1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
I don't know where this is.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,820
I'm just gonna ignore.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,880
There you go.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:06,660
There you go.

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,200
Now it should be on the game.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm scared.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,860
I don't know what this is.

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,520
You can wishlist a game right now.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,600
Pretty sure you get some goodies if you wishlist as well, right?

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:23,900
Yeah.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,520
Right now.

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,260
And watch the stream.

13
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,420
The stream where it drops.

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,160
For keys to pay.

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,910
Now the best thumbnail.

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,070
There you go.

17
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:44,450
I'm a professional.

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,810
Is it working?

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,070
Yay!

20
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:48,990
Okay.

21
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,190
I'm pinning it.

22
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,540
Wow.

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:57,960
Wow.

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,900
How's that?

25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,460
Did it work?

26
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,280
Yes.

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,320
Wait, they got one of the Osu goats.

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,620
Yeah, they got a lot of Osu players.

29
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,180
Oh, they got MREC?

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,320
Oh.

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,040
No, MREC is someone...

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,760
It's like... That's an OG.

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,160
That's like Jesus.

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680
We have BCMC in here too.

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
Oh no, Jesus.

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,150
I like to play music.

37
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,010
There we go.

38
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,410
It's on Fate Trigger now.

39
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,090
For reals.

40
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,790
For real, real?

41
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,730
For reals, reals.

42
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,630
Oh wait, we have a full team now.

43
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,410
I've been here.

44
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,030
Oh wait.

45
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,730
Have you though?

46
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,450
Is that like a...

47
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,930
Is that a dropbox though?

48
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,870
That's why they were talking in the Discord.

49
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,970
Hey, is Yazdesk Refraz you?

50
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,270
Is there a dropbox?

51
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,410
Is it just a free-for-all?

52
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,410
I think it's a free-for-all.

53
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,150
It's a free-for-all.

54
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:58,370
It's a free-for-all.

55
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,390
I was watching the tournament and it's been free-for-all.

56
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,070
You guys want to hot drop?

57
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,050
I like... I like dropping on the ship, dude.

58
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,410
Let's hot drop on Fun and then teabag him.

59
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,890
Oh, we're entering.

60
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,570
Oh, he's got a filter tower.

61
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,050
Alright.

62
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,210
I got it.

63
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,110
I'm confirming my tier.

64
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,270
By the way, to my chat, I have to be DokiBird too.

65
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,290
Cause someone took DokiBird.

66
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,330
So there's a DokiBird one out there.

67
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,990
How do we know you're not the clone?

68
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,130
I'm literally sponsored.

69
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,310
If the real DokiBird was here...

70
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,130
He would be sponsored.

71
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,230
I don't know.

72
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,890
You could have just fooled the devs.

73
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,290
That seems fake.

74
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,190
These fake DokiBirds are pretty crafty.

75
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,330
Say something real Doki would say.

76
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,190
Say something...

77
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,410
Saibao.

78
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,450
Fucking ban her devs.

79
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,890
RPR taught me that word.

80
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,110
And what does that word mean?

81
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,510
I don't even watch TikTok.

82
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,230
What does it mean, RPR?

83
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,290
What does Saibao mean?

84
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,630
I don't know.

85
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,550
I don't know.

86
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,410
I was trying to figure that out on my own.

87
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,810
I'm too old for TikTok.

88
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,210
I'm calling Doki a bitch.

89
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,710
Yeah.

90
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,190
I play Marvel Rivals.

91
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,610
My silly math group.

92
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,650
I'm gonna get cancelled.

93
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,210
I'm surprised you haven't yet.

94
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,150
I'm gonna relinquish this.

95
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,670
Oh, he has the EU privilege.

96
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,530
That's why.

97
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,250
Oh, yeah.

98
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,070
They're uncancellable.

99
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,090
Because he's racist.

100
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,610
What the hell do you mean?

101
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,750
I've never said anything cancelable in my life.

102
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,150
He said the C word.

103
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,430
What did I say?

104
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,670
Yeah, he said the C word.

105
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:37,750
Blanker.

106
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,930
Yeah, and he said he got the pass.

107
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,890
But I don't think he did.

108
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,190
He's a VTuber.

109
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,410
He's got the pass for Blanker.

110
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,150
Dude, listen.

111
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,930
I might not have aim assist.

112
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,670
Yeah, I can tell.

113
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,250
You literally have less damage than me last game.

114
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,230
Yeah, I can tell.

115
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,810
There's a team back on the red thing back there.

116
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,170
I might die first, guys.

117
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,610
T to detach.

118
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,650
I'm out of here.

119
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,670
Oh, okay.

120
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,830
I got my Cantius.

121
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:06,770
Let's go.

122
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,330
The auto loot is in my favor.

123
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,030
No gun, no gun.

124
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:18,050
If you don't know the OP guns yet, it's Cantius, Gladiator, the auto shotgun, and the Jackson.

125
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,850
Yay.

126
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,990
I got my Cantius and my Gladiator.

127
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,550
Yeah, I'm playing Gladiator auto shotgun every game.

128
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:26,630
There's a sniper.

129
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:26,950
Oh, wait.

130
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,870
There's another Cantius here.

131
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,130
So his shotgun just like...

132
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,910
The auto shotgun is really good for Sinric too.

133
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,190
I play it on this character because like my goal is to go in and go one for one.

134
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,190
Like I...

135
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,070
Because of my ult, you know?

136
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,510
So I need to go in.

137
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,370
I can't find armor.

138
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,430
I have white armor.

139
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,470
Oh, wait.

140
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,270
There's houses down here.

141
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,590
I'm going to go get a little.

142
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,150
Oh, yeah.

143
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,970
For those who don't know what this game is.

144
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,190
It's basically anime girl battle royale.

145
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,150
Time for a great game.

146
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,850
Oh, shit.

147
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,550
Yeah.

148
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,970
And you can download the...

149
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,530
You can wishlist...

150
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,250
I can't download it.

151
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,330
You can wishlist the game right now.

152
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,410
And sign up for the closed beta.

153
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,970
And if you watch our streams, you might get the drops for the keys.

154
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,650
All right, guys.

155
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,010
I need you guys to pick it up on the show.

156
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,470
Oh, my God.

157
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:12,810
Backpack.

158
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,370
Blue backpack.

159
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,930
Blue backpack.

160
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,010
Blue backpack.

161
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,170
Exploding in the background.

162
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,050
That was a door, my bad.

163
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,870
I found a gladiator.

164
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,970
Oh, my God.

165
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,150
We're all sponsored here.

166
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,550
And I got auto shotgun.

167
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:25,330
All right.

168
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,070
We got some good stuff.

169
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:26,630
All right.

170
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,710
I got gladiator auto shotgun.

171
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,190
Fly over to you guys.

172
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,490
We need a whip.

173
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,830
We do need a car, though.

174
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,630
I got three times on my gladi.

175
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,530
Is that...

176
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,130
Yeah, it's good.

177
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,110
The gladi...

178
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,970
The gladi is a beam.

179
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,790
It just got nerfed, but it's still really good.

180
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,030
All right.

181
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,430
Blue armor.

182
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,710
I think I need a compensator for you.

183
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,830
It just got nerfed.

184
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,230
There's a sniper here if anyone wants it.

185
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,170
Oh, there's 3x.

186
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,850
There's a 3x here, too.

187
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,950
These items should be shared with everyone.

188
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,350
I can get a sniper.

189
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,690
I got one.

190
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,110
I got one.

191
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,890
Here's a...

192
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,730
Here's a...

193
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,310
Auto shotty.

194
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,890
There's also DMR.

195
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,310
Who's gonna be using the auto shotty?

196
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,990
Yeah, I'm good on DMR.

197
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:02,870
Meh.

198
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,190
Is there fall damage?

199
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,750
I don't think so.

200
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,650
There's a purple mag for that DMR if you want.

201
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,490
Guys, is there fall damage?

202
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:11,630
Yes.

203
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,430
No, no.

204
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,510
No.

205
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,130
No.

206
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:14,610
Okay.

207
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,350
There's fall damage.

208
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,550
There's literally fall damage.

209
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,290
Why are you lying?

210
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,350
From high enough, there's fall damage.

211
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,130
How high, though?

212
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,350
There's not.

213
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,490
I've literally pulled mid-air and jumped down and didn't take full damage.

214
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,230
Yeah.

215
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,330
We could...

216
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,050
We could go up here.

217
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:27,630
Up here.

218
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,770
Yeah, let's loot.

219
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,850
Yeah, we gotta try to get purples.

220
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,690
Get purples and juice up on school piercers and shit.

221
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,070
Let's get school piercers and, like, all that shit.

222
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,230
Take this car, though.

223
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,050
I didn't see...

224
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,370
Yeah, I will.

225
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,870
I didn't see if anyone landed up here.

226
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,950
But there could be.

227
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,310
I don't...

228
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,030
I don't see either, but...

229
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,910
We just...

230
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,950
I know that there was people to our west, but yeah.

231
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,250
Should we get an armor car?

232
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:52,970
Or should we all...

233
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,530
One early fight wouldn't be bad.

234
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,350
Probably everyone in blue armors and shit.

235
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,410
That's true.

236
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,450
I mean, we could...

237
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,610
I mean, if we lose, though...

238
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,030
That'd be a free fight.

239
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,570
I never lose.

240
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,070
I feel like I should not be...

241
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,270
...allowed to drive.

242
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,050
I feel like, as the guy with the most ping, I think you're right.

243
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,410
Take this fucking driver.

244
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,650
He's driving into a frickin' wall.

245
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,550
I don't think there's anyone there.

246
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,370
I'm just doing extra...

247
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:17,650
Oh, wait.

248
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,470
Wait, wait, wait.

249
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,410
Pick up smokes, guys.

250
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,770
Smokes is real important.

251
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,370
He's...

252
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:22,750
He's leaving us.

253
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,230
Incendiaries are also insane.

254
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,350
Yeah.

255
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,650
34 left us.

256
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,630
Flashbang is not so much.

257
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:28,910
You guys were looting.

258
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,610
I thought we robbed you.

259
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,150
Nothing picked up on skin.

260
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,510
Oh, I don't have enough to craft.

261
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,110
Now we're just gonna rob him to him.

262
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,270
What if we get shot in the cross?

263
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,790
I'm the support.

264
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,950
Alright.

265
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,690
We can take this TP to mainline, so we can be here forever.

266
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,130
Apparently, people are saying there's no fall damage, but you can fall off the map.

267
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,030
Yeah, but if you do that, it means you just didn't press space bar.

268
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,630
Oh, did you actually see the packet loss?

269
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,170
I'm pretty sure it's impossible to fly off the map because the game stops you from it.

270
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,550
You can literally glide under the map.

271
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,690
If final circle's near the edge, you just jump off and glide.

272
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,710
I don't like stall time.

273
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,870
Wait, really?

274
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,610
Yeah, people do that.

275
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,090
People are doing that in higher ranks.

276
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,310
Oh, there's a- Isn't there like a teleporter thing you can put down there?

277
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,850
There's an item.

278
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,730
There's an item, yeah.

279
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,650
It's from care packages and the harmonizer.

280
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,870
There's a 4X here if anyone needs it.

281
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,510
Emergency TP.

282
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,830
There's a purple.

283
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,170
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,170
That TP's broken for endgame.

285
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,870
There's a purple helmet, too.

286
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,750
Purple, purple, purple.

287
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,010
Purple.

288
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,230
Purple, all purple.

289
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:35,370
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,110
Okay, grab this armor.

291
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,710
There is...

292
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,750
Does anyone need a 4x?

293
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,430
Wait, this space is insane.

294
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,110
What the hell?

295
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:43,990
Yeah, there's this.

296
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,650
I got a lot of shit there.

297
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,270
This building's nuts.

298
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,650
There's another purple on the roof up here.

299
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,810
Purple sniper mag.

300
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,070
Purple AR mag.

301
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,290
Two purple AR mags.

302
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,510
And there's another purple here.

303
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,410
Ah, we're good.

304
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,590
We should just farm money now.

305
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,750
Yeah, we just need our upgrades.

306
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,450
I have money.

307
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,850
We ideally want to play for the harmonizers as soon as they come up on ring close.

308
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,070
Yeah, I'm ready.

309
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,710
Harmonize.

310
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,410
We've got a minute and a half.

311
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,450
I'm sticking close to you guys.

312
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,410
I'm going to take a car over to the upgrades.

313
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,010
Oh, I want to.

314
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,090
No, take me with you.

315
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,790
Take me with you.

316
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,670
I have enough upgrade too.

317
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,550
What is harmonizer chat?

318
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,190
It's this.

319
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:30,790
It's the...

320
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,110
Also, you can drop your extra money.

321
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,910
Oh, it's not this, guys.

322
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,330
You can drop your extra money to teammates, by the way.

323
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,070
What is the harmonizer?

324
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,010
Harmonizer, you know the...

325
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,390
You know the big three-story building that has, like, got the in it?

326
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,830
When you open inventory, bottom right supply point.

327
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:45,450
That's the money.

328
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,450
That's the harmonizer.

329
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,670
How much money, you guys?

330
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,470
I only have 60.

331
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,970
There's one more impact mod here if you want it.

332
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,230
I have $30.

333
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,150
$30.

334
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,210
Yeah, impact is good.

335
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,510
That's first aid.

336
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,070
Wait, I can buy a gun that heals.

337
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,090
Yeah, do it.

338
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,410
Can I have some money, guys?

339
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,150
Uh...

340
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,350
No.

341
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,450
Wait, I have 30.

342
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,830
I thought I'd give you 30.

343
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,770
Here.

344
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,610
Here's 30.

345
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,510
I need 10 more for a gun upgrade.

346
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,930
I don't get what I need.

347
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,770
I'll give you 10 here.

348
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,190
Good boy.

349
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:22,330
Okay.

350
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,850
Alright.

351
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,890
Shut the fuck up.

352
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,090
Dude, he was crouched on the ground waiting for it.

353
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,830
And he has, like, a little dog mask on, too.

354
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm gonna get mulliganed.

355
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,460
Alright, where do we go?

356
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,080
Let's go.

357
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,900
Can we just hit the teleporter?

358
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,920
Alright, let me...

359
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,300
Let me...

360
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,860
Let me...

361
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,240
Let me...

362
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,740
Let me get the...

363
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,940
Get out, Drew.

364
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,000
Get out of it.

365
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,800
Oh, yeah.

366
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,440
Oh, you're right.

367
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,000
Here, RPI.

368
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,300
I'll jump.

369
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,640
You do it.

370
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,120
I don't know why you wanted this one in particular so much.

371
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,440
It was mine.

372
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,480
I parked it.

373
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,140
You parked it, bro.

374
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,220
What are you sure for?

375
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,220
Where are we going?

376
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,660
We'll hang out, like...

377
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,180
No one pinged the giant thing.

378
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,100
I'm gonna grab this.

379
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,340
I was like, why are we driving away from it?

380
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,200
I mean, that portal is a portal, too.

381
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,520
I mean, I feel like we should have went through the portal.

382
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,100
Yeah, we're just gonna play...

383
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,140
We can just play around the portal and wait for the zone to pop and see where we gotta go.

384
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,540
Well, he meant the big portal.

385
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,340
What's the big portal?

386
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,160
Oh, that portal.

387
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,520
What's this?

388
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
I'm just gonna hang out here.

389
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,560
Wait for...

390
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,200
Wait to see zone.

391
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,000
There's...

392
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,340
Oh, dude, I'm gonna adjust the volume, everybody.

393
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,860
Oh, my God.

394
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,460
I thought this said Mount Femdom.

395
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,860
It says Mount Fenton.

396
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,020
What?

397
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,520
What?

398
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,380
Are you okay?

399
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,280
Did you get a...

400
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,700
Yeah, did you get a stroke just now?

401
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,560
I don't even want to know what's in your Twitter feed, bro.

402
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,800
You think it's Mount Femdom?

403
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,200
I mean, he...

404
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,920
I don't even use Twitter, man.

405
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,160
What's on your TikTok?

406
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,460
What do you get on your TikTok?

407
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,520
I don't even use TikTok.

408
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,240
How did you get Saipao from?

409
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,560
You said you got Brigger on it.

410
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,160
You said TikTok.

411
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,600
Yeah, you said TikTok to us.

412
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,000
It's like all YouTube shorts are just reused TikToks.

413
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,820
You don't know that.

414
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,540
They could be YouTube shorts original.

415
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,680
Which is just TikTok on them.

416
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,500
How do you know that?

417
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,200
How do you know that?

418
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,700
You have to watch TikTok to know that.

419
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,800
Because it says on the bottom of the short, you can see the TikTok thing.

420
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,940
There's TikTok.

421
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,100
It's called a for you page for a reason.

422
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,640
If you're seeing that, then that means you're living.

423
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,660
Okay, you guys are making me fun for not using social media and being healthy in the brain, dude.

424
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,100
Thanks.

425
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,800
You healthy in the brain?

426
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,800
I don't play VR chat.

427
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,020
I drink in there.

428
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,800
I don't.

429
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,280
You play VR chat.

430
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,160
Oh, that's not playing.

431
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:34,920
That's not playing.

432
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,740
Social media.

433
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,220
Jen talks about drinking two seconds later, which is literally rotting your brain.

434
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,300
Yeah.

435
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,120
And what's wrong with alcohol?

436
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,020
I like it.

437
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,040
To be fair.

438
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,700
He is European.

439
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,100
Breathing air is bad for you.

440
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
He is salvic.

441
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,560
Harmonizer is spawned.

442
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,760
So what is the Harmonizer?

443
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,580
It's the big circle on the map.

444
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,160
Oh.

445
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,060
Should we get another strong boy?

446
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,280
Strong vehicle?

447
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,160
Maybe.

448
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,040
We have to turn around.

449
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,660
I'm going the wrong way.

450
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,920
I'll take it.

451
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,400
Why do we fall?

452
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:14,840
Oh, wait.

453
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,560
We're going to get another CP.

454
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,120
You're just like right behind him.

455
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,620
How are you so fast?

456
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,360
There might be a team at the Harmonizer already.

457
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:26,920
Oh, my God.

458
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,900
Imagine they're camping us.

459
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,960
Oh, my God.

460
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,920
I didn't kill the effect.

461
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,860
I had a game where I came through one of these TPs and people set up a roadblock.

462
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,360
Oh.

463
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,720
Should have had vehicles in front of it.

464
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,200
Very good.

465
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,820
That sounds scary.

466
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,580
Is it safe?

467
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,420
Oh, it's safe.

468
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:39,940
Oh, my God.

469
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,240
You come out fast out of that one.

470
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,960
There's no one on this armor.

471
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,920
Are you guys okay?

472
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,020
Like, this is a team game, bro.

473
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,820
Stop pushing me.

474
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,420
We're doing bumper cars right now.

475
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,600
I haven't even touched you, bro.

476
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,260
Yeah.

477
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,300
Why are you...

478
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,040
Why are you so insulted?

479
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,520
I'm just giving...

480
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,140
What the fuck is going on?

481
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,180
Did you see Humby killed like 80 people?

482
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,400
Well, he just killed one squad, yeah.

483
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,520
Yeah.

484
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,960
I think that this...

485
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,160
I think there's no one here, because I'm pretty sure the beam is a different color if there's people here.

486
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,380
So, we should be fine.

487
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,500
I thought green means they're taking it.

488
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:11,820
That was it?

489
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,260
I don't know.

490
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,020
No, no, no, no.

491
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,420
There's no one in there.

492
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,400
I mean, I can just scan.

493
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,120
Just give it a scan.

494
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,560
Yeah, give it a scan.

495
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,980
You're the only one that's played the most out of all of us.

496
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,300
Oh.

497
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,080
Yeah, we're good.

498
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,860
We'll start capping.

499
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,400
What color is it when you're taking it?

500
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:23,760
Liar.

501
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,820
It's like red or orange or something.

502
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,280
Okay.

503
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,080
Wait, let me look now.

504
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,680
I'm going to sit on the roof if you guys want to stay in the bottom floor.

505
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:29,940
Okay, I'll be here.

506
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,800
You have to stay in the bottom floor in the circle.

507
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Okay, I'm in.

508
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,920
Okay, I'm in.

509
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,060
Okay, I'm...

510
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,300
Wait, use cars as blockaded.

511
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,980
Oh, that's true.

512
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,240
Where's our other car?

513
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,040
I don't know.

514
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,600
You're just going to be throwing them bitches around.

515
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,540
Alright.

516
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,300
I'm harmonizing.

517
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,820
Wait, me too.

518
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm harmonizing.

519
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,040
I think they sped up the cap speed for this because it used to be really slow.

520
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,680
Yeah, I remember.

521
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,260
Yeah, yeah.

522
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,320
Is there anything good?

523
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:01,900
I was slow.

524
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,200
No.

525
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,260
I picked it all up.

526
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,080
I'm harmonizing.

527
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,200
We're kind of centered so we don't have to worry too much for it.

528
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,300
I hope I don't get shot at.

529
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,760
Yeah, reach on.

530
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,380
Cause I'm tabbing out.

531
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,000
Is the red shotgun good?

532
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,980
Red shotgun?

533
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,220
I haven't seen a care package shotgun.

534
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,500
Isn't there one?

535
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,060
There's a SMG, LMG, Sniper, and GL.

536
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,180
Oh, it's GL what I'm thinking about.

537
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,340
Oh, that's the gold package.

538
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,100
That's the gold package.

539
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:31,760
Get back.

540
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,640
We should pick that up.

541
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,220
It's pretty close.

542
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm going to go grab that.

543
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,140
Actually, RPO, you should go get it.

544
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,880
Cause you don't have gold armor.

545
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,080
Oh, hey, there's a...

546
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,400
Oh, go ahead.

547
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,380
There's a...

548
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,160
Oh, a planet cracker load?

549
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,680
It sucked.

550
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,680
I hate that one.

551
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,200
Yeah.

552
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,760
There's people on it.

553
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,200
There's people on it.

554
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:46,980
Okay, okay.

555
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,720
Just fuck off it.

556
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,220
Fuck off it.

557
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,420
I'm gonna shoot.

558
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,340
I'm gonna go...

559
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,060
I'm gonna go roof.

560
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm still harmonizing.

561
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,840
I cracked one.

562
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,720
He's got gold armor.

563
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm harmonizing.

564
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,900
Yeah, he got the gold armor from the thing probably.

565
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,300
Yeah, they're just leaving.

566
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,020
Yeah, I cracked him.

567
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,000
One guy's still on it, yeah.

568
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,960
I'm just gonna move around just in case I don't get shot.

569
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,060
They beat us to it.

570
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,740
Damn.

571
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,380
Let's go there.

572
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,520
Do you want the, uh, the Krayber if there is one, Shafar?

573
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,480
Sure.

574
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,680
Yeah, I'm gonna get a sniper, enjoy.

575
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,460
I love a sniper.

576
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,840
There's a gold armor?

577
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,700
It's SMG and LMG.

578
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,840
There's self-rescue kit.

579
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,280
I'm gonna take this.

580
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,100
And then there's a Tempest, guys.

581
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,920
Tempest is fucking broken, dude.

582
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Does anyone want the emergency?

583
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,080
Does anyone want the self-rescue kit?

584
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,300
I'm dropping a self-rescue kit here if one of you want it.

585
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:41,820
I don't need it.

586
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,940
There's also a shield here.

587
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,080
Emergency shield.

588
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,560
Who has the TP?

589
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,120
I have the TP.

590
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,480
You want it?

591
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,320
Yeah, yeah.

592
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:49,880
Slide it to me.

593
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,680
And then just take one of the self-reses.

594
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,200
I have self-rescue ready.

595
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,700
There's another one here.

596
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,480
Do you all have one?

597
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,980
Can I have two?

598
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,440
I think so.

599
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,620
Do you all have a self-res?

600
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,200
I don't need them, so I don't want to pick one up.

601
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,000
Grab it.

602
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,780
Yeah, you should get it.

603
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,140
Yeah, grab it.

604
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,760
There's two on the floor.

605
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,040
It's a gold thing.

606
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,740
You just walked over it.

607
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,880
You can't carry two, by the way.

608
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,660
Yeah, make it run.

609
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,660
Okay, Doki, take this.

610
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,540
She has.

611
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
We need an emergency shield.

612
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,640
We got a guy with an emergency shield.

613
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,400
It's still pretty good.

614
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,600
It drops a bubble on the floor.

615
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,640
Another airdrop?

616
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,580
Should I go for this for gold?

617
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,580
Yeah.

618
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,620
Yeah, let's go for it.

619
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,460
We're just going to land.

620
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,420
Can you ping it where it lands?

621
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,540
I pinged it.

622
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:27,940
It's red ping.

623
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,680
We can look for it.

624
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,660
If there's people on it, we just go back to where we were.

625
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,180
Okay.

626
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,960
There was a team here near it before.

627
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,200
Oh, people are still fighting.

628
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,920
Our spot was kind of broken, though.

629
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,460
We should go back.

630
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,660
Yeah, we'll go back.

631
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,220
You guys should maybe go back.

632
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,720
Okay.

633
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,020
I'm sure for now, we can anchor.

634
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,820
I gotta protect you guys.

635
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,400
Do you not want to anchor?

636
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,280
Two grown men.

637
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,080
We'll be fine.

638
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,480
Yeah.

639
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,060
They don't need a guardian.

640
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm giving an overwatch.

641
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,660
There's a Kraber here.

642
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,160
It's a Kraber.

643
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,780
Oh.

644
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,640
Well, do I go back now?

645
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,820
You go take the Kraber.

646
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,500
We go back.

647
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,400
Okay.

648
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,740
Okay.

649
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,580
Okay.

650
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,980
Moving around again.

651
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,320
Oh, you want the Kraber, don't you?

652
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:13,820
There's a car.

653
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,080
There's a car.

654
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,980
There's a car.

655
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,760
There's a car.

656
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,760
Oh.

657
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,140
Are you fighting?

658
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:17,800
They're fighting.

659
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,080
They're fighting.

660
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,240
I'm good.

661
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,480
I'm good.

662
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,220
They're running away.

663
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:20,800
They're running.

664
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,840
They wanted the Kraber, bro.

665
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,640
Yeah, they wanted the Kraber.

666
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,680
Yeah, they just wanted to zone them off of it.

667
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,580
That's my Kraber.

668
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,880
Yeah, it's his.

669
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,760
They run to the...

670
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,760
Alright.

671
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:30,980
Let's go.

672
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,640
Alright, I'm waiting in the car.

673
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,900
I hope I don't get shot at.

674
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,840
I'm gonna grab that stock in the shop.

675
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,760
Do you think there's people up there now?

676
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,300
I'm worried that we lost their spot.

677
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,020
I can scan.

678
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:44,980
Yeah.

679
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,560
We're going back.

680
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,180
Alright.

681
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,540
Well, the Surefour and I die, remember us.

682
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,420
We're not stuck, are we?

683
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,440
Bro.

684
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,600
I think we might be stuck.

685
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,260
We'll do a little left.

686
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,020
A little right.

687
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:57,820
Left.

688
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,920
Oh, we got the other.

689
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,640
Alright, we got it.

690
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,860
Alright, I wait.

691
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,520
How the fuck did you do that?

692
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,080
Is that range?

693
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,440
I wish I knew.

694
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,040
Alright.

695
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,800
No one's there, so we're safe.

696
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,980
My lipstick locust didn't pick anyone up on CN.

697
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,400
Good lipstick.

698
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,480
Nice.

699
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Looks good on you.

700
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,900
Lipstick brings all the boys to his yard.

701
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,840
Third life.

702
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,340
Better than yours.

703
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,820
I parked my car inside.

704
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,960
I have 500 moolah, dude.

705
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,300
I could buy a bunch of shit.

706
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,480
Oh, yeah.

707
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,940
Is there an upgrade station nearby?

708
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,900
There's one across.

709
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,560
But then we would have to give up our spot.

710
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,660
Yeah, we'd have to give it up.

711
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,720
Is that worth it?

712
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,380
Oh, yeah.

713
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,140
There's still 12.

714
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,300
I'm gonna see if it's open, man.

715
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,840
Okay.

716
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,600
Okay, yeah.

717
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,720
We'll anchor this fire cells.

718
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,400
There's people in the house.

719
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,980
Should we stay on the roof or what?

720
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,020
So they know we're here?

721
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,380
The roof is weird.

722
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,340
They...

723
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,620
There's no one here.

724
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,900
I'm crouched in this corner.

725
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,600
They'll never know.

726
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm worried to get shot.

727
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,860
Chill, chill.

728
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,360
Hey, what's that?

729
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,060
Just don't get shot.

730
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,280
I'm gonna throw a shark in here.

731
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,720
That's the drop.

732
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,380
Okay, I think we're good.

733
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,800
That's the drop.

734
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,820
I hear a car.

735
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,220
I do too.

736
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,820
Yeah, just get your upgrades.

737
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,340
I'll watch you and then I'll upgrade.

738
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,860
Oh, I'm in perfect positioning.

739
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,360
Alright.

740
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,340
Oh my gosh.

741
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,600
You're proning?

742
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,300
You're proning?

743
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,800
Sure for it?

744
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,020
Let me get a shotgun.

745
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:19,940
Eeeeeee.

746
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,560
Oh my gosh.

747
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,740
Everybody is so sweaty.

748
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,620
Nobody has fully died yet.

749
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,400
Alright.

750
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,080
Go, go, go, go.

751
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,420
You're next.

752
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:27,780
Bro!

753
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,420
We're stuck on the door.

754
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,180
We're stuck on the door.

755
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,600
We're stuck on the door.

756
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,260
We're stuck on the door.

757
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:30,900
You guys are...

758
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,540
You guys are too thick.

759
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,020
Too thick for the doors.

760
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,080
Someone got right over.

761
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,240
Door stuck.

762
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,560
Wait.

763
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,780
I saw a scan over there.

764
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,520
Wait.

765
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,000
Can you ping?

766
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,160
I'm trying to.

767
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,620
I saw a scan.

768
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,760
Yeah, there's people in that building.

769
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,620
Alright, we gotta go.

770
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,020
They're fighting in this thing in front of us, Maka.

771
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,380
Yeah, yeah, let's just dip.

772
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,160
I didn't even show up.

773
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,040
I was gonna say, I threw a party from the car like you drive us kinda near.

774
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,480
I didn't even show up on my screen.

775
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,940
Yeah, we could take over each.

776
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,860
Yeah, like from here.

777
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,840
What the fuck did you mark?

778
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:02,920
If I see one, I just smoke them.

779
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,360
No, they're just sitting in that diner.

780
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,820
Yeah, they're in the building.

781
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,840
They definitely killed someone.

782
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,180
Or attempted to kill someone.

783
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,760
There's people over there.

784
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,160
We're coming.

785
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,120
This car is kinda slow.

786
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,600
Oh, okay.

787
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,020
I see it.

788
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,120
Okay, I see the thing.

789
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,880
Okay, wait.

790
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,040
We should play a different spot, no?

791
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,100
Like maybe here?

792
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,400
We can play like high to low from here, I think.

793
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,240
Right?

794
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,700
Oh, yeah.

795
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:24,720
Yeah.

796
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,560
Isn't our walk-in kind of...

797
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,880
I need to adjust the line.

798
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,540
We should probably...

799
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:33,660
Instead of keeping these cars, we should keep the flying cars so we can fly over the ravine.

800
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,600
We can use both.

801
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,900
This car is really strong.

802
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,860
The armor is really really strong.

803
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,920
But this one can fly over, can it?

804
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,700
No, it can't.

805
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,380
But I mean, I can just glide if it comes to it.

806
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,440
Yeah.

807
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,140
So yeah, there's no way to fly...

808
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,820
No way to fly...

809
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,000
This is concerning, that hill order.

810
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,660
Oh, hey!

811
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,540
One spot's dead!

812
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,920
We're not last.

813
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,860
Not give me...

814
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,620
Zva ult.

815
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,100
Where?

816
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,980
Double Zva ult.

817
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,920
Give me ult.

818
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,940
It's interesting.

819
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,280
I can't, bro.

820
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,380
I'm programmed like that.

821
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,280
Yes, Vielen Unders.

822
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,920
You made me seen on the ref.

823
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,380
Can I, like, pop some shots?

824
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:07,900
Yeah, yeah.

825
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,720
I don't think we can't do anything about it...

826
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,160
It's one outside.

827
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:11,980
Sure, yeah.

828
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,340
Crack them.

829
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,260
we're not chilling like here.

830
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,700
We're gonna chill in here.

831
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,200
Knocked!

832
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,840
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.

833
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,440
Nice!

834
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:18,820
Knock!

835
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,340
Wait, do we help?

836
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,840
We're not pushing.

837
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,040
We're not pushing.

838
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,080
We're not pushing...

839
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
We're gonna push those two teams.

840
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:22,900
Yeah...

841
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,700
We're helping for all...

842
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,780
Just make sure no one walks in behind us on our North.

843
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,280
Yeah...

844
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm staying prone down this building.

845
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,440
North?

846
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,100
Where's North?

847
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,360
He's prone to building.

848
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,960
North is at the top of your map.

849
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,680
I was looking at my compass and I was turning around to make sure I know where North is.

850
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,760
North is straight up.

851
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,240
That's true.

852
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,040
Glad you know where your compass is at the very least.

853
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,060
Yeah, I know my cardinal direction.

854
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,900
Let's meet up there.

855
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm proud.

856
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,560
I'm doing it, guys.

857
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,400
That's better something.

858
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,040
On the roof, on the roof.

859
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,000
All right, zero.

860
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,260
Eh.

861
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm walking.

862
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,880
I'm beaming these guys.

863
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,840
Zero damage?

864
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,620
I'm doing it?

865
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,420
Oh, these guys are outside the zone?

866
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,800
Yeah, yeah.

867
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,820
We should probably ...

868
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,320
Can you keep that?

869
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,720
They might come to us though.

870
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,240
Because our ridge is in here.

871
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,880
Wait, there's a car right here.

872
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,840
There's a car, ...

873
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,080
Yo, Mac.

874
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,420
I think they're gonna come to us here.

875
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,800
Wait, there's a car that's just driving.

876
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,060
You guys hold that side?

877
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,700
We'll hold this side.

878
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,720
We'll try.

879
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,600
They're definitely gonna come to us because they can't...

880
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,980
Uh, they might go for these houses though.

881
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,240
I'm holding.

882
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,640
Oh, I'm holding.

883
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:21,720
They're not.

884
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,440
It seems like they're all in here soon.

885
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,080
Yeah, but they don't...

886
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,800
We've got any edges on here.

887
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,880
He's not.

888
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,720
That's true.

889
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,380
Look at the roof.

890
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:29,720
Look at the roof.

891
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,220
They might fly.

892
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,120
You're shooting at me, bro.

893
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,520
I don't think the people... You guys are even shooting at a rendering for me.

894
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,480
They're here.

895
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,660
Turn up your view distance.

896
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,980
I think it's at max.

897
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,680
PC gap, I guess.

898
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,100
I don't know.

899
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,720
Maybe you're right here.

900
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,080
Oh, he just got gunned.

901
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,260
View range extreme.

902
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,260
Yeah, you didn't have your view range up.

903
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,320
I didn't max your rendering.

904
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,880
I still can't see them.

905
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,160
They might just be at us at a render distance.

906
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,180
I mean, Doki can anchor there with their TP.

907
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,780
And then you can come up to us if you want.

908
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,260
Unless I get fucked up.

909
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,980
Maybe we shouldn't use our TP now when we gotta move.

910
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,180
Yeah, we have to move, though.

911
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,820
The zone's pushing us.

912
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,780
We're not gonna TP.

913
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,360
If she gets pushed, she can TP us back.

914
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:16,680
Wait, wait.

915
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,660
The zone is pushing in.

916
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,220
What do we do?

917
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,020
Yeah, yeah.

918
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,580
We're gonna get out.

919
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,660
Get out of the fucking car.

920
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,480
Bro, you're not letting me get in, dude.

921
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,580
Thank you.

922
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,440
He's bullying me, dude.

923
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,120
We should get his hill.

924
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,520
Get his hill.

925
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,240
Yeah, we're gonna go here.

926
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,220
This hill here is in.

927
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,100
Hello.

928
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,820
There's a car behind you.

929
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,380
You should grab that one.

930
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,560
We just hold this ridge and make sure no one walks into us.

931
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,060
You want me to drive?

932
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,760
Look here, look here.

933
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,880
The car is the better.

934
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,440
Roger.

935
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,160
I don't have a lot of experience driving.

936
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,860
Just drive in there and then get out.

937
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,360
They're in the zone.

938
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,100
They're gonna race in the zone.

939
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,760
What if I die?

940
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,360
There's two teams.

941
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,760
Keep in mind.

942
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,700
I don't think the team died.

943
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,380
Someone else drive?

944
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,580
I'm gonna move the car for her.

945
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,060
No, you got it.

946
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,040
You're getting ganked from somewhere else.

947
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,920
I believe in you.

948
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,160
I'm gonna drive up and play kind of psycho.

949
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,620
Okay.

950
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,780
There's a team here.

951
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,660
On the right.

952
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:02,960
On the right.

953
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,660
Scraper these guys.

954
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,220
Scraper these guys.

955
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,320
I see him.

956
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,060
On the right?

957
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,380
Yeah, on the right.

958
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,000
Crack one.

959
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,860
He smoked it though.

960
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,700
Team on the left might be racing in zone.

961
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,920
Where were they?

962
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,280
I don't know.

963
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:14,920
Yeah, they are.

964
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,740
It doesn't hurt that bad yet.

965
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,860
It's gonna hurt bad on that.

966
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,620
I'm looking at my left.

967
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,540
Oh yeah, one's knocked.

968
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:20,940
One's knocked.

969
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,740
I'm trying to find.

970
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,760
I find, I think.

971
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,640
I knocked.

972
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,600
Yeah, I find him.

973
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,380
I'm looking at my left.

974
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,180
I don't see anyone.

975
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,720
This space over here by me, we can't give up.

976
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:29,940
Okay?

977
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,980
This space here.

978
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,460
Okay, if you want to anchor that.

979
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,140
Which space?

980
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,000
Guys, have a knock over here.

981
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,460
We can do racing.

982
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,520
Okay.

983
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,840
I'll look at that side.

984
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,540
Where's the knock?

985
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,040
It's right behind us.

986
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,600
Over there.

987
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,240
I knocked the guy here on the left.

988
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,540
Mac.

989
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,620
Outside here.

990
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,540
Wait, there's a floaty car behind us.

991
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,440
Floaty car behind us.

992
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,240
Wait, ping.

993
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,160
Oh, I see.

994
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,480
I see.

995
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,880
These pins are so slow.

996
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,960
These guys are coming in the car.

997
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:53,960
It's me.

998
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,400
It's me.

999
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,140
It's me.

1000
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,340
It's me.

1001
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,400
There is an actual car.

1002
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:00,840
Look at the car.

1003
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,360
Look at the car.

1004
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,120
Wait, I'm so confused.

1005
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,000
Bro, your name didn't render, bro.

1006
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,620
Wait on the map.

1007
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,840
It rendered for me.

1008
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,700
You're shooting me.

1009
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,740
I'm fucking demons again.

1010
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,440
Oh, these are full killed.

1011
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,080
These are full killed.

1012
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,800
This guy ulted.

1013
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,380
Ulted on the right.

1014
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:14,780
Yeah.

1015
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,120
I want to loot this guy.

1016
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,580
I'm out of ammo.

1017
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,960
Where do you want me to look at?

1018
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,880
I'm anchoring the spot over here.

1019
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,520
There's a car here.

1020
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,900
I'm getting the other car.

1021
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,300
I'm coming over.

1022
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,220
I cracked the guy in the car.

1023
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,820
Armored car.

1024
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,340
I think RPI and UCF at 59 so we can get the rest.

1025
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,160
We can save.

1026
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,040
Dude, his name didn't render.

1027
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,220
There's people over here too.

1028
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,000
Yo, cover me.

1029
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,380
Cover me.

1030
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,020
Yo, can you heal me?

1031
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,440
They got some poison on me or some shit.

1032
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,240
Yeah, I can.

1033
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,540
I'm heading over.

1034
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,580
They're shooting corrosive rounds.

1035
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,700
I'm going to pick him up.

1036
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,220
I'm going to pick him up.

1037
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,640
I got you.

1038
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:46,860
Wait.

1039
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,820
I'm using my...

1040
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:49,860
Put it down.

1041
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,000
Put it down.

1042
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,720
Put it down.

1043
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,060
Put it down.

1044
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,480
Put it down.

1045
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,640
It's okay.

1046
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,140
I have my own shield.

1047
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,440
I'm good.

1048
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,060
Okay, okay.

1049
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:56,740
I'm waiting.

1050
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,120
They're trying to push.

1051
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,020
Ready?

1052
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,620
Cover.

1053
00:26:59,820 --> 00:26:59,860
Cover.

1054
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,100
Cover.

1055
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,280
Cover.

1056
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:00,940
Cover.

1057
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:00,960
Cover.

1058
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,260
Cover.

1059
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,220
Cover.

1060
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:03,600
Cover.

1061
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,560
Just in case.

1062
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,440
I knocked one over there.

1063
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,060
We need some better...

1064
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,900
We gotta kill our right, dude, I'm scared over here.

1065
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,700
I'm looking this way, just in case.

1066
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,600
No call, no call, no call.

1067
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,520
Wait, there's people fighting.

1068
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,140
I'm scanning for you, Averillo.

1069
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,420
Keep punching right, I'm playing with Mac.

1070
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,160
I'm anchoring here, I'm anchoring here.

1071
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,320
Track this guy, I'm pushing up.

1072
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,460
I'm looking right side for us.

1073
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,200
Track him, track him, Mac.

1074
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,080
Drunk, drunk, drunk.

1075
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,120
Someone call me, mate, or something.

1076
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,500
Under tree, under tree!

1077
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:48,640
Under tree, hello!

1078
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,400
Hold on, hold on.

1079
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,700
There's more, more, more.

1080
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,400
You guys got this.

1081
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,600
I'm just keeping our hill.

1082
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,540
Yeah, me too.

1083
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,560
I'm anchoring.

1084
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,860
They're putting walls down.

1085
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,900
I just don't, I don't have portal.

1086
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,820
If you do die, I don't have portal.

1087
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm moving into center.

1088
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,460
I crack one, I crack one, Mac in this bush.

1089
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,600
There's a team right here.

1090
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,320
I'm trying to get knaves.

1091
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,680
Wait, behind us, behind us!

1092
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,760
Wait, oh!

1093
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,000
They landed on very good.

1094
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,280
Way to kill us, way to kill us on me.

1095
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:12,980
Way to kill us on me.

1096
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,380
I got landed on.

1097
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,580
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

1098
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,860
Yeah, I'm down too.

1099
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,140
I didn't even hear it.

1100
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,260
We might be able to res here, Shurfar.

1101
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,540
Let me go down.

1102
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,060
I didn't even hear them land on us.

1103
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,220
Dude, go down more.

1104
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,620
Dude.

1105
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,520
Can you watch back above us?

1106
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,620
No.

1107
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,340
What the fuck am I watching?

1108
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,580
You are crazy.

1109
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:37,720
I didn't hold on.

1110
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,460
You can play behind the wall here.

1111
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,480
I'm gonna TP and Mac.

1112
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,520
He's not spam.

1113
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,240
I'm trying to get these guys killed.

1114
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,900
I'm getting fucking cards.

1115
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,020
I killed one.

1116
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:48,660
Oh my god.

1117
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,400
I got ran over.

1118
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,000
I got ran over.

1119
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,840
We got ran over.

1120
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,880
We abandoned our cars.

1121
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,140
We abandoned our cars.

1122
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,900
We put up stuffers.

1123
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,560
We put up stuffers.

1124
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,080
Chill, chill, chill, chill.

1125
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,380
They're fucked up on my side of zone, walking in here.

1126
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,960
If you play stuffers, you can kill them.

1127
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:02,840
I...

1128
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:03,860
I...

1129
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,760
Dude, he's trying to finish me.

1130
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,820
Bro, you hit him.

1131
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,580
Just hide your butt.

1132
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,740
You hit the shirt.

1133
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:08,960
You hit the shirt.

1134
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm getting cursed.

1135
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,040
No.

1136
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,920
You hit top four.

1137
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,520
It's fine.

1138
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,240
Dude, we both got ran over.

1139
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,800
Bro, I got...

1140
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,420
Aw.

1141
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,980
I got landed on.

1142
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,320
I was just about to TP and Mac and didn't get ran over there.

1143
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm so sad.

1144
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,700
I pushed into zone with the car and then Doki got killed.

1145
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,880
And then I had to res RPR.

1146
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,880
Wait, I didn't realize you left.

1147
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,160
We got a bunch of kills though, didn't we?

1148
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,860
Like six kills?

1149
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,380
Yeah, you guys did.

1150
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,280
We got a couple.

1151
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,860
You got six.

1152
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,360
I got three.

1153
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,760
I didn't even hear them.

1154
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:38,940
I got none.

1155
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,840
There's like no sound when they land on you.

1156
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,700
Oh, it's because they used the thing that Nobear is using right now.

1157
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,600
Oh, yeah.

1158
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:46,840
Okay.

1159
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,460
They used that and repositioned the knee because they thought that was by myself.

1160
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:51,880
Oh.

1161
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,460
I feel like if I TPed on you, Mac, earlier, we would have probably wiped out everything on the left there.

1162
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,880
Probably, yeah.

1163
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,800
Yeah, I mean, top four is pretty good.

1164
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,900
I should have probably just TPed and we just wiped the whole thing.

1165
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,400
I did 469 damage and not the one.

1166
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,220
Yeah, you can TP from like 200 meters away, by the way.

1167
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,880
Yeah, it's...

1168
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,980
Oh, that's crazy.

1169
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,340
I was thinking you'll just wipe that alone and then I'll play in the back.

1170
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
But then Doki got insta-kill.

1171
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,960
I feel like when Doki got insta-kill, I should just keep it on you instantly.

1172
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,680
23 damage.

1173
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,460
Let's go.

1174
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,220
Still, I mean, you had most kills on the arm.

1175
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,800
So, we were doing something, right?

1176
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,160
Made it?

1177
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,220
Wait, we're...

1178
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,460
Did it?

1179
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,140
Yeah, you had an MP, didn't you?

1180
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,200
Yeah, he had MVP.

1181
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:31,820
I had three kills.

1182
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,440
I think that's just for our team.

1183
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,320
I don't think that's like...

1184
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,900
I just for our team.

1185
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,640
Oh, that's...

1186
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,480
Yeah, that's just our team.

1187
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,980
Yeah, so we have six kills in gen- we have six kills in total.

1188
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,600
How should I express happiness?

1189
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,360
Did I get knocked out of the lobby?

1190
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,240
They're gonna remake the lobby.

1191
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:44,780
Oh, okay.

1192
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,840
I was gonna say, I was like, where's the lobby?

1193
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,740
Get my food real quick.

1194
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,160
We are back.

1195
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm gonna grab my phone charger.

1196
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,080
He's about to be slow.

1197
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,580
He's coming back with a full belly.

1198
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:53,840
Nice.

1199
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,080
Nice.

1200
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,360
It's not hitting anything, then.

1201
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Yeah, it's done.

1202
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,480
It's over.

1203
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,040
Oh, I hear this.

1204
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,520
Might as well go to bed, then.

1205
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,960
I feel like if they're gonna do that, I feel like we might as well just not anchor.

1206
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,500
How do they fly on you?

1207
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,700
I don't even know that.

1208
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,700
You have the flying...

1209
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,020
There's a girl that does the flying ability, and it's like a redeploy.

1210
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,140
Yeah.

1211
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,940
It's Valk, yeah.

1212
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,380
Yeah.

1213
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,400
I didn't hear that at all.

1214
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,340
You can't hear it.

1215
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,000
It doesn't have audio.

1216
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,900
It doesn't have audio.

1217
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,000
You just have to like watch for it.

1218
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,680
You have to like constantly be looking up and shit.

1219
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,040
Oh, so it's like...

1220
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,560
You can't leave me alone.

1221
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,880
So you constantly look up all the time, like...

1222
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,840
The thing is, I didn't look behind us, but I can't look up because of that.

1223
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,440
And then, I think like when Surefour left, like they saw me by myself and just landed on me.

1224
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,900
Yeah, I mean, you're smart from them.

1225
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,320
Yeah.

1226
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,440
That character is great.

1227
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,280
Maybe we should play that character.

1228
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,740
She's good.

1229
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,640
She just loses a ton of value late game.

1230
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,660
Like for like fighting, she's pretty useless.

1231
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,060
It takes a lot of time to put the ult, right?

1232
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,600
Yeah.

1233
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:01,280
So basically, it's a circle that she puts down and then you step in the circle and press space and you like just go flying.

1234
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,180
Oh.

1235
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,100
It's like double the height of a Valko.

1236
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,800
It's really high up, how high it sends you.

1237
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,340
But like, it's not that hard to shoot people out of it.

1238
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,240
Like it looks hard, but it's really easy to shoot people out of the air.

1239
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,760
Alright, so it's a different lobby, right?

1240
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,180
Yeah, we're just waiting for the car.

1241
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,020
Yeah, I wish I could see you get run over.

1242
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,680
Yeah, we both got run over.

1243
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,140
What's funny is he got run over and the same car run me over like a millisecond.

1244
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,860
Doing, doing.

1245
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,180
Wait, where was your car?

1246
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,420
I thought you had a car, Shurfur.

1247
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,960
What happened?

1248
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,660
Oh, I had to drop it down.

1249
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,740
They took it down.

1250
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,740
To pick up RPR?

1251
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,720
Pretty sure they took our car and ran us over their own car.

1252
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,360
I think so.

1253
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,700
Wait, are you sure?

1254
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,280
Because I think they took one of our armor cars when they landed on me.

1255
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:56,720
Nah.

1256
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,720
That's fucked up.

1257
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
That's really fucked up.

1258
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,040
The skills humans are born with seem more challenging.

1259
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,580
Yeah.

1260
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,600
Can't believe we just do that.

1261
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,680
Maybe we should always move as four.

1262
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,900
I think so too.

1263
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,980
I think it's because the TTK is so fast.

1264
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,760
Or we should always look up, man.

1265
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,280
I think at endgame, we should look up.

1266
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,760
Like, someone has to be...

1267
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,320
On endgame, someone has to look up.

1268
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,880
Just in case.

1269
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,020
You just have to pay attention to who has to move around you.

1270
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,480
Because you'll see them ulting.

1271
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,000
Like, it's a really big fucking, like, indicator.

1272
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:27,580
Really?

1273
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,140
If you just know who to watch.

1274
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,720
Yeah, it's a huge, like, very, very visible indicator.

1275
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,840
Okay, maybe you should be the one to look then.

1276
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,180
I can't.

1277
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,800
My character, I can't do that.

1278
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,280
I have to play like a psycho.

1279
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,780
Because I'm the only one who can frontline.

1280
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,240
Everyone just remember to look up every few seconds.

1281
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Just, like, give a look.

1282
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,360
Just always look up.

1283
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,700
If you're anchoring, like, all you gotta do is look behind and look up.

1284
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,720
But what if I wanna...

1285
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,100
No, just pay attention to who has to move.

1286
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,040
You'll see it.

1287
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:58,860
Okay.

1288
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,140
Yeah.

1289
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,440
I should've said the team across wasn't in.

1290
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,860
It was definitely the team across that just, like, Val culted on you.

1291
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,340
Oh, I see.

1292
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,680
Oh, yeah.

1293
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:09,920
Yeah.

1294
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,800
Val culted to go across the map because they didn't have a floaty car.

1295
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,580
Yeah.

1296
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,020
And I moved up to get into...

1297
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,960
Every single part of me is replaced.

1298
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,200
Wait, you didn't...

1299
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,660
Oh, my gosh.

1300
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,360
If...

1301
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,860
Why didn't you wait for me to get in the car?

1302
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,860
I should've just pushed to the map.

1303
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,380
You were out of course.

1304
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,680
When Mac crossed, I should've just ulted on him instantly.

1305
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,600
And then we just wiped the entire left side there.

1306
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,380
So then even if you guys died, we still...

1307
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,060
Yeah, they were resetting on the left too.

1308
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,180
Yeah.

1309
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,880
But, like, as I was about to, like, commit to, like, go try and kill them, I got...

1310
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,900
I started getting shot in the back by the guys that were shooting you.

1311
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,000
So I had to, like, pause and throw smokes and heal and let them reset.

1312
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,960
Uh...

1313
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,980
You had two cars, actually.

1314
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,260
Where's the lobby?

1315
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,600
Waiting.

1316
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,540
Oh, yeah.

1317
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,060
Where did our lobby go?

1318
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,080
Waitings, waitings.

1319
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,380
How may I assist?

1320
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,180
Alright.

1321
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:11,800
Sorry.

1322
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,920
I forgot to...

1323
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,000
Mute my...

1324
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,680
To do the...

1325
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,260
Sorry, my mind's fried.

1326
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,560
I don't even know how to kill.

1327
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,560
I don't even get a lot of points.

1328
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,940
I forgot to do the hotkey for mute.

1329
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,080
So I have to tab out every time to mute, guys.

1330
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,240
Yeah.

1331
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:27,780
Yeah.

1332
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,960
This is fake trigger.

1333
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:29,860
I see...

1334
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,040
From, like, the first set, teams are dropping, like, 30 possible games.

1335
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,040
And I don't think...

1336
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,120
You wish this the game right now.

1337
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,880
Or watch the stream to get keys.

1338
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,260
Or they're just killing hell of people, but...

1339
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,020
I don't think that was possible.

1340
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,360
There was a scoring system somewhere, wasn't there?

1341
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,060
Are you enjoying yourself?

1342
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,680
I'm having fun.

1343
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,040
This is a fun team.

1344
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,000
We get 17 points.

1345
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,540
It's very tryhard, though.

1346
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,140
I think...

1347
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,220
Apparently, our team's the only team that's sponsored to be.

1348
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,680
So we should get 23 points for the game.

1349
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,020
So, like, the rest of the teams here...

1350
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,420
First place gets 25 points, better.

1351
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,020
...signed up.

1352
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,740
So they're, like, extra tryhard.

1353
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,580
So it's heavily placement, basically.

1354
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,300
And then we're, like...

1355
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,620
We're, like...

1356
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,240
We're chill, but also try...

1357
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,380
Tryhard.

1358
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:05,780
Yeah.

1359
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,720
But, um...

1360
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:09,980
But, yeah.

1361
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,680
This is a very, very sweaty lobby.

1362
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,160
Apparently...

1363
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,880
Yeah, um...

1364
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,960
Bro, I'm not kidding.

1365
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,580
No name.

1366
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,280
No nothing.

1367
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,200
Dude, he didn't just try and gun you down.

1368
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,280
We told him...

1369
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,140
Bro, I destroyed you.

1370
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,080
...that that's your teammate.

1371
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,300
And he still kept...

1372
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,900
Yeah, yeah.

1373
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,760
That's true.

1374
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,640
That's true.

1375
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,320
That's true.

1376
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,160
That's me.

1377
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:26,660
Nah, nah.

1378
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,180
I cannot hear you guys.

1379
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,040
I was locked in.

1380
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,700
I was locked in.

1381
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,820
I wonder why he was out of ammo.

1382
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:32,900
No.

1383
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,320
Yeah, but I looted the box and I was full ammo again.

1384
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:35,880
What do you mean about...

1385
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:36,780
Hmm.

1386
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,060
Okay, but, like...

1387
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,100
I'm ironically, like...

1388
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,860
I was locked in.

1389
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,020
I thought that guy was about to run me over.

1390
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,640
No name.

1391
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,220
No nothing.

1392
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,440
I'm shooting, dude.

1393
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,240
I'm shooting, dude.

1394
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,020
Like, what do you want from me?

1395
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,580
I'm locked in.

1396
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,600
Like, a mile away.

1397
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,640
It's a bug, probably, or something.

1398
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,140
I don't know.

1399
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,370
Listen, man.

1400
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,910
I was just locked in.

1401
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,310
Will I still be Camille?

1402
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,990
I was just locked in, dude.

1403
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,590
Maybe it's because I was ADS.

1404
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,850
He couldn't see the name.

1405
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,510
But he was just missing everything.

1406
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,870
So, I'm saying is if Mac was an enemy, he's dead like three times there, dude.

1407
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,310
I'm locked.

1408
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,430
Sure, he was.

1409
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,850
I'm not letting anyone go up to us.

1410
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:17,650
I wonder...

1411
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,070
Wait, is there friendly fire on your team's car?

1412
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,090
Yeah.

1413
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,190
Yeah, he fucked my car up.

1414
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,610
Wait, you fucked my car up.

1415
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,750
You fucked me up, bro.

1416
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,510
Fuck that shit up.

1417
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,130
I was locked in, dude.

1418
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,930
Blew my windshields out.

1419
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,150
Maybe that's why we lost.

1420
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,270
Maybe that's why we lost.

1421
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:36,530
Yeah, okay.

1422
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,250
That's why we lost.

1423
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,830
Not because you got landed on by four people.

1424
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,730
Yeah, and who left me alone!

1425
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,630
Nobody told me to get over to you guys.

1426
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,810
Because that wasn't the plan.

1427
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,090
Well, that was a bad plan, leaving me to anchor.

1428
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,190
Oh, Mac made it.

1429
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,110
Yell at him, not me.

1430
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,150
It's my bad, I trust the turkey.

1431
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,150
What?

1432
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:11,290
Oh, he just made a 1v4, an entire team, as the non-mobile character.

1433
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:12,790
I believe it.

1434
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:17,130
As no TV whatsoever, other than for you guys to TV to me.

1435
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,970
He's like, let's split up, gang!

1436
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,690
Thought you were built like that.

1437
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,550
How long do we have to wait for next lobby?

1438
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,210
What's going on?

1439
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,690
I have no idea.

1440
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:35,950
What's the word?

1441
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,170
Getting all the points and stuff.

1442
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,010
Oh, that's true.

1443
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,730
Yeah, I said getting the scores up.

1444
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,030
But I have to manually score it.

1445
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,450
Yeah, you have to count everything.

1446
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,350
Oh, apparently the...

1447
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:52,350
Can I pee?

1448
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,010
I think we're on... Wait, what's your ping for that server?

1449
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,050
You don't see it.

1450
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,010
It just says latency.

1451
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,330
It doesn't say like...

1452
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,670
It just says the word latency.

1453
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,310
I'm just wondering if it's East Coast or West Coast.

1454
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,530
Because the Korean team was saying how it was difficult to play.

1455
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,050
Maybe I can't see ping.

1456
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,170
Maybe it's like you enable it somewhere.

1457
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,250
Let me see.

1458
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,890
A network monitoring display.

1459
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,230
Okay, I guess this stuff.

1460
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,610
I'll see you next game.

1461
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,310
But it wasn't bad.

1462
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,130
I mean, it was laggy obviously, but it wasn't like...

1463
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:29,130
Yeah.

1464
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:29,730
Horrible for me.

1465
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,370
Oh my god, I just queued a game.

1466
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,810
Sorry, just leave the game.

1467
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,450
It's quick play.

1468
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,870
No, no, no, it like cancelled.

1469
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,070
Oh, they made the lobby.

1470
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,150
Okay, I'll hide my screen this time so I don't leak the fucking password.

1471
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,810
Yeah, I'll be great then.

1472
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,770
The only single part of me is...

1473
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,010
I... No.

1474
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,310
I don't think so.

1475
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,890
I think that's why the three make the lobby.

1476
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,850
Because somebody...

1477
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,370
Not us, of course.

1478
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,250
I'm going to pee.

1479
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:54,970
Nah.

1480
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,670
Not us.

1481
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,090
They're back.

1482
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,390
Someone did the thing.

1483
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,310
Who could it be?

1484
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,850
RPR.

1485
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,710
You're right.

1486
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:04,730
It's RPR's fault.

1487
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:06,730
100%.

1488
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,170
Yeah.

1489
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,510
Just like how he let me die there.

1490
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:10,730
Yeah.

1491
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:11,290
Yeah.

1492
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,970
But even if it's RPR's fault, I'm still going to blame Doki.

1493
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:14,850
Wait, what?

1494
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,550
What did I do?

1495
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,490
I'm literally the support.

1496
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,810
Someone's not getting healed today.

1497
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,830
So...

1498
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,450
I'll take the heals, don't worry.

1499
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,590
Yeah, never blame the support.

1500
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,230
I can hold people hostage.

1501
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,270
A TP and the heals.

1502
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,410
That's right.

1503
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,370
I saved lives.

1504
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,960
I wonder what points do we get.

1505
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,380
23.

1506
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,460
In total?

1507
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,680
Yeah, that game should be 23.

1508
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,620
17 from placement, we had 6 kills.

1509
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,160
Whoa!

1510
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,840
That could hit us at top 5.

1511
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,900
Well, we'll never know.

1512
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,600
Chat, what placement are we at?

1513
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,460
At chat.

1514
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,180
This is your time to shine.

1515
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,800
No Elp.

1516
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,500
Guys, I just want to know what placements we got.

1517
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,320
No Elp.

1518
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,000
No Elp.

1519
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,440
No Elp.

1520
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,880
What you crunching on?

1521
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,580
Yeah, what you eating?

1522
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,440
What did you get for lunch?

1523
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,480
Or dinner?

1524
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,240
Oh, wait.

1525
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,060
That sounds good.

1526
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,680
Mm-hmm.

1527
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,540
You're going to get EP?

1528
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,400
No.

1529
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,200
You're going to get EP while on a full stomach?

1530
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,020
I don't get food comas.

1531
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:47,960
I don't get food comas.

1532
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,680
Man.

1533
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,340
You probably don't eat too much.

1534
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,780
No, I'm fat.

1535
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,560
I do eat a lot.

1536
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,860
What the fuck?

1537
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,500
The food com only happens when you eat a ton.

1538
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,380
Remember when he said he's built...

1539
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,660
He's the perfect being, remember?

1540
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,020
I forgot about that one.

1541
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm the perfect human.

1542
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,460
Yeah, he's the perfect human.

1543
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,780
He's literally built different.

1544
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,660
I got a big belly.

1545
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,820
I got a big belly.

1546
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,400
Thank you so much for slapping it for us.

1547
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,960
I really knew that.

1548
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,920
I wouldn't have been able to tell how big of a belly it was.

1549
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,920
Jesus Christ, man.

1550
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,340
He's trying...

1551
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,100
He's proving his point.

1552
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,080
I got a fat ass too.

1553
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,240
Yeah, slap it.

1554
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,700
Do some jumping jacks.

1555
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,860
Stap against TOS.

1556
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,560
How would they know?

1557
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,520
How would they know?

1558
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,420
Your cab's not up.

1559
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,040
They don't know.

1560
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,780
It's the...

1561
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,640
What's the word?

1562
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,660
You said it?

1563
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,020
Yeah.

1564
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,640
Now it's like...

1565
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,160
They know.

1566
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,640
Implied.

1567
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,280
Implied?

1568
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,220
Just slap your ass and say it's your belly.

1569
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,700
You can't even English.

1570
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,580
Slap your ass and say it's just your belly.

1571
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,240
I know English had a second language level.

1572
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,120
What's your first language level?

1573
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,560
English.

1574
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:03,680
Yes, yes.

1575
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,920
I thought he was going to say French.

1576
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,840
If he was French Canadian, don't be GG.

1577
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,400
I don't think he's...

1578
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,200
Yeah, I don't think he's French.

1579
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,820
I don't know, bro.

1580
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,720
French Canadians?

1581
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,880
I'm from the Texas of Canada.

1582
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:15,820
Wait.

1583
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,280
Alberta.

1584
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,740
Yeah, I was going to say it was Alberta.

1585
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,220
Yeah.

1586
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,100
Mm-hmm.

1587
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,020
We got oil.

1588
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,480
Yeah.

1589
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,980
Shit's valid, dude.

1590
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:28,400
Yeah.

1591
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:29,500
Yeah.

1592
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,480
Dash, Texas, Canada for you.

1593
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,480
You gotta oil.

1594
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,060
What are we waiting for?

1595
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,820
We're waiting for one person.

1596
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,720
Can this one person hurry the fuck up?

1597
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,020
Yeah.

1598
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,020
Add person.

1599
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:42,760
Where are you?

1600
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,900
Chat, what placements are we?

1601
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,200
Anyone figure it out?

1602
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,360
No one figured it out.

1603
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:48,660
They posted it.

1604
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,040
We're third right now.

1605
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,600
Oh, we're third?

1606
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,020
Ooh!

1607
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,780
First is effects team, 36 points.

1608
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,160
Second team, 34.

1609
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:56,720
Whoa!

1610
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,740
And then us with 23.

1611
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,500
Hey, that's pretty...

1612
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,680
So wait, effects team won with three kills.

1613
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,040
Placements.

1614
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,580
They're 36.

1615
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,860
Placements 25.

1616
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,660
They won with 11.

1617
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,020
Oh, 8 kills.

1618
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:07,480
No, wait.

1619
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:07,820
Hold on.

1620
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,400
11 kills?

1621
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,660
Holy shit, that's a lot of kills.

1622
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,160
Wait.

1623
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,820
Does it count if you...

1624
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,160
Does it count if you kill...

1625
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,160
Like, if they respawn and then you kill them again?

1626
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,540
Does that count as an extra kill?

1627
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:17,960
Yeah.

1628
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,800
Oh, they might have just been respawn farming then.

1629
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,580
Oh, that's a strat.

1630
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,540
I saw people doing that in the first group A tournament.

1631
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,940
They were literally respawn farming.

1632
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,840
That's fucking toxic.

1633
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,820
You're in a custom lobby tournament getting respawn farming.

1634
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:32,900
Yeah.

1635
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,780
Yeah, I saw...

1636
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,380
I literally was like watching...

1637
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:35,920
I think it was...

1638
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,480
I think it was Frex's team.

1639
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,820
Yeah, it was Frex's team.

1640
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,480
And like, they killed a weaker team and they were just patrolling the respawns.

1641
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,820
And trying to find them.

1642
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,300
I was like...

1643
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,320
I was like...

1644
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,060
Damn, that's fucked up.

1645
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,880
I was like...

1646
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,280
I thought you meant they were running up crafting with the fucking...

1647
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,460
Yeah, like they were like...

1648
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:51,680
The gem thing.

1649
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,680
I think the team were like...

1650
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,760
Was like Genshin players.

1651
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,220
I was like...

1652
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,180
Damn, that's fucked up.

1653
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:01,680
Oh, man.

1654
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,980
I was like...

1655
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,160
I was like...

1656
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,700
How much would it be for your team to do that?

1657
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,540
Start gifting subs.

1658
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,320
Let's get going.

1659
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,880
Gifts subs and we'll also respawn farm.

1660
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,640
Yeah, Shepard does it for the pleasure of it.

1661
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,960
Yeah, but you're just an asshole, dude.

1662
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,420
I'll do it for free.

1663
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,780
Do we have Genshin players in this hobby or are there?

1664
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,780
Tell us which was the Genshin team.

1665
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,640
We'll run at them.

1666
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,000
Come on, chat.

1667
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,340
Wrap them up to us.

1668
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,280
Any Genshin...

1669
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,000
Wait, hold on, hold on.

1670
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,820
Any Genshin players in here?

1671
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,940
Nah, I can't write them.

1672
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,600
They don't have to be too bad at them.

1673
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:00,640
Yeah.

1674
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,280
They've got the lobby chat.

1675
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,320
Just like, kitchen players?

1676
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,040
Where you guys landed?

1677
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,800
Where you landed?

1678
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:07,620
Yeah.

1679
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,600
We just wanted to know, you know, we're here to stay far away from you guys.

1680
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:19,620
Yeah.

1681
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,520
He's trying to stay away because you guys are like veterans in the gacha space.

1682
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,600
Yeah.

1683
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,140
Yeah.

1684
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,560
That's what it is.

1685
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,020
And we just wanted you to...

1686
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,380
So we're just trying to make sure you'll stay alive a little longer.

1687
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,340
Nothing else.

1688
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,560
We'll be your personal bodyguards.

1689
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,000
If you see our cards.

1690
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,240
Yeah.

1691
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,700
If you see our cards, don't shoot.

1692
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:44,980
We just hear the...

1693
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,760
We're protecting you.

1694
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:45,980
Yeah.

1695
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,280
We're just here to protect you.

1696
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,520
Oh my God.

1697
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,460
Some of my chat was like, oh, just say anyone hit any sick pulls recently?

1698
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,020
I did get a sick pull yesterday.

1699
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,440
Oh yeah.

1700
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:02,980
What did you get?

1701
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:04,980
What's her name?

1702
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,200
I'm looking into this.

1703
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:06,960
What game?

1704
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,980
I got Lilium in a 20 pull.

1705
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,480
What game is that?

1706
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,100
Ethereo restart.

1707
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,560
The fuck?

1708
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,780
I was going to say, the fuck is that?

1709
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,300
He's playing the indie gachas.

1710
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:19,800
Yeah.

1711
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:20,980
He is deep.

1712
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,240
It's new.

1713
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,320
It's Epic Seven.

1714
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,760
Wait, how much did you spend?

1715
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,340
I don't know.

1716
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,780
That 20 pull was free pulls.

1717
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,480
Oh.

1718
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,440
Maybe it could be set pulls though.

1719
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,880
Well, to pity it, you need 180.

1720
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,760
No, but there's like some games where if you get free pulls, it's just like set pulls.

1721
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,280
Uh-huh.

1722
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:44,180
Huh.

1723
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,360
Like...

1724
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,620
Wait, did you just start and got the free 20?

1725
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,280
Or...

1726
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,060
Or was it like you built it up?

1727
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,420
Well, because like the...

1728
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,580
The horse game is...

1729
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:52,740
It just started.

1730
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,460
The horse game gives you like a default pull.

1731
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,680
Like it's a set pull.

1732
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,480
What?

1733
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:58,840
Um...

1734
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,200
Like when you do a free pull.

1735
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:00,540
Are you talking about pity?

1736
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,240
Yeah, the gotcha game.

1737
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,160
The horse game.

1738
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,020
Are you talking about pity?

1739
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,100
No, I'm not.

1740
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,280
I'm talking about like when you play...

1741
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,580
When they do the tutorial thing.

1742
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,860
You're like, here's like some free rolls for you.

1743
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,480
And then it gives you like a...

1744
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,760
Uh...

1745
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,340
Like a set pull.

1746
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,780
I've been playing this game for like three months.

1747
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:17,240
Oh!

1748
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:17,560
What?

1749
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,060
I said it.

1750
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,380
Did you just play it?

1751
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,260
As in like...

1752
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:21,640
Just started.

1753
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,240
Yeah, yesterday.

1754
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,620
I don't remember this.

1755
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,780
I'm being gaslit I think.

1756
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,550
Why are we not starting?

1757
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:44,970
Everybody's here.

1758
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:46,270
Sitting.

1759
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:47,230
Waiting.

1760
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:48,350
Where are they?

1761
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,570
Where are they?

1762
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:51,610
Where are they?

1763
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:53,410
Where are they?

1764
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,010
Did you start game?

1765
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,810
Did they swap players?

1766
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:56,790
Wait, where?

1767
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,190
They might have shuffled some teams.

1768
00:48:59,310 --> 00:48:59,590
Team 10?

1769
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,390
Wait, did they shuffle teams because people were too...

1770
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:03,750
Too try hard?

1771
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,230
I think one person couldn't like connect or something.

1772
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,970
Oh, I was gonna say.

1773
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:09,870
Like what?

1774
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,190
How did they...

1775
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,910
What do you mean they swap players?

1776
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,270
I know like the confirmed teams are different.

1777
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,750
Than like what's on the list.

1778
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,670
My bedtime soon.

1779
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:24,570
Alright?

1780
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:25,490
Let's get going.

1781
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,230
It's a Saturday.

1782
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:28,410
You have bedtime on a Saturday?

1783
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:29,610
No, like Asia.

1784
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,910
Cause it's like...

1785
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:32,990
What?

1786
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:34,910
Oh wait, no.

1787
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:35,750
It's 8 a.m.

1788
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,570
right now in Japan.

1789
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:37,630
Yeah, it's 8 a.m.

1790
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:38,110
Or EU.

1791
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,030
Should be morning.

1792
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:39,730
Wait, no.

1793
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:40,250
It's EU.

1794
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:41,730
EU bedtime.

1795
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,330
Yeah.

1796
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:43,830
It's 1 a.m.

1797
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:44,150
from Europe.

1798
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:44,530
Yeah.

1799
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,530
I mean, max bedtime is like...

1800
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:47,890
That's not bedtime.

1801
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,370
It's like 6.

1802
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:54,230
Yeah, max bedtime is like 10 or 11 p.m.

1803
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:55,650
He's an old man.

1804
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:56,330
No.

1805
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:56,390
No.

1806
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,950
That's not what I told.

1807
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:58,750
No.

1808
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,010
I told her that I'd be on till 1 or 2.

1809
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:01,650
No, no.

1810
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,770
You said you go to bed at 10 or 11.

1811
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:05,690
And I cooked my schedule now.

1812
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:06,710
Well, you cooked my schedule.

1813
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,470
I cooked your schedule?

1814
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:09,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

1815
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,410
I'm helping you get paid.

1816
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,970
I got a sponsor opportunity.

1817
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,790
I won't hit you up.

1818
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,350
I won't hit you up.

1819
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,890
I won't hit you up the next time I got a sponsor opportunity.

1820
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,030
No, no, no.

1821
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,370
Stop being too hasty.

1822
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:31,910
Boss?

1823
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,730
3, 2, 1.

1824
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,430
Yeah, I was good for like 2 weeks.

1825
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,010
I was like, man, this is a great schedule.

1826
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:39,770
Someone left.

1827
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:40,590
Again?

1828
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,270
Yesterday I woke up at 6.

1829
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:45,360
Maybe if you spam chat you get ticked.

1830
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:47,550
Server number 1.

1831
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,390
Oh, should we start things?

1832
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:51,890
Wait, we have the number 1 Camille player in the server?

1833
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,070
Taxi's not here.

1834
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:58,590
There's a tag that's like number 1 Camille player.

1835
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:03,800
Yay.

1836
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,200
I'm a rare breed to Europe.

1837
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,960
How are you rare?

1838
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,860
You know, one time in my chat, one guy came in and he asked me what breed of Europe.

1839
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,280
I was.

1840
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,300
Oh yeah.

1841
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,300
I remember.

1842
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,900
I fucking banned his ass.

1843
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,260
What do you mean?

1844
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,300
I'm a fucking dog, dude.

1845
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,800
You didn't even answer him?

1846
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,500
No.

1847
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,240
Fucker.

1848
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,300
He doesn't deserve to know.

1849
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,080
I don't know.

1850
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,640
You did crouch in front of me when you wanted those dollars.

1851
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,040
Oh, true.

1852
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,820
It's the classic...

1853
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,400
Bro, whatever, bro.

1854
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,300
I'm not even going to justify that.

1855
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,400
Bark, bark.

1856
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:44,720
You know what?

1857
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:44,740
I know.

1858
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:44,760
I know.

1859
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:45,860
I know.

1860
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,850
I know.

1861
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,500
I know.

1862
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,420
Didn't you have a toggle where you were a dog man?

1863
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,200
Who?

1864
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:55,760
You.

1865
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,780
Okay.

1866
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,140
Huh?

1867
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,700
What are you talking about?

1868
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,560
Now he's lying.

1869
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,800
Let's go.

1870
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,320
Agriculture.

1871
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:02,780
Agriculture.

1872
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:03,540
I want to farm.

1873
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,360
I gave it to Mac.

1874
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,210
We're gonna go on this TP.

1875
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:12,590
Oh.

1876
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:13,930
And where's that?

1877
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:14,430
Yeah.

1878
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:14,630
Where does it go?

1879
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,530
I was like, where does it go?

1880
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:16,130
Yeah.

1881
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,590
We're just going to go to the observatory again.

1882
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,010
Okay.

1883
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,790
All the small things.

1884
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:23,590
All the small things.

1885
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,030
All the small things.

1886
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,610
I think there's a team in this TP though, but I think it should be okay.

1887
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:31,530
Are you sure?

1888
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:33,970
I'm not really sure.

1889
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:34,930
I've never taken this before.

1890
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:35,630
Are you sure?

1891
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,030
SPANG!

1892
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,530
Wait, we're going to observatory?

1893
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:39,730
Yeah, we're on this one.

1894
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:43,970
I'm detaching because my guy looks weird flying leave with you.

1895
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,510
Oh my god, you are lagging on my screen.

1896
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,710
Yeah, I have to fly alone because it just looks weird.

1897
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,330
The other team is going over here on my red bike.

1898
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,650
I went the wrong way.

1899
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,790
Oh, I'm fine.

1900
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:58,290
Okay.

1901
00:52:59,010 --> 00:52:59,590
It should be fine.

1902
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,190
Yeah, you'll be fine.

1903
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,550
If you don't die, then you're alive.

1904
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:03,870
And if you die, you're dead.

1905
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,870
I have another respawn if we die.

1906
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,030
I mean, I'm just spitting right now.

1907
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:10,390
Type shit.

1908
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,450
Type's the S word.

1909
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:15,110
Nice.

1910
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,850
I literally just teleported.

1911
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,370
Oh my gosh, this house had like three different armors.

1912
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:20,690
Bloodyator.

1913
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,770
That I didn't pick up, apparently.

1914
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,990
I pinged the blue here.

1915
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,440
Blue armor.

1916
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,440
I'll take that.

1917
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,660
I think the ping should be a bit bigger, though.

1918
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,460
100%.

1919
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,920
It's so hard to see where you guys are pinging stuff.

1920
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,560
That's because you're blind.

1921
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,660
No, I'm not.

1922
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,280
I mean, I do wear glasses, but no, I'm not.

1923
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:48,580
Shit.

1924
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,740
Leaked?

1925
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:53,780
Doxxed?

1926
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:55,880
How?

1927
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,120
What do you mean to you here?

1928
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:57,580
How the fuck?

1929
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,420
How?

1930
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,220
That's just how the fuck then.

1931
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,440
I need it.

1932
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,220
Blue back right here.

1933
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,260
Oh, no.

1934
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,820
I need better guns.

1935
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,280
Guys, I need something that's not white armor.

1936
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,360
W moment.

1937
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,460
There's another blue armor here for you guys.

1938
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,660
W moment.

1939
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,960
I haven't seen a guardian yet.

1940
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,980
I need a scoping tin.

1941
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,280
I need like a... There's another blue armor.

1942
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,460
There's a beast pasta.

1943
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,380
There's a 2x.

1944
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:33,600
There's a 2x.

1945
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,520
I've got a 2x for you.

1946
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,260
There's so many blue armors, guys.

1947
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,140
I need a scope from a gladiator.

1948
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,340
I'm looking for a Cantio, sir, gladiator.

1949
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,120
I don't have either.

1950
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,060
I have a red dot right now, but I would like any scope.

1951
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,280
Yo, here's blue armor.

1952
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,960
I pinged like four blue armors.

1953
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,580
I want, I want, I want.

1954
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:54,700
Reloading.

1955
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,720
Where'd you ping the 3x?

1956
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:58,820
Blue armor here.

1957
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:58,960
Fire?

1958
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,600
On my balcony over here.

1959
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,340
I'm in the MAC right now.

1960
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,920
I'm gonna go to this house.

1961
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,020
Oh, okay.

1962
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,540
There's a, there's a armor car in front of us here.

1963
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,320
Like, uh, that we can use.

1964
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,060
Not that there's anybody there.

1965
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,420
Uh, big.

1966
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,360
I'm kind of used.

1967
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,500
You're used?

1968
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,020
I'm kind of used.

1969
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,340
Used.

1970
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,760
Man, used.

1971
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,760
Like Swedish for juiced.

1972
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,740
Whatever you do in your free time is up to you.

1973
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,980
Yeah, we won't judge.

1974
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,540
You guys have your mind is in the gutter dude.

1975
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:39,540
This is self-report.

1976
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,460
You literally said, you're used.

1977
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,140
Self-report, self-report.

1978
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,980
I said I'm used.

1979
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,040
Yeah, you're used.

1980
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,060
Yeah, you said that again.

1981
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:47,700
Yeah, you said it again.

1982
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,760
That means juiced in Swedish.

1983
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:49,320
You're used.

1984
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,900
I think this guy's lying.

1985
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,900
Yeah, I think he's, I think he's gaslighting us.

1986
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,220
Swedish English, you guys need to...

1987
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,620
God, American kids eat hot cheetos and wine.

1988
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,660
Yeah, all they do is lie.

1989
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,940
We don't even have hot cheetos here, man.

1990
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,160
That's American shit.

1991
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,400
That's why you're lying all the time.

1992
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,100
All they do is lie and slur.

1993
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,360
I'm about to leave you guys behind.

1994
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,660
That would be the first time.

1995
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,640
Oh, typical URP is leaving us.

1996
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,980
Yeah, we just go back up.

1997
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,020
Beep, beep, I'm going to source energy labs.

1998
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:20,980
I've been abandoned.

1999
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,980
Wait, I'm gonna be abandoned too.

2000
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,620
I've been punished for the sins of my teammates.

2001
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,320
Wait, no, RP are abandoned all of us.

2002
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,840
Do I have to pick you guys up for real?

2003
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,700
No, I got sure for sure for it.

2004
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,440
Pick me up.

2005
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,180
That's okay, sure for it.

2006
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,340
Bro, you used me.

2007
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,560
You almost dragged past me.

2008
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,400
I was trying to just push you.

2009
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,180
You want this car?

2010
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,800
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

2011
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:45,960
Yeah.

2012
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,160
There could be someone here because of the...

2013
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,520
I just noticed this is TP route.

2014
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,180
Yeah.

2015
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:57,960
Let's respawn farm them.

2016
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,300
I'm so fucking down.

2017
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,200
Okay, but what if they're good though?

2018
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,200
Let's respawn farm them.

2019
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,420
We're better.

2020
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,700
Okay, okay.

2021
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,200
I believe.

2022
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,120
I'm believing less because Shurford is trying the front line.

2023
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,020
Yeah, Shurford was really sure about it.

2024
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,120
We're better.

2025
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,200
There.

2026
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,820
Deadly and beautiful.

2027
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,440
Yo dude look.

2028
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,840
My house, my house.

2029
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,400
The only sick mortgage.

2030
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,360
The sick hasn't revealed anything.

2031
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,080
The stores open.

2032
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:30,560
Oh.

2033
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,560
Up here I climbed my earth.

2034
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:38,160
Yeah, yeah, I fucking... I... I car bounced off your car, that shit was a loot.

2035
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,360
Wait, why are we here again?

2036
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:41,700
Looting.

2037
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,220
Looting.

2038
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:42,280
Looting.

2039
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:42,760
Oh.

2040
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,900
And armor and stuff.

2041
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,680
Did anyone find a DMR Cantius?

2042
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:49,860
Three times.

2043
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,960
And you Cantius.

2044
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,380
Three times, three times, three times zooming scope.

2045
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,680
No Cantius around me.

2046
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,540
Time to put our plans in.

2047
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,380
I'm dropping a purple mag for Cantius here.

2048
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,920
I dropped it three times.

2049
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:05,980
I'll take that.

2050
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,920
I don't have any smokes, man.

2051
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,140
I need mollies.

2052
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:12,540
Molly.

2053
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:13,720
Molly.

2054
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:16,960
Molly.

2055
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:18,380
Molly.

2056
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,780
Open up the sky.

2057
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,320
Oh, purple back back here.

2058
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,800
Has anyone found a extra Cantius?

2059
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,660
Cantius, Cantius here.

2060
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,520
No.

2061
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,140
No.

2062
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:32,760
Where?

2063
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,740
I pinged it on the bottom of the... facility.

2064
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:37,640
Oh.

2065
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,900
We have it down here.

2066
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:39,300
Yay!

2067
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,260
There's a Cantius right here.

2068
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,760
I don't have any... I don't have any big medkits.

2069
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,440
Ooh, gold hammer.

2070
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,320
Wait, there's a bottom?

2071
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,660
There's a sniper extended mag.

2072
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:49,620
And a...

2073
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,380
Where the fuck is... Oh, there it is.

2074
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,280
What?

2075
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:52,920
What?

2076
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:53,900
What?

2077
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:53,960
What?

2078
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,620
That.

2079
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:55,840
Yeah.

2080
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,440
The bottom has all the good bullshit.

2081
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,640
I'm collecting money.

2082
00:58:59,640 --> 00:58:59,740
Yeah, the bottom has all the good shit.

2083
00:58:59,740 --> 00:58:59,740
I'm collecting money.

2084
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,980
Yeah, and the roof as well is good shit.

2085
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,240
Weee.

2086
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,040
Look, look.

2087
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,360
The roof has gold armor.

2088
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,780
Oh my god.

2089
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,780
That's a lot of good shit right there.

2090
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,600
Yeah, good stuff for Balvin, good stuff for Balvin.

2091
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,200
And there's gas.

2092
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,000
I got gas in case we run out of it.

2093
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,820
I need to... have I seriously not seen any smoke nades?

2094
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,120
What?

2095
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,520
I don't think I have.

2096
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:24,860
Nope.

2097
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,260
I'm gonna go for upgrades.

2098
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,780
I found random regular grenades.

2099
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,000
Have fun.

2100
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,240
Zone's coming, by the way.

2101
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,760
Oh, I found smoke grenades.

2102
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,360
YOOOP!

2103
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:34,860
Where's the car?

2104
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,220
Shut the fuck up.

2105
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:41,980
Let's go for upgrades.

2106
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,340
Ah, it hurts, it hurts.

2107
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,520
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

2108
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,020
Guys, you gotta go left for upgrades.

2109
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,520
Wait, where did you leave the car?

2110
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:48,900
Okay.

2111
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,200
I don't know.

2112
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,740
I just looked for the car on the map.

2113
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,500
Yeah, just car items.

2114
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:55,260
Yeah.

2115
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:58,640
Upgrade time.

2116
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,300
Wait, I don't have enough upgrades.

2117
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,080
Actually, do I?

2118
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,580
I only have 50.

2119
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,040
Do you have money?

2120
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,580
Wait, actually, I think I do have 50.

2121
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:06,800
I do.

2122
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,100
I got horrible upgrades.

2123
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,460
I'm gonna get the, I have, I'm gonna get the helmet.

2124
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,800
I got a skull piercer.

2125
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,760
I out regen the zone with the perk that I got.

2126
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,280
What the?

2127
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,620
Oh, I got the quick, ah, quick ult's fine.

2128
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,240
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2129
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,280
Beep, beep.

2130
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,400
Beep, beep.

2131
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,480
Beep, beep.

2132
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,700
Everyone leave me?

2133
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:34,220
Yeah.

2134
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:34,880
Ya.

2135
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:34,900
Hmm.

2136
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:35,680
Not everyone.

2137
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,480
Ya, Max it real wood.

2138
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,780
There's no buddies, we're a buddies.

2139
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,260
Like,

2140
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:51,480
yeah.

2141
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:51,740
Yeah, yeah.

2142
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,480
To the left.

2143
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:53,720
Yeah.

2144
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:55,500
Great.

2145
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,060
That's been pinged on the map.

2146
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,120
That's my ping.

2147
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,080
So then follow it.

2148
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,580
That's my ping.

2149
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,900
So why don't you give sure for credit?

2150
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,140
I don't know about that.

2151
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,420
If you look at the map, I'm yellow.

2152
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:10,720
Are you?

2153
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,540
How do you know that?

2154
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:11,980
He's not lying.

2155
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,560
At the bottom left, we have our colors.

2156
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,740
I'm green, green, green.

2157
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,620
Light blue.

2158
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,500
You are red and I am yellow.

2159
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,620
Or maybe you're colorblind.

2160
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,940
Me say a long ramp.

2161
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,640
Alright, where are we going, boys?

2162
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:35,000
Probably Harmonizers again, but they're really far, so someone's probably on them by now.

2163
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,840
Wait, someone left a car here.

2164
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,880
No, it's just a random car.

2165
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:40,760
Yeah?

2166
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,520
There's one in front of the other teleporter as well.

2167
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,420
Alright dude, where is it?

2168
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,240
Where's that car?

2169
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:51,040
At the other teleporter.

2170
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,780
There was no car there.

2171
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,720
There was.

2172
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,000
No, there wasn't.

2173
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,680
There's another one of these cars.

2174
01:01:59,160 --> 01:01:59,900
Oh, I see it.

2175
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,520
They're just dumb and dumb.

2176
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah.

2177
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,100
You know, it's smart, I don't.

2178
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:05,240
No, yes.

2179
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,100
What?

2180
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,500
Wait, which one is it?

2181
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,380
Who's who?

2182
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,360
This was used, wasn't it?

2183
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,340
I thought we're on a bunny system.

2184
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,520
I'll leave that up to interpretation.

2185
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,860
I thought we're on a bunny system, sure boy.

2186
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,800
You can have dumb buddies.

2187
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,580
Yeah,

2188
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,600
it's smart, smart, smart and dumb order.

2189
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,840
Yeah, I can have dumb buddies.

2190
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,700
Smart and smart and smart and dumb order.

2191
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,700
Good combo.

2192
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,500
I think someone's on that harmonizer.

2193
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,020
There's three of them.

2194
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:40,760
They're all on.

2195
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:41,680
Three of them are yellow.

2196
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:42,780
You want to fight them?

2197
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,880
One of those is a care pack beam.

2198
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,840
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

2199
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,500
I think I know who the dumb one is.

2200
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:57,960
Dumb ass.

2201
01:02:59,180 --> 01:02:59,540
Saiba.

2202
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:01,460
Saiba.

2203
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:01,880
Saiba.

2204
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,800
Let's try and fight them, but they're kind of in the middle of zone.

2205
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,000
Saiba.

2206
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,260
Let's fight them.

2207
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,220
Oh, they shoot back.

2208
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:12,660
Fuck, GTA.

2209
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,480
Shoot the tires out.

2210
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,080
They're going behind you.

2211
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:14,860
There's one behind you.

2212
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:15,700
I'm shooting.

2213
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,040
I'm shooting.

2214
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:16,700
Reload, reload.

2215
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,100
Oh, you might need to...

2216
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,520
Whoa!

2217
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,900
I can't shoot because you activated the armor.

2218
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,020
Yeah.

2219
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:23,520
Oh!

2220
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,800
Get this guy in the blue car.

2221
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:26,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2222
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,860
In the Harry Potter car.

2223
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:28,980
Yeah, focus his car.

2224
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,800
Get back in, Doki.

2225
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:30,520
Oh, my God.

2226
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,700
Where is armor going down?

2227
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,460
Where is armor going down?

2228
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
I'm putting it down now.

2229
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:35,460
You guys...

2230
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,240
My stop is to zoom.

2231
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,580
Drive by.

2232
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,200
I stopped them.

2233
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:41,480
Nice.

2234
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,380
Oh, that's you.

2235
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,060
Oh, my God.

2236
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,160
What's going on?

2237
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:46,840
In the close building.

2238
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,380
In the close building.

2239
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:48,660
Yeah, yeah.

2240
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:49,480
We got him on scan.

2241
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:49,880
I'm healing.

2242
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,640
I'm going with Shurfer.

2243
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,000
Yeah, go kill him.

2244
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,320
Wait, this hurts.

2245
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:54,680
This hurts.

2246
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,400
I got puddled.

2247
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:57,440
Ah, ah, ah.

2248
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:58,500
Chill, chill, chill, chill.

2249
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:58,920
I can't do anything.

2250
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,400
I don't know where he is.

2251
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:01,340
He's up there.

2252
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,020
He's on the roof.

2253
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:02,920
Hold on.

2254
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,040
He's throwing a bunch of shit at us.

2255
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,040
Yeah.

2256
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,280
Oh, my God.

2257
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:06,640
All my bolts missed.

2258
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,160
It's Aiden the destroyer.

2259
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,500
Oh, it's them.

2260
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:10,660
Take TP.

2261
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:10,960
Take TP.

2262
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,200
Yeah.

2263
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:12,280
I got TP at the bottom.

2264
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,040
I'm just burning, dude.

2265
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:14,420
Hold on.

2266
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:15,660
I don't have heals.

2267
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:16,140
I don't have heals.

2268
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,760
Look down and press it.

2269
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,840
I'm dying through the fucking...

2270
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,860
Oh, my God.

2271
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:21,900
I died through the window.

2272
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:22,680
Outside, outside.

2273
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,280
He's one.

2274
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:23,760
He's one inside.

2275
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:25,960
I got him.

2276
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:26,260
I got him.

2277
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,240
Oh, fuck.

2278
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:28,700
Another window here.

2279
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,540
Another window here.

2280
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,180
Just play your life map.

2281
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,600
I mean, we have respawned.

2282
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:34,880
Do we?

2283
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:35,760
Yeah.

2284
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:36,780
Do we?

2285
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:37,620
Oh, yeah, we did.

2286
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:37,900
Yeah.

2287
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,880
We never...

2288
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,700
We only...

2289
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:40,040
Give me knock?

2290
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:40,580
What the fuck?

2291
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:43,900
I'm giving you knock.

2292
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,760
I'm knocking you.

2293
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,280
I'm getting...

2294
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,060
I'm body blocking.

2295
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:46,940
I'm body blocking.

2296
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,440
I can maybe get the reset here.

2297
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,740
You're getting stabbed through the window, but they're missing.

2298
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:51,840
Wait.

2299
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,800
Is that a different team?

2300
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,600
Is that a different team?

2301
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2302
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,680
And I'm gonna use my wall as soon as you res me.

2303
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:58,620
I'm resing?

2304
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,220
I already used my heal, by the way.

2305
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:01,860
I had to heal myself.

2306
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,540
Stop crawling.

2307
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:03,680
Oh.

2308
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:04,400
Stop crawling!

2309
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,460
I heard you say I'm gonna...

2310
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:11,860
I heard you say I'm gonna make space, so I went to walk to them.

2311
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:12,860
I can't see anything.

2312
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:13,620
I can't see anything.

2313
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,340
I'm inside of you guys.

2314
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,800
I can't tell.

2315
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,680
Are you inside of me?

2316
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,380
I'm trying to find him.

2317
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,840
He's inside of you?

2318
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,680
How does it feel?

2319
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,240
How does it...

2320
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,380
I'm sneaking us when we res.

2321
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,440
It's rough over here.

2322
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:32,960
It's rough.

2323
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,260
I'm so confused.

2324
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,000
Okay.

2325
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,160
You guys see everyone on the map.

2326
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,180
Good job.

2327
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,140
I don't know what's happening.

2328
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:41,960
I don't know.

2329
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:42,780
I don't know.

2330
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,520
There's one inside.

2331
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,320
There's one inside.

2332
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:44,980
In the smoke.

2333
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,640
In the smoke.

2334
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:48,780
Really?

2335
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,100
They are right there, right there.

2336
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,000
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, over here!

2337
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,080
I'm re-sing!

2338
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,100
I'm re-sing!

2339
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,460
I'm re-sing yet again.

2340
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,920
You guys are fine.

2341
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,100
I don't have heals.

2342
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:05,300
Oh no!

2343
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,600
On top, there's a window!

2344
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,140
I'm healing.

2345
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,820
There's a team on the window.

2346
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,160
I'll fight the other side.

2347
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,780
There's another team.

2348
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,280
There's more outside.

2349
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,500
Can you res him?

2350
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,000
I got a reload.

2351
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,020
I didn't reload just last night.

2352
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,420
Guys, I didn't do anything.

2353
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,780
I was just res bot.

2354
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:30,940
I was res bot.

2355
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,060
I died twice.

2356
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,680
Me and RPR did the thing.

2357
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,400
I resed RPR and I resed him.

2358
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,860
I made smokes in a can.

2359
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,280
The scan was good, actually.

2360
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,960
I know it was a good scan.

2361
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,100
Everything else was a little bit tragic.

2362
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:53,780
I would've killed Aiden.

2363
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,880
I would've killed Aiden, but my first shot hit the fucking wall because it's the third person.

2364
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,200
I don't know why they didn't push.

2365
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,200
Someone's getting shot?

2366
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:05,880
Question mark?

2367
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,520
I think they died in their bag, that's why.

2368
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,620
What's going on anymore?

2369
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:09,820
Like...

2370
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:10,280
I'm scanning?

2371
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,420
There's no one on scan who's fighting demons?

2372
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:12,720
It was far.

2373
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,160
It was far.

2374
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:13,240
It was far.

2375
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,400
No, they were far.

2376
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,320
We won against the demons, guys.

2377
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,400
We won.

2378
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,120
Okay, I'm here.

2379
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,060
Dude, the shotgun went crazy angle online.

2380
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:21,560
Oh, yeah.

2381
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,920
The auto shotgun fucks.

2382
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,080
The shotgun did not go crazy for me.

2383
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,060
Bro, you were on the ground.

2384
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,840
Just like, you can fucking use the camera.

2385
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,540
You should see what happened when I tried to shoot him on the roof.

2386
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,500
Dude, we live.

2387
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,840
That was some Mad Max shit right there.

2388
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,440
What the car chase into the fucking...

2389
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,780
The Harry Potter car, I'm fucking him up.

2390
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,600
I hit 42 on it.

2391
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,900
Can you not steal... 700?

2392
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,700
Can you not steal other people's things?

2393
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:51,480
Yeah, you can.

2394
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,480
What do you mean?

2395
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:52,820
What do you mean?

2396
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:53,120
What do you mean?

2397
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:58,260
Well, it said there was a shotgun with Skullpiercer and I picked it up and now I don't have a Skullpiercer.

2398
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,080
I saw it.

2399
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:00,440
You don't have it on your gun?

2400
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,180
No, I saw it.

2401
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:01,460
No.

2402
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,400
I did.

2403
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:04,960
Oh, that's where it went.

2404
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:05,860
Someone yoinked it.

2405
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:06,980
Yeah, someone took it.

2406
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,240
Well, I was looting it?

2407
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,720
No, I had a high X ammo thing.

2408
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,740
My explosive changes your gun, by the way.

2409
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,960
It changes like what it does.

2410
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:15,440
It's weird.

2411
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,660
Oh, okay.

2412
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,660
Can I take it off?

2413
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,160
No.

2414
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,440
I only have two smokes, bro.

2415
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,480
It depends on what gun you have it on.

2416
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:22,480
It's on the Gladiator.

2417
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:23,960
It might be good.

2418
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,320
I don't know.

2419
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,000
I haven't used it on that.

2420
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,760
But on the DMR, it literally turns the DMR into a shit gun.

2421
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,920
I mean, this was from the Aiden's team, right?

2422
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:30,640
So it should be good.

2423
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,180
I can't move these guys in the body blocking.

2424
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:33,240
Yeah, my bad.

2425
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,060
Can't back?

2426
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,140
Can't back?

2427
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:36,620
Can't grab that.

2428
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:36,660
Can't grab that.

2429
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,900
That's like literally next to us.

2430
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,500
Let's just give it to us.

2431
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,100
Yeah, we have five cars outside our fucking building.

2432
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,200
Grab one of the whips.

2433
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,300
All right, Trevor.

2434
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,140
Buddy system.

2435
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,140
Yeah, you got your own car.

2436
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,280
Okay, I guess.

2437
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,140
No one's on it.

2438
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:49,680
No one's on it.

2439
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,560
It's good to have your own car.

2440
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,060
I believe in you.

2441
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,140
I don't wanna... No, my car has no wheel!

2442
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,940
You guys shot this car's wheel off!

2443
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,880
There was like 17 million cars there.

2444
01:08:59,160 --> 01:08:59,780
I'm running back.

2445
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,080
Uh-uh.

2446
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:04,940
I'm running back.

2447
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,160
My car has no wheel.

2448
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,480
Why didn't you just grab your car?

2449
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,260
Dude, other car was...

2450
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,680
No, I'm talking about RPR.

2451
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,200
This guy drives over the car.

2452
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,280
He was in a bad spot.

2453
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:13,380
He was in a bad spot.

2454
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:14,540
Res me!

2455
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,320
Okay, okay, okay.

2456
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,680
I'm making a portal.

2457
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,400
I'm inside the building.

2458
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,100
I'm making a portal.

2459
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:19,660
I'm making a portal.

2460
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:20,200
I killed one.

2461
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,540
We knocked one.

2462
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,620
Okay, I'm teleporting you.

2463
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:23,280
Yeah, teleport.

2464
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:23,700
I'm scanning.

2465
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,300
I think these guys are killable.

2466
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,940
Yeah, we killed them after I get resed.

2467
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,160
After resed.

2468
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,320
And then I have no heals because I used that on Mac.

2469
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,380
I'm not gonna play up the left.

2470
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,120
I have no, I have no, I have no.

2471
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,000
I am not.

2472
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,020
I got knocked again through the window.

2473
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:41,720
Hold on, hold on.

2474
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,120
Yeah, there is a.

2475
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:42,540
Rest me here.

2476
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,360
Rest me here.

2477
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:45,940
I'm resing.

2478
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:46,740
It's found at PS.

2479
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,580
It's found at PS.

2480
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:48,340
Oh my god.

2481
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:49,440
You can res, you can.

2482
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,080
You can use TP.

2483
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:51,500
Oh, you couldn't.

2484
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,000
It's gone.

2485
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:52,560
It's just gone.

2486
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,460
Oh, he got full kill.

2487
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,800
I could put an ult on his body.

2488
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,480
Can I ult on your body?

2489
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,180
They are on it, just be careful.

2490
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,860
Okay, so that car has no wheel.

2491
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,920
They are driving away.

2492
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,660
They are driving away, you can get me.

2493
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:15,960
Yeah, just get me.

2494
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:16,280
They are left.

2495
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,940
What, fair play?

2496
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,320
In this day and age?

2497
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,640
I am going to ult on his banner.

2498
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,240
You shouldn't need to.

2499
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,400
Just put a Q down.

2500
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,980
My body is against the garage.

2501
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,140
Oh, they are shooting someone else now.

2502
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,380
Hold on, let me Q.

2503
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,960
Oh man, they suck my box dry.

2504
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,200
I see all the attachments.

2505
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,680
I mean, there are a bunch of boxes in that other spot.

2506
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,860
No one looted the dead kid.

2507
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,280
In front of us.

2508
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,360
I think they DC'd.

2509
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:47,940
Free kill.

2510
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,920
Full finish him, full finish him.

2511
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,720
They got the little shield tank.

2512
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,000
Let's keep shooting it.

2513
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,120
Press Y and then left correct me.

2514
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:55,980
It's T.

2515
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:56,920
It's not much T.

2516
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,240
Does this make me a bad person?

2517
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:00,760
No.

2518
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,360
Do it.

2519
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,180
Did you kill him?

2520
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,740
Alright, I'm the good person.

2521
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,840
Yeah, you're a good person.

2522
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:07,960
Ow, I got snapped more right!

2523
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:09,480
What?

2524
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,400
You guys start from there.

2525
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:12,960
They're on that building R.

2526
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,360
Nice shield.

2527
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,260
Did they full kill the guy that you bullied?

2528
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:16,720
No.

2529
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:17,180
Yeah.

2530
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:17,760
Oh, you did?

2531
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:18,440
Oh, yeah.

2532
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,280
Who was it?

2533
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,480
Nice bully.

2534
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,180
A power?

2535
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,360
Okay.

2536
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,280
Nice bully.

2537
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,280
Oh, that's why they fall left.

2538
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,080
Are you gonna loot?

2539
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,640
Yeah, I'm good.

2540
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:29,880
Okay.

2541
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,440
Did we get the hill?

2542
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,200
Can we get the hill?

2543
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,100
I'm gonna grab that guy.

2544
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:33,800
They're shooting my tires!

2545
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,260
He has blue.

2546
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,220
I don't think he has anything.

2547
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,100
We should get on the hill, guys.

2548
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:38,060
We should go on the hill.

2549
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,380
I just wanted his attachments and shit.

2550
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:43,480
Why don't we just drive back to the house with five million different death boxes?

2551
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:44,900
Oh my God!

2552
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:46,560
I'm scared.

2553
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,400
Where do we drive to?

2554
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,160
They're shooting at our car.

2555
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,280
I think we need to go up the hill.

2556
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,060
We go up the hill.

2557
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:51,700
We go take aight.

2558
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,940
Can you go in front of us?

2559
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:54,680
Go straight now.

2560
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:56,560
There's a team up to our 140.

2561
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,440
There's a team up to your left.

2562
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:57,880
Be careful.

2563
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:58,520
Okay.

2564
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,360
I'm going straight.

2565
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,700
And there's a team above us as well.

2566
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,880
There's a team straight above us as well.

2567
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:02,620
Turn around.

2568
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,680
Go below the bridge and chill.

2569
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,820
Let's play low grab, let's play low grab.

2570
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,160
Yeah yeah.

2571
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,900
He's shooting my car.

2572
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,840
AD car, air.

2573
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,500
Harry Potter car.

2574
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,060
I'm jumping out.

2575
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,660
Use as my cars coming.

2576
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,080
Ghost prone in a bush!

2577
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,000
From the house!

2578
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:29,640
If the car gonna blow it's gonna be real bad, guys.

2579
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,340
You're safe by me!

2580
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,440
I'm not safe.

2581
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,540
Guys, I told you, I can't.

2582
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,400
I shouldn't be driving.

2583
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:38,540
I have my... I have my shield, but I'm gonna bleed out pretty fast.

2584
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,240
Two more seconds of the shield.

2585
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:40,660
It's okay.

2586
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,180
Shift boy's proning.

2587
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,600
I got full killed in the smoke, though.

2588
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,280
Can you grab that shit?

2589
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:46,800
Yeah.

2590
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,000
I'm extracting his juice.

2591
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,780
I have smokes in my bag, too, by the way.

2592
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,860
They're kind of moving up on you guys.

2593
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:52,520
Nice.

2594
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:53,960
I'm watching.

2595
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:54,960
They're coming in with a car.

2596
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:55,640
They're coming in with a car.

2597
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:56,760
Don't get run over.

2598
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:57,680
Don't get run over.

2599
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,040
T3 spawned me.

2600
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:00,700
T3 spawned me.

2601
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,400
That's crazy.

2602
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:03,480
Bro, he's gonna squish you.

2603
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:04,860
T3 spawned.

2604
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:05,300
T3 spawned.

2605
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:05,660
T3 in left.

2606
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,260
Bro, that car just kidnapped me.

2607
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:09,500
Yeah.

2608
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:10,860
One close.

2609
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:11,880
I'm in the smoke.

2610
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:12,260
In the smoke.

2611
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,020
Shoot this game.

2612
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:13,440
He's prone.

2613
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:13,680
He's prone.

2614
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:13,960
He's prone.

2615
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,920
Oh, this is... Wait, was he prone?

2616
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,000
That looked like he was down.

2617
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:19,620
Behind you.

2618
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:19,760
Behind you.

2619
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:19,860
Behind you.

2620
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,100
Behind you.

2621
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,040
No one.

2622
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:22,500
From me.

2623
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:22,780
From me.

2624
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:23,620
Pushing from me up here.

2625
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:24,860
He's getting shot in the back.

2626
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,120
Hold on.

2627
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:25,460
Hold on.

2628
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:25,500
Hold on.

2629
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:25,600
Hold on.

2630
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,520
I can't help you.

2631
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:28,860
From the right.

2632
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:29,160
From the right.

2633
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,140
Three of them from the right.

2634
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,260
There's two different teams.

2635
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,220
Two different teams.

2636
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:32,760
Just see alive.

2637
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,220
Just see alive.

2638
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,220
Take the car.

2639
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:34,580
Take the car.

2640
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,080
Hover away.

2641
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:35,460
Fly away.

2642
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,560
Leave us.

2643
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,900
Just run.

2644
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,420
I don't need the fly mode.

2645
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:40,900
I'm good.

2646
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,880
He's got the drive mode.

2647
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:44,400
Goodbye.

2648
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:49,640
He's fine.

2649
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:50,540
He's fine.

2650
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:50,860
He's fine.

2651
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,140
Get on that tree.

2652
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:52,820
You're in on that tree.

2653
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,400
Oh, my God.

2654
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:56,940
Oh, yeah, he is.

2655
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:00,740
Heal.

2656
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,760
This guy is pushing.

2657
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,420
They're all kind of naiding you.

2658
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,480
They're pushing.

2659
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:05,920
They're pushing.

2660
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:06,600
They're all pushing you.

2661
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,860
They really want to kill you.

2662
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:09,360
Wait.

2663
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:09,500
Wait.

2664
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:09,880
They're...

2665
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,420
You can press caps and camera switch.

2666
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:12,880
To have a left-hand peek.

2667
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,940
There was a team that wanted to rush you.

2668
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:18,620
So, careful.

2669
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:20,720
He's killing them.

2670
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:22,920
I believe.

2671
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,220
I believe in...

2672
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:28,080
I thought... There was like a downed message that showed up.

2673
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,060
I thought I killed him.

2674
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:35,460
Bro, it's the team we killed, they got respawned because...

2675
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:36,880
We got the time.

2676
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,140
Wait, how did they get respawned?

2677
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:38,660
Because the timing.

2678
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,160
Because they didn't full die.

2679
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:41,160
Oh.

2680
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,660
You get one respawn if it's before a certain time, I think?

2681
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:53,180
Yeah, like, uh, the zone, yeah, like, at a certain time, the respawn gets turned off.

2682
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,360
I mean, what do you got?

2683
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,120
Top A?

2684
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,280
Wait, there's 12 teams.

2685
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,400
Wait, two, four, we had seven kills.

2686
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:04,000
And eight, yeah.

2687
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,620
Guys, I don't think I should drive, I think.

2688
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,160
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, I thought Shurfer was driving.

2689
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,280
I would never get in the car if I knew you were driving.

2690
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,180
I wanted to swap seats, to be fair.

2691
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:19,700
Well, sometimes it's better for everyone to have a car, because you don't have to wait.

2692
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,320
Yeah, but we were, like, scrambling to get Machap.

2693
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,140
So we didn't take up all the cars.

2694
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,180
Yeah, and then the one car I got, lost the wheel.

2695
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,880
Also, like, does it not show you when you...

2696
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,160
Is there a way to show when your car is getting damaged?

2697
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:37,840
Unless, other than, like...

2698
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:38,840
Yeah.

2699
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:39,460
Oh.

2700
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,000
It also just looks fucked up.

2701
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:47,120
I know, like, other than the fact that your pieces of your car, like, falls apart, is there, like, any other way to see it?

2702
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,300
Yeah, this should be horrible.

2703
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,780
I want to be a passenger princess.

2704
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,640
14 points, though.

2705
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,360
I mean, not bad.

2706
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:56,860
It's horrible.

2707
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:57,420
Yeah.

2708
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:02,620
Wait, how many points do we... What placement do we need to get to tomorrow?

2709
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:03,920
Top... Top six.

2710
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:04,740
The cutoff was, like, 50.

2711
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:06,980
Yeah, it's top six.

2712
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:07,700
Top what?

2713
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:08,660
Top six?

2714
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:08,940
Yeah.

2715
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:10,980
Yeah.

2716
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:12,600
Yeah.

2717
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:12,620
Yeah.

2718
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,580
Yeah, the cutoff is 51.

2719
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,160
From Oscar.

2720
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,080
Yeah, but...

2721
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,240
Yeah, we went third before this, so...

2722
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,520
With 17 points, we're gonna be at 40 points, though, so...

2723
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,140
Yeah, but next game is last game.

2724
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:29,500
Yeah.

2725
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:29,820
LG.

2726
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,160
LG, LG.

2727
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,060
All right, that first fight, though.

2728
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:38,740
That first fight was fucking crazy.

2729
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,960
Sorry, 37 points, not a force.

2730
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:41,360
Pretty good, 7 points.

2731
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,360
I dropped my spaghetti everywhere.

2732
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:44,460
What?

2733
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:45,360
During the win?

2734
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:46,620
I thought you had chicken katsu.

2735
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,040
Yeah, what about the chicken katsu?

2736
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,520
No, I have it in my pockets for later.

2737
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:51,860
Oh.

2738
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,260
Oh.

2739
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:52,980
I dropped it everywhere.

2740
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:00,520
I don't think I shot my... Yeah, I definitely didn't shot my gun during that.

2741
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,520
I did better at the end.

2742
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:06,420
With that, all I did was throw my scan, and then you killed people through smoke.

2743
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:06,920
Works fine.

2744
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,820
All right, that for me, I just... I was just a res bot.

2745
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,620
Res heal, res heal, portal, res.

2746
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:16,800
Honestly, we had a crazy reset in the house that shouldn't have happened.

2747
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:17,360
Yeah.

2748
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,160
Yeah.

2749
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,280
Then that shotgun went crazy in the house that ain't gonna light it.

2750
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,560
Yeah, people just swing in and got two-pumped.

2751
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:25,600
Yup.

2752
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,200
Although, I think I killed three people on the stairs then.

2753
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,220
Yeah.

2754
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:31,460
Just doink, doink, doink, doink.

2755
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:32,160
In one mag.

2756
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:39,980
Oh.

2757
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:44,280
The DMR, does it have, like, a shot limit?

2758
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:45,120
No.

2759
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:45,540
No.

2760
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,800
It shoots as fast as you can click.

2761
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,440
Can't you just bind it to scroll wheel?

2762
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,140
What?

2763
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,020
I didn't even do that!

2764
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:52,980
I mean...

2765
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,400
It has absurd recoil though.

2766
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:55,180
Yeah.

2767
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,260
Yeah.

2768
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,140
Wasn't this someone who used a hotkey?

2769
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,660
Well, hopefully the game has macro protection.

2770
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,020
Yeah.

2771
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,960
The sweats are gonna have some macro set up for that shit.

2772
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,940
Yeah, I'm pretty sure people are gonna macro that.

2773
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,200
That's okay, none of the macros are in this lobby, right?

2774
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,160
I think I'm gonna play Ziva next game.

2775
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:18,340
Okay.

2776
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,500
I did get shark girl value this game, but...

2777
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,320
Oh, what are you gonna play?

2778
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:23,640
Ziva.

2779
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,580
Gibby cat.

2780
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,180
Oh.

2781
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:33,200
Oh my god, he's metacrafting right now.

2782
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,580
What does the X2 mean?

2783
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,960
Oh my god, how many nades does he have?

2784
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:50,700
He's got a lot.

2785
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:52,800
He's still throwing them.

2786
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,060
Maybe he has something that refills his nades?

2787
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,260
Yeah, like he's still throwing them.

2788
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,860
He threw five or six before that.

2789
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:02,320
Yeah.

2790
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:03,860
He has more.

2791
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,580
He has no meds then?

2792
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,240
He just carries a ton of mollies already.

2793
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,380
That guy just threw 15 nades.

2794
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,160
We're getting, like, roughly terrible.

2795
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,780
I'm pretty sure that guy just died.

2796
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,320
Where did he come from?

2797
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:24,440
This guy...

2798
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,420
Ronan just blasted off.

2799
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,160
This team's just, like...

2800
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,360
What is he looking at?

2801
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:29,760
What?

2802
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:30,680
What did he see?

2803
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,480
There's, like, a hipfire aiming button there as well.

2804
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:34,640
Yes, there is.

2805
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,260
I need to give you the bind for that.

2806
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,220
Go to...

2807
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,380
Hipfire aiming button?

2808
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:38,620
Yeah.

2809
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:40,040
Go to mouse and keyboard.

2810
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,220
Go to custom binds.

2811
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,560
And it's called shoulder fire.

2812
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:43,940
Underneath basic combat.

2813
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,420
So, like, you hold for hipfire.

2814
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,460
What do you bind it to?

2815
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,420
I bound it to a side mouse button.

2816
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,360
Like, mouse four?

2817
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:51,280
Yeah.

2818
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,260
I'm not surprised that they would.

2819
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:53,820
Shoulder fire?

2820
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:54,780
Yeah.

2821
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,120
You basically aim it while in third person.

2822
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,200
Shoulder fire and ADS or just shoulder fire?

2823
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,120
Just shoulder fire.

2824
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,100
Shoulder fire and ADS will double bind it.

2825
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:03,560
Yeah.

2826
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:10,120
And make it so, like, you can basically hold right click to shoulder fire and tap right click to go into your sights.

2827
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:10,680
Oh.

2828
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:11,960
That's too complicated.

2829
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,740
Guys, I did a lot of damage, even though I felt like I did nothing.

2830
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,380
Guys, I improved.

2831
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,520
It wasn't 23 damage this time.

2832
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:22,020
Wait, I almost got RPR damage.

2833
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,540
I just need 400.

2834
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,060
All my damage...

2835
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,540
All my damage came from shotgunning, like, three dudes on stairs, dude.

2836
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:29,360
I liked it, dude.

2837
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,600
Wait, does it...

2838
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:30,940
You have to...

2839
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,380
Is there a new lobby every match?

2840
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:33,400
Wait.

2841
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,340
Ever really hates me.

2842
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:35,840
You just declined my friend's request.

2843
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,160
Oh, I didn't know you sent me one.

2844
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:37,780
My fault, bro.

2845
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:38,640
Send it?

2846
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:39,920
I thought it was just a recommendation.

2847
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:40,980
No.

2848
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,480
Even if it's a recommendation, you weren't gonna accept it.

2849
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:44,720
It's okay.

2850
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:45,520
It's okay.

2851
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,060
I'm going to master for me.

2852
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,080
That's on me.

2853
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,060
That's fucked.

2854
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:49,380
All good, bro.

2855
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:49,720
All good, bro.

2856
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,260
You're just toxic.

2857
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:52,660
It's a loser.

2858
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,040
It's okay.

2859
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,580
There has to be losers in the world.

2860
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:57,420
I'm one of them.

2861
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,220
Without losers, there wouldn't be any winners.

2862
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:01,940
Yeah, exactly.

2863
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:03,080
They're important.

2864
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,600
How are we gonna find out who are the winners?

2865
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,400
I'm gonna go dig some ditches.

2866
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:08,840
I'm one of them.

2867
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,440
You guys got kicked out of the lobby too?

2868
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,920
Every single part of me is replaced.

2869
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,280
Will I still be here?

2870
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:18,920
The lobby closes.

2871
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,120
Oh, every match?

2872
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:20,380
Okay.

2873
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,300
I just wanted to be sure.

2874
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:21,620
Yeah.

2875
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,580
Yeah, and they have to tally all the points and whatnot.

2876
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,320
Oh, I see.

2877
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:30,180
And then someone doesn't join the lobby for 20 minutes.

2878
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,600
Yeah, and then we have to wait for that.

2879
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,340
I think like...

2880
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,860
I think we spend more time waiting.

2881
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,580
That's life.

2882
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,780
That is life.

2883
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,980
That's life out on the rift.

2884
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:45,540
We're not last.

2885
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,020
We better not be last.

2886
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:48,660
After that first game.

2887
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:49,740
I'm not gonna lie, guys.

2888
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:53,140
Using an ability on this high ping, man.

2889
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:55,020
Takes a while, bro.

2890
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:56,320
To put the wall on him away.

2891
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:58,420
Takes me a minute.

2892
01:21:59,220 --> 01:21:59,880
It's okay, bro.

2893
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:00,480
It's okay.

2894
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,320
It's okay, dude.

2895
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,820
You did your best.

2896
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,020
And we're proud of you.

2897
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,580
I'm not.

2898
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,180
Oh.

2899
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,300
He's not.

2900
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:09,560
He just hates me, sir.

2901
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,180
He's a hater.

2902
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,160
He's your biggest hater.

2903
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,620
No, I'm a realist.

2904
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,320
So he...

2905
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,580
He might actually be my biggest hater for whatever reason.

2906
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:20,460
I don't hate.

2907
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:21,440
I appreciate.

2908
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,000
And why don't you believe in him?

2909
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,780
Because I'll damage them one game.

2910
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:31,980
I'm missing my once a year Minecraft server with my friends for this.

2911
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:32,620
I'm sad.

2912
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:33,780
Minecraft.

2913
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,440
Oh, so you don't...

2914
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,800
Oh, so you don't want...

2915
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:36,960
I'm missing the annual Minecraft.

2916
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,480
You don't want to get paid?

2917
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:39,200
I'm missing the annual Minecraft.

2918
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,000
Okay, so...

2919
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:42,040
Oh, man.

2920
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:42,800
So sad...

2921
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,620
We need...

2922
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,780
To get a top three.

2923
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,100
So sad...

2924
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,000
That you...

2925
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,400
You had to get sponsored today.

2926
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:49,900
Honestly, Saibouted.

2927
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,820
That's what I'm saying up here.

2928
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:52,720
Saibouted.

2929
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,120
Saibouted.

2930
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,120
I'm getting training right now.

2931
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,600
I'm missing fucking Minecraft.

2932
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,140
You could just join Minecraft later.

2933
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,120
It's still there.

2934
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,260
It's not like they're gonna close the survey.

2935
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,040
No, you gotta be there right at the start.

2936
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:05,980
You gotta be there at the right armorer.

2937
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,140
Yeah, exactly, bro.

2938
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,380
They've already killed the under dragon.

2939
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:09,420
But tell them to stop!

2940
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:11,460
If they are your friends, they will stop.

2941
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,280
It's over.

2942
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:19,860
Not real.

2943
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:20,520
Not real.

2944
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:21,760
Not real bros.

2945
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,730
Who the fuck are these guys in my training?

2946
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:28,630
What?

2947
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:29,410
All the...

2948
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:30,630
small things.

2949
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:35,730
You got, like, random people in your training room?

2950
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:36,250
Yeah.

2951
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:37,390
How did that happen?

2952
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:39,870
Happens in Apex, too.

2953
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,110
It's a pretty universal BR bug, I guess.

2954
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:44,210
Whoa!

2955
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:45,410
Hey, guys.

2956
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:48,270
Look at the skins, guys, that you can buy.

2957
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:51,410
Oh my god, they have a gotcha.

2958
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:52,110
Yeah, they do.

2959
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:53,510
Oh my god.

2960
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:54,510
This game is for you.

2961
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,090
I definitely haven't done 40 pulls on it.

2962
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,170
Wait, you already did pulls?

2963
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,310
I know this game's a gotcha.

2964
01:23:58,670 --> 01:23:59,430
Yeah, they give you...

2965
01:23:59,430 --> 01:23:59,790
How did you?

2966
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:01,690
If you go to the, uh...

2967
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:01,970
Type bar?

2968
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:08,170
The event tab on the right, and you go to daily perks, they give you a thousand credits every day.

2969
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:08,950
Wait, really?

2970
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:10,490
Yeah.

2971
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:10,750
Yeah.

2972
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:11,310
Really?

2973
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:14,830
You can do that, or you can just stockpile them and buy the skins you want.

2974
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:16,510
We should stockpile them.

2975
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:19,690
I've been doing pulls, because I'm a gambling man.

2976
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:20,570
I wanna...

2977
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:21,550
Wait, the lobby's open.

2978
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:22,950
I wanna do pulls.

2979
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:25,150
It's an event on the right?

2980
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:28,830
You can do it after, because the lobby's open, and they're gonna yell at you.

2981
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:29,570
Yeah, but I'm...

2982
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:30,970
Okay, but I won't be the last person.

2983
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:33,050
They're gonna yell at you.

2984
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,430
You can't yell at me if I'm not last.

2985
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:36,030
They can, and they will.

2986
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:36,950
And they won't.

2987
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:37,530
I'm first.

2988
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,050
I'm first on our team, because I'm the best.

2989
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:41,690
First one to die.

2990
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:44,090
Wait, I can't go fourth slot?

2991
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,670
Where's the event?

2992
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:49,070
Are you sure it's top, right?

2993
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:57,190
Yeah, yeah, not like top top right, but like main menu, right hand side of your screen, like towards the top, but underneath the leaderboards and mailbox and stuff.

2994
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:58,390
Oh, oh, I see it.

2995
01:24:58,490 --> 01:24:58,870
I see it.

2996
01:24:58,990 --> 01:24:59,430
I see it.

2997
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:00,470
Yeah.

2998
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:01,770
Holy blind.

2999
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:02,870
Okay.

3000
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:06,750
Guys, type in this code so I can get...

3001
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,070
I can't even sell off that.

3002
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:10,470
It's shameless.

3003
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,050
Holy shit.

3004
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,870
Guys, use my referral code.

3005
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:15,070
Yeah, use my referral code.

3006
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:16,530
Guys, type in this shit.

3007
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:19,010
Get four free holes and a glider.

3008
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:20,050
Do you guys see this?

3009
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:23,330
First thing she did, bro.

3010
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:24,690
Type in this code, man.

3011
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:25,510
Type in this code.

3012
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:30,030
Also, click on my link pinned in my chat so you can wishlist this game right now.

3013
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:32,270
Because if you guys forgot, we are sponsored.

3014
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:33,610
Hashtag end.

3015
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:39,710
Make sure you wishlist the game yourselves.

3016
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:43,190
Alright, I'm getting it.

3017
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:44,750
Oh, I claimed Mindy.

3018
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:46,390
Nice.

3019
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:46,950
Gratz.

3020
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:48,130
I got it.

3021
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:49,350
Oh, claim her.

3022
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:51,190
Oh my god.

3023
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,070
I got pulls by adding friends.

3024
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:56,250
Alright.

3025
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:57,450
I'm gonna do my pull.

3026
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:00,850
Uh...

3027
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,350
How do I do this pull?

3028
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:03,670
Okay.

3029
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:04,390
Ten pulls.

3030
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:06,890
Confirmed.

3031
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:09,330
What did I get?

3032
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,950
What are these?

3033
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:19,310
Oh, I think I got like an emote.

3034
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:20,510
I couldn't tell.

3035
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:28,720
Okay.

3036
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,740
Gotta make sure I don't leak the password like somebody here.

3037
01:26:31,740 --> 01:27:01,080
I don't know.

3038
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,050
Someone almost got the password correct.

3039
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:12,470
In my chat.

3040
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:17,150
Now we're giving out hints to the password.

3041
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:21,230
Just a couple more digits, guys.

3042
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:22,550
Just a couple more.

3043
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:27,810
I mean, to be fair, it's between boobs and the other one.

3044
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:29,610
Because you're hot and you're cold.

3045
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,750
Solve my riddle.

3046
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,420
I think our group was definitely the easier group.

3047
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,000
Group A looked like a lot of sweats.

3048
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:46,240
Nah, we win.

3049
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,160
Yeah, that's why our group is easier.

3050
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,300
No, we win in Group A.

3051
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,500
I'm in Group A.

3052
01:27:55,700 --> 01:28:01,540
I think the people who are in the top six literally were playing this game every day since closed beta launched.

3053
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:03,240
Yeah, same as us.

3054
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,660
Yeah, sure for it.

3055
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,700
How many hours?

3056
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:06,640
How many hours?

3057
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,100
1,000.

3058
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,000
Alright.

3059
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:09,820
Screenshot.

3060
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:10,360
Right now.

3061
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,820
And my screenshot keybind is broken.

3062
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,240
Show it on stream then.

3063
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:16,960
Right now.

3064
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,540
That button's broken too.

3065
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:20,540
Oh.

3066
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,280
Okay.

3067
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:22,860
How about Discord screen share?

3068
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,800
I can't do that.

3069
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:25,300
Why not?

3070
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,800
My computer blows up.

3071
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:27,900
It does?

3072
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:28,960
Yeah.

3073
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,860
Is it like 100% chance or is it like a 50-50?

3074
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,640
It's like 100%.

3075
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,020
Oh, that's rough, buddy.

3076
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:40,820
I had someone, like, do something where they, like, optimize my PC and...

3077
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:41,700
Yeah!

3078
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:44,960
Who recommended you the optimization?

3079
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:46,600
I don't know.

3080
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,760
I found it on, uh, Craigslist.

3081
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:49,520
Oh.

3082
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:51,980
What's his name?

3083
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:56,140
I mean, if he fucked up your PC, you can just dox him and ruin his life.

3084
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:57,300
Huh?

3085
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:58,700
I mean...

3086
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,520
That's always an option.

3087
01:28:59,660 --> 01:28:59,900
Yeah.

3088
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,540
I mean, he ruined your PC.

3089
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,320
Why don't you just ruin his life now?

3090
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:03,340
I don't know.

3091
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:04,680
Hmm.

3092
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:07,950
What?

3093
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:08,910
Suska emoji.

3094
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:10,330
What?

3095
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,430
Do you feel bad for him?

3096
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:13,330
Yes.

3097
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:15,130
I feel bad for the common man.

3098
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:16,070
Why?

3099
01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:18,930
While living in this trap.

3100
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:25,910
We don't choose to get brought in.

3101
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:28,010
And we can't choose when to get brought out.

3102
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:28,030
We can't choose when to get brought out.

3103
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:29,630
Well...

3104
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:32,610
Well...

3105
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:33,690
Well...

3106
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:35,550
You guys implying something?

3107
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,770
I didn't say anything!

3108
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:38,790
I just...

3109
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:39,270
What do you mean?

3110
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:41,130
What are you implying?

3111
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:42,690
I didn't say anything.

3112
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:43,990
You guys trying to say something here?

3113
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:44,310
Or...

3114
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:45,210
I didn't say anything.

3115
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:46,250
What about you, Mac?

3116
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:47,310
What were you trying to say?

3117
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:49,450
Lightning strikes.

3118
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,560
Keep yourself safe.

3119
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,640
Trifor taught me that.

3120
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,460
Trifor taught me that.

3121
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,740
What is the meaning behind that, Trifor?

3122
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,120
You like keeping yourself safe?

3123
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:07,840
Yeah.

3124
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:10,960
Yeah, because you like speaking in, like, metaphors and shit.

3125
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:12,580
Metaphors?

3126
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:13,660
Yeah.

3127
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,900
That one isn't a metaphor.

3128
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,160
What is it?

3129
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:17,240
What am I talking about?

3130
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:23,720
You have a higher chance dying walking outside than staying inside, so you have to keep yourself safe.

3131
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:24,640
Yeah.

3132
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:26,360
That's what I meant.

3133
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:28,540
You gotta make sure you're safe inside.

3134
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,020
You gotta keep yourself safe tonight?

3135
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,240
Always.

3136
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,580
Always safe.

3137
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,900
Gotta be extra protected.

3138
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:44,560
I'm not a risk taker.

3139
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:44,980
Yeah.

3140
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,520
Always wear protection.

3141
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:48,920
Huh?

3142
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,080
What?

3143
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:51,180
To keep yourself safe.

3144
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:52,360
Huh?

3145
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,160
Yeah, make sure you're armored up.

3146
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,400
What the fuck are you talking about?

3147
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:58,500
What?

3148
01:30:58,680 --> 01:30:59,440
I lock mine.

3149
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,420
Huh?

3150
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:04,500
You just need to bail someone.

3151
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,440
Only Jesus has the key.

3152
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,440
Fuck.

3153
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,960
He's married to God, guys.

3154
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,480
He's keeping himself safe with God.

3155
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,130
We're all here.

3156
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:34,290
We're all here now.

3157
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:35,310
We're all here now.

3158
01:31:35,310 --> 01:31:37,570
We should start when- Oh, they're doing countdown!

3159
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:49,590
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, three, two, just to make sure we all get started on the same, same track.

3160
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:08,370
Last game.

3161
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:09,290
Yay!

3162
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:09,970
Let's go out with a bang.

3163
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:11,970
Let's end this with a dub.

3164
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:13,570
Yay!

3165
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:14,730
What place are we at now?

3166
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:16,030
We don't know.

3167
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:17,490
They never- Oh, no.

3168
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:18,450
Wait.

3169
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:20,710
My mod showed, sent it to me.

3170
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:22,630
We are fifth place.

3171
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:24,730
We're- Oh, no.

3172
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:27,670
We're two points ahead of sixth place.

3173
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:30,010
Okay.

3174
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,110
It's coming down to the wire.

3175
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:34,190
Wait behind us.

3176
01:32:34,430 --> 01:32:34,750
Yeah.

3177
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:35,630
We're locked in.

3178
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:38,110
If we just kill everyone in this lobby, we're good.

3179
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:38,990
Yeah.

3180
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:40,530
That's all we have to do.

3181
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:40,990
Kill them all, don't die.

3182
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:42,830
And then don't let me drive.

3183
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:43,130
You don't die?

3184
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:44,970
I think I'm going to die.

3185
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,470
Don't let me drive, guys.

3186
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:47,350
That's all that matters.

3187
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:50,170
Guys, if we're the last team alive, then we won.

3188
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:51,130
So, let's do that.

3189
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:51,870
That's true.

3190
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:52,430
That's true.

3191
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:57,550
Pretty simple.

3192
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:58,870
I think about it.

3193
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:03,190
We're starting on the right.

3194
01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:04,690
I mean, we just go observatory again.

3195
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:05,530
Just riding it out.

3196
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:07,350
Just go there.

3197
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:08,110
Actually, yeah.

3198
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:09,190
We can- Yeah, you can do that.

3199
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:09,410
Yeah.

3200
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:12,170
Do we- I don't think we make that, actually.

3201
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:14,290
Could we jump- Nah, we do.

3202
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:15,670
We just got to stretch it.

3203
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:18,470
I think I'm all right on testing that.

3204
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:21,110
Mack, you're the best player.

3205
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:21,770
You should go for it.

3206
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:23,610
You can do it, I believe.

3207
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:25,290
I'll stretch it.

3208
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:27,170
I stretch.

3209
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:30,430
I mean, if we land on any of these portals, there should be a car.

3210
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:31,590
I mean, we could just go here.

3211
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:32,750
There's going to be a car.

3212
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:35,550
There's going to be a car on either side of these portals.

3213
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:40,110
I believe.

3214
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:42,170
Yeah, we could just go here.

3215
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:42,730
Yeah, for that.

3216
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:45,430
I'm still believing.

3217
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:47,610
Wait, people are laughing on each other.

3218
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:48,830
Wait, people are griefing.

3219
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:51,310
Wait, they're actually griefing for points.

3220
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:51,830
Yeah.

3221
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:55,290
They're actually griefing for points right now.

3222
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:00,550
Us.

3223
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:02,850
Yay.

3224
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:06,270
There's a vehicular.

3225
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,290
Yeah, there's always a vehicle at the portals.

3226
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:12,430
I think I'm lagging.

3227
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:14,130
Yeah, someone is.

3228
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:15,130
No, I think Mac is.

3229
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:16,230
Oh.

3230
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:16,630
No.

3231
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:17,690
Because we're attached to him.

3232
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:19,050
I have 40 ping.

3233
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:21,490
I think it just looks like that.

3234
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:21,830
Yeah.

3235
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:23,050
Maybe.

3236
01:34:23,710 --> 01:34:24,530
Hello, everybody.

3237
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:28,270
It's like a... Like a... Dude, you're wasting fuel.

3238
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:31,230
We're gonna find more cops.

3239
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:31,410
We're going on a road trip.

3240
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:32,970
Dude, you're wasting fuel.

3241
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:35,250
We're on a road trip, everyone.

3242
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:38,810
Complaining at his backseat driver in my fucking face.

3243
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:40,150
Turn on the AC.

3244
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:41,890
Now.

3245
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:45,150
I'm stuck with Doki.

3246
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:45,630
Are we there yet?

3247
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:46,270
Holy shit.

3248
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:47,670
We're fucked over here.

3249
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:48,030
Are we there yet?

3250
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,670
Just drop me off with that armored car.

3251
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:52,430
I'm gonna go through the... The north place.

3252
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:55,130
I'm gonna drive this car into the fucking wall.

3253
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:56,110
You're just farming for kills.

3254
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:56,870
You're so smart.

3255
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:58,050
Why didn't we do that?

3256
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,870
You turned off your car too, or what?

3257
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:00,130
Why didn't my car just do that?

3258
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:00,850
Was that cool?

3259
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:05,290
AC is off the... Wait, why is the AC off?

3260
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:07,350
Don't deserve it.

3261
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:08,090
Global warming.

3262
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:08,430
Wait.

3263
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:10,510
Our fuel is wasting fuel right now.

3264
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:12,150
There's 15 cars here.

3265
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:16,130
Yeah, but you're wasting fuel.

3266
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:17,650
What if I find a fuel cell?

3267
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:17,990
What then?

3268
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:20,630
Then... Then we're not wasting fuel.

3269
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:24,310
But we are currently... I can't.

3270
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:24,650
I can't.

3271
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:24,930
I can't.

3272
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:25,390
I'm gonna lose it.

3273
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:29,850
Can I get the jet car and just run people over?

3274
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:30,710
He can.

3275
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:35,010
I mean, you could do it right now and then, like, respawn.

3276
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:37,330
Really?

3277
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:39,790
Just respawn back here.

3278
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:41,450
Yeah, yeah, we'll respawn.

3279
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:42,890
If you die, you respawn.

3280
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:43,530
Yeah.

3281
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:43,990
Really?

3282
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:45,850
You know, the downside is you give other people kills.

3283
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:46,950
Really?

3284
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:48,590
Yeah.

3285
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:49,270
No, I'm lying.

3286
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:50,810
Yeah.

3287
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:54,050
Yeah, typical RPR.

3288
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:54,970
I'm not surprised.

3289
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:55,310
Yeah, alright.

3290
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:00,570
There it is.

3291
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:04,170
I dropped a blue helmet.

3292
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,640
Yeah, RPR doesn't care for the environment.

3293
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,480
He just wants to waste gas.

3294
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:13,640
What the fuck did I do?

3295
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,420
He just want to waste fuel.

3296
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,120
That's a bad message.

3297
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,480
He's an electric car.

3298
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,340
RPRs are very impressionable.

3299
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,260
That's a very bad message.

3300
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,600
It's an electric car.

3301
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,060
You don't know that.

3302
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:26,760
Okay.

3303
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:28,160
It's a king.

3304
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:28,900
It's the future.

3305
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,200
It's a king.

3306
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,900
Trying to say it's a Tesla?

3307
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,480
He hates the Earth.

3308
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:38,120
He does.

3309
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:43,710
I bet he has bad...

3310
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:43,890
I bet he has bad...

3311
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:44,650
Zone came to us.

3312
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:45,910
Oh, yeah.

3313
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:46,370
That's good.

3314
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:46,810
Oh my god.

3315
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:48,750
How come I can't use this?

3316
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:49,910
Hello?

3317
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:51,990
Let me use this.

3318
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:52,710
Hello?

3319
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:53,990
Okay.

3320
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:56,550
She's struggling to loot.

3321
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:58,170
I'm trying to use...

3322
01:36:58,170 --> 01:36:58,450
I don't know.

3323
01:36:58,570 --> 01:36:59,090
It was pointless.

3324
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:00,870
It was pointless for me to say it.

3325
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:03,650
Hello, guys.

3326
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:08,450
I don't have a gladiator yet and I'm not comfortable with that.

3327
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:10,330
There's an AK here.

3328
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:12,190
There's a DMR too.

3329
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:15,850
Think about it.

3330
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:17,110
I have a DMR right now.

3331
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:21,030
You don't even have a point.

3332
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,510
I'm very far.

3333
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:22,310
Wait.

3334
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:23,570
Why are you so far from us?

3335
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:26,530
The other POI.

3336
01:37:27,090 --> 01:37:27,210
Oh.

3337
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:28,270
Maximizing.

3338
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:29,930
That's for point of interest, by the way.

3339
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:31,510
For those who don't know.

3340
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:33,030
That's a gamer term.

3341
01:37:33,570 --> 01:37:33,690
Yeah.

3342
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:34,710
Only real gamers know.

3343
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,930
Yeah.

3344
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:36,990
Only real gamers know what POIs is.

3345
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:38,710
I gotta explain it to the common man.

3346
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:40,790
Guys, what's the SITREP?

3347
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:45,290
The fuck are we talking about now?

3348
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:46,330
It stands for Situation Report.

3349
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:48,510
Jesus Christ.

3350
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:52,090
What is it?

3351
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:52,270
Yeah.

3352
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:53,270
What is the SITREP?

3353
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,010
So no SITREP or?

3354
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:55,070
I'm looting, dude.

3355
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:57,350
Currently I'm looting too.

3356
01:37:58,170 --> 01:37:58,610
Heard.

3357
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:00,670
What about on the other end?

3358
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:02,070
What about on the other side?

3359
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:03,090
I just got DMR, I guess.

3360
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:06,110
Guys, if we have builders, we can set up a FOB.

3361
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:07,390
Yeah?

3362
01:38:07,690 --> 01:38:08,310
What is that?

3363
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:09,570
Playing fucking squad.

3364
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:11,690
That sounds for Forward Operating Base.

3365
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:15,990
Yeah, I'm ironically used that in fucking Rust, by the way.

3366
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:16,710
Wait, really?

3367
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:20,910
At how many hours do we have to set up a FOB?

3368
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:23,630
What's the military time for it?

3369
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:24,390
It doesn't matter.

3370
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:25,490
It's gonna get offline raided.

3371
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:39,100
Jesus.

3372
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,300
Boink yeah.

3373
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:45,080
How is Jesus's word- participar?

3374
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,000
Like, what the fuck?

3375
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,580
You're using his name in vain.

3376
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:52,340
I'm shouting out to my boy Jesus.

3377
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:53,920
Yeah, they're best friends.

3378
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:55,400
He knows him personally.

3379
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,580
I'm shouting out to him.

3380
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,580
Giving him a shout out.

3381
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,520
He paid for it.

3382
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:03,920
Yeah, well, I just got sponsored by Jesus.

3383
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,700
Yeah, sponsored by Jesus, by the way.

3384
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:05,960
Hashtag Jesus.

3385
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:07,780
Hashtag ad.

3386
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:11,640
How would you know, huh?

3387
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:12,980
Are you good friends with Jesus?

3388
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,520
VTubers are against God's creation.

3389
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:18,400
Holy shit.

3390
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,960
But you're a VTuber too.

3391
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,560
It is said not to make false idols of yourself.

3392
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:27,780
I'm not an idol.

3393
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:28,800
And a VTuber is literally a false idol.

3394
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:29,820
No, I'm not.

3395
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,180
You're going against the vision of God.

3396
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,420
Oh shit.

3397
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:37,960
And why are you interacting with VTubers?

3398
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:39,620
Oh, I'm a sinner.

3399
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:40,800
Oh, you're a sinner?

3400
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:41,580
Can I get a gladiator?

3401
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,940
You're not going to ask God to forgive you?

3402
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:47,200
Well, right before I die, I ask for forgiveness.

3403
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:52,740
Yeah, so you're collecting... So you're collecting all of it.

3404
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:55,960
Collecting all the sins before you... I'm sin-maxing.

3405
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:56,300
Yeah.

3406
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:02,480
So right before you die, you get a priest over and be like, please God, forgive me.

3407
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:03,800
For I've sinned.

3408
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,580
What if you die before he fully forgives you?

3409
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:10,700
Then I'm stuck in limbo.

3410
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:14,140
Because what if the loading time is too much?

3411
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,440
They send me to the back room.

3412
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,200
The load time?

3413
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:16,640
Yeah.

3414
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,060
The loading time.

3415
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,020
The loading time.

3416
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:21,000
Like, what's the upload down the speed of your prayer?

3417
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:23,980
They probably got a terabyte internet out there.

3418
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:26,780
You think so?

3419
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:29,680
They're closer to the satellites.

3420
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,140
Oh, that's true.

3421
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:32,500
That's true.

3422
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:32,820
That's what it is?

3423
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:34,040
Do they have fiber?

3424
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,280
Is there fiber prayer time?

3425
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,140
But isn't there a queue, though?

3426
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,060
There might be a queue.

3427
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,020
Is there a lot of gladiators?

3428
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:43,820
Yeah, the waiting room.

3429
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:44,960
I got the fast pass.

3430
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:46,520
Yeah, the fast pass.

3431
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,500
How did you get the fast pass?

3432
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,040
Sure, play.

3433
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:50,800
I got a premium.

3434
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:52,880
Oh, yeah.

3435
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,100
Forgive me, premium.

3436
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:57,720
I use my faith points.

3437
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:04,080
Damn, he allocated his faith points into premium.

3438
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,700
Yeah, he maxed out.

3439
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:09,940
Tracking.

3440
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:10,500
Oh, my God.

3441
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:11,300
I see you.

3442
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:12,300
Wait, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac.

3443
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,740
How can I not find a gladiator, dude?

3444
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,260
You can't find one because you're new.

3445
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:16,600
Okay.

3446
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,440
I just want one.

3447
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:19,980
Oh, you're your own dumbass.

3448
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:24,200
Dude, don't talk to yourself like that.

3449
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,180
I have so many smokes.

3450
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:29,780
Good.

3451
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:30,540
Yeah.

3452
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:31,720
Whoa.

3453
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:37,640
Deploying airdrop.

3454
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:40,560
Okay, I can do healing app.

3455
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,120
Are you guys at the juicer juicing it?

3456
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:43,840
I am.

3457
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,280
Oh, I got healing app.

3458
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:49,820
Let's go.

3459
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:51,900
That's good for us.

3460
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,140
Is that the acid shit that when you get hit, you keep getting hit?

3461
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:57,660
Some shit.

3462
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:00,080
Oh, I got first aid and healing app.

3463
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:01,360
Let's go.

3464
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:02,560
I got the support stuff.

3465
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:03,980
There's a care pad coming.

3466
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:06,520
We have a harmonizer because we should go for that.

3467
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:06,800
Hold on.

3468
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,260
I got to go shop as well.

3469
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,460
All right, smoke cover, source strain.

3470
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,120
Okay, maybe I can get the auto charge.

3471
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,480
I'm ready to be a heal bot, guys.

3472
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:18,620
And I got source strain.

3473
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:19,960
You can grab the car and then go for a harmonizer.

3474
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:23,020
Okay, that requires me to defeat an enemy.

3475
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:24,140
I don't think that's useful.

3476
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:24,740
No problem.

3477
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,120
All right, we should head to sure floor.

3478
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:32,780
I mean, we could trade armors if you want.

3479
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,920
I'll take the source strain and shit.

3480
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:34,520
Yeah, sure.

3481
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:35,620
I'll give it to you.

3482
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:36,340
Oh, you can have one.

3483
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,020
I'm going to impact.

3484
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:42,320
All right.

3485
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,900
I thought we're trading here because you stopped.

3486
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:45,700
Yeah, we'll trade.

3487
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:46,100
We'll trade.

3488
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:49,160
We'll trade.

3489
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:49,360
All right.

3490
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:53,460
We'll be crazy.

3491
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:55,540
While we're swapping, we get three, two, one.

3492
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:57,940
Yeah.

3493
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,160
That would be a goddamn tragedy.

3494
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:08,300
He's swerving.

3495
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,140
He's swerving.

3496
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:11,000
It's kind of sick right here.

3497
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:13,740
Yeah, sure.

3498
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,800
For the faith build.

3499
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:16,940
Yeah, he's been doing that since he was born.

3500
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:17,600
He's scammed us.

3501
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:17,940
Wait, wait, wait.

3502
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:18,640
Let's be boy.

3503
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,000
Let's be boy.

3504
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,360
Let's be boy.

3505
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,680
Oh, I fucked up.

3506
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,440
I think he tried.

3507
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:24,820
He tried to scan.

3508
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:26,220
Are we fighting now?

3509
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:26,680
What's going on?

3510
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,480
I can do a portal for sure for him.

3511
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,060
But I don't know if he'll live.

3512
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,340
I need a portal for sure, or are you good?

3513
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:33,840
Yeah, I probably need it.

3514
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,500
I'm not near my car, and I'm scammed.

3515
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:35,940
All right.

3516
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:36,860
And I'm dead.

3517
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:37,420
Get out and drop it.

3518
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:37,960
Get out and drop it.

3519
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:38,460
Get out and drop it.

3520
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:39,180
He's got the shield on him.

3521
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:39,400
Okay.

3522
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:40,900
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

3523
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:41,540
He should be able to take it.

3524
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3525
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:42,480
I got it.

3526
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:43,800
Hold H on it.

3527
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:45,760
I'm holding H from getting thirsty.

3528
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:47,920
I don't think he's...

3529
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:48,400
You got it.

3530
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:48,800
You got it.

3531
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:50,900
Yeah, I have fast res.

3532
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,400
I have fast res.

3533
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:52,880
That was close.

3534
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:53,860
Yeah, that was.

3535
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:55,420
Here.

3536
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:55,940
I'm a crap bomb.

3537
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:56,940
Born again.

3538
01:43:58,800 --> 01:43:59,320
Oh, my God.

3539
01:43:59,400 --> 01:43:59,960
I got shot at.

3540
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,160
Um, what the fuck?

3541
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,080
What the fucky?

3542
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:04,760
We only have one car now?

3543
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:06,660
No, no, we have a car in the smoke.

3544
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:07,500
There's a car in the smoke.

3545
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:07,980
I'm just kidding.

3546
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,540
Wait, oh, okay, so we didn't take that car in the smoke.

3547
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,800
If we get a pick, we should try to kill them.

3548
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:14,360
I almost killed them.

3549
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,740
One of them is on blue armor.

3550
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:18,360
We should kill them before they get this shit because they're gonna have good armors.

3551
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:19,080
Yeah.

3552
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,040
Yeah.

3553
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:23,520
I don't have another res.

3554
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:24,720
One's on earth.

3555
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,560
I think they got it.

3556
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:29,360
That's a gun from the...

3557
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:38,200
We're leaving, we're leaving, we're leaving.

3558
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,440
Yeah, get out, get out, get out, get out.

3559
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:40,880
These guys are sweat loads.

3560
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,980
Can we get a different harmonizer?

3561
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:44,240
I can give a heal to Surefire.

3562
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,000
No, there's only two on the map.

3563
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:47,760
Mac, you good?

3564
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:48,480
I can't talk because I got shot.

3565
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:48,800
I'm gonna wall out around.

3566
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:49,460
Yeah, I'll be fine.

3567
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,880
I walled off our bush.

3568
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:52,100
We're good.

3569
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:53,000
Okay, we have to take...

3570
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,440
There's another car right here.

3571
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:53,860
Yeah.

3572
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:56,720
Um, I can give another heal.

3573
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,220
I'm giving it to Mac.

3574
01:44:58,220 --> 01:44:59,520
They are pushing, they're pushing.

3575
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,800
I'm going to hold this compound.

3576
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,380
I'm in this compound.

3577
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:08,980
Ok, you guys wanna take this car before I...

3578
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:10,240
Ok, I'm...

3579
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:11,620
I knock one, I knock one, I knock one.

3580
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,100
I'm knocked.

3581
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:14,360
I'm knocked.

3582
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:17,220
Oh, RP you need to pick us up.

3583
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:19,500
Uh oh.

3584
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:21,840
They are going to run you over.

3585
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,300
Oh, I hit it.

3586
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,400
Why can't you come back cracked?

3587
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:30,000
I ulted my feet.

3588
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:30,720
I'm dead.

3589
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:31,780
I'm so fucking dead, dude.

3590
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:32,960
There's no way I can see AD.

3591
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:33,360
I'm flashing.

3592
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:36,200
I'm so fucking flashing.

3593
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:38,200
I'm gonna do maximum damage here.

3594
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:39,080
Yeah, we got second red.

3595
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:39,740
We have to die.

3596
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:43,780
Killed one.

3597
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:47,140
Oh, it's Aiden's group again.

3598
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,520
We have second res though.

3599
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:50,600
Yeah, we respawn.

3600
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:52,880
I gripped the shit out of them.

3601
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,460
Well, we also needed to get picked up on the car.

3602
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:58,360
Oh, we're respawning next to them.

3603
01:45:58,680 --> 01:45:59,460
We're respawning next to them.

3604
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:00,320
Go to the Harmonizer.

3605
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,040
Just go to the Harmonizer.

3606
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,200
Oh, I went the wrong way.

3607
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,280
Oh, it didn't change my spawn.

3608
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,180
You didn't need to change it.

3609
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:09,320
You just did change it.

3610
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,500
I changed it, and then I tried to change it back.

3611
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,740
Are they gonna go back to it?

3612
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:14,980
There's a car here.

3613
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:15,880
Wait, where are you?

3614
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,480
I'm gonna take this car.

3615
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,200
You know, if we were four, I would agree with you.

3616
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:22,760
But we're two.

3617
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:24,220
Yeah.

3618
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:28,500
I thought the one that swapped was you, Mac.

3619
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:30,300
That's why...

3620
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,060
I'm driving over.

3621
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,360
Me too.

3622
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,200
You wanna finish this?

3623
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,580
Yeah, I mean, we could try.

3624
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:40,900
I'm driving over too.

3625
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:41,580
Try to finish it.

3626
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:42,320
I got the pumpy.

3627
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:43,420
I got the pumpy.

3628
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,420
I may die.

3629
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,220
I have a bolt-action and auto-shot it.

3630
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:47,160
Because I don't trust myself.

3631
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:48,720
Just go down there and start tapping it.

3632
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:50,040
I'm tapping.

3633
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:50,880
I'm tapping.

3634
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:51,280
I'm tapping.

3635
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:53,080
Oh, I see them coming.

3636
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:54,380
Uh-oh.

3637
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:54,940
Uh-oh.

3638
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:57,580
Are we fighting?

3639
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,100
Maybe.

3640
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,460
If they hit you, they're gonna know you're wide and bloated.

3641
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:03,880
I hit one for 110.

3642
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:05,560
Um...

3643
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,060
We're coming up.

3644
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:07,520
One is driving up with two dudes in it.

3645
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:08,920
Why not?

3646
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:09,360
Yeah.

3647
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:10,300
That car has two in it.

3648
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,080
Are they coming up?

3649
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:14,380
It does as smooth as me.

3650
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:15,020
No, not yet.

3651
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,300
You guys stand in here so it's faster, please.

3652
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:18,160
They're starting to drive up.

3653
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:18,220
No, no, no, no.

3654
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:20,140
I don't have...

3655
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:20,860
I only have a Jackson.

3656
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:22,680
Is there any extra guns?

3657
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:24,140
Can you ping where they're coming from at least?

3658
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:25,040
Up here.

3659
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:26,940
I'm just gonna heal Mac right now.

3660
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,120
Yeah.

3661
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:30,100
Should be good to cap.

3662
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,380
It doesn't look like they're gunning it.

3663
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:32,400
Okay, I did, I did, I did.

3664
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:33,320
Last cap, last cap.

3665
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,600
Time for a grand entrance.

3666
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:37,100
Gen collector.

3667
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:37,680
That's good, right?

3668
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:38,060
What is this?

3669
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:39,200
Yeah, that's good.

3670
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:41,040
That means if some of us die, you run away.

3671
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,960
I'm gonna check the roof for extra guns.

3672
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,380
I also have an ultimate accelerator.

3673
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:46,020
Who needs ult?

3674
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:46,820
I'm a drop ultimate accelerator.

3675
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,360
I think they're playing Sorrowind.

3676
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:48,780
Be careful.

3677
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:49,200
They could...

3678
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,640
They could fly in on a roof.

3679
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:53,200
I'm just trying to get extra guns.

3680
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,840
Yeah, we can go back to our bodies.

3681
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,500
Yeah, let's go back to our bodies after this.

3682
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,080
Just cap this and then go back to our bodies.

3683
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,480
Can someone stand with point with me so it's faster, guys?

3684
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:02,940
It's almost done.

3685
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:03,160
Yeah, yeah.

3686
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:04,000
I'm running down now.

3687
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:06,000
Yeah, I was just trying to rewatch and make sure they don't fly on us.

3688
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:06,980
So yeah, I'm coming over.

3689
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:07,700
I'm coming over here now.

3690
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:08,620
I'm already here.

3691
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:09,160
Yeah, I'm here.

3692
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,140
They went up here.

3693
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:11,540
They're definitely just getting upgrades.

3694
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:12,500
Okay.

3695
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,640
Time to put our plans in motion.

3696
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:16,920
Yippee.

3697
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:22,220
I got gold up, dude.

3698
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,740
Grab that SMG in the TP.

3699
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:24,980
I'll get that emergency shield.

3700
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:25,740
Take in Tempest.

3701
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:26,440
There's a...

3702
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,400
Taking the armor card here.

3703
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:31,660
Who's with me?

3704
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:32,740
Alright.

3705
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:34,180
I'll go with Max.

3706
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:35,600
Okay.

3707
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:36,580
Let's go back to our bodies.

3708
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:38,300
I hope they're still not there, though.

3709
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:39,940
They shouldn't.

3710
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,520
They drove up to the right.

3711
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:42,900
We died like...

3712
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,880
Oh, there's someone here at the compound.

3713
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,320
I used armor.

3714
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:47,900
I think it's a different team.

3715
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:49,380
It is a different team.

3716
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:51,200
We might even be able to kill these guys.

3717
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:54,660
If we can get to our bodies, we can get good armors and kill them, no?

3718
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,940
I can smoke it in three seconds.

3719
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,980
I'm gonna go up the hill and see if I can type them in a second.

3720
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:01,880
Okay.

3721
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:04,500
I'll have a portal if we need it.

3722
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,960
Yeah, I can also put a wall on it.

3723
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,640
I don't have any scope, so like...

3724
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,440
This car is fucked.

3725
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:10,020
This car is fucked.

3726
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,080
They're driving.

3727
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,140
We should kill these guys, bro.

3728
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:16,680
They have sniper.

3729
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:17,060
They have sniper.

3730
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:17,440
They have sniper.

3731
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:17,800
They have sniper.

3732
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:18,840
They don't have white armor.

3733
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:20,880
They don't have white armor.

3734
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:21,680
They don't have white armor.

3735
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:22,300
They don't have white armor.

3736
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:23,220
They don't have white armor.

3737
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:26,100
I really feel like we should take this fight, dude.

3738
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,580
Yeah, I mean, you can try and see if you can get your body.

3739
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:29,620
I'm gonna...

3740
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:31,100
I can't do anything.

3741
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:31,620
I'm going down to the left.

3742
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:33,020
If you have smokes...

3743
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:33,660
Bodies are here.

3744
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:36,320
There's another car driving up on our right.

3745
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:38,340
They're flying.

3746
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:39,060
Did these guys flying?

3747
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,100
No, that's the supply drop.

3748
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,100
Oh, the supply drop, yeah.

3749
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:44,540
There's a car trying to come up on our right.

3750
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:46,700
Are you guys okay over there?

3751
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,960
I almost killed one.

3752
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:49,180
They're out on our right.

3753
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:51,200
They're out on our right.

3754
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,580
I got knocked.

3755
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,600
This is a different team.

3756
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,560
Can you res?

3757
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:58,940
Can you res?

3758
01:49:59,560 --> 01:49:59,840
No.

3759
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:00,960
Car.

3760
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:01,480
For me.

3761
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:04,080
I know I have what.

3762
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:05,380
They're running away.

3763
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:05,760
They're flying away.

3764
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,400
They're flying.

3765
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,420
Aw, my God, bro.

3766
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:07,780
I killed one.

3767
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:09,380
I got a heal.

3768
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:10,640
There's a car on me.

3769
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:11,400
I almost knocked one.

3770
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:13,060
Oh, there's someone behind us.

3771
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:14,120
Car, car, car, car!

3772
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:14,960
Car behind you!

3773
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,000
You're trying to run over.

3774
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:18,400
I'm smoking it.

3775
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:18,820
I'm a slow gun.

3776
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:21,240
He's executing me in the bush!

3777
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:22,580
Oh no.

3778
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:23,500
That's not good.

3779
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:25,880
I almost killed one in this other car.

3780
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,100
Smoke's over.

3781
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:27,660
The first one's over.

3782
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:30,900
One's on the body.

3783
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,520
I'm gonna slow heal.

3784
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:34,900
I just fell.

3785
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:36,940
Yeah, Mac might need help later.

3786
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:38,140
I'm coming.

3787
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:40,420
I'm just...

3788
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:41,840
I've all killed one.

3789
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,440
Oh, in the body.

3790
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:43,560
I killed one in the body.

3791
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,300
Killed one on Shuford's body.

3792
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:47,460
Can I get res?

3793
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,640
Hold on, hold on.

3794
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:50,220
I'm getting him.

3795
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:52,300
He's on top of your car.

3796
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:52,800
Yeah.

3797
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:55,500
They're wrapping us.

3798
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:56,380
Okay.

3799
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:57,020
Come to the side.

3800
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,240
They're going up above us.

3801
01:50:59,320 --> 01:50:59,620
I'm crawling.

3802
01:50:59,860 --> 01:50:59,960
I'm crawling.

3803
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:00,620
I'm crawling.

3804
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:00,860
They are.

3805
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:01,760
Wait.

3806
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:02,760
You can tee me.

3807
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,220
I'm sticking your house.

3808
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:06,500
I'm running through this and spawning him.

3809
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:08,280
Break time's over.

3810
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:09,780
Welcome back to this fight.

3811
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:11,600
RPR, you need to put a wall down on my side.

3812
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:13,040
I don't have wall in 10 seconds.

3813
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,380
I'm getting shot through the wall, bro.

3814
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:18,760
Yeah, they have us on the stand.

3815
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:19,420
Run.

3816
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:19,600
Run.

3817
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:19,720
Run.

3818
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:20,800
You have to run.

3819
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:21,340
You have to run.

3820
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,200
RPR has to run.

3821
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:24,040
RPR has to run.

3822
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:25,020
I do, I do.

3823
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:26,000
Yeah, just run.

3824
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:26,340
Run, run.

3825
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:27,080
Just get out.

3826
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:28,460
You'll be able to grab all of us.

3827
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:30,900
I don't have much heals.

3828
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:34,200
They might try to drive.

3829
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:34,460
Just hide.

3830
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:35,180
Hide in the bush.

3831
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:35,680
Hide in the bush.

3832
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:37,040
Dude, prone.

3833
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:38,900
In the bush.

3834
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:40,580
Z in the bush.

3835
01:51:40,580 --> 01:51:41,280
Z in the bush.

3836
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:42,000
Do I heal?

3837
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,380
Do I heal?

3838
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:42,700
Do I heal?

3839
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,600
They might use the lipstick, though.

3840
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,660
They're just looting our dead bodies.

3841
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:54,600
They might just, like, uh, throw the lipstick, though.

3842
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:55,940
Do you have enough heals, though, for this?

3843
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:56,680
No.

3844
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:57,620
Definitely not.

3845
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,940
Can I grab it from here with gem collector?

3846
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:01,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3847
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:02,440
Just pop it.

3848
01:52:03,860 --> 01:52:04,620
So who do I get?

3849
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:05,860
It works.

3850
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,480
It's a whole team.

3851
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:09,400
We all have heals on our boxes, so it's fine.

3852
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:11,480
Oh, you're grabbing me right now.

3853
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:14,800
You gonna spawn me?

3854
01:52:19,110 --> 01:52:20,930
You have meds, like, to begin with, right?

3855
01:52:21,630 --> 01:52:22,690
You said you just have a lot.

3856
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:23,070
That's it.

3857
01:52:23,310 --> 01:52:23,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3858
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:23,870
We'll be fine.

3859
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:24,750
We can get up to the bodies.

3860
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:26,450
And there's also bodies down there.

3861
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:27,250
Yeah.

3862
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:30,750
I'm gonna go grab a car.

3863
01:52:31,790 --> 01:52:33,970
I still hit a car by the bodies, by the way.

3864
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:38,650
The first team might have came back and grabbed the guy's banner that I killed.

3865
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:40,830
How much meds do you have left, though?

3866
01:52:41,690 --> 01:52:42,330
Two meds.

3867
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:44,730
Oh, you have to go now, then, or you're gonna die in the storm.

3868
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:44,910
Yeah, I do.

3869
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:50,690
And then Matt can grab the meds on our old bodies.

3870
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:52,930
Yeah, that's just our old...

3871
01:52:52,930 --> 01:52:53,690
Oh, there's people here.

3872
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:57,010
There's a guy healing in the storm here.

3873
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:57,850
You have to heal, you have to heal.

3874
01:52:57,850 --> 01:52:59,010
100 out of 10.

3875
01:52:59,950 --> 01:53:01,110
I'm gonna add this on too, bro.

3876
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:03,630
My last heal.

3877
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:05,530
I jumped into that car.

3878
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:07,910
I'm just dead.

3879
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:09,810
I just have no heals.

3880
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:12,990
There's no heals on any of these bodies, dude.

3881
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:14,570
No, they took all the heals.

3882
01:53:15,390 --> 01:53:17,910
I spawned and it said I had 9 heals.

3883
01:53:18,970 --> 01:53:19,810
That's so weird.

3884
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:25,010
Dude, I spawned and it said I had 9 heals, but then I had 2.

3885
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:26,830
Why aren't these guys still here?

3886
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:28,250
I don't know.

3887
01:53:28,410 --> 01:53:29,070
What are they doing?

3888
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:30,370
I think they absorbed all our...

3889
01:53:30,370 --> 01:53:30,750
I think they were rezzing.

3890
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:33,010
Yeah, they absorbed all our heals.

3891
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:37,310
I kind of got fucked up when I was trying to scan and then the car left me.

3892
01:53:37,810 --> 01:53:40,290
I shouldn't have jumped out of the car with a scan.

3893
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:41,690
Yeah.

3894
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:48,890
I don't think it does.

3895
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:51,670
I tried scanning through the window once and it wouldn't let me.

3896
01:53:52,210 --> 01:53:53,190
These guys are so dead.

3897
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:54,610
The guy, nope, couldn't get arrested.

3898
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:55,170
He's dead.

3899
01:53:55,950 --> 01:53:57,210
I mean, all of them lived.

3900
01:53:57,370 --> 01:53:57,670
Oh, wait.

3901
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:58,030
He's dead.

3902
01:53:58,090 --> 01:53:58,510
Never mind.

3903
01:53:58,510 --> 01:53:58,830
He's dead.

3904
01:54:00,190 --> 01:54:02,550
Like on my screen, it doesn't show him dead.

3905
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:03,390
On the...

3906
01:54:03,390 --> 01:54:04,610
I mean on the like the...

3907
01:54:04,610 --> 01:54:05,550
the team thing.

3908
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:06,170
You know what?

3909
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:07,770
They're gonna die for doing that.

3910
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:08,790
Look!

3911
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:09,570
He's stuck in car!

3912
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:10,490
Car's stuck!

3913
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:11,410
Car's stuck!

3914
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:12,610
Oh yeah!

3915
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:13,590
It's worth it!

3916
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:14,650
You know what?

3917
01:54:14,670 --> 01:54:16,490
That's what they get for camping us out.

3918
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:19,790
That's what they get.

3919
01:54:21,090 --> 01:54:22,130
Oh, they're cooked.

3920
01:54:22,610 --> 01:54:23,110
What are they gonna do?

3921
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:23,410
Yeah.

3922
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:23,630
Yeah.

3923
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:24,790
There's only one...

3924
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:24,970
Yeah.

3925
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:27,030
The last rat is just gonna rat.

3926
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:28,050
That's the rat.

3927
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:29,470
That's what they get for camping our bodies.

3928
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:29,990
Oh!

3929
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:31,290
Oh!

3930
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:32,110
He got smoked!

3931
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:33,590
He got smoked!

3932
01:54:34,230 --> 01:54:35,250
That's what they get!

3933
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:36,050
Karma!

3934
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:37,610
Actual karma!

3935
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:45,100
Dessert.

3936
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:47,300
I don't think...

3937
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:47,820
Guys, I don't know.

3938
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:50,020
I don't think we made it to the top five...

3939
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,240
Guys, I don't think we're top six.

3940
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,160
I don't think so.

3941
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:54,600
It's okay.

3942
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:55,540
You can blame me.

3943
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:59,020
I think fuck we can blame him, dude.

3944
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,360
Yeah, thank fuck, guys.

3945
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:01,380
I'll take it.

3946
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:02,200
Yeah.

3947
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:03,800
You'll take it.

3948
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:07,280
Maybe they'll give us a...

3949
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:07,960
Maybe...

3950
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:11,120
They're like, we gotta put this team in because they're the sponsored team.

3951
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:13,200
I don't think they're gonna do that.

3952
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:13,800
Wait, we got...

3953
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,380
How many kills did I have?

3954
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:15,940
Zero.

3955
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:17,580
I think I have two.

3956
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:18,700
I don't know how to say it.

3957
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:19,320
You had one.

3958
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,140
You pressed base bar.

3959
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:20,700
You can't see mine.

3960
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:22,380
You had four knocks.

3961
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:23,140
Only one kill, though.

3962
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:24,740
You had two...

3963
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:25,340
Two kills.

3964
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:26,960
Two kills and...

3965
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:27,720
It backed me out of the game.

3966
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:28,980
We got nine points for this game.

3967
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:31,020
I was crawling on the ground simulator.

3968
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:32,960
I don't think...

3969
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:33,920
I don't think...

3970
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:34,880
That guy just got three, two, one.

3971
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:35,560
Yeah.

3972
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:36,620
That's fucked.

3973
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,720
Which puts us at 46 points.

3974
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:39,640
Which...

3975
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,760
I don't think we made it.

3976
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:42,300
The teams below what the cutoff was before.

3977
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:42,780
Because, like, the...

3978
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:43,600
The teams below us...

3979
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:46,360
The teams below us were very close to catching up to us.

3980
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,940
They literally just had the...

3981
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:48,800
Placement points.

3982
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:51,980
And that...

3983
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:52,760
Jesus Christ!

3984
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:53,580
What the...

3985
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:53,820
Yeah!

3986
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:56,340
I was gonna say, what the fuck are they doing?

3987
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:56,980
Bro, look...

3988
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:58,000
Look, these guys are just running people over.

3989
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:58,840
They're just running people over.

3990
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,580
Why didn't we run people over?

3991
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:02,260
Why were we the ones that get run over?

3992
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:05,600
Because we were the ones always getting pushed.

3993
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:07,080
Except in the first game.

3994
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,220
They should make it in this game.

3995
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:14,220
So if you get run over under, like, 80 kilometers an hour, you do not take damage.

3996
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,480
Yeah, you can kind of just, like...

3997
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:17,080
I don't think that's real life.

3998
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,820
Pace and still run people over.

3999
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:20,240
Yeah, you can run...

4000
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:21,840
You can do 20 kilometer hours...

4001
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:22,480
Instamox.

4002
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:28,140
It's kind of nuts.

4003
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:29,820
That's crazy.

4004
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:34,920
You just go armored car, hit your armor ability, and just point, point, point.

4005
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:35,880
Play...

4006
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:36,800
Falling with them.

4007
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:37,360
Yeah.

4008
01:56:42,590 --> 01:56:45,110
I definitely should not have peeked the...

4009
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:47,210
Them when they first drove up to us.

4010
01:56:48,370 --> 01:56:49,610
I got gunned down.

4011
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:50,590
Then I reset.

4012
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:53,230
And then I got shot from three different directions.

4013
01:56:53,710 --> 01:56:56,090
I just got shot at with my white army.

4014
01:56:56,090 --> 01:56:57,830
Oh, these guys are a different zone, aren't they?

4015
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:01,290
Also, like, we kept bumping into Aiden's team, too.

4016
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:02,370
Or Aiden's team.

4017
01:57:03,470 --> 01:57:03,750
Yeah.

4018
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:04,470
Well, yeah.

4019
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:06,010
It's because we fought them at the start.

4020
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,630
Wait.

4021
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:08,650
And didn't...

4022
01:57:08,650 --> 01:57:09,130
And didn't...

4023
01:57:09,130 --> 01:57:11,210
Didn't Mac invite that item, too?

4024
01:57:11,530 --> 01:57:12,200
So, like, you literally...

4025
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:13,570
So you...

4026
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:17,090
So you invited him, just so we could die.

4027
01:57:18,250 --> 01:57:20,730
Because they weren't originally in the tournament.

4028
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:22,970
In the official tournament roster.

4029
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:25,350
You did this post.

4030
01:57:25,390 --> 01:57:26,110
That's my bad.

4031
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:28,270
I should've taken off my belt.

4032
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:32,350
I can't believe it.

4033
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:34,450
Mac invited him just for...

4034
01:57:34,450 --> 01:57:36,150
Just for him to kill us.

4035
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:40,230
There is an imposter among us.

4036
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:41,910
I'm a fucking double agent.

4037
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:43,110
Yeah, the double agent.

4038
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:44,270
He wanted...

4039
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:45,330
He rather...

4040
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:46,190
You're actually grieving.

4041
01:57:46,190 --> 01:57:48,010
You know, you could've made money.

4042
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:55,920
Look, they're alive again.

4043
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:59,160
This is your fault.

4044
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:00,360
No respect to them.

4045
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:01,960
Look, see, they're alive.

4046
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:02,700
No, it's my freaking fault.

4047
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:03,600
There's your friend.

4048
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:04,980
Mac, there's your friend.

4049
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:05,580
Yeah, sure.

4050
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:06,620
You don't even know him.

4051
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:07,600
It's my freaking fault.

4052
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:08,340
Wait, wait.

4053
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:10,020
They're in first.

4054
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:12,080
It's actually good if they soak up all the points.

4055
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:13,320
It is, yeah.

4056
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:13,980
We might make it.

4057
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:15,500
Are you sure?

4058
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:16,940
Yeah, yeah.

4059
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:18,220
If they soak up the points...

4060
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:19,060
Yeah, no, but I meant like...

4061
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:20,680
The teams below us, I think...

4062
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:21,820
Have placements.

4063
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:24,580
Yeah, but if they kill everyone and they win, it might be doable.

4064
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:28,400
I wish I could see.

4065
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:32,240
I didn't say it was gonna be comfortable, but we might make it.

4066
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:34,680
For sure I just crashed.

4067
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,840
You just crashed?

4068
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:38,500
I mean...

4069
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:38,700
I...

4070
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:39,540
I...

4071
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:40,540
I feel like we're gonna...

4072
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:41,140
Okay.

4073
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,700
I feel like we're gonna like...

4074
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:44,180
Lose by one point.

4075
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:45,180
Judging our luck.

4076
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:49,780
Can I like get back in?

4077
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:51,160
You know, probably not.

4078
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:51,460
Yeah.

4079
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:53,140
Why did they put Aiden and Vayne together?

4080
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:54,080
Wait, that's fucked.

4081
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:56,840
Yeah, they signed up as a team.

4082
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:57,300
That's...

4083
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:57,620
That's fucked.

4084
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:58,880
The initial team...

4085
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,920
And you invited both of them too!

4086
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:02,100
The initial team?

4087
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:02,480
Okay, okay.

4088
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:04,800
The team I invited, it actually would've been way worse.

4089
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,760
It was supposed to be Frex, Vayne, Aiden, and Solve.

4090
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:10,360
You invited both of these players!

4091
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:12,920
That's in the first place!

4092
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,580
I can't believe you've done this!

4093
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:18,600
Yeah, I can't believe you've done this!

4094
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:20,820
You did this to us!

4095
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:23,320
I just wanted to be known, Doki invited me.

4096
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:24,020
So...

4097
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:25,120
Thank you for your Doki!

4098
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:28,300
I had a sponsor opportunity!

4099
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:29,320
I can't believe you've done that, Doki!

4100
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:29,660
I had a...

4101
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:30,500
They were like...

4102
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:41,460
I can't believe you've done this!

4103
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:42,860
Oh!

4104
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:44,660
Why didn't you suggest a fourth player?

4105
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,560
You two could've suggested a fourth player!

4106
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:47,220
You guys didn't!

4107
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:48,200
I was never asked!

4108
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:48,940
You're literally captain!

4109
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,500
You're literally captain, RPR!

4110
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:51,800
I was never asked!

4111
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,060
I was never asked!

4112
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:52,940
Guys, we're a team.

4113
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:54,120
We need to stop fighting.

4114
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:54,680
Yeah.

4115
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:55,720
It's all Surefour's fault!

4116
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:56,700
The game's over!

4117
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:58,220
Yeah, it's my fault.

4118
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:00,620
It's all his fault!

4119
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:01,360
I agree.

4120
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:02,120
You're right.

4121
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:04,020
Yeah, in the end it was Surefour's fault.

4122
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,140
I should've been freaking stronger.

4123
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,380
You should've...

4124
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:08,600
Why did you get out of the car, Surefour?

4125
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,400
Because I wanted to scan.

4126
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:13,100
And then I got gunned down.

4127
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:17,640
I mean, I looked it and it didn't look like there was a yellow beam and they baited us.

4128
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:20,200
Yeah, they activated it as we pulled out.

4129
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:21,240
Yeah, they activated it, yeah.

4130
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:23,060
That's why Mac and I drove off.

4131
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:24,800
I think we got timing.

4132
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:27,580
Yeah, which team won?

4133
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,800
I can't believe we got timing when we were baited.

4134
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:34,260
I wish we could see the leader board, like the... what placement each person got.

4135
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:36,160
Yeah.

4136
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:38,420
I had 97 damage.

4137
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,040
I got MEP in our team.

4138
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:42,080
Well, I can report you.

4139
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:42,760
Congrats, bro.

4140
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:44,060
I can report Mac.

4141
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:45,700
What the?

4142
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:48,120
Report Doki for InstaCode.

4143
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:52,680
I should report SureFor it, because we're all blaming him, right?

4144
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:54,180
Yeah, yeah.

4145
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:55,600
Yeah.

4146
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:57,520
It was 100% SureFor's fault.

4147
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:57,860
Yeah.

4148
02:00:58,340 --> 02:00:59,880
Why weren't you stronger?

4149
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:01,560
I don't know.

4150
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,440
I didn't have enough Jesus points stacked.

4151
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:09,300
I didn't use your faith points to help us.

4152
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:12,780
I need to save them from when I die.

4153
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:17,160
Right before you die, or else you can't be forgiven.

4154
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,120
Maybe God has gotcha up there.

4155
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:23,620
Get 20 pulls.

4156
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:25,540
What would your pulls be?

4157
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:30,160
Like, what kind of angels are around you?

4158
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:30,760
What kind of angels?

4159
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:33,640
Yeah, he gets to pick his wings, bro.

4160
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:34,460
And his halo.

4161
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:36,880
How do we find out if we're clankers or not?

4162
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:38,940
Um...

4163
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:41,400
They post the results, like, soon.

4164
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:43,000
I mean, they have to calculate it.

4165
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:44,960
Chat.

4166
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,020
What were the...

4167
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:48,600
Do you guys know who were the last top five teams?

4168
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:49,280
Then we'll know.

4169
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,260
Like, the...

4170
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:51,040
Vayne got second.

4171
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:52,340
Yeah, who was first?

4172
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:53,860
Who was the team that got first, guys?

4173
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:55,180
In the last game.

4174
02:01:55,180 --> 02:01:57,160
Hopefully the team that's in front of us, not behind us.

4175
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:58,360
Yeah, hopefully.

4176
02:01:58,700 --> 02:01:59,200
I don't know.

4177
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:02,820
Yeah, I'm pulling for five-star SSR Zachariah.

4178
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:07,040
What the fuck he said, Dom Dom?

4179
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:08,100
I don't know what he said.

4180
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:10,180
I wasn't paying attention.

4181
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:12,600
Oh, I just rolled for Moses.

4182
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,600
Someone was like, the one with Iden.

4183
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:15,340
That's me!

4184
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:16,760
You should roll for Jesus, bro.

4185
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:18,820
Not for Moses.

4186
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:20,160
You can't roll for Jesus, bro.

4187
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:21,020
Why can't he?

4188
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:24,380
Isn't Jesus SSR?

4189
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:28,800
No, Jesus is, like, the announcer of, like, the game.

4190
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:29,680
You don't roll for them.

4191
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:30,620
They're, like, the main character.

4192
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:31,520
Wait, then what's God?

4193
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:34,080
God's, like, the creator.

4194
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:35,440
The cre...

4195
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:36,180
Oh, he's the dev?

4196
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:37,340
Oh, he's the dev.

4197
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:39,420
Will I still be, Camille?

4198
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:40,440
So, God's the dev.

4199
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:40,660
Oh, shit.

4200
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:43,940
Jesus is, like, the announcer.

4201
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:45,260
Then what about, like...

4202
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:46,360
Then what can you roll for?

4203
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:48,040
Apostles, I guess.

4204
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:49,280
Like, the people that die.

4205
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:50,220
The angels, the saints.

4206
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:52,160
Wait, does that mean we can roll for Surefour?

4207
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:53,200
Lucifer.

4208
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:53,860
Roll for SSR Lucifer.

4209
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:55,220
You can roll for Lucifer?

4210
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:56,620
Like, the commons would be...

4211
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:58,300
The commons would be, like...

4212
02:02:58,300 --> 02:02:59,380
Like, Surefour in them.

4213
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:02,000
There's usually, like, darker shadow types in gotchas.

4214
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,220
So, like, Lucifer fix it.

4215
02:03:07,620 --> 02:03:09,260
Jokey can only learn about the Bible.

4216
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,660
I know about the Bible.

4217
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:11,860
And then there's, like...

4218
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:12,640
Then there's also, like...

4219
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:13,220
The...

4220
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,520
The holy version of Lucifer before the falling.

4221
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:16,520
Yeah?

4222
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:17,520
How so?

4223
02:03:17,860 --> 02:03:18,080
Yeah.

4224
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,660
Well, Lucifer is a fallen angel.

4225
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:23,540
Oh, is it would be, like, a different skin or, like, a different character?

4226
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:24,140
Yeah, yeah.

4227
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:24,720
Just different character?

4228
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:25,260
Do you like that?

4229
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:26,420
Like, like...

4230
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:27,460
Yeah, like, you know.

4231
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:28,960
The cosmetics.

4232
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:31,300
It's a chroma.

4233
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:31,780
It's a chroma.

4234
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:31,980
It's a chroma dude.

4235
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:33,340
Hey.

4236
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:35,100
What happened?

4237
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:37,900
Is it blasphemous to make a gotcha based off of the Bible?

4238
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:39,280
Yeah.

4239
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:39,640
Maybe.

4240
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:40,540
Is that?

4241
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:42,960
I feel like you can make so much money off of that.

4242
02:03:43,780 --> 02:03:45,000
Like, if you have no morals.

4243
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:46,840
Because you're making money off of it.

4244
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:47,660
Yeah.

4245
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,200
Is it blasphemous if, like, a priest makes it?

4246
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:50,880
What if a priest got in the game dev?

4247
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:52,660
Wait, who owns the Bible?

4248
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:55,460
Like, you know, like, the Bible's...

4249
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:57,240
Who wrote this?

4250
02:03:57,620 --> 02:03:57,740
What?

4251
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:58,840
The Bible's not?

4252
02:03:59,120 --> 02:03:59,320
No.

4253
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:02,480
Like, currently, like, because, like, the Bible is like the...

4254
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:03,280
The...

4255
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:03,680
It's open source.

4256
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:08,080
Yeah, but, like, where does the profit of the Bible goes to?

4257
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:10,640
The profits of the Bible?

4258
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:11,080
Yeah.

4259
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:13,540
Because, like, the Bible is...

4260
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,060
You're asking questions.

4261
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,480
Does this go straight to the Vatican?

4262
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:21,480
Like, does the Pope earn from the sales of the Bible?

4263
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:26,040
I just want to know.

4264
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:29,820
People have to pay for the bible.

4265
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:33,860
There's no royalties in heaven.

4266
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:38,620
They don't use... There are royalties in heaven.

4267
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:39,940
You have to pay tithe.

4268
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:42,980
Hey, we got it.

4269
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:45,460
This guy doesn't know what a tithe is.

4270
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:48,720
I don't want to know.

4271
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:50,520
I'm not going to heaven anyway.

4272
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:51,580
How do you know that?

4273
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:52,940
Just ask to be forgiven.

4274
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:54,420
I just know I ain't.

4275
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:54,960
You don't know that.

4276
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:56,080
I don't want to be forgiven.

4277
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:56,740
Ask to be forgiven.

4278
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:58,080
Store up your faith points.

4279
02:04:58,360 --> 02:04:58,700
Why not?

4280
02:04:58,960 --> 02:04:58,960
I don't want to be forgiven.

4281
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:00,800
God is inside of everyone.

4282
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:01,200
Yeah.

4283
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:02,020
You just have to let him in.

4284
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:04,920
I'm not letting him inside me.

4285
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:06,620
They're prostrating themselves for Jesus.

4286
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:09,660
But you let Surefour inside of you.

4287
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:11,820
So why can't you let God inside of you?

4288
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:12,360
Huh?

4289
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:12,960
Huh?

4290
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:16,280
Remember when you were like Surefour is inside me?

4291
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:17,140
You said that.

4292
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:19,900
I didn't say that.

4293
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:20,840
I didn't say that.

4294
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:21,360
Guys, clip it.

4295
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:22,440
I remember that.

4296
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:24,460
I do not remember what you were saying.

4297
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:28,140
I remember that because it was turned to hell house.

4298
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:30,100
When we were all getting shot at.

4299
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:33,820
See, my chat remembers.

4300
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:36,620
This is what you're focusing on instead of killing the enemy.

4301
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:40,260
I was pressing and healing all of you.

4302
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:40,260
No.

4303
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:41,660
What do you mean?

4304
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:42,480
This is what we lost.

4305
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:45,660
I made so many portals to fucking save your asses.

4306
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:48,500
I died for the same people every time.

4307
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:52,100
Yeah, the vein spot that Mack invited.

4308
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:57,360
I was just crawling on ground simulator.

4309
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:03,820
So when do we know when we lost?

4310
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:05,140
We got told to back up.

4311
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:06,340
Me and fucking...

4312
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:07,300
I think like, remember when we...

4313
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:10,740
Hiding behind a tree as RPR can just pick us up in a car and he drives away.

4314
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:13,160
And we just get fucking off aimed with three different people.

4315
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:15,340
What happened to us like positioning?

4316
02:06:15,580 --> 02:06:16,940
Why were we just running at people?

4317
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:17,800
I'm sorry.

4318
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:23,120
I didn't know that my teammate with the car seeing his two people out in the open as they're getting pushed would need to say hey.

4319
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:24,600
I didn't see you guys.

4320
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:26,080
I was getting shot, man.

4321
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:30,480
Yeah, just like you didn't see Avarelli's icon when you fucking mag dumped his car.

4322
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:31,120
I didn't.

4323
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:32,380
I smoked him though.

4324
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:34,280
He got fucking cooked, bro.

4325
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:36,260
No, but like...

4326
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:36,720
Sure, for your...

4327
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:37,940
Actually, I blame RPR.

4328
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:39,000
This guy's a third agent.

4329
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:42,060
You guys should've said...

4330
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:46,540
Actually, I remember when we were in that one place we always drop at, I saw him vent.

4331
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:50,780
You know, that's good enough for me.

4332
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:51,620
Let's vote him off.

4333
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:56,220
This guy sends himself and Doki to a dead fucking island on the fucking beam.

4334
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:59,340
Then he fucking blames me.

4335
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:03,860
And Avarelli invites a fucking enemy to the fucking tournament that kills us four times.

4336
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:04,720
And it's my fault.

4337
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:06,240
It is your fault.

4338
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:08,560
You are the captain RPR.

4339
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:10,520
Hey, put your hand up if you're European.

4340
02:07:11,740 --> 02:07:13,060
Oh, not putting my hand up.

4341
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:16,300
Hey, Canada came from Europe, bro.

4342
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:17,800
You got European roots?

4343
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:19,380
No, I don't.

4344
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:20,440
I definitely do not.

4345
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:20,840
We made you.

4346
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,400
I definitely don't have European roots.

4347
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:27,620
We made you guys.

4348
02:07:28,820 --> 02:07:28,960
Okay.

4349
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:31,740
You're not even part of the Europe that made Canada.

4350
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:36,380
You're not even part of that Europe.

4351
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,680
You're so far from the UK.

4352
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:42,780
You're literally is an ocean dividing you.

4353
02:07:42,980 --> 02:07:43,800
I'm closer than you.

4354
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,360
You have an ocean dividing you.

4355
02:07:45,380 --> 02:07:46,440
What breed are you again?

4356
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:51,960
I can report him and he gets banned and all that.

4357
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:53,560
You're saying we like your French.

4358
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:58,560
Don't ever call me French again in life.

4359
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:02,520
Damn.

4360
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:06,940
You're literally closer to France than you are to the UK.

4361
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:13,160
It's about the same.

4362
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:16,220
That's not the same.

4363
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:17,640
There's literally an ocean dividing.

4364
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:18,680
What do you know about geography?

4365
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:19,820
What do you know about geography?

4366
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,440
I know that UK is an island.

4367
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:22,980
Huh?

4368
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:23,920
Yeah.

4369
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:25,220
It's a giant ass island.

4370
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:26,000
UK is an island?

4371
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:26,340
Yes.

4372
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,520
It's surrounded by...

4373
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:29,340
Okay, Mac, you're fucking...

4374
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:31,760
No, it's surrounded by the ocean.

4375
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:31,840
It's surrounded by the ocean.

4376
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:32,500
Wait, am I?

4377
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:34,380
What are you...

4378
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,080
Wait, no.

4379
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:36,700
You didn't know that?

4380
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:39,120
It's literally a fucking...

4381
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:40,900
Well, let me know what you know.

4382
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:41,700
Hey.

4383
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:45,020
Actually, we all came from this thing.

4384
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:45,880
What do you know about Europe, Mac?

4385
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:49,200
Actually, we all came from the same place because of Pangea.

4386
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:53,240
That's the only parts of Europe that I know is the Nordic parts.

4387
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:56,060
We're all from Pangaea before the Reckoning.

4388
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:01,100
Let's listen about Max's Europe knowledge.

4389
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:06,640
Do you think Jesus was more of like a velociraptor when he first spawned?

4390
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:09,980
Guys, we don't have to show up for day two, guys.

4391
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:10,660
We're freed.

4392
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:13,320
Do you think dinosaurs had their own Jesus?

4393
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:14,900
Oh, we missed it by five.

4394
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:16,260
Yeah, we missed it by five.

4395
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:17,280
At least it was at one point.

4396
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:21,520
Did you know that T-Rexes had like a two-kilometer vision and they were completely silent?

4397
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:24,900
So you could be getting stalked by a T-Rex for like hours, not even known.

4398
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:26,200
Then it could just be right behind you.

4399
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:27,200
Damn.

4400
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:28,380
Well, how do you know that?

4401
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:30,200
Were humans even alive back then?

4402
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:31,520
I found that out because of TikTok.

4403
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:33,480
Oh, you believe?

4404
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:34,140
How did they know that?

4405
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:37,000
Yeah, I was going to say, you just believe random TikTok videos?

4406
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:38,840
It's like, I just learned this from YouTube short.

4407
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:40,780
Do you think people would go on the internet and just lie?

4408
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:42,900
I mean, RPR is here.

4409
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:43,960
I mean, look at Linkster, bro.

4410
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:45,780
That guy lies 247, dude.

4411
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:49,220
Who would make fake educational problems?

4412
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:52,960
He's a whole ass fanboy.

4413
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:54,680
That's true.

4414
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,020
Wait, are you trying to say fanboys lie?

4415
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:00,200
No, you're saying that particular fanboy.

4416
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:01,180
I'm not a fucking fanboy, dude.

4417
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:02,700
There you are.

4418
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:04,300
Yeah, but you've been a fanboy in VR chat.

4419
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:04,480
Definitely are.

4420
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:05,620
I've seen you in the maid outfit.

4421
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:07,500
I'm not a fucking fanboy.

4422
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:07,580
Oh, true!

4423
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:10,140
You've cosplayed more as women characters than men.

4424
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:13,740
And I was the manliest maid ever made.

4425
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:14,700
Like, what do we want about it?

4426
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:14,820
Wait, question.

4427
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:16,680
Have you ever worn thigh highs, RPR?

4428
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:17,160
Yeah.

4429
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:19,000
No.

4430
02:10:19,700 --> 02:10:20,260
Don't lie.

4431
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:21,280
He had to think about it.

4432
02:10:21,620 --> 02:10:22,200
Yeah, yeah, no.

4433
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:23,200
He had to think about it.

4434
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:23,960
It wasn't, yeah.

4435
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:25,560
He had to think about it.

4436
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:28,120
No, I was fucking hitting my vape.

4437
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:29,140
Femboy.

4438
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:31,240
You were hitting your vape.

4439
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:33,140
I'm sure you were.

4440
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:34,800
Yeah, I need to calm down when I talk to you guys.

4441
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:40,400
You could have changed teams.

4442
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:48,840
The staff were like, are you okay with playing with X and X person?

4443
02:10:49,060 --> 02:10:50,560
And then you could have said no.

4444
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:54,340
No, they literally told me this is your team and I said aight.

4445
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:55,140
Wait, really?

4446
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:58,560
They were like, do you want to play with the RPR and Sherpaugh?

4447
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:01,060
I was like, yeah, this is gonna be your team.

4448
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:02,520
And I was like, aight.

4449
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:04,140
Damn, and you're the captain.

4450
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:05,680
You saw the RPR on the list and you were just like, fuck.

4451
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:08,740
I was like, fuck hell, man.

4452
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:13,240
I feel like I was like, I feel like I was the only one that like, got asked about my opinion.

4453
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:16,860
Yeah, and it's my fucking team, apparently.

4454
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:18,980
Yeah, you're the captain.

4455
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,820
How am I the captain?

4456
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:22,340
I didn't do fucking shit, dude.

4457
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:23,860
I'm the captain.

4458
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:26,380
I didn't do anything, dude.

4459
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,300
How am I the captain?

4460
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:30,120
Oh yeah, Vayne got 115 points.

4461
02:11:30,420 --> 02:11:31,180
Thanks, Mac.

4462
02:11:34,120 --> 02:11:34,840
That's good.

4463
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:35,560
That was my bad.

4464
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:40,700
Yeah, they almost went in with an actual killing squad, too.

4465
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:42,820
Well, we don't have to go tomorrow.

4466
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:46,020
Alright, GG's, guys.

4467
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:46,820
It was fun.

4468
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:53,220
Yeah, also, guys, just so you guys remember, you can download the link.

4469
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:55,320
Not download, you can wishlist this game.

4470
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,360
Yeah, you can wishlist this game.

4471
02:11:57,440 --> 02:11:59,320
Clicking the link in the penned message.

4472
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:04,120
You can also go store, and then type fate trigger, and then go...

And if you watched our stream, you guys might have got keys to play the game yourself.

4475
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:17,160
Because look, the friendship in this group has never been so strong before.

4476
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:19,240
Wait, wait, we should all gift each other.

4477
02:12:19,740 --> 02:12:22,160
Oh, yo, check my code, guys.

4478
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:23,520
No, no, no.

4479
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:24,220
Use my code.

4480
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:28,100
Guys, use my code right here.

4481
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:30,300
What the fuck is a holographic rose?

4482
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:31,760
She's being assaulted.

4483
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:35,640
I don't have one.

4484
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:36,180
I'm a loser.

4485
02:12:37,180 --> 02:12:38,360
What you don't have?

4486
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:40,400
A holographic rose.

4487
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:42,540
What's a holographic rose?

4488
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:43,520
I don't know.

4489
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:44,600
You can give people...

4490
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:45,380
Wait, really?

4491
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:46,200
Roses in this game.

4492
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:47,480
Oh, so that's what it was.

4493
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:48,280
Wait, how do you...

4494
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:49,580
You can marry people in this game.

4495
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:51,020
Wait, marry like the...

4496
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:51,140

The characters that we have?

4498
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:54,060
No, your friends.

4499
02:12:54,440 --> 02:12:55,300
Wait, what?

4500
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:55,520

4501
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,160
Yeah, click on the friends list.

4502
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:58,400
What?

4503
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:01,720
Will there be like a wedding ceremony?

4504
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:03,480
No, click on the friend thing.

4505
02:13:03,780 --> 02:13:04,080

And then like click on any of your friends.

4507
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:09,800
Wait, why are you guys offline?

4508
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:11,600
I closed the game.

4509
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:12,980
I might have closed the game.

4510
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:13,520
Oh, okay.

4511
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:14,660
Just click on anyone.

4512
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:15,460
Just click on anyone.

4513
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:15,600
Okay.

4514
02:13:16,620 --> 02:13:17,040
Close...

4515
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:18,360
Oh, there's...

4516
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:19,940
That's the tournament organizer.

4517
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:22,200
And then you can gift them roses.

4518
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:24,260
And then there's...

4519
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:25,360
Wait, there's bonds.

02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:27,880
Yeah, and then...

4522
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:28,120
You increase your bond.

4523
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:30,020
I forget where the other page is.

4524
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:32,040
There's another page where you can like marry someone.

4525
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:33,220
Wait, what?

4526
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,580
Yeah.

4527
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:34,940
What?

02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:36,240
Oh, it's the connection.

4529
02:13:36,380 --> 02:13:38,780
There's soulmate, close friend, and partner.

4530
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:39,160
Yeah, soulmate.

4531
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:40,100
There you go.

4532
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:41,520
You can have one soulmate.

Yeah.

4534
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:43,540
What the fuck?

4535
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:44,560
We got five partners?

4536
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:45,420
What the hell?

4537
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:46,860
Yo, polygamy.

4538
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:51,280
Wait, but like what are the benefits of having a soulmate?

4539
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:53,800
You get trial points.

4540
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:56,160
But like, what does that mean?

4541
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,600
It's points for...

4542
02:13:58,600 --> 02:13:59,280
Oh my god.

4543
02:13:59,280 --> 02:13:59,880
Oh, it's for the rolls?

4544
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:02,760
This game is gonna be the next e-dating mess.

4545
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:03,860
Oh, is it for rolls?

4546
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:08,180
Guys, if you find your soulmate, you get to have more points for gacha.

4547
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:09,800
Really?

4548

Guys, it's all...

4549
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,820
Do it for your anime waifus.

4550
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:18,940
Find your soulmate.

4551
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:21,400
That's crazy.

4552
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:23,340
There's gonna be Twitter drama over this shit.

4553
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:25,040
Yeah, there is.

4554
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:30,200
I wonder if people were randomly adding us earlier.

4555
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:32,560
They were all trying...

4556
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:35,040
People were randomly adding us when we were playing Quick Play.

4557
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:36,280
Really?

4558
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:36,820
Yeah.

4559
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:39,060
No, I think those were friend recommendations.

4560
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:41,340
Yeah, they're trying to get like...

4561
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:42,140
Uh...

4562
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:42,860
Trial points.

4563
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:45,760
No, I think it just recommends that every time.

4564
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:46,480
Really?

4565
02:14:46,900 --> 02:14:47,060
Oh.

4566
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:48,940
Alright, well...

4567
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:49,540
GG's guys.

4568
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:51,220
I had a great time with all of you.

4569
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:51,960
That was great, guys.

4570
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:52,800
That was great, guys.

4571
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:53,180
Yeah.

4572
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:54,680
I had fun being a double agent.

4573
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:55,300
Yeah.

4574
02:14:55,660 --> 02:14:56,440
Yeah, you did.

4575
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:57,460
I think I was a double agent.

4576
02:14:58,180 --> 02:14:59,360
I won't see you tomorrow.

4577
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:00,640
I was just eating dirt.

4578
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:03,760
I'd expect nothing less.

4579
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:04,720
Get it!

4580
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:05,440
Yay!

4581
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:07,600
You know, if we lived...

4582
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:07,880
Good-bye-ness.

4583
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:12,040
If we lived for like three more teams, we could have been top six.

4584
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:13,880
Type shit.

4585
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:14,460
Yeah.

4586
02:15:14,640 --> 02:15:15,460
Or if I didn't get knocked.

4587
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:16,760
Oh, that's true.

4588
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:17,140
Oh, yeah.

4589
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:17,780
That's true.

4590
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:18,700
We got knocks instead.

4591
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:20,580
I was last to get knocked the second round.

4592
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:21,080
That's what matters.

4593
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:22,960
If Sherfer wasn't throwing...

4594
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,060
I would be doing something wrong.

4595
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:25,720
Actually, I was last to get knocked.

4596
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:29,300
Nobody resed me when I got knocked.

4597
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:30,940
Nobody resed me.

4598
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:31,560
Nobody resed me.

4599
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:31,780
Everybody...

4600
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:32,660
First to curse us.

4601
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:36,520
Everybody just watched me crawl away, the support player.

4602
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,440
Instead of resing me.

4603
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:40,240
That's all I'm going to say.

4604
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:41,520
I tried.

4605
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:42,340
Then I got gunned.

4606
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:44,260
That's life's time.

4607
02:15:44,540 --> 02:15:46,820
I could have been resed two minutes ago.

4608
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:47,540
Goodbye.

4609
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:48,980
GG's.

4610
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:49,340
Leave.

4611
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:49,860
Goodbye.

4612
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:50,540
Bye-bye, guys.

4613
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:52,060
Bye.

4614
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:52,760
Bye.

4615
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:55,260
I'll stay in the server.

4616
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:55,980
Is this part of the experiment?

4617
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:56,660
I get...

4618
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:58,420
This is my VC chat now.

4619
02:15:58,880 --> 02:15:59,160
Yeah.

4620
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:00,380
Thank you, everybody, for watching.

4621
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:02,210
I had a great time with...

4622
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:06,280
Surefire, Mac, and RPR.

4623
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:06,800
It was...

4624
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:09,520
I hope you guys had a fun time watching as well.

4625
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,720
I'm free on Sunday.

4626
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:11,960
Yay.

4627
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:15,020
My vacation starts tomorrow.

4628
02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:16,060
Yay.

4629
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:17,640
Yay.

4630
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:19,240
Yippee.

4631
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,360
But that was really fun.

4632
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:25,480
I was mostly a heal bot, but...

4633
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:27,300
I felt like I had to.

4634
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:29,400
Like, I literally could not do anything but heal.

4635
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:32,320
Because every time they peaked, I had to, like, press Q.

4636
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:34,260
Yay.

4637
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:35,760
Vacation starts tomorrow.

4638
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:36,880
But I had a fun time.

4639
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:38,680
It was a fun time checking out this game.

4640
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:42,840
I hope you guys enjoyed watching with us.

4641
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:46,580
And enjoyed watching our adventure today with everyone.

4642
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:49,240
And...

4643
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:52,420
Please feel free to check out the game right now.

4644
02:16:52,420 --> 02:16:53,380
You can wishlist it.

4645
02:16:53,460 --> 02:16:56,460
I hope that some of you guys were able to get keys for the closed beta.

4646
02:16:56,780 --> 02:17:01,340
You can wishlist the game on Steam right now by clicking on the link pinned in my chat.

4647
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:05,160
A huge shout out to Faith Trigger for sponsoring all of us.

4648
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:09,100
Sponsoring me, Shur4, RPR, and MAC for the tournament.

4649
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:11,060
It was a great time checking the game out.

4650
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:11,960
And I hope you guys had a fun time.

4651
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:12,840
I know I said that a lot.

4652
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,560
But I really hope you guys had a fun time watching.

4653
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:16,600
Anyway, guys.

4654
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:18,820
For those who are new here.

4655
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:20,740
My name is DogiBird.

4656
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:22,600
I usually stream on YouTube.

4657
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:24,060
So, please check me out there.

4658
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:26,280
If you want to know whenever I stream on Twitch.

4659
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,140
Please follow me on Twitter.

4660
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:34,040
Because I usually tweet out whenever I'm online on Twitch.

4661
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:36,160
If you want to support me via other means.

4662
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:37,280
Check out my merch.

4663
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:40,820
I have my ramen collab out now for a Doki blade.

4664
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:42,740
A real ass cooking knife.

4665
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:48,680
And I have some stuff you can pre-order or buy right now on my personal store.

4666
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,560
The Doki merch store.

4667
02:17:49,820 --> 02:17:50,240
Hey guys!

4668
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:51,400
As always, everybody.

4669
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:52,340
Stay hydrated.

4670
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:54,380
Pause to check out when we're around to get that blood flow.

4671
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:55,240
And you sail for me.

4672
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:56,080
Head to bed.

4673
02:17:56,180 --> 02:17:57,440
Cause you deserve it.

4674
02:17:57,620 --> 02:17:58,960
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4675
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:00,220
Bye guys!

4676
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:01,340
Bye!

4677
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:01,700
Bye!

4678
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:01,960
Bye!

4679
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:03,180
Bye!
