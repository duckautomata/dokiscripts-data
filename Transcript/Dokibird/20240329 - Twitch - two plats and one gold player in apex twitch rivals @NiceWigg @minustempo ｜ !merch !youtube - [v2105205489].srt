1
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:20,900
I just realized I forgot to set up some stuff no for my end I'm at my no no no I mean like I need to have you guys on my screen I really forgot about that I was like, there is something I forgot about!

2
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
How do you do the Discord overlay?

3
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,540
It's like, I use Foogey.

4
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,360
Oh crap, I'm just too lazy now.

5
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,640
Yeah, no, if I wasn't a streamer, I'd be lazy too!

6
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,660
And I was like, wait a minute, I knew something was missing on my screen.

7
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,640
Something very important.

8
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,220
Hey, where the fuck is this guy?

9
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,740
Alright, here you go.

10
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,360
Hey, where are you?

11
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
You're not on my screen.

12
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,520
Where is this?

13
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,260
Sorry, very professional chat, I know.

14
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,560
This is...

15
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,240
We're starting off very strong here.

16
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,540
Alright, there's you.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,260
You're gonna be far away from me, Tempo.

18
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,280
So, hello everybody.

19
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,760
I hope Tempo is not too loud.

20
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,980
Hello.

21
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,700
I hope he is not too loud, guys.

22
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,820
Am I not too loud?

23
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I don't know, actually.

24
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,520
Your mic is like...

25
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,460
You're like, in a very empty...

26
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:18,740
In a very empty room.

27
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,500
That's what...

28
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,260
Your room has definitely had no soundproofing done.

29
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:24,720
Wait, wait, wait.

30
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,740
My mic has four things.

31
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,880
It has the Olympic circle thingy.

32
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,520
What the fuck does that mean?

33
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,160
It has just a circle.

34
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,160
It has something that looks like a fortune cookie.

35
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,480
Oh, wait, do you have a Blue Yeti?

36
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,800
Yeah.

37
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,340
Okay, yeah, I was gonna say, that sounds like a Blue Yeti shit right there.

38
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,080
So, what do I do?

39
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,800
Fortune cookie?

40
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,380
I don't know.

41
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,820
It could be a circle or the Olympic thing.

42
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,380
Sound people.

43
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,900
What does... What should he do?

44
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,300
I... Okay, you...

45
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,940
Yeah, sound people help me out here.

46
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,660
I'm not like a sound person.

47
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,920
What the fuck do you... Why would I know this?

48
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,480
It seems like...

49
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,600
You're a streamer.

50
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,300
I thought... I thought you would know.

51
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,080
Yeah, I'm a streamer that outsources to other people on things that I don't know.

52
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,920
Like, sound being one of them.

53
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,620
I'm just here to choose things that look pretty.

54
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,780
That's really all I do.

55
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,380
Like...

56
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,580
Do you think I know anything about sound?

57
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,780
Oh, you want fortune cookie.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,220
Everyone says fortune cookie.

59
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,360
I am on a fortune cookie.

60
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,720
Why the fuck do you sound like you're in an... Do you have any, like... Like...

61
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,040
I have stuff in my room.

62
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,380
Do you have, like, any... It just feels like your room is, like, super empty.

63
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,900
That's what it sounds like.

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,980
I think because my door is open.

65
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,700
Does that make a difference?

66
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,420
Bro, I don't know.

67
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,080
Does it actually?

68
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,620
Does it actually?

69
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,640
Yeah, he sounds like you're... It sounds like you're in the bathroom.

70
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,620
Someone's, like, pad your wall.

71
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,640
That's true.

72
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,760
I was gonna say that too.

73
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,700
I was gonna say, like, push shit around your room.

74
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,560
Door is closed.

75
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,280
Does that... Does that change anything?

76
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,840
I guess it, like, improved a little bit.

77
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,860
It's, like, a little bit better.

78
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,360
But it's still... It's so weird.

79
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,240
It sounds like... Yeah, it sounds like you're literally in a bathroom.

80
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,280
That's really it.

81
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,560
Like, my room has stuff in it.

82
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,840
Yeah, but you need stuff on your walls.

83
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,100
Oh, there's nothing on the walls.

84
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,820
Yeah, that's why.

85
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,320
You need stuff on your walls.

86
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:22,840
That's why.

87
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,020
Should I just fill it with all those posters that... Yeah!

88
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,760
Your fans sent?

89
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

90
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,400
Yeah, I'll send you a list.

91
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,020
Wait!

92
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,840
Wait, you should!

93
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,280
Just all the... Just all the acoustic Doki posters?

94
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:36,760
Yeah!

95
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,480
Yeah, yeah!

96
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,060
It'll give you better soundproofing.

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,660
You should!

98
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,180
I'll give you a list of artists to buy from.

99
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,960
And then...

100
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,180
Okay, Doki artists.

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:51,420
If you have any Doki prints sent up on Etsy or anything, let me know.

102
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,580
And I'll make Tempo buy them with his own money.

103
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,880
He has the TSM money.

104
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Which isn't a lot, but, like...

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,100
Sorry, I should say that.

106
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,480
But if you get paid very well, Tempo...

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,980
TSM money.

108
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,940
Which is it?

109
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,180
You get paid very well, Tempo, for what you do.

110
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,180
Oh, no.

111
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,960
Don't worry.

112
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,040
I was spreading misinformation earlier, guys.

113
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,900
Don't... Don't put this on any eSport reporting news that a VTuber just...

114
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,760
Exposed payroll.

115
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,240
Guys, it was just a joke.

116
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,860
I swear.

117
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,480
I... I am so warmed up.

118
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,860
Now, I can't wait to...

119
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,240
Not hit any of these shots in the actual game.

120
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,560
Is... Is, like... Is, like, Wig still in the interview?

121
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,100
That's such a long interview.

122
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:53,980
I think so.

123
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,980
Where... Where is Wig?

124
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,220
Oh, my God.

125
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,360
I like how, like...

126
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,800
Wig is, like, the name of the tournament.

127
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,740
But, uh...

128
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,440
Greek is Cassie.

129
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,520
Wait, Greek is Cassie?

130
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,240
Isn't he playing?

131
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,600
Yeah!

132
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,360
Yeah, isn't... Wait, isn't he... Is he playing?

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,800
Wait...

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:09,960
Yeah, he's playing.

135
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,660
He's playing.

136
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,760
He's on one of the teams.

137
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,100
Why the fuck did I say Greek?

138
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,460
Oh, it says, Geek Lounge!

139
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,720
Oh, I thought that said Greek!

140
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,060
That would be so funny, though.

141
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,120
Oh, oh, wait.

142
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,340
Okay, in interviews.

143
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,180
Okay, got it.

144
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,480
That would've been so funny, though, if, like, Greek was the one casting it.

145
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,700
Oh, he should have cast it.

146
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,740
He should have casted it.

147
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,700
He should have... It would've been so funny!

148
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,420
It would've been really funny.

149
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,260
Also, guys, how is, um...

150
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,560
How was tempo?

151
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,940
Should I raise him up, or should I keep him this volume?

152
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,380
I don't know if Sound Guy is awake right now.

153
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,300
I'm still in the bathroom, so it's okay.

154
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:46,860
Yeah.

155
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,400
Tempo sounds good.

156
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm playing from the toilet.

157
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,520
Yeah, he is.

158
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,720
So, we do pretty badly...

159
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
To be fair, there's a lot of things against us right now.

160
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,600
Wait, where are the... Where are the listed teams?

161
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,840
That's not it.

162
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:01,920
That's not it.

163
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,640
It's in announcements, I think.

164
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,720
Guys, I just want you guys to know...

165
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
I'm gonna talk about this again when Wick joins us.

166
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,920
But, like, our team technically consists of two Plat players.

167
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
And a Gold player.

168
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
Cuz, wait, Tempo, you're Gold, right?

169
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,740
Who's the Gold player?

170
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,460
I'm in Plat.

171
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,160
You're in Plat?

172
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,220
Oh, three Plat.

173
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,920
Wait, no, is Wick in Gold or Plat?

174
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,420
Wick said he was in Plat.

175
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,260
It's three Plat players.

176
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,380
Oh, it's three Plat players.

177
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,320
Okay, it's okay.

178
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,560
I put two Plats and a Gold to increase engagement.

179
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,000
Wick's the Gold, right?

180
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,100
It looks better when I have a Gold in my title.

181
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,540
Cuz people are like, whoa, and a Gold player?

182
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,100
Okay, let me go de-rank myself here.

183
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,620
Yeah, I mean, that would be easy.

184
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,600
Where am I?

185
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,860
Actually, I'm very close to de-ranking.

186
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,440
Okay, it's for the views.

187
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,580
Anyway, so our team technically consists of three Plat players.

188
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,660
And the thing is that...

189
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,860
If you guys watched the drafting stage on Wick's stream...

190
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,200
I was on the list and it listed me as Plat 4.

191
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,020
Because technically...

192
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,280
Technically...

193
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,580
I had Plat 4.

194
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,260
As Doki Bird.

195
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,560
So I was listed as Plat 4.

196
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,620
So no one...

197
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,000
So people were like, who the fuck is this Plat 4 shitter?

198
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,620
Yeah.

199
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,460
So...

200
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,660
I committed the greatest heist of all time.

201
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,700
Convincing staff I was Plat 4.

202
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,300
I did say...

203
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,000
No, I did it right.

204
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,500
I was like, ooh, Masters.

205
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,100
But I play like a Plat player.

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,560
So...

207
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,420
That's why...

208
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
I literally said...

209
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,780
Okay, the reason why I was in Plat 4...

210
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,760
Was cuz they were like, what's your rank?

211
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,200
And I was like...

212
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,120
Well...

213
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,220
I got Masters...

214
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,840
In the last...

215
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,140
What was it?

216
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Five seasons.

217
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:07,900
But...

218
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,580
I play like a Plat player.

219
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,000
And then they're like...

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,200
Okay.

221
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,940
Give us your like...

222
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,620
Tracker thing.

223
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,820
And apparently the tracker lists your average rank.

224
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,120
Overall.

225
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,620
And my average rank overall on...

226
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,920
As Doki...

227
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,620
Is Plat.

228
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,660
I

229
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,020
got away with it!

230
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,480
Yeah!

231
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,460
I can't believe it!

232
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,340
I can't...

233
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,360
How does she keep getting away with this?

234
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,660
How does she keep doing this?

235
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,060
Oh my God!

236
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,040
It's so fucking crazy!

237
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,840
Somebody stop her!

238
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,700
Change the bat!

239
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,620
Oh, don't worry.

240
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,280
Don't worry guys.

241
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,840
Don't worry.

242
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,060
I'm way ahead of you.

243
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,540
So I improved!

244
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,200
Don't worry guys!

245
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,140
I thought of this too!

246
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,240
I thought of it as well!

247
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,420
I do...

248
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,300
I have one singular Plat badge.

249
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,580
I just need you guys to know that.

250
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,520
All...

251
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,460
Out of all the badges, I actually have one singular PLAT badge.

252
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,140
Okay, here, let me show you guys.

253
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,560
Um...

254
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,700
Where's the badges?

255
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,060
Look...

256
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,120
We're gonna ignore that, but...

257
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,280
Look at that!

258
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,840
My... my one singular PLAT badge!

259
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,360
Right here.

260
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,520
We're gonna ignore the other badges, chat.

261
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,720
We're gonna ignore the other ones.

262
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,080
We're gonna look at the ones that matter right now.

263
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:53,980
Alright?

264
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,940
The ones that matter.

265
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,300
Welcome back.

266
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,660
Hey, welcome back!

267
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Thanks, dude.

268
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,460
So, how was the interview?

269
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,860
It was good.

270
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,080
They said, uh, hope you win.

271
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,160
I just started laughing.

272
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,540
Oh.

273
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,380
Cause we're totally gonna win, right?

274
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,300
No, for sure, for sure.

275
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,980
Wait, what about now?

276
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,460
What do you mean, what about now?

277
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,560
What do you mean?

278
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,640
Does it still sound like I'm in a bad mood?

279
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:16,780
Oh.

280
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,460
Yes.

281
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,040
Yeah, it definitely does.

282
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,500
A little bit.

283
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,580
Wait, I just realized.

284
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,060
Oh my god.

285
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,660
They, like, locked out some of the badges because they haven't fixed it yet.

286
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,540
Oh no, really?

287
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,340
I just realized that.

288
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,140
Cause I was like, wait, I am missing badges.

289
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,460
What the fuck?

290
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,860
My PLAT badges, of course.

291
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,600
That's what I'm saying.

292
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,100
Yeah, of course.

293
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,820
You don't have any other badges.

294
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,940
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,060
My PLAT badges.

296
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,700
Cause like, for some reason, on my count, I only have one PLAT badge.

297
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,520
But like, obviously, I'm a multiple PLAT player.

298
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,620
I have a lot of bronze badges cause I was really bad at one point.

299
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,740
And then I improved to PLAT.

300
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,880
At one point?

301
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,080
Yeah.

302
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,200
Specifically, there's one point where you were bad?

303
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,880
No, no.

304
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,920
I literally have like six plus bronze badges.

305
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,320
Do you actually?

306
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,400
I've heard you have flags though.

307
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,100
I kind of want them.

308
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,860
I do.

309
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,480
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

310
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,820
How do I go see my badges?

311
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,260
Check out my stream right now.

312
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,220
Check it out.

313
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,860
Check it out.

314
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,960
Don't worry.

315
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,660
I thought of this too.

316
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,140
People were like, wait, she's not PLAT.

317
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,720
Don't worry.

318
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
I am PLAT cause I put my badges on.

319
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
All that matters is you got the badge on accounts.

320
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,680
Yeah.

321
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,280
We'll be sharing the first usable legends here soon.

322
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:29,880
Okay, cool.

323
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,440
Alright, nice.

324
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,440
I didn't mean to cut you off.

325
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,660
You're streaming on Twitch.

326
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,540
I was like...

327
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,400
Yeah, of course.

328
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,320
It's Twitch Rivals.

329
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,040
Why would I be streaming on Twitch?

330
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,380
I don't know.

331
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,480
I don't know.

332
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,040
It's literally Twitch Rivals.

333
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,740
Alright, let me put you... whoa.

334
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,320
Let me add you on the screen here.

335
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,320
Damn.

336
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,340
You got some nice bronze badges.

337
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,160
Yeah.

338
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,900
You like it?

339
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,780
Yeah.

340
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,360
Yeah.

341
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,060
You know I improved as a gamer.

342
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,640
Cause like, I went from bronze to PLAT.

343
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,580
I'm at my peak!

344
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,880
I'm at my peak right now.

345
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,840
Yeah!

346
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,720
Codes out!

347
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,260
Codes out!

348
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,180
Alright, I need to apparently raise up...

349
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,520
It's alright.

350
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,860
I'm not going to be the last person joining in anyway.

351
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,260
It'll be fine.

352
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,780
I can like... Okay, wait.

353
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,620
Ready?

354
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,760
We have our...

355
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,560
We have our comp here.

356
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,500
List of legends from map one.

357
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,160
Okay?

358
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,420
Fuse, Mad Maggie, Horizon, Revenant, Bloodhound, Rampart, Watson, or Gibraltar.

359
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,840
Wait, can you repeat that?

360
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,020
That's a lot of people.

361
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,200
Assault.

362
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,160
Okay.

363
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,840
Assault is going to be Fuse, Mad Maggie.

364
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, I can read it.

365
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,180
Skirmisher is going to be Horizon, Revenant.

366
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,720
Recon is going to be Bloodhound.

367
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,000
Controller is going to be Rampart, Watson, and then the last one is Gibraltar.

368
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,240
Okay, we clearly need like a a ring reader, so...

369
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,200
We need somebody to read the ring and we're going to survive here.

370
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,100
That's what people are probably going to do.

371
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,220
They're probably going to go Horizon, Blood, Watson, maybe?

372
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,300
Yeah, you know all the pros are going to take blood.

373
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,600
Okay.

374
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:05,760
Okay.

375
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,840
You're going to run everything down.

376
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,580
Yeah, Wig.

377
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,780
Our captain.

378
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,440
Yeah, you're going to run everything down.

379
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:10,900
Yeah, right?

380
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,380
Right, Wig?

381
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,280
Oh, hell no.

382
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:13,760
I'm not playing.

383
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,280
What?

384
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,120
What?

385
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,740
What do you mean, Wig?

386
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,600
You're clearly our captain pro.

387
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,460
It says...

388
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,740
It says captain pred pro.

389
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,880
Are you trying to say you're not professional?

390
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,040
Did you lie on your resume?

391
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,860
You lied on your resume.

392
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,460
Yes, of course.

393
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,080
My LinkedIn was a complete fucking lie.

394
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,120
I shouldn't even be here in the first place.

395
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,780
Fake it till you make it, I guess.

396
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,120
So are you playing Fuse?

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,120
Tempo?

398
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,840
No, we need somebody for control.

399
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,300
If Tempo wants to play Fuse, I'll play Bloodhound.

400
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:46,920
I'll take the L.

401
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,320
Yeah, that's fine.

402
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,600
Okay.

403
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,260
That's great.

404
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,660
And then I guess I'll play Watson then.

405
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,280
So we're playing Watson, Bloodhound, Fuse?

406
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,640
Fuck it, dude.

407
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,140
Lock me in.

408
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,440
I'm shutting down.

409
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,500
We need somebody to read the ring.

410
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,500
I mean, no, I agree.

411
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,280
Yeah, you're right.

412
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,500
We're starting off on World's Edge, so I play Geyser.

413
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,400
So we're Geyser.

414
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,800
Sorry, that's not the best POI.

415
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,920
You gave us Geyser?

416
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,920
I know, I panicked.

417
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,320
You gave us Geyser?

418
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,500
You're literally the fucking headliner.

419
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,040
You can request for any fucking POI.

420
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,980
I know, I panicked so bad.

421
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,180
And then we have Tempo that can kick off any pro player off the scrims.

422
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,600
I know, I know.

423
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,000
If they try to contest us.

424
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,000
I know, I got scared.

425
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,140
I said abuse your power, not be a bitch.

426
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,820
Oh, but I'm always a bitch, man.

427
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,800
I'm always a bitch, bro.

428
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,400
Oh, I was always a bitch, man.

429
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,680
What happened to you, man?

430
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,740
What happened?

431
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,560
I've been this way.

432
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,340
What happened?

433
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
We had to go back to childhood.

434
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,100
I don't know.

435
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,460
That was some emotional trauma.

436
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,620
How long ago...

437
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,480
How long ago did I become a little bitch?

438
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah, become a little fucking bitch.

439
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,060
I mean, Geyser's...

440
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,860
Realistically, Geyser's not awful.

441
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,580
It isn't.

442
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,320
No, it's pretty awful.

443
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,400
No, you guys are just coping now.

444
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,900
Does the flying thingy still go through Geyser?

445
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,900
Does the flying thingy still go through Geyser?

446
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,220
What?

447
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,760
The what thing?

448
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,340
The ball thingy.

449
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,320
The evac?

450
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,180
What the fuck is the ball?

451
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,660
What is the ball?

452
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,240
The flying ball.

453
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,180
The drone that flies with the ball.

454
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,980
What?

455
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,600
Why am I forgetting what that is?

456
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,160
Is that the loot tick?

457
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,640
Are you talking the loot balls?

458
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,700
Is that it?

459
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,380
Guys, I'm just...

461
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,820
Not bottom five.

462
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,540
That's my goal.

463
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,960
What do you mean, not bottom five?

464
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,340
Oh my god.

465
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,460
He watches Apex every day and said the loot ball thingy, dude.

466
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,780
No, the loot tick is the...

467
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,140
The cargo bot.

468
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Yeah, the loot tick is the thing with the legs.

469
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,560
Yeah, cargo bot.

470
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

471
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,720
Yeah, but he said the ball thingies.

472
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,380
Yeah, it's a ball we're playing.

473
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,560
He said it as if it's like something we fucking take.

474
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,620
Like a fucking...

475
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,800
The towers.

476
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,960
Oh my god.

477
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,300
Okay, the lobby is open.

478
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,880
I'm heading in.

479
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,920
Guys, we're gonna...

480
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,560
Not bottom five.

481
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,120
I'm actually not gonna use charge rifle and no one will run at us.

482
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,380
Not bottom five.

483
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,420
Let's go.

484
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
Okay, how good are you with the sentinel?

485
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,060
Bro.

486
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,520
Can we just run three snipers and just go somewhere high and then just try and snipe people and get kills that way?

487
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,120
And just make everyone angry?

488
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,180
Okay, we just...

489
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:42,440
The way to get to that area is that we have to make sure we don't dive to travel there first.

490
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,260
We have to make sure...

491
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,480
Well, no Valk is gonna be our crutch here.

492
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:46,860
We're fucked.

493
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,740
We have no Valk.

494
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,640
Remember, we need three evac towers.

495
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,840
Well, last time we played...

496
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,560
Well, actually, no, we didn't play.

497
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,100
But last time, you know...

498
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,720
That's when you and Tempo played.

499
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,360
I would say that we had Valk because we literally needed it.

500
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,620
Now we don't have it.

501
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,020
But no one else has Valk, too.

502
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,860
We're playing without Valk or an evac tower.

503
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,220
Okay, so at this point, we just gotta hope RNG are... Wait, wait, wait.

504
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,920
You have connections to Saff, right?

505
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,160
Can they...

506
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,120
Just spawn some evac towers in front of us?

507
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,480
Grieg just came to my chat.

508
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,560
Grieg just came to my room and said, if Tempo kills me, I'm pulling the fucking Ethernet cable.

509
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,640
So, Tempo, if you kill him, bro, my Internet goes out.

510
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,700
Yeah, but his Internet goes out, too.

511
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,160
He fucks over his phone.

512
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,580
Wait, what?

513
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,880
But you can go over to his room and pull his as well.

514
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,360
I can't pull out...

515
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,800
I can't pull out Hal's Internet.

516
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,800
You can pull... Okay.

517
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Tell Hal...

518
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,680
I'm in the house alone.

519
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,920
I can't pull out anyone's Internet.

520
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,560
No, you...

521
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,080
Wait.

522
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,080
Oh, wait.

523
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,460
How...

524
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,760
Does any TSM member live with you?

525
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,220
They all do, but no one's here.

526
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,340
No, no, but...

527
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,020
You can be like...

528
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,460
Just log in on his computer and then it'll just disconnect him.

529
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,320
No, no, no.

530
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,700
Threaten their PCs.

531
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,340
I'm gonna install Destroyer 2009 on your PC if you kill me.

532
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:15,620
Okay.

533
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,340
To be fair, I was gonna say, like, throw their PCs out, but you can do that.

534
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,080
Oh.

535
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,140
That's true.

536
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,180
Keep this mad for their PCs.

537
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,720
Threaten their PCs.

538
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,680
You literally have their, like, babies right now.

539
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,740
That's, like, the way to go.

540
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,500
Hold their PCs hostage.

541
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,160
Exactly!

542
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,020
Someone in my chat said hold their PCs hostage.

543
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,980
For first place.

544
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,340
Oh my god, we're cooking.

545
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,460
Oh my god.

546
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,440
Someone... I'm so happy I didn't listen to any of that and just... I literally come back to, we're cooking.

547
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,480
So I just know that was an absolute shitshow of words that I shouldn't have heard.

548
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,180
No, we're discussing about how Tempo should hold TSM PCs for hostage.

549
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,560
So it'd be like, your PC's gonna get ransomware if you kill us.

550
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,980
Holy fuck.

551
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,460
Bro!

552
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,040
They're gonna be so scared!

553
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
They wouldn't wanna kill us after that!

554
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,830
We're gonna do so well, guys.

555
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,110
I... not bottom five.

556
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,990
That's all I ask for.

557
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,800
Bottom five?

558
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,160
No, no.

559
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,180
No way it's bottom five.

560
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,080
There's no way.

561
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:35,940
There's no way.

562
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,680
There's no way!

563
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:45,740
And if we do get bottom five, the system hated us for... we were too good to play their games.

564
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,740
No, listen.

565
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,680
I'm gonna tell you right now.

566
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,840
You guys, listen.

567
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,380
I have the right to... Are you sipping something or laughing?

568
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,280
No, I'm sipping.

569
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,100
She's just laughing at you.

570
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,940
I was like, this is gonna be a serious game.

571
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,460
Now, here, listen.

572
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,920
I can get us where we need to be.

573
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:04,880
Okay.

574
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,440
Okay, how?

575
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,260
That... I don't know yet.

576
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,900
We're gonna figure it out.

577
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,580
Okay, okay.

578
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,160
Okay, I thought you figured it out already.

579
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,960
We don't have a Valk.

580
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,800
A Valk was really easy for me to get us to where we need to be.

581
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,580
But, I'm telling you, if we get there, I think Tempo's gonna pop off.

582
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,380
I'm serious here, too.

583
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,840
I'm not lying.

584
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,020
Okay, how much you wanna bet?

585
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,000
We don't have to bet anymore.

586
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,780
No, no, no, no.

587
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,920
I wanna know where the money is.

588
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Like, how much you wanna bet?

589
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,680
I'll bet you a second blended Subway sandwich.

590
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,340
We didn't do the first one.

591
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
I can't trust you on that.

592
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,920
You didn't do it either.

593
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,240
I was waiting for you.

594
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,880
I was waiting for you.

595
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,280
Technically, I'm free from that already.

596
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,540
Technically, Donkey Bird didn't promise.

597
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,840
Donkey Bird didn't promise a blended Subway.

598
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,740
I'm just saying.

599
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,640
I'll gift you five subs that Tempo gets.

600
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,680
Well, actually, how many kills though?

601
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,760
That's how much you believe in him.

602
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,480
Five subs.

603
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,300
That's how much.

604
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,600
His life is worth five subs.

605
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,160
That's like how many dollars.

606
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
Don't gaslight me.

607
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,020
You're playing on his downfall.

608
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,300
You're saying he's so bad.

609
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,720
No, I wanna know how much you believe in him.

610
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,100
But, clearly, you don't believe in him enough if it's worth five subs.

611
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,100
Alright.

612
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,360
Yeah, you couldn't be more right.

613
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,120
100%.

614
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,520
Yeah.

615
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,200
No offense, Tempo.

616
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,680
I love you to death.

617
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm not gonna sit here and say he's gonna get like ten kills.

618
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,300
I think Tempo gets like five in six games.

619
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,740
I can't believe... I can't believe he's... Like, if he gets a kill, it's gonna be on a pro player.

620
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,500
So you're trying to say that his pro player kills aren't even worth more than one sub per kill.

621
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,780
There we go.

622
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,360
It's not even worth one.

623
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,400
Wait, we're playing...

624
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,580
Only allowed legends is Fuzi, Mad Nagi, Horizon?

625
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,240
Wait, what?

626
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,180
Revenant Bloodhound.

627
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,680
Oh, there they're going.

628
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,500
Revenant Bloodhound.

629
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:51,860
Okay.

630
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,120
Yeah.

631
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:52,920
Yeah.

632
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Okay.

633
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,920
Bro, you mean...

634
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,780
You're trying to say Tempo is worth like $25 in kills?

635
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,940
Correct.

636
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,500
Bro!

637
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,320
Watch this.

638
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,720
If I had to pay Tempo to be on my team for $25, I'd pay him $25.

639
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,640
What are the odds someone ends up with negative points today?

640
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,420
Who's to learn?

641
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,800
Wait, say it again?

642
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,780
Say that again.

643
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,860
Who the fuck is that guy?

644
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,600
Who the fuck?

645
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,720
I don't know who the fuck Shalen is.

646
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,860
Yeah, I'm Doki.

647
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,980
Yeah, what are you talking about?

648
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,680
It's my first time being Doki.

649
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,220
Yeah.

650
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,320
Yeah.

651
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:32,840
Okay.

652
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,420
Five subs.

653
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:33,900
Okay.

654
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,500
If Tempo does... Wait, wait.

655
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,200
What was the deal?

656
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,780
If Tempo gets like one kill, it's five subs.

657
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,320
Holy shit.

658
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,780
One kill, five subs?

659
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,240
No, no.

660
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,160
Doki's making...

661
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,800
I didn't say that.

662
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,340
I can get a hundred subs here.

663
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,400
Yeah, okay, okay.

664
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,860
If Tempo gets one kill, you have to gift me and Tempo five subs each.

665
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,580
Oh my god.

666
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,020
Imagine Destroyer actually gets in his lobby.

667
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,980
Also, if he doesn't, you have to gift me five subs.

668
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,780
Alright, down.

669
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,520
That's fine.

670
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:08,780
I'll deal.

671
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,240
Okay.

672
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:09,940
Deal.

673
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,160
Alright.

674
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,060
Deal.

675
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,680
I don't know how I always get wrapped in these things with you, but it just matters.

676
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,120
It's fine.

677
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:14,960
Yeah!

678
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,940
We did it!

679
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,840
Of course you did it.

680
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,700
You do it every time.

681
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,580
You're so good at it.

682
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,660
You're so convincing.

683
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,400
That's insane to say!

684
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,080
How am I a little bitch, bro?

685
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,540
I'm a bitch for believing in my friends?

686
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,040
Now you don't agree that you're a little bitch?

687
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,940
You literally told me you've been a little bitch since you were young.

688
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,060
I'm believing in my friends.

689
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,480
See?

690
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,160
You literally told me.

691
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,060
You literally told me you've been a little bitch since you were in sixth grade.

692
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,340
Or since you were six.

693
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,760
And now you're not?

694
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,700
No.

695
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,120
No.

696
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,700
Actually, today's the day I change.

697
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm not a little bitch anymore.

698
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,980
Today's the day you change.

699
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,680
After giving us Geyser as a drop spot, today's the day you change.

700
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:58,860
Hey!

701
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,260
Hey!

702
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,760
Listen!

703
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,340
I got Command Center.

704
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,420
That's pretty fucking good.

705
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:02,880
Alright?

706
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,100
For the next map.

707
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:04,560
Alright?

708
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,580
I got that.

709
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,940
Maybe I am still a little bitch.

710
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,680
Holy shit.

711
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:11,820
Hey!

712
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,220
Listen.

713
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,320
All I'm saying is I'm gonna do this.

714
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,840
Drop Geyser.

715
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,560
Ready?

716
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,900
Look at me.

717
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,200
Look at me.

718
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,460
Yeah.

719
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,080
Banned from tourney.

720
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,860
Oh, fuck.

721
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,680
I spelled tourney wrong.

722
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,080
Oh, fuck.

723
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:23,980
FYI.

724
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,060
At knock.

725
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,220
Yeah, let him know.

726
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,620
At knock.

727
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,160
Cause knock's thinking about where free kills are now.

728
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,740
I guarantee it.

729
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,700
Okay, just be like...

730
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,460
And then he's licking his lips.

731
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,940
Just be like, if you kill us, Wig isn't gonna watch part of your team.

732
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,800
They might be thankful for that.

733
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,500
Oh, shit.

734
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:40,840
No.

735
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,500
You will watch their team if you kill us.

736
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,820
Wig's gonna watch your team.

737
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,980
No one should drop on us.

738
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,000
I told them they don't get any DC restarts that they do.

739
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,940
Oh my god.

740
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,740
You're a genius, bro.

741
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,540
Nice.

742
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,980
You're a genius.

743
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Hold them hostage.

744
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,000
Fuse.

745
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,440
Nice.

746
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,680
Oh, yeah.

747
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,200
Hold them hostage.

748
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,560
The only free skin I got.

749
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,220
Who am I going again?

750
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,880
Um.

751
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,280
Bloodhound.

752
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:05,940
Bloodhound.

753
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,660
Yeah, you're a role player.

754
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,920
And you're going Watson.

755
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,400
Yeah, yeah.

756
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm going Watson.

757
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,120
We're already.

758
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,820
We didn't get negative five.

759
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,660
So, that's good.

760
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,060
Yeah, we're doing it.

761
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,740
If someone goes negative, we have to be mean to them.

762
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,580
Yeah, we have to be mean to them.

763
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,360
We have to be mean.

764
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:22,900
Yeah, yeah.

765
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,900
Just spam who's negative five right now.

766
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,720
Who are we restarting for?

767
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,120
You gotta be mean to them.

768
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,660
Here we go.

769
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,140
We got this.

770
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,440
I can't beat Jump Master.

771
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,220
Okay.

772
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,580
Wow.

773
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,100
Alright.

774
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,660
Where am I landing?

775
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,280
Pass it to the little bitch, I guess, dude.

776
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,940
Yeah, the little bitch who's captain.

777
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,260
Yeah, yeah.

778
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,380
Little baby.

779
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,300
We're trying to build up your confidence.

780
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,560
That's why I'm giving you Jump Master.

781
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,400
You just called me a bitch like forty times, though.

782
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,200
Yes, but if you cry about it, then you are... Now you can build it back up.

783
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,500
Yeah.

784
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,340
After she brought it down.

785
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:52,860
Yeah.

786
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,740
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

787
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,060
You're so right.

788
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,440
Yeah.

789
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Words will never hurt me.

790
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,600
Exactly.

791
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,660
Only in high school.

792
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,640
Exactly.

793
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,300
It really hurt in high school.

794
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,720
We're not gonna get contested, right?

795
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,020
There's no way to contest this.

796
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,760
It's fucking dicey.

797
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,280
I'm not gonna leave in the game.

798
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,880
It's like, what the fuck do you want Geyser for?

799
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,180
It's literally the shittiest drop ever.

800
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:17,960
Oh, I should have went No Name.

801
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,760
I'm just gonna go through the tunnel.

802
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,040
So they don't take my loot.

803
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,120
I'll go through the tunnel.

804
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:21,880
Okay.

805
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,260
We have no beacon.

806
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,160
Yeah.

807
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,400
We're off to a good start.

808
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,640
We could go to Overlook and get it.

809
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,900
Wait, there's Gents killing more.

810
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,740
Oh, it's not fucking anonymous mode.

811
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,660
Yeah.

812
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,120
It's okay.

813
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,300
It's okay.

814
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,480
Don't restart it.

815
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:36,940
We're fine.

816
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,540
We're fine.

817
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,920
That's one less team to worry about.

818
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,600
True, actually.

819
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,180
I'll tell them to put it on for the next game, to be honest.

820
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,720
Alright.

821
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,040
They didn't have it on during what's it called either?

822
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,860
The Asia Festival, right?

823
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,960
I don't remember.

824
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,680
I don't think it's common to have it on for Asia, isn't it?

825
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,800
I think you're right.

826
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,480
It's been a while since I played Asia tournaments.

827
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,420
We can grab two charge rifles, Wig.

828
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,800
You already have one?

829
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Do not listen.

830
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,100
To the dark comments in your mind.

831
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,340
Let's be the most annoying team in the game.

832
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,620
Do not listen.

833
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,820
I don't have a backpack, bro.

834
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,260
Okay, we're off to a really, really good start.

835
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,800
No, no, no.

836
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,180
It means you're gonna grab a...

837
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,540
You'll get purple backpack later on in life.

838
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,580
Yeah.

839
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,340
Yeah, yeah.

840
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,060
Next game.

841
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,300
Next game you'll get a...

842
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:29,800
Okay.

843
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,860
Here's this.

844
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,420
Okay, guys.

845
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,140
Thank God we don't have the...

846
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,340
the armors left on the floor because I don't think we were ever gonna find armors in Geysi.

847
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,860
No, we were probably gonna get just triple white anyway.

848
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,420
Yeah.

849
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,260
There's no difference now.

850
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,660
Geysi was like... Yeah, Geysi was pretty bad.

851
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,760
It's not like awful.

852
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,220
No, it's fucking awful.

853
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,780
What do you mean?

854
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,780
Yeah, it's pretty awful.

855
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,840
Well, if the little drone is flying by, it's okay.

856
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,680
Yeah, you can shoot the drone.

857
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,200
Do we have a Valkyrie?

858
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:02,900
No.

859
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,140
No?

860
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:03,820
No.

861
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,800
Why would you think we have...

862
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,940
The little drone did not come this way.

863
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,400
Who didn't ping it three times?

864
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:10,840
Tempo.

865
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,180
It's really... It's really cute that you think we'll have anything.

866
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:14,920
It's...

867
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:16,940
Okay, wait.

868
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,560
Where do we go?

869
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,460
I'm trying to think.

870
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,400
We gotta craft up.

871
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,300
Craft a bat real quick.

872
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,680
I have nothing.

873
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,480
You guys have stuff?

874
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,060
I'm gonna craft... I didn't.

875
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,780
I'm gonna craft a bat right now.

876
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,740
We have four bats.

877
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,200
I can craft an extra bat for you.

878
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,100
Let me... Okay.

879
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,420
I'm gonna hit this raven and just see where people are going.

880
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,280
So we're not getting routed.

881
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,260
Wait, they might be routing that tunnel.

882
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,980
I think I might have saw someone.

883
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,240
One sec.

884
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,100
Okay, cause I'm crafting this.

885
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,980
If I get shot, I will craft it.

886
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,640
Nah, we're good.

887
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:37,840
We're good.

888
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,040
We're good.

889
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:38,860
Chillin'.

890
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,820
I still don't have a backpack.

891
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,480
It's crazy.

892
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,180
Here.

893
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,640
Here's a bat.

894
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:43,740
Nice.

895
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,040
I'm pretty sure I saw a white backpack.

896
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,220
Maybe.

897
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,120
Maybe.

898
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,260
Alright, we should try to rotate to where a beacon is.

899
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,160
Where is beacon?

900
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,480
Well, big mod's probably still over there.

901
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,460
So I don't know if I want to go that way.

902
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,280
Oh, thank you.

903
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,240
See, look at that.

904
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,280
Siphon's pretty shit.

905
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,180
I mean, we could just rotate it with a siphon, but there might be multiple squads rotating in that way.

906
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,720
There's no siphon side.

907
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,680
Let's just start walking up.

908
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,200
Alright, I believe in you.

909
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,980
I don't have a new guy's tower.

910
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,440
Is anyone in?

911
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,260
Nope.

912
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,780
Nope.

913
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,600
We are in an awful spot for our rotation.

914
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,340
There's a pack right there.

915
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
I don't know if...

916
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,120
Alright, who's gonna get it?

917
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,320
Look at all of us.

918
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,560
Let's start moving up.

919
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,500
Wait, there's like two.

920
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,180
Yeah, let's do that.

921
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,580
Alright.

922
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,980
How are we still on?

923
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,440
We're very...

924
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,400
We're very not so good.

925
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,180
Right now.

926
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,800
Alright, I'm gonna go get it cause... Alright, I'm gonna cover you.

927
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,000
Alright, I'm watching with the charge rifle.

928
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,660
I am putting fences behind us.

929
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,820
Okay, I'm dead guys.

930
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,580
This is a really good try.

931
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:39,900
Okay, that's fine.

932
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,080
I'm so fucked.

933
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,580
The one is blue armored.

934
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,300
That's okay.

935
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,000
We're so fine.

936
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,700
They're dropping down, guys.

937
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,520
They're dropping down.

938
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,360
They're heading to that area.

939
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,840
I forgot what that area is called.

940
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,340
Okay, I got an R301.

941
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,600
Suck it, bitch!

942
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,380
Yeah, fuck him up!

943
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:56,840
Tempo!

944
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,900
Tempo, go Tempo, go!

945
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,660
I'm dead.

946
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,280
We're gonna reload.

947
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,480
I'm reloading, I'm reloading.

948
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,600
Are they moving through?

949
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,540
They already crossed over that, yeah.

950
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,080
Are they in the building?

951
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,080
I don't know.

952
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,840
They ran back into Syphon.

953
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,180
Okay, I'm gonna just come up and scan cause we should try to get one of these buildings and move in from there.

954
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,800
I'm gonna scan one sec.

955
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,640
We're right behind you.

956
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,240
Yeah, come up, come up.

957
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,340
Nice job, Tempo.

958
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,500
Oh my god, Tempo's doing it!

959
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,980
I have 12 nades.

960
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,600
If we can just trap someone somewhere...

961
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,140
If we can just trap someone...

962
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,320
Let's shit loose.

963
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,840
I mean, I have a gold R301, realistically.

964
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,780
No matter how bad I am.

965
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,640
13 nade.

966
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,820
We wanna keep moving in a little bit though cause I don't see anyone posted up here at all.

967
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,120
We wanna keep moving.

968
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,840
We're gonna keep moving.

969
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm just gonna keep scanning so we don't get routed on.

970
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,120
We're gonna keep moving.

971
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,120
I'm just gonna keep scanning so we don't get routed on.

972
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,900
Alright, I'm right behind you.

973
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,120
Guys!

974
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,080
We're not 20th!

975
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,680
No, that's huge for us.

976
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,540
We're not 20th!

977
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,620
We're making waves!

978
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,460
It was Keon.

979
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,620
It was fucking Keon.

980
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,080
Ah, what?

981
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,900
No, no, no.

982
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,520
There was, there was, there was.

983
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,240
I think Halcon.

984
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,060
Oh my god.

985
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,420
I don't think this whole side's looted though.

986
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,140
That makes me definitely think it's towards...

987
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,320
Definitely, this is not...

988
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,540
I have 12... I have 20 shield cells.

989
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,140
Alright, we need to go middle.

990
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,000
We need to take this gondola across.

991
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:12,500
Alright.

992
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,480
I mean, we have... Oh, there's a ring council!

993
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,080
Yeah, that's where we're gonna go hit.

994
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,500
There was a team here 30 seconds ago.

995
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,280
Get in the house!

996
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,060
I mean, car.

997
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,580
What the house?

998
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,480
We're gonna get in the house over here.

999
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,880
If there's a team here, just stay on the gondola.

1000
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1001
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,640
I can stick them with my arc.

1002
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,340
Okay, someone protect me while I do the ring council.

1003
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,060
Yeah, this is extremely sketched, but I think we should...

1004
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,820
Yeah, I mean, if I die, you can craft me.

1005
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,120
Wait, we don't have anybody to craft.

1006
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,700
Okay, never mind.

1007
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
I'm just dead.

1008
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,380
Okay.

1009
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,960
I'm pretty sure we're like the only team that has white armor right now.

1010
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,180
There's no fucking way.

1011
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,740
No, no, no, we're good.

1012
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,720
Wait, what if we grab the fucking...

1013
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,520
There's a team over here.

1014
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,340
We can right now.

1015
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,060
We're gonna go do it right now.

1016
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,940
Why didn't we grab the cash right behind us?

1017
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,700
I don't need any evil cash.

1018
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,960
I'm blue, bitches.

1019
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,680
That's all you, buddy.

1020
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,980
I'm getting this cash for sure.

1021
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,940
I'm going with Tim.

1022
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm going with Wig just in case we get...

1023
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,360
I charge rifled him from 450 meters.

1024
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:10,780
I charge rifled him from 450 meters.

1025
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,560
We love that for you.

1026
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,220
Nice shot, buddy.

1027
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,920
I'm so proud of you.

1028
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,500
Don't worry, guys.

1029
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,260
I am still gonna fence this up.

1030
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,360
I'm on our roof.

1031
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,540
Dude, another team flew in there.

1032
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,720
I'm gonna fence this up, guys.

1033
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,100
I'm doing it.

1034
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,860
You're playing in this building?

1035
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,060
We gotta move up now.

1036
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,980
We're gonna move up a little bit more.

1037
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,980
We can't really move right now anyway because there's...

1038
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,640
We're stuck.

1039
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,780
We're stuck, Stepbro.

1040
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,220
I wanna go through, like, launch.

1041
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,140
But, again, we don't have no evac towers.

1042
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,360
I don't think we're ever gonna find evac towers.

1043
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,380
No, I know.

1044
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,140
This is so fucked.

1045
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,140
I don't think so, guys.

1046
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:45,800
I got one!

1047
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,340
Oh!

1048
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,420
Go, Tempo!

1049
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,800
I've always believed in you.

1050
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,400
That's five stops.

1051
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Tempo, Tempo, where is it?

1052
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,380
Tempo!

1053
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,000
What the fuck are you doing?

1054
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,060
What the fuck?

1055
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,020
Oh my god, Tempo!

1056
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,100
I just got fucking rocked.

1057
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:02,820
Dive!

1058
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,060
Dodge!

1059
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,160
I'm safe.

1060
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,160
Bro, I'm covering.

1061
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,120
I got a kill.

1062
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,080
That's five subs!

1063
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,980
It was on the bridge.

1064
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,220
Five subs already?

1065
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,840
That's five subs to Tempo, five subs to me.

1066
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,720
That's ten subs.

1067
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:16,920
That's insane.

1068
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,260
Alright, we need to go command center.

1069
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,120
We need to get the fuck out of this position.

1070
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,540
Alright, I can charge.

1071
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,900
I can scan again.

1072
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,660
Okay, let's believe it.

1073
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,220
There's no way someone's gonna shoot me, right?

1074
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,320
There's no way.

1075
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,100
I'm watching, I'm watching.

1076
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,580
There's a team on south.

1077
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,540
A team just fenced up south.

1078
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,380
A team just fenced up south.

1079
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,520
That's fine, that's fine.

1080
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,620
We can just play in here for right now.

1081
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,040
I'm trying to find an evac.

1082
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,000
Can I play in the middle, up here?

1083
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,180
Realistically, us getting out of this situation with that one is like...

1084
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,080
Zero brewing.

1085
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,240
Yeah, we need... unless like everybody suddenly collides with each other.

1086
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,700
Let me get the south team.

1087
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,920
With my charge rifle.

1088
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,380
Alright.

1089
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,320
Just in case.

1090
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,000
We're good, yeah, just fence up.

1091
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,080
Nice job, Toki!

1092
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,920
Look at me go!

1093
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm fencing!

1094
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,400
Look at you go!

1095
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,820
I'm contributing to the team.

1096
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,560
Hell yeah, we're alive.

1097
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,640
That's also a W.

1098
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,700
I'll take not 20th all day, every day.

1099
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,560
I'm being so serious.

1100
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,800
Shit on, kid.

1101
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,140
Shit on, kid.

1102
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,110
We're okay.

1103
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,950
Everything will be fine.

1104
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,170
No, we're fine.

1105
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,510
No one's north, no one's middle.

1106
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,170
I just realized, bro, my fucking...

1107
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,850
We all have...

1108
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,410
Wait, you guys got purple and blue backpacks?

1109
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,290
How did I end up with a white backpack?

1110
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:39,890
Oh wait, I have a blue backpack.

1111
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,270
I have a fucking wig.

1112
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,810
Realistically, like, RV down here wouldn't be bad.

1113
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,050
I just don't know how the fuck we get there.

1114
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,570
How was I the one to end up with the shittiest backpack out of all of you?

1115
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,450
There's a team on bridge, isn't there?

1116
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:52,950
Fuck me.

1117
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,950
I'm gonna go away.

1118
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:54,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1119
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,950
The team on bridge is the one I gotta knock on.

1120
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,350
Can we get underneath this platform if we run?

1121
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,250
Right now?

1122
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,970
I mean, I don't know when else we're gonna do it.

1123
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,710
I feel like... I mean, it's very risky.

1124
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,670
That's for sure.

1125
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,570
Yeah, it definitely is risky.

1126
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,910
I don't think there's anyone on our right, though.

1127
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,550
At least we have a rotational spot later.

1128
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,170
We can't... I don't want to play blue bins because we're gonna go against the Gibraltar team who's gonna ult us.

1129
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,030
I have all...

1130
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,250
Do we have full kill?

1131
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:23,810
They're not rez'd?

1132
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,530
Did you knock the team on the left?

1133
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,030
Well, we don't know who exactly...

1134
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,330
I killed a team on the bridge.

1135
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,270
Yeah, but they might have rez'd because they have a rez beacon.

1136
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,310
Is the rez beacon activated?

1137
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,710
Yeah, they definitely rez'd.

1138
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,230
It's activated.

1139
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,750
I was gonna say, if we kill the team on the left, then we can go there.

1140
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,250
Okay, but guys, we can scan again.

1141
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:44,910
Loki could.

1142
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,430
Well, actually, let's go back and do it.

1143
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1144
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,010
There's really no negative.

1145
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:50,810
Exactly.

1146
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,410
Exactly.

1147
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,070
We can do one last...

1148
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,890
Gibraltar, random Gibraltar on you.

1149
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,250
Wait, wait, wait.

1150
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,330
Oh, he's downstairs.

1151
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:02,810
He's running away.

1152
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,310
Hit the beacon.

1153
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,450
Okay, okay, okay.

1154
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,850
I got really scared.

1155
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,410
Hit the beacon and run back to me immediately because they're above you.

1156
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,410
Okay, that is not very...

1157
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,790
I don't have a lot of confidence, but here we go.

1158
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,170
One dropped down.

1159
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,910
They went low ground, I think.

1160
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,250
Yeah, they're low ground over here.

1161
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:19,830
You're good.

1162
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,590
We're still healthy.

1163
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,590
I still don't know...

1164
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,270
I did not see the Gibraltar at all.

1165
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,630
We need to get underneath, brothers.

1166
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,250
Wait, wait, wait.

1167
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,990
We have no evac.

1168
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,830
You got a full kill.

1169
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,130
Tempo is the GOAT.

1170
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,550
Oh, he's got 10 subs each!

1171
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,330
We need to move, we need to move, we need to move.

1172
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,690
Okay, that's 10 subs each person.

1173
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,790
Come over here, we're gonna come over here and play this.

1174
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,010
Oh my god.

1175
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,250
I have 12 nades.

1176
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,730
Okay, you're gonna set up your gen right here, Ducky.

1177
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,450
Right here?

1178
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,250
Okay, right now?

1179
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,410
Actually, wait, don't do that yet.

1180
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,390
I want to see if we can get an RV.

1181
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,850
If there's no one in an RV, we should get there underneath.

1182
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:58,170
Tempo, you think you could, like, fuse ulti these guys up here on the bridge that we run for RV?

1183
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,930
Yeah, let me find their wads and gen.

1184
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,550
Okay, I'm gonna keep fencing.

1185
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:03,930
I destroyed it.

1186
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,990
Wait, there's a fuse queue somewhere.

1187
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,010
Oh, Jesus.

1188
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,090
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

1189
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,970
We're still fucking fine.

1190
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,630
Yeah, we're good, we're good, we're good.

1191
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,150
We just need to get in zone more, which sucks.

1192
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,410
Yeah, we're just at the...

1193
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,450
I don't even think we're in zone.

1194
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,670
Wait, what the fuck?

1195
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,670
Bro, I'm fucking setting this up.

1196
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,510
Yeah, shut up, shut up, they're pushing, they're pushing.

1197
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,110
They are?

1198
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,170
Okay, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1199
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,510
I'm a shot from the team in front of us.

1200
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:35,630
Yeah.

1201
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,950
Okay, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good here.

1202
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:39,870
I'm good now, I'm good now.

1203
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:40,550
Alright.

1204
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,110
I don't see him.

1205
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,410
Wait, I think they want to push us in the back.

1206
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,130
I'm checking.

1207
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,970
Okay, they're not, they're not, they're not, they're not.

1208
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,650
They're shooting like this.

1209
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:53,930
Jen, go down, it's okay.

1210
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,730
It's pretty annoying, actually.

1211
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,710
They're leaving, they're leaving, they're gone.

1212
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,730
Alright, we need to go to RV now, we need to jump down, this is really bad for us actually.

1213
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,430
Yeah, we don't have...

1214
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,810
No, he doesn't have it anymore.

1215
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,470
Can you cue them?

1216
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,150
We're gonna move left, we're gonna move left, come up.

1217
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,070
I only have that one cue.

1218
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,470
We're good, we're good, come down.

1219
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,890
We're so healthy, we're so good, we're so good.

1220
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,510
Oh, we are not...

1221
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,410
No, no, no, no, protect that, protect that.

1222
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,230
Oh, keep blocking that, keep blocking that.

1223
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:21,990
We're so healthy.

1224
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,690
Yeah, you're good, you're good.

1225
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,710
We're not in zone, but we're so healthy.

1226
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,370
I'm not in zone, but you're good, you're good, you're gonna play without me.

1227
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:26,490
You're not in zone?

1228
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,630
Okay, that is all I needed to know.

1229
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,150
That's fine, that's fine, we're okay, no kill kill me, what a piece of shit.

1230
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,090
You guys are good, man.

1231
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,110
I had a Moby on my death box, by the way.

1232
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,070
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, I can get it and raise him here.

1233
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:38,170
Okay.

1234
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,450
You probably could actually, you got this.

1235
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, get it, get it, get it.

1236
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,030
Temple, I believe in you.

1237
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,930
The zone doesn't hurt as much.

1238
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:45,830
Did you get the...

1239
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,150
He did not get the Moby.

1240
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:47,870
Okay, okay.

1241
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:53,210
We're good, we're good.

1242
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,730
We're fine, we're fine.

1243
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,350
Let me shoot these guys up here.

1244
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,810
I'll rez, I'll rez, I'll rez.

1245
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,290
I'm looking up on the bridge, I don't see them.

1246
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,130
I think we're okay, bro.

1247
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,890
How are we not getting looked at right now?

1248
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,890
Don't take this wig!

1249
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,070
Free KP over here!

1250
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,050
We're good, we're good.

1251
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:12,970
I'm just kidding.

1252
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,710
Don't worry, my fences will protect us.

1253
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,410
Alright, we need to get in that corner.

1254
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,070
They're fighting on bridge.

1255
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,890
You guys should go to RV right now.

1256
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,930
RV, RV, RV, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1257
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,130
Go, go, go, without me.

1258
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,650
They can't, they're not watching.

1259
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,170
They're watching now, they're watching now.

1260
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,310
They're watching now, they're watching now.

1261
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,930
Someone's inside, someone's inside RV.

1262
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,250
What do you mean he's in the RV?

1263
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,590
He's flashed, RV is flashed.

1264
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,450
He's dead, dead, dead.

1265
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,230
No, we lost him, but that's okay.

1266
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,550
Okay, we have a strat here though.

1267
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,250
We have a strat, one sec.

1268
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,730
We're gonna get in this corner over here.

1269
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,910
You still have your mobi if you looted your body.

1270
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,770
I didn't loot it, I didn't loot it.

1271
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,490
He didn't loot his body.

1272
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,790
I couldn't loot anything.

1273
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:57,030
Wait, does that guy have a body?

1274
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,210
No, no.

1275
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,290
Okay, we have a plan, I'm not even kidding.

1276
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:02,710
We have a plan.

1277
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,990
We're gonna get into this corner, come here.

1278
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,890
Come, come, come, come, come.

1279
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:08,570
Come to me.

1280
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,530
We're so good, we're healthy.

1281
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,170
That's a good placement.

1282
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,450
I might die now because I hesitated.

1283
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,470
Oh my god, don't be a little bitch.

1284
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,730
I hesitated, I hesitated.

1285
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,670
There's no way.

1286
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,630
There's no way there was a full team.

1287
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,970
There's no way.

1288
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,530
It didn't matter.

1289
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,310
It didn't matter.

1290
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,770
There was a full team.

1291
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,530
We're on the other side of the rock.

1292
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,090
If we get there, we're vibing.

1293
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,830
Oh my god.

1294
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,110
Not a single evac.

1295
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,410
What are we supposed to do?

1296
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,110
It's okay, we got three kills.

1297
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,590
We got three kills.

1298
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,050
Four points.

1299
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,990
Four points is actually not bad.

1300
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,230
Four points is like the 10th place area.

1301
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:53,690
We're good.

1302
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,090
And also, no stand.

1303
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,190
No evac.

1304
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,790
That's pretty good.

1305
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,070
Of course I got a fucking pyro howl.

1306
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:10,270
Tempo, go over there and hold his PC hostage right now.

1307
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,950
Tempo, run in there bro and summon his monitor immediately.

1308
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:20,230
Run over there, take his monitor, show it on stream, and give Hal a message.

1309
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,490
Snipe down, killed you, and Hal.

1310
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,270
I got a tag team, bro.

1311
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:28,250
I got Eiffel Tower'd by the fucking XTSM.

1312
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,890
Guys, we got four kills and we didn't die 20th.

1313
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:32,810
That's all that matters.

1314
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,670
I'm not gonna lie, that was pretty good.

1315
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,710
Yeah, that was pretty good with the situation we were in.

1316
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,650
Yeah, that situation was pretty terrible.

1317
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:40,570
Yeah, that was pretty terrible.

1318
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,690
Pretty fucking terrible.

1319
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,270
I feel like that's what we say every time.

1320
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:46,170
I feel like that's what we say every time.

1321
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,750
That was like really bad for us, but we did kinda good.

1322
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,110
That's what we say.

1323
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,590
That's like our motto.

1324
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,670
Okay, Tempo, how many kills you got?

1325
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,070
We got a lot.

1326
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,570
He got two kills, so that's ten subs each.

1327
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:58,850
Fuck me.

1328
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,530
Yeah, pay up.

1329
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,890
Oh shit, I'm torched.

1330
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,170
Oh my god, my moderator's still alive.

1331
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:06,490
W.

1332
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:08,110
Your moderator?

1333
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,210
Yeah, he is.

1334
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,090
Alucard, he's the coach.

1335
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:15,230
Okay, if he has a higher placement than us, he should give us some of his prize winnings.

1336
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:17,470
Okay, if he has a higher placement than us, he should give us some of his prize winnings.

1337
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:18,030
Alright, I'm back.

1338
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,730
That's how it works if I don't pay him to be my mod.

1339
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,590
That's how it works if I don't pay him to be my mod.

1340
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,890
But I still take a percentage of his winnings.

1341
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,010
But I still take a percentage of his winnings.

1342
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,370
Our money now.

1343
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:29,870
Our money now.

1344
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:30,930
That's exactly how Twitch works.

1345
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,390
Lowkey!

1346
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,490
We're still alive.

1347
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,490
Oh sweet, still alive of course.

1348
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,090
And the prize is Kha Klan just going crazy.

1349
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:39,890
And the prize is Kha Klan just going crazy.

1350
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:41,930
This is so funny.

1351
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:46,670
Only, I think if we had zone in any way, we definitely would have lived longer.

1352
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,990
Oh no, if we had zone, we could have like went to lava siphon, took balloon, you know what I mean?

1353
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,250
Yeah, we would have been so healthy.

1354
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,650
I wanted to get that RV pretty bad.

1355
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,550
We got that RV earlier where we could have killed an RV.

1356
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:58,710
Yeah, but we sort of lost somebody.

1357
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,150
Noko, he came out of the RV solo.

1358
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:02,930
Bro, I thought Noko was there.

1359
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,490
I didn't realize anyone was there.

1360
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,150
And I'm just nading the bridge.

1361
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,550
And then a Noko just comes out.

1362
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,070
And then...

1363
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,010
I have to mark him.

1364
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,070
Bro, the guy was so confident.

1365
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,670
I thought it was a full team, so I went to the side.

1366
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,610
No, I mean, we did it.

1367
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,430
We obviously did a good job.

1368
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:19,110
We got in there and killed him.

1369
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,970
Realistically, I should have got a kill on the Gibraltar up top too.

1370
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,410
I almost one killed him like for like a thousand levels.

1371
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,050
Probably the only time I'll have a good shot today.

1372
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:28,390
It's okay.

1373
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,870
This is our peak, guys.

1374
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,590
This is the best gameplay you're going to see out of all of us.

1375
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,150
This is the start of the damage.

1376
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,070
We get plus one kill after every game.

1377
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:38,370
We get plus one kill after every game.

1378
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:38,730
Which means...

1379
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:41,210
There's no way we can be last because...

1380
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:42,270
Nothing kills game six.

1381
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,090
There's no way we can be last because we already started out strong with kills.

1382
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:47,330
I don't know why.

1383
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,890
I was hoping someone would mis-pick a legend.

1384
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,150
And they'd get minus five.

1385
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,210
And then they'd get like bottom five.

1386
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,410
And then their scoreboard is just negative.

1387
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,550
Did anyone mis-pick a legend?

1388
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,410
There must have been one person.

1389
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:02,070
They said they were going to restart if...

1390
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,890
Bro, what the fuck, babies?

1391
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:07,910
20 teams up.

1392
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,130
59 players alive.

1393
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,430
Okay, nice.

1394
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,170
We didn't restart.

1395
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:13,650
I mean, not nice.

1396
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:15,910
Not nice.

1397
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,090
They're already two people over advantage.

1398
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,410
It's called survival of the fittest.

1399
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,870
We were able to...

1400
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,650
We were able to connect.

1401
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:30,530
We were able to evolve to what we are.

1402
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,990
We didn't survive the fittest.

1403
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,110
I did not do this tournament so ImperialHow can make more money.

1404
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,690
He's buying me dinner.

1405
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,270
You should not invite him.

1406
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:41,810
That would go so well.

1407
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:43,230
Thank God.

1408
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,170
We'll take second place.

1409
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:45,390
Wait, wait.

1410
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,490
It's like everybody's invited except for Hal.

1411
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:51,950
That was like...

1412
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,290
Having those comps were kind of fun.

1413
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,250
I kind of like seeing the legend.

1414
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,050
That was a good time.

1415
00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:01,210
I can't believe I got hit with a sentinel and then a repeater when I died like that.

1416
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:01,970
That was so fast.

1417
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,750
I don't know.

1418
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:08,170
I feel like even if I trusted you, Wig, we would have still died.

1419
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,070
They won't.

1420
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,590
I don't know.

1421
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,810
Even if I trusted you and we ran at the same time...

1422
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,290
You would have still died.

1423
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,150
I don't know because I got...

1424
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,730
Yeah, probably.

1425
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,610
They were already heading towards you.

1426
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:21,910
They were.

1427
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,250
Yeah, Hal scanning a duo is just...

1428
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:25,770
It's GG's.

1429
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,530
I think he just literally started foaming out of his mouth.

1430
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,470
He was so ready for it.

1431
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,230
He scans us and he just swipes us for sure.

1432
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,390
Damn you, Tempo.

1433
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:37,970
My god.

1434
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:38,690
That's fucking awesome.

1435
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,270
Who was charge rifling?

1436
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:47,730
Who was it?

1437
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:53,870
It was me.

1438
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:54,810
I'm going to take credit.

1439
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,130
Oh no.

1440
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,630
Peep got DC'd?

1441
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,410
Fuck, that sucks.

1442
00:48:59,450 --> 00:48:59,890
We didn't restart?

1443
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:03,970
Did I ask for a non-mode or does it not matter?

1444
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,650
No, it doesn't really matter.

1445
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,790
No, no.

1446
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,050
Don't ask for it.

1447
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,350
It'll be more fun.

1448
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,550
I already did it.

1449
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,330
I need to go to their channels and clip them raging.

1450
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:16,530
Oh my god.

1451
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:19,270
I need to know who I'm killing.

1452
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,230
His little YouTube compilation.

1453
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,890
He's going to make the pros rage at me.

1454
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,250
Apex Legends compilation.

1455
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:32,610
You won't believe which pro got angry at me.

1456
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,770
You won't believe which pro got angry at me.

1457
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,190
I'm going to help you with the clickbait titles.

1458
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,650
You're so good at that.

1459
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,720
Did we get our subs?

1460
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,580
Oh, they announced it?

1461
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,800
Okay.

1462
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,980
Oh, I can do catalyst.

1463
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,360
I'll do the controller.

1464
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,820
Oh wait, they announced the legends?

1465
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1466
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,820
Valk, Seer, Newcastle, and Conduit.

1467
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,660
Because Doki is going cat.

1468
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:12,720
Yeah.

1469
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,840
We have Valk!

1470
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,060
Wait, wait, wait.

1471
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,600
That means you can take Octane and I'll take Valk.

1472
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,100
Do we trust Temple or Valk?

1473
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,720
What is that?

1474
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,800
Wait, who played Valk when we played last time?

1475
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,820
That was me.

1476
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,360
You played Watson and Doki played...

1477
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,540
Well, yeah, Doki played...

1478
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,460
What did I play?

1479
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,540
Bang.

1480
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,720
Oh, yeah, but Bang's nerfed, right?

1481
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,100
Yeah, she's not bad though.

1482
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,740
Wait, isn't the Bang smoke something something?

1483
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,960
Wait, isn't the Bang smoke something something?

1484
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,180
You said two words, and then the words that mattered was not there.

1485
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:55,300
You said two words, and then the words that mattered was not there.

1486
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,900
Did something change?

1487
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,360
I just don't know what the something was, okay?

1488
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,560
A lot of things changed, Temple.

1489
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,780
You gotta be more specific.

1490
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,360
Alright, my brain is telling me I should play Valk when my heart is saying Octane.

1491
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,940
You should listen to your brain.

1492
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,960
The times you've listened to your heart.

1493
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,700
Oh, you're still right.

1494
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,320
My heart told me to pick you guys, and my brain was like, what the fuck are you doing?

1495
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,940
So maybe I should have listened to my brain in that situation.

1496
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,700
We're not last place.

1497
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,560
Just so you know, your heart picked us.

1498
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,560
You're right.

1499
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,100
My heart did pick you guys, which is the right choice.

1500
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,000
Octane next game, who are you guys playing?

1501
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,900
Then I'll take Valk.

1502
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,420
Wait, next game, okay.

1503
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,980
And then I'll do Catalyst.

1504
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,900
Yeah, you can do Bang, whoever you're comfortable with.

1505
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,080
Alright, I'll do Catalyst.

1506
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:45,920
We need zone readers.

1507
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,400
Yeah, this could be a good zone.

1508
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,660
When I am the rational one in this team, that's when you know things are bad.

1509
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,180
Oh wait, my Valk has a...

1510
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,620
No, it's the challenges.

1511
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,740
My Valk is locked.

1512
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,860
Wait, has Valk...

1513
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,220
Did I give you 10 subs yet?

1514
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,220
No, I'll do it after.

1515
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:07,880
Oh, okay.

1516
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,500
Every time you get a kill, it's a plus 5.

1517
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,160
Just remember that.

1518
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,400
Temmo, he's going to literally fund your lifestyle.

1519
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,520
Wait, what map are we on?

1520
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,940
We're on Storm Point.

1521
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,360
Storm Point?

1522
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,300
Okay.

1523
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,740
Storm Point we're going Command.

1524
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,780
Can we get Valk gold out of that, right?

1525
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,480
Yeah.

1526
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,420
Oh, we're good.

1527
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:29,920
We're so good.

1528
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,840
We're so healthy.

1529
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,060
I was trying to pick my Valk.

1530
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,500
My skin.

1531
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,760
Oh yeah, I need to pick my skins.

1532
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,540
I'm trying to make it blend into the wall.

1533
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,700
Okay, you're right.

1534
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,420
I need to rearrange my badges.

1535
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,940
Oh wait, my Valk badge.

1536
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1537
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,260
I was going to play...

1538
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,940
I already forgot what I was playing.

1539
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,700
Okay, banner.

1540
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,920
Don't worry.

1541
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,120
I'm going to make sure everybody knows what rank I'm in.

1542
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,660
Oh, I almost queued up for rank.

1543
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,680
I just want you to know, I have zero kills on Catalyst.

1544
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,840
I think I also have zero.

1545
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:15,940
Wait a minute.

1546
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,680
Wait, wait, wait.

1547
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,200
I was too busy with Jeb Burton.

1548
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:21,980
What did you just say?

1549
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,740
I have zero kills on Catalyst.

1550
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,540
Zero cat kills.

1551
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,980
I hate it.

1552
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,360
I hate it.

1553
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,140
And you chose Cat over Bang?

1554
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:30,740
Yeah.

1555
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,220
What is Cat's passive?

1556
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,620
She can lock doors.

1557
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,360
She can throw out the spikes.

1558
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,860
She can throw out the spikes.

1559
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,180
She can lock the doors.

1560
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,980
Lock the doors is crazy.

1561
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:53,480
Yeah.

1562
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,600
Technically it's locking doors.

1563
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,580
Yeah.

1564
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:10,120
And then she can put up a wall and and she looks slay while doing it.

1565
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,200
She does look slay, to be honest.

1566
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,660
I'm so happy Trick2G is playing, bro.

1567
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,680
I used to watch Trick2G every day in League.

1568
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,120
When I was an avid League player, I wanted to fucking cry every day.

1569
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,780
That's who I watched.

1570
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,880
Oh yeah, that's what I was going to say.

1571
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:31,620
You played League.

1572
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,520
I was going to say like, are you okay?

1573
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,560
Are you okay?

1574
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,700
Two years playing, Silver 2 Peak.

1575
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,340
You're not out of the box.

1576
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,020
Silver 2 Peak?

1577
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,440
Yeah.

1578
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,220
You're like that... oh wait.

1579
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,760
I don't know if I can say it.

1580
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:55,960
You're like that one guy that was Silver or something and he played League his whole career and then and then he tried to own an esport org.

1581
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,140
You know, that guy.

1582
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,980
Sam Baikman-Fried?

1583
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,100
Yeah, the crypto dude?

1584
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,620
He just got 25 years in jail.

1585
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,760
Yeah, I saw that.

1586
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,360
I was just sure we could talk about him because Tempo's here.

1587
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,820
Oh, true.

1588
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,500
Yeah, true.

1589
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,900
What was the point called?

1590
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,260
FTX?

1591
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:15,940
FTX, yeah.

1592
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,900
Hey Tempo, what was it called again?

1593
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,760
Tempo, you remember that coin that had a deal with TSM?

1594
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,220
Yeah.

1595
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,120
That guy.

1596
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:31,580
You know, the one that's been apparently bronze or whatever after 10 years of League.

1597
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,400
So then he decided to own an esport org.

1598
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,500
That guy.

1599
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,940
Well, it's a good thing we could talk about it.

1600
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,620
Yeah, you should be able to openly talk about this.

1601
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,940
It's okay, Tempo.

1602
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,700
That whole shit is actually crazy.

1603
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,920
Yeah, I'm surprised.

1604
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,300
Like...

1605
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,720
I'm surprised he almost got away with it.

1606
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,840
Until he got 25 years in prison.

1607
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,380
I don't even know if that's enough though.

1608
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,620
That was like the biggest heist ever.

1609
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,280
Yeah.

1610
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,300
He almost got away with it too.

1611
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,960
And we went for this meddling kids.

1612
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:09,600
And we went for this meddling kids.

1613
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,600
I'm trying to pull that out again.

1614
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,420
35 million.

1615
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,920
35 years.

1616
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,700
Yeah, he made an entire esport org to change their fucking name.

1617
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,380
Yeah, and he also paid off for fucking, um...

1618
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,720
There was like a basketball team, I think.

1619
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:25,300
Oh yeah!

1620
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,720
With crypto!

1621
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1622
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,300
Crazy.

1623
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,380
He did everything with that money.

1624
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,860
That's actually insane.

1625
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,080
He did everything with that money to actually do what he was supposed to do.

1626
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:34,940
I'm back, guys.

1627
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,660
We're in like ninth place.

1628
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,260
We're top ten!

1629
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,640
We're like tied for ninth.

1630
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,460
There's like five people with four points.

1631
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,400
Nice.

1632
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,480
We got this.

1633
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,640
Alright, wait, what?

1634
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,160
What?

1635
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,140
I was...

1636
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:54,540
They started showing the standings and I was so invested to see where we were.

1637
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,720
I completely zoned out.

1638
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,780
That's good, that's good.

1639
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,980
We were talking really great about TSM.

1640
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,200
Oh, okay.

1641
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,320
That's good.

1642
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,600
Yeah, don't worry.

1643
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,800
We're hyping TSM up.

1644
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,500
So you won't get fired.

1645
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:09,740
Never.

1646
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,820
About that?

1647
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,200
Hello?

1648
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,120
Something you didn't tell us or what?

1649
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,500
Whoa, Temple.

1650
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,580
Temple, what happened?

1651
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,680
Can I sleep on your couch?

1652
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,940
I told you, bro.

1653
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,460
Lan, my couch is yours.

1654
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,160
What?

1655
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,720
I got you on warm milk at night if you need.

1656
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,460
Bro, was this before us?

1657
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,660
Morning juice box and everything.

1658
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:34,840
I got you, dude.

1659
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,480
You'll actually be treated like a king in my apartment.

1660
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,000
Holy shit.

1661
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,100
He didn't have a blanket.

1662
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,000
He had to use one of the pillows as a blanket.

1663
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,580
I'm taking all your juvie.

1664
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,680
Are they kicking you out of the house?

1665
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,040
No.

1666
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,080
This is for Twitch Rivals.

1667
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,960
Are you going to LAN?

1668
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:55,760
No.

1669
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,180
Wait, is that in LA?

1670
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,160
Yeah.

1671
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,260
What date is it?

1672
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,800
May 2nd.

1673
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,360
Okay, that's like a far.

1674
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,000
I still have time to think about it.

1675
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,280
When am I going to be on your fucking B stream?

1676
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,820
When can I roll up?

1677
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,280
Literally roll up on an iPad?

1678
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:16,540
Yeah, obviously.

1679
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,560
You gotta actually buy one of those.

1680
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,400
No, Tempo's gonna buy it for me.

1681
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,440
Huh?

1682
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,720
The most broke one out of the three?

1683
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,360
I thought you had a plan.

1684
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,060
Don't you have a million subs on YouTube?

1685
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,060
No, no, no.

1686
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,240
I'm not a million.

1687
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,340
I'm a poor...

1688
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,820
I'm very tiny.

1689
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,200
I'm a very tiny streamer.

1690
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,160
I just started a month ago, guys.

1691
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,520
I just started a month ago.

1692
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,560
Oh, so true.

1693
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,980
You're brand new to this.

1694
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,180
Yeah, I'm brand new.

1695
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,100
I'm just a natural entertainer.

1696
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,800
Good for you.

1697
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,040
You didn't get the kill though, man.

1698
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,580
What's wrong with you?

1699
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:55,940
I don't know.

1700
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,240
I have no idea.

1701
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,160
He typed it, not me.

1702
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,020
Also, I thought, Tempo, I thought you had the setup already.

1703
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,000
Because you were going to do it on Last Land.

1704
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:03,700
What happened?

1705
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,580
I didn't buy it.

1706
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,860
I didn't buy the roller coaster thing.

1707
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,940
Of course you didn't buy it.

1708
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,140
You didn't even buy it?

1709
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,200
You literally told me like, Oh, TSA won't let me do it.

1710
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,700
I have the iPad.

1711
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,360
Yes, he has the iPad.

1712
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,940
I have the tablet.

1713
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,660
I need the rolly thingy with the wheels.

1714
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,960
Ask EA to buy it.

1715
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,420
We'll make it off as a business expense.

1716
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,180
That is so smart.

1717
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,840
We all have good connections with EA staff.

1718
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,820
Yeah, let me go talk to Chen.

1719
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,820
Yeah, we can literally convince them.

1720
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,580
Because it's in LA instead of London.

1721
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,260
So we don't have to get a plane.

1722
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,240
We can return it to the respawn H2 actor.

1723
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,300
Exactly, and then they can reuse it every time I want to butt in.

1724
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:40,920
Oh.

1725
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,220
You can playtest with the rolling iPad.

1726
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,080
She's gonna fucking go straight into me.

1727
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,500
Terrorize all the staff that are working.

1728
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,080
We need to pay attention here.

1729
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,060
We might be conned, guys.

1730
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,300
We're gonna be conned?

1731
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,600
We have no beacon.

1732
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:02,540
Again?

1733
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,000
What the fuck is the point of paying attention?

1734
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,140
We have no beacon character.

1735
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,220
Of course we have no beacon.

1736
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:09,740
We didn't pick a control character.

1737
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,340
We're just rolling.

1738
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,780
No, I mean a map scan.

1739
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,180
Oh, oh, wait.

1740
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,760
Wait, there's someone like...

1741
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,360
No, I'm Kallus.

1742
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,000
Kallus can scan maps.

1743
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,320
Yeah, you are.

1744
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,500
You're literally the fucking casting.

1745
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,400
I'm watching, I'm watching, I'm watching.

1746
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
You watch so many Apex streams that you still don't know who's the controller.

1747
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,600
I forgot you were on Tat, bro.

1748
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,500
I forgot.

1749
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:36,220
Oh my gosh, we have the...

1750
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,640
Don't you forget it.

1751
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,720
Where are you guys?

1752
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,780
I'm so confused.

1753
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,200
I have a jump tower, guys.

1754
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,640
We're so set.

1755
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,780
On me, on me, on me.

1756
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,420
Wait, what?

1757
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,020
I told you, I knew it.

1758
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,500
We're actually getting contested?

1759
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,000
No way I'm getting contested in my own tournament.

1760
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,560
Yeah, what the fuck, they saw us.

1761
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,480
That fucking command?

1762
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,380
I see one all the way up there.

1763
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,540
We wanna get height, that's the problem here.

1764
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,600
Wait, can we just not...

1765
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,140
Can we not take this now?

1766
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,920
No, I don't think we can.

1767
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,900
They're covering it.

1768
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,040
Bro, they're taking it right now.

1769
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:13,800
My audio's off.

1770
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,300
Your audio?

1771
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,600
My audio's back on.

1772
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,220
You have no audio?

1773
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,520
Where's someone we can rotate to that has it?

1774
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,140
I forgot I lowered my...

1775
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,080
You didn't ping the charge rifle.

1776
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,180
I'm sorry, I was a little bit confluxed.

1777
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:28,940
He's at 6x.

1778
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,260
Oh, 6x.

1779
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,280
Oh, I'm rich!

1780
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,420
Alright, I don't have...

1781
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:37,960
Alright, they're leaving.

1782
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,380
We're gonna go over to where they were.

1783
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,280
And we're gonna go on the zip line again.

1784
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,940
We wanna take height, we definitely do.

1785
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,280
I'm right behind you.

1786
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,660
If anything happens...

1787
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,080
That's fine, thank you.

1788
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,980
If anything happens, we can not craft you.

1789
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,800
Cause we don't have that.

1790
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,440
They're still here.

1791
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,880
Did they shoot you, Tempo?

1792
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,100
They shot you?

1793
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,500
They're pushing this.

1794
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:00,420
Go back, we don't wanna fight this.

1795
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:00,700
Just leave.

1796
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,680
Going through this door then?

1797
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,520
Don't worry, I'm gonna lock the door.

1798
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,300
I just don't know if the zone's going this way and we're gonna get ran at.

1799
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,480
Cause the zone actually looks like it could be.

1800
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,260
Let's take this house to our right side right now.

1801
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:13,380
Alright.

1802
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:16,500
I'd rather just be safe.

1803
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,560
And just go to wall later.

1804
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,020
We can grab the...

1805
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,000
The cash thing after.

1806
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,160
Yeah, I'm down.

1807
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,380
Okay guys, I haven't played Catalyst in a while.

1808
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,760
So how many spikes can I throw?

1809
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,180
Back, back, back, back.

1810
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,260
Back, back, back, back.

1811
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:33,780
Yeah, just go down.

1812
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,160
I'm just gonna...

1813
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:36,920
I'm heading down.

1814
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:39,900
We're so messy.

1815
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:40,980
Why is there...

1816
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,300
Oh shit, I just went straight up.

1817
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,980
Don't die there, please.

1818
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,540
Alright, we're gonna play for here right now and see what goes on.

1819
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,820
We got the evil cash here as well.

1820
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:49,720
Suck it.

1821
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,200
There's definitely someone that could be posting up coming to us.

1822
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,820
I'm locking the door.

1823
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:56,560
Yeah, yeah, just shut up right now.

1824
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,000
Fuck it.

1825
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,620
We're getting hoed right now pretty hard.

1826
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,000
And I'm locking this door.

1827
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,400
These people do not like us apparently.

1828
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:05,540
It sucks.

1829
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,600
This guy is for this.

1830
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,020
I am like not confident right now.

1831
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,940
Wait, we got the evil cash, right?

1832
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,380
Actually, we're not in like a bad spot regardless of where the sound goes.

1833
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:13,960
So we should be fine.

1834
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,880
But what about our loot?

1835
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,460
Aw, yeah.

1836
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,720
We can go over to wall after this and just probably get the evil cash.

1837
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,380
I don't see...

1838
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,840
Someone was shooting us from here, but I don't see them anywhere.

1839
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:25,460
Yeah, I don't know either.

1840
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,380
I have like no long range, so I'm just gonna...

1841
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,360
Oh, there's a longbow here for anybody.

1842
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,920
I would take that ammo.

1843
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,360
I'm gonna run this then for long range.

1844
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,540
I dropped a vault.

1845
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,720
If anyone wants a vault.

1846
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,100
I have a vault already.

1847
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,660
This team is not staying on the height of that building which is making me think it's not going here.

1848
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,540
Oh wait, someone just landed on top.

1849
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,040
Yeah, it's making me think it is going over there, which is pretty good.

1850
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,160
I think we just stay in this house then for now.

1851
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,460
Yeah, let's just not waste any loot because we...

1852
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,000
Don't have a lot of it.

1853
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,040
Yeah, we're free.

1854
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,940
We're pretty poor right now.

1855
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,140
Anyone kind of like to donate loot to us?

1856
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,480
Please, we need it.

1857
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:03,420
Please.

1858
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,520
If anybody stream sniping us.

1859
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,980
Wait, Doki, do you have Qs at all?

1860
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,520
Yeah, but...

1861
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,020
Can you try to put one on the window just for the peek?

1862
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,220
Oh yeah, sure.

1863
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,180
Which one?

1864
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:16,560
Here?

1865
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,180
Wait, Iman, are you shooting someone that's going this way?

1866
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:20,840
Alright.

1867
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,520
That's not great.

1868
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,320
Is that alright?

1869
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:26,880
Yeah, for visual clutter it doesn't matter.

1870
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:27,500
As long as it makes it...

1871
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,860
Drop back down to...

1872
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:31,980
You're not on height anymore.

1873
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,120
I'm stressed, I'm stressed.

1874
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,920
Where are you stressed out about?

1875
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,020
We have good position.

1876
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,140
We should loot, but like...

1877
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,800
As long as they don't come in and kill us.

1878
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,240
Covering a cell.

1879
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,000
Yeah, only problem is we're just triple wiped.

1880
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,100
If someone shoots that they're gonna be like, ooh.

1881
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,920
Okay, then just don't get shot.

1882
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,040
Wait, we're in the cure packs.

1883
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,820
Can't we scan them?

1884
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,580
I tried, I didn't look quick enough.

1885
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,000
I'm an idiot.

1886
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,980
Oh wait, they're fighting in cascades.

1887
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,280
See if I can get a blue off of this.

1888
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,780
Yeah, try to farm some shit.

1889
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,240
Yeah, you farm for us.

1890
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,300
We're just gonna be here.

1891
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,120
Yeah, you get your shield up, buddy.

1892
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,400
Yeah, you're our sniper.

1893
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,960
I have four cells.

1894
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,720
Okay, I have some here.

1895
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:14,420
Oh my god, do you guys remember the strat that we were supposed to do last time?

1896
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,440
Where like...

1897
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,660
You know, remember the one where...

1898
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:20,340
We let Tempo drop wherever the fuck he wants.

1899
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,240
And then...

1900
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,440
I do remember that one.

1901
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,380
Let's go!

1902
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,680
We never did that strat!

1903
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,280
We didn't do that so bad.

1904
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,520
We did that last game today.

1905
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,740
We did that for...

1906
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,240
Oh shit!

1907
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,360
He's in that room!

1908
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,200
Of course.

1909
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,640
On roof, we're dead here.

1910
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,240
We're so dead.

1911
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,960
We need to go wall slot.

1912
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,220
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

1913
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,100
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

1914
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,920
I'm leaving.

1915
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:53,540
We should have made tempo.

1916
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,020
We should have made tempo.

1917
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,060
On top of the building, Tempo?

1918
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,080
Yeah, he was, by the way.

1919
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,040
Okay, they have no idea I'm here.

1920
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:02,900
I'm dead.

1921
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,920
Yes, it doesn't matter.

1922
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:06,860
Drop got me.

1923
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,100
I can't believe I'm standing here.

1924
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:09,920
They're sending us.

1925
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,420
They're pushing us.

1926
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,560
You run, you run.

1927
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,080
Let me die.

1928
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,860
You shouldn't have been a hero!

1929
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,240
Tempo won!

1930
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,400
We got 20 in Tempo!

1931
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:21,920
Tempo, we got...

1932
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,900
Tempo, man!

1933
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,100
We got last!

1934
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,040
Tempo!

1935
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:27,820
Tempo!

1936
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,480
Wait, we're not center zone.

1937
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,780
I'm not saying that.

1938
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,660
In that zone, we were.

1939
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,040
Oh, yeah.

1940
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,180
Tempo!

1941
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:40,900
20th place, bro.

1942
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,800
And no beacon for us again.

1943
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,200
Does this game hate us?

1944
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:51,120
Okay, what if, like, in our third game, we let Tempo land?

1945
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,400
We let Tempo go wherever the fuck he wants.

1946
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,820
No, because this next game is Olympus.

1947
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:58,880
And we have a good POI.

1948
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,760
We have phase drivers.

1949
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,760
We have infinite balls.

1950
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,940
Infinite balls.

1951
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,560
But what if we get contested?

1952
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:09,380
No, we might get contested.

1953
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:09,860
Yeah.

1954
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,120
I mean, it's because people see our names.

1955
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:14,980
Timmy is based there.

1956
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,240
Oh, fuck.

1957
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,700
We do not want to fight that guy.

1958
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:18,480
Wait, what?

1959
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,540
I thought you said we had good POI.

1960
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,260
Dude, what is this shit?

1961
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,820
What's going on?

1962
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,120
Let me go find some...

1963
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,800
Is there anyone that's free, Tempo?

1964
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:32,820
Apex.

1965
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,100
I can't believe it.

1966
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,660
That was so tough, dude.

1967
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,320
Super unfortunate.

1968
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,560
Wait, this is why you don't follow your heart.

1969
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,940
I mean, why am I getting contested at Command Center, bro?

1970
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,580
You followed your heart and then we got 20th place.

1971
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:55,560
At Command Center, no beacon and we're contested.

1972
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,980
My strategy is just fucked out the window there.

1973
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:02,400
Because the whole point is I wanted to get beaconed then Valko will come up there so we don't have to shoot for the rest of the game.

1974
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,640
We just know exactly where to go.

1975
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,820
Because Tempo is sitting on top of roofs.

1976
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,100
No comment.

1977
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,880
With his back...

1978
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,660
Wait, I was shooting someone.

1979
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,160
Yeah, but you shot... I got shot in the back.

1980
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:24,040
I was shooting cascades and then I don't know where those guys came from.

1981
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,640
And they were in the house next to us.

1982
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,040
Alright, we'll shoot with these guys.

1983
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:28,980
I found a map.

1984
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:30,800
Did we get zero points?

1985
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,620
It is zero points.

1986
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,080
Yes, we were 20th.

1987
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:37,640
I wasn't sure if we got a kill and Tempo worked some magic with that charge rifle.

1988
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,700
I wasn't sure.

1989
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:40,840
Get revenge.

1990
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,400
No one's good.

1991
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,260
Tempo, what's free?

1992
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,520
What's free for the next map?

1993
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,060
We're moving on.

1994
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:48,940
Memory like a goldfish.

1995
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,060
What's free?

1996
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,840
Where's Oasis?

1997
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,320
Oh, here it is.

1998
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,300
Next.

1999
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,740
What's free?

2000
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,900
Do we have anything?

2001
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,920
Is there...

2002
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,260
We should...

2003
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,480
Oh my god.

2004
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,600
I have an idea.

2005
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:13,900
If there's no spot free, we see who's the 20th place team and we land on them.

2006
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:15,060
That's us.

2007
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,360
No, I meant overall.

2008
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,340
Overall.

2009
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:21,980
Is that fucked up?

2010
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,200
That's not fucked up, right?

2011
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,340
No, no, no.

2012
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,860
We're weak and we're playing on the weaker.

2013
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:27,680
That's fair as fuck.

2014
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:28,960
It's strategy.

2015
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:34,180
If people can do that in pro league and fuck over other teams, we can too.

2016
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,460
There's no rules against doing that.

2017
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:39,560
There's no rules against doing that.

2018
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,980
Against sabotaging other teams.

2019
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,520
Yeah.

2020
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:48,080
Okay, so we just need to find out who's overall 20th place and then take their...

2021
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,680
then take their POI.

2022
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:50,840
I...

2023
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,080
I don't know if we can even be 20th place.

2024
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,500
There's no way.

2025
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,820
I think we are the 20th in terms of gun skill.

2026
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:01,260
No, no.

2027
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,920
There's one open POI.

2028
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:05,580
Turbine.

2029
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:06,920
Oh, that's good.

2030
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:07,980
Turbine.

2031
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:08,440
Let's do it.

2032
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:08,980
Let's get Turbine.

2033
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,280
Say Turbine in chat, please.

2034
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,460
Or, guys...

2035
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,620
Or, we can get three points.

2036
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,920
And land on the 20th team overall.

2037
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,320
But here's the thing.

2038
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,800
If we lose the 20th place team, what the fuck are we gonna do?

2039
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,420
Then we're the 20th place team.

2040
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,400
And then we become the 20th place team.

2041
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,700
Oh my gosh.

2042
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:32,220
Are you...

2043
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,680
Do you not believe in us, Wei?

2044
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,200
I believe in...

2045
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,560
Okay, do you not believe in me?

2046
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,160
No, no.

2047
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:39,820
I believe in you.

2048
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,600
You are a Plat 3 player, you know what I mean?

2049
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,200
Yeah, yeah.

2050
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,660
I'm pretty good for a Plat 4 player.

2051
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:47,480
Yeah.

2052
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,140
For a Plat 4 player, I'm pretty good.

2053
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,220
If we get, like, Tempo not to die, we're good to go.

2054
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:55,660
You know what I'm saying?

2055
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,380
That's true.

2056
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,000
Tempo got us two points last game.

2057
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,440
Yeah, yeah.

2058
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,100
That's the thing.

2059
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,900
We need him to be alive to farm points for us.

2060
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,880
We just need a...

2061
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,760
You know why that happened?

2062
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,500
Because I was on Valk and I was like, Oh, I can fly.

2063
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,500
And then I flew to the roof.

2064
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,260
This is why...

2065
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,000
If I was...

2066
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,040
If I was any other legend, I would not have been able to make it up on the roof.

2067
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:20,980
And I'd be like, fuck it.

2068
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,180
This is why you never listen to your heart.

2069
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,220
I was trying to be a good teammate.

2070
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,940
He was so excited to play Valk.

2071
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:29,720
I don't know what to say.

2072
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,260
To be a good teammate.

2073
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,240
You seem that you're like, I want to play Valk.

2074
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,840
No, because he wanted you to play Octane.

2075
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,060
Tempo was the one that was trying to be a good teammate.

2076
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:40,960
Tempo was the one that was trying to be a good teammate.

2077
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,600
Realistically, realistically, we want to be honest here.

2078
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,420
Tempo should be playing the controller characters.

2079
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:46,520
Okay.

2080
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:47,820
Okay, yeah.

2081
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:51,760
I'll take all the controllers.

2082
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,960
Unless there's a fuse.

2083
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,400
Okay, wait.

2084
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,980
Tell them not to add it.

2085
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,660
Put fuse in?

2086
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,700
Yeah, I might message them to say not to put fuse in.

2087
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:04,100
Tell them to remove all fuses from now on.

2088
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,180
Some of my chat says, you realize that Doki still has zero kills on cat?

2089
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,560
Yeah, do you still have zero kills on cat after that game?

2090
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,340
Zero kills on cat.

2091
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,640
Yeah, dude.

2092
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,120
Keeping that tradition.

2093
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,440
We're so torched.

2094
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,860
Why are there so many teams alive still?

2095
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,020
I don't know.

2096
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,460
That's because we died pretty early.

2097
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,740
We didn't even get the Valk ulti that game.

2098
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,740
We didn't even get any ulti.

2099
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,300
Guys, 20th place in my own tournament is crazy.

2100
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,200
This is crazy.

2101
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,860
We have to get at least 19th next game.

2102
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:39,340
We have to.

2103
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,260
We're not improving.

2104
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,440
What happened?

2105
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,300
No one's contesting next game.

2106
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,260
Guys.

2107
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:50,580
That's already one thing we don't have to worry about.

2108
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,920
That also means no one's going to die to me.

2109
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:56,400
That also means no one's going to die to me.

2110
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,780
We should tell everybody what our skins are so they won't run at us.

2111
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,480
We should tell everybody what our skins are so they won't run at us.

2112
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,500
Then we'll give them someone else's skin so they chase after them instead.

2113
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:03,540
Then we'll give them someone else's skin so they chase after them instead.

2114
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,000
That is so true.

2115
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:05,760
What is his team skins?

2116
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,580
Yellow bang.

2117
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:08,780
Bang.

2118
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,240
I'm now a yellow bang.

2119
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,000
I'll play yellow spins, I'm down.

2120
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:12,760
Or bright yellow.

2121
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:13,660
Or bright pink.

2122
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:15,960
No, no, we're giving people wrong...

2123
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,000
Wait, what map are we playing on?

2124
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,000
We're giving people other people's skin colors.

2125
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,620
My mom in the chat said, I'm back, what's happening?

2126
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,860
Mom, we just got 20th place.

2127
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:26,780
No, you could have lied.

2128
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:27,680
She wouldn't know.

2129
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,180
Mom, we got first.

2130
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,520
We got first last game.

2131
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,520
I think we're in...

2132
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,640
We were doing so well that EA staff told us to sit this one out.

2133
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,340
So other people can have a chance.

2134
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:39,860
We're watch -partying from inside the game now.

2135
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,760
I want to say right now that this is better than international scrims quality.

2136
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,360
14 teams alive on board.

2137
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,960
We have 14 teams alive after 12 seconds of the first game.

2138
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,740
People don't get money from scrims.

2139
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:51,860
Of course this is better.

2140
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,620
You're so right, you're so right.

2141
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,580
Money changes everything.

2142
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:56,880
Even if they did.

2143
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,220
Not for us though.

2144
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,640
Not for us.

2145
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,160
We're the content.

2146
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,380
There's not changing anything for us.

2147
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,740
We're literally content.

2148
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,560
No, Temple, you should start giving vouchers for your scrims.

2149
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,820
So people take it more seriously.

2150
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,620
Like a $5 coupon for something.

2151
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,260
A $5 coupon?

2152
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,740
We'll gift you a sub.

2153
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,100
We'll gift you 5 subs if you survive.

2154
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,540
Pass round 3.

2155
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,500
That's so true!

2156
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:23,280
That's so true!

2157
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,480
That's how we should do the payout.

2158
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,080
Yeah!

2159
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:30,480
Instead of overall placement, we should do 5.

2160
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,560
Pass round 3.

2161
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,300
For every round.

2162
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,800
For every round you survive, your team earns extra money.

2163
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,600
It earns like 5 subs.

2164
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,120
Per person.

2165
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,980
That would be financed by Wig.

2166
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2167
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,720
Make the bank account for everybody.

2168
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:59,780
Okay, but Wig, it'll give you better quality scrims, which means more viewers, more viewers in general, which means more income in general.

2169
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,660
So in the end, you're gonna gain money in the end.

2170
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,000
You're so smart.

2171
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,400
Viewers would want to watch better scrims because the scrims would be longer too.

2172
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,280
Yeah.

2173
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,680
And then you can run as many ads as you want.

2174
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,460
Sorry guys, I gotta run the ads now.

2175
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,780
Doki has a fascination with me spending money.

2176
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:28,660
She's like, listen, Tempo gets these kills, you just drop like 600 bucks each.

2177
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,840
It's not that big of a deal.

2178
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,600
It's motivation.

2179
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,440
Money motivates people.

2180
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,320
It's true.

2181
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,560
Look at right now.

2182
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,280
Look at the quality of this tournament.

2183
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,640
Because of money.

2184
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,680
This is the most motivated I've seen snipe down in a very long time.

2185
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:43,740
Whoa.

2186
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,000
Him not being relegated.

2187
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,580
Him being relegated probably didn't help.

2188
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,220
This is good.

2189
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,540
He's playing like he's 10 years younger right now.

2190
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,300
Oh yeah.

2191
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,160
And his eyes.

2192
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,400
And he just died.

2193
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,120
And he gets beamed across the fucking map, dude.

2194
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,580
You had to say regulated.

2195
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,800
There is no fucking way, dude.

2196
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:14,700
You just actually VTuber cursed him so hard.

2197
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,000
You're the one that mentioned his name first.

2198
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:18,920
What do you mean?

2199
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:23,380
I was talking about getting money motivation.

2200
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,360
But you're here.

2201
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:24,760
You're here.

2202
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:25,920
I'm here.

2203
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,100
I give the extra curse.

2204
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,020
Agreed.

2205
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,660
There's gotta be something along with VTubers and curses.

2206
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,560
They don't really make sense.

2207
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,140
No, I think casters give a better curse than VTubers.

2208
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,400
I will agree that I definitely give a harder curse.

2209
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,640
Yeah.

2210
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:38,880
For sure.

2211
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,740
I'll agree with that one.

2212
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:42,700
Holy shit.

2213
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,380
This is a hard zone.

2214
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:44,260
I'm gonna be honest, guys.

2215
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,180
I'm kinda happy we died.

2216
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:46,900
What do you mean?

2217
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:47,500
No.

2218
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,840
You're happy that we died 20th?

2219
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:50,980
Yeah, a little bit.

2220
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,980
Cause I don't think we would've We would've been on that house on the left side.

2221
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:55,880
Uh huh.

2222
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,700
We could've valked over there and got the house.

2223
01:16:58,980 --> 01:16:59,860
That would've been us.

2224
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,700
I just... I think the Tempo's just a boss for that.

2225
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,000
Just sitting on top of a roof like that is crazy.

2226
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,960
Yeah, with white armor, that was actually crazy.

2227
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,300
No, you're a piece of that.

2228
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,060
Like, all confidence, white armor.

2229
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,780
Did you not think you were on white armor?

2230
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:20,180
I mean, I don't think it would help.

2231
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,360
He was dead regardless if it was white or blue.

2232
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,320
If I had blue, I would've been alive.

2233
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:28,740
You were literally standing still, charged right?

2234
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:31,380
Tempo, your reaction time on that was crazy.

2235
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,780
How do you know?

2236
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,860
You didn't see anything.

2237
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,180
I looked up.

2238
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,360
And you were still in the same spot.

2239
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,920
I looked up and you were still standing still when you were getting shot.

2240
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,320
What do you mean?

2241
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

2242
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,420
I'm talking about you, Tempo.

2243
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:48,120
Jersey's off.

2244
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:53,300
Are you taking off your fucking shirt right now on stream?

2245
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,260
I'm ready.

2246
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,700
The day I stop playing is the day Tempo plays in a tournament where he's shirtless.

2247
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,780
Bro, he's shirtless right now.

2248
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,280
Look at this.

2249
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,480
Is that Toss?

2250
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,820
Can you play with your titties out?

2251
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:19,760
No, it'd be like those nipple stickers that they on Twitch.

2252
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,260
People who do it on Twitch for body paint.

2253
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:22,100
The pasties.

2254
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,820
How do you know the name of that?

2255
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,480
I've been doing it.

2256
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,200
How do you know the name?

2257
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,780
I used to watch makeup tutorials when I was younger.

2258
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,520
All the time.

2259
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:32,960
Really?

2260
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,260
Wait, really?

2261
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,400
Yeah, I was interested in makeup for a while.

2262
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:37,200
Oh, shit.

2263
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,120
So you had pasties on your nips?

2264
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,060
No, I do not wear pasties.

2265
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,080
Why not?

2266
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:45,540
I'm fucking naked.

2267
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,140
But you had a fascination.

2268
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,600
No, I was just interested with makeup.

2269
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,020
I was like, oh, these people are good at it.

2270
01:18:52,360 --> 01:19:01,280
Okay, if you put that as a goal, What, to wear pasties on the street?

2271
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:02,780
What, to wear pasties on the street?

2272
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:07,720
There is not a single goal that would get me shirtless with nipple tassels on my fucking skin.

2273
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:12,360
No, not like tassels, but just cover it as if you have no nipples.

2274
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,520
I would actually rather have tassels than anything else you have.

2275
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:21,140
Wait, wait, why would you not want to be nipple-less?

2276
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,880
I don't want to see what I look like like that.

2277
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,640
Oh my god, someone said you could make them spin.

2278
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,140
That's what I'm saying.

2279
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,380
Alright, we're back.

2280
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,200
What do you mean we're back?

2281
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,400
We've been here the whole time.

2282
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:40,680
I want to go grab...

2283
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,280
Wait, are you actually shirtless right now?

2284
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:45,720
No.

2285
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,420
Bro, no balls.

2286
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,860
No balls is crazy.

2287
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:50,820
No.

2288
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:53,240
Hey, wait.

2289
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:55,160
Oh no, he's dead.

2290
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,280
Oh god, who's winning?

2291
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,520
Just tell me who is winning.

2292
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,740
Well, not Drop's team.

2293
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,380
We just saw him got mowed down there.

2294
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,240
He got rocked.

2295
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,240
You gotta make sure I'm anonymous next game.

2296
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,140
Why?

2297
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,180
This is more fun.

2298
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,480
Jen Burner's team won.

2299
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:12,740
Of course he did.

2300
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:13,960
Of course.

2301
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,000
Wait, so you wouldn't...

2302
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,860
Why wouldn't you wear Pacey's?

2303
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:21,400
Why wouldn't you wear Pacey's?

2304
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,100
Why are you afraid of being nipple-less?

2305
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,700
I don't understand, Wig.

2306
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,160
I just don't want to see what I look like without it.

2307
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:29,560
I don't know.

2308
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:30,680
I'm down.

2309
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,000
I'm trying to do it on stream.

2310
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,680
I'm not trying to be like, no nipples on stream.

2311
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:39,120
I'm not even trying to show my nipples on stream.

2312
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,820
But it's not against TOS.

2313
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,460
No, I fully understand it's not against TOS.

2314
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,340
I'm not trying to show my nipples.

2315
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,560
But you won't be showing it because it won't be seen.

2316
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,220
Drop, bro, why did you do that?

2317
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,740
To poor tempo.

2318
01:20:55,620 --> 01:21:02,300
Man was scoped in 499 times charge rifling.

2319
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,420
Bro, people, your chat wants it.

2320
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:06,840
They want that content.

2321
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:07,760
Of course my chat wants it.

2322
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:08,980
They see me as a piece of meat.

2323
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:14,060
I bend over to turn my Christmas tree on and it's just non-stop fucking comments.

2324
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,600
Wait, is that why you have a Christmas tree on?

2325
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,140
So you can make an excuse to bend over?

2326
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,040
No, I should get a whiteboard though.

2327
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:20,200
Oh, you should.

2328
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,800
I'm going to go down for scrims.

2329
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,000
So every time you're like, Oh, this team won, you can bend over.

2330
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,460
You can turn around, bend over, Oh, look at these winners!

2331
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,740
Look at all these scrim winners.

2332
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,620
That's content right there.

2333
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,200
It is 100% content.

2334
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:41,040
I'm asking Drop how bad your reaction time was.

2335
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:45,000
Yo, the game doesn't count, okay?

2336
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,400
Because Anonymous Zone was supposed to happen but it didn't.

2337
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,020
So the whole game is...

2338
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:52,100
Oh my god, yes.

2339
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:53,200
The wipe thingy.

2340
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,940
Wait, tell them right now.

2341
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,320
If Prolly can do that, we can too.

2342
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,720
Since it's your tournament, this game doesn't count.

2343
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,060
Because anonymous mode was not on.

2344
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:01,600
Yeah.

2345
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,340
Wait, tell them that right now.

2346
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,140
Alrighty.

2347
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,620
What am I telling them?

2348
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:11,680
Tell them that because anonymous mode was not on when you told them.

2349
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:12,260
It doesn't count.

2350
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:13,400
It doesn't count.

2351
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,420
This game is wiped off.

2352
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:15,500
For sure.

2353
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:19,840
I think they're totally gonna listen to me after they've paid for everyone to be there for a certain amount of hours.

2354
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:24,100
No, I'll just... I mean, obviously, I think Doki's right.

2355
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,020
I'll just put another... I'll put like $20,000 of my own money into this.

2356
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:27,620
Exactly.

2357
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,020
Yeah, exactly.

2358
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,580
And then you can make it back by having a whiteboard.

2359
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:32,440
All you need to do is run one ad.

2360
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,280
You're a genius.

2361
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:33,800
You're a genius.

2362
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,400
Yeah, you can make it... One ad and you break even.

2363
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:35,960
Exactly.

2364
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,440
One ad, $20,000.

2365
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:37,940
One ad.

2366
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,400
You're like, maybe two ads.

2367
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:40,720
New legends.

2368
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:41,640
New legends.

2369
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,140
Maybe two ads.

2370
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:44,580
Ash boys.

2371
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,080
Oh yeah.

2372
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,960
I'm going to... Top Finder CryptoVantage Caustic Lifeline.

2373
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:51,420
Obviously, Tempo's caustic.

2374
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:51,820
Yes.

2375
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,700
We're on...

2376
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,280
Olympus.

2377
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:58,140
I need a white.

2378
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:00,400
All right.

2379
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,180
I mean, to be fair, the other ones are just whatever you're comfortable with, Doki.

2380
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:06,960
I'm down with anything.

2381
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,140
Honestly.

2382
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:11,480
I mean, we can do Lifeline just to crack people if Tempo dies.

2383
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,300
Wow.

2384
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,920
That's actually probably a good idea.

2385
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,400
Actually, if Wig dies, because you're the...

2386
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:17,740
Yeah.

2387
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,600
You're going to be taking most of the hits.

2388
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:25,160
I should probably play Path for rotational purposes.

2389
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:27,620
I'll play Path for our rotations.

2390
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:28,920
Zip lines and stuff.

2391
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:30,540
I'll play Lifeline for the crafter.

2392
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:31,560
Okay.

2393
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:32,200
You cool with that?

2394
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,080
Yeah, I'm cool with that.

2395
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:34,920
All right.

2396
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,800
Let me change my skin and badges.

2397
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,460
We're so locked in, guys.

2398
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,620
We're locked in.

2399
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:40,980
We're going to get a beacon and turbine.

2400
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,080
Because this map...

2401
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:43,840
Wish my lifeline...

2402
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,500
We don't have a beacon.

2403
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:45,960
All right.

2404
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:46,960
Okay.

2405
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:47,700
Lifeline.

2406
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,700
No, I need therapy after Tempo today.

2407
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:52,800
That's my dog.

2408
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,120
All right.

2409
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,280
I went to therapy once.

2410
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:56,400
I did too.

2411
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:57,380
Only once?

2412
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,480
Both of you guys should go more than once.

2413
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,240
Because you went once.

2414
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,260
Of course it didn't work out.

2415
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:04,760
Yeah.

2416
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:05,940
It was never going to work out.

2417
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:06,880
You don't know that.

2418
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,200
You need to find the right therapist.

2419
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,860
And the issues...

2420
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,600
are impossible.

2421
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,240
Whoa.

2422
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,580
What issues?

2423
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,280
Okay.

2424
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,100
You know what?

2425
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:19,740
Tempo, trauma dump on us right now.

2426
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,880
We're like, you are a sociopath.

2427
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:22,540
What?

2428
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,080
Wait, really?

2429
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:25,580
Okay.

2430
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,900
I was going to be like...

2431
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:31,700
Holy shit.

2432
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,520
And you were a teacher.

2433
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,800
Around children.

2434
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,760
You think...

2435
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:39,280
Wait.

2436
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,420
That's why I was...

2437
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:41,980
Wait.

2438
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,560
Teacher thing turned me into one.

2439
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,340
That's the way.

2440
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,240
Children can't turn you into a sociopath.

2441
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:50,420
You're...

2442
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,140
What is the 340...

2443
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,940
If we get contested at Turbine, we're so choked, guys.

2444
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,160
So we'll late drop Turbine?

2445
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,900
Because if someone tries to contest us at Turbine, it means another POI is open.

2446
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:05,260
Yeah.

2447
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,080
There's one team per POI right now.

2448
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:08,960
We'll just late drop.

2449
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:13,720
And if someone contests us, we'll destroy 2009 their PC.

2450
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:20,030
No one's doing Turbine, I don't think.

2451
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:21,210
There's no one doing Turbine.

2452
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:22,030
So we're fine.

2453
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:26,570
If someone swerves...

2454
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:27,150
Yeah.

2455
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:28,610
Guys.

2456
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:32,590
Guys, we should make a team Paranoid.

2457
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:34,470
Who's like the 20th team overall?

2458
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:35,510
And what is it going to be like?

2459
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:36,870
We'll just pretend we're going somewhere else.

2460
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:38,670
Are we 20th?

2461
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:39,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2462
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:43,610
I want to make a team Paranoid by saying we're landing on their POI.

2463
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:45,210
So you think they're getting contested.

2464
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:47,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2465
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:47,550
Leaderboard.

2466
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:49,230
Who's last right now?

2467
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:49,590
Who's last?

2468
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:51,090
No, that's 5Head.

2469
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:55,750
Because then someone will try and kill us off drop, and then everyone will think there's three teams.

2470
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:58,490
But then they'll really be contesting the other team?

2471
01:25:58,690 --> 01:25:58,950
Yeah!

2472
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,630
I'm big braining this right now.

2473
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:03,570
Who's the 20th team and what's their POI?

2474
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:04,550
I'm looking at the leaderboard.

2475
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:07,630
I mean, I'm waiting for the leaderboard to get updated.

2476
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:08,950
POI.

2477
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:11,150
Website.

2478
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,210
Guys, I'm going to be honest.

2479
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:15,390
Can I say a statement that we might not like here?

2480
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:15,850
Okay.

2481
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:20,590
Wait, what is it?

2482
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:24,050
I did not believe in us for Challenger Circuit at all.

2483
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:26,150
And I'm going to be honest.

2484
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:27,130
Oh thank god you said that.

2485
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,450
Wait a minute.

2486
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,830
Wait a minute.

2487
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:31,730
I believe in us less.

2488
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:35,610
I'm glad you said it.

2489
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:37,210
Because I don't have it.

2490
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,090
We're going to be going against...

2491
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:43,490
We're against makeshift teams right now.

2492
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:43,970
Okay?

2493
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:47,170
When we go to Challengers, we're going to be against teams that have been playing together for a little bit.

2494
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:49,810
Yeah, and I've been scrimming and everything.

2495
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:54,610
But people who are playing on a touchpad that have been playing together are still not going to be able to hit anything.

2496
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:57,390
So you think these people are playing on iPads in Challengers?

2497
01:26:57,610 --> 01:26:58,570
They're on the Switch.

2498
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,950
They joined the Challengers.

2499
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:02,950
Oh no, not that they're actually...

2500
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:05,010
I think they're actually playing on a Switch.

2501
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:06,810
But they might as well be playing on a Switch.

2502
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:08,430
They can't hit anything.

2503
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:09,270
Oh I see.

2504
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,130
For sure.

2505
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:11,910
No, no, no.

2506
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:14,730
They're uploading the scores right now.

2507
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:15,610
Where?

2508
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:17,950
There's no way.

2509
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:18,810
That's so sad.

2510
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:20,130
We have four points.

2511
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:20,950
We have to be last.

2512
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:22,130
Don't say that.

2513
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,390
There's like ten teams below us.

2514
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:28,310
Find the scores over here.

2515
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:31,090
Please select final results.

2516
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:32,730
Don't say that.

2517
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:34,270
There has to be a team.

2518
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:41,210
They haven't uploaded the scores.

2519
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:45,450
Okay, let's just look at the current last place team and say their POI.

2520
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:46,690
Oh, final results.

2521
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:47,310
Alright.

2522
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:51,150
How the fuck Timmy is last place right now?

2523
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:52,110
Yeah, we're in ninth.

2524
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:54,130
We were in ninth.

2525
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:54,950
No, not yet.

2526
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:56,050
That's round one.

2527
01:27:57,630 --> 01:28:00,290
There's three teams with zero points.

2528
01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:02,830
It's Timmy, We The People, and Kian.

2529
01:28:03,970 --> 01:28:04,370
Okay.

2530
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:05,130
Yeah, I can deal with that.

2531
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,750
Alright, wait.

2532
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:06,590
Where is...

2533
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:07,770
Where are they landing?

2534
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:08,910
I'm gonna look at where they're landing.

2535
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:10,450
Timmy was landing phase.

2536
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:12,490
Kian's team's really good.

2537
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:13,390
I'm not trying to land on them.

2538
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:15,210
Who's Kian's team?

2539
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:16,070
Terminal.

2540
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:18,910
Is Terminal on...

2541
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:21,210
Is Terminal the third map?

2542
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:22,510
Wait, what's their third map?

2543
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:24,970
Is Terminal the third map, Doki?

2544
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:26,270
I know.

2545
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:26,830
That's the drop spot.

2546
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,310
She's more confused than I am.

2547
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,070
We're playing Olympics, Doki.

2548
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:33,370
I was gonna say, is Terminal in Olympics?

2549
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:35,970
Okay, we're landing Terminal.

2550
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:38,410
We're landing at Terminal.

2551
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:43,290
What if they land on Turbine now, thinking we're going Terminal?

2552
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:44,090
No, they won't.

2553
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:47,230
I said we're landing Terminal.

2554
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:48,430
There's no way.

2555
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:51,530
If they do that, we're fucked.

2556
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,790
There's no way.

2557
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:53,750
They're at the last place.

2558
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:54,050
Oh, wait.

2559
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:54,670
They have Kai.

2560
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:55,230
Never mind.

2561
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:55,730
I'm scared.

2562
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:59,430
I'm at the last place.

2563
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:00,250
We just got back.

2564
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:01,610
I have no idea how they're last.

2565
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:02,850
They're good.

2566
01:29:04,190 --> 01:29:05,590
It's not updated yet, though.

2567
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:07,570
And they have a control player, too.

2568
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:09,750
No, no, no.

2569
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:10,150
They're staying.

2570
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:10,890
They're staying Terminal.

2571
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:11,970
They're staying.

2572
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:17,070
And you die to us in Terminal Law.

2573
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:24,010
Okay, I'm just...

2574
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:26,210
I'm baiting him.

2575
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:26,810
I'm baiting him.

2576
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:27,890
I'm baiting him right now.

2577
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:32,950
Okay, so hopefully Sweet goes over there and kills Kai.

2578
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:34,810
And then we'll get 19.

2579
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:39,090
We're so close.

2580
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:40,970
I'm landing on you, Wig.

2581
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:41,310
Great.

2582
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:42,470
Peep just PC'd.

2583
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:44,850
Start the game.

2584
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:46,450
No, no, no.

2585
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:49,390
Sorry, buddy.

2586
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:50,270
Start it.

2587
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:50,770
Start it.

2588
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:54,130
Bro, you're such a snitch, Wig.

2589
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:58,590
Wig, the vibes were all high until Tempo got his head taken off.

2590
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:02,650
I rewatched.

2591
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:05,170
Rewatched what?

2592
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:07,310
He rewatched the fucking clip.

2593
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:11,810
He reacted 20 seconds after.

2594
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:15,050
Bro, what the fuck, Tempo?

2595
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:19,610
He reacted It wasn't 20 seconds, okay?

2596
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:20,890
It was like 10.

2597
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,930
How does that make him better?

2598
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:25,830
Hey.

2599
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:27,910
10 seconds.

2600
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:29,990
That is very fast.

2601
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:32,350
10 seconds reaction time.

2602
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:33,990
Did you have a 6 times or a 4 to 8?

2603
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:37,490
I got a 6.

2604
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:39,890
Yeah, 6.

2605
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:40,830
It's not my fault.

2606
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:41,490
It's a 6x.

2607
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:44,110
It's not my fault.

2608
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:44,570
Yeah.

2609
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:47,770
Guys, it's not his fault, guys.

2610
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:49,570
Don't worry, we'll make it back.

2611
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:54,650
Alright, let's get to... let's get to 15 points.

2612
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:55,790
So we need what?

2613
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:56,390
11?

2614
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:56,890
11.

2615
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,590
11 is so doable, guys.

2616
01:30:58,730 --> 01:30:59,570
11 points?

2617
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:00,990
We need a gunpoint.

2618
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:02,730
Okay, we need 6 kills in 4th place.

2619
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:03,650
Yeah.

2620
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:08,110
We need a beacon and we need an evac tower.

2621
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:10,410
I had an evac tower!

2622
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:11,610
You did?

2623
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:13,130
Yeah, I told you guys!

2624
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:16,370
I know, but we got stuck on command, bro.

2625
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:20,390
How did they get into command if we went in the middle?

2626
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:21,950
Because they went frontside.

2627
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:22,790
They went frontside.

2628
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:27,030
Because we went through the butthole.

2629
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:29,790
They might not come back next time.

2630
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:30,790
They might not come back next time.

2631
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:34,470
Alright, we're playing there again.

2632
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:36,990
Wait, we have somebody missing on the far right.

2633
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:40,670
Wait, that means that I can see where in Stormpoint is.

2634
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:42,630
Who said that sucks start?

2635
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:47,270
I just got jury duty.

2636
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:47,950
Have fun, man.

2637
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,770
Are you supposed to go to jury duty, like, yearly?

2638
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:52,850
No.

2639
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:53,670
You can pretend.

2640
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:55,990
You get RNG'd for jury duty.

2641
01:31:56,170 --> 01:32:02,030
Yeah, you get RNG'd for jury duty and then you can tell them that you're not competent enough to be in it.

2642
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:03,510
Just say you're stupid and...

2643
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:08,710
What if you could, like, get on a really crazy intense big case?

2644
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:09,390
That would be scary.

2645
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:11,990
That's why you don't take the case.

2646
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:13,770
No, no, that's why you take it.

2647
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:15,890
That's why you take it and then you manipulate everyone.

2648
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:19,270
Here's how to get out of jury duty.

2649
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:20,150
Okay, as a...

2650
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:23,450
Not an American, but, like, this is how you get out of it.

2651
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:24,430
Wait, wait, wait.

2652
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:25,790
Pathfinder?

2653
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:26,410
Yeah.

2654
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:27,310
Lifeline.

2655
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:30,090
Okay, what are you playing?

2656
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:31,050
Plastic.

2657
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:31,430
Wait.

2658
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:33,830
In Canada, what?

2659
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:35,450
You gotta say something.

2660
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:43,150
Okay, as I was saying, like, to get out of jury duty, if it's, like, something that's, like, a really high prolific case, you can be like, I sympathize with the murderer.

2661
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:46,770
And then you already have, like, a bias towards the...

2662
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:48,970
And then they're like, oh, I guess we can't have you.

2663
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:51,790
Yeah, cause you have to be in jury duty, you have to have no biases.

2664
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:53,030
At all.

2665
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:56,030
So you can just be like, I don't know, I think he could be a...

2666
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,410
I think he was a nice guy.

2667
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:58,930
I think he's a nice guy.

2668
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:05,090
So you get out of jury duty!

2669
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:05,850
Cause you're supposed to have...

2670
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:07,890
Why don't you just say that to the victims instead?

2671
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:09,270
Like, I sympathize with them.

2672
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:14,170
Well, you don't say it to the victims, you say it to the judge, cause they're picking the people who are doing jury duty.

2673
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:15,330
No, you're not even...

2674
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:19,650
Yeah, so they won't know you said that, you know?

2675
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:21,010
Only the victims will know.

2676
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:21,470
True.

2677
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:23,610
Only the judge will know.

2678
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:27,950
And then they'll be like, we can't put you in jury duty because you already have a bias towards the murderer.

2679
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:30,110
I don't think you have to worry at all, Dokie.

2680
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:32,830
I don't think you're ever getting picked based off these statements you said.

2681
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:34,150
Never.

2682
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:35,490
They're watching.

2683
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:36,690
They're watching you now.

2684
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:39,590
Take this seriously and show us OG wig?

2685
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:39,930
What do you mean take this seriously?

2686
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:40,770
That is a joke, guys.

2687
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:41,950
This is a joke.

2688
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:43,750
It's not a joke.

2689
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:44,070
Get her.

2690
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:45,090
It's a joke.

2691
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:46,210
It was a joke, guys.

2692
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:48,430
For legal reasons, this is a joke.

2693
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:48,790
No.

2694
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,090
For legal reasons, she's being serious.

2695
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:50,630
Take this seriously.

2696
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:53,510
Do not take my advice.

2697
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:55,470
Minus tempo on Caustic.

2698
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,130
Wait, we don't have a beacon again.

2699
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:58,390
I'm gonna fucking cry.

2700
01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:58,670
Again?

2701
01:33:58,890 --> 01:33:59,630
I might cry.

2702
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:00,090
I might cry.

2703
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:03,030
Just jump right now before someone just jumps.

2704
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:06,750
Before somebody tries to take Why am I jumping?

2705
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:10,490
Before somebody takes Turbine from us.

2706
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:11,090
Yeah, please.

2707
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:12,390
We need something in this world.

2708
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:12,670
Yeah.

2709
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:15,870
How do we not have a fucking beacon again?

2710
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:19,330
This game actually wants me to go last.

2711
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:20,010
Guys, I don't want this.

2712
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:21,610
I don't want to be bottom five, guys.

2713
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:25,390
What did you just say?

2714
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:28,930
I don't want to be bottom five, guys.

2715
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:29,530
I don't want to be bottom five, guys.

2716
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:30,250
No, that's for sale.

2717
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:32,710
No, that shit is gone.

2718
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:33,630
What are you talking about?

2719
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:34,870
We are bottom five for sure.

2720
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:35,750
No.

2721
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:37,410
No.

2722
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:38,450
What happened?

2723
01:34:38,510 --> 01:34:40,630
We used to be so good at this game.

2724
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:41,830
What happened?

2725
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:46,190
We were supposed to do Challenger Circuit.

2726
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:46,890
We were supposed to do Challenger Circuit.

2727
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:47,990
You are still doing it.

2728
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:49,210
Yes.

2729
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,210
I don't know.

2730
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:52,790
I don't have high hopes anymore.

2731
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:54,670
I never had high hopes to begin with.

2732
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:56,670
I can't believe you said that actually.

2733
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:58,430
I'm low key impressed that you said that.

2734
01:34:58,650 --> 01:34:59,170
Hey, Tempo.

2735
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:00,090
Please.

2736
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:02,350
Just do that.

2737
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:04,170
I pinged it too.

2738
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:05,650
Oh my god.

2739
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:09,250
Wait.

2740
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,050
I have the perfect excuse.

2741
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:13,070
I'm categorized as platformer.

2742
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:14,370
You guys should have been carrying me.

2743
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:15,710
Of course.

2744
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:17,470
You guys should have been carrying me.

2745
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:19,270
This is so embarrassing.

2746
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,530
Tempo, based on this zone.

2747
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:23,350
I mean, no offense.

2748
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:24,710
Where do you think this is going?

2749
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:27,730
He should know because he watches so many scrims.

2750
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:28,710
Yeah, Wig.

2751
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:29,850
You should know because you watch so many scrims.

2752
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:31,450
Both of you guys should know.

2753
01:35:32,290 --> 01:35:33,270
That's what I'm saying.

2754
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:34,930
Why just me?

2755
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:37,450
That's true, actually.

2756
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:40,090
I want to go into Energy Depot.

2757
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:40,930
But there's a team there.

2758
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:42,130
We should just keep walking up towards this.

2759
01:35:42,430 --> 01:35:43,490
I'm following Wig.

2760
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:46,050
You make the yellow dots and I just follow.

2761
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:46,650
Okay.

2762
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:47,930
Let's start moving.

2763
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:49,630
I have no idea where the zones are going.

2764
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:50,270
God.

2765
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:53,830
Now I know why no one picked Turbine.

2766
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:55,010
This loot sucks.

2767
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,110
Honestly, my loot is pretty good.

2768
01:35:57,150 --> 01:35:58,010
We got scammed by a social beacon.

2769
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:00,090
Oh, they're far.

2770
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:03,730
I lose pretty dog shit.

2771
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:05,630
I have no attachments on anything or bats.

2772
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,290
I'm going to get a bat right now, though.

2773
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:08,470
I'm not great.

2774
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:09,050
I'll be honest.

2775
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:10,250
So you lied.

2776
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:12,450
I'm not bad.

2777
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:16,010
You literally said your loot was pretty good.

2778
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:16,670
Did I say I was good?

2779
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:19,110
You said your loot was pretty good.

2780
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:19,850
Let's go Energy Depot.

2781
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:20,310
Let's go this way.

2782
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,550
We're going to move up.

2783
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:24,290
Oh my god.

2784
01:36:24,330 --> 01:36:25,050
I fucking need that.

2785
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:25,450
Fuck me.

2786
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:26,350
Just pick it up.

2787
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:26,730
Pick it up.

2788
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:29,870
Just go up there.

2789
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,290
Tempo, you go up there first.

2790
01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:33,790
And just watch out.

2791
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:36,350
Wait, they're fighting behind us.

2792
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:36,890
Come back here.

2793
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:37,230
Come back here.

2794
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:38,910
Get in front of me.

2795
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:39,150
Get in front of me.

2796
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:39,910
Okay.

2797
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:41,570
Come on.

2798
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:42,570
Where?

2799
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:43,390
Where?

2800
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:44,330
Go back up.

2801
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:44,850
Go back up.

2802
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:45,270
Okay.

2803
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:45,570
Okay.

2804
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:46,930
I'm turning around.

2805
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:47,970
We got a point.

2806
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:48,410
We got a point.

2807
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:49,890
It's time to leave.

2808
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:51,730
We're not last.

2809
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:54,730
We should leave.

2810
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:55,450
We shouldn't be there.

2811
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:56,230
Go back down.

2812
01:36:56,430 --> 01:36:57,090
Go back down.

2813
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:57,990
Yeah.

2814
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:01,430
Wait for my zipline.

2815
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:03,350
We're going to go across the small building over here.

2816
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:03,710
Come here.

2817
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:03,990
Come here.

2818
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:04,270
Come here.

2819
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:07,190
Take this.

2820
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:07,810
We're not going to die.

2821
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:08,290
Okay.

2822
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:08,490
Okay.

2823
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:09,030
I didn't hesitate.

2824
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:09,810
I didn't hesitate.

2825
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:10,250
I didn't hesitate this time.

2826
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:11,190
Good.

2827
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:11,790
Nice.

2828
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:12,110
We're valid.

2829
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:12,610
See, we're good.

2830
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:13,190
We're going to play here.

2831
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:13,950
We're going to play here for right now.

2832
01:37:14,410 --> 01:37:15,290
Don't stand on the roof.

2833
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:16,350
Don't stand on the roof.

2834
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:17,190
Tempo.

2835
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:17,570
Tempo.

2836
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:18,350
No roof action.

2837
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:19,870
There's a 4x.

2838
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:20,330
Oh, wait.

2839
01:37:20,350 --> 01:37:20,910
I need that actually.

2840
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,930
He's a 2x4 for me.

2841
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:23,330
Well, wait.

2842
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:23,790
This is nice.

2843
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:26,030
I'm dropping a 2x.

2844
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:27,510
Okay.

2845
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:27,910
I don't need it.

2846
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:28,150
We're good.

2847
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:30,690
There are a lot of people rotating in over here.

2848
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:31,350
I don't know where this is going.

2849
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:34,050
42 damage and a kill.

2850
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:35,150
Guys, we're not last.

2851
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:37,350
We're 19th last.

2852
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:40,930
We're at like one point right now.

2853
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:42,210
Tempo, this is going to be for you.

2854
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:42,470
Okay.

2855
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:44,390
Okay.

2856
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:46,410
We need you to get us blue armor.

2857
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:48,770
Why is no one getting this care package?

2858
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:50,450
Did you scan the care package already?

2859
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:51,390
I did.

2860
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:51,690
Yeah.

2861
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:52,990
They got it.

2862
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:00,470
We're doing it.

2863
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:02,190
I'm so proud of all of us.

2864
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:04,430
Oh my god.

2865
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:05,690
Here you go.

2866
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:07,290
You don't need a heal, Tempo.

2867
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:09,290
I will give you one little heal.

2868
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:10,850
Yeah.

2869
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:13,490
Great job.

2870
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:14,210
Good job.

2871
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:16,930
We're not wasting meds.

2872
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:18,990
Alright.

2873
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:19,410
We're good.

2874
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:19,750
We're good.

2875
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:21,410
We'll make a play.

2876
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:23,810
I heard a Crypto.

2877
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:25,430
They're over here.

2878
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:27,710
There's a lot of people rotating towards us.

2879
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:28,950
That's why I'm confusing where the zone is going.

2880
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:30,570
I'm scared.

2881
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:32,590
What if they come to us from behind?

2882
01:38:33,170 --> 01:38:33,570
No.

2883
01:38:33,610 --> 01:38:33,910
We're fine.

2884
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:36,570
I want to put some traps out here, buddy.

2885
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:37,790
Maybe a little bit farther up.

2886
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:39,510
So we know they walk up on us.

2887
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:39,990
Yeah.

2888
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:40,710
Exactly.

2889
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:41,730
Oh my god.

2890
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:42,370
We're so smart.

2891
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:43,310
You're getting it.

2892
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:43,870
You're getting it.

2893
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:44,430
You're understanding.

2894
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:46,170
We're getting there.

2895
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:47,730
We're figuring this out.

2896
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:51,450
I don't see anybody yet.

2897
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:54,370
I hope they kill more people.

2898
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:58,250
So we can be like 18th place.

2899
01:38:58,610 --> 01:38:59,610
We shouldn't be on the roof.

2900
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:01,070
It sounds so much better than 20th.

2901
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:01,450
It's insane.

2902
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:01,810
Yeah.

2903
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:02,110
I know.

2904
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:05,310
For some reason, 18th place sounds like a lot better than me in 20th place.

2905
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:06,330
It sounds fantastic.

2906
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:08,070
I'll take 18th place all day.

2907
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:08,970
I know.

2908
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:11,170
I'm not using this two times if no one wants it.

2909
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:13,590
I have a 2x4.

2910
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:14,170
I don't need it.

2911
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:15,230
Okay.

2912
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:16,590
My bad.

2913
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:21,610
I'm so sorry.

2914
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:23,410
I don't know where to go.

2915
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:24,490
We're good.

2916
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:24,870
We just wait.

2917
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:25,450
We have a re-deploy.

2918
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:28,350
I have a Moby.

2919
01:39:29,150 --> 01:39:30,170
We don't have a re-deploy.

2920
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:31,070
I do have a zipline.

2921
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:32,750
Efficiency.

2922
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:34,510
We can make this work.

2923
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:35,690
18th place.

2924
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:36,330
18th place.

2925
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:37,010
Let's go.

2926
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:42,070
I'm saying if it goes towards the garden, our rotation is not that bad.

2927
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:43,970
There's still a guy here.

2928
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:44,470
Oh, I see him.

2929
01:39:46,090 --> 01:39:46,930
Green Pathfinder.

2930
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:47,650
Okay.

2931
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:52,170
Someone type in this chat right now to not push us.

2932
01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:53,930
It's so real for that.

2933
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:55,090
Max, stay still.

2934
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:57,190
We have some collision going, so I never...

2935
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:02,930
There's no rules in Twitch Rivals about colluding.

2936
01:40:04,110 --> 01:40:05,630
They never said no colluding.

2937
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:08,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2938
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:11,110
Let's see how bad my zone call was, yeah?

2939
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:13,010
We got scanned.

2940
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:15,410
We got surveyed over here.

2941
01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:16,510
I don't know.

2942
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:17,310
Feel free to roast, though.

2943
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:17,850
Let's see how it goes.

2944
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:20,290
Guys, for legal reasons, that's a joke, guys.

2945
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:21,390
Do not go to the chat.

2946
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:24,790
Do not go to the chat.

2947
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:27,090
Because I think he'll actually push us now that he knows we're there.

2948
01:40:27,290 --> 01:40:29,170
Do not go to the chat.

2949
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:29,830
Alright, we gotta go Rift.

2950
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:30,170
We gotta go Rift.

2951
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:30,770
Come, come, come, come.

2952
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:35,170
And then just a whole team just flew in.

2953
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:35,810
We're so chocked.

2954
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:37,090
Oh, no.

2955
01:40:37,730 --> 01:40:38,890
A whole team just flew in this building.

2956
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:39,930
And this building passed.

2957
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:42,470
I wanna go next if we can.

2958
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:44,590
I'm gonna push that one down.

2959
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:44,990
Come here, come here.

2960
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:45,770
Okay.

2961
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:47,670
Oh, there's a team here.

2962
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:48,270
Fuck me.

2963
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:49,050
Go back, go back, go back.

2964
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:49,430
We can't go this way.

2965
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:52,830
We literally can't go this way.

2966
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:54,530
I have a...

2967
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:58,430
I'm gonna drop down my lifeline package.

2968
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:02,250
Maybe we'll get something here.

2969
01:41:02,570 --> 01:41:03,490
Okay, you guys stay here.

2970
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:04,190
Yeah, yeah.

2971
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:04,890
You guys are gonna get loot.

2972
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:05,830
Get EvoCache for yourselves.

2973
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:06,110
Yeah.

2974
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:08,130
I'm gonna go check up on Energy Depot until we can rotate.

2975
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:08,970
Just stay down here.

2976
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:09,490
One second.

2977
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:10,510
I'm gonna skip out the scenes.

2978
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:12,210
There was no EvoCache, by the way.

2979
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:12,730
It was just...

2980
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:14,170
Was there an evac tower on that or no?

2981
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:14,490
Nope.

2982
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:16,030
There was nothing.

2983
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:18,350
There was a purple heavy mag.

2984
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:19,090
Yay!

2985
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:21,810
Wait, they're still behind us!

2986
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:23,830
Wait, where are you?

2987
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:24,590
Where are you?

2988
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:25,070
Where are you guys?

2989
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:26,690
Come over here.

2990
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:27,010
Come over here.

2991
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:27,450
Come over here.

2992
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:27,710
Come over here.

2993
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:28,530
Tembo, keep running.

2994
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:28,750
Keep running.

2995
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:29,090
We'll go over here.

2996
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:29,570
Everybody, keep running.

2997
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:31,690
No!

2998
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:32,910
Why me?!

2999
01:41:33,390 --> 01:41:34,790
Why is it me?!

3000
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:36,130
I'm dead too.

3001
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:37,430
It's time to go.

3002
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:38,150
It's time to go.

3003
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:39,110
Run, run, run.

3004
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:40,190
You can craft this.

3005
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:41,250
You can craft this!

3006
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:42,910
This is exactly why I went lifeline.

3007
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:45,550
This is exactly why How does that happen?

3008
01:41:45,610 --> 01:41:46,810
How do we get walked up on?

3009
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:48,250
I'm getting shat on?!

3010
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:49,250
I'm dead.

3011
01:41:49,790 --> 01:41:50,190
Bro!

3012
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:51,330
Bro!

3013
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:54,050
What the fuck is this, man?!

3014
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:57,330
Bro, when are we gonna get a fucking evac?!

3015
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:59,950
We haven't got one evac!

3016
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:02,210
And we haven't got a fucking beacon!

3017
01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:04,070
Wait, wait, we got a kill though.

3018
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:05,290
So it's not a zero.

3019
01:42:05,310 --> 01:42:06,550
We got one point.

3020
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:08,970
We got one kill.

3021
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:11,790
Not a single evac.

3022
01:42:12,150 --> 01:42:13,930
Not a single beacon.

3023
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:15,890
I'm going to lose it.

3024
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:19,930
I literally did not hear anything for the team that walked up on us, to be fair.

3025
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:20,990
To be fair.

3026
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:23,730
Cause that's not even the team that killed you guys that just killed me.

3027
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:25,130
It's a completely different squad.

3028
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:27,350
Wait, your squad is already on red.

3029
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:29,850
With 34 damage.

3030
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:33,850
Bro, that was Max's team too.

3031
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:35,550
I'm so sad.

3032
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:38,010
How do I...

3033
01:42:38,650 --> 01:42:39,930
How do we not get a beacon?

3034
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:43,310
How do we not get a single scan in three games out of Command Center?

3035
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:46,290
Or fucking Turbine?

3036
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:49,290
All I'm saying is like...

3037
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:53,030
I think we need to let Tempo roam free and maybe we'll kill him.

3038
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:53,150
Yeah.

3039
01:42:53,570 --> 01:42:54,890
I might just make you...

3040
01:42:55,130 --> 01:42:58,290
I might make you play a controller legend and you just literally land on a beacon somewhere.

3041
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:03,010
And if you make it to us, by the time we get a zone, we're good.

3042
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:03,870
We're so good.

3043
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:05,990
I swear, this is like the best strat.

3044
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:07,650
We let him roam free.

3045
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:13,310
You literally land on one of those where you scan it across the map and you just meet up with each other.

3046
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:14,810
Wait, what map is next then?

3047
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:17,170
Next is going to be Geyser again.

3048
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:18,690
But Geyser...

3049
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:19,650
That's what I'm saying, bro.

3050
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:21,570
Geyser, we should have a beacon somewhere, man.

3051
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:23,010
Oh no, not even Commanders League.

3052
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:24,330
I'm going to play a 90% and fuck it.

3053
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:26,090
I'm losing it, I'm losing it, I'm losing it.

3054
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:31,190
Bro, I just want to get into one fight, like an actual fight.

3055
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:32,970
I know, I want a beacon to endgame.

3056
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:35,670
This is crazy.

3057
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:36,170
This is insane.

3058
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:38,410
Guys, okay, okay.

3059
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:41,810
Tempo, I believe in you to be free.

3060
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:43,690
Be free, Tempo.

3061
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:48,890
I can't believe it.

3062
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:54,470
I actually... I can't believe we got walked up on and Tempo, I didn't even hear anything.

3063
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:57,250
We didn't hear the walk up at all.

3064
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:59,770
I have no idea how it's possible, dude.

3065
01:44:01,230 --> 01:44:02,730
Release him from his shackles.

3066
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:04,510
Why is that team walking up on us?

3067
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:06,730
It was Mac's team.

3068
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:08,330
It was Mac's team.

3069
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:10,190
I fucking knew he was going to kill us.

3070
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:11,390
Different fucking team.

3071
01:44:11,410 --> 01:44:13,310
It was two teams that pursued our building.

3072
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:16,550
Oh my god.

3073
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:17,050
That is insane.

3074
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:20,370
Now I understand sweet dreams frustration not getting beacons.

3075
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,790
Insane.

3076
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:25,130
It's nice that you're doing a watch party in your own tournament.

3077
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:25,650
I'm banning you.

3078
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:27,150
Oh my god, three.

3079
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:29,310
This is like your own tournament too.

3080
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:31,870
Why is your own tournament so fucked up?

3081
01:44:32,730 --> 01:44:35,230
Why is it so cursed against you?

3082
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:36,210
Why do they hate us, bro?

3083
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:36,990
Why do they hate us?

3084
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:37,370
That's what I'm saying.

3085
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:37,830
Okay, we're back.

3086
01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:39,410
What do you mean we're back?

3087
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:40,310
We were already back.

3088
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:42,070
It can't be my own tournament and then we have a good time.

3089
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:44,910
For those that know, we're going to have a good time.

3090
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:45,330
It's okay.

3091
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:45,870
It's okay.

3092
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:50,110
Those teams that are winning right now, they're not having as fun as we are.

3093
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:52,230
Do you think that's actually true though?

3094
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,610
They might be winning.

3095
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:57,610
Do you think that's true?

3096
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:01,850
Do you believe that with your whole chest?

3097
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:06,810
They might be winning, but they're not having as fun as we are.

3098
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:08,670
That could be more true.

3099
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:09,130
I agree.

3100
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:13,830
Because somehow I'm rage induced, but I'm just having a great time.

3101
01:45:17,050 --> 01:45:18,230
Just remember that.

3102
01:45:18,810 --> 01:45:19,890
Winning isn't everything.

3103
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:25,970
They might win more money and be more financially secured.

3104
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:27,290
But...

3105
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:29,330
What did we do?

3106
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:30,530
We laughed more.

3107
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:31,530
But...

3108
01:45:32,350 --> 01:45:33,890
But homies for life.

3109
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:36,970
Actually, homies for life.

3110
01:45:38,350 --> 01:45:39,670
Aren't they dead?

3111
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:40,290
Oh, they go to the corner.

3112
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:48,150
Those teams that are doing much better than us and they are winning, you know they won't be back together after this tournament.

3113
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:50,550
Also, like, they're fucking nerds a little bit.

3114
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:50,990
Am I right?

3115
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:51,870
Yeah, they won't.

3116
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:54,410
Yeah, they're fucking nerds.

3117
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:55,490
How dare they be good at a video game?

3118
01:45:58,330 --> 01:46:02,830
You know they won't reconvene back together and do a reunion or anything.

3119
01:46:02,970 --> 01:46:04,470
They're going to forget each other the next day.

3120
01:46:04,830 --> 01:46:05,270
Yeah.

3121
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:06,210
But we won't.

3122
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:07,290
We're relatable.

3123
01:46:07,510 --> 01:46:08,350
Chat, how did that...

3124
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:09,530
Is this making you feel better, Chat?

3125
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:15,570
We're like the team where it's like if we can be in a tournament, so can you.

3126
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:17,830
Anything is possible for you guys.

3127
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:26,830
If they are allowing us to play this tournament with all these pro players who are infinitely better than us, that means you can too one day.

3128
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:28,350
Wait, wait, wait.

3129
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:30,750
I'm included in that?

3130
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:33,810
I don't know about infinitely better.

3131
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:38,450
I won't say though.

3132
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:41,670
After those shots I just gave them, they're definitely infinitely better.

3133
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:43,170
I just gave them 14 warning shots.

3134
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:44,870
I don't think I just gave them 14.

3135
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:45,750
See, you're so relatable.

3136
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:48,650
You're so relatable.

3137
01:46:49,330 --> 01:46:50,990
I'm just down to earth, you know what I mean?

3138
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:52,210
Yeah, exactly.

3139
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:53,070
You're humans.

3140
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:57,210
When Chat watches other pro players, they're like, oh my god, these shots are inhumane.

3141
01:46:57,390 --> 01:46:58,110
That's what I'm saying.

3142
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:59,970
There's no way he's able to...

3143
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:03,230
But then when they watch you, they're like, oh yeah, he's definitely a real person.

3144
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:04,430
That can be fun.

3145
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:07,670
He's definitely a player from Apex Legends.

3146
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:09,390
I shit just like you guys.

3147
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:13,190
Yeah, and people will be like, oh my god, he's on controller and still missing?

3148
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:14,290
So relatable.

3149
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:26,230
I have a secret plan.

3150
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:27,530
What's your secret plan?

3151
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:31,210
There's two teams contesting at Harvester.

3152
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:32,610
So?

3153
01:47:33,230 --> 01:47:34,330
What does that mean for us?

3154
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:36,430
We're literally on Geyser.

3155
01:47:36,430 --> 01:47:38,690
I'm a third king of Harvester.

3156
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:40,190
I'm Geyser.

3157
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:40,570
We're not bad.

3158
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:43,350
You know exactly what...

3159
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:45,930
You know exactly what that means.

3160
01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:47,490
What the fuck does that mean?

3161
01:47:47,530 --> 01:47:48,730
We need some KP.

3162
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:51,730
There's no way we're gonna be able to get there from Geyser.

3163
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:53,170
We're both getting shot at.

3164
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:56,470
Okay, is Temple gonna...

3165
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,470
Temple, you can third party them for us.

3166
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:00,650
I'm going Geyser for sure.

3167
01:48:00,650 --> 01:48:01,230
Wait, wait, wait.

3168
01:48:03,170 --> 01:48:04,390
Great idea, guys.

3169
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:06,350
Wait.

3170
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:07,590
You two land Geyser and loot.

3171
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:11,850
I'll land Harvester and try to sneak like a free kill or two.

3172
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:12,710
And then I'll run away.

3173
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:15,950
And then I'll loot No Name.

3174
01:48:16,050 --> 01:48:17,730
And then I'll meet up with you guys at Geyser.

3175
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:20,430
If he fails, we have...

3176
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:21,830
We can craft him at Geyser.

3177
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:23,030
Yeah, we can craft him at Geyser.

3178
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:23,910
That is so smart.

3179
01:48:26,110 --> 01:48:27,650
That looks like us out there.

3180
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:28,390
That was crazy.

3181
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:30,690
I was thinking it was Strat.

3182
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:33,130
No, I had...

3183
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:35,330
I had max POV there.

3184
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:37,850
Okay.

3185
01:48:37,990 --> 01:48:38,410
Okay, yeah.

3186
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:40,950
I mean, we are sending Temple out to roam.

3187
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:42,710
So, Temple, you're gonna land on Harvester.

3188
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:44,250
Oh, my game crashed.

3189
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:46,450
Wait, it didn't crash.

3190
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:49,030
My Discord reset itself, but I'm okay now.

3191
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:49,690
Yeah.

3192
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:55,140
We have a plan.

3193
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,960
We have guaranteed one kill plan.

3194
01:48:57,320 --> 01:49:00,020
We're just gonna let Temple roam free around the map.

3195
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:03,100
I'm gonna go third Harvester.

3196
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:04,940
And then Suicide.

3197
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:06,860
And then you guys craft me at Geyser.

3198
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:07,880
And then bring me back to life.

3199
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:10,160
Yeah, that's the best plan you've ever had.

3200
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,060
Should guarantee us one kill.

3201
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:13,980
Yeah.

3202
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:15,500
And then we're back in the game.

3203
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:18,120
I don't know about back in the game, but yeah.

3204
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:19,300
Back in the game.

3205
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:25,320
See, now I'm kinda happy we didn't play this zone again.

3206
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:25,900
You know what I mean?

3207
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:27,880
I think you're just coping.

3208
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:29,760
Nah, never.

3209
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,280
I think you're just coping.

3210
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,760
Nah, this makes sense.

3211
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,160
Playing this zone has been way too difficult.

3212
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:38,520
I'm not kidding.

3213
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:40,940
I actually went 0 for 7 on Sentinel shots to cover for you guys.

3214
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,780
I said I'm covering for you guys and I did not cover once.

3215
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:44,660
I'm covering.

3216
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:45,520
We ran up.

3217
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:45,900
We died.

3218
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:47,260
That's why we're so relatable.

3219
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:48,800
Thank you.

3220
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,680
People watch us for the relatability.

3221
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:51,240
Yeah.

3222
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:57,360
People don't wanna watch a robot.

3223
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:59,780
They wanna watch somebody that can make mistakes.

3224
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:00,660
Yeah.

3225
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,720
They wanna just feel like...

3226
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,100
Is it a mistake?

3227
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,500
Do you make mistakes?

3228
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,000
Despite how many they make.

3229
01:50:14,490 --> 01:50:16,070
Look, I'm saying as a team.

3230
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:16,690
As a team.

3231
01:50:18,090 --> 01:50:19,750
I'm not singling out...

3232
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:22,770
I'm not singling out anybody here.

3233
01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:27,290
But if anyone wants to give out examples of how they made mistakes, that's on them.

3234
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:28,390
For sure.

3235
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:30,850
I can't think of a mistake for my end.

3236
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:31,770
But like...

3237
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:32,410
Oh no, never.

3238
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:34,910
We never know.

3239
01:50:36,050 --> 01:50:37,190
That's cause you don't make them.

3240
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:43,310
If anybody else wants to tell what mistakes they made, that's totally fine.

3241
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:45,390
Tempo, if you wanna open up bro, we're not gonna try.

3242
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:47,870
Yeah, you wanna open up too Tempo.

3243
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:49,890
Zero mistakes.

3244
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:53,450
Oh, zero mistakes.

3245
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:54,290
Oh, okay.

3246
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:55,330
Then we know.

3247
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:56,590
Zero is a little delusional.

3248
01:50:57,690 --> 01:50:58,950
Just a little.

3249
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:01,150
I like how when I was like, I don't remember my mistakes.

3250
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:02,190
You're like, yeah, you're right.

3251
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:05,070
And then for Tempo it's like, oh, you're delusional.

3252
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:06,470
I don't remember what happened.

3253
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:07,830
Why can't you put that down?

3254
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:08,970
It went out the window.

3255
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:13,310
Double Moby is crazy and we can't even find an Evac fucking tower.

3256
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:14,610
We can't even find...

3257
01:51:14,610 --> 01:51:17,910
There was no fucking anything in my package.

3258
01:51:18,170 --> 01:51:19,270
I got a purple Evac.

3259
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:20,130
That was great.

3260
01:51:20,430 --> 01:51:21,630
And they got double Moby.

3261
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:24,690
And we can't find a fucking Evac.

3262
01:51:27,530 --> 01:51:27,930
Unreal.

3263
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:29,090
Okay.

3264
01:51:29,570 --> 01:51:30,710
All our luck.

3265
01:51:30,930 --> 01:51:32,790
I think it's because you're the tournament organizer.

3266
01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:35,310
Every fucking luck is not with us.

3267
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:36,790
That's low key true though.

3268
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:39,650
I feel like I actually cursed myself by being the organizer.

3269
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:41,250
What?

3270
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:42,850
You should...

3271
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:44,030
Okay, you know what would have been funny?

3272
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:47,290
Honestly, Greek should have been a caster in your tournament.

3273
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:51,570
Honestly, they asked me if I wanted to play or cast.

3274
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:53,730
I don't think I regret my decision yet.

3275
01:51:53,930 --> 01:51:59,650
I feel like it would have been so funny that Greek would have casted you in your own tournament.

3276
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:02,230
In my own?

3277
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:03,010
That would be so fucked.

3278
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:08,500
That would be so fucked.

3279
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:09,720
That would be so fucked.

3280
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,000
Just make him watch.

3281
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:14,760
Yeah, just make him do a watch party.

3282
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:17,580
Yeah, just make him do a watch party.

3283
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:18,460
That would be so fucked.

3284
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:19,080
That would be so fucked.

3285
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:22,760
Wait, whose team is this?

3286
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:23,860
Oh my god.

3287
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:24,860
You still casted Dvar.

3288
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:25,780
Hey, wait a minute.

3289
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:27,440
How come I can't...

3290
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:28,980
Can't what?

3291
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,340
It's anonymous mode.

3292
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:35,460
They did trust us.

3293
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:38,260
It's been on this entire game.

3294
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:40,280
What do you mean?

3295
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:41,440
I didn't notice.

3296
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,880
And a self-revive on Lifeline is crazy.

3297
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:47,880
That boy Janja will win.

3298
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:49,080
I'm kind of happy about that to be honest.

3299
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,080
You know what?

3300
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,260
We know the plan, right?

3301
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,480
Don't let him land on Harvester.

3302
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,080
You can just craft me.

3303
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:58,820
We can craft him.

3304
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:01,020
I'm down.

3305
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,560
It's the smartest thing we can ever do.

3306
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,080
That's like guarantee one point.

3307
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:10,020
Make sure you know they're going there though.

3308
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,400
I just need a fuse.

3309
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,460
No, he analyzed the situation.

3310
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:14,360
He analyzed the situation.

3311
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:15,500
Yeah.

3312
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:17,540
He looked at all the drop spots.

3313
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:20,160
Yeah, he made a spreadsheet and everything.

3314
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,220
How many games is this?

3315
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:24,020
Is this like six games or five games?

3316
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:25,460
Three more to get.

3317
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:26,040
Okay, six games.

3318
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,140
This plan should work.

3319
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,840
Three more to get.

3320
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,760
Oh boy.

3321
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:34,460
25 points.

3322
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:35,740
So we need eight a game.

3323
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:40,120
Wait, Jen is going...

3324
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:41,020
Harvester.

3325
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:42,020
Wait, he's going Harvester.

3326
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,080
I think that's one of the teams.

3327
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,260
Someone else is going Harvester.

3328
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:49,840
Janja and...

3329
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:51,700
Janja and who?

3330
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:54,660
Who's Jen?

3331
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:03,390
We're two Harvesters here.

3332
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:04,750
Who's the two Harvester team?

3333
01:54:05,790 --> 01:54:07,510
Oh yeah, Janja and Jen.

3334
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:10,230
Oh shit, I'm going to be like, we're landing Harvester too.

3335
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:11,870
No, no, no.

3336
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:12,690
No, no, no.

3337
01:54:12,730 --> 01:54:13,970
No, no, no.

3338
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:16,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3339
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:18,490
Okay, okay, okay.

3340
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:20,830
Wait, I need to wait for the legends.

3341
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:23,750
I need to be able to throw like a million nades at them.

3342
01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:25,090
And just run away.

3343
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:28,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3344
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:30,910
A million nades, one or two kills, and then run away.

3345
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:31,430
A million nades.

3346
01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:33,830
You're so confident in games now.

3347
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:35,290
No, you need to die.

3348
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:37,490
No, I'm going to...

3349
01:54:37,490 --> 01:54:41,390
If you die by the time we're leaving Geyser, then we can't craft you.

3350
01:54:42,430 --> 01:54:43,530
I'm going to loot No Name.

3351
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:45,690
I'll kill them and then...

3352
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:46,390
Oh wait.

3353
01:54:47,650 --> 01:54:50,130
I'll kill all of them and then just loot all of Harvester myself.

3354
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:53,170
Exactly, you go in there and just guarantee a kill.

3355
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:54,410
It doesn't matter.

3356
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:55,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3357
01:54:58,150 --> 01:54:58,870
I'm catching...

3358
01:54:59,610 --> 01:54:59,970
Fusey.

3359
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:02,690
What are they saying in the chat, bro?

3360
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:03,550
There's no Fuse.

3361
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:06,290
Pathfinder, Octane, Bloodhound, Rampart, Catalyst.

3362
01:55:06,610 --> 01:55:08,630
Alright, so obviously I'm playing...

3363
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:10,590
I guess I'll play either Globa or Newcastle.

3364
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:11,570
Which one should I do?

3365
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:14,650
I feel like we're always poor on loot.

3366
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:16,910
I feel like...

3367
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:18,230
Yeah, yeah, we definitely are.

3368
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:21,270
I feel like we have been doing really well in the loot department.

3369
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:21,810
Just saying.

3370
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:24,690
Yeah, I mean, what dickhead put us on this planet?

3371
01:55:24,690 --> 01:55:27,210
Oh wait, this is the one game that doesn't have an assault.

3372
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:28,350
No.

3373
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:29,490
It's fine, it's fine.

3374
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:30,510
It's fine, you don't need it.

3375
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:31,770
All you need to do is just kill them.

3376
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:32,410
That's really it.

3377
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:34,550
If you're dropping over there, we need the ring.

3378
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:36,290
So we're gonna have to wait for you to craft the ring.

3379
01:55:37,370 --> 01:55:39,970
I'll just kill all of them and then do the ring at Harvester.

3380
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:41,910
You're so optimistic, I hate it.

3381
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:43,070
Okay, let's do it, yeah.

3382
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,570
Okay, I'm down.

3383
01:55:44,630 --> 01:55:45,910
This is what our brain is telling us.

3384
01:55:45,950 --> 01:55:47,630
We need a rover to listen to our brain.

3385
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:49,990
Yeah, Rampart or Catalyst then.

3386
01:55:51,890 --> 01:55:52,890
Well, that's on you guys.

3387
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:54,310
I'm good with my choices.

3388
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:56,170
Who are you going for?

3389
01:55:56,330 --> 01:55:57,750
Left, and then...

3390
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:00,770
Who are you playing, Doki?

3391
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:02,730
I'm playing Loba for the loot.

3392
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:03,910
Because we're always poor.

3393
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:05,750
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna play Octane.

3394
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:06,710
We're always broke.

3395
01:56:07,070 --> 01:56:08,030
We're always broke?

3396
01:56:08,210 --> 01:56:08,790
What do you mean?

3397
01:56:09,910 --> 01:56:11,110
We're so broke all the time.

3398
01:56:11,150 --> 01:56:11,970
Alright, I'm gonna go Octane.

3399
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:14,810
This is it.

3400
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:15,250
This time.

3401
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:17,350
No, I actually think this is the one.

3402
01:56:17,390 --> 01:56:17,690
I'm not kidding.

3403
01:56:17,790 --> 01:56:18,190
No, this is the one.

3404
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:19,030
100%, dude.

3405
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:22,110
Since you're the headliner, right?

3406
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:25,610
Can you make them make up an award for us?

3407
01:56:26,250 --> 01:56:27,490
Like, the most...

3408
01:56:27,490 --> 01:56:29,190
the happiest team?

3409
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:32,970
The happiest team?

3410
01:56:33,310 --> 01:56:34,650
I feel like it would be first.

3411
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:36,230
Gotta be a little bit happier than first, right?

3412
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:38,970
Okay.

3413
01:56:39,070 --> 01:56:41,350
I'm not saying my happiness levels are down, but you know what I mean?

3414
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:43,390
The most fun team.

3415
01:56:45,130 --> 01:56:46,910
That one we take.

3416
01:56:49,990 --> 01:56:50,690
The teams with the best vibes.

3417
01:56:50,830 --> 01:56:51,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3418
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:52,110
Tell them...

3419
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:55,550
Tell the Twitch Rivals staff to pick...

3420
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:56,810
The Golden Cockies!

3421
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:57,170
Yeah!

3422
01:56:57,430 --> 01:56:58,910
They should nominate us!

3423
01:56:59,590 --> 01:57:00,790
The Golden Cockies?

3424
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:01,370
What is that?

3425
01:57:01,630 --> 01:57:03,470
What is it called?

3426
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:04,470
What is it called?

3427
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:06,110
The Golden Pants?

3428
01:57:06,370 --> 01:57:07,630
The Pants!

3429
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:08,450
What is it called?

3430
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:11,770
Cackies?

3431
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:12,390
Cackies!

3432
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:12,850
Yes!

3433
01:57:13,010 --> 01:57:13,530
Cackies!

3434
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:16,230
Is that not how you pronounce it?

3435
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:18,790
The Golden Cockies?

3436
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:22,630
They had to nominate us for the Golden Cackies!

3437
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:24,190
And then we win by sheer...

3438
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:25,310
popular vote!

3439
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:28,390
Unless Hal is in there, so obviously we're not gonna win.

3440
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:28,750
No, no, no.

3441
01:57:28,830 --> 01:57:30,190
Your VTuber army wins.

3442
01:57:30,630 --> 01:57:31,150
No, no.

3443
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:32,150
I think...

3444
01:57:32,710 --> 01:57:33,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3445
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:36,710
I don't know about that.

3446
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:37,890
I don't know about that.

3447
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:39,270
Is that time?

3448
01:57:39,590 --> 01:57:40,370
Yeah, there's time.

3449
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:42,010
Okay, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

3450
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:42,350
Okay.

3451
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:47,910
Who is everyone running... oh.

3452
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:55,700
It's okay.

3453
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:56,060
It's okay.

3454
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:57,040
They're not gonna start the game.

3455
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:00,300
They're not gonna start the game.

3456
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:01,380
They're not gonna start the game.

3457
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:02,000
We're so fine.

3458
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:03,560
Yep.

3459
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:04,700
Oh my gosh.

3460
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:05,720
Alright, alright.

3461
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:07,140
So the plan, Tempo.

3462
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:07,900
You...

3463
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:09,000
Harvester.

3464
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:10,340
You die.

3465
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:11,760
I wish I had a fuse, but...

3466
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,320
Wait, what are you playing in?

3467
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:14,980
Cat.

3468
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:21,460
But if I get a kill and I can run, I'm gonna run through NoName and then meet up with you guys to wherever you run.

3469
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,200
No one's looting NoName.

3470
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,480
Okay, but like...

3471
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:28,140
How do I land in Harvester to grief?

3472
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:29,780
Yeah, I was gonna say, how are you gonna...

3473
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:32,740
How are you gonna get to us?

3474
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:34,720
How are you gonna get to us?

3475
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:35,380
How are you gonna get to us?

3476
01:58:35,740 --> 01:58:37,860
Y'all can just punch some... oh, no, wait.

3477
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:38,420
No, I can't.

3478
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,300
You're gonna punch... don't punch someone!

3479
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:47,780
I was gonna say, punch them into the lava and then block them with Rampart...

3480
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:51,160
Punch them into the lava and then block them with Rampart walls.

3481
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:52,460
Bro, just...

3482
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,040
Don't... don't...

3483
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:02,380
Tempo, your only job.

3484
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,920
Do what you can to get a kill.

3485
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:06,100
Do not trip.

3486
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:07,780
That is your only mission.

3487
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:09,660
That's really it.

3488
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:13,460
I believe in you, Tempo.

3489
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:16,960
I can't believe our first team was our peak.

3490
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:18,680
I can get two kills.

3491
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,360
Greek isn't last with us.

3492
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:24,340
Wait, we're last, too?

3493
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:25,120
Wait, that's...

3494
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,160
No, that's good, though.

3495
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:27,500
That's good.

3496
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:30,020
Wait, the score... wait, Greek?

3497
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,000
Wait...

3498
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:34,180
Who's Greek on...

3499
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:35,480
Wait, we have five points.

3500
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:36,320
Yes!

3501
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,000
So he's guaranteed last.

3502
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,140
Oh, my God, it's the best M.O.I.

3503
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:41,920
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

3504
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:43,060
Wait, who's Greek with?

3505
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:43,760
Timmy?

3506
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:44,260
Reptar.

3507
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,320
Reptar and...

3508
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:46,900
Didn't Reptar pick first?

3509
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:47,940
Yeah.

3510
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:53,920
Doki just exploded.

3511
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:55,400
Doki just exploded.

3512
01:59:56,540 --> 01:59:59,420
Wait, what about landing tunnel that's close to the balloon?

3513
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,260
What's the tunnel that's close to the balloon?

3514
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:03,620
In Harvester.

3515
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:05,760
Are you picked first, though?

3516
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:09,360
It's the curse.

3517
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,260
It's the curse.

3518
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:13,800
I can feel the curse.

3519
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:14,860
There's a tunnel?

3520
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:17,900
Oh, it started.

3521
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:19,440
You guys have your picks?

3522
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,000
I have my pick.

3523
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:22,640
Wig?

3524
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,920
I bet you Wig ran into Greek.

3525
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:28,480
Wig, we can't have minus five.

3526
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,180
We only have five points.

3527
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:31,540
Who am I playing?

3528
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:33,180
I thought you were playing Octane.

3529
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,340
Yeah, I'm playing Loba.

3530
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:36,820
Yeah, I got cat.

3531
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:41,520
I was gonna say, we literally only have five points.

3532
02:00:41,540 --> 02:00:43,100
We can't have a minus five.

3533
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,040
I was gonna say, we literally only have five points.

3534
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:47,160
I mean, even if we got ten points here, we're still bottom five.

3535
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:48,580
Wait, what?

3536
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:50,900
Where are you seeing the scores?

3537
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,920
The Google Sheet thing isn't updated.

3538
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:53,980
I'm just guessing.

3539
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:55,460
Bro, what?

3540
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:58,700
Bro, what happened to us?

3541
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,300
We fell off, man.

3542
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:03,560
What do you mean?

3543
02:01:03,620 --> 02:01:04,480
We did so well.

3544
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:07,660
We did so well last Rivals.

3545
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:08,660
What happened to us?

3546
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:11,660
Watch this redemption round.

3547
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:12,580
Temple's gonna kill it right here.

3548
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:15,260
Just remember to solo.

3549
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:19,740
Wait, is that the thingy?

3550
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:20,040
Wait, is that the thingy?

3551
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:20,300
Oh, it is.

3552
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,680
No minus five.

3553
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:22,580
Jesus Christ.

3554
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:24,320
There's the zero points.

3555
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:25,520
Holy fuck, dude.

3556
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:28,020
Oh my god.

3557
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:29,120
Goodbye, Temple.

3558
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:30,260
Goodbye.

3559
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:33,920
Pathfinder's choice chat.

3560
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:34,220
We're good.

3561
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:37,720
Yo, they see one random person just flying.

3562
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,600
Yo, there's a contest here.

3563
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,340
Yo, they see one random person just flying.

3564
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:41,740
Yo, there's a contest here.

3565
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:43,000
Oh my god, they're landing on each other.

3566
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:45,140
I'm gonna go left here.

3567
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:46,880
They're landing on each other.

3568
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:48,500
Temple, I am waiting for that.

3569
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:53,480
There's no fucking scans on us anyway, so we're fine.

3570
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:53,920
There's no fucking scans on us anyway, so we're fine.

3571
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:55,060
Wait, what?

3572
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:56,440
No, I'm okay.

3573
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:56,680
I'm alive.

3574
02:01:57,900 --> 02:01:59,600
There's someone landing inside the no-name.

3575
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:00,840
Okay, okay.

3576
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,220
You scared the shit out of me there.

3577
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:03,420
That scared the shit out of me too.

3578
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,320
Wait, they're not fighting?

3579
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:06,660
They're not fighting?

3580
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:08,280
How about you need to die?

3581
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:09,900
You guys have beacon over there?

3582
02:02:10,180 --> 02:02:11,380
No, of course not.

3583
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:13,300
No, we need you to die, brother.

3584
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:16,840
We were solely dependent on you dying here.

3585
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:16,960
We were solely dependent on you dying here.

3586
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:17,900
Yo, I got his beacon.

3587
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:19,100
I'm running back to you.

3588
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:19,800
You got his beacon?

3589
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,900
I'm stealing their loot and I'm running with their beacon.

3590
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:23,800
I thought they were contesting.

3591
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:24,320
What happened?

3592
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:24,980
They are.

3593
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:26,180
They're contesting very far away.

3594
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:27,480
Oh, okay.

3595
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:29,280
Very far away.

3596
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:30,500
It's okay.

3597
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:31,510
I got a beacon.

3598
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:32,920
It's okay.

3599
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:33,480
I got a beacon.

3600
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:34,780
We can get a god spawn here, guys.

3601
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:35,620
Oh, we're zoned?

3602
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:35,900
We're zoned?

3603
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:37,440
Yeah, we have zoned.

3604
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:37,940
We have zoned on us.

3605
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:38,560
How do you know?

3606
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:39,520
I'm running.

3607
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:39,940
I'm running.

3608
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:41,140
Look at the zone.

3609
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:41,540
Look at the zone.

3610
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:42,740
It's going to pull up towards Overlook side.

3611
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:43,480
We got a scan?

3612
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:46,320
Now they're going to think we're a duo.

3613
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:47,540
Oh, no.

3614
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:49,760
They're actually going to run up on us.

3615
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:51,580
Oh, my God.

3616
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:52,120
They're going to send us.

3617
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,080
I will bet my entire life they'll send us.

3618
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:57,460
Our whole plan was for Tempo to die, but yet he's still alive.

3619
02:02:58,040 --> 02:02:58,980
I'm still fucking alive, man.

3620
02:02:58,980 --> 02:03:02,880
I left this house for you except for the helmet.

3621
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:03,120
It's fine.

3622
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:05,280
I'm more focused on these guys actually coming to kill us.

3623
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:06,560
I'm more focused on these guys actually coming to kill us.

3624
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:07,500
In the end...

3625
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,680
In the end, what if Tempo is the one that crafts us in the end?

3626
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:13,380
That would actually be so...

3627
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:14,220
That would actually be poetic.

3628
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:17,720
That would be so sad.

3629
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:20,060
That would be so sad.

3630
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:21,040
That would be so sad.

3631
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:22,100
I got a W.

3632
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:26,160
Oh, I have a Havoc Turbo.

3633
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:26,620
Now we won.

3634
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:27,080
Oh, I have a Havoc Turbo.

3635
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:27,080
Now we won.

3636
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:30,140
I have a R9 Bolt.

3637
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:31,860
I'm only short range.

3638
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:34,100
I'm going to craft a...

3639
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:35,720
Alright, Tempo, are you okay?

3640
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,000
I'm going to craft a bat.

3641
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:38,240
You're going to eat.

3642
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:38,680
I'm going to eat.

3643
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,640
Okay, I'm going to craft a bat, then.

3644
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:42,900
I'm making sure I'm not getting sent down.

3645
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:43,560
We're okay right now.

3646
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:44,280
We're good.

3647
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:46,640
Alright, we need to get this down, Tempo.

3648
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:47,840
So get over here quick, and we're going to go.

3649
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:49,080
Yeah, I'm here now.

3650
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:50,700
We're going to get inside Overlook somewhere.

3651
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,180
I just don't know where this zone is exactly ending.

3652
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:54,460
That's my evac.

3653
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:01,560
I have an increased range for my ult.

3654
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:03,280
I can ult whenever, but I'll wait a little bit.

3655
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:04,440
I'm evac-ing to you.

3656
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,520
Are we staying here?

3657
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:11,940
No, we're going, we're going.

3658
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:13,220
Okay, I'm coming over here.

3659
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:14,620
Up towards Overlook, for sure.

3660
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:15,540
That's where it's gonna end.

3661
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:21,000
Any of that fucking shit up top, any of those houses up top, bro, we are vibing.

3662
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:21,860
Like, we're actually chilling.

3663
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:26,420
We can get routed on here pretty hard, so we gotta watch out, we have no scans.

3664
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,180
And teams are gonna have Bloodhound.

3665
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:31,840
So let me go first, and whatever happens, just run away and craft me.

3666
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,440
Alright, I'm giving you the lead here.

3667
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:38,740
I'm not kidding, at any moment, if you think we're losing this gunfight, you guys won.

3668
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:41,180
What if that's every moment?

3669
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:43,400
Who looted inside here?

3670
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:44,800
I did, I did, I did.

3671
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:47,140
I have an extra battle style, you guys are far.

3672
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:51,900
Okay, I was gonna say, I can loot the vault right now.

3673
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:53,980
Oh, loot the vault, loot the vault, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3674
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:55,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna loot the vault.

3675
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:56,540
Yeah, do it, do it, do it.

3676
02:04:57,200 --> 02:04:58,460
I'm watching this thingy.

3677
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:00,040
I need to close my blinds, I actually can't see.

3678
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:01,820
Yeah, I was gonna say, where the fuck did you go?

3679
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,580
We're good, we're good, we're good.

3680
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:04,520
Alright.

3681
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,760
Let's see, I'm gonna grab...

3682
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:09,640
I'm gonna grab the knockback shield, yeah.

3683
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:12,300
Knockback shield, never heard of that, let's do it.

3684
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:15,540
Knockdown, knockdown.

3685
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:20,200
I got the knockdown shield, guys.

3686
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:21,660
If you guys get down, I have gold.

3687
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:24,080
If you get knocked, just get back up.

3688
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:26,400
Yeah, it's a knockback.

3689
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:27,940
Yup, yup, yup.

3690
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,120
Alright, keep on moving, keep on moving, we're good.

3691
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:31,020
I'm right behind you.

3692
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:32,840
We're doing great, guys, seriously.

3693
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:34,080
Not last, 19th place.

3694
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,280
Each placement is an improvement.

3695
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:40,460
Wait, wait, don't come over here, wait, wait.

3696
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:42,180
Okay, okay, come, come, come, we're good.

3697
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:43,220
Okay.

3698
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:46,340
I'm putting all my trust in you.

3699
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:48,460
I shouldn't, but like...

3700
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:49,440
Don't do that, please.

3701
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:51,920
Don't worry, I'm gonna give you more pressure.

3702
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:54,500
Give me comms real quick, one sec.

3703
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,340
Can't tell if there's someone here or not.

3704
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:00,040
I cannot, dude.

3705
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:01,100
I don't think so, I don't think so.

3706
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:02,280
I'm gonna go on high, I'm gonna go on high.

3707
02:06:02,700 --> 02:06:03,600
Okay, I got scanned.

3708
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:04,840
Yeah, we're good.

3709
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:05,940
I'm gonna hit beacon here, too.

3710
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:07,280
We're gonna play back here and hit the beacon late, okay?

3711
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:07,660
Okay.

3712
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:10,200
I'm always right here.

3713
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:11,480
Tempo, you have anything you shoot this guy with?

3714
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:13,820
Yeah, can we climb up there?

3715
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:14,620
No, we can't.

3716
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:16,140
We can, like, be on the ledge here.

3717
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,600
I think I can give you guys a zipline, though, if you need it.

3718
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:18,680
Yeah, we need a zipline here.

3719
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:19,980
You guys can get over here to zipline.

3720
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:21,340
I wanna put it down below, like...

3721
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:22,240
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're here.

3722
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:24,700
Yeah, come over, I'll have 20% on it.

3723
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:25,280
Just stay up here for now.

3724
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:28,300
Did you put cat cues over here, Tempo, at all?

3725
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:29,540
Uh, yeah.

3726
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:30,600
I threw one up over there.

3727
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:32,000
Yeah, we're gonna do that for right now.

3728
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:32,460
Okay.

3729
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:35,220
This is rampart, so teams are definitely gonna think it's enemy here, for sure.

3730
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:35,720
Okay.

3731
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:40,900
I have only short range.

3732
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:43,080
Okay, I have long range, I'm good.

3733
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:43,760
I have flat.

3734
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:46,480
I ping the longbow and stuff.

3735
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:47,660
Yeah.

3736
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:48,540
Good.

3737
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:49,540
I already have one, I'm sure.

3738
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:51,240
Yeah, yeah, but for tempo, I meant.

3739
02:06:51,620 --> 02:06:52,840
Let me check if there's any sniper.

3740
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:54,340
Oh, there's sniper ammo here if you need it.

3741
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:56,240
Oh, I might be able to...

3742
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:56,760
I'll take afterwards, yeah.

3743
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:58,580
I'm just gonna play on this side to make sure no one pushes us.

3744
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:04,480
Are you fucking poking them with a fucking...

3745
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:06,800
One sec.

3746
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:08,180
I'll do this for you guys.

3747
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:08,540
One sec.

3748
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:09,220
You guys stay there, okay?

3749
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:09,520
Okay.

3750
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:12,020
I'm gonna do this for y'all, just in case you wanna come up here.

3751
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:12,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3752
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:14,000
I wanna be free.

3753
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:15,480
And I'll play the other side, though.

3754
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:16,360
You can go from there.

3755
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:17,240
I'll be here.

3756
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:18,620
Yeah, you're good.

3757
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:18,800
Nice.

3758
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:19,520
They're fighting over here.

3759
02:07:19,580 --> 02:07:19,940
They're fighting.

3760
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:21,180
How hard?

3761
02:07:21,220 --> 02:07:21,500
How hard?

3762
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:22,320
Hard fighting.

3763
02:07:22,340 --> 02:07:23,260
They just inted each other.

3764
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:24,420
They kill each other?

3765
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:26,720
They kill each other, yeah.

3766
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,680
I don't think there was a way for us to get there.

3767
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:29,480
Yeah.

3768
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:30,780
Yeah.

3769
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:35,400
I'm gonna put a low ball right here, so see if there's a sniper.

3770
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:37,360
Go for it.

3771
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:38,560
I'm gonna hit the beacon when it's closest.

3772
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:39,740
I have my zone thing now.

3773
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:40,440
All right.

3774
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:40,980
So we're good to go.

3775
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:42,240
Pew.

3776
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:44,880
Oh, there's snipers for you.

3777
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:45,240
There's snipers.

3778
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:46,700
154.

3779
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:47,360
154.

3780
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:48,320
Okay.

3781
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:51,120
And there's sniper scopes.

3782
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:51,760
There's sniper scopes.

3783
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:53,840
You can do this.

3784
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:54,880
I hit the...

3785
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,640
I did my upgrade.

3786
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:55,980
I'm on perk.

3787
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:56,240
Someone...

3788
02:07:56,240 --> 02:07:58,160
Someone get the stuff before it's gone.

3789
02:07:58,160 --> 02:07:58,420
I'm going now.

3790
02:07:58,440 --> 02:07:58,780
I'm going now.

3791
02:07:58,860 --> 02:08:00,020
Before someone shoots it.

3792
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:00,560
Look at the zone.

3793
02:08:00,620 --> 02:08:00,880
Look at the zone.

3794
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:01,840
We need to move up.

3795
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:02,240
We need to move up.

3796
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:02,680
Okay.

3797
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:07,990
All right.

3798
02:08:08,050 --> 02:08:09,110
We need to take more space in zone.

3799
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:10,130
We have a good...

3800
02:08:10,130 --> 02:08:11,130
We need to get this house right here, okay?

3801
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:12,110
All right.

3802
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:13,870
I'm heading over to you.

3803
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:14,930
Yeah, you're good.

3804
02:08:14,970 --> 02:08:15,910
We get in here, we're vibing.

3805
02:08:16,770 --> 02:08:17,490
Make sure we...

3806
02:08:17,490 --> 02:08:17,730
Okay.

3807
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:20,010
Now, when we're in this house, we 100% can get sent on.

3808
02:08:20,090 --> 02:08:20,590
Just play slow.

3809
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:21,130
All right.

3810
02:08:21,590 --> 02:08:23,170
My Q takes someone behind us.

3811
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:24,050
Yeah, there's people behind me.

3812
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:24,630
There's people behind me.

3813
02:08:24,690 --> 02:08:25,490
Can you cover me?

3814
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:26,270
Yeah, you're good.

3815
02:08:26,270 --> 02:08:26,630
I'm looking for you.

3816
02:08:26,690 --> 02:08:26,970
I'm looking for you.

3817
02:08:27,010 --> 02:08:27,230
We're vibing.

3818
02:08:27,950 --> 02:08:29,250
That's all right, I don't wanna dive through the window.

3819
02:08:30,770 --> 02:08:31,190
I'm here.

3820
02:08:32,450 --> 02:08:32,810
You're good.

3821
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:33,090
You're good.

3822
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:33,330
You're good.

3823
02:08:33,330 --> 02:08:33,510
You're good.

3824
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:34,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3825
02:08:34,910 --> 02:08:35,530
We're vibing.

3826
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:35,950
We're vibing.

3827
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:36,110
We're vibing.

3828
02:08:36,110 --> 02:08:36,550
I'm vibing.

3829
02:08:36,590 --> 02:08:36,990
I'm vibing.

3830
02:08:37,050 --> 02:08:40,190
I could have Q'd, but I didn't because I had more confidence in you guys as a team.

3831
02:08:41,710 --> 02:08:42,270
Thank you.

3832
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:44,770
We're good.

3833
02:08:45,590 --> 02:08:50,070
Had a lot of confidence in all of you to protect me so I never Q'd.

3834
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:52,850
I would definitely Q.

3835
02:08:53,030 --> 02:08:53,850
Me and Tebow are not good.

3836
02:08:55,070 --> 02:08:56,970
That means I trust my homies.

3837
02:08:57,130 --> 02:08:57,730
Get your homies.

3838
02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:58,090
Thank you so much.

3839
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:00,190
My life is in your hands.

3840
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:01,430
That's too much.

3841
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,610
No pressure.

3842
02:09:05,450 --> 02:09:06,890
I don't even know where I got shot at.

3843
02:09:07,130 --> 02:09:08,070
We can get farmer guys here.

3844
02:09:08,070 --> 02:09:08,430
Oh, right here.

3845
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:09,150
On Crafter.

3846
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:09,570
Okay.

3847
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:11,430
But the zone's actually not bad for us.

3848
02:09:11,470 --> 02:09:12,050
We're fine right now.

3849
02:09:12,170 --> 02:09:12,790
We're doing pretty good.

3850
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:14,370
Is anyone in Big House over here at Tempo?

3851
02:09:14,810 --> 02:09:15,230
Do you know?

3852
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:16,810
I'm gonna check.

3853
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:17,390
You guys stay there.

3854
02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:18,050
Whoa.

3855
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:19,150
Now I see it.

3856
02:09:19,390 --> 02:09:20,770
Now I know what you guys are talking about.

3857
02:09:20,970 --> 02:09:21,410
No one's in here.

3858
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:23,150
I mean, they might be routing it, but I think they sent it.

3859
02:09:23,150 --> 02:09:23,770
I'm gonna go in here once.

3860
02:09:23,770 --> 02:09:24,150
I just wait.

3861
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:24,370
Okay.

3862
02:09:24,630 --> 02:09:25,950
We can't craft you if you die.

3863
02:09:26,530 --> 02:09:26,950
I know.

3864
02:09:27,030 --> 02:09:27,230
You're good.

3865
02:09:30,030 --> 02:09:30,650
There's no one in here.

3866
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:31,010
Come with me.

3867
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:31,270
Come with me.

3868
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:31,510
Come with me.

3869
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:31,870
Come with me.

3870
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:32,230
Okay.

3871
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:34,270
Actually, you might need to node that, Tempo.

3872
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:34,550
Yeah.

3873
02:09:34,650 --> 02:09:36,070
Node what?

3874
02:09:37,190 --> 02:09:37,870
Just scan me.

3875
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:39,550
Woo.

3876
02:09:40,250 --> 02:09:40,810
Am I...

3877
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:41,270
It's that...

3878
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:43,990
Oh, it's...

3879
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:45,030
I'm dead.

3880
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:45,370
I'm dead.

3881
02:09:45,610 --> 02:09:47,690
I'm dead!

3882
02:09:49,550 --> 02:09:50,570
How did she do this?

3883
02:09:50,570 --> 02:09:51,310
Not a camera for you, Tempo.

3884
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:52,710
How did she?

3885
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:55,510
I'm good.

3886
02:09:55,650 --> 02:09:56,230
I'm okay.

3887
02:09:56,730 --> 02:09:58,470
How does she fucking do it?

3888
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:00,030
I'm losing so many cells.

3889
02:10:00,150 --> 02:10:00,430
It's crazy.

3890
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:01,230
I'm just gonna not peek anymore.

3891
02:10:01,370 --> 02:10:01,590
I'm good.

3892
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:03,190
We're good, guys.

3893
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:03,930
I'm good.

3894
02:10:03,990 --> 02:10:04,510
We're all good.

3895
02:10:04,590 --> 02:10:06,510
I don't know how the fuck we did it in here, but we did it, guys.

3896
02:10:06,510 --> 02:10:08,870
I don't know how I lived that, but let's go.

3897
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:10,770
Joe, I'm very proud of you.

3898
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:11,370
Good shit, guys.

3899
02:10:11,930 --> 02:10:12,250
Okay.

3900
02:10:12,570 --> 02:10:13,050
Are you getting sent on?

3901
02:10:13,150 --> 02:10:13,790
Are you teaming with us now?

3902
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:15,070
Underneath our house.

3903
02:10:15,270 --> 02:10:16,010
Underneath us, which is fine.

3904
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:16,430
Okay.

3905
02:10:16,990 --> 02:10:18,790
I put a Loba stick on the door.

3906
02:10:19,890 --> 02:10:21,870
They're shooting my stick, but that's okay.

3907
02:10:21,870 --> 02:10:23,670
I grabbed some stuff before they could.

3908
02:10:24,830 --> 02:10:26,830
If you guys want more ammo, there's some here.

3909
02:10:26,950 --> 02:10:27,430
I'm just gonna...

3910
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:29,430
Teemu, we don't have enough meds.

3911
02:10:29,490 --> 02:10:30,170
Don't peek too much.

3912
02:10:33,270 --> 02:10:34,710
You guys can grab ammo here.

3913
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:36,550
Oh, there's 39 cells.

3914
02:10:36,810 --> 02:10:37,370
Oh my god.

3915
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:38,110
I'm chillin' out.

3916
02:10:38,170 --> 02:10:39,250
Oh, I should've picked cells.

3917
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:40,150
I'm so stupid.

3918
02:10:40,390 --> 02:10:41,090
Okay, we'll do the next one.

3919
02:10:41,190 --> 02:10:41,350
We're good.

3920
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:42,270
Oh yeah, that's right.

3921
02:10:43,570 --> 02:10:44,230
Are you ready?

3922
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:45,290
Teemu, you wanna pick?

3923
02:10:45,330 --> 02:10:47,150
You wanna do the thing?

3924
02:10:47,730 --> 02:10:48,430
Yeah, one sec.

3925
02:10:48,570 --> 02:10:49,730
I'm gonna heal up.

3926
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:54,150
39... 33 cells is gigantic for us, guys.

3927
02:10:54,210 --> 02:10:54,910
Yeah, that's so nice.

3928
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:56,950
Good fucking call on the Loba, dude.

3929
02:10:57,090 --> 02:10:57,690
I told you!

3930
02:10:57,970 --> 02:10:59,930
I know because we're always poor!

3931
02:11:00,270 --> 02:11:01,070
Every game!

3932
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:06,330
We have to play Loba to have anything in life.

3933
02:11:07,390 --> 02:11:07,750
Wig.

3934
02:11:08,410 --> 02:11:08,830
What's up?

3935
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:11,650
Ooh, I'll take that if you don't need it.

3936
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:13,590
Yeah, I grabbed the charge rifle.

3937
02:11:13,790 --> 02:11:15,150
I'll put the next one here.

3938
02:11:15,170 --> 02:11:16,030
You need a sniper ammo, buddy?

3939
02:11:16,150 --> 02:11:16,790
I can give you something if you need.

3940
02:11:16,850 --> 02:11:17,170
I got it.

3941
02:11:17,190 --> 02:11:18,750
I picked it all from the thing.

3942
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:19,550
Alright, big dog.

3943
02:11:19,570 --> 02:11:20,090
Let me know if you need more.

3944
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:21,150
It's loot time.

3945
02:11:21,870 --> 02:11:22,410
Loot time.

3946
02:11:23,710 --> 02:11:26,910
My existence is to just sit here because I don't have any range.

3947
02:11:27,850 --> 02:11:28,410
Yeah, you're good.

3948
02:11:28,470 --> 02:11:29,490
Just the team underneath us.

3949
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:30,530
Make sure we just don't get walked up on.

3950
02:11:30,570 --> 02:11:30,850
Yeah.

3951
02:11:31,870 --> 02:11:33,450
I'll aim up this window at them.

3952
02:11:33,550 --> 02:11:33,850
Wait.

3953
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:34,890
They're on our roof now.

3954
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:36,330
I think they're on our... Oh, they're on our roof.

3955
02:11:36,370 --> 02:11:40,230
Okay, I was gonna say, I feel like they might rampart our door.

3956
02:11:43,210 --> 02:11:44,830
Honestly, them being on the roof is pretty good for us.

3957
02:11:44,910 --> 02:11:48,610
Yeah, they're like our wall.

3958
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:51,630
How is this guy walking up if there's a team on our roof?

3959
02:11:52,450 --> 02:11:53,090
They're breaching...

3960
02:11:53,090 --> 02:11:55,530
As I say, they're not gonna push us and this team just literally sits there for free.

3961
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:55,970
It's crazy.

3962
02:11:57,150 --> 02:11:58,150
They have their priorities.

3963
02:11:58,810 --> 02:11:59,830
Oh yeah, we're locked in.

3964
02:11:59,910 --> 02:12:00,690
We're so good, guys.

3965
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:02,250
We got good spots.

3966
02:12:03,070 --> 02:12:03,810
Look at us.

3967
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:04,250
Yeah, we're killing it.

3968
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:05,290
We're fucking killing it.

3969
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:08,150
We just need a team to die around us.

3970
02:12:09,030 --> 02:12:09,730
That's what I'm saying.

3971
02:12:09,890 --> 02:12:11,110
And we're gonna get so much loot.

3972
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:12,490
We should be good for next zone.

3973
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:14,010
I'm pretty sure the next zone's gonna pull towards us.

3974
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:14,710
Yeah, me too.

3975
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:15,930
I think.

3976
02:12:16,030 --> 02:12:16,490
I could be wrong.

3977
02:12:17,110 --> 02:12:18,210
I'm just gonna believe in you.

3978
02:12:18,990 --> 02:12:19,430
Thank you.

3979
02:12:19,590 --> 02:12:20,710
That's actually the nicest thing you're saying.

3980
02:12:22,190 --> 02:12:23,970
I've always believed in you.

3981
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:25,170
Thank you so much.

3982
02:12:25,450 --> 02:12:29,950
Like, why is YBNCC with you for seven... maybe hypothetically seven hours?

3983
02:12:30,190 --> 02:12:31,390
Isn't this guy just out in the open?

3984
02:12:31,410 --> 02:12:32,150
Three and a half hours.

3985
02:12:32,970 --> 02:12:33,330
Probably.

3986
02:12:33,430 --> 02:12:34,470
He's just out in the open shooting.

3987
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:35,990
I don't know how he's doing that with a team on our roof.

3988
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:36,730
Isn't there a team on our roof?

3989
02:12:36,970 --> 02:12:37,910
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3990
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:38,190
I'm confused.

3991
02:12:38,330 --> 02:12:39,250
They're not looking at him.

3992
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:42,110
That's how.

3993
02:12:42,110 --> 02:12:43,490
They might push us if they knock us, to be honest.

3994
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:45,050
100%, yeah.

3995
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:47,310
Okay, I'm gonna go put...

3996
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:47,430
I'm a little horny.

3997
02:12:49,590 --> 02:12:49,950
Yeah.

3998
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:52,250
How is this team on the roof not shooting these guys?

3999
02:12:52,830 --> 02:12:54,390
And what's this, the third on our roof?

4000
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:59,670
I'm gonna grab this armor and then also these shields.

4001
02:13:00,530 --> 02:13:01,730
Oh my god, bro.

4002
02:13:02,270 --> 02:13:03,970
The cells are such a vibe.

4003
02:13:04,150 --> 02:13:05,050
The cells are such a vibe.

4004
02:13:05,050 --> 02:13:05,190
Yeah.

4005
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:05,430
It's unreal.

4006
02:13:05,830 --> 02:13:06,890
Such a vibe saver.

4007
02:13:06,930 --> 02:13:07,270
It's crazy.

4008
02:13:07,530 --> 02:13:07,990
Good shot.

4009
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:09,330
Let us go.

4010
02:13:10,110 --> 02:13:13,430
They can't kill us because we always have unlimited cells.

4011
02:13:14,030 --> 02:13:16,450
This has to be his teammate that's on our roof.

4012
02:13:16,610 --> 02:13:18,750
There's no way these guys are able to peek this without getting shot.

4013
02:13:18,750 --> 02:13:19,390
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

4014
02:13:19,390 --> 02:13:19,730
Yeah.

4015
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:23,830
I mean, this guy is just in the open, in the open.

4016
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:24,390
This is crazy.

4017
02:13:27,450 --> 02:13:28,210
If anyone was...

4018
02:13:28,210 --> 02:13:29,550
Who the hell would run Newcastle in this lobby?

4019
02:13:30,370 --> 02:13:31,710
Someone with a lot of...

4020
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:34,190
Someone that's not Geyser for POI.

4021
02:13:34,290 --> 02:13:36,210
And someone that's very confident in their ability.

4022
02:13:36,430 --> 02:13:36,870
Yeah.

4023
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:41,390
Oh, they took this.

4024
02:13:42,270 --> 02:13:43,070
1, 2, 1, RV.

4025
02:13:43,330 --> 02:13:43,930
Oh, nice.

4026
02:13:44,030 --> 02:13:44,530
Oh my god, he's flesh.

4027
02:13:46,430 --> 02:13:47,530
That team should die.

4028
02:13:48,290 --> 02:13:49,370
There's no way someone's gonna die.

4029
02:13:49,370 --> 02:13:49,910
Don't you let them do that.

4030
02:13:50,170 --> 02:13:51,990
Well, I think they're doing it right now.

4031
02:13:52,270 --> 02:13:53,050
They are doing it.

4032
02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:53,310
They're good.

4033
02:13:53,410 --> 02:13:53,730
They're chilling.

4034
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:56,090
Guys, guys, guys.

4035
02:13:56,110 --> 02:13:56,470
Soon.

4036
02:13:57,850 --> 02:13:58,570
Holy shit.

4037
02:13:59,570 --> 02:14:01,230
Listen, we gotta hold it down here, guys.

4038
02:14:01,250 --> 02:14:01,910
We gotta hold it down.

4039
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:02,350
I've never been top 10 before.

4040
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:03,430
I'm the...

4041
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:06,230
Don't jinx it.

4042
02:14:06,410 --> 02:14:10,970
Genuinely, genuinely, if we get sent on and people are trying to push in our building, we do not contest.

4043
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:13,010
We back up here and throw grenades here, okay?

4044
02:14:13,110 --> 02:14:13,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4045
02:14:14,170 --> 02:14:15,150
I'm being so serious.

4046
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:16,110
Yeah, I'm being so serious.

4047
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:16,670
Yeah, I'm being so serious.

4048
02:14:19,390 --> 02:14:20,610
I'm so for real right now.

4049
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:21,270
I'm not even trying to be funny.

4050
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:23,590
I opened their door.

4051
02:14:25,450 --> 02:14:26,350
Wait, wait, wait.

4052
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:27,830
Oh, they might be...

4053
02:14:27,830 --> 02:14:28,290
Oh, wait.

4054
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:29,050
Does the real...

4055
02:14:29,050 --> 02:14:30,950
Does Sheila break through cat door or no?

4056
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:31,230
Yes.

4057
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:31,950
Yes.

4058
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:32,370
Yes.

4059
02:14:32,370 --> 02:14:32,750
They can.

4060
02:14:32,830 --> 02:14:32,930
Really?

4061
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,970
It does.

4062
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:34,570
It can.

4063
02:14:34,790 --> 02:14:36,070
That's why I was like, be careful of this door.

4064
02:14:36,150 --> 02:14:36,450
Be careful.

4065
02:14:36,710 --> 02:14:38,570
I heard the wide up and I'm scared now.

4066
02:14:38,690 --> 02:14:39,910
I heard the wide up.

4067
02:14:42,350 --> 02:14:44,410
The wide up is giving me fear.

4068
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:46,610
I'm scared.

4069
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:54,160
It is?

4070
02:14:58,320 --> 02:14:59,080
Oh, the big air sólo.

4071
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:02,740
I don't need air.

4072
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:04,460
This is...

4073
02:15:04,460 --> 02:15:04,540
This is just...

4074
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:05,660
It's just high, but I suddenly got out of control and

4075
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:08,920
I was scared again.

4076
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:08,940
Yeah.

4077
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,440
Oh, this is insane.

4078
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:11,500
You just became the Hippoc tops, all this stuff.

4079
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:12,320
By now we're all chiefs, I think, and we've got nearly the same points.

4080
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,820
We wanna talk to chat��릴ikto.

4081
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:15,880
Okay.

4082
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:16,760
Amazing.

4083
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:17,420
We didn't target the...

4084
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:17,460
Serious.

4085
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:18,580
If we didn't...

4086
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:20,260
Sendon is like literally just walk back and forth.

4087
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,840
I have another low ball.

4088
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:24,200
Oh, nice.

4089
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:24,600
Nice.

4090
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:25,780
That's great.

4091
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:26,900
More people are going to die near us too.

4092
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:27,300
This is fantastic.

4093
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:30,320
I might actually just take grenades.

4094
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:33,040
There's a lot for her.

4095
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:34,900
I took two grenades.

4096
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:35,580
I'm just going to put them on the ground.

4097
02:15:36,820 --> 02:15:37,460
If we need them.

4098
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:38,900
Me too.

4099
02:15:38,980 --> 02:15:39,320
Me too.

4100
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:41,040
We're definitely not going to need anything else.

4101
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:41,640
We should be fine.

4102
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:44,600
You guys are just picking up the grenades that you threw down.

4103
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:44,740
Yeah.

4104
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:47,860
Why did we pick up the grenades we dropped?

4105
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:50,520
I'm sick to my stomach, dude.

4106
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:52,520
Fuck me, man.

4107
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,100
Okay, that's pretty funny.

4108
02:15:58,920 --> 02:15:59,560
It's a Sheila.

4109
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:00,660
Take the door.

4110
02:16:00,740 --> 02:16:01,160
Take the door.

4111
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:03,300
Okay.

4112
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:05,820
Okay.

4113
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:11,140
I'm going to collapse this.

4114
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:12,520
I'm going to look for picks here on the back side.

4115
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:16,440
I'm looking with you, just in case.

4116
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,520
Yeah, we're vibing.

4117
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:18,860
Top 12, guys.

4118
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:20,320
Zone, are we in?

4119
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:21,000
Alright, guys.

4120
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:21,480
Don't...

4121
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:22,560
We're in.

4122
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:23,220
We're in this corner.

4123
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:25,160
We're playing that corner.

4124
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:25,820
We're playing that corner.

4125
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:28,060
We walk out late.

4126
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:30,180
We're going to show no presence once the zone closes.

4127
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:32,820
The only way they know we're here is from our low ball.

4128
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:33,460
That's fine.

4129
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:35,860
I need to get fucking purple, bro, for a zipline really bad.

4130
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:40,540
We got to get purple here.

4131
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:42,300
There's people.

4132
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:42,820
There's a guy.

4133
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:44,020
There's a Newcastle behind this wall.

4134
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:45,940
Alright, we got scanned from below.

4135
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:46,060
Come on.

4136
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:49,640
There's a Newcastle right here behind this.

4137
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:51,360
He's just...

4138
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:52,220
I need to get purple.

4139
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,840
Oh, he's rotating to the left.

4140
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:57,540
Oh, I couldn't see him in time.

4141
02:16:58,580 --> 02:16:59,480
It's a little rat.

4142
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:00,520
He's a little rat guy.

4143
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:02,320
It's a little rat guy?

4144
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:03,360
Yeah, he's a little rat.

4145
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:04,520
He's ratting up there.

4146
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,680
I have low ball in 20.

4147
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:12,440
We're good.

4148
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:12,700
We're good.

4149
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:13,440
We're doing great.

4150
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:18,420
We're doing great, guys.

4151
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:21,440
I need my zipline here so we take less damage on zip.

4152
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:21,620
I need my zipline here so we take less damage on zip.

4153
02:17:21,620 --> 02:17:21,880
Really bad.

4154
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:22,660
I need to get this purple.

4155
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:25,220
Fuck me.

4156
02:17:25,300 --> 02:17:25,760
I missed the shot.

4157
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:29,480
I need my zipline here so we take less damage on zip.

4158
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:29,660
Oh my god.

4159
02:17:29,680 --> 02:17:30,200
Let's fucking go.

4160
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:30,720
Holy shit.

4161
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:31,000
Oh my god.

4162
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Let's fucking go.

4163
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Holy shit.

4164
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:31,020
Oh my god.

4165
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:34,560
I want to shoot this guy so bad.

4166
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:37,780
I have low ball in 10.

4167
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:38,940
Yeah, we're good.

4168
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:39,140
We're good.

4169
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:39,580
Just keep holding.

4170
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,280
Literally make sure that no one pushes this door.

4171
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:42,140
That's all we need right now.

4172
02:17:42,140 --> 02:17:43,960
Just make sure we don't get shielded in the back late.

4173
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:45,140
Yeah, I'm looking.

4174
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:45,780
I'm looking for you guys.

4175
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:46,640
We're good.

4176
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:47,780
I'm going to keep staring here too.

4177
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:48,040
One sec.

4178
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:48,960
I'm going to keep looking in the back.

4179
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:49,460
You guys look cool.

4180
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:50,520
I'm looking in the store just in case.

4181
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:51,140
Yeah, you guys look cool.

4182
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:52,560
I have ult here.

4183
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,560
I'm going to put my ult right here.

4184
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:54,720
I regret the decision fully.

4185
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:55,280
That guy's a beast.

4186
02:17:58,970 --> 02:18:00,130
That zipline is so fast.

4187
02:18:00,590 --> 02:18:01,070
There's a red.

4188
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:03,470
There's a red for us here if you need it.

4189
02:18:03,790 --> 02:18:04,290
Oh, nice.

4190
02:18:04,390 --> 02:18:04,970
You should take that.

4191
02:18:04,990 --> 02:18:05,110
Yeah, yeah.

4192
02:18:05,130 --> 02:18:05,450
Refresh.

4193
02:18:05,490 --> 02:18:05,950
Refresh it.

4194
02:18:06,030 --> 02:18:06,770
You should refresh it.

4195
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:08,770
It's a refresh, not a natural red.

4196
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:09,610
Yeah.

4197
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:11,490
Grabbing two grenades.

4198
02:18:12,390 --> 02:18:13,310
Yeah, I'm going to take...

4199
02:18:13,770 --> 02:18:15,530
I am going to grab...

4200
02:18:16,130 --> 02:18:17,010
Wait, do I need batteries?

4201
02:18:17,150 --> 02:18:17,370
No.

4202
02:18:17,490 --> 02:18:18,310
I'm going to grab AA.

4203
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:19,430
We're good.

4204
02:18:19,530 --> 02:18:20,270
We just play that corner, guys.

4205
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:20,910
We're just going to play that corner.

4206
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:21,950
I'm going to grab an A then too.

4207
02:18:22,910 --> 02:18:23,690
How in are we?

4208
02:18:23,690 --> 02:18:24,350
Fighting in that room.

4209
02:18:25,110 --> 02:18:25,590
Kind of.

4210
02:18:25,910 --> 02:18:27,710
Tempo, you got to stay in this corner.

4211
02:18:27,910 --> 02:18:28,230
Our little corner.

4212
02:18:28,230 --> 02:18:28,470
We're good.

4213
02:18:28,470 --> 02:18:30,370
We're going to zip out late game somewhere.

4214
02:18:30,910 --> 02:18:31,790
We have a lot of room actually.

4215
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:34,710
Wait, are we going to die in here?

4216
02:18:35,330 --> 02:18:35,910
No, no, no.

4217
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:36,210
We're good.

4218
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:36,970
We're going to walk out late.

4219
02:18:36,990 --> 02:18:37,650
We're going to walk out late.

4220
02:18:37,650 --> 02:18:37,910
Okay.

4221
02:18:38,090 --> 02:18:38,370
Okay.

4222
02:18:39,930 --> 02:18:40,210
Okay.

4223
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:41,750
Only one of us can peek at a time.

4224
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:42,270
I'm not even kidding.

4225
02:18:42,330 --> 02:18:42,770
I'll peek.

4226
02:18:42,810 --> 02:18:43,070
I'll peek.

4227
02:18:43,510 --> 02:18:43,730
Yeah, yeah.

4228
02:18:43,830 --> 02:18:44,410
We will peek.

4229
02:18:44,490 --> 02:18:45,270
He has the armor.

4230
02:18:45,430 --> 02:18:46,010
He's one shot.

4231
02:18:46,490 --> 02:18:46,970
Fuck me.

4232
02:18:48,530 --> 02:18:49,470
Jump again, you little bitch.

4233
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:52,370
Guys, I have 56 damage.

4234
02:18:53,050 --> 02:18:53,610
Nice job.

4235
02:18:56,910 --> 02:18:57,550
I'm contributing.

4236
02:18:58,030 --> 02:18:59,030
Alright, what we're going to do here, guys.

4237
02:18:59,230 --> 02:19:01,130
Did you see this little cliff here late game?

4238
02:19:01,390 --> 02:19:02,470
We're going to go to this cliff here late.

4239
02:19:02,650 --> 02:19:02,910
Okay?

4240
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:04,490
We're going to literally walk out left.

4241
02:19:04,630 --> 02:19:06,570
We're going to walk into the front door and we're going to go out to the left side.

4242
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:07,030
Okay.

4243
02:19:08,690 --> 02:19:11,110
We're going to have to go pretty early though because we can't fucking get killed.

4244
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:12,670
Fucking through storm.

4245
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:13,750
I believe.

4246
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:15,470
I'm going to need to grab this Mozambique.

4247
02:19:16,430 --> 02:19:16,670
Wait.

4248
02:19:16,730 --> 02:19:18,130
Is there a heat shield?

4249
02:19:18,290 --> 02:19:20,030
Because we can have that one second heat shield.

4250
02:19:20,210 --> 02:19:20,290
No.

4251
02:19:20,290 --> 02:19:21,610
They do the tournament mode.

4252
02:19:21,870 --> 02:19:23,470
Oh, it's tournament mode.

4253
02:19:24,210 --> 02:19:26,810
We got to wait six seconds.

4254
02:19:27,470 --> 02:19:28,030
We're going to go now.

4255
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,330
Go now.

4256
02:19:28,350 --> 02:19:28,530
Go now.

4257
02:19:28,530 --> 02:19:28,970
Go to the cliff.

4258
02:19:28,990 --> 02:19:29,250
Go to the cliff.

4259
02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:29,490
Go to the cliff.

4260
02:19:30,510 --> 02:19:31,090
Jump to the cliff.

4261
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,610
Jump to the cliff side.

4262
02:19:32,130 --> 02:19:32,490
Right here.

4263
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:33,410
I'm here.

4264
02:19:33,430 --> 02:19:33,570
Right here.

4265
02:19:33,630 --> 02:19:33,970
Come here.

4266
02:19:34,390 --> 02:19:34,750
We're good.

4267
02:19:35,230 --> 02:19:35,850
We're going to look left.

4268
02:19:35,930 --> 02:19:36,610
We're going to look left immediately.

4269
02:19:36,910 --> 02:19:37,530
Look at these kids.

4270
02:19:37,590 --> 02:19:38,150
They're going to try to shoot us.

4271
02:19:38,770 --> 02:19:39,010
Okay.

4272
02:19:39,130 --> 02:19:40,190
They're going to be kids right above us too.

4273
02:19:40,350 --> 02:19:40,710
No, we're good.

4274
02:19:40,730 --> 02:19:40,930
We're good.

4275
02:19:40,930 --> 02:19:41,110
We're good.

4276
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:41,730
We're so good.

4277
02:19:41,790 --> 02:19:41,990
We're so good.

4278
02:19:41,990 --> 02:19:42,630
Just stare left.

4279
02:19:42,730 --> 02:19:43,210
Someone stare left.

4280
02:19:43,430 --> 02:19:43,670
I'm staring.

4281
02:19:43,770 --> 02:19:44,050
I'm staring.

4282
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:44,390
I'm staring.

4283
02:19:44,470 --> 02:19:44,790
You're good.

4284
02:19:44,850 --> 02:19:44,950
You're good.

4285
02:19:44,950 --> 02:19:45,110
You're good.

4286
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:46,090
We're going to walk in late.

4287
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:46,730
We're just going to walk in late.

4288
02:19:46,750 --> 02:19:47,310
We can't really watch here.

4289
02:19:49,370 --> 02:19:50,090
Oh my god.

4290
02:19:50,110 --> 02:19:51,070
How is there six teams still alive?

4291
02:19:51,090 --> 02:19:51,990
At least can they move over here.

4292
02:19:53,350 --> 02:19:53,770
They're moving over.

4293
02:19:53,850 --> 02:19:54,610
The full team on my right.

4294
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:55,090
On here.

4295
02:19:55,170 --> 02:19:55,290
Yeah.

4296
02:19:55,290 --> 02:19:55,410
Shoot this guy.

4297
02:19:55,410 --> 02:19:55,810
Shoot this guy.

4298
02:19:55,810 --> 02:19:56,030
Shoot this guy.

4299
02:19:56,310 --> 02:19:56,670
I'm shooting.

4300
02:19:56,670 --> 02:19:56,870
I'm shooting.

4301
02:19:57,390 --> 02:19:57,710
We're good.

4302
02:19:57,770 --> 02:19:57,950
We're good.

4303
02:19:57,970 --> 02:19:58,090
We're good.

4304
02:19:58,090 --> 02:19:58,570
Shoot left.

4305
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:00,070
It's the only team that can kill us right now.

4306
02:20:00,250 --> 02:20:01,310
Tempo is not shooting left.

4307
02:20:01,490 --> 02:20:01,890
I'm watching.

4308
02:20:01,970 --> 02:20:02,250
I'm watching.

4309
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:02,750
No.

4310
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:03,090
He's doing good.

4311
02:20:03,090 --> 02:20:03,410
He's doing good.

4312
02:20:03,410 --> 02:20:03,530
It's fine.

4313
02:20:03,890 --> 02:20:04,130
Okay.

4314
02:20:04,570 --> 02:20:05,970
If someone walks behind us, they're idiots.

4315
02:20:06,110 --> 02:20:06,510
They shouldn't.

4316
02:20:06,550 --> 02:20:06,850
Yeah.

4317
02:20:06,930 --> 02:20:07,770
I'm watching behind us.

4318
02:20:07,850 --> 02:20:08,010
Okay.

4319
02:20:09,310 --> 02:20:09,670
Okay.

4320
02:20:09,670 --> 02:20:10,030
Here.

4321
02:20:10,110 --> 02:20:10,210
Here.

4322
02:20:10,210 --> 02:20:10,390
Here.

4323
02:20:10,390 --> 02:20:10,730
They're looking.

4324
02:20:10,770 --> 02:20:11,030
They're looking.

4325
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:11,130
They're looking.

4326
02:20:11,710 --> 02:20:12,270
On us.

4327
02:20:12,530 --> 02:20:12,890
Yeah.

4328
02:20:12,890 --> 02:20:13,250
They're looking.

4329
02:20:13,930 --> 02:20:14,650
No, bro.

4330
02:20:14,710 --> 02:20:16,130
Right when I stopped peeking.

4331
02:20:16,130 --> 02:20:16,170
No.

4332
02:20:16,170 --> 02:20:17,450
I said they're looking.

4333
02:20:18,850 --> 02:20:20,230
I'm going to stop looking.

4334
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:22,270
Why didn't you stop looking?

4335
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:22,450
I threw.

4336
02:20:22,450 --> 02:20:22,690
I threw.

4337
02:20:22,730 --> 02:20:23,090
I threw.

4338
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:23,230
No.

4339
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:23,590
I threw.

4340
02:20:23,650 --> 02:20:23,950
I threw.

4341
02:20:24,030 --> 02:20:24,730
I threw.

4342
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:25,510
I threw.

4343
02:20:25,650 --> 02:20:26,050
I threw.

4344
02:20:26,050 --> 02:20:26,250
I threw.

4345
02:20:26,310 --> 02:20:27,370
Of course I threw.

4346
02:20:27,530 --> 02:20:28,410
And I got wounded.

4347
02:20:28,510 --> 02:20:32,070
The moment they stopped looking.

4348
02:20:32,130 --> 02:20:33,130
You stopped looking.

4349
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:34,670
I sold.

4350
02:20:34,670 --> 02:20:36,530
I sold like a fucking car salesman.

4351
02:20:38,750 --> 02:20:42,930
They pushed the timing.

4352
02:20:43,290 --> 02:20:44,570
And now my camera fell.

4353
02:20:44,870 --> 02:20:46,690
Now my camera's on the floor.

4354
02:20:47,710 --> 02:20:49,450
My whole setup just fell.

4355
02:20:51,150 --> 02:20:52,010
Bro, wait.

4356
02:20:52,150 --> 02:20:54,530
I think today's just not your day.

4357
02:20:54,910 --> 02:20:57,270
I think today's just not your day.

4358
02:20:57,410 --> 02:20:58,190
Oh my god.

4359
02:20:58,210 --> 02:20:58,850
He died too.

4360
02:21:06,020 --> 02:21:07,140
Oh man.

4361
02:21:11,740 --> 02:21:13,060
Guys, it's okay.

4362
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:14,560
We got six guys.

4363
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:15,820
That's a lot of points.

4364
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:18,340
A lot of points.

4365
02:21:19,380 --> 02:21:20,780
We got six.

4366
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:22,680
We got six guys.

4367
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:24,240
I trolled that, guys.

4368
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:28,820
Guys, you fucking threw that, man.

4369
02:21:31,580 --> 02:21:33,780
I'm sick to my stomach, dude.

4370
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:34,860
Okay, we're back.

4371
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:40,240
I have to go pee like every 15 minutes.

4372
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:40,640
Why?

4373
02:21:41,220 --> 02:21:42,180
That's not healthy.

4374
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:44,060
That's not healthy at all.

4375
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:45,720
There might be something wrong.

4376
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:46,620
I had a bunch of energy drinks.

4377
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:47,760
I just have to keep peeing.

4378
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:48,700
What?

4379
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:51,000
God.

4380
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:54,100
Bro, you must be super dehydrated.

4381
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:55,040
That is not healthy.

4382
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:55,520
Top six?

4383
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:56,820
Top six is not bad.

4384
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:57,700
How did I not get one?

4385
02:21:57,760 --> 02:21:59,360
Top six is pretty decent.

4386
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:01,660
We're at eight now.

4387
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:03,860
Yay, eight points.

4388
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:05,280
Yay.

4389
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:06,740
We got eight points in total.

4390
02:22:07,580 --> 02:22:09,480
Wait, how do you wait?

4391
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:10,500
You are ass.

4392
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,260
Fandom.

4393
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:13,440
Fandom.

4394
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:14,740
Why?

4395
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:16,080
What did I do to knock?

4396
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:17,480
Fandom.

4397
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:19,800
Do it.

4398
02:22:19,860 --> 02:22:20,380
No pause.

4399
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:22,400
What did I do to knock, bro?

4400
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:23,960
Okay.

4401
02:22:24,860 --> 02:22:25,980
Where's Greek?

4402
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:27,160
Okay, Greek is team 14.

4403
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:28,520
Team 14.

4404
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:31,280
Team 14 got 19 plays with zero kills.

4405
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:33,620
So, they're actually last last.

4406
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:35,340
Oh, my God.

4407
02:22:35,380 --> 02:22:36,240
They're probably malding right now.

4408
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:36,820
I'm so happy.

4409
02:22:36,980 --> 02:22:38,540
Bro, they're actually last last.

4410
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:41,540
We're not last because we got points with placements.

4411
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:43,440
That's so good for us, dude.

4412
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:46,620
My camera is so fucking boxed right now.

4413
02:22:47,620 --> 02:22:49,600
My whole camera service is fucked.

4414
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:52,600
This is crazy, dude.

4415
02:22:53,380 --> 02:22:54,360
Alright, new goal.

4416
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:55,060
Not last.

4417
02:22:55,180 --> 02:22:55,980
That's my new goal.

4418
02:22:56,800 --> 02:22:57,720
That wasn't last.

4419
02:22:57,760 --> 02:22:58,080
We did it.

4420
02:22:58,240 --> 02:22:58,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4421
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,400
We got it.

4422
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:00,120
We got it.

4423
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:05,160
As long as Greek's team does not have a winning game, we're fine.

4424
02:23:05,980 --> 02:23:06,540
That's what I'm saying.

4425
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:09,000
That's what I really care about.

4426
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:09,720
Yeah.

4427
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:12,560
Is that not winning?

4428
02:23:14,540 --> 02:23:16,760
Your roommate doesn't win at all.

4429
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:18,960
Is that what you want?

4430
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:19,560
I can't explain to you.

4431
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:23,280
Right when I looked away, they pushed.

4432
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:24,680
Yeah, I know.

4433
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:25,920
I was like, where did you go?

4434
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:28,240
I looked back and you were gone.

4435
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:29,880
I fucked it up so bad.

4436
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:32,280
I was like, where did you go?

4437
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:38,800
Where did my other person go when he said this is the only angle that matters?

4438
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:43,220
And then I immediately just looked at the other team.

4439
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:45,160
Right when I said that.

4440
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:45,660
That is insane.

4441
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:50,540
I just completely blacked out because I just saw a full three man in the back.

4442
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:52,040
I did like 800 damage to him too.

4443
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:52,620
That was crazy.

4444
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:54,880
I got too horny.

4445
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:55,460
This is what it is.

4446
02:23:55,740 --> 02:23:57,180
Alright, Wizards top six.

4447
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:58,080
Next one's top five.

4448
02:23:58,100 --> 02:23:58,260
Yeah?

4449
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:00,660
Is that how math works?

4450
02:24:00,740 --> 02:24:01,420
Next one's top five?

4451
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:03,100
Yeah.

4452
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:04,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4453
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:05,740
We got this.

4454
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:07,120
Okay.

4455
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:10,020
Command center with Snipe's team.

4456
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:11,100
Jurassic is open.

4457
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:13,200
There's two teams contesting Stormcatcher.

4458
02:24:13,720 --> 02:24:15,000
Jurassic's terrible, bro.

4459
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:16,880
So do we want Jurassic bald?

4460
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:19,200
Oh my god, Jurassic's so bad.

4461
02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:24,600
Isn't Jurassic way worse loot than anywhere else we can go?

4462
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:29,120
But on this map that I googled, it has a beacon.

4463
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:32,040
That means we get a beacon.

4464
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:33,780
We're not contesting that Jurassic if we go there.

4465
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:34,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4466
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:37,740
Because somehow we still didn't have a beacon at Geyser.

4467
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:38,500
Let's do it.

4468
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:39,000
Let's do it.

4469
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:39,380
Let's do it.

4470
02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:39,920
Let's just go Jurassic.

4471
02:24:40,060 --> 02:24:40,100
Alright.

4472
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:43,720
If we go Jurassic and there's a beacon at command center?

4473
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:45,340
Well, no.

4474
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:46,880
There's a team command center too.

4475
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:47,820
Yeah, yeah, that's fair.

4476
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:48,500
Okay, let's go Jurassic.

4477
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:49,480
No, no, no, no.

4478
02:24:49,900 --> 02:24:50,360
This is it.

4479
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:50,860
This is it.

4480
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:53,200
Wait, wait.

4481
02:24:56,820 --> 02:24:57,140
What?

4482
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:58,820
What happened?

4483
02:25:00,060 --> 02:25:02,480
I was going to do the same thing.

4484
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:03,280
I was going to do the same thing.

4485
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:03,660
Can we?

4486
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:04,400
Is there a crafter at Jurassic?

4487
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:04,500
Can we?

4488
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:05,540
Is there a crafter at Jurassic?

4489
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:08,700
I mean, Temple, we got nothing out of you doing that.

4490
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:10,160
Yeah, we got beacon.

4491
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:13,820
I scanned Harvester's beacon when I ran back.

4492
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:14,080
I scanned Harvester's beacon when I ran back.

4493
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,600
But if we have beacon here, we don't need it.

4494
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:17,140
So let's see first.

4495
02:25:17,580 --> 02:25:18,120
Alright, alright.

4496
02:25:18,220 --> 02:25:18,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4497
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:23,300
And if not, I'll go third Stormcatcher, scan beacon, and then die.

4498
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:24,000
And if not, I'll go third Stormcatcher, scan beacon, and then die.

4499
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, because we have crafter.

4500
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:25,880
We have crafter.

4501
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:28,060
Yeah, and two teams are contesting as Stormcatcher.

4502
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:28,600
So we're good.

4503
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:29,600
It's the exact same plan.

4504
02:25:29,780 --> 02:25:30,140
Yep.

4505
02:25:30,520 --> 02:25:31,260
This is it.

4506
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:32,740
Yep.

4507
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:33,480
Okay, wait.

4508
02:25:33,620 --> 02:25:35,120
Okay, so what are the legends?

4509
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:37,700
What are the legends that's our...

4510
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:44,340
Because, like, our strategy also relies on what legends we can play too.

4511
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:46,560
We're all locked in.

4512
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:52,780
No, I think, like, letting Tempo be free actually made our gameplay so much better.

4513
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:53,480
I think so too.

4514
02:25:53,660 --> 02:25:53,860
Yeah.

4515
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:54,840
We don't have to worry about him.

4516
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:55,860
Yeah, we don't have to worry about him.

4517
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:58,040
We just have to let him... we just have to free him.

4518
02:25:58,180 --> 02:25:59,160
Then roam around.

4519
02:25:59,480 --> 02:25:59,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4520
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:01,560
Then do what he wants to do.

4521
02:26:03,140 --> 02:26:03,840
Oh, man.

4522
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:06,640
It's okay, guys.

4523
02:26:06,740 --> 02:26:07,400
We're not last.

4524
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:08,560
We are.

4525
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:12,000
Okay, so Tempo Travels is raiding and also just giving 25 subs to whoever...

4526
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:12,980
a random streamer that's involved.

4527
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:13,460
That's pretty cool.

4528
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:14,000
Oh!

4529
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:17,500
Ballistic Wraith Rev Valk Cat Mirage.

4530
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:19,760
Okay, so clearly Wig should play Valk.

4531
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:20,060
Oh, no, wait.

4532
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:21,480
There's a Fuse in there too.

4533
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:22,600
Clearly Wig!

4534
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:31,000
I think a unanimous decision for the squad is that Tempo's not on Valk.

4535
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:31,680
Yes.

4536
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:36,020
The moment Tempo was on Valk, we got 20th!

4537
02:26:36,360 --> 02:26:37,260
You're so right.

4538
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:37,700
You're so right.

4539
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:42,120
Okay, and then Tempo will play Calus, right?

4540
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:44,640
And then I'll be Mirage for the crafting.

4541
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:48,000
I think...

4542
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:50,560
You're playing Mirage?

4543
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:51,000
For sure.

4544
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:51,640
We need the crafting.

4545
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:52,000
Where should I play?

4546
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:53,220
No!

4547
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:53,920
No!

4548
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:57,320
Are you comfortable on Mirage?

4549
02:26:57,500 --> 02:26:57,840
Oh, yeah.

4550
02:26:57,900 --> 02:26:59,100
I'm very comfortable on Mirage.

4551
02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:00,960
Why are you so comfortable?

4552
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:01,900
I do not believe her.

4553
02:27:02,180 --> 02:27:04,080
Why do I not trust what she's saying?

4554
02:27:04,980 --> 02:27:06,140
I'm so comfortable.

4555
02:27:06,580 --> 02:27:06,940
Oh, yeah.

4556
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:07,780
I'm comfortable.

4557
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:09,620
I'm so comfortable on Mirage.

4558
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:10,300
Don't worry.

4559
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:13,140
Don't worry.

4560
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:16,160
When you see my banner, you'll understand.

4561
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:20,140
It also has zero kills?

4562
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:20,920
No!

4563
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:22,400
No, no, no!

4564
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:24,060
No, no, no, no, no!

4565
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:26,700
Look at my Season 5 win!

4566
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:36,180
I'm so comfortable on Mirage when it was Season 5.

4567
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:38,620
When it was Season...

4568
02:27:38,620 --> 02:27:39,200
Okay.

4569
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:40,840
Season 5?

4570
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:42,180
Season 21?

4571
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:44,560
Check my Mirage.

4572
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:45,760
Yep.

4573
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:46,940
Check it.

4574
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:48,700
I'll check it when we go in there.

4575
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:48,980
Check it.

4576
02:27:49,220 --> 02:27:54,900
I'm actually so mad at myself, it's unbelievable that I looked at my Mirage.

4577
02:27:56,060 --> 02:27:56,480
Okay.

4578
02:27:56,480 --> 02:27:57,300
What is wrong with me?

4579
02:27:57,300 --> 02:27:57,880
What am I doing?

4580
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:02,280
I can't blame Tempo.

4581
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:03,520
Yeah, I can't blame him.

4582
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:04,780
You can't blame him.

4583
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:07,840
Yeah, me looking away.

4584
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:09,760
I fucked up, you know what I mean?

4585
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:10,920
I got too horny.

4586
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:12,300
I just got way too horny for the squad.

4587
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:12,840
I saw...

4588
02:28:15,240 --> 02:28:15,660
What?

4589
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:16,900
What the fuck?

4590
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:17,520
You're like...

4591
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:18,960
Your mic.

4592
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:19,960
What the fuck?

4593
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,340
Oh no, it's all going downhill.

4594
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:25,120
It's all going downhill.

4595
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,200
Oh my god.

4596
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:33,420
I still don't know why Nob called me ass.

4597
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:38,320
Did you check my Mirage stats?

4598
02:28:38,740 --> 02:28:40,560
No, are you live right now?

4599
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:42,900
No, just press F.

4600
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:44,220
What?

4601
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:47,180
I've never seen that before.

4602
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:48,860
Oh my god.

4603
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:50,660
You have 3600 kills?

4604
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:55,120
I do have so many Mirages.

4605
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:56,380
Look at my wins.

4606
02:28:56,380 --> 02:28:57,600
Wait, what's Mirage's thing?

4607
02:28:57,840 --> 02:28:58,900
Look at my wins.

4608
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:04,240
I can't believe you played that character that much.

4609
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:08,580
Only in Season 5.

4610
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:11,080
And then I never touched Mirage again.

4611
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:17,100
I was on the Mirage leader points for Season 5.

4612
02:29:18,340 --> 02:29:19,800
Oh my god.

4613
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:20,780
I was!

4614
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:21,740
I was!

4615
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:27,220
I was like top 10 Mirage players because of my Mirage wins.

4616
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:28,680
I was like number 1 in Canada.

4617
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:31,600
Because I had the most Mirage wins in Season 5.

4618
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:33,880
Who the fuck are you?

4619
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:38,540
Why are you in Canada in Season 5?

4620
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:40,620
Because I had the most Mirage wins.

4621
02:29:43,580 --> 02:29:44,500
It's legit!

4622
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:48,840
I remember because I thought it was so funny when I looked at the leaderboards.

4623
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:54,020
You being top in Mirage wins is pretty fucking funny to me.

4624
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:56,560
I'm expecting a carry.

4625
02:29:57,020 --> 02:29:58,280
A Mirage carry.

4626
02:29:59,640 --> 02:30:00,660
In Canada.

4627
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:05,800
The score is updated.

4628
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:07,280
I'll be right back real quick.

4629
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:08,640
It's not updated.

4630
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:12,020
That's right.

4631
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:13,340
Number 1 in Canada.

4632
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:14,740
That's all that matters.

4633
02:30:14,860 --> 02:30:17,440
I was top 10 in the world for Mirage wins.

4634
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:20,140
We're in 18th.

4635
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:21,240
Guys!

4636
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:22,260
We're doing it!

4637
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,940
We're doing it!

4638
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:25,720
Alright.

4639
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:27,980
We need to get to top 10.

4640
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:28,320
Okay?

4641
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:30,900
I just want...

4642
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:34,500
If we get 17th or 16th I'd be happy.

4643
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:35,300
That's really it.

4644
02:30:35,820 --> 02:30:36,380
No.

4645
02:30:36,580 --> 02:30:38,620
We need to get around top 10.

4646
02:30:39,220 --> 02:30:41,820
This is sort of telling me how it's going to be.

4647
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:43,200
in CC right now.

4648
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:45,920
I'm sort of having a feeling where we're at at CC.

4649
02:30:46,940 --> 02:30:48,700
CC will be much easier.

4650
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:49,120
I'm back.

4651
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:49,540
How we looking?

4652
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:51,980
CC people actually scrim!

4653
02:30:52,700 --> 02:30:53,740
CC will be easier.

4654
02:30:54,900 --> 02:30:56,940
People in CC actually scrim!

4655
02:30:57,520 --> 02:30:57,560
No.

4656
02:30:57,660 --> 02:30:58,920
I think Temple's right.

4657
02:30:59,020 --> 02:31:01,840
They shoot like they're not playing with a mouse.

4658
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:02,380
Yeah.

4659
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:02,820
Like Doki.

4660
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:04,000
You're going to tap strafe on kids.

4661
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:04,520
It's going to be crazy.

4662
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:06,440
I'm going to tap strafe on kids.

4663
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:10,580
I'm going to put them in a daycare and do a super glide.

4664
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:13,940
On the play sets.

4665
02:31:14,460 --> 02:31:15,500
Oh my god.

4666
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:20,100
In challenge circuit even I should be able to 1v3 some teams.

4667
02:31:20,300 --> 02:31:20,580
You know what I'm saying?

4668
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:22,140
That's the vibes I have.

4669
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:24,920
Do I have the confidence to do so?

4670
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:25,140
No.

4671
02:31:25,720 --> 02:31:26,200
Yes.

4672
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:28,500
This is our warm up.

4673
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:30,460
This is it.

4674
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:34,680
If there's no beacon, I'm going to go third Stormcatcher.

4675
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:36,840
Steal their beacon.

4676
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:41,720
For some reason this is an unbelievable strat we're doing and it's working.

4677
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:45,500
We just got top 6 with you landing Harvester and us landing Geyser.

4678
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:48,160
I'm not really sure I've ever seen that strat before in any level of Apex Legends.

4679
02:31:48,460 --> 02:31:49,300
My mom's calling me.

4680
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:49,640
One second.

4681
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:52,480
Yeah.

4682
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:53,100
What's up mom?

4683
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:54,500
Hey mom.

4684
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:56,380
Hi mom.

4685
02:31:56,900 --> 02:31:57,840
Doki says hi.

4686
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:58,360
What'd you say?

4687
02:31:58,520 --> 02:31:59,100
Hey mom.

4688
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:02,680
You think I'm better than your son?

4689
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:07,540
Doki wonders if you think she's better than me at Apex.

4690
02:32:12,220 --> 02:32:13,280
I don't know.

4691
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:16,420
I don't know.

4692
02:32:16,460 --> 02:32:16,900
I don't know.

4693
02:32:16,900 --> 02:32:18,380
Bro she doesn't even Bro she doesn't even feel like...

4694
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:23,500
...with her energy and her screaming laughing and just luck like.

4695
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:25,640
She's like the best thing that ever happened.

4696
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:28,200
Bro I'm the best thing that ever happened.

4697
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:29,640
Bro I'm the best thing that ever happened.

4698
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:31,120
I hope I get to need her one day.

4699
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,640
She's awful now now now.

4700
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:35,600
Well now you have to come to land.

4701
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:37,360
I'm the best thing that ever happened.

4702
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:38,780
to Apex.

4703
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:39,360
Alright we're in game.

4704
02:32:39,440 --> 02:32:40,020
I love ya.

4705
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:42,760
Yup yup yup.

4706
02:32:43,740 --> 02:32:44,700
Bye mom I love you.

4707
02:32:44,820 --> 02:32:46,080
Oh my god I got the mom wig.

4708
02:32:46,660 --> 02:32:47,440
Wait who am I playing?

4709
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:47,780
Who am I playing?

4710
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:49,020
You're playing Valk.

4711
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:50,260
Of course you're playing Valk.

4712
02:32:50,780 --> 02:32:51,380
I'm Kat.

4713
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:53,140
I'm Mirage.

4714
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:53,880
Where's Valk?

4715
02:32:54,260 --> 02:32:55,660
Valk is top right.

4716
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:58,980
I knew it.

4717
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:00,720
I knew I was special.

4718
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:05,480
Left, right, middle.

4719
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:05,580
Okay.

4720
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:11,900
Alright let's lock it in.

4721
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:14,080
Yo we got this.

4722
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:15,280
Yeah I got this.

4723
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:17,800
Tempo is not on the character that I'm on.

4724
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:18,420
Which is great.

4725
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:20,440
Look at it!

4726
02:33:20,540 --> 02:33:20,920
Look at it!

4727
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:23,480
409 season 5 Apex wins.

4728
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:23,940
Why is it gold?

4729
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:29,520
Yo we have beacon and command center doesn't it?

4730
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:29,820
Yo we have beacon and command center doesn't it?

4731
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:31,640
Okay then you have to land on it with us.

4732
02:33:31,900 --> 02:33:32,720
We're so good.

4733
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:35,760
Now you actually land with us.

4734
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:36,940
Wait we can't...

4735
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:39,500
We can't do the double scan thing right?

4736
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:40,860
No it doesn't work.

4737
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:42,460
You can scan right now and then scan afterwards too.

4738
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:45,360
I mean there's no point in scanning now and after.

4739
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:46,660
We just wait.

4740
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:50,040
I'm just gonna land here I guess.

4741
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:51,040
Sure buddy.

4742
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:55,700
Wait why does that team right above us seem very close?

4743
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:56,660
Wait what?

4744
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:57,300
Where?

4745
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:02,740
That's not my decoy by the way because I forgot to use my decoy.

4746
02:34:02,760 --> 02:34:03,260
Mirage player.

4747
02:34:03,700 --> 02:34:06,320
You should have sent it at echo and scared the shit out of them.

4748
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:09,340
You should have just fucking scared somebody.

4749
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:10,700
Send them all into command.

4750
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:12,160
Good game last game though guys.

4751
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:18,540
The Loba pick was The Loba pick was definitely the thing to do.

4752
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:19,580
I agree.

4753
02:34:19,700 --> 02:34:20,040
Good job.

4754
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:20,860
Proud of you.

4755
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:21,480
Yeah.

4756
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:22,560
No problem.

4757
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:24,100
Oh my god.

4758
02:34:24,540 --> 02:34:25,880
I have my heirloom too.

4759
02:34:26,420 --> 02:34:27,040
Oh nice.

4760
02:34:27,320 --> 02:34:30,400
This is one of those heirlooms I actually paid money for.

4761
02:34:31,300 --> 02:34:32,260
Do you like that heirloom?

4762
02:34:33,260 --> 02:34:37,980
I think the Mirage statue is like one of the best heirlooms they have.

4763
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:40,060
Yeah.

4764
02:34:40,340 --> 02:34:42,640
I love the animations on it.

4765
02:34:44,260 --> 02:34:46,460
I heavily relate to Mirage.

4766
02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:49,120
I heavily relate to Mirage.

4767
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:50,060
You love yourself that much?

4768
02:34:51,460 --> 02:34:54,220
I heavily relate to a guy that carries a statue around.

4769
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:54,880
I heavily relate to a guy that carries a statue around.

4770
02:34:57,660 --> 02:34:58,980
Actual goals you know.

4771
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:00,540
Yeah 100%.

4772
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:01,680
Tabo hit that beacon baby.

4773
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:02,420
Let's see where we're going.

4774
02:35:03,420 --> 02:35:04,660
Don't forget I have Valkold here soon.

4775
02:35:04,760 --> 02:35:05,720
Did you loot this already?

4776
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:07,900
Did you loot this already?

4777
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:09,480
I did yeah.

4778
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:10,760
I'm going back then.

4779
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:12,840
I'm going to hit this.

4780
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:15,040
We can get a good spot.

4781
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:16,460
We can get a good spot guys.

4782
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:23,220
I'm going to immediately hit this god damn ulti excel and we're going to get going.

4783
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:26,400
Okay guys.

4784
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:26,920
Deal?

4785
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:27,660
Alright I'm here.

4786
02:35:28,700 --> 02:35:29,740
You guys are coming back this way?

4787
02:35:30,300 --> 02:35:31,360
Yeah I'm going to come back to you.

4788
02:35:31,400 --> 02:35:33,080
There's a disruptor here with an alternator.

4789
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:34,520
Oh shit.

4790
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:35,800
That's probably a better one to have.

4791
02:35:35,860 --> 02:35:36,060
It's okay.

4792
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:36,440
No big deal.

4793
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:38,580
I could have got back.

4794
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:40,240
It's right below you.

4795
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:42,140
Oh really?

4796
02:35:42,380 --> 02:35:42,540
Yeah.

4797
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:46,780
It's next to an alternator.

4798
02:35:47,220 --> 02:35:48,260
Oh shit yeah you're right.

4799
02:35:48,380 --> 02:35:48,700
What the fuck?

4800
02:35:48,980 --> 02:35:49,900
Yeah I told you.

4801
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:51,740
Oh my god that's fucking coded.

4802
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:52,260
Thank you.

4803
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:54,120
See?

4804
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:55,280
I'm a good person.

4805
02:35:56,160 --> 02:35:56,660
Yeah sure.

4806
02:35:56,660 --> 02:35:57,420
Alright I was kidding.

4807
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:00,840
I'm going to have ulti here in a little bit.

4808
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:02,900
We're going to probably ulti first then evac.

4809
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:06,400
We want to get for this zone I think we want to get one of these two houses back here.

4810
02:36:06,520 --> 02:36:06,820
Oh yeah.

4811
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:08,040
If it's open.

4812
02:36:08,140 --> 02:36:08,780
We're going to keep moving up.

4813
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:10,720
We're going to go through pylon a little bit more though and we're going to back ulti right here.

4814
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:11,480
Up top.

4815
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:13,900
I don't know how far we can actually go though.

4816
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:17,040
I'm right behind you.

4817
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:18,120
I still need to see a...

4818
02:36:20,180 --> 02:36:21,200
Like a scope.

4819
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:25,700
Wait I just see a scope.

4820
02:36:26,660 --> 02:36:27,540
We can grab this thing right?

4821
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:28,280
Yeah we have to grab the...

4822
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:30,500
We'll definitely do that.

4823
02:36:30,560 --> 02:36:31,180
We need that red band.

4824
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:33,000
You need purple energy?

4825
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:35,460
Purple yeah I do.

4826
02:36:37,100 --> 02:36:37,460
Nice.

4827
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:40,660
You don't even have energy.

4828
02:36:41,060 --> 02:36:42,960
Wait I don't even see this loot.

4829
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:44,720
Getting an ult decoy.

4830
02:36:45,640 --> 02:36:46,000
Reduce.

4831
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:47,220
Oh that's a revive with health.

4832
02:36:49,460 --> 02:36:50,680
There's a pack on our right.

4833
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:51,940
Did we want to stop for that or no?

4834
02:36:52,040 --> 02:36:54,240
No I think we have to get a zone.

4835
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:56,000
Someone definitely landed here though.

4836
02:36:56,660 --> 02:36:56,920
Yeah we did.

4837
02:36:57,940 --> 02:36:58,360
Don't worry.

4838
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:00,580
My mirage clone will distract him.

4839
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:01,440
Good shit.

4840
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:02,860
We're going to try to get a left side tree and ulti over.

4841
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:03,080
Okay?

4842
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:05,280
I keep forgetting to scan packs bro.

4843
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:08,620
It's a fucking gold master.

4844
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:09,500
If only we needed that shit.

4845
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:10,560
Yeah it's fine.

4846
02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:12,500
We're going to go to tree and then ulti over.

4847
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:15,900
Oh my god I have five nades.

4848
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:17,360
What the fuck am I going to do with five nades?

4849
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:19,800
I don't know.

4850
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:20,340
Throw them?

4851
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:23,260
I don't know if we have to live long enough for that.

4852
02:37:26,080 --> 02:37:26,640
I don't know if we have to live long enough for that.

4853
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:28,220
The chances of you throwing five is pretty crazy.

4854
02:37:28,900 --> 02:37:29,600
Alright ready?

4855
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:32,620
Oh my god we're so...

4856
02:37:32,620 --> 02:37:33,820
Wouldn't it be funny if you got shot?

4857
02:37:34,180 --> 02:37:35,880
It would be so funny.

4858
02:37:36,060 --> 02:37:39,120
It would be so funny if you got shot.

4859
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:41,720
I feel like tempo is still running.

4860
02:37:42,040 --> 02:37:42,740
I feel like tempo is still running.

4861
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:45,560
This could be the end of us or the start of us.

4862
02:37:45,740 --> 02:37:49,260
Alright we're going to try to go back side.

4863
02:37:49,460 --> 02:37:50,320
Just let me know if you see anyone.

4864
02:37:50,400 --> 02:37:51,200
We're going for this building back here.

4865
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,540
Well there's obviously somebody there.

4866
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:54,360
No I'm the building in the back.

4867
02:37:55,420 --> 02:37:56,580
Yep there is there is there is.

4868
02:37:56,580 --> 02:37:57,780
Oh there is there is there is.

4869
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:00,480
We're going to go back to the terrace.

4870
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:01,000
We're good we're good.

4871
02:38:02,740 --> 02:38:04,160
This is so easy to play.

4872
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:04,760
We're chilling.

4873
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:06,320
Oh you're good you're good.

4874
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:08,760
I'm so good.

4875
02:38:13,640 --> 02:38:14,820
We're so good.

4876
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:16,080
Behind us?

4877
02:38:16,480 --> 02:38:18,480
Yeah like driving behind and open.

4878
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:20,280
I'm going to open this bin.

4879
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:25,180
Let's see.

4880
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:27,000
Honest question.

4881
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:28,640
Giving your input.

4882
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:31,200
Do you think that this tunnel is better for us or staying on staircases better?

4883
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:33,280
I honestly have no idea.

4884
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:35,460
It's up to you.

4885
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:38,160
I think we're going to stay here to be honest.

4886
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:41,900
Can I be playing tunnel without a actual good defensive character?

4887
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:44,840
I have like 18 nades for some reason.

4888
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:46,080
Alright.

4889
02:38:46,300 --> 02:38:47,920
I have like two syringes.

4890
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,620
I haven't found single syringes anywhere.

4891
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:54,020
You bitch bro.

4892
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:54,500
Don't shoot me.

4893
02:38:54,740 --> 02:38:55,720
Wait my game lagged.

4894
02:38:58,340 --> 02:38:59,120
I have a glitch.

4895
02:38:59,160 --> 02:38:59,560
I have a glitch.

4896
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:03,400
I can't heal.

4897
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:04,800
I literally can't heal.

4898
02:39:04,860 --> 02:39:05,200
I have a glitch.

4899
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:06,240
Wait what?

4900
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:08,800
Every time I heal my screen goes blackouts.

4901
02:39:08,880 --> 02:39:09,220
Come back to me.

4902
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:12,800
I just threw 18 nades at them.

4903
02:39:13,300 --> 02:39:14,020
Yeah you're good.

4904
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:14,700
My game is fucked.

4905
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:17,100
Okay so you can't do that.

4906
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:20,440
My deal shows like a...

4907
02:39:22,260 --> 02:39:23,340
Are you cheating?

4908
02:39:23,580 --> 02:39:24,980
No an arm in my face.

4909
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:26,220
I have a whole arm in my face.

4910
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:29,860
But you still can't heal.

4911
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:31,480
It's just a visual bug.

4912
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:32,900
I can't see anything while I heal.

4913
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:33,600
Oh okay.

4914
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:37,720
My whole chat is being caught.

4915
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:40,160
Oh no destroyer.

4916
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:40,640
I'm cheating.

4917
02:39:41,140 --> 02:39:41,620
Destroyer.

4918
02:39:44,080 --> 02:39:44,820
Destroyer is here baby.

4919
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:47,780
Destroyer don't worry.

4920
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:49,000
How is our tournament?

4921
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:50,000
Destroyer.

4922
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:53,800
Yeah he has like so many people watching him.

4923
02:39:54,760 --> 02:39:55,240
Yeah.

4924
02:39:55,800 --> 02:39:56,240
Exactly.

4925
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:57,200
Why me man?

4926
02:39:57,320 --> 02:39:59,720
Yeah you want publicity go for hell.

4927
02:40:00,300 --> 02:40:01,460
Yeah you'll get it.

4928
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:02,860
Yeah you'll get all that publicity.

4929
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:03,960
So many tweets.

4930
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:05,460
Yeah so many engagement.

4931
02:40:05,660 --> 02:40:07,220
Think of the engagement destroyer.

4932
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:09,260
Yeah the impressions.

4933
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:11,020
Oh my god all the impressions.

4934
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:12,780
I don't think I want to peek anymore guys.

4935
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:13,660
I don't have a lot of heals.

4936
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:17,380
Wait landing?

4937
02:40:17,660 --> 02:40:19,280
Tunnel tunnel tunnel.

4938
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:19,480
Tunnel tunnel tunnel.

4939
02:40:22,740 --> 02:40:23,260
Cracked one.

4940
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:26,020
How are you guys peeking in?

4941
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:27,860
Oh boy.

4942
02:40:28,180 --> 02:40:28,580
Where?

4943
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:30,880
The right side.

4944
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:33,140
Okay they're gonna be on silo.

4945
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,760
Yeah I'm just gonna stay down here in the stairs.

4946
02:40:36,620 --> 02:40:38,500
I'm gonna show a little prep so we don't get sent on.

4947
02:40:38,820 --> 02:40:40,260
My fucking mirage clone.

4948
02:40:40,940 --> 02:40:43,360
Oh my god the fact that I can't see anything is crazy bro.

4949
02:40:43,500 --> 02:40:45,320
I have 10 cells and 2 cats.

4950
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:46,040
There you go.

4951
02:40:46,120 --> 02:40:47,920
He's just gonna stand there and he'll let us know.

4952
02:40:48,700 --> 02:40:50,000
Yeah actually good comms wait.

4953
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:51,240
Yeah.

4954
02:40:51,380 --> 02:40:53,260
He'll be like what is this mirage doing in the open?

4955
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:56,800
Dude this is gonna fuck me over so hard if we actually play.

4956
02:40:56,960 --> 02:40:58,320
This like this is gonna be so bad.

4957
02:40:58,800 --> 02:41:00,480
I literally can't heal with my gun fight.

4958
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:01,960
It's crazy.

4959
02:41:03,640 --> 02:41:04,740
Why nerf us?

4960
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:06,320
Yeah why nerf us?

4961
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:10,180
If you rejoin do you think that would help?

4962
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:15,900
Bro if he does that he's gonna fucking we're gonna have a team push the moment he does that.

4963
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:17,660
If I leave it doesn't fix anything.

4964
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:18,840
I think it's just a visual bug in my game.

4965
02:41:20,940 --> 02:41:21,940
I just get sent on and I'm just gone.

4966
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:22,620
Yeah yeah.

4967
02:41:24,540 --> 02:41:25,500
Shoot my clone.

4968
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:28,380
He's literally having a fun time in the open.

4969
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:30,520
He's real.

4970
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:34,100
Imagine that's just you and they're not shooting you because they think it's a clone.

4971
02:41:34,260 --> 02:41:35,080
Oh my god I should.

4972
02:41:35,180 --> 02:41:35,940
Do you guys wanna try that?

4973
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:38,160
Yeah you should do it right now.

4974
02:41:38,660 --> 02:41:39,020
Okay.

4975
02:41:40,920 --> 02:41:41,640
Okay nevermind.

4976
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:43,740
Nevermind look.

4977
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:44,760
I ran through it immediately.

4978
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:48,140
I'm not gonna peek anymore.

4979
02:41:48,140 --> 02:41:48,480
I'm stupid.

4980
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:48,980
I'm done.

4981
02:41:49,780 --> 02:41:52,560
Oh yeah I love seeing a bright yellow thing in my face.

4982
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:53,200
This is fire.

4983
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:55,360
Where am I?

4984
02:41:55,540 --> 02:41:56,220
I can't see.

4985
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:00,620
The syringe is half.

4986
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:04,300
My screen is covered half with the syringe.

4987
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:05,540
It's ridiculous bro.

4988
02:42:06,060 --> 02:42:07,800
Why does no one want to shoot me?

4989
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:11,600
Don't shoot her.

4990
02:42:17,660 --> 02:42:20,500
I don't know if that guy is actually trying to shoot my clone or not.

4991
02:42:21,140 --> 02:42:22,260
I saw straight bullets.

4992
02:42:22,380 --> 02:42:24,040
How is my clone traveling so far?

4993
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:25,440
He shot him.

4994
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:28,380
He got bamboozled 50 meters away.

4995
02:42:29,140 --> 02:42:30,140
Get on nerd.

4996
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:35,120
Okay do you think this is a mirage clone?

4997
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:36,020
Are they gonna shoot me?

4998
02:42:37,080 --> 02:42:38,280
Shoot her for the scan please.

4999
02:42:41,890 --> 02:42:43,710
If I die I blame Wig.

5000
02:42:43,870 --> 02:42:45,130
Because I'm doing something dumb.

5001
02:42:47,370 --> 02:42:48,510
I'm not getting shot at.

5002
02:42:48,610 --> 02:42:49,470
I'm not getting shot at.

5003
02:42:50,690 --> 02:42:51,950
I'm not getting shot at.

5004
02:42:54,550 --> 02:42:55,510
It works.

5005
02:42:56,030 --> 02:42:56,510
It works.

5006
02:42:56,510 --> 02:42:58,490
That is fucking crazy bro.

5007
02:43:00,190 --> 02:43:02,350
They actually let me just run around.

5008
02:43:03,450 --> 02:43:04,070
They actually let me just run around.

5009
02:43:04,070 --> 02:43:04,310
No way.

5010
02:43:04,690 --> 02:43:06,930
I peeped my head for a second and got lit the fuck up.

5011
02:43:07,170 --> 02:43:08,410
I peeped my head for a second and got lit the fuck up.

5012
02:43:10,890 --> 02:43:14,510
Alright hopefully guys a minute left we'll see the damage you're on Zelen.

5013
02:43:14,550 --> 02:43:15,810
I think it's going right towards us.

5014
02:43:18,790 --> 02:43:22,570
I don't know if they're shooting me or what they are.

5015
02:43:23,810 --> 02:43:24,530
Wait they are!

5016
02:43:24,770 --> 02:43:24,970
No!

5017
02:43:25,870 --> 02:43:28,070
Okay now I'm not doing that again.

5018
02:43:28,330 --> 02:43:28,910
We're good.

5019
02:43:30,870 --> 02:43:33,290
I have one shield still left because I fucked around.

5020
02:43:35,270 --> 02:43:35,970
Don't hit me.

5021
02:43:38,470 --> 02:43:38,910
Okay.

5022
02:43:39,470 --> 02:43:42,030
I fucked around a little so now I have one shield still left.

5023
02:43:42,630 --> 02:43:43,070
Nice.

5024
02:43:43,090 --> 02:43:43,790
How many do you have Sambo?

5025
02:43:44,370 --> 02:43:47,190
I have one five now.

5026
02:43:47,490 --> 02:43:49,650
I am two five.

5027
02:43:51,110 --> 02:43:51,550
Alrighty.

5028
02:43:51,770 --> 02:43:51,990
Alrighty.

5029
02:43:52,130 --> 02:43:52,350
Alrighty.

5030
02:43:52,390 --> 02:43:52,610
Alrighty.

5031
02:43:52,890 --> 02:43:53,110
Let's see.

5032
02:43:53,130 --> 02:43:53,430
Let's see.

5033
02:43:53,450 --> 02:43:53,870
Come on baby.

5034
02:43:54,010 --> 02:43:54,450
Come on.

5035
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:54,690
Come on.

5036
02:43:54,690 --> 02:43:54,910
Come on.

5037
02:43:54,910 --> 02:43:55,150
Come on.

5038
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:00,280
I'm real.

5039
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:03,760
Chat we think if the zone comes here or what?

5040
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:04,800
I don't think so.

5041
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:07,000
Come on.

5042
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:09,580
Yes you do.

5043
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:09,820
Yes you do.

5044
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:13,500
Let's see it pull to the other side.

5045
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:15,560
Come on right here.

5046
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:16,480
Let's see it pull.

5047
02:44:18,260 --> 02:44:19,380
We're so good.

5048
02:44:19,580 --> 02:44:20,080
We're so good.

5049
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:20,600
Wait.

5050
02:44:22,640 --> 02:44:23,540
Is anyone in armory?

5051
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:24,920
We're so good.

5052
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:25,840
We're going to get sent on though.

5053
02:44:26,180 --> 02:44:26,880
We're so good.

5054
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:29,840
Did we just play Backside Rock over here now?

5055
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:31,840
Isn't there people there?

5056
02:44:32,400 --> 02:44:33,060
I don't think so.

5057
02:44:34,980 --> 02:44:35,600
I mean we could.

5058
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:36,740
It's only there for now.

5059
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:37,180
It's only there for now.

5060
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:38,640
We're going to hold out Southwest.

5061
02:44:38,940 --> 02:44:39,800
We're going to literally hold out Southwest.

5062
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:40,160
That's the goal.

5063
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:44,120
These guys need to die on the rotation end.

5064
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:46,280
Oh I stuck my decoy in there.

5065
02:44:48,100 --> 02:44:48,920
I thought that was you.

5066
02:44:50,280 --> 02:44:50,600
Okay.

5067
02:44:50,720 --> 02:44:52,920
So Southwest is going to be our number one enemy here guys.

5068
02:44:53,180 --> 02:44:53,480
Okay.

5069
02:44:53,480 --> 02:44:54,600
I'm going to start cleaning out soon too.

5070
02:44:54,740 --> 02:44:54,980
Okay.

5071
02:44:55,540 --> 02:44:57,680
I don't know if I want to waste some meds though.

5072
02:45:03,180 --> 02:45:04,980
I'm not sure if I want to waste these meds.

5073
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:12,240
Yeah Tempo stop peeking I think.

5074
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:14,760
Yeah definitely stop peeking Tempo.

5075
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:15,060
For sure.

5076
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:18,400
Don't worry I'm going to see if I can grab intel.

5077
02:45:19,420 --> 02:45:21,500
I'm just peeking so I can make sure these guys know that we're looking at them.

5078
02:45:22,820 --> 02:45:23,420
Yeah yeah yeah.

5079
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:26,260
Wait are they actually sniping my decoy and missing?

5080
02:45:26,460 --> 02:45:26,980
I think they are.

5081
02:45:27,460 --> 02:45:27,960
They did.

5082
02:45:35,180 --> 02:45:37,380
They know we have to go this way, that's why.

5083
02:45:37,540 --> 02:45:38,400
They can go the other way.

5084
02:45:38,500 --> 02:45:39,900
Should we not go to the rock now or wait?

5085
02:45:41,100 --> 02:45:42,200
Nah, I think we just stay here for now.

5086
02:45:42,980 --> 02:45:45,300
I don't really want to jump too early and then we just get fucking shit on.

5087
02:45:45,480 --> 02:45:46,300
And we stop Valk ult.

5088
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:47,420
Yeah, we do.

5089
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:47,680
Yeah.

5090
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:50,340
I just don't know if anyone's back there and we Valk ult and then they take our spot.

5091
02:45:52,140 --> 02:45:52,760
It's the only problem.

5092
02:45:53,140 --> 02:45:53,840
Yeah, that's true.

5093
02:45:56,640 --> 02:45:57,260
Alright, let's see where they go.

5094
02:45:58,240 --> 02:45:59,200
Let's keep looking over here.

5095
02:45:59,420 --> 02:46:00,600
Just don't take too much damage.

5096
02:46:00,780 --> 02:46:02,060
Someone dropped down here.

5097
02:46:02,340 --> 02:46:04,180
I think they're leaving us.

5098
02:46:05,080 --> 02:46:05,980
One other tunnel.

5099
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:08,940
There's only two that left that I saw.

5100
02:46:09,400 --> 02:46:10,480
All three there.

5101
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:11,920
Yeah, I just saw.

5102
02:46:12,500 --> 02:46:13,240
We're doing it.

5103
02:46:15,060 --> 02:46:16,320
I just got bamboozled.

5104
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:18,060
Oh my god, you got bamboozled too?

5105
02:46:18,680 --> 02:46:19,540
Where's the care pack at?

5106
02:46:19,660 --> 02:46:20,020
I need to scan.

5107
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:20,820
I hear a pack.

5108
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:23,160
To our right.

5109
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:25,200
Woah, woah, woah.

5110
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:27,380
We're good.

5111
02:46:29,720 --> 02:46:30,720
Yeah, you want to do it?

5112
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:31,540
I'll do it back, bitch.

5113
02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:33,600
I don't care.

5114
02:46:33,660 --> 02:46:35,040
That clone didn't really go anywhere.

5115
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:37,720
There's a ragged team back rock.

5116
02:46:38,100 --> 02:46:38,740
Knock that guy.

5117
02:46:38,840 --> 02:46:39,960
Holy shit get shit on him.

5118
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:41,940
I got shot from behind.

5119
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:42,980
There's someone behind that rock.

5120
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:43,740
They're behind the rock now.

5121
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:44,700
Yeah, we're good.

5122
02:46:47,980 --> 02:46:49,100
I don't think we can kill this guy.

5123
02:46:49,240 --> 02:46:49,920
He's sliding down here.

5124
02:46:50,160 --> 02:46:50,640
Oh, nope.

5125
02:46:50,700 --> 02:46:51,700
He went into that tunnel.

5126
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:52,580
Let's see where someone goes.

5127
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:55,080
Someone just pulled back rock.

5128
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:56,580
Where can we go here?

5129
02:46:56,640 --> 02:46:57,620
This is so bad for us actually.

5130
02:46:57,700 --> 02:46:58,060
Holy fuck.

5131
02:46:58,360 --> 02:47:01,520
Well, we can't go behind this because there's a team there now.

5132
02:47:02,480 --> 02:47:03,520
We can't play silo.

5133
02:47:03,580 --> 02:47:03,980
I don't think either.

5134
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:05,160
Silo will just get shot at.

5135
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:08,380
Fuck.

5136
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:11,300
Yeah, they're all the way behind.

5137
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:12,920
I mean, we have Velko.

5138
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:14,640
We have Velko here.

5139
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:17,640
We have the Helm Berry somewhere.

5140
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:20,320
I think we just walk in slow and just go to silo here.

5141
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:22,120
We just walk in slow and try to kill everyone that's inside.

5142
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:23,040
That's all we can do.

5143
02:47:23,420 --> 02:47:24,000
Just play slow.

5144
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:25,020
Don't take any damage.

5145
02:47:25,260 --> 02:47:26,260
Let these teams fight inside.

5146
02:47:26,380 --> 02:47:27,320
We just third party and walk up.

5147
02:47:29,020 --> 02:47:29,780
We're gonna play for the height.

5148
02:47:30,300 --> 02:47:31,120
We'll see if they fight inside.

5149
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:31,800
They should.

5150
02:47:35,490 --> 02:47:36,290
Team flying in.

5151
02:47:36,370 --> 02:47:36,570
We're good.

5152
02:47:37,630 --> 02:47:40,950
Yep, just get some shots down.

5153
02:47:40,990 --> 02:47:41,270
We're all good.

5154
02:47:41,370 --> 02:47:41,990
Oh, they made a walk?

5155
02:47:42,790 --> 02:47:44,670
Yeah, they catwalked.

5156
02:47:44,910 --> 02:47:45,270
That's fine.

5157
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:45,650
Yeah, we're good.

5158
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:48,490
They're fighting whoever's there.

5159
02:47:49,030 --> 02:47:49,870
Yeah, just keep playing here.

5160
02:47:49,930 --> 02:47:50,390
Just keep playing there.

5161
02:47:50,470 --> 02:47:51,130
You guys be playing there.

5162
02:47:51,970 --> 02:47:52,470
Alright, alright.

5163
02:47:53,610 --> 02:47:54,110
We're looking.

5164
02:47:56,370 --> 02:47:57,630
One drop down, right here.

5165
02:47:57,950 --> 02:47:58,370
I'm looking.

5166
02:47:58,850 --> 02:47:59,770
Two drop down.

5167
02:48:00,010 --> 02:48:00,290
Two, yeah.

5168
02:48:01,490 --> 02:48:03,910
Yeah, just keep looking there, guys.

5169
02:48:04,010 --> 02:48:04,830
I'm looking at somebody else right now.

5170
02:48:05,590 --> 02:48:06,350
You guys keep looking there.

5171
02:48:06,350 --> 02:48:07,270
They're not peeking us right now.

5172
02:48:07,470 --> 02:48:07,990
I'm looking at you guys.

5173
02:48:08,170 --> 02:48:08,830
They went up.

5174
02:48:09,550 --> 02:48:10,130
They're going up.

5175
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:10,550
They're going up.

5176
02:48:10,950 --> 02:48:11,510
Yeah, we're good.

5177
02:48:13,130 --> 02:48:13,770
They're on the ramp.

5178
02:48:15,210 --> 02:48:16,330
We need to focus these guys.

5179
02:48:16,410 --> 02:48:16,990
Hardcore left side.

5180
02:48:17,330 --> 02:48:17,750
Left side?

5181
02:48:17,770 --> 02:48:18,070
Yeah, I'm looking.

5182
02:48:18,370 --> 02:48:19,530
I got my kill.

5183
02:48:19,590 --> 02:48:19,850
I got my kill.

5184
02:48:20,630 --> 02:48:21,490
I got Mirage.

5185
02:48:22,290 --> 02:48:23,230
Does anyone have light ammo?

5186
02:48:23,770 --> 02:48:24,290
No, I don't.

5187
02:48:24,310 --> 02:48:25,010
I can't spare anyone.

5188
02:48:25,170 --> 02:48:25,390
I do.

5189
02:48:25,430 --> 02:48:25,590
I do.

5190
02:48:25,630 --> 02:48:26,230
I'm going to use it.

5191
02:48:26,950 --> 02:48:27,190
Ramp.

5192
02:48:27,950 --> 02:48:28,190
Ramp.

5193
02:48:28,190 --> 02:48:28,350
Ramp.

5194
02:48:28,370 --> 02:48:29,050
They're shooting ramp.

5195
02:48:29,670 --> 02:48:30,050
Yeah, yeah.

5196
02:48:30,770 --> 02:48:31,490
Keep walking up slow.

5197
02:48:31,550 --> 02:48:31,750
We're good.

5198
02:48:32,130 --> 02:48:32,670
Keep shooting ramp.

5199
02:48:32,710 --> 02:48:33,390
Just keep shooting ramp if you can.

5200
02:48:34,370 --> 02:48:34,830
Shooting ramp.

5201
02:48:35,530 --> 02:48:36,470
Yeah, just keep looking left side.

5202
02:48:36,530 --> 02:48:36,770
We're good.

5203
02:48:36,890 --> 02:48:37,370
Just keep looking.

5204
02:48:40,050 --> 02:48:40,630
Nice job, Ducky.

5205
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:40,970
You're doing great.

5206
02:48:41,290 --> 02:48:42,030
We're going to move in slowly.

5207
02:48:42,210 --> 02:48:43,050
Alright, we're going to walk up a little bit.

5208
02:48:43,110 --> 02:48:43,330
Come to me.

5209
02:48:43,350 --> 02:48:43,570
Come to me.

5210
02:48:43,570 --> 02:48:43,790
Come to me.

5211
02:48:43,970 --> 02:48:44,430
Take space.

5212
02:48:44,550 --> 02:48:44,770
Take space.

5213
02:48:44,890 --> 02:48:45,110
Come here.

5214
02:48:45,150 --> 02:48:45,310
Come here.

5215
02:48:45,310 --> 02:48:45,470
Come here.

5216
02:48:45,470 --> 02:48:45,610
Come here.

5217
02:48:47,370 --> 02:48:48,710
There's a team right below us.

5218
02:48:49,390 --> 02:48:50,090
They're going to fight each other.

5219
02:48:50,170 --> 02:48:50,370
That's good.

5220
02:48:50,490 --> 02:48:50,970
Come to me.

5221
02:48:51,010 --> 02:48:51,270
Come to me.

5222
02:48:51,350 --> 02:48:51,550
I'm here.

5223
02:48:53,070 --> 02:48:54,390
Temba, put Q's over here on the wall.

5224
02:48:58,230 --> 02:48:58,710
Below me.

5225
02:48:58,750 --> 02:48:59,070
Below me.

5226
02:48:59,070 --> 02:48:59,410
Below me.

5227
02:48:59,550 --> 02:49:00,170
Yeah, shoot left.

5228
02:49:00,210 --> 02:49:00,570
Shoot left.

5229
02:49:00,570 --> 02:49:00,950
Shoot left.

5230
02:49:04,610 --> 02:49:05,570
Right behind us.

5231
02:49:05,590 --> 02:49:06,150
There's a Mirage.

5232
02:49:06,230 --> 02:49:06,430
There's a Mirage.

5233
02:49:06,550 --> 02:49:06,730
Two.

5234
02:49:06,790 --> 02:49:06,910
Two.

5235
02:49:06,910 --> 02:49:06,990
Two.

5236
02:49:06,990 --> 02:49:07,050
Two.

5237
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:08,730
Crouch.

5238
02:49:08,730 --> 02:49:08,930
Crouch.

5239
02:49:09,090 --> 02:49:09,090
Crouch.

5240
02:49:10,290 --> 02:49:10,810
Temba, no!

5241
02:49:12,250 --> 02:49:12,850
You got this, buddy.

5242
02:49:12,910 --> 02:49:13,410
Jump down if you need.

5243
02:49:15,190 --> 02:49:15,950
I'm a tree.

5244
02:49:16,850 --> 02:49:17,390
You're a tree.

5245
02:49:17,710 --> 02:49:18,230
You're a tree.

5246
02:49:18,730 --> 02:49:19,610
I don't move.

5247
02:49:19,710 --> 02:49:21,350
Oh, it's just a duo behind us, man.

5248
02:49:22,990 --> 02:49:24,150
They came out of nowhere.

5249
02:49:24,290 --> 02:49:25,710
The Valk is right in front of me.

5250
02:49:25,770 --> 02:49:26,550
He doesn't see me.

5251
02:49:27,350 --> 02:49:28,350
Pretend you don't exist.

5252
02:49:29,250 --> 02:49:29,870
It's okay.

5253
02:49:30,010 --> 02:49:30,370
You're doing great.

5254
02:49:30,450 --> 02:49:31,290
You're doing great.

5255
02:49:31,490 --> 02:49:31,950
Don't heal anything.

5256
02:49:32,270 --> 02:49:33,050
Don't do anything.

5257
02:49:33,050 --> 02:49:33,670
Don't shoot me, guys.

5258
02:49:33,750 --> 02:49:34,930
Do not do anything.

5259
02:49:35,790 --> 02:49:37,130
Do not do anything.

5260
02:49:37,250 --> 02:49:38,470
They're tunnel visioning right now.

5261
02:49:38,570 --> 02:49:38,750
Top 10.

5262
02:49:38,850 --> 02:49:40,210
Top 10.

5263
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:40,650
Top 10.

5264
02:49:40,890 --> 02:49:41,370
Good job.

5265
02:49:41,490 --> 02:49:41,790
Nice.

5266
02:49:41,790 --> 02:49:42,310
We got top 10.

5267
02:49:42,310 --> 02:49:42,710
We got one kill.

5268
02:49:42,710 --> 02:49:43,050
Top 10.

5269
02:49:43,090 --> 02:49:43,290
Nice job.

5270
02:49:44,950 --> 02:49:45,770
God damn it.

5271
02:49:46,310 --> 02:49:47,570
Oh, my God.

5272
02:49:47,750 --> 02:49:48,690
They actually...

5273
02:49:48,690 --> 02:49:50,170
We got top 10.

5274
02:49:51,330 --> 02:49:52,150
We'll take it.

5275
02:49:52,210 --> 02:49:53,910
We got top 10 and a kill.

5276
02:49:54,030 --> 02:49:54,650
That's fine.

5277
02:49:55,930 --> 02:49:57,130
I got to pee again.

5278
02:49:57,910 --> 02:49:58,390
What?

5279
02:49:59,090 --> 02:49:59,810
You got what?

5280
02:50:00,150 --> 02:50:01,330
He has to urinate again.

5281
02:50:03,130 --> 02:50:03,610
What?

5282
02:50:03,930 --> 02:50:04,970
He has to pee again.

5283
02:50:05,970 --> 02:50:07,790
Temba, what the fuck is wrong with you?

5284
02:50:07,810 --> 02:50:09,350
I have no idea.

5285
02:50:09,650 --> 02:50:11,570
I don't think that's healthy.

5286
02:50:12,230 --> 02:50:13,210
No, it's not 100%.

5287
02:50:13,210 --> 02:50:14,730
That is 100% not healthy.

5288
02:50:14,830 --> 02:50:18,010
You're peeing like every 15 minutes.

5289
02:50:18,510 --> 02:50:19,090
I agree.

5290
02:50:19,090 --> 02:50:19,290
I agree fully.

5291
02:50:19,630 --> 02:50:20,630
Dude, nice job, though.

5292
02:50:20,670 --> 02:50:21,170
We did a good job.

5293
02:50:22,270 --> 02:50:22,950
Really well played.

5294
02:50:23,010 --> 02:50:23,730
We just killed that duo.

5295
02:50:23,770 --> 02:50:25,030
We could actually be alive right now, which sucks.

5296
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:27,050
They just came out of nowhere.

5297
02:50:27,250 --> 02:50:28,750
I thought they were not rotating to us.

5298
02:50:29,030 --> 02:50:30,150
I don't know why they did that.

5299
02:50:30,510 --> 02:50:31,590
I thought they were going inside.

5300
02:50:32,470 --> 02:50:32,830
Same.

5301
02:50:32,990 --> 02:50:33,170
Same.

5302
02:50:33,510 --> 02:50:34,870
It worked out, but it is what it is.

5303
02:50:37,230 --> 02:50:39,350
Temba definitely has a bladder problem right now.

5304
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:40,510
Oh, for sure.

5305
02:50:42,070 --> 02:50:43,550
How is he nervous?

5306
02:50:43,850 --> 02:50:44,950
How is he nervous?

5307
02:50:47,070 --> 02:50:49,970
Honestly, why the fuck is he nervous?

5308
02:50:50,210 --> 02:50:50,270
Yeah.

5309
02:50:51,490 --> 02:50:53,130
How the fuck is he nervous?

5310
02:50:53,270 --> 02:50:55,690
He's the diamond three in the game.

5311
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:57,050
That's what I'm saying.

5312
02:50:58,810 --> 02:50:59,470
It's okay.

5313
02:51:00,170 --> 02:51:01,490
As long as...

5314
02:51:02,150 --> 02:51:02,790
It's okay.

5315
02:51:02,910 --> 02:51:04,990
We got top ten plus one point.

5316
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:08,190
As long as Greek got not top ten plus one, I'm so happy.

5317
02:51:08,270 --> 02:51:08,730
Yeah, yeah.

5318
02:51:08,750 --> 02:51:10,190
That's all we have to worry about.

5319
02:51:11,570 --> 02:51:12,090
We need them.

5320
02:51:12,930 --> 02:51:13,890
That's all I care about.

5321
02:51:14,150 --> 02:51:15,430
We got the vibes.

5322
02:51:16,010 --> 02:51:17,270
That's all we need.

5323
02:51:17,390 --> 02:51:17,950
The vibes.

5324
02:51:19,410 --> 02:51:19,790
Wow.

5325
02:51:19,970 --> 02:51:21,090
Let's see this play for the Wraith.

5326
02:51:21,230 --> 02:51:22,930
Yeah, I'm checking the Wraith play right now.

5327
02:51:23,030 --> 02:51:23,190
Oh, wait.

5328
02:51:23,230 --> 02:51:23,690
Did he kidnap?

5329
02:51:24,130 --> 02:51:24,750
He tried.

5330
02:51:25,990 --> 02:51:27,050
No, he did.

5331
02:51:27,270 --> 02:51:28,170
No, he did not.

5332
02:51:29,770 --> 02:51:31,530
That would have been so fucking funny.

5333
02:51:31,710 --> 02:51:33,010
That would have been so nice if he did that.

5334
02:51:33,010 --> 02:51:34,070
Look at all the rats out here, man.

5335
02:51:34,350 --> 02:51:35,330
So many rats.

5336
02:51:35,590 --> 02:51:36,090
Oh, my God.

5337
02:51:36,130 --> 02:51:36,870
Look at all these rats.

5338
02:51:37,190 --> 02:51:38,150
That could have been Temba.

5339
02:51:38,710 --> 02:51:40,670
That could have been Temba.

5340
02:51:41,430 --> 02:51:41,790
What?

5341
02:51:42,370 --> 02:51:43,630
I can't believe you got seen.

5342
02:51:44,670 --> 02:51:45,250
I know.

5343
02:51:45,330 --> 02:51:46,410
I can't believe they saw you.

5344
02:51:46,970 --> 02:51:48,010
You could have been free.

5345
02:51:48,670 --> 02:51:49,510
Yeah, I'm lowkey surprised.

5346
02:51:50,410 --> 02:51:50,990
Me too.

5347
02:51:51,170 --> 02:51:53,430
They should have been so distracted with the people above me.

5348
02:51:53,890 --> 02:51:55,350
Honestly, Temba, did you have cat wall there?

5349
02:51:56,130 --> 02:51:56,490
Yes.

5350
02:51:57,150 --> 02:51:58,830
We should have cat walled ourselves, to be honest.

5351
02:52:00,310 --> 02:52:03,510
We go to that pillar and we just cat wall off the other side.

5352
02:52:04,610 --> 02:52:05,230
That's my bad.

5353
02:52:05,290 --> 02:52:05,830
I should have told you that.

5354
02:52:05,830 --> 02:52:06,690
I forgot we were playing cat.

5355
02:52:06,930 --> 02:52:09,450
We didn't use any of our ults, except for that one bell.

5356
02:52:10,210 --> 02:52:10,870
Yeah, I guess.

5357
02:52:10,970 --> 02:52:13,470
I got shot so fast, I couldn't even ult.

5358
02:52:13,670 --> 02:52:14,930
No, that's not your fault.

5359
02:52:15,250 --> 02:52:15,890
That's my bad.

5360
02:52:15,990 --> 02:52:19,610
I should have told 100% Temba to cat wall us off, so teams can't push us.

5361
02:52:19,730 --> 02:52:21,530
Yeah, cat wall behind us.

5362
02:52:21,650 --> 02:52:21,790
Yeah.

5363
02:52:22,730 --> 02:52:23,090
Exactly.

5364
02:52:24,550 --> 02:52:25,050
It's okay.

5365
02:52:25,650 --> 02:52:26,470
The next game.

5366
02:52:26,590 --> 02:52:27,070
Now we know.

5367
02:52:27,110 --> 02:52:27,630
Three points?

5368
02:52:27,650 --> 02:52:27,890
Wait.

5369
02:52:28,270 --> 02:52:29,110
Did we get a kill?

5370
02:52:29,430 --> 02:52:30,250
Yeah, we got one kill.

5371
02:52:30,930 --> 02:52:32,210
I got to kill the Lombo.

5372
02:52:32,910 --> 02:52:33,270
Nice.

5373
02:52:33,270 --> 02:52:33,750
Yeah, yeah.

5374
02:52:35,830 --> 02:52:39,590
First game, Temple hasn't got a big kill for more subs.

5375
02:52:40,330 --> 02:52:41,690
That poor Valk.

5376
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:42,430
What the fuck?

5377
02:52:46,030 --> 02:52:46,970
There's no way.

5378
02:52:48,030 --> 02:52:48,850
He tried.

5379
02:52:49,390 --> 02:52:50,990
That Valk definitely tried.

5380
02:52:51,350 --> 02:52:52,230
They did their best.

5381
02:52:53,470 --> 02:52:54,210
Hey, listen.

5382
02:52:54,430 --> 02:52:55,690
10th place, one kill.

5383
02:52:55,790 --> 02:52:56,190
Not awful.

5384
02:52:56,450 --> 02:52:57,210
Yeah, yeah.

5385
02:52:57,950 --> 02:52:59,130
It's pretty decent.

5386
02:52:59,670 --> 02:53:01,010
Pretty fucking decent, guys.

5387
02:53:01,590 --> 02:53:03,770
It means we're better than Greek.

5388
02:53:03,930 --> 02:53:04,910
Okay, let's check Greek score.

5389
02:53:05,830 --> 02:53:06,550
I think you just won.

5390
02:53:06,630 --> 02:53:06,870
Imagine.

5391
02:53:07,570 --> 02:53:07,930
No.

5392
02:53:09,290 --> 02:53:09,930
Don't say that.

5393
02:53:10,030 --> 02:53:10,390
Don't say that.

5394
02:53:11,190 --> 02:53:12,230
Oh, no, no.

5395
02:53:12,790 --> 02:53:15,690
No, we needed him to not win a game.

5396
02:53:16,670 --> 02:53:17,010
Please, no.

5397
02:53:17,070 --> 02:53:17,470
Please, no.

5398
02:53:17,770 --> 02:53:18,310
Please, no.

5399
02:53:19,790 --> 02:53:21,490
Oh, no.

5400
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:22,630
Okay, it's we the people.

5401
02:53:22,710 --> 02:53:23,130
It's not Greek.

5402
02:53:23,270 --> 02:53:23,750
Okay, nice.

5403
02:53:23,890 --> 02:53:24,070
Okay.

5404
02:53:24,270 --> 02:53:26,510
Oh, no.

5405
02:53:26,970 --> 02:53:27,490
Damn it.

5406
02:53:27,810 --> 02:53:28,350
Oh, no.

5407
02:53:28,470 --> 02:53:28,910
Oh, no.

5408
02:53:30,910 --> 02:53:31,750
Wait, wait.

5409
02:53:31,790 --> 02:53:32,310
Where's Greek?

5410
02:53:32,610 --> 02:53:33,150
Greek's 14.

5411
02:53:33,150 --> 02:53:34,050
Where's 14?

5412
02:53:34,930 --> 02:53:36,410
He got zero kills.

5413
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:37,630
14th place.

5414
02:53:38,530 --> 02:53:39,410
Zero points.

5415
02:53:40,010 --> 02:53:40,450
We're at six.

5416
02:53:40,730 --> 02:53:41,370
We're at 11.

5417
02:53:42,730 --> 02:53:43,490
Where's Gent?

5418
02:53:43,930 --> 02:53:45,130
Greek's team at zero points.

5419
02:53:45,310 --> 02:53:45,810
We're still fine.

5420
02:53:46,350 --> 02:53:47,670
Yeah, Gent's team's six.

5421
02:53:47,770 --> 02:53:49,010
He got ninth with two.

5422
02:53:49,230 --> 02:53:50,290
A little better than us.

5423
02:53:50,630 --> 02:53:51,550
Is he gonna pass us?

5424
02:53:52,050 --> 02:53:52,590
No, no.

5425
02:53:52,630 --> 02:53:54,530
He was already past us, but we were gonna...

5426
02:53:54,530 --> 02:53:55,490
Ninth with two?

5427
02:53:56,090 --> 02:53:58,070
Okay, so we're only three points away from Gent.

5428
02:53:58,170 --> 02:53:58,870
We're at 19.

5429
02:53:59,650 --> 02:54:00,170
It's okay.

5430
02:54:00,450 --> 02:54:01,170
We're not...

5431
02:54:01,950 --> 02:54:06,130
Greek just needs a really, really good game to...

5432
02:54:06,130 --> 02:54:07,030
Reptile and Greek?

5433
02:54:07,230 --> 02:54:07,450
Okay.

5434
02:54:07,550 --> 02:54:08,770
We just need to beat your roommate.

5435
02:54:09,290 --> 02:54:10,150
That's all I want, bro.

5436
02:54:10,710 --> 02:54:12,130
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

5437
02:54:12,250 --> 02:54:12,790
I'll be right back.

5438
02:54:13,130 --> 02:54:13,510
You're good.

5439
02:54:13,630 --> 02:54:14,550
That's all I want, bro.

5440
02:54:15,070 --> 02:54:15,790
That's all I need.

5441
02:54:15,850 --> 02:54:17,250
Okay, hopefully these next lessons are good for us.

5442
02:54:18,350 --> 02:54:20,270
We definitely don't need support, to be honest.

5443
02:54:20,310 --> 02:54:22,110
We haven't used it once, to be fair.

5444
02:54:22,170 --> 02:54:26,630
Yeah, I'm gonna go Fuse if she wants the controller.

5445
02:54:27,070 --> 02:54:27,670
Yeah, we'll see.

5446
02:54:27,810 --> 02:54:28,110
We'll see what happens.

5447
02:54:30,250 --> 02:54:31,750
I think the next one's, like, pretty weird.

5448
02:54:31,830 --> 02:54:32,570
I think it's, uh...

5449
02:54:32,570 --> 02:54:32,990
Let me see.

5450
02:54:33,050 --> 02:54:33,890
I know they put it there.

5451
02:54:34,150 --> 02:54:35,170
I think it's...

5452
02:54:36,090 --> 02:54:38,190
Oh, they're typing it right now.

5453
02:54:38,230 --> 02:54:38,450
Let's wait.

5454
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:41,070
It's, like, six Skirmisher or some shit like that.

5455
02:54:41,130 --> 02:54:42,050
It's, like, majority of Skirmish.

5456
02:54:42,370 --> 02:54:42,990
I think it was.

5457
02:54:43,090 --> 02:54:44,130
Wait, which was Skirmisher?

5458
02:54:47,530 --> 02:54:48,090
Six Assault.

5459
02:54:49,830 --> 02:54:50,910
It's six Assault this time around?

5460
02:54:51,590 --> 02:54:52,250
I have no idea.

5461
02:54:52,290 --> 02:54:52,990
I was just making it up.

5462
02:54:53,270 --> 02:54:53,550
Oh.

5463
02:54:53,970 --> 02:54:54,750
What did Clara say?

5464
02:54:59,200 --> 02:54:59,760
Can y'all...

5465
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:00,500
Okay, yes.

5466
02:55:01,560 --> 02:55:02,160
Who is it?

5467
02:55:02,220 --> 02:55:02,440
Who is it?

5468
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:05,200
Assault controller support.

5469
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:10,500
Okay, so we have Ash, MadMaggie, Ballistic, Watson, Rampart, Loba, Mirage, Conduit.

5470
02:55:10,740 --> 02:55:11,540
Holy fuck.

5471
02:55:12,460 --> 02:55:12,820
Um...

5472
02:55:12,820 --> 02:55:15,060
My god, they really saved the worst for last.

5473
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:15,520
I like that.

5474
02:55:16,120 --> 02:55:16,480
Uh...

5475
02:55:16,480 --> 02:55:17,600
Alright, so who are you gonna play?

5476
02:55:17,860 --> 02:55:18,520
I'm Fused.

5477
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:20,680
Oh, there's Fused.

5478
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:21,040
Okay, good.

5479
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:23,520
Who is she gonna play?

5480
02:55:23,700 --> 02:55:24,020
I'm back.

5481
02:55:24,360 --> 02:55:24,720
Wait.

5482
02:55:24,920 --> 02:55:27,940
Wait, what's the... what's the thing?

5483
02:55:28,900 --> 02:55:29,340
Mirage...

5484
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:29,820
It's Ash, MadMaggie.

5485
02:55:30,140 --> 02:55:32,420
Oh, I can do Conduit.

5486
02:55:33,100 --> 02:55:33,800
Alright, I'm down.

5487
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:34,480
Oh, that sounds great.

5488
02:55:34,520 --> 02:55:34,900
Okay, cool.

5489
02:55:34,940 --> 02:55:37,540
And maybe I'll just do Ash for the TP.

5490
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:38,440
Yeah.

5491
02:55:38,940 --> 02:55:39,520
Alright, cool.

5492
02:55:39,660 --> 02:55:41,700
Yeah, so we got Ash...

5493
02:55:41,700 --> 02:55:45,980
Is Temple gonna play Watson or Rampart?

5494
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:47,240
Oh, actually, yeah.

5495
02:55:47,300 --> 02:55:47,820
I can play Watson.

5496
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:48,940
Yeah, play Watson, Temple.

5497
02:55:48,940 --> 02:55:50,760
Yeah, this is the last game.

5498
02:55:50,860 --> 02:55:57,220
As long as Grieg dies before us, then we've, like, established that we're better than Grieg's team.

5499
02:55:57,940 --> 02:56:00,300
Grieg, you gotta go out last, man.

5500
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:01,740
No, do you know what's even...

5501
02:56:01,740 --> 02:56:02,360
I can't go out last.

5502
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:07,240
We have no pro player on our team, but we're still above a pro player team.

5503
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:09,060
Yeah, true.

5504
02:56:09,320 --> 02:56:10,380
If you think about it that way.

5505
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:11,600
Now you're spinning.

5506
02:56:13,660 --> 02:56:15,660
We literally have...

5507
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:18,000
Why are you a genius, Tom?

5508
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:22,700
We basically won.

5509
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:26,500
Any team that's below us is embarrassing.

5510
02:56:27,940 --> 02:56:29,500
Alright, let's pass a few more, then.

5511
02:56:29,600 --> 02:56:30,100
That is fucking for sure.

5512
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:33,160
That is fucking for sure.

5513
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:36,060
And it's gonna be one team, which is Grieg's.

5514
02:56:36,220 --> 02:56:37,840
Yeah, it's gonna be one team.

5515
02:56:38,140 --> 02:56:40,280
Is it funnier if it's just one team?

5516
02:56:40,600 --> 02:56:42,880
And, by the way, Inruptor had first pick.

5517
02:56:43,240 --> 02:56:44,740
Inruptor had first pick.

5518
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:45,500
True.

5519
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:49,300
I'm gonna be regretting that Grieg decision right now.

5520
02:56:51,320 --> 02:56:53,980
Alright, we'll see what happens, dude.

5521
02:56:54,140 --> 02:56:57,740
Alright, so I'm gonna go Ash, then you go Wattson, then you go Konduit.

5522
02:56:57,840 --> 02:56:58,880
Yeah, yeah, I go Konduit.

5523
02:56:59,280 --> 02:57:01,740
This is our sweatiest comp so far.

5524
02:57:01,900 --> 02:57:04,060
This is our actual real comp so far.

5525
02:57:05,080 --> 02:57:06,940
It's like the only real one that makes sense.

5526
02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:11,000
Alright.

5527
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:11,780
I swapped.

5528
02:57:13,720 --> 02:57:14,640
I'm back in.

5529
02:57:16,180 --> 02:57:17,680
Oh my god, this is it.

5530
02:57:21,780 --> 02:57:22,660
We're gonna...

5531
02:57:24,500 --> 02:57:25,600
My goal is...

5532
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:28,540
As long as we're above Grieg's team, that's all I want.

5533
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:31,000
That's all I want.

5534
02:57:31,240 --> 02:57:32,100
That's really all we want right now.

5535
02:57:32,120 --> 02:57:32,820
Yeah, yeah.

5536
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:34,920
Yeah, warm-up's done, guys.

5537
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:35,400
Yeah.

5538
02:57:38,420 --> 02:57:39,440
That's all we need.

5539
02:57:39,560 --> 02:57:45,000
If Peep can go from 19th to a win with 8, Yeah.

5540
02:57:46,040 --> 02:57:47,380
We should be able to do that.

5541
02:57:47,580 --> 02:57:48,960
Okay, but the thing is...

5542
02:57:50,220 --> 02:57:59,020
The thing that separates us from Peep is that all three of us are plat rank right now.

5543
02:58:00,260 --> 02:58:00,900
Wait...

5544
02:58:02,340 --> 02:58:02,980
Plat?

5545
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:04,300
Diamond?

5546
02:58:05,980 --> 02:58:06,840
He's pred.

5547
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:11,800
Yeah, so like, I don't know.

5548
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:14,600
We're sort of like...

5549
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:15,740
You know...

5550
02:58:15,740 --> 02:58:16,940
We got this.

5551
02:58:17,100 --> 02:58:19,020
Our team has to be like...

5552
02:58:19,020 --> 02:58:22,180
We're definitely the team of the people.

5553
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:24,580
Yeah, we're the people's squad.

5554
02:58:24,980 --> 02:58:27,860
The amount of copium we're on right now is unreal.

5555
02:58:28,860 --> 02:58:30,780
We're the vibe team, guys.

5556
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:32,940
We're the team that everyone likes, dude.

5557
02:58:33,020 --> 02:58:33,600
We are!

5558
02:58:33,860 --> 02:58:35,500
We can be multiple things!

5559
02:58:36,760 --> 02:58:38,120
Just not good?

5560
02:58:39,800 --> 02:58:41,240
Everything but good?

5561
02:58:42,800 --> 02:58:46,280
Can you really say that we're a good team with a straight face?

5562
02:58:46,680 --> 02:58:47,080
Yeah.

5563
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,340
Only you can, Temple.

5564
02:58:49,420 --> 02:58:50,400
You're the only one.

5565
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:52,520
He's the only one that has like...

5566
02:58:52,520 --> 02:58:54,280
is like, actually delusional.

5567
02:58:54,460 --> 02:58:55,260
He's the only one.

5568
02:58:56,120 --> 02:58:57,000
I like it, though.

5569
02:58:57,640 --> 02:58:58,740
We need that, though.

5570
02:58:58,840 --> 02:59:01,560
We need somebody that's not in reality.

5571
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:03,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5572
02:59:05,060 --> 02:59:05,740
Okay, well...

5573
02:59:07,420 --> 02:59:08,940
Alright, this is our sweetest comp, bro.

5574
02:59:08,940 --> 02:59:09,340
We win this one.

5575
02:59:09,460 --> 02:59:09,900
There's no way.

5576
02:59:11,080 --> 02:59:12,440
We warmed up for like...

5577
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:13,660
It doesn't matter.

5578
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:14,180
It's the last one.

5579
02:59:14,280 --> 02:59:14,580
We got this.

5580
02:59:16,780 --> 02:59:19,020
Petition to play another Storm Point over Olympus.

5581
02:59:20,400 --> 02:59:22,000
Lowkey down for that.

5582
02:59:22,200 --> 02:59:23,340
To be honest.

5583
02:59:28,360 --> 02:59:29,900
Petition to reset score.

5584
02:59:30,640 --> 02:59:31,840
Oh my god!

5585
02:59:31,940 --> 02:59:32,540
So real?

5586
02:59:34,040 --> 02:59:35,460
No, we play Olympus?

5587
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:43,520
We're definitely a team.

5588
02:59:43,860 --> 02:59:44,440
I know.

5589
02:59:44,580 --> 02:59:45,960
We're a team.

5590
02:59:46,540 --> 02:59:47,220
We're...

5591
02:59:48,260 --> 02:59:49,560
EA team.

5592
02:59:50,240 --> 02:59:50,920
We're...

5593
02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:53,240
We own Twitch.

5594
02:59:58,960 --> 03:00:01,280
All I'm saying is that...

5595
03:00:01,280 --> 03:00:08,220
Wig, I don't know why, but when you're headlining your Twitch rivals, it really...

5596
03:00:08,220 --> 03:00:09,560
Everything goes against you.

5597
03:00:11,400 --> 03:00:12,460
Not everything.

5598
03:00:12,700 --> 03:00:13,260
Not yet.

5599
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:14,600
Not everything, though.

5600
03:00:16,180 --> 03:00:17,420
It's not about winning.

5601
03:00:18,660 --> 03:00:20,080
It's really about the friends when you win.

5602
03:00:21,860 --> 03:00:26,440
Why did you argue about me about that before when I said it wasn't about winning?

5603
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:29,780
I'm trying to be positive now.

5604
03:00:29,960 --> 03:00:32,420
I've been pointing my motivations all the way through the floor.

5605
03:00:32,840 --> 03:00:35,780
So now it's not about winning.

5606
03:00:35,780 --> 03:00:36,680
No, of course.

5607
03:00:36,780 --> 03:00:39,900
Now it's not about winning.

5608
03:00:39,900 --> 03:00:40,240
Alright.

5609
03:00:41,300 --> 03:00:41,820
Exactly.

5610
03:00:44,240 --> 03:00:46,800
Well, we're up good and we haven't started yet.

5611
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:47,400
Of course it's about winning.

5612
03:00:47,400 --> 03:00:48,980
When we start doing bad, then it's all about the friends.

5613
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:50,780
I can't believe our first game was our peak.

5614
03:00:51,060 --> 03:00:53,660
That was actually the game where we had the most kills.

5615
03:00:53,860 --> 03:00:54,740
We have 11 points.

5616
03:00:55,660 --> 03:00:56,240
Pretty good.

5617
03:00:56,320 --> 03:00:58,200
Just need 7 or 8.

5618
03:00:59,100 --> 03:01:00,240
That's a lot of points.

5619
03:01:00,380 --> 03:01:01,780
8 points to get out of bottom 5.

5620
03:01:02,220 --> 03:01:05,920
We got 11 points just from 5 games.

5621
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:06,480
I don't know.

5622
03:01:06,540 --> 03:01:08,320
8 points seems like a 5 game scenario.

5623
03:01:13,700 --> 03:01:14,680
You know what?

5624
03:01:14,700 --> 03:01:15,600
Wait, are we leaving...

5625
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:17,140
letting Tempo roam free again?

5626
03:01:18,340 --> 03:01:19,380
Wait, where are we?

5627
03:01:19,440 --> 03:01:20,160
No, I can't.

5628
03:01:20,200 --> 03:01:22,020
There's no place to roam to.

5629
03:01:22,140 --> 03:01:23,420
We're in Turbine.

5630
03:01:23,780 --> 03:01:24,980
Yeah, but like...

5631
03:01:25,880 --> 03:01:28,400
If you survive as a solo...

5632
03:01:28,400 --> 03:01:30,320
If we're in Turbine, I can land Waterfall.

5633
03:01:31,220 --> 03:01:31,540
Yeah.

5634
03:01:32,340 --> 03:01:33,940
Yeah, we should let him roam free.

5635
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:36,100
Wait, should we do it?

5636
03:01:37,860 --> 03:01:38,300
Why?

5637
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:40,700
Let Tempo roam free again.

5638
03:01:40,820 --> 03:01:41,440
For the last game.

5639
03:01:41,800 --> 03:01:42,540
I'm so down.

5640
03:01:42,820 --> 03:01:45,340
Actually, Tempo, don't even come back to us.

5641
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:46,600
What's the...

5642
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:47,740
What's the...

5643
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:51,200
What's the butthole POI?

5644
03:01:51,360 --> 03:01:52,920
The butthole POI?

5645
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:53,840
The Turbine?

5646
03:01:54,240 --> 03:01:55,340
Oh, oh, oh.

5647
03:01:55,380 --> 03:01:56,380
Oh, fuck.

5648
03:01:56,660 --> 03:01:56,860
Rift?

5649
03:01:57,060 --> 03:02:01,000
The giant thick thingy.

5650
03:02:01,020 --> 03:02:01,320
What?

5651
03:02:02,240 --> 03:02:04,300
Bro, Tempo, you organized scrims.

5652
03:02:04,360 --> 03:02:04,800
Hammond.

5653
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:06,660
Hammond.

5654
03:02:06,820 --> 03:02:07,380
Hammond?

5655
03:02:08,320 --> 03:02:10,660
It has a giant thingy that you can go in.

5656
03:02:11,820 --> 03:02:15,840
Okay, do we let Tempo roam free and not come back to us?

5657
03:02:16,040 --> 03:02:17,400
And then he can try and solo rat.

5658
03:02:18,080 --> 03:02:19,940
Yeah, I gotta go find a beacon.

5659
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:20,820
Yeah.

5660
03:02:21,900 --> 03:02:22,860
I'm so down.

5661
03:02:24,220 --> 03:02:26,120
Okay, Tempo, don't come back to us.

5662
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:28,340
Do you get a beacon in Turbine?

5663
03:02:28,800 --> 03:02:29,200
No.

5664
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:30,240
I don't think so.

5665
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:33,580
I'm gonna go steal Hammond.

5666
03:02:34,800 --> 03:02:36,120
Okay, this is it.

5667
03:02:36,740 --> 03:02:37,680
This is the game.

5668
03:02:37,780 --> 03:02:39,580
This is the game where we get 10 points.

5669
03:02:39,740 --> 03:02:44,100
This is the game where Tempo will rat until second place or some shit.

5670
03:02:44,400 --> 03:02:45,540
Yeah, that's double our points then.

5671
03:02:47,540 --> 03:02:49,340
Well, I should pick a small person.

5672
03:02:50,260 --> 03:02:52,600
We already established our characters.

5673
03:02:52,820 --> 03:02:54,620
What do you mean you should pick a small person?

5674
03:02:55,120 --> 03:02:55,620
Fuck me the fucking.

5675
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:56,040
Let's do it.

5676
03:02:56,040 --> 03:02:56,460
No, we got this.

5677
03:02:56,620 --> 03:02:57,200
I'm Ash.

5678
03:02:57,360 --> 03:02:58,180
Yeah, you're Ash.

5679
03:02:58,320 --> 03:02:59,100
I am Conduit.

5680
03:02:59,160 --> 03:03:00,400
And Tempo is...

5681
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:03,480
We just gotta trick someone into picking a character that's not there.

5682
03:03:03,480 --> 03:03:04,540
And then they get minus five.

5683
03:03:04,900 --> 03:03:06,300
Yeah, but they're gonna restart the game.

5684
03:03:07,160 --> 03:03:07,520
True.

5685
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:09,200
Minus five.

5686
03:03:09,660 --> 03:03:12,540
They're just gonna restart the game unless they are stubborn enough.

5687
03:03:14,060 --> 03:03:14,940
Oh, there we go.

5688
03:03:15,220 --> 03:03:15,840
Give me Ash.

5689
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:16,820
Give me Ash.

5690
03:03:16,900 --> 03:03:17,320
Oh, fuck.

5691
03:03:17,480 --> 03:03:18,200
I just broke my controller.

5692
03:03:18,360 --> 03:03:18,520
We're good.

5693
03:03:19,200 --> 03:03:20,080
Give me Ash.

5694
03:03:20,360 --> 03:03:21,080
I'm locked in.

5695
03:03:21,140 --> 03:03:21,940
I'm so locked in right now.

5696
03:03:21,940 --> 03:03:22,540
We're so locked in.

5697
03:03:22,540 --> 03:03:22,820
We're here.

5698
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:23,380
We're ready.

5699
03:03:24,780 --> 03:03:26,560
Alright, my face is in my screen.

5700
03:03:27,140 --> 03:03:28,080
Oh, hell yeah, baby.

5701
03:03:28,240 --> 03:03:29,500
I wish I was your screen right now.

5702
03:03:29,620 --> 03:03:30,060
Let's go.

5703
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:34,540
Bro, what?

5704
03:03:35,240 --> 03:03:36,500
Can you repeat that way?

5705
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:42,060
Alright, here we go.

5706
03:03:42,180 --> 03:03:43,600
Do we have anything in Turbine?

5707
03:03:44,020 --> 03:03:45,920
We have nothing in Turbine.

5708
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:46,260
Let's go.

5709
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,840
We have a ring console for Tempo to scan.

5710
03:03:51,340 --> 03:03:52,420
Oh, we're so fucked.

5711
03:03:52,460 --> 03:03:52,600
We do?

5712
03:03:53,280 --> 03:03:54,160
We don't.

5713
03:03:54,780 --> 03:03:56,440
Yeah, yeah.

5714
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:57,460
You're gonna go to Hammond.

5715
03:03:57,460 --> 03:03:59,600
I gotta wait for the team to land in Hammond.

5716
03:03:59,700 --> 03:04:01,080
And then I gotta steal their top loot.

5717
03:04:01,360 --> 03:04:02,800
Someone's actually taking Hammond?

5718
03:04:02,880 --> 03:04:03,020
God.

5719
03:04:03,480 --> 03:04:04,520
I'm gonna be worse than us, guys.

5720
03:04:06,740 --> 03:04:07,620
I don't know.

5721
03:04:07,940 --> 03:04:09,860
Is that person landing top Hammond?

5722
03:04:10,360 --> 03:04:11,940
Hey, why are you still with us, Tempo?

5723
03:04:13,660 --> 03:04:15,160
I forgot about the Shrath.

5724
03:04:15,280 --> 03:04:15,940
30 seconds.

5725
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:17,540
Oh, wait.

5726
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:18,400
Sorry.

5727
03:04:18,460 --> 03:04:20,020
I was watching the other team.

5728
03:04:22,440 --> 03:04:23,460
Too late now.

5729
03:04:23,660 --> 03:04:24,180
We're gone.

5730
03:04:24,460 --> 03:04:24,920
We're gone.

5731
03:04:26,180 --> 03:04:27,960
Tempo, why are you still here?

5732
03:04:29,780 --> 03:04:31,320
I came to steal your loot.

5733
03:04:31,320 --> 03:04:32,480
We literally talked about...

5734
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:33,460
Don't go anywhere now.

5735
03:04:33,580 --> 03:04:34,300
We're on your feet.

5736
03:04:34,400 --> 03:04:35,040
Just stay with us.

5737
03:04:36,220 --> 03:04:38,360
We're talking about the Shrath.

5738
03:04:39,300 --> 03:04:39,700
Together.

5739
03:04:40,040 --> 03:04:41,180
How did you forget?

5740
03:04:42,480 --> 03:04:43,080
I was...

5741
03:04:43,080 --> 03:04:43,780
I don't know.

5742
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:45,940
I love you both so much.

5743
03:04:47,140 --> 03:04:47,880
It's okay, buddy.

5744
03:04:48,560 --> 03:04:49,040
Don't worry.

5745
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:50,500
I turned around in that one endgame.

5746
03:04:51,160 --> 03:04:51,700
Don't worry.

5747
03:04:51,740 --> 03:04:53,580
We're the team of the people.

5748
03:04:53,720 --> 03:04:55,000
We're the team of the people, guys.

5749
03:04:55,100 --> 03:04:55,340
Remember.

5750
03:04:55,880 --> 03:04:58,240
This has to be fucking somewhere near us, dude.

5751
03:04:58,240 --> 03:05:00,520
Like, this needs to be near us.

5752
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:02,040
There's just no way it's not.

5753
03:05:02,160 --> 03:05:03,360
It has to be somewhere fucking close.

5754
03:05:03,540 --> 03:05:04,140
It just has to be.

5755
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:06,740
Where is a beacon that we can hit?

5756
03:05:07,120 --> 03:05:07,720
Power grid.

5757
03:05:07,900 --> 03:05:09,240
That's not good for us, actually.

5758
03:05:09,280 --> 03:05:10,220
That is not good for us.

5759
03:05:10,280 --> 03:05:11,820
We should not go there.

5760
03:05:13,440 --> 03:05:15,560
I think we take a gamble here.

5761
03:05:15,900 --> 03:05:16,260
Okay?

5762
03:05:16,360 --> 03:05:16,500
Yeah.

5763
03:05:17,320 --> 03:05:19,320
And I think we go towards docks.

5764
03:05:20,280 --> 03:05:20,640
Okay.

5765
03:05:20,640 --> 03:05:22,160
I believe in your gambles.

5766
03:05:22,640 --> 03:05:24,000
We have nothing left to lose.

5767
03:05:24,160 --> 03:05:24,980
We're literally...

5768
03:05:25,440 --> 03:05:26,860
We have nothing left to lose.

5769
03:05:26,900 --> 03:05:27,600
We have to believe.

5770
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:28,580
Oh, we do.

5771
03:05:28,660 --> 03:05:29,620
We have something to lose.

5772
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:30,180
Greek, man.

5773
03:05:31,600 --> 03:05:34,080
We have one thing specifically that we can lose.

5774
03:05:34,160 --> 03:05:35,520
We have only one thing to lose.

5775
03:05:35,540 --> 03:05:36,960
There's a charge rifle right here, Tempo.

5776
03:05:37,480 --> 03:05:38,300
I got one.

5777
03:05:40,340 --> 03:05:40,700
Nice.

5778
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:42,220
He has the one thing he needs.

5779
03:05:42,820 --> 03:05:43,760
Wasn't there a scalper somewhere?

5780
03:05:45,560 --> 03:05:47,880
I don't know where the scalper was.

5781
03:05:48,120 --> 03:05:48,860
I have no idea.

5782
03:05:49,040 --> 03:05:49,720
I haven't seen one.

5783
03:05:50,380 --> 03:05:51,480
They dropped it off my repeater.

5784
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:52,540
Where the fuck did I put my repeater?

5785
03:05:52,540 --> 03:05:53,020
Oh my god.

5786
03:05:53,020 --> 03:05:53,520
I'm a mess right now.

5787
03:05:53,940 --> 03:05:54,560
Oh no.

5788
03:05:55,020 --> 03:05:55,680
Oh no.

5789
03:05:56,020 --> 03:05:57,740
You can't be a mess right now.

5790
03:05:57,840 --> 03:05:57,960
No.

5791
03:05:58,680 --> 03:05:59,300
I'm freaking out.

5792
03:05:59,380 --> 03:05:59,700
I'm freaking out.

5793
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:00,040
I'm freaking out.

5794
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:00,760
Don't freak out.

5795
03:06:00,780 --> 03:06:01,620
There's a repeater right here.

5796
03:06:01,780 --> 03:06:03,100
It's a hammer point.

5797
03:06:03,340 --> 03:06:04,040
Oh, here.

5798
03:06:04,660 --> 03:06:05,020
Okay.

5799
03:06:05,240 --> 03:06:05,820
I found it.

5800
03:06:06,060 --> 03:06:09,140
I found it.

5801
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:09,880
Okay.

5802
03:06:09,940 --> 03:06:11,860
I'm so focused on the zone now that I just like...

5803
03:06:11,860 --> 03:06:12,400
Alright.

5804
03:06:12,560 --> 03:06:13,680
Let's go towards docks.

5805
03:06:13,800 --> 03:06:14,880
Anyone have an evac tower?

5806
03:06:15,060 --> 03:06:16,060
Any evac tower friends?

5807
03:06:16,320 --> 03:06:16,560
Nope.

5808
03:06:18,540 --> 03:06:23,000
I've only had a chance to look at one evac tower and we died really early on.

5809
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:23,780
One moment.

5810
03:06:23,880 --> 03:06:25,180
And the drop killed us.

5811
03:06:27,060 --> 03:06:27,520
Alright.

5812
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:28,380
Ready?

5813
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:29,280
Yeah, I'm ready.

5814
03:06:29,660 --> 03:06:30,820
Let's move on through guys.

5815
03:06:31,020 --> 03:06:31,580
Let's do it.

5816
03:06:32,260 --> 03:06:32,720
Friendship.

5817
03:06:33,060 --> 03:06:33,520
Yay.

5818
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:36,340
Hey, hey, hey.

5819
03:06:36,360 --> 03:06:37,380
Sound a little more exciting.

5820
03:06:38,040 --> 03:06:38,500
Yay.

5821
03:06:40,200 --> 03:06:40,880
Wall bounce.

5822
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:42,920
I love it.

5823
03:06:45,260 --> 03:06:46,360
We're doing so well.

5824
03:06:47,020 --> 03:06:48,080
I don't know.

5825
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:49,620
Okay.

5826
03:06:49,720 --> 03:06:50,680
Keep on moving guys.

5827
03:06:50,780 --> 03:06:51,160
Okay.

5828
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:52,280
I'm not gonna look up.

5829
03:06:52,320 --> 03:06:52,980
I'm not gonna look up.

5830
03:06:53,460 --> 03:06:53,760
No.

5831
03:06:53,900 --> 03:06:54,560
We're good.

5832
03:06:54,660 --> 03:06:55,280
We're so good.

5833
03:06:55,300 --> 03:06:55,880
I'm not gonna look up.

5834
03:06:57,140 --> 03:06:58,620
I 100% just picked the wrong perk.

5835
03:06:58,720 --> 03:06:59,020
We're good.

5836
03:06:59,240 --> 03:06:59,920
I'm look... Oh.

5837
03:07:00,100 --> 03:07:00,400
Whoa.

5838
03:07:00,740 --> 03:07:02,300
I hear an evac tower in front of us.

5839
03:07:02,460 --> 03:07:02,880
That's good.

5840
03:07:03,460 --> 03:07:03,920
On me.

5841
03:07:03,960 --> 03:07:04,100
On me.

5842
03:07:04,800 --> 03:07:05,800
Literally right on us.

5843
03:07:06,820 --> 03:07:07,120
Yeah.

5844
03:07:07,140 --> 03:07:07,460
Like on me.

5845
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:07,680
On me.

5846
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:07,880
On me.

5847
03:07:07,880 --> 03:07:08,080
On me.

5848
03:07:08,300 --> 03:07:08,640
We're good.

5849
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:08,820
We're good.

5850
03:07:08,820 --> 03:07:08,960
We're good.

5851
03:07:08,960 --> 03:07:09,380
Back up.

5852
03:07:09,420 --> 03:07:09,640
Back up.

5853
03:07:09,700 --> 03:07:09,780
We're good.

5854
03:07:09,840 --> 03:07:10,220
Keep moving.

5855
03:07:10,320 --> 03:07:10,520
Keep moving.

5856
03:07:10,600 --> 03:07:10,880
Okay.

5857
03:07:10,900 --> 03:07:11,160
Okay.

5858
03:07:11,160 --> 03:07:11,280
Okay.

5859
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:12,260
They conda queued.

5860
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:13,200
Yeah.

5861
03:07:13,240 --> 03:07:13,360
Yeah.

5862
03:07:13,360 --> 03:07:15,100
I hear a fight to my left.

5863
03:07:15,620 --> 03:07:15,920
Yeah.

5864
03:07:15,960 --> 03:07:16,040
Yeah.

5865
03:07:16,040 --> 03:07:16,840
Just keep on coming guys.

5866
03:07:16,940 --> 03:07:17,200
Alright.

5867
03:07:17,260 --> 03:07:17,560
I'm going.

5868
03:07:17,620 --> 03:07:18,220
I'm walking forward.

5869
03:07:18,280 --> 03:07:18,820
I'm walking forward.

5870
03:07:18,960 --> 03:07:20,700
They're taking the thing up now.

5871
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:21,540
That's okay.

5872
03:07:21,700 --> 03:07:22,140
We're good.

5873
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:23,580
We're just chilling here.

5874
03:07:23,640 --> 03:07:24,840
We're going to move up.

5875
03:07:25,380 --> 03:07:26,040
I just want these guys to leave.

5876
03:07:26,140 --> 03:07:26,520
We're good.

5877
03:07:26,580 --> 03:07:26,880
They're leaving.

5878
03:07:27,040 --> 03:07:27,180
They're leaving.

5879
03:07:27,240 --> 03:07:27,440
They're leaving.

5880
03:07:28,960 --> 03:07:29,520
I think.

5881
03:07:29,600 --> 03:07:29,720
No.

5882
03:07:29,780 --> 03:07:29,960
On me.

5883
03:07:30,240 --> 03:07:30,820
I'm not leaving.

5884
03:07:30,940 --> 03:07:31,160
No.

5885
03:07:31,160 --> 03:07:31,360
No.

5886
03:07:31,400 --> 03:07:31,600
No.

5887
03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:31,760
No.

5888
03:07:31,760 --> 03:07:32,320
What are they doing?

5889
03:07:34,080 --> 03:07:35,340
These guys are stressing me the fuck out.

5890
03:07:35,960 --> 03:07:36,240
Okay.

5891
03:07:36,460 --> 03:07:36,820
Follow me.

5892
03:07:36,840 --> 03:07:37,100
Follow me.

5893
03:07:37,140 --> 03:07:37,640
You guys coming?

5894
03:07:38,120 --> 03:07:38,400
Yeah.

5895
03:07:38,600 --> 03:07:38,660
Yeah.

5896
03:07:38,660 --> 03:07:38,860
Yeah.

5897
03:07:39,020 --> 03:07:40,140
There's a Watson fence.

5898
03:07:40,260 --> 03:07:40,740
There's a Watson fence.

5899
03:07:40,800 --> 03:07:41,260
There's a Watson fence.

5900
03:07:41,360 --> 03:07:44,800
We gotta send it.

5901
03:07:44,820 --> 03:07:45,300
We gotta send it.

5902
03:07:45,320 --> 03:07:45,800
Believe in me.

5903
03:07:45,820 --> 03:07:46,240
Believe in me.

5904
03:07:46,260 --> 03:07:46,620
Believe in me.

5905
03:07:46,660 --> 03:07:47,280
I'm believing.

5906
03:07:47,300 --> 03:07:47,540
I'm believing.

5907
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:48,220
I'm believing.

5908
03:07:50,120 --> 03:07:50,620
We're good.

5909
03:07:51,820 --> 03:07:52,320
We're good.

5910
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:53,940
Play slow, we're vibing.

5911
03:07:53,940 --> 03:07:55,260
We can play this pillar too if we need to.

5912
03:07:55,320 --> 03:07:55,660
We're okay.

5913
03:07:56,900 --> 03:07:58,260
Okay, I'm going to leave.

5914
03:07:59,400 --> 03:08:00,580
Go to the pillar, go to the pillar.

5915
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:01,020
Yeah, I'm dead.

5916
03:08:02,760 --> 03:08:03,500
I'm good, I'm alive.

5917
03:08:03,660 --> 03:08:04,600
I'm alive, I think.

5918
03:08:04,760 --> 03:08:05,220
I'm dead.

5919
03:08:05,460 --> 03:08:07,040
I think, I think, I think I'm alive.

5920
03:08:07,040 --> 03:08:07,940
We're good, we're good, we're good.

5921
03:08:08,020 --> 03:08:08,920
Okay, I'm batting.

5922
03:08:08,940 --> 03:08:10,000
We're okay, we're okay.

5923
03:08:10,040 --> 03:08:10,640
Just play slow.

5924
03:08:11,020 --> 03:08:12,060
Play slow, we're fine.

5925
03:08:12,180 --> 03:08:14,000
Okay, there's a fence to our left here too.

5926
03:08:15,040 --> 03:08:16,400
We're vibing, just vibing guys.

5927
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:17,060
We're so good.

5928
03:08:17,160 --> 03:08:17,820
Oh, I'm so good.

5929
03:08:17,860 --> 03:08:18,540
I feel so healthy.

5930
03:08:18,680 --> 03:08:19,000
We're so good.

5931
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:19,840
We're so fine.

5932
03:08:19,840 --> 03:08:21,140
I feel very healthy right now.

5933
03:08:21,140 --> 03:08:23,840
I'm still vibing, it's not even funny guys.

5934
03:08:23,900 --> 03:08:24,420
Oh my god.

5935
03:08:24,920 --> 03:08:25,360
I'm dead.

5936
03:08:25,540 --> 03:08:26,600
We're alive, I'm good guys.

5937
03:08:26,780 --> 03:08:28,080
No, no, you're good, you're good, you're good.

5938
03:08:28,580 --> 03:08:29,340
Just fucking chill.

5939
03:08:29,480 --> 03:08:29,600
I'm looking to my right.

5940
03:08:30,220 --> 03:08:31,320
Live the fuck out, bro.

5941
03:08:32,800 --> 03:08:33,660
I'm alive, I'm dead.

5942
03:08:34,300 --> 03:08:35,440
We're okay, I think.

5943
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:37,300
Oh, this is the... I don't know, man.

5944
03:08:37,420 --> 03:08:39,100
I don't feel very comfortable here.

5945
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:40,580
I feel very exposed for some reason.

5946
03:08:40,700 --> 03:08:42,700
We're going to wait for my ulti and try to go up here.

5947
03:08:42,820 --> 03:08:43,140
Okay.

5948
03:08:43,580 --> 03:08:44,220
On that house.

5949
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:45,180
But you guys stay here.

5950
03:08:45,420 --> 03:08:47,100
There's people literally right here.

5951
03:08:48,140 --> 03:08:49,960
Oh my god, what is this mirage doing?

5952
03:08:50,060 --> 03:08:51,120
How is he able to sit out here?

5953
03:08:51,140 --> 03:08:51,340
Man.

5954
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:54,140
I'm just saying there's people right here above me.

5955
03:08:54,660 --> 03:08:55,380
Okay, that's fine.

5956
03:08:55,460 --> 03:08:55,760
We're good.

5957
03:08:55,920 --> 03:08:56,580
We're vibing.

5958
03:09:01,690 --> 03:09:02,370
We're good.

5959
03:09:02,510 --> 03:09:02,790
We're good.

5960
03:09:02,890 --> 03:09:03,010
We're good.

5961
03:09:03,010 --> 03:09:03,710
We just lay low.

5962
03:09:04,870 --> 03:09:05,550
Chill out.

5963
03:09:05,670 --> 03:09:06,370
You know what I mean?

5964
03:09:07,370 --> 03:09:08,450
I'm stressed the fuck out.

5965
03:09:08,950 --> 03:09:09,970
I'm so stressed out.

5966
03:09:09,990 --> 03:09:10,710
I'm so stressed out.

5967
03:09:10,750 --> 03:09:11,990
But we're not 20th.

5968
03:09:12,390 --> 03:09:13,390
We're not 20th.

5969
03:09:13,730 --> 03:09:15,310
Yeah, but we need to...

5970
03:09:15,310 --> 03:09:16,170
Wow, bro.

5971
03:09:16,250 --> 03:09:18,230
How are these kids able to peek this?

5972
03:09:19,010 --> 03:09:21,690
I'm so lost how people are able to do this.

5973
03:09:23,530 --> 03:09:23,930
It's okay.

5974
03:09:23,990 --> 03:09:24,210
We're good.

5975
03:09:24,210 --> 03:09:24,330
We're good.

5976
03:09:24,330 --> 03:09:25,230
Tembo, you're good where you're at.

5977
03:09:25,330 --> 03:09:25,650
You're fine.

5978
03:09:26,110 --> 03:09:26,990
Tembo, move up more here.

5979
03:09:27,090 --> 03:09:27,710
Here, right?

5980
03:09:28,530 --> 03:09:29,290
One place left.

5981
03:09:29,410 --> 03:09:30,050
Tembo, just don't.

5982
03:09:31,930 --> 03:09:32,670
We're good, guys.

5983
03:09:33,010 --> 03:09:35,390
How are these teams able to do this to us?

5984
03:09:35,910 --> 03:09:36,970
I'm getting harassed.

5985
03:09:36,970 --> 03:09:38,150
Tembo, please save us.

5986
03:09:38,510 --> 03:09:40,230
How are they able to get these angles?

5987
03:09:40,570 --> 03:09:41,150
I'm getting...

5988
03:09:41,150 --> 03:09:42,170
Why is no one here?

5989
03:09:42,490 --> 03:09:43,050
I'm getting...

5990
03:09:43,470 --> 03:09:45,230
I'm getting harassed right now.

5991
03:09:45,890 --> 03:09:46,470
You're good.

5992
03:09:46,470 --> 03:09:46,830
You're good.

5993
03:09:46,850 --> 03:09:47,070
You're good.

5994
03:09:47,130 --> 03:09:47,750
I'm looking for you.

5995
03:09:47,830 --> 03:09:48,530
I'm pre-firing.

5996
03:09:48,610 --> 03:09:49,130
No one's there.

5997
03:09:50,050 --> 03:09:51,190
There's no safe .

5998
03:09:51,190 --> 03:09:51,730
No one's there.

5999
03:09:52,010 --> 03:09:52,310
No one's there.

6000
03:09:52,790 --> 03:09:54,190
There's no safe .

6001
03:09:54,190 --> 03:09:54,550
Great fences, kid.

6002
03:09:54,650 --> 03:09:55,810
Good thinking, man.

6003
03:09:56,850 --> 03:09:57,850
Great fences, kiddo.

6004
03:09:57,970 --> 03:09:58,390
We're here.

6005
03:09:58,670 --> 03:09:59,810
They don't shoot us.

6006
03:10:00,010 --> 03:10:00,530
We're good.

6007
03:10:00,530 --> 03:10:02,050
Am I safe here or...

6008
03:10:02,050 --> 03:10:03,610
Yeah, you stay there, stay there.

6009
03:10:05,010 --> 03:10:05,610
Don't stay there.

6010
03:10:05,650 --> 03:10:06,030
Don't stay there.

6011
03:10:06,150 --> 03:10:06,570
Come on.

6012
03:10:06,630 --> 03:10:06,910
Come on.

6013
03:10:06,990 --> 03:10:07,370
Come on.

6014
03:10:07,370 --> 03:10:07,470
Come on.

6015
03:10:09,670 --> 03:10:11,150
How are you getting shot?

6016
03:10:11,250 --> 03:10:12,730
Where are you getting shot from?

6017
03:10:12,890 --> 03:10:13,350
I don't know!

6018
03:10:14,230 --> 03:10:15,550
How is this possible?

6019
03:10:16,290 --> 03:10:16,690
No.

6020
03:10:18,110 --> 03:10:18,510
There's no .

6021
03:10:21,090 --> 03:10:21,890
There's no a us.

6022
03:10:21,990 --> 03:10:24,170
Dude, I'm so bad and...

6023
03:10:24,170 --> 03:10:26,090
A building would be nice.

6024
03:10:26,610 --> 03:10:28,370
A building would be fantastic right now.

6025
03:10:28,570 --> 03:10:30,630
We just take the car and eat a building?

6026
03:10:31,270 --> 03:10:32,230
No, you guys stay here.

6027
03:10:32,310 --> 03:10:33,210
I'm gonna try to figure something out.

6028
03:10:33,250 --> 03:10:33,550
Stay here.

6029
03:10:34,010 --> 03:10:35,990
This team above us must have so much space.

6030
03:10:36,070 --> 03:10:36,790
That's why they're doing this.

6031
03:10:37,470 --> 03:10:39,230
There's no way they're able to... there's no way.

6032
03:10:39,470 --> 03:10:41,110
I'm so scared, man.

6033
03:10:41,370 --> 03:10:43,650
We're actually lowkey not awful, if I'm being honest.

6034
03:10:44,670 --> 03:10:46,770
I was literally in the worst spot possible.

6035
03:10:47,130 --> 03:10:47,610
No, no.

6036
03:10:47,610 --> 03:10:48,570
This spot where I'm at is good.

6037
03:10:49,270 --> 03:10:49,890
Okay, I'm...

6038
03:10:50,710 --> 03:10:51,530
I'm okay now.

6039
03:10:51,530 --> 03:10:53,310
I'm not panicking anymore.

6040
03:10:53,350 --> 03:10:54,350
Guys, I've calmed down.

6041
03:10:55,430 --> 03:10:56,230
Did you?

6042
03:10:56,370 --> 03:10:56,550
Did you?

6043
03:10:57,870 --> 03:10:59,170
Guys, you just threw up everywhere.

6044
03:10:59,330 --> 03:11:00,170
Guys, I'm chilling now.

6045
03:11:01,850 --> 03:11:03,390
Guys, I'm not anxious anymore.

6046
03:11:03,510 --> 03:11:04,030
I'm okay now.

6047
03:11:04,170 --> 03:11:04,630
I've calmed down.

6048
03:11:05,270 --> 03:11:07,070
I'm not stressed anymore, guys.

6049
03:11:07,950 --> 03:11:09,610
I think I feel like a better...

6050
03:11:09,610 --> 03:11:11,790
I feel like a much better person.

6051
03:11:17,130 --> 03:11:17,710
You know what?

6052
03:11:18,090 --> 03:11:19,570
Maybe this spot is doable.

6053
03:11:20,110 --> 03:11:20,210
You know?

6054
03:11:21,630 --> 03:11:25,490
If we lay low, like you guys just don't peek, no one's gonna think someone's playing here.

6055
03:11:25,490 --> 03:11:26,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6056
03:11:26,130 --> 03:11:27,070
Yeah, exactly.

6057
03:11:27,090 --> 03:11:28,690
Not all of these Watson fences.

6058
03:11:28,990 --> 03:11:31,310
Who the fuck would play here, bro?

6059
03:11:31,450 --> 03:11:31,850
Honestly.

6060
03:11:33,110 --> 03:11:35,730
Yeah, who the fuck put all these Watson fences there?

6061
03:11:35,770 --> 03:11:36,490
There's nobody here.

6062
03:11:37,450 --> 03:11:38,810
I'm gonna be honest, guys.

6063
03:11:38,910 --> 03:11:45,050
If there's one thing I took today from all these games, in order for Challenge Circuit to work, I gotta step my eye jelly on it.

6064
03:11:45,130 --> 03:11:45,450
Holy fuck.

6065
03:11:46,290 --> 03:11:47,330
Oh my god.

6066
03:11:47,630 --> 03:11:48,590
I am rusty.

6067
03:11:49,210 --> 03:11:50,290
I think we all are.

6068
03:11:50,650 --> 03:11:52,710
We are all definitely rusty, I'll admit.

6069
03:11:53,710 --> 03:11:54,250
Wait, okay.

6070
03:11:54,530 --> 03:11:55,390
I just wanna know.

6071
03:11:55,450 --> 03:11:56,210
Is Greek's team dead?

6072
03:11:56,850 --> 03:11:57,410
I hope.

6073
03:11:57,490 --> 03:11:58,810
I haven't seen it.

6074
03:11:58,890 --> 03:12:00,010
I haven't seen 14 yet.

6075
03:12:00,190 --> 03:12:01,550
Oh, we haven't seen... No, fuck.

6076
03:12:01,630 --> 03:12:02,430
Okay, he's still alive.

6077
03:12:02,790 --> 03:12:03,890
It's so bad for us, guys.

6078
03:12:03,910 --> 03:12:04,430
That's so bad.

6079
03:12:04,450 --> 03:12:05,030
He's still alive.

6080
03:12:07,090 --> 03:12:08,330
We need to look at Team 14.

6081
03:12:08,370 --> 03:12:09,430
The only issue here that I'm...

6082
03:12:09,430 --> 03:12:17,250
The only issue we have, like genuinely, is if this team above us just... the zone like pulls up more and they're the only team inside docks, then they could... Oh, they're not.

6083
03:12:17,330 --> 03:12:17,850
They're getting shot at.

6084
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:18,150
That's good.

6085
03:12:18,250 --> 03:12:18,570
Oh, nice.

6086
03:12:18,570 --> 03:12:18,930
That's good.

6087
03:12:18,950 --> 03:12:19,110
That's good.

6088
03:12:19,810 --> 03:12:20,170
Yeah.

6089
03:12:20,170 --> 03:12:20,650
That's good.

6090
03:12:20,690 --> 03:12:20,930
We're fine.

6091
03:12:20,930 --> 03:12:21,890
We're so healthy.

6092
03:12:23,230 --> 03:12:24,010
That's a great chat.

6093
03:12:24,330 --> 03:12:25,150
That's a great one.

6094
03:12:25,290 --> 03:12:27,270
Everybody knows we're here now, too, so that's okay.

6095
03:12:27,270 --> 03:12:27,430
No, it's fine.

6096
03:12:27,430 --> 03:12:27,790
That's great.

6097
03:12:27,890 --> 03:12:28,310
That's great.

6098
03:12:28,350 --> 03:12:28,630
That's great.

6099
03:12:28,630 --> 03:12:29,990
We're creating presence now, right?

6100
03:12:30,090 --> 03:12:30,850
Now we want presence.

6101
03:12:30,890 --> 03:12:31,990
Yeah, and now we want presence.

6102
03:12:31,990 --> 03:12:32,330
Yeah.

6103
03:12:32,390 --> 03:12:32,750
Yeah.

6104
03:12:33,110 --> 03:12:33,870
Yeah, I'm learning.

6105
03:12:33,870 --> 03:12:34,650
I'm learning from your IGL.

6106
03:12:34,810 --> 03:12:36,130
Now we want people to know we're here.

6107
03:12:36,530 --> 03:12:36,890
Good.

6108
03:12:36,950 --> 03:12:38,030
You're doing so good.

6109
03:12:41,870 --> 03:12:43,330
I'm just gonna stay here, still.

6110
03:12:43,490 --> 03:12:45,250
I'm gonna... I'm gonna stay here.

6111
03:12:45,550 --> 03:12:46,510
There's people all over the room.

6112
03:12:46,510 --> 03:12:48,810
To be fair, though, we did get fucked over, like, pretty hard again.

6113
03:12:48,910 --> 03:12:49,670
Like, every time.

6114
03:12:49,730 --> 03:12:50,550
It's pretty horrible.

6115
03:12:50,670 --> 03:12:50,910
I think, like, I think...

6116
03:12:50,930 --> 03:12:54,090
I think everybody bullied us out of a good POI.

6117
03:12:54,850 --> 03:12:55,990
That's exactly what it is.

6118
03:12:56,110 --> 03:12:58,270
I think that's what happened.

6119
03:12:59,710 --> 03:13:01,290
Everybody just kicked us out.

6120
03:13:01,670 --> 03:13:03,650
They're like, okay, uh, next week, put Geyser.

6121
03:13:03,710 --> 03:13:05,650
They're like, uh, alright, yeah, they can have that.

6122
03:13:05,750 --> 03:13:08,090
They're like, alright, we'll take that for them.

6123
03:13:08,850 --> 03:13:10,270
They're like, oh, it's next week.

6124
03:13:10,490 --> 03:13:11,250
That's on there.

6125
03:13:11,630 --> 03:13:12,930
Like, I mean...

6126
03:13:13,450 --> 03:13:14,410
They don't even have a pro on their team.

6127
03:13:14,530 --> 03:13:15,430
Yeah, they don't even have a pro.

6128
03:13:15,490 --> 03:13:17,550
They literally have a platform and a diamond.

6129
03:13:18,450 --> 03:13:19,270
And another plat.

6130
03:13:22,070 --> 03:13:24,050
They literally have three plat players.

6131
03:13:24,830 --> 03:13:26,170
Okay, here's the moment of truth, guys.

6132
03:13:27,390 --> 03:13:29,230
Why is team 14 still...

6133
03:13:30,210 --> 03:13:31,590
Wait, but this is your tournament.

6134
03:13:31,650 --> 03:13:34,950
How did you let these people fucking... Oh, my god.

6135
03:13:35,550 --> 03:13:37,030
The zone pulls back.

6136
03:13:37,430 --> 03:13:39,370
Okay, this is gonna be the craziest thing I ever said.

6137
03:13:39,690 --> 03:13:40,990
We should get middle of fight night.

6138
03:13:41,630 --> 03:13:42,710
Like, inside fight night?

6139
03:13:42,790 --> 03:13:43,010
Yes.

6140
03:13:43,250 --> 03:13:44,730
How do we run past everybody?

6141
03:13:45,490 --> 03:13:47,790
I mean, I get this vehicle, we queue in there.

6142
03:13:47,850 --> 03:13:48,650
Or, I boost in there.

6143
03:13:49,250 --> 03:13:50,230
Okay, do we do it now?

6144
03:13:50,410 --> 03:13:50,770
Now?

6145
03:13:50,930 --> 03:13:52,230
Wait, wait, wait, come with me.

6146
03:13:52,250 --> 03:13:52,850
Doki, come over here.

6147
03:13:52,910 --> 03:13:53,070
Yeah.

6148
03:13:53,330 --> 03:13:53,570
Okay.

6149
03:13:56,470 --> 03:13:56,750
Okay.

6150
03:13:58,290 --> 03:14:00,850
I have an ass port, but I think we should go for the trident because it's funnier.

6151
03:14:00,970 --> 03:14:01,250
Okay.

6152
03:14:03,170 --> 03:14:03,730
Jesus Christ.

6153
03:14:04,010 --> 03:14:05,710
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

6154
03:14:06,350 --> 03:14:07,430
Boost, boost, boost, boost!

6155
03:14:09,150 --> 03:14:10,590
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out!

6156
03:14:11,510 --> 03:14:12,410
No, I got in!

6157
03:14:13,290 --> 03:14:14,210
It's an all squad.

6158
03:14:14,930 --> 03:14:15,810
Why is there an all squad?

6159
03:14:16,010 --> 03:14:17,350
Get away, Doki, get away!

6160
03:14:17,350 --> 03:14:17,790
I'm in!

6161
03:14:17,970 --> 03:14:22,290
I'm getting punched already!

6162
03:14:25,890 --> 03:14:27,290
Why is there a hole in the back?

6163
03:14:27,290 --> 03:14:27,910
I'm taking the port!

6164
03:14:28,170 --> 03:14:29,530
Oh wait, that's not it.

6165
03:14:29,650 --> 03:14:30,910
Why is there a hole?

6166
03:14:32,230 --> 03:14:33,630
Is there a team inside?

6167
03:14:34,470 --> 03:14:36,610
There is already a full team inside!

6168
03:14:37,010 --> 03:14:39,310
Wig, I don't think we should have done that, Wig.

6169
03:14:39,310 --> 03:14:39,910
Where is Wig?

6170
03:14:40,230 --> 03:14:41,030
Where is he?

6171
03:14:41,110 --> 03:14:41,290
You live?

6172
03:14:43,810 --> 03:14:45,410
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.

6173
03:14:45,410 --> 03:14:52,310
All I'm saying is that Wig, I think you might have made the wrong decision.

6174
03:14:53,010 --> 03:14:55,730
Why is there a full team with an Arcstar there?

6175
03:14:55,930 --> 03:14:56,590
Why?

6176
03:14:57,030 --> 03:14:58,830
Someone please tell me why.

6177
03:15:00,750 --> 03:15:02,170
That is unbelievable.

6178
03:15:03,030 --> 03:15:04,630
Wait, you have no white bats?

6179
03:15:04,830 --> 03:15:05,270
No!

6180
03:15:05,610 --> 03:15:06,450
You have zero?

6181
03:15:06,870 --> 03:15:07,850
Land turbine!

6182
03:15:08,750 --> 03:15:10,030
I have nothing!

6183
03:15:10,470 --> 03:15:12,170
How do you have no zero?

6184
03:15:12,570 --> 03:15:15,250
You just gotta last until 14 minutes.

6185
03:15:15,410 --> 03:15:15,770
14 minutes!

6186
03:15:15,770 --> 03:15:16,390
14 minutes!

6187
03:15:16,530 --> 03:15:16,670
14 minutes!

6188
03:15:16,670 --> 03:15:17,450
Nothing matters anymore!

6189
03:15:17,690 --> 03:15:18,830
Nothing matters!

6190
03:15:19,050 --> 03:15:26,170
We can beat Deeds if you get uh...

6191
03:15:26,170 --> 03:15:27,870
12, 9, 7, 5.

6192
03:15:27,970 --> 03:15:30,010
If you get top 5, we beat Deeds.

6193
03:15:30,770 --> 03:15:33,350
The second, the person above us.

6194
03:15:35,290 --> 03:15:39,710
The person on the team above us and we beat...

6195
03:15:42,770 --> 03:15:47,850
Oh my god, the fucking riskiest reload After the audio play, there's no idea what I'm hearing.

6196
03:15:51,150 --> 03:15:57,470
You know, okay, maybe we should not listen to something that I was like, but it would be so funny.

6197
03:15:57,610 --> 03:15:58,750
Like, maybe that's just not...

6198
03:15:59,650 --> 03:16:02,150
Yeah, but like, who else smiled during that?

6199
03:16:02,230 --> 03:16:02,910
No one else?

6200
03:16:03,210 --> 03:16:04,410
I got stuck.

6201
03:16:06,090 --> 03:16:07,390
You got fucked over.

6202
03:16:07,530 --> 03:16:09,310
Wait, you got stuck or our car got stuck?

6203
03:16:09,390 --> 03:16:10,250
Because I got hit too.

6204
03:16:10,410 --> 03:16:12,810
Oh, maybe our car got hit and all of us...

6205
03:16:12,810 --> 03:16:14,290
No, why are you peeking?

6206
03:16:14,350 --> 03:16:15,410
Why are you looking?

6207
03:16:15,490 --> 03:16:18,350
I didn't know if they were still inside fighting or if I'm going in there and scrapping.

6208
03:16:18,470 --> 03:16:20,570
Look at your heels!

6209
03:16:21,270 --> 03:16:25,250
The fact that you have the confidence to even look at somebody.

6210
03:16:27,170 --> 03:16:29,310
At least some of us get top 10.

6211
03:16:30,410 --> 03:16:32,550
I'm fucking dead in this next zone, for sure.

6212
03:16:33,130 --> 03:16:34,350
You don't know that.

6213
03:16:36,510 --> 03:16:39,410
You can craft us in the north?

6214
03:16:40,170 --> 03:16:41,050
Craft you?

6215
03:16:42,810 --> 03:16:45,490
Okay, if he crafts us, where is he going to rez?

6216
03:16:46,310 --> 03:16:47,190
That's not delusional?

6217
03:16:47,270 --> 03:16:47,590
Come on.

6218
03:16:47,930 --> 03:16:50,250
Where is he going to rez, Tempo?

6219
03:16:50,690 --> 03:16:53,690
I should realistically die to Storm here so I don't give Deeds a kill.

6220
03:16:54,350 --> 03:16:55,110
Find a movie.

6221
03:16:55,510 --> 03:16:56,170
Do you know?

6222
03:16:56,190 --> 03:16:56,770
Do you know?

6223
03:16:57,030 --> 03:16:59,690
Wait, Tempo didn't even know CC was next week.

6224
03:16:59,750 --> 03:17:01,050
He thought it was the week after.

6225
03:17:01,730 --> 03:17:02,530
Oh, I thought so too.

6226
03:17:02,770 --> 03:17:03,970
Oh wait, what the fuck did you do?

6227
03:17:06,990 --> 03:17:12,150
I did not know to play next week.

6228
03:17:12,150 --> 03:17:13,390
I do not have enough time to prep for that.

6229
03:17:13,510 --> 03:17:15,950
We are playing next week, guys!

6230
03:17:16,910 --> 03:17:17,570
This is good.

6231
03:17:17,610 --> 03:17:17,990
This is good.

6232
03:17:18,050 --> 03:17:18,610
People are dying.

6233
03:17:19,790 --> 03:17:20,390
There's no one middle.

6234
03:17:20,490 --> 03:17:20,910
Do I go middle?

6235
03:17:21,690 --> 03:17:22,070
Do it.

6236
03:17:22,090 --> 03:17:22,350
Inside?

6237
03:17:22,670 --> 03:17:24,010
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

6238
03:17:24,010 --> 03:17:25,350
Do it and then there might be heals.

6239
03:17:25,390 --> 03:17:25,810
There might be heals.

6240
03:17:28,690 --> 03:17:29,110
There's heals.

6241
03:17:29,150 --> 03:17:30,010
There's my box on my left.

6242
03:17:30,030 --> 03:17:30,390
On the left.

6243
03:17:30,410 --> 03:17:30,690
That's me.

6244
03:17:30,750 --> 03:17:30,990
That's me.

6245
03:17:31,110 --> 03:17:31,810
Right, right, right, right.

6246
03:17:31,870 --> 03:17:32,130
To your right.

6247
03:17:32,130 --> 03:17:32,430
To your right.

6248
03:17:32,790 --> 03:17:33,330
I know.

6249
03:17:33,350 --> 03:17:34,130
I'm just nervous about these guys coming.

6250
03:17:34,170 --> 03:17:34,390
I know.

6251
03:17:34,590 --> 03:17:35,710
I'm nervous about them punching me in the face.

6252
03:17:36,350 --> 03:17:36,830
Just heal.

6253
03:17:38,350 --> 03:17:39,010
There's heals here.

6254
03:17:40,390 --> 03:17:41,330
Are you healing here?

6255
03:17:41,330 --> 03:17:41,350
No, I'm inside.

6256
03:17:42,070 --> 03:17:42,710
No, you're scared.

6257
03:17:43,390 --> 03:17:43,810
Yeah, yeah.

6258
03:17:43,890 --> 03:17:44,770
What the fuck do you mean?

6259
03:17:44,910 --> 03:17:45,770
Hey, chill.

6260
03:17:46,070 --> 03:17:46,650
Dottie, chill.

6261
03:17:46,690 --> 03:17:47,030
Dottie, chill.

6262
03:17:47,370 --> 03:17:47,870
Just leave.

6263
03:17:47,930 --> 03:17:48,250
Just leave.

6264
03:17:48,250 --> 03:17:48,550
Just leave.

6265
03:17:48,550 --> 03:17:48,830
Just heal.

6266
03:17:48,910 --> 03:17:49,290
Just heal.

6267
03:17:49,690 --> 03:17:50,470
You have time.

6268
03:17:50,470 --> 03:17:51,250
I know, but they're going to push.

6269
03:17:51,250 --> 03:17:51,970
They're going to come in here.

6270
03:17:52,450 --> 03:17:53,310
They're not going to push.

6271
03:17:53,310 --> 03:17:54,490
And the other team is going to come in there.

6272
03:17:54,770 --> 03:17:56,610
Yeah, and then you watch these two come inside.

6273
03:17:56,730 --> 03:17:57,910
They scare each other out.

6274
03:17:58,130 --> 03:17:58,650
You're safe.

6275
03:17:59,130 --> 03:17:59,450
Yeah.

6276
03:17:59,730 --> 03:18:02,890
No one can come in because the moment they come in, someone else will come in.

6277
03:18:03,050 --> 03:18:03,370
Yeah.

6278
03:18:03,950 --> 03:18:04,610
It's a scare tactic.

6279
03:18:04,870 --> 03:18:06,390
They're just trying to scare you.

6280
03:18:06,450 --> 03:18:06,730
I'm fucking dead.

6281
03:18:06,830 --> 03:18:07,270
I'm fucking dead.

6282
03:18:07,270 --> 03:18:07,710
They're trying to scare you.

6283
03:18:07,770 --> 03:18:08,830
Oh my god.

6284
03:18:09,250 --> 03:18:10,890
What the fuck just happened to me?

6285
03:18:13,410 --> 03:18:13,810
Dottie!

6286
03:18:14,550 --> 03:18:15,210
Let's go!

6287
03:18:16,550 --> 03:18:17,430
You got lost.

6288
03:18:18,830 --> 03:18:21,090
You got lost so hard.

6289
03:18:21,190 --> 03:18:22,530
What the fuck was that?

6290
03:18:22,830 --> 03:18:23,790
What happened to me?

6291
03:18:24,130 --> 03:18:25,190
What was that?

6292
03:18:25,910 --> 03:18:26,710
Top 10 is crazy though.

6293
03:18:26,750 --> 03:18:27,490
Top 10 is so good.

6294
03:18:27,550 --> 03:18:27,890
Look at that.

6295
03:18:28,030 --> 03:18:28,610
No, it's okay.

6296
03:18:28,710 --> 03:18:29,690
We're above Greek.

6297
03:18:30,410 --> 03:18:31,310
Oh my god.

6298
03:18:31,410 --> 03:18:33,070
We actually got arced in the car.

6299
03:18:33,350 --> 03:18:34,510
We're above Greek.

6300
03:18:34,590 --> 03:18:35,650
That's all that matters.

6301
03:18:36,450 --> 03:18:37,610
You know what's crazy there?

6302
03:18:37,710 --> 03:18:41,070
If that team is just not there to stick with an R star, we actually probably could get like top five again.

6303
03:18:41,330 --> 03:18:41,710
Yeah, we could.

6304
03:18:41,810 --> 03:18:43,110
It's actually insane how bad our luck is.

6305
03:18:43,130 --> 03:18:43,450
It's unreal.

6306
03:18:43,590 --> 03:18:43,830
Yeah.

6307
03:18:44,690 --> 03:18:47,330
I'm just saying, wait, the next time you headline...

6308
03:18:47,930 --> 03:18:48,330
Yeah.

6309
03:18:48,350 --> 03:18:49,070
The next time you headline...

6310
03:18:49,070 --> 03:18:49,930
No, I call POIs.

6311
03:18:49,970 --> 03:18:50,990
I'm getting the POI out there.

6312
03:18:51,090 --> 03:18:52,110
Next time you have an idea.

6313
03:18:53,550 --> 03:18:57,430
Next time you think you have an idea, go against that idea as well.

6314
03:18:58,130 --> 03:18:59,410
Yo, what the...

6315
03:19:00,710 --> 03:19:02,870
Every idea I have, just make it the opposite.

6316
03:19:06,650 --> 03:19:07,550
That is insane.

6317
03:19:07,830 --> 03:19:10,810
I can't believe the headliner got bullied.

6318
03:19:10,810 --> 03:19:12,070
I can't believe none of their POIs.

6319
03:19:12,570 --> 03:19:13,530
That is insane.

6320
03:19:13,910 --> 03:19:14,130
I know.

6321
03:19:17,210 --> 03:19:22,810
To be fair, it's good that we got, you know, it's good that we finally got team practice, you know?

6322
03:19:22,810 --> 03:19:23,470
Oh, I understand.

6323
03:19:23,630 --> 03:19:24,070
Without a doubt.

6324
03:19:24,290 --> 03:19:29,590
Because if we didn't before Challenger Circuit, I think it would have been even worse.

6325
03:19:29,710 --> 03:19:31,370
Wait, what are we playing for Challenger Circuit?

6326
03:19:31,810 --> 03:19:35,150
I mean, listen, my brain is fried after these six games.

6327
03:19:36,090 --> 03:19:37,330
What is meta?

6328
03:19:37,530 --> 03:19:40,710
I just told us to get in three-man Trident and boost into five-man Trident.

6329
03:19:41,310 --> 03:19:43,970
I mean, am I really capable of IGL-ing anyone at this point?

6330
03:19:48,290 --> 03:19:52,110
Okay, but also remember where you took us before we were in the Trident.

6331
03:19:53,350 --> 03:19:54,350
That was even...

6332
03:19:54,350 --> 03:19:56,690
We were... I think we were safe down there.

6333
03:19:56,870 --> 03:19:58,610
Oh, I did not feel safe.

6334
03:19:58,610 --> 03:19:59,150
We were good.

6335
03:19:59,330 --> 03:20:01,570
I did not feel safe, 100%.

6336
03:20:01,570 --> 03:20:03,670
I mean, if we just had a fucking beacon.

6337
03:20:04,010 --> 03:20:05,750
I did not feel safe at all.

6338
03:20:05,750 --> 03:20:06,470
One time today.

6339
03:20:06,710 --> 03:20:07,910
One time we had a...

6340
03:20:07,910 --> 03:20:12,070
Do you understand that in order to get a beacon today, we just had to send Tempo over to Harvester.

6341
03:20:12,650 --> 03:20:14,070
That was the only time we had a beacon.

6342
03:20:14,070 --> 03:20:19,810
We just dropped a literal manager of an esports team solo at a POI to get a beacon.

6343
03:20:19,970 --> 03:20:21,610
We didn't get a single beacon.

6344
03:20:21,790 --> 03:20:22,850
That's actually crazy.

6345
03:20:23,390 --> 03:20:24,270
That is crazy.

6346
03:20:24,790 --> 03:20:27,850
All six games we had zero beacons.

6347
03:20:28,210 --> 03:20:31,310
We just played this game on a hard difficulty, literally veteran mode.

6348
03:20:31,910 --> 03:20:33,270
And it's fucking Mac again.

6349
03:20:33,390 --> 03:20:33,970
God damn it.

6350
03:20:34,830 --> 03:20:35,470
Fuck me.

6351
03:20:35,810 --> 03:20:37,170
That's actually insane.

6352
03:20:37,730 --> 03:20:38,370
That's insane.

6353
03:20:38,470 --> 03:20:38,870
That's insane.

6354
03:20:39,030 --> 03:20:39,330
That's insane.

6355
03:20:41,970 --> 03:20:43,170
We had one game of beacon, right?

6356
03:20:43,210 --> 03:20:43,590
What was it?

6357
03:20:43,630 --> 03:20:44,370
No, we didn't.

6358
03:20:44,390 --> 03:20:45,870
We had to walk over to the beacon.

6359
03:20:46,510 --> 03:20:47,050
Oh, no, no.

6360
03:20:47,130 --> 03:20:47,910
We had one in Jurassic.

6361
03:20:48,130 --> 03:20:49,270
Oh, we had Jurassic, yeah.

6362
03:20:49,410 --> 03:20:50,470
One out of five, baby.

6363
03:20:50,910 --> 03:20:51,770
One out of five.

6364
03:20:52,870 --> 03:20:54,690
Did we get fucked over in Jurassic still?

6365
03:20:55,470 --> 03:20:56,370
No, we didn't.

6366
03:20:56,550 --> 03:20:56,630
We didn't.

6367
03:20:56,650 --> 03:20:57,390
We did pretty well.

6368
03:20:57,530 --> 03:20:58,150
We did pretty well.

6369
03:20:58,150 --> 03:21:00,430
No, we just needed a cat wall and we would have made like top five.

6370
03:21:00,450 --> 03:21:00,670
Yeah.

6371
03:21:01,510 --> 03:21:02,070
That's my bad.

6372
03:21:02,330 --> 03:21:02,650
Yeah.

6373
03:21:03,770 --> 03:21:04,630
We had a...

6374
03:21:05,050 --> 03:21:05,770
You know what?

6375
03:21:05,870 --> 03:21:08,890
In the end, we had a good vibe.

6376
03:21:09,930 --> 03:21:11,990
Honestly, I actually had so much fun today.

6377
03:21:11,990 --> 03:21:12,510
Thank you guys.

6378
03:21:12,550 --> 03:21:13,890
I'm just glad we weren't last.

6379
03:21:14,510 --> 03:21:15,310
Wait, wait, guys.

6380
03:21:15,490 --> 03:21:15,870
We're not last, right?

6381
03:21:15,870 --> 03:21:16,350
We're better than Reptar.

6382
03:21:16,650 --> 03:21:17,490
Yeah, we're not last.

6383
03:21:17,490 --> 03:21:20,710
In the end, Reptar was rank one last season.

6384
03:21:20,890 --> 03:21:21,710
In the end?

6385
03:21:21,930 --> 03:21:22,510
Oh, my God.

6386
03:21:22,510 --> 03:21:22,710
And we were...

6387
03:21:23,270 --> 03:21:25,290
Our team did better than him.

6388
03:21:25,590 --> 03:21:27,030
You're so fucking right.

6389
03:21:27,310 --> 03:21:30,270
We technically beat the rank one Pred.

6390
03:21:30,450 --> 03:21:31,770
Are we rank 25?

6391
03:21:32,210 --> 03:21:32,510
Yeah.

6392
03:21:32,550 --> 03:21:36,670
We beat rank one Pred as a plaque team.

6393
03:21:36,810 --> 03:21:37,770
Just remember that.

6394
03:21:37,910 --> 03:21:38,270
No.

6395
03:21:44,150 --> 03:21:46,130
You're a platinum right now?

6396
03:21:46,350 --> 03:21:46,750
Yeah.

6397
03:21:46,950 --> 03:21:47,450
Hey, see?

6398
03:21:47,490 --> 03:21:49,550
A full platinum squad did better than Reptar.

6399
03:21:49,730 --> 03:21:50,110
Yeah.

6400
03:21:50,170 --> 03:21:51,750
A full platinum squad did better than Reptar.

6401
03:21:53,110 --> 03:21:54,190
Rank 0.5.

6402
03:21:54,550 --> 03:21:55,310
We'll take that shit.

6403
03:21:55,450 --> 03:21:55,470
Yeah.

6404
03:21:56,490 --> 03:21:57,490
That's our win.

6405
03:21:57,690 --> 03:21:59,030
That is our win today.

6406
03:21:59,370 --> 03:21:59,650
Oh, no.

6407
03:21:59,710 --> 03:22:01,710
That is the only thing I'm taking home with pride tonight.

6408
03:22:02,770 --> 03:22:03,930
Better than Reptar.

6409
03:22:04,650 --> 03:22:08,130
I know Greek needs a shot of alcohol so bad right now.

6410
03:22:08,130 --> 03:22:08,490
It's okay.

6411
03:22:08,950 --> 03:22:09,350
It's okay.

6412
03:22:09,510 --> 03:22:09,910
It's okay.

6413
03:22:09,910 --> 03:22:11,970
The fact that Greek lost to us.

6414
03:22:12,370 --> 03:22:15,950
Oh, and just also if he's getting 20th, then he didn't have a vibe squad like us.

6415
03:22:16,030 --> 03:22:16,350
Oh, boy.

6416
03:22:16,430 --> 03:22:17,110
Oh, boy.

6417
03:22:17,110 --> 03:22:17,430
Yeah.

6418
03:22:17,450 --> 03:22:17,650
Yeah.

6419
03:22:17,690 --> 03:22:20,010
He didn't get to have the fun part.

6420
03:22:20,050 --> 03:22:22,250
He didn't take a trident into a full team.

6421
03:22:23,390 --> 03:22:24,110
Wait, dude.

6422
03:22:24,150 --> 03:22:24,950
Come on, man.

6423
03:22:25,270 --> 03:22:27,250
We had no idea there was a team there.

6424
03:22:30,030 --> 03:22:32,190
It happened so fast.

6425
03:22:32,330 --> 03:22:33,770
I didn't even know what happened.

6426
03:22:33,990 --> 03:22:34,670
I didn't even...

6427
03:22:34,670 --> 03:22:36,930
Things were going to be bad because the moment...

6428
03:22:36,930 --> 03:22:39,010
The thing you said was...

6429
03:22:39,010 --> 03:22:39,890
I'm going to...

6430
03:22:39,890 --> 03:22:42,470
I'm going to do something that might not be a good idea, but it'll be really funny.

6431
03:22:43,090 --> 03:22:43,970
That's what you said.

6432
03:22:44,290 --> 03:22:44,690
It was funny.

6433
03:22:45,310 --> 03:22:48,530
I mean, I sent you alone to 1v3 fist fight inside of fight night.

6434
03:22:48,610 --> 03:22:49,090
That's pretty funny.

6435
03:22:50,270 --> 03:22:53,810
You were getting your ass beat inside of fight night 1v3.

6436
03:22:58,230 --> 03:23:02,190
At least we got the content out of the way.

6437
03:23:04,850 --> 03:23:06,250
We got real content.

6438
03:23:06,590 --> 03:23:07,470
We had real content.

6439
03:23:07,510 --> 03:23:09,210
No other team had as much fun as us.

6440
03:23:09,890 --> 03:23:10,750
Who is this winning right now?

6441
03:23:11,450 --> 03:23:11,970
I don't know.

6442
03:23:11,990 --> 03:23:13,010
This team winning might have a good time.

6443
03:23:15,710 --> 03:23:16,810
They just wasted all their grenades.

6444
03:23:17,970 --> 03:23:18,910
They're not even pushing over yet.

6445
03:23:18,910 --> 03:23:19,670
Why did they just waste all their grenades?

6446
03:23:19,670 --> 03:23:19,730
Oh, yeah.

6447
03:23:19,750 --> 03:23:20,690
This is the watch party.

6448
03:23:20,870 --> 03:23:21,950
This is your watch party time.

6449
03:23:22,590 --> 03:23:22,870
Exactly.

6450
03:23:23,330 --> 03:23:25,930
Look, Wig wanted to die early so he could watch party.

6451
03:23:26,130 --> 03:23:26,690
In-game watch party.

6452
03:23:26,690 --> 03:23:26,830
Yeah.

6453
03:23:26,830 --> 03:23:27,330
Here you go, chat.

6454
03:23:27,370 --> 03:23:27,670
Look at that.

6455
03:23:27,690 --> 03:23:28,710
And the win is going to go.

6456
03:23:28,750 --> 03:23:29,110
What's going on?

6457
03:23:29,710 --> 03:23:29,990
Nice.

6458
03:23:30,110 --> 03:23:30,490
Who won?

6459
03:23:30,490 --> 03:23:30,530
Wow.

6460
03:23:30,530 --> 03:23:31,350
Look at that endgame.

6461
03:23:31,810 --> 03:23:32,090
Wow.

6462
03:23:32,590 --> 03:23:33,250
Oh, my God.

6463
03:23:33,310 --> 03:23:33,830
Who won?

6464
03:23:36,990 --> 03:23:37,550
That might be...

6465
03:23:37,550 --> 03:23:38,130
That might be Jen.

6466
03:23:39,490 --> 03:23:39,870
Jen, burn.

6467
03:23:39,890 --> 03:23:40,610
I think.

6468
03:23:41,730 --> 03:23:42,330
Oh, Jen.

6469
03:23:42,410 --> 03:23:42,590
Yeah.

6470
03:23:42,590 --> 03:23:42,990
Jen won.

6471
03:23:43,190 --> 03:23:43,550
Wait.

6472
03:23:43,630 --> 03:23:44,770
Do you actually memorize the skins?

6473
03:23:45,550 --> 03:23:45,910
Oh, my God.

6474
03:23:45,910 --> 03:23:48,370
Wasn't he, like, first place by, like, 30 points going in this game?

6475
03:23:48,370 --> 03:23:48,590
Yeah.

6476
03:23:48,950 --> 03:23:49,310
Yeah.

6477
03:23:49,490 --> 03:23:51,310
So did he just win by, like, 50 points?

6478
03:23:51,390 --> 03:23:52,410
I thought it was, like, 100 points.

6479
03:23:53,170 --> 03:23:53,890
Holy shit.

6480
03:23:53,910 --> 03:23:54,810
With girl, too?

6481
03:23:54,930 --> 03:23:56,050
Girls went crazy.

6482
03:23:56,370 --> 03:23:56,710
Man.

6483
03:23:56,830 --> 03:23:57,710
I wonder what that's like.

6484
03:23:57,710 --> 03:23:58,710
That was not us, guys.

6485
03:23:58,890 --> 03:23:59,910
I wonder what that's like.

6486
03:24:00,550 --> 03:24:01,850
I don't think we'll ever feel that.

6487
03:24:02,530 --> 03:24:03,170
No, you will.

6488
03:24:03,330 --> 03:24:04,010
Challenger circuit.

6489
03:24:05,630 --> 03:24:08,030
I don't think we'll ever know what that feels like.

6490
03:24:08,050 --> 03:24:08,650
Oh, my God.

6491
03:24:09,510 --> 03:24:09,870
Oh, my God.

6492
03:24:09,870 --> 03:24:10,990
We got fucking wrenched.

6493
03:24:12,810 --> 03:24:13,770
Guys, don't worry.

6494
03:24:14,030 --> 03:24:15,550
Look at where Team 14 is.

6495
03:24:16,330 --> 03:24:17,610
Look at where Team 14 is.

6496
03:24:17,610 --> 03:24:17,630
Good.

6497
03:24:17,650 --> 03:24:17,970
We're safe.

6498
03:24:18,130 --> 03:24:18,490
They didn't...

6499
03:24:18,490 --> 03:24:20,770
It would have been worrying if they got some kills.

6500
03:24:20,770 --> 03:24:21,210
Yeah, yeah.

6501
03:24:21,490 --> 03:24:21,990
Don't worry.

6502
03:24:22,110 --> 03:24:22,830
They had zero kills.

6503
03:24:22,910 --> 03:24:22,970
Wait.

6504
03:24:23,290 --> 03:24:25,230
How does Team 20 have three kills?

6505
03:24:25,430 --> 03:24:26,650
And they died in 20th?

6506
03:24:26,890 --> 03:24:27,530
I don't know.

6507
03:24:28,750 --> 03:24:29,150
They...

6508
03:24:29,150 --> 03:24:29,850
Wait.

6509
03:24:29,910 --> 03:24:30,130
What?

6510
03:24:30,290 --> 03:24:30,690
Yeah.

6511
03:24:30,990 --> 03:24:31,550
What the...

6512
03:24:31,550 --> 03:24:32,430
Or maybe they rez.

6513
03:24:32,530 --> 03:24:33,150
Maybe they rez.

6514
03:24:33,750 --> 03:24:35,990
They could have got picks and then the people rez.

6515
03:24:36,450 --> 03:24:36,850
Maybe.

6516
03:24:37,670 --> 03:24:38,650
We did it, guys.

6517
03:24:39,450 --> 03:24:39,850
We did it.

6518
03:24:39,870 --> 03:24:40,050
Guys.

6519
03:24:40,070 --> 03:24:41,370
Dude, what did we fucking get, man?

6520
03:24:41,410 --> 03:24:42,130
We had to get last.

6521
03:24:42,570 --> 03:24:42,970
No.

6522
03:24:43,030 --> 03:24:43,250
We're...

6523
03:24:43,250 --> 03:24:44,190
We're second last because...

6524
03:24:44,190 --> 03:24:45,110
We're second last.

6525
03:24:45,130 --> 03:24:46,950
Because Green's team never got a single point.

6526
03:24:47,130 --> 03:24:47,150
Is that your point?

6527
03:24:47,850 --> 03:24:48,250
Oh.

6528
03:24:48,790 --> 03:24:50,250
Everyone gets the same amount.

6529
03:24:50,930 --> 03:24:51,330
Yeah.

6530
03:24:51,350 --> 03:24:52,050
Everyone gets 400.

6531
03:24:52,230 --> 03:24:54,670
It's like 11th to 20th all get the same amount.

6532
03:24:55,450 --> 03:24:55,850
Okay.

6533
03:24:56,250 --> 03:24:56,650
Yeah.

6534
03:24:56,750 --> 03:24:57,250
So, we're fine.

6535
03:24:57,390 --> 03:24:58,390
It doesn't matter what place we're at.

6536
03:24:58,390 --> 03:24:58,910
Technically, we're 11.

6537
03:24:59,470 --> 03:24:59,870
Okay.

6538
03:24:59,950 --> 03:25:00,450
Makes sense.

6539
03:25:00,610 --> 03:25:00,810
Yeah.

6540
03:25:01,090 --> 03:25:02,070
Everybody's 11th place.

6541
03:25:02,670 --> 03:25:03,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6542
03:25:03,430 --> 03:25:03,830
Yeah.

6543
03:25:04,190 --> 03:25:06,650
Everybody is 11th place.

6544
03:25:06,850 --> 03:25:08,430
So, technically...

6545
03:25:08,870 --> 03:25:09,270
Technically?

6546
03:25:09,870 --> 03:25:10,670
We're all 11th place.

6547
03:25:10,850 --> 03:25:12,410
Except for Green, who's 12th.

6548
03:25:13,450 --> 03:25:13,930
What?

6549
03:25:14,050 --> 03:25:16,350
Apparently, the team above us in Docs was Greek.

6550
03:25:18,930 --> 03:25:19,410
Wait.

6551
03:25:19,510 --> 03:25:19,750
Really?

6552
03:25:19,790 --> 03:25:20,350
They were probably...

6553
03:25:20,350 --> 03:25:20,410
Wait.

6554
03:25:20,530 --> 03:25:20,650
Really?

6555
03:25:20,650 --> 03:25:21,410
I'm asking.

6556
03:25:21,530 --> 03:25:25,130
They were probably so confused why we took the Trident and left.

6557
03:25:25,210 --> 03:25:26,990
They were probably so dumbfounded.

6558
03:25:27,590 --> 03:25:28,990
That is unbelievable.

6559
03:25:29,070 --> 03:25:30,230
There's no fucking way.

6560
03:25:31,770 --> 03:25:33,650
He's probably like, they're taking the fucking Trident?

6561
03:25:35,210 --> 03:25:36,290
That is so fucking funny.

6562
03:25:36,290 --> 03:25:36,750
Look at us.

6563
03:25:36,750 --> 03:25:37,070
Holy shit.

6564
03:25:37,750 --> 03:25:38,910
Look at us go.

6565
03:25:39,370 --> 03:25:39,850
Oh, my God.

6566
03:25:39,870 --> 03:25:41,210
I told you guys.

6567
03:25:41,210 --> 03:25:42,410
I told you guys.

6568
03:25:43,270 --> 03:25:46,750
I bet you no one had as much fun as us, Chad.

6569
03:25:46,850 --> 03:25:47,050
Okay.

6570
03:25:47,050 --> 03:25:48,630
This was very good practice.

6571
03:25:49,010 --> 03:25:49,470
Yep.

6572
03:25:49,470 --> 03:25:50,490
For Challenger Circuit.

6573
03:25:50,950 --> 03:25:51,410
Agreed.

6574
03:25:51,630 --> 03:25:52,090
Yup.

6575
03:25:52,230 --> 03:25:52,610
Okay.

6576
03:25:52,650 --> 03:25:53,550
So, what did we learn today?

6577
03:25:53,710 --> 03:25:55,590
That we're gonna take it to Challenger Circuit?

6578
03:25:56,570 --> 03:25:57,470
I think...

6579
03:25:57,470 --> 03:25:59,710
Never get beacons, so don't bother with the controller character.

6580
03:25:59,770 --> 03:26:00,050
Okay.

6581
03:26:00,050 --> 03:26:01,370
No, that's not what we learned.

6582
03:26:01,590 --> 03:26:01,850
That's not what we learned.

6583
03:26:01,850 --> 03:26:02,590
That is not what we learned.

6584
03:26:03,030 --> 03:26:03,390
That is...

6585
03:26:03,390 --> 03:26:05,390
Thank God you understand what we learned today.

6586
03:26:05,490 --> 03:26:05,510
Okay.

6587
03:26:05,510 --> 03:26:07,070
Thank God we are talking about this now.

6588
03:26:07,370 --> 03:26:07,810
I just...

6589
03:26:07,810 --> 03:26:08,510
What do you mean?

6590
03:26:08,510 --> 03:26:09,850
That's exactly what we learned.

6591
03:26:09,850 --> 03:26:12,750
What we learned is that we need a POI with a scan.

6592
03:26:12,950 --> 03:26:13,610
Every game.

6593
03:26:13,630 --> 03:26:13,750
We need...

6594
03:26:13,750 --> 03:26:15,370
We need to figure out a POI.

6595
03:26:15,450 --> 03:26:16,910
And even we're gonna get contested.

6596
03:26:17,450 --> 03:26:17,590
Yeah.

6597
03:26:17,590 --> 03:26:17,930
We need...

6598
03:26:17,930 --> 03:26:23,090
We still need to figure out a POI and not get bullied out of our POI.

6599
03:26:23,510 --> 03:26:24,530
Unlike today.

6600
03:26:24,730 --> 03:26:24,770
I agree.

6601
03:26:24,950 --> 03:26:25,390
Yup.

6602
03:26:25,410 --> 03:26:25,590
Yup.

6603
03:26:26,870 --> 03:26:29,170
And we need to figure out what to play.

6604
03:26:29,490 --> 03:26:32,870
Cuz apparently, we might be playing this game for seven hours on Saturday.

6605
03:26:33,450 --> 03:26:33,890
Yup.

6606
03:26:34,550 --> 03:26:35,750
Seven hours of that.

6607
03:26:35,890 --> 03:26:36,910
We need to do better than that.

6608
03:26:37,070 --> 03:26:37,470
Yeah.

6609
03:26:38,550 --> 03:26:41,990
And it's going to be next week for sure.

6610
03:26:43,450 --> 03:26:43,890
Right?

6611
03:26:44,870 --> 03:26:48,170
Is it actually next week or did I just gaslight you two thinking it's next week?

6612
03:26:48,170 --> 03:26:48,190
Yeah.

6613
03:26:48,190 --> 03:26:48,210
I know.

6614
03:26:48,230 --> 03:26:48,770
It's next week.

6615
03:26:48,770 --> 03:26:48,990
Okay.

6616
03:26:49,110 --> 03:26:49,370
Okay.

6617
03:26:49,390 --> 03:26:50,270
It's actually next week.

6618
03:26:50,290 --> 03:26:50,550
Okay.

6619
03:26:56,430 --> 03:26:57,610
Oh my God.

6620
03:26:57,670 --> 03:26:57,950
Bro.

6621
03:26:58,110 --> 03:27:00,050
Your fucking chat wig.

6622
03:27:00,290 --> 03:27:03,150
I can see why Tempo is the manager.

6623
03:27:03,790 --> 03:27:04,290
It's not in here.

6624
03:27:04,290 --> 03:27:04,630
Who said that?

6625
03:27:06,110 --> 03:27:06,990
Holy shit.

6626
03:27:07,070 --> 03:27:07,450
Where is it?

6627
03:27:07,450 --> 03:27:07,750
Wait a minute.

6628
03:27:07,970 --> 03:27:08,830
I have mud.

6629
03:27:08,990 --> 03:27:09,250
Oh, no.

6630
03:27:09,290 --> 03:27:09,410
Wait.

6631
03:27:09,410 --> 03:27:09,750
I know.

6632
03:27:11,610 --> 03:27:11,930
Wait.

6633
03:27:12,010 --> 03:27:12,210
Oh, yeah.

6634
03:27:12,690 --> 03:27:13,010
100%.

6635
03:27:13,010 --> 03:27:13,490
Oh, my chat.

6636
03:27:13,510 --> 03:27:14,390
My chat's crazy right now.

6637
03:27:14,390 --> 03:27:14,530
Yeah.

6638
03:27:14,750 --> 03:27:15,070
Yeah.

6639
03:27:15,310 --> 03:27:18,750
I got shit on more today than I ever have in my life to be honest.

6640
03:27:18,870 --> 03:27:19,430
But my chat.

6641
03:27:19,430 --> 03:27:20,150
Are you going to be interviewed?

6642
03:27:20,210 --> 03:27:21,650
Cuz you're headlining this?

6643
03:27:22,170 --> 03:27:22,750
Hell no.

6644
03:27:22,770 --> 03:27:23,230
I was already interviewed.

6645
03:27:23,350 --> 03:27:24,110
Girl's going to get interviewed now.

6646
03:27:24,150 --> 03:27:24,610
What the fuck?

6647
03:27:24,730 --> 03:27:25,790
Are you going to be interviewed?

6648
03:27:25,930 --> 03:27:29,790
We should be having an interview for like the vibes.

6649
03:27:33,470 --> 03:27:34,290
I can't believe.

6650
03:27:34,450 --> 03:27:35,370
I can't believe we didn't get.

6651
03:27:35,430 --> 03:27:36,790
I can't believe you didn't bring us to the interview.

6652
03:27:37,110 --> 03:27:37,430
No.

6653
03:27:37,430 --> 03:27:37,950
Yeah.

6654
03:27:39,070 --> 03:27:39,430
Yeah.

6655
03:27:40,030 --> 03:27:41,090
They should get you on there.

6656
03:27:41,190 --> 03:27:41,410
No.

6657
03:27:41,510 --> 03:27:42,270
They should have got all of us.

6658
03:27:42,530 --> 03:27:43,750
What was your worst strategy today getting 19 place?

6659
03:27:43,930 --> 03:27:47,170
Well, NiceWeek told me three times to take a Trident when I shouldn't have.

6660
03:27:47,690 --> 03:27:48,570
And you know.

6661
03:27:48,810 --> 03:27:51,270
He denied me all correctly one time.

6662
03:27:51,410 --> 03:27:51,870
But you know.

6663
03:27:51,890 --> 03:27:52,630
We had a good time today.

6664
03:27:52,830 --> 03:27:53,030
Yeah.

6665
03:27:54,090 --> 03:27:54,450
Yeah.

6666
03:27:54,970 --> 03:28:00,050
He said like this was the last thing I heard was this might be a really bad idea, but it's going to be funny.

6667
03:28:00,810 --> 03:28:01,170
Yeah.

6668
03:28:03,570 --> 03:28:05,170
He said this is going to be funny.

6669
03:28:05,210 --> 03:28:06,610
And then none of us laughed afterwards.

6670
03:28:06,930 --> 03:28:07,290
Yeah.

6671
03:28:07,430 --> 03:28:08,710
And then we got Ark started.

6672
03:28:09,210 --> 03:28:10,910
I got confused.

6673
03:28:11,730 --> 03:28:13,390
I got so confused.

6674
03:28:13,570 --> 03:28:14,630
I didn't know what was going on.

6675
03:28:14,810 --> 03:28:16,510
All I know is I got stunned.

6676
03:28:16,910 --> 03:28:18,330
And then there was people.

6677
03:28:18,550 --> 03:28:20,010
Tempo had a bladder issue too.

6678
03:28:20,130 --> 03:28:23,490
So like honestly we should negate everything that happened.

6679
03:28:24,730 --> 03:28:25,170
Yeah.

6680
03:28:25,910 --> 03:28:28,110
We should just reset the scores.

6681
03:28:28,610 --> 03:28:29,710
Oh my God.

6682
03:28:30,110 --> 03:28:33,150
Reset and then multiply game one by six.

6683
03:28:34,570 --> 03:28:37,110
I don't think game one was the game that we did the best in.

6684
03:28:37,170 --> 03:28:37,410
It was like the best one we ever played.

6685
03:28:37,410 --> 03:28:38,270
This is the game four.

6686
03:28:38,810 --> 03:28:39,810
Yeah, we know.

6687
03:28:39,910 --> 03:28:40,730
We got like...

6688
03:28:40,730 --> 03:28:41,670
Green Pops out of six?

6689
03:28:42,750 --> 03:28:44,810
They won three games out of six.

6690
03:28:44,950 --> 03:28:45,610
Jen's team?

6691
03:28:47,230 --> 03:28:48,690
Yeah, that's fucking crazy.

6692
03:28:49,450 --> 03:28:51,290
Bro, that could've been me.

6693
03:28:53,230 --> 03:28:54,850
If I was... if Jen picked me.

6694
03:28:56,570 --> 03:28:58,290
You guys really got lost every game.

6695
03:28:59,690 --> 03:29:02,170
If Jen got you, he loses six out of six.

6696
03:29:02,350 --> 03:29:03,370
There's no way.

6697
03:29:03,410 --> 03:29:05,890
We should do a... we should have like a control group here.

6698
03:29:06,430 --> 03:29:08,730
Jen... every tournament, Jen will pick one of us.

6699
03:29:08,750 --> 03:29:10,070
And then see who plays us higher.

6700
03:29:10,830 --> 03:29:11,730
It's not gonna be me.

6701
03:29:14,190 --> 03:29:15,730
You're... you're playing higher than me sadly.

6702
03:29:17,850 --> 03:29:19,670
We gotta experiment here.

6703
03:29:19,830 --> 03:29:20,830
And see who's right.

6704
03:29:21,610 --> 03:29:23,230
That was so fucking fun, man.

6705
03:29:23,310 --> 03:29:24,070
Thank you guys so much.

6706
03:29:24,110 --> 03:29:25,170
I appreciate y'all for playing too.

6707
03:29:25,310 --> 03:29:25,890
Seriously guys.

6708
03:29:25,970 --> 03:29:26,610
That was really fun.

6709
03:29:28,790 --> 03:29:30,550
Let's play... maybe just fucking...

6710
03:29:30,550 --> 03:29:32,510
Maybe play some games or something like that if you guys want to.

6711
03:29:33,350 --> 03:29:34,230
Actually like ranked or anything.

6712
03:29:36,090 --> 03:29:36,490
We should really practice.

6713
03:29:36,590 --> 03:29:37,850
We should probably play a bit.

6714
03:29:38,210 --> 03:29:39,170
You guys wanna practice this week?

6715
03:29:39,290 --> 03:29:39,570
I'm down.

6716
03:29:39,690 --> 03:29:41,250
You got what?

6717
03:29:44,090 --> 03:29:45,530
Should it be next week?

6718
03:29:45,590 --> 03:29:46,590
Since CC's next week?

6719
03:29:47,310 --> 03:29:48,490
Oh yeah, that's what I meant.

6720
03:29:48,590 --> 03:29:49,250
Like Monday, my bad.

6721
03:29:49,450 --> 03:29:50,890
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

6722
03:29:50,930 --> 03:29:51,910
Wait, isn't today Monday?

6723
03:29:53,750 --> 03:29:54,550
Today is...

6724
03:29:55,870 --> 03:29:56,470
Today's Friday.

6725
03:29:58,090 --> 03:29:58,790
Is what?

6726
03:29:59,510 --> 03:29:59,910
What?

6727
03:30:00,170 --> 03:30:00,870
Nothing, nothing.

6728
03:30:01,930 --> 03:30:02,330
Temple.

6729
03:30:02,590 --> 03:30:03,470
Yeah, it's Friday.

6730
03:30:04,210 --> 03:30:04,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6731
03:30:05,890 --> 03:30:06,130
Oh.

6732
03:30:07,190 --> 03:30:09,050
Wait, did you not think it was Friday?

6733
03:30:09,970 --> 03:30:11,370
I forgot what day it was.

6734
03:30:12,810 --> 03:30:13,210
What?

6735
03:30:14,030 --> 03:30:15,810
Temple, how do you run shit so...

6736
03:30:15,810 --> 03:30:17,770
so efficiently but just don't even know the...

6737
03:30:17,770 --> 03:30:19,330
the week... the day of the week?

6738
03:30:20,470 --> 03:30:21,510
You're impressive, man.

6739
03:30:21,690 --> 03:30:23,050
I actually love you so much.

6740
03:30:23,110 --> 03:30:25,250
You're like the most functional, unfunctional person I've met in my life.

6741
03:30:25,270 --> 03:30:25,570
I'm not kidding.

6742
03:30:25,610 --> 03:30:26,890
Oh yeah, have you seen like...

6743
03:30:26,890 --> 03:30:28,930
Have you seen like all the...

6744
03:30:28,930 --> 03:30:31,050
like all of his... like his PC setup?

6745
03:30:31,310 --> 03:30:34,130
He has like five monitors or some shit.

6746
03:30:34,130 --> 03:30:35,370
Yeah, it's like he's like...

6747
03:30:35,370 --> 03:30:38,790
Yeah, and then Doki plastered all of her merch all over my screens.

6748
03:30:38,790 --> 03:30:39,350
Okay, not me.

6749
03:30:39,350 --> 03:30:40,450
It was like one of my...

6750
03:30:40,450 --> 03:30:42,610
one of my patents.

6751
03:30:42,850 --> 03:30:46,750
She's like, here you go, you should buy all of this Doki merch.

6752
03:30:47,030 --> 03:30:48,110
Buy Doki merch.

6753
03:30:48,190 --> 03:30:49,790
His walls are so barren.

6754
03:30:49,790 --> 03:30:51,010
Have you seen his walls?

6755
03:30:51,630 --> 03:30:55,850
Also, wait, you promised me you would buy like a Doki print and put it on your backdrop.

6756
03:30:56,290 --> 03:30:58,730
I promised you I'd buy it and then burn it.

6757
03:30:59,270 --> 03:31:01,290
You said you would put it behind you.

6758
03:31:02,170 --> 03:31:04,790
I'll get it behind you and I'll put it behind me and I'll burn it.

6759
03:31:04,810 --> 03:31:05,410
Alright, do it.

6760
03:31:05,530 --> 03:31:06,010
Do it.

6761
03:31:06,070 --> 03:31:06,430
Alright, deal.

6762
03:31:06,510 --> 03:31:06,770
Deal.

6763
03:31:06,950 --> 03:31:08,130
It's just your money.

6764
03:31:09,930 --> 03:31:11,050
Yeah, it's just my money.

6765
03:31:12,650 --> 03:31:14,130
It's just a picture of you.

6766
03:31:14,410 --> 03:31:15,670
It's literally your money.

6767
03:31:16,150 --> 03:31:17,290
Oh yeah, speaking of...

6768
03:31:18,150 --> 03:31:18,550
subs.

6769
03:31:18,910 --> 03:31:21,130
Oh my god, how many do you deserve, Tempo?

6770
03:31:21,170 --> 03:31:22,070
What is the sub count actually?

6771
03:31:22,230 --> 03:31:22,490
Tempo got like...

6772
03:31:22,490 --> 03:31:23,770
Wait, how many kills did we get?

6773
03:31:23,890 --> 03:31:24,770
Tempo got four kills.

6774
03:31:25,430 --> 03:31:26,490
Oh my god, did you?

6775
03:31:26,490 --> 03:31:27,410
That's 40 subs.

6776
03:31:27,490 --> 03:31:28,230
Four kills?

6777
03:31:28,390 --> 03:31:30,350
Five subs per kill, no?

6778
03:31:31,290 --> 03:31:32,650
Yeah, so 20 subs.

6779
03:31:32,850 --> 03:31:33,750
20 subs.

6780
03:31:34,670 --> 03:31:35,630
To Tempo, right?

6781
03:31:35,730 --> 03:31:36,190
Yeah, to Tempo.

6782
03:31:38,110 --> 03:31:39,350
And then 20...

6783
03:31:39,350 --> 03:31:42,130
No, you said 20 subs to me and Tempo.

6784
03:31:43,090 --> 03:31:44,170
Yeah, I'll do it.

6785
03:31:45,590 --> 03:31:47,170
Wait, I can't gift Tempo subs.

6786
03:31:48,090 --> 03:31:48,690
Wait, what?

6787
03:31:48,750 --> 03:31:50,310
Are you not even an affiliate, Tempo?

6788
03:31:50,510 --> 03:31:51,070
No, I can't.

6789
03:31:51,130 --> 03:31:51,270
I can't.

6790
03:31:52,210 --> 03:31:54,630
Alright, 20 gifted to Tempo.

6791
03:31:56,810 --> 03:31:58,310
Wait, gift one sub when I run.

6792
03:31:58,310 --> 03:32:00,930
20 subs is $100.

6793
03:32:01,930 --> 03:32:03,190
We got five kills?

6794
03:32:03,670 --> 03:32:04,830
Yeah, you got five?

6795
03:32:05,190 --> 03:32:05,750
You got five?

6796
03:32:06,010 --> 03:32:07,510
We have five kills.

6797
03:32:07,830 --> 03:32:09,270
We have five kills.

6798
03:32:09,330 --> 03:32:11,950
I don't know whose kills these are.

6799
03:32:12,110 --> 03:32:13,410
I have an interview with the winners.

6800
03:32:13,550 --> 03:32:14,270
I have no idea what's going on.

6801
03:32:14,270 --> 03:32:14,990
Wait, can we join?

6802
03:32:15,970 --> 03:32:16,970
I'll ask them.

6803
03:32:18,650 --> 03:32:19,690
I'll ask them too.

6804
03:32:20,870 --> 03:32:21,430
Oh no.

6805
03:32:21,850 --> 03:32:23,890
We'll just be like, hey, we're gonna be here to help interview.

6806
03:32:24,970 --> 03:32:25,730
I'll see, I'll see.

6807
03:32:28,150 --> 03:32:30,350
We just fucking crashed the interview.

6808
03:32:34,950 --> 03:32:37,250
By the way, Tempo, I made up that number.

6809
03:32:37,350 --> 03:32:38,830
I don't even know how many kills you got.

6810
03:32:39,030 --> 03:32:40,810
Yeah, I don't know how many kills we got.

6811
03:32:41,010 --> 03:32:43,630
I see total kills as five, so...

6812
03:32:43,630 --> 03:32:46,690
So four, we'll stay with five.

6813
03:32:46,750 --> 03:32:47,730
We'll stay with five.

6814
03:32:47,790 --> 03:32:49,250
It says total kills.

6815
03:32:49,570 --> 03:32:50,090
He doesn't know.

6816
03:32:50,510 --> 03:32:52,170
He's not gonna fact check.

6817
03:32:55,790 --> 03:32:56,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6818
03:32:56,930 --> 03:32:57,370
Yeah.

6819
03:33:00,010 --> 03:33:01,430
So five kills, right?

6820
03:33:02,310 --> 03:33:04,150
That's 25 subs for you!

6821
03:33:05,530 --> 03:33:06,390
It's payday!

6822
03:33:07,650 --> 03:33:08,450
Okay, we're back.

6823
03:33:08,690 --> 03:33:09,930
What is Wig gonna do?

6824
03:33:09,970 --> 03:33:10,870
Review the VOD?

6825
03:33:11,170 --> 03:33:11,630
Exactly.

6826
03:33:14,930 --> 03:33:16,990
She's not gonna review the VOD.

6827
03:33:18,330 --> 03:33:23,410
Guys, I don't think Wig's gonna... I don't think he's coming back, guys.

6828
03:33:23,550 --> 03:33:25,830
I think he's gonna come back, but the interview's gonna be over.

6829
03:33:25,830 --> 03:33:28,310
He didn't bring us back to the room.

6830
03:33:28,770 --> 03:33:30,230
I can't believe it.

6831
03:33:31,990 --> 03:33:35,090
I can't believe he didn't bring us into the interview room.

6832
03:33:35,270 --> 03:33:36,110
He left us!

6833
03:33:36,190 --> 03:33:37,090
That's so fucked up!

6834
03:33:37,330 --> 03:33:40,350
He's about to interview now.

6835
03:33:40,630 --> 03:33:41,650
That's fucked up!

6836
03:33:41,670 --> 03:33:43,130
He didn't even tell us!

6837
03:33:43,350 --> 03:33:46,050
He didn't drag us in!

6838
03:33:46,230 --> 03:33:47,550
He didn't drag us in!

6839
03:33:48,270 --> 03:33:49,310
Oh my god!

6840
03:33:50,890 --> 03:33:53,150
He actually just went peace!

6841
03:33:53,970 --> 03:33:55,210
And left us!

6842
03:33:58,640 --> 03:34:00,640
I'm gonna message him.

6843
03:34:00,760 --> 03:34:01,920
Shake my head.

6844
03:34:02,100 --> 03:34:03,720
Actually left us.

6845
03:34:08,280 --> 03:34:10,300
Shake my head.

6846
03:34:13,240 --> 03:34:14,800
Can't believe it.

6847
03:34:16,720 --> 03:34:18,480
He left for milk.

6848
03:34:22,380 --> 03:34:24,620
He actually left us.

6849
03:34:26,620 --> 03:34:28,360
We're like the only one...

6850
03:34:28,360 --> 03:34:29,380
Oh wait, no, actually I was gonna say...

6851
03:34:29,380 --> 03:34:32,900
I thought we were like the only one in VC, but we can only see our own VCs.

6852
03:34:36,950 --> 03:34:38,610
Yeah, and then the one above us.

6853
03:34:39,050 --> 03:34:41,470
We can click into the...

6854
03:34:41,470 --> 03:34:42,250
Oh no, nevermind.

6855
03:34:42,430 --> 03:34:43,630
We can't click.

6856
03:34:48,600 --> 03:34:50,160
Guys, we doubled...

6857
03:34:50,160 --> 03:34:52,480
We doubled Greek's score.

6858
03:34:52,900 --> 03:34:54,420
Did we double Greek's score?

6859
03:34:54,640 --> 03:34:56,600
Guys, we doubled Greek's score!

6860
03:34:56,760 --> 03:34:57,800
We doubled his score.

6861
03:35:00,660 --> 03:35:02,100
Guys, we did it!

6862
03:35:02,100 --> 03:35:06,380
We're better than the rank one Pred last season.

6863
03:35:06,720 --> 03:35:07,980
Just remember that!

6864
03:35:08,380 --> 03:35:09,480
Any team...

6865
03:35:09,480 --> 03:35:12,180
We're better than the team that was...

6866
03:35:12,180 --> 03:35:13,940
that had a rank one Pred.

6867
03:35:18,440 --> 03:35:19,800
That's all it takes.

6868
03:35:20,960 --> 03:35:22,320
Oh my god.

6869
03:35:22,920 --> 03:35:24,360
Look, last look...

6870
03:35:24,360 --> 03:35:26,560
It's cause the current season doesn't have rank one yet.

6871
03:35:26,600 --> 03:35:28,920
We don't know who's the current rank one Pred yet this season.

6872
03:35:29,300 --> 03:35:30,460
We don't know.

6873
03:35:32,600 --> 03:35:35,420
We don't know, so it doesn't matter, chat.

6874
03:35:36,500 --> 03:35:38,280
Yeah, cause it hasn't ended yet.

6875
03:35:38,600 --> 03:35:38,980
We're the...

6876
03:35:40,440 --> 03:35:41,400
God's strongest...

6877
03:35:41,400 --> 03:35:41,760
Did it end yet?

6878
03:35:41,760 --> 03:35:42,220
No, it didn't.

6879
03:35:42,240 --> 03:35:42,640
What do you mean?

6880
03:35:42,680 --> 03:35:43,440
The season's still ongoing.

6881
03:35:44,040 --> 03:35:45,420
Is rank season still ongoing?

6882
03:35:45,720 --> 03:35:45,760
Oh, right.

6883
03:35:45,760 --> 03:35:46,920
It ends next week.

6884
03:35:47,020 --> 03:35:47,260
Yeah.

6885
03:35:47,480 --> 03:35:48,420
It's still ongoing.

6886
03:35:48,920 --> 03:35:50,000
Okay, so we're good.

6887
03:35:50,180 --> 03:35:50,740
We're good.

6888
03:35:51,180 --> 03:35:52,340
We're good to go.

6889
03:35:58,980 --> 03:36:01,000
You know, I think we did pretty well.

6890
03:36:01,240 --> 03:36:03,980
I think we did pretty well as a team.

6891
03:36:04,120 --> 03:36:04,680
I had...

6892
03:36:04,680 --> 03:36:06,640
I had zero expectations.

6893
03:36:07,060 --> 03:36:09,320
I still have zero expectations, but...

6894
03:36:11,420 --> 03:36:14,480
I thought we were gonna get in the middle.

6895
03:36:14,920 --> 03:36:15,660
I know.

6896
03:36:15,700 --> 03:36:16,960
It wasn't gonna happen.

6897
03:36:17,040 --> 03:36:17,560
I know.

6898
03:36:18,360 --> 03:36:19,480
I mean...

6899
03:36:19,480 --> 03:36:22,200
With our POIs, there was no way.

6900
03:36:22,360 --> 03:36:24,680
Like, literally, we had zero good POIs.

6901
03:36:25,760 --> 03:36:28,760
Wig literally got kicked out of all the good POIs.

6902
03:36:28,920 --> 03:36:34,060
The last Twitch Rivals we did, Wig actually had decent places to land.

6903
03:36:34,060 --> 03:36:34,100
Yeah.

6904
03:36:34,160 --> 03:36:34,460
Yeah.

6905
03:36:34,460 --> 03:36:34,660
Yeah.

6906
03:36:34,680 --> 03:36:36,060
We actually had loot.

6907
03:36:36,060 --> 03:36:36,660
Let's see if they...

6908
03:36:36,660 --> 03:36:37,600
That's true.

6909
03:36:37,760 --> 03:36:37,920
Let's...

6910
03:36:37,920 --> 03:36:38,100
Yeah.

6911
03:36:38,180 --> 03:36:38,480
We were...

6912
03:36:38,480 --> 03:36:38,900
We were what?

6913
03:36:39,060 --> 03:36:39,460
Grow towers?

6914
03:36:39,840 --> 03:36:40,740
We had loot.

6915
03:36:40,880 --> 03:36:41,000
Yeah.

6916
03:36:41,100 --> 03:36:43,720
We had actual loot and we weren't getting contested.

6917
03:36:44,040 --> 03:36:45,480
This time, we...

6918
03:36:45,480 --> 03:36:47,980
We got contested every time.

6919
03:36:48,040 --> 03:36:48,920
Or not every time.

6920
03:36:49,020 --> 03:36:49,440
We...

6921
03:36:49,440 --> 03:36:51,140
We got kicked out of our areas.

6922
03:36:52,120 --> 03:36:52,980
What is POI?

6923
03:36:53,200 --> 03:36:54,000
It's like...

6924
03:36:54,000 --> 03:36:55,260
I forgot what...

6925
03:36:55,260 --> 03:36:57,080
What's the abbreviation for POI?

6926
03:36:58,500 --> 03:36:59,740
It's like the landmarks.

6927
03:36:59,740 --> 03:37:00,440
So where you're landing.

6928
03:37:00,660 --> 03:37:02,360
I don't know what the abbreviation is.

6929
03:37:02,440 --> 03:37:02,760
I forgot.

6930
03:37:03,260 --> 03:37:03,680
POI?

6931
03:37:03,700 --> 03:37:03,880
Point of interest.

6932
03:37:04,160 --> 03:37:04,660
Oh, POI.

6933
03:37:04,680 --> 03:37:05,100
POI.

6934
03:37:05,100 --> 03:37:05,720
Point of interest.

6935
03:37:05,880 --> 03:37:08,740
So it's basically where teams get to pick where you want to land.

6936
03:37:08,800 --> 03:37:09,700
The landmarks and stuff.

6937
03:37:10,140 --> 03:37:12,620
And then we tried to pick good spots.

6938
03:37:13,100 --> 03:37:15,180
But then every other team kicked us out.

6939
03:37:16,480 --> 03:37:19,100
Every team kicked us out of the spots.

6940
03:37:19,480 --> 03:37:20,060
So all...

6941
03:37:20,060 --> 03:37:25,480
So we got the spots that were considered like absolutely trash loot with zero...

6942
03:37:25,480 --> 03:37:26,820
With zero hope.

6943
03:37:27,280 --> 03:37:28,140
He's weak.

6944
03:37:28,200 --> 03:37:29,240
He's a little bitch.

6945
03:37:37,160 --> 03:37:38,240
Oh my god.

6946
03:37:38,740 --> 03:37:39,260
This...

6947
03:37:39,260 --> 03:37:41,120
I don't even know how long this interview is gonna be.

6948
03:37:42,180 --> 03:37:43,640
How long is this interview?

6949
03:37:46,400 --> 03:37:47,480
It just started.

6950
03:37:47,840 --> 03:37:49,540
Wait, they just started the interview?

6951
03:37:50,240 --> 03:37:50,720
Yeah.

6952
03:37:51,280 --> 03:37:52,140
Oh no.

6953
03:37:52,280 --> 03:37:52,700
They a...

6954
03:37:52,700 --> 03:37:53,360
Oh my god.

6955
03:37:53,380 --> 03:37:54,600
They just started the interview.

6956
03:37:59,330 --> 03:38:00,470
Oh my god.

6957
03:38:01,490 --> 03:38:02,730
I can't believe it.

6958
03:38:02,770 --> 03:38:03,830
How long are we gonna be waiting here?

6959
03:38:07,810 --> 03:38:09,550
Yeah, the interview just started now.

6960
03:38:10,270 --> 03:38:13,710
Okay, if this interview is gonna take really, really, really long.

6961
03:38:13,710 --> 03:38:15,130
I might peace out soon.

6962
03:38:22,080 --> 03:38:24,540
I think it takes like 15...

6963
03:38:24,540 --> 03:38:25,720
Fifteen minutes?

6964
03:38:26,320 --> 03:38:27,240
Four and a...

6965
03:38:27,240 --> 03:38:28,520
All right GGs Tempo.

6966
03:38:28,620 --> 03:38:30,900
Tell Wig that I couldn't wait 15 minutes.

6967
03:38:31,240 --> 03:38:33,960
I couldn't wait...

6968
03:38:37,720 --> 03:38:38,260
GGs.....

6969
03:38:40,120 --> 03:38:41,520
I have zero patience.

6970
03:38:41,680 --> 03:38:44,720
All right, GGs Tempo.

6971
03:38:44,720 --> 03:38:45,620
You have to do your schedule, right?

6972
03:38:45,840 --> 03:38:46,740
Yeah, I have to do my schedule.

6973
03:38:46,740 --> 03:38:47,580
When did you want to play?

6974
03:38:47,860 --> 03:38:48,560
What do you mean?

6975
03:38:48,720 --> 03:38:48,900
I do it on Saturday.

6976
03:38:49,840 --> 03:38:51,420
When did you want to play ranked?

6977
03:38:51,580 --> 03:38:56,080
I think most likely I won't be streaming it because I also have another Apex tournament too, other than CC.

6978
03:38:56,400 --> 03:38:57,960
So I don't want to put too many Apex on.

6979
03:38:58,140 --> 03:39:00,940
I'll most likely just play off- like you guys can stream, but I'll play off stream.

6980
03:39:01,380 --> 03:39:01,740
Okay.

6981
03:39:02,480 --> 03:39:04,660
Wait, you mean the one tomorrow, right?

6982
03:39:04,880 --> 03:39:05,240
What?

6983
03:39:05,360 --> 03:39:06,480
No, not that, next week.

6984
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:11,360
I mean next week I have another Apex tournament other than the CC one.

6985
03:39:12,220 --> 03:39:12,800
Oh, really?

6986
03:39:13,080 --> 03:39:13,660
Okay, okay.

6987
03:39:13,680 --> 03:39:16,020
Yeah, it's not been announced yet so I can't really say much about it.

6988
03:39:16,140 --> 03:39:16,840
Oh, okay, gotcha.

6989
03:39:16,980 --> 03:39:17,320
Yeah, yeah.

6990
03:39:17,320 --> 03:39:17,440
Okay.

6991
03:39:17,780 --> 03:39:19,540
Alright, GG's.

6992
03:39:20,040 --> 03:39:22,820
Bye, I'll see you next- or no wait, I'll see you tomorrow.

6993
03:39:23,080 --> 03:39:24,280
Yeah, yeah, I'll see you tomorrow at finals.

6994
03:39:24,960 --> 03:39:25,580
Bye-bye.

6995
03:39:28,240 --> 03:39:29,760
Alright, alright, guys.

6996
03:39:30,640 --> 03:39:36,140
Uh, I'm gonna call it here because like I actually- I cannot wait 15 minutes.

6997
03:39:36,860 --> 03:39:42,640
I don't want to watch- I don't want to watch an interview for 15 minutes, guys.

6998
03:39:42,820 --> 03:39:46,180
I don't want to watch it, but I had a great time.

6999
03:39:46,420 --> 03:39:47,160
I had a great time.

7000
03:39:47,320 --> 03:39:48,680
I always love playing with Wig and Tempo.

7001
03:39:48,880 --> 03:39:50,820
Um, we're just like fucking around.

7002
03:39:52,720 --> 03:39:55,960
I had very low expectations and it's not last.

7003
03:39:56,180 --> 03:39:57,040
I'm fine with that.

7004
03:39:57,280 --> 03:39:57,720
I'm fine.

7005
03:39:57,760 --> 03:39:59,180
We beat the rank one Fred team.

7006
03:39:59,480 --> 03:40:00,620
That's fine with me.

7007
03:40:00,800 --> 03:40:02,080
I'm happy with that.

7008
03:40:04,700 --> 03:40:08,540
The fact that we weren't last is good enough for me.

7009
03:40:08,680 --> 03:40:09,940
It's good enough for me.

7010
03:40:10,240 --> 03:40:12,620
Um, but it was honestly- it was really fun.

7011
03:40:12,920 --> 03:40:16,460
Um, yeah, it exceeded my very, very low expectations.

7012
03:40:18,360 --> 03:40:21,120
Um, and I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

7013
03:40:21,500 --> 03:40:26,640
Um, uh, if you're new here, I usually stream on the YouTubes.

03:40:34,020 --> 03:40:38,980
