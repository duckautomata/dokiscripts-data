1
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:25,180
well hello you know I felt like it'd be a bit awkward because like the official start is actually at 10 a.m.

2
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:46,700
but like we're supposed to have a waiting room for 30 minutes I feel like it'd be awkward to have you guys just watch this for 30 minutes so hello I decided to warn you guys up yeah we still got we still got 25 I I feel like it'd be a bit weird to have you guys just watched this for 25 minutes.

3
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,560
That's why I'm here.

4
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,160
I'm here.

5
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,920
I'm here to hang out.

6
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,040
Hang out before...

7
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,060
Well, I mean, technically, this is still sponsored dokey.

8
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,920
But we'll hang out for, I guess, 25 more minutes before sponsor, sponsor dokey is there.

9
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,000
Good morning, everyone.

10
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,120
Good morning.

11
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,240
I want to say first off, thank you to PUBG for sponsoring this stream.

12
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,800
But yes, if you guys want to help out this stream, you can see...

13
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,180
scan this QR code and do a survey.

14
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,440
Apparently there's a lot of stuff.

15
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,760
It's about like what you guys feel about this game from watching the stream.

16
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,780
So like after the stream or even like during the stream.

17
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,620
Maybe you guys can do the survey scan this code or click on the link pinned in my chat.

18
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,640
It does help out a lot.

19
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,700
You see me looking to my left is because that's where you guys are.

20
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,060
My third monitor.

21
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,080
My third monitor doesn't work.

22
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
Wait, because the command's not working.

23
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,680
My staff said they set up the commands, but let me double check real quick.

24
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,600
But yes, we only have one mod today.

25
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,200
So let me double check.

26
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,620
Did they...

27
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,220
Oh, you know what they did?

28
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,320
You know what they did, Silent?

29
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,920
They put it on my YouTube nightbox.

30
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,860
That's why it's not working.

31
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,440
They put it on my YouTube Nightbot because I have two Nightbots.

32
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,060
So, I think this is.

33
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,120
Let me double check.

34
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:22,740
Wait.

35
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,540
Oh, JK.

36
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,360
I lied.

37
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,840
It's my Twitch one.

38
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,660
Ha, JK.

39
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,740
They just forgot to do the command.

40
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,580
Oh, wait.

41
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,520
Oh, JK.

42
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,080
Um, JK.

43
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,420
Um, they just put in.

44
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,380
It's, it's, we're actually on my Twitch one.

45
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,800
I'm sorry.

46
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,080
It's so confusing when I have two Nightbots.

47
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,800
Uh, it's so confusing.

48
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,480
Okay, um, it's just silent use the wrong goddamn command.

49
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,340
I can't swear by the way to stream It's a rollercoaster guys.

50
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,780
It's 930 JK to that JK.

51
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,040
It's just my mind use the wrong command.

52
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,200
So it messed with me It messed with me.

53
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,240
It's on my phone

54
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,280
It's it's never the streamers fun

55
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm JKception No, no, no It's never my fault So yes, it used the Command exclamation point PUBG But yes, it's not the usual PUBG game It's actually a new game Into the PUBG series So it's a top Down tactical shooter So you know how like when you have to like I mean,

56
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,980
they have different modes.

57
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,100
They have Team Deathmatch.

58
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,540
Also, the usual one where you have to plan a bomb or use the bomb.

59
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,820
And then when you're in defense, it's like you have to fortify walls.

60
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,280
You know, like those types of top-down tactical shooters.

61
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,660
Like, you have to fortify walls.

62
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,420
And then you can breach.

63
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,020
Like breaching.

64
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,120
And then, boom.

65
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,720
I'll show you guys.

66
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,300
We don't have to show the tutorial.

67
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,320
But I'll show you guys the tutorial.

68
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,120
So you guys give the sense.

69
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,320
I mean, I have like...

70
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,280
We have an hour...

71
00:09:13,820 --> 00:10:18,960
before like we get into the discord to do the 2v2 so i'll show you guys the tutorial because i'm not as well you know like show you guys the gameplay of it um um but yeah no i i tried it out in tutorial and we did like custom games to like try get our feeling good but there's like different characters and stuff like different characters give like different utils um so like one character can have like uh okay like during like rehearsal like it's oh my gosh like so i'll be team up moxie um we're gonna 2v2 and i'm a little bit i'm a little bit nervous i'm a little bit shy but anyway uh moxie wasn't there for the tech rehearsal so it was just me versus two other people and like it was like you know versus the other two streamers and like it was just like i would kill one and then the other person would just have a shotgun i'm like what do i do and they just like i'm like i did it i got i got my one but i had to get two I kill it and it's like pop pop and when I've been pop pop it was like

72
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:27,500
pop and then I'm dead I got I got I got to get my twos not get my one

73
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,760
um um yeah so like literally just pop and I'm dead I was like I got shotgun

74
00:10:43,820 --> 00:12:04,560
it's a very um i i got it okay then you think i could defense defend a 1v2 i just they just run at me i was just i was just like whatever like attack was a lot attacking maybe i almost i almost got at least one point in attacking like um i didn't know my camping spots yet like you know how like dirt used usually in defusal and defense and offense like when you're doing defense um um it's all about like finding the spot to camp so that no one will but it's i feel like it's a little bit more um you have to be more tactical a bit when it's you know a tactical shooter um because like um because it's a top down so like i feel like you gotta figure out like use your head to be like which one which one um which would be the easiest like spot that like the ash can't see in a top down scenario but also didn't have that you know they were two so they could just they threw in the sonar and it did it did it they just threw in a sonar into that room i was like oh yes i die i they know where i am

75
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,020
But I've tried my best.

76
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,860
But like I said, it's third person, because it is top down.

77
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,420
So it's like a top view.

78
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,500
So there's a lot of strategies.

79
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,320
There's a lot of weapons.

80
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,260
Like I said, there was like SMGs.

81
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,580
There was sniper shotgun.

82
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,960
There was like grenade launcher.

83
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,640
There was like a top.

84
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,400
One of the characters gave like toxic gas or something.

85
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,020
And then because I was trying to use that in the 1V2.

86
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,480
It sort of worked, dude.

87
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,980
I just threw in toxic gas.

88
00:12:37,000 --> 00:13:43,340
they couldn't see so it sort of worked you know um oh it's search and destroy i forgot what it's called it's basically called search and destroy so you know um there's team death match and um just hide bro there's team death match and search and destroy so you know like usually like the strategic uh play um in the usual like compared to traditional fps games and um um and i apparently you can see what your teammates are seeing um uh through the third third person view so it that's like you know that's a lot easier because when you're first person you don't really know where people are there is a ping system so i could be like there they are uh so yeah so it's very easy um for me it was very easy to get into i just like you know it's very simple and direct uh but yes again thank you again to pubg for the sponsor and if you could scan the qr code or click on the link uh link pinned in my chat and do the survey that will help the stream out a lot and help uh um help out pubg blind spot um

89
00:13:43,340 --> 00:14:23,260
also um we're technically i think we're broadcast at twitch con i think uh let me double check i could be like saying stuff on my ass right now technically the sponsor doesn't start until until 20 minutes this is a bonus it's technically we could just like run the starting soon uh and room um but i was just like you know i just want to hang out uh just want to hang out with you guys um but yes uh i believe it's let me double check just to be sure i'm not like you know lying

90
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:35,660
oh yes oh they broadcast it maybe they start broadcasting at 10 a.m but like um they have the They have a booth at TwitchCon at the moment.

91
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,400
So, um, we might be broadcast, um, at the booth itself as well.

92
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,760
Um, so, you know, you guys can say hi.

93
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,800
Okay, well, not right now, because I didn't, I forgot.

94
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,840
I didn't put you guys, um, I didn't put you guys on the screen right now, because it's the starting screen.

95
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,220
Um, but, like, you guys can say hi later.

96
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,440
You can say hi later when we swap screens.

97
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,280
Uh, but yeah, there was a lot of characters to choose from.

98
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,060
I like the artwork.

99
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:20,580
It's where it's pretty neat There was a I was, there was so many characters I didn't know which one to pick I guess I should pick the one with a shotgun Because I feel like, I don't know Unless I get a goddamn deagle headshot From 20 miles away I feel like,

100
00:15:20,700 --> 00:16:01,160
because like I feel like since it's a tactical shooter Like, you're always going to be close up You know, not like Not like far away So I have to be like super close up with someone so i feel you know if someone's gonna be breaching my walls like be like say hello to my shotgun pop pop um but only like certain characters uh carry shotgun so it'll be it'll be interesting to see i'm just gonna make sure you know i'll use this time to read through like um Make sure I don't miss out on anything

101
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:18,500
But yeah, I had to wake up super early Actually, okay, you know, I didn't I'm sorry, I still, I didn't You know how I was like, I'm going to get my I'm going to get my life together yesterday I went straight to bed

102
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,140
You know, to be fair, I did hydrate first

103
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:57,560
I was I was so okay to be fair I wanted to do some little some little rinkeroos at first but then I was just like I should sleep I knew if I get started on some rinkeroos um I would not wake up so I did get my life together I technically technically I did get my life together if you think about it because I technically did go to sleep early.

104
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,580
I actually went to sleep early.

105
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,180
A whole one in the morning early.

106
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,800
No, I did.

107
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,480
I slept at one in the morning.

108
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,860
That is so early for me.

109
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,660
If you think about it in the East Coast, that would have been like four in the morning.

110
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,020
So I technically stayed up on the other side of the world.

111
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,980
I live on the West Coast, but technically if you think about it, my soul is still in New York City.

112
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,620
But to be fair, I had to get up.

113
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,180
I actually woke up naturally at 8 in the morning.

114
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,640
Wait, was it?

115
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,800
At like, I think 8 in the morning, I naturally woke up.

116
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,300
I don't say I got really worried because I didn't set up any alarm.

117
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,600
And I was like, I'll let my body decide my face.

118
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,660
I like to do a little gamble and be like, my body will decide.

119
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,100
If I wake up in time for the sponsor,

120
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,600
my body will figure it out.

121
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,680
It's the risk, you know, the risk of it.

122
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,780
Yeah, my body chooses my fate today.

123
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,240
That's a bold strategy.

124
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,780
So I was just like, that's it.

125
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,960
What a power.

126
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,080
But it worked.

127
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,680
It worked.

128
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,420
I woke up at 8 in the morning.

129
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,180
It worked.

130
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,940
The great spirit guides my hand.

131
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,540
See, I am in control of my life.

132
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,760
The thrill of the gotcha.

133
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,000
Waking up or not.

134
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
You're so...

135
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,460
Okay, it's because I believed in myself, guys.

136
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,620
I believed in myself.

137
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,940
I knew my body won't betray me.

138
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,420
I had fate.

139
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,740
You just gotta believe in yourself.

140
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,760
And it worked.

141
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,560
I was here on time.

142
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,960
I made it.

143
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,260
I made it in everything.

144
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,900
I still don't know what to stream after.

145
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,500
I'm still trying to figure it out.

146
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,500
Oh yeah, no.

147
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,740
When Dad comes back.

148
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,220
I don't know.

149
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,560
I don't know if I'll continue streaming something on Twitch.

150
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,760
Or if I...

151
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:52,740
um if i'll uh go on because i don't know what to say because you know how i was gonna figure it out after yesterday's stream but then i was like you know i didn't figure it out i just went straight to bed oh he comes back on sunday i i was like you know i said i was like something came up i can i i pick him up on sunday and they did no questions asked they didn't ask any questions

152
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:24,140
another another little thing I want to say but thank you again to puppy for the sponsor um this was like uh for me um I had to like like everything was finalized for me for this sponsor like I think like yesterday or like day before yesterday um um so that's why like everyone's like whoa what you guys sponsored to be fair I am um um I say I always say I say yes to a lot of stuff because

153
00:20:27,180 --> 00:21:45,180
but it's interesting it's pubg too so um it'll be i thought it would be really interesting because it is also um pubg um and um and is a new game in the franchise um i think we do have other pubg games i wonder um other than the pubg other than pubg um but uh i thought it'd be interesting because it is i don't play a lot of tactical shooters i don't play a lot especially like top i don't know i don't i usually don't play a lot of tactical shooters so it'll be very interesting but it is top down so i figured like you know i could see more so i don't get camped out more in other tactical shooters so like that's what i'm hoping for um if we get absolutely shit on then like that's all right you know that's on us that's that's on us but like you know um uh how how me and moxie would do um apparently later on uh viewers would be able to join us later i don't know if it'd be like viewers at twitch con or uh you like viewers here in our chat um but there is a 4v4 later uh so i'm not unsure

154
00:21:45,180 --> 00:22:55,240
right now if it's like 4v4 with you guys like the people in the chat um because it the game isn't out yet the game isn't out yet so i'm unsure at the moment but uh i think we're gonna be uh is it like is it can you is there early access let me double check um let me double check uh pub g blind spot let's see oh yeah yeah so uh yeah it's a new game um so um i'm not sure how at the moment how viewers would be able to i suppose it is with people now it's a San Diego go to the poopy like guys we see you guys still have time you have an hour and 10 minutes to get to San Diego TwitchCon and to play with us getting on the place mama need a hurry I didn't get there in an hour and in 20 minutes I can play with my OSCE and I'm just wait please just wait a bit

155
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,960
Do you think I'll make it from Amsterdam?

156
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,400
I think it's possible.

157
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:11,240
I think if you buy it, if you get on the plane within the next 30 minutes, I think that's like close enough, right?

158
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,000
San Diego is like an hour away from Amsterdam.

159
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:15,940
I'm pretty sure.

160
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,760
I'm not very good at geography, but that seems right.

161
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,360

$50.

166
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,340
$50 American dollars.

167
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,900
Imagine how much that is in other currency.

168
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,380
Imagine that $50 dollars.

169
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,860
But don't convert it to Euro.

170
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,300
like it's like or pounds because then it's less um

171
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:06,770
yeah as long as you don't convert it to euros or pounds we should be good uh but in like my canadian monopoly money um it's a lot

172
00:26:10,760 --> 00:27:31,300
uh let's see we have oh my god there he missed pass by so fast we have like three more minutes before I'll show you guys oh yeah we're we're I'll be showing you guys a couple of videos and also I'll show you guys the tutorial because like I said we have like a lot of time until we have to do the group matches and the team matches so um so I'll show you guys the tutorial so you get a sense of the game as well because I'm like like I have an hour before I think it's an hour before we get into the team matches but it's gonna be like 2v2 so me and moxie versus um emin and sunny and then uh um and then after that it's 4v4 i think it's 4v4 let me double check yeah it's team death match and then a casual match against like uh other like other people and then uh and then after that we have um we have viewer participation so so we have we people joining from the audience i assume it's at twitch gone because like i said um i i don't i it's it's not out yet the game isn't out so we're giving you

173
00:27:31,300 --> 00:28:21,900
guys a preview of what the game looks like um so this is like you know this is not really my first reaction um because i did check out the tutorial already and i did we did do like some practice games um so i sort of know like the basic i am trying to figure out like what i would like to do with a camera because it's actually really like three different camera systems one is manual because it's a top down one is like it follows your crosshair it follows your mouse movement and the other one is like it follows your like cross like when you're aiming down sight so um so like i have no i've been like bouncing between the one where i aim down sight where the camera moves when i aim down sight versus manual and i don't know manual like it's a lot more work yes it is third person it is third person i'm a little Because like,

174
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:39,340
I've The only times I've interacted with Moxie Was in a group scenario Group scenario so like, we're going to have Like, we're going to Like, I don't know, I'm always so nervous, you know Whenever, like I have to interact with someone new That's when we have to have like a group discussion To about this Game.

175
00:28:39,540 --> 00:30:15,600
So like, I'm just I'm just an introvert So I hope I hope like, you know I hope Moxie Doesn't think doesn't think I'm too silly I hope I'm not cringe that's it it's always the back of head oh god I hope I'm not cringe too late so um um so yeah I'm I'm a little okay I'm really nervous I'm always anything cringe don't do oh oh it's 10 all right all right it's 10 let's go solo gaming oh you see that the qr code is right there now all right let me uh let me make sure also um our sound guys sound team um isn't available so we have a mod that's gonna be a temporary sound guy for us today so good luck because you're also going to handle the discord stuff too but again thank you again for pubg for this sponsor i really appreciate it um we're gonna be checking out the i'll show you guys the tutorial because you know we still have like uh like i said before uh we do have quite a bit of time before we go into like the actual games itself um so sound guy let me know about the sound uh you are

176
00:30:15,600 --> 00:31:43,520
modded now so you can tell me and i might miss your chat his his reply just just like reply to him be like here so like the entire sound team um and the other minds are currently unfortunately not here so this is his first very his first big boy job to sound balance um a sponsor stream um yes like i said it is third person so let me let me grab real quick bump bump bump all right so here you see pubg blind spot i'll show you guys the characters like i said there's like there's um apex so like you can see oh my gosh you can't see i was like as you guys can see it is util oh sorry oh wait oh nice cactus is here too um um i was told that uh outlaw was gonna be the only mod there so like that's good to know that there is another um but as you guys can't see let me let me like here you go um here you go i'll i'll disappear for a second so you guys can see there's like you know um there's like different um different types of uh weapons and utile that each character has i don't i don't know i

177
00:31:43,520 --> 00:33:06,280
feel like whichever one has the shotgun would be the best one so like goldberg red chip amplifier um increasing their move oh this is like a movement boost your sticky bomb okay that's not a shotgun there's explosive hammer um this is early access by the way so things could change obviously um yeah they all have like set util so um this guy looks cool this guy looks like uh looks like a um you know like a spy villain uh there's patch she's cute i like her not because she has cat okay because she has cat girl ears it is absolutely because of it yeah um i tried using her but like the med kit took so to be fair i was 1v2ing so the med kit took so long to deploy so i think if i had you know an actual teammate it would have been a lot easier but i'll show you guys i'll show you guys a tutorial so um So this is the one thing so you can see like I can this is manual camera So I'm like trying to figure out I want to do manual because like when I aim The camera doesn't move so like I set the so

178
00:33:06,280 --> 00:34:20,700
it's just that But like But like then there's like okay this one I did not like this one was like it's too much So whenever you move your mouse because I feel like it moves way too much like I don't get motion sickness but I don't like this type I personally didn't like this camera um just because like it's just too much movement and um but then there's also this one so I'm debating between this or this one where um we don't move the camera but when you aim down sight you move the camera so like I don't know I don't know which one I would do um I have no idea yet because like both of them are are like but then feel like it's gonna mess up my aim maybe um so like i'm gonna try i don't know i'll do manual for now because like for rotating my camera it's my middle mouse button so like it doesn't seem that natural is there hipfire uh no there is and you have to aim downside um so you also change from headshot with your mouse you can rebind anything um i think more consistent will be

179
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,180
better.

180
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,040
That's the thing I don't know.

181
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,240
I don't know which is good.

182
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:31,760
Um, I don't know what would be a good camera to use.

183
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,320
Okay, and then here you can aim, you shoot the feet below.

184
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,940
I'll re-bind in my control.

185
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,360
So the thing you see on the, you see on tutorial is like different.

186
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,960
Uh, but yeah, I'm not sure, honestly.

187
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,360
Maybe I should.

188
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,660
Should I use this?

189
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,620
I'll try this.

190
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,130
I re-binded everything.

191
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,090
Alright, and then we got...

192
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:57,550
Breach!

193
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,530
I'm breaching!

194
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,910
Okay, I'm reloading.

195
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,110
But re-bind the key.

196
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,590
I don't know which key to re-bind, though, for the camera.

197
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,050
That's the thing.

198
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,230
I have no idea which would be good to re-bind.

199
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,750
Because this is me on...

200
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,610
Let's see.

201
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,630
Aim low to breach.

202
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:17,990
Oh, yeah.

203
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,390
I'm breaching.

204
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,710
Also, I could just do this.

205
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:27,890
I just made it I'm too lazy But it teaches you about mailing and stuff

206
00:35:31,310 --> 00:36:26,430
A thumb button Oh that's true Wait that is true Wait maybe I rebutted it to the thumb Okay Um where's the camera Align Rotate camera Where's my other Oh wait that's my aim low Fuck I use this to aim low So I don't know Maybe I have to readjust my controls then um i feel like i should use it for aim though let's see uh i'll do that and then i have to redo my aim look what the fuck do i sorry what the heck do i what the heck do i do for aim my bad it's pg 13 you get one um technically i get zero but Technically,

207
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:27,530
I can't see her.

208
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,210
PG-13, you get one.

209
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,350
Wait, where's the aim low, but aim down briefly?

210
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,410
Then what do I do for aim down briefly?

211
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,150
I guess I could try...

212
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,490
See?

213
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,830
I'll do that.

214
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:45,950
Apply.

215
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:49,690
Okay.

216
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,110
Wait, I should...

217
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,670
I feel like when will I ever shoot feet?

218
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,050
I don't know.

219
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,090
That's the thing.

220
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,610
When will I ever have to shoot the feet?

221
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:03,850
I don't know.

222
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,090
I still don't know which one I want to do.

223
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,250
Okay, so here's me barricading.

224
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,350
And then there's the hammer.

225
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:12,530
Breaching!

226
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:13,430
Oh!

227
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,170
There we go.

228
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,470
Breaching again!

229
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,170
Oh!

230
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,290
Alright.

231
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,790
Alright.

232
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,430
And then...

233
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,050
Oh yeah, grenade.

234
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,190
So...

235
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,330
Grenade.

236
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,070
Grenade.

237
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,030
Grenade out.

238
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,530
There ya.

239
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,050
All right.

240
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,570
And then I can change it if I just do scroll.

241
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,350
Grenade out.

242
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,310
Where's my grenade?

243
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,490
It said grenade.

244
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,710
Oh, there it is.

245
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:40,870
All right.

246
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,750
All right.

247
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,510
Breaching!

248
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,470
Boom!

249
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,530
What am I- I don't think I can use it on people.

250
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,370
I don't- I haven't tried it yet, but I mean, it'll be fun to see.

251
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,790
If I can- Oh.

252
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,790
If I can use it on people.

253
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,290
Is there like, oh there's like a cool down, a small cool down?

254
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,150
Because I tried to use it on this guy, but it didn't work.

255
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:03,890
JK, it worked.

256
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:13,110
Okay, the goal is to use the hammer on some, this is the goal.

257
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,750
We have a new goal.

258
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,350
I don't care if we lose.

259
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,710
I don't care if we lose, we gotta use the hammer on someone.

260
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:51,330
up someone will be stupid oh shit someone will be stupid enough oh no i feel like the hammer does have ammo where's the last one it's over here wall breach incoming i mean it does say six but like objective completed yeah it's the tfim moment okay this is a lot harder than tfim There's actual,

261
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,730
like, pullback tab.

262
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,270
I feel like, guys, I have a feeling this might be hard.

263
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:01,830
Oh, wait.

264
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:02,890
Oh, wait.

265
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,850
Our sound guy's actually here.

266
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,250
Okay, there we go.

267
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,770
Sound guy nothing.

268
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:08,370
There we go.

269
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,310
Sound team is actually here.

270
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:17,970
Look, I was told, look, sound guy, I was told by one of the other mods that you were not going to wake up.

271
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:25,710
It was not, I mean, I was just told the information that I was given.

272
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,290
So, but yeah, sound guy.

273
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,830
Just feel free to tell me about the sound in our screen.

274
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,550
That's what you meant, Annabelle.

275
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:43,250

I hope it is yeah all right this is like a character trailer whoa also drop out oh yeah this is the character we look at her she's four to five i'll make sure it doesn't loop though oh yeah that's the green that's the toxic gas i was talking about i tried to use that in a 1v2 scenario it um did not work out for me because also like oh what was funny was that oh she's cute what was funny was that i didn't realize you know search and destroy there's two points so i like i like fenced up point a and i was like i got this and then they're like they're like um diffusal like the the encryption key has been planted and i was like where i didn't look i was like there's a b spy so i was like obviously as a solo person in a one v2 um it was not ideal for me did she did it I absolutely did not know

299
00:42:56,550 --> 00:44:15,690
yeah so I definitely did not know not my spot not my the problem is is that both spots were my spots but no the character ability seemed really cool I can't wait to try out all the other abilities like i said are all the other like weapons that the characters have um because i said there's a lot lots of characters and a lot of different utils and stuff all right here's the next one this is one where we all go uh of a live streamer oh it's a live streamer tournament and then five and okay so these are like actual good players playing this game not like me not like me i don't know what i'm doing for us btk you're holding yeah so there's the yeah this is like what we are i um wish we could do side flank but btk master is waiting for it he keeps looking over in that direction but hadn't spotted him yeah because i have to oh my gosh i gotta be like um i'm so bad with you too i'm sorry moxie good luck so i'm so i feel like we're gonna get like dunked on I'm so bad with you,

303
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:21,610
Good luck, Moxie.

304

00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,710
You think I could just, like, run up?

307
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:31,070
Oh, we have a guy to sneak up to someone.

308
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,410
Because, like, you know, it's third person.

309
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,530
They can't see from behind.

310
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,550
So if I can sneak up to someone from behind.

311
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:37,750
Got one.

312
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:38,410

313
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:39,890
Oh, my God.

314
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,310
Like, they see one tiny thing.

315
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,310
What's in the MIP?

316
00:44:45,090 --> 00:45:08,050
Yeah, that blue thing damages people I believe in Moxie I believe in Moxie, he's a gamer Oh my god, this guy Okay, that's okay You did not need to sacrifice your life to plant that bomb I'll be in the blind spot That's right

317
00:45:12,110 --> 00:46:12,910
No, I'll do the charge up behind them before they they can see me oh and then they have to crouch and everything that was a good first message roll the credit i still don't know what camera angle to use best thank you again the pubg blind spot for the sponsor i really appreciate it uh uh all right so sound team said there's no adjustments yet okay good we're gonna you're gonna have to start we're good luck with adjusting when we're in the voice call though good luck it's that's always the hard part when you have to do the vc adjustments um okay let me double check okay they're like technically in the vc but like we're not supposed to do anything yet so i don't have to go in um I don't know,

318
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,050
I'm like, there's a shooting range.

319
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,090
I don't know, like, what character, okay, who?

320
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:18,790
Shotgun.

321
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,130
Has to be a shotgun.

322
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,490
Uh, the motion detector.

323
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,370
Oh my god, explosive hammer.

324
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,170
Oh my god.

325
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,670
Wait, I know what character to use.

326
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,610
This is it.

327
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,530
Boom, there you go.

328
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,090
I don't know.

329
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:40,910
We smashed.

330
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:41,690
This is the smash.

331
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:42,490
Okay, but I do have a...

332
00:46:42,510 --> 00:47:14,210
shotgun see boom that's what i mean this guy this gun can like one shot like it was not fun i think like if you aim at the head maybe yeah if i was close enough it's hammer oh wait no audio oops give me a sec i gotta fix that it's because i muted it because we're watching that video but yeah i think if i aim the head maybe i can get like a one shot maybe I'll just be like,

333
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,190
I'll be like this.

334
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,090
I'll be like this.

335
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,050
And like, pop, pop.

336
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,750
Uh, here's the, here's the breach.

337
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:27,930
What is this, though?

338
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,090
And then grenade.

339
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,330
I'm so bad with using details.

340
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,630
I don't know how to grenade.

341
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,770
I like other people grenade for me.

342
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,430
Oh my god.

343
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:38,930
Okay, wait.

344
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,890
This is a really, really nasty spread.

345
00:47:44,650 --> 00:48:56,450
oh my god the the spread for this is a little weird okay yeah the spread for this can you all bounce i think i can let me check frag out yeah you can okay but the bounce isn't that it's not that much but you can it's it's it is bouncing it is bouncing it's just not like a big bounce but it does you know it i mean okay so but you can't do like a hide girl like that you can't do that and then i almost died but you know that is a possibility uh okay but how close can a grenade be to me before i die okay wait but like can i kill myself with this actually wait i don't know if it's like me i don't know if that's like me uh being in the training ground so like i always live with one hp yeah i just always live with one hp okay it's all right what about here okay so i have to be like here to not accidentally kill myself like

346
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:12,950
okay that's good to know i have to be here to make sure i don't you know kill myself with my grenades in game um apparently grenades hurt a lot it's crazy Isn't it?

347
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,150
Is that?

348
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:14,870
Fun fact!

349
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,430
If you stand next to a grenade, you might lose your legs.

350
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,210
Okay, more than just your legs.

351
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:24,090
A little fun fact.

352
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,910
You can hammer run plus grenades.

353
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,850
Oh my god, you're right!

354
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,350
Wait, I could be like...

355
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:34,070
You're right.

356
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,790
If I'm about to die, I chuck the grenade at my feet.

357
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,270
Oh my god, you're right.

358
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,230
Wait, I should do that.

359
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,330
If I knew I'm about to die, I'll just chuck the grenade at my feet.

360
00:49:42,350 --> 00:50:07,810
and then I'll be like it's over I'm gonna have all these plans and then I won't even execute any of them I could feel it I I know I would have all these fun plans and then like I don't I don't even get anything um and we die we both die I'm gonna forget it frame one hundred percent uh

361
00:50:11,010 --> 00:51:07,940
yeah oh I can slam here okay um i just want to use the shotgun characters okay so there's the motion sensor motion detector placed that place it okay i don't know the range for it i think like when you're on the enemy team you'll see the range for it but yeah oh yeah so like the first gun only does oh my there's okay there's so bm but where is it this guy so the goddamn one of um the fortnite there used this uh n pen and then like it was i killed it was a 1v1 because i killed uh i killed sunny and then um and then literally this guy just did this and he planted the bomb and i couldn't do anything about it he just he just i caught a person i

362
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:51,300
he actually and they're like because he already planted the bomb so like if i go diffuse he can do this and shoot me like he can just do this and shoot me if i if i like try and diffuse so i was i didn't have nades i used up all my nades that's the worst part i already used up all my nades when i was like breached like when i was trying to breach the goddamn point um so so i just stood i gave up i just stood there and just let the bomb kill me i i don't know you can have her i I feel like I'm gonna hammer the shield here,

363
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:51,660
doesn't I?

364
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,240
I don't know.

365
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,940
Maybe next time I see that, I'm gonna hammer the shield next time.

366
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,820
I I was just like, what do I do?

367
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:11,380
He's just standing there with a shield.

368
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,180
What do I do?

369
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,620
I feel like you could literally just watch.

370
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,680
Honestly, maybe that's the strat.

371
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,400
One guy, maybe I can, I...

372
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,340
Maybe that's the strat.

373
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,520
I go up, walk over there and just...

374
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,900
Okay, I gotta make sure, like, they don't have grenades.

375
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,780
But I could just walk up there and then Moxie can just shoot them all.

376
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,640
Because, like, I've tried nothing, I'm out of option.

377
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:35,760
Wait, can I shoot?

378
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,920
I don't think you can.

379
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,800
I don't know.

380
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,400
I should have shot the feet just to make sure.

381
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,640
But... No, he just... You know what you do when he walks behind me?

382
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,820
That's what I did!

383
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,440
I was like, okay, I'll just walk behind.

384
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,740
And then he just did this.

385
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,720
I don't think I could do.

386
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,000
I...

387
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,880
I tried.

388
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,420
I walked behind him!

389
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,160
He just did this!

390
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,100
He just...

391
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,520
Um...

392
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,240
So, I don't know.

393
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,680
Good luck, Voxy.

394
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,300
I believe in you.

395
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,660
Your greatest weakness of shield.

396
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,200
I mean, there is this guy.

397
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:18,800
What is this?

398
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,180
You two.

399
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:51,360
what did i do i'm going i'm hacking into the system uh oh wait does it say oh it doesn't say oh here it is uh court after each use oh increases the movement speed now do i put it in do i just walk around with this i'll be like don't worry guys i got you i just i just want don't worry maxi i got you i sat in a corner and i just like Charging.

400
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,660
I just stand here in the corner and feel like Charging.

401
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,000
Oh, and there.

402
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,600
I'm the hype man.

403
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,500
Can I, like, reset it?

404
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,820
Okay, so, like, basically I do this.

405
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,600
And do I still...

406
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,160
Oh, I get...

407
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,860
Oh, okay, I don't have to hold it out.

408
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,600
That's good to know.

409
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,560
So, like, I basically...

410
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,000
Oh, my God.

411
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,620
It's so slow, though.

412
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,800
Oh, my God!

413
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,360
Bus someone!

414
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,240
Oh, my God!

415
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,080
That is so smart.

416
00:54:20,100 --> 00:55:49,440
we can buff it and then run in with a hammer wait i don't get a hammer here wait who i have to play this guy if i want to use the hammer all right so so moxie can use this i'll do this i'll be like buff me up and then i run in the the most important two seconds of my life i hammer time the hammer um i tried this person because i thought like oh i'm by myself let me just launch a grenade into it little did i know it's one bullet so my plan failed instantly um so so i was like i was like all right it's one v two i got this when they go plant the bomb i i use the grenade launcher into the play and then like um i tested it i was like testing it out like they we you know it was defense so i was testing it out and then it was and then like it was i realized wait where's it's one bullet because i was like i'm ready they breached it and then they're in the point i was like i'm ready and i was like i was like wait a minute where are the bullet wait a minute one bullet and no dream so that was a

417
00:55:49,440 --> 00:56:49,600
little oopsie that i did where i i i accidentally how bad is the flash okay it's not okay i know it's pretty bad it's pretty bad uh that's not supposed to happen i think it's more like the equipment and stuff that you see in uh uh pubg um but thank you again pubg for the sponsor feel free to do oh yeah feel free to do the survey scan the qr code or click on the link pinned in my chat i believe you can do the survey right now to what you feel about this game what's the drill oh i guess drill camera it's like you reach you start breaching oh wait that's cool oh wait it's two bullets oh that's cool this is like intel i could like if i'm breaching i could just why does this have three and my grenade launcher have like this is three and my grenade Lancer is one bullet.

418
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,520
Life's unfair, guys.

419
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,240
Smoke out.

420
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,440
Oh, here's the smoke.

421
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,640
Life's unfair.

422
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:56,360
Alright.

423
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,740
Smoke would be very important.

424
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,620
Life actually is unfair.

425
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,440
There's so many characters he is.

426
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,740
Oh my god, that recoil is insane.

427
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,380
You can only do, like, one bullet, I feel like, before things get messy.

428
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,900
You can't, you can't, like, continuously aim.

429
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,100
You actually have to, like, wait.

430
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,140
Wait, can I scan through smoke?

431
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:46,360
try well i don't know if i can try it for like my own team myself but um we'll see if it works and then i don't know okay go cam up oops i'm scanning the wrong side where's my drill camera guys the drill camera didn't didn't work okay i feel like maybe you can But I can't do it because I'm by myself Um

432
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:57,760
Okay here's the foam Foam grenades Look I can build my own wall I can build one wall

433
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:16,420
It's alright That one wall will clutch it Alright And then I can break my own wall I assume that breaks yeah that breaks it Uh my wall My one wall Okay The pistol odds can do headshots from what I've seen.

434
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,920
It's just the normal gun that does, like, regular...

435
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,060
Regular shots.

436
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,180
It's just a rig.

437
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,240
Just that...

438
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,360
Just body shots is a main gun.

439
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,780
And then the pistol is the...

440
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,560
You can change from headshot to body shot.

441
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,440
You can also do...

442
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,560
Feet shots, too.

443
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,620
But I don't know when...

444
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,920
When do I need to shoot the feet?

445
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:42,580
Like...

446
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,220
I don't know.

447
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,920
When will I ever need to shoot?

448
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:56,300
I guess like, oh, oh, oh, I forgot when you, when, you know, you breach the wall here and then you shoot the feet from that guy.

449
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,360
I realize, yeah, um, during shield.

450
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,700
All right, I'm going to test it.

451
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,740
I'm going to walk out with a shield and then we'll see if I die.

452
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,740
If they, if they know how to shoot the feet.

453
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,400
Let's see.

454
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,280
Let's see.

455
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,480
Well, we'll test that theory.

456
00:59:13,500 --> 01:00:13,800
out if I die then I know they can shoot the feet what's this uh explosive oh yeah explosive trap yeah does he was he the one yeah so this guy just has a shotgun as a main weapon so that's not fun at all but obviously this is for defense he seems so you just put that that also messed me up like literally just walk through and then oh yeah I guess like yeah you got the trap ready yeah so and then boom you die i guess but then you also get a shotgun which is life is unfair like you can use oh my god wait this guy is op wait this guy's op for uh for defense i can hit my main weapon has the headshot wait what's my grenade for this smoke out okay maybe i'll try collision i don't have to aim i just have to be like i i don't have to aim technically Okay,

457
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,260
this one.

458
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,700
Okay, this one I was like I'm going to heal myself.

459
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:21,060
And then like, it was just too much.

460
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,520
Too much prep time.

461
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,240
Like, I know it's like two seconds, but like, I was getting chased at.

462
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,920
Like, there was no prep time for me.

463
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,520
Oh my gosh.

464
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,580
Do I have anything that does damage?

465
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,200
No, the shotgun was so strong.

466
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,220
I tried to play air because I was like, oh, I can heal myself, you know?

467
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:40,440
Like, thinking that I can just heal myself.

468
01:00:40,840 --> 01:02:00,440
And then I was getting chased at by two people and then i was just like oh guess i no guess i don't no you have to let you walk when you start healing see that's that's way too much time like that's way too much time to grab a heal apparently in 15 minutes we're gonna do our 2v2 yeah um what else our last girl oh this one this one was she seems fun only because like um the thing is you can't really you can do this and and just like but also i messed up because i think it's also one bullet or two it depends on if you can grab ammo in time um but it doesn't last too long um um but it seemed really good for like you know they're at the point and you just like throw the gas out um you throw the gas out and then like hope everything will be okay you hope that they'll be there that's that's my hope uh yeah those are all the characters like i said there's so many different utils um so i don't know which one to use i don't know which would be the best one to use because there's just um it's

469
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:17,200
just so much util to to choose from um but yes please feel free to use the qr code um that's all displayed on the screen and um feel free to scan that or click on the link pinned in the chat again thank you again the PUBG for the sponsor.

470
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:17,940
Yay!

471
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,140
It's been fun checking this game out.

472
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,920
And say hello to the people at TwitchCon who are watching us right now.

473
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:26,880
Hello, everybody.

474
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:27,860
Hello, hello.

475
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,900
I'll be the DEF CAM player.

476
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:35,580
Hello, everyone.

477
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,080
We'll mostly be at the DEF CAM, but that's okay.

478
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,040
I believe in Moxie.

479
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,260
I don't know.

480
01:02:45,340 --> 01:03:17,560
I'm not like tactical shooters I'm sometimes I'm like not as confident only because like you have to be so patient and oh my god wait I don't know if moxie is patient but like I know I'm not patient you have to you're supposed to like you know sit down you know like sit here and wait but I'm like why wait when I can just run into the action but like but like that's not how you play tactical shooters so I need to like I need to sit here with my shotgun now and be like pop

481
01:03:20,940 --> 01:04:39,620
I like the yeah I just want to run into the bullet I can't help it I'm gonna try collision okay I'm gonna try oh it's because like when you're crouched they move slow but um here they move pretty fast I'm very self-aware of like what my uh what my uh what my strong points are I'm I'm not I'm gonna use manual camera for now if I don't feel if it if you know if it doesn't work I'll swap to like the aiming one but for now try the manual um what's the line camera oh oh oh you can like auto align the camera I don't know when you'll have to do that god I'm so nervous not the drive by pop pop I guess I'll just be in this corner in my little corner i assume like we have our own vcs wait actually what if we're doing 2v2 are you going to be like carrying the other team because i see one vc i see i just see one vc so i'm a little confused about that um let me ask will there be a separate vcs

482
01:04:44,480 --> 01:05:01,280
2v2 there you go yeah because I was like that's awkward if I could like hear they're like okay we're gonna do this and this and then I'm on the other team being like okay

483
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:16,620
I'll be like alright I guess they're gonna do this guys they're Or, um, yeah, one VC chaos.

484
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:20,280
I mean, I'd rather just do, like, these, like, separate VCs.

485
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:26,500
Or two V2, because I feel like that's a little bit too much.

486
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,120
All right.

487
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,880
There is in-game VC.

488
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,160
Um, where is it?

489
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,000
Yeah, push to talk.

490
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,540
I don't even know what my push to talk is.

491
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,620
I never had to for this game.

492
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:37,840
Oh, there you go.

493
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,180
Kio.

494
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:39,600
Hello.

01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,080
Oh, yes, it, nope.

496
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,080
We'll never know.

497
01:05:44,460 --> 01:06:44,580
all right here's the plan we're gonna try wilson and then moxie can aim i'll do this i'll be like i got you moxie and then he gets shot in the side but like it's the thought that counts you know like i i have a feeling um he's just gonna get shot in the side but it's the I did my best I know I did my best that's all that matters um that's all that matters oh yeah the shield has life it does but takes for ever it takes forever um wait I mean separate voice chats or are we going are are we going to hear the other team's comps during the 2v2

498
01:06:52,670 --> 01:07:04,310
there was a miscommunication alright I'll be here for the tank gameplay right here oh okay they made a new voice chat

499
01:07:08,150 --> 01:08:36,870
okay there you go okay there you go alright alright apparently I have to make the room I'll make the room right now all right custom game create game winners house uh this is a team death match all right copy all right got it i got the code there we go yeah i was gonna say it's awkward if we're all gonna share the uh we're all gonna share it and then like i'll be like hey guys hi i can oh we know their plan and now just type in chat what we do like i know because it's a tactical you know we gotta be tactical so i was just like god how do we need to out join the general all right i'm just gonna get the discord stuff going bum bum bum i'm just getting a discord stuff going right now wait can't connect i was gonna say how what do you mean you can't connect um what is this discord server called pubg blind spot all right i'm just getting the pubg thing set up uh and thank you again for the sponsor pubg i really appreciate it all right pubg blind spot there you go to be fair like wait where

500
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:49,750

501
01:08:53,590 --> 01:09:16,790
because i'm like oh all right there you go wait why is there why is it tech oh oh it's because they create a text channel oh that's funny that they're like but i was like wait wait a minute where's a voice channel.

Uh, one team, both teams has to type their comms.

507

I don't play a lot of tactical shooters, so it's all on you, Moxie.

528
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:25,670
It's...

529
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,240
I believe in you.

530
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:29,990
Alright.

531
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,350
Alright, let's see.

532
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:36,290
Alright, we got to fix the...

533
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:38,790
They added a new VC.

534
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:39,230
Setup?

535
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:40,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

536
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:44,470
Yeah, I posted the...

537
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,990
Yeah, yeah, I posted the server code.

538
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:48,530
Nice, nice, nice.

539
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:51,290
Yeah, I made the custom lobby.

540
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:53,550
Very nice.

541
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:54,750
Did you try out all the characters?

542
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:55,990
I did.

543
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:57,570
I don't know who I'm going to play, to be honest.

544
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,750
Yeah, okay, so like, because you weren't at the rehearsal.

545
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,490
So, like, the shotgun does so much.

546
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:05,430
Like, it was literally one shot.

547
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,530
So I should pick up the shotgun.

548
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:10,050
Yeah, no, you should pick up the shot.

549
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:21,310
Because, like, when we were doing the rehearsal, because I had to 1V2, And literally like there was no counterplay because like when they're up, you know, because it's tactical shoot They're right up to your face and then they just go bop and you're dead.

550
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:37,430
I'm like, okay I had to play like a rat, all right, listen, okay, I was not aware I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, it's not like I skipped out on it.

551
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:39,350
They're like, he can't make it.

552
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:40,130
What do you mean?

553
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:41,930
They said he can't make it.

554
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,990
Why do you mean you weren't aware?

555
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:51,350
Like, it might have been, hey, I don't know, some things got mixed up.

556
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,950
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is, I don't know.

557
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:55,510
Yeah, yeah, it's okay, we can do this.

558
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:57,610
We don't need, you don't need tech rehearsal.

559
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:58,790
You don't need to know.

560
01:12:59,370 --> 01:12:59,430
Yeah.

561
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:00,570
And I played the tour.

562
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:01,530
I played everything.

563
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:03,170
I get the feel.

564
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:04,930
I watched the trailer too.

565
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,970
Like, I see how high-level play goes.

566
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:07,710
Yeah, exactly.

567
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:13,030
You saw those high-level plays, like, how they were, like, like working together as team.

568
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:14,570
Okay, so this is my plan.

569
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:18,390
There's like this guy with a giant wall that he holds like a giant shield.

570
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,230
I'm gonna put that shield out.

571
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,950
Yeah, I'm gonna put that shield and you just shoot everyone.

572
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:23,610
Okay, okay, okay.

573
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:26,310
I don't know if they know you can shoot the toes yet.

574
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,390
So we'll see.

575
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:30,290
Oh, yeah, they probably didn't play the tutorial.

576
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:31,010
Yeah, that's true.

577
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:31,350
That's true.

578
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:32,850
They probably don't know.

579
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:35,530
Like who would think about shooting the feet, you know?

580
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,570
You aim for the hit all the time.

581
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:40,230
So maybe, and the shield has a lot of HP.

582
01:13:41,590 --> 01:14:38,510
out that's great yeah the thing is how do i shoot from behind you one thing okay they won't see they only see me oh i'll be bait i'll go out and you go behind them and then you shoot them in the head and behind so i will peek out a little inch away from you yeah where they're already spamming all their bullets exactly and they have to reload you know okay so i was going when they reload okay yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's yeah see that's i don't know when they reload so like we're gonna figure that out we'll we'll get it figured out yeah it's team death match we have like we have like so many deaths before like it gets it gets into a problem like yeah yep oh i'll post i actually like this idea i'm telling you these guys actually probably have nothing planned exactly they're just look see in the discord they have their microphones muted they're not even talking to each other They're like solo.

583
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:40,690
They must be so awkward.

584
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:41,350
Yeah, yeah.

585
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:43,550
We have a plan and everything.

586
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:46,290
Like they're like, oh, I don't really know what to do.

587
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,650
Should I ask him?

588
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,690
No, make me think.

589
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:50,710
Yeah, I know.

590
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:54,310
Maybe we'll just shoot the gun, you know, just pick a character and shit.

591
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:55,750
But we're coming in with a strat.

592
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:56,770
We're going to farm them.

593
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:00,050
And we're going to get like zero deaths too.

594
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:01,770
Literally, literally.

595
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:04,510
Literally have a shield until they break the shield.

596
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:06,130
But that's not going to happen.

597
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:06,690
There's no way.

598
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:07,670
They're going to die.

599
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:37,950
before them yeah exactly they'll die before the shield is broken wait and i'll just throw a nade over you oh my god that's so true you can just throw a dade oh we'll just you just throw a dade he doesn't have a nade though he doesn't have an aid he has okay if he throws a nade we just we i just back away i walk backwards just and then my shield tanks the nade nice nice nice i was thinking i was gonna throw an aid but i don't i don't have one no we all have what do you mean we all have Okay,

600
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:39,350
well, my special ability.

601
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:40,310
Yeah.

602
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:43,190
Is, is a, is a, uh, like a trap.

603
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,950
Oh, you're going to use a traps and team deathmatch?

604
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,110
Where are we trapping?

605
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:48,810
I saw there was some good grenades.

606
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:50,210
I saw there was a lot of good grenades.

607
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:50,970
I'm not going to lie.

608
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:55,110
Okay, make sure you don't grab the character with a flash grenade or a smoke grenade.

609
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:57,370
So, because some characters only have flash or smoke.

610
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:58,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:58,590
Yeah, yeah.

612
01:15:58,610 --> 01:15:59,090
I've seen that.

613
01:15:59,450 --> 01:15:59,830
Yeah, yeah.

614
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,530
Okay, the flash was pretty OP though.

615
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,090
Like, you're literally blind.

616
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,250
Like, you only see, like, the tiny circle around you.

617
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:07,130
Oh, we're ready.

618
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:07,430
Okay.

619
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:09,910
So you do get blind once you get hit by a flash.

620
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:10,630
Yeah, it's not great.

621
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:11,570
Yeah, yeah.

622
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:12,110
Oh my gosh.

623
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:13,650
You get blind when you get hit by a flash.

624
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:14,370
Who would have thought?

625
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:15,290
Are you ready?

626
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:16,450
Yep, I'm ready.

627
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:16,850
All right.

628
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:20,150
We're going to have this whole plan and then we're going to get absolutely destroyed.

629
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,370
I feel like.

630
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:22,970
No, no, this is...

631
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:25,690
Like they have no plan.

632
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:26,390
Like we already know.

633
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:26,810
We already know.

634
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:27,350
All right, all right.

635
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,950
Okay, okay.

636
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:28,470
Okay, okay.

637
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,870
I got, okay.

638
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:29,710
I'm going in with...

639
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,550
But I don't know if you could change characters during death match.

640
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:34,750
So we got to commit to this.

641
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,370
Yeah, no, this has got to be the strat.

642
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:37,530
This is the word commitment.

643
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:40,690
Because if we lose, like, we have no other strat behind.

644
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:42,410
Yeah, this is our only strat.

645
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:43,130
Collision.

646
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,530
Okay, where are you?

647
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:45,510
Oh, there you go.

648
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:45,870
There you go.

649
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:46,590
Oh, you got this.

650
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:47,170
You got this.

651
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:47,730
There you go.

652
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:48,850
I hold this shield.

653
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:49,590
Oh, okay.

654
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:50,150
Okay.

655
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:50,510
Okay.

656
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:52,850
You can?

657
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:54,870
Okay.

658
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:56,030
Don't shoot my head.

659
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:57,870
I don't see them.

660
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:58,290
Okay.

661
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,270
I thought I heard them.

662
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:01,750
Oh, my God.

663
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:01,950
Okay.

664
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:02,770
I'm actually so scared.

665
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:03,630
I'm so scared too.

666
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:04,270
I'm so paranoid.

667
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:05,930
All right.

668
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:07,470
Don't worry.

669
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:08,130
I got your back.

670
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,070
I got your back.

671
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:11,070
Do I look backwards like this?

672
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:12,270
I got your back.

673
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,770
No, I die.

674
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:13,530
You're dead too.

675
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:13,990
Yeah.

676
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,810
I don't think I'm tired of the shield myself.

677
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:17,350
Okay, okay.

678
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:19,070
Yeah, yeah, I got your friend.

679
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,410
To our right.

680
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:19,710
To our right.

681
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:20,490
No.

682
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:23,690
Oh, there you go.

683
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,550
Throw a grenade.

684
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:26,810
Yeah, throw it at me.

685
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:28,510
There's a smoke.

686
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:34,090
I told you, Boxy, to make sure it's a grenade.

687
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,390
I don't have a grenade.

688
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:37,350
It's a smoke.

689
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:37,670
It's a smoke.

690
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:40,070
I told you

691
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,990
Okay, okay, they did it stuff again.

692
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:56,670
They did it stuff.

693
01:17:56,870 --> 01:18:00,890
We push up we push forward nice we push forward Oh, he's on the way.

694
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:01,630
I'm dead.

695
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:02,450
I'm dead.

696
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:03,530
He's stuck behind the check.

697
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:05,810
What happened was he?

698
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:08,490
He's good.

699
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:08,990
He's good.

700
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:09,530
He's good.

701
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:09,710
He's good.

702
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:09,930
Okay.

703
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:10,030
Okay.

704
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:10,630
He's good.

705
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:11,190
He's good.

706
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:11,770
Okay.

707
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:11,870
He's good.

708
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:11,870
He's good.

709
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:11,870
Okay.

710
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:11,870
Okay.

711
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:16,270
I'll be the shield maybe.

712
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:16,570
Okay.

713
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:17,310
You be a shield.

714
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:17,870
All right.

715
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:18,150
All right.

716
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,230
All right.

717
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:20,270
Okay.

718
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:20,910
I got this.

719
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:21,670
All right.

720
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,310
All right.

721
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,790
All right.

722
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:22,870
All right.

723
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:23,150
All right.

724
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:23,830
He said press B.

725
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:24,650
Yeah.

726
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:24,970
Yeah.

727
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:25,090
B.

728
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:27,310
Oh, no.

729
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:27,530
No.

730
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:27,710
No.

731
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:28,110
It doesn't work.

732
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:28,430
No.

733
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:28,890
Oh, no.

734
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:29,230
It doesn't.

735
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:29,770
Oh, no.

736
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:29,770
It doesn't work.

737
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:29,770
Oh, no.

738
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:29,770
It doesn't work.

739
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:29,990
Oh, no.

740
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:30,410

01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:37,170
Oh, wait.

745
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:37,670
The right.

746
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:38,210
There, there, there.

747
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:39,230
Okay.

748
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:39,970

They're actually there.

752
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:47,510
I'm so scared.

753
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:48,050
I'm so scared.

754
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:48,550
I'm so scared.

755
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:48,890

756
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:49,070

757
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:49,690

758
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:53,770
What's going on?

759
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:55,930
I thought you had a plan.

760
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,190
You could have swung here.

761
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,130
No, no, I had no plan.

762
01:18:58,290 --> 01:18:59,270

01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:42,550
It's okay, they won't know.

778
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:44,370
They're in the, they're in the grass, they're in the grass.

779
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,070
Where's the grass?

780
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:45,650
What's the grass?

781
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,190
Right there, right there, right there, in between us.

782
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,170
Oh no, in front of us.

783
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:49,550
Okay.

784
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:53,210
Oh my god, guys, shotgun, shotgun is close range.

785
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,810
Who would have thought?

786
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:55,230
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

787
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:55,790
I'm gonna go flank.

788
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:56,330
I'm gonna go flank.

789
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:57,950
Oh, he's just lit.

790
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,070
Oh no.

791
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:00,430
Okay, I saw I get okay.

792
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:01,390
Okay, I have it.

793
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:01,710
I have it.

794
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:02,070
I can swap.

795
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:02,450
I can swap.

796
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:02,970
Okay.

797
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:05,410
Because they're using shields.

798
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:06,370
They're cheating.

799
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:07,910
Okay.

800
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:10,810
I think our plan we should have kept with the shield plan.

801
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,030
I'm pretty sure we should.

802
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,590
Okay, I'm here.

803
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:14,250
I'm here with the shield.

804
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:14,830
All right.

805
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:15,690
We got this.

806
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,610
We just got key with the shield.

807
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:19,090
They're on the right.

808
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:19,850
All right.

809
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:20,930
I'm behind.

810
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:22,710
Oh.

811
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,350
Wait, can you shoot through that?

812
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:25,130
I don't think you can.

813
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:25,490
Yeah, maybe.

814
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:25,990
Yeah.

815
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:28,690
Probably on the outside.

816
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:29,470
Oh, right there in front.

817
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:29,870

822
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:31,890

01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:35,590
You go shield that, but you won't know.

826
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:36,050
Okay, okay.

827
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:40,830

867
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:26,690
Okay, to be fair, we didn't know.

868
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:27,510
No!

869
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:29,710
That's fine.

870
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:30,690
We were learning.

871
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:31,270
We were learning.

872
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:36,890
We were learning, you know, we were figuring it out and then it took us a while to get the shield going.

873
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:41,550
Okay, well I'm just saying the shield.

874
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:41,910
Okay.

875
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:43,030
She's right.

876
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:43,890
She can flank him.

877
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:44,190
Flank him.

878
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:44,510
Flank him.

879
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:44,750
Yes.

880
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:46,630
Look at that.

881
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:47,550
We should have done that.

882
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:48,850
We should have done that.

883
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:49,490
No, no, no.

884
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:49,850
Yeah, we should.

885
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:53,970
Honestly, I'm starting to think like, maybe I'm not that good with a shotgun.

886
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,470
This is the only time I've gotten the kill.

887
01:21:57,950 --> 01:22:24,850
only gotten kills with his gun so this is bad this is bad okay but we figured it out though we've downloaded the system we we figured it out oh no okay okay it's just one guy we just got killed that guy and then it's fine because look at he got all the kills look at this dad see this it's literally him okay and pen must be a gamer then yeah no he's a pro player so like Oh,

888
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:25,370
okay.

889
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,850
We just need to kill him and then we win.

890
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:29,470
Okay, okay.

891
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:30,370
That's okay.

892
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:31,970
We're fine then.

893
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:32,350
We're fine.

894
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:32,990
We're fine.

895
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:34,810
It's just it's just him.

896
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:36,190
Think of a way to kill him.

897
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:37,890
I think we do the shield thing.

898
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:38,810
We do the shield thing.

899
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:42,990
But like you it's like that bait thing, you know, like we bait them and then.

900
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:46,070
Oh, by the way, friendly fire is on.

901
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:47,530
Oh, okay.

902
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,090
Do we?

903
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,370
Because I was thinking I might have shot you.

904
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:50,590
I was like, whoa, you're doing damage.

905
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:51,130
All right.

906
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:53,650
Do we do we do team death match again?

907
01:22:53,650 --> 01:23:24,130
or do we do search and destroy because like i didn't think it would go that fast all right yeah i'm gonna do i'm gonna do death match again all right let's do that again i feel like we can oh yeah 10 minutes okay all right yeah that's another he doesn't need to be ready that's okay all right this is fine this is fine our strat okay so you shield you bs bait i flank or either one of us baits the other guy we figured it out I have him.

908
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:26,910
But honestly, I kind of like this guy's gun.

909
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,290
Oh, yeah, like the...

910
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:30,030
What gun do you have?

911
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:31,150
This shield guy's gun.

912
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:33,030
You just see, like, an MP9?

913
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:33,970
Oh, shit.

914
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,010
I think mine's an AK.

915
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:36,790
I mean, it looks like an AK.

916
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:38,730
Okay.

917
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:39,630

01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:43,250
You go in and distract them.

922
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:44,770
I feel like I know where they're going to go.

923
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:45,770
They always go in the center.

924
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:46,770
Yeah, no.

925
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,250

926
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:50,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

927
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:52,770

01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:55,490
They're deep.

931
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:58,910

01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:03,430
We're figuring it out.

981
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:04,490
We figured it out.

982
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:08,370

01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:14,050
Same spot.

01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,810

01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:24,690
We flanked.

1001
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:25,970
Yeah, where's that spawn?

1002
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:26,450
I don't know.

1003
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:27,270
It's back there.

1004
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,170
You see that red...

1005
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:28,750
Red area?

1006
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:29,690
Yeah, it's right there.

1007
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:30,970
Now we're in there, spawn.

1008
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:33,750
Now we're spawned in there.

1009
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:34,710
I'm gonna...

1010
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:35,830
Okay, okay I'm gonna use a hammer.

1011
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:37,290
Okay.

1012
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:38,710
Oh, wait.

1013
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:41,830
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1014
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:44,130
I'm trying to hammer the beast!

1015
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:44,870
You got this!

1016
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:46,270
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, oh, no!

1017
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:47,030
Wait, wait, wait.

1018
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,950
Oh, no, you will put me in a bad spot!

1019
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:51,690
Okay.

1020
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:55,510
as well as I thought it would.

1021
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:58,130
Yeah, I feel like a hammer doesn't really beat a gun most times.

1022
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:03,670
Yeah, for some reason, the hammer is not as strong as I thought it would be.

1023
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:05,550
Who would have thought?

1024
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:06,250
I got two.

1025
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:09,970
How did they get five?

1026
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:14,150
I don't even remember dying five times.

1027
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:17,170
Yeah, because I died three times.

1028
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:18,070
Oh, yeah.

1029
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:19,650
I'm going left.

1030
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,010
Let me know if you see that.

1031
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:21,730
Oh, they're right in front of me.

1032
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:22,110
They're in front of me.

1033
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:22,650
Okay, I'm flanking.

1034
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:22,950
I'm flanking.

1035
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:23,510
They don't know.

1036
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:25,970
Oh, oh man, I'm hit.

1037
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:26,310
I'm hit.

1038
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:26,510
Okay.

1039
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:28,510
Oh my god, what?

1040
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:29,510
He headshot me.

1041
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:30,550
Holy shit.

1042
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:30,910
Okay.

1043
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,530
I was not expecting that headshot.

1044
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,310
Okay, I gotta use my terrain better.

1045
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:36,070
I gotta crouch underneath terrain.

1046
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:37,250
Yeah, yeah, we gotta.

1047
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:39,330
He like shot me in the head, I think.

1048
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:39,850
I'm gonna crouch.

1049
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:41,330
He can't shoot me in the head if I'm crouched.

1050
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:43,950
Can't headshot me.

1051
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:44,510
Yep.

1052
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:46,710
I actually think they won't keep that in mind.

1053
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:47,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1054
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:48,750
There's no way they'll know.

1055
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,030
I'm gonna do the longest flank of my life, so live.

1056
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:52,730
Oh, he's one in front of me.

1057
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:53,110
He's hiding.

1058
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:54,770
I don't see him.

1059
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:56,370
I got him.

1060
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:57,110
I got him.

1061
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:57,730
There we go.

1062
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,350
See, this is the strike.

1063
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:58,970
Oh, we get the help back.

1064
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,870
There's a help back in front of you.

1065
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:02,170
I'm glad you're like an ammo box.

1066
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:02,630
Oh, wait.

1067
01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:03,250
That is.

1068
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:03,850
No, no, it is a help back.

1069
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:05,970
Oh, no, no.

1070
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:06,430
To your left, to left.

1071
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:07,030
Back left.

1072
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:07,630
Yeah, hide out.

1073
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:08,530
Couch, crouch, crouch.

1074
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:08,890
I'm crouching.

1075
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:14,610
Oh, my God.

1076
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:15,370
He almost got me.

1077
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:16,490
Nice.

1078
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:17,950
Oh, he's pushing me.

1079
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:18,650
Wait, wait.

1080
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:19,310
No, no, no, she's not.

1081
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:19,590
She's not.

1082
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:20,710
Oh, no, no.

1083
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:21,750
You shoot this, no.

1084
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:23,330
Okay, I'm pushing.

1085
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:24,070
You're cooked.

1086
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:27,790
Oh, you're cooked!

1087
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:28,490
You're cooked!

1088
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:29,390
Oh, shit!

1089
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:30,030
I'm one!

1090
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:32,690
Oh, I'm coming back with a grenade!

1091
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:33,210
No, I couldn't!

1092
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,290
That's 1 HP!

1093
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:35,630
You got me!

1094
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:36,330
Oh, they can catch up.

1095
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:39,070
I realize we have... We do have names.

1096
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:40,810
I'm gonna use my name.

1097
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:41,230
Oh, I hit him.

1098
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:42,410
Grenade.

1099
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:43,670
That's my name!

1100
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:44,110
That's my name!

1101
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:44,610
That's my name!

1102
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:45,190
That's my name!

1103
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:48,410
Okay, I'm doing a... Nice?

1104
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,050
I hit him a little bit.

1105
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:51,430
Okay, I'm reloading.

1106
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:53,990
Oh, you can... You can wallbang, by the way.

1107
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:58,570
All right, they're- Oh, they're all looking at me!

1108
01:27:58,650 --> 01:27:59,390
They're looking at me!

1109
01:27:59,390 --> 01:27:59,950
Oh, no.

1110
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,110
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1111
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:02,350
To the right.

1112
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:05,790
They're like...

1113
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:06,610
Over here.

1114
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:07,030
My right?

1115
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:08,350
The right ping.

1116
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:09,790
I think they ran off.

1117
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:10,590
I think they ran off.

1118
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:14,350
We got this.

1119
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:15,990
Moxie, careful.

1120
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:16,550
They could...

1121
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:17,590
You'll get caught to the left, too.

1122
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:19,450
Okay, okay.

1123
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:20,490
We...

1124
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:22,250
I mean, Loki, we got 15 seconds.

1125
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:22,970
Loki, by the night.

1126
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:23,350
Just run.

1127
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:24,630
Oh, no, no, no!

1128
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:26,310
I'm stuck!

1129
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:27,990
Oh no, it's fine.

1130
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:29,250
Oh no, we gotta get killed.

1131
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,910
We gotta get killed.

1132
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:30,790
We gotta kill him.

1133
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:31,690
We gotta kill him better.

1134
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:34,470
Oh no, oh no.

1135
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:35,310
Wait, this is deathmatch.

1136
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,930
It's a draw.

1137
01:28:38,810 --> 01:29:09,010
no we had it we had it why did we rush why did we do that i don't know we're just look we're just blood thirsty okay we don't we have to be patient we're just alpha yeah we're just yeah yeah yeah we're just alphaing it okay yeah that's that's it that's it we're not pussies we're not pussies yeah we're not stupid yeah we're just alpha what do you mean i threw moxie died first And then I threw after him.

1138
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:10,890
It's a team game, you know?

1139
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:11,990
It's a team effort.

1140
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:13,090
Yeah, it's a team effort.

1141
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:16,690
We wanted to be, we wanted to throw together.

1142
01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:20,910
We actually want them to think we're, you know, we're bad.

1143
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:25,250
Because like, yeah, and then the third game is where we turn it around.

1144
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:26,950
This is where we turn it around.

1145
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:28,230
Yeah, right here.

1146
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:29,230
We got this.

1147
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:30,530
We have the strat now.

1148
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:34,370
Oh, they were like jump over.

1149
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:36,010
Okay, I accidentally started.

1150
01:29:36,930 --> 01:30:07,690
this fast it's okay we can make this fast i'm ditching the shield i'm gonna give the shotgun one more try and give the shotgun one more try i believe okay but they're so far they've been doing range though to me yeah yeah they even wait maybe if i do desert eagle and oh wait i have a plan i have a plan i'm using what's your plan what's your plan i have a desert eagle i just headshot okay oh okay that's okay that's good that's a good plan And then I have this.

1151
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:07,850
Watch.

1152
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:08,490
This is a camera.

1153
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:09,730
Look, see?

1154
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:10,990
It gives us intel.

1155
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:13,570
Oh, they left the match.

1156
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:14,450
Okay, never mind.

1157
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:16,430
They left the match.

1158
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,350
Yeah, we gotta do a team game.

1159
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,170
We gotta leave.

1160
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:21,710
I guess we have to leave.

1161
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:22,250
It's okay.

1162
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:23,910
I'd run away too.

1163
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:25,050
Yeah, exactly.

1164
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:25,970
They're running away.

1165
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,630
They're so scared of us.

1166
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:30,470
They knew we were evolving.

1167
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:32,910
Yeah, they knew each game.

1168
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:35,990
We, they knew.

1169
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:36,650
They knew.

1170
01:30:36,930 --> 01:31:04,330
they were like they were so scared because we figured out the strat so they're like we don't want to play against them anymore we won by default it's technically one one exactly yep yeah yeah because we didn't quit we ain't no quitters yeah yeah no they they they forfeited yeah they forfeited exactly we take that all right i put the new server yeah yeah it's in the general

1171
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:41,240
here okay okay i'm joining oh i'm starving what did you eat today what i actually haven't had anything because it started like 9 30 9 30 a.m for me okay okay yeah because i'm in west coast all right okay this is search and destroy so you know like how with the plant or like breach was so we're attacking right now so okay um i don't know what to play I don't Yeah,

1172
01:31:41,280 --> 01:32:01,060
I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm gonna have to bring you a hammer guy out I mean, I could start hammering Yeah, I might I might pull him out I don't know Oh, you're gonna do the hammer guy Well, I'm gonna look at the map first And then decide Okay I don't know Okay,

1173
01:32:01,140 --> 01:33:09,660
so There's two points for this map Alright Only the defense Let's see Oh like 12 seconds to figure out what we want to play i feel like because this is close quarters i feel like i should be playing shotgun you want to do a hammer gun now uh if i can find them no no no it's next to me it's next to me okay oh no okay i have a shotgun though so it should be fine i'm down to start at the park where are we oh there is the park okay well that's so far though shouldn't we be at the staircase it's closer to the point what i was thinking i was like i was like okay the staircase is like one entryway oh also i wanted to see the park because i wanted to see the the the the scenic route oh that's true i just want to see how outside look and then like they have to wait for us so they'll be like so paranoid while we're like slowly walking over yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they'll be way too paranoid well i love how they did this outside all right Where's the map?

1174
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:10,940
Oh, there it is.

1175
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,640
We got a breach anyway.

1176
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:16,620
Alright.

1177
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:17,560
Oh, breached.

01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:18,680
It breached.

1179
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,120
Oh, wow.

1180
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:20,900
Oh, my God.

1181
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:22,380
Wait, this is actually like...

1182
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:26,000
This is actually... I feel like they'd be like on the point and stuff.

1183
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,620
They definitely have set up traps and everything.

1184
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,400
I'll be right behind you.

1185
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:30,860
Devices.

1186
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:32,800
Oh, it's a motion.

1187
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:33,700
You got motion detected.

1188
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,340
They know!

1189
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:35,860
I'm spotted.

1190
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:37,200
They spotted you.

1191
01:33:38,060 --> 01:34:39,640
I'm going to the other way i hear one on my left oh oh oh they're gonna flank you by gentlemen by gentlemen yep two of them i hear him nice yeah let's go oh my god why did they push up on their defense yeah they gotta they gotta hold the point yeah i guess because you think okay yeah rookie mistake look at that rookie mistakes rookie okay so it's carnivores all the way far right is this guy what now i'm thinking like i'm thinking i just i just 2v1 like i look oh 2v1 that's true you might as well just stay you know what yeah i'll be hammered this guy yeah yeah but at the same time do we really need to hammer anything i just fisted that door two times and it was done that's so true i feel like hammer is just like a state what if i hammer them from behind you think oh wait hold on you get a hammer kill they're actually ruined yeah yeah yeah it'll be ruined then it'll be like so easy okay so like you actually think starting at the park did help That's true.

1192
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,880
No one came, like what's good.

1193
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,360
Yeah, yeah, it made them so paranoid.

1194
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,320
And they pushed out us.

1195
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:46,900
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1196
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:51,880
They didn't stay in their point, they're like, oh, maybe they're still trying to figure out where to go.

1197
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,320
They're so lost, which we were, but we used that to our advantage.

1198
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,580
Yeah, exactly.

1199
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:57,140
It was planned.

1200
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,320
Yeah, it was so planned.

1201
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,140
Like, you could break down if you want.

1202
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:03,460
Or we're going here or which way?

1203
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:04,600
Oh, yeah, we'll go this way.

1204
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,880
All right, I'm just being silly.

1205
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:07,840
I have a shotgun.

1206
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:08,280
All right.

1207
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:12,540
Maybe we purposely find our detectors.

1208
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,060
Wait, are you motioned?

1209
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:16,760
No, no, no, no, no.

1210
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:17,660
I accidentally pinged.

1211
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,480
I was looking at the map.

1212
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:20,100
Okay.

1213
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,260
I'll go to the right.

1214
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,820
If I get shotgun, that is my bad.

1215
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,440
Okay, I'm at the same spot I was at before.

1216
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:33,840
And I'm at that other spot I was at before.

1217
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,880
Okay, I'm literally so far away from you.

1218
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:36,900
This is...

1219
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:37,520
Oh, this is bad.

1220
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,020
I'm making my way back.

1221
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:38,760
That is bad.

1222
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:40,160
We gotta stick together.

1223
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:41,220
Motion.

1224
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:42,240
Okay.

1225
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:42,960
I shot it.

1226
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:43,480
I shot the motion.

1227
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:44,140
Oh, you should have.

1228
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:46,140
Oh, you should have used that motion to your advantage.

1229
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,280
Oh, should I?

1230
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:47,700
Yeah, yeah.

1231
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,040
Like bait them out, you know?

1232
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,560
Oh, what's that?

1233
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:51,340
They made a foam wall.

1234
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,160
They made a foam wall.

1235
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:52,740
Oh, my God.

1236
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,200
They're playing on site.

1237
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:54,920
Oh, my God.

1238
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:55,580
They're so smart.

1239
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,320
When we go to A.

1240
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,460
I think we should go A.

1241
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,040
We should go A.

1242
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,080
Yeah, we should go A then.

1243
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:01,840
Yeah, I see.

1244
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:02,200
I see her.

1245
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:02,480
I see her.

1246
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:03,540
Wait.

1247
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:05,260
I'm gonna go.

1248
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:06,660
We have one minute.

1249
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,020
I'm gonna go.

1250
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,160
I'm gonna do the long ass thing.

1251
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,860
Did you need yourself?

1252
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:13,800
Yeah, kind of.

1253
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:16,940
I feel like we could go A.

1254
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1255
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:20,500
Okay, okay.

1256
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:21,440
Should I come with you?

1257
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:23,260
Wait, wait, actually, we can breach that wall.

1258
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:23,900
You see that wall?

1259
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:24,560
Let's breach it.

1260
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:24,980
Yep, yep.

1261
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:25,880
I got the hammer.

1262
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:26,680
You ready?

1263
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:27,960
Okay, okay.

1264
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,080
You cover me.

1265
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:29,600
I'm breaching.

1266
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,060
Oh, I messed up.

1267
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:33,120
Breach, for real!

1268
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,120
Don't chase, chase, chase!

1269
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:35,420
Oh, he's close, he's close, I got him!

1270
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:36,320
Oh, my God!

1271
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,740
Next, he's one, he's one.

1272
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:38,240
Help, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1273
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:39,260
Look, look, look.

1274
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:41,140
We did.

1275
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,500
Oh, my God.

1276
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:43,440
I don't.

1277
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:47,040
No, no, no, the hammer's broken.

1278
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:49,860
They're like, yeah, no, no.

1279
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:50,900
They're not going to run the hammer.

1280
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,120
They're not going to run the hammer.

1281
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,640
Okay, I might have missed, but it still worked.

1282
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,300
The plan still worked.

1283
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,880
They're like, what was that thump?

1284
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:02,160
Yeah, what was that?

1285
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,140
Who came?

1286
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:04,060
Who did that?

1287
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:07,680
Yeah, there's no way they're running the hammer.

1288
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,160
No way.

1289
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,540
Who would hammer the wall?

1290
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:12,380
Who's that stupid?

1291
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:14,660
Little did they know.

1292
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,040
They're that stupid.

1293
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,040
Oh, we're defending.

1294
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:18,060
Oh, I blinked.

1295
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,220
We're defending.

1296
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:20,800
Okay, well.

1297
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,220
Okay, so I have a hammer for defense.

1298
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:26,140
Setting wire.

1299
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,140
I'm putting fences.

1300
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,940
I'm gonna put fences on this wall.

1301
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:32,280
Setting wire.

1302
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,940
Wait, did you guys defend the point A?

1303
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:37,280
Wait, I'm point A?

1304
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:37,860
Your point B?

1305
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:38,380
Yeah.

1306
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:39,940
I started at point B.

1307
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:40,800
What do you mean?

1308
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:45,260
I thought it was like a, I thought it was like a, like let him, you know, flip a...

1309
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:45,720
Oh, that's true.

1310
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:46,420
We could flip it.

1311
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,080
That's true.

1312
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:47,880
Should we do that?

1313
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,680
I'm just putting barbed wire anywhere.

1314
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:50,340
Hold on.

1315
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:50,660
Wait, wait.

1316
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,140
I'll play.

1317
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:51,820
Oh, wait.

1318
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,420
I got a plan.

1319
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:54,100
Setting wire.

1320
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,180
I'll play here.

1321
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,240
If I die, I die.

1322
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:03,220
Okay, I got two of my barbed wires up.

1323
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:08,290
Oh my God.

1324
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:08,950
Wait, I hear it.

1325
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:09,530
Oh my God.

1326
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:09,770
Wait.

1327
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:10,630

Like, they don't know.

1332
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:08,500
It's actually PvE.

1333
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:09,380
There's PvE.

1334
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:11,780
Zombies come out?

1335
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:13,200
Yeah, the zombies are coming out.

1336
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,440
We're PvEing right now.

1337
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:15,760
So they'll get curious.

1338
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,640
Where is that point?

1339
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:19,100
Oh, wait.

1340
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:19,600
Did you hear that?

1341
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:20,440
Oh, oh, yeah.

1342
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,240
No, I hear some...

1343
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:24,840
There is a character that shoots motion, like...

1344
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,100
Motion sensors, yeah.

1345
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:26,820
Through the walls.

1346
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:30,400
Okay, it's to our left.

1347
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:31,520
The site?

1348
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,460
Is it?

1349
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:35,040
No, it's very dead.

1350
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,460
What is it not?

1351
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:37,320
It's A and B.

1352
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,160
Oh, I'm looking at the wrong...

1353
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,240
Sorry, my camera angle is looking at the wrong...

1354
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,440
My camera angle is not the right way.

1355
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,040
Oh, they have the foam wall.

1356
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:48,620
You see that?

1357
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:49,780
I see that.

1358
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,340
We have wires here.

1359
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:53,640
They have wires.

1360
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1361
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,460
I think it's time to breach soon.

1362
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:00,120
I...

1363
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:00,900
You have foam walls.

1364
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,380
Oh, I feel like this is a free breach.

1365
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:04,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1366
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:05,480
I feel like they foam themselves off.

1367
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:20,800
by the way cover me cover me yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep oh we're in there we're so in there i'm going to oh my god i got i got one but i'm so i'm so messed up i think i have brain damage

1368
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:38,540
I didn't know how to play it.

1369
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,080
30 seconds remaining.

1370
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:41,500
Oh my god.

1371
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:44,040
Bro, he's just using the wall!

1372
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:45,780
Oh wait.

1373
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,680
I can crouch.

1374
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:49,380
No!

1375
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,240
He was so sneaky!

1376
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,920
He's so sneaky!

1377
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,500
Oh my.

1378
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,660
He's so sneaky.

1379
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:00,860
Okay.

1380
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:02,700
Wow.

1381
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:03,840
Okay.

1382
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:05,560
You know what?

1383
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,720
They played that whole pretty good.

1384
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:07,540
They played that.

1385
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,620
They defended that pretty good this time.

1386
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:11,900
They're evolving.

1387
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:14,480
I feel like there's normally not a hole there, but they made one.

1388
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:17,400
Yeah, they made the hole to make sure that we would...

1389
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,380
Oh my gosh, I should have faked it and go to the other side.

1390
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:22,100
But then I was scared of the wires.

1391
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:28,180
Alright, they won't expect us to be super close to them, right?

1392
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:29,300
Surely.

1393
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,100
Because, like, we've always been playing so far.

1394
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,900
Do you want to go through emergency room?

1395
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,080
Oh, yeah, we should.

1396
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:36,460
We should.

1397
01:43:39,080 --> 01:44:33,940
I feel like I feel like they're setting up thinking we're going this way yeah yeah we how are you paying that x x oh yeah we should go here and then we go from oh we breach here we breach here oh my god wait look at use the waypoints with that oh my god there's some good damn arrows okay all right where the heck is oh I already I'm already confused where we are yeah like where are wait oh it's still it's here it's here it's here this is the emergency i'm moving do we break this i mean there's an edge at regular it wait what do you see that oh my god wait yeah that was our reflection oh is that reflection oh i was like oh i hate you i'm sorry i'm sorry oh no oh my god oh my god you're actually so low oh my god it's over that is it's over before i'm gonna hit you two times in the back of that oh my god i was like i was like this is not breaking concussion Okay,

1398
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,640
remember there was a wall we could breach?

1399
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:40,340
Yeah, there's a wall here, but I'm just crouching under it.

1400
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:41,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1401
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:48,230
I wonder if they can see us.

1402
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:51,850
Oh, sneaky.

1403
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:54,150
I can breach that wall.

1404
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:55,150
You think it's worth it?

1405
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:56,030
Can they hear us if we're doing this?

1406
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:57,250
I think they don't can't hear the crouch.

1407
01:44:57,330 --> 01:44:57,650
Are you ready?

1408
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:58,830
I'm gonna breach it.

1409
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:00,750
Oh, I will get shot.

1410
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:02,590
I will get shot the moment I do this.

1411
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:03,730
So you better be ready.

1412
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:04,570
Ready?

1413
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:05,530
Okay, three.

1414
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:06,550
Ready to breach the wall.

1415
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:08,710
Nowhere.

1416
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:10,570
Oh.

1417
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:13,090
I don't see them.

1418
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:14,470
Okay, I'm actually Loki really scared.

1419
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:16,210
I'm so paranoid right now.

1420
01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:19,770
I'm so paranoid, Moxie.

1421
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:20,930
Where are they?

1422
01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:22,790
I don't know.

1423
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:23,530
I don't know.

1424
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:24,670
Do I shoot this barbed wire?

1425
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:27,110
Do you shoot it?

1426
01:45:27,370 --> 01:45:27,850
Nope.

1427
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:29,310
Oh my god, they're right here.

1428
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:30,050
They're right here.

Yeah, they're like Oh, should we go back to the shield?

1516
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:13,970
Like what the shield worked in team death match, but this is not team death match.

1517
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:18,330
Yeah, this is not no team death match This is where you gotta use your brains.

1518
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:19,790
Lock in.

1519
01:49:20,030 --> 01:49:21,330
We're so locked in.

1520
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:24,170

01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:32,710
We barricade that door.

1525
01:49:32,830 --> 01:49:33,690

Traps set.

01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:51,320
Oh god, be careful.

1534
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:52,860
They're coming in soon.

1535
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,300
Okay, I'm not running out of barricades.

1536
01:49:57,740 --> 01:49:58,160
Trapped ready.

1537
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:02,320
I swear to God, they shot you while you're trying to put barricades on, I swear to God.

1538
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,280
It's not stopping.

1539
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:05,900
It's not stopping.

1540
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:08,880
It's not stopping, he just keeps barricading.

1541
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:10,780
Wait, if you're gonna barricade, I would barricade this.

1542
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:11,540
What the fuck?

1543
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:14,380
They'll never- And make a hole?

1544
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:15,820
Make a hole in the wall we have?

1545
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:17,260
Make a hole.

1546
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:20,840
Wait, I should make a hole here.

1547
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:21,140
Wait, wait.

1548
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,340
Make a hole here.

1549
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:25,860
They're not coming from my side.

1550
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:27,940
There you go.

1551
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:33,550
Wait, I'll come...

1552
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:35,770
I'll make a tiny hole here.

1553
01:50:36,050 --> 01:50:37,590
I'll make a tiny hole here.

1554
01:50:40,130 --> 01:50:41,870
So, like, we have, like, two ways.

1555
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,140
Oh, they're...

1556
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:47,080
They're...

1557
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,280
They're, like, why are they...

1558
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:49,300
It's all barricaded.

1559
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:50,360
They're so confused.

1560
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,640
Should I drill camera something?

1561
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:54,540
Which is the word?

1562
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,560
I feel like we should hear a sound before we drill camera.

1563
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:58,240
I don't hear anything.

1564
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,000
Yeah, what are they sneaking though?

1565
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:01,140
Oh, that's true.

1566
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:02,860
It's up to you.

1567
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:03,920
Use your brain.

1568
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,880
You're like 999 IQ.

1569
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,120
I believe in you, Moxie.

1570
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:10,280
I don't know.

1571
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:11,590
I'm going to waste it.

1572
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,540
They ain't breached.

1573
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:16,220
Oh, wait, wait.

1574
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:17,520
Oh, they breached it!

1575
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:18,080
Oh!

1576
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,580
What the thing?

1577
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:25,280
Oh my god.

1578
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:26,000
Oh my god.

1579
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:27,200
30 seconds remaining.

1580
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:29,720
You saw him.

1581
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:30,120
You saw him, right?

1582
01:51:30,260 --> 01:51:30,980
Yeah, I saw him.

1583
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,860
Wait, so I don't have long range.

1584
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:34,320
Oh wait, I do.

1585
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:34,920
I have a pistol.

1586
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:35,860
Oh, I'm hit.

1587
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:40,590
Oh my god, I'm hit too.

1588
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:41,470
No!

1589
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:42,270
Oh no.

1590
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,590
This is bad.

1591
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:47,050
10 seconds remaining.

1592
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:50,450
Wait, 6 seconds.

1593
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:52,230
Oh my god.

1594
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:52,690
Oh my god.

1595
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:55,790
Oh

1596
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:17,970
That was so genius, but I actually I feel like it didn't I feel like they should have ran out of time But I think if you planted it doesn't stop unless that's messed up.

1597
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:21,190
Oh my god I was like oh, so genius.

1598
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:24,390
I know that's so much my plan.

1599
01:52:24,990 --> 01:52:27,370
It was my plan Oh, it's 2-2.

1600
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:31,090
It was 0 for one entire second.

1601
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:35,370
So I was waiting for it to count down.

1602
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:38,210
I lost track of my character.

1603
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:39,270

Okay, he's behind.

Oh my god.

1658
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:28,660
This is the longest plan of my life Moxie, I believe in you, Moxie.

1659
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:29,880
You can game.

1660
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:34,090
Oh, to the right?

1661
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:35,590
He's got to go through the door.

1662
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:37,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1663
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:38,030
Yeah!

1664
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:39,610
You like that?

1665
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:40,250
You like that?

1666
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,710
Yeah, let's go!

1667
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:42,790
Bob up and down?

1668
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:44,130
Oh, my gosh!

1669
01:55:44,150 --> 01:55:44,930
Like a fish.

1670
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:45,850
Like a fish.

1671
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:48,470
You're weaving and bobbing.

1672
01:55:49,170 --> 01:55:49,650
Literally.

1673
01:55:49,890 --> 01:55:50,990
You used your crouch.

1674
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:51,590
Look at that.

1675
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:52,470
Look at that.

1676
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:53,430
Not even close.

1677
01:55:53,810 --> 01:55:55,930
It was 3-2, but not even close.

1678
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:57,210
Not even close.

1679
01:55:57,730 --> 01:55:59,430
We'd let them have those two.

1680
01:55:59,650 --> 01:56:00,530
Oh my god, five.

1681
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:02,010
I think it's because I shot the wall.

1682
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:04,650
It's just shooting the wall.

1683
01:56:05,630 --> 01:56:06,030
Oh my.

1684
01:56:06,070 --> 01:56:08,570
You lose your accuracy when you just shoot walls.

1685
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,810
I didn't know that.

1686
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:12,930
Okay, that.

1687
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:14,130
That was great bait.

1688
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:15,890
Like, they're double looking at you.

1689
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:16,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1690
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:17,610
I was thought.

1691
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:19,330
Oh yeah, they were so confused.

1692
01:56:19,590 --> 01:56:20,430
They didn't know what to do.

1693
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:22,550
They just saw me and they're like, what do we do?

1694
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:24,790
The doggies in Maine.

1695
01:56:24,950 --> 01:56:26,330
We need all the pressure on her now.

1696
01:56:27,730 --> 01:57:41,090

Oh, no.

1757
02:04:17,740 --> 02:04:18,500
Oh, my God.

1758
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:19,520
Oh, my God.

1759
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:20,160
I'm 1 HP.

1760
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:22,300
Oh, my God.

1761
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:22,680
Nice.

1762
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:23,680
Oh, my God.

1763
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:24,320
Oh, my God.

1764
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:25,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1765
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:26,300
The Twitch squad, no, three.

1766
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:27,300
I'm telling you, this guy's good.

1767
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:28,640
I'm going the other side, I'm thinking.

1768
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,640
I'm literally one, so I have to flank.

1769
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:32,040
I'm going as well.

1770
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:32,240
Frag out.

1771
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:35,720
Wait, I can breach this.

1772
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:36,160
Are you ready?

1773
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:38,920
Okay, I guess you just shoot through it.

1774
02:04:38,980 --> 02:04:39,300
We're ready.

1775
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:39,840
I'm going to breach.

1776
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:40,220
I'm going to breach.

1777
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:41,320
I'm going to sacrifice my life, right?

1778
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:42,360
Three, two, one.

1779
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:43,960
Three, three, one, dated.

1780
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:46,980
Go in.

1781
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:48,680
Get the producer.

1782
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:49,900
Get the producer.

1783
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:52,560
Okay, you...

1784
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:52,880
Producer down.

1785
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:54,320
Producer down.

1786
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:57,560
We did it.

1787
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:00,320
No, number three, like, this guy was out.

1788
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:01,360
Yeah, like...

1789
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:02,740
Number three was game.

1790
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:03,620
one.

1791
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:06,420
Okay, he insta-locked kayak.

1792
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:06,980
Like, he knows.

1793
02:05:07,060 --> 02:05:07,700
He knows it's good.

1794
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:08,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1795
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:09,020
He's been watching.

1796
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:09,700
He's been watching.

1797
02:05:12,140 --> 02:05:12,980
There you go.

1798
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:15,020
Oh, apparently.

1799
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:16,500
Oh, wait.

1800
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:17,700
Does someone not get in?

1801
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:19,900
Wait, did we kill three or four people?

1802
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:20,320
I know.

1803
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:21,020
We killed four.

1804
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:21,660
We killed four?

1805
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:22,380
Oh, so it worked.

1806
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:22,820
Okay.

1807
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:24,440
It worked.

1808
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:26,420
You go Dragon number three.

1809
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:26,720
Alright.

1810
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:27,620
Same plan.

1811
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:33,030
There we go.

1812
02:05:33,130 --> 02:05:36,110
Wait, someone in my chat said TwitchCon 03 is Shroud.

1813
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:37,310
TwitchCon?

1814
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:38,730
Oh, no.

1815
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:40,150
No, there's no way.

1816
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:40,970
No, I can see it.

1817
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:41,790
I can see it.

1818
02:05:42,730 --> 02:05:43,950
Well, she's got to make sense.

1819
02:05:44,070 --> 02:05:46,030
Is this crowd streaming right now?

1820
02:05:46,190 --> 02:05:47,110
Like, playing.

1821
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:48,390
It could be a run.

1822
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:49,770
Oh, that's true.

1823
02:05:49,850 --> 02:05:50,630
He could have a rerun.

1824
02:05:50,830 --> 02:05:53,910
He had the, he recorded the stream in advance.

1825
02:05:54,030 --> 02:05:55,410
So he could come here and play with us.

1826
02:05:55,810 --> 02:05:56,130
Yep.

1827
02:05:56,910 --> 02:05:58,790
I mean, that's what the, that's what the birds were saying.

1828
02:06:00,490 --> 02:06:01,450
Wait, why is there three?

1829
02:06:01,530 --> 02:06:03,110
Wait, where is our fourth guy?

1830
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:03,970
Where did he?

1831
02:06:04,450 --> 02:06:05,430
Where are you?

1832
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:06,090
Where are you?

1833
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:07,290
I'm on the other side of the map.

1834
02:06:07,370 --> 02:06:08,850
Oh, you're on the other side.

1835
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:09,970
I mean, they won't know.

1836
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:10,570
They won't know.

1837
02:06:10,810 --> 02:06:12,550
The long-ass flank of your life.

1838
02:06:13,090 --> 02:06:13,470
Oh, my God.

1839
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:15,210
Wait, this is actually a genius flank.

1840
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:15,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1841
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:16,510
They won't know.

1842
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:18,030
Well, let me know when you guys are making noise.

1843
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:20,290
We're making noise right now.

1844
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:21,870
Our shield guy.

1845
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:23,590
He's, like, doing his thing.

1846
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:24,470
Okay.

1847
02:06:24,730 --> 02:06:24,970
Okay.

1848
02:06:28,970 --> 02:06:29,470
All right.

1849
02:06:30,210 --> 02:06:32,110
Wait, why am I front-lining this?

1850
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:33,190
This is not my job.

1851
02:06:33,530 --> 02:06:34,130
Oh, my God.

1852
02:06:34,230 --> 02:06:35,050
Our shield guy got hit.

1853
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:38,230
That ain't good.

1854
02:06:39,950 --> 02:06:40,850
We're making noise.

1855
02:06:41,150 --> 02:06:42,290
By the way, you have the bomb.

1856
02:06:42,370 --> 02:06:43,150
Yeah, I'm already on A.

1857
02:06:45,150 --> 02:06:46,130
I'm on the site.

1858
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:46,510
I'm dead.

1859
02:06:46,850 --> 02:06:47,830

02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:52,310
Oh, no, Boxy, what happened?

1866
02:06:52,990 --> 02:06:53,230
What happened?

1867
02:06:53,230 --> 02:06:56,710
Okay, I was thinking you guys, like, had all four of them there.

1868
02:06:56,830 --> 02:06:57,770
They were two behind me.

1869

Okay, yeah, it was not four.

1870
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:01,790
It was absolutely not four.

1871
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:03,210
Sticky bomb deployed.

02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:52,160
That was my bad.

1975
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:56,800
I'm just drawing random arrows.

1976
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:58,680
It's the same pathway.

1977
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:02,380
It's like, it's like a little Google Maps.

1978
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:03,660
I only can place up to eight waypoints.

1979
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:05,760
Alright.

1980
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,160
That's our little Google Maps.

1981
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:10,360
Okay, to be fair, we started off punching each other.

1982
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:13,760
like it did not start out well.

1983
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:14,900
I walk in front.

1984
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:15,740
Oh, they're going to punch each other.

1985
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,440
Oh, no, they're working.

1986
02:18:17,660 --> 02:18:17,680
Yeah.

1987
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:19,460
They're actually way better than me.

1988
02:18:19,620 --> 02:18:19,840
What the hell?

1989
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:21,920
They're so much more.

1990
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:23,200
Oh my God.

1991
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:25,420
Oh, we lost both of them.

1992
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:25,860
We are.

1993
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:26,760
I'm running.

1994
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:27,860
I'm running.

1995
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,960
We have two minutes to work with.

1996
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:32,500
Wait, but the bomb is on the other side.

1997
02:18:32,600 --> 02:18:33,400
They dropped the bomb.

1998
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:33,620
Yeah.

1999
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:34,880
They're all on the bomb.

2000
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:35,440
They're all on the bomb.

2001
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:36,380
We got to just get weird.

2002
02:18:36,480 --> 02:18:37,080
We got to get weird.

2003
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:37,780
Oh, you're right.

2004
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:38,540
Wait, wait, I can't.

2005
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:40,380

There was nothing I could do.

2009
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:14,900
I could have killed, no, I could, that was my bad.

2010
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:15,940
That was half HP.

2011
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:19,160
You know, we got three, we almost got three by ourselves.

2012
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:22,100
Like, our team, they sold, they sold.

2013
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:22,880
They sold.

2014
02:19:23,060 --> 02:19:23,680
It wasn't us.

2015
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:24,540
They sold.

2016
02:19:29,530 --> 02:19:29,950

I feel like, Hayes has been working, you know, yeah, exactly.

2020
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:39,430
You know, they got the producer now.

2021
02:19:39,570 --> 02:19:41,170
The producer's locking in.

2022
02:19:42,030 --> 02:19:43,530
The producer's backseating everyone.

How do I get out?

2028
02:20:53,170 --> 02:20:53,630
How do you get out?

2029
02:20:53,730 --> 02:20:54,610
How do we get out?

2030
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:56,130
Oh, they're breaking the doors.

2031
02:20:56,570 --> 02:20:57,150
They want to go A.

2032
02:20:57,610 --> 02:20:57,750
Maybe.

2033
02:20:57,970 --> 02:20:58,250
Oh, no.

2034
02:21:00,010 --> 02:21:00,770
Or they're breaking something.

2035
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:03,110
Hey, um, TwitchCon 4, you break the door.

2036
02:21:06,770 --> 02:21:07,850
We gotta get it.

2037
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:08,670
How do we get out?

2038
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:09,330
We lock this.

2039
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:11,870
That's how we get out.

2040
02:21:12,270 --> 02:21:13,370
Oh my god, there's nothing I can do.

2041
02:21:13,830 --> 02:21:14,550
I have a shotgun.

2042
02:21:16,890 --> 02:21:17,290
Oh my god.

2043
02:21:17,530 --> 02:21:17,910
This is bad.

2044
02:21:18,530 --> 02:21:18,950
This is bad.

2045
02:21:19,750 --> 02:21:20,170
Oh, the door name!

2046
02:21:20,350 --> 02:21:20,790
Oh my god!

2047
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:23,750
They threw so many nades!

2048
02:21:24,230 --> 02:21:25,050
They threw...

2049
02:21:25,690 --> 02:21:26,570
Oh, no.

2050
02:21:26,590 --> 02:21:27,050
There was...

2051
02:21:27,570 --> 02:21:31,990
We locked her, so I didn't think the other Twitch chat person was going to be in there with me.

2052
02:21:32,410 --> 02:21:34,690
I thought I was just locked myself in.

2053
02:21:34,930 --> 02:21:35,850
Oh, no.

2054
02:21:37,250 --> 02:21:40,970
Look, I will say, they did throw 20 nades at me.

2055
02:21:41,050 --> 02:21:41,630
I don't think...

2056
02:21:41,630 --> 02:21:42,130
I've seen that.

2057
02:21:42,210 --> 02:21:42,530
I've seen that.

2058
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:44,070
I don't think I would have lived.

2059
02:21:45,350 --> 02:21:48,290
Alright, apparently we do Team Deathmatch back in.

2060
02:21:48,770 --> 02:21:50,250
Oh, the...

2061
02:21:50,870 --> 02:21:53,090
But I feel like they just got so lucky there, no?

2062
02:21:53,330 --> 02:21:55,190
Yeah, they got just so lucky those three rounds.

2063
02:21:55,530 --> 02:21:56,070
Yeah, exactly.

2064
02:21:56,250 --> 02:21:56,850
It was just luck.

2065
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:58,710
They just, like, it was timing, you know?

2066
02:21:58,850 --> 02:22:00,810
You were still setting stuff up.

2067
02:22:01,050 --> 02:22:01,310
Yep.

2068
02:22:01,490 --> 02:22:03,850
And, you know, they caught me in my pants down, bro.

2069
02:22:03,870 --> 02:22:04,650
Yeah, exactly.

2070
02:22:05,050 --> 02:22:05,750
They caught me.

2071
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:09,330
They were going to do a bathroom break, and they, how, that was so rude of them.

2072
02:22:09,610 --> 02:22:11,430
Just shooting you while you're in mid-pee.

2073
02:22:12,970 --> 02:22:13,370
Literally.

2074
02:22:14,610 --> 02:22:17,170
Like, what happened to etiquette, you know?

2075
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:18,230
Yeah, wait.

2076
02:22:18,390 --> 02:22:19,270
I love the sportsmanship.

2077
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:21,730
What happened to that?

2078
02:22:24,270 --> 02:22:26,030
It wasn't very smart me to lock myself.

2079
02:22:26,050 --> 02:22:27,250
I got new people on for 03 and 01.

2080
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:27,970
Yeah.

2081
02:22:28,770 --> 02:22:29,650
It's time to swap.

2082
02:22:31,150 --> 02:22:32,850
Were we playing with the same team or are we swapping?

2083
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:34,230
I don't know.

2084
02:22:35,670 --> 02:22:41,610
I'm waiting until I'll ask, are we playing same team or swapping teammate?

2085
02:22:44,430 --> 02:22:46,090
Wait, it sounds like you type really fast.

2086
02:22:47,650 --> 02:22:50,310
I had to like delete my message.

No more manual camera.

I, you saw me bobbing and weaving the hammer kills, okay?

2236
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:33,660
I was like, I'm not dying by the hammer.

2237
02:31:34,060 --> 02:31:36,880
I rather die by the gun than the hammer.

2238
02:31:37,380 --> 02:31:43,580
Like, you saw me running away to a bullet.

2239
02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:46,260
At least I didn't get hammered.

2240
02:31:46,580 --> 02:31:52,340
I feel like I should, I think like, um, the auto camera was better during deathmatch.

2241
02:31:52,360 --> 02:32:34,860
than it is for um for manual manual was good i think manual was good for uh for uh search and destroy um because like i was able to keep the camera where i wanted it to keep but like team deathmatch i had to use the auto one was actually it fell a lot better i should have kept that auto in the beginning for team deathmatch um but it was great time shout out to pubg again for the sponsor uh hope you guys check out pubg blind spot um had a great time playing with moxie um um he was uh mpin was gaming like he's a pro player um so he was doing so much like we were i was like oh my god
