1
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,520
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,080
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,400
I am back on the YouTubes.

4
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,540
Today, oh my gosh, I have a lot of update stuff to go through.

5
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,280
I also, I wrote like a... I usually, for those who don't know...

6
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,720
Sorry, I'm waiting for the coffee to kick in.

7
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,740
I got myself some coffee.

8
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,660
I had to choose between gamer subs or coffee today.

9
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,100
And then I was like, you know what?

10
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,580
I haven't had coffee in a long ass time.

11
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,140
Let's see if gamer subs has fucked me up yet.

12
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,180
And we're like, what do you mean by that, Doki?

13
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:28,860
Well, I'm really worried that, you know, I feel like almost every time I stream Marvel Rivals, I like grab gamer subs in me to like stay focused and awake.

14
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,280
I'm worried I built a tolerance because of that.

15
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,100
And gamer subs has a lot of, has a lot of like caffeine in it.

16
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,940
So I'm like, well, let's see if, if I'm fucked up forever.

17
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,660
Let's see if coffee still works on me.

18
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,480
So that's what I'm trying out right now.

19
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,860
I'm gonna try and see if the coffee still works.

20
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,860
It is pretty bad because like, um, I usually don't drink caffeine.

21
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,400
But I think like, I don't know.

22
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,120
I almost feel like Marvel Rivals might be bad for me, but I can't tell you.

23
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,920
I needed, I need more, I need more tests to figure it out.

24
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,500
So that means I got, you know, you can't go through a conclusive result.

25
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,980
You can't give a conclusive analysis if you don't go, if you don't have enough results to back it up.

26
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,020
So like, I need more, I need a bigger sample pool, guys.

27
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,380
I need a bigger sample pool to make sure that my hypothesis is correct, guys.

28
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,160
And that's the scientific method.

29
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,740
If any, if middle school taught me anything, it's how to do the scientific method.

30
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,800
Exactly, I need a larger sample size.

31
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,780
So unfortunately, or fortunately, I gotta play a little bit more just to figure it out if it's true or not.

32
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,300
To see if it is bad for me.

33
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,740
Anyway, anyway, I'm not addicted.

34
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,000
I can quit whenever I want.

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,640
I say as I start drinking caffeine again.

36
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,860
Anyway, I, for those who don't know, I usually write like, um, things I want to talk about.

37
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,100
And then like this random server that I have that's just for like streams and stuff.

38
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,160
So let me look through.

39
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,060
There's like a lot of stuff I want to talk about.

40
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,280
Okay, so yesterday I had a nightmare.

41
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,000
But like, you're like, oh my god, Doki, are you okay?

42
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,400
But like, it's not type of, I told this nightmare to one of my friends.

43
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,200
And they're like, they laughed at me.

44
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,140
And I was like, no, you don't understand.

45
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,660
You don't under, in the moment, I was so sad.

46
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,800
You guys are like, gonna be like, oh no, I never tell you guys the story.

47
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,100
The nightmare, you guys gonna be like, Doki dot dot dot.

48
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Okay, so this was the nightmare I had.

49
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,220
Like, I woke up, I was so fucking like, depressed when I woke up.

50
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,480
So, um, basically in my dream, I was in a, I was in a restaurant.

51
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,880
And I don't know, I think I was like in, I think like the time period was that I was like a university student and stuff.

52
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,560
So like, I was in a restaurant.

53
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,140
And they're like, and then like, you know, like the students are and I were like, oh, one of the students was like, we should get crepes.

54
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,040
And I was like, oh my god, I fucking want crepes so badly.

55
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,460
Yeah, we should get crepes.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,600
And then, and then so like, the thing is, but the crepes is that when the crepes are starting to come out, we have to make it ourselves.

57
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,120
So we have to like, squirt the batter stuff ourselves and stuff like that.

58
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
But I didn't know how to do it.

59
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,080
I was like, oh my god, I don't know how to do this.

60
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,200
But there's a lot of people in this restaurant.

61
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,560
I was like, when it finally was my turn to get the crepes, they're like, you gotta do it yourself.

62
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,560
I was like, but I don't know how to do this.

63
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,100
So the staff came up and was like, don't worry, we'll do it for you.

64
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,180
And I was like, oh, that's great.

65
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,080
So I sat at the table and waited for the staff to make me my crepe.

66
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,960
And I waited.

67
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,300
And I waited.

68
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,400
And then the students, the other students were like, well, it's time to go now.

69
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,360
So I guess I'll see you guys.

70
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,880
See you later.

71
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,780
And I was like, okay.

72
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,020
And I kept waiting.

73
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,500
And I was like, where's my crepe?

74
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,200
And then so I went to the staff's like, hey, I'm still waiting for my crepe.

75
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,720
And they're like, oh my god, I'm so sorry.

76
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,480
We're gonna make your crepe.

77
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,640
So I was like, all right, cool.

78
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,440
And then I waited and I waited.

79
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,700
And then the staff came out and with my crepe.

80
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,000
And then they gave it to a person on a different table.

81
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,700
I was like, wait, that has to be my crepe.

82
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,620
There's no way.

83
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,500
I was like, no, no, that can't be it.

84
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,400
So now I waited.

85
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,540
And I waited.

86
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,100
And I saw the staff packing up and leaving the restaurant.

87
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,720
I was like, wait, who's gonna make my crepe for the restaurant?

88
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,060
I saw the staff just left.

89
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,500
I yelled and I was like, crepe.

90
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,420
And then they yelled back, we already made the crepe.

91
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,860
I was like, I was the one that ordered it.

92
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,020
And the most boring nightmare ever.

93
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,280
I was like, no way, I was the crepe.

94
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,860
Like, oh, sorry.

95
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,240
And then I guess we'll, don't worry, we'll send someone back.

96
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,260
I was like, okay.

97
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,900
So then I waited.

98
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,540
And then someone came, one of the staff members came back to the restaurant.

99
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,480
And like, all right, we're gonna make your crepe.

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,380
I was like, oh my god, thank you.

101
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,590
I waited for so long.

102
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,660
And then I woke up.

103
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,220
I was so sad, I was so sad.

104
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,300
I never got my crepe, guys.

105
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,840
I never got it.

106
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,820
I was doing so, it wasn't even, yes, you don't understand.

107
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,580
I never got my crepe.

108
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,340
You don't understand.

109
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,060
It was a nightmare.

110
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,620
I waited for so long.

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,760
I never got it.

112
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,080
This is nuts.

113
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,980
It was, it was a nightmare.

114
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,540
I was tempted by the, I saw so many other people with their crepes.

115
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,520
But I didn't even get my crepe.

116
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,280
It was a fucking nightmare.

117
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,660
I'm so sad.

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,600
I woke up so sad.

119
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,580
I was like, I never got it.

120
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,480
Everyone else around me got it.

121
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,280
And I never got mine.

122
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,340
This is more like a Seinfeld episode than a nightmare.

123
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,140
Mr. Stan, thank you for the super chat.

124
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,820
Thank you, thank you.

125
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
Julia Faye, worse than death.

126
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,220
Solid Snake, thank you for the super chat.

127
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,080
Thank you, thank you.

128
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,900
Medi, thank you for the super chat.

129
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,000
Thank you, thank you.

130
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,680
Everyone, tell your crepe that you love them tonight.

131
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,160
Thank you for the super chat.

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,560
Thank you, thank you.

133
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,420
So that was my nightmare yesterday.

134
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,420
And then I was just so sad because I was like, I could have got it.

135
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,320
I could have got my crepe, but I never did.

136
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,020
There were so many instances where I could have got it.

137
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,060
I don't even know why I dreamt about it.

138
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,960
I guess I just ruined a crepe.

139
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,660
I never even ordered one, too.

140
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,040
I woke up from my nap and I never, I was just like, man.

141
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,400
I never got my crepe.

142
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,100
Anyway, time to grab some coffee.

143
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,400
Anyway, time to make some spaghetti.

144
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,800
I never even end up getting crepe in the end.

145
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,620
Anyway, that was my nightmare yesterday.

146
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,460
All right, Doki Amber Doge update.

147
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,980
So I found out that...

148
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,300
Okay, so like, I walked...

149
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,320
Okay, there's two updates.

150
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,380
There's two updates.

151
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,620
So last night, I walked him at midnight.

152
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,280
And like, it's really silly.

153
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,940
While I was walking him...

154
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,800
So obviously, there's like, no cars around.

155
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,140
Yeah?

156
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,940
So like, there's no cars around.

157
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:00,340
And so I was walking him and there was this one car that stopped at a red light.

158
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,360
And I was crossing the street.

159
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,700
And there's this guy.

160
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,940
He like, rolled down his window and then just shouted at me.

161
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,600
Hey, you have a cute dog!

162
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,100
And I was like...

163
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,260
Thank you!

164
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm just like...

165
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,640
Okay.

166
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,140
I'm like, I'm pretty sure that guy's fucking high or some shit.

167
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,340
Because I'm Canada.

168
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,120
I'm like...

169
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,780
I'm just like...

170
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,280
Thank you!

171
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,860
I was just like...

172
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,680
And like, he shouted so loud.

173
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,740
I was like, it's midnight.

174
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,460
It's midnight and there's nobody here.

175
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,720
I felt so awkward because I'm like, I could hear you.

176
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,900
You don't have to shout.

177
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,860
It was so loud.

178
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,340
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was like, he was not sober at all.

179
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,260
Because there was somebody like, in the passenger seat too.

180
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,880
So, cat calling?

181
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,480
No, dog calling.

182
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,640
Because like, I don't know what the fuck the driver was thinking.

183
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,000
Because it was like, some guy in the passenger seat that rolled down their window to shout that out at me.

184
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,480
So, that happened.

185
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,160
Another Doki Amber Doge update.

186
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,480
I found...

187
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,220
Okay, so...

188
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,560
I found something else that he fucking hates.

189
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,780
And no pretty woman can stop his hate for it.

190
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,640
So like, this is this morning.

191
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,420
I was waiting at the crosswalk.

192
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,280
And then, a pretty woman was next to me.

193
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,620
So then, Doki Amber Doge's dad was like, oh my god, she's so pretty.

194
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,120
And then, the thing is, she had rollerblades on.

195
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,840
But he didn't realize what they were.

196
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,440
So, he was like, oh my god, you're so pretty.

197
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,400
Can you like, touch me?

198
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,260
So, he like, walked up to her.

199
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,760
And then, so like, she ignored him.

200
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,000
Because like, I don't know, maybe she just doesn't like dogs.

201
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:17,060
And then, because usually, like, you know, when dad approaches women, they would like, try to pet him and stuff.

202
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:25,140
And then, dad would be like, yes, just as I foresee, I knew you would touch me.

203
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,420
But like, this time, this woman ignored him.

204
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,620
Because she was like, on her phone and stuff.

205
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:40,660
And then, so, but then, obviously, the crossing road turned, like, you know, you can cross the road.

206
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,600
It turned like, white.

207
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,640
Because it's like, a person.

208
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,180
And so, and then, she started rollerblading out.

209
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,380
And then, dad freaked the fuck out.

210
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,260
He was like, what is...

211
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,580
Like, he started barking at her.

212
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,540
Like, he wanted to chase her and started barking at her.

213
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,020
And was like, what is this, you fucking freak?

214
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,940
He's like, what is this?

215
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,180
Rollerblades?

216
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,440
What is on your feet, demon shoes?

217
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,520
He was like, oh my god.

218
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,380
He's like, what the fuck goes on your feet, you fucking freak?

219
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,840
Like, she just started rollerblading.

220
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,780
And he fucking freaked out.

221
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,020
And he was like, he was like, what are your...

222
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,740
What...

223
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,580
Demon shoes!

224
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,800
This is unnatural!

225
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,520
So, he was freaking the fuck out.

226
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,220
He wanted to, like, chase her down.

227
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,520
Had to, like, drag him.

228
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,040
I was just, like, pulling back on the leash.

229
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,820
I was like, no!

230
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,380
No, dad!

231
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,020
And she just rolled away.

232
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,760
And dad was so freaking out.

233
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,540
Because he's just like, oh my god.

234
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,320
I don't know what she is, but she is not real.

235
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,660
She is not real.

236
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,240
Curse you and your wheels.

237
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,060
She's a witch!

238
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,900
A murder!

239
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,460
But yeah, that's another...

240
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,120
That's another...

241
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,580
You got two dad updates today.

242
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,120
Um...

243
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
So, finally.

244
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,720
I still have a lot of things to talk about.

245
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,260
But I'm gonna fucking...

246
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,800
What's the word?

247
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,460
Space them out.

248
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,740
So, like, I have more content for other streams.

249
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,320
But I'll give you guys a Marvel Rivals, Twitch Rivals team update.

250
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,900
So, we finally got our sixth player.

251
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,000
It's very difficult because I actually, like, let the team pick the sixth player.

252
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,680
Because I was like, I don't know.

253
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,880
I actually really want to get top four.

254
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,860
So, I was like, you guys pick.

255
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,120
Here's, like, all the people that, like, sent...

256
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,740
Some of them even...

257
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,820
Some people even, like, DM'd me to, like, be like...

258
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,280
Oh, can I be on your team?

259
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,960
Like, here are my...

260
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,340
Here's, like, my trackers and everything.

261
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,060
Like, here's, like, uh, like, uh, what, like, my rank is, what I play.

262
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,560
So, the biggest issue was that a lot of people that wanted to join my team, um, was like...

263
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,060
Oh, uh, they shared the same hero pool as me.

264
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,660
So, like, they literally played the same things as me.

265
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,680
And there was no point in picking somebody up that played the same thing as me.

266
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,220
Because, like, because then, like, why I would be playing that role?

267
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,260
Like, because I'm the highest rank for support.

268
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,920
So, obviously, I'd be playing that role.

269
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,500
Um, so, like, why would you put the weaker player on the role that I'm the best at?

270
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,820
So, um, so, it was, like, Luna Snow.

271
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
And I'm actually really...

272
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,800
I finally unlocked my third eye and figured out how to play Cloak and Dagger.

273
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,540
Like, it was crazy.

274
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,680
I, like, I have, like, an 80% win rate on Cloak and Dagger now.

275
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,180
I actually unlocked my third eye.

276
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,880
I fucking finally figured it out.

277
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,460
Like, at first, I didn't understand, but now I understand.

278
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,560
But, like, so, but a lot of them played characters that I played.

279
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,060
So, like, you know, Luna Snow and Mantis is, like, the two characters I specialize in.

280
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:16,920
I can play any support, but I specialize in, like, Luna, Mantis, and Adam.

281
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,080
So, obviously, um, Cloak and Dagger is pretty easy.

282
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,720
Yes, but then you have to time her Cloak ability.

283
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,120
That was the thing I had the most trouble with.

284
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,620
It was, like, the DPS, the blinding.

285
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:39,620
I was really bad at blinding and, like, timing the, like, um, the Cloak ability.

286
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,360
For, like, enemy ults.

287
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,940
So, when Magneto ults, I have to be able to Cloak everybody at the right time.

288
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,880
So, like, that's what I struggled the most.

289
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,300
But I finally fucking opened my third eye this season.

290
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,240
Like, I, I did, I had a game.

291
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,660
I had, like, several games on Cloaks where I actually denied Strange ult and, like, and Magneto ult.

292
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,520
So, I was, like, so happy because I was, like, I finally did it.

293
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,880
I figured it out.

294
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,360
I unlocked it.

295
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,060
Like, I, I finally no more 30% win rate on Cloak and Dagger.

296
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,580
I had a 30% win rate on Cloak and Dagger last season.

297
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,340
But, like, this season, I finally did it.

298
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,040
I have an 80% win rate on Cloak and Dagger.

299
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,320
I fucking finally figuring it out.

300
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,160
I understand now.

301
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,640
Um, anyway, so.

302
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:44,880
So, so, like, obviously, there's a lot of people, there's a lot of support players in Plat or, like, Gold in Plat that were basically my same hero pool.

303
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,280
So, like, that, like, narrows it down a lot of, like, candidates.

304
00:17:48,560 --> 00:18:00,220
And then, um, and apparently, uh, the, one of the members, one of the pro players was, like, messaging some of the people and just, like, giving them, like, it was sort of like a mini trial or something.

305
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:12,500
Like, giving, like, analyzing their, like, matches and, like, two of the players actually, like, got together in a call and was, like, also, I would never pick up a Rocky Raccoon player.

306
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,840
I don't, I fucking, I would never get over my prejudice against Rocket, Rocket.

307
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,420
I will never pick up a Rocky Raccoon player.

308
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,280
Anyway, so, especially their one chick on Rocket Raccoon.

309
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,820
So, like, two players got in a call.

310
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:45,740
Two of the pros got in a call and were, like, looking through account stats and, like, looking through, like, replays and, um, and, and, like, um, and, like, seeing, like, who would best fit, uh, who would best fit our team.

311
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,820
Cause I was like, I don't fucking know who to pick up.

312
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,720
I don't know.

313
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,240
So, um, also, in the end, we picked up a small timer.

314
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,200
Um, she was one of the few people that wanted to join.

315
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:07,640
She sent in, like, wanted to, uh, apply to, not, like, say apply, but, like, wanted to join, um, during my open call for teammates.

316
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,200
And, um, so her name is Sabubu.

317
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:20,480
And if you guys don't know who Sabubu is, she is actually an incredibly, apparently from what I'm told, she is an incredibly talented, uh, female player.

318
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:34,760
Um, she is, uh, she used, she was a top 100 deadlock player and was also a Valorant professional gamer for female teams.

319
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,040
And she's also, uh, really young.

320
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,940
I was like, man, I feel like shit.

321
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,060
I saw, I was like, wait, she's, she's how old?

322
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,740
And she was a top 100 deadlock player.

323
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:01,340
Don't, you can literally look up her username and see, like, she has a Liquipedia page, by the way.

324
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,100
She has a, she has a, she has a Liquipedia page.

325
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,540
And I was like, I don't have a fucking Liquipedia page.

326
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:19,860
I don't even have a Liquipedia page, guys.

327
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:30,720
Anyway, um, um, so yes, but she has never played Marvel Rivals before.

328
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,340
So, like, that's what I was really concerned about.

329
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:46,660
Um, but then she played one game on, she, then she, she has, like, and then she, like, was like, don't worry, I can learn really, really, really fast because she was top 100.

330
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,580
She was top 100 deadlock player.

331
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,040
And then deadlock is a third person, is a third person shooter.

332
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,460
So it's, like, pretty similar.

333
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,980
I can, I can, I can, the aim is sort of similar.

334
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,740
And she already has, she has hands, like, she, she has hands.

335
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,060
So she can, she can aim.

336
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,620
So that's good.

337
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,500
Um, and so she's been, like, hard grinding, uh, Marvel Rivals.

338
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:29,400
Uh, why do I, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, um, so she's hard grinding Marvel Rivals right now to, like, like, learn everything, learn, like, her role in time for Friday.

339
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,040
So that's the update.

340
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,720
We had a lot of people that really wanted to join.

341
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,560
It was so difficult.

342
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,660
I mean, I didn't have to make the choice because I was like, I didn't want to take responsibility.

343
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,800
So I was like, I recruited four of the other members.

344
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,640
It's your turn.

345
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,960
You recruit the last one because I don't fucking know.

346
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,440
I'm done.

347
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,140
So, so I was like, you guys handle the sixth member.

348
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,340
I don't fucking, I don't care anymore.

349
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:02,400
I did my job and then I had to, like, organize, um, but you're the captain.

350
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,760
That's why I made the open call, guys.

351
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,180
I made the open call for, I got the, I got the applicants in.

352
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,600
It was up to them to figure out.

353
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,900
Yeah, and I delegated, guys.

354
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,820
I thought you guys wanted me to delegate more.

355
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,880
I delegated it to my other teammates to figure out our last member.

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:40,480
So, and it was good because, like, so BooBoo was, uh, it was, um, was not up a plat because she didn't play, she didn't play Marvel Rivals season zero.

357
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,600
So that was great.

358
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,400
Um, you know what was funny?

359
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,580
I, I wrote in the recruitment post.

360
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,480
I was like, please, it has to be maximum plat.

361
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,120
And then I got people applying.

362
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,620
They're like, I'm GM.

363
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,660
I was like, I'm sorry, man.

364
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,360
But the application was already denied when you said I'm GM.

365
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,960
Well, we specifically told her, we're like, do not grind past plat.

366
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,700
That's what we told Kony, too.

367
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,000
Because Kony was like, oh yeah, I stopped that plat, um, just so I could get the rewards and ever sort of played more after that.

368
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,940
And I was like, do not get past plat.

369
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,600
Like, we need you at plat.

370
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,280
I was like, we need you in plat.

371
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,060
That you are, this is our only hope.

372
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:42,300
So we told both of our plat players that they have to, well, technically, so BooBoo is not in plat yet.

373
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,000
I think she's like almost at gold.

374
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,640
But like, she might get to plat.

375
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,280
And we're like, do not get past plat.

376
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,040
We, we need you to stay.

377
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,760
We need you to stay there.

378
00:23:51,880 --> 00:24:01,980
So we actually, our team already got, like, ruled booked twice by other teams because our team is like one of the stronger teams.

379
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,540
I mean, like, yeah.

380
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,300
I mean, I think a lot of teams are going to complain about my team, for sure.

381
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,160
Because, like, my team is not made for, like, it's made to have fun.

382
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,720
But we want to win.

383
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,980
We want to get top four.

384
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,520
Like, we want to get top four.

385
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,620
So it's a lot of money, in general.

386
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,180
Like, for, it's a lot of money.

387
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:39,820
Like, apparently, it's like, it's like, if you win every match on day one, plus first place, each player gets around 5k each.

388
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,540
5k each.

389
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,100
So that's already a lot.

390
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:56,780
Because in the official Marvel Rivals tournament, um, in the official Marvel Rivals tournament, I think first place was, like, less than 1k for each player.

391
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,620
And it was longer, too.

392
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,280
It was, it was, like, in the span of, like, one, like, a month and a half.

393
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,040
And they had to, like, scrim and then, you know, go to games.

394
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:17,500
And it was literally, like, less than 1k for first and second place for each player.

395
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:24,020
I think, like, second place team got, like, I think, like, $500 for, like, second place.

396
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:37,860
And so, so, like, within Twitch Rivals, for two days, you can, we, at max, at max, you can get, like, um, around 5k maximum for first place and winning every match.

397
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,640
So I was like, guys, we got it.

398
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,420
Also, like, you know, my ego, too, so...

399
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,320
Also, because of my, you know, boosting my ego as well would be pretty nice, too.

400
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,360
Like, that's, like, the bonus for me.

401
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,120
For me, it's just ego.

402
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,240
For the other players, it might be for money.

403
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,140
Um,

404
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,260
so, so, um, so, yeah.

405
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:18,580
So we actually got rulebooked twice by different teams because my team, like, on paper, seems very not fair.

406
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,640
But I try, I, like, double check the rules to make sure, like, everything is fine.

407
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,400
Or the rulebook count.

408
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,560
So, like, one of the rules is that, um, we can only have two Overwatch pros.

409
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,140
For some reason, they don't count Marvel rival pros.

410
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:45,880
They're like, you can only have two maximum Overwatch pros, um, that's been a pro player for a year.

411
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,320
So, like, at most a year.

412
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,500
So if they've been a pro player within the last year, then it counts.

413
00:26:52,500 --> 00:27:04,260
But thing is, I only have one player, technically, um, on my team that was a pro Overwatch player within the last year.

414
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:13,180
So, like, the other, the two other players, because I have three players that are in the, um, like, in, like, one of the best Marvel rival teams.

415
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:20,960
And, and, uh, uh, obviously, that doesn't count for some fucking reason.

416
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,840
So I was like, that's my loophole.

417
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:32,660
Like, I was like, I was like, that's my loophole because it's not in the rules that they can't be current Marvel rival pro players.

418
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,220
They just have, they just can't be Overwatch pros.

419
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:52,720
So, so, anyway, anyway, so I have, so, um, my tank player, Hogs, was apparently a coach for Overwatch, but, like, he wasn't a pro player.

420
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,800
He was a coach.

421
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:04,680
So one of the members, one of the teams tried to rule book us and was like, Hogs should be counted as a pro player because he was a coach in Overwatch 2 within the last year.

422
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,740
And I was like, okay, we got the maximum two players.

423
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,820
Like, it still doesn't matter.

424
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,400
I was like, doesn't matter.

425
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,660
I can have two because our third player was never pro.

426
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,620
He wasn't, like, Gomez never went professional.

427
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:28,800
So, in Overwatch, he was just, he was in team Columbia.

428
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,360
He was in team Columbia, but that was like two or three years ago.

429
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:41,200
So, so, so, like, that was past a year ago.

430
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:49,360
So, so, whoa, we still fit the requirement.

431
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,660
So, um, it doesn't count.

432
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:10,180
And, like, a World Cup team doesn't technically, doesn't count as a pro because he was just in, like, the World Cup team.

433
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:19,380
So, there was just, like, a, but, like, I found loopholes by getting baby and old people.

434
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,780
Yeah, definitely not rigged at all.

435
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,280
I just really wanted, I just want to do well, guys.

436
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,660
I really love Marvel Rivals, guys.

437
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,840
I basically, I am the loophole analyst.

438
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,440
I was like, that's why you gotta cover all your bases.

439
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,820
Cover all, I'm very surprised.

440
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,260
I mean, it's not my fault you got, like, 500 loopholes.

441
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:02,600
So, that's why I'm aiming for, um, I'm aiming for top four.

442
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
I hope we get top four.

443
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,960
I'll be really sad.

444
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,760
I mean, I'd be sad, but I also hope we have lots of fun.

445
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,620
Um, so, I'm very excited.

446
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,820
I'm really, really excited to, to play on Saturday and Sunday.

447
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,040
I should be, I should be a lawyer.

448
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,820
You need to hire Doki to write the rulebook.

449
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,720
Mori, thank you for the super chat.

450
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,040
Thank you, thank you.

451
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,900
Um, anyway, so, yeah, that's basically the Marvel Rivals team update.

452
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,820
So, like, we're planning on scrimming, actually scrimming against other teams.

453
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,440
I've actually hit up other captains for other teams.

454
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,760
So, I'm, we're planning on setting up, like, because we don't practice our chemistry and synergy with, um, the plat players.

455
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,420
So, like, with Coney and Sabubu.

456
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,440
So, like, I want to make sure that we are okay.

457
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,580
Coney's getting coached by our tank player now, right now.

458
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,180
Well, not now, like, later today.

459
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:05,180
So, um, our, our main tank, our other, our, our, like, top 500 pro tank player is coaching Coney tonight.

460
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,960
So, that won't be on stream, apparently.

461
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,520
I think they're doing, like, off-stream coaching.

462
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,640
Um, and, um, so, we're gonna make sure Coney can work with our other tank player.

463
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,780
And we're gonna be scrimming against other teams.

464
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,860
So, I actually hit up a couple captains to be like, hey, you want to, like, scrim against us?

465
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,740
Because, like, you know, I just want to make sure that our team knows how to play with each other and everything.

466
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,720
So, um, so, we're planning on scrimming against other teams before the tournament and stuff.

467
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,120
I feel like it's, I don't know.

468
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,060
I don't know if I'm taking it way too seriously or if it's actually gonna be this serious.

469
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:44,600
Like, like, you know what's funny?

470
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,560
Apparently, J3 already announced his team, but Brawl Pro is on J3's team.

471
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:57,480
Um, and I actually was thinking about getting Brawl Pro as the sixth player, but then I remember he was an Overwatch player.

472
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,920
I didn't realize he never got passed to Ma- I didn't realize he didn't get to Masters in Overwatch in the last year.

473
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,900
I thought he did, because he used to be GM in Overwatch.

474
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:13,380
So, like, I legitimately thought he was GM and I thought he at least got to Masters within the last year.

475
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:20,340
So, um, so I was like, um, but then he was like, why didn't you ask me?

476
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,560
I'm already on J3's team.

477
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,400
Because when I made the open call, he messaged me and was like, why didn't you ask me?

478
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,680
Um, I, like, now I'm on J3's team, but if you asked me, I would have joined your team.

479
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,700
And I was just like, oh, I didn't know.

480
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,360
I thought you were.

481
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,840
You told me you play Overwatch.

482
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,040
I see you play Overwatch.

483
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,320
I thought you were Masters.

484
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,200
I never see him stream Overwatch, like, within the last year.

485
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,260
And he used to be.

486
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,320
Anyway, so I told Kony, because I found out.

487
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,040
Bropo is one of their tanks on J3's team.

488
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,140
And I messaged Kony about that.

489
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,800
He hasn't replied back because he's, like, really busy.

490
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,120
Because he has both the Sage Arm Slam and the, um, and this tournament.

491
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,380
And I messaged Kony.

492
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
I was like, you're going to be fighting against Bropo.

493
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,180
You're going to do a tank 1v1.

494
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,080
Are you really going to let Bropo diff you?

495
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:17,500
Like, I'm going to be like, Kony, are you really going to let Bropo diff you on tank, Kony?

496
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,500
So, so, so I messaged Kony that.

497
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,020
I haven't got a reply back yet.

498
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,660
So, like, I hope that's, like, enough motivation.

499
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,580
For Kony to, like, fucking beat his ass.

500
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:47,260
I hope, I hope, I hope that motivates Kony to, like, work even harder.

501
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,000
Sorry, guys.

502
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,680
I just wanted to give you guys, like, a life, like, just an update on everything.

503
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,920
I realized the update was, like, 35 minutes long, guys.

504
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,840
I'm sorry.

505
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,240
So, I hope we get, guys, legitimately, I hope we get top 4, guys.

506
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,340
That's all I wanted.

507
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,260
That's all I want.

508
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,520
Because top 4, top 4 is, like, 2k for each team.

509
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,900
And, like, oh, wait, no.

510
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,260
Top 4 is 3k.

511
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,320
So, like, it's not that, it's, like, just 2k less, you know?

512
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,000
So, like, top 4 would be pretty good as well, you know?

513
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,500
It's out of, by the way, it's out of 12 teams.

514
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,260
So, um, so, like, there's a lot of teams that we're competing against.

515
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,420
Uh, but, yeah.

516
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,740
Anyway, that's life update.

517
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,960
There's a lot of other update stuff, but, like, I'll keep that for another time.

518
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,100
Um, Paladin Knight, thank you for the super chat.

519
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,980
Thank you, thank you.

520
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,980
Doki's team has all the hype, talent, big favorites to win.

521
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,560
What if this turns into a one-and-done team on day one, like, in sports?

522
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,020
Thank you for the super chat.

523
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,300
Thank you, thank you.

524
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,500
No, I just, please, I just, at best, I just want to get top 4.

525
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,200
That's all.

526
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,060
I created, I got, I got a team, guys.

527
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,840
I went full Avengers mode.

528
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,160
I was like, this, I, I went full Avengers mode for this.

529
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,160
I assembled a team.

530
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,800
I got rulebooked, guys.

531
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,480
Um, Simple Minded, thank you for the super chat.

532
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,280
Thank you, thank you.

533
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,840
Doki's a sweaty try-hard confirmed.

534
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,200
Thank you for the super chat.

535
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,980
Thank you, thank you.

536
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,320
Rodrigo, thank you for the super chat.

537
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:33,940
Thank you, thank you.

538
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,580
They're definitely gonna amend the rules next time because of Doki.

539
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,560
It's on them, those suckers.

540
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,380
Thank you for the super chat.

541
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,880
Thank you, thank you.

542
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,380
Um, I, I can't help it if I see a loophole.

543
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,060
You know damn well I'm gonna abuse that shit.

544
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,720
Like, like, that's what, that's what loopholes are for.

545
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,620
You got, that's why you gotta be very clear with your rules, guys.

546
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,380
You know, where I will find a way to cheese it.

547
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,760
I'm a cheeser, we all know that.

548
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,720
And that's why I think a lot of teams really are, really don't like my team.

549
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:15,160
Because a lot of teams, they, they like the really try-hard, the really like scary teams.

550
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,180
The ones that I know, the ones that I do know, like from their roster.

551
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:25,920
Because like the staff, like when I was like grabbing my team, I asked the staff like, how sweaty are the other teams?

552
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,660
Like, how competitive are these other teams?

553
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,140
So I know who to grab, like who, like if I should go full try or not.

554
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,340
Um, so one of the things I noticed is that some teams, one of the teams are like super scary.

555
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,660
But then the two members are actually flat or gold.

556
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,520
Like, so I'm like, whoa, whoops.

557
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,300
So it really, really depends on the two flat and below players.

558
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
Um, to be fair, Cody's actually flat.

559
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:00,600
He just never got past, uh, he just never got past like flat because he stopped playing.

560
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:06,540
But like, I feel like he has a lot of potential to be really, really good at the game.

561
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,640
Doki, you!

562
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:24,260
So, so I was like, oh man, I'm pretty sure, uh, I'm pretty sure Cody has a potential to be really, really, really good at the game.

563
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,760
If he actually like plays and practice and like gets coached by Hogs.

564
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:35,420
Anyway, um, anyway, uh, finally, we're about to play the game, guys.

565
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,660
For real, it's game time.

566
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,060
It's, it's gaming time.

567
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,440
Okay, so we'll see, we'll see on day one how well we do.

568
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:52,260
And then I'll realize, after day one, I'll, I'll see how, after day one, I'll realize what, what's, what's it gonna be like.

569
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,420
So, top four, guys.

570
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,820
Top four is my, top four is like, uh, my ideal goal here.

571
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,160
I don't want to say first place because I don't want to put too much pressure on myself.

572
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,980
So top four, top four.

573
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,340
Um, all right, new game.

574
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,100
Um, but yeah, at 10 p.m., I'm gonna be streaming on Twitch tonight at 10 p.m.

575
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:18,700
And, um, and I'm gonna do like some Twitch Rivals practice with like some of my teammates.

576
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,000
Uh, all right, what is this?

577
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:30,920
Okay, so apparently, context-wise, uh, this game is, uh, this game is made by the Finns.

578
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:47,720
And then when I saw people commenting on my schedule, they're like, Oh, and my, my stream post, my stream tweet, people were like, She doesn't know that the Finns made a real simulator game.

579
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,080
Finland is about to show her what she's got.

580
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,420
Finland's gonna teach her something today.

581
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,360
So, I'm a little scared.

582
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,860
Um, I'm a little, little scared about this.

583
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,700
Do I need a picture?

584
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,300
How do I start the game?

585
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,200
Guys, first off, how the fuck do I start the game?

586
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,360
Okay, um, I'm gonna...

587
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,620
It is apparently very realistic.

588
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,180
Uh, oh, where's the enter name?

589
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,600
Here?

590
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
Oh, okay.

591
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,460
Okay, real.

592
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,720
Uh, oh, wait, okay.

593
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,640
Doki.

594
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,380
Real.

595
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,940
All right, real doki.

596
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,000
Okay, real doki.

597
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,460
All right, so they'll know.

598
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,140
All right, let's begin.

599
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,500
I couldn't tell, it's not that informative.

600
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,960
It's not, it's not that informative, guys.

601
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,880
It's a little hard to feel.

602
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,720
What the fuck is this hole?

603
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,880
Is this, am I being given birth right now?

604
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,600
And then God said, you will love cars.

605
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,960
Oh my God.

606
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,420
My gosh, oh my God, is that a foot?

607
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,220
Am

608
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,350
I...

609
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,110
Wait, wait.

610
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,370
Oh my God, wait.

611
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,430
Oh my God, no way.

612
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,710
Oh my God, oh

613
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,620
fuck.

614
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,320
Oh my...

615
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,020
I've been, I've been birthed.

616
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,500
I didn't think it was that.

617
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,480
I thought it was a joke.

618
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,580
Oh my God, happy birthday.

619
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,920
What, it was true.

620
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,740
Oh my God, no wonder I love real.

621
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,300
What, I'm so bored.

622
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,180
Real was born.

623
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,900
So real, happy birthday.

624
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,280
Guys, when is my birth, guys?

625
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,000
Real.

626
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,840
You are made real.

627
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,780
Happy birthday.

628
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,700
And that's why I love cars.

629
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,700
I was born in the car and I shall die in the car.

630
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,780
Apparently,

631
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,980
this game is really, it's like a couple years old but like it got out of early access recently.

632
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,320
Cause I saw like, I was like, wait, I've seen people play this game before but I don't really know what it's about because I never really watched it.

633
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:40,960
1976.

634
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,380
Damn, that's a long time.

635
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,100
It was made in 2016?

636
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,400
Holy shit, it's been in early access for fucking ever.

637
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,320
Rodrigo, thank you for the superchat.

638
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,220
Thank you, thank you.

639
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,940
NF, so when is the 65484KM stream?

640
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,240
Thank you for the superchat.

641
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,480
Thank you, thank you.

642
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,700
Is it... am I still gonna be driving?

643
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,960
When does it end?

644
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,480
When is this intro gonna end?

645
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,800
Like... hello?

646
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:19,430
Wait a minute, this... oh my god!

647
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,030
Oh!

648
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,070
Sorry, I didn't... I thought I was still watching an intro.

649
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,360
Oh my god, we could've been here forever and nobody said that.

650
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,320
I would legitimately just... wait.

651
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,420
Wait, this is a survival game?

652
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,300
Why do I... I thought I was just building a car.

653
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,820
Oh, wait.

654
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,880
Oh, she doesn't know.

655
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,360
I actually don't know.

656
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,860
Oh, she actually doesn't know.

657
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,840
I thought I was just driving a...

658
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,040
I thought I was supposed to make a car.

659
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,140
What do you mean?

660
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,220
Wait a minute.

661
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,640
Okay, contrast, car mirrors.

662
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,160
Show... I don't need to show FPS, but my sensitivity for this game is so high that I can't adjust it.

663
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,300
Oh, wait.

664
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,080
I didn't realize.

665
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:09,760
What?

666
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,360
What the fuck?

667
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,700
What the fuck is Quaremus?

668
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,740
Oh, he's Garfield!

669
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,420
Oh, this is my room.

670
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,980
This is definitely my room.

671
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,720
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

672
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,920
Thank you, thank you.

673
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,800
Doki didn't have to get spanked by a doctor because Doki died in Apollo.

674
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,040
Let's go.

675
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,320
Thank you for the super chat, Wings.

676
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,080
Thank you, thank you.

677
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,460
This is definitely my home.

678
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,560
Where's my car?

679
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,560
Oh, there's my car!

680
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,660
Oh, am I rebuilding my childhood car?

681
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,980
That shouldn't be too bad.

682
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,000
If it's like... if it's like my old car.

683
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,100
Alright.

684
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,300
How do I... build it, though?

685
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,060
Dashboard meter.

686
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,920
Browse parts catalog.

687
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,080
Alright.

688
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,780
Why is this all in Finnish?

689
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,200
How the fuck am I supposed to read this?

690
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,060
What the fuck does...

691
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,320
Do I not have an English?

692
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,480
Am I supposed to know what that means?

693
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,420
Because you're in...

694
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,980
Yeah, but they should gear it towards me, a Canadian!

695
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,480
I'm an NA!

696
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:31,120
You know how like when Americans visit like places in other countries?

697
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:38,980
And then they be like, why aren't they catering towards me, an American, speaking English?

698
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,060
Why don't they speak English in this country?

699
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,860
Why don't they speak English in Finland?

700
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,520
How will I understand?

701
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,260
How am I supposed to understand if they do not speak English?

702
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,280
You do not want my American dollars?

703
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,660
Oh shit, I can drink?

704
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,080
What's this?

705
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,140
My notepad.

706
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,000
What if I want to drink, though?

707
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,720
Don't you mean that?

708
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,280
You're right.

709
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,760
My soon-to-be American dollars?

710
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,480
You're right.

711
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,340
You're so right.

712
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,140
Oh, okay.

713
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,700
I don't think I need any food yet.

714
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,780
I'm not hungry yet.

715
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,260
Alright, let's figure out how to...

716
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,440
Oh, F is to interact?

717
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,260
Ooh, you know what I'm gonna do.

718
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,520
It's not building a car if you don't drink on the job.

719
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,440
Guys.

720
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,700
True American experience in Finland.

721
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,880
Getting drunk to build my fucking engine.

722
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,040
Wait, what's this?

723
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,000
Alright.

724
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,160
Alright, so true.

725
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,700
So fucking true.

726
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,100
Alright, how do I build an engine?

727
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,660
Oh, I'm feeling a little drunk.

728
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,020
Okay, do I have, like, any instructions on how to build it?

729
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:47,700
Is there...

730
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,560
Is there any instructions at all?

731
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,700
Or am I...

732
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,200
Am I potentially fucked?

733
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,380
No.

734
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,540
Alright, let's figure it out.

735
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,200
Can't be that hard, right?

736
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,240
Building an engine?

737
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,960
Alright, how do I piece things together?

738
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,420
Radio, electric...

739
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,400
How do I piece things together, though?

740
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,300
We rawdog it?

741
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,720
Okay, we rawdog it.

742
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,900
Alright, what if I just put this here?

743
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,260
That looks like it belongs in a car, right?

744
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,180
Is that how you do it?

745
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,120
Do I just, like, chuck it in like that?

746
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,560
Is that an engine part right here?

747
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,080
What is this?

748
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,940
What is this over here?

749
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,520
Radiator... Oh, I know what a radiator is!

750
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,700
That belongs in a car!

751
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,280
That's part of the engine!

752
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,100
I just... That's all I have to do, right?

753
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,280
The radiator is part of the engine too, right?

754
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,240
No, no, we'll be fine.

755
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,300
Oh, there it is!

756
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:57,860
That's an engine!

757
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,760
I know what an engine looks like!

758
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,560
That's an engine right here!

759
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,440
Alright, and then we put you in.

760
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,360
Okay, there we go.

761
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:09,840
We're cooking.

762
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,220
Alright, that's the engine block.

763
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,120
Okay, so like...

764
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,280
There it is.

765
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,400
And then...

766
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,760
Alright, let's get the radiator out.

767
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,940
I don't know if I'm supposed to just... I don't know if it, like, auto...

768
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,000
I feel like it doesn't auto let me pick it.

769
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,280
Oh no, now it's stuck.

770
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:28,600
Okay.

771
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,700
No, no, no, no!

772
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,700
Okay, so there's stuff that has to fit...

773
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,820
It has to be this, right?

774
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,780
The rocker shaft?

775
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,380
Or like... No, no, no, because there's holes in there!

776
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,100
So it has to be... The piston!

777
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:42,860
Yes!

778
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,700
That's right!

779
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,660
Alright, how do I rotate this?

780
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,640
Alright, so...

781
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,960
The piston obviously has to go in here.

782
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,920
But how do I put this in here?

783
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,800
Because that fits!

784
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,180
The circle block fits into the...

785
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,220
Fits into the circle hole.

786
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,360
Right?

787
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,360
That's what it's for!

788
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,920
It's circular!

789
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,280
That's what holes are for!

790
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,520
Okay.

791
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,380
Okay, it's not...

792
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,840
Wait, it's piston hole number 2.

793
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,160
Does that mean it goes in number 2?

794
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,140
Maybe it just goes in the second hole.

795
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,580
Maybe.

796
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,620
The circle block fits in the circle hole.

797
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,640
Okay, not that hole.

798
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,600
Maybe it's this one?

799
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,280
Nope.

800
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,520
Okay, it's rejecting it.

801
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,820
It's rejecting it.

802
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,120
Okay.

803
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,420
And then...

804
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,000
What does it connect to?

805
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,940
Like, how do I connect this to this?

806
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,140
Oh my god.

807
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,240
Wait, actually...

808
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,820
Maybe if I can... Okay, I need to grab this.

809
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,700
How do I grab this part of the car?

810
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,520
We're gonna figure this out, guys!

811
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,760
I can build a car!

812
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,500
I just need to figure out how to get rid of these item stacks and put in here.

813
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,620
Okay, let me...

814
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,460
Put this here.

815
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,420
Guys, this game is not very intuitive.

816
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,200
Alright.

817
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,640
So...

818
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,600
Now that I have my engine block...

819
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,360
I put you in.

820
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,000
Wherever an engine's supposed to go.

821
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,340
Oh, I have to use the bench?

822
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,620
A floor can... Oh my god, we don't need a fucking table.

823
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,980
Why do we need a table when we can use the floor?

824
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,360
A floor is just a table with no legs.

825
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,660
Like, it's just a waste of time.

826
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:32,780
Okay.

827
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,380
Alright.

828
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,180
Okay, and then we gotta rotate...

829
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,300
How the fuck do I rotate this?

830
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:42,900
Oh my god.

831
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,300
How come I can only rotate...

832
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,120
Why can I only rotate it to the side?

833
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,040
Oh my god, please.

834
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,580
How do I rotate it other way?

835
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,740
Okay, there we go.

836
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,160
There we go.

837
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,520
I just have to keep dropping it.

838
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:03,960
Um...

839
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,620
There.

840
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,080
Why is you not piecing together?

841
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,860
You're a circle and you're a circle!

842
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,120
You're meant to be!

843
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,950
Oh my god!

844
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,290
Oh, it's upside down?

845
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:18,570
Oh, that makes so much more sense.

846
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:19,470
Okay, there we go.

847
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,430
Alright, nice.

848
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,370
I knew it.

849
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,550
I knew the circle block would match the circle.

850
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,530
Cause what else could it be?

851
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,510
Alright, and then...

852
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,610
Oh my god, how do I...

853
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,110
How do I rotate you any other way?

854
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:36,550
Ow!

855
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:39,790
How do I rotate you any other way?

856
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,410
Okay, there we go.

857
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,070
The circle hole goes into the circle.

858
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,390
Please go into the hole.

859
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,810
This is where you're meant to be.

860
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:48,630
There we go.

861
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:49,890
Alright.

862
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,510
What the fuck is a crankshaft?

863
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:57,190
Fuel pump, header, start...

864
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,170
The fuck?

865
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,740
Okay, radio, hubcap...

866
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,740
Clock gauge, oil filter...

867
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,920
Rocket shaft...

868
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,100
Drive gear...

869
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,840
Clutch...

870
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,260
Who the fuck cares?

871
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,440
The order never matters anyway, right?

872
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,360
Nobody...

873
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,160
Nobody cares about the order of this...

874
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,560
Fucking...

875
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,020
Building of an engine.

876
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,000
Everything would always work out in the end.

877
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,800
Alright, let's see...

878
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,500
Radio...

879
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,780
Nobody cares.

880
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,000
If people care about the order of how to build an engine...

881
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,340
Why do we have so many cars?

882
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,200
How do I rotate this?

883
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,020
How do I fucking rotate this?

884
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,460
I can only rotate this one way.

885
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,620
I can't...

886
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,220
Okay, if I chuck it...

887
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,000
Maybe it'll fall in a way.

888
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,840
Good point.

889
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:03,980
Alright...

890
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,660
If we care about the order...

891
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,340
Then why do...

892
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,840
Why does only Elon Musk's car explode?

893
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,080
Huh?

894
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,080
That's so fucked.

895
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,900
Did you guys hear about how like...

896
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,880
What's the car?

897
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,400
The really ugly looking one?

898
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:26,200
The Cybertruck?

899
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,940
Yeah, people were like...

900
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,200
People were like...

901
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,720
Oh yeah, it does that sometimes.

902
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,340
I was like, what do you mean?

903
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,420
The Cybertruck just explodes sometimes.

904
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,620
Like, what?

905
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,680
I don't think that's...

906
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,160
I don't think that's like...

907
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,800
I don't think cars are supposed to explode.

908
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,820
Like, yeah, they're like...

909
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,340
No, people are like...

910
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,160
No, people are...

911
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,800
The Cybertruck actually has...

912
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,320
Has like...

913
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,300
It's apparently...

914
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,980
There is a case where the Cybertruck could potentially explode.

915
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,340
I was like, what?

916
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,360
Like...

917
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,920
I know like now people are like...

918
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,120
Oh yeah, but that one was rigged to explode.

919
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,000
But at first, people were like...

920
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,200
Not surprised that it exploded?

921
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,660
And I was like...

922
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,840
What do you mean you're not surprised?

923
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,140
And they're like, oh, it's a Cybertruck.

924
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,820
Apparently, they're known to explode.

925
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,620
But I was like, what?

926
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:23,800
That...

927
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,100
When I...

928
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,440
When I go buy a car...

929
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,120
I'm not...

930
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,720
I don't think I'm looking for a car that explodes.

931
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,880
Oh wait, that's a crankshaft!

932
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,040
There it is!

933
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,340
But where does a crankshaft go?

934
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:40,420
Here?

935
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,340
Oh no!

936
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,600
It's ruined!

937
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,200
Where is it supposed to go?

938
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,080
That's a feature.

939
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,960
That shouldn't be...

940
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,800
How do I put this in you?

941
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,380
Like, is this in you, sir?

942
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,800
Is this inside you right now?

943
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,760
Oh wait, wait, wait!

944
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,720
It should be at the bottom!

945
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,660
Wait, I got it.

946
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,060
It should be on top of this, and then...

947
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,440
But like, how do I...

948
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,620
piece it together?

949
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,310
It should be on the bottom.

950
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,510
Why don't you go inside?

951
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,590
I don't understand.

952
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,110
Oh man, you guys were made for each other!

953
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,530
Please!

954
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,390
I will make this an arranged marriage if I have to.

955
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,290
And then you will be forced to love each other via time.

956
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:30,670
Okay.

957
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:32,410
Let's see.

958
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:33,330
This should be...

959
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,210
Okay, I'm going to put it upside down.

960
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:38,470
And then I'm going to force this marriage upon you.

961
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,090
Oh, there you go!

962
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:40,670
Yay!

963
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:41,890
See?

964
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,870
They'll eventually love each other.

965
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:47,950
There you go.

966
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,970
I told you guys.

967
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:50,190
See?

968
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,710
They were meant to be together.

969
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:53,870
I knew it.

970
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:54,370
Okay.

971
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,730
Guys, I need to figure out how to rotate this.

972
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:00,150
Rotate objects.

973
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:05,090
That does not help at all.

974
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,210
How do I...

975
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,250
Oh wait, I can...

976
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,930
Wait, I can urinate?

977
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:12,610
I can urinate.

978
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,350
I can smoke.

979
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,010
Lean right.

980
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:17,090
Drive.

981
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,950
What the fuck?

982
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,450
Oh, I don't have cigarettes.

983
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,570
I feel like I might need to pee though.

984
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,230
Alright, that's okay.

985
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,210
Wait, I should water the grass.

986
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,670
There we go.

987
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,610
Alright, hydrate my fellow grass.

988
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,590
Don't worry.

989
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,230
I watered the garden.

990
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,470
Alright.

991
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:45,490
Let's see.

992
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:46,510
Okay, we got this.

993
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,470
How do I fucking rotate this better?

994
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,510
I'm so fucking...

995
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:51,830
Okay.

996
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:56,390
Like, it won't let me fucking...

997
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,150
Okay, it's fine.

998
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,210
I'm calm.

999
00:55:58,790 --> 00:55:59,130
Alright.

1000
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:03,490
Okay, now that I got...

1001
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:04,950
Maybe the rocket shaft?

1002
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,950
That sounds like something for an engine, right?

1003
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:10,490
No?

1004
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:11,850
Okay.

1005
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:13,910
It's not this.

1006
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,430
Is it N?

1007
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:20,610
Oh.

1008
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:22,690
Okay.

1009
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,410
Instead, I just called it a pussy.

1010
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:25,490
Oh, there we go!

1011
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:26,130
I did it!

1012
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:29,070
Wait, what?

1013
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,470
It was...

1014
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,510
Wait, what the fuck?

1015
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,550
It gave me a check mark...

1016
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,130
and then it didn't piece together.

1017
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,530
Oh, no.

1018
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,530
Why can't you...

1019
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:45,690
How do I...

1020
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:47,770
Please...

1021
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,530
How do you...

1022
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:51,770
How do I put you together?

1023
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,410
You're meant to be!

1024
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,210
These are your kids!

1025
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,470
These are your kids!

1026
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,830
No, and then I took it!

1027
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,530
You can take it out!

1028
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,090
Okay.

1029
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:07,190
There we go.

1030
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:07,950
I put it back in.

1031
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,890
And then...

1032
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,710
Oh, my God.

1033
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,170
How the fuck get in?

1034
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,150
How do I rotate it better?

1035
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,900
Oh, my God.

1036
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,560
It only lets me...

1037
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,580
Why does it only let me rotate one way?

1038
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,500
Why do you only let me rotate one way?

1039
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,040
There has to be another rotation.

1040
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,640
There has to be another way to rotate.

1041
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,600
I refuse to believe...

1042
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,080
That there's only one rotate.

1043
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,960
There's no fucking way.

1044
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,860
Where are the other rotations?

1045
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,740
I'm crashing out.

1046
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,040
I'm gonna crash out.

1047
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,160
It's not even been like...

1048
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,780
I feel like it's not even been 10 minutes on this stupid fucking car.

1049
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,100
I'm gonna crash out.

1050
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:06,960
I'm gonna crash out.

1051
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,660
I am using my middle mouse button.

1052
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,100
But it only lets me rotate...

1053
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,080
Up and down.

1054
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,980
Where's the sideways?

1055
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,480
Where's the...

1056
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,220
Oh, my God.

1057
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:18,980
I'm leaning in.

1058
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,840
I'm gonna pass out.

1059
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,020
Let me try turning it on and off again.

1060
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,400
No, I don't need a tutorial.

1061
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,300
I'm gonna make an engine.

1062
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,740
It's the last thing I do.

1063
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,520
I don't need a tutorial.

1064
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,080
I can do this.

1065
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,720
I can make a fucking car.

1066
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,140
How hard can it be?

1067
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,560
You don't need degrees for this.

1068
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,630
I'm gonna force my way into a car.

1069
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:49,290
I was born in a car.

1070
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:51,730
I was made to have a car.

1071
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:52,910
Oh, yeah, water pump.

1072
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,490
I was born and I shall die in a fucking car.

1073
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:00,330
Okay.

1074
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:00,470
Okay.

1075
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,710
Got this.

1076
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:07,790
I feel like there's so many holes for no reason.

1077
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,270
Let me grab...

1078
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,710
Like, what am I supposed to do with a spinner set?

1079
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,890
The fuck is up bearings?

1080
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:41,710
Battery, radiator, hose, inspecting, gearbox, rocker shaft, clutch, clutch plate, engine plate, drive gear, shatter, headers, fuel pump, water pump.

1081
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:43,750
Oh, that's a bearing?

1082
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:45,130
Okay.

1083
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,170
Chat makes a car.

1084
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:49,490
This is today's stream.

1085
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:52,370
Okay, where does the bearing go?

1086
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:53,710
Does the bearing go in a hole?

1087
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,130
Where is it supposed to go?

1088
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,410
Does it go into the hole?

1089
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:02,850
Or does it go here?

1090
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,250
Is this where it goes?

1091
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:06,330
I wish...

1092
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:08,610
I wish I can rotate this any other way.

1093
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:09,350
I...

1094
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:13,450
I wish I can...

1095
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,430
Does it go into the...

1096
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,170
Does it go onto this?

1097
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:22,670
Why don't you go in?

1098
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,740
Oh, there it is.

1099
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,360
Oh!

1100
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,720
That's where you go in.

1101
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,440
Told you, you would love each other eventually.

1102
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,700
I knew you would love each other.

1103
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,780
Okay, now I should be able to put this in.

1104
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,440
Right?

1105
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,220
Are you serious?

1106
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,160
I have to bolt it in place?

1107
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,080
It's already fucking...

1108
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,620
connected.

1109
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,450
Am I bolting?

1110
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:00,810
Is this how you use tools?

1111
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:03,930
Bolt together.

1112
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,150
I demand you to get in.

1113
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:08,510
I...

1114
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:10,390
Now kiss.

1115
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:11,750
Now...

1116
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:15,930
I...

1117
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,670
I demand you to fit together.

1118
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,310
Did I do it?

1119
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:25,890
What did I do?

1120
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:28,110
What the fuck is two?

1121
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,030
Oh, it's car tool mode.

1122
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:32,510
How do I use my car tools?

1123
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,190
Am I using it?

1124
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,400
Am I?

1125
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:47,680
Oh!

1126
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,900
Is it this one?

1127
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:57,590
I don't know which size it is.

1128
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:59,350
Is it a tiny size?

1129
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,670
Is it size three?

1130
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:04,950
Is it size four?

1131
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:05,770
Oh, it's size four.

1132
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:09,330
No?

1133
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:11,830
Size five?

1134
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,530
How small are you?

1135
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,230
Oh my god.

1136
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:20,470
Are you smaller?

1137
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:23,570
Do you need a little small wrench, little guy?

1138
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:34,170
Okay, it's size four, but like...

1139
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,810
Oh, it's even smaller?

1140
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:37,970
Do you feel...

1141
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:42,090
Oh!

1142
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:43,810
Oh no!

1143
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:46,610
I'm trying to figure this out as soon as you guys!

1144
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,520
Wait, I need one more bearing?

1145
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,460
Where the fuck is this third bearing supposed to go?

1146
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:56,800
Oh, here.

1147
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,380
Okay.

1148
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:00,960
Okay.

1149
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,220
It was this size, it was the fourth one.

1150
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,840
No, it was the smaller.

1151
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,200
Wait, what?

1152
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:13,860
It's smaller?

1153
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,960
What size was it?

1154
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:22,330
Okay.

1155
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,810
This is not intuitive right now at all.

1156
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:27,270
Finnish people, how the...

1157
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,510
Do you like fun?

1158
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,730
Are you...

1159
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:36,410
Is seasonal depression that bad that this is fun?

1160
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,350
Is the lack of...

1161
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,550
Did the lack of sun fuck you up?

1162
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,450
How...

1163
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,350
This is fun.

1164
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:50,610
Is this what happens when you don't see the sun 90% of your life?

1165
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,630
Like, I don't understand.

1166
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:55,570
I'm Finnish.

1167
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:56,730
I'm sorry.

1168
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:00,270
This is fun in Finland.

1169
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:07,430
The urge to build an engine with no rule, nothing to help you.

1170
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:09,970
How do I figure this?

1171
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:12,510
How am I supposed to figure this out on my own?

1172
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,070
I don't understand.

1173
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:19,550
Why is screwing in the screws a fucking scroll wheel?

1174
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:22,950
Why the fuck is it scroll wheel?

1175
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,930
This is where the fun begins.

1176
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:37,010
It's like 99% of the population in Finland fucking engineers?

1177
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,850
Are you guys all mechanics?

1178
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:40,310
What is this?

1179
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:44,290
You can't graduate university until you build your own fucking car?

1180
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:50,230
That's the magic of this game.

1181
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,570
We are the happiest country in the world.

1182
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:54,510
FYI.

1183
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:59,930
Oh my god.

1184
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:03,110
The simple things make you happy.

1185
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,330
Yes.

1186
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:16,470
Every Finnish people is born in a fucking car.

1187
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:17,530
Apparently.

1188
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,370
Okay.

1189
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:23,410
Now that we got the whatever fucking bungles in.

1190
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,750
Now I should be able to fit this.

1191
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:27,250
Oh my god.

1192
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,790
Fucking finally.

1193
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:33,070
The circle hole can finally go into the circle.

1194
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,430
Whenever I figure this out.

1195
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:37,010
There we go.

1196
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:38,270
Oh my god.

1197
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,710
It can finally go into the circle hole.

1198
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:45,490
Thank god I figured it out.

1199
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:46,830
I did it.

1200
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:49,790
I'm almost like 1% Finnish now.

1201
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:50,650
At this point.

1202
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:54,130
If you fucking complete an engine, you become Finnish.

1203
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:55,890
Okay.

1204
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:58,130
Come on.

1205
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,290
Go in the hole.

1206
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,670
Go in the hole.

1207
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:06,150
How?

1208
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:06,910
Oh my god.

1209
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:07,870
I'm crashing.

1210
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:12,090
I don't understand why I can only rotate it in one direction.

1211
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:13,430
I should be allowed.

1212
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:18,890
You made a very detailed car building simulator.

1213
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:22,150
But you can't rotate an item left and right.

1214
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:23,670
I don't understand.

1215
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:26,530
How do you have all these fucking parts?

1216
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:28,210
A fucking water pump.

1217
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,970
A water pump pulley.

1218
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:31,830
A fucking carbonator.

1219
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:35,170
But you can't rotate an item left or right.

1220
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:35,730
How?

1221
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:45,040
Like, I feel like this was the most simple thing to add in the rule.

1222
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:55,670
I don't want much.

1223
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:58,250
I just want to be able to rotate left or right.

1224
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,170
That's all I asked for.

1225
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,130
Like, left or right.

1226
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,930
Not just up or down.

1227
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,570
Tiny, thank you for the super chat.

1228
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:08,830
Thank you, thank you.

1229
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:11,290
This is why mechanics charge so much.

1230
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:15,730
They spend years learning how to rotate parts.

1231
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,390
Thank you for the super chat.

1232
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:21,550
Thank you, thank you.

1233
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:24,450
You're only finished when you get the car.

1234
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:28,630
If you cannot make your own car, you're fucking you get deported from the country.

1235
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:40,810
Like, whenever a Finnish person hits the age of 18, they are required to go through the mandatory government test, where you have to build a car, and if you don't build a car, you're deported to Sweden.

1236
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:50,150
Damn, she gets it now.

1237
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:57,170
Jen, thank you for the super chat.

1238
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:58,690
Your very first super chat.

1239
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,090
Thank you, thank you.

1240
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:03,610
Doki's getting a taste of the car building experience.

1241
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:06,690
Anchor, also second first super chat.

1242
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:08,710
Thank you for the super chat.

1243
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:10,370
Thank you, thank you.

1244
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:15,450
Doki, thank you for the very first super chat.

1245
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:16,170
Thank you, thank you.

1246
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:17,430
Doki, you think this is bad?

1247
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:22,670
Just wait till you tune the engine, or when something breaks you need to take the- I HAVE TO TAKE THIS APART?!

1248
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,880
FUCKING PUT THREE PIECES TOGETHER!

1249
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,840
Like, what are you- It took me 30 minutes!

1250
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,840
IT TOOK ME 10 MINUTES TO ROTATE ONE ITEM!

1251
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,580
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVE TO TAKE THIS APART?!

1252
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,880
Oh my god.

1253
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,540
Alright, I'm okay.

1254
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,480
I'm okay.

1255
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,240
Alright.

1256
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,480
Pretty sure the pet gasket has to go on top of this, right?

1257
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:48,780
It's the same shape.

1258
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:49,860
Yeah, alright.

1259
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,120
That sounds right.

1260
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,100
It's the same shape.

1261
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,100
It looks the same.

1262
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,760
It should be good.

1263
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,360
Okay, and then... I have- I don't know.

1264
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,800
I just thought, like, same shape.

1265
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,380
So it should be...

1266
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:02,240
It should be the same.

1267
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,380
Okay.

1268
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,440
I got this.

1269
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,660
Okay, I know hubcaps are for the wheels.

1270
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:08,260
Alright.

1271
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,520
Distributor.

1272
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:12,780
Uh...

1273
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,400
Water pump.

1274
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,220
Oil pan.

1275
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,460
Cylinder head.

1276
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,040
The fuck does all of this mean?

1277
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,440
Does the rocket shaft go in here?

1278
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,920
Is that what it's for?

1279
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,020
There are also holes.

1280
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,200
There are still holes here.

1281
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,980
What do you mean I have to bolt more stuff down?

1282
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,760
What the fuck do you mean by that?

1283
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,700
It's- Oh my god, no.

1284
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,220
Don't listen to them.

1285
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,440
Don't listen to them.

1286
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,780
They don't know what- Not all of them are finished.

1287
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,640
They could be fucking with you.

1288
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,140
Oh my god.

1289
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:44,640
Thank god.

1290
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:44,940
Okay.

1291
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,760
Now I should be bolting things down, right?

1292
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,180
That should be, right?

1293
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,320
Okay.

1294
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:51,340
Alright.

1295
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,700
I'll find the screwdriver.

1296
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:58,300
The spanner or whatever the fuck that screwdriver was.

1297
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,300
This is the wrench.

1298
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,580
The wrench that will fit this.

1299
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:02,720
Right?

1300
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:06,240
There's a wrench that fits this, right?

1301
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:07,920
Oh my god.

1302
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,720
This is why I Uber.

1303
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,600
This is exactly why I Uber.

1304
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,920
Ah, fuck it.

1305
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,500
Nothing needs to be screwed down forever.

1306
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:22,880
If I have to take it apart, I don't- If I never- If I have to take it apart, what's the point of screwing things down?

1307
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:24,880
Okay.

1308
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,480
Alright.

1309
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,700
Now, now I should be able to screw things down, right?

1310
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:33,600
No?

1311
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,520
So true.

1312
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:36,660
That's all I'm saying.

1313
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,220
Like, what's the point- Oh, there it is.

1314
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:40,360
Okay.

1315
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,540
Is that down?

1316
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:43,420
Okay.

1317
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,480
Should be it.

1318
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,800
Okay, now I can't break apart.

1319
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,160
I did it.

1320
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,340
Okay, I did it.

1321
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:53,640
Okay, I did it.

1322
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,700
My god, I fucking finally did it.

1323
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,640
I'm gonna build my own- Can I die?

1324
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,410
Wait a minute.

1325
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:08,430
Wait a minute.

1326
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:13,750
I'm just like thinking, what if I just fucking not eat?

1327
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,790
Wait a minute.

1328
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,630
Oh my god, this is actual hell.

1329
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:21,750
I can actually die.

1330
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,210
Should I have used a 3D model?

1331
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:28,390
You want to rotate?

1332
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:31,350
David, thank you for the super chat.

1333
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:32,530
Thank you, thank you.

1334
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,370
Jake, thank you for the super chat.

1335
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:35,070
Thank you, thank you.

1336
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:40,070
I can watch GTA Pro tags steal cars down to avoid this.

1337
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,650
Thank you for the super chat, Jake.

1338
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:42,650
Thank you, thank you.

1339
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,250
Jesus, thank you for the super chat.

1340
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:44,990
Thank you, thank you.

1341
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:46,290
Pro finish strategy.

1342
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:49,670
Don't screw everything down so the engine can disassemble itself for you.

1343
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:50,250
Exactly!

1344
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,110
What's the point of screwing everything down?

1345
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:54,530
We're gonna take it apart anyway.

1346
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,950
Like, it's a waste of time.

1347
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:02,730
The car- The hood of the car can keep everything together.

1348
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:11,970
If we stuff the entire engine area, the hood of the car, with everything, nothing can come apart because it's all like clumped up together.

1349
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:16,690
How can- How can it come apart if everything's squished together?

1350
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:22,680
Alright.

1351
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,720
How am I stressed?

1352
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,340
How are you stressed out?

1353
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,320
I say as I scream at him.

1354
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,600
How- What?

1355
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,260
You don't need to go to school.

1356
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,400
You're just building a car.

1357
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,280
You're just building a fucking car.

1358
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,560
How are you stressed out?

1359
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,580
You don't have to do anything else.

1360
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,480
I bet you live with your parents.

1361
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,060
How are you stressed out?

1362
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:48,320
You live- You barely have Garfield in your- You do not live alone.

1363
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,020
You don't have to pay bills.

1364
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,200
You don't- All you do in your life is build a fucking car.

1365
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,500
That's all.

1366
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,160
How are you stressed?

1367
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,640
Doki said calmly.

1368
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,380
You live with your parents.

1369
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,280
You have zero bills to pay.

1370
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:06,120
How the fuck are you stressed out?

1371
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:11,260
Doki, please.

1372
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,960
Doki asked calmly.

1373
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,120
Calmly.

1374
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,260
Oh my god.

1375
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,060
Alright.

1376
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:18,900
Okay.

1377
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:20,640
Alright.

1378
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,860
That should be everything.

1379
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,760
And then...

1380
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,180
Okay.

1381
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:30,160
And then...

1382
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:30,780
What else?

1383
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:31,800
Gearbox.

1384
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:32,880
Linkage.

1385
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:33,640
Battery.

1386
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,520
Radiator.

1387
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,260
Hose.

1388
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,660
The fuck is next?

1389
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,800
On my car?

1390
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,940
Does this cover it?

1391
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,040
Oh, okay.

1392
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,800
I did it.

1393
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:45,840
Did I finish my engine?

1394
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:49,120
Wait, guys, did I just finish my engine?

1395
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,080
Is that it?

1396
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,830
Okay, let me make sure there's nothing else.

1397
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:03,810
There's more to this, but there's nothing else I could put on it!

1398
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:06,850
Requiring mass.

1399
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:11,530
Uh...

1400
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,570
Oh my god, that's not good.

1401
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:21,370
If a speedrun is more than 10 minutes, that's when you know I'm in for a fucking wild ride.

1402
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,070
The fuck?

1403
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:33,230
What else does this need?

1404
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:36,390
What more do you want from me?

1405
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,110
Oh my god.

1406
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,370
What's gonna happen to my fridge?

1407
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:48,450
Oh, there's no way this simulator has...

1408
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:54,250
There's no way this simulator makes it so that my electricity bill goes up by... I can't even close the fridge.

1409
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:56,050
My electricity bill goes up.

1410
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:57,190
Don't be lazy.

1411
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:58,330
Fix your old...

1412
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,130
Dad's old car.

1413
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:00,810
Don't drink alcohol.

1414
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:01,890
We will come back with...

1415
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:03,390
We can't pour it.

1416
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:03,870
Whoops.

1417
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:05,470
Um...

1418
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:07,010
Okay, gotta hide the...

1419
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,510
I gotta hide the evidence.

1420
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:12,010
Uh...

1421
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:13,010
Why have a sauna?

1422
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:15,070
How fucking rich am I?

1423
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,050
I do live in the middle of the woods.

1424
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,730
So...

1425
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,010
What the fuck?

1426
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,070
Okay, mom and pops won't know that I drink beer.

1427
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:25,470
Am I over 18?

1428
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,370
Okay.

1429
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:28,390
No, I should be.

1430
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:30,510
I'm doing my mandatory government...

1431
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:32,150
You know how, like, in...

1432
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:35,230
Korea, you have to enlist in the army at age 18?

1433
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:39,530
In Finland, you gotta take your mandatory car building test.

1434
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:40,250
And if you...

1435
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:43,350
Like I said, if you don't make it, you get deported to Sweden.

1436
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:44,830
Like...

1437
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:53,930
Alright.

1438
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:56,770
So it's just like that.

1439
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,120
Alright, let's see.

1440
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,120
We're real Finland.

1441
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:09,440
Okay.

1442
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:09,620
Okay.

1443
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,400
What else does this need?

1444
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,640
I don't understand.

1445
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:16,280
An oil filter?

1446
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,060
What do you want from me?

1447
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,280
Like, what do you want from me?

1448
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,580
You're just a block!

1449
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:31,230
Oh my god, like, I don't understand.

1450
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:34,070
What parts fit this?

1451
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,570
What the fuck is a carburetor?

1452
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:39,610
Okay.

1453
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:40,250
Do you fit?

1454
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:43,450
Oh my god.

1455
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:44,790
Water pump pulley?

1456
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:47,930
Okay, maybe if I...

1457
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,790
Oh my god, what if I just do it like the puzzle way?

1458
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:53,510
I'll start mashing parts together, and then...

1459
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:54,770
Oh my god, I knew it.

1460
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:56,570
I'm gonna do it the puzzle way.

1461
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:00,370
I just start mashing random parts together and see if something works.

1462
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:04,410
Oh my god.

1463
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:05,990
Oh, you're so smart, Doki.

1464
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:09,250
Just start mashing things together and something will start to fit.

1465
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:12,950
Oh my god, I knew it.

1466
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,290
The order never matters.

1467
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,110
If the order matters, why didn't they give me instructions?

1468
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,190
Don't worry.

1469
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,150
Everything will be fine.

1470
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,010
It just works.

1471
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,030
Okay, I just need to...

1472
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:31,350
I'm a genius at work.

1473
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:32,590
It's just like making a puzzle.

1474
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:36,410
You start putting things together until things piece together.

1475
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:42,630
Okay, so obviously a radio will need...

1476
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:45,510
A radio would need wires, right?

1477
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:49,810
So like... Oh, what the fuck am I gonna do with a fuel pump?

1478
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,750
The fuck is a gearbox?

1479
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:55,950
What goes in the goddamn fucking gearbox?

1480
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:59,510
Does this go in?

1481
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:00,850
No.

1482
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:03,070
Um...

1483
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:05,490
Okay, maybe something... A distributor?

1484
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:07,190
Do you go together?

1485
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,630
Oh my god, what does it do?

1486
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:11,730
What does it do?

1487
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,710
Do you piece together?

1488
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,050
Gears?

1489
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:18,550
Oh my god, you're so right.

1490
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:22,090
Maybe if I... Oh my god, the engine plate!

1491
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,870
This is the engine.

1492
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:28,670
Okay.

1493
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:30,230
Oh, there we go.

1494
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:31,210
There we go.

1495
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,770
We got one of the engine plates on.

1496
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:36,730
I don't know where the other is supposed to go, but that's alright.

1497
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:38,690
The timing cover?

1498
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:39,930
For what?

1499
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:43,850
Oh!

1500
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:46,570
I can put the gear stick on right now.

1501
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:50,930
But where's the...

1502
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:56,270
Okay, wait.

1503
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:57,930
Can I?

1504
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:59,490
Can I?

1505
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:04,870
There we go.

1506
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:07,390
I told you, it's just like a puzzle!

1507
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:08,870
I can put it in!

1508
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:10,930
There we go!

1509
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:16,270
I fucking knew it!

1510
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:19,090
Oh my god!

1511
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:19,970
I knew it.

1512
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:22,010
I could just put it on right now.

1513
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,450
There we go.

1514
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,370
I'm so smart.

1515
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,990
The gear stick goes in.

1516
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:28,610
I know where gear sticks go to.

1517
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:32,630
Thank you for the very first super chat!

1518
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:32,950
Thank you!

1519
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:37,090
I am a journeyman mechanic with over 12 years experience.

1520
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:42,490
And I'm incredibly amused and also in physical pain watching you try to assemble this engine.

1521
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,170
You can do it.

1522
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,910
I believe in you.

1523
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:46,630
See!

1524
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:48,590
They think I can make a...

1525
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:52,110
I told you guys, I knew I was a genius all along.

1526
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:57,210
If a mechanic says I can fucking do it, then I can do this.

1527
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:01,770
I'm told I'm naturally talented in everything I do.

1528
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,170
Including building an engine.

1529
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:04,350
Okay.

1530
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,970
Now I'm a little stuck right now.

1531
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,150
I'm thirsty.

1532
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,990
I gotta drink some water.

1533
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,970
Is my family never coming home?

1534
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:15,130
How do I drink water?

1535
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:16,950
Do I have cups?

1536
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:19,490
What the fuck am I...

1537
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:20,210
Why can't I...

1538
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:22,730
Am I not allowed to open...

1539
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:23,990
Do I have...

1540
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:26,950
This entire area just like...

1541
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:32,630
Did they just child-proof the entire area that I'm just not allowed to drink anymore?

1542
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:34,810
Like...

1543
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:36,470
How do I close the fridge?

1544
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:39,130
How do I close the fridge?

1545
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,210
Let me close!

1546
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,750
I can't!

1547
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:42,170
Oh my god, please.

1548
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:42,470
Okay.

1549
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:44,150
Oh, I have to lean forward?

1550
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,310
Okay, how do I lean forward?

1551
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:47,710
Lean right.

1552
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:50,470
Lean forward.

1553
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:53,590
E.

1554
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,640
Please, let me lean forward.

1555
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:03,640
Am I drinking?

1556
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,320
Alright, I just...

1557
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,320
I guess I just...

1558
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,900
I'm not allowed to have a cup until I build this car, I guess.

1559
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,220
Alright, give me a sec.

1560
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,860
I need to water the plants real quick.

1561
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:19,430
There you go.

1562
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:22,830
I hope you grow up big and strong for daddy.

1563
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:32,250
You big boy, grow up to be a strong tree, little man.

1564
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,510
The fitness way.

1565
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:39,570
Alright, nice.

1566
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:40,250
I did it.

1567
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:41,950
How am I still stressed out?

1568
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:42,830
I don't understand.

1569
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:45,470
I'm perfectly calm right now.

1570
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:48,410
Realistic?

1571
01:21:48,730 --> 01:21:50,570
It's a fucking real ass simulator.

1572
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:53,290
Okay.

1573
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,430
Carburetor.

1574
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:57,350
Where would a carburetor go?

1575
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,790
Where the fuck is a carburetor?

1576
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:03,290
Thank you for the super chat.

1577
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,510
Thank you.

1578
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:07,010
Is that it?

1579
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,450
Is that everything an engine needs?

1580
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:11,030
Is that it?

1581
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,270
Did I do it?

1582
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,850
I think I did it.

1583
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:15,510
That's everything an engine needs.

1584
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:22,330
Do you think it got in?

1585
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:27,150
Do you think it's in, guys?

1586
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:31,190
Do you think I can drive my car with this now?

1587
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:37,610
It doesn't look right.

1588
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:40,190
It's all covered up.

1589
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:43,610
Oh, just because it's a little dirty, it doesn't look right.

1590
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,430
Well, an engine is like...

1591
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:47,630
An engine is an engine, okay, guys?

1592
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,030
It doesn't matter what it looks on the outside.

1593
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:54,350
It's all about what's on the inside, and I bet you the inside looks amazing.

1594
01:22:57,770 --> 01:22:59,110
What the fuck?

1595
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:00,650
Drive gear.

1596
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:02,470
Timing cover.

1597
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:05,570
Starter.

1598
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:08,110
Electric master cylinder.

1599
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:09,750
The fuck are all these?

1600
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:12,050
I feel like they just made up some of these words.

1601
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:17,410
At this point, some of these words seem made up.

1602
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:19,350
I don't know if they're real or not.

1603
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:24,410
If it's missing some stuff, why can't I fit it in?

1604
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:25,350
Huh?

1605
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:33,390
If it truly is missing things, then why can't I fit it into this engine?

1606
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:35,170
Huh, guys?

1607
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:35,990
Checkmate.

1608
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:38,010
Nothing fits.

1609
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:42,890
Okay, maybe...

1610
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:43,430
Oh!

1611
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,710
Oh!

1612
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:46,690
I did it!

1613
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:49,690
Brute force, let's go!

1614
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:52,270
Until I see...

1615
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:52,850
Oh my god.

1616
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:54,170
There's another gear.

1617
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:57,550
Where did it...

1618
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:59,190
Where does this one go?

1619
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,930
Where is it going to?

1620
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:06,110
I don't know.

1621
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:10,390
It's trying to fit somewhere, but it doesn't know where.

1622
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:17,190
Liz, I know you're supposed to fit!

1623
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:19,630
Oh no.

1624
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:24,390
Wait, maybe this...

1625
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:28,210
Is this?

1626
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:30,890
It's not?

1627
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,030
Okay, maybe it's this.

1628
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:37,830
Because they're both clutches.

1629
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,540
Oh my god, please.

1630
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:45,440
There we go.

1631
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,400
No?

1632
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,000
I did it.

1633
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,780
It should fit now.

1634
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,060
Yes, I did it!

1635
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,020
I'm a fucking genius.

1636
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,400
That's how you know you want your car.

1637
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,020
You prove...

1638
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,700
That's when you know it's a good engine.

1639
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:09,660
When a mechanic makes a puzzle out of it.

1640
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,180
That's when you know.

1641
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:11,220
Oh no.

1642
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:17,120
Don't you love it when your mechanic was like, does it fit?

1643
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,060
If it doesn't fit, it doesn't work.

1644
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:24,900
Wait, clutch master.

1645
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,280
Shouldn't that be over here?

1646
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,620
Is there both clutches?

1647
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:30,980
Is that not it?

1648
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,980
If it's not clutches, where would it go?

1649
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,740
Exactly, if it doesn't fit, it wasn't meant to be.

1650
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:40,840
Wait.

1651
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,600
Oh my god, I did it.

1652
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,000
Wait, it got off.

1653
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,600
Wait, what?

1654
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,720
Wait, why isn't it fitting again?

1655
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,140
How does it just break apart?

1656
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,900
It can do that?

1657
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:54,840
But

1658
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:59,390
I thought you guys fit.

1659
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:07,450
You can just break apart like that?

1660
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:12,290
Oh my god.

1661
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,290
Why don't you fit?

1662
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,990
Did you guys got in a fight?

1663
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:26,410
Please don't get a divorce.

1664
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:28,710
I'll be so sad.

1665
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:32,390
Oh my god.

1666
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:35,350
Oh my god.

1667
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:40,750
If I use Gorilla Glue on an engine, do you think it'll explode?

1668
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:45,110
Cause like, what's the difference between Gorilla Glue and bolting it down?

1669
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:47,230
Are they both like, you know...

1670
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:51,330
Toki, no.

1671
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:54,250
Has anyone tried that?

1672
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:57,070
You know, using Gorilla Glue versus like, bolting...

1673
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:58,690
Okay, I'm padding a bed.

1674
01:26:58,810 --> 01:26:59,390
Fuck this.

1675
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:02,910
Mom and dad can come home and clean up for me.

1676
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:07,190
Where are my cigarettes?

1677
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:10,730
Like, how am I supposed to like, de-stress?

1678
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:17,710
Wait, why was I like...

1679
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:18,510
Oh, yeah.

1680
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:19,390
Oh, yeah.

1681
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:29,450
It's like, oh, yeah.

1682
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:35,450
Oh, wait, wait.

1683
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:36,930
I don't like that.

1684
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:41,750
What?

1685
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:42,730
Wake up.

1686
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:44,470
Wake up.

1687
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:47,410
Hello?

1688
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:47,550
Hello?

1689
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:51,750
Wait, why is it so dark?

1690
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:54,010
Hello?

1691
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:58,690
Wait.

1692
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:01,870
Is it midnight?

1693
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:03,270
But it's Tuesday.

1694
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:05,950
Wait a minute, where am I supposed to go?

1695
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:07,210
Wait a minute.

1696
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:11,970
I forgot.

1697
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:19,310
Because it's Finland, the sun sets down the sun sets down faster.

1698
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:21,730
I forgot about that.

1699
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:25,810
Oh, no, I'm gonna die of stress before the sun comes back out.

1700
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:30,820
Oh, I forgot.

1701
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:36,560
I forgot you guys only get sunlight for two hours a day.

1702
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,340
Might as well.

1703
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,760
Not in summer, the sun doesn't go down.

1704
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,220
I don't know, it feels like winter right now.

1705
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,200
Like, do I just not have windows?

1706
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,480
Like, do I?

1707
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,840
Where the fuck is my window?

1708
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:05,960
Like, would it be illuminated by the fucking stars?

1709
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:12,360
It's like, do stars not exist in Finland?

1710
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:18,560
Dude, they just decided to be like, fuck Finland, there's no stars, I guess.

1711
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,440
Who needs windows?

1712
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,060
It's cloudy, oh yeah.

1713
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:27,040
Today of all days, it's cloudy.

1714
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,660
Oh my god.

1715
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,540
Please, where's the light?

1716
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:35,680
Where am I?

1717
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:36,980
Oh, wait.

1718
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:38,820
There's my poster.

1719
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,480
Oh my god.

1720
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,180
See my poster.

1721
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,740
Can I sleep again?

1722
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:48,540
Wait.

1723
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,420
There's my poster.

1724
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,100
There's the wall.

1725
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,330
What's this?

1726
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:57,790
Is this the light?

1727
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:00,350
Oh.

1728
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:02,030
Is this my door?

1729
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,280
Where's the light?

1730
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,920
Where the fuck is the light?

1731
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,660
Oh no, I don't think I'm ever...

1732
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,200
Oh my god, I found it!

1733
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,380
The fuck are the stars?

1734
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,900
Where's the stars in Finland?

1735
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,600
Alright, now...

1736
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,320
I gotta figure out this area.

1737
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,660
Okay, we gotta take a shower.

1738
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:38,460
Alright.

1739
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,760
Where's the shower area?

1740
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,120
Can I use my parents' shower?

1741
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,200
I couldn't leave Finland.

1742
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,160
Okay, where's...

1743
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:54,580
Okay, that's the outside.

1744
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,800
And then I gotta figure out where the shower...

1745
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,060
Okay, the shower was right here.

1746
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:01,740
Alright.

1747
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,440
And it was like right here.

1748
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,500
I gotta wear stuff.

1749
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,220
No, that's the closet.

1750
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,100
Okay, it's right here.

1751
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,600
There we go.

1752
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,820
And then...

1753
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:15,900
Alright, guys.

1754
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,420
I'm gonna take a shower.

1755
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,060
Hello?

1756
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,240
Please, I'm...

1757
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:23,980
Please, help.

1758
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:25,260
Okay, there we go.

1759
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:26,760
Alright.

1760
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,020
Now I'm clean.

1761
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:29,820
I'm a clean boy.

1762
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,100
I'm a clean boy, guys.

1763
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,180
There we go.

1764
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,140
I'm so clean.

1765
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,020
Alright, now that's over.

1766
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:50,380
Yeah, that's my mandatory shower stream of the year so that my channel doesn't die.

1767
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,500
I did it.

1768
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:57,840
I saved my channel.

1769
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:00,440
I did it.

1770
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,320
Wait, maybe there's cigarettes in my parents' room.

1771
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:05,640
Alright.

1772
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,300
That's all we get.

1773
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:09,780
There's my clickbait for the year.

1774
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,720
I can see the clippers right now.

1775
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,700
Don't keep her tick shower on stream?

1776
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,640
In front of...

1777
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,340
In front of everybody?

1778
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:20,880
Oh my God.

1779
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:27,490
Wait, but where's my...

1780
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:29,410
How am I gonna get less stressed out?

1781
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:33,510
I don't understand.

1782
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:33,910
Man.

1783
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,780
Where the fuck is my...

1784
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,120
cigarettes?

1785
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,200
Oh, I don't like this.

1786
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,720
I hear like flies everywhere.

1787
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,340
Oh, does drinking release stress level?

1788
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,860
You liars.

1789
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,140
It just makes me wanna pee.

1790
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,520
At the buy smokes?

1791
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,400
It's midnight!

1792
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,600
Okay, let me...

1793
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,460
Wait, the sauna?

1794
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,560
The sauna helps too?

1795
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:12,960
Okay.

1796
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:15,900
Alright, I'm learning more and more about Finland as we play.

1797
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:17,240
Alright.

1798
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,040
Sauna time.

1799
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,720
How do I do this?

1800
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,220
Oh, oh!

1801
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:28,200
I know how to use the sauna.

1802
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:28,760
Okay.

1803
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:34,230
Okay.

1804
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:35,730
Okay, give me a sec.

1805
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,210
I gotta figure out how to fucking flip a bucket again.

1806
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:39,030
There we go.

1807
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:41,830
Alright.

1808
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:43,630
Filling up the bucket.

1809
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:47,450
Does it work if I pee in it?

1810
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:48,370
Let's try.

1811
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,110
I have some pee in me.

1812
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:52,730
Wait, did I...

1813
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:53,750
Oh my god.

1814
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:56,010
Okay, no, the water...

1815
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:58,490
Things just don't exist in Finland too, which makes sense.

1816
01:33:58,590 --> 01:33:59,210
Alright, let's see.

1817
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:03,570
No, it doesn't, guys.

1818
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,290
I can't stop.

1819
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:05,970
Oh, don't worry.

1820
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:06,510
I can stop.

1821
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:07,710
Okay.

1822
01:34:12,010 --> 01:34:13,110
No, okay, I cannot.

1823
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:14,290
Sorry, I couldn't hold it in.

1824
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:16,350
How do I...

1825
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:17,910
Go in.

1826
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:20,310
Go in.

1827
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:24,870
What the fuck?

1828
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:25,490
Go in!

1829
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:28,570
How do I miss it?

1830
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:33,070
Please, I'm gonna die of stress!

1831
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,570
I have to turn a saun... Okay, wait, wait.

1832
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:38,830
How do I turn the sauna on?

1833
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:41,570
Okay, now it's less of a make your car simulator.

1834
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:42,810
And it's like figuring out...

1835
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:43,850
Oh, there it is.

1836
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,100
Please.

1837
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:51,380
Please.

1838
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:54,880
Please.

1839
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:00,620
Okay.

1840
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,260
Does that work?

1841
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,180
Now what?

1842
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:10,230
Am I still stressed out?

1843
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:16,730
Is this it?

1844
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:18,610
I need a spoon?

1845
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:19,590
Oh, shit.

1846
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:21,030
I don't want my mom to yell at me.

1847
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:21,970
I should turn that down.

1848
01:35:22,710 --> 01:35:24,470
I don't want the wire bills to go up.

1849
01:35:25,170 --> 01:35:27,070
Where the fuck is the spoon?

1850
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:31,030
Is the spoon in the kitchen?

1851
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:34,570
It's on the bench?

1852
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:36,570
Okay.

1853
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:38,510
I can barely see.

1854
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:39,510
It's so fucking dark.

1855
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:43,270
Alright, where is my spoon?

1856
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:44,030
Oh, there it is.

1857
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:44,370
There it is.

1858
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:44,870
I see it.

1859
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:46,290
Alright.

1860
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:50,830
Okay, I'm gonna...

1861
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:51,250
Okay.

1862
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,890
Can I use a spoon?

1863
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:57,030
The first test of the day.

1864
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:59,130
Can I...

1865
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:00,610
Alright.

1866
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:05,320
Did it work?

1867
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:09,920
Did it work?

1868
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,500
Did it work?

1869
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,180
Why isn't it working?

1870
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:23,400
Oh.

1871
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,320
Oh, it's left.

1872
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:27,380
Can I get right click?

1873
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,480
Why is it not working?

1874
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,040
The temperature in the wall?

1875
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:39,400
What's the temperature?

1876
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,080
Okay, it's at 20 degrees.

1877
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:43,680
Okay, we gotta turn the temperature up.

1878
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:47,100
Is that high?

1879
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:49,240
No, that's...

1880
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:49,900
Did I turn it off?

1881
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:58,540
I don't think it's going up.

1882
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:00,860
Oh, I turned it off.

1883
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:01,120
Okay.

1884
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:02,680
I can't tell.

1885
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:04,720
Two of the knobs, they look the same.

1886
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,340
I can't tell.

1887
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:07,940
Please.

1888
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,600
I need it to go up.

1889
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:11,120
Oh, wait.

1890
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:11,680
It's a dick.

1891
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:11,980
Okay.

1892
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,140
Okay.

1893
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:21,060
Why is it still there?

1894
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:23,560
Why is my dick still at 30 degrees?

1895
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:25,680
What?

1896
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:33,240
Guys, don't you hate it when your dick is only 30 degrees?

1897
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:41,200
Don't you hate it when that happens?

1898
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,060
First world problems.

1899
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:48,120
Yeah, it's pretty annoying.

1900
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:49,720
Yeah.

1901
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:52,260
God.

1902
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,100
That's the worst, guys.

1903
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:02,920
It has to be at least 100 degrees every day.

1904
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:09,680
It's not even going up.

1905
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,580
It's just stuck at 20 degrees.

1906
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:16,460
I've never had such problems.

1907
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,120
Isn't that it?

1908
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:27,530
The stress.

1909
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:30,150
Oh my god.

1910
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:30,910
I swear.

1911
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:34,030
I'm going to die of stress before I fucking make my car.

1912
01:38:34,510 --> 01:38:35,670
It doesn't even go up.

1913
01:38:39,470 --> 01:38:40,970
Why don't you go up?

1914
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:46,040
Why you don't go up?

1915
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,580
I don't understand.

1916
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,840
I don't understand.

1917
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:54,560
I don't understand.

1918
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,840
Alright, I'm going to let it warm up for a little bit.

1919
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,080
Sometimes we have difficulty.

1920
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:03,700
It takes time, donkey.

1921
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:07,540
Where is this fly?

1922
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,440
Oh my god, this fly is actually driving me insane.

1923
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,640
I have no idea where this fly is.

1924
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:18,370
Like, does TV make me less stressed?

1925
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:22,330
Like, I'll do anything to be less stressed out.

1926
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:27,530
Oh my god, I can't even turn on the TV.

1927
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:29,070
I'm fucking stupid.

1928
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:34,250
Oh my god, I'm going to fail my car building exam.

1929
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:36,430
And then I'm going to get deported to Sweden!

1930
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:42,130
Or even worse, Denmark.

1931
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:43,830
I'm joking, please.

1932
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:44,250
I'm sorry.

1933
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:45,450
I need Denmark goons.

1934
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:46,090
I don't mean it.

1935
01:39:46,090 --> 01:39:47,470
I'm just roleplaying as a Finn.

1936
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:48,530
I'm just...

1937
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:51,750
We all know you Scandinavians hate each other.

1938
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:53,830
We all know...

1939
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:54,690
No!

1940
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:01,390
We all know you Scandinavians hate...

1941
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:02,170
You think...

1942
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:05,510
You Scandinavians think you're the better Scandinavian country.

1943
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:10,770
It's like Viking hatred now.

1944
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,220
Alright, let's see.

1945
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,820
Take her to Ikea.

1946
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:32,640
Thank you for the super chat.

1947
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,000
Thank you, thank you.

1948
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,940
Spencer, thank you for the super chat.

1949
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,200
Thank you, thank you.

1950
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:43,520
Alright.

1951
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,120
Oh my god, how do I...

1952
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:49,820
Am I...

1953
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:51,740
Why am I getting less stressed out?

1954
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:56,200
There's nothing to watch.

1955
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,340
There's nothing to watch.

1956
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:00,200
And I'm gonna die from stress.

1957
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:05,480
Oh my god.

1958
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,740
Where do I go?

1959
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:07,760
Is the sauna ready?

1960
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,780
Do you think it's ready now?

1961
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,900
Oh my god, do you think it's ready?

1962
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,720
Is my sauna ready?

1963
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:16,180
Hello?

1964
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:23,140
Oh my god, it has 40 degrees.

1965
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,160
Oh my god, it's working.

1966
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,260
Oh yeah, I forgot about the audio setting.

1967
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:28,700
I'm sorry, sound guy.

1968
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:34,320
I forgot we had to...

1969
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:39,480
It's been an hour and 43 minutes and I forgot about the audio.

1970
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:42,300
Okay.

1971
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:44,660
Alright.

1972
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:46,660
Here we go.

1973
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,620
Oh my god, I feel...

1974
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:52,520
I'm still just as stressed out.

1975
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:55,280
I don't even know if it's working.

1976
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,280
Oh my god, it's going to 40 degrees.

1977
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,440
It's coming up, guys.

1978
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:03,600
And I'm so fucking stressed out.

1979
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:07,530
Okay.

1980
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:09,170
Alright.

1981
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:11,730
Is it okay?

1982
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:13,310
Oh, I'm getting less stressed.

1983
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:14,530
I'm doing it.

1984
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:16,330
It's working.

1985
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:19,630
Let's go.

1986
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:22,730
Let's fucking go.

1987
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:22,770
Let's go.

1988
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:25,730
Okay.

1989
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:27,270
Here we go.

1990
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:30,150
Oh my god, it's so slow, though.

1991
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:31,490
It's almost daytime.

1992
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:34,430
It's actually almost daytime.

1993
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:36,930
I'm doing it.

1994
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:38,730
I'm becoming more and more finished.

1995
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:43,750
Thank you, super chat.

1996
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:44,650
Thank you, thank you.

1997
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:45,790
I can see the clickbait.

1998
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:47,950
Doki only showers once a year.

1999
01:42:48,590 --> 01:42:48,990
Okay.

2000
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:51,750
I need to be on the bench.

2001
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:53,370
How the fuck do I sit down?

2002
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,530
Oh my god, the birds are chirping.

2003
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:01,310
The sun is shining.

2004
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:05,070
And you are going to have a bad time.

2005
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:09,210
This is the viking way.

2006
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:10,490
Am I sitting down?

2007
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:12,710
I don't know if I've learned how to sit down yet.

2008
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:14,870
There's so many things I haven't learned.

2009
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:19,620
I couldn't make a trip.

2010
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:22,400
How far is the store for cigarettes?

2011
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,780
Because I don't think I can do this again.

2012
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:34,270
I'm having a bad time.

2013
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:37,170
There's going to be a...

2014
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:39,230
I can burn my house down?

2015
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:41,590
Wait, what?

2016
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:45,890
Okay, let me turn this down.

2017
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:49,790
What do you mean I can burn my house down?

2018
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:49,970
Hold on.

2019
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:56,390
Oh no, my parents are not going to like that.

2020
01:43:57,110 --> 01:43:59,850
I don't think my parents would like if I burn my house down.

2021
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:04,910
Okay, we gotta get a bike and buy some...

2022
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:05,450
Oh, you know what?

2023
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:07,430
I can just steal the sauna, honestly.

2024
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:10,570
I can't be bothered to fucking ride my bike.

2025
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:12,950
Wait, where did I put this here?

2026
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:18,150
I legitimately can't be bothered.

2027
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:18,490
Okay.

2028
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:19,630
Alright.

2029
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:19,870
Alright.

2030
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:25,410
I was trying to figure out how to piece these two together.

2031
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:27,970
Why won't it go together?

2032
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:31,010
It worked before.

2033
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:35,270
I don't understand.

2034
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:45,580
It was together before.

2035
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:50,830
Okay.

2036
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:53,270
I don't have any more bolts.

2037
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:57,090
Can I unbolt it?

2038
01:44:58,550 --> 01:45:00,110
Maybe if I unbolt it.

2039
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:01,510
I'll try the small one first.

2040
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,140
Okay, not that.

2041
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:10,340
Not that.

2042
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,380
I don't need...

2043
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:14,320
Instructions are for pussies.

2044
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:16,600
A real mechanic does it all by feel.

2045
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:26,900
If you're a real mechanic, you like close your eyes, and you go into your mind palace, and everything just comes together in your mind.

2046
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:30,800
If you can't do that, you're a fucking failure of a mechanic.

2047
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:40,740
As every mechanic will tell you, if you can't see it in mechanic vision, then you were never meant to be a mechanic.

2048
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,000
It's true.

2049
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:50,020
Please never touch a car.

2050
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:52,040
It's like the Terminator vision.

2051
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,820
But for mechanics, you know?

2052
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:58,440
You just see all the squares and the little buttons and everything.

2053
01:45:58,680 --> 01:45:59,940
You don't see that, guys.

2054
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:02,280
Oh, I guess you were never meant to be a mechanic.

2055
01:46:04,420 --> 01:46:06,820
It really sucks that that's how you find out.

2056
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,360
You're not in the right profession.

2057
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,320
You need to be born...

2058
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:20,500
It's not like a skill you can just get better at.

2059
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,160
You gotta be born with it, guys.

2060
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:25,240
If you're not born with it, you might as well quit while you're in.

2061
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:28,860
You might as well quit because you're a fucking failure.

2062
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:35,920
I can't confirm that mechanic vision is a thing.

2063
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:39,040
Thank you for the super chat.

2064
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:40,760
Thank you, thank you.

2065
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:44,240
You gotta be born with the mechanic vision.

2066
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:50,600
It's not a fucking skill, it's a talent.

2067
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:53,740
Yeah, exactly.

2068
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:59,180
Every mechanic was born in a car and will die in a car.

2069
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:05,480
If you were not born in a car, you might as well quit right now in mechanic school.

2070
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:07,980
There shouldn't even be a mechanic school.

2071
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:12,080
Mechanic school is like a scam.

2072
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:16,680
A real mechanic doesn't need to go to school to become a mechanic.

2073
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,820
Wait, there's more stuff here?

2074
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:23,600
What the fuck is this?

2075
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,480
The real mechanics are born.

2076
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:32,510
Fuel tank, car check.

2077
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:36,650
Yeah, they're not made, they're born.

2078
01:47:40,150 --> 01:47:43,530
What else does this engine need?

2079
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:44,350
I need a...

2080
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:48,300
I can't...

2081
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,640
It won't let me attach it!

2082
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:52,720
I don't understand.

2083
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:56,640
I just don't understand.

2084
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:59,380
Why can't I attach anything?

2085
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:16,570
There's no more bolts in here!

2086
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:25,650
What other bolts do I have?

2087
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:29,930
What, the entire engine?

2088
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:31,930
Where?

2089
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,980
It won't let me tighten anything.

2090
01:48:44,030 --> 01:48:44,710
Where?

2091
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:50,130
Sorry, my mechanic vision is acting up right now.

2092
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:58,770
I'm only struggling because I already used my cooldown on my mechanic vision, guys.

2093
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:02,350
Any mechanics wanna help me with their mechanic vision?

2094
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:05,330
I already used up my cooldown, chat.

2095
01:49:06,190 --> 01:49:07,590
Like, it's not my fault.

2096
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:13,030
My cooldown is just used up.

2097
01:49:16,190 --> 01:49:17,850
Guys, I'm just like you.

2098
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:20,030
I'm just like all the other mechanics out there.

2099
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:25,490
Why can't I...

2100
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:29,150
I just ulted too early!

2101
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:30,690
I'm building up my ult charge!

2102
01:49:33,090 --> 01:49:35,050
Why is none of this working?

2103
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:44,080
What am I missing?

2104
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:45,740
Oh no!

2105
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,480
No, don't fall down!

2106
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:58,550
Oil pan...

2107
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:02,900
Wait, does it go up top?

2108
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:04,240
No.

2109
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:06,820
Okay.

2110
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:12,560
No, that's not it.

2111
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:13,180
Oh!

2112
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,120
Oh!

2113
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:15,780
Oh, there we go!

2114
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:16,680
Yes!

2115
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:19,080
I knew it.

2116
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:19,740
See, guys?

2117
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:23,220
My mechanic vision worked.

2118
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:26,280
Why won't you go in?

2119
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:28,140
I don't understand.

2120
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,520
They gave me a check mark.

2121
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:31,600
Why don't you go in?

2122
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:32,740
Be friends with each other.

2123
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:33,740
Love each other!

2124
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:39,520
Oh no, everything is falling apart!

2125
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:45,240
Love each other now, please!

2126
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:50,640
Oh my god.

2127
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:55,690
Why is there so many flies?

2128
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:02,200
Is this supposed to go anywhere?

2129
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,140
I can't tell.

2130
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:09,920
Did I fuck it up?

2131
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:18,590
How do I put this inside?

2132
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:21,750
Oh no.

2133
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:26,220
Okay.

2134
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:29,680
How do I put you inside?

2135
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:37,130
It's probably like an extra piece like Lego, right?

2136
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:40,790
Probably is.

2137
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:44,190
Why won't it go inside?

2138
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:49,370
Which one is the cover?

2139
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:51,510
Is this the cover?

2140
01:51:53,510 --> 01:51:55,270
Might be like Lego, right?

2141
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:58,110
Okay.

2142
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,280
Is that the cover?

2143
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:06,500
Oh my god.

2144
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,940
Why won't you fit?

2145
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:13,160
I feel like you're supposed to be in here.

2146
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:16,000
But why won't you fit in?

2147
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:20,040
Oh!

2148
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:26,240
It goes between the piston and the shaft?

2149
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,340
So I have to take out more pieces?

2150
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:29,720
Oh, it'll be fine.

2151
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,700
We don't need it.

2152
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:33,240
It'll be fine.

2153
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,200
It's just one part.

2154
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,660
Like, it'll be fine.

2155
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:37,500
Some cars can be fine.

2156
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:42,770
Oh no, is that my mom?

2157
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:44,670
Is that my mom?

2158
01:52:45,610 --> 01:52:45,970
Hello?

2159
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:50,460
Hello, grandma!

2160
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:01,040
What would happen if I don't feed my grandma?

2161
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:01,860
Does she die?

2162
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:08,920
Does she die?

2163
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:11,340
Does grandma die if I don't give her fish?

2164
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:12,740
She'll be okay.

2165
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,700
She can eat other stuff.

2166
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:15,840
She doesn't need my help.

2167
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:19,300
Alright.

2168
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,400
She won't starve.

2169
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:23,340
Oh, I'm gonna fucking die of thirst though.

2170
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:25,820
She'll be fine, guys.

2171
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:29,480
Guys, it's not my fault my grandma dies.

2172
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,620
That means my parents don't care about her enough.

2173
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:34,640
Okay.

2174
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:37,920
I'm gonna drink my water.

2175
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:39,300
Give me a sec, guys.

2176
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:40,820
I gotta hydrate.

2177
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:42,740
Alright.

2178
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:46,300
I'm gonna eat my sausages.

2179
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,500
Oh, I'm running out of groceries.

2180
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:55,160
Guys, why is her life under my hands?

2181
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:58,400
If anything, her son should have taken care of her.

2182
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:01,800
I'm fucking trying to build a car right now!

2183
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,560
Alright, who fucking cares?

2184
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:04,320
We don't need that.

2185
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:05,020
Alright.

2186
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:07,760
We're almost done with the engine part.

2187
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:10,820
I'm pretty sure this part is not as important.

2188
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:11,940
And you know what?

2189
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,260
This is so unimportant

2190
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:18,810
that I'm just gonna put it here.

2191
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:20,690
Now it's like I never had that part.

2192
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:25,720
It's like I never had it.

2193
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:28,180
I'm joking.

2194
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:33,060
It's fine.

2195
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:39,820
You see, as if I... Guys, a camshaft is not that important, guys.

2196
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:47,080
If I know anything about cars and I am a mechanic, a camshaft is like Lego.

2197
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:49,700
You know when they give you extra pieces and it's optional?

2198
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:52,120
It's not that important.

2199
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:57,580
I gotta make sure my car fits the way that it should be.

2200
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:06,250
Yeah, there's so many other shafts inside it.

2201
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:07,910
What's one less shaft?

2202
01:55:09,790 --> 01:55:11,630
That's critical.

2203
01:55:15,230 --> 01:55:17,990
Wait, I can glitch it in?

2204
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:19,090
Okay, say less.

2205
01:55:20,110 --> 01:55:22,610
I'll brute force myself into this.

2206
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:23,610
Alright.

2207
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,340
Okay.

2208
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:33,400
I'm gonna make sure...

2209
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:34,180
Oh, wait.

2210
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:35,800
I did it!

2211
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:44,200
God, I'm so talented.

2212
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,040
I truly am the greatest mechanic of all time.

2213
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:51,060
Can your mechanic do that?

2214
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:55,640
I cannot get forced apart and will have it taken apart.

2215
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:59,860
I wish life was that easy.

2216
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:04,600
That's when you know I was truly born to be a mechanic.

2217
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:06,760
Can I put this on now?

2218
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:11,480
I'm one of the chosen ones.

2219
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,920
The prophecy was right.

2220
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:14,860
Okay.

2221
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,020
I'm the chosen one.

2222
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,400
Now what?

2223
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:19,920
Timing cover?

2224
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:24,910
What the fuck?

2225
01:56:29,610 --> 01:56:32,130
What other stuff am I missing?

2226
01:56:34,730 --> 01:56:36,070
Okay, there we go.

2227
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:37,650
We have more shafts in.

2228
01:56:40,690 --> 01:56:41,210
Okay.

2229
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:49,310
Okay, that's way too easy, Doki.

2230
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:50,930
Come on, you're better than this.

2231
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:55,450
Your channel is much more highbrow than this.

2232
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:59,490
I know you wanna say it, Doki, but come on.

2233
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:01,490
You can do better.

2234
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:06,410
Okay.

2235
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:07,170
Okay.

2236
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:08,610
I saw a checkmark for this.

2237
01:57:08,710 --> 01:57:10,030
I don't know what this is.

2238
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:12,070
No, it's not.

2239
01:57:13,810 --> 01:57:14,470
There we go.

2240
01:57:14,510 --> 01:57:16,570
I have no idea what I... Oh, there we go.

2241
01:57:16,810 --> 01:57:17,610
It works.

2242
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:20,290
That's all I have to wait until I see a checkmark.

2243
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:22,310
I'm just gonna ram it in.

2244
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:25,010
Okay.

2245
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:26,190
Wiring mess.

2246
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:28,870
Headers.

2247
01:57:30,050 --> 01:57:30,770
Radiator.

2248
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:34,490
I'm still at the fucking engine.

2249
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:36,870
When will this...

2250
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:39,250
Oh my god.

2251
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:46,000
Okay, brake master cylinder.

2252
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:48,000
Clearly, that should be something, right?

2253
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:54,200
Just like your local doctor.

2254
01:57:57,210 --> 01:57:58,790
Force it until it works.

2255
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:01,350
Okay.

2256
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:04,150
What other stuff will it need?

2257
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:08,510
Is this all right?

2258
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:09,790
Is this everything?

2259
01:58:10,570 --> 01:58:14,050
Oh, I feel like I should start screwing things in though.

2260
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:18,250
Right?

2261
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:19,770
Is it tied?

2262
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:26,670
I don't see any screws.

2263
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:32,110
Like, how am I supposed to know which fucking wrench it is for which screw?

2264
01:58:33,070 --> 01:58:34,650
Like, it doesn't even...

2265
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:36,830
The sizes aren't even that accurate!

2266
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,060
Okay.

2267
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:48,260
Is that it?

2268
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:49,020
No.

2269
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:52,000
You don't...

2270
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,260
Like, it doesn't even...

2271
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:55,020
When it's in my hand, why does it...

2272
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:56,680
Okay, wait, do I start screwing this?

2273
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:58,060
I don't know if I start screwing this.

2274
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:00,420
This one goes here.

2275
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:03,040
At least we know this one goes here.

2276
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:08,470
Where does the water pump go in here?

2277
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:16,150
Where do you go?

2278
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:22,890
It doesn't give me a check mark.

2279
01:59:25,290 --> 01:59:28,010
Everything came to me in a dream.

2280
01:59:29,290 --> 01:59:29,850
No!

2281
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:34,390
No, this...

2282
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:36,610
No, you guys were meant to be!

2283
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:38,770
What happened?!

2284
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:40,690
There we go.

2285
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:47,030
What the fuck do I do now?

2286
01:59:51,770 --> 01:59:53,370
Wait, why can't I pick you up?

2287
01:59:55,810 --> 01:59:56,970
Oh my god.

2288
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:58,590
I'm gonna freak out.

2289
01:59:58,590 --> 02:00:00,630
I'm gonna fucking...

2290
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:03,950
I can't even pick it up anymore!

2291
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:09,290
It won't let me pick...

2292
02:00:09,290 --> 02:00:11,950
Oh my god, who's calling me now?!

2293
02:00:15,290 --> 02:00:16,430
Who is it?

2294
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:20,070
Oh my god.

2295
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:22,650
It's just telemarketers, guys.

2296
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:23,410
It doesn't matter.

2297
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:26,210
It's just telemarketers, guys.

2298
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:28,590
Oh my god.

2299
02:00:28,650 --> 02:00:31,170
Why can't I pick up my engine?

2300
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:33,830
It won't even let...

2301
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:34,470
Oh, there it is.

2302
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:41,190
Why am I still at this part?!

2303
02:00:41,190 --> 02:00:42,750
I'm gonna bolt this down for now.

2304
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:47,030
And then...

2305
02:00:47,030 --> 02:00:48,610
Okay, that's bolted down.

2306
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:51,590
Like...

2307
02:00:52,590 --> 02:00:53,230
Where...

2308
02:00:53,230 --> 02:00:56,150
Oh my god, where are things supposed to go?

2309
02:00:56,650 --> 02:00:59,910
Yes, I'm still building the fucking engine?!

2310
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,700
A genius takes time in their work of art.

2311
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:18,180
You don't tell DaVinci that you have a one hour deadline to make the Mona Lisa.

2312
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:22,460
This is my Mona Lisa right now.

2313
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:28,710
An hour spent on me.

2314
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:31,090
An hour spent on me.

2315
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:32,210
This is my Mona Lisa!

2316
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:39,270
I'm literally painting the Great Cathedral... The mural of the Great Cathedral right now.

2317
02:01:39,450 --> 02:01:46,510
Did you know the mural in the Great Cathedral of Notre Dame took like 20 to 30 years to paint?

2318
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:48,150
That's right!

2319
02:01:48,490 --> 02:01:50,610
And you're trying to rush the process?

2320
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:55,130
You're trying to rush God's gift to the world?

2321
02:01:56,670 --> 02:01:58,510
Weird witnessing art.

2322
02:01:58,650 --> 02:01:59,090
Alright.

2323
02:01:59,090 --> 02:01:59,950
Alright.

2324
02:02:03,210 --> 02:02:03,810
Okay.

2325
02:02:09,730 --> 02:02:11,850
Duck, thank you for the super chat thing.

2326
02:02:12,150 --> 02:02:12,910
Thank you.

2327
02:02:13,330 --> 02:02:16,630
Here we see a streamer in their most hostile environment.

2328
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:25,130
A blue-collared job, which is, as the most mechanically illiterate person you've ever seen, trying to cast like Chaplin.

2329
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:28,210
And to believe it, they can put together a car.

2330
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:29,110
WOOOOOO!

2331
02:02:29,110 --> 02:02:29,850
WOOOOOO!

2332
02:02:30,730 --> 02:02:31,410
Okay.

2333
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:35,010
Thank God there's no fall damage.

2334
02:02:35,170 --> 02:02:39,230
I would've been so sad if that is how I was gonna go.

2335
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:41,010
Holy fuck.

2336
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:42,270
Thank God.

2337
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:46,030
I glitched into the car.

2338
02:02:46,130 --> 02:02:47,790
The car threw me off.

2339
02:02:48,150 --> 02:02:50,550
The car rejected my existence.

2340
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:52,950
They're like...

2341
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:54,490
Oh my God.

2342
02:02:54,610 --> 02:02:55,630
What the fuck?

2343
02:02:55,970 --> 02:02:56,310
Sorry.

2344
02:02:56,490 --> 02:02:59,170
The car like rejected my existence there.

2345
02:02:59,690 --> 02:03:02,070
But other than that, everything's fine.

2346
02:03:02,410 --> 02:03:04,990
Everything is so fucking fine.

2347
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:08,630
Just finish things, you know?

2348
02:03:09,970 --> 02:03:11,110
You don't pick the car.

2349
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:12,510
The car picks you.

2350
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:17,630
You can't rush that guy from Toy Story 2.

2351
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:19,310
Thank you for the super chat Neppers.

2352
02:03:19,610 --> 02:03:19,750
Thank you.

2353
02:03:19,950 --> 02:03:23,150
What am I missing?!

2354
02:03:24,930 --> 02:03:27,530
Why does car- Why do cars have so many parts?

2355
02:03:27,630 --> 02:03:28,670
I don't understand.

2356
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:30,630
It should be like DUPLO.

2357
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:38,830
Cars should just be like DUPLO where everything is just like three parts.

2358
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:54,930
Where do I fit this?

2359
02:03:57,310 --> 02:04:00,230
Apparently I'm supposed to fit some oil- Oh, the oil filter.

2360
02:04:04,870 --> 02:04:07,370
Like, where would the oil filter go?

2361
02:04:15,050 --> 02:04:17,210
The clutch is not part of the oil filter.

2362
02:04:17,210 --> 02:04:17,850
The engine?

2363
02:04:18,590 --> 02:04:21,110
But everything is part of the engine.

2364
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:23,710
It's all engine.

2365
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:27,430
That's what the engine is.

2366
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:28,850
The engine is the car.

2367
02:04:29,650 --> 02:04:31,830
How can it not be part of the engine?

2368
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:40,160
Oh my god.

2369
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,700
Do I add a chain to it?

2370
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:47,780
Does it want a metal chain?

2371
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:52,520
It does.

2372
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:53,820
He feels a little gangster.

2373
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:57,720
Giving him a silver chain to make him feel good.

2374
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:05,480
There's no more gears.

2375
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,640
What kind of gears am I missing?

2376
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:11,800
I put every gear possible into this fucking car.

2377
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:13,940
The drive gear?

2378
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:24,450
Oh my god.

2379
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:36,140
What other gear does it need?

2380
02:05:37,940 --> 02:05:38,560
A cover?

2381
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:39,800
There's another cover?

2382
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,280
Oh, there is.

2383
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:46,580
My TV?

2384
02:05:49,160 --> 02:05:50,380
Oh, there it is.

2385
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:52,540
Oh my god.

2386
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:54,960
I forgot to turn off my TV.

2387
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:01,520
How do I still have zero channels?

2388
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:04,240
Do I need to pay for cable?

2389
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:08,280
Alright.

2390
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:09,600
Alright.

2391
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:14,280
So now that we got the cover on this...

2392
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:16,680
Can I add more stuff to it now?

2393
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:22,600
Oh my god.

2394
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,140
What other things can I add?

2395
02:06:32,090 --> 02:06:33,810
Do the fins not have...

2396
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:35,470
Do the fins need to pay for cable?

2397
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:39,950
Also, I don't know if the sound has been...

2398
02:06:40,570 --> 02:06:41,730
I'm sorry, sound guy.

2399
02:06:42,490 --> 02:06:45,830
But do I need to turn anything up?

2400
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:50,070
Or have you guys just been hearing me scream with zero sound?

2401
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:51,710
What the fuck did I...

2402
02:06:51,710 --> 02:06:53,170
Okay, if it works, it works.

2403
02:06:53,290 --> 02:06:55,010
I don't know how that worked, but it worked.

2404
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:02,670
It still doesn't fit.

2405
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:03,890
It still won't fit.

2406
02:07:04,090 --> 02:07:05,110
I don't understand.

2407
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:07,970
Why do you reject him?

2408
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:12,550
I don't understand why you reject him.

2409
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:16,750
Come on.

2410
02:07:16,750 --> 02:07:18,130
He's like a part of you.

2411
02:07:24,730 --> 02:07:25,710
Okay, nope.

2412
02:07:27,070 --> 02:07:29,250
I will force you to love each other.

2413
02:07:30,430 --> 02:07:32,190
If it's the last thing I do.

2414
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:35,920
Come on.

2415
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:37,580
Come on.

2416
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:40,540
Come on, love each other.

2417
02:07:44,410 --> 02:07:45,590
Come on.

2418
02:07:48,690 --> 02:07:49,930
Come on.

2419
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:52,690
Come on.

2420
02:07:52,690 --> 02:07:56,850
If I can glitch a stick into you, I can glitch this into you.

2421
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:58,850
There we go.

2422
02:08:00,230 --> 02:08:01,430
Okay, that's definitely not in.

2423
02:08:05,490 --> 02:08:06,330
Oh my god.

2424
02:08:06,410 --> 02:08:09,950
This one is like the one gear that wouldn't fit in.

2425
02:08:10,050 --> 02:08:12,190
It actually is rejecting the full engine.

2426
02:08:12,710 --> 02:08:13,870
I don't understand.

2427
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,810
I don't understand why you reject each other.

2428
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:22,600
Like, I can't figure it out.

2429
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:27,340
It just doesn't fit.

2430
02:08:30,990 --> 02:08:33,410
Do I have to unbolt it?

2431
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:39,850
I don't have anything that works with this.

2432
02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:49,750
Oh my god.

2433
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:52,270
Oh my god.

2434
02:08:52,330 --> 02:08:53,270
I found the wrench.

2435
02:08:54,530 --> 02:08:55,970
I fucking did it.

2436
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:01,180
It's like making her...

2437
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:02,800
Piss, damn you!

2438
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,040
Piss!

2439
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:05,580
Okay.

2440
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:07,400
Alright, we did it.

2441
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,220
We fucking figured it out.

2442
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:11,980
I fucking did it.

2443
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:13,460
Alright.

2444
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:17,540
And now you guys should be able to kiss now.

2445
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:19,380
Now kiss.

2446
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:21,760
Oh my god, I fucking did it.

2447
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:22,820
I made them kiss.

2448
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:25,000
Alright.

2449
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,880
There we go.

2450
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,480
Oh my god.

2451
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:31,200
I'm fucking doing it.

2452
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:31,680
Okay.

2453
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:33,780
Finally.

2454
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:37,340
Now I need to bolt the other stuff down.

2455
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:40,420
Okay, bolt this.

2456
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:44,200
Unbolt that.

2457
02:09:47,790 --> 02:09:48,490
That's right.

2458
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:49,870
Get your camcorders out.

2459
02:09:49,950 --> 02:09:50,910
We did it, boys.

2460
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:54,790
Now they'll be happy together forever.

2461
02:09:57,750 --> 02:09:58,230
Alright.

2462
02:09:58,510 --> 02:09:59,830
Then we bolt this down.

2463
02:10:01,790 --> 02:10:02,870
And this down.

2464
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:06,730
Oh my god, there's so many bolts.

2465
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:10,310
Like, I feel like I can just bolt half of it and it'll be fine.

2466
02:10:10,490 --> 02:10:12,530
Like, it's not gonna come apart or anything.

2467
02:10:12,750 --> 02:10:13,710
Cause like...

2468
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:19,550
Like I said, if I just stuffed the entire hood of the car with things, it can't fall apart.

2469
02:10:19,970 --> 02:10:22,350
Because everything's pushing each other together, right?

2470
02:10:23,730 --> 02:10:28,790
It's like, Oh, if I forget to screw one little thing, my car fucking explodes.

2471
02:10:28,930 --> 02:10:30,170
That can't be right.

2472
02:10:31,190 --> 02:10:33,030
My fellow mechanics will vouch for me.

2473
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:36,150
That's why all your cars is only partially screwed down.

2474
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:40,670
Alright.

2475
02:10:42,930 --> 02:10:44,130
Is it over?

2476
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:46,150
Is the engine done?

2477
02:10:46,330 --> 02:10:46,950
Did I do it?

2478
02:10:49,230 --> 02:10:51,710
There's no way there's more stuff to this engine.

2479
02:10:53,830 --> 02:10:55,170
There's no way.

2480
02:10:56,730 --> 02:10:57,830
Is that it?

2481
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:03,160
Why is it stuck?

2482
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:04,320
Oh, guys.

2483
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:09,080
Guys, I think my water pump is stuck, guys.

2484
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:09,900
Guys.

2485
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:13,440
I'm a bit worried.

2486
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:18,480
I'm a bit worried cause I cannot pick up the water pump.

2487
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:25,610
Don't worry, if I bolt it down, maybe...

2488
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:29,560
I'm not so close.

2489
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:31,560
Oh, there you go.

2490
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:34,260
Where do I put this?

2491
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:45,170
Where the fuck does this part go?

2492
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:51,740
What am I missing from this car?

2493
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:56,260
Alright, where's the manual?

2494
02:11:57,300 --> 02:12:03,080
Guys, I know what I'm doing, but I wanna show you guys what I'm doing.

2495
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:04,380
You know, with the manual.

2496
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:10,360
I wanna show you guys my thought process to show you guys that everything is going okay.

2497
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:23,820
Guys, I know exactly what I'm doing, but I think you guys don't know what I'm doing, so I'm trying to make sure you know exactly what's going on.

2498
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:28,340
Where's the manual, guys?

2499
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:34,880
There is no...

2500
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:35,300
Okay.

2501
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:36,840
See, guys?

2502
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:38,400
That was a test, everybody.

2503
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:39,760
Cause, like...

2504
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:42,460
If you're like, yeah, oh my god!

2505
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:44,160
Then you're not a real mechanic.

2506
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:45,260
Quit your day job.

2507
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:47,920
Alright.

2508
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:50,700
Actually, don't quit your day job.

2509
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:52,760
It was a test, guys.

2510
02:12:53,780 --> 02:12:55,720
I wanna know who the fucking quitters are.

2511
02:12:55,820 --> 02:12:58,800
Who are fake mechanics in my chat?

2512
02:13:02,610 --> 02:13:04,790
Guys, I don't know if I'm strong enough.

2513
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:06,430
Guys...

2514
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:10,870
I don't know if I'm strong enough.

2515
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:12,910
I need to go...

2516
02:13:12,910 --> 02:13:15,670
I need... I'm gonna go buy cigarettes.

2517
02:13:15,930 --> 02:13:17,410
I fucking can't.

2518
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:19,310
I can't.

2519
02:13:19,330 --> 02:13:20,430
How do I...

2520
02:13:21,190 --> 02:13:22,550
I can't.

2521
02:13:23,430 --> 02:13:26,510
The fuck do I even...

2522
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:28,950
How do I get on my own bike?

2523
02:13:32,290 --> 02:13:36,650
I can't even sit on my...

2524
02:13:36,650 --> 02:13:37,550
Oh, no.

2525
02:13:39,110 --> 02:13:41,370
I'm clicking everything!

2526
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:46,310
I can't even sit on my bike!

2527
02:13:47,830 --> 02:13:49,450
I need them.

2528
02:13:50,210 --> 02:13:51,030
Ow!

2529
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:56,050
Does it enter?

2530
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:59,270
Guess not enter.

2531
02:14:02,990 --> 02:14:03,650
Okay, fuck.

2532
02:14:07,010 --> 02:14:08,310
How do I do it?

2533
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:10,710
Am I on it?

2534
02:14:14,510 --> 02:14:15,110
Am I on it?

2535
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:18,030
Okay.

2536
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:24,940
Vroom!

2537
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:28,560
Hey, wait.

2538
02:14:34,230 --> 02:14:35,350
Please.

2539
02:14:35,870 --> 02:14:37,270
Please, for the love of God.

2540
02:14:38,110 --> 02:14:38,510
Please!

2541
02:14:40,370 --> 02:14:41,210
Vroom!

2542
02:14:41,210 --> 02:14:46,590
Oh, my God.

2543
02:14:46,690 --> 02:14:51,490
I'm gonna fucking crash right now.

2544
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:54,910
Driving controls.

2545
02:14:55,390 --> 02:14:56,810
Vehicle controls.

2546
02:14:57,370 --> 02:14:58,090
Space.

2547
02:14:58,270 --> 02:14:58,930
Shift.

2548
02:14:59,230 --> 02:15:00,170
Lights.

2549
02:15:00,990 --> 02:15:01,630
Auto.

2550
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:02,450
Boost.

2551
02:15:02,590 --> 02:15:04,050
Oh, my God.

2552
02:15:05,810 --> 02:15:07,090
Vroom!

2553
02:15:07,090 --> 02:15:07,410
Vroom!

2554
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:13,060
Is that it?

2555
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:17,840
Is it on?

2556
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,780
Oh, it's full.

2557
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:28,020
The fuel is full.

2558
02:15:37,190 --> 02:15:38,110
Vroom!

2559
02:15:44,170 --> 02:15:45,610
I don't understand.

2560
02:15:47,910 --> 02:15:49,530
I don't understand.

2561
02:15:51,530 --> 02:15:54,310
How do I kick start it?

2562
02:15:58,330 --> 02:15:59,790
It's just...

2563
02:15:59,790 --> 02:16:02,330
I'm trying my best to rev it!

2564
02:16:02,890 --> 02:16:03,390
Vroom!

2565
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:12,310
Oh, my God.

2566
02:16:12,770 --> 02:16:14,550
Oh, my God.

2567
02:16:14,650 --> 02:16:15,990
I don't understand.

2568
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:20,430
Why won't you vroom?

2569
02:16:22,670 --> 02:16:24,930
What am I missing?

2570
02:16:27,230 --> 02:16:28,050
Okay.

2571
02:16:28,050 --> 02:16:30,030
Throttle.

2572
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:30,930
W.

2573
02:16:31,190 --> 02:16:31,970
Throttle.

2574
02:16:34,050 --> 02:16:34,630
Key?

2575
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:37,530
There's no keys on this bike!

2576
02:16:41,780 --> 02:16:42,800
Like...

2577
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:43,900
Oh, my God.

2578
02:16:48,410 --> 02:16:48,960
Vroom?

2579
02:16:57,590 --> 02:16:58,690
Vroom?

2580
02:17:09,310 --> 02:17:10,890
How much more?

2581
02:17:13,210 --> 02:17:15,270
Oh, my God.

2582
02:17:15,270 --> 02:17:15,350
Okay.

2583
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:16,830
Vroom!

2584
02:17:17,770 --> 02:17:18,270
Vroom!

2585
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:30,860
What am I missing?

2586
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:33,000
What am I...

2587
02:17:35,720 --> 02:17:37,060
What am I missing?

2588
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:40,780
How do I put this fucker in here?

2589
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,800
No, get out of the kick start!

2590
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:47,660
Oh, my God!

2591
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:47,940
Okay.

2592
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:49,460
Shift.

2593
02:17:53,210 --> 02:17:54,070
Oh, my God.

2594
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:55,330
I have to...

2595
02:17:55,330 --> 02:17:58,290
I have to do this again.

2596
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:07,810
Oh, my God!

2597
02:18:07,950 --> 02:18:08,250
Vroom!

2598
02:18:09,670 --> 02:18:10,430
Oh, my God!

2599
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:11,230
Okay, where do I go?

2600
02:18:12,310 --> 02:18:13,290
Where do I go?

2601
02:18:13,850 --> 02:18:15,830
I assume this is where the store is.

2602
02:18:16,330 --> 02:18:16,850
Oh, my God.

2603
02:18:16,850 --> 02:18:17,750
We're vrooming.

2604
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:19,710
Oh, I'm so thirsty.

2605
02:18:20,190 --> 02:18:22,170
Oh, am I going the right way?

2606
02:18:22,790 --> 02:18:26,070
I don't know if I'm going the right way!

2607
02:18:27,150 --> 02:18:28,610
I'm just gonna follow the road.

2608
02:18:29,730 --> 02:18:31,850
Wait, it's the wrong way?

2609
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:37,250
All of the trees... Okay, it's the other way.

2610
02:18:37,330 --> 02:18:37,530
Okay.

2611
02:18:37,970 --> 02:18:39,670
Okay, I'm really thirsty, guys.

2612
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:40,790
This is really bad.

2613
02:18:41,210 --> 02:18:43,530
This is actually really bad.

2614
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:44,870
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2615
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:49,170
Now that I know how to... Now that I know how to drive...

2616
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:50,850
Now that I know... Okay.

2617
02:18:51,730 --> 02:18:52,190
Alright.

2618
02:18:54,570 --> 02:18:55,570
I need to get off.

2619
02:18:56,070 --> 02:18:56,830
How do I get off?

2620
02:18:58,630 --> 02:18:59,410
How do I...

2621
02:18:59,410 --> 02:19:00,130
I need to get off.

2622
02:19:00,590 --> 02:19:00,930
Okay.

2623
02:19:01,810 --> 02:19:03,090
Okay, I figured it out.

2624
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:04,710
Okay, let me go get a drink first.

2625
02:19:05,310 --> 02:19:08,050
I need to go get a drink before I fucking crash out.

2626
02:19:09,510 --> 02:19:12,170
Alright, let me turn on this.

2627
02:19:14,290 --> 02:19:15,210
And then...

2628
02:19:15,210 --> 02:19:16,510
Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp.

2629
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:19,190
Alright.

2630
02:19:19,830 --> 02:19:22,410
And then we'll buy some cigarettes now.

2631
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:24,790
Alright, we'll figure out how to vroom.

2632
02:19:26,650 --> 02:19:27,170
Alright.

2633
02:19:33,850 --> 02:19:34,830
Oh, I can!

2634
02:19:35,630 --> 02:19:38,310
Okay, let me start lowering the stress a little bit.

2635
02:19:38,830 --> 02:19:39,890
Alright, it's vroom time.

2636
02:19:40,450 --> 02:19:43,170
I told you, if you say vroom loud enough, it works.

2637
02:19:44,570 --> 02:19:45,910
God, this is...

2638
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:46,350
Okay.

2639
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:48,570
Stand off.

2640
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:51,170
There we go.

2641
02:19:53,570 --> 02:19:53,970
Vroom.

2642
02:19:54,670 --> 02:19:55,390
There we go.

2643
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:57,190
Vroom!

2644
02:19:58,990 --> 02:20:00,710
Alright, am I going the right way?

2645
02:20:01,130 --> 02:20:03,250
Am I going to the store now, guys?

2646
02:20:03,490 --> 02:20:04,450
Am I heading...

2647
02:20:05,070 --> 02:20:07,830
Alright, left, door, right.

2648
02:20:07,890 --> 02:20:08,630
Is this the store?

2649
02:20:09,190 --> 02:20:10,570
That has to be the store, right?

2650
02:20:13,510 --> 02:20:14,170
Alright.

2651
02:20:14,170 --> 02:20:14,750
I'm zooming.

2652
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:15,830
Who lives there?

2653
02:20:16,650 --> 02:20:17,510
Is this the store?

2654
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:20,110
Oh no, it was left.

2655
02:20:20,650 --> 02:20:21,150
That's alright.

2656
02:20:21,670 --> 02:20:23,010
Slow and steady.

2657
02:20:23,970 --> 02:20:24,550
That's alright.

2658
02:20:24,690 --> 02:20:26,350
We make our own roads.

2659
02:20:27,130 --> 02:20:27,570
Guys.

2660
02:20:28,750 --> 02:20:31,270
I'm far from the store?

2661
02:20:31,850 --> 02:20:32,370
It's fine.

2662
02:20:33,330 --> 02:20:35,130
It's fine, we make our own roads.

2663
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:37,870
There we go.

2664
02:20:40,570 --> 02:20:44,130
The store is 20 miles away?

2665
02:20:44,430 --> 02:20:47,670
How am I supposed to know where the store is?

2666
02:20:50,570 --> 02:20:52,290
Alright, vroom.

2667
02:20:53,670 --> 02:20:56,110
I just wanted cigarettes.

2668
02:20:58,410 --> 02:21:01,130
It can't be that long, guys.

2669
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:03,210
Shift up?

2670
02:21:05,170 --> 02:21:06,850
I don't know what shift up does.

2671
02:21:10,890 --> 02:21:13,390
Why do I live in the middle of nowhere?

2672
02:21:13,710 --> 02:21:15,250
Where are my parents?

2673
02:21:15,390 --> 02:21:16,850
It's been two days.

2674
02:21:17,890 --> 02:21:18,570
I think...

2675
02:21:18,570 --> 02:21:21,170
There's no way my grandma dies.

2676
02:21:21,350 --> 02:21:21,910
There's no way.

2677
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:27,410
If she's really starving, she'll order Uber Eats.

2678
02:21:28,390 --> 02:21:29,490
In the rural area.

2679
02:21:31,150 --> 02:21:32,410
Am I faster now?

2680
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:35,910
Can't tell.

2681
02:21:38,890 --> 02:21:40,590
I can't tell if I'm going faster.

2682
02:21:43,050 --> 02:21:44,390
Am I going faster?

2683
02:21:55,950 --> 02:21:58,730
Guys, I just realized I did not wear my helmet, guys.

2684
02:21:58,910 --> 02:22:00,130
Oh, this is bad.

2685
02:22:00,190 --> 02:22:02,570
I'm sorry for anybody who's getting motion sickness right now.

2686
02:22:03,630 --> 02:22:04,990
I'm so sorry.

2687
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:06,950
Oh, guys.

2688
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:10,550
Guys, I realized I did not wear my helmet, guys.

2689
02:22:10,610 --> 02:22:11,330
I'm so sorry.

2690
02:22:11,330 --> 02:22:11,990
Oh, no.

2691
02:22:12,090 --> 02:22:13,170
I'm so sorry.

2692
02:22:14,870 --> 02:22:16,270
I'm so sorry.

2693
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:18,130
I'm getting motion sickness.

2694
02:22:18,630 --> 02:22:20,470
Oh, this ain't looking so good.

2695
02:22:20,530 --> 02:22:21,650
Oh, my God!

2696
02:22:22,030 --> 02:22:25,110
If you pause the game, you don't pause the game!

2697
02:22:27,550 --> 02:22:28,650
It'll be fine.

2698
02:22:33,310 --> 02:22:34,030
It's okay.

2699
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:35,070
Things will be fine.

2700
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:35,590
See?

2701
02:22:37,070 --> 02:22:37,950
Look at that.

2702
02:22:38,590 --> 02:22:42,290
I think I can look at my menu while I'm riding my...

2703
02:22:42,290 --> 02:22:42,990
I cannot look at my menu.

2704
02:22:43,130 --> 02:22:44,110
I cannot look at my menu.

2705
02:22:44,210 --> 02:22:45,370
I cannot look... Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2706
02:22:45,470 --> 02:22:45,890
Before...

2707
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:46,490
Which way?

2708
02:22:48,270 --> 02:22:48,990
Which way?

2709
02:22:50,770 --> 02:22:51,650
Is it...

2710
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:54,310
Rakipohaja or Lope?

2711
02:22:55,930 --> 02:22:57,090
Where could it be?

2712
02:22:58,950 --> 02:23:00,630
There's another bike next to me.

2713
02:23:02,070 --> 02:23:03,310
I hear another bike.

2714
02:23:03,730 --> 02:23:04,510
Is it the right side?

2715
02:23:05,370 --> 02:23:05,810
Oh, no.

2716
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:07,590
Oh, no.

2717
02:23:07,690 --> 02:23:10,030
I gotta...

2718
02:23:10,030 --> 02:23:11,290
Alright, there we go.

2719
02:23:12,530 --> 02:23:13,810
Oh, no.

2720
02:23:13,890 --> 02:23:14,930
It's still...

2721
02:23:16,390 --> 02:23:16,910
Okay.

2722
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:18,470
There we go.

2723
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:21,150
I heard another bike next to me.

2724
02:23:21,550 --> 02:23:22,090
Oh, my God!

2725
02:23:22,190 --> 02:23:22,750
Bike friend!

2726
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:31,200
Is there a bike friend?

2727
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:37,790
Wait, it's the other side?

2728
02:23:41,150 --> 02:23:42,450
Which way is this?

2729
02:23:42,450 --> 02:23:43,330
Is it...

2730
02:23:43,330 --> 02:23:44,290
Some people...

2731
02:23:44,290 --> 02:23:46,930
Okay, I'm fine.

2732
02:23:47,010 --> 02:23:47,530
I'm okay.

2733
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:52,980
No.

2734
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:55,900
I can't do this.

2735
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:57,200
Why?

2736
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:00,600
I...

2737
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:01,140
Please!

2738
02:24:13,250 --> 02:24:14,230
Oh, I give up.

2739
02:24:14,270 --> 02:24:15,070
I'm going back home.

2740
02:24:16,030 --> 02:24:16,810
I'm...

2741
02:24:17,420 --> 02:24:18,790
I'm going home.

2742
02:24:18,810 --> 02:24:19,810
I gotta...

2743
02:24:19,810 --> 02:24:22,350
I'm going back home.

2744
02:24:22,450 --> 02:24:23,170
I can't...

2745
02:24:23,170 --> 02:24:24,210
Am I even close?

2746
02:24:24,730 --> 02:24:27,650
I can't...

2747
02:24:27,650 --> 02:24:29,630
I can't...

2748
02:24:29,630 --> 02:24:30,810
I can't...

2749
02:24:30,810 --> 02:24:32,150
I'm walking back home.

2750
02:24:38,770 --> 02:24:41,230
I'm stressed.

2751
02:24:42,530 --> 02:24:43,330
I can't.

2752
02:24:43,710 --> 02:24:45,350
I can't.

2753
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:51,490
I can't.

2754
02:24:51,490 --> 02:24:53,770
I can't do this anymore.

2755
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:56,490
I'm going home.

2756
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:59,990
I'm going home.

2757
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:03,470
I can't do this.

2758
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:04,730
Please!

2759
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:09,370
I'm so stressed out.

2760
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:18,730
I can't.

2761
02:25:18,730 --> 02:25:20,430
I'm sorry.

2762
02:25:26,250 --> 02:25:28,390
I'm so stressed.

2763
02:25:32,390 --> 02:25:34,890
Oh my god.

2764
02:25:39,150 --> 02:25:41,330
Lord, thank you for the super chat.

2765
02:25:41,630 --> 02:25:41,990
Thank you.

2766
02:25:42,510 --> 02:25:43,090
Thank you.

2767
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:45,930
Okay.

2768
02:25:46,230 --> 02:25:47,110
Give me a sec.

2769
02:25:47,150 --> 02:25:48,540
He needs to be fed.

2770
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:50,100
He's hungry.

2771
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:55,320
He's like, if you're gonna cry, at least feed me first.

2772
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:56,560
I'm sorry.

2773
02:26:20,070 --> 02:26:22,010
He's so smart.

2774
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:26,910
He's like, she's having a breakdown.

2775
02:26:27,830 --> 02:26:31,410
It's my time to strike now.

2776
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:33,990
She's weak.

2777
02:26:34,770 --> 02:26:36,290
And he knows it.

2778
02:26:36,530 --> 02:26:39,670
He knows that I am weak.

2779
02:26:40,730 --> 02:26:42,530
Oh my god.

2780
02:26:42,670 --> 02:26:44,150
He sensed the weakness.

2781
02:26:45,470 --> 02:26:47,710
He was like, that's it.

2782
02:26:48,570 --> 02:26:51,230
Now she now she'll do anything.

2783
02:26:51,770 --> 02:26:53,570
Wait, did I went the wrong way?

2784
02:26:53,650 --> 02:26:54,670
Is this back where I came from?

2785
02:26:55,890 --> 02:26:57,370
This is where home is.

2786
02:26:57,990 --> 02:26:59,670
This is where home is.

2787
02:26:59,790 --> 02:27:01,710
I'm so tired and I'm dirty.

2788
02:27:01,830 --> 02:27:04,670
And my car still haven't finished the engine.

2789
02:27:04,670 --> 02:27:12,290
I I haven't I haven't even finished the engine.

2790
02:27:12,970 --> 02:27:15,790
I'm not picking up my bike.

2791
02:27:15,870 --> 02:27:17,650
I don't care anymore.

2792
02:27:19,130 --> 02:27:21,490
I don't care anymore.

2793
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:23,510
I just wanna go home.

2794
02:27:23,990 --> 02:27:28,130
I just wanna go home.

2795
02:27:34,670 --> 02:27:36,430
I don't need the bike.

2796
02:27:36,570 --> 02:27:37,390
I'm tired.

2797
02:27:37,610 --> 02:27:40,930
The bike is falling.

2798
02:27:44,510 --> 02:27:45,870
I'm stressed.

2799
02:27:46,130 --> 02:27:47,210
I'm tired.

2800
02:27:47,570 --> 02:27:48,950
I'm dirty.

2801
02:27:50,010 --> 02:27:56,970
I just wanna finish the engine.

2802
02:28:12,230 --> 02:28:12,270
I

2803
02:28:16,750 --> 02:28:16,830
I I I

2804
02:28:26,630 --> 02:28:29,610
I I I I I I I I I I'm malnourished as hell too.

2805
02:28:31,550 --> 02:28:33,910
I'm like so malnourished right now.

2806
02:28:33,970 --> 02:28:34,770
I'm dirty.

2807
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:37,410
I need food.

2808
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:42,610
Hello sir, can you help me?

2809
02:28:43,230 --> 02:28:46,210
I need to find my way home.

2810
02:28:46,650 --> 02:28:48,370
Can you help me sir?

2811
02:28:48,490 --> 02:28:51,150
Okay, he doesn't give a fuck about me.

2812
02:28:51,350 --> 02:28:54,170
I don't even know how to interact with him.

2813
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:57,030
Oh my...

2814
02:28:57,030 --> 02:28:58,310
Water, thank you for the super chat.

2815
02:28:58,390 --> 02:28:59,390
Thank you, thank you.

2816
02:28:59,630 --> 02:29:01,230
Fell asleep to the stream.

2817
02:29:01,330 --> 02:29:02,530
It was the most hilarious stream.

2818
02:29:02,650 --> 02:29:04,090
Just Doki screaming and laughing.

2819
02:29:04,290 --> 02:29:05,350
Made my stream so hysterical.

2820
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:06,670
Love you Doki.

2821
02:29:06,870 --> 02:29:08,750
Thank you for the super chat.

2822
02:29:08,850 --> 02:29:10,650
Water, thank you, thank you.

2823
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:13,830
Where is everybody?

2824
02:29:14,330 --> 02:29:15,990
Do I not have neighbors?

2825
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:20,010
Please, I just want a car.

2826
02:29:20,010 --> 02:29:22,330
How do I get...

2827
02:29:22,330 --> 02:29:24,730
I don't even have an engine.

2828
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:30,810
Okay, give it to me straight guys.

2829
02:29:31,170 --> 02:29:33,110
Is my engine even like...

2830
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:37,110
Is it even like 30% done?

2831
02:29:37,630 --> 02:29:38,530
Like I need a...

2832
02:29:38,530 --> 02:29:39,090
No, can I drink?

2833
02:29:39,370 --> 02:29:40,290
Oh wait, that's not water.

2834
02:29:40,410 --> 02:29:41,130
That's just texture.

2835
02:29:41,370 --> 02:29:42,950
That's just fucked up texture.

2836
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:46,970
That's literally just tree PNG right here.

2837
02:29:47,510 --> 02:29:47,990
No.

2838
02:29:48,690 --> 02:29:49,970
What is...

2839
02:29:49,970 --> 02:29:52,630
How far is my engine?

2840
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:55,350
I'm like...

2841
02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:57,970
I'm 50%?!

2842
02:29:58,570 --> 02:30:00,230
There's no way.

2843
02:30:00,390 --> 02:30:05,110
There's no way I'm just 50% done.

2844
02:30:05,810 --> 02:30:08,930
I piece so much of the engine.

2845
02:30:10,110 --> 02:30:12,710
I piece so much.

2846
02:30:13,210 --> 02:30:14,610
There's no way.

2847
02:30:14,610 --> 02:30:17,390
Please, I'm so hungry.

2848
02:30:17,630 --> 02:30:19,710
My parents left me.

2849
02:30:20,530 --> 02:30:23,010
There has to be a car.

2850
02:30:25,490 --> 02:30:26,810
Where are any of...

2851
02:30:26,810 --> 02:30:27,430
I just...

2852
02:30:27,430 --> 02:30:30,810
I just wanted to finish the engine.

2853
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:35,250
Why can't the en...

2854
02:30:35,250 --> 02:30:37,290
Why can't it just be like IKEA?

2855
02:30:37,890 --> 02:30:40,090
I wish they deport me to Sweden.

2856
02:30:40,290 --> 02:30:41,390
At least I get a...

2857
02:30:41,390 --> 02:30:44,950
At least it be simple to build like an IKEA chair.

2858
02:30:50,710 --> 02:30:52,070
At least...

2859
02:30:52,070 --> 02:30:54,730
At least I can build it like...

2860
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:57,470
I want an IKEA engine.

2861
02:30:59,350 --> 02:31:00,590
An IKEA...

2862
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:03,490
You know, I'm surprised IKEA hasn't made an IKEA car yet.

2863
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:05,330
I'm really surprised.

2864
02:31:05,850 --> 02:31:06,570
I think...

2865
02:31:06,570 --> 02:31:10,090
I think if like IKEA made their own IKEA car...

2866
02:31:10,090 --> 02:31:11,730
It would be so affordable.

2867
02:31:12,250 --> 02:31:13,390
And like...

2868
02:31:13,390 --> 02:31:15,130
Less potential to explode.

2869
02:31:15,470 --> 02:31:16,770
Versus a Cybertruck.

2870
02:31:17,010 --> 02:31:17,690
I think.

2871
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:21,290
As long as there's like less possibilities to explode like a Cybertruck.

2872
02:31:21,410 --> 02:31:23,330
I think it's like a win.

2873
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:26,430
Don't care IKEA car will need you.

2874
02:31:26,770 --> 02:31:27,290
Exactly.

2875
02:31:27,610 --> 02:31:30,210
If I'm gonna build my own fucking car.

2876
02:31:30,330 --> 02:31:31,830
Might as well go to IKEA.

2877
02:31:33,470 --> 02:31:35,670
That's not a hype part.

2878
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:45,660
Also, I found it very hilarious that...

2879
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:47,160
People found out that...

2880
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:47,660
I mean...

2881
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:48,940
Oh no, I'm gonna die.

2882
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:50,120
Can I drink lake water?

2883
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:52,820
Guys, what happens if I drink lake water?

2884
02:31:53,300 --> 02:31:54,580
It won't be that bad, right?

2885
02:31:57,320 --> 02:31:58,860
Guys, can I...

2886
02:31:58,860 --> 02:31:59,420
Okay, good.

2887
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:00,520
I'm gonna head to the lake.

2888
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:03,120
Oh my god, I'm gonna head to the lake, guys.

2889
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:04,640
I'm gonna head over there.

2890
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:07,840
Oh my god, I hope I don't like sleep in...

2891
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:13,340
I mean like brain-eating amoeba.

2892
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:14,180
Like it's just...

2893
02:32:14,180 --> 02:32:15,040
It's like gambling.

2894
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:16,040
Guys.

2895
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:17,780
You gotta take risk.

2896
02:32:18,580 --> 02:32:20,920
Not every lake can have brain-eating amoebas.

2897
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:22,820
Am I drinking it?

2898
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:24,300
How do I drink it?

2899
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:26,800
Guys, why won't it let me drink it?

2900
02:32:27,260 --> 02:32:28,880
I hope I go faster though.

2901
02:32:30,180 --> 02:32:31,720
Guys, it's not letting me drink.

2902
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:37,560
Wait, I can drink?

2903
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:40,260
You guys told me I can drink lake water!

2904
02:32:42,820 --> 02:32:43,940
Oh my god.

2905
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:44,800
But it's faster.

2906
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:45,920
It was faster though.

2907
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:46,640
I'm gonna swim.

2908
02:32:48,480 --> 02:32:50,160
I'm gonna swim home.

2909
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:52,000
It is faster though.

2910
02:32:53,660 --> 02:32:55,840
Swimming home is faster than walking.

2911
02:32:56,440 --> 02:32:59,060
They're a bunch of liars.

2912
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:00,440
Please!

2913
02:33:00,700 --> 02:33:03,560
I worked so hard on the end!

2914
02:33:03,700 --> 02:33:04,060
Please!

2915
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:05,940
They can't do this to me!

2916
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,300
Why did I leave my bike?

2917
02:33:10,380 --> 02:33:12,900
Why did you stop me, chat?

2918
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:22,540
Why did you stop me?

2919
02:33:27,150 --> 02:33:29,450
I didn't even save!

2920
02:33:30,970 --> 02:33:32,930
Okay, I should be close, right?

2921
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:35,370
Am I close?

2922
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:38,070
Am I even close to home?

2923
02:33:39,250 --> 02:33:41,090
You got away.

2924
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:46,910
If grandma has to die, then so be it.

2925
02:33:49,090 --> 02:33:50,910
Oh no, I should have followed the road.

2926
02:33:51,010 --> 02:33:51,810
I'm lost now.

2927
02:33:52,070 --> 02:33:52,710
I think...

2928
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:53,070
Oh my god.

2929
02:33:53,150 --> 02:33:55,290
I don't even know if I'm close to home.

2930
02:33:55,510 --> 02:33:57,530
Am I even close to home?

2931
02:33:57,830 --> 02:33:59,750
I can't even tell!

2932
02:34:00,550 --> 02:34:03,890
I have a PNG wall blocking me!

2933
02:34:09,090 --> 02:34:13,870
I have a tree PNG blocking me from the road!

2934
02:34:17,050 --> 02:34:19,070
Oh my god!

2935
02:34:20,410 --> 02:34:21,450
Oh no!

2936
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:24,230
Oh no!

2937
02:34:25,290 --> 02:34:28,130
Why did my parents leave me alone?

2938
02:34:29,150 --> 02:34:31,110
I don't understand!

2939
02:34:33,350 --> 02:34:35,670
Why would they just leave?

2940
02:34:38,770 --> 02:34:40,290
Wait, I'm close!

2941
02:34:40,370 --> 02:34:41,010
I'm close by!

2942
02:34:41,590 --> 02:34:43,550
I'm so close to home, guys!

2943
02:34:45,950 --> 02:34:46,550
Guys!

2944
02:34:47,770 --> 02:34:49,610
This is just a survival...

2945
02:34:49,610 --> 02:34:51,570
Guys, I remembered those houses!

2946
02:34:52,370 --> 02:34:53,590
Guys, there's my house!

2947
02:34:54,630 --> 02:34:56,010
Oh my god, there's civilization!

2948
02:34:56,910 --> 02:34:57,830
There it is!

2949
02:34:58,890 --> 02:35:00,070
There it is!

2950
02:35:00,150 --> 02:35:01,450
I'm gonna make it!

2951
02:35:06,320 --> 02:35:07,340
Oh my god.

2952
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:09,840
Oh my god, it's right there!

2953
02:35:12,500 --> 02:35:13,920
Wait, that's not my home.

2954
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:15,860
Wait, that's not my home.

2955
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:17,000
Which way was home?

2956
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:17,880
Oh, there it is!

2957
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:18,740
There it is right here!

2958
02:35:19,020 --> 02:35:19,720
It's right there!

2959
02:35:19,980 --> 02:35:20,920
I'm gonna make it!

2960
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:23,800
I went to the wrong house, but I'm gonna make it home!

2961
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:25,460
I'm gonna make it home!

2962
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:26,440
I'm gonna drink!

2963
02:35:31,300 --> 02:35:32,680
Turn on the tap water!

2964
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:34,060
Turn on the tap water!

2965
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:35,140
Drink!

2966
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:38,040
Drink like your life depends on it!

2967
02:35:38,640 --> 02:35:39,660
Drink like it!

2968
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:42,080
Oh god, I'm gonna do it!

2969
02:35:42,140 --> 02:35:42,380
Okay.

2970
02:35:43,220 --> 02:35:43,940
I got it.

2971
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:45,120
Oh my god, I knew it.

2972
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:46,380
I knew I was gonna live.

2973
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:48,980
Called me.

2974
02:35:50,300 --> 02:35:52,180
What the fuck was that?

2975
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:54,140
Alright, now I gotta sleep.

2976
02:35:55,020 --> 02:35:55,880
Alright, sleep time!

2977
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:57,800
Sleep time!

2978
02:35:58,720 --> 02:35:59,680
We live.

2979
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:00,680
I knew it, guys.

2980
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:03,900
I fucking knew I couldn't live.

2981
02:36:08,220 --> 02:36:08,860
Alright.

2982
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:12,780
Wait, who's calling me this late at night?

2983
02:36:15,540 --> 02:36:16,520
Who's that?

2984
02:36:20,220 --> 02:36:21,940
Who the fuck is that?

2985
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:33,230
Oh, is that my uncle?

2986
02:36:39,830 --> 02:36:40,670
Alright, goodbye.

2987
02:36:41,710 --> 02:36:42,390
Sorry, uncle.

2988
02:36:42,510 --> 02:36:45,130
I gotta figure out how to fucking build my...

2989
02:36:45,530 --> 02:36:47,550
I gotta figure out how to build my engine first.

2990
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:48,850
Oh no, I'm about to starve.

2991
02:36:48,970 --> 02:36:49,830
This is not good.

2992
02:36:49,930 --> 02:36:51,310
I don't know if I...

2993
02:36:51,310 --> 02:36:51,790
Oh, okay.

2994
02:36:52,210 --> 02:36:53,130
Okay, that's good.

2995
02:36:53,610 --> 02:36:55,850
We fixed that, but this is literally my last meal.

2996
02:36:56,870 --> 02:36:58,450
Oh, it's my last meal.

2997
02:36:58,450 --> 02:37:00,890
We gotta build an engine before it's too late.

2998
02:37:01,370 --> 02:37:02,470
Okay, and then...

2999
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:03,710
Alright.

3000
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:06,010
Okay, it's time.

3001
02:37:07,410 --> 02:37:09,450
It's thermostat time.

3002
02:37:10,570 --> 02:37:11,130
Okay.

3003
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:15,360
Alright, here we go.

3004
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:17,180
This is it.

3005
02:37:17,380 --> 02:37:18,520
We're gonna build our engine.

3006
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:21,360
We gotta take a shower first.

3007
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:23,640
But I'll be clean a little bit longer.

3008
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:26,440
Oh my god.

3009
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:27,480
But...

3010
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:29,520
It's okay.

3011
02:37:31,660 --> 02:37:33,460
I'm gonna be clean a little bit.

3012
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,540
And then I'll pee in the shower to raise...

3013
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:36,120
It's okay.

3014
02:37:38,280 --> 02:37:39,060
It's okay.

3015
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:42,500
I'm gonna raise productivity by peeing in the shower while taking a shower.

3016
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:43,840
So I don't waste money.

3017
02:37:45,220 --> 02:37:46,100
It's alright.

3018
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:48,560
Look at me being productive right now.

3019
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,800
Okay, and then...

3020
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:51,320
Oh my...

3021
02:37:51,320 --> 02:37:52,000
You know what, fuck it.

3022
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:52,960
I don't need the sauna.

3023
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:55,240
It's fine.

3024
02:37:57,220 --> 02:37:58,680
You know what, fuck it.

3025
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:00,320
We don't need the sauna, guys.

3026
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:01,980
I think it'll be fine.

3027
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:04,480
I think if I just keep swearing...

3028
02:38:04,480 --> 02:38:07,440
If I just keep swearing like 24x7...

3029
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:09,480
Things will be okay.

3030
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:10,940
Okay, I just realized I have no light.

3031
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,560
Might as well do the sauna.

3032
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:15,680
Until the sun comes up.

3033
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:19,740
Nevermind.

3034
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:21,820
Because the sun isn't up yet.

3035
02:38:21,900 --> 02:38:24,940
I might as well do the sauna until then.

3036
02:38:24,940 --> 02:38:26,620
So I'll be less stressed out.

3037
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:27,540
Alright, guys.

3038
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:30,220
Be real with me.

3039
02:38:31,320 --> 02:38:33,620
How much do I have left for the engine?

3040
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:36,220
Just be real with me, guys.

3041
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:41,900
How bad is it?

3042
02:38:42,280 --> 02:38:47,120
How bad is it, guys?

3043
02:38:47,380 --> 02:38:50,100
You're giving me so different numbers, guys.

3044
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:51,020
I can't tell.

3045
02:38:52,380 --> 02:38:54,640
I can't tell how bad it is.

3046
02:38:54,940 --> 02:38:55,580
Not terrible?

3047
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:56,560
70%?

3048
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:57,020
Alright.

3049
02:38:57,860 --> 02:38:59,200
Alright, so it'll be fine.

3050
02:39:03,140 --> 02:39:04,180
You're like 10%.

3051
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:05,400
Okay, just the engine.

3052
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:08,400
I don't care about the rest of the car, guys.

3053
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:09,100
I just...

3054
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:10,000
I just need...

3055
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:13,300
If we finish the engine, it's a fucking win in my book.

3056
02:39:13,380 --> 02:39:13,600
Okay?

3057
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:20,580
Finishing the engine is a fucking win.

3058
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:22,060
I'm gonna say it.

3059
02:39:23,500 --> 02:39:25,020
We're just gonna finish the engine.

3060
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:25,500
That's...

3061
02:39:26,780 --> 02:39:27,320
That's it.

3062
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:30,780
We win the game if we have a workable engine.

3063
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:31,940
That's it.

3064
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:33,220
I believe in us.

3065
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:35,800
As long as the engine works, it should be fine.

3066
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:37,900
It should be fine.

3067
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:40,180
That's all we need.

3068
02:39:40,460 --> 02:39:42,640
We just need the engine, guys.

3069
02:39:44,740 --> 02:39:46,940
To be fair, a car doesn't need anything else.

3070
02:39:47,500 --> 02:39:48,120
If a car...

3071
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:49,780
A car can just be an engine...

3072
02:39:50,340 --> 02:39:53,840
A car can literally just be an engine and wheels.

3073
02:39:54,360 --> 02:39:55,820
Like, what else does it need?

3074
02:39:55,820 --> 02:39:56,860
And...

3075
02:39:56,860 --> 02:39:58,900
And maybe a steering wheel.

3076
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,220
Legitimately, I could just drive a car with just an engine and wheels.

3077
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:05,080
As long as it goes vroom vroom.

3078
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:08,760
Who needs brakes, guys?

3079
02:40:09,660 --> 02:40:10,500
I'll just make...

3080
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:11,620
I'll just slow down.

3081
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,440
Do we really need brakes if I just slow down the car, you know?

3082
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:22,260
It'll be fine.

3083
02:40:23,620 --> 02:40:24,920
Is it warmed up yet?

3084
02:40:28,840 --> 02:40:30,000
Is it working?

3085
02:40:30,700 --> 02:40:32,020
I can't tell.

3086
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:35,020
The PP is still at 40-30 degrees.

3087
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:39,720
You can't cut funding, you'll regret this.

3088
02:40:39,900 --> 02:40:40,920
Tell that to Honda.

3089
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:42,680
During 2010.

3090
02:40:43,700 --> 02:40:45,800
Sorry, please Honda, don't go after me.

3091
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:50,280
Yeah,

3092
02:40:55,670 --> 02:40:57,990
thank you for the super chat.

3093
02:40:58,170 --> 02:40:59,570
Thank you, thank you.

3094
02:41:00,190 --> 02:41:02,110
It's oddly specific.

3095
02:41:06,910 --> 02:41:09,630
Yeah, imagine your Uber showed up and it was a car.

3096
02:41:10,130 --> 02:41:11,070
Oh, it's Toyota?

3097
02:41:14,870 --> 02:41:17,250
Alright, it could be any car brand.

3098
02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:22,670
To be fair, I think every car brand had that issue.

3099
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:23,450
I'm pretty sure.

3100
02:41:23,570 --> 02:41:23,990
Let me look.

3101
02:41:26,110 --> 02:41:28,630
I'm pretty sure it's just not...

3102
02:41:29,390 --> 02:41:31,110
It's not just...

3103
02:41:31,730 --> 02:41:34,630
It's not just Toyota.

3104
02:41:35,550 --> 02:41:36,610
I'm pretty sure.

3105
02:41:38,410 --> 02:41:39,390
Okay.

3106
02:41:41,270 --> 02:41:41,890
Controversy.

3107
02:41:46,570 --> 02:41:49,990
Wait, in 2023.

3108
02:41:51,250 --> 02:41:57,570
Honda recalled 500,000 vehicles in the US and Canada.

3109
02:41:57,570 --> 02:42:02,610
Due to front seat belts that could break open in a crash.

3110
02:42:02,690 --> 02:42:07,130
Okay, this was 2023, guys.

3111
02:42:09,090 --> 02:42:11,810
Wait, what happened in 2023?

3112
02:42:12,510 --> 02:42:19,870
In 2023, Honda recalled about 4.5 million vehicles globally due to fuel pump failures.

3113
02:42:19,870 --> 02:42:29,610
In 2023, Honda recalled 249,000 in the US due to a defect in the engine crankshaft.

3114
02:42:29,950 --> 02:42:38,110
How much in 2023 were filed against Honda for defective electric power steering systems?

3115
02:42:41,150 --> 02:42:44,530
Oh my god, excuse me.

3116
02:42:45,150 --> 02:42:48,850
Okay, so I was like, um, doki, that was Toyota.

3117
02:42:52,410 --> 02:42:53,370
That's just...

3118
02:42:54,850 --> 02:42:58,150
Sorry, I'm talking about...

3119
02:42:58,150 --> 02:42:58,950
It's not just...

3120
02:42:58,950 --> 02:43:00,330
Let me go with Toyota.

3121
02:43:00,430 --> 02:43:01,990
Let me call it Toyota, too.

3122
02:43:02,070 --> 02:43:03,730
So, like, we hit all the benchmarks.

3123
02:43:04,290 --> 02:43:07,670
We're never getting the Honda sponsor now.

3124
02:43:07,970 --> 02:43:09,350
Guys, what happened...

3125
02:43:09,350 --> 02:43:11,510
Guys, we never talked about...

3126
02:43:11,510 --> 02:43:12,010
Everyone...

3127
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:12,710
Guys, forget...

3128
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:14,270
We never talked about it, guys.

3129
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:18,290
It happened for, like, 30 seconds in one stream.

3130
02:43:18,290 --> 02:43:22,050
Surely, my history won't catch up on...

3131
02:43:22,050 --> 02:43:25,150
Surely, no one's gonna use this against me, right, guys?

3132
02:43:27,070 --> 02:43:28,230
Oh my god.

3133
02:43:28,550 --> 02:43:30,470
Nobody's gonna keep receipts, right, guys?

3134
02:43:30,530 --> 02:43:31,970
I'm here to build my car.

3135
02:43:32,450 --> 02:43:35,830
After everything I say, it's the Honda that gets me.

3136
02:43:37,010 --> 02:43:40,510
None of these things you wanted to include in your car.

3137
02:43:42,110 --> 02:43:43,310
Um, excuse me.

3138
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:45,430
It was the crankshaft gear.

3139
02:43:45,430 --> 02:43:49,590
Guys, I even got to the seatbelt part of my car.

3140
02:43:49,810 --> 02:43:53,450
And you were damn right I wasn't gonna include seatbelts.

3141
02:43:55,230 --> 02:43:55,910
Alright.

3142
02:43:56,290 --> 02:43:57,550
Am I less stressed now?

3143
02:43:59,250 --> 02:44:01,070
Am I less stressed now?

3144
02:44:04,210 --> 02:44:05,290
Alright, there we go.

3145
02:44:06,310 --> 02:44:07,050
Is this good?

3146
02:44:07,230 --> 02:44:08,650
Okay, I'm still stressed out.

3147
02:44:09,110 --> 02:44:10,270
Jesus Christ.

3148
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,320
Can't believe it.

3149
02:44:15,320 --> 02:44:17,120
I'm still fucking stressed out.

3150
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:19,640
Okay, what if I do sauna and also swear?

3151
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:23,760
Then maybe, like, I get to complete both things.

3152
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:28,380
It's okay, we can still get the Hugo Sponsor shit.

3153
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:31,640
Maybe Toyota will sponsor me after, you know?

3154
02:44:31,980 --> 02:44:32,500
Toyota?

3155
02:44:34,540 --> 02:44:38,100
Maybe I can get the Toyota sponsor from that.

3156
02:44:38,220 --> 02:44:39,240
It'll be like, woah.

3157
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:40,900
You know what?

3158
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,680
Or maybe BMW.

3159
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:49,540
BMW, Subaru, Chevrolet, Toyota, Hyundai, Ford.

3160
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:51,000
Okay, guys.

3161
02:44:51,540 --> 02:44:53,340
I'm not blacklisted there.

3162
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:04,720
You ain't BMW.

3163
02:45:05,340 --> 02:45:09,600
What makes somebody BMW material?

3164
02:45:13,300 --> 02:45:13,900
Like...

3165
02:45:13,900 --> 02:45:18,920
It's awkward for anybody that made a Doki Tasha Honda car now.

3166
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:19,920
They're like, woah.

3167
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:25,980
Okay, now I should be good, right?

3168
02:45:28,840 --> 02:45:30,540
Alright, let's see.

3169
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:32,660
Let me crank that down.

3170
02:45:34,040 --> 02:45:35,800
Alright, I should be okay now.

3171
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:36,880
I'm less stressed now.

3172
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:39,500
Alright, is it daytime yet?

3173
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:42,720
I was in the sauna for a while now.

3174
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:44,960
How dark is it outside?

3175
02:45:45,180 --> 02:45:47,140
No, it's still- Oh wait, no, it's starting to get brighter.

3176
02:45:48,860 --> 02:45:49,300
Alright.

3177
02:45:51,400 --> 02:45:53,980
Oh wait, I forgot to close the fridge door?

3178
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:57,000
Oh my god, there's like a lot of things I've forgotten.

3179
02:45:57,220 --> 02:45:58,360
Oh my god, you're right.

3180
02:45:59,260 --> 02:46:00,320
Alright, there we go.

3181
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:03,060
Oh, and I need a drink.

3182
02:46:05,140 --> 02:46:06,060
Slurp, slurp, slurp.

3183
02:46:06,060 --> 02:46:07,640
Slurp, slurp, slurp.

3184
02:46:08,940 --> 02:46:09,500
Okay.

3185
02:46:10,480 --> 02:46:11,040
Alright.

3186
02:46:14,440 --> 02:46:16,280
Everything should be fine now.

3187
02:46:17,040 --> 02:46:18,540
I should be okay, guys.

3188
02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:20,200
Oh, it's still so dark.

3189
02:46:20,820 --> 02:46:21,900
Do I have lights in the garage?

3190
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:22,500
I do.

3191
02:46:22,620 --> 02:46:23,300
Alright, guys.

3192
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:27,460
What else do I need- Guys, we just gotta finish the engine.

3193
02:46:27,740 --> 02:46:28,560
That's our goal.

3194
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:33,120
That's literally- We just need to finish the engine.

3195
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:35,980
And we'll be- Just, please.

3196
02:46:35,980 --> 02:46:36,980
Please.

3197
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:39,880
I just- I just wanna finish my engine.

3198
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:41,640
That's all I want in life.

3199
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:42,400
Please.

3200
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:46,160
It just- What do we need?

3201
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:47,580
The top part?

3202
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:49,080
What's- Is this the top?

3203
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:52,420
Is it this?

3204
02:46:53,260 --> 02:46:54,580
Why is it not screwed yet?

3205
02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:00,120
Spark plugs and alternator belt?

3206
02:47:01,220 --> 02:47:02,520
What is that?

3207
02:47:03,320 --> 02:47:05,040
Inspection cover, battery.

3208
02:47:05,980 --> 02:47:08,100
Don't have spark plugs here.

3209
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:12,120
You guys are saying lots of words, guys.

3210
02:47:12,220 --> 02:47:17,080
You guys- You guys are saying a lot of words.

3211
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:20,560
Oh, alternator.

3212
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:22,940
But where does the alternator go?

3213
02:47:24,820 --> 02:47:27,600
Where the fuck does it go?

3214
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:36,480
There's no- There's no check marks anywhere.

3215
02:47:36,480 --> 02:47:36,760
Where?

3216
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:40,200
On the engine?

3217
02:47:41,060 --> 02:47:41,460
Silly.

3218
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:42,060
Oh, wait.

3219
02:47:43,400 --> 02:47:44,160
There's a check mark.

3220
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:45,580
There's a check mark.

3221
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:47,320
I have no idea where you're supposed to go.

3222
02:47:47,720 --> 02:47:49,200
But I saw a check mark in here.

3223
02:47:51,960 --> 02:47:52,760
Where is it?

3224
02:47:55,780 --> 02:47:56,460
Where is it?

3225
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:57,560
I know you exist.

3226
02:47:58,180 --> 02:47:59,240
I know you- Oh.

3227
02:47:59,740 --> 02:48:00,160
Right here.

3228
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:01,720
Oh my god, I did it.

3229
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:02,440
Oh my god.

3230
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:04,260
You're a fucking genius, Doki.

3231
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:05,700
Oh my god.

3232
02:48:05,700 --> 02:48:06,860
Okay, alternator.

3233
02:48:07,600 --> 02:48:10,140
And then I need a belt of some sort.

3234
02:48:11,300 --> 02:48:12,640
Should be here somewhere.

3235
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:14,460
I saw that belt.

3236
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:18,680
Should be here.

3237
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:20,200
Handbrake.

3238
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:21,140
Oh, we don't need that.

3239
02:48:21,320 --> 02:48:21,780
Bracer.

3240
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:23,040
We don't need that.

3241
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:25,960
I shouldn't say- I shouldn't say what I was gonna say.

3242
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:32,700
I had to buy a belt?!

3243
02:48:33,800 --> 02:48:35,680
Okay, what do I have that's here?

3244
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:38,860
Is there anything else?

3245
02:48:40,820 --> 02:48:44,380
Is there anything else I can put on this engine that's here?

3246
02:48:47,040 --> 02:48:48,320
Did I do it?

3247
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:53,800
Timing belt and timing covers.

3248
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:56,080
Oh my god.

3249
02:48:56,120 --> 02:48:57,680
Where is that?

3250
02:48:57,960 --> 02:48:58,460
Oh, oh.

3251
02:48:58,600 --> 02:48:59,300
Timing covers.

3252
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:05,240
Should be this, right?

3253
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:08,100
Should go over there.

3254
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:11,860
Oh.

3255
02:49:13,100 --> 02:49:13,880
Timing belt.

3256
02:49:14,020 --> 02:49:14,340
Okay, okay.

3257
02:49:14,380 --> 02:49:15,540
I need a tool.

3258
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:20,160
Make sure everything's bolted down.

3259
02:49:24,980 --> 02:49:26,280
Is this bolted down?

3260
02:49:31,390 --> 02:49:31,990
Okay.

3261
02:49:32,550 --> 02:49:33,150
Here we go.

3262
02:49:34,030 --> 02:49:35,250
Alright, this is bolted.

3263
02:49:40,360 --> 02:49:42,020
I don't know what's a pulley, guys.

3264
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:44,040
I don't know what's a pulley.

3265
02:49:44,480 --> 02:49:48,040
I don't know what you mean when you say pulley.

3266
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:51,340
What does that mean?

3267
02:49:51,700 --> 02:49:53,420
I don't know.

3268
02:49:54,820 --> 02:49:57,180
I don't- what's the pulley?

3269
02:49:59,240 --> 02:50:02,020
They all look the same.

3270
02:50:03,140 --> 02:50:05,920
Everything just looks the same.

3271
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:09,880
Alright.

3272
02:50:12,520 --> 02:50:14,460
Wait, I saw a check mark.

3273
02:50:15,780 --> 02:50:16,700
Okay.

3274
02:50:17,020 --> 02:50:17,960
There we go.

3275
02:50:21,280 --> 02:50:22,800
It should go in somewhere.

3276
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:24,360
Where should this go?

3277
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:25,980
Stop crying.

3278
02:50:28,180 --> 02:50:30,900
A mechanic doesn't cry.

3279
02:50:33,400 --> 02:50:34,780
What's the pulley?

3280
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:38,800
None of this says pulley.

3281
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:42,260
What the fuck do you mean, pulley?

3282
02:50:43,180 --> 02:50:44,000
Like, what?

3283
02:50:47,410 --> 02:50:49,450
Take off the crankshaft?

3284
02:50:49,810 --> 02:50:52,890
The fuck you mean, crankshaft?

3285
02:50:55,670 --> 02:50:57,470
Mechanics never cry.

3286
02:51:00,270 --> 02:51:01,990
Oh my god.

3287
02:51:03,790 --> 02:51:04,530
Blue circle.

3288
02:51:04,690 --> 02:51:06,450
There's a blue circle hole?

3289
02:51:08,390 --> 02:51:09,970
It's just all grey.

3290
02:51:10,570 --> 02:51:14,610
It's just all grey with occasional gold.

3291
02:51:16,510 --> 02:51:18,110
Oh my god.

3292
02:51:19,290 --> 02:51:20,530
God, just deport me.

3293
02:51:20,710 --> 02:51:23,570
Just deport me from Finland.

3294
02:51:23,570 --> 02:51:25,810
Oh my god.

3295
02:51:26,730 --> 02:51:29,530
Just deport me.

3296
02:51:33,710 --> 02:51:35,230
I can't.

3297
02:51:36,150 --> 02:51:37,590
I fucking can't.

3298
02:51:38,890 --> 02:51:41,510
I'm not strong enough.

3299
02:51:44,490 --> 02:51:45,690
I'm not.

3300
02:51:45,730 --> 02:51:47,710
I'm not strong enough.

3301
02:51:49,090 --> 02:51:51,090
Oh my god.

3302
02:51:55,930 --> 02:51:56,990
It's okay.

3303
02:51:57,090 --> 02:51:57,850
I'm fine.

3304
02:51:58,090 --> 02:51:59,610
I'm so fine.

3305
02:51:59,850 --> 02:52:02,230
I'm so fine.

3306
02:52:03,510 --> 02:52:05,430
Everything will be okay.

3307
02:52:06,170 --> 02:52:07,010
Everything.

3308
02:52:07,410 --> 02:52:10,790
What the fuck does this mean?

3309
02:52:14,230 --> 02:52:15,330
I can't.

3310
02:52:15,450 --> 02:52:16,850
What does this mean?

3311
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:19,310
I can't.

3312
02:52:19,730 --> 02:52:22,850
I'm using mechanical vision and I...

3313
02:52:23,850 --> 02:52:25,150
What does this...

3314
02:52:25,150 --> 02:52:27,230
What does this mean?

3315
02:52:27,670 --> 02:52:33,810
What does all of this mean?

3316
02:52:34,390 --> 02:52:35,230
I can't...

3317
02:52:35,230 --> 02:52:38,230
Even if I actually followed this, I...

3318
02:52:38,230 --> 02:52:39,810
I can't even...

3319
02:52:39,810 --> 02:52:43,230
I can't even process any of this.

3320
02:52:43,650 --> 02:52:45,510
What does that mean?

3321
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:52,160
Even if I actually looked up a tutorial, I can't...

3322
02:52:52,850 --> 02:52:53,250
I...

3323
02:52:53,250 --> 02:52:57,290
I can't even figure this out.

3324
02:52:57,550 --> 02:53:00,130
I don't even know where I'm at anymore.

3325
02:53:00,730 --> 02:53:04,910
Where am I at in this fucking stupid ass engine?

3326
02:53:05,830 --> 02:53:07,190
I can't.

3327
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:09,270
I can't.

3328
02:53:09,470 --> 02:53:10,290
Oh my god.

3329
02:53:11,010 --> 02:53:12,650
Oh my god.

3330
02:53:12,730 --> 02:53:13,190
I'm okay.

3331
02:53:13,550 --> 02:53:14,670
I'm okay.

3332
02:53:15,490 --> 02:53:17,410
I'm okay, guys.

3333
02:53:17,510 --> 02:53:18,230
I'm okay.

3334
02:53:18,710 --> 02:53:19,810
Oh my god.

3335
02:53:19,850 --> 02:53:21,350
I'm so okay, everyone.

3336
02:53:21,350 --> 02:53:23,030
I'm okay, guys.

3337
02:53:23,330 --> 02:53:25,070
Oh my god, guys.

3338
02:53:25,170 --> 02:53:26,550
Oh my god.

3339
02:53:26,630 --> 02:53:27,190
Wow.

3340
02:53:27,590 --> 02:53:28,150
Oops.

3341
02:53:28,310 --> 02:53:29,190
Oh my god.

3342
02:53:29,250 --> 02:53:29,710
Wow.

3343
02:53:30,030 --> 02:53:30,310
Whoa.

3344
02:53:30,430 --> 02:53:30,730
Sorry.

3345
02:53:30,910 --> 02:53:34,990
My game feed, it like flickered off.

3346
02:53:35,150 --> 02:53:36,230
Oh my god.

3347
02:53:36,270 --> 02:53:37,890
What the fuck happened?

3348
02:53:39,650 --> 02:53:41,030
Oh my god.

3349
02:53:41,130 --> 02:53:42,110
My game feed.

3350
02:53:42,230 --> 02:53:42,490
Don't worry.

3351
02:53:42,590 --> 02:53:43,750
I can fix this, guys.

3352
02:53:44,490 --> 02:53:45,050
Wow.

3353
02:53:45,330 --> 02:53:46,130
I can...

3354
02:53:46,130 --> 02:53:46,610
Wow.

3355
02:53:46,730 --> 02:53:48,090
I did it, guys.

3356
02:53:49,090 --> 02:53:51,470
I fucking did it.

3357
02:53:51,470 --> 02:53:53,110
Oh my god.

3358
02:53:53,130 --> 02:53:54,690
I did it.

3359
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:56,090
I built the engine.

3360
02:53:56,870 --> 02:54:00,110
I did it.

3361
02:54:00,670 --> 02:54:01,230
I...

3362
02:54:01,230 --> 02:54:02,350
Oh my god.

3363
02:54:03,270 --> 02:54:04,870
I fucking...

3364
02:54:04,870 --> 02:54:05,710
Oh my god.

3365
02:54:05,830 --> 02:54:06,130
I...

3366
02:54:06,130 --> 02:54:07,230
Oh my god.

3367
02:54:07,410 --> 02:54:09,310
I figured it out, everybody.

3368
02:54:09,970 --> 02:54:10,450
I...

3369
02:54:10,450 --> 02:54:16,350
Guys, it only took me three hours and I did it.

3370
02:54:16,530 --> 02:54:17,090
I built...

3371
02:54:17,710 --> 02:54:18,310
I built...

3372
02:54:18,310 --> 02:54:18,650
I built...

3373
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:21,890
I built my engine, everyone.

3374
02:54:22,130 --> 02:54:24,770
You guys thought I couldn't do it.

3375
02:54:25,030 --> 02:54:27,910
But look who's laughing now.

3376
02:54:28,550 --> 02:54:29,430
I...

3377
02:54:29,430 --> 02:54:31,710
Oh my god.

3378
02:54:33,220 --> 02:54:34,490
That's right.

3379
02:54:35,610 --> 02:54:38,330
All live on stream.

3380
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:42,430
Right here.

3381
02:54:42,910 --> 02:54:43,850
Right now.

3382
02:54:43,950 --> 02:54:46,950
It only took us three hours.

3383
02:54:46,950 --> 02:54:49,250
And oh my god.

3384
02:54:49,470 --> 02:54:49,770
Let me...

3385
02:54:49,770 --> 02:54:50,210
Oh my...

3386
02:54:50,210 --> 02:54:50,510
Wait.

3387
02:54:51,090 --> 02:54:51,650
Sorry.

3388
02:54:52,010 --> 02:54:52,850
Watch this.

3389
02:54:53,370 --> 02:54:53,930
Whoa.

3390
02:54:54,930 --> 02:54:55,490
Okay.

3391
02:54:56,110 --> 02:54:56,530
All right.

3392
02:54:56,650 --> 02:54:57,670
Watch this, guys.

3393
02:54:57,790 --> 02:54:59,110
I'm going to show you guys.

3394
02:54:59,350 --> 02:55:00,790
I'm holding my engine.

3395
02:55:01,190 --> 02:55:02,470
You don't see it, guys.

3396
02:55:02,530 --> 02:55:03,290
You don't see it right now.

3397
02:55:03,310 --> 02:55:05,230
But I'm holding my engine now, guys.

3398
02:55:05,670 --> 02:55:08,110
The engine is being held right now.

3399
02:55:08,410 --> 02:55:10,550
And I'm going to put everything together.

3400
02:55:11,310 --> 02:55:11,850
And then...

3401
02:55:11,850 --> 02:55:12,830
Oh my god.

3402
02:55:12,830 --> 02:55:14,450
It's going to be so crazy.

3403
02:55:14,970 --> 02:55:15,410
Oh my god.

3404
02:55:15,410 --> 02:55:16,930
I'm going to put this engine in.

3405
02:55:17,430 --> 02:55:18,630
Watch this, everyone.

3406
02:55:19,890 --> 02:55:21,070
Watch this.

3407
02:55:21,650 --> 02:55:22,250
All right.

3408
02:55:22,670 --> 02:55:23,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3409
02:55:23,690 --> 02:55:24,070
Let me...

3410
02:55:24,070 --> 02:55:26,990
Let me make sure I'm right here.

3411
02:55:27,710 --> 02:55:30,810
And watch this crazy-ass glitch that I'm going to show you guys.

3412
02:55:30,970 --> 02:55:38,030
I found out this super crazy glitch while I was reading that manual real quick.

3413
02:55:38,270 --> 02:55:39,070
Watch this.

3414
02:55:39,470 --> 02:55:39,810
Okay.

3415
02:55:40,070 --> 02:55:40,450
Okay.

3416
02:55:40,530 --> 02:55:41,270
You see...

3417
02:55:41,270 --> 02:55:42,910
You see that yellow car right there?

3418
02:55:43,370 --> 02:55:43,550
Look.

3419
02:55:43,550 --> 02:55:44,870
Give me a sec.

3420
02:55:44,950 --> 02:55:46,010
You see that yellow car?

3421
02:55:46,670 --> 02:55:47,170
Whoa.

3422
02:55:47,510 --> 02:55:48,090
Okay, okay.

3423
02:55:48,210 --> 02:55:48,750
Oh, sorry.

3424
02:55:48,990 --> 02:55:51,650
The glitch requires me to, like, flicker...

3425
02:55:51,650 --> 02:55:54,070
Do a special thing that flickers it in and out.

3426
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:55,670
And then, like...

3427
02:55:55,670 --> 02:55:57,170
Oh my god!

3428
02:55:58,270 --> 02:55:58,790
What?!

3429
02:56:06,210 --> 02:56:06,810
Did it!

3430
02:56:07,270 --> 02:56:09,270
I made my car!

3431
02:56:10,490 --> 02:56:13,570
Oh my god!

3432
02:56:16,230 --> 02:56:17,270
No way!

3433
02:56:18,570 --> 02:56:19,890
Yeah, it's yellow!

3434
02:56:20,070 --> 02:56:23,510
Just like a god!

3435
02:56:23,510 --> 02:56:26,830
I fucking did it, guys!

3436
02:56:28,250 --> 02:56:30,350
Oh my god!

3437
02:56:30,550 --> 02:56:32,390
I can't believe it!

3438
02:56:32,570 --> 02:56:34,490
I fucking did it!

3439
02:56:34,650 --> 02:56:35,230
It took...

3440
02:56:35,230 --> 02:56:37,010
Oh my god!

3441
02:56:37,430 --> 02:56:40,530
I knew I was a real mechanic, guys.

3442
02:56:40,770 --> 02:56:42,290
I knew...

3443
02:56:42,290 --> 02:56:46,030
I knew I was a real mechanic, everyone.

3444
02:56:46,750 --> 02:56:47,490
It...

3445
02:56:47,490 --> 02:56:47,870
Oh...

3446
02:56:47,870 --> 02:56:48,850
My god.

3447
02:56:49,030 --> 02:56:51,410
Oh, it only took me so long.

3448
02:56:51,410 --> 02:56:55,790
It only took me three hours to piece everything together.

3449
02:56:56,190 --> 02:56:58,730
But I fucking knew it, guys.

3450
02:56:58,990 --> 02:57:00,170
I knew it.

3451
02:57:00,230 --> 02:57:01,710
I knew there was hope for me.

3452
02:57:01,790 --> 02:57:03,750
I don't have to get deported, guys.

3453
02:57:04,310 --> 02:57:04,690
I...

3454
02:57:06,630 --> 02:57:07,510
Oh my god.

3455
02:57:07,590 --> 02:57:09,290
I get to live in Finland.

3456
02:57:09,770 --> 02:57:11,230
I'm so happy.

3457
02:57:11,550 --> 02:57:12,230
I get to...

3458
02:57:12,230 --> 02:57:14,230
I get to stay in Finland.

3459
02:57:15,070 --> 02:57:16,930
Chat, thank you for the super chat.

3460
02:57:17,070 --> 02:57:18,210
Thank you, thank you.

3461
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:20,050
Congrats on building your car.

3462
02:57:20,050 --> 02:57:21,510
You don't have to be deported.

3463
02:57:21,550 --> 02:57:22,690
I get to stay.

3464
02:57:23,390 --> 02:57:25,410
I passed my test.

3465
02:57:26,990 --> 02:57:27,830
No name.

3466
02:57:27,970 --> 02:57:29,810
What's the broken yellow thing on the bottom?

3467
02:57:29,930 --> 02:57:30,370
There's no...

3468
02:57:30,370 --> 02:57:30,870
What do you mean?

3469
02:57:30,950 --> 02:57:31,930
It's a full car.

3470
02:57:32,530 --> 02:57:32,770
Right?

3471
02:57:32,870 --> 02:57:34,230
That's perspective, guys.

3472
02:57:34,370 --> 02:57:35,510
It's just perspective.

3473
02:57:36,150 --> 02:57:37,210
Thank you for the super chat.

3474
02:57:37,370 --> 02:57:38,090
No name.

3475
02:57:38,210 --> 02:57:39,730
Thank you, thank you.

3476
02:57:41,290 --> 02:57:42,910
Zekra, good job, Doki.

3477
02:57:43,070 --> 02:57:44,010
Now time to...

3478
02:57:44,010 --> 02:57:46,550
Oh, you think I won't be able to drive it?

3479
02:57:46,970 --> 02:57:47,650
Oh, yeah?

3480
02:57:47,950 --> 02:57:49,390
Alright, don't worry, guys.

3481
02:57:49,390 --> 02:57:50,630
Give me a sec.

3482
02:57:50,810 --> 02:57:51,550
Give me...

3483
02:57:53,830 --> 02:57:54,310
Sorry.

3484
02:57:55,510 --> 02:57:56,610
It's so weird.

3485
02:57:56,790 --> 02:57:59,390
This glitch has a thing where, like...

3486
02:58:01,010 --> 02:58:02,330
Like, because I...

3487
02:58:02,330 --> 02:58:06,250
Because, like, I figured out a way to put an engine in it.

3488
02:58:07,130 --> 02:58:07,610
And...

3489
02:58:07,610 --> 02:58:08,930
Put an engine in it.

3490
02:58:08,990 --> 02:58:10,190
And then, like, everything...

3491
02:58:10,190 --> 02:58:14,230
There was a special glitch you can do where everything else just comes together.

3492
02:58:14,390 --> 02:58:15,450
So, like, it just finishes.

3493
02:58:15,450 --> 02:58:20,330
But when you finish the engine and you do the special glitch, everything comes together.

3494
02:58:20,790 --> 02:58:24,730
But it happens so fast that there's a little bit of lag.

3495
02:58:25,110 --> 02:58:26,670
So, like, just give me a sec, guys.

3496
02:58:26,770 --> 02:58:29,290
I'm waiting for the lag to, like...

3497
02:58:29,290 --> 02:58:32,830
I'm just waiting for the lag right now to, like, balance it out.

3498
02:58:32,990 --> 02:58:34,510
So it catches...

3499
02:58:34,510 --> 02:58:36,250
So I can actually move in the game right now.

3500
02:58:36,270 --> 02:58:38,030
So that's why it's, like, buffering at the moment.

3501
02:58:38,370 --> 02:58:39,890
Because of the lag at the moment.

3502
02:58:39,990 --> 02:58:44,310
Because, like, you know, it's trying to compensate for all the stuff that was happening earlier.

3503
02:58:44,650 --> 02:58:46,070
So, give me a sec, guys.

3504
02:58:46,170 --> 02:58:46,710
Give me a sec.

3505
02:58:46,850 --> 02:58:47,810
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

3506
02:58:47,870 --> 02:58:49,370
Because, like, you know...

3507
02:58:49,370 --> 02:58:50,430
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

3508
02:58:50,590 --> 02:58:54,830
Okay, you guys are gonna see some really weird lag real quick, guys.

3509
02:58:54,910 --> 02:58:55,950
Alright, give me a sec.

3510
02:58:56,410 --> 02:58:57,290
Oh, oh my god.

3511
02:58:57,330 --> 02:58:58,110
Alright, there's the car.

3512
02:58:58,170 --> 02:58:59,250
I took the car to the...

3513
02:58:59,250 --> 02:59:00,890
I pushed the car to the road.

3514
02:59:01,210 --> 02:59:01,530
Alright.

3515
02:59:01,750 --> 02:59:02,670
Oh, oh my gosh.

3516
02:59:02,750 --> 02:59:03,090
The lag.

3517
02:59:03,330 --> 02:59:04,230
Okay, I'm gonna...

3518
02:59:04,230 --> 02:59:05,110
Oh, woah!

3519
02:59:05,230 --> 02:59:06,230
What happened to the car?

3520
02:59:06,330 --> 02:59:06,850
It disappeared!

3521
02:59:07,330 --> 02:59:07,830
Oh, don't worry.

3522
02:59:07,890 --> 02:59:08,590
That's just the lag.

3523
02:59:08,890 --> 02:59:12,890
It's just, like, I went closer to the car and, like, clicked on it.

3524
02:59:12,890 --> 02:59:14,990
So, I'm gonna get in the car right now, guys.

3525
02:59:15,150 --> 02:59:17,870
I'm just gonna get in the car right now, okay?

3526
02:59:18,550 --> 02:59:20,130
I'm gonna get...

3527
02:59:24,650 --> 02:59:25,150
Guys,

3528
02:59:28,870 --> 02:59:31,130
it's just a special kind of lag, okay?

3529
02:59:31,490 --> 02:59:32,110
There we go.

3530
02:59:41,060 --> 02:59:42,700
Oh my god!

3531
02:59:43,220 --> 02:59:44,220
I'm in my car!

3532
02:59:44,540 --> 02:59:44,580
Vroom!

3533
02:59:47,760 --> 02:59:49,300
Vroom, everyone!

3534
02:59:53,990 --> 02:59:56,210
We made our car!

3535
02:59:57,270 --> 02:59:58,950
Vroom, vroom!

3536
03:00:02,500 --> 03:00:04,480
We did it, everyone!

3537
03:00:05,240 --> 03:00:06,340
Oh my god!

3538
03:00:07,620 --> 03:00:10,520
Oh my god, it's working!

3539
03:00:11,480 --> 03:00:12,060
Why is...

3540
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:12,820
Okay, there we go.

3541
03:00:13,260 --> 03:00:14,040
There we go.

3542
03:00:14,100 --> 03:00:16,960
Now, it's driving correctly, guys.

3543
03:00:18,140 --> 03:00:18,920
No way!

3544
03:00:19,500 --> 03:00:20,480
Vroom, vroom!

3545
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:22,240
Whoa!

3546
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:25,340
Sick trip!

3547
03:00:26,180 --> 03:00:27,760
It's working, guys!

3548
03:00:28,020 --> 03:00:29,260
It's working!

3549
03:00:30,400 --> 03:00:30,800
Vroom!

3550
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:36,120
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3551
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:37,700
Oh, you don't hear the engine?

3552
03:00:38,060 --> 03:00:38,980
Oh, sorry, sorry.

3553
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:40,020
I turned down my...

3554
03:00:40,020 --> 03:00:41,700
I turned down the volume, guys.

3555
03:00:41,940 --> 03:00:43,000
I turned it down.

3556
03:00:43,120 --> 03:00:43,420
Give me some...

3557
03:00:43,420 --> 03:00:46,640
Let me turn it up because, like, sound guy was like, you should turn...

3558
03:00:46,640 --> 03:00:49,080
You should turn the volume...

3559
03:00:49,080 --> 03:00:50,180
The volume is just right.

3560
03:00:50,180 --> 03:00:53,460
But, like, obviously, we gotta turn up the volume right now.

3561
03:00:53,720 --> 03:00:54,180
So...

3562
03:00:54,180 --> 03:00:54,760
Alright, here we go.

3563
03:00:54,800 --> 03:00:55,400
Don't worry, guys.

3564
03:00:55,420 --> 03:00:55,840
Watch this.

3565
03:00:58,360 --> 03:00:58,620
Alright.

3566
03:00:59,660 --> 03:01:00,700
It should be good.

3567
03:01:01,560 --> 03:01:02,820
Alright, you guys hear it now?

3568
03:01:03,360 --> 03:01:03,740
Whoa!

3569
03:01:07,300 --> 03:01:07,760
Vroom!

3570
03:01:08,300 --> 03:01:09,040
Okay, here we go.

3571
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:10,360
Vroom, vroom, vroom!

3572
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:11,620
Vroom!

3573
03:01:17,130 --> 03:01:17,590
Whoa!

3574
03:01:18,990 --> 03:01:19,450
Vroom!

3575
03:01:19,450 --> 03:01:19,690
Vroom!

3576
03:01:22,310 --> 03:01:23,470
We're doing it!

3577
03:01:23,990 --> 03:01:24,290
Whoa!

3578
03:01:28,570 --> 03:01:29,290
This car...

3579
03:01:29,290 --> 03:01:30,130
Guys, look.

3580
03:01:30,470 --> 03:01:31,650
It's just getting...

3581
03:01:31,650 --> 03:01:32,730
It's revving up, guys.

3582
03:01:32,790 --> 03:01:34,790
It's just revving up, everyone.

3583
03:01:37,230 --> 03:01:38,630
Guys, it's a little shy.

3584
03:01:38,810 --> 03:01:39,510
It's a little shy.

3585
03:01:39,610 --> 03:01:40,850
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

3586
03:01:40,930 --> 03:01:41,450
Okay, let me...

3587
03:01:41,450 --> 03:01:41,830
Let me...

3588
03:01:41,830 --> 03:01:42,550
Let me fix, guys.

3589
03:01:42,590 --> 03:01:42,810
Don't worry.

3590
03:01:42,830 --> 03:01:43,490
I'm fixing the car.

3591
03:01:43,910 --> 03:01:44,250
Let me...

3592
03:01:44,250 --> 03:01:45,030
I'm gonna...

3593
03:01:45,030 --> 03:01:47,530
Let me get out real quick and fix this car, guys.

3594
03:01:47,630 --> 03:01:48,130
Let me...

3595
03:01:48,130 --> 03:01:48,430
Alright.

3596
03:01:49,110 --> 03:01:50,530
Let me get out real quick, guys.

3597
03:01:50,530 --> 03:01:50,950
I'm...

3598
03:01:54,190 --> 03:01:54,850
Don't worry.

3599
03:01:55,010 --> 03:01:55,310
I'll...

3600
03:01:55,310 --> 03:01:58,230
I'm gonna smack it and then it'll go faster.

3601
03:01:58,330 --> 03:01:58,770
I promise.

3602
03:02:00,250 --> 03:02:01,130
I promise.

3603
03:02:01,370 --> 03:02:01,710
Let me...

3604
03:02:01,710 --> 03:02:02,150
Give me a sec.

3605
03:02:02,210 --> 03:02:04,410
I'm gonna smack it so it'll go faster, guys.

3606
03:02:04,810 --> 03:02:05,350
Give me a sec.

3607
03:02:05,670 --> 03:02:06,410
There we go.

3608
03:02:06,650 --> 03:02:07,130
There we go.

3609
03:02:07,170 --> 03:02:08,530
And then I'll be like...

3610
03:02:10,550 --> 03:02:11,730
Alright, there we go.

3611
03:02:12,130 --> 03:02:13,610
Alright, let me...

3612
03:02:14,370 --> 03:02:15,990
Let me get back in.

3613
03:02:16,290 --> 03:02:17,350
Let me get back...

3614
03:02:17,350 --> 03:02:17,610
Okay.

3615
03:02:18,050 --> 03:02:18,310
Okay.

3616
03:02:18,310 --> 03:02:20,830
Okay, now it should be faster, right?

3617
03:02:21,170 --> 03:02:21,650
Okay.

3618
03:02:22,630 --> 03:02:23,210
Alright.

3619
03:02:23,990 --> 03:02:24,890
Don't worry.

3620
03:02:25,770 --> 03:02:26,890
Don't worry.

3621
03:02:27,350 --> 03:02:28,350
Just like...

3622
03:02:28,350 --> 03:02:29,230
Just like...

3623
03:02:29,230 --> 03:02:29,770
There we go.

3624
03:02:29,970 --> 03:02:30,270
Alright.

3625
03:02:31,450 --> 03:02:32,350
Okay, here we go.

3626
03:02:32,890 --> 03:02:33,870
This should be fine, right?

3627
03:02:36,770 --> 03:02:37,090
Alright.

3628
03:02:38,030 --> 03:02:38,630
Don't worry.

3629
03:02:38,830 --> 03:02:39,310
Come on.

3630
03:02:39,590 --> 03:02:40,570
Come on, don't be shy.

3631
03:02:45,670 --> 03:02:46,510
There we go.

3632
03:02:46,510 --> 03:02:46,990
Woah!

3633
03:02:52,560 --> 03:02:59,700
We did it!

3634
03:03:00,420 --> 03:03:01,020
Woah!

3635
03:03:02,640 --> 03:03:04,700
It's so fast!

3636
03:03:04,860 --> 03:03:06,620
It's so fast, everyone!

3637
03:03:08,080 --> 03:03:08,520
Woah!

3638
03:03:11,560 --> 03:03:13,040
This is so...

3639
03:03:13,500 --> 03:03:15,880
Guys, I'm so proud of ourselves, chat.

3640
03:03:15,980 --> 03:03:18,160
That we managed to make a car.

3641
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:21,420
And we did it, everyone.

3642
03:03:21,720 --> 03:03:24,220
We should turn around and head back home, though.

3643
03:03:24,720 --> 03:03:27,300
Let me drive back home.

3644
03:03:27,580 --> 03:03:27,980
Damn.

3645
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:28,900
Alright, guys.

3646
03:03:29,180 --> 03:03:31,060
Alright, I think this is a good time to call it.

3647
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:40,580
We did it!

3648
03:03:40,640 --> 03:03:42,380
We made our car!

3649
03:03:44,480 --> 03:03:46,380
We did it, everyone!

3650
03:03:46,380 --> 03:03:48,700
Oh my god, I knew it.

3651
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:50,340
I knew we could do it, chat.

3652
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:54,940
I knew we could make our fucking car.

3653
03:03:55,300 --> 03:03:56,560
You know what?

3654
03:03:56,680 --> 03:03:58,320
I've always believed in us.

3655
03:03:58,540 --> 03:04:00,480
All the way till the end.

3656
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:02,740
Where are my believers at?

3657
03:04:03,340 --> 03:04:05,000
Where are you guys?

3658
03:04:05,480 --> 03:04:07,000
Who believed in me?

3659
03:04:10,320 --> 03:04:13,880
I knew you guys would've believed in me.

3660
03:04:14,840 --> 03:04:16,700
That's a nice car.

3661
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:19,920
Who witnessed greatness today, everyone?

3662
03:04:21,940 --> 03:04:23,860
Thank you, thank you.

3663
03:04:24,040 --> 03:04:25,120
Doubters, we won.

3664
03:04:25,180 --> 03:04:26,120
No, no, no.

3665
03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:28,040
That's right, doubters.

3666
03:04:28,300 --> 03:04:29,960
That's fucking right.

3667
03:04:30,400 --> 03:04:33,760
Doubters, an absolute shambles after today.

3668
03:04:35,960 --> 03:04:37,780
We were all here.

3669
03:04:38,220 --> 03:04:39,980
We were all here.

3670
03:04:40,500 --> 03:04:41,900
Oh my god.

3671
03:04:42,060 --> 03:04:43,120
Oh my god.

3672
03:04:43,880 --> 03:04:45,340
What a wild ride.

3673
03:04:45,500 --> 03:04:47,960
I crashed out several times today, but it's okay.

3674
03:04:48,040 --> 03:04:48,700
We did it.

3675
03:04:48,860 --> 03:04:51,880
We fucking did it.

3676
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:54,600
But...

3677
03:04:55,640 --> 03:04:57,280
But it doesn't mean...

3678
03:04:57,280 --> 03:04:58,980
It doesn't mean it's over.

3679
03:04:59,180 --> 03:05:02,040
Because we do have another stream tonight, guys.

3680
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:04,040
We do have another stream.

3681
03:05:05,140 --> 03:05:07,900
We have another stream in like two hours.

3682
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:11,440
So I'll be doing some Twitch Rivals practice after that.

3683
03:05:11,440 --> 03:05:13,020
But also, I did try to show something.

3684
03:05:13,240 --> 03:05:16,820
But if you guys want to get Oshie Sparks merch from the concert.

3685
03:05:17,180 --> 03:05:18,620
The Phantom Thief concert.

3686
03:05:18,960 --> 03:05:20,580
We are having pre-orders open.

3687
03:05:20,680 --> 03:05:22,420
And I believe it ends the end of January.

3688
03:05:22,880 --> 03:05:30,640
So if you want to order some of the stuff from the concert.

3689
03:05:30,780 --> 03:05:32,220
Even if you haven't been to the concert.

3690
03:05:33,040 --> 03:05:35,580
Please pre-order them for memory's sake.

3691
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:37,120
It was my very first concert.

3692
03:05:37,660 --> 03:05:38,820
Did I misspell it?

3693
03:05:39,800 --> 03:05:40,420
Did I?

3694
03:05:40,520 --> 03:05:40,660
No.

3695
03:05:40,880 --> 03:05:41,920
It fucking leads there.

3696
03:05:45,660 --> 03:05:46,540
Anyway, guys.

3697
03:05:46,680 --> 03:05:47,480
Also other stuff to show.

3698
03:05:47,580 --> 03:05:50,480
My Nendoroid, my gamer subcode, Fortnite code.

3699
03:05:50,620 --> 03:05:52,460
Miko Hatsune just came out on Fortnite.

3700
03:05:52,860 --> 03:05:54,580
So you should use my creator code.

3701
03:05:54,940 --> 03:05:58,680
It really just means that I get a little bit of the purchases.

3702
03:05:58,920 --> 03:06:00,340
From whatever you make on Fortnite.

3703
03:06:00,720 --> 03:06:02,480
It doesn't add any extra to your purchases.

3704
03:06:02,620 --> 03:06:03,700
I just get a little bit more.

3705
03:06:03,820 --> 03:06:06,800
I just get some from you supporting me.

3706
03:06:06,800 --> 03:06:10,160
Fortnite just gives me a little bit of the percentage.

3707
03:06:10,540 --> 03:06:11,560
From the skins you buy.

3708
03:06:11,800 --> 03:06:13,020
In the Fortnite store.

3709
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:14,580
So just use Doki Bird.

3710
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:17,280
If you are buying a Miko Hatsune skin on Fortnite.

3711
03:06:17,900 --> 03:06:19,580
Or any of the cosmetics.

3712
03:06:20,120 --> 03:06:20,660
Alright, guys.

3713
03:06:20,880 --> 03:06:24,180
My brain hurts from trying to piece...

3714
03:06:24,180 --> 03:06:24,900
My brain...

3715
03:06:24,900 --> 03:06:26,700
I'm not going to lie.

3716
03:06:27,460 --> 03:06:30,900
That was actually really stressful.

3717
03:06:31,540 --> 03:06:34,000
So my brain hurts a little.

3718
03:06:34,120 --> 03:06:36,780
Trying to piece everything together.

3719
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:40,600
So I'm going to...

3720
03:06:40,600 --> 03:06:42,260
I'm going to...

3721
03:06:42,260 --> 03:06:44,740
I'm going to rest a little bit.

3722
03:06:45,220 --> 03:06:46,940
Maybe we'll try again.

3723
03:06:47,380 --> 03:06:49,920
One day we'll finish the car again.

3724
03:06:50,460 --> 03:06:53,340
One day we'll do a glitchless run.

3725
03:06:53,500 --> 03:06:53,820
Chat.

3726
03:06:54,180 --> 03:06:55,480
A glitchless run.

3727
03:06:55,600 --> 03:06:57,640
Like we glitched our car into it.

3728
03:06:57,920 --> 03:07:00,260
But we will do a glitchless run in the future.

3729
03:07:00,340 --> 03:07:01,720
I promise you guys that.

3730
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:05,960
Anyway.

3731
03:07:06,520 --> 03:07:06,760
So I'm going to...

3732
03:07:06,760 --> 03:07:08,060
As always, everybody.

3733
03:07:08,500 --> 03:07:09,680
Stay hydrated.

3734
03:07:10,240 --> 03:07:10,840
Pause your chat.

3735
03:07:11,160 --> 03:07:12,000
Get up and move around.

3736
03:07:12,060 --> 03:07:13,100
And get that blood flowing.

3737
03:07:13,280 --> 03:07:14,260
And if you...

3738
03:07:14,260 --> 03:07:16,360
For me, head to bed.

3739
03:07:16,460 --> 03:07:17,780
Because you deserve it.

3740
03:07:17,860 --> 03:07:20,860
I'll see you guys on Twitch later.

3741
03:07:21,080 --> 03:07:21,780
Bye, everybody.

3742
03:07:22,080 --> 03:07:22,560
Bye.
