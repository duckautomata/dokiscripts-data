1
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,580
Hey guys!

2
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,900
Kumi here wants to say something for all of us.

3
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,540
You still don't believe me?

4
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,740
We're actually live you bitch!

5
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,580
You can't pull the same shit on me three times!

6
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,660
We're actually live!

7
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,640
I tried to pretend to be going live two times before.

8
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,320
And she didn't believe me.

9
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
And now that we're actually live...

10
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,420
Please!

11
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,100
Please!

12
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,520
Please!

13
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,940
Please!

14
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
Holy shit.

15
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,480
I fucking muted you instantly.

16
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,660
Hey you told me to beg.

17
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,280
You told me to beg.

18
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,120
Bro!

19
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,980
That's a little bit too much.

20
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,100
I told you to beg.

21
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,500
I told you to beg.

22
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,280
You told me to turn your sound guy.

23
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Oh my god.

24
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,800
That was... Sorry.

25
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,660
I did not realize I had to turn that way down.

26
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,880
You told me to beg.

27
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,520
And I said I was going to put my begging pants on.

28
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,240
And you were like, okay.

29
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,020
I'm like, okay.

30
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,140
Tell your sound guy.

31
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,620
And you're like, why?

32
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,620
I told you!

33
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,400
Oh my god.

34
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm so sorry everybody.

35
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,660
I did not realize.

36
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,100
How loud that loud was going to be.

37
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,560
And it was... It was loud.

38
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,880
This guy really...

39
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,860
Goomy really wants to be mod.

40
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,260
So I was like, just beg for it.

41
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,240
I was like, but not right now though.

42
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,560
Do it while we're streaming.

43
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,860
Do it for the whole world to see.

44
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,200
I am so sorry for everybody that went down there.

45
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,380
Hey sound dude.

46
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,820
What's up?

47
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,040
Alright guys.

48
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,260
Today is the day.

49
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,360
I can finally finalize this divorce.

50
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,640
And leave my bitch of a wife.

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,920
I get to leave my stupid asshole of a husband.

52
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,980
There's completely nothing in this house.

53
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,960
Wow.

54
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,040
I don't need your money.

55
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,240
You made me to be a trophy husband.

56
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,640
I...

57
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,020
Well you sure ain't a trophy.

58
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,940
I'll tell you that much.

59
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,460
Wow.

60
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,320
I know for sure that I'm a catch.

61
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,340
I'm a fucking catch.

62
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,080
Your mama?

63
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,400
You did.

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,880
You did when you married me.

65
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,920
Why would you marry a fucking farmer?

66
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,560
As an engineer.

67
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,200
Go into the plant.

68
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,200
Sometimes people lie.

69
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,760
Oh for like 10 plus years?

70
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,200
Like that child is like at least 10.

71
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,840
Go in.

72
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,480
I don't wanna.

73
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,160
Okay and we... this fucking stream will never end.

74
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:36,760
Hahaha.

75
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,360
Hahaha.

76
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,040
This feels so nasty.

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm so tired.

78
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,420
Okay.

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,280
Good.

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,740
Sorry I...

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,740
My... my hand slipped.

82
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,220
We did it.

83
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,960
Look at that.

84
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,020
Oh my god.

85
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,240
Wow you're so smart.

86
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,360
How did you know we had to do that?

87
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,280
You say something?

88
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,980
You have to do this thing over there.

89
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,400
You say something freak boy.

90
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,460
This is so not fair.

91
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,620
Why do you get to be DPS?

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,060
I'm like the support.

93
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,220
I'm the husband.

94
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,640
Oh that's better.

95
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,920
Why do you get to be DPS?

96
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,020
Hey ah.

97
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,520
No.

98
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,320
Wait what does that even do?

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,420
What does the water do?

100
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,760
Gumi.

101
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,380
Please.

102
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,760
Please for the love.

103
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,080
Oh you have to water the plants.

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,560
Go water the plants.

105
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
Go water the plants.

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,980
What plants?

107
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,680
In the fucking planter.

108
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,860
Where do you think...

109
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,340
I ALWAYS WATER THEM.

110
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,360
You just jump right into the pot.

111
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,160
Be one with your garden.

112
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,960
Yeah see you didn't fucking water them before.

113
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,040
They've been watered.

114
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,660
Wait how do I?

115
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,120
You're looking me go.

116
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,380
Yay.

117
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,940
Sorry.

118
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,900
Is that you?

119
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,500
I have to do all the work here.

120
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,580
Don't be.

121
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,220
Wait what?

122
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,220
You have to do this.

123
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,680
What the?

124
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,620
What?

125
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,420
Help me over.

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,800
Oh there it is.

127
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,080
Here I did it.

128
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,660
You're fucking welcome.

129
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,120
Look at me go.

130
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,810
Stay hydrated.

131
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,490
Even if you're getting in the forest.

132
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,310
Remember to stay hydrated.

133
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,290
Don't make me put on my begging pants again.

134
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,710
Down guy.

135
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,670
It's terrible.

136
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,550
That is what happens when you abandon your passion.

137
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,450
It gets infected.

138
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,830
Infected?

139
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,250
What?

140
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,550
Purple stuff is everywhere.

141
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,110
And it will keep spreading unless you stop.

142
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,050
I didn't get infected.

143
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,670
So Cody, will you nurture your passion?

144
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:57,910
Or will you start a new life?

145
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,690
What the fuck infected my garden?

146
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,130
No.

147
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,030
May, let's take this purple stuff out.

148
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,970
What the fuck?

149
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,230
Let's do it.

150
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,770
Why do I have to deal with it?

151
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,190
Because you're the wife.

152
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,330
Also give me.

153
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:10,830
I don't want that light.

154
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,430
Get this way.

155
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,410
Give me a sec.

156
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,550
I just need to make sure the sound is okay after I fucking had the swab.

157
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,550
Alright, here we go.

158
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,810
We're good.

159
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,470
Guys, I'm so quiet.

160
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,130
Guys.

161
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,050
No, no, no, no.

162
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,030
Don't believe her lies.

163
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,450
Don't believe her lies.

164
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,390
Do not believe her lies.

165
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,990
She's gonna go so loud later.

166
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,590
Don't believe her lies.

167
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,810
Oh, I got the DPS.

168
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,130
Look at that.

169
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,010
You wish you could do that.

170
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,690
Oh, it's we guys going for zombies.

171
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,530
She's lying.

172
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,750
She's the one that tempted me to marry her with that voice.

173
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,010
And then look at her now.

174
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,130
Look at her now.

175
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,610
They all change.

176
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,130
Can you like help me kill these guys?

177
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,730
What do you think I'm doing?

178
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,370
Oh, okay.

179
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:58,950
Good job.

180
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,750
What the fuck?

181
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,990
Well, that'll teach him to stay away from my guards.

182
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,310
Don't believe her lies.

183
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,490
Don't believe it.

184
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,750
It's a honey pie.

185
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,950
Don't believe her.

186
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,130
She's gonna take all your money like she took mine.

187
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,330
I didn't sign the freedom.

188
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,390
I'm the one that make money, doggy.

189
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,270
Wow, you're so pretty, Cody.

190
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,130
Broly's?

191
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,150
What the fuck?

192
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,110
I think I can help you across.

193
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,830
How do I?

194
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,610
Oh, I give you like a platform.

195
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,470
Is it here?

196
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,790
Come over here.

197
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,160
There you go.

198
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,680
Oh, I can't.

199
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,740
Oh, I can't.

200
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,080
What are you doing?

201
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,480
What are you doing?

202
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,220
And then...

203
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,740
There you go.

204
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,280
I don't think this is where we go.

205
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,040
No, I think this is as far as I can stretch!

206
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,180
You think it's that way?

207
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:02,660
I think I went the wrong way.

208
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,380
I don't know how I went the wrong way.

209
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,880
Guys, there is a possibility that I went the wrong way.

210
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,500
I don't know how.

211
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,260
Wow, but I think...

212
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,640
You're making these leaves so far!

213
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,340
What do you mean?

214
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,220
They're like perfectly... oh, how do I fucking get to you?

215
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,320
That's the furthest I can get to.

216
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,140
Oh, I can...

217
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,900
Hey, you know the piss flower?

218
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,360
The what flower?

219
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,960
The piss flower.

220
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,160
No, I do not.

221
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,880
No, no, gozo.

222
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,380
What the fuck is that?

223
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,560
Oh, I'm so thirsty.

224
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,560
Oh, you have to...

225
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,960
Oh, you're like watered... you got a watered pad!

226
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,580
It's the only thing!

227
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,860
I could fucking die!

228
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,140
Okay, now you have to go through the window.

229
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,120
Okay.

230
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,580
Now I go through the window.

231
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,760
Look at me go.

232
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,820
Here I am.

233
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Now you have to die.

234
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,180
You have to die.

235
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,240
You have to die and go through the window.

236
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,840
No, I don't have to die!

237
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,200
Look!

238
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,340
No, no, no!

239
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,260
You make a leave there?

240
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,420
I can't get there!

241
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,220
What do you mean?

242
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,380
You go through the window.

243
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,420
I can't.

244
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:15,740
I can't.

245
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,440
You go straight through the window.

246
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,100
You go straight through the window.

247
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,560
Okay, yeah, yeah.

248
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:17,880
And then what?

249
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,420
And then what?

250
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Huh?

251
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:18,980
And then what?

252
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,220
Make a leave!

253
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,380
Make a leave!

254
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,020
Oh...

255
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,960
I forgot I could do that.

256
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,360
Oh my god, you're so smart.

257
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,040
This is why we got married in the first place.

258
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,880
You just... you knew the answers that I don't.

259
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,820
Okay, water this plant.

260
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,340
Yeah!

261
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,800
Where do I go?

262
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,960
Oh, I need to reconnect the fish.

263
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,880
You gotta reconnect the what?

264
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,040
The fish.

265
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,040
The fish?

266
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
What the fuck is the fish?

267
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,200
We just have to chop it all up, right?

268
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,080
Well, I hope it's that simple.

269
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,400
Okay.

270
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm growing the leaves.

271
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,140
I'm growing the leaves.

272
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,460
There you go.

273
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,040
Is that much better, my queen?

274
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,320
Is that a better...

275
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,980
Here, leaf grow for you, queen.

276
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,600
So demanding.

277
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,020
Hi guys, I'm...

278
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,420
Volume check.

279
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,480
Fuck off.

280
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,520
What's this?

281
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,240
Okay, here we go.

282
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,080
How do I do this again?

283
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,660
I don't remember.

284
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,220
I'll pull it.

285
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,600
Pull it.

286
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,080
Pull.

287
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,440
And then...

288
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,620
Open up!

289
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,120
Whoa!

290
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,740
Oh my god!

291
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,500
In front of me?!

292
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,980
You're gonna do that in front of me?!

293
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,880
I knew it.

294
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,100
Dude, you want me to let him fucking die?!

295
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,720
Wait, am I a cuck?

296
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,440
What the fuck?

297
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:49,720
Did you see that?

298
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,080
Yes, what was it?

299
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,620
What the fuck is that?

300
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,760
It's a ball or something.

301
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,420
Oh, that's not a ball!

302
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,700
Oh, that is not a... yeah.

303
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,320
Time to wax some weeds, Cody!

304
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,500
Oh, wait, how do I fucking contribute?

305
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,460
Oh!

306
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,100
Oh!

307
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,220
Oh, oh, like this?

308
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,560
I'm holding on!

309
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,980
Hold it down!

310
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,620
Water it!

311
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,160
Water it!

312
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,500
Oh, okay, never mind.

313
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,200
I guess you have to beat him up.

314
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,300
Do something!

315
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,320
I can't attack!

316
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,240
I'm gonna attack!

317
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm gonna attack!

318
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:19,480
There's

319
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,700
creeps on me!

320
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,600
What can I do?!

321
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,080
I literally can't do anything!

322
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,920
Oh, I can attack.

323
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,680
By the way, I can also attack.

324
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,060
If you also wanna know.

325
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,320
I'm back.

326
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,640
I held it!

327
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,080
I held it with my fucking life!

328
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,700
Mine grows up.

329
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,620
Oh!

330
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,060
Oh, okay, that's on you.

331
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,380
I held it?

332
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,100
Oh, okay.

333
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,820
Just try to fucking...

334
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,840
Just dodge!

335
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,900
Why can't you just dodge?

336
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,940
There you go.

337
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,140
Look, I held him.

338
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,320
I'm holding him by the neck.

339
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm watching all happen in front of me.

340
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,620
See that?

341
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:06,980
See, look at that.

342
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,660
I dodged.

343
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,840
It's just that easy.

344
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,360
Just move to the left and the right.

345
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,740
Okay, let me know when you're in melee range.

346
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,000
Damn, we...

347
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,540
We did it!

348
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,660
We whipped them into shape, didn't we?

349
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,760
Where do we go now?

350
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,420
Oh, okay.

351
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,060
Good one.

352
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,380
Bro, I don't know how to tend a garden apparently.

353
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,540
Yeah, what the fuck have you been doing at home?

354
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:27,660
This garden fucking sucks.

355
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,060
I don't know.

356
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,660
Raising our daughter because somebody else wouldn't?

357
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,740
She's at school!

358
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,720
She's literally ten years old!

359
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,280
She's literally...

360
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,940
At home?

361
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,100
At home right now!

362
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,640
It's the weekend!

363
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,660
It's the weekend!

364
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,040
Oh, now you fucking realize what day it is.

365
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,680
Wow.

366
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,340
I can't believe it.

367
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,240
You don't even care.

368
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,640
You come home late at night at like 9pm every fucking day.

369
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,380
Well, I have to raise our daughter.

370
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,880
I have to raise...

371
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,240
What?

372
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,940
Jeremy?

373
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,120
Who's Jeremy?

374
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,240
Jeremy?

375
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,120
My boss.

376
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,140
Your boss?

377
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,360
No, I didn't.

378
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,360
Are you sure?

379
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,540
What about the first round?

380
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,520
I had to get a raise somehow.

381
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,760
Is this why you came home with a new car that night?

382
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,540
I thought you got a promotion!

383
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,900
Join?

384
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,920
I did get a promotion.

385
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,000
And a new car.

386
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,720
Well, that's...

387
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,300
What did you do for that promotion?

388
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,120
You know, I...

389
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,800
Well...

390
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,900
I just wanted to make sure that you didn't see that.

391
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,380
Oh, boy.

392
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,080
Oh, boy.

393
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,560
I need to run.

394
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,920
Sometimes... Okay, I feel like this game is giving the wrong message because it's teaching people that like...

395
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,280
You can fix a marriage even if they want to get a divorce.

396
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,500
Just let people get a divorce.

397
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,560
It should be normalized.

398
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,680
But like, if the marriage is already sort of like that bad...

399
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,780
I feel like if you're to the point where you're like this close to getting a divorce...

400
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,220
I don't think you should force yourself to make it work.

401
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,180
Oh, hey.

402
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,660
Here it is.

403
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,720
Jump further than me.

404
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,120
That's easy.

405
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,840
Alright, here we go.

406
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,960
How do I...

407
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,840
Weeeeee.

408
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,660
Weeeeee.

409
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,260
Dude, I used to be so fucking scared of this shit.

410
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:54,940
Weeeeee.

411
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,480
Wait, how do I let go?

412
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,980
What the fuck?

413
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,940
Oh, yes!

414
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,520
What the hell?

415
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,800
I was more patient than you for once in my life.

416
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,520
Wait, is that how momentum works?

417
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,640
Because I thought if you go all the way up...

418
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,060
Yeah, but I didn't go all the way like around.

419
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,600
So like I had more momentum going off because I got off.

420
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,580
Oh, my screen looked like it was all the way at the top.

421
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,120
Yeah, I had like... I didn't do it when I was like all the way up to the top.

422
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,160
I did like when it was just a little bit.

423
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,060
Also like someone super chatted.

424
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,940
Like that's what you get for marrying a woman with the name...

425
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,840
Ho at the end.

426
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:36,960
Holy...

427
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,060
Wait, what do you do?

428
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,800
Is that racially motivated?

429
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,480
What do you... what do you wanna... what do you wanna... no.

430
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,560
Is that racially motivated?

431
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,140
It's a Korean word.

432
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,260
Is that racially motivated?

433
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,360
Who's saying that?

434
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,080
Woooow.

435
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,180
Woooow.

436
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,380
Woooow.

437
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,400
Who's disrespecting it?

438
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:55,940
Woooow.

439
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,440
Anyway, I'm having a great time playing this game.

440
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,140
Anyway, this game has been really fun so far.

441
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,300
Woooow.

442
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
I'm having so much fun.

443
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,280
I'll turn this around anyway.

444
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,060
Woooow.

445
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,440
Water the fucking plants.

446
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,880
I'll turn this shit around.

447
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,880
Woooow.

448
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,580
Okay, I'm gonna jump on.

449
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,440
Hi guys.

450
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Welcome to It Takes Two where we're having a great time.

451
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,880
This game is so fun.

452
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,280
Woooow.

453
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,320
Oh my god, playing with a good friend here.

454
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,400
Woooow.

455
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,300
Nothing controversial.

456
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,320
Oh, so we're friends.

457
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,220
Woooow.

458
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,220
Oh, so we're friends.

459
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,280
Woooow.

460
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,200
Oh.

461
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,260
Okay.

462
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,780
What does this dragonfly do?

463
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,240
Is he just...

464
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,440
No.

465
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,160
He's just staring at us.

466
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,100
Oh, what the fuck?

467
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,460
Look at the graphics, man.

468
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,320
It's so good.

469
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,300
I know if you... Oh my god.

470
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,060
No wonder this game won game of the year, I think.

471
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,200
This game won... Did this game win game of the year?

472
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
What are you doing?

473
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,320
Yeah.

474
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,020
Wait, I need to drink water for this.

475
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
Okay, coming in.

476
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,040
Dude,

477
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,960
this reminds me of those carnival games.

478
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,140
Oh yeah, like the clown?

479
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
What the fuck is that?

480
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,960
That's a little spider.

481
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,000
What?

482
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,200
It's a... Wait, what the fuck?

483
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,240
That's not a... That's a sma... spider?

484
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,700
I need you to pull that shield.

485
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,300
That is not a... That can't be a spider.

486
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,860
We're wearing it down, man.

487
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,780
Keep it up.

488
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,200
That's a spider?

489
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,300
That's like a tree.

490
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,060
Okay, I've got...

491
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,480
Igumi.

492
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,660
Ignore him.

493
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,680
Think about the big guy.

494
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,240
Just run past him.

495
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,740
I can't.

496
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,260
It makes me auto-lock him.

497
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,900
Just fucking look past him.

498
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,240
There you go.

499
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,640
I did it.

500
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,940
Okay, it's fine.

501
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,020
I'll help you.

502
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,360
See, don't... Don't forget who helped you.

503
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,300
Easy.

504
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,580
Watch out, man.

505
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,300
More creatures.

506
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,200
Oh shit!

507
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,080
There you go.

508
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,560
I did it.

509
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,380
I pulled him.

510
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,800
Ignore the others.

511
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,500
They don't matter.

512
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,520
They're just babies.

513
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,300
Okay.

514
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,280
I'm holding on him.

515
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm holding on him.

516
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,920
Ignore the others.

517
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,640
What are you gonna do?

518
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,120
Kill you?

519
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,100
I like how...

520
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,300
I don't know.

521
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,160
Look at my health pool.

522
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,520
You're literally full HP.

523
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,520
You're literally full HP.

524
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,100
No!

525
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,180
You're fine.

526
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,240
See?

527
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,740
Look, they're little babies.

528
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,800
It's like squishing snails.

529
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,960
Which I would never do.

530
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,340
I would never do.

531
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
I have never done whatsoever in my life.

532
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,660
I just tell other people to do it for me.

533
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,780
Okay, what the fuck?

534
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,840
I don't give a shit about it.

535
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,080
Okay, so do you never like ever be like...

536
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,420
I've been to a very humid place.

537
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,100
And then like, after it rains or it's raining and all the snails come out.

538
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,340
Yeah.

539
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,860
Yeah.

540
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,240
It's not... It's like...

541
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,620
They're everywhere.

542
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,440
You can't just like not...

543
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,920
They're just in your way.

544
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,480
You know?

545
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,580
Like you can just accidentally step on them.

546
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,000
It's not like I did it on purpose.

547
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,540
And then because like the whole walkway...

548
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,660
Because I have to go to school.

549
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,160
The whole walkway is like filled with snails.

550
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,060
Like I need somebody to...

551
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,620
Like make a path for me.

552
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,220
Oh, this is such a cute Spidey.

553
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,060
No, that somebody was my dad.

554
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,380
He would like make a pathway for me to walk through.

555
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,460
Because the whole pathway was filled with snails.

556
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,880
But then you can hear the audible crunch too.

557
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,400
No!

558
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,460
What about you?

559
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,480
We'll find another one.

560
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,220
Come on.

561
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,370
You need a win.

562
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,030
Oh, good for you.

563
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,310
Can you help me get to the other side?

564
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,210
Yay!

565
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,190
Wait, what do I do?

566
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:23,830
What do I do?

567
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,210
What do I do?

568
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,890
Why do you left?

569
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,250
What?

570
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,750
That's what the web was for!

571
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,250
Hello?

572
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,650
Hello?

573
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,670
Are you gonna do anything?

574
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,550
Hello?

575
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,670
I don't know how to use it.

576
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,590
What do you mean you don't know how to use it?

577
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,610
Okay, figure out how to use it before I do anything.

578
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,550
Okay, what are you doing?

579
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,450
What is that?

580
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,810
What are you doing?

581
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,030
I don't know!

582
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,610
Okay, I'm flying!

583
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,290
Oh, are you?

584
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,350
Oh, okay.

585
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,750
Okay.

586
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,170
Do you know what to do now?

587
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,290
Why the fuck does he go hypers?

588
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,250
What the fuck?

589
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,290
Wait, wait.

590
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,990
What's going on?

591
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:06,750
Oh!

592
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,270
Nice.

593
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,230
Just keep filling it.

594
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,970
Just keep filling it.

595
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,910
Just keep filling it.

596
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,210
Alright, we're good.

597
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:15,750
I'm out.

598
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,450
I'm on the other side.

599
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,450
You can come back now.

600
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,930
Where do we go?

601
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,850
This way.

602
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,050
Why do he goes hypers?

603
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,390
No, hypers!

604
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,470
I found more.

605
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,970
Oh, it's another spider for me?

606
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,130
It's for me!

607
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,970
We get to ride our spiders together.

608
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,170
Oh my god!

609
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,790
They're a couple!

610
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,530
Get into force now before she takes everything.

611
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,350
Back that thing up.

612
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,610
Nice!

613
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,710
These spiders... I thought spiders don't have like husband and wives.

614
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,390
The female spider just eats the fucking male spider.

615
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:10,490
I thought like most insects just like eat the other one after they... after they bang.

616
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,210
Oh, it's even better!

617
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:12,970
Hey!

618
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,890
We do!

619
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,810
I like how somebody was like their siblings.

620
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,630
I mean, they're fucking bugs.

621
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,950
They don't care if they're...

622
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,170
I gotta hold on to my glasses!

623
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,410
Do they... do they care?

624
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,650
Don't like ants like...

625
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,630
Don't... wait, how did you do that?

626
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,050
How did you do that?

627
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,470
Oh!

628
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,070
I forgot how.

629
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,150
Okay, I figured it out.

630
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,610
I forgot the controls all of a sudden.

631
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,090
Where are we going?

632
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,110
Oh.

633
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,050
Wait for me!

634
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,530
I've never had a pet spider.

635
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,590
Wait for me!

636
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,770
I'm so fucking far!

637
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,350
Wait, where are you?

638
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,770
Oh my god, you're so ahead.

639
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,550
Hey, Spidey!

640
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,410
You doing alright down there?

641
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,430
Oh me please.

642
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,490
I'm so behind.

643
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,410
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

644
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,250
Oh me please.

645
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,390
I was a little slow.

646
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,330
Just for today.

647
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,090
I'll wait for you right here.

648
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,230
Oh, just because you have to.

649
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,170
You're forced to.

650
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,330
Hi, Furs!

651
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,430
Very strong spider.

652
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,970
How do I get off this?

653
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,930
Oh, I can do it while I'm on the spider.

654
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,370
Whoops.

655
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,890
Fill that up.

656
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:31,990
Glup, glup, glup.

657
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:32,910
I wish that were me.

658
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,550
Fill that up.

659
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,350
Glup, glup, glup.

660
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,470
What?

661
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,070
What?

662
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,970
Fill that up.

663
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,690
I wish Rose was here to see this.

664
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,230
I don't think Rose would want to.

665
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:46,510
Yeah.

666
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,670
Let's just give her more trauma, you know?

667
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,930
That's what a kid would want.

668
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,590
More trauma.

669
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,070
Yay!

670
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,550
Where the fuck is the end for this?

671
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,210
Is there an end?

672
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:01,830
I don't think so.

673
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,210
I think we were supposed to go up top.

674
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:04,770
Right?

675
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,710
Yeah.

676
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,630
Yeah, we were.

677
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:24,970
I'm surprised, like, do we even have any friends outside of just us two?

678
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,290
You asked this last time too.

679
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,730
I don't know.

680
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:29,730
Hahaha.

681
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:37,190
I'm just assuming, like, wouldn't somebody visit us and be like, hey guys.

682
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,310
What the fuck?

683
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,790
What kind of fucked up plants are you growing?

684
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,450
Look, I need somebody to give me attention.

685
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,250
You see that thing on the left?

686
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,650
Hey, I'm giving you context clues.

687
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,290
You see that thing?

688
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,310
What thing?

689
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,390
That thing?

690
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,250
Right there?

691
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,170
Oh!

692
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,750
Okay, I almost walked the wrong way.

693
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,130
Don't worry, I got this.

694
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,110
Boom!

695
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,870
I missed.

696
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,750
But don't worry, I didn't miss this time.

697
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,660
Mr. Salmon.

698
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,280
Give me a dream.

699
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,160
Bum bum bum.

700
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,600
May you remember, that I've ever seen.

701
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,560
Bum bum bum.

702
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,220
This is our brain on spiders.

703
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,980
Wait, where do we... oh, this way.

704
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,560
Wait, what?

705
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,400
Yeah, I need you to do something.

706
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,500
You can wash this off.

707
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:37,920
Oh!

708
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,600
My spider disintegrated!

709
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,020
What?

710
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,460
What kind of fucking gunk is this?

711
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,800
My spider got fucking Thanos snapped.

712
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,340
It's pesticides.

713
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,040
Are these pesticides?

714
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,620
There's no way.

715
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,620
Why would I just spray it on a fucking tree?

716
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,000
Like...

717
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,180
Of all things.

718
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,180
Oh, the gamer... what the fuck is a gamer gunk?

719
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,900
Oh, you're stuck?

720
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:05,800
Oh, you're stuck?

721
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:05,860
Oh, right.

722
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,260
Uh, let's see.

723
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,600
How do I save you?

724
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,520
How the fuck... oh, here.

725
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,280
Okay.

726
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,480
Please!

727
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,780
Okay, I got it.

728
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,740
I think you have to... you have to jump.

729
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,700
Right?

730
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,240
I can't jump.

731
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,540
Wait, then what do you do?

732
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,400
You jump on this?

733
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,520
You jump on that?

734
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,700
Yeah.

735
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,620
And then you...

736
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,020
There we go.

737
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,160
Oh, I'm stuck.

738
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,640
And then you head over this way.

739
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,140
It's that easy.

740
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,660
Thank you for the ride again, spider.

741
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,340
Thank you, spider.

742
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,180
I'm gonna make sure we don't squish you when we're back to normal size, people.

743
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,000
This was me when I was like nine.

744
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,440
I used to be like... I don't know why, but I woke up in the middle of the night so thirsty for water.

745
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,220
You know how like...

746
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,800
Yeah?

747
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,460
Most Asian households have those kettles full of water?

748
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

749
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,060
I like used four... three to four cups.

750
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,880
Oh, that's the mama.

751
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,640
Oh my god.

752
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
So they weren't boyfriend girlfriend.

753
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,600
Didn't your chat tell you that?

754
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,620
Yeah, but like, do you really believe 100% what chat tells you?

755
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,380
If they played the game before, I would hope so.

756
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,080
Oh, I told you!

757
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,260
See, they have no fucking husband.

758
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,780
The spider killed the husband.

759
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,580
Meow.

760
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
I told you!

761
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,220
I didn't get to foreshadowing about what's about to happen.

762
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,820
Well, technically, I'm like the house husband, so wouldn't it be the other...

763
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,760
No.

764
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,700
That's not fair.

765
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,560
What the fuck?

766
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,580
I do so much around...

767
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,060
Who's gonna fucking do your laundry?

768
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,760
You don't know how to do your laundry.

769
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,040
What the fuck?

770
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,200
Whatever they are, we need to take them out.

771
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:58,880
Okay.

772
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,160
Here comes...

773
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,460
I got it.

774
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,840
How did you die?

775
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,820
What the fuck?

776
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,420
You, you like pulled it down right on top my head!

777
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,500
Whoopsie.

778
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,080
Me?

779
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,080
How was I supposed to know that?

780
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,500
Ahh!

781
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,820
Sorry, I fell.

782
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,540
Okay.

783
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:18,820
Okay.

784
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,620
Alright, I pulled him down, I pulled him down.

785
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
I pulled him down!

786
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,380
That works?

787
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,960
What, I accidentally pulled...

788
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,200
Okay.

789
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,600
There, I pulled him down!

790
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,140
I pulled him down!

791
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:30,740
Hurry up!

792
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,360
I'm gonna take this!

793
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,700
Okay, we're gonna get rid of all these real fast.

794
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,220
Alright, your turn.

795
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
I pulled him down.

796
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,580
Pulling him down again.

797
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,480
I'm slapping him with my fucking head whip.

798
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,660
There you go.

799
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,200
Yay!

800
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,140
It was that easy.

801
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,960
Oh man, these guys can't... Oh my god, who are these... why are they doing here?

802
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,120
I'm pretty sure like the book grew these too.

803
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,380
The plants are way out!

804
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,940
Hold them up, Koji!

805
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,640
Got it!

806
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,210
Ewwwww!

807
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:11,930
Ewwwww!

808
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,450
Oh god!

809
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,310
Bro!

810
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,330
You know what?

811
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,950
You're right for asking a divorce.

812
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,410
You're...

813
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,450
Maybe like a divorce was a good idea.

814
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,150
I have to reload?

815
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,250
I'm a plant!

816
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,350
What am I wrong?

817
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,030
I'm reloading!

818
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,290
It's part of my body!

819
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,290
Get away from me, Koji!

820
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,050
I don't wanna be pricked in the back!

821
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,570
It's literally part of my body!

822
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,410
Oh my god, please.

823
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,870
Fucking spray faster.

824
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,130
Are we done?

825
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,710
Go go go go go go go!

826
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,230
Eh, there's a cutscene, man!

827
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,030
What do you mean?

828
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,190
I couldn't go.

829
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,570
I had to watch the plants grow!

830
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,330
Look, my life is clear.

831
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:56,990
Me first.

832
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,430
What the fuck?

833
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,870
Where do you go from... Oh, here!

834
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,350
Here.

835
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,050
We have to beat this shit up.

836
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,170
Yeah, beat that plant up.

837
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:11,530
God.

838
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,130
Eww!

839
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:13,910
What?

840
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,210
Woah!

841
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,200
Yeah, I was gonna say, is this my garden?

842
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,760
Yeah!

843
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,000
What am I doing in this garden?

844
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,380
Anyways, um, I used like three to four cups.

845
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,060
And then I was just so thirsty that I drank straight from the kettle.

846
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,880
Wait, wouldn't it... wouldn't that be like extra hot?

847
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,840
Or like, did you guys keep it in?

848
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,960
No no no, we have a cold one and a hot one.

849
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,580
Oh!

850
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,880
So you... I mean, less waste of...

851
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,160
Because my grandma...

852
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,860
You don't have to do... Yeah, you don't have to do more dishwashing.

853
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,540
Is that better?

854
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Yeah, my grandma used to boil water in the morning and put it in a cold pot.

855
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,380
Yeah, that's smart.

856
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,080
Yeah, why would that be gross if you're all sharing in the family?

857
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,480
Eww!

858
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,960
Oh, that's a... that's a corpse!

859
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,960
No, it's a skin, you know like bug shed?

860
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,500
I think it's dead, Cody.

861
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,080
Oh no, it's dead.

862
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,400
Okay.

863
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,300
It's a corpse.

864
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,680
Shells!

865
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,240
They get so noisy!

866
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,520
No, it's like shedding.

867
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,800
It's shedding its skin.

868
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,920
It's a molt.

869
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,080
But yeah, um... I got pneumonia.

870
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,480
Oh, no!

871
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,640
You got pneumonia?

872
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,120
Who gave you pneumonia?

873
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,440
I got rid of them.

874
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,140
Clearly.

875
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,120
Or something like that.

876
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,260
I didn't... I drink... I was chugging water too much and I don't know why I was so thirsty but I got sick.

877
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,040
If we wait...

878
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,580
Wait!

879
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,800
I didn't like... water...

880
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,220
Who the f...

881
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,760
Water went down the wrong hole or something.

882
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,220
I don't think that's how... There's no way you can get pneumonia from just drinking water.

883
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,200
I think I also just got pneumonia somehow.

884
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,820
There's no way.

885
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,840
Oh, this is like... Okay, but what's the worst shit can happen?

886
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,480
We wake him up.

887
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,240
Watch this.

888
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,320
What the f... is wrong with you?

889
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,600
What is wrong?

890
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,020
Did you... Did you watch it?

891
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,860
Yeah, but... But did you watch it though?

892
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,100
I need to know if you saw what I did.

893
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,700
Do you want me to show it to you again?

894
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,380
Yeah.

895
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,460
They're actually quite cute.

896
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,240
Oh my god.

897
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,440
Did you see those teeth and claws?

898
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,920
They are kind of cute.

899
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

900
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,360
Who did you wake up?

901
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,160
What did you f... Why did you do that?

902
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,980
I didn't do nothing.

903
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,440
You know you could've went up?

904
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,300
Why did you go down?

905
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,000
I didn't want to go to the same place as you.

906
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,160
There's up!

907
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,140
I feel like we're invading their privacy.

908
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,380
Agreed.

909
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,100
Let's get out of here ASAP.

910
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,140
Oh my god.

911
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,480
Down?

912
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,980
Isn't like down harder?

913
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,140
I don't know.

914
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,820
I'm already through.

915
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah, because of all the noise you were making, I had to f... wait until...

916
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,480
I didn't make noise.

917
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,340
Okay, yeah.

918
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,580
You didn't make any noise.

919
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah.

920
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,500
Oh hey, look at all these ants.

921
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,380
Oh my god, these ants are so small.

922
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,280
Why do you have so much like motor oil over here?

923
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,020
I've seen like 50 jugs already.

924
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,240
Motor oil?

925
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,200
Where's the motor oil?

926
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,080
Oh my god, what am I doing while this...

927
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,560
No, there's... that's a wood sealer.

928
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,640
No, to the left!

929
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,380
That's one bucket of motor oil.

930
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,460
I've seen more.

931
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,920
One bucket of motor oil is not that many.

932
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,760
I've literally seen more.

933
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,560
Look, you don't know... it's okay, Gumi.

934
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,120
I know you don't know much about cars, but...

935
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,700
Oh.

936
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,520
But that... am I f... weed now?

937
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,040
Wow, look at you.

938
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,940
You look so soft.

939
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,700
Oh, you go...

940
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,420
Where are you going?

941
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,480
Where are you going?

942
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,020
Why are you not following me?

943
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,540
I am!

944
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,020
You're just going too fast!

945
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,980
You're the one who isn't a sneaky bush.

946
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,220
Here you go.

947
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,180
You ready?

948
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,480
Come on, I'm going... oh my god, I am going as slow as I possibly...

949
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:20,860
I'm crouching!

950
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,440
Why are you crouching?

951
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,100
Just fucking run!

952
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,560
It automatically makes me crouch!

953
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,460
That sounds like a skill issue right there.

954
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,880
What the fuck?

955
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,980
No one is forcing you to crouch.

956
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,680
Oh my god, I have to piss on it.

957
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,840
Keep moving and deal with it.

958
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,880
Aim carefully.

959
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,120
Yeah, deal with it.

960
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,760
Oh, stop, stop!

961
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,750
Oh shit, that's a big boy.

962
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,790
Stop!

963
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,290
Stop!

964
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:01,460
I see you fucking jump up there because you don't trust me.

965
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,460
You don't fucking trust me.

966
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,340
I can't believe...

967
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,700
What the... that was you.

968
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,320
That was you.

969
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,280
I was like perfectly in a quiet area.

970
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,880
I thought you were going to move.

971
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,840
You're right.

972
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,980
I don't trust you.

973
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,640
See, you don't even trust your own husband.

974
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,440
You'll need me.

975
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,020
I'm just going to leave.

976
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,360
Look at these.

977
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,600
These are my new friends.

978
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,080
The moles.

979
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,100
Oh my god, do you see that?

980
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,860
See what?

981
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,900
Oh my god, what the fuck?

982
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,580
That's so creepy.

983
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,500
Holy shit.

984
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,320
Wait, grab onto that.

985
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,060
Here we go.

986
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,200
Land on me.

987
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,940
I can't believe you wouldn't trust me.

988
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,080
I don't know why.

989
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,200
Hey guys!

990
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,300
Okay, five, four, three, two, one.

991
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,320
Okay, I see you.

992
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,800
I'm switching it.

993
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,580
Hi everyone!

994
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,340
What?

995
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,080
And I did swap.

996
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,740
What do you mean?

997
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,760
I did swap.

998
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,440
I did swap.

999
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,320
Wait, that one.

1000
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,020
Look at that one.

1001
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,360
Oh my god, it's an albino.

1002
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:14,860
That's an...

1003
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,840
What the fuck?

1004
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,040
Why would you move?

1005
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,320
Why would you move?

1006
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,040
It's an albino.

1007
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
What is it going to do?

1008
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,160
Breathe on you?

1009
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,080
Why are you so paranoid?

1010
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,840
Why are there so many?

1011
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,640
Because they like to bang.

1012
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,100
Oh yeah, they like to bang.

1013
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,300
They like to bang.

1014
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,100
I'm sorry for this one guy that just likes to fucking do his shit.

1015
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,020
They're rodents!

1016
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,080
Have you heard about that?

1017
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:41,980
Have you ever...

1018
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,320
Do you know about this mouse?

1019
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,280
That like...

1020
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:53,340
There's a type of mouse species for the guy whose whole purpose is to just like fuck until it dies from a heart attack.

1021
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,460
Wait, you never...

1022
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,160
Okay, there's a...

1023
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,240
I saw this on National Geographic.

1024
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,280
They were talking about the...

1025
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,580
They were talking about this rat species that would literally just bang until it gets a heart attack.

1026
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,980
It dies.

1027
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340
It's educational.

1028
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,100
No, that's not all mice.

1029
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,960
Some mice have their strength and know when to stop.

1030
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,760
There's this particular species...

1031
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,320
I know, it's going to make us go down.

1032
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,500
There's a particular species that doesn't know how to stop for the guys.

1033
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,760
And they just do it until they get a heart attack.

1034
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,360
I think...

1035
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,260
I think we have to run.

1036
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,060
Oh, shit.

1037
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,180
It's Crash Bandicoot time.

1038
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,840
It's educational.

1039
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,640
I'm...

1040
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,800
How did you die?

1041
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,000
No, I can just let you do all of this.

1042
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,820
How did you die?

1043
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,980
Because I'm here to let you do everything.

1044
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,600
Oh, no.

1045
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,280
No, I actually have to play the game.

1046
00:39:59,380 --> 00:39:59,860
Ow.

1047
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:00,900
See?

1048
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,480
What?

1049
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,260
Why do you die?

1050
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,160
Why do you keep jumping?

1051
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,120
No, it forces you to play.

1052
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,380
I'm not even pressing anything and it forces you to play.

1053
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,460
That's so fucked up.

1054
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,320
I can't believe it.

1055
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,560
It's not a choice.

1056
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,420
It's okay.

1057
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,320
Why is your way faster?

1058
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:22,960
It's not fair.

1059
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,780
Oh, don't worry.

1060
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,540
We're gaming.

1061
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,900
I'm ahead.

1062
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,460
I'm ahead.

1063
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,260
I'm ahead.

1064
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,720
What have we ever done to these moles?

1065
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:35,940
Why are these...

1066
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,440
Why do you only want to kill us off?

1067
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,500
I literally provide them food.

1068
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,780
You didn't take care of your garden.

1069
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,180
I literally provide them free food with my garden.

1070
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,120
It's rotting!

1071
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,560
Did you see it be rotting?

1072
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:45,600
No, no, no.

1073
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,420
That's not my fault.

1074
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:46,940
It's the book's fault.

1075
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,000
That's not my fault.

1076
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,900
The book caused this.

1077
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,540
Oh, man.

1078
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,880
I thought he was going to get us.

1079
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,460
Are you...

1080
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,560
Oh.

1081
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,040
Oh.

1082
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,560
Maybe he wants to say hi.

1083
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,240
Oh, no.

1084
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:02,600
It's not my fault.

1085
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,080
Oh my god.

1086
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,160
Oh my god!

1087
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:04,500
Oh my god!

1088
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,980
What the fuck?

1089
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,800
That poor mole!

1090
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,740
No!

1091
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,400
No!

1092
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,080
Haiyaa!

1093
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,360
Of these moles!

1094
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,140
Oh my god!

1095
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,400
Oh my god!

1096
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,380
We're monsters!

1097
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,560
Oh my god!

1098
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,700
Are we bad people?

1099
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,480
Oh.

1100
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,600
Oh!

1101
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,460
It's okay.

1102
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,160
He's still breathing.

1103
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,220
He's still breathing.

1104
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,320
That's not him.

1105
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:25,860
Oh.

1106
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,060
That's not him.

1107
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,580
Good luck.

1108
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,320
I believe in you.

1109
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,120
Oh, look.

1110
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,220
He got me!

1111
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,900
See, look, everything is fine.

1112
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,120
Oh my god, it's just like Little Nightmares.

1113
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,160
Oh my god, the gnome.

1114
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,200
What is up with me and gnomes?

1115
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,480
Wait, there's a treasure!

1116
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,880
Guys, we have to go back here when I'm bigger.

1117
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,800
Oh my god.

1118
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,340
I won't need your money anymore.

1119
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,910
Wait, what?

1120
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,790
Goodbye.

1121
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,440
There's more?

1122
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,320
Holy shit!

1123
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,820
What kind of fucking family is this?

1124
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,880
There has to be incest involved.

1125
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,960
Stop fishing!

1126
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,540
The toads!

1127
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:38,860
Woah, what?

1128
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,620
They can talk?

1129
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,420
Taxi!

1130
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,440
We're going to the greenhouse.

1131
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,260
Nah, we don't go there.

1132
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,280
Bad neighborhood, huh?

1133
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,940
Nah, they have no culture.

1134
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,860
Bad neighborhood.

1135
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,360
The crap has destroyed everything.

1136
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,000
Far as we go is the garden fountain.

1137
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,500
How much?

1138
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,100
Fis price a prontus.

1139
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,460
We love they eat you.

1140
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,220
We love they eat you.

1141
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,820
Where the fuck did I found that?

1142
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,060
God, that is disgusting.

1143
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,440
Hey, hold it, big boy.

1144
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,720
My back is killing me today.

1145
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,060
Hey, you take the fat one.

1146
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,020
That's my wife!

1147
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:16,580
What?

1148
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,500
What?

1149
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,660
Come on, you little gay boy!

1150
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,540
Hey, you, come on!

1151
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:23,980
Over here!

1152
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,700
Come on!

1153
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,500
Oh, sorry.

1154
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,480
Namaste.

1155
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,920
Oh my god, you made me look sad.

1156
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,000
Namaste.

1157
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,380
Woah!

1158
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,000
Oh my gosh, where am I though?

1159
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,220
Okay.

1160
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,380
Look!

1161
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,260
It's more motor oil down there!

1162
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,840
No, I, what do you mean?

1163
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,620
That's not, that's, that's called, uh...

1164
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,160
That's like the wood thinner.

1165
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,860
Look at that crap of crap everywhere!

1166
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,320
It ruins the, uh, atmosphere!

1167
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,300
You know what I'm saying?

1168
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,920
Why are they like, New York?

1169
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,880
But we're here to find the source and clean it up!

1170
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,640
Well, one of them is French.

1171
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,760
You have such a big gullet.

1172
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,860
You have no taste.

1173
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,440
You American people.

1174
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,260
Oh my god!

1175
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,220
Wait, isn't this frog American?

1176
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,880
No, that one's French!

1177
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,440
Yeah, but he's in America!

1178
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,500
There's no way he was...

1179
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,500
That doesn't make him American!

1180
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,100
There's no way this tadpole was born in France!

1181
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,480
There's no way!

1182
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,400
They do not live long enough to travel from France to America.

1183
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:26,820
Are you okay?

1184
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,340
Frog?

1185
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,360
I have a strong...

1186
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,740
What are you?

1187
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,580
I'm gonna try that downward frog one day.

1188
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,760
Sorry, I had like a war flashback.

1189
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,580
What happened?

1190
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,140
Thanks for the ride!

1191
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,280
I'm gonna go from here.

1192
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,480
How you doing back there?

1193
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,680
Good, thank you!

1194
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,880
Oh my god, it's like Frogger!

1195
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,860
Oh!

1196
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,120
Don't get into the gunk!

1197
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,360
You're gonna disintegrate.

1198
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,480
I need you and your frog!

1199
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,360
Oh, what?

1200
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,060
Oh, I actually need you for this guy!

1201
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,200
Okay, you go to the right.

1202
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,720
And then I'll push a button.

1203
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,620
Yeah, and then I'll push this button.

1204
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,860
And then you go to that one.

1205
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,420
And then you go to that one.

1206
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,180
See?

1207
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:17,920
Teamwork!

1208
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,360
And then you push that.

1209
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,570
Look at that!

1210
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,150
Frogs can work together.

1211
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:29,750
Well done!

1212
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,110
That was close!

1213
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,490
Oh my god, look!

1214
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,450
A little frog statue!

1215
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:33,930
Oh!

1216
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,890
I have a weird obsession with frogs apparently.

1217
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,710
God, I'm perfect!

1218
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,230
No wonder you married this man.

1219
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,050
Did I have like a weird thing?

1220
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:45,430
Yeah!

1221
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:46,670
About frogs.

1222
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:47,090
Why?

1223
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,230
Because um...

1224
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,290
Okay, you need to be here.

1225
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,710
Sorry, I saw a platform and I instantly jumped.

1226
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,190
We have to...

1227
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,170
Oh, we have to get out.

1228
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,950
By the way, don't open it while you're under the thing.

1229
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,590
You have to find a way past it.

1230
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:04,810
You have to go under that.

1231
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:06,790
Oh!

1232
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,530
Don't worry, you got this.

1233
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,470
I believe in you.

1234
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:16,890
Anyways, when I was younger, you know those Chinese supermarkets that like...

1235
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,350
you just order like fresh fish or some shit?

1236
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:21,750
Yeah.

1237
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,550
Okay, do I get in the frog?

1238
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,490
I do.

1239
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,930
Yeah, yeah, keep doing that.

1240
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,710
Okay, keep going with your story.

1241
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,810
Hold on, let me get to the other one.

1242
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,070
Um...

1243
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:36,690
I went with my grandma.

1244
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:38,970
And...

1245
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:44,190
She ordered a frog and I watched it get skinned right before my eyes when I was like 8 years old.

1246
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,170
Oh, wait, was it an Asian supermarket?

1247
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:46,790
Yeah.

1248
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,030
That's why I said...

1249
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:48,350
Yeah.

1250
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,830
But yeah, it like picked me up so much that she gets skinned.

1251
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,630
Yeah, they get hardcore sometimes.

1252
00:46:59,090 --> 00:46:59,530
Nice.

1253
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,010
Wait, how do I get you across?

1254
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,690
How do I get you across though?

1255
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,310
I'm already over.

1256
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,690
But I don't know how to get you over.

1257
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,880
Can you like...

1258
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,180
How are you supposed to come over here?

1259
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,380
Oh, I went backwards!

1260
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,800
You have to do this.

1261
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,220
I jumped the wrong way.

1262
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,560
It's okay.

1263
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,280
I don't know what to do now.

1264
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,180
Gooby, why didn't you say anything?

1265
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,940
I'm like...

1266
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,760
I'm like...

1267
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,560
I wasn't watching your screen.

1268
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,980
I was looking at my screen.

1269
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,160
Why weren't you waiting?

1270
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,580
I timed it!

1271
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,160
You... Okay, that's not me.

1272
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,280
That's not me.

1273
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,000
I had it perfectly... You went backwards in the first place!

1274
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,300
I timed it perfectly, okay?

1275
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,920
I timed it perfectly to your rhythm.

1276
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,880
And then suddenly your rhythm stopped.

1277
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,040
How was I supposed to know the rhythm will just disappear?

1278
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,900
Huh?

1279
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,140
I was like like right now!

1280
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,400
Like right now!

1281
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,560
I'm shooting it!

1282
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,240
Wait, what?

1283
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,400
Wait, what?

1284
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,920
Was I not supposed to jump that one?

1285
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,880
Okay, here we go.

1286
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,420
Alright.

1287
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,180
See?

1288
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,280
Look at this rhythm that you have established.

1289
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,380
And then suddenly it's just gone?

1290
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,380
Yeah, and then?

1291
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,720
I'm just making sure.

1292
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,300
And then look!

1293
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:37,800
Look!

1294
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,400
I have to wait an extra like five seconds!

1295
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,480
You can get off now.

1296
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:44,920
Oh!

1297
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,300
That's it?

1298
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,480
Okay.

1299
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,860
I got you.

1300
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,400
How did you get up here?

1301
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,480
Nice job!

1302
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,080
Thank you, frog!

1303
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,820
Alright, here you go.

1304
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,660
Go beat that shit up.

1305
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,780
Look at Kata here.

1306
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,560
Well, maybe they are French Canadian.

1307
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,700
Wait, I actually need to use the bathroom.

1308
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,620
I'll be right back real quick.

1309
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,240
Oh my god.

1310
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,100
Don't say anything weird to my chat.

1311
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,680
I'm gonna say anything weird.

1312
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,400
Anyways, um...

1313
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:24,940
Chad?

1314
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,200
Um...

1315
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,300
Can I tell you guys a story?

1316
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:32,720
Um...

1317
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,060
Oh!

1318
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:35,500
Dude!

1319
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,680
I love this story, but...

1320
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,560
I was playing Truth or Dare with another kid back in elementary school.

1321
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,120
Actually, it was a group of four.

1322
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,800
I'm not gonna say their names, but there was...

1323
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,400
a kid who...

1324
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,960
um... they...

1325
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,400
I don't know why they decided to tell us this, but we were like, Okay, Truth, what is the grossest thing you've done?

1326
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,600
And then...

1327
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,120
they were like, oh...

1328
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,780
I would pee.

1329
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,400
So, like...

1330
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,440
I would... I...

1331
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,100
We had mice in our house.

1332
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,980
And they were like...

1333
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,520
They would pee.

1334
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,100
On their floor.

1335
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,660
And leave crackers.

1336
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,660
On their floor.

1337
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,340
Because they were like, oh, the mice are thirsty!

1338
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,040
And they're probably hungry.

1339
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,650
And then we were like, dude, that is not normal.

1340
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,970
That's not normal.

1341
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,530
And they were like, oh yeah, my... my dad yelled at me for it.

1342
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:47,490
I'm like, yeah!

1343
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,570
I would think so!

1344
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,810
Anyways, I told my about it.

1345
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,010
And she's like, Gumi, I hope you never...

1346
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:58,530
talk to that kid ever again.

1347
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,030
Anyways...

1348
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,930
That's a story that I love telling.

1349
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,430
It's like pee pee for the mice.

1350
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,090
Hmm, my rat's thirsty.

1351
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,230
Let me pee on carpet.

1352
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:23,750
Yeah...

1353
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,050
Right, Doki?

1354
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:29,570
Why aren't you talking?

1355
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:30,830
Did you say to my chat?

1356
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:31,470
What?

1357
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:31,590
What?

1358
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,510
Did you say something weird to my chat?

1359
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:41,350
No, the plot twist is that... Why are people in my chat being like, Doki, please never leave...

1360
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,450
leave us alone with Gumi again?

1361
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,990
What did you say to them?

1362
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,210
I didn't say anything!

1363
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,230
I told them a story from my past!

1364
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:50,410
Bro, okay.

1365
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:51,810
Okay, that explains everything.

1366
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:00,410
Some of the shit that happened to you when you were younger...

1367
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,730
I understand why you're like this.

1368
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,050
That wasn't me!

1369
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,770
Oh my god, no, there was another...

1370
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,210
So, do you know what that same...

1371
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,150
Shoot or Dare?

1372
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:09,890
Hold on.

1373
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,450
That same Shoot or Dare...

1374
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,430
Oh, there's a game!

1375
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:12,850
There's a game!

1376
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:13,730
There's a snail race!

1377
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:14,910
Get over here.

1378
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:15,250
There's a Shoot or Dare?

1379
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:16,270
Um...

1380
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,470
We're playing Shoot or Dare and then...

1381
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:23,130
You know how like kids back then were like, I see London, I see France, I can see your underpants?

1382
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:24,410
Yes...

1383
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:27,070
Um...

1384
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:28,870
Basically... I don't need to rule enough for this.

1385
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:33,290
We were like, we dare you to show your underpants and then the kids...

1386
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:33,290
What?

1387
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:34,570
Yeah!

1388
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:35,930
Like as an embarrassment!

1389
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,530
What does that even mean?

1390
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,590
What do you mean?

1391
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,690
Like, as a what?

1392
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,170
Get away from me!

1393
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:47,570
No.

1394
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,850
Wait, which one's me?

1395
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,270
Oh, that's me.

1396
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,210
Okay, I lost track of who I am.

1397
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,010
I don't know.

1398
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,030
I think you're like... Show your underpants!

1399
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:57,690
What?

1400
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,810
And then... This kid not only... How old were you guys?

1401
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,490
We're like eight!

1402
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,950
And you thought that was okay?

1403
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,330
No!

1404
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,250
We thought it was embarrassing!

1405
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:09,890
We're like...

1406
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,990
Show your underpants!

1407
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,250
Like, pants yourself!

1408
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,290
Yeah!

1409
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:16,970
Slimey later!

1410
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,650
We'll credit you to your style!

1411
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,530
And then... No!

1412
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,810
This kid decided to like...

1413
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:29,550
take off his pants and his underpants and pee on the like, playground floor in front of us.

1414
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,790
And then we got a...

1415
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,050
The dean... Like, a teacher saw it!

1416
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,530
And then the dean got mad!

1417
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:35,930
I mean, Ed!

1418
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:38,370
Of course people would you... No!

1419
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:38,830
Of course!

1420
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:39,370
I know!

1421
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,650
We didn't ask him to fucking pee on the floor!

1422
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:42,970
He just did!

1423
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,490
And then the teacher got mad!

1424
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,050
Like, I mean...

1425
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,730
Anybody would be mad!

1426
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,970
Like, they'd be like... Oh my god!

1427
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,790
What is going on?

1428
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,170
Anyways...

1429
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,190
And...

1430
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,290
I'll never forgive this bitch!

1431
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,750
The other kid who was playing with us?

1432
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,010
She said it was my fault!

1433
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,470
But I didn't dare him to do that!

1434
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:10,370
Oh my god!

1435
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,710
That could've been a fucking lawsuit!

1436
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:13,850
Right there!

1437
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,890
Get the fucking plants watered!

1438
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:21,450
Red!

1439
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:21,890
Blue!

1440
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:22,410
Blue!

1441
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,310
Okay, I'm good.

1442
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:23,630
I'm good.

1443
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:23,930
I'm good.

1444
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:24,990
Anyways...

1445
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,570
Mom, pick me up!

1446
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:26,770
That happened to me!

1447
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:27,290
I'm scared!

1448
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,470
That was the same truth or dare...

1449
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:31,810
game.

1450
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:33,470
Alright!

1451
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,230
You made it!

1452
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,170
The same what?

1453
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,790
What did you tell them earlier?

1454
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,140
Huh?

1455
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:42,640
Huh?

1456
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,600
Kumi, stop cooking!

1457
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,680
Turn off the stove!

1458
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,600
Thank you for the super chat!

1459
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,140
I'm not cooking anything!

1460
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,740
I'm just telling childhood stories!

1461
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,680
Before saying you're like the creepy uncle!

1462
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,420
We're almost there!

1463
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,960
Don't kill him!

1464
00:54:59,100 --> 00:54:59,460
That's what he said!

1465
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,400
The creepy uncle!

1466
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,180
No!

1467
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:01,660
No!

1468
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,540
I'll never... I'll never leave you alone with the creepy uncle!

1469
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,040
Don't worry!

1470
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,160
I've learned my lesson!

1471
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,300
You got some more purple gunk here!

1472
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,880
I think I have to spray this and then like unearth something.

1473
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,420
Oh, this?

1474
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,300
Oh, here!

1475
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,220
Water this plant!

1476
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,280
Water the pink flowers!

1477
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,200
I'm the cool aunt!

1478
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:28,580
I'm the cool aunt!

1479
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,400
What the fuck am I doing?

1480
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,700
Where are you?

1481
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,260
It's really magical watching you make all that grow!

1482
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,200
Oh, do I have to grow this?

1483
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,760
This is where I love gardening!

1484
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:39,860
Oh!

1485
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,220
I have to make this pretty again!

1486
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:43,500
Right?

1487
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:45,880
Yeah!

1488
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,060
It has to be!

1489
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,380

00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,360
I'm not over there!

1495
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:57,980
I held him?

1496
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:58,880
Okay!

1497
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,120

1500
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,760
I held him!

1501
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,520
That's the plant!

1502
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:08,580

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,660
I got it!

1510
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,460
Don't worry!

1511
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:15,980
I got it!

1512
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,780
You did not get it!

1513
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,240
I got it!

1514
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:17,820

00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:18,700
I got it!

1518
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,280
Do you not see me reviving?

1519
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,140
I'm holding on him!

1520
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,160
I can't break through!

1521
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,660
Oh god!

1522
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,000
Oh god!

1523
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:29,660
I'm getting shot at!

1524
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,380
I'm getting shot at!

1525
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,060
I am 1 HP!

1526
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,060
I'm holding!

1527
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:32,900
He's literally 1 hit!

1528
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,100
He's literally 1 hit!

1529
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:37,900
It's okay!

1530
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:38,280
It's okay!

1531
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,480
I need to get rid of the fliers first.

1532
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,200
Okay!

1533
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:42,900
Don't worry!

1534
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:43,380
I got you!

1535
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,440
Anyways, maybe that's why I'm not normal.

1536
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,700
And that's how you do it!

1537
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,860
Wait, how do we hold?

1538
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,280
Oh, okay!

1539
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:49,680
There you go!

1540
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,000
Can I help out with this?

1541
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,560
It looks like you are!

1542
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,020
I'm the cool aunt!

1543
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,240
I'm the cool aunt!

1544
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,820
Dude, I feel like I told you so much...

1545
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,540
Well, not you.

1546
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,900
But I feel like I told you chat so much about my childhood past few takes 2 streams.

1547
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,640
Me talking to clay when I was younger.

1548
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:10,380
Anyways...

1549
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,460
Oh yeah, the clay story.

1550
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,380
Yeah, when I was locked up.

1551
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,980
Yeah, now we sort of know why you're like this.

1552
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,900
No, my family was so tough on me What?

1553
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,260
What did you do?

1554
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,700
But like, why?

1555
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,000
I got a C.

1556
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,640
Oh, you got a C for your book report?

1557
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:38,820
No.

1558
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,280
They just decided to do that as a punishment.

1559
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,280
Like, but why did you kill- was this the first book they found?

1560
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:46,700
Yeah.

1561
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,580
Yeah.

1562
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,440
So how did you- so how was the book?

1563
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,840
I didn't- well, I read the book.

1564
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,480
I read it.

1565
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,900
So like, how was the book though?

1566
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,880
I didn't finish the assignment.

1567
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,000
Wait, you didn't finish it?

1568
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,580
And because I didn't finish it, I had to get locked in my room for a whole week.

1569
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,080
Oh my god.

1570
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,220
Also, we were supposed to go to the other side and water this area.

1571
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,700
Oh my god.

1572
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,160
So how did you- Yeah.

1573
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,640
So no one- so that's why you don't like reading?

1574
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,480
No, I love reading.

1575
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,660
Wait, then why don't you read?

1576
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,000
I didn't finish to kill a mockingbird.

1577
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:23,900
I did.

1578
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,520
No, you said- I finished it like four times.

1579
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,000
You just said you didn't.

1580
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,280
I didn't finish writing it by hand, man.

1581
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,280
Oh, then when I asked you how was the book, you were like, oh, I didn't finish it.

1582
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,580
Oh, and then you were asking me how was like finished writing it.

1583
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,260
No, I said how was the book?

1584
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,240
You like it because- Yeah, it was pretty good.

1585
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:42,680
I liked it.

1586
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:47,180
Okay, but did you like it because of the punishment that you got Stockholm Syndrome for it?

1587
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,480
No, I liked it before.

1588
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,820
Or did you actually like it?

1589
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,180
Actually, maybe it could have been Stockholm.

1590
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:57,640
Yeah, I was gonna say it could have been Stockholm Syndrome because of- Because you wrote so much of it, you just had to like it at that point.

1591
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:01,160
How the fuck do we fix this- fix this plan?

1592
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,760
How do we fix this?

1593
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,500
She had to read it to be able to argue her way out the gulag?

1594
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,080
No.

1595
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,140
I got the gulag!

1596
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,240
Holy shit.

1597
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,860
How the fuck do we- Um...

1598
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,820
I had to plant more?

1599
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,120
But I planted so much!

1600
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,840
Oh, it was like this tiny patch!

1601
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:36,920
That's so stupid.

1602
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:45,420
It was like literally the tiniest fucking patch of- The little tiniest thing that I didn't fucking planted.

1603
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,580
Don't worry, I'm helping.

1604
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,440
The one spot.

1605
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,780
Anyways, uh...

1606
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,280
That's all the childhood stories I have for you today.

1607
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,260
I think like the most exciting thing from my childhood was, um...

1608
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:09,180
Was when like I was alone in my- I was- My parents left me home alone.

1609
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:13,120
And then like I made like this makeshift fishing pole.

1610
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,500
And like...

1611
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,940
I sat in my- And there was like this drawer thing.

1612
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,140
So I would like pretend I'd be fishing and stuff.

1613
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,180
Um...

1614
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,000
I would- I went to my parents' room.

1615
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,960
I was like pretending I'm fishing.

1616
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,020
And then my hook accidentally hooked into the drawer.

1617
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,800
Like this giant drawer cabinet thing.

1618
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,520
And then I p- Me being a little dumbass was like, Oh my god, I caught a big fish!

1619
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:40,480
And then I like pulled it so hard that the entire drawer like fell down.

1620
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:45,880
But like I was so lucky because like I freaked out and I like- Pull it!

1621
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,640
Pull it!

1622
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,320
I freaked out and I like dropped down.

1623
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,680
And then the bed, like you know like the backboard, the frontboard thing.

1624
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,400
Where are you?

1625
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,760
Where- Why did you leave?

1626
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:00,640
It made me touch the hose.

1627
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,540
I don't know what.

1628
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,340
But like the bed, like frontboard thing blocked the drawer cabinet from squishing me.

1629
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,800
So I could have been dead.

1630
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,540
I could have actually died.

1631
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,740
And then what's fucked up was that...

1632
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,400
Um...

1633
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:17,740
Um...

1634
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:28,660
My parents, like recently, they like found- Cause they- The furniture for our old furniture when I was little.

1635
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,380
My childhood furniture and stuff.

1636
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,000
Was uh...

1637
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,240
Was being stored somewhere.

1638
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,420
And then my parents recently got the furniture out.

1639
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:41,000
And like now that drawer that almost squished me is in my bedroom.

1640
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,560
Oh ho!

1641
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,580
Hahahaha!

1642
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:47,850
That's it.

1643
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,370
We're down to the last!

1644
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:53,290
And then when my mom, like when my parents like moved it into my bedroom.

1645
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,570
They're like, remember this drawer?

1646
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:57,010
Doki, do you remember this drawer?

1647
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:59,350
That's the drawer that almost killed you!

1648
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,590
And I was like, alright.

1649
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:01,410
Hahahaha!

1650
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,850
Ah, memories!

1651
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:06,270
Ew.

1652
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,470
What the fuck I'm seeing some guys.

1653
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:08,810
Oh god.

1654
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:09,250
Oh I see.

1655
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:09,790
Oh ho.

1656
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,850
Oh my god, it's boss battle time.

1657
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:15,910
No, Joy!

1658
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,070
Maybe we're too late!

1659
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:20,190
Ew, it's breathing at us.

1660
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:20,650
Be careful.

1661
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,530
Oh my god.

1662
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:24,410
She cute.

1663
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:25,670
It's okay, we're here to help.

1664
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:26,710
It's Cody!

1665
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:28,090
I made you.

1666
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:29,570
Do you remember me?

1667
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,430
Hello beautiful flower.

1668
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,490
I made you.

1669
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:35,110
Oh.

1670
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,290
She crazy, I like that.

1671
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:38,750
Hahahaha!

1672
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:39,950
Oh!

1673
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,990
I can fix her.

1674
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:43,890
Oh!

1675
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:45,510
Hahahaha!

1676
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:46,450
What?

1677
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:47,650
What?

1678
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:48,050
Hahahaha!

1679
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:48,570
Hahahaha!

1680
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:50,550
Hahahaha!

1681
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:50,950
Hahahaha!

1682
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:52,030
Hahahaha!

1683
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:52,850
It was me!

1684
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:54,490
You fucking bastard!

1685
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:56,250
It was me!!!

1686
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1687
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:03,490
Wait, I need to be immersive here.

1688
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:04,510
I need...

1689
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:05,450
Hahahaha!

1690
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,510
Wait, give me a sec!

1691
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:14,270
There has to be like, some immersion here.

1692
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,010
Let me know before you unpause.

1693
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,050
Okay, I'm ready!

1694
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:18,450
Are you ready?

1695
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:19,530
No!

1696
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,070
I'm ready.

1697
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:20,610
Are you ready?

1698
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,570
I'm ready though.

1699
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,290
No, I'm not ready.

1700
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,230
Are you ready?

1701
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:24,990
I'm ready.

1702
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:27,950
Okay, I'm ready.

1703
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,470
Okay, okay.

1704
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,050
I'm ready.

1705
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:33,770
I'm ready.

1706
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:35,690
Alright, I'm ready for the immersion.

1707
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,810
It's immersion time.

1708
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,910
Oh my god, I'm stronger as a tomato too.

1709
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,270
Look how strong I am.

1710
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,610
Look how strong I am.

1711
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,710
I can't move!

1712
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,290
You have to un-gunk it!

1713
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,830
I'm literally washing right now!

1714
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:50,710
You have to un-gunk it!

1715
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:51,530
Un-gunk it!

1716
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,030
It's lore accurate.

1717
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,230
Who would have thought?

1718
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,230
I knew being a husband was the right idea.

1719
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:03,170
I knew I was meant to be a husband.

1720
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:04,850
There you go.

1721
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,130
Okay, I'm literally washing it.

1722
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:07,890
I think you need to...

1723
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:08,910
I'm trying... No!

1724
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:11,870
No!

1725
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:15,350
My show is so short-lived.

1726
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:17,190
It's okay.

1727
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,330
That's all of them, eh?

1728
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:19,970
Give me some water over there.

1729
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,130
What do I do?

1730
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,210
She has a name?

1731
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,390
Yeah, you named her.

1732
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:27,230
I named her?

1733
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,210
New wife.

1734
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,410
You're what?!

1735
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:34,490
You jealous?

1736
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:35,970
Are you jealous?

1737
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:40,290
I am!

1738
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,530
You jealous, aren't you, Gumi?

1739
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,710
You wish you had this!

1740
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:46,930
I actually am not.

1741
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:51,770
I'm just surprised that's happening in front of my face.

1742
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:52,450
I'm just surprised that's happening in front of my face.

1743
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:54,710
I'm just surprised that's happening in front of my face.

1744
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:55,950
You wish.

1745
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:58,810
Now you regret what you can't have.

1746
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:01,530
I think I'm chill, actually.

1747
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:04,490
What are we doing here?

1748
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:06,450
Where's this?

1749
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:08,590
There's something growing out of her!

1750
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:09,470
I see that!

1751
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:10,370
Joy!

1752
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:12,290
We've come to save you!

1753
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:12,950
Joy!

1754
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:13,870
No!

1755
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:14,490
No!

1756
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,490
Don't do it!

1757
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,030
I can fix you, Joy!

1758
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,910
Think of all the good things we did together!

1759
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:22,930
Oh.

1760
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,690
This is like Baby's first platformer.

1761
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:29,510
It's like Cuphead!

1762
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:33,990
Have you ever played Cuphead?

1763
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:35,330
No.

1764
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:36,930
Me either.

1765
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:38,130
Oh, fuck!

1766
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,930
Man, it's Baby's first platformer, alright!

1767
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:43,090
It's Baby's first platformer!

1768
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:43,770
I'm still alive!

1769
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:46,570
Wait, wait, okay.

1770
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:47,050
I made it.

1771
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,070
I made it too.

1772
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,330
Look at that.

1773
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:59,170
I think this flower is better than Poison Ivy because she's more plant.

1774
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:04,630
She doesn't need a Compensate by being half human.

1775
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:05,050
She doesn't need a Compensate by being half human.

1776
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,150
She's full plant.

1777
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:08,670
And that's why we love her.

1778
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,630
What are you on about?

1779
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:13,190
What?

1780
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:14,910
You don't think she's hot?

1781
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:16,170
Look at her!

1782
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:18,630
That's my new wife you're talking to.

1783
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:19,350
Oh my god!

1784
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:20,530
Oh my god, is it time?

1785
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:22,610
Oh, I'm a potato!

1786
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:25,450
I'm a potato!

1787
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:26,770
Really?

1788
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:28,790
You really think now is the time for jokes?

1789
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:29,510
You know what he thinks?

1790
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:32,590
I'm washing it!

1791
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:35,710
The freakiest ones are the ones with multiple eyes.

1792
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,810
Like the potatoes with multiple eyes.

1793
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:38,530
Have you seen that?

1794
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:39,610
Yeah.

1795
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:41,330
That shit is so freaky.

1796
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,540
Where the fuck is the...

1797
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,540
Where's the... Oh, there it is.

1798
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,880
I'm on it.

1799
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,300
I'm a... Just don't hurt my new wife!

1800
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,300
She's too beautiful to die.

1801
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,520
And a little... She's too crazy to die.

1802
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,400
I like them a little crazy.

1803
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,160
Alright, get in her!

1804
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,140
Don't worry!

1805
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:12,400
Watch this.

1806
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,560
Are you watching?

1807
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:18,700
I need to be sure that you're watching.

1808
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,180
I'm busy.

1809
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,360
Okay.

1810
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,460
Get over here!

1811
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,460
You have to go down my arm!

1812
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,320
My beautiful sexy arm.

1813
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,560
Oh my god, it's from my back.

1814
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:43,260
Don't stick your fertilizer into crazy!

1815
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,180
Oh my god.

1816
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,680
You can't tell me what to do!

1817
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,180
I'm gonna put all the fertilizer.

1818
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,120
So she'll grow up big and strong.

1819
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,380
Just like how the gardener likes it.

1820
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,540
Just like how the gardener likes it.

1821
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,340
What's gonna happen?

1822
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,440
I don't understand this.

1823
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,740
Oh, what?

1824
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,800
What is this?

1825
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,560
What is she gonna do?

1826
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,240
Oh...

1827
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,720
Oh, okay.

1828
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,740
It's just dodging again.

1829
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,460
But this time we're in the air.

1830
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,020
It's just...

1831
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,200
It's just dodging with extra steps.

1832
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:36,760
Easy.

1833
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:40,680
Let's go.

1834
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:41,700
We're so smart.

1835
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,020
Oh, now there's less...

1836
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:44,540
Oh, okay.

1837
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:45,960
It's okay.

1838
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,940
Okay, the plate to the right is gonna break.

1839
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,260
Not yet.

1840
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,540
This plate is definitely gonna break though.

1841
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,360
What?!

1842
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,180
I tied them perfectly!

1843
01:08:59,520 --> 01:08:59,960
Don't die!

1844
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:00,380
Don't die!

1845
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,520
I'm good now.

1846
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:03,400
Whoa!

1847
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,060
Here, sentry.

1848
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,580
Wait, that...

1849
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:08,900
Ah!

1850
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,700
Don't die!

1851
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:10,260
Don't die!

1852
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,940
I didn't tie them perfectly!

1853
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,720
Look, it is easy.

1854
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,160
I'm just trying to make you look good.

1855
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,800
Well, you've been doing that quite a bit.

1856
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,980
I mean, you clearly meet the wind here.

1857
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:29,500
Nice.

1858
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,180
Don't worry.

1859
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,240
Are you ready to watch again?

1860
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:35,660
Oh, my God!

1861
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:36,040
Oh, my God!

1862
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:36,580
I'm a lemon!

1863
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:38,840
It's a lime!

1864
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:39,360
It's a lime!

1865
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:39,940
I'm a lemon!

1866
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,260
Look at me go!

1867
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,020
Oh, my God!

1868
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,460
It's making squeaky noises!

1869
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,320
Oh, my God!

1870
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,000
Here we go.

1871
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:51,740
I'm doing it.

1872
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:52,660
Where's the other one?

1873
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:53,500
Oh, the other one's right here.

1874
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,500
A lime is just a lemon that just wants to be special.

1875
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:01,120
Okay.

1876
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:01,860
Get over here.

1877
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
She's got major flow of energy!

1878
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,180
Okay, you have to kill that one guy.

1879
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,040
Oh, my God!

1880
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,700
I'm trying to wash the floor for you!

1881
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:19,580
Watch the group!

1882
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,200
This lemon is not doing so well!

1883
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,060
There's one more here.

1884
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:25,480
One more here.

1885
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:27,580
Alright.

1886
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:28,180
Oh, my God!

1887
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,200
I'm cracking right now.

1888
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:31,740
Alright, we're good.

1889
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,000
Are you watching?

1890
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,080
Hahaha!

1891
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:36,740
Hahaha!

1892
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,020
Now turn around!

1893
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,560
I need you to keep watching!

1894
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,400
She spawns!

1895
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:44,820
She spawns!

1896
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,500
I can't!

1897
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,360
Three times?

1898
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,600
Damn, Cody!

1899
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:51,860
Hahaha!

1900
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,040
That's when you know it's true love.

1901
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,980
Alright, I need you to hit my head.

1902
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,560
And we're gonna get rid of it once and for all!

1903
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,280
We're doing it!

1904
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,980
Oh, they can't even touch you!

1905
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,200
Yeah, that match is better not touch you.

1906
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,660
Don't look away!

1907
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:12,700
Hahaha!

1908
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,760
I told you she's beautiful!

1909
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,400
It really is!

1910
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,560
Oh, my God!

1911
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,200
Are you okay?

1912
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,840
Are you okay, wife?

1913
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:34,940
I am now!

1914
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:35,840
Whoa!

1915
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,160
Why can't you be nice like Joy?

1916
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,480
Don't thank me!

1917
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,240
I don't want you, man!

1918
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,000
Go ahead, date a flower!

1919
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:43,600
Hahaha!

1920
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:45,840
I'm sorry!

1921
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:46,820
No!

1922
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,360
I'm sorry!

1923
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,260
What the fuck am I sorry about?

1924
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:53,640
I didn't understand how important it was for Cody!

1925
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,500
Bro, are you the...

1926
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:55,940
Hahaha!

1927
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,120
That's good!

1928
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:00,080
Oh, my God!

1929
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,000
Look, we got an approval!

1930
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,600
Cody gave up on being...

1931
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:04,800
Oh!

1932
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,880
Because I got caught!

1933
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,260
Hahaha!

1934
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:09,920
Hahaha!

1935
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,640
Hahaha!

1936
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:14,820
She caught me with...

1937
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,840
my Joy!

1938
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:16,360
Hahaha!

1939
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,220
Yeah!

1940
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,560
Idiot!

1941
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,760
Don't worry, Joy.

1942
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,440
I'll never give you up.

1943
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:40,500
You're clearly better...

1944
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,640
than this bitch.

1945
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:43,560
Hahaha!

1946
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,340
Hahaha!

1947
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,460
I'll never give you up, Joy.

1948
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,480
I hope you're happy with Joy.

1949
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,520
I am.

1950
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,560
I'm so happy.

1951
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:53,640
Let me look at her!

1952
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,880
She's so pretty!

1953
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:55,440
My God!

1954
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,100
Imagine being this fucking kid and seeing these things happening!

1955
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,960
Bro, she clearly...

1956
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:01,940
She already has trauma.

1957
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:02,960
Oh, my God!

1958
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,320
It's a stupid clown thing!

1959
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,020
And an octopus!

1960
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:05,980
Oh, yeah!

1961
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,520
I still can't believe a millennial...

1962
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,940
bought a fucking jack-in-the-box.

1963
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,780
I mean, to be fair...

1964
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:18,480
she's already going through trauma.

1965
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,640
So it's just one more thing...

1966
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,520
for her therapist.

1967
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,420
Hey, that's what my family said too.

1968
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:24,980
Hahaha!

1969
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,060
Hey!

1970
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,100
Fuck it!

1971
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,900
Make me the right to kill a mockingbird again!

1972
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:32,460
Hey!

1973
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:32,500
Fuck it!

1974
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:32,500
Make me the right to kill a mockingbird again!

1975
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:32,520
Hey!

1976
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,300
Fuck it!

1977
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:34,420
Make me the right to kill a mockingbird again!

1978
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,060
Letter piece numero...

1979
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:36,720
three!

1980
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,260
And now...

1981
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,480
how do you find...

1982
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,080
your purpose in life?

1983
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,100
Through...

1984
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,380
passion!

1985
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,360
Passion?

1986
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,040
Again?

1987
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,860
I already have Joy!

1988
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,460
Now, it's time to find...

1989
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,640
Yeah, who's your Joy?

1990
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,880
Who's your Joy?

1991
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,940
Who's your Joy?

1992
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,580
Everyone has a passion!

1993
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,120
Who's your side piece?

1994
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:04,680
I'm getting a phone call.

1995
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:05,420
Hold on, I'm getting a phone call.

1996
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:06,900
Jeremy?

1997
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:09,920
You want me to stay...

1998
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,500
stay up late at the office again?

1999
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,620
Oh, we have overtime again?

2000
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,040
Oh, God!

2001
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,840
You want me to wear something nice...

2002
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,460
for over...

2003
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:20,840
Oh, don't worry, Jeremy.

2004
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,080
Letter piece numero...

2005
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,540
What the f...

2006
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:27,680
What the fuck was that?

2007
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:29,860
Mess!

2008
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,520
Yeah, we really need to clean up our attic.

2009
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:39,340
Hey!

2010
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,160
You recognize this suitcase?

2011
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,060
Huh?

2012
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:43,960
What is that?

2013
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,040
Oh, I don't like where this is going.

2014
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,240
Uh-oh.

2015
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,860
Is that Beep Boombox?

2016
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:49,420
Daddy!

2017
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,100
It's a record player!

2018
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:51,900
Oh!

2019
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,240
Welcome to the concert hall!

2020
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:57,920
Mae!

2021
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,860
It's time to sing!

2022
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,600
Oh, no, no, I can't sing.

2023
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:02,720
I haven't done it for years.

2024
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:03,680
Come on, Mae!

2025
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,980
It's the last letter piece unless you sing.

2026
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,460
You just get up on that stage and you show them what you've got.

2027
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,800
All you have to do is sing!

2028
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:12,420
I have to fucking...

2029
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,400
I have to fucking save my garden and save my joy.

2030
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,420
We need that!

2031
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,940
Oh, my God, my joy with singing!

2032
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,800
I'm not gonna sing a single note.

2033
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,380
Who are you singing with?

2034
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,880
Is this gonna turn into a musical?

2035
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,160
Oh!

2036
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,100
What?

2037
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,980
Will you turn that off, you stupid...

2038
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:33,260
Come on!

2039
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,100
Is this the musical episode?

2040
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,480
Every show has one.

2041
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,140
And they're always terrible.

2042
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,620
She sure does, Cody.

2043
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,300
And you will help her find her voice again!

2044
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:44,920
Dabba!

2045
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:45,540
Oh!

2046
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,500
Now, go and buy some...

2047
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,120
Oh, it's like that fucking singing game!

2048
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:54,880
The...

2049
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,840
Um...

2050
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,560
What was it?

2051
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,960
The clapping one?

2052
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:03,320
Have you ever seen that singing game where you have to actually sing in the microphone to actually get stuff done?

2053
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,760
Okay, let me swap back my skin suit.

2054
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,000
I feel a little naked.

2055
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,420
Let me change real quick.

2056
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,000
I'm a little naked here.

2057
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,580
Give me a sec.

2058
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,040
Give me a sec.

2059
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,520
Okay, I'm good.

2060
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,680
One hand clapping?

2061
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:32,340
Yeah!

2062
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,600
One hand clapping!

2063
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,000
That's what it reminds me of.

2064
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,640
That's the actual title?

2065
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2066
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,740
It's like this...

2067
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:45,600
It's like you actually sing in the mic and then it like fucking registers your voice and stuff.

2068
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,560
What do I do with this fucking...

2069
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,160
Oh!

2070
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,440
It's like a little discus.

2071
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,240
What are you supposed to do here?

2072
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:53,780
Whoa!

2073
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,800
Is that game over there?

2074
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,460
Yeah, that's the game.

2075
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:55,820
That's the game.

2076
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:56,700
That's the waste track.

2077
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,100
Hey Cody!

2078
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:58,980
Over here!

2079
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:01,560
Alright.

2080
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,560
Complete three laps to win.

2081
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,920
Don't leave me at the lost things!

2082
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,960
Which way does it go though?

2083
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,420
Oh, it's on the left.

2084
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,640
Am I... What color am I?

2085
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:15,340
Oh!

2086
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,000
I'm green!

2087
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,280
How do you do that?

2088
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:17,580
What?

2089
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,920
What are you doing to it?

2090
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:20,080
I don't know!

2091
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:23,020
I don't... How are you controlling it?

2092
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,080
I'm not controlling it, man.

2093
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,680
Oh, we can go to the next level.

2094
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,280
Too fast!

2095
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:28,340
Oh!

2096
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,020
Look, instructions unclear.

2097
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,500
I didn't know you could...

2098
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,360
It didn't say.

2099
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,920
It didn't tell me that you had to slow down.

2100
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,740
I just assumed we go fast and we turn.

2101
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,460
Okay, I figured it.

2102
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,820
I'll be honest, I've just been tapping it.

2103
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,420
Okay, I understand now.

2104
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,800
Don't worry, I can catch up.

2105
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,860
I can catch up right here.

2106
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:54,720
Rematch!

2107
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:55,380
No, no, no, no!

2108
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:55,880
Rematch!

2109
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:58,020
Rematch!

2110
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:58,520
Rematch!

2111
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,360
Rematch!

2112
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,360
This time!

2113
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,580
This time, now that I know the game.

2114
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,640
Whoa!

2115
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,000
Whoa!

2116
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,100
Wait, how are you so faster than me?

2117
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:16,420
No!

2118
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,000
I'm done.

2119
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,320
I'm done.

2120
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,140
I know my limits.

2121
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:27,580
I know my limits.

2122
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,720
I know my limits.

2123
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,360
Ooh, the backstage.

2124
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,220
This is where I'm gonna meet Jeremy?

2125
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,440
Yeah, he's my manager.

2126
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:39,680
Yeah, he's my manager.

2127
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:39,700
Whoa!

2128
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,880
What the fuck?

2129
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:46,160
Why is it so scary?

2130
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,900
Why abandoned dreams live here?

2131
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,320
Why abandoned dreams live here?

2132
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,980
This is where your hopes and dreams die.

2133
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:57,220
This symbol is like a shield.

2134
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:57,800
This symbol is like a shield.

2135
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,820
I'm the symbol superhero.

2136
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,640
Why didn't I get a shield?

2137
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,740
You got the greatest weapon of all.

2138
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,480
Yeah, your voice.

2139
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,120
Oh!

2140
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,280
See, I can still be romantic.

2141
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:11,780
See, I can still be romantic.

2142
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,680
This is a powerful maid.

2143
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,020
What's this?

2144
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,340
Aim and throw.

2145
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,980
Oh, I have to cut this myself.

2146
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,240
Oh, what the fuck?

2147
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,020
You can kill stuff with your voice.

2148
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,080
Oh, who broke the fucking...

2149
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,520
Someone broke the lever here.

2150
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,720
We're not alone.

2151
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:36,950
Oh, that's cool, actually.

2152
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:39,550
Okay.

2153
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,690
How do we do this?

2154
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,330
Oh, yeah, it is like one hand clapping.

2155
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:46,790
Ow!

2156
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:47,510
What?

2157
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,230
Does it get too hot?

2158
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:50,250
Oh!

2159
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:53,750
You have to keep singing because it gets hotter.

2160
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,830
When it's like up, it cools down.

2161
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:02,110
Yeah, see?

2162
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,490
You have to keep singing!

2163
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:04,010
You have to keep singing!

2164
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:04,630
You have to keep singing!

2165
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,530
Do I have to make you get all the way over there?

2166
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:07,050
I think so.

2167
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:08,170
Right?

2168
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:08,910
Oh,

2169
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:12,420
I'm so sorry.

2170
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,860
Yeah, you have to keep singing for now.

2171
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:15,920
Oh!

2172
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,540
I think it... What?

2173
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,740
Is there a pathway?

2174
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:24,440
I feel like you have to keep singing until...

2175
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:29,260
Because there's a thingy on my thingy too.

2176
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,420
There's a thing?

2177
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:30,780
Oh!

2178
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,200
Wait, what?

2179
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,100
Wait, I can jump and sing at the same time.

2180
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,760
Oh, okay.

2181
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:40,380
You know what?

2182
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:40,980
Hahaha!

2183
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,800
I thought it was one of those that I had to stand still for.

2184
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,960
Yeah, but you can actually move when you're singing.

2185
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:49,720
How did I miss?

2186
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,000
It's okay.

2187
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:51,780
What?

2188
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,400
Oh, hey, you have to come back.

2189
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,880
Hey, I missed the last jump.

2190
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,220
Hey, hey, hey, wife.

2191
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,520
We're still not finalizing our divorce yet.

2192
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:01,920
Wife.

2193
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,040
Hey, wife.

2194
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,940
You can't go there without me, wife.

2195
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:05,360
Okay, try dying now.

2196
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,140
See if it gets you...

2197
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:08,220
Hey, wife.

2198
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:09,740
Oh, my God.

2199
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,160
Look, I know you don't want me to meet Jeremy, but I let you meet my joy, so I think it's fair.

2200
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:24,060
Huh?

2201
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:29,160
I think it's fair that, you know, we meet each other's, you know, happiness.

2202
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,420
Alright, nice.

2203
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:37,380
I'm here now.

2204
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:39,100
Don't worry, I can't miss this time.

2205
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,420
I'm out.

2206
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:42,640
I'm out!

2207
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,320
Just keep singing!

2208
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,700
I asked!

2209
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:47,020
The bar was empty!

2210
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:51,460
Okay.

2211
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:53,700
Okay, alright.

2212
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,920
You come back and, like, chill.

2213
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:56,980
Okay, never mind.

2214
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,600
I guess not.

2215
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,540
I guess not.

2216
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,460
I guess not.

2217
01:21:59,520 --> 01:21:59,540
I guess not.

2218
01:21:59,540 --> 01:21:59,640
What do you mean?

2219
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:00,560
I come back and chill.

2220
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,640
I guess not.

2221
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,780
I came back?

2222
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:04,860
Okay, alright.

2223
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,280
Look, we can do this.

2224
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,320
This cannot be the puzzle that we struggle the most.

2225
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,880
What do you mean, we can do this?

2226
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:17,620
This cannot be the puzzle that we are married, so our troubles are shared.

2227
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,580
I've already signed the prenup.

2228
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,720
I forgot to sign the prenup.

2229
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:24,560
What?

2230
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,360
Alright, here we go.

2231
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,140
See, look at that.

2232
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,000
We did it together.

2233
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,300
It's not a skill, it's a group skill issue.

2234
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:35,880
Damn.

2235
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:36,240
Oh.

2236
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:36,480
Yay!

2237
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,300
Alright.

2238
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,360
I guess I go up?

2239
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,520
Oh, maybe I might cut this?

2240
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:44,380
No?

2241
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,580
Oh, I have to cut the thing over here.

2242
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,060
Wait, no, I have to get you over here.

2243
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,200
Wait, how did you get here?

2244
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,840
How did you get here?

2245
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,160
I didn't look.

2246
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,380
There's a microphone right here.

2247
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:57,460
Oh!

2248
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:09,890
I did it.

2249
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:10,630
You're welcome.

2250
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:11,810
Oh!

2251
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:15,830
What the fuck?

2252
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:17,290
Your grandpa was sick as hell.

2253
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:18,130
Oh my god.

2254
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:22,010
Alright, we need to grab the last coin.

2255
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:25,110
Alright.

2256
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:25,490
Oh!

2257
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:28,650
Here we go.

2258
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:33,890
Alright.

2259
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:34,430
Oooh!

2260
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:36,590
Look at that funky beat.

2261
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:42,950
Okay.

2262
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:44,230
We have to go this way.

2263
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:45,910
I love my grandpa!

2264
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:47,210
I love my grandpa!

2265
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:47,510
I love my grandpa!

2266
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:51,330
I'm pretty sure if we sell this we can get a lot of money.

2267
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:53,470
What the fuck?

2268
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:57,750
I'm just saying.

2269
01:23:58,010 --> 01:23:58,150
I'm just saying.

2270
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:59,530
If somehow...

2271
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:02,170
If somehow I go broke.

2272
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:04,810
I have to thank grandpa for this.

2273
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:05,870
I have to thank grandpa for this.

2274
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:06,310
Wait, what do we...

2275
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:10,530
I need this thing here.

2276
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:13,050
What's this for?

2277
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:21,430
Oh, I have to break this.

2278
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:24,310
Wait, I'm breaking my grandpa's jukebox?

2279
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:27,550
That's fucked up.

2280
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:32,110
Keep going.

2281
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,070
Keep shouting.

2282
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:38,790
Keep destroying my hopes and dreams because it doesn't matter anymore.

2283
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:45,710
This is my grandpa's jukebox.

2284
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:46,730
What do you mean?

2285
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,930
Oh, now you left in the attic because you just stopped caring.

2286
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:54,050
Okay, now I have to push.

2287
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:00,230
Jesus, what the fuck is that?

2288
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:01,310
Oh...

2289
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:03,930
Let's fire this baby up!

2290
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,070
Let her rip, babe!

2291
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:06,430
Oh!

2292
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:07,310
Oh!

2293
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:08,710
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2294
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:10,650
I have to bring this up.

2295
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:12,070
I was like, why is this working?

2296
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:13,190
Alright.

2297
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:15,130
Put down.

2298
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,010
Okay, here we go.

2299
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,070
We're upping up the base.

2300
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:24,550
Oh, shit.

2301
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:26,270
You going?

2302
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:30,910
Alright, I'm all the way up.

2303
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:37,960
What the heck?

2304
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,120
Where are we?

2305
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:41,680
Why do you have all the way up?

2306
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:42,420
Why do you have all this equipment?

2307
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,380
I thought this was just a hobby.

2308
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,960
Good work, both of you.

2309
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,280
You've earned the speakers.

2310
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,800
We've earned the speakers.

2311
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:52,180
What?

2312
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:53,980
What's the speaker for?

2313
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,040
Keep on going.

2314
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,020
You're still missing the mics and lines.

2315
01:25:58,920 --> 01:25:59,440
Woohoo!

2316
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:00,580
Boots gonna be toasty.

2317
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,480
What the hell?

2318
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,840
You've been first, Cody.

2319
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,460
I'll use your symbol for it.

2320
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,380
Oh, I blocked the thing with my symbol.

2321
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:11,680
Oh, I blocked the thing with my symbol.

2322
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,780
Watch this.

2323
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:14,740
BAAAAM!

2324
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,020
My lady.

2325
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,580
Oh, no thank you.

2326
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,420
Chivory's dead.

2327
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:24,740
Wait.

2328
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:26,420
Here we go.

2329
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:28,720
BAAAAM!

2330
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:38,070
Wait, why can't I fucking get past this?

2331
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:39,770
Oh, I have to go like that.

2332
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:43,230
Still no thank you, fucking Chivory.

2333
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:43,650
Chivory's dead.

2334
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:47,030
Oh, look, look, look.

2335
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:47,430
Over there.

2336
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:48,790
What?

2337
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,870
You have to do something over here.

2338
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:51,670
I do?

2339
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,570
No, look at this pad, because it matches colors with these.

2340
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:56,050
Ohhhhh.

2341
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:01,350
Wait, what?

2342
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:04,790
Wait, what?

2343
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,930
Wait, what?

2344
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:06,710
Oh, you have to go B.

2345
01:27:06,990 --> 01:27:07,610
Oh, you have to go B.

2346
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:07,870
Yellow, yellow.

2347
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:09,210
I think.

2348
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:10,770
And then you take me straight up.

2349
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:12,030
Wait, what?

2350
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:13,190
D then?

2351
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:16,050
Oh, it's D.

2352
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:17,710
Oh, the B base!

2353
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:21,650
Wait, how do we go up?

2354
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:24,070
Oh, no!

2355
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:25,790
B, B, B.

2356
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:26,710
B.

2357
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:29,630
Yellow?

2358
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:29,850
B.

2359
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:30,730
Yellow, yellow, yellow.

2360
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:32,390
Green.

2361
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:33,350
Or A.

2362
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:33,930
Not.

2363
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:35,430
Orange, orange, orange.

2364
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,930
Okay.

2365
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:38,670
Keep going.

2366
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:39,810
Orange.

2367
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:40,530
Orange.

2368
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:44,110
Which way is this?

2369
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:45,510
Ah!

2370
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:46,490
Wrong way!

2371
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:48,730
You gotta send it back.

2372
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:51,350
Okay, I figured it out.

2373
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:53,270
I'm not on it, I'm not on it!

2374
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:53,470
Oh!

2375
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:55,490
I thought I had to send it back.

2376
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:56,490
Okay.

2377
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:57,510
Okay.

2378
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:00,350
Orange, orange, orange.

2379
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:02,170
Orange.

2380
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:03,910
Okay.

2381
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:06,510
Purple.

2382
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:09,730
Orange.

2383
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:10,510
Orange.

2384
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:14,210
Oh my god, I can't see.

2385
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:15,870
Orange.

2386
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:17,350
Purple, purple, purple.

2387
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:18,670
Purple.

2388
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:19,570
Purple.

2389
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:21,370
Green.

2390
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:24,490
Oh my god, we're so smart.

2391
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:24,770
Green.

2392
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:26,190
Green.

2393
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:28,250
Purple.

2394
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:31,710
Yeah!

2395
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:32,630
We did it!

2396
01:28:33,630 --> 01:28:34,710
Look at this teamwork!

2397
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:37,850
Oh, god.

2398
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:38,470
We got it!

2399
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:40,250
What do you mean, oh?

2400
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:40,910
Oh god.

2401
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:43,770
I was the one that had to dodge the fucking shields.

2402
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:46,190
Bam!

2403
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:47,410
Bam!

2404
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:48,210
Bam!

2405
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:49,310
There you go.

2406
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:50,010
Now you're heading out of it.

2407
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:51,830
No wonder my hopes and dreams are over.

2408
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:53,130
That's fucking right.

2409
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:56,870
When you get married, you can never have any more hopes and dreams.

2410
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:02,430
Our child is our hopes and dreams now.

2411
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:03,070
Our child is our hopes and dreams now.

2412
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:05,610
That's why we live like you said through the child.

2413
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:07,350
Oh my god!

2414
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,630
Yay!

2415
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:11,210
Time to tell another story.

2416
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:14,230
Yeah!

2417
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:14,870
Yeah!

2418
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:19,190
Time to give the child unrealistic expectations now!

2419
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:21,730
Because my hopes and dreams are dead.

2420
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:22,810
Because my hopes and dreams are dead.

2421
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:22,870
Because my hopes and dreams are dead.

2422
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:23,610
Because my hopes and dreams are dead.

2423
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,510
I'm okay by the way.

2424
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:30,110
Wait.

2425
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:31,610
Oh, we have to sing, okay.

2426
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,470
Alright.

2427
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:36,710
Yay!

2428
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:38,030
Yay!

2429
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:41,770
I don't know where we have to go here.

2430
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:42,770
Do I sing here?

2431
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:49,150
Wait, where are you going?

2432
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:51,590
Oh, here?

2433
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,590
Oh, there is something here.

2434
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:06,680
Woah!

2435
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,240
Up we go!

2436
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,460
Uh-oh.

2437
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:15,120
This is not a hobby at that point.

2438
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,740
How much money have you invested in this?

2439
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,320
Is this where...

2440
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:25,100
Like, there is way too many things here for a hobby.

2441
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,380
Oh, how do we do this?

2442
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,380
Yeah, try this.

2443
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:36,820
Trust me.

2444
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,660
Oh, it's like I'm fucking Marshmallow!

2445
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,560
Drop the bass.

2446
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:48,640
I don't know how Marshmallow does it.

2447
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,900
I'm coming down.

2448
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:55,480
Are you ready for the drop?

2449
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:59,700
Have you seen that TikTok video of like 19...

2450
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,420
Like the 1920s...

2451
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,440
Dance Club remix?

2452
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,520
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

2453
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,320
Oh god!

2454
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:10,940
Woah, woah.

2455
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,440
Don't worry, DJ Doki is here.

2456
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:20,640
Woah!

2457
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:21,720
Woah!

2458
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,360
This is trippy.

2459
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,920
Oh my god!

2460
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,080
How do I...

2461
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:28,820
Okay.

2462
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,220
Wait, what?

2463
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:30,960
Oh!

2464
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,100
The top was too...

2465
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,000
Oh!

2466
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:33,520
It's okay.

2467
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,500
Okay, okay, okay.

2468
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,560
And then you jump here.

2469
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:35,720
Wait, wait, wait.

2470
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:36,320
Okay, right there?

2471
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:37,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2472
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:37,500
I got it.

2473
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,340
Jump, jump.

2474
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,280
And then...

2475
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:40,540
Oh!

2476
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:41,840
I went the wrong way, but it's okay.

2477
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,660
I went the right way now.

2478
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,360
The right, right way.

2479
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:44,780
Okay.

2480
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:45,880
There you go.

2481
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:49,580
What the hell is happening?

2482
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,100
That shit is trippy.

2483
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:52,280
I like that mechanic.

2484
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,740
You've seen Osmosis Jones?

2485
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,200
Yeah!

2486
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:57,260
Alright.

2487
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,360
Let me use it.

2488
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:03,680
No, I'm not high enough.

2489
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:04,480
I'm not high enough.

2490
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:04,620
I'm good.

2491
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:04,940
I'm good.

2492
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:06,140
I'm good.

2493
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:06,500
I'm good.

2494
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:10,180
Alright.

2495
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:10,940
Turn on.

2496
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,140
Oh, we're recording!

2497
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:14,420
Get ready to sing!

2498
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:17,140
lol Mogu nothing,

2499
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:22,740
there.

2500
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,720
Goodbye, your hopes and dreams.

2501
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,780
No more singing for you.

2502
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:29,940
Oh, wait.

2503
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:30,500
What's this?

2504
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,620
Oh, he angy.

2505
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,440
Oh!

2506
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:36,380
You sing to it!

2507
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:36,900
It's...

2508
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:36,980
Oh!

2509
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:37,080
You sing to it!

2510
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,180
Oh, you're like a snake charmer!

2511
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,840
Go up.

2512
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,680
Oh, they're like little snakes!

2513
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,460
We're gonna kill your love.

2514
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,920
We're gonna kill all your dreams here.

2515
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,300
Oh, it moved!

2516
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,620
Wait, you need to sing to it.

2517
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,860
You need to sing to it.

2518
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,300
He's on me!

2519
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:07,780
He's on me!

2520
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:08,640
I'm too far!

2521
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:10,800
I'm dead.

2522
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,160
Where am I going?

2523
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:14,880
Am I dead forever?

2524
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:15,620
No.

2525
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,140
Oh, okay.

2526
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:18,380
Alright, I'm gonna push you over.

2527
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,260
You need to keep singing to it.

2528
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:22,920
Keep singing to it!

2529
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,000
I'm running out!

2530
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:24,920
I'm running out!

2531
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:26,840
Keep singing to it!

2532
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:28,840
I need you to sing to it!

2533
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:30,480
He's looking at me!

2534
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,080
Alright, he's dead.

2535
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,160
Alright.

2536
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:37,720
I got bored.

2537
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,260
I know you did.

2538
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:44,480
Wee!

2539
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,340
Oh, there's one above us!

2540
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:52,380
Sing!

2541
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:55,680
What the fuck?

2542
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,940
Why can't I... Wait, keep singing?

2543
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:00,860
Oh yeah, I got it.

2544
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,040
Wouldn't these spikes not hurt us?

2545
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:04,820
Oh, they do hurt us.

2546
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,500
They're made of foam!

2547
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,160
Why would these spikes hurt?

2548
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:10,940
It's literally foam!

2549
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,220
Please don't stop me!

2550
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,420
Please don't stop me!

2551
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:15,300
Okay, nice.

2552
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,000
You have to keep singing though.

2553
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:20,220
The snakes wanna hurt us.

2554
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,040
What?

2555
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:21,340
How?

2556
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,040
Hello.

2557
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:27,860
I'm...

2558
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:31,540
Well, I hope you're doing okay.

2559
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,880
Because I might be stuck here.

2560
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:37,720
I don't think there's a way for me to get back over.

2561
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,060
Is there?

2562
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,920
Oh, no.

2563
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,920
No, you just have to die.

2564
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,340
You have to die and come back.

2565
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,220
Cause I'm literally soft locked here.

2566
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:46,740
Oh my god.

2567
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:48,160
I'm stuck here!

2568
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:49,480
Oh no!

2569
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:50,880
No!

2570
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,780
Wait, you can come back!

2571
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:53,140
Okay!

2572
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,580
Oh my god.

2573
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,740
This is a group effort.

2574
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:00,600
All I'm saying.

2575
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,260
Okay, let me recharge my CPC real quick.

2576
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,280
I'm ready.

2577
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:04,780
Okay.

2578
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,080
Look at that!

2579
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:06,400
See!

2580
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:08,520
Look, it's not my fault.

2581
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,560
This is a group effort.

2582
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:11,040
I'm recharging.

2583
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:11,840
Alright.

2584
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:13,120
I'm gonna go up.

2585
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:14,880
I'm here.

2586
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:17,880
Everything's fine.

2587
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,080
Alright, you ready?

2588
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:21,620
Uh-huh.

2589
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,520
What the fuck?

2590
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:26,440
Oh!

2591
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,980
Don't worry, I'm coming back.

2592
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:30,560
I thought the thing was behind us.

2593
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:31,080
Oh!

2594
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,180
Fuck!

2595
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:36,140
I thought you were there, but it's okay.

2596
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,160
I'm coming back.

2597
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:38,820
I've just fed the snake again.

2598
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,000
Oh god.

2599
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:43,180
We did it.

2600
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:43,920
As a team.

2601
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:48,240
Oh!

2602
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:49,960
What was that?

2603
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,320
Oh, big snake!

2604
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:56,080
Dude, this is such a cool design though.

2605
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:59,600
Yeah, that is a cool... like, that's so creative for making it a snake.

2606
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:01,120
Oh no.

2607
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:01,460
Oh fuck.

2608
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,260
Oh no, it's Crash Bandicoot again.

2609
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:05,980
It's Crash Bandicoot.

2610
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:13,540
Okay, the amount of fucking money we have spent on these microphones though.

2611
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:16,460
I think we need to talk about where you got this money from.

2612
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,200
I worked for it.

2613
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,260
Yeah, but like, do you not care about our daughter's college tuition?

2614
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,620
I-I put in savings.

2615
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:27,480
Dude, do you not care?

2616
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:28,120
What about you?

2617
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:28,920
Do you not care?

2618
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:29,100
What about me?

2619
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:30,200
Why aren't you picking up another job?

2620
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,120
What do you mean another job?

2621
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,080
If you care so much, why don't you pick up a job?

2622
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:35,900
What do you mean?

2623
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:39,140
If you care so much, why don't you pick up a job?

2624
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,040
Instead of paying attention to Joy all day.

2625
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,120
Housework is a job!

2626
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,380
I literally took care of our... look at you, I died.

2627
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,180
She has school!

2628
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,600
Who's gonna take care of the house?

2629
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,460
You come home at 9 PM everyday.

2630
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:55,040
Who's gonna take care of the house?

2631
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:55,700
What the fuck?

2632
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:56,660
I didn't even see that sign.

2633
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:59,140
I'm having my breathing thanks.

2634
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,280
Oh, he's getting closer.

2635
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:08,480
All I'm saying is that you come home so fucking late.

2636
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:10,620
Like, what am I supposed to do?

2637
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:14,340
I can't get a job if you're gonna not be at home.

2638
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,780
Oh, not gonna say anything, huh?

2639
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,280
Not gonna say anything.

2640
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,680
What the fuck?

2641
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,380
I didn't know that.

2642
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,200
Why else would I have the jukebox?

2643
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,500
That's your grandfather's, man.

2644
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:31,960
Oh, sorry.

2645
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:36,200
I see my grandfather as my dad.

2646
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,320
Because my dad left.

2647
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:46,830
Two incomes are better than one.

2648
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:48,370
Make Doki work two jobs.

2649
01:37:48,510 --> 01:37:49,030
Yeah.

2650
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:51,370
Farming is a job!

2651
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:55,450
Did you say gardening?

2652
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:57,470
And you earn...

2653
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:58,230
Oh.

2654
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:59,830
That's a good job.

2655
01:37:59,830 --> 01:37:59,930
That's a good job.

2656
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:00,330
Oh, shit.

2657
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:02,690
But they're all like cut up.

2658
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:03,770
That's not... what?

2659
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:12,530
Seeing kill my grandparents.

2660
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:15,650
I didn't kill your grandparents!

2661
01:38:15,910 --> 01:38:18,250
Seeing kill my grandparents!

2662
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:20,950
What's this?

2663
01:38:21,710 --> 01:38:22,370
What?

2664
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:27,530
Oh!

2665
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:30,330
That's a hit, yo.

2666
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:31,970
Oh!

2667
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,060
That's it, right?

2668
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,220
That's it, right?

2669
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,800
Oh, we have to do more?

2670
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,000
Oh, we have to add more!

2671
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:56,800
Oh, we have to do more?

2672
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,000
Oh, there we go.

2673
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:57,280
We got it.

2674
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:57,540
We're good.

2675
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:57,800
Oh, there we go.

2676
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:57,800
We got it.

2677
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:57,800
We're good.

2678
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,320
Oh, look at that sick-ass fucking beat.

2679
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:04,780
Oh, look at that sick-ass fucking beat.

2680
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,140
Yeah, we made that.

2681
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,200
We made that.

2682
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:10,580
We made that.

2683
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:12,100
Yeah, what is our name?

2684
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,680
We're not a hit, but it's music.

2685
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,440
Daft Punk.

2686
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,660
Okay, well, I think that's copyright infringement.

2687
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,460
No, because it's funk, not punk.

2688
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:25,360
It's like bunk beds.

2689
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,540
We share bunk beds, so we're daft bunk.

2690
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:28,820
Like our...

2691
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:32,860
Our performance appearance, it's like a bunk bed.

2692
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,200
So you're on the top.

2693
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,200
Yeah, you're on the top.

2694
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:39,320
I'm on the top of the bunk bed, you're on the bottom of the bunk bed.

2695
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:40,820
And we DJ from there.

2696
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:44,020
Like the beds are like our DJ platforms.

2697
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:45,140
Like the DJ equipment.

2698
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,260
And then we're like the daft bunks.

2699
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:48,060
Because we use...

2700
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,760
It's so smart!

2701
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:52,980
It'll be so cool!

2702
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:54,580
People are gonna love it!

2703
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:59,320
And then we can sell like bunk beds as our like... as our product.

2704
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:00,600
As our brand.

2705
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:03,500
That

2706
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,240
sounds lame!

2707
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,320
You don't know art.

2708
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,140
You don't know creativity.

2709
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,680
Hey look, that spotlight must be for you.

2710
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:14,780
Uh, no thanks.

2711
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,300
Come on, man.

2712
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:17,600
You deserve to be in the spotlight.

2713
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:19,300
Daft bunk, y'all.

2714
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,940
Now get down there.

2715
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,220
Okay, okay.

2716
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:27,600
I guess it's my time to shine.

2717
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:31,120
It's my turn to be a star, baby.

2718
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:31,720
Hey, hey, hey!

2719
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:32,840
Lights on me!

2720
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:33,680
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

2721
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:36,320
I can get hurt if I'm not the center of the attention.

2722
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,780
I've got you covered, Kofi!

2723
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:40,720
Keep going!

2724
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,540
Pay attention to me or I'll be the center of the attention.

2725
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,240
I'll get hurt.

2726
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,040
Alright.

2727
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:47,660
Right side.

2728
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:50,100
Okay, center.

2729
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:52,520
Ow.

2730
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,880
Is it desync or something?

2731
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:57,320
What the fuck?

2732
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:59,080
How do I get across from that?

2733
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:00,260
Wait, there's something here.

2734
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:01,500
Oh yeah, there is.

2735
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,020
Okay, ready?

2736
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,320
Yeah, I'm ready.

2737
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:06,340
Go.

2738
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:08,820
Keep going.

2739
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,320
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2740
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:12,440
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2741
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:15,440
Oh, we have to move the other one.

2742
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:16,220
Trust me!

2743
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,280
I can handle it!

2744
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,340
Yeah, you have to.

2745
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:18,800
Wait.

2746
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,600
How do we get to the other side?

2747
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:22,320
You have to look at it.

2748
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:22,580
Oh wait!

2749
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:23,680
You have to go look at it.

2750
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:24,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2751
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,840
That light is the platform.

2752
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:28,120
Alright.

2753
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,240
Come on, be faster than me.

2754
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:33,180
Oh.

2755
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,880
Is there desync or something?

2756
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:36,620
What's going on?

2757
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:38,040
I have no idea.

2758
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:39,960
Where's your other light?

2759
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,100
Okay, stay right there.

2760
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:43,640
Yeah.

2761
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,520
Alright, you have to go get the left side.

2762
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:46,020
The left side.

2763
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,540
I know, this light can only go left.

2764
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,360
The red one can only go right.

2765
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,260
Oh, okay.

2766
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:52,960
And then...

2767
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:57,450
Nice.

2768
01:41:58,030 --> 01:41:58,770
I'm heading over.

2769
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:05,570
Alright, I'm going to go super fast.

2770
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:05,930
Watch this.

2771
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:08,570
Oh, now you go super fast!

2772
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:09,210
Now!

2773
01:42:10,050 --> 01:42:13,390
Alright, chase after me.

2774
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:14,050
Hey, I see a light switch!

2775
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:14,510
Hey, I see a light switch!

2776
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:16,870
Alright, turn it on.

2777
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:17,590
Now.

2778
01:42:19,470 --> 01:42:24,070
Dude, I think there was actual desync because I was on you the entire time and you still kept getting hurt.

2779
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:27,230
Yeah, yeah, because you were not on me on my screen.

2780
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:30,310
On my screen, I was directly on you.

2781
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:30,970
Yeah, but I'm host.

2782
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:32,370
I guess that's what happened with the grass too.

2783
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:33,190
Oh, that's true.

2784
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:34,130
Yeah, that should make sense.

2785
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:42,760
What the hell?

2786
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,800
Oh my god!

2787
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:46,220
Oh, you're going to sing!

2788
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,040
You know how...

2789
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,640
My taste in music is like... metal.

2790
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:52,480
Yeah.

2791
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:54,640
Um...

2792
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:56,900
Dude, I fucking love being at the barricades.

2793
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,440
But I also hate it at the same time.

2794
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,900
Won't you get pushed against it?

2795
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,640
Oh yeah, you mosh.

2796
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:02,040
Yeah.

2797
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:07,380
I only go to concerts if I can get VIP and I can like...

2798
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:11,400
enter in early to get towards the barricades or else I'm not really going.

2799
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:12,340
Now!

2800
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:14,840
Go and find an orchestra!

2801
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:18,120
Can you not encourage him, please?

2802
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:18,900
Okay, okay.

2803
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,500
If you sing.

2804
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:23,020
Oh my god!

2805
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,540
Are you ready to sing in front of everybody?

2806
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:26,280
This is it!

2807
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,360
Your hopes and dreams!

2808
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,000
I'm not a pa- Wait, is this chess?

2809
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:32,020
Is this actual chess?

2810
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:33,640
Oh my god.

2811
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,280
Oh my god, this is actual chess.

2812
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:37,280
Wait, wait.

2813
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,700
Hey, can we do...

2814
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:42,000
We're not playing fucking...

2815
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,320
We're not doing quick.

2816
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,720
There's no way.

2817
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,820
Not other... Okay.

2818
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,020
I haven't played chess in a long time.

2819
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,120
So I don't know what I'm doing.

2820
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,260
How do we make it quick?

2821
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:54,680
Oh!

2822
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,960
What if I just copy your every move?

2823
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,200
What is wrong with you?

2824
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,500
What if I just copy your...

2825
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,100
Oh my god.

2826
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:08,760
Okay.

2827
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,880
I don't know what I'm doing.

2828
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,080
I'm not thinking any steps ahead.

2829
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:16,680
I'm not either.

2830
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:17,920
I'm just moving.

2831
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:18,540
Me too.

2832
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:19,020
I just want to play.

2833
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:19,420
I just move.

2834
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,480
I just wanted to get the horse out.

2835
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:23,020
Me too!

2836
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,040
The horsey!

2837
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:26,900
The horsey!

2838
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:27,440
Ney!

2839
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:30,220
Ney!

2840
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:32,560
You want my horsey?

2841
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:33,640
Then your horsey be friends?

2842
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:36,000
Yeah.

2843
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:38,980
No.

2844
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:40,940
That's not so friendly.

2845
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:41,380
Of course.

2846
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,720
What if I don't want your horsey to be friends with my horsey?

2847
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:51,460
Hello?

2848
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,380
Can I get this one?

2849
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:01,300
Here she goes.

2850
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:04,080
Do do do do.

2851
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:07,780
I want to move this horse.

2852
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:09,860
This way.

2853
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:12,420
I wanna move my horsey.

2854
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:13,560
This way.

2855
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,000
Oh my god.

2856
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,040
They can kiss you.

2857
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:16,840
They so close.

2858
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:17,560
What the fuck?

2859
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,580
You didn't even move your horsey.

2860
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:23,200
What if they don't move like that?

2861
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:23,780
You lied to me.

2862
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,120
I hope so.

2863
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:28,580
I'm gonna make the king attack you.

2864
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:30,280
What the hell?

2865
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,140
The king is coming head over.

2866
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:44,020
But what if the king just walks up to you and just... wouldn't it be funny if I just lose my queen right here?

2867
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:49,320
That would be so fucking hilarious.

2868
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,180
If I just lose my queen right there.

2869
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:55,880
That would be so funny.

2870
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,780
I'd be like he he ha ha.

2871
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,080
I want my horse to go here.

2872
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:02,300
And I...

2873
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:04,320
I want my...

2874
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:06,520
I want my...

2875
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:11,000
my king to stay right here and just look at you.

2876
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:12,660
Alright.

2877
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:13,740
Okay.

2878
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,260
Just look at you like that.

2879
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:18,080
Just look at you.

2880
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:20,280
Okay.

2881
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,140
This one.

2882
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:22,840
A little look.

2883
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:27,580
I know he's gonna stare at you.

2884
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:28,640
Okay.

2885
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,540
He's just looking at you like that.

2886
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:36,880
And just like hello.

2887
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:39,060
Okay.

2888
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,300
Isn't that cute?

2889
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:42,080
Isn't that funny?

2890
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:44,340
I heard you the first time.

2891
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,260
Wouldn't that be so funny?

2892
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:52,800
Weren't you in the chess club or something?

2893
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:54,400
Yeah, but I don't care anymore.

2894
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,460
I don't think when I play chess anymore.

2895
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,320
Because I don't play chess anymore.

2896
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:00,760
I've never played...

2897
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:02,440
I learned how to play chess from the computer.

2898
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:05,020
I don't play chess anymore so I don't really care.

2899
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,060
You know what?

2900
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:07,060
I'm just gonna eat your horse.

2901
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,580
You can eat my pawn.

2902
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,220
But like I got your horse.

2903
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:14,900
Wait, I left my horse there because you said our horses were friends.

2904
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,260
Well, is this a horse?

2905
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:18,880
Is this a horse?

2906
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:21,780
What the hell?

2907
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:23,760
I mean, you're just gonna eat a pawn.

2908
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:24,360
So who cares?

2909
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:26,380
Whoa!

2910
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:27,260
Whoa!

2911
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:30,280
That's fucked up!

2912
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,700
Why would you do that?

2913
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:33,760
It's just a little horse.

2914
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:35,900
I won't tell you.

2915
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:37,800
Where is my king?

2916
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:41,580
Literally looking at it.

2917
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:42,840
Where's my king?

2918
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:47,040
I'm literally looking at it.

2919
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:47,580
Where's my king?

2920
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:50,480
I thought you were like, I'm gonna put my king here.

2921
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:52,720
I'm gonna put my king here so it looks at you.

2922
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,940
Because I want my king to look at you.

2923
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,340
Where is it?

2924
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,260
That's all you come saying.

2925
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:01,680
I want my king to look at you.

2926
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,100
Yeah, because I want to look at you.

2927
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,160
I want to be like...

2928
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:07,260
See, look, I exchanged my horse for your horse.

2929
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:08,360
Because I was being nice.

2930
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:10,220
I was like... Yeah, you mean?

2931
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:13,560
Yeah, I gave you my horse because I wanted to be nice.

2932
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,800
You mean that too?

2933
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:16,700
Yeah.

2934
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:18,360
What are you doing?

2935
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:18,940
Don't yawn.

2936
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:19,620
I mean, what the fuck?

2937
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:20,900
Why did you move your castle there?

2938
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:21,560
That's fucked up.

2939
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:23,800
Why did you do that?

2940
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:27,100
Why did you move your castle over there?

2941
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:27,680
That's mean.

2942
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:29,060
Because I want to.

2943
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:29,700
Why?

2944
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:30,820
Why would you want that?

2945
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,540
Because I want to.

2946
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:32,960
Why?

2947
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,500
Why would you want that though?

2948
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:38,320
Because I want to.

2949
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:38,840
Why?

2950
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,900
I forgot how to tag me.

2951
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:43,100
I forgot.

2952
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:49,020
You can't go to the stand there like that.

2953
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:49,920
What are you saying?

2954
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:52,320
I forgot how to tag me.

2955
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:53,460
I was just fucking around.

2956
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:57,320
This is supposed to be a quick game that I'm messing about.

2957
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:01,180
Oh, there's your queen over there.

2958
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:02,540
There she is.

2959
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:04,520
There she is.

2960
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:05,360
She's over here.

2961
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:09,920
Are you gonna move your bishop?

2962
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,620
Yeah, I'm moving my bishop over here.

2963
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:13,960
Okay.

2964
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:15,040
Okay.

2965
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:17,380
I'm gonna move this one.

2966
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:18,440
Not that one.

2967
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:20,140
I'm gonna move this one.

2968
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,440
And then I'm gonna move it right here.

2969
01:49:22,660 --> 01:49:23,200
Okay.

2970
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:25,300
You move over there.

2971
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:27,200
You move over there.

2972
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,240
Okay.

2973
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,100
And then I'm gonna move...

2974
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,420
I'm gonna move her...

2975
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:35,780
I'm gonna move her...

2976
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:36,320
over...

2977
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:38,060
Where do I go?

2978
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:39,940
Where do I go?

2979
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,500
You only have a minute and twenty seconds.

2980
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:45,640
I know.

2981
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:47,060
Stop me.

2982
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:48,460
I got me you son of a bitch.

2983
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:51,200
You think you're so smart.

2984
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,140
Where are you gonna move?

2985
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,940
I want my horse.

2986
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:02,840
No.

2987
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:05,340
Not here.

2988
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,200
Not here.

2989
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,320
That's fucked up.

2990
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:11,420
Why did you move over there?

2991
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:13,600
I wanted to be there.

2992
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:14,820
But why?

2993
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,800
Why did you want it to be there?

2994
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:20,200
What purpose does it give you?

2995
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:22,740
I just wanted it there.

2996
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:23,660
I'm impressed by myself.

2997
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,460
Why would you do that?

2998
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,020
No, not checked.

2999
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:27,460
I'm JK.

3000
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:28,800
What do you mean checked?

3001
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:32,940
I thought this king was over here.

3002
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,560
I wasn't looking.

3003
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:38,760
JK, hee hee.

3004
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:39,740
That was not checked.

3005
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,900
JK, I think I was just joking.

3006
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:45,800
Hee hee.

3007
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:51,720
Hee hee funny.

3008
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:54,340
Wasn't that funny that I thought that was checked?

3009
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,080
Shut up dude.

3010
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,220
Yeah, that was kind of funny.

3011
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:03,620
That was pretty hee hee.

3012
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:04,800
Yeah, that was kind of funny.

3013
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:08,480
Yeah, that was kind of funny.

3014
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,880
Yeah, that was kind of funny.

3015
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:12,100
Wasn't that hilarious?

3016
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:14,140
Yeah, that was kind of funny.

3017
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:14,440
Hee hee.

3018
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:16,460
Where do I want to go?

3019
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:18,080
Home.

3020
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,300
You don't know where to go.

3021
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:21,400
I don't know.

3022
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:26,620
Why don't you think for like one more minute?

3023
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,540
Just think for one more minute, you know?

3024
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:29,860
I think I might move home.

3025
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,120
Why did you go home?

3026
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:32,580
Just think for one more minute.

3027
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:36,180
I wanted to go home.

3028
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,260
Why did you go home?

3029
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:37,980
Just keep thinking.

3030
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,640
I wanted to.

3031
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:41,280
Hee hee.

3032
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,760
I'll go here then.

3033
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:44,200
Okay.

3034
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,860
Woah, woah, woah.

3035
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,540
Woah, woah, woah.

3036
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:49,460
Woah, woah, woah.

3037
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:52,220
Hello.

3038
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:56,320
I want to send my horse home too.

3039
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:57,940
Why are you sending your horse home?

3040
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:59,200
Your horse just wants to have fun.

3041
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:00,840
You know?

3042
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:02,860
You ate my other horse.

3043
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,560
Woah.

3044
01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:09,710
You actually have...

3045
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:11,150
10 seconds left.

3046
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:16,110
9, 8, 7, 6.

3047
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:19,890
I've said seconds.

3048
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:21,030
I can still do stuff.

3049
01:52:21,930 --> 01:52:23,330
Okay, I'm putting my horse here.

3050
01:52:24,430 --> 01:52:25,030
Okay.

3051
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:26,130
I'm just gonna...

3052
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:27,870
I'm just gonna eat your pawn anyway.

3053
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:29,330
Because I have 4 seconds.

3054
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:31,710
There you go.

3055
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:33,110
That's fine.

3056
01:52:33,290 --> 01:52:33,830
That's fine.

3057
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:34,670
That's fine.

3058
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:36,270
That's fine.

3059
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:37,710
I got...

3060
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:39,210
What?

3061
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:40,930
Do you have more time?

3062
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:42,450
Wait, I thought it was like more pieces.

3063
01:52:43,050 --> 01:52:45,130
But I ate more pieces, didn't I?

3064
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,570
No.

3065
01:52:46,570 --> 01:52:47,130
I have more time.

3066
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:48,050
Didn't I eat more pieces?

3067
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:51,230
Wait, it's...

3068
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:54,650
It's like whoever runs out of time...

3069
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,410
Oh!

3070
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:57,090
You need to lose.

3071
01:52:57,110 --> 01:52:58,770
Oh my god, it's Heaven's Gate.

3072
01:52:59,450 --> 01:53:00,390
Oh shit.

3073
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,330
Your singing's not that good.

3074
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:04,730
The fuck?

3075
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:10,910
Oh, it's time or checkmate.

3076
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:13,610
Oh, it's time or checkmate.

3077
01:53:13,610 --> 01:53:14,510
Oh, it's time or checkmate.

3078
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:16,050
Oh, more instruments.

3079
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:16,770
Oh, more instruments.

3080
01:53:16,770 --> 01:53:20,350
Yeah, you just got beat by a person who learned how to play from a computer.

3081
01:53:20,970 --> 01:53:23,270
All this stuff brings back some good memories.

3082
01:53:23,290 --> 01:53:24,570
From running out of time.

3083
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:26,970
That is... wait, were we out of heaven?

3084
01:53:27,250 --> 01:53:28,790
Bro, that was fast.

3085
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:32,710
We're not in heaven anymore apparently.

3086
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:34,670
There's a...

3087
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:35,470
What's this?

3088
01:53:35,890 --> 01:53:39,130
Yeah, but don't drink the wine.

3089
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:41,270
Don't drink the wine.

3090
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:43,450
Wow, that's a lot of wine.

3091
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:44,370
You're a wine mom.

3092
01:53:45,210 --> 01:53:46,190
Oh, there's a picture.

3093
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:47,630
I don't like wine that much.

3094
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:50,150
Wait, wait, wait.

3095
01:53:51,010 --> 01:53:52,010
Where is it?

3096
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:16,380
Look at that!

3097
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,520
I can play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star!

3098
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,780
I thought you were playing Mary Had a Little Lamb.

3099
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,520
Oh, it's actually the same tune.

3100
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:25,400
Mary Had a...

3101
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:27,320
Isn't it Twinkle... no, there's like...

3102
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,980
Row, row, row your boat.

3103
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,420
Gently down the stream.

3104
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:34,760
There's like... there's like tunes that are like basically the same tune.

3105
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:36,340
And then it's like...

3106
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:38,900
What are you doing?

3107
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:40,600
I'm waiting for you.

3108
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:48,400
How do I get there?

3109
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:50,020
Go down.

3110
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:51,260
Go down?

3111
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:53,460
Oh, you're downstairs!

3112
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,800
I thought you were above me.

3113
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:58,500
No.

3114
01:54:58,960 --> 01:54:59,880
There's something here.

3115
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:00,160
No.

3116
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:02,740
But I'm over here.

3117
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:05,140
And now I'm over here.

3118
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:07,940
Now I'm back.

3119
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:10,980
Alright, I'm ready.

3120
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,180
Yay!

3121
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:13,600
Yippee!

3122
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:19,060
We're so smart together.

3123
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,040
What did that do?

3124
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:21,600
I don't know.

3125
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:25,600
Oh, I sent you the vines.

3126
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:28,720
Oh!

3127
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:29,300
Oh!

3128
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:29,900
Oh!

3129
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:33,120
Yes, sir.

3130
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:34,020
Yes, sir.

3131
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:36,460
Three bags full.

3132
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:37,680
What the fuck?

3133
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:38,700
Whoa, what's this?

3134
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:39,740
You have an accordion?

3135
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:40,660
Oh!

3136
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:41,880
It kills you.

3137
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:44,180
What's that machine?

3138
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,520
Looks like some kind of accordion.

3139
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,700
How do we fucking...

3140
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:49,240
Do you sing... can you sing against it?

3141
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:50,840
Oh, I can shield!

3142
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:53,420
Guys, remember when I have a shield?

3143
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:54,000
I got this.

3144
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:55,220
Follow me.

3145
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,060
M'lady.

3146
01:55:57,660 --> 01:55:58,620
M'lady.

3147
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:00,120
You have to stand behind my shield.

3148
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,240
I'm worth something now.

3149
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:05,120
Oh!

3150
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:05,960
Oh my god!

3151
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:06,800
That's sick!

3152
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:07,340
I'm blocked!

3153
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:09,140
Right side.

3154
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:10,580
Right side.

3155
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:11,120
To the right.

3156
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:11,800
To the right.

3157
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:12,600
Here we go.

3158
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:12,900
We're good.

3159
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:14,960
We just run past it.

3160
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,080
Chivalry is not dead, exactly.

3161
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:20,980
But some...

3162
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:22,780
I don't even need her to say thank you.

3163
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:26,780
I mean, it would be nice, you know?

3164
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:27,860
I mean, it would be nice, you know?

3165
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:28,420
Don't you say so?

3166
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,180
Oh, yeah.

3167
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:30,960
To the left side.

3168
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:35,380
Left!

3169
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:35,820
Left!

3170
01:56:36,860 --> 01:56:37,260
Right!

3171
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:39,440
Right!

3172
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:42,040
Okay, I got it.

3173
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,840
It should stay open now.

3174
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:48,020
Yeah.

3175
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:51,060
Here I go.

3176
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:54,920
Here I go.

3177
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:55,540
I'm going to wait for you.

3178
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:57,940
Wee!

3179
01:56:57,940 --> 01:56:58,760
No, I don't.

3180
01:56:58,760 --> 01:56:59,800
I can just be here.

3181
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,880
Oh, I need to go to the other side.

3182
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,160
May!

3183
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:05,660
You need to jump off my head.

3184
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:09,420
The final stop.

3185
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:15,450
I don't need the little notes come off the paper.

3186
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:16,350
Oh, yeah!

3187
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:17,170
That's so cute!

3188
01:57:17,370 --> 01:57:17,850
I like that.

3189
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:19,710
Yay!

3190
01:57:22,570 --> 01:57:23,930
Where the fuck are we?

3191
01:57:23,930 --> 01:57:25,010
Are we in a cello or something?

3192
01:57:26,410 --> 01:57:28,130
How much music do you play?

3193
01:57:28,770 --> 01:57:30,650
How do we have all these instruments?

3194
01:57:31,230 --> 01:57:33,870
How do we have all these instruments?

3195
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:35,130
Are we back in music heaven?

3196
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:38,190
Dude, why the fuck are we in heaven?

3197
01:57:39,050 --> 01:57:39,530
Dude, why the fuck are we in heaven?

3198
01:57:39,530 --> 01:57:40,930
Because we're good people?

3199
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:43,230
Well, obviously I think I'm a good person.

3200
01:57:43,310 --> 01:57:44,210
I gave you my pass.

3201
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:46,410
I gave you my plus one.

3202
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:49,310
Okay, sure.

3203
01:57:50,890 --> 01:57:52,470
Lying is a sin, you know.

3204
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:53,090
Lying is a sin, you know.

3205
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:53,730
Yeah.

3206
01:57:53,930 --> 01:57:55,890
That's why I gave you my pass.

3207
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:57,590
And why you're not in heaven.

3208
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:06,540
What?

3209
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:13,080
What kind of concert is this?

3210
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:14,340
I thought this was a pop concert.

3211
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:15,540
They've been kidnapped?

3212
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,320
Like the devils?

3213
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:28,180
You have to go and save the orchestra!

3214
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:29,320
Go?

3215
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:29,940
How?

3216
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,100
We don't walk on clouds!

3217
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:35,120
Aren't we technically walking on...

3218
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:35,860
Oh, okay.

3219
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:37,920
I thought we were already on clouds.

3220
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:38,640
Now you can.

3221
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:39,900
Go, go, go!

3222
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:41,900
Alright.

3223
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:44,280
Time to kill the devils!

3224
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:45,820
Wait, but where do we go?

3225
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:48,680
Go here?

3226
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:50,680
Oh my god, there's flying pigs!

3227
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:52,600
Oh my god, when pigs fly!

3228
01:58:53,940 --> 01:58:55,440
But what are the music notes for?

3229
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,460
Oh, we have to get all the music notes!

3230
01:58:59,460 --> 01:58:59,900
Oh, we have to get all the music notes!

3231
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:02,380
Why do I get the cutscene and you don't?

3232
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:03,120
Why do I get the cutscene and you don't?

3233
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:04,620
I got the cutscene before you!

3234
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:07,120
Wait, then why do I have to watch it again?

3235
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:07,660
Wait, then why do I have to watch it again?

3236
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:09,380
Alright, just a few more bubbles to pop!

3237
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:12,180
Once you pop, you can't stop!

3238
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:14,400
We get all the ones here?

3239
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:15,360
No, we're missing one.

3240
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:18,300
Oh, it's up here.

3241
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,620
I got one of the doors up.

3242
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:23,720
Oh my god, I see the devils!

3243
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:25,020
Come on!

3244
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:26,680
Come on!

3245
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:29,160
Wait, can I kill the pigs?

3246
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:32,640
Oh my god!

3247
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:33,240
Stop!

3248
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:35,120
Wait, there's tennis!

3249
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:35,620
There's tennis!

3250
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:39,800
Oh, volleyball!

3251
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:41,440
I love volleyball!

3252
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:43,960
Okay, jump is nice.

3253
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:45,780
Why, it scared you?

3254
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,080
Oh my god, look!

3255
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,000
It's a devil bat!

3256
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:50,600
Yeah, it's a devil bat!

3257
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:52,300
It's a devil and a pig.

3258
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:54,180
The angels are pigs?

3259
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:57,640
That's funny.

3260
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:58,540
The angels are pigs.

3261
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,040
Wait, this is not real volleyball!

3262
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,800
This is not regular volleyball!

3263
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:06,860
How dare they tarnish volleyball!

3264
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:10,600
I can't believe it.

3265
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:11,420
Not my volleyball.

3266
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:12,720
What?!

3267
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:15,520
Okay.

3268
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,240
Not my volleyball.

3269
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:21,220
Oh my god.

3270
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:22,580
Dude!

3271
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,080
I know, it gets confusing when there's two.

3272
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:31,370
Nice.

3273
02:00:32,690 --> 02:00:33,210
Alright.

3274
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:34,890
Woo!

3275
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:35,510
Woo!

3276
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:36,590
Yeah!

3277
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:39,570
I wish you made it more clear that you were under it.

3278
02:00:41,410 --> 02:00:42,250
It's like...

3279
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:43,470
It's so weird.

3280
02:00:43,650 --> 02:00:46,770
Because it's hard to see where the ball is going to land too.

3281
02:00:47,290 --> 02:00:48,290
I think that's like...

3282
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:49,490
the more frustrating part.

3283
02:00:49,490 --> 02:00:50,330
Yeah.

3284
02:00:51,050 --> 02:00:51,530
It's...

3285
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:54,890
What?!

3286
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:56,290
That was clear!

3287
02:01:04,770 --> 02:01:06,930
I hate this game.

3288
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:10,610
It ruined volleyball for me.

3289
02:01:13,470 --> 02:01:15,490
I'm a tailpull!

3290
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:16,710
I told you!

3291
02:01:17,150 --> 02:01:18,010
This sucks!

3292
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:20,130
What?!

3293
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:21,470
You got tailpulled!

3294
02:01:21,470 --> 02:01:23,550
You get to hit balls?!

3295
02:01:26,150 --> 02:01:27,570
Nice kill!

3296
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:29,510
Oh god.

3297
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:30,670
Bro.

3298
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:32,330
It's getting harder.

3299
02:01:32,570 --> 02:01:33,630
It's going harder.

3300
02:01:36,730 --> 02:01:37,730
What?!

3301
02:01:40,690 --> 02:01:41,690
Okay.

3302
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:43,630
Oh,

3303
02:01:48,460 --> 02:01:49,340
out of here!

3304
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:50,700
Oh god.

3305
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:52,440
No!

3306
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:53,980
Bro!

3307
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:56,200
The dog!

3308
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:57,800
Oh, it's breaking the game!

3309
02:01:58,720 --> 02:01:59,840
This is it.

3310
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:02,020
Dude, fuck these pigs.

3311
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,700
Down with all the angel pigs!

3312
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:11,700
Come on!

3313
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,240
Where are they?

3314
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:16,540
I'm coming over!

3315
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:20,160
I'm coming over!

3316
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:21,440
I'm coming over!

3317
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:21,800
No!

3318
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:22,880
I can't kill him!

3319
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:25,960
Where are you adorable pigs?

3320
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,560
I'm coming over!

3321
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,200
No, I can't get rid of them.

3322
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:33,740
I'll pet you.

3323
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,160
I guess I'll pet you.

3324
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:37,640
Wait, they're not pigs!

3325
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:39,260
They're like little hamsters.

3326
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:41,060
Yeah, what the heck?

3327
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:41,500
Yeah!

3328
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:45,100
They're little hamsters.

3329
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:46,540
Oh my god, his face is so cute!

3330
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:49,340
Look at his little paws!

3331
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,760
Yeah, he has little paw pads too.

3332
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:55,540
He's not gonna stop me from eliminating him.

3333
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:56,200
I can pet this one too.

3334
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:56,780
Stop!

3335
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:02,140
They ruined volleyball!

3336
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:04,980
They didn't do shit!

3337
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,660
They ruined volleyball!

3338
02:03:06,980 --> 02:03:08,120
We're the devils!

3339
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,060
I'm waiting for you on the other side.

3340
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:16,460
Well, I'm clearing out the music net so we can just get out of the way.

3341
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:19,260
We're gonna head there eventually anyway.

3342
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,900
I'm right here with the devil here.

3343
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:22,740
I'm right here with the devil here.

3344
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,460
Oh yeah, get that KD ratio up.

3345
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:25,800
You're right.

3346
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:30,280
You sweet... you're a fucking dick.

3347
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:36,040
Oh, woah, why do they have faces?

3348
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:37,660
Where's the orchestra?

3349
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:40,900
Bro, ugh.

3350
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:43,180
We'll never find them!

3351
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,380
Guy?

3352
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:46,100
That one's throwing ass.

3353
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:50,200
Oh!

3354
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,680
Sorry, Cloud.

3355
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:52,600
My bad.

3356
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:54,080
No, wait!

3357
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:55,300
Look!

3358
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:56,720
He's crying!

3359
02:03:58,860 --> 02:04:00,000
Are those our...

3360
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,040
guys?

3361
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:06,100
Those voice actors are so...

3362
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:08,340
I feel like I know them.

3363
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:09,320
The voice actors.

3364
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:11,680
They're so recognizable.

3365
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:18,480
So I just have to beat up the clouds.

3366
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:19,180
That's easy.

3367
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:22,380
Okay.

3368
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:23,760
Sorry, Clouds!

3369
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:26,000
You need your tears to clear the fog!

3370
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:27,660
Don't worry.

3371
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:30,220
I'm making them all cry!

3372
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:31,160
They like it!

3373
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:32,520
They're tears of joy!

3374
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:35,740
Oh, I pushed the clouds over!

3375
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:37,960
Oh, you pushed them over!

3376
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,820
So I've been beating up for no reason.

3377
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:47,280
Stop beating this one's ass, dude!

3378
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,660
I just look over and this is Cloud's extra size!

3379
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:53,720
I just look over and this is Cloud's extra size!

3380
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:55,360
What if they like it?

3381
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:56,260
You don't know that!

3382
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,540
Is that why they're crying and look so sad?

3383
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:00,800
They like it!

3384
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:03,220
They're tears of jo- Okay, it's like those like...

3385
02:05:03,220 --> 02:05:04,600
They're tears of joy!

3386
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:10,320
I'm pretty sure I just heard this one say, Oh no, no, no!

3387
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,840
I think you're supposed to move them around so like...

3388
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,740
we- it clears the fog, right?

3389
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:19,620
Yeah.

3390
02:05:19,700 --> 02:05:21,800
I'm pretty sure you're supposed to- All the fogs?

3391
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:23,620
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're supposed to clear the fog.

3392
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:26,580
Yeah, see?

3393
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,760
Do you hear it?

3394
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,920
It's going- Tears of happiness.

3395
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:34,060
I hear those tears of happiness right there.

3396
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:35,760
Oh, there it is!

3397
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:39,500
We have to- Here, here!

3398
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:44,230
There they are!

3399
02:05:44,330 --> 02:05:44,570
There they are!

3400
02:05:46,230 --> 02:05:47,030
We gotta beat them!

3401
02:05:47,090 --> 02:05:47,670
Beat them up!

3402
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:48,110
Beat them up!

3403
02:05:50,350 --> 02:05:50,830
Here we go.

3404
02:05:50,890 --> 02:05:51,170
I got one!

3405
02:05:51,590 --> 02:05:52,410
Where's the last guy?

3406
02:05:52,570 --> 02:05:52,830
I got two.

3407
02:05:54,370 --> 02:05:55,270
Where's the last one?

3408
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:56,750
Was there three?

3409
02:05:59,430 --> 02:06:00,450
I thought there was three.

3410
02:06:00,570 --> 02:06:01,290
No, there was only two!

3411
02:06:01,490 --> 02:06:02,410
Cause they had two keys.

3412
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:02,810
Oh!

3413
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:04,430
But where's the key then?

3414
02:06:04,630 --> 02:06:06,750
I think we have to get the cloud thing up.

3415
02:06:07,490 --> 02:06:10,510
I think we have to make sure the fog is still clear.

3416
02:06:13,930 --> 02:06:15,390
Cause I don't see any keys.

3417
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:23,530
Where the fuck- Don't worry, I got you.

3418
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:26,190
Oh my god.

3419
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:27,650
He looks so miserable.

3420
02:06:27,970 --> 02:06:28,970
He looks so happy.

3421
02:06:29,010 --> 02:06:29,570
Oh, there it is!

3422
02:06:29,890 --> 02:06:31,010
I knew there was one more.

3423
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:35,410
Yeah, there's the other one!

3424
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:38,350
I got it!

3425
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,720
Wait, where's the other key then?

3426
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:49,300
Wait, where's the other key then?

3427
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:50,520
Wait, do you have- Do you have one on the floor somewhere?

3428
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:52,620
Yeah, you must have dropped it on the floor.

3429
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:53,220
Yeah, you must have dropped it on the floor.

3430
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:57,260
Cause where is it?

3431
02:06:58,640 --> 02:06:59,800
Where's the last key?

3432
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,440
It has to be like in the fog somewhere.

3433
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:05,780
Oh wait!

3434
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:06,400
There's a guy!

3435
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:08,320
Oh, there he is!

3436
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,820
I didn't even see him.

3437
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:15,980
Do I have it?

3438
02:07:21,380 --> 02:07:21,900
Stop!

3439
02:07:27,070 --> 02:07:28,550
Dragoon, you like that Dragoon?

3440
02:07:29,630 --> 02:07:31,150
What the heck?

3441
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:34,390
Get over here!

3442
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:36,530
I'm here!

3443
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:51,220
Let me save one of them.

3444
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:52,340
Let me get the other half of the orchestra.

3445
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:54,820
You think they're dead people?

3446
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:57,740
We are in heaven.

3447
02:07:58,580 --> 02:08:01,240
Oh my god, that could be Mozart right there!

3448
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:03,220
Let's get to the other side!

3449
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:04,860
Yeah, we could've had Beethoven!

3450
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:05,740
We could've had Beethoven!

3451
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,920
I actually call him Motsi.

3452
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:09,600
You're that close?

3453
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:10,460
Yeah, yeah.

3454
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:11,900
Beethoven, call him Bebe.

3455
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:18,920
What?

3456
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:21,940
I heard it blow up!

3457
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:26,540
He's like, he's in heaven!

3458
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:28,780
So like technically he's still alive.

3459
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:33,320
Yeah, excuse me.

3460
02:08:34,580 --> 02:08:35,060
Devils?

3461
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:39,340
Yeah, we're gonna need to borrow that orchestra that you got locked up in there.

3462
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:44,140
We will never let them out!

3463
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:49,940
I'm glad you also noticed that.

3464
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:50,440
Yeah, yeah.

3465
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:52,500
Woah!

3466
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:56,780
We could just beat up all of them.

3467
02:08:58,060 --> 02:09:00,140
Okay, but what if we just hit everything?

3468
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:01,220
Okay, but what if we just hit everything?

3469
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:12,180
Yeah, if I kill everybody, then we win.

3470
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:12,520
Yeah, if I kill everybody, then we win.

3471
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:12,640
Yeah, if I kill everybody, then we win.

3472
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:14,440
Here, I got the key one.

3473
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:15,060
I got the key.

3474
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,380
Oh, I've just been killing all of them.

3475
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:18,160
Yeah, me too honestly.

3476
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:22,000
Okay, I'll grab this one though.

3477
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:25,000
Woah, wait, they can steal from you?

3478
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:26,180
Bro, that's fucked up!

3479
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:27,700
Don't worry, I got another one.

3480
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:31,080
That's fucked up as we're killing all of them?

3481
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:34,460
Yeah, we're killing all your friends and family and you're just gonna focus on the key?

3482
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,000
Yeah, we're killing all your friends and family and you're just gonna focus on the key?

3483
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:37,700
Yeah, wait, you already killed them.

3484
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:42,280
I like how we killed all of them instead of the actual person with the key.

3485
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:45,000
Well, they were gonna steal it anyways.

3486
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:49,800
We did it!

3487
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:53,280
Oh.

3488
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:58,760
Why don't you say anything?

3489
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:00,560
We're supposed to be a team!

3490
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:04,740
We're supposed to be a team!

3491
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:05,880
It looked like you were having fun.

3492
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:07,780
Yay!

3493
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,020
Now we save Chopin!

3494
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:14,120
Oh my god, reminds me of Sound of Music.

3495
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:17,760
Is that it?

3496
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:19,080
Now we need to get the Maestro.

3497
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:20,560
You're the Maestro.

3498
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:21,820
That's the whole of the thing.

3499
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:26,200
I wonder if I can die.

3500
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:28,960
Wait.

3501
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:30,460
I'm gonna test the theory.

3502
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,960
I'm gonna test the theory.

3503
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:35,580
I'm gonna test the theory.

3504
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:37,040
You can die.

3505
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:42,200
Look, it's all about experimentation.

3506
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:44,540
Leave it alone!

3507
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:46,680
Wait,

3508
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:50,980
what?

3509
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:51,940
What did I do?

3510
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:55,040
Dude, I'm so glad I saw one more on your screen too.

3511
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:59,360
I just didn't want to tell you.

3512
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:01,020
It'll be fine.

3513
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:02,520
No, no, no, no, no.

3514
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:04,240
It will not be fine.

3515
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:05,720
He gets to go to double heaven.

3516
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:08,640
It'll be fantastico!

3517
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:09,620
Hyah!

3518
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:10,420
Hyah!

3519
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:10,920
Woah!

3520
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:13,180
Woah!

3521
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:17,400
Rematch time.

3522
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:20,860
I see the chest for...

3523
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:25,800
What the fu- Good job!

3524
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,380
We're almost ready.

3525
02:11:27,620 --> 02:11:30,660
The only thing missing is...

3526
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:31,380
the audience.

3527
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:32,620
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3528
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:33,780
Not an audience.

3529
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:35,000
Hyah!

3530
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:37,280
Do you want the last letter piece or not?

3531
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,660
Hey, that's blackmail.

3532
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:39,420
No!

3533
02:11:39,580 --> 02:11:40,340
That's manipulation.

3534
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:44,350
Now go and get the fuck...

3535
02:11:44,350 --> 02:11:47,090
Blackmail in a relationship... No, but you had a point earlier.

3536
02:11:47,090 --> 02:11:48,230
is a healthy relationship.

3537
02:11:48,830 --> 02:11:51,530
I didn't get to, like, reply earlier, but you were right.

3538
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:55,190
There are some marriages that are, like, that need to be ended.

3539
02:11:55,530 --> 02:11:55,930
Yeah.

3540
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:58,450
Like, you can't fix all marriages.

3541
02:11:58,790 --> 02:11:59,830
This is one of them.

3542
02:12:02,630 --> 02:12:03,950
Oh my god.

3543
02:12:03,950 --> 02:12:05,110
Oh my god, VIP!

3544
02:12:06,270 --> 02:12:06,950
We're VIP!

3545
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:07,750
That's us!

3546
02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:08,850
Let us in!

3547
02:12:08,950 --> 02:12:09,590
Let us in!

3548
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:10,910
Hey, buddy, over here!

3549
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:12,370
What's up?

3550
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:13,910
Can you let us in?

3551
02:12:14,490 --> 02:12:15,170
Sorry, kids.

3552
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:16,110
No minors.

3553
02:12:16,330 --> 02:12:16,770
Kids?

3554
02:12:17,130 --> 02:12:18,250
No, no, no, no.

3555
02:12:18,350 --> 02:12:19,470
We're just, uh... Yeah.

3556
02:12:19,930 --> 02:12:21,550
We're small in size, that's all.

3557
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:22,730
I can't believe it.

3558
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:23,950
Just cause we're small?

3559
02:12:24,530 --> 02:12:24,650
Get out of here, you dosed.

3560
02:12:25,310 --> 02:12:27,230
Excuse me, we are adults.

3561
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:28,750
You have some ID?

3562
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:30,630
Oh, uh, no.

3563
02:12:30,750 --> 02:12:31,830
We left it at home.

3564
02:12:32,610 --> 02:12:34,150
That's what they all say.

3565
02:12:34,830 --> 02:12:35,630
Yo, yo!

3566
02:12:36,350 --> 02:12:36,910

02:12:37,190 --> 02:12:38,150
There with me!

3568
02:12:38,430 --> 02:12:40,150
Dr. Akeem, my bro!

3569
02:12:40,390 --> 02:12:41,170
There with you?

3570
02:12:41,630 --> 02:12:43,970
God, douchebags stick together.

3571
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:45,750
Sorry about that.

3572
02:12:46,810 --> 02:12:48,050
Welcome to the club.

3573
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:49,210
Enjoy the evening.

3574
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:51,210
VIP's coming through.

3575
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:54,190
Not so cocky anymore, are ya?

3576
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:54,590
Huh?

3577
02:12:54,610 --> 02:12:55,090
Huh?

3578
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:57,910
Yeah, fucking yell at the body.

3579
02:12:58,170 --> 02:12:59,890
Yell at the fucking bouncer.

3580
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:01,250
That's a good idea.

3581
02:13:02,790 --> 02:13:03,850
That's you, man.

3582
02:13:03,870 --> 02:13:04,350
Oh my god, Rainbow Road!

3583
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:08,330
The tender's coming.

3584
02:13:09,930 --> 02:13:10,450
What?

3585
02:13:13,710 --> 02:13:14,930
Here we go.

3586
02:13:15,550 --> 02:13:16,010
This is surreal.

3587
02:13:17,010 --> 02:13:17,930
I call left.

3588
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:20,950
It's already going right, man.

3589
02:13:21,190 --> 02:13:21,610
I call left.

3590
02:13:24,930 --> 02:13:26,490
Oh my god, it is!

3591
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:28,370
It's literally Mario Kart!

3592
02:13:28,810 --> 02:13:31,230
They're like, if you fall off, you get the...

3593
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:31,730
Wait a minute.

3594
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:32,450
Yeah, look!

3595
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:34,470
Oh my god!

3596
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:36,750
I'm telling you, Ten.

3597
02:13:39,650 --> 02:13:41,270
Pal world and now this?

3598
02:13:43,370 --> 02:13:44,990
Statistics, do they never learn?

3599
02:13:50,030 --> 02:13:51,110
Who to the left?

3600
02:13:51,850 --> 02:13:52,190
Where?

3601
02:13:53,370 --> 02:13:56,070
Everything you own in a box to the left.

3602
02:13:56,110 --> 02:13:56,170
Catch up, ladies!

3603
02:13:56,330 --> 02:13:57,230
More fun together!

3604
02:13:58,110 --> 02:13:59,190
In the bedroom.

3605
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:00,530
Please don't leave.

3606
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:02,510
Still in the front.

3607
02:14:04,230 --> 02:14:05,190
What the fuck?

3608
02:14:05,290 --> 02:14:07,430
I died to experience it, man.

3609
02:14:08,550 --> 02:14:10,170
No one told you to die.

3610
02:14:10,590 --> 02:14:11,270
Come on.

3611
02:14:12,490 --> 02:14:14,570
You could have just looked at my screen.

3612
02:14:14,990 --> 02:14:16,230
I don't screen peek.

3613
02:14:16,490 --> 02:14:18,410
Yeah, yeah, you don't screen peek.

3614
02:14:18,490 --> 02:14:20,270
You've been screen peeking since we started.

3615
02:14:21,530 --> 02:14:23,250
Oh my god, that's scary.

3616
02:14:23,630 --> 02:14:27,150
Yeah, or else you're gonna be like, Oh, Goomy, where's my context clues?

3617
02:14:30,570 --> 02:14:34,730
Oh, it's like those little, like the, the, the spring, what were they called?

3618
02:14:35,770 --> 02:14:37,550
Those little spiral things?

3619
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:39,570
In the 90s?

3620
02:14:39,650 --> 02:14:40,470
Oh, the slinkies?

3621
02:14:40,750 --> 02:14:41,490
Slinkies, yeah!

3622
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:45,870
You know there's people who do, like, play with slinkies as a job?

3623
02:14:47,350 --> 02:14:48,510
I've seen people do that.

3624
02:14:48,690 --> 02:14:50,230
Like magic tricks and stuff.

3625
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:54,010
Like, have you seen like those, like, But it's like a job or something.

3626
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:56,490
Because people hire them for party entertainment.

3627
02:14:56,690 --> 02:14:57,130
Yeah.

3628
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:00,710
Slinkies?

3629
02:15:01,110 --> 02:15:01,650
Yeah!

3630
02:15:01,790 --> 02:15:04,270
I saw like a fucking YouTube short of it.

3631
02:15:04,410 --> 02:15:09,890
They, like, people, like, They get hired or some shit to like, Do like slinky tricks.

3632
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:12,690
Yeah, slinky artists.

3633
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:14,470
What the fuck?

3634
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:15,990
Why am I stuck on this side?

3635
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:20,290
Oh god, this is really annoying.

3636
02:15:25,550 --> 02:15:26,090
Okay.

3637
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:28,690
This is so annoying.

3638
02:15:28,710 --> 02:15:29,130
Actually.

3639
02:15:33,730 --> 02:15:36,050
Yeah, anything can be a job if there's a demand.

3640
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:36,810
That's true.

3641
02:15:39,690 --> 02:15:41,750
Come for me, you're a lovely husband.

3642
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:46,130
I need to press that?

3643
02:15:50,690 --> 02:15:52,230
Are you fucking...

3644
02:15:52,230 --> 02:15:52,510
Really?

3645
02:15:53,290 --> 02:15:55,470
He opened that and you're all about me?

3646
02:15:57,210 --> 02:15:58,610
Oh, I need you there.

3647
02:15:59,130 --> 02:16:00,410
Open, open, open sesame!

3648
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:01,010
Open sesame!

3649
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:01,550
Open sesame!

3650
02:16:03,270 --> 02:16:03,750
Oh...

3651
02:16:05,870 --> 02:16:07,290
I watched it, please.

3652
02:16:09,190 --> 02:16:10,510
I'm here anyway.

3653
02:16:13,890 --> 02:16:14,610
What's this?

3654
02:16:16,150 --> 02:16:16,630
What's this?

3655
02:16:17,290 --> 02:16:17,770
What's this?

3656
02:16:17,890 --> 02:16:19,510
Where in the area that they like...

3657
02:16:20,210 --> 02:16:21,170
Make the...

3658
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:23,690
Make the disco ball.

3659
02:16:24,590 --> 02:16:25,450
Yeah, with the disco ball.

3660
02:16:25,470 --> 02:16:25,850
I can do this to you.

3661
02:16:27,090 --> 02:16:27,570
Boom.

3662
02:16:30,290 --> 02:16:31,390
Oh my god.

3663
02:16:31,610 --> 02:16:32,690
Wait, no, my symbol!

3664
02:16:32,970 --> 02:16:33,830
Forget it, Cody!

3665
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:34,570
No!

3666
02:16:34,850 --> 02:16:35,330
My lady!

3667
02:16:36,870 --> 02:16:38,230
Move it, move it!

3668
02:16:39,150 --> 02:16:40,550
Dance dance, Cody!

3669
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:42,370
Do I have to move anywhere?

3670
02:16:42,690 --> 02:16:43,210
Oh, wait.

3671
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:44,650
Wait, I don't.

3672
02:16:44,750 --> 02:16:45,490
No, I do!

3673
02:16:47,250 --> 02:16:49,010
I thought you just stand there.

3674
02:16:49,130 --> 02:16:52,090
I thought you learned from the first time, but you just didn't.

3675
02:16:53,070 --> 02:16:54,330
I couldn't tell.

3676
02:16:55,830 --> 02:16:57,110
My perception.

3677
02:16:57,130 --> 02:16:59,010
My depth perception was off.

3678
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:01,770
Because he's moving still.

3679
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:04,470
So I assume he's moving for me.

3680
02:17:05,570 --> 02:17:08,030
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

3681
02:17:08,330 --> 02:17:08,970
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

3682
02:17:09,230 --> 02:17:09,870
Woo!

3683
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:13,270
Holy shit, how long is this road?

3684
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:15,690
I thought we just had to do...

3685
02:17:15,690 --> 02:17:15,730
Oh!

3686
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:19,350
I thought... Oh shit!

3687
02:17:19,450 --> 02:17:21,110
I thought we just had to do an orchestra.

3688
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:26,230
Why is your hobby and passion so long and complicated?

3689
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:29,030
Oh my god!

3690
02:17:29,350 --> 02:17:30,830
Oh, it's okay.

3691
02:17:30,890 --> 02:17:31,450
You're still alive.

3692
02:17:31,590 --> 02:17:31,970
Oh, it's okay.

3693
02:17:32,090 --> 02:17:32,750
I'll just wait.

3694
02:17:35,010 --> 02:17:35,990
You can do this.

3695
02:17:36,090 --> 02:17:36,870
I believe in you.

3696
02:17:41,970 --> 02:17:45,250
When you don't press anything, it auto-presses for you.

3697
02:17:45,370 --> 02:17:46,090
I know.

3698
02:17:46,210 --> 02:17:49,130
I've heard that one time you kept dying on purpose.

3699
02:17:51,310 --> 02:17:52,230
Not even on purpose.

3700
02:17:52,230 --> 02:17:53,350
I remember you just kept dying!

3701
02:17:56,570 --> 02:17:57,990
Check this place out.

3702
02:17:58,190 --> 02:17:59,390
Wow, this is cool.

3703
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:01,610
Wow, this is cool.

3704
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:03,610
Wait, this is Da Punk!

3705
02:18:04,810 --> 02:18:06,310
Oh, look at our line trails!

3706
02:18:07,350 --> 02:18:08,630
There's colors behind us.

3707
02:18:08,870 --> 02:18:10,490
You know this script hands down the weirdest experience of my life?

3708
02:18:10,710 --> 02:18:11,830
What's that one movie?

3709
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:13,170
I'm glad I didn't have to do it alone.

3710
02:18:13,170 --> 02:18:13,290
What?

3711
02:18:13,510 --> 02:18:13,950
Tron.

3712
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:15,050
Yeah, Tron!

3713
02:18:15,050 --> 02:18:15,830
I love Tron.

3714
02:18:15,890 --> 02:18:16,710
They're making a sequel.

3715
02:18:17,330 --> 02:18:18,470
I never watched it.

3716
02:18:20,150 --> 02:18:21,030
Why not?

3717
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:21,630
A jellyfish!

3718
02:18:22,550 --> 02:18:24,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

3719
02:18:24,550 --> 02:18:25,790
This is trippy.

3720
02:18:26,010 --> 02:18:26,930
Wait, where's the jellyfish?

3721
02:18:27,390 --> 02:18:27,690
No!

3722
02:18:29,790 --> 02:18:32,570
I was looking at the fucking glow!

3723
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:36,930
Oh my god!

3724
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:43,200
That's mean when I go to my concert.

3725
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:46,760
Oh!

3726
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:52,320
They don't like us?

3727
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:53,460
What do we do?

3728
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:54,240
Stop the music.

3729
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:55,840
Okay, baby!

3730
02:18:56,060 --> 02:18:56,620
Groovin'!

3731
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:58,780
No, they're leaving!

3732
02:18:59,620 --> 02:19:01,120
We're killing the vibes!

3733
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:02,840
Can't be me.

3734
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:04,380
I like Da Punk.

3735
02:19:04,820 --> 02:19:05,100
Play some music!

3736
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:06,140
Make them dance!

3737
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:09,300
Maybe they will if you leave the dance floor.

3738
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:10,000
Yeah, dude.

3739
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:10,540
Seriously.

3740
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:11,660
I think you're scaring them.

3741
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:12,780
No way, baby!

3742
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:13,780
I'm killing it!

3743
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:15,620
Can't you see my hip gyration?

3744
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:17,960
Please stop.

3745
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:20,040
Not again!

3746
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:21,420
Oh my god!

3747
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:23,800
Look at this!

3748
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:26,120
Right, left, right, left, left!

3749
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:26,240
But!

3750
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:31,300
To make the audience dance, you need to play the music!

3751
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:33,640
Get the audience on the floor!

3752
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,080
Let's DJ, baby!

3753
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:37,020
I don't know.

3754
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:42,160
If this guy tells me to say all that, I don't think I want to be at the club anymore.

3755
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,180
I don't think I want to be at the club anymore.

3756
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:43,280
Ehh.

3757
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:46,040
How do we do this?

3758
02:19:46,300 --> 02:19:47,560
Let's figure out this DJ thing!

3759
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:48,140
Oh!

3760
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:50,580
Do it!

3761
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:51,360
Make them dance!

3762
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:54,000
That's it!

3763
02:19:54,260 --> 02:19:55,340
You just spin the thing?

3764
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:56,740
Oh my god!

3765
02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:57,520
That's all they need?

3766
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:58,580
A fog machine?

3767
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:01,840
So they can't see what's going on in front of them?

3768
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:05,140
No consequences when you can't see!

3769
02:20:05,320 --> 02:20:05,840
Is that it?

3770
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:12,200
If there's no consequences, if you don't know what's happening...

3771
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:14,340
Oh, this one.

3772
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:14,860
You have to dance!

3773
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:16,660
You have to go to the circle and dance too!

3774
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:18,260
Oh, we have to do this.

3775
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:22,580
I'm turning the thing!

3776
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:23,940
I'm turning it!

3777
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:25,960
There you go.

3778
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:28,160
Oh my god, we're doing it!

3779
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:29,080
Now we dance!

3780
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:29,960
Look at us go!

3781
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:34,700
Oh my god, it's time to actually dance.

3782
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,140
Dance as Revolution.

3783
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,760
I used to have those dance pads.

3784
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:41,860
I had a Mario one.

3785
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:43,700
There's a Mario one?

3786
02:20:44,060 --> 02:20:45,740
Oh, we have to do all of this now.

3787
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:49,900
Oh my god.

3788
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:50,680
Defy the fire, Doki!

3789
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:51,700
Defy the fire!

3790
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:52,280
I'm trying!

3791
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:56,360
Oh no, they can see the consequences of their actions!

3792
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,100
They need more fun!

3793
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:03,740
They don't want to know what's going on!

3794
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:17,660
Yeah, DJ Cody's here.

3795
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:21,340
Yeah, it's totally not cringe.

3796
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:26,440
Oh, my god.

3797
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:27,040
Look at the crowd!

3798
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,040
They're dancing for us!

3799
02:21:30,060 --> 02:21:31,560
What the fuck?!

3800
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:34,660
What the fuck is he doing?

3801
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:37,460
What the fuck is he doing?

3802
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:37,700
That's fucked up!

3803
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:38,880
That's fucked up!

3804
02:21:43,870 --> 02:21:51,850
You spin me round You spin me round You spin me round You spin me round He plays

3805
02:21:55,710 --> 02:21:56,790
music and stuff.

3806
02:21:56,970 --> 02:21:58,590
He plays music and stuff.

3807
02:21:59,710 --> 02:22:03,350
Oh, I missed the fucking...

3808
02:22:03,350 --> 02:22:03,630
Ow!

3809
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:06,070
How do you hit all of them?

3810
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:10,230
I'm hitting the music.

3811
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:13,170
I'm riding the music.

3812
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:17,310
Oh my god, how are you so fucking fast?

3813
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:20,610
I don't know.

3814
02:22:21,070 --> 02:22:22,270
How are you doing that?

3815
02:22:22,590 --> 02:22:23,530
Are you cheating?

3816
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:26,270
What do you mean am I cheating?

3817
02:22:26,270 --> 02:22:26,450
I'm cheating!

3818
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:31,190
There's no way.

3819
02:22:31,230 --> 02:22:33,410
It can't be because I keep hitting every obstacle.

3820
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:38,290
There's no way.

3821
02:22:42,590 --> 02:22:44,770
Oh my god, I'm being a joke.

3822
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:48,190
Can't wait to see what that looks like.

3823
02:22:52,470 --> 02:22:53,510
Absolutely incredible.

3824
02:22:56,270 --> 02:22:59,010
I can't believe it made you skip ahead to the cutscene I'm at.

3825
02:22:59,530 --> 02:23:01,410
No, I just made it!

3826
02:23:06,070 --> 02:23:06,590
Whoa.

3827
02:23:06,590 --> 02:23:08,610
I was right beside you this entire time.

3828
02:23:09,290 --> 02:23:09,690
Uh-huh.

3829
02:23:15,370 --> 02:23:15,890
360.

3830
02:23:22,870 --> 02:23:24,290
Oh, that's so great.

3831
02:23:24,410 --> 02:23:24,890
Holy shit.

3832
02:23:25,030 --> 02:23:25,910
That's so great.

3833
02:23:36,750 --> 02:23:37,390
Yeah!

3834
02:23:37,390 --> 02:23:38,590
Look at that audience!

3835
02:23:38,990 --> 02:23:40,270
Dude, you kidnapped them from the club.

3836
02:23:40,670 --> 02:23:43,390
Are you ready for your performance?

3837
02:23:43,390 --> 02:23:44,590
They're just heading to the afterparty.

3838
02:23:45,130 --> 02:23:48,610
Uh, um, are we still missing something?

3839
02:23:49,030 --> 02:23:49,350
No!

3840
02:23:49,590 --> 02:23:51,410
We got everything we need!

3841
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:52,350
Everything?

3842
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:54,090
It's showtime, baby!

3843
02:23:54,410 --> 02:23:54,710
Woo!

3844
02:24:05,820 --> 02:24:07,540
You hear that, Mae?

3845
02:24:07,780 --> 02:24:09,500
You hear the anticipation?

3846
02:24:10,660 --> 02:24:13,020
I haven't performed in front of an audience for ages.

3847
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:14,280
Mae, it'll be fine.

3848
02:24:14,380 --> 02:24:16,440
Just, uh, just think of them all in their underwear.

3849
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,000
Yes.

3850
02:24:17,220 --> 02:24:18,420
That would make you relax.

3851
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:19,740
Got it.

3852
02:24:20,060 --> 02:24:21,140
Let's go prep the stage.

3853
02:24:21,380 --> 02:24:22,000
Okay, Buck.

3854
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:23,120
Hey, Mae.

3855
02:24:23,740 --> 02:24:24,440
Break a leg.

3856
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:25,620
Yeah.

3857
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:28,380
Break both legs and your arms.

3858
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:29,840
What the fuck?

3859
02:24:30,100 --> 02:24:30,320
What?

3860
02:24:30,380 --> 02:24:31,480
It's for good luck!

3861
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:33,100
I don't think so.

3862
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:35,740
The more bones you break, the more luck you get.

3863
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:37,320
That's our show business.

3864
02:24:37,780 --> 02:24:38,100
I don't know if that's true.

3865
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:40,060
Then why do you tell people to break the legs?

3866
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:41,780
Just seeing from your height.

3867
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:43,000
I don't... I don't know.

3868
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:43,300
Yeah!

3869
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:46,160
You were born to be...

3870
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:47,960
Break your arms and legs and your back.

3871
02:24:47,980 --> 02:24:49,520
You were born to be you, he said.

3872
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:11,820
Wait, is it just you?

3873
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:12,860
What the fuck?

3874
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:14,460
I don't get to play the game now?

3875
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:19,420
What about me?

3876
02:25:22,460 --> 02:25:23,320
What are you doing?

3877
02:25:27,740 --> 02:25:29,000
Flight of the Barnes.

3878
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:31,980
What would be... Oh, it would be so funny if that was to kill the Mockingjay.

3879
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:34,780
Mockingjay?

3880
02:25:35,220 --> 02:25:36,240
Yeah, Mockingbird.

3881
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:40,960
Can you only walk?

3882
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:43,880
Yeah, I can only walk.

3883
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:45,420
It doesn't even let me crouch or anything.

3884
02:25:46,740 --> 02:25:47,700
Lily Fields.

3885
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:50,820
Sing from the heart.

3886
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:52,340
Sing from the heart, Gumi.

3887
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:53,920
That's so nice.

3888
02:25:53,980 --> 02:25:55,120
I don't have to play the video game.

3889
02:25:56,980 --> 02:25:58,360
I get to do a watch-along.

3890
02:25:58,440 --> 02:25:59,620
It's Reacts content time!

3891
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:01,960
Doki reacts to Gumi.

3892
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:01,960
Oh my god.

3893
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:02,580
Gumi's gameplay.

3894
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:05,000
Oh my god, what is Gumi gonna do now?

3895
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:07,440
What the fuck is that?

3896
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:08,840
What the fuck is that?

3897
02:26:08,860 --> 02:26:09,280
Is that me?

3898
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:10,000
Oh shit!

3899
02:26:10,440 --> 02:26:10,840
Oh, it's you!

3900
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:10,840
It's your turn!

3901
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:13,500
Gumi reacts to... What do I have to say?

3902
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:14,880
This isn't my dream and hopes.

3903
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:18,580
Am I just walking too?

3904
02:26:21,740 --> 02:26:24,980
Look at all these people here for you.

3905
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:27,680
There has to be at least 5,000 people there.

3906
02:26:28,380 --> 02:26:29,800
That does not look 5,000.

3907
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:33,800
That looks like maybe 130.

3908
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:38,240
That looks at least like 10,000 people in the audience.

3909
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:39,820
No pressure.

3910
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:42,740
What?

3911
02:26:42,740 --> 02:26:43,060
Oh shit!

3912
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:44,160
Doki reacts.

3913
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:46,960
Alright, so Gumi's gonna walk straight in the line.

3914
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:47,980
I wonder what's gonna happen.

3915
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:48,380
Chat?

3916
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:49,980
I'm actually turning.

3917
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:51,680
She's gonna start turning?

3918
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:53,300
Oh, I think I got chat.

3919
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:55,780
I think she's heading to the stage that we just saw earlier.

3920
02:26:56,620 --> 02:26:57,100
Hahaha!

3921
02:26:57,900 --> 02:26:58,140
Hahaha!

3922
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:02,040
Vehicle maintenance.

3923
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:04,640
Oh, those are my books!

3924
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:05,660
That's my shit!

3925
02:27:10,140 --> 02:27:11,180
Classic children's stories.

3926
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:12,220
Oh, you're gonna start playing!

3927
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:13,940
Wait, are you even gonna sing?

3928
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:15,760
Or is it maestro time?

3929
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:18,640
Oh my god, it's the concert getting ready.

3930
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:26,610
Oh my god!

3931
02:27:26,970 --> 02:27:27,930
They're all here for you!

3932
02:27:27,930 --> 02:27:30,870
They don't have eyes so they can't see if it's a bad performance.

3933
02:27:30,990 --> 02:27:31,690
Dude, they were kidnapped.

3934
02:27:32,210 --> 02:27:34,170
They were literally kidnapped to be here.

3935
02:27:35,430 --> 02:27:36,510
I believe in you.

3936
02:27:36,650 --> 02:27:37,290
Come on!

3937
02:27:37,290 --> 02:27:38,030
They have to clap.

3938
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:39,810
If they don't clap, they stay here forever.

3939
02:27:40,730 --> 02:27:42,970
They can't go home to their families.

3940
02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:47,210
Oh yeah, the daughter.

3941
02:27:47,430 --> 02:27:48,450
I almost forgot about her.

3942
02:27:48,590 --> 02:27:49,010
She's like...

3943
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:51,150
What's going on?

3944
02:27:52,050 --> 02:27:54,710
It's been like... eight hours now.

3945
02:27:56,090 --> 02:27:58,330
Dinner was supposed to be ready an hour ago.

3946
02:27:59,730 --> 02:28:00,210
Mom?

3947
02:28:00,690 --> 02:28:01,170
Dad?

3948
02:28:01,630 --> 02:28:02,390
Are you guys just...

3949
02:28:02,390 --> 02:28:03,550
There's this... another attic!

3950
02:28:10,470 --> 02:28:10,970
Mom?

3951
02:28:10,970 --> 02:28:11,170
Dad?

3952
02:28:11,450 --> 02:28:14,110
The music just started playing in the attic above us.

3953
02:28:15,110 --> 02:28:17,730
Are there people that like... you know...

3954
02:28:19,370 --> 02:28:20,550
Do we have ghosts?

3955
02:28:20,890 --> 02:28:21,710
Do we have ghosts?

3956
02:28:23,770 --> 02:28:26,470
I thought... I thought it was just us three.

3957
02:28:27,250 --> 02:28:28,570
Mom, wake up!

3958
02:28:28,570 --> 02:28:29,230
Mom, look!

3959
02:28:30,130 --> 02:28:31,650
Look what I found, Mom!

3960
02:28:32,230 --> 02:28:33,750
The sun is setting now!

3961
02:28:36,990 --> 02:28:37,490
Mom?

3962
02:28:39,910 --> 02:28:39,930
Mom?

3963
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:42,990
Mommy...

3964
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:46,410
I found your favorite song.

3965
02:28:47,930 --> 02:28:49,410
Shut up!

3966
02:28:49,410 --> 02:28:49,810
I'm sleeping!

3967
02:28:57,550 --> 02:28:59,030
Oh... shit...

3968
02:29:00,190 --> 02:29:01,970
Oh my god!

3969
02:29:02,110 --> 02:29:04,390
This is so sad for the child!

3970
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:07,970
She has so many issues right now!

3971
02:29:09,410 --> 02:29:12,630
Like both their parents are unresponsive.

3972
02:29:12,750 --> 02:29:16,730
And like, I'm giving you my heart mom, I love you.

3973
02:29:17,010 --> 02:29:19,370
And then mom's just like, don't know wald.

3974
02:29:34,470 --> 02:29:35,710
Sing anaconda!

3975
02:29:37,490 --> 02:29:43,910
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't, my anaconda don't want none.

3976
02:29:44,790 --> 02:29:49,010
Okay, to be fair, this audience is not there for classic music.

3977
02:29:51,410 --> 02:29:53,610
Like this is a rave audience.

3978
02:29:53,950 --> 02:29:56,790
We have the wrong fucking fans here.

3979
02:30:03,550 --> 02:30:05,870
Bro they're so fucking boring.

3980
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:16,370
Where are the words?

3981
02:30:16,510 --> 02:30:17,810
Where are the beats?

3982
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:32,620
We are flying.

3983
02:30:41,540 --> 02:30:42,680
Are we gonna kiss?

3984
02:30:42,820 --> 02:30:43,500
Oh my god.

3985
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:45,460
With the power of music?

3986
02:30:45,940 --> 02:30:47,800
Are our kids running away from home right now?

3987
02:30:53,650 --> 02:30:54,690
Marriage saved.

3988
02:30:55,530 --> 02:30:56,990
That was beautiful, Mae.

3989
02:30:57,610 --> 02:30:58,430
Thank you.

3990
02:31:01,830 --> 02:31:02,510
I do.

3991
02:31:04,330 --> 02:31:04,850
What?

3992
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:05,370
Hold.

3993
02:31:06,030 --> 02:31:08,030
We're actually gonna, no, fly away.

3994
02:31:08,270 --> 02:31:08,850
Fly away.

3995
02:31:13,670 --> 02:31:14,190
No!

3996
02:31:14,190 --> 02:31:14,710
Don't!

3997
02:31:14,710 --> 02:31:22,730
Let go!

3998
02:31:23,150 --> 02:31:24,790
Oh, I can back away from you.

3999
02:31:24,830 --> 02:31:25,230
I can...

4000
02:31:29,390 --> 02:31:30,350
Oh my god.

4001
02:31:30,350 --> 02:31:32,590
We stared deeply into each other's eyes.

4002
02:31:33,210 --> 02:31:33,690
Clink.

4003
02:31:33,690 --> 02:31:34,070
Clink.

4004
02:31:34,370 --> 02:31:34,850
Clink.

4005
02:31:34,850 --> 02:31:35,090
Clink.

4006
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:38,610
Oh, but what if I don't?

4007
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:41,630
That's right.

4008
02:31:41,890 --> 02:31:42,530
I'm getting the ick.

4009
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:43,770
I'm getting the ick right now.

4010
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:45,210
Unless I haven't finished the scene.

4011
02:31:45,290 --> 02:31:46,170
I'm getting the ick.

4012
02:31:47,790 --> 02:31:48,270
Okay.

4013
02:31:48,750 --> 02:31:49,770
Slow and steady.

4014
02:31:51,510 --> 02:31:53,270
And I go straight in.

4015
02:31:53,390 --> 02:31:54,510
But what if I stop?

4016
02:31:54,790 --> 02:31:55,790
Oh, it won't let me.

4017
02:31:56,930 --> 02:31:58,950
Please, I'm getting the ick!

4018
02:31:59,630 --> 02:32:16,280
And then I stop.

4019
02:32:19,220 --> 02:32:21,820
Just close your fucking eyes and go ahead!

4020
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:23,840
Just the two of us...

4021
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:29,300
Just the two of us... I'm gonna stare deep into your eyes!

4022
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:33,360
My controller is vibing!

4023
02:32:33,620 --> 02:32:34,720
My crazy table!

4024
02:32:35,260 --> 02:32:37,040
Guys, here, this is...

4025
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:38,680
This is the sound of the controller.

4026
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:45,160
Oh my god!

4027
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:46,200
It's right there!

4028
02:32:46,900 --> 02:32:48,280
See, first it lives!

4029
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:50,180
He's like, get closer!

4030
02:32:50,440 --> 02:32:51,300
Get closer!

4031
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:52,800
Whoa...

4032
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:57,000
Almost there!

4033
02:32:59,160 --> 02:32:59,760
Almost...

4034
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,480
Almost...

4035
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:03,720
Bro!

4036
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:04,860
Bro!

4037
02:33:13,940 --> 02:33:15,440
There you go.

4038
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:17,360
Wait, is that even a kiss yet?

4039
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:19,120
Cause I didn't close my eyes!

4040
02:33:19,820 --> 02:33:20,420
Please!

4041
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:31,460
I like saw two different X's in the time frame!

4042
02:33:32,860 --> 02:33:33,360
Hahaha!

4043
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:38,020
Wait!

4044
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:41,100
It's the slow burn!

4045
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:42,660
Don't you like slow burn?

4046
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:44,220
Oh god...

4047
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:47,400
That was like 130 chapters in.

4048
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:48,180
Hahaha!

4049
02:33:48,880 --> 02:33:49,740
This is it!

4050
02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:55,420
Oh no...

4051
02:33:55,420 --> 02:33:58,560
No, this is Stockholm Syndrome taking effect right now.

4052
02:34:00,500 --> 02:34:01,620
Singing a song!

4053
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:04,740
This is just miraculously fucking fixing marriage!

4054
02:34:04,960 --> 02:34:06,300
There are underlying issues!

4055
02:34:07,420 --> 02:34:07,800
Hahaha!

4056
02:34:09,080 --> 02:34:10,180
Look at that!

4057
02:34:10,520 --> 02:34:11,560
So beautiful!

4058
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:14,660
Ew, he's like, nodding over it.

4059
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:15,760
Hahaha!

4060
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:17,100
He's like, ugh!

4061
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:17,800
Stop!

4062
02:34:20,660 --> 02:34:24,800
Oh my god, this guy watched this five minute kiss that we had.

4063
02:34:30,310 --> 02:34:33,810
There's like underlying issues that we have in this marriage!

4064
02:34:34,330 --> 02:34:36,650
Fucking singing wouldn't fix this!

4065
02:34:37,290 --> 02:34:38,730
Oh my god, we're normal!

4066
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:40,710
We're normal people now!

4067
02:34:42,030 --> 02:34:43,290
World's greatest dad!

4068
02:34:43,950 --> 02:34:44,690
As me!

4069
02:34:45,610 --> 02:34:47,170
We're sure world's greatest mom!

4070
02:34:47,350 --> 02:34:48,350
Oh my god, wait, look at our computer!

4071
02:34:49,390 --> 02:34:49,930
What?

4072
02:34:50,910 --> 02:34:52,090
What's that on the computer?

4073
02:34:52,170 --> 02:34:53,470
We are back in the 90's!

4074
02:34:53,630 --> 02:34:55,190
Oh, this is the 90's?

4075
02:34:56,110 --> 02:34:57,990
We're like back in the early 2000's!

4076
02:34:58,090 --> 02:34:59,010
What the fuck?

4077
02:34:59,050 --> 02:35:00,150
Look how clear it is outside!

4078
02:35:00,510 --> 02:35:01,690
Where do we live?

4079
02:35:02,570 --> 02:35:04,110
I mean, we're on the farm!

4080
02:35:05,070 --> 02:35:05,630
Rose!

4081
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:08,710
Cody!

4082
02:35:09,290 --> 02:35:09,850
May!

4083
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:11,470
It works!

4084
02:35:11,510 --> 02:35:13,850
Oh, I was like sleeping in a different... Am I taller than you?

4085
02:35:14,030 --> 02:35:14,690
Yes you are.

4086
02:35:14,930 --> 02:35:15,850
Short king.

4087
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:16,470
I don't know.

4088
02:35:17,030 --> 02:35:17,130
Hahaha!

4089
02:35:23,490 --> 02:35:24,050
Rose?

4090
02:35:31,460 --> 02:35:32,420
Peace, Papu.

4091
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:34,060
Just throw it in the trash.

4092
02:35:34,420 --> 02:35:34,900
Hahaha!

4093
02:35:36,820 --> 02:35:39,560
Rose ran away while we're dealing with our problems.

4094
02:35:43,190 --> 02:35:44,950
Dear mom and dad...

4095
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:44,950
Hey!

4096
02:35:45,190 --> 02:35:45,690
What?

4097
02:35:46,010 --> 02:35:46,770
The letter.

4098
02:35:47,690 --> 02:35:49,430
We didn't even read the letter?

4099
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:51,190
Dear mom and dad...

4100
02:35:51,870 --> 02:35:53,810
I'm sorry that I did this to you.

4101
02:35:54,150 --> 02:35:54,810
That's right.

4102
02:35:55,150 --> 02:35:56,910
I know how to make everything good again.

4103
02:35:57,090 --> 02:35:58,030
Oh my god!

4104
02:35:58,550 --> 02:35:59,790
All I have to do is stop fighting.

4105
02:36:01,230 --> 02:36:03,070
I know I'm not a perfect daughter.

4106
02:36:03,270 --> 02:36:03,550
No!

4107
02:36:05,810 --> 02:36:08,370
I'm sorry I don't like to brush my teeth.

4108
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:11,050
Bro, what the fuck is wrong with you?

4109
02:36:11,410 --> 02:36:11,430
I'm sorry I didn't have a good time.

4110
02:36:12,210 --> 02:36:15,030
I'm sorry I don't put my toys where they should be.

4111
02:36:16,250 --> 02:36:18,350
I know it's my fault you wanted to fight.

4112
02:36:18,350 --> 02:36:18,470
I know it's my fault you wanted to fight.

4113
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:20,650
She's blaming herself.

4114
02:36:21,470 --> 02:36:22,590
That's her fault.

4115
02:36:25,790 --> 02:36:27,110
And she's right.

4116
02:36:27,210 --> 02:36:29,130
No, I'm just joking about that.

4117
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:30,750
You should be friends.

4118
02:36:30,830 --> 02:36:32,270
You should be friends.

4119
02:36:32,410 --> 02:36:32,970
I love you, mom.

4120
02:36:33,170 --> 02:36:35,530
Mom and dad are really good friends.

4121
02:36:36,150 --> 02:36:37,030
P.S.

4122
02:36:38,370 --> 02:36:39,850
I have pocket money to buy a bus ticket.

4123
02:36:40,610 --> 02:36:41,310
Don't worry.

4124
02:36:41,570 --> 02:36:43,790
I packed a sandwich and a lollipop.

4125
02:36:43,930 --> 02:36:44,670
What the fuck?

4126
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:45,970
She's gonna die out there.

4127
02:36:46,530 --> 02:36:46,970
Brode!

4128
02:36:47,830 --> 02:36:50,270
What are you doing after the bus, child?

4129
02:36:52,730 --> 02:36:53,630
Where's our car?

4130
02:36:53,890 --> 02:36:54,790
Do we not have a car?

4131
02:36:55,450 --> 02:36:57,190
What was all that oil for?

4132
02:36:58,670 --> 02:36:59,890
I'm not gonna talk about it.

4133
02:37:00,770 --> 02:37:01,690
What happened to her?

4134
02:37:01,790 --> 02:37:03,510
She already took the bus and we're just running.

4135
02:37:04,270 --> 02:37:05,430
You can go home.

4136
02:37:05,710 --> 02:37:06,030
No.

4137
02:37:08,370 --> 02:37:12,370
Honey, it's not your fault that we've been fighting.

4138
02:37:16,210 --> 02:37:17,330
It isn't.

4139
02:37:17,670 --> 02:37:18,850
No, Rose.

4140
02:37:18,850 --> 02:37:24,710
When we ignored you after you tried to call for us for five plus hours, it's not your fault.

4141
02:37:24,870 --> 02:37:25,890
We weren't ignoring you.

4142
02:37:25,890 --> 02:37:29,710
We might have ghosts in our house, but like you said, you can become friends again.

4143
02:37:29,710 --> 02:37:30,010
Here now.

4144
02:37:30,450 --> 02:37:31,790
Honey, listen.

4145
02:37:31,930 --> 02:37:34,810
Whatever happens, your mom and me...

4146
02:37:34,810 --> 02:37:36,270
Rose, listen.

4147
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:40,370
If we're not friends, that means you get two birthdays.

4148
02:37:41,150 --> 02:37:42,270
And two Christmases.

4149
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:45,890
That's fun.

4150
02:37:47,410 --> 02:37:47,870
That's fun.

4151
02:37:49,610 --> 02:37:50,310
Come here.

4152
02:37:50,430 --> 02:37:51,870
Oh shit.

4153
02:37:51,950 --> 02:37:53,150
Hey, throw that shit away.

4154
02:37:53,570 --> 02:37:54,390
Burn the book.

4155
02:37:56,330 --> 02:37:58,070
Why the fuck did she bring that shit with her?

4156
02:37:58,150 --> 02:37:58,710
What's wrong with you?

4157
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:09,020
Where did you find this?

4158
02:38:09,300 --> 02:38:10,560
I found it at school.

4159
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:12,200
In a trash can.

4160
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:12,540
What?

4161
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:12,900
What?

4162
02:38:13,960 --> 02:38:15,420
In a trash can?

4163
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:16,340
What?

4164
02:38:17,420 --> 02:38:19,440
Find real treasures in the trash.

4165
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:21,680
There's a reason why it's in the trash.

4166
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:22,700
It's fucking cursed.

4167
02:38:23,220 --> 02:38:24,300
It's a cursed book.

4168
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:26,420
How come there's a kid digging through the trash can in the first place?

4169
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:29,120
I bet it was you.

4170
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:30,240
I bet you taught her that.

4171
02:38:30,740 --> 02:38:31,640
What the fuck?

4172
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:37,760
If your mom had to fight an aggressive squirrel double her size, who do you think would win?

4173
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:39,080
Mom, of course.

4174
02:38:39,380 --> 02:38:40,920
Did we literally fix our marriage?

4175
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:41,800
You're right.

4176
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:43,780
I'm realistic.

4177
02:38:44,440 --> 02:38:45,400
That's unrealistic.

4178
02:38:46,180 --> 02:38:48,360
I think you are completely irrational.

4179
02:38:49,080 --> 02:38:52,240
But I have to say, you make more sense now.

4180
02:38:55,540 --> 02:38:56,600
We did it!

4181
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:59,580
Oh my god, there's the sucker.

4182
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:03,660
Oh my god, and the hammer and the weird toolbox.

4183
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:04,220
Yeah.

4184
02:39:07,400 --> 02:39:11,280
Oh, there's whoever's fucking binoculars that is.

4185
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:16,460
Whoever we're looking at, that's directed at our house.

4186
02:39:17,620 --> 02:39:19,060
We did it!

4187
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:20,780
We beat the game!

4188
02:39:21,340 --> 02:39:23,160
Look, she's fixed now!

4189
02:39:23,980 --> 02:39:24,720
See?

4190
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:26,680
We're not fucked up parents.

4191
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:27,560
We fixed her.

4192
02:39:31,020 --> 02:39:32,440
Oh, and the clock.

4193
02:39:37,820 --> 02:39:39,580
Oh my god.

4194
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:41,260
We fucking did it.

4195
02:39:41,300 --> 02:39:42,140
Go away.

4196
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:43,300
Oh, and the clock.

4197
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:44,640
We did it!

4198
02:39:44,780 --> 02:39:46,360
Oh my god, there's the fat bee.

4199
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:48,540
Yeah, remember?

4200
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:49,780
That's the one that ditched us.

4201
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:50,480
Yeah.

4202
02:39:51,140 --> 02:39:53,320
That somehow never got shot.

4203
02:39:55,620 --> 02:39:57,760
Why did she put it so high up?

4204
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:00,200
That's her god now.

4205
02:40:01,460 --> 02:40:03,440
Thank you for fixing the marriage.

4206
02:40:04,020 --> 02:40:05,520
They're friends again.

4207
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,640
Yeah, very good friends.

4208
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:12,600
The book of love.

4209
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:13,960
The book of love.

4210
02:40:14,540 --> 02:40:15,060
Yeah!

4211
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:22,000
I still can't believe, like, we got, like, rave slash...

4212
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,660
What the fuck did you pause for?

4213
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:24,680
What the fuck did you pause for?

4214
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:26,160
Dude, this is so fucking loud.

4215
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:33,820
I just can't believe we got, like, the rave club people to be your audience for fucking classical music.

4216
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:37,180
That is, like, the most unrealistic part of this game.

4217
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:37,620
Dude, thank you.

4218
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:46,880
I remember we came from a club that was like, go way back in the club, got our pickups, dropped the beat, and now I'm going, ahhhh.

4219
02:40:53,290 --> 02:40:55,730
I'm just like, I don't think they were here for this.

4220
02:40:56,070 --> 02:40:57,870
They waited in line, dude.

4221
02:40:57,990 --> 02:41:01,110
Those people waited in line to get into that club.

4222
02:41:01,510 --> 02:41:05,990
And then they fucking got dragged to your fucking classical music concert.

4223
02:41:06,810 --> 02:41:07,330
Like...

4224
02:41:09,310 --> 02:41:11,990
Dude, that person's name is Uno Byte.

4225
02:41:12,870 --> 02:41:13,890
Uno Byte?

4226
02:41:15,090 --> 02:41:16,510
What did I just read?

4227
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:17,070
What?

4228
02:41:18,490 --> 02:41:21,110
Uno Byte... Is there an after credits scene, chat?

4229
02:41:23,730 --> 02:41:25,710
Yeah, they got scammed in the club.

4230
02:41:26,330 --> 02:41:29,610
Is there an after- wait, this game was made in Europe?

4231
02:41:31,110 --> 02:41:32,070
Which country?

4232
02:41:32,850 --> 02:41:33,910
Who made this?

4233
02:41:35,870 --> 02:41:36,430
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh.

4234
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:38,370
Frozen 2.

4235
02:41:44,490 --> 02:41:45,610
Unreal Engine.

4236
02:41:46,770 --> 02:41:48,630
I think it was really creative though.

4237
02:41:48,690 --> 02:41:51,470
This game was very creative with the mechanics and everything.

4238
02:41:52,010 --> 02:41:56,830
I love the- I think the level design was really pretty in general.

4239
02:41:58,550 --> 02:42:01,610
Like I definitely- I came into this game really blind.

4240
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:05,870
The only thing I remember was the math and the beginning.

4241
02:42:06,530 --> 02:42:07,390
Like, what they look like.

4242
02:42:10,150 --> 02:42:10,590
Sweden?

4243
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:12,790
Oh, it was made by the Swedes!

4244
02:42:12,810 --> 02:42:13,010
Oh!

4245
02:42:13,650 --> 02:42:14,070
Oh!

4246
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:20,250
I'm surprised, like, it was...

4247
02:42:21,230 --> 02:42:25,150
You know how, like, Sweden is, like, super fucking...

4248
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:28,130
What is it?

4249
02:42:28,150 --> 02:42:29,230
Very cloudy and stuff?

4250
02:42:32,190 --> 02:42:34,930
I'm surprised that it was, like, so sunny out there.

4251
02:42:38,550 --> 02:42:40,890
I've never, like, even looked over yonder.

4252
02:42:43,890 --> 02:42:45,870
Is there an after credits scene?

4253
02:42:46,350 --> 02:42:46,970
I don't remember.

4254
02:42:47,690 --> 02:42:49,190
I didn't check chat.

4255
02:42:49,430 --> 02:42:49,930
I don't know.

4256
02:42:50,290 --> 02:42:51,090
I was surprised.

4257
02:42:51,190 --> 02:42:52,910
I was like, I can see the sun in this game.

4258
02:42:53,970 --> 02:42:54,370
What?

4259
02:42:56,470 --> 02:42:56,870
Yeah?

4260
02:42:57,070 --> 02:42:57,570
There is?

4261
02:42:57,830 --> 02:42:58,390
No clue?

4262
02:42:59,150 --> 02:42:59,870
Oh, there is!

4263
02:43:00,070 --> 02:43:00,950
How do we skip that?

4264
02:43:01,190 --> 02:43:01,870
Do we skip it?

4265
02:43:03,610 --> 02:43:04,870
No, we can't.

4266
02:43:05,050 --> 02:43:05,670
Wait, we can!

4267
02:43:06,870 --> 02:43:07,530
Alright, I'm ready.

4268
02:43:07,990 --> 02:43:08,230
Do we skip?

4269
02:43:08,230 --> 02:43:08,590
Or nah?

4270
02:43:09,370 --> 02:43:10,050
I'll have to...

4271
02:43:10,050 --> 02:43:11,030
Alright, I'm gonna do it.

4272
02:43:11,150 --> 02:43:12,370
Wait, I need you to do it.

4273
02:43:12,430 --> 02:43:13,030
It's a group effort.

4274
02:43:19,740 --> 02:43:21,060
No, there isn't.

4275
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:23,580
We're not supposed to skip!

4276
02:43:27,950 --> 02:43:28,950
Oh my god.

4277
02:43:29,210 --> 02:43:30,350
Oh my god.

4278
02:43:37,790 --> 02:43:38,750
Invite me again!

4279
02:43:38,950 --> 02:43:39,910
Invite me again!

4280
02:43:40,450 --> 02:43:42,810
Invite me again and just click the credits button!

4281
02:43:44,370 --> 02:43:44,810
There!

4282
02:43:47,010 --> 02:43:48,310
First credits!

4283
02:43:48,590 --> 02:43:49,270
Wait!

4284
02:43:49,490 --> 02:43:50,890
We have to watch!

4285
02:43:50,970 --> 02:43:53,010
Can we just look at the credits here?

4286
02:43:53,470 --> 02:43:54,490
Does it work?

4287
02:43:54,910 --> 02:43:56,590
No, it doesn't!

4288
02:43:58,210 --> 02:43:58,550
Wait!

4289
02:43:59,310 --> 02:43:59,650
What?

4290
02:44:00,130 --> 02:44:03,330
We have to fucking actually...

4291
02:44:03,330 --> 02:44:04,870
Oh my god!

4292
02:44:05,210 --> 02:44:07,130
How was I supposed to know?

4293
02:44:09,940 --> 02:44:11,100
Oh my god.

4294
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:11,980
I'm gonna YouTube it.

4295
02:44:12,100 --> 02:44:13,060
I'm YouTubing.

4296
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:13,980
Okay.

4297
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:15,220
Alright.

4298
02:44:15,360 --> 02:44:16,300
It takes...

4299
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:19,940
It takes two... You're gonna listen to it.

4300
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:21,900
And...

4301
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:26,340
Okay.

4302
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:30,600
Alternate... After credits...

4303
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:32,660
Credits C.

4304
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:34,080
What is it?

4305
02:44:34,460 --> 02:44:35,500
The basement?

4306
02:44:35,820 --> 02:44:35,980
There isn't.

4307
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:37,500
Yes, there is.

4308
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:38,940
No, there isn't.

4309
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:42,000
There's like a basement.

4310
02:44:42,220 --> 02:44:42,980
Is this the...

4311
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:45,600
Wait, there isn't?

4312
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:46,820
Were we lied to?

4313
02:44:49,660 --> 02:44:50,860
There isn't!

4314
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:51,680
We got...

4315
02:44:53,320 --> 02:44:55,160
I can't believe it.

4316
02:44:55,280 --> 02:44:58,120
We actually... We actually got gas lit.

4317
02:44:58,240 --> 02:44:59,580
I can't believe it.

4318
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:02,500
You just got one guide.

4319
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:03,600
We got one guide.

4320
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:04,840
We got multiple guides.

4321
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,800
People were freaking out and was like, why did you skip?

4322
02:45:08,380 --> 02:45:10,660
Why did you skip?

4323
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:11,800
Alright.

4324
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:12,700
It's time to go fishing.

4325
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:13,400
Alright.

4326
02:45:14,100 --> 02:45:14,700
GG's.

4327
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:15,140
Gumi.

4328
02:45:15,140 --> 02:45:17,400
Are you gonna go play Minecraft or TFT?

4329
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:20,180
After TFT, I'm about to get eliminated.

4330
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:21,040
Oh, shit.

4331
02:45:21,140 --> 02:45:21,680
You're in last place?

4332
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:26,360
They eliminate like four to five people every day.

4333
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:27,360
Oh, shit.

4334
02:45:27,460 --> 02:45:28,520
Are you last place?

4335
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:31,520
Girl, what do you mean am I last place?

4336
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:32,600
You said you might get eliminated.

4337
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:35,720
Yeah, because everyone's climbing right now.

4338
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:40,060
So, if I don't climb actively, I'll keep dropping because I'm in the same spot.

4339
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:40,780
Oh.

4340
02:45:41,580 --> 02:45:42,020
Alright.

4341
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:43,040
Good luck, Gumi.

4342
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:44,100
You wanna play?

4343
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:45,380
No, that's okay.

4344
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:45,900
Good luck.

4345
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:46,140
Bye.

4346
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:54,780
Alright.

4347
02:45:54,780 --> 02:45:55,640
Good luck.

4348
02:45:55,920 --> 02:45:56,120
Wait.

4349
02:45:56,720 --> 02:45:57,520
What was the other one?

4350
02:45:57,800 --> 02:45:59,960
Chat, Donkey said she would play the other game with me.

4351
02:45:59,960 --> 02:45:59,980
No, no.

4352
02:46:00,020 --> 02:46:01,320
There's no other one.

4353
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:03,360
The other game that they made?

4354
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:05,100
No, it's just that it takes two.

4355
02:46:05,320 --> 02:46:07,200
This was like... it was that.

4356
02:46:07,340 --> 02:46:12,380
You can technically... but they've mistaken from two brothers with husband and wife.

4357
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:13,580
There's no other game.

4358
02:46:13,580 --> 02:46:15,580
Guys, guys, there's no other game.

4359
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:16,920
Chat.

4360
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:20,460
I think you guys are like... you got like the...

4361
02:46:20,460 --> 02:46:21,680
Oh, a way out.

4362
02:46:21,900 --> 02:46:22,800
No, no, no.

4363
02:46:22,900 --> 02:46:23,660
It takes two.

4364
02:46:24,160 --> 02:46:25,760
Wait, Donkey is 80% off right now.

4365
02:46:26,460 --> 02:46:27,700
No, no, no, no, no.

4366
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:30,280
That's like made by a fake studio.

4367
02:46:30,900 --> 02:46:32,320
You know, it's like Helldivers.

4368
02:46:32,340 --> 02:46:39,040
When Helldivers got released, another studio released Helldivers 2 to like pretend to be Helldivers 2.

4369
02:46:39,460 --> 02:46:42,080
So, people would fall for like the 80% off thing.

4370
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:43,200
That's what they did.

4371
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:44,020
For that.

4372
02:46:44,420 --> 02:46:45,920
That's... it's not the same studio.

4373
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:49,480
You say something?

4374
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:51,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4375
02:46:54,920 --> 02:46:59,540
Hey, have you... have you let your chat play Lurkbait yet?

4376
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:00,800
Lurkbait?

4377
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:01,100
What?

4378
02:47:01,960 --> 02:47:02,900
Yeah, Lurkbait.

4379
02:47:03,160 --> 02:47:03,740
What is that?

4380
02:47:05,020 --> 02:47:06,860
It's where you can let your viewers fish.

4381
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:08,460
Wait, what?

4382
02:47:09,380 --> 02:47:10,860
Yeah, they can fish on stream.

4383
02:47:10,860 --> 02:47:13,080
Oh, I saw this on Twitter before.

4384
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:14,500
Isn't this a Twitch interactive?

4385
02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:15,820
Yeah, it's on Twitch only.

4386
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:17,600
Oh my God, I got Twitch partnered.

4387
02:47:18,680 --> 02:47:19,800
Oh, you did?

4388
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:21,660
Yeah, I got Twitch partnered today.

4389
02:47:21,800 --> 02:47:25,840
They sent me like an email today being like, congratulations, you got Twitch partnered.

4390
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:34,340
And like, like I sent it in an app, but like I didn't think I would get in because like I literally only streamed twice since I got back.

4391
02:47:34,620 --> 02:47:38,360
And then I got the email being like, congratulations, you're a Twitch partner.

4392
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:45,820
And I literally wrote on the application because, you know, I don't know if you remember, but when you write like why you want to be a Twitch partner, you have to write like something.

4393
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:47,380
And all I wrote was, please.

4394
02:47:49,460 --> 02:47:50,540
Oh my God.

4395
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:52,040
I just wrote, please.

4396
02:47:52,360 --> 02:47:54,120
And I submitted it.

4397
02:47:54,260 --> 02:47:55,680
And you say, please.

4398
02:47:56,940 --> 02:47:59,140
I think I'm special case here.

4399
02:47:59,300 --> 02:48:03,540
I'm pretty sure due to my circumstances, they're like, you know what, we know who she is.

4400
02:48:08,360 --> 02:48:10,080
But yeah, I got it today.

4401
02:48:10,420 --> 02:48:11,420
I was so surprised.

4402
02:48:11,560 --> 02:48:15,620
I honestly didn't think they would give it to me because usually they're like, you have to be active on Twitch.

4403
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:21,040
But yeah.

4404
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:23,520
The pity part.

4405
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:24,340
That's me.

4406
02:48:26,700 --> 02:48:27,280
You go.

4407
02:48:27,460 --> 02:48:28,460
See you for a way out.

4408
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:29,860
In two weeks.

4409
02:48:30,180 --> 02:48:30,560
What?

4410
02:48:31,580 --> 02:48:33,240
See you for a way out in two weeks.

4411
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:33,420
What?

4412
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:35,800
Wait, wait, wait.

4413
02:48:36,220 --> 02:48:37,020
Wait, wait, wait.

4414
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:39,800
We're going to go from married to brother.

4415
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:44,460
I mean, it could have been brothers to married.

4416
02:48:45,380 --> 02:48:46,940
Yeah, we should have done it the other way around.

4417
02:48:46,980 --> 02:48:48,720
Yeah, we should have done it the other way around.

4418
02:48:48,860 --> 02:48:49,720
That would make more sense.

4419
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:52,760
I mean, we can make up a... not make up.

4420
02:48:52,760 --> 02:48:53,480
It could be a prequel.

4421
02:48:53,560 --> 02:48:54,380
It's our prequel.

4422
02:48:55,420 --> 02:48:57,060
Before we were married, we were brothers.

4423
02:48:57,060 --> 02:48:59,440
We could be married and then find out we're brothers.

4424
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:00,660
Oh, that's true.

4425
02:49:00,740 --> 02:49:01,820
But we're still together.

4426
02:49:02,920 --> 02:49:04,480
Yeah, we're not telling our kids.

4427
02:49:05,420 --> 02:49:07,440
As long as we don't tell our child.

4428
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:10,740
No, my friend actually asked me that story.

4429
02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:17,520
They were like, okay, let's say you had a boyfriend or a husband and then you had a kid together.

4430
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:21,080
And like, they're the most like perfect person in your entire life.

4431
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:23,140
Like, they're exactly what you want.

4432
02:49:23,420 --> 02:49:24,880
You're so happy with them.

4433
02:49:25,660 --> 02:49:26,140
Whatever.

4434
02:49:27,060 --> 02:49:29,360
But then you find out you're related to them.

4435
02:49:29,660 --> 02:49:30,140
Yeah.

4436
02:49:30,140 --> 02:49:35,120
Do you break up with them and divorce them and also tell your kids or like... what?

4437
02:49:35,320 --> 02:49:36,900
I mean, that's what denial is for.

4438
02:49:37,740 --> 02:49:38,240
Okay.

4439
02:49:38,500 --> 02:49:39,000
That's...

4440
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:40,880
Okay.

4441
02:49:44,020 --> 02:49:45,020
Like... like...

4442
02:49:49,100 --> 02:49:50,940
All right, what will you do?

4443
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:51,620
What will you do?

4444
02:49:53,280 --> 02:49:54,460
I have to think about it.

4445
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:55,700
Like...

4446
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:56,160
Like...

4447
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:57,180
It doesn't hurt anybody.

4448
02:49:57,180 --> 02:49:57,700
Is that the most perfect person?

4449
02:49:59,400 --> 02:49:59,900
Well...

4450
02:50:00,620 --> 02:50:03,440
I mean, maybe the kid is like, genetically wise.

4451
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:05,660
Because of inbreeding.

4452
02:50:05,660 --> 02:50:06,460
But...

4453
02:50:06,460 --> 02:50:12,760
As long as the child doesn't go forth and accidentally, you know, keep it in the family.

4454
02:50:15,080 --> 02:50:15,640
Yeah.

4455
02:50:16,660 --> 02:50:17,780
I think...

4456
02:50:20,580 --> 02:50:21,360
Yeah, no.

4457
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:23,120
I think at that point...

4458
02:50:25,420 --> 02:50:26,680
As long as only...

4459
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:26,800
If we're married...

4460
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:33,520
As long as only like two people know and it's the parents, I don't think like...

4461
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:36,240
Like, it's already done.

4462
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:36,940
Like...

4463
02:50:37,740 --> 02:50:38,300
Everything...

4464
02:50:38,300 --> 02:50:38,320
Yeah.

4465
02:50:38,320 --> 02:50:39,580
And if they're the most perfect person ever...

4466
02:50:39,580 --> 02:50:41,020
Everything is already done.

4467
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:42,420
So, it's like...

4468
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:43,600
There's really nothing...

4469
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:45,220
You can't take that away.

4470
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:47,120
Like, it's already there.

4471
02:50:47,400 --> 02:50:48,720
The child's there.

4472
02:50:48,920 --> 02:50:51,420
The product of the inbreeding is there.

4473
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:52,540
So...

4474
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:53,780
Like...

4475
02:50:53,780 --> 02:50:58,980
If you suddenly split up, you have to explain to the child why that happened.

4476
02:50:59,060 --> 02:51:04,080
I mean, I guess you won't explain it to them until you're at your desk bed and be like, the child...

4477
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:04,920
The child...

4478
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:05,780
The reason why...

4479
02:51:05,780 --> 02:51:06,220
But we should...

4480
02:51:06,220 --> 02:51:08,360
The reason why you have so many problems with your health...

4481
02:51:09,400 --> 02:51:10,200
Is because...

4482
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:12,500
Your father and I are actually...

4483
02:51:13,740 --> 02:51:14,140
Related...

4484
02:51:17,540 --> 02:51:17,940
Okay...

4485
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:19,560
But the next thing, cause obviously...

4486
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:19,840
...and then you die...

4487
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:23,140
And then you die so you don't have to live with the guilt cause you're already dead.

4488
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:27,960
As you tell them before, you don't have to live with the trauma after that.

4489
02:51:28,140 --> 02:51:28,940
But you're free.

4490
02:51:29,020 --> 02:51:29,560
You're dead already.

4491
02:51:29,720 --> 02:51:30,360
You don't have to worry.

4492
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:31,540
Okay.

4493
02:51:31,580 --> 02:51:31,820
Wait.

4494
02:51:31,960 --> 02:51:32,380
Hold on.

4495
02:51:32,380 --> 02:51:36,900
I don't quite know the rules of like inbreeding and everything.

4496
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:38,460
So it looks like we're...

4497
02:51:38,920 --> 02:51:40,220
No, no, we're not siblings.

4498
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:42,520
What if we're like second cousins?

4499
02:51:43,020 --> 02:51:44,040
Does it make sense?

4500
02:51:44,300 --> 02:51:47,500
Is the genetic tree still as bad as siblings?

4501
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:48,680
It's not as bad.

4502
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:51,180
It's not as bad but it's still bad.

4503
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:52,300
I know but...

4504
02:51:53,060 --> 02:51:55,220
No, I know it's bad but I...

4505
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:59,240
No, I'm trying to see how many health problems the kid would have.

4506
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:01,620
You're trying to find a degree of separation here.

4507
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:05,420
You're trying to see which is the right amount of separation.

4508
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:07,220
That would...

4509
02:52:07,220 --> 02:52:07,740
It's okay.

4510
02:52:07,900 --> 02:52:10,560
It's bad because you can't have like...

4511
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:14,320
If a population goes at a certain amount of people...

4512
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:18,460
If a population dies off to a certain amount...

4513
02:52:18,460 --> 02:52:21,400
There's no way for a population to continue.

4514
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:23,780
Because at some point inbreeding is gonna start.

4515
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:25,720
I don't remember what was the minimum.

4516
02:52:25,900 --> 02:52:30,980
But like every species needs a minimum requirement to prevent inbreeding.

4517
02:52:31,160 --> 02:52:31,600
So I'm gonna stop here.

4518
02:52:31,620 --> 02:52:32,500
So it doesn't matter.

4519
02:52:32,680 --> 02:52:35,900
It has to be incredibly split off.

4520
02:52:36,120 --> 02:52:38,320
So you don't fuck up the genetics.

4521
02:52:39,340 --> 02:52:40,620
It's 50, right?

4522
02:52:40,840 --> 02:52:40,880
Okay.

4523
02:52:40,880 --> 02:52:41,200
Is it 50?

4524
02:52:42,720 --> 02:52:45,500
Because I just want to know how fucked up this kid would be.

4525
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:46,620
I mean...

4526
02:52:46,620 --> 02:52:46,860
Because like...

4527
02:52:47,480 --> 02:52:47,740
Eventually...

4528
02:52:47,740 --> 02:52:48,020
Okay.

4529
02:52:48,820 --> 02:52:50,400
Okay, I don't even...

4530
02:52:50,400 --> 02:52:53,440
Why are we like thinking about the degrees here?

4531
02:52:53,780 --> 02:52:54,300
Why?

4532
02:52:55,080 --> 02:52:56,300
I'm thinking scientific.

4533
02:52:57,880 --> 02:52:58,700
For what?

4534
02:52:58,740 --> 02:52:59,240
What science?

4535
02:52:59,580 --> 02:53:01,560
Why would you need this as a science?

4536
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:02,540
A hypothesis!

4537
02:53:03,460 --> 02:53:03,980
Scurpy!

4538
02:53:07,020 --> 02:53:07,820
I think...

4539
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:09,960
I think you need to stop cooking.

4540
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:12,420
I was just curious, like...

4541
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:18,220
Is it the same like amount of fucked up genetics if it's like your third, like second cousin...

4542
02:53:19,760 --> 02:53:21,140
Compared to your like brother?

4543
02:53:22,420 --> 02:53:25,760
Oh yeah, because there's less similarities to the genetics.

4544
02:53:25,880 --> 02:53:26,860
Yeah, that's what I was saying!

4545
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:26,940
The more...

4546
02:53:26,940 --> 02:53:29,340
The closer the genes are...

4547
02:53:29,340 --> 02:53:30,660
The more fucked up...

4548
02:53:30,660 --> 02:53:32,100
The byproducts are.

4549
02:53:32,500 --> 02:53:35,620
Because you can't have the genetics to be similar.

4550
02:53:35,740 --> 02:53:36,620
Because then there's like...

4551
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:37,240
Like...

4552
02:53:37,240 --> 02:53:37,880
Issues.

4553
02:53:37,940 --> 02:53:38,500
Health issues.

4554
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:41,420
So as long as...

4555
02:53:41,420 --> 02:53:41,720
Like...

4556
02:53:41,720 --> 02:53:44,980
So if it's like second cousin removed or something...

4557
02:53:44,980 --> 02:53:47,440
It's less fucked up than your fucking brother.

4558
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:49,040
Or sister.

4559
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:52,240
Okay, because I was just wondering...

4560
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:53,400
If it's like...

4561
02:53:53,400 --> 02:53:56,440
Even if it was your second cousin, would it be as fucked up?

4562
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:57,540
Like the kid?

4563
02:53:57,640 --> 02:53:58,460
It's still fucked...

4564
02:53:58,460 --> 02:53:59,060
Okay, the kid...

4565
02:53:59,060 --> 02:54:00,860
No, no, like the kid is what I'm talking about.

4566
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:01,920
It's still fucked up.

4567
02:54:02,120 --> 02:54:02,940
No, morality...

4568
02:54:02,940 --> 02:54:05,100
Like morality-wise, it's fucked up no matter what.

4569
02:54:05,160 --> 02:54:05,380
Yeah, yeah.

4570
02:54:05,440 --> 02:54:06,520
But I'm wondering about the kid.

4571
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:08,780
Well, the kid will be less fucked up than...

4572
02:54:08,780 --> 02:54:10,040
Than the other kids.

4573
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:14,220
Okay, so they're not going to be the same amount of fucked up.

4574
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:14,760
No, no.

4575
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:16,360
Because it's all about genetic similarities.

4576
02:54:18,420 --> 02:54:19,680
It's about the genes.

4577
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:21,480
But...

4578
02:54:21,880 --> 02:54:22,720
Okay, but yes.

4579
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:28,060
Anyway, I think we've established how fucked up they will be genetically.

4580
02:54:28,060 --> 02:54:29,520
And morally.

4581
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:30,880
So I guess we can...

4582
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:31,340
How did we get on this topic again?

4583
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:32,060
So we can move...

4584
02:54:32,600 --> 02:54:35,060
You were the one that asked me about this.

4585
02:54:35,180 --> 02:54:35,280
Oh no!

4586
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:36,040
A way out!

4587
02:54:36,440 --> 02:54:37,300
It wasn't because of what I'm talking about.

4588
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:40,280
Because of the way out and the brothers thing.

4589
02:54:40,520 --> 02:54:42,980
Anyway guys, I hope you guys had a...

4590
02:54:42,980 --> 02:54:46,760
This after game chat got a little bit cursed.

4591
02:54:46,760 --> 02:54:47,600
Just a little bit.

4592
02:54:47,820 --> 02:54:50,780
But I hope you guys had a great time.

4593
02:54:50,920 --> 02:54:54,680
Gumi, you should go play your TFT so you don't get knocked out.

4594
02:54:55,660 --> 02:54:57,620
I felt like I just learned a lot.

4595
02:54:57,620 --> 02:54:58,040
I'm not sure if I learned a lot.

4596
02:54:58,040 --> 02:54:58,320
I...

4597
02:54:58,320 --> 02:55:04,440
Because I actually watched a Tiki Talk recently about that one family in America.

4598
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:07,580
What?

4599
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:11,240
The one family in America.

4600
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:13,280
The inbred family.

4601
02:55:13,460 --> 02:55:13,780
What?

4602
02:55:14,200 --> 02:55:14,740
The...

4603
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:15,660
The...

4604
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:17,060
Lanny...

4605
02:55:19,380 --> 02:55:20,300
Lanny...

4606
02:55:20,300 --> 02:55:21,260
Lanny...

4607
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:24,100
Lanny...

4608
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:26,840
Lanny...

4609
02:55:26,840 --> 02:55:27,660
Lanny...

4610
02:55:27,660 --> 02:55:28,020
Lanny...

4611
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:29,420
You don't know about the family?

4612
02:55:31,440 --> 02:55:32,000
What?

4613
02:55:33,520 --> 02:55:35,480
There was a documentary on them.

4614
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:39,760
The Woodtakers of Odd West Virginia.

4615
02:55:40,160 --> 02:55:40,440
Huh?

4616
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:44,300
Okay Gumi, stop cooking.

4617
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:45,400
Gumi, stop cooking.

4618
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:48,300
I think we gotta move on from the inbreeding.

4619
02:55:48,540 --> 02:55:50,520
I think we have to move on.

4620
02:55:50,540 --> 02:55:53,100
Anyways, that's why I was so interested in the science behind it.

4621
02:55:53,260 --> 02:55:56,320
Because I watched a documentary about it recently.

4622
02:55:56,780 --> 02:55:57,060
Okay.

4623
02:55:58,040 --> 02:56:00,720
Well, by documentary, I meant I watched a Tiki Talk about it.

4624
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:05,000
Everybody just watches the Tiki Talks of movies and videos now.

4625
02:56:05,480 --> 02:56:06,380
We do that.

4626
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:11,640
No, I watched a Tiki Talk about another person who made a video on them.

4627
02:56:11,680 --> 02:56:13,760
I was like, oh, so this person...

4628
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:16,780
Anyways.

4629
02:56:17,220 --> 02:56:19,100
Anyways, GG, Gumi.

4630
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:21,200
I can't believe we finished it.

4631
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:22,840
We finally did it.

4632
02:56:23,380 --> 02:56:26,580
It took us a while, but we fucking did it.

4633
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:27,620
GG, Gumi.

4634
02:56:27,720 --> 02:56:28,020
Don't...

4635
02:56:28,040 --> 02:56:29,520
Don't get knocked out in TFT.

4636
02:56:29,820 --> 02:56:30,660
We're gonna say...

4637
02:56:30,660 --> 02:56:31,660
Okay, see you two weeks from now.

4638
02:56:31,800 --> 02:56:32,380
Bye, Gumi.

4639
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:34,240
Bye, Gumi.

4640
02:56:34,660 --> 02:56:35,140
Bye.

4641
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:35,560
Bye.

4642
02:56:36,280 --> 02:56:36,480
Bye.

4643
02:56:37,360 --> 02:56:37,840
Bye.

4644
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:37,880
Bye.

4645
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:38,000
Love you.

4646
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:43,520
Alright, that was like the most cursed topic that we've had for a while.

4647
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:44,540
So...

4648
02:56:47,060 --> 02:56:49,060
But we did it, guys!

4649
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:52,920
We beat It Takes Two, finally.

4650
02:56:53,420 --> 02:56:54,300
The stream...

4651
02:56:54,300 --> 02:56:58,020
One of the most streamed games for co-op.

4652
02:56:58,020 --> 02:56:58,340
Ever.

4653
02:56:58,700 --> 02:57:00,500
And we fucking finally did it.

4654
02:57:00,600 --> 02:57:04,360
I hope you guys had a great time watching us.

4655
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:06,380
I'm gonna call it here.

4656
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:10,020
Had to go to therapy in like three hours.

4657
02:57:10,780 --> 02:57:12,740
We just finished relation...

4658
02:57:12,740 --> 02:57:15,500
We just finished marriage counseling.

4659
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:19,100
And now I have to go to actual therapy.

4660
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:20,440
Later.

4661
02:57:21,100 --> 02:57:23,680
So, I'm gonna go head out now.

4662
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:26,640
I hope you guys had a great time, everybody.

4663
02:57:26,640 --> 02:57:29,040
As always, everyone, stay hydrated.

4664
02:57:29,460 --> 02:57:30,100
Posture check.

4665
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:32,240
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4666
02:57:32,400 --> 02:57:35,100
And if you stay up for us, head to bed.

4667
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:36,580
Because you deserve it.

4668
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:38,040
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4669
02:57:38,620 --> 02:57:39,460
Bye, guys.

4670
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:40,460
Bye.
