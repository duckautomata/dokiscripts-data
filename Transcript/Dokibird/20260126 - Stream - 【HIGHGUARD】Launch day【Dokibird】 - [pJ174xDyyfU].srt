1
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:57,620
everybody hello hello i can't believe it it's real and it
didn't get silk song i was so surprised i was that was like

2
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,620
my number one fear i was like oh my god i hope it doesn't
get silk song where i cannot fucking even download this game

3
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:11,220
what is incredible is that this game is actually was 25
gigabytes to download and i've been so used to games being

4
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:19,400
80 plus gigabytes and taking fucking forever i was very
shocked um anyway i want the one i want to say is that i am

5
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,780
not sponsored by this game so i can say whatever i want um i
think it's because i did not have the best reaction to it

6
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:33,300
when i the trailer first launched so so i think that's why
they didn't really contact me to sponsor me because i think

7
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,480
like i know all my friends are sponsored to play this game
today for the launch event not all of them but i know some

8
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,780
of my friends they could tell me about this game and but i
think i think my initial reaction to this game was not very

9
00:02:46,780 --> 00:03:01,080
positive but to be fair i was expecting titan fall three to
be fair so so this will be my first reaction my first raw

10
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,420
reaction to this whole game um what else i'm just gonna rip
it right now because I want to know what it is.

11
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,560
This is the most mysterious.

12
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:18,660
And, like, it's the most mysterious and, like, no info ever
launch I've ever seen for a game like this.

13
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,840
So, it's going to be interesting.

14
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,900
I have no idea what to expect.

15
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,280
I do have a little bit what to expect, but I'll tell you
guys about it when we play the game.

16
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,940
It's like the, I swear, it's such a weird launch.

17
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,300
It's like, it's so weird.

18
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:44,710
yeah yeah there's not a lot of info going off of this game
also i don't know if a sound guy is a lot but get ready to

19
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:57,010
balance this oh it has easy anti-cheat it's just like apex
oh my god um who even made this it is x respawn dev so x

20
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:04,270
apex slash titan fall developers that made this game they
invited a bunch of people over a bunch of fps players over

21
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:13,730
to check it out and a lot of invited to the event itself um
i won't spoil things until we're in the game um because like

22
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:26,630
you know you know i don't like obviously like it's not
something i can't tell yet and like jeff was incredibly

23
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:36,210
cocky um about this whole thing like he was like i'm gonna
prove you guys right you guys gonna have to say so and i

24
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:44,710
will say like i said if the game is actually really fun and
really good i'll eat my words i'll be like you oh my god i i

25
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:52,110
i thought i was gonna fall for it again but oh my god it was
actually a decent game i will say i will admit i will admit

26
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,870
fall if it was actually a really good game it was just it
didn't really have the best marketing if i mean to be fair

27
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:05,590
it didn't have the best marketing turned into like a fucking
amazing marketing because there's so much mystery

28
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:14,970
surrounding it um there was just so much mystery and like uh
surrounding this whole game and people being like is it even

29
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,430
gonna be alive and then that became the marketing because
people now are like so fucking curious it was just it was

30
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,910
like the craziest marketing strategy and then suddenly
they're like bam we actually invited a bunch of creators to

31
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:42,490
check this game out i'm like oh my what i was just like wait
a secret creator event was happening as well oh it's a

32
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,790
battle pass free that's cool enemy we're seeing a horse is
really fun too i was just i was concerned about that i was

33
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:58,870
like i don't know if i want to shoot on a horse all right
i'm in the queue i should boot it up this game faster i'm in

34
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:13,270
the queue i will be i have very low expectations going in um
but i will um if it's good i will admit fall to it oh i'm in

35
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:28,170
oh man it does feel very apex slash paladin-y i think it's
the horse it's the horse isn't it all right let's see

36
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:36,670
apparently um i did ask my friends like which class seemed
the most fun to play but then like i think they went i

37
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:47,290
forgot i was trying to ask that but they went to bed before
i could um apparently the strongest weapons though is the

38
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:55,710
the shotgun and the sniper which whatever one is the sniper
i don't know which one it is i assume it's the ranger

39
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:03,610
they're telling me that shotgun and the ranger was the
strongest weapons in the game oh my god wait 10 out of 10 i

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,530
How do I?

76
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,330
Alright.

77
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,110
We gotta learn how to play.

78
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,410
Oh, I guess I can't yet.

79
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,930
I gotta learn how to play first.

80
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,590
Alright.

81
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,270
Okay, now I can actually talk about this.

82
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,330
It's 3v3.

83
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,850
That was the one thing my friends did tell me that I could
get still quick.

84
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:17,050
It's that uh it is 3v3 it's not 3v3v3v3 it's just 3v3 so
it's very geared towards pre i feel like that's really

85
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:25,910
geared towards uh pre-mains and not like a very it might not
be a very fun solo queue experience over time right now

86
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:34,630
because it is launched a lot of people are playing it so um
um yeah i i thought i honestly i personally think that it

87
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:41,570
would be more fun if there's Or if it's more like 3v3, 3v3,
like it's like bedwars, you know, like constant action.

88
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,510
Like they said it's already constant action with it being
3v3.

89
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,310
Yeah, it's like arenas, basically.

90
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,210
Here we are.

91
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,650
Oh my god.

92
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,250
Oh my god.

93
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,310
The worst part is like there's no sense conversion.

94
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,270
Oh my god.

95
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,990
Because of how fucking mysterious.

96
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,350
How fucking mysterious this launch was.

97
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,390
I have no.

98
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,150
There's no.

99
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,950
There's no current like sense conversion for this.

100
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,330
Nobody knows.

101
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,190
Nobody knows the sense for this.

102
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,510
It just feels like arenas, I feel it.

103
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,670
Alright, use Mantle to climb the walls.

104
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,550
Alright, I know.

105
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,290

Surprisingly, there is...

109
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,690
I actually asked about this, and there's no tap strafe.

110
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,550
There is bunny hop.

111
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,010
There is bunny hop, though.

112
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,910

That is a good question.

178
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,230
I should have tried that.

179
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,430

It says fortify your base and I'm like, bro, no.

188
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,890

It is also Siege.

192
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,670
Walk up to a wall to reinforce it with iron.

193
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,830
Right.

194
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,790
Our knocking base...

195
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,410
It's time to get out there and find gear.

196
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,430
Alright, gotta find gear now.

197
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,430
How the...

198
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,010
I need to know how to sheave my weapons, honestly.

199
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,990
I'm, like, really curious.

200
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,870
Charge, aim, switch weapons.

201
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:12,650
Uh...

202
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,930
I just want to do this.

203
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,030
Uh...

204
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,290
Obede, cancel.

205
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,510
Yeah, I'm gonna swap.

206
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,330
Change that.

207
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,510
Because I want to...

208
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,250
Is there no sheaving the weapon?

209
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,330
I feel like there is it.

210
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:25,790
I don't...

211
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:37,470
see it at all i don't know unless i'm crazy i do not see it
i i actually don't see anything about like about like

212
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:50,390
fucking making sure my weapon like there's melee but that's
it oh ride my horse yeah okay oh there's no like i guess

213
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:56,130
like what's it called recoil when i'm shooting it doesn't
look like there's recoil when you're shooting on the horse.

214
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,170
But then it's like, imagine the fucking horse fights that
you have.

215
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,070
Oh yeah, there is definitely not.

216
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:03,530
Yeah.

217
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,870
Yeah, there is no recoil when you're shooting from your
horse.

218
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,530
Alright, blue armor, hammer charge.

219
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,950
Zipline gun.

220
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,490
What the fuck?

221
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:34,930
oh my god wait oh it's one ammo it's one bullet and a dream
all right so i can make my own zip like oh my god wait is

222
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:48,690

guns are so easy i will say that you can't really spam

223
00:20:48,690 --> 00:21:02,250
crouch though it's very slow i will say like i will say this
movement is very slow yeah i will say that but like there

224
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:13,110
this there's no recoil there is no recoil look look it's so
easy to aim with this gun i will say it's very easy to aim

225
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:23,950
with this fucking gun we like oh my god brothers this is way
too easy

226
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:38,350
whoa reinforcement like like i could very i don't even know
what my sense is but this is so easy to control all right

227
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:49,430
let's see rocky launcher oh okay my friends did tell me this
gun is very strong like when it's fully wait what that's

228
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:55,910
like on the head is oh okay so it has to be lower This is
fully geared.

229
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,530
Oh, is that full auto?

230
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,590
They said the full auto sniper was like the best gun.

231
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,170
So I'm not sure.

232
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,350
That's what they told me.

233
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,310
So I'm not sure if this is the actual full auto.

234
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,170
Alright, let's try.

235
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,130
Let's try the...

236
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,830
Let's try if there's rocket jump.

237
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,350
There's no rocket jump.

238
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,120
There's no rocket jump.

239
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,120
Okay, let's see.

240
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,920
Okay, head.

241
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:41,040
okay i'm trying to see like 140 all right yeah that is
strong if you hit them consistently yeah what we've learned

242
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:52,300
is that there is no is there fall damage no fall damage all
right that's good to know no fall damage whoops there's no

243
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:58,500
cooldown oh wait there is there's no cooldown for a horse
mount i mean two It's barely a cooldown for it.

244
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,060
Yeah.

245
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,760
What about grenade jumps?

246
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,460
Alright, let's try.

247
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,400
I don't think there is, but like, I'll humor you guys.

248
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,100
You can sort of tell they're in, but I'll humor you.

249
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,120
Alright.

250
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,320
Then rocket ammo.

251
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,740
What's this?

252
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,520
What gun is this?

253
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,000
I don't like that gun.

254
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,100
Going back to my R9.

255
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,360
Open the inventory?

256
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:33,800
Alright.

257
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
Let's grab one more piece.

258
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,900
Try visiting the trader.

259
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,560
Alright.

260
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,560
Over here, Warden.

261
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,200
Let's get you all armoured up.

262
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,880
Wait, let's see.

263
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,440
Yeah, there's quick scope.

264
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,380
Right next to me.

265
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,140
There is quick scope.

266
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,300
Which is, like, pretty good.

267
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,880
That's good.

268
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,880
Because, like, I remember I heard in Overwatch, they got rid
of quickscoping.

269
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,860
So if you were good at quickscoping, then you can quickscope
for this game.

270
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,280
Yeah.

271
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,400
Is there bullet drop?

272
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,320
That is a good question.

273
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,160
Let's try it out.

274
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,920
This doesn't seem like it's bullet dropped.

275
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,720
There's no bullet drop.

276
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,720
You see this?

277
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,220
My crosser is on the head.

278
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,280
My crosser...

279
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
My crosser was on the head.

280
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,200
head.

281
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,340
All right, let's see for this guy.

282
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,460
Yeah, there's no bullet drop.

283
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,160
Okay, I get it.

284
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,940
Now I know why this gun is OP.

285
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,180
Yeah, no.

286
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,980
On the head, it hits.

287
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,560
It fucking hits.

288
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,040
There we go.

289
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,940
There might be like, wait, I think there is, oh no, 65.

290
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,840
Yeah, 65 damage.

291
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,340
There might be, um, what's the word?

292
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,300
Fall, um, though.

293
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
I think there's falloff.

294
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,620
There's no bullet drop, but there's falloff.

295
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,640
Because it's 55, 100.

296
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,360
Yeah, so, like, the further it is, damage, there is damage
falloff, but there's no bullet drop.

297
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,000
So, it hits again.

298
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,320
There's falloff damage, yeah.

299
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,020
Yeah.

300
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,680
I mean, that's fair.

301
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,040
I would say that's fair.

302
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,440
But imagine if you had three people with that gun.

303
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,080
Imagine if you had three people There you go.

304
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,540
It'd be like, pop, pop, pop.

305
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,320
Don't stand still.

306
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,780
All right, let's see.

307
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,780
I need, oh, do I need more?

308
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,260
All right, I need more ore.

309
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,140
God damn it.

310
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,960
I'm so bad at this.

311
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,160
I don't play dead by daylight.

312
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,540
Oh, shit.

313
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:50,920
Oops.

314
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,340
All right.

315
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,160
Can I hit your pet?

316
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh, yeah, very close.

317
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,880
All right, I'll buy that then.

318
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,720
It's up, Warden.

319
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,020
Sorry about this.

320
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,160
Or Osu.

321
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,900
Don't play Osu.

322
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,520
Wow!

323
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,960
Sorry about that one, Pet.

324
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,800
Oh.

325
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,360
That if you get taken out like that, the armor you've got on
breaks.

326
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,080
This is why multiple armor sets is a good idea.

327
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,320
What?

328
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,620
He's like invincible!

00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,260

330
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,820
I think you're ready.

331
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,060
Alright, respawn base.

332
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,800
Choose your spawn point and head back to base.

333
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,380
Uh...

334
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,140
I mean, this is base, isn't it?

335
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,460
This is my base.

336
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,400
The storm's forming the shield breaker.

337
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:49,410

Is this an auto-sniper?

342
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,250
No?

343
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,890
A semi-auto.

344
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,910
Guys, I don't know anything about guns.

345
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,910
I would assume like this...

346
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,010
I don't know which one is the full-auto sniper.

347
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,830
Guys, I just know about make-believe guns.

348
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,390
I don't know anything about real guns.

349
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,400
I just know the fantasy guns.

350
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,060
Alright.

351
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,300
I got the shield breaker.

352
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,600
Now take the shield breaker to the enemy base.

353
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:49,980
Wee!

354
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,500
Oh, I thought I could ride the zip line with my horse.

355
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,540
Rack-a-kaka-kaka-kaka equals...

356
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:56,740
Okay.

357
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,840
Alright, that understood.

358
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,540
I want to see if there's any guns I haven't tried yet.

359
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,400
Paladins.

360
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,880
I haven't tried this yet.

361
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,460
I don't like that gun.

362
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,540
I wish, like, I could just try with...

363
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,020
I guess you can when...

364
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,460
Oh, is there items in these barrels, though?

365
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,420
I want to know.

366
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,960
No items in these barrels.

00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,360
idea what solo mode.

406
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,140
I feel like I'm going to get yelled at a lot.

407
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,900
Watch the video.

408
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,380
Okay, let me see what this video is before we watch it.

409
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,400
What do you mean watch the video for advanced tips?

410
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,800
Oh, okay.

411
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,080
There you go.

412
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,780
I thought it was going to pop me up to YouTube.

413
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,600
Advanced briefing time.

414
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,280
Okay, I'm going through my HR training.

415
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,120
I'm going to HR training right now, guys.

416
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,100
I'm like, workflow.

417
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,180
Yeah, I got hires.

418
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:31,920
suits your unique skills and tactics now once you've settled
into a base the defensive phase will begin all right the

419
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:38,780
defensive phase here you'll have a short window to change
okay oh my god this is like arena this actually is like

420
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:45,160
arena important they're usually found deep inside surrounded
by destructive This is the siege part.

421
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,140
Use your wall reinforcements to protect those generators.

422
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,460
That's the easiest place to start securing your base.

423
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,040
When the dome unlocks, I'll give you the signal and we're
off.

424
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,580
Oh my god, the bear's so cool, though.

425
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,940
The bear's so fucking cool.

426
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,680
Phase one, gear up.

427
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,220
Phase two, intercept.

428
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,580
And lastly, phase three, raid.

429
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,580
basically gathering armor and upgrading your weapons first
so it's actually whoever gets the sword force scattered

430
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:28,300
around loot all the resources you can before charging into a
fight don't forget to harvest oh yeah it's like the pre-show

431
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:36,800
at Disney Reds now we're minecrafting we're mining and
crafting once you have the shield breaker rally up your team

432
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:45,360
and ride out to the enemy base this marks the beginning of
phase two intercept in the intercept phase whoever has the

433
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,640
shield breaker will be trying to ride with it to the
opposing base and break in okay the team tries to stop them

434
00:32:51,640 --> 00:33:01,760
again teamwork is invaluable stick together bro that gun
looks strong oh wait I could jump fast with my okay that's

435
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:13,560
sick that's looking sick if you do you will drop the shield
breaker and But if no one plants before it's platoon, it's

436
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,960
rainmaker shield breaker rainmaker.

437
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:31,300
That's the splatoon portion It's the splatoon part It's the
rainmaker And try not to let our clock run out It's also

438
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:41,520
splatoon To the nearest base for zero damage And the raid
will begin the splatoon phase During a raid, you'll need to

439
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,040
work together to successfully...

440
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,080
This game has everything, guys.

441
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,300
Maybe Jett is right.

442
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,340
Oh, that's...

443
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,160
Those players are so shit, man.

444
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,220
Wait, if I have the what?

445
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,160
Be smart.

446
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,560
Plan with your team.

447
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,220
Coordinate and unite those powers for devastating effect.

448
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,140
Oh, my God.

449
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,380
That's actually, like, Jett.

450
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,520
I'm actually really bad at project out, though.

451
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,520
Oh, my God.

452
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,300
Wait, that's...

453
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,420
Wait, that looks like hit-scatter.

454
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,440
Look on mastering these tips and you will become a true
warden of high guard.

455
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,400
I'm gonna become the true warden of high guard.

456
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,980
Where's the marble rival?

457
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,860
See, this is the best part about not being sponsored.

458
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,860
I can just name out random games and they'll be like, they
won't be mad at me.

How am I finding a match in Fire and Range?

470
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,460
It's just me.

471
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,460
Okay, there we go.

472
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,180
I was going to say, it's literally only me in the Fire and
Range.

473
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,200
What match are you trying to find for me?

474
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,820
I feel like Una is, like not Una, whoever the fucking girl,

475
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,560

476
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,600

Alright.

We don't know, I don't fucking know, smugglers then.

480
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,000
Oh my god.

481

Wait, what?

482
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,920
Did I not queue up fire range?

483
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,940
Oh, I can I can queue.

484
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,640
Oh, it's like my own custom fire range.

485
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,860
I see.

486
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,440
How do I swap?

487
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
beast's job is to survive.

488
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,500
How do I swap heroes?

489
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,760
What the fuck?

490
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Customize range, change warden.

491
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,640
There you go, change warden.

492
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,040
Okay.

493
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,180
There's no quick set for it, it feels like.

494
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,180
Alright.

495
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,320

Disappear!

499
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:35,900
Alright.

500
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,660
That's her disappearing.

501
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,500
Oh, so she's like literally not literally disappear.

502
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,860
All right.

503
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,400
E.

504
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,640
I'm pressing E.

505
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,680
Oh, doors on me close when the raid starts.

506
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,580
I'm pressing E.

507
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,520
What the fuck?

508
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,080
All right, customized range.

509
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,160
Let's make this hard for you.

510
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,700
I wanted...

511
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,880
Okay, I do want to max out my ult.

512
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,940
Where the fuck is the ult max out?

513
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,340
Can I not max it out?

514
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,460
Do I actually have to wait?

515
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,180
Oh my god.

516
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,760
It says E.

517
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,300
Oh.

518
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,500
It says E!

519
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,340
What do you mean?

520
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,460
I'm pressing E, guys.

521
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,540
I swear to God, I am actually pressing E.

522
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,820
But there is no, like, way to get your ult really fast,
which...

523
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,840
Like, how the fuck it lets me...

524
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,560
There is more options.

525
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,680
Where is my more options?

526
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,700
I don't understand.

527
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,580
I don't understand.

528
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,280
Where's my more options?

529
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,380
All right, change loadout.

530
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,760
Marksman weapons.

531
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,120
Oh, it has...

532
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,760
Is it this?

533
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,840
What's big rig?

534
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,260
Holy shit, what the fuck is big rig?

535
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,440
Like, the fuck is a big rig.

536
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,400
Oh, wait.

537
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,340
That's like the...

538
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,560
What is that gun in Valorant?

539
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,140
That one gun in Valorant.

540
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,320
We all know that gun.

541
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,820
Okay, I can't hurt myself.

542
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,360
okay

543
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:27,760
that you know what I'm talking about that one the Odin this
is literally the Odin right now big rig alright so people

544
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:36,720
are telling me that shotgun is OP so let's try it oh wait
there's like a small boost when I get off okay when I get

545
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:48,540
off the horse that's cool alright let's try oh shit sorry oh
shit sorry oh yeah no the shotgun's insanely strong no it

546
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:58,080
just takes fucking forever to reload no yeah no it's like
fortnite it actually is like fortnite like the shotgun power

547
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:13,100
yeah i understand if you like if you can get the head then
it'd be like crazy i will say reloading is the bitch i might

548
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,000
i think my sense It's still a little too high.

549
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,680
I'm going to grab it down a little.

550
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,600
It feels a little too high.

551
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,280
You can't crouch spam in this game, which I don't know how I
feel.

552
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,840
But it's definitely...

553
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,300
Yeah, very heavy damage.

554
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,340
So if you're like a Fortnite player, you might actually be
really good at this game.

555
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,260
Because I was told...

556
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,660
Like, this is actually pretty...

557
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,660
That's a two-shot.

558
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,420
It's actually a two-shot if you're close.

559
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,620
Obviously, the further you are.

560
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,880
I mean, but I'm feeling like a peacekeeper.

561
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,520
Like, yeah.

562
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,520
There is a...

563
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,800
There is fallout here.

564
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,400
So...

565
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,660
It is strong, though.

566
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,360
I will say the peacekeeper, sorry.

567
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,500
The Kraken is very hard to look at us.

568
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,260
Like, what is it called?

569
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,480
The Kraken.

570
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,420
You can't crouch spam on this.

571
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,520
The crouch is so slow.

572
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,160
It's very, very slow.

573
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,820
Do I gain all charge from shooting at all?

574
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,080
No, I don't.

575
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,940
How do I gain all charge then?

576
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,540
It's just passive?

577
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,420
It feels like it's just passive.

578
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,380
I wonder.

579
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,500
I'm releasing.

580
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,400
Missing the Kraken.

581
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,880
Ah!

582
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,540
Yeah, no, the tea bagging is very slow.

583
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:55,900
There's no...

584
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,000
You can't fucking...

585
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,460
I don't like that I can't test out my ult.

586
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,780
There must...

587
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,940
I feel like there should be a way to, like, test out the
ult.

588
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,300
That's, like, the one...

589
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,880
My current criticism so far is that I just...

590
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,020
I want to test it out.

591
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,860
I want to know what my ult is.

592
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,940
But, like...

593
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,500
But, like, it's not giving me the opportunity.

594
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:26,700
option too yeah oh yeah no the ease i think the ease setting
i think they bugged it out because i'm pressing e and it

595
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:37,360
doesn't give me anything apparently i mean like my e is not
unbounded i have e up i mean i don't it's not yes the e is

596
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:46,300
bounded so uh oh wait there's emote's nice okay wait i
should all right i'm gonna do that here and then where's my

597
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,780
melee Okay, melee.

598
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,720
Ultimate power.

599
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,480
Oh, yeah, that's the summoning.

600
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:53,820
Yeah.

601
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,220
I am holding it.

602
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,860
I did try.

603
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,080
I tried holding it.

604
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,640
It didn't work.

605
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,160
But we're passively recharging our thing right now.

606
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,460
Yeah, I just want to see...

607
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,860
I want to see...

608
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,380
Like, her alt.

609
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,620
That's all I want to know.

610
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,880
Like, please.

611
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,760
Please, sir.

612
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,440
Can I check her alt out?

613
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,860
It's very...

614
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:31,780
easy to aim in this game like so far from my like so far
from me testing out all the guns it seems very easy to like

615
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:42,400
aim but i'm not but that's just my initial opinion on it so
like i'm not sure if it actually it actually is but it feels

616
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:50,440
very easy aimable um let me try this and then Oh, longhorn.

617
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,660
Have I tried this yet?

618
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,540
This feels more like an...

619
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,980
Actually, this feels like a R9, too.

620
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,080
Was this...

621
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,010
Yeah, this feels...

622
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,490
This is the R9 for me.

623
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:11,490
Oh, wait.

624
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,010
Alt's ready?

625
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,150
Alright, let's try it.

626
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,250
Alt is ready.

627
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:16,830
Oh, wait.

628
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:17,530
That's not the alt.

629
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:18,370
That's stealth mode.

630
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,910
Who's the alt button again?

631
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:23,470
Fuck.

632
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,550

Yeah, no, that's literally Jets.

637
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,410
Like, in Apex.

638
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,050
What was... I don't know what was Q.

639
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,470
What was her... What was the abilities for...

640
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,390
Oh, reloading ammo fills up.

641
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,070
Does it?

642
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,850
No, it doesn't.

643
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,710
No, it doesn't.

644
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,010
Oh, oh, refill!

Oh, okay.

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,090
That's that's weird.

651
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:32,990
That's so weird.

652
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:33,730
But what was okay?

653
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:42,750

Okay, recon.

676
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,830
He'll be like, tell me where the enemies are.

677
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,410
It's like me sending my Raven out in Apex.

678
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,410
Picking up nothing.

679
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,510
All right, but how far is the range?

680
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,170
It's not that.

681
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,990
It's like she's just fucking closing a circle.

682
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,610
I wish I could tell what the range is for the Eagle.

683
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:22,450
But...

684
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,470
All right.

685
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,390

damage that shit looks OP as hell.

691
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,310
Alright, yeah, like...

692
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,730
Oh, wait.

693
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:32,090
Fucking... I need to figure out the aim with this though.

694
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,830
Like, I'm like, how the fuck?

695
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:37,350
Okay.

696
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,990
What the...

697
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,270
There's, there's like a...

698
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,850
So, you see how I'm throwing... That's the cross here?

699
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,850
It goes higher.

700
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,210
So it's so weird.

701
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,590
It's actually weird.

702
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,130
It's higher than what it should be.

703
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,030
What it's... What it's said in the thing.

704
00:47:53,510 --> 00:48:07,590
okay and then oh my god i'm the god of thunder okay i wonder
if it's easy to shoot him down i feel like i feel like it's

705
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:18,210
very easy to shoot this man down if we all just look at him
i i don't know if i'm op but like i wonder if like if i

706
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:24,590
still have my hp so far yeah everyone just has to look feel
like he's a giant.

707
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,510
His damage is insane, though.

708
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:27,750
It looks sick.

709
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,210
It looks fucking... I could try here.

710
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:33,870
Wait, let's see.

711
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:35,590
But what if they don't know where I am?

712
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,290
You're so right.

713
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,150
You're so right.

714
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,310
What if I do it from here?

715
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:39,670
Let's see.

716
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,330
Oh my god.

717
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:42,030
Keep pressing here.

718
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,030
Oh my god.

719
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,290
Wait, I can... Wait, what if?

720
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,650
Wait, I have an idea.

721
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:51,690
Wait, what if?

722
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,090
Wait, how far does this go?

723
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,310
Oh my god, wait, that hits!

724
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:02,970
Wait!

725
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,370
From the far!

726
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:09,690
That's crazy!

727
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:11,490
What?

728
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:12,950
I see the vision.

729
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,350
Wait, I see the fucking vision.

730
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:19,410
Wait, I can snipe rocket, like, missile incoming.

731
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,590
I'm setting a fucking...

732
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,130
I have your location.

733
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,390
Like, my teammate will be like, It's he's over here!

734
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,630
He's over here!

735
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:26,550
I'm like...

736
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,330
I'm like, target, locked.

737
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,190
Boom!

738
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:36,930
Artillery strike.

739
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,870
I do not think there was damage fallout to that.

740
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:41,890
That hit, like, a hundred.

741
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:43,090
Yeah.

742
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,370
From downtown.

743
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,750
The drones are coming.

744
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,390
Alright, who is him?

745
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,550
He repairs broken walls.

746
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:53,010
Oh!

747
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:54,510
That's...

748
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:55,610
What's her name?

749
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:00,850
The guy, the girl that repairs doors creates an ice wall.

750
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:01,470
All right.

751
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,770
I literally, it's like two apex characters in one.

752
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,540
Yeah, she's like, uh, no, no, like.

753
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,240
Oh, yeah, that's May's ice wall.

754
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,800
But like, I meant the apex character where she can reinforce
the walls.

755
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,680
I forgot what her name is.

756
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,520
Wait, what the fuck?

757
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:23,820
How?

758
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:31,520
Okay, these ices are very, okay, I will say they are very,
easy it's catalyst yeah catalyst and me because she like he

759
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:39,940

though these walls are not strong as hell all right now i'm

760
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:40,980
letting the beast out

764
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,300

765
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,740
I'm so scared.

766
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,240
Wait, this was, y'all, all the way up.

767
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,880
I'm so scared.

768
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,280
He is...

769
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,380
No, no, I just didn't start running.

770
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,240
No, I was just casually walking.

771
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,080
I can actually run in this form.

772
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,800
He's walking slowly towards me.

773
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:59,280
You know, like, in, like, horror films, you're like, oh,
thank God, he could just slowly walk to you and then he just

774
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:10,760
starts fucking running and you're like wait you're not
supposed to do that um okay this says over shield and

775
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:19,600
creates a spawn for it okay this one is just this is the
only support character so i just give people over shield i i

776
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:26,600
mean like the souls of the fallen fortify you well does that
mean i have to actually be able it i have to be able to aim

777
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:34,900
the overshield okay all right take this so long okay oh no i
could just throw oh i throw it on the ground and you can

780
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:56,540
just creates it's not really anything you get it's like you
literally find it i think it's like you find the sword and

781
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:04,720
then you throw like your spawn i'm pretty sure like that's
how you do it yeah so you're like all right um you you see

782
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,980
the sword to do the sword break or what i'm sorry there's so
many terms you do the sword break to grab the sword and

783
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:21,200
you're like guys i got the spawn go in go go go go yeah come
get your arm yeah i would think i don't know how long last

784
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:30,940
for it though it doesn't say how long this lasts for um but
i feel like that's how you play that's the spawn point all

785
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:41,580
right last character what is this guy i think i'm gonna try

No, it hurts these guys.

795
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,580
Okay, I was gonna say, I swear to God, is there friendly
fire in my own goddamn oven when I'm fucking...

796
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:05,480
He feels garbage, but maybe, like, in-game, it's better,
but, like, his cooldown sucks.

797
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,340
34, like...

798
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,500
34 seconds?

799
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,380
That shit is long.

800
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:13,960
Yeah.

801
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,580
He feels...

802
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,920
Alright, let's actually play a game.

803
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,500
Leave match.

804
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,940
Alright, let's see what I get yelled at.

805
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,940
Oh, he's got...

806
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,560
What?

807
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,760
I don't...

808
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,260
No!

809
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:38,980
I just left the training grounds, and they're like, alright,
that's enough for you.

810
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,260
You gotta go back in line.

811
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,520
You gotta go back in line now.

812
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,460
I wanted to play a game, for real.

813
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,000
Let's check out the characters.

814
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,640
Alright, let me grab water real quick while we're waiting in
Login Q.

815
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:52,940
Okay.

816
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:57,530
I can't believe I can't believe they kicked me out I should
have stayed I should have stayed in the training grounds and

817
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:10,570
just never played a game I guess I guess I I should have I
should have stayed there and just looking out that was my

818
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:14,910
gameplay for the day yeah I high-guarded too hard

819
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:21,730
They are taking like aspects of other games to create this.

820
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:29,070
I will say from the PR, from the HR video, I watched the
training video that we watched together.

821
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:36,430
The game mode, I mean, it's sort of like arena, but not
really.

822
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:39,090
It's like arena, but like we're sieging.

823
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:39,870
We're breaching.

824
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:42,970
All right.

825
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,670
How long is the log?

826
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:47,290
How long is the login queue, guys?

827
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:59,470
for it or is it i can't believe it i think it's just like
too many people are on right now it's 3v3 it's 3v3 my cue

828
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:13,450
was a while oh no i just i just wanted to check out the
characters individually no i was in the i was in the

829
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:17,570
training grounds earlier just checking each character out
and their abilities and everything.

830
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:22,510
For now, it seems like Kai, the Ice Hulk, is the strongest.

831
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:26,410
Because, like, 1,000 damage for...

832
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,110
Like, what the fuck?

833
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,030
That's insane!

834
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,150
1,000...

835
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:35,950
Bro, the fucking fire guy sends out his ult, and it lasts,
like, five seconds.

836
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:39,010
Hulk Man can be in Hulk mode for a thousand...

837
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:40,250
For, like, one minute.

838
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:43,250

I didn't realize that's how fast the respawn rate is.

1014
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:31,260
Yeah.

1015
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,100
I didn't realize.

1016
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,040
There's such a fast respawn.

1017
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,440
Holy shit.

1018
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,840
That respawn is so goddamn fast.

1019
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,560
I'm still so sad.

1020
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,440
I should have won that.

1021
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,320
I now know why his shotgun is so goddamn strong.

1022
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,280
An enemy bomb is counting down.

1023
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,360
Diffuse it.

1024
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,700
Where is...

1025
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,160
I can fear him.

1026
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,840
Oh my god, it's like below me.

1027
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,270
I don't know where they are.

1028
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,240
Oh my god.

1029
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:12,800
Scanning coming.

1030
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:13,800
Holy shit!

1031
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,020
This is a 1v3.

1032
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:16,380
Ah!

1033
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:17,960
First last.

1034
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,280
That's insane.

1035
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,880
I've got to respawn like on their base.

1036
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,460
Yeah, they came back so fucking fast.

1037
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,940
That's insane how fast they come back.

1038
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,760
Also, my ult took so long.

1039
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,900
I wonder just because I died, I wonder.

1040
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,340
Is it because I died that it's like...

1041
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,800
Okay, I got a fucking...

1042
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,140
Oh, shit.

1043
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:46,250
Yeah, no, sniper just wasn't it for me.

1044
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,490
I'm also like white armor right now.

1045
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,030
I'm fucking white armor.

1046
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,510
Where the fuck is the last guy?

1047
01:10:58,770 --> 01:10:59,910
Their siege tower is done.

1048
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:00,990
Now let's clear him out.

1049
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:02,210
Oh my god.

1050
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:05,030
It feels like league when it comes to like the sieging part.

1051
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:05,930
Yeah.

1052
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:08,390
Because now that we defended it.

1053
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:09,250
They got us team.

1054
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:11,030
Let's ready ourselves for the next one.

1055
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:12,230
One out of three.

1056
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:12,590
Okay.

1057
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:13,650
Let's repair.

1058
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,750
Alright.

1059
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:17,810
Repair time.

1060
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:19,170
Don't worry.

1061
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,830
I'm fucking repairing the wall.

1062
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:21,430
It's like yeah.

1063
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,230
Let's reinforce.

1064
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,170
Okay.

1065
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:24,810
So.

1066
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:31,330
So this does feel a little bit like league in terms of like
the back and forth.

1067
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:35,190
Definitely armor.

1068
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:36,510
Purple helmet.

1069
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,730
I'm not a fan of.

1070
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,430
I don't know if I'm a fan of this.

1071
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:44,790
Yeah.

1072
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:51,270
I'm still so mad because I could have fucking won that first
initial fight.

1073
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:56,110
That makes me so mad because like if I didn't lag out, I win
that one fight.

1074
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:09,030
one 100 percent i'm gonna swap oh my god okay never mind
that's a purple ranger i just not have a chance to fucking

1075
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:22,630
not a chance to like fucking use my sniper all right we're
gonna loot real quick van guard all right

1076
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:27,550
Actually, I'm gonna buy it.

1077
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:28,330
Get one of them.

1078
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:28,730

1079
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:30,110
Alright.

1080
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:34,810
Yeah, these matches are long.

1081
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,130
I guess unless you're like...

1082
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,490
Are you fucking here already?

1083
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:44,010
Alright.

1084
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,350

1085
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,110
Who shot him?

1086
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:52,110
Where did they shoot me from?

1087
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:55,150
Oh, I hear them.

loud i will say i don't know if i like this sniper like

1094
01:13:52,790 --> 01:14:00,490

would be easier honestly what what

1095
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:09,660
I hear him, he's close.

1096
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,000
Alright.

1097
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,700
I don't get hurt from this.

1098
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:19,460
I actually do.

1099
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,300
Wait, what?

1100
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,200
That's it.

1101
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:38,330
There's no way.

1102
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:39,850
There's no way I saw.

1103
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:43,210
Oh my god, there's no fucking way.

1104
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,530
What do you mean?

1105
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,250
This doesn't do a thousand.

1106
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:47,610
What?

1107
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,170
It doesn't do a thousand in the end?

1108
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:53,710
What was the point of the training ground?

1109
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,510
What was the point?

1110
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,610
The training ground showed a thousand.

1111
01:14:58,810 --> 01:14:59,510
I got scammed.

1112
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,510
I got scammed so hard.

1113
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:02,950
Holy shit.

1114
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,330
That is actually such a fucking scam.

1115
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,230
The guy had arm in the training ground.

1116
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,530
It was a thousand with armor.

1117
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:14,910
What a fucking scam.

1118
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:15,670
I'm going Uma.

1119
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:23,810
going umma that is actually a goddamn scam yeah now the
other else look better i was gonna say like if i do a

01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:33,850

just to find out that it's not even a thousand in the match

1121
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:54,570
oh my god there you go reloading taking some damage oh i
wanted i was cocky i thought i could kill him i thought i

1122
01:15:54,570 --> 01:16:03,970
could kill him 10 hits critical i thought he was so low he's
not that low it's so hard to gauge the hp it's so hard to

1123
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:13,030
gauge the hp of people so i keep thinking like oh he's low
yeah i definitely need a shotgun shotgun is so op

1124
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:23,550
I'm like, I feel like I'm understanding it a bit more.

1125
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,910
I'm definitely understanding this a bit more though, for
real.

1126
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:30,330
Not my sense.

1127
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:32,150
This is not my sense though.

1128
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:38,230
Come on, go to it.

1129
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:40,190
Yeah.

1130
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:43,610
Jesus Christ.

1131
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:47,110
I'm re-genning, I'm re-genning my HP.

1132
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:57,110
I need to find my sense for this goddamn shit for Shreel.

1133
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:59,270
I'm not a huge fan.

1134
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:02,510
All right.

1135
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:07,530
Got him?

1136
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:09,030
All right.

1137
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:13,930
I don't know if it's like too fast, if it's like too fast or
not.

1138
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:15,610
Yeah, these guys can aim.

1139
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:18,890
I'm still so mad.

1140
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:19,370
I could.

1141
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:21,850
Planting a thumper charge.

1142
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,210
Planting a thumper charge?

1143
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,990
I'm freaking...

1144
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:37,990
I'm breaching now for real I'm breaching oh my god they're
around me aren't they

to me I don't find it that long.

1149
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:29,550
Oh, raid ending soon.

1150
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:35,630
You have six lives for that respawn, though?

1151
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:38,310
Oh, raid is ending soon.

1152
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,150
Oh, out of attack.

1153
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:44,950
Oh, so it, like, just tells you how many lives you get.

1154
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:47,830
Oh, oh my god, I could have botched shit too.

1155
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,590
Oh my god, there's bi-phases during your raid.

1156
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:53,110
There's fucking bi-phases.

1157
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:54,230
Oh my god.

1158
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:56,730
This game is...

1159
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,510
This game is complicated.

1160
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:00,190
It does take a lot to learn.

1161
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:03,370
Um...

1162
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:04,610
Um...

1163
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:09,590
I remember reading the thing and they said that it takes a
while to learn this game mode.

1164
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:10,770
And I understand now.

1165
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,510
I want to get rid of my ranger.

1166
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,270
Use this time wisely.

1167
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:17,350
Oh my god, the dynasty armor level 4.

1168
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:19,970
Okay, you can buy armor during all of that.

1169
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,310
Alright, I'm looking...

1170
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,650
Yeah.

1171
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:26,990
No, it's literally just 3v3.

1172
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:29,530
Yeah, this game takes a while.

1173
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,470
Like, I'm, like, figuring things out.

1174
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:33,830
Like, the more times I die.

1175
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:35,530
Also, Hulk...

1176
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,590
Hulk mode is not good.

1177
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:38,730
Like, I feel like I got lied to.

1178
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:42,030
I feel like...

1179
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:44,510
I feel like I fucking got lied to.

1180
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:45,590
I got scammed.

1181
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:48,150
On the training ground, it was, like, a thousand damage.

1182
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,690
I was like, Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

1183
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:50,490
That is insane.

1184
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:54,230
And then, in the end, it, like, it wasn't even actually
that.

1185
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:57,510
Damn, we're having a rocket launcher.

1186
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,170
What the fuck?

1187
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:00,230
Yeah, hell yeah.

1188
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:01,410
Give me...

1189
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:02,610
Yeah.

1190
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:05,690
The 1k damage scammed me.

1191
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:08,590
I feel like this seems like a pre-made, not gonna lie.

1192
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:11,870
Like, those guys are so coordinated.

1193
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:13,830
They, like, literally are...

1194
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:15,270
They feel really coordinated.

1195
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:19,590
But now I also know that they respawned next to me after I
killed two.

1196
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,430
I was like, what the fuck?

1197
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,010
I know a lot of people are pre-mining, so I don't know.

1198
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:30,950
It can always be a possibility.

1199
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:32,710
One second.

1200
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:36,530
Do I can grab it, or do you think I'm going to get fucked
up?

1201
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,780
The footsteps are loud as hell, though, I will say.

1202
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:49,990
Enemy spotted.

1203
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:52,670
Grenade out.

1204
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:57,630
I'm out.

1205
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:58,530
Let's ride.

1206
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:00,170
Oh, yeah.

1207
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:01,190
I got...

1208
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,190
I don't think I can grab the loot.

1209
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:05,230
I don't think so.

1210
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:07,930
I think they're just chilling here.

1211
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:11,490
The shield breakers forming.

1212
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:13,090
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the shield breaker.

1213
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:16,770
And they went to grab the good loot too, which sucks.

1214
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,340
Oh my god.

1215
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:24,960
I have to run.

1216
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,160
I can't believe they're all there, too.

1217
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,260
Fucking nerds.

1218
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,100
Actual nerds.

1219
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,800
Walking together as a team.

1220
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,560
Oh, I left my guy.

1221
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:38,580
Sorry, buddy, buddy.

1222
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,840
They're coming over to my guy.

1223
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,880
I'm going to come over.

1224
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,000
This sucks.

1225
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,500
This guy's actually is here.

1226
01:21:59,500 --> 01:21:59,800
Oh, my God.

1227
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,640
Fucking course they pass through the moment I look away.

1228
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,240
This always happens.

1229
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:06,280
I can't believe it.

1230
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:13,580
Shield breakers ready, don't let the enemy planted or it's
over.

1231
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,780
Are you serious?

1232
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,680
Oh my god, he flanked!

1233
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:22,080
Oh my god, Dr. Christie!

1234
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,760
Oh, he flanked me.

1235
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,920
Oh, I got flanked hard!

1236
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,940
Are you serious?

1237
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,720
Bro, these guys, they have to be calming.

1238
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:36,780
They have to be calming, yeah.

1239
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,120
Yeah.

1240
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,980
These guys, they can flank the shit out of me.

1241
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,360
I'm gonna try and use the longhorn.

1242
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,460
We gotta play together, guys.

1243
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,260
I don't know.

1244
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,740
I feel like I don't know which this guy is strong.

1245
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:54,840
What the fuck?

1246
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:55,920
Why is my horse so now?

1247
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,960
Do I want to go back?

1248
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:58,520
Oh, okay.

1249
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,620
I mean, I'm not gonna fight 1v3.

1250
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,700
I think it's more...

1251
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,760
It's definitely more fun as a pre-made, for sure.

1252
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:21,060
think this is this is definitely not oh my god oh my god I
fucked up the wall are you fucking kidding me I could

1253
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:27,980
teleport the base what oh what I was gonna say I could
teleport back like

1254
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:40,600
yeah no solo queue is rough I have my initial thoughts if
you have a pre-made I can see this fun yeah spawns are

1255
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:47,700
locking soon only a few seconds before overtime this is
definitely a play with friends i will agree i'm back you can

1256
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:57,800
trust me let's do this i don't know bro this longhorn sucks
what the fuck we lost this location

1257
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:11,180
i think if i have a pre-made i think this game would be very
very fun i think the lack of pre-mate also i was a garbage

1258
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:19,600
character too i would say the games are a lot i oh it's not
a bit oh my god i was in the barrier like i said like are

1259
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:27,020
you okay every game apparently every game kicks you out of
the you have to rejoin the queue i guess like day two it

1260
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:35,320
would be different pre-mades it's like if it's 3v3 like they
i know a lot of like streamers are getting into stacks for

1261
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:44,220
this to like to like sell the experience you know I felt
like I was playing against the stack I will say I did feel

1262
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:50,640
like I was playing against the stack because they were like
so coordinated but I could be wrong but they definitely this

1263
01:24:50,640 --> 01:25:00,800
was not their first game because they knew what the fuck
they were doing uh yeah yeah um but I saw a lot of streamers

1264
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,380
we're like oh we're gonna come in with a stack to play this
or they're definitely calming because they knew where the

1265
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:17,300
fuck I was all the time um and the game does feel very long
for it's not a there's not a fun solo queue experience i

1266
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:26,960
will say this the time to kill is so fast um it's so fast
that you know it's very hard for outplayability if you just

1267
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:33,760
run into people because there's not really a lot of places
to hide um i don't feel i don't think there's like a lot of

1268
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:40,780
places to hide to like you know in apex there's like you can
like bounce around different areas if you're um if you're

1269
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:49,760
like um solo queue and stuff so it's easier to like uh
easier to like counter things but for this if you get run up

1270
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:50,780
you're just dead

1271
01:25:53,840 --> 01:26:02,700
so i think maybe the rave girl might be better because i can
just go invisible and stuff it's very open it is very open

1272
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:07,820
in general that's how i feel but i got scammed i got scammed
off of this guy.

1273
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,700
I was like, bro, his ult seems so insane.

1274
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:13,960
And then, in the end, it...

1275
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:19,120
That shit was a goddamn fucking lie, for sure.

1276
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,140
Like...

1277
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:24,800
He was a goddamn lie.

1278
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,800
I'm gonna try... I don't know, should I try Scarlet?

1279
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,720
Shift the destructive wall into sand.

1280
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,580
Temporary, making it passable.

1281
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,140
Throw up to six.

1282
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,000
Enter stealth mode and make yourself hidden.

1283
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:35,760
Maybe.

1284
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:37,120
Oh, to enemies that were...

1285
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:49,040
far away maybe it doesn't work on close range i think yeah
1k damage no 10 damage yeah it's 100 damage why would it not

1286
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:54,240
be a hundred why would they make it a thousand damage in
training mode just make it a hundred because we're in

1287
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:58,280
training mode we're trying to see how much the damage is

1288
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:07,820
like i don't understand prank me.

1289
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,820
Oh, that was the most funniest prank ever, guys.

1290
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,100
All right, we'll try it.

1291
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:13,960
We'll try it, Uma.

1292
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:20,960
I actually don't know what... I don't... I'm gonna get...
I'm gonna try getting a shotgun and the R9.

1293
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,780
I think... I think the... Where was it?

1294
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,200
I had the Vanguard.

1295
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,120
The Vanguard was fine, I think.

1296
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:35,780
But I think I was getting kills with the Vanguard, but,
uh... Yeah, I was like, why the fuck... It made me feel like

1297
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:36,500
I was invincible.

1298
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:41,200
Baby, I was like, get pranked, nerd.

1299
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:45,820
I thought I was goddamn invincible, but apparently I was
not.

1300
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:49,880
I couldn't, yeah, I want the bear.

1301
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,160
I was definitely not invincible.

1302
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,020
I thought I was gonna be a god.

1303
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,800
I thought I was gonna hulk out.

1304
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:06,670
I don't like that.

1305
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:08,730
It's very pre-made.

1306
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,830
That's one of my other critiques.

1307
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:21,820
i can see it being fun but i definitely need friends to play
this game with to be really fun like but then like that's

1308
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:28,380
not like you know a lot of people like playing these types
of games solo too so it's like i'm trying to give you i

1309
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:39,200
guess i'm trying to give you guys a more like solo queue
experience um not in club players i just cute i don't keep

1310
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:44,360
oh my god bro what do you You made not enough players!

1311
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,360
This game just came out!

1312
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:53,910
Yeah, I'm giving you guys the true solo queue experience.

1313
01:28:54,290 --> 01:29:01,350
Like, maybe if you know this game more, the solo queue
experience would be better, but I'm still learning this.

1314
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,470
Yeah.

1315
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:06,170
I don't, like, I think it's just...

1316
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:09,230
I definitely pre-mades just seem more insane.

1317
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,320
Yeah, people are stuck in queue.

1318
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:16,520
What do you mean?

1319
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,440
Not enough.

1320
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:21,060
Okay, I'm going to try shotgun and another LMG.

1321
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,240
Alright, let's get it in.

1322
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,640
Thank you, Patrice.

1323
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:26,680
Thank you, the super chat.

1324
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:27,520
Thank you, thank you.

1325
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,000
Also, they did pick Monday as the release date.

1326
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,040
That's such a weird day to pick.

1327
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,780
Jordan's school day, too.

1328
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,220
No!

1329
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,020
I'm fucking trying Scarlet, I guess.

1330
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,200
I mean, Scarlet or...

1331
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:57,640
yeah i'm gonna do it i'm gonna dps i wanted to play umma i
don't know guys pick whatever i don't think it matters where

1332
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:05,120
the like i guess it does because like oh my god look to see
rainbow six siege the breach stuff yeah we hate monday what

1333
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,940
does pre-made means it means like you already have a set
squad so it's not like a solo queue experience where you

1334
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:15,800
just go in and like have like players who are solo queue
especially since this is not rank it's quick play so the the

1335
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:24,720
the of skill rise of players in a quick play match is all
over the place so that's also another thing to be aware of

1336
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:30,960
because you're like everybody is like different skill level
all right i tried to that vanguard right what's the dynasty

1337
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:38,600
like you must have excellent smithson you learned yeah leads
balance beauty precision and strength if he leaves three

1338
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:44,940
quick plays wait oh i didn't know that you've got some
pretty good knife i think like that's another honest you

1339
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:54,060
made art and life reinforced everything i just throw mine
hope i hit someone not the streamers though a lot of

1340
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:59,720
streamers are going in with pre-made and they're terrorizing
the lobbies from what i've heard a lot of the streamers that

1341
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:08,920
got invited to the high guard event are come going in with
pre-made because they knew they fucking knew they're like

1342
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:11,060
because Because they had the early access.

1343
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,200
10 seconds to go.

1344
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:14,820
So they're terrorizing the lobbies right now.

1345
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:18,520
Because there's no SPMM because everybody is literally
learning the game.

1346
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,040
The shield breaker is forming soon.

1347
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:25,080
Alright.

1348
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,420
Gather anything you need.

1349
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,960
They fucking knew.

1350
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,220
They knew this would be more fun with premades.

1351
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:36,180
Oh, what the fuck?

1352
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:39,500
I'm so bad at this.

1353
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:42,860
Oh,

1354
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,780
where are the loot's here?

1355
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:54,380
And I believe they'll know where the fucking loot spawns
too, because I don't know where the fuck the loot spawns.

1356
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,380
That's also another thing.

1357
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,320
Like, where the fuck are the chests?

1358
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,480
Where are the chests?

1359
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,320
Where are the chests?

1360
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,080
Bear time.

1361
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:10,760
Alright.

1362
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,220
There we go.

1363
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:15,100
Yoink mine.

1364
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:18,560
I don't know if we shared gems.

1365
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,340
Where the fuck are the chests?

1366
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,380
No, wait, actually.

1367
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,820
Or is it just all gems?

1368
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,380
Is this just a gem map?

1369
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:34,100
There's no fucking...

1370
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,540
God damn, I hate this mechanic.

1371
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,300
I actually hate this mechanic.

1372
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,060
Oh my god.

1373
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:49,500
Okay, I think, like, obviously, when I get better at it, it
would be a lot easier for me.

1374
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:52,440
But right now, I'm like, God, God, God, damn it.

1375
01:32:53,080 --> 01:33:00,820
Like, obviously, it would become muscle memory when I'd
fucking do it more.

1376
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:07,300
But, like, right now, when I'm learning it, it's, like,
frustrating when I miss the thing.

1377
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:09,140
Because I'm not used to doing these.

1378
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:18,440
the more you play it'll become become muscle memory but
right now i'm not used to it right now so i i'm not a fan

1379
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:23,760
but obviously obviously if i'm like

1380
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:29,620

01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:49,060

All right.

1397
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:23,790
Final time, team.

1398
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:24,990
Who asked the story?

1399
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:29,350
Breach, breach, breach!

1400
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:31,330
Breach!

1401
01:36:32,010 --> 01:36:33,090
They shot the bear!

1402
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:35,450
Everyone get ready to raid.

1403
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:37,030
Seach tower rolling in.

1404
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:39,070
All right, breach, breach!

1405
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,580
Calling Wakanda!

1406
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:49,980
Charla is here.

1407
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:51,940
All right.

1408
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:52,800
We're breaching.

1409
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:53,480
We're breaching.

1410
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,500
Yeah, no, I wish this was 3v3v3.

1411
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,840
I think it's like more like Bedwars, you know?

1412
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,900
It'll be more chaotic, like choosing the team you want to...

1413
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,620
I guess it's like, it's like more unfair, I guess, people
will feel that.

1414
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:09,180
March the movement.

1415
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,200
Watch this.

1416
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:12,360
Oh my god.

1417
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,480
Never mind.

1418
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:17,860
What the fuck.

1419
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,660
Are you fucking kidding me?

1420
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:25,440
All right, there you go.

1421
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,500
Oh, shit.

1422
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,220
There we go.

1423
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,230
I have my knives.

1424
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:47,780
No!

1425
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,520
I want...

1426
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,800
Okay, I don't like...

1427
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,080
Okay, this is much more...

1428
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:57,860
I don't play jet.

1429
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:58,300
guys.

1430
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,440
I wanted to see if I could kill them with it.

1431
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,700
I definitely don't play shit.

1432
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,120
I've never played Valorant.

1433
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:05,680
Do it.

1434
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:06,340
I'm gonna grab.

1435
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:13,040
I feel like my thing is like super definitely feels super
fucking.

1436
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:14,680
Okay.

1437
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:15,640
Where is he?

1438
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:18,700
I'm breaching.

1439
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:21,320
What the?

1440
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:24,380
There you go.

1441
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:26,160
Holy shit.

1442
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:27,780
Alright.

1443
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:30,160
We purged it?

1444
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:32,620
Nice.

1445
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:38,520
Okay, I fucking, I was still low.

1446
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:39,540
I- Yeah!

1447
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:40,120
Nade!

1448
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:45,120
Okay, that was a sick-ass Nade.

1449
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,120
Nice.

1450
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,660
That Nade was sick, though.

1451
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:57,540
I'm gonna use my shotgun.

1452
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,980
Swapping weapons is hard, though.

1453
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:04,900
Okay.

1454
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:08,160
Hello?

1455
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:13,740
I need to like figure out my sense.

1456
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:16,920
I feel like it's all over the place in general.

1457
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,220
I have no idea what my sense is.

1458
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:25,500
All right.

1459
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:26,280
Bum for charge.

1460
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:26,800
Bum for charge.

1461
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:28,240
Bum planted.

1462
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:29,020
This is it.

1463
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:30,100
Defend it and we're out.

1464
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:32,920
All right.

1465
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:38,790
Oh my god, I'm reloading.

1466
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:42,600
Oh my god.

1467
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:59,540
There you go Where oh he's through that enemies are near our
jack-o-de-seed That's not good Oh my god, he smoked.

1468
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,180
Oh my god.

1469
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:05,010
We lost our tower be careful out there

1470
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:22,520
Yeah Fantastic job team see it's funny when your team knows
what the fuck they're doing he couldn't stop running okay

1471
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:33,300
that one was fun i think the time to kill is fast though the
time to kill is definitely it's fun when you win it's fun

1472
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:41,600
but i'm still like it's still i'm still figuring things out
i'm definitely i'm still trying to figure shit out it's like

1473
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:50,680
very complicated yeah that's what i'm saying it it seems
really fun in the pre-made especially if you're calming and

1474
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:59,320
everything if you're calming your tactics and everything
also i knew it i knew umma is like fucking op this guy is so

1475
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:08,140
op you can like plant like you're literally planting turrets
like you're planting turrets and you have like a giant like

1476
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:12,380
iron golem blocking the main entrance Like, that shit seems
broken.

1477
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:16,020
Yeah, what's her name?

1478
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:16,340
Una?

1479
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,180
Una.

1480
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:19,160
I need to figure out my sense.

1481
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:22,920
I don't know if it's, like, too high or too low.

1482
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:25,880
I don't like there's no, like, uh, right.

1483
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:30,000
I can't tell if it's too high or too low right now.

1484
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:34,620
I'll keep it for, maybe I'll lower it for now.

1485
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:38,580
Is it overwhelmingly negative?

1486
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:46,840
Because, like, I think like three I think it's because like
it's not a solo queue experience I can tell why it's

1487
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:53,320
negative just because it's not a solo queue experience it's
only for like because like if you look at other apex you can

1488
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:59,380
solo queue it because there's like a lot of movement tech
you can do because it's like if it's like siege if it's like

1489
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:08,140
siege then it's more fun when you're like in a team or if
you're stacking it and stuff oh it's kicking people out and

1490
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:08,860
time to get into

1491
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:14,920
yeah people are still queuing so it's expected

1492
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:32,180
but like i wouldn't say it's like bad i wouldn't say this is
a bad game i think if it's maybe if it's like 3v3v3 maybe

1493
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:35,900
it'd be better but like

1494
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:47,200
3v3 seems too compact for such a big ass map it felt like i
was Like, in the trailer, it felt like I was going to play

1495
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,380
with, like, more people.

1496
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,060
The footsteps are...

1497
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,380
It's very esporty.

1498
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:56,440
I will say this can have an esport game.

1499
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:59,180
It can get, like, intense esport-wise.

1500
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,200
Because Rainbow Six Siege.

1501
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,820
Even though, like, the casuals don't play.

1502
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,020
It's not a casual game, I think.

1503
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,580
This is not casual-coded.

1504
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,440
I think that's the main biggest problem.

1505
01:43:12,290 --> 01:43:14,830
This game is not casual-coded for people.

1506
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:16,530
I am a keeper of trees.

1507
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:17,370
I think.

1508
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:18,610
Yeah.

1509
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:21,210
It doesn't feel casual for casuals.

1510
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:25,770
It feels like it's more so like for the hardcore gamers.

1511
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:27,430
Like the competitive gamers.

1512
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:29,650
The rank for this might thrive.

1513
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:30,710
I think.

1514
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:40,250
I think rank wise this game can thrive and it's more like
more for more competitive stuff but not for the casuals.

1515
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:44,590
No I just tabbed out that's why I was tabbing out.

1516
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:58,760
and then i can tell this will get really frustrating like
siege with like the court like the stuff that the corners

1517
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:03,040
you do and stuff like that oh he doesn't know he doesn't
know the oldest dog

1518
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:17,200
i think the quick play because like i think i think what oh
my god this guy already knows the meta i think like there's

1519
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:24,080
gonna be a lot of like thinking going on regarding like uh
oh this be fucking frustrating.

1520
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:24,900
I am out.

1521
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,640
Like, where the fuck do I reinforce in general?

1522
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:36,200
I don't know if I like I don't know, Dynasty or... I'm gonna
try the Viper now.

1523
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:40,860
I'm gonna try... I guess Viper Vanguard?

1524
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,180
Because I can use Viper for close range.

1525
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:51,730
I feel like the moment people figure out the meta, this is
gonna be a very frustrating game for people.

1526
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:53,970
Like, for, like, non-casuals.

1527
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:59,910
Because, like, Rainbow Six Siege has a really bad entry
point into the game.

1528
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:04,690
Because, like, because it's just so hard to...

1529
01:45:04,690 --> 01:45:11,430
It's not welcoming to new players in general, I feel, for
Rainbow Six Siege.

1530
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:17,070
And I think this game could be similar in the future.

1531
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:21,610
When people, like, figure out the meta and stuff.

1532
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:35,960
because I don't know if I can see casual players playing
this for long term because like with the stuff you have to

1533
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:45,560
learn too I think I think with this yeah all the stuff you
have to learn for this game and like the corners like the

1534
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:55,060
corners and gunplay and everything is going to be very
frustrating I can tell yeah I think it's a it's definitely a

1535
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:58,380
sweaty game want to try.

1536
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:00,980
I fucking hate I don't have the muscle memory yet.

1537
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:01,900
Alright.

1538
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:06,360
I would definitely want to try this game out as a pre-made.

1539
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:08,900
For sure.

1540
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:16,380
Oh my god.

1541
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,420
I'm God of warring.

1542
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,620
I wonder if this is like good loot in here.

1543
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:24,500
I think.

1544
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:24,860
Yeah?

1545
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:25,940
Yeah I knew it.

1546
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:27,680
Okay.

1547
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:29,240
Yeah like shit like this.

1548
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:29,700
You know?

1549
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:31,400
Uh...

1550
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:42,580
like shit like this like oh i have to make sure i i i go
here for like extra loot and stuff like that and then we

1551
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:52,700
have to start camping near the shield breaker to grab for
and i have to mine this so if i need more armor if i'm

1552
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:57,900
getting breached i can i can have loot ready in time

1553
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:09,390
like every i will say everyone is learning the game right
now so yeah i have to have this so if i die at least i would

1554
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:14,790
have emergency armor god fucking so bad at this

1555
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:23,030
oh was that a person brought me something useful i see oh
hey nice

1556
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:39,030
someone over there but i might be delusional maybe he'll

1557
01:47:42,130 --> 01:47:49,950
are you fucking kidding me oh my god bro

1558
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:54,520
that guy did not know

1559
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:03,450
okay these guys can aim these guys can aim that's bad

1560
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:14,890
oh my god these guys are aimers though i swear to god this
is a pre-made i I swear to fucking God.

1561
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:24,190
I swear to fucking God if this is a pre-made.

1562
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:29,970
This better be just someone really good at aiming.

1563
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,770
Okay, they're going this way.

1564
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:37,530
I'm gonna head over to our buddy here.

1565
01:48:38,830 --> 01:48:41,310
Our guy's gonna like get fucking ganked on soon.

1566
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:43,030
Yeah, I fucking do it.

1567
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:46,230
shot at right now.

1568
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:56,090
Lead up for that.

1569
01:48:56,410 --> 01:48:56,910
Not bad.

1570
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:05,580
Yeah, see, this is the thing I don't like here.

1571
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:08,500
It's just literally we're just trying to camp each other.

1572
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:18,950
Yeah, I don't know if I'm a fan of that in general.

1573
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:25,450
It's just like literally we're just camping the storm
breaker out type deal.

1574
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:28,130
It seems very frustrating.

1575
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:28,930
Time to pick up.

1576
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:31,270
Move in.

1577
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:32,590
This is our shot.

1578
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:35,650
Alright.

1579
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,530
We're getting into the overtime stretch.

1580
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:44,270
Yeah, that's how you're supposed to play it, but it's
like...

1581
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:50,110
That's why I'm like, personally, I'm not a huge fan of
Rainmaker mode.

1582
01:49:51,950 --> 01:49:56,170
I actually really hate Rainmaker mode in Splatoon.

1583
01:50:00,590 --> 01:50:01,290
Mounting up.

1584
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:02,030
Let's move.

1585
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:06,650
The movement is...

1586
01:50:06,650 --> 01:50:06,990
Alright.

1587
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:10,890
Rise and fight, we sprout.

1588
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:13,390
Oh, maybe not this...

1589
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:14,330
Definitely not this gun.

1590
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,170
I'll try... I'm still figuring out the...

1591
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:21,810
Yeah, not this gun.

1592
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:24,050
I got... I think... What was the other one?

1593
01:50:25,970 --> 01:50:27,090
Jesus Christ!

1594
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:28,970
I gotta wait.

1595
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:33,710
I had a regen.

1596
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:39,460
Remaker is just frustrating.

1597
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:46,350
I want to know what the meta guns are.

1598
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:55,630
There you go.

1599
01:50:56,810 --> 01:50:56,810
There

1600
01:51:04,130 --> 01:51:09,350
you go.

1601
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:14,590
Oh, I want to know what the gun meta is though.

1602
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:18,170
Grab this just in case.

1603
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:20,350
Breaching, breaching, breaching!

1604
01:51:21,410 --> 01:51:21,890
Breaching!

1605
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:25,290
I see you!

1606
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:26,990
I see...

1607
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:27,750
I'm broke.

1608
01:51:27,970 --> 01:51:28,690
Oh, they don't know!

1609
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:29,710
They don't know!

1610
01:51:29,870 --> 01:51:30,850
Oh, they don't know you can't see this.

1611
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:31,690
Okay, same here.

1612
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:34,010
I was just like you, and I didn't know.

1613
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:36,450
I didn't know you can't shoot anything.

1614
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:38,630
Don't worry, I was just like you.

1615
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:39,690
But I couldn't...

1616
01:51:39,690 --> 01:51:41,910
I didn't realize I couldn't shoot through the shield.

1617
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:44,430
I'm just like you.

1618
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:45,070
Don't worry.

1619
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:53,290
I was just like you

1620
01:52:25,650 --> 01:52:35,410
Fuck that I'm wasted I know I wasted that but like I
couldn't be bothered I really didn't want to fucking deal

1621
01:52:35,410 --> 01:52:46,110
with these people Oh my god that's so strong Holy shit wait
that is so strong

1622
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:53,050
Oh my god we are not as insane

1623
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:01,810
Oh my god wait Arnon

1624
01:53:05,730 --> 01:53:07,170
Holy fuck!

1625
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:16,280
Okay, I hope somebody is breaching this.

1626
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:20,260
Guys, I swear to God, I did so much already.

1627
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:38,050
But then...

1628
01:53:38,050 --> 01:53:38,870
No, no!

1629
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:42,750
That's unlucky.

1630
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:47,010
Oh my god, no.

1631
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:48,590
That shit was crazy.

1632
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:51,270
Holy fuck.

1633
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:53,690
Okay, this was the main bomb.

1634
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:55,190
Okay, that's what I needed to know.

1635
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:56,910
I was like, which was the main bomb?

1636
01:53:57,050 --> 01:53:59,170
I was like, oh my god, I got to buy.

1637
01:53:59,450 --> 01:54:00,170
I forgot to buy.

1638
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:03,150
Okay, I know I like...

01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:12,110
That shit's broken, I feel.

1660
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:15,130
Anybody here at the airdrop?

1661
01:56:17,950 --> 01:56:18,930
They're literally all there.

1662
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:22,090
Why is my team not the airdrop?

1663
01:56:22,190 --> 01:56:22,990
I hate my team.

1664
01:56:23,110 --> 01:56:25,290
I hate my team

1665
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:29,870
They're they're tired.

01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:33,700
They're all there already and then my team was like la-deed
up

1667
01:56:38,870 --> 01:56:44,450
Like a fucking course I already hate my team.

1668
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:50,090
I think I hate them a lot only because I literally 1v3'd and
like I was like where are they?

1669
01:56:53,110 --> 01:56:56,510
Which is fine Where's my team?

It's go time group.

1678
01:57:40,730 --> 01:57:42,190
The enemy picks up the shield breaker.

1679
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:43,250
Intercept them.

1680
01:57:43,390 --> 01:57:49,310
Like they're already all convened there and then my team was
like, it's a miracle that we live this far.

1681
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:54,210
There they are.

1682
01:57:56,110 --> 01:57:57,410
Enemy is approaching our base.

1683
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:58,630
They've got the shield breaker.

1684
01:58:01,290 --> 01:58:03,310
Now I'm off the bear though.

1685
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:03,790
Reloading.

1686
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:06,110
Mounting up, let's move.

1687
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:09,630
I don't...

1688
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:12,530
They're on the other side.

1689
01:58:12,670 --> 01:58:13,430
We have to go this side.

1690
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:16,590
They're gonna breach it.

1691
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:17,350
It doesn't matter.

1692
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:20,610
Yeah, they're gonna breach it.

1693
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:25,690
How did my team die?

1694
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:26,310
What?

1695
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:27,790
Two people are he...

1696
01:58:27,790 --> 01:58:28,470
Oh my god.

1697
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:29,210
Oh my god.

1698
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:30,130
Oh my god.

1699
01:58:30,830 --> 01:58:31,450
Oh no.

1700
01:58:31,450 --> 01:58:33,110
No, this is not a solo queue.

1701
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:34,650
Not a solo queue experience.

1702
01:58:34,990 --> 01:58:35,990
Oh my god.

1703
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:37,450

1705
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:44,010
I'm not solo cute.

1706
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:45,290
Not solo cute.

1707
01:58:46,810 --> 01:58:47,830
Not it.

1708
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:49,690
Solo cute ain't it.

1709
01:58:50,190 --> 01:58:53,330
My team is actually goddamn stupid.

1710
01:58:58,010 --> 01:59:00,750
It killed my fucking mother of trees.

1711
01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:04,490
Why are you standing there?

1712
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:06,310
Oh my god.

1713
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:11,410

Oh...

1719
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:36,660
I have to get out of that.

1720
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,280
Oh my god, this sucks!

1721
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:45,190

1722
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:46,910

Like the ammo is so low though, that's the only issue.

1735
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:46,720
The ammo is so low for this.

1736
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:47,700
Like yeah, you're welcome.

1737
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:56,180

upgraded because like the mag is so goddamn shit.

1738
02:01:58,020 --> 02:01:59,640
The mag is actually so bad.

1739
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,020
I didn't reload the other gun.

1740
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:09,780

1751
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:47,800
I replaced the wrong gun.

1752
02:02:48,100 --> 02:02:49,480
Whoops, I have double vipers now.

1753
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:51,320

know what he does i realized something about i realized

1791
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:18,020
something about the support um They like, they like, they
just give themselves over heal and then go straight in.

1792
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:20,240
Like, that's what I realized.

1793
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:23,380
They literally give themselves over heal and then just go
in.

1794
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:24,880
That's so smart, actually.

1795
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,460
That's actually incredibly smart.

1796
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:28,140
Guys, we have to.

1797
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:31,620
Yeah, they do self-shield.

1798
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:36,120
I think the support is actually one of the strongest, I
think, because of that.

1799
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:38,400
Summoning a whisk.

1800
02:07:42,310 --> 02:07:49,590

1806
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:27,100
It's okay.

1807
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:28,120
It's okay.

1808
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:29,800
I will never see them again.

1809
02:08:30,020 --> 02:08:30,780
That's fine.

1810
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,180
I'm fine with that.

1811
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:34,380
Oh my god.

1812
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,480
My connection for Haggad has lost.

1813
02:08:40,980 --> 02:08:41,620
Oh my god.

1814
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:43,940
Yo, can I get a team with nothing?

1815
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:49,200
Oh my god.

1816
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:51,360
Oh my god.

1817
02:08:51,380 --> 02:09:04,020
back to waiting in queue waiting in my login queue let me
see let me see if i can let me see if i can crap let me mess

1818
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:15,640
let's see who's like solo queue right now who's going
through solo queue hell like me uh all right i tabbed out

1819
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:32,980
i'm checking to see if anyone is anyone is fucking going
through you hell right now i'm oh my god oh my god

1820
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:49,140
i'm just i just oh man i my god i'm just i hate my teammates
so much i hate my teammates and so

1821
02:09:56,080 --> 02:10:05,000
it's it's not solo q coded it feels like it's especially
like you know in other games you can possibly 1b3 if you

1822
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:13,980
have the aim but like the time to kill is like relatively
fast to the point where it's like pretty difficult to like i

1823
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:19,060
did 1b3 but because i also had a box though I had a box to
play around.

1824
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:22,840
But when you're in the open, you tend to not have a fucking
box.

1825
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:31,380
Oh my god.

1826
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:32,100
Alright.

1827
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:33,640
Ha.

1828
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:37,320
Alright.

1829
02:10:37,540 --> 02:10:39,320
I feel like Mimi...

1830
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:40,220
Okay, I'm gonna try her.

1831
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:42,560
The guy that played her was crazy.

1832
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,660
Was crazy.

1833
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:47,060
The overshield is insane.

1834
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:48,820
like for extra HP.

1835
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:50,880
So I feel like she might be really...

1836
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,900
She might be actually the one for solo Q.

1837
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:56,160
No, yeah, no.

1838
02:10:56,620 --> 02:10:59,620
Like, dealing with my randoms was just...

1839
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:05,320
The overshield definitely looks very strong.

1840
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:06,380
We're going to try that.

1841
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:12,140
I'm going to check if there's a sense converter now.

1842
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:14,380
Sense converter.

1843
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:16,040
Hi, guard.

1844
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:29,340
um have they made a high guard sense converter yet hi oh
they did thank the lord okay they actually did i've been

They don't have a re-queue system type deal.

1885

Like, if someone drops out, they don't have, like, someone
filling in instantly.

Thank you, thank you.

1942
02:19:13,950 --> 02:19:17,510
Maybe it's because the same five people are queuing up at
the same time.

1943
02:19:17,810 --> 02:19:19,190
I've waited a little bit now.

1944

So maybe this time, this time, that will get a six out of
six.

This time.

1946
02:19:30,910 --> 02:19:34,910

1951
02:19:41,890 --> 02:19:45,230

02:19:45,250 --> 02:19:45,810

1953
02:19:46,230 --> 02:19:46,850

Oh.

1959
02:20:01,090 --> 02:20:02,710
It was truly the hardest.

1960
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:07,050
This has to be the hardest game of my life because I
couldn't get in a fucking game.

1961
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:08,350
I broke the cycle.

1962
02:20:08,970 --> 02:20:10,590
I fucking broke the cycle.

1963
02:20:14,050 --> 02:20:15,130
We did it.

1964
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:17,330
We pulled through.

1965
02:20:19,750 --> 02:20:21,410
Holy shit, a fourth game.

1966
02:20:25,490 --> 02:20:25,770

1967
02:20:27,050 --> 02:20:28,750
We got our fourth game.

02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:33,710
All right, Viper.

1969
02:20:35,350 --> 02:20:38,410
I don't know if I like Vanguard or Dynasty more.

1970
02:20:38,630 --> 02:20:41,330
Which one did you guys think was felt better?

1971
02:20:42,450 --> 02:20:43,850
I couldn't tell, honestly.

1972
02:20:46,610 --> 02:20:48,790
I personally couldn't tell what was better.

1973
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:51,030
No, the matches feel too long.

1974
02:20:51,290 --> 02:20:52,030
Especially if you're losing.

1975
02:20:52,350 --> 02:20:53,670
I wanted to just, like, surrender.

1976
02:20:57,130 --> 02:20:58,410
Fantasy is better.

1977
02:20:59,910 --> 02:21:00,630
Alright, we'll try.

1978
02:21:00,850 --> 02:21:03,650

2077
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:28,660

I can see people using that, actually.

2081
02:29:40,770 --> 02:29:41,770
It's an incoming airdrop.

2082
02:29:41,890 --> 02:29:43,410
How are you supposed to fucking know where that shit's at?

2083
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:45,030

It's literally in on the map.

2088
02:29:57,090 --> 02:29:59,730

I have for a five minute game.

2192
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:27,240
Okay.

2193
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:33,780
Yeah, having a team that comes is pretty nice.

2194
02:36:35,340 --> 02:36:35,860
Divino.

2195
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,280
All right, he's coming with me.

2196
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:39,280
He's like, you're coming with me.

2197
02:36:42,860 --> 02:36:44,040
I knew what he was doing.

2198
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:44,580
He calmed.

2199
02:36:44,700 --> 02:36:45,380
I like that.

2200
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:49,220
Deep.

2201
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:50,200
It's fun.

2202
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:53,500
It's fun when I have someone that talks.

2203
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:58,620
It's just sometimes you don't get those people.

2204
02:36:58,760 --> 02:36:59,620
It's this guy, right?

2205
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:01,980

It's always a pre-made buff.

2222
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:00,520
What a nerd having friends.

2223
02:38:01,720 --> 02:38:02,280
Having free.

2224
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:05,720
Bro, I would tell Gully to kick Sturport and then invite me.

2225
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:11,160
And I knew it.

2226
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:12,300
I know I'm the only one.

2227
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:13,660
I told you guys.

2228
02:38:13,740 --> 02:38:24,880
All the streamers that, like, had, like, the They got the
invite new They fucking knew They knew like It's just better

2229
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:31,360
in the pre-made I didn't know I was playing solo I didn't
know I came in here With zero knowledge

2230
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:49,300
I came here I didn't know Yeah pre-made is those who already
came in there with two friends going in because they knew it

2231
02:38:49,300 --> 02:38:51,100
was much much better experience

2232
02:38:58,420 --> 02:39:06,440
i did it was very too late i got warned the day i did still
they i did but the thing is i got told a date right

2233
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:13,540
literally like the yesterday so there was no time to make a
pre-made reinforce the base and armor there was no time to

2234
02:39:13,540 --> 02:39:17,380
make pre-mades it was Run it, re-rip it.

2235
02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:19,520
We do it live.

2236
02:39:20,240 --> 02:39:21,800
Like, I don't know what to reinforce.

2237
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:23,380
Like, what the fuck do you...

2238
02:39:23,380 --> 02:39:25,280
Oh, I reinforced the wrong thing.

2239
02:39:25,380 --> 02:39:26,280
This has no bomb.

2240
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:27,100
Whoops.

2241
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:32,340
If you like siege, I guess.

2242
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:35,000
I guess if you like siege, you'll like this game.

2243
02:39:35,820 --> 02:39:37,800
Because it's very siege-y.

2244
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:39,360
The gunplay is less...

2245
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:43,160
The gunplay is, like, apex type deal, sort of.

2246
02:39:43,420 --> 02:39:45,860
But, like, it's still, like...

2247
02:39:46,300 --> 02:39:46,840
That's it.

2248
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:48,360
Reinforcing a wall.

2249
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:53,520
The time to kill is also quite low.

2250
02:39:57,670 --> 02:39:57,690
Yeah.

2251
02:39:57,990 --> 02:39:58,690
Dome's opening in 10.

2252
02:39:59,010 --> 02:39:59,630
Ready up team.

2253
02:40:02,210 --> 02:40:04,050
I think I found my load up though.

2254
02:40:04,170 --> 02:40:05,170
I like this load up.

2255
02:40:08,190 --> 02:40:09,810
I like my current load up.

2256
02:40:10,690 --> 02:40:14,890
And then I have to know the loot paths, but I don't know the
loot paths too.

2257
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:17,870
Like if you know the, like you have to play like.

2258
02:40:18,050 --> 02:40:25,910
It's like people be like, I want to play Dust 2 only because
that's the good best best loot path for some shit Because

2259
02:40:25,910 --> 02:40:28,550
like I haven't played this map before where the fuck is the
loot?

2260
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:31,990
Where is the loot?

2261
02:40:36,130 --> 02:40:38,230
I'll make my own loot.

2262
02:40:38,550 --> 02:40:44,970
Fuck this I don't care Yeah

2263
02:40:52,430 --> 02:41:06,350
grab it I need armor though really bad okay all right it
really is and it's like it's like quick play too so like you

2264
02:41:06,350 --> 02:41:15,230
get people from different types different um skill level so
you can't guarantee that your team will be okay like you

2265
02:41:15,230 --> 02:41:24,590
know you know because like you know literally I played four
matches And, like, my teams have been all over the place.

2266
02:41:24,750 --> 02:41:26,510
I haven't had a close game yet.

2267
02:41:28,110 --> 02:41:29,590
I've yet to have a close game.

2268
02:41:29,890 --> 02:41:33,950
It's literally, like, if your teammates are, like, not
fucking stupid.

2269
02:41:36,590 --> 02:41:37,190
Like...

2270
02:41:37,970 --> 02:41:40,390
Yeah, no guarantees there.

2271
02:41:40,870 --> 02:41:41,490
It's more...

2272
02:41:41,490 --> 02:41:43,170
It's, like, literally, teammate RNG.

2273
02:41:43,470 --> 02:41:45,330
Is your teammate special or not?

2274
02:41:50,410 --> 02:41:52,670
The ammo is so low.

2275
02:41:52,790 --> 02:41:57,650
I will say ammo is so fucking low.

2276
02:42:00,290 --> 02:42:02,810
For this type deal.

2277
02:42:08,530 --> 02:42:09,430
Oh, people are here.

2278
02:42:10,950 --> 02:42:12,090
People are on me.

2279
02:42:12,350 --> 02:42:12,930
People are on me.

2280
02:42:16,030 --> 02:42:16,930
People are already on me.

2281
02:42:18,910 --> 02:42:19,910
We have to go.

2282
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:22,850
Foes spotted.

2283
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:33,260
Foes spotted.

2284
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:35,540

02:45:57,090 --> 02:45:57,550
Defensive.

02:51:14,710 --> 02:51:15,310
It stayed.

2409
02:51:15,550 --> 02:51:16,750
I threw this a lot.

2410
02:51:19,270 --> 02:51:20,130
I was going to sit.

2411
02:51:20,310 --> 02:51:22,490
I'm pretty sure I got that a while ago.

2412
02:51:23,650 --> 02:51:23,930
I don't know.

2413
02:51:24,030 --> 02:51:25,230
The shield break is ready for me.

2414
02:51:25,390 --> 02:51:26,090
And we're not there.

2415
02:51:26,730 --> 02:51:27,590
Shield break is ready.

2416
02:51:27,610 --> 02:51:28,630
We're not even there.

2417
02:51:40,180 --> 02:51:41,360
This is bad.

2418
02:51:41,540 --> 02:51:42,260
This is a bad gun.

2419
02:51:43,600 --> 02:51:45,420
This is not close range.

2420
02:51:46,060 --> 02:51:47,300
Which is really bad for us.

2421
02:51:49,020 --> 02:51:49,040
What?

2422
02:51:50,420 --> 02:51:52,180
Oh, I didn't see him.

2423
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:54,860
Nah, that gun sucked.

2424
02:51:55,860 --> 02:51:56,820
That was my bad.

2425
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:58,400
I didn't know what that gun...

2426
02:51:58,400 --> 02:52:00,380
I didn't know if it was long range or not.

2427
02:52:01,560 --> 02:52:02,180
Well, now I do.

2428
02:52:12,860 --> 02:52:24,180

2431
02:52:45,390 --> 02:52:46,030

2432
02:52:48,630 --> 02:52:49,910

2433
02:52:58,450 --> 02:52:59,090
Reloading!

2434
02:52:59,430 --> 02:53:00,510
We've got another dome breach.

2435
02:53:00,830 --> 02:53:01,710
Seal it!

2436
02:53:02,490 --> 02:53:02,970

So long, here.

2439
02:53:07,830 --> 02:53:08,450
Protect yourself.

2440
02:53:09,230 --> 02:53:10,610
It will all be overseen.

2441
02:53:10,930 --> 02:53:11,230
Alright.

2442
02:53:13,310 --> 02:53:14,310
Shifted this wall.

02:53:14,490 --> 02:53:15,350
Slide through?

2444
02:53:15,450 --> 02:53:18,210
Where the fuck are they?

2445
02:53:21,650 --> 02:53:23,090
We've got baddies nearby.

2446
02:53:26,130 --> 02:53:27,730
I hear him.

2447
02:53:29,470 --> 02:53:29,930
Heads up.

2448
02:53:30,030 --> 02:53:31,010
They're planting a bomb.

2449
02:53:31,390 --> 02:53:31,710
Intercept.

2450
02:53:35,650 --> 02:53:36,650
There we go.

2451
02:53:42,130 --> 02:53:42,890
That's fine.

2452
02:53:43,030 --> 02:53:43,770
We defused it.

2453
02:53:45,270 --> 02:53:45,510
Alright.

2454
02:53:46,690 --> 02:53:47,750

2456
02:53:53,050 --> 02:53:54,330

What is that?

2462
02:54:40,950 --> 02:54:41,930
How do I remove this?

2463
02:54:42,110 --> 02:54:42,710
Okay, nice.

2464
02:54:43,950 --> 02:54:45,010
I was gonna say.

2465
02:54:46,470 --> 02:54:48,390
How the fuck do I remove that?

2466
02:54:49,850 --> 02:54:51,770
From all other side.

2467
02:54:52,190 --> 02:54:52,310
Oh!

2468
02:54:53,830 --> 02:54:56,390

It's just, like, confusing.

2473
02:55:02,910 --> 02:55:03,390
Sometimes.

2474
02:55:03,710 --> 02:55:04,510
No, it's been upgraded.

2475
02:55:04,930 --> 02:55:05,350

2476
02:55:05,650 --> 02:55:07,230
Oh yeah, I should see my loot upgrade.

2477
02:55:08,650 --> 02:55:09,650
I should double check that.

2478
02:55:12,970 --> 02:55:15,030
Where's my little trading post?

2479
02:55:15,370 --> 02:55:16,430

2480
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:19,950

Is that it?

2492
02:55:48,990 --> 02:55:51,650
Guys, if you were not on your bear, you'd fucking die, by
the way.

2493
02:55:53,090 --> 02:55:57,130
For those who don't know, if you were not on the bear, you
actually fucking just die.

2494
02:55:57,650 --> 02:56:00,490
There is fall damage if you're not on the goddamn bear.

2495
02:56:00,510 --> 02:56:01,670
There's no mobs on your map.

2496
02:56:07,030 --> 02:56:07,970
Looking for movement.

2497
02:56:10,090 --> 02:56:16,850
I Mean it's a shooter game most of these guns it's just like
a template on what the guns are supposed to be

2498
02:56:27,790 --> 02:56:30,630

2505
02:56:56,970 --> 02:56:57,590

I want to protect my teammates from here.

2510
02:57:07,410 --> 02:57:08,630
We're going to head from here.

2511
02:57:10,570 --> 02:57:12,230
Summoning a dark spawn.

2512
02:57:20,730 --> 02:57:21,850

2550
03:00:49,250 --> 03:00:50,240

And then I got sniped.

2553
03:00:53,930 --> 03:00:55,090

03:00:55,170 --> 03:00:58,030

2562
03:01:43,650 --> 03:01:45,670
screen but it was actually two

03:02:00,330 --> 03:02:01,330
Panicking right now.

2568
03:02:01,670 --> 03:02:03,270
Are you fucking kidding me?

2569
03:02:04,350 --> 03:02:06,490
I'm playing panic right now.

2570
03:02:07,050 --> 03:02:08,070
That sucks.

2571
03:02:08,490 --> 03:02:08,770
Oh!

2572
03:02:11,750 --> 03:02:15,790
I'm playing like... I'm playing like way too panicky.

2573
03:02:16,290 --> 03:02:17,730
I'm like too scared right now.

2574
03:02:18,730 --> 03:02:20,950
I respawned though.

2575
03:02:21,990 --> 03:02:22,850
I need to help my team.

2576
03:02:43,360 --> 03:02:44,400
There.

2577
03:02:54,010 --> 03:02:54,470
Alright.

2578
03:02:57,390 --> 03:02:59,670
Where is she?

2579
03:03:02,670 --> 03:03:04,050
Oh my god.

2580
03:03:04,650 --> 03:03:06,610
Someone shoot me.

2581
03:03:06,830 --> 03:03:08,630
Take this song off.

2582
03:03:08,790 --> 03:03:09,470
After reload.

2583
03:03:10,090 --> 03:03:10,190
Oh.

2584
03:03:12,730 --> 03:03:13,550
Death can wait.

2585
03:03:14,270 --> 03:03:15,430
I will not.

2586
03:03:19,330 --> 03:03:21,730
Yeah, there's so much stuff going on here.

2587
03:03:30,690 --> 03:03:31,530
It's on.

2588
03:03:32,090 --> 03:03:33,350
Their siege tower is done.

2589
03:03:33,890 --> 03:03:34,930
Now let's clear them out.

2590
03:03:35,810 --> 03:03:36,130
Heads up.

2591
03:03:36,330 --> 03:03:37,150
They're planting a bomb.

2592
03:03:37,530 --> 03:03:37,890
Intercept.

2593
03:03:38,710 --> 03:03:40,230
An enemy bomb is counting down.

2594
03:03:40,410 --> 03:03:41,970
We need to bind them.

2595
03:03:43,250 --> 03:03:44,970
My sky eyes looking for enemies.

2596
03:03:46,310 --> 03:03:47,550
The foe eliminated.

2597
03:03:48,570 --> 03:03:53,150
Let the darkness take you take this soul armor

2598
03:03:57,040 --> 03:04:07,340
We will meet again Oh my god Holy shit the lock in Oh my god

2599
03:04:10,760 --> 03:04:19,880
I like I like panicked there in the moment but that had to
lock in there Holy shit I was trying my best to like okay

2600
03:04:19,880 --> 03:04:32,820
focus focus I think what I don't like also is just the mag
is so small it's so small it's such a small mag oh okay

2601
03:04:36,160 --> 03:04:48,740
oh am I liking the game I think if I had a pre-made I would
like it more right now but I know this character this

2602
03:04:48,740 --> 03:05:00,040
character is so strong i think she she's the strong for me
personally she seems like the the strongest because she

2603
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:09,900
plays like uh she plays like reina with the shields and
stuff yeah she the overhelp is insane yeah i think out of

2604
03:05:09,900 --> 03:05:18,420
all the characters her her and the recon is actually so
strong every time i have a recon character we win but she's

2605
03:05:18,420 --> 03:05:29,740
very she's the solo carry pick yeah yeah she's her and the
recon are insane in general um this is really good during

2606
03:05:29,740 --> 03:05:36,120
when you're reaching because it's like chaotic and stuff i
thought it was shit but like in the game is he's actually

2607
03:05:36,120 --> 03:05:44,480
really strong i think these three are like the strongest
character these three Execute from range, too.

2608
03:05:44,580 --> 03:05:45,280
I'll do...

2609
03:05:45,280 --> 03:05:46,420
Wait, how long I've been playing for?

2610
03:05:48,120 --> 03:05:48,820
And you're in three hours.

2611
03:05:48,920 --> 03:05:50,300
I'll do one more game.

2612
03:05:50,420 --> 03:05:51,120
I'm so sad.

2613
03:05:51,540 --> 03:05:52,780
I got never added me.

2614
03:05:55,720 --> 03:05:59,320
I sent you a friend with wishpilies responda.

2615
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:03,340
You never responded.

2616
03:06:06,860 --> 03:06:08,640
No, you can't switch during game.

2617
03:06:08,760 --> 03:06:11,120
So you go in right off the bat.

2618
03:06:11,320 --> 03:06:12,580
Right off the bat.

2619
03:06:12,760 --> 03:06:13,180
I don't...

2620
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:19,360
Um, I don't know if I want to play Slade, only because,
like, her overshield is just so strong, and I like...

2621
03:06:19,360 --> 03:06:22,080
I really like that, the playstyle of her.

2622
03:06:27,360 --> 03:06:27,680
Yeah.

2623
03:06:29,460 --> 03:06:31,200
She seems... I'll do one more.

2624
03:06:31,780 --> 03:06:35,600
But, in my opinion, that is the strongest character.

2625
03:06:39,450 --> 03:06:41,150
Yes, she has the solo carry potential.

2626
03:06:41,690 --> 03:06:43,850
I literally, like, 1v3 with the overshield.

2627
03:06:44,430 --> 03:06:48,610
Like, I literally get killed, overshield, run, and then...

2628
03:06:48,630 --> 03:06:51,130
and a little bit of HP and then go back in.

2629
03:06:51,810 --> 03:06:53,210
It's so fucking OP.

2630
03:06:57,620 --> 03:06:58,400
There we go.

2631
03:06:58,620 --> 03:06:59,160
I got her.

2632
03:07:00,020 --> 03:07:00,540
I got her!

2633
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:11,000
Yeah, and it also denied revives, too.

2634
03:07:12,120 --> 03:07:12,460
Yeah.

2635
03:07:14,540 --> 03:07:16,100
Where's Lala gonna play?

2636
03:07:17,380 --> 03:07:18,340
Oh, alright.

2637
03:07:21,420 --> 03:07:25,340
I still am very confused with the with the breach stuff.

2638
03:07:29,420 --> 03:07:33,440
Yeah, I legit, yeah, I carried that whole game with Mara,
for sure, yeah.

2639
03:07:36,220 --> 03:07:40,680
It's, well, it's overwhelmingly negative because, like, it
was so hard to get into the game in general.

2640
03:07:40,880 --> 03:07:47,240
It's a, I only think it's, the reason why it's
overwhelmingly negative, too, is that it's multi, a lot of

2641
03:07:47,240 --> 03:07:49,580
multiplayer games are generally overwhelmingly negative.

2642
03:07:49,760 --> 03:07:50,420
Right, team.

2643
03:07:50,780 --> 03:07:51,960
Dome shields almost unlocked.

2644
03:07:51,980 --> 03:07:55,260
And also, because, like, it's complicated.

2645
03:07:57,760 --> 03:08:07,920
complicated it's very hard to figure out in general I'm like
every every game I'm learning more and more about what to do

2646
03:08:07,920 --> 03:08:18,080
but it is very frustrating to learn when you're still
especially because it's not like I said it's not casual

2647
03:08:18,080 --> 03:08:25,260
friendly I I can see myself liking this game if I'm playing
it in a more competitive environment but rank environment is

2648
03:08:25,260 --> 03:08:31,920
gonna be hell I can already tell especially I can tell
people are gonna be very toxic in rank especially if it's

2649
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:39,220
3v3 and that everyone will just be premaking everyone's just
gonna do pre-mades it's like apex where like you can't

2650
03:08:39,220 --> 03:08:45,940
really rank up and you can't really rank up in apex solo
queue like it's just easier of a pre-made it's just around

2651
03:08:45,940 --> 03:08:55,480
that type of vibe but like but like it's not but like you
can still solo queue it's just it will be a hundred percent

2652
03:08:55,480 --> 03:09:06,160
more frustrating similar to how apex solo queue is it is
it's just it's like a game that it's like a game that has

2653
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:13,420
basically all the stuff you've seen in other games but
combined into one fucking like pot

2654
03:09:16,540 --> 03:09:26,300
yeah but it's i it's not casual friendly 100 percent after
playing this like i don't know if casual players will like

2655
03:09:26,300 --> 03:09:30,300
it oh my god it's like god of war when i do that

2656
03:09:34,140 --> 03:09:38,860
it's a lot of different mechanics made into one type deal

2657
03:09:42,250 --> 03:09:53,590
yeah like i can see like what they're trying to do but it is
very overwhelming for a casual player like for me like you

2658
03:09:53,590 --> 03:10:01,710
know the moment i found a character i clicked with like
everything clicked for me you know like like how i'll take

2659
03:10:01,710 --> 03:10:07,930
that how like the moment it clicked i just like was just
killing everything with mara because i figured her out but

2660
03:10:07,930 --> 03:10:12,070
like the other characters you know i was just trying to be
like what the fuck do i do but for her like the moment i

2661
03:10:12,070 --> 03:10:17,210
figured it out it like it clicked instantly with like
movement gunplay and everything

2662
03:10:24,670 --> 03:10:33,830
it's just a lot it definitely is a lot and then obviously if
you have a team that comes with you that wants to play with

2663
03:10:33,830 --> 03:10:43,490
you you can do a lot of stuff with it it's very esporty type
deal it's like how the finals is not really casual friendly

2664
03:10:43,490 --> 03:10:52,770
it has a very it has a very like big esport market right now
like right now you guys didn't know you don't see the finals

2665
03:10:52,870 --> 03:10:56,090
Like, played a lot, like, a casual face.

2666
03:10:56,410 --> 03:10:56,950
Oh, my God.

2667
03:10:57,450 --> 03:10:57,930
That's bad.

2668
03:10:59,130 --> 03:10:59,510
That's bad.

2669
03:10:59,610 --> 03:11:00,310
They scanned me.

2670
03:11:00,730 --> 03:11:01,350
You know, I'm here.

2671
03:11:02,350 --> 03:11:04,190
I'm just gonna run away right now.

2672
03:11:04,330 --> 03:11:05,570
And I ran out of the way.

2673
03:11:05,710 --> 03:11:06,370
Wada, wada.

2674
03:11:10,410 --> 03:11:11,110
Foes spotted.

2675
03:11:12,510 --> 03:11:13,750
Firing on our foes.

2676
03:11:14,210 --> 03:11:14,910
I'm reloading.

2677
03:11:16,190 --> 03:11:17,470
Take this so long.

2678
03:11:21,810 --> 03:11:22,470
Foes here.

2679
03:11:23,010 --> 03:11:24,290
They're all heading to it.

2680
03:11:24,470 --> 03:11:25,570
Where is my team?

2681
03:11:25,590 --> 03:11:30,650

2682
03:11:33,710 --> 03:11:35,890

See this is what I have to do I just have to It's like I use
my teammates as diversion And then I just go the other way

2701

Like literally I think that's the strat I have to just rush

everybody Okay never mind Not everyone took it Yeah they
have to use it as bait It's literally Rainmaker.

2703
03:14:28,640 --> 03:14:32,040
Like, I'm literally playing that, like, Rainmaker, because
that's how I play, too.

2704
03:14:32,660 --> 03:14:34,940
Like, my teammates bait him in, and I go the other way.

2705
03:14:35,400 --> 03:14:37,040
Like, I'm literally using Splatoon strats.

2706
03:14:37,360 --> 03:14:39,940
I'm the use strategies from all different games that I play.

2707
03:14:41,200 --> 03:14:41,920
That's what I'm seeing.

2708
03:14:42,120 --> 03:14:48,140
It's like a combination of all different games type deal.

2709
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:54,540
Like, how do I breach this?

2710
03:14:54,560 --> 03:14:55,840
I don't know how to breach this area.

2711
03:14:55,840 --> 03:15:00,860
Reloading Reloading My blades await my sight

2712
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:17,560
Alright Alright

2713
03:15:23,090 --> 03:15:24,550
Alright I breached it

2714
03:15:37,410 --> 03:15:41,110
Jesus Christ Is there people behind me?

2715
03:15:41,530 --> 03:15:43,810
Like I said, the scat character is so strong

2716
03:15:55,690 --> 03:16:00,830
Distinguished Ready to bind death Nice.

2717
03:16:03,030 --> 03:16:03,550
Nice.

2718
03:16:06,910 --> 03:16:08,990
I got too cocky there.

2719
03:16:18,590 --> 03:16:19,390
That's fine.

2720
03:16:19,570 --> 03:16:20,110
He's not me.

2721
03:16:34,460 --> 03:16:35,020
I'm so dead.

2722
03:16:36,700 --> 03:16:37,840
Oh my god, I'm so dead.

2723
03:16:38,800 --> 03:16:40,140
Oh, I was sick though.

2724
03:16:40,560 --> 03:16:41,540
No, you got this!

2725
03:16:41,660 --> 03:16:42,760
Okay, these guys are good.

2726
03:16:43,340 --> 03:16:44,180
These guys are good.

2727
03:16:46,180 --> 03:16:46,500
No!

2728
03:16:50,770 --> 03:16:52,130
These guys are good.

2729
03:16:53,330 --> 03:17:07,450
Holy shit Team, your bomb's been diffused These guys are
really good No more spawns team My dark spawn rises Okay

2730
03:17:13,490 --> 03:17:21,870
The con- Oh my god, the conqueror is so OP I think the eagle
is so OP in general It really is

2731
03:17:24,910 --> 03:17:27,870
The eagle is just too good, in general.

2732
03:17:31,170 --> 03:17:32,190
Oh my god, fucking worse.

2733
03:17:41,580 --> 03:17:42,780
Taking damage.

2734
03:17:43,800 --> 03:17:45,040
I don't know why I'm taking damage.

2735
03:17:49,110 --> 03:17:50,410
Are you serious?

2736
03:17:50,610 --> 03:17:51,330
Over here?

2737
03:17:54,770 --> 03:17:55,890
Holy fuck!

2738
03:17:59,130 --> 03:18:07,890
yeah no the scouting is so fast too i feel like the cooldown
for the scouting is like really fast

2739
03:18:11,330 --> 03:18:15,390
yeah this one this is like one or more frustrating part

2740
03:18:20,190 --> 03:18:22,510
i cannot respawn here

2741
03:18:28,050 --> 03:18:34,950
oh we can't yeah that's what i'm saying it's such a

2742
03:18:39,090 --> 03:18:40,840
What is that?

2743
03:18:44,270 --> 03:18:45,490
That was a tough raid team.

2744
03:18:45,850 --> 03:18:46,730
Let's do better.

2745
03:18:50,290 --> 03:18:52,130
That was hard.

2746
03:18:52,650 --> 03:18:53,830
This team is good.

2747
03:18:54,530 --> 03:18:55,910
We needed a concord.

2748
03:18:56,450 --> 03:18:56,910
Right team?

2749
03:18:57,430 --> 03:18:59,670
We need a concord like the scouters.

2750
03:19:00,070 --> 03:19:00,530
This time wisely.

2751
03:19:04,810 --> 03:19:04,990
Yeah.

2752
03:19:05,010 --> 03:19:05,770
Yeah.

2753
03:19:05,950 --> 03:19:07,090
No, it's been upgraded.

2754
03:19:07,450 --> 03:19:08,290
Get it if you need it.

2755
03:19:08,330 --> 03:19:08,990
Oh, debug?

2756
03:19:09,250 --> 03:19:11,310
Yeah, I was gonna say, why is it not working?

2757
03:19:20,830 --> 03:19:21,610
Concord, yeah.

2758
03:19:21,850 --> 03:19:23,010
Is it not how you pronounce it?

2759
03:19:26,670 --> 03:19:28,310
We need like the scouter.

2760
03:19:28,430 --> 03:19:29,870
I think the meta is nearly...

2761
03:19:30,430 --> 03:19:30,990
What's her name?

2762
03:19:31,090 --> 03:19:32,570
Mara and Concord.

2763
03:19:33,330 --> 03:19:35,050
And then that would be meta.

2764
03:19:36,590 --> 03:19:36,890
Yeah.

2765
03:19:39,310 --> 03:19:50,730
Condor is a condor okay sorry I think meta is Mara and
condor because like her her and her fucking eagle is just so

2766
03:19:50,730 --> 03:20:04,590
fast the like the cooldown is way too fast in general like
you see if she like fucking threw that 20 times she threw it

2767
03:20:04,590 --> 03:20:06,690
like so many times on me too

2768
03:20:09,910 --> 03:20:11,430
We're not getting the package.

2769
03:20:15,910 --> 03:20:16,530
Airdrop ready.

2770
03:20:17,070 --> 03:20:17,730
Grab it if you need it.

2771
03:20:19,530 --> 03:20:26,970
I feel like if the cooldown was, like, bigger it'd be
better, but, like, it's just, it's so difficult.

2772
03:20:31,960 --> 03:20:35,520
We're definitely evenly matched here, I think.

2773
03:20:39,140 --> 03:20:40,580
Give this to my teammates.

2774
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:57,380
i always like forget which gun is on which i mean like keep
it consistent because i've been like um losing track on

2775
03:20:57,380 --> 03:21:01,880

2776
03:21:15,500 --> 03:21:21,920

2783
03:22:16,750 --> 03:22:19,090
I get, like, I want to shoot, you know?

2784
03:22:22,270 --> 03:22:24,150
Because there's, like, people literally in front of me.

2785
03:22:24,310 --> 03:22:25,310
It makes... I want to shoot him.

2786
03:22:46,700 --> 03:22:47,360
That's fine.

2787
03:22:52,240 --> 03:22:52,560
Okay.

2788
03:22:55,660 --> 03:22:56,140
Oh, my God.

2789
03:22:56,180 --> 03:22:57,520
Just move to the other side, please.

2790
03:22:57,880 --> 03:22:58,860
Move to the other side!

2791
03:22:58,940 --> 03:22:59,300
Don't go!

2792
03:22:59,520 --> 03:23:00,880
Why would you go here?

2793
03:23:04,530 --> 03:23:05,270
Oh, my God.

2794
03:23:05,470 --> 03:23:05,830
Why?

2795
03:23:05,830 --> 03:23:06,090
Why?

2796
03:23:15,140 --> 03:23:16,160
Oh my god, why?

2797
03:23:16,260 --> 03:23:17,560
Just move to the other side!

2798
03:23:17,660 --> 03:23:18,920
You have the shield!

2799
03:23:20,160 --> 03:23:22,220
Oh my god, he's so stupid.

2800
03:23:22,340 --> 03:23:23,820
He has to go to the other side.

2801
03:23:24,100 --> 03:23:25,920
He doesn't have to follow me.

2802
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:30,160
Oh, fuck, okay.

2803
03:23:31,280 --> 03:23:32,240
I don't know why he would.

2804
03:23:32,640 --> 03:23:33,680
Oh my god.

2805
03:23:34,300 --> 03:23:36,960
Like, why would you fight if you had the shield breaker?

2806
03:23:38,040 --> 03:23:39,660
You go to the other side.

2807
03:23:39,840 --> 03:23:41,380
Like, oh my god, that's so tilting.

2808
03:23:42,300 --> 03:23:43,280
That is so tilting.

2809
03:23:43,280 --> 03:23:45,760
Like, why would you fight?

2810
03:23:51,260 --> 03:23:53,140
Like, that's so stupid.

2811
03:23:54,040 --> 03:23:55,120
That's actually so stupid.

2812
03:23:55,640 --> 03:23:56,600
Like, like, you...

2813
03:23:56,600 --> 03:23:57,740
You bait...

2814
03:23:57,740 --> 03:23:58,280
Oh, my God.

2815
03:24:00,280 --> 03:24:01,680
Solo kill!

2816
03:24:05,890 --> 03:24:07,090
Solo kill!

2817
03:24:14,580 --> 03:24:16,840
Like, it's so intuitive.

2818
03:24:27,010 --> 03:24:27,930
Throwing grenade.

2819
03:24:28,910 --> 03:24:29,290
Okay.

2820
03:24:35,930 --> 03:24:37,590
Oh my god, you own this.

2821
03:24:37,690 --> 03:24:40,110
That the souls of the fallen fortify you.

2822
03:24:41,730 --> 03:24:43,570
Ready to find death.

2823
03:24:44,230 --> 03:24:45,050
I'm reloading.

2824
03:24:45,970 --> 03:24:47,330
We're getting close.

2825
03:24:47,690 --> 03:24:48,990
Just two enemies left.

2826
03:24:49,870 --> 03:24:50,950
Darkspawn summoned.

2827
03:25:01,590 --> 03:25:03,710
I see him.

2828
03:25:04,610 --> 03:25:05,330
Alright.

2829
03:25:05,490 --> 03:25:07,250
The enemy has dropped the shield breaker.

2830
03:25:07,970 --> 03:25:10,210
They gave the...

2831
03:25:10,210 --> 03:25:12,250
They gave the...

2832
03:25:12,250 --> 03:25:26,870
The... Okay, maybe you smarter I don't know if you noticed

Vanishing from ice.

A fucking horse.

Let the souls of the fallen fortify you.

2845
03:27:57,960 --> 03:27:59,280
Purge to soul.

2846
03:28:00,700 --> 03:28:01,460

wasn't.

2854
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:53,260
Oh my god.

frustrated because like um frustrated for that this is a

2867
03:30:07,610 --> 03:30:14,690
frustrating game um because like i thought he was with me

Grab that.

2875
03:31:17,060 --> 03:31:19,240
Actually, I feel like the cooldown is better.

2876
03:31:20,320 --> 03:31:22,960
Wait, what?

2877
03:31:36,090 --> 03:31:37,950
The Condor is just so strong.

2878
03:31:38,090 --> 03:31:41,330
When you don't have a Condor, it's such a hard game to play.

2879
03:31:44,210 --> 03:31:47,050
It's actually such a hard game to play if you don't have the
Scout.

2880
03:31:47,090 --> 03:31:47,790
How you doing, kid?

2881
03:31:48,090 --> 03:31:48,950
You fucking are gay.

2882
03:31:48,970 --> 03:31:50,870
It does so much.

2883
03:31:52,450 --> 03:31:53,450
Do I have a helmet?

2884
03:31:53,670 --> 03:31:53,830
No.

2885
03:31:54,510 --> 03:31:55,050
Buy that.

2886
03:31:57,850 --> 03:31:58,530
Yeah.

2887
03:31:59,130 --> 03:32:04,250
I'll take that.

2888
03:32:05,890 --> 03:32:07,430
Shieldbrokers forming at the throne room.

2889
03:32:07,650 --> 03:32:08,250
Marked it.

2890
03:32:09,270 --> 03:32:11,390
Keep forgetting that there's fall damage.

2891
03:32:13,790 --> 03:32:16,750
I can't get off the bear if I'm dropping down.

2892
03:32:17,070 --> 03:32:17,550
It's...

2893
03:32:27,780 --> 03:32:29,740
I might as well.

2894
03:32:30,640 --> 03:32:31,760
It's just a legendary.

2895
03:32:33,760 --> 03:32:36,700
I think it's a shitty gun, but it is a legendary.

2896
03:33:08,200 --> 03:33:09,560
Holy shit!

2897
03:33:11,220 --> 03:33:12,660
What the fuck?

2898
03:33:12,960 --> 03:33:13,560
Instantly!

2899
03:33:15,800 --> 03:33:17,160
Like, woolly...

2900
03:33:20,160 --> 03:33:30,680
like that's cool down that cool down is shit I fucking oh my
god my god

2901
03:33:34,550 --> 03:34:01,570
let me have the soul severed shit I need to try using this
chop and more

2902
03:34:07,710 --> 03:34:25,340
Oh I'm not playing very well my team is actually aim wise
they're good They're really good aim wise

2903
03:34:29,790 --> 03:34:38,550
Like they can these guys can aim but like Brain wise i don't
know we're getting into the overtime stretch

2904
03:34:44,160 --> 03:34:48,540
God fucking damn it They're using the ego.

2905
03:34:48,700 --> 03:34:49,860
They're using the drone.

2906
03:34:53,100 --> 03:34:54,660
Are you fucking crazy?

2907
03:34:54,680 --> 03:34:55,740
I'm riding out.

2908
03:35:05,900 --> 03:35:06,660
Listen up, group.

2909
03:35:06,920 --> 03:35:07,860
No more spawns.

2910
03:35:07,960 --> 03:35:09,600
We're an extra time.

2911
03:35:14,350 --> 03:35:14,390
Yeah.

2912
03:35:18,710 --> 03:35:19,310
Whoa.

2913
03:35:30,050 --> 03:35:31,230
Oh, fuck!

2914
03:35:35,000 --> 03:35:36,160
It's a lava here.

2915
03:35:36,340 --> 03:35:37,080
Protect yourself.

2916
03:35:37,240 --> 03:35:38,360
We're cornered.

2917
03:35:47,810 --> 03:35:49,950
Let my blades glide to victory!

2918
03:35:54,920 --> 03:35:56,820
I hear them.

2919
03:36:13,610 --> 03:36:14,950
It sucks because it's so scary.

2920
03:36:24,290 --> 03:36:25,110
Time's up.

2921
03:36:26,050 --> 03:36:26,810
Take this sonar.

2922
03:36:28,910 --> 03:36:29,390
Oh.

2923
03:36:29,730 --> 03:36:30,550
Get ready.

2924
03:36:31,070 --> 03:36:32,510
Siege tower coming in.

2925
03:36:32,570 --> 03:36:34,010
Oh my god.

2926
03:36:34,730 --> 03:36:35,150
Oh.

2927
03:36:36,410 --> 03:36:38,470
Oh my god.

2928
03:36:41,490 --> 03:36:42,750
All right.

2929
03:36:43,550 --> 03:36:44,550
All right.

2930
03:36:44,730 --> 03:36:46,790
Oh, so that's what overtime is.

2931
03:36:46,850 --> 03:36:49,470
Oh, so you- they literally have to push.

2932
03:36:49,930 --> 03:36:54,730
Wait, that's so- That's so, like, I don't know.

2933
03:36:55,770 --> 03:36:57,650
So you have to push them.

2934
03:36:59,550 --> 03:37:03,150
Oh, that's so- Like, see, every game I'm learning something
new.

2935
03:37:03,210 --> 03:37:05,570
Like, you have to push them, or it doesn't mean anything.

2936
03:37:06,010 --> 03:37:06,950
Like, as defense.

2937
03:37:07,050 --> 03:37:09,950
If you just- You can't let them hold onto it.

2938
03:37:09,970 --> 03:37:10,910
You have to kill them.

2939
03:37:12,410 --> 03:37:12,850
Yeah.

2940
03:37:18,120 --> 03:37:19,640
I guess it's because they don't lose health.

2941
03:37:19,660 --> 03:37:21,060
I guess

2942
03:37:24,260 --> 03:37:26,940
So we fucked it up then let

2943
03:37:47,910 --> 03:37:50,530
What the fuck

2944
03:38:14,020 --> 03:38:16,140
It will all be over soon.

2945
03:38:16,720 --> 03:38:18,420
Take this soul armor.

2946
03:38:19,360 --> 03:38:22,700
It belongs

2947
03:38:29,540 --> 03:38:30,420
to me.

2948
03:38:31,280 --> 03:38:31,620
Soul

2949
03:38:35,290 --> 03:38:35,570
armor.

2950
03:38:36,170 --> 03:38:36,630
Alright.

2951
03:38:38,270 --> 03:38:38,610
Oh.

2952
03:38:46,060 --> 03:38:47,220
Charge planting.

2953
03:39:08,550 --> 03:39:09,370
Is that breachable?

2954
03:39:09,410 --> 03:39:10,050
I can't tell.

2955
03:39:11,310 --> 03:39:12,910
See, it's so fast.

2956
03:39:13,010 --> 03:39:13,490
The cooldown.

2957
03:39:13,950 --> 03:39:16,470
How does she have another fucking scad?

2958
03:39:17,170 --> 03:39:18,610
Holy shit.

2959
03:39:19,030 --> 03:39:19,330
Static.

2960
03:39:19,630 --> 03:39:26,650
is so tilting that shit is so broken how

2961
03:39:33,970 --> 03:39:35,430
does she have another one

2962
03:40:05,700 --> 03:40:17,840
that's crazy no this gun actually sucks no it does it's fast
but it sucks throwing grenade i have too many of you holes

2963
03:40:17,840 --> 03:40:19,860
now though i fucked up a little

2964
03:40:46,200 --> 03:41:01,360
oh my god i carried that oh shit i did it i carried that oh
no i did it oh the beginning was rough for me yeah i was i

2965
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:06,980
was not doing so in the beginning but at least i carried in
the end They have, they have aim.

2966
03:41:07,160 --> 03:41:08,160
My team had aim.

2967
03:41:08,400 --> 03:41:09,180
I had brain.

2968
03:41:09,680 --> 03:41:10,500
I had brain.

2969
03:41:10,640 --> 03:41:11,180
They had aim.

2970
03:41:11,300 --> 03:41:13,520
I was literally finding all the breach spots for us.

2971
03:41:13,700 --> 03:41:16,300
I literally was like, okay, guys, we're going to go here.

2972
03:41:16,480 --> 03:41:17,540
I go breach this.

2973
03:41:17,640 --> 03:41:18,520
I breach that.

2974
03:41:18,940 --> 03:41:20,840
All right, we're all surrounding him.

2975
03:41:21,160 --> 03:41:23,500
I, no, they, they carried me by kills.

2976
03:41:23,820 --> 03:41:25,020
They literally killed everybody.

2977
03:41:25,180 --> 03:41:27,060
I like, I thought for us.

2978
03:41:27,260 --> 03:41:28,960
I'm thinking, me think.

2979
03:41:33,310 --> 03:41:34,970
Oh my God.

2980
03:41:36,550 --> 03:41:40,310
Oh, I breached so many walls for that.

2981
03:41:43,510 --> 03:41:45,090
Oh, my God.

2982
03:41:45,470 --> 03:41:49,210
We're a moment of Doki being the brains of the team.

2983
03:41:49,870 --> 03:41:51,930
Yeah, Alan, thank you for the super chat.

2984
03:41:52,330 --> 03:41:52,710
Thank you.

2985
03:41:53,010 --> 03:41:53,710
Thank you.

2986
03:41:55,430 --> 03:41:56,630
Holy shit.

2987
03:41:56,830 --> 03:41:57,790
Well, all right.

2988
03:41:58,650 --> 03:42:00,930
Final opinions about this game.

2989
03:42:01,330 --> 03:42:02,430
I'm not sponsored at all.

2990
03:42:02,670 --> 03:42:03,990
So, like, this is all from me.

2991
03:42:04,690 --> 03:42:05,110
Mara.

2992
03:42:05,790 --> 03:42:06,330
Mara.

2993
03:42:06,550 --> 03:42:10,850
And Condor, strongest fucking characters in the game.

2994
03:42:11,170 --> 03:42:14,290
That bitch had like 20 scouts.

2995
03:42:14,570 --> 03:42:16,270
I swear to the guy.

2996
03:42:17,170 --> 03:42:17,610
Holy shit.

2997
03:42:17,690 --> 03:42:20,930
She was spamming that shit every time.

2998
03:42:21,110 --> 03:42:22,430
It feels crazy.

2999
03:42:27,350 --> 03:42:30,070
But these two are the strongest, I feel.

3000
03:42:30,390 --> 03:42:31,650
I don't know about the other.

3001
03:42:31,770 --> 03:42:35,170
I don't know which third character would go with them.

3002
03:42:36,070 --> 03:42:36,530
But...

3003
03:42:38,010 --> 03:42:46,490
Condor and Mara strongest in the game Yeah, and like the
Mara shields are so fucking OP If you're a solo queue

3004
03:42:46,490 --> 03:42:52,470
player, you have to play Mara Yeah, you have to play Mara
Because like there's no way you can stand still all the time

3005
03:42:52,470 --> 03:42:57,590
That's the worst part Because like you have to be like stand
still so you don't get detected But there's no way to stand

3006
03:42:57,590 --> 03:43:09,530
still like 24 7 And like especially if you're in a fucking
fight So it's so strong Scouts is so strong like the Eagles.

3007
03:43:11,170 --> 03:43:15,350
Other stuff it is not it is not casual friendly.

3008
03:43:15,630 --> 03:43:17,530
I will be blunt with all you guys.

3009
03:43:17,770 --> 03:43:19,010
It is not casual friendly.

3010
03:43:19,350 --> 03:43:21,870
It is very a lot to learn.

3011
03:43:22,150 --> 03:43:28,830
Like I even realized that when you get to like you can just
hold it's literally you can just hold onto the hold onto the

3012
03:43:28,830 --> 03:43:31,070
shield breaker if they don't push you.

3013
03:43:31,190 --> 03:43:32,870
And then you just get a free shield break.

3014
03:43:33,150 --> 03:43:39,190
Like it's just like that if you're like if you really just
want to play it really close you just hold on to it until

3015
03:43:39,190 --> 03:43:46,570
the end and i didn't realize you could i didn't realize that
was a thing um it's very esport like yeah it's very esport

3016
03:43:46,570 --> 03:43:53,490
like uh you have to if you for rank i don't think i think
rank wise it's gonna be very frustrating for a lot of people

3017
03:43:53,490 --> 03:44:02,590
it was very frustrating for me even with quick play um yeah
and very you have to find friends to play this if you want a

3018
03:44:02,590 --> 03:44:08,370
really really good time either that or you come in your
quick play game You come in your casual games, which is

3019
03:44:08,370 --> 03:44:10,330
something that a lot of casual players don't do.

3020
03:44:10,770 --> 03:44:17,130
So casual play, I feel like it's very geared towards people
who are looking for something more competitive.

3021
03:44:17,690 --> 03:44:19,870
It's like, like I said, I will make the comparison to the
finals.

3022
03:44:20,210 --> 03:44:28,090
The finals has a really big competitive, has a really big
competitive fan base, but the casual wise, it's very hard to

3023
03:44:28,090 --> 03:44:28,650
get into.

3024
03:44:29,030 --> 03:44:31,110
I've heard, it's similar with Rainbow Six Siege.

3025
03:44:31,110 --> 03:44:39,050
Rainbow prestige, very good competitive esport fan base, but
casual play is pretty much dead in Rainbow 16 because the

3026
03:44:39,050 --> 03:44:41,510
entry point is just way too high for a new player.

3027
03:44:41,630 --> 03:44:42,950
It's just so hard to learn for a new player.

3028
03:44:43,350 --> 03:44:49,650
But like right now, everyone is learning, but I can see that
in the future, when the meta gets more established and like

3029
03:44:49,650 --> 03:44:56,830
people, when the meta gets more established, people are
going to do more like fucked up stuff.

3030
03:44:56,870 --> 03:44:58,730
Like right now everyone's trying to figure out what the meta
is.

3031
03:44:58,730 --> 03:45:05,350
everyone's trying to figure out how to fucking play this
game um and it is free though it is free you can play it you

3032
03:45:05,350 --> 03:45:17,990
can check this game out yourself um and uh yeah i feel like
if you yeah honestly like um i'm gonna be curious if there's

3033
03:45:17,990 --> 03:45:23,950
gonna be sbmm for this because it really depends on your
teammates for this game because like if you're in apex

3034
03:45:23,950 --> 03:45:28,530
there's so many people playing so like It's fine if you're
like that dead and so look at it, but for this it's like

3035
03:45:28,530 --> 03:45:35,650
straight up 3v3 And like yeah, the professionals they're
gonna love this fucking game because it's super competitive

3036
03:45:35,650 --> 03:45:38,430
It's super competitive the gunplay is really nice.

3037
03:45:38,510 --> 03:45:39,710
I love the gunplay.

3038
03:45:39,970 --> 03:45:45,690
I think the gunplay and the movement Like you know like how
the crouch spam is like really slow But like when you figure

3039
03:45:45,690 --> 03:45:52,130
out the movement it's actually really fun And then the
gunplay is also really fun the worst part about the guns

3040
03:45:52,130 --> 03:45:53,550
There's not enough bullets.

3041
03:45:53,770 --> 03:45:54,290
I swear to god.

3042
03:45:54,370 --> 03:45:59,930
I feel like I'm always running have to reload when you're
reloading and you just look at the other player it's so

3043
03:45:59,930 --> 03:46:00,760
awkward it's

3044
03:46:05,130 --> 03:46:15,970
it's it's so awkward when we both ran out of ammo on both
guns and we just look at each other and it's so awkward um

3045
03:46:19,050 --> 03:46:25,550
because that has happened so many times where i was just i
look yeah i'll be like what do we do now

3046
03:46:29,850 --> 03:46:37,310
yeah I'm not used to using my melee yet so definitely
something I have to figure out as well because I'm not used

3047
03:46:37,310 --> 03:46:46,470
to using my melee at the moment um yeah the reloading dance
I've done that so many times the reloading dance there is a

3048
03:46:46,470 --> 03:46:53,050
melee I just it is I haven't used it because I'm it's just
the game is so intense and enjoy obviously during the fight

3049
03:46:53,050 --> 03:46:59,430
the fights last so long too like Like I said, sometimes the
TTK is so fast, and then sometimes the TTK is so low.

3050
03:46:59,850 --> 03:47:01,530
It really depends on where you're located.

3051
03:47:01,670 --> 03:47:08,750
If you're fighting in the base, the time to kill is so high,
because, like, you can bounce around everywhere.

3052
03:47:09,050 --> 03:47:15,390
But if you're fighting in the goddamn fucking forest, it's
so low, because, like, it's just, and you're dead because

3053
03:47:15,390 --> 03:47:16,190
there's no cover.

3054
03:47:16,530 --> 03:47:19,510
But in the houses, it's very high because you're just
bouncing everywhere.

3055
03:47:19,510 --> 03:47:30,650
um um there is like the thing yeah like it it's it's in it's
like high and low depending on where you're fucking situated

3056
03:47:30,650 --> 03:47:38,690
in the map um there is yeah but uh yeah but if you have all
three of them looking at you you're fucking dead basically

3057
03:47:38,690 --> 03:47:50,330
um what else can I say um we'll see how it goes for this
game i i want to be optimistic but like definitely jeff has

3058
03:47:50,330 --> 03:48:02,010
not played the solo queue experience for sure i will say
jeff has definitely played with friends when he gave his

3059
03:48:02,010 --> 03:48:09,810
review for this game as a solo i can tell a lot of pro
players are going to be like this game is so fun oh my god

3060
03:48:09,810 --> 03:48:14,710
you guys and then all of you is like whoa this game looks
really fun but the thing with that is that me giving a solo

3061
03:48:14,710 --> 03:48:21,190
queue experience shows you guys how fucking frustrating it
is as a you're playing by yourself because you know a lot of

3062
03:48:21,190 --> 03:48:30,810
the really big popular games um it has a casual fan base
because um it has a casual fan base because you can solo

3063
03:48:30,810 --> 03:48:37,530
queue even if you you know you have no one to play with you
can play by play it by yourself but like this game i don't

3064
03:48:37,530 --> 03:48:43,910
know a lot of pros a lot of like big streamers who have a
pre-made stack they're gonna be like this is so fun they're

3065
03:48:43,910 --> 03:48:49,490
gonna sell it really hard because they are having a lot of
fun when i had a teammate that actually was calming when

3066
03:48:49,490 --> 03:48:56,330
when you're when they're actually calming and like figuring
stuff out with them it was fun it was really fun i enjoyed

3067
03:48:56,330 --> 03:49:02,090
it but then the moment the moment i got thrown like the
moment i got thrown in games no one calms no one knows what

3068
03:49:02,090 --> 03:49:08,490
the fuck no one's calming um we're just figuring out as we
go along it was frustrating it was very frustrating because

3069
03:49:08,490 --> 03:49:17,190
this is a heavily team-reliant game is very team-reliant you
can't it's very hard to solo carry yeah

3070
03:49:20,330 --> 03:49:24,890
yeah and people were playing the event they were all
pre-stacked they're all pre-made so of course they're gonna

3071
03:49:24,890 --> 03:49:29,990
have a lot of fun but yeah like if you're trying to check
this game out you're gonna have a lot of fun with friends

3072
03:49:29,990 --> 03:49:34,950
you're gonna have a lot of fun with a three stack or even a
duo duo three stack you're gonna have a lot of fun fuck the

3073
03:49:34,950 --> 03:49:40,850
random guy third guy who cares um If you're solo cute, good
luck.

3074
03:49:42,670 --> 03:49:43,610
It's a Gamba.

3075
03:49:44,250 --> 03:49:46,610
Good fucking luck if you're solo cute.

3076
03:49:46,870 --> 03:49:51,650
Because it will be the most frustrating experience of your
life.

3077
03:49:52,190 --> 03:49:59,680
Like, it will be very frustrating.

3078
03:50:02,060 --> 03:50:08,940
I will say, I am impressed with how optimized this game is.

3079
03:50:10,960 --> 03:50:21,200
it is 20 gigabytes and other than the fucking fight in the
first game other than the fucking fight in the first game

3080
03:50:21,200 --> 03:50:32,220
where like i for some reason lagged or some shit um it is 20
it is what 18 gigabytes it's 18 gigabytes and a lot of

3081
03:50:32,220 --> 03:50:41,100
people time to complain that it's poorly optimized it's 18
gigabytes though that's the thing i i don't want get why how

3082
03:50:41,100 --> 03:50:53,060
it how is it poorly optimized it's the file it's 18
gigabytes and um and like for me it ran pretty well for me

3083
03:50:53,060 --> 03:51:01,080
it's like but like it ran pretty well for me oh i am on 50
90 sorry guys i forgot i do have streamer privilege i

3084
03:51:05,300 --> 03:51:06,540
I forgot, guys.

3085
03:51:06,760 --> 03:51:07,060
Don't worry.

3086
03:51:07,280 --> 03:51:08,260
I'm, I forgot, guys.

3087
03:51:08,360 --> 03:51:09,740
I'm still one of you guys.

3088
03:51:09,840 --> 03:51:10,960
I'm still the people.

3089
03:51:11,440 --> 03:51:12,100
I almost forgot.

3090
03:51:12,300 --> 03:51:13,500
I do run a 5090.

3091
03:51:13,740 --> 03:51:15,780
It's very optimized for me with my 50.

3092
03:51:19,520 --> 03:51:20,120
All right.

3093
03:51:20,500 --> 03:51:20,880
All right.

3094
03:51:21,260 --> 03:51:21,480
Okay.

3095
03:51:21,640 --> 03:51:23,160
I don't know how it was.

3096
03:51:23,400 --> 03:51:23,640
Yeah.

3097
03:51:23,760 --> 03:51:24,120
Yeah.

3098
03:51:24,120 --> 03:51:24,700
I do.

3099
03:51:24,800 --> 03:51:26,440
I will have to be up front.

3100
03:51:26,560 --> 03:51:27,900
I do have a 5090.

3101
03:51:28,120 --> 03:51:30,240
So it's very well optimized with me.

3102
03:51:30,680 --> 03:51:32,120
Um, I'm in the one.

3103
03:51:33,040 --> 03:51:35,600
So I guess like, I don't know.

3104
03:51:35,800 --> 03:51:41,680
I don't know what the RAM and GPU situation is for this
game.

3105
03:51:44,160 --> 03:51:53,200
But I don't know like which one, which for people, like how
bad it is for people with lower graphics.

3106
03:51:53,880 --> 03:51:55,300
But I'm playing on medium, by the way.

3107
03:51:55,360 --> 03:51:56,180
I'm playing on medium.

3108
03:51:56,560 --> 03:51:57,440
I'm not playing on high.

3109
03:51:57,460 --> 03:52:00,840
I did play the first game, first couple of games on high
just to see what the graphics are like.

3110
03:52:01,040 --> 03:52:01,880
And I swapped the medium.

3111
03:52:02,020 --> 03:52:04,260
Obviously the pro players are going to play on low all the
time.

3112
03:52:04,440 --> 03:52:13,580
But I still, you know, see how pretty the game looks like at
least um you privileged i forgot i mean yeah i've been

3113
03:52:13,580 --> 03:52:23,680
thinking with super chat thank you thank you um um i don't
know i guess like if people are complaining about

3114
03:52:23,680 --> 03:52:31,420
optimization then i guess like you know it is what it then
it then it's not very well optimized because like for me i

3115
03:52:31,420 --> 03:52:37,800
was like oh it's 18 gigabytes and like everything seems fine
on my but then I do have a 5090 so um I do have the streamer

3116
03:52:37,800 --> 03:52:46,720
privilege I I do have the streamer privilege but if you guys
say it actually isn't very well optimized I believe you guys

3117
03:52:46,720 --> 03:52:56,740
um because like you know the general public don't have
access not have it 5090 but this is my job so um this is my

3118
03:52:56,740 --> 03:53:06,140
job so like I do have to have a good GPU because I play a
lot of video games but I guess I bought the 5090 before

3119
03:53:06,140 --> 03:53:08,780
prices went up, by the way, so thank fucking God.

3120
03:53:09,040 --> 03:53:10,980
Like, I literally dodged a bullet.

3121
03:53:11,100 --> 03:53:16,000
I bought RAM and my 5090 before AI got really bad.

3122
03:53:17,860 --> 03:53:20,220
I was very lucky in that department.

3123
03:53:21,880 --> 03:53:24,280
But I will believe you guys if...

3124
03:53:24,280 --> 03:53:27,000
I believe you guys, if you did say it's like...

3125
03:53:27,000 --> 03:53:29,140
People are saying it's not very optimized.

3126
03:53:30,560 --> 03:53:37,920
um and um yeah oh i've got s rank in splatoon before i've
done it before if you're doing like can you add getting s

3127
03:53:37,920 --> 03:53:46,260
rank i've done i've got s rank in splatoon one two and three
um um and that's why i was like i knew the strats for this

3128
03:53:46,260 --> 03:53:53,240
game regarding fucking rainmaker i hate rainmaker i hate
that game mode with passion um but literally it's like you

3129
03:53:53,240 --> 03:53:58,140
bait your teammates go left you go with your teammates to
left bait all the people on the left side and then you run

3130
03:53:58,140 --> 03:53:59,580
right side That's literally it.

3131
03:53:59,820 --> 03:54:01,460
That's literally the Rainmaker strat.

3132
03:54:02,680 --> 03:54:05,740
So that's what, like, I was like, guys, come on.

3133
03:54:05,880 --> 03:54:06,240
Go.

3134
03:54:06,480 --> 03:54:07,380
Right side.

3135
03:54:08,180 --> 03:54:08,900
Leave me.

3136
03:54:08,980 --> 03:54:10,160
Don't fight with me.

3137
03:54:10,560 --> 03:54:11,040
Run.

3138
03:54:16,500 --> 03:54:18,520
Um, uh, thank you for the raid, Eva.

3139
03:54:18,620 --> 03:54:18,820
Thank you.

3140
03:54:18,900 --> 03:54:19,520
Thank you.

3141
03:54:19,740 --> 03:54:22,740
So it's like lots of, so you need to know how to use.

3142
03:54:22,860 --> 03:54:28,580
It's like Valorant Strats, Rainbow Six Siege Strats, uh,
Splatoon Strats, Apex Gunplay.

3143
03:54:28,680 --> 03:54:32,760
It's like a combination of everything.

3144
03:54:33,640 --> 03:54:34,420
So that's my opinion.

3145
03:54:34,640 --> 03:54:35,520
Will I play this game again?

3146
03:54:36,500 --> 03:54:37,340
Not solo queue.

3147
03:54:37,720 --> 03:54:39,260
I will be frank with you guys.

3148
03:54:39,720 --> 03:54:41,700
I will not play this game solo queue.

3149
03:54:42,060 --> 03:54:43,500
It's way too frustrating.

3150
03:54:43,760 --> 03:54:45,320
Like I'm playing with you guys watching.

3151
03:54:45,480 --> 03:54:45,920
It's fine.

3152
03:54:46,180 --> 03:54:47,280
But I think off stream.

3153
03:54:47,760 --> 03:54:50,700
I will not play this off stream by myself.

3154
03:54:50,860 --> 03:54:55,020
Only because it's just way too frustrating playing it solo
queue.

3155
03:54:55,500 --> 03:54:57,020
If I play it off stream.

3156
03:54:58,960 --> 03:55:05,920
because there's just so much stuff you need to know like you
need to be able to coordinate with your team because if one

3157
03:55:05,920 --> 03:55:16,280
person is a fucking dead weight it's over it's like yeah
it's and then like i think calming and stuff calming your

3158
03:55:16,280 --> 03:55:23,480
teammates up we're like they're preaching this way and stuff
like that and be like coordinate alts and everything um yeah

3159
03:55:23,480 --> 03:55:38,320
that's that's my honest hope this game doesn't die like
concord um that would really suck but top i can tell rank

3160
03:55:38,320 --> 03:55:46,040
wise top 500 oh man i don't even know if i can find a
fucking pre-maid that would play with me to grind i think

3161
03:55:46,040 --> 03:55:52,720
like the pre-maids they'll be stuck there forever like
they'll the pre-maids for this like it's just like they'll

3162
03:55:52,720 --> 03:56:01,060
play together and that's the only people they play with i
feel like unless they're trying to grind for rank one um but

3163
03:56:01,060 --> 03:56:09,260
definitely for this game i don't see a lot of people
branching out from outside they're already established stack

3164
03:56:09,260 --> 03:56:17,100
especially if they're grinding in rank two because of how
yeah the like i feel like the top 500 grind for this game is

3165
03:56:17,100 --> 03:56:30,980
gonna be super intense i will be curious if this game will
be popular in a only because like Rainbow Six Siege itself

3166
03:56:30,980 --> 03:56:42,420
is not very popular in Asia it's very popular in EU and NA
but like I don't think this game could be strong in the Asia

3167
03:56:42,420 --> 03:56:55,260
market only because Siege itself isn't strong but Valorant
is strong yeah Valorant is strong in in Asia so depends

3168
03:56:55,260 --> 03:56:57,460
because there's Apex, and Siege.

3169
03:56:57,920 --> 03:56:59,800
So, Siege is not strong.

3170
03:57:00,060 --> 03:57:01,920
Valorant and Apex is strong in Asia.

3171
03:57:02,380 --> 03:57:03,540
But I don't know.

3172
03:57:03,740 --> 03:57:05,880
I honestly don't know if the...

3173
03:57:05,880 --> 03:57:06,320
Don't know.

3174
03:57:06,520 --> 03:57:07,400
It'll be...

3175
03:57:07,400 --> 03:57:09,320
It'll be...

3176
03:57:09,320 --> 03:57:10,100
We'll see.

3177
03:57:10,180 --> 03:57:11,220
We'll see how it goes.

3178
03:57:11,380 --> 03:57:12,540
We'll just see how it goes.

3179
03:57:14,220 --> 03:57:14,920
Anyway, guys.

3180
03:57:16,600 --> 03:57:21,180
I hope you guys had a fun time watching getting a glimpse
into...

3181
03:57:21,180 --> 03:57:22,640
Yeah, Splatoon is strong.

3182
03:57:22,820 --> 03:57:23,720
But Splatoon...

3183
03:57:23,720 --> 03:57:25,920
People also really love how cute Splatoon is.

3184
03:57:26,160 --> 03:57:37,880
um anyway that's my opinion on this game um as the solo
queue player i feel like the other streamers the other pros

3185
03:57:37,880 --> 03:57:44,940
they do give a different experience with a stack and it
might it definitely does look a lot fun in a stack in

3186
03:57:44,940 --> 03:57:50,360
general like i'm pretty sure the people in the stacks are
winning every fucking game they're fucking playing right now

3187
03:57:50,360 --> 03:57:54,700
um but this is my opinion as someone that

3188
03:58:00,330 --> 03:58:01,790
Yeah, it is.

3189
03:58:02,430 --> 03:58:04,510
Yeah, like, three stack, very fun.

3190
03:58:05,250 --> 03:58:07,610
Honestly, I think it'll be very fucking fun.

3191
03:58:08,310 --> 03:58:10,390
You'll enjoy it a lot with your friends because it's very
competitive.

3192
03:58:10,510 --> 03:58:11,310

You'll very much enjoy this.

3194
03:58:12,870 --> 03:58:18,010
If you're a casual player, good luck because it punishes you
hard.

I bumped into casual players on there and I literally just
gunned them down.

3198
03:58:27,790 --> 03:58:42,770

you're a casual player it's going to be very rough for you
