Okay, okay, so some of you guys might be wondering, who are the Sloppy Sisters and why are we Sloppy?

63
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,570
Why are we Sloppy?

64
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,110
Yeah, why?

65
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,450

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,550
Yeah, okay, I will start.

67
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,590
Hello everybody.

68
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,410
Hello, hello.

69
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:27,950
Hi.

70
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,150
What's up?

71
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,530
What's up?

72
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,190
What's up, bro?

73
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,350
My name is Mint Phantom.

74
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,730
I'm a ghost made VTuber and yeah.

75
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,970
Okay, your turn, lime.

76
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:42,890
Hello.

77
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,670
I am Lymu, I am so happy to be here.

78
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,090
I am a ferret VTuber.

79
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,890
I like mischief and hot chocolate and video games.

80
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,450
Ooh.

81
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,690
And last but not least.

82
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,310
Yeah, I'm Snuffy.

83
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,790
I'm a raccoon VTuber.

84
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,290
I love retro gaming and all sorts of things.

85
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,330
All right, yeah, so that's the Sloppy Sisters.

86
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,070
So if you guys didn't know, this is Lymu and Snuffy's very first concert.

87
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,030
Especially with it being 3D.

88
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,250
How do you guys feel about it being your first concert?

89
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,930
Oh, man.

90
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,130
I was so very nervous singing in front of everybody for the first time.

91
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:28,030
But then, like, when we were trying to figure out songs, I suggested doing Escape from the City as I'm a huge Sonic fan.

92
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,390
And Donkey said yes.

93
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,090
So that made me feel way more confident about performing.

94
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,910
Okay, did you guys like the song?

95
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,350
Okay.

96
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,250
Did you guys like the song?

97
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,470
Did you guys like it?

98
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,470
Yeah.

99
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,190
I'm glad.

100
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:49,110
But to be fair, Stuffy did try to suggest this to sing a My Little Pony song.

101
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,290
I can't believe you're calling her out like this.

102
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,630
All right, but Stuffy, how did you feel?

103
00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:00,910
Okay, well, I thought because Doki sang Five Nights at Freddy's, maybe she would be into that sort of thing.

104
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:01,990
I don't know.

105
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:09,390
Well, I'm just, oh man, I'm just so happy that I was able to get the sloppy sisters to be a part of my concert.

106
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,090
So I hope everyone is having fun so far.

107
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,270
Yeah, it's so fun.

108
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,830
Oh, and before we go, Oh, what?

109
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,170
Yeah, oh, oh, audience.

110
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,190
Oh, oh, oh.

111
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,350
And we know why we're all here today, right?

112
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,730
Because it is Doki Bud's birthday!

113
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,250
That's me!

114
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,730
It's my special day!

115
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,770
So before we go, can we all together sing happy birthday?

116
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,230
Yes!

117
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:45,690
Yes!

118
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,070
Yes!

119
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,630
All right, let me sit here then.

120
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,830
You guys sing for me.

121
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:50,490
Oh, what?

122
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,810
Okay.

123
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:51,790
Okay, okay.

124
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:52,690
Alrighty.

125
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,270
A one and a two.

126
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,670
Okay, sorry.

127
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,970
Oh, you'll get shy now.

128
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,030
I thought you wanted it to be a happy birthday.

129
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,410
Yay!

130
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,230
Okay, okay, okay.

131
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,450
Oh, okay, count us in, count us in.

132
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,090
Okay.

133
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,910
Three, two, one.

134
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,010
Happy birthday to you.

135
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,910

Thank you, everyone.

147
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,030
Goodbye to the sloppy sisters.

148
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,590
But don't worry, I'll still be here, guys.

149
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,130
Don't worry.

150
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,950
All right, bye-bye, slap your sisters.

151
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,410
Bye-bye, boys.

152
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:47,930
Bye, boys, boys.

153
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,030
Say bye, everyone.

154
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,740
You can never know what it's like.

155
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,460
Your blood like winter freeze is just like ice.

156
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,200
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you.

157
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,740
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mess we use.

158
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,460
And did you think this world could never win?

159
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,080
Well, look at me, I'm coming back again.

160
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,880
I got a taste of love in a simple way.

161
00:21:33,880 --> 00:22:00,180
And if you need to know I'm so saddening, you just fade away And don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did Looking like a true survivor, I'm feeling like a little kid And I'm still standing after all this time I'm breaking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

162
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,180
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,780
I'm still standing.

164
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

165
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Once I never could hope to win, You started down the road leaving me again.

166
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,520
The threats you made were meant to cut me down.

167
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,820
And our love was just a circus.

168
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,900
You'd be a clown by now.

169
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,180
And don't you know, I'm still standing better than I ever did.

170
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,060
Looking like a true survivor.

171
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:57,080
I'm feeling like a little kid And I'm still standing after all this time I'm taking off the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still standing Yeah, yeah, yeah

172
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:35,660
And don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did Looking like a true survivor I'm feeling like a little kid And I'm still standing after all this time I'm taking off the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing
