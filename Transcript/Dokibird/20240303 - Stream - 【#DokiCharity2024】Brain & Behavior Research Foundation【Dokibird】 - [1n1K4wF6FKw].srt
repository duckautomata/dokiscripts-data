Okay, I've been like refreshing the auction page and like...

5
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,020
Guys, why is a piece of paper at $1,500?

6
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,620

Okay, I'm gonna like sign like my signature all over it.

8

Like there's so many other cool things in the auction.

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,380
But the piece of paper already got to $1500.

38
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,440
Oh my god!

39
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,920
I literally, the market value for the thing is like $1.

40
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,120
It's a one.

41
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,080
I like how, oh I got the sniper.

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,080
There's a sniper in there too.

43
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,520

Welcome everybody.

54
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,740
To, um, hashtag Doki Charity 2024!

55
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,780
Welcome everyone!

56
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,960
This is actually, uh, really crazy.

57
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,420
Um, I've always wanted to do a charity stream.

58
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,780
Um, for the longest time.

59
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,800
Obviously, like, it has a lot of logistics to go around.

60
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,360
Um, I wanna give, uh, before I start talking more about the, uh, serious time.

61
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,380
It's a little bit of serious hour.

62
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,980
But, uh, before I wanna talk about the charity thing.

63
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,120
Uh, I wanna give a giant shout out to Little Men.

64
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,000
Um, they've worked incredibly hard, um, helping me with all of this.

65
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,320
Um, um, it's really, it's actually crazy having, um, um, such a wonderful assistant.

66
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,260
Um, helping me.

67
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,320
They've like, they actually contacted the foundation.

68
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:10,700
Because at first, Tiltify, um, the auction thing was actually a closed beta option.

69
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,180
And I didn't find out about it until Tuesday.

70
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,780
I didn't realize it was, because I thought that it was open to everybody.

71
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,780
So on Tuesday, I was getting ready to set up the auction.

72
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,580
And I looked at it, and I was like, wait a minute.

73
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,240
It's closed beta.

74
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,480
And I was like freaking out.

75
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,680
I was like, oh my god, guys.

76
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,180
I was like, guys, it's closed beta.

77
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,220
Can you guys like contact Tiltify?

78
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,440
And like, tell them to grant me special permission.

79
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,160
Because I really wanted to access the auction.

80
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,900
And, um, so little men, um, they helped.

81
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,520
They were in contact with Tiltify staff.

82
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,780
And actually gave me the beta, like the option.

83
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,740
Because like, the auction is like reserved for like really big streamers and stuff like that.

84
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,860
So like, obviously like, um, uh, cutie Cinderella for Twitch, uh, did like an auction stream.

85
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,280
As well as a lot of big streamers use the auction feature on Tiltify.

86
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,140
I didn't realize that it was reserved for like big streamers.

87
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,460
Like really big streamers and events.

88
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,860
So I was just like, fuck.

89
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,260
I was just like, oh shit, okay.

90
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,960
That, okay, I fucked up there.

91
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
I didn't realize that was a thing.

92
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:39,840
And so, um, so, um, like I said, a huge shout out to, uh, little men for helping me get in touch with Tiltify.

93
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,120
Like Tiltify people to give me the power to be able to host an auction.

94
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,620
But not only, holy shit!

95
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,800
16,000!

96
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,180
Oh my god!

97
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,820
Okay, to be fair, okay.

98
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,320
At first, I didn't want to include the auction.

99
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,060
Like, the auction fits into like the stretch goals.

100
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,940
But I decided that's not really fucking fair.

101
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,260
And it's all for charity.

102
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,480
So like, I'm like, you know what, Doki?

103
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,520
Be nice.

104
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,520
Give the dragoons.

105
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,600
Give the dragoons a bone.

106
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,040
It's all for charity.

107
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,760
I was like, okay.

108
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,260
It's all for charity.

109
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,500
I will add the auction to the stretch goals as well.

110
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:40,300
Um, anyway, anyway, as I was saying, as I was, as I was saying, um, because of that, then I realized the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation was not on the list for auctions.

111
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,620
And I was like, fuck.

112
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,680
Because like, when we got access to the auction, I was like, okay, little man was like, all right, you can do it.

113
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,840
You can, you can host auctions now.

114
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,480
And I was like, yay!

115
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,420
And I was like, trying to do it.

116
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,880
And I was like, wait, where's Brain and Behavior Research Foundation?

117
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,820
They're on Tiltify.

118
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,820
Why aren't they on the auction?

119
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:11,780
And then, so then, little man had to like, um, get in touch with the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation organization.

120
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,960
And, you know, uh...

121
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,020
Um...

122
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,460
They actually had like a contact, uh, within the organization.

123
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:27,720
And they managed to, the organization, the foundation managed to connect, uh, their account to Tiltify to receive, uh, auction donations and everything.

124
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,600
And that was, we were able to do that yesterday morning.

125
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,900
Um, they actually, uh, we have had everything set up at like five in the morning on Friday.

126
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,780
Five in the morning on Friday.

127
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,360
And then on Friday, we, um...

128
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,880
Uh, they worked on, uh, putting everything, all the items and everything, um, onto the auction list.

129
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,060
And, um, they were the ones, little man was the ones that were in contact with all the creators.

130
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:08,800
And all the, uh, all the creators and like, uh, all the artists and all the wonderful creative people around the world in coordinating all the items that are gonna be made.

131
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,540
Uh, for, that was gonna be made for this auction.

132
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,480
So, like I said, a huge shout out to little man for doing all of this.

133
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,920
It's really amazing.

134
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,940
I didn't have to, I didn't have to do all of this myself.

135
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,420
I had incredible help from little man.

136
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,340
Especially with contacting all the official people.

137
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,140
Helping me write all the business emails.

138
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,220
So I don't have to write the business...

139
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,380
I think that's like the best part.

140
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,980
I don't have to write the business emails anymore.

141
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,460
Like, I think that's the part that makes me the happiest.

142
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,860
Cause like, you know, writing emails fucking suck.

143
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,560
I hate, I fucking, I hate, I hate writing business emails.

144
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,340
And I hate writing like professional emails.

145
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,100
So like, huge shout out to little man for helping me write the professional emails.

146
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:09,420
Especially contacting like Tiltify and, um, contacting Tiltify and, um...

147
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,440
And Brain and Behaviorist.

148
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,200
And the Behavior Research Foundation.

149
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,260
Also, um, I wanna say thank you to everybody that applied for, to be part of the auction.

150
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,500
It was incredibly difficult picking, um, the creators.

151
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,960
Cause I didn't wanna have like too many, like, you know, like, phew.

152
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,640
Like, overwhelm everybody with a lot of items and everything.

153
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:40,000
Um, so, um, it was very difficult for me to, uh, pick like the items that I want for the auction themselves.

154
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,300
Um, so, um, we actually got more than 200 applicants to be part of the auction.

155
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:56,920
Um, it was very, very difficult, uh, deciding, like, narrowing down 200 people.

156
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,080
Um, um, little man actually helped out in helping me narrow down the first round.

157
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,260
And in the second round, I had a hundred and, like, I think it was like 300 applicants, I believe.

158
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,580
It was around, like, 300 plus applicants.

159
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,660
And little man narrowed it down to 180 for me.

160
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,460
And then from that 180, I had to pick around 30 people.

161
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,260
Um, I don't actually know the exact number I picked, but like...

162
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,960
From 180, I had to narrow it down even further, um, to what we have now.

163
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:40,240
Um, like I said, it was incredibly difficult picking, like, uh...

164
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,360
The people to, uh, to be part of this auction.

165
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,400
Um, and I want to say thank you again to all everybody who are donating, um, the items.

166
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Um, I told everybody that I was willing to, uh, chip in and fund because I didn't...

167
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,180
I was... this was like a paid opportunity.

168
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:07,220
Um, but like also like a huge, uh, thank you to those who, uh, wish to donate those profits to, uh, to charity as well.

169
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,280
Holy shit!

170
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,160
Did someone donate $5,000?

171
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,240
$5,000?

172
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,860
Okay, guys.

173
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,960
I need a...

174
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,160
Who the fuck did...

175
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,740
Guys, give me a second.

176
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,540
Let me open my Tiltify real quick.

177
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,340
Holy fuck!

178
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay.

179
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,480
Guys, I've only been streaming for like 20 minutes, guys.

180
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,300
I've only been streaming for 20 minutes.

181
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,400
Oh my god!

182
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,660
Holy shit!

183
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,100
Scott!

184
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,040
Thank you for the $5,000!

185
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,260
Oh my god!

186
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,300
Holy shit!

187
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,240
Thank you for the $5,000!

188
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,860
Um, and yeah, anyway...

189
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,080
Fuck, I lost my train of thought.

190
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,100
What was I saying?

191
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,320
What was I...

192
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,120
I already lost my...

193
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
My train of thought right now.

194
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,640
Holy shit!

195
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,440
Okay.

196
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,520
Um...

197
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,640
Anyway...

198
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,500
Anyway...

199
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,900
Like I was saying, it was incre...

200
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,240
It's just...

201
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,120
Um...

202
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,660
Crazy.

203
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,820
It's crazy because like I'm so happy to be able to do something like this.

204
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,760
To be able to do an auction for you guys.

205
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,040
Because like it allows me to work with so many talented people.

206
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,960
All the items in the auction is one of a kind.

207
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,280
Two of a kind.

208
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,240
Mostly one of a kind.

209
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,740
Because I might have...

210
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,820
I might have one too.

211
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,640
But like...

212
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,500
This is a sweater.

213
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,360
Exclusive!

214
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,260
One of a kind!

215
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,020
Okay!

216
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,900
Okay!

217
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,920
Look, I will also own it one too.

218
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,420
Okay?

219
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,540
But that doesn't count.

220
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,860
Um, I will also own...

221
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,280
Yes!

222
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,000
I will have the piece of paper!

223
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
It's literally paper that I own!

224
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,700
Okay!

225
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:13,500
Okay, but it will be one of a kind for the dragoons plus me, okay?

226
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,280
I will also own one as well.

227
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,840
So then we're matching!

228
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,520
Look, I've had this argument already with my members, okay guys?

229
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:29,560
It means we will be matching and that raises the value, okay guys?

230
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:39,380
Us having matching items raises the value of the item itself because we will be matching.

231
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,860
It is live edition paper!

232
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,940
It's my paper!

233
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,500
Who else would have touched the paper other than me?

234
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,660
Just think about it!

235
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,540
It literally has...

236
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,940
My fingerprints!

237
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,060
Okay, wait, actually I'm gonna touch it with gloves.

238
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,160
No, that's actually pretty bad if it has my fingerprints on it.

239
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,040
I would be touching the paper with a glove.

240
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,200
So it would sadly not have my fingerprints on it.

241
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:23,780
It would not have my fingerprints on the paper.

242
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,540
Because I realize that's a bit scary to get my fingerprints on.

243
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,780
But wait...

244
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,560
Also, I am providing the money for shipping for all of these items.

245
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:50,000
So do not worry if you're... wherever you live, you're like, oh my god, would they be able to ship it there?

246
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:58,380
I will be providing the money for the shipping to the creators who will be shipping these products to you if you win the auction.

247
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:11,280
And also, even if some of the items are not made by me, is not coming from me, I will be sending an exclusive postcard to each winner of the auction.

248
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:22,240
So each winner of the auction will be able to receive an exclusive postcard made just for this event.

249
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,340
How are we already...

250
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,660
It's crazy.

251
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,540
It's actually...

252
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,380
Guys, the insane...

253
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,100
The insane amount of support from everybody.

254
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,960
Like, we were just starting.

255
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,300
I'm just explaining the event right now.

256
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,000
And like, I'm like, refreshing the like, auction page.

257
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,000
And seeing... everything's been bid.

258
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,140
It's insane.

259
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,460
Everything has been like, already bid on.

260
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,640
And...

261
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,540
And like...

262
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,340
And like...

263
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,480
Oh my God, there's so much money.

264
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,980
Like I said, all the money goes directly towards...

265
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,740
It goes directly towards the foundation.

266
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,140
It doesn't go to me.

267
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,900
It goes directly straight to the foundation.

268
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,880
Like, everything's already connected to like, their accounts.

269
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,780
So, they 100% receive the money.

270
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,520
I don't receive anything for those who are like, oh my god, don't care you're gonna receive any.

271
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,160
No, I will not be receiving any of the money.

272
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,020
It goes directly to them via Tiltify.

273
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:46,140
For those who want to know what is the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation.

274
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:57,500
They are a charity that looks at providing funding into research for cures and better treatment for mental illness.

275
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,680
So this is like a global thing.

276
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,680
It's not like within one particular country.

277
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:15,820
It looks into treatments and cures for global research for mental illness and mental disorders.

278
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,880
So they provide majority of funding.

279
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:26,580
Because I know there's a lot of charities that are going into like salaries and programs and stuff like that.

280
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,420
And like all about the offices and stuff.

281
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:38,180
But the reason why I chose the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation is that majority of the funding.

282
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,100
Like majority of the money that is raised for this charity organization, for this foundation.

283
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,120
Goes directly to the brain and behavior research foundation.

284
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,260
And funding the research and stuff.

285
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,520
And because I chose it because of also the global appeal.

286
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,740
Because you know finding cures and finding treatments is not like...

287
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,000
It's not like you know centered around one country.

288
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,120
If they find a cure or a better way to treat something for mental illness.

289
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:14,400
Like people around the world will be able to go for the medicine for it as well.

290
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,120
So it's not like oh you have to go to the doctor.

291
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,680
Or you have to go to this country to be able to receive it.

292
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,780
It is a cure.

293
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,940
It is a better treatment for people around the world.

294
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,980
And that is why I chose this as...

295
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,940
That's why I chose the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation for this particular event.

296
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:37,360
For the charity and also because people around the world can also donate to this as well.

297
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,940
And because I've set up the YouTube thing.

298
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,600
The YouTube fundraising thing.

299
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,300
Which is more about raising awareness.

300
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,020
Raising programs for it.

301
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,960
A better support system for people with mental illness.

302
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,940
With mental disorders.

303
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,800
On the YouTube one.

304
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,360
Because it was something I could do like quick and instantly.

305
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,600
And something I wanted to do on YouTube.

306
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,160
Because you know a lot of people's eyes were on me.

307
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,540
And it was like the thing I could do right away to help out.

308
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,760
And the Mental Health America helps with that.

309
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,960
So Mental Health America is more so about raising awareness.

310
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,360
And providing support structures and programs.

311
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,860
While the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation is more about trying to find the cure.

312
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,300
And finding better treatment.

313
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,720
And so that's why I felt like you know do two of these at around the same time.

314
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Is the best like way regarding this.

315
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
So one if you want to donate to the research.

316
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,520
You can go with the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation.

317
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,940
For the one regarding mental health awareness.

318
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,820
There is the Mental Health America.

319
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,680
That you can donate via the waiting room.

320
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,600
The one the Mental Health America is sadly only has like specific countries.

321
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,240
Can be able to donate via the waiting room.

322
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,680
And that's why I made the Tiltify for like global donations.

323
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,700
So you don't have to worry about like oh well.

324
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,760
Will they be able to accept my donation.

325
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,360
Because I saw there's a lot of issue regarding it.

326
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,920
On the waiting room was that a lot of countries were not able to donate.

327
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,580
To the waiting room.

328
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,320
And that's why I decided to do this particular stream.

329
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,160
And this auction.

330
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,180
To raise money for a second charity as well.

331
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,960
Another 5k?

332
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,200
Guys I was doing a fucking TED Talk.

333
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,900
Holy shit.

334
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,800
Who is it?

335
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,360
TrickyDTayori1000.

336
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,200
Thank you.

337
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,780
Thank you.

338
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,620
Oh my god.

339
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,440
Thank you guys.

340
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,200
Holy fuck.

341
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,220
This is insane.

342
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,140
This is actually.

343
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,200
Welcome to my TED Talk.

344
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,400
That'll be 5k per ticket.

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,940

367
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,140
How much did we make on the auction alone?

368
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:39,940
This is.

369
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,460

Holy shit.

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,560
It went to 4k.

378
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,420
And then that troll point was like.

Because of this.

427
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,800
Paper is too damn expensive.

And then you're off the screen again.

442
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,380
You're off the screen again.

00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,720
Yeah, anyway.

496
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,940

Whoa!

537
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,230
Alright.

538
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,330
This one.

539
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,710
The Last Dab Experience.

540
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,450
Okay.

541
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,510
Let's go.

542
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,350
Yeah.

543
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:01,970
Alright.

544
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,990
It's called The Last Dab Experience.

545
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,350
Alright, we're gonna...

546
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,870
Over 91% pepper.

547
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,030
Okay.

548
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,270
Um...

549
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,010
It's apparently 2 million.

550
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,370
SHU.

551
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,030
Oh...

552
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,590
I will show it later.

553
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,570
We will do this after I talk about...

554
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,330
After I talk about the charity.

555
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,950
About the auction items.

556
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:36,210
Guys, there's other stuff I want to talk about...

557
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,470
before we get to the hot sauce.

558
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,590
There's so many things I haven't done on The Stretch Clothes yet!

559
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:46,710
I was joking!

560
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,590
I haven't even like talked about the stretch.

561
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,290
We haven't gone to any of the actual content of the charity event.

562
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:59,490
What I've been talking about is just like monitoring what the fuck is going on.

563
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,870
Oh my god.

564
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,350
Wait, I love this.

565
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:10,670
I love like how they're like fighting so hard right now over the...

566
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,910
over the piece of paper.

567
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,670
Over the piece of keyboard.

568
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,290
Okay, I like this.

569
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,780
So it's between these two people right now.

570
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,380
These two people are fighting it out for the keyboard.

571
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,600
This is not the paper.

572
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,520
This is for the keyboard now.

573
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:42,800
I honestly will not be surprised if Trollboy is gonna like bounce in between like different auction items.

574
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,260
Just a one.

575
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,480
Just a one.

576
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,940
I'm gonna win something.

577
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,560
I will not be surprised.

578
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,920
Anyway.

579
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,360
Anyway.

580
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:58,740
As I was saying, does anyone know how far we've raised currently for the auction itself, chat?

581
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,880
I'm actually curious.

582
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:07,060
How far have we currently raised from just like overall?

583
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,440
52,000?

584
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,020
Oh my god.

585
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,260
What?

586
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,060
We made 52,000 from the auction alone.

587
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,480
By the way, the auction itself will be 24 hours.

588
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:36,220
So it's going to close tomorrow at... it's gonna close tomorrow at I believe 12 p.m.

589
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,480
PST.

590
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:44,040
So give time for those around the world to be able to bid because I know it's like super fucking early right now in Asia.

591
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,180
Like it's like 5 or 6 a.m.

592
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,580
over there.

593
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:56,260
So because of that, we are making sure the auction gives enough time for a bunch of dragoons from around the world to be able to bid on it.

594
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,660
So you know, they don't have to wake up super early and stay up for the rest of the day to like snipe each other.

595
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,260
Anyway, I can finally introduce the items.

596
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,100
Okay.

597
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,860
Alright.

598
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,780
I will finally be able to introduce...

599
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,000
the items of which that is gonna be part of the auction.

600
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,220
Let me find the folder.

601
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,880
I was more prepared earlier, but now I'm like, whoa!

602
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,380
Anyway.

603
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,380
The first item that I'll be talking about...

604
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,780
Okay, I'm gonna refresh.

605
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,740
I'm just gonna go by order from the...

606
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,020
I'm gonna go by order from the site itself.

607
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,300
So.

608
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,920
The first item is...

609
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,740
The...

610
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,000
We have like several amazing...

611
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,300
sculptures and figure makers.

612
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,780
Like I said, this is all like one of a kind.

613
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,840
To the dragoons.

614
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,660
Some might say it's two of a kind because I will also own one.

615
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,600
But let's all just agree that it is one of a kind.

616
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,840
It will never be released.

617
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,760
Re-released.

618
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,500
You will own...

619
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,720
It's one plus one.

620
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:16,900
You can buy it.

621
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,340
One plus one equals one.

622
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:20,880
One plus one equals one.

623
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,980
One plus one equals one.

624
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,260
By the way, guys.

625
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,420
So...

626
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,200
Quick maths right there.

627
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,140
Anyway.

628
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,220
Anyway, as I was saying.

629
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,600
Only one in public circulation.

630
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,740
Yes!

631
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,240
I like that.

632
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,540
Only one in public circulation.

633
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,920
So.

634
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,740
As I was saying.

635
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,780
The first item on the list.

636
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,840
Is...

637
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,220
Is a custom Doki sculpture.

638
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,640
Is a custom Doki sculpture.

639
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,080
By Exeon Figures.

640
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,760
I don't know.

641
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,580
I'm so sorry if like...

642
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,840
I am mispronouncing your name.

643
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,080
I am mispronouncing your name.

644
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,420
Because I'm very bad at that.

645
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,600
So this is the...

646
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,760
This is not the actual figure itself.

647
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,300
This is an example of what they can do.

648
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,820
This is an example of what they can do.

649
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,740
They have input on the sculpture itself.

650
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,240
In the design.

651
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,860
But this is an example of the type of sculptures and sculpting they can do.

652
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,120
They can give you two options for this.

653
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,760
Obviously, one is the file to print your own sculpture.

654
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,840
Like 3D print your own sculpture.

655
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,240
If you do have a 3D printer and paint it yourself.

656
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,140
Or the creator of the sculpture.

657
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,120
A custom Doki sculpture.

658
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,440
Yes, yes, yes.

659
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,020
It's Bey.

660
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,120
But it's the example they have.

661
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,040
Because by winning this auction.

662
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,460
You can have your input.

663
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,280
And...

664
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,440
You can have your input.

665
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,660
On...

666
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,220
On how it would look like.

667
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,760
And...

668
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,400
Basically, the second option is that...

669
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,680
They can make an unpainted...

670
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,440
Resin version.

671
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,820
Of...

672
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,100
They can make an unpainted...

673
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,880
Resin version.

674
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,940
Of the...

675
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,220
Sculpture themselves.

676
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,780
And it will be shipped to you.

677
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,900
So you can like paint it yourself and everything.

678
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,920
But the...

679
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,000
But it's also made of resin.

680
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,700
So it is...

681
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,280
So...

682
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,660
So obviously it is...

683
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,520
Very high quality.

684
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,600
And everything.

685
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:39,960
Um...

686
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,500
What else am I...

687
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,800
What else do I want to talk about?

688
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,820
Um...

689
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,780
Like I said, each auction...

690
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,680
Will be...

691
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,520
Each auction winner will be sent an exclusive...

692
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,000
An exclusive...

693
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,380
Postcard.

694
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,280
So...

695
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,220
Everything...

696
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,040
Even if it's like something regarding no physical item.

697
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,740
You will also be sent...

698
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,320
Um...

699
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,940
You will also be sent the postcard.

700
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,820
An exclusive signed postcard from me.

701
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,660
Um...

702
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,820
So that is...

703
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,840
Number one.

704
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,780
Is a custom Doki sculpture.

705
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,080
Uh...

706
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,300
Number two.

707
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,700
The second item.

708
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,900
That I'll be showing.

709
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:17,920
Is...

710
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,900
Wow!

711
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,900
A one of a kind.

712
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,160
Um...

713
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,820
Custom...

714
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,960
Doki bird themed PC.

715
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,740
This...

716
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,560
Is not just a PC case.

717
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,240
It will also be...

718
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,940
A customized...

719
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,140
Fully built...

720
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,800
Doki...

721
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,660
PC.

722
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,520
So it's not just a case by the way.

723
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,920
I know some people were wondering...

724
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,680
If it's like just a PC case or not.

725
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,860
But it will also be a fully customized PC.

726
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,020
That fits around like...

727
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,100
Me.

728
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,200
That would be like around my color scheme and everything.

729
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,420
Um...

730
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,860
So this is by Celeste Fleur.

731
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:01,780
Um...

732
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,980
It was valued at $3,500.

733
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,660
Like including the PC parts and everything.

734
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,940
Um...

735
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,880
And now it's at $6,100.

736
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,120
Wow!

737
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,980
So like the PC parts itself...

738
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,000
Was...

739
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,960
Um...

740
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,040
Was going...

741
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,520
Was...

742
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:18,860
Uh...

743
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,660
$3,500.

744
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,600
Including the customization.

745
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,780
Um...

746
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,200
This is not from Hyatt.

747
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,300
This is actually from...

748
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:26,900
Uh...

749
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,700
A...

750
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,260
Um...

751
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,240
A user...

752
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,840
Uh...

753
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,180
Named Celeste Fleur.

754
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:31,820
Uh...

755
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,420
Who is using a Hyatt case.

756
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,460
Just so you guys know.

757
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,120
Uh...

758
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,520
I just want to...

759
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,620
I just wanted to clarify.

760
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,180
For those who are confused.

761
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,180
Um...

762
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,060
This is actually just using a Hyatt case.

763
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,960
So...

764
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,360
Um...

765
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,280
It will be...

766
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,960
Uh...

767
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,900
So it's valued at $3,500.

768
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,460
Uh...

769
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,020
Um...

770
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,500
Including the parts itself.

771
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,400
And like the decorations and everything.

772
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,660
Um...

773
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,120
And...

774
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,780
Yeah.

775
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,800
So it's not just a case.

776
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,120
I know a lot of people are confused.

777
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,700
That it was just going to be the case itself.

778
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,400
But no.

779
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,040
It is a fully...

780
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,460
Cus...

781
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,960
Like fully made custom PC.

782
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,600
Um...

783
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,020
I...

784
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,020
It is just a case.

785
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,060
Item number three.

786
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,900
The cookie cutters.

787
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,520
These are so cute.

788
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,100
I love...

789
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,440
These are actually so fucking cute.

790
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,480
Oh my god!

791
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,900
Alright.

792
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,500
Anyway.

793
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,480
So the cookie cutters.

794
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,760
Item number 3.

795
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,100
From Reesoo.

796
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,940
So there are multiple cookie cutters.

797
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,300
There's...

798
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,220
It's multiple styles.

799
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,580
But each auction item that you bid on will come with two cookie cutters.

800
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,740
One will be my face and the other one will be a dragoon.

801
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:53,660
So it is basically your pick on whether you want the dragoon to have a knife or you want the dragoon with no knife.

802
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,560
The chunky goons.

803
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,600
So this is item 3 to like insert...

804
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,320
3 to 4, 5, 6, 7.

805
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,640
Item 3 to 7.

806
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,720
The different expressions of cookie cutters.

807
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,940
And I think it's very very fucking cute.

808
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,980
And I love how...

809
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,760
I love how like one of them is like, I will learn how to bake cookies if I win this auction.

810
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,140
I love the fucking...

811
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,600
You guys are so creative.

812
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,260
You're like...

813
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,600
Some of this like, never baked cookies in my life.

814
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,900
And I will drop an entire paycheck for this.

815
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,520
The one guy is like, I never baked cookies in my life.

816
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,000
But I need this.

817
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,420
This is now the next...

818
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,920
This is my life now.

819
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,820
I will learn how to bake all the cookies if I have this cookie cutter.

820
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,680
Oh my god.

821
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,420
There's another guy that's like, I just won something for $500.

822
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,420
I only have $500.

823
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,580
Please.

824
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,300

825
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,780

I need this exclusive...

827
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,520
Exclusive postcard.

828
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,540
Anything that's under $500.

829
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,500
Please.

830
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,600
Anyway.

831
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,400
That is item 3 to 4, 5, 6.

832
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:18,640
Sorry.

833
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,660
I'm really bad at counting.

834
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,580
3 to 7.

835
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,440
Alright.

836
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,400
Next item on the list.

837
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,880
The next item on the list.

838
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,800
Boop.

839
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,500
Alright.

840
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,360
The next item on the list is a...

841
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,220
I know this is not me.

842
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,860
I know that is...

843
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,080
I know that is Sakura Miku Hatsune.

844
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,500
I know that, guys.

845
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,520
But this is...

846
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,480
This is an example of their...

847
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,080
Oh my god.

848
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,980
The next item is Hatsune Miku?

849
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,240
Doki.

850
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,380
I did not realize you were Hatsune Miku.

851
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,560
Thank you.

852
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,860
Is that Doki, but pink?

853
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,940
Anyway.

854
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,160
Anyway.

855
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:11,020
The next item on the list is a custom Doki sign print from this artist.

856
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,500
This artist's name is...

857
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,100
I'm so sorry.

858
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,380
I'm definitely going to butcher your name.

859
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,740
Aircell?

860
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,000
Aircell?

861
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,820
My mod would be linking their Twitter.

862
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,680
Their Twitter and chat.

863
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,180
So this you can see the art style.

864
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,220
I would be printing, don't worry, it's going to be a high-quality print.

865
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,300
Do not worry.

866
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,740
Do not worry.

867
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,720
It's not going to be like paper.

868
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,900
I mean, it's paper.

869
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,100
But it would be like, nice paper.

870
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,540
It would be very nice paper.

871
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,120
OK, guys...

872
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,720
It's not going to be...

873
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,400
You know like when you're at anime conventions and then...

874
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:04,400
You know like okay, so like you know like anime conventions where you're buying like anime prints.

875
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,160
It's gonna be like that, but signed.

876
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay?

877
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,900
I love paper.

878
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,600
Like 4.4k nice.

879
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,700
I don't know like I don't know it would be that nice, but it would be nice.

880
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,060
It'll be pretty good.

881
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,380
Really nice colors too.

882
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:34,680
I'll make sure it'll be very good colors like the best quality type of colors and the best quality type of paper that you can get.

883
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,940
And I will be signing it!

00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,600
So it will be a Doki sign print from this artist.

885
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,060
Beautiful art style.

886
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,440
Really lovely colors and everything.

887
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,180
So this is an example of their art style.

888
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,420
Like it's on paper?

889
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,580
Fuck yeah!

890
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,160
Oh my god, don't you don't need to say anything more.

891
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,460
It's on paper.

892
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,160
That's all I need to know.

893
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,620
Anyway.

894
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,540
Next item on the list.

895
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,960

Alright.

897
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,520

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,080

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,380
75 sheets of paper!

910
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,660
Guys.

911
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,020
75 sheets of paper in one.

912
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,940
But it's not signed.

913
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,340
Okay.

914
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,580
You want to see the picture?

915
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,820
Oh, get an exclusive signed postcard!

916
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,540
Okay.

917
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,060
That's almost like it was signed!

918
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,500
Anyway.

919
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,700
Anyway, it's more than one.

920
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,260
Anyway, this next item from Ravenmon.

921
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:43,240
I was very surprised when Ravenmon wanted to join the charity auction.

922
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,880
Because I actually very heavily admire ReRi's stuff.

923
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,540
Ever since like I saw them at like like like online stores.

924
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:51,560
Ever since like I saw them at like like online stores.

925
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,320
I'm at Artist Alley.

926
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,860
They won't know who I am.

927
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,640
It's been years.

928
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,020
I actually own multiple items from RiRi.

929
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,520
Like for years.

930
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,380
Because they are like... they've been doing Artist Alley for a really, really long time.

931
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,180
So actually, I've seen them at convention and I've actually...

932
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:13,800
They will never know!

933
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,460
They'll never know who it was.

934
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,380
So, I'm actually... heavily admire RiRi because I've actually owned several of their...

935
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,540
Like, merch that they've made in Artist Alleys.

936
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,940
And so, yeah.

937
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,320
I'm really, really happy that they're part of the charity auction.

938
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,480
Bro, it wasn't even four years ago!

939
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,720
It might be like eight years ago.

940
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,380
They've been like... they've been doing Artist Alley.

941
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,560
And like selling stuff online for so long.

942
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,080
Like, it wouldn't even be four years.

943
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,320
Maybe like eight.

944
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,500
Maybe like eight years ago.

945
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,580
Like, they are like a veteran to Artist Alley and conventions.

946
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,780
Okay, and then I like... I will not be surprised if RiRi was like, I have not been selling for eight years.

947
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:16,220
And before they come in and call me, I was like, Doki, I have not been selling for eight years.

948
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,920
That is... that is not true.

949
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,580
Okay.

950
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,020
Well, it felt like eight years.

951
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:27,560
Okay?

952
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,760
It felt like eight years.

953
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,880
Anyway... anyway...

954
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,720
It is a sticker book with exclusive stickers.

955
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,760
Obviously, I believe the stickers will be based around me.

956
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,280
Unless they're random stickers.

957
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,200
But I think it's healthy to assume it's gonna be about me.

958
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,140
You're right.

959
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:48,940
I'm a veteran.

960
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:49,900
A hard and...

961
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,980
I knew it!

962
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,060
I knew it!

963
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,700
I was like, eight years does feel like a really long time though.

964
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,760
So like, maybe it wasn't eight years.

965
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,740
But I knew!

966
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,620
I just know that I was... I bought something from her.

967
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,680
Maybe eight years ago.

968
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,400
Anyway,

969
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,940
as I was saying...

970
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,180
So yeah, this is gonna be a sticker book!

971
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,400
Yay!

972
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,200
With seven years.

973
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,340
And I'm gonna be five sheets of paper.

974
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,320
That's a lot of paper, guys.

975
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,320
It is a lot.

976
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,940
Alright, next item!

977
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,120
Next item on... on the list.

978
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:25,980
Let's see.

979
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,220
What is...

980
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,220
Where is it?

981
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,420
Where... where is the...

982
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,260
Where is the...

983
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,200
Uh...

984
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,200
Okay, this one is...

985
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,560
Whoa, this one is a big one.

986
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,380
You can see the beautiful R.

987
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,340
Alright!

988
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,640
The next one on the list.

989
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:45,980
Um...

990
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,660
A custom signed metal poster!

991
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,280
I will be signing these!

992
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,800
I believe, cause it says sign...

993
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,860
Alright.

994
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,380
This is not just regular paper.

995
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,520
Oh my gosh.

996
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,820
This is...

997
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,580
Okay, I'm gonna...

998
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,420
I can't...

999
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,000
It is not just regular paper.

1000
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,240
But metal paper.

1001
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,600
Well...

1002
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,680
Look, there is a tier list.

1003
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,080
Metal paper.

1004
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,480
Sticker paper.

1005
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,700
A4 paper.

1006
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:29,820
So...

1007
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,160
That one is...

1008
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,100
This is gonna be a signed...

1009
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,100
It's gonna be shiny.

1010
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:35,880
Okay?

1011
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,540
It is going to be shiny.

1012
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,440
Garbage!

1013
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,980
What the fuck you talking about?

1014
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:40,720
Hahaha!

1015
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,600
But...

1016
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,820
It's gonna be...

1017
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,940
It's gonna be metal paper.

1018
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,000
Um...

1019
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,220
And the artist is Paranoia.

1020
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,180
www.

1021
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,420
Um...

1022
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,280
And so...

1023
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,700
Obviously, it is a...

1024
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,720
Your character here.

1025
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,140
So, they will be drawing you and me together.

1026
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,420
Uh...

1027
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:02,820
And...

1028
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,260
I need to read this whole thing.

1029
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,100
Sorry, I didn't read the...

1030
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,780
Hahaha!

1031
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,400
So, you choose one of the three poses...

1032
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,680
That they've given...

1033
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,120
Uh...

1034
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,740
Given you...

1035
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,400
To choose from.

1036
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,340
If you win the auction.

1037
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,340
And...

1038
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,740
Obviously, it says like...

1039
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,340
What they can and can't draw.

1040
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,440
So, there are like...

1041
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,500
Stuff you can't do.

1042
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,720
And stuff you can do.

1043
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,500
Um...

1044
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,400
And then also their...

1045
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,880
Beautiful art style!

1046
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,420
Their art style is so fucking pretty!

1047
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,860
Oh my god!

1048
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,260
It's actually gorgeous.

1049
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,500
And that is the other...

1050
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,240
Next item...

1051
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,660
Next item on the list.

1052
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,120
What's after that?

1053
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:39,960
Oh!

1054
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,680
We're in the plushy territory now!

1055
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,440
I think...

1056
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,320
I think we might go back to like non-plushy areas too.

1057
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:46,980
Um...

1058
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,580
Let's see...

1059
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,360
Where is the...

1060
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,080
Where did I put the...

1061
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,640
Okay, here we go.

1062
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,040
Next item on the list!

1063
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,140
It's gonna be a plushy!

1064
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,280
Also, what I love about like...

1065
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,340
All of the...

1066
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,260
Creators that are...

1067
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,340
That are part of this...

1068
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:08,780
Auction...

1069
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,400
Is that...

1070
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:09,940
Everybody...

1071
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,280
Chose a different...

1072
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,380
A lot of people chose different outfits.

1073
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,900
It's not just one outfit, obviously.

1074
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,560
I had many, many outfits.

1075
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,540
So it's really nice, cause it's like...

1076
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,440
Um...

1077
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:22,900
Um...

1078
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,040
All different outfits...

1079
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,500
Uh...

1080
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,580
Are represented...

1081
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,240
Um...

1082
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,020
In the auction.

1083
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,400
So if there's like a particular...

1084
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,720
Doki fashion that you like...

1085
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,000
Uh...

1086
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,820
Maybe you'll find it in one of the auctions.

1087
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:34,800
Um...

1088
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,180
Anyway!

1089
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,700
So this is by Rimi Plushies!

1090
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:39,820
Um...

1091
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:39,920
Rimi Plushies!

1092
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,680
It is 36 inches sitting!

1093
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,000
That is a really big plushy!

00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,780
And when I saw this...

1138
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,160
I was like...

1139
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,280

1140
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,020

1146
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,000
That is not paper!

1147
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,080

1148
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:08,640

Everybody will have paper in the end!

1152
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,180

I was so confused!

1160
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,760
I was actually incredibly confused!

1161
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,740
And then I had to like...

1162
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,420

1163
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,400

1185
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,300

The designs they sent me...

1189
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,240
Um...

1190
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,880
Because I had to look at the pictures to actually realize like...

1191
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,620
What is that?

1192
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,020
I'm sorry!

1193
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,520
I'm not good with like...

1194
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,740
Technical stuff!

1195
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,640
Guys...

1196
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,760
I'm sorry!

1197
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:08,800
Guys...

1198
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,360
I'm not good with like...

1199
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,500
Technology...

1200
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,060
Okay...

1201
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:12,920
To an extent...

1202
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,120
I am okay with technology...

1203
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,980
To an extent...

1204
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,080
But like...

1205
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,500
I was so confused...

1206
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,320
Because I didn't know...

1207
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,960
What the fuck IEM was...

1208
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,680
So...

1209
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,760
This would be like...

1210
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,720
The concept...

1211
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,160
That they've like...

1212
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,980
Given us...

1213
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,620
Um...

1214
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,460
So you can see...

1215
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,240
It has my Oshimark...

1216
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,740

1217
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,620
And everything...

1218
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,400
Um...

1219

So you can see...

1220
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:38,760
So you can see...

1221
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,580
You can have like...

1222
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,000
You know...

1223
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,240
Um...

1224
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:40,800
Like I said...

1225
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,740
One of a kind...

1226
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,480
In public circulation...

1227
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,020

From other people...

1232
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,280
So...

1233
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:52,780
So...

1234
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,700
This is like...

1235
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,000

1239
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,020

00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,120
So here are the credits...

1290
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,060

1293
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,740
Of the...

1294
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,700
Um...

1295
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,160
Of the IEM...

1296
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,080
Um...

1297
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,020
Guys...

1298
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,200
I swear to god...

1299
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,660
How much has the A4 paper gone for now...

1300
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,620
I swear...

1301
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,640
Oh my god...

1302
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,780
£4,400...

1303
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:11,200
Okay, they stopped 37 minutes ago.

1304
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,200
Okay, that is very reassuring.

1305
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:23,360
That is very reassuring that the war has stopped now.

1306
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,540
I feel a lot better.

1307
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,060
Okay.

1308
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:35,240
Anyway, next item on the list.

1309
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,920
This is very... this is an interesting one.

1310
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,020
It's really, really cute.

1311
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:49,280
So, this is a sterling silver dragoon necklace.

1312
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,400
It is made from sterling sticker.

1313
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,500
It is from Kotaku... Kotaku... Taku?

1314
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:03,500
And it is a full on necklace pendant.

1315
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,220
I believe it is also included.

1316
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,140
It includes a chain for it as well.

1317
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:13,000
So, it's... you gotta have your chonky goon with you.

1318
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,020
On your neck at all times.

1319
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,160
Yeah, sterling silver too.

1320
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,480
Their work is absolutely beautiful.

1321
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,580
I remember looking at their portfolio for everything.

1322
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,800
And, oh my god, they have like Mario stuff too.

1323
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,780
Like, I'll show you guys.

1324
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,880
I'll give like a shout out to their Etsy.

1325
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,180
Like, look at their... the stuff they have made.

1326
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,460
It's actually crazy.

1327
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,200
Like the Mario star pendant.

1328
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,280
And it's actually really well done.

1329
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,440
Like the stuff they've made on their Etsy store.

1330
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,120
So, huge shout out to their work.

1331
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,520
It was beautiful to see their portfolio.

1332
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,120
But yes!

1333
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:02,420
The sterling silver chonky goon is this item.

1334
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,410
Alright, the next one is...

1335
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:11,200
Although I do have a Doki Makura in my official shop.

1336
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:21,160
You can have a chance to own an exclusive one of a kind in public circulation Doki Makura.

1337
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,260
Uh...

1338
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,980
I buy... I buy King Biscuit.

1339
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:32,940
Which I would admit is sexier than anything I've ever seen.

1340
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:35,280
Whew!

1341
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,720
This has to beơ...

1342
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,960
So fucking high.

1343
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,800
Like, it was like, we're about to get banned, Doki!

1344
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,200
NO!

1345
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,700
Don't show this to the public!

1346
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,200
So...

1347
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:03,860
Uh...

1348
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:08,520
This is by Keen Biscuit.

1349
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,660
Like I said, one of a kind.

1350
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,640
Doki Makura.

1351
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:22,420
It's just so fucking hot that only one can be made and owned at all times.

1352
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:34,640
So I hope whoever wins this is a very lucky individual in accurate talking.

1353
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,900
Alright.

1354
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,680
Alright, anyway.

1355
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:43,640
Anyway.

1356
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,980
Okay.

1357
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,680
So anyway.

1358
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,640
That is this item in the auction.

1359
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,380
It's life-size.

1360
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,540
Yes, it is.

1361
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,660
It is life-size.

1362
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:11,620
It is very accurate to how I actually am proportion-wise.

1363
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,040
It's all waste.

1364
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,540
Also the butt too.

1365
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,100
Also the butt.

1366
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,140
Alright, anyway.

1367
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,040
Anyway.

1368
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,420
Yes, it's automatically accurate.

1369
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,800
The anatomy is very accurate.

1370
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,860
Alright, anyway.

1371
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:35,840
Anyway.

1372
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,040
That is this item in the auction.

1373
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,780
Alright, next up.

1374
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,000
Next up.

1375
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,640
This is not a physical item.

1376
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,400
So there is no picture.

1377
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,920
There is no picture.

1378
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,740
This is not a physical item.

1379
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:58,920
This is basically I will collab with an indie or streamer of your choice.

1380
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,140
So I'm just going to read out the description.

1381
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:14,720
But basically, if you win this auction, you can pick an indie Vtuber or like a streamer of your choice.

1382
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,760
Who is your favorite streamer.

1383
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,360
And you want to give them like a big break.

1384
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,540
You want to have more eyes on them.

1385
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,380
And I will try to reach out to them for a collab.

1386
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,600
And I will try to reach out to them for a collab.

1387
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,300
Obviously, it is up to their choice if they wish to collab with me.

1388
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:29,600
Obviously, it is up to their choice if they wish to collab with me.

1389
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:36,780
And if they do decline, obviously you will have to give me a plan B on who to reach out after.

1390
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:37,560
And if they do decline, obviously you will have to give me a plan B on who to reach out after.

1391
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,500
And if they do decline, obviously you will have to give me a plan B on who to reach out after.

1392
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,320
And if they do decline, obviously you will have to give me a plan B on who to reach out after.

1393
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:48,400
And if they do decline, obviously you will have to give me a plan B on who to reach out after.

1394
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,980
Big in the streaming community and have a chance to have a lot of eyes on them.

1395
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,940
And be able to maybe have this like a big break for them as well.

1396
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:03,740
So that is one of the... this is the one the non-physical items.

1397
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,740
Non-physical items that I'm giving.

1398
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,520
But yeah, anyway.

1399
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:16,740
Next item on the list is also a non-physical item.

1400
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,060
Pick a game for me to stream.

1401
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:26,000
So if there is a game that you've always wanted me to stream.

1402
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,760
But I chose to ignore you.

1403
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,900
I will not be able to ignore you anymore.

1404
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,240
By winning this auction.

1405
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,680
Except for Visage.

1406
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,860
Because that is a stretch goal.

1407
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:56,340
So by winning this auction for pick a game for me to stream.

1408
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:04,920
You can force me to stream your favorite game to completion on stream.

1409
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,920
So it will not be to 100%.

1410
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,300
It will be to like the end of the story.

1411
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,060
And that is within TOS obviously.

1412
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,820
Like so I can stream it.

1413
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,180
And like...

1414
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,300
There is no MMOs.

1415
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,820
MMOs are not allowed.

1416
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,580
Just so you guys are wondering.

1417
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,560
MMOs are not allowed by winning this.

1418
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,560
Because there is no way to fucking complete MMOs.

1419
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,340
But I will stream it to completion.

1420
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,440
Obviously if you try to be like super cheeky.

1421
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,980
And be like oh my god.

1422
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,900
What about Destiny 2?

1423
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,060
Because there is no end to Destiny 2.

1424
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,380
Because they will keep ruining it.

1425
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,560
And releasing missions and like stories and DLCs.

1426
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,740
That is not allowed.

1427
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:54,920
I can like...

1428
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,960
You can't be cheeky on this.

1429
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:57,500
You can't.

1430
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:03,680
I am giving you a chance to be like play an RPG game.

1431
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,200
Like a JRPG game.

1432
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,440
Because I choose not to play JRPG games.

1433
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,380
Because I know.

1434
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,060
I know that like for me.

1435
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,140
JRPGs and me just do not mix very well.

1436
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,420
I haven't found one that I actually enjoyed.

1437
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:19,300
So...

1438
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,500
This is your chance.

1439
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,800
To force me.

1440
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:25,940
If you win the bid.

1441
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,120
To force me to stream a JRPG.

1442
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:32,480
Especially when JRPGs are like fucking 100 plus hour fucking streams.

1443
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,180
Even if you are speed running to the end.

1444
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:35,460
Um...

1445
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:36,900
Um...

1446
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,720

It is.

1451
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,330
The piece of paper.

1452
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:57,570
Ha ha ha.

1453
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:58,410
Ha ha ha.

1454
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:00,590
Ha ha ha.

1455
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:02,750
Ha ha ha.

1456
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,210
This is.

1457
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:09,150
The next item on the list.

1458
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:10,570

I will cover it up.

1462
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,710
How did that go up?

1463
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,010
Three minutes ago?

1464
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:25,550
You haven't been bidding for like one hour that you came back?

1465
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:32,510
This person hasn't bid for an hour?

1466
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:37,250
And then they're like, this is it, this is my time to shine now.

1467
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:44,890
I'm waiting for...

1468
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,490
Anyway, they just like showed up.

1469
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:50,350
They literally stopped bidding when it was at $3,000.

1470
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:55,650
They stopped at $3,000 and they had to go to the bank.

1471
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:59,270
Sorry, they had to make like a quick deposit real quick, you know.

1472
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,350
They had to do some quick like...

1473
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:06,010
They had to take a quick loan real quick to be able to keep going.

1474
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:06,810
Anyway.

1475
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:12,470
So, this piece...

1476
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,490
Yes, it's not just a piece of paper.

1477
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,370
I literally wrote that it's going to be a piece of paper covered with my signature.

1478
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:21,190
So I'll be like writing my signature on it.

1479
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:24,490
Anyway, anyway.

1480
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:27,270
So it's not just pure white paper.

1481
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,390
I will have...

1482
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:31,010
I would taint it with my signature.

1483
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,030
That's why the paper is now 10K.

1484
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:39,110
I'm going to be like, So, anyway.

1485
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:42,310
That is that item on the list.

1486
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:46,710
Next item on the list is...

1487
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:58,110
A private one-to-one gaming session with me of any game of your choice.

1488
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,130
So it will go maximum three hours maximum.

1489
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:05,530
Because like, I don't know if you suddenly pick like a two-hour game.

1490
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:06,170
Like what the...

1491
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:10,490
So...

1492
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,550
We will be setting...

1493
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:14,150
If you win this...

1494
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:16,190
If obviously if you win this...

1495
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:16,930
Okay, it's going to be multiplayer.

1496
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:18,570
You can't be like, Oh my gosh.

1497
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:21,110
I want a private one-to-one gaming session with Doki.

1498
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:22,070
I'm going to make her play this.

1499
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:22,850
That doesn't...

1500
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:23,850
That's not how it works.

1501
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:25,190
It's just a multiplayer game.

1502
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:27,430
It's going to be a...

1503
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:30,370
A multiplayer game guys.

1504
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:34,070
But it is going to be a private session.

1505
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:36,830
Three hours maximum.

1506
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:47,910
And why wouldn't you spend with Mr. Man or other little man and I will be like coordinating schedule to figure out like it'll be on one of my rest days.

1507
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:52,350
Obviously, it'll be on one of my rest days and we will play together.

1508
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,370
The private session.

1509
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:54,750
It won't be streamed or anything.

1510
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:57,590
It'll be like a one-to-one session for charity.

1511
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,170
Yeah, that is that chair that item.

1512
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,110
How many more do we have?

1513
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:06,890
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

1514
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:07,850
Oh my gosh, we have 24.

1515
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:09,410
Sorry.

1516
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:12,130
This has to be the longest ad session ever.

1517
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,100
That's great because then I don't have to...

1518
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,440
I don't have to fucking worry about eating the hot sauce yet.

1519
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:29,580
I have 20 more items before I get to eat the hot sauce.

1520
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:33,700
Hey.

1521
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:34,820
Anyway.

1522
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,820
The 24-hour unskippable.

1523
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,340
That's how I like my ads.

1524
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:42,820
Unskippable.

1525
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,700
No plugin can save you.

1526
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,020
Weird fucking...

1527
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:50,380
No ad blocker or plugin can save you now.

1528
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:51,560
All right.

1529
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,260
Next item on the list.

1530
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,080
Let me grab the picture for this one.

1531
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,260
Where did I put it?

1532
01:08:59,440 --> 01:08:59,780
Okay.

1533
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,640
Auction photos.

1534
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:05,260
Also, shout out to Lil Man for compiling all the photos for me.

1535
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,940
Into like one folder.

1536
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:08,900
Thank you.

1537
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,480
I love it.

1538
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:14,060
Next item on the list is a drag...

1539
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,440
I'm going to mispronounce like what it's called.

1540
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:19,080
A dragoon amigurumi.

1541
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,740
So by HeyitsJ.

1542
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:30,000
So you get to have a chance to win two dragoon crochet plushies.

1543
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:31,980
One wears a shirt.

1544
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,860
They're not naked.

1545
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,820
They have a shirt on.

1546
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:41,520
So this is your chance to win both of them.

1547
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,400
It's not just one, but two of them as well.

1548
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:48,860
So this is incredibly cute.

1549
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:49,420
I love crochet.

1550
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,720
Crochet is so fucking hard.

1551
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:53,000
I was like watching a video on like...

1552
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,460
What's it called?

1553
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,220
Wubbles?

1554
01:09:54,560 --> 01:10:02,240
Apparently this like viral TikTok like crochet kit or something called the Wubbles or something.

1555
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,100
It's like the Wiggles, but like I guess less Australian.

1556
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:06,200
I don't know.

1557
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,480
Wait, are they from New Zealand?

1558
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:08,980
I can't.

1559
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,920
I'm sorry, Australians, New Zealanders.

1560
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,940
I get you guys confused.

1561
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,980
Which one is which?

1562
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:14,540
Like what?

1563
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,740
I mean, I don't get the country confused.

1564
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,140
I get like who's from where?

1565
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,500
Like, like, because like the accents are a little bit similar.

1566
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:26,780
So like I don't remember if like if there's like a famous actor.

1567
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,420
I'd be like, are you New Zealand or Australian?

1568
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:30,920
I sometimes forget.

1569
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,640
Oh, anyway.

1570
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:36,800
But anyway.

1571
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:51,560
I was like watching a video on like Wubble kit or whatever, like, like some arts and crafts YouTuber that that was like introducing the Wubbles and it's some like viral crochet kit.

1572
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,200
And they were like, I have never done crochet before.

1573
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,900
So we're going to see if it is beginner friendly.

1574
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,580
And I was like, what the fuck?

1575
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,560
I was just like watching like this is beginner friendly?

1576
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,320
I was just like, holy fuck.

1577
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,080
Like, oh my God.

1578
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,240
I cannot do arts and crafts.

1579
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,520
Arts and crafts is like, I can't.

1580
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,360
I don't have like, first off, I don't think I have the patience.

1581
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:17,820
The last time I had the patience for arts and crafts stuff is when I think this is like, I don't know.

1582
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:21,740
This is like a, this is like an Asian thing.

1583
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,060
Like when you're a kid.

1584
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:29,340
But there's these like arts and crafts where you can fold the paper into these like triangle pieces.

1585
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,460
But you draw.

1586
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,180
That's art.

1587
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,890
Drawing is just art.

1588
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:38,450
There's just art.

1589
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:40,330
There's no crafting in it.

1590
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:43,370
There's no, there's no crafting.

1591
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:44,750
It's just art.

1592
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:45,830
Anyway.

1593
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,450
Anyway, it's not, I mean, it's not really origami.

1594
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:53,570
I'm not talking about origami, but like it's like using origami to make something.

1595
01:11:53,870 --> 01:12:01,230
But like, it's basically you make these little triangle things and then you piece these triangle things together into a structure.

1596
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,910
Um, and I used to do that.

1597
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:06,670
Um, as a kid.

1598
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:08,450
Like I would fold a lot of these.

1599
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:09,430
Like triangles.

1600
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:12,310
And then it would be like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1601
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:13,350
And then there's Doraemon.

1602
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:15,510
I have one.

1603
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,150
Cause they, they always sell them at Daiso.

1604
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:20,790
They, I remember as a kid.

1605
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:23,510
They always had these kits at Daiso.

1606
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:26,270
And then I would buy like the hamster.

1607
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:27,430
I have the hamster one.

1608
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:29,550
And then I had like Doraemon.

1609
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,290
And then I did that.

1610
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:34,330
Um, I did that as a kid.

1611
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:36,450
Is that what it's called?

1612
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:37,450
The Tangram?

1613
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,290
The Tangram?

1614
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,230
But yeah, that was like the extent of my crafting.

1615
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:42,970
I also did like plushie making.

1616
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,690
Um, for school.

1617
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:49,490
Um, but like, um, it was, it was a bit of a mess.

1618
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:53,750
It was a bit of a mess.

1619
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:54,570
Anyway.

1620
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:55,830
Holy shit!

1621
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,050
We're $48,000?

1622
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,250
Oh my, don't worry.

1623
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,930
I have a list of stretch goals just in case this happened.

1624
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:06,530
I was, I was like a little bit, I was like, okay.

1625
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:10,710
Thinking of stretch goals is like one of the hardest, honestly, one of the hardest things ever.

1626
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,490
Because I'm like, what the fuck do people want?

1627
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:18,970
Like, I was just like, what the fuck do people want?

1628
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,290
What do you want?

1629
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:22,370
So I had like an huge list of things.

1630
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:27,650
Anyway, after I introduce all the auction items, I'll talk about the stretch goals.

1631
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:30,990
Which we've practically mostly hit already.

1632
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:40,470
Like, we're already mostly there on the ones that are officially on the stretch goals.

1633
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:41,050
Anyway.

1634
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:46,950
Um, the next item, it is not a physical item.

1635
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:52,290
It is pick the next official Doki outfit.

1636
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:59,930
So what that means is that you get to, you get to help pick, decide the theme and help design.

1637
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,890
Like, and give your input.

1638
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:10,850
Uh, give your input on, on, um, on what my next official outfit is going to be.

1639
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:16,550
The one after, you know, and the one after the, the, not this, not after this, but like after the other one.

1640
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:28,150
So, um, so obviously it has to be within TOS YouTube Twitch friendly for streaming.

1641
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,910
So I can actually wear it.

1642
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:30,730
I can actually wear it on stream.

1643
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:47,510
So, so by winning this auction, you can be part of the process and part of like deciding, like, you know, we'll be sending you like artwork, concept art, and you have to decide, like pick between the concept art and give input on what you want included.

1644
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:53,890
And the concept art, obviously you're not going to be paying for the, the fucking outfit.

1645
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,690
I will be paying for the outfit.

1646
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:57,870
So you don't have to worry about like paying for charity.

1647
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:01,370
And also the outfit itself, like the illustration for the outfit.

1648
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:02,470
Do not worry.

1649
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:07,370
I'll be paying for the skin suit being made like with the, the rigging and everything.

1650
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:08,850
Do not worry.

1651
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:16,490
I will be paying for the laundry of the skin suit and the, and the crafting of the skin suit.

1652
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,710
So you don't have to worry about that.

1653
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:21,250
Um, you get to be part of the process.

1654
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:23,670
Uh, so you, so that is okay.

1655
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,690
That's, so that's all that you have.

1656
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,610
You don't have to pay after the auction.

1657
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:33,990
Um, next item on the list is a...

1658
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:37,190
Okay, let me put it up on the screen.

1659
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:40,530
Let me see if I can find the right, the right picture.

1660
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:44,770
So the next item, um, it's not this piece of paper.

1661
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:45,630
It's a concept art.

1662
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:53,530
The next item is a dragoon wood carving.

1663
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:57,590
This is the concept art of the wood carving.

1664
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:58,630
It's self.

1665
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:06,950
Um, so they have, they've actually sent in, um, multiple like, uh, stuff they've done in the past.

1666
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:12,790
So here is like something they've, oh my God, this fucking picture is giant, enormous.

1667
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:16,970
Um, so this is like a proof of, uh, something they've actually done before.

1668
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:19,310
And it's, it's made of trees.

1669
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,730
So it's almost like paper.

1670
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:21,570
It's the same material.

1671
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,570
It's the same fucking material.

1672
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:24,470
.

1673
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:28,610
So this is like one of the things they've done in the past.

1674
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:32,010
So it's a full, uh, wood carving that they've carved themselves.

1675
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:36,350
But, um, instead of that, you would get a dragoon.

1676
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:37,650
You will get dragoon.

1677
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,170
And you can choose between different dragoon types.

1678
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:43,030
Like, you know, someone, you can add an egg at the bottom too.

1679
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:45,550
Like, you can add an egg in the bottom.

1680
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:48,870
Like I said, concept art is subjected to change.

1681
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:54,090
And, um, it is by, uh, Chen.

1682
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:55,070
I'm sorry.

1683
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,490
Chen09 is the artist.

1684
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:04,750
I have to like look at it for a second and be like, how do I pronounce it?

1685
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:05,370
Chen?

1686
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:07,170
Because there's a one.

1687
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:19,310
So, so, um, so this is the next item.

1688
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:20,010
Okay.

And I keep zazadonning.

1694
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:39,790
I'm supposed to, we have not got to any part of the auction.

1695
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:43,390
Like, we're still stuck in the auction part of it.

1696
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:47,550
I apologize.

1697
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:50,970

I hope you're still entertained.

1700
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:03,770
I hope you're still entertained while we're still on the auction.

1701
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:09,810
It's not stalling.

1702
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:12,090
I'm literally introducing the items.

1703
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:15,390
I like how someone's like, stop apologizing.

1704
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:17,110
Explain faster.

1705
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:19,610
Stop apologizing.

Okay, whoa.

1713
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,950
This is a giant...

1714
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:34,970
Oh my god, that's a big ass tomato.

1715
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:37,910
Okay.

1716
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:40,490

1717
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,010
Next item.

01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:45,830
It is another signed print.

1719
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:49,410
This is a work in progress.

1720
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,290
It is by...

1721
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:54,270

And like I said, this is a...

1723
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:03,690
This is going to be a signed print sent by me.

1724
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:06,170
Drawn by this illustrator.

1725
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:08,870
Look at all these fucking tomatoes.

1726
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:09,870
Who the fuck are they?

1727
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:14,010
And why are they not eaten yet?

1728
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:15,410
I can't believe it.

1729
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:16,990
Who let these guys out their cage?

1730
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,790
Who let them out?

1731
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:22,250
Who let them out?

1732
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,230
It's not dinner time yet.

1733
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:24,110
All right.

1734
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:26,070
And anyway, this is one of the...

1735
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:26,950
Another signed print.

1736
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:30,030
Another signed print that you can win.

1737
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:33,330
Next up is also another signed print.

1738
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:35,990
If I can find it.

1739
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:37,550
Oh my gosh.

1740
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:40,350
It is landscape style this time.

1741
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:42,610
All right.

1742
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:48,010
This one is by Shows140.

1743
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:51,910
This is going to be another signed print.

1744
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:54,510
Obviously, this is a concept art.

1745
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:56,010
So it will be...

1746
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:56,690
Oh my God.

1747
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,370
We're at fucking 50k already?

1748
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:00,770
Oh...

1749
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:03,290
Okay, let me...

1750
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,430
All right, guys.

1751
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:05,590
All right.

1752
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,050
You know what?

1753
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:08,710
All right.

1754
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:10,110
The next stretch goes...

1755
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:12,050
I'm just going to let you guys pick on the list.

1756
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:13,030
Because like...

1757
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:14,590
I can't...

1758
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:17,910
I have a giant list of like...

1759
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:19,330
What to do afterwards.

1760
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:21,890
So you guys can pick on the list afterwards.

1761
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:23,570
After each goal we hit.

1762
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:24,470
Let me...

1763
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,910
All right.

1764
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:25,130
Sorry.

1765
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:25,890
A little intermission.

1766
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:27,290
We got to fix this now.

1767
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:28,630
Because we made it past...

1768
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:29,670
Holy fuck.

1769
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:32,150
We already made it past 50k.

1770
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:35,210
Oh my God.

1771
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:36,430
Thank you, everybody.

1772
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:38,250
This is...

1773
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,830
Oh my God.

1774
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:40,630
This is...

1775
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:47,590
I can't believe we already made it past 50k.

1776
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:48,350
That's...

1777
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:49,510
Oh my God, guys.

1778
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:51,870
Oh my God.

1779
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:53,010
I'm so...

1780
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:54,110
That's actually crazy.

1781
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:57,310
Oh my God.

1782
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,030
It's only been an hour.

1783
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:00,630
We raised so much.

1784
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:03,410
I mean, if we count the charity...

1785
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:04,290
We've made like...

1786
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:05,470
If we count the auction...

1787
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:10,070
And the fundraising from like the one on the YouTube waiting room.

1788
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:11,070
This...

1789
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:11,530
It's like...

1790
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,010
We've like raised like...

1791
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:19,270
We've raised like 150,000 dollars technically.

1792
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:20,590
If you think about it.

1793
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:23,350
Because we also have the one from the YouTube charity.

1794
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,310
And then the auction itself.

1795
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:28,150
So we've already made 150k.

1796
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:29,410
Thousand.

1797
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:30,610
That's a lot of money.

1798
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:32,010
That's...

1799
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:33,410
Oh my God.

1800
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:34,970
That's just insane.

1801
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:36,170
Oh my God.

1802
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:37,510
All right.

1803
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:39,690
Let me put like the...

1804
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:40,170
Okay.

1805
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:40,990
Where the fuck...

1806
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:42,150
Incentives.

1807
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:42,570
Okay.

1808
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:43,530
Milestone.

1809
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:44,610
All right.

1815
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:51,150
I don't know.

1816
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:51,190
I don't know.

1817
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:53,670
Um, chat chooses from list.

1818
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:55,330
I'm sorry.

1819
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:59,130
All of this is just going to be chat chooses from list.

1820
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:01,350
Chat chooses from list.

1821
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:01,910
Okay.

1822
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:02,130
Wait.

1823
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:03,510
Not visage.

1824
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,370
All right.

1825
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:09,190
You guys want to know when we hit visage?

1826
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,630
When you guys get visage?

1827
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:11,050
Okay.

1828
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:11,850
I'll let you know.

1829
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,930
You guys get visage...

1830
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:15,010
Okay.

1831
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,170
400,000 dollars.

1832
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:18,570
You know what?

1833
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:19,690
Okay, you guys wanna know?

1834
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:20,590
Alright, here.

1835
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:23,350
This is the only way you'll get Visage to completion.

1836
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:29,190
This is the only way you'll ever get Visage.

1837
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:36,510
For those who keep demanding Visage.

1838
01:22:37,630 --> 01:22:40,050
Visage to end of story.

1839
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:41,890
$400,000.

1840
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,590
That's fucking right.

1841
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:58,790
It's like 60k chat chooses from list, not Visage.

1842
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,090
400k to leave Visage.

1843
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,570
It's not a scam!

1844
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:10,310
How is this a scam?

1845
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:13,390
You cannot say a charity is a scam.

1846
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,110
You cannot say that.

1847
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:24,390
You cannot say charity, that's fucked up.

1848
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:29,630
Hey, don't worry.

1849
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:32,190
I do have other reasonable goals.

1850
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:41,190
I will play Elden Ring for one stream.

1851
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,670
See, this is reasonable.

1852
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:47,650
Guys.

1853
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:49,830
That's so fucking reasonable.

01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:52,490
I will play Elden Ring for one stream.

1855
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:55,810

1856
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,570
If you want me to finish it.

1857
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:04,750
That's 400k.

1858
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:05,850
That's 500k.

1859
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:08,710

01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:14,330
Okay, I'll play Elden Ring for one stream.

Okay, I'll kill two bosses.

1863
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:19,670

01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:21,230
And kill two boss...

1865
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:21,630

1870
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,310
I'll kill me right BOS.

1871
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,030
Because like I ran out of space.

1872
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:38,110
So...

1873
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:43,290
I ran out of space.

1874
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:45,010
So it's just BOS.

1875
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,490
Sorry, look.

1876
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:48,790
I'm character limitations.

1877
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:51,110
Character limitations is hard.

1878
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:51,890
Okay.

1879
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:52,530

These are like the main goals to strive for.

1895
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:23,270
These are like the main goals to strive for.

1896
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:24,470
Like the main ones.

1897
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:28,070
It's not an ad.

1898
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:31,650
I'm actually trying to figure out the stretch goals right now.

1899
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:31,790

1913
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:56,230
This has been a long ad.

We have like the general ones yet now.

1915
01:25:58,890 --> 01:26:01,910
We have like the general idea of what we want for now.

1916
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:08,390
Alright.

1917
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,830
Anyway.

1918
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,870
Where was I on this long ad campaign?

1919
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:12,730
Alright.

1920
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:13,070
Okay.

1922
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:18,130
Look, we still have fucking 16 more items to go through.

Next up!

1924
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:21,350
This is so cute.

1925
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:23,650
I actually own a clay puff figure.

1926
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:24,590
A long...

1927
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:26,630
That was made like 3 years ago.

1928
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:27,650
3-4 years ago.

1929
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:31,970
Obviously, you know, the one I own was like 3-4 years ago.

1930
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:32,910
Clay puff figure.

1931
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:35,210
And now she's like even better!

1932
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:36,690
They're like a better...

1933
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:40,530
You know, they have 3-4 years of experience now.

1934
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:44,710
And this is a figure.

1935
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:46,750
Me being E.P.

1936
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:48,170
And this is the...

1937
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,850
I think like the base of it.

1938
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:51,790
On the end.

1939
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:55,130
But yeah, it's so fucking cute!

1940
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:56,570
This is by Clay Puff!

1941
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:57,910
Uh...

1942
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:00,370
Uh...

1943
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:02,810
And honestly, it's made of polymer clay.

1944
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:04,010
And acrylic.

1945
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:06,610
So it's a Doki themed standee!

1946
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:08,930
So it'll just be there.

1947
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:10,830
It'll just be like looking at you.

1948
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:11,770

01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,290

1950
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:14,510
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

1960
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:34,010
Well, not right away, but like...

1963
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:43,970
Um...

01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:53,990
This one will be...

1969
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:56,290
I think you guys would really like.

1970
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,490
This is a...

1971
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,810
The next one is...

1972
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:03,050
Another sculpture.

1973
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:04,910
Let me see if I can...

1974
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:07,010
If I can pull it up.

1975
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:09,190
So, I will give you guys...

1976
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:11,470
What they've done in the past.

1977
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:12,630
So...

1978
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:15,530
They have sculpted this...

1979
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:16,570
In the past.

1980
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,710
This is going...

1981
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,030
This is from Juicy Buns.

1982
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:22,890
And this is like...

1983
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:24,810
This is a...

1984
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:27,230
One of the works they've done in the past.

1985
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:28,850
And basically...

1986
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:29,770
That's not me.

1987
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:35,050
But they will make a version that's me.

1988
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:37,470
Just so you guys know.

1989
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:38,970
I know that's not me.

1990
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:39,930
This is a sample.

1991
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:43,290
But the actual sculpture will look like this.

1992
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:47,170
Just so you guys know.

1993
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:48,990
The actual sculpture.

1994
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,150
That's not you!

1995
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:54,270
This is what the actual sculpture...

1996
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:55,390
It's gonna be.

1997
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:56,810
It is gonna be a...

1998
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:58,270
High quality resin.

1999
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:01,010
And it will be sent...

2000
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:02,190
To Japan.

2001
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:04,850
To be professionally painted.

2002
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,330
And it's sent to you.

2003
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:08,430
So it's a...

2004
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:09,770
One of a kind.

2005
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:11,310
In public circulation.

2006
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:13,570
Disclaimer.

2007
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:14,550
In public circulation.

2008
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:16,590
A one of a kind.

2009
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:19,030
Basically...

2010
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:19,890
Resin figure.

2011
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:21,610
That is professionally painted.

2012
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:24,750
By a painter in Japan.

2013
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:27,070
And...

2014
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:28,990
It will be sent out...

2015
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:30,810
By end of May.

2016
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:32,730
So...

2017
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:33,570
Holy shit!

2018
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:36,930
Okay, anyway.

2019
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:37,870
Anyway.

2020
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:41,690
I didn't even realize how many bids it has now.

2021
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:43,510
Oh my fucking god.

2022
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,090
Okay.

2023
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:48,190
Okay.

2024
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:48,650
Okay.

2025
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:49,150
Anyway.

2026
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:50,170
Anyway.

2027
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:53,990
It is at 6,300.

2028
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:55,150
At the moment.

2029
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:58,250
But I think it's actually really fucking cool.

2030
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,570
That it's actually gonna be sent to...

2031
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:02,210
To someone.

2032
01:30:02,350 --> 01:30:04,110
It's not like an unpainted resin figure.

2033
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:05,750
It's gonna be sent to...

2034
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:06,950
Somebody in Japan.

2035
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:09,230
To fully paint it out and everything.

2036
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:12,010
So it's like a professional figure in general.

2037
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:13,310
Like it's actually a figure.

2038
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:17,150
That's like the really cool thing about this.

2039
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:17,530
That's like the really cool thing about this.

2040
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:17,730

I will show you guys.

2057
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:49,790
Stuff they've done in the past.

2058

Well.

2061
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:57,030
This is not me.

2062
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:57,910
Laughing.

2063
01:30:58,390 --> 01:31:00,270

01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:01,130
Just so you guys know.

2066
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:01,870
This is not me.

2067
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:06,150
This is an example of what they've done in the past.

2068
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:06,970
So.

2069
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:08,570
Basically.

2070
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:10,790
It is a cut out art.

2071
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:13,230
In an acrylic block.

2072
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:15,410
So it will look like.

2073
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:16,390
Ummm.

2074
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:18,350
It will look like this.

2075
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:20,690
So it will be like in a professional block.

2076
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:22,110
Ummm.

2077
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:22,910

2080
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:29,770

2081
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,750
Laughing.

2082
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:33,550
This is by JQHN.

2083
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:35,130
Harold.

2084
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:36,710

2085
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,630

2086
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:39,990
I pronounced the name.

2087
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:42,410
It's JQHN.

2088
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:43,330
Which I assume.

2089
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:44,450
It's John.

2090
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:47,610
I assume it's John.

2091
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:49,450
But it's with a Q.

2092
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:50,450
Ummm.

2093
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:50,790
So.

2094
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:54,330
This is the concept art that they gave us.

2095
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:55,410
Ummm.

2096
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,270
Where is it?

2097
01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:01,290
So this is what the concept art would look like.

2098
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:02,550
Ummm.

2099
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:03,650
It's not this.

2100
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:04,570
This is a concept.

2101
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:05,970
Just so you guys know.

2102
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:08,910
This is not what's being sent to you.

2103
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,450
This is a concept art.

2104
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:13,030
This is not the $900 thing you're bidding on.

2105
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:13,630
Laughing.

2106
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:14,890

01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:22,790
So.

2110
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:26,010
And it will be in this acrylic block.

01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:27,130
Ummm.

2112
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:28,630
And this is from John.

2113
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:30,110

2114
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:31,950
Well not just John.

2115
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:33,050
It's like John Harold.

2116
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:34,670
But like I'll just call him John.

2117
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:35,850
Laughing.

2118
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:36,150

01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,130
It's so cute.

2127
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:52,410

Here you go.

2150
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,840
This is some of the stuff they've done in the past.

2151
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:34,860
Like their style.

2152

But instead of that bitch.

2161

I'm sorry she's not a bitch.

2162
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:51,600

Laughing.

2165
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,360
It's a term of endearment.

2166
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,740
It will look like this.

2167
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:00,640

It will.

2172
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:11,370
Look it's a term of endearment.

2173
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:12,390
If I call you a bitch.

2174
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:14,170
It's like a nice thing.

2175
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:14,730
Okay.

2176
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,470

This one I am actually really really excited about.

2209
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:12,330
I've talked about this before on stream.

2210
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:13,570
Um.

2211
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:16,090
But I'll be giving you guys a sample of what they've done.

2212
01:35:16,270 --> 01:35:17,190
Like this is not.

2213
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:20,050
This is not the one that's being auctioned off.

2214
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:22,410
But it's a sample of what they've done in the past.

2215
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:23,270
So.

2216
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:25,430

Alright.

2219
01:35:28,350 --> 01:35:30,030

2223
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:35,610
It will.

2224
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:37,150
That's not the one that's being sold.

2225
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:37,910
It's gonna be of me.

2226
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:38,850
That's not me by the way.

2227
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:39,790
I don't know if you noticed.

2228
01:35:40,390 --> 01:35:40,870
Laughing.

2229
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,850
I know it's hard to tell.

2230
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:44,230
I know.

2231
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:46,070
It's almost the same.

2232
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:49,590
But this is by Dolls Jewel or like Moonlight Jewel.

2233
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:50,370
Um.

2234
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:52,130

And stuff like that.

2252
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:21,430

For myself.

2260
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:33,530
Like 5 years ago.

2261
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:34,870

Because you gotta know how to make clothes.

2280
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:04,570
You gotta know how to customize dolls in general.

2281

01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:11,670

I mean to paint the eyes is hard.

2313
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:56,530
You also have to deal with like.

2314
01:37:58,490 --> 01:37:58,950

01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:42,010
Just so you guys know.

2540
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,150

2550
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:57,810

01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:03,450
For Madoka.

2555
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:04,430

Rebellion?

2562
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:11,470
No not rebellion.

2563
01:44:11,770 --> 01:44:13,450
The one where they're in another city.

2564
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:14,430
And then there's like.

2565

And I apologize.

2579
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:40,030
To all the people that spent.

2580
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,330
Thousands of dollars on that gotcha game.

2581
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:43,970
Only for them to shut it down.

2582
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,050
This is why.

2583
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,950
You spend it on charity instead.

2584
01:44:52,770 --> 01:44:54,530
Not my Madoka.

2585
01:44:55,090 --> 01:44:55,610

01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:27,690
Monster.

2643
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:29,610
Of a tomato goon.

2644
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,070
Look at it.

2645
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,110
Hahahaha.

2646
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:35,370
He's like.

2647
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:36,410
He's like a shiny.

2648
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:38,430
But instead of a shiny variant.

2649
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:39,810
You're a tomato.

2650
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:42,670
The shiny variant of.

2651
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:44,070
Dragoons.

2652
01:46:44,110 --> 01:46:46,410
Is basically they're shaped like tomatoes.

2653
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:48,010
And they're very rare.

2654
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:49,810
Because majority of the time.

2655
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:51,730
When a tomato goon is born.

2656
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:53,710
They usually don't live past.

2657
01:46:55,230 --> 01:46:56,430
Past baby.

2658
01:46:57,010 --> 01:46:59,050
Because like usually all the dragoons.

2659
01:46:59,130 --> 01:46:59,830
Just eat it.

2660
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:00,850
Because it's a tomato.

2661
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:02,390
Or I eat it.

2662
01:47:02,470 --> 01:47:03,450
Because it's a tomato.

2663
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:07,330
So like if a tomato goon lives past.

2664
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:08,910
Baby mode.

2665
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:09,650
Um.

2666
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:11,850
Baby mode.

2667
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:12,750
They are like.

2668
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:14,030
They are very rare.

2669
01:47:14,110 --> 01:47:15,850
It's very very rare.

2670
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:16,790
Because they're like.

2671
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:18,470
They're so harvestable.

2672
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:19,110
Hahahaha.

2673
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:22,150
God.

2674
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:24,430
Look how harvestable you are.

2675
01:47:25,670 --> 01:47:26,270
Hahahaha.

2676
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:28,450
So.

2677
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:31,270
So it's very lucky.

2678
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:33,290
That they are able to.

2679
01:47:33,310 --> 01:47:34,710
Live past baby mode.

2680
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:35,290

They're like dodos.

2687
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:46,910
They're the dodos of the goons.

2688
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:47,670
Basically.

2689
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:49,070

01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:24,230
Plushie number 4.

2751
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:26,030
Alright.

2752
01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:26,510
Where is.

2753
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:31,370
Plushie number 4!

2754
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:33,310
Alright.

2755
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:34,590
This is another outfit.

2756
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:35,490
I feel like I have.

2757
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:38,970
I think all the plushies have like all my outfits in general.

2758
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:39,650
So.

2759
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:41,490
Plushie number 4.

2760
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:43,890
By Luna Noctu Arts.

2761
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:45,310
Um.

2762
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:47,170
Well known plushie artist.

2763
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:48,570
Within the Vtuber community.

2764
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:49,630
Uh.

2765
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:53,870
This is around 30 to 35 cm tall.

2766
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:54,690
Uh.

2767
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:56,350
This one is not done yet.

2768
01:49:56,510 --> 01:49:56,770
Obviously.

2769
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:57,790
But.

2770
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,730
Another plushie to look forward to.

2771
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:01,830
It's really.

2772
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:03,610
I think that's 30 to 35 cm.

2773
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:04,830
So that's pretty tall actually.

2774
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:07,310
But.

2775
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:10,330
They have made a lot of plushies.

2776
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:11,490
Within the Vtuber community.

2777
01:50:11,630 --> 01:50:13,750
So you might recognize the work they have done.

2778
01:50:14,730 --> 01:50:15,690
And yeah.

2779
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:16,150
This is another.

2780
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:18,770
I believe the hat is removable.

2781
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:19,170
Okay.

2782
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:20,230
Actually I shouldn't say it.

2783
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:27,110
I was just like.

2784
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:29,050
But it was never removable.

2785
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:30,270
What do you mean?

2786
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:36,350
I don't know if the hat is removable.

2787
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:37,010
Okay.

2788
01:50:37,190 --> 01:50:39,270
I don't know if the hat is removable.

2789
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:40,230
It could be.

2790
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:41,550
It could be.

2791
01:50:41,670 --> 01:50:42,930
But if it isn't.

2792
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,350
I won't force them to make it removable.

2793
01:50:46,010 --> 01:50:47,070
So it's like.

2794
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:48,870
Troll Ginger's hat.

2795
01:50:49,090 --> 01:50:51,290
Can it or can it not be removable?

2796
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:55,350
It is to be decided.

2797
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:56,670
I just add DLC.

2798
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:57,730
They are like.

2799
01:50:57,830 --> 01:50:58,270
Oh shit.

2800
01:50:58,350 --> 01:51:00,590
I have to redo the pattern now.

2801
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:04,970
You gotta buy it to find out.

2802
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:06,110
Exactly.

2803
01:51:06,970 --> 01:51:07,530
Exactly.

2804
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:09,450
If you really wanna know.

2805
01:51:09,530 --> 01:51:11,450
I guess you just have to buy it.

2806
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,170
I mean.

2807
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:17,550
I guess if that's what it takes.

2808
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:20,270
You just have to buy the hat to find out.

2809
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:23,250
Alright.

2810
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:25,410
Sorry I have to take a sip.

2811
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:27,570
Of my drink real fast.

2812
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:28,250
Alright.

2813
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:29,190
Next up.

2814
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:34,010
I think we have two more plushies left.

2815
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:35,690
And then also other stuff.

2816
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:37,510
The last two plushies.

2817
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:38,850
And then we have other things.

2818
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:41,470
It's not the last two items.

2819
01:51:41,590 --> 01:51:43,570
We have two more plushies left.

2820
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:44,370
Alright.

2821
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:49,610
This is Tiny Mii.

2822
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:53,070
Tiny Doki Plushy Kitchen.

2823
01:51:53,070 --> 01:51:53,230
Tiny Doki Plushy Kitchen.

2824
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:56,070
By Squeaky Neko.

2825
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:57,490
Yeah.

2826
01:51:57,570 --> 01:51:58,810
The post intermission.

2827
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:00,390
Is just me sipping on some tea.

2828
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:04,430
It's 3.5 inches tall.

2829
01:52:05,790 --> 01:52:07,630
It's very fucking tiny.

2830
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:09,930
But it is a keychain.

2831
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:13,550
And it's honestly incredibly cute.

2832
01:52:14,150 --> 01:52:15,450
Like look at that.

2833
01:52:15,510 --> 01:52:15,950
It's the hat.

2834
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:16,650
Okay.

2835
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:17,470
This one.

2836
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:18,970
I can safely say.

2837
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:23,070
That the hat is definitely not removed.

2838
01:52:23,130 --> 01:52:23,230
It's not removed.

2839
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:30,310
Just so you guys know.

2840
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:31,910
This hat.

2841
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:35,210
Is definitely not removable.

2842
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:38,250
So it's not false advertisement.

2843
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:40,750
Because I know for sure.

2844
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:42,670
It's not removable.

2845
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:48,670
So.

2846
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:52,290
That's all I have to say.

2847
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:53,230
Okay.

2848
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:56,290
Doki Amber Doge is mad right now.

2849
01:52:56,810 --> 01:52:58,230
Let me in.

2850
01:52:58,510 --> 01:52:59,830
Let me in.

2851
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:00,810
Okay.

2852
01:53:00,970 --> 01:53:02,230
Where was I?

2853
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:05,710
The last plushy in the showcase.

2854
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:07,290
There's more guys.

2855
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:08,790
There's not the last item.

2856
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:10,130
There's a lot more.

2857
01:53:10,770 --> 01:53:13,130
There's four more items left.

2858
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:15,250
It is.

2859
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:16,590
A little dragon.

2860
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:19,970
This is by.

2861
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:21,630
Seracinia.

2862
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:23,010
This is.

2863
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:25,630
10 centimeters tall.

2864
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:26,370
I believe.

2865
01:53:27,630 --> 01:53:28,750
It comes with.

2866
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:30,250
The back side has a little.

2867
01:53:30,690 --> 01:53:31,890
It's so fucking cute.

2868
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:33,490
I can show you it's back.

2869
01:53:34,590 --> 01:53:36,110
This is what it looks like.

2870
01:53:36,230 --> 01:53:37,190
In the back.

2871
01:53:37,470 --> 01:53:40,230
You can see the little butt tail over there.

2872
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:42,150
And yeah.

2873
01:53:42,270 --> 01:53:44,450
You get to own a little tiny dragon.

2874
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:46,550
Look at him.

2875
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:47,810
You can fucking.

2876
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:50,230
Punch.

2877
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:54,030
I was like.

2878
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:54,630
Doki.

2879
01:53:54,810 --> 01:53:56,910
Don't say your intrusive thoughts.

2880
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:58,950
I know you want to.

2881
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:01,970
Don't say it.

2882
01:54:02,190 --> 01:54:02,870
Anyway.

2883
01:54:02,950 --> 01:54:03,910
You can.

2884
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:07,830
Throw it against the door.

2885
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:10,610
Look at him.

2886
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:11,330
He's so.

2887
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:12,990
Throwable.

2888
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:16,530
He's so.

2889
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:17,010
It's like.

2890
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:19,270
Okay I almost said.

2891
01:54:19,390 --> 01:54:20,910
Some South Park thing.

2892
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:25,350
You can.

2893
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:28,290
Kick the dragon.

2894
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:29,990
You know.

2895
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:32,330
Just like in South Park.

2896
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:33,710
You know.

2897
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:35,430
Back when like Playstation.

2898
01:54:36,130 --> 01:54:37,790
One is like.

2899
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:38,910
Super popular.

2900
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:42,510
I mean all the Playstation are super popular back in the day.

2901
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:43,370
But like.

2902
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:44,450
Um.

2903
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:46,870

2908
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:50,950
Okay.

2909
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:52,410
This is like my dad's thing.

2910
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:52,990
Cause he was.

2911
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,470
He is still a gamer.

2912
01:54:54,690 --> 01:54:57,070
Like he's literally playing Dying Light right now.

2913
01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:58,590
I think he's replaying Dying Light.

2914
01:54:58,590 --> 01:54:59,030
I don't know.

2915
01:54:59,250 --> 01:54:59,790
He's play.

2916
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:03,390
I'm pretty sure he's replaying one of the Dying Light games at the moment.

2917
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:03,870
Anyway.

2918
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:05,530
On the PS5.

2919
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:07,050
Anyway as I was saying.

2920
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:08,790

Back in the day.

2929
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:24,730
We don't buy games digitally.

2930
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:26,310
I know it's crazy.

2931
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:27,470
Hahahaha.

2932
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:29,170

2938
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:41,250
Back then valve.

2939
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:43,530
Used to make video games.

2940
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,450
Fucking I know.

2941
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:46,210
It's so crazy.

2942
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:48,950
Steam the creators of Steam.

2943
01:55:49,070 --> 01:55:51,430
Used to make video games.

2944
01:55:52,030 --> 01:55:52,470
Hahahaha.

2945
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:55,410
Anyway.

2946
01:55:56,310 --> 01:56:04,050
Anyway, so my dad... so like back then, like PlayStation 1 games, people don't put the games in the... in the...

2947
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:04,890
boxes.

2948
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:13,490
They put the... instead... instead they buy these like giant CD holder things.

2949
01:56:13,970 --> 01:56:20,150
They buy these giant CD holder like contain... not containers, but like those flippy things.

2950
01:56:20,150 --> 01:56:22,990
Um, the TF2 had updates insane.

2951
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:23,790
I know.

2952
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:27,390
So my dad, his PlayStation 1...

2953
01:56:28,030 --> 01:56:31,990
His PlayStation 1 like game... Yeah, CD wallets.

2954
01:56:31,990 --> 01:56:32,850
Is that what you call?

2955
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:34,270
Is that what you boomers call?

2956
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:34,690
Yes.

2957
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:35,930
CD wallets.

2958
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:37,130
So that, um...

2959
01:56:37,930 --> 01:56:41,050
I feel that our dad is my age!

2960
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:44,890
Don't think that!

2961
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:51,640
Don't think that or I'll tell you how old PlayStation... did you guys know?

2962
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:56,320
Guys that the PlayStation... okay, when did the PlayStation 1 come up?

2963
01:56:56,500 --> 01:57:00,820
The PlayStation 1 came out in 1994.

2964
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:03,020
Holy shit!

2965
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:04,100
That's like...

2966
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:06,100
Hell yeah.

2967
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:06,900
Uh...

2968
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:11,320
That's like 30 years ago!

2969
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:12,300
Holy fuck!

2970
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:13,860
Okay, I had to think.

2971
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:17,440
That was 30 years ago!

2972
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:19,040
Oh my... okay.

2973
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:20,220
Alright, anyway.

2974
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:21,160
Anyway.

2975
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:30,100
Anyway, so my dad, my dad's CD wallet was actually the South Park's kick the baby thing.

2976
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:35,440
So like, I was... I would... when I would play around... like...

2977
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:40,420
The thing is, my entertainment... um... my entertainment...

2978
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:46,120
When I was like, you know, a fucking baby... was like...

2979
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:49,500
Was like playing with the CD wallet.

2980
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:50,400
Hahaha!

2981
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:52,300
Hahaha!

2982
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:56,760
I would be like... I would be playing on the PlayStation.

2983
01:57:57,340 --> 01:58:01,380
Because it was like, they kick the baby, and you got... you squished the baby around...

2984
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:05,100
in this like, liquid con... like, things in the front, and then my eyes were like...

2985
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:07,880
Like, oh my god, this is like, so fun.

2986
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,880
I wouldn't play the actual PlayStation 1 games... in the day.

2987
01:58:18,020 --> 01:58:21,780
I would just play with the CD wallet, I've kicked the baby, like it was... it...

2988
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:28,900
It was like a fucking core memory of mine of me just squishing a baby around.

2989
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:39,340
Anyway, next item on the list.

2990
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:43,580
Sorry for this random ad there for all of you guys.

2991
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:47,020
The next item, it is...

2992
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:53,800
A Doki themed necklace!

2993
01:58:54,740 --> 01:58:55,300
Alright.

2994
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:00,720
This is a concept art, but it is also made of sterling silver.

2995
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:05,960
This is a Doki themed necklace.

2996
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:07,560
So it has...

2997
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:14,160
Obviously it's like in my colors with the gems and everything as well as like the design as well.

2998
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:17,100
I remember I picked the con- they gave me several designs.

2999
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:21,220
And I feel like this was the one that best represented...

3000
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:22,120
Me.

3001
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,660
And it is by Illycia.

3002
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:26,060
So really beautiful necklace.

3003
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:28,120
I really love like...

3004
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,920
I really love like the design concept in general.

3005
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:31,500
They're amazing.

3006
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:32,520
A jewelry designer.

3007
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,620
And it's really pretty.

3008
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,680
It's inc- it's gorgeous honestly.

3009
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:41,480
Like honestly, there's not a lot for me to say, because it's just a really beautiful piece.

3010
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:45,660
And like I said, it is one of a kind in public circulation.

3011
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:50,360
I hate that I can't say one of a kind anymore!

3012
01:59:57,680 --> 02:00:00,360
Not allowed to say one of a kind!

3013
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:07,760
Anyway... anyway... alright... what is next?

3014
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,920
Ooh, we are three more to go!

3015
02:00:10,220 --> 02:00:12,140
Three more to go!

3016
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:17,140
Where is this one?

3017
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:19,780
Where the fuck did I put the concept for this?

3018
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:22,260
Uhhh... okay, here we go.

3019
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:25,540
I think it is... this.

3020
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:26,600
Alright!

3021
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:33,660
This is a Doki themed pyrography linking wood.

3022
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:36,920
So for those who don't... this is by Wyrmwood Pyro.

3023
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:44,440
So for those who don't know what pyrography is, it's basically like flame torched art.

3024
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:48,560
Which is crazy to think about.

3025
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:54,680
So, if you look at their portfolio, I believe my mod...

3026
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,960
Yeah, my mod has linked their portfolio.

3027
02:00:57,240 --> 02:01:00,180
And you see what they've done in the past and everything.

3028
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:03,900
So they're using fire to create art.

3029
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:07,540
So they draw it on the wood with fire.

3030
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:11,020
And it's actually... their portfolio is insane.

3031
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:13,900
It's actually very, very interesting to look at.

3032
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:16,900
But very gorgeous artwork.

3033
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:19,840
Indeed, obviously, it's concept art.

3034
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:22,100
But I'm pretty sure it's going to turn out amazing.

3035
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:24,600
But yes, it is like wood burning type deal.

3036
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:27,320
So that is...

3037
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:29,020
Okay, last two guys!

3038
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:30,820
We're in the final stretch!

3039
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:33,280
Our two hour ad is almost done!

3040
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:37,880
Our two hour ad is almost done!

3041
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:41,680
Then we can go to the stretch goals for another ad break!

3042
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:44,740
For a different type of ad.

3043
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:45,740
Alright!

3044
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:48,440
Next up!

3045
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:51,900
Two Doki Bird signed prints!

3046
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:55,080
Almost hot sauce time!

3047
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:56,620
We're almost there!

3048
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:57,580
Hot sauce!

3049
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:00,140
Okay, alright.

3050
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:04,400
This is two Doki Bird prints.

3051
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:07,620
And this artist is...

3052
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:08,540
Ba-bam!

3053
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:12,200
This is by Hiso-mean?

3054
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:13,020
Hiso-mean?

3055
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:14,200
Um...

3056
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:18,460
It's two signed Doki Bird prints.

3057
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:20,920
Beautiful artwork, okay?

3058
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:22,620
Honestly, gorgeous artwork.

3059
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:25,400
And they actually gave me two work in progress.

3060
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:27,440
Like I said, this is just a draft.

3061
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:28,800
Obviously, it would...

3062
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,760
There would be...

3063
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,800
It's going to be refined a bit more later.

3064
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:34,220
But here is their other...

3065
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:34,960
Uh...

3066
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:38,300
This is their other print that would be sent to you guys.

3067
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:39,460
So this is the...

3068
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:41,560
The two prints that would be there.

3069
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:42,760
Yeah, this is the draft.

3070
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:46,340
It's just a rough draft of the illustration.

3071
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:47,460
Um...

3072
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:49,160
And it will be signed by me.

3073
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:50,320
I will not...

3074
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:50,680
Okay!

3075
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:51,500
Alright.

3076
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:53,840
If this print...

3077
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,820
If the auction for this goes to 2000...

3078
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:57,900
Actually, I don't...

3079
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:59,880
I feel like you guys would be like, No, don't cover the belly.

3080
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:03,700
It's going to be like, I will sign my name on the belly.

3081
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:06,840
But then I feel like you guys would be like, No, you ruined it!

3082
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:07,400
Okay.

3083
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:09,600
If it gets to 2K...

3084
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:10,660
I will...

3085
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:12,600
I will let you choose where I sign...

3086
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:14,980
I will sign my signature.

3087
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:21,420
I don't know.

3088
02:03:21,420 --> 02:03:23,780
Maybe you would want me to sign on the...

3089
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:26,000
Do not ruin the stomach.

3090
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,420
Don't cover the belly!

3091
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:33,500
No!

3092
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:38,900
If it gets to 2K...

3093
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:41,660
I will let you pick where I sign...

3094
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:42,880
Or I don't know...

3095
02:03:43,180 --> 02:03:47,240
Well, it would be a shame if my hand gets there.

3096
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:52,080
Okay.

3097
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:54,360
Anyway.

3098
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,620
Anyway, we will...

3099
02:03:56,620 --> 02:03:56,820
Okay.

3100
02:03:56,860 --> 02:03:57,700
Last item.

3101
02:03:58,360 --> 02:03:59,800
The last...

3102
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:01,660
The last item...

3103
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:03,340
That's kind of evil.

3104
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:04,080
Hey!

3105
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:04,640
Hey!

3106
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:06,060
It's charity.

3107
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:08,220
It's charity.

3108
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:09,460
Okay.

3109
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:10,560
Oh, yeah.

3110
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:11,720
Oh, yeah.

3111
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:12,000
Okay.

3112
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:13,040
Last item.

3113
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:13,480
Finally!

3114
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:15,440
The last item...

3115
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:21,580
Is a custom wood keyboard.

3116
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:24,940
It comes with the key caps.

3117
02:04:25,420 --> 02:04:26,220
Yes.

3118
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:28,860
It comes with the key caps.

3119
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:30,800
So, it is a...

3120
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:35,380
It has a dragoon printed on the keyboard itself.

3121
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:38,960
You will see in the back as well...

3122
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:43,640
There is a little dragoon in the back.

3123
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:44,760
Oh, he's doing okay.

3124
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:45,220
He's...

3125
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:49,920
He's okay.

3126
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:52,540
He's currently the top bidder and no one's sniping him yet.

3127
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:53,200
So he's fine.

3128
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:57,600
I say yet because he still has like 22 hours.

3129
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:04,040
Someone in Asia might come over and be like, I'm sorry.

3130
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:17,640
So basically it is a full wooden keyboard with dragoon prints on it.

3131
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:20,220
And it comes with the keycaps.

3132
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,040
34 minutes ago.

3133
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:23,540
He's doing fine for now.

3134
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:25,380
Yeah, he's doing okay, guys.

3135
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:26,500
Nothing to worry about.

3136
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:28,980
He is doing a-okay.

3137
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:37,160
He just has to make sure nobody on the other side of the world wakes up and was like, ooh.

3138
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:44,240
That's all you have to worry about at the moment.

3139
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:45,120
All right.

3140
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:46,480
Holy fuck.

3141
02:05:46,660 --> 02:05:47,220
Okay.

3142
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:49,420
We took this a while.

3143
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:55,800
But we finished introducing every single item that is in the auction.

3144
02:05:56,720 --> 02:06:01,020
Like I said, a huge thank you to...

3145
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:02,960
It's not hot sauce time.

3146
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:03,980
We go by order.

3147
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:08,120
We go by order of the goals, guys.

3148
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:08,780
It's not.

3149
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:09,940
Hot sauce time.

3150
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:12,120
We still have to do this.

3151
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:14,260
We have to figure out the rest of the stretch goals.

3152
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:16,540
And then we go by order.

3153
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:17,300
Okay.

3154
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:18,480
Time for the next ad.

3155
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:19,340
Okay.

3156
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:21,760
Time for the next ad break.

3157
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:24,760
Let's have a little intermission first.

3158
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,320
Let me drink my fucking tea.

3159
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:30,940
Okay.

3160
02:06:31,820 --> 02:06:33,740
As I was saying.

3161
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:34,840
As I was saying.

3162
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:39,720
I want to say, like I said, a huge thank you and a huge shout out.

3163
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:41,180
To all the amateurs.

3164
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:43,720
To all the amazing creators that are part of this auction.

3165
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:47,700
We couldn't have done it without everybody that applied.

3166
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:49,320
Thank you to everyone that applied.

3167
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:51,880
I'm really sorry if you didn't make it to the auction.

3168
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:58,380
If you weren't able to be part of the final round that we chose for it.

3169
02:06:58,580 --> 02:06:59,800
Maybe in the future.

3170
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,280
Because definitely, obviously I won't do these types of auctions very frequently.

3171
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:08,060
Like, you know, it's going to lose their spark and their appeal for charity.

3172
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:11,180
But maybe it'll be something I can do.

3173
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:13,080
And I'll do again, maybe next year.

3174
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:20,100
Because it was a great pleasure to work with lots of amazing creators.

3175
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:24,160
To create these one-of-a-kind Doki Bird items.

3176
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:30,780
So, good luck to everybody who wins it.

3177
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:34,320
It is very competitive as we've seen.

3178
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:37,660
Like, just from the first two hours.

3179
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:39,360
We have...

3180
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,380
We have reached, like, what?

3181
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:44,760
$60,000?

3182
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:47,700
I'm pretty sure more than $60,000.

3183
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:49,740
Like, if anybody has kept...

3184
02:07:50,250 --> 02:07:52,940
That anyone kept count of, like, how...

3185
02:07:53,310 --> 02:07:54,260
How much...

3186
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:55,200
So, well, nice.

3187
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:56,660
$69,000.

3188
02:07:56,700 --> 02:08:02,480
We've, like, almost made $70,000 from just the...

3189
02:08:03,230 --> 02:08:05,160
From just the auction alone.

3190
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:06,240
So...

3191
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:08,400
And it's just the first two hours, too.

3192
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:10,860
It's just the first two hours of the auction.

3193
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:20,680
So, like I said, it's absolutely fucking crazy that we've came this far.

3194
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:21,400
Alright!

3195
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:24,940
It's time to add the stretch goal!

3196
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:27,720
Alright, alright!

3197
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:28,760
Alright, guys.

3198
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:32,900
I will finally look at the stretch goal.

3199
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:39,060
We have to figure out the rest of the goals now.

3200
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:41,780
We have to figure out the rest of this.

3201
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:42,560
Okay!

3202
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:44,280
Alright, let's see.

3203
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:46,840
Okay, $50,000 and $60,000.

3204
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:48,820
Okay, let me bring up my list.

3205
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:49,680
Alright, guys.

3206
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:51,700
This is a list we made in the...

3207
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:53,240
During the members.

3208
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:56,240
So, you can blame the member goons if you think it's a...

3209
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:57,820
If you think the list should be better.

3210
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:58,340
Yeah!

3211
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,340
You can blame it on...

3212
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:04,840
They brainstormed this.

3213
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,720
They brainstormed this, okay?

3214
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:09,640
You can blame them if you think, like, it could be better.

3215
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:14,260
I'm trying to find...

3216
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:15,240
What do you mean, stop, stop?

3217
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:18,060
I'm, like, deleting stuff to see the ones I've already put.

3218
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:19,000
Okay.

3219
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:21,100
Alright, let's see.

3220
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:22,680
Okay.

3221
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:24,540
Let's see.

3222
02:09:25,820 --> 02:09:27,120
We've done that already.

3223
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:28,700
We've put that in.

3224
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:32,140
I've put that in.

3225
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:32,900
Alright.

3226
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:34,220
Okay.

3227
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:36,760
This is not a lot on the list, I've realized.

3228
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:37,140
Because...

3229
02:09:40,580 --> 02:09:41,540
I just...

3230
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,440
I've realized...

3231
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:43,460
I've realized...

3232
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:46,500
I've already inserted majority of the...

3233
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:46,740
Yeah.

3234
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:48,160
Okay, we're gonna...

3235
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:52,320
We're gonna come up with new things for the stretch goals, okay?

3236
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:57,900
We're gonna come up with more things on the stretch goals, okay, guys?

3237
02:09:58,400 --> 02:09:59,800
Because I already, like...

3238
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:01,560
Alright, here is what I have left.

3239
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:02,660
Okay.

3240
02:10:07,940 --> 02:10:08,920
This is...

3241
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:11,100
This is all I have left.

3242
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,280
We're on the list we have.

3243
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,960
After deleting everything.

3244
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:17,700
Because all the other stuff is already on.

3245
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:23,180
All the other stuff is already on the fucking stretch goals.

3246
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:24,240
So it's not my fault.

3247
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:25,600
It's not my fault.

3248
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:27,920
Alright.

3249
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:30,660
I see a lot of Mr. Mad.

3250
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,400
Look, I didn't ask him to.

3251
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:33,280
But, like, I...

3252
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:35,320
He's literally on my payroll.

3253
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:36,920
So, like...

3254
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:38,280
Like...

3255
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:39,260
I...

3256
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:39,740
He's...

3257
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:40,960
I literally pay him...

3258
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:41,560
To do stuff.

3259
02:10:41,860 --> 02:10:42,500
So...

3260
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:43,760
So, like...

3261
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:45,140
I know I didn't ask...

3262
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,760
For his permission.

3263
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:53,680
I...

3264
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:56,660
I didn't...

3265
02:10:56,660 --> 02:10:59,520
I didn't ask for his permission to be put...

3266
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:00,480
Used as the...

3267
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,500
But it's for charity, though.

3268
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:04,000
It's for charity.

3269
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:05,480
So...

3270
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,600
Doki, do not...

3271
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,300
What I'm saying...

3272
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:13,360
All it is...

3273
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:14,280
It is for charity.

3274
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:18,580
Look...

3275
02:11:18,580 --> 02:11:26,760
As a great boss, I am going to volunteer my manager to do an ASMR...

3276
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:28,320
Okay, okay.

3277
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:29,020
I'll message it.

3278
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:35,980
Hey, are you down to do an ASMR stream on my channel for charity?

3279
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:39,760
For charity?

3280
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:40,180
Okay.

3281
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:40,720
I'm going to...

3282
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:40,840
I'm going to...

3283
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:42,000
Alright.

3284
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:42,600
Look...

3285
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:42,880
See?

3286
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:44,620
I asked him.

3287
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:47,000
And it was very nicely asked, too.

3288
02:11:47,100 --> 02:11:53,340
I was like, hey, are you down to do an ASMR stream on my channel for charity?

3289
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:55,920
And he can't pretend that he's not here.

3290
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:57,040
Because I...

3291
02:11:57,040 --> 02:12:01,580
I can literally see that he's listening to something on Spotify.

3292
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:06,900
I know whenever Mr. Man is online...

3293
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:10,820
Because he would listen to something on Spotify.

3294
02:12:10,820 --> 02:12:13,160
And I would be like, he's online.

3295
02:12:13,420 --> 02:12:14,340
So he can't pretend.

3296
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:15,020
Oh!

3297
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:16,740
He said yes!

3298
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:17,680
Alright.

3299
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:18,680
That's going to be...

3300
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:19,900
Alright.

3301
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:20,580
I'm putting that in.

3302
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:21,220
He said yes.

3303
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:22,040
Alright.

3304
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:24,940
I'm changing to 50k right now.

3305
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,980
50k is Mr. Man ASMR stream.

3306
02:12:29,560 --> 02:12:30,440
There you go.

3307
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:31,620
Alright.

3308
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,200
That's 50k.

3309
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:36,040
And then 60k would be...

3310
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:39,140
That is...

3311
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:40,800
I will get forklift service.

3312
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,740
I will get forklift certified.

3313
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:45,540
There you go.

3314
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:46,320
Alright.

3315
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:47,460
There you go.

3316
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:48,600
That is my 60k.

3317
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:50,440
And then we'll make one for...

3318
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:53,220
We'll make one for 80k.

3319
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:54,660
And then it jumps to 100k.

3320
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:56,860
Because I'm going to run out of stuff to give you guys.

3321
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:57,320
So...

3322
02:12:57,320 --> 02:12:58,920
What do you guys want for 80k?

3323
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:01,100
You guys can come up with new goals too.

3324
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:02,280
Because like...

3325
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:02,520
I'm...

3326
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:04,380
We've already fucking...

3327
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,320
Chose a lot of stuff.

3328
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:09,640
You guys want different things.

3329
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:11,580
We can also do that too.

3330
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:12,560
Alright.

3331
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:16,820
We already have the Doki Bird ASMR.

3332
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:19,360
We already have that.

3333
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:25,060
Alright.

3334
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:27,200
We already have the karaoke.

3335
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:28,020
It's on.

3336
02:13:28,180 --> 02:13:29,580
We already reached it guys.

3337
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:30,880
We already...

3338
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:33,340
We already reached it.

3339
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:36,440
Okay.

3340
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:37,180
I know...

3341
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:37,740
Alright.

3342
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:40,940
I can't say like 24 hour streams.

3343
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:43,360
Because like I know my fucking limits.

3344
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:45,860
And that is a hard limit.

3345
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:48,560
I cannot survive on 20...

3346
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:50,320
Streaming 24 hours.

3347
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,140
I actually like...

3348
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:53,440
I cannot do that.

3349
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:55,920
Like I remember trying to one time.

3350
02:13:56,180 --> 02:13:57,400
And it was like...

3351
02:13:57,400 --> 02:13:58,300
It was not good.

3352
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:00,360
It was not good.

3353
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:01,920
At all.

3354
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:03,140
Okay.

3355
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:04,900
Alright.

3356
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:06,880
At...

3357
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:07,400
Okay.

3358
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:07,620
Wait.

3359
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:08,000
Wait.

3360
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:08,460
Let me think.

3361
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:09,520
I'm trying to think.

3362
02:14:09,580 --> 02:14:10,600
12 hour stream?

3363
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:11,360
Okay.

3364
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:13,440
12 hour stream is like...

3365
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:14,100
That...

3366
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:17,000
Alright.

3367
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:17,860
I have an idea.

3368
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:19,280
I have an idea.

3369
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:20,140
Okay.

3370
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:22,020
At 80k.

3371
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,080
At 80k.

3372
02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:27,080
By...

3373
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:27,820
On...

3374
02:14:27,820 --> 02:14:28,520
What is it?

3375
02:14:30,340 --> 02:14:30,840
April.

3376
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:32,040
Okay.

3377
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:33,040
80k.

3378
02:14:33,940 --> 02:14:34,440
Wait.

3379
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:35,540
We already reached 80k.

3380
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:35,980
Never mind.

3381
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:36,920
Okay.

3382
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:37,380
80k.

3383
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:42,270
We are going to...

3384
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:43,210
My parent mom came in.

3385
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:44,110
She's like, we are going to leave now.

3386
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:44,810
And I was like, okay.

3387
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:45,510
Alright.

3388
02:14:46,450 --> 02:14:46,890
Uh...

3389
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:49,910
Guys.

3390
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:54,170
I'm not going to make my dad stream.

3391
02:14:54,650 --> 02:14:56,430
He doesn't know what's going on.

3392
02:15:01,070 --> 02:15:01,510
What?

3393
02:15:03,310 --> 02:15:03,670
Okay.

3394
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:04,370
Alright.

3395
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:05,710
Alright.

3396
02:15:05,910 --> 02:15:07,630
If you guys want...

3397
02:15:08,690 --> 02:15:09,130
Warrior...

3398
02:15:09,130 --> 02:15:09,570
Total.

3399
02:15:09,810 --> 02:15:10,590
For auction.

3400
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:11,130
Okay.

3401
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:12,570
What is the total?

3402
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:13,690
For...

3403
02:15:13,690 --> 02:15:14,830
Auction.

3404
02:15:15,330 --> 02:15:16,090
And...

3405
02:15:16,090 --> 02:15:16,650
Uh...

3406
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:17,410
And...

3407
02:15:17,410 --> 02:15:18,370
And this.

3408
02:15:18,610 --> 02:15:19,310
Guys.

3409
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:20,230
What is the total?

3410
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:22,070
What is...

3411
02:15:27,730 --> 02:15:29,770
It's 120k right now?

3412
02:15:29,950 --> 02:15:30,710
Okay.

3413
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:32,890
At 150k.

3414
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:34,610
I will convince...

3415
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:35,630
My dad...

3416
02:15:36,130 --> 02:15:36,870
To stream.

3417
02:15:41,210 --> 02:15:41,730
On...

3418
02:15:42,250 --> 02:15:44,030
On his PS5.

3419
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:46,410
I'll convince him.

3420
02:15:47,110 --> 02:15:51,970
I'll convince my dad to do a PS5 stream for you guys.

3421
02:15:52,250 --> 02:15:55,210
But it's going to be in Chinese.

3422
02:15:58,110 --> 02:15:59,150
No.

3423
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:00,870
Not...

3424
02:16:00,870 --> 02:16:02,690
Not Doki Amberdoge.

3425
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:03,470
Guys.

3426
02:16:03,810 --> 02:16:04,550
Okay.

3427
02:16:05,110 --> 02:16:09,710
My dad will stream on his PS5.

3428
02:16:09,710 --> 02:16:10,570
Okay.

3429
02:16:10,570 --> 02:16:11,370
Good for you.

3430
02:16:13,570 --> 02:16:14,750
My hu- Okay.

3431
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:16,290
Human Dad.

3432
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:20,970
I'll put that at 150,000.

3433
02:16:22,010 --> 02:16:22,650
Okay?

3434
02:16:24,230 --> 02:16:27,870
At 150,000, you will get that.

3435
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:30,150
You will get that.

3436
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:31,290
Where do you have it?

3437
02:16:31,370 --> 02:16:32,010
200k.

3438
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:34,530
200k is Pokemon Smash or Pass.

3439
02:16:35,130 --> 02:16:37,210
Because he doesn't fucking play on PC.

3440
02:16:37,330 --> 02:16:38,710
He plays on the PS5.

3441
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:47,310
He doesn't play PC games.

3442
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:49,150
He plays on his PS5.

3443
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:51,830
Guys, it's different.

3444
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:54,550
A cover with Ditto?

3445
02:16:54,830 --> 02:16:55,430
Okay.

3446
02:16:55,890 --> 02:16:57,350
We already had 80k.

3447
02:16:57,450 --> 02:16:57,790
Fuck it.

3448
02:16:57,830 --> 02:16:58,250
We'll do it.

3449
02:16:58,430 --> 02:16:59,410
Duet cover.

3450
02:16:59,910 --> 02:17:02,430
Duet cover with Ditto.

3451
02:17:03,450 --> 02:17:05,410
I didn't ask her, but she's totally down.

3452
02:17:14,150 --> 02:17:16,990
Because we wanted to do it for a while.

3453
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:22,110
We wanted to do it for a while.

3454
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:27,950
She's totally down, though.

3455
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:29,110
She's totally down.

3456
02:17:29,450 --> 02:17:32,030
It wasn't for charity.

3457
02:17:32,190 --> 02:17:33,250
She was...

3458
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:39,010
Oh yeah, by the way, Mr. Man is asking you guys, how does ASMR work?

3459
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:39,950
Does...

3460
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:41,710
Does... Should he buy the ears?

3461
02:17:42,070 --> 02:17:43,890
Do you think he should buy the...

3462
02:17:43,890 --> 02:17:45,890
Just the one-off?

3463
02:17:46,670 --> 02:17:48,470
The one-off?

3464
02:17:48,470 --> 02:17:53,390
He gets the fucking ear... the ear mics and stuff for the one-off?

3465
02:17:58,070 --> 02:18:02,550
The full set... Mr. Man manages you.

3466
02:18:03,690 --> 02:18:06,030
For your streaming career.

3467
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:08,890
Manager RP.

3468
02:18:10,230 --> 02:18:11,470
Oh my god.

3469
02:18:12,090 --> 02:18:12,710
2k!

3470
02:18:12,870 --> 02:18:17,410
Guys, I am not giving Mr. Man $2000 for this one stream.

3471
02:18:17,670 --> 02:18:19,030
There's no fucking way.

3472
02:18:19,290 --> 02:18:21,190
He's not even a streamer.

3473
02:18:21,230 --> 02:18:24,850
I am not giving Mr. Man $2000 for just one stream.

3474
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:30,110
Manager RP.

3475
02:18:34,810 --> 02:18:35,430
Okay.

3476
02:18:35,670 --> 02:18:36,270
Alright.

3477
02:18:36,390 --> 02:18:36,910
Oh shit, wait.

3478
02:18:37,070 --> 02:18:39,590
My graphic designer finished like a little...

3479
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:41,550

This is the hashtag.

3501
02:19:18,970 --> 02:19:20,890
For those who were confused...

3502
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:22,730
I wish I wanted to make sure it wasn't covering anything.

3503
02:19:23,130 --> 02:19:25,150
Sorry for the name on the side that I'm covering.

3509
02:19:35,090 --> 02:19:35,310
Okay.

Okay.

02:19:36,990 --> 02:19:37,930
We have...

3513
02:19:37,930 --> 02:19:39,910
Some of the stretch goals made.

3514
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:40,750
Is that enough?

3515
02:19:40,950 --> 02:19:41,750
Is that good enough?

3516
02:19:42,090 --> 02:19:46,430
Alright, we got 60k forklift certified duet cover with Ditto.

3517
02:19:46,590 --> 02:19:48,730

Alright.

3523
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:01,730
We are at 150k.

3524
02:20:02,010 --> 02:20:04,610
Because we're currently at 120k, right?

3525
02:20:05,770 --> 02:20:10,190
We are at 120k dollars raised.

3526
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:17,360
I don't know what else to do.

3527
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:18,700
What else do we do?

3528
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:19,900
Is there any other stuff?

3529
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:22,380
Is there any other stuff?

3530
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:25,160
Can we change the 100k probably?

3531
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:29,360
What are you...

3532
02:20:29,360 --> 02:20:30,560
You can't just be like...

3533
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:32,880
There's no backsies for this guys.

3534

There's no like...

3535
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:35,800
Backsies.

3536
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:37,760
Backsies.

3537
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,940
Can I change that please?

3538
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:42,640
Alright.

3539
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:44,120
At 250...

3540
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:46,100
Because we're already at 120k.

3541
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:46,320

3542
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:46,560
Okay.

02:21:00,060 --> 02:21:00,540

3561
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:08,000
Okay.

Alright.

3572
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:34,140
There you go.

3575
02:21:35,380 --> 02:21:35,440

3579
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:45,280
Let's all go through the stretch goals you've all accomplished.

3580
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:49,020
Chat picks Twitter profile picture for two weeks.

3581
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:49,960
Okay guys.

3582
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:51,300
I'm gonna tweet it out.

3583
02:21:52,020 --> 02:21:52,660
Um...

3584
02:21:52,660 --> 02:21:53,440
The one...

3585
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:53,700
The...

3586
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:55,620
The picture...

3587
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:57,520
That has the most likes...

3588
02:21:57,520 --> 02:21:59,480
Will be my Twitter pro...

3589
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:02,140
Within Twitter TOS by the way.

3590
02:22:02,260 --> 02:22:03,860
Because I know...

3591
02:22:03,860 --> 02:22:05,860
People in the past who've done this...

3592
02:22:05,860 --> 02:22:07,900
The people in the past who have done this...

3593
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:09,940
Actually got locked by Twitter.

3594
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:11,720
Because...

3595
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:13,200
The Twitter profile...

3596
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:14,880
Because they got reported...

3597
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,880
And people reported them...

3598
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:19,900
And they got locked out of their Twitter account.

3599
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:23,180
Because it was against terms of service.

3600
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:24,240
I know...

3601
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:25,680
Elon Musk...

3602
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,820
Owns Twitter now.

3603
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:29,760
And he's very relaxed about Twitter rules.

3604
02:22:30,100 --> 02:22:30,620
But...

3605
02:22:30,620 --> 02:22:31,340
Apparently...

3606
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:32,940
Twitter profile pictures...

3607
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:34,680
Are very strict.

3608
02:22:34,820 --> 02:22:36,460
For some fucking reason.

3609
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:39,040
Compared to the other stuff in the Twitter TOS.

3610
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:39,980
So...

3611
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:41,060
So...

3612
02:22:41,060 --> 02:22:42,100
So...

3613
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:43,080
I will...

3614
02:22:43,540 --> 02:22:44,880
Tweet it out right now.

3615
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:46,060
I'm gonna tweet it out.

3616
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:48,260
The picture...

3617
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:50,140
With the most likes...

3618
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:51,280
Um...

3619
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:51,700
Okay.

3620
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:52,780
How did I used to do it?

3621
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:53,360
Um...

3622
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:55,200
Reply...

3623
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:56,240
With...

3624
02:22:56,240 --> 02:22:57,420
A picture...

3625
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:59,220
For me to use...

3626
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:00,140
As a...

3627
02:23:00,140 --> 02:23:02,140
Profile picture...

3628
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:03,580
For two weeks.

3629
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:06,340
The one with the most likes...

3630
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:08,020
Becomes...

3631
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:10,300
My new profile picture.

3632
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:11,280
There we go.

3633
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:12,180
I'm gonna...

3634
02:23:12,180 --> 02:23:13,100
Tweet it out.

3635
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:14,140
And within...

3636
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:18,000
Doki Ambidoj.

3637
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:18,560
What is it?

3638
02:23:18,580 --> 02:23:19,260
I know there's chicken.

3639
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:20,020
I know.

3640
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:21,820
You can't have any.

3641
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:23,240
No.

3642
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:25,440
No.

3643
02:23:26,920 --> 02:23:27,560
No.

3644
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:29,460
That's fucking right.

3645
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:31,540
No.

3646
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:34,720
Okay.

3647
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:36,460
Okay.

3648
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:41,660
Reply with a picture for me to use as a profile picture for two weeks.

3649
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:43,760
The one with the most likes becomes my...

3650
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:46,640
The one with the most likes wins.

3651
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:47,320
Okay.

3652
02:23:47,860 --> 02:23:48,580
There we go.

3653
02:23:52,250 --> 02:23:52,730
Alright.

3654
02:23:52,770 --> 02:23:53,050
Here we go.

3655
02:23:53,110 --> 02:23:53,750
I'm gonna tweet it out.

3656
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:54,770
Good luck guys.

3657
02:24:00,750 --> 02:24:01,710
Good luck.

3658
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:03,870
May the best picture win.

3659
02:24:03,970 --> 02:24:04,070
I'm gonna...

3660
02:24:04,070 --> 02:24:05,850
Did people already have a picture?

3661
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:07,430
How do y'all have a pit...?

3662
02:24:07,430 --> 02:24:09,570
Who the fuck put a tomatoes ass?

3663

How the fuck do you already have a picture?

3664
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:16,930
All right.

3665
02:24:17,590 --> 02:24:18,590
Here's the tweet.

3666
02:24:19,490 --> 02:24:20,570
Go wild.

3667
02:24:20,890 --> 02:24:23,710
Go fucking wild with your...

3668
02:24:23,710 --> 02:24:24,830
With your ideas.

3669
02:24:25,430 --> 02:24:26,430
All right, all right.

3670
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:27,370
One stretch goal.

3671
02:24:27,470 --> 02:24:27,730

3674
02:24:32,050 --> 02:24:32,990
Yes!

3675
02:24:33,170 --> 02:24:40,530
Alright, so my mama will be a secret until my skin suit is done.

3676
02:24:41,090 --> 02:24:44,710
But I did get permission.

3677
02:24:45,110 --> 02:24:46,390
Unlike the ditto cover.

3678
02:24:46,810 --> 02:24:48,530
Let me message ditto real quick.

3679
02:24:55,250 --> 02:25:00,670
Let me message ditto real quick about if she wants to do this.

3680
02:25:04,050 --> 02:25:04,610
Okay.

3681
02:25:04,930 --> 02:25:05,490
Alright.

3682
02:25:06,190 --> 02:25:06,750
Okay.

3683
02:25:09,550 --> 02:25:10,110
Sorry,

3684
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:15,780

3685
02:25:16,060 --> 02:25:16,900
Secret collab.

3686
02:25:18,660 --> 02:25:20,120
Will be announced later.

3687
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:22,400
It's for Charity.

3688
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:25,880
Guys, I'm not gonna fucking blackmail her with Charity.

3689
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:26,600
Not blackmail.

3690
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:29,540
I'm not gonna manipulate her with Charity, guys.

3691
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:33,660
I'll just be like, hey ditto, do you wanna do a cover with me?

3692
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:36,020
Yeah.

3693
02:25:38,460 --> 02:25:39,060
Alright.

3694
02:25:43,700 --> 02:25:44,720
Alright, there we go.

3695
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:45,160
Alright.

3696
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:46,300
Anyway.

3697
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:47,920
Anyway.

3698
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:49,420
It's not blackmail.

3699
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:51,900
It's manipulation, which I will not do.

3700
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:58,900
Just so you guys know, it's actually manipulation.

3701
02:25:59,260 --> 02:26:01,540
But I will not be manipulating anyone.

3702
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:05,440
All I said was, will you do a cover with me?

3703
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:06,680
I didn't mention that.

3704
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:09,260
I did not mention Charity.

3705
02:26:09,260 --> 02:26:09,780
I did not mention Charity.

3706
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:10,620

02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:45,260

3724
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:51,720

Okay, and then I'll follow them too.

02:26:58,160 --> 02:26:59,100
It's official.

3729
02:26:59,180 --> 02:27:00,320
It's not a secret anymore.

3730
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:04,420
It's not a secret anymore.

3731
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:05,620
I've also followed them.

3732
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:06,540
So that's when you...

3733
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:08,920
Doki Amber Doge.

3734
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:13,280
Please.

3735
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:20,780
Also, they don't consented.

3736
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:24,800
So yeah, cover approved.

3737
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:28,040
Now it's official.

3738
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:29,340
Now it's official.

3739
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:31,660
Anyway, where the fuck is the...

3740
02:27:31,660 --> 02:27:31,860
Okay.

3741
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:32,680
Alright.

3742
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:35,480
So my new papa.

3743
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:50,620
You might recognize their work because the reason why I picked them as my papa was because they've done a lot of really amazing work.

3744
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:55,860
And I really love the fluidity of their skin suits.

3745
02:27:57,080 --> 02:28:02,800
Especially like how well the mouth works.

3746
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:04,760
Because mouths are for this...

3747
02:28:04,760 --> 02:28:05,880
I don't know if you guys know this.

3748
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:10,860
But human mouths are like really hard to get right.

3749
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:26,140
So that's why I asked if they were able to be my new papa and doing the laundry and the laundry of my new skin suit.

3750
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:29,360
So this is my papa.

3751
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:31,840
Yay!

3752
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:32,040
Yay!

3753
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:35,440
Okay, I'll post their Twitter.

3754
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:37,160
So you guys know.

3755
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:40,020
Alright.

3756
02:28:40,160 --> 02:28:44,440
For those who are wondering what they've done in the past.

3757
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:47,540
They've done their most famous...

3758
02:28:47,540 --> 02:28:49,040
Or like not...

3759
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:50,940
I don't know if famous is the right word.

3760
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:57,740
But their most well known rigging is the one for...

3761
02:28:58,920 --> 02:28:59,600
Lymu?

3762
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:00,860
Or Lymu?

3763
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:01,800
I think that Lymu...

3764
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:05,040
Lymu which is the green ferret.

3765
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:06,400
The green white ferret.

3766
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:09,600
So they've done...

3767
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:12,840
Celia has done a lot of amazing...

3768
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:18,820
Amazing models or skin suits in the past.

3769
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:23,900
And like I said their most well known one was Lymu.

3770
02:29:24,020 --> 02:29:25,700
And Lymu...

3771
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:26,560
I'm so sorry.

3772
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:30,720
For mispronouncing.

3773
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:32,060
I'm so sorry.

3774
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:32,420
I'm...

3775
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:34,920
Please be patient.

3776
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:38,820
Please be patient.

3777
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:40,280
I'm a Vtuber.

3778
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:45,360
They've also...

3779
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:48,780
They've also done...

3780
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:50,760
They've also done...

3781
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:52,660
Stuff for...

3782
02:29:52,660 --> 02:29:54,800
Holostars as well.

3783
02:29:55,100 --> 02:29:56,120
So...

3784
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:58,440
So that's why I am...

3785
02:29:58,440 --> 02:30:00,300

3787
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:03,160
Working with them.

3788

3789
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:05,840

02:30:10,820 --> 02:30:11,860

3794
02:30:13,380 --> 02:30:15,160
Guys I need you guys to remember this.

3795
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:17,240
I was not really prepared for all of this.

3796
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:18,220
So...

3797
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:23,540

02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:08,280
I might need to ask little man's help.

3827
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:09,660

3829
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:12,300

Or like awake and watching.

3831
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:16,580

3833
02:31:18,440 --> 02:31:20,820
I don't know who I'm telling this to if you're not watching.

3834
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:21,860

Honestly...

3854
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:45,620
You don't have to like and retweet.

3855
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:46,160
Just comment.

3856
02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:46,760
Alright!

3857
02:31:48,140 --> 02:31:49,240
Actually, you should retweet.

3858
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:51,220
Because apparently when doing twitter giveaways.

3859
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:53,000
It's so fucking hard.

3860
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:53,820
To...

3861
02:31:53,820 --> 02:31:55,320
It's actually so difficult.

3862
02:31:55,620 --> 02:31:56,440
To like...

3863
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:57,040
Calc...

3864
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:57,400
Like...

3865
02:31:57,400 --> 02:31:57,920
To like...

3866
02:31:57,920 --> 02:31:58,920
Grab random...

3867
02:31:59,520 --> 02:31:59,640
Like...

3868
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:01,320
Usually they look at retweets.

3869
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:01,860
Like those...

3870
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:05,240
Those like bots that does like twitter giveaway pickers.

3871
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:06,640
Like where they pick the people.

3872
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:08,120
Please...

3873
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:11,860
I will kick you out of my room.

3874
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:17,520
Little man.

3875
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:19,900
Help me figure out what's the best way.

3876
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:20,720
Retweet?

3877
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:22,020
Or comment?

3878
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:22,840
Or like...

3879
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:23,320
On twitter?

3880
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:24,220
Or do it on stream?

3881
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:24,740
Anyway.

3882
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:26,340
I will be giving out...

3883
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:27,140
Um...

3884
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:27,900
I will be giving out...

3885
02:32:27,900 --> 02:32:28,740
Five...

3886
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:31,680
Five bundles from the debut.

3887
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:37,360
And five bundles from the Lunar New Year bundles.

3888
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:38,600
So...

3889
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:39,260
Um...

3890
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:40,340
So like...

3891
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:41,120
It's a lot.

3892
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:42,260
Because like...

3893
02:32:42,260 --> 02:32:42,600
Um...

3894
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:44,180
I feel like since there's a lot of you supporting.

3895
02:32:44,600 --> 02:32:45,100
Okay.

3896
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:47,980
I know ten might not be a lot to give away.

3897
02:32:48,220 --> 02:32:49,500
But it's the bundle.

3898
02:32:55,140 --> 02:32:55,740
So...

3899
02:32:55,740 --> 02:32:56,380
Um...

3900
02:32:56,380 --> 02:32:57,740
It will be ten merch...

3901
02:32:57,740 --> 02:32:57,880
10 merch...

3902
02:32:57,880 --> 02:32:58,720
That I'll be giving away.

3903
02:32:59,240 --> 02:32:59,680
But...

3904
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:00,560
I'll also...

3905
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:01,700
We're figuring out how to enter.

3906
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:02,960
Uh...

3907
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:03,940
We're gonna...

3908
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:06,440
We're gonna figure out how to enter this.

3909
02:33:06,700 --> 02:33:07,220
Don't worry.

3910
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:09,520
Little man and Mr. Man are figuring this out for me.

3911
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:10,100
Okay.

3912
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:11,040
I'm gonna kick you out.

3913
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:13,440
You've been naughty.

3914
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:14,020
Okay.

3915
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:14,380
Guys.

3916
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:14,800
Give me a sec.

3917
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:15,240
We got...

3918
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:16,220
I got him.

3919
02:33:16,440 --> 02:33:17,140
He can't...

3920
02:33:17,140 --> 02:33:18,120
The thing is...

3921
02:33:18,120 --> 02:33:19,860
He can open doors now.

3922
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:20,700
Like...

3923
02:33:20,700 --> 02:33:21,020
Okay.

3924
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:21,500
He like...

3925
02:33:21,500 --> 02:33:21,720
Okay.

3926
02:33:21,740 --> 02:33:22,800
Because my door fucking sucks.

3927
02:33:23,080 --> 02:33:24,180
All he does...

3928
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:25,320
Is that he like...

3929
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:26,420
Pushes the door...

3930
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:28,080
With his paw...

3931
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:29,300
Or his nose...

3932
02:33:29,300 --> 02:33:30,040
And he's like...

3933
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:30,820
I'm here now.

3934
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:36,400
Okay.

3935
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:37,720
All right.

3936
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:38,020
I'm

3937
02:33:41,410 --> 02:33:43,590
not picking up the fucking chicken.

3938
02:33:43,890 --> 02:33:44,550
All right.

3939
02:33:44,690 --> 02:33:45,170
All right.

3940
02:33:45,170 --> 02:33:45,530
Here you go.

3941
02:33:45,990 --> 02:33:46,510
He's...

3942
02:33:46,510 --> 02:33:46,730
He...

3943
02:33:46,730 --> 02:33:47,090
No!

3944
02:33:47,410 --> 02:33:47,930
No!

3945
02:33:48,610 --> 02:33:49,130
No!

3946
02:33:49,450 --> 02:33:50,130
All right.

3947
02:33:50,430 --> 02:33:50,950
Oh.

3948
02:33:52,030 --> 02:33:52,690
All right.

3949
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:53,090
Here you go.

3950
02:33:53,990 --> 02:33:54,650
All right.

3951
02:33:54,990 --> 02:33:55,550
All right.

3952
02:33:55,550 --> 02:33:55,750
He...

3953
02:33:55,750 --> 02:33:56,410
He...

3954
02:33:56,410 --> 02:33:57,030
He...

3955
02:33:57,030 --> 02:33:57,070
He...

3956
02:33:57,070 --> 02:33:57,550
He...

3957
02:33:57,570 --> 02:33:57,850
He's out.

3958
02:33:59,050 --> 02:34:00,830
He did nothing.

3959
02:34:00,850 --> 02:34:01,550
What do you mean?

3960
02:34:01,970 --> 02:34:04,030
I'm trying to have a conversation.

3961
02:34:04,650 --> 02:34:05,330
Like...

3962
02:34:05,330 --> 02:34:07,810
He did nothing wrong.

3963
02:34:08,370 --> 02:34:09,270
All right.

3964
02:34:09,730 --> 02:34:13,050
All right.

3965
02:34:13,070 --> 02:34:13,410
Anyway.

3966
02:34:13,870 --> 02:34:14,550
Okay.

3967
02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:15,690
All right.

3968
02:34:15,710 --> 02:34:17,230
He's out of the room now.

3969
02:34:17,810 --> 02:34:18,810
He's out.

3970
02:34:18,930 --> 02:34:20,450
Justice for dad.

3971
02:34:21,250 --> 02:34:22,890
Justice for dad.

3972
02:34:25,510 --> 02:34:26,190
Bro.

3973
02:34:26,310 --> 02:34:27,410
The moment I like...

3974
02:34:27,410 --> 02:34:27,550
I just...

3975
02:34:27,550 --> 02:34:28,170
He picked him up.

3976
02:34:28,190 --> 02:34:30,790
He tried to go for the chicken.

3977
02:34:30,910 --> 02:34:31,410
He's like...

3978
02:34:31,410 --> 02:34:32,790
Oh my god!

3979
02:34:32,810 --> 02:34:33,570
I'm taller now!

3980
02:34:33,930 --> 02:34:34,730
Oh my god!

3981
02:34:34,830 --> 02:34:37,070
I'm now in reach of the chicken!

3982
02:34:37,330 --> 02:34:37,970
I'm like, nope!

3983
02:34:38,310 --> 02:34:38,730
Nope!

3984
02:34:38,770 --> 02:34:39,330
Other way!

3985
02:34:40,370 --> 02:34:41,370
Other way!

3986
02:34:41,530 --> 02:34:42,570
Out the door!

3987
02:34:43,590 --> 02:34:44,170
Alright.

3988
02:34:44,390 --> 02:34:44,970
Anyway.

3989
02:34:45,210 --> 02:34:46,310
As I was...

3990
02:34:46,310 --> 02:34:49,690
As I was saying...

3991
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:51,010
He's like...

3992
02:34:51,010 --> 02:34:51,550
Oh!

3993
02:34:51,710 --> 02:34:52,850
I got the chicken!

3994
02:34:55,770 --> 02:34:56,290
Alright.

3995
02:34:57,450 --> 02:34:59,070
As I was saying... What was I saying?

3996
02:34:59,610 --> 02:35:00,110
But, okay.

3997
02:35:00,310 --> 02:35:00,590
Alright.

3998
02:35:00,690 --> 02:35:04,430
Let's pick out the next merch drop.

3999
02:35:04,590 --> 02:35:10,330
I'll give you guys... You guys give me four suggestions on the theme of the merch drop.

4000
02:35:10,530 --> 02:35:15,310
And I'll let you pick one product to be made in production in this drop.

4001
02:35:15,570 --> 02:35:19,770
So, that is the choices I'm giving you guys.

4002
02:35:20,870 --> 02:35:22,830
Most likely, it has to be...

4003
02:35:22,850 --> 02:35:23,750
Within...

4004
02:35:24,550 --> 02:35:27,270
So, like... The theme has to fit...

4005
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:30,210
Obviously, I can't get it made in production really fast.

4006
02:35:30,530 --> 02:35:33,850
So, like... Just plus four months and then...

4007
02:35:34,650 --> 02:35:36,270
One, two, three, four.

4008
02:35:36,450 --> 02:35:37,850
So, July and after.

4009
02:35:38,170 --> 02:35:40,090
Guys, I can't do Easter.

4010
02:35:40,150 --> 02:35:41,530
I cannot do like...

4011
02:35:41,530 --> 02:35:43,770
I cannot do Easter.

4012
02:35:45,390 --> 02:35:48,230
Because it's way too soon.

4013
02:35:48,590 --> 02:35:51,610
The merch drop will come out...

4014
02:35:51,610 --> 02:35:53,390
In like... After...

4015
02:35:53,390 --> 02:35:55,510
Like with July and after.

4016
02:35:55,610 --> 02:35:56,890
Maybe after July.

4017
02:35:58,130 --> 02:35:58,650
So...

4018
02:35:59,290 --> 02:35:59,810
Okay.

4019
02:35:59,850 --> 02:36:00,530
There's summertime.

4020
02:36:01,130 --> 02:36:02,310
I see some...

4021
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:03,090
Swimsuit.

4022
02:36:03,410 --> 02:36:03,930
Okay.

4023
02:36:03,990 --> 02:36:05,190
I'll say summertime.

4024
02:36:05,470 --> 02:36:05,990
Okay.

4025
02:36:06,450 --> 02:36:06,970
Summertime.

4026
02:36:11,370 --> 02:36:13,930
We're not gonna be able to do this in St. Pat...

4027
02:36:13,930 --> 02:36:14,130
Wait.

4028
02:36:14,190 --> 02:36:15,090
When's St. Patrick's?

4029
02:36:15,110 --> 02:36:18,250
We're definitely not able to do this in St. Patrick's.

4030
02:36:18,970 --> 02:36:19,490
Alright.

4031
02:36:21,610 --> 02:36:21,810
Okay.

4032
02:36:23,210 --> 02:36:24,490
Tomato themed.

4033
02:36:25,410 --> 02:36:27,130
Fucking tomato themed.

4034
02:36:29,390 --> 02:36:29,710
Alright.

4035
02:36:30,230 --> 02:36:30,870
Summer.

4036
02:36:31,470 --> 02:36:32,290
Tomato... Okay.

4037
02:36:32,450 --> 02:36:33,970
Halloween is so generic.

4038
02:36:34,070 --> 02:36:37,850
Like, you gotta assume that I was gonna make a Halloween theme anyway.

4039
02:36:38,190 --> 02:36:39,530
Try to think like...

4040
02:36:39,530 --> 02:36:41,990
Try to expand your horizons, chat.

4041
02:36:42,110 --> 02:36:45,050
We need you to expand your horizons right now.

4042
02:36:45,450 --> 02:36:46,870
Think beyond...

4043
02:36:47,450 --> 02:36:49,090
Like the generic theme.

4044
02:36:51,610 --> 02:36:52,070
Okay.

4045
02:36:52,550 --> 02:36:53,070
Halloween.

4046
02:36:54,130 --> 02:36:54,650
Uh...

4047
02:36:54,650 --> 02:36:55,610
Oh, not Halloween.

4048
02:36:55,670 --> 02:36:55,890
Fuck.

4049
02:36:55,970 --> 02:36:56,190
Okay.

4050
02:36:56,230 --> 02:36:57,130
Now you're fucking with me.

4051
02:36:57,190 --> 02:36:57,570
Tomato!

4052
02:36:59,090 --> 02:36:59,870
Summer festival.

4053
02:37:00,250 --> 02:37:01,190
Or summertime.

4054
02:37:02,430 --> 02:37:02,950
Um...

4055
02:37:02,950 --> 02:37:03,870
Tomato.

4056
02:37:04,250 --> 02:37:04,770
Summer.

4057
02:37:06,930 --> 02:37:07,450
Um...

4058
02:37:07,450 --> 02:37:08,030
What else?

4059
02:37:08,490 --> 02:37:09,450
What else, guys?

4060
02:37:10,390 --> 02:37:13,370
We're not gonna make America as a thing.

4061
02:37:13,910 --> 02:37:14,430
Okay.

4062
02:37:14,550 --> 02:37:17,710
I will put America as I swear to God.

4063
02:37:17,910 --> 02:37:18,430
Like...

4064
02:37:20,090 --> 02:37:21,590
July 4th is literally the year of the...

4065
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:22,610
It's literally my birthday!

4066
02:37:23,170 --> 02:37:24,330
You guys ready?

4067
02:37:24,570 --> 02:37:24,850
Yeah.

4068
02:37:28,370 --> 02:37:30,750
It's literally my birthday.

4069
02:37:31,250 --> 02:37:32,010
Okay.

4070
02:37:32,470 --> 02:37:33,230
Um...

4071
02:37:33,230 --> 02:37:34,430
Alright.

4072
02:37:34,750 --> 02:37:35,490
Okay.

4073
02:37:35,570 --> 02:37:36,990
We'll do America.

4074
02:37:38,090 --> 02:37:38,850
America...

4075
02:37:38,850 --> 02:37:39,150
No!

4076
02:37:39,250 --> 02:37:41,470
America's birthday was named after my birthday.

4077
02:37:41,670 --> 02:37:41,950
Okay.

4078
02:37:43,370 --> 02:37:46,110
They're celebrating my birthday.

4079
02:37:46,450 --> 02:37:47,050
Okay.

4080
02:37:47,410 --> 02:37:48,690
Last one.

4081
02:37:49,070 --> 02:37:49,830
Tomato.

4082
02:37:49,930 --> 02:37:50,690
Summer.

4083
02:37:50,830 --> 02:37:51,450
America.

4084
02:37:51,450 --> 02:37:51,570
Summer.

4085
02:37:51,570 --> 02:37:51,850
America.

4086
02:37:52,170 --> 02:37:52,610
Alright.

4087
02:37:52,810 --> 02:37:54,470
What's the last theme you want?

4088
02:37:55,070 --> 02:37:55,510
Alright.

4089
02:37:55,530 --> 02:37:57,490
And then we're gonna put it up to a vote.

4090
02:37:58,710 --> 02:38:01,250
It'll be up to a vote for all of you.

4091
02:38:01,450 --> 02:38:02,130
We're not...

4092
02:38:02,130 --> 02:38:02,930
We're not...

4093
02:38:02,930 --> 02:38:03,790
I'm not gonna get fucking...

4094
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:09,230
Despite EA having a group relationship with me, I do not want EA to...

4095
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:10,830
I don't want to piss them off.

4096
02:38:15,030 --> 02:38:15,470
Okay.

4097
02:38:16,370 --> 02:38:17,030
Magical girl.

4098
02:38:17,150 --> 02:38:17,410
Okay.

4099
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:17,910
That...

4100
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:18,810
Those are the four.

4101
02:38:19,250 --> 02:38:20,530
Those are the four, right?

4102
02:38:21,570 --> 02:38:21,950
You guys.

4103
02:38:22,150 --> 02:38:23,090
Those four.

4104
02:38:23,470 --> 02:38:27,150
And then after that, we can decide what specific...

4105
02:38:27,150 --> 02:38:30,710
And we vote for the item that you really, really want in the drop.

4106
02:38:30,970 --> 02:38:31,470
Alright.

4107
02:38:32,710 --> 02:38:33,270
Um...

4108
02:38:33,270 --> 02:38:35,530
Theme for merch drop.

4109
02:38:35,930 --> 02:38:36,370
Okay.

4110
02:38:36,510 --> 02:38:37,070
Tomato.

4111
02:38:37,630 --> 02:38:38,190
America.

4112
02:38:42,290 --> 02:38:49,810
Yeah, there could have been like cooking or like masquerade or like, you know, like, you know, like...

4113
02:38:51,910 --> 02:38:58,670
There could have been like very nice themes, but instead we got America tomato.

4114
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:00,350
Okay.

4115
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:03,230
Magical girl.

4116
02:39:03,610 --> 02:39:04,850
I don't even know what...

4117
02:39:04,850 --> 02:39:06,810
I guess we could do jewelry for magical girls.

4118
02:39:07,050 --> 02:39:07,470
Alright.

4119
02:39:07,570 --> 02:39:08,010
Here we go.

4120
02:39:09,670 --> 02:39:12,110
The theme for the merch drop.

4121
02:39:12,810 --> 02:39:13,350
Alright.

4122
02:39:13,390 --> 02:39:14,810
I will give you guys...

4123
02:39:15,410 --> 02:39:20,430
I'll give you guys like 10 minutes to figure out while we do the...

4124
02:39:20,430 --> 02:39:21,290
While we...

4125
02:39:21,290 --> 02:39:21,550
While we...

4126
02:39:21,550 --> 02:39:22,170
Talk about...

4127
02:39:22,170 --> 02:39:22,430
I can't...

4128
02:39:22,430 --> 02:39:22,570
Okay.

4129
02:39:22,650 --> 02:39:26,490
We're gonna have to do a poll for the chat picks do I cover what you saw.

4130
02:39:26,630 --> 02:39:28,830
By the way, I did get permission.

4131
02:39:29,250 --> 02:39:34,910
Just so you guys know, we do have permission to do a cover of you saw.

4132
02:39:36,310 --> 02:39:37,550
In case people...

4133
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:41,710
In case people are like, did you ask you saw?

4134
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:44,790
Thankfully, you saw was totally down.

4135
02:39:45,610 --> 02:39:46,630
Thank God.

4136
02:39:47,710 --> 02:39:48,270
Okay.

4137
02:39:49,090 --> 02:39:49,650
Okay.

4138
02:39:51,810 --> 02:39:52,210
Um...

4139
02:39:54,850 --> 02:39:55,250
Anyway.

4140
02:39:57,130 --> 02:39:57,530
Anyway.

4141
02:39:57,810 --> 02:39:59,130
As I was...

4142
02:39:59,850 --> 02:40:00,250
Uh...

4143
02:40:02,070 --> 02:40:04,070
As I was saying...

4144
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:05,190
Uh...

4145
02:40:05,190 --> 02:40:06,530
As I was saying...

4146
02:40:06,530 --> 02:40:07,090
What was I gonna say?

4147
02:40:07,210 --> 02:40:07,490
Fuck.

4148
02:40:07,530 --> 02:40:07,790
Okay.

4149
02:40:07,830 --> 02:40:08,670
I already lost my count.

4150
02:40:08,990 --> 02:40:09,390
Alright.

4151
02:40:09,630 --> 02:40:10,010
Uh...

4152
02:40:11,010 --> 02:40:11,410
Yes.

4153
02:40:11,530 --> 02:40:14,550
Summer can be like beach and...

4154
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:15,150
Uh...

4155
02:40:15,150 --> 02:40:16,330
This is not bathtub.

4156
02:40:16,390 --> 02:40:16,830
It's a beach.

4157
02:40:16,890 --> 02:40:17,090
Sorry.

4158
02:40:17,170 --> 02:40:18,330
I just had to say that out loud.

4159
02:40:18,410 --> 02:40:20,170
It was like fucking plaguing my mind.

4160
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:24,650
Anyway.

4161
02:40:25,170 --> 02:40:25,730
Anyway.

4162
02:40:25,910 --> 02:40:27,170
As I was saying...

4163
02:40:27,170 --> 02:40:27,930
Um...

4164
02:40:28,970 --> 02:40:32,930
I can't do the vote for the you saw cover yet.

4165
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:35,650
Because obviously, uh...

4166
02:40:35,650 --> 02:40:36,850
We need to use the poll.

4167
02:40:37,050 --> 02:40:39,510
The poll is being used right now for...

4168
02:40:39,510 --> 02:40:40,130
You know...

4169
02:40:40,130 --> 02:40:40,510
For...

4170
02:40:40,510 --> 02:40:43,290
For the theme for the merch shop.

4171
02:40:43,790 --> 02:40:44,350
Um...

4172
02:40:44,350 --> 02:40:44,850
Anyway.

4173
02:40:45,970 --> 02:40:47,150
We are going...

4174
02:40:47,150 --> 02:40:47,930
Holy shit.

4175
02:40:47,970 --> 02:40:50,210
The meta poster is on 5k?

4176
02:40:50,290 --> 02:40:50,470
Oh my God.

4177
02:40:51,930 --> 02:40:53,170
Oh my God.

4178
02:40:54,790 --> 02:40:56,410
You really like paper.

4179
02:41:01,270 --> 02:41:03,010
Oh my God.

4180
02:41:04,090 --> 02:41:05,210
Holy shit.

4181
02:41:05,530 --> 02:41:06,370
I'm like...

4182
02:41:06,370 --> 02:41:06,850
Oh really?

4183
02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:07,250
I'm...

4184
02:41:07,250 --> 02:41:07,930
I'm like...

4185
02:41:07,930 --> 02:41:08,150
Wow.

4186
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:09,210
Holy shit.

4187
02:41:09,450 --> 02:41:10,290
You know what?

4188
02:41:10,790 --> 02:41:12,050
Good for that guy.

4189
02:41:12,330 --> 02:41:13,670
Good for that guy.

4190
02:41:14,230 --> 02:41:14,830
Um...

4191
02:41:14,830 --> 02:41:15,790
It's...

4192
02:41:15,790 --> 02:41:16,070
Sorry.

4193
02:41:16,190 --> 02:41:16,490
Sorry.

4194
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:17,730
Metal paper.

4195
02:41:17,910 --> 02:41:18,810
I'm so sorry.

4196
02:41:18,910 --> 02:41:19,230
I forgot.

4197
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:20,450
Metal paper.

4198
02:41:24,430 --> 02:41:26,110
Oh my God.

4199
02:41:26,230 --> 02:41:26,950
I mean...

4200
02:41:26,950 --> 02:41:33,190
I'm not surprised that metal paper has like more people bidding on it than regular paper.

4201
02:41:33,530 --> 02:41:35,310
I'm not surprised about that.

4202
02:41:35,470 --> 02:41:36,290
Holy fuck.

4203
02:41:36,590 --> 02:41:37,130
Okay.

4204
02:41:38,230 --> 02:41:38,930
Anyway.

4205
02:41:39,070 --> 02:41:39,830
As I was...

4206
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:40,190
Sorry.

4207
02:41:40,250 --> 02:41:43,030
I got like really distracted by the paper there.

4208
02:41:43,110 --> 02:41:43,930
Looking at it.

4209
02:41:44,710 --> 02:41:45,410
Um...

4210
02:41:47,750 --> 02:41:50,110
As I was saying...

4211
02:41:50,450 --> 02:41:55,170
Leaking upcoming projects and work in progress.

4212
02:41:55,230 --> 02:41:59,050
So this is something I asked Mr. Man.

4213
02:41:59,350 --> 02:42:00,930
Like there's like stuff I asked...

4214
02:42:00,930 --> 02:42:02,750
Like stuff I wanted to show you guys.

4215
02:42:03,230 --> 02:42:03,850
Like...

4216
02:42:03,850 --> 02:42:06,910
And stuff that Mr. Man said I can reveal.

4217
02:42:08,090 --> 02:42:08,710
Uh...

4218
02:42:09,530 --> 02:42:12,950
Obviously I can't reveal like everything about it.

4219
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:17,910
But I can say like...

4220
02:42:17,910 --> 02:42:19,510
I can reveal like...

4221
02:42:24,830 --> 02:42:27,150
So, yes, this is Mr. Man approved.

4222
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:31,430
Like we had to ask permission if I can reveal it on stream.

4223
02:42:33,050 --> 02:42:36,630
And they said yes, but only like parts of it.

4224
02:42:40,450 --> 02:42:41,490
But basically...

4225
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:43,410
Drumroll please.

4226
02:42:45,830 --> 02:42:48,750
I sound like America is losing.

4227
02:42:49,430 --> 02:42:53,890
Alright, the first thing I'm gonna leak or announce...

4228
02:42:55,030 --> 02:42:58,030
Okay, I need to make sure I don't accidentally say the wrong thing.

4229
02:42:58,210 --> 02:43:00,250
I never read what I can say.

4230
02:43:03,370 --> 02:43:11,190
Okay, the first thing is that I will be at Anime Expo.

That is being worked on at the moment.

4327
02:49:04,730 --> 02:49:10,990
I believe it will be done around maybe mid March or end of March.

4328
02:49:11,130 --> 02:49:13,630
It really depends on the animator.

4329
02:49:13,790 --> 02:49:16,170
I love working with this animator.

4330
02:49:16,350 --> 02:49:20,490
I've been working with them since for like 3 or 4 years I think.

4331
02:49:20,710 --> 02:49:28,050
I've always loved their work and I'm really happy to be able to keep working with them and to make a new intro!

4332
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:34,610

Thank you for the 10 gift that's just Thank you thank you!

4352
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:44,310
Um but yes look forward to that at the end of March where it will be uh where it will be released.

4353
02:50:44,610 --> 02:50:46,310
Where I will finally be able to use it.

4354
02:50:46,470 --> 02:50:52,330
Um I know um in the future it's definitely gonna get updated whenever I do getting new skins soon.

4355
02:50:52,450 --> 02:50:57,070
Um Hoopyon has uh has like blocked off a date.

4356
02:50:57,230 --> 02:51:00,930
So I will be able to use it a month uh general month to like rework on it later on in the future.

4357
02:51:01,110 --> 02:51:03,750
Uh to update it to update it if needed.

4358
02:51:03,930 --> 02:51:07,530
So um it might not be the one version of the intro.

4359
02:51:07,670 --> 02:51:10,630
There's gonna be more versions of this intro in the future.

4360
02:51:10,870 --> 02:51:13,030
So something else to look forward to.

4361
02:51:13,090 --> 02:51:19,470
So it might not be like uh whenever I do get the updated skin suit it the intro is going to look different.

4362
02:51:19,730 --> 02:51:24,010
Um but for now it's based off my current skin suit.

4363
02:51:24,450 --> 02:51:24,930
Yeah!

4364
02:51:25,710 --> 02:51:30,210
Like I'll still be using uh it will be basing it off of my current skin suit for now.

4365
02:51:30,490 --> 02:51:33,770
And then she's she's gonna edit it to update it in the future.

4366
02:51:36,950 --> 02:51:44,890
So yes that is I don't know let me see if there's anything else I can legally uh show you guys.

4367
02:51:49,050 --> 02:52:24,750
Um let me double check if there's anything else that I can um I mean I've talked about this before but the next big event slash project that I'll be working on I think I've talked about it in general but like I never said it officially but the next official project that I'll be working on that I've been in talks with Mr. Man about this um is going to be like this the next event I'm planning on.

4368
02:52:24,990 --> 02:52:30,090
Because this is like more so of a small scale you know like the hardest part of doing all of this was the auction in general.

4369
02:52:31,190 --> 02:52:48,530
But the next event that I'll be hosting um after this will be the uh VTuber WW uh sorry not WW the VTuber Wrestling Event.

4370
02:52:48,690 --> 02:52:53,650
That will be my next official event that I will be organizing.

4371
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:56,310
Um after the charity.

4372
02:52:56,490 --> 02:53:00,230
So it's all still being planned and everything.

4373
02:53:00,490 --> 02:53:05,890
Like it's being like brainstormed at the moment on the logistics of everything that's going to be going on.

4374
02:53:06,190 --> 02:53:13,730
But the uh next big event I'm planning on will be VTuber slash wrestling event.

4375
02:53:14,190 --> 02:53:27,610
Hahahaha Hahahaha So that is my so it's sort of like for those who are like wondering what it's going to be like so it's sort of like WWES so like it's like Wrestlemania type deal.

4376
02:53:27,930 --> 02:53:34,550

Uh and that is what I'm working on after this.

4378
02:53:38,450 --> 02:53:41,650
Obviously I was wanting to like work on multiple things at the same time.

4379
02:53:41,750 --> 02:53:44,150

It is like okay.

4552
03:00:38,580 --> 03:00:48,320
There is like this famous animal crossing booba mouse pad but instead of tomato it is like the animal crossing fruits and that is like what I am thinking of right now.

4553
03:00:48,420 --> 03:00:48,780
Hahaha.

4554
03:00:48,780 --> 03:00:50,820
That is actually what I am thinking of.

4555
03:00:51,080 --> 03:00:51,680
Okay.

4556
03:00:53,100 --> 03:00:53,500
Alright.

03:00:58,100 --> 03:00:59,740
I am going to see if I can find... Pull it up.

4561
03:00:59,920 --> 03:01:01,940
Animal crossing...

4562
03:01:03,460 --> 03:01:04,200
Oh my god.

4563
03:01:04,260 --> 03:01:05,640
This is so... This is going to be so cursed.

4564
03:01:05,980 --> 03:01:09,300
This is going to be so bad if it doesn't show up the one that I expected.

4565
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:10,480
Hahaha.

4566
03:01:11,840 --> 03:01:13,140

4567
03:01:13,260 --> 03:01:14,100
Oh it is this one.

4568
03:01:14,320 --> 03:01:16,180
I think I actually...

4569
03:01:16,180 --> 03:01:17,940
I think I almost bought this one.

4570
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:21,960
I am pretty sure I almost bought it because I was like oh my god this is so cute.

4571
03:01:22,140 --> 03:01:22,360
Hahaha.

4572
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:24,940
But it is this.

4573
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:25,720
Let me show you guys.

4574
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:26,740
It is this.

4575
03:01:27,020 --> 03:01:29,520
So it will be like this but tomatoes instead.

4576
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,060

Hahaha.

4581
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:40,180
I actually...

4582
03:01:40,180 --> 03:01:43,780
I almost ordered this because I was so...

4583
03:01:43,780 --> 03:01:45,820
The thing is I would never use it.

4584
03:01:45,900 --> 03:01:48,420
I would never use it because I have a gamer mouse pad.

4585
03:01:48,620 --> 03:01:50,200
But like it is so cute.

4586
03:01:50,220 --> 03:01:53,240
But instead of the fruits it is the tomatoes.

4587
03:01:53,600 --> 03:01:55,260
But only if it wins of course.

4588
03:01:55,500 --> 03:01:57,580
It is only if it wins guys.

4589
03:01:57,940 --> 03:01:59,260
If you are like guys please.

4590
03:01:59,500 --> 03:02:00,760
We could have tomatoes.

4591
03:02:01,240 --> 03:02:01,760
Please.

4592
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:03,040
Hahaha.

4593
03:02:05,620 --> 03:02:09,200
It is hard to vote for it because there is so many choices.

4594
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:12,700
There is so many choices but only one can win.

4595
03:02:12,980 --> 03:02:13,500
Chat.

4596
03:02:13,620 --> 03:02:16,920
Only one can win and then the rest would be like...

4597
03:02:16,920 --> 03:02:19,760
There can only be one super high production item.

4598
03:02:20,240 --> 03:02:24,140
Because like I can't afford to make several super high production items.

4599
03:02:24,980 --> 03:02:25,540
Hahaha.

4600
03:02:27,980 --> 03:02:28,540
Guys.

4601
03:02:28,780 --> 03:02:31,800
So only one can win guys.

4602
03:02:31,900 --> 03:02:36,500
I will give you guys 5 minutes to vote for your themed item.

4603
03:02:37,980 --> 03:02:38,960
And then...

4604
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:41,080
And then we will move on from there.

4605
03:02:41,220 --> 03:02:41,440
Okay.

4606
03:02:41,480 --> 03:02:41,960
What else?

4607
03:02:42,060 --> 03:02:44,300
What else can I show you guys?

4608
03:02:44,580 --> 03:02:45,400
What else?

4609
03:02:45,800 --> 03:02:46,900
Oh you guys want to see the next one?

4610
03:02:46,920 --> 03:02:48,960
The next Doki Bites short?

4611
03:02:49,700 --> 03:02:51,720
That is still being worked on?

4612
03:02:52,560 --> 03:02:53,700
I can show you guys that.

4613
03:02:53,880 --> 03:02:55,000
That one is really cute to show.

4614
03:02:55,160 --> 03:02:56,080
It is actually so funny.

4615
03:02:56,380 --> 03:02:56,600
Hahaha.

4616
03:02:57,880 --> 03:02:59,260
I will leak that one too.

4617
03:02:59,520 --> 03:03:03,560
I will leak to you guys the next Doki Bites animated short.

4618
03:03:04,340 --> 03:03:07,260
I am pretty sure this might be the one that is released next.

4619
03:03:07,580 --> 03:03:09,620
Judging by like how...

4620
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:13,460
Judging by like the timeline of everything.

4621
03:03:13,760 --> 03:03:18,740
I am pretty sure this one is the next Doki Bites short that is being released.

4622
03:03:19,020 --> 03:03:22,560
That would be the last thing I will leak out for you guys.

4623
03:03:23,700 --> 03:03:24,540
Regarding everything.

4624
03:03:25,180 --> 03:03:26,540
That would be the last thing.

4625
03:03:26,640 --> 03:03:28,240
And we are going to move on to the next stretch goal.

4626
03:03:30,820 --> 03:03:31,240
Alright.

4627
03:03:32,380 --> 03:03:33,020
Let's see.

4628
03:03:33,200 --> 03:03:33,980
Is this the right one?

4629
03:03:34,100 --> 03:03:34,280
Yeah.

4630
03:03:36,100 --> 03:03:37,760
You might recognize this animator.

4631
03:03:38,160 --> 03:03:39,900
I am really happy to keep working with them.

4632
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:40,500
Honestly.

4633
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:41,340
Alright.

4634
03:03:41,360 --> 03:03:43,380
Let me turn off my mic.

4635
03:03:44,180 --> 03:03:47,640
Butter my biscuits.

4636
03:03:47,780 --> 03:03:50,840

Okay.

03:04:02,400 --> 03:04:02,880
Alright.

4643
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:03,220
Um.

4644
03:04:03,660 --> 03:04:04,340
Wow.

4645
03:04:04,780 --> 03:04:07,100
That is a very big gun.

4646
03:04:07,500 --> 03:04:10,340
I wish I could have a closer look.

4647
03:04:10,860 --> 03:04:11,500
Hahaha.

4648
03:04:12,720 --> 03:04:13,400

This here gun ain't no toy for jesters like yourself.

4651
03:04:22,340 --> 03:04:25,420
Best keep your distance and you know what's good for you.

4652
03:04:25,560 --> 03:04:28,820
So why don't you tell me what you really came here for.

4653
03:04:29,400 --> 03:04:30,040
Wow.

4654
03:04:30,320 --> 03:04:30,740
Okay.

4655
03:04:30,780 --> 03:04:30,920
Wait.

4656
03:04:30,980 --> 03:04:31,060
Wait.

4657
03:04:31,060 --> 03:04:31,700
Wow sir.

4658
03:04:34,040 --> 03:04:34,680
Dangerous.

4659
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:34,900
Huh?

4660
03:04:35,260 --> 03:04:36,880
I love danger.

4661
03:04:37,360 --> 03:04:37,700
Hahaha.

4662
03:04:38,560 --> 03:04:39,200
Hahaha.

4663
03:04:39,680 --> 03:04:40,320
Hahaha.

4664
03:04:42,240 --> 03:04:44,220
Actually negative risk.

4665
03:04:46,460 --> 03:04:47,100
Yeah.

4666
03:04:47,280 --> 03:04:47,920
Alright.

4667
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:49,300
That was a little... Hahaha.

4668
03:04:50,200 --> 03:04:54,220
You might recognize that I worked with this animator multiple times.

4669
03:04:54,340 --> 03:04:56,620
I'm very happy to be able to keep working with him.

4670
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:57,600
Hahaha.

4671
03:04:58,700 --> 03:04:58,820
Hahaha.

4672
03:05:00,380 --> 03:05:05,820
I think my favorite part was like it's just like the x-ray vision on the tomato.

4673
03:05:05,980 --> 03:05:08,400
That's like my favorite part.

4674
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:09,600
Hahaha.

4675
03:05:11,180 --> 03:05:13,300
It's like the inner doki.

4676
03:05:13,800 --> 03:05:14,360
Hahaha.

4677
03:05:16,220 --> 03:05:17,080
Oh my god.

4678
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:18,160
You recognized the voice.

4679
03:05:18,520 --> 03:05:19,160

4680
03:05:19,260 --> 03:05:19,900
I know.

4681
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,480
It's so talented voice acting guys.

4682
03:05:22,660 --> 03:05:26,580
I'm so happy you guys are able to recognize the voice actor.

4683
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:27,700
Hahaha.

4684
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:33,360
Both voice actors are are incredibly talented.

4685
03:05:33,740 --> 03:05:39,620
I can't believe we were able to... I can't believe we were able to get them for the short.

4686
03:05:39,800 --> 03:05:41,020
Is that crazy?

4687
03:05:41,320 --> 03:05:43,800
I can't believe we were able to get them.

4688
03:05:44,680 --> 03:05:45,340
Hahaha.

4689
03:05:45,540 --> 03:05:46,160
Hahaha.

4690
03:05:48,520 --> 03:05:51,760
It was very hard to hire a hire...

4691
03:05:52,860 --> 03:05:56,100
They really booked up on their work schedule.

4692
03:05:56,400 --> 03:05:58,000
So I'm just... Oh my god.

4693
03:05:58,020 --> 03:05:59,880
I'm just so happy it was possible guys.

4694
03:06:00,140 --> 03:06:01,160
I'm so happy.

4695
03:06:02,920 --> 03:06:04,380
She was a bit...

4696
03:06:04,380 --> 03:06:06,540
Oh my... What did he say?

4697
03:06:06,780 --> 03:06:07,780
Excuse me.

4698
03:06:08,700 --> 03:06:09,320
Hahaha.

4699
03:06:11,580 --> 03:06:12,200
Hahaha.

4700
03:06:12,560 --> 03:06:12,560
Hahaha.

4701
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:13,820
Alright.

4702
03:06:14,280 --> 03:06:14,780
Okay.

4703
03:06:14,840 --> 03:06:19,440
Let me see what else... Let me see what else is on the stretch goal.

4704
03:06:20,160 --> 03:06:20,580
Alright.

4705
03:06:20,680 --> 03:06:21,400
Give me a sec.

4706
03:06:21,580 --> 03:06:21,840
Okay.

4707
03:06:22,160 --> 03:06:23,640
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

4708
03:06:23,680 --> 03:06:24,100

03:06:29,220 --> 03:06:29,580
Alright.

4711
03:06:29,620 --> 03:06:31,060
We'll do a karaoke stream in March.

4712
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:32,840
That I don't have to plan or anything.

4713
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:34,180
ASMR stream.

4714
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:35,180
That I don't have to plan.

4715
03:06:35,460 --> 03:06:35,740
Alright.

4716
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:36,900
Bento stream.

4717
03:06:37,480 --> 03:06:38,220
Chat design.

4718
03:06:38,380 --> 03:06:39,220
Theme and design.

4719
03:06:39,840 --> 03:06:40,260
Okay.

4720
03:06:40,480 --> 03:06:42,000
That will need to be voted on.

4721
03:06:42,220 --> 03:06:42,740
God damn.

4722
03:06:42,780 --> 03:06:43,880
There's so many voted... Okay.

4723
03:06:44,040 --> 03:06:45,860
There's so many voted on stretch goals.

4724
03:06:45,900 --> 03:06:46,840
I did not think this through.

4725
03:06:47,020 --> 03:06:47,420
Hahaha.

4726
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:50,740
I did not think this through.

4727
03:06:51,120 --> 03:06:51,700
Alright.

4728
03:06:51,840 --> 03:06:55,260
The winner is the tomato plushie.

4729
03:06:56,100 --> 03:06:56,680
Alright.

4730
03:06:56,800 --> 03:06:57,360
So.

4731
03:06:58,260 --> 03:07:06,520
We will have the tomato plushie as... I think the bento thing I'm gonna make a hashtag for it.

4732
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:08,340
As well as we will...

4733
03:07:08,340 --> 03:07:11,080
I'll make a community post for the bento stuff.

4734
03:07:11,380 --> 03:07:12,560
So, um...

4735
03:07:12,560 --> 03:07:14,180
So it lets me have time to think about it.

4736
03:07:14,220 --> 03:07:16,620
So like doing... deciding it right off the bat.

4737
03:07:16,760 --> 03:07:18,640
Because like bent... building bentos is not the only way to do this stuff.

4738
03:07:18,780 --> 03:07:22,380
It actually takes time for me to like brainstorm everything and grab materials.

4739
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:23,280
So.

4740
03:07:24,440 --> 03:07:25,500
The bento stream.

4741
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:28,400
The bento like ideas and all that stuff.

4742
03:07:28,580 --> 03:07:32,060
That will be decided in a community post.

4743
03:07:32,840 --> 03:07:33,440
Later.

4744
03:07:33,900 --> 03:07:34,700
Alright guys.

4745
03:07:34,880 --> 03:07:35,860
Instead of voting for stuff.

4746
03:07:36,980 --> 03:07:39,080
I will do the hot sauce.

4747
03:07:39,680 --> 03:07:40,280
Guys.

4748
03:07:40,560 --> 03:07:41,160

4749
03:07:42,280 --> 03:07:43,920

4750
03:07:44,340 --> 03:07:44,860
Hahaha.

4751
03:07:44,860 --> 03:07:45,220
Hahaha.

4752
03:07:47,440 --> 03:07:50,460
Let me write down for myself.

4753
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:55,620
I need to write down for myself tomato... I'm gonna put tomato plushie.

4754
03:07:55,660 --> 03:07:56,020
Let me...

4755
03:07:56,770 --> 03:07:58,200
tomato plushie.

4756
03:07:58,600 --> 03:07:59,180
Hahaha.

4757
03:08:00,520 --> 03:08:02,700
I need to write this down for myself.

4758
03:08:03,100 --> 03:08:03,680
Okay.

4759
03:08:03,960 --> 03:08:04,380
Alright.

4760
03:08:04,500 --> 03:08:06,480
I'll show you guys the hot sauce.

4761
03:08:07,080 --> 03:08:07,660
Okay.

4762
03:08:08,620 --> 03:08:09,200
Okay.

4763
03:08:09,240 --> 03:08:10,580
I'm just gonna grab it off Google.

4764
03:08:10,660 --> 03:08:11,200
It's easier.

4765
03:08:11,360 --> 03:08:12,400
Cause like it's...

4766
03:08:12,400 --> 03:08:12,880
Hahaha.

4767
03:08:13,480 --> 03:08:14,620
The last...

4768
03:08:14,860 --> 03:08:15,960
dab...

4769
03:08:16,860 --> 03:08:17,280
experience.

4770
03:08:17,680 --> 03:08:18,280
Okay.

4771
03:08:18,380 --> 03:08:19,020
Alright.

4772
03:08:19,300 --> 03:08:21,020
This is 2 million.

4773
03:08:21,180 --> 03:08:21,820
By the way.

4774
03:08:21,840 --> 03:08:22,840
I need you guys to know.

4775
03:08:23,160 --> 03:08:25,020
That this hot sauce...

4776
03:08:25,020 --> 03:08:27,040
is 2 million.

4777
03:08:27,480 --> 03:08:28,020
Hahaha.

4778
03:08:28,020 --> 03:08:30,460
The basketball ad is finally finished.

4779
03:08:30,900 --> 03:08:31,500
Hahaha.

4780
03:08:32,580 --> 03:08:34,360
This is only the intermission.

4781
03:08:34,440 --> 03:08:35,280
What do you mean?

4782
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:38,720
We're back in ads.

4783
03:08:38,860 --> 03:08:40,540
Very soon after this.

4784
03:08:40,740 --> 03:08:42,720
This is just the intermission.

4785
03:08:43,040 --> 03:08:43,720
Okay.

4786
03:08:43,860 --> 03:08:44,540
Anyway.

4787
03:08:44,860 --> 03:08:45,560
Alright.

4788
03:08:45,740 --> 03:08:46,480
So...

4789
03:08:46,480 --> 03:08:47,560
This is...

4790
03:08:47,560 --> 03:08:50,220
This is the...

4791
03:08:50,860 --> 03:08:53,180
Over 91% pepper.

4792
03:08:53,280 --> 03:08:54,400
By the way.

4793
03:08:54,780 --> 03:08:55,780
Um...

4794
03:08:56,700 --> 03:08:57,200
Yay!

4795
03:08:58,740 --> 03:08:59,240
Alright.

4796
03:08:59,400 --> 03:09:00,060
So...

4797
03:09:00,500 --> 03:09:01,780
This is...

4798
03:09:02,420 --> 03:09:06,180
The hot sauce that I will be using.

4799
03:09:06,200 --> 03:09:07,640
It is 2 million.

4800
03:09:09,080 --> 03:09:10,080
Hahaha.

4801
03:09:10,800 --> 03:09:11,300
Hahaha.

4802
03:09:14,450 --> 03:09:15,450
Alright.

4803
03:09:15,610 --> 03:09:16,390
I feel like...

4804
03:09:16,610 --> 03:09:17,850
Let me... I need to play...

4805
03:09:17,850 --> 03:09:20,230
A song that matches this.

4806
03:09:20,310 --> 03:09:22,230
Let me YouTube a song real quick.

4807
03:09:22,470 --> 03:09:23,670
I... I swear!

4808
03:09:23,950 --> 03:09:26,430
If they claim this song...

4809
03:09:26,430 --> 03:09:27,210
It's fine.

4810
03:09:27,530 --> 03:09:28,890
It's not even...

4811
03:09:28,890 --> 03:09:30,490
Like... This is a charity stream.

4812
03:09:30,570 --> 03:09:31,550
What if they claim it?

4813
03:09:31,650 --> 03:09:32,670
I just realized.

4814
03:09:32,750 --> 03:09:32,910
Wait.

4815
03:09:32,990 --> 03:09:33,970
This is a charity stream.

4816
03:09:34,010 --> 03:09:35,770
I don't give a fuck if they claim this.

4817
03:09:36,230 --> 03:09:36,670
Hahaha.

4818
03:09:37,670 --> 03:09:38,230
Hahaha.

4819
03:09:39,790 --> 03:09:41,270
I almost forgot.

4820
03:09:41,450 --> 03:09:43,410
I was doing this for charity.

4821
03:09:43,410 --> 03:09:45,350
I was thinking about content.

4822
03:09:45,670 --> 03:09:47,110
I was thinking about...

4823
03:09:47,110 --> 03:09:47,770
Okay.

4824
03:09:49,210 --> 03:09:50,470
Is it... Alright.

4825
03:09:50,710 --> 03:09:52,750
It doesn't matter what song I play anyway.

4826
03:09:52,750 --> 03:09:53,970
As long as it's not blocked.

4827
03:09:54,510 --> 03:09:55,610
Is this song good?

4828
03:09:56,410 --> 03:09:58,530
Can the church copyright claim me?

4829
03:09:59,690 --> 03:10:00,450
I don't...

4830
03:10:00,450 --> 03:10:01,170
I swear.

4831
03:10:01,250 --> 03:10:02,990
If the church copyright claim me...

4832
03:10:02,990 --> 03:10:04,630
I swear to God!

4833
03:10:07,230 --> 03:10:08,490
I swear to God.

4834
03:10:08,530 --> 03:10:11,210
If the church copyright claim me...

4835
03:10:11,210 --> 03:10:11,500
Hahaha.

4836
03:10:12,030 --> 03:10:12,470
Hahaha.

4837
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:14,790
I swear to God.

4838
03:10:15,530 --> 03:10:16,490
I swear to God.

4839
03:10:16,490 --> 03:10:17,290
Alright.

4840
03:10:17,610 --> 03:10:18,810
I'm gonna shake this.

4841
03:10:26,960 --> 03:10:27,800
Grabbing the chicken.

4842
03:10:37,130 --> 03:10:38,090
Okay.

4843
03:10:38,090 --> 03:10:38,630
Six minutes.

4844
03:10:38,690 --> 03:10:39,870
I have six minutes to...

4845
03:10:40,650 --> 03:10:41,130
Okay.

4846
03:10:43,110 --> 03:10:46,010
Jesus is not public domain.

4847
03:10:46,670 --> 03:10:47,310
Hahaha.

4848
03:10:47,850 --> 03:10:48,810
Hahaha.

4849
03:10:48,810 --> 03:10:49,390
Hahaha.

4850
03:10:49,730 --> 03:10:53,070
Jesus please don't kill my video.

4851
03:10:53,310 --> 03:10:54,550
It's charity.

4852
03:10:54,930 --> 03:10:55,490
Hahaha.

4853
03:11:00,650 --> 03:11:01,690
I'm so scared.

4854
03:11:04,770 --> 03:11:05,330
I'm

4855
03:11:08,430 --> 03:11:08,990
gonna...

4856
03:11:09,590 --> 03:11:10,150
Oh!

4857
03:11:13,850 --> 03:11:15,990
It has to be louder so I can like...

4858
03:11:15,990 --> 03:11:16,670
feel God.

4859
03:11:17,310 --> 03:11:17,870
Hahaha.

4860
03:11:19,470 --> 03:11:21,030
It needs to be louder.

4861
03:11:21,230 --> 03:11:23,170
I need God by my side.

4862
03:11:24,410 --> 03:11:25,370
Oh my God.

4863
03:11:25,390 --> 03:11:26,930
I need to wash my hands after this too.

4864
03:11:27,030 --> 03:11:27,610
I'm so scared.

4865
03:11:29,790 --> 03:11:30,350
Okay.

4866
03:11:30,350 --> 03:11:30,550
Okay.

4867
03:11:31,890 --> 03:11:32,450
Oh.

4868
03:11:32,650 --> 03:11:32,970
Okay.

4869
03:11:33,010 --> 03:11:34,770
Pouring the hot sauce on my chicken.

4870
03:11:37,110 --> 03:11:37,670
Ah!

4871
03:11:42,790 --> 03:11:43,350
Okay.

4872
03:11:49,340 --> 03:11:49,900
Pouring.

4873
03:11:49,900 --> 03:11:51,900
Just making sure I don't pour too much.

4874
03:11:57,930 --> 03:11:59,070
Oh my God.

4875
03:11:59,110 --> 03:11:59,870
What the fuck?

4876
03:12:00,090 --> 03:12:00,470
Oh!

4877
03:12:00,510 --> 03:12:01,490
That's too much!

4878
03:12:03,450 --> 03:12:03,850
Ah!

4879
03:12:07,230 --> 03:12:08,330
Oh my God.

4880
03:12:08,350 --> 03:12:09,010
It's so...

4881
03:12:09,010 --> 03:12:10,130
Oh my God.

4882
03:12:10,250 --> 03:12:10,710
It...

4883
03:12:10,710 --> 03:12:14,530
I can smell how spicy this is.

4884
03:12:14,670 --> 03:12:15,370
Oh no.

4885
03:12:16,990 --> 03:12:18,930
Oh, I can smell the spice.

4886
03:12:19,250 --> 03:12:19,570
Oh.

4887
03:12:20,250 --> 03:12:22,630
I was not scared with the other hot sauce.

4888
03:12:22,730 --> 03:12:24,830
The other hot sauce were fucking weak.

4889
03:12:25,310 --> 03:12:26,970
But like, two million?

4890
03:12:27,390 --> 03:12:29,810
Two million is way too much million.

4891
03:12:34,210 --> 03:12:37,730
Two million is just too, too many millions.

4892
03:12:39,410 --> 03:12:42,590
The other ones were so weak, but two million.

4893
03:12:42,990 --> 03:12:46,430
It's 98% pepper.

4894
03:12:49,250 --> 03:12:51,230
Yes, this hot sauce is two million.

4895
03:12:52,030 --> 03:12:52,570
SHU.

4896
03:12:53,510 --> 03:12:54,050
Okay.

4897
03:12:56,350 --> 03:12:56,890
Okay.

4898
03:12:59,110 --> 03:12:59,650
Please.

4899
03:13:05,010 --> 03:13:05,550
Stop!

4900
03:13:05,830 --> 03:13:07,110
I need a field!

4901
03:13:07,610 --> 03:13:08,090
Jesus!

4902
03:13:08,810 --> 03:13:09,290
Guys!

4903
03:13:11,010 --> 03:13:13,030
I'm not feeling the Jesus yet!

4904
03:13:16,610 --> 03:13:17,090
Okay.

4905
03:13:20,030 --> 03:13:21,130
Alright, here we go.

4906
03:13:22,450 --> 03:13:23,190
Here we go.

4907
03:13:32,400 --> 03:13:32,880
Alright.

4908
03:13:33,160 --> 03:13:33,640
Three!

4909
03:13:35,140 --> 03:13:35,620
Two!

4910
03:13:35,720 --> 03:13:37,180
I can smell the pepper!

4911
03:13:38,120 --> 03:13:42,420
It's like, it's like 30 centimeters away from me and I still smell the pepper.

4912
03:13:42,800 --> 03:13:43,700
Okay, maybe 30.

4913
03:13:43,800 --> 03:13:44,040
20?

4914
03:13:44,040 --> 03:13:45,860
20 centimeters away from me and I still smell it.

4915
03:13:45,940 --> 03:13:46,300
Okay, maybe 30.

4916
03:13:46,300 --> 03:13:46,300
20?

4917
03:13:46,300 --> 03:13:46,300
20 centimeters away from me and I still smell it.

4918
03:13:46,320 --> 03:13:46,700
Okay.

4919
03:13:47,100 --> 03:13:47,860
Three.

4920
03:13:48,660 --> 03:13:49,420
Two.

4921
03:13:51,300 --> 03:13:52,060
One.

4922
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:20,980
Oh my god!

4923
03:14:22,120 --> 03:14:23,720
I don't eat more chicken!

4924
03:14:28,540 --> 03:14:30,440
Milk is for pussies!

4925
03:14:38,460 --> 03:14:39,940
Oh my god!

4926
03:14:43,480 --> 03:14:44,240
Oh my god!

4927
03:14:44,280 --> 03:14:45,280
Oh my god!

4928
03:14:48,940 --> 03:14:49,880
Oh my god!

4929
03:14:50,580 --> 03:14:51,640
Oh my god!

4930
03:14:53,800 --> 03:14:54,680
Oh my god!

4931
03:14:59,080 --> 03:14:59,920
Oh fuck!

4932
03:15:00,120 --> 03:15:00,440
Okay!

4933
03:15:03,180 --> 03:15:03,920
Oh fuck!

4934
03:15:04,060 --> 03:15:04,280
Okay.

4935
03:15:05,320 --> 03:15:07,140
I'm gonna sit with the spice for a little bit.

4936
03:15:10,100 --> 03:15:10,620
Oh.

4937
03:15:15,860 --> 03:15:16,760
Oh my god!

4938
03:15:17,620 --> 03:15:18,140
Okay.

4939
03:15:20,900 --> 03:15:21,820
I didn't...

4940
03:15:22,700 --> 03:15:23,220
Okay.

4941
03:15:28,930 --> 03:15:29,450
Okay.

4942
03:15:32,590 --> 03:15:33,470
Oh my god.

4943
03:15:33,890 --> 03:15:34,790
Fuck, okay.

4944
03:15:36,450 --> 03:15:37,230
Fuck, okay.

4945
03:15:39,890 --> 03:15:40,710
I'm a pussy.

4946
03:15:41,710 --> 03:15:42,910
Oh my god, okay.

4947
03:15:44,690 --> 03:15:46,090
I should laugh.

4948
03:15:46,530 --> 03:15:47,390
I should laugh.

4949
03:16:06,470 --> 03:16:07,230
Okay.

4950
03:16:07,230 --> 03:16:09,610
It actually tasted nice though.

4951
03:16:19,050 --> 03:16:23,890
Other than it being extremely spicy.

4952
03:16:24,210 --> 03:16:25,650
Oh my god, it's still burning.

4953
03:16:25,850 --> 03:16:27,130
It's still burning.

4954
03:16:29,390 --> 03:16:31,430
I would say...

4955
03:16:32,470 --> 03:16:34,070
It's very spicy.

4956
03:16:35,710 --> 03:16:40,210
It's like... I still feel the spice on my tongue.

4957
03:16:40,930 --> 03:16:42,370
I still feel it.

4958
03:16:44,230 --> 03:16:45,370
But there's flavor.

4959
03:16:48,490 --> 03:16:49,490
Fuck, okay.

4960
03:16:53,210 --> 03:16:53,810
Oh.

4961
03:16:55,850 --> 03:16:57,570
It's better than the bomb.

4962
03:16:57,870 --> 03:16:59,230
It actually...

4963
03:17:00,170 --> 03:17:00,770
It...

4964
03:17:01,830 --> 03:17:03,870
It... Like, it has flavor.

4965
03:17:03,870 --> 03:17:06,170
Like, that's all I asked for.

4966
03:17:06,530 --> 03:17:07,030
Oh.

4967
03:17:08,890 --> 03:17:10,310
But it's... Oh my gosh.

4968
03:17:10,470 --> 03:17:12,410
It's like... It's like... It's spilling.

4969
03:17:12,850 --> 03:17:15,210
I... I toler... It's... It's... It's very spicy.

4970
03:17:16,090 --> 03:17:16,970
Oh my gosh.

4971
03:17:17,530 --> 03:17:19,730
It's very... Oh my god, I can feel it in my cheeks.

4972
03:17:19,850 --> 03:17:20,390
What the fuck?

4973
03:17:20,610 --> 03:17:22,070
What's wrong with this pepper sauce?

4974
03:17:22,270 --> 03:17:23,650
What's wrong with this sauce?

4975
03:17:24,190 --> 03:17:24,690
Okay.

4976
03:17:27,810 --> 03:17:28,930
It's very spicy.

4977
03:17:30,910 --> 03:17:32,850
But it actually has a nice taste.

4978
03:17:33,870 --> 03:17:35,190
Will I do it again?

4979
03:17:37,510 --> 03:17:38,070
Honestly?

4980
03:17:40,590 --> 03:17:42,990
Honestly, if I have... I don't have enough milk.

4981
03:17:43,170 --> 03:17:44,050
I don't... I don't...

4982
03:17:44,050 --> 03:17:46,850
I literally only have like...

4983
03:17:46,850 --> 03:17:51,310
Two... I like... My milk is like barely done.

4984
03:17:51,630 --> 03:17:54,850
I only have like one more sip of milk left.

4985
03:17:59,650 --> 03:18:02,110
Oh, but... Oh my... Oh my god.

4986
03:18:02,210 --> 03:18:04,050
It's like pinching my cheeks.

4987
03:18:04,910 --> 03:18:08,230
I like feel like the pinch on my cheeks.

4988
03:18:08,690 --> 03:18:09,890
Oh my god.

4989
03:18:11,090 --> 03:18:13,650
It's like... I don't know... Okay.

4990
03:18:13,850 --> 03:18:16,210
It's like those spice that builds up.

4991
03:18:16,410 --> 03:18:19,210
It builds up and it's like pinching.

4992
03:18:19,750 --> 03:18:21,150
It's like pinching.

4993
03:18:21,210 --> 03:18:26,230
I feel like if you don't have the spice tolerance like me...

4994
03:18:27,050 --> 03:18:28,010
You're so fucked.

4995
03:18:28,350 --> 03:18:29,090
Oh my god.

4996
03:18:31,790 --> 03:18:33,630
Like I wouldn't say...

4997
03:18:33,630 --> 03:18:34,770
Like oh my god.

4998
03:18:34,830 --> 03:18:35,970
I'm gonna fucking die.

4999
03:18:36,110 --> 03:18:37,290
That's so fucking spicy.

5000
03:18:37,570 --> 03:18:39,070
I wouldn't say that.

5001
03:18:39,230 --> 03:18:42,770
I would say that I think it's very spicy.

5002
03:18:44,310 --> 03:18:46,890
But it's not like I'm gonna fucking die.

5003
03:18:49,670 --> 03:18:52,630
So if you don't have my spice tolerance...

5004
03:18:52,630 --> 03:18:54,250
You're so fucked.

5005
03:18:54,850 --> 03:19:01,390
Because even I was like damn that like I could feel like the pinching on my cheeks from the spice.

5006
03:19:02,470 --> 03:19:05,370
It's definitely not gonna be doing very well in my stomach.

5007
03:19:05,510 --> 03:19:09,210
Like at least I'm not like mixing all of it like last time.

5008
03:19:09,290 --> 03:19:10,210
That one was bad.

5009
03:19:10,430 --> 03:19:11,670
That was very bad.

5010
03:19:12,030 --> 03:19:14,370
But I would definitely say...

5011
03:19:15,610 --> 03:19:18,110
I grew up with spicy things.

5012
03:19:18,170 --> 03:19:18,970
So I live.

5013
03:19:19,390 --> 03:19:22,210
But like if you don't grow up with spice...

5014
03:19:22,210 --> 03:19:24,210
I don't know what to say.

5015
03:19:24,270 --> 03:19:26,550
I think you'd be pretty fucked anyway when you eat my chicken.

5016
03:19:26,710 --> 03:19:27,630
When you eat my chicken.

5017
03:19:33,490 --> 03:19:33,970
Hmm.

5018
03:19:38,900 --> 03:19:40,040
I deserve this.

5019
03:19:40,640 --> 03:19:42,180
I deserve my chicken.

5020
03:19:42,940 --> 03:19:43,520
Alright.

5021
03:19:46,300 --> 03:19:47,380
Now of course...

5022
03:19:48,160 --> 03:19:50,040
It's a non-sauce chicken.

5023
03:19:51,440 --> 03:19:53,160
I deserve more chicken.

5024
03:19:53,680 --> 03:19:55,380
But like not the spicy one.

5025
03:19:56,660 --> 03:19:58,920
Oh my god my eyes are watering though.

5026
03:19:59,160 --> 03:20:00,060
Holy shit.

5027
03:20:00,460 --> 03:20:04,940
I feel like it's not as fun when I have like the Asian spice tolerance though.

5028
03:20:12,100 --> 03:20:15,740
I have the Asian spice tolerance so like...

5029
03:20:16,270 --> 03:20:16,840
Oh shit.

5030
03:20:16,880 --> 03:20:17,540
Give me a sec guys.

5031
03:20:17,580 --> 03:20:18,600
I need to wash my hands.

5032
03:20:18,820 --> 03:20:20,480
I need to make sure I don't touch my eyes.

5033
03:20:20,600 --> 03:20:21,000
Give me a sec.

5034
03:21:02,230 --> 03:21:03,110
Alright I'm back.

5035
03:21:03,330 --> 03:21:03,750
Alright.

5036
03:21:04,850 --> 03:21:05,910
Alright like I said.

5037
03:21:07,570 --> 03:21:08,930
Fuck the Bamha sauce.

5038
03:21:09,130 --> 03:21:10,870
That shit tasted like metal.

5039
03:21:11,170 --> 03:21:12,670
Like I don't understand.

5040
03:21:13,110 --> 03:21:16,250
They can make perfectly reasonable sauce.

5041
03:21:16,250 --> 03:21:17,090
Sauce.

5042
03:21:17,470 --> 03:21:18,250
Hot sauce.

5043
03:21:18,390 --> 03:21:22,270
That actually tastes like something good.

5044
03:21:23,770 --> 03:21:27,030
But then they made the Bam which is just metal.

5045
03:21:27,310 --> 03:21:29,250
It just actually tastes metal.

5046
03:21:30,250 --> 03:21:32,850
Like the Bam was so fucking bad.

5047
03:21:32,930 --> 03:21:33,590
Holy shit.

5048
03:21:33,790 --> 03:21:35,330
But this one's like actually...

5049
03:21:35,330 --> 03:21:37,790
If it wasn't so fucking hot.

5050
03:21:37,930 --> 03:21:39,450
I would try it again.

5051
03:21:39,630 --> 03:21:40,510
I would try...

5052
03:21:40,510 --> 03:21:41,350
What is it called?

5053
03:21:41,970 --> 03:21:44,510
I would try the last dab experience.

5054
03:21:44,830 --> 03:21:45,230
Yeah.

5055
03:21:46,010 --> 03:21:47,150
If it didn't...

5056
03:21:47,150 --> 03:21:48,490
If it wasn't like...

5057
03:21:48,490 --> 03:21:49,210
I mean...

5058
03:21:49,210 --> 03:21:49,990
Okay to be fair.

5059
03:21:50,090 --> 03:21:52,430
If I had another...

5060
03:21:52,430 --> 03:21:53,610
If I had more milk.

5061
03:21:53,770 --> 03:21:54,790
If I had more milk.

5062
03:21:54,850 --> 03:21:57,710
I will actually do another bite.

5063
03:21:59,070 --> 03:22:02,610
I'll do another chicken for it.

5064
03:22:02,730 --> 03:22:05,070
But like I barely have enough milk for this.

5065
03:22:05,130 --> 03:22:05,950
So it's not worth it.

5066
03:22:06,070 --> 03:22:06,670
It's not...

5067
03:22:06,670 --> 03:22:08,450
It's not worth it.

5068
03:22:12,360 --> 03:22:13,380
So like I wouldn't...

5069
03:22:13,380 --> 03:22:14,320
I wouldn't fucking...

5070
03:22:14,320 --> 03:22:15,140
I wouldn't...

5071
03:22:15,140 --> 03:22:17,480
I would not like push that boundary.

5072
03:22:17,660 --> 03:22:18,140
Alright!

5073
03:22:18,240 --> 03:22:19,600
What's the next stretch goal?

5074
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:20,960
What is it?

5075
03:22:21,440 --> 03:22:24,620
I haven't played a single game.

5076
03:22:24,740 --> 03:22:25,380
I've just been...

5077
03:22:25,380 --> 03:22:30,260
I hope you guys have been entertained.

5078
03:22:30,600 --> 03:22:33,760
Despite the many non-skippable ads.

5079
03:22:34,080 --> 03:22:36,900
I hope you guys have been entertained.

5080
03:22:41,460 --> 03:22:42,140
Alright.

5081
03:22:43,100 --> 03:22:43,620
Okay.

5082
03:22:44,880 --> 03:22:45,920
Okay, let's see.

5083
03:22:46,020 --> 03:22:47,900
What's the next one that is...

5084
03:22:47,900 --> 03:22:48,420
Okay.

5085
03:22:49,060 --> 03:22:49,580
Um...

5086
03:22:50,140 --> 03:22:51,640
Duet cover with Yuuzhan!

5087
03:22:53,040 --> 03:22:54,080
So... um...

5088
03:22:54,080 --> 03:22:57,220
Yuuzhan is totally down to do it.

5089
03:22:57,540 --> 03:23:00,600
They were actually at first down to do it without the charity.

5090
03:23:00,820 --> 03:23:02,840
And then I was like, no, let's do it for charity.

5091
03:23:03,040 --> 03:23:05,440
Because, you know, it's a good cause.

5092
03:23:05,680 --> 03:23:07,800
Let me read... um...

5093
03:23:07,800 --> 03:23:10,260
Okay, so basically... um...

5094
03:23:11,200 --> 03:23:12,120
The duet cover...

5095
03:23:12,140 --> 03:23:13,500
Duet cover with Yuuzhan.

5096
03:23:13,780 --> 03:23:16,240
You guys get to decide what song...

5097
03:23:16,840 --> 03:23:18,040
Um... we can do together.

5098
03:23:18,740 --> 03:23:20,360
Um... and... uh...

5099
03:23:20,660 --> 03:23:22,460
Yuuzhan will be in charge with...

5100
03:23:22,460 --> 03:23:24,120
Getting the mixers...

5101
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:25,700
And the instrumentals.

5102
03:23:25,900 --> 03:23:29,200
And then I will be in charge of finding the artist.

5103
03:23:29,500 --> 03:23:31,300
And the MV editor.

5104
03:23:31,440 --> 03:23:32,340
I will be funding...

5105
03:23:32,720 --> 03:23:34,560
I will be funding the entire video.

5106
03:23:35,100 --> 03:23:36,580
Uh... but... uh...

5107
03:23:36,580 --> 03:23:38,380
But we're like splitting the job.

5108
03:23:38,560 --> 03:23:41,580
So like I will still be paying for the instrumentals and mixers.

5109
03:23:42,160 --> 03:23:43,760
Um... but... um...

5110
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:45,640
But like Yuuzhan will be in charge of finding them.

5111
03:23:45,700 --> 03:23:47,580
Because like, you know, they are a singer.

5112
03:23:47,740 --> 03:23:50,280
And they're much more experienced with that type of thing.

5113
03:23:50,660 --> 03:23:51,680
Um... so...

5114
03:23:51,680 --> 03:23:54,480
We will decide on...

5115
03:23:54,480 --> 03:23:55,420
Um...

5116
03:23:55,700 --> 03:23:57,240
Will you guys get to pick...

5117
03:23:57,760 --> 03:24:00,180
Uh... what duet cover we will do together.

5118
03:24:00,820 --> 03:24:02,480
Um... I will say...

5119
03:24:02,480 --> 03:24:03,380
If...

5120
03:24:03,940 --> 03:24:05,140
You know... um...

5121
03:24:05,140 --> 03:24:07,240
Guys, okay, this is very off topic.

5122
03:24:07,540 --> 03:24:08,780
But one of my fav...

5123
03:24:08,780 --> 03:24:09,560
Hahahaha!

5124
03:24:12,260 --> 03:24:13,020
Hahahaha!

5125
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:16,420
This is super off topic.

5126
03:24:16,760 --> 03:24:18,500
But I don't know if you guys know this.

5127
03:24:18,880 --> 03:24:23,060
But one of my favorite songs is...

5128
03:24:23,060 --> 03:24:25,260
Def should not have taken thee.

5129
03:24:25,960 --> 03:24:26,720
Uh...

5130
03:24:26,720 --> 03:24:27,340
Hahahaha!

5131
03:24:27,400 --> 03:24:27,880
What?

5132
03:24:28,920 --> 03:24:29,300
Hahahaha!

5133
03:24:31,080 --> 03:24:31,840
Hahahaha!

5134
03:24:32,840 --> 03:24:35,940
This is just so off topic guys.

5135
03:24:36,160 --> 03:24:37,880
It's so off topic.

5136
03:24:38,040 --> 03:24:40,360
But I like to say that...

5137
03:24:40,360 --> 03:24:41,020
Um...

5138
03:24:41,020 --> 03:24:42,560
Def should not have taken thee...

5139
03:24:42,560 --> 03:24:45,900
Is honestly one of my favorite...

5140
03:24:45,900 --> 03:24:46,420
Um...

5141
03:24:47,020 --> 03:24:47,920
Uh...

5142
03:24:47,920 --> 03:24:50,140
Duet songs out there.

5143
03:24:50,630 --> 03:24:51,040
But...

5144
03:24:51,690 --> 03:24:52,100
Hahahaha!

5145
03:24:53,480 --> 03:24:54,300
Hahahaha!

5146
03:24:55,780 --> 03:25:01,380
Obviously, this has nothing to do with like the cover with...

5147
03:25:01,670 --> 03:25:02,620
With Yusam.

5148
03:25:02,740 --> 03:25:07,520
But I love, you know, Wonderful Opportunity is like one of my favorite...

5149
03:25:07,520 --> 03:25:09,200
Like JP...

5150
03:25:09,200 --> 03:25:09,860
Um...

5151
03:25:09,860 --> 03:25:11,800
Bookaloid artists.

5152
03:25:12,340 --> 03:25:14,000
And oh my god.

5153
03:25:14,180 --> 03:25:15,800
Hearing like...

5154
03:25:15,800 --> 03:25:16,000
Uh...

5155
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:16,720
Hahahaha!

5156
03:25:17,320 --> 03:25:20,340
All I'm saying is that...

5157
03:25:20,340 --> 03:25:21,500
Oh my god.

5158
03:25:21,620 --> 03:25:24,020
Like you guys should totally...

5159
03:25:24,020 --> 03:25:26,480
Like listen to this song.

5160
03:25:27,260 --> 03:25:28,140
Hahahaha!

5161
03:25:31,140 --> 03:25:32,680
And like...

5162
03:25:32,680 --> 03:25:34,380
Oh...

5163
03:25:34,380 --> 03:25:36,780
It's just such a good song though.

5164
03:25:36,960 --> 03:25:37,800
Right?

5165
03:25:38,240 --> 03:25:39,120
Hahahaha!

5166
03:25:39,120 --> 03:25:39,840
I'm so sorry.

5167
03:25:39,840 --> 03:25:42,980
I got the whole right here, guys.

5168
03:25:42,980 --> 03:25:45,000
That would be great for a second cover, you know?

5169
03:25:45,320 --> 03:25:46,580
That would be great.

5170
03:25:47,460 --> 03:25:48,020
Hahahaha!

5171
03:25:49,880 --> 03:25:50,800
That would be...

5172
03:25:50,800 --> 03:25:51,240
So it's like...

5173
03:25:51,240 --> 03:25:51,900
Oh yeah...

5174
03:25:51,900 --> 03:25:53,480
Like for your second cover, right?

5175
03:25:53,600 --> 03:25:54,240
Like wow.

5176
03:25:54,520 --> 03:25:54,760
Yeah!

5177
03:25:59,500 --> 03:26:00,220
I'm just...

5178
03:26:00,220 --> 03:26:00,980
I'm just saying.

5179
03:26:01,140 --> 03:26:01,740
I'm just saying.

5180
03:26:02,400 --> 03:26:04,000
It's so off topic anyway.

5181
03:26:04,540 --> 03:26:05,100
Anyway...

5182
03:26:05,100 --> 03:26:05,600
As I...

5183
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:06,480
Anyway...

5184
03:26:06,480 --> 03:26:08,320
It's super off topic though.

5185
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:09,960
But like...

5186
03:26:09,960 --> 03:26:10,360
What...

5187
03:26:10,360 --> 03:26:10,620
What...

5188
03:26:10,620 --> 03:26:11,380
What are your...

5189
03:26:11,380 --> 03:26:14,560
What songs do you guys want Yussan and I to...

5190
03:26:14,560 --> 03:26:17,280
What songs do you guys want Yussan and I to do?

5191
03:26:23,380 --> 03:26:26,820
Yes, yeah.

5192
03:26:26,980 --> 03:26:29,640
What suggestions do you guys have?

5193
03:26:30,140 --> 03:26:32,040
Okay, we cannot do Free Bird.

5194
03:26:32,200 --> 03:26:35,260
Because they already demonetized me the first time.

5195
03:26:35,460 --> 03:26:37,920
So I refuse to do Free Bird.

5196
03:26:39,420 --> 03:26:47,300
They already... Free Bird has generated enough revenue off of my first stream back.

5197
03:26:47,700 --> 03:26:56,040
Like, they have... I will veto Free Bird just because they've already generated enough income from that stream.

5198
03:26:59,720 --> 03:27:04,500
So I... I will veto Free Bird because of it.

5199
03:27:04,620 --> 03:27:06,220
I heard Roki.

5200
03:27:06,460 --> 03:27:07,520
Roki is a nice song.

5201
03:27:07,920 --> 03:27:11,900
Roki is a great song too for... for a cover.

5202
03:27:12,700 --> 03:27:13,860
Alright, Roki.

5203
03:27:14,280 --> 03:27:16,620
What other suggestions do you guys have?

5204
03:27:16,700 --> 03:27:20,360
We will have a poll with four choices just like last time.

5205
03:27:20,560 --> 03:27:27,520
And then you guys can vote for the one you guys want to hear the most.

5206
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:34,980
Oh my god, why are you guys suggesting the fucking hardest songs that I would never be able to sing?

5207
03:27:36,880 --> 03:27:37,840
Like... guys!

5208
03:27:37,920 --> 03:27:39,700
You guys would sound amazing!

5209
03:27:40,780 --> 03:27:43,180
But you guys have to remember...

5210
03:27:43,180 --> 03:27:45,480
I am also singing it.

5211
03:27:45,980 --> 03:27:49,120
Like... I am also singing it.

5212
03:27:49,960 --> 03:27:50,680
Like...

5213
03:27:50,680 --> 03:27:52,260
What was it?

5214
03:27:53,700 --> 03:27:54,420
Usai?

5215
03:27:54,640 --> 03:27:56,760
Is that the... Is that how you pronounce it?

5216
03:27:57,060 --> 03:28:01,180
Like that... There is no fucking way I would be able to sing that.

5217
03:28:05,740 --> 03:28:06,780
Holy fuck.

5218
03:28:06,780 --> 03:28:08,580
You guys always sound amazing.

5219
03:28:15,220 --> 03:28:15,900
Alright.

5220
03:28:16,740 --> 03:28:18,040
Okay, let's see.

5221
03:28:18,640 --> 03:28:19,320
Oh!

5222
03:28:19,580 --> 03:28:20,260
Bro!

5223
03:28:20,680 --> 03:28:21,360
Thunderwear!

5224
03:28:21,520 --> 03:28:23,720
I like Death Should Not Have Taken Thee.

5225
03:28:23,820 --> 03:28:26,200
That is such a good suggestion.

5226
03:28:32,600 --> 03:28:33,280
Thunder!

5227
03:28:33,280 --> 03:28:33,960
Wow!

5228
03:28:34,680 --> 03:28:36,740
Thank you for suggesting that.

5229
03:28:36,900 --> 03:28:39,200
That is a really good suggestion.

5230
03:28:39,200 --> 03:28:41,040
For a song cover.

5231
03:28:41,380 --> 03:28:42,560
Oh my god.

5232
03:28:47,280 --> 03:28:48,380
What do you mean?

5233
03:28:48,480 --> 03:28:50,060
I was reading off chat!

5234
03:28:50,900 --> 03:28:51,420
Guys!

5235
03:28:51,560 --> 03:28:52,680
It's not rigged!

5236
03:28:52,680 --> 03:28:54,060
I was literally reading off chat!

5237
03:28:54,880 --> 03:28:55,400
Guys...

5238
03:28:55,400 --> 03:28:56,060
I don't know why...

5239
03:28:56,060 --> 03:28:56,720
I was...

5240
03:28:56,720 --> 03:28:58,180
I was reading off chat.

5241
03:28:58,320 --> 03:28:59,320
I don't know what you are talking about.

5242
03:28:59,780 --> 03:29:00,760
I literally...

5243
03:29:00,760 --> 03:29:02,580
Someone really wanted me to sing that.

5244
03:29:02,860 --> 03:29:03,780
Oh my god.

5245
03:29:03,800 --> 03:29:04,460
Thank you, Ma.

5246
03:29:04,660 --> 03:29:06,340
Just for linking that song.

5247
03:29:06,920 --> 03:29:07,440
That...

5248
03:29:07,440 --> 03:29:08,240
That is...

5249
03:29:08,240 --> 03:29:10,280
That is a good suggestion.

5250
03:29:10,700 --> 03:29:11,260
I would...

5251
03:29:12,400 --> 03:29:13,120
I...

5252
03:29:13,120 --> 03:29:16,060
I would gladly put that on the poll.

5253
03:29:16,460 --> 03:29:18,220
Paid out after...

5254
03:29:23,020 --> 03:29:25,560
I don't know what you are talking about.

5255
03:29:25,680 --> 03:29:26,560
I was just...

5256
03:29:26,560 --> 03:29:28,760
I was just reading off of the chat!

5257
03:29:29,080 --> 03:29:29,800
Guys!

5258
03:29:30,380 --> 03:29:31,800
What do you mean?

5259
03:29:32,180 --> 03:29:35,120
Everything was just read off of chat.

5260
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:36,220
Alright.

5261
03:29:36,340 --> 03:29:36,880
Okay.

5262
03:29:41,660 --> 03:29:42,220
Guys.

5263
03:29:42,220 --> 03:29:42,340
It's Il Jon.

5264
03:29:42,340 --> 03:29:42,400
It's Il Jon.

5265
03:29:42,400 --> 03:29:44,600
Oh wow!何 legitimacy.

5266
03:29:49,810 --> 03:29:52,870
Bro, there's no way I can sing that song!

5267
03:29:53,070 --> 03:29:53,330
lol.

5268
03:29:53,430 --> 03:29:53,990
No.

5269
03:29:54,090 --> 03:29:59,650
There's no way I can sing the last... Oh my god.

5270
03:30:02,770 --> 03:30:03,330
Ok...

5271
03:30:03,330 --> 03:30:07,530
Now there're songs that like I can actually be able to sing.

5272
03:30:08,550 --> 03:30:09,550
Guys... Guys!

5273
03:30:09,550 --> 03:30:10,550
I mean we can also do like...

5274
03:30:12,430 --> 03:30:13,030
Ummm...

5275
03:30:13,670 --> 03:30:14,190
Alright...

5276
03:30:14,190 --> 03:30:15,650
Guys, please...

5277
03:30:15,650 --> 03:30:17,770
Within my vocal range...

5278
03:30:17,770 --> 03:30:18,170
Chat...

5279
03:30:18,170 --> 03:30:20,410
I know you guys think I am very talented.

5280
03:30:20,770 --> 03:30:21,690
But like...

5281
03:30:21,690 --> 03:30:23,450
There's some things that I know...

5282
03:30:23,450 --> 03:30:23,830
I know...

5283
03:30:23,830 --> 03:30:24,070
I...

5284
03:30:24,070 --> 03:30:26,330
I really hate to break it to you.

5285
03:30:26,490 --> 03:30:27,230
But like...

5286
03:30:27,230 --> 03:30:28,350
I'm not perfect.

5287
03:30:28,570 --> 03:30:29,170
I know...

5288
03:30:29,170 --> 03:30:29,610
I...

5289
03:30:29,610 --> 03:30:30,270
I'm sorry!

5290
03:30:30,470 --> 03:30:31,530
I'm so sorry!

5291
03:30:31,750 --> 03:30:31,910
I...

5292
03:30:31,910 --> 03:30:33,370
I know it's great!

5293
03:30:33,530 --> 03:30:33,770
I...

5294
03:30:33,770 --> 03:30:35,090
I didn't want to say this.

5295
03:30:36,250 --> 03:30:36,850
But...

5296
03:30:37,630 --> 03:30:38,270
I am...

5297
03:30:39,550 --> 03:30:41,030
I'm not perfect.

5298
03:30:48,230 --> 03:30:49,070
I...

5299
03:30:49,070 --> 03:30:50,090
I...

5300
03:30:50,090 --> 03:30:50,290
I...

5301
03:30:50,290 --> 03:30:50,310
I...

5302
03:30:50,310 --> 03:30:50,330
I...

5303
03:30:50,330 --> 03:30:50,510
I'm sorry!

5304
03:30:51,050 --> 03:30:52,190
I'm so sorry!

5305
03:30:52,930 --> 03:30:54,370
There have limitations!

5306
03:30:56,090 --> 03:30:59,330
I have limitations when it comes to singing!

5307
03:31:01,590 --> 03:31:03,470
I'm so sorry!

5308
03:31:04,210 --> 03:31:06,770
I didn't want to tell you this!

5309
03:31:07,310 --> 03:31:08,690
But I had to...

5310
03:31:08,690 --> 03:31:09,170
Before...

5311
03:31:09,170 --> 03:31:09,930
Oh, it's too late.

5312
03:31:10,470 --> 03:31:11,550
I'm sick.

5313
03:31:12,880 --> 03:31:14,010
Now the immersion!

5314
03:31:14,750 --> 03:31:17,790
You were supposed to be perfect Doki!

5315
03:31:18,410 --> 03:31:20,290
How could this happen?

5316
03:31:26,290 --> 03:31:26,990
Ponyo!

5317
03:31:27,110 --> 03:31:27,470
Okay.

5318
03:31:27,750 --> 03:31:28,990
I like that.

5319
03:31:34,250 --> 03:31:37,350
Oh my god, I can sing like the English cover too.

5320
03:31:37,350 --> 03:31:40,230
I don't know if you someone want to do that.

5321
03:31:43,670 --> 03:31:48,890
I love that song so much though.

5322
03:31:49,110 --> 03:31:50,050
Holy shit.

5323
03:31:50,090 --> 03:31:50,250
Alright.

5324
03:31:50,390 --> 03:31:50,790
Okay.

5325
03:31:51,090 --> 03:31:51,690
Nice.

5326
03:31:51,850 --> 03:31:53,110
Drop Pop Candy!

5327
03:31:53,550 --> 03:31:53,890
Wait!

5328
03:31:54,070 --> 03:31:55,970
Drop Pop Candy is pretty nice too.

5329
03:31:56,310 --> 03:31:56,910
Fuck!

5330
03:31:57,010 --> 03:31:57,290
Okay!

5331
03:31:57,530 --> 03:31:58,670
Drop Pop Candy.

5332
03:31:59,210 --> 03:31:59,810
Okay.

5333
03:32:00,730 --> 03:32:06,090
I'm sorry, but like my favorite version of Drop Pop Candy has to...

5334
03:32:08,930 --> 03:32:14,950
Okay, but like have you guys heard the Undertale version of Drop Pop Candy?

5335
03:32:17,050 --> 03:32:28,010
All I'm saying is that, not gonna lie, the Undertale version of Drop Pop Candy is pretty fire.

5336
03:32:28,330 --> 03:32:30,890
It's pretty fucking fire.

5337
03:32:31,330 --> 03:32:33,830
I mean, come on!

5338
03:32:35,730 --> 03:32:37,030
It's pretty good!

5339
03:32:37,710 --> 03:32:40,170
Like... it's pretty good.

5340
03:32:40,790 --> 03:32:41,350
Wait!

5341
03:32:42,010 --> 03:32:43,910
Okay, but what if we do...

5342
03:32:45,310 --> 03:32:48,810
The... Oh wait, but I don't know if Yu-san can sing in Chinese.

5343
03:32:49,130 --> 03:32:50,370
What am I saying?

5344
03:32:56,950 --> 03:32:58,210
I don't know.

5345
03:32:58,270 --> 03:33:01,170
I don't know if Yu-san can sing in Chinese.

5346
03:33:01,170 --> 03:33:02,250
Maybe not.

5347
03:33:02,510 --> 03:33:03,970
Cause I was like, oh hey, I need this.

5348
03:33:03,990 --> 03:33:04,910
That's a duet too.

5349
03:33:05,210 --> 03:33:06,090
That's a duet.

5350
03:33:06,990 --> 03:33:07,430
No!

5351
03:33:07,550 --> 03:33:09,310
I don't think Yu-san can sing in Chinese!

5352
03:33:11,950 --> 03:33:14,090
There's no... I feel like... I don't know.

5353
03:33:20,570 --> 03:33:21,250
Let's see.

5354
03:33:22,730 --> 03:33:23,710
I'm trying to think.

5355
03:33:23,770 --> 03:33:24,010
Okay.

5356
03:33:24,190 --> 03:33:24,590
Okay.

5357
03:33:24,970 --> 03:33:25,410
Alright.

5358
03:33:25,510 --> 03:33:26,470
How about...

5359
03:33:27,770 --> 03:33:29,250
Dream... Dream Pop Candy?

5360
03:33:29,250 --> 03:33:30,570
Wait, was it Dream Pop Candy?

5361
03:33:30,870 --> 03:33:32,010
I don't really... I don't remember.

5362
03:33:32,070 --> 03:33:32,510
Was it...

5363
03:33:32,510 --> 03:33:33,610
Dream Pop Candy?

5364
03:33:35,070 --> 03:33:35,510
Uh...

5365
03:33:38,910 --> 03:33:39,350
Uh...

5366
03:33:41,310 --> 03:33:41,750
Uh...

5367
03:33:43,490 --> 03:33:44,870
That should not have taken thee.

5368
03:33:46,090 --> 03:33:47,970
Which, by the way, I think...

5369
03:33:47,970 --> 03:33:50,410
If Yu-san and I did that...

5370
03:33:51,830 --> 03:33:52,270
Song...

5371
03:33:52,270 --> 03:33:54,670
It would be... It would sound so good.

5372
03:33:55,010 --> 03:33:55,210
Okay.

5373
03:33:55,450 --> 03:33:55,890
Okay.

5374
03:34:00,230 --> 03:34:02,310
I'm saying...

5375
03:34:02,310 --> 03:34:03,130
All I'm saying...

5376
03:34:03,130 --> 03:34:07,230
All I'm saying...

5377
03:34:07,230 --> 03:34:07,770
Okay.

5378
03:34:08,190 --> 03:34:08,830
Okay.

5379
03:34:09,090 --> 03:34:09,890
Alright.

5380
03:34:09,990 --> 03:34:10,270
Anyway.

5381
03:34:11,110 --> 03:34:12,890
Duet cover.

5382
03:34:13,510 --> 03:34:14,590
With...

5383
03:34:15,390 --> 03:34:17,910
With Yu-san.

5384
03:34:19,030 --> 03:34:21,330
That should not have taken thee.

5385
03:34:23,310 --> 03:34:24,390
Uh...

5386
03:34:24,390 --> 03:34:26,070
This sounds like, please stop.

5387
03:34:27,330 --> 03:34:27,850
Uh...

5388
03:34:27,850 --> 03:34:28,870
Was it Drop Pop?

5389
03:34:29,010 --> 03:34:30,070
I don't even remember if it's...

5390
03:34:30,070 --> 03:34:30,810
It's Drop Pop.

5391
03:34:30,970 --> 03:34:31,130
Yeah.

5392
03:34:31,190 --> 03:34:32,690
Oh, it's a Dream Pop Candy.

5393
03:34:34,290 --> 03:34:34,810
Okay.

5394
03:34:34,870 --> 03:34:35,850
Drop Pop Candy.

5395
03:34:37,430 --> 03:34:37,950
Rookie.

5396
03:34:39,830 --> 03:34:40,530
You know what?

5397
03:34:40,550 --> 03:34:41,230
We'll do these three.

5398
03:34:41,570 --> 03:34:42,630
Ponyo can be...

5399
03:34:42,630 --> 03:34:45,090
I feel like Ponyo wouldn't really fit, to be fair.

5400
03:34:45,590 --> 03:34:46,470
Uh... Alright.

5401
03:34:46,550 --> 03:34:46,970
Here we go.

5402
03:34:48,230 --> 03:34:48,750
Choose.

5403
03:34:53,380 --> 03:34:53,900
Choose.

5404
03:34:54,200 --> 03:34:55,220
It is time.

5405
03:34:55,220 --> 03:34:58,360
It is time...

5406
03:34:58,360 --> 03:34:59,400
It is time...

5407
03:34:59,400 --> 03:34:59,900
To pick.

5408
03:35:01,100 --> 03:35:02,160
Oh my God.

5409
03:35:02,540 --> 03:35:03,240
Who...

5410
03:35:11,310 --> 03:35:12,190
Who...

5411
03:35:14,790 --> 03:35:15,230
Guys!

5412
03:35:15,610 --> 03:35:16,630
Oh my God!

5413
03:35:17,270 --> 03:35:19,110
I can't believe it!

5414
03:35:23,430 --> 03:35:24,310
Guys!

5415
03:35:25,470 --> 03:35:28,950
I can't believe that should not have taken thee!

5416
03:35:28,950 --> 03:35:30,570
Is winning the vote!

5417
03:35:35,230 --> 03:35:37,230
Don't let her win, guys.

5418
03:35:38,050 --> 03:35:39,290
Holy shit!

5419
03:35:40,230 --> 03:35:42,010
I'm so surprised!

5420
03:35:43,570 --> 03:35:44,270
Guys!

5421
03:35:44,270 --> 03:35:45,330
Oh my God!

5422
03:35:45,470 --> 03:35:46,910
This is actually insane!

5423
03:35:47,270 --> 03:35:48,510
Who would have thought?

5424
03:35:50,230 --> 03:35:53,270
Can we go on straight?

5425
03:35:53,550 --> 03:35:54,270
You know, guys!

5426
03:35:54,510 --> 03:35:55,190
Guys!

5427
03:35:55,690 --> 03:35:56,390
Um...

5428
03:35:56,390 --> 03:35:57,510
I will give you...

5429
03:35:57,510 --> 03:36:00,290
I will give the poll to be up for, you know...

5430
03:36:00,290 --> 03:36:02,550
Maybe like two more minutes.

5431
03:36:02,850 --> 03:36:03,630
You know...

5432
03:36:03,630 --> 03:36:05,670
I mean one more minute.

5433
03:36:07,170 --> 03:36:08,190
Sorry, fellas.

5434
03:36:08,410 --> 03:36:09,590
I've got a sip.

5435
03:36:09,930 --> 03:36:11,010
Thank you, Keith.

5436
03:36:11,130 --> 03:36:13,830
That's why you're my favorite.

5437
03:36:15,290 --> 03:36:16,170
Alright, guys.

5438
03:36:16,490 --> 03:36:17,370
Oh my God!

5439
03:36:17,410 --> 03:36:20,170
It seems we're almost a minute up!

5440
03:36:20,570 --> 03:36:21,090
Guys!

5441
03:36:21,330 --> 03:36:21,770
Whoa!

5442
03:36:22,290 --> 03:36:23,490
Alright, don't worry, everybody.

5443
03:36:23,670 --> 03:36:24,530
I will do a little countdown.

5444
03:36:24,950 --> 03:36:25,630
I'll do it...

5445
03:36:25,630 --> 03:36:26,250
Guys, it's okay.

5446
03:36:26,250 --> 03:36:27,330
I'm gonna do a little countdown.

5447
03:36:27,470 --> 03:36:29,750
So we all know that this is all fair.

5448
03:36:29,990 --> 03:36:31,090
It's the fair vote, guys.

5449
03:36:31,350 --> 03:36:32,470
Just so you guys know.

5450
03:36:33,150 --> 03:36:33,590
Damn!

5451
03:36:34,070 --> 03:36:35,390
Oh, I can't believe we're doing...

5452
03:36:35,390 --> 03:36:36,650
I can't believe we're doing this song!

5453
03:36:37,830 --> 03:36:40,770
How do you guys know this was one of my favorite chat?

5454
03:36:41,670 --> 03:36:44,430
How did you know this was one of my favorite songs?

5455
03:36:45,970 --> 03:36:46,410
Oh my God!

5456
03:36:51,030 --> 03:36:52,550
That's fucking crazy!

5457
03:36:53,490 --> 03:36:55,090
I'll do a countdown, everybody.

5458
03:36:55,090 --> 03:36:57,390
So you can get your last minute votes in.

5459
03:36:57,630 --> 03:36:58,230
Ten!

5460
03:37:00,070 --> 03:37:00,670
Nine!

5461
03:37:02,170 --> 03:37:02,770
Eight!

5462
03:37:03,930 --> 03:37:04,530
Seven!

5463
03:37:05,870 --> 03:37:06,170
Six!

5464
03:37:07,250 --> 03:37:07,850
Five!

5465
03:37:08,850 --> 03:37:09,450
Four!

5466
03:37:10,610 --> 03:37:11,210
Three!

5467
03:37:12,470 --> 03:37:13,070
Two!

5468
03:37:15,070 --> 03:37:15,670
Look!

5469
03:37:15,850 --> 03:37:17,210
I'll even give you guys more time!

5470
03:37:17,450 --> 03:37:18,310
Two and a half!

5471
03:37:19,030 --> 03:37:20,130
Two and three quarters!

5472
03:37:21,010 --> 03:37:22,010
Two and five quarters!

5473
03:37:22,310 --> 03:37:24,330
I don't think that's how math works.

5474
03:37:24,330 --> 03:37:25,250
One!

5475
03:37:26,630 --> 03:37:27,370
Whoa!

5476
03:37:28,250 --> 03:37:29,650
Zero!

5477
03:37:33,970 --> 03:37:36,090
Oh my God!

5478
03:37:36,790 --> 03:37:39,110
Dev shouldn't have taken me!

5479
03:37:43,550 --> 03:37:46,750
Oh my God!

5480
03:37:50,410 --> 03:37:51,810
Well...

5481
03:37:53,150 --> 03:37:56,030
If you guys say so...

5482
03:37:56,030 --> 03:37:57,550
I guess...

5483
03:37:57,550 --> 03:38:03,890
I guess we're gonna do this song!

5484
03:38:09,620 --> 03:38:11,290
Oh my God!

5485
03:38:12,480 --> 03:38:14,010
I can't believe it!

5486
03:38:14,190 --> 03:38:15,130
I can't...

5487
03:38:15,480 --> 03:38:17,970
I can't believe...

5488
03:38:17,970 --> 03:38:19,450
Dev should not take anyone!

5489
03:38:20,770 --> 03:38:21,790
Two and...

5490
03:38:22,590 --> 03:38:23,430
Four!

5491
03:38:23,590 --> 03:38:24,430
Five!

5492
03:38:28,030 --> 03:38:28,870
Six!

5493
03:38:29,050 --> 03:38:29,250
Seven!

5494
03:38:32,050 --> 03:38:32,890
Nine!

5495
03:38:34,050 --> 03:38:34,890
Ten!

5496
03:38:35,210 --> 03:38:35,230
One!

5497
03:38:35,230 --> 03:38:35,330
Three!

5498
03:38:35,690 --> 03:38:36,530
One!

5499
03:38:36,710 --> 03:38:36,730

5500
03:38:37,090 --> 03:38:37,930

5501
03:38:38,170 --> 03:38:39,010

03:38:39,010 --> 03:38:39,830

5503
03:38:39,830 --> 03:38:40,670

5504
03:38:40,950 --> 03:38:41,790
Two!

5505
03:38:43,630 --> 03:38:44,470
One!

5506
03:38:46,410 --> 03:38:47,250
Two!

5507
03:38:47,250 --> 03:38:47,390
Three!

5508
03:38:47,390 --> 03:38:49,050
It feels just like Helldivers, too!

5509
03:38:53,000 --> 03:38:54,400
Oh my God...

5510
03:38:54,400 --> 03:38:55,520
vì còn actanter không 뉴스 I love that.

5511
03:38:55,920 --> 03:38:56,940
I love managed democracy!

5512
03:39:00,020 --> 03:39:00,580
Okay!

5513
03:39:02,080 --> 03:39:02,840

5514
03:39:03,020 --> 03:39:03,560
All right!

5515
03:39:03,580 --> 03:39:03,840

03:39:24,220 --> 03:39:29,460
The art of tomato bikini is winning the poll.

5526
03:39:29,660 --> 03:39:31,120

Yep, it is.

Yep, it's the most- It's the most liked at the moment.

5530
03:39:36,400 --> 03:39:40,140
That is the current profile picture that has the most likes.

5531
03:39:44,160 --> 03:39:46,100
People are gonna be so fucking confused.

5532
03:39:46,740 --> 03:39:50,580
They're gonna be so fucking confused.

5533
03:39:51,020 --> 03:39:53,880
Alright, the next- The next one.

5534

Alright.

Let's see.

5536
03:40:03,880 --> 03:40:07,720
Oh my god, I've been streaming for like almost four hours.

5537
03:40:07,800 --> 03:40:12,340
That's like- I feel like that- No, five hours has been the longest I've ever streamed because of Batman.

5538
03:40:14,120 --> 03:40:14,680
Okay.

5539
03:40:14,680 --> 03:40:15,240
Okay.

5540
03:40:15,740 --> 03:40:16,480
Let's see.

5541
03:40:17,040 --> 03:40:19,860

5543
03:40:22,640 --> 03:40:23,520
What is it?

5544
03:40:24,040 --> 03:40:27,940
Chat decides the next outfit- Oh, sorry.

5545
03:40:28,960 --> 03:40:29,940
Outfit themed.

5546
03:40:30,640 --> 03:40:32,780
Four hour long ad!

5547
03:40:33,640 --> 03:40:35,680
I am trying my best here!

5548
03:40:37,260 --> 03:40:41,400
Oh my god.

5549
03:40:43,660 --> 03:40:44,420
Okay.

5550
03:40:44,660 --> 03:40:45,260
Okay.

5551
03:40:45,460 --> 03:40:46,140

5552
03:40:47,200 --> 03:40:47,960
Anyway.

5553
03:40:48,440 --> 03:40:51,360
It could have been a five hour long ad, chat.

5554
03:40:51,720 --> 03:40:54,860
It could have been a five hour long ad!

5555
03:40:59,840 --> 03:41:00,600
Okay.

5556
03:41:00,600 --> 03:41:01,360

5557
03:41:03,720 --> 03:41:04,200
Anyway.

5558
03:41:04,300 --> 03:41:05,660
As I was saying.

5559
03:41:06,300 --> 03:41:10,700
The next- Chat gets to pick the next outfit themed.

5560
03:41:12,040 --> 03:41:12,520
Um...

5561
03:41:13,940 --> 03:41:15,680
New exist- Okay, guys.

5562
03:41:15,760 --> 03:41:16,000

Okay.

5565
03:41:19,200 --> 03:41:19,680
Uh...

5566
03:41:19,680 --> 03:41:22,420
I will give you guys four choices to pick.

5567
03:41:22,960 --> 03:41:25,140
I see alternative themed.

5568
03:41:25,760 --> 03:41:27,660
Uh, that one's an official outfit already.

5569
03:41:27,740 --> 03:41:33,880
Like, it's not really- I guess like- I guess if you want to see me with that skin suit on.

5570
03:41:34,540 --> 03:41:35,100
Um...

5571
03:41:35,100 --> 03:41:35,540
Okay.

5572
03:41:35,820 --> 03:41:38,800
One is the alternative girl doki.

5573
03:41:38,940 --> 03:41:40,720
The alt- The alt girl doki.

5574
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:42,800
The other one is- Okay.

5575
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:44,440
I'm trying to see if there's another one.

5576
03:41:44,960 --> 03:41:45,520
Tomboy.

5577
03:41:45,620 --> 03:41:46,180
Okay.

5578
03:41:46,240 --> 03:41:47,120
Tomboy themed.

5579
03:41:47,840 --> 03:41:48,400
Alright.

5580
03:41:48,720 --> 03:41:49,600
What's the third?

5581
03:41:51,100 --> 03:41:52,900
There's two more choices for you guys.

5582
03:41:53,540 --> 03:41:54,300
Magical girl!

5583
03:41:55,040 --> 03:41:55,600
Okay.

5584
03:41:55,600 --> 03:41:56,420
Magical girl.

5585
03:41:56,880 --> 03:41:57,800
What's the fourth?

5586
03:41:59,040 --> 03:42:07,340
I'm trying to see which one has the- Which one- I'm trying to see which one is gonna- Um...

5587
03:42:09,180 --> 03:42:09,800
Which one?

5588
03:42:09,960 --> 03:42:10,960
The fourth, guys.

5589
03:42:11,400 --> 03:42:12,120
The fourth!

5590
03:42:12,580 --> 03:42:14,120
Or there's gonna be only three!

5591
03:42:17,640 --> 03:42:18,120
Alright.

5592
03:42:20,960 --> 03:42:22,620
You only have three, guys!

5593
03:42:23,500 --> 03:42:25,540
A lot of you guys are like different!

5594
03:42:26,440 --> 03:42:26,920
Steampunk?

5595
03:42:27,100 --> 03:42:28,040
Steampunk would be like- That would be interesting.

5596
03:42:28,580 --> 03:42:29,140
Actually.

5597
03:42:29,420 --> 03:42:30,620
That would be an interesting one.

5598
03:42:30,800 --> 03:42:31,120
Okay.

5599
03:42:31,320 --> 03:42:33,460
I'm gonna put the poll up now.

5600
03:42:34,160 --> 03:42:34,900
Another poll.

5601
03:42:35,240 --> 03:42:36,620
Next outfit themed.

5602
03:42:37,680 --> 03:42:38,240
Next...

5603
03:42:39,540 --> 03:42:40,380
outfit themed.

5604
03:42:43,740 --> 03:42:44,300
Ummmm...

5605
03:42:46,120 --> 03:42:46,680
Okay.

5606
03:42:47,020 --> 03:42:47,620
Alt girl.

5607
03:42:48,260 --> 03:42:48,820
Uhhh...

5608
03:42:48,820 --> 03:42:50,260
What was the- Ah!

5609
03:42:50,420 --> 03:42:51,360
Magical girl.

5610
03:42:52,360 --> 03:42:52,920
Tomboy.

5611
03:42:54,240 --> 03:42:56,500
And then the next one- What was the last one?

5612
03:42:56,680 --> 03:42:56,960
Okay.

5613
03:42:57,780 --> 03:42:58,180
Steampunk?

5614
03:42:58,980 --> 03:42:59,380
Steampunk.

5615
03:42:59,420 --> 03:42:59,640
Okay.

5616
03:42:59,660 --> 03:42:59,980
Here we go.

5617
03:43:03,050 --> 03:43:03,450
Alright.

5618
03:43:03,510 --> 03:43:04,470
We'll put that for ten minutes.

5619
03:43:11,210 --> 03:43:14,150
This one has the privilege of having ten minutes.

5620
03:43:19,590 --> 03:43:20,910
This is wrong!

5621
03:43:23,770 --> 03:43:26,470
It's just like the- Just like the last poll, you know?

5622
03:43:26,470 --> 03:43:28,950
The last poll had ten minutes as well.

5623
03:43:29,250 --> 03:43:29,630
Guys!

5624
03:43:29,930 --> 03:43:41,670
I don't- I mean, the last poll also had the equal amount of time as- as the current poll.

5625
03:43:43,470 --> 03:43:44,190
So...

5626
03:43:44,190 --> 03:43:45,070
Oh my god.

5627
03:43:45,170 --> 03:43:52,670
Tomboy is like so fucking- It's so- It's so ahead.

5628
03:43:52,910 --> 03:43:54,210
I honestly am surprised.

5629
03:43:54,210 --> 03:43:58,970
I'm surprised because like I thought you guys would want the the other one.

5630
03:43:59,290 --> 03:44:02,850
But magical girl had- They're the loudest.

5631
03:44:02,950 --> 03:44:06,730
The old girl is like the loudest speakers in chat.

5632
03:44:07,050 --> 03:44:13,030
But like the quiet- The quiet majority are for tomboys.

5633
03:44:15,910 --> 03:44:17,330
I just found it funny.

5634
03:44:17,330 --> 03:44:19,370
The quiet majority right there.

5635
03:44:22,150 --> 03:44:25,810
Alright, Let me look at the next stretch goals.

5636
03:44:26,250 --> 03:44:27,730
The next one.

5637
03:44:29,310 --> 03:44:30,350
Let's see.

5638
03:44:30,870 --> 03:44:31,190
...

5639
03:44:31,190 --> 03:44:32,010
...

5640
03:44:33,890 --> 03:44:43,190
I think like the voice pack theme, I would do that on the community post for everybody to decide because like- That is like a lot.

5641
03:44:43,330 --> 03:44:45,390
That is a lot to talk about.

5642
03:44:45,390 --> 03:44:55,470
So the voice pack and the bento one will be done... will be done a separate in the community post.

5643
03:44:55,810 --> 03:44:58,690
And we'll do that another time for that.

5644
03:44:59,270 --> 03:45:01,190
What else?

5645
03:45:02,210 --> 03:45:03,430
What else do we have?

5646
03:45:03,550 --> 03:45:04,010
Let's see.

5647
03:45:04,090 --> 03:45:08,590
Does anyone know how much we made in total from the auction?

5648
03:45:09,670 --> 03:45:11,170
Can anyone let me know?

5649
03:45:11,230 --> 03:45:12,450
I need to know what goals we've hit.

5650
03:45:12,450 --> 03:45:15,870
I need to know what goals we're at right now.

5651
03:45:17,550 --> 03:45:21,170
Guys, I need my human calculators.

5652
03:45:21,790 --> 03:45:22,670
This is it.

5653
03:45:23,310 --> 03:45:25,030
This is your time to shine.

5654
03:45:26,850 --> 03:45:27,890
71,000.

5655
03:45:27,890 --> 03:45:28,710
Holy fuck.

5656
03:45:28,950 --> 03:45:33,510
We made 71... we're at 130k.

5657
03:45:33,650 --> 03:45:35,910
Okay, let me look at this right now.

5658
03:45:38,350 --> 03:45:38,870
130k.

5659
03:45:40,210 --> 03:45:41,250
Okay, 150.

5660
03:45:42,450 --> 03:45:45,110
We get the... we get...

5661
03:45:45,110 --> 03:45:47,930
My human dad will stream on his PS5.

5662
03:45:49,770 --> 03:45:53,850
So we've currently hit... okay, we have... okay, we've done the Twitter profile.

5663
03:45:54,170 --> 03:45:56,550
We've announced... we've done that, we've done that.

5664
03:45:56,910 --> 03:45:57,910
We've done that.

5665
03:45:58,250 --> 03:45:59,170
We've done that.

5666
03:46:00,170 --> 03:46:02,950
I need to keep track of everything I've done.

5667
03:46:03,190 --> 03:46:06,970
I can't believe I did so many things already and it's only been four hours.

5668
03:46:09,650 --> 03:46:10,170
We've...

5669
03:46:10,910 --> 03:46:11,430
Uh...

5670
03:46:11,430 --> 03:46:12,010
We've...

5671
03:46:12,450 --> 03:46:13,050
We did the hot sauce.

5672
03:46:13,350 --> 03:46:14,010
We did that.

5673
03:46:14,390 --> 03:46:15,410
I can get...

5674
03:46:15,410 --> 03:46:18,970
I'm so... I can get Forklift certified.

5675
03:46:20,210 --> 03:46:20,730
Um...

5676
03:46:22,410 --> 03:46:22,930
Okay.

5677
03:46:24,030 --> 03:46:24,550
If...

5678
03:46:25,270 --> 03:46:27,690
Ditto and I already talked about what song we're doing.

5679
03:46:28,090 --> 03:46:30,010
That one chat goes on the side, guys.

5680
03:46:30,210 --> 03:46:32,570
We already figured out what chat... what song we're doing.

5681
03:46:32,670 --> 03:46:35,010
If we hit 60k...

5682
03:46:35,010 --> 03:46:41,550
If we hit 60k on the Tiltify, I'll announce the song that we're doing.

5683
03:46:50,250 --> 03:46:51,570
I'll let you guys know.

5684
03:46:51,630 --> 03:46:56,570
If we hit 60k at the Tiltify, you guys will know what song we're doing.

5685
03:47:00,410 --> 03:47:01,490
It's just that easy.

5686
03:47:02,250 --> 03:47:03,070
Oh no.

5687
03:47:03,570 --> 03:47:04,050
$60.

5688
03:47:04,130 --> 03:47:05,350
What will we do?

5689
03:47:06,610 --> 03:47:07,550
Oh no.

5690
03:47:12,640 --> 03:47:14,240
I know you guys want to.

5691
03:47:14,240 --> 03:47:14,460
I want to know.

5692
03:47:14,740 --> 03:47:16,500
Aren't you guys curious?

5693
03:47:23,490 --> 03:47:24,630
Oh, it's like...

5694
03:47:24,630 --> 03:47:26,150
It's like added...

5695
03:47:26,150 --> 03:47:27,170
Okay, it's like...

5696
03:47:27,170 --> 03:47:27,690
Uh...

5697
03:47:27,690 --> 03:47:28,650
We actually...

5698
03:47:28,650 --> 03:47:29,210
Uh...

5699
03:47:29,210 --> 03:47:29,730
We...

5700
03:47:29,730 --> 03:47:32,030
We're adding the auction amount.

5701
03:47:32,350 --> 03:47:34,510
That's why I asked for like what the...

5702
03:47:34,510 --> 03:47:36,150
How much we made on the auction.

5703
03:47:36,590 --> 03:47:37,110
Uh...

5704
03:47:37,110 --> 03:47:41,710
Because we're adding the auction amount to the Tiltify.

5705
03:47:41,930 --> 03:47:43,750
To the stretch goals for this.

5706
03:47:43,810 --> 03:47:45,650
So even though it says 59k...

5707
03:47:46,210 --> 03:47:46,730
Oh!

5708
03:47:46,730 --> 03:47:48,210
It's almost there!

5709
03:47:48,830 --> 03:47:50,650
Holy shit, it's almost there!

5710
03:47:51,090 --> 03:47:52,430
Oh my god, Miku!

5711
03:47:53,790 --> 03:47:56,370
Thank you so much for $500!

5712
03:47:57,590 --> 03:47:58,790
Holy shit!

5713
03:48:01,310 --> 03:48:04,230
Oh my god, thank you for $500!

5714
03:48:05,470 --> 03:48:07,370
Oh my god, thank you!

5715
03:48:07,510 --> 03:48:07,730
Oh!

5716
03:48:08,970 --> 03:48:09,570
Alright.

5717
03:48:09,990 --> 03:48:10,590
Alright.

5718
03:48:11,650 --> 03:48:14,010
We are going to...

5719
03:48:14,010 --> 03:48:14,530
Okay, I need to...

5720
03:48:14,530 --> 03:48:14,870
I don't...

5721
03:48:14,870 --> 03:48:16,130
I need to remember what the name is called.

5722
03:48:16,930 --> 03:48:18,410
It's a Pokemon song!

5723
03:48:18,590 --> 03:48:19,290
I just...

5724
03:48:19,290 --> 03:48:21,090
It's a Pokemon song.

5725
03:48:21,170 --> 03:48:21,890
So I need to...

5726
03:48:21,890 --> 03:48:24,690
I need to remember the actual name.

5727
03:48:29,050 --> 03:48:30,950
Oh, it's 123.

5728
03:48:31,890 --> 03:48:32,890
After the rain.

5729
03:48:34,270 --> 03:48:34,750
Um...

5730
03:48:34,750 --> 03:48:35,350
With Ditto.

5731
03:48:35,750 --> 03:48:38,070
That is the song we're singing.

5732
03:48:39,370 --> 03:48:39,850
Um...

5733
03:48:41,050 --> 03:48:42,830
Apparently, I'm singing Soraru?

5734
03:48:43,030 --> 03:48:43,730
Is that his name?

5735
03:48:43,810 --> 03:48:43,990
Yeah.

5736
03:48:44,130 --> 03:48:44,270
I'm...

5737
03:48:44,270 --> 03:48:44,850
I'm...

5738
03:48:44,850 --> 03:48:51,330
I'm not sure failure is a really good song.

5739
03:48:52,030 --> 03:48:52,550
Uh...

5740
03:48:52,550 --> 03:48:54,010
But I have two songs to cover.

5741
03:48:54,010 --> 03:48:54,610
But that is...

5742
03:48:54,610 --> 03:48:55,850
The duet cover.

5743
03:48:55,950 --> 03:48:57,030
That I'll be doing.

5744
03:48:57,870 --> 03:48:58,390
Um...

5745
03:48:58,390 --> 03:48:59,190
With Ditto!

5746
03:48:59,590 --> 03:49:00,470
There you guys go!

5747
03:49:00,750 --> 03:49:01,370
Now you know!

5748
03:49:01,570 --> 03:49:02,890
Alright, Genshin, I take a knee.

5749
03:49:03,230 --> 03:49:05,130
And one, two, three.

5750
03:49:05,230 --> 03:49:06,150
With Ditto.

5751
03:49:06,610 --> 03:49:07,130
Yeah.

5752
03:49:07,170 --> 03:49:08,330
Yeah, my two cover songs.

5753
03:49:17,690 --> 03:49:18,890
More money raised.

5754
03:49:18,990 --> 03:49:24,470
Well, to be fair, more people are using the money to bid on the auction because it's like a physical item that they can get.

5755
03:49:27,970 --> 03:49:28,530
Let's see.

5756
03:49:28,610 --> 03:49:33,530
I'm just trying to see what else can we do before we actually do stuff.

5757
03:49:34,670 --> 03:49:37,870
It's just been me talking as we were like for hours.

5758
03:49:42,470 --> 03:49:44,090
What the fuck?

5759
03:49:44,530 --> 03:49:45,870
Not important?

5760
03:49:46,010 --> 03:49:47,410
What the fuck?

5761
03:49:48,150 --> 03:49:50,150
Wait, how do I get a forklift certification?

5762
03:49:51,730 --> 03:49:52,930
Forklift certification.

5763
03:49:55,010 --> 03:49:56,210
How do I do that?

5764
03:49:56,410 --> 03:49:57,990
Okay, forklift certification.

5765
03:49:58,990 --> 03:50:00,710
Everything you need to know.

5766
03:50:02,110 --> 03:50:04,010
What counts as a forklift?

5767
03:50:04,010 --> 03:50:04,870
How do I get that?

5768
03:50:05,850 --> 03:50:07,170
Contact us today.

5769
03:50:07,270 --> 03:50:07,850
Okay.

5770
03:50:07,870 --> 03:50:10,250
Okay, offers a training course.

5771
03:50:10,330 --> 03:50:11,110
Do I have to be there?

5772
03:50:11,550 --> 03:50:13,930
Do I have to be there?

5773
03:50:16,850 --> 03:50:18,630
Like, I need to know.

5774
03:50:19,450 --> 03:50:22,970
Do I actually have to be there to get a certificate?

5775
03:50:25,670 --> 03:50:27,790
Well, I cannot just take a test?

5776
03:50:28,930 --> 03:50:30,610
Okay, forklift certification.

5777
03:50:32,370 --> 03:50:32,930
Test.

5778
03:50:33,490 --> 03:50:37,510
There must be a way where I can just pay and just get a random certificate.

5779
03:50:37,510 --> 03:50:38,850
In Connecticut or something.

5780
03:50:39,110 --> 03:50:44,110
Like, there has to be a state that would just let me...

5781
03:50:44,110 --> 03:50:44,910
Like, even though I'm Canadian.

5782
03:50:45,230 --> 03:50:46,690
I know I'm Canadian.

5783
03:50:47,710 --> 03:50:54,950
But there has to be a state that's corrupted enough to just let me pay to have a certificate.

5784
03:51:01,570 --> 03:51:02,490
That's illegal.

5785
03:51:06,170 --> 03:51:10,250
There has to be one state.

5786
03:51:10,390 --> 03:51:11,030
It's okay.

5787
03:51:11,110 --> 03:51:14,790
I'll only be able to legally drive a forklift.

5788
03:51:15,870 --> 03:51:16,830
There.

5789
03:51:17,330 --> 03:51:18,130
I know.

5790
03:51:19,770 --> 03:51:21,310
Doki, please.

5791
03:51:23,990 --> 03:51:26,530
Forklifting is serious business.

5792
03:51:26,830 --> 03:51:28,670
How dare you.

5793
03:51:28,850 --> 03:51:31,290
How fucking dare you.

5794
03:51:32,630 --> 03:51:34,110
Forklifting is serious.

5795
03:51:34,490 --> 03:51:36,910
Why would you illegally want it?

5796
03:51:37,050 --> 03:51:39,950
How fucking dare you, Doki.

5797
03:51:43,970 --> 03:51:46,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

5798
03:51:47,690 --> 03:51:49,050
I don't know what you're talking about.

5799
03:51:49,370 --> 03:51:50,450
Alright, guys.

5800
03:51:50,850 --> 03:51:52,430
Oh shit, what the fuck?

5801
03:51:52,450 --> 03:51:54,450
When did we get 62K?

5802
03:51:55,150 --> 03:51:59,910
I was talking about fucking forklifts and we got the 62K.

5803
03:52:02,030 --> 03:52:03,310
Oh my god.

5804
03:52:03,330 --> 03:52:04,210
Thank you guys.

5805
03:52:04,330 --> 03:52:04,930
That's crazy.

5806
03:52:05,630 --> 03:52:06,550
Oh my god.

5807
03:52:06,590 --> 03:52:09,270
Cancelled by forklift operations on Twitter.

5808
03:52:09,390 --> 03:52:10,370
What are you gonna do?

5809
03:52:10,610 --> 03:52:12,430
Cancel me because of charity?

5810
03:52:13,270 --> 03:52:14,310
That's fucked up.

5811
03:52:14,350 --> 03:52:16,970
If they cancel me, I'll just be like, you hate charity.

5812
03:52:17,370 --> 03:52:20,010
Yeah, what can they do after that?

5813
03:52:22,830 --> 03:52:24,210
They can't cancel me.

5814
03:52:24,530 --> 03:52:26,090
It's all about the charity.

5815
03:52:28,110 --> 03:52:29,070
That's fucked up.

5816
03:52:30,410 --> 03:52:31,670
Alright, let's see.

5817
03:52:34,150 --> 03:52:37,690
I'm trying to like see what's next after this.

5818
03:52:38,010 --> 03:52:43,330
Oh my god, we can actually do something.

5819
03:52:45,770 --> 03:52:46,810
Alright, guys.

5820
03:52:47,850 --> 03:52:49,750
We can actually play something.

5821
03:52:50,010 --> 03:52:52,090
We're at the point where we can...

5822
03:52:52,090 --> 03:52:54,670
We don't have to talk anymore, chat.

5823
03:52:54,810 --> 03:52:56,310
We finally hit it.

5824
03:52:56,470 --> 03:52:57,850
We finally...

5825
03:52:58,970 --> 03:53:03,690
We've reached the point where we can actually play something.

5826
03:53:04,210 --> 03:53:05,630
Oh my god.

5827
03:53:05,910 --> 03:53:07,110
We've made it.

5828
03:53:07,130 --> 03:53:08,990
It took us four hours.

5829
03:53:09,250 --> 03:53:11,230
But we made it.

5830
03:53:12,270 --> 03:53:13,850
Oh shit, but the pull.

5831
03:53:14,050 --> 03:53:14,390
Oh shit.

5832
03:53:14,510 --> 03:53:15,090
Okay, don't worry.

5833
03:53:15,570 --> 03:53:16,010
Tomboy won.

5834
03:53:16,250 --> 03:53:16,530
Okay.

5835
03:53:16,690 --> 03:53:20,830
The next one, the next official outfit will be tomboy.

5836
03:53:21,850 --> 03:53:24,770
The four hour ad is over.

5837
03:53:25,550 --> 03:53:26,750
What if we fucked up?

5838
03:53:26,750 --> 03:53:28,830
I made you guys watch me play supermarket simulator.

5839
03:53:29,190 --> 03:53:29,730
That would be pretty...

5840
03:53:32,950 --> 03:53:34,030
I wouldn't, guys.

5841
03:53:34,170 --> 03:53:35,150
I swear I would not.

5842
03:53:35,190 --> 03:53:36,530
I'm not gonna make you guys...

5843
03:53:36,530 --> 03:53:39,470
I would not make you guys watch me play supermarket simulator.

5844
03:53:40,650 --> 03:53:42,030
Even for charity.

5845
03:53:42,550 --> 03:53:44,930
That's gonna be on my schedule next week.

5846
03:53:45,070 --> 03:53:45,750
Do not worry.

5847
03:53:45,990 --> 03:53:47,070
That would be...

5848
03:53:47,070 --> 03:53:48,710
Do not worry, chat.

5849
03:53:49,530 --> 03:53:51,650
That will be its own thing.

5850
03:53:51,950 --> 03:53:54,050
So do not worry about that.

5851
03:53:54,310 --> 03:53:56,730
Anyway, actually I'm gonna check the auction real quick before we go.

5852
03:53:56,730 --> 03:53:57,550
Before we actually play anything.

5853
03:53:58,130 --> 03:53:59,130
Oh, we can...

5854
03:53:59,130 --> 03:54:00,050
We can play forklift.

5855
03:54:00,050 --> 03:54:00,850
Okay, let me...

5856
03:54:00,850 --> 03:54:01,590
We can do forklift.

5857
03:54:01,670 --> 03:54:05,070
Let's get our forklift certification on the internet.

5858
03:54:06,450 --> 03:54:07,010
Forklift.

5859
03:54:08,050 --> 03:54:11,590
Okay, we'll get our forklift certificate on the internet.

5860
03:54:12,830 --> 03:54:15,710
Which is the best forklift simulator?

5861
03:54:16,730 --> 03:54:17,790
Guys, I...

5862
03:54:24,170 --> 03:54:26,710
Guys, which is the best forklift simulator?

5863
03:54:26,710 --> 03:54:27,690
Forklift game.

5864
03:54:29,250 --> 03:54:30,610
On Steam.

5865
03:54:31,350 --> 03:54:32,650
I need to know.

5866
03:54:33,210 --> 03:54:36,370
Okay, best forklift operator.

5867
03:54:36,590 --> 03:54:39,290
No, this one says 196 reviews.

5868
03:54:39,650 --> 03:54:41,370
They deserve to be called...

5869
03:54:41,370 --> 03:54:44,890
Okay, can I get a certificate that allows you to visit three warehouses?

5870
03:54:46,350 --> 03:54:51,250
This game was in early access for five months?

5871
03:54:51,530 --> 03:54:52,610
Oh my god.

5872
03:54:55,550 --> 03:54:56,670
Wait, is that...

5873
03:54:56,670 --> 03:54:56,690
Wait, is that...

5874
03:54:56,690 --> 03:54:57,410
Is that an actual game?

5875
03:55:00,280 --> 03:55:01,400
What is this?

5876
03:55:02,180 --> 03:55:04,200
This is not forklift.

5877
03:55:04,260 --> 03:55:06,460
This is a martial artist game.

5878
03:55:06,860 --> 03:55:08,160
Who keeps saying...

5879
03:55:08,740 --> 03:55:09,940
What is this game?

5880
03:55:10,160 --> 03:55:11,980
I'm talking about forklift.

5881
03:55:18,200 --> 03:55:20,100
Oh my god.

5882
03:55:20,880 --> 03:55:21,560
Alright.

5883
03:55:22,220 --> 03:55:23,920
Okay, there is...

5884
03:55:23,920 --> 03:55:25,360
Okay, there is one.

5885
03:55:25,520 --> 03:55:26,620
We have...

5886
03:55:28,060 --> 03:55:29,100
There is one...

5887
03:55:29,100 --> 03:55:31,440
Okay, this is called best forklift operator.

5888
03:55:31,800 --> 03:55:32,680
Wait, is this only in VR?

5889
03:55:33,460 --> 03:55:34,120
No, okay.

5890
03:55:34,200 --> 03:55:36,460
This can be played...

5891
03:55:37,000 --> 03:55:38,240
This can be played on PC.

5892
03:55:38,580 --> 03:55:39,820
Okay, let me double check.

5893
03:55:40,560 --> 03:55:42,260
Warehouse forklift, forklift in box.

5894
03:55:42,760 --> 03:55:43,980
Alright, I'm gonna buy this.

5895
03:55:44,140 --> 03:55:44,880
I'm spent...

5896
03:55:44,880 --> 03:55:45,700
I need you guys to know.

5897
03:55:46,360 --> 03:55:48,000
I'm literally spending...

5898
03:55:49,700 --> 03:55:50,140
$25.

5899
03:55:50,460 --> 03:55:51,000
I'm kidding.

5900
03:55:54,820 --> 03:55:55,700
I'm kidding.

5901
03:55:55,700 --> 03:55:55,980
I'm kidding.

5902
03:55:55,980 --> 03:55:57,300
I'm gonna play forklift simulator.

5903
03:56:01,720 --> 03:56:03,760
Okay, it's not forklift simulator.

5904
03:56:03,940 --> 03:56:04,460
It is...

5905
03:56:04,760 --> 03:56:06,340
It is not forklift simulator.

5906
03:56:06,760 --> 03:56:07,720
It's like...

5907
03:56:07,720 --> 03:56:08,620
It's called...

5908
03:56:08,620 --> 03:56:09,440
What is it called?

5909
03:56:10,800 --> 03:56:12,020
Fuck, what is this called?

5910
03:56:12,740 --> 03:56:15,060
It's called best forklift operator.

5911
03:56:15,500 --> 03:56:18,000
And I will be playing...

5912
03:56:18,000 --> 03:56:19,420
I'm gonna play...

5913
03:56:19,420 --> 03:56:21,720
Pay $25 for this.

5914
03:56:22,080 --> 03:56:24,640
I just need to remember what my password is.

5915
03:56:24,640 --> 03:56:27,060
And I need to make sure I don't say it out loud.

5916
03:56:31,120 --> 03:56:31,640
Okay.

5917
03:56:32,240 --> 03:56:35,280
Yeah, remember my password real quick, guys.

5918
03:56:36,720 --> 03:56:37,240
Alright.

5919
03:56:37,440 --> 03:56:37,920
It's okay.

5920
03:56:38,000 --> 03:56:40,340
Thank god for password manager.

5921
03:56:40,680 --> 03:56:41,660
Thank god.

5922
03:56:44,320 --> 03:56:44,840
Alright.

5923
03:56:45,520 --> 03:56:46,500
Oh my god.

5924
03:56:47,400 --> 03:56:50,540
That would be very unfortunate if you guys had a password for that.

5925
03:56:50,760 --> 03:56:52,500
That would be so unfortunate.

5926
03:56:53,580 --> 03:56:54,100
Alright.

5927
03:56:56,120 --> 03:57:00,080
I'm gonna be the best forklift operator out there.

5928
03:57:01,420 --> 03:57:02,380
And then...

5929
03:57:02,380 --> 03:57:04,460
And then I'll take an actual test.

5930
03:57:04,900 --> 03:57:07,800
I need to know for sure if I'm good at this.

5931
03:57:08,380 --> 03:57:09,200
Okay, guys.

5932
03:57:09,400 --> 03:57:12,180
Like, I need to know for sure that this is...

5933
03:57:12,180 --> 03:57:13,060
That I would pass.

5934
03:57:13,300 --> 03:57:14,860
If I do it now...

5935
03:57:15,620 --> 03:57:16,840
If I do it now...

5936
03:57:17,540 --> 03:57:20,680
I'll be like prepared for the actual written test.

5937
03:57:22,220 --> 03:57:23,140
Okay, let me down.

5938
03:57:23,200 --> 03:57:24,480
I need to down.

5939
03:57:24,480 --> 03:57:25,560
Did I not buy it?

5940
03:57:26,680 --> 03:57:27,500
Oh my god.

5941
03:57:27,520 --> 03:57:28,080
Did I forget?

5942
03:57:28,160 --> 03:57:28,860
Oh my god.

5943
03:57:28,900 --> 03:57:30,420
I fucking forgot to buy it.

5944
03:57:30,420 --> 03:57:31,860
Are you fucking kidding me?

5945
03:57:32,340 --> 03:57:32,940
Oh yeah.

5946
03:57:32,960 --> 03:57:33,140
Okay.

5947
03:57:33,220 --> 03:57:34,080
Agree and pay.

5948
03:57:35,180 --> 03:57:36,220
We're doing it live.

5949
03:57:36,440 --> 03:57:38,600
I forgot to agree to the terms of service.

5950
03:57:39,140 --> 03:57:40,420
So I never bought it.

5951
03:57:40,480 --> 03:57:44,980
I never bought it because I forgot to agree to the terms of service.

5952
03:57:45,320 --> 03:57:45,780
Alright.

5953
03:57:45,980 --> 03:57:46,840
Install content.

5954
03:57:47,640 --> 03:57:48,100
Nice.

5955
03:57:48,400 --> 03:57:49,920
It's 8 gigabyte.

5956
03:57:50,000 --> 03:57:50,700
Holy fuck.

5957
03:57:50,780 --> 03:57:54,460
Why the fuck is the forklift operator 8 gigabyte?

5958
03:57:54,460 --> 03:57:54,960
8 gigabytes.

5959
03:57:56,840 --> 03:57:58,460
What is in there?

5960
03:57:58,840 --> 03:58:00,560
Are they bitcoin mining?

5961
03:58:01,220 --> 03:58:03,460
Alright, let me go to solo gaming real fast.

5962
03:58:03,820 --> 03:58:04,020
Okay.

5963
03:58:04,080 --> 03:58:04,780
Solo gaming.

5964
03:58:06,440 --> 03:58:07,080
Boop.

5965
03:58:07,160 --> 03:58:07,520
Alright.

5966
03:58:08,260 --> 03:58:09,160
Here we go.

5967
03:58:09,980 --> 03:58:11,100
I can't believe.

5968
03:58:12,860 --> 03:58:13,780
Forklift simulator.

5969
03:58:14,000 --> 03:58:14,240
Okay.

5970
03:58:14,300 --> 03:58:18,620
But forklift simulator 2023 has terrible reviews.

5971
03:58:18,800 --> 03:58:21,360
We need to be properly trained.

5972
03:58:21,560 --> 03:58:23,500
We can't cheese the system.

5973
03:58:23,660 --> 03:58:24,440
Because when I make it...

5974
03:58:24,440 --> 03:58:31,020
When I said why can't I just pay to get the degree, people were like no.

5975
03:58:31,440 --> 03:58:34,440
Forklifting is serious business, guys.

5976
03:58:34,780 --> 03:58:41,660
So of course, because it's serious business, of course I will pay for the most expensive one.

5977
03:58:44,200 --> 03:58:46,080
Is this not what you wanted?

5978
03:58:47,400 --> 03:58:51,720
You guys were like, woah, you can't cheap out on this.

5979
03:58:51,720 --> 03:58:52,780
Woah!

5980
03:58:54,540 --> 03:58:57,760
Doki, we're ashamed of you for cheaping out.

5981
03:59:03,460 --> 03:59:04,760
Alright, here we go.

5982
03:59:06,400 --> 03:59:11,600
You know, watch me be the best forklift operator out there for charity.

5983
03:59:11,720 --> 03:59:13,980
This is my content now.

5984
03:59:15,180 --> 03:59:16,460
Okay, gaming.

5985
03:59:16,540 --> 03:59:20,100
It's not World Quest, it's forklift operator.

5986
03:59:21,720 --> 03:59:22,820
There's a leaderboard?

5987
03:59:23,540 --> 03:59:29,540
Why is there a leaderboard for this?

5988
03:59:30,280 --> 03:59:33,700
There's gonna be someone better than me?

5989
03:59:37,620 --> 03:59:38,820
Do you want to play?

5990
03:59:38,920 --> 03:59:39,140
Sure.

5991
03:59:40,400 --> 03:59:41,000
Sure.

5992
03:59:41,720 --> 03:59:43,820
Welcome to the tutorial mode.

5993
03:59:44,140 --> 03:59:49,460
Before you become the best forklift operator you have to know how to steer a forklift.

5994
03:59:49,500 --> 03:59:49,760
Okay.

5995
03:59:49,760 --> 03:59:49,880
Okay.

5996
03:59:49,940 --> 03:59:51,760
Let's learn the basis of Forklift.

5997
03:59:51,880 --> 03:59:53,120
Driving and... alright.

5998
03:59:55,840 --> 03:59:56,780
What is this?

5999
03:59:56,920 --> 03:59:57,600
What is square?

6000
03:59:58,160 --> 04:00:00,560
What is... this is mouse and keyboard.

6001
04:00:01,000 --> 04:00:02,540
Why is this...

6002
04:00:03,260 --> 04:00:04,080
No, please.

6003
04:00:04,380 --> 04:00:05,520
Why is this not...

6004
04:00:05,520 --> 04:00:07,180
Why is this not mouse and keyboard?

6005
04:00:07,760 --> 04:00:08,680
What is square?

6006
04:00:09,460 --> 04:00:10,160
Oh, okay.

6007
04:00:10,280 --> 04:00:12,000
Be careful and control your current progress.

6008
04:00:12,340 --> 04:00:12,600
Okay.

6009
04:00:13,300 --> 04:00:14,180
Next to...

6010
04:00:14,740 --> 04:00:16,740
Press to add number of crashes.

6011
04:00:16,740 --> 04:00:21,880
In career... in career mode on the right, you can find information about earned money.

6012
04:00:22,100 --> 04:00:23,740
If you need a break, just pause the game.

6013
04:00:23,840 --> 04:00:25,100
What is... what is lines?

6014
04:00:26,600 --> 04:00:27,400
What's a line?

6015
04:00:29,120 --> 04:00:32,300
Go straight ahead using... if you need to stop, press X.

6016
04:00:32,320 --> 04:00:32,860
What is X?

6017
04:00:33,180 --> 04:00:35,200
What... what is X?

6018
04:00:36,700 --> 04:00:37,900
We're forklifting, guys.

6019
04:00:38,040 --> 04:00:38,720
This is serious.

6020
04:00:39,400 --> 04:00:39,840
Okay.

6021
04:00:39,920 --> 04:00:40,560
I'm gonna...

6022
04:00:41,260 --> 04:00:41,700
Ow.

6023
04:00:41,860 --> 04:00:42,080
Okay.

6024
04:00:42,260 --> 04:00:42,840
It's okay.

6025
04:00:42,900 --> 04:00:44,100
I didn't hurt too much.

6026
04:00:45,500 --> 04:00:45,940
Alright.

6027
04:00:46,020 --> 04:00:46,160
Wait.

6028
04:00:46,240 --> 04:00:46,720
Do I need...

6029
04:00:46,740 --> 04:00:47,860
Do I need to drive in a straight line?

6030
04:00:48,000 --> 04:00:48,680
Can I just...

6031
04:00:48,680 --> 04:00:50,160
Oh, it doesn't matter.

6032
04:00:50,260 --> 04:00:50,780
I don't get penalties.

6033
04:00:51,060 --> 04:00:51,280
Okay.

6034
04:00:51,800 --> 04:00:52,320
Alright.

6035
04:00:53,380 --> 04:00:53,900
Alright.

6036
04:00:54,000 --> 04:00:56,060
I'm gonna lower... I'm gonna lower this.

6037
04:00:56,520 --> 04:00:57,460
How do I reverse?

6038
04:00:58,280 --> 04:00:59,220
I can't reverse.

6039
04:01:01,640 --> 04:01:03,900
My PlayStation isn't plugged in!

6040
04:01:04,300 --> 04:01:05,320
How do I reverse?

6041
04:01:05,800 --> 04:01:06,800
How do I reverse?

6042
04:01:11,680 --> 04:01:13,320
I can't lower it!

6043
04:01:13,440 --> 04:01:14,260
This is aslo...

6044
04:01:14,260 --> 04:01:14,720
Guys.

6045
04:01:15,080 --> 04:01:15,600
Guys.

6046
04:01:15,600 --> 04:01:15,720
Guys.

6047
04:01:15,720 --> 04:01:16,280
I don't know.

6048
04:01:16,340 --> 04:01:19,220
I don't think I'm gonna be the best forklift operator out there.

6049
04:01:19,540 --> 04:01:21,520
I have... I have a feeling.

6050
04:01:25,060 --> 04:01:27,800
I have... I'm getting control.

6051
04:01:28,820 --> 04:01:29,300
Guys.

6052
04:01:30,580 --> 04:01:31,700
I have a feeling.

6053
04:01:32,460 --> 04:01:36,380
I have a feeling this is gonna... I might as well just bribe somebody.

6054
04:01:37,360 --> 04:01:38,320
For charity.

6055
04:01:38,820 --> 04:01:41,460
If I tell him it's for charity, do you think he'll give me a certificate?

6056
04:01:42,000 --> 04:01:42,920
Do you think?

6057
04:01:46,980 --> 04:01:49,060
I'm gonna pay $25 for this.

6058
04:01:49,160 --> 04:01:50,340
I can't plug in my control!

6059
04:01:50,500 --> 04:01:50,980
There it is.

6060
04:01:51,300 --> 04:01:51,780
Okay.

6061
04:01:52,980 --> 04:01:53,460
Okay.

6062
04:01:53,480 --> 04:01:54,040
Here we go.

6063
04:01:54,120 --> 04:01:54,520
Nice.

6064
04:01:54,580 --> 04:01:55,340
Controller plugged.

6065
04:01:56,400 --> 04:01:57,240
Controller plugged.

6066
04:01:57,680 --> 04:01:58,160
Whoa!

6067
04:01:58,700 --> 04:01:59,180
Whoa!

6068
04:02:01,240 --> 04:02:02,060
Oh, oh.

6069
04:02:02,780 --> 04:02:03,520
Oh, oh.

6070
04:02:03,520 --> 04:02:04,080
I'm doing it!

6071
04:02:04,680 --> 04:02:05,660
I'm doing it!

6072
04:02:06,320 --> 04:02:06,800
Oh!

6073
04:02:07,000 --> 04:02:07,480
Nope.

6074
04:02:07,720 --> 04:02:08,200
Nope.

6075
04:02:08,320 --> 04:02:08,660
Nope.

6076
04:02:08,660 --> 04:02:09,680
How do I drive back?

6077
04:02:10,500 --> 04:02:10,980
Okay.

6078
04:02:11,740 --> 04:02:12,500
Drive back.

6079
04:02:12,500 --> 04:02:12,940
No.

6080
04:02:12,980 --> 04:02:13,620
That's honking.

6081
04:02:17,200 --> 04:02:17,880
Whoa!

6082
04:02:18,220 --> 04:02:19,380
Where am I?

6083
04:02:23,760 --> 04:02:24,440
Please.

6084
04:02:24,440 --> 04:02:25,120
Reverse!

6085
04:02:26,000 --> 04:02:26,680
Reverse!

6086
04:02:29,400 --> 04:02:30,080
Reverse!

6087
04:02:31,220 --> 04:02:32,120
Oh my god.

6088
04:02:32,340 --> 04:02:32,880
Wait.

6089
04:02:32,940 --> 04:02:33,920
We're gonna figure this out.

6090
04:02:34,060 --> 04:02:34,740
Gamepad.

6091
04:02:35,700 --> 04:02:36,860
Forklift up.

6092
04:02:37,060 --> 04:02:38,580
Acceleration brake.

6093
04:02:39,360 --> 04:02:40,560
There's no reverse!

6094
04:02:40,560 --> 04:02:41,240
Reverse!

6095
04:02:41,380 --> 04:02:43,420
There's actually no...

6096
04:02:43,420 --> 04:02:43,640
Wait.

6097
04:02:43,700 --> 04:02:44,780
Is it transmission change?

6098
04:02:45,160 --> 04:02:46,660
Left stick button.

6099
04:02:46,880 --> 04:02:47,960
It has to be.

6100
04:02:48,140 --> 04:02:49,540
It has to be.

6101
04:02:49,960 --> 04:02:50,720
Okay.

6102
04:02:54,620 --> 04:02:55,640
Am I...

6103
04:02:55,640 --> 04:02:57,160
Am I doing it?

6104
04:02:59,000 --> 04:03:00,040
Am I...

6105
04:03:00,040 --> 04:03:02,820
Am I doing it?

6106
04:03:05,720 --> 04:03:06,480
Please!

6107
04:03:09,260 --> 04:03:10,020
Reverse!

6108
04:03:10,020 --> 04:03:10,780
Please!

6109
04:03:11,240 --> 04:03:11,260
Reverse!

6110
04:03:11,260 --> 04:03:11,320
Reverse!

6111
04:03:11,800 --> 04:03:12,380
Reverse!

6112
04:03:12,380 --> 04:03:13,240
Please!

6113
04:03:13,300 --> 04:03:13,780
Please!

6114
04:03:13,780 --> 04:03:13,800
Okay.

6115
04:03:13,920 --> 04:03:14,540
I'm gonna restart.

6116
04:03:14,860 --> 04:03:15,640
I'm gonna restart.

6117
04:03:15,820 --> 04:03:16,160
Don't worry.

6118
04:03:16,240 --> 04:03:18,460
I'm gonna get forklift certification right here.

6119
04:03:18,880 --> 04:03:19,540
All right.

6120
04:03:19,700 --> 04:03:20,180
Nice.

6121
04:03:20,480 --> 04:03:20,960
Okay.

6122
04:03:22,980 --> 04:03:23,460
Start.

6123
04:03:23,640 --> 04:03:23,940
All right.

6124
04:03:24,360 --> 04:03:25,680
At top left side.

6125
04:03:25,780 --> 04:03:26,600
Next to pallet.

6126
04:03:26,680 --> 04:03:27,320
Number of crashes.

6127
04:03:27,480 --> 04:03:28,300
Use carrier mode.

6128
04:03:29,100 --> 04:03:29,580
Okay.

6129
04:03:29,620 --> 04:03:30,440
You go straight ahead.

6130
04:03:30,740 --> 04:03:32,480
If you need to stop, press X.

6131
04:03:32,980 --> 04:03:33,460
Okay.

6132
04:03:34,460 --> 04:03:35,320
Oh, there we go.

6133
04:03:35,940 --> 04:03:36,420
Okay.

6134
04:03:36,520 --> 04:03:37,160
We're doing this.

6135
04:03:38,700 --> 04:03:39,540
Am I going reverse?

6136
04:03:40,260 --> 04:03:40,740
Okay.

6137
04:03:41,880 --> 04:03:42,360
Okay.

6138
04:03:42,880 --> 04:03:44,100
Why am I not going reverse?

6139
04:03:45,420 --> 04:03:46,420
Why am I not...

6140
04:03:47,080 --> 04:03:48,280
Why am I not going reverse?

6141
04:03:49,060 --> 04:03:49,520
Oh!

6142
04:03:50,560 --> 04:03:51,460
I'm going reverse!

6143
04:03:51,720 --> 04:03:51,940
Oh!

6144
04:03:52,020 --> 04:03:52,760
I figured it out!

6145
04:03:52,800 --> 04:03:53,320
I figured it out!

6146
04:03:53,340 --> 04:03:53,520
Guys!

6147
04:03:54,180 --> 04:03:54,640
Guys!

6148
04:03:55,160 --> 04:03:56,320
I figured it out!

6149
04:03:56,420 --> 04:03:56,980
It's okay.

6150
04:03:58,100 --> 04:04:00,000
We don't need to follow this anymore.

6151
04:04:00,340 --> 04:04:00,800
Okay.

6152
04:04:01,800 --> 04:04:02,260
Use...

6153
04:04:03,220 --> 04:04:03,680
Okay.

6154
04:04:03,740 --> 04:04:04,840
We need to do that.

6155
04:04:04,840 --> 04:04:06,060
And then...

6156
04:04:06,800 --> 04:04:07,260
No.

6157
04:04:08,200 --> 04:04:08,660
No.

6158
04:04:10,440 --> 04:04:10,900
No.

6159
04:04:10,940 --> 04:04:11,240
No.

6160
04:04:11,240 --> 04:04:11,380
No.

6161
04:04:11,380 --> 04:04:11,620
No.

6162
04:04:11,880 --> 04:04:12,340
No.

6163
04:04:12,360 --> 04:04:13,220
Come on, Doki.

6164
04:04:13,720 --> 04:04:15,920
You got to pass that test, Doki!

6165
04:04:16,280 --> 04:04:17,000
All right.

6166
04:04:17,020 --> 04:04:17,260
Nice.

6167
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:18,560
Okay.

6168
04:04:18,660 --> 04:04:19,380
Now reverse.

6169
04:04:21,680 --> 04:04:22,240
Oh.

6170
04:04:22,260 --> 04:04:22,480
Wait.

6171
04:04:22,560 --> 04:04:22,680
What?

6172
04:04:23,740 --> 04:04:24,300
Okay.

6173
04:04:24,520 --> 04:04:25,020
All right.

6174
04:04:25,040 --> 04:04:25,460
Now...

6175
04:04:25,460 --> 04:04:26,640
Now up it go!

6176
04:04:26,940 --> 04:04:27,860
Up it go!

6177
04:04:30,140 --> 04:04:31,440
Oh my God!

6178
04:04:36,950 --> 04:04:38,090
Oh my God!

6179
04:04:38,290 --> 04:04:40,850
This forklift certification is so easy.

6180
04:04:41,390 --> 04:04:42,710
Oh my God!

6181
04:04:42,750 --> 04:04:45,030
Why do you need a license for this?

6182
04:04:45,130 --> 04:04:45,630
Oh my God!

6183
04:04:45,650 --> 04:04:47,490
A child can do it!

6184
04:04:47,770 --> 04:04:48,250
Ow.

6185
04:04:48,410 --> 04:04:48,730
Okay.

6186
04:04:49,170 --> 04:04:49,810
It's okay.

6187
04:04:49,910 --> 04:04:50,530
It doesn't matter.

6188
04:04:50,750 --> 04:04:52,210
They're not that expensive anyway.

6189
04:04:52,890 --> 04:04:53,370
Okay.

6190
04:04:53,510 --> 04:04:55,850
So it's better to support the pallets.

6191
04:04:55,850 --> 04:04:56,910
So supported already.

6192
04:04:57,130 --> 04:04:57,690
Oh, okay.

6193
04:04:57,770 --> 04:04:59,490
We need to put this...

6194
04:04:59,490 --> 04:05:00,210
Okay.

6195
04:05:00,230 --> 04:05:01,130
We got to put it here.

6196
04:05:02,250 --> 04:05:02,970
All right.

6197
04:05:03,070 --> 04:05:04,550
And then we go forward.

6198
04:05:05,790 --> 04:05:06,270
Gaming.

6199
04:05:07,950 --> 04:05:08,430
Okay.

6200
04:05:08,530 --> 04:05:09,190
And then we...

6201
04:05:10,190 --> 04:05:11,090
Up it goes.

6202
04:05:11,950 --> 04:05:12,910
And then...

6203
04:05:13,870 --> 04:05:14,750
Oh my God!

6204
04:05:14,770 --> 04:05:15,630
I'm so fucked up!

6205
04:05:15,650 --> 04:05:16,750
Get out of this game.

6206
04:05:17,630 --> 04:05:18,110
Okay.

6207
04:05:18,190 --> 04:05:18,810
And then...

6208
04:05:19,310 --> 04:05:19,790
Reverse.

6209
04:05:21,110 --> 04:05:21,590
Wait.

6210
04:05:21,670 --> 04:05:22,150
Get out.

6211
04:05:22,190 --> 04:05:22,530
How does...

6212
04:05:22,530 --> 04:05:23,670
How do I let it leave?

6213
04:05:25,770 --> 04:05:26,250
Leave.

6214
04:05:27,150 --> 04:05:28,250
No, no, no, no, no.

6215
04:05:28,250 --> 04:05:28,530
Leave.

6216
04:05:29,030 --> 04:05:30,650
Leave my fucking thing!

6217
04:05:32,570 --> 04:05:33,050
Okay.

6218
04:05:33,770 --> 04:05:34,250
Guys.

6219
04:05:35,730 --> 04:05:36,650
Oh, oh.

6220
04:05:36,870 --> 04:05:37,350
Leave.

6221
04:05:38,550 --> 04:05:39,030
Leave!

6222
04:05:40,070 --> 04:05:40,550
Leave!

6223
04:05:40,970 --> 04:05:41,030
Leave!

6224
04:05:43,470 --> 04:05:45,550
It has to fall in vain!

6225
04:05:45,570 --> 04:05:45,630
Oh, oh.

6226
04:05:45,650 --> 04:05:45,990
Eventually!

6227
04:05:47,350 --> 04:05:48,030
Leave!

6228
04:05:52,670 --> 04:05:54,090
Why isn't it...

6229
04:05:54,090 --> 04:05:55,550
Why isn't gravity working?

6230
04:05:58,670 --> 04:05:59,350
Gravity!

6231
04:06:00,430 --> 04:06:01,110
Gravity!

6232
04:06:04,390 --> 04:06:05,670
It wouldn't leave.

6233
04:06:06,290 --> 04:06:07,650
I'm reversing!

6234
04:06:08,250 --> 04:06:09,290
I'm stuck!

6235
04:06:09,710 --> 04:06:10,890
Why am I stuck?

6236
04:06:11,330 --> 04:06:12,450
What is stuck?

6237
04:06:13,530 --> 04:06:14,810
What is stu...

6238
04:06:14,810 --> 04:06:15,030
Oh!

6239
04:06:15,710 --> 04:06:16,150
Oh!

6240
04:06:16,410 --> 04:06:16,850
Wait.

6241
04:06:16,910 --> 04:06:17,230
I'm out.

6242
04:06:17,330 --> 04:06:17,570
I'm out.

6243
04:06:17,590 --> 04:06:17,930
I'm out.

6244
04:06:18,950 --> 04:06:19,470
I'm out.

6245
04:06:20,430 --> 04:06:21,110
It worked!

6246
04:06:22,750 --> 04:06:23,570
I did it!

6247
04:06:24,930 --> 04:06:25,530
Okay, wait.

6248
04:06:26,350 --> 04:06:27,170
Did I do it?

6249
04:06:28,430 --> 04:06:28,910
Did I?

6250
04:06:29,770 --> 04:06:30,210
Yeah.

6251
04:06:31,150 --> 04:06:31,990
I missed?

6252
04:06:32,350 --> 04:06:33,190
What do you mean?

6253
04:06:33,250 --> 04:06:34,990
It's clearly on the thing!

6254
04:06:35,950 --> 04:06:36,390
Oh!

6255
04:06:36,630 --> 04:06:38,950
Does it have to be specifically a line?

6256
04:06:39,090 --> 04:06:39,990
This is so...

6257
04:06:39,990 --> 04:06:40,210
No.

6258
04:06:40,370 --> 04:06:40,790
No.

6259
04:06:40,830 --> 04:06:41,230
Please.

6260
04:06:41,990 --> 04:06:42,430
Please.

6261
04:06:42,990 --> 04:06:43,430
Please.

6262
04:06:48,470 --> 04:06:49,030
PLEASE!

6263
04:06:49,030 --> 04:06:52,310
Please, why is it like this?!

6264
04:06:52,310 --> 04:06:53,270
PLEASE!

6265
04:06:56,870 --> 04:06:57,430
Alright.

6266
04:06:57,770 --> 04:06:59,090
I think I'm ready.

6267
04:06:59,210 --> 04:07:01,410
I think the tutorial has taught me enough.

6268
04:07:01,950 --> 04:07:02,510
Honestly.

6269
04:07:02,690 --> 04:07:04,370
I think I'm ready for like...

6270
04:07:04,370 --> 04:07:07,230
I think I'm ready for level one.

6271
04:07:07,470 --> 04:07:13,450
I think I'm ready for the grudge.

6272
04:07:14,610 --> 04:07:15,170
Oh..

6273
04:07:15,170 --> 04:07:15,250
That's a good one.

6274
04:07:15,250 --> 04:07:25,910
If I successfully get $500 with only five within eight minutes, then I'm forklift certified.

6275
04:07:26,130 --> 04:07:28,490
I will actually take a test for forklift certification though.

6276
04:07:29,020 --> 04:07:30,930
I would actually do it.

6277
04:07:31,050 --> 04:07:31,930
But like...

6278
04:07:33,330 --> 04:07:37,350
But like I have to play this game first to see my potential.

6279
04:07:38,470 --> 04:07:39,210
Okay.

6280
04:07:40,050 --> 04:07:40,950
Come on.

6281
04:07:41,150 --> 04:07:42,830
Come on.

6282
04:07:43,690 --> 04:07:44,370
Come on.

6283
04:07:44,910 --> 04:07:45,310
Okay.

6284
04:07:45,530 --> 04:07:46,130
We'll reverse.

6285
04:07:47,030 --> 04:07:47,830
And then...

6286
04:07:48,530 --> 04:07:50,030
Put it all the way down.

6287
04:07:51,310 --> 04:07:52,830
And then stick it in the hole.

6288
04:07:53,410 --> 04:07:54,290
Stick it in the hole.

6289
04:07:54,490 --> 04:07:55,170
Why aren't you...

6290
04:07:55,170 --> 04:07:55,850
Okay.

6291
04:07:55,910 --> 04:07:56,710
Give me a sec.

6292
04:07:56,930 --> 04:07:58,810
I need to align the forklift.

6293
04:07:59,350 --> 04:07:59,750
Okay.

6294
04:08:00,070 --> 04:08:01,150
In the hole you go.

6295
04:08:01,910 --> 04:08:02,570
There you go.

6296
04:08:03,710 --> 04:08:04,110
Nice.

6297
04:08:04,970 --> 04:08:05,370
Alright.

6298
04:08:05,430 --> 04:08:06,250
Where do I go now?

6299
04:08:07,870 --> 04:08:09,610
Guys, where was I supposed to go?

6300
04:08:09,930 --> 04:08:10,710
Do I just...

6301
04:08:10,710 --> 04:08:12,270
Do I just put it in there?

6302
04:08:13,250 --> 04:08:13,990
I forgot.

6303
04:08:14,030 --> 04:08:14,770
What was my job?

6304
04:08:15,330 --> 04:08:16,990
Guys, what was my job?

6305
04:08:19,310 --> 04:08:20,010
Do I...

6306
04:08:20,010 --> 04:08:21,410
Do I just put it...

6307
04:08:21,410 --> 04:08:21,810
I for...

6308
04:08:21,810 --> 04:08:22,870
What was my job?

6309
04:08:22,870 --> 04:08:23,870
I don't remember.

6310
04:08:25,730 --> 04:08:27,190
I was too busy.

6311
04:08:30,250 --> 04:08:31,090
Is it here?

6312
04:08:32,070 --> 04:08:33,190
Do I take it outside?

6313
04:08:34,810 --> 04:08:36,930
Oh, this wasn't the thing I was supposed to do.

6314
04:08:37,750 --> 04:08:38,390
Oh, wait.

6315
04:08:38,430 --> 04:08:39,450
This isn't even the item.

6316
04:08:39,590 --> 04:08:40,010
Okay.

6317
04:08:40,110 --> 04:08:40,470
Okay.

6318
04:08:40,570 --> 04:08:41,090
Get off.

6319
04:08:41,310 --> 04:08:41,970
Get off.

6320
04:08:42,830 --> 04:08:43,230
Get off.

6321
04:08:44,450 --> 04:08:45,230
Get off.

6322
04:08:45,390 --> 04:08:45,610
Okay.

6323
04:08:45,690 --> 04:08:45,930
Nice.

6324
04:08:46,070 --> 04:08:46,910
No, no, no, no, no.

6325
04:08:46,910 --> 04:08:47,170
Fuck.

6326
04:08:47,270 --> 04:08:47,570
Okay.

6327
04:08:47,610 --> 04:08:48,010
Okay.

6328
04:08:48,090 --> 04:08:48,790
Four more collisions.

6329
04:08:48,890 --> 04:08:49,390
That's okay.

6330
04:08:50,010 --> 04:08:51,910
This wasn't the original item.

6331
04:08:52,030 --> 04:08:53,210
The item's outside.

6332
04:08:54,530 --> 04:08:55,230
All right.

6333
04:08:55,390 --> 04:08:58,530
If I get one box, guys.

6334
04:08:59,290 --> 04:09:06,070
If I manage to succeed at putting this box up there, that's all we need.

6335
04:09:08,230 --> 04:09:08,950
Oh, nice.

6336
04:09:09,590 --> 04:09:10,110
Nice.

6337
04:09:10,810 --> 04:09:11,330
Okay.

6338
04:09:11,530 --> 04:09:12,030
One more.

6339
04:09:12,430 --> 04:09:12,830
Okay.

6340
04:09:12,830 --> 04:09:13,070
Where am I?

6341
04:09:13,290 --> 04:09:13,970
All right.

6342
04:09:15,030 --> 04:09:15,650
Oh.

6343
04:09:16,140 --> 04:09:16,450
Oh.

6344
04:09:16,510 --> 04:09:16,790
Oh.

6345
04:09:18,250 --> 04:09:18,870
Please.

6346
04:09:19,690 --> 04:09:20,310
No!

6347
04:09:21,770 --> 04:09:24,270
How am I supposed to feed charity?

6348
04:09:25,390 --> 04:09:26,010
No!

6349
04:09:30,420 --> 04:09:31,040
Guys!

6350
04:09:31,740 --> 04:09:35,520
How am I supposed to do charity, guys?

6351
04:09:36,340 --> 04:09:38,080
I don't understand!

6352
04:09:39,860 --> 04:09:40,480
Okay.

6353
04:09:40,500 --> 04:09:40,660
Wait.

6354
04:09:40,700 --> 04:09:40,800
Wait.

6355
04:09:40,800 --> 04:09:41,240
This is it.

6356
04:09:41,240 --> 04:09:42,680
I just need one item.

6357
04:09:42,880 --> 04:09:45,820
I just need one item.

6358
04:09:46,740 --> 04:09:47,900
That's all I need.

6359
04:09:48,200 --> 04:09:49,860
It does not matter.

6360
04:09:50,380 --> 04:09:52,880
As long as I get one item.

6361
04:09:55,080 --> 04:09:55,720
Okay.

6362
04:09:58,200 --> 04:09:59,700
Okay, now reverse.

6363
04:10:00,100 --> 04:10:01,520
I'm gonna line this better.

6364
04:10:02,240 --> 04:10:04,340
It's all about one item.

6365
04:10:05,460 --> 04:10:06,100
Okay.

6366
04:10:07,080 --> 04:10:07,720
Alright.

6367
04:10:07,720 --> 04:10:08,080
Oh.

6368
04:10:09,040 --> 04:10:10,100
Down you go.

6369
04:10:10,180 --> 04:10:10,720
Down, down.

6370
04:10:11,380 --> 04:10:12,060
Okay.

6371
04:10:12,320 --> 04:10:13,160
Come on.

6372
04:10:13,320 --> 04:10:14,780
Come on, get in the hole!

6373
04:10:15,820 --> 04:10:17,680
I need to be forklift certified!

6374
04:10:19,180 --> 04:10:20,220
This is it.

6375
04:10:24,800 --> 04:10:25,480
Please.

6376
04:10:25,480 --> 04:10:26,580
No, please.

6377
04:10:29,840 --> 04:10:30,520
Why?

6378
04:10:30,520 --> 04:10:32,200
Where is it?

6379
04:10:33,000 --> 04:10:33,680
Where?

6380
04:10:38,080 --> 04:10:39,120
This has to be it.

6381
04:10:39,540 --> 04:10:40,260
Is it up?

6382
04:10:40,620 --> 04:10:41,700
Oh my god, please.

6383
04:10:43,460 --> 04:10:47,780
Okay, if I go down more and then... Why?

6384
04:10:47,940 --> 04:10:48,380
Why?

6385
04:10:49,680 --> 04:10:50,120
Alright.

6386
04:10:52,720 --> 04:10:53,360
There we go.

6387
04:10:53,700 --> 04:10:54,140
No.

6388
04:10:54,800 --> 04:10:55,240
No.

6389
04:10:55,540 --> 04:10:56,440
It's underneath!

6390
04:10:56,940 --> 04:10:58,660
What do you all still want from me?

6391
04:11:00,280 --> 04:11:00,720
Okay.

6392
04:11:00,720 --> 04:11:01,160
Okay.

6393
04:11:01,240 --> 04:11:02,660
I'm slowly dragging it.

6394
04:11:03,280 --> 04:11:04,980
Alright, then we go forward.

6395
04:11:06,540 --> 04:11:07,260
Wait, wait.

6396
04:11:07,300 --> 04:11:07,620
It's up!

6397
04:11:07,620 --> 04:11:07,620
Oh!

6398
04:11:07,620 --> 04:11:08,160
It's up!

6399
04:11:10,640 --> 04:11:11,740
Oh my god.

6400
04:11:11,780 --> 04:11:12,260
I'm holding it.

6401
04:11:12,760 --> 04:11:13,480
Oh fuck.

6402
04:11:13,620 --> 04:11:13,780
Okay.

6403
04:11:14,500 --> 04:11:18,620
I'm trying to... I'm looking at my rear view mirror.

6404
04:11:21,460 --> 04:11:21,960
Okay.

6405
04:11:22,760 --> 04:11:24,020
My rear view mirror.

6406
04:11:24,220 --> 04:11:25,120
Why am I not there?

6407
04:11:25,940 --> 04:11:27,060
Why am I not there?

6408
04:11:27,160 --> 04:11:27,360
Okay.

6409
04:11:28,060 --> 04:11:28,560
Alright.

6410
04:11:30,520 --> 04:11:31,320
Here we go.

6411
04:11:33,680 --> 04:11:34,180
No.

6412
04:11:34,180 --> 04:11:34,840
It's okay.

6413
04:11:34,920 --> 04:11:36,400
We haven't had any collision!

6414
04:11:38,260 --> 04:11:39,160
Oh-DBâc!

6415
04:11:39,160 --> 04:11:39,420
Oh!

6416
04:11:39,680 --> 04:11:40,280
Oh!

6417
04:11:40,760 --> 04:11:41,360
Oh!

6418
04:11:42,020 --> 04:11:43,040
Alright, that's okay.

6419
04:11:43,140 --> 04:11:43,700
One is fine.

6420
04:11:43,840 --> 04:11:44,780
One collision is fine.

6421
04:11:44,860 --> 04:11:45,440
We're not perfect.

6422
04:11:45,920 --> 04:11:47,040
Alright, here we go.

6423
04:11:47,600 --> 04:11:50,820
And then we put it over there.

6424
04:11:52,140 --> 04:11:55,620
Why is there this one box blocking my way?

6425
04:11:57,280 --> 04:11:58,220
Get out!

6426
04:12:00,680 --> 04:12:02,940
Get this box out of here!

6427
04:12:05,260 --> 04:12:05,860
Okay.

6428
04:12:05,860 --> 04:12:06,460
Nice.

6429
04:12:07,580 --> 04:12:09,440
And then we put it here.

6430
04:12:10,100 --> 04:12:12,500
And then we tuck it out.

6431
04:12:15,520 --> 04:12:15,960
Okay.

6432
04:12:15,960 --> 04:12:16,400
Reverse.

6433
04:12:16,800 --> 04:12:17,580
I'm stuck.

6434
04:12:18,960 --> 04:12:19,840
I'm stuck.

6435
04:12:21,220 --> 04:12:21,660
Please!

6436
04:12:23,360 --> 04:12:23,800
Please.

6437
04:12:24,680 --> 04:12:26,480
Please just let me out.

6438
04:12:27,160 --> 04:12:27,960
Let me out.

6439
04:12:28,100 --> 04:12:29,260
Let me just place one.

6440
04:12:30,820 --> 04:12:31,660
That's all I ask.

6441
04:12:31,880 --> 04:12:32,440
No, no, no, no.

6442
04:12:33,860 --> 04:12:35,420
I just want to put one in there.

6443
04:12:35,920 --> 04:12:36,360
Okay.

6444
04:12:36,940 --> 04:12:37,820
And then...

6445
04:12:39,160 --> 04:12:40,180
Oh my god, please.

6446
04:12:41,420 --> 04:12:41,860
Please.

6447
04:12:43,000 --> 04:12:44,800
Please just go in the hole!

6448
04:12:45,600 --> 04:12:47,340
Put it down and rotate.

6449
04:12:47,760 --> 04:12:48,700
Are you the one...

6450
04:12:49,940 --> 04:12:51,220
Oh, wait, wait.

6451
04:12:51,280 --> 04:12:51,640
It's off.

6452
04:12:52,300 --> 04:12:52,920
It's off.

6453
04:12:53,480 --> 04:12:53,920
Okay.

6454
04:12:55,540 --> 04:12:57,160
Alright, just leave.

6455
04:12:58,140 --> 04:12:58,580
Leave.

6456
04:12:58,580 --> 04:12:59,080
That's all.

6457
04:12:59,200 --> 04:13:00,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

6458
04:13:02,880 --> 04:13:04,160
Anyway, I think...

6459
04:13:11,890 --> 04:13:13,470
I think like...

6460
04:13:13,470 --> 04:13:19,090
I think like, judging by how good I was at this...

6461
04:13:19,090 --> 04:13:20,170
Um...

6462
04:13:20,170 --> 04:13:20,790
Uh...

6463
04:13:26,230 --> 04:13:27,110
Guys,

6464
04:13:32,590 --> 04:13:37,930
I think like, after seeing how good I was at...

6465
04:13:37,930 --> 04:13:40,970
At, you know, online...

6466
04:13:40,970 --> 04:13:43,710
I feel like online...

6467
04:13:43,710 --> 04:13:46,010
With the ability...

6468
04:13:46,010 --> 04:13:46,450
Uh...

6469
04:13:46,450 --> 04:13:47,710
We're so...

6470
04:13:47,710 --> 04:13:49,290
We're so locked in.

6471
04:13:49,490 --> 04:13:54,070
Honestly, like, judging by like, my hand-eye coordination...

6472
04:13:54,070 --> 04:13:56,430
Online with Forklift...

6473
04:13:56,430 --> 04:13:58,350
Like, I feel like...

6474
04:13:58,350 --> 04:14:02,390
I honestly feel like if I took the test right now...

6475
04:14:02,390 --> 04:14:03,630
I could...

6476
04:14:03,630 --> 04:14:04,770
I...

6477
04:14:04,770 --> 04:14:07,190
I could easily...

6478
04:14:07,190 --> 04:14:09,110
Get Forklift certified.

6479
04:14:15,370 --> 04:14:16,590
I am...

6480
04:14:16,590 --> 04:14:21,610
I am like, 100% so fucking confident...

6481
04:14:21,610 --> 04:14:22,750
That like...

6482
04:14:22,750 --> 04:14:25,490
Judging from like, the simulation...

6483
04:14:26,430 --> 04:14:27,530
There is...

6484
04:14:27,530 --> 04:14:30,050
No way I could fail the test.

6485
04:14:30,450 --> 04:14:31,750
Like, I feel like...

6486
04:14:31,750 --> 04:14:34,050
I felt like I was a fucking prodigy.

6487
04:14:38,010 --> 04:14:38,670
I...

6488
04:14:38,980 --> 04:14:41,030
I don't know about you...

6489
04:14:41,030 --> 04:14:43,950
But I felt like a fucking prodigy.

6490
04:14:44,370 --> 04:14:44,970
Hehehehehehe...

6491
04:14:57,010 --> 04:14:58,570
Sorry, I did not eat some chicken.

6492
04:14:58,770 --> 04:14:59,970
I had to...

6493
04:14:59,970 --> 04:15:02,530
If not because of the Forklift...

6494
04:15:02,530 --> 04:15:04,790
That I stress ate, guys...

6495
04:15:04,790 --> 04:15:05,690
Guys...

6496
04:15:05,690 --> 04:15:08,270
Just want you guys to know...

6497
04:15:09,250 --> 04:15:11,690
I was not stress eating...

6498
04:15:11,690 --> 04:15:13,890
Because of the Forklift...

6499
04:15:13,890 --> 04:15:14,550
Hehehehehe...

6500
04:15:14,550 --> 04:15:16,710
I was just...

6501
04:15:16,710 --> 04:15:18,790
I was just very hungry.

6502
04:15:19,190 --> 04:15:21,110
Okay, it has no correlation.

6503
04:15:21,810 --> 04:15:24,150
Guys, there was no correlation...

6504
04:15:24,150 --> 04:15:26,790
Between me eating the chicken...

6505
04:15:27,390 --> 04:15:28,110
Hehehehehe...

6506
04:15:29,130 --> 04:15:29,850
And...

6507
04:15:29,850 --> 04:15:30,110
And...

6508
04:15:30,110 --> 04:15:32,550
And operating the Forklift.

6509
04:15:32,850 --> 04:15:34,750
No correlation at all.

6510
04:15:45,110 --> 04:15:46,690
I feel like...

6511
04:15:49,020 --> 04:15:50,780
I feel like I can...

6512
04:15:50,780 --> 04:15:51,440
I can do it.

6513
04:15:51,580 --> 04:15:52,460
I feel like...

6514
04:15:52,460 --> 04:15:53,020
After...

6515
04:15:53,020 --> 04:15:53,120
After...

6516
04:15:53,120 --> 04:15:54,740
Seeing my progress...

6517
04:15:54,740 --> 04:15:55,820
And operating that...

6518
04:15:55,820 --> 04:15:56,660
It's not that difficult.

6519
04:15:56,780 --> 04:15:57,540
It's like driving a car.

6520
04:15:57,740 --> 04:15:59,580
Which I haven't drove in like 10 years.

6521
04:15:59,720 --> 04:16:00,060
But it's like...

6522
04:16:00,060 --> 04:16:00,960
It's like driving a car.

6523
04:16:02,420 --> 04:16:02,860
Hehehehehehe...

6524
04:16:02,860 --> 04:16:03,040
Hehehehehehe...

6525
04:16:04,020 --> 04:16:05,760
I haven't touched a car in 10 years.

6526
04:16:05,840 --> 04:16:06,420
Like, you know...

6527
04:16:06,420 --> 04:16:07,320
Behind the driver's seat.

6528
04:16:07,400 --> 04:16:08,500
But I'm pretty sure...

6529
04:16:09,120 --> 04:16:10,340
It's like riding a bicycle.

6530
04:16:11,500 --> 04:16:13,200
Which I also haven't ridden...

6531
04:16:13,200 --> 04:16:14,320
In 20 years.

6532
04:16:15,100 --> 04:16:15,540
But...

6533
04:16:15,540 --> 04:16:16,480
It's like walking.

6534
04:16:18,600 --> 04:16:19,040
Hehehehehehe...

6535
04:16:20,700 --> 04:16:21,140
Hehehehehehe...

6536
04:16:22,560 --> 04:16:23,000
Hehehehehehe...

6537
04:16:25,860 --> 04:16:28,100
So, handling a Forklift...

6538
04:16:28,100 --> 04:16:30,480
It's almost as an equivalent...

6539
04:16:30,480 --> 04:16:31,100
To walking.

6540
04:16:32,180 --> 04:16:33,040
I can feel it.

6541
04:16:35,060 --> 04:16:37,140
Honestly, it's gonna be so fucking easy.

6542
04:16:37,420 --> 04:16:39,420
It's gonna be so easy.

6543
04:16:40,180 --> 04:16:40,900
Hehehehehe...

6544
04:16:40,900 --> 04:16:44,660
There's nothing to worry about.

6545
04:16:45,020 --> 04:16:48,360
There's absolutely nothing to worry about.

6546
04:16:48,380 --> 04:16:49,980
I don't know why you guys are...

6547
04:16:49,980 --> 04:16:52,540
Are freaking out right now.

6548
04:16:52,760 --> 04:16:53,480
Hehehehehe...

6549
04:16:54,360 --> 04:16:55,080
Hehehehehehe...

6550
04:16:55,980 --> 04:16:57,900
Is sooo simple.

6551
04:16:58,280 --> 04:16:58,900
Hehehehehe...

6552
04:16:58,900 --> 04:17:01,900
Let's check on the auction real quick.

6553
04:17:03,400 --> 04:17:04,140
Hehehehehe...

6554
04:17:04,140 --> 04:17:06,660
Guys, please don't judge me here.

6555
04:17:06,860 --> 04:17:08,660
This is a judge-free zone.

6556
04:17:10,170 --> 04:17:13,400
This is absolutely a judge-free zone.

6557
04:17:14,220 --> 04:17:15,240
Right now.

6558
04:17:16,600 --> 04:17:19,420
So it's pretty fucked up if you're judging me.

6559
04:17:19,900 --> 04:17:20,640
Hehehehehehehe.

6560
04:17:21,620 --> 04:17:22,360
Hehehehehe...

6561
04:17:23,360 --> 04:17:24,100
Hehehehehehe...

6562
04:17:26,080 --> 04:17:27,940
Please, please stop judging.

6563
04:17:29,460 --> 04:17:30,740
Oh my gosh, alright.

6564
04:17:30,900 --> 04:17:31,840
Where was I?

6565
04:17:31,980 --> 04:17:32,300
Okay.

6566
04:17:32,660 --> 04:17:34,080
Okay, I actually...

6567
04:17:38,420 --> 04:17:43,320
I actually was planning on doing the stream for another hour.

6568
04:17:43,840 --> 04:17:50,980
So, I will let you guys pick what you want to do for the last hour.

6569
04:17:54,860 --> 04:17:59,480
Because my stream stamina is going down now.

6570
04:18:03,800 --> 04:18:05,640
So, this time...

6571
04:18:05,640 --> 04:18:08,900
I'm not doing the forklift thing again because I know I'm a prodigy.

6572
04:18:09,040 --> 04:18:10,980
I know I'm a prodigy right now.

6573
04:18:11,060 --> 04:18:15,300
I could do a custom server for you guys in Apex if that's what you guys really want.

6574
04:18:15,460 --> 04:18:16,280
Is that what you guys want?

6575
04:18:16,600 --> 04:18:18,100
You guys want a custom server?

6576
04:18:18,220 --> 04:18:19,680
We'll do one regular game.

6577
04:18:20,400 --> 04:18:22,180
And one regular game.

6578
04:18:22,540 --> 04:18:23,540
And one...

6579
04:18:24,780 --> 04:18:27,220
And one fun game.

6580
04:18:27,540 --> 04:18:29,700
I think... I don't know what a fun game would be.

6581
04:18:29,980 --> 04:18:30,920
The melee.

6582
04:18:31,160 --> 04:18:33,080
The melee one has always been so fun.

6583
04:18:33,140 --> 04:18:34,320
I fucking love the melee.

6584
04:18:37,040 --> 04:18:40,840
Alright guys, we'll do two games of Apex, guys.

6585
04:18:41,280 --> 04:18:43,560
We'll do two games of Apex.

6586
04:18:43,600 --> 04:18:47,260
Let me swap over... Let me boot up Apex real fast.

6587
04:18:47,660 --> 04:18:48,540
Apex time!

6588
04:18:48,740 --> 04:18:49,860
It's Apex!

6589
04:18:49,860 --> 04:18:50,260
Apex!

6590
04:18:52,900 --> 04:18:53,500
Alright.

6591
04:18:54,300 --> 04:18:55,440
Apex time!

6592
04:18:57,640 --> 04:18:59,260
I haven't played Apex in a while.

6593
04:19:00,700 --> 04:19:01,960
I don't remember.

6594
04:19:02,200 --> 04:19:03,400
When did I last touch Apex?

6595
04:19:07,580 --> 04:19:07,880
Alright.

6596
04:19:08,020 --> 04:19:12,480
Okay, we gotta turn down the volume though.

6597
04:19:12,540 --> 04:19:12,840
Whoa!

6598
04:19:13,680 --> 04:19:14,280
Alright.

6599
04:19:14,600 --> 04:19:15,200
Apex.

6600
04:19:20,930 --> 04:19:21,530
Apex.

6601
04:19:21,530 --> 04:19:21,770
Apex.

6602
04:19:23,410 --> 04:19:24,290
Apex leggings.

6603
04:19:27,470 --> 04:19:28,490
Alright, let's see.

6604
04:19:28,890 --> 04:19:29,570
This one.

6605
04:19:29,630 --> 04:19:30,930
The first game will be serious.

6606
04:19:31,630 --> 04:19:32,810
Okay, create a match.

6607
04:19:34,070 --> 04:19:35,010
Alright, you guys ready?

6608
04:19:35,990 --> 04:19:40,390
I'm gonna... You guys have to type the... Oh wait, I was gonna say you guys won't be able to see the code.

6609
04:19:40,670 --> 04:19:41,470
Because every...

6610
04:19:41,470 --> 04:19:43,930
All my overlays covering up!

6611
04:19:46,710 --> 04:19:50,330
All the overlays are covering up the fucking game.

6612
04:19:50,330 --> 04:19:51,930
I don't even know the code.

6613
04:19:52,130 --> 04:19:54,230
Alright, 3, 2, 1!

6614
04:19:55,090 --> 04:19:55,650
Boop!

6615
04:19:55,830 --> 04:19:56,730
Here's the code.

6616
04:19:57,070 --> 04:19:58,650
So you remember to...

6617
04:20:00,150 --> 04:20:05,110
You remember to turn... This time I actually will turn off the audio because I don't trust you guys!

6618
04:20:10,370 --> 04:20:14,410
I don't trust you guys so I made sure that...

6619
04:20:14,410 --> 04:20:15,030
Aiden!

6620
04:20:15,490 --> 04:20:17,990
You think you can... You have the privilege?

6621
04:20:18,310 --> 04:20:19,190
I can...

6622
04:20:20,910 --> 04:20:22,890
Get all the top donors and then...

6623
04:20:22,890 --> 04:20:24,450
No, that would be so fucked up!

6624
04:20:24,590 --> 04:20:25,350
I mean like...

6625
04:20:25,350 --> 04:20:27,090
You think I let you on my team?

6626
04:20:27,270 --> 04:20:28,790
You're not top 5 donors!

6627
04:20:29,210 --> 04:20:30,210
I won't do that.

6628
04:20:30,350 --> 04:20:31,130
I won't do that.

6629
04:20:31,170 --> 04:20:32,910
That's so fucked up for me to do!

6630
04:20:35,590 --> 04:20:37,130
That's so fucked up!

6631
04:20:41,010 --> 04:20:42,390
Guys, I'm not...

6632
04:20:42,390 --> 04:20:44,490
Guys, guys, it was a joke.

6633
04:20:44,830 --> 04:20:47,750
It was... I swear it was a joke guys.

6634
04:20:47,990 --> 04:20:49,410
It was a joke.

6635
04:20:50,330 --> 04:20:50,770
I mean...

6636
04:20:51,970 --> 04:20:52,570
Alright.

6637
04:20:53,470 --> 04:20:55,010
I will do two games.

6638
04:20:55,230 --> 04:20:56,190
We'll do two games.

6639
04:20:56,470 --> 04:20:59,190
This is why the system is the way it was!

6640
04:20:59,730 --> 04:21:01,090
Wait, you're both controller!

6641
04:21:01,510 --> 04:21:02,230
Wait, okay.

6642
04:21:03,890 --> 04:21:06,450
I forgot I can analyze the situation!

6643
04:21:14,680 --> 04:21:16,280
Oh shit, Cameron!

6644
04:21:24,220 --> 04:21:25,460
Oh my god!

6645
04:21:25,680 --> 04:21:25,980
Oh my god!

6646
04:21:26,080 --> 04:21:28,160
I'm just scouting, guys.

6647
04:21:28,500 --> 04:21:29,400
I'm just...

6648
04:21:29,400 --> 04:21:30,800
I'm just...

6649
04:21:30,800 --> 04:21:31,740
I'm scouting!

6650
04:21:32,300 --> 04:21:34,660
I'm just scouting the scenario!

6651
04:21:35,240 --> 04:21:36,020
Guys!

6652
04:21:36,820 --> 04:21:40,100
I'm just trying to scout out...

6653
04:21:41,320 --> 04:21:42,900
Like, what?

6654
04:21:43,020 --> 04:21:43,800
What?

6655
04:21:44,160 --> 04:21:45,560
What did I do?

6656
04:21:45,980 --> 04:21:47,960
What did I do, chat?

6657
04:21:48,060 --> 04:21:49,280
I don't understand.

6658
04:21:49,840 --> 04:21:50,500
What?

6659
04:21:50,580 --> 04:21:50,920
What?

6660
04:21:50,920 --> 04:21:51,360
What?

6661
04:21:51,360 --> 04:21:51,960
What?

6662
04:21:51,960 --> 04:21:53,460
What did I do?

6663
04:21:53,540 --> 04:21:54,600
I was just analyzing!

6664
04:21:55,880 --> 04:21:58,380
Oh, is analyzing wrong now?

6665
04:22:03,720 --> 04:22:06,280
When was that illegal, chat?

6666
04:22:06,640 --> 04:22:09,640
When was that illegal to do?

6667
04:22:11,460 --> 04:22:13,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

6668
04:22:15,740 --> 04:22:16,740
Alright, let's see.

6669
04:22:16,800 --> 04:22:18,960
I'm gonna help put you guys in teams real fast.

6670
04:22:21,960 --> 04:22:22,840
Alright, we have...

6671
04:22:22,840 --> 04:22:25,120
We have a few more spaces left.

6672
04:22:25,640 --> 04:22:26,820
We have...

6673
04:22:26,820 --> 04:22:27,420
Oh, okay.

6674
04:22:27,480 --> 04:22:28,640
Let's put you guys in here.

6675
04:22:29,260 --> 04:22:31,140
We have two more spaces.

6676
04:22:31,360 --> 04:22:32,900
We have one space left, chat.

6677
04:22:33,540 --> 04:22:34,040
Oh!

6678
04:22:34,100 --> 04:22:35,200
Oh, one more space.

6679
04:22:35,360 --> 04:22:36,120
And then...

6680
04:22:36,120 --> 04:22:36,320
Alright!

6681
04:22:36,440 --> 04:22:38,820
This will be a regular game.

6682
04:22:39,260 --> 04:22:41,080
We'll do World's Edge, because it's my favorite.

6683
04:22:41,900 --> 04:22:49,460
Namus, Murad, Av, Amos' self-assigned team, Allao, All, Battle Royale trios, Gunrun, Team Deathmatch...

6684
04:22:49,460 --> 04:22:49,960
Okay, yes.

6685
04:22:50,440 --> 04:22:50,900
Alright.

6686
04:22:51,740 --> 04:22:52,520
Alright, guys.

6687
04:22:53,460 --> 04:22:54,240
Here we go.

6688
04:22:54,360 --> 04:22:57,920
We're gonna start a match in three, two, one.

6689
04:22:58,900 --> 04:23:02,320
I don't remember how to play.

6690
04:23:03,140 --> 04:23:04,360
I don't even know what's meta.

6691
04:23:04,580 --> 04:23:05,440
Wait, no, I do!

6692
04:23:05,580 --> 04:23:06,460
It's Bloodhound!

6693
04:23:06,720 --> 04:23:07,560
Wait, is it Bloodhound?

6694
04:23:07,760 --> 04:23:09,380
It's like Caustic some shit.

6695
04:23:09,660 --> 04:23:11,160
It's like Bloodhound.

6696
04:23:11,280 --> 04:23:11,980
Oh, wait.

6697
04:23:13,120 --> 04:23:13,580
Here.

6698
04:23:17,020 --> 04:23:18,140
You're so lucky.

6699
04:23:18,480 --> 04:23:19,740
You're so lucky.

6700
04:23:19,740 --> 04:23:21,120
I stopped for you.

6701
04:23:24,140 --> 04:23:24,620
Alright.

6702
04:23:25,500 --> 04:23:26,280
This is it.

6703
04:23:31,330 --> 04:23:33,450
I'm sorry I didn't have a lot of stream stamina.

6704
04:23:34,230 --> 04:23:39,590
Really, the whole thing I really wanted to focus on was the auction itself.

6705
04:23:40,690 --> 04:23:44,970
Like, a lot of the energy was put on organizing the auction.

6706
04:23:45,250 --> 04:23:47,410
But I still hope you guys enjoyed the stream so far.

6707
04:23:47,590 --> 04:23:51,470
Of just like, hanging out, talking, knowing about...

6708
04:23:51,470 --> 04:23:51,770
Oh, shit.

6709
04:23:51,770 --> 04:23:52,770
Uh, fuck.

6710
04:23:52,950 --> 04:23:54,290
I heard Caustic was meta now.

6711
04:23:54,490 --> 04:23:55,530
Where's Bloodhound meta?

6712
04:23:55,650 --> 04:23:56,190
I don't remember.

6713
04:24:01,850 --> 04:24:03,510
Doki, we have no teammate.

6714
04:24:04,830 --> 04:24:05,350
Well...

6715
04:24:06,250 --> 04:24:07,430
Sucks to be you.

6716
04:24:12,770 --> 04:24:14,230
I'm working on...

6717
04:24:14,230 --> 04:24:15,430
What do you want me to do?

6718
04:24:15,430 --> 04:24:20,510
What do you want me to do?

6719
04:24:20,510 --> 04:24:20,930
You know you're doing...

6720
04:24:20,930 --> 04:24:23,870
Alright, guys.

6721
04:24:26,970 --> 04:24:27,770
Jumper kick.

6722
04:24:28,770 --> 04:24:30,150
Cameron, I swear to god.

6723
04:24:30,210 --> 04:24:32,510
If you do not be jumpmaster...

6724
04:24:32,510 --> 04:24:33,630
If you do not be jump...

6725
04:24:33,630 --> 04:24:34,110
If you...

6726
04:24:34,110 --> 04:24:37,530
None of you guys be jumpmaster, I will end this game right now.

6727
04:24:41,230 --> 04:24:45,230
I will stop this game right now.

6728
04:24:45,370 --> 04:24:47,150
If none of you jump.

6729
04:24:51,710 --> 04:24:54,550
I was swapped you away from my team.

6730
04:24:54,730 --> 04:24:58,010
I will fucking find another masters player.

6731
04:25:00,550 --> 04:25:02,950
I can analyze again.

6732
04:25:03,870 --> 04:25:06,590
I look how I've jumped fucking emotes now.

6733
04:25:09,970 --> 04:25:10,930
Typical Doki.

6734
04:25:10,930 --> 04:25:11,710
What do you mean?

6735
04:25:12,730 --> 04:25:14,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

6736
04:25:14,170 --> 04:25:14,730
I'm just saying.

6737
04:25:15,110 --> 04:25:16,990
I didn't mean I would do it now.

6738
04:25:22,230 --> 04:25:22,710
Alright.

6739
04:25:22,710 --> 04:25:23,410
We're fine.

6740
04:25:24,890 --> 04:25:26,250
Everything will be fine.

6741
04:25:26,550 --> 04:25:27,390
If you guys didn't know.

6742
04:25:27,730 --> 04:25:29,410
If you see like a...

6743
04:25:31,470 --> 04:25:34,510
If you see like a crow near you.

6744
04:25:34,970 --> 04:25:36,510
It means there's no one near you.

6745
04:25:37,410 --> 04:25:40,490
Crows usually are meant for like people far away.

6746
04:25:40,790 --> 04:25:43,050
But they know where the general direction is.

6747
04:25:43,270 --> 04:25:44,390
They're just not close by.

6748
04:25:44,690 --> 04:25:47,030
So like I'm not too worried about that.

6749
04:25:48,530 --> 04:25:50,130
R9 fucking sucks though.

6750
04:25:50,190 --> 04:25:50,830
Fuck man.

6751
04:25:51,110 --> 04:25:52,630
I wish the R9 is better.

6752
04:25:53,090 --> 04:25:54,510
Those poor teammates.

6753
04:25:54,750 --> 04:25:56,190
They should be honored!

6754
04:25:57,230 --> 04:25:58,490
What do you mean?

6755
04:26:01,830 --> 04:26:02,390
Alright.

6756
04:26:02,590 --> 04:26:03,470
I don't wanna...

6757
04:26:03,470 --> 04:26:04,230
Okay.

6758
04:26:04,830 --> 04:26:05,670
We can...

6759
04:26:05,670 --> 04:26:07,830
We need like better armor.

6760
04:26:08,190 --> 04:26:08,550
Wait.

6761
04:26:08,590 --> 04:26:10,070
Do we have anybody that can scan?

6762
04:26:12,030 --> 04:26:12,690
Oh wait.

6763
04:26:12,770 --> 04:26:12,890
What?

6764
04:26:12,990 --> 04:26:13,330
Okay.

6765
04:26:13,410 --> 04:26:15,230
Who the fuck is over there right now?

6766
04:26:15,490 --> 04:26:16,470
What are you doing?

6767
04:26:16,690 --> 04:26:17,890
What are you doing?

6768
04:26:18,690 --> 04:26:19,050
Huh?

6769
04:26:22,370 --> 04:26:23,450
What are you doing?

6770
04:26:24,350 --> 04:26:25,490
What are you doing?

6771
04:26:27,110 --> 04:26:29,690
Did he accidentally land in the wrong area?

6772
04:26:32,980 --> 04:26:33,500
Bro.

6773
04:26:34,920 --> 04:26:35,440
Wait.

6774
04:26:35,500 --> 04:26:35,800
He's solo!

6775
04:26:36,040 --> 04:26:36,860
Go Cameron!

6776
04:26:37,200 --> 04:26:37,700
Go!

6777
04:26:38,820 --> 04:26:40,220
Cameron don't be a little pussy!

6778
04:26:40,460 --> 04:26:41,000
You're masters!

6779
04:26:41,500 --> 04:26:42,780
You're console masters.

6780
04:26:43,500 --> 04:26:44,620
Play your part.

6781
04:26:45,580 --> 04:26:46,120
Okay.

6782
04:26:49,610 --> 04:26:50,790
I didn't see him.

6783
04:26:51,110 --> 04:26:52,450
I did not see him.

6784
04:26:55,930 --> 04:26:56,470
Look.

6785
04:26:58,610 --> 04:27:00,150
I didn't die though.

6786
04:27:00,390 --> 04:27:00,930
So...

6787
04:27:03,450 --> 04:27:03,990
Okay.

6788
04:27:04,190 --> 04:27:05,290
This teammate is coming over.

6789
04:27:05,490 --> 04:27:06,010
Guys.

6790
04:27:06,030 --> 04:27:06,830
This teammate is coming.

6791
04:27:10,350 --> 04:27:10,610
No!

6792
04:27:10,610 --> 04:27:11,130
He's one!

6793
04:27:11,290 --> 04:27:12,170
He's literally one!

6794
04:27:12,330 --> 04:27:12,630
Guys.

6795
04:27:12,750 --> 04:27:13,430
I swear to God.

6796
04:27:13,490 --> 04:27:14,370
He's literally...

6797
04:27:14,370 --> 04:27:14,630
Guys!

6798
04:27:14,890 --> 04:27:15,910
I swear to God!

6799
04:27:16,070 --> 04:27:17,230
He's literally one!

6800
04:27:18,490 --> 04:27:19,530
Oh you fuck.

6801
04:27:19,870 --> 04:27:20,850
Oh my God.

6802
04:27:21,770 --> 04:27:22,290
Guys.

6803
04:27:24,650 --> 04:27:25,170
Please.

6804
04:27:25,170 --> 04:27:25,870
Thirst him.

6805
04:27:26,470 --> 04:27:27,750
Please thirst him for me.

6806
04:27:29,070 --> 04:27:29,590
Okay.

6807
04:27:29,930 --> 04:27:30,450
Alright.

6808
04:27:30,550 --> 04:27:30,970
We're okay.

6809
04:27:31,090 --> 04:27:31,510
We're okay.

6810
04:27:31,650 --> 04:27:32,710
We're okay.

6811
04:27:33,790 --> 04:27:34,670
We're okay.

6812
04:27:35,130 --> 04:27:35,930
We're okay.

6813
04:27:36,310 --> 04:27:37,490
Everything is fine.

6814
04:27:38,730 --> 04:27:40,210
Oh my God.

6815
04:27:40,370 --> 04:27:41,970
Oh my God.

6816
04:27:42,010 --> 04:27:42,210
Okay.

6817
04:27:44,610 --> 04:27:45,810
Everything is fine.

6818
04:27:46,370 --> 04:27:47,950
There's nothing to worry about.

6819
04:27:49,590 --> 04:27:50,850
Where is the guy we...

6820
04:27:50,850 --> 04:27:51,670
Oh what the fuck?

6821
04:27:51,830 --> 04:27:52,050
Okay.

6822
04:27:52,090 --> 04:27:53,950
Maybe not that fine now.

6823
04:27:54,990 --> 04:27:55,510
Wait.

6824
04:27:55,570 --> 04:27:56,750
Where is the guy we thirsted?

6825
04:27:57,330 --> 04:27:58,590
Did we not thirst him?

6826
04:28:01,290 --> 04:28:02,290
Did we not...

6827
04:28:02,290 --> 04:28:02,630
Okay.

6828
04:28:02,690 --> 04:28:04,810
Why is there so many people on us?

6829
04:28:05,250 --> 04:28:05,770
Okay.

6830
04:28:06,750 --> 04:28:07,270
Why is there so many people on us?

6831
04:28:07,270 --> 04:28:07,530
Alright.

6832
04:28:07,650 --> 04:28:08,430
I don't wanna...

6833
04:28:08,430 --> 04:28:10,290
I don't feel so good here.

6834
04:28:11,570 --> 04:28:12,470
Where's the vantage?

6835
04:28:12,650 --> 04:28:14,070
Where the fuck is the vantage?

6836
04:28:14,650 --> 04:28:15,370
He's over here.

6837
04:28:15,490 --> 04:28:15,730
Okay.

6838
04:28:15,850 --> 04:28:16,450
I'm gonna scan.

6839
04:28:16,670 --> 04:28:17,290
We scan.

6840
04:28:17,410 --> 04:28:19,050
He can't vantage all of us.

6841
04:28:19,410 --> 04:28:19,850
Guys.

6842
04:28:20,010 --> 04:28:20,450
Guys.

6843
04:28:20,510 --> 04:28:21,330
You have to remember.

6844
04:28:21,650 --> 04:28:23,550
He can't vantage all of us.

6845
04:28:26,790 --> 04:28:27,470
There we go.

6846
04:28:28,150 --> 04:28:28,590
Okay.

6847
04:28:28,650 --> 04:28:29,190
Are you guys ready?

6848
04:28:29,270 --> 04:28:30,130
We go in together.

6849
04:28:30,510 --> 04:28:30,950
Go.

6850
04:28:33,090 --> 04:28:35,210
There's no way he can vantage all of us.

6851
04:28:36,650 --> 04:28:37,250
There's no way he can vantage all of us.

6852
04:28:37,270 --> 04:28:38,630
I'm a firm believer of that.

6853
04:28:39,470 --> 04:28:40,650
There's no way.

6854
04:28:40,850 --> 04:28:41,610
That's right.

6855
04:28:41,710 --> 04:28:42,890
That's fucking right.

6856
04:28:42,990 --> 04:28:44,330
Run you little bitch!

6857
04:28:50,250 --> 04:28:51,650
That's fucking right.

6858
04:28:51,810 --> 04:28:53,510
You run you little coward.

6859
04:28:54,270 --> 04:28:57,390
I have all... I'm faster than you.

6860
04:28:59,290 --> 04:29:01,230
What the fuck are you doing though?

6861
04:29:02,390 --> 04:29:03,030
Please.

6862
04:29:07,290 --> 04:29:07,810
Okay.

6863
04:29:07,950 --> 04:29:10,370
I couldn't hit the fucking last shot.

6864
04:29:12,230 --> 04:29:13,070
I knew.

6865
04:29:13,410 --> 04:29:15,830
I knew you couldn't run forever.

6866
04:29:16,410 --> 04:29:16,470
I knew.

6867
04:29:16,470 --> 04:29:16,990
Okay.

6868
04:29:17,050 --> 04:29:17,850
Why are we even charged?

6869
04:29:18,150 --> 04:29:18,390
Okay.

6870
04:29:18,430 --> 04:29:18,850
That's good.

6871
04:29:19,430 --> 04:29:19,950
Look.

6872
04:29:20,030 --> 04:29:21,070
I haven't used the...

6873
04:29:21,590 --> 04:29:22,110
Guys.

6874
04:29:23,630 --> 04:29:23,830
Guys.

6875
04:29:23,870 --> 04:29:24,130
Guys.

6876
04:29:24,130 --> 04:29:24,510
Guys.

6877
04:29:26,760 --> 04:29:27,280
Guys.

6878
04:29:29,720 --> 04:29:30,240
Alright.

6879
04:29:30,400 --> 04:29:30,680
Nice.

6880
04:29:30,760 --> 04:29:31,000
Okay.

6881
04:29:31,460 --> 04:29:32,100
It's okay.

6882
04:29:32,200 --> 04:29:33,620
I have to heal here.

6883
04:29:34,040 --> 04:29:34,760
We're fine.

6884
04:29:34,900 --> 04:29:35,420
We're okay.

6885
04:29:35,880 --> 04:29:36,700
We're okay.

6886
04:29:37,100 --> 04:29:38,180
We're okay.

6887
04:29:41,540 --> 04:29:42,100
We're okay.

6888
04:29:42,940 --> 04:29:43,900
We are okay.

6889
04:29:43,960 --> 04:29:44,680
We're in zone.

6890
04:29:47,960 --> 04:29:48,520
Alright.

6891
04:29:48,620 --> 04:29:49,260
This is fine.

6892
04:29:50,040 --> 04:29:51,420
This is so fine.

6893
04:29:52,960 --> 04:29:54,300
You're on the high ground.

6894
04:29:57,660 --> 04:30:00,500
That would be so fucking cool if I landed that.

6895
04:30:00,900 --> 04:30:01,980
I got it.

6896
04:30:02,020 --> 04:30:02,280
If only.

6897
04:30:02,960 --> 04:30:03,820
If only.

6898
04:30:08,800 --> 04:30:09,800
My champion.

6899
04:30:11,060 --> 04:30:11,620
Oh!

6900
04:30:12,600 --> 04:30:13,180
Don't die.

6901
04:30:14,660 --> 04:30:15,060
Okay.

6902
04:30:15,140 --> 04:30:16,740
There are three men chilling down there.

6903
04:30:17,660 --> 04:30:18,060
Res.

6904
04:30:18,160 --> 04:30:18,360
Res.

6905
04:30:18,360 --> 04:30:18,560
Res.

6906
04:30:18,560 --> 04:30:18,720
Res.

6907
04:30:18,720 --> 04:30:19,100
I'll cover.

6908
04:30:19,220 --> 04:30:19,500
I'll cover.

6909
04:30:19,600 --> 04:30:19,860
Res.

6910
04:30:19,880 --> 04:30:20,080
Res.

6911
04:30:20,080 --> 04:30:20,340
Res.

6912
04:30:21,620 --> 04:30:22,020
Res.

6913
04:30:22,160 --> 04:30:22,800
I can cover this.

6914
04:30:24,660 --> 04:30:25,700
I can cover this.

6915
04:30:26,380 --> 04:30:27,280
Go high ground.

6916
04:30:28,000 --> 04:30:28,900
Say high ground.

6917
04:30:29,440 --> 04:30:30,640
They're coming down the stairs.

6918
04:30:30,740 --> 04:30:31,640
They're right down the stairs.

6919
04:30:31,740 --> 04:30:32,360
They're right down the stairs.

6920
04:30:36,710 --> 04:30:37,430
Oh my god.

6921
04:30:37,450 --> 04:30:37,650
Please.

6922
04:30:40,770 --> 04:30:41,710
Oh my god.

6923
04:30:41,770 --> 04:30:42,170
Please.

6924
04:30:42,250 --> 04:30:42,890
For the love of god.

6925
04:30:43,570 --> 04:30:43,970
Okay.

6926
04:30:46,530 --> 04:30:47,050
Alright.

6927
04:30:47,150 --> 04:30:47,150
Alright.

6928
04:30:47,730 --> 04:30:48,490
That's fine.

6929
04:30:48,730 --> 04:30:49,090
That's fine.

6930
04:30:50,270 --> 04:30:51,630
Literally one guy left.

6931
04:30:52,990 --> 04:30:53,510
Wait.

6932
04:30:53,550 --> 04:30:53,990
Where is he?

6933
04:30:54,490 --> 04:30:55,290
Where the fuck?

6934
04:30:55,470 --> 04:30:56,990
Where did he get shot?

6935
04:30:57,550 --> 04:30:58,070
Where?

6936
04:30:59,410 --> 04:30:59,930
What?

6937
04:31:01,470 --> 04:31:02,490
Where did you guys get shot?

6938
04:31:08,200 --> 04:31:09,440
He might be behind us.

6939
04:31:11,320 --> 04:31:13,120
I cannot res, guys.

6940
04:31:15,040 --> 04:31:16,840
I don't know where he is.

6941
04:31:17,340 --> 04:31:18,800
And that's why I'm scared.

6942
04:31:20,460 --> 04:31:23,360
I don't know where he is, guys.

6943
04:31:24,760 --> 04:31:25,280
I don't know where he is, guys.

6944
04:31:25,280 --> 04:31:25,960
I don't know where he is, guys.

6945
04:31:25,960 --> 04:31:26,460
No hostile?

6946
04:31:28,580 --> 04:31:29,900
Where the fuck is he?

6947
04:31:33,100 --> 04:31:33,620
Wait.

6948
04:31:33,660 --> 04:31:34,120
They res'd.

6949
04:31:34,180 --> 04:31:34,340
Wait.

6950
04:31:34,340 --> 04:31:34,340
They res'd.

6951
04:31:34,340 --> 04:31:34,920
Oh my god.

6952
04:31:34,940 --> 04:31:35,840
They res'd.

6953
04:31:36,920 --> 04:31:37,440
Okay.

6954
04:31:38,460 --> 04:31:39,580
They're like back there.

6955
04:31:39,580 --> 04:31:40,840
Alright, guys.

6956
04:31:41,060 --> 04:31:44,280
Guys, we have to camp these bodies so they get nothing.

6957
04:31:44,460 --> 04:31:45,440
That is our goal.

6958
04:31:45,740 --> 04:31:48,360
We gotta make sure they don't get anything.

6959
04:31:49,160 --> 04:31:49,180
We gotta make sure they don't get anything.

6960
04:31:49,180 --> 04:31:49,440
Heal!

6961
04:31:50,040 --> 04:31:50,560
Heal!

6962
04:31:50,900 --> 04:31:51,920
You're so low!

6963
04:31:52,060 --> 04:31:53,340
Here, take this phoenix kit!

6964
04:31:53,780 --> 04:31:54,300
Here!

6965
04:31:56,160 --> 04:31:56,680
Oh.

6966
04:31:57,340 --> 04:31:58,100
Wait, he's here.

6967
04:32:00,800 --> 04:32:01,820
That's a whole team.

6968
04:32:05,940 --> 04:32:07,140
Wait, that's a different team.

6969
04:32:07,520 --> 04:32:08,380
Wait a minute.

6970
04:32:08,380 --> 04:32:10,060
This is... do we have... okay.

6971
04:32:10,600 --> 04:32:12,140
I'm gonna do something extreme.

6972
04:32:13,340 --> 04:32:13,840
Um...

6973
04:32:16,300 --> 04:32:16,800
Guys.

6974
04:32:16,940 --> 04:32:17,580
Okay, guys.

6975
04:32:17,800 --> 04:32:19,020
Guys, I'm leaving.

6976
04:32:19,680 --> 04:32:20,180
Goodbye.

6977
04:32:22,440 --> 04:32:24,240
Guys, I'm...

6978
04:32:24,240 --> 04:32:24,560
Goodbye!

6979
04:32:27,560 --> 04:32:29,340
Guys, take the zip!

6980
04:32:31,060 --> 04:32:32,260
It's the only way!

6981
04:32:33,440 --> 04:32:34,220
I swear.

6982
04:32:34,260 --> 04:32:34,980
It's the only way.

6983
04:32:35,020 --> 04:32:35,880
You have to take the zip.

6984
04:32:37,860 --> 04:32:38,360
It's the only way.

6985
04:32:38,360 --> 04:32:38,360
You have to take the zip.

6986
04:32:38,380 --> 04:32:39,060
It's the only way.

6987
04:32:39,560 --> 04:32:40,560
Just don't die.

6988
04:32:41,920 --> 04:32:42,760
Okay, we leave.

6989
04:32:43,300 --> 04:32:44,180
Come over here!

6990
04:32:45,100 --> 04:32:45,940
Dude, leave!

6991
04:32:46,080 --> 04:32:47,120
There's so many people!

6992
04:32:47,240 --> 04:32:47,680
Come on!

6993
04:32:50,300 --> 04:32:51,980
Guys, we have to go!

6994
04:32:53,640 --> 04:32:55,700
We have to go to the zone!

6995
04:32:55,780 --> 04:32:57,320
I can't babysit you forever!

6996
04:32:58,520 --> 04:33:00,140
Okay, there's people to my left.

6997
04:33:00,220 --> 04:33:02,460
Okay, we're gonna... oh, there's people behind me.

6998
04:33:02,540 --> 04:33:03,640
Guys, we just leave.

6999
04:33:03,860 --> 04:33:05,420
Just head to the fucking zone.

7000
04:33:05,540 --> 04:33:05,940
Who cares?

7001
04:33:06,980 --> 04:33:07,940
Who cares?

7002
04:33:09,400 --> 04:33:10,960
We just need to go to the zone.

7003
04:33:11,920 --> 04:33:12,720
Just run.

7004
04:33:13,040 --> 04:33:14,040
That's all I care.

7005
04:33:16,760 --> 04:33:17,300
It's okay.

7006
04:33:17,380 --> 04:33:17,820
We're fine.

7007
04:33:18,420 --> 04:33:19,460
We're so healthy.

7008
04:33:23,060 --> 04:33:23,960
Wait, there's a package.

7009
04:33:27,040 --> 04:33:27,960
No, that's my crow.

7010
04:33:28,120 --> 04:33:28,600
Never mind.

7011
04:33:28,820 --> 04:33:30,320
Okay, we take the zip, guys!

7012
04:33:31,020 --> 04:33:31,420
Guys!

7013
04:33:33,200 --> 04:33:34,220
We take a zip!

7014
04:33:34,760 --> 04:33:35,820
And then we leave!

7015
04:33:36,340 --> 04:33:36,740
Again!

7016
04:33:38,380 --> 04:33:39,800
There's nobody near me because I scanned a crow.

7017
04:33:42,340 --> 04:33:43,240
We go here!

7018
04:33:43,840 --> 04:33:45,760
There should be nobody there, right?

7019
04:33:48,840 --> 04:33:49,280
Alright.

7020
04:33:51,100 --> 04:33:53,880
Guys, I'm so fucking hopeful for us.

7021
04:33:57,920 --> 04:33:58,360
Whoa!

7022
04:34:00,520 --> 04:34:02,320
Okay, I'm so fucking hopeful.

7023
04:34:02,440 --> 04:34:02,800
What the fuck?

7024
04:34:02,900 --> 04:34:03,000
No!

7025
04:34:03,120 --> 04:34:03,620
My package!

7026
04:34:04,220 --> 04:34:04,660
Fuck!

7027
04:34:04,720 --> 04:34:05,340
Okay, my package.

7028
04:34:05,360 --> 04:34:06,260
Okay, we're in center zone.

7029
04:34:10,080 --> 04:34:11,080
We're center zone.

7030
04:34:11,220 --> 04:34:12,320
There's nothing that could go wrong.

7031
04:34:12,680 --> 04:34:15,160
Except for these guys who might get like...

7032
04:34:15,700 --> 04:34:16,780
Kraber or some shit.

7033
04:34:16,980 --> 04:34:18,580
So I don't... I'm actually a little scared.

7034
04:34:18,800 --> 04:34:19,660
We might get Krabered.

7035
04:34:20,900 --> 04:34:21,380
Alright.

7036
04:34:21,640 --> 04:34:22,340
It's okay!

7037
04:34:22,960 --> 04:34:24,000
We're top 10!

7038
04:34:24,460 --> 04:34:26,240
That's so good for us.

7039
04:34:29,220 --> 04:34:29,940
It's okay!

7040
04:34:33,590 --> 04:34:34,530
Wait a minute.

7041
04:34:34,930 --> 04:34:36,030
I hear something.

7042
04:34:37,390 --> 04:34:38,310
Wait a minute.

7043
04:34:38,350 --> 04:34:38,930
I gotta make sure.

7044
04:34:39,370 --> 04:34:42,090
I gotta make sure there's nobody behind me.

7045
04:34:42,190 --> 04:34:43,030
I gotta make sure there's nobody behind me.

7046
04:34:43,030 --> 04:34:43,030
Please.

7047
04:34:43,450 --> 04:34:44,110
They're fighting!

7048
04:34:44,210 --> 04:34:44,950
They're fighting over here!

7049
04:34:45,050 --> 04:34:45,970
Does anyone have a sniper?

7050
04:34:49,490 --> 04:34:51,510
I can barely see what's going on!

7051
04:34:53,390 --> 04:34:54,350
Alright, it's fine.

7052
04:34:57,070 --> 04:34:59,410
I wanna thirst this guy, but he's so fucking far.

7053
04:35:00,850 --> 04:35:01,690
God damn it.

7054
04:35:01,750 --> 04:35:03,170
I'm so close to thirsting him.

7055
04:35:04,210 --> 04:35:05,410
No, he's so close.

7056
04:35:05,570 --> 04:35:06,370
I can't hit your shot.

7057
04:35:06,450 --> 04:35:06,490
Oh.

7058
04:35:09,290 --> 04:35:09,810
You know what?

7059
04:35:09,830 --> 04:35:10,310
Good for you.

7060
04:35:11,890 --> 04:35:13,250
I'm glad you hit your shot.

7061
04:35:14,810 --> 04:35:15,910
I'm happy for you.

7062
04:35:18,670 --> 04:35:18,990
Alright.

7063
04:35:22,190 --> 04:35:22,890
Alright, we're good.

7064
04:35:24,410 --> 04:35:25,110
Okay, we're in zone.

7065
04:35:25,250 --> 04:35:25,570
We're in zone.

7066
04:35:25,610 --> 04:35:26,290
Nothing to worry about.

7067
04:35:26,410 --> 04:35:26,750
We're in zone.

7068
04:35:29,070 --> 04:35:30,230
Okay, I gotta grab that.

7069
04:35:30,350 --> 04:35:32,010
I'm gonna make sure there's nobody behind us too.

7070
04:35:32,630 --> 04:35:33,790
That's what I'm worried about.

7071
04:35:33,950 --> 04:35:35,730
I need to make sure my backs are free.

7072
04:35:36,670 --> 04:35:38,350
From anybody that wants to third us.

7073
04:35:40,030 --> 04:35:40,990
I'll take the redeploy.

7074
04:35:41,190 --> 04:35:41,990
Where's the redeploy?

7075
04:35:45,350 --> 04:35:47,010
There's people to my right.

7076
04:35:51,410 --> 04:35:52,810
Oh my god, he was flesh!

7077
04:35:54,810 --> 04:35:56,230
That guy was fucking flesh!

7078
04:35:57,490 --> 04:35:58,110
We're in zone.

7079
04:35:58,230 --> 04:35:58,530
We're in zone.

7080
04:35:58,730 --> 04:35:59,750
We don't have to worry.

7081
04:36:01,170 --> 04:36:01,730
Wait, what?

7082
04:36:03,390 --> 04:36:04,070
Wait, what?

7083
04:36:04,870 --> 04:36:07,230
Okay, let me bat real fast.

7084
04:36:09,050 --> 04:36:09,830
No, it's fine!

7085
04:36:09,910 --> 04:36:10,290
It's okay!

7086
04:36:10,370 --> 04:36:10,970
We're so healthy!

7087
04:36:12,530 --> 04:36:13,890
We're so healthy right now.

7088
04:36:14,270 --> 04:36:14,890
It's fine.

7089
04:36:15,790 --> 04:36:17,030
Nothing to worry about.

7090
04:36:18,170 --> 04:36:18,990
I need energy.

7091
04:36:19,150 --> 04:36:19,950
Do you guys have energy?

7092
04:36:22,190 --> 04:36:23,190
Do you guys have energy?

7093
04:36:27,410 --> 04:36:29,090
Oh my god we're all running with energy.

7094
04:36:29,390 --> 04:36:30,610
Why are we all running energy?

7095
04:36:34,870 --> 04:36:36,790
Guys that was not very smart of us.

7096
04:36:36,890 --> 04:36:37,290
Wait, what?

7097
04:36:37,530 --> 04:36:37,930
Where?

7098
04:36:37,930 --> 04:36:38,050
There.

7099
04:36:40,130 --> 04:36:40,890
Too hostile.

7100
04:36:41,030 --> 04:36:42,310
Above, above, above, above, above, above!

7101
04:36:42,850 --> 04:36:43,830
Above us, above us!

7102
04:36:45,630 --> 04:36:46,430
Above us.

7103
04:36:49,490 --> 04:36:50,490
We got a wall.

7104
04:36:52,170 --> 04:36:54,110
Okay, they're right above us.

7105
04:36:55,250 --> 04:36:55,830
Put walls!

7106
04:36:56,410 --> 04:36:56,850
Cameron!

7107
04:36:57,250 --> 04:36:59,370
Use your master skills and put up walls!

7108
04:37:08,330 --> 04:37:08,990
Wait, what?

7109
04:37:12,210 --> 04:37:12,650
What?

7110
04:37:15,230 --> 04:37:17,350
Wait, did they put up the redeploy?

7111
04:37:17,570 --> 04:37:18,350
Oh, we're not there.

7112
04:37:19,090 --> 04:37:20,610
Guys, we can steal their redeploy.

7113
04:37:22,370 --> 04:37:22,730
Guys!

7114
04:37:23,090 --> 04:37:24,230
We steal their redeploy!

7115
04:37:25,110 --> 04:37:25,470
Guys!

7116
04:37:27,470 --> 04:37:28,370
Come, come, come, come, come!

7117
04:37:29,870 --> 04:37:31,030
We steal their redeploy!

7118
04:37:32,130 --> 04:37:32,910
It's ours now!

7119
04:37:34,790 --> 04:37:35,150
Umm...

7120
04:37:35,150 --> 04:37:37,730
We have to go this way.

7121
04:37:38,890 --> 04:37:39,810
Guys, guys, guys!

7122
04:37:39,910 --> 04:37:40,710
Come here, come here, come here!

7123
04:37:42,170 --> 04:37:42,670
Come here!

7124
04:37:45,930 --> 04:37:47,230
We go in the tunnel!

7125
04:37:51,130 --> 04:37:52,070
Fight this, fight this!

7126
04:37:58,440 --> 04:38:00,700
Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're so f**ing fine.

7127
04:38:00,920 --> 04:38:01,820
We're so healthy.

7128
04:38:02,900 --> 04:38:04,000
We're so healthy.

7129
04:38:06,900 --> 04:38:08,260
Wait, did they win this already?

7130
04:38:09,580 --> 04:38:10,640
No, I don't have nades.

7131
04:38:10,900 --> 04:38:12,060
I don't have nades.

7132
04:38:12,100 --> 04:38:12,840
I can't do anything.

7133
04:38:14,680 --> 04:38:16,460
I can't do anything about it.

7134
04:38:16,740 --> 04:38:19,500
And this time there's no nades!

7135
04:38:19,500 --> 04:38:20,500
I can't do anything about it!

7136
04:38:20,560 --> 04:38:21,340
I don't have nades!

7137
04:38:22,100 --> 04:38:22,820
Break the door!

7138
04:38:22,820 --> 04:38:23,840
Break the door with your Rampart Art!

7139
04:38:24,140 --> 04:38:25,480
Break the door with your Rampart Art!

7140
04:38:25,780 --> 04:38:26,460
Trust me!

7141
04:38:26,500 --> 04:38:26,780
Trust me!

7142
04:38:27,420 --> 04:38:28,500
You have Rampart Art!

7143
04:38:29,100 --> 04:38:29,640
Break it!

7144
04:38:29,680 --> 04:38:29,960
Break it!

7145
04:38:32,360 --> 04:38:32,900
It's okay.

7146
04:38:32,980 --> 04:38:33,720
Never mind then.

7147
04:38:39,260 --> 04:38:39,880
Alright, nice.

7148
04:38:40,080 --> 04:38:41,540
I can't see jack shit, but okay.

7149
04:38:43,520 --> 04:38:44,640
I'm gonna heal now.

7150
04:38:44,880 --> 04:38:45,960
I can't see anything.

7151
04:38:47,480 --> 04:38:47,880
Alright!

7152
04:38:48,400 --> 04:38:49,960
We're getting ulted.

7153
04:38:49,960 --> 04:38:51,380
Guys, come back to me!

7154
04:38:51,480 --> 04:38:52,080
Come back to me!

7155
04:38:52,140 --> 04:38:53,580
Guys, I don't wanna do this anymore!

7156
04:38:53,860 --> 04:38:55,000
We go in the tunnel.

7157
04:38:55,080 --> 04:38:55,600
Trust me!

7158
04:38:55,960 --> 04:38:57,080
We go in the tunnel!

7159
04:38:57,840 --> 04:38:58,220
Trust!

7160
04:39:00,480 --> 04:39:00,860
Trust!

7161
04:39:01,540 --> 04:39:02,220
Come back!

7162
04:39:02,300 --> 04:39:03,060
Come back, Wraith!

7163
04:39:03,920 --> 04:39:04,900
Don't be a hero!

7164
04:39:05,260 --> 04:39:06,080
I'm gonna thirst him though.

7165
04:39:06,520 --> 04:39:07,220
Wraith, no!

7166
04:39:09,600 --> 04:39:10,880
Don't be a hero!

7167
04:39:11,760 --> 04:39:12,500
Okay, he's fucked.

7168
04:39:12,540 --> 04:39:13,200
We can't save him.

7169
04:39:13,520 --> 04:39:14,400
Like, there's no way.

7170
04:39:14,540 --> 04:39:15,980
There's no way we can save this man.

7171
04:39:18,700 --> 04:39:19,540
There's no way.

7172
04:39:20,820 --> 04:39:21,500
I'm gonna Q.

7173
04:39:21,600 --> 04:39:23,040
I'm gonna give you a Q in three seconds.

7174
04:39:26,120 --> 04:39:27,720
There is... on the roof?

7175
04:39:28,540 --> 04:39:29,800
We can kill him on the roof actually.

7176
04:39:31,380 --> 04:39:32,200
Yeah, knock one guy.

7177
04:39:32,360 --> 04:39:32,620
Yeah.

7178
04:39:33,280 --> 04:39:33,600
Nice.

7179
04:39:37,720 --> 04:39:38,180
Oh, dead!

7180
04:39:38,240 --> 04:39:38,520
Dead, dead, dead!

7181
04:39:38,600 --> 04:39:38,880
Full dead!

7182
04:39:38,980 --> 04:39:39,880
Full dead!

7183
04:39:40,000 --> 04:39:40,180
Full dead!

7184
04:39:40,340 --> 04:39:40,820
I picked him up!

7185
04:39:40,880 --> 04:39:41,220
Go rez!

7186
04:39:41,260 --> 04:39:41,720
Go rez him!

7187
04:39:43,120 --> 04:39:43,700
They're all dead!

7188
04:39:43,780 --> 04:39:44,140
They're all dead!

7189
04:39:44,180 --> 04:39:44,420
Go rez!

7190
04:39:44,440 --> 04:39:45,160
Go rez him!

7191
04:39:45,160 --> 04:39:45,300
They're all dead!

7192
04:39:45,300 --> 04:39:45,300
They're all dead!

7193
04:39:45,300 --> 04:39:46,260
We have rez!

7194
04:39:49,360 --> 04:39:50,360
Go be a hero!

7195
04:39:50,480 --> 04:39:51,060
Rez this man!

7196
04:39:52,140 --> 04:39:53,000
Which I'll take then.

7197
04:39:53,920 --> 04:39:54,860
I'll take this actually.

7198
04:39:55,780 --> 04:39:57,000
Okay, don't be a hero maybe.

7199
04:39:58,080 --> 04:39:59,100
Maybe don't be a hero.

7200
04:39:59,800 --> 04:40:01,500
I only have five energy ammo.

7201
04:40:01,600 --> 04:40:01,920
Oh, wait.

7202
04:40:02,640 --> 04:40:02,960
Nice.

7203
04:40:04,800 --> 04:40:05,580
Are you rezzing him?

7204
04:40:07,220 --> 04:40:07,800
Oh, shit.

7205
04:40:07,820 --> 04:40:08,800
Yeah, do not rez him yet.

7206
04:40:08,840 --> 04:40:09,440
There's people here.

7207
04:40:10,820 --> 04:40:11,340
You're free!

7208
04:40:11,400 --> 04:40:11,900
You're free to rez!

7209
04:40:11,940 --> 04:40:12,320

7210
04:40:12,620 --> 04:40:13,120
Trust me!

7211
04:40:13,160 --> 04:40:13,740
No one will know!

7212
04:40:13,820 --> 04:40:14,340
No one will know!

7213
04:40:14,680 --> 04:40:15,640
Cameron, be a hero!

7214
04:40:15,720 --> 04:40:16,320
No one will know!

7215
04:40:16,380 --> 04:40:16,740
Trust me!

7216
04:40:19,360 --> 04:40:20,360
Cameron, trust me!

7217
04:40:20,400 --> 04:40:20,920
Cameron, trust me!

7218
04:40:20,920 --> 04:40:21,160
Trust me!

7219
04:40:21,240 --> 04:40:21,840
No one will know!

7220
04:40:22,040 --> 04:40:23,960
I swear to god, no one will know!

7221
04:40:29,410 --> 04:40:30,590
See, I told you!

7222
04:40:30,850 --> 04:40:32,050
They didn't know!

7223
04:40:33,810 --> 04:40:34,710
I'm leaving.

7224
04:40:35,130 --> 04:40:35,990
Holy shit.

7225
04:40:36,530 --> 04:40:37,650
I told you!

7226
04:40:38,410 --> 04:40:39,530
No one knew!

7227
04:40:44,450 --> 04:40:46,290
You needed to trust me!

7228
04:40:47,830 --> 04:40:49,550
I told you no one will know!

7229
04:40:50,510 --> 04:40:51,750
Go grab the fucking...

7230
04:40:55,620 --> 04:40:56,280
He's flash.

7231
04:40:56,360 --> 04:40:56,600
He's flash.

7232
04:40:58,280 --> 04:41:00,260
I told you guys no one will know.

7233
04:41:01,020 --> 04:41:02,180
Like, it was so easy.

7234
04:41:03,260 --> 04:41:03,740
Nice.

7235
04:41:04,080 --> 04:41:04,820
I'm gonna bat.

7236
04:41:05,620 --> 04:41:06,380
Oh no.

7237
04:41:06,520 --> 04:41:08,740
Okay, we don't have any rez beacons here, guys.

7238
04:41:10,940 --> 04:41:11,760
Oh no.

7239
04:41:12,500 --> 04:41:13,640
No one will know.

7240
04:41:18,650 --> 04:41:19,130
Okay.

7241
04:41:19,950 --> 04:41:20,630
Let's see.

7242
04:41:27,720 --> 04:41:28,200
SIDE!

7243
04:41:28,440 --> 04:41:29,560
I got there!

7244
04:41:29,600 --> 04:41:30,680
I did it so hard!

7245
04:41:31,520 --> 04:41:32,200
No!

7246
04:41:32,480 --> 04:41:33,400
That's right, bitch!

7247
04:41:33,440 --> 04:41:34,240
You deserve it!

7248
04:41:34,320 --> 04:41:34,880
Get thirsty!

7249
04:41:36,720 --> 04:41:38,900
I got shot in the side!

7250
04:41:40,660 --> 04:41:41,340
No!

7251
04:41:42,160 --> 04:41:43,760
I did so much!

7252
04:41:46,100 --> 04:41:47,680
What happened, Cameron?

7253
04:41:49,280 --> 04:41:52,000
Did you not plug in your controller?

7254
04:41:53,600 --> 04:41:55,660
I analyzed you!

7255
04:41:56,780 --> 04:41:57,460
Cameron!

7256
04:41:57,660 --> 04:41:58,040
Cameron!

7257
04:41:59,660 --> 04:42:00,340
GG!

7258
04:42:02,780 --> 04:42:03,460
Cameron!

7259
04:42:03,860 --> 04:42:06,320
I analyzed you, Cameron!

7260
04:42:14,840 --> 04:42:18,360
Cameron, give me your excuse right now what happened.

7261
04:42:18,500 --> 04:42:19,580
I need to know.

7262
04:42:19,740 --> 04:42:20,280
Cameron.

7263
04:42:21,720 --> 04:42:22,720
Tape and chat.

7264
04:42:22,880 --> 04:42:24,720
What is your excuse in chat?

7265
04:42:25,120 --> 04:42:26,680
No stream delay.

7266
04:42:26,680 --> 04:42:29,740
Yeah, let me put a stream delay on this.

7267
04:42:30,000 --> 04:42:32,600
No stream delay.

7268
04:42:32,600 --> 04:42:33,600
You confused me.

7269
04:42:34,640 --> 04:42:36,240
I got sniped!

7270
04:42:37,560 --> 04:42:38,260
I got sniped!

7271
04:42:39,500 --> 04:42:42,880
I got sniped!

7272
04:42:44,480 --> 04:42:46,120
Someone please kill this man.

7273
04:42:46,180 --> 04:42:46,940
He's literally solo.

7274
04:42:47,260 --> 04:42:48,360
He's literally solo!

7275
04:42:48,800 --> 04:42:49,860
Run at him!

7276
04:42:50,180 --> 04:42:51,300
He has nothing!

7277
04:42:52,800 --> 04:42:55,000
Just beat him up with your fist!

7278
04:42:55,000 --> 04:42:55,960
He's solo!

7279
04:42:57,820 --> 04:42:58,760
Oh my god!

7280
04:42:58,780 --> 04:42:59,280
Punch him!

7281
04:43:04,760 --> 04:43:06,060
Cameron for goal.

7282
04:43:06,280 --> 04:43:07,000
He for goal.

7283
04:43:12,700 --> 04:43:13,380
GG's.

7284
04:43:13,380 --> 04:43:14,320
GG's guys.

7285
04:43:16,320 --> 04:43:17,000
GG's.

7286
04:43:20,740 --> 04:43:21,760
GG's everybody.

7287
04:43:23,100 --> 04:43:25,560
Alright, we will do one more game.

7288
04:43:25,620 --> 04:43:26,640
We will do one last game.

7289
04:43:27,060 --> 04:43:28,720
But like this time.

7290
04:43:29,160 --> 04:43:31,680
This time it will be melee only.

7291
04:43:32,560 --> 04:43:36,820
You cannot use any damaging abilities.

7292
04:43:37,480 --> 04:43:40,800
Guys, okay I'm gonna leave custom match.

7293
04:43:41,080 --> 04:43:44,820
And then I'm gonna create private match.

7294
04:43:45,360 --> 04:43:45,920
Create.

7295
04:43:46,920 --> 04:43:47,900
It's the same.

7296
04:43:48,180 --> 04:43:49,420
Is this the same code?

7297
04:43:49,620 --> 04:43:49,860
Okay.

7298
04:43:50,020 --> 04:43:50,560
Alright.

7299
04:43:53,360 --> 04:43:53,920
Okay.

7300
04:43:53,920 --> 04:43:55,960
No damaging abilities.

7301
04:43:56,740 --> 04:43:57,540
Guys.

7302
04:43:58,760 --> 04:44:01,000
No damaging abilities.

7303
04:44:05,620 --> 04:44:06,920
Melee only.

7304
04:44:11,160 --> 04:44:13,220
No damaging abilities.

7305
04:44:13,880 --> 04:44:15,880
And you can punch people.

7306
04:44:16,080 --> 04:44:18,460
This calls for Olympus.

7307
04:44:18,520 --> 04:44:19,320
Because I want the car.

7308
04:44:19,620 --> 04:44:21,000
I want the car.

7309
04:44:23,060 --> 04:44:23,860
Alright.

7310
04:44:25,000 --> 04:44:26,100
I don't have to analyze anybody here.

7311
04:44:26,860 --> 04:44:29,360
I don't have to analyze anyone.

7312
04:44:32,520 --> 04:44:33,380
Alright.

7313
04:44:34,900 --> 04:44:35,330
Okay.

7314
04:44:36,020 --> 04:44:37,700
No damaging abilities.

7315
04:44:38,120 --> 04:44:38,940
Melee only.

7316
04:44:39,360 --> 04:44:40,880
Melee only.

7317
04:44:41,060 --> 04:44:41,780
Chat.

7318
04:44:42,060 --> 04:44:42,840
Okay?

7319
04:44:43,480 --> 04:44:44,980
Melee only.

7320
04:44:45,000 --> 04:44:47,060
Melee only.

7321
04:44:47,580 --> 04:44:51,240
Let me put you guys into teams real quick.

7322
04:44:52,600 --> 04:44:53,460
Boop.

7323
04:44:54,000 --> 04:44:54,860
Boop.

7324
04:44:55,320 --> 04:44:56,740
And then boop.

7325
04:44:57,800 --> 04:44:58,240
And...

7326
04:44:59,540 --> 04:45:00,760
I'll put you guys in observers.

7327
04:45:01,740 --> 04:45:02,180
Alright.

7328
04:45:02,600 --> 04:45:03,040
Remember.

7329
04:45:04,220 --> 04:45:05,160
Melee only.

7330
04:45:06,920 --> 04:45:08,400
No damaging abilities.

7331
04:45:08,480 --> 04:45:09,080
No damaging abilities.

7332
04:45:09,240 --> 04:45:09,660
Okay?

7333
04:45:10,180 --> 04:45:11,060
We gotta get a car.

7334
04:45:11,460 --> 04:45:12,580
Guys, we gotta get a car.

7335
04:45:12,740 --> 04:45:14,080
We gotta get a car.

7336
04:45:18,460 --> 04:45:19,960
Guys, we have to get a car.

7337
04:45:20,100 --> 04:45:21,140
We can't let them...

7338
04:45:21,620 --> 04:45:23,280
We gotta get a car, guys.

7339
04:45:23,500 --> 04:45:23,660
We gotta get a car, guys.

7340
04:45:23,680 --> 04:45:24,120
Team.

7341
04:45:25,000 --> 04:45:26,240
We gotta get a car, team.

7342
04:45:28,160 --> 04:45:28,680
No.

7343
04:45:28,840 --> 04:45:29,740
Yes, cars.

7344
04:45:31,120 --> 04:45:31,960
Yes, cars.

7345
04:45:32,360 --> 04:45:34,060
Guys, I'm literally the host.

7346
04:45:34,260 --> 04:45:35,360
You can't say no cars.

7347
04:45:35,540 --> 04:45:37,140
I'm literally the host right now.

7348
04:45:37,720 --> 04:45:38,240
Chat.

7349
04:45:38,480 --> 04:45:39,780
You can't say that to me.

7350
04:45:41,360 --> 04:45:42,760
You can't say that.

7351
04:45:48,560 --> 04:45:50,400
I'm literally the host.

7352
04:45:55,020 --> 04:45:55,540
Okay.

7353
04:46:00,500 --> 04:46:01,020
1v3?

7354
04:46:01,080 --> 04:46:01,300
No.

7355
04:46:01,540 --> 04:46:02,060
Guys.

7356
04:46:02,220 --> 04:46:02,480
No.

7357
04:46:02,660 --> 04:46:02,960
Okay.

7358
04:46:04,300 --> 04:46:04,820
Fuck.

7359
04:46:05,400 --> 04:46:08,120
What would be a good no damaging ability?

7360
04:46:09,060 --> 04:46:10,540
What would be a good one?

7361
04:46:10,760 --> 04:46:11,280
Octane!

7362
04:46:11,380 --> 04:46:12,180
I can self heal.

7363
04:46:13,960 --> 04:46:14,480
Wait.

7364
04:46:14,600 --> 04:46:14,860
Okay.

7365
04:46:14,980 --> 04:46:15,400
Guys.

7366
04:46:15,540 --> 04:46:15,920
Yes.

7367
04:46:16,060 --> 04:46:16,440
Yes.

7368
04:46:16,700 --> 04:46:17,220
Newcastle.

7369
04:46:17,240 --> 04:46:17,960
That's a good idea.

7370
04:46:18,480 --> 04:46:19,820
Just keep rezzing me.

7371
04:46:20,560 --> 04:46:21,700
We can't die.

7372
04:46:21,920 --> 04:46:22,880
We can't.

7373
04:46:22,880 --> 04:46:24,680
We can't die.

7374
04:46:24,680 --> 04:46:27,140
If you both keep rezzing me.

7375
04:46:29,400 --> 04:46:30,360
Oh my god!

7376
04:46:30,400 --> 04:46:31,440
We should have played Horizon!

7377
04:46:34,220 --> 04:46:34,700
Guys.

7378
04:46:35,240 --> 04:46:35,720
Just.

7379
04:46:37,100 --> 04:46:37,960
Do not.

7380
04:46:38,020 --> 04:46:40,080
Just keep rezzing me and then we can win this.

7381
04:46:40,660 --> 04:46:41,140
Alright?

7382
04:46:41,440 --> 04:46:42,500
We gotta think this.

7383
04:46:42,660 --> 04:46:43,220
We gotta.

7384
04:46:43,280 --> 04:46:47,200
We gotta be able to think this strategically.

7385
04:46:47,560 --> 04:46:47,980
Okay.

7386
04:46:48,140 --> 04:46:48,580
Okay.

7387
04:46:48,600 --> 04:46:48,920
Where's.

7388
04:46:49,100 --> 04:46:49,580
Guys.

7389
04:46:49,700 --> 04:46:50,380
The car.

7390
04:46:50,980 --> 04:46:51,460
Guys.

7391
04:46:51,500 --> 04:46:52,020
Right here.

7392
04:46:52,380 --> 04:46:53,140
The car.

7393
04:46:56,320 --> 04:46:57,980
We gotta get that car.

7394
04:46:58,280 --> 04:46:58,920
We gotta get that car.

7395
04:46:59,440 --> 04:46:59,960
Guys.

7396
04:47:00,100 --> 04:47:03,240
Our only mission right now is to grab the car.

7397
04:47:07,880 --> 04:47:09,040
That's all we need!

7398
04:47:09,380 --> 04:47:10,500
We need the car!

7399
04:47:13,380 --> 04:47:13,900
Alright.

7400
04:47:16,340 --> 04:47:17,100
Where's the car?

7401
04:47:17,700 --> 04:47:18,080
Oh.

7402
04:47:18,100 --> 04:47:18,280
Here.

7403
04:47:18,500 --> 04:47:21,220
I fucking couldn't find the car for some reason.

7404
04:47:21,460 --> 04:47:21,780
Alright.

7405
04:47:21,840 --> 04:47:22,120
We go.

7406
04:47:22,460 --> 04:47:23,120
We go.

7407
04:47:23,200 --> 04:47:23,860
Grab the car.

7408
04:47:24,680 --> 04:47:25,300
Get over here!

7409
04:47:26,960 --> 04:47:27,920
Oh my god.

7410
04:47:27,940 --> 04:47:28,420
What the fuck.

7411
04:47:28,440 --> 04:47:29,220
I like stalled for.

7412
04:47:29,300 --> 04:47:29,980
Oh my god.

7413
04:47:30,000 --> 04:47:31,480
Did I got like grift or something?

7414
04:47:31,980 --> 04:47:32,380
Guys.

7415
04:47:32,440 --> 04:47:32,720
Okay.

7416
04:47:32,780 --> 04:47:34,520
I forgot we could have played Pathfinder 2.

7417
04:47:35,000 --> 04:47:35,600
It's okay.

7418
04:47:35,660 --> 04:47:36,000
We're good.

7419
04:47:36,580 --> 04:47:36,980
Nice.

7420
04:47:37,180 --> 04:47:37,480
Alright.

7421
04:47:37,540 --> 04:47:38,080
We got everything.

7422
04:47:38,280 --> 04:47:39,800
Now I don't know what the plan is anymore.

7423
04:47:40,260 --> 04:47:40,660
Alright.

7424
04:47:43,440 --> 04:47:43,840
Guys.

7425
04:47:44,180 --> 04:47:46,240
That was the extent of my plan.

7426
04:47:46,940 --> 04:47:47,620
Now I don't.

7427
04:47:47,640 --> 04:47:48,780
I guess we loot for heals.

7428
04:47:48,940 --> 04:47:49,300
Wait.

7429
04:47:49,320 --> 04:47:50,240
They have cars too!

7430
04:47:51,360 --> 04:47:51,760
What?

7431
04:47:52,700 --> 04:47:53,100
Alright.

7432
04:47:53,320 --> 04:47:53,440
Guys.

7433
04:47:53,640 --> 04:47:54,340
Go loot heals.

7434
04:47:55,080 --> 04:47:55,480
Guys.

7435
04:47:55,560 --> 04:47:56,720
Go loot some heals right now.

7436
04:47:58,080 --> 04:47:58,700
Loot heals.

7437
04:47:59,000 --> 04:47:59,780
We need heals.

7438
04:48:01,040 --> 04:48:01,440
Guys.

7439
04:48:01,520 --> 04:48:02,300
Go do your thing.

7440
04:48:03,760 --> 04:48:04,800
There's no plan B.

7441
04:48:05,140 --> 04:48:05,960
There's another car.

7442
04:48:06,080 --> 04:48:06,260
Okay.

7443
04:48:06,300 --> 04:48:07,600
I'm gonna take you guys to the second car.

7444
04:48:08,120 --> 04:48:08,520
Alright.

7445
04:48:08,600 --> 04:48:10,160
I'm gonna take you guys to the second car.

7446
04:48:11,180 --> 04:48:11,580
Alright.

7447
04:48:11,600 --> 04:48:14,040
One guy loot heals here and then we'll pick you up later.

7448
04:48:16,060 --> 04:48:16,460
Alright.

7449
04:48:19,120 --> 04:48:19,320
Alright.

7450
04:48:19,440 --> 04:48:19,620
Alright.

7451
04:48:19,740 --> 04:48:19,800
Alright.

7452
04:48:19,800 --> 04:48:19,880
Alright.

7453
04:48:20,060 --> 04:48:20,460
Newcastle.

7454
04:48:20,480 --> 04:48:20,760
Come here.

7455
04:48:21,060 --> 04:48:21,740
Plan B.

7456
04:48:21,760 --> 04:48:23,160
Get another car.

7457
04:48:23,560 --> 04:48:23,960
Wait.

7458
04:48:24,080 --> 04:48:24,600
Loot this.

7459
04:48:24,800 --> 04:48:25,400
Loot this.

7460
04:48:25,660 --> 04:48:26,060
Lifeline.

7461
04:48:26,200 --> 04:48:27,060
Click this right now.

7462
04:48:28,560 --> 04:48:28,960
Lifeline.

7463
04:48:28,960 --> 04:48:30,000
Lifeline is right here.

7464
04:48:31,420 --> 04:48:31,820
Lifeline.

7465
04:48:34,220 --> 04:48:34,960
Click this.

7466
04:48:35,500 --> 04:48:35,900
Yeah.

7467
04:48:36,740 --> 04:48:37,460
Oh shit.

7468
04:48:37,500 --> 04:48:37,940
We gotta go.

7469
04:48:38,180 --> 04:48:39,040
We gotta go.

7470
04:48:39,220 --> 04:48:40,440
We gotta go.

7471
04:48:41,000 --> 04:48:42,320
We gotta get the second car.

7472
04:48:42,420 --> 04:48:43,860
Who got the second car?

7473
04:48:44,740 --> 04:48:46,000
We gotta get the third car.

7474
04:48:46,140 --> 04:48:47,240
It's all the way over there.

7475
04:48:47,320 --> 04:48:47,840
But it's okay.

7476
04:48:47,900 --> 04:48:48,540
We can do this.

7477
04:48:49,140 --> 04:48:50,100
We can make it.

7478
04:48:51,760 --> 04:48:52,280
We can grab...

7479
04:48:53,280 --> 04:48:55,700
We can grab the third car.

7480
04:48:56,140 --> 04:48:57,200
It's possible.

7481
04:48:58,180 --> 04:48:58,740
Okay.

7482
04:48:58,800 --> 04:49:00,540
How do we intercept you?

7483
04:49:00,560 --> 04:49:00,680
Okay.

7484
04:49:00,720 --> 04:49:01,520
We gotta go from here.

7485
04:49:01,740 --> 04:49:02,300
Okay.

7486
04:49:02,760 --> 04:49:04,780
We gotta grab that third car.

7487
04:49:05,060 --> 04:49:05,520
It's okay.

7488
04:49:05,620 --> 04:49:07,380
A little zone damage wouldn't hurt anybody.

7489
04:49:08,280 --> 04:49:09,140
We'll be fine.

7490
04:49:09,300 --> 04:49:11,680
Plan B.

7491
04:49:11,680 --> 04:49:11,960
Plan B.

7492
04:49:13,380 --> 04:49:14,580
Step number two.

7493
04:49:14,740 --> 04:49:15,280
Two cars.

7494
04:49:15,560 --> 04:49:17,260
Step number... Who grabbed this car?

7495
04:49:17,520 --> 04:49:19,020
Who keeps grabbing the cars?

7496
04:49:20,720 --> 04:49:21,080
Wait.

7497
04:49:21,080 --> 04:49:22,040
I actually got off.

7498
04:49:22,180 --> 04:49:22,500
Guys.

7499
04:49:22,580 --> 04:49:22,820
Sorry.

7500
04:49:24,940 --> 04:49:25,300
Guys.

7501
04:49:25,400 --> 04:49:25,820
Get back out.

7502
04:49:25,860 --> 04:49:26,720
It was an accident.

7503
04:49:28,680 --> 04:49:29,100
Oh wait.

7504
04:49:29,140 --> 04:49:29,520
We need that.

7505
04:49:29,660 --> 04:49:30,020
Actually.

7506
04:49:30,080 --> 04:49:30,480
Grab that.

7507
04:49:30,500 --> 04:49:31,300
Grab the yellow thing.

7508
04:49:31,780 --> 04:49:32,140
Yeah.

7509
04:49:32,160 --> 04:49:32,300
Yeah.

7510
04:49:32,360 --> 04:49:32,460
Yeah.

7511
04:49:32,680 --> 04:49:33,160
Don't worry.

7512
04:49:33,360 --> 04:49:34,400
There's still another car here.

7513
04:49:35,240 --> 04:49:35,760
Grab this.

7514
04:49:38,480 --> 04:49:38,840
Alright.

7515
04:49:40,320 --> 04:49:40,680
Newcastle.

7516
04:49:42,140 --> 04:49:42,500
Yes.

7517
04:49:42,640 --> 04:49:43,300
Blue armor.

7518
04:49:43,760 --> 04:49:44,120
Alright.

7519
04:49:44,820 --> 04:49:46,000
We gotta get that car.

7520
04:49:47,100 --> 04:49:47,460
Wait.

7521
04:49:47,480 --> 04:49:48,020
What do I need?

7522
04:49:49,520 --> 04:49:50,260
What is this?

7523
04:49:50,360 --> 04:49:51,940
Oh wait.

7524
04:49:52,020 --> 04:49:52,340
Nice.

7525
04:49:52,440 --> 04:49:52,920
Alright.

7526
04:49:54,280 --> 04:49:54,980
Number two.

7527
04:49:55,840 --> 04:49:56,580
There's still...

7528
04:49:56,580 --> 04:49:57,840
There's still that car.

7529
04:49:58,100 --> 04:49:59,220
The car is still there.

7530
04:49:59,460 --> 04:50:00,760
You can't get that car.

7531
04:50:00,840 --> 04:50:01,940
We get that car first.

7532
04:50:02,560 --> 04:50:03,040
Wait.

7533
04:50:03,060 --> 04:50:03,500
Where is it?

7534
04:50:07,100 --> 04:50:07,940
It's still there.

7535
04:50:08,240 --> 04:50:08,720
Alright.

7536
04:50:09,980 --> 04:50:10,840
Who's gonna get...

7537
04:50:10,840 --> 04:50:12,360
Who has a driver's license?

7538
04:50:13,060 --> 04:50:13,540
Guys.

7539
04:50:13,580 --> 04:50:15,020
Who has a driver's license?

7540
04:50:16,540 --> 04:50:17,020
Nice.

7541
04:50:17,060 --> 04:50:17,260
Alright.

7542
04:50:18,300 --> 04:50:18,780
Nice.

7543
04:50:19,020 --> 04:50:19,160
Alright.

7544
04:50:19,240 --> 04:50:21,460
Now we grab the yellow things.

7545
04:50:22,040 --> 04:50:23,500
There has to be another yellow.

7546
04:50:24,880 --> 04:50:25,380
Alright.

7547
04:50:25,800 --> 04:50:26,740
We grab this.

7548
04:50:26,940 --> 04:50:27,440
This.

7549
04:50:29,240 --> 04:50:29,980
Step three.

7550
04:50:30,740 --> 04:50:31,800
Boost our armor.

7551
04:50:32,640 --> 04:50:34,060
It's forklift certified.

7552
04:50:35,360 --> 04:50:35,860
Okay.

7553
04:50:35,920 --> 04:50:36,340
I'll grab it.

7554
04:50:36,360 --> 04:50:36,740
I'll grab it.

7555
04:50:39,000 --> 04:50:39,500
Okay.

7556
04:50:39,600 --> 04:50:40,080
Step three.

7557
04:50:40,100 --> 04:50:40,680
We split up.

7558
04:50:40,920 --> 04:50:44,500
We split up and grab the yellow boxes until we're...

7559
04:50:44,500 --> 04:50:45,860
Until we're red armor.

7560
04:50:45,980 --> 04:50:46,620
I go for this.

7561
04:50:47,620 --> 04:50:48,380
Oh my god.

7562
04:50:48,400 --> 04:50:50,920
This is like the most ingenious plan.

7563
04:50:51,020 --> 04:50:51,840
We're totally gonna...

7564
04:50:51,840 --> 04:50:52,120
Guys.

7565
04:50:52,200 --> 04:50:52,820
We split up.

7566
04:50:52,880 --> 04:50:53,160
Guys.

7567
04:50:53,200 --> 04:50:54,200
You don't have to follow me anymore.

7568
04:50:54,360 --> 04:50:56,920
We split up and grab until we're red armor.

7569
04:50:57,680 --> 04:50:58,120
Guys.

7570
04:50:58,200 --> 04:50:59,920
This is our ingenious plan.

7571
04:51:00,980 --> 04:51:01,800
What the f...

7572
04:51:01,800 --> 04:51:02,640
How did... What?

7573
04:51:03,120 --> 04:51:04,920
Was there a jump pad there?

7574
04:51:06,780 --> 04:51:07,220
Wait.

7575
04:51:07,280 --> 04:51:07,860
How do we get that?

7576
04:51:08,740 --> 04:51:10,600
Where the f is the yellow box here?

7577
04:51:11,060 --> 04:51:11,900
Is it underneath?

7578
04:51:12,820 --> 04:51:13,480
Oh no.

7579
04:51:13,540 --> 04:51:14,740
There's a melee guy here.

7580
04:51:15,360 --> 04:51:15,800
Waaaaaah.

7581
04:51:16,620 --> 04:51:17,040
Okay.

7582
04:51:17,220 --> 04:51:18,140
I can't be here guys.

7583
04:51:19,100 --> 04:51:20,140
Step three failed.

7584
04:51:20,380 --> 04:51:22,020
I need to find another yellow box.

7585
04:51:22,140 --> 04:51:22,380
Oh here.

7586
04:51:23,360 --> 04:51:24,040
It's okay.

7587
04:51:24,420 --> 04:51:25,740
It didn't work.

7588
04:51:26,740 --> 04:51:27,220
Look.

7589
04:51:27,360 --> 04:51:29,980
I didn't account for them not allowing cars.

7590
04:51:30,300 --> 04:51:30,680
Okay.

7591
04:51:30,880 --> 04:51:32,280
I didn't account for that.

7592
04:51:34,700 --> 04:51:36,620
Instructions were a little bit unclear there.

7593
04:51:36,780 --> 04:51:38,380
That there was like you know.

7594
04:51:38,460 --> 04:51:39,060
Another car.

7595
04:51:39,220 --> 04:51:40,000
Like another team.

7596
04:51:40,220 --> 04:51:41,480
And it doesn't allow cars.

7597
04:51:41,580 --> 04:51:42,260
I'm gonna go for that one.

7598
04:51:43,880 --> 04:51:44,360
Alright.

7599
04:51:44,600 --> 04:51:45,220
Here we go.

7600
04:51:45,360 --> 04:51:45,840
Nice.

7601
04:51:46,640 --> 04:51:48,180
We're close to purple.

7602
04:51:48,800 --> 04:51:49,640
We can do this.

7603
04:51:50,120 --> 04:51:51,920
We can get red so easy.

7604
04:51:53,160 --> 04:51:53,560
Alright.

7605
04:51:53,580 --> 04:51:54,340
We're good for that one.

7606
04:51:55,020 --> 04:51:57,260
There's no way somebody will steal my car.

7607
04:51:57,800 --> 04:51:59,060
There's no f-ing way.

7608
04:51:59,680 --> 04:52:00,640
I swear to god.

7609
04:52:00,720 --> 04:52:03,140
If someone like drops down from high ground and just yoinks my car.

7610
04:52:03,220 --> 04:52:04,320
I swear to f-ing god.

7611
04:52:07,140 --> 04:52:08,740
That would be so f-ed up.

7612
04:52:08,840 --> 04:52:09,660
I'll go grab this one.

7613
04:52:09,860 --> 04:52:10,360
Don't worry.

7614
04:52:10,380 --> 04:52:10,780

7615
04:52:12,040 --> 04:52:12,800

Cars are forever.

7619
04:52:19,820 --> 04:52:21,100
Wait I can scan this.

7620
04:52:22,100 --> 04:52:24,100

7761
04:57:10,040 --> 04:57:12,040
Look at these fucking cars.

7762
04:57:14,220 --> 04:57:15,380
So stupid.

7763
04:57:15,720 --> 04:57:18,500
What episode of Beyblade is this?

7764
04:57:19,120 --> 04:57:20,080
Let him rip!

7765
04:57:20,420 --> 04:57:20,960
Let him rip!

7766
04:57:21,280 --> 04:57:22,100
Let him rip!

7767
04:57:24,040 --> 04:57:25,780
It's like Beyblade and Sonic.

7768
04:57:26,960 --> 04:57:27,700
Come on.

7769
04:57:28,520 --> 04:57:30,000
It's literally one guy!

7770
04:57:31,240 --> 04:57:32,320
It's literally one guy!

7771
04:57:32,380 --> 04:57:32,960
You can do this!

7772
04:57:33,260 --> 04:57:34,560
You can do this team!

7773
04:57:34,920 --> 04:57:36,400
Just keep meleeing!

7774
04:57:37,060 --> 04:57:38,120
They can't run!

7775
04:57:38,280 --> 04:57:38,660
Oh my god.

7776
04:57:38,680 --> 04:57:38,840
Yes!

7777
04:57:38,840 --> 04:57:39,020
Yes!

7778
04:57:39,020 --> 04:57:39,200
Here!

7779
04:57:39,300 --> 04:57:39,660
Here!

7780
04:57:40,500 --> 04:57:41,440
This is it!

7781
04:57:41,800 --> 04:57:42,620
Keep punching!

7782
04:57:48,100 --> 04:57:49,180
It's like he's one guy.

7783
04:57:49,660 --> 04:57:50,500
There's no way.

7784
04:57:51,560 --> 04:57:53,120
There's no way he can fuck around.

7785
04:57:53,940 --> 04:57:54,720
Get over here.

7786
04:57:54,840 --> 04:57:55,880
Get your ass over here.

7787
04:57:56,280 --> 04:57:57,580
Get your ass over here.

7788
04:57:57,940 --> 04:57:58,300
Wait.

7789
04:57:58,360 --> 04:57:58,880
Melee this guy.

7790
04:57:59,600 --> 04:57:59,880
Wait.

7791
04:57:59,880 --> 04:58:00,120
Wait.

7792
04:58:00,120 --> 04:58:00,280
Wait.

7793
04:58:00,300 --> 04:58:01,100
Melee this guy.

7794
04:58:02,480 --> 04:58:02,920
Woohoo!

7795
04:58:05,260 --> 04:58:05,840
It's okay.

7796
04:58:06,020 --> 04:58:06,640
It's okay.

7797
04:58:06,840 --> 04:58:10,780
I hope you guys are fucking... I hope you guys are fucking punching.

7798
04:58:13,160 --> 04:58:14,700
We're almost to the end.

7799
04:58:16,300 --> 04:58:17,260
Who scanned?

7800
04:58:17,780 --> 04:58:19,320
Why do you need to scan?

7801
04:58:19,460 --> 04:58:20,940
We're in melee only.

7802
04:58:23,000 --> 04:58:23,660
Don't worry.

7803
04:58:23,720 --> 04:58:24,360
We're red armor.

7804
04:58:24,480 --> 04:58:26,120
None of them have red armor like us.

7805
04:58:26,620 --> 04:58:28,600
None of them are as good as us guys.

7806
04:58:28,920 --> 04:58:30,900
Look at all these cars.

7807
04:58:32,860 --> 04:58:33,520
Oh yes!

7808
04:58:33,940 --> 04:58:34,420
Yes!

7809
04:58:34,660 --> 04:58:35,240
That's it!

7810
04:58:35,840 --> 04:58:36,580
Keep punching!

7811
04:58:38,420 --> 04:58:39,200
Keep punching!

7812
04:58:43,820 --> 04:58:44,420
Yes!

7813
04:58:44,560 --> 04:58:44,920
Yes!

7814
04:58:44,920 --> 04:58:45,180
Yes!

7815
04:58:45,180 --> 04:58:45,180
Good.

7816
04:58:45,580 --> 04:58:46,840
Never stop punching!

7817
04:58:47,280 --> 04:58:48,140
Never stop!

7818
04:58:49,060 --> 04:58:50,200
Just keep going.

7819
04:58:50,360 --> 04:58:52,520
We can heal ourselves here too.

7820
04:58:53,820 --> 04:58:54,600
Are you guys punching?

7821
04:58:54,820 --> 04:58:55,720
I hope you guys are punching.

7822
04:58:56,620 --> 04:58:58,240
Why did you get off?

7823
04:58:58,700 --> 04:59:00,620
Why did you guys get off?

7824
04:59:01,120 --> 04:59:03,360
We were doing so well.

7825
04:59:03,680 --> 04:59:05,680
We were getting free heals.

7826
04:59:06,300 --> 04:59:07,820
Guys, I hope you guys are punching.

7827
04:59:07,820 --> 04:59:08,880
I hope.

7828
04:59:08,940 --> 04:59:09,560
Don't worry.

7829
04:59:09,620 --> 04:59:10,920
We're getting free heals right now.

7830
04:59:12,400 --> 04:59:13,360
No shit!

7831
04:59:13,440 --> 04:59:14,160
I can't shit!

7832
04:59:17,160 --> 04:59:18,100
Don't worry.

7833
04:59:18,820 --> 04:59:19,900
Come back in here.

7834
04:59:20,740 --> 04:59:21,440
Heal, heal.

7835
04:59:21,560 --> 04:59:22,440
You guys go heal yourself.

7836
04:59:24,340 --> 04:59:25,300
Go heal!

7837
04:59:25,800 --> 04:59:27,260
You need to shield yourself.

7838
04:59:28,640 --> 04:59:29,340
Alright, nice.

7839
04:59:31,000 --> 04:59:31,600
It's okay.

7840
04:59:31,660 --> 04:59:32,380
Everything is fine.

7841
04:59:32,920 --> 04:59:34,720
Who made a fucking hut here?

7842
04:59:36,200 --> 04:59:37,660
Okay, this is our new home.

7843
04:59:39,680 --> 04:59:40,380
Here we go.

7844
04:59:41,240 --> 04:59:42,640
Nobody can hit us here.

7845
04:59:42,840 --> 04:59:43,440
Go heal.

7846
04:59:43,680 --> 04:59:44,560
Wait, I need to heal.

7847
04:59:44,860 --> 04:59:46,460
Alright guys, I'm gonna heal real fast.

7848
04:59:46,780 --> 04:59:48,540
Stay on the ship!

7849
04:59:49,100 --> 04:59:51,300
Stay on here so nobody can steal it!

7850
04:59:53,200 --> 04:59:53,860
It's okay!

7851
04:59:54,760 --> 04:59:56,400
We can't let anybody steal it!

7852
04:59:56,740 --> 04:59:57,400
It's fine.

7853
04:59:57,460 --> 04:59:58,820
Nobody can reach the top.

7854
04:59:59,260 --> 05:00:00,760
Nobody can reach the rock.

7855
05:00:00,800 --> 05:00:01,280
We're safe.

7856
05:00:01,880 --> 05:00:02,960
We're so safe.

7857
05:00:05,500 --> 05:00:07,240
Nobody can reach it.

7858
05:00:08,500 --> 05:00:09,960
It's our base defense!

7859
05:00:10,480 --> 05:00:12,120
We're gonna surf real fast.

7860
05:00:12,440 --> 05:00:13,180
Okay, you gotta...

7861
05:00:13,180 --> 05:00:15,940
You gotta drive us closer now.

7862
05:00:16,320 --> 05:00:17,600
Alright, my turn to melee.

7863
05:00:18,240 --> 05:00:19,700
Mom said it's my turn.

7864
05:00:20,560 --> 05:00:21,120
Don't worry.

7865
05:00:21,960 --> 05:00:22,480
Don't worry.

7866
05:00:22,540 --> 05:00:23,080
We need to be on the ring.

7867
05:00:23,180 --> 05:00:24,000
We need to be in the ring!

7868
05:00:26,080 --> 05:00:27,440
We need to be in the ring, guys!

7869
05:00:28,380 --> 05:00:28,780
Guys!

7870
05:00:29,300 --> 05:00:29,700
Please.

7871
05:00:30,700 --> 05:00:32,120
We need to be in the ring.

7872
05:00:34,080 --> 05:00:35,100
Don't worry, we're almost there.

7873
05:00:36,400 --> 05:00:37,640
Alright, this is gonna be fine.

7874
05:00:37,780 --> 05:00:38,460
I feel safe.

7875
05:00:38,960 --> 05:00:40,380
I feel very safe.

7876
05:00:41,860 --> 05:00:42,260
Wait.

7877
05:00:42,940 --> 05:00:44,120
Wait, who's punching us?

7878
05:00:44,880 --> 05:00:46,580
It's okay, I feel very safe still.

7879
05:00:47,340 --> 05:00:49,480
I have zero shields, by the way, guys.

7880
05:00:49,640 --> 05:00:50,840
Wait, wait, I'm gonna craft shields.

7881
05:00:51,520 --> 05:00:52,300
I'm gonna craft shields.

7882
05:00:52,400 --> 05:00:53,440
Don't get off the car.

7883
05:00:55,360 --> 05:00:56,740
It's okay, they can't punch me.

7884
05:00:57,480 --> 05:00:58,100
We're fine.

7885
05:00:58,920 --> 05:01:00,360
Wait, who got off the car?

7886
05:01:00,400 --> 05:01:01,480
Okay, nice, nice.

7887
05:01:01,600 --> 05:01:02,160
We're fine.

7888
05:01:02,160 --> 05:01:02,540
We're fine.

7889
05:01:03,960 --> 05:01:05,480
Look at all these cars.

7890
05:01:05,780 --> 05:01:07,000
I'm gonna get off the car.

7891
05:01:07,120 --> 05:01:07,660
You guys stay in the car.

7892
05:01:07,940 --> 05:01:09,340
I'm gonna do something crazy.

7893
05:01:17,650 --> 05:01:18,470
We'll be fine.

7894
05:01:18,750 --> 05:01:19,830
This is our defense.

7895
05:01:20,410 --> 05:01:21,510
This is our defense.

7896
05:01:22,970 --> 05:01:24,490
If we can...

7897
05:01:24,490 --> 05:01:27,050
Okay, we can literally...

7898
05:01:27,770 --> 05:01:28,550
This is our defense.

7899
05:01:29,150 --> 05:01:29,630
Weee!

7900
05:01:30,890 --> 05:01:31,370
Weee!

7901
05:01:38,050 --> 05:01:41,670
You can't hurt us, we're in the air.

7902
05:01:42,970 --> 05:01:43,890
Yayyyyy.

7903
05:01:48,170 --> 05:01:49,090
Yayyyyyyy.

7904
05:01:49,650 --> 05:01:50,570
Yippee.

7905
05:01:53,670 --> 05:01:56,930
A little bouncy castle of defense.

7906
05:01:59,230 --> 05:02:00,150
YAYYYYY.

7907
05:02:06,330 --> 05:02:10,330
This is the thing... this is what devs wanted!

7908
05:02:12,730 --> 05:02:14,490
This is what devs wanted.

7909
05:02:14,750 --> 05:02:17,650
This is the true purpose of APEC Legends.

7910
05:02:18,050 --> 05:02:19,130
Right here.

7911
05:02:19,810 --> 05:02:21,130
Right here.

7912
05:02:21,130 --> 05:02:23,030
Peak APEC Gaming.

7913
05:02:24,370 --> 05:02:25,810
Peak APEC Gaming.

7914
05:02:26,050 --> 05:02:26,850
Okay, guys, guys.

7915
05:02:27,010 --> 05:02:27,890
I'm gonna get off the car.

7916
05:02:27,970 --> 05:02:29,650
Make sure the car is safe.

7917
05:02:29,730 --> 05:02:33,210
I think I have another... I think I have another... I have another ult.

7918
05:02:33,730 --> 05:02:34,470
Okay, 89.

7919
05:02:34,690 --> 05:02:34,950
Nevermind.

7920
05:02:35,090 --> 05:02:35,490
CAR!

7921
05:02:35,970 --> 05:02:36,310
Woo!

7922
05:02:37,250 --> 05:02:37,650
Shit!

7923
05:02:37,990 --> 05:02:38,990
Guys, someone else drive.

7924
05:02:39,850 --> 05:02:40,610
Someone else drive.

7925
05:02:41,490 --> 05:02:41,890
Okay.

7926
05:02:42,030 --> 05:02:43,070
I need to know my ult.

7927
05:02:43,310 --> 05:02:44,330
Okay, guys, guys.

7928
05:02:44,370 --> 05:02:44,750
Give me a sec.

7929
05:02:44,830 --> 05:02:45,310
I'm gonna...

7930
05:02:46,990 --> 05:02:49,190
I'm gonna give ourselves another one.

7931
05:02:49,650 --> 05:02:50,250
Right here.

7932
05:02:51,410 --> 05:02:52,050
There we go.

7933
05:02:52,710 --> 05:02:53,150
Safe.

7934
05:02:53,510 --> 05:02:54,650
Wait, where is my car?

7935
05:02:54,890 --> 05:02:56,290
Where is my... Yes!

7936
05:02:56,510 --> 05:02:57,510
Where is my car?

7937
05:02:58,430 --> 05:02:59,390
Dude, where is my car?

7938
05:02:59,710 --> 05:03:00,430
Okay, here we go.

7939
05:03:00,450 --> 05:03:00,910
Another safe.

7940
05:03:01,250 --> 05:03:01,690
Yay!

7941
05:03:06,370 --> 05:03:07,450
We're... we're okay.

7942
05:03:08,250 --> 05:03:10,430
We have another defense here.

7943
05:03:13,690 --> 05:03:15,430
Our turret... No, no, no, no.

7944
05:03:15,450 --> 05:03:16,490
Do not drive in the ring.

7945
05:03:16,630 --> 05:03:17,990
Do not drive in the ring.

7946
05:03:18,190 --> 05:03:18,550
No!

7947
05:03:19,450 --> 05:03:19,990
It's okay.

7948
05:03:20,050 --> 05:03:20,250
It's okay.

7949
05:03:21,130 --> 05:03:21,790
We're okay.

7950
05:03:22,990 --> 05:03:23,990
Everything is fine.

7951
05:03:24,590 --> 05:03:25,730
Everything is fine.

7952
05:03:25,790 --> 05:03:26,870
Use the bouncy castle!

7953
05:03:28,150 --> 05:03:29,170
Swap... swap drivers.

7954
05:03:29,230 --> 05:03:29,710
Swap drivers.

7955
05:03:29,910 --> 05:03:31,070
Guys, swap drivers.

7956
05:03:31,250 --> 05:03:31,970
I'm a better driver.

7957
05:03:32,930 --> 05:03:33,690
Swap drivers.

7958
05:03:35,210 --> 05:03:35,690
Okay.

7959
05:03:36,690 --> 05:03:37,490
Where's my car?

7960
05:03:37,990 --> 05:03:38,790
Where's my car?

7961
05:03:39,410 --> 05:03:41,290
Where's... where is the car?

7962
05:03:43,710 --> 05:03:44,950
Wait, this works!

7963
05:03:45,230 --> 05:03:45,690
Stay there!

7964
05:03:45,770 --> 05:03:46,130
Stay there!

7965
05:03:46,190 --> 05:03:46,670
Just stay there!

7966
05:03:46,830 --> 05:03:47,490
Just stay there!

7967
05:03:47,530 --> 05:03:48,030
You'll be safe!

7968
05:03:48,210 --> 05:03:49,150
Just stay there!

7969
05:03:49,250 --> 05:03:50,050
Do not move!

7970
05:03:50,050 --> 05:03:51,630
Do not move!

7971
05:03:55,810 --> 05:03:56,970
Do not move!

7972
05:03:57,270 --> 05:03:58,770
You'll be so safe!

7973
05:04:00,810 --> 05:04:02,190
Just do not move!

7974
05:04:04,350 --> 05:04:04,950
Okay.

7975
05:04:05,830 --> 05:04:06,490
Never mind.

7976
05:04:06,590 --> 05:04:07,370
It stopped working.

7977
05:04:07,850 --> 05:04:09,250
We almost had it.

7978
05:04:09,890 --> 05:04:11,810
We almost had it there.

7979
05:04:13,070 --> 05:04:14,730
We almost got it.

7980
05:04:15,150 --> 05:04:16,410
What could have been?

7981
05:04:16,970 --> 05:04:18,370
What could have been?

7982
05:04:18,370 --> 05:04:19,850
Just stay in the car!

7983
05:04:19,990 --> 05:04:21,610
Just stay in the car and keep bouncing!

7984
05:04:23,230 --> 05:04:24,090
You got this!

7985
05:04:26,690 --> 05:04:27,650
You got this!

7986
05:04:27,710 --> 05:04:28,650
Just stay there forever!

7987
05:04:32,150 --> 05:04:32,950
Oh, shit.

7988
05:04:33,070 --> 05:04:35,410

05:04:37,670 --> 05:04:38,110
Alright.

7992
05:04:39,370 --> 05:04:39,810

Alright.

7998
05:04:44,010 --> 05:04:44,690
There you go.

7999
05:04:45,330 --> 05:04:45,770
Yeah.

8000
05:04:45,830 --> 05:04:46,930
I have only have one bat.

8001
05:04:48,370 --> 05:04:50,390
I only have one bat here.

8002
05:04:51,430 --> 05:04:54,190
Okay, as long as I am in the air, nothing can hurt me.

8003
05:04:54,650 --> 05:04:56,470
As long as I am in the...

Alright.

Here you go.

8011
05:05:02,750 --> 05:05:04,950
As long as I am in the air, no one can hurt me.

8012
05:05:05,310 --> 05:05:06,910
This is the launch if we are going...

8013
05:05:06,910 --> 05:05:07,350

8047
05:06:05,480 --> 05:06:07,760
I fucking knew it was gonna be clutch right there.

8048
05:06:08,040 --> 05:06:09,480

How much support we got...

8128
05:08:33,010 --> 05:08:36,370
On the charity itself.

8129
05:08:36,830 --> 05:08:39,430
It really blows my mind.

8130
05:08:40,230 --> 05:08:42,350
$72,000.

8131
05:08:44,150 --> 05:08:44,990

So much.

8139
05:08:57,790 --> 05:08:58,430
We made like...

8140
05:09:00,430 --> 05:09:02,350
$140,000.

8141
05:09:02,910 --> 05:09:04,370
That's actually...

8142
05:09:04,370 --> 05:09:04,850
Um...

8143
05:09:06,470 --> 05:09:06,950
Crazy.

8144
05:09:07,630 --> 05:09:08,210
Guys.

8145
05:09:08,310 --> 05:09:09,250
All I'm saying...

8146
05:09:09,250 --> 05:09:10,310
Is if we get...

8147
05:09:10,310 --> 05:09:11,870
10k...

8148
05:09:12,330 --> 05:09:15,090
If we manage to get...

8149
05:09:15,090 --> 05:09:16,230
Uh...

8150
05:09:16,230 --> 05:09:18,470
10 more thousand dollars...

8151
05:09:18,470 --> 05:09:20,010
We can have...

8152
05:09:20,010 --> 05:09:22,190
My dad... Human dad...

8153
05:09:22,190 --> 05:09:25,090
By the way... Stream on his PS5 for you.

8154
05:09:25,230 --> 05:09:26,030
That's what I'm saying.

8155
05:09:26,510 --> 05:09:28,590
And with only 10k...

8156
05:09:28,610 --> 05:09:29,570
Hahaha.

8157
05:09:31,430 --> 05:09:32,030
Hahaha.

8158
05:09:33,210 --> 05:09:34,670
We are almost there.

8159
05:09:35,670 --> 05:09:36,270
Alright.

8160
05:09:36,310 --> 05:09:36,570
Let me...

8161
05:09:36,570 --> 05:09:38,470
Actually let me do the calculation real quick.

8162
05:09:38,570 --> 05:09:39,330
Just to be sure.

8163
05:09:39,630 --> 05:09:41,390
Just to be sure.

8164
05:09:43,550 --> 05:09:44,150
Yes.

8165
05:09:45,090 --> 05:09:45,690
The...

8166
05:09:45,690 --> 05:09:47,270
Father stream.

8167
05:09:47,650 --> 05:09:49,350
The father stream.

8168
05:09:51,130 --> 05:09:51,730
Guys.

8169
05:09:52,930 --> 05:09:53,530
Alright.

8170
05:09:53,590 --> 05:09:54,510
I'll give you guys a choice.

8171
05:09:54,710 --> 05:09:55,910
It's either... Okay.

8172
05:09:55,970 --> 05:09:56,270
Guys.

8173
05:09:56,390 --> 05:09:57,030
You know what?

8174
05:09:57,350 --> 05:09:58,510
I'll even throw...

8175
05:09:58,610 --> 05:09:59,270
In an extra.

8176
05:09:59,350 --> 05:10:00,530
I'll even do...

8177
05:10:00,530 --> 05:10:02,250
The Pokemon Smasher Pass.

8178
05:10:02,630 --> 05:10:03,750
If you guys get there.

8179
05:10:03,790 --> 05:10:04,370
I know it's a...

8180
05:10:04,370 --> 05:10:05,310
200k goal.

8181
05:10:06,930 --> 05:10:07,610
But...

8182
05:10:07,610 --> 05:10:09,430
I'll even do...

8183
05:10:09,430 --> 05:10:11,470
The Pokemon Smasher Pass.

8184
05:10:12,210 --> 05:10:12,850
Hahaha.

8185
05:10:14,410 --> 05:10:16,530
If you guys get to 10k...

8186
05:10:16,530 --> 05:10:18,830
If you guys get to 150k...

8187
05:10:18,830 --> 05:10:20,370
Um... We are currently...

8188
05:10:20,370 --> 05:10:21,810
At 140k.

8189
05:10:21,810 --> 05:10:22,510
So we...

8190
05:10:22,510 --> 05:10:23,630
Need... Uh...

8191
05:10:23,630 --> 05:10:25,590
78,000...

8192
05:10:25,590 --> 05:10:27,630
To have both Pokemon...

8193
05:10:28,610 --> 05:10:28,710
Smasher Pass.

8194
05:10:29,350 --> 05:10:30,110
And...

8195
05:10:30,110 --> 05:10:31,210
The dad stream.

8196
05:10:31,590 --> 05:10:33,950
The Doki dad stream.

8197
05:10:34,410 --> 05:10:35,170
Uh...

8198
05:10:36,550 --> 05:10:37,590
Why not...

8199
05:10:37,590 --> 05:10:38,410
No.

8200
05:10:40,470 --> 05:10:40,850
No.

8201
05:10:40,850 --> 05:10:42,170
Don't do this to...

8202
05:10:42,170 --> 05:10:42,390
The power.

8203
05:10:42,730 --> 05:10:44,470
Don't do this to...

8204
05:10:44,470 --> 05:10:44,830
Power.

8205
05:10:48,330 --> 05:10:50,270
But it has been...

8206
05:10:50,270 --> 05:10:51,010
Crazy though.

8207
05:10:51,230 --> 05:10:52,690
I think we raised in total...

8208
05:10:52,690 --> 05:10:54,650
Almost 200k dollars though.

8209
05:10:54,910 --> 05:10:56,430
Uh... We include the...

8210
05:10:56,430 --> 05:10:57,190
Uh...

8211
05:11:01,040 --> 05:11:02,360
No Visage though.

8212
05:11:02,380 --> 05:11:03,100
Thank fucking god.

8213
05:11:03,240 --> 05:11:03,760
Hahaha.

8214
05:11:04,780 --> 05:11:04,840
Hahaha.

8215
05:11:06,640 --> 05:11:07,060
Hahaha.

8216
05:11:08,920 --> 05:11:11,260
Um... I'm so happy...

8217
05:11:11,260 --> 05:11:12,380
We didn't get Visage.

8218
05:11:12,680 --> 05:11:13,940
Thank goodness.

8219
05:11:14,260 --> 05:11:15,340
Thank goodness.

8220
05:11:15,840 --> 05:11:16,280
Hahaha.

8221
05:11:26,360 --> 05:11:27,200
All

8222
05:11:30,780 --> 05:11:32,140
I'm saying...

8223
05:11:32,140 --> 05:11:34,180
All I'm saying...

8224
05:11:34,180 --> 05:11:35,920
Is that if I have...

8225
05:11:35,920 --> 05:11:37,600
Any... Billion...

8226
05:11:37,600 --> 05:11:39,980
Any billionaire's son or daughter...

8227
05:11:39,980 --> 05:11:41,220
Right now...

8228
05:11:45,800 --> 05:11:46,160
I'm gonna...

8229
05:11:46,160 --> 05:11:47,520
Reminding that we originally said...

8230
05:11:47,520 --> 05:11:48,840
200k for Visage.

8231
05:11:49,180 --> 05:11:50,420
No, no, no, no, no, no.

8232
05:11:50,900 --> 05:11:51,860
No, no, no, no, no.

8233
05:11:51,920 --> 05:11:52,120
Okay.

8234
05:11:52,200 --> 05:11:52,600
You know what?

8235
05:11:53,520 --> 05:11:54,340
You know what guys?

8236
05:11:54,900 --> 05:11:55,260
Okay.

8237
05:11:55,320 --> 05:11:56,120
I'm gonna throw you a bone.

8238
05:11:56,340 --> 05:11:58,260
I'm gonna throw you... Because I feel so nice right now.

8239
05:11:58,760 --> 05:11:59,940
I'm gonna throw you guys a bone.

8240
05:12:00,080 --> 05:12:00,360
Chat.

8241
05:12:01,780 --> 05:12:02,140
Because...

8242
05:12:02,140 --> 05:12:03,760
I feel incredibly generous.

8243
05:12:05,820 --> 05:12:06,180
If...

8244
05:12:07,040 --> 05:12:07,400
If...

8245
05:12:07,400 --> 05:12:09,060
We hit...

8246
05:12:09,060 --> 05:12:10,120
On the Tiltify...

8247
05:12:10,120 --> 05:12:11,860
If we hit...

8248
05:12:13,000 --> 05:12:13,680
78...

8249
05:12:15,540 --> 05:12:16,220
Thousand...

8250
05:12:17,100 --> 05:12:19,560
I will play one chapter of Visage.

8251
05:12:19,880 --> 05:12:22,100
I'll do one chapter of the Visage.

8252
05:12:22,540 --> 05:12:23,220
And...

8253
05:12:23,220 --> 05:12:25,280
The Pokemon Smasher Pass.

8254
05:12:25,560 --> 05:12:27,480
We're gonna take away the human...

8255
05:12:27,480 --> 05:12:29,260
My dad playing on his PS5.

8256
05:12:29,360 --> 05:12:30,380
Streaming on his PS5.

8257
05:12:30,540 --> 05:12:31,560
I'm gonna substitute.

8258
05:12:32,500 --> 05:12:34,400
I will substitute...

8259
05:12:35,700 --> 05:12:37,060
For... playing...

8260
05:12:37,400 --> 05:12:37,720
Visage.

8261
05:12:38,000 --> 05:12:38,980
One chapter.

8262
05:12:40,120 --> 05:12:41,540
If we hit...

8263
05:12:41,540 --> 05:12:43,100
On the Tiltify...

8264
05:12:43,100 --> 05:12:45,000
On the... On the stretch goal.

8265
05:12:46,320 --> 05:12:46,920
78...

8266
05:12:46,920 --> 05:12:47,660
Okay, okay.

8267
05:12:47,700 --> 05:12:48,400
I'll give you... Alright!

8268
05:12:48,680 --> 05:12:49,580
I'll give you three!

8269
05:12:50,440 --> 05:12:51,040
Alright!

8270
05:12:51,160 --> 05:12:53,080
I feel incredibly generous...

8271
05:12:53,080 --> 05:12:53,720
Right now.

8272
05:12:58,120 --> 05:12:59,620
We don't want you...

8273
05:12:59,620 --> 05:13:00,040
Doki!

8274
05:13:00,180 --> 05:13:01,240
We want your...

8275
05:13:01,240 --> 05:13:01,760
Father!

8276
05:13:03,500 --> 05:13:05,420
Both... Both are gay!

8277
05:13:05,620 --> 05:13:07,180
How dare you take... Okay!

8278
05:13:07,400 --> 05:13:08,000
Alright!

8279
05:13:08,220 --> 05:13:08,500
Alright!

8280
05:13:08,860 --> 05:13:11,460
If we hit...

8281
05:13:11,460 --> 05:13:13,500
78...

8282
05:13:13,500 --> 05:13:14,520
Thousand...

8283
05:13:15,220 --> 05:13:16,260
You get...

8284
05:13:16,260 --> 05:13:18,320
Pokemon Smasher Pass...

8285
05:13:18,840 --> 05:13:19,860
You get...

8286
05:13:19,860 --> 05:13:22,180
The Dad PS5 Stream...

8287
05:13:22,180 --> 05:13:24,280
And... Visage...

8288
05:13:24,280 --> 05:13:25,460
One chapter.

8289
05:13:26,120 --> 05:13:27,380
One chapter.

8290
05:13:27,700 --> 05:13:29,260
That's all I'll give you.

8291
05:13:29,440 --> 05:13:30,020
Hahahaha!

8292
05:13:31,660 --> 05:13:32,860
Hahahaha!

8293
05:13:34,120 --> 05:13:35,320
Hahahaha!

8294
05:13:37,840 --> 05:13:38,620
Look...

8295
05:13:39,400 --> 05:13:41,000
I don't think... Cause like someone's like...

8296
05:13:41,000 --> 05:13:42,540
100k on Tiltify...

8297
05:13:42,540 --> 05:13:44,780
For the full game...

8298
05:13:44,780 --> 05:13:45,300
Look!

8299
05:13:45,340 --> 05:13:46,660
I'll entertain you guys!

8300
05:13:46,940 --> 05:13:48,840
I'll even entertain you with this!

8301
05:13:49,020 --> 05:13:50,740
If you manage...

8302
05:13:50,740 --> 05:13:53,300
To get... 100k...

8303
05:13:53,300 --> 05:13:54,240
On Tiltify...

8304
05:13:55,460 --> 05:13:56,240
Umm...

8305
05:13:56,240 --> 05:13:59,220
Before the stream is over... I'll give you guys...

8306
05:13:59,220 --> 05:14:00,460
30 more minutes.

8307
05:14:01,240 --> 05:14:02,020
Hahahaha!

8308
05:14:03,250 --> 05:14:04,660
I'll give you guys...

8309
05:14:05,230 --> 05:14:06,600
30 more minutes...

8310
05:14:07,400 --> 05:14:08,900
If you manage to hit...

8311
05:14:09,820 --> 05:14:10,420
100k...

8312
05:14:10,420 --> 05:14:12,800
On the Tiltify itself...

8313
05:14:13,400 --> 05:14:14,600
You get the full game.

8314
05:14:15,640 --> 05:14:17,200
You get the full game.

8315
05:14:17,320 --> 05:14:18,960
This does not include the auction.

8316
05:14:19,340 --> 05:14:20,260
By the way.

8317
05:14:20,940 --> 05:14:23,080
This does not include the auction.

8318
05:14:24,240 --> 05:14:24,840
Hahahaha!

8319
05:14:24,840 --> 05:14:27,040
Not enough time, unfortunately.

8320
05:14:27,800 --> 05:14:28,680
What are you?

8321
05:14:28,740 --> 05:14:29,440
A quitter?

8322
05:14:29,980 --> 05:14:30,580
Hahahaha!

8323
05:14:34,380 --> 05:14:34,980
Hahahaha!

8324
05:14:35,820 --> 05:14:36,920
How is this?

8325
05:14:37,400 --> 05:14:38,580
That is not a scam.

8326
05:14:39,100 --> 05:14:40,500
That is not a scam.

8327
05:14:40,820 --> 05:14:43,400
I literally went from 400k...

8328
05:14:43,960 --> 05:14:45,640
To 100k.

8329
05:14:46,480 --> 05:14:47,120
Guys...

8330
05:14:47,120 --> 05:14:48,940
I literally went from...

8331
05:14:49,740 --> 05:14:51,300
400k to a...

8332
05:14:51,300 --> 05:14:53,220
That is like the most...

8333
05:14:53,220 --> 05:14:54,940
Bargain you could ever get.

8334
05:14:55,020 --> 05:14:57,080
That is like 70% off.

8335
05:14:57,380 --> 05:14:59,120
For my own sanity.

8336
05:14:59,400 --> 05:15:01,460
And I'm giving you 30 minutes...

8337
05:15:01,460 --> 05:15:02,340
To reach that.

8338
05:15:03,380 --> 05:15:05,180
To be fair...

8339
05:15:05,180 --> 05:15:06,160
Yeah!

8340
05:15:06,280 --> 05:15:07,380
It went down...

8341
05:15:07,400 --> 05:15:09,020
From 400k.

8342
05:15:10,620 --> 05:15:12,080
400k was a scam to be...

8343
05:15:12,080 --> 05:15:14,660
But it didn't turn into a scam in the end!

8344
05:15:14,760 --> 05:15:16,980
Because I lowered it down to 100k!

8345
05:15:17,580 --> 05:15:18,060
Hahahaha!

8346
05:15:18,760 --> 05:15:19,720
But this...

8347
05:15:19,720 --> 05:15:21,560
Does not include...

8348
05:15:21,560 --> 05:15:22,460
The auction.

8349
05:15:23,260 --> 05:15:24,780
This does not include the auction.

8350
05:15:25,020 --> 05:15:25,660
You have to...

8351
05:15:25,660 --> 05:15:26,900
The moment...

8352
05:15:26,900 --> 05:15:28,740
Look, I'll even be more generous.

8353
05:15:29,040 --> 05:15:29,440
Fine.

8354
05:15:29,760 --> 05:15:31,820
Guys, never say I was not nice.

8355
05:15:32,300 --> 05:15:32,780
Hahahaha!

8356
05:15:32,780 --> 05:15:33,960
Hahahaha!

8357
05:15:35,260 --> 05:15:37,820
Never say I was not generous.

8358
05:15:38,240 --> 05:15:40,320
But I'll even give you until...

8359
05:15:40,320 --> 05:15:43,260
My OBS hits 6 hours.

8360
05:15:43,400 --> 05:15:44,320
Until my...

8361
05:15:44,320 --> 05:15:45,190
The moment...

8362
05:15:45,460 --> 05:15:48,360
My OBS hits 6 hours.

8363
05:15:48,500 --> 05:15:49,660
Which is...

8364
05:15:49,660 --> 05:15:50,500
Um...

8365
05:15:50,500 --> 05:15:51,900
Hahahaha!

8366
05:15:54,580 --> 05:15:56,380
Which is...

8367
05:15:56,380 --> 05:15:58,520
Which is like...

8368
05:15:58,520 --> 05:15:59,660
Okay, let me count.

8369
05:16:00,620 --> 05:16:02,180
Which is in 40...

8370
05:16:02,780 --> 05:16:04,480
I'm giving you 40 minutes, guys.

8371
05:16:05,000 --> 05:16:07,680
I'm literally giving you...

8372
05:16:07,680 --> 05:16:08,780
40 minutes...

8373
05:16:09,380 --> 05:16:10,540
To hit that.

8374
05:16:10,820 --> 05:16:12,100
Guys, I'm gonna...

8375
05:16:12,100 --> 05:16:14,060
It's not fake Jitter Rob!

8376
05:16:14,160 --> 05:16:16,660
I literally gave you a 10 minute extension!

8377
05:16:17,340 --> 05:16:18,400
What do you mean?

8378
05:16:19,500 --> 05:16:20,060
I...

8379
05:16:20,060 --> 05:16:22,880
Alright, you guys debate amongst yourself.

8380
05:16:23,100 --> 05:16:24,380
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

8381
05:16:24,680 --> 05:16:25,020
It's been...

8382
05:16:25,020 --> 05:16:27,360
It's been fucking 5 hours.

8383
05:16:27,480 --> 05:16:28,980
I have not had a bathroom break.

8384
05:16:29,060 --> 05:16:30,240
I'm gonna be right back, chat.

8385
05:17:54,400 --> 05:17:54,620
Alright.

8386
05:17:54,860 --> 05:17:57,000
Yeah, I don't think we're gonna be hitting that 100k.

8387
05:17:57,280 --> 05:17:57,800
Hahahaha!

8388
05:18:00,080 --> 05:18:00,640
Hahahaha!

8389
05:18:02,180 --> 05:18:04,760
I like how someone's still trying to bargain.

8390
05:18:04,940 --> 05:18:06,120
It was like, what about...

8391
05:18:06,120 --> 05:18:07,200
5 dollars?

8392
05:18:08,760 --> 05:18:10,600
Guys, I was very...

8393
05:18:10,600 --> 05:18:12,080
Perfectly clear...

8394
05:18:12,080 --> 05:18:13,660
On how this is gonna go.

8395
05:18:13,840 --> 05:18:15,400
I don't listen perfectly.

8396
05:18:16,440 --> 05:18:17,960
Let it be 80...

8397
05:18:17,960 --> 05:18:19,160
Okay, okay.

8398
05:18:20,060 --> 05:18:20,620
90k.

8399
05:18:21,000 --> 05:18:21,980
Final offer.

8400
05:18:22,260 --> 05:18:23,820
It is 5...

8401
05:18:24,400 --> 05:18:25,360
I cannot say it's a scam.

8402
05:18:25,560 --> 05:18:27,640
I literally went down from 400k.

8403
05:18:27,980 --> 05:18:28,460
Hahahaha!

8404
05:18:31,220 --> 05:18:31,700
Alright.

8405
05:18:31,980 --> 05:18:32,360
Alright.

8406
05:18:32,840 --> 05:18:33,820
Final offer.

8407
05:18:34,000 --> 05:18:35,800
You're not... you're not like...

8408
05:18:36,360 --> 05:18:37,100
Weathering me down.

8409
05:18:37,440 --> 05:18:38,800
Like, I know what you guys are trying to do.

8410
05:18:38,940 --> 05:18:41,620
You guys are trying to like, weather me down...

8411
05:18:41,620 --> 05:18:43,340
More and more...

8412
05:18:43,340 --> 05:18:45,800
Until like, I get to the number you want.

8413
05:18:45,940 --> 05:18:47,140
Like, you're trying...

8414
05:18:47,800 --> 05:18:50,160
Don't think I don't know what you're doing right now.

8415
05:18:50,320 --> 05:18:51,560
Don't think I don't know.

8416
05:18:52,600 --> 05:18:53,540
90k!

8417
05:18:53,720 --> 05:18:55,260
That is...

8418
05:18:55,260 --> 05:18:57,040
Absolutely...

8419
05:18:57,350 --> 05:18:58,980
My final offer.

8420
05:18:59,120 --> 05:19:01,480
I will not go below that.

8421
05:19:01,680 --> 05:19:03,320
There is no way.

8422
05:19:03,880 --> 05:19:05,760
We've done it before.

8423
05:19:07,470 --> 05:19:08,920
It's called haggling.

8424
05:19:09,000 --> 05:19:09,480
Yes!

8425
05:19:09,600 --> 05:19:10,740
Haggling's over!

8426
05:19:13,270 --> 05:19:14,280
You have...

8427
05:19:15,320 --> 05:19:16,860
30... 40...

8428
05:19:16,860 --> 05:19:18,240
35 minutes.

8429
05:19:18,240 --> 05:19:19,320
You have...

8430
05:19:19,900 --> 05:19:21,260
35 minutes.

8431
05:19:21,600 --> 05:19:23,740
To hit 90k.

8432
05:19:23,980 --> 05:19:26,520
And with that 90k...

8433
05:19:26,520 --> 05:19:27,440
I...

8434
05:19:27,440 --> 05:19:29,520
Will fully play Visage.

8435
05:19:31,180 --> 05:19:32,420
This is...

8436
05:19:32,420 --> 05:19:34,080
This is for charity.

8437
05:19:34,100 --> 05:19:35,540
There's no haggling.

8438
05:19:36,480 --> 05:19:37,360
Hahahaha!

8439
05:19:38,760 --> 05:19:39,600
Hahahaha!

8440
05:19:40,800 --> 05:19:41,680
Guys!

8441
05:19:42,120 --> 05:19:44,320
Look, you have to be reasonable guys.

8442
05:19:44,660 --> 05:19:46,480
You have to be reasonable about my...

8443
05:19:46,480 --> 05:19:47,520
Mental health.

8444
05:19:47,600 --> 05:19:48,060
For the...

8445
05:19:48,240 --> 05:19:48,980
Mental health.

8446
05:19:49,160 --> 05:19:51,760
For the brain and behavior foundation.

8447
05:19:53,240 --> 05:19:54,080
Hahahaha!

8448
05:19:57,180 --> 05:19:58,020
Hahahaha!

8449
05:19:58,020 --> 05:19:58,100
Hahahaha!

8450
05:19:58,600 --> 05:20:00,700
Look, I did say...

8451
05:20:02,060 --> 05:20:03,960
I did say...

8452
05:20:03,960 --> 05:20:04,500
I did say...

8453
05:20:04,500 --> 05:20:05,140
Seven...

8454
05:20:06,200 --> 05:20:07,040
78...

8455
05:20:07,040 --> 05:20:08,140
Holy shit!

8456
05:20:08,420 --> 05:20:09,660
Oh my god!

8457
05:20:09,820 --> 05:20:11,820
We jumped $6000!

8458
05:20:13,800 --> 05:20:14,640
Holy...

8459
05:20:14,640 --> 05:20:16,020
Guys...

8460
05:20:16,020 --> 05:20:17,400
Uh...

8461
05:20:18,240 --> 05:20:18,560
Guys, we're like...

8462
05:20:18,560 --> 05:20:19,800
Keep talking to Doki.

8463
05:20:19,880 --> 05:20:21,180
She adds more perks guys.

8464
05:20:21,300 --> 05:20:22,200
She's desperate.

8465
05:20:22,460 --> 05:20:23,780
Guys, keep talking.

8466
05:20:24,020 --> 05:20:26,800
The more we weather her down, the more she'll give us.

8467
05:20:26,920 --> 05:20:30,200
The more everything is attainable now guys.

8468
05:20:30,420 --> 05:20:32,760
We have to keep weathering her down.

8469
05:20:33,140 --> 05:20:35,000
She's gonna give up eventually.

8470
05:20:41,540 --> 05:20:43,980
If everyone just donates.

8471
05:20:44,160 --> 05:20:45,540
Keep stalling.

8472
05:20:45,540 --> 05:20:47,280
Guys, stop figuring us out.

8473
05:20:47,360 --> 05:20:48,080
Guys, no more!

8474
05:20:48,340 --> 05:20:50,560
I will not be giving any more perks.

8475
05:20:51,200 --> 05:20:55,240
I will not be getting... no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

8476
05:20:55,900 --> 05:20:58,420
You're not getting any more perks from me, chat.

8477
05:20:58,640 --> 05:21:00,080
We've established...

8478
05:21:00,080 --> 05:21:03,760
We have established 90k.

8479
05:21:03,820 --> 05:21:05,360
That is the lowest I will go.

8480
05:21:05,780 --> 05:21:07,740
That is the lowest you will bargain with me.

8481
05:21:08,000 --> 05:21:09,380
I'm literally Asian.

8482
05:21:09,580 --> 05:21:10,820
You can't out-haggle me.

8483
05:21:14,740 --> 05:21:19,660
There is in no possible way you can out-haggle me.

8484
05:21:19,860 --> 05:21:20,980
I'm literally Asian.

8485
05:21:21,220 --> 05:21:23,280
I lived in Asia.

8486
05:21:23,380 --> 05:21:26,020
I had to haggle for real there.

8487
05:21:29,540 --> 05:21:35,720
But only if you get to 90k will I fully play Visage.

8488
05:21:35,920 --> 05:21:36,540
What?

8489
05:21:37,120 --> 05:21:38,600
Oh my god, we're almost there!

8490
05:21:40,220 --> 05:21:40,820
Dragoons!

8491
05:21:40,920 --> 05:21:41,760
1k more!

8492
05:21:42,020 --> 05:21:44,540
And you get the first chapter of Visage.

8493
05:21:50,180 --> 05:21:53,780
You get the first chapter of Visage.

8494
05:21:56,700 --> 05:22:00,800
And one more K and then you get first chapter.

8495
05:22:02,820 --> 05:22:04,180
You should be proud of it.

8496
05:22:04,180 --> 05:22:08,580
But honestly, Dragoons, you guys should be proud of yourself to raise this much money for 2k.

8497
05:22:08,600 --> 05:22:09,360
You should be proud of yourself to raise this much money for 2k.

8498
05:22:09,360 --> 05:22:16,020
It's actually insane how much you guys all worked together for such a great cause.

8499
05:22:16,220 --> 05:22:16,620
You know what?

8500
05:22:16,780 --> 05:22:17,940
Alright, hey guys.

8501
05:22:22,800 --> 05:22:23,320
Guys.

8502
05:22:23,320 --> 05:22:24,060
Okay, wait.

8503
05:22:24,160 --> 05:22:24,680
Let me see.

8504
05:22:26,660 --> 05:22:29,320
Guys, I'll give you guys... You know what?

8505
05:22:31,200 --> 05:22:32,320
You know what, guys?

8506
05:22:32,660 --> 05:22:33,340
Don't worry.

8507
05:22:34,820 --> 05:22:35,580
Let's see.

8508
05:22:36,860 --> 05:22:37,380
10k.

8509
05:22:37,620 --> 05:22:37,740
No!

8510
05:22:37,740 --> 05:22:38,540
What do you mean?

8511
05:22:38,900 --> 05:22:40,240
Oh my god.

8512
05:22:45,220 --> 05:22:47,320
I just sent in 10 dollars.

8513
05:22:50,140 --> 05:22:51,880
For my own charity.

8514
05:22:52,100 --> 05:22:54,100
I just put in 10 dollars.

8515
05:22:54,160 --> 05:22:54,780
Don't worry, guys.

8516
05:22:54,980 --> 05:22:56,320
I'm gonna help out.

8517
05:23:02,300 --> 05:23:03,740
She shows weakness.

8518
05:23:03,940 --> 05:23:04,680
Now is our time.

8519
05:23:04,780 --> 05:23:05,080
No!

8520
05:23:05,120 --> 05:23:06,220
This is not weakness!

8521
05:23:06,220 --> 05:23:09,140
I am helping you guys out.

8522
05:23:09,380 --> 05:23:11,080
Do not take this as weakness.

8523
05:23:11,400 --> 05:23:14,080
Do not take this as weakness, guys.

8524
05:23:14,420 --> 05:23:15,060
Alright.

8525
05:23:16,620 --> 05:23:17,260
Okay.

8526
05:23:19,340 --> 05:23:20,620
For charity.

8527
05:23:22,300 --> 05:23:23,720
I'm doing my part.

8528
05:23:25,280 --> 05:23:26,780
I'm doing my part.

8529
05:23:27,520 --> 05:23:28,160
Boop.

8530
05:23:29,140 --> 05:23:32,340
I'll give you guys the first chapter of Visage.

8531
05:23:35,100 --> 05:23:35,740
I'll give you guys the first chapter of Visage.

8532
05:23:35,740 --> 05:23:36,200
I'm doing my part.

8533
05:23:36,220 --> 05:23:37,240
You're welcome.

8534
05:23:37,540 --> 05:23:39,440
You're welcome.

8535
05:23:39,460 --> 05:23:40,600
You're welcome.

8536
05:23:40,760 --> 05:23:42,120
I did it for you guys.

8537
05:23:42,400 --> 05:23:49,480
I gave you the first chapter of Visage right there.

8538
05:23:51,160 --> 05:23:53,960
I added an extra zero.

8539
05:23:54,240 --> 05:23:55,720
I could have been 10!

8540
05:23:57,040 --> 05:23:59,780
I never said what chapter it was.

8541
05:23:59,940 --> 05:24:02,120
A tutorial level is technically a chapter.

8542
05:24:04,680 --> 05:24:06,200
I never said what chapter it was.

8543
05:24:06,220 --> 05:24:06,880
I'm just saying.

8544
05:24:06,880 --> 05:24:08,480
If you think about it...

8545
05:24:08,480 --> 05:24:09,820
Hmm...

8546
05:24:12,860 --> 05:24:13,580
Scam.

8547
05:24:13,860 --> 05:24:14,440
No!

8548
05:24:15,900 --> 05:24:16,720
The scam!

8549
05:24:16,860 --> 05:24:18,760
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

8550
05:24:19,140 --> 05:24:21,460
I will do one chapter.

8551
05:24:22,220 --> 05:24:23,900
I'll do 30 more minutes.

8552
05:24:24,260 --> 05:24:24,940
Tic-Tac!

8553
05:24:25,140 --> 05:24:26,860
30 more minutes!

8554
05:24:31,900 --> 05:24:32,620
Alright.

8555
05:24:34,560 --> 05:24:35,280
Since...

8556
05:24:35,280 --> 05:24:35,780
Since...

8557
05:24:35,780 --> 05:24:36,000
Since...

8558
05:24:36,680 --> 05:24:37,560
Alright, guys...

8559
05:24:38,080 --> 05:24:38,300
Since...

8560
05:24:38,300 --> 05:24:39,500
We are at...

8561
05:24:39,500 --> 05:24:40,300
We got the...

8562
05:24:41,100 --> 05:24:43,080
Okay, I'm not gonna do Pokémon.

8563
05:24:43,300 --> 05:24:44,520
I need to be like...

8564
05:24:44,520 --> 05:24:45,800
Hanging in the mines.

8565
05:24:45,840 --> 05:24:46,940
I feel like I need a drink for that.

8566
05:24:48,580 --> 05:24:50,000
I feel like...

8567
05:24:51,720 --> 05:24:52,620
Guys, I'm sorry.

8568
05:24:52,700 --> 05:24:55,000
I feel like I need a drink for Pokémon Smash or Pass.

8569
05:24:55,120 --> 05:24:56,680
I cannot do it live right now.

8570
05:24:56,680 --> 05:24:58,880
I cannot do it live right now.

8571
05:24:58,980 --> 05:24:59,840
I need a...

8572
05:24:59,840 --> 05:25:03,200
I need a drink for Pokémon Smash, or Pass.

8573
05:25:03,200 --> 05:25:04,020
Yes, yes.

8574
05:25:04,440 --> 05:25:08,060
There's no fucking way I am going to be doing that sober.

8575
05:25:08,420 --> 05:25:10,560
There's no- I'm not drinking now!

8576
05:25:10,860 --> 05:25:14,520
Who the fuck named themselves Doki Scammerbird?

8577
05:25:14,640 --> 05:25:16,540
I literally gave 1k!

8578
05:25:17,420 --> 05:25:19,540
You cannot say I'm scamming!

8579
05:25:19,620 --> 05:25:22,580
I gave 1k to charity!

8580
05:25:27,720 --> 05:25:29,300
Alright, the Pokemon...

8581
05:25:29,800 --> 05:25:31,880
We have Visage Chapter 1.

8582
05:25:32,140 --> 05:25:33,960
A Pokemon Smasher Pass.

8583
05:25:33,960 --> 05:25:39,480
And I'm gonna do that drunk because I cannot be so- There's no way I'm gonna be sober for this.

8584
05:25:40,800 --> 05:25:42,000
Oh my god, 10k!

8585
05:25:42,240 --> 05:25:42,660
Guys!

8586
05:25:43,180 --> 05:25:43,960
10 more k!

8587
05:25:45,180 --> 05:25:46,020
10 more k!

8588
05:25:47,320 --> 05:25:49,160
And then you get the full- Okay, I pulled 95.

8589
05:25:50,260 --> 05:25:50,680
95?

8590
05:25:51,280 --> 05:25:52,260
Do we agree on that?

8591
05:25:55,100 --> 05:25:58,700
Okay, I know like we said 90k.

8592
05:25:59,160 --> 05:26:01,400
But what about 95k?

8593
05:26:03,960 --> 05:26:05,180
Yo, yo, stop!

8594
05:26:05,720 --> 05:26:08,260
Okay, guys, just think about it, guys.

8595
05:26:08,440 --> 05:26:13,860
Wouldn't it be funny if it was 95k instead of 90k?

8596
05:26:14,440 --> 05:26:15,860
No, I said 90!

8597
05:26:16,020 --> 05:26:16,720
No, no, no, no.

8598
05:26:16,720 --> 05:26:18,540
You guys cannot gaslit me into thinking 85.

8599
05:26:19,080 --> 05:26:21,400
You guys cannot gaslit me thinking it was 85.

8600
05:26:22,060 --> 05:26:22,540
90.

8601
05:26:22,680 --> 05:26:23,160
90k.

8602
05:26:24,820 --> 05:26:26,240
Oh wait, 95 full game?

8603
05:26:26,560 --> 05:26:27,720
Look, the blind and deaf.

8604
05:26:28,360 --> 05:26:30,060
The blind and deaf says 95.

8605
05:26:30,300 --> 05:26:30,860
They agree.

8606
05:26:31,080 --> 05:26:32,320
They agree to it.

8607
05:26:32,560 --> 05:26:33,460
They agree.

8608
05:26:34,200 --> 05:26:35,860
No, no, I never said 85.

8609
05:26:36,680 --> 05:26:38,120
I never said 85.

8610
05:26:38,360 --> 05:26:39,700
I said 90.

8611
05:26:40,160 --> 05:26:42,580
I said I was willing to go down 90.

8612
05:26:44,160 --> 05:26:46,940
Now I know you guys are gaslighting me.

8613
05:26:47,140 --> 05:26:50,100
I know for a fact that it was 90k.

8614
05:26:55,380 --> 05:26:57,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

8615
05:26:57,640 --> 05:26:59,080
I remember it was 90.

8616
05:26:59,420 --> 05:27:00,800
I remember, chat.

8617
05:27:00,940 --> 05:27:02,040
You can't gaslight me.

8618
05:27:02,760 --> 05:27:03,940
You can't gaslight me.

8619
05:27:03,940 --> 05:27:04,180
I'm not going to be on this.

8620
05:27:10,060 --> 05:27:11,960
You can't gaslight me.

8621
05:27:14,080 --> 05:27:15,380
I swear to God.

8622
05:27:15,580 --> 05:27:15,800
Okay.

8623
05:27:17,620 --> 05:27:23,760
But honestly, the amount we've accomplished today has been amazing.

8624
05:27:24,520 --> 05:27:28,520
Like, and the charity, the auction isn't even over.

8625
05:27:29,580 --> 05:27:31,520
The auction isn't even over.

8626
05:27:31,620 --> 05:27:32,760
We still have, like...

8627
05:27:32,760 --> 05:27:33,920
Guys, I'm sorry.

8628
05:27:33,940 --> 05:27:34,840
24 minus...

8629
05:27:37,840 --> 05:27:38,720
Okay, guys.

8630
05:27:39,000 --> 05:27:41,700
Okay, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18.

8631
05:27:42,120 --> 05:27:46,300
We still have 18 hours left out of the auction.

8632
05:27:46,740 --> 05:27:48,640
And the fact that we were able to...

8633
05:27:50,120 --> 05:27:55,320
We were able to raise so much.

8634
05:27:55,420 --> 05:27:59,140
Normally, a lot of charity streams, they're like 24 hours or like multiple days.

8635
05:27:59,560 --> 05:28:01,840
But the fact that, like, you know, the stream itself...

8636
05:28:01,840 --> 05:28:02,180
Oh, no, I know.

8637
05:28:02,360 --> 05:28:02,380
I know.

8638
05:28:02,380 --> 05:28:02,860
I know.

8639
05:28:02,860 --> 05:28:03,760
Like, the stream itself...

8640
05:28:03,940 --> 05:28:05,460
Not much was really...

8641
05:28:05,460 --> 05:28:09,200
Like, it was mostly focused on the auction and everything.

8642
05:28:09,600 --> 05:28:15,660
And it was just like hanging out with you guys and just talking about the foundation and the items.

8643
05:28:15,780 --> 05:28:18,120
And just having like a little hangout session with all you guys.

8644
05:28:18,160 --> 05:28:23,600
Getting my forklift simulator on before my actual forklift certification and everything.

8645
05:28:23,820 --> 05:28:26,060
And the fact that we were able to...

8646
05:28:26,060 --> 05:28:26,860
How are you bad at math?

8647
05:28:26,940 --> 05:28:28,260
Because I'm fucking stupid!

8648
05:28:29,280 --> 05:28:30,500
I'm a streamer!

8649
05:28:31,320 --> 05:28:33,420
You think this brain is used on numbers?

8650
05:28:33,940 --> 05:28:36,900
Why do you think I fucking do dumb shit for entertainment?

8651
05:28:40,280 --> 05:28:41,220
That's what you know!

8652
05:28:41,320 --> 05:28:42,600
I have no prospects in math!

8653
05:28:42,940 --> 05:28:47,000
Anyway, as I was saying, back to being like fucking humble and everything.

8654
05:28:52,100 --> 05:28:55,680
Back to being like super humbled and generous.

8655
05:29:03,720 --> 05:29:05,680
As I was saying...

8656
05:29:06,300 --> 05:29:06,580
As I was saying...

8657
05:29:12,360 --> 05:29:16,620
The stream itself, there wasn't really a lot planned for the stream itself.

8658
05:29:16,920 --> 05:29:20,800
I just really wanted to use it to like introduce the auction items.

8659
05:29:20,920 --> 05:29:23,540
I never really planned on doing a very long charity stream.

8660
05:29:23,540 --> 05:29:26,680
Because the full focus was on the auction itself.

8661
05:29:27,140 --> 05:29:28,520
It was really...

8662
05:29:28,520 --> 05:29:30,320
It was an amazing...

8663
05:29:30,320 --> 05:29:33,140
Just to see all you dragoons...

8664
05:29:34,020 --> 05:29:35,520
Just like...

8665
05:29:35,520 --> 05:29:42,060
Working together to raise so much money for such a good cause.

8666
05:29:42,440 --> 05:29:44,940
And being able to...

8667
05:29:44,940 --> 05:29:45,840
And it's still going!

8668
05:29:46,260 --> 05:29:47,520
Oh my god!

8669
05:29:47,660 --> 05:29:50,020
They're fighting over the keyboard again!

8670
05:29:52,240 --> 05:29:53,040
Bro!

8671
05:29:53,040 --> 05:29:54,500
And like, stop!

8672
05:29:54,660 --> 05:29:56,180
And now they're still fighting!

8673
05:30:00,920 --> 05:30:04,760
Trollboy is trying so fucking hard for that keyboard.

8674
05:30:12,000 --> 05:30:14,660
But they woke up!

8675
05:30:15,360 --> 05:30:16,700
A new...

8676
05:30:16,700 --> 05:30:18,940
A new challenger has arrived!

8677
05:30:19,660 --> 05:30:20,500
Cameron!

8678
05:30:21,740 --> 05:30:23,020
Cameron has arrived!

8679
05:30:23,040 --> 05:30:24,220
Cameron has woken up!

8680
05:30:24,220 --> 05:30:25,280
And is ready!

8681
05:30:27,560 --> 05:30:28,000
Alright.

8682
05:30:28,200 --> 05:30:30,100
For those who are new here and wondering what...

8683
05:30:30,100 --> 05:30:32,000
What is everyone fighting about?

8684
05:30:32,220 --> 05:30:32,880
Okay, don't worry.

8685
05:30:32,980 --> 05:30:35,420
I will put the text up for all of you guys.

8686
05:30:35,520 --> 05:30:36,280
For you guys to know.

8687
05:30:36,500 --> 05:30:36,920
Alright.

8688
05:30:38,800 --> 05:30:45,860
If hit 90k, I will play Visage all chapters.

8689
05:30:46,700 --> 05:30:47,700
Alright, here you go.

8690
05:30:50,600 --> 05:30:51,040
Here.

8691
05:30:51,720 --> 05:30:52,320
Doki's scared.

8692
05:30:52,400 --> 05:30:52,840
No I'm not.

8693
05:30:55,060 --> 05:30:55,920
Here we go.

8694
05:30:57,200 --> 05:30:58,080
But only...

8695
05:30:59,080 --> 05:31:00,880
Only if you hit that number.

8696
05:31:00,940 --> 05:31:01,680
Where did the text go?

8697
05:31:02,080 --> 05:31:02,920
Where did it go?

8698
05:31:03,780 --> 05:31:04,440
Where is it?

8699
05:31:04,460 --> 05:31:05,120
Oh here it is.

8700
05:31:05,260 --> 05:31:05,520
Okay.

8701
05:31:06,180 --> 05:31:06,620
Here.

8702
05:31:06,700 --> 05:31:09,300
I will only do it if...

8703
05:31:10,260 --> 05:31:11,600
If I hit 90k.

8704
05:31:11,740 --> 05:31:12,880
I will play Visage...

8705
05:31:12,880 --> 05:31:13,040
No!

8706
05:31:13,260 --> 05:31:14,000
No no no no no!

8707
05:31:14,080 --> 05:31:14,700
We agreed!

8708
05:31:15,800 --> 05:31:17,040
90k or bust!

8709
05:31:17,300 --> 05:31:19,040
I... guys, if I see 85k...

8710
05:31:20,200 --> 05:31:23,020
If I see more 85ks, I'm raising it to 90k.

8711
05:31:23,040 --> 05:31:23,580
95k.

8712
05:31:24,640 --> 05:31:25,780
Don't make me do that!

8713
05:31:26,260 --> 05:31:27,400
I will do it!

8714
05:31:27,820 --> 05:31:30,080
Guys, start playing 90k!

8715
05:31:30,320 --> 05:31:34,100
Or if I see more 85ks, I'm raising it up to 95k.

8716
05:31:34,240 --> 05:31:35,780
You can't do that Doki!

8717
05:31:35,860 --> 05:31:36,420
That's not...

8718
05:31:36,420 --> 05:31:37,100
This is my stream.

8719
05:31:41,320 --> 05:31:43,820
I better see 90ks in my chat!

8720
05:31:44,060 --> 05:31:45,740
Or I'm raising it to 95!

8721
05:31:49,980 --> 05:31:50,940
And that...

8722
05:31:50,940 --> 05:31:53,240
Is how you train your chat.

8723
05:31:56,800 --> 05:31:58,540
That is how...

8724
05:31:58,540 --> 05:32:00,720
You make sure your chat is in line.

8725
05:32:01,320 --> 05:32:02,740
Daniel, thank you for the five...

8726
05:32:02,740 --> 05:32:03,380
gift chips!

8727
05:32:03,740 --> 05:32:04,180
Thank you!

8728
05:32:06,200 --> 05:32:06,800
Okay.

8729
05:32:12,980 --> 05:32:13,580
Cool!

8730
05:32:14,320 --> 05:32:16,700
It's been... I'm really...

8731
05:32:16,700 --> 05:32:18,740
I think the one thing I'm like...

8732
05:32:18,740 --> 05:32:20,920
Super... I'm very excited...

8733
05:32:20,940 --> 05:32:22,700
to do a...

8734
05:32:22,700 --> 05:32:24,400
To do the...

8735
05:32:24,400 --> 05:32:26,080
cover songs with both...

8736
05:32:26,080 --> 05:32:27,500
Ditto and Yuusan.

8737
05:32:27,780 --> 05:32:30,720
I can't believe... I can't believe you guys...

8738
05:32:30,720 --> 05:32:32,220
knew my favorite song was...

8739
05:32:32,220 --> 05:32:33,440
Devshan I've Taken Thee.

8740
05:32:37,020 --> 05:32:38,240
Oh my god!

8741
05:32:38,800 --> 05:32:38,980
I...

8742
05:32:38,980 --> 05:32:42,380
What were the odds that you picked...

8743
05:32:42,380 --> 05:32:44,520
my favorite song...

8744
05:32:44,520 --> 05:32:46,140
for me to do a cover?

8745
05:32:48,840 --> 05:32:50,920
You guys just knew me so well!

8746
05:32:50,920 --> 05:32:51,960
I know!

8747
05:32:52,660 --> 05:32:54,900
You guys just knew me so...

8748
05:32:54,900 --> 05:32:55,780
fucking well!

8749
05:32:56,140 --> 05:32:57,880
It's actually crazy...

8750
05:32:57,880 --> 05:32:59,460
how well you knew...

8751
05:32:59,460 --> 05:33:00,340
like...

8752
05:33:02,000 --> 05:33:04,720
It is crazy how well you just...

8753
05:33:04,720 --> 05:33:05,420
know me guys.

8754
05:33:05,700 --> 05:33:06,100
I'm...

8755
05:33:06,100 --> 05:33:08,340
I'm like... I'm like... wow.

8756
05:33:09,900 --> 05:33:11,480
My true fans.

8757
05:33:12,020 --> 05:33:13,460
My true fans.

8758
05:33:14,120 --> 05:33:14,720
Alright.

8759
05:33:16,640 --> 05:33:18,340
Let me double check something...

8760
05:33:18,340 --> 05:33:19,560
real quick chat.

8761
05:33:20,920 --> 05:33:22,180
Oh my gosh.

8762
05:33:22,240 --> 05:33:24,280
I need to train back my...

8763
05:33:25,240 --> 05:33:26,600
stream stamina though.

8764
05:33:26,880 --> 05:33:28,560
I haven't been able to...

8765
05:33:28,560 --> 05:33:31,020
It's been a while since I streamed for this long in general.

8766
05:33:31,200 --> 05:33:31,620
So...

8767
05:33:32,320 --> 05:33:34,740
I've definitely been like pushing it a lot.

8768
05:33:34,940 --> 05:33:36,860
Because I obviously like I wanna...

8769
05:33:36,860 --> 05:33:39,080
be able to stream long hours...

8770
05:33:39,080 --> 05:33:39,760
for you guys again.

8771
05:33:40,060 --> 05:33:42,900
And be able to do like a lot of like...

8772
05:33:42,900 --> 05:33:44,720
fun things with you guys and plan...

8773
05:33:44,720 --> 05:33:46,680
so many fun events and everything.

8774
05:33:47,500 --> 05:33:48,680
But I wanna say...

8775
05:33:48,680 --> 05:33:50,640

8776
05:33:50,920 --> 05:33:51,160

My management team.

8778
05:33:52,340 --> 05:33:53,860
Mr. Man and Little Man.

8779
05:33:54,100 --> 05:33:57,300

8780
05:33:57,300 --> 05:33:57,760

8781
05:33:58,160 --> 05:33:59,020

05:34:01,460 --> 05:34:02,480
There's so much...

8784
05:34:02,480 --> 05:34:04,560
so much work that they all did.

8785
05:34:04,920 --> 05:34:06,700
So... huge shout out to them.

8786
05:34:06,960 --> 05:34:08,740
Zachary thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

8787
05:34:08,920 --> 05:34:09,240
Thank you!

8788
05:34:09,280 --> 05:34:09,800
Thank you!

8789
05:34:10,840 --> 05:34:12,240
I'm gonna make sure...

8790
05:34:13,380 --> 05:34:15,020
that... I'm gonna make sure...

8791
05:34:15,020 --> 05:34:17,120
that I've done everything...

8792
05:34:17,120 --> 05:34:17,780
on the...

8793
05:34:17,780 --> 05:34:20,360
stretch goals and I didn't...

8794
05:34:20,920 --> 05:34:22,180
put a lot on anything yet.

8795
05:34:22,280 --> 05:34:24,640
I'm just gonna make sure everything is good to go.

8796
05:34:24,920 --> 05:34:26,600
The only thing I need to do...

8797
05:34:26,600 --> 05:34:27,640
is I need to...

8798
05:34:27,640 --> 05:34:31,160
make sure that...

8799
05:34:31,160 --> 05:34:32,620
I post the...

8800
05:34:32,620 --> 05:34:35,160
community post for...

8801
05:34:35,160 --> 05:34:36,620
umm... what is it?

8802
05:34:36,720 --> 05:34:37,320
The voice packs?

8803
05:34:37,640 --> 05:34:38,780
And also the bento.

8804
05:34:39,940 --> 05:34:41,160
So other than that...

8805
05:34:41,160 --> 05:34:42,480
we should be good to go!

8806
05:34:44,400 --> 05:34:46,460
I don't think... no no no no no!

8807
05:34:46,520 --> 05:34:47,480
We did the hot sauce!

8808
05:34:48,060 --> 05:34:49,360
We did the hot sauce!

8809
05:34:50,920 --> 05:34:51,980
You can't gaslight me on that!

8810
05:34:52,100 --> 05:34:53,360
I remember what we did!

8811
05:34:56,800 --> 05:34:58,860
Daddy thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

8812
05:34:59,040 --> 05:34:59,340
Thank you!

8813
05:34:59,340 --> 05:34:59,980
Thank you!

8814
05:35:00,120 --> 05:35:01,440
I really do appreciate it!

8815
05:35:01,480 --> 05:35:02,300
Thank you so much!

8816
05:35:02,480 --> 05:35:04,680
I really do think you guys should all be...

8817
05:35:04,680 --> 05:35:06,260
extremely proud of yourselves.

8818
05:35:06,600 --> 05:35:08,460
To be able to... umm... get together.

8819
05:35:08,880 --> 05:35:11,280
And umm...

8820
05:35:11,280 --> 05:35:12,960
Just... raise...

8821
05:35:12,960 --> 05:35:13,840
so much money!

8822
05:35:14,120 --> 05:35:15,820
So much money for such a...

8823
05:35:15,820 --> 05:35:17,620
such a good cause.

8824
05:35:17,620 --> 05:35:19,080
And I'm just...

8825
05:35:19,080 --> 05:35:21,560
I can't believe the amount of money...

8826
05:35:21,560 --> 05:35:21,880
we raised.

8827
05:35:22,740 --> 05:35:23,300
Umm...

8828
05:35:23,300 --> 05:35:23,980
In general.

8829
05:35:24,200 --> 05:35:25,320
It's just insane.

8830
05:35:25,920 --> 05:35:26,480
Umm...

8831
05:35:29,360 --> 05:35:30,540
What about the giveaway?

8832
05:35:30,740 --> 05:35:31,480
Okay I'm gonna...

8834
05:35:32,920 --> 05:35:35,360

8835
05:35:35,360 --> 05:35:36,380

8836
05:35:36,580 --> 05:35:39,040

05:35:51,940 --> 05:35:52,240
Hahaha!

05:35:56,600 --> 05:35:57,800

8877
05:36:54,290 --> 05:36:55,310
You can't judge me.

8878
05:36:55,450 --> 05:36:56,590
I can judge you guys...

8879
05:36:56,590 --> 05:36:57,910
because you're gonna bark in the replies.

8880
05:36:58,790 --> 05:36:59,190

8881
05:37:01,050 --> 05:37:02,230

8882
05:37:02,450 --> 05:37:02,850
What?

8883
05:37:03,190 --> 05:37:04,150
It is for charity.

8884
05:37:04,270 --> 05:37:05,690
Are you trying to say you guys won't bark for charity?

8885
05:37:06,010 --> 05:37:06,810
That's fucked up.

8886
05:37:07,110 --> 05:37:08,070
That's fucked up chat.

8887
05:37:08,590 --> 05:37:08,990

8898
05:37:27,570 --> 05:37:28,070
Okay.

05:37:29,510 --> 05:37:30,790
Alright we're good.

Alright guys.

8902

8903
05:37:37,930 --> 05:37:38,410
Exactly!

8904
05:37:39,810 --> 05:37:41,130
Derp knows it!

8905
05:37:41,470 --> 05:37:43,430
Derp is willing to howl for charity.

8906
05:37:43,690 --> 05:37:44,950
Be more like Derp.

8907
05:37:47,270 --> 05:37:48,730
Here you go.

8908
05:37:50,550 --> 05:37:51,850
See look at that!

8909
05:37:52,170 --> 05:37:53,690
Instant barks!

8910

Right there!

8911
05:37:55,670 --> 05:37:56,370
Hahaha!

8912
05:37:57,430 --> 05:37:58,010
Hahaha!

8913
05:37:58,830 --> 05:38:02,190
When you judge all these people that barked in the replies...

8914
05:38:02,190 --> 05:38:03,150
instantly...

8915
05:38:04,670 --> 05:38:05,710
Sell out!

8916
05:38:07,050 --> 05:38:07,750
Hahaha!

8917
05:38:08,050 --> 05:38:08,750
Hahaha!

8918
05:38:12,050 --> 05:38:12,570
Hahaha!

8919
05:38:14,840 --> 05:38:15,850
What do you mean?

8920
05:38:16,230 --> 05:38:18,130
I'm not to sell out here.

8921
05:38:18,330 --> 05:38:20,630
I'm not to sell out here.

8922
05:38:20,630 --> 05:38:22,970
Look at yourselves in the mirror.

8923
05:38:23,090 --> 05:38:24,130
Look at...

8924
05:38:24,130 --> 05:38:26,670
Look at yourselves in the mirror.

8925
05:38:26,930 --> 05:38:27,230
Hahaha!

8926
05:38:29,390 --> 05:38:30,130
That's right.

8927
05:38:30,770 --> 05:38:31,510
Look at that.

8928
05:38:31,890 --> 05:38:34,170
256 barks already chat.

8929
05:38:36,150 --> 05:38:37,510
256 barks.

8930
05:38:37,590 --> 05:38:38,550
There you go.

8932
05:38:39,890 --> 05:38:40,430

05:38:56,510 --> 05:38:58,250
60 minus 43.

8941
05:38:58,810 --> 05:38:59,770
17 more minutes.

8942
05:39:00,370 --> 05:39:00,870

8943
05:39:02,070 --> 05:39:03,150
17 more minutes!

8944
05:39:03,510 --> 05:39:05,130
And you guys will get full visage!

8945
05:39:06,030 --> 05:39:07,170
I will change my...

8946
05:39:07,170 --> 05:39:08,990
I'll change my profile picture after the stream.

8947
05:39:09,190 --> 05:39:11,970
Don't worry I know exactly what profile picture to change guys.

8948
05:39:12,270 --> 05:39:14,090
You guys were very...

8949
05:39:14,090 --> 05:39:15,890
adamant about the fucking...

8950
05:39:15,890 --> 05:39:17,230

8951
05:39:17,950 --> 05:39:19,090

8953
05:39:22,050 --> 05:39:22,570
Hahaha!

8954
05:39:24,270 --> 05:39:24,790
Hahaha!

8955
05:39:25,550 --> 05:39:26,590
Do not worry!

8956
05:39:27,050 --> 05:39:27,830
It's there!

8957
05:39:28,730 --> 05:39:30,350
It's there in the twitter replies!

8958
05:39:31,370 --> 05:39:32,330
Do not worry!

8959
05:39:33,210 --> 05:39:34,330
It's so good.

8960
05:39:34,390 --> 05:39:35,230
It's perfect.

8961
05:39:35,810 --> 05:39:37,790
Alright when can I turn it...

8962
05:39:37,790 --> 05:39:39,230
Okay on the 16th.

8963
05:39:39,230 --> 05:39:40,690
I can change it on the 16th.

8964
05:39:40,730 --> 05:39:42,310
Do I have anything professional to do?

8965
05:39:42,390 --> 05:39:42,630
No.

8966
05:39:42,650 --> 05:39:42,930
Okay.

8967
05:39:43,010 --> 05:39:43,710
We are good.

8968
05:39:43,910 --> 05:39:46,670
There is nothing professional to do in the next two weeks.

8969
05:39:46,830 --> 05:39:47,930
So I do not have anything professional to do in the next two weeks.

8970
05:39:47,950 --> 05:39:48,410
I do not have to worry.

8971
05:39:48,630 --> 05:39:50,490
I do not have to worry.

8972
05:39:50,970 --> 05:39:51,270
Hahaha!

8973
05:39:53,710 --> 05:39:54,070
Hahaha!

8974
05:39:54,870 --> 05:39:55,910
It's okay.

8975
05:39:56,310 --> 05:39:58,810
There is nothing to worry about now.

8976
05:39:59,590 --> 05:40:02,010
I wonder if I can actually lower...

8977
05:40:02,010 --> 05:40:02,970
this.

8978
05:40:03,210 --> 05:40:03,470
Okay.

8979
05:40:03,550 --> 05:40:04,230
Let's see.

8980
05:40:04,570 --> 05:40:06,190
It's possible to...

8981
05:40:06,190 --> 05:40:08,470
Oh it is!

8982
05:40:08,910 --> 05:40:09,370
Nice!

8983
05:40:09,870 --> 05:40:10,590
Alright.

8984
05:40:11,470 --> 05:40:13,930
Uh... we are at...

8985
05:40:13,930 --> 05:40:14,390
Alright.

8986
05:40:15,410 --> 05:40:17,110
I'm gonna put this back at...

8987
05:40:17,110 --> 05:40:17,770
No!

8988
05:40:18,230 --> 05:40:19,710
Must be at least equal to your top.

8989
05:40:19,870 --> 05:40:20,250
Oh okay.

8990
05:40:20,350 --> 05:40:21,630
As long as I get rid of the...

8991
05:40:21,630 --> 05:40:22,390
Okay give me a sec guys.

8992
05:40:22,470 --> 05:40:25,110
It's time to do some little...

8993
05:40:25,110 --> 05:40:26,310
Alright we are gonna...

8994
05:40:26,970 --> 05:40:27,850
delete this.

8995
05:40:28,370 --> 05:40:30,890
Cause we are definitely not gonna hit 400k.

8996
05:40:31,410 --> 05:40:31,850
Hahaha!

8997
05:40:32,910 --> 05:40:33,350
Hahaha!

8998
05:40:33,970 --> 05:40:36,610
There is no way we are hitting that.

8999
05:40:37,150 --> 05:40:37,990
That's for sure.

9000
05:40:38,290 --> 05:40:39,590
Alright we are gonna delete this.

9001
05:40:39,870 --> 05:40:41,450
And then we are gonna put this up here.

9002
05:40:41,450 --> 05:40:43,450
I'm just gonna fix this...

9003
05:40:43,450 --> 05:40:44,370
real fast guys.

9004
05:40:45,390 --> 05:40:47,490
And then I think we are at...

9005
05:40:47,490 --> 05:40:48,330
here right?

9006
05:40:49,210 --> 05:40:49,810
Yay!

9007
05:40:50,430 --> 05:40:51,470
We did it!

9008
05:40:51,510 --> 05:40:51,690
Alright.

9009
05:40:52,210 --> 05:40:52,810
Okay.

9010
05:40:54,210 --> 05:40:55,450
Is this all our...

9011
05:40:55,450 --> 05:40:55,810
milestones?

9012
05:40:56,170 --> 05:40:56,390
Okay.

9013
05:40:58,450 --> 05:40:59,670
I'm just gonna fix...

9014
05:40:59,670 --> 05:41:01,430

9015
05:41:01,430 --> 05:41:03,570
our calendar real quick.

9016
05:41:03,810 --> 05:41:05,430
Because I can finally get rid of...

9017
05:41:05,430 --> 05:41:06,430
the 400k goal.

9018
05:41:06,730 --> 05:41:07,210
Hahaha!

9019
05:41:10,030 --> 05:41:11,230
Doki cheater!

05:41:11,950 --> 05:41:13,510
There is no way...

9021
05:41:13,510 --> 05:41:14,730
you are gonna hit Elden Ring!

9022
05:41:15,250 --> 05:41:17,530
Guys there is no negotiating with that!

9023
05:41:19,130 --> 05:41:21,070
There is no more negotiating.

9024
05:41:21,950 --> 05:41:22,830

9025
05:41:22,830 --> 05:41:23,510
Wait what?

05:41:23,750 --> 05:41:25,210
You are not 1.3k away.

9027
05:41:25,330 --> 05:41:26,410
It's 7.7.

9028
05:41:26,470 --> 05:41:27,110
We have agreed.

9029
05:41:27,450 --> 05:41:29,710
We have established that you have...

9030
05:41:29,710 --> 05:41:31,590
You are gonna hit 9k.

9031
05:41:31,890 --> 05:41:32,610

9034
05:41:36,150 --> 05:41:37,770
46 minus 60.

9035
05:41:38,170 --> 05:41:39,430
There is 14...

9036
05:41:39,430 --> 05:41:40,210

9037
05:41:40,610 --> 05:41:41,210
Okay.

9038
05:41:41,450 --> 05:41:43,050

9039
05:41:43,050 --> 05:41:44,050

9040
05:41:44,490 --> 05:41:44,850

Here.

9047
05:41:53,390 --> 05:41:54,630
Just to make sure.

05:41:55,230 --> 05:41:57,050
It's that you have 14...

9049
05:41:57,050 --> 05:41:59,250
minutes left to hit...

9050
05:41:59,250 --> 05:41:59,970
90k.

9051
05:42:00,310 --> 05:42:01,470

9056
05:42:07,450 --> 05:42:08,090
Hahaha!

9062
05:42:14,530 --> 05:42:18,250

This is the only way!

9064

9092
05:43:05,750 --> 05:43:06,090

05:43:12,710 --> 05:43:15,350
This whole system is rigged.

9097
05:43:15,350 --> 05:43:15,670

9098
05:43:16,110 --> 05:43:18,310
Well I'm teaching you a life lesson.

05:43:20,050 --> 05:43:21,490

9101
05:43:21,590 --> 05:43:23,550

05:44:01,530 --> 05:44:02,210
Tempted to dump...

05:48:25,000 --> 05:48:25,400
Do not worry.

9256
05:48:25,580 --> 05:48:27,920
We have the dad stream.

9257
05:48:28,160 --> 05:48:30,160
We have all of that chat.

9258
05:48:30,460 --> 05:48:31,440
The auction.

9259
05:48:32,680 --> 05:48:34,000
The auction money.

9260
05:48:34,600 --> 05:48:37,160
Goes straight into...

9261
05:48:37,160 --> 05:48:38,420
Into the...

9262
05:48:38,860 --> 05:48:39,700
The stretch goals.

9263
05:48:40,020 --> 05:48:42,160
But I'm giving you guys extra incentives now.

9264
05:48:45,590 --> 05:48:47,110
I'm going to give you guys...

9265
05:48:47,110 --> 05:48:48,010
Extra.

9266
05:48:48,010 --> 05:48:49,670
So we already got Brood War.

9267
05:48:49,830 --> 05:48:50,770
We already got Brood War.

9268
05:48:50,950 --> 05:48:52,310
We already got the Dad Stream.

9269
05:48:52,650 --> 05:48:55,710
We already got because we're adding in the Auction money in there.

9270
05:48:55,910 --> 05:48:57,650
So do not worry about that.

9271
05:48:57,850 --> 05:49:05,750
But now if you guys can hit 100k on the Tiltify itself... on the Tiltify...

9272
05:49:06,550 --> 05:49:10,410
you guys will get... will get the Elden Ring Stream.

9273
05:49:12,710 --> 05:49:16,430
Can we... okay if you guys can do it... if you guys can do it...

9274
05:49:16,430 --> 05:49:18,830
I will give you five Main Story Bosses.

9275
05:49:18,870 --> 05:49:22,870
I'll give you guys five Main Story Bosses.

9276
05:49:23,930 --> 05:49:24,610
There.

9277
05:49:24,610 --> 05:49:26,490
We don't have time.

9278
05:49:27,490 --> 05:49:30,530
We don't have... well guys gotta believe in them!

9279
05:49:36,170 --> 05:49:36,850
Wait.

9280
05:49:39,170 --> 05:49:41,810
How many Main Story Bosses does Elden Ring have?

9281
05:49:42,090 --> 05:49:42,830
Wait a minute.

9282
05:49:44,310 --> 05:49:46,410
Elden Ring Main Story...

9283
05:49:46,430 --> 05:49:47,910
Main Story Bosses... oh fuck.

9284
05:49:48,090 --> 05:49:48,250
Okay.

9285
05:49:48,790 --> 05:49:49,190
Okay.

9286
05:49:49,270 --> 05:49:50,650
Thank god there's a lot more than five.

9287
05:49:50,910 --> 05:49:51,310
Okay.

9288
05:49:51,450 --> 05:49:52,310
One, two, three, four.

9289
05:49:52,330 --> 05:49:52,530
Okay.

9290
05:49:53,250 --> 05:49:54,830
Elden Ring every boss in order.

9291
05:49:54,990 --> 05:49:55,210
Okay.

9292
05:49:55,530 --> 05:49:58,170
Let's get one, two, three, four.

9293
05:49:59,170 --> 05:49:59,570
Okay.

9294
05:49:59,670 --> 05:50:00,130
That works.

9295
05:50:00,250 --> 05:50:00,450
Okay.

9296
05:50:01,210 --> 05:50:02,130
That is doable.

9297
05:50:02,430 --> 05:50:03,070
It's... okay.

9298
05:50:04,530 --> 05:50:04,930
Okay.

9299
05:50:05,670 --> 05:50:06,610
That is doable.

9300
05:50:06,610 --> 05:50:06,910
Okay.

9301
05:50:06,970 --> 05:50:07,550
I can do it.

9302
05:50:11,150 --> 05:50:11,950
Oh fuck!

9303
05:50:12,510 --> 05:50:12,910
Guys!

9304
05:50:17,050 --> 05:50:20,370
I like how I was like... I was like, oh I'll do Elden Ring.

9305
05:50:20,450 --> 05:50:21,210
Everyone was like, go!

9306
05:50:21,550 --> 05:50:22,050
Go!

9307
05:50:22,810 --> 05:50:24,630
She's gonna do Elden Ring!

9308
05:50:24,850 --> 05:50:25,190
Go!

9309
05:50:25,370 --> 05:50:25,630
Go!

9310
05:50:25,710 --> 05:50:25,870
Go!

9311
05:50:32,320 --> 05:50:34,240
I was like, Dragons!

9312
05:50:34,320 --> 05:50:35,900
We weathered her down!

9313
05:50:37,160 --> 05:50:38,380
We did it!

9314
05:50:38,480 --> 05:50:41,400
We got everything we wanted, Dragons!

9315
05:50:42,180 --> 05:50:42,700
What?!

9316
05:50:42,700 --> 05:50:46,640
Not... who... who donated 4k?

9317
05:50:47,640 --> 05:50:48,160
4k!

9318
05:50:48,180 --> 05:50:48,560
Who did that?

9319
05:50:49,640 --> 05:50:50,100
NEXE!

9320
05:50:51,020 --> 05:50:51,940
Why?!

9321
05:50:54,660 --> 05:50:57,720
Oh my god!

9322
05:51:00,660 --> 05:51:03,940
NEXE fucking donated 3k!

9323
05:51:05,420 --> 05:51:05,880
Bro!

9324
05:51:09,580 --> 05:51:10,920
Oh my god!

9325
05:51:12,640 --> 05:51:13,440
Oh my god.

9326
05:51:13,480 --> 05:51:13,600
Hey.

9327
05:51:13,780 --> 05:51:14,220
Nice.

9328
05:51:14,380 --> 05:51:14,880
420.

9329
05:51:18,380 --> 05:51:20,780
You fucking mad lads.

9330
05:51:20,800 --> 05:51:21,560
You waited.

9331
05:51:21,640 --> 05:51:24,180
You waited until I offered Elden Ring.

9332
05:51:24,440 --> 05:51:28,100
You guys all fucking waited until you heard Elden Ring.

9333
05:51:28,360 --> 05:51:32,460
You guys strike... you weathered me down.

9334
05:51:41,060 --> 05:51:42,700
Congratulations everybody.

9335
05:51:43,660 --> 05:51:47,780
You all got your Elden Ring and your visage.

9336
05:51:52,350 --> 05:51:58,680
But in the end, we managed to negotiate better.

9337
05:52:04,340 --> 05:52:05,840
Oh my god.

9338
05:52:05,920 --> 05:52:13,120
In the end, we all managed to raise so much money for charity.

9339
05:52:13,320 --> 05:52:16,460
And like honestly, that's what matters the most.

9340
05:52:17,440 --> 05:52:19,120
That's what matters the most.

9341
05:52:19,180 --> 05:52:22,080
I can't believe you guys got it in within 8 minutes.

9342
05:52:22,220 --> 05:52:23,300
Jesus Christ.

9343
05:52:23,760 --> 05:52:26,960
You guys did it within like 6 minutes too.

9344
05:52:27,140 --> 05:52:27,920
Holy shit.

9345
05:52:28,280 --> 05:52:29,420
Oh my god.

9346
05:52:30,760 --> 05:52:31,480
Uh...

9347
05:52:31,480 --> 05:52:32,360
You guys...

9348
05:52:32,460 --> 05:52:33,560
There was like 4... Sorry, not within.

9349
05:52:33,660 --> 05:52:36,860
There was like 4 minutes left and you guys managed to hit 100k.

9350
05:52:37,340 --> 05:52:39,220
Just on Tiltify alone.

9351
05:52:39,460 --> 05:52:40,660
In total...

9352
05:52:42,260 --> 05:52:44,700
If... The auction is still going on.

9353
05:52:45,040 --> 05:52:48,880
So currently, we've raised, including the...

9354
05:52:49,460 --> 05:52:52,940
Including the waiting room charity.

9355
05:52:53,340 --> 05:52:58,500
We raised in total around... I believe almost 200k.

9356
05:52:59,340 --> 05:53:01,580
And I think like that's something we should all be...

9357
05:53:01,580 --> 05:53:02,980
Incredibly proud of.

9358
05:53:03,100 --> 05:53:04,840
To be able to raise...

9359
05:53:05,520 --> 05:53:05,900
Um...

9360
05:53:08,340 --> 05:53:10,320
200k US dollars.

9361
05:53:11,360 --> 05:53:11,740
For...

9362
05:53:13,100 --> 05:53:15,600
For two charity causes.

9363
05:53:15,980 --> 05:53:17,980
Regarding mental health.

9364
05:53:18,160 --> 05:53:20,760
And both awareness and research.

9365
05:53:21,320 --> 05:53:22,220
Thank you everybody!

9366
05:53:22,740 --> 05:53:23,660
Thank you again.

9367
05:53:23,880 --> 05:53:25,140
It is amazing.

9368
05:53:25,580 --> 05:53:27,040
Um... Even like...

9369
05:53:27,040 --> 05:53:29,220
Even though this is only like a 6 hour stream.

9370
05:53:29,220 --> 05:53:31,180
We managed to raise so much money.

9371
05:53:31,400 --> 05:53:32,840
Within just 6 hours.

9372
05:53:33,420 --> 05:53:33,900
And...

9373
05:53:33,900 --> 05:53:35,620
The auction is still going on!

9374
05:53:35,820 --> 05:53:38,420
So maybe we'll be raising even more money in the end.

9375
05:53:38,600 --> 05:53:39,420
Uh... Within...

9376
05:53:39,420 --> 05:53:41,460
Uh... When the other side of the world wakes up.

9377
05:53:41,540 --> 05:53:42,040
For those who...

9378
05:53:42,040 --> 05:53:42,640
If they're still...

9379
05:53:42,640 --> 05:53:44,180
If they want to bid on anything as well.

9380
05:53:44,640 --> 05:53:45,120
So...

9381
05:53:46,060 --> 05:53:46,540
Um...

9382
05:53:46,540 --> 05:53:47,460
Thank you everybody.

9383
05:53:47,820 --> 05:53:50,240
It has been a huge pleasure.

9384
05:53:50,940 --> 05:53:54,600
I'm really happy that this was the very first event that I'm doing for all of you guys.

9385
05:53:55,280 --> 05:53:55,760
Um...

9386
05:53:55,760 --> 05:53:56,540
And...

9387
05:53:56,540 --> 05:53:56,940
Uh...

9388
05:53:56,940 --> 05:53:57,780
For a...

9389
05:53:57,780 --> 05:53:59,280
For such a great cause.

9390
05:54:00,120 --> 05:54:00,740
And...

9391
05:54:00,740 --> 05:54:01,520
Uh...

9392
05:54:01,520 --> 05:54:02,320
And...

9393
05:54:02,320 --> 05:54:02,880
Yes!

9394
05:54:02,980 --> 05:54:04,280
The Tilify will still be open...

9395
05:54:04,280 --> 05:54:07,680
Will still be open until the auction ends.

9396
05:54:07,880 --> 05:54:08,380
So...

9397
05:54:08,380 --> 05:54:09,500
After the auction ends.

9398
05:54:09,540 --> 05:54:10,940
We will calculate everything together.

9399
05:54:11,300 --> 05:54:11,920
Um...

9400
05:54:11,920 --> 05:54:13,100
But thank you everybody!

9401
05:54:13,480 --> 05:54:14,800
I hope you guys...

9402
05:54:14,800 --> 05:54:16,560
A last shout out to all the creators.

9403
05:54:16,780 --> 05:54:18,680
That worked incredibly hard.

9404
05:54:19,540 --> 05:54:20,160
Um...

9405
05:54:20,160 --> 05:54:20,520
Uh...

9406
05:54:20,520 --> 05:54:21,000
With...

9407
05:54:21,000 --> 05:54:22,300
My manager.

9408
05:54:22,820 --> 05:54:23,440
And...

9409
05:54:23,440 --> 05:54:24,040
Mr. Man.

9410
05:54:24,260 --> 05:54:24,840
And Lil Man.

9411
05:54:25,160 --> 05:54:26,640
And getting all the auctions.

9412
05:54:26,840 --> 05:54:27,460
Auctions...

9413
05:54:27,780 --> 05:54:28,240
Um...

9414
05:54:28,240 --> 05:54:28,900
Stuff done.

9415
05:54:29,180 --> 05:54:30,960
As well as...

9416
05:54:30,960 --> 05:54:31,240
Uh...

9417
05:54:31,240 --> 05:54:32,340
Tilify and the foundation.

9418
05:54:32,920 --> 05:54:33,460
For...

9419
05:54:33,460 --> 05:54:33,840
Uh...

9420
05:54:33,840 --> 05:54:34,640
Working with us.

9421
05:54:34,660 --> 05:54:36,820
And giving me access to the auction house.

9422
05:54:37,480 --> 05:54:38,020
And...

9423
05:54:38,020 --> 05:54:39,020
As well as...

9424
05:54:39,020 --> 05:54:40,000
You dragoons!

9425
05:54:40,300 --> 05:54:42,380
Of course we could have done it without you dragoons!

9426
05:54:42,480 --> 05:54:42,840
Guys!

9427
05:54:43,240 --> 05:54:44,580
With a generous heart.

9428
05:54:45,220 --> 05:54:45,760
Um...

9429
05:54:45,760 --> 05:54:46,480
Uh...

9430
05:54:46,480 --> 05:54:47,540
Without your generosity.

9431
05:54:48,120 --> 05:54:48,660
And...

9432
05:54:48,660 --> 05:54:49,300
Your effort.

9433
05:54:49,400 --> 05:54:50,160
And just like...

9434
05:54:50,160 --> 05:54:51,320
Hanging out with me as well.

9435
05:54:51,560 --> 05:54:51,900
Make...

9436
05:54:51,900 --> 05:54:53,160
Letting me be in the stream.

9437
05:54:54,060 --> 05:54:54,880
This long.

9438
05:54:55,180 --> 05:54:55,980
For all of you guys.

9439
05:54:56,240 --> 05:54:57,100
You're all amazing.

9440
05:54:57,100 --> 05:54:57,800
And...

9441
05:54:57,800 --> 05:55:00,280
