00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,930
Um, at like five in the morning, uh,

8
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,410
I ran out of eggs.

9
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:39,910
I had like I had One more egg in my fridge, but expired on August 2nd So I don't think it was it would have been a good idea to you.

10
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,890
I was tempted, but I'm like no your life's already a mess Stokey.

11
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:52,550
I don't I don't think you should try and Try and and and make expired

12
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:27,870
let it hash because I thought I would use it before it expired that was like oh expired August 2nd oh and it's still in the fridge I didn't throw it out yet I'll throw it out whenever it's it's time whenever I feel like it's time it's Just one egg.

13
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,990
It's just...

14
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,850
But yes, I know how, like, yesterday I was like, maybe I'll do Epic Mickey.

15
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,570
Maybe I'll do a white-off.

16
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,270
And then you see that, by the way, my manager made the waiting room because I couldn't stay up for the thumbnail.

17
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,830
For those who don't know, my thumbnail maker is EU.

18
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:03,350
So, uh, she, uh, so like, uh, sometimes I'm not awake when the thumbnail's done.

19
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,470
So then I was like, I can't stay up.

20
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:13,430
So, um, I asked my manager, I was like, can you upload the waiting room for me?

21
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,930
Uh, whenever, whenever the thumbnail's done, and then I can go, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

Okay, but I do have some funny clips to show you guys.

33
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,130
All right, let me see.

34
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,450
Also, I forgot to say why I also think I might have to visit a tempo.

35
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:14,710
Sorry.

36
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,670
Why I have to visit a tempo.

37
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,890
to wash the bad luck.

38
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:27,270
I forgot to say the plane had dessert but the only dessert they had was strawberry ice cream.

39
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,790
And for those who don't know, I am allergic to strawberry.

40
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,270
So I was so sad because I was like, yippee, ice cream!

41
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,110
And then they like gave me strawberry haggendazs.

42
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,630
I was like, do you have anything else?

43
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,790
I'm allergic.

44
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,750
And they're like, oh, we don't, sorry.

45
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,210
And I was like, oh.

46
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,270
Tokyo to Canada flight.

47
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,870
They both had strawberry ice cream.

48
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,950
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

49
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,550
So I was like, no dessert for you, Doki.

50
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,990
And then no dessert.

51
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,530
And it had to be strawberry ice cream.

52
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,110
Of all, like it could have been anything else.

53
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,930
Like, honestly, they could have given me fruit.

54
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,110
And I should be fine.

55
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,730
As long as there's no strawberry.

56
00:10:22,290 --> 00:11:22,710
the fact that the only dessert they had in stock on that plane was fucking strawberry ice cream i i was so disappointed so sad so i was like i was like i can't believe i can't believe this like happened to me i can't believe it also on that plane i realized um i realized that 100 if i was bit by a zombie I will absolutely infect everybody overseas I because I was like the only one that was like sort of you know I was sick you're on the plane and people could like hear me cough and everything I was wearing like a face mask though um you know uh um and everything but I was like coughing and stuff and I was like thinking oh man I think I'd be like one of those infected that would be that would have like got bit and I'd be like I gotta take a plane ride back to Canada.

57
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,430
The doctors there can fix me up.

58
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:33,150
Like, I was like, I don't want to be, I don't want to be sick in this, in this country.

59
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,890
I want to be back home.

60
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,510
I want to, I don't want to be in like a place that I don't live.

61
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,930
I want to be back home.

62
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,030
And if I'm going to die, I'm going to die at home.

63
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,410
Zero.

64
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,150

73
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:44,040

135
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,460
I literally had zero.

136
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,540
Zero damage, too, by the way.

137
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
But zero damage.

138
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,100
Okay.

139
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,060
I'll show you what this looked like.

140
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,060
It's actually really funny what it looks like.

141
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,560
In the outside POV, it's actually pretty funny.

142
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,260
If you do free cam.

143
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,960
Look at this.

144
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,000
Like...

145
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,820
It's like...

146
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,800
It's like a little...

147
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,260
There's like a little chase like look look at how everybody's trying to kill me.

148
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:31,200
I was like, excuse me Like leave me alone And that wasn't Like that wasn't the only instance that like watch this look Like like look at this

149
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,800
Like whoa Hello, I'm still alive.

150
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:48,640
Hello The video music, and then I came back, I was like, hello everybody, I'm alive.

151
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,820
Okay, there was another instance, it was like, um, Wolverine enters the battle.

152
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:05,460
Okay, so there was another instance, I think it was here, I'm pretty sure.

153
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,780
Okay, I'm going to double check if it's this one, because this happened multiple times.

154
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,920
I was like, oh shit, oh, they're alive.

155
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,520
That's fine.

156
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,680
Yeah, there it is.

157
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,320
There it is.

158
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,580
Wait, is this one?

159
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,760
Our cloak was not having a good time, by the way.

160
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,900
Don't mess with the amazing Spider-Man.

161
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,260
Is this where I get chased?

162
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,200
Oh, there we go.

163
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,560
There we go.

164
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
And I was like, goodbye.

165
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,300
Goodbye.

166
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,260
And then... Wait, no, it wasn't this.

167
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,700
It wasn't this.

168
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,760
Where was it?

169
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,200
Where was it that I, like, lived?

170
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,260
God, gross behavior!

171
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,600
There was an instance where, like, I was being chased here.

172
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,460
They were really, they were pretty bad.

173
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,400
But to be fair, I was not supposed to be in this Elo.

174
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,140
To be fair, I was absolutely not supposed to be here.

175
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,560
So, like, it was...

176
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:10,780
Oh, yeah.

177
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,380
There we go.

178
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,700
This is it right here.

179
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:25,960
I was like, sorry cloak and then the spider-man came over So I was like we my people need me and then I was like where the fuck did the Thor came from and then I got solo Upton.

180
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,980
I was like, and he's still chasing me.

181
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:38,110
I was like, I was like, where did the Thor come from?

182
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,690
So I was just like, bro, what the fuck?

183
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,250
And I'm just like, I don't, man, I, I'm not supposed to be in this Elo, man.

184
00:24:50,690 --> 00:25:03,890
I'm like, I'm just like, I playing that game, you realize, like, oh, I, I did not play for a while, but even I knew I wasn't supposed to be here.

185
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,250
Get over here.

186
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,430
Where'd she go?

187
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,830
Yeah.

188
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,790
All right.

189
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,510
All right.

190
00:25:12,430 --> 00:26:09,830
inviting a player to play because I don't want to solo queue despite like how much I love Marvel Rivals rank I just like how much I love rank I don't want to solo queue guys hold on if I have to de-rust so I don't want to be a leader so um oh hello like thank you for the red thank you thank you okay you are the leader all right i'm just waiting for oh wait okay i'll show you guys okay they made this new change they made this new change in the in the game and it's one of the best changes ever and i'll show you what they did okay you guys watching

191
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,510
Now we can wait and...

192
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,930
We can...

193
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,610
Igniting the time.

194
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,710
Why am I not in the lobby?

195
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,630
Oh, there I...

196
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,910
We got a game.

197
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:40,650
Why?

198
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,250
Yes.

199
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,330
So in the waiting screen.

200
00:26:43,630 --> 00:27:14,970
you can put on emotes while you wait no i want what a great thing to join in all right what do i want to play i want to play loki or luna okay we have three dps players but that's fine that's fine this is obviously the most optimal Update they've ever done.

201
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,170
I think that makes this game, like, an 11 out of 10.

202
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,410
Alright.

203
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:25,790
Emma.

204
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,890
Why Emma?

205
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,690
Why not?

206
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:29,670
Torch.

207
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,090
I'm fucking banning Torch next.

208
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,310
Be right back.

209
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,270
Why would you bleach your eyes?

210
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,150
It is a beautiful thing.

211
00:27:41,310 --> 00:28:18,660
You society gave us ask so why not use it why not appreciate the beauty that God gave us he knows venom knows what he has so he is he he's giving us the people what they want what to play I don't know if I don't play it dude I don't play Loki just to get the Lord icon because I'm literally just missing I'm missing I have Lord Icon on Mantis,

212
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,280
Kloog, Invis, and Luna.

213
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,080
I'm just missing it on Loki.

214
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,100
I...

215
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,340
Yeah, this is GM Elo.

216
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,580
So, like, um, shit, Lo.

217
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,860
I'm sorry for your GM.

218
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:37,960
Pick up!

219
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,340
Pick up!

220
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,780
Which support you?

221
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,440
I'm fucking...

222
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,680
I guess I have to play Luna.

223
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,080
I...

224
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,060
Oh my god, we have a Spider-Man.

225
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,420
All right.

226
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,100
I have to warm up.

227
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,360
I haven't not played anything.

228
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,460
I've not played anything.

229
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,280
I didn't want...

230
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,560
I never warm up anyway.

231
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,780
But it's going to be interesting.

232
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,360
GM is way higher than it used to be.

233
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,400
Okay.

234
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,380
I don't know.

235
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,680
For me, I was playing in GM lobbies like yesterday.

236
00:29:16,440 --> 00:30:17,840
like people were a bit messy but I also heard they removed stacking so a lot of people who got boosted by six stacking plus or like not plus but you know what I mean a lot of people that got like heavily carried and stacking for oh my god how do you die okay look okay who like heavily abused it but would only get to like the lower egos like i guess like gm celestia felt hard don't worry i got you okay i have to don't worry i got you oh my my god don't worry i still got you don't worry everybody i'm a healer

237
00:30:21,260 --> 00:31:00,960
okay that's fine it's fine that i missed that um but i know there's like a lot of like super inflated players that are dropping hard right now because they got rid of stacking and yeah because i know like in the past people would six stack to like celestia i want to eat all the guy so like so like and it was so easy to abuse that whoa oh my god that's a combo don't worry i think cloak will oh don't worry i think cloak will Don't worry.

238
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,220
Okay, never mind Oh shit.

239
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,230
Okay, I'm alive.

240
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,740
Hello.

241
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,980
They have a scarlet witch?

242
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,960
I live through one disaster just to have to go through another.

243
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,320
I, okay.

244
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,340
I literally live through like hell.

245
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,180
Get through Scarlet Witch.

246
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,180
That's fucked up.

247
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,660
Also, I think there's Spider-Man.

248
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,240
Don't be toxic, but I think Spider-Man is not a very good player.

249
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,160
Here's the born again.

250
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,440
But I just think, obviously.

251
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,240
Just a theory.

252
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,160
Just a theory.

253
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,740
It's just a theory.

254
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,700
Okay, I just saw that happen.

255
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,920
But it's still just a...

256
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,220
Oh!

257
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,120
Okay, that, okay, why did our cloak not alt?

258
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,340
Why did our cloak not alt?

259
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,480
Cloak, you had four second cooldown!

260
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,240
You had four seconds to peer!

261
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,020
Oh my god, four seconds!

262
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,880
The fucking sound cue was so early!

263
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,440
Like...

264
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,540
Saving it for next game.

265
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,640
Like...

266
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,540
Saving it for next game.

267
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,720
The sound kill- it takes like four seconds to charge that up!

268
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,800
He fucking is saying, like, a fucking novel!

269
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,360
There is a novel going on!

270
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,680
Okay, I don't know if, like, that can kill anything, though.

271
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,380
Please!

272
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:46,880
Please!

273
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:47,700
Oh!

274
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,780
I- Please!

275
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,440
Oh!

276
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,880
No, he did!

277
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,980
It doesn't matter.

278
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,960
It doesn't save me from a fucking nuke.

279
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,520
Never mind.

280
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,380
I can't live through a nuke.

281
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,940
I wonder if she...

282
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,900
Never mind.

283
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,020
Nothing can save me from that.

284
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,940
Already just... I'm having so much fun.

285
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,120
I'm having the time of my life right now.

286
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,580
You're winning though.

287
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,920
Hey guys, I'm winning.

288
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm winning.

289
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,640
It's fine.

290
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,140
Everything is fine.

291
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,240
Can live through a nuke noted.

292
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:45,100
If she alted, you wouldn't panic and walk into the 100% cloak attack is false.

293
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,060
Exactly.

294
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,840
It's never my fault, guys.

295
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,060
No bikini, Luna Snow.

296
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,540
You need to pay real money for that.

297
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,780
I couldn't use my... Wait, actually?

298
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,160
Do I have it?

299
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,200
On the account?

300
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,000
I don't know.

301
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:09,560
Sometimes, I think one time I got a bug where, but like, I think like you need to pay, because you need to buy the Battle Pass or whatever.

302
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,700
So, no, it's a different currency.

303
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:18,560
I have the blue currency, but I don't have the yellow one, because that one requires real money.

309
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,110
Of course it's me.

310
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,430
I...

311
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,570
The hero died like a hero.

312
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,330
Don't worry, I'm coming back.

313
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,590
The hero's coming back.

314
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,570
Please just live.

315
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,430

316
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,810
Oh my god.

317
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,590
There we go.

318
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,570
Don't worry, the hero is here.

319
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,830
I will waste my shift so I don't...

320
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,950
don't have to do more heals.

321
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,980
Jesus Christ, he's just fucking... Oh my God!

322
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,660
Oh my God!

323
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,180
Oh my God!

324
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,020
To be fair, I kept him alive as long as I could there.

325
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,740
That was crazy how long I kept that man alive.

326
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,300
That's actually crazy how oh my God.

327
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,560
Okay, let me stand on my own cloak.

328
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:59,320

329
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,520
I told you.

330
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,940
I would never lie about that.

331
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,020
Jesus Christ.

332
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,620
How many...

333
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,080
Okay.

334
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,080
We still have... We still have point!

335
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,320
We still have point, guys!

336
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:12,940
Let's go!

337
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,160
Let's go!

338
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,800
Come on!

339
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,060
Look!

340
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,560
We... I... I don't... Oh my god, it's fine.

341
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,600
It's fine.

342
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,360
Three, two, one.

343
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,520
There we go.

344
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,280
We're so fine.

345
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,720
That's... Fuck you, I... Fuck you!

346
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,400
Fuck you, it's not as cool now!

347
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,000
Oh!

348
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,540
Oh my god, it's okay.

349
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,640
It's okay.

350
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,980
His sacrifice, I will never forget what he did for us.

351
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,540
Okay, the one freeze I missed, though.

352
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:47,940
The one freeze I missed.

353
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,560
Nice.

354
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,700
We did it!

355
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,260
We won!

356
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,760
We did it!

357
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,580
I hit every single freeze.

358
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,700
for that.

359
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,600
We did it.

360
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,860
That's my hero.

361
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,700
Look, I told you.

362
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,820
I told you I'm a hero.

363
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,600
I told you guys.

364
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,600
I'm a hero.

365
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,520
Look at that.

366
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,860
Okay, the Spider-Man with the AK was not very inspiring.

367
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,580
Not gonna lie.

368
00:38:32,070 --> 00:40:06,930

371

You'll need a top notch team to win this one.

372
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,350
Do you, can you play Luna well?

373
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,570
I could play Luna or I could play Mantis for the team up with Loki.

374
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,330
I wanna be Loki.

375
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,190
Poopy Scoopy, do you want a duo?

376
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,790

378
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,010

Take out Eddie Groot.

384
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,650
Can one of our three DPS swap off?

385
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,570
I mean, I'll put it all.

386
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,290
I know how to play it.

387
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,470
They also have a name more so I don't know how effective dive is going to be.

388
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,350
Then don't fucking play dive!

389
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,990
If you think dive is not in, don't play dive!

390
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,130
Oh.

391
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:27,610
There's like 300 people on us here.

392
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,970
Alright, you know what time it is?

393
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,430
It's time for me to retreat.

394
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:39,910
I'm not looking to be toxic, but I'm about to swap the DPS if we can't get first.

395
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,470
We have a key.

396
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,670
We have a key, I don't know, we have Moon Knight.

397
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,030
We have very little range.

398
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,030
I mean, to be fair, we have Moon Knight, so...

399
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,610
I mean, I have...

400
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,730
Oh,

401
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm fine.

402
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,440
Oh, my God.

403
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,280

411
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,640

Good job, Boopie Scoopie.

418
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,540
Good job.

419
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,680
It all worked out.

420
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,260
I'm going to try to ult on Mantis when she ults.

421
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,880
I'm not the best at Loki, so I like to use it to practice.

422
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,380
Especially if in this Elo, I can practice, I mean, not Loki.

423
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,680
I can practice Loki here.

424
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:31,000
I feel like they're going to soon so I'm gonna try and just in case I'll use it to push up too there you go I have to do that he lives he lives oh my god I didn't okay they're just gonna use Okay.

425
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,560
That's awkward.

426
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,120
He got...

427
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,700
Woofley, can you go tank and let me go DPS please?

428
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,700
I mean, all right, you know what?

429
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,500
Oh, he doesn't know.

430
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,560
Imagine telling...

431
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,570
Telling a...

432
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,540
Imagine a GM player telling a pro player to get off DPS.

433
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,740
That's crazy.

434
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,900
He doesn't know.

435
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,160
Bro!

436
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,060
Bro, my bro, my dude, my dude.

437
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,580
There we go.

438
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,840
We might not live this.

439
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:16,400
We do.

440
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,440
Because I'm just that good.

441
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,300
You're fucked.

442
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,420
That's how you play support, bitch!

443
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,100
The last critical information.

444
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,020
I thought it was Spider-Man.

445
00:47:35,380 --> 00:48:02,340

448
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,980
Why did she jump in?

449
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,640
Loki, you're just sitting in the portal with your alt and...

450
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,780
There was no one to copy.

451
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,680
Alright, cloak jumped in.

452
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,100
And died.

453
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,680
Alright, so let's get a winning cop.

454
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,240
Flying in the air is not gonna work against Punisher.

455
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:38,040
Can we go maybe rocket and... There's no No way.

456
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,160
They're asking for a rock.

457
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:42,960
Now they want.

458
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,580
Like, I was like, how do I copy?

459
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,560
How do I copy?

460
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,080
I was like, where's my cloak?

461
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,720
Where the fuck is my cloak?

462
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,020
Okay, we're going Adam.

463
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,400
We'll do Adam, Luna.

464
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,040
I shine in darkness.

465
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,160
Yeah, I was like, I was not the weak link here.

466
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,560
There's no way.

467
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:03,060
I literally saved us from so many things.

468
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:22,880
I was like, there's no way you're blaming me when I had such good lamps that's actually crazy imagine being like i'm i'm gm but like i'm pretty sure i play better than this pro player like

469
00:50:28,780 --> 00:51:10,440
marvarez was never changed never changed don't worry now i have wait shit wait what i only played okay one you have to stop them from securing the mission area like i'm like what do you mean my all requires me to copy how do i copy when i can't when i can't find people i got bucky too how am i not getting healing okay i was gonna say How am I not feeling any heals there?

470
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,460
Because I'm like, I'm pretty sure all I have to do is just exist in his LOS.

471
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,160
Be careful.

472
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,600
Alright, we raised him.

473
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,020
Okay, that was just a hell-married task, because I hope that...

474
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,480
I was hoping that I would bump into something.

475
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,240
He's pulling.

476
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,300
Shoot.

477
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:32,840
Goodbye.

478
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,560
I had to reload.

479
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,200
If I didn't have to reload, he'd live.

480
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:39,820
If I...

481
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,740
That's actually unfortunate.

482
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,880
Rocket, please!

483
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,720
Puppy!

484
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:47,840
Jump down!

485
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,220
On front, please, please, please, please.

486
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,200
Oh my god.

487
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,860
He literally didn't jump down.

488
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:54,600
I...

489
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,560
Oh my...

490
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,700
Who killed our rocket?

491
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,180
Oh my god, he didn't jump down!

492
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,380
I was looking for one of these.

493
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,840
Oh, sweet.

494
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:26,940
why did he jump down to me i wasn't gonna guys i i think poopily scoopily might be a bad player i don't oh my god okay that's fine that's us

495
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:36,880
okay we delete that here there was double Double Punisher.

496
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,140
There was no way we can live through that.

497
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:45,400
There was no way.

498
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,980
There was no way I was gonna live through that.

499
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,500
With Double Punisher, there was no fucking way.

500
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,440
But his name, at least his name is funny.

501
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,880
You know, at least, you know, at least his name is funny.

502
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,520
But I literally think that is...

503
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,360
We definitely have to avoid somebody.

504
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,420
Maybe the Spider-Man.

505
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,380
Please tell me you have all...

506
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:12,840
What?

507
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,840
Does he not have all?

508
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,520
Uh...

509
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,880
I didn't think he was gonna go there.

510
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,580
Wait, he had all!

511
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,680
It's so difficult for me.

512
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,740
He had all!

513
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,180
It is what it is.

514
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,540
Good try, everyone.

515
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,060
Because I was like...

516
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,780
Just don't understand our picks against three shooters.

517
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,300
We have one diver.

518
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:39,760
Okay.

519
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:41,720
Okay.

520
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,880
I mean, that was me just trolling there.

521
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,080
I...

522
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,200
I...

523
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:46,740
I...

524
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,220
I...

525
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,720
I think this guy's actually 12.

526
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,360
I...

527
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,000
I...

528
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,020
I...

529
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,200
I think this man's actually 12.

530
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,540
I...

531
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,700
Like, too...

532
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,700
I think...

533
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,600
How is he...

534
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,260
Wait, he is!

535
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,000
He's a Lord of Rockies!

536
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,060
Okay, wait.

537
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,880
I need to know who...

538
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,040
Who are you avoiding?

539
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:15,580
Okay.

540
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,840
I need to ask who is avoiding so we can coordinate.

541
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,540
I'm not wasting avoid slots.

542
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,360
Who are you avoiding?

543
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:23,920
Okay.

544
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,380
Avoid!

545
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,360
Snap and Noah, please!

546
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,840
Okay.

547
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:32,900
Avoid.

548
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:34,880
And...

549
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,240
Okay.

550
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,780
Okay, this is as, did you avoid the rocket?

551
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:51,920
Because he, he did so many things.

552
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:26,380

554
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,940
We're on the bad word list.

555
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,500
Can we see...

556
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:46,500

Oh my god, he has it.

He is my Elo right now.

560
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,500
Oh, he is in tears.

561
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:53,460
Alright.

00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,340

You know, he...

565

Wait, he's been hard-stucked GMs since season 1?

566
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,540
I'm so sorry.

567
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,740
792 games played!

568
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:08,820
How?

Seven?

570
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,420
Okay, that was the day he peaked Celestial.

571
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,060
Okay, but...

572
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,920
Oh my god.

573
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,620
That's crazy.

574
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,640
I'm sorry.

575
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,220
That's actually crazy.

Holy shit.

577
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,480
That's crazy.

578
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,220
He's been in this Elo for a long time.

579
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,920
He's been here for a while.

580
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,180
Um...

583
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:26,060
Like, what did you expect from Poopy Scoopy?

584
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:34,060
I was, it was just impressive.

585
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,760
It was very impressive.

586
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,640
Don't be jealous, Doki.

587
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,620
You'll never be good as Poopy.

Not with you.

596
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:57,410
I freeze to kill them all.

597
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:01,630
I want to play Loki.

598
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,770
I want my Lord out, God.

599
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:08,110
Okay, like, people are so, like, it's so fucking dumb.

600
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,570
They're like, oh, oh, why don't you do it?

601
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,790
Because, like, I would play Loki, but then they'll be like, oh, you have Lord on Luna.

602
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:16,990
Why don't you play Luna?

603
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:19,750
I was like, and I'm like, because I want to play Loki.

604
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:25,150
I'm in this elo, it doesn't mean I don't play other support.

605
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:33,330
Like, they just assume just because you don't have a lord icon that you're bad at the support.

606
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:37,930
Okay.

607
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,670
I might need help, though.

608
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:51,290
Oh my god, okay, I have to use this just because, or we die, or, or we die.

609
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,890
Okay, that's fine.

610
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:00,030
We might have used all our support logs, but that's fine.

611
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,070
We can build it, I believe.

612
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:13,640
It's like, they like focus on the fact if you don't have a fucking Lord icon on whatever character you're playing right now, that you're bad at it.

613
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,180
I'm like, so I need a Lord icon on fucking Loki.

614
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,340
Because I got blamed for like not playing Luna.

615
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:28,800
Because they're like, oh my god, have a lord icon on Luna and you don't play Luna?

616
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,220
And I'm like, what the fuck?

617
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,440
I can play any support.

618
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:40,800
Like, it doesn't necessarily mean, like, oh shit, I was not paying attention.

619
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,900
That's bad.

620
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,080
Our rocket ran up.

621
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,140
Okay, do we have... Oh, nice we do.

622
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:58,420
Can we get the... What are... No, we can't.

623
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:03,860
We couldn't.

624
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,980
Yeah, it's literally time today.

625
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,420
Yeah.

626
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,300
So that's why I wanted to fucking get... Did he just alted?

627
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,920
Yeah, I was like, what the fuck is he?

628
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,020
Oh, he still died.

629
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,380
That's awkward.

630
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,820
That's actually pretty awkward, actually.

631
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,560
I don't know how you still die.

632
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,800
Okay, I'm leaving.

633
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,360
Please, please, please, thank you.

634
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,560
Thank you.

635
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,840
It's hard dive.

636
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,240
They're just playing dive.

637
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,420
Oh yeah, they're just playing dive.

638
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:55,690
I have to reload.

639
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:56,810
I have to reload, please.

640
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:58,270
Please.

641
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:03,270
Please, I have to reload.

642
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,030
Please don't die.

643
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:09,450
Please don't die.

644
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:10,710
Please don't die.

645
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,330
I can't reload forever.

646
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:16,970
Oh my god, he jumped.

647
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:17,750
He jumped.

648
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:21,470
If he didn't jump, if he didn't jump, I would have frozen.

649
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:22,810
I'm not coping.

650
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,090
I swear to God.

651
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:29,370
If he didn't jump, I would have hit him.

652
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:37,250
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have like looked at him, looked at blade instead.

653
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:44,010
It's not coping guys, it's not coping.

654
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:48,010
Oh now they're not doing that, okay.

655
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:54,210
Now they're just tanking it.

656
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:57,350
Don't worry, Wooply.

657
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:00,030
Oh my god.

658
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:02,090
That solo oven is insane.

659
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,560
Oh shit.

660
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:08,940
Here we go.

661
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,360
I'm just gonna stay here.

662
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,140
Or a little bit.

663
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,500
And then back up a little bit because I feel like he wants to...

664
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,340
Oh my god, it's just everything.

665
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,100
It's just there's so many things going on my screen.

666
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:24,840
Oh, goodbye.

667
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:26,760
Ah!

668
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:28,620
I'm alive.

669
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,960
I'm not gonna risk it.

670
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,680
Oh shit!

671
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,940
They don't know.

672
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:36,500
They don't know.

673
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:37,160
They don't know.

674
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,660
They don't know the crime I committed there.

675
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:42,720
They don't know, guys.

676
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,620
They don't know.

677
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:44,880
They don't know.

678
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,180
He doesn't know.

679
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,580
He's not gonna watch the recap.

680
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:48,860
He doesn't know.

681
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,460
He doesn't know.

682
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,100
He doesn't know what I did.

683
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,100
Yeah, see, you don't know.

684
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,120
You don't know either.

685
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,780
You don't know.

686
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,200
You don't know what I did because I didn't do anything wrong.

687
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:09,020
I didn't do anything wrong, guys.

688
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:10,080
Absolutely.

689
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,580
See, if you guys don't know, then I'm safe.

690
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,300
You guys didn't realize what I did because I didn't do anything wrong.

691
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,200
That's my logic.

692
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,080
Holy fuck.

693
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,100
What?

694
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,200
What?

695
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,180
That should 100% hit, not gonna lie.

696
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,600
Okay, we're five.

697
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,160
See, we're so healthy!

698
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,180
We're so healthy!

699
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,160
Look at that!

700
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:49,680
He's 1 HP!

701
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:50,580
Look at that!

702
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,220
Look at us, girl!

703
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:54,980
What is he gonna do?

704
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,540
Punch him out of the air?

705
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,200
Like...

706
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,100
Get this guy out of here.

707
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,720
The current score is...

708
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:30,340
is this your third triple no why is this just my main account guys i just haven't played in a while chat i just i just haven't played in a while you'll need a top-notch team to win this one i just like watched that ironfish like punched in the air i'm like what the get down you're not meant to fly get down from here

709
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,160
Where's the Luna?

710
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:37,920
Because I did...

711
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,780
Okay guys, you gotta teach me how to convert it.

712
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:42,460
I literally have zero Luna Snowskins.

713
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:45,400
I have zero Luna Snowskins.

714
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:50,060
Because I just don't like any of the Luna Snowskins.

715
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,880
I just don't like any of the Luna...

716
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,680
The default one's the best one.

717
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,680
And even then, I don't like the color...

718
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,440
I just don't like the hair color for Luna.

719
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,400
In her summer.

720
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:04,620
In her bikini one.

721
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:11,280
I think that her bikini, uh, I don't sound like the hairstyle and the hair color of her bikini outfit.

722
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,480
My favorite anti-air weapon, mom.

723
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:27,770
I think, like, her outfit's good, but the hair color and the hairstyle, I don't like it.

724
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:32,990
People are too busy looking at something else.

725
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,590
They never notice the hair.

726
01:07:36,270 --> 01:08:33,150
though I notice it it has to be a perfect 10 out of 10 skin for me to use it because like okay even though okay I would say Loki Loki has some of the best support skins um I would I feel like because like it's I was so hard to choose between like um his his summer skin or the president one one was is so good as well it's very hard to pick because i find loki has like the better skins overall but okay guys we have to oh my god of course he jumps a fucking course of course they jumped guys please someone shoot the supports maybe maybe that's a good idea

727
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:39,990
Oh my god, okay.

728
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:43,630
He was just punching me.

729
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:45,050
Like, what do I do?

730
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,750
What do you do when he...

731
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:52,570
Oh, that was a little too late, my buddy.

732
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:56,670
I mean, you can burst him.

733
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:59,390
Guys, I was gonna say it.

734
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:00,690
I don't know.

735
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:01,310
I don't like the...

736
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,790
I don't like the dress.

737
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:04,650
I personally don't like it.

738
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:05,450
Oh, wait.

739
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:06,150
They surrendered.

740
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:06,890
Yay!

741
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:16,620
I won by doing nothing at all.

742
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,420
Even though, you know, Loki has, it's crazy.

743
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:31,760
He basically is not wearing any, like, he's like 80% naked, but his...

744
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,900
The summer skin is still pretty good.

745
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,260
Okay, how do I convert my currency, guys?

746
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,640
You guys say I can convert it?

747
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:43,000
Alright, because look how much I have...

749
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,500
It's just two inch big.

750
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,380
Oh, buddy.

751
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,120
It's not the size.

752
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,120
It's not the size.

753
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,520
It's how you use it.

754
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:29,360
It's all.

755
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:30,620
Sorry.

756
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,760
Yes, it is.

757
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,340
It is above average.

758
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,280

If I super chat 50, you get Luna skin.

764
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,480
Yes, no.

765
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:03,800

Oh, I thought he would go left, but he went right!

780
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,620
He's just a little healing.

Poor don't worry, Groot.

785
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,300
Touch them with your two inches.

786
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,680
Very big deal with it.

787
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,720

It's two inches big.

795
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:45,280
Money is sheep thong.

796
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,620

Oh my god, that poor guy.

01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,560
What the fuck?

802
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,920
What are you doing here?

803
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:02,700

804
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,020

Get out of here!

806
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,860
Did he get anybody?

807
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:10,740
He didn't.

808
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:11,720
It's okay.

809
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,460
It's okay.

810
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,180
It's just because it just wasn't...

811
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:16,560
If it was one inch longer, you would have got him, Groot.

812
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,760
I believe in you.

813
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:28,380

01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:38,870
Oh my god.

874
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:42,270
Guys, why did nobody help me?

875
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,150
Oh my god, I'm okay now.

876
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:45,170
Look at that.

877
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,810

01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:48,830
Wow, that's crazy.

01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:51,270

01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:52,830
Oh, I died though.

881
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:55,830
I...

882
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,330
After an hour, we figured it out.

883
01:19:58,830 --> 01:19:59,850
Yeah, it's only me healing.

884
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:31,890

885
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:36,710
Guys, I did it.

886
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:38,570
I did it.

887
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:41,930
I hope he doesn't see.

888
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:45,310
I'm like, oh my god, he saw me from the...

889
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:46,370
Okay, that's me, folks.

890
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:47,310
I didn't realize.

891
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:53,510
Oh my god, why would you ever turn to your left?

892
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:54,710
I didn't...

893
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:55,950
I need to get raised!

894
01:20:57,010 --> 01:21:01,630
That was too far.

895
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:08,130
Guys, I think after turning anti-aliased off, like, it made me worse as a player.

896
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:09,270
I don't know.

897
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:12,170
It might have made me worse as a player, guys.

898
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:19,850
It might have actually got me worse at the game.

899
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:20,670
I don't know how.

900
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:25,830
You know, you would have expected to improve.

901
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:32,980
Oh, a whiz.

902
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,300
Okay, if we...

903
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:36,320
Okay, I have to use this.

904
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,560

01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:17,230
like thinking, have we had anything?

910
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:19,810
Maybe we're just both bad at defense.

911
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,270
Oh my god, where did he come from?

912
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,870
Where did this Emma come from?

913
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:27,430
Okay.

914
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:32,170
Who did all of these people come from?

915
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,370
Holy shit, the Luna died so fast.

916
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:38,210

01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:41,130

01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:45,270
Wait, what this anti-aliased does?

919
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:52,770

01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:27,190
Yeah, I'm just...

923
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:31,450

01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:36,790
Like, I know what, but, like...

926
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:39,610
I feel like some dragoons don't know.

927
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:40,650
Thanks.

928
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:49,610

01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:53,370
Just for the dragoons who might not know.

01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:58,290
I'm gonna back up a little bit.

931
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,990
I don't think I have to ult yet.

932
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,020
Oh no, you belong to her!

933
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,520

934
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,740
Okay.

935
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:15,880
That's fine.

936
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,760
Now know what?

937
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:24,440
Oh my god.

938
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:25,940
Oh thank god, okay.

939
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,720
I was like, don't look at me.

940
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,640
Okay, mine's gonna end before hers.

941
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,900
Oh my god, she's body blocking me!

942
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,720
Holy shit!

943
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,720
Okay, I don't know if you noticed, but I couldn't move because she was...

944
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,940
I think we were both body blocking each other, so she couldn't move either.

945
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,320
Our overasses were too big.

946
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,840
We were both body blocking each other there.

947
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,280
Or a thick booty.

948
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:02,660
I was trying to leave.

949
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,480
I told you.

950
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,700
I told you.

951
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,680
The hair color is so ugly.

952
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,260
The hairstyle and I don't like the hairstyle and the hair color.

953
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,500
It's just a double combo.

954
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:23,860
If it was one, if it was just one of the things, then it's fine, but it's both of them that I'm not a fan of.

955
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,440
Holy shit!

956
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,980
Where did anyone get the license plate?

957
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:36,900
Like, I literally came out of the invisible wall!

958
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:45,680
What?

959
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,940
Okay, I might die if I look at them too long, so I'm gonna wait.

960
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,260
I am Groot.

961
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,800
Please go to the right side where majority of us is.

962
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:06,500
I would really appreciate that.

963
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:12,280
I hope he can kill him before he kills me.

964
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:19,370
Oh that's bad.

965
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:20,770
That's bad.

966
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:23,470
That's very bad.

967
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:46,750

968
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:50,570
Okay, that portal was a little not inspiring.

969
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:53,110
That portal...

970
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:57,810
That portal was a bit too crazy, you know?

971
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:02,030
Okay.

972
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:04,650
Oh my, the stall.

973
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:05,530
What the fuck?

974
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:06,970
We stalled for so long.

975
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:07,970
Holy shit.

976
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:12,140
Okay.

977
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:13,780
That's fine, we live.

978
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,320
I live.

979
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,740
Oh my god, someone save her.

980
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,680
Don't worry, we got this.

981
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:27,780
We can do this.

982
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:29,040
We can survive.

983
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:33,040
Don't worry, I got you.

984
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,820
You're not dying on my watch.

985
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,380
That's for your wife.

986
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,960
Oh my god, I'm dead.

01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:13,690
I'm dead.

994
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:14,290

1001
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,460
There's nothing I could do.

1002
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,200
There was nothing I could do.

1003
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:32,670
Yo, there's actually no way.

1004
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,840
Spider-Man, can you please let me DPS, bro?

1005

Just please, please.

1006
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:46,900
I was maybe, maybe, um, hot guy and Spider-Man was not it.

1007
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:47,860
Just a...

1008
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,840
He's like, no, it's not me.

1009
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:57,160
The other guy's like, I'm not the problem.

1010
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:03,360
It's the support's fault for not healing me.

1011
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,480
I'm not the problem.

1012
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,700
That's unlucky.

1013
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,520
28-17 is crazy.

1014
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,380
Please don't sell this.

1015
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,420
Hope it wasn't hindering too much that I was lagging.

1016
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,860
My skin suit was lagging, guys.

1017
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:43,620
I hope it wasn't hindering the stream too much, guys.

1018
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:53,110
Okay, don't worry, it's fine.

1019
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:53,770
That's good.

1020
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:54,750
We should know.

1021
01:30:58,090 --> 01:30:59,770
Oh, Renkis says GM too.

1022
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:03,570
I might stop when I get to Celeste deal, maybe.

1023
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:04,230
I don't know.

1024
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:05,870
I don't know how I feel.

1025
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:08,690
I like how I feel.

1026
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:10,890
I like how many always tried to throw snowballs with me though.

1027
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:18,230
I like how Booply is using the heal function so our Ironman just gets just a little extra heals.

1028
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:19,370
You know?

1029
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:21,530
Just that one little extra heals.

1030
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:26,090
Alright.

1031
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:27,030
Alright.

1032
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:28,990
What the fuck?

1033
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:30,310
Someone kill this door!

1034
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:31,590
Someone!

1035
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:33,850
Don't break his shins!

1036
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,890
Wait, I hear like, rocket, not rocket thing.

1037
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:40,730
Where's our item?

1038
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:42,930
I need to, like, save him.

1039
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:45,170

Oh my god!

1042
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:53,200
This is real firepower!

1043
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:57,510
Oh my god, I have to reload.

1044
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:10,230
I don't have I actually I don't have a so that See guys, it's not the Iron Man's fault.

1045
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:11,430
It was the support

1046
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:19,050
You guys need to let me keep you guys you need to let me keep you doing fine.

1047

Was a big booty, Latina, showing off her curves?

1056
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:20,130
I can see the cake right now.

1057
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:21,110
I can literally see it.

1058
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:24,570
Yes, I want to.

1059
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:28,470

1061
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:34,510
What the fuck is this?

1062
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:38,950
If we lose this, I'm finding all your addresses.

1063
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:40,710
I'm...

1064
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:43,330
Oh, Joe!

1065
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:47,370

1066
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:52,270
Oh, Joe!

1067
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:54,910
What do I do?

1068
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:59,390
I have the real questions.

1069
01:33:59,570 --> 01:34:01,030
What can those two inches do?

1070
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:04,490
What do you mean?

1071
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:05,710
I mean nothing.

1072
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:10,090
They get dubs, that's what it does.

1073
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:13,570
Oh, that's a good one.

1074
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:14,330
Oh, I'm steamy dubs.

1075
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:16,550
Oh, I'm steamy.

1076
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:22,250
Damn, this is what my rival rivals does to a person.

1077
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:26,590
This is why we keep voice chat on.

1078
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:29,150
Guys, this is exactly why.

1079
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:33,290
They won.

1080
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,970
This is exactly why.

1081
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:39,850
What the hell?

1082
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:41,910
It's called MyVarivals.

1083
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:46,800
You hear that?

1084
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:48,500
Two inches go crazy, guys.

1085
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:51,940
From Mr. Is 2-inch big himself.

1086
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,180
It does a lot to a person.

1087
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:56,900
It does.

1088
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,040
It really does.

1089
01:34:59,700 --> 01:34:59,920
Wait.

1090
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,120
His history?

1091
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:02,200
Okay.

1092
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:05,960
That means I should absolutely check his history.

1093
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:09,900
This guy?

1094
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:10,880
Okay.

1095
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:13,800
Oh.

1096
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,220
Oh, I don't think he's okay.

1097
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:23,370
I don't think he was okay.

1098
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:25,590
I'm seeing it like that.

1099
01:35:31,590 --> 01:36:00,850

I got a BP player, by the way.

1101
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:05,870
You won above all players.

1102
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:07,290
No way we lose these, right?

1103
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:08,150
Who's the other one?

1104
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:09,710
I don't know how to even select all three, though.

1105
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:11,490
But you didn't know it was me.

1106
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:13,950
Do you guys use trackers?

1107
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:15,490
Is this how you're seeing this?

1108
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:18,410
Oh, you're peak, yeah.

1109
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,210
I mean, MPP, but...

1110
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:22,530
Why are you using trackers, man?

1111
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:24,830
I don't want to go against BP.

1112
01:36:26,010 --> 01:36:27,730
Wait, he uses trackers?

1113
01:36:30,530 --> 01:37:21,330
they use third party trackers to figure out like um like even you hide your stuff the third party trackers can see your information my go south lock but ptock's much more is there yeah there's like third party trackers so they know who to ban so they look at i look is easier to do third party trackers make it so that you can know who to ban because it shows like who you're like it shows like what their mains are and everything no yeah that was like a pure so they could target bad going through my veins when you said that have you not like yeah but you can't ban it there's no way to actually ban it no like he would kill both supports in less than a second yeah i would assume that yeah what was your what was your backline tell me uh i think we were a low-key cloak That's why you're fucking dying.

1114
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:22,690
You're going Loki cloaking against BP.

1115
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:24,230
Why are you playing Loki cloaking against BP?

1116
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:25,590
Loki's anti-dive?

1117
01:37:26,490 --> 01:37:26,930
No!

1118
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:28,230
At least no!

1119
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:30,290
He gets two-shotted!

1120
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:32,010
One of the best anti-dive supports.

1121
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:34,470
I think I might know more.

1122
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:37,410
I think I might know a little bit more about what's better against BP.

1123
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:40,670
I'm against a BP.

1124
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:46,430
I'm probably going Loki or cloak or... I mean, not... I would go invis, but I don't like it.

1125
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:48,730
No, go Luna Sue, and it's... You're done.

1126
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:49,590
You're just OP.

1127
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:52,450
You press right click, you sit next to the shield, boom, you're done.

1128
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:58,750
Oh, yeah, but yo, there's the immortality fields that are so cool.

1129
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:01,890
And they make it so, and then guess what happens when they're after it, right?

1130
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:05,730
He comes back in, two shots are Loki, boom, you're done.

1131
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:06,150
Nah.

1132
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:13,650
He just went, he just went, nah.

1133
01:38:14,590 --> 01:38:19,410
After like all the explanation, he's just like, nah, he's rage baiting.

1134
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:21,190
He doesn't actually do the heal.

1135
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:24,410
It's not his fault.

1136
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:28,450
He's actually rage baiting.

1137
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:29,070
That's crazy.

1138
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:30,550
Oh my god.

1139
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:33,770
He actually just walked into that.

1140
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:38,390
Oh my gosh.

1141
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:41,870
Oh my god, my thing is...

1142
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:43,350
My thing already got deleted.

1143
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:44,290
That's crazy.

1144
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:47,410
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

1145
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:51,150
What the fuck?

1146
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:52,450
He's so far away.

1147
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:53,410
You're free.

1148
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:55,630
Actually free.

1149
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,390
Okay, that's fine.

1150
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:01,470
Go look back!

1151
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:02,050
It's okay!

1152
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:03,310
I don't matter.

1153
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:04,210
Why are we going Punisher?

1154
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:05,970
Oh, I got that.

1155
01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:07,270
No.

1156
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:09,450
Okay, I'm sorry.

1157
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:10,490
I need to stop talking.

1158
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:13,670
He's just like, no!

1159
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:16,330
No!

1160
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:34,590
It's just straight up That's fine I've really fucking takes forever to build a lot Just come over come over here.

1161
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:35,750
Oh shit.

1162
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:45,690
I didn't even get it I'm scared I don't even have luck Not building all in time.

1163
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:56,450
Yeah, I'm not building it in time actually a curse I don't have my I don't have my ult in time okay

1164
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:16,690
okay I'm softening off Loki I'm not build my my tanks died too fast for me to build all right also like Loki's oh my god he dies too fast for me to build it

1165
01:40:20,530 --> 01:40:23,510
Okay, maybe I could do something.

1166
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:26,050
Maybe...

1167
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:27,970
Maybe...

1168
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:29,890
There you go.

1169
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:39,190
There was nothing I could do.

1170
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:41,670
Alright, I have to play Luna.

1171
01:40:43,190 --> 01:40:44,510
I have to play... Our...

1172
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:48,650
Our thing is not...

1173
01:40:48,650 --> 01:40:51,750
Our thing just really wants to die.

1174
01:40:55,210 --> 01:41:04,150
He's feeding like a fucking crazy easy Okay, I am severely confused about this team comp.

1175
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:21,830
So we had Thor thing moon night and now you're on cloak I mean, I feel like heals are a big issue there I wasn't getting healed in front of both heals and our tanks are just not No, just have no front line Thor is useless and thing doesn't have a good second tank to be able to be enabled.

1176
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:22,550
Why?

1177
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:27,640
Not get heals.

1178
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,860
I was healing you.

1179
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:32,140
I'm just getting dittled.

1180
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:33,460
No, no, the heals are fine.

1181
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:34,380
We just have no further.

1182
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:34,660
What is it?

1183
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:37,280
It's time.

1184
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,140
Useless ass Thor, number one.

1185
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:42,300
And then you can't do anything because he doesn't have like a mag or anything else.

1186
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:43,680
Don't worry.

1187
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:46,920
If we're going triple support, it's time.

1188
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:49,940
Well, in that case, it's time.

1189
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,020
This is the only reason to go triple support.

1190
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,520
There's no reason to go do that.

1191
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:57,180
to do this.

1192
01:41:59,680 --> 01:41:59,760
Alright.

1193
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:02,080
It's time!

1194
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:04,940
I haven't played Ultron in a very long time!

1195
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:06,180
But it's time!

1196
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:08,620
It's time!

1197
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,160
I haven't played this character in so long, but it's time!

1198
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:17,800
It'll be fine.

1199
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,600
It'll be so fine.

1200
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,200
I hope they're...

1201
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:33,160
To be fair, I needed to...

1202
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:33,420
Please.

1203
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:34,980
Thank you.

1204
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:38,620
All right, there you go.

1205
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:41,820
You have to do the stupid diamond thing when you're flying.

1206
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:48,520
But it's time!

1207
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,260
Oh, he fell down.

1208
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,640
Whoops, I should not...

1209
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:54,280
That's because I floated down.

1210
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,660
I wasn't paying it.

1211
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:57,300
I didn't realize he was going to do that.

1212
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,600
Where the fuck are...

1213
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,260
Where are people fighting?

1214
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,100
Where are people fighting?

1215
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,060
I'm so confused.

1216
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:13,280
I'm trying.

1217
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:19,260
There we go.

1218
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:23,540
I'm doing it.

1219
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:26,640
I'm doing it.

1220
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:30,040
Oh, okay.

1221
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:32,540
That fucking sucks.

1222
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:37,820
That's fine.

1223
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,140
It's fine.

1224
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,680
Oh, it's not fine.

1225
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,580
It's okay, we have this.

1226
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,020
There we go.

1227
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,220
It's not fine now.

1228
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,580
He's not gonna throw it up, right?

1229
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:58,520
He's not.

1230
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:00,360
Okay, he didn't throw it up.

1231
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:01,020
Thank God.

1232
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:03,620
There you go.

1233
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,740
I had it on her.

1234
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:10,540
I had it on her.

1235
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:11,520
There was nothing I could do.

1236
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:12,820
There was nothing I could do.

1237
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:13,820
I had it on her.

1238
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:17,380
Like, there was nothing I could do.

1239
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:19,700
I gave all my resources.

1240
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:25,300
That's fine.

1241
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,680
We got it at 85.

1242
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,240
That's something, right?

1243
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:31,980
Oh yeah, no.

1244
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,420
I need to remember the fear.

1245
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,460
It's been so long, I forgot to fear.

1246
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:37,980
It's been...

1247
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:40,960
It's been so long, I forgot what fear was like.

1248
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:43,480
Don't worry, luckily I remember.

1249
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:49,040
Okay.

1250
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:53,340
Okay.

1251
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,080
Get the atom?

1252
01:44:59,300 --> 01:44:59,900
Yep.

1253
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:05,720
Oh my god.

1254
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,820
Oh my really?

1255
01:45:12,430 --> 01:45:15,330
Oh my god, how did everybody die?

1256
01:45:19,690 --> 01:45:21,290
Oh my god.

1257
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:24,550
I don't know how my supports...

1258
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:26,410
I don't know how... I thought they were together.

1259
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:34,470
I don't know, both were some other two supports died.

1260
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:40,350
They should be like babysitting each other, but they weren't.

1261
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:44,550
I was like, guys, guys, we're support players.

1262
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:46,850
We gotta babysit each other, guys.

1263
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:49,850
We gotta keep each other healthy.

1264
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:52,430
It is a team effort.

1265
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:56,090
We had...

1266
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:58,090
Oh no, not born again.

1267
01:45:58,610 --> 01:46:00,010
Wait, where is it?

1268
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:02,770
Oh my god, it's too all right.

1269
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:04,670
That's where it was.

1270
01:46:06,690 --> 01:46:08,690
Oh, that's fine.

1271
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:13,110
I'm fearing, but it's okay.

1272
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:17,490
Because it's okay.

1273
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:20,800
Uh, get near me.

1274
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:25,110
Get near me.

1275
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:26,890
We don't need us.

1276
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:29,670
We don't need it.

1277
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:32,210
Please kill him.

1278
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:34,710
Uh, get...

1279
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:35,570
Okay, we...

1280
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:35,990
Okay!

1281
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:36,570
Why?

1282
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:37,370
Okay.

1283
01:46:37,810 --> 01:46:37,970
We.

1284
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:39,990
Oh, why did he?

1285
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:41,030
Why?

1286
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:42,650
Why?

1287
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:45,610
Why?

1288
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:52,530
That's fine.

1289
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:53,350
Okay.

1290
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:53,990
You know what?

1291
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:54,290
It's fine.

1292
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:57,370
We could have saved that.

1293
01:47:00,910 --> 01:47:01,710
I...

1294
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:03,470
But we're sad.

1295
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:06,010
Like, there was...

1296
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:06,050
There was...

1297
01:47:06,070 --> 01:47:16,610
literally they didn't even came in we could have saved that for when they came in i was like why are you doing that

1298
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:42,300
i just fly he need yeah he needs clips i was just like bro like just wait literally wait five seconds it would have been fine that's gm you move with such stealth might stop i'm just i'm gonna Celestio, because then matches, matches improve, because a lot of the,

1299
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:45,580
a lot of good players are in Celestia at the moment.

1300
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:48,540
I mean, eternity ends Celestio, but you know.

1301
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:56,720
I think, like, Diamond 1 to Celestio in just two days, I think that's a good progress.

1302
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:59,080
I think that's a good progress.

1303
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:02,500
I haven't played, does it, is it noticeable?

1304
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,420
I haven't played Ultra in a while?

1305
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:04,260
I don't know what I'm doing.

1306
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:09,560
I, no, I usually never I am the one that plays Ultron.

1307
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:13,420
Usually I'm not the one that has the honor of playing Ultron.

1308
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:17,820
Because everyone else...

1309
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:20,460
Everyone else gets to play Ultron.

1310
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:22,860
Because all the other DPS players play Ultron.

1311
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:25,060
You know?

1312
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,960
Oh, fuck it.

1313
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:32,460
Oh.

1314
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:37,020
Oh my gosh, that's unlucky.

1315
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:38,920
That's unlucky.

1316
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:40,140
Hey, they're linked.

1317
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:44,740
Oh, are you serious?

1318
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:46,720
I even... that's unlucky too.

1319
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,040
That's not fair.

1320
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:55,420
Focus on him.

1321
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:07,230
Okay, it's fine.

1322
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:09,150
Everything is fine.

1323
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:13,630
Yes, get on point guys.

1324
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:23,650
Oh, never mind Don't worry Are you serious?

1325
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:24,550
Oh my

1326
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:36,850
Jesus Christ I could control us I can't be there forever

1327
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:44,300
Guys, I've been alive for so long.

1328
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:49,460
I built another all I built another all this That's how long I've been alive for.

1329
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,080
I've been alive for so long.

1330
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:53,400
I...

1331
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:58,740
The fact that I got another ult out of all that.

1332
01:49:58,900 --> 01:49:59,800
That was crazy.

1333
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:04,400
That's how long I was alive for.

1334
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,560
Oh, like, I'll go at him after I will.

1335
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:16,500
Oh, my God.

1336
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:17,920
That's huge.

1337
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:19,200
That's huge.

1338
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:19,880
That's actually huge.

1339
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,340
Oh, at least he didn't get slammed.

1340
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:25,720
That's good.

1341
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,900
Focus on the mad, sis!

1342
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:31,480
Nice.

1343
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:37,260
Okay, I don't know about that though, but that's fine.

1344
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,260
Oh, that's unlucky.

1345
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:41,940
This is gonna be the stall of the fucking century.

1346
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,300
To who?

1347
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:43,800
Me?

1348
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,620
He like... Okay.

1349
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:46,740
Okay.

1350
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:48,320
It was to me.

1351
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:52,840
Nice.

1352
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:55,740
There you go.

1353
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:58,320
Oh my god.

1354
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,040
Actual stall.

1355
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,340
They stall for so long.

1356
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:07,180
Jesus Christ.

1357
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:08,940
Jesus Christ.

1358
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,580
Jesus Christ.

1359
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:12,260
Alright.

1360
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:14,540
Oh my god.

1361
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,760
I have to actually shoot my gun.

1362
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:21,740
Wait, that's huge, that's huge.

1363
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:26,720
Oh, I'm fucking trying to keep you up, buddy.

1364
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:28,360
Please.

1365
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:29,620
Oh!

1366
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,640
How mighty also I have to build!

1367
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:39,950
Holy shit!

1368
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:40,530
How many heals?

1369
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:42,630
So many heals.

1370
01:51:43,070 --> 01:51:44,310
So many heals.

1371
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:48,510
It is actually crazy how many heals I was doing.

1372
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:49,590
Bitch.

1373
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:57,090
Jesus Christ.

1374
01:51:57,450 --> 01:51:57,610
Okay.

1375
01:51:58,310 --> 01:51:58,750
I don't know.

1376
01:51:58,950 --> 01:51:59,610
Do I play?

1377
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:01,590
I feel like I play Adam.

1378
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:03,350
I'm gonna play Adam.

1379
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:05,450
Where are I, Luna?

1380
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:08,190
I think, I think it's the play.

1381
01:52:14,930 --> 01:52:16,910
Oh, that's unlucky.

1382
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:22,530
Oh, that's very unlucky.

1383
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:25,250
That's very unlucky.

1384
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:27,510
Our support's ran in.

1385
01:52:31,170 --> 01:52:34,750
Our support's ran in to the point of...

1386
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:38,350
I did this for my Luna.

1387
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:39,970
I'm gonna grab one, right?

1388
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:43,410
That's so unlucky.

1389
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:47,490
I use both snaps.

1390
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:48,190
No, that's bad.

1391
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:50,190
Oh,

1392
01:52:54,190 --> 01:52:54,910
I don't have.

1393
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:56,690
I hope he lives.

1394
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:01,430
It's fine.

1395
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:02,230
Why me?

1396
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:04,250
Why am I the one getting snowflake?

1397
01:53:04,510 --> 01:53:08,270
I'm literally...

1398
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:09,890
I don't know why.

1399
01:53:10,110 --> 01:53:13,210
I don't know

1400
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:16,600
why.

1401
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:17,140
It's me.

1402
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:20,540
It's the only one I could do.

1403
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:24,540
Yeah, this is clearly...

1404
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:25,900
I can't do anything else.

1405
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:29,120
There's nothing else I could do.

1406
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:34,340
Oh my god.

1407
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:39,400
Oh, that was the clone.

1408
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:47,140
Oh my...

1409
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,000
Oh my god.

1410
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:52,740
We win?

1411
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:53,440
I hate you, Thor.

1412
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:54,020
I hate you.

1413
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,860
We made this game 10 times harder now to be.

1414
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,680
I literally am clenching my ass because of how close these games are.

1415
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,060
It's not supposed to be this hard.

1416
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,640
Your character fucking sucks.

1417
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:03,800
You can play something else.

1418
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:04,720
You're not special.

1419
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,060
You're literally not special at all.

1420
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:06,600
You're not out.

1421
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:09,880
Whoa.

1422
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:14,820

1428
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:06,080
He asks us, oh, that, oh, my God, that's not my profile, by the way.

1429
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:06,860
Mine's not like that.

Don't worry.

1434
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:20,460
Oh, I think, I think Wooply is avoiding people.

1435
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,060
uh

1436
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:47,320

All right, it's time.

1451
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:01,600
Oh, let me grab my...

1452
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:02,200
Okay.

1453
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:03,740
Thing.

1454
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:35,880

1455
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:42,380
Yeah, but he doesn't have the right emotes.

1456
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:43,960
That's the thing.

1457
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:45,300
Yeah, sure.

1458
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:46,360

But where's my twerk?

1460
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,600
The twerk should be applied to every character.

1461
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:53,240
All the male characters, though.

1462
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:58,860
The women should have the throwing money and the male characters should have the twerking.

1463
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:00,700
Okay.

1464
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:02,500

01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:40,260
Okay, let me see.

1467
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:42,260
Okay.

1468
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:44,520
Oh, that one.

1469
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:45,460
The monkey one.

1470
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:47,900
Okay, we'll make him sit on the chair, I guess.

1471
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:48,380
Well,

1472
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:53,220
okay.

1473
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:55,060
Change.

1474
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,420
Oh, we'll just make him sit on the chair.

1475
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:02,780
There we go.

1476
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:04,040
Not the chair.

1477
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:24,880
share because it let you know it's there's all right start the queue yeah the thought nice here's the thought here you go i mean like when he sits down you can sort of like the rock

1478
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:50,810
read the what does the book say the other thing oh it says the other thing there you go why does he it's a rock he's made of rocks okay i'm just thinking like can you just put pebbles down there like you know

1479
02:00:54,530 --> 02:01:01,770
what if you just put pebbles down there to pack it you know he's a rock

1480
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:08,430
Don't keep, please.

1481
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:10,950
He's a rock.

1482
02:01:11,130 --> 02:01:12,010
That's all I'll say.

1483
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:12,850
He's a rock.

1484
02:01:18,030 --> 02:01:19,590
I'm just sad he has no ass.

1485
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:20,530
You know?

1486
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:23,510
Like, it's so flat.

1487
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:24,590
Look at this.

1488
02:01:26,150 --> 02:01:30,430
Like, I guess, like, I guess he doesn't need it, but still.

1489
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:32,750
He should.

1490
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:42,900
Why does it have to be so blank?

1491
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,480
Because then it'd be weird if it's...

1492
02:01:44,500 --> 02:02:01,520
like if it was like soft because then like you know people will be like wait why he'll be like wait a minute aren't you made of rock that's why you don't use normal padding you use like you use pebbles or rocks or something

1493
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:09,220
I said you enough for the whole thing

1494
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:18,840
no he said he said I I remember hearing the thing.

1495
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:20,640
Get the thing song.

1496
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:33,060
That was not a scam.

1497
02:02:45,690 --> 02:02:47,590
The art of the deal.

1498
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:50,330
Now look.

1499
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:53,690
I put on the song.

1500
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:55,090
For the thing.

1501
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:57,510
Sorry, I realized that sounded weird off contest.

1502
02:02:57,710 --> 02:02:59,390
So I have to say for the thing.

1503
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:01,190
For the thing.

1504
02:03:03,130 --> 02:03:05,530
The thing put on the sign!

1505
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:12,510
For the thing!

1506
02:03:13,930 --> 02:03:15,730
What map is this?

1507
02:03:16,970 --> 02:03:17,730
Oh, we're defending.

1508
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:18,470
Okay.

1509
02:03:20,830 --> 02:03:21,910
Tingus pingus.

1510
02:03:22,330 --> 02:03:22,870
Why the fuck?

1511
02:03:23,090 --> 02:03:25,090
Why are everybody's names so funny today?

1512
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:27,190
Everybody has such creative names.

1513
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:36,980
Okay, guys.

1514
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:40,700
Okay, guys.

1515
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:45,480
How desperate are you for the Luna skin?

1516
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:52,780
Show me, show me, like, a fight for it.

1517
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,240
I want to see the dedication.

1518
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:00,180
How desperate.

1519
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:03,940
Not really.

1520
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:10,920
Okay, remember this, guys, we don't get the Luna skin because of fluffy dolphin.

1521
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,900
All because of this one person.

1522
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:16,940
Uh...

1523
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:20,400
The one person that I decided speaks for all of you.

1524
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:28,600
I figured, because he clearly speaks for all of you, right?

1525
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:30,500
Why?

1526
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:32,000
Or...

1527
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,080
Okay, I...

1528
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:35,060
I was gonna sit.

1529
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:37,000
Um, please!

1530
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:37,980
Please!

1531
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,540
Baby!

1532
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:41,760
Okay.

1533
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:48,680
Jesus Christ.

1534
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:52,720
I, there's no way I should play low key with a rocket.

1535
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:55,880
It's like, dumb.

1536
02:04:57,880 --> 02:04:58,140
Wait.

1537
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:01,640
Fluffy, thank you for the secret.

1538
02:05:02,140 --> 02:05:03,180
Oh, you regret that?

1539
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:06,900
Fluffy's like, wait a minute.

1540
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:08,020
I was joking, guys.

1541
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:10,060
It was just a he-he-he-he guy.

1542
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:11,860
I was joking, please.

1543
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:13,560
Okay.

1544
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:19,800
I'll do this just in case.

1545
02:05:20,020 --> 02:05:20,780
I'm worried.

1546
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:23,940
I want to do double rise too.

1547
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:30,860
There you go.

1548
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,820
I had to because I already used my up.

1549
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:35,860
Yeah.

1550
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:39,360
I am ready to put on a show.

1551
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:44,500
Judge, jury, executioner!

1552
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,220
Okay, um, he's dead.

1553
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:53,000
There's...

1554
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Yeah, I need a swap.

1555
02:05:54,820 --> 02:05:55,440
There's nothing.

1556
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:57,420
Loki is not the play here.

1557
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,040
Because I have Rocket.

1558
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,820
Like, how the fuck am I gonna do?

1559
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:04,360
Like, Rocket is such a weird-ass copy.

1560
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:09,000
Wait, actually, I should play Loki for the clones here.

1561
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:11,400
I am accused of loving chaos.

1562
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:12,320
Is this true?

1563
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:13,300
I am barely harmed.

1564
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:15,960
What a slide guard you are.

1565
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:18,360
There you go.

1566
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:21,000
There you go.

1567
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:27,300
I had to, like, thank god Ashley played the key here.

1568
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:29,160
That actually was clutch.

1569
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:31,040
That was Ashley so clutch.

1570
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:33,980
Oh my, free fun!

1571
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:38,200
Okay.

1572
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:49,560
Jesus Christ.

1573
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:51,920
Loki is so stressful sometimes.

1574
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:00,340
All right.

1575
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:02,300
He belongs to her.

1576
02:07:07,210 --> 02:07:07,750
Where's Rocket?

1577
02:07:12,050 --> 02:07:13,750
Oh my god.

1578
02:07:14,270 --> 02:07:14,490
Live!

1579
02:07:15,090 --> 02:07:15,090
Live!

1580
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:15,490
Live!

1581
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:17,030
Oh, I saved them!

1582
02:07:17,050 --> 02:07:17,910
I'm a hero!

1583
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:20,190
Oh, I'm a hero!

1584
02:07:20,690 --> 02:07:21,950
I'm actually a hero.

1585
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:54,670
hero i'm actually a hero i don't know what to do about that though i'm like i don't okay um i don't know i'll use it for myself though i like i shouldn't have spammed that shift okay i can't do anything about that i can't do it I couldn't do anything about that though.

1586
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:57,090
I don't know if we could touch.

1587
02:07:57,770 --> 02:07:58,090
All right.

1588
02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:00,450
Now I play Luna.

1589
02:08:02,450 --> 02:08:05,550
I spammed shift so I couldn't do anything.

1590
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:09,190
We're switching.

1591
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:13,790
I don't even know who he's telling him to switch for.

1592
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:25,910
It's just harder to play Loki with the rocket alt as the copy.

1593
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:30,410
It's better if it's like Luna or the coffee.

1594
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,860
I don't think magic is working, though, to be fair.

1595
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:43,600
Yeah!

1596
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:47,100
Not yet.

1597
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:48,780
Where's my rocket?

1598
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:50,120
Where's my...

1599
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:50,900
Did my...

1600
02:08:50,900 --> 02:08:51,120
Oh!

1601
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:52,380
He's so stupid.

1602
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:53,480
He's...

1603
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:55,320
Oh my god, he's so stupid.

1604
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:57,200
We just needed a stack.

1605
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:58,640
If we...

1606
02:08:58,640 --> 02:08:59,940
Oh my god.

1607
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:02,580
This is the rocket player that doesn't try.

1608
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:03,620
their other support.

1609
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:09,500
Because, like, you're supposed to stack where your other support and then heal each other.

1610
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:11,920
We had to heal each other through it.

1611
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:13,580
Instead, he just left me to die.

1612
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:14,340
That's so fucked up.

1613
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:16,120
That's actually so fucked up.

1614
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:17,360
Like, is he dumb?

1615
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:19,760
Yeah, he lived.

1616
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:22,300
But we could have three people living.

1617
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:25,460
Like, three of us could have lived.

1618
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:30,140
That's why I was like, oh my god, he's so stupid.

1619
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:32,260
I'm not gonna use anything yet.

1620
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:33,240
We don't have to.

1621
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:34,120
Yeah, I do.

1622
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:36,940
I have to...

1623
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:38,320
Oh my gosh, he's so neat.

1624
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:40,340
Nice.

1625
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:43,140
Or he's gonna have Punisher Alt, though.

1626
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:46,080
I know this has Punisher Alt.

1627
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:49,720
He's gonna have...

1628
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:53,620
We have Moon Knight Magic as our fucking DPS lineup.

1629
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:54,320
What?

1630
02:09:56,460 --> 02:09:57,240
That's fine.

1631
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:58,800
That's fine.

1632
02:09:59,220 --> 02:09:59,820
That's fine.

1633
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,460
We win this fight, though.

1634
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:06,080
Oh, I thought the shield was going to get off soon here.

1635
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:07,520
It's okay.

1636
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:10,580
Forgive Fluffy of their sins.

1637
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:12,440
They went led astray.

1638
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:17,740
Fluffy, is that true?

1639
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:19,260
Do we forgive?

1640
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:22,500
Are we supposed to forgive you, Fluffy?

1641
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:23,880
Is this true?

1642
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:28,240
Real magic.

1643
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:30,500
I've not seen magic players in so long.

1644
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:31,100
Let's be fair.

1645
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:32,480
I think they might TP.

1646
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:47,340
unless they oh no they they cancel TP because there was supposed to be a TP here nope there is I think I'm dead

1647
02:10:53,500 --> 02:11:08,300
how did two people die like why did we why did we push up we knew they had TP why did we push up oh my god what a throw I don't understand.

1648
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:11,060
It was so obvious, too.

1649
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:15,360
It wasn't like there was not gonna be a TP.

1650
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:23,060
Okay, this is a very fucking weird ass.

1651
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:27,260
Okay, yes, I'm pretty sure he's getting close to us.

1652
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:28,920
I'm gonna be careful here.

1653
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:32,460
Oh my god.

1654
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:34,880
The raccoon was next to me.

1655
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:35,960
I am ready to...

1656
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:39,220
Oh, my God.

1657
02:11:39,820 --> 02:11:43,820
If the raccoon didn't fucking stand next to me, it would have been fine.

1658
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:47,620
He literally stood next to me, so I couldn't do anything.

1659
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:51,980
Oh, my God.

1660
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:53,360
Did he shoot him?

1661
02:11:53,620 --> 02:11:54,680
Did he shoot him?

1662
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,200
Because I shot him.

1663
02:11:56,740 --> 02:11:58,600
I felt like it took him so long to die.

1664
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:02,980
Did he shoot him?

1665
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:04,040
Oh, my God.

1666
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:10,750
shoot the iron man like i swear to god if he shot him we would have both lived

1667
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:17,520
i mean it's smart we literally

1668
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:36,800
okay this is fine rocket did in fact i'm gonna watch the replay i need to know if he shot him then like i'd be like okay it's fine it's it's it's not fine but it's fine.

1669
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:37,520
Oh my gosh.

1670
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:38,220
Okay.

1671
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:48,310
Nice.

1672
02:12:49,010 --> 02:12:49,530
Oh my god.

1673
02:12:49,690 --> 02:12:50,050
That was huge.

1674
02:12:50,250 --> 02:12:50,670
That was huge.

1675
02:12:51,190 --> 02:12:52,470
Our Mac knows how to fucking pay.

1676
02:12:53,310 --> 02:12:53,950
Our Mac knows.

1677
02:12:55,470 --> 02:12:56,170
He knows.

1678
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:57,950
He actually knows.

1679
02:12:58,070 --> 02:12:59,050
He knows how to game.

1680
02:12:59,910 --> 02:13:00,590
Okay, one last fight.

1681
02:13:00,710 --> 02:13:01,970
We have a raccoon.

1682
02:13:04,290 --> 02:13:04,970
That's right.

1683
02:13:05,770 --> 02:13:07,110
I'll keep slandering him.

1684
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:11,050
He doesn't deserve any rights because he's an animal.

1685
02:13:11,630 --> 02:13:14,250
He's not even a real raccoon anyway.

1686
02:13:15,930 --> 02:13:17,790
I don't know if he'll live.

1687
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:20,690
Oh, he doesn't even touch.

1688
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:25,110
He's an abomination!

1689
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:28,230
Not even a real raccoon!

1690
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:31,430
He's a genetic freak!

1691
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:33,450
That's right, I said it.

1692
02:13:33,650 --> 02:13:35,190
He was grown in a lab!

1693
02:13:37,510 --> 02:13:42,650
He was grown and I fucking love!

1694
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:46,950
Yeah!

1695
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:55,790
That's messed up.

1696
02:13:57,070 --> 02:13:58,570
He ain't right, that one.

1697
02:13:59,010 --> 02:13:59,910
That one ain't right.

1698
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:04,870
I've seen this.

1699
02:14:04,910 --> 02:14:05,710
This is a classic.

1700
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:07,170
This is a classic.

1701
02:14:07,670 --> 02:14:08,610
This is a new stream.

1702
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:11,090
I cut it in a real one.

1703
02:14:12,210 --> 02:14:13,710
Chikada, thank you for the super chat.

1704
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:14,090
Thank you.

1705
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:14,870
Thank you.

1706
02:14:15,550 --> 02:14:17,690
I cried in the third movie.

1707
02:14:18,070 --> 02:14:19,050
How could you?

1708
02:14:19,330 --> 02:14:20,290
And I cheered.

1709
02:14:22,450 --> 02:14:24,030
Guys, I swear to God, I'm not a sociopath.

1710
02:14:24,950 --> 02:14:28,530
I swear to God, it's just, I don't know, it's just raccoons, man.

1711
02:14:29,190 --> 02:14:31,110
Not even a real fucking raccoon.

1712
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:31,950
That's the worst part.

1713
02:14:31,990 --> 02:14:33,870
He's not even a real fucking raccoon.

1714
02:14:34,070 --> 02:14:35,650
He was growing in the goddamn lab.

1715
02:14:42,210 --> 02:14:48,450
all the guardians movies that one ain't right

1716
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:07,720

Gomez did not LOS.

1721
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:56,900
There you go.

1722
02:15:58,420 --> 02:15:59,240
That's not on me.

1723
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:02,160
That was a lack of LOS right there.

1724
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:08,020
Okay, he is getting heavily pocketed.

1725
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:09,020
Please, please, please, please.

1726
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:10,400

1727
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:11,660
There you go.

Thanks so much.

1730
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,480
I am ready to put on a show.

1731
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:18,360
Jesus.

1732
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:22,000
Mutant gun.

1733
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:26,260
Aw, I even damaged the truce in it too.

1734
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:29,540
Okay, please, please.

1735
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:32,360
Oh, the oh, no!

1736
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:37,560
I don't know.

1737
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:42,720
I feel it.

1738
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:46,520
For survivability, I might actually have to play low key.

1739
02:16:48,700 --> 02:17:08,760
have I'll do it just for survivability I think like oh yeah no our DPS yeah no our DPS sucks one of them is definitely not performing I'll say that one of us is one of our DPS is not doing so well for sure

1740
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:22,610
There we go.

1741
02:17:24,450 --> 02:17:26,690
Oh, I was gonna say, how did he die?

1742
02:17:27,690 --> 02:17:30,230
I was so confused.

1743
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:32,230
I was like, wait, he's dead?

1744
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:34,290
Please.

1745
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:37,650
Please live so I can...

1746
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:39,250
Please live.

1747
02:17:40,870 --> 02:17:41,690
I have to reload.

1748
02:17:42,350 --> 02:17:42,670
Please live.

1749
02:17:44,570 --> 02:17:45,950
I have to reload.

1750
02:17:46,410 --> 02:17:49,590
I have to reload.

1751
02:17:52,450 --> 02:17:53,250
That's good.

1752
02:17:54,450 --> 02:17:55,990
That's not good.

1753
02:17:59,610 --> 02:18:00,210
Yay!

1754
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:02,010
Phoenix!

1755
02:18:03,730 --> 02:18:04,010
Yay!

1756
02:18:04,010 --> 02:18:04,030
Nice.

1757
02:18:04,330 --> 02:18:04,590
Alright.

1758
02:18:05,430 --> 02:18:05,850
We're good.

1759
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:08,170
Everything is okay.

1760
02:18:08,550 --> 02:18:11,790
I need to check how many more playtime I need for the Lloyd icon.

1761
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:15,550
Yay!

1762
02:18:16,110 --> 02:18:17,070
I'm Phoenix!

1763
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:21,490
Re-racunos, by the way.

1764
02:18:21,650 --> 02:18:26,510
Yeah, and I still have more assist, bitch.

1765
02:18:34,220 --> 02:18:35,980
Jesus, friend.

1766
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:43,320
Just in case.

1767
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:45,340
Just in case.

1768
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:48,660
Don't worry, guys.

1769
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:50,620
Don't worry.

1770
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:54,360
We're doing it.

1771
02:18:54,980 --> 02:18:56,180
You are just...

1772
02:18:56,180 --> 02:18:56,260
You are just...

1773
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:57,920
I have many faces.

1774
02:18:58,360 --> 02:18:58,900
Where's that?

1775
02:19:00,180 --> 02:19:00,360
Where?

1776
02:19:01,620 --> 02:19:01,740
Where?

1777
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:02,200
Oh!

1778
02:19:04,900 --> 02:19:06,980
I was like, where is it?

1779
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:11,200
I hear you are nothing.

1780
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:12,960
I'm like, where's the up?

1781
02:19:14,060 --> 02:19:14,980
Where is the up?

1782
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:18,220
Where did the up go?

1783
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:19,820
I was so confused.

1784
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:22,780
True.

1785
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:25,800
Yeah, I was like, I heard it.

1786
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:27,480
Where is it?

1787
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:29,640
I am ready to put on a show.

1788
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:31,360
So many of us.

1789
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:34,040
So many of us.

1790
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:36,500
This is a non-stop fight.

1791
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:40,340
Okay, that's not my fault.

1792
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:45,200
I literally am doing my best I could.

1793
02:19:46,300 --> 02:19:47,200
There we go.

1794
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:50,300
Just stand there for a sec.

1795
02:19:50,580 --> 02:19:52,560
And then...

1796
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:53,640
And then we wait.

1797
02:19:56,460 --> 02:20:00,560
Okay, I'm a little scared top-peaked, though.

1798
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:06,200
Like, I don't feel safe, guys.

1799
02:20:07,060 --> 02:20:07,560
Oh, nice.

1800
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:07,880
Fear.

1801
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:11,180
I actually, I don't feel safe.

1802
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:12,460
Oh, I'm feeling- I'm safe now.

1803
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:13,480
Yay!

1804
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:16,720
I feel safe now.

1805
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:18,520
Oh, my god.

1806
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:20,180
It's fine.

1807
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:20,760
You can't touch.

1808
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:23,880
I'm alright.

1809
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:25,800
Oh, shit.

1810
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:26,820
I should have healed.

1811
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:30,440
Alright.

1812
02:20:32,420 --> 02:20:34,940
Where did she go?

1813
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:39,300
I was like, bro, she disappeared.

1814
02:20:39,580 --> 02:20:40,780
Where did my Phoenix go?

1815
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:42,440
I got confused.

1816
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:44,220
Okay, I hope our rock yields first.

1817
02:20:45,720 --> 02:20:46,640
And then I'll- After.

1818
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,040
I have to use that.

1819
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:51,140
What the fuck?

1820
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:52,820
My lamp disappeared so fast.

1821
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:54,300
I am Phoenix!

1822
02:20:57,620 --> 02:20:58,420
Yay!

1823
02:21:00,820 --> 02:21:02,820
Don't let anything stay in your way.

1824
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:03,700
Final score.

1825
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:04,780
We did it!

1826
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:07,120
Still more assist.

1827
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,280
You might have more healing.

1828
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:11,140
Still more assist.

1829
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:14,140
Assist matters more.

1830
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:17,140
Because that means I help get kills.

1831
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:23,440
That's what it means, guys.

1832
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:58,000

1833
02:21:58,080 --> 02:21:58,960
Don't talk to me.

1834
02:21:59,180 --> 02:22:01,800
That guy was not inspirational at all.

1835
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:06,500
That guy was... Oh, yeah.

1836
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:07,620
I have to watch the replay.

1837
02:22:07,780 --> 02:22:08,560
I need to know.

1838
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:10,920
Did you shoot at the Iron Man?

1839
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:12,320
Who added me?

1840
02:22:13,620 --> 02:22:14,120
What the fuck?

1841
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:17,540
I don't know who you guys are.

1842
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:18,260
Alright.

1843
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:21,120
Okay, I need to see.

1844
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:21,920
I need to know.

1845
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:22,880
Did they shoot?

1846
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:24,980
I'll buy the Luna skin after.

1847
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:26,260
This is more important.

1848
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,220
right now.

1849
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:28,880
I need a note.

1850
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:30,080
Did you shoot?

1851
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:33,180
Okay, where did he get?

1852
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:37,880
Okay, this is Team B claim the checkpoint.

1853
02:22:38,660 --> 02:22:41,160
Okay, it was right here.

1854
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:42,520
Alright.

1855
02:22:45,180 --> 02:22:46,360
Okay, he shot.

1856
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:47,340
Okay, okay.

1857
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:48,420
He shot.

1858
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:48,920
Alright.

1859
02:22:49,660 --> 02:22:50,720
All is forgiven.

1860
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:51,980
Okay.

1861
02:22:54,740 --> 02:22:56,260
I take back everything I said.

1862
02:22:56,280 --> 02:22:58,620
about this particular raccoon player.

1863
02:22:59,380 --> 02:23:04,360
Just this one, though.

1864

I just.

1907
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:37,800
Okay.

1908
02:26:37,980 --> 02:26:39,500
After this game.

1909
02:26:41,380 --> 02:26:42,420
I'll buy it.

1910
02:26:47,450 --> 02:26:47,890
Okay.

1911
02:26:48,110 --> 02:26:48,970
After this game.

I'll buy it.

1913
02:26:50,390 --> 02:26:51,710
Because I think after this game.

1914
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:52,810

02:26:52,990 --> 02:26:53,690

02:26:56,650 --> 02:26:58,570
It'll have be the level up, guys.

1918
02:26:58,570 --> 02:27:00,030
It'll be the level up, chat.

1919
02:27:00,130 --> 02:27:01,150
After this game.

1920
02:27:03,350 --> 02:27:30,150
where you can level it up oh yeah i want to check the low key proficiency oh my god it's gonna take me fucking forever all right i still it's gonna take i'm not close at all yes i'm not i feel like i feel like i need like i need like um play this for like maybe one more day to actually get the

1921
02:27:33,370 --> 02:27:37,730
healing require i mean i'm almost there but it's like a long way to go

1922
02:27:41,530 --> 02:28:28,470
um it's like 100 yeah this is a long way to go i'm not even halfway bro loki's fucking requirements are so dumb what the i feel like loki is harder to build up because like this is easy to get this is easy like freeze 20 yeah this is easy like 20 enemies freeze 20 enemies and Loki is like create a hundred and eighty illusions like what is that okay this is fine like what the fuck a hundred and eighty it's easy to freeze 20 people then fucking create a hundred and eighty illusions I I don't even think you can get like like what yeah just send them out yeah Yeah,

1923
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:30,510
that's insane.

1924
02:28:30,750 --> 02:28:32,550
Look, I got Cloak and Dagger one.

1925
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:33,650
What is it?

1926
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,630
Where's Cloak and Dagger?

1927
02:28:35,730 --> 02:28:36,410
Where is she?

1928
02:28:36,930 --> 02:28:37,830
There she is.

1929
02:28:39,970 --> 02:28:41,110
This is easy.

1930
02:28:41,810 --> 02:28:42,470
This is easy.

1931
02:28:42,690 --> 02:28:46,330
Because, like, 80 KOs and Assist, you get that, you get this.

1932
02:28:46,870 --> 02:28:50,950
You get a lot of this from just her ult, like, Assist.

1933
02:28:55,870 --> 02:28:57,090
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

1934
02:28:57,150 --> 02:28:57,730
Thank you, thank you.

1935
02:28:57,790 --> 02:28:58,290
Keep on.

1936
02:28:58,290 --> 02:28:59,250
Thank you for the super chat.

1937
02:28:59,310 --> 02:28:59,870
Thank you, thank you.

1938
02:28:59,970 --> 02:29:01,810
I have five dollars!

1939
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:07,970
All right.

1940
02:29:09,230 --> 02:29:13,590
I am Loki, god of mischief, and the king of discard.

1941
02:29:14,910 --> 02:29:17,230
God damn it, I guess it's not.

1942
02:29:18,610 --> 02:29:20,430
I don't want a copy raccoon!

1943
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:25,370
Let me- I was gonna- I almost banned Torch.

1944
02:29:25,730 --> 02:29:26,310
I don't know.

1945
02:29:27,630 --> 02:29:29,490
I don't fucking know, Scylla.

1946
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:30,930
Wolf?

1947
02:29:31,430 --> 02:29:31,970
We don't even...

1948
02:29:32,970 --> 02:29:34,030
I don't guess.

1949
02:29:38,910 --> 02:29:39,510
Hmm.

1950
02:29:41,490 --> 02:29:42,550
That's fine.

1951
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:47,200
Okay.

1952
02:29:47,440 --> 02:29:48,480
I mean, they ban Torch.

1953
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:49,880
I guess I'll ban Seidog.

1954
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:51,800
I don't know.

1955
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:53,760
Because Wooply can play Seidog.

1956
02:29:56,300 --> 02:29:56,900
Phoenix?

1957
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:57,380
Fine.

1958
02:29:57,720 --> 02:30:00,120
Phoenix is actually pretty bad in higher yellow.

1959
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:03,820
But like, in this yellow nobody bans Phoenix for some reason.

1960
02:30:09,270 --> 02:30:11,430
Never leave Luna jail.

1961
02:30:13,590 --> 02:30:14,090
This is...

1962
02:30:14,090 --> 02:30:15,410
Wait, is this...

1963
02:30:15,410 --> 02:30:18,710
I think this is a good Loki map, too, right?

1964
02:30:19,850 --> 02:30:20,370
I'll remember.

1965
02:30:20,730 --> 02:30:23,670
Of course his name is the Raccoon Player's Buck Woofer.

1966
02:30:24,850 --> 02:30:25,970
Of course it is.

1967
02:30:37,630 --> 02:30:38,190
What?

1968
02:30:38,270 --> 02:30:39,790
Which one is bad to deal with?

1969
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:40,970
Or bad as a character?

1970
02:30:42,210 --> 02:30:42,770
Raccoon?

1971
02:30:43,210 --> 02:30:43,790
Yeah, no.

1972
02:30:44,070 --> 02:30:44,350
Raccoon's...

1973
02:30:44,370 --> 02:30:45,450
Ugh, fine.

1974
02:30:45,610 --> 02:30:47,370
They're like, go back to Luna.

1975
02:30:48,210 --> 02:30:49,470
I'm like, but I don't wanna.

1976
02:30:53,550 --> 02:30:54,830
I don't wanna.

1977
02:30:54,970 --> 02:30:57,230
I don't wanna.

1978
02:30:59,410 --> 02:31:02,950
I want my Loki Lloyd.

1979
02:31:03,570 --> 02:31:03,930
Wha.

1980
02:31:05,130 --> 02:31:08,250
Oh yeah, by the way, the new...

1981
02:31:09,450 --> 02:31:11,890
I main DPS, but when I...

1982
02:31:11,890 --> 02:31:14,290
Why would a DPS main play Rocket?

1983
02:31:14,370 --> 02:31:24,250
Out of all the support characters, why would you, if you're a DPS player, like, wouldn't you want to play a character that's more required aim?

1984
02:31:25,250 --> 02:31:29,270
Um, like, that doesn't make sense.

1985
02:31:29,970 --> 02:31:33,370
Why would you play the character that requires the least amount of aim?

1986
02:31:34,250 --> 02:31:35,990
You don't even pew pew gun!

1987
02:31:36,590 --> 02:31:39,870
You don't, you don't need, there's no positioning too.

1988
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:43,430
You're literally, like, I don't know, this doesn't make sense.

1989
02:31:45,670 --> 02:31:49,410
Like, I understand if you're like, oh my god, he's dead.

1990
02:31:52,130 --> 02:31:52,670
Oh, it's dive.

1991
02:31:55,710 --> 02:31:56,590
It's dive.

1992
02:31:57,510 --> 02:31:58,070
Look at that.

1993
02:31:58,390 --> 02:32:01,290
Look at that sick-ass freeze I did, though.

1994
02:32:03,150 --> 02:32:03,750
That...

1995
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:08,010
Yeah, there's a fucking Iron Fist that's ready to fuck me up.

1996
02:32:09,570 --> 02:32:10,470
Right here.

1997
02:32:11,630 --> 02:32:12,530
Right here.

1998
02:32:12,690 --> 02:32:13,270
I knew it.

1999
02:32:14,370 --> 02:32:42,430

02:32:46,030 --> 02:32:51,750

2001
02:32:55,900 --> 02:33:02,260

02:33:23,960 --> 02:33:25,800

Jesus, guys!

2006
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:36,800
You're taking so much damage.

2007
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:37,700
Whoops.

2008
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:49,060
Oh my god, we're fucked!

2009
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:50,640
We're so dead.

2010
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:53,760
We're so dead.

2011
02:33:55,740 --> 02:33:56,520
We're so dead.

2012
02:33:57,820 --> 02:33:59,380
Okay, I don't know, guys.

2013
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:00,840
I think this is GG's.

2014
02:34:01,020 --> 02:34:02,200
I'm not...

2015
02:34:02,300 --> 02:34:04,440
Yeah, our rocket...

2016
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:05,720
Oh my...

2017
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:08,600
Our rocket died so fast.

2018
02:34:13,540 --> 02:34:14,240
That's...

2019
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:15,380
That's like, sad.

2020
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:18,180
Guys, I don't think we're winning this.

2021
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:19,700
I think we're actually gonna get full health.

2022
02:34:20,060 --> 02:34:20,340
Guys!

2023
02:34:22,620 --> 02:34:24,480
This seems like a...

2024
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:25,180
Wait, why?

2025
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:26,740
Why?

2026
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,260
There's no...

2027
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:31,420
Holy shit!

2028
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:34,000
I'm so confused.

2029
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:35,800
I'm so confused.

2030
02:34:36,620 --> 02:34:37,800
Why are we all to that?

2031
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:42,660
Yeah, I mean, like, what do I do?

2032
02:34:46,710 --> 02:34:47,910
Yeah, this...

2033
02:34:47,910 --> 02:34:49,630
This might be...

2034
02:34:49,630 --> 02:34:51,190
This might be GG.

2035
02:34:52,250 --> 02:34:56,570
This might be a little bit GG, guys.

2036
02:34:56,810 --> 02:34:58,070
Just a little bit.

2037
02:34:59,390 --> 02:35:00,050
Oh, hey, look.

2038
02:35:00,050 --> 02:35:01,050
He got off a rocket.

2039
02:35:01,690 --> 02:35:01,990
Yeah.

2040
02:35:05,810 --> 02:35:06,550
No more delays.

2041
02:35:06,570 --> 02:35:08,570
Why are we TPing with 30 seconds left?

2042
02:35:09,330 --> 02:35:09,930
That's true.

2043
02:35:10,130 --> 02:35:11,090
Who called for Puerda?

2044
02:35:12,110 --> 02:35:12,910
Oh, Buckwoofer.

2045
02:35:14,210 --> 02:35:15,570
Yeah, I also wonder...

2046
02:35:17,050 --> 02:35:19,590
Yeah, also, yeah, I'm not gonna lie, this TP's...

2047
02:35:21,610 --> 02:35:23,890
Like, what is this TP?

2048
02:35:24,770 --> 02:35:25,850
Oh my god!

2049
02:35:26,390 --> 02:35:27,210
Like, what?

2050
02:35:27,230 --> 02:35:28,290
Let's just go main every time.

2051
02:35:33,650 --> 02:35:35,170
Like, I'm dead in this.

2052
02:35:35,170 --> 02:35:38,410
Yeah, I was gonna say, there's no way I'm bursted.

2053
02:35:41,110 --> 02:35:42,230
Yeah, that...

2054
02:35:42,230 --> 02:35:44,770
That was a very interesting TP.

2055
02:35:45,490 --> 02:35:46,050
That...

2056
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:56,190
Yeah, not only like, why did we TP so early, but like...

2057
02:35:57,990 --> 02:36:00,310
Yeah, no, I don't think this...

2058
02:36:00,310 --> 02:36:02,230
I think this game was not it.

2059
02:36:03,350 --> 02:36:05,150
Why wouldn't it be on the portal?

2060
02:36:05,170 --> 02:36:06,290
Wait, why did he...

2061
02:36:06,290 --> 02:36:08,410
Yeah, like, you don't TP high ground anymore.

2062
02:36:08,490 --> 02:36:09,790
You just walk on point with TP.

2063
02:36:10,470 --> 02:36:12,930
You just walk on point.

2064
02:36:13,090 --> 02:36:14,790
There's no reason to TP on.

2065
02:36:18,630 --> 02:36:19,990
Alright, let's do it.

2066
02:36:20,210 --> 02:36:25,250
The Sue Luna thing that Wooply kept yelling about.

2067
02:36:25,610 --> 02:36:27,110
Being the perfect dive counter.

2068
02:36:29,750 --> 02:36:31,490
Yeah, and we're leaving him on...

2069
02:36:31,490 --> 02:36:32,790
I think we're...

2070
02:36:32,790 --> 02:36:35,130
We have to avoid the...

2071
02:36:35,170 --> 02:36:39,790
Iron Man because we're leaving him TPS

2072
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:55,440
Would have what if I got the skin It'd be

2073
02:37:05,910 --> 02:37:25,050

2080
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:16,880
Oh my god.

2081
02:38:19,820 --> 02:38:22,700
True solo queue is miserable.

2082
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:28,660
Okay, let's chill this guy.

2083
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:29,860
There we go.

2084
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:31,280

2085
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:32,540

02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:35,400
Get your ass here.

2088
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:43,680
newcomers the way of the raccoon putting in that fucking work baby putting in that

2091
02:39:24,290 --> 02:39:45,990

2092
02:39:51,890 --> 02:39:53,270
It's fine, we have...

2093
02:39:55,810 --> 02:39:56,290
Bro,

2094
02:39:59,730 --> 02:40:02,310
brother, I'm playing a useful support and I'm healing my team.

2095
02:40:02,730 --> 02:40:08,270
You can't do it because your ego is too large to want to play an actual support so you want to play Rocket instead.

2096
02:40:09,290 --> 02:40:10,670
Oh, we lost both.

2097
02:40:11,610 --> 02:40:12,430
I'm scared.

2098
02:40:15,970 --> 02:40:16,450
Okay.

2099
02:40:17,450 --> 02:40:40,890
okay i don't feel okay oh we're not oh my god we're not okay we are not okay oh my god we are we're not okay we're i am gonna be that guy but the fact that you know the thing that's projecting is you like what the fuck your decisions are it shows what person you are

2100
02:40:47,270 --> 02:40:50,190
don't think we were okay in the end.

2101
02:40:50,410 --> 02:40:58,330
I don't think we were okay in the end.

2102
02:40:59,410 --> 02:40:59,450
Five.

2103
02:40:59,570 --> 02:41:00,470
Oh yeah, he was on Rocket.

2104
02:41:01,090 --> 02:41:01,770
That's what I'm saying.

2105
02:41:02,030 --> 02:41:03,430
He's a Bucky player.

2106
02:41:04,150 --> 02:41:05,930
Why the fuck would you play Rocket?

2107
02:41:06,890 --> 02:41:11,470
Bucky requires like so much like positioning and aim.

2108
02:41:12,010 --> 02:41:14,170
Why are you a Rocket player?

2109
02:41:18,350 --> 02:41:21,310
All right, maybe it is time for retail there.

2110
02:41:21,390 --> 02:41:23,370
Okay, did I level up though my battle pass?

2111
02:41:24,210 --> 02:41:27,490
Guys, I just need one more level.

2112
02:41:27,890 --> 02:41:28,470
Okay, okay.

2113
02:41:28,610 --> 02:41:29,130
Let's see.

2114
02:41:29,950 --> 02:41:31,030
There you go.

2115
02:41:32,310 --> 02:41:32,670
Guys, look.

2116
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:34,950
I have four.

2117
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:37,490
Oh, I have this.

2118
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:38,870
I have this poster in real life.

2119
02:41:39,030 --> 02:41:39,750
They gave it to me.

2120
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:40,090
Do you remember?

2121
02:41:40,530 --> 02:41:40,770
Please.

2122
02:41:44,030 --> 02:41:46,030
Guys, but I got frozen flow.

2123
02:41:48,150 --> 02:41:51,030
Guys, look, I just need one level.

2124
02:41:53,510 --> 02:41:54,190
Look at that, guys.

2125
02:41:54,350 --> 02:41:54,950
Just one.

2126
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:55,590
Look, see?

2127
02:41:55,710 --> 02:41:56,750
I had this, though.

2128
02:41:57,210 --> 02:41:59,070
It's almost like the Luna skin.

2129
02:42:00,430 --> 02:42:00,790
See?

2130
02:42:02,210 --> 02:42:03,150
Look at that.

2131
02:42:03,450 --> 02:42:04,250
It's almost...

2132
02:42:04,250 --> 02:42:05,510
I don't like the hair color.

2133
02:42:05,610 --> 02:42:06,070
I just...

2134
02:42:06,070 --> 02:42:10,770
If it could have been any other hair color, I would have been fine with the hairstyle if the hair color was different.

2135
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:13,650
I don't even like the recolors for this, too.

2136
02:42:15,370 --> 02:42:16,430
Guys, it's fine.

2137
02:42:16,510 --> 02:42:17,250
I can make it.

2138
02:42:17,270 --> 02:42:23,090
that's like what two to three more games that's okay the reason why is this

2139
02:42:26,770 --> 02:42:36,330
guys oh my god i'm literally missing 10 okay oh my god it's one dollar okay guys it's one dollar i'm gonna use the bathroom real quick of your back

2140
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:57,950

2141
02:43:05,780 --> 02:43:08,040

2145
02:44:07,860 --> 02:44:13,020
Does the recolor require yellow currency or blue currency?

2146
02:44:13,420 --> 02:44:14,520
Guys, this is important.

2147
02:44:22,120 --> 02:44:22,740
Pick your hero.

2148
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:24,880
Is it yellow currency or...

2149
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:26,440
I can't do it now!

2150
02:44:26,780 --> 02:44:27,460

Okay, that's all that matters.

2154
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:35,140
I have enough.

2155
02:44:36,040 --> 02:44:36,320
Okay.

2156
02:44:37,640 --> 02:44:38,440
Hey, guys.

2157
02:44:38,840 --> 02:44:40,080
If only I had...

2158
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:40,840
You know...

2159
02:44:40,940 --> 02:44:42,100
He could have stopped Q.

2160
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:43,640
It's not my fault.

2161
02:44:44,700 --> 02:44:45,900
He could have stopped Q.

2162
02:44:47,060 --> 02:44:48,020
That's all I'm saying.

2163
02:44:48,480 --> 02:44:50,620
He could have waited for me to buy it.

2164
02:44:50,820 --> 02:44:51,360
That's not him.

2165
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:52,220
That's not him.

2166
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:53,180
That's Wupply's fault.

2167
02:44:53,700 --> 02:44:54,760
He didn't stop Q.

2168
02:44:59,540 --> 02:45:00,760
So it's not my fault.

2169
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:08,600
Yeah, it's Wupply's fault.

2170
02:45:08,700 --> 02:45:09,120
Look at him.

2171
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:10,840
Denying the people what they want.

2172
02:45:10,940 --> 02:45:24,680

02:49:20,530 --> 02:49:23,770

2207
02:49:33,190 --> 02:49:35,290
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

2208
02:49:35,730 --> 02:49:36,390
Got it?

2209
02:49:36,510 --> 02:49:37,130

And he lives?

2216
02:50:00,050 --> 02:50:03,470
Like, I literally saw all of us just shoot the venom.

2217
02:50:04,010 --> 02:50:04,570
Wait, why?

2218
02:50:05,110 --> 02:50:06,490

2222
02:50:40,510 --> 02:50:41,070
Oh, yeah.

2223
02:50:42,030 --> 02:50:43,330
I watched that new boss baby.

2224
02:50:44,050 --> 02:50:45,290
Oh, I almost let him die.

2225
02:50:45,530 --> 02:50:47,810
I watched that new boss baby movie, the back in...

2226
02:50:47,810 --> 02:50:48,550
Okay, it's not new.

2227
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:49,990
It came out, like, years ago.

2228
02:50:50,350 --> 02:50:51,130
But, like...

2229
02:50:52,790 --> 02:50:54,870
But, like, that new boss...

2230
02:50:54,870 --> 02:50:57,470
The last boss baby movie is...

2231
02:50:57,470 --> 02:50:58,150
Oh, my God.

2232
02:50:58,410 --> 02:50:58,870
I...

2233
02:50:59,110 --> 02:50:59,910

2234
02:51:00,070 --> 02:51:00,370
I...

2235
02:51:00,370 --> 02:51:02,990
Maybe that's karma for talking about boss baby.

2236
02:51:04,970 --> 02:51:07,110
But, like, it's actually cool.

2237
02:51:07,130 --> 02:51:51,090

Like, so you guys can see how weird the last Boss Baby movie was.

2243
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:53,500
Because that was the last Boss Baby movie I didn't watch.

2244
02:53:53,620 --> 02:53:54,840
It was the last one.

2245
02:53:55,920 --> 02:53:56,320
Oh, yeah.

2246
02:53:56,420 --> 02:53:58,360
You're missing out on the intro, by the way.

2247
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:01,940
I got to see the intro.

2248
02:54:02,240 --> 02:54:03,120
Oh, whoa.

2249
02:54:03,220 --> 02:54:04,660
Okay, you saw the part that matters.

2250
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:07,880
All right.

2251
02:54:09,160 --> 02:54:09,600
Wait.

2252
02:54:11,360 --> 02:54:12,620
Okay, let's grab.

2253
02:54:14,060 --> 02:54:16,200
Okay, let's see it again, because you guys missed it.

2254
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:18,980
What is this?

2255
02:54:20,780 --> 02:54:21,320
Whoa!

2256
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:22,100
Feet.

2257
02:54:27,280 --> 02:54:27,580
Wee!

2258
02:54:28,340 --> 02:54:32,540
I will say the oldest really pretty, but it's also so much clutter.

2259
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:34,680
It's so much clutter.

2260
02:54:34,860 --> 02:54:35,560
Okay, customize.

2261
02:54:35,720 --> 02:54:36,300
Where's the yellow?

2262
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:37,940
Oh, the other...

2263
02:54:37,940 --> 02:54:42,000
Oh, this one's pretty ugly, but...

2264
02:54:42,440 --> 02:54:44,180
I am ready to put on a show.

2265
02:54:44,500 --> 02:54:46,880
I would say this is really cute.

2266
02:54:48,600 --> 02:54:50,220
But it's also like a lot.

2267
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:51,840
Wait, how do I afford this?

2268
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:54,380
You need 200 more for...

2269
02:54:54,380 --> 02:54:55,420
Or spend two...

2270
02:54:55,420 --> 02:54:56,960
I can't afford that.

2271
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:57,300
Alright.

2272
02:54:57,820 --> 02:54:59,720
I can't even afford it!

2273
02:55:00,140 --> 02:55:02,060
That was a lie!

2274
02:55:03,380 --> 02:55:04,500
Oh my god.

2275
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:06,560
I need to spend another $5.

2276
02:55:07,720 --> 02:55:12,420
If I leveled up twice, I wouldn't have had to spend another $5.

2277
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:13,000
dollars.

2278
02:55:13,480 --> 02:55:19,200
I don't have the battle pass.

2279
02:55:19,740 --> 02:55:21,180
I don't have it.

2280
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:26,580

2284
02:55:44,660 --> 02:55:46,020

02:55:47,780 --> 02:55:49,400
Wait, where is it?

2286
02:55:50,620 --> 02:55:51,240

Black Mesa.

2334
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:43,940
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

2335
03:01:46,320 --> 03:01:49,140
Because, like, I'm just thinking, like, who the fucking Bann's name right?

2338
03:02:00,100 --> 03:02:03,920

Oh, I have to get used to the new sound effects too.

2361
03:03:48,280 --> 03:03:49,560
This is, they're all...

2362
03:03:50,760 --> 03:03:56,880
It's like all new healing sound effects and it throws me off a little because I'm not used to the...

2363
03:03:58,200 --> 03:04:01,180
Because I played Luna for so long, I'm not used to it.

2364
03:04:02,140 --> 03:04:03,300
Oh, she likes to close.

2365
03:04:04,300 --> 03:04:06,080
Just like... Oh, okay.

2366
03:04:11,540 --> 03:04:12,800
They're fine, right?

2367
03:04:13,100 --> 03:04:13,780
Yeah, she's fine.

2368
03:04:18,040 --> 03:04:18,920
Okay, just...

2369
03:04:18,920 --> 03:04:20,600
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

2370
03:04:20,800 --> 03:04:21,840
You're so healthy!

2371
03:04:22,980 --> 03:04:23,420
See?

2372
03:04:23,700 --> 03:04:25,040
Look at me go!

2373
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:26,020

2377
03:04:32,420 --> 03:04:33,340
Are they coming?

2378
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:34,540
I can't hear shit, man.

2379
03:04:34,620 --> 03:04:35,640
My music loud as fuck.

2380
03:04:36,100 --> 03:04:36,460
Damn.

2381
03:04:36,620 --> 03:04:37,120
No, not yet.

2382
03:04:39,360 --> 03:04:41,220
Okay, we gotta give Spider-Man.

2383
03:04:41,440 --> 03:04:42,240
Oh, you mean the GP, my god.

2384
03:04:43,020 --> 03:04:43,740

2385
03:04:43,920 --> 03:04:44,500

I got him.

2389
03:04:47,380 --> 03:04:50,760
I hit like everybody else but the Spider-Man.

2390
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:52,280
Oh, nice dude.

2391
03:04:52,560 --> 03:04:53,500
And you got a kill through it?

2392
03:04:53,560 --> 03:04:53,980
What the hell?

2393
03:04:54,280 --> 03:04:58,600
I literally healed everybody but that was...

2394
03:04:58,600 --> 03:05:01,300
Think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think.

2395

03:09:20,370 --> 03:09:21,450
Wait, Spider-Man kills everything here.

2437
03:09:21,730 --> 03:09:22,350

2438
03:09:22,970 --> 03:09:23,590

03:09:42,780 --> 03:09:43,820
He double head.

2447
03:09:44,200 --> 03:09:48,500
He did that double heady.

2448
03:09:50,020 --> 03:09:54,400
Bro, okay, our Spider-Man is getting the absolute pocket of his fucking life though.

2449

2450
03:10:31,800 --> 03:10:33,280
I'm not used to it at all.

2451
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:36,320
No, no!

2452
03:10:36,660 --> 03:10:38,180

03:10:43,960 --> 03:10:45,060
I feel so safe.

2456
03:10:49,140 --> 03:10:51,160
This is where I start fearing.

2457
03:10:52,720 --> 03:10:53,280
No!

2458
03:10:56,270 --> 03:10:57,710

2459
03:10:58,390 --> 03:10:59,110

2461
03:11:01,430 --> 03:11:02,190
I knew it.

2462
03:11:04,770 --> 03:11:07,530
I knew that was going to happen to me.

2463
03:11:09,330 --> 03:11:09,590

2464
03:11:10,390 --> 03:11:10,950

2474
03:11:33,740 --> 03:11:34,780
Oh my god, okay.

2475
03:11:34,880 --> 03:11:36,300

Oh my God.

2491
03:13:52,830 --> 03:13:53,810
Oh, you walled us off.

2492
03:13:53,990 --> 03:13:54,530
You walled off.

03:13:54,750 --> 03:13:55,250
What the fuck?

2494
03:13:55,770 --> 03:13:56,750
Oh, don't put water.

2495
03:14:00,380 --> 03:14:01,380
Oh my God.

2496
03:14:01,520 --> 03:14:02,780
I don't think...

2497
03:14:02,880 --> 03:14:05,220
I don't think Adam's the pick, guys.

2498
03:14:06,100 --> 03:14:06,460
I...

2499
03:14:07,540 --> 03:14:10,400
I don't think Adam's...

2500
03:14:10,400 --> 03:14:14,700
I don't think Adam is the pick, guys.

2501
03:14:15,120 --> 03:14:16,640
I don't...

2502
03:14:18,600 --> 03:14:21,640
I didn't use the team-up because I didn't think I needed...

2503
03:14:21,640 --> 03:14:23,100
Oh, I wasted that team-up, too.

2504
03:14:24,980 --> 03:14:27,180
I didn't... I thought his shield was gonna...

2505
03:14:31,100 --> 03:14:32,440
Oh my god.

2506
03:14:32,880 --> 03:14:35,260
That sucks because both the supports are not.

2507
03:14:38,160 --> 03:14:39,420
Yeah, I have to die there.

2508
03:14:44,140 --> 03:14:48,660
I don't think Adam is the character to play.

2509
03:14:51,420 --> 03:14:51,900
Yeah.

2510
03:14:53,620 --> 03:14:54,340

2513
03:14:58,500 --> 03:15:00,780
The warlock was a little...

2514
03:15:00,780 --> 03:15:02,600
Just a little bit...

2515
03:15:02,880 --> 03:15:05,960
Of a maybe a throw just maybe though.

2516
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:06,880

We have a good support system.

2528
03:15:51,230 --> 03:15:52,430
We have a good support system.

2529
03:15:52,650 --> 03:15:53,830
A good, a good pattern.

2530
03:15:54,970 --> 03:15:55,950
We rotate us.

2531
03:15:56,250 --> 03:15:57,750
Oh my god, you're alive.

2532
03:15:58,830 --> 03:15:59,870
That guy is...

2533
03:15:59,870 --> 03:15:59,990
Ah!

2534
03:16:01,750 --> 03:16:02,270
Please.

2535
03:16:03,450 --> 03:16:05,230
You can copy whenever you want.

2536
03:16:05,390 --> 03:16:06,030
You can copy.

2537
03:16:07,050 --> 03:16:08,350
I'm literally right there.

2538
03:16:09,090 --> 03:16:09,990
I'm right here.

2539
03:16:11,910 --> 03:16:13,650
I'm right here.

2540
03:16:17,090 --> 03:16:18,670
Just because I don't...

2541
03:16:18,670 --> 03:16:19,930
Yeah, I'm just... yeah.

2542
03:16:24,430 --> 03:16:27,690
Okay, Loki, you and I, we can live this together.

2543
03:16:32,070 --> 03:16:34,150
We didn't live this together.

2544
03:16:34,750 --> 03:16:34,990
Wait.

2545
03:16:37,070 --> 03:16:37,550
Wait.

2546
03:16:40,630 --> 03:16:46,130
We didn't lose- I just think he died this fast, not gonna lie.

2547
03:16:46,970 --> 03:16:48,470
No, just- just play- let's play strange.

2548
03:16:48,770 --> 03:16:48,890
Play strange.

2549
03:16:49,330 --> 03:16:50,190
You won't get- you won't get shot.

2550
03:16:51,310 --> 03:16:52,170
It'll be a lot easier.

2551
03:16:52,990 --> 03:16:55,690
They're not playing bad birds.

2552
03:16:56,230 --> 03:17:03,130
Oh, we're gonna run down because we have no like- We were running Adam Warlock and had no healing.

2553
03:17:03,770 --> 03:17:05,970
Now we're just gonna run down- He swapped off after first point.

2554
03:17:06,350 --> 03:17:07,690
No, that's the- that's the worst excuse.

2555
03:17:07,970 --> 03:17:09,030
They've been winning because they're old.

2556
03:17:09,330 --> 03:17:10,230
They've had better olds than me.

2557
03:17:10,250 --> 03:17:14,530
I mean, we don't have a shield for the Hawkeye.

2558
03:17:16,590 --> 03:17:17,530
Oh my god.

2559
03:17:19,270 --> 03:17:20,030
We got Groot!

2560
03:17:21,950 --> 03:17:23,730
Oh, I'm scared.

2561
03:17:24,410 --> 03:17:25,490
I'm trying to...

2562
03:17:25,490 --> 03:17:26,690
Oh my.

2563
03:17:30,340 --> 03:17:31,800
I'm so scared.

2564
03:17:34,860 --> 03:17:35,900
Our poor mag.

2565
03:17:39,770 --> 03:17:41,170
Oh my god.

2566
03:17:41,830 --> 03:17:42,990
Our poor team.

2567
03:17:45,510 --> 03:17:49,870
Oh, I was like, they're putting Wanda and you're dying to try to make them swap.

2568
03:17:53,810 --> 03:17:57,380
Um, but...

2569
03:17:58,840 --> 03:17:59,720
How far?

2570
03:18:00,280 --> 03:18:01,600
How far do I have to be?

2571
03:18:01,920 --> 03:18:03,860
How far do I have to be?

2572
03:18:04,060 --> 03:18:06,440
I felt like I was going so far.

2573
03:18:06,940 --> 03:18:09,260
I felt like I was so far.

2574
03:18:09,280 --> 03:18:10,720
We're playing double dive into Wanda.

2575
03:18:11,020 --> 03:18:11,420
Can we swap?

2576
03:18:12,560 --> 03:18:13,660
I legitimately stuck.

2577
03:18:13,680 --> 03:18:15,260
Oh, no, this is for the Hawk guy.

2578
03:18:16,720 --> 03:18:21,180
Oh my god, that would have been so clutch if I hit that freeze.

2579
03:18:21,860 --> 03:19:15,420
That would have been so clutch if I hit that I thought I was far enough Oh my I'm so sad If I hit that freeze that would have been clutch as hell Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki The current score is three two three time to switch things up including which oh man i'm luna snow like guys i don't think we're winning this this kid might be a curse this kid may be a curse guys i think wanda counters dive and we're going double dive well okay first off what makes you think that wanda is good against my character tell me he's he's rank bigger man No,

2580
03:19:15,620 --> 03:19:16,520
you hold left click.

2581
03:19:16,700 --> 03:19:17,120
That's it.

2582
03:19:17,780 --> 03:19:21,600
The- what is the- where's the fundamentals of it?

2583
03:19:22,740 --> 03:19:24,860
He's- He's a rake player.

2584
03:19:25,460 --> 03:19:27,120
The character fucking blows.

2585
03:19:27,340 --> 03:19:29,540
It doesn't matter that she- that the character counters me.

2586
03:19:29,900 --> 03:19:30,780
And the character doesn't.

2587
03:19:31,480 --> 03:19:33,040
You're- you're such a rage baiter.

2588
03:19:33,340 --> 03:19:34,840
What do you mean one that doesn't counter die?

2589
03:19:35,660 --> 03:19:37,920
He's a- Dude, the character is bad!

2590
03:19:38,080 --> 03:19:39,060
It's a bad character!

2591
03:19:39,360 --> 03:19:40,120
He doesn't do anything!

2592
03:19:40,600 --> 03:19:42,460
It's only for characters who can't aim.

2593
03:19:42,760 --> 03:19:55,340
Okay, maybe surely for Spider-Man it will be easier to- kill them out of the air but at the same time the the value that the character does is like nothing no but she doesn't do anything against me she doesn't she does a little bit against spider-man It doesn't do anything to me.

2594
03:19:55,340 --> 03:19:56,760
I don't think Wanda was a problem.

2595
03:19:56,860 --> 03:19:57,860
You don't have nothing to back yourself.

2596
03:19:58,660 --> 03:19:58,860
Stop it.

2597
03:20:00,580 --> 03:20:01,340
Quit raging.

2598
03:20:01,960 --> 03:20:02,080
Listen.

2599
03:20:02,980 --> 03:20:04,020
Would you be quit raging?

2600
03:20:04,320 --> 03:20:05,440
You're rage baiting me.

2601
03:20:05,900 --> 03:20:06,760
I'm not rage baiting.

2602
03:20:07,160 --> 03:20:08,520
I'm just, I'm calming and telling you.

2603
03:20:08,660 --> 03:20:10,480
You're getting countered by a...

2604
03:20:10,480 --> 03:20:11,420
It's not a counter.

2605
03:20:11,580 --> 03:20:12,380
It's not a counter.

2606
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:15,660
What the fuck was this fucking spoiler?

2607
03:20:15,780 --> 03:20:18,280
You walk into the back line and then you get a lot of luck on me.

2608
03:20:18,460 --> 03:20:18,560
No.

2609
03:20:18,820 --> 03:20:19,900
Who, do you have a coach?

2610
03:20:20,480 --> 03:20:21,540
Are you, have you been taught the game?

2611
03:20:22,240 --> 03:20:23,560
What are you talking about?

2612
03:20:24,380 --> 03:20:27,760
Oh my god, what are you talking about?

2613
03:20:29,720 --> 03:20:32,840
Do you have a coach?

2614
03:20:36,980 --> 03:20:40,220
Do you have a coach?

2615
03:20:41,240 --> 03:20:45,180
When you die?

2616
03:20:49,920 --> 03:20:50,420
Nice.

2617
03:20:52,760 --> 03:20:54,160
Oh, that's unlucky.

2618
03:21:01,610 --> 03:21:03,270
I want to give the...

2619
03:21:10,420 --> 03:21:12,120
Do you have a coat?

2620
03:21:12,980 --> 03:21:13,800
Dude, they...

2621
03:21:13,800 --> 03:21:14,600
Oh, they don't know.

2622
03:21:16,940 --> 03:21:18,940
Oh, I didn't think we should have used that.

2623
03:21:19,560 --> 03:21:20,760
Because they can still portal in.

2624
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:22,360
But they didn't, thank God.

2625
03:21:24,060 --> 03:21:25,740
They didn't portal in, that's good.

2626
03:21:32,690 --> 03:21:34,930
Oh, they have four minutes.

2627
03:21:35,090 --> 03:21:36,290
Jesus Christ.

2628
03:21:37,370 --> 03:21:38,910
They actually have four minutes for this.

2629
03:21:40,250 --> 03:21:40,810
I'm scared.

2630
03:21:40,950 --> 03:21:43,470
I go to back leg now.

2631
03:21:53,110 --> 03:21:53,990
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2632
03:21:57,870 --> 03:21:59,690
Oh my god.

2633
03:21:59,750 --> 03:22:01,010
I have to back up too.

2634
03:22:03,550 --> 03:22:04,950
I'm not gonna risk it.

2635
03:22:05,090 --> 03:22:06,350
Oh my god, she's so...

2636
03:22:06,350 --> 03:22:08,990
She's so, she's on fucking huge counter.

2637
03:22:10,390 --> 03:22:10,730
Absolutely.

2638
03:22:10,910 --> 03:22:11,410
Oh, what?

2639
03:22:12,970 --> 03:22:13,530
Yeah.

2640
03:22:14,810 --> 03:22:15,370
Okay.

2641
03:22:15,850 --> 03:22:16,210
Okay.

2642
03:22:16,750 --> 03:22:17,310
Okay.

2643
03:22:20,330 --> 03:22:21,350
I just saw it.

2644
03:22:21,430 --> 03:22:39,810
I saw you put your nuts on the on the Wanda, but he counted you though Four three two I don't know who I'm giving the count out to myself I give the countdown to myself guys Mike I have to know when I'm like who am I counting it for it?

2645
03:22:39,990 --> 03:22:40,490
It's for me.

2646
03:22:40,870 --> 03:22:41,230
It's for me.

2647
03:22:41,250 --> 03:22:43,750
I need to remind myself what deal is It's back.

2648
03:22:44,410 --> 03:22:44,850
It's back.

2649
03:22:47,110 --> 03:22:48,010
It's for us.

2650
03:22:48,270 --> 03:22:48,430
Yeah.

2651
03:22:49,970 --> 03:23:16,630

2654
03:24:00,570 --> 03:24:01,490
Can I have a coach?

2655
03:24:01,650 --> 03:24:03,510
I'm not very good at this game.

2656
03:24:19,550 --> 03:24:20,910
That's so funny.

2657
03:24:22,710 --> 03:24:23,690
That's the point, Meg.

2658
03:24:24,410 --> 03:24:24,690
That's good.

2659
03:24:26,350 --> 03:24:29,550
I was thinking, yeah, our Meg was most definitely not the one.

2660
03:24:29,770 --> 03:24:30,770
The problem.

2661
03:24:31,410 --> 03:24:32,230
At least he was.

2662
03:24:32,270 --> 03:24:33,050
I was fine.

2663
03:24:38,010 --> 03:24:48,070
definitely the item pick was a little bit of a troll he's rage we're all rage baiters oh never mind

2664
03:24:51,330 --> 03:24:53,090
yeah now you guys know what

2665
03:24:58,110 --> 03:25:01,450
duck thank you with the super chat thank you thank you

2666
03:25:06,810 --> 03:25:11,930
I feel like I'm just gonna randomly log here.

2667
03:25:12,190 --> 03:25:14,050
That's why I'm like scared.

2668
03:25:18,310 --> 03:25:21,890
I'm trying to knock it accidentally arrowed.

2669
03:25:29,630 --> 03:25:33,450
Okay, they don't have Hawkeye, so I don't have to be as scared, which is nice.

2670
03:25:37,200 --> 03:25:37,720
Okay.

2671
03:25:43,420 --> 03:25:44,500
Oh, reload!

2672
03:25:49,230 --> 03:25:51,310
Try and do as much damage as I can!

2673
03:25:51,870 --> 03:25:52,630
And also hit!

2674
03:25:55,870 --> 03:25:57,110
What the fuck?

2675
03:26:03,740 --> 03:26:06,200
I'm at 94, so I'm trying.

2676
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:10,240
He's so close.

2677
03:26:15,450 --> 03:26:17,070
Oh my god, he blocked it!

2678
03:26:17,170 --> 03:26:18,390
I don't have to be center stage.

2679
03:26:18,790 --> 03:26:20,270
I actually blocked it!

2680
03:26:21,990 --> 03:26:24,510
Okay, I have the ult for the strange.

2681
03:26:27,090 --> 03:26:29,310
I have the ult for the strange.

2682
03:26:29,930 --> 03:26:32,410
So, let's hope I don't get a strange ult.

2683
03:26:38,430 --> 03:26:40,190
The little things.

2684
03:26:40,790 --> 03:26:43,910
Let's hope I don't get a strange ult, guys.

2685
03:26:54,990 --> 03:27:04,320
I can have good reflexes, but he could come from the fucking sky, and I would not notice.

2686
03:27:05,060 --> 03:27:06,160
That's, like, the scary part.

2687
03:27:07,020 --> 03:27:08,140
Like, he could come from anywhere.

2688
03:27:09,140 --> 03:27:09,500
Like, see?

2689
03:27:09,640 --> 03:27:10,460
Like, that's what I mean.

2690
03:27:11,320 --> 03:27:11,900
He could...

2691
03:27:11,900 --> 03:27:13,040
Oh, please!

2692
03:27:13,240 --> 03:27:14,140
Please shoot me!

2693
03:27:14,360 --> 03:27:15,280
Oh, my God!

2694
03:27:15,380 --> 03:27:15,960
Thank you!

2695
03:27:17,700 --> 03:27:20,080
I sometimes like dance around the back.

2696
03:27:20,160 --> 03:27:21,660
just in case.

2697
03:27:23,140 --> 03:27:28,140
Just just in case that, you know, he's like, I'm here!

2698
03:27:28,680 --> 03:27:29,040
I'm here!

2699
03:27:29,360 --> 03:27:29,880
Look at me!

2700
03:27:30,320 --> 03:27:30,940
Look at me!

2701
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:31,540
I'm here!

2702
03:27:31,980 --> 03:27:32,580
I'm here!

2703
03:27:38,390 --> 03:27:38,630
Okay.

2704
03:27:39,830 --> 03:27:41,490
Gotta make sure he sees me, you know?

2705
03:27:43,450 --> 03:27:44,290
There you go.

2706
03:27:44,870 --> 03:27:45,850
I'm a hero!

2707
03:27:50,110 --> 03:27:50,670
Okay.

2708
03:27:51,290 --> 03:27:51,850
Okay.

2709
03:27:52,590 --> 03:27:53,270
We're heroes.

2710
03:27:53,350 --> 03:27:55,070
That mag was like, where is she?

2711
03:27:55,510 --> 03:27:56,150
Where is she?

2712
03:27:57,850 --> 03:27:58,610
I'm here.

2713
03:27:58,890 --> 03:27:59,990
I'm here in front of you.

2714
03:28:00,310 --> 03:28:00,850
I'm here.

2715
03:28:01,630 --> 03:28:01,890
I'm here.

2716
03:28:04,050 --> 03:28:05,150
I'm a hero.

2717
03:28:05,570 --> 03:28:09,770
Watch your sword.

2718
03:28:12,270 --> 03:28:13,770
Why did he not play at Hawkeye?

2719
03:28:13,890 --> 03:28:15,310
He was so good at Hawkeye.

2720
03:28:15,550 --> 03:28:16,290
Not gonna lie.

2721
03:28:16,410 --> 03:28:19,770
I felt like he was actually like doing so much for his team.

2722
03:28:21,350 --> 03:28:23,330
Like him not all around Hawkeye is actually strong.

2723
03:28:23,350 --> 03:28:35,130
I swear to God, unless he's throwing Unless he got yelled at and decided to throw I mean sometimes that happens when you get yelled at You're just like, you know what?

2724
03:28:35,330 --> 03:28:47,520
Fuck you I'm not that desperate to win Hey guys Hey guys Hey guys

2725
03:28:55,640 --> 03:28:56,920
I'm scared.

2726
03:29:05,140 --> 03:29:06,540
Why am I?

2727
03:29:08,720 --> 03:29:09,720
Why am I?

2728
03:29:10,280 --> 03:29:11,520
Why was it me?

2729
03:29:12,360 --> 03:29:13,000
What?

2730
03:29:13,840 --> 03:29:16,480
I don't know where I couldn't go anywhere.

2731
03:29:18,320 --> 03:29:19,140
Oh, they see not!

2732
03:29:19,400 --> 03:29:19,800
Yay!

2733
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:24,980
I was like, there was nowhere to go.

2734
03:29:25,320 --> 03:29:25,700
I ain't saying shit.

2735
03:29:26,020 --> 03:29:27,340
There was nowhere to go!

2736
03:29:27,620 --> 03:29:28,900
I was stuck in the corner.

2737
03:29:32,140 --> 03:29:34,080
We did it.

2738
03:29:34,560 --> 03:29:37,180
See, the skin is in a curse.

2739
03:29:38,180 --> 03:29:39,740
Yeah, they see nine.

2740
03:29:40,140 --> 03:29:41,140
They send nine.

2741
03:29:42,240 --> 03:29:43,540
No, that's it.

2742
03:29:44,100 --> 03:29:44,600
Yay.

2743
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:50,420
I thought he was going to look at the other Luna.

2744
03:29:52,980 --> 03:29:54,640
On her counter us, bro.

2745
03:29:54,940 --> 03:29:56,480
She swapped by the way.

2746
03:30:01,960 --> 03:30:03,620
She's so hot, by the way.

2747
03:30:06,300 --> 03:30:07,420
Bring it water.

2748
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:08,520
All right, no.

2749
03:30:19,060 --> 03:30:23,780
Guys, if I was streaming, you guys would have heard me, like, screaming at my mic the entire time.

2750
03:30:23,860 --> 03:30:24,020
All right.

2751
03:30:24,200 --> 03:30:25,820
This guy pissed me the fuck off.

2752
03:30:26,100 --> 03:30:26,480
I'm back.

2753
03:30:27,760 --> 03:30:28,840
I can change the sound effects?

2754
03:30:29,120 --> 03:30:29,420
Okay.

2755
03:30:30,540 --> 03:30:31,580
I need to change it.

2756
03:30:31,660 --> 03:30:32,800
I hate...

2757
03:30:33,460 --> 03:30:37,120
Man, that Magneto was way better than me.

2758
03:30:37,260 --> 03:30:38,700
True, you could have not for the one.

2759
03:30:39,200 --> 03:30:39,700
The counter!

2760
03:30:41,740 --> 03:30:41,980
Bro.

2761
03:30:43,460 --> 03:30:44,740
Alright, let's see.

2762
03:30:48,040 --> 03:30:49,420
Bro, is he okay?

2763
03:30:49,720 --> 03:30:51,420
Is this like...

2764
03:30:51,420 --> 03:30:53,440
Does he have like a fucking...

2765
03:30:56,560 --> 03:30:58,080
Bro, are you okay, buddy?

2766
03:30:58,480 --> 03:31:00,200
Why are you so...

2767
03:31:00,200 --> 03:31:00,960
So sad.

2768
03:31:11,180 --> 03:31:12,700
Ooply dooply.

2769
03:31:15,530 --> 03:31:16,010
All right.

2770
03:31:17,130 --> 03:31:18,870
They are in GM.

2771
03:31:20,050 --> 03:31:21,150
That's why they're shot.

2772
03:31:22,010 --> 03:31:23,970
They're shot little guys.

2773
03:31:24,890 --> 03:31:26,590
There's one that countered him.

2774
03:31:29,450 --> 03:31:31,330
I mean, like a Loki cloak and dagger.

2775
03:31:34,470 --> 03:31:35,610
A band torch.

2776
03:31:38,410 --> 03:31:38,910
Oh, yeah.

2777
03:31:39,830 --> 03:31:40,990
I do have this.

2778
03:31:42,670 --> 03:31:43,290
All right.

2779
03:31:44,250 --> 03:31:48,910
The only thing I don't like, I like the skin, but, like, his robe covers everything.

2780
03:31:49,790 --> 03:31:51,850
So that's why I go presidential.

2781
03:31:52,650 --> 03:31:53,430
Because there's no point.

2782
03:31:54,930 --> 03:31:57,210
His robe covers everything, so there's no point.

2783
03:32:06,090 --> 03:32:06,690
I don't know.

2784
03:32:06,950 --> 03:32:10,290
I don't, I like, I don't like the robe as much.

2785
03:32:10,290 --> 03:32:12,850
I don't like this robe as much as this.

2786
03:32:13,590 --> 03:32:16,230
This one, look, this reminds me of Tom Hilton more.

2787
03:32:19,290 --> 03:32:23,570
I'll just remind you of Tom Hilton more.

2788
03:32:24,050 --> 03:32:25,430
That's why I like it more.

2789
03:32:27,850 --> 03:32:28,630
I will lie.

2790
03:32:28,870 --> 03:32:29,590
I'm direct.

2791
03:32:33,470 --> 03:32:34,390
Okay, bro.

2792
03:32:34,790 --> 03:32:35,590
Okay.

2793
03:32:43,960 --> 03:32:46,320
It's the classic Loki.

2794
03:32:47,540 --> 03:32:50,380
With the slick back hair.

2795
03:32:50,820 --> 03:32:51,500
And everything.

2796
03:32:51,980 --> 03:32:52,660
It's a classic.

2797
03:32:53,660 --> 03:32:55,000
That's how you really feel.

2798
03:32:55,120 --> 03:32:58,400
I was a Tom Hilsson girl on Tumblr.

2799
03:32:58,780 --> 03:32:59,660
I told you guys.

2800
03:33:00,840 --> 03:33:01,760
I won't lie.

2801
03:33:02,700 --> 03:33:04,140
I know what I am.

2802
03:33:05,580 --> 03:33:06,720
I know my past.

2803
03:33:13,190 --> 03:33:14,890
Oh my god, this map again.

2804
03:33:14,970 --> 03:33:16,410
I literally just finished this map.

2805
03:33:17,630 --> 03:33:19,250
Okay, we're back.

2806
03:33:21,610 --> 03:33:23,010
Loud and proud.

2807
03:33:28,190 --> 03:33:54,870
Actually shameless Hey, hey, I wasn't a super Was it super hula girl at least At least I never stoop below super hula Because I never watched Doctor Who I watched like a bits and episodes of it But but when they like When Kavit Tenet wasn't the doctor anymore I didn't enjoy it anymore I'm sorry I don't like the other doctor,

2808
03:33:55,350 --> 03:33:57,970
whoever, whichever one that was.

2809
03:33:59,490 --> 03:34:00,470
I wasn't a...

2810
03:34:00,470 --> 03:34:01,250
What?

2811
03:34:01,550 --> 03:34:02,710
Don't worry about it.

2812
03:34:03,030 --> 03:34:03,710
Don't worry about...

2813
03:34:03,710 --> 03:34:05,330
You don't have to know about Super Hula.

2814
03:34:05,770 --> 03:34:06,290
You don't...

2815
03:34:08,690 --> 03:34:09,610
Don't worry.

2816
03:34:10,350 --> 03:34:12,050
You don't need to know.

2817
03:34:13,730 --> 03:34:14,930
Holy shit.

2818
03:34:15,190 --> 03:34:15,730
Wooply.

2819
03:34:16,930 --> 03:34:17,530
Exploded.

2820
03:34:21,310 --> 03:34:22,490
Oh my god.

2821
03:34:23,010 --> 03:34:49,110
exploded I might have to go I might have to go something else I mean I almost have up though holy shit I healed as much as I could all right that's fine

2822
03:34:52,880 --> 03:34:55,240
all right

2823
03:34:59,460 --> 03:35:02,520
But this is why you do confirmation

2824
03:35:16,930 --> 03:35:18,490
That's my bad.

2825
03:35:19,190 --> 03:35:21,850
That's I just noticed it.

2826
03:35:22,110 --> 03:35:23,230
I just noticed it.

2827
03:35:23,290 --> 03:35:24,350
That was my bad.

2828
03:35:24,950 --> 03:35:27,930
Okay, I would admit I fucked up there I actually

2829
03:35:32,030 --> 03:35:49,720

03:36:31,970 --> 03:36:34,910
Look, I... I know I messed up.

2832
03:36:43,450 --> 03:36:43,450
Okay.

2833
03:36:44,210 --> 03:36:45,970
I will not do that mistake again.

2834
03:36:47,090 --> 03:36:50,550
I think you can tell I also have not played Cloak in...

2835
03:36:50,550 --> 03:36:51,910
Your powers are mine!

2836
03:36:52,110 --> 03:36:54,410
I never had to play Cloak in so long, too.

2837
03:36:55,550 --> 03:36:56,250
That's the thing.

2838
03:36:56,510 --> 03:36:59,930
I never had to play with a play at Cloak.

2839
03:37:07,200 --> 03:38:02,750

2842
03:38:09,410 --> 03:38:09,890

2843
03:38:10,510 --> 03:38:10,710

Alright, nice.

2851
03:38:35,970 --> 03:38:37,870
I don't know how the fuck he died, but nice.

2852
03:38:39,550 --> 03:38:40,790
I hear someone above me.

2853
03:38:40,910 --> 03:38:41,830
I don't like it.

2854
03:38:43,010 --> 03:38:44,130
Oh, it's my Hella.

2855
03:38:48,150 --> 03:38:49,510
Please tell me I can...

2856
03:38:51,090 --> 03:38:51,950
That... nice.

2857
03:38:56,820 --> 03:38:57,780
There's a...

2858
03:38:58,580 --> 03:39:00,200
There's a guy behind my.

2859
03:39:03,660 --> 03:39:05,040
That... Oh, that's the enemy Hella.

2860
03:39:05,200 --> 03:39:05,820
Look at that!

2861
03:39:06,080 --> 03:39:07,240
We did it!

2862
03:39:07,260 --> 03:39:08,060
Again!

2863
03:39:10,500 --> 03:39:11,900
Look at that!

2864
03:39:13,060 --> 03:39:13,540
Yippee!

2865
03:39:14,140 --> 03:39:14,900
I did it!

2866
03:39:14,960 --> 03:39:15,520
I'm a hero.

2867
03:39:16,540 --> 03:39:17,160
As always.

2868
03:39:17,740 --> 03:39:18,320
A hero.

2869
03:39:19,460 --> 03:39:20,860
I don't have any emotes.

2870
03:39:22,100 --> 03:39:23,280
Oh, I should have healed.

2871
03:39:23,840 --> 03:39:25,140
Sorry, I was too busy gloating.

2872
03:39:26,240 --> 03:39:29,300
I was too busy letting everyone know what kind of person I am.

2873
03:39:31,400 --> 03:39:31,680
Yeah.

2874
03:39:32,420 --> 03:39:34,560
Our cloak should push up to build up.

2875
03:39:35,020 --> 03:39:36,040

03:40:32,760 --> 03:40:37,120
Oh, hey, there's the Iron Fist.

2880
03:40:37,860 --> 03:40:38,960
There was the Iron Fist.

2881
03:40:41,200 --> 03:40:44,300
Okay, I go the other side, I guess.

2882
03:40:44,680 --> 03:40:45,280

2883
03:40:47,560 --> 03:40:49,220
Fuck my shift, Pete.

2884
03:40:50,220 --> 03:40:51,160
That's unfortunate.

2885
03:40:54,040 --> 03:40:55,900
Oh, that's very unfortunate.

2886
03:40:57,420 --> 03:40:57,960
Oh.

2887
03:40:58,100 --> 03:41:10,060

2889
03:41:28,660 --> 03:41:30,740
I think they're gonna moon very soon.

2890
03:41:31,540 --> 03:41:34,120
It feels very moon-like environment.

2891
03:41:36,860 --> 03:41:37,220
Yeah.

2892
03:41:40,460 --> 03:41:40,860
Yeah.

2893
03:41:42,380 --> 03:41:43,180
Can we touch it?

2894
03:41:48,600 --> 03:41:49,800
Because I'm one.

2895
03:41:51,860 --> 03:41:53,000
Oh my god, that's unlucky.

2896
03:41:54,520 --> 03:41:55,160
It's okay.

2897
03:41:55,180 --> 03:41:57,260
They have strange ult.

2898
03:41:59,240 --> 03:41:59,940
Three.

2899
03:42:01,140 --> 03:42:04,780
And then, as long as I don't get strange ult, that's five.

2900
03:42:07,380 --> 03:42:08,280
He fell?

2901
03:42:10,870 --> 03:42:12,540
Oh, that's awkward.

2902
03:42:13,120 --> 03:42:14,060
That's awkward.

2903
03:42:17,010 --> 03:42:18,180
Oh, man.

2904
03:42:19,020 --> 03:42:19,410
That's...

2905
03:42:19,800 --> 03:42:21,420
Oh, that's awkward.

2906
03:42:21,840 --> 03:42:23,020
It's okay, I guess.

2907
03:42:23,780 --> 03:42:25,160
It's you and I.

2908
03:42:26,240 --> 03:42:27,060
It's okay.

2909
03:42:27,520 --> 03:42:31,900
It's oh, never mind How did the Phoenix spawn?

2910
03:42:34,480 --> 03:42:37,680
He fell Where did he go?

2911
03:42:39,320 --> 03:42:40,900
Where did our Phoenix go?

2912
03:42:45,760 --> 03:42:47,380
Maybe Emma kicked them out.

2913
03:42:47,600 --> 03:42:55,160
I hope to God that's what happened Okay, do we do it?

2914
03:42:57,800 --> 03:43:27,480
it yeah okay maybe not after what happened to me after after what happened to me when i close up i don't know i don't know okay maybe i'll try again i'll try i'll try again maybe Maybe it won't be as bad.

2915
03:43:30,740 --> 03:43:31,600
Maybe it won't be bad.

2916
03:43:32,520 --> 03:43:34,140
What's a jokie bird?

2917
03:43:34,940 --> 03:43:35,660
It's a bird.

2918
03:43:37,620 --> 03:43:40,260
Guys, maybe this time it won't be as embarrassing.

2919
03:43:41,340 --> 03:43:43,740
I just don't copy cloaks.

2920
03:43:45,480 --> 03:43:47,740
It's so rare to play with a cloak.

2921
03:43:52,920 --> 03:43:54,560
Actually, I think I fucked it up.

2922
03:43:56,020 --> 03:43:57,560
Yeah, I think I fucked it up.

2923
03:44:00,080 --> 03:44:02,300
I don't know where to put my clones here.

2924
03:44:05,560 --> 03:44:06,640
I definitely fucked that up.

2925
03:44:07,200 --> 03:44:09,500
I don't know how to play defensive Loki here.

2926
03:44:10,520 --> 03:44:13,700
Like the placements of the stuff.

2927
03:44:22,550 --> 03:44:23,570
I should like...

2928
03:44:23,570 --> 03:44:24,870
Oh, I should have done what the other...

2929
03:44:24,870 --> 03:44:27,110
The Loki on my team was doing last game.

2930
03:44:27,450 --> 03:44:29,070
He like knew how to play Loki.

2931
03:44:30,790 --> 03:44:32,330
really good at it too.

2932
03:44:32,590 --> 03:44:34,410
I have many faces.

2933
03:44:35,050 --> 03:44:35,230
Yeah.

2934
03:44:35,990 --> 03:44:36,950
That was for me.

2935
03:44:39,050 --> 03:44:40,790
Because he put in like...

2936
03:44:41,490 --> 03:44:44,190
He put in like all...

2937
03:44:44,190 --> 03:44:45,610
One was like back here.

2938
03:44:46,090 --> 03:44:48,210
And I guess one was like in the front.

2939
03:44:48,950 --> 03:44:49,970
I think that's how he put it.

2940
03:44:52,250 --> 03:44:54,190
It was farther up but they destroyed them.

2941
03:44:54,290 --> 03:44:54,510
Yeah.

2942
03:44:55,210 --> 03:44:56,510
I wanted to live.

2943
03:44:58,630 --> 03:44:59,850
I was fine.

2944
03:45:00,030 --> 03:45:00,530
But thank you.

2945
03:45:11,660 --> 03:45:13,120
There you go.

2946
03:45:14,120 --> 03:45:14,640
Oh, fuck.

2947
03:45:14,780 --> 03:45:17,140
I did not realize our guy was so far.

2948
03:45:21,220 --> 03:45:22,820
It didn't let me press F.

2949
03:45:27,270 --> 03:45:28,130
Oh, no.

2950
03:45:28,330 --> 03:45:29,070
That's unfortunate.

2951
03:45:29,950 --> 03:45:30,230
It's okay.

2952
03:45:30,310 --> 03:45:30,970
We have Porta.

2953
03:45:33,550 --> 03:45:35,610
I pressed F and it didn't let me do it.

2954
03:45:35,930 --> 03:45:38,070
So I was like, what the fuck?

2955
03:45:39,830 --> 03:45:41,150
Where is...

2956
03:45:41,920 --> 03:45:42,730
Where's my cloak?

2957
03:45:43,730 --> 03:45:44,650
I'm trying to find my cloak.

2958
03:45:46,030 --> 03:45:46,590
Where is she?

2959
03:45:50,450 --> 03:45:50,910
Okay.

2960
03:45:58,590 --> 03:45:59,250
Okay.

2961
03:46:03,310 --> 03:46:04,190
That's fine.

2962
03:46:06,650 --> 03:46:06,990
That's fine.

2963
03:46:07,870 --> 03:46:09,510
I was like, where is she?

2964
03:46:09,530 --> 03:46:11,090
Where's the blonde woman?

2965
03:46:11,750 --> 03:46:13,370
It was so hard.

2966
03:46:14,470 --> 03:46:15,890
There's too many blonde women.

2967
03:46:16,190 --> 03:46:17,330
Where's my blonde women?

2968
03:46:19,210 --> 03:46:19,910
I quit.

2969
03:46:20,070 --> 03:46:21,350
I was like looking around.

2970
03:46:21,490 --> 03:46:22,750
I was like, where is she?

2971
03:46:25,870 --> 03:46:28,930
There's so many blonde women in this game.

2972
03:46:29,530 --> 03:46:30,490
Where's mine?

2973
03:46:39,360 --> 03:46:40,760
Holy shit.

2974
03:46:41,160 --> 03:46:42,120
I got scared.

2975
03:46:44,460 --> 03:46:44,940
Oh!

2976
03:46:45,960 --> 03:46:46,100
Oh!

2977
03:46:47,040 --> 03:46:48,100
How do I live that?

2978
03:46:48,380 --> 03:46:49,120
I don't know!

2979
03:46:52,470 --> 03:46:54,490
I was not living that.

2980
03:46:55,870 --> 03:46:58,370
I was definitely not living that.

2981
03:46:59,930 --> 03:47:00,630
Bro, that was...

2982
03:47:01,090 --> 03:47:01,770
That was scary.

2983
03:47:03,430 --> 03:47:04,830
There was nothing I could do there.

2984
03:47:05,090 --> 03:47:06,210
Literally, I was...

2985
03:47:06,210 --> 03:47:07,750
I could not even see the moon.

2986
03:47:09,330 --> 03:47:10,850
The light force is getting stronger.

2987
03:47:10,930 --> 03:47:12,790
You need to stop that vehicle in its train.

2988
03:47:14,570 --> 03:47:17,450
I'm definitely, like, not really good at killing placements here.

2989
03:47:25,740 --> 03:47:27,220
Let's engage the world.

2990
03:47:27,960 --> 03:47:29,720
Bro, fuck off.

2991
03:47:34,200 --> 03:47:34,720
Okay.

2992
03:47:36,380 --> 03:47:38,400
I mean, my lamps are working, I think.

2993
03:47:41,380 --> 03:47:43,820
I don't think I have to use it yet.

2994
03:47:44,600 --> 03:47:46,860
Yeah, I didn't think I had to use it after you reload, though.

2995
03:47:47,620 --> 03:47:49,620
He literally didn't know.

2996
03:47:50,540 --> 03:47:51,220
I'm everywhere.

2997
03:47:52,080 --> 03:47:52,520
Live!

2998
03:47:53,380 --> 03:47:54,900
Okay, nice, we live.

2999
03:47:58,900 --> 03:48:00,360
Yeah, he caught me in a dark alley.

3000
03:48:00,480 --> 03:48:01,420
He caught me in crime alley.

3001
03:48:02,060 --> 03:48:02,740
They put crime...

3002
03:48:04,600 --> 03:48:05,980
I don't know what to do.

3003
03:48:06,080 --> 03:48:07,040
I was in crime alley.

3004
03:48:16,710 --> 03:48:17,150
Okay.

3005
03:48:20,310 --> 03:48:21,270
Just in case.

3006
03:48:30,670 --> 03:48:31,110
I...

3007
03:48:31,110 --> 03:48:31,870
I...

3008
03:48:32,330 --> 03:48:33,690
Oh my god.

3009
03:48:36,810 --> 03:48:37,870
Oh my god.

3010
03:48:38,930 --> 03:48:40,630
What do I do now?

3011
03:48:48,410 --> 03:48:49,650
This!

3012
03:48:51,250 --> 03:48:51,490
Oh!

3013
03:48:52,770 --> 03:48:52,850
Ah!

3014
03:48:59,860 --> 03:49:02,860
He was following me everywhere!

3015
03:49:07,240 --> 03:49:07,900
Survive.

3016
03:49:08,320 --> 03:49:09,540
Mission successful.

3017
03:49:10,540 --> 03:49:12,820
Mission very successful.

3018
03:49:14,160 --> 03:49:16,320
Oh my god, he went to the wrong clone.

3019
03:49:16,520 --> 03:49:17,120
Ha ha, loser.

3020
03:49:17,640 --> 03:49:19,160
That was my clone, brother.

3021
03:49:24,910 --> 03:49:25,650
That's right.

3022
03:49:25,710 --> 03:49:26,670
You got the clone.

3023
03:49:28,610 --> 03:49:28,970
Guys.

3024
03:49:30,950 --> 03:49:32,190
Guys, he wants to kill me.

3025
03:49:36,930 --> 03:49:37,450
Guys.

3026
03:49:38,710 --> 03:49:46,340
Oh my god.

3027
03:49:46,700 --> 03:49:48,560
That was something I used every.

3028
03:49:48,600 --> 03:49:50,320
cool down I had.

3029
03:49:51,560 --> 03:49:57,280
It was literally every cool down possible to get there.

3030
03:49:58,500 --> 03:50:00,320
There was nothing else I could do.

3031
03:50:00,600 --> 03:50:02,060
I used everything.

3032
03:50:03,100 --> 03:50:06,780
I actually used all my cool down for that.

3033
03:50:07,220 --> 03:50:10,960
Oh my god, you're alive.

3034
03:50:11,880 --> 03:50:13,240
I don't know how.

3035
03:50:18,770 --> 03:50:20,250
Okay, bomb.

3036
03:50:22,910 --> 03:50:23,750
Okay.

3037
03:50:28,290 --> 03:50:29,610
I have to.

3038
03:50:35,010 --> 03:50:35,390
Oh!

3039
03:50:36,710 --> 03:50:36,990
Oh!

3040
03:50:37,870 --> 03:50:38,450
Oh!

3041
03:50:39,190 --> 03:50:39,390
Oh!

3042
03:50:44,760 --> 03:50:44,940
Oh!

3043
03:50:46,280 --> 03:50:46,700
Oh!

3044
03:50:47,460 --> 03:50:47,820
Oh!

3045
03:50:49,760 --> 03:50:52,460
I took one down with me!

3046
03:50:52,980 --> 03:50:54,800
I took one down with me!

3047
03:50:55,080 --> 03:51:01,480
I took him down.

3048
03:51:04,220 --> 03:51:04,960
I took him down.

3049
03:51:05,160 --> 03:51:06,070
I took him down.

3050
03:51:06,880 --> 03:51:08,280
I took him down.

3051
03:51:12,530 --> 03:51:14,110
Oh, shit.

3052
03:51:16,370 --> 03:51:18,130
I took all the matches.

3053
03:51:18,670 --> 03:51:22,610
I thought you would hate it.

3054
03:51:23,510 --> 03:51:24,850
I lived.

3055
03:51:25,810 --> 03:51:26,710

3062
03:53:22,890 --> 03:53:24,150

3063
03:53:34,490 --> 03:53:39,090
Why do you think I never played healers unless I'm in a mood?

3064

I am ready to put on a show.

3117
03:58:54,750 --> 03:58:56,130
Oh my god.

3118
03:59:00,020 --> 03:59:01,420
Oh my god.

3119
03:59:01,640 --> 03:59:03,160
I don't know what to do.

3120
03:59:03,560 --> 03:59:04,460
I run them.

3121
03:59:06,000 --> 03:59:06,560
If they run.

3122
03:59:06,560 --> 03:59:07,580
They can't see me.

3123
03:59:07,780 --> 03:59:08,940
They can't bully me.

3124
03:59:13,140 --> 03:59:14,420

3125
03:59:14,540 --> 03:59:16,340

04:00:13,060 --> 04:00:15,760
That was actually a hate crime.

3141
04:00:16,900 --> 04:00:19,940
Like, that was a hate crime towards women.

3142
04:00:25,860 --> 04:00:26,740
We're dead.

3143
04:00:27,220 --> 04:00:27,800
We're dead.

3144
04:00:29,000 --> 04:00:29,200

3145
04:00:29,200 --> 04:00:29,800
I'm dead.

3146
04:00:34,180 --> 04:00:35,380
That team...

3147
04:00:36,880 --> 04:00:41,320
We can live this if I also had my sudo by it.

3148
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:42,980
Oh my god.

3149
04:00:45,640 --> 04:00:47,180
I don't know if we live this.

3150
04:00:47,500 --> 04:00:47,800
Guys.

3151
04:00:52,330 --> 04:00:55,650
Okay, now I know for sure I'm getting heavily targeted.

3152
04:00:56,370 --> 04:00:59,550
Now, guys, guys, guys, we can live this.

3153
04:01:00,070 --> 04:01:02,150
We can live, we can just live this.

3154
04:01:02,770 --> 04:01:04,490
I just want to be alive.

3155
04:01:05,230 --> 04:01:05,990
It's fine.

3156
04:01:06,570 --> 04:01:07,090
It's fine.

3157
04:01:07,630 --> 04:01:09,810
Now I know I'm definitely getting targeted.

3158
04:01:10,170 --> 04:01:11,530

3159
04:01:11,970 --> 04:01:13,090

3162
04:01:26,030 --> 04:01:26,430
Wow!

3163
04:01:28,110 --> 04:01:29,410

3164
04:01:29,850 --> 04:01:30,530
Pretty weird!

04:01:31,550 --> 04:01:33,490
That's happening to me!

3166
04:01:34,670 --> 04:01:36,630
It's pretty fucking weird!

3167
04:01:42,240 --> 04:01:44,360

04:01:54,790 --> 04:01:56,650
What's going on?

3172
04:01:58,890 --> 04:02:00,650
Oh my god, get out of here.

3173
04:02:01,050 --> 04:02:03,570
Get out of here.

3174
04:02:03,990 --> 04:02:04,950
I'm alive.

3175
04:02:05,330 --> 04:02:06,230
I actually need a raise.

3176
04:02:06,630 --> 04:02:07,730
I'm doing so much.

3177
04:02:08,170 --> 04:02:09,390
I... I'm... I...

3178
04:02:09,390 --> 04:02:10,650
Oh my god.

3179
04:02:10,830 --> 04:02:11,750
I'm alive.

3180
04:02:12,310 --> 04:02:12,970
I'm alive!

3181
04:02:12,970 --> 04:02:13,430
I'm alive!

3182
04:02:16,570 --> 04:02:17,650
I'm not laughing.

3183
04:02:23,810 --> 04:02:25,630
Oh my god, he's gaming.

3184
04:02:25,790 --> 04:02:27,690
He's actually gaming.

3185
04:02:28,590 --> 04:02:31,130
This is a strong-ass wall that I can't break.

3186
04:02:35,110 --> 04:02:35,330
Okay.

3187
04:02:36,490 --> 04:02:37,930
Someone break this wall, please.

3188
04:02:39,150 --> 04:02:40,370
They built that wall.

3189
04:02:42,930 --> 04:02:44,650
They're gonna use that moon thing.

3190
04:02:45,070 --> 04:02:46,030
I can feel it.

3191
04:02:47,730 --> 04:02:49,590
Oh, in this first, in this first, in this first.

3192
04:02:50,530 --> 04:02:50,810
Okay.

3193
04:02:51,530 --> 04:02:52,270
I fucked up.

3194
04:02:53,430 --> 04:02:53,970
Bad.

3195
04:02:56,490 --> 04:02:58,430
They're going to Groot all after this.

3196
04:02:58,550 --> 04:02:59,310
I can feel it.

3197
04:03:07,100 --> 04:03:07,500
Okay.

3198
04:03:10,820 --> 04:03:11,100
Oh.

3199
04:03:12,360 --> 04:03:13,540
Oh my god.

3200
04:03:13,680 --> 04:03:14,860
I was not living that.

3201
04:03:16,400 --> 04:03:16,660
That's okay.

3202
04:03:16,740 --> 04:03:18,440
We have extermination.

3203
04:03:19,640 --> 04:03:19,980
Okay.

3204
04:03:22,020 --> 04:03:22,820
Where is...

3205
04:03:22,820 --> 04:03:23,620
Okay, there it is.

3206
04:03:25,320 --> 04:03:27,320
Oh, we don't have extermination.

3207
04:03:28,440 --> 04:03:29,600
Oh, we did.

3208
04:03:35,970 --> 04:03:36,910
God, please, I have to reload.

3209
04:03:37,890 --> 04:03:37,930
Please.

3210
04:03:38,890 --> 04:03:39,990
I have to reload.

3211
04:03:42,250 --> 04:03:43,350
I have to reload.

3212
04:03:43,630 --> 04:03:44,230
I'm sorry!

3213
04:03:49,320 --> 04:03:50,860
Oh, my God.

3214
04:03:51,240 --> 04:03:51,640
Please.

3215
04:03:51,640 --> 04:03:51,880
Fly up.

3216
04:03:51,900 --> 04:03:52,340
Fly up in the end.

3217
04:03:52,460 --> 04:03:53,060
Go for a hold.

3218
04:03:53,240 --> 04:03:53,540
Go for a hold.

3219
04:03:55,420 --> 04:03:55,820
Oh!

3220
04:03:56,680 --> 04:03:57,800
Please, I can't!

3221
04:03:58,180 --> 04:03:58,580
Oh!

3222
04:03:58,900 --> 04:03:59,600
One last fight.

3223
04:04:03,730 --> 04:04:04,170
Drizzle!

3224
04:04:06,410 --> 04:04:07,090
No!

3225
04:04:07,430 --> 04:04:08,630
He got frozen!

3226
04:04:09,810 --> 04:04:11,030
He actually got frozen!

3227
04:04:11,950 --> 04:04:13,490
He actually got frozen!

3228
04:04:14,790 --> 04:04:15,790
Oh my god!

3229
04:04:21,970 --> 04:04:23,630
Oh my god.

3230
04:04:23,930 --> 04:04:24,130
Please.

3231
04:04:24,510 --> 04:04:24,750
Please!

3232
04:04:25,030 --> 04:04:25,370
No!

3233
04:04:25,990 --> 04:04:27,290
Oh, I needed him to...

3234
04:04:27,290 --> 04:04:27,950
I needed...

3235
04:04:27,950 --> 04:04:29,290
We'll play to heal me there.

3236
04:04:29,970 --> 04:04:31,290
If he healed me, we...

3237
04:04:31,290 --> 04:04:32,210
I could have ulted.

3238
04:04:33,550 --> 04:04:35,130
I actually needed that heal.

3239
04:04:35,790 --> 04:04:38,010
Oh, it will be healing me there.

3240
04:04:38,510 --> 04:04:40,550
Instead of running away from me.

3241
04:04:41,810 --> 04:04:42,830
I could have had my...

3242
04:04:46,930 --> 04:04:48,090
That's crazy.

3243
04:04:48,470 --> 04:04:52,030
The amount that I am doing right now, I'm going to keep playing Luna.

3244
04:04:53,470 --> 04:04:54,170
Holy shit.

3245
04:04:54,850 --> 04:04:55,890
It was so tragic.

3246
04:04:55,990 --> 04:04:58,390
The one time I didn't get babysat.

3247
04:04:59,530 --> 04:05:00,950
That's so sad.

3248
04:05:01,190 --> 04:05:03,530
The one time I didn't get babysat.

3249
04:05:06,170 --> 04:05:08,190
when I was this close.

3250
04:05:12,270 --> 04:05:14,910
No, Wooply was next to me, but then he ran to the left.

3251
04:05:18,330 --> 04:05:19,630
He literally ran to the left.

3252
04:05:19,750 --> 04:05:20,750
He was next to me.

3253
04:05:27,300 --> 04:05:28,980
And he didn't run away.

3254
04:05:29,400 --> 04:05:32,660
I could have lived and got my queue.

3255
04:05:33,700 --> 04:05:37,080
There's like nearly one mistake that caused it.

3256
04:05:41,240 --> 04:05:46,800
okay that was crazy this i'm getting i'm actually getting heavy retargeted

3257
04:05:51,940 --> 04:06:12,460

3258
04:06:14,920 --> 04:06:17,900
And sometimes you'll be like that, you know, like the one mistake.

3259
04:06:20,040 --> 04:06:22,040
They literally just one mistake.

3260
04:06:25,900 --> 04:06:26,670
I have to use...

3261
04:06:28,300 --> 04:06:29,690
Jesus Christ, there's so much...

3262
04:06:30,420 --> 04:06:31,640
So much damage.

3263
04:06:33,800 --> 04:06:36,940
Oh my god, I'm like just holding left click.

3264
04:06:42,820 --> 04:06:43,780
Holy shit.

3265
04:06:45,640 --> 04:06:47,140
Oh my god.

3266
04:06:47,600 --> 04:06:50,520
The amount of healing we're both doing.

3267
04:06:52,160 --> 04:06:54,240
That's a fucking W key.

3268
04:06:55,520 --> 04:06:56,340
Holy shit.

3269
04:06:56,800 --> 04:07:00,120
Oh my god, wait, they're on triple, like 3.5 tank now.

3270
04:07:00,360 --> 04:07:01,220
Where we actually can't do anything.

3271
04:07:02,660 --> 04:07:03,940
Oh, this is awkward.

3272
04:07:04,880 --> 04:07:06,800
Well, they're not dead, so I can swap off.

3273
04:07:07,780 --> 04:07:08,640
Actually, I can.

3274
04:07:08,760 --> 04:07:09,780
Yeah, I can swap off.

3275
04:07:10,060 --> 04:07:10,140
Okay.

3276
04:07:11,520 --> 04:07:13,680
Dude, what do I play against that?

3277
04:07:13,800 --> 04:07:15,100
I'm like, what the...

3278
04:07:16,300 --> 04:07:16,740
Okay.

3279
04:07:17,920 --> 04:07:19,460
Okay, here you go.

3280
04:07:19,620 --> 04:07:21,020
No worries, I've got your back.

3281
04:07:22,040 --> 04:07:23,260
Aww, that's unlucky.

3282
04:07:32,290 --> 04:07:34,050
Okay, we gotta kill this guy.

3283
04:07:36,110 --> 04:07:38,170
Alright, we still have my...

3284
04:07:41,510 --> 04:07:41,950
Yeah!

3285
04:07:44,310 --> 04:07:47,070
I gotta TP, TP on point, TP on point, TP on point.

3286
04:07:48,830 --> 04:07:49,350
Okay.

3287
04:07:50,310 --> 04:07:51,310
Oh, not on point?

3288
04:07:51,610 --> 04:07:53,790
What the fuck TP is that?

3289
04:07:54,350 --> 04:07:56,310
Like, what the fuck?

3290
04:08:00,450 --> 04:08:02,050
I have to use that.

3291
04:08:03,870 --> 04:08:05,770
Jesus Christ, this damage.

3292
04:08:08,030 --> 04:08:11,570
Yeah, I was gonna say, I think he's gonna walk up to me.

3293
04:08:12,370 --> 04:08:16,110
So, I was like, no, this guy is absolutely...

3294
04:08:16,670 --> 04:08:18,670
We can get off Ultron now, then we can just go storm.

3295
04:08:19,430 --> 04:08:19,690
Okay.

3296
04:08:21,110 --> 04:08:24,750
Here, uh, I'll let you swap the storm or do you not know how to play it?

3297
04:08:24,750 --> 04:08:25,650
No, you can play it.

3298
04:08:25,650 --> 04:08:26,090
I'll go.

3299
04:08:26,410 --> 04:08:26,690
All right.

3300
04:08:32,810 --> 04:08:33,770
All right.

3301
04:08:34,050 --> 04:08:34,490
Here we go.

3302
04:08:34,910 --> 04:08:40,190
Now that there's no dive, maybe it'd be like less scary.

3303
04:08:41,090 --> 04:08:42,630
Like, I got it.

3304
04:08:42,630 --> 04:08:43,590
Maybe it would be like less scary.

3305
04:08:43,630 --> 04:08:44,730
Here we go.

3306
04:08:46,670 --> 04:08:48,550
Maybe it would be less scary.

3307
04:08:49,570 --> 04:08:50,010
Like...

3308
04:08:50,470 --> 04:08:50,910
Anarchy.

3309
04:08:53,950 --> 04:08:54,690
There we go.

3310
04:08:54,810 --> 04:08:55,850
We save each other.

3311
04:08:55,990 --> 04:08:56,590
Look at that.

3312
04:08:57,070 --> 04:08:58,530
We babysit each other.

3313
04:09:00,330 --> 04:09:01,130
Let's go.

3314
04:09:01,730 --> 04:09:04,490
Yeah, whenever people do a triple tank, I just go to Thor.

3315
04:09:04,730 --> 04:09:05,830
I don't know why it works.

3316
04:09:06,630 --> 04:09:07,750
No, it doesn't work.

3317
04:09:11,570 --> 04:09:12,870
He's like, I don't know if it works.

3318
04:09:12,970 --> 04:09:14,310
And he's like, it doesn't work.

3319
04:09:15,670 --> 04:09:17,630
How dare you think it works?

3320
04:09:18,550 --> 04:09:20,550
It actually does not

3321
04:09:24,820 --> 04:09:29,540
Do I have okay, I do okay, I do thank God

3322
04:09:32,730 --> 04:09:40,550
Okay, there's no one to other This is bad

3323
04:09:46,370 --> 04:09:52,850
Oh my god, fuck, okay, this is this is like this is all there It's basically...

3324
04:09:52,850 --> 04:09:54,930
It's basically a support off.

3325
04:09:55,230 --> 04:09:56,050
It's a support off.

3326
04:09:56,370 --> 04:09:57,770
If you think it's a support off.

3327
04:09:58,550 --> 04:09:59,270
It's... Well, it works.

3328
04:09:59,430 --> 04:09:59,890
It works.

3329
04:10:00,290 --> 04:10:00,730
It works.

3330
04:10:04,010 --> 04:10:07,430
The thing is, Captain America's honor is also a support off.

3331
04:10:07,570 --> 04:10:08,150
It still works.

3332
04:10:08,650 --> 04:10:09,950
I didn't fuck up.

3333
04:10:13,930 --> 04:10:14,690
It's okay.

3334
04:10:14,970 --> 04:10:15,990
I didn't fuck up.

3335
04:10:16,310 --> 04:10:17,090
It's still...

3336
04:10:17,850 --> 04:10:18,530
It's still...

3337
04:10:18,530 --> 04:10:19,650
It's still supporting.

3338
04:10:20,130 --> 04:10:20,630
It's...

3339
04:10:23,890 --> 04:10:24,950
Massive play.

3340
04:10:25,710 --> 04:10:33,770
Yeah, I didn't fuck up because technically it's still a support It's Technically it still is

3341
04:10:43,180 --> 04:10:56,080
Like as long as it works Oh my god But I don't know how long I can be alive for it Okay.

3342
04:11:01,100 --> 04:11:02,080
It's fine.

3343
04:11:05,000 --> 04:11:06,000
It's fine.

3344
04:11:06,520 --> 04:11:11,260
Oh my god.

3349
04:11:26,260 --> 04:11:27,420
Please stop strafing.

3350
04:11:33,000 --> 04:11:33,600
Ok.

3351
04:11:36,580 --> 04:11:36,800
Alright.

3352
04:11:41,170 --> 04:11:44,930
I'll let the Luna off first.

3353
04:11:47,210 --> 04:11:51,090
Just in case!

3354
04:11:51,910 --> 04:11:52,430

3356
04:11:54,670 --> 04:11:58,470
Oh my God!

3357
04:11:59,350 --> 04:12:00,090
Where is he?

3358
04:12:00,870 --> 04:12:01,570
Just in case!

3359
04:12:03,770 --> 04:12:05,770

Just a whop, sorry.

3361
04:12:08,150 --> 04:12:09,450
I am so sorry.

3362
04:12:10,190 --> 04:12:14,070
I had to figure out how to protect you all.

3363
04:12:21,010 --> 04:12:21,710
Please.

3364
04:12:22,250 --> 04:12:23,410
He's one, please.

3365
04:12:25,610 --> 04:12:29,230
I tried so hard to protect everybody.

3366
04:12:30,030 --> 04:12:30,990
Oh my god.

3367
04:12:33,310 --> 04:12:33,710
It's okay.

3368
04:12:34,570 --> 04:12:35,290
We're alive.

3369
04:12:35,830 --> 04:12:36,670
We're alive.

3370
04:12:37,530 --> 04:12:38,670
We're alive.

3371
04:12:40,830 --> 04:12:43,350
I heard that moon and I got worried.

3372
04:12:46,350 --> 04:12:47,190
I still hit the ground.

3373
04:12:49,550 --> 04:12:51,310
Holy shit, what's going on over there?

3374
04:12:51,690 --> 04:12:54,790
Guys, what the fuck is going on over there though?

3375
04:12:55,910 --> 04:12:58,630
Okay, the only bad thing is that he's farming.

3376
04:12:59,590 --> 04:13:02,730
He's definitely farming all this right now.

3377
04:13:07,870 --> 04:13:08,390
Goodbye.

3378
04:13:13,270 --> 04:13:15,950
Okay, I am farming a lot of upcharge.

3379
04:13:19,010 --> 04:13:25,390
Okay, this is a little worrisome because they definitely have the moon and I'm...

3380
04:13:25,390 --> 04:13:26,430
Oh, poor dude.

3381
04:13:28,410 --> 04:13:29,130

04:13:29,770 --> 04:13:31,450
Okay, he...

Oh, please, please keep me up.

3385
04:13:38,570 --> 04:13:42,310
I mean, I guess it's an interesting play.

3386
04:13:49,970 --> 04:13:50,490
No!

3387
04:13:55,860 --> 04:13:59,300
Oh, that's so unfortunate.

3388
04:14:00,300 --> 04:14:01,220
That was nothing.

04:14:01,760 --> 04:14:03,860

my god.

3400
04:14:33,700 --> 04:14:35,180
Guys, I don't think we're going to win this.

3401
04:14:39,360 --> 04:14:41,120
Guys, I don't know.

3402
04:14:41,680 --> 04:14:42,100
I do.

3403
04:14:45,380 --> 04:14:48,460
Guys, it does not look so hopeful.

3404
04:14:49,020 --> 04:14:49,280
Again?

3405
04:14:53,930 --> 04:14:55,110
Guys, I have.

3406
04:14:55,130 --> 04:14:56,130
I had a feeling.

3407
04:14:56,390 --> 04:14:58,110
I had a feeling there.

3408
04:14:59,090 --> 04:14:59,810
How hard is Faka?

3409
04:15:02,670 --> 04:15:03,750
That was, yeah.

3410
04:15:04,430 --> 04:15:04,550
Again.

3411
04:15:07,310 --> 04:15:09,010
It's because we were all grouped up.

3412
04:15:09,450 --> 04:15:11,810
We were all grouped up together because it was last fight.

3413
04:15:12,090 --> 04:15:14,790
So he instantly got all after that.

3414
04:15:19,110 --> 04:15:23,310
I mean, the smart decision was to swap off Loki, but we needed their first healing.

3415
04:15:23,790 --> 04:15:24,590
That was the thing.

3416
04:15:27,270 --> 04:15:30,530
Like, I literally did 53- Jesus Christ.

3417
04:15:30,910 --> 04:15:35,610
I did 53k healing when we had triple support.

3418
04:15:36,190 --> 04:15:40,970
Guys, the enemy team did 47k healing with double support.

3419
04:15:41,370 --> 04:15:45,730
We had triple support and I still got 53k healing.

3420
04:15:46,290 --> 04:15:47,590
Holy fuck.

3421
04:15:50,130 --> 04:15:51,650
That's crazy.

3422
04:15:52,170 --> 04:15:56,530
Yeah, no, that- I was not- I was like...

3423
04:15:57,290 --> 04:15:58,990
I was not gonna live.

3424
04:16:01,210 --> 04:16:02,730
Wait, what did we want to watch?

3425
04:16:04,750 --> 04:16:06,610
It was something we wanted to watch.

3426
04:16:06,710 --> 04:16:08,530
What did we want to watch earlier?

3427
04:16:10,310 --> 04:16:12,030
Yeah, we were not winning that.

3428
04:16:12,410 --> 04:16:13,990
No, absolutely not.

3429
04:16:17,820 --> 04:16:18,320
No, no, no.

3430
04:16:18,320 --> 04:16:19,500
We wanted to watch something.

3431
04:16:20,300 --> 04:16:21,260
Oh, and Nam.

3432
04:16:21,480 --> 04:16:21,700
Yeah.

3433
04:16:22,200 --> 04:16:22,620
Sorry.

3434
04:16:22,880 --> 04:16:24,440
Now I have my PTSD there.

3435
04:16:25,300 --> 04:16:26,280
The PTSD came.

3436
04:16:28,640 --> 04:16:28,940
Okay.

3437
04:16:29,020 --> 04:16:29,720
Where was this?

3438
04:16:30,340 --> 04:16:31,140
Where was Nam?

3439
04:16:32,600 --> 04:16:34,720
It was right here.

3440
04:16:38,310 --> 04:16:38,930
Was it?

3441
04:16:40,150 --> 04:16:40,990
Or was it?

3442
04:16:41,830 --> 04:16:42,370
Or was it?

3443
04:16:43,150 --> 04:16:44,150
Was it this?

3444
04:16:44,970 --> 04:16:46,630
No, this was me dancing.

3445
04:16:47,070 --> 04:16:47,890
No, this was here!

3446
04:16:47,990 --> 04:16:48,570
This was Nam!

3447
04:16:53,820 --> 04:16:56,860
I mean, all they did was chase me down.

3448
04:17:01,270 --> 04:17:01,670
Okay.

3449
04:17:03,610 --> 04:17:04,770

Everyone got mad at him?

3456
04:17:48,890 --> 04:17:52,690
Wait, why would we get rid of Emma if they go dive?

3457
04:17:52,930 --> 04:17:54,550

Like, we don't have Pio now.

3466
04:19:12,850 --> 04:19:15,850
He was the one that chose Emma, too.

3467
04:19:18,090 --> 04:19:19,050

I trust him.

3470
04:19:24,570 --> 04:19:28,270
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

3471
04:19:28,870 --> 04:19:29,130
Got it?

3472
04:19:29,850 --> 04:19:31,650
Moon Knight and group combo.

3494
04:21:07,550 --> 04:21:08,430
I hope he doesn't die.

3495
04:21:09,810 --> 04:21:11,830

04:21:58,670 --> 04:22:01,690
You know, there's so many questions.

04:27:44,320 --> 04:27:45,480
I think it's literally GG.

3582
04:27:45,680 --> 04:27:47,480
I think this team is like...

3583
04:27:47,480 --> 04:27:49,160
Oh, this is where I died.

3584
04:27:49,360 --> 04:27:50,960
I think this team was just not meant to live.

3585
04:27:51,280 --> 04:27:54,400
I don't think this team was meant to win in any capacity.

3586
04:27:54,960 --> 04:27:55,260
I...

3587
04:27:57,540 --> 04:28:22,260
holy shit we all do brother I literally if I can poke one time I'm fucked like he wants me oh my god I'm I'm fucking oh my god um please please please come over

3588
04:28:27,730 --> 04:28:31,910
guys I don't I think it's literally a Team diff.

3589
04:28:32,850 --> 04:28:34,870
I think it's literally a team diff, guys.

3590
04:28:39,850 --> 04:28:41,770
No, this is absolutely a team diff.

3591
04:28:46,630 --> 04:28:47,190
Oh.

3592
04:28:49,690 --> 04:28:50,990
Oh my god.

3593
04:28:52,630 --> 04:28:53,790
Oh my goodness.

3594
04:29:01,110 --> 04:29:02,430
That's so unlucky.

3595
04:29:03,970 --> 04:29:06,470
No, this is a team diff right there.

3596
04:29:06,970 --> 04:29:08,550
No, this team is just better.

3597
04:29:10,850 --> 04:29:13,150
This team is actually just betting.

3598
04:29:14,690 --> 04:29:15,730
Yeah, that wasn't it.

3599
04:29:16,650 --> 04:29:17,550
That wasn't it.

3600
04:29:17,850 --> 04:29:20,950
Okay, I realize I'm at almost a five-hour mark.

3601
04:29:26,860 --> 04:29:32,500
Wooply told me to let him DPS and then sold on DPSs.

3602
04:29:33,200 --> 04:29:35,160
You see, the problem is he didn't let him tank.

3603
04:29:35,720 --> 04:29:36,780
That's the problem.

3604
04:29:41,470 --> 04:29:43,390
Oh, my other showcrest is Celestia.

3605
04:29:43,510 --> 04:29:44,890
I don't

3606
04:29:52,120 --> 04:30:17,140

3607
04:31:08,440 --> 04:31:11,520
I'm back I'm back I'm back.

3608
04:31:13,580 --> 04:31:13,820
It's okay.

3609
04:31:13,920 --> 04:31:17,640
I don't need to change it because I don't have to play Luna.

3610
04:31:23,170 --> 04:31:24,390
Alright, it's not an addiction.

3611
04:31:24,650 --> 04:31:25,230
It's a lifestyle.

3612
04:31:28,950 --> 04:31:29,790
Why should I do Loki?

3613
04:31:35,780 --> 04:31:36,180
Okay.

3614
04:31:36,800 --> 04:31:37,840
Alright, I'll play.

3615
04:31:39,960 --> 04:31:41,440
I'll play until the 5-hour mark.

3616
04:31:42,220 --> 04:31:43,520
And then I'll call it today.

3617
04:31:43,720 --> 04:31:45,100
Tomorrow's Battlefield 6!

3618
04:31:45,640 --> 04:31:46,040
Alright, guys.

3619
04:31:46,060 --> 04:31:47,140
Tomorrow's Battlefield 6.

3620
04:31:47,820 --> 04:31:49,180
Also, I wasn't supposed to play this now.

3621
04:31:49,200 --> 04:31:52,400
but I got carried away as always.

3622
04:31:52,740 --> 04:31:53,900
I don't know what it is about rank.

3623
04:31:54,060 --> 04:31:55,280
I can just play rank forever.

3624
04:31:56,460 --> 04:31:58,140
It's just a competitiveness of me.

3625
04:31:58,400 --> 04:31:59,540
I could literally just play this game.

3626
04:32:00,320 --> 04:32:07,200
I could play any competitive game forever, like for a very long time if I don't, if I don't, no one stops me.

3627
04:32:07,840 --> 04:32:10,020
If no one stops me, I could play tank.

3628
04:32:10,520 --> 04:32:11,900
I could play even longer.

3629
04:32:12,680 --> 04:32:13,760
Yo, Strange, you play tank?

3630
04:32:14,600 --> 04:32:18,900
You see the- Yeah, I actually bought this icon on wish.com.

3631
04:32:20,120 --> 04:32:22,860
Can we play strange like the entire game?

3632
04:32:23,600 --> 04:32:24,820
No, I'm gonna portal us.

3633
04:32:25,520 --> 04:32:28,920
I bought this icon on wish.com.

3634
04:32:28,920 --> 04:32:30,960
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

3635
04:32:31,300 --> 04:32:31,540
Got it?

3636
04:32:31,560 --> 04:32:32,700
Follow my portal?

3637
04:32:33,800 --> 04:32:36,800
Whoa, whoa, I'm body blocking.

3638
04:32:37,300 --> 04:32:38,320
My skinny eyes?

3639
04:32:39,440 --> 04:32:42,940
Look at you skinny ass twink body's gonna body block.

3640
04:32:46,160 --> 04:32:48,280
The perfect body block.

3641
04:32:48,800 --> 04:32:49,060
The perfect body block.

3642
04:32:51,540 --> 04:32:58,300
I don't know, I think if anybody in body blocks, it's definitely not the no key.

3643
04:32:59,060 --> 04:32:59,880
But I'll do it.

3644
04:33:00,460 --> 04:33:02,040
I'll do it for the team.

3645
04:33:03,640 --> 04:33:05,080
There you go down, come down.

3646
04:33:05,820 --> 04:33:06,560
You have to destroy now.

3647
04:33:07,180 --> 04:33:11,120
There you go.

3648
04:33:15,930 --> 04:33:17,110
I'm everywhere.

3649
04:33:18,170 --> 04:33:19,250
Invigorating, no.

3650
04:33:20,050 --> 04:33:21,470
Mine didn't hit me.

3651
04:33:21,470 --> 04:33:23,070
I accept this.

3652
04:33:23,110 --> 04:33:23,590
I accept this.

3653
04:33:23,590 --> 04:33:25,190
Oh, I fucked up.

3654
04:33:25,290 --> 04:33:26,230
I should not have done that.

3655
04:33:27,110 --> 04:33:41,250
I didn't think like you would know I'd be here Because I wanted to separate the supports a little bit because I can still heal ring Jesus Christ how much

3656
04:33:47,970 --> 04:33:54,210
Okay Okay, yeah, I had my ult first

3657
04:34:00,110 --> 04:34:02,090
Jesus Christ, I had to use that.

3658
04:34:07,570 --> 04:34:09,030
Please, kill him!

3659
04:34:09,570 --> 04:34:13,010
Oh my god, what is she doing here?

3660
04:34:15,290 --> 04:34:16,250
Kill him.

3661
04:34:17,510 --> 04:34:18,510
I live.

3662
04:34:22,750 --> 04:34:24,150
Okay, we have five alts.

3663
04:34:24,350 --> 04:34:26,250
I literally, we guaned that with just my alts.

3664
04:34:26,450 --> 04:34:26,790
Look at that.

3665
04:34:26,890 --> 04:34:27,390
I'm gaming.

3666
04:34:29,050 --> 04:34:30,650
And that's how you know.

3667
04:34:31,530 --> 04:34:32,050
gaming.

3668
04:34:33,370 --> 04:34:33,590
Yippee!

3669
04:34:34,190 --> 04:34:34,890
I'm gaming.

3670
04:34:36,010 --> 04:34:36,910
We got this.

3671
04:34:37,610 --> 04:34:39,550
I'm not healing anybody right now.

3672
04:34:40,050 --> 04:34:41,110
But I am gaming.

3673
04:34:42,190 --> 04:34:43,870
She is in fact sire gaming.

3674
04:34:45,930 --> 04:34:46,950
She'll be fine, right?

3675
04:34:51,700 --> 04:34:52,820
Oh wait, he's won.

3676
04:34:53,180 --> 04:34:54,500
Okay, that was embarrassing.

3677
04:34:58,780 --> 04:34:59,900
All right, don't worry, we got this.

3678
04:35:01,560 --> 04:35:02,780
That's how you know.

3679
04:35:05,780 --> 04:35:09,160
Okay, I need a note to remember to set these guys up in high ground.

3680
04:35:10,420 --> 04:35:11,740
I already have an almost another ult.

3681
04:35:12,020 --> 04:35:12,180
Nice.

3682
04:35:16,120 --> 04:35:18,720
Okay, he's gonna have some wild shit.

3683
04:35:22,620 --> 04:35:23,720
I was gonna press shift.

3684
04:35:24,160 --> 04:35:25,980
I literally pressed shift too.

3685
04:35:26,240 --> 04:35:27,980
I'm so sad.

3686
04:35:28,780 --> 04:35:30,120
I'm so sad.

3687
04:35:30,840 --> 04:35:32,640
I had shift.

3688
04:35:33,020 --> 04:35:34,020
I had shift.

3689
04:35:34,240 --> 04:35:35,420
I'm so sad.

3690
04:35:35,820 --> 04:35:37,220
I'm so sad.

3691
04:35:38,420 --> 04:35:39,180
Wait, we did it.

3692
04:35:39,340 --> 04:35:40,640
Yeah, I'm not sad anymore.

3693
04:35:40,820 --> 04:35:42,240
I'm not sad anymore.

3694
04:35:42,560 --> 04:35:43,200
We did it.

3695
04:35:45,480 --> 04:35:46,320

3696
04:35:46,320 --> 04:35:46,740

3697
04:35:46,840 --> 04:35:47,340
We kill her.

3698
04:35:48,060 --> 04:35:48,520
Yippee.

3699
04:35:48,860 --> 04:35:49,720
No longer sad.

It's sad God.

3703
04:36:00,580 --> 04:36:01,760
It's just that easy.

3704
04:36:02,120 --> 04:36:02,520
Depression cured.

3705
04:36:04,960 --> 04:36:07,300
You know how they're like, well, how are you sad?

3706
04:36:07,460 --> 04:36:08,340
Just stop being sad.

3707
04:36:08,600 --> 04:36:09,260
That's what they mean.

3708
04:36:09,720 --> 04:36:10,680
That's how...

3709
04:36:10,680 --> 04:36:11,940
Guys, please!

3710
04:36:12,860 --> 04:36:13,520

04:36:14,200 --> 04:36:15,160
I'm pointy.

3712
04:36:15,160 --> 04:36:19,240
Get out of here.

3713
04:36:21,720 --> 04:36:23,120
I don't need help.

3714
04:36:23,980 --> 04:36:25,440
I cured depression.

3715
04:36:29,880 --> 04:36:31,720
Can he like...

3716
04:36:31,720 --> 04:36:32,900
Can he save him?

3717
04:36:33,280 --> 04:36:34,080
I don't know.

3718
04:36:34,240 --> 04:36:37,900
All right,

3719
04:36:42,440 --> 04:36:43,240
I'm ready to put on a show.

3720
04:36:44,220 --> 04:36:44,960
I'm ready.

3721
04:36:46,060 --> 04:36:47,720
What the fuck?

3722
04:36:48,000 --> 04:36:49,020
I'm so ready.

3723
04:36:51,320 --> 04:36:52,240
There we go.

3724
04:36:53,840 --> 04:36:54,880

04:36:58,790 --> 04:36:59,890
Okay, wait, what?

3726
04:37:01,270 --> 04:37:02,710

Don't worry.

3729
04:37:08,030 --> 04:37:09,890
Okay, who cares about whooply, though?

3730
04:37:11,090 --> 04:37:13,420
Did he do it?

3731
04:37:18,150 --> 04:37:20,030
Focus on him?

3732
04:37:20,230 --> 04:37:20,940
There we go.

3733
04:37:24,670 --> 04:37:25,250
Oh, it's Hawk.

3734
04:37:25,650 --> 04:37:26,470
Hawk time.

3735
04:37:27,590 --> 04:37:28,990
Oh, my God.

3736
04:37:32,790 --> 04:37:34,990
He got deleted.

3737
04:37:36,050 --> 04:37:37,650
We needed this game.

3738
04:37:39,250 --> 04:37:40,210
We needed this game.

3739
04:37:41,170 --> 04:37:41,830
He disappeared.

3740
04:37:41,990 --> 04:37:44,690
Yeah, I was like, where did he go?

3741
04:37:47,830 --> 04:37:48,730
Actually shredded.

3742
04:37:53,550 --> 04:37:55,530
Yeah, the portal cut off all the supports.

3743
04:37:56,250 --> 04:37:56,910
That's right, guys.

3744
04:37:57,130 --> 04:37:57,630
I'm a hero.

3745
04:38:00,870 --> 04:38:02,250
The skinniest boy here.

04:38:02,390 --> 04:38:03,350
Here the body block.

3747
04:38:10,520 --> 04:38:11,200

That's right.

3749
04:38:13,600 --> 04:38:16,160
That's how I got one above us.

3750
04:38:17,060 --> 04:38:17,580
Yippee.

3751
04:38:19,820 --> 04:38:23,320

Okay.

3753
04:38:29,280 --> 04:38:31,500
Okay, but you guys can't lie.

3754
04:38:31,980 --> 04:38:34,040
Loki was around a lot.

3755
04:38:35,800 --> 04:38:37,040
He knew what he wanted.

3756
04:38:39,180 --> 04:38:39,660

04:39:29,490 --> 04:39:30,590
A wild twink.

3762
04:39:36,830 --> 04:39:39,390

3763
04:39:40,030 --> 04:39:40,550

Things seem very fine.

3765
04:39:47,750 --> 04:39:49,250

It's okay.

3780
04:40:36,310 --> 04:40:37,470
He died for the cause.

3781
04:40:38,290 --> 04:40:38,730
No, no.

3782
04:40:40,170 --> 04:40:41,790

04:42:59,730 --> 04:43:00,250
He's okay.

3801
04:43:00,990 --> 04:43:03,290
Do you think Luna is alive?

3802
04:43:05,610 --> 04:43:08,210
You think it's okay, he's okay.

3803
04:43:12,830 --> 04:43:13,930

04:43:58,010 --> 04:43:58,730
Oh, that's unlucky.

3808
04:43:58,930 --> 04:43:59,770
He's not alive anymore.

3809
04:44:00,370 --> 04:44:01,330
Wait, we still have Luna.

3810
04:44:01,850 --> 04:44:03,190
Bro, what are you saving it for?

3811
04:44:04,130 --> 04:44:04,670
We can back up.

3812
04:44:05,650 --> 04:44:07,610
We can touch with two support goals.

3813
04:44:12,810 --> 04:44:13,650
Jesus Christ.

3814
04:44:13,950 --> 04:44:15,570
Okay, use it for the most...

3815
04:44:19,570 --> 04:44:20,330
Okay, nice.

3816
04:44:20,730 --> 04:44:23,970
I was going to say, use it the moment I actually have.

3817
04:44:29,680 --> 04:44:31,000
You're alive!

3818
04:44:31,940 --> 04:44:33,360
You're alive!

3819
04:44:34,860 --> 04:44:35,220
Okay.

3820
04:44:36,060 --> 04:44:38,320
Okay, maybe I shouldn't have used that.

3821
04:44:38,860 --> 04:44:40,240
But I saved her.

3822
04:44:40,740 --> 04:44:42,300
I saved her, though.

3823
04:44:42,740 --> 04:44:44,620
I saved her.

3824
04:44:44,980 --> 04:44:45,360
I...

3825
04:44:46,240 --> 04:44:48,180
I saved her!

3826
04:44:48,560 --> 04:44:49,360
I saved her!

3827
04:44:51,420 --> 04:44:52,020
Whoa, got the arrow.

3828
04:44:52,020 --> 04:44:53,800
Wait, wait, have no support holes, I think.

3829
04:44:53,900 --> 04:44:55,480
I, I'm a hero!

3830
04:44:58,840 --> 04:45:00,960
Remember what I did!

3831
04:45:03,240 --> 04:45:03,800
That's awkward.

3832
04:45:06,460 --> 04:45:07,420
She's alive.

3833
04:45:08,340 --> 04:45:09,580
She appreciates it.

3834
04:45:10,280 --> 04:45:12,100
We're gonna get bubbles too, so I...

3835
04:45:12,100 --> 04:45:15,500
I am ready to put on a show!

3836
04:45:16,300 --> 04:45:16,920
That's fine, that's fine.

3837
04:45:17,200 --> 04:45:17,480
Just burst.

3838
04:45:20,380 --> 04:45:21,340
Jesus Christ.

3839
04:45:21,420 --> 04:45:23,280
Okay, I need a backup though.

3840
04:45:23,300 --> 04:45:26,420
I need a backup of this.

3841
04:45:34,100 --> 04:45:35,180
That's awkward.

3842
04:45:36,160 --> 04:45:37,060
That's whoa!

3843
04:45:40,320 --> 04:45:41,220
It's okay.

3844
04:45:44,400 --> 04:45:44,580
Whoa.

3845
04:45:51,420 --> 04:45:52,080
We are looking.

3846
04:45:52,800 --> 04:45:53,600
We are looking.

3847
04:45:53,620 --> 04:45:54,040
We do!

3848
04:45:54,800 --> 04:45:55,920
Get in here!

3849
04:45:58,640 --> 04:45:59,920
Okay, um...

3850
04:45:59,920 --> 04:46:00,280
Oh,

3851
04:46:04,500 --> 04:46:05,240
hey guys!

3852
04:46:05,840 --> 04:46:06,620
Hey guys!

3853
04:46:07,740 --> 04:46:07,740
Hey

3854
04:46:11,510 --> 04:46:13,390
guys!

3855
04:46:13,750 --> 04:46:15,670
Why did we all leave me alone?

3856
04:46:16,210 --> 04:46:17,330
On the point!

3857
04:46:18,750 --> 04:46:19,930
Why did you all leave?

3858
04:46:20,790 --> 04:46:22,130
Why did you all leave?

3859
04:46:22,830 --> 04:46:23,330
Guys!

3860
04:46:23,330 --> 04:46:26,330
Why did you all leave me?

3861
04:46:28,190 --> 04:46:30,410
I was not expecting that.

3862
04:46:32,050 --> 04:46:33,730
I was just like, hello, everybody.

3863
04:46:36,510 --> 04:46:37,790
We can't.

3864
04:46:38,650 --> 04:46:39,730
I think we win this.

3865
04:46:40,270 --> 04:46:42,250
I think they chased the fish.

3866
04:46:43,670 --> 04:46:45,430
Yeah, I was just like, hey guys.

3867
04:46:46,370 --> 04:46:46,530
Nice.

3868
04:46:49,930 --> 04:46:50,730
See that.

3869
04:46:50,810 --> 04:46:53,310
Sometimes you get to throw this down.

3870
04:46:54,030 --> 04:46:55,730
Where'd everybody go?

3871
04:46:57,490 --> 04:47:05,210
We picked up everybody, but Tokyo's just, I just saw my other two teammates just walk the way for the jump.

3872
04:47:05,410 --> 04:47:13,510
I was like, guys, guys, you're still, guys, five other people are going to, look, we're going to beat me up, guys.

3873
04:47:16,910 --> 04:47:19,270
Oh yeah, change the sound effect.

3874
04:47:19,450 --> 04:47:20,030
You're right, you're right.

3875

3876
04:47:57,000 --> 04:47:57,960
Refused to switch.

3877
04:47:59,340 --> 04:48:00,380
We're bad in our character.

3878
04:48:00,660 --> 04:48:01,900
That'll be the best part.

3879
04:48:06,980 --> 04:48:08,360
I mean, he's gonna go with Luna.

3880
04:48:09,880 --> 04:48:10,840
Alright, Omega.

3881
04:48:14,900 --> 04:48:15,340
Johnny!

3882
04:48:17,880 --> 04:48:19,420
Get him out of my game!

3883
04:48:19,900 --> 04:48:20,980
Nobody likes you.

3884
04:48:21,120 --> 04:48:22,280
That's why you die.

3885
04:48:24,280 --> 04:48:26,120
And Spider-Man took your place.

3886
04:48:27,540 --> 04:48:29,300
That's why I said it.

3887
04:48:35,530 --> 04:48:36,370
Spoilers.

3888
04:48:36,510 --> 04:48:38,910
It's literally in like the Marvel Rivals intro.

3889
04:48:42,610 --> 04:48:44,230
But came back.

3890
04:48:44,490 --> 04:48:46,550
Nobody actually dies, dies.

3891
04:48:46,850 --> 04:48:48,630
In any superhero universe.

3892
04:48:50,630 --> 04:48:50,830
Oh.

3893
04:48:53,010 --> 04:48:54,070
Mining cleaner.

3894
04:48:54,790 --> 04:48:55,730
What's called Punisher?

3895
04:48:58,250 --> 04:48:58,830
All right, fine.

3896
04:48:59,210 --> 04:48:59,670
Go.

3897
04:49:01,690 --> 04:49:03,490
Okay, well, that was not exhibited.

3898
04:49:06,030 --> 04:49:08,290
This guy didn't even mention fucking Phoenix.

3899
04:49:10,750 --> 04:49:11,150
All right.

3900
04:49:12,270 --> 04:49:12,570
Yeah.

3901
04:49:13,550 --> 04:49:14,170
Poor villain.

3902
04:49:14,550 --> 04:49:15,070
I'm not judging.

3903
04:49:15,190 --> 04:49:16,230
I don't mind going up against a group.

3904
04:49:16,330 --> 04:49:18,010
I can charge my beam off his walls.

3905
04:49:20,730 --> 04:49:21,350
Except for...

3906
04:49:21,350 --> 04:49:21,950
No, no.

3907
04:49:22,070 --> 04:49:23,130
Batman brought the math.

3908
04:49:23,290 --> 04:49:28,230
There's actually a story where Batman...

3909
04:49:28,250 --> 04:50:31,430

3911
04:50:49,530 --> 04:50:51,930
Happy is a very subjective raid.

3912
04:50:52,510 --> 04:51:01,180
Get over here.

3913
04:51:01,660 --> 04:51:02,380
Get over here.

3914
04:51:03,480 --> 04:51:03,980
There he is.

3915
04:51:04,940 --> 04:51:05,380
I'm gonna die.

3916
04:51:07,560 --> 04:51:08,880
I'm gonna die.

3917
04:51:09,220 --> 04:51:09,610
I'm gonna die.

3918
04:51:10,340 --> 04:51:11,020
But I'm in the back.

3919
04:51:14,660 --> 04:51:15,280
Left.

3920
04:51:19,320 --> 04:51:19,640
Oh!

3921
04:51:19,640 --> 04:51:19,800
Oh!

3922
04:51:20,220 --> 04:51:20,280
Oh!

3923
04:51:25,180 --> 04:51:30,700
We lost we lost Loki Were you though?

3924
04:51:31,580 --> 04:51:33,480
Were you actually healing me?

3925
04:51:34,560 --> 04:51:38,140
Oh my god, they can't hit their shots Were you though?

3926
04:51:38,320 --> 04:51:42,220
I can't get my fucking ship back up Why are you looking for a little?

3927
04:51:42,800 --> 04:51:48,080
They love it, try to make it Likely storm Oh

3928
04:51:51,180 --> 04:51:52,280
Uh, don't waste anything around.

3929
04:51:52,360 --> 04:51:52,780
They already cut.

3930
04:51:52,820 --> 04:51:53,520
Yeah, I'm not wasting them.

3931
04:51:53,720 --> 04:51:54,020
I'm wasting them.

3932
04:51:54,660 --> 04:51:54,660
I'm running.

3933
04:51:55,920 --> 04:51:57,600
I didn't even know.

3934
04:51:59,180 --> 04:51:59,580
Bolliter!

3935
04:52:02,530 --> 04:52:04,190
Okay, we can all let that be happening.

3936
04:52:05,030 --> 04:52:05,570
Why are we healing?

3937
04:52:05,650 --> 04:52:06,610
I can hold it.

3938
04:52:06,690 --> 04:52:08,370
I was healing him for the last second.

3939
04:52:09,030 --> 04:52:09,430
No!

3940
04:52:09,650 --> 04:52:10,610
No, you were not!

3941
04:52:12,710 --> 04:52:13,530
You were not.

3942
04:52:13,570 --> 04:52:15,130
You were not healing me on the last thing.

3943
04:52:15,230 --> 04:52:15,690
You were not.

3944
04:52:15,950 --> 04:52:16,430
You were not.

3945
04:52:16,570 --> 04:52:17,890
I looked at the replay!

3946
04:52:18,450 --> 04:52:19,690
I looked at replay!

3947
04:52:22,550 --> 04:52:23,670
Yeah, you were blocked.

3948
04:52:24,330 --> 04:52:25,830
I looked at replay.

3949
04:52:27,230 --> 04:52:29,050
I refused to play.

3950
04:52:29,090 --> 04:52:29,350
Pick and pick.

3951
04:52:31,570 --> 04:52:33,010
I looked at replay.

3952
04:52:34,510 --> 04:52:41,180
Oh no.

3953
04:52:43,220 --> 04:52:45,180
Oh no, I couldn't copy.

3954
04:52:46,280 --> 04:52:51,140
I got both supports.

3955
04:52:51,320 --> 04:52:52,600
Oh, we got no.

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on!

3959
04:53:33,820 --> 04:53:35,920
Oh my god!

3960
04:53:36,640 --> 04:53:37,360
Please!

3961
04:53:38,440 --> 04:53:40,140
I'm going to sue after this.

3962
04:53:42,880 --> 04:53:44,640
Oh my god, okay.

3963
04:53:45,640 --> 04:53:46,640
There's nothing I could do.

3964
04:53:48,000 --> 04:53:49,920
I'm going to...

3965
04:53:50,500 --> 04:53:52,280
I'm not going low key for this.

3966
04:53:58,970 --> 04:54:01,390
I can't, I can't survive.

3967
04:54:02,470 --> 04:54:06,190
Bro, we don't, can you go cloak or do you want my Luna?

3968
04:54:07,970 --> 04:54:08,650
What do I mean?

3969
04:54:09,130 --> 04:54:12,210
Luna cloak, Luna Sue is counter dive.

3970
04:54:12,930 --> 04:54:13,790
Does someone no more?

3971
04:54:13,990 --> 04:54:15,230
I can, I'm just not that good.

3972
04:54:15,230 --> 04:54:15,450
I don't know.

3973
04:54:15,610 --> 04:54:16,670
We don't need to, bro.

3974
04:54:16,770 --> 04:54:17,390
We don't need to.

3975
04:54:17,650 --> 04:54:21,090
Like, I'm just with the Loki, but the Loki was always trying to run away from it.

3976
04:54:21,530 --> 04:54:23,030
What do you mean?

3977
04:54:23,250 --> 04:54:25,170
I'll try to comment a little bit more and I'll protect them.

3978
04:54:25,610 --> 04:54:27,450
I was in front of you!

3979
04:54:28,550 --> 04:54:56,010
not your fault not your fault it's just every time i tried to come back and heal you you would walk the opposite way what that is a lie i was literally bro is lying bro is lying we all saw what's going up bro is actually lying on vc oh my god that doesn't make sense bro is lying on stream That's actually...

3980
04:54:56,010 --> 04:54:59,290
Should I give him until I can't afford to walk away?

3981
04:54:59,850 --> 04:55:01,650
We actually saw him!

3982
04:55:02,110 --> 04:55:03,850
I would run to him!

3983
04:55:03,890 --> 04:55:05,630
I was in front of him!

3984
04:55:06,050 --> 04:55:06,450
Bro!

3985
04:55:06,950 --> 04:55:07,490
What do you mean?

3986
04:55:07,570 --> 04:55:09,350
I would run away!

3987
04:55:09,690 --> 04:55:10,070
Look at him!

3988
04:55:10,630 --> 04:55:11,110
Look at him!

3989
04:55:11,230 --> 04:55:11,330
Look at him!

3990
04:55:11,790 --> 04:55:13,590
That's actually...

3991
04:55:15,450 --> 04:55:16,270
That's crazy.

3992
04:55:20,550 --> 04:55:21,110
That's crazy.

3993
04:55:23,590 --> 04:55:25,930
That's actually crazy.

3994
04:55:26,510 --> 04:55:27,070
Look at that.

3995
04:55:29,710 --> 04:55:32,890
That's just saying that I was running away from him.

3996
04:55:34,230 --> 04:55:35,390
I was in front of him.

3997
04:55:35,410 --> 04:55:37,590
How would I run away?

3998
04:55:44,990 --> 04:55:46,270
That's crazy.

3999
04:55:47,950 --> 04:55:50,110
We all saw it too, right?

4000
04:55:50,370 --> 04:55:52,070
I don't know what he's talking about.

4001
04:55:52,450 --> 04:55:53,510
We all saw it.

4002
04:55:53,590 --> 04:55:56,070
him not kill me in front of me?

4003
04:55:56,630 --> 04:55:58,810
How would I run away?

4004
04:55:59,230 --> 04:56:01,070
We go topside, let's just go topside, go top.

4005
04:56:01,070 --> 04:56:02,530
I'm not fighting, I'm not fighting this fucking time.

4006
04:56:02,650 --> 04:56:03,230
I just fell off.

4007
04:56:03,630 --> 04:56:04,650
Topside, topside, topside.

4008
04:56:08,230 --> 04:56:10,770
Why would you be by yourselves right now?

4009
04:56:12,810 --> 04:56:15,150
We all saw it on 4K.

4010
04:56:15,550 --> 04:56:15,970
It's fine.

4011
04:56:16,670 --> 04:56:18,170
Well, yeah, I mean, we all disappeared.

4012
04:56:18,770 --> 04:56:19,930
They're moving now.

4013
04:56:21,610 --> 04:56:22,850
It's actually crazy.

4014
04:56:23,730 --> 04:56:26,350
He was like, you're running away from me.

4015
04:56:26,530 --> 04:56:27,270
I'm like, how?

4016
04:56:27,910 --> 04:56:29,830
How do I run away?

4017
04:56:35,670 --> 04:56:37,490
Oh my god.

4018
04:56:37,670 --> 04:56:38,830
Oh my god.

4019
04:56:39,110 --> 04:56:39,610
Oh my god.

4020
04:56:41,690 --> 04:56:44,450
Well, uh, there's no accommodation at this point.

4021
04:56:46,190 --> 04:56:47,570
I won't disappear so easily.

4022
04:56:48,550 --> 04:56:52,430
Because I was like, I didn't see it because I was playing viral rather.

4023
04:56:57,770 --> 04:56:59,470
That's actually crazy.

4024
04:57:01,630 --> 04:57:04,090
I'm pretty sure it's just a team diff.

4025
04:57:05,490 --> 04:57:07,170
That is definitely a team diff.

4026
04:57:08,430 --> 04:57:11,390
Like he just watched he needs to watch the fucking replay.

4027
04:57:12,390 --> 04:57:14,730
I should have went invisible too.

4028
04:57:16,410 --> 04:57:18,670
Don't mess with the amazing spider!

4029
04:57:18,930 --> 04:57:20,150
I don't know.

4030
04:57:20,410 --> 04:57:21,210
Okay, we're gonna go.

4031
04:57:22,130 --> 04:57:23,410
Clearly you needed some help.

4032
04:57:24,050 --> 04:57:25,190
I have blue now, I have blue now.

4033
04:57:25,430 --> 04:57:25,930
I'm walking.

4034
04:57:27,770 --> 04:57:28,310
Touch.

4035
04:57:32,170 --> 04:57:33,870
It must have one point, it must one.

4036
04:57:36,570 --> 04:57:38,990
There's somebody behind me.

4037
04:57:39,590 --> 04:57:40,950
He's behind me, isn't he?

4038
04:57:43,950 --> 04:57:46,010
He's behind me, isn't he?

4039
04:57:52,140 --> 04:57:53,260
Oh my god.

4040
04:57:54,060 --> 04:57:57,410
On the left side.

4041
04:57:59,050 --> 04:57:59,270
Okay.

4042
04:58:05,130 --> 04:58:06,010
That's unfortunate.

4043
04:58:07,730 --> 04:58:10,450
I don't want to use my jump though, that's the thing.

4044
04:58:15,820 --> 04:58:17,400
I don't want to use my jump.

4045
04:58:21,620 --> 04:58:23,400
Oh, I'm so scared.

4046
04:58:30,090 --> 04:58:31,630
Oh my, get out of here!

4047
04:58:31,810 --> 04:58:32,610
Get out of here!

4048
04:58:35,330 --> 04:58:38,030
I can't jump, I can't jump, I can't jump, I...

4049
04:58:38,030 --> 04:58:38,990
There's nothing I could do.

4050
04:58:39,030 --> 04:58:40,710
Look at Luna, look at Luna, look at Luna.

4051
04:58:41,570 --> 04:58:44,590
Six seconds, five, four, three.

4052
04:58:44,610 --> 04:58:45,610
for sure we have one

4053
04:58:54,910 --> 04:58:56,250
Okay, that's fine.

4054
04:58:56,910 --> 04:58:58,950
We have to use this to live the hell out

4055
04:59:04,630 --> 04:59:17,970
Okay, we live we stacked We stacked see this is what you mean you gotta trust the process you have to stack when you're getting alted.

4056
04:59:18,130 --> 04:59:19,110
You don't run away.

4057
04:59:20,670 --> 04:59:22,730
You have to trust the process.

4058
04:59:25,730 --> 04:59:26,370
They're not strange.

4059
04:59:26,510 --> 04:59:27,110
They're not teleporting.

4060
04:59:27,510 --> 04:59:28,170
Yeah, sure.

4061
04:59:28,910 --> 04:59:32,810
Okay, I'm going to try and let the rocket heal because we need, okay, we got it.

4062
04:59:33,390 --> 04:59:35,770
Okay, I was worried that probably going to be on the top of the board, though.

4063
04:59:36,410 --> 04:59:36,950
I have my ult to go.

4064
04:59:37,170 --> 04:59:38,030
Can you get it?

4065
04:59:39,410 --> 04:59:40,390
Oh my god, wooply, dooply.

4066
04:59:40,590 --> 04:59:41,550
I won't lose ult to you, man.

4067
04:59:44,750 --> 04:59:45,470

Okay.

4075
05:02:59,170 --> 05:03:02,710
Oh my god, technically we have four support outs if you think about it.

4076
05:03:03,730 --> 05:03:06,330
If you think about it, it's technically four support outs.

4077
05:03:09,410 --> 05:03:11,630
Am I healing anybody?

4078
05:03:14,050 --> 05:03:17,890
Is anybody getting healed right now?

4079
05:03:20,490 --> 05:03:21,730
Reach out of the fight for a bit.

4080
05:03:24,050 --> 05:04:01,960
yeah look at the look at the rocket oh no guys I don't think it's winnable anymore yeah I should have swapped off but I can't swap off anymore I can swap off Loki no actually no they're on bucky uh i have ulti for this fight if we can definitely touch so we're gonna make it back up

4081
05:04:06,060 --> 05:04:11,160
oh i think that was a good combo

4082
05:04:16,800 --> 05:04:26,900
that's crazy i don't even know tp It's gonna end soon.

4083
05:04:29,220 --> 05:04:30,020
Nice pick.

4084
05:04:30,640 --> 05:04:32,100
I'm still touching, I'm still touching, I'm still touching.

4085
05:04:32,600 --> 05:04:32,940
We're here.

4086
05:04:33,560 --> 05:04:35,720
There you go.

4087
05:04:35,820 --> 05:04:37,800
Bucky on the right, Bucky on the right.

4088
05:04:41,140 --> 05:04:42,320
I'm a half, I'm a half, I'm gonna put it.

4089
05:04:42,580 --> 05:04:42,860
Okay.

4090
05:04:43,960 --> 05:04:46,020
This is a little scary.

4091
05:04:49,140 --> 05:04:51,160
This is a little scary.

4092
05:04:52,040 --> 05:04:52,700
There's one as well.

4093
05:04:53,300 --> 05:04:53,720
Okay.

4095
05:05:26,020 --> 05:05:26,820
He's looking like he wants to.

4096
05:05:27,220 --> 05:05:27,680
No, no, no.

4097
05:05:27,780 --> 05:05:27,980
He doesn't.

4098
05:05:28,080 --> 05:05:28,460
He just needs to.

4099
05:05:28,580 --> 05:05:30,100
Do one, do one, do one, do one.

4100
05:05:48,220 --> 05:05:49,400

4101
05:05:50,260 --> 05:05:53,480

4110
05:06:14,540 --> 05:06:16,100
Was it good?

4111
05:06:16,140 --> 05:06:17,860
Turn on me, turn on me.

05:06:18,740 --> 05:06:19,700

4115
05:06:24,500 --> 05:06:25,540
Spider-Man could help or anything.

4116
05:06:28,040 --> 05:06:30,250
You'll have to keep fighting until we have a winner

4117

Oh, hello.

4121
05:07:13,670 --> 05:07:14,590

4122
05:07:15,150 --> 05:07:15,910
We can't get off point.

4123
05:07:19,510 --> 05:07:21,130
He actually can't get off point.

4124
05:07:21,830 --> 05:07:22,770
Are you serious?

4125
05:07:25,510 --> 05:07:26,510
I don't know.

4126
05:07:27,090 --> 05:07:28,550
There's two tanks in the back line.

4127
05:07:29,450 --> 05:07:30,590
Oh my god.

4128
05:07:30,850 --> 05:07:31,910
There's nothing I could do.

4129
05:07:33,230 --> 05:07:33,750
No!

4130
05:07:34,750 --> 05:07:36,110
Fuck it didn't matter.

4131
05:07:36,770 --> 05:07:37,930
Oh my god.

4132
05:07:40,130 --> 05:07:44,690
Literally, I come back just to get fucking harassed.

4133
05:07:47,390 --> 05:07:51,230
I come back just to get non-stop harassed.

4134
05:07:52,270 --> 05:07:53,170
Every time.

4135
05:07:53,690 --> 05:07:54,670
Every time.

05:08:05,080 --> 05:08:06,460
Okay, next game is last.

4139
05:08:06,580 --> 05:08:07,600
It was the Lunar's fault.

4140
05:08:08,020 --> 05:08:12,320
The Lunar, it was the Lunar for lying in front of everybody.

4141
05:08:13,900 --> 05:08:14,560
I do.

4142
05:08:14,880 --> 05:08:17,440

05:08:27,930 --> 05:08:29,570
You can't end on a loss.

4147
05:08:29,790 --> 05:08:30,190
That's right.

4148
05:08:30,330 --> 05:08:32,290
That's why this next one is my last.

4149
05:08:33,210 --> 05:08:34,230
Can't believe it.

4150
05:08:34,330 --> 05:08:37,290

05:15:27,660 --> 05:15:28,580
Gross A.

4226
05:15:29,520 --> 05:15:32,280
Never be a hero.

4227
05:15:37,740 --> 05:15:40,640
Just like the movie.

4228
05:15:42,540 --> 05:15:44,460
I literally...

4229
05:15:44,460 --> 05:15:45,500
God of lies.

4230
05:15:46,120 --> 05:15:46,780
If you wish.

4231
05:15:47,380 --> 05:15:48,120
What society?

4233
05:15:54,700 --> 05:15:58,300
I saved myself and I saved the cloak and I still die.

4234
05:15:58,660 --> 05:15:59,440
There's no karma.

4235
05:15:59,860 --> 05:16:00,920
Karma doesn't exist.

4236
05:16:01,620 --> 05:16:02,060
I...

4237
05:16:05,500 --> 05:16:09,820
I laid you on your back last game, little pup.

4238
05:16:12,660 --> 05:16:14,080
Pay the bottom.

4239
05:16:15,020 --> 05:16:16,820
You couldn't have barked yet.

4240
05:16:16,860 --> 05:16:17,760
I asked you.

4241
05:16:18,160 --> 05:16:20,740
You gotta do that for me, be the bottom.

4242
05:16:21,180 --> 05:16:24,400
I laid you on your back last game, little pup.

4243
05:16:25,000 --> 05:16:26,460
Go ahead and bark.

4244
05:16:33,240 --> 05:16:36,840
What is, what the hell is going on?

4245
05:16:42,570 --> 05:16:44,090
That's crazy.

4246
05:16:44,990 --> 05:16:47,430

4250
05:17:39,470 --> 05:17:41,390
Are they fighting or flirting?

4251
05:17:44,370 --> 05:17:45,410
It's Marble Rat.

4252
05:17:45,490 --> 05:17:47,710
Oh, that's...

4253
05:17:47,710 --> 05:17:48,910
You think...

05:17:48,910 --> 05:17:50,170
You think he's okay?

4255
05:17:51,510 --> 05:17:51,930
It's okay.

4256
05:17:52,070 --> 05:17:53,830
We have our little clones.

4257
05:17:55,390 --> 05:17:59,210
If we save each other, it would be fine.

4258
05:18:04,210 --> 05:18:05,190
Okay, it's fine.

4259
05:18:05,990 --> 05:18:06,670
It's okay.

4260
05:18:08,870 --> 05:18:09,610
It's okay.

4261
05:18:10,430 --> 05:18:10,950
It's okay.

4262
05:18:12,470 --> 05:18:13,250
Please look at me.

4263
05:18:13,930 --> 05:18:14,590
Please look at me.

4264
05:18:15,150 --> 05:18:16,310
Wait, we lost the control.

4265
05:18:17,090 --> 05:18:17,850
But look at me, please.

4266
05:18:18,590 --> 05:18:19,950
Oh my god, we live.

4267
05:18:23,460 --> 05:18:23,940
Okay.

4268
05:18:25,160 --> 05:18:25,900

05:19:37,170 --> 05:19:41,290

05:19:43,090 --> 05:19:43,790

Final strain.

Jesus Christ.

I'm up to two more.

4314
05:21:35,970 --> 05:21:37,230
You're not a higher rank.

4315
05:21:37,450 --> 05:21:40,210
You're clearly not good at all.

4316
05:21:40,850 --> 05:21:42,230
Not on an alt account.

4317
05:21:42,630 --> 05:21:43,050
Stop yapping.

4318
05:21:43,190 --> 05:21:43,730
You're terrible.

Oh my god.

4323
05:21:55,570 --> 05:21:56,750
This is why I don't do rank.

4324
05:21:56,830 --> 05:21:58,590
This is why you live vicariously through me.

That's okay.

4328
05:22:32,670 --> 05:22:34,010
Everybody peeks in high school.

4330
05:22:36,510 --> 05:22:37,490
I peeked in high school.

05:22:45,590 --> 05:22:46,230
See, look.

4337
05:22:46,270 --> 05:22:47,210
I went from here.

4338
05:22:47,910 --> 05:22:48,770
And then...

4339
05:22:48,770 --> 05:22:50,630
And then we stopped.

4340
05:22:52,930 --> 05:22:55,230
We all fall off, you know?

4341
05:22:55,350 --> 05:22:56,450
We all...

4342
05:23:00,170 --> 05:23:01,210
It's okay, boy.

4343
05:23:01,310 --> 05:23:02,030
It's okay, bro.

4344
05:23:02,290 --> 05:23:03,330
Just like me.

4345
05:23:04,630 --> 05:23:06,110
Just like me.

4346
05:23:06,490 --> 05:23:07,750
The diamond one.

4347
05:23:08,210 --> 05:23:08,970
Yeah, it's okay.

4348
05:23:09,170 --> 05:23:10,630
It happens to everybody.

4349
05:23:10,890 --> 05:23:13,350
Guys, I swear, it happens to everyone.

4350
05:23:16,870 --> 05:23:18,070
That's why I'm back.

4351
05:23:18,150 --> 05:23:19,070
I'm back, baby.

4352
05:23:19,230 --> 05:23:19,770
I'm back.

4353
05:23:20,590 --> 05:23:21,890
I'm back, guys.

4354
05:23:24,530 --> 05:23:25,790
But wait, wait.

4355
05:23:25,950 --> 05:23:29,510
Before we need to watch, we have this was the thing we had to watch.

4356
05:23:29,650 --> 05:23:30,250
Where was it?

4357
05:23:30,650 --> 05:23:33,810
We had such a good streak and then this one was something.

4358
05:23:34,170 --> 05:23:36,370
Right here it was something else.

4359
05:23:36,530 --> 05:23:37,030
Where was it?

4360
05:23:37,070 --> 05:23:37,610
Where's Nom?

4361
05:23:38,730 --> 05:23:39,730
Was it here?

4362
05:23:40,430 --> 05:23:40,750
No.

4363
05:23:41,550 --> 05:23:42,690
It was here, right?

4364
05:23:43,150 --> 05:23:44,670
Was it with the coal train?

4365
05:23:45,490 --> 05:23:46,930
It was Central Park.

4366
05:23:47,030 --> 05:23:47,830
It was this, right?

4367
05:23:54,680 --> 05:23:55,240
Okay.

4368
05:23:56,260 --> 05:23:57,260
Here we go.

4369
05:23:58,900 --> 05:23:59,560
Is it here?

4370
05:24:05,320 --> 05:24:05,620
Okay.

4371
05:24:06,480 --> 05:24:09,280
Alright, let's watch the first instance of not.

05:24:20,270 --> 05:24:21,430
And I was like, get me out of here.

4375
05:24:21,750 --> 05:24:22,650
Get me out of here.

4376
05:24:30,680 --> 05:24:31,200
Okay.

4377
05:24:31,620 --> 05:24:32,140
All right.

4378
05:24:32,240 --> 05:24:35,140
And then the next one was like here, right?

4379
05:24:36,300 --> 05:24:37,740
Oh yeah, it was here.

4380
05:24:40,580 --> 05:24:42,840
Okay, it was here.

4381
05:24:43,420 --> 05:24:43,940
Pre-cap.

4382
05:24:46,600 --> 05:24:47,680
Brother here.

4383
05:24:47,880 --> 05:24:48,700
Pre-cap.

4384
05:24:49,880 --> 05:24:52,280
Alright, how did everything go wrong?

4385
05:24:55,400 --> 05:24:55,940
Okay.

4386
05:24:57,360 --> 05:24:58,780
Oh yeah, I had to kill here.

4387
05:24:59,340 --> 05:25:00,700
And then, there's me.

4388
05:25:04,400 --> 05:25:06,600
And then I was like, don't worry, guys.

4389
05:25:07,200 --> 05:25:07,440
And...

4390
05:25:08,020 --> 05:25:09,100
Where am I?

4391
05:25:10,040 --> 05:25:10,580
Wait.

4392
05:25:11,180 --> 05:25:11,980
Where am I?

4393
05:25:12,000 --> 05:25:12,380
Oh, there I am.

4394
05:25:12,400 --> 05:25:14,080
There I am!

4395
05:25:14,200 --> 05:25:15,280
There I am!

4396
05:25:15,460 --> 05:25:16,460
I was like, leave it!

4397
05:25:16,780 --> 05:25:17,760
Let me go!

4398
05:25:18,120 --> 05:25:19,300
And I'm back here!

4399
05:25:19,600 --> 05:25:24,490
I see, I'm right here.

4400
05:25:25,290 --> 05:25:25,970
Right here.

4401
05:25:27,210 --> 05:25:28,750
Okay, here I am.

4402
05:25:29,630 --> 05:25:30,590
This is...

4403
05:25:30,590 --> 05:25:31,770
I am...

4404
05:25:33,050 --> 05:25:33,730
Right, okay.

4405
05:25:35,970 --> 05:25:37,170
Let me...

4406
05:25:37,170 --> 05:25:38,710
move back a little bit.

4407
05:25:39,790 --> 05:25:40,510
There we go.

4408
05:25:42,090 --> 05:25:43,010
Where am I?

4409
05:25:43,790 --> 05:25:44,750
Where am I?

4410
05:25:44,770 --> 05:25:45,950
Where did I go?

4411
05:25:46,450 --> 05:25:47,490
Where did...

4412
05:25:47,490 --> 05:25:48,490
There I am!

4413
05:25:48,830 --> 05:25:49,550
I'm right here!

4414
05:25:50,050 --> 05:25:51,450
This is where I started screaming!

4415
05:25:51,950 --> 05:25:53,950
And then I was like, get me out of here!

4416
05:25:54,050 --> 05:25:55,310
And then I snapped back here!

4417
05:25:55,610 --> 05:25:56,890
And then they turned around!

4418
05:25:57,110 --> 05:25:58,530
And then I killed him!

4419
05:25:58,850 --> 05:25:59,670
I killed him!

4420
05:26:02,570 --> 05:26:03,490
There he is!

4421
05:26:06,530 --> 05:26:08,570
That was a wild ride.

4422
05:26:09,410 --> 05:26:10,790
That really was.

4423
05:26:11,470 --> 05:26:12,290
Look at me go.

4424
05:26:12,510 --> 05:26:13,630
That was the whole...

4425
05:26:13,770 --> 05:26:15,170
There he is.

4426
05:26:17,230 --> 05:26:18,150
That was true.

4427
05:26:18,250 --> 05:26:20,310
At least I brought someone down with me at the end.

4428
05:26:26,010 --> 05:26:26,950
Can we have...

4429
05:26:26,950 --> 05:26:27,170
No.

4430
05:26:27,290 --> 05:26:28,130
I'm too mad.

4431
05:26:29,090 --> 05:26:30,910
He doesn't deserve it.

4432
05:26:31,290 --> 05:26:33,550
He doesn't deserve a POV.

4433
05:26:33,930 --> 05:26:35,170
You know what he deserves?

4434
05:26:35,490 --> 05:26:36,390
What was his name?

4435
05:26:38,890 --> 05:26:40,430
Where is this liar?

4436
05:26:44,970 --> 05:26:45,650
Oh, shit.

4437
05:26:47,190 --> 05:26:47,750
Shit.

4438
05:26:52,290 --> 05:26:56,090
You get to block for me.

4439
05:26:56,230 --> 05:27:01,670
That amount of people reported for lying.

4440
05:27:02,170 --> 05:27:03,610
Yeah, yeah, it should be reported.

4441
05:27:04,070 --> 05:27:10,130
I mean, like, he lied in VC because he thinks I couldn't defend myself.

4442
05:27:12,570 --> 05:27:14,130
Completely fair.

4443
05:27:17,080 --> 05:27:18,690
That was fun.

4444
05:27:19,770 --> 05:27:20,790
Whoops, let me eat it.

4445
05:27:21,010 --> 05:27:22,330
It's that really quick.

4446
05:27:22,630 --> 05:27:23,170
That's fun.

4447
05:27:23,330 --> 05:27:24,010
I had a good time.

4448
05:27:25,050 --> 05:27:27,430
The five hours pass by is so fast for me.

4449
05:27:27,670 --> 05:27:28,550
I don't know what.

4450
05:27:28,950 --> 05:27:29,450
I don't know.

4451
05:27:30,370 --> 05:27:35,030
Rink just does something to me where time pass by is super duper fast.

4452
05:27:35,390 --> 05:27:39,890
Whenever I play Rink, it doesn't feel like a lot of time has passed when I play it.

4453
05:27:40,470 --> 05:27:45,010
And then I look at the time and I'm like, oh my god, that's a long time.

4454
05:27:47,290 --> 05:27:48,310
Where the heck is my...

4455
05:27:48,310 --> 05:27:49,010
Oh, there's the chat.

4456
05:27:49,490 --> 05:27:50,130
There it is.

4457
05:27:51,010 --> 05:27:52,310
I'm going to call it here.

4458
05:27:53,070 --> 05:27:58,490
I mean, you know, making up for all the streams that, you know, digging from taking a vacation.

4459
05:27:58,770 --> 05:27:59,970
I hope you guys had fun watching.

4460
05:28:00,850 --> 05:28:03,630
Tomorrow is Battlefield 6 tomorrow, early access.

4461
05:28:04,050 --> 05:28:07,410
So, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture checked.

4462
05:28:07,750 --> 05:28:09,630
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4463
05:28:09,850 --> 05:28:13,510
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

4464
05:28:13,850 --> 05:28:15,230
I'll see you guys next time, everyone.

4465
05:28:15,710 --> 05:28:16,290
Bye, guys.

4466
05:28:16,670 --> 05:28:17,150
Bye.
