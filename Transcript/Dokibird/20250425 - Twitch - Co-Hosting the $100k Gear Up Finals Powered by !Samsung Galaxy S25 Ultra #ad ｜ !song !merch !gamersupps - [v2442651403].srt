00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,420
Hello, everybody.

2
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,840
Hello, hello.

3
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,460
Did you guys like your loops?

4
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,540
Welcome, welcome.

5
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,840
For those who don't know.

6
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,920
Also, yes, it's me.

7
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,280
Hi.

8
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,760
Hi, Toki.

9
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,080
Hi.

10
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,380
Hi, dragons.

11
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,000
Hey.

12
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,280
Thank you, guys.

13
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,900
Oh, my God.

14
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,400
Thank you for the hype train, everybody.

15
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,140
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

16
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,380
Sorry, I'm like...

17
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:59,820
I guess every time when I swap from YouTube to Twitch, my mind also gets, like, a little bit jumbled up because I feel like, you know, I have to thank different things.

18
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,640
And, like, you know, because, like, Twitch and YouTube, they have different names for different things.

19
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,860
So, like, my mind is like, okay, is it a ship or a sub?

20
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,840
Hey, guys.

21
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,900
Hello, everybody.

22
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,380
Oh, wait.

23
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,680
I forgot.

24
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,360
I really didn't even finish my thanking for the subs.

25
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,380
But Marco, thank you for the five gifted subs.

26
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:16,780
Thank you.

27
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,320
Thank you.

28
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,680
Mehdi, thank you for the 400 biddies.

29
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,060
Thank you.

30
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,640
Thank you.

31
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,340
Zero, thank you for the gifted sub to Evil.

32
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,060
Thank you.

33
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,740
Thank you.

34
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,420
Qtay, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

Thank you, thank you.

36
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,340
Anonymous, thank you for giving tier 1 sub to Setsuna.

37
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,800
Thank you, thank you.

38
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,960
Hey guys, so for those who are wondering what am I doing on Twitch again, if you guys remember, I think it was like a week or two ago.

39
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,160
It was two weeks ago, I believe.

40
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:52,320
Um, we did a watch-along of the Samsung Galaxy Gear Up Cup presented by, uh, presented by and powered by Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

41
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,340
So we are here again, back here again, because what we watched last time was just the draft of the teams.

42
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:06,860
Now, it's the real tournament, the real finals cup, where they will be playing on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

43
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,040
Uh, so a bunch of teams are actually competing right now.

44
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,160
Um, but we are watching the finals of the, I believe, the final two teams that will make it to the end.

45
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,600
And it is in, I believe, it is hosted in Las Vegas!

46
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,260
Viva Las Vegas!

47
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,760
Uh, but yeah, it's, I believe, I just found out, like, the Level Up, the, where it's hosted.

48
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,060
Because it's in, like, Level Up, right?

49
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,720
It's actually a really big, um, expo regarding, like, for gaming and, uh, for gaming.

50
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:43,600
And I saw, like, a lot of people, uh, a lot of, like, my artist friends were actually, uh, uh, dealing art stuff.

51
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,620
Uh, so, yeah, it's gonna be really interesting.

52
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Like I said, it's all, it's Call of Duty Mobile.

53
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,280
So, they're all gonna be playing, and it's presented by Samsung.

54
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,000
So, um, uh, it's gonna be, like, all done on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

55
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,760
So, it's gonna be very interesting, because they got a bunch of teams in together.

56
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,780
Uh, got four Call of Duty Mobile Pros, um, and 16 Call of Duty players.

57
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,100
And then put them together, and then we're gonna see who's gonna win 100k.

58
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,040
Uh, so, yeah, today is the finals day!

59
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:16,800
Woo!

60
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,320
Is the coach still in?

61
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,580
I assume they're all playing, right?

62
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,420
I mean, it's, like, how many, it's, uh, 5v5, right?

63
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,600
I assume they're all playing.

64
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,900
Wait, are the, I think the coaches are playing, right?

65
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:44,960
Yeah, because there's, like, one of the match-ups is, like, coach-v-coach match-up, and, um, and I don't think the coach, I don't, well, we saw how they did in the 1v1s against the other pros, but I believe he could, he could coach them better than the other teams.

66
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:53,940
So, since he does actually, I think he was, like, the only, the coach was, like, the only one that actually, like, looked at, like, that looked at the players.

67
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,740
And, like, you know, I remember the other captains were, like, like, he looks cool in this photo.

68
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,480
I remember that.

69
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,980
But then the coach, yeah, they were, like, picking Shirley off of vibes.

70
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,660
But then the coach was, like, well, I saw this stream, like, uh, yesterday.

71
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,660
And, like, he seemed to know what he's doing.

72
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,020
And because he seemed, and he seems to be really good at this certain gun.

73
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,740
And then you cut to the other, other captain.

74
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,820
And he's like, ah, he looked really cool in that photo.

75
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,280
Like, he's like, look at that aura.

76
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,060
So, I don't know.

77
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,660
Honestly, I haven't really, I didn't check up on, like, which team is currently winning so far.

78
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,260
But we will look into that a little bit later.

79
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:43,300
But yes, a huge shout out to Samson for presenting the Gear Up Cup, the Galaxy Gear Up Cup.

80
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,180
And, um, you guys already know about the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

81
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,400
Um, if you guys forgot about, like, you know, some of the features it has.

82
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,540
It has, it's basically unmatched power.

83
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,460
So, um, it has the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.

84
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,900
So, the most advanced processor for any Galaxy phone.

85
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,900
And so, there's a crazy fast performance and super smooth gameplay, even with the most demanding games.

86
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:18,900
So, this is, like, this, I can see, like, this tournament being, like, a good, like, stress test on, like, showcasing you guys what you can do with gaming on mobiles.

87
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:27,300
And I think, like, mobile gaming is, like, especially in esports, mobile gaming and esports is, like, getting more and more popular around the world.

88
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,000
And, you know, it is definitely a really good market going into it.

89
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:40,240
Um, so, this is a great way to present, like, how, you know, how, how well it performs with, in, um, in this tournament.

90
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,980
And then there's, like, graphics that pop.

91
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,680
So, it got pro scalar temp that boosts image quality by 40% and upgraded ray tracing.

92
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,860
So, it makes lighting shadows and reflections look insanely real in games that support it.

93
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,400
And then there's also a huge display.

94
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,500
So, it's 6.9 inch display.

95
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:57,840
Nice.

96
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,740
With barely any, uh, bezels.

97
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,140
Um, so, and it has a 120 hertz refresh rate.

98
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,780
So, like, you know, better than when I started gaming.

99
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,980
Um, uh, when I started gaming, I did not get to play on 120 hertz.

100
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,100
And that was on a laptop.

101
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,440
Uh, and it also is cool under pressure.

102
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,820
So, it has a large, larger vapor chamber and upgraded cooling system.

103
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,700
So, basically, you can play as long as you can and won't, like, you know, like, scorch your, scorch your legs or your, or your hands and stuff like that.

104
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,280
Um, and comfortable gaming anytime.

105
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,560
The S25 Ultra is slimmer, lighter, and has a rounded design that feels amazing in your hands.

106
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,220
So, no cramps on your hands.

107
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,620
That's, like, the one thing I, I'm always scared about when I game too long.

108
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,780
Um, is, like, the fact that, I don't know.

109
00:13:49,840 --> 00:14:01,580
This is, like, every gamer's worst fear or, like, worst nightmare is when, if you game too much, you're gonna, you're gonna, like, you're, you would, like, you know, hurt your wrist or, like, spring your wrist and your arms.

110
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,300
You know what I was told?

111
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:17,200
Um, I was told that, um, I was told that, like, um, like, you know, it's, like, basically, like, the death sentence of, like, uh, of, like, pro players.

112
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,620
If you have, like, you know, if you, like, sprain your wrist or your, um, if your arm or anything regarding longer gaming sessions.

113
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:30,660
So, it's, it is nice to know that it does, there's no more, you don't really get hand cramps with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

114
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
So, you don't have to worry about that.

115
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,240
You can do longer game sessions and everything.

116
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:43,560
Um, so, yeah, it is very, that's why I don't do long game sessions anymore on PC because it's, like, considered, it's, like, a career-ending injury.

117
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:43,900
Yeah.

118
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,320
So, uh, because, like, on PC, it's a lot scarier because you do use your, you know, you, it depends on your sense, too.

119
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:51,680
It depends.

120
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,560
I use, I use arm, I move my mouse via arm movement.

121
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:07,260
I don't do wrist because wrist is, like, a lot scarier regarding and more easily, you're more easily to, like, get, like, carpal tunnel syndrome with using your wrist more than your arm.

122
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,820
And I try to do stretches and everything.

123
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:17,920
Um, but that's why I try to avoid long gaming sessions, uh, or, like, back-to-back-to-back long gaming sessions where I have to aim a lot.

124
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Uh, but yeah, so, I'm looking forward to seeing how much the team has improved for this tournament because I don't know if you guys remembered, but we didn't really see them play last time.

125
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,000
We only saw the coaches play.

126
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:45,500
So, I guess we're gonna see, like, um, how much they've improved in general and, um, and how much do they, have they, like, transitioned into mobile gaming and how well they're gonna do with that.

127
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,680
Uh, but yes, guys!

128
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,080
Woo!

129
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,540
Let me, let me, let me put the stream on real fast.

130
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,380
Also, let me know, let me know if the sound is okay because I didn't save the sound for last time.

131
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,120
All right.

132
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,020
Uh, let's get rid of... Oh, here it is.

133
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,700
Oh, you guys see it?

134
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,180
All right.

135
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,380
Let me know if the sound is okay.

136
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,760
I don't know if my sound guy is here.

137
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,420
Oh, yeah, but they're playing at the stadium right now, at the expo.

138
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,920
So, this is at, um, Level Up Expo in Las Vegas right now.

139
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,840
And they are competing for a hundred grand.

140
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,160
So, it, it's a lot of money.

141
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,860
It's a lot.

142
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,020
I mean, it's a hundred grand.

143
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,240
Like, imagine we could do...

144
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,200
With a hundred grand.

145
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,710
Wait, the captains are playing.

146
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,050
Wait, they are playing.

147
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,390
All right, I'll put the volume up a little bit.

148
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,650
Yeah, because it's 5v5.

149
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,570
I know Huskers.

150
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,610
I forgot how many people they, like, drafted in.

151
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,770
So, I wasn't, like, that sure if it was, like, if the coaches were playing.

152
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,030
Man, it kind of sucks when you're in a moment like this and you're like, Hey, talk about him.

153
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,910
Just say something bad.

154
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,810
Say something that is going to make you just do anything to stoke the flame a little bit.

155
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,370
And they're like, nah, he's dope.

156
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,150
We love him.

157
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,210
We're trying to farm content here.

158
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,590
What are they farming for?

159
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,870
Oh, wait, are they not there?

160
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,970
Oh, wait, they're not there yet.

161
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,570
They're just waiting for the last player.

162
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,790
Oh my god, flesh.

163
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,810
Oh, yeah, you guys want to know more about the tournament, um, and, uh, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

164
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,430
Uh, do exclamation point Samsung.

165
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,770
So convenient.

166
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,190
Huge shout out to my mods for setting all of this up for me.

167
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,990
It's been really cool to see everything going on around.

168
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,450
I'm glad that we're able to be a part of it.

169
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,270
Flesh.

170
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,290
We want to see the crowd.

171
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,050
I want to see the crowd.

172
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,770
85.

173
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,170
Ooh, 30,000.

174
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,270
Guys, what's 30,000 divided by five?

175
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,270
I'm actually serious.

176
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,510
What?

177
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,310
Guys, I'm not memeing.

178
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,090
What is 30,000?

179
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,670
Okay, 6K.

180
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,490
Thank you, guys.

181
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,230
You guys are my human calculator.

182
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,350
You guys are my human calculators.

183
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:24,890
Thank you.

184
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,150
I've boosted the volume a little up for...

185
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,770
All right, so that's 6K each.

186
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,550
Okay, yes.

187
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,010
And how many years have I been a streamer guy?

188
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,870
How many years have I been a streamer?

189
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:55,290
If you get the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, you will also have your very own calculator in your hands.

190
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,170
Oh, they beat Notorious.

191
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,790
Wait, who is Notorious?

192
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,830
Which one was Notorious?

193
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,890
Is this the coach's team?

194
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,090
Oh, that's awkward.

195
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,550
Does anyone remember who was in Notorious's team?

196
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,390
Was that the coach team?

197
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,670
Yeah.

198
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,490
Wait, is 30 divided by 6K?

199
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,310
Oh, it is.

200
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,670
Sorry, I had to count my hands.

201
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,710
Well, usually we're going to watch...

202
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,730
It was like the finals.

203
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,690
But I wanted to watch earlier.

204
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,770
You know, just so we don't know what's going on before.

205
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,910
All right, so they get...

206
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,690
Oh, so each person gets like 6K.

207
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,790
That's also a lot already.

208
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,110
That's a lot.

209
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,830
510.

210
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,330
Oh, wait, divide by 5.

211
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:54,890
Sorry.

212
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,610
My math no good.

213
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,510
Also, English too, apparently.

214
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,310
I just like...

215
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,210
I merged like three different languages into one sentence.

216
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,750
My English is not good.

217
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:44,390
Oh my god, wait, there is...

218
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,930
What the...

219
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,150
They already have 16 kills?

220
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,950
18?

221
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,790
Wait, is this point control?

222
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,430
Okay, no, this is point control.

223
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,510
I was going to say...

224
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,930
There is no way they got 24 kills.

225
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,070
It's like a kill per second.

226
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,630
I was like, that's crazy.

227
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,330
Oh my god, is this gamers versus momentum?

228
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:08,790
Awesome, okay.

229
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,490
Guys, is the volume okay now?

230
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,590
Oh, I love that gun skin.

231
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,050
Wait, it's like...

232
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,910
Oh, look!

233
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,750
It's like he's reloading a rose.

234
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,270
Yeah, the fact that this is all played on mobile is actually insane.

235
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,230
On the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

236
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,050
Oh my god.

237
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:31,890
Wait, that...

238
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,230
Wait, that...

239
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,930
Wait, who's that?

240
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,230
There's no way.

241
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,490
Is that the coach?

242
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,150
Guys, give him the soda, baby!

243
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,730
Okay, he is waiting.

244
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,750
Wait, it's...

245
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,210
Jez is a coach, right?

246
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,070
He's gonna at least give them a bit of time to set up on the hill and maybe find...

247
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,790
Oh my god, he's killing everybody.

248
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,670
Okay, Marsh, I feel like...

249
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,510
Continue to ensue as both players going back and forth and Marshy showing, Hey, look, man.

250
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,770
I'm just as capable.

251
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,410
More than capable at this point.

252
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,290
Oh my god, they die so fast.

253
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,970
He's got a missile as well.

254
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,470
And a two-piece limit.

255
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,230
Marshy again popping off when he needs to.

256
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,890
Yeah, I'm...

257
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:11,310
Guys, the coach has 16 kills and his team...

258
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,510
His teammates has four.

259
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,530
It's literally...

260
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,810
It's literally coach versus coach right now.

261
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,670
Oh my god.

262
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,030
Someone stop him.

263
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,610
Guys, someone...

264
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,930
Oh my god.

265
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,730
Jez Nixir Reed doesn't allow you to come on through.

266
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,430
Who is the better kick?

267
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,250
The next spawns are coming on through.

268
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,490
Nixa running...

269
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,690
Oh my god.

270
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,830
He's still got it.

271
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,310
Jez right now, really helping the team.

272
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,730
He's a star player.

273
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,610
This is a very different tower point versus what we saw in our first matchup of the day, where it felt like a very even distribution.

274
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:49,830
Oh my god.

275
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,510
Bro, he has 20 kills.

276
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,230
Let me watch the other player.

277
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,890
All right, the time to kill is scary.

278
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,550
It is.

279
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,610
This time though, Shifty and Nixa are actually gonna be at 21.

280
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,310
Alan, it's already at 23.

281
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,530
Get on with the time.

282
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:10,450
I'm sorry.

283
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,590
Oh, that's so smart.

284
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,290
Wait, Idan is so smart.

285
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,230
He's like...

286
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,690
I'm not aiming today.

287
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,250
That's so funny.

288
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,050
That's so smart.

289
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,190
I'm feeling super, super confident.

290
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,510
Just put yourself in an awkward spot where the team, you know...

291
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,030
It goes that fast.

292
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,550
Wait, Idan.

293
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,450
Go, Idan.

294
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,210
Contribute to the kills.

295
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,750
We'll get them back on into the game, but it's still the gamer's lead.

296
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,090
Wait, this is...

297
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,590
Wait a minute.

298
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,270
This is...

299
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,730
This is a deathmatch.

300
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,190
Wait.

301
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,470
I just realized.

302
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,870
It is.

303
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,950
So when they were at 26, this is...

304
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,890
The coach literally...

305
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,130
It has to be, right?

306
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,370
The target burn.

307
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,590
The triple kill will help bring...

308
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,130
It has...

309
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,710
Yeah, this is...

310
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,170
We were like, damn, you got 26 kills.

311
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,590
It's hard point.

312
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,830
Oh, it's capture the flat.

313
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,330
Oh, yeah.

314
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,250
It's hard point.

315
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,270
Oh, it's hard point.

316
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,530
Who has the point?

317
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,070
Where's the point?

318
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,590
Oh, it isn't?

319
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,650
It felt like...

320
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,450
It felt like deathmatch with the map.

321
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,330
Every time they...

322
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,590
But they died so fast that I thought they were doing deathmatch.

323
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,010
Oh, that's the point.

324
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,450
I see the point.

325
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:24,990
I see the point.

326
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,970
They're literally like...

327
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,210
Oh, he's gone.

328
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:27,950
Goodbye.

329
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,950
My corner now.

330
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,450
I like the guy that killed him.

331
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,290
It was like...

332
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:38,470
Yoink.

333
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,390
I'm mine now.

334
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,370
Oh, yeah, yeah.

335
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,990
Sound guy.

336
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,850
I know I asked you earlier if the sound was better.

337
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,390
And if I didn't bother reading your reply.

338
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,830
But I'll read your reply now.

339
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,450
If the sound is better now.

340
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,650
Who is this?

341
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,550
Oh, that's Shifty.

342
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,590
Oh!

343
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,070
Oh!

344
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,170
He's able to pop green with the death machine.

345
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,730
Unfortunately, he can't find Jez on the point.

346
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,830
Yeah, I don't think he's killing Jez, guys.

347
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,490
I...

348
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,390
Oh, it's fine for now.

349
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:14,710
Nice.

350
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,630
He's like, can't kill...

351
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,790
I don't think anybody's killing Jez.

352
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:25,590
I don't think that's happening.

353
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,990
And my goodness.

354
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,530
Every single time, it looks like there's a bit of momentum going in favor of gamers.

355
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,630
And it's immediately Jez in particular that takes everything out of their sails.

356
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:35,870
I...

357
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,670
Okay, I want to know...

358
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,850
I want to watch deathmatch with the coaches.

359
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:40,930
I...

360
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:52,050
I think it's because, like, Marshy, his best player is picking up.

361
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,550
So, you see, like...

362
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:59,170
Okay, it could be because, like, Jez is just killing everybody before his teammates could kill them.

363
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:04,090
But, like, Marshy's best player, Adrian, is, like...

364
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,550
It's, like, almost around Marshy's, like, kill count right now.

365
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,390
Why I feel so slow for me?

366
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,750
Because we're not watching Jez.

367
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,050
We saw Jez play, and he was killing people every second.

368
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,550
And now, like, it doesn't feel the same anymore.

369
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,330
I...

370
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,670
We saw what he was doing.

371
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,870
And...

372
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,230
So, because now it feels really fast.

373
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,090
Because Jez is literally, like, killing every...

374
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,830
I mean, like, he just killed five!

375
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,330
Like, one!

376
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,270
Like, he just...

377
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,590
Oh, and then he gets off.

378
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,210
Look at that.

379
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,010
He got another two kills.

380
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,150
Jez...

381
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,010
Does it still feel slow, guys?

382
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,310
Does it still feel slow?

383
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:48,910
Whoa!

384
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,550
It was not just a one-man combo.

385
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,570
Goodness.

386
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,010
Oh, wait, was that Marshy?

387
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:54,530
Okay.

388
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,510
Wait, Marshy's catching up!

389
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,650
Looks like Santana, last remaining, but shifty.

390
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,230
That's when he's around.

391
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,630
Huge for gamers.

392
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,050
I wish...

393
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,390
Faster!

394
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,710
One, two, three...

395
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,150
Ba-da-da-da-da-da...

396
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,970
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

397
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,310
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

398
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,110
Oh, what?

399
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,850
We're in Rockefeller Street.

400
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,230
Did you know that song isn't even...

401
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,490
That song isn't even written...

402
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,810
Was written for it...

403
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,970
I talked about it before...

404
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,930
But...

405
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,010
That song...

406
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,770
Was, like, not even written by an American.

407
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,110
It was done for Eurovision.

408
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,810
Oh my god, Marshy is caught up.

409
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,970
What is going... What?

410
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,970
What was that?

411
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,410
They have teleport behind you?

412
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,490
What?

413
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,390
What did I stop?

414
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,530
That happens, but I like the finesse.

415
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,690
I love the opportunity.

416
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,630
I love the chaos, and continuing to erupt here.

417
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,710
Nothing personal, kid.

418
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,510
Why did his teammates not help him?

419
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,510
Why did his teammates all just let that happen?

420
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,550
Nothing personal, kid.

421
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,470
They were expecting the 1v1.

422
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,930
I can't say that Momentum hasn't exactly done the same, but we're starting to see...

423
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,890
Um, is he right behind me, isn't he?

424
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,730
In order to create the gaps that we're seeing at the moment.

425
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,670
40 points ahead our gamers.

426
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,730
Momentum do have the point and are going to hold our...

427
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,070
Asclamation point, Samson.

428
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,690
They still have a very tall task ahead of them.

429
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,070
You shout out to Samson.

430
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,490
The second set of rotation for it feels like for the gamers to realize how they want to start playing this map here.

431
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,910
Seeing already, Adrian.

432
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,830
Equalizer in hand.

433
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,570
Oh my god, you can start fisting?

434
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,270
Unfortunately, there was nobody there on the point with you except the...

435
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,070
What was that?

436
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,270
What did he do?

437
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,630
What did he do?

438
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,410
He just, like, punched him.

439
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,570
What did he do?

440
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,270
You can do that?

441
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,770
This is a gunfight.

442
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,170
Oh, he's gone.

443
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,050
Another predator missile called on in.

444
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,350
He just, like, he just had his hands out and then they're dead.

445
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,150
Oh.

446
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,210
Oh.

447
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,090
Oh, is it a cosmetic?

448
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,530
Call of Duty has always been, like, incredibly fast-paced.

449
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,030
I feel like.

450
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,930
Like, the TTK for Call of Duty has always been, like, this fast, especially, like, if you can headshot.

451
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,870
It feels like Team F right now.

452
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,070
I think, like...

453
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,450
Oh, whoa.

454
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,010
I think the guns are interesting.

455
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,170
Jez coming through, takes a couple kills of his own.

456
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,350
And he's not done yet.

457
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,010
Oh, there's...

458
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,130
Oh, goodbye, Jez.

459
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,470
And he's gonna try to stall time now for his teammates to get around.

460
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,310
Next up...

461
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,150
It's so close.

462
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,890
So 190, 183.

463
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,670
In favor of momentum.

464
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,690
And again...

465
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,710
Yeah, it's really close.

466
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,110
That gap growing for gamers.

467
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,030
It is basically erased within six points our momentum.

468
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,870
Huskers caught up a little bit.

469
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,490
Huskers actually, like, has...

470
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,390
He just needs to...

471
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,530
I think, like, the strat is that for, like, the other team.

472
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,910
Like, for the non-captains.

473
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,010
Like, their actual players.

474
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,470
To, like, not bump into the...

475
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,430
Not bump into the other coaches.

476
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,770
And then fight the actual players.

477
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,150
Oh my god.

478
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,970
The movement they're doing on the phone.

479
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,370
It's so interesting to see.

480
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,330
Like, like, it doesn't...

481
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,210
That...

482
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,390
It looks, like, really smooth.

483
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,190
This is huge for momentum to get to this point first.

484
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,190
Gamers within 50 now at this point.

485
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,110
Pass that to 200.

486
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,650
Yeah, they needn't...

487
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,630
They needn't cap the point.

488
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,710
They don't have point yet.

489
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,270
He knows he can't give this to gamers.

490
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,950
And let them continue on with their lead.

491
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,890
Pros are not...

492
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,470
They were built in the lab.

493
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,050
Um...

494
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,070
Excuse me.

495
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,450
Um...

496
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,270
Regular people cannot see above 60 frames per second.

497
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,470
Why do you need higher frames?

498
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,130
They can't see more than 60 frames unless you are built in the test tube.

499
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,850
What is going on?

500
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,910
Wait.

501
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,810
That guy tried to kill Jez standing.

502
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,490
I wanna...

503
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:21,610
Wait.

504
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,870
Who was the guy?

505
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:27,530
That was trying to kill Jez standing still.

506
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,850
Who was that?

507
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,090
Can you see that?

508
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,150
Oh my god.

509
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,390
Just stood still and he just was like, okay.

510
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:38,810
Just...

511
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,890
Just like...

512
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,690
Like...

513
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:40,990
Turns.

514
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,390
And then...

515
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,990
Who was that?

516
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,350
Pushing on forward.

517
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,350
They are here.

518
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,530
One last final...

519
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,750
I was like so confused.

520
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,210
I was like, did he just whip that...

521
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,170
Whip an entire mag?

522
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,670
What?

523
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,130
Is that an ice gun?

524
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,310
I don't know if you necessarily need it though.

525
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,230
When Marshy is popping two...

526
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:05,470
Oh wait.

527
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,490
There they are.

528
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,130
Smiles for the gamers.

529
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,530
You see the comms are flying.

530
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,630
Adrian rubbing his hands together.

531
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,230
Saying, hey.

532
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,870
I know Marshy is here.

533
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,770
But put some respect on my name, baby.

534
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,910
And I make sure...

535
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,570
You can...

536
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,230
Then you know they're all actually playing on...

537
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,330
On the mobile phones.

538
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,550
On the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

539
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,790
Exclamation point Samsung.

540
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:25,830
Really again.

541
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,550
Full team effort required.

542
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,390
And it continues to go over the themes of the day.

543
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,330
As we've spoken about...

544
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,290
I just can't do more.

545
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,210
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

546
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,850
Common for both of the captains throughout this matchup.

547
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,430
But that's not gonna be enough.

548
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,310
You need to make sure...

549
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,390
I wonder if they have the...

550
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,670
Uh...

551
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,830
There it is.

552
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,610
Oh my gosh.

553
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,930
It's like really slim too.

554
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,370
I like that the phone is like slim.

555
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,190
I don't like bulky phones in general.

556
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,330
All hands baby.

557
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,270
All fingers.

558
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,670
Come on out.

559
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,010
Come on out.

560
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,890
I think that was like one of the big things you saw right there too.

561
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,830
Both Adrian and Marshy.

562
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,610
We're calling in predator missiles, right?

563
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,510
Other than the other series we watched...

564
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:15,990
It was just...

565
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,930
Does it take like a long time to build these missiles?

566
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,290
So the fact that we...

567
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,490
Cause like...

568
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,910
Jez built it like what?

569
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:23,810
Two or three times?

570
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,530
What sense?

571
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,890
Exclamation point sense.

572
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:27,710
What sense?

573
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,290
What sense are they on?

574
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,770
Is it a kill streak?

575
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,530
Wait.

576
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,450
Wait.

577
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,330
Kills...

578
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:42,630
Really?

579
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,190
Okay.

580
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,950
So...

581
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,970
James and Marshy both had a lot...

582
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,250
What is this ice...

583
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,290
The purifier?

584
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,150
What the heck is a purifier?

585
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:50,270
It's okay.

586
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,310
It didn't come back to punish him though.

587
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,970
They still take the round overall.

588
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,570
And not only to take the round...

589
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,350
They now find themselves with a 1-0 lead...

590
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,410
Going into our 1v1.

591
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,570
And as we've talked about...

592
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,790
This might be the most important...

593
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,610
It's an air appear.

594
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,210
Oh, it's like a flamethrower.

595
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:05,830
So...

596
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,730
But like for ice.

597
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,290
Oh!

598
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,310
I like how...

599
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,590
What's his name?

600
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,270
The ribby guy was like...

601
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,390
That's it.

602
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,810
I'm not aiming anymore.

603
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,210
Brrrr.

604
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,370
Ha ha ha ha.

605
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,570
Ha ha ha.

606
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,810
He's just like...

607
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:21,690
Ha ha ha.

608
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,970
No more aiming.

609
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,730
Ha ha ha ha.

610
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:24,870
Ha ha ha.

611
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,170
As we get ready to go on through.

612
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:26,790
I gotta imagine...

613
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,670
It's only going down to like...

614
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,930
A one or two kill game.

615
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:29,350
It's gone.

616
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,830
Much different than earlier...

617
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,390
Where it seemed like it was like...

618
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:31,970
Five or six.

619
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,750
Alright, so...

620
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,930
They're doing next game mode.

621
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:34,990
I remember...

622
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,650
Wait, actually...

623
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,470
I think I have the format...

624
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,870
On what the next game mode is.

625
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,610
I remember they talked about it during the draft.

626
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,970
Should I draft?

627
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,570
I don't know why I put the TH there.

628
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,890
But I do remember that they did...

629
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,010
They did talk about what the...

630
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:54,830
What it is.

631
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,250
Let me see.

632
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,590
I don't remember, guys.

633
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,270
What was the next...

634
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,890
Guys, do you guys remember the next game mode?

635
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,030
Bang, bang, bang.

636
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,090
Over and over again.

637
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,470
And I wonder if that ability to have those quick reactions...

638
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,590
And those individual guns...

639
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,670
It's an ice cosmetic for the pure...

640
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,290
Nope, guys.

641
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,810
You were supposed to be my brains.

642
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,730
You ain't got this, brother.

643
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,270
You guys streamers don't think?

644
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,550
I do remember that it would be played on the Samsung Galaxy S25.

645
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,850
You know what?

646
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,810
You know what?

647
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,550
That's a good thing to remember, though.

648
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,330
I'm glad...

649
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,870
I'm glad you met you.

650
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,010
That's actually a good thing to remember.

651
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,710
Is it for $15,000 though?

652
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,110
I want you to know which game mode goes next.

653
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,930
Wrong streamer.

654
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,550
Wait, it's 1v1?

655
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,890
Oh, is it coach versus coach?

656
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,170
Oh, it's 1v1.

657
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,330
On Kill House.

658
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,670
Because this is a strong opportunity right now, like you said.

659
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,270
Where you lose that hard point.

660
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,010
Definitely a lot closer than I think we would have imagined.

661
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,850
It was just off of some, you know, final sort of good smart plays.

662
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,410
And kills that transition to hill time.

663
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,070
From the gamers that give them that map.

664
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,570
But when it comes on down to the series as a whole.

665
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,230
I feel like Jess definitely really has an opportunity to come right on back.

666
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,270
Tie up this series and say, yo, we're at least going to another hard point.

667
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:10,470
Right?

668
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,270
We're at least being able to...

669
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,370
1v1.

670
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,330
Final destination.

671
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,570
Coaches only.

672
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:16,910
Haha.

673
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:18,970
Haha.

674
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,570
If Marshy is able to win this.

675
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,530
Put them up 2-0.

676
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,370
And then we got to go into that express search and destroy.

677
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,250
In map number 3.

678
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:27,690
But I mean...

679
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,470
Search and destroy?

680
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,310
Which one is search?

681
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,950
Wait, is search and destroy like...

682
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,430
Um...

683
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,470
It's like tactical shooter, right?

684
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,730
Is that search and destroy?

685
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,350
Yeah.

686
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,610
I was gonna say...

687
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,230
Oh, they can't...

688
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,870
You're not allowed to look at each other.

689
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,530
Haha.

690
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,870
You see like the little...

691
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,610
The boxed up area?

692
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,110
You're not allowed to look at each other.

693
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,270
Haha.

694
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,490
But it's not going to be easy.

695
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,270
Doing anything you can to avoid that scenario...

696
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,110
Oh my...

697
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,590
Haha.

698
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,170
Oh my god.

699
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:00,850
Wait, this is...

700
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,170
Ohhhh.

701
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,830
He had the initial shots, but...

702
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,510
Airborne is Marshy to get...

703
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,350
Wait, I wanna...

704
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:05,970
Oh, yeah.

705
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,310
This is coach versus coach.

706
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,690
Ohhhh.

707
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,130
Ohhhh.

708
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,750
That was a nice shot.

709
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:16,730
Ohhhh.

710
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,930
It's like whoever hits that headshot.

711
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:22,990
Jesus!

712
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,830
Oh what?

713
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,110
That was one hit!

714
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,700
What did he do?!

715
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,260
Does he have a sniper?

716
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,480
Oh, it's a sniper.

717
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,640
Oh, now he has a shotgun.

718
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,040
Oh, wait, this is... Is this gun game?

719
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,320
Oh, it's loadout.

720
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,220
That's his loadout.

721
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,920
He has a sniper shotgun.

722
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Oh, that's crazy.

723
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,340
No, he's literally running sniper shotgun.

724
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,140
That is so... That... That is... Oh, my God.

725
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,060
That's the overcomp.

726
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,380
Okay, this is actually... Jesus!

727
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,320
Why is she?

728
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,360
Oh, he can't get ladders!

729
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,000
That is an insane shot.

730
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,580
Like, one shot sniper?

731
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,280
Like, the confidence in that.

732
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,140
That's scary.

733
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,780
If he's, like, a really good sniper, like, it's so hard to, like...

734
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,320
Jesus!

735
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,780
That was a body shot.

736
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,560
Unlucky.

737
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,140
Wait, I want to see him use it...

738
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,400
What's the loaded glitch?

739
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,200
The KRM-262.

740
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,900
Is that, like... Is that a shotgun or a sniper?

741
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,620
Is that a sniper?

742
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,660
With only one kill.

743
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,980
The... The one that Marshy's holding on?

744
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,940
Try and take a look.

745
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,060
It is all mobile.

746
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,560
What's so crazy about these shotguns?

747
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,480
You show yourself for just even a split second and you are getting cut on.

748
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:00,700
Jeez.

749
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,300
Oh, this is a shotgun v.

750
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,200
Shotgun now.

751
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,540
Six to six right now.

752
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,640
We knew this was gonna be close.

753
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:05,960
Okay.

754
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,540
Oh, my God.

755
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,180
They're just running... What?

756
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,700
Wait, so headshot shotgun is insta-kill.

757
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,360
Oh, my... Okay.

758
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,580
That's... That's scary.

759
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,540
That's actually... That's actually scary.

760
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,220
No, they're all just playing on their... The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

761
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,420
What is that shot?

762
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,620
I'm not gonna even do this in FNK.

763
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,400
That's... Like, the strafing is actually so good.

764
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,940
I actually... It's always, like, so impressive to watch, like, really good players strafe.

765
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,380
With him.

766
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,300
It's not gonna be enough for Marshy to win that one.

767
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,720
And Jez will take another...

768
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,160
I like normal blood, but high cali- Calibre.

769
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,280
That's not a shotgun.

770
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,380
That's a cannon.

771
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,260
Maybe two kills.

772
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,500
And at that, it's...

773
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,740
I like how he...

774
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,180
Like, wait, it's...

775
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,340
Oh, my God.

776
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,720
The ladder juke.

777
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,860
We keep going, though.

778
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,200
Again.

779
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,260
Oh, wow.

780
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,820
You're almost at the halfway mark.

781
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,620
Okay, that was really good.

782
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,540
That was a good shot.

783
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:13,860
Yeah.

784
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,480
What the...

785
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,960
It's like the mind game.

786
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,440
What?

787
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,920
What was that shot?

788
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,200
I want rewind.

789
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,820
I want, like...

790
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,560
I want the rewind of that.

791
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,500
Bro, this should be a montage.

792
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,980
They should put...

793
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,660
They put this in a montage.

794
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,420
These are some insane shots.

795
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,880
Like, look at that movement.

796
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,100
Demon, he didn't lose momentum.

797
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,660
Like, he...

798
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,240
Do you see how he's, like, the...

799
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,660
The 360 rotate?

800
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,840
He literally didn't lose momentum from that.

801
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,720
Like...

802
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,060
It's so...

803
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,880
Where?

804
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,480
I can't burn.

805
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,440
Oh.

806
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
Oh, my God.

807
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,160
I want to see, like, replay.

808
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,300
Like, some of these shots are insane.

809
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,440
I feel like we've got a half a second just to stay here.

810
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,680
Like, you can only peek for, like, one second.

811
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,720
Doesn't matter the distance.

812
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Shotguns will fire.

813
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,920
Marshy will try to escape.

814
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:19,580
Running all the way back, knowing that if he gets stabbed even once more, that's another kill for Jez, and we get closer to a tie game.

815
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,600
That's crazy.

816
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,280
This movement is, like, so fun to watch.

817
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,440
That's a God 1v1 right there.

818
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,300
Yeah, the one frame peek.

819
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,460
Yeah, he has to, like, figure out where he is.

820
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,940
Oh, and then there's, like, regen, so he's waiting for it.

821
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,300
Oh!

822
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:37,820
Okay.

823
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,840
That was the overconfidence of that.

824
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:46,800
Keep believing that Marshy is going to find himself a bit of a lead, and it will not be fouled.

825
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,420
The furthest he can get away from Jez at this point is maybe two kills, and maybe doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence as we...

826
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,080
Oh, my God.

827
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,440
...go back to a tie game.

828
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,500
It's tied.

829
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,720
This is so close.

830
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,740
This is actually incredibly close.

831
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,040
These 1v1s are so fun to watch.

832
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,780
Yeah.

833
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,760
High-level gaming has always been, like, incredible.

834
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,860
It's just very impressive that this is all done on...

835
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:24,920
These are, like, mobile pro players, so they're obviously very used to the mechanics of playing on mobile, but it is incredibly impressive, and it's, like, really interesting to see, like, what you can do in mobile gaming.

836
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,060
There's a semblance of a lead here.

837
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,380
If you can find another third one...

838
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,180
And, like, it's all done on, like, the Samsung Galaxy.

839
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,340
That's 25 Ultra.

840
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,220
Again, we just can't seem to escape that two-kill margin.

841
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,740
And they're streaming this, too.

842
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,180
The fact that it's, like...

843
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,640
They're streaming this gameplay...

844
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,860
Um...

845
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,600
Oh, my God.

846
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,820
...he's gonna increase it further.

847
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,520
17 for Jez.

848
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,420
Three away.

849
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,460
Jez is winning this?

850
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:48,800
I don't...

851
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,400
Oh, wait, Jez.

852
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:49,940
Oh, my God.

853
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,580
Wait, he is.

854
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,500
Oh, what?

855
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,720
He wall-banged her.

856
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,980
Wait.

857
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,100
Wait, Jez wall-b...

858
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,640
What?

859
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,620
Okay, that was impressive.

860
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,960
Almost closed this one on out.

861
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,260
Only two more needed.

862
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,100
That's insane.

863
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,100
The wall-bang?

864
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,500
Two fantastic players.

865
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,220
Jez, a lot of pressure on your shoulders.

866
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,920
Jez, no, Jez.

867
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,820
Oh, the movement.

868
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,800
Jez, turn around.

869
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,700
Turn around.

870
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,060
No, he didn't.

871
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:20,590
Turn around.

872
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,610
Turn around.

873
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,290
Oh, no.

874
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,870
Jez needs him.

875
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,550
Jez is...

876
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,730
Oh!

877
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,350
Last kill.

878
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,250
I think Jez is mechanically is the better player.

879
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:34,630
Oh!

880
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,410
That was a good match to watch.

881
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,470
That was...

882
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,690
Oh, he has to...

883
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,270
Oh, he has...

884
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,350
You know, he's a professional.

885
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,010
You see that?

886
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,670
He has to...

887
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:52,110
You know, okay, so, like, for those who don't know, and, um...

888
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,330
For those who don't know, in, um...

889
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,450
Uh, PC, people have...

890
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,750
Wear, like, the arm sleeve.

891
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,370
But on mobile gaming, they wear, like, these, like, the finger sleeves.

892
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:02,070
Yeah.

893
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:03,150
The...

894
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,450
The...

895
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,870
I don't know what they're called.

896
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,370
I don't know what they're called.

897
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,490
The thumb...

898
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,370
The thumb sleeves.

899
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,870
Jez and Marshy...

900
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,190
Because it makes the movement...

901
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,610
Because, like, um...

902
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:15,470
For those who don't know, it's because, like...

903
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,650
Okay, so, like, for the people...

904
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,610
The reason why people wear arm sleeve is because, um...

905
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:24,590
The texture of your skin and also, like, the hair, like, for...

906
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:30,150
Especially for guys, the hair on your arms produces friction and also, like, there's sweat and stuff.

907
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,830
So...

908
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,690
Because, you know, you're sweating and stuff.

909
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,210
So...

910
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:37,130
It makes your movement a lot less smooth and a lot less, like...

911
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:39,530
It's more slow and rough when you're moving your arm.

912
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,370
So that's why you see pro players wear, like, arm sleeves.

913
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,670
For mobile gamers, they wear thumb sleeves.

914
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:46,550
So...

915
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,650
I don't know what the proper term is, but I've...

916
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,470
I've heard of them.

917
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:58,550
It does the same thing because, like, it reduces the texture on your thumbs and also, like, it doesn't have, like, you know, it absorbs the sweat.

918
00:44:59,190 --> 00:44:59,570
So...

919
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,370
So you can have, like, a smoother...

920
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:05,030
A smoother, like, aim and stuff.

921
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:05,990
So...

922
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:06,410
Yeah!

923
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,210
I'm a nerd!

924
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,870
I hope one day I get an arm sneeze sponsor.

925
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,090
And finger sneeze.

926
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:17,190
I will make sure that I'll have finger sneeze for the mobile gamers, too.

927
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,290
I'm inclusive for all.

928
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,470
I've already seen mobile gaming in the next few years.

929
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:51,290
I think mobile gaming is just going to get more and more popular because, like, it's already incredibly popular in Asia in general.

930
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:57,010
Like, there's a lot of, like, there's, like, you know, a lot of, like, MOBAs, FPS.

931
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,270
I know, like, there's a lot of MOBAs and FPS games in...

932
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:07,110
for eSports and mobile for...

933
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,350
in Asia and Southeast Asia in general.

934
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,750
So it's already incredibly popular.

935
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:15,610
For those who don't know, in the...

936
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:26,950
in the eSport World Cup, if you guys didn't know, if you guys see in the eSport World Cup, the stuff that's in there, there's actually a lot of...

937
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,110
a lot of...

938
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,390
Sorry, I need to turn it down because I get this...

939
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,330
my brain doesn't work so well when I'm...

940
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,310
when I'm listening to them talking as a whole while.

941
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,330
You know, like, when someone else is talking?

942
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:51,630
Um, when someone else is talking and then you, you, like, absorb what they're saying into your head and then, like, it, like, messes with your sentences and stuff?

943
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:57,930
Uh, uh, uh, like, that's what's going on in my head right now.

944
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:03,050
Anyway, as I was saying, uh, let me turn them down.

945
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,510
Dude, my stuff is more important right now.

946
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,910
Wait, actually...

947
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,250
Okay, I already analyzed their gameplay.

948
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,050
Alright, anyway.

949
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:20,870
Anyway, so, for those who don't know, um, for those...

950
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,070
Okay, they're analyzing their gameplay right now, guys.

951
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,650
They're analyzing the gameplay.

952
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:26,470
But I want to give an interesting fact.

953
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,130
For those who don't know, um, in the Overwatch...

954
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:30,910
Not Overwatch, sorry.

955
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,970
In the, uh, World...

956
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:33,510
Cup...

957
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:34,810
World Cup eSports.

958
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,710
Um, that's going to be, like, happening in a couple of months.

959
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:44,270
They actually included, I think, like, two to three mobile games in the eSports World Cup.

960
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,830
Um, because they're in...

961
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:48,150
And I was, like, looking at it, and I was like, what games are these?

962
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,590
I don't...

963
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,330
like, I've never heard about these games before.

964
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:55,150
I looked them up, um, because there's, like, a lot of big game titles in the eSports World Cup.

965
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,250
And you know, there's a lot of money being invested in it, too.

966
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:07,650
And, um, and I looked them up and they're all, like, really popular titles within, like, Asia and Southeast Asia that's just for, like, mobile gaming.

967
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:18,590
And you have, like, you have to know, like, to even be, like, considered in the eSports World Cup, they have to have a lot of money invested in it.

968
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:25,150
Because, like, first place in the eSports World Cup is, like, like, millions of dollars in general.

969
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:32,650
Like, I think it's, like, I remember, like, some of the game prizes, like, game prizes for it, for the, because it's literally the eSports World Cup.

970
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:40,230
Like, it's, the entire world is participating, um, in that, in there for various game titles.

971
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:51,790
Uh, so, some of the, some of the games, some of the, um, some of the games that's involved, the prizes are, like, millions of dollars in general.

972
00:48:52,030 --> 00:49:05,830
And to even be involved in it, and to be, like, a team in the eSports World Cup, they have, it's, like, you have to, you know, be able to invest in it and be able, like, basically pay to be in the tournament and stuff like that.

973
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:19,990
So, the fact that they had, like, two to three mobile games in there, just to be part of the The eSport World Cup is already like... you know how much money was already invested into it... in general.

974
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:26,830
So that's like a little insider... I know like actual insider knowledge of how much money was spent.

975
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:35,530
But also I don't know, even teams have to pay to be involved in the eSport World Cup.

976
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:40,110
So like... and I know how much teams have to pay to be like in it.

977
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:46,030
Because it's like, you know, you're buying in a spot.

978
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:51,710
It's not like... it's not a... it's not like, you know, a league of it.

979
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,750
They have to buy a spot to be able to participate.

980
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:59,090
So that's why you can see a lot of teams signing up like...

981
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,830
So like, for example, you can see like teams and various other game titles...

982
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,250
signing up, like rapidly signing teams up right now...

983
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,470
to be part of the eSport World Cup.

984
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,310
Yeah, you're not ready for that player to be kind of waiting on in there...

985
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:16,550
So like, you know how like there's some titles where like, you know, they never had a team before...

986
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,250
But when they announced that a particular game...

987
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,750
is in...

988
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:21,390
um...

989
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:24,520
a particular game is like in the eSport World Cup...

990
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,730
They quickly like...

991
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,710
Even the last like two to three weeks, there were so many teams...

992
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:29,440
that got announced...

993
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:30,890
signed...

994
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,150
to like an org...

995
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:34,990
because they want to bring a team to participate in the World Cup...

996
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,370
since they already bought a spot...

997
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,730
to participate in it.

998
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,690
that momentum...

999
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:39,730
Yeah, did keep their momentum...

1000
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:40,810
from the 1v1...

1001
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:41,550
Yeah...

1002
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,030
Jez...

1003
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,750
What on earth, brother?

1004
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:44,370
Just taking a...

1005
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,030
But yeah, it's quite interesting...

1006
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,050
Like it's an interest...

1007
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,710
I like like learning about stuff like that...

1008
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:50,110
I guess it's just...

1009
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,070
Oh, this is the...

1010
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,170
Search and Destroy, right?

1011
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,090
That's what happens...

1012
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:53,170
You're...

1013
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,890
You're getting put on...

1014
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,790
It's one-to-one now...

1015
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:57,790
Like the...

1016
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,290
I love the gun skins...

1017
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,230
They're so interesting...

1018
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,190
I'm seeing some early picks go on through...

1019
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:15,830
But we...

1020
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:16,930
Get down into this round...

1021
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,790
Into a 2v2 right now...

1022
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:20,350
And gamers...

1023
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,790
They're kind of starting to work this together...

1024
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:23,490
Santana...

1025
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,050
He's kind of making a big rap on the outside...

1026
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:25,650
Trying to clear it...

1027
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,790
But you're leaving your teammate all alone...

1028
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,410
I'm so bad at these types of game modes...

1029
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,930
I'm not patient enough...

1030
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,650
Especially when the time to kill is so fast...

1031
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:36,810
But you just have to...

1032
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:38,990
Wait, who's planting?

1033
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,270
Okay...

1034
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:41,970
Blue is defender...

1035
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:42,950
Wait...

1036
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:43,510
Oh...

1037
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,510
They don't wanna...

1038
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:44,950
They can't...

1039
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,790
They have to rush him...

1040
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:47,010
No!

1041
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:47,970
Why did you help him?

1042
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:48,170
No!

1043
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,490
Oh my god!

1044
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,550
Marshy baited his team!

1045
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:53,670
Marshy was like...

1046
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:56,050
Marshy's like...

1047
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,690
You're not the better player...

1048
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,950
You go do it for me...

1049
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,090
You go do it for me...

1050
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:03,050
Marshy actually...

1051
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,570
Whatever it takes...

1052
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:08,970
He's like...

1053
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,130
You know you're not better than me...

1054
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,530
Whatever it takes...

1055
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,930
I'll try and win this 1v1...

1056
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:16,910
Cause even if Marshy loses that...

1057
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:17,750
Opportunity...

1058
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,650
For obviously...

1059
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,270
Being able to...

1060
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,610
To maybe just have it go just long enough...

1061
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,390
That there's not gonna be an opportunity for that bomb...

1062
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,010
It must be done...

1063
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,810
Also that's why I don't like...

1064
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:29,630
I don't like...

1065
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:30,350
Like...

1066
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:30,910
These...

1067
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,310
Tactical shooter type gameplay...

1068
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,050
Because...

1069
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,010
For me...

1070
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:36,170
It's more like...

1071
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:36,910
Haha...

1072
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,410
You get baited so hard...

1073
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,370
Haha...

1074
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:39,850
But...

1075
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:40,650
He...

1076
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,250
Either I bait the team...

1077
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:42,710
My teammates...

1078
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,050
Or they bait me...

1079
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,150
And that pisses me off...

1080
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:46,790
Haha...

1081
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:48,670
Haha...

1082
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:50,830
Haha...

1083
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:51,230
Wait...

1084
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:51,890
Wait...

1085
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:52,910
Where was he aiming at?

1086
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:54,510
Haha...

1087
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:54,590
Haha...

1088
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,510
He's like...

1089
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,230
Who is he?

1090
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,430
Which has now left them in a 2v1...

1091
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:59,390
Technically to their advantage...

1092
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,690
I'm gonna blow my nose guys...

1093
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:01,310
And I'm not muting...

1094
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:02,390
Cause I'm lazy...

1095
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:03,810
Yeah...

1096
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,830
I don't have enough mind for these games!

1097
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:10,670
You see Jez...

1098
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:10,850
Just...

1099
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:11,990
Push on down there...

1100
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:12,990
Looking at the bottom ramp...

1101
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,290
We'll catch that player...

1102
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:15,490
Pushing on out...

1103
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:17,490
So...

1104
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:18,470
But yeah...

1105
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:18,590
I...

1106
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,070
Oh yeah...

1107
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:19,590
But yeah...

1108
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:19,930
Like...

1109
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,590
Um...

1110
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,090
An example would be like...

1111
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:26,370
You know how like...

1112
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:26,870
Um...

1113
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,810
Apex signed a lot of teams...

1114
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:29,670
Recently...

1115
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:30,010
Like...

1116
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,170
Apex Orgs...

1117
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,590
Signed a bunch of teams...

1118
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,430
Because a lot of them...

1119
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:35,410
Have spots in the World Cup...

1120
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,510
And...

1121
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:37,850
Another way to get into...

1122
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:38,010
Like...

1123
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:38,790
Not just like...

1124
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,370
For like...

1125
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,270
All game titles...

1126
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,330
Either a team...

1127
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:42,930
Buys in a spot...

1128
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,830
For the World Cup...

1129
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:45,790
Or...

1130
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:46,330
Um...

1131
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,790
This is for all the game titles...

1132
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:48,290
Or...

1133
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,490
They have enough...

1134
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,350
Points...

1135
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,610
In the league...

1136
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,530
So like...

1137
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,070
If you're...

1138
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,370
If you don't have...

1139
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,450
If you're not...

1140
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:55,910
Um...

1141
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:57,390
If you're not one of the teams...

1142
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,110
That have a guaranteed spot...

1143
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,390
In the World Cup...

1144
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:01,570
Um...

1145
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,730
It's all dependent...

1146
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:03,590
On like...

1147
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:04,930
How many points you get...

1148
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,310
From the league...

1149
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:06,630
Of...

1150
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:07,690
From like...

1151
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:27,370
Um...

1152
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:27,730
The reason why...

1153
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:28,650
You don't see like...

1154
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:29,890
Marvel Rivals...

1155
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:30,790
In the World Cup...

1156
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:31,910
Is...

1157
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:32,490
Because...

1158
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:32,850
Uh...

1159
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,830
They don't have a league yet...

1160
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:35,290
Um...

1161
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,170
The MRC doesn't count as a league...

1162
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,430
In Marvel Rivals...

1163
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:40,010
He's not only gotten a kill through the box...

1164
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,590
He gets two players...

1165
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,210
In one round...

1166
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,630
It's just they haven't started a league...

1167
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,830
Cause...

1168
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:45,870
MRC is like...

1169
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,110
Anyone can enter...

1170
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,630
It's not like...

1171
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:49,150
A...

1172
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,970
Um...

1173
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,350
It's not like...

1174
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:51,750
Um...

1175
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,670
Actual like...

1176
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:53,110
League...

1177
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:53,650
Where like...

1178
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:54,790
All the top teams...

1179
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:55,430
Are like...

1180
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,750
Automatically in...

1181
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:57,570
Organization though...

1182
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:57,710
Again...

1183
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:58,250
Momentum...

1184
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:58,890
Quick to the point...

1185
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,030
Quick to the kills...

1186
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,330
Already three dead...

1187
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:01,930
Four gamers...

1188
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,370
Just because they have no opportunity...

1189
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:03,430
To...

1190
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,690
Yeah...

1191
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,970
It has to be more exclusive...

1192
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:05,210
Fights...

1193
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:05,970
And really kind of...

1194
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:06,910
Push it into their favor...

1195
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:07,210
It's just...

1196
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,390
You're losing all your gunfights...

1197
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,470
Immediately into a round...

1198
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:09,550
And...

1199
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,390
You're constantly putting your teammates...

1200
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,350
In these 2v3...

1201
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,210
2v4 situations...

1202
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,510
It's Marshy and Shifty...

1203
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,530
Last two members alive...

1204
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,930
Cause there's no LAN event...

1205
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:19,230
That's the thing...

1206
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,430
If there's no LAN event...

1207
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,270
It doesn't count...

1208
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,470
Cause the MRC is all online...

1209
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:24,650
And also the MRI...

1210
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,310
Task here...

1211
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:25,950
But there's like...

1212
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:26,910
All the other game titles...

1213
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:27,990
That you see in the World Cup...

1214
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,870
They're all like LAN events...

1215
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,070
You can spread a lot of space...

1216
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:31,850
Right now here...

1217
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,070
Cut some of these players off...

1218
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:33,610
And I like this...

1219
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:34,710
Play 2x2...

1220
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:35,710
Get some of this info...

1221
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:36,310
If you need it...

1222
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,310
Fight on the outside...

1223
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:37,950
It's Marshy...

1224
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:38,650
He gets some of the...

1225
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:39,670
Immediate shots...

1226
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,370
On to Huskers...

1227
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,250
Cuts them on down...

1228
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:41,990
We'll go ahead...

1229
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,630
Back on up...

1230
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,290
He's trying to be able to...

1231
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:43,850
Take this fight...

1232
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,130
Your teammates on the other side...

1233
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,350
You have a real opportunity...

1234
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,630
To sandwich this bomb site...

1235
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,410
To try and come alive...

1236
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:50,250
And Marshy...

1237
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:51,810
Oh...

1238
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,090
Somehow does not die...

1239
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,250
To those first initial shots...

1240
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:54,390
Wait...

1241
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:54,870
Where's the...

1242
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:55,410
Where's the bomb?

1243
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,130
Oh...

1244
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,830
Oh my god...

1245
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,470
Yeah...

1246
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:01,170
Oh...

1247
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:02,990
Yeah...

1248
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:03,530
It's...

1249
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,430
It's literally...

1250
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,450
They just need...

1251
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,910
Jez to be alive...

1252
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:07,650
Like...

1253
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:09,310
I feel...

1254
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,270
This is so...

1255
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:12,950
Defender sided...

1256
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,030
I feel like this is...

1257
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,130
Like this map is...

1258
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,010
Defender sided...

1259
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,130
He's alive...

1260
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,450
And already defusing the bomb...

1261
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,250
He gets the kill...

1262
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:20,950
Immediately...

1263
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,210
What?

1264
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,410
What?

1265
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:23,950
Wait...

1266
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:24,550
Jez...

1267
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:24,930
What?

1268
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,210
The...

1269
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,510
Wampang prediction...

1270
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,630
Really using strategic approach in this game...

1271
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,150
Combined with...

1272
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:32,830
Just straight up being able to kill anybody...

1273
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,910
Within the blink of an eye...

1274
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:34,850
And you can see right now...

1275
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:35,550
On to the offense...

1276
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:35,930
The gamer...

1277
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:36,710
That was so cool...

1278
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,150
We actually got killed there...

1279
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:39,490
Haha...

1280
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:40,150
Marshy...

1281
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,180
Want to get this early contact...

1282
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,230
Get this early...

1283
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,790
Don't get...

1284
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,130
Oh...

1285
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:43,390
Oh...

1286
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:43,970
Marshy...

1287
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:44,570
You can't die...

1288
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,210
Marshy...

1289
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,790
Why did the Swiss...

1290
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:48,370
And...

1291
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:51,850
Marshy...

1292
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:52,710
If just like that...

1293
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,290
Blink of an eye...

1294
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,290
It was a full setup...

1295
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,130
Trying to get bombed out...

1296
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:56,850
It's just you...

1297
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,570
It's just you...

1298
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:00,970
Trying...

1299
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:02,430
Bro, he's one HP...

1300
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,870
I don't think he's gonna kill Jez...

1301
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:05,550
Yeah...

1302
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:06,030
What?

1303
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,530
Just not gonna be enough...

1304
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,250
Five...

1305
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:09,690
Two...

1306
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,210
From momentum...

1307
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:11,310
I...

1308
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:12,970
I just think this is very...

1309
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,510
Defense sided...

1310
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,630
I think if they are...

1311
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:16,030
The gas...

1312
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:16,910
They are...

1313
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:17,350
I mean...

1314
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,710
Those very attack side...

1315
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,550
Yeah...

1316
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:20,950
They are trying to take this map...

1317
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,290
And get us that arsenal hard point...

1318
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:23,690
And I do think the word they...

1319
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,390
Is gonna be the biggest thing here...

1320
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,010
It is a full team effort right now...

1321
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,550
Yes Jez...

1322
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,130
With almost 20...

1323
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:28,650
They swapped, right?

1324
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,350
But if you look at the other side...

1325
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,650
For our attackers right now...

1326
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:32,250
In gamers...

1327
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,710
It has not been a full team effort here...

1328
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:35,310
Finally...

1329
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,830
We do see a couple of eliminations...

1330
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:37,850
Across the board there...

1331
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:38,050
As I think...

1332
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:38,610
Actually it might...

1333
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,110
I don't know...

1334
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:39,850
It feels like...

1335
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,990
I feel like this is very defense side...

1336
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,210
In general...

1337
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:44,770
In our prior...

1338
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,130
Just cause like...

1339
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:46,850
A combination of...

1340
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:47,810
Now eight...

1341
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:48,430
As they do pick up another...

1342
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:49,290
Just cause it seems...

1343
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,030
Very easy to...

1344
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,110
Spread across the board...

1345
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,630
To kill the attackers...

1346
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:53,830
Man...

1347
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,250
He's popping off when he needs to...

1348
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,950
Finding himself eight kills of his own...

1349
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:57,270
So...

1350
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:57,730
Again...

1351
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:58,190
Right now...

1352
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:58,690
Momentum...

1353
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,070
Playing well as a team...

1354
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:00,590
Even though...

1355
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:01,650
Oh my god...

1356
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:01,810
Go!

1357
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:06,090
Oh my god...

1358
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,270
Oh my god...

1359
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:07,310
Oh my god...

1360
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:07,930
Guys...

1361
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:08,830
I think it's over...

1362
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,570
Jess is alive...

1363
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:11,910
And Marshy isn't...

1364
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,530
Jess is alive...

1365
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,290
And Marshy isn't...

1366
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,730
Oh no...

1367
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,290
The poor...

1368
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,110
Poor little guy...

1369
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,670
It's so...

1370
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,530
It's so...

1371
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,410
It's so over...

1372
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,030
The moment I saw...

1373
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:37,910
That Marshy was dead...

1374
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,150
I knew it was over...

1375
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:39,770
I...

1376
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:40,190
I...

1377
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:41,830
I...

1378
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:42,270
What if...

1379
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:44,010
Kill Search is...

1380
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:45,390
I like how Kill Search is like...

1381
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:46,510
What if Clutch?

1382
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:48,150
And then we're in the next round...

1383
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:49,030
I...

1384
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,970
It's a little too late for that...

1385
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:09,130
It's...

1386
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:09,230
We're...

1387
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:10,770
Really...

1388
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:11,630
This was...

1389
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:11,750
This...

1390
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:11,770
This...

1391
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:14,430
Jez is literally just baiting his entire team...

1392
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:14,830
Like...

1393
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:15,790
That's...

1394
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:16,470
That's...

1395
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:16,510
That's...

1396
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:16,890
That's all he...

1397
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,090
He's just been...

1398
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:21,210
He's literally baiting his entire team...

1399
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,830
Why can't Marshy do that?

1400
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,810
SACRIFICE MARSHI, NOOOOO!

1401
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:40,950
That was good, this team played really well there.

1402
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,950
I think Marshy's team isn't playing together right now.

1403
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:49,390
They're literally always... they're like so split for attack.

1404
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,710
Does it have a highlight reel or is it just watching Jez back, basically?

1405
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,850
Even they're like, is it just Jez?

1406
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:04,790
Even the capster is like...

1407
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,610
I told you!

1408
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:14,370
All they have to do is fake your teammates and search and destroy!

1409
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,610
Just fake your teammates!

1410
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:16,770
Maybe!

1411
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,530
Oops, all Jez!

1412
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:26,850
Just Jez!

1413
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:32,430
Jesus, that was such an insane shot.

1414
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:34,410
Look, there's Marshy though!

1415
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:35,790
It's not just Jez!

1416
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:43,790
I like how they're not including Jez in this highlight!

1417
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:46,290
They're like...

1418
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:50,770
They're trying so hard to only include one clip of Jez!

1419
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:58,870
Oh, nevermind!

1420
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,170
Oh, there's another Jez clip!

1421
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:01,430
Oh, there he is!

1422
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:03,110
And then they came up there!

1423
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:05,670
Jez has his own highlight!

1424
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:11,130
I'm surprised there's even clips that aren't Jez!

1425
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,230
Oh, there he is again!

1426
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,010
Nevermind!

1427
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:13,830
It was on...

1428
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:17,070
It was like five clips of Jez and then one...

1429
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:20,230
And then like two from Marshy and then like...

1430
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,570
The lucky two people get their own clip!

1431
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,250
He is exactly where he was going to be!

1432
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,630
He nails it perfectly!

1433
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,970
And not only does he do that, but he continues on with the unbelievable streak he has had!

1434
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,310
I think he dropped 50 in our first match!

1435
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:31,810
I think he dropped 50 in our first match!

1436
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:32,730
True, it should have been hard!

1437
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:36,790
And then he does, I think, either 20 or 30 again!

1438
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:38,330
He is on track!

1439
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:38,870
Actually, no!

1440
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,150
I think he's already passed the 100 points!

1441
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:43,030
Jez put this entire tournament in his highlight reel!

1442
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:46,150
This should be his highlight reel right now!

1443
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:57,970
Take his thumb sleeves!

1444
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,450
He's too good!

1445
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,150
Take his thumb sleeves!

1446
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,050
Make it more even!

1447
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,730
Give him the friction!

1448
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,230
Until basically that...

1449
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,770
It's not fair!

1450
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:15,810
Yes!

1451
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:18,990
It was neck and neck all the way through!

1452
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:22,290
Just a couple of those moments where basically they get some crucial kills!

1453
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,770
That doesn't allow momentum to get in on the point!

1454
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,170
And get in any of that time!

1455
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:27,430
Not the friction!

1456
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:31,990
Make him sweat on his Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra!

1457
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,250
Make him sweat on it!

1458
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,150
They're coming in with a lot of momentum!

1459
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:38,470
It's okay, they're built to be durable!

1460
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,030
He's trying to take this map four!

1461
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:43,110
Win it in a 3-1 to make it to our grand final!

1462
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:44,570
I kind of feel so...

1463
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:46,250
His thumbs will get shy!

1464
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:49,530
Check his...

1465
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:50,710
Check his fingers!

1466
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,070
Check his fingers!

1467
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,070
They are...

1468
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,150
Yeah, they are water resistant guys!

1469
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:57,590
They are water resistant!

1470
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,550
It kind of felt like...

1471
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:01,590
Is he using prosthetics?

1472
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:03,510
Enhanced...

1473
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:05,650
Prosthetics in hands of thumbplay?

1474
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:05,650
Okay?

1475
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,290
What is he hiding underneath the thumb's knees?

1476
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,630
Does he have aimbot underneath his thumbs?

1477
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:30,750
He was actually playing with like two, four thumbs.

1478
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:40,590
I feel like you have... I feel like... do you have to be like sort of ambidextrous...

1479
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:43,430
a little bit ambidextrous to be really good at mobile gaming?

1480
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:46,570
Because yeah, I guess like hand-eye coordination in general.

1481
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:52,330
But I feel like with mobile gaming, you definitely have to have more coordination versus just M&K.

1482
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:56,730
Pay no attention to that.

1483
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:00,890
If you take off the sleeve, it's just like a tinier person.

1484
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:05,090
It's like... it's like a mini person with like...

1485
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,830
like little hands and legs underneath.

1486
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:14,650
And it was being able to find those kills, convert it into hill time, and be able to take that map.

1487
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:15,430
But we are getting right...

1488
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:17,750
Yeah, you can't really... you can't really depend on one hand more.

1489
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,890
I feel like you have to have both... both your hands have to be like really...

1490
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,070
like coordinated for mobile.

1491
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:26,470
Around the world, I mean right here on the desk in this camera...

1492
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:28,350
are very excited to hop on into Arsenal.

1493
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,370
Let's get ready.

1494
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:30,970
It is map number four.

1495
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:31,570
Memento!

1496
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:33,170
You're going for a map four.

1497
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,310
This isn't a... this is actually a lot closer.

1498
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,870
Snug, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1499
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:39,270
Thank you.

1500
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:39,930
Thank you.

1501
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:45,050
Not only a good shot at doing that, but I think that it's going to be very telling how we start this map.

1502
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,490
I know we've talked a lot about that today.

1503
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:50,350
About, you know, putting your best foot forward and starting off in a sprint, not a jog.

1504
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,430
But I do think it's going to be even more important here.

1505
01:04:52,530 --> 01:05:00,350
Considering the fact that they have taken the momentum from the last two maps, have played really well through the last two, whether individually for Jez or the entire team that has played well as a collective...

1506
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,650
What are their team's names?

1507
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:05,350
Why is it just Jez?

1508
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,150
Jez plus friends.

1509
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:17,310
So for gamers here, do not let momentum get an early start, or you will have an early end to your tournament.

1510
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:18,950
Definitely got to keep it alive.

1511
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,870
That is for certain.

1512
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:25,590
Arsenal is going to be a very fun map to go ahead and dive on into.

1513
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:28,030
I believe five points on this map.

1514
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:29,750
Jez and et al.

1515
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,150
We are about ready.

1516
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,250
We are moments away from being able to hop on in.

1517
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:37,210
We just got to go ahead and resolve a quick little issue, and then we will be jumping on in.

1518
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:41,730
So you got to deal with us just for one more hot little second as we get ready to hop on in.

1519
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:44,430
Let's talk about some of the maps in this series, because we kicked it off.

1520
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:45,410
Yeah, what's the next one?

1521
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:46,510
With this summit hardpoint.

1522
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:49,050
And as we get ready to move on into the arsenal...

1523
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:50,410
Oh, they get to pick the map?

1524
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:51,530
On your screen.

1525
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,170
We kind of mentioned a lot of that, right?

1526
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:54,510
Yeah.

1527
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:56,790
And then we have, of course, that kill house with the 1v1...

1528
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:57,650
Jez and friends.

1529
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:58,650
...that we watched, of course.

1530
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,530
Jez really finally...

1531
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:03,930
It came down to the wire all the way at the end, but if I was able to really run away with it.

1532
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:12,690
And that was where we felt like momentum started getting the pendulum back into their corner as we then headed on into that express with a 7-2 victory.

1533
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:16,250
So if you are gamers right now, obviously, you are trying to take this arsenal.

1534
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:22,730
You're trying to push us all the way to a map number five, being Tunisia, which is a Call of Duty mobile original.

1535
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:23,750
So really only...

1536
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,070
It's just real.

1537
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:26,630
You're just living in it.

1538
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:32,890
You know, caster bias is not a thing I want to lean too far into, but gamers, I will do anything.

1539
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:37,630
I feel like that 1v1 that Marshy had with Jez, like...

1540
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:39,510
It, like, demoralized him.

1541
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,850
Because he got...

1542
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:44,650
He started playing incredibly aggressive after that 1v1.

1543
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:49,610
Like, he tried to, like, basically play like a hero.

1544
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:51,210
Like, he's like, I'm going to kill everybody.

1545
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:55,470
And then Jez was like, I'm going to let everyone else die, and then I'll kill everybody.

1546
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,810
What kind of processor does the Samsung Galaxy have?

1547
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,250
Oh, good question.

1548
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:08,890
It has...

1549
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:09,790
It has...

1550
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:13,230
Okay, it uses a Snapdragon 8 Elite.

1551
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:17,270
So apparently that's, like, the most advanced processor on the Galaxy phone.

1552
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,290
A Snapdragon 8 Elite.

1553
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,270
Yeah.

1554
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:21,310
Yeah.

1555
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:22,510
So you get fast...

1556
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:23,850
I mean, we've already seen the...

1557
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:26,410
The fast performance and smooth gameplay.

1558
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:28,330
It looks so smooth on...

1559
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:30,570
On this...

1560
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:31,430
On this stream.

1561
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:32,610
Like, it's so...

1562
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:33,410
You can't...

1563
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:34,270
It just looks incredible.

1564
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,330
The graphics looks really good.

1565
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,030
And the movement too!

1566
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:40,470
The fact that I played at 120 frames for this?

1567
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:40,810
At least $1,000.

1568
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:42,130
Loser.

1569
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:43,670
Not walking home empty-handed.

1570
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:47,030
17,500 for them.

1571
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:53,110
So definitely still would love to be able to get to that grand final to secure that cash.

1572
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:59,030
But it's not the only opportunity to earn some money today, because our two teams that do make it to our grand final...

1573
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:00,050
They're actually...

1574
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:00,790
Their captains are...

1575
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,930
But can it run, Crysis?

1576
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:03,570
What?

1577
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:04,630
But...

1578
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,350
I bet it can, honestly.

1579
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:15,890
Yeah, it's made to handle Unreal Engine 5.

1580
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,310
At this point, probably.

1581
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:27,070
Okay, that's the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra!

1582
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,110
Exclamation point, Samsung!

1583
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:31,350
Thank you again, Samsung!

1584
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,750
For these players to play for.

1585
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:35,810
And that is why we...

1586
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:36,470
I mean, it is.

1587
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,470
Like, 6k per player?

1588
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:40,710
That's like...

1589
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:42,310
That's rent money.

1590
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,410
That's money they...

1591
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,990
Oh, and they're in Las Vegas!

1592
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:52,550
They need that 6k for Las Vegas!

1593
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,670
I just realized.

1594
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:59,010
That 7-2 was one map off of instead of us having the day...

1595
01:08:59,010 --> 01:08:59,470
Vegas, baby!

1596
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,390
Teams are added...

1597
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,030
I mean, every team gets money, though.

1598
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:04,350
So it's third and fourth place.

1599
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,750
Third and fourth place gets money as well.

1600
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:13,570
Turn potential rent money in.

1601
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:14,650
Ha ha ha.

1602
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:15,170
Ha ha ha!

1603
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:16,030
Ha ha ha!

1604
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,930
Viva Las Vegas!

1605
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:23,810
They get to watch...

1606
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,010
Wait, isn't there like...

1607
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:26,830
Wait, is...

1608
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,550
What's her name?

1609
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:29,170
Um...

1610
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,990
Isn't Mariah Carey in Las Vegas?

1611
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:31,570
Performing...

1612
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:32,030
Oh, it's...

1613
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:32,610
I don't know.

1614
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:35,090
Wait, wasn't Britney Spears in Las Vegas?

1615
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:36,970
Who's performing in Las Vegas right now?

1616
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:46,330
They always have, like, one star, like, one celebrity in Las Vegas that's doing, like, performances there for, like, a year or something.

1617
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:47,530
I don't know.

1618
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:51,250
I might not be, like, hip with the times right now.

1619
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,370
They get to see... Oh my god!

1620
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,190
They get to see Magicians!

1621
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:59,270
Magic!

1622
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:03,550
And whoever won America's Got Talent!

1623
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,910
Sounder, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1624
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:07,190
Thank you.

1625
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,750
Okay, they always...

1626
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:15,550
In the, like, America's Got Talent, it's always, like, one of the first-place prize...

1627
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:18,730
Mind free!

1628
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:24,630
The first-place prize is always, like, a year tour in Las Vegas or something.

1629
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,510
The best of their ability.

1630
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,490
Enough of us yapping, I'm being told.

1631
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:31,530
Arsenal Hardpoint is ready to go.

1632
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:33,550
So, of course, we are looking at the gamers.

1633
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,510
This is do or die for them.

1634
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,070
And they need to clutch this one on up to bring...

1635
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,390
Okay, you still win 17.5k, though.

1636
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:42,390
How much did I get per player, guys?

1637
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:43,650
Human calculator!

1638
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:46,290
Calculate for me!

1639
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,210
17.5k divided by five.

1640
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,010
I'm waiting.

1641
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:53,650
And I think the wait is over.

1642
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:54,970
Let's get it started!

1643
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:58,490
As you mentioned, do or die for...

1644
01:10:58,490 --> 01:10:58,830
No!

1645
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:03,350
A lot!

1646
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:04,610
Guys, please!

1647
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:06,150
I can't math!

1648
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,610
I refuse!

1649
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:13,110
What if you guys don't have free will?

1650
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:16,730
All I need is one!

1651
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:17,890
Oh my god!

1652
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:20,970
They instantly killed four people!

1653
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:22,750
No help!

1654
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,410
Fergo dies.

1655
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:25,590
When the 2 comes on through, right?

1656
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:27,990
So, you're already see some early eliminations...

1657
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:29,090
No problem is the favor.

1658
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:29,930
Nice nade!

1659
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:32,270
We'll kick-start you there, as it is just...

1660
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:33,430
Okay, one point...

1661
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:33,770
Guys!

1662
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,990
There's so many different numbers that I actually don't know what's right.

1663
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,450
All right, guys!

1664
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:39,530
What is...

1665
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:40,630
What is...

1666
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,910
What is 17.5k divided by five?

1667
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:47,570
Too much math.

1668
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:56,810
Guys, bring out your Samsung Galaxy X25 Ultra phones and calculate for me.

1669
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:58,850
Between 3 and 4.

1670
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,170
3.5k?

1671
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:00,990
I knew it.

1672
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:01,790
I knew one of you guys.

1673
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,210
I knew a few of you will break.

1674
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,730
That's still a lot.

1675
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:05,530
3.5k?

1676
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:08,790
That's actual show money.

1677
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:09,950
You can see magic.

1678
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:14,250
Oh, this is Team Deathmatch.

1679
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,290
Jez, please.

1680
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:17,970
Oh.

1681
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:28,350
Jez has teammates that... Marshy has teammates that are picking up the kills, but Jez doesn't.

1682
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:29,630
Jez is a one-man show.

1683
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:36,910
Jesus.

1684
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:42,410
Bro, they're using... Okay, Jez... Marshy's team is actually using util.

1685
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:51,270
I think Marshy's team is better at using util.

1686
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:54,730
Bro, 35 to 18?

1687
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:57,970
Oh my god!

1688
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:01,450
Oh.

1689
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,490
Yeah.

1690
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:11,990
Yeah, Marshy's team is more playing as a team versus Jez's team.

1691
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:13,250
That's not going to be enough.

1692
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:14,070
That's not good.

1693
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,250
Marshy's team might have better individual players.

1694
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:19,870
Oh, is it hardpoint?

1695
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:21,070
Oh, it's hardpoint again?

1696
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,190
I was like, Jesus.

1697
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:24,770
56 to 18?

1698
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:25,710
There's so many.

1699
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,410
Yeah.

1700
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:29,650
Oh yeah, they did.

1701
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,030
Marshy's team did win last.

1702
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:32,530
Okay, then it'll be 2-2.

1703
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,490
What's after hardpoint again?

1704
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:37,650
Yeah, Jez can't...

1705
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:38,950
I think Jez is not good at...

1706
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,610
Jez's team right is not good at hardpoint.

1707
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:42,070
Keeping it contestant right now from...

1708
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:44,210
Uh, Marshy's team knows how to...

1709
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,670
Marshy's team knows how to, um...

1710
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:49,370
Defend better.

1711
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:52,810
It's going in up over the front, but that's three dead in the feed on the side of momentum.

1712
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:53,870
Jez, please!

1713
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,730
Okay, this is like a little embarrassing, Jez.

1714
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:00,270
I'm trying to be able to make sure...

1715
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,510
That your team can get back on into this...

1716
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:02,790
Jez, how can this...

1717
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:06,250
Jez, you can't put this in your highlight reel if you got knocked out.

1718
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:08,910
If you get third and fourth place.

1719
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:13,290
It kind of feels like right now, we are seeing gamers, as it looks like Marshy now gonna...

1720
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,770
I love it when they use the...

1721
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:19,010
When they use the grenade launcher, they're just like...

1722
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,050
They're just like, whatever.

1723
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:24,430
I don't want to aim anymore.

1724
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:26,350
What is he?

1725
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,930
What is Shifty?

1726
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:30,370
Shifty, are you?

1727
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:31,350
Sorry.

1728
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:32,770
Shifty's...

1729
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:36,570
This is what happens when you don't wear your thumb's knees.

1730
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:40,970
Oh, what if like...

1731
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,610
That's why he didn't wear his thumb's knees.

1732
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:43,590
And then like...

1733
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:44,690
You know how...

1734
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,530
Are you playing along?

1735
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,230
Like in like the water?

1736
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:51,870
Like, you know, he sweat...

1737
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:53,090
Maybe he sweats a lot?

1738
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:56,550
And then like the sweat like was touching the...

1739
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:58,690
The movement key a bit too long?

1740
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,850
Yeah, he got bit of the sweat on the screen.

1741
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:06,270
He's trying to hopefully catch somebody on that ladder hop-up.

1742
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:07,570
That's what I thought.

1743
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:08,570
I was like...

1744
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:09,790
Jez, are you okay?

1745
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,610
Aiden, surges on forward.

1746
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:12,990
We'll get that first blood.

1747
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:14,430
Already three dead in the feed.

1748
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:16,650
Four gamers momentum will answer on back.

1749
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:18,430
Here's kind of my worry bass.

1750
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:19,470
Is that, you know, momentum.

1751
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:20,390
They're doing a great job.

1752
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:21,670
They break these hills.

1753
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:23,110
They get on top of the point.

1754
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,470
But it's with 10 seconds left.

1755
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:25,870
You need to already be thinking about the next...

1756
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:25,990
Oh.

1757
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,830
Oh, is it going to rotate to the next point?

1758
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:31,870
Yeah, if you look at the mini map.

1759
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:36,950
Like, Marshy's team is like so much more coordinated when it comes to like hard points.

1760
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:40,630
Towards this point.

1761
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,330
Where's the next point?

1762
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:41,910
No.

1763
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:43,550
A huge win.

1764
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:44,990
Oh my god.

1765
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:45,830
They already killed everybody.

1766
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:48,790
They were set up on that rotation to cut everyone down.

1767
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:51,130
But the gamers win a crucial gunfight.

1768
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:52,390
They get on the end of this point.

1769
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:56,010
And it is just all shots going their way.

1770
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:58,090
As they've now crawled to a 60 point lead.

1771
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:00,730
This is a complete clip of the script of what we saw before.

1772
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,050
We talked about this in S&D of where it really was.

1773
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:04,750
Everybody on momentum carrying their weight.

1774
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:08,930
Individual players all finding themselves a decent amount of kills and a decent amount of strategery.

1775
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:10,530
That is not happening anymore.

1776
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:13,690
It is gamers instead who are doing that with almost every single player on the team.

1777
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:13,730
Jesus.

1778
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:14,990
At least 10 kills.

1779
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:17,930
The util for Marshy's team is so good.

1780
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:20,250
Because they keep their...

1781
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,270
They keep their...

1782
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:21,990
Look, look, look.

1783
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:24,790
It's literally one guy defending...

1784
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:26,710
Defending the point and stealth.

1785
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:28,030
Yeah, their team play is really good.

1786
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:29,970
They have really good coordination.

1787
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,430
They're definitely like talking.

1788
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:33,450
Calming a lot.

1789
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:34,410
We'll get caught on down.

1790
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:35,470
But thankfully the rest of the team...

1791
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:36,770
Yeah, this is a little...

1792
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:37,230
Just...

1793
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:38,030
This is a little embarrassing.

1794
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:39,770
Um...

1795
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:40,690
We might not have...

1796
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:42,130
You can't upload a highlight reel.

1797
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,610
You get four plays.

1798
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:51,430
It's like everybody is contributing.

1799
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,050
What the...

1800
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,070
How did he get three kills?

1801
01:16:58,170 --> 01:16:58,710
Wait, Marshy.

1802
01:16:58,810 --> 01:16:59,510
How did you...

1803
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:03,190
Marshy just got like four kills.

1804
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:04,510
What happened?

1805
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:06,950
What did he do?

1806
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:15,510
Michi, I think about two gifted subs.

1807
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:15,990
Thank you.

1808
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:16,670
Thank you.

1809
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:18,390
Yeah, we didn't see what he did.

1810
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:19,110
I was curious.

1811
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:20,070
Oh, wait.

1812
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,130
They got the point though.

1813
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:22,870
They have to rush it.

1814
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:24,550
Oh.

1815
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,050
They have to kill Jez.

1816
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,870
They can kill Jez and then like just walk in.

1817
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:32,070
I think if all of them just rushed him, I think it'd be fine.

1818
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:33,250
Oh, there you go.

1819
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,010
Jez down.

1820
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,970
Jez down.

1821
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:35,530
Go in.

1822
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:36,350
Go, go, go.

1823
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:37,750
Wait.

1824
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:38,630
Literally.

1825
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:40,070
Oh, wait.

1826
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:41,030
It literally was that.

1827
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:41,710
They're like...

1828
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:42,910
They just have to kill Jez.

1829
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:44,430
Jez down.

1830
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:45,390
Go, go, go.

1831
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,230
Raid boss down.

1832
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:49,610
Charge.

1833
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:51,010
You have to have your timing.

1834
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,630
Be a little bit better.

1835
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,030
P2 will come online.

1836
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:54,510
It's close.

1837
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:55,730
Oh, they got it back though.

1838
01:17:56,290 --> 01:17:56,850
They get it back?

1839
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:58,530
Yeah, they got it back.

1840
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:00,550
They have to go to the new point.

1841
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,630
Do you manage to find...

1842
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:03,130
Get him!

1843
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:04,410
Marshi, no!

1844
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:05,550
Rush him!

1845
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,530
Jez down!

1846
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:09,530
The plan.

1847
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:10,630
Go, Jez.

1848
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:12,550
Go, Jez.

1849
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,090
Wait, Jez's teammate.

1850
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,650
Oh my God, that guy.

1851
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:16,170
Wait.

1852
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:19,130
Did he see he...

1853
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:20,430
He dated himself.

1854
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:23,890
That's a doki move right there.

1855
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,010
Yeah, he missed the nade.

1856
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:28,570
Guys, that's a doki move right there.

1857
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:29,010
Yeah.

1858
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:32,770
That's me.

1859
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:36,090
That's me.

1860
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:37,830
I would do that.

1861
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,250
Jez is literally just fighting on point.

1862
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:42,150
He does not care.

1863
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:45,110
Oh yeah, that's a doki move.

1864
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:47,790
Wait, they're catching up.

1865
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:49,630
I think they really...

1866
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:51,950
I think Jez finally realized that he needs a team.

1867
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,030
Or he just locked in more.

1868
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:55,650
I can't tell.

1869
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:58,230
I can't tell if he's just more locked in or he's playing with his team.

1870
01:18:58,230 --> 01:18:58,970
When they need to.

1871
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,270
We talked about Hustlers, Nathan, Santana, Noemi.

1872
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:05,590
Having to make sure they get those shrink of kills when they are available.

1873
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:08,290
It's what allows the team to get the numbers advantage.

1874
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,610
Yeah, this is a Call of Duty mobile tournament.

1875
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:12,370
Hosted by...

1876
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:13,530
Presented by Samsung.

1877
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:15,590
Or the Samsung Galaxy.

1878
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:16,750
S25 Ultra.

1879
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:18,770
Exclamation point, Samsung!

1880
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:24,310
I don't think they should play patiently.

1881
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:25,990
They just literally need to rush Jez.

1882
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,530
They're playing way too patient for like...

1883
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:31,650
The actual gameplay that they have to do.

1884
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:33,910
He was going off the kill feed with that.

1885
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,110
But he gets stopped very, very quickly.

1886
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,630
You see Marshy just trying to hold this hunt.

1887
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:39,290
Oh, no!

1888
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:40,170
He's won!

1889
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:40,810
He's won!

1890
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:41,710
Get him!

1891
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:43,850
Oh, my God.

1892
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:45,450
Marshy should not have held that himself.

1893
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:47,190
It's okay.

1894
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:48,530
I think he's coming back now.

1895
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:49,830
I did it!

1896
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:50,650
Stop it again!

1897
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,690
I did!

1898
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,370
I don't...

1899
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:00,530
He just dated himself.

1900
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,950
That's a little embarrassing, bro.

1901
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,170
That's a little embarrassing.

1902
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:06,590
I think...

1903
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:07,710
Is there friendly fire?

1904
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:08,530
With nades?

1905
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:10,910
Guys, is there friendly fire?

1906
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:11,710
It's not bad.

1907
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:14,030
If there is, he actually killed...

1908
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:14,390
Oh, no.

1909
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:14,910
Thank God.

1910
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:15,290
Okay.

1911
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,990
Wouldn't it be funny if he killed his team there?

1912
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:21,290
Down.

1913
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:24,230
And that's what we're seeing here.

1914
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:25,770
We warned about it coming into the map.

1915
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,350
That you cannot allow these leads to grow too large.

1916
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,150
Because if you do, the comeback is just going to be...

1917
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:30,910
Oh.

1918
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,130
Oh, that's a little embarrassing.

1919
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,450
I feel like...

1920
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:38,490
I feel...

1921
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:39,410
Oh my God.

1922
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:41,750
I feel like you should be able to.

1923
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:43,590
Oh, it's...

1924
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:44,730
The lead's too big again.

1925
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:50,650
If they even find a handful more of points, it will be difficult for momentum to ever stifle them again.

1926
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:52,430
Oh, you can even see on the top of your screen.

1927
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:53,030
Where's the point?

1928
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:53,570
Oh, it's over there.

1929
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:55,970
Oh, that was a good shot from Huskers.

1930
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:59,030
Jesus.

1931
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:01,770
55 to 40 versus 49.

1932
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:07,070
The second best...

1933
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,450
Jez's second best teammate has 17 kills.

1934
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:12,050
For now, they are going to go ahead and sit into that point.

1935
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:14,890
They'll be 20 points away from taking this map.

1936
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:16,210
Oh, a new point.

1937
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,690
New point.

1938
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:19,410
I still think...

1939
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:20,470
Marshy has better...

1940
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:21,430
Has better teammates.

1941
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:23,030
Wait, actually?

1942
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,690
No, Huskers with 22 kills.

1943
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:27,170
It's hard to tell, actually.

1944
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:28,910
Whoa!

1945
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,630
Oh, he has a killstreak.

1946
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:32,910
Oh!

1947
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:36,810
That was good.

1948
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:39,030
That was really good.

1949
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,490
Do you find a fourth?

1950
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:42,650
You might be able to, but Marshy...

1951
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:44,550
Oh, it didn't matter.

1952
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,990
His teammates died.

1953
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:49,090
And he got four kills.

1954
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:51,430
And his teammates still died.

1955
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:54,130
This is how you crash out.

1956
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:59,750
This is when...

1957
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:02,850
This is when you don't pick off of vibes, guys.

1958
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:03,950
This is...

1959
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:09,010
Oh, baby.

1960
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,450
Maybe a triple.

1961
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:12,290
Is...

1962
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,770
This is GG.

1963
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:21,290
Oh, it's two to two, though.

1964
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,550
It's two to two.

1965
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:27,230
Just learns today.

1966
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,290
You never pick off of vibes.

1967
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:31,090
Three more points.

1968
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:31,870
Make it two.

1969
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:33,450
Make it not one.

1970
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:34,390
Somehow momentum.

1971
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:35,250
Hold them off.

1972
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:38,670
And with only a two-point gap remaining, they're still in this thing.

1973
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:40,230
They need the...

1974
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:40,750
They just need...

1975
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:40,970
Oh!

1976
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,630
You're looking at this.

1977
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:43,250
Oh, no.

1978
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:44,850
140 points.

1979
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:46,590
Wait, they're coming over.

1980
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:47,970
What was that?

1981
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,590
What was that?

1982
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,330
Try and come back on in.

1983
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:52,090
It's still not...

1984
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:52,950
Oh, they got it.

1985
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:54,070
They got the point.

1986
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:56,030
With Marshy going in...

1987
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,390
Marshy got another point.

1988
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:59,290
He's trying to gas him up, and he's just locked on in.

1989
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,390
He's like, wait, let me get a screenshot of this real quick.

1990
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,410
This is going to go in the timeline.

1991
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:03,750
Let me go ahead.

1992
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:04,850
Let me snag that on him.

1993
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:07,830
You can see Adrian hyped, bringing the energy shifty.

1994
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:09,570
I know he's electric right now.

1995
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:11,130
Freeboy and Nyksta.

1996
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:13,890
They have to come to that map as well to come online.

1997
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,030
Feeling good.

1998
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:16,290
Looks like the team is happy.

1999
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:17,230
The comms are there.

2000
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,410
Is that Marshy?

2001
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:20,030
With the finger sleeves?

2002
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:22,590
It has to be Marshy, right?

2003
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:23,910
We were on search and destroy.

2004
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:25,070
I assume the...

2005
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:26,390
You look great for your team.

2006
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:30,210
Yeah, and I think that's why Marshy's not taking too much time to celebrate here.

2007
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:32,530
He knows that, yeah, we might have been able to win the hard...

2008
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:34,250
Oh, he's the one that's like...

2009
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,010
Wait!

2010
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:37,030
I like his...

2011
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:40,290
That they're like, yeah, Marshy's not celebrating just yet.

2012
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:46,530
Like, he's the only one that didn't even look up from his phone, because he was like, it's not over.

2013
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:47,750
It's...

2014
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:50,810
He was like...

2015
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:52,510
Then this rest of the team was like, yay!

2016
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:53,710
Yippee!

2017
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:59,370
And then Marshy's just like, it's not over.

2018
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:01,310
It's not over.

2019
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,170
Arsenal hardpoint definitely did not disappoint.

2020
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:05,150
Yeah, he's locked in.

2021
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,630
Like, they're on, like, Marshy's backpack right now.

2022
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:09,690
It's like, yippee!

2023
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:10,750
We did it!

2024
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:14,010
Huge plays.

2025
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:16,770
Predator missile double kill into a solid one.

2026
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:19,730
But, yeah, this ending from Marshy was absolutely insane.

2027
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:20,730
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

2028
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:21,530
Guys, I'll be back.

2029
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,610
The war machine going crazy.

2030
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:27,030
It's the killstreaks going crazy.

2031
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,410
It's everything.

2032
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:29,990
Notice, Marshy didn't even fist bump.

2033
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:32,450
She was like, come on, guys!

2034
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:33,310
We did it!

2035
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:34,230
Fist bump!

2036
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:37,490
And Marshy didn't even look up to say, good job.

2037
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,550
All the way to a game number five in the second.

2038
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:40,590
It's really the best of both worlds.

2039
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:42,110
Hey, are you not entertained?

2040
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:44,630
It's the only thing I can ask at this point here.

2041
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,450
And I also have an ask of our production team.

2042
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:47,710
I need somebody on the background.

2043
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,270
I know graphics is probably already doing way too many things.

2044
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:54,250
But if you can find a way to figure out how many kills we've got, Jez versus Marshy right now.

2045
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:57,670
Dude, I think both of them are at least at triple digits at this point.

2046
01:24:57,810 --> 01:24:59,010
So, let's find out.

2047
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:01,570
Can they break through those three digits and get to four?

2048
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:04,050
I don't think so, but we can determine a winner.

2049
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:06,350
Our fifth and final game here.

2050
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:11,730
The winner of this will move on to the grand final here for the Samsung Galaxy Gear Up Cup.

2051
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:17,370
And will guarantee themselves at least a 1v1 battle for $15,000 for the captain.

2052
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:21,250
If that isn't enough encouragement, I don't know what is.

2053
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:21,610
Yeah.

2054
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:27,450
Lock in, friends, because this is absolutely electric that we have coming on in Tunisia.

2055
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:29,650
A Call of Duty Mobile Original.

2056
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:32,630
I do kind of wonder when we think back to Express.

2057
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:36,270
A lot of our players, they might have some sort of reps just from back in the day.

2058
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:36,630
I'm back.

2059
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:38,830
They've played the map before.

2060
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:40,350
They know how it looks and plays.

2061
01:25:40,490 --> 01:25:44,810
But for some of these players, they might be loading into Tunisia for the very first time.

2062
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,250
They might have no idea how this map plays.

2063
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,170
I don't move around.

2064
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:53,070
So, I'm going to look at our captains to start distilling some of that information of where to look.

2065
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:54,110
Where do we want to play?

2066
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,130
Where do we want to hang out?

2067
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,910
Wait, what did they say was next?

2068
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:57,990
Game mode.

2069
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:01,070
Guys, you guys hear what they said it was?

2070
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:02,030
Very early on.

2071
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:07,810
I hope you at least load it up into a custom game on Tunisia to be able to at least get a feel for the map.

2072
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:09,830
Be able to see what's there.

2073
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,310
How do you want to hold on in?

2074
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:11,750
Not yet?

2075
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:12,030
Okay.

2076
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:13,150
Let's get it started, folks.

2077
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:14,530
We are hopping right on in.

2078
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:15,670
Search and destroy.

2079
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:15,910
Oh.

2080
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:21,250
Bro, that's why Marshy was so locked in.

2081
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:24,750
Marshy was like, no.

2082
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:30,330
Oh, boy.

2083
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:31,990
It was a two-to-two.

2084
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:32,990
Oh, boy.

2085
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:33,830
Oh, boy.

2086
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:35,390
And then all of a sudden...

2087
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:36,950
Marshy just beat your teammates.

2088
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:39,430
And things started to turn.

2089
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:40,190
Momentum.

2090
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,310
Marshy is scared.

2091
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,630
With all the momentum in the world in their favor.

2092
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:45,450
Oh, they got first.

2093
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:46,690
Oh, the provide.

2094
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:48,730
Jazz's team got first kill.

2095
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:50,130
Yep.

2096
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,050
That's why.

2097
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:54,590
What?

2098
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:55,050
Okay.

2099
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:57,570
So, at least, like...

2100
01:26:57,570 --> 01:27:01,010
From the gamers, two members do get found out from...

2101
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:02,210
Oh, Marshy did get two.

2102
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:03,530
You might have a timing here.

2103
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:05,290
Adrian, you might have an opportunity.

2104
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:06,270
Drop some down.

2105
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:06,930
Drop some there.

2106
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:09,530
But you're not able to finish the kill.

2107
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:10,470
Oh!

2108
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:12,390
No, no.

2109
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:12,950
It's just...

2110
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:13,270
Okay.

2111
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:15,690
Oh, Jazz is one HP.

2112
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:16,710
Wait.

2113
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:18,030
He's getting healed.

2114
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:20,410
Oh, my God.

2115
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:23,170
Wait.

2116
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:24,410
Is there, like...

2117
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:25,550
There's regen, right?

2118
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:26,510
Oh, my God.

2119
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:27,510
He's just regen-ing.

2120
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,550
But he has 47 seconds.

2121
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:34,990
What?

2122
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,050
What was that?

2123
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:39,450
He was, like...

2124
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:40,690
You could tell he got scared.

2125
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:44,490
Oh, they dropped bomb.

2126
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:45,790
30 seconds.

2127
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:46,970
Oh, my God.

2128
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:49,890
Oh, that was good.

2129
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:50,850
That was a good guard.

2130
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,830
That was good, actually.

2131
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:53,450
This chat was good.

2132
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:57,890
I thought that we might be seeing the 2v1 go completely against them with the maneuvers.

2133
01:27:57,890 --> 01:27:59,350
Jez was so fast, though.

2134
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:01,110
Like, he was zooming.

2135
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:03,810
Yeah, that teamwork was really good.

2136
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,530
Because their captain was down.

2137
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:07,630
He can't win the fight, but you're starting to see...

2138
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:09,050
He was all right.

2139
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:13,330
He was all right.

2140
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:19,490
Whether it be the individual player going into the 2v1 or the two players that are trying to set up counter angles to the final player remaining.

2141
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:22,770
Really serious stuff here in our final map of this fight.

2142
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:23,730
He zooms, though.

2143
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:25,170
Let's see if it keeps going, though.

2144
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:27,170
Noemi, not recognizing shifting there.

2145
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:28,890
And that's the first deal of round number two.

2146
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:31,050
Yeah, I mean, if you're not really familiar with the map...

2147
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:31,830
What happened?

2148
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:33,750
What?

2149
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:40,390
Oh, wait.

2150
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:44,890
I think it's more a defend-sided, honestly.

2151
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:48,490
Because, like, Jez's team did really well in defend.

2152
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:50,230
In general.

2153
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:56,710
Jez is actually just doing everything.

2154
01:28:58,890 --> 01:29:01,990
Marshy's found, and yet again, just Adrian alive.

2155
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:02,790
Just like that?

2156
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,590
Tall ass for Lil' A.

2157
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:08,850
Team up 2-0.

2158
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:09,550
Adrian?

2159
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:10,830
What's Adrian doing?

2160
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:12,770
He tries to rush on, but he has Aiden there.

2161
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:13,510
He's got Jez there.

2162
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,470
He's got the whole team.

2163
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:20,490
I just ran past him.

2164
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:22,310
I was like, who is he?

2165
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:26,790
Was that Bane?

2166
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:30,530
Bro, the other guy was like, huh?

2167
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:35,190
Bro, I don't know if he was a...

2168
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:36,210
Was that a strat?

2169
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:40,010
It's like, you know when they, like, sent...

2170
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:45,330
Oh, you know how when they, like, sent a clone out, but they, like, Jez sent a real person out?

2171
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:49,070
Jez, though, looking to try an answer on back.

2172
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:49,930
Machine pistol.

2173
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:51,350
It's a little bit too hot.

2174
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,210
The accidental strat.

2175
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:55,490
Where did he go?

2176
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:58,750
I can't tell if he was a bait or not.

2177
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:01,210
Maybe take out the main man himself and Marshy.

2178
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:03,410
He's gonna smartly not take that fight, though.

2179
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:04,950
Yeah, he knows that's Marshy.

2180
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:08,030
He saw the movement, and he's like, I'll wait here.

2181
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,170
He's like, I'll wait here.

2182
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:15,430
I know who that is.

2183
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:24,510
Oh, Jez has to 1v3 now.

2184
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:28,530
That sucks, because his Mi Shields are all dead.

2185
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:30,910
His Mi Shields keep dying before he can use them.

2186
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,110
I think...

2187
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,210
How many points is it?

2188
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:44,030
I don't remember.

2189
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:50,710
No, he didn't have the bomb.

2190
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:53,670
Like, his teammates who have the bomb.

2191
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:54,510
I feel like...

2192
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:57,650
I feel like Jez should have the bomb.

2193
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:58,870
Honestly.

2194
01:30:59,470 --> 01:31:03,710
I feel like his team just dies way too fast.

2195
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:07,510
I think that they got a handful of wins in the last S&D and did so in a pretty meaningful way.

2196
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,630
Like, I know Jez is, like, their team...

2197
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,810
Their, like, fragger.

2198
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:14,090
But, like, at this point, it feels like...

2199
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:16,550
It feels like Jez should hold on to it.

2200
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:18,730
And getting those early picks repeatedly.

2201
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:21,010
This time it is age-free, and usually it is...

2202
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:22,190
Oh, oh, a target 7.

2203
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:23,290
Oh, that's what it means.

2204
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:25,190
Sorry, I'm dumb.

2205
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:27,110
This time, though, it's more trades than anything else.

2206
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:28,630
Both teams down to two players.

2207
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:29,190
2-2.

2208
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:33,690
Good job, though, from gamers to not let that lead get away from them when it comes to the lives.

2209
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:35,970
So, being able to even on up and do a 2v2 is here.

2210
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:37,050
Oh.

2211
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:38,550
Marshall's down!

2212
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:39,410
It's over!

2213
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:40,810
It's over!

2214
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:43,990
Is there, like...

2215
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:44,050
What?

2216
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:44,810
Oh, wait.

2217
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:45,410
Just go to B.

2218
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:47,530
Why don't they just go to B?

2219
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:47,870
Yeah.

2220
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:49,550
Yeah, I was just like...

2221
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:50,070
Just go B.

2222
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:52,810
I'm planning.

2223
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:55,310
You know I'm planning?

2224
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:57,050
I was gonna be like...

2225
01:31:57,050 --> 01:31:57,830
Are you okay?

2226
01:31:58,790 --> 01:31:59,570
I like this.

2227
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:01,170
Jez is just kind of sliding around.

2228
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:06,290
Trying to run at an intense pace just to clear out any of these angles.

2229
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:09,510
And, well, Jez has a strong opportunity.

2230
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:10,150
Oh?

2231
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:10,770
Oh?

2232
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:12,510
You might catch him on the cross.

2233
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:13,490
I don't know if you did.

2234
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:14,970
Okay.

2235
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:16,090
Nice little nade there.

2236
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:17,970
Is Aiden gonna die from the frag?

2237
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:20,750
I swear to God, if I see Aiden...

2238
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:22,630
I was like...

2239
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:23,870
Aiden, move!

2240
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,190
I was like...

2241
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:29,610
Why is he just standing there?

2242
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:30,950
Did he take the nade?

2243
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:34,390
Oh, ow.

2244
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:37,690
I was like...

2245
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:38,330
What is he doing?

2246
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:39,710
Why is he...

2247
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:41,110
I guess he missed.

2248
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:42,930
Yeah, how did you miss that?

2249
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:49,790
Yeah, you're...

2250
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:50,690
I feel like...

2251
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,350
This is what I also don't like about Search and Destroy game mode.

2252
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:56,330
Is that you have to have really good map knowledge.

2253
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:58,070
I hate...

2254
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,310
Like, I hate lurkers.

2255
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:03,950
It's what's created such a contentious and close start to this match.

2256
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:03,970
Ooh.

2257
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:08,990
Again, this was the tipping point for momentum last time.

2258
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:10,670
And they are the ones with the first kill here.

2259
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:11,270
Oh!

2260
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:11,730
Did it...

2261
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:13,070
Jez got two.

2262
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:14,830
Yeah, this is what started to happen.

2263
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:16,050
Oh, is that the AWP?

2264
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:16,970
Wait, did he AWP that?

2265
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:19,730
We're gonna start seeing the same thing here on Tunisia.

2266
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:20,490
It was...

2267
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:21,310
Did he AWP that?

2268
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:23,690
No, I don't hate...

2269
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:24,690
I don't hate...

2270
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,310
...stream lurkers.

2271
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:27,130
I hate...

2272
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:29,430
...tactical shooter lurkers.

2273
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:30,490
...who just...

2274
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:31,330
...who just...

2275
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:33,910
...walk to the other side.

2276
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:35,730
And then just stay there.

2277
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:38,850
No, guys.

2278
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:39,750
Oh my god.

2279
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:41,150
Wait, Marshy just killed three.

2280
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:41,810
Or two?

2281
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:44,750
Wait, where's the bomb?

2282
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:48,930
Guys, any lurkers in my chat?

2283
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:51,010
You guys are pretty cool too.

2284
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:52,990
Okay.

2285
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:54,570
Broku, you're not a lurker.

2286
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:55,770
You type in chat.

2287
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:01,450
There's a lurker.

2288
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:02,810
That's right.

2289
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:03,590
You know what?

2290
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:06,430
Since you're a lurker, I'll give you VIP.

2291
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,470
Guys, that's how much I love lurkers.

2292
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:12,490
And now my entire chat will start lurking.

2293
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:12,990
I'm joking.

2294
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:13,850
Don't do that.

2295
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:15,790
No way.

2296
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:22,070
All right, guys.

2297
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,590
You failed my first test.

2298
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:25,590
A lurker will continue lurking.

2299
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:28,990
Now that you've typed in my chat, you're no longer a lurker.

2300
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:31,290
So no VIP for you.

2301
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:33,730
True.

2302
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:39,450
No more lurking.

2303
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,930
You failed the first test.

2304
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:43,450
Got him.

2305
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:45,650
Into a 1v4.

2306
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:47,490
Oh, you know the...

2307
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:48,330
Wait, what happened?

2308
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:50,390
I looked away for one second.

2309
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:53,030
It's not going down like this again.

2310
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:53,910
Because I'll be real.

2311
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:55,890
I was starting to think it might be.

2312
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:57,190
But momentum, look.

2313
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,010
What happened?

2314
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,510
I literally turned around for one second.

2315
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:03,670
Yeah, I mean, listen.

2316
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:06,190
It's, uh...

2317
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:09,050
No surprise to see some of these players...

2318
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:10,910
Three people die to a name?

2319
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:14,310
It's all about the mid-round adjustments in the search and destroy maps.

2320
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:17,410
And it seems like, obviously, Shifty had a strong idea.

2321
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:17,750
At least...

2322
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:19,010
The guys are really cool, though, I admit.

2323
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:20,750
Where you drop the grenade.

2324
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:20,830
Yeah.

2325
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:23,070
It turns out you get three for free.

2326
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:24,810
You immediately put this back in.

2327
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:25,930
What is it?

2328
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:28,650
You have planted the bomb.

2329
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:30,350
I like the prone.

2330
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:31,370
The prone's funny.

2331
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:34,910
He's like, where did he go?

2332
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:36,890
I think so fast.

2333
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:38,370
Where did he go?

2334
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:39,090
Oh!

2335
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:41,150
Oh!

2336
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:44,010
Maybe I spoke too soon.

2337
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:44,710
No!

2338
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:46,910
We got him!

2339
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:50,350
See, just what I mean!

2340
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:54,870
All he had to do was just walk behind him.

2341
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:56,590
The Call of Duty Opal Pro.

2342
01:35:56,850 --> 01:35:58,230
Take a series of 1v1s.

2343
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:00,110
I know we have some talented players here.

2344
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:00,970
You're not...

2345
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:03,410
All he did was just walk behind him.

2346
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:05,550
Half a second there, I really believed.

2347
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:06,830
I thought it was gonna happen.

2348
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:07,550
That was insane.

2349
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:08,930
That was a really good shot.

2350
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:13,730
If they don't push this together, I'm guaranteeing him taking each of these 1v1s.

2351
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:15,250
And luckily enough, they didn't do that.

2352
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:19,190
Again, gamers playing a lot more cohesively right now on the second search...

2353
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:20,790
I'm gonna grab...

2354
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:21,490
Wait, let me check.

2355
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:24,310
The problem is that the snipers seem to be reigning supreme.

2356
01:36:24,450 --> 01:36:27,570
Whether it's Jez or Marshy, they are getting these early picks almost every day.

2357
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:28,430
Oh my god, is that an AWP?

2358
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:31,030
Yeah, I mean, this is why we love snipers in-call.

2359
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:31,430
Jesus.

2360
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:33,130
Especially search and destroy.

2361
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:34,670
You're able to watch these crosses.

2362
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:38,130
You're able to bring these first bloods into your favor.

2363
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:39,310
Tied up.

2364
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:39,990
3-3 right now.

2365
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:41,370
The movement is so scary.

2366
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:46,090
They're AWPing across.

2367
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:47,690
The classic.

2368
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:49,210
This one's intense.

2369
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:53,250
This map...

2370
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:55,440
feels like it's much more...

2371
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:56,450
even.

2372
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:58,370
Versus...

2373
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:00,110
Oh!

2374
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:02,490
Oh my god!

2375
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:03,910
Wait, did he nade that?

2376
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:06,210
I don't know, I think it's over.

2377
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:07,830
Jez is down.

2378
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:12,050
Ohhhh...

2379
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:13,710
You put it away.

2380
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:14,990
You find yourself up.

2381
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:15,550
4-3.

2382
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:17,010
They keep getting naded.

2383
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:18,850
I think, like...

2384
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:20,270
Marshy's team...

2385
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:22,750
is smarter because they don't group...

2386
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,470
like...

2387
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:25,770
in search and destroy, they don't group up.

2388
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:28,110
So, they don't get, like, randomly naded.

2389
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:31,570
Jez's team is, like, for some reason, all, like...

2390
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:33,250
congested into one area.

2391
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:33,810
Somehow.

2392
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:35,150
I don't know how they keep doing that.

2393
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:35,810
I...

2394
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:37,350
I don't understand.

2395
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:39,710
...where everybody has at least 4 or 5.

2396
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:41,150
Look on the other side for momentum.

2397
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:45,350
And again, it is still struggle bus from everybody but Jez.

2398
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:46,410
He has almost 20 kills.

2399
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:46,990
What?

2400
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:49,130
And as high as on his team, not even 4.

2401
01:37:49,950 --> 01:37:50,250
Yeah.

2402
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:50,710
Yeah.

2403
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:52,410
Jez is helping...

2404
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:53,690
They don't know the map, too.

2405
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:57,030
I think it's also because they don't know the map as well.

2406
01:37:57,990 --> 01:37:59,650
Jez was seen pistol in the hand.

2407
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,430
Like, Jez has, like...

2408
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:03,670
is literally, like, carrying his entire team right now.

2409
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:05,610
Like...

2410
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:06,750
Like...

2411
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,750
His team...

2412
01:38:08,290 --> 01:38:08,730
Aw...

2413
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:10,150
His team doesn't push with him!

2414
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:12,430
Another kill onto Huskers, and just like that...

2415
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:14,250
His team doesn't push with him!

2416
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:15,310
He has to, like...

2417
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:17,770
He has to, like...

2418
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:18,150
1...

2419
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:20,310
1v5 everybody all the time.

2420
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:21,830
So the fact that the gamers are...

2421
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:25,030
They either die before the push, or they don't push with him.

2422
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:26,750
If you really want to...

2423
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:27,650
As long as you get that...

2424
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:29,450
Marshy's team's actually all getting kills.

2425
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:30,030
You can tell.

2426
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,670
Jez's team only, like, 1 kill.

2427
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:33,670
1, 1, 2.

2428
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:34,770
He's a load.

2429
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:39,270
Jez, what happened?

2430
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:41,370
You used to be so good at baiting!

2431
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:42,210
What happened?

2432
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:42,610
What happened?

2433
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:43,130
Get those kills.

2434
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:44,310
Adrian's gonna take one.

2435
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:45,750
Marshy's gonna get one as well.

2436
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:51,090
Unfortunately, Adrian will go down for the trade here as Jez is still continuing to be a force to be reckoned with.

2437
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:55,230
Noemi, though, might have shown more than she should have as Marshy's got the rotation out.

2438
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:59,150
If he can find her, he's got the kill, but he said they're gonna play patiently.

2439
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:01,690
And it's actually gonna be a trade across the board.

2440
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:03,250
Shifty and Jez, the last two.

2441
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:03,910
It's one view.

2442
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:04,470
Oh!

2443
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:07,930
Oh, Shifty!

2444
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:12,170
Shifty actually got the rainbows down!

2445
01:39:15,370 --> 01:39:16,630
Jez, come on!

2446
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:19,530
You used to be such a good beater!

2447
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:21,650
What happened?

2448
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:23,790
Oh, man.

2449
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:25,250
They're falling apart.

2450
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:28,430
They're falling apart.

2451
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:30,450
Guys, I think it's over.

2452
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:32,770
I think it's over.

2453
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,630
They're falling apart.

2454
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:38,950
Just no more.

2455
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:40,370
No highlight reel.

2456
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:46,550
No highlight reel for you, I guess.

2457
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:52,090
Oh, unless...

2458
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:55,410
Okay, Husker's actually fragging now.

2459
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:03,510
Well, they have the bomb.

2460
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:04,850
They don't have to move anywhere.

2461
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,330
Jez doesn't care.

2462
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:11,450
Jez doesn't care.

2463
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:13,150
He's like, where are you?

2464
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:16,470
Oh, my God.

2465
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:21,830
Jez is like, where is he?

2466
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:27,410
I didn't scared.

2467
01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:28,610
Oh, why?

2468
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:30,170
Why?

2469
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:30,630
Just...

2470
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:30,930
Why?

2471
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:32,910
Just...

2472
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:34,210
Fight on the bomb!

2473
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:36,870
Okay, Jez is fighting on the bomb now.

2474
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:37,750
He's not moving anymore.

2475
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:39,690
He knows he's lost too many people.

2476
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:40,750
Stop moving!

2477
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:42,850
Stop moving!

2478
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:48,110
Like, why...

2479
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:49,530
Why would you move?

2480
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:51,090
You know where the bomb is.

2481
01:40:57,010 --> 01:40:58,230
Oh, my God.

2482
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:01,910
Okay, his teammates are actually so stupid.

2483
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:03,270
Like, for that play.

2484
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:05,050
I feel like...

2485
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:06,010
I feel like...

2486
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:08,850
Like, that play was actually dumb for his team to do.

2487
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:10,750
Like, just stay where the bomb is.

2488
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:11,630
You don't have to hunt.

2489
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:14,870
Especially when you know Marshy's the one that's...

2490
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:16,990
Like, at that point, like, Marshy's hunting you.

2491
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:17,650
You're probably like...

2492
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:17,910
No, dude.

2493
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:18,750
You actually are.

2494
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:20,170
You cannot be taken down.

2495
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:21,450
Oh!

2496
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:22,190
Oh, my goodness.

2497
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:23,810
A little critical earlier.

2498
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:25,350
Oh, my God.

2499
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:26,290
And a two.

2500
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:28,010
And a wallbang.

2501
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:29,090
And a wallbang.

2502
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,030
Okay, that...

2503
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:31,530
That is insane.

2504
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:33,310
That is a really good...

2505
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:34,550
That is a good kill.

2506
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:36,070
He needed that.

2507
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,710
I hope it goes 6-6.

2508
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:39,470
I really hope it goes 6-6.

2509
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:40,790
Because, like...

2510
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:43,050
That's an insane lineup.

2511
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:45,990
This shit...

2512
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:46,410
I want...

2513
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:48,350
I want this to be a...

2514
01:41:48,350 --> 01:41:48,970
Um...

2515
01:41:48,970 --> 01:41:49,550
6-6.

2516
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:53,690
He just needs to win one more...

2517
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:54,950
After this.

2518
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:57,970
Okay.

2519
01:41:58,850 --> 01:41:59,390
No...

2520
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:01,950
Noemi needs to stop running in a straight line.

2521
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:08,230
All I'm saying is that...

2522
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:09,990
Whoever is Noemi...

2523
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,690
They need to stop running in a straight line.

2524
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:13,390
Yeah.

2525
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:16,370
You gotta win those two rounds in...

2526
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:17,770
The fact that...

2527
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:19,730
That they survived that was...

2528
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:20,970
It was an accomplishment.

2529
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:25,650
They mess up in...

2530
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:26,770
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2531
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:27,790
Not that Nance.

2532
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:30,810
Oh!

2533
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:31,710
She's down!

2534
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:32,250
Wait!

2535
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:33,710
Wait, it could...

2536
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:34,170
Okay, wait.

2537
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:34,910
I don't want to jinx it.

2538
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:35,650
Caster's curse.

2539
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:37,710
I hope it goes to 6-6, though.

2540
01:42:37,710 --> 01:42:39,270
There's at least one down.

2541
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:40,270
Why did he not shoot?

2542
01:42:41,810 --> 01:42:42,670
Oh, no.

2543
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:43,470
Husker's down.

2544
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:44,510
Husker's their best player.

2545
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:45,110
Their second...

2546
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:46,090
Their actual best player.

2547
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:49,670
That's not good.

2548
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:50,090
Yeah.

2549
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:52,210
Oh!

2550
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:53,510
All of a sudden...

2551
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:56,590
May not seem like Aiden wants to stay out of the conversation.

2552
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:58,210
Husker's and Jez have gotten a ton.

2553
01:42:58,430 --> 01:43:01,710
But goodness me, Jez and Aiden combining for a heck of a lot.

2554
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:02,730
Just Adrian left.

2555
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:04,730
We may see some overtime.

2556
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:06,430
I like how you say Jez and Aiden...

2557
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,130
The curse.

2558
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:09,230
Wait, someone help me.

2559
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:10,710
Oh, Aiden did it!

2560
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:13,330
Aiden did it!

2561
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:16,210
It's over time.

2562
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:19,450
It's over time now.

2563
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:20,950
Oh, games are rough...

2564
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:21,490
Tough now.

2565
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:22,690
They tie us on up.

2566
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:23,050
So...

2567
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:24,590
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

2568
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:26,010
It is a win by...

2569
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:26,870
Final round!

2570
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:28,630
From here on out.

2571
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:31,190
This is not like your classic multiplayer search and destroy.

2572
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:32,250
There is no...

2573
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:32,810
Oh, my God.

2574
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:34,070
These lineups are crazy.

2575
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:34,730
Adrian are...

2576
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:36,130
Oh, my God.

2577
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:37,650
I hate you, Till.

2578
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:38,990
I hate you, Till.

2579
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:40,670
What is this?

2580
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:41,930
What is this?

2581
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:43,190
I hate you, Till.

2582
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:48,950
Down with, you, Till.

2583
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:56,610
Cut down, you, Till.

2584
01:43:57,110 --> 01:43:57,670
Yes, indeed.

2585
01:43:58,330 --> 01:43:59,170
Three players out.

2586
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:04,150
And connected on the verge of taking, I believe, five straight if they get this one.

2587
01:44:04,710 --> 01:44:06,690
All I'm saying is...

2588
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:07,210
Oh, my God.

2589
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:07,990
Marshy can...

2590
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:08,510
Oh, my God.

2591
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:09,210
They're choking.

2592
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:10,690
They're actually choking.

2593
01:44:12,670 --> 01:44:15,310
I hate it when I can't see the screen.

2594
01:44:18,090 --> 01:44:18,690
Oh.

2595
01:44:19,090 --> 01:44:20,070
Okay, just...

2596
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:20,570
Wait.

2597
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:21,510
Oh, they're attacking.

2598
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:21,930
Okay.

2599
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:24,490
So, Marshy has to...

2600
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:26,830
Marshy has to...

2601
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:27,010
Oh!

2602
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:31,420
Oh, my God.

2603
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,240
That was a good shot.

2604
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,840
I think...

2605
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,100
Okay.

2606
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:39,180
For overtime, they should just get rid of all names.

2607
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:42,980
Use pure skill.

2608
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,760
It should be, like, pure skill for overtime.

2609
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:49,400
The individual abilities combined with the team abilities.

2610
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:50,600
That's all I'm saying.

2611
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:54,220
Just pure skill.

2612
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:55,000
No util.

2613
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:56,080
Oh!

2614
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:57,880
That wall bang.

2615
01:44:58,620 --> 01:44:59,680
That was a good wall bang.

2616
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:00,440
I don't know.

2617
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,880
The last time we saw gamers were the first kill of the round.

2618
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,280
Yeah, huge first blood from them to be able to snag that.

2619
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,340
That's a good wall bang.

2620
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:07,600
Like, he predicted...

2621
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,840
He predicted that, too.

2622
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:09,500
Which is crazy.

2623
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:11,020
Both teams respecting each other.

2624
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:12,420
For the moment.

2625
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:13,260
Great shots.

2626
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:13,840
Oh!

2627
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:15,860
Chaz gets fouled up by Marshy.

2628
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:16,700
Wait.

2629
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,140
How did they, like, get him...

2630
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:19,180
How did they do that?

2631
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,640
Like, what happened?

2632
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:24,800
Oh, no.

2633
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:26,700
They got the rate bosses down.

2634
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:30,720
That's bad.

2635
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:34,360
They need to kill Marshy because he's, like, four people.

2636
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,540
They killed four people!

2637
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,280
All I'm saying, he's basically four.

2638
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:46,820
Oh, Shifty got...

2639
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:46,960
No.

2640
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,760
Unless Husker can 1v2.

2641
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,480
But it's hard because they have crossfire.

2642
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,300
He has to rush him.

2643
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:57,140
No!

2644
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:58,740
He can't.

2645
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,540
Bro, he couldn't turn in time.

2646
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,680
Oh, another overtime.

2647
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,140
Keep it going.

2648
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:06,720
This is...

2649
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,820
This is rough.

2650
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,120
This is intense.

2651
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:22,620
I think it's because, like, their teammates are now understanding the map as well.

2652
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:24,160
Yeah.

2653
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,060
Huskers needs to up his sense.

2654
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,140
That was, like, low sense debuff right there.

2655
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:30,300
I can't be the same.

2656
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,880
He couldn't turn around in time.

2657
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:34,040
It does feel like they've got a bit more of a reserved game.

2658
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:34,540
You can see it.

2659
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:36,940
Both teams not willing to dive to a...

2660
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:37,220
Oh!

2661
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,260
But Jez and threw the wall shot.

2662
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,320
They had a better new...

2663
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:41,620
How?

2664
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:43,540
That's actually...

2665
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:45,260
That's always crazy to see.

2666
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,320
Wall bangs are scary as hell.

2667
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:48,340
You saw it on Express.

2668
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:49,600
We see it here on...

2669
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:50,900
Check his thumbs!

2670
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,000
Check his thumbs!

2671
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:55,920
Check his thumbs!

2672
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,880
Remove the sleeves!

2673
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:59,300
See what's under there.

2674
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:01,140
...puts gamers into the 4v5.

2675
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:04,380
As they're starting to spread on out.

2676
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:07,120
I think if you are gamers, though, you do just have this ability...

2677
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,180
...where you can kind of just spread the map if you want.

2678
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:09,540
What the...

2679
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,120
What is he?

2680
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:12,500
3v4.

2681
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,200
You see, you have a couple members...

2682
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:15,400
Jez is like...

2683
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:15,720
He's...

2684
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,300
Marci's like, I'm right behind you.

2685
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:18,200
I know you're there.

2686
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,420
I see your running ass right there.

2687
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,640
I see you running.

2688
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:22,160
4.

2689
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:25,420
I mean, he's gotten close to turning this around before.

2690
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,200
We saw him.

2691
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:26,960
Oh, no.

2692
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,360
Oh, it's...

2693
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:28,780
It's...

2694
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,820
Well, just stay...

2695
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:31,280
Stay on point.

2696
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:31,980
Just stay on point.

2697
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:35,280
Is he going to try to play this one aggressively or will he play a bit more reserved?

2698
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,160
He knows he's going to...

2699
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:36,700
Just stay on point.

2700
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:40,060
So, he's going to hustle and have shots fired at him.

2701
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:41,360
Not going to even be concerned...

2702
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,180
I feel like both teams are just really good at Ty.

2703
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:44,980
...try to rotate on him now that they have his position.

2704
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:45,500
Yeah.

2705
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:46,600
He almost had a solid time...

2706
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:46,900
Yeah.

2707
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:48,440
...to kill the player off...

2708
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:49,740
There's too many people alive.

2709
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,000
You know, obviously, if you can manage to make that happen...

2710
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,140
Another overtime.

2711
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:53,720
Jesus.

2712
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:54,840
...scramble a little bit.

2713
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:55,940
There's so much overtime.

2714
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:57,500
...use that to your advantage.

2715
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:58,940
Catch somebody trying to push on in.

2716
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,080
Grab the bomb, but...

2717
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:00,620
Nice.

2718
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:01,700
A little too late.

2719
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:04,040
So, the bomb does get planted and he kind of has to play this way.

2720
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:05,320
Okay, we...

2721
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:06,640
There should be.

2722
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:07,320
I told you.

2723
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:09,660
They should all just get rid of you two during overtime.

2724
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,240
Oh, they're not...

2725
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,040
They're not looking through it anymore.

2726
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:14,060
...that we've seen.

2727
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:15,380
Do you catch Aiden down below here?

2728
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:16,920
I think you get a little bit of...

2729
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,380
Oh, it's too late.

2730
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:19,920
Oh, it's too late.

2731
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,040
He didn't rotate in time.

2732
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,320
Flash onto Jez.

2733
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:24,300
He's actually not going to catch this.

2734
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,620
You got three players down below you, though.

2735
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:26,920
He might get a little bit too aggressive.

2736
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:27,560
He's down.

2737
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:30,660
I think all of them are bad at...

2738
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:35,540
Offense.

2739
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:36,340
We could keep going.

2740
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,000
Feels like we could be here all day.

2741
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:40,000
Both teams continuing to trade back and forth.

2742
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:42,280
Whether first blood or just kills in between.

2743
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:43,660
We've seen trade after trade.

2744
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:45,500
This time, though, a little bit different.

2745
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:47,540
It is gamers who get not only the advantage...

2746
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,620
We might have to go...

2747
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:52,700
Trying to take on the whole team.

2748
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:55,160
Maybe not realizing they're completely on that stairwell.

2749
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:56,880
Oh, he missed.

2750
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:58,280
Wait, Marsh is down, though.

2751
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,340
And this could change everything.

2752
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:01,540
This could change everything.

2753
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:03,140
Oh, wait.

2754
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:03,960
They got the rain.

2755
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:05,080
They got the four players.

2756
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,060
Wait, don't let Jess die.

2757
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:13,740
Don't let him die.

2758
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:14,440
He's your fourth.

2759
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:16,200
He's equal to six players.

2760
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:17,140
He's six players.

2761
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:23,000
Oh, he did it!

2762
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:24,580
Just did it!

2763
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,400
Bro, he's double Marshall's kills.

2764
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:30,900
He's actually double Marshall's kills.

2765
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:31,980
That's crazy.

2766
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:35,320
Bro, bro, don't emote.

2767
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,320
You gotta thank your carry.

2768
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,840
All I'm saying...

2769
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,800
All I'm saying, thank your carry.

2770
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,160
The overconfident emote.

2771
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:56,900
Wait, that's Jess?

2772
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:57,540
Is that Jess?

2773
01:49:57,740 --> 01:49:58,080
Okay, no.

2774
01:49:58,260 --> 01:49:58,940
Wait, that is Jess.

2775
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,060
He has the thumbs.

2776
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,100
Okay, you deserve the emote.

2777
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,720
I saw the thumbs leaves.

2778
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,720
Never mind.

2779
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,040
I thought that other one was Jess.

2780
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,100
Never mind.

2781
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:10,580
Emote as much as you want.

2782
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,460
I have to look for the thumbs leaves.

2783
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:19,160
Player cameras is dapping up everybody.

2784
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:20,200
Giving them high fives.

2785
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:21,560
I couldn't tell.

2786
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:22,760
I forgot what they...

2787
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:25,020
I forgot which one was the captain.

2788
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:27,280
Gotta give some credit to gamers.

2789
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,520
They don't show the cam.

2790
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:30,620
All the way to a map five.

2791
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:33,060
Emo, as much as you want, Jess.

2792
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:34,700
You literally doubled, like...

2793
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:36,380
You doubled Marshy's kills.

2794
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,060
Two rounds back-to-back.

2795
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:43,500
It's gonna be three, two...

2796
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:44,260
In the favor of...

2797
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:47,220
Marshy might be four players, but Jess was, like, ten.

2798
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:48,440
Not going home empty-handed.

2799
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:52,300
$17,500 for them.

2800
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:53,800
They'll get to walk home with...

2801
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:54,740
Yeah, they get 3K.

2802
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:56,300
They get to just watch a magic show.

2803
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:57,500
Getting ready to go up against...

2804
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,560
In Viva Las Vegas.

2805
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:01,680
In the grand finals.

2806
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:04,260
Absolutely insane to see here.

2807
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,960
Definitely, definitely warranted.

2808
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,720
This was beyond deserved to make...

2809
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:11,380
I thought the other guy was Jess.

2810
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:15,060
Because I thought they, like, put the captains at the end of the desk.

2811
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:16,600
Unless he wasn't.

2812
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:17,040
Guys.

2813
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,540
Which one was Jess?

2814
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,900
Was it the guy that had the thumbs-leaves?

2815
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:23,300
Or was it, like, the guy next to him...

2816
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,200
At the end of the table?

2817
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:31,160
I couldn't tell.

2818
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:33,020
Yes.

2819
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,380
Because I thought they would be, like...

2820
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:37,380
At the end of the table.

2821
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,440
Because, uh...

2822
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:39,660
Marshy was at the end of the table.

2823
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:43,060
It's that one.

2824
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:44,120
Here I'd be asking...

2825
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:44,820
Hey, Gemini.

2826
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:47,020
What are some ways to calm myself down?

2827
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,440
It would be funny if, like...

2828
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:50,460
The non-pro is wearing the thumbs-leaves.

2829
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:52,300
Hi.

2830
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:53,120
My name is Jess.

2831
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:54,960
And these are some commo-able tips and tricks.

2832
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:55,940
Oh, there you are.

2833
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:56,820
Go, Jess.

2834
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:57,220
Go.

2835
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,420
Specifically, video settings.

2836
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:01,240
When competing at any level...

2837
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:02,740
Certain settings can be the difference...

2838
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:03,740
Between winning and losing.

2839
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:05,920
Let's take a look at some specific ones...

2840
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:06,960
You should consider using.

2841
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:07,420
Jess tips.

2842
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,260
First off, we'll be taking a look at...

2843
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:09,980
Graphics quality and frame rate.

2844
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:11,360
Take your notes, guys.

2845
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:13,440
You can play just like him.

2846
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:17,480
And by the way, he is playing on...

2847
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:20,240
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

2848
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:26,700
Oh my god.

2849
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,460
Just like the Ultra.

2850
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:29,820
Smooth and quality gaming experience.

2851
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:31,520
Next, we have Explosion Shape.

2852
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:35,660
You want this option off to prevent disorientation and difficulty aiming.

2853
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:38,500
This is something you will not want to experience mid-gunfire.

2854
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:39,580
More FPS means more...

2855
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:40,520
No, that is true.

2856
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,720
More FPS means more gaming.

2857
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:44,360
100% true.

2858
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,700
I agree.

2859
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,520
You are able to change the look of your game from this...

2860
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:55,420
We all saw what happened to me during the rhythm game.

2861
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,660
You guys were like, you're just bad, Doki.

2862
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:59,620
But the moment I played...

2863
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:02,620
With 240 frames...

2864
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:03,800
I beat the game.

2865
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:10,040
It was not the placebo effect.

2866
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:11,040
Did they?

2867
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:13,800
That's wild.

2868
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:17,040
But what about my...

2869
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,620
What about my...

2870
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:19,940
Jest tips?

2871
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:28,280
I can't, guys.

2872
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:30,460
I can't.

2873
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,560
It's part of it.

2874
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:38,720
My jest tips!

2875
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,480
But thank you, Samson.

2876
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:41,340
Wait, that was it?

2877
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,260
From the jest tips?

2878
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:44,580
Oh, I thought there were more jest tips.

2879
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:51,210
I thought there were more jest tips.

2880
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:53,670
I guess that's...

2881
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:55,370
The thing ended...

2882
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:56,450
Very abruptly.

2883
01:53:57,950 --> 01:53:59,530
I didn't realize...

2884
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:01,430
That was all the tips he was gonna give us.

2885
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:03,570
I thought he had more stuff to say.

2886
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:05,130
But I guess that was it.

2887
01:54:06,430 --> 01:54:08,470
He's just that good, guys.

2888
01:54:08,730 --> 01:54:09,810
He's just that good.

2889
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:12,630
If you can't perform like him...

2890
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:13,910
After all those...

2891
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:16,910
Like, direct informational jest tips...

2892
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:17,790
Then it's on you.

2893
01:54:18,270 --> 01:54:19,030
Ha ha ha ha.

2894
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:20,530
Ha ha ha.

2895
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:27,790
All right, we have seven minutes...

2896
01:54:27,790 --> 01:54:29,730
To kill before the next...

2897
01:54:30,450 --> 01:54:31,910
Before you taking a picture of, sir.

2898
01:54:32,110 --> 01:54:33,050
I'm gonna turn this down a little bit.

2899
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:34,070
I'm gonna use the bathroom...

2900
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:34,710
During this break.

2901
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:35,490
I'll be right back, guys.

2902
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:36,390
And I need more water.

2903
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:37,370
I'll be right back.

2904
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:28,770
What happened?

2905
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:30,890
Wait, were they...

2906
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:31,490
Were home...

2907
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:32,610
Were bros being bros?

2908
01:56:33,670 --> 01:56:34,630
What happened?

2909
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:37,130
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2910
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:39,350
What happened?

2911
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:40,270
Nothing.

2912
01:56:41,110 --> 01:56:43,210
Uh, Zookarack, thank you for the tier one sub.

2913
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:44,170
Thank you, thank you.

2914
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:45,870
Just bros being bros.

2915
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:48,110
Our man missed out?

2916
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:55,750
Why is he looking at us?

2917
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:57,210
Because he thinks you're cute, guys.

2918
01:56:58,110 --> 01:56:59,630
Will you help a homie out?

2919
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:03,330
Flushed?

2920
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:11,500
Me?

2921
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,460
Oh, there's so many people there.

2922
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,880
Did you hear about the...

2923
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:30,700
The...

2924
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:31,240
The...

2925
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:32,980
Uh...

2926
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:35,560
Wait, actually, I don't know if I can talk about it.

2927
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:37,160
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2928
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,180
I'll talk about it in another stream.

2929
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:41,860
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2930
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:43,320
Ha ha ha ha!

2931
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:44,680
Ha ha ha ha!

2932
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:48,220
That's right.

2933
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,020
I left you at a cliffhanger.

2934
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,140
What do you...

2935
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:52,320
What does she mean?

2936
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:54,460
Hear about what, Doki?

2937
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:56,180
Find out next time.

2938
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:57,540
On the next stream.

2939
01:57:58,180 --> 01:57:58,620
Ha ha ha ha!

2940
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,460
Ha ha ha ha!

2941
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,260
Ha ha ha!

2942
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,320
Guess we'll never know.

2943
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:07,740
Ha ha ha ha!

2944
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,980
Ha ha ha ha!

2945
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:16,680
What does she mean?

2946
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,660
What does

2947
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:22,420
she mean?

2948
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:24,600
I can talk about the support strike.

2949
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:32,300
Alright, so you know how, like, okay, I find it funny, um, because people are assuming that support players are on a strike right now.

2950
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:39,560
Because they're, like, they're, like, from just one reddit post or whatever.

2951
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:42,480
Um, this is something different, what I wanted to talk about.

2952
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:47,220
No, okay, so, like, apparently, okay, for, this is, like, basically, uh, Marvel Rivals drama.

2953
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:52,340
But there's support players, there's, people are so convinced that support players are on strike.

2954
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:54,440
And I'm, like, uh, no.

2955
01:58:54,620 --> 01:59:01,140
I'm, like, I am pretty sure that it's not an actual strike.

2956
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:04,620
That, like, you know, a lot of players don't go on Reddit.

2957
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:10,080
People just don't want to play.

2958
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:14,540
Like, if a game is not fun, we just don't play the game.

2959
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:18,400
Like, it's not necessarily a strike.

2960
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:21,600
It's just, we just thought it wasn't fun.

2961
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,860
And we can't play as long.

2962
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:30,980
So, people are complaining and basically complaining about, um, dive meta being, like, really difficult.

2963
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:35,860
Which, I agree, like, it is a lot difficult to play in the newest meta.

2964
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:43,460
And I honestly think, I think it's just the, I, I think, like, it's just way too tiring.

2965
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:44,960
So, I don't play as long.

2966
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:55,240
Because, um, I thought, I just think the game is just, took too much of my mental capacity to play for longer, like, longer hours.

2967
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:57,060
So, I log off faster.

2968
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:59,120
And I just don't think it is a strike.

2969
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:02,200
I just think people just don't play as long anymore for support players.

2970
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:03,220
Because it's just not fun.

2971
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:05,640
Like, if the game is fun, then we'll play longer.

2972
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:07,380
But if it's not, then we don't.

2973
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:12,340
Like, also, like, um, also, I would agree.

2974
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,620
No, the rank points is actually so messed up.

2975
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:21,420
Um, I won a game where I was solo support.

2976
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:24,400
I was playing, so, I was solo support.

2977
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:28,020
The enemy team was, was an actual cop.

2978
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:30,960
And I was solo support.

2979
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:34,180
And I got plus 17 points.

2980
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:36,760
After I won the game.

2981
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:41,800
And then my DPS player got plus 27.

2982
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:54,020
I, after I solo, there was, by the way, It was four DPS, one, four DPS, one tank, Mia solo support.

2983
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:59,140
We, and this was a GM3 game, too.

2984
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:03,420
So, GM3 to GM, GM3 to GM1.

2985
02:01:03,620 --> 02:01:06,360
And I still got plus 17.

2986
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:17,840
Because, for those who don't know, The rank point distribution is based off damage.

2987
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:29,380
So, yeah, as the solo support, I wasn't doing enough damage Because I had to heal four DPS.

2988
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:39,260
And I was on, I was on Sue.

2989
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:41,040
Yeah, I can't.

2990
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:46,620
So, like, I can see why it's not fun, too.

2991
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:47,980
Because you're not climbing.

2992
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:52,680
But, like, that, that, I didn't care as much until that game.

2993
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:57,280
Because I was like, what's the point?

2994
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:06,700
Like, I don't get rewarded for playing out of my frickin' mind As the only support player.

2995
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:07,660
Like,

2996
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:13,360
no rank ruins for me.

2997
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:19,540
That, like, actually, that was the one that pissed me off the most.

2998
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:24,040
Um, and people figured out it had to do with damage.

2999
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:34,040
The correlation between damage and Rank points, because They, they're doing a hotfix Patch.

3000
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:50,820
I don't know when they're patching it, but The new patch In the, in the new patch They're doing a hotfix or something In the new balance patch Before the season ends And they're buffing support DPS 20 players So then you know it's correlated.

3001
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:52,620
Because why would they buff support DPS?

3002
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:53,380
Found

3003
02:02:56,860 --> 02:03:04,740

02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:59,080
I feel like we won't hire you, but you can do this for free as a surprise guest.

3034
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:04,520
Tell us a little bit about those first qualifiers, because you were saying you were watching some of those games earlier.

3035
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:06,560
His casters are getting paid.

3036
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,260
Official casters, too.

3037
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,580
First of all, everybody here is better than me.

3038
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:16,620
As soon as anything better than me, I'm already impressed.

3039
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:18,380
I love watching good Call of Duty.

3040
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:20,880
It's such an exciting game to watch.

3041
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,380
You can make plays happen.

3042
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:27,080
I don't know which...

3043
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:32,680
I assume the coach team is the one that got instant eliminated, right?

3044
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:36,680
Commentators!

3045
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:40,880
She's relaxed as hell.

3046
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:47,060
That's the gamer posture right there.

3047
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:49,160
They lose.

3048
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:50,340
They go into overtime.

3049
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:52,000
I mean, they put up a hell of a fight.

3050
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:54,120
But unfortunately, it's just not enough.

3051
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:56,980
But yeah, I mean, it was just kind of like all cylinders firing.

3052
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:00,720
I think what I love for momentum in a couple of those qualifiers is just like...

3053
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:01,020
Jesus.

3054
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:05,200
That looks like cheating.

3055
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:18,860
That looks like cheating.

3056
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,880
I like the 1v1s.

3057
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:32,520
The 1v1s have to be like...

3058
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:33,040
Wait!

3059
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:33,740
It was!

3060
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:35,200
That guy...

3061
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,660
I knew it!

3062
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:39,060
I knew it!

3063
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:39,860
He took off his...

3064
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:41,460
He took off his thumb sleeves!

3065
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:42,660
Bro!

3066
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:44,460
I knew it!

3067
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:45,880
I knew that was chess!

3068
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:48,220
Who's the other guy?

3069
02:08:52,580 --> 02:08:54,180
Who's the other guy?

3070
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:07,620
Who's the other guy?

3071
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:08,140
He took off his thumb sleeves.

3072
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:09,580
I second doubted myself.

3073
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:13,780
I knew that wasn't chess!

3074
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:19,200
But at least he's trying.

3075
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:22,680
You know?

3076
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:25,160
At least he's trying.

3077
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:26,260
At least he's like trying, you know?

3078
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:30,000
He's actually like committed to this.

3079
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:31,740
Like he bought the thumb sleeves.

3080
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:34,880
You can see there, it always went to the game 9.

3081
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:37,280
We will touch it on up and make it.

3082
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:38,100
Okay.

3083
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:39,660
A little bit about this bracket.

3084
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:40,140
Yeah.

3085
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:41,700
A little bit of bracket, okay?

3086
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:44,340
We saw Nebula Knights there in our first game.

3087
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:45,040
3-0.

3088
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:45,980
Notorious.

3089
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:47,040
It wasn't even close.

3090
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:48,640
Absolutely cooked it.

3091
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:49,120
You know?

3092
02:09:49,180 --> 02:09:50,040
They've been on ice.

3093
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:50,780
They've been waiting.

3094
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:51,940
They haven't even been able to play.

3095
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:52,920
Oh!

3096
02:09:53,420 --> 02:09:53,900
Second time.

3097
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:55,080
Game 5.

3098
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:55,640
Momentum.

3099
02:09:56,260 --> 02:09:56,940
I'm looking up.

3100
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,200
I want to know like...

3101
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:59,500
It's another best of 5.

3102
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:01,120
I just want to know.

3103
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:02,360
Like...

3104
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:02,720
What are we...

3105
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:03,040
What's...

3106
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:04,600
Who's on whose team?

3107
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:06,180
That's all I want to know.

3108
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:08,640
I think Nebula Knights is going to come in like cocky.

3109
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:09,520
They just got 3-0.

3110
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:11,560
But Momentum had to fight for their win.

3111
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:13,160
So they're like all cylinders...

3112
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:14,840
Okay, Momentum is more warmed up.

3113
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:17,760
I feel like Momentum as a team is much more warmed up.

3114
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:18,120
3-0?

3115
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:18,680
Momentum?

3116
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:19,560
I say...

3117
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:20,880
I say 3-1 Momentum.

3118
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:21,840
3-1 Momentum.

3119
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:24,220
I lowkey agree with that take, Dylan.

3120
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:26,140
I'm going to look at the previous 5.

3121
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:28,720
Now granted, I didn't get a chance to see Nebula Knights play too much.

3122
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:29,740
I saw here and there.

3123
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:31,300
But I watched a good amount of that last game.

3124
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:32,080
So...

3125
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:33,460
I'm pretty confident.

3126
02:10:33,460 --> 02:10:35,560
If they can play like that against gamers, like...

3127
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:36,340
They should have it in the bag.

3128
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:36,920
Plus like...

3129
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,280
It's like when you beat a team too early.

3130
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:40,200
And now you got an extra, extra long break.

3131
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:40,660
Oh yeah.

3132
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:42,860
And sometimes your fingers are a little cold.

3133
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:44,000
You know...

3134
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:44,740
Oh yeah.

3135
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:45,220
This...

3136
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:47,860
Guys, the coach's team was the one that got 3-0.

3137
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:51,760
Guys.

3138
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:53,540
The coach's team was the one.

3139
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:55,480
They got that...

3140
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:56,940
Yeah, they got knocked that instantly.

3141
02:10:58,020 --> 02:10:58,540
Okay.

3142
02:10:58,840 --> 02:10:59,700
This team...

3143
02:10:59,700 --> 02:11:00,460
I'm looking at it.

3144
02:11:00,540 --> 02:11:02,500
Nebula Knights is Space's team.

3145
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:06,980
So this is Space and this is Jez.

3146
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,200
I knew it!

3147
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:11,520
That was Jez!

3148
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:12,840
I see their pictures now!

3149
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:14,320
It has their pictures!

3150
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:16,040
I knew it!

3151
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:20,320
Guys...

3152
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:21,740
Or a...

3153
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:23,860
Vibe check was the strat, guys.

3154
02:11:25,380 --> 02:11:27,360
It was all about the vibes.

3155
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:29,180
Yeah, no.

3156
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:31,400
The pros were definitely very important.

3157
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:32,340
They like...

3158
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:34,700
They put the entire team on their backs.

3159
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:52,340
But like, I feel like, okay, but Marsha's team, they had the better team...

3160
02:11:52,340 --> 02:12:00,580
They had the better, like, overall team players versus Jez, but it was him.

3161
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:04,320
I thought this... we all were debating if this was Jez or not.

3162
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:05,800
It was this guy.

3163
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:06,320
Wait!

3164
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:10,180
Wait a minute!

3165
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:12,900
I'm not gonna say it.

3166
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:14,840
I remember the kill score.

3167
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:21,440
I remember the team score.

3168
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:23,120
I'm not gonna say it.

3169
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:25,300
He was killing them all the call-outs for Express.

3170
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:28,460
He was letting them know exactly what it was, like, what we're calling these.

3171
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:30,220
He knows exactly how to play these maps.

3172
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:31,340
I think Raiden's a good shout.

3173
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:32,440
Yeah, I agree.

3174
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,040
I think Raiden is there.

3175
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:35,200
I want to give some credit, though.

3176
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:36,700
I feel like...

3177
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:38,700
I feel like...

3178
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:41,120
Huskers is really good, though.

3179
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:42,540
Huskers is really good.

3180
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:46,280
I mean, he was a Call of Duty pro in general, so it transfers over.

3181
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:49,900
I don't really know, like, the other players here.

3182
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:51,880
I know Huskers is good.

3183
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:54,120
He can be able to kind of cook there, so...

3184
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:54,200
For sure.

3185
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:54,720
For sure.

3186
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,820
Very, very excited as we get ready.

3187
02:12:56,920 --> 02:12:59,400
I mean, he was their second fragger, too.

3188
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:01,140
Who's your projected MVP?

3189
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:02,520
Okay, if I'm going...

3190
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:04,160
Okay, I'm not picking a Call of Duty mobile pro.

3191
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:05,320
I feel like that's...

3192
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:06,080
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

3193
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:07,100
I feel like it's too.

3194
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:08,980
It's like, oh, the guy who's played this forever.

3195
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:10,440
Yeah, he's probably gonna do the best on the map.

3196
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:11,300
Wait, who is it?

3197
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:12,800
I don't know who it is.

3198
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:13,580
I don't know, man.

3199
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:15,060
I think I'm gonna go with Aiden.

3200
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:18,280
I think he did a really good job.

3201
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:19,480
He turned up in that...

3202
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:22,180
Like, I'm like, I don't know who it is.

3203
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:24,080
Who's been around longer?

3204
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:26,060
He's kind of, like, playing his life really well.

3205
02:13:26,220 --> 02:13:28,980
You have to explain this from someone who doesn't know.

3206
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:33,100
Great stuff as we get ready to move on into the grand finals.

3207
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:35,060
Now, grand finals is not the only thing that we're doing.

3208
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:35,860
Show match.

3209
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:36,880
Don't make me Google.

3210
02:13:38,020 --> 02:13:39,480
I'm not gonna lie, I'm most excited for that.

3211
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:40,480
You're most excited for that?

3212
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:41,240
I love 1-1.

3213
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:43,260
Mike Wazowski.

3214
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:46,880
He didn't tell us who it is.

3215
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:48,160
Cover him up.

3216
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:54,640
He didn't tell me.

3217
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:56,760
Put the PNG up.

3218
02:13:57,620 --> 02:13:58,940
All right, well, guess what?

3219
02:13:59,020 --> 02:14:00,020
Our teams are ready to go.

3220
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:01,400
Grand finals, ready to get started.

3221
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:04,400
We're gonna kick it over to Bass to help introduce our teams.

3222
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:05,040
Yeah.

3223
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:08,700
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

3224
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:10,140
We have our...

3225
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:13,000
Wait, they removed it after it's done.

3226
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:13,700
That's funny.

3227
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:16,620
There's no other than Momentum.

3228
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:22,560
Jez, Aiden, Huskers, Santana, and Noemi.

3229
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:23,240
Woo!

3230
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:32,860
Let's go.

3231
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,980
In your booth you go.

3232
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:40,400
In the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra booth.

3233
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:48,620
Jez, Huskers, and Friends.

3234
02:14:51,620 --> 02:14:52,360
Jez, Huskers, and Friends.

3235
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:52,540
Okay, look.

3236
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:54,840
It's Jez, Huskers, and Friends.

3237
02:15:00,990 --> 02:15:01,850
All right.

3238
02:15:02,110 --> 02:15:04,130
And for our second team.

3239
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:06,410
The Nebula Knights.

3240
02:15:06,410 --> 02:15:12,610
Space, Lucky, Isaac, Rated, and Primrose.

3241
02:15:13,070 --> 02:15:20,110
Bum, bum, bum, ba-dum, bum, ba-dum, bum, bum, ba-dum, bum, ba-dum, bum, bum, bum.

3242
02:15:20,410 --> 02:15:22,590
That is like some boss music right there.

3243
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:26,650
Into the next booth you go.

3244
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:34,050
Bum, bum, bum, ba-dum, bum, ba-dum, bum, ba-dum, bum, ba-dum, bum, bum.

3245
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:37,270
All right.

3246
02:15:37,470 --> 02:15:39,470
Let's get ready for our grand finals.

3247
02:15:39,670 --> 02:15:41,530
Casters, one last time.

3248
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:42,450
Take it away.

3249
02:15:43,810 --> 02:15:44,290
Wow.

3250
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:47,690
What a good job that man Bastos yelling about our teams.

3251
02:15:47,870 --> 02:15:48,730
Jumping on in.

3252
02:15:48,890 --> 02:15:49,310
Hey, listen.

3253
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:51,330
He had to kind of do that last minute.

3254
02:15:51,470 --> 02:15:54,270
So I'm glad he was able to clutch it on up.

3255
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:55,150
All right.

3256
02:15:55,450 --> 02:15:56,130
Game number one.

3257
02:15:56,350 --> 02:15:58,650
We're getting ready to hop on in.

3258
02:15:58,770 --> 02:15:59,550
I actually don't know, production.

3259
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:01,790
We can pull up the maps of what we are playing.

3260
02:16:01,850 --> 02:16:02,230
Wait.

3261
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:03,190
Guys.

3262
02:16:04,330 --> 02:16:07,190
Apparently, Marshy was like...

3263
02:16:07,190 --> 02:16:07,850
Wait.

3264
02:16:07,890 --> 02:16:09,590
Actually, I'm looking at winnings.

3265
02:16:10,250 --> 02:16:10,890
All right.

3266
02:16:11,090 --> 02:16:12,650
I'm looking at winnings, but...

3267
02:16:16,930 --> 02:16:22,190
Marshy has the most winnings out of like...

3268
02:16:22,190 --> 02:16:24,510
All the players.

3269
02:16:24,970 --> 02:16:26,350
But he still lost to Jez.

3270
02:16:26,650 --> 02:16:27,250
So...

3271
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:31,710
I think Jez is the one that's been around the longest.

3272
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:34,030
Because it says he's played...

3273
02:16:34,710 --> 02:16:35,310
29...

3274
02:16:35,310 --> 02:16:38,050
I'm actually looking this up because I got really curious.

3275
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:39,010
I was like...

3276
02:16:39,010 --> 02:16:40,770
I was like...

3277
02:16:40,770 --> 02:16:44,150
Who is like the most well-known pro in this tournament?

3278
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:46,610
Where the heck is space?

3279
02:16:47,470 --> 02:16:48,950
Does he go by a different name?

3280
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:51,830
I'm hoping we at least go four.

3281
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:52,770
That's why I'm really like...

3282
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:53,110
Me too.

3283
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:53,210
Me too.

3284
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:53,490
Me too.

3285
02:16:53,510 --> 02:16:54,310
You know what's funny?

3286
02:16:55,270 --> 02:16:57,450
Jez is the one that doesn't put his age out.

3287
02:16:59,370 --> 02:17:00,430
I'm looking at the...

3288
02:17:00,430 --> 02:17:02,430
I'm looking at the esports...

3289
02:17:02,430 --> 02:17:02,620
And...

3290
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:04,250
And like...

3291
02:17:04,250 --> 02:17:06,050
It shows everybody's age.

3292
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:07,070
Oh, I guess like...

3293
02:17:07,070 --> 02:17:08,910
Tectonic doesn't have his age out either.

3294
02:17:09,110 --> 02:17:10,610
I don't know where...

3295
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:12,330
I don't know how Tectonic is.

3296
02:17:12,330 --> 02:17:14,730
One, firing range, search and destroy.

3297
02:17:15,290 --> 02:17:16,670
And if we get to those last two maps...

3298
02:17:16,670 --> 02:17:17,590
Hacienda Harpo...

3299
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:18,890
But Jez doesn't have his age.

3300
02:17:19,790 --> 02:17:20,230
Coincidence?

3301
02:17:20,510 --> 02:17:21,290
I think not.

3302
02:17:22,530 --> 02:17:23,230
Where's space?

3303
02:17:25,150 --> 02:17:27,570
Call of Duty, mobile pros, space.

3304
02:17:28,190 --> 02:17:29,250
I'm also kind of curious how...

3305
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:30,290
Firing range...

3306
02:17:30,290 --> 02:17:31,230
Oh, he has a Liquipedia.

3307
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:32,950
I mean, that's like...

3308
02:17:32,950 --> 02:17:33,930
That is a throwback.

3309
02:17:34,130 --> 02:17:35,630
It's still saying Black Ops 2...

3310
02:17:35,630 --> 02:17:35,870
Right, right.

3311
02:17:36,710 --> 02:17:37,690
Oh, wait.

3312
02:17:37,790 --> 02:17:39,730
Did he transition to...

3313
02:17:39,730 --> 02:17:40,150
Oh, wait.

3314
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:40,350
No.

3315
02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:43,750
Oh, he's retired.

3316
02:17:44,570 --> 02:17:45,990
Okay, we know who's going to win then.

3317
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:50,390
Guys.

3318
02:17:51,890 --> 02:17:55,450
It seems like space is the retired player.

3319
02:17:55,650 --> 02:17:57,790
And Jez is still competing.

3320
02:18:01,210 --> 02:18:03,230
Alright, this might be...

3321
02:18:03,230 --> 02:18:05,590
Alright, let's do a...

3322
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:06,890
Let's do a prediction, guys.

3323
02:18:10,230 --> 02:18:13,690
I think this is the perfect time for a prediction, now.

3324
02:18:14,570 --> 02:18:16,210
I already do a prediction, I don't remember.

3325
02:18:19,950 --> 02:18:20,430
Slash...

3326
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:21,390
Prediction.

3327
02:18:21,790 --> 02:18:22,230
I mean, it is.

3328
02:18:22,330 --> 02:18:23,030
Is this kind of like a nice...

3329
02:18:23,030 --> 02:18:23,630
Alright.

3330
02:18:23,730 --> 02:18:24,730
Start prediction.

3331
02:18:26,610 --> 02:18:27,090
Jez.

3332
02:18:27,770 --> 02:18:30,730
The non-retired pro...

3333
02:18:30,730 --> 02:18:31,910
Versus space.

3334
02:18:32,270 --> 02:18:32,870
You can't be...

3335
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:33,770
Who is retiring.

3336
02:18:34,170 --> 02:18:34,550
Oh, wait.

3337
02:18:36,730 --> 02:18:38,090
Sometimes you just got to, though.

3338
02:18:38,330 --> 02:18:39,230
Sometimes it works.

3339
02:18:39,430 --> 02:18:40,410
Sometimes you get benched.

3340
02:18:40,630 --> 02:18:42,030
Do you like your odds?

3341
02:18:42,450 --> 02:18:43,590
Unfortunately, uh...

3342
02:18:43,590 --> 02:18:44,670
You just kind of have to suck here.

3343
02:18:44,750 --> 02:18:45,850
You can't get benched.

3344
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:47,650
You're just bottom frag for your team.

3345
02:18:47,990 --> 02:18:48,010
Yeah.

3346
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:49,250
Your squad's looking at you.

3347
02:18:49,610 --> 02:18:50,670
It's costing us $10,000.

3348
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:53,470
Here goes all my points.

3349
02:18:53,650 --> 02:18:54,850
You don't want to be the one to call it that.

3350
02:18:54,850 --> 02:18:55,790
No, it doesn't.

3351
02:18:55,810 --> 02:18:58,630
I'm going to put my entire savings.

3352
02:18:59,670 --> 02:19:02,670
Because it's kind of insane when we talk about the bracket, man.

3353
02:19:03,030 --> 02:19:03,770
Hey, look.

3354
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:04,290
Look.

3355
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:07,670
Maybe I'm just saying that so I can...

3356
02:19:08,470 --> 02:19:10,170
I vote for space.

3357
02:19:10,490 --> 02:19:11,930
Maybe I lied.

3358
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:16,690
Just so I can win the bet.

3359
02:19:18,450 --> 02:19:21,070
Just so I can yoink all your points.

3360
02:19:21,090 --> 02:19:23,350
I could have just lied about that.

3361
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:25,270
How would you know?

3362
02:19:26,730 --> 02:19:28,590
You're not going to Google it yourself?

3363
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:33,790
Sounds like turkey.

3364
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:35,930
I love that.

3365
02:19:36,070 --> 02:19:38,350
And then obviously, after our bracket, we got that show match.

3366
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:39,690
Dylan's excited for it.

3367
02:19:39,690 --> 02:19:39,870
Oh, wow.

3368
02:19:40,030 --> 02:19:40,830
10 for the show match.

3369
02:19:41,090 --> 02:19:41,450
10 for the show.

3370
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:43,710
So it's kind of crazy because like Bass was talking about it.

3371
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:45,330
Already making it here.

3372
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:49,270
The captain is already secured at least $4,000.

3373
02:19:49,270 --> 02:19:50,090
I was like curious.

3374
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:50,830
I was like, wait.

3375
02:19:51,790 --> 02:19:53,250
Okay, let me look up.

3376
02:19:53,350 --> 02:19:53,910
20 grand.

3377
02:19:53,950 --> 02:19:55,070
I'm saying at least by getting here.

3378
02:19:55,130 --> 02:19:56,250
But then you go into the show match.

3379
02:19:56,550 --> 02:19:56,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3380
02:19:56,770 --> 02:19:57,910
And you're taking over at least another five.

3381
02:19:58,410 --> 02:20:00,650
So if you're one of these captains, you've secured at least nine grand.

3382
02:20:01,190 --> 02:20:02,230
Wait, how old is it?

3383
02:20:02,290 --> 02:20:04,570
Which sometimes is not so good for your hunger and overall...

3384
02:20:06,210 --> 02:20:06,870
I think...

3385
02:20:06,870 --> 02:20:07,310
I think...

3386
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:08,210
I think...

3387
02:20:08,210 --> 02:20:08,230
I think...

3388
02:20:08,230 --> 02:20:08,270
I think...

3389
02:20:08,890 --> 02:20:09,430
All right.

3390
02:20:09,910 --> 02:20:14,290
All those who actually looked up their Liquipedia will know why I laughed.

3391
02:20:15,970 --> 02:20:19,610
I looked up both Space and Jez's Liquipedia.

3392
02:20:22,470 --> 02:20:25,490
Now I know why Jez is really, really good.

3393
02:20:25,490 --> 02:20:28,210
Now I know why.

3394
02:20:31,390 --> 02:20:33,110
Now I realize why.

3395
02:20:33,310 --> 02:20:35,910
I want to talk to the players here, man.

3396
02:20:36,410 --> 02:20:38,050
Players, there's a lot of money on the line.

3397
02:20:38,210 --> 02:20:39,530
This is no joke.

3398
02:20:39,790 --> 02:20:40,310
You don't want to be...

3399
02:20:40,310 --> 02:20:41,150
I don't want to let your team down.

3400
02:20:41,310 --> 02:20:42,130
You're all gamers.

3401
02:20:42,610 --> 02:20:44,110
Just some of you are better gamers.

3402
02:20:44,510 --> 02:20:46,190
Goodbye, my point.

3403
02:20:47,070 --> 02:20:47,790
Tell us.

3404
02:20:48,050 --> 02:20:50,710
I'll tell you guys after the prediction's over.

3405
02:20:51,990 --> 02:20:52,970
Oh, it's over.

3406
02:20:53,330 --> 02:20:55,510
I'll tell you after this game is over.

3407
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:56,350
Banging it out.

3408
02:20:57,730 --> 02:20:58,570
Oh, unless...

3409
02:20:58,570 --> 02:20:59,230
I mean...

3410
02:20:59,230 --> 02:21:00,770
We're kind of worried with this team.

3411
02:21:00,770 --> 02:21:01,450
Wait, wait.

3412
02:21:01,850 --> 02:21:02,150
A little bit.

3413
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:03,010
Are they going to come out swinging?

3414
02:21:03,010 --> 02:21:03,410
Wait.

3415
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:04,490
Oh, never mind.

3416
02:21:04,870 --> 02:21:05,750
Just got him down.

3417
02:21:06,690 --> 02:21:07,770
Oh, wait.

3418
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:09,850
He's going to have to...

3419
02:21:09,850 --> 02:21:11,190
Not just lead in terms of kills.

3420
02:21:11,310 --> 02:21:13,750
He's going to have to lead in terms of communication as well.

3421
02:21:15,530 --> 02:21:15,970
All right.

3422
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:16,710
Let's see him.

3423
02:21:16,930 --> 02:21:19,050
The thing I'm always looking to do is like the spawns.

3424
02:21:19,050 --> 02:21:19,630
Oh, my God.

3425
02:21:19,770 --> 02:21:19,910
What?

3426
02:21:20,710 --> 02:21:22,910
Goddamn, like, anchor dropped on them.

3427
02:21:23,150 --> 02:21:24,350
They're kind of spawning deep, right?

3428
02:21:24,690 --> 02:21:25,690
Just come on.

3429
02:21:25,810 --> 02:21:26,810
I need the points.

3430
02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:29,750
Great job of being able to kind of hopefully get in on this hill.

3431
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:31,490
It's a couple early points, though.

3432
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:33,530
Yeah, it goes hard points.

3433
02:21:34,110 --> 02:21:34,510
1v1.

3434
02:21:35,010 --> 02:21:36,310
And then, um...

3435
02:21:36,310 --> 02:21:37,370
What is Lucky doing?

3436
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:40,590
What is that strat?

3437
02:21:40,590 --> 02:21:41,190
Yeah, this is definitely a tough one.

3438
02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:43,630
You're trying to have to sacrifice yourself for the betterment of the team.

3439
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:44,410
I'm not doing it.

3440
02:21:44,410 --> 02:21:45,270
I'm an objective player.

3441
02:21:45,530 --> 02:21:46,910
So, like, I'm happy to got to leave my life.

3442
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:47,850
What was that?

3443
02:21:48,190 --> 02:21:48,770
I'm not that player.

3444
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:49,250
You slayer?

3445
02:21:49,370 --> 02:21:49,990
I'm an islet.

3446
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:52,130
I'll just take that ball and I'll clean up after you.

3447
02:21:52,230 --> 02:21:53,070
I'll always clean up, though.

3448
02:21:53,810 --> 02:21:54,190
You got it, dude.

3449
02:21:54,490 --> 02:21:55,070
Yeah, you got me, though.

3450
02:21:55,070 --> 02:21:56,090
Go, Jez, go.

3451
02:21:56,390 --> 02:21:57,450
That's some good teamwork.

3452
02:21:57,650 --> 02:21:58,110
That's what you want.

3453
02:21:58,310 --> 02:21:58,570
Exactly.

3454
02:21:58,810 --> 02:21:59,690
You need the OBJ guy.

3455
02:21:59,690 --> 02:22:01,630
Okay, who has a point right now, though?

3456
02:22:01,630 --> 02:22:04,510
Okay, it's Jez's team.

3457
02:22:07,710 --> 02:22:08,350
Alright.

3458
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:11,130
So, I'll tell you why.

3459
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:18,070
If Space's team wins this, they honestly are...

3460
02:22:18,070 --> 02:22:18,970
What is going...

3461
02:22:18,970 --> 02:22:19,830
Wait, did he got locked?

3462
02:22:19,970 --> 02:22:20,830
Did he got util-ed?

3463
02:22:20,830 --> 02:22:33,710
Okay, the reason why I think if Space's team wins this, then, like, um, overall team might be better.

3464
02:22:34,450 --> 02:22:39,710
Because, and, like, he might have just, like, locked in, like, because he knows it's, like, 30 grand.

3465
02:22:40,070 --> 02:22:41,770
He might have locked in really, really hard.

3466
02:22:41,770 --> 02:22:53,310
But the reason why I was, like, oh, my God, is because I looked at Space has made total winnings so far.

3467
02:22:54,530 --> 02:22:57,270
Um, yeah, he's, like, the underdog right now.

3468
02:22:58,870 --> 02:23:04,370
Is that he has made 27k in total winnings.

3469
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:07,710
Now, if we look at Jez...

3470
02:23:10,070 --> 02:23:17,110
Now, let me pull up Jez on the other hand, who is not retired yet.

3471
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:22,990
He may or may not have won $146,000.

3472
02:23:26,050 --> 02:23:26,970
Oh!

3473
02:23:33,730 --> 02:23:42,730
So, I was, like, if Space does this, like, he deserves, like, he is truly the underdog right now.

3474
02:23:42,930 --> 02:23:43,750
Do it again!

3475
02:23:44,130 --> 02:23:44,610
Dude, he's still gone.

3476
02:23:44,790 --> 02:23:44,990
One more, what else?

3477
02:23:44,990 --> 02:23:50,270
The rest of his face, my boys, right from the start.

3478
02:23:50,930 --> 02:23:54,170
I mean, look, it's pretty close, guys.

3479
02:23:55,450 --> 02:23:58,750
Space might just have the better team, in general.

3480
02:24:01,510 --> 02:24:04,490
But, like, the 1v1 is where we're gonna see it.

3481
02:24:05,810 --> 02:24:09,150
The 1v1 is where we're gonna see the true, true game thing.

3482
02:24:09,190 --> 02:24:10,890
He plays on what's called six-finger claw.

3483
02:24:11,350 --> 02:24:16,050
So, he literally uses, like, his, I don't know, his middle finger, his index, and his thumb.

3484
02:24:16,050 --> 02:24:17,010
Well, that's the point right now.

3485
02:24:17,070 --> 02:24:17,490
I can't tell.

3486
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:18,970
Okay, it's Space's team.

3487
02:24:19,610 --> 02:24:21,030
It is pretty close, guys.

3488
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:23,030
Guys, it is pretty close.

3489
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:24,910
They're going, that are doing something.

3490
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:26,870
They might, he might do it.

3491
02:24:26,970 --> 02:24:29,130
I mean, there's really not, I mean, I'm trying to watch this.

3492
02:24:29,310 --> 02:24:32,070
I've never been happy in the midst of both.

3493
02:24:32,830 --> 02:24:33,450
The midst of both.

3494
02:24:33,450 --> 02:24:34,010
They're doing a good job.

3495
02:24:34,130 --> 02:24:37,110
They brought it back to roughly a 50-point game, which isn't true.

3496
02:24:37,330 --> 02:24:40,590
Yeah, I'm just trying to give you false hope right now.

3497
02:24:40,990 --> 02:24:42,950
I'm into it, but I think the Knights are just...

3498
02:24:42,950 --> 02:24:45,210
What is, what is, what is I didn't doing?

3499
02:24:45,850 --> 02:24:48,590
I, it's just like, yeah, bye.

3500
02:24:50,030 --> 02:24:51,050
This is a cold game.

3501
02:24:51,050 --> 02:24:55,550
I was like, don't worry, Jess got this.

3502
02:24:56,670 --> 02:25:00,690
Oh my god, bro, she just burned him alive.

3503
02:25:01,350 --> 02:25:03,810
She was like, you're, no movement for you.

3504
02:25:04,070 --> 02:25:12,130
I liked how, I liked how, um, Space's team was like, I, screw movement.

3505
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:13,210
Screw your movement.

3506
02:25:13,210 --> 02:25:14,670
I'm just gonna burn you.

3507
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:17,550
If you're ready to head on over to this next hill.

3508
02:25:17,570 --> 02:25:23,090
No, the coach, no, every other pro, other than the coach's team, based it off of vibes.

3509
02:25:23,710 --> 02:25:25,830
Um, the coach's team got eliminated instantly.

3510
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:28,870
Yes, back to the middle, and I won't die, man.

3511
02:25:28,910 --> 02:25:29,650
They got flag jacket.

3512
02:25:30,370 --> 02:25:31,690
Uh, some of them do, yeah.

3513
02:25:31,690 --> 02:25:33,050
The coach's team got 3-0.

3514
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:35,150
I googled.

3515
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:35,910
I googled.

3516
02:25:35,910 --> 02:25:36,230
Not googled.

3517
02:25:36,310 --> 02:25:37,250
I looked at the vibe.

3518
02:25:39,350 --> 02:25:52,530
Because, like, because, like, this team, like, a lot of it is, like, heavy, uh, the coach couldn't, uh, obviously, is not, like, at the same skill level as, like, the pros, because, you know, he's a coach.

3519
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:56,110
So, like, a lot of, like, depends on, like, kills as well.

3520
02:25:56,330 --> 02:25:56,870
I was just gonna, like, some of those...

3521
02:25:56,870 --> 02:26:00,370
Hills are, like, any time you get on this P1, it's just braving, right?

3522
02:26:00,570 --> 02:26:02,010
Like, you're, like, alright, cool, like...

3523
02:26:02,010 --> 02:26:03,370
Guys, it's okay, guys.

3524
02:26:04,010 --> 02:26:05,850
Space still has the 1v1.

3525
02:26:06,330 --> 02:26:08,010
It's gonna be all about, like, the move over to...

3526
02:26:08,010 --> 02:26:09,990
I love, I love that anchor gun.

3527
02:26:10,110 --> 02:26:10,750
That's so funny.

3528
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:11,670
Yeah, they was able to break the hill, though.

3529
02:26:11,670 --> 02:26:12,850
It just, like, throws an anchor.

3530
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:14,170
Like, uh...

3531
02:26:14,170 --> 02:26:16,230
Yeah, in the end, they all get money in the end, which is good.

3532
02:26:16,770 --> 02:26:19,730
But, like, you were mentioning, they don't have that much practice together.

3533
02:26:19,950 --> 02:26:21,570
So, even if they're individually fantastic...

3534
02:26:21,570 --> 02:26:21,890
Wait, who?

3535
02:26:22,590 --> 02:26:24,970
If together, they don't have much experience, sometimes...

3536
02:26:24,970 --> 02:26:25,570
Space's team?

3537
02:26:25,810 --> 02:26:26,430
Like, hardpoint...

3538
02:26:26,430 --> 02:26:28,630
Uh, on a mode like hardpoint, you need that chemistry.

3539
02:26:28,850 --> 02:26:31,610
To be fair, I also think Jez's team is gonna win.

3540
02:26:31,890 --> 02:26:34,990
Because they played longer together during the final...

3541
02:26:34,990 --> 02:26:35,810
Like, the...

3542
02:26:35,810 --> 02:26:36,570
During the...

3543
02:26:37,270 --> 02:26:37,670
Three...

3544
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:39,850
During, like, you know, they went to overtime and everything.

3545
02:26:40,130 --> 02:26:41,870
So, their team has longer time to bond.

3546
02:26:46,750 --> 02:26:47,150
Jeez.

3547
02:26:49,090 --> 02:26:50,270
Yeah, and they just played...

3548
02:26:50,270 --> 02:26:50,850
Oh, wait, that's true.

3549
02:26:50,930 --> 02:26:51,510
They just played.

3550
02:26:51,510 --> 02:26:52,190
And then...

3551
02:26:52,190 --> 02:26:53,630
Space has to warm up.

3552
02:26:53,810 --> 02:26:55,130
And then, Space just killed everybody.

3553
02:26:56,790 --> 02:26:58,790
Space and Raided just killed everybody.

3554
02:27:01,070 --> 02:27:03,190
Yeah, I think...

3555
02:27:03,190 --> 02:27:04,910
They have better teamwork, for sure.

3556
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:05,630
I feel.

3557
02:27:06,570 --> 02:27:07,050
I think...

3558
02:27:08,870 --> 02:27:10,830
Raided is better than Huskers.

3559
02:27:10,830 --> 02:27:11,070
Yeah.

3560
02:27:11,150 --> 02:27:12,070
At the moment.

3561
02:27:13,710 --> 02:27:14,230
At this point...

3562
02:27:14,230 --> 02:27:15,030
Just cause like...

3563
02:27:15,030 --> 02:27:15,470
Kill...

3564
02:27:15,470 --> 02:27:16,670
Like, fragging wise...

3565
02:27:16,670 --> 02:27:17,370
He has...

3566
02:27:17,370 --> 02:27:19,310
His second fragger is better.

3567
02:27:19,590 --> 02:27:21,350
They're kinda showing some signs of life here.

3568
02:27:21,470 --> 02:27:23,270
They've brought it back into a 60 point game.

3569
02:27:24,910 --> 02:27:25,970
What's going on?

3570
02:27:26,150 --> 02:27:27,090
Oh, what the hell?

3571
02:27:27,450 --> 02:27:27,930
Oh!

3572
02:27:28,370 --> 02:27:28,490
What?

3573
02:27:28,910 --> 02:27:29,890
Panicked right there.

3574
02:27:30,070 --> 02:27:30,630
Wide open.

3575
02:27:31,730 --> 02:27:32,310
Oh God.

3576
02:27:32,310 --> 02:27:32,950
Oh, new point.

3577
02:27:34,050 --> 02:27:37,690
That's the one thing, is that like, obviously, your thumbs can slip.

3578
02:27:38,290 --> 02:27:38,770
Yeah!

3579
02:27:39,330 --> 02:27:40,290
Yeah, they can!

3580
02:27:40,610 --> 02:27:41,930
Get those thumbs sleeves, guys!

3581
02:27:43,510 --> 02:27:45,590
Exclamation point, Samson!

3582
02:27:47,410 --> 02:27:47,890
Yeah!

3583
02:27:50,710 --> 02:27:51,530
Thumbs sleeves!

3584
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:55,690
Oh!

3585
02:27:58,750 --> 02:28:00,010
Bro, they just walked in!

3586
02:28:00,210 --> 02:28:01,210
That's so fast!

3587
02:28:01,750 --> 02:28:02,930
What, they're just dead?!

3588
02:28:02,930 --> 02:28:03,430
Already?!

3589
02:28:03,430 --> 02:28:04,790
That was so fast!

3590
02:28:05,390 --> 02:28:07,010
That actually happened so fast!

3591
02:28:07,170 --> 02:28:07,870
Oh, he got the gloves!

3592
02:28:09,410 --> 02:28:10,750
He got the gloves!

3593
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:13,190
I noticed not a lot of people are meleeing at all.

3594
02:28:13,630 --> 02:28:14,530
I like this though, Husker.

3595
02:28:14,790 --> 02:28:15,770
Gets us some good shots.

3596
02:28:15,890 --> 02:28:17,350
Teammates able to help follow it on up.

3597
02:28:17,690 --> 02:28:18,850
Oh, they got the point back!

3598
02:28:18,990 --> 02:28:19,130
Nice!

3599
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:21,650
Oh, my God!

3600
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:24,050
Space is... Space is just nailing everybody!

3601
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:25,430
Jess, where are you?

3602
02:28:25,570 --> 02:28:26,070
Save him!

3603
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:30,390
I'm squeezing out all this time.

3604
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:32,410
I found them, seeing if you can rotate in time.

3605
02:28:33,090 --> 02:28:34,030
He's catching up.

3606
02:28:34,130 --> 02:28:34,650
Oh, never mind.

3607
02:28:34,690 --> 02:28:35,350
He lost a point.

3608
02:28:35,550 --> 02:28:36,590
They're right back in there.

3609
02:28:36,930 --> 02:28:36,930
Oh!

3610
02:28:38,330 --> 02:28:39,350
We bust down.

3611
02:28:40,210 --> 02:28:42,490
Bring it back to... Wait, is that a new point?

3612
02:28:42,910 --> 02:28:43,390
For them.

3613
02:28:43,450 --> 02:28:44,550
They were down a lot.

3614
02:28:44,610 --> 02:28:45,190
Oh, wait!

3615
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:46,290
They got back!

3616
02:28:46,770 --> 02:28:49,370
Iceman Isaac will get takedown by a predator drone.

3617
02:28:50,030 --> 02:28:50,190
Yup.

3618
02:28:50,410 --> 02:28:52,630
Probably not exactly what you want to see, but...

3619
02:28:52,630 --> 02:28:54,610
Let's see if Nebula can break it here.

3620
02:28:54,750 --> 02:28:57,030
This is gonna be a pretty deciding factor.

3621
02:28:57,250 --> 02:28:58,730
That would've been crazy if you got that off.

3622
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:03,750
I love, like, the grenade launcher there.

3623
02:29:06,230 --> 02:29:07,470
I need to see the cam in there.

3624
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:07,870
Here we go.

3625
02:29:08,010 --> 02:29:08,390
Here we go.

3626
02:29:08,490 --> 02:29:08,730
Okay.

3627
02:29:08,970 --> 02:29:09,670
That gotta be the better.

3628
02:29:09,850 --> 02:29:12,290
The akimbo pistol is slaying.

3629
02:29:12,610 --> 02:29:14,310
The dual pistol seems so strong.

3630
02:29:14,590 --> 02:29:15,630
There's zero recoil.

3631
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:17,790
Wait, is there zero recoil?

3632
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:20,170
He's holding down fire and moving close.

3633
02:29:20,170 --> 02:29:21,230
That's so strong.

3634
02:29:21,490 --> 02:29:22,930
Is it, like, points to get it?

3635
02:29:22,930 --> 02:29:23,870
In his close quarters.

3636
02:29:25,210 --> 02:29:25,870
Oh, my!

3637
02:29:26,950 --> 02:29:28,470
Did he drone himself?

3638
02:29:28,890 --> 02:29:29,810
You love to see it.

3639
02:29:30,050 --> 02:29:32,190
On the inside, at least you get the two before you take it on out.

3640
02:29:32,190 --> 02:29:33,190
What did he do?

3641
02:29:34,210 --> 02:29:35,250
What was that?

3642
02:29:36,910 --> 02:29:41,550
I guess I broke it, but it looks like momentum's gonna early rotate to the next hill.

3643
02:29:41,910 --> 02:29:43,110
Smart when you're up this much.

3644
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:46,470
Yeah, momentum's doing a good job of maintaining.

3645
02:29:46,730 --> 02:29:47,830
Oh, killstreak.

3646
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:49,850
...hold on the lead here.

3647
02:29:50,030 --> 02:29:50,890
It goes up to 250?

3648
02:29:51,070 --> 02:29:52,210
Yeah, it goes to 250, man.

3649
02:29:52,210 --> 02:29:52,350
It's definitely 250.

3650
02:29:53,150 --> 02:29:54,690
They can't possibly choke this.

3651
02:29:55,510 --> 02:29:58,170
Sorry, sometimes I say stuff like that just to see if...

3652
02:29:58,170 --> 02:30:00,510
I didn't even know they say it commentator is there.

3653
02:30:00,750 --> 02:30:00,990
I don't know.

3654
02:30:01,430 --> 02:30:03,170
There's no way they'll choke this.

3655
02:30:03,370 --> 02:30:04,910
Like, you hope that they lose it now?

3656
02:30:05,090 --> 02:30:07,110
And you say, there's no way they choke this, right?

3657
02:30:08,350 --> 02:30:10,550
There's definitely a way they can choke it.

3658
02:30:10,650 --> 02:30:12,710
Oh, yeah, there always is a way, especially in hardpoint.

3659
02:30:14,410 --> 02:30:20,790
I'm like, okay, so, like, we were watching Jez's team for so long, that, like, I keep thinking yellow is him.

3660
02:30:20,790 --> 02:30:24,610
So, it's like, it, like, throws me off to find him as blue now.

3661
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:28,470
Where, you know, your physical athleticism plays a huge role.

3662
02:30:28,970 --> 02:30:32,370
Like, you could be the greatest at aiming, but when you're on stage...

3663
02:30:32,370 --> 02:30:33,670
He's just like, where did he come from?

3664
02:30:34,110 --> 02:30:34,930
You could crumble.

3665
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:36,670
That could, that could be the reality.

3666
02:30:36,850 --> 02:30:37,070
And sometimes...

3667
02:30:37,070 --> 02:30:39,210
Jesus, oh my god, this is the anchor.

3668
02:30:39,570 --> 02:30:41,350
The anchor is such a cool gun.

3669
02:30:41,470 --> 02:30:43,450
I love, I love the kill animation for that.

3670
02:30:43,790 --> 02:30:46,110
The kill animation for the anchor is so funny.

3671
02:30:46,990 --> 02:30:48,910
Oh, the nade.

3672
02:30:49,590 --> 02:30:50,710
Hold on.

3673
02:30:53,620 --> 02:30:58,520
Might have spoke too soon, as Nebula Knight seems to be climbing back in this one.

3674
02:30:58,760 --> 02:31:00,500
Down about 20 points here.

3675
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:01,660
Wait, oh, it's close.

3676
02:31:01,860 --> 02:31:02,860
It's actually really close.

3677
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:04,180
This one's gonna be super important.

3678
02:31:04,580 --> 02:31:06,600
Yeah, look, Raiden has 36 kills.

3679
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:08,320
I just think...

3680
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:13,100
Oh my god, look at the 90 to 62.

3681
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:15,360
Jez is like...

3682
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:16,700
Wait, no Emmy, no Emmy, no Emmy!

3683
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:17,920
Noooo!

3684
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,080
That's huge, that's a huge break!

3685
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:22,680
That might be the game, that might be the game, that might be the game.

3686
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:23,140
Is that it?

3687
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:24,440
Oh, unless...

3688
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:24,720
Look at this!

3689
02:31:24,860 --> 02:31:25,360
Keep him alive!

3690
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:27,000
Oh!

3691
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:29,620
It's so much!

3692
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:30,680
I see a Kimbo!

3693
02:31:32,380 --> 02:31:34,740
Jez absolutely cleared the point here before getting killed.

3694
02:31:35,060 --> 02:31:36,720
Keep him alive, guys!

3695
02:31:37,180 --> 02:31:37,940
You have to keep...

3696
02:31:37,940 --> 02:31:38,140
Oh!

3697
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:39,200
Difference.

3698
02:31:39,580 --> 02:31:40,300
They've not made it at all.

3699
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:42,640
Oh no, oh no, they're catching up, they're catching up!

3700
02:31:42,920 --> 02:31:43,920
Scrap time, which is sick.

3701
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:45,980
Wait, even if with the scrap time, you'll even...

3702
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:46,900
They're catching up!

3703
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:49,260
Wait, space might actually hold, hold!

3704
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:50,200
Yeah, if I'm...

3705
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:51,720
Space might actually hold this!

3706
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:54,060
Squeeze out the scrap time, I'm trying to...

3707
02:31:54,060 --> 02:31:56,040
Oh, it's close, it's too...

3708
02:31:56,040 --> 02:31:57,480
Oh, wait, they...

3709
02:31:57,480 --> 02:31:58,980
They overtake it!

3710
02:31:59,040 --> 02:31:59,860
And they took the lead!

3711
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:01,880
They actually took the lead!

3712
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:03,300
No way!

3713
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,140
Let's see if they can find a way...

3714
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:10,860
Guys, by the way, the prediction is per round, guys.

3715
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:11,780
I'm gonna win this one right here.

3716
02:32:13,820 --> 02:32:14,200
No!

3717
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:16,540
Space's not my point!

3718
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:24,460
What if I lied about the winnings the entire time?

3719
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:25,620
What if...

3720
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:27,980
What if I lied about it, guys?

3721
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:29,380
No!

3722
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:30,200
No!

3723
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:33,440
226!

3724
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:38,060
It's per round, guys!

3725
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:40,340
You should have read the fine print!

3726
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:41,880
He's insane!

3727
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:43,900
He's insane!

3728
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:44,200
Oh!

3729
02:32:45,100 --> 02:32:57,260
39, 40, 42, 43, 46, 47, 48!

3730
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:01,630
You know you ain't won!

3731
02:33:02,390 --> 02:33:03,570
Look at the pop-off!

3732
02:33:03,570 --> 02:33:05,850
What if I lied about it, guys?

3733
02:33:05,850 --> 02:33:08,170
We got scammed!

3734
02:33:08,350 --> 02:33:08,950
I'm taking care of you!

3735
02:33:09,170 --> 02:33:09,890
I'm taking care of you!

3736
02:33:09,890 --> 02:33:12,050
My, my, buddy!

3737
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:13,670
No!

3738
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:14,430
They hurt you!

3739
02:33:14,590 --> 02:33:16,010
Yeah, that's what I want to say!

3740
02:33:16,570 --> 02:33:17,990
Always believed!

3741
02:33:19,630 --> 02:33:22,810
Always spit on the underdog, baby!

3742
02:33:26,730 --> 02:33:27,450
Oh!

3743
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:29,350
Yes!

3744
02:33:29,790 --> 02:33:31,510
Always go against the odds!

3745
02:33:31,510 --> 02:33:34,350
All right!

3746
02:33:36,230 --> 02:33:38,270
Looks like space one!

3747
02:33:38,530 --> 02:33:40,650
Yummy, yummy, money, money!

3748
02:33:41,350 --> 02:33:41,870
Wow!

3749
02:33:45,730 --> 02:33:47,990
More kills did not equal!

3750
02:33:48,770 --> 02:33:51,030
I really need a new phone scene, because my keys are...

3751
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:55,330
Is there anything to say about the Samsung S25 Ultra before I go pick it up?

3752
02:33:55,330 --> 02:33:55,790
Oh!

3753
02:33:56,110 --> 02:33:57,730
That thank you for the segway!

3754
02:33:57,950 --> 02:33:58,630
But yeah!

3755
02:33:59,030 --> 02:34:06,130
Um, it does have a large va- larger vapor chamber and upgraded cooling system, so it does help with the...

3756
02:34:06,130 --> 02:34:07,710
Also not overheat and stuff.

3757
02:34:07,970 --> 02:34:08,530
So yeah!

3758
02:34:08,750 --> 02:34:09,270
Thank you!

3759
02:34:09,490 --> 02:34:10,530
Thank you for the bitties!

3760
02:34:10,790 --> 02:34:11,030
I'm ready!

3761
02:34:11,350 --> 02:34:11,490
Thank you!

3762
02:34:11,630 --> 02:34:11,730
Thank you!

3763
02:34:16,170 --> 02:34:17,210
Thank you!

3764
02:34:17,210 --> 02:34:18,230
That's the person below me!

3765
02:34:18,690 --> 02:34:19,010
Below you!

3766
02:34:19,350 --> 02:34:19,490
Yay!

3767
02:34:19,890 --> 02:34:20,670
35k!

3768
02:34:25,910 --> 02:34:26,730
Yippee!

3769
02:34:28,350 --> 02:34:31,710
Thanks for donating your quads, guys!

3770
02:34:31,710 --> 02:34:32,570
I thought about like...

3771
02:34:32,570 --> 02:34:33,370
Ha ha ha!

3772
02:34:35,630 --> 02:34:36,090
753k!

3773
02:34:36,710 --> 02:34:37,170
Damn!

3774
02:34:37,450 --> 02:34:39,090
Always bet on the underdogs!

3775
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:41,250
But I think I was dealing with saying like...

3776
02:34:41,250 --> 02:34:41,530
All right!

3777
02:34:41,650 --> 02:34:42,050
Here we go!

3778
02:34:42,110 --> 02:34:43,030
Let's start a new prediction!

3779
02:34:43,510 --> 02:34:43,810
Tell me like...

3780
02:34:43,810 --> 02:34:44,710
You see...

3781
02:34:44,710 --> 02:34:45,510
How they're playing!

3782
02:34:45,770 --> 02:34:46,210
And it's like...

3783
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:46,370
All right!

3784
02:34:46,530 --> 02:34:46,790
Let's adjust!

3785
02:34:47,150 --> 02:34:47,410
So...

3786
02:34:47,410 --> 02:34:47,610
For what...

3787
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:48,430
First thing we noticed...

3788
02:34:48,430 --> 02:34:49,270
Space!

3789
02:34:50,430 --> 02:34:51,350
The underdog!

3790
02:34:52,290 --> 02:34:52,650
I'm now...

3791
02:34:52,650 --> 02:34:53,310
I'm not...

3792
02:34:54,050 --> 02:34:54,510
Myself...

3793
02:34:54,510 --> 02:34:55,450
Especially on a hardpoint...

3794
02:34:55,450 --> 02:34:55,990
Start prediction!

3795
02:34:56,630 --> 02:34:56,810
All right!

3796
02:34:56,810 --> 02:34:58,230
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick!

3797
02:34:58,550 --> 02:34:58,770
It was...

3798
02:34:58,770 --> 02:34:59,170
Are you back?

3799
02:34:59,730 --> 02:35:01,890
I think we were a little bit surprised...

3800
02:35:01,890 --> 02:35:02,690
To see some of the...

3801
02:35:02,690 --> 02:35:04,330
The stuff coming on out there...

3802
02:35:04,330 --> 02:35:04,650
Because yeah!

3803
02:35:04,770 --> 02:35:05,850
I don't think any of us were...

3804
02:35:05,850 --> 02:35:06,670
Literally ready for...

3805
02:35:06,670 --> 02:35:08,430
Akimbo Pistols to...

3806
02:35:08,430 --> 02:35:09,570
Apparently be the best gun...

3807
02:35:09,570 --> 02:35:09,590
Yeah!

3808
02:35:09,590 --> 02:35:10,470
You put those in my hands...

3809
02:35:10,470 --> 02:35:10,790
I might...

3810
02:35:10,790 --> 02:35:11,810
I might get a killer to myself!

3811
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:13,010
I knew the room was cleared...

3812
02:35:13,010 --> 02:35:14,370
Whenever I see the Akimbo Pistols come out!

3813
02:35:14,710 --> 02:35:15,490
Ha ha ha ha!

3814
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:16,110
If...

3815
02:35:16,110 --> 02:35:16,290
If...

3816
02:35:16,290 --> 02:35:19,050
Space has that laser...

3817
02:35:19,050 --> 02:35:19,730
That point is held!

3818
02:35:20,030 --> 02:35:21,250
That point is held or taken!

3819
02:35:21,450 --> 02:35:21,570
The...

3820
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:22,890
The Tempest is like...

3821
02:35:23,110 --> 02:35:23,430
Because like...

3822
02:35:23,430 --> 02:35:24,230
People forget like...

3823
02:35:24,230 --> 02:35:24,830
That thing like...

3824
02:35:24,830 --> 02:35:25,890
Comes out in Black Ops 4!

3825
02:35:25,990 --> 02:35:26,850
And it's just like...

3826
02:35:26,850 --> 02:35:28,470
Basically a lightning rifle...

3827
02:35:28,470 --> 02:35:29,750
That if it hits anybody...

3828
02:35:29,750 --> 02:35:30,550
It's going to stun them!

3829
02:35:30,670 --> 02:35:30,730
Right?

3830
02:35:30,830 --> 02:35:31,910
And if you manage to get a headshot...

3831
02:35:31,910 --> 02:35:32,890
Like you're getting kills with it too!

3832
02:35:33,190 --> 02:35:33,230
Yeah!

3833
02:35:33,610 --> 02:35:34,150
It's crazy!

3834
02:35:34,370 --> 02:35:34,550
Like...

3835
02:35:34,550 --> 02:35:34,930
So it's like...

3836
02:35:34,930 --> 02:35:36,330
With all those confined spaces...

3837
02:35:36,330 --> 02:35:37,950
When he's able to let that thing fly...

3838
02:35:37,950 --> 02:35:38,670
He's going to be able to...

3839
02:35:38,670 --> 02:35:40,190
To absolutely bring people down!

3840
02:35:40,290 --> 02:35:41,250
But map number one man...

3841
02:35:41,250 --> 02:35:41,350
Yeah!

3842
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:42,110
I kind of...

3843
02:35:42,110 --> 02:35:43,050
Someone call it an upset!

3844
02:35:43,350 --> 02:35:44,730
Someone call it an upset!

3845
02:35:45,070 --> 02:35:46,110
I'm pretty good for this through one!

3846
02:35:46,450 --> 02:35:46,670
Some people...

3847
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:47,750
Some people to my left name agent...

3848
02:35:47,750 --> 02:35:48,630
Might call that an upset!

3849
02:35:48,830 --> 02:35:49,030
You know?

3850
02:35:49,150 --> 02:35:49,350
Like...

3851
02:35:49,350 --> 02:35:49,930
Who knows?

3852
02:35:50,690 --> 02:35:51,070
That's there!

3853
02:35:51,150 --> 02:35:51,410
I think...

3854
02:35:51,410 --> 02:35:52,510
I think we need to ban you...

3855
02:35:52,510 --> 02:35:53,490
From making any more provisions!

3856
02:35:54,010 --> 02:35:54,690
But look though!

3857
02:35:54,870 --> 02:35:55,730
That made for a great game!

3858
02:35:55,890 --> 02:35:56,650
I think game one...

3859
02:35:56,650 --> 02:35:57,750
Game one of the finals...

3860
02:35:57,750 --> 02:35:58,610
It was cinematic!

3861
02:35:58,910 --> 02:35:59,250
You feel me?

3862
02:35:59,590 --> 02:36:00,510
Down 100 points!

3863
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:01,410
Clawing their way back!

3864
02:36:01,510 --> 02:36:02,830
E point by point by point!

3865
02:36:03,190 --> 02:36:04,450
And then clutching it out at the very end!

3866
02:36:04,630 --> 02:36:06,030
So we can get more games like that!

3867
02:36:06,370 --> 02:36:07,630
We might just go to a game five!

3868
02:36:08,070 --> 02:36:08,630
I'd love it!

3869
02:36:08,790 --> 02:36:08,890
Yeah!

3870
02:36:09,050 --> 02:36:09,270
I mean...

3871
02:36:09,270 --> 02:36:10,450
We're here in great finals!

3872
02:36:10,570 --> 02:36:11,070
Might as well, right?

3873
02:36:11,110 --> 02:36:11,310
Yeah!

3874
02:36:11,630 --> 02:36:11,990
Hell yeah!

3875
02:36:12,470 --> 02:36:12,810
All right!

3876
02:36:13,030 --> 02:36:13,730
Map number two though!

3877
02:36:13,850 --> 02:36:14,550
We gotta talk about it!

3878
02:36:14,570 --> 02:36:15,410
This is the 1v1 baby!

3879
02:36:15,690 --> 02:36:15,850
Yeah!

3880
02:36:15,950 --> 02:36:16,730
This is the 1v1!

3881
02:36:16,830 --> 02:36:17,750
Now this is all mental!

3882
02:36:18,070 --> 02:36:18,390
Realistically!

3883
02:36:18,690 --> 02:36:19,310
All mental!

3884
02:36:19,810 --> 02:36:20,910
Well this is what I was like telling Bass!

3885
02:36:20,910 --> 02:36:25,230
I'm like, if you go down like five kills to your opponent man, like that early on, your mental's checked!

3886
02:36:25,250 --> 02:36:25,990
They can break in!

3887
02:36:26,030 --> 02:36:26,370
Yeah!

3888
02:36:26,390 --> 02:36:27,030
Your mental's checked!

3889
02:36:27,810 --> 02:36:28,050
Yeah!

3890
02:36:28,050 --> 02:36:33,410
You gotta have like insane just grit to be able to like come back on in and be able to like bring that lead back in your favor!

3891
02:36:33,970 --> 02:36:37,470
But you know, we got two very talented players being able to kind of load on in!

3892
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:38,570
We got Space and Jez!

3893
02:36:38,710 --> 02:36:38,910
Yeah!

3894
02:36:38,950 --> 02:36:40,510
We're now about to go out in that 1v1!

3895
02:36:40,670 --> 02:36:48,550
And I'm most excited for this because I feel like, you know, we saw earlier where the two Call of Duty Mobile Pros kind of battled it out super close all the way through!

3896
02:36:48,710 --> 02:36:50,570
I think we're gonna be the same here!

3897
02:36:50,910 --> 02:36:51,390
Right, right!

3898
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:54,870
Tell us a little bit more about their experience, uh, both Jez and Space!

3899
02:36:55,290 --> 02:36:55,350
Yeah!

3900
02:36:55,650 --> 02:37:02,170
So, so Space, uh, he was a, a, uh, he went on a 30 tournament win streak in Call of Duty Mobile!

3901
02:37:02,330 --> 02:37:03,090
It was crazy!

3902
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:05,070
He also won Call of Duty Mobile World Champs!

3903
02:37:05,070 --> 02:37:07,430
And in 2022, uh, Jez...

3904
02:37:07,430 --> 02:37:09,110
That's the Wayne Gretzky of Call of Duty Mobile!

3905
02:37:10,330 --> 02:37:11,730
Believe it, Jez!

3906
02:37:12,330 --> 02:37:14,570
Jez, he's able to, uh, win Call of Duty Mobile Champs!

3907
02:37:14,770 --> 02:37:15,190
He actually did it!

3908
02:37:15,430 --> 02:37:15,870
He actually did it!

3909
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:17,470
Oh, man!

3910
02:37:19,510 --> 02:37:21,430
Welcome back guys!

3911
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:22,210
So what?

3912
02:37:23,070 --> 02:37:23,630
Come on in!

3913
02:37:23,630 --> 02:37:24,710
Always go all in!

3914
02:37:26,090 --> 02:37:27,050
After what?

3915
02:37:27,370 --> 02:37:29,050
Oh, it's sniper time!

3916
02:37:29,050 --> 02:37:31,290
Wait, they're not even using shotguns!

3917
02:37:31,970 --> 02:37:33,590
I think I'm taking space for this one!

3918
02:37:33,770 --> 02:37:34,350
Yeah, me too!

3919
02:37:34,530 --> 02:37:34,730
I know!

3920
02:37:34,730 --> 02:37:36,550
I know you got, I can't bet against it!

3921
02:37:36,570 --> 02:37:36,690
All right!

3922
02:37:38,770 --> 02:37:40,670
The sniper does make a lot of sense on this map!

3923
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:42,050
Should be a lot of head glitching!

3924
02:37:44,550 --> 02:37:45,270
3-0!

3925
02:37:46,250 --> 02:37:48,050
Yeah, you can do, listen, that's the cool part of the level!

3926
02:37:48,110 --> 02:37:48,990
You can do whatever you want!

3927
02:37:49,470 --> 02:37:50,210
We allow all the guns!

3928
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:53,550
I think, I think it's cool that they're using snipers instead of shotguns this time!

3929
02:37:54,370 --> 02:37:55,310
So we can get...

3930
02:37:55,310 --> 02:37:56,210
I miss this map so much!

3931
02:37:58,790 --> 02:38:00,550
Okay, I think we know who's the better player!

3932
02:38:00,610 --> 02:38:04,750
I think, I think we know mechanically who's better!

3933
02:38:06,150 --> 02:38:06,550
I...

3934
02:38:08,350 --> 02:38:15,090
Just from, just from the shots alone, from both of them!

3935
02:38:15,250 --> 02:38:16,510
Oh, that was a good wallbang though!

3936
02:38:17,030 --> 02:38:17,750
That was good!

3937
02:38:21,930 --> 02:38:25,990
I think mechanically, mechanically, Jez is definitely better!

3938
02:38:26,210 --> 02:38:26,550
Space?

3939
02:38:27,610 --> 02:38:29,970
Space, you gotta kinda get some of these...

3940
02:38:29,970 --> 02:38:31,730
Oh, I think Jez!

3941
02:38:32,130 --> 02:38:35,630
Okay, you know what, I think Jez is being like super cocky!

3942
02:38:35,810 --> 02:38:41,870
And he's using the same, he's like, utilizing the same guns that Space is using!

3943
02:38:42,450 --> 02:38:44,830
He's, he's playing very cocky right now!

3944
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:47,710
Because he was on sniper!

3945
02:38:48,470 --> 02:38:50,930
He's trying to ego, I feel like he's egoing him!

3946
02:38:52,250 --> 02:38:57,510
Yeah, because he was like on sniper first, and then he's like, You know what, you're using that gun, I'm gonna use that gun too!

3947
02:38:57,730 --> 02:38:58,810
I'm gonna have to fight a war after a 1v1, so...

3948
02:38:59,610 --> 02:39:03,050
Especially, just losing that last one, I think momentum...

3949
02:39:03,050 --> 02:39:04,830
Jez, stop egoing him!

3950
02:39:06,730 --> 02:39:08,830
Hey guys, Space is catching up!

3951
02:39:08,830 --> 02:39:11,410
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

3952
02:39:11,410 --> 02:39:13,310
Search and destroy, you're down O2...

3953
02:39:13,310 --> 02:39:16,030
All the Jez supporters are now being like, NO!

3954
02:39:16,030 --> 02:39:16,910
S&D's next?

3955
02:39:17,070 --> 02:39:17,750
S&D's next?

3956
02:39:18,190 --> 02:39:18,370
Fire!

3957
02:39:19,050 --> 02:39:21,250
Why did I not vote for Space?

3958
02:39:24,330 --> 02:39:26,050
All right, Space, you've been able to...

3959
02:39:26,050 --> 02:39:27,310
See look, it's 30,000 on the line.

3960
02:39:27,510 --> 02:39:27,590
Yeah.

3961
02:39:27,870 --> 02:39:28,950
I'm sitting in the back hardscoping.

3962
02:39:29,290 --> 02:39:33,130
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

3963
02:39:33,710 --> 02:39:36,790
But for 30 bands, I will be sitting in the back hardscoping with my thermal.

3964
02:39:37,370 --> 02:39:38,190
You can't stop me.

3965
02:39:38,190 --> 02:39:39,750
Hey, listen, you gotta do what you gotta do man.

3966
02:39:39,910 --> 02:39:40,490
You can't stop me.

3967
02:39:40,490 --> 02:39:41,490
Money's on the mine.

3968
02:39:43,790 --> 02:39:44,950
You do whatever you can.

3969
02:39:45,090 --> 02:39:48,330
I'm surprised people haven't swapped over to Space yet.

3970
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:50,030
So committed to this Type 63.

3971
02:39:50,730 --> 02:39:53,450
He used it at our crap show during that free fall.

3972
02:39:53,930 --> 02:39:55,470
Gerald, you didn't even vote.

3973
02:39:55,810 --> 02:39:58,250
You're not even part of the predictions.

3974
02:39:58,970 --> 02:40:00,270
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

3975
02:40:00,270 --> 02:40:00,750
Cooking with it.

3976
02:40:01,390 --> 02:40:02,910
And he said it was one of his favorite guns.

3977
02:40:03,050 --> 02:40:03,150
Oh, yo.

3978
02:40:03,210 --> 02:40:04,110
Jez, what?

3979
02:40:04,370 --> 02:40:05,150
The ego!

3980
02:40:05,790 --> 02:40:08,030
Bro, he's egoing so hard.

3981
02:40:11,570 --> 02:40:13,850
I think Jez definitely has an ego there.

3982
02:40:13,870 --> 02:40:15,290
I've seen him land some of these.

3983
02:40:15,290 --> 02:40:16,470
Like, oh my god.

3984
02:40:16,750 --> 02:40:18,090
The aim assist on mobile has to be.

3985
02:40:18,670 --> 02:40:19,070
Yeah, I think he just...

3986
02:40:19,070 --> 02:40:19,510
There's like none.

3987
02:40:19,910 --> 02:40:20,790
He just tied it up, too.

3988
02:40:20,790 --> 02:40:21,090
There's like none.

3989
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:23,530
Because I asked, I was the first...

3990
02:40:23,530 --> 02:40:24,950
I gave him my points.

3991
02:40:25,270 --> 02:40:26,610
You must be like, used to the aim assist, right?

3992
02:40:26,790 --> 02:40:27,870
And they're like, nah, there's like none.

3993
02:40:28,170 --> 02:40:29,110
I was like, oh my gosh.

3994
02:40:29,810 --> 02:40:31,170
Ah, I'm 10 times more.

3995
02:40:31,370 --> 02:40:33,050
Jez, what am I watching now?

3996
02:40:35,210 --> 02:40:35,910
Look at this.

3997
02:40:36,170 --> 02:40:36,850
Spam aiming.

3998
02:40:37,490 --> 02:40:39,610
Somebody asked, how does a 1v1 work in a team?

3999
02:40:39,850 --> 02:40:41,370
Well, they're representing their teams here.

4000
02:40:41,810 --> 02:40:46,170
So, whichever one of the team captains wins this one is going to take the second game.

4001
02:40:46,830 --> 02:40:47,610
Don't worry.

4002
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:48,830
I'll vote for SpaceX.

4003
02:40:50,970 --> 02:40:52,190
Fool me once.

4004
02:40:52,610 --> 02:40:53,730
Shame on you.

4005
02:40:54,190 --> 02:40:55,550
Fool me twice.

4006
02:41:01,690 --> 02:41:06,130
I think if Jez continues, if Jez used the sniper, they would win this.

4007
02:41:06,390 --> 02:41:06,710
Honestly.

4008
02:41:07,510 --> 02:41:14,530
I honestly feel like Jez using the other gun is too much of an ego.

4009
02:41:16,810 --> 02:41:18,670
I think his sniper is better.

4010
02:41:18,890 --> 02:41:19,370
I think his sniper is better.

4011
02:41:19,810 --> 02:41:22,350
If you shoot me from behind, are you really better than me?

4012
02:41:23,050 --> 02:41:24,170
Like, if you shot me from behind, are you right?

4013
02:41:24,170 --> 02:41:26,790
Legit, he got six points with Jez sniper, so I don't understand.

4014
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:27,570
You can't go up there.

4015
02:41:27,570 --> 02:41:27,950
Yeah, see?

4016
02:41:29,630 --> 02:41:31,710
That's how you judged skill back in the day, man.

4017
02:41:32,470 --> 02:41:33,070
That's how we judged.

4018
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:37,670
Jez just needs to literally just use sniper and he wins this.

4019
02:41:37,670 --> 02:41:40,930
Definitely, like, slowed down, I feel like, for both these guys.

4020
02:41:41,110 --> 02:41:41,870
Okay, never mind.

4021
02:41:42,010 --> 02:41:42,430
That's fine.

4022
02:41:43,970 --> 02:41:46,670
First, like, ten kills on the board, five and five.

4023
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:48,110
Jez, please, I just, Jez.

4024
02:41:48,470 --> 02:41:49,770
Oh, he's whiffing.

4025
02:41:50,090 --> 02:41:50,730
He's crashed.

4026
02:41:50,970 --> 02:41:51,690
He's whiffing.

4027
02:41:51,810 --> 02:41:52,770
He's crashing out.

4028
02:41:52,890 --> 02:41:53,430
Never mind.

4029
02:41:56,690 --> 02:41:57,090
Okay.

4030
02:41:57,890 --> 02:41:58,550
Never mind.

4031
02:41:58,850 --> 02:41:59,510
Caster's curse.

4032
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:00,430
Now he whiffs.

4033
02:42:03,150 --> 02:42:04,170
Oh, is it cut up?

4034
02:42:04,270 --> 02:42:05,390
Oh, you guys don't see the score.

4035
02:42:05,950 --> 02:42:07,710
Yeah, it is cut off a little bit.

4036
02:42:07,810 --> 02:42:08,430
Don't worry, I'll tell you.

4037
02:42:08,650 --> 02:42:10,250
It's 11 to seven right now.

4038
02:42:10,470 --> 02:42:11,270
You need to keep Jez to run this.

4039
02:42:12,030 --> 02:42:12,870
Because Jez is momentum.

4040
02:42:13,190 --> 02:42:13,710
Oh, I'm stripping.

4041
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:14,290
Yeah, you're right.

4042
02:42:15,990 --> 02:42:17,150
It's 11 to seven.

4043
02:42:17,450 --> 02:42:19,350
It's 12 to seven now.

4044
02:42:20,190 --> 02:42:21,390
Jez is kind of cooking right now.

4045
02:42:21,530 --> 02:42:23,090
Oh, yeah, they're scoring the top left, too.

4046
02:42:23,270 --> 02:42:24,510
Yeah, yeah, there's a score over there.

4047
02:42:25,250 --> 02:42:26,150
You guys don't need to see that.

4048
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:27,370
You can see the score on top left.

4049
02:42:32,510 --> 02:42:33,810
Oh, he's like, where is he?

4050
02:42:34,270 --> 02:42:34,610
Where is he?

4051
02:42:36,370 --> 02:42:36,730
Okay.

4052
02:42:37,810 --> 02:42:39,710
Oh, he's locking in now, guys.

4053
02:42:40,110 --> 02:42:40,530
They're pretty good.

4054
02:42:41,430 --> 02:42:43,050
He's no longer egoing.

4055
02:42:43,250 --> 02:42:45,370
You'll see that happens a lot exactly like that.

4056
02:42:45,690 --> 02:42:46,550
Never mind.

4057
02:42:47,790 --> 02:42:50,650
The giant anchor that falls from the sky.

4058
02:42:50,650 --> 02:42:53,250
Not trying to make any sort of sound.

4059
02:42:54,670 --> 02:42:55,310
Caster's curse.

4060
02:42:57,370 --> 02:42:57,850
Oh!

4061
02:42:58,550 --> 02:42:58,910
Oh!

4062
02:43:00,130 --> 02:43:00,330
Oh!

4063
02:43:00,350 --> 02:43:01,910
I want to see that from the other angle.

4064
02:43:02,110 --> 02:43:03,450
Oh, I want the replay.

4065
02:43:04,070 --> 02:43:05,630
That movement was so good.

4066
02:43:06,030 --> 02:43:07,030
That's such a good movement.

4067
02:43:09,570 --> 02:43:11,290
That movement was insane there.

4068
02:43:11,470 --> 02:43:13,430
We've seen that happen a couple times.

4069
02:43:13,890 --> 02:43:18,370
in these 1v1s where someone's able just to hit some sort of jump over somebody else.

4070
02:43:18,530 --> 02:43:19,050
And it is just...

4071
02:43:19,050 --> 02:43:19,370
Oh!

4072
02:43:19,830 --> 02:43:20,450
Oh, I got it.

4073
02:43:20,810 --> 02:43:21,550
Normal kill.

4074
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:22,370
Not cool.

4075
02:43:25,370 --> 02:43:26,070
It's very close.

4076
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:26,350
Yeah.

4077
02:43:30,770 --> 02:43:31,190
Oh!

4078
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:32,250
Oh!

4079
02:43:32,450 --> 02:43:33,710
That flick was insane.

4080
02:43:33,990 --> 02:43:34,390
Oh my god.

4081
02:43:34,590 --> 02:43:34,930
I want to see...

4082
02:43:34,930 --> 02:43:36,350
I want to see the replay!

4083
02:43:37,290 --> 02:43:38,450
You beat the replay!

4084
02:43:40,090 --> 02:43:40,990
The fact that...

4085
02:43:40,990 --> 02:43:43,990
Yeah, this is all on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

4086
02:43:44,190 --> 02:43:44,810
Oh, he's feeling it.

4087
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:46,670
No!

4088
02:43:47,130 --> 02:43:48,150
He's closing the lead.

4089
02:43:48,390 --> 02:43:49,090
Only down two.

4090
02:43:50,690 --> 02:43:52,430
He's just playing too cocky again.

4091
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:55,330
Oh, baby.

4092
02:43:55,390 --> 02:43:55,970
A tripper!

4093
02:44:00,370 --> 02:44:01,790
That was a...

4094
02:44:01,790 --> 02:44:03,590
Yeah, that was an insane flick.

4095
02:44:03,710 --> 02:44:04,630
Oh my god.

4096
02:44:05,230 --> 02:44:06,310
Oh my god.

4097
02:44:06,410 --> 02:44:08,330
Wait, and then he got a nade kill there?

4098
02:44:08,450 --> 02:44:10,190
Uh, it might be a hunter killer drone.

4099
02:44:10,310 --> 02:44:11,050
It was, yeah.

4100
02:44:13,650 --> 02:44:14,490
It's all good.

4101
02:44:14,770 --> 02:44:15,710
I mean, yeah, that guy was playing...

4102
02:44:15,710 --> 02:44:16,370
That was a...

4103
02:44:16,370 --> 02:44:17,130
Wait, he got a...

4104
02:44:17,130 --> 02:44:18,050
A kill streak.

4105
02:44:19,110 --> 02:44:19,410
Wow.

4106
02:44:19,690 --> 02:44:20,630
Just like that.

4107
02:44:20,950 --> 02:44:22,230
Space takes the lead.

4108
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:22,890
Guys.

4109
02:44:23,330 --> 02:44:24,110
He's heating up.

4110
02:44:24,170 --> 02:44:24,710
Hey, you got power.

4111
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:25,350
Guys.

4112
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:27,410
Who voted for Jez?

4113
02:44:31,210 --> 02:44:33,270
Who predicted Jez?

4114
02:44:33,890 --> 02:44:36,990
Oh, and he gets a pretty big drone!

4115
02:44:38,450 --> 02:44:39,730
Oh my god!

4116
02:44:39,730 --> 02:44:39,890
Oh my god!

4117
02:44:40,510 --> 02:44:40,750
Bro!

4118
02:44:41,270 --> 02:44:43,310
Space got an odd retire!

4119
02:44:45,890 --> 02:44:47,990
Wait, he's choking!

4120
02:44:48,950 --> 02:44:49,670
He's...

4121
02:44:49,670 --> 02:44:49,990
Hahaha!

4122
02:44:50,810 --> 02:44:52,230
Yummy, yummy point.

4123
02:44:52,670 --> 02:44:53,010
No!

4124
02:44:53,470 --> 02:44:55,250
Should have been...

4125
02:44:55,250 --> 02:44:57,570
Should have been on the underdog.

4126
02:44:58,070 --> 02:44:59,770
Should have been on the underdog, guys!

4127
02:45:01,690 --> 02:45:02,490
Jez, please!

4128
02:45:03,030 --> 02:45:03,070
Jez, please!

4129
02:45:03,070 --> 02:45:04,050
My doofy points!

4130
02:45:05,490 --> 02:45:06,730
Oh, it's getting close!

4131
02:45:07,030 --> 02:45:08,890
I blame your influence!

4132
02:45:09,370 --> 02:45:10,670
We got scammed!

4133
02:45:11,810 --> 02:45:12,910
Oh, it's tied, though!

4134
02:45:13,070 --> 02:45:13,870
Guys, it's tied!

4135
02:45:16,650 --> 02:45:17,130
Wait!

4136
02:45:17,550 --> 02:45:18,930
Wait, you still there's still hope!

4137
02:45:20,610 --> 02:45:22,010
Guys, why do you...

4138
02:45:22,010 --> 02:45:23,050
Guys, I manipulate...

4139
02:45:23,050 --> 02:45:26,790
I can easily manipulate the predictions.

4140
02:45:26,950 --> 02:45:29,670
What if I lied and he's not even retired?

4141
02:45:30,650 --> 02:45:32,530
You guys could have...

4142
02:45:32,530 --> 02:45:33,810
Liquipediated it.

4143
02:45:34,570 --> 02:45:35,210
Oh!

4144
02:45:35,490 --> 02:45:36,830
18 to 18!

4145
02:45:37,630 --> 02:45:39,650
Corden, you didn't even vote!

4146
02:45:39,830 --> 02:45:40,630
You have no say!

4147
02:45:41,030 --> 02:45:42,090
I looked at chat!

4148
02:45:42,410 --> 02:45:44,210
Chaz was like, you have no say!

4149
02:45:44,350 --> 02:45:45,550
You didn't even vote!

4150
02:45:46,110 --> 02:45:46,430
Oh!

4151
02:45:46,430 --> 02:45:47,630
Space, you're right, you're right!

4152
02:45:47,790 --> 02:45:48,190
Guys!

4153
02:45:48,910 --> 02:45:49,070
Guys!

4154
02:45:49,790 --> 02:45:50,970
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

4155
02:45:51,570 --> 02:45:52,050
That would've been nasty!

4156
02:45:52,530 --> 02:45:53,570
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

4157
02:45:53,650 --> 02:45:55,090
He's trying to hit the flick!

4158
02:45:56,430 --> 02:45:57,330
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

4159
02:45:57,390 --> 02:45:58,070
It's so close!

4160
02:45:59,730 --> 02:46:01,170
Really wanted to make Jez play to him.

4161
02:46:01,250 --> 02:46:02,810
Kind of lame, but...

4162
02:46:02,810 --> 02:46:03,570
Hey, the dub's a dub.

4163
02:46:03,750 --> 02:46:03,950
Excuse him.

4164
02:46:04,130 --> 02:46:05,210
Jez has to play...

4165
02:46:05,210 --> 02:46:05,630
Oh!

4166
02:46:05,870 --> 02:46:07,450
He's just trying to wall bang it.

4167
02:46:07,950 --> 02:46:08,830
One minute left to go.

4168
02:46:09,010 --> 02:46:10,570
Space can win it here with a kill.

4169
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:11,590
Oh!

4170
02:46:12,070 --> 02:46:13,090
That's so close!

4171
02:46:14,370 --> 02:46:15,890
Jez needs to hit one shot.

4172
02:46:15,890 --> 02:46:16,550
I am.

4173
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:16,570
I am.

4174
02:46:17,850 --> 02:46:19,030
There's one minute left.

4175
02:46:19,230 --> 02:46:20,790
And Jez is...

4176
02:46:20,790 --> 02:46:22,070
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

4177
02:46:22,090 --> 02:46:22,490
Hit Marker.

4178
02:46:23,370 --> 02:46:24,670
Oh, my God!

4179
02:46:24,910 --> 02:46:26,050
Bro, Jez's movement!

4180
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:27,930
Bro, Jez's movement!

4181
02:46:28,190 --> 02:46:30,230
Jez has to get a kill though, to tie this up!

4182
02:46:30,430 --> 02:46:31,350
Jez doesn't have much time.

4183
02:46:31,510 --> 02:46:32,430
40 seconds left.

4184
02:46:33,090 --> 02:46:35,970
Bro, bro, that movement is crazy.

4185
02:46:36,570 --> 02:46:39,510
I wonder what Jez's POV is though for this.

4186
02:46:39,770 --> 02:46:42,830
The problem though, Space knows exactly where he is, so he kind of does this check and...

4187
02:46:42,830 --> 02:46:43,350
Oh, here it is.

4188
02:46:43,450 --> 02:46:44,230
Here we go, here we go.

4189
02:46:44,310 --> 02:46:45,030
Oh, he doesn't sell!

4190
02:46:45,030 --> 02:46:46,030
He doesn't see him!

4191
02:46:46,210 --> 02:46:46,470
He doesn't see him!

4192
02:46:46,470 --> 02:46:46,930
Oh!

4193
02:46:47,090 --> 02:46:47,610
Oh, no, he's...

4194
02:46:47,610 --> 02:46:49,050
Oh, he's just juking him!

4195
02:46:49,730 --> 02:46:50,070
Oh!

4196
02:46:52,850 --> 02:46:53,090
Oh!

4197
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:53,490
Got it!

4198
02:46:53,990 --> 02:46:54,650
Space takes it!

4199
02:46:54,910 --> 02:46:55,350
Let's go!

4200
02:46:56,530 --> 02:46:57,870
What a crutch!

4201
02:46:58,010 --> 02:46:58,430
Jez, oh!

4202
02:46:58,630 --> 02:46:58,690
What a crutch!

4203
02:46:58,690 --> 02:46:58,870
Jez, oh!

4204
02:46:58,870 --> 02:47:00,390
What a crutch!

4205
02:47:00,390 --> 02:47:00,610
Jez, you blew it!

4206
02:47:00,610 --> 02:47:01,890
Jez, you blew it!

4207
02:47:02,410 --> 02:47:04,690
Even that, you're talking about winning a...

4208
02:47:04,690 --> 02:47:06,070
The underdog!

4209
02:47:08,210 --> 02:47:10,250
Jez, you ruined me!

4210
02:47:10,250 --> 02:47:12,990
It's fail time, baby!

4211
02:47:13,490 --> 02:47:13,810
I know, yeah.

4212
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:14,770
Fail time!

4213
02:47:14,770 --> 02:47:15,150
Fail time!

4214
02:47:16,390 --> 02:47:17,210
My goal!

4215
02:47:17,650 --> 02:47:18,110
Get going!

4216
02:47:18,610 --> 02:47:20,410
It's gonna be cold games though, I can't lie!

4217
02:47:21,070 --> 02:47:24,290
Choose outcome in space again!

4218
02:47:25,130 --> 02:47:25,690
All right!

4219
02:47:26,710 --> 02:47:28,450
How do they do that?

4220
02:47:28,630 --> 02:47:29,350
It's like...

4221
02:47:29,350 --> 02:47:30,290
It's just...

4222
02:47:30,290 --> 02:47:30,830
It makes...

4223
02:47:30,830 --> 02:47:32,090
It's actually genuinely...

4224
02:47:32,090 --> 02:47:33,470
That's how I'm saying...

4225
02:47:33,470 --> 02:47:33,930
You should...

4226
02:47:33,930 --> 02:47:34,250
Why?

4227
02:47:34,430 --> 02:47:36,530
It's like how people like...

4228
02:47:36,530 --> 02:47:38,330
Manipulate like...

4229
02:47:38,330 --> 02:47:40,250
The stocks by saying like...

4230
02:47:40,250 --> 02:47:42,670
Things that might not be true...

4231
02:47:42,670 --> 02:47:43,850
And why did you...

4232
02:47:43,850 --> 02:47:45,610
And it's like...

4233
02:47:45,610 --> 02:47:46,450
When he's using that...

4234
02:47:46,450 --> 02:47:47,510
Semi-auto type of...

4235
02:47:47,510 --> 02:47:49,230
It's just like...

4236
02:47:49,230 --> 02:47:49,430
The...

4237
02:47:49,430 --> 02:47:50,270
Your ability...

4238
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:50,950
Oh, yep!

4239
02:47:51,690 --> 02:47:52,570
Now you know!

4240
02:47:53,330 --> 02:47:53,670
Hahaha!

4241
02:47:54,570 --> 02:47:55,610
There are people who like...

4242
02:47:55,610 --> 02:47:58,510
Imagine doubting space...

4243
02:47:58,510 --> 02:47:59,970
Inside a tree!

4244
02:48:00,590 --> 02:48:01,950
Jez, lock the...

4245
02:48:02,890 --> 02:48:03,570
Manipulate!

4246
02:48:03,590 --> 02:48:04,030
Hahaha!

4247
02:48:05,950 --> 02:48:06,390
All right!

4248
02:48:06,730 --> 02:48:07,750
All right, guys!

4249
02:48:08,030 --> 02:48:08,710
Next round!

4250
02:48:09,330 --> 02:48:09,790
Hahaha!

4251
02:48:10,670 --> 02:48:11,970
Next round, guys!

4252
02:48:12,610 --> 02:48:13,090
These...

4253
02:48:13,090 --> 02:48:15,070
Does anyone still believe in Jez?

4254
02:48:15,310 --> 02:48:15,390
Alright, well, hey!

4255
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:17,010
Start prediction!

4256
02:48:17,970 --> 02:48:20,030
That's two really close...

4257
02:48:20,030 --> 02:48:20,730
Okay...

4258
02:48:20,730 --> 02:48:21,710
Jez...

4259
02:48:21,710 --> 02:48:22,250
Versus...

4260
02:48:23,090 --> 02:48:23,510
Jez...

4261
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:24,470
We still gotta...

4262
02:48:25,090 --> 02:48:27,050
Jez who will lock in!

4263
02:48:27,710 --> 02:48:28,170
Hahaha!

4264
02:48:28,950 --> 02:48:29,870
I'm trying to remind myself!

4265
02:48:30,170 --> 02:48:30,670
Maybe I'll...

4266
02:48:30,670 --> 02:48:31,690
I'll put it in five minutes!

4267
02:48:32,130 --> 02:48:32,450
Hey!

4268
02:48:33,150 --> 02:48:33,570
Yes!

4269
02:48:33,890 --> 02:48:34,550
And D!

4270
02:48:34,850 --> 02:48:35,370
Okay, I like that!

4271
02:48:35,450 --> 02:48:36,770
In search and destroy...

4272
02:48:36,770 --> 02:48:37,410
It's Jez...

4273
02:48:37,410 --> 02:48:38,810
There's still Jez believers!

4274
02:48:39,230 --> 02:48:40,890
Who is a Jez believer?

4275
02:48:41,230 --> 02:48:41,650
Right now!

4276
02:48:42,130 --> 02:48:42,470
Hahaha!

4277
02:48:43,090 --> 02:48:44,070
If you've seen...

4278
02:48:44,070 --> 02:48:44,490
Really anything...

4279
02:48:44,490 --> 02:48:45,350
I would...

4280
02:48:45,350 --> 02:48:49,170
Jez, I would still use my last minutes of points for you!

4281
02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:50,530
They have it in series all the time.

4282
02:48:50,670 --> 02:48:51,610
It's like a competitive map.

4283
02:48:51,970 --> 02:48:52,630
People love it.

4284
02:48:52,830 --> 02:48:53,270
So...

4285
02:48:53,270 --> 02:48:53,970
Obviously the...

4286
02:48:53,970 --> 02:48:56,350
The next game mode is search and destroy.

4287
02:48:56,530 --> 02:48:58,990
I'm helping out the squad of how they want to go ahead and play this.

4288
02:48:59,290 --> 02:48:59,310
Exactly.

4289
02:48:59,550 --> 02:48:59,670
Yeah.

4290
02:48:59,850 --> 02:49:00,930
I used to recap it on that map back then.

4291
02:49:00,930 --> 02:49:01,410
Let's see...

4292
02:49:01,410 --> 02:49:02,430
Let's see what it is.

4293
02:49:02,530 --> 02:49:02,770
Oh!

4294
02:49:02,850 --> 02:49:04,950
People are voting for space now!

4295
02:49:05,570 --> 02:49:05,910
Hahaha!

4296
02:49:07,910 --> 02:49:08,770
You're just like...

4297
02:49:08,770 --> 02:49:09,910
It'll be different!

4298
02:49:10,430 --> 02:49:11,690
Did I use the Galil?

4299
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:12,310
I don't remember...

4300
02:49:12,310 --> 02:49:12,950
This is it!

4301
02:49:13,750 --> 02:49:14,190
Jez!

4302
02:49:14,290 --> 02:49:16,110
This is where you lock in!

4303
02:49:16,610 --> 02:49:17,290
Oh, oh, oh!

4304
02:49:17,290 --> 02:49:17,990
You was one of those!

4305
02:49:18,430 --> 02:49:19,610
You went up on that...

4306
02:49:19,610 --> 02:49:21,270
You went up on that ladder up top!

4307
02:49:21,430 --> 02:49:22,230
Oh, man!

4308
02:49:22,890 --> 02:49:24,210
Jez, you got this!

4309
02:49:24,210 --> 02:49:26,410
I feel like that once my friends started talking about KD...

4310
02:49:26,410 --> 02:49:29,530
I can't even highlight my message!

4311
02:49:30,090 --> 02:49:30,150
Yeah!

4312
02:49:30,190 --> 02:49:31,150
He's so...

4313
02:49:31,150 --> 02:49:32,690
You're so broke now!

4314
02:49:33,070 --> 02:49:33,770
I think there's a lot of...

4315
02:49:33,770 --> 02:49:34,730
I'm gonna be really curious.

4316
02:49:34,850 --> 02:49:37,450
Especially, obviously, we see, like, a bunch of snipers coming on out.

4317
02:49:37,610 --> 02:49:41,290
Like, we're gonna see people just, like, looking down range with a bunch of the snipers.

4318
02:49:41,630 --> 02:49:43,110
Just trying to be able to catch these people off.

4319
02:49:43,270 --> 02:49:45,650
But, let's just say, hypothetically...

4320
02:49:45,650 --> 02:49:48,310
Going down on the jet ship!

4321
02:49:48,450 --> 02:49:48,730
Hahaha!

4322
02:49:50,530 --> 02:49:51,250
You're like...

4323
02:49:51,250 --> 02:49:53,110
You're the captain that goes down...

4324
02:49:53,110 --> 02:49:53,990
With this ship.

4325
02:49:54,770 --> 02:49:56,230
You're like, this is it!

4326
02:49:56,970 --> 02:49:57,010
Hahaha!

4327
02:49:58,030 --> 02:50:00,490
Jez will eventually pick it up!

4328
02:50:01,430 --> 02:50:03,930
Okay, now, the real question for me is...

4329
02:50:03,930 --> 02:50:07,970
I can highlight my message just to laugh at that guy!

4330
02:50:10,330 --> 02:50:14,050
Yeah, I feel like if you remake it, like, twice, then it should be in the conversation.

4331
02:50:14,270 --> 02:50:17,810
Imagine losing your points for not believing in space!

4332
02:50:18,670 --> 02:50:19,070
It might...

4333
02:50:19,070 --> 02:50:21,630
Might be the most remade map we've had!

4334
02:50:21,830 --> 02:50:22,350
It's up there!

4335
02:50:22,350 --> 02:50:22,390
What?

4336
02:50:22,670 --> 02:50:23,870
Is it more than Nuketown?

4337
02:50:23,990 --> 02:50:29,150
Oh, it looks like a lot of Jez supporters have swapped over to space!

4338
02:50:30,310 --> 02:50:30,750
100%.

4339
02:50:30,750 --> 02:50:32,050
Nuketown, not in there.

4340
02:50:32,150 --> 02:50:32,910
But it might be up there.

4341
02:50:33,010 --> 02:50:33,950
That's a good shot.

4342
02:50:34,050 --> 02:50:34,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4343
02:50:34,550 --> 02:50:37,070
I think it definitely is fun to look at.

4344
02:50:37,190 --> 02:50:38,030
I think it's my favorite.

4345
02:50:38,070 --> 02:50:38,490
He didn't believe.

4346
02:50:39,570 --> 02:50:40,230
Is that crazy?

4347
02:50:40,610 --> 02:50:44,130
All those people that never believe in Jez, he's gonna prove you wrong!

4348
02:50:44,930 --> 02:50:46,550
Imagine going all in!

4349
02:50:46,550 --> 02:50:47,410
Hahaha!

4350
02:50:48,470 --> 02:50:49,350
No loyalty!

4351
02:50:50,050 --> 02:50:52,710
Those are the fake Jez Leavers!

4352
02:50:53,050 --> 02:50:53,510
Hahaha!

4353
02:50:56,790 --> 02:50:58,950
There's 53 Jez!

4354
02:50:59,110 --> 02:51:00,710
And 33 space!

4355
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:05,050
But space stands are just richer!

4356
02:51:06,550 --> 02:51:07,950
What can I say?

4357
02:51:08,090 --> 02:51:09,390
The rich get richer, guys!

4358
02:51:10,050 --> 02:51:10,950
Sorry, Jez!

4359
02:51:11,070 --> 02:51:12,750
You failed me!

4360
02:51:13,150 --> 02:51:14,330
Fooled me once!

4361
02:51:14,590 --> 02:51:15,590
Shame on you!

4362
02:51:16,150 --> 02:51:17,370
Fooled me twice!

4363
02:51:17,730 --> 02:51:19,590
I love space now!

4364
02:51:19,590 --> 02:51:19,890
Hahaha!

4365
02:51:23,230 --> 02:51:24,990
I am a space stand now!

4366
02:51:25,690 --> 02:51:26,050
To six?

4367
02:51:26,210 --> 02:51:27,370
There's no round elevens.

4368
02:51:27,570 --> 02:51:27,790
Oh.

4369
02:51:27,890 --> 02:51:29,930
You play to seven, but you have to win by two.

4370
02:51:30,390 --> 02:51:31,850
So if you don't win by two...

4371
02:51:31,850 --> 02:51:32,010
That's so tough.

4372
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:33,290
Yeah, it keeps going.

4373
02:51:33,730 --> 02:51:34,950
Oh, that's so crazy!

4374
02:51:35,270 --> 02:51:37,310
So it was 9-7 in the game.

4375
02:51:37,810 --> 02:51:37,930
That is momentum.

4376
02:51:38,090 --> 02:51:38,710
Alright, guys.

4377
02:51:38,990 --> 02:51:40,690
It could be final round.

4378
02:51:41,430 --> 02:51:42,090
That's tough.

4379
02:51:42,310 --> 02:51:42,870
Oh my god.

4380
02:51:43,430 --> 02:51:44,390
That's intense.

4381
02:51:45,110 --> 02:51:45,230
Yeah.

4382
02:51:45,550 --> 02:51:46,630
I think this is great.

4383
02:51:47,010 --> 02:51:47,270
Alright, here we go!

4384
02:51:47,270 --> 02:51:49,430
Who has been a space believer since the beginning?

4385
02:51:49,430 --> 02:51:51,610
Who has had a two out of two?

4386
02:51:51,910 --> 02:51:53,770
They're looking locked on in.

4387
02:51:53,950 --> 02:51:54,330
Up 2-0!

4388
02:51:54,330 --> 02:51:55,770
Let's see who's gonna take the sandbag challenge.

4389
02:51:55,890 --> 02:51:57,250
Oh, nobody took the sandbag challenge.

4390
02:51:57,410 --> 02:51:58,090
That's like...

4391
02:51:58,090 --> 02:51:59,210
Not me.

4392
02:51:59,550 --> 02:51:59,810
Hahaha!

4393
02:52:01,810 --> 02:52:02,150
Never!

4394
02:52:03,150 --> 02:52:04,250
Rated's been here before.

4395
02:52:07,630 --> 02:52:08,090
Oh!

4396
02:52:10,530 --> 02:52:12,250
Alright, let's see who gets the first kill.

4397
02:52:13,610 --> 02:52:14,710
It's search and destroy.

4398
02:52:15,210 --> 02:52:16,450
Wall bang right there.

4399
02:52:16,450 --> 02:52:17,030
Let's see.

4400
02:52:17,030 --> 02:52:18,030
Uh...

4401
02:52:18,030 --> 02:52:18,510
Oh!

4402
02:52:18,710 --> 02:52:19,770
Space lost the first...

4403
02:52:19,770 --> 02:52:20,710
First kill.

4404
02:52:23,950 --> 02:52:24,450
Oh!

4405
02:52:24,670 --> 02:52:25,670
Oh!

4406
02:52:26,650 --> 02:52:27,150
Oh!

4407
02:52:27,150 --> 02:52:27,210
Oh!

4408
02:52:27,590 --> 02:52:27,910
Guys!

4409
02:52:28,210 --> 02:52:29,570
Just died!

4410
02:52:32,510 --> 02:52:32,870
Hahaha!

4411
02:52:34,390 --> 02:52:34,890
Hahaha!

4412
02:52:35,670 --> 02:52:35,930
Guys!

4413
02:52:37,230 --> 02:52:37,810
Hahaha!

4414
02:52:38,630 --> 02:52:38,710
Hahaha!

4415
02:52:38,710 --> 02:52:38,830
He...

4416
02:52:38,830 --> 02:52:39,890
Hahaha!

4417
02:52:46,990 --> 02:52:51,850
You have enough time to have like how people started voting after the first game.

4418
02:52:52,170 --> 02:52:54,630
After the first match because there's no time.

4419
02:52:54,910 --> 02:52:56,950
People are like, okay, all in on space now.

4420
02:52:57,470 --> 02:52:57,590
Okay.

4421
02:52:57,910 --> 02:52:58,350
Hahaha!

4422
02:53:00,470 --> 02:53:01,150
They were smart.

4423
02:53:01,450 --> 02:53:02,710
Those people were smart.

4424
02:53:02,710 --> 02:53:02,790
Alright.

4425
02:53:02,930 --> 02:53:04,490
They waited until the first match.

4426
02:53:04,750 --> 02:53:06,330
The first round was over.

4427
02:53:06,830 --> 02:53:09,210
See, this is the nerd stuff that I was waiting for.

4428
02:53:09,350 --> 02:53:10,610
What are the hop ups?

4429
02:53:10,890 --> 02:53:12,170
What are the pre-nades?

4430
02:53:12,410 --> 02:53:13,950
Are you trying to hit these wall bangs?

4431
02:53:14,090 --> 02:53:15,370
You can see a lot of these players.

4432
02:53:15,730 --> 02:53:16,430
It's okay.

4433
02:53:16,670 --> 02:53:17,510
Bigger bonus.

4434
02:53:17,510 --> 02:53:19,350
They're trying to make their way over to this A site.

4435
02:53:19,850 --> 02:53:21,510
Jacob in the chat that he wants to see a hand.

4436
02:53:21,510 --> 02:53:24,330
Just support your silent right now.

4437
02:53:24,790 --> 02:53:25,090
Hahaha!

4438
02:53:27,290 --> 02:53:29,370
I like how the guy was like, no, I'm just crying.

4439
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:32,810
I can't type with the tears in my eyes.

4440
02:53:33,190 --> 02:53:33,290
Please.

4441
02:53:34,770 --> 02:53:35,330
Your life.

4442
02:53:35,630 --> 02:53:35,710
Yeah.

4443
02:53:36,810 --> 02:53:37,450
Wait, wait.

4444
02:53:37,670 --> 02:53:38,570
Just got two though.

4445
02:53:38,890 --> 02:53:39,570
It's like throwing a shoulder.

4446
02:53:40,170 --> 02:53:40,790
Kinda looking in.

4447
02:53:40,850 --> 02:53:42,070
You got two people looking at you.

4448
02:53:42,190 --> 02:53:43,150
He gets taken out.

4449
02:53:43,290 --> 02:53:43,670
Oh!

4450
02:53:44,270 --> 02:53:44,470
Guys!

4451
02:53:44,650 --> 02:53:44,850
Wait!

4452
02:53:46,110 --> 02:53:47,210
Just leave it!

4453
02:53:47,450 --> 02:53:48,330
You have a chance!

4454
02:53:48,490 --> 02:53:49,290
They won a round!

4455
02:53:54,250 --> 02:53:55,590
Wait, hold on.

4456
02:53:56,330 --> 02:53:57,690
Just, just, just!

4457
02:53:58,830 --> 02:53:59,870
How many have you...

4458
02:53:59,870 --> 02:54:00,650
do you think you've hit?

4459
02:54:00,810 --> 02:54:01,450
I'm lying.

4460
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:02,150
I haven't hit that one.

4461
02:54:02,770 --> 02:54:03,450
I threw them though.

4462
02:54:03,870 --> 02:54:04,450
All the time.

4463
02:54:04,870 --> 02:54:05,110
He tried.

4464
02:54:05,150 --> 02:54:06,390
This is it, guys!

4465
02:54:06,850 --> 02:54:07,290
Hahaha!

4466
02:54:08,190 --> 02:54:09,470
Oh, it's so close.

4467
02:54:10,050 --> 02:54:10,650
Oh, wait!

4468
02:54:10,910 --> 02:54:11,970
Space is almost...

4469
02:54:11,970 --> 02:54:12,490
Oh!

4470
02:54:18,290 --> 02:54:19,450
Space, don't you dare.

4471
02:54:19,630 --> 02:54:20,490
Best of luck for me!

4472
02:54:20,990 --> 02:54:22,270
That, it makes no sense.

4473
02:54:22,350 --> 02:54:22,990
I gotta stop, bro.

4474
02:54:23,250 --> 02:54:23,410
No, I ain't!

4475
02:54:23,590 --> 02:54:24,350
I gotta stop, bro.

4476
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:24,930
I gotta stop, bro.

4477
02:54:25,110 --> 02:54:26,330
I gotta stop, bro.

4478
02:54:26,430 --> 02:54:29,250
While I'm going down here, able to escape with his life.

4479
02:54:31,690 --> 02:54:32,050
Oh...

4480
02:54:32,050 --> 02:54:32,930
What's going on?

4481
02:54:34,710 --> 02:54:36,610
Oh, Space didn't take the shot.

4482
02:54:37,690 --> 02:54:39,310
Wait, is that not wall-bangable?

4483
02:54:41,610 --> 02:54:43,390
Oh, it's Space versus Earth.

4484
02:54:44,970 --> 02:54:49,030
Guys, what if, like, that first round was a bait all along?

4485
02:54:50,930 --> 02:54:59,430
All the people that waited till the last round to vote, till the first round to vote, you guys got baited.

4486
02:54:59,430 --> 02:55:00,710
Two down, hold on, wait.

4487
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:02,090
Oh, unless...

4488
02:55:02,790 --> 02:55:03,910
Three down, wait.

4489
02:55:04,150 --> 02:55:04,910
He can't defuse.

4490
02:55:09,470 --> 02:55:11,010
Oh, oh, there's my phone.

4491
02:55:11,130 --> 02:55:11,610
I'll be right back.

4492
02:55:12,490 --> 02:55:15,190
At that point, he just did that, just for his own pride.

4493
02:55:15,450 --> 02:55:18,110
Try and reset, try and reset streaks.

4494
02:55:18,370 --> 02:55:18,370
Yeah.

4495
02:55:18,610 --> 02:55:19,530
And also just feel good.

4496
02:55:20,150 --> 02:55:21,130
Like, keep the fingers hot.

4497
02:55:22,650 --> 02:55:26,570
I'd like to see him maybe get one or two and then try and back up, maybe keep his own streaks, but...

4498
02:55:26,570 --> 02:55:29,170
Dude, you're getting hit markers on this every time.

4499
02:55:29,430 --> 02:55:32,350
Yo, Space is absolutely going crazy right now.

4500
02:55:33,430 --> 02:55:34,550
It's a good spot here.

4501
02:55:35,130 --> 02:55:35,490
Lucky.

4502
02:55:37,290 --> 02:55:38,110
I kind of like this.

4503
02:55:38,110 --> 02:55:42,650
What we see a lot of our creators do, they kind of, like, find this, like, they find a corner and they're just holding it.

4504
02:55:42,750 --> 02:55:44,070
They're waiting for somebody to run on by.

4505
02:55:44,650 --> 02:55:52,510
We've seen Aiden do it a number of times, where he's just kind of, like, literally preying on somebody just running forward, straight into his guns.

4506
02:55:53,490 --> 02:55:54,210
Here we go.

4507
02:55:54,330 --> 02:55:55,250
Rated pushing up here.

4508
02:55:55,410 --> 02:55:56,610
Maybe catching somebody off guard.

4509
02:55:56,790 --> 02:55:57,430
Yes, he does.

4510
02:55:58,450 --> 02:55:58,870
It's Noemi.

4511
02:55:59,110 --> 02:55:59,510
Good shot.

4512
02:55:59,730 --> 02:56:01,010
He's going to back the team up, too.

4513
02:56:02,410 --> 02:56:03,250
3v3 still.

4514
02:56:04,550 --> 02:56:04,990
Momentum.

4515
02:56:05,530 --> 02:56:06,830
Does have bomb planted.

4516
02:56:07,610 --> 02:56:09,230
Take down Aiden, but the trades are there.

4517
02:56:09,470 --> 02:56:10,470
Still a 2v2.

4518
02:56:10,470 --> 02:56:12,250
Last man standing.

4519
02:56:12,710 --> 02:56:13,130
Finish it.

4520
02:56:14,770 --> 02:56:15,350
Primrose.

4521
02:56:15,830 --> 02:56:17,330
1v1 against Jez.

4522
02:56:18,110 --> 02:56:18,690
Oh!

4523
02:56:20,590 --> 02:56:21,170
That's...

4524
02:56:21,170 --> 02:56:21,890
That's disrespectful.

4525
02:56:21,890 --> 02:56:22,330
That's just disrespectful.

4526
02:56:22,770 --> 02:56:23,950
Nasty jump shot.

4527
02:56:24,810 --> 02:56:25,750
Oh, God.

4528
02:56:26,310 --> 02:56:27,190
You only throw Rose out.

4529
02:56:27,270 --> 02:56:28,270
That's a heat check right there.

4530
02:56:28,390 --> 02:56:29,110
A jump shot.

4531
02:56:29,110 --> 02:56:30,070
Oh, God.

4532
02:56:32,330 --> 02:56:32,730
Wow.

4533
02:56:38,710 --> 02:56:40,790
Opportunity for Primrose to lock it on in.

4534
02:56:40,870 --> 02:56:41,570
Hopped on the bomb.

4535
02:56:41,730 --> 02:56:42,930
It's really all you can do in that moment.

4536
02:56:43,930 --> 02:56:44,330
Unfortunately.

4537
02:56:45,570 --> 02:56:46,970
You got Jez hitting shots like that.

4538
02:56:47,110 --> 02:56:47,590
It's going to be tough.

4539
02:56:48,650 --> 02:56:49,690
I'm loving this A side.

4540
02:56:51,050 --> 02:56:52,710
Everybody's really only playing A.

4541
02:56:53,170 --> 02:56:54,270
Is that space that just dropped?

4542
02:56:55,010 --> 02:56:55,570
Uh-oh.

4543
02:56:55,750 --> 02:56:56,130
That was.

4544
02:56:56,290 --> 02:56:56,670
Yeah, that's tough.

4545
02:56:57,970 --> 02:56:59,690
We can't even talk about the round.

4546
02:56:59,690 --> 02:57:00,730
It's a 4-1.

4547
02:57:00,930 --> 02:57:01,110
Wow.

4548
02:57:01,370 --> 02:57:02,030
That was round.

4549
02:57:02,170 --> 02:57:02,790
As soon as he said...

4550
02:57:02,790 --> 02:57:02,890
Wow.

4551
02:57:02,930 --> 02:57:04,390
As soon as space dropped...

4552
02:57:05,270 --> 02:57:06,110
Loki looked away.

4553
02:57:06,270 --> 02:57:06,870
I'm not going to lie.

4554
02:57:06,950 --> 02:57:09,710
When somebody's so dominant, though, you might as well just...

4555
02:57:09,710 --> 02:57:12,130
Your whole game plan needs to be just take them out first.

4556
02:57:12,470 --> 02:57:12,670
Yeah, yeah.

4557
02:57:12,770 --> 02:57:15,970
As soon as I get killed by him, I'm telling my whole team, let's get this training.

4558
02:57:16,410 --> 02:57:16,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4559
02:57:16,510 --> 02:57:18,630
If I even see him on the map, I'm calm with that.

4560
02:57:18,830 --> 02:57:19,030
Yeah.

4561
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:21,330
I got to make sure everybody knows where space is.

4562
02:57:23,570 --> 02:57:24,590
Alright, back on up.

4563
02:57:25,390 --> 02:57:26,450
Hey, we could see kind of a wrap.

4564
02:57:27,010 --> 02:57:28,450
Looks like they have cleared B.

4565
02:57:28,450 --> 02:57:36,990
Yeah, and I don't want to go for 3-4-3, but like, what would be the odds of a comeback here at 4-1?

4566
02:57:37,530 --> 02:57:38,290
I mean, hey.

4567
02:57:38,410 --> 02:57:40,070
It could happen.

4568
02:57:40,290 --> 02:57:45,210
I will say, though, this Momentum team has looked insane at Search and Destroy all day long.

4569
02:57:46,830 --> 02:57:48,150
Shots don't land.

4570
02:57:48,150 --> 02:57:49,510
Okay, still 3-4.

4571
02:57:50,230 --> 02:57:52,490
I mean, space has an opportunity to do something crazy.

4572
02:57:52,650 --> 02:57:54,210
I have the sun on my screen right now.

4573
02:57:54,430 --> 02:57:54,610
Yeah.

4574
02:57:54,710 --> 02:57:56,290
I don't really know what's going on there.

4575
02:57:56,770 --> 02:57:57,170
Okay, thank you.

4576
02:57:59,450 --> 02:58:00,510
Noemi gets dropped.

4577
02:58:00,990 --> 02:58:02,010
2v3 right now.

4578
02:58:03,070 --> 02:58:03,530
Aiden.

4579
02:58:04,390 --> 02:58:05,570
From long range.

4580
02:58:06,410 --> 02:58:07,110
There it is.

4581
02:58:07,690 --> 02:58:07,850
Wow.

4582
02:58:08,070 --> 02:58:08,850
5-1.

4583
02:58:08,990 --> 02:58:09,630
It's not over yet.

4584
02:58:10,210 --> 02:58:11,770
Absolute domination is what it is.

4585
02:58:11,790 --> 02:58:13,590
Michael, 2-1 on these calls.

4586
02:58:13,970 --> 02:58:14,150
Yeah.

4587
02:58:14,350 --> 02:58:16,910
Hey, you guys said 3-1, man.

4588
02:58:16,910 --> 02:58:17,410
Yeah.

4589
02:58:17,510 --> 02:58:18,150
Oh, yeah.

4590
02:58:18,150 --> 02:58:19,030
Yeah, we did say 3-1.

4591
02:58:19,130 --> 02:58:20,050
We did say that.

4592
02:58:20,350 --> 02:58:20,430
Yeah.

4593
02:58:21,790 --> 02:58:23,010
See, that's my curse now.

4594
02:58:23,570 --> 02:58:24,770
Now the comeback starts.

4595
02:58:25,870 --> 02:58:27,290
Can't curse the curse, man.

4596
02:58:28,430 --> 02:58:29,210
There's limits.

4597
02:58:30,590 --> 02:58:31,490
I mean, I love this.

4598
02:58:31,650 --> 02:58:32,910
Jez just kind of throwing bullets.

4599
02:58:33,490 --> 02:58:34,750
What an angle there, too.

4600
02:58:34,870 --> 02:58:35,430
Like, what's the...

4601
02:58:35,430 --> 02:58:36,470
How would you even know who...

4602
02:58:36,470 --> 02:58:37,790
Good update.

4603
02:58:38,010 --> 02:58:38,470
Good update.

4604
02:58:38,750 --> 02:58:39,450
That's all I can say.

4605
02:58:39,870 --> 02:58:41,430
I'll update later on Twitter.

4606
02:58:41,650 --> 02:58:42,230
But good update.

4607
02:58:42,410 --> 02:58:42,530
Oh, we got shot.

4608
02:58:43,330 --> 02:58:44,210
Good update.

4609
02:58:44,470 --> 02:58:45,010
I'm happy.

4610
02:58:45,010 --> 02:58:46,210
Not, like, mad.

4611
02:58:46,390 --> 02:58:46,710
Yeah.

4612
02:58:47,310 --> 02:58:48,050
Yeah, I know.

4613
02:58:48,210 --> 02:58:48,470
Yeah, okay.

4614
02:58:48,630 --> 02:58:48,850
Alright.

4615
02:58:49,110 --> 02:58:49,470
Oh, wait.

4616
02:58:49,930 --> 02:58:50,650
Jez is winning?

4617
02:58:50,990 --> 02:58:51,510
Aw, man.

4618
02:58:52,270 --> 02:58:53,930
I should have kept believing.

4619
02:58:54,890 --> 02:58:55,850
Should have...

4620
02:58:55,850 --> 02:58:56,810
All the way in the back.

4621
02:58:57,690 --> 02:58:58,870
They can't hear us, right?

4622
02:58:59,850 --> 02:59:00,730
I would hope not.

4623
02:59:00,810 --> 02:59:03,190
I don't want to go home with nothing.

4624
02:59:04,350 --> 02:59:05,610
You shouldn't be able to.

4625
02:59:07,610 --> 02:59:09,010
You should have been more...

4626
02:59:09,010 --> 02:59:10,810
You should have believed in him.

4627
02:59:11,210 --> 02:59:13,710
Why didn't you believe in him?

4628
02:59:19,910 --> 02:59:20,790
I believe.

4629
02:59:22,670 --> 02:59:24,350
Is the comeback possible?

4630
02:59:24,590 --> 02:59:25,430
That's the question.

4631
02:59:25,970 --> 02:59:27,370
I mean, it starts here, right?

4632
02:59:28,470 --> 02:59:30,390
You just gotta take it one round at a time.

4633
02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:32,590
You're here now, back on offense.

4634
02:59:33,190 --> 02:59:36,590
And again, you're just kind of continually moving over towards this A site.

4635
02:59:36,590 --> 02:59:39,950
Everybody just flying their way on through.

4636
02:59:41,530 --> 02:59:42,910
Jez was zero.

4637
02:59:43,290 --> 02:59:43,970
Space was zero.

4638
02:59:43,970 --> 02:59:44,530
Space was zero.

4639
02:59:48,830 --> 02:59:51,350
Yeah, but this is Jez's world.

4640
02:59:52,010 --> 02:59:53,850
This is his search and destroy.

4641
02:59:55,530 --> 02:59:56,190
Space.

4642
02:59:56,190 --> 02:59:56,650
Space please.

4643
02:59:56,930 --> 02:59:58,310
I have a family.

4644
02:59:58,310 --> 03:00:00,270
I need to pay rent.

4645
03:00:05,650 --> 03:00:08,530
I need to pay rent.

4646
03:00:08,870 --> 03:00:11,950
Guys, what if I up the odds?

4647
03:00:12,430 --> 03:00:14,670
What if I make a point...

4648
03:00:14,670 --> 03:00:17,210
Make a redemption for VIP?

4649
03:00:18,070 --> 03:00:19,510
For the richest?

4650
03:00:19,510 --> 03:00:19,670
Just...

4651
03:00:19,670 --> 03:00:22,210
And I'll only give it to one person.

4652
03:00:22,770 --> 03:00:23,270
The real...

4653
03:00:29,130 --> 03:00:32,790
The gambling odds go up in prediction.

4654
03:00:33,390 --> 03:00:34,770
It goes up.

4655
03:00:34,950 --> 03:00:36,710
Now I'm interested.

4656
03:00:38,190 --> 03:00:39,410
Should have thought that.

4657
03:00:39,610 --> 03:00:40,890
Should have bet better.

4658
03:00:41,210 --> 03:00:43,030
Should have predicted better, guys.

4659
03:00:43,030 --> 03:00:45,510
Took a little too long there.

4660
03:00:45,610 --> 03:00:46,130
Yeah.

4661
03:00:46,370 --> 03:00:48,830
Space knew I placed a bet.

4662
03:00:49,430 --> 03:00:49,910
I tried.

4663
03:00:50,430 --> 03:00:52,150
That was your first mistake.

4664
03:00:55,850 --> 03:00:58,150
I used to be rich.

4665
03:01:01,850 --> 03:01:03,890
We increased the odds.

4666
03:01:08,650 --> 03:01:10,070
That's not fair.

4667
03:01:10,070 --> 03:01:13,250
Why didn't you mention it first?

4668
03:01:13,790 --> 03:01:14,550
Well...

4669
03:01:16,910 --> 03:01:18,450
Never bet against the house.

4670
03:01:18,650 --> 03:01:20,270
Never predict against the house.

4671
03:01:21,070 --> 03:01:23,930
Guys, one more point for...

4672
03:01:23,930 --> 03:01:25,210
One more point.

4673
03:01:25,370 --> 03:01:26,650
Jez just needs.

4674
03:01:27,370 --> 03:01:28,830
One more point.

4675
03:01:34,030 --> 03:01:36,810
I can't go more down, bro.

4676
03:01:42,570 --> 03:01:45,170
So many people were ruined by Jez.

4677
03:01:45,170 --> 03:01:45,590
So many people were ruined by Jez.

4678
03:01:46,110 --> 03:01:47,630
That's like one of those that you can do it.

4679
03:01:47,650 --> 03:01:48,330
He hits it?

4680
03:01:48,570 --> 03:01:49,250
Yeah, Aura.

4681
03:01:49,450 --> 03:01:50,210
Because he's farming it.

4682
03:01:50,310 --> 03:01:50,610
He's just...

4683
03:01:50,610 --> 03:01:51,350
He knows.

4684
03:01:51,650 --> 03:01:53,030
He heard about the prediction.

4685
03:01:53,370 --> 03:01:54,370
I'm going down straight away.

4686
03:01:54,650 --> 03:01:54,890
I like that.

4687
03:01:55,790 --> 03:01:57,430
See if he could escape with his life.

4688
03:01:58,250 --> 03:01:59,170
No, he's not even trying to.

4689
03:02:00,270 --> 03:02:00,670
Oh!

4690
03:02:01,730 --> 03:02:02,290
Maybe he should've.

4691
03:02:02,630 --> 03:02:03,590
He should've...

4692
03:02:03,590 --> 03:02:05,090
Why did he stay there?

4693
03:02:05,510 --> 03:02:07,410
Who was that guy?

4694
03:02:07,410 --> 03:02:07,550
Why?

4695
03:02:08,170 --> 03:02:10,010
Why did he stay there?

4696
03:02:10,410 --> 03:02:11,190
Gets one kill.

4697
03:02:11,430 --> 03:02:11,790
Grenade.

4698
03:02:14,810 --> 03:02:15,090
Oh!

4699
03:02:16,710 --> 03:02:16,870
Oh!

4700
03:02:16,870 --> 03:02:17,950
It's Space versus Jez.

4701
03:02:18,610 --> 03:02:18,730
Oh!

4702
03:02:18,730 --> 03:02:19,150
It's Jez.

4703
03:02:19,270 --> 03:02:19,410
Oh!

4704
03:02:19,670 --> 03:02:20,170
He's on the bomb.

4705
03:02:20,470 --> 03:02:21,070
Can you get him?

4706
03:02:21,330 --> 03:02:21,550
Oh!

4707
03:02:22,550 --> 03:02:22,570
Oh!

4708
03:02:22,970 --> 03:02:23,530
What?

4709
03:02:25,970 --> 03:02:28,110
He won feet five!

4710
03:02:28,930 --> 03:02:29,070
He's tough.

4711
03:02:29,470 --> 03:02:29,950
Here's the thing.

4712
03:02:30,030 --> 03:02:31,250
That was crazy.

4713
03:02:32,530 --> 03:02:33,250
He's tough.

4714
03:02:33,430 --> 03:02:33,790
He's tough.

4715
03:02:35,030 --> 03:02:35,910
He's tough.

4716
03:02:35,910 --> 03:02:36,610
Make sure you go check.

4717
03:02:36,670 --> 03:02:38,530
Alright, now do that again like three more times.

4718
03:02:38,810 --> 03:02:41,570
He just has to do it three more times, guys.

4719
03:02:44,170 --> 03:02:45,050
It's a fluke.

4720
03:02:49,250 --> 03:02:52,610
The Jez Leavers are like, he can't do that again.

4721
03:02:52,830 --> 03:02:53,610
That's a fluke.

4722
03:02:55,970 --> 03:02:57,790
There's no way he'll do that again.

4723
03:02:57,790 --> 03:02:57,950
Okay.

4724
03:02:58,410 --> 03:02:58,930
Okay.

4725
03:02:59,390 --> 03:03:00,210
Great start.

4726
03:03:00,590 --> 03:03:01,730
For Nebula Knights.

4727
03:03:03,550 --> 03:03:05,490
That's a risky angle hold.

4728
03:03:05,710 --> 03:03:06,570
Nah, this is his bot.

4729
03:03:06,770 --> 03:03:07,430
This is his domain.

4730
03:03:08,310 --> 03:03:10,190
Nobody goes into the space house.

4731
03:03:10,730 --> 03:03:11,810
If you're in my bad, man.

4732
03:03:14,690 --> 03:03:14,950
Oh.

4733
03:03:18,030 --> 03:03:18,930
They saw him.

4734
03:03:19,050 --> 03:03:19,690
They saw Aiden.

4735
03:03:20,230 --> 03:03:21,890
Unfortunately, Lucky doesn't win the fight.

4736
03:03:21,890 --> 03:03:22,350
Yeah.

4737
03:03:22,690 --> 03:03:23,090
Oh.

4738
03:03:23,670 --> 03:03:24,070
Wait.

4739
03:03:24,330 --> 03:03:24,530
Wait.

4740
03:03:24,750 --> 03:03:25,370
It's getting close.

4741
03:03:25,610 --> 03:03:25,790
Oh.

4742
03:03:27,110 --> 03:03:28,310
He didn't hesitate.

4743
03:03:28,470 --> 03:03:29,290
Jez was just waiting.

4744
03:03:30,710 --> 03:03:31,350
Here's Jez.

4745
03:03:31,430 --> 03:03:32,910
Let's see if Jez can make something happen.

4746
03:03:33,030 --> 03:03:33,930
You know, 1v3.

4747
03:03:35,270 --> 03:03:36,610
This would be insane.

4748
03:03:36,610 --> 03:03:39,070
But we've also seen him do it literally here today.

4749
03:03:39,270 --> 03:03:39,850
Oh, it's close.

4750
03:03:40,490 --> 03:03:41,730
He just needs to kill space.

4751
03:03:42,890 --> 03:03:43,170
Of the Knights.

4752
03:03:43,330 --> 03:03:44,490
They're playing on this bomb side.

4753
03:03:44,990 --> 03:03:45,630
He's gonna go ahead and check.

4754
03:03:45,710 --> 03:03:46,110
Oh.

4755
03:03:47,250 --> 03:03:47,650
He's...

4756
03:03:47,650 --> 03:03:48,230
He got it.

4757
03:03:48,510 --> 03:03:49,210
He won.

4758
03:03:49,630 --> 03:03:50,390
It's over.

4759
03:03:51,390 --> 03:03:52,590
It's over.

4760
03:03:52,850 --> 03:03:53,790
It's over.

4761
03:03:53,790 --> 03:03:54,390
Space should not...

4762
03:03:54,390 --> 03:03:55,210
I don't know why.

4763
03:03:55,510 --> 03:03:56,130
Oh.

4764
03:03:56,130 --> 03:03:57,130
It's over.

4765
03:03:57,990 --> 03:03:58,370
It's...

4766
03:03:58,370 --> 03:03:59,290
It's over.

4767
03:03:59,790 --> 03:04:00,370
He sees it.

4768
03:04:00,490 --> 03:04:00,870
The shots.

4769
03:04:01,110 --> 03:04:01,510
It misses.

4770
03:04:01,850 --> 03:04:01,970
Oh.

4771
03:04:03,430 --> 03:04:05,450
Space choked that.

4772
03:04:05,970 --> 03:04:09,150
Why did Space plant the bomb?

4773
03:04:10,110 --> 03:04:10,650
What?

4774
03:04:11,130 --> 03:04:12,110
There it is.

4775
03:04:12,110 --> 03:04:12,470
There it is.

4776
03:04:15,470 --> 03:04:18,750
Is this what winning feels like to the Jez leaders?

4777
03:04:18,750 --> 03:04:21,570
My code is washed.

4778
03:04:21,870 --> 03:04:21,930
My code is washed.

4779
03:04:21,930 --> 03:04:21,950
Yeah.

4780
03:04:22,350 --> 03:04:22,490
Wow.

4781
03:04:22,530 --> 03:04:23,410
I can see a lot of scores.

4782
03:04:24,430 --> 03:04:24,890
I just...

4783
03:04:24,890 --> 03:04:25,470
I saw a lot of...

4784
03:04:25,470 --> 03:04:27,210
Now they know what winning feels.

4785
03:04:27,610 --> 03:04:29,170
Loyalty to the end.

4786
03:04:29,610 --> 03:04:31,310
You were loyal to the end.

4787
03:04:31,530 --> 03:04:33,270
You were loyal to the end and you were rewarded for it.

4788
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:33,290
Yeah.

4789
03:04:33,290 --> 03:04:34,350
I don't know what to say.

4790
03:04:34,390 --> 03:04:35,790
It's like a different person's plan.

4791
03:04:36,170 --> 03:04:37,430
Space kind of run around.

4792
03:04:37,930 --> 03:04:40,350
Maybe they were thinking like this movement is the best.

4793
03:04:40,510 --> 03:04:42,310
So he can squeeze his way out of the situation.

4794
03:04:42,810 --> 03:04:43,190
Maybe.

4795
03:04:43,530 --> 03:04:45,170
Back to the mind.

4796
03:04:45,810 --> 03:04:45,890
Yeah.

4797
03:04:46,290 --> 03:04:46,790
Even the intel.

4798
03:04:47,030 --> 03:04:47,490
All right.

4799
03:04:48,010 --> 03:04:50,330
I said Jez who will lock in.

4800
03:04:50,650 --> 03:04:51,590
I did write that.

4801
03:04:51,590 --> 03:04:53,570
Here's game three right here.

4802
03:04:54,050 --> 03:04:55,030
Who would have thought?

4803
03:04:55,970 --> 03:04:57,470
I mean, I think you guys hit it on the head.

4804
03:04:57,730 --> 03:04:57,970
We did.

4805
03:04:58,310 --> 03:04:58,710
Space and Jez.

4806
03:04:58,790 --> 03:04:58,890
Yeah.

4807
03:04:59,090 --> 03:04:59,190
Yeah.

4808
03:05:00,650 --> 03:05:01,170
Yeah.

4809
03:05:02,190 --> 03:05:02,430
Yeah.

4810
03:05:02,610 --> 03:05:02,830
Yeah.

4811
03:05:03,930 --> 03:05:08,590
I like how Blazing was like, I lost 120 points.

4812
03:05:10,090 --> 03:05:11,130
Oh, Blazing.

4813
03:05:11,130 --> 03:05:13,790
There were a lot of points that were lost.

4814
03:05:14,750 --> 03:05:16,690
I think someone lost more.

4815
03:05:16,910 --> 03:05:18,290
I am pretty sure.

4816
03:05:21,770 --> 03:05:23,150
I lost 10k.

4817
03:05:23,730 --> 03:05:24,270
I lost 10k.

4818
03:05:24,330 --> 03:05:25,210
Is the other thing.

4819
03:05:25,330 --> 03:05:28,450
Is that like, that isn't just how we won the search and destroy.

4820
03:05:28,710 --> 03:05:30,170
No, we won this convincingly.

4821
03:05:30,750 --> 03:05:30,850
Yeah.

4822
03:05:31,770 --> 03:05:32,810
It kind of feels very...

4823
03:05:33,350 --> 03:05:35,010
Crying about 120?

4824
03:05:36,190 --> 03:05:40,070
If they have it here, if they can squeeze out a hard point, they should hopefully be feeling pretty good on that game.

4825
03:05:40,070 --> 03:05:40,450
All right.

4826
03:05:41,490 --> 03:05:43,450
More prediction, guys.

4827
03:05:45,650 --> 03:05:46,690
All right.

4828
03:05:46,890 --> 03:05:47,210
Let's see.

4829
03:05:48,150 --> 03:05:49,710
I was hoping to see something a little bit different.

4830
03:05:50,230 --> 03:05:50,610
You know what?

4831
03:05:51,730 --> 03:05:52,250
Space...

4832
03:05:53,610 --> 03:05:55,150
Takes a bath.

4833
03:05:59,030 --> 03:06:02,950
I like how Space baited a lot of you guys too.

4834
03:06:03,150 --> 03:06:06,210
In the first round, he baited all of you.

4835
03:06:06,390 --> 03:06:09,230
For the people who've waited until the match started.

4836
03:06:09,230 --> 03:06:11,630
And was like, oh yeah, Space is definitely gonna win this.

4837
03:06:11,830 --> 03:06:12,510
Aw, there were...

4838
03:06:12,510 --> 03:06:14,550
At least like 20k points were...

4839
03:06:14,550 --> 03:06:16,030
Were voted extra.

4840
03:06:16,030 --> 03:06:17,130
There's no...

4841
03:06:17,130 --> 03:06:19,070
Yeah, there's like the water on the outside.

4842
03:06:19,250 --> 03:06:19,410
Yeah.

4843
03:06:19,510 --> 03:06:20,650
I don't think you can swim in the water.

4844
03:06:20,770 --> 03:06:24,370
And there's no like, out of bounds fence hop that we see today in like...

4845
03:06:24,370 --> 03:06:24,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4846
03:06:26,410 --> 03:06:27,910
It kind of like shrinks the map a little bit.

4847
03:06:27,950 --> 03:06:30,010
This is the house money now.

4848
03:06:30,590 --> 03:06:32,850
The next game mode is hard point.

4849
03:06:32,850 --> 03:06:33,070
Yeah.

4850
03:06:33,390 --> 03:06:34,030
It's hard point.

4851
03:06:34,650 --> 03:06:35,530
I'ma let you...

4852
03:06:35,530 --> 03:06:35,590
I'ma let you...

4853
03:06:35,590 --> 03:06:35,770
I'ma let you...

4854
03:06:35,770 --> 03:06:37,910
God baited so hard.

4855
03:06:38,650 --> 03:06:39,730
We'll see it, but...

4856
03:06:39,730 --> 03:06:42,450
Man, I mean, as we get ready to hop on into the hard point...

4857
03:06:42,450 --> 03:06:44,490
Also Nomad, thank you for the 80 bitties.

4858
03:06:44,630 --> 03:06:45,490
Thank you, thank you.

4859
03:06:45,850 --> 03:06:45,890
Pretty close.

4860
03:06:45,890 --> 03:06:47,170
Until it wasn't.

4861
03:06:47,650 --> 03:06:48,050
Until...

4862
03:06:48,910 --> 03:06:51,030
Buy yourself something nice.

4863
03:06:51,030 --> 03:06:52,230
To all...

4864
03:06:52,230 --> 03:06:54,690
To all the people that lost on space.

4865
03:06:55,270 --> 03:06:55,410
It's not true.

4866
03:06:55,410 --> 03:06:56,090
God gate...

4867
03:06:56,090 --> 03:06:56,590
Look at that.

4868
03:06:56,850 --> 03:06:57,910
God gate is like...

4869
03:06:57,910 --> 03:06:59,330
Buy yourself something nice.

4870
03:07:01,390 --> 03:07:01,950
That's true.

4871
03:07:02,290 --> 03:07:02,410
Yeah.

4872
03:07:02,670 --> 03:07:03,650
Hey, that's passing.

4873
03:07:03,870 --> 03:07:04,490
Yeah, that's true.

4874
03:07:04,670 --> 03:07:06,070
I'm glad it's a good series though.

4875
03:07:06,190 --> 03:07:08,510
Like, I came in kind of with expectations, but...

4876
03:07:09,150 --> 03:07:10,610
All three games have been closed.

4877
03:07:10,790 --> 03:07:10,830
Yeah.

4878
03:07:10,830 --> 03:07:12,390
It's just a matter of who's been able to close out.

4879
03:07:12,570 --> 03:07:12,990
And here we go.

4880
03:07:13,170 --> 03:07:14,010
We got map number four.

4881
03:07:14,230 --> 03:07:14,530
All right.

4882
03:07:14,530 --> 03:07:15,450
It's hard point.

4883
03:07:15,930 --> 03:07:16,670
Here we go.

4884
03:07:17,110 --> 03:07:17,910
Hacienda hard point.

4885
03:07:17,910 --> 03:07:19,630
Space did win this one, guys.

4886
03:07:19,630 --> 03:07:20,090
Yeah.

4887
03:07:20,890 --> 03:07:21,610
Of course.

4888
03:07:21,890 --> 03:07:23,450
Space won this one though.

4889
03:07:23,950 --> 03:07:27,110
Currently up two maps to the momentum one.

4890
03:07:27,750 --> 03:07:29,070
Here we go.

4891
03:07:29,290 --> 03:07:31,370
P1 gonna be that fountain right in the middle.

4892
03:07:31,470 --> 03:07:32,350
Oh, that's good already.

4893
03:07:32,730 --> 03:07:32,950
Oh.

4894
03:07:33,530 --> 03:07:33,970
Wait.

4895
03:07:34,150 --> 03:07:34,770
Oh my God.

4896
03:07:35,390 --> 03:07:35,910
That was...

4897
03:07:35,910 --> 03:07:37,230
Wait, who got the...

4898
03:07:37,230 --> 03:07:38,910
Oh, Jez got the initial point.

4899
03:07:40,730 --> 03:07:45,790
So you're gonna have a lot of your teammates drop, unfortunately, to a bunch of team kills, which you hate to see, but...

4900
03:07:45,790 --> 03:07:47,390
Really, the thing here, P1, it's a scrub.

4901
03:07:47,390 --> 03:07:48,470
Oh, people are waiting.

4902
03:07:49,270 --> 03:07:52,290
Everyone's waiting until the last second of the vote right now.

4903
03:07:52,790 --> 03:07:54,230
Everyone's like, I'm not.

4904
03:07:54,910 --> 03:07:56,490
I need to know for sure.

4905
03:07:56,750 --> 03:07:58,030
This is for VIP.

4906
03:07:58,750 --> 03:07:59,470
This is...

4907
03:08:00,970 --> 03:08:01,210
Cow.

4908
03:08:01,510 --> 03:08:01,890
Hold.

4909
03:08:02,350 --> 03:08:05,010
And if you were like, you don't believe in them, you coward.

4910
03:08:11,470 --> 03:08:11,870
Coward.

4911
03:08:11,870 --> 03:08:12,010
Coward.

4912
03:08:13,450 --> 03:08:13,850
Pretty...

4913
03:08:13,850 --> 03:08:17,410
Pretty low score after P1, which we kinda go ahead and we expect, but...

4914
03:08:17,410 --> 03:08:19,850
You're gonna see there it's that bottom left as it comes on line.

4915
03:08:20,410 --> 03:08:23,110
You're really trying to hold this on in, make this mixy.

4916
03:08:23,110 --> 03:08:26,850
Remember the people who waited last time and they lost?

4917
03:08:27,610 --> 03:08:29,190
I'm a coward!

4918
03:08:30,050 --> 03:08:32,290
I lost so much!

4919
03:08:33,150 --> 03:08:34,150
Man, okay.

4920
03:08:34,390 --> 03:08:34,870
Nebula Knight.

4921
03:08:35,130 --> 03:08:35,370
They actually...

4922
03:08:35,870 --> 03:08:36,890
They got fights.

4923
03:08:36,990 --> 03:08:38,450
They let you get back on the point.

4924
03:08:38,990 --> 03:08:39,870
Oh, here we go.

4925
03:08:40,010 --> 03:08:40,470
Oh, shit.

4926
03:08:40,770 --> 03:08:41,170
Uh-oh.

4927
03:08:41,170 --> 03:08:42,250
They're desperate, guys!

4928
03:08:43,050 --> 03:08:44,010
They're desperate!

4929
03:08:47,090 --> 03:08:47,570
I see them here.

4930
03:08:47,570 --> 03:08:48,730
I see them here.

4931
03:08:49,590 --> 03:08:50,630
Oh, it's really close.

4932
03:08:50,950 --> 03:08:52,790
Oh, you can't even tell.

4933
03:08:53,050 --> 03:08:53,590
Cleared it out.

4934
03:08:53,690 --> 03:08:54,530
There's space again.

4935
03:08:55,150 --> 03:08:56,210
He's doing it again.

4936
03:08:56,450 --> 03:08:56,570
Oh!

4937
03:08:57,610 --> 03:08:58,490
It's close, though!

4938
03:08:59,330 --> 03:08:59,890
Oh, wow.

4939
03:09:00,850 --> 03:09:00,990
Okay.

4940
03:09:04,150 --> 03:09:05,770
Being able to fight back and forth.

4941
03:09:05,890 --> 03:09:06,890
That's what you love to see.

4942
03:09:07,650 --> 03:09:08,150
They feel nice.

4943
03:09:08,250 --> 03:09:10,150
They're still gonna have a lot of these close spawns, though.

4944
03:09:10,310 --> 03:09:12,270
So they're just gonna keep hitting this one out if they can.

4945
03:09:12,990 --> 03:09:13,990
Still plenty of time to fight.

4946
03:09:13,990 --> 03:09:14,850
No, it's 30.

4947
03:09:15,010 --> 03:09:16,450
What the gap is getting?

4948
03:09:16,710 --> 03:09:17,510
Alan, are you okay?

4949
03:09:18,090 --> 03:09:19,950
It's 34 to 35.

4950
03:09:20,730 --> 03:09:21,710
What do you mean?

4951
03:09:21,970 --> 03:09:23,390
The last remaining seconds on the hill.

4952
03:09:23,390 --> 03:09:28,090
You are cowards, and this is why S3 will forget you.

4953
03:09:33,650 --> 03:09:34,210
Wait!

4954
03:09:37,390 --> 03:09:39,630
Space is taking the lead right now!

4955
03:09:39,830 --> 03:09:41,250
I've already spawned on over here.

4956
03:09:41,350 --> 03:09:41,950
You got three members.

4957
03:09:42,090 --> 03:09:46,410
If Alan loses, I just vote against Alan every time.

4958
03:09:46,630 --> 03:09:47,130
Is that it?

4959
03:09:47,550 --> 03:09:49,450
Wait, Alan is 0-3.

4960
03:09:49,850 --> 03:09:50,270
Wait!

4961
03:09:50,550 --> 03:09:52,530
Okay, who's won all their bets so far?

4962
03:09:53,390 --> 03:09:54,150
Who's won all?

4963
03:09:57,370 --> 03:09:58,870
Who's got three out of three?

4964
03:10:01,210 --> 03:10:02,070
It's like the...

4965
03:10:02,070 --> 03:10:03,290
Remember like in the...

4966
03:10:03,290 --> 03:10:03,830
In the...

4967
03:10:03,830 --> 03:10:06,750
In the FIFA World Cup, there was the prediction squid?

4968
03:10:07,030 --> 03:10:08,310
Or the prediction octopus?

4969
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:10,050
Who's our prediction octopus?

4970
03:10:10,470 --> 03:10:11,990
Like that war machine, the grenade launcher.

4971
03:10:12,490 --> 03:10:12,970
It's just...

4972
03:10:12,970 --> 03:10:13,430
Overpowered.

4973
03:10:13,990 --> 03:10:15,310
That is crazy, man.

4974
03:10:15,470 --> 03:10:17,130
Well, I mean, think about breaking points, right?

4975
03:10:17,130 --> 03:10:18,010
I don't wanna...

4976
03:10:18,010 --> 03:10:20,530
I don't wanna talk about it.

4977
03:10:21,970 --> 03:10:23,550
Yeah, Paul the octopus!

4978
03:10:23,970 --> 03:10:24,610
Where are you?

4979
03:10:27,670 --> 03:10:29,310
The flank there from rated.

4980
03:10:30,830 --> 03:10:32,670
He's feeling right at home on this map.

4981
03:10:34,250 --> 03:10:34,810
100%.

4982
03:10:34,810 --> 03:10:36,430
Wait, who did Alan bet?

4983
03:10:36,710 --> 03:10:38,490
Did Alan bet for Jez or Space?

4984
03:10:39,430 --> 03:10:40,050
Let's check.

4985
03:10:40,050 --> 03:10:42,330
Well, I feel like hitting old right now and I don't necessarily know...

4986
03:10:42,330 --> 03:10:43,850
Okay, Alan voted for Space.

4987
03:10:44,270 --> 03:10:47,010
Trying to get some of this, you know, last final two or three seconds.

4988
03:10:47,150 --> 03:10:53,250
This rock hill, you can really hold on to and start to either pull away a lead or get back into the game on.

4989
03:10:53,410 --> 03:10:58,370
So, if I'm momentum right now, I would be fighting tooth and nail for this rock hill.

4990
03:10:58,370 --> 03:10:59,590
This is exactly what you like to do.

4991
03:10:59,790 --> 03:10:59,970
No!

4992
03:11:01,190 --> 03:11:01,630
Alan!

4993
03:11:02,110 --> 03:11:03,530
Swap your boat right now!

4994
03:11:04,190 --> 03:11:06,150
They're gonna lose their life savings!

4995
03:11:07,330 --> 03:11:07,810
Oh!

4996
03:11:08,510 --> 03:11:08,690
Oh!

4997
03:11:09,010 --> 03:11:10,430
That's Peyton Manning who lopped that.

4998
03:11:10,870 --> 03:11:12,050
Right in the pocket.

4999
03:11:12,090 --> 03:11:13,590
He's the reverse ball.

5000
03:11:14,230 --> 03:11:14,570
Yeah.

5001
03:11:16,210 --> 03:11:17,470
Oh, this course should lose one.

5002
03:11:17,590 --> 03:11:18,890
Oh, he sold the sword.

5003
03:11:19,010 --> 03:11:20,370
He's lopped the octopus.

5004
03:11:20,670 --> 03:11:21,350
Lopped the squid.

5005
03:11:21,770 --> 03:11:22,310
That's the thing.

5006
03:11:22,410 --> 03:11:25,390
You can get the specialist, but I don't know what you do with it.

5007
03:11:25,550 --> 03:11:26,030
Yeah, you got it.

5008
03:11:26,110 --> 03:11:26,970
Lopped the squid.

5009
03:11:27,950 --> 03:11:28,590
Good shots.

5010
03:11:29,370 --> 03:11:30,970
Jez, are you playing the front side?

5011
03:11:32,890 --> 03:11:34,950
At that point, you're just like, alright, whatever.

5012
03:11:35,250 --> 03:11:35,870
Here for the people for that one.

5013
03:11:35,950 --> 03:11:36,770
That's a good trade, though.

5014
03:11:36,930 --> 03:11:38,650
Like, I'll take myself out of it for me and Jez.

5015
03:11:38,810 --> 03:11:40,090
Jez also goes with me, bro.

5016
03:11:42,530 --> 03:11:44,270
It's been pretty mixy of a P4.

5017
03:11:45,390 --> 03:11:46,430
Oh, they took down space.

5018
03:11:47,050 --> 03:11:48,250
Oh, they took down space.

5019
03:11:48,770 --> 03:11:49,750
It's so close.

5020
03:11:50,250 --> 03:11:50,270
Jez did a great job.

5021
03:11:50,630 --> 03:11:51,710
Oh, my God, man.

5022
03:11:51,850 --> 03:11:53,730
He's applying so much pressure.

5023
03:11:54,050 --> 03:11:54,910
Can he keep going?

5024
03:11:55,290 --> 03:11:55,650
Yes!

5025
03:11:55,650 --> 03:11:57,330
Wait, he's out of killstreak.

5026
03:11:57,570 --> 03:11:58,270
Give him the streaks.

5027
03:11:58,490 --> 03:11:59,590
He gave him a streak.

5028
03:12:00,410 --> 03:12:00,770
Jez!

5029
03:12:00,770 --> 03:12:02,430
Absolutely slaying in this one.

5030
03:12:03,050 --> 03:12:04,170
Oh, my God.

5031
03:12:04,230 --> 03:12:05,350
Wait, he has to keep living.

5032
03:12:07,230 --> 03:12:11,550
I mean, Jez is, Jez is like, has the most kills currently.

5033
03:12:12,110 --> 03:12:13,310
That was a good reference, man.

5034
03:12:13,390 --> 03:12:14,030
He has takeover.

5035
03:12:14,030 --> 03:12:15,510
Someone locked in.

5036
03:12:16,050 --> 03:12:16,450
Space!

5037
03:12:16,910 --> 03:12:16,950
Space!

5038
03:12:18,370 --> 03:12:19,710
I need my VIP!

5039
03:12:21,270 --> 03:12:22,730
I need my VIP!

5040
03:12:23,090 --> 03:12:27,690
I think he's gonna hold on to that predator missile for when they need to open up one of these hills.

5041
03:12:27,870 --> 03:12:29,270
Probably P4 or P3.

5042
03:12:29,410 --> 03:12:30,730
That's, you know, way more wide open.

5043
03:12:30,750 --> 03:12:31,430
Oh, he's throwing two aggressive on that?

5044
03:12:31,550 --> 03:12:31,750
Yeah.

5045
03:12:32,170 --> 03:12:32,290
Yeah.

5046
03:12:32,570 --> 03:12:33,530
That's a good trade.

5047
03:12:35,350 --> 03:12:36,910
Not gonna lie, Jez has been performing.

5048
03:12:37,050 --> 03:12:37,710
Oh, my gosh.

5049
03:12:38,430 --> 03:12:38,570
Oh.

5050
03:12:39,190 --> 03:12:40,310
There they go, that war machine.

5051
03:12:40,650 --> 03:12:40,790
Yo!

5052
03:12:41,150 --> 03:12:41,990
That's what I'm picking up.

5053
03:12:42,230 --> 03:12:42,450
Yup.

5054
03:12:43,470 --> 03:12:44,850
I'm so anxious.

5055
03:12:46,170 --> 03:12:47,930
I thought about that first hard point.

5056
03:12:48,730 --> 03:12:51,310
Alan, didn't you vote for Jez at first?

5057
03:12:51,310 --> 03:12:52,530
For the first round?

5058
03:12:53,070 --> 03:12:53,850
What happened?

5059
03:12:54,390 --> 03:12:56,290
Oh, now you say kills don't matter?

5060
03:12:56,710 --> 03:12:58,810
Weren't you a Jez, Jez lever?

5061
03:13:06,390 --> 03:13:06,950
Hey,

5062
03:13:11,510 --> 03:13:12,870
maybe space will win, guys.

5063
03:13:13,350 --> 03:13:14,750
Game for them, not too crazy.

5064
03:13:17,930 --> 03:13:19,110
No, I'd be trying to hold the angle.

5065
03:13:19,290 --> 03:13:19,830
No, he's shot.

5066
03:13:20,530 --> 03:13:22,770
Yes, maybe space will win this.

5067
03:13:23,490 --> 03:13:24,350
Space, so composed.

5068
03:13:24,490 --> 03:13:25,590
Let's see if you can hold it down.

5069
03:13:26,130 --> 03:13:26,250
One.

5070
03:13:26,410 --> 03:13:27,130
There's the laser.

5071
03:13:27,570 --> 03:13:29,550
What the heck is that gun?

5072
03:13:29,770 --> 03:13:30,870
Wait, that's cheating!

5073
03:13:32,150 --> 03:13:35,230
Aiden's war machine finally finding some kills there.

5074
03:13:35,370 --> 03:13:35,610
What?

5075
03:13:36,090 --> 03:13:37,350
Does he have like a spear?

5076
03:13:37,610 --> 03:13:38,730
What is he holding?

5077
03:13:39,990 --> 03:13:42,030
Oh, that's a kill streak gun?

5078
03:13:42,510 --> 03:13:43,670
Oh, my God.

5079
03:13:44,490 --> 03:13:45,410
Ready to clean it up.

5080
03:13:45,990 --> 03:13:46,610
That's huge.

5081
03:13:46,610 --> 03:13:48,850
I was like, what is he holding?

5082
03:13:49,850 --> 03:13:53,370
Honestly, I feel like they were afraid to answer because space had...

5083
03:13:53,370 --> 03:13:53,570
Yeah!

5084
03:13:53,930 --> 03:13:56,910
I was like, bro, that guy brought a gun from the future!

5085
03:13:58,210 --> 03:13:59,450
How is that fair?

5086
03:13:59,850 --> 03:14:01,130
Someone told me he had the Tempest.

5087
03:14:01,250 --> 03:14:02,190
I'm waiting outside.

5088
03:14:03,170 --> 03:14:03,910
40 point lead?

5089
03:14:04,050 --> 03:14:08,010
Yeah, but remember who else had a 40 point lead before they lost?

5090
03:14:08,650 --> 03:14:11,310
Super good job of really just kind of creating that lead.

5091
03:14:11,450 --> 03:14:13,950
You're putting a lot of pressure on momentum right now.

5092
03:14:14,210 --> 03:14:15,690
I mean, if they play this good, they play this good.

5093
03:14:15,690 --> 03:14:16,730
Fuck you, Alan.

5094
03:14:16,990 --> 03:14:19,150
I've been against you and I'm gonna lose!

5095
03:14:23,190 --> 03:14:24,370
Yeah, momentum.

5096
03:14:25,270 --> 03:14:28,730
Down 50 in this one so far, but they do have control of the hill.

5097
03:14:28,890 --> 03:14:29,350
He's just...

5098
03:14:29,350 --> 03:14:31,510
Everyone's just like, let's see where Alan voted.

5099
03:14:31,730 --> 03:14:33,810
And then make sure to vote against him.

5100
03:14:34,570 --> 03:14:35,270
Oh, but...

5101
03:14:35,270 --> 03:14:35,850
But...

5102
03:14:35,850 --> 03:14:37,930
Jez does have the point right now.

5103
03:14:40,350 --> 03:14:43,970
Oh, no, he has...

5104
03:14:43,970 --> 03:14:45,010
Oh, it's the kill streak!

5105
03:14:45,190 --> 03:14:45,390
Oh!

5106
03:14:45,670 --> 03:14:46,570
Wait, who did he kill?

5107
03:14:47,830 --> 03:14:48,590
Okay, it's okay.

5108
03:14:48,710 --> 03:14:49,590
Jez is still alive.

5109
03:14:52,610 --> 03:14:53,570
Oh, never mind.

5110
03:14:54,190 --> 03:14:54,530
Wait, no.

5111
03:14:54,570 --> 03:14:55,370
Jez is still alive.

5112
03:14:58,710 --> 03:14:59,410
Where's the point?

5113
03:15:00,890 --> 03:15:01,290
Oh...

5114
03:15:03,810 --> 03:15:07,150
Looks like there's one player from momentum that has made some sort of read.

5115
03:15:07,370 --> 03:15:07,710
So you're gonna get some...

5116
03:15:07,710 --> 03:15:08,030
He's dead.

5117
03:15:08,790 --> 03:15:10,190
Never mind, he's dead.

5118
03:15:10,570 --> 03:15:12,370
And get ready to pop in the next couple of seconds.

5119
03:15:12,570 --> 03:15:13,470
So you're able to set yourself on...

5120
03:15:13,470 --> 03:15:14,770
And it's a 60-point lead.

5121
03:15:15,170 --> 03:15:15,730
Our momentum.

5122
03:15:15,950 --> 03:15:17,270
But we saw this last time around.

5123
03:15:18,090 --> 03:15:19,970
Maybe the Knights did a great job breaking it off.

5124
03:15:20,170 --> 03:15:22,850
Toki, you gave me false information.

5125
03:15:24,190 --> 03:15:26,430
The house always wins in the end.

5126
03:15:27,550 --> 03:15:28,050
Still though.

5127
03:15:28,170 --> 03:15:28,910
60 points.

5128
03:15:29,430 --> 03:15:30,330
You literally have to play.

5129
03:15:30,710 --> 03:15:31,150
Perfect.

5130
03:15:31,350 --> 03:15:32,050
You pulled it out.

5131
03:15:33,130 --> 03:15:36,330
I was a coward and I will be rewarded.

5132
03:15:40,530 --> 03:15:43,270
Jez, are you really gonna let the cowards win?

5133
03:15:44,350 --> 03:15:44,790
Dev.

5134
03:15:46,290 --> 03:15:49,590
And if your momentum right now, this is the last thing you wanna see.

5135
03:15:50,470 --> 03:15:52,750
Nebula Knights has the ability to run away with it here.

5136
03:15:52,890 --> 03:15:53,970
30 seconds left on the hill.

5137
03:15:54,110 --> 03:15:55,350
They need to break it.

5138
03:15:55,570 --> 03:15:56,910
At least you need to at least protest it.

5139
03:15:56,910 --> 03:15:58,850
Oh, it doesn't look so good.

5140
03:15:58,970 --> 03:16:00,970
They're just being mowed down right now.

5141
03:16:01,210 --> 03:16:05,670
They're being mowed down over and over and over again.

5142
03:16:06,230 --> 03:16:07,410
Continuing to slide around.

5143
03:16:10,050 --> 03:16:11,730
they're feeling good all day long.

5144
03:16:11,830 --> 03:16:13,370
They're just trickling in.

5145
03:16:13,690 --> 03:16:15,090
They're just trickling in.

5146
03:16:15,270 --> 03:16:16,050
Yeah, walking in the shots.

5147
03:16:16,270 --> 03:16:17,530
Yeah good shots there from Santana.

5148
03:16:17,630 --> 03:16:20,210
What the world is for the cowards?

5149
03:16:20,950 --> 03:16:22,590
Who is the one that...

5150
03:16:22,590 --> 03:16:23,570
Who was the one?

5151
03:16:23,770 --> 03:16:25,350
That was mad at the cowards?

5152
03:16:25,430 --> 03:16:26,110
Who was it?

5153
03:16:26,470 --> 03:16:27,990
That was yelling at them.

5154
03:16:30,150 --> 03:16:31,750
Who did you vote for?

5155
03:16:32,810 --> 03:16:37,170
It was me, and he voted for Jez!

5156
03:16:41,210 --> 03:16:44,830
The angry man voted for Jez, too.

5157
03:16:53,350 --> 03:16:56,030
Yeah, let's go take a look at his S25.

5158
03:16:56,970 --> 03:16:57,650
Expeditiously.

5159
03:16:57,770 --> 03:16:57,970
Here we go.

5160
03:16:58,410 --> 03:16:59,470
Flank here from space.

5161
03:17:00,110 --> 03:17:01,870
I take you with honor!

5162
03:17:03,730 --> 03:17:08,970
So, in that situation, why not just chill in the balcony with your Tempest and gun him down?

5163
03:17:09,430 --> 03:17:16,830
He's probably just trying to create space for his team, because at least if he can get a couple of kills off the hill, really get them out, you can let the rest of his teammate flood in.

5164
03:17:16,950 --> 03:17:20,870
Guys, I don't think they're going to get the points back, guys.

5165
03:17:21,310 --> 03:17:22,290
I don't!

5166
03:17:22,290 --> 03:17:23,630
As soon as I have a Tempest and I want kills.

5167
03:17:25,570 --> 03:17:26,470
He's playing aggressive.

5168
03:17:26,590 --> 03:17:27,050
I want to use this before it runs out.

5169
03:17:27,470 --> 03:17:29,250
Definitely a valid thing to try and do.

5170
03:17:29,450 --> 03:17:30,110
Okay, here we go.

5171
03:17:30,570 --> 03:17:32,030
Yep, this hill is very, very important.

5172
03:17:32,210 --> 03:17:34,070
Momentum needs...

5173
03:17:34,510 --> 03:17:35,070
Here we go.

5174
03:17:35,170 --> 03:17:38,790
They do have control of it so far here.

5175
03:17:38,790 --> 03:17:43,090
He has the grenade launcher, but he needs to know where they are.

5176
03:17:44,250 --> 03:17:46,410
They need as many points as they can get.

5177
03:17:46,570 --> 03:17:46,690
Oh!

5178
03:17:47,390 --> 03:17:49,770
Okay, so getting all of these kills is so much right now.

5179
03:17:49,770 --> 03:17:51,590
He needs those kills as much as he can.

5180
03:17:51,870 --> 03:17:52,490
One in the back.

5181
03:17:52,930 --> 03:17:53,930
Hunter killer's there.

5182
03:17:54,570 --> 03:17:55,590
He's still alive.

5183
03:17:55,750 --> 03:17:56,470
He's still alive.

5184
03:17:56,690 --> 03:17:57,030
He's healing.

5185
03:17:57,210 --> 03:17:57,850
He's operating.

5186
03:17:58,190 --> 03:17:58,670
I... Oh!

5187
03:17:59,730 --> 03:18:00,510
Two piece.

5188
03:18:00,670 --> 03:18:01,530
Nope, just hit one.

5189
03:18:02,010 --> 03:18:02,590
The spawn protection.

5190
03:18:03,390 --> 03:18:03,390
How?

5191
03:18:03,530 --> 03:18:06,290
Can his team, like, guard in time?

5192
03:18:06,810 --> 03:18:07,910
Death machine online.

5193
03:18:10,210 --> 03:18:10,930
Okay, momentum.

5194
03:18:12,270 --> 03:18:12,950
Yeah, this is exactly what he's doing here.

5195
03:18:12,950 --> 03:18:15,410
His team needs to be able to guard... guard in time.

5196
03:18:16,150 --> 03:18:17,090
While he's out.

5197
03:18:17,370 --> 03:18:18,870
They have control of this hill and...

5198
03:18:18,870 --> 03:18:22,730
They have made an unrealistic comeback look a lot more realistic.

5199
03:18:27,440 --> 03:18:29,140
Wow, they did everything they needed to.

5200
03:18:29,140 --> 03:18:31,060
Oh no, he got Husker!

5201
03:18:31,380 --> 03:18:31,460
Yep.

5202
03:18:33,440 --> 03:18:34,020
Turn around!

5203
03:18:34,740 --> 03:18:35,320
Turn around!

5204
03:18:37,280 --> 03:18:37,780
Turn around!

5205
03:18:37,940 --> 03:18:38,580
Turn around!

5206
03:18:38,580 --> 03:18:38,860
Turn around!

5207
03:18:38,860 --> 03:18:38,880
Turn around!

5208
03:18:38,880 --> 03:18:39,000
Turn around!

5209
03:18:40,580 --> 03:18:41,980
Cut them on down.

5210
03:18:42,140 --> 03:18:43,660
They're not expecting you to be on over here.

5211
03:18:43,960 --> 03:18:45,420
Oh, 175.

5212
03:18:46,400 --> 03:18:46,500
Oh.

5213
03:18:47,780 --> 03:18:50,000
Space just needs 30 points, guys.

5214
03:18:50,360 --> 03:18:51,040
Anybody there?

5215
03:18:51,280 --> 03:18:52,120
Space has a...

5216
03:18:52,120 --> 03:18:53,320
Temptions in his back pocket.

5217
03:18:53,460 --> 03:18:54,940
Just 30 points.

5218
03:18:55,120 --> 03:18:56,180
Space got a kill though!

5219
03:18:56,360 --> 03:18:57,100
Space got two!

5220
03:18:59,020 --> 03:18:59,460
Oh!

5221
03:19:01,300 --> 03:19:01,540
Oh!

5222
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:01,600
Oh!

5223
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:01,720
Oh!

5224
03:19:01,720 --> 03:19:02,840
They could close out here.

5225
03:19:03,060 --> 03:19:04,060
They could.

5226
03:19:04,480 --> 03:19:05,140
They could!

5227
03:19:05,560 --> 03:19:05,620
20!

5228
03:19:06,220 --> 03:19:06,660
20!

5229
03:19:07,260 --> 03:19:09,200
Already, you can see the members of...

5230
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:11,280
Momentum, they're spawning in the back.

5231
03:19:11,940 --> 03:19:12,380
Sandwich.

5232
03:19:12,680 --> 03:19:13,440
The last final...

5233
03:19:13,440 --> 03:19:13,660
Oh!

5234
03:19:13,760 --> 03:19:14,480
They got the point back!

5235
03:19:14,540 --> 03:19:15,020
They got it back!

5236
03:19:15,880 --> 03:19:18,260
Everybody's still just trying to run at this hill.

5237
03:19:19,900 --> 03:19:20,340
Still...

5238
03:19:20,340 --> 03:19:22,800
He has to be able to control this for...

5239
03:19:22,800 --> 03:19:23,800
Oh my god.

5240
03:19:23,960 --> 03:19:24,680
Oh, it's tight.

5241
03:19:25,040 --> 03:19:25,620
They're on the hill.

5242
03:19:25,620 --> 03:19:26,800
Wait, but space is...

5243
03:19:27,420 --> 03:19:27,760
35!

5244
03:19:28,020 --> 03:19:28,500
35!

5245
03:19:29,520 --> 03:19:30,000
36!

5246
03:19:30,500 --> 03:19:30,620
Oh!

5247
03:19:31,860 --> 03:19:33,260
No, it's gonna take another hill.

5248
03:19:34,600 --> 03:19:35,720
Yup, not just yet.

5249
03:19:36,440 --> 03:19:37,200
Great contest.

5250
03:19:37,720 --> 03:19:38,240
It's to P4.

5251
03:19:38,500 --> 03:19:39,640
They're still contesting.

5252
03:19:40,200 --> 03:19:40,800
It's the rock hill.

5253
03:19:40,960 --> 03:19:42,680
They've been so good at it throughout this entire...

5254
03:19:42,680 --> 03:19:44,160
They're still contesting.

5255
03:19:44,340 --> 03:19:45,300
Jez is still...

5256
03:19:45,300 --> 03:19:45,400
Oh!

5257
03:19:46,700 --> 03:19:47,340
37!

5258
03:19:47,960 --> 03:19:48,600
38!

5259
03:19:49,280 --> 03:19:49,900
39!

5260
03:19:51,220 --> 03:19:52,980
It's at 39!

5261
03:19:53,620 --> 03:19:55,620
He needs 11 points!

5262
03:19:56,300 --> 03:19:57,260
Cowards win!

5263
03:19:57,640 --> 03:19:58,420
Cowards win!

5264
03:19:59,260 --> 03:19:59,900
Cowards win!

5265
03:20:03,860 --> 03:20:04,620
Already lucky!

5266
03:20:05,340 --> 03:20:05,980
Holding this one on in!

5267
03:20:05,980 --> 03:20:07,840
Should've been a coward, guys!

5268
03:20:08,180 --> 03:20:09,860
Should've been a coward!

5269
03:20:10,420 --> 03:20:11,640
They do it!

5270
03:20:11,820 --> 03:20:12,740
They break the hill!

5271
03:20:13,900 --> 03:20:14,120
They have it!

5272
03:20:14,120 --> 03:20:15,280
You're still getting close spots now!

5273
03:20:15,280 --> 03:20:15,380
Oh, this is a shot!

5274
03:20:16,040 --> 03:20:17,640
That was a huge pitch by Santana.

5275
03:20:18,620 --> 03:20:23,260
And if they could do what they did earlier all over again, and milk this hill for all this time...

5276
03:20:23,260 --> 03:20:23,800
They are...

5277
03:20:23,800 --> 03:20:24,560
I milked the hill!

5278
03:20:24,800 --> 03:20:25,540
Oh, Jez is down!

5279
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:26,160
Jez is down!

5280
03:20:26,300 --> 03:20:26,620
It's over!

5281
03:20:27,280 --> 03:20:27,500
Guys!

5282
03:20:27,820 --> 03:20:28,640
Jez is down!

5283
03:20:29,740 --> 03:20:29,860
Oh!

5284
03:20:30,480 --> 03:20:30,940
Three!

5285
03:20:31,660 --> 03:20:32,120
42!

5286
03:20:33,020 --> 03:20:33,480
43!

5287
03:20:34,260 --> 03:20:34,720
44!

5288
03:20:35,460 --> 03:20:35,920
45!

5289
03:20:36,760 --> 03:20:37,220
46!

5290
03:20:38,720 --> 03:20:39,520
The shots are there!

5291
03:20:39,680 --> 03:20:40,900
Do they line on up for you?

5292
03:20:41,180 --> 03:20:41,640
46!

5293
03:20:42,960 --> 03:20:43,420
Wow!

5294
03:20:44,980 --> 03:20:45,100
Oh, but the whole team...

5295
03:20:45,100 --> 03:20:45,780
You're still close!

5296
03:20:45,880 --> 03:20:46,640
Oh!

5297
03:20:46,840 --> 03:20:47,460
Jez is down!

5298
03:20:47,660 --> 03:20:47,980
It's over!

5299
03:20:48,320 --> 03:20:49,060
Jez is down!

5300
03:20:49,400 --> 03:20:49,880
Wait!

5301
03:20:49,980 --> 03:20:50,560
But he got...

5302
03:20:50,560 --> 03:20:51,300
They got space!

5303
03:20:52,920 --> 03:20:53,680
49!

5304
03:20:54,260 --> 03:20:55,020
50!

5305
03:20:55,560 --> 03:20:56,480
They've seen that!

5306
03:20:57,640 --> 03:20:58,820
They've seen that!

5307
03:20:59,160 --> 03:20:59,280
Wow!

5308
03:20:59,900 --> 03:21:01,260
They've seen that!

5309
03:21:01,860 --> 03:21:02,040
That was good!

5310
03:21:02,420 --> 03:21:02,540
That was good!

5311
03:21:02,540 --> 03:21:04,480
That was good!

5312
03:21:05,020 --> 03:21:06,200
Oh my god!

5313
03:21:06,920 --> 03:21:07,880
They got up!

5314
03:21:08,060 --> 03:21:08,440
40!

5315
03:21:09,560 --> 03:21:11,560
I'm not lost anymore!

5316
03:21:12,520 --> 03:21:13,340
I'm not!

5317
03:21:13,340 --> 03:21:13,860
What?!

5318
03:21:13,860 --> 03:21:14,440
That's close!

5319
03:21:14,520 --> 03:21:14,820
Yo!

5320
03:21:15,140 --> 03:21:16,680
It's rule of the world!

5321
03:21:17,020 --> 03:21:18,520
Put the team on it's back, man!

5322
03:21:18,680 --> 03:21:18,860
Congratulations!

5323
03:21:18,860 --> 03:21:22,600
It looks like space one in the end!

5324
03:21:23,360 --> 03:21:23,500
Look at them!

5325
03:21:23,800 --> 03:21:24,220
They're stoked!

5326
03:21:24,440 --> 03:21:24,880
They're excited!

5327
03:21:25,540 --> 03:21:26,500
They're working together!

5328
03:21:26,900 --> 03:21:27,940
Give me that!

5329
03:21:28,400 --> 03:21:30,960
I'm a coward, but I'm rich!

5330
03:21:37,700 --> 03:21:39,800
Oh my god!

5331
03:21:40,020 --> 03:21:41,700
Not washed no more!

5332
03:21:42,540 --> 03:21:44,440
He never took a bath!

5333
03:21:46,520 --> 03:21:48,280
Look at that!

5334
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:50,840
801k!

5335
03:21:50,840 --> 03:21:51,180
Definitely!

5336
03:21:51,460 --> 03:21:53,040
Definitely a hard fought win!

5337
03:21:53,260 --> 03:21:53,560
3-1!

5338
03:21:53,740 --> 03:21:54,300
You have called me good!

5339
03:21:54,400 --> 03:21:54,620
Jesus!

5340
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:55,960
Look at him go!

5341
03:21:56,520 --> 03:21:56,920
On the!

5342
03:21:57,420 --> 03:21:58,060
Exclamation point!

5343
03:21:58,220 --> 03:21:58,700
Samsung!

5344
03:22:00,360 --> 03:22:02,840
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra!

5345
03:22:04,760 --> 03:22:05,980
That was a good game!

5346
03:22:06,260 --> 03:22:07,400
That was a natural good game!

5347
03:22:08,120 --> 03:22:08,340
Wow!

5348
03:22:08,540 --> 03:22:09,840
Congratulations to Nebula Knights!

5349
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:11,940
I always trusted in space!

5350
03:22:12,660 --> 03:22:13,060
Many!

5351
03:22:13,220 --> 03:22:14,160
Thank you for this super chat!

5352
03:22:14,460 --> 03:22:15,220
Uh, think of- Not super chat!

5353
03:22:15,640 --> 03:22:17,160
Thank you for the 250s!

5354
03:22:17,260 --> 03:22:17,500
Thank you!

5355
03:22:17,640 --> 03:22:18,020
Thank you!

5356
03:22:18,380 --> 03:22:19,820
At least with my current phone!

5357
03:22:19,940 --> 03:22:22,600
I can't see my losses as clearly as I would have!

5358
03:22:22,840 --> 03:22:24,980
With this Samsung S25!

5359
03:22:29,900 --> 03:22:30,300
Alright!

5360
03:22:30,580 --> 03:22:30,680
Wait!

5361
03:22:30,860 --> 03:22:32,580
Who has 100% prediction rate?

5362
03:22:32,780 --> 03:22:32,960
Guys!

5363
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:33,500
Who at?

5364
03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:33,980
Got it!

5365
03:22:34,420 --> 03:22:34,680
Alright!

5366
03:22:34,780 --> 03:22:36,420
Let me make this!

5367
03:22:37,440 --> 03:22:40,900
I don't know if- Let me see if anybody actually has enough for this!

5368
03:22:41,300 --> 03:22:42,580
I'm actually curious!

5369
03:22:43,680 --> 03:22:45,220
What a match though!

5370
03:22:45,480 --> 03:22:45,780
Geez!

5371
03:22:46,960 --> 03:22:48,440
That was an intense game!

5372
03:22:50,760 --> 03:22:52,500
What an intense match!

5373
03:22:53,720 --> 03:22:54,280
Alright!

5374
03:22:54,280 --> 03:22:54,800
Let's see!

5375
03:22:54,940 --> 03:22:56,380
Power up and channel points!

5376
03:22:56,680 --> 03:22:57,060
Uh...

5377
03:22:57,060 --> 03:22:57,680
Is it rewards?

5378
03:22:57,880 --> 03:22:58,960
Oh, it is rewards, right?

5379
03:22:59,020 --> 03:22:59,200
No!

5380
03:22:59,580 --> 03:23:01,040
It's power up and channel points!

5381
03:23:01,280 --> 03:23:01,400
Okay!

5382
03:23:01,480 --> 03:23:01,800
Enable!

5383
03:23:03,400 --> 03:23:03,960
Customize!

5384
03:23:04,440 --> 03:23:05,000
Enable!

5385
03:23:05,420 --> 03:23:05,840
Alright!

5386
03:23:06,260 --> 03:23:07,120
Let's see!

5387
03:23:07,180 --> 03:23:07,960
Where is it?

5388
03:23:08,320 --> 03:23:09,320
Uh...

5389
03:23:10,020 --> 03:23:12,440
Add a new custom reward!

5390
03:23:12,980 --> 03:23:14,940
Get VIP!

5391
03:23:15,420 --> 03:23:19,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

5392
03:23:20,440 --> 03:23:21,400
Somebody needs a blazer!

5393
03:23:21,500 --> 03:23:21,820
Alright!

5394
03:23:22,080 --> 03:23:22,460
Let's see!

5395
03:23:24,280 --> 03:23:24,380
Yeah!

5396
03:23:24,660 --> 03:23:25,660
He still has an opportunity!

5397
03:23:25,840 --> 03:23:26,240
Yeah!

5398
03:23:26,960 --> 03:23:27,400
VIP!

5399
03:23:28,380 --> 03:23:29,760
We could come back in our show match!

5400
03:23:29,900 --> 03:23:30,500
You could still walk away!

5401
03:23:30,500 --> 03:23:32,160
Let's see if anybody has enough for this!

5402
03:23:32,360 --> 03:23:33,260
After all the prediction!

5403
03:23:33,460 --> 03:23:34,800
Let's see the people who got...

5404
03:23:34,800 --> 03:23:36,060
4 out of 4!

5405
03:23:36,060 --> 03:23:39,120
Socks, thank you for the 1,000 bitties.

5406
03:23:39,360 --> 03:23:39,960
Thank you, thank you.

5407
03:23:40,120 --> 03:23:42,080
Space is the GOAT.

5408
03:23:42,860 --> 03:23:43,000
Alright.

5409
03:23:43,640 --> 03:23:47,300
How do I... okay, redemption, cooldown limits.

5410
03:23:48,060 --> 03:23:50,500
Limit redemption, one.

5411
03:23:51,860 --> 03:23:53,400
One, alright.

5412
03:23:53,880 --> 03:23:56,480
There's only one redemption for this.

5413
03:23:57,700 --> 03:24:02,060
But let's see if anybody... for space...

5414
03:24:05,680 --> 03:24:10,760
Always believed in... always believe in the underdog.

5415
03:24:11,360 --> 03:24:12,000
Space!

5416
03:24:16,860 --> 03:24:21,140
Alright, I'm curious, because I know some people won 100k, so let's see...

5417
03:24:22,300 --> 03:24:26,840
Let's see how many people... how many actually... let's see if anybody can afford this.

5418
03:24:27,420 --> 03:24:28,800
Alright, it's on.

5419
03:24:29,580 --> 03:24:31,240
Can anyone afford this?

5420
03:24:31,240 --> 03:24:34,720
That Mr. Bass from the past is live on the stage right now.

5421
03:24:34,860 --> 03:24:36,260
Ready to interview our win...

5422
03:24:36,260 --> 03:24:37,260
No way!

5423
03:24:38,580 --> 03:24:40,400
Fire... I'm curious.

5424
03:24:41,740 --> 03:24:46,120
Alright, we've got our winning team one more time.

5425
03:24:46,300 --> 03:24:48,760
Give it up for the Nebula Knights!

5426
03:24:49,980 --> 03:24:52,960
Too rich for my blood.

5427
03:24:53,880 --> 03:25:00,960
There has to be one... one of you guys must... must have... must be able to afford it, right?

5428
03:25:00,960 --> 03:25:02,560
Congratulations one more time!

5429
03:25:02,560 --> 03:25:06,020
Surely, one of you guys could afford it!

5430
03:25:09,890 --> 03:25:12,910
We're all... we've bet it all on Jez!

5431
03:25:13,910 --> 03:25:16,430
I've bet it all on Jez!

5432
03:25:16,550 --> 03:25:18,150
I don't have enough!

5433
03:25:24,850 --> 03:25:29,770
Alright, alright, since we don't... I lost everything!

5434
03:25:30,070 --> 03:25:33,870
One more time, you're winners of the Samsung Galaxy Gear Up Cup!

5435
03:25:33,890 --> 03:25:34,510
Yay!

5436
03:25:35,950 --> 03:25:37,790
Alright, I'm lowering it.

5437
03:25:38,310 --> 03:25:39,390
I have lowered it.

5438
03:25:42,330 --> 03:25:42,870
Surely!

5439
03:25:45,270 --> 03:25:45,810
Surely!

5440
03:25:45,810 --> 03:25:45,970
Surely!

5441
03:25:46,230 --> 03:25:46,330
Surely!

5442
03:25:46,450 --> 03:25:46,590
Someone!

5443
03:25:47,230 --> 03:25:47,770
Could've...

5444
03:25:50,670 --> 03:25:51,670
I believe!

5445
03:25:55,750 --> 03:25:56,290
Surely!

5446
03:25:56,590 --> 03:25:58,470
You guys want enough predictions for it!

5447
03:25:58,790 --> 03:25:59,070
My guy!

5448
03:25:59,250 --> 03:26:00,230
Do you mind stepping over here?

5449
03:26:00,350 --> 03:26:01,070
We gotta talk!

5450
03:26:01,930 --> 03:26:03,570
Raise it instead!

5451
03:26:03,570 --> 03:26:06,730
There's only one redemption for it!

5452
03:26:06,930 --> 03:26:08,510
First off, a massive congratulations!

5453
03:26:09,090 --> 03:26:11,950
You drafted a team that has not only taken this entire thing home!

5454
03:26:12,490 --> 03:26:13,010
You guys did...

5455
03:26:13,010 --> 03:26:13,750
Space was...

5456
03:26:13,750 --> 03:26:15,490
Wait, Space was the vibes guy!

5457
03:26:15,850 --> 03:26:17,270
He also did vibes!

5458
03:26:17,610 --> 03:26:20,290
A 3-2-1 in the brands!

5459
03:26:20,790 --> 03:26:21,570
That guy...

5460
03:26:21,570 --> 03:26:22,410
I remembered!

5461
03:26:22,650 --> 03:26:24,310
He spaced it off of vibes!

5462
03:26:24,310 --> 03:26:24,670
It was vibes!

5463
03:26:24,670 --> 03:26:25,570
It's all team work!

5464
03:26:25,830 --> 03:26:26,510
And I mean...

5465
03:26:26,510 --> 03:26:27,970
If you look to the draft...

5466
03:26:27,970 --> 03:26:29,530
It was vibes to the end!

5467
03:26:29,690 --> 03:26:30,170
It was the worst team!

5468
03:26:30,490 --> 03:26:31,190
But they had no clue!

5469
03:26:31,370 --> 03:26:33,210
They absolutely had no clue what was in store!

5470
03:26:33,290 --> 03:26:34,070
My team showed up.

5471
03:26:34,130 --> 03:26:34,710
They were practicing!

5472
03:26:34,730 --> 03:26:35,330
They were ready!

5473
03:26:35,530 --> 03:26:37,210
And that's just what's gonna take the game!

5474
03:26:37,950 --> 03:26:39,530
Alright, I'll do one more!

5475
03:26:40,290 --> 03:26:41,470
I'll do one more!

5476
03:26:43,270 --> 03:26:45,370
Cause I saw someone said...

5477
03:26:45,370 --> 03:26:47,310
They have 250k...

5478
03:26:48,290 --> 03:26:50,310
So I put it at 260k...

5479
03:26:50,310 --> 03:26:50,890
CK.

5480
03:27:03,010 --> 03:27:05,130
That's crazy!

5481
03:27:06,790 --> 03:27:10,030
The last one.

5482
03:27:10,270 --> 03:27:11,650
You monster!

5483
03:27:14,170 --> 03:27:17,090
Clearly someone can redeem this one.

5484
03:27:24,630 --> 03:27:28,790
Screw that one... one Dragoon in particular.

5485
03:27:32,390 --> 03:27:33,430
Surely, right?

5486
03:27:34,190 --> 03:27:35,930
You know what?

5487
03:27:37,810 --> 03:27:40,490
Also, congratulations to space!

5488
03:27:40,950 --> 03:27:42,430
Oh, that's a nice metal, by the way.

5489
03:27:42,870 --> 03:27:44,910
That metal looks pretty sick.

5490
03:27:45,710 --> 03:27:46,810
All right, guys.

5491
03:27:47,650 --> 03:27:48,730
You're a monster.

5492
03:27:48,790 --> 03:27:49,050
All right.

5493
03:27:49,050 --> 03:27:53,210
I'll give you... I'll give him one chance to make enough, guys.

5494
03:27:54,450 --> 03:27:59,050
I'll give you guys one chance to make enough to be able to afford it.

5495
03:28:00,110 --> 03:28:01,650
Heads or tails.

5496
03:28:06,530 --> 03:28:11,210
He might win it all or lose it.

5497
03:28:12,270 --> 03:28:15,750
He could win it all or lose it right here.

5498
03:28:17,150 --> 03:28:18,690
Heads or tails.

5499
03:28:19,130 --> 03:28:21,270
You could be able to afford it here.

5500
03:28:22,070 --> 03:28:23,590
Yeah, that's the best.

5501
03:28:23,770 --> 03:28:29,910
Hi, my name is Space, and today I'm going to be giving y'all some COD mobile tips and tricks specifically about the importance of scorestreaks.

5502
03:28:30,110 --> 03:28:34,490
When competing at any level, scorestreaks can literally be the difference between winning and losing a game.

5503
03:28:34,670 --> 03:28:39,650
Scorestreaks are also known to have a huge snowballing effect when used correctly, so let's go ahead and look at some of the specifics.

5504
03:28:40,210 --> 03:28:41,350
There's only three main scorestreaks.

5505
03:28:41,350 --> 03:28:42,850
Don't worry, I got the coinflip right here.

5506
03:28:43,030 --> 03:28:44,670
The Pred Missile and the EMP system.

5507
03:28:44,950 --> 03:28:52,950
These scorestreaks were specifically chosen for comp because they're known to not have that big of a snowball effect, but there's still a few key tips and tricks that y'all should consider when using them.

5508
03:28:53,070 --> 03:28:57,070
With the Pred Missile, a lot of people will literally just spam their screen as fast as they can until it lands.

5509
03:28:57,170 --> 03:28:57,890
That's true, though.

5510
03:28:57,950 --> 03:28:59,150
He was really good with his...

5511
03:28:59,150 --> 03:29:01,950
He was really good with his, like, killstreak weapons.

5512
03:29:01,950 --> 03:29:10,150
What players do is whenever they use a Pred Missile, they'll let it fall extremely slow, and instead of mashing the screen trying to get a kill, they'll actually call out where all the enemies are.

5513
03:29:10,170 --> 03:29:10,370
Don't do it.

5514
03:29:11,130 --> 03:29:11,370
Alright.

5515
03:29:13,050 --> 03:29:13,450
Alright.

5516
03:29:14,130 --> 03:29:14,270
Alright.

5517
03:29:14,270 --> 03:29:15,550
I'm flipping the coin.

5518
03:29:15,990 --> 03:29:20,350
The EMP system, it's best to talk to your teammates and use it in tandem with their operator skills.

5519
03:29:20,570 --> 03:29:22,830
The EMP systems actually destroy all trophy systems.

5520
03:29:23,030 --> 03:29:31,270
So if you have a teammate with a war machine or a skill, have them tell you when it's ready, and then pop the EMP as soon as they pop their operator skills, and that'll ensure that they don't have to worry about a single trophy system.

5521
03:29:31,270 --> 03:29:35,090
The ranked, on the other hand, there is absolutely zero restriction on what scorestreaks you can use.

5522
03:29:35,250 --> 03:29:40,550
Me, personally, I like to get a lot of kills in my game, so I choose to use non-ranked scorestreaks that are mainly informative.

5523
03:29:40,770 --> 03:29:44,210
My scorestreaks of choice are the UAV, the Shock RC, and the Advanced UAV.

5524
03:29:44,310 --> 03:29:51,230
If you go on the street high enough to get an Advanced UAV, it basically gives you mathpacks showing exactly where every single enemy is on the other team.

5525
03:29:51,310 --> 03:29:52,170
No, you didn't!

5526
03:29:52,430 --> 03:29:53,190
He picked Tails!

5527
03:29:54,150 --> 03:29:55,230
He picked Tails!

5528
03:29:55,250 --> 03:30:02,550
But if we're getting serious, and you're actually trying to win some ranked games, I would highly recommend you all use the UAV, the Dragonfire Drone and the Goliath.

5529
03:30:02,630 --> 03:30:09,030
These three scorestreaks just work so well together, you use your UAV to get some information, and with that information you get the Dragonfire Drone.

5530
03:30:09,050 --> 03:30:13,670
Once you use the Dragonfire Drone, have your teammates protect you, and shoot your bullets to tag the enemies on the map.

5531
03:30:13,970 --> 03:30:20,190
Now you can see the enemies through the world, and with the case that you get from having these wall hacks, you'll be able to get your Goliath.

5532
03:30:20,190 --> 03:30:24,030
These are literally the cheapest, easiest, and most effective scorestreaks to use in rank.

5533
03:30:24,150 --> 03:30:27,810
And if you really, really want to win those ranked games, I would highly recommend y'all use these.

5534
03:30:27,990 --> 03:30:31,210
Anyways guys, I hope that y'all can take some of these insights and apply them to your own game.

5535
03:30:31,290 --> 03:30:31,370
Oh!

5536
03:30:31,410 --> 03:30:33,390
I got John got it!

5537
03:30:33,690 --> 03:30:35,570
John got it!

5538
03:30:35,570 --> 03:30:35,570
John got it!

5539
03:30:35,870 --> 03:30:38,530
Thanks for the, thanks for the tips, space.

5540
03:30:39,430 --> 03:30:40,590
Congratulations!

5541
03:30:41,950 --> 03:30:42,610
John!

5542
03:30:43,030 --> 03:30:45,590
The one pull I lost!

5543
03:30:45,930 --> 03:30:48,610
The one pull he lost!

5544
03:30:48,930 --> 03:30:50,070
That's crazy!

5545
03:30:50,930 --> 03:30:52,810
And so unlucky!

5546
03:30:53,810 --> 03:30:57,370
John has received the VIP!

5547
03:31:01,790 --> 03:31:04,490
That's fate intended!

5548
03:31:08,070 --> 03:31:10,470
Alright, roles manager.

5549
03:31:11,110 --> 03:31:12,450
Add new.

5550
03:31:14,010 --> 03:31:15,370
VIP.

5551
03:31:15,950 --> 03:31:16,850
Congratulations!

5552
03:31:17,090 --> 03:31:19,530
You have received!

5553
03:31:20,090 --> 03:31:22,510
You have received VIP!

5554
03:31:23,390 --> 03:31:29,070
You, you overtook Delta's VIP for it.

5555
03:31:29,650 --> 03:31:31,510
Alright, now let me close this.

5556
03:31:32,710 --> 03:31:36,330
The one time, I just, I wanted to have a little fun.

5557
03:31:36,990 --> 03:31:39,350
Into the chair you go, Delta.

5558
03:31:39,910 --> 03:31:41,810
Wait, John, what was your prediction rate?

5559
03:31:43,550 --> 03:31:45,450
John, what was your prediction rate?

5560
03:31:46,410 --> 03:31:48,190
How many times did you get it correctly?

5561
03:31:51,860 --> 03:31:53,320
Too much pack.

5562
03:31:53,520 --> 03:31:57,160
Wait, was this in his first one that he got correct?

5563
03:31:57,160 --> 03:31:57,380
Correct?

5564
03:31:57,820 --> 03:32:00,040
Oh my god, that's dope!

5565
03:32:01,240 --> 03:32:02,440
Oh, and won all three.

5566
03:32:02,600 --> 03:32:05,260
Oh, he had a hundred percent win rate!

5567
03:32:05,560 --> 03:32:08,420
He had a hundred percent prediction rate!

5568
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:12,560
Oh, he was a true Paul the Octopus.

5569
03:32:13,000 --> 03:32:15,580
He was Paul the Octopus!

5570
03:32:18,180 --> 03:32:19,300
No way!

5571
03:32:19,920 --> 03:32:22,520
We should have all listened to him!

5572
03:32:23,340 --> 03:32:24,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

5573
03:32:25,100 --> 03:32:29,440
Delta was the fa- Del-Del-Del-Del was the false prophet all along!

5574
03:32:30,880 --> 03:32:32,940
Sir Jet, thank you for the hundred bitties!

5575
03:32:33,080 --> 03:32:34,100
Thank you, thank you!

5576
03:32:35,180 --> 03:32:38,320
In the end, Del-Del-Del was the false prophet!

5577
03:32:38,320 --> 03:32:41,100
You're actually so evil!

5578
03:32:41,820 --> 03:32:43,960
Darkflame, thank you for the hundred bitties!

5579
03:32:44,180 --> 03:32:45,380
Thank you, thank you!

5580
03:32:46,160 --> 03:32:47,520
You were so close!

5581
03:32:48,380 --> 03:32:49,140
So close!

5582
03:32:52,700 --> 03:32:53,780
So, that was fun!

5583
03:32:54,180 --> 03:32:58,920
I don't know, in the end, I think in the end, I definitely had the most fun with these predictions!

5584
03:32:58,920 --> 03:33:01,820
As we all know, the house always wins!

5585
03:33:02,300 --> 03:33:03,240
Viva Las Vegas!

5586
03:33:03,760 --> 03:33:06,940
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

5587
03:33:08,900 --> 03:33:09,340
But yeah!

5588
03:33:09,980 --> 03:33:12,060
Let me double check real quick!

5589
03:33:16,980 --> 03:33:18,380
I didn't know if I have to...

5590
03:33:18,380 --> 03:33:19,560
Because I know they have show matches!

5591
03:33:22,980 --> 03:33:26,240
So I want to make sure if we are doing show matches or not!

5592
03:33:28,520 --> 03:33:28,960
Uh...

5593
03:33:30,040 --> 03:33:32,080
But yeah, that was really fun though.

5594
03:33:32,520 --> 03:33:33,820
I hope you guys enjoy it!

5595
03:33:34,800 --> 03:33:41,700
Thank you again to Samson for, you know, the experience and watching the finals there.

5596
03:33:41,940 --> 03:33:54,980
I'm just gonna make sure, because I know they do have show matches after, so I want to be sure that if we're watching show matches or we raid into the show matches.

5597
03:33:54,980 --> 03:33:58,100
Uh, but Rysox, thank you for the 2,000 biddies!

5598
03:33:58,300 --> 03:33:59,280
Thank you, thank you!

5599
03:33:59,700 --> 03:34:00,720
Prediction stream, guys.

5600
03:34:00,860 --> 03:34:02,000
It was a prediction stream.

5601
03:34:02,660 --> 03:34:04,000
We're just having fun.

5602
03:34:05,340 --> 03:34:07,880
We're having fun watching Space vs.

5603
03:34:08,580 --> 03:34:09,120
Jez.

5604
03:34:09,440 --> 03:34:14,800
That's crazy though, because like, I think Space was the underdog throughout all of that.

5605
03:34:15,640 --> 03:34:17,160
Because like, he retired.

5606
03:34:17,540 --> 03:34:20,040
He did retire, like, earlier.

5607
03:34:20,200 --> 03:34:21,520
He retired last year.

5608
03:34:21,740 --> 03:34:24,120
And Jez was like, actively competing too.

5609
03:34:24,120 --> 03:34:29,480
So, um, it was, it was actually like, like, the odds were against him.

5610
03:34:30,520 --> 03:34:34,800
I had fun, but some goons are eating ice water now.

5611
03:34:35,840 --> 03:34:39,060
Some dragoons have lost their house.

5612
03:34:42,740 --> 03:34:45,720
I had fun though, guys.

5613
03:34:46,140 --> 03:34:50,560
I don't know about you guys, but I had fun.

5614
03:34:51,380 --> 03:34:55,280
Some would never, never tell me about the odds again.

5615
03:34:57,380 --> 03:34:57,980
Um...

5616
03:34:57,980 --> 03:34:58,500
Oh my god.

5617
03:34:58,680 --> 03:34:59,700
Who's broke right now?

5618
03:35:00,320 --> 03:35:01,840
Who's broke and who's rich?

5619
03:35:01,860 --> 03:35:02,760
I wanna know.

5620
03:35:04,300 --> 03:35:05,500
I wanna know.

5621
03:35:05,640 --> 03:35:06,600
Who has...

5622
03:35:06,600 --> 03:35:07,380
Who...

5623
03:35:07,380 --> 03:35:08,880
Who has a lot of...

5624
03:35:08,880 --> 03:35:09,280
Who...

5625
03:35:09,280 --> 03:35:11,280
Who has made bank?

5626
03:35:11,280 --> 03:35:12,780
And who has lost everything?

5627
03:35:13,300 --> 03:35:15,080
Sir Jet, thank you for the super chat.

5628
03:35:15,260 --> 03:35:16,600
Thank you for the biddies.

5629
03:35:16,760 --> 03:35:17,540
Thank you, thank you.

5630
03:35:17,680 --> 03:35:19,000
Oh my gosh, I like...

5631
03:35:19,000 --> 03:35:20,960
Confusing biddies and super chats.

5632
03:35:21,720 --> 03:35:23,000
I lost everything.

5633
03:35:23,360 --> 03:35:26,180
Oh husband, you better lost all 67k.

5634
03:35:26,420 --> 03:35:27,500
Now we are homeless.

5635
03:35:31,480 --> 03:35:33,400
I have 200 points, smile.

5636
03:35:34,100 --> 03:35:34,720
I'm at...

5637
03:35:34,720 --> 03:35:36,800
Wait, you're at 272 Sean?

5638
03:35:37,120 --> 03:35:38,700
Why didn't you claim the VIP?

5639
03:35:45,460 --> 03:35:46,040
Sean!

5640
03:35:46,480 --> 03:35:47,780
You could have had it!

5641
03:35:47,980 --> 03:35:49,000
Oh, John clicked...

5642
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:49,740
John was faster.

5643
03:35:50,000 --> 03:35:51,300
He didn't want it.

5644
03:35:51,740 --> 03:35:53,180
He's classy.

5645
03:35:53,180 --> 03:35:53,560
See...

5646
03:35:53,560 --> 03:35:55,720
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

5647
03:35:55,780 --> 03:35:56,700
He's still there...

5648
03:35:56,700 --> 03:35:59,340
...for our final event of the day.

5649
03:35:59,740 --> 03:36:02,520
A 1v1 to determine it all.

5650
03:36:02,660 --> 03:36:03,980
We already saw our grand finals...

5651
03:36:03,980 --> 03:36:06,180
I want, I'm waiting to see if...

5652
03:36:07,180 --> 03:36:07,660
Uh...

5653
03:36:09,300 --> 03:36:11,860
If we are watching the show matches or not.

5654
03:36:11,920 --> 03:36:12,760
I'm not sure though.

5655
03:36:13,660 --> 03:36:14,520
I'm not sure.

5656
03:36:17,000 --> 03:36:18,140
We'll watch like...

5657
03:36:18,140 --> 03:36:19,620
We'll watch like one round.

5658
03:36:19,800 --> 03:36:20,880
And then we'll call it here.

5659
03:36:25,000 --> 03:36:26,260
Let me double-check.

5660
03:36:26,400 --> 03:36:27,920
I'll double-check real quick, guys.

5661
03:36:29,020 --> 03:36:29,500
Wow!

5662
03:36:33,720 --> 03:36:35,600
Destination point Samsung, guys!

5663
03:36:37,960 --> 03:36:41,500
With a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

5664
03:36:42,560 --> 03:36:47,040
The improved cooling system means you can game for longer without worrying about overheating.

5665
03:36:47,040 --> 03:36:50,320
And it's a match made in the stars only...

5666
03:36:50,320 --> 03:36:52,260
Time, we use the bathroom, and then I'll double-check.

5667
03:36:52,960 --> 03:36:53,860
I'll be right back!

5668
03:36:54,000 --> 03:36:56,280
...to Samsung Galaxy for this entire event.

5669
03:36:56,440 --> 03:36:59,460
This is, after all, the Samsung Galaxy Gear Up Cup.

5670
03:36:59,680 --> 03:37:07,760
But it is time for us to invite, for the final time tonight, our captains of our grand finalists to the stage.

5671
03:37:08,060 --> 03:37:10,820
Let's welcome Jez and Space!

5672
03:37:25,160 --> 03:37:32,580
Well, I know both of you are not only professionals at this point, but you've probably been here for some interviews before, but now we're gonna make it a little different.

5673
03:37:32,780 --> 03:37:32,920
No?

5674
03:37:33,300 --> 03:37:36,540
All right, well, then this will be a first, so I'm gonna let you talk a little bit of trash.

5675
03:37:36,840 --> 03:37:39,640
First, I have to go to the winner of our grand final.

5676
03:37:40,080 --> 03:37:41,800
Look, there's no secret here.

5677
03:37:42,000 --> 03:37:43,740
You guys have already faced off in a 1v1.

5678
03:37:43,860 --> 03:37:44,980
It was very close.

5679
03:37:45,760 --> 03:37:47,480
How are you gonna do the same thing twice?

5680
03:37:48,100 --> 03:37:48,980
I don't know.

5681
03:37:49,200 --> 03:37:49,740
I'm scared.

5682
03:37:49,920 --> 03:37:54,820
I feel like whenever he had a lead, he, like, let his foot off the gas, and then whenever I caught up, he put it back on.

5683
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:56,880
So I feel like this one, he's going full throttle.

5684
03:37:57,040 --> 03:37:57,940
I have no clue what to expect.

5685
03:37:58,520 --> 03:38:04,100
Well, it sounds like your opponent doesn't really know what to expect, but you probably have a little bit of a game plan.

5686
03:38:04,220 --> 03:38:09,520
You've had some chance to get some revenge at this point, so what are you gonna do to get your revenge?

5687
03:38:10,360 --> 03:38:10,920
Just win.

5688
03:38:13,140 --> 03:38:16,900
Just win is not the worst strategy I have ever heard.

5689
03:38:16,900 --> 03:38:19,800
It is three 1v1s, though, at this point here.

5690
03:38:19,980 --> 03:38:25,020
One thing we did see in your quarterfinal, or I guess semifinal, is you switched the shotguns.

5691
03:38:25,240 --> 03:38:26,640
Any plan on doing that again?

5692
03:38:27,540 --> 03:38:28,840
Probably not this one, no.

5693
03:38:29,880 --> 03:38:31,960
Gonna keep it all serious, fair enough.

5694
03:38:32,160 --> 03:38:36,700
Any tricks up your sleeve at this point, or is it business as usual, sniper in hand, AR in the other?

5695
03:38:37,140 --> 03:38:37,700
Same thing.

5696
03:38:38,400 --> 03:38:44,400
Alright, it sounds like there's no funny business at this point, so gentlemen, I will say, get to your stations, and good luck to the both of you.

5697
03:38:46,900 --> 03:38:50,300
Alright, that is Jez and Space, our finalists here.

5698
03:38:50,500 --> 03:38:57,180
The grand finals has concluded, but now it is time for our $15,000 show match.

5699
03:38:57,820 --> 03:39:01,740
Let's throw it to the casters and get ready for our final fight.

5700
03:39:03,900 --> 03:39:09,260
Thank you so much, Mr. Bass from the past, we are here, final moments.

5701
03:39:09,300 --> 03:39:09,720
I'm back!

5702
03:39:10,440 --> 03:39:11,540
I'm back, guys.

5703
03:39:11,920 --> 03:39:12,720
Oh, let me see.

5704
03:39:13,420 --> 03:39:13,680
Alright!

5705
03:39:15,040 --> 03:39:16,740
Alright, guys, so, I'm...

5706
03:39:17,320 --> 03:39:24,040
So this is the end of my portion of the stream, but I will raid into the official broadcast.

5707
03:39:24,040 --> 03:39:26,040
For those who want to continue watching...

5708
03:39:26,580 --> 03:39:27,600
Oh, it's Jez versus Space.

5709
03:39:28,100 --> 03:39:32,640
For those who want to continue watching, I will raid into the final show match.

5710
03:39:32,820 --> 03:39:34,100
Thank you, everybody, for coming!

5711
03:39:34,100 --> 03:39:35,800
And huge shoutout to Samsung again.

5712
03:39:36,160 --> 03:39:43,200
This entire tournament, the Galaxy Gear Up Cup was powered by Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and presented by Samsung.

5713
03:39:43,360 --> 03:39:46,840
So again, huge shoutout to them for allowing me to do this official co-stream.

5714
03:39:47,400 --> 03:39:50,420
For them, please check, exclamation point, Samsung out.

5715
03:39:50,860 --> 03:39:54,600
Check the phone out as well, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

5716
03:39:54,600 --> 03:39:58,280
This entire tournament was run by... on the phone.

5717
03:39:58,660 --> 03:40:00,340
So like, on the exact phone.

5718
03:40:00,500 --> 03:40:02,320
So everything you saw, the gameplay and everything.

5719
03:40:02,900 --> 03:40:05,480
It's actually crazy, the things they could do with all of that.

5720
03:40:05,660 --> 03:40:06,620
And we had a lot of fun!

5721
03:40:06,820 --> 03:40:09,640
I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching today's stream.

5722
03:40:11,400 --> 03:40:16,280
And, you know, if you want to stay here, stay to watch the final show match.

5723
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:19,060
Just stay in the channel, and then I'm going to raid it into that.

5724
03:40:19,920 --> 03:40:20,860
And thank you, everybody!

5725
03:40:22,360 --> 03:40:25,660
It was always really fun to do these sponsor stream with you guys.

5726
03:40:26,200 --> 03:40:33,920
I feel like it doesn't even feel like a sponsor stream.

5727
03:40:34,060 --> 03:40:36,720
And we had so much fun doing these types of stuff together.

5728
03:40:37,040 --> 03:40:38,240
And just hanging out and everything.

5729
03:40:38,580 --> 03:40:41,160
And I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching with me.

5730
03:40:41,280 --> 03:40:46,780
And checking out mobile gaming for the first time, like mobile esports for the first time.

5731
03:40:47,640 --> 03:40:49,940
And yeah, I'm glad you guys enjoyed it.

5732
03:40:49,940 --> 03:40:54,540
But I had so much fun, and I had so much fun watching you guys lose all your points.

5733
03:40:58,960 --> 03:41:00,620
The house always wins.

5734
03:41:05,900 --> 03:41:07,640
Or win them, you know?

5735
03:41:08,280 --> 03:41:16,500
Okay, my favorite moment was when I priced the points, the $260k for the VIP.

5736
03:41:16,500 --> 03:41:22,300
And then just see like, just see DelDelta lose it all.

5737
03:41:23,560 --> 03:41:31,200
It was just within, it was within, like, it was just there.

5738
03:41:31,760 --> 03:41:35,380
Just lose it all on the one last prediction.

5739
03:41:40,840 --> 03:41:44,620
Mehdi, thank you for the 200 biddies, thank you, thank you.

5740
03:41:44,880 --> 03:41:46,480
Anything else about the phone call?

5741
03:41:46,480 --> 03:41:49,080
Well, just, um, it was good.

5742
03:41:49,100 --> 03:41:51,220
The surgery went great, like, went great.

5743
03:41:51,880 --> 03:41:54,320
And yeah, that's really all I can say.

5744
03:41:54,600 --> 03:41:57,380
I'll talk more about it next time on the...

5745
03:41:57,380 --> 03:42:00,640
You wasn't shambles, you monster.

5746
03:42:01,600 --> 03:42:03,300
Just right there.

5747
03:42:06,340 --> 03:42:08,940
The last 50-50.

5748
03:42:11,800 --> 03:42:13,640
Oh, sorry, I thought you meant the phone call.

5749
03:42:14,020 --> 03:42:14,700
Oh, the phone!

5750
03:42:14,940 --> 03:42:15,840
Oh, yes, so...

5751
03:42:16,660 --> 03:42:21,600
My favorite part about the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was the fact that, you know...

5752
03:42:21,600 --> 03:42:23,960
Like I said, it's on 120Hz.

5753
03:42:24,260 --> 03:42:26,020
So, I think that is my favorite part.

5754
03:42:26,220 --> 03:42:29,520
Just for the fact that it is, it has 120Hz refresh rate.

5755
03:42:29,520 --> 03:42:34,600
Uh, which for me is, like, really good for a phone, especially if you're, like, into mobile gaming.

5756
03:42:34,900 --> 03:42:38,840
Or, like, just, like, you know, having better refresh rate, better frames, in general.

5757
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:42,700
Like, that's, like, the one thing that I always look for in terms of, like, gaming as well.

5758
03:42:42,700 --> 03:42:50,000
Um, and, uh, and also the fact that it does run, like, it ran Call of Duty Mobile so well.

5759
03:42:50,220 --> 03:42:55,300
Like, um, yeah, 4.47, uh, um, GHz of processor.

5760
03:42:55,540 --> 03:42:57,260
Like, it ran this game so well.

5761
03:42:57,480 --> 03:42:59,360
Like, you can see the graphics and everything.

5762
03:42:59,660 --> 03:43:01,420
Like, was really smooth and stuff.

5763
03:43:01,500 --> 03:43:03,180
Like, with how intense the gameplay was.

5764
03:43:03,540 --> 03:43:05,520
Uh, but yes, thank you again to Samsung.

5765
03:43:06,040 --> 03:43:11,540
Um, this entire tournament was presented by Samsung, um, and, uh, powered by Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra!

5766
03:43:11,920 --> 03:43:13,860
Exclamation point of Samsung to please check it out.

03:43:14,220 --> 03:43:14,520
