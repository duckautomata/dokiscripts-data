1
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,720
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,920
Oh, my God, I'm so tired.

3
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,580
I'm so tired.

4
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,540
Hello, everyone.

5
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,060
Hello, everyone.

6
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,860
After the concert today, I went straight through nap time.

7
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,000
So, I'll talk more about the concert itself later today.

8
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,280
Later, later.

9
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,200
You don't sound... Oh, it's because I'm so... I literally just woke up and I'm, like, extra E.P.

10
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:40,220
I didn't really have a lot of sleep today because I had to, like, make sure everything was going smoothly.

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,020
And because of that, I didn't get to sleep much until after the concert.

12
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,620
But I'll talk more in depth about the concert later tonight because today is Marvel Rivals time!

13
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:06,520
Because, yes, surprise Rivals stream because I have the early season previews, early season access.

14
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,360
So, hey, guys.

15
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:09,940
Thank you for the outcome.

16
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:10,380
Super.

17
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Thank you.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,440
Thank you.

19
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,980
Since it's already on the 4th, I'm on my end.

20
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm totally not looking for excuses.

21
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,360
Throw money at you.

22
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,780
Happy birthday, my Kamiyoshi!

23
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,560
Happy birthday to you!

24
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,620
Happy birthday to you!

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,220
Happy birthday, Dookie Bird!

26
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,960
Happy birthday to you.

27
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,380
Yeah!

28
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,140
Thank you, guys!

29
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,720
Yes, tomorrow is my birthday.

30
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:28,760
Yay!

31
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,920
And tonight we're having a little countdown!

32
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,540
Wow!

33
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,100
Yes, so... Oh, yeah, by the way, I was late because...

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,380
I was...

35
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,620
The download for the early access literally opens...

36
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:44,980
Okay, sorry.

37
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,340
I didn't go to sleep straight away.

38
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,720
I had to, like...

39
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,380
I took a one hour...

40
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,460
I think I took, like, a 40 minute...

41
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,440
A 30 minute nap.

42
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,460
Because I had to download the files for Marvel Rivals...

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,900
At exactly...

44
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,640
I think it was, like, 4 p.m.

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,140
Yes, at 4 p.m.

46
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,960
The download link shows up for everybody.

47
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,140
For those who get early access.

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,440
And then, so I wake up and then I downloaded the file.

49
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,620
And then I had...

50
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,880
I set my alarm to 4.30.

51
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,480
Because it takes 4...

52
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,460
It takes, like, 30 minutes...

53
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,300
To download the file.

54
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,640
To download the file.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,280
And then I had to extract the...

56
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,020
So then I set it to 30 minutes.

57
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,000
And then...

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,760
But then I realized, oh, it's taking a while.

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,680
So...

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,560
It took a while to...

61
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Open the link to download the game.

62
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,360
So...

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,960
Because, like, everybody was clicking it.

64
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,240
So I waited until, like...

65
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,060
So the file didn't download until...

66
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,680
4...

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,940
Like, 4.15.

68
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,140
And then, um...

69
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,580
I down...

70
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,140
It was downloading at 4.15.

71
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,500
And then I took another 30-minute nap.

72
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,420
Uh...

73
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,480
Because after I downloaded it, I have to...

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,420
Extract the files.

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,580
And that's another 30 minutes.

76
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,540
So...

77
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,940
That's why we're a little late.

78
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,580
Because after I finished that...

79
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,280
I woke up again.

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,500
And I was like, oh, fuck it now.

81
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,760
I need to extract the file.

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,940
And then I...

83
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,740
Went to extract the file.

84
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,480
And I was like, okay, we're not gonna make it.

85
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,760
I need to push the stream time.

86
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
I need to push the stream time a little bit.

87
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,760
And then I took another 30-minute nap.

88
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,960
And then now I'm here.

89
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,540
But the game is finally finished downloading.

90
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,620
So we can finally play the game.

91
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,000
I won't go too much detail about Life Update or the concert today.

92
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,460
Because I'm gonna save all of that for tonight slash tomorrow.

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,580
So let's just go right into it.

94
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,940
So, um...

95
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,100
Yes.

96
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,420
Surprise Rival Stream.

97
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,840
Because I forgot that...

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,860
I've been so busy...

99
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,020
That I forgot about, like, the new season.

100
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,760
And didn't realize the early season previews were actually today.

101
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,580
But actually this week.

102
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,480
Because, you know, I've been prepping for my concert.

103
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,940
And my birthday for the last month.

104
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,360
So, I haven't really been doing much.

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,940
Uh, in terms of, like, um...

106
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,420
Other, like, you know...

107
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,300
I haven't been, like, really been paying too much attention to, like, the competitive side of my revivals.

108
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,200
Or just, like, you know, playing my revivals in general.

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,060
Just because I've been just so swamped with everything.

110
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,780
Um, but I was like, you know, fuck it, you know.

111
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,240
I need to...

112
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,540
I...

113
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,840
I need to take advantage of everything I can stream right now to pay off my debt.

114
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,240
I don't have any debts.

115
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,300
But...

116
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,560
I will reveal how much it costs later tonight for the concert.

117
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,660
Because at least...

118
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,780
It was nice to know that the general reception for the concert was really good.

119
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,160
So, I will let you guys know how much it costs in the end.

120
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,840
I'll let you guys in the VTuber secrets of, like, how much these things fucking cost.

121
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,060
So, I was like, I gotta stream as much as I can.

122
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:22,280
I need to make up for all that money I spent on not only producing the 3D concert, but also, like, you know, like, the mixing and everything as well.

123
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,460
So...

124
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,620
You know, I was...

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,740
Oh, my God.

126
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,140
Okay.

127
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,800
And then, apparently...

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:37,400
I don't remember if I told this in the member stream or if I said this in the member stream or if I said this, like, in the public stream.

129
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,460
But I was exchanging notes with another friend that has, like, has done, like, 3D concerts.

130
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,400
And, um, she was telling me, like, bro, that's pretty cheap.

131
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,300
Because, um, because I went with a Chinese studio for my 3D concert.

132
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:01,240
And my friend was, like, uh, who knows, like, JP concert prices was, like, bro, that's pretty cheap.

133
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,440
Because sometimes they charge double that.

134
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,700
And I was, like, no fucking way.

135
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,120
I was, like, no fucking way.

136
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,680
Because my concert looked really good for...

137
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,020
For them telling me that that's pretty, like, that's, like, the cheap end.

138
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,300
Oh, Kiko, thank you for the super chat.

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,360
Thank you, thank you.

140
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,400
Uh, Doki Brewed, happy birthday.

141
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,560
It's my birthday, too.

142
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,780
Happy to see the Sloppy Squad at the concert.

143
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,380
Happy birthday to you.

144
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,340
Happy birthday to you.

145
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,540
Happy birthday, dear Kiko.

146
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,260
Happy birthday to you.

147
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,760
Yeah, happy birthday.

148
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,980
Thank you again.

149
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,360
I really appreciate it.

150
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,180
All right.

151
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,820
Let me just boot up this game real fast.

152
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,780
Before we...

153
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,020
Oh, yeah.

154
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,660
By the way, I forgot to mention, for those who don't know about the new season change...

155
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,720
I won't be streaming too long.

156
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,140
I'll try to do, like, like, at least, like, an hour and a half or so.

157
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,580
Oh, my gosh.

158
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,140
If I could pass an hour, it's already, like, a miracle.

159
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,760
Because I'm so dead inside.

160
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,780
I am...

161
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,820
I'm so dead inside right now.

162
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,360
So, we hit an hour mark.

163
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,500
That's, like, an accomplishment right now.

164
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,040
All right.

165
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,640
Black Talon.

166
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,660
Thank you for the super chat.

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,100
Thank you.

168
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,780
Thank you.

169
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,680
Oh, boy.

170
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,840
Here I go.

171
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,480
Hope...

172
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,600
Helping to finance my Oshi streams again.

173
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,880
Also, happy early birthday to you, Toki.

174
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,980
Thank you for the super chat.

175
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,360
Thank you.

176
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,140
Thank you.

177
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,460
And thank you again for the birthday wishes.

178
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,560
Thank you, guys.

179
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,700
Now, like I said, I'll explain more in depth about, like, the hell I was in...

180
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,660
For the last month.

181
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,160
Don't worry.

182
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:54,740
All right.

183
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,940
I'll explain the hells later.

184
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,560
All right.

185
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:58,960
We're...

186
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,440
Oh, yeah.

187
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,640
I fucking...

188
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,720
I fucking forgot.

189
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,280
I fucking had a compromise, baby.

190
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,200
All right.

191
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,480
All right.

192
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,280
Oh, my God.

193
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,720
Okay.

194
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,580
All right.

195
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,840
I forgot.

196
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,380
It's been so long.

197
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,600
I forgot about this.

198
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,260
Okay.

199
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,160
Anyway, I guess I'll talk about Marvel Rivals more.

200
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:23,760
Oh, yeah.

201
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,900
Did I even mention?

202
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,080
The new character is Phoenix, by the way.

203
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,560
I...

204
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,780
I didn't even mention what the new character was.

205
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:44,980
The new character that they've launched for this new season three, which we are previewing, is Phoenix, and she's apparently going to be DPS.

206
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,700
I saw a little bit about it.

207
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,300
I saw a little bit about, like, what she does and everything.

208
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,240
So, it's going to be very interesting because apparently she seems very strong.

209
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,040
And some of her abilities have, like, no maximum range.

210
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,120
So, she seems a bit busted from what I read.

211
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,100
So, we'll see how that goes.

212
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,980
Also, Yosh, thank you for the super chat.

213
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,360
Thank you.

214
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,060
Thank you.

215
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:37,000
I still can't believe my friend was like, no, that's actually, like, cheaper than, like, the normal industry, like, the normal pricing if you went with, if you went with, like, you know, the average pricing in JP.

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,220
And I was like, there's no way.

217
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,680
That was so expensive.

218
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,320
And she's like, no, like, like, she was like, no, you don't understand.

219
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:52,240
Sometimes there, because, okay, well, obviously, it was five figures.

220
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,740
So, like, like, obviously, like, it was three, four, five.

221
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,920
Yeah, it was five figures.

222
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,500
But, apparently, it can go to six figures.

223
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,220
And mine didn't go to six figures.

224
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,740
But my friend was, like, saying, like, yeah, no, like, you know, like, sometimes they go for six figures.

225
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,280
And I was like, what?

226
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,830
So, I was like, oh, my God.

227
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,570
Um, yes, USD, I am talking in US dollars right now.

228
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,530
I am.

229
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,850
Um, but mine wasn't.

230
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,710
Mine, thank God, mine was not.

231
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,330
But to be fair, mine was, like, um, the shaders haunt you.

232
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,610
Thank you for the super chat, PB.

233
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,290
Thank you, thank you.

234
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,870
I know I said I wouldn't talk about the concert, but, like, you know, I need to kill time right now, because we're compiling shaders at the moment.

235
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:06,690
Um, um, but, but mine was shorter than, uh, you know, it's not an hour long.

236
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:15,130
It was, like, around 35 minutes for the concert, which is, like, you know, like, half, basically.

237
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,830
So, maybe that's why I, it was, like, it didn't go to six figures.

238
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,810
But it was still a lot.

239
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:29,290
I was, like, it still looked really good for, like, how, like, how, like, even, it was, like, it took a month.

240
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,570
I didn't, like, I, like, it was a month's work.

241
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,210
If I had, like, more than a month, maybe I can, like, pad out more time.

242
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:45,690
But it was, like, basically, like, it was, like, seven songs, plus, seven songs, plus, MC.

243
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:56,990
So, um, so it was, like, around, like, 35 minutes, which I thought was, like, I thought, it was crazy that seven songs was just 35 minutes.

244
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,050
I thought I was doing so much.

245
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,890
I literally thought, oh, my, oh, man, this is gonna be at least 45 minutes.

246
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,590
And then, like, after the concert, I was, like, wait, that's only 35?

247
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,950
That's, like, that's, like, 30 to 35?

248
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,710
I was, like, oh, fuck, what?

249
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,150
I was, like, oh, shit, I thought we were already at, I thought I did so much.

250
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,530
It felt like it was going on for a while.

251
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,870
And, all right.

252
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,270
All right.

253
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,990
Right, oh, my God, into another loading screen.

254
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,550
I for, oh, shit, I forgot to, I need to log in.

255
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,330
All right.

256
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:52,190
Let me, I forgot to, because, like, for this version, um, you have to log in specifically to an early access account.

257
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,910
So, let me grab the credentials for it real quick.

258
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,770
All right, copy, log in.

259
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,770
Oh, my gosh, my brain feels so goddamn slow right now.

260
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,410
Log in.

261
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,750
Password.

262
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,250
All right.

263
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,030
Oh, my God.

264
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,710
I don't have my settings, too.

265
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,870
Oh, my God.

266
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,830
Because it, like, resets everything, basically, whenever you're here.

267
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,670
And then, like, they don't, okay.

268
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,670
All right.

269
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,610
Because I can be Doki, Braid, apparently.

270
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,190
Not Doki.

271
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,270
Can I be not Doki?

272
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,850
Oh, my God.

273
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,610
What?

274
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,670
Oh, I can be not Doki.

275
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,130
Thank you.

276
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:36,410
Okay.

277
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,530
Yay!

278
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,950
Not Doki.

279
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,110
Let's go.

280
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,750
All right, guys.

281
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,450
Oh, Phoenix.

282
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:46,930
Okay.

283
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,910
Oh, okay.

284
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,910
There's new emotes and everything.

285
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:50,970
All right.

286
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,410
We're not Doki time.

287
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,270
Okay.

288
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,750
Let's, like, make sure...

289
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:56,850
Uh...

290
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,410
We're gonna change our settings because it resets everything.

291
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,330
Whenever you're on...

292
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,990
Because it's basically a new account.

293
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,750
It's not even my account, technically.

294
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,350
Because it's, like, an early access account.

295
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,410
So, it's not even mine.

296
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,030
Uh...

297
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,270
I said 1.83, right?

298
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:14,850
Uh...

299
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,810
1.83 cents.

300
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,110
Okay.

301
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,550
Nice.

302
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,510
Uh...

303
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,610
And then...

304
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,410
I assume, like...

305
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,210
The audio...

306
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:21,370
Okay.

307
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,230
And display...

308
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,330
Full screen...

309
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:24,970
Uh...

310
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,450
Low...

311
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,590
What's up?

312
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,810
The setting...

313
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,870
The graphics...

314
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:30,630
Um...

315
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,090
Transfer over.

316
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,830
But not the...

317
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,470
You would think keyboard controls would transfer over.

318
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,230
But it doesn't.

319
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,910
I don't know...

320
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,550
Understand why.

321
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,830
That's so weird.

322
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,710
Like, the one thing you think it should transfer over...

323
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,610
Doesn't transfer over.

324
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:43,730
Um...

325
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,270
Oh my god.

326
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,650
It's...

327
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,610
Also...

328
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,370
Not even my crosshair, too.

329
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,150
I'm just gonna do a random crosshair.

330
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,510
We'll do dot and then green.

331
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,370
That's usually what I do.

332
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,630
It's not my...

333
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,990
It's a little too thin.

334
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,690
It's short.

335
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,370
It's a little too small.

336
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,850
But honestly, it's okay.

337
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,450
Okay.

338
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,010
Um...

339
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,850
Let's see.

340
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,270
I need...

341
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,330
Communication...

342
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,950
I think...

343
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,370
Melee.

344
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,050
I need to do the melee.

345
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,570
Uh...

346
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:16,910
Melee...

347
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,910
And then communication...

348
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,610
We'll deal with this.

349
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,110
Sorry.

350
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,890
It's a little above average, guys.

351
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:23,590
But it's okay.

352
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,930
We can...

353
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,970
We can do...

354
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,290
It's a little above average.

355
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:31,670
Uh...

356
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,910
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p.

357
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,630
Alright.

358
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,590
Think...

359
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,790
We don't need to talk to people.

360
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,930
So we can...

361
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,830
Get rid of that.

362
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,870
They don't deserve my...

363
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,530
They don't deserve... my microphone.

364
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,870
Alright, let's look at... oh yeah, they have these new accessories now.

365
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,990
Where you can like basically... okay, I love how... Wait, he has a tongue?

366
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,430
Wait, do I have a... oh yeah, okay, so... yeah, we have accessory points now.

367
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,050
So, these are really interesting.

368
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:11,030
Because... Okay, I like how this looks like... okay, this one's pretty silly to me.

369
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:16,650
Because when I saw the preview for this... So, they're only like... it's only by Jeff and Psylocke.

370
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,190
But it's so interesting.

371
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,970
Because like... this looks like a nose ring.

372
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,090
I didn't even realize his tongue is out.

373
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,290
But like, he's licking her ass.

374
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,790
So... And you're like, what the fuck are you talking about?

375
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,970
Don't worry, I'll show you guys soon.

376
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,350
I saw like... I saw like preview pictures of it.

377
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,250
I was like, what the fuck?

378
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,290
They know what they're doing.

379
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,570
They actually...

380
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,230
And anyway, also they had a new feature.

381
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,490
Where if you're in university.

382
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,810
It apparently...

383
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,710
It's so like, you know, you could ruin your...

384
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,150
Education!

385
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,610
They're trying to get you while you're young.

386
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,210
Um, but...

387
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,790
If you're in university.

388
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,210
You can register for an account.

389
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,310
With your school email.

390
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,050
And they'll give you like, free stuff.

391
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,130
But it just... they get you while you're young.

392
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,030
And so, you know, you don't go to classes.

393
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,850
And you just play Marvel Rivals.

394
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,870
Okay.

395
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,250
Where the...

396
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,290
Alright, what is the...

397
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,270
Where's the new battle pass?

398
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,810
There it is.

399
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,450
Uh, that's how they get you.

400
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,050
Okay, and then people were talking about Squirrel Girl.

401
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,390
The Squirrel Girl new skin.

402
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,350
And like...

403
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,630
Not gonna lie, I understand.

404
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,350
I...

405
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,870
I understand!

406
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,170
I understand!

407
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:28,890
So...

408
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,130
They're like...

409
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,190
The people in the comments were like...

410
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,770
You know what?

411
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,650
I'm willing to take the risk.

412
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,510
I'm...

413
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,930
She looks like a Molly from Pokemon with the tail.

414
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:45,870
Okay, yeah.

415
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,990
Like...

416
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,810
Before we were like...

417
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,450
Before we were like...

418
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,150
You know what?

419
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:53,990
I'm...

420
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,770
I'm ready to take that risk.

421
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:57,970
Ooh.

422
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,680
Oh my god.

423
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,660
All those teeth.

424
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,360
Oh my god.

425
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,320
There's gold...

426
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,160
There's a gold panther.

427
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,880
Okay, so there's a gold panther.

428
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,400
And...

429
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,360
Holy thighs!

430
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,260
Risking it all!

431
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,420
High risk.

432
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,280
High rewards.

433
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,900
Rewards.

434
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,520
Okay.

435
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,480
Weapon Phoenix.

436
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
I don't really...

437
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,300
Play...

438
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,240
Oh my god!

439
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,440
Wait!

440
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,260
They have a symbi...

441
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,800
Oh my god!

442
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,100
I didn't even realize they have a symbiotic Groot too!

443
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,420
This is like...

444
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,300
Fully like...

445
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,200
Symbiotic theme.

446
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,240
By the way, for...

447
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,360
Half season...

448
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,460
Apparently it's gonna be...

449
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,920
It's gonna finally be...

450
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,440
Blade.

451
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,440
For the half season new character.

452
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,920
That's cool.

453
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,780
I didn't even think they have a symbiotic Groot as well.

454
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,200
Oh that shit is crazy.

455
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,780
That's...

456
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,460
That's a fucking crazy skin.

457
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,260
Oh yeah!

458
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:50,900
Uh...

459
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,140
Marvel Rivals released a statement and was saying how like...

460
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,620
Oh yeah!

461
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,500
They were like...

462
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,100
Basically we can make any Marvel character for this game so we're not gonna run out of characters.

463
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,880
So...

464
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,280
They're saying that in the future they might do like...

465
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
A fan vote on...

466
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,390
And vote on like...

467
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,060
Um...

468
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,420
Which character to add next in the future.

469
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,820
Cause there's just so many options.

470
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,940
And I thought that was really nice.

471
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,940
And then they do...

472
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,340
Yeah they...

473
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,520
Literally can like...

474
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:14,720
Make...

475
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,220
That's why they're like...

476
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,840
Yeah we're gonna add a new hero every fucking month.

477
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,320
So it's basically like...

478
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,460
League.

479
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,120
It's...

480
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,100
It's basically...

481
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,520
It's basically like League.

482
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,380
And then that's like printing money out.

483
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,360
Because like...

484
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,760
That's...

485
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Imagine how many skins you can do with that.

486
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,040
And then...

487
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,800
Uh...

488
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,040
There's Phoenix King.

489
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:35,800
Oh...

490
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,400
Coming soon.

491
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,440
Oh they don't have it yet.

492
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,600
Okay.

493
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,780
So there's Phoenix Namor.

494
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
Apparently Namor is like hella buff right now.

495
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,280
And they're also...

496
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,200
They're saying that they're like...

497
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,280
Yeah we wanna do like...

498
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,860
Characters that are not like...

499
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,540
As popular in the Marvel cin...

500
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,960
That aren't really in...

501
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,520
The Marvel Cinematic Universe.

502
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,280
So they're focusing on the more obscure characters.

503
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,060
Cause they're like...

504
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,560
Oh we want...

505
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,100
Oh my god.

506
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,860
There's...

507
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,140
White...

508
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,860
White Adam.

509
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,660
Alright.

510
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,440
Uh...

511
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,140
And then there's...

512
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,700
Black suit.

513
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,080
Crazy that.

514
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,940
There's black suit.

515
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,160
Oh isn't that like...

516
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,700
Isn't that...

517
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,500
That's like...

518
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,420
Pizza time!

519
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,400
Light mode.

520
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,960
Yeah there's...

521
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,860
Light mode Adam.

522
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,040
And night mode...

523
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,820
Light mode Adam.

524
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,500
And...

525
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,340
Oh my god it is!

526
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,080
Pizza time!

527
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,940
It is!

528
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,340
It is...

529
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,080
It is...

530
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,360
To...

531
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,700
Tobey Maguire!

532
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,700
Oh...

533
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,560
Wait that's sick.

534
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,300
That's...

535
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,700
I think this will be the only skin I buy.

536
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,960
But the only emote I buy for Spider-Man.

537
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:42,820
I'm...

538
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,500
I'm sold.

539
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,520
He lives on!

540
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,200
Bully McGuire!

541
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,320
Girls only want one thing.

542
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,420
And it's the evil... I like how they call it the evil dance.

543
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,140
The only time I'll ever buy the Battle Pass.

544
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,280
I literally only own one emote and it's her name.

545
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,260
Making it rain.

546
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,620
But soon, I will own two emos.

547
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,780
Okay, that shit's... What the fuck?

548
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,560
There's like...

549
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,180
It's on the jetpack too.

550
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,300
Oh, I don't like his tail.

551
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,460
Oh, that tail is so uncom...

552
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,740
It looks like a tentacle.

553
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,740
I am so uncomfortable with...

554
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,980
I'm so uncomfortable with the fucking tail.

555
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,940
It's like...

556
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,000
It looks like a goddamn...

557
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,820
It looks like...

558
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,160
A goddamn tentacle.

559
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,420
And I...

560
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,960
Oh my god.

561
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,740
I can hear the sound effects.

562
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,260
Hear me out!

563
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,220
He's a raccoon!

564
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,900
You can't say hear me out!

565
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,540
Yeah!

566
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,580
He's...

567
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,160
He's really a raccoon!

568
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,960
Okay, this shit is cute.

569
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,870
Aww!

570
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,290
Aww!

571
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,750
I like how symbiotic Jeff is just...

572
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,710
He's just like a...

573
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,930
Like a little bulldog.

574
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,170
Like...

575
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,170
We gotta pick two up.

576
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,950
Oh, and it's gonna be...

577
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:24,570
Devouring...

578
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,090
Oh, that's...

579
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,790
It's like an orc...

580
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:25,950
Yeah!

581
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,170
It's like a little orca whale!

582
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,110
Yeah, you're right!

583
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:28,990
Oh, that's cute!

584
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,390
He's a silly little guy!

585
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,210
Yeah!

586
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,390
Okay, I think...

587
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,590
Oh!

588
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,410
This one's good.

589
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,190
What's this?

590
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,120
Oh!

591
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,540
Alright, we gotta watch this again.

592
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,860
So we can actually have it...

593
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,880
Like a good full screen for it.

594
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,300
Oh!

595
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,860
Okay, that's cute.

596
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,540
What's this?

597
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,580
Oh, so he's like...

598
00:24:59,580 --> 00:24:59,740
No!

599
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
Don't wanna leave!

600
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,800
Alright, and that's all...

601
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,740
That's all the battle pass.

602
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,420
That's cute!

603
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,860
I like some of the skins here.

604
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,300
I like how...

605
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,220
Squirrel Girl...

606
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,260
The Squirrel Girl skin...

607
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,540
Is literally like...

608
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,600
The first one.

609
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,740
They know what's...

610
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,120
They know...

611
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,960
They...

612
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,420
It's the...

613
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,080
They know what they...

614
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,400
They know...

615
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,180
Why would it be the first one?

616
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,380
They know what we want.

617
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,260
Why else?

618
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,120
Can I even purchase it?

619
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,760
Oh, I can.

620
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,740
Alright.

621
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,660
Just cause...

622
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,840
Just for you freaks out.

623
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,580
It's like...

624
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,720
It doesn't cross over.

625
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,900
So...

626
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,800
What's the word called?

627
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,380
When like...

628
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,200
The stuff doesn't transfer over...

629
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,380
Is it just it doesn't transfer over?

630
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,820
It doesn't transfer over to like...

631
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,560
Your actual account.

632
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,820
So I'll just claim it.

633
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,260
Since they...

634
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
Since they like buffed her anyway.

635
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,020
Yeah, there's no cross progression.

636
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,120
Cause it's basically a new account that they gave you.

637
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,940
They fucking know.

638
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,860
Yeah.

639
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,360
Hey.

640
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,000
Alright.

641
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,720
This will be the only character to help buy a skin for...

642
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,120
For the newest...

643
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,580
For the...

644
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,040
For the newest season.

645
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,640
Not so Deadpool.

646
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
Thank you for the super chat.

647
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:23,960
Thank you.

648
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,460
Thank you.

649
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,660
You did amazing today, Doki.

650
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,060
Congrats on your concert.

651
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,840
Way to get sloppy and still stay on top.

652
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,060
Thank you for the super chat.

653
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,420
Thank you.

654
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:31,860
Thank you.

655
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,360
All right.

656
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,160
Phoenix time.

657
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,660
Jean... No, is it?

658
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,180
Jean Grey.

659
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,980
My only knowledge about her was in the X-Men movies.

660
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,560
Like, the really bad ones.

661
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,980
The really, really bad ones.

662
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,380
I was like... I feel bad.

663
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,520
So I was like, when did she become a good guy?

664
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,120
Yes.

665
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,560
That's my only knowledge of Phoenix.

666
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,120
Because, like, I think it ended on a cliffhanger on X-Men 3.

667
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,060
And so I was like, wait, she's good?

668
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,400
I'm so confused.

669
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,620
I was like, when did she became, like, uh... Yeah, she... Yeah.

670
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,340
And then, like, how did...

671
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,480
When did she became, like, a good guy in the end?

672
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,600
So I got confused during the trailer.

673
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,840
Um... But that was like, uh... Yeah, and then... And then she dies.

674
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,760
And I was like, but, like, the whole point about being Phoenix is that you can be reborn.

675
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,600
So, like, why does she die?

676
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,380
I was so confused.

677
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,660
I was like, my vague memories of watching X-Men 3.

678
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,020
And I was like, wait, she's dead?

679
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,700
Like, but... What... What's...

680
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,800
But being... How are... You're supposed to be reborn!

681
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,460
Oh, poor Scott, though.

682
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,580
Poor...

683
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,040
Okay, you know what's fucked up?

684
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,120
Um... Her boyfriend gets so little attention now...

685
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,160
That, like, I already forgot his, like, superhero name.

686
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,420
I'm just like, poor Scott.

687
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,880
Cyclops, yes!

688
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,620
I was like, I feel like...

689
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,540
Yeah, Cyclops always loses.

690
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,220
And, like, I feel like...

691
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,860
No one... It's been so long.

692
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,020
It's... It's actually been, like, so long for him.

693
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,020
That, like, I legitimately forgot his actual hero name.

694
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,700
Because...

695
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,780
I just feel sorry for that guy.

696
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,220
And I'm like, poor man.

697
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,620
He's... He's...

698
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,280
Like, in me... Like, he doesn't even...

699
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,680
The fact that Wolverine...

700
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,020
And Phoenix...

701
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,900
Are in Marvel Rivals.

702
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,880
And...

703
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,080
Poor... Poor Scott.

704
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,640
Also, fun fact.

705
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,480
I talked about this...

706
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,580
Before.

707
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,780
Um...

708
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,480
I talked about this...

709
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:58,900
Before.

710
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,360
But, like...

711
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,040
You know, like...

712
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,180
His laser eyes...

713
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,360
Aren't even lasers.

714
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,500
They're like...

715
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,100
What was it?

716
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,840
It's like...

717
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,820
Beams of Fit.

718
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,480
Like...

719
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,920
It's just a punching ray.

720
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,880
It's... It's like a kinetic ray.

721
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,800
It's not even a laser ray.

722
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,780
There is just...

723
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,180
A punch ray.

724
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,440
Yeah, yeah!

725
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,920
From the punch dimension!

726
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,140
There is...

727
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,060
His eyes is the portal to the punch dimension.

728
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,140
And...

729
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,800
It's basically a kinetic energy blast.

730
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,200
So they're not...

731
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,060
There is...

732
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,540
So they're not even lasers.

733
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,820
Uh...

734
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,980
They're like a gusset blast.

735
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,060
And he punches real...

736
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,980
He basically punches with his eyes.

737
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,040
Um...

738
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,640
Anyway...

739
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,200
Welcome...

740
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,120
Welcome back, Gene.

741
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,480
Um...

742
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Alright, so...

743
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,280
Ah...

744
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,900
Alright, Chaos Phoenix.

745
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,420
What does that even mean?

746
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,180
His eyes are the portal to the punch dimension.

747
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,900
So when he opens his eyes...

748
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,400
He's literally punching...

749
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,660
He's literally sending out...

750
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,380
Punches with his eyes.

751
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,070
Ha ha ha ha...

752
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,520
Ha ha ha ha...

753
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,320
Ha ha ha...

754
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,560
Ha ha ha ha!

755
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,640
Ha ha ha...

756
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:06,660
That's...

757
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:06,960
That's...

758
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,260
That's banget...

759
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,760
That's me...

760
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,320
There's no such thing as lasers.

761
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,860
It's literally...

762
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,580
Punch...

763
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,040
Dement...

764
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,420
Like...

765
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,760
Like punch beams.

766
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,300
Uh...

767
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,760
Eh...

768
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,440
Okay, not... It's alright.

769
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,360
It's alright.

770
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,500
The perfect fusion of Phoenix Force and Chaos... I think this is more so... I guess like... Oh wait, no!

771
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,400
They invented this skin.

772
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,580
First appearance... I was like, oh, maybe this is a comic book skin.

773
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,320
But they literally made this up.

774
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,200
Yeah, first appearance... You know, like the first appearance?

775
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,060
Wait, I'll show you guys.

776
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,500
It's like, first appearance in Marvel Rivals Season 3.

777
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,120
So they literally invented this skin.

778
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,420
Uh... For this game.

779
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,240
Okay.

780
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,200
Uh... That's interesting.

781
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,040
What about this one?

782
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,260
They're trying to... Oh yeah, okay.

783
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
X-Men Red.

784
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,640
Uh... Uh... Oh, it's like a red equivalent.

785
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,600
I don't know.

786
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,060
I'm not sure.

787
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,300
I'm not like, too sold on this skin, to be fair.

788
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,340
Oh my god.

789
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,440
No, I think they like, Grinner baited me too hard in Marvel Rivals.

790
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,540
So like, they gave her just like, more clothes.

791
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,300
And I was like...

792
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,420
I mean, I'm just like... I think that's it.

793
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,720
I was like... No, it's actually like, pretty neat.

794
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,720
But I think like, Rebels actually, Grinner baited me so hard that I...

795
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,100
I'm like... Too much.

796
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,680
Super, thank you for the super chat.

797
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,120
Thank you.

798
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,840
Thank you.

799
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,660
Paladin, thank you for the super chat.

800
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,060
Thank you.

801
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,780
Thank you.

802
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,100
In the comics, Cyclops is way cooler.

803
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,780
He even killed Professor X with powers at what...

804
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Oh my god, he punched an old man?

805
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,040
That's fucked up.

806
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,180
Thank you for the super chat.

807
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,620
Thank you.

808
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,320
Thank you.

809
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,420
Because like, the more I look at it, I do like...

810
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,100
I think it's just the color palette.

811
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,540
I'm just not a fan of the color palette.

812
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,420
I think that's it.

813
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,680
The magenta...

814
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,140
Um... The magenta with the fire.

815
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,060
I think that's it.

816
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,660
I think that's why I'm like, not a huge fan.

817
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,080
Um...

818
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,640
I just think... It must be the color palette.

819
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,380
Because I'm like, not too sold for it.

820
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,920
Um... I like this.

821
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,800
This is cool.

822
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,540
I like the little, like, the details on this.

823
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,200
Alright, let's see.

824
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,080
What are the MVP?

825
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,140
Ooh... Okay, this is gonna be so disorienting because there's two of them.

826
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,560
Does this have a hitbox?

827
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,420
It doesn't, right?

828
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,740
I assume, like... I assume she doesn't have a hitbox, but it's gonna be so disorienting when there's two of them flying around.

829
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,580
Ooh...

830
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,120
Oh, I'm hitting my second wind, guys.

831
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm not tired anymore.

832
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,440
I'm... I can feel the second wind in my fucking body.

833
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,220
Yeah, it's like a JoJo stand.

834
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,480
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

835
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,400
Here comes Dokita Mutinator!

836
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Thank you for the super chat team.

837
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,020
Thank you, thank you.

838
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,860
Alright, what about... okay.

839
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,400
Cosmic.

840
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,460
Apparently, she's, like, hella... like, her DPS is, like, hella, but faster.

841
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,200
Launch a fire projectile forward, applying one spark to enemies hit.

842
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,400
Criticates apply...

843
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,540
Oh, it's stacked damage!

844
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,700
So, like, the more you hit, the more it's... like, the more damage you cause.

845
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,900
So, like, her DPS for hella is just a faster hella DPS.

846
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,760
Like, the, the left click.

847
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,960
Um...

848
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,700
Okay, so, if you have...

849
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:56,720
Okay, if you do a fiery explosion that has a stacked spark, then you can have time to heal.

850
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,020
Okay, Sparks will not stack within a brief period.

851
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,280
Alright, what's this?

852
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,960
Endstone Inferno.

853
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,880
Oh, shit.

854
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,940
Wait, that's it?

855
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,000
Dealing devastating damage hit while creating shot weight that destroys...

856
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,220
Oh!

857
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,840
It cancels everything.

858
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,700
Okay, so...

859
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,620
It destroys enemy summons, shields, and any bonus health.

860
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,840
Enemies hit are applied with one spark.

861
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,200
So, basically, if you have, like, you know, if you have, like, low-key clones, lamps...

862
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,420
I assume the lamps... it destroys lamps, right?

863
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,460
So, I'm gonna try that out later and see if it destroys lamps.

864
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,200
But, it can one-shot Rocky ult.

865
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:40,980
Uh...

866
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,740
Any type, like, turrets.

867
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,180
Uh...

868
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,680
Yeah, it just strips it all away.

869
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,600
It also stops Hella ult, too.

870
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,940
Okay, so...

871
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,220
Yeah.

872
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:50,960
Uh...

873
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,680
Rocket...

874
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,540
Hella ult and Rocket ult are summons.

875
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,040
Oh, okay.

876
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,480
So, Rocket ult will be useless.

877
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,500
And everything.

878
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,480
So, they'll just instant...

879
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,960
It just instant heals everything.

880
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,140
Yeah, it clears all...

881
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,120
You activated my trap card!

882
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,200
And you're like...

883
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,340
Not so fast, Kaiba!

884
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,260
I put on...

885
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:15,010
I put down Phoenix, which clears all trap cards summons.

886
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,020
Okay.

887
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,580
Pot of Gre...

888
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,580
I play Pot of Gre...

889
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,160
Not so fast!

890
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,400
Can't catch me!

891
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

892
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,340
Okay, leave behind illusion and instantly teleport in the desire.

893
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,820
Followed by detonating the illusion.

894
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,140
Enemies hit or apply...

895
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,560
Oh, okay.

896
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,360
So...

897
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,980
Okay, so there's a...

898
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,620
So I can be like...

899
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,020
Peek-a-boo and then TP back.

900
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,020
Merge with the Phoenix entering a state of free flight.

901
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,860
Gain a movement boost while continuously...

902
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,600
Okay, so that's her escape ability.

903
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,860
What about telekinesis first?

904
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,120
What the fuck is that?

905
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,620
The fire blast stuns enemy while the two explosion inflicts slow.

906
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Okay, so that's like the torch's little flame thing.

907
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,800
Okay.

908
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,920
So...

909
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,980
I summon Dark Magician.

910
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,640
Dark Magician.

911
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,060
Okay, welcome to the tomato farm.

912
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,000
Welcome, welcome.

913
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,400
Uh, Jakarta.

914
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,380
Thank you for the super chat.

915
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,300
Thank you, thank you.

916
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,540
You want to see Cyclops and Phoenix done right?

917
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,700
Highly recommend seeing the new X-Men 97 and our enemies series.

918
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,300
Though it's a follow-up to the OG 90 show.

919
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,680
They make it so you can watch it on its own too.

920
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,600
Thank you for the super chat.

921
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,340
Thank you, thank you.

922
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,300
Yeah, I've heard a lot about the...

923
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:35,900
The...

924
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,780
Like the...

925
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,160
The sequel for it.

926
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,040
Um, and like it won a lot of awards.

927
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,780
And then I also heard the creator was freaking weird.

928
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,600
But I don't know.

929
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,200
I don't remember what he did.

930
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,460
People were like, God damn.

931
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,360
I wish the creator wasn't a fucking weirdo.

932
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,000
But I don't remember what he did.

933
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:51,760
I...

934
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,760
It was just...

935
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,820
I just saw people on Twitter talking about it.

936
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,500
Um...

937
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't remember.

938
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,060
Um...

939
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,160
I don't remember.

940
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,240
But I heard that the new show was really, really good.

941
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,140
Um...

942
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,180
That was the only reason why I heard about this show.

943
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,220
Because people were talking about the creator.

944
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,620
Being...

945
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,540
Fucking weird.

946
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,000
Um...

947
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:19,920
Um...

948
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,660
I didn't hear good things about that show.

949
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,060
Okay, so apparently Wolverine is super busted now.

950
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,660
Because when she...

951
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,060
He teams up with Phoenix.

952
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,250
He has...

953
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,980
Lifesteal.

954
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,060
So...

955
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,140
Um...

956
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,240
That's not cool.

957
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,040
That's...

958
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,660
Like...

959
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know what else to say.

960
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,700
But...

961
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,240
That's not very cool.

962
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:40,820
But yeah.

963
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,780
Basically, Wolver...

964
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,180
Wolverine has lifesteal now.

965
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:43,880
Alright.

966
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,740
What a...

967
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,240
Okay, wait.

968
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,620
We're gonna...

969
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,160
Alright.

970
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,360
How do I do this?

971
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,540
So apparently...

972
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,800
Now that...

973
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,640
Uh...

974
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:51,920
Okay.

975
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,720
Where's my menu?

976
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,600
Okay.

977
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,320
Change hero.

978
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,080
So you...

979
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,000
If you change your character...

980
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,140
To...

981
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,060
Like...

982
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,100
With the skin and everything.

983
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,600
It actually changes the lobby.

984
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,440
Does it?

985
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,060
Oh, yeah.

986
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:05,740
Oh!

987
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,240
Wait, I like that.

988
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,280
It changes the lobby image too.

989
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,460
Yeah.

990
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:11,800
Oh!

991
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,320
Wait, that's cool.

992
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,180
I like that.

993
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,200
Uh...

994
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,040
So the lobby and everything changes too.

995
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,300
When you...

996
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,240
When you...

997
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:19,740
Um...

998
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,460
When you...

999
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:20,780
Uh...

1000
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,300
Swap it.

1001
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,620
You wanna see the Lord icon for Phoenix?

1002
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:23,960
Alright.

1003
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,180
Let's see if it's good or not.

1004
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,260
Looks like...

1005
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:27,600
Oh!

1006
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,340
That's pretty good.

1007
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,340
I like it.

1008
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,120
I mean...

1009
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,300
Compared to the default?

1010
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,240
That's pretty nice.

1011
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,460
I don't know about the finger.

1012
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,320
It looks like sausage...

1013
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,140
Sausage hands.

1014
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,820
But other than...

1015
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,720
Okay!

1016
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,660
Does it not look like...

1017
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,360
She's holding a fucking sausage?

1018
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,520
Other than the sausage...

1019
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,000
It's like...

1020
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,960
Everything else looks good.

1021
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,300
I think if they remove...

1022
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:48,840
The...

1023
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,180
The giant ass sausage finger...

1024
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,980
Um...

1025
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,240
It's actually pretty good.

1026
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,400
No, it's...

1027
00:38:59,400 --> 00:38:59,920
It's flipping you.

1028
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,900
No, I'm pretty sure she's like...

1029
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,820
Like, why is this so thick?

1030
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,360
Her finger is so thick.

1031
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,200
It looks like...

1032
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,860
Like, okay, it doesn't look like a baguette.

1033
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,300
Because it's not thick enough for a baguette.

1034
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:09,920
But like...

1035
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,560
It's thick enough to be a...

1036
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,340
Long ass sausage.

1037
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,820
Like...

1038
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,140
Like...

1039
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,500
Like...

1040
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:16,780
Like...

1041
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,440
So like...

1042
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,980
I feel like if they remove this...

1043
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,060
It'd look pretty good.

1044
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,820
Uh...

1045
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,060
Alright.

1046
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,760
New team ups.

1047
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,160
So they added some new team up...

1048
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,800
Team up guys.

1049
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,920
Um...

1050
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,280
I believe it's...

1051
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,500
What was it?

1052
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,680
I also gotta remove some team ups too.

1053
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,400
Oh yeah.

1054
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,420
This one's crazy.

1055
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,100
Because...

1056
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,040
Squirrel Girl can now have homing missiles too.

1057
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,360
And this one's sad.

1058
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,240
I'm so sad.

1059
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,840
It's also crazy.

1060
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,340
But it makes me sad.

1061
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,720
So...

1062
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,300
Um...

1063
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,380
So Spider-Man does like...

1064
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,860
Fire damage now too.

1065
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,000
Like...

1066
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,540
Yay.

1067
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,660
Uh...

1068
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,100
Damn it.

1069
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,240
Thank you for the super chat.

1070
00:39:59,380 --> 00:39:59,660
Thank you.

1071
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,260
Thank you.

1072
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,840
So it burns...

1073
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,600
Over time.

1074
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,560
So...

1075
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,540
Damages over time.

1076
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,140
So...

1077
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,260
That shit's scary.

1078
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,040
Uh...

1079
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,140
Uh...

1080
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,440
The torch is already pretty broken.

1081
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,140
And then for this one...

1082
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,680
Um...

1083
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,840
This is basically...

1084
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,020
Okay.

1085
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,420
Well...

1086
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,320
Basically...

1087
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,980
I saw someone on Twitter talk about it.

1088
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,080
But...

1089
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,740
Her...

1090
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,200
Her missile...

1091
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,340
Uh...

1092
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:19,860
Team up.

1093
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,300
The squirrel missiles.

1094
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,540
Thank god she has an actual decent team up.

1095
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,420
Uh...

1096
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,080
Because like...

1097
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,480
Who the fuck is playing Penny right now?

1098
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,220
Um...

1099
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,580
Uh...

1100
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,480
But...

1101
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,300
She has a homing nut.

1102
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,340
And the thing about her homing nut...

1103
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,220
Is that...

1104
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,720
There's no range...

1105
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,880
There's no maximum range from what I saw on Twitter.

1106
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:38,920
Uh...

1107
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,380
So...

1108
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:39,800
That...

1109
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,060
That sounds pretty crazy.

1110
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,400
And then for this one...

1111
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,880
The hella one...

1112
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,540
Um...

1113
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,580
It's basically...

1114
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,940
If people are grouped up...

1115
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,280
There's like...

1116
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,760
There's like...

1117
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,500
Tendril to it.

1118
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,400
So...

1119
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,880
I assume that...

1120
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,560
It...

1121
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,860
Increases the...

1122
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,240
Range.

1123
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,040
Yeah.

1124
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,080
Increases the range of her...

1125
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,860
Of her...

1126
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,840
What ability is that?

1127
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,140
E.

1128
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,760
Of her E.

1129
00:40:59,240 --> 00:40:59,540
Yeah.

1130
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,160
She has...

1131
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,900
You can't escape her nut.

1132
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,380
Okay.

1133
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,240
I believe that's all of...

1134
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,420
Yeah.

1135
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,100
I think that's all of...

1136
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,760
The newer...

1137
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,080
Stuff.

1138
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:12,520
Okay.

1139
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,740
Let's go to training.

1140
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,400
Real quick.

1141
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,260
I don't know...

1142
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,580
I really remember...

1143
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,120
Exactly.

1144
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,640
What are...

1145
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,020
All the new changes...

1146
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,500
For everything?

1147
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,220
Um...

1148
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,340
Welcome to the training ground.

1149
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:23,740
Okay.

1150
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,060
We go.

1151
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,840
Alright.

1152
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,960
So let's grab...

1153
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,740
It's nut time.

1154
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,380
Oh.

1155
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,240
God.

1156
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:31,860
I do...

1157
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,400
Okay.

1158
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:32,700
They...

1159
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:32,980
Oh.

1160
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,380
Whoa.

1161
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:37,780
Oh.

1162
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,820
Like she has a symbiotic voice too.

1163
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:40,800
Nice.

1164
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,760
Alright.

1165
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,560
So...

1166
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,420
Oh my god.

1167
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,160
It's been so long since I played Squirrel Girl.

1168
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:46,780
Alright.

1169
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:46,800
Alright.

1170
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,460
Let's do the team up real fast.

1171
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,660
Uh...

1172
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,660
Wanna play her?

1173
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,060
Alright.

1174
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,740
So...

1175
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,140
Yo!

1176
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,180
We...

1177
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,440
Yahoo!

1178
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,020
Oh shit.

1179
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,660
For all you tail lovers over there.

1180
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,600
Alright.

1181
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,020
Alright.

1182
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,340
So...

1183
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:11,460
Okay.

1184
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,000
Let me see.

1185
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:13,980
Uh...

1186
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,520
Let's do...

1187
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,000
I need to make sure there's no cooldown.

1188
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:16,320
Okay.

1189
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:16,940
So...

1190
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,520
But that's crazy.

1191
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:17,860
Haha.

1192
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,500
Haha.

1193
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,020
There's no maximum range.

1194
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,620
Haha.

1195
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:25,760
Haha.

1196
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,040
Haha.

1197
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,500
Your tail is so distracting.

1198
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,680
Haha.

1199
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,540
Haha.

1200
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,120
Haha.

1201
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,540
High risk.

1202
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,300
High reward.

1203
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:34,920
Haha.

1204
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:36,260
Haha.

1205
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,720
Haha.

1206
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,400
But the cooldown is like...

1207
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,220
Pretty...

1208
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,060
Pretty long though.

1209
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,000
That's the only thing.

1210
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,280
That makes it fair.

1211
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,220
You have to like...

1212
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,960
At least look at it.

1213
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,240
So you can't be like...

1214
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,480
360.

1215
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,540
Oh wait.

1216
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:52,880
I can.

1217
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,440
Haha.

1218
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,540
360.

1219
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I can be like...

1220
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,780
360.

1221
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,780
Oh shit.

1222
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,100
Okay.

1223
00:42:59,320 --> 00:42:59,360
Wait.

1224
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,120
I have to...

1225
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,580
360.

1226
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,460
Phew.

1227
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,480
Haha.

1228
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,260
I can do that.

1229
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,080
Haha.

1230
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,000
That'd be so PM.

1231
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,120
If you die from that.

1232
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,580
And nutting in 360.

1233
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,760
Oh my god.

1234
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,220
I did like a...

1235
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,440
Six...

1236
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,140
A nut.

1237
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:14,760
Eclipse.

1238
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,200
You have to just shoot the general direction.

1239
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,740
Yeah.

1240
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,800
The 360 nut.

1241
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,500
Haha.

1242
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,080
But that's like her...

1243
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,080
Basically the...

1244
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,340
The change that she has.

1245
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,120
Alright.

1246
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,400
What other things were different?

1247
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,420
What other things did they change?

1248
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,420
I could show you guys the...

1249
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,220
Oh my god.

1250
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,860
I forgot.

1251
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,080
The...

1252
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,800
The new character.

1253
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,640
Haha.

1254
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,180
Obviously.

1255
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,540
Oh yeah.

1256
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:39,820
No.

1257
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,560
Oh my god.

1258
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,200
It's so fast.

1259
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:41,660
Nevermind.

1260
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,560
This is...

1261
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,640
Point and click adventure.

1262
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,640
I told you guys, right?

1263
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:46,920
Um...

1264
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,320
I think Hela is the...

1265
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,720
Easiest DPS...

1266
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,480
Out there for...

1267
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,640
Uh...

1268
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,040
Is there falloff?

1269
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,660
Wait.

1270
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,480
Is there falloff?

1271
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,240
Actually?

1272
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,300
Okay.

1273
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,320
Can't catch me.

1274
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,040
Okay.

1275
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,540
I need to know.

1276
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,960
What's the falloff for this?

1277
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,500
Oh, it's not that...

1278
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:05,560
Bad.

1279
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:06,720
Oh no.

1280
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,540
She is like Hela.

1281
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:08,840
Oh.

1282
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:09,860
Hahaha.

1283
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:12,840
It...

1284
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,600
The falloff is not that bad.

1285
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,360
Not gonna lie.

1286
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:15,900
Wow.

1287
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,700
Four in a row.

1288
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,340
Yeah.

1289
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,100
It's not that...

1290
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,740
Like there is falloff, but it's...

1291
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,540
It's not that bad.

1292
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,540
Hahaha.

1293
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,880
This is a new Hela.

1294
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,820
This is actually Hela.

1295
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,760
Way to go!

1296
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,760
It's been like point and click adventure.

1297
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:28,700
Hahaha.

1298
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:29,880
Sorry.

1299
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,140
Hahaha.

1300
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,500
Oh my god.

1301
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,860
It's been a while since I played.

1302
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,360
I just need to like...

1303
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:38,680
Practice again.

1304
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,320
Because...

1305
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:39,420
Guys.

1306
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,100
It's been a while since I've played...

1307
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:41,500
Hahaha.

1308
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,560
I've played it.

1309
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,740
Video games.

1310
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,560
Hahaha.

1311
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,060
But...

1312
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:47,380
Err.

1313
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,580
You've been judged.

1314
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,960
Um...

1315
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,460
If I like...

1316
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,760
If I actually warmed up...

1317
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,520
I think it'd be fine.

1318
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,380
But I have not warmed up at all.

1319
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,120
Hahaha.

1320
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,480
It's basically Hela.

1321
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,400
And Hela...

1322
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,720
If you can aim...

1323
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,960
This is like...

1324
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,460
Pretty easy.

1325
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,560
And it has like blasts too.

1326
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,600
Like the fact that like...

1327
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,980
I remember when she was a fucking telekinesis girl.

1328
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:08,580
Hahaha.

1329
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,020
Hahaha.

1330
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,800
You've been judged.

1331
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:11,620
And then there...

1332
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,300
People were like...

1333
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,600
And then Marvel was like...

1334
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,840
There's too many psychic people.

1335
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,580
We gotta give her something else.

1336
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,820
But her damage is...

1337
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,980
Insane actually.

1338
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,240
Now that I think about it.

1339
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,300
Um...

1340
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,900
I'm sure hope they don't add more ways to beat me senseless.

1341
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,460
In less than two seconds.

1342
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,440
Or...

1343
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,700
Thank you with the super chat.

1344
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,180
Thank you.

1345
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:29,960
Thank you.

1346
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,780
Hahaha.

1347
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,620
Remember when all she did was move...

1348
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,040
Uh...

1349
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,620
Was just read people's minds?

1350
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,860
That wasn't cool enough.

1351
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,180
Let's give her fire powers.

1352
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,460
Hahaha.

1353
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,100
Did she get two shot?

1354
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:42,640
A headshot?

1355
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:43,880
Yeah.

1356
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,380
So it's Hela.

1357
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,060
She's literally Hela.

1358
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,300
Now imagine if someone else also shot at that person.

1359
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,520
I imagine two pro aimers with Phoenix.

1360
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:51,900
Hela.

1361
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,860
Okay, the other team.

1362
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,720
Lord help us.

1363
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:54,180
Hahaha.

1364
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,720
Like...

1365
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:56,960
Like...

1366
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,080
It's literally just Hela.

1367
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,240
But her...

1368
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,040
Her project...

1369
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,800
Uh...

1370
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,680
It's not even a projectile.

1371
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,120
I think this is...

1372
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,860
Is this hitscan?

1373
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,480
Is this too fast?

1374
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,500
It feels really fast for her.

1375
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,040
It feels really fast for projectile.

1376
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,920
Yeah, it does more damage.

1377
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,320
Of course.

1378
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,420
Is it projectile?

1379
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:17,880
It hitscan.

1380
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,660
Cause it feels...

1381
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,880
It feels like hitscan.

1382
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:21,760
Like...

1383
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,640
The fact that it's faster than Hela is like insane.

1384
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,300
Cause like...

1385
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:26,700
Her...

1386
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,400
Her...

1387
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,940
She's already...

1388
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,560
Hela was already super fucking easy.

1389
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,400
Hahaha.

1390
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,540
And then you have like...

1391
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,520
Okay, so how...

1392
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,300
Cause like...

1393
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,300
Gene has...

1394
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,120
Really?

1395
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,420
You know, I would love to have a teleporting ability as a support.

1396
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,200
That would be pretty cool if you think that.

1397
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:42,900
Hahaha.

1398
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,680
But no.

1399
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,400
Give it to Gene.

1400
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,100
Haha.

1401
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,680
But like...

1402
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,040
You know how Hela has the bird?

1403
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,660
So Gene Gray has...

1404
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,260
Um...

1405
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,100
Yeah, she has this.

1406
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,720
She has two fucking...

1407
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,300
What the fuck?

1408
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,040
She's so greedy!

1409
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,160
She...

1410
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,260
She's like...

1411
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:57,840
No, I want more.

1412
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,300
No, I want it all.

1413
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,960
She's so fucking greedy.

1414
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:01,840
Oh my god.

1415
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,980
She has the fly.

1416
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,820
And then she has her...

1417
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,440
Stupid...

1418
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,140
She has this.

1419
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,980
So she actually has the teleport that...

1420
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,760
And her ship...

1421
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,320
Her ship makes it so that...

1422
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,640
The ship...

1423
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,800
It makes it that it explodes.

1424
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,620
So I can literally do like...

1425
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,320
Can't catch me!

1426
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,380
I can like do this...

1427
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,520
And then...

1428
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,540
Teleport away.

1429
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,700
Oh my...

1430
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,500
Her greed sickens me!

1431
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,620
Her...

1432
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,120
Hahaha.

1433
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:25,600
Hahaha.

1434
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,940
I can feel your pain.

1435
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,540
Sorry.

1436
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,340
What the...

1437
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,400
What can Adam do?

1438
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,960
Adam can just walk...

1439
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,720
Can just walk away.

1440
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:33,780
Like...

1441
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,580
Oh my god!

1442
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,120
Her greed...

1443
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,100
Why does she have two escape abilities?

1444
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,560
That's...

1445
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:40,920
Hahaha.

1446
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,500
That's so fucked up.

1447
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,840
Let's just notice that.

1448
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,120
She has two fucking escape abilities.

1449
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,960
Holy shit.

1450
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,240
And just...

1451
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,680
Just walk away.

1452
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,740
Alright.

1453
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,720
Bro, they like broke his legs.

1454
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,700
Cause they're like, You're not allowed to have friends anymore.

1455
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,320
And then...

1456
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:00,640
Uh...

1457
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,320
I've seen enough...

1458
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,200
Nerf Adam's mobility.

1459
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,320
Hahaha.

1460
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,380
No, they're like...

1461
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:07,740
Hahaha.

1462
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,500
They're like...

1463
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,060
They're like, You know what?

1464
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,300
You can't even have friends, Adam.

1465
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,040
We're nerfing Rose Cop.

1466
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,540
No more friends for you.

1467
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,500
And then they went and buffed Mantis?

1468
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,200
Hahaha.

1469
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:21,780
So yeah.

1470
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,580
By the way.

1471
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,440
Mantis got a little buff, so...

1472
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,540
She does more healing now.

1473
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,620
Um...

1474
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,500
They're like...

1475
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,080
You don't deserve friends.

1476
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,720
Hahaha.

1477
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:30,920
Hahaha.

1478
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,140
I'm mad.

1479
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,660
They hate him so much.

1480
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:36,820
Hahaha.

1481
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,660
Um...

1482
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,060
Um...

1483
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,980
I just know that...

1484
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,040
Her healing...

1485
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:42,400
Like...

1486
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,960
Her healing increased too.

1487
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:44,740
Uh...

1488
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,220
And Sue has more healing as well.

1489
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:46,480
Yeah.

1490
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,680
Um...

1491
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,060
What the fuck does Adam have?

1492
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,280
I mean...

1493
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,940
He doesn't have anything.

1494
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:52,880
Um...

1495
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,100
Oh yeah.

1496
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,720
I wanted to try out...

1497
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,560
I wanna try out the Wolverine life steal real quick.

1498
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:57,880
Okay.

1499
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,160
So...

1500
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,420
I don't play Wolverine.

1501
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,100
So...

1502
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,780
I don't remember...

1503
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,080
Oh, I need to get damage first.

1504
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,200
I don't play Wolverine.

1505
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,880
But I just wanna see the life steal.

1506
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:07,600
In general.

1507
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:08,740
He's the...

1508
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:08,880
Yeah.

1509
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,320
He's the middle child.

1510
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,420
Alright.

1511
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,320
Hahaha.

1512
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:14,600
Okay.

1513
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,180
So...

1514
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,140
How do I activate it?

1515
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,560
How do you activate the...

1516
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:23,660
Oh!

1517
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,200
There we go.

1518
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:24,520
Oh!

1519
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:24,820
Okay.

1520
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,240
Wow!

1521
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,360
Whoa!

1522
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:26,860
Whoa!

1523
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:28,800
Nevermind.

1524
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,540
I see.

1525
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,300
I see now.

1526
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,900
No, I see it now.

1527
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,780
Oh, whoa.

1528
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,620
It's the shift.

1529
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,300
It's the shift.

1530
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:34,640
Yeah.

1531
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,300
Uh...

1532
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,020
Oh, bring the game down a little bit?

1533
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:41,300
Sure.

1534
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,180
I can do that.

1535
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,680
Uh...

1536
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,100
It...

1537
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:47,420
It...

1538
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:47,680
Okay.

1539
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,600
The thing is...

1540
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,700
Imagine like...

1541
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,600
You broke the guy's...

1542
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,140
Uh...

1543
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:52,780
Passive.

1544
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,000
And then he has life steal after that.

1545
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,580
Can you try on a tank?

1546
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,140
Oh, yeah.

1547
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,980
Let me grab a tank real quick.

1548
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,820
Can I like...

1549
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,900
Do it from here?

1550
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,120
Like...

1551
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,620
Give me a tank.

1552
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,840
No, I can't spawn a tank from here.

1553
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,340
Alright.

1554
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,820
Let me grab this here.

1555
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,040
Alright.

1556
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,160
Alright, thing.

1557
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,900
Wait, I can't grab him.

1558
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,260
Okay.

1559
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,280
Alright, Groot.

1560
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:15,780
It's time.

1561
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,860
Alright.

1562
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:17,920
It's time, Groot.

1563
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,400
It's time.

1564
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,480
Yeah!

1565
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,480
And then...

1566
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,020
I don't know.

1567
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,060
Yay!

1568
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,640
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1569
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,680
And I'm full HP now.

1570
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,020
Goodbye.

1571
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,220
Now imagine if I grab two people.

1572
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,440
Cause like...

1573
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,040
That's life stealing from one guy.

1574
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,180
And usually Wolverine...

1575
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,140
Wolverines can grab like several people too.

1576
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,320
Oh my god.

1577
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,280
If he like...

1578
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:41,840
Ults too?

1579
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,460
Oh, that shit would be crazy.

1580
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,000
That shit would actually be crazy.

1581
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,280
And I'm not even a Wolverine player.

1582
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,560
I think Wolverine might get banned.

1583
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,300
It's like...

1584
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,760
He seems really strong with...

1585
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,240
The...

1586
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,660
The Phoenix team up.

1587
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,380
Alright.

1588
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:56,820
Uh...

1589
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,020
What else do I wanna try out?

1590
00:50:59,420 --> 00:50:59,940
Uh...

1591
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,700
Oh yeah.

1592
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,580
I wanna try our ult.

1593
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,460
Go back to...

1594
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,540
The...

1595
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,540
Gene real quick.

1596
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,540
It's...

1597
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:07,840
Okay.

1598
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,260
So her ult...

1599
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,120
Weeeeee!

1600
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:11,880
Yeah.

1601
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:12,680
There you are.

1602
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,460
Alright.

1603
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,760
So...

1604
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,620
Apparently her ult has no range.

1605
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,760
You are nothing!

1606
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,400
Weeeeee!

1607
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,020
Okay.

1608
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,620
How far can I go though?

1609
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,960
Oh my god.

1610
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,440
I can dive bomb so fucking far.

1611
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:28,940
Okay.

1612
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,780
Give me...

1613
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,240
Give me her...

1614
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:32,660
Alright.

1615
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,160
Let's see.

1616
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,500
How far can I go?

1617
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,180
I'm curious.

1618
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,460
You are nothing!

1619
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:36,840
Okay.

1620
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,560
As long as I can see where they are.

1621
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:39,760
Weeeee!

1622
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,400
Okay.

1623
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,060
Okay.

1624
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,300
I need to make sure I don't land on structures.

1625
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:43,640
Alright.

1626
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,080
That's good.

1627
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,440
I was wondering if I can...

1628
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,300
If I like get...

1629
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,400
If I TP through the structures.

1630
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,000
That's why I did that.

1631
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,400
Because I was curious how broken that is.

1632
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,400
So like...

1633
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,320
As long as like...

1634
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,180
I'm in the air.

1635
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,920
And then...

1636
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,560
Weeeee!

1637
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,180
Okay.

1638
00:51:59,340 --> 00:51:59,460
Yeah.

1639
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,000
There's no actual range.

1640
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:01,760
There's no actual range.

1641
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,440
I have to actually...

1642
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:02,520
Oh!

1643
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,100
And I...

1644
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,240
It TP's me back?

1645
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,460
Wait.

1646
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:06,940
What?

1647
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,320
Oh!

1648
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,120
So I...

1649
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,200
Dive bomb?

1650
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,100
I can like...

1651
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:12,580
Oh!

1652
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,540
So I'd be safe.

1653
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,540
I'd just...

1654
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,040
Be back.

1655
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,220
Oh!

1656
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,080
So like...

1657
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,840
It doesn't...

1658
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,080
Yeah.

1659
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,220
So it's a safe ult.

1660
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:20,820
So like...

1661
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,660
I don't risk anything.

1662
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,660
At all.

1663
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,180
You've been judged.

1664
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:24,340
Yeah.

1665
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:24,980
And...

1666
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,220
Oh!

1667
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,060
That's interesting.

1668
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,680
That's actually interesting.

1669
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,200
Like...

1670
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,460
I can literally be like...

1671
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:30,660
Here.

1672
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,840
And then like...

1673
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:33,940
Huh.

1674
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:34,800
Goodbye.

1675
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,500
And then I can be back home.

1676
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:39,480
Oh!

1677
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,220
It's...

1678
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,320
The third...

1679
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,240
The third escape ability!

1680
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,500
I've seen too much.

1681
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,300
You know what?

1682
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,400
I think Adam should do less damage.

1683
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,540
Like...

1684
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,140
I've seen too much, guys.

1685
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:57,700
Oh!

1686
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,780
I forgot about her right click.

1687
00:52:59,360 --> 00:52:59,900
Um...

1688
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,580
You know...

1689
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,080
I'm like super...

1690
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,720
You can just...

1691
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,840
Fly around with her like...

1692
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,540
Time to nerf Adam again.

1693
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:09,880
Oh!

1694
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,420
Shit!

1695
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,200
Okay.

1696
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,160
Oh!

1697
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,260
She seems so broken.

1698
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,080
The more I'm playing around with her...

1699
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:15,500
Oh!

1700
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,340
I can shoot the...

1701
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:16,380
Oh!

1702
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:16,600
Okay.

1703
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,460
That's good to know.

1704
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,840
That's good to know that you can shoot it.

1705
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,440
Cause I was gonna say...

1706
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:21,800
Like...

1707
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,940
Do you really need more?

1708
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,580
Yeah.

1709
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,460
She has the right click.

1710
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,520
So the right click basically...

1711
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,200
Okay.

1712
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,280
I'm going to...

1713
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,400
Uh...

1714
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,480
Also I brought the game volume down a little bit.

1715
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,980
So let me know that's better sound guy.

1716
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,320
So basically...

1717
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:34,760
It like...

1718
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,200
It does like damage...

1719
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:37,880
Holy shit.

1720
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,100
Wait.

1721
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:38,460
What?

1722
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,200
It moves?

1723
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:40,780
It moves...

1724
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,480
Oh my...

1725
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:43,700
Okay.

1726
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,920
I didn't realize that.

1727
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,980
I thought it would just stay there.

1728
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,300
Okay.

1729
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,680
It's like a ballistic missile coming.

1730
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:50,500
Oh!

1731
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,620
It moves forward.

1732
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,400
Oh my god.

1733
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:52,740
Okay.

1734
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:53,540
So...

1735
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,940
I can like...

1736
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,920
Farm so much shit.

1737
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:56,720
On like...

1738
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,620
Tanks that are just walking.

1739
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,000
Oh that's cool.

1740
00:53:59,580 --> 00:53:59,840
Oh my god.

1741
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,300
Bro.

1742
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:00,980
What the fuck?

1743
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:01,700
Hahaha.

1744
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,460
Holy...

1745
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:04,760
Okay.

1746
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,740
I think they're nerfing her.

1747
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,520
I think they're gonna nerf her on launch.

1748
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,260
There's no way.

1749
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,200
She has too much.

1750
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,220
This one of these team up as a tank play.

1751
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,500
I guess suffering is always a...

1752
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,400
I told you guys.

1753
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,740
All tank players are just masochists.

1754
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:18,760
Look at this.

1755
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,740
But speaking of tank.

1756
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,440
At least you guys can like...

1757
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,620
Jump up.

1758
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:23,860
Now.

1759
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,420
What is it?

1760
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,360
You guys can be like...

1761
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,560
Look.

1762
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,500
Watch this.

1763
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,680
I can be like...

1764
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,940
You know what?

1765
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,620
Fuck you.

1766
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:29,940
Wait.

1767
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,560
What was it?

1768
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,540
Was it like...

1769
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,280
I don't remember which jump it was.

1770
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,160
It was like...

1771
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,120
A particular jump.

1772
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,720
What jump was it that makes it so you can like...

1773
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,920
Jump up into a flyer?

1774
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,360
And like...

1775
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:41,880
Smack them.

1776
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:42,800
Like...

1777
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,280
Hahaha.

1778
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,600
Is it Eb?

1779
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,100
Okay.

1780
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,180
You guys can now...

1781
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:46,640
Like...

1782
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,060
If they have a flyer...

1783
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,300
You can just like...

1784
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,260
Jump up to them now.

1785
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,160
So...

1786
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,240
Poop poop.

1787
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:53,660
Pew pew.

1788
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,840
It's like you swat them down.

1789
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,480
Poop poop.

1790
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,100
Boop poop.

1791
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,020
But like...

1792
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,640
That's really it.

1793
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:58,500
Hahaha.

1794
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,820
You're so greedy.

1795
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,660
Why do you want more?

1796
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:03,580
Anyway.

1797
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,080
She seems too weak now.

1798
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:06,820
We should like...

1799
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,220
Give her a forfeitscape ability.

1800
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,000
Uh...

1801
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,280
Hahaha.

1802
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,260
Hahaha.

1803
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,200
He should...

1804
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:15,800
Uh...

1805
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,260
Have to time...

1806
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,720
Oh, you have to time the right click.

1807
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:19,840
Hahaha.

1808
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:20,360
Hahaha.

1809
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,400
Alright.

1810
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,240
She's not broken.

1811
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,040
She's just lore accurate.

1812
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:25,480
Guys.

1813
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,280
Alright.

1814
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,240
I can't wait to play.

1815
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,960
I can't wait to fight for Jean.

1816
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:29,420
Okay, wait.

1817
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,060
We gotta figure out.

1818
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:30,500
Alright.

1819
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,420
When we load in...

1820
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:31,980
Where is she?

1821
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,940
Oh my gosh.

1822
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:33,740
She's all the way there.

1823
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:34,260
Okay.

1824
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,220
I could be like...

1825
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,260
I have to like...

1826
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:36,940
Be so fast.

1827
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,620
Because I think everyone's gonna be playing her.

1828
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,300
I...

1829
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:39,780
Hahaha.

1830
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,120
Okay.

1831
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:42,860
Alright.

1832
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,060
Is there anything else to check out, guys?

1833
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,040
Before I...

1834
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,100
Play quick play.

1835
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,380
And check out the new map.

1836
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,040
Wait.

1837
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,520
Actually, we should check out the new map.

1838
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,360
Uh...

1839
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:52,940
On custom.

1840
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,300
I already looked...

1841
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:54,920
I think...

1842
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,360
Uh...

1843
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,000
Go healer next scroll.

1844
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,160
We need...

1845
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:00,900
You know what?

1846
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,660
I've seen enough.

1847
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,320
We gotta remove Adam's legs.

1848
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:03,980
I...

1849
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,460
Hahaha.

1850
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,640
I still can't believe they were like...

1851
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,220
At the nerf rest cop.

1852
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,840
If you're like, Adam, you don't deserve friends.

1853
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:11,580
Hahaha.

1854
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,580
They like buffed Mantis instead of buffing Adam.

1855
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,080
That's so fucked up.

1856
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,160
Hahaha.

1857
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:19,780
Hahaha.

1858
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:21,540
Hahaha.

1859
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:21,840
Alright.

1860
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,060
Um...

1861
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,000
Remove his ability.

1862
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,740
You're right, guys.

1863
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:27,520
You know what?

1864
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,220
He should...

1865
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,640
He should just start crawling.

1866
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:30,720
Uh...

1867
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,320
Alright.

1868
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,240
Let's look at the new map, Tim.

1869
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,640
Hahaha.

1870
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,280
Because legless.

1871
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,040
Okay.

1872
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,440
Um...

1873
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,340
Hmm...

1874
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:40,580
Alright.

1875
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,840
So there is a new map.

1876
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,960
Let's be friends.

1877
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,760
Hahaha.

1878
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,280
That was so simple.

1879
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,420
Thank you for the rain.

1880
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:47,940
Thank you.

1881
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,560
Thank you.

1882
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,260
Alright.

1883
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,100
Create game.

1884
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,700
No one's allowed in my game.

1885
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,020
Lock room.

1886
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:53,980
Alright.

1887
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,440
Uh...

1888
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,440
I don't know.

1889
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:00,820
I don't know.

1890
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,940
I mean, no one's gonna be in here anyway.

1891
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:02,960
Hahaha.

1892
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:03,380
I just...

1893
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,660
I don't even know my own password.

1894
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,500
Alright.

1895
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,100
Let's see.

1896
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:06,600
What...

1897
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,920
What mode is it anyway?

1898
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,400
It is a...

1899
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,560
Not that.

1900
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,200
What's it called?

1901
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,960
Wait, what the fuck is it called?

1902
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,120
Wait, what is the new map called?

1903
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,640
Oh, it's Haven.

1904
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,280
Is it not in?

1905
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:25,480
No.

1906
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,320
Oh, it's Klyntar.

1907
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:26,740
Right?

1908
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,340
It's Klyntar.

1909
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,980
Oh, it's a domination map.

1910
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:30,280
Okay.

1911
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,020
Alright.

1912
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,080
Let's look at Klyntar real quick.

1913
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,560
It's the last one.

1914
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:38,840
Alright.

1915
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,320
Before we go into quick play.

1916
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,100
I wanna see the map.

1917
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,440
Pick your hero or villain.

1918
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,200
I'm not judging.

1919
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:43,620
Okay.

1920
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,240
It doesn't...

1921
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:44,340
Okay.

1922
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,320
Which is the fastest?

1923
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,680
I guess like...

1924
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:46,940
Star-Lord.

1925
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,820
Star-Lord to fly around.

1926
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,200
Yeah.

1927
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,500
Klyntar is the newest map.

1928
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:52,680
Also...

1929
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:52,920
Borat.

1930
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,380
Thank you for the one gifted ship.

1931
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:54,740
Thank you.

1932
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,380
Thank you.

1933
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:55,920
Super.

1934
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,900
Thank you for the super chat.

1935
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:57,280
Thank you.

1936
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:57,980
Thank you.

1937
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,440
Oh, just a bit more.

1938
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,900
Was it too loud earlier, guys?

1939
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,260
Um...

1940
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,760
Earlier, we were playing around sound settings.

1941
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:08,720
Um...

1942
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,700
We were playing around sa...

1943
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,720
Like, my mic settings.

1944
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,560
Uh...

1945
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,400
With the sound team.

1946
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,040
So, uh...

1947
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,640
My sound settings might be like...

1948
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,480
Fucked up for a bit.

1949
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,200
Hahaha!

1950
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:19,600
Alright.

1951
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,000
Okay.

1952
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:23,820
It looks like...

1953
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,300
This map looks like...

1954
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,880
Um...

1955
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,420
What was that other map?

1956
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,480
The other map that I fucking hate.

1957
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,560
Because it was just...

1958
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,800
Basically looks like this.

1959
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:32,740
Uh...

1960
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,080
It looks like...

1961
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,660
This map makes my skin crawl every time.

1962
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,260
Oh, wait.

1963
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:37,700
Iron Man.

1964
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,100
You're right.

1965
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,220
I should just play Iron Man.

1966
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:40,980
You're right.

1967
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,140
At least I can float around.

1968
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,100
It looks like the...

1969
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:45,620
Um...

1970
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,100
The other map that I fucking hate.

1971
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,020
Hahaha!

1972
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,180
It looks...

1973
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,320
Wait.

1974
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,560
It's literally just that map.

1975
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:52,840
Wait.

1976
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,760
This is that map.

1977
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,540
What the fuck?

1978
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:54,660
One.

1979
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,080
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

1980
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,760
Wait.

1981
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,800
There is this map.

1982
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,500
There is!

1983
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,340
Yeah.

1984
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,960
They just like got rid of the cart.

1985
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,040
It's the same planet.

1986
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:09,780
Ugh.

1987
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:10,700
I hate this area.

1988
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,020
Okay.

1989
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:11,580
I don't like...

1990
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,440
I don't like this map.

1991
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,200
I'm gonna say it.

1992
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,100
Because like...

1993
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,340
It just reminds me of the other map that I hate.

1994
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,800
I'm going in with pre...

1995
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,660
Pre-hate.

1996
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:20,320
I...

1997
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:20,880
Hahaha!

1998
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,260
I'm going in...

1999
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,100
I'm going in with pre-hate.

2000
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,640
The fuck is this DNA shit?

2001
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,720
Up here.

2002
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,520
Why is your DNA here?

2003
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,100
Alright.

2004
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:29,780
Hahaha!

2005
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,840
I'm going in with prejudice against this place.

2006
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:35,880
I don't know.

2007
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,120
It just feels like...

2008
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:38,600
Uh...

2009
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,680
Predeterminate.

2010
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,620
I already hate the first Venom map anyway.

2011
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,320
Uh...

2012
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:45,760
Oh my god.

2013
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,720
I'm here to get DNA.

2014
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,020
Is there like anything different?

2015
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:49,640
You're in control.

2016
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,260
That shows up?

2017
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,780
I don't know.

2018
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,200
Uh...

2019
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,720
Doesn't seem like...

2020
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,600
That special.

2021
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,260
Environmentally.

2022
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,160
I think it's just cause like...

2023
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,060
Corko...

2024
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,140
Corko...

2025
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,120
Corko...

2026
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,280
Corkoa was like...

2027
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,320
Super...

2028
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:07,380
Super...

2029
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:07,760
Detailed.

2030
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:08,720
And like...

2031
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,800
It was such a new area.

2032
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:10,340
And as well.

2033
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,600
That like...

2034
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,460
Seeing this is a little underwhelming.

2035
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:14,960
Just because it's like...

2036
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,220
You know...

2037
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:15,500
They just...

2038
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,140
It's like...

2039
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:16,960
The same planet.

2040
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,680
And it feels like...

2041
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,280
It feels like very...

2042
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:21,840
Uh...

2043
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,600
What's it called?

2044
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,780
It feels very samesy.

2045
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:24,520
Okay.

2046
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,660
These are the things you can break.

2047
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:25,960
Oh.

2048
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:26,660
I can break this.

2049
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,340
Uh...

2050
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,300
It feels just a little underwhelming.

2051
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,480
Just because like...

2052
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,560
We just got...

2053
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:33,740
Like...

2054
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,620
Krakoa was a...

2055
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,240
We got Krakoa and the...

2056
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,240
The other map wasn't...

2057
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,380
I didn't like the...

2058
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:39,820
What was it?

2059
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,160
The one with the...

2060
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:41,780
Roots and stuff?

2061
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:43,840
Alright.

2062
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,620
I wonder what the second cycle is.

2063
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,240
Keep going!

2064
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,220
Yeah.

2065
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,480
This feels a little boring.

2066
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,140
Alright.

2067
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,360
Come on.

2068
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,360
Speed it up, guys.

2069
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,480
I think it's just the colors.

2070
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,500
I think the colors...

2071
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,220
And the fact that I...

2072
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,520
I fucking hate the other one.

2073
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,200
I...

2074
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:04,600
I don't know.

2075
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:04,940
I just...

2076
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,120
I never liked that...

2077
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:06,700
Other map.

2078
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,300
For it.

2079
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,500
The first map for this...

2080
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:08,940
Planet.

2081
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,760
Because it's like the...

2082
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,040
Little black goo's.

2083
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:12,680
These things.

2084
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,800
Little black goo shit.

2085
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,160
And also like...

2086
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,740
Um...

2087
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,060
I don't know.

2088
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,600
I just never liked that map in general.

2089
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,040
When I...

2090
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,620
To play it.

2091
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,780
They're like...

2092
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,680
I'm already coming in with predetermined hate.

2093
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,080
I'm...

2094
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,540
I'm already...

2095
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,740
I'm already coming with prejudice right now.

2096
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,820
I wonder if there's any like goo that you can...

2097
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,200
You can break that.

2098
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,860
You can break all of this.

2099
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,060
Alright.

2100
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,460
I don't know what the new area is.

2101
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,140
Yay!

2102
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,040
I got DNA!

2103
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,140
Okay, Celestial Vulp.

2104
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:53,900
Alright.

2105
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,760
What does the Celestial Vulp grant me?

2106
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:02,630
If I'm not joking about something, you know I'm not taking it seriously.

2107
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:04,450
Okay.

2108
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,990
Oh, it just looks the same.

2109
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:12,350
This just looks like the starting area for...

2110
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:12,970
The...

2111
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:13,690
The first map.

2112
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:15,310
30 seconds before you attack.

2113
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:16,230
Get ready.

2114
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,310
This looks the same.

2115
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:21,630
What change?

2116
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:22,010
Yeah.

2117
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:22,790
I'm like...

2118
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:23,210
What change?

2119
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:26,130
I guess...

2120
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,310
I guess cause like, you know...

2121
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:29,730
Um...

2122
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:31,050
Um...

2123
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,010
It's like, you know...

2124
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,110
This battle pass is like Venom themed.

2125
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,730
So it makes sense to like, make it more so like...

2126
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:39,210
You know, lots of Venom related things here.

2127
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,390
But they are the same picture.

2128
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,430
I can't tell what's different, guys.

2129
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,130
I actually can't tell.

2130
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:48,290
Weeeeee!

2131
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:50,370
Weeeeee!

2132
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,250
Weeeeee!

2133
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,310
Okay, so...

2134
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,850
It looks like the same from...

2135
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:55,370
I don't know.

2136
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:58,350
It feels very similar to...

2137
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,010
It feels very similar to the first stage.

2138
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:05,590
Okay, there's Hello.

2139
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:09,710
Hello, hello!

2140
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,670
It looks like the mission area...

2141
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,110
Yeah, just a little blend.

2142
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:17,810
I agree.

2143
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,270
What's destructible?

2144
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:22,450
Not a lot!

2145
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:22,770
Wait.

2146
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:23,770
Wait a minute.

2147
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:25,930
Wait.

2148
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:26,990
What?

2149
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:27,910
Really?

2150
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,170
Oh!

2151
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:32,030
Oh, that's interesting.

2152
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:35,030
Not a lot is destructible here.

2153
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:39,530
This?

2154
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:41,430
What the fuck is that gonna do to me?

2155
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,750
Oh, that's interesting.

2156
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:51,030
Usually, usually, like, more things are destructible, so the fact that, like...

2157
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:53,550
I guess, like, the entrance?

2158
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,370
But, like, what the fuck are you gonna do here?

2159
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,290
That's, like, literally their spawn.

2160
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:59,650
Yeah, I'm just, like, thinking.

2161
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,430
This is, like, their spawn.

2162
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:02,830
Natani!

2163
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,210
Oh, no, Doki, be careful!

2164
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,390
You're gonna stub your toe!

2165
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,670
Like that!

2166
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,190
Don't worry, I got you.

2167
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,150
I got that spike out of the way.

2168
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:14,590
Don't worry, Doki.

2169
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:22,490
Oh, is it the sword talking to me?

2170
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:23,550
Oh, shit!

2171
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,310
It is!

2172
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,450
Oh, it's the sword talking to me.

2173
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:33,350
Yeah, there's not a lot of destructibles here, which I'm very surprised.

2174
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:34,950
Because usually, there's, like...

2175
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:36,550
There should be more.

2176
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,310
Like, I think I just broke one spike and that was it.

2177
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:44,270
Uh...

2178
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:45,370
Alright.

2179
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:47,530
Maximum pulse!

2180
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:48,270
Woo!

2181
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,650
Okay, so I got rid of that tree.

2182
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:52,890
But it's, like, I don't know.

2183
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:53,330
There's no...

2184
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:55,710
It doesn't seem like there's a point in destroying any of these.

2185
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,390
Just because, like...

2186
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,470
All of this seems like...

2187
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:01,410
You have to be in their spawn to get this.

2188
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:04,690
The talking sword.

2189
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,950
Yeah, but they have a talking sword, Doki!

2190
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,330
10 out of 10!

2191
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:12,530
Alright.

2192
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:13,850
I like how...

2193
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:14,870
Oh, yeah, because it's a...

2194
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:17,030
Like, a cat and mouse.

2195
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,470
You just run around.

2196
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:23,910
It was, like, a 1v1 and then you just run around the sword in the middle.

2197
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:27,970
Oh, you're right.

2198
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,670
I guess, like, Rocket could climb and...

2199
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:30,670
And...

2200
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:31,530
Could climb on that.

2201
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,430
Alright, let's see if we get the Celestia...

2202
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,250
Uh, hand.

2203
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,410
Also, Headhunter!

2204
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:36,330
Thank you for the raid!

2205
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:36,710
Thank you!

2206
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:37,450
Thank you!

2207
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:39,930
I appreciate it!

2208
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:40,750
Thank you so much!

2209
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:46,920
Alright.

2210
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:47,960
I wanna see the...

2211
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,620
Maybe the...

2212
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:50,660
Um...

2213
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,280
The third zone would be different.

2214
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:52,860
Alright.

2215
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,020
I hope I get the third zone.

2216
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,460
Celestia Husk.

2217
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,000
Pick your hero!

2218
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:57,580
Wait, no.

2219
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,140
I don't know...

2220
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,280
I don't know what that was.

2221
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:02,620
What was it called?

2222
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,860
What was the third zone called, guys?

2223
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,220
I don't remember what it was called.

2224
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,380
Maybe the third one will be different.

2225
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,440
Is this the first zone?

2226
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,400
Okay, we'll just immediately end match.

2227
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:17,560
Okay.

2228
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,720
This round is invalid.

2229
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:25,150
Okay, it's called Celestia Hand.

2230
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:28,570
Still capture the Celestia Husk?

2231
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:31,330
Or maybe when you get in, it's different, right?

2232
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:32,370
Maybe.

2233
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,010
I have no idea.

2234
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,610
I'm gonna see if I get in, and if it's a different zone.

2235
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:38,630
Cause I don't know.

2236
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,960
I wish I could pick the...

2237
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,080
Yeah, I wish...

2238
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:45,480
They add...

2239
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,020
They do add a lot of, like...

2240
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:50,480
Quality of Life stuff changes every half season.

2241
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,540
So maybe...

2242
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,820
Later on, you can pick it during custom...

2243
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:54,600
I guess, like...

2244
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,260
Oh, there it is!

2245
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:56,840
It's different?

2246
01:06:58,620 --> 01:06:59,300
Oh, yeah!

2247
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,300
This is the inside.

2248
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,080
Yeah, there it is.

2249
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:04,780
Okay.

2250
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,560
Okay, this looks different.

2251
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:07,540
Okay, I like this.

2252
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,680
You can see the little Phoenix stuff, too.

2253
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,020
I like this area.

2254
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,100
Yeah.

2255
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:13,060
Okay.

2256
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,340
I like that.

2257
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:16,880
This is different.

2258
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:17,820
It's different colors.

2259
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,480
Oh!

2260
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,180
Okay, see?

2261
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,340
Look, this is nice.

2262
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,380
Look, see?

2263
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,520
They have, like, weapons and stuff.

2264
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,160
They have, like, magma swords.

2265
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,180
Yeah, this is actually, like...

2266
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,360
Something fresh and new.

2267
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:30,920
It's actually, like...

2268
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:31,460
They add...

2269
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,400
Okay, I know what's expected to say.

2270
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,100
But the red actually adds a different color palette.

2271
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,240
There's actually a different color palette because they added red.

2272
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,560
Okay, that's destructible.

2273
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,180
Oh, okay.

2274
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,300
That's destructible.

2275
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,180
Alright, that's interesting.

2276
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,260
Okay, yeah.

2277
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,060
Okay, I like this.

2278
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:52,900
The third...

2279
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,060
Wait!

2280
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:53,960
The third one's nice!

2281
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,720
Wait, the third one's actually really good!

2282
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,760
Okay, this map is cool.

2283
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,240
Alright.

2284
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,440
This is actually different from the first two.

2285
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,900
Yeah, and then they have this area for flankers.

2286
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:04,800
Too.

2287
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,420
What can I destroy?

2288
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,720
Okay, so you can destroy this.

2289
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,700
Yeah, you can destroy more things here.

2290
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,340
You can add...

2291
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,500
Oh, and then you can destroy this.

2292
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,240
Yeah, like...

2293
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,160
I actually have stuff I can destroy.

2294
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:18,820
Alright.

2295
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,340
Like, obviously...

2296
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,440
And then there's, like, pathways.

2297
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,300
The third one stole all the budget.

2298
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,540
Yeah, and there's pathways on top.

2299
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,700
There's, like, the balcony here.

2300
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,300
It reminds me of that one...

2301
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,000
What Overwatch map is it?

2302
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,940
It reminds me of that one Overwatch map.

2303
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,020
Where you're also, like, in a factory setting.

2304
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,280
Where there's, like, a little balcony on top, too.

2305
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,180
Uh, does anything collapse?

2306
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,620
I don't think so.

2307
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:46,840
What is this?

2308
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,700
I don't think so.

2309
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,080
It's mostly just walls.

2310
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,700
Yeah, uh...

2311
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,900
Yeah, it's just walls.

2312
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,340
I don't think anything collapsed here.

2313
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,220
You can just make bigger...

2314
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,480
You can just make holes in the wall.

2315
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,260
I mean, get rid of this.

2316
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:03,640
That's not...

2317
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,420
I mean, that's sort of collapsible.

2318
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,120
He doesn't have, like, high ground anymore.

2319
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,240
No, no.

2320
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,220
It's the one where you're inside.

2321
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,900
And they have a little, like, balcony here.

2322
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,320
Similar to this map.

2323
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,520
Where, like, snipers can just aim...

2324
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,060
Like, not snipers, but you can just aim down.

2325
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,600
So you have to challenge high ground.

2326
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,180
I guess, like, when you win this point...

2327
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,960
You have to challenge high ground here.

2328
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,640
Because, like, that seems, like, scary in general.

2329
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:34,800
Um...

2330
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,340
Um...

2331
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:35,860
But yeah, no.

2332
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,840
I think this is...

2333
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,460
I think this is an interesting point.

2334
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,300
I like this point.

2335
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,680
And then they have this...

2336
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,100
Oh, look!

2337
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:41,920
There's, like...

2338
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,460
There's, like...

2339
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,800
Nothing growing inside there.

2340
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,260
Never mind.

2341
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,000
Oh, it's above me!

2342
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:47,500
Oh my god!

2343
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,760
There's a giant fucking egg!

2344
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:49,140
Okay.

2345
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,360
There's a...

2346
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,800
There's a giant egg in front of me.

2347
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,120
Oh, that's cute.

2348
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,920
Yeah, I like this.

2349
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,440
This is...

2350
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,740
This is an interesting map.

2351
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,180
Uh...

2352
01:09:59,180 --> 01:09:59,660
I look...

2353
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,460
I look down.

2354
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:01,420
Instead of...

2355
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:02,600
I'm looking up.

2356
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,580
I was like...

2357
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,660
Oh, there's nothing in here.

2358
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,680
Oh, there it is.

2359
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:06,280
Never mind.

2360
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,360
There's a giant fucking egg up here.

2361
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:12,560
Okay.

2362
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,560
I like this area.

2363
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,320
Alright.

2364
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:16,680
Alright.

2365
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,620
Now, let's try it.

2366
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,640
Let's see if we can get Gene.

2367
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,380
It's a draw?

2368
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,520
It's a draw?

2369
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,940
Gamers don't look up.

2370
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,080
Alright.

2371
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,040
Let's see if we can actually play Gene, chat.

2372
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,060
Oh, is that what it looks like when you lose?

2373
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,780
Oh, when you draw?

2374
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,620
Oh, that's cool.

2375
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,080
Yay!

2376
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,000
I'm MVP.

2377
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,320
I did nothing at all.

2378
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,080
Okay.

2379
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:45,800
Alright.

2380
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,000
Let's try a new map.

2381
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:48,680
MVP!

2382
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,400
Let's go!

2383
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,200
Uh...

2384
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:53,900
Alright.

2385
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:54,340
Celestial.

2386
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,260
I blew up some stuff, guys!

2387
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,380
MVP!

2388
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:00,380
MVP!

2389
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,180
Oh, bring game down a little bit more?

2390
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,820
I don't know if I did that already.

2391
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:08,960
But I'll do that again.

2392
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,140
Just in case.

2393
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,520
Sound guy, let me know.

2394
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,120
Let me know if everything's...

2395
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,340
Also, sound guy!

2396
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:19,020
We might have to redo our sound...

2397
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,300
Our game sound settings.

2398
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:24,360
For like, Elden Ring and Halo 2.

2399
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,760
Because of it.

2400
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,620
I have a faster internet than everybody.

2401
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:29,760
I have a...

2402
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,660
I have an SSD compared to everyone.

2403
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:37,840
Not only do I have a faster internet, but I also have an SS...

2404
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:38,900
SSD.

2405
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,080
Yeah, that's right.

2406
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,260
I literally...

2407
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,120
I'm pretty sure I loaded it instantly compared to everybody else.

2408
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:50,680
Alright.

2409
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,180
Like, it took them so long to pick one character.

2410
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,440
That's crazy.

2411
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,660
It actually took everybody so long.

2412
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:00,520
Alright.

2413
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,040
SSD different.

2414
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,520
Diff plus...

2415
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,520
Plus internet.

2416
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,020
Maybe it's just...

2417
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,240
No, cause like, audio settings all transfer over.

2418
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:15,300
Like, this is like, the usual audio settings I play with.

2419
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,320
That's some serious tech you're wearing there.

2420
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,140
It's more than just a pseudobot.

2421
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,100
They don't pick... No.

2422
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,440
Well, I mean like, first trap...

2423
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,520
Okay, so...

2424
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,840
My team isn't bots.

2425
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:24,280
I won't...

2426
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,480
I think it would most likely be like, the enemy team that are bots.

2427
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,480
But like, I don't think it's bots.

2428
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,420
I think it's just like...

2429
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,740
It's just actual like...

2430
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,500
It's actual players.

2431
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:36,320
I'm pretty sure.

2432
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:36,600
One.

2433
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,680
All you need to do is...

2434
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,320
Capture the mission agent.

2435
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,000
Wait.

2436
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,020
Okay, I need to like...

2437
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,120
Figure out what are the...

2438
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:45,780
Movement stuff.

2439
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,100
I don't know.

2440
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,020
Some of my...

2441
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,600
Every time I did early access...

2442
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,560
It hasn't been like...

2443
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:52,760
Ha!

2444
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:53,980
Jesus Christ.

2445
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:54,780
It is like...

2446
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:55,620
Oh,

2447
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:01,960
okay.

2448
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:02,240
Wait.

2449
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:06,740
Go ahead.

2450
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,280
Alright.

2451
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:13,740
Okay.

2452
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:14,840
Maybe they're bots.

2453
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,120
Okay.

2454
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:15,680
Nevermind.

2455
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,740
Maybe they're bots.

2456
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,400
Nevermind.

2457
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,820
But the way they're playing...

2458
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,200
They better be bots.

2459
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:26,980
This is sad.

2460
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,000
I don't know.

2461
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:30,860
I can't tell.

2462
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,500
I can't tell.

2463
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,020
Maybe you're right.

2464
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,100
I don't know.

2465
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:40,740
Hello.

2466
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:41,100
Yeah.

2467
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,860
It seems like...

2468
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:43,760
Okay.

2469
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,040
Now I hope they're bots.

2470
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,600
Cause this is sad.

2471
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,960
I think...

2472
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,100
My team is real though.

2473
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:55,780
I'm pretty...

2474
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,680
My team's real.

2475
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,680
Like this team is...

2476
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,280
Now I hope they are.

2477
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:04,160
Just...

2478
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,220
Cause that's embarrassing.

2479
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:07,080
Okay.

2480
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:07,660
I need to like...

2481
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:09,080
Figure out the range for this though.

2482
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,620
I'm like...

2483
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,800
Oh no.

2484
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:13,860
Wait.

2485
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:17,520
I can't land on this.

2486
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,000
I was like...

2487
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,080
Wait.

2488
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:22,180
There's so many...

2489
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,000
Oh there's way too many cover.

2490
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,900
I was like...

2491
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,360
Oh shit.

2492
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:26,980
I was like...

2493
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:29,880
Okay.

2494
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,280
There's not that all...

2495
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,960
I didn't know.

2496
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,660
I don't know this map.

2497
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,860
I didn't know how many trees there are.

2498
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,780
There's so many trees!

2499
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,080
There's so many trees!

2500
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:48,000
If this guy is real, I feel bad for him.

2501
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,660
Also him too.

2502
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:56,540
Okay.

2503
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,380
Alright.

2504
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,380
Hello everybody.

2505
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:05,100
Oh no.

2506
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:06,560
Oh no.

2507
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:06,800
I know.

2508
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:07,900
Oh my god.

2509
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:08,500
Poor Betty!

2510
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,320
He doesn't deserve that!

2511
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,460
There we go.

2512
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,920
There we go.

2513
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,380
The count of UFO mill and mobile scenery.

2514
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,320
Who put...

2515
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:20,460
Yeah.

2516
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,880
Who put that tree there?

2517
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,400
Spawn camping.

2518
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,740
Well I...

2519
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,540
I picked...

2520
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,320
I picked...

2521
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:30,800
The...

2522
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,900
I picked her first.

2523
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:32,500
So...

2524
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,160
I think the enemy team is bots.

2525
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,280
But my team isn't.

2526
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,960
I don't think my...

2527
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,980
Oh my melee is on the phoenix...

2528
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:39,380
The...

2529
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,080
The entity.

2530
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:44,420
That's not all player behavior.

2531
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,280
No, look at him.

2532
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,360
No, they're...

2533
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,060
Look at him.

2534
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,560
He's punching...

2535
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,220
He's punching women.

2536
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,320
So I think he's real.

2537
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:55,440
Alright.

2538
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,680
I think he's real.

2539
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,240
I think he's real.

2540
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:03,400
True.

2541
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,980
I'm pretty sure the Hulk is real.

2542
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,160
That Hulk is definitely a person.

2543
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:14,640
Four.

2544
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:15,560
Three.

2545
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:16,540
Two.

2546
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:17,580
One.

2547
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:19,380
Okay.

2548
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,610
Cause every time I've done like the early access the first game...

2549
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:25,730
This first game my team was real.

2550
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:29,050
But then like the enemy team is like 50-50.

2551
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:31,150
Sometimes they're real and sometimes they're not.

2552
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:33,150
So I can't tell.

2553
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:33,550
Okay.

2554
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:34,570
Our enemies are here.

2555
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:35,610
Okay.

2556
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:37,930
My name...

2557
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:38,210
Oh.

2558
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:38,730
Okay.

2559
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:39,830
I'll just stay here then.

2560
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:44,410
Okay.

2561
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:45,870
I was just like where?

2562
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:48,190
Oh.

2563
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:50,930
You know I fucked this guy in particular.

2564
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:53,410
Where am I?

2565
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:55,190
Where did I go?

2566
01:16:58,570 --> 01:16:58,910
Oh.

2567
01:16:58,910 --> 01:16:59,010
Alright.

2568
01:16:59,150 --> 01:16:59,270
Nice.

2569
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,810
We did it.

2570
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:00,490
Let's go up.

2571
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:01,230
Oh shit.

2572
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:03,210
Okay.

2573
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:03,530
Nice.

2574
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:08,070
Alright.

2575
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:09,590
I know you'll be dead.

2576
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:10,630
So I don't have to look at him.

2577
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,130
What the fuck was that?

2578
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:12,550
Uh...

2579
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:13,870
Well it's more so like...

2580
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:15,630
It's just cancelled summons.

2581
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,290
So...

2582
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:17,730
Um...

2583
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:19,610
Get over here.

2584
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:20,410
Hahaha.

2585
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,830
Get over you little stupid fly.

2586
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:24,690
That's right.

2587
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,230
Oh my god.

2588
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:30,410
If I was like an actual DPS player.

2589
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:31,370
Imagine...

2590
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:32,470
Like...

2591
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:34,410
Like I could kill everyone.

2592
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:35,070
Basically.

2593
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:37,830
Oh shit.

2594
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:38,330
Goodbye.

2595
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:41,510
Like I can actually...

2596
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,810
If I was an actual DPS player.

2597
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,530
I'd be killing so many people.

2598
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:47,690
Cause it's like...

2599
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:49,130
A point and click adventure.

2600
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:51,670
It's literally a point and click adventure.

2601
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:52,470
Hahaha.

2602
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:57,910
Hello.

2603
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,270
Like I just gotta hit my shot.

2604
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,520
Oh my god.

2605
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,740
This is so dumb.

2606
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:10,900
This character.

2607
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:12,100
Okay.

2608
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,680
I hate the healing.

2609
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:16,800
Okay.

2610
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:17,400
Where are they?

2611
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:19,740
Oh.

2612
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,080
Bob win.

2613
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,700
All right.

2614
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,060
Goodbye.

2615
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,580
Hulk.

2616
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:27,540
Oh.

2617
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,400
Don't worry.

2618
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:30,240
I'm coming over.

2619
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:32,020
Weeeee.

2620
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:34,520
Hello little.

2621
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:35,440
Hello bot.

2622
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,960
Hello little guy.

2623
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:39,580
Alright.

2624
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,560
A true SSD test here.

2625
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:43,920
After this game.

2626
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,260
I've seen enough.

2627
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,400
We gotta break... We gotta... Yo, fuck this one guy in particular.

2628
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,400
We gotta nerf Adam.

2629
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,740
I've seen enough.

2630
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,360
Someone stretch my back.

2631
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,900
Poor... There was no opportunity to use my hand.

2632
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,280
Just throwing it there.

2633
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:09,100
Alright.

2634
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:11,240
Now, next game it should be a real test.

2635
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,020
Big victory!

2636
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,420
Big win!

2637
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,180
That brain ball!

2638
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,920
I've seen enough.

2639
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,560
Take away Adam's res.

2640
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,080
Alright.

2641
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:29,320
Oh yeah.

2642
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,940
They added... They changed the...

2643
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:33,500
The... So you know when you're unlocking the Lord icon and stuff too.

2644
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:37,580
Alright.

2645
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:38,460
Alright.

2646
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,200
Now, the next game should be like a true...

2647
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,960
Like... A true real player versus real player.

2648
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,200
I think.

2649
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:45,740
I hope.

2650
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:46,440
Alright.

2651
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,880
I wonder if there's like Doom practice.

2652
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,100
There's actual people in Doom.

2653
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,340
There should be, right?

2654
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:52,440
Alright.

2655
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,010
Okay.

2656
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:01,510
Never mind.

2657
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:02,290
It's just me.

2658
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:04,890
It's just me.

2659
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:06,570
That skin is... I don't know.

2660
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:08,870
I... I like this skin more than...

2661
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:13,110
Her... Um... Her legendary cosmetic in general.

2662
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:14,350
It's just me.

2663
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,190
I'm the only one here.

2664
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,790
Hello, everybody.

2665
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:19,630
I'm so lonely.

2666
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:22,430
Anyone wanna come into Doom?

2667
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,070
Oh, it sucks.

2668
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:24,830
I wanna use the bathroom.

2669
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:26,610
But like, I wanna make sure I get... Jean.

2670
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:29,030
I... I wanna make sure I get it!

2671
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:33,050
It's the ultimate test...

2672
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:33,790
Of...

2673
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:36,070
It's the ultimate test of like...

2674
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:38,010
Who has a better PC and internet.

2675
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:39,750
For the next game.

2676
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:43,170
Lonely...

2677
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:44,150
I'm lonely...

2678
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:45,830
Mr. Lonely...

2679
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:48,750
I have nobody...

2680
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,210
To call my own...

2681
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:53,270
Oh, yeah.

2682
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,250
I should check the...

2683
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,510
Top 500 icon too.

2684
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:56,450
For next season.

2685
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:58,850
To be fair, I haven't like been grinding at all.

2686
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,730
To be fair.

2687
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:01,670
I hit Eternity and then I just stopped playing.

2688
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:04,450
Um...

2689
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:05,010
Like...

2690
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:05,430
Um...

2691
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,050
It's just... I don't know.

2692
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:06,970
I just don't have time.

2693
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:09,050
I don't have time to grind at all.

2694
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:09,850
Like the...

2695
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:11,010
Marble Rivals...

2696
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:14,190
You know like how I was supposed to stream at least like...

2697
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:15,370
I think like...

2698
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:15,710
Uh...

2699
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:19,070
At least 25 hours of Rivals every...

2700
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:19,410
Month?

2701
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:20,570
Um...

2702
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:21,750
But I haven't been doing that.

2703
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:22,990
Um...

2704
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:23,490
For...

2705
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:25,470
Cause I just don't have time.

2706
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:27,150
Haha, I just...

2707
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,770
I just didn't have time.

2708
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:29,230
They're like...

2709
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:29,770
Oh yeah, can you.

2710
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:33,190

2713
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:36,210
And I was like...

2714
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:36,770
I'm sorry.

2715
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:37,290
I...

2716
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:38,930
I don't have any.

2717
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:40,750
They're like...

2718
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:42,850
Oh my god...

2719
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:43,770
Oh we know...

2720
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:44,930
We noticed that you like didn't stream any.

2721
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:45,470
Can you like...

2722
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:46,070

2723
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:47,270
I'm just like...

2724
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:48,270
I'm just so busy.

2725
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,170
I'm sorry.

2726
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:52,450
I'm sorry.

2727
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:52,810
I'm sorry.

2728
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,130
I'm just so busy.

2729
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:59,370
What can we do to interest you more?

2730
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:06,170
To stream more rivals.

2731
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:08,770
And okay, she's like... I did not expect it.

2732
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:09,970
I was literally just fucking around.

2733
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,110
I'm just like, it's not you.

2734
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,090
It's me.

2735
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:18,210
I'm sorry.

2736
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:19,090
It's not you.

2737
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:20,690
It's me.

2738
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:22,450
I hear her.

2739
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:24,830
Oh my god, I hear her footsteps.

2740
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:26,570
I think she hears me and she doesn't know either.

2741
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:28,790
She's like, where the fuck is she?

2742
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:30,230
And I'm like, where the fuck are you?

2743
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:39,220
Hello.

2744
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,240
I hear- Oh, is she above me?

2745
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:43,780
I think she is.

2746
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,480
Yeah, I think she's above me.

2747
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,940
Like on the roof and shit.

2748
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,040
I'm pretty sure.

2749
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,640
I don't remember what does what do.

2750
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,360
Wait, where is she now?

2751
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:02,120
Oh, she's gonna show up now.

2752
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:06,460
Oh, that was good.

2753
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:07,780
Okay, she's definitely been playing.

2754
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,200
He's definitely been playing Phoenix.

2755
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,380
I'm just like, cause I don't have a grasp on the abilities yet.

2756
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:23,200
On like what to do on the abilities.

2757
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,820
Cause I'm still confused.

2758
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:27,760
Still dead.

2759
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:28,880
I think it's just aim.

2760
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,420
Yeah, cause like that.

2761
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:39,800
I don't have- I don't have the grasp on the abilities stuff.

2762
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,100
Especially with like, right click.

2763
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:47,960
Alright.

2764
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,480
I think she's just- I think she- I think she overtakes Hela.

2765
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:58,760
Honestly, she gives more- I think her- She has more like- She has like heals too, over time.

2766
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:01,080
If you land your fire strike stuff.

2767
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,560
She has her like, little heals.

2768
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:06,140
Honestly, I think she is a better Hela.

2769
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:06,680
Not the-

2770
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,940
Yeah, see I get like- There's like the heals too.

2771
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,100
Why not both?

2772
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:22,240
I think you need- I don't know if you need two.

2773
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,760
I think you have to have like a- Depending on the comp you're playing against people.

2774
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:27,780
Um.

2775
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,820
I feel like she's just- She could be just a better Hela.

2776
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:32,100
I don't know.

2777
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:36,100
Yeah.

2778
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,340
He's definitely- Uh.

2779
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:41,300
Hela- Yeah, Hela but with three escape abilities.

2780
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,960
This- Where is my game?

2781
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,040
It's a new map!

2782
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:46,760
Where's my game?

2783
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,380
Is everybody just in a custom lobby?

2784
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:56,700
I think everybody- Please, I just wanna play at least one game on this new map with real things.

2785
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:00,000
They got a game before I was here first!

2786
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,080
How did they get a game?

2787
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,480
Oh no shit, they're back.

2788
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:03,840
Okay.

2789
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:04,740
They're back.

2790
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:05,220
Okay.

2791
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:10,600
I was gonna be like- How did he get the- I- I'm so confused.

2792
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,420
Okay, he's back.

2793
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,520
He just was like- He's like, I'm gonna reset.

2794
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,500
I don't wanna fight this Doki person.

2795
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,460
I guess they don't know what they're doing.

2796
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,600
I'm like, true.

2797
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:22,280
True.

2798
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,340
I do not know what I'm doing.

2799
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:27,560
No, I am.

2800
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:28,100
I'm in queue.

2801
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:28,860
See on the top?

2802
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,400
It says, in queue.

2803
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:34,800
I've been in- Okay, if like- We don't get a game in the newest- Uh-

2804
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:42,610
Oh my god.

01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:44,010
Oh my god.

2806
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:46,410
Oh my god.

2807
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:47,450
The- the- Oh my god.

2808
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:50,510
I'm gonna say Phoenix 1v1 is like- Not fun.

2809
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:53,570
Cause there's so much.

2810
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:55,370
To keep track of.

2811
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,830
Phoenix 1v1 is not fun.

2812
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:00,950
Too much thinking.

2813
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:03,830
There's way too much thinking involved.

2814
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,890
Yeah, like- This guy definitely knows the movement for Phoenix already.

2815
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,320
I'm just like- Bro, I'm tired.

2816
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,800
I can't think right now.

2817
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:18,640
Like, what the fuck?

2818
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,000
Like, what the fuck?

2819
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:27,650
No, I think it's- I'm also really tired from- I didn't get a lot of sleep today.

2820
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:29,350
Uh, because of the concert prep.

2821
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:31,390
So I didn't get a lot of sleep.

2822
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:39,570
Yeah, she has like- Too many- Like- The 1v1 of- It's fun to like- Beat people up.

2823
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:43,850
But like- Like- Oh, she's not good against corridors.

2824
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:45,030
I think.

2825
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,430
Maybe?

2826
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:49,590
Corridor's not good for- If you're doing a Phoenix 1v1.

2827
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:52,530
Oh my god.

2828
01:26:52,710 --> 01:27:00,730
Okay, if we don't get a game in- Aw, he's just gonna grab- There we go.

2829
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:03,430
Okay, I thought he was gonna grab the health pack.

2830
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:04,770
But he didn't.

2831
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:08,250
I think it's whoever gets the right click off first.

2832
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:12,010
Because she got the right click off of me twice.

2833
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:13,970
I think that's it.

2834
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:17,650
It's whoever gets the right click off of the other Phoenix wins the 1v1.

2835
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:22,880
Yeah, see?

2836
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,060
I got the right click off.

2837
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,880
That's basically it.

2838
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,940
I like- I sort of figured it out.

2839
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:29,900
For 1v1s.

2840
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:34,160
Cause like the right click does so much damage on squishies.

2841
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,260
Cause like- Especially they're walking into it.

2842
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,500
And like- She's won a lot of them because she-

2843
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:45,690
Oh my- No!

2844
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:46,570
Fuck!

2845
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:48,150
I whiffed that.

2846
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,030
Alright, fuck this.

2847
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:51,230
I'm queuing regular match.

2848
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:53,770
Fuck this.

2849
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:58,510
I'm gonna- Queue up- Uh- The regular quick play.

2850
01:27:58,610 --> 01:28:00,430
Maybe I'll get one from regular quick play.

2851
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:02,790
I think I'm gonna get one from regular map.

2852
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:05,790
The whiff- Yeah, I whiffed that.

2853
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:10,190
No, that's just doom match.

2854
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:12,190
It's not- It's not uh-

2855
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:18,390
It's not like- That's just doom- Doom match.

2856
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:23,790
So like- So like- If you hit the right click, you get heals over time.

2857
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,010
Okay, wait.

2858
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:26,750
I think?

2859
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:27,330
Was it?

2860
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:31,790
No, it's the stack.

2861
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:32,630
Okay, it's the stack.

2862
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,350
As soon as you stack it, you get the heal.

2863
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:36,090
Oh, okay.

2864
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:37,850
So I just need to hit continuously.

2865
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:38,770
That's it.

2866
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:39,650
Yeah, we gotta nerf Adam.

2867
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:43,450
Okay, so if I get the stack, I hit it.

2868
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:47,510
This is also like- But the right click already gives you one stack.

2869
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:48,450
So...

2870
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:50,890
Yeah, I get that.

2871
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:58,050
So as long as I hit like, one right click, I get the- Uh, I get the stack in general.

2872
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:00,370
I understand!

2873
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:02,850
Where are my players?

2874
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:05,010
Please!

2875
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:09,010
I just wanna- Let me do one game.

2876
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:11,090
At least give me one game on Gene.

2877
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:12,730
That's all I want.

2878
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:15,850
I want one game.

2879
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:16,830
Haha.

2880
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:18,510
Haha.

2881
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:19,570
Haha.

2882
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:22,390
Jesus, that's crazy.

2883
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:22,930
Haha.

2884
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:24,290
I just want one game!

2885
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,710
I just want one game!

2886
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:31,370
Also, sound guy, has the- Is the sound okay for the rivals?

2887
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:37,290
I'm- So I can like make that as the- As my usual default setting for rivals.

2888
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:40,570
Everyone went to sleep- Please!

2889
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:43,770
I just- Let me play one match!

2890
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:44,990
I just wanna know!

2891
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:48,350
I don't know how they just started.

2892
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:49,750
There's no way.

2893
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:51,290
I started the early access too late?

2894
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:52,430
Or some shit?

2895
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:53,270
No way.

2896
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:58,030
I think... Oh, I think people are just doing custom lobbies, maybe.

2897
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:00,690
Yeah.

2898
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:06,770
But, like, custom lobbies are so awkward because, like, people want you all to join the VC.

2899
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:12,050
Okay, I don't like doing the custom lobbies because they all want you to join the VC.

2900
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:16,930
And then, like, but, like, and so, like, you can coordinate who gets to play Gene.

2901
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:19,510
So, like, I don't want to deal with that.

2902
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:24,070
I don't want to... I don't want to join VC.

2903
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:27,650
And they, like, expect you to calm and stuff because they're like, oh, we're...

2904
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:32,050
Because it's like, oh, we're all content creators, so let's all try and make content together and...

2905
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:36,330
And, like, talk to each other.

2906
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:38,210
And I'm like, no, I'm anti-social.

2907
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:39,510
I'm tired.

2908
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:43,870
I didn't... I don't want to talk to people right now.

2909
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:46,330
You might be... I'm pretty sure they're nice people.

2910
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:48,950
I just don't want to talk to anyone right now.

2911
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:55,190
I... I don't... I... This is my content.

2912
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:57,710
I... I'm not gonna make a YouTube video out of this.

2913
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:00,730
I just want to try out her character kit.

2914
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:03,070
And then go back to support at rank.

2915
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:03,990
Like...

2916
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:07,570
This is... This is the only time I get to play DPS.

2917
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:11,210
And it's when they release DPS characters.

2918
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:12,790
Wait.

2919
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:13,390
That's all it took?

2920
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:14,170
Really?

2921
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:19,630
I just wanna... I just... And then I have to go back to support... Oh my god.

2922
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:23,990
I have to go back to support duty anyway when I play on my main.

2923
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:27,110
Yeah.

2924
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:30,350
Did you just get done with a fucking 3D concert?

2925
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:31,870
That's right.

2926
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:34,370
With three hours of sleep?

2927
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:35,550
That's okay, right.

2928
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:39,850
Alright.

2929
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:44,730
I need, like, use the shift more... better.

2930
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:49,610
I use the shift to go to places, but I feel like the shift is better to use...

2931
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:51,610
As safe as an escape ability.

2932
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:53,010
I don't know.

2933
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:54,850
I don't know.

2934
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:55,290
Okay.

2935
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:56,790
I'm sad.

2936
01:31:57,170 --> 01:31:58,610
Where the fuck is my...

2937
01:31:58,610 --> 01:31:59,610
Quick play match?

2938
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:00,250
Alright.

2939
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:03,810
We're gonna wait until... If I don't get a game within...

2940
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:05,150
Uh...

2941
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,670
If I don't get a game within, like...

2942
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:09,950
I don't know.

2943
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:10,610
Eight minutes?

2944
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:13,430
When it hits eight minutes, I still don't get a game?

2945
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,030
I'll check the custom lobbies.

2946
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:17,490
I'll...

2947
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:20,170
I'll roam into the custom lobbies.

2948
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:28,950
I think this is the first season where, like, the games are harder to find in general.

2949
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:31,690
Because I feel like I didn't start off that...

2950
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:34,230
The thing is, I feel like I didn't start off...

2951
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:38,310
I didn't start off that late, too, for early access.

2952
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:39,890
I literally did my stream...

2953
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:42,930
Because, like, early access was out for the regular players.

2954
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:44,370
The ones that don't get paid.

2955
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:48,110
I can feel your pain.

2956
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:49,190
Um...

2957
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:50,010
At four.

2958
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:52,510
And I started my stream at, like...

2959
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:53,350
I don't know, what was it?

2960
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:54,150
5.15?

2961
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:57,730
And then, like, I started queuing up at, like, six.

2962
01:32:58,530 --> 01:32:58,890
So...

2963
01:32:58,890 --> 01:33:00,210
What, was it six or 6.30?

2964
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:02,470
It was, like, you know, two and a half...

2965
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:03,730
It was, like, two and a half hours.

2966
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:04,830
I guess, like, a lot of...

2967
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:05,550
Um...

2968
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:06,510
I don't know.

2969
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:08,970
Maybe everybody was done after two and a half hours.

2970
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:14,690
Yeah, but it's more so, like, the content creator side, though.

2971
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:17,870
That sucks.

2972
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:20,850
I think a lot of them just decided to do custom lobbies.

2973
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:22,230
Maybe.

2974
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:26,430
And in, like, two and a half hours, you're like, alright, we recorded everything we need for content.

2975
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,450
Yeah, all the content was made during my yapping.

2976
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:33,550
Goddammit.

2977
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:34,770
And compiling shaders.

2978
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:36,790
At least I'm, like...

2979
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:39,610
I'm doing, like, uh, aim trainer right now.

2980
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:44,930
I'm just aim training at the moment.

2981
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:46,310
Yeah.

2982
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:48,490
There is a serv...

2983
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:49,910
No, that's where the custom lobbies are.

2984
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:50,670
But I really don't want...

2985
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:50,850
I don't...

2986
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:52,710
I personally just don't want to join custom lobbies.

2987
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:55,490
Because you're expected to, like, communicate with people.

2988
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:57,510
Join the custom lobbies.

2989
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:59,210
And actually, like, work together.

2990
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:03,750
I'm too tired for that right now.

2991
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:05,630
I have another stream later today.

2992
01:34:05,790 --> 01:34:07,510
I cannot be bothered.

2993
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:08,410
I...

2994
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:09,890
I really...

2995
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:11,590
I cannot be fucking bothered.

2996
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:13,930
I just want to play...

2997
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:18,330
I swear, if I do get a game within the eight minute mark.

2998
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:20,970
Um, and then I don't get to play Gene.

2999
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:22,570
It's just never meant to me.

3000
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:23,330
It...

3001
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:28,170
I'm just covaxing right now.

3002
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:30,710
It's literally never meant to be.

3003
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:32,550
Her right click is so crazy, though.

3004
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:33,670
I feel like...

3005
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:34,390
If there's...

3006
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:36,330
They're at the choke, and you can just...

3007
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:38,330
Because I think you can use your right click twice.

3008
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:39,990
Like...

3009
01:34:40,430 --> 01:34:41,650
They're just walking forward.

3010
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:43,130
Like, that shit is crazy.

3011
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:43,990
The spam.

3012
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:45,890
Because it's like, what?

3013
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,010
An eight second cooldown?

3014
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:49,170
I think he can, like...

3015
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:51,170
He can spam that, like, twice.

3016
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:52,050
I'm pretty sure.

3017
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:54,710
Like, if they're in the choke.

3018
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,350
Like, this shit is insane.

3019
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,870
Alright.

3020
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:03,190
I'm covaxing.

3021
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:05,470
Because I have not played...

3022
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:06,230
I have not...

3023
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,730
Played in...

3024
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:09,270
Okay, and then be like, Oh, but what about Halo?

3025
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:09,670
Okay.

3026
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:11,030
Halo is so different.

3027
01:35:14,430 --> 01:35:16,290
Like, I haven't played an actual...

3028
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:19,030
Aim game in, like, a while.

3029
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:20,310
I think, like, in, like...

3030
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:22,290
A week and a half now?

3031
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:23,170
I'm pretty sure.

3032
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:25,070
So, like...

3033
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:27,170
I could feel my aim being, like, a little...

3034
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:28,810
Like...

3035
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:29,490
Rusty.

3036
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:32,610
So, this is, like, the most aim I've got in a while.

3037
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:36,670
Guys, I'm not aiming in Elden Ring.

3038
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:40,170
I have no depth perception for that.

3039
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:43,970
Yeah, I'm super rusty right now.

3040
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:45,430
I can tell.

3041
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:47,770
So, I'm, like...

3042
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:49,270
I'm, like, trying to...

3043
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:51,830
Unrusty-rust myself at the moment.

3044
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:52,970
Oh, my god.

3045
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:53,590
It's eight minutes.

3046
01:35:53,770 --> 01:35:53,930
Alright.

3047
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:57,210
It's time to venture into the lands of custom lobbies.

3048
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:58,150
It's time.

3049
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:00,850
It's time to brave the worlds.

3050
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:04,070
And then, like, we're not even gonna find a game.

3051
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:06,350
Kill it.

3052
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:08,150
Alright.

3053
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:08,270
Alright.

3054
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:11,230
It's time to brave the lands.

3055
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:12,110
Okay.

3056
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:13,230
But what about nine minutes?

3057
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:13,950
Alright.

3058
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:14,570
What about nine...

3059
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:14,750
Okay.

3060
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:15,630
I'll do one...

3061
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:16,470
I'll do ten minutes.

3062
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:20,230
If we can't find a game within ten minutes, we'll brave...

3063
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:22,070
Oh, I'm by myself again.

3064
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:22,990
I'm...

3065
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:23,370
I'm...

3066
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:24,950
I'm...

3067
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:26,350
I'm...

3068
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:27,790
I'm gonna switch the lights.

3069
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:30,230
Gotta be a person.

3070
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:32,690
I have to be a...

3071
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:33,170
Goddamn...

3072
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:34,250
person!

3073
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:36,450
No!

3074
01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:39,470
Oh, the up?

3075
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:40,070
Okay.

3076
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:40,870
Cherry.

3077
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:42,050
I'll show you guys the up.

3078
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:44,130
I'll passively...

3079
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:44,530
Oh, hey.

3080
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,570
There's caboose.

3081
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:51,730
There's...

3082
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:52,270
Goodbye.

3083
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:53,290
Nevermind.

3084
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:54,730
There's no caboose.

3085
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:55,330
Okay.

3086
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:55,890
One more minute.

3087
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:56,290
Come on.

3088
01:36:56,370 --> 01:36:57,790
Give me a game in one minute.

3089
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:58,470
Come on.

3090
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:01,410
Give me a game in one minute.

3091
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:02,390
Come on.

3092
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,630
Come on.

3093
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:04,170
It's all I want.

3094
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:07,890
Come on, buddy.

3095
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:10,230
You know you want to.

3096
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,430
Just one game.

3097
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:16,930
Where I don't have to actually interact with people.

3098
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:18,490
And I can just go...

3099
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:19,270
Pew, pew, pew.

3100
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:27,370
I just wanna shoot a person in game.

3101
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,470
In game, guys.

3102
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,710
No!

3103
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:34,670
Alright, guys.

3104
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:35,690
It seems I might...

3105
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:35,830
Okay.

3106
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:37,230
We can't get into a custom lobby.

3107
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:37,810
It's just...

3108
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:38,470
We just got it.

3109
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:38,930
Like...

3110
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:39,870
We did all we could.

3111
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:41,330
We saw...

3112
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:43,050
What G was like against bots.

3113
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:44,070
I think that's good enough.

3114
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:45,510
That's like...

3115
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:46,190
Basically...

3116
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:48,050
The regular ELO anyway.

3117
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:51,850
That's just the average ELO.

3118
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:53,530
It's almost the same thing.

3119
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:54,550
It's all...

3120
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,530
I am in quick play.

3121
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:59,090
I've been in two...

3122
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:01,190
I've queued quick play for the new map.

3123
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:03,130
And also the...

3124
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:06,930
Also the quick play for the non new maps.

3125
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:08,290
Alright.

3126
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:09,110
It's time.

3127
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:10,970
Alright.

3128
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:13,230
It's time.

3129
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:14,650
My...

3130
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:15,610
Cancel.

3131
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:16,500
Match.

3132
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:20,930
Cancel.

3133
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:23,030
Match.

3134
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:24,950
Alright.

3135
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:26,010
Custom game.

3136
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:28,950
Wait, isn't this...

3137
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:31,970
Oh.

3138
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:32,350
Okay.

3139
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:32,950
He left.

3140
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:35,570
I was gonna say.

3141
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:38,970
Who's this?

3142
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,710
I don't know who all of these people are.

3143
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:42,330
Okay.

3144
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:42,610
Here.

3145
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:43,130
Oh my god.

3146
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:44,090
They are all here.

3147
01:38:44,810 --> 01:38:45,810
Is that...

3148
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:46,110
Okay.

3149
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:50,050
We are a six stack.

3150
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:51,110
Are you...

3151
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:51,570
Okay.

3152
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:53,910
Who's doing...

3153
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:54,250
Who's doing...

3154
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,050
They are all actually in the custom...

3155
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:56,590
Oh my god.

3156
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:58,810
Everybody was just stacking custom lobbies.

3157
01:38:59,410 --> 01:38:59,630
I...

3158
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:00,870
I'm fucking kidding me.

3159
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,450
Everyone is actually just...

3160
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:03,470
Oh my god.

3161
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:04,050
Hey.

3162
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:10,410
Everyone was actually...

3163
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:12,470
Literally just playing custom lobbies.

3164
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:13,210
Holy fuck.

3165
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:15,230
Like...

3166
01:39:15,230 --> 01:39:17,490
Everybody has friends.

3167
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:18,730
Not fair.

3168
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:20,210
Wait.

3169
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:21,150
This is EU.

3170
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:21,990
These are all...

3171
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:23,370
This is an EU six stack.

3172
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:24,330
Oh my god.

3173
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:25,070
They're not gonna start.

3174
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:25,990
Oh my god.

3175
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:29,090
Oh my god.

3176
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:30,170
Is there like...

3177
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:30,570
Okay.

3178
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:33,370
Uh...

3179
01:39:33,370 --> 01:39:34,650
Which one did I join?

3180
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:35,950
I don't even remember.

3181
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:36,870
Okay.

3182
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:37,550
Is it this?

3183
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:39,510
Are they...

3184
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,730
Who's the leader here?

3185
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:42,830
Guys.

3186
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:43,450
Please.

3187
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:44,290
I just...

3188
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:45,290
Wanna play.

3189
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:46,390
I...

3190
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:48,290
Stay.

3191
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:48,910
Okay.

3192
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,270
Do not leave.

3193
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:56,650
Oh.

3194
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:57,650
But we're gonna like fight.

3195
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:58,330
Okay.

3196
01:39:58,590 --> 01:39:59,370
Also like...

3197
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:01,030
We're all just gonna fight for Jean.

3198
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:02,050
Oh my god.

3199
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:03,050
I know I'm not gonna get...

3200
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:04,110
That's also the thing.

3201
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:05,490
I know I'm not gonna get...

3202
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:06,330
Um...

3203
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:06,590
Jean.

3204
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:08,450
Because I can feel...

3205
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:08,970
They're...

3206
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:09,450
I...

3207
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:09,670
I...

3208
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:10,090
I...

3209
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:10,130
I...

3210
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:10,170
I...

3211
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:10,250
I...

3212
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,030
They're all just gonna...

3213
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:11,710
Take it.

3214
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:12,430
I...

3215
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:14,230
Take your hero.

3216
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:15,310
Or villain.

3217
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:16,310
I'm so faster.

3218
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:17,270
I'm so faster.

3219
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:17,850
Let's go.

3220
01:40:19,330 --> 01:40:19,850
Um...

3221
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:20,510
Wait, wait, wait.

3222
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:20,790
Hello.

3223
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:22,570
I'm so...

3224
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:23,550
I'm so...

3225
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:23,990
Is...

3226
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:24,810
Does Doki have a mic?

3227
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:26,570
Goddammit!

3228
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:30,230
Bro, I just wanna play one game.

3229
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:30,550
I...

3230
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:31,090
Then I'm out.

3231
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:32,310
I'm like...

3232
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:32,850
So done.

3233
01:40:34,330 --> 01:40:34,850
I'm...

3234
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:36,110
I still have...

3235
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:39,490
Bro, I still have...

3236
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:40,250
Bro, I'm just...

3237
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:40,970
I'm just doing one game.

3238
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,230
Wait, can Doki at least hear me?

3239
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:43,350
I wanna...

3240
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:44,350
I wanna do the...

3241
01:40:44,350 --> 01:40:46,870
Did everyone miss me while I was off soaring through the stars?

3242
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:52,090
Yo, Mina.

3243
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:53,170
Can you hear me?

3244
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:55,770
I'm...

3245
01:40:55,770 --> 01:40:56,750
She doesn't.

3246
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:58,810
30 seconds before you attack.

3247
01:40:59,050 --> 01:40:59,730
Get ready.

3248
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:02,910
Alright, here we go.

3249
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:04,190
I'm...

3250
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:05,150
I'm out after this.

3251
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:05,950
I just want...

3252
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:10,710
I'm just...

3253
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:11,610
I'm out after this.

3254
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:11,930
I'm...

3255
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:12,450
I'm done.

3256
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:12,870
I...

3257
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:14,810
You like my new skin.

3258
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:16,290
This is it.

3259
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:18,070
This is sucking it.

3260
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:19,590
This is sucking it.

3261
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:22,290
Alright.

3262
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:22,790
Yeah.

3263
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:23,890
I told...

3264
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:24,410
I told you.

3265
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:24,790
I'm...

3266
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:25,610
I can't...

3267
01:41:25,610 --> 01:41:27,610
I don't like custom lobbies because of it.

3268
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:28,290
Because they like...

3269
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:29,830
People try too hard.

3270
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:30,070
I'm just cringled right there.

3271
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:34,990
And they all want you to talk.

3272
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:36,790
And I was like, I don't wanna attack!

3273
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:38,890
I just want a pit.

3274
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:39,890
Uh oh.

3275
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:44,150
Oh, I just went into the chair.

3276
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:49,910
Nice.

3277
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:51,570
Alright.

3278
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:56,510
Okay, wait, who's that?

3279
01:41:57,530 --> 01:42:00,490
It looks like the mission area is yours to capture now.

3280
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:03,530
Oh, unlucky.

3281
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:04,590
Wait, where's our support?

3282
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:05,050
Okay.

3283
01:42:05,570 --> 01:42:09,070
I was gonna say... Oh, our mantis... Oh, our invis woman died.

3284
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:14,550
I don't want to socialize.

3285
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:15,810
I just want to play.

3286
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:20,210
I don't even socialize in rank.

3287
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:25,050
How do you expect me to socialize in a fucking play?

3288
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:36,750
Okay.

3289
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:39,170
Also, these players are actually good.

3290
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:41,870
I recognize, like, one of them.

3291
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:45,630
Okay.

3292
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:46,570
Oh my god.

3293
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:47,650
I actually have to think, too.

3294
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:48,210
This sucks.

3295
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:58,160
Oh.

3296
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,180
Oh, you can dodge.

3297
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:00,720
Okay, this guy actually plays Star-Lord.

3298
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,140
What is this?

3299
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:06,590
Are you serious?

3300
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:07,550
She dodged it?

3301
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,180
Oh my god.

3302
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,540
This guy actually plays Star-Lord.

3303
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:15,100
This sucks.

3304
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,840
Guys, I'm just a support player.

3305
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:21,360
I'm literally just a... Fuck this.

3306
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,700
Hello, I'm safe.

3307
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:27,040
I'm safe now.

3308
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:27,360
Hello.

3309
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,260
Oh my god.

3310
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:28,620
Please.

3311
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,940
You can't catch me.

3312
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:30,600
You see that?

3313
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:31,860
Turning up the heat.

3314
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:33,960
Oh.

3315
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,040
These guys actually play DPS.

3316
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,420
This fucking sucks.

3317
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:40,140
Okay, I got trapped.

3318
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,020
Wait, it's a 5v... Oh my god.

3319
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:48,720
It was... It was a 5v6 anyway.

3320
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:57,620
Guys, I told you.

3321
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:00,940
This is why I didn't want to touch Custom Lobby.

3322
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:03,120
This is exactly...

3323
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:09,020
This is exactly why.

3324
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:11,820
Hello.

3325
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:14,420
I'm gonna die to this.

3326
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,120
I'm pretty sure.

3327
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:19,200
Oh, we're fucking dead.

3328
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,700
I don't think we have.

3329
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:26,880
Oh my god.

3330
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,280
Oh my...

3331
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:33,930
Hello.

3332
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:35,170
I'll play around this.

3333
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:39,630
Alright.

3334
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:40,410
Alright.

3335
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:41,250
I lived.

3336
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:43,550
I lived somehow.

3337
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:48,650
See?

3338
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:49,870
Holy shit.

3339
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:51,910
I'm just aim training at this point.

3340
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:55,290
I lived.

3341
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:57,730
If we stay focused, we've got this.

3342
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:03,150
I hate this map.

3343
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:05,630
Bro, someone left like...

3344
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:08,210
While we were play- like in the middle of this.

3345
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:09,630
Before you attack.

3346
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:10,490
Get ready.

3347
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:11,490
I lived.

3348
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:16,530
There's the- who's the host?

3349
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,580
That was a long time ago.

3350
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:24,000
Now, I'm just Mantis.

3351
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:25,220
Oh!

3352
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:27,000
Did he wanted Gina and then left?

3353
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:31,320
This guy is- Alright.

3354
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:32,720
That's good enough.

3355
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:40,200
That's- That's- That's- Oh my god.

3356
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,240
I'm stuck too.

3357
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:42,040
That's good enough.

3358
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:42,920
That's- That's enough.

3359
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:43,700
That's good enough.

3360
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:44,540
We got our game.

3361
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:47,040
We- We got our game.

3362
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:48,960
I'm- I'm good.

3363
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:49,660
I-

3364
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:55,530
We got- We got our game.

3365
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:01,950
Guys, this is exactly why I don't do custom lobbies.

3366
01:46:02,110 --> 01:46:04,370
It's just- It's too scuffed.

3367
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:07,670
I- I'm just like normal randoms.

3368
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:10,170
I- I got my game.

3369
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:18,350
I- It's always so fun to socialize, guys.

3370
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:24,730
See, if you go in quick match, I don't have to have the oblig- Like, it's just like, you know, I feel less guilty.

3371
01:46:25,730 --> 01:46:26,530
Not talking.

3372
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:29,290
But people just wanna talk in custom lobbies.

3373
01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:33,950
And I'm like, bro, I just wanna- And then- And then like, when you don't- And then when people don't get Jean.

3374
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:37,110
Um, when people don't get Jean, they leave.

3375
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,690
And there's no way to backfill too.

3376
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:39,770
So that's the worst part.

3377
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:41,330
There's no like, backfilling.

3378
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:46,570
Uh- Guy r- Ragequid cuz Doki has the better system.

3379
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:47,570
Like, oh, I'm sorry.

3380
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:49,570
We're all content creators here.

3381
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:53,450
Like, I- I just- Happen to have the better fucking system.

3382
01:46:53,810 --> 01:46:54,690
I'm sorry.

3383
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:59,870
I just- Maybe like, QA quick match.

3384
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:01,710
She'll like, put me in while I rant.

3385
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:02,410
Who knows?

3386
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:03,610
We'll- we'll test it out.

3387
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:05,090
Scout, thank you for the super chat.

3388
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:06,030
Thank you- thank you.

3389
01:47:06,290 --> 01:47:06,790
Fun fact.

3390
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:08,890
The image of Wolverine looking at Polaroid.

3391
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:10,570
That Jean comes from the Phoenix arc.

3392
01:47:10,730 --> 01:47:12,450
When he thinks she's dead from Sinestro.

3393
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:15,190
At least that's what the 90's X-Men cartoon taught me.

3394
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:16,050
Thank you, the super chat.

3395
01:47:16,210 --> 01:47:17,050
Thank you, thank you.

3396
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:19,450
Um, but yeah.

3397
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:20,350
But, you know what?

3398
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:22,790
I got a chance to like, try out Jean.

3399
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:25,610
I think like, I think it was just 5v6.

3400
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:26,470
Like, we weren't winning that.

3401
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:29,730
It was just unlucky on my end.

3402
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:34,630
Um, it was like, just five- Yeah, like, I just stole Phoenix.

3403
01:47:34,850 --> 01:47:36,350
So then we didn't get an actual round.

3404
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:38,990
And then, the Starlight player was an actual DPS player.

3405
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:40,910
I could tell from- he was an actual Star-Lord.

3406
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:42,910
Like, one- like, I could- I don't want to say one trick.

3407
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:46,150
But I can tell that he was an actual Star-Lord player.

3408
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:48,770
Just because of his like, of the- yeah.

3409
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:50,470
He knew how to dodge.

3410
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:53,050
He had like, the dodges correctly.

3411
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:55,850
Where he can basically dodge like, you know, with any ability.

3412
01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:58,550
And all- with just this like, dodge movement.

3413
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:00,470
Um, so, he knew how to play.

3414
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:02,210
And I was like, like, that's- I just- I knew.

3415
01:48:02,290 --> 01:48:03,130
I was like, fuck it, whatever.

3416
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:09,690
But, anyway.

3417
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:11,450
I'm gonna call that- I'm gonna call that here.

3418
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:13,150
Because we have another stream later today, anyway.

3419
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:16,930
Um, I don't think we're gonna grab- get another game in.

3420
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:19,850
And like, I really don't want to deal with custom lobbies.

3421
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:24,050
Because like, people are just- Everyone wants to play Jean!

3422
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:25,690
And there's no backfill!

3423
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:27,990
So like, there's no- it's just not fun.

3424
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:32,810
Um, anyway guys.

3425
01:48:32,830 --> 01:48:41,670
I think in the future, when I do these early access, I'm definitely gonna- Um, I'm definitely gonna try and like, just queue up the games right off the bat.

3426
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:49,270
Just cause like, I feel like- I feel like, you know, all the players got- already got all the content they needed.

3427
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:52,690
And like, there's not enough players in the quick match rotation right now.

3428
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:57,790
Um, and everybody's just doing custom lobbies with their friends or other content creators.

3429
01:48:57,790 --> 01:49:03,550
Which makes sense, but like, um- But like, I just- I'm just tired.

3430
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:09,730
Anyways, I hope you guys have fun checking out the new season.

3431
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:14,790
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3432
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:17,050
If you stay up for me, stay up a little longer.

3433
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:20,030
Cause I have a- Uh, special announcement.

3434
01:49:20,490 --> 01:49:22,190
Um, later today.

3435
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:24,090
Uh, for the birthday countdown.

3436
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:26,550
So yes, uh, stay up a little longer for that.

3437
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:27,570
I'm gonna take a fucking nap.

3438
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:28,430
I'm so tired.

3439
01:49:28,870 --> 01:49:32,370
Uh, I know I keep saying that, but- I am very exhausted.

3440
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:33,270
Uh, cool.

3441
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:34,290
Thank you for the super chat.

3442
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,610
Thank you.

3443
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:35,230
Thank you.

3444
01:49:35,530 --> 01:49:37,030
Why does squirrel girl look like that?

3445
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:37,770
Uh-huh.

3446
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:42,430
Oh yeah, you guys want- Oh, this is- This is her- Her- Oh my god!

3447
01:49:43,630 --> 01:49:44,070
Bro!

3448
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:46,590
It takes up the entire screen!

3449
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:49,290
Like, you don't even see her anymore.

3450
01:49:49,610 --> 01:49:51,030
This is her charm point.

3451
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:51,530
Right?

3452
01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:58,770
Hey guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3453
01:49:58,770 --> 01:50:00,170
Stay up for me.

3454
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:02,250
Stay up a little longer for tonight's stream.

3455
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,770
Anyway guys, I'll see you guys later everybody.

3456
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:04,410
Bye guys!

3457
01:50:04,670 --> 01:50:04,870
Bye!
