guys whoops sorry professional VTuber here guys sorry double tap the screen guys remember to double tap the screen guys

2
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,050
Okay.

3
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,010
Sorry.

4
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,570
I had a whole fucking side quest today.

5
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,750
So that's why I was late.

6
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:34,950
I had to accept a side quest where I actually had to go outside and like walk to the post office.

7
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,750
My fucking Google Maps lied to me.

8
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,030
It was like, it's going to be like 10 minutes.

9
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,070
It was like, oh, maybe I'm just a very slow walker.

10
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,030
Uh, but it was not 10 minutes.

11
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,310
It did not feel like 10 minutes.

12
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:56,930
Um, the reason why I went to the post office, they're like, you must be like wondering, why didn't you go to the post office earlier, Doki?

13
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:05,130
You pin, you like had that pin message, um, on like, like two, like two hours before the stream was supposed to start.

14
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,010
Um, it's, uh, it's because, um, I have a very good reason.

15
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,250
I have a very good reason.

16
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,610
Master Job, thank you for the 50 gifted ships.

17
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,150
Thank you.

18
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,790
Thank you.

19
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,330
Oh my God.

20
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,470
That's so many gifted.

21
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,890
Thank you so much, everybody.

22
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,950
Okay.

23
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,990
I have like a very perfectly good reason that has nothing to do with laziness.

24
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,110
And like, it is very reasonable why, like I went to the post office that late.

25
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,870
So the reason why was because I woke up at 3 p.m.

26
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,490
and, um, I ordered food.

27
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,230
I, okay.

28
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,750
I had to like do my error.

29
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,690
I had to do like the morning routine stuff.

30
00:03:45,910 --> 00:04:01,870
So then I ordered food at, uh, at like, uh, 3.30 and, um, I ordered food at 3.30 and then it just got delayed until, and it wasn't going to arrive until like 4.30.

31
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,830
So I was like, fuck.

32
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,470
I thought it would arrive sooner.

33
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,230
So I was like, okay.

34
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,530
Okay.

35
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:18,710
So I went to the post office, like, uh, now after I ordered food, like maybe like it'll arrive earlier.

36
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,330
So like, I couldn't take the risk.

37
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,670
I couldn't take the risk.

38
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:32,290
So I have to wait until the food arrived, uh, munch it down for like, eat the food for 10 minutes and then, uh, and then walk to the post office.

39
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,250
Um, a very brisk walk too, by the way.

40
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,330
Anyway, so that is why, that is why, um, that is why I was late.

41
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,250
That is why I was late.

42
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,930
Also, I also had a side quest.

43
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:50,530
uh, were, I went to Timmy's, I went to Tim Hortons to grab a drink because I wanted something cold to drink.

44
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,590
And then I saw that they had like Nutella.

45
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,630
I was like, ooh, Nutella, Nutella ice cap.

46
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,990
That sounds neat.

47
00:04:59,190 --> 00:04:59,710
It's new.

48
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,790
I was like, Hmm, how come I haven't had Nutella in a very long time?

49
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,510
It's been years since I've had any Nutella, but people always talk about how great Nutella is.

50
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,910
I wonder why I haven't had Nutella in a long time.

51
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,210
And then I drank it, and I was just like, oh, that's... I remember, it's because I hate Nutella.

52
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,510
I took a sip, I was like, oh yeah, I fucking hate Nutella.

53
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,830
I don't... I didn't remember.

54
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,050
I didn't remember why I didn't like... I didn't remember that I hated Nutella.

55
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,930
I was just like, I wonder why I haven't drank Nutella in a long time.

56
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,090
I wonder why I haven't ate any Nutella-related stuff in a long time.

57
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,610
And I was like, oh yeah, it's because I don't like Nutella.

58
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:59,490
I never grew up with Nutella.

59
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,990
Because when Nutella became super popular, I guess in NA, I wasn't living in NA.

60
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,910
So it wasn't popular... Nutella wasn't that popular in Asia.

61
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,830
So the very first time...

62
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,230
I've had Nutella was when I was in high school.

63
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,350
So I just never grew up with a taste for Nutella.

64
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,210
It was just not for me.

65
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,410
I just remembered it.

66
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,430
I think I suppressed that memory for a long time.

67
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,630
And I just remembered it.

68
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,370
Taking that sip from the Nutella ice cap reminded me of how much I just never liked Nutella.

69
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,990
No, I'm not allergic.

70
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,750
The only thing I'm allergic to is strawberries.

71
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,570
So I'm not...

72
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,670
If I was allergic to nut, I would not be here right now.

73
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,930
I would be in the fucking hospital.

74
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:52,170
I would actually not show up if I was allergic to nuts.

75
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,830
Anyway, the reason why I don't like Nutella is just the nuttiness.

76
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,330
It's just really...

77
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,590
I thought it would be more chocolatey.

78
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,230
The nut flavor is just so overpowering.

79
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,710
And I'm not a huge fan of the taste.

80
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,510
I don't know.

81
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,670
I personally don't understand the appeal of Nutella in general.

82
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,670
But I think it's just because I never grew up with it.

83
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,730
So I never had the nostalgia of Nutella in general.

84
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,690
There's another type of food that I also never grew up with.

85
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,950
I'm trying to...

86
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,930
There's a childhood food a lot of people in NA really like.

87
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,070
But because I never grew up with that childhood food.

88
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,450
I've never liked it.

89
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,390
I'm trying to remember what it's called.

90
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,730
There's like this...

91
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,870
There's like a specific childhood food that a lot of people talk about how much they like it.

92
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,070
But I never liked it because...

93
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,910
Peanut butter!

94
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,050
I hate peanut butter.

95
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,410
Maybe I just don't like nuts.

96
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,730
I feel like...

97
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,150
I feel like there's a pattern.

98
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,410
I've never grew up with peanut butter.

99
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,150
Because first off, I'm Asian.

100
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,650
I feel like peanut butter is not an Asian thing.

101
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,850
But like...

102
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,950
I never...

103
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,330
I never grew up with peanut butter.

104
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,630
So like when I first tried peanut butter...

105
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,210
When I first tried peanut butter in like...

106
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,830
I think like almost high school.

107
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,010
I think like middle school.

108
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,170
I just didn't like it.

109
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,670
I just felt it was...

110
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,830
It's such a weird taste.

111
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,690
I guess it's just a nutty taste.

112
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,750
The nut taste in the...

113
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,790
In like...

114
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,230
I don't know.

115
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,490
It's just such a weird taste for me.

116
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,910
So like that's why I never liked peanut butter in general.

117
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,730
I tried crunchy peanut butter.

118
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,850
I tried cream peanut butter.

119
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,550
I tried smooth peanut butter.

120
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,370
I just don't like it.

121
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:53,970
I just...

122
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,770
Same with Nutella.

123
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,910
I just...

124
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,270
I just don't like it.

125
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,810
It's just not for me.

126
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,990
It's just...

127
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,710
It's not bitter.

128
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,330
It's just too nutty.

129
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,090
Like the...

130
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,230
I just don't like the taste of the nuts.

131
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:06,850
Like...

132
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,430
No matter what nut.

133
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,910
I don't like jam either.

134
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,710
I don't like jam that much as well.

135
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,470
Because like...

136
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,870
I guess if it's like...

137
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,690
Yeah.

138
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,990
I don't like jam as well.

139
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,230
Like a lot of these are just like stuff I never...

140
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,130
I never grew up with.

141
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,670
I never grew up with...

142
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:30,910
Yeah.

143
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,090
No.

144
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,330
Fuck.

145
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,170
I cannot.

146
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,130
I don't like Reese's cups.

147
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:34,810
I...

148
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,650
It's because it's peanut butter.

149
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,670
I could taste the peanut butter in Reese's...

150
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,850
Like Reese's cups.

151
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,850
So like it's just...

152
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,750
It's just not for me.

153
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,370
It's just...

154
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,450
It's such a weird like taste.

155
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,170
Like that my taste buds are not used to it at all.

156
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,270
So like...

157
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,670
I just...

158
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,470
I just can't like it at all.

159
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,490
I can't.

160
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,410
It's just...

161
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,930
It's just a very weird taste for my taste buds.

162
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,410
So like I could never get used to it at all.

163
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:03,630
Um...

164
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,470
Um...

165
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,870
I wanted to give a life update.

166
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,250
Oh yeah.

167
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,150
Welcome back Brazil.

168
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,590
Welcome back.

169
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,550
Uh...

170
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,610
I see that...

171
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,390
You know...

172
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,290
They ended up not banning Twitter.

173
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,430
So...

174
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,990
I like...

175
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,970
Welcome back.

176
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,630
I...

177
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,370
They...

178
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:20,710
Yeah.

179
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,510
Yeah.

180
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,410
They're like...

181
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,810
JK.

182
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,210

00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,750
Yeah.

184
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,450
They literally was like...

185
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,770
I remember I saw it on Twitter.

186
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:28,870
Like I...

187
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,730
I get all my news on Twitter by the way.

188
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,910
I don't know what's worse.

189
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,150
Me getting all my news on Twitter.

190
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,010
Or you guys getting all the news from me.

191
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,410
Who gets it from Twitter.

192
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,370
Uh...

193
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,630
But basically...

194
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,850
Brazil's back on Twitter guys.

195
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,050
Um...

196
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,430
They're...

197
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,710
The judge was like...

198
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,830
The judge and Ilan was like...

199
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,130
JK.

200
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,190
Uh...

201
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,450
We'll give you guys more time.

202
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,830
JK everybody.

203
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,890
It never happened.

204
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,990
That's the thing.

205
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,690
I don't think the...

206
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,930
I don't think like...

207
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,730
The ban actually happened.

208
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,730
I think they were just saying it.

209
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,450
And then like...

210
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,490
They just didn't do it.

211
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,270
It was like...

212
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,510
They were playing like chicken.

213
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,390
And...

214
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,990
Trying to see like who's gonna...

215
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,270
Who's gonna basically chicken out first.

216
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,610
But then like...

217
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,750
You know...

218
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:18,990
Uh...

219
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,330
Oh you still can't use it.

220
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:20,650
Oh!

221
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,230
Okay.

222
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,490
It ain't back yet.

223
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,270
Oh it's gonna come back soon.

224
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,310
Apparently.

225
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,610
Um...

226
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,690
Oh no it happened.

227
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,330

228
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,350

229
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,150

230
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,970

232
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,300
Okay I can't believe you guys believe me.

233
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,280
What the fuck did I read?

234
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,100
Like...

235
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,460
What the fuck did...

236
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:51,950
Mis...

237
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,550
Spreading misinformation on the internet Doki?

238
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,490
How could you?

239
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,430
Wait what the fuck did I read?

240
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,090
I saw like a meme.

241
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,250
Guys.

242
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,170
I saw like a Brazil meme.

243
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,890
Like...

244
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,570
I saw a Brazil meme.

245
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,950
And I thought it was funny.

246
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,950
I was like whoa they're back?

247
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,150
Like...

248
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,210
I was like oh Brazil's back on Twitter.

249
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,030
It was a funny meme too.

250
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,570
It was a funny meme.

251
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,010
Haha.

252
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,070
Yeah.

253
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,630
Like they...

254
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,630
Cause it...

255
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,690
Cause it was a quote retweet from a news article.

256
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,930
So I was like oh that's funny.

257
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,730

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,150
Haha.

00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,570
That's a funny meme.

00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:37,970
It...

261
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,110
It quote retweeted an article.

262
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,010
Sorry Brazil.

263
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,490

264
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,310

00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,790
Anyway.

277
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:57,490
Uh...

278
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,490

279
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,590

280
00:12:59,650 --> 00:12:59,890

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,310
Thank you.

282
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,010
It's my birthday and I sent a super chat.

283
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,150
That means you have to sing.

284
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:03,910
Happy birthday.

285
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,070
Thank you for the super chat.

286
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,430
Thank you.

287
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:05,970
Thank you.

288
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,610
Happy birthday to you.

289
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,430
Happy birthday to you.

290
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,290
Happy birthday dear James.

291
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,930
Happy birthday to you.

292
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,270
Yeah!

293
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,290
To be fair, memes are the best form of news.

294
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,230
Cause like we live in a society now where...

295
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,970
Uh...

296
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,950
Which is pretty fucked.

297
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,430
Um...

298
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,870
Haha.

299
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,310
We...

300
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,350
We...

301
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:34,950
We live in a society now that the only way a lot of us can process news if it's presented in a meme form.

302
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,130
And that...

303
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,430
That...

304
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:36,870
Like...

305
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,130
It...

306
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:37,490
Okay.

307
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,690
It's not sort of...

308
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,690
It's just pretty fucked.

309
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,930
My brain cannot comprehend real news anymore unless it's put...

310
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,530
Unless it's pasted onto a funny video.

311
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,870
Or like...

312
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,870
Onto a funny relatable video.

313
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,750
Or if it has like...

314
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,070
Um...

315
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,630
You know...

316
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,190
White text with black...

317
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,350
With black outlines.

318
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,670
Uh...

319
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,270
Under...

320
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,990
On top of a funny picture.

321
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,810
Uh...

322
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,510
I still follow the news?

323
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,690
Oh my god.

324
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,270
He's like the chosen one.

325
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:15,970
Like...

326
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,150
It's like...

327
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,330
It's basically like...

328
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:19,730
Nine...

329
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,190
Like...

330
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,570
Um...

331
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,350
Like this anti...

332
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,030
Uh...

333
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,410
This...

334
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,050
Uh...

335
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,970
What was it called?

336
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,690
This hand sanitizer kills 99% of the bacteria.

337
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,670
You're like that 1% that's still alive.

338
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,530
Uh...

339
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,790
Or he's still alive.

340
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,770
He's just old.

341
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,230
Damn.

342
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,090
Damn.

343
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,410
That's fucked guys.

344
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,910
That's really fucked.

345
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,350
Um...

346
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,350
Anyway.

347
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,430
Um...

348
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,070
Another news.

349
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,190
Um...

350
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,290
I've been practicing for Sajam Slam.

351
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,470
Like last night.

352
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,650
Um...

353
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,270
So...

354
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,090
Bad news.

355
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:56,790
Um...

356
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,390
Usually...

357
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,270
I play...

358
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,890
Um...

359
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,630
Usually...

360
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,550
I play like...

361
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,630
These fighting games.

362
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,710
Super late at night.

363
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,430
Like...

364
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,330
After I've done...

365
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:05,790
Everything.

366
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,710
Um...

367
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,890
After I've done everything.

368
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,130
Uh...

369
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,810
But...

370
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,350
Uh...

371
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,270
The thing is...

372
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,390
Cause I'm very used to it.

373
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,530
I'm very used to just like...

374
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,490
Do grinding hours.

375
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,670
Um...

376
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,270
At like...

377
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,310
Dgen hour times.

378
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,050
Like...

379
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,930
After 10.

380
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,910
Um...

381
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,850
That's when I start playing.

382
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,070
Cause that's what I did for King.

383
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:23,810
For Tekken.

384
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:24,790
Um...

385
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,610
Apparently my coach is a normal human being.

386
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,570
Uh...

387
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,170
Like...

388
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,490
He has an actual...

389
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,250
Bedtime.

390
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,690
And he's a functioning member.

391
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,290
Of society.

392
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,590
Uh...

393
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,150
So...

394
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,150
I was told.

395
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,390
Not even from...

396
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,050
The coach...

397
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,410
Himself.

398
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,550
But like...

399
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,810
Bra Pro told me.

400
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,030
And he was like...

401
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,390
So...

402
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,070
Bad news.

403
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,210
Um...

404
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:45,690
His...

405
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,970
Office hours...

406
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,470
Are...

407
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,390
Ends...

408
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,010
At 10pm CST.

409
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,150
Which is...

410
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,110
8pm PST.

411
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,850
For me.

412
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,530
And I was like...

413
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,490
What the f...

414
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,590
What the f...

415
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,150
I was like...

416
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,370
What do you mean?

417
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,190
8pm PST.

418
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:03,750
That's...

419
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:03,950
Like...

420
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,210
What the f...

421
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,050
Do you mean?

422
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:07,950
Like...

423
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,230
I'd still be streaming.

424
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,070
At those hours.

425
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,830
Um...

426
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,430
I was like...

427
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,070
Who the f...

428
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,990
Lives in C...

429
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,870
He lives in Central.

430
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,230
There's some people that actually live in Central, guys.

431
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,430
That's where the mountains are.

432
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,090
Um...

433
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,830
Um...

434
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,550
And...

435
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:29,950
So...

436
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,610
Like...

437
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:30,970
Uh...

438
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,430
So...

439
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,530
Right now...

440
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:32,870
Well...

441
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,730
Tomorrow is my first day.

442
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,530
So...

443
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,290
Maybe...

444
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:35,910
Uh...

445
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:36,830
Maybe...

446
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,230
Like...

447
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:37,310
Yeah...

448
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,450
Texas is the entire Central at this point.

449
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,430
Because Texas is the size of two f...

450
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,470
European countries.

451
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,150
Uh...

452
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:44,830
Anyway...

453
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,630
Anyway...

454
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,370
So...

455
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,750
This is our current solution.

456
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,090
Um...

457
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,570
Cause...

458
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,950
BrawlPro is main in GEEF as well.

459
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:52,750
So...

460
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,150
Like...

461
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,230
Brian...

462
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,670
Will be coaching BrawlPro.

463
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,310
And then...

464
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,610
I'm grabbing second hand knowledge from BrawlPro.

465
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,450
So...

466
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:00,890
Like...

467
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,930
So...

468
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,030
He's just dumping the information to me.

469
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,290
As like...

470
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,310
Second hand.

471
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,310
Like...

472
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,710
It's not very ideal.

473
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,750
I would say.

474
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,970
It's not ideal at all.

475
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,990
Like...

476
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,210
Um...

477
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,030
But...

478
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,810
But...

479
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:18,930
Like...

480
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,610
For now...

481
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,290
This is like...

482
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,370
Our current solution.

483
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,890
The hand me down education.

484
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,210
Yeah...

485
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:25,590
It's...

486
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,350
It's telephone coaching.

487
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,010
Cause...

488
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,470
At like...

489
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,170
5 in the morning...

490
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:31,650
Um...

491
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:31,910
During...

492
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,030
So...

493
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,750
I kept bumping into like...

494
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,530
J...

495
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:34,790
Like...

496
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,870
These 3 characters.

497
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,690
Jamie...

498
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,390
Ken...

499
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:37,790
And...

500
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,090
Julie.

501
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,110
I kept doing this...

502
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,710
Stupid ass move!

503
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,030
Called...

504
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,870
Apparently...

505
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,070
And I had to like...

506
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,530
Like...

507
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,230
And then I had to...

508
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,930
I was like...

509
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,090
I...

510
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,450
Like...

511
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,690
BrawlPro was still awake at 4 in the morning.

512
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,770
Thank fucking god.

513
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,810
Cause he's a degenerate.

514
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,450
Uh...

515
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:54,990
Like...

516
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,750
Degenerate.

517
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,450
Quote on quote.

518
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,130
Not negatively.

519
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,190
Hahaha!

520
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,410
Hahaha!

521
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,650
Not in a negative way.

522
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:05,970
Bracket.

523
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,250
Um...

524
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,950
And...

525
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,230
And...

526
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,010
It's called...

527
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,470
Like...

528
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,110
It's called a throw loop.

529
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,830
So...

530
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,370
Like...

531
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:13,990
Um...

532
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,750
So...

533
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,110
Like...

534
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,510
I was so fucking tilted.

535
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,910
Cause I kept getting...

536
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,350
This...

537
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,830
This...

538
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,110
Mo...

539
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,070
Kept doing...

540
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,390
Getting...

541
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,870
Uh...

542
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,150
Sorry.

543
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,410
English.

544
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,110
My brain is not working right now.

545
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:23,750
Um...

546
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,290
Hahaha!

547
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,470
So...

548
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,250
They kept doing this thing called a...

549
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,530
Throw loop.

550
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,830
And it was fucking tilting me.

551
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,890
Cause I have no idea what it was.

552
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,850
And I lost so many rank points from it.

553
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,430
Because they realized...

554
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,990
I was just gonna spam throws all the time.

555
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:40,490
Like...

556
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,610
I wasn't doing any other moves.

557
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,570
I was just spamming throws.

558
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,650
By the way...

559
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,630
I'm almost silver rank.

560
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,530
I have no idea what I'm doing.

561
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,650
But like...

562
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,050
In...

563
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,750
In like...

564
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,410
5 hours...

565
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,030
I'm almost silver rank right now.

566
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,870
But like...

567
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,730
I literally don't know what I'm doing.

568
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,090
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

569
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:55,670
Hahaha!

570
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,070
Hahaha!

571
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,730
I had like...

572
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,550
At one point...

573
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,230
I think my longest win streak was like...

574
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,510
8 wins in a row.

575
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,770
I got 8...

576
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,110
Cause apparently the more wins you get...

577
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,850
The more rank points you earn.

578
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,150
So like...

579
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,510
Uh...

580
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,990
So like...

581
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,750
I instantly got from like...

582
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,410
Iron...

583
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,470
To like...

584
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,010
Uh...

585
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,050
I got passed through iron like...

586
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,370
Super fucking fast.

587
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,230
Um...

588
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,110
Because I got like...

589
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,950
8 wins in a row.

590
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,850
So like...

591
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,310
It like...

592
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:23,790
I was like...

593
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,030
It's like...

594
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,750
Plus 50...

595
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,470
Plus 100...

596
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,310
Plus 250...

597
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,270
Shit like that.

598
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,770
So the longer the win streak...

599
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,010
The more rank points you get.

600
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,990
So I got out of iron like...

601
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,570
Super fast.

602
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:33,890
Uh...

603
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,330
Um...

604
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,270
And so like...

605
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,470
I'm almost silver right now.

606
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,230
I got to bronze.

607
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:37,830
I'm like...

608
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,970
I think I'm like bronze...

609
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,390
4?

610
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,150
I think?

611
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,150
I'm bronze 4 at the moment.

612
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,410
So I need to be like...

613
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,090
I need like...

614
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,370
A star and a...

615
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,050
Like 2 more stars to be silver.

616
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,190
Um...

617
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,690
But I have no idea what I'm doing by the way.

618
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:50,990
Like...

619
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,550
All I did...

620
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,230
Was...

621
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,430
Spam throws.

622
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,710
As modern gif.

623
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,090
Like...

624
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,450
I don't know what's going on.

625
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:57,790
Like...

626
00:19:59,290 --> 00:19:59,850
But...

627
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,810
I know how to counter those...

628
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,950
God damn...

629
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,590
Fucking...

630
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,270
Throw loops.

631
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:04,930
Cause...

632
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,930
That shit tilt...

633
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,030
I was so mad.

634
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,050
I was so...

635
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:08,970
Fucking mad.

636
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:09,810
Like...

637
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,450
And I kept...

638
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,070
And I was like...

639
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,870
Trying to figure out...

640
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,890
What that was.

641
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,210
Cause I was like...

642
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,690
What the fuck is that move?

643
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,690
Like...

644
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,950
What is that move?

645
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,870
And I was trying to look it up.

646
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:21,930
I was like...

647
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,710
I was trying to look it up on YouTube.

648
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,150
Cause I was like...

649
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,810
I don't have a coach right now.

650
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,570
So...

651
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,330
I was trying to...

652
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,110
I was looking up...

653
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,130
Looking up on it on YouTube.

654
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,890
And um...

655
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,450
And you know what I got on YouTube?

656
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,110
All I kept getting...

657
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,010
All I kept getting is like...

658
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,290
How to counter a gif.

659
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,270
How to get out of zangiefs grapples.

660
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:42,970
I'm like...

661
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,910
I played a zangief.

662
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,970
I'm getting grappled right now.

663
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:47,970
Like...

664
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,810
Like...

665
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,930
I don't get it.

666
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:51,930
I'm here!

667
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,530
I'm nearly- I'm the one that's getting gap rep!

668
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,670
I am the key!

669
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,870
I need to figure out how to get out of this!

670
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,630
Like, I don't understand!

671
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,330
So I was like, thank god.

672
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,130
I think like, BroadPro was like, in bed checking his phone or whatever.

673
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,930
Cause I was like, please, SOS.

674
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,450
I don't know what the fuck they're doing right now.

675
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,190
But I need you to tell me how to counter this.

676
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,090
Cause I cannot deal with this!

677
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,810
And then he like, literally- cause he was like, okay, what does it look like?

678
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,410
And I was like, I don't know, here's a recording.

679
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,250
And then he would have to like, okay, he's like, okay, I need to get on the game to figure this out too.

680
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:43,890
And so, yeah, so basically, I just need to do a normal grab back on him.

681
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,250
And back on those- I figured it out!

682
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,890
You know, he had to get back on Street Fighter.

683
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,830
Um, he had to get back on Street Fighter to like, teach me.

684
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:56,610
And I made him get back up at like, 4 in the morning.

685
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,590
To be fair, it was also 6 in the morning for him as well.

686
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,610
So I could get out of that throw loop!

687
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,470
Like, fuck the throw loop!

688
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,410
I'm supposed to loop you!

689
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,190
You're like, you're not supposed to loop me!

690
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,810
Like, how dare you!

691
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,210
I'm the grappler!

692
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,310
But yeah, I figured it out.

693
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,890
Um, you know what sucks?

694
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,890
Everybody is now purposely training to counter me.

695
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,470
Like, this is so fucked.

696
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,230
Like, it's me against the world!

697
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:38,490
It's literally me- people literally swap- swap their mains just to counter me!

698
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,250
It's so fucked up!

699
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,010
I'm just like, I'm not even good!

700
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:44,750
Like...

701
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,630
Like...

702
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,830
Like, I'm not even good at thi- It's because of my clip that went viral!

703
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,870
Like...

704
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:05,540
Like, the- the fucking clip also went- like, went viral in the FGC community!

705
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:12,560
So now all the new players, all the beginner players, are purposely training against me!

706
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,620
And I'm so mad!

707
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,640
Like...

708
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,020
I don't know what I'm doing!

709
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,080
Like...

710
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,480
Dayplay...

711
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,000
I...

712
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,680
Like, I don't understand!

713
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,080
Why is everyone training against me?

714
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,960
Oh my god...

715
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,040
Like, there's so many other new players!

716
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,440
Like...

717
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,660
There's like five other players!

718
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,160
But they're all training against Keef!

719
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,040
It just doesn't make sense!

720
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:54,940
Like...

721
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,140
Yeah, anyway...

722
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,920
Um...

723
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,440
They don't wanna be the next Akumi...

724
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,240
Um...

725
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,000
Sorry, I had to rat that out.

726
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:14,400
Cause I had- I had to- I had to, like, let that out real quick, by the way, guys.

727
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,040
Like...

728
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,460
I'm sorry we haven't started the game yet.

729
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,940
I know I was like- I was also, like, twenty minutes late.

730
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,400
And now, like, it's almost six p.m.

731
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,160
And I still haven't started the game.

732
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,020
Oh yeah.

733
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,700
Before...

734
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,220
Before- The crap I experienced!

735
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,460
Okay.

736
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,020
Before I start the stream- This game...

737
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,540
Um...

738
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,900
I wanna show you guys this comment I got.

739
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,200
Which I thought was the funniest- Like...

740
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,040
I-I-I don't even know, like, what they were trying to imply.

741
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,260
But, like...

742
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,100
I honestly thought it was, like, one of the funniest comments I got for Wukong.

743
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,560
But also, like...

744
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,200
Fuck you.

745
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,000
It was like...

746
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,900
It was like...

747
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,000
What the fuck?

748
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,640
But also, fuck you.

749
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:04,980
Okay.

750
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,020
Um...

751
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,700
Alright.

752
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,980
I mean, I'm not gonna bother hiding the name.

753
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,860
Because it's literally, like, on my Wukong pod.

754
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,700
Like...

755
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,080
But, like, I'm gonna save this real fast.

756
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,580
Okay, I need to show you guys this.

757
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,360
Like...

758
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,920
I was like...

759
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,460
What does that- What are you trying to imply, bro?

760
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,600
Like...

761
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,360
Okay.

762
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,240
Okay.

763
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,980
This is it.

764
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,860
Uh...

765
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,060
Oh, my God.

766
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,740
I have to say she is too weak.

767
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,940
I've seen many girls play Black Myth.

768
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,100
Their evasion and skills are good.

769
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,560
But Doki died five times just to fight a damn ice cream farm.

770
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:52,200
I have to say Doki's skill is too bad.

771
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,240
I don't know if it's- Bro, I fucking swear.

772
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,700
This bait.

773
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,780
Like, he did it.

774
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,580
He got- I got baited.

775
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,340
Um...

776
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,820
If this is engagement bait, he won.

777
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,700
Um...

778
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:13,960
Is she deliberately performing being abused by monsters increased the number of viewers?

779
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,460
Smile.

780
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,340
The passive-aggressive fucking smile.

781
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,220
He successfully engaged- Rage- Like, rage baited me.

782
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:42,500
Anyway, I just want to say- I just want to say- I fucking first tried so many bosses that were considered quote-unquote hard.

783
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,780
But the one time- I fucking struggled.

784
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:56,800
I fucking- Like, the fucking one time, I actually struggled.

785
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:10,320
They're like- Is she purposely performing bad just for more viewers?

786
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,520
Like, the fucking- Bro!

787
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:12,760
Oh no!

788
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,160
I wish I could first try more!

789
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,100
Oh my god.

790
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,380
Anyway, sorry.

791
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,900
Like, I got engagement baited.

792
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,360
So I had to like...

793
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,280
I had to show it.

794
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,780
They're waiting for reviews.

795
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,060
I fucking knew it.

796
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,500
I fucking knew she was better than...

797
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:50,940
Guys, honestly, if you guys think I'm actually like, if you guys really think I'm actually like, you know, performing worse for views, I'm really happy you think I'm actually really good at these video games.

798
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,380
Like...

799
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm glad you guys think I'm...

800
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,220
I'm glad you guys think you have this vision of me being like a gaming savant.

801
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,920
That really helps my EO.

802
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,800
Like...

803
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
It really helps my EO.

804
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,220
Alright.

805
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,880
Let's play Wukong.

806
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,840
It's Wukong time.

807
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,220
Um...

808
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,620
Alright.

809
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,860
Into the land of bugs.

810
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,340
Here we go.

811
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,300
Alright.

812
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,740
We return to monkey.

813
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,960
It's monkey time.

814
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,160
Time to go for more viewers again.

815
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,520
How did he know?

816
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,900
How did he fucking know?

817
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,240
That's why I'm gamer of the year, guys.

818
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,400
That's why I'm gamer of the year, guys.

819
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:51,760
Okay.

820
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,880
I guess we go this way.

821
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,220
Okay.

822
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,220
I guess we go this way.

823
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,480
Alright.

824
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,200
Off we go.

825
00:28:59,340 --> 00:28:59,900
What?

826
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,280
Here?

827
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:00,580
What?

828
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Here?

829
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,280
I wanna explore first.

830
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,240
I don't know.

831
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,760
Should I explore or like...

832
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,860
Should I just go in now?

833
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,620
Just got exposed.

834
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,780
What?

835
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,260
You're gonna give me a key?

836
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,620
You're gonna give me a key?

837
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,340
Oh?

838
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,600
Whoa!

839
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:22,720
Whoa!

840
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,060
Wait.

841
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,520
What?

842
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,500
Friend?

843
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,000
Wait.

844
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What?

845
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Friend?

846
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,800
Oh my god.

847
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,240
I'm big.

848
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,900
New form?

849
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,590
New form?

850
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,370
Oh!

851
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,550
Is that Pigsy?

852
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,090
Did he?

853
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,730
Did he transform?

854
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,710
Like, who the fuck is...

855
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,950
Is that... Is that JuBakGuy?

856
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,490
Yeah, I was gonna say, did he transform?

857
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,910
Yeah, I was like, what the...

858
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,670
Oh my god.

859
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,650
Am I wearing pants?

860
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,630
Oh, I'm not wearing pants.

861
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,230
I'm not.

862
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,510
We're both not wearing pants.

863
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,260
Oh!

864
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,920
Oh, it was a trap!

865
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,680
What?

866
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,520
Woman?

867
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,480
Woman?

868
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,100
How did you two come this late?

869
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:30,500
How did you two come this late?

870
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,840
Your wife didn't come again this time?

871
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,860
Your wife didn't come again this time?

872
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,200
Uh, my wife is short in status.

873
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,260
It's inconvenient for her to show up in the next world.

874
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,120
It's inconvenient for her to show up in the next world.

875
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,660
But in her heart, she always cares about you guys.

876
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,600
But in her heart, she always cares about you guys.

877
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,740
My wife told me.

878
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,560
I hope my daughter recovers soon.

879
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,920
I hope she can go to heaven soon.

880
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,020
Oh, Zoom subs.

881
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,200
I thought I had it on.

882
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,480
Sorry, guys.

883
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,260
Hahaha.

884
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,480
And now...

885
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,480
Li was stolen.

886
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,320
Ren was killed.

887
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,620
How about...

888
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:16,900
What?

889
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,440
What?

890
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,060
What did I do?

891
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,840
I'm just a monkey.

892
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,540
A pig.

893
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,420
I'm just a piggy.

894
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,060
I know I'm lagging on the casino.

895
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,140
How did you know?

896
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,480
I'm just a piggy.

897
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,160
I'm a pig.

898
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,640
I don't know.

899
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,180
I'm a pig.

900
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,600
I don't know.

901
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,740
I don't know.

902
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,480
No.

903
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,660
You have to be more specific.

904
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,600
He ruined a lot of ladies' lives.

905
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,780
You have to be more specific.

906
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,800
He's fucked over a lot of people.

907
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,020
You have to be more specific.

908
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,720
He's fucked over a lot of ladies' lives.

909
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:39,720
You have to be more specific.

910
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,020
He's fucked over a lot of ladies' lives.

911
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,300
And this is the first sentence.

912
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:49,800
He's fucked over a lot of ladies' lives.

913
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:49,960
All right.

914
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,920
Big attack time.

915
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,360
Oh, yeah.

916
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,540
Oh, yeah.

917
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,580
I don't know how I feel about this spider.

918
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,180
Please, please help me.

919
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,120
This is your problem.

920
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,280
This is your issue.

921
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,120
Like, why am I involved in your family problems?

922
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,780
It's all right, guys.

923
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,360
Even if we kill her, it's fine.

924
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,620
Like, I don't know if you guys know this, but spiders have a lot of babies.

925
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,920
So, I don't think that mom would care, you know?

926
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,100
Like, I mean, I don't think she'll remember.

927
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,920
Why is it my issue?

928
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,140
I'm literally... I'm the tourist.

929
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,240
I'm just sightseeing.

930
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,520
Oh, shit.

931
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,360
Okay.

932
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,500
All right.

933
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,520
Guys, you know, like... No, this is absolutely... At least grounded, you can, like, turn on...

934
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,500
You can turn on, like... What was it called?

935
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,220
Arachnophobia?

936
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,360
So, they look like boxes, but you can't do that for this game.

937
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,060
All right.

938
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,600
What's his name?

939
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,480
What was his name again?

940
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,160
What was your name?

941
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,880
All right, darling.

942
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,940
Fucking first try.

943
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,680
That's right.

944
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,860
A fucking first try.

945
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,140
Fucking ice cream frog.

946
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,620
Fucking ice cream frog.

947
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,300
No, Doki.

948
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,720
You're killing her too... Killing them too fast.

949
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,640
How else are you gonna get the views?

950
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,460
Doki will remember that.

951
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,380
What if he just likes hanging out with monkeys?

952
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,140
Yes, he clearly has a preference.

953
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,220
Spiders and monkeys.

954
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,300
I'm not scared.

955
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,580
Jesus.

956
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,980
What did you do?

957
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,960
What did you do?

958
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,440
Oh, my God.

959
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,940
What did you do in this area, Chewbacca?

960
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:20,000
Like, why do you hold such a huge grudge against... I mean, to be fair, like, spiders...

961
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,840
They're spiders, so...

962
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,460
Spider lives do not matter.

963
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:33,620
Yes, I know they're very good for the environment, but I will never change my opinion.

964
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,500
I...

965
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,280
As long as they are not near me, I don't mind.

966
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,600
If they're not near me, they live.

967
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,440
To be fair, I won't be the one killing them.

968
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,940
It would be, like, somebody...

969
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
They would just...

970
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,220
You know what?

971
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,840
No, I don't know why I'm being so cocky about that.

972
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,080
Because if I see a spider in my room, it's their room now.

973
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,680
Like, it's not even my room anymore.

974
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,220
Like, I once, like...

975
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:08,960
I remember, like, when I used to live in Asia, there was a spider in the bathroom.

976
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,920
And then I...

977
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,880
And then I just used my parents' bathroom.

978
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:20,100
I used my parents' bathroom for, like, two plus weeks until, like...

979
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,420
Until it was safe to go back in.

980
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,080
Because in my head, I was like, it must have starved to death by now.

981
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,620
Alright, let's see.

982
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,640
Let's take a sip.

983
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,680
I'm gonna look at the graphics, because I don't know why I'm lagging during cutscenes.

984
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,820
Every day.

985
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,720
Every day there's something new.

986
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,240
And I know...

987
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,480
Every day there's just something new here.

988
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,500
Okay.

989
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,860
Alright.

990
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,040
Here we go.

991
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,960
Just gotta deal with the newest...

992
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,980
The newest thing in the world.

993
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,460
It's just like me.

994
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,040
Alright, here we go.

995
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,820
The crash of 64.

996
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:19,780
Ever since the crash of 64, nothing has been the same since...

997
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,600
Oh hey, nice.

998
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,400
Ooh, materials.

999
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,160
Okay, but I...

1000
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,620
I don't like playing with 60 frames.

1001
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,200
It's...

1002
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
Oh yeah, I should use this.

1003
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,520
Means for a short time after casting a spell...

1004
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,140
Let me charge up to 4 within...

1005
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,980
Wait, I should get this.

1006
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,440
Modern Extended Dodge Env...

1007
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,180
Yeah, wait.

1008
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,680
That's good.

1009
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,860
Hold breath.

1010
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,280
I can't.

1011
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,840
I can't.

1012
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,140
I tried it for like 2 seconds and I can't.

1013
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,940
I can't do this.

1014
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,360
I can't do this.

1015
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,380
I'm not strong enough, I'm sorry.

1016
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,620
I'm not strong enough.

1017
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,340
I couldn't.

1018
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:06,960
I tried.

1019
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,120
Like 2 seconds.

1020
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,100
And I had...

1021
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,860
I won't...

1022
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,140
My body had like a negative reaction to it.

1023
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:13,740
Like...

1024
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,120
Doki.

1025
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,380
No shadows?

1026
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,600
Okay, we'll do low.

1027
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,940
Maybe this will fix it.

1028
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,600
Maybe this will fix everything.

1029
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,580
Okay.

1030
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,320
I...

1031
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,040
No, I would.

1032
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,740
I would...

1033
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,120
I would...

1034
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,920
I would rather die.

1035
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,300
It's...

1036
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,240
It's not even like...

1037
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:35,980
It's not...

1038
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,860
It's just my body would actually shut down.

1039
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,100
I would...

1040
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,580
Like...

1041
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:44,020
If I play a game with too low frames, my body would actually shut down.

1042
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:44,640
Like...

1043
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,400
I cannot handle that.

1044
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,740
Like my organs will start to fail.

1045
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,300
It just cannot look at something that has less than 60 frames.

1046
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,800
Or that has less than 100 frames.

1047
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,380
No, it won't.

1048
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,240
How would you know that?

1049
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,420
You don't know my body.

1050
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,080
Okay, let's see.

1051
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,840
Is this stronger?

1052
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,780
Oh, it's stronger!

1053
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,000
Gold Tree Core?

1054
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,660
How the fuck do I get a Gold Tree Core?

1055
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,120
Okay.

1056
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,960
Oh, wait!

1057
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,420
I could craft this right now.

1058
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,300
80%.

1059
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:21,820
108?

1060
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,140
Holy fuck.

1061
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,220
Okay, I'm gonna grab this first.

1062
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,420
Um, because it's 80 anyway.

1063
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,040
Wait, am I...

1064
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,340
Okay.

1065
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,360
I have the Ice Staff, so...

1066
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,020
Wait, what do I have?

1067
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,580
I have 75.

1068
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,180
Okay.

1069
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,160
I am going to grab...

1070
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,080
Okay.

1071
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,080
I'll grab this one.

1072
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,180
Yes, I'm allergic.

1073
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,000
I am...

1074
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:53,420
I have a doctor's note that tells people that I am severely allergic to 100 frames per second.

1075
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:58,140
That anything that's less than 100 frames per second, I will have a very bad allergic reaction.

1076
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,840
It's just...

1077
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,180
I was just born that way, sadly.

1078
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,320
When the doctors were like, it's incurable.

1079
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,340
It's so sad.

1080
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,600
Even the doctors were like, there's nothing we can do about it.

1081
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,720
She has to live with this curse.

1082
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,460
For the rest of her life.

1083
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,120
You think...

1084
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
You think I want to live like this?

1085
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:36,400
You really th- This is not... I did consent to live like this.

1086
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,720
Oh my god, there's too many bugs!

1087
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,080
Oh my god.

1088
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,520
Oh god.

1089
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,320
Okay.

1090
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,180
Jesus Christ, these guys are so annoying!

1091
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,520
Oh shit, okay.

1092
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,620
No, please don't let me die to a mob.

1093
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,080
Please don't let me die to a mob.

1094
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,660
Bugs for days.

1095
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,280
Oh my god, I hate that they swarm.

1096
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,200
I hate it.

1097
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,260
It's so fucking annoying.

1098
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,340
Alright, I don't know where to... I feel like there's stuff I missed.

1099
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,280
There's so many things around me.

1100
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,880
Wait, what the fuck is that?

1101
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,000
Oh, it's a spider.

1102
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,360
Oh, they're baby spiders!

1103
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,060
Oh, that is a lot.

1104
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,500
I got baited.

1105
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,180
I got baited!

1106
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,760
I got baited!

1107
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,360
I got baited!

1108
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,940
I got baited!

1109
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,480
Okay.

1110
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,860
How are you so strong?

1111
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,660
You're just babies!

1112
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,620
Oh, it's because they're rock babies!

1113
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,080
Okay.

1114
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,800
I got baited so fucking hard there.

1115
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:39,980
Alright.

1116
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,840
Absorb.

1117
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,660
I have no more... I have no more items anymore.

1118
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,560
I swear to god!

1119
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,820
Right after!

1120
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,940
That's fucked.

1121
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,720
I can't believe it.

1122
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,500
I can't believe it.

1123
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,860
Not only were there babies, but there's also fungus, too.

1124
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,680
Okay, nice.

1125
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,640
Okay.

1126
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,400
Easy.

1127
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,340
Wait, did I get poisoned?

1128
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,220
God fucking dammit.

1129
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,360
Okay, that's fine.

1130
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,020
I'm going back because I know I missed some items and stuff.

1131
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,340
Back here.

1132
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,300
Alright, off we go.

1133
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,480
I hope the...

1134
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,320
Yeah, I haven't been here before.

1135
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,720
Oh, yeah, I definitely have not been here.

1136
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,180
Okay, this is like...

1137
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,800
Okay, I might have fucked up a little bit.

1138
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,440
Me here.

1139
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,320
This is... this is pretty bad.

1140
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,320
This is... this is pretty bad.

1141
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,320
This is... oh, this is very bad.

1142
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,020
This is... this is very bad.

1143
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,360
Alright, I'll come back here soon.

1144
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,440
Oh, and now I'm in the water.

1145
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,720
Hello, guys.

1146
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,740
Hey, everybody.

1147
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,660
Oh, oh, and they're gonna try and chase me.

1148
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,120
Okay.

1149
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,200
Alright.

1150
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,200
Instant transmission.

1151
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,960
Oh, am I in a fight?

1152
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,240
Oh, I'm in a fight.

1153
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,580
You can't instant transmission when you're on a fight.

1154
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,520
Did you guys know that?

1155
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,840
I'm gonna take this, though, real quick.

1156
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,540
Is he still following me?

1157
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,600
That'll be very awkward.

1158
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,520
Oh, he's not.

1159
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:13,820
Okay.

1160
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,460
Instant transmission.

1161
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,000
Sorry, I dropped into somebody else's house.

1162
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,260
Alright.

1163
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:35,160
I wish this did have the arachnophobia... the arachnophobia option.

1164
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,300
Because I want to know what it would look like, you know?

1165
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,880
I just want to know what it would look like.

1166
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,900
Because they're always so silly.

1167
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,620
Like, if this entire chapter was just, like, boxes or something.

1168
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,500
No, I just think it looks really funny.

1169
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:53,540
That's really it.

1170
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,860
For the content.

1171
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,160
I just want to know what they would... what they would turn into.

1172
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,500
But we gave them arachnophobia option.

1173
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,020
Alright.

1174
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,440
Asia doesn't care about arachnophobia.

1175
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,360
To be fair, like...

1176
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,140
There's a...

1177
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,600
Oh my god.

1178
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,400
Okay, let me...

1179
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,460
Let me get rid of this.

1180
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1181
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,600
To be fair, if you have arachnophobia...

1182
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,000
And you live in Asia...

1183
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,840
Like, sucks to be you, I guess.

1184
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,340
Like, there's no avoiding that shit.

1185
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,160
Not gonna lie.

1186
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,120
Like, mosquitoes alone...

1187
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,220
Is, like, a problem.

1188
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,800
I remember when...

1189
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,500
I remember when I would watch, like, TVV.

1190
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,340
And I would swear.

1191
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,300
They would play the fucking mosquito.

1192
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,560
The mosquito PSA.

1193
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,740
That was made 20...

1194
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,860
30 years ago.

1195
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,660
I don't know if they still play it.

1196
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,740
But, like, when I used to watch TVV back in, like, Asia...

1197
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,400
Um, they would play this mosquito PSA.

1198
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,900
Like, they would play two...

1199
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,260
Three different mosquito PSAs.

1200
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,820
And, um...

1201
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,800
And, like...

1202
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,400
It was...

1203
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,900
It was filmed, like, 30 plus years ago.

1204
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,840
And they still...

1205
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,220
And they play it non-stop.

1206
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,580
It's like...

1207
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,060
Every 10 minutes...

1208
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,920
They always play the mosquito PSA.

1209
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,580
Because mosquitoes are a huge problem.

1210
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,260
Like...

1211
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,600
It's a fucking huge problem.

1212
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,500
It's like something about, like...

1213
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,320
Oh, remember to, like, change the water underneath the plants.

1214
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,360
Or so the mosquitoes can't lay their eggs.

1215
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,560
Like...

1216
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,440
I don't know where I've been and where I haven't been.

1217
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,740
It's not really that big of, like, a place, too.

1218
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,400
That's the thing.

1219
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:41,640
Wait.

1220
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,040
It's here.

1221
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:42,380
Okay.

1222
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,660
It's over here.

1223
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:49,210
Oh.

1224
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:49,750
All right.

1225
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,670
I'm just gonna run.

1226
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,130
I really don't want to deal...

1227
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,850
These guys are really annoying to fight.

1228
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:54,930
I don't want to deal with them.

1229
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:57,250
Go west.

1230
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:58,890
Right.

1231
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,370
No.

1232
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,950
Left.

1233
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:03,750
Wait.

1234
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:04,130
No.

1235
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,690
West Coast is on the left.

1236
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,530
Guys, I know my left and right.

1237
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:15,150
Guys, I know my left and right, guys.

1238
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:17,550
Okay.

1239
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:20,150
Doki, please throw more.

1240
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,590
We need more people to watch.

1241
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:22,910
Okay.

1242
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:23,890
Okay.

1243
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,130
All right.

1244
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,670
I know!

1245
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,710
West Coast is left.

1246
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,350
North is up.

1247
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,610
South is down.

1248
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,070
And East is right.

1249
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,870
I know I'm west.

1250
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,490
I live in the West Coast.

1251
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,250
So I'm on the left side of the world.

1252
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,470
That's how I know.

1253
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,910
Because West Coast is on the left.

1254
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,050
Wait.

1255
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,110
Am I allowed to go down here?

1256
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:50,330
Oh.

1257
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:50,650
Okay.

1258
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,070
Thank God.

1259
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:51,330
Okay.

1260
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,150
I have zero survival instinct.

1261
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,350
Okay.

1262
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,130
I have no survival instinct.

1263
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,010
This hole looks very dangerous.

1264
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,450
Maybe I should jump down.

1265
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:12,770
Oh, maybe I should not have jumped down.

1266
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,430
Did I die?

1267
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,050
Oh, no.

1268
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:18,850
I'm just Kukun.

1269
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,410
I'm just going to get digested with the spider acid.

1270
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,530
They got me a bed.

1271
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,890
That's nice of them.

1272
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:31,930
All right.

1273
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,430
You're making sure, like, I feel welcome.

1274
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,320
I'm not lagging as much anymore, at least, during cutscenes, I think.

1275
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,640
I can't tell anymore.

1276
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,660
The crash at 24 really fucked up my PC.

1277
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,680
Alright, up here, there's a... I wanna grab the...

1278
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,820
I wanna grab this first before I go anywhere.

1279
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,370
That's how spider monkeys are born.

1280
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:20,830
When a mama spider and a papa monkey love each other very, very much.

1281
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,110
Okay, no, maybe it should be the other way around.

1282
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,830
Maybe it should be the other...

1283
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,830
When a mama monkey and a spider...

1284
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,450
Papa love each other very much.

1285
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,970
They make a spider monkey.

1286
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,320
How it works...

1287
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,440
Well, how do you say...

1288
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,620
How do you think they get chihuahua mixed breeds?

1289
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,960
Okay, let me show you guys.

1290
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,340
I always wonder about this.

1291
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,060
Okay, chihuahua...

1292
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,220
mixed breeds.

1293
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,800
I don't know if you ever...

1294
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,980
Guys, I always wonder how the fuck were they able to make these chihuahua.

1295
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,560
Like, how did they cross a chihuahua and a fucking terrier?

1296
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,460
Like, what...

1297
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,760
Dude, oh my gosh.

1298
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,360
It's like...

1299
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,750
They're such big dogs.

1300
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,480
And I'm like, how did you get a chihuahua?

1301
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,600
To like...

1302
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,600
Like, how does that work?

1303
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,440
I'll never understand.

1304
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,020
Like, I don't...

1305
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,600
I sort of...

1306
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,720
I don't want to also.

1307
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,660
Turkey, no, please.

1308
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,320
Alright, here, let me...

1309
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,200
Okay, so, let me show you a mixed breed.

1310
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,700
I saw one that was like...

1311
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,640
How the fuck...

1312
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,760
I remember seeing one of the mixed breeds.

1313
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,540
And I'm just like...

1314
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,100
How?

1315
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,220
Like, oh!

1316
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,780
Okay, a shib...

1317
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,900
A shib-chi.

1318
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,340
So, they crossed a shiba inu with a chihuahua.

1319
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,140
And we all know how...

1320
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,520
I'm just like thinking, like...

1321
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,500
Which one's the mom and which one's the dad?

1322
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,460
Like...

1323
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,780
Like, look...

1324
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,160
It's...

1325
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,400
I guess, like, he's cute.

1326
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,660
But it's like...

1327
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,000
It's like...

1328
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,480
Which...

1329
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:05,780
It's like...

1330
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,100
He's pretty huge.

1331
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,220
Like, do you guys...

1332
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,000
Okay, alright.

1333
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,960
Let me give you a size comparison.

1334
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:10,220
And...

1335
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,520
A chihuahua.

1336
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,220
Turkey, why do you not stop?

1337
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,760
So...

1338
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,540
So, you guys all know how big a...

1339
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,580
Like, a shi...

1340
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,000
Okay...

1341
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,100
Shiba inu is...

1342
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,480
Shiba inu is compared to a chihuahua.

1343
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,620
Chihuahua is like one-third...

1344
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,860
What?

1345
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,760
Not even one-third!

1346
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,780
It's like one fourth a size.

1347
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,720
So, I'm just like, how?

1348
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,880
How does this?

1349
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,200
How?

1350
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,840
Oh my God!

1351
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,720
There's a Chihuahua German Shepherd?

1352
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,660
Another mix that seems... How?

1353
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,540
It doesn't even look like a Chihuahua at that point.

1354
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,120
Like, how the fuck is... Who's the mom?

1355
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,180
Like, oh my God!

1356
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,080
This is a Chihuahua mix of a German... Okay.

1357
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,600
A German Shepherd next to a Chihu...

1358
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:18,880
I think... Stop contemplating this.

1359
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,000
Alright, guys.

1360
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,360
Okay, this is the last thing.

1361
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,940
This is the last thing I'll send you.

1362
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,220
This is the last... I swear.

1363
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,700
This is the last one, guys.

1364
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,800
I swear.

1365
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,340
I swear.

1366
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:39,060
Wait, there's a sock photo of this to visualize this better.

1367
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,380
This is the size comparison between a...

1368
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:54,140
So, this is a German Shepherd next to a Chihuahua.

1369
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,860
Just so you guys have, like, a proper visualization.

1370
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,960
Of, like...

1371
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,800
Who is the mom?

1372
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,200
Who could be the mom?

1373
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,400
Who... Which one's the mom and which one's the...

1374
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,620
This is a better comparison.

1375
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,520
Which...

1376
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,060
Which one's the mom and which one's the dad?

1377
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,920
Like, so...

1378
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,640
There's a Chihuahua Rottweiler?

1379
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,400
A Chih-whaler?

1380
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,200
Oh my God!

1381
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,920
The Chih-whaler isn't as common as other Chihuahua mixes.

1382
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,420
But there's certain...

1383
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,560
Oh, I wonder why.

1384
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,900
I wonder why Chihuahua and Rottweilers are not a common...

1385
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,040
Not a common Chihuahua mix.

1386
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,740
I wonder why.

1387
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,440
Okay, that is actually worse than the German Shepherd.

1388
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,200
That is...

1389
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,080
That is...

1390
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,200
That is...

1391
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,840
So you're saying skinny...

1392
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,920
Alright, here's a...

1393
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,580
Alright, here's another...

1394
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,160
Okay, this is the last visualization.

1395
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,620
Thank you, Stock Photos, for putting, like, dog...

1396
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,240
Chihuahuas next to other dog breeds.

1397
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,940
I really appreciate it for the visualization.

1398
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,020
I...

1399
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,780
Who started it?

1400
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:21,200
Who was the one that talked about spider monkeys and, like, how does it work?

1401
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,440
That's on them.

1402
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,380
Thank that, Dragoon.

1403
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,380
Uh, Frank...

1404
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:28,700
We...

1405
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,540
Okay, here we go.

1406
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,620
No, I didn't start it!

1407
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,640
I didn't start it!

1408
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,260
You guys questioned it!

1409
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,900
You guys fucking questioned it!

1410
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,740
So this is, like, a Chihuahua next to a Rottweiler.

1411
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,580
So, like, don't ever say, like, how does a spider and a monkey...

1412
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,920
Get it going.

1413
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,300
When we have Rottweiler-Chihuahua mixes.

1414
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,060
In the world.

1415
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,680
Uh...

1416
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,740
I can't believe we got calendar.

1417
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:02,740
Alright.

1418
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,780
Let's see.

1419
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,740
Let's see, where do I go?

1420
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,240
There's so many places I could go.

1421
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,060
But which way is the right way?

1422
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,080
I'll just go to the right side.

1423
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:20,720
It was finally how people started calling out random...

1424
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,460
Random Dragoons.

1425
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,720
Like, it was you, wasn't it?

1426
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,340
Alright, let's get this guy out of here.

1427
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:29,880
Oh, shit.

1428
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,740
He's so fast.

1429
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,760
He's so...

1430
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,100
It's alright.

1431
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,180
It's alright.

1432
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,440
Spider-Mama can just give birth to another.

1433
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,340
Glory to Spider-Mama.

1434
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,880
Oh yeah, I should actually upgrade.

1435
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,160
I keep forgetting to upgrade stuff, dude.

1436
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,360
Alright, let's get all this spellbinding shit.

1437
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,920
Might as well.

1438
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,240
Alright.

1439
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,840
I don't need other...

1440
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,520
I don't...

1441
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,660
I don't need anything else.

1442
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,180
Okay.

1443
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,680
Father, thank you for the super chat.

1444
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,420
Thank you, thank you.

1445
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,940
What do you call a Bulldog and a Shih Tzu mix?

1446
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,560
I don't know.

1447
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,060
What do you call that?

1448
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,660
Is this a joke or are you actually curious?

1449
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,360
I can't tell.

1450
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,280
I don't know if you're using me as a form of Google.

1451
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,880
Or like if you...

1452
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,940
It's a joke.

1453
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,660
Thank you for the super chat.

1454
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,080
Thank you.

1455
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,680
Thank you.

1456
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:26,500
Father.

1457
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,300
Oh, bullshit!

1458
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,340
Nice.

1459
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:29,680
That was...

1460
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,140
Actually...

1461
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,220
I'm sorry.

1462
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:31,860
What's the joke?

1463
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,200
So you can super chat me the joke.

1464
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,540
I'm joking.

1465
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,340
I'm joking.

1466
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,320
Guys, I'm...

1467
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,560
I'm joking.

1468
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,240
Oh my God.

1469
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:41,880
What is it?

1470
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,020
The only way I know is if you super chat me the answer.

1471
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,800
Finally.

1472
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,140
No, no.

1473
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,460
I...

1474
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:49,860
What?

1475
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,560
What is it?

1476
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,540
What kind of mix would it be?

1477
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:54,800
Okay.

1478
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,320
Oh, what?

1479
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,100
I got a spine?

1480
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,840
Which spine is this?

1481
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,700
Oh, shit.

1482
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,620
Wait, you're still alive?

1483
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,800
Oh, shit.

1484
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,440
Oh, oh.

1485
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,120
Oh, no.

1486
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:07,900
No.

1487
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,020
It's all right.

1488
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:09,520
We're fine.

1489
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,060
Fine.

1490
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:19,020
Guys, if you know the answer, make sure to super chat it so I can see it.

1491
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,220
For legal reasons, that's a joke.

1492
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:22,520
Okay.

1493
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,420
Okay.

1494
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,440
In before Doki Birds gets canceled for she begs for...

1495
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,040
She baits her viewers for money.

1496
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,220
Okay.

1497
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:36,840
All right.

1498
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,180
She's not joking.

1499
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,560
All right.

1500
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,320
Nice.

1501
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:51,360
Drop the answer in the comment below, but she'll only be able to read it if...

1502
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,400
It's like...

1503
00:56:54,360 --> 00:57:02,220
Oh man, it's so unfortunate that like I'm color... I'm colorblind and I could only read messages that are in red.

1504
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,220
It's so unfortunate.

1505
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,840
I have a special type of colorblindness.

1506
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:19,440
I can't read any text that's not behind a red background.

1507
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,800
I see.

1508
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:22,820
That's crazy.

1509
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,660
It's so unfortunate.

1510
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,880
I know it's a curse.

1511
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,640
I was born with...

1512
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,800
With this sickness.

1513
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:45,260
I'm just raising awareness, you know, I'm just here raising awareness.

1514
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,100
It's so painful to live with it every day of my life.

1515
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,880
I was born with so many debuffs.

1516
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,740
It's just very unlucky.

1517
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,480
All right, nice.

1518
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:08,280
Easy.

1519
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,880
Oh, but not easy.

1520
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,100
Oh my god, wait, Burrito said something?

1521
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,400
What?

1522
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:17,840
Did you...

1523
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,620
Wait, what did he say?

1524
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,980
I gotta get rid of him.

1525
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:35,460
Jeez, this... this area is like so annoying though, because they like swarmed you so... they like swarmed you so much.

1526
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,540
Did I go the right way?

1527
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,420
I feel like this is like a maze.

1528
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,560
There's so many like tunnels and everything.

1529
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,900
Do I go down?

1530
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:47,900
Oh, I do.

1531
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,080
Okay, I only have like one heal left.

1532
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:57,350
Let's see.

1533
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:01,570
Where else do I go?

1534
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:02,730
I guess down?

1535
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:06,410
Oh, nice.

1536
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:07,810
There's an... oh no, not nice.

1537
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:12,110
Okay, let me heal this and then get the spellbinder real fast.

1538
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,510
Look, I can see the spellbinder because it's right...

1539
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:19,630
Oh my god, guys!

1540
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,170
I can see the spellbinder!

1541
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,850
I can actually see my staff now!

1542
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:28,090
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but it was so hard to see my staff.

1543
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:34,690
But now that it's red, I can finally see what I'm... what I'm holding onto.

1544
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,650
God, I'm so lucky.

1545
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:40,010
I'm dead.

1546
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,030
There's no way.

1547
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,050
I'm so fucking dead.

1548
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,470
I am so dead.

1549
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:44,950
No!

1550
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:45,970
Oh!

1551
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,810
Paint used to be blue!

1552
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:51,650
Unbelievable.

1553
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:54,450
Anyway, Burrito, thank you for the super chat.

1554
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:55,310
Thank you, thank you.

1555
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:59,550
Oh, it's because one is a bulldog and the other is a Shih Tzu.

1556
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:02,250
So the cross would clearly be a zoo dog.

1557
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:02,910
Oh yeah!

1558
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:03,710
You're right!

1559
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:04,590
It's a zoo dog!

1560
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,270
Oh, that's so funny.

1561
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,450
Thank you for the super chat.

1562
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,470
Thank you, thank you.

1563
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,550
Alright, this way.

1564
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:17,270
This way.

1565
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,030
I'm just gonna run past all of these.

1566
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,630
These monsters are so annoying to fight.

1567
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:24,590
Like, I cannot be bothered.

1568
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,330
She's throwing for...

1569
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:32,110
God, Doki, what happened to you?

1570
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:32,730
You've changed.

1571
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,090
Why are you throwing for money and engagement?

1572
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:43,770
You could have easily killed these guys, Doki.

1573
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,630
Now you're dying to mobs?

1574
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,570
What the fuck happened to you?

1575
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,690
Guys, it's because they're not red.

1576
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:56,590
Like, I told you guys, I can't see anything that's not red anymore.

1577
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:00,530
Nice.

1578
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:01,410
Alright.

1579
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,110
Oh, wait, you followed me?

1580
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,170
Oh, shit!

1581
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:08,390
It's awkward.

1582
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:14,470
Because that one guy told me that if I suck more, more people...

1583
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,530
If I die...

1584
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,950
If I die more, I'll get more viewers.

1585
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:20,350
Apparently.

1586
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:28,350
Alright, here we go.

1587
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:31,990
Wait, where the fuck am I?

1588
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:33,810
This is, like, new area.

1589
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,350
Oh, I feel like I should not have gone this way.

1590
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,870
This way feels, like, more dangerous.

1591
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,410
Yeah, I went the danger area.

1592
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,870
The one I went before seems a lot safer.

1593
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,830
Yeah, it definitely feels a lot safer.

1594
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:48,690
Yeah, now there's a scorpion guy, too.

1595
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:49,730
Like, I...

1596
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:53,670
Oh, yeah, this area does not feel safe.

1597
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,090
I do not feel safe at all.

1598
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,750
Oh, there's so many things here.

1599
01:01:58,790 --> 01:01:58,950
Oh!

1600
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,290
There are so many things here.

1601
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,250
Oh, and I missed.

1602
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,390
What happened to Pigsy?

1603
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,310
I don't even know what happened to him.

1604
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:12,590
Like, am I...

1605
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:15,030
I definitely went the more dangerous.

1606
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,970
I wonder if, like, these guys...

1607
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:20,570
Okay.

1608
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:23,550
I'm just gonna get rid of them first.

1609
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:24,470
Oh, fuck, okay.

1610
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,030
I'm just gonna get rid of these guys first.

1611
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:28,710
What the fuck?

1612
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:29,490
How did I get here?

1613
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,090
Oh, it's cause my...

1614
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:32,630
What the fuck?

1615
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:33,050
Okay!

1616
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,470
Okay, this is actual bullshit.

1617
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:37,850
This is actually bullshit.

1618
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:38,910
Wait, where am I?

1619
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,270
Where am I?

1620
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,210
Like...

1621
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:43,710
This...

1622
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:45,210
How is it...

1623
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:47,650
How is there more of a maze?

1624
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,530
I already went through all the maze area!

1625
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:53,910
I already went through all the maze area!

1626
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:54,310
Oh no.

1627
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:57,590
Oh my god...

1628
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:00,030
Oh my god, this is so frustrating.

1629
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:00,870
Oh my god, this is so frustrating.

1630
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,630
This is actually so frustrating.

1631
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,620
Okay, let's just meditate.

1632
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,580
And clear our heads.

1633
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,820
You know, to be fair...

1634
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,520
With all these debuffs...

1635
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,380
I'm a pretty good gamer being able to see through...

1636
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:23,020
Only being able to see through the color red.

1637
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,400
I'm practically playing by sound alone.

1638
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,420
Okay, at least we have the meditation center.

1639
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,940
To cool things down.

1640
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,340
Yeah, I use echolocation to figure out where to go.

1641
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,300
Oh, thank god there is an incense here.

1642
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:57,650
Go, go!

1643
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,830
Where do I go next?

1644
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:09,830
Alright, nice.

1645
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,430
Oh yeah, you're right.

1646
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:14,470
Sorry, I just screeched for no reason.

1647
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,930
I actually use my laugh to echolocate.

1648
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:18,530
That's why I laugh all the time.

1649
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:24,090
I know everything makes so much more sense now.

1650
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:27,590
Oh wait, do they not come out?

1651
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:28,970
Are they just there?

1652
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:31,790
Oh, ew!

1653
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,070
What the fuck?

1654
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,370
Oh, that's gross.

1655
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,750
That's actually gross.

1656
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,130
Laughing is actually my echolocation.

1657
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:45,210
Oh lord, drop.

1658
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:46,890
Alright, I'm trying...

1659
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:47,570
Alright, where am I?

1660
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:51,990
Alright, I gotta figure out...

1661
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,950
Where do I go next?

1662
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,510
Okay, so I have to go this way.

1663
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,310
Alright, now I have to go left.

1664
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,010
Alright.

1665
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:01,890
Okay.

1666
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,530
What the fuck is that?

1667
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,810
Oh, it's just a cocoon.

1668
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,050
Like, is anything gonna happen?

1669
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:14,910
Nothing?

1670
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,390
Does anybody live here?

1671
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,770
Why is this a boss?

1672
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:20,090
Oh.

1673
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:21,990
Oh.

1674
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,450
I don't think he liked that.

1675
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:26,610
Ugh!

1676
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:27,770
Ugh!

1677
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:27,990
Ugh!

1678
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:42,800
Wait.

1679
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,180
I can't see where you are.

1680
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,300
Okay, there you are.

1681
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,880
I'm trying to figure out where he is.

1682
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,840
I'm echolocating right now, guys.

1683
01:05:58,740 --> 01:05:59,600
Just so you guys know.

1684
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,000
You know, I'm trying to echolocate.

1685
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,080
Okay, he's right over here.

1686
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,980
It's working!

1687
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,780
It's working guys!

1688
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,220
I figured out where he is!

1689
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:19,580
Laughing daredevil.

1690
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,820
Oh my god, I told you guys!

1691
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:26,500
Coincidence?

1692
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,780
That's why I laugh so much!

1693
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:32,740
Whoa!

1694
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,280
Sorry, I forgot to laugh, so that's how he got me.

1695
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,380
Every time he hits me.

1696
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,120
Guys!

1697
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,920
Every time he hits me, I forgot to laugh!

1698
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:50,900
Wait, what?

1699
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,240
How did you lose so much HP?

1700
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,940
Oh, it's because he's just a baby!

1701
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,460
I literally beat up a baby there.

1702
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:04,760
He just got born.

1703
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,600
It actually worked!

1704
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,780
Doki, you were supposed to lose to him!

1705
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,640
Now you're not going to get the viewership!

1706
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,160
Laughing daredevil.

1707
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,060
I don't even know if I was going the right area.

1708
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,840
Like, I'm so fucking lost.

1709
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,280
Return.

1710
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,480
I think he has to be like a bonus boss, because there should be a bonus boss.

1711
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,680
There's nowhere else to go here.

1712
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,300
Yeah, you know, I forced him to be given birth.

1713
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,780
He would have been stuck in the womb his entire life.

1714
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,480
If it wasn't for me.

1715
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,740
Like, was he optional?

1716
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,200
I don't like this area.

1717
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,580
I really don't like this area.

1718
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,440
Holy fuck.

1719
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,720
Laughing.

1720
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:53,640
Alright.

1721
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,480
Laughing.

1722
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,860
Hey, I didn't lose to a baby!

1723
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,440
I didn't lose to a baby!

1724
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,660
He's for the secret area?

1725
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:04,440
Alright.

1726
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,700
Did I unlock it?

1727
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,460
Did I do it?

1728
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,700
I don't even know.

1729
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,460
Did I just somehow stumble into a secret area?

1730
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,480
Like, what the fuck?

1731
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,840
I'm so lost.

1732
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:17,820
Laughing.

1733
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:20,980
I'm so fucking lost.

1734
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:21,640
Laughing.

1735
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,280
I just somehow stumbled into the secret area.

1736
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,340
Oh, this is an XP.

1737
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,740
Oh, I might as well kill these.

1738
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:28,820
For XP.

1739
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,820
Like, they're here anyway.

1740
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:36,250
Laughing.

1741
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,770
I need the money.

1742
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:41,650
Alright.

1743
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:43,490
Laughing.

1744
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:45,250
Woo!

1745
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,250
How much does it give?

1746
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,350
I mean, 105 ain't too bad.

1747
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:54,850
Laughing.

1748
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:54,970
Woo!

1749
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:58,230
It's convenient that I can just...

1750
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:58,670
You know.

1751
01:08:58,970 --> 01:08:59,990
I don't have to be close.

1752
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,410
I just can farm these.

1753
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,430
Guys, we need the money, guys.

1754
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:06,370
We need like 40k apparently.

1755
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,670
Laughing.

1756
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,470
We're broke right now.

1757
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:10,750
We gotta tap those stacks.

1758
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:12,210
Laughing.

1759
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:14,350
Woo!

1760
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,310
Okay, another tap.

1761
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,010
Oh, and he gave me gold too!

1762
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,130
Laughing.

1763
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:22,230
Nice.

1764
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:23,990
Tap.

1765
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,610
I feel like I don't really need XP that much.

1766
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:30,270
I feel like if I overlevel it's not gonna be...

1767
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,390
Like...

1768
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:32,770
I'm gonna lose even more viewers.

1769
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:33,590
Laughing.

1770
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:36,470
Because of how good I am!

1771
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:37,630
Laughing.

1772
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:39,690
Laughing.

1773
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:41,090
Laughing.

1774
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:45,810
Guys, if I overlevel...

1775
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,430
I'm gonna lose my viewership.

1776
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:48,170
Laughing.

1777
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:49,910
Tap that.

1778
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:51,210
Tap that.

1779
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,230
Jesus Christ, it's just everywhere.

1780
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:57,130
Too strong unsubscribe.

1781
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:58,430
Laughing.

1782
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:02,990
I'm not here to watch VTubers be competent at video games.

1783
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,290
Laughing.

1784
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:08,030
You gotta start throwing to be safe.

1785
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:08,990
You're right.

1786
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:10,490
You're so right, guys.

1787
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:11,390
Laughing.

1788
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:14,150
Oh wait, what the fuck?

1789
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,210
Do they just not move?

1790
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:17,370
Oh, they're just...

1791
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:18,570
Oh, wait.

1792
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,310
I don't even have to tap them.

1793
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,410
They literally are just there to get farmed.

1794
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:23,910
Laughing.

1795
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:25,110
Hey.

1796
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:28,830
They're literally... look.

1797
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:32,210
They're literally just there to get farmed.

1798
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:33,330
They haven't been like...

1799
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:34,790
fully developed yet.

1800
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:35,950
Good.

1801
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:36,850
Laughing.

1802
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:38,890
Laughing.

1803
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:39,750
So I'll feel less bad.

1804
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:40,670
Laughing.

1805
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:43,470
Hey.

1806
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:46,310
Let's see.

1807
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:48,850
Where do I go?

1808
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:50,090
Oh...

1809
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:52,010
I guess I go down?

1810
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,400
Okay, no I do not go down.

1811
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,060
Hey, what?

1812
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,080
Then where do I go?

1813
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,080
I feel like I've been everywhere.

1814
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:03,520
Wait.

1815
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:04,660
Can I meditate again?

1816
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:06,220
Wait.

1817
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,440
I can meditate again?

1818
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:13,400
What?

1819
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:14,520
What?

1820
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,600
Can I get the...

1821
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,080
level?

1822
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:17,660
Oh, no?

1823
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,080
Oh, I don't get anything?

1824
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,120
Oh, I don't get anything?

1825
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:23,740
What's the point of meditating?

1826
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:24,540
Laughing.

1827
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:28,100
That's so Buddha of you, Dokie.

1828
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,580
What's the point of meditating if I don't get anything in return?

1829
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:32,300
Laughing.

1830
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:32,340
What's the point of meditating if I don't get anything in return?

1831
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,500
Who needs inner peace?

1832
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,120
Inner peace doesn't give me money.

1833
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,800
I don't need no inner peace.

1834
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,520
I'm very sad of you.

1835
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,180
What's inner peace?

1836
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,640
Can I monetize that?

1837
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,400
Do I get stronger?

1838
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,680
Naturally true.

1839
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,040
Alright, let's see.

1840
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,300
Where the fuck do I go from here?

1841
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,060
It raises my inner monkey.

1842
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,200
Oh, there's a stair here.

1843
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,840
Okay, there's staircases here.

1844
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,640
There's a platform, which is good.

1845
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,700
Inner peace don't pay no bill.

1846
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,820
We're not bad people, I swear.

1847
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,160
Okay.

1848
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,680
I guess we go here.

1849
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,280
Whoa!

1850
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,900
What are you doing here?

1851
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,640
Get out of here.

1852
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:44,400
You don't belong.

1853
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,220
You're not a spider.

1854
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,380
Spiders only.

1855
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,540
This is for spiders and monkeys.

1856
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,220
And also pigs.

1857
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,120
And also beetles.

1858
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:56,160
But anything that flies...

1859
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,500
Anything that flies is a no-go.

1860
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:03,340
I guess we go this way.

1861
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,680
And centipedes.

1862
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,440
But not you.

1863
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,460
You have wings.

1864
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:12,740
You're bad.

1865
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:13,920
And scorpions too.

1866
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,000
Yeah, and scorpions.

1867
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,720
This is a no-fly zone, exactly.

1868
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:18,780
You get it.

1869
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,200
Nobody is allowed to fly.

1870
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,340
Did I come from here?

1871
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,180
Yeah, this is a scorpion.

1872
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,640
Wait, then where do I go from here?

1873
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,280
Here?

1874
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,440
Oh, okay, there you go.

1875
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:30,920
There's a platform.

1876
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,550
I might as well grab this.

1877
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:39,930
And then another platform.

1878
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:41,810
Now where am I?

1879
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:45,610
And then I guess this way?

1880
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,170
Is this platform?

1881
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:50,730
Oh, there he is!

1882
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:51,710
There's the beetle.

1883
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:53,450
Alright, I'm ready.

1884
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:56,050
I'm fucking ready this time.

1885
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,210
Wait, where's the fly with the bow?

1886
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,210
Okay, we gotta get rid of him first though.

1887
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:01,690
This guy is a problem.

1888
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:03,690
Alright, nice.

1889
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:04,650
Alright, now we're fine.

1890
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,380
Wait, you have wings.

1891
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,120
That's not allowed.

1892
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,920
This is a no-fly zone?

1893
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:14,420
Sir?

1894
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,300
Sir, this is a no-fly zone.

1895
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,200
I don't make the rules.

1896
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,680
You're not allowed to fly here.

1897
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,280
Oh, shit.

1898
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:23,240
Okay, we both hit each other.

1899
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:23,540
That's good.

1900
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,080
Alright.

1901
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:28,480
Nice.

1902
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,900
We finally got this area.

1903
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,300
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1904
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:33,680
Thank you.

1905
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:34,280
Thank you.

1906
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,280
Lord question, can Doki fly or just Kroki?

1907
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,440
Like, can you just levitate?

1908
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,520
Can you just levitate at some time?

1909
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,300
That's a good question.

1910
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:53,590
Alright, where should I go after this?

1911
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:56,110
I guess I go this way.

1912
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:57,850
I never know where to go.

1913
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:01,150
I never know where to go.

1914
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:03,270
Come on.

1915
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:03,730
Whoa!

1916
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:06,990
Okay, nice.

1917
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:07,590
I dodged it.

1918
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:12,450
Wait, I can kill these egg sacs for extra money?

1919
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:13,850
Wait, nice.

1920
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:15,630
I didn't know that.

1921
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:17,510
Oh, they're like jars.

1922
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:23,070
Kroki is like my private jet.

1923
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:26,810
Time to go to the grocery store.

1924
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:29,210
Let me grab this private jet real quick.

1925
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:32,130
Okay.

1926
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:33,850
Get these rocks out.

1927
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35,610
Get these spider rocks.

1928
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:36,850
Coke!

1929
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:43,770
Oh, the rice cocoons are for a quest.

1930
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:44,690
Do not sell them.

1931
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:47,250
Oh, the ones I'm holding onto?

1932
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,310
Whoa!

1933
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,990
I was just curious about this mushroom.

1934
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:55,070
This funky mushroom.

1935
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:57,450
Alright, nice.

1936
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,310
Gather time.

1937
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:02,190
Esa, welcome to the tomato farm!

1938
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,970
Welcome, welcome!

1939
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:03,510
Welcome!

1940
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:04,910
I love it.

1941
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:05,970
I'll level up later.

1942
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:07,510
I need to get rid of this guy.

1943
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:08,770
He's in the no-fly zone.

1944
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:10,870
Get out of here.

1945
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,310
This is the no-fly zone.

1946
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,750
Okay, let me heal too, just in case.

1947
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,950
Now where am I?

1948
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:19,550
Everything looks the same.

1949
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:25,150
It's just rocks.

1950
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:27,770
Where am I?

1951
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:30,530
Will I ever know where I am?

1952
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:35,130
Find out next time on the next episode of Dokian Bug Country.

1953
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,250
Just rocks and webs.

1954
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,050
Okay, nice.

1955
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:44,230
I should be able to kill him without him being able to do anything.

1956
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:46,150
Do I get to hit these?

1957
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:46,590
Oh, hey!

1958
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:47,550
This is a secret area!

1959
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:49,690
I fucking knew it.

1960
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:50,810
Alright.

1961
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:51,790
Coke!

1962
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:53,730
Nice.

1963
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:54,890
Oh, combo!

1964
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:55,930
A Collat!

1965
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:57,530
It's got Collat!

1966
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,950
Nice.

1967
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:00,750
Nice Collat.

1968
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:02,970
Oh shit.

1969
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,830
Wait, that's a bigger one.

1970
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:05,870
Wait, that's a huge one.

1971
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:11,410
No country for old bugs.

1972
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,990
Alright.

1973
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:14,490
Nice another Collat.

1974
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:15,350
This should be the last one.

1975
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:17,990
Wombo combo!

1976
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:23,450
You get like five, like a hundred each, which is pretty nice.

1977
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:25,850
For like something that doesn't move.

1978
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,130
Is it this?

1979
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,290
Are you the bad one?

1980
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:29,570
No.

1981
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:30,210
Okay.

1982
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:32,430
What the fuck is that?

1983
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,250
The fuck?

1984
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:35,030
Can it even move?

1985
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:37,230
Oh, it can't even move.

1986
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:39,550
Oh shit.

1987
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:40,750
Oh, what?

1988
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:43,970
How strong are you?

1989
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,530
Holy shit!

1990
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:46,970
Okay.

1991
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:48,170
Alright.

1992
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:50,170
Alright.

1993
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,290
Okay.

1994
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,090
Oh, okay.

1995
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:53,670
Are you blue?

1996
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:54,690
Oh, he's blue!

1997
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,550
Oh, that makes more sense.

1998
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:57,530
You're blue.

1999
01:17:58,830 --> 01:17:59,510
Alright, nice.

2000
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:00,610
Now let me absorb you.

2001
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:02,590
Alright.

2002
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:04,190
Another item I'll never use.

2003
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,020
I was like, how the fuck did he take 80% of my HP?

2004
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,160
I was able to squish all of them.

2005
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,520
These guys don't...

2006
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:19,700
Oh.

2007
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,820
Oh, he's just a little worm.

2008
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:24,180
Bye.

2009
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:29,470
Did I do something bad?

2010
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:31,110
Oh, he's not a little worm!

2011
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:31,750
No more!

2012
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:33,670
Is he gonna slam?

2013
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:34,490
What's he gonna do?

2014
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:35,570
He's just a little worm.

2015
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:38,270
Guys, he's...

2016
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:39,670
he's not so little anymore.

2017
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,510
Yes.

2018
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:44,650
Nevermind.

2019
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,950
He's not just a little worm.

2020
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:49,670
Oh!

2021
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:51,330
Here you go.

2022
01:18:56,410 --> 01:18:57,530
I hate these.

2023
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:58,330
I hate...

2024
01:18:58,330 --> 01:18:59,610
I hate all the Guai's in this.

2025
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:09,510
I don't like any of the guise in this chapter.

2026
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:11,150
It's so gross.

2027
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,280
I hate bugs so much.

2028
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,140
Wait, is that it?

2029
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:20,760
Is that it?

2030
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,940
Is there nothing else?

2031
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,360
Yeah, this whole area is pretty gross.

2032
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,060
Is there anything I should be getting from here or what?

2033
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,280
There should be a room with treasures.

2034
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,920
Go back to the shrine behind.

2035
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,620
Guys, where's the shrine?

2036
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,580
I don't even know where I came from.

2037
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,140
Where did I come from?

2038
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:51,800
Where's the shrine?

2039
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,000
I'll get rid of this.

2040
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:01,780
Yeah, but I used the teleporter to fight all of them again.

2041
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,220
We don't like that.

2042
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,780
We don't want to fight them.

2043
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,180
Can I go up this way?

2044
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,860
Guys, I can't go up this way, okay?

2045
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:14,480
Fine, I'll use the teleporter.

2046
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,900
Instant transmission.

2047
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:24,940
Alright.

2048
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,460
There's apparently a treasure behind this shrine.

2049
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:29,940
This way?

2050
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,620
What is considered behind?

2051
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,240
Guys, is it this way?

2052
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:38,700
Where did I come from?

2053
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:42,260
It's here?

2054
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,120
No, it's to the left?

2055
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,060
This is the left.

2056
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,560
My left?

2057
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,100
This is where I came from.

2058
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,640
Did I jump down from here?

2059
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,180
The opposite from the front?

2060
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,500
To your west.

2061
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,240
Oh, west!

2062
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:58,960
That's this way!

2063
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,100
My other left?

2064
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,400
Oh, it's this way!

2065
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:10,920
Guys, I...

2066
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,320
I don't know which left it is.

2067
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:16,000
Over green bridge and then left.

2068
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,520
Oh, oh it's this way.

2069
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:18,940
So I was right.

2070
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,220
Okay, this way.

2071
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:22,860
Right?

2072
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,440
Is this where treasure is at?

2073
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,240
Who's fighting?

2074
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,660
What does that mean?

2075
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:37,820
What does that mean?

2076
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,080
I'll always be last.

2077
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:40,640
Please!

2078
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,480
Stop!

2079
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,660
Okay, give me a sec!

2080
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:47,740
The voices!

2081
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,480
Oh, it's the lanterns!

2082
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:55,340
Oh, thank god.

2083
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,120
Oh, thank god.

2084
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:58,860
Even Wukong was like, shut the fuck up.

2085
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:02,760
He's like, I can't take it anymore.

2086
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,700
I can't take it.

2087
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,220
Wukong應quxui son.

2088
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:11,980
And he was like, STOP!

2089
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,300
STOP THE VOICES!!!

2090
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:19,060
He couldn't handle it either.

2091
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,140
Alright, absorb.

2092
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,680
Of course, there's so many hot ladies!

2093
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,600
They all came from a very hot mom!

2094
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:33,800
Hot mom spider!

2095
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,180
Okay.

2096
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:36,020
Okay.

2097
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,420
Right?

2098
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:39,980
Okay.

2099
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:40,060
Okay.

2100
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,980
Spotters can give birth to a lot of hot ladies.

2101
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,440
Hot spotter ladies.

2102
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,140
Alright, here we go.

2103
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:49,600
Oh, there's treasure.

2104
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,840
This is totally a trap.

2105
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,480
Wow, there's so many treasures here.

2106
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,420
I wonder what's gonna happen when I open all of them up.

2107
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:06,720
Wow, all these treasures lying there.

2108
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:10,780
All defenseless and vulnerable.

2109
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:15,460
It would be a shame if a monkey comes over and just takes them.

2110
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,660
Wait, nothing happened?

2111
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:22,300
Nothing happened?

2112
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,880
Oh my gosh, she likes me.

2113
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,620
Wait a minute, guys.

2114
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:31,920
Guys, I think she likes me.

2115
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:34,280
What's that?

2116
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:37,000
She's just chilling there.

2117
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:39,360
Oh my god.

2118
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:41,440
Nothing happened?

2119
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,340
I'm not...

2120
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,760
I don't know what I expected.

2121
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,340
I don't know what I expected.

2122
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,520
I was like, ooh.

2123
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:57,240
This big worm baby thing.

2124
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,060
Sure looks so...

2125
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:00,840
Sure looks innocent.

2126
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,920
And it's gonna be...

2127
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:04,780
helping me.

2128
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,440
He doesn't look dangerous at all.

2129
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:10,140
Damn.

2130
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:13,620
I wonder what this worm thing is doing here.

2131
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,280
Oh my god, he has a face.

2132
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,260
What the fuck?

2133
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,180
I like how he...

2134
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:22,740
Oh, shit.

2135
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,240
Oh, fuck.

2136
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:24,580
Okay.

2137
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:25,420
Give me a sec.

2138
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,620
He has to get closer, right?

2139
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,140
Oh, I'm getting policed.

2140
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:31,540
Never mind.

2141
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,320
Hahaha.

2142
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,640
If you don't do that.

2143
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:36,440
Oh!

2144
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,820
Okay, that's gross.

2145
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:39,660
That is very gross.

2146
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,400
Sir, please.

2147
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,260
Please wear a diaper, sir.

2148
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,500
Juices should not be flowing all willy-nilly.

2149
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,000
Oh, nice.

2150
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,140
I got the proto-armor worm.

2151
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,740
I don't know why I just jumped in there.

2152
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,560
Like, haha.

2153
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,340
It's like...

2154
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,500
My gosh.

2155
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,500
Golly gee williker.

2156
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,200
That worm sure do look awfully friendly.

2157
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,460
Just lying there.

2158
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:02,860
Alright, nice.

2159
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:03,740
Is that it?

2160
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:09,060
Go back to the shrine and talk to the dragon guy?

2161
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,160
There's a dragon guy?

2162
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:11,660
Which...

2163
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,200
There's a dragon...

2164
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:15,880
Alright.

2165
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:17,440
Let me heal.

2166
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,100
Too fast again.

2167
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,280
Doki, we're missing all the new viewers.

2168
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,140
How are you first trying all the bosses, Doki?

2169
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,780
Oh, the grandpa?

2170
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,080
Oh, it's your instant transmission then.

2171
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:37,370
I'm gonna go to the art world.

2172
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,200
Tythus, thank you for the super chat.

2173
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:47,940
Thank you, thank you.

2174
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,500
Doki, would you still love us if we were a worm?

2175
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,140
I told you guys about that funny...

2176
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,880
This is a really funny tweet I saw.

2177
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:05,200
It was basically like this girl tweeted about like how she broke up with her ex-boyfriend.

2178
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:08,920
Because she said like, oh, would you love me if I was still a worm?

2179
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:14,420
And then he was like, no, but I'll get you a really nice terranium.

2180
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:19,580
So like, you can like live your life in there really happy and spoiled.

2181
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,040
And you can see who I'm dating next.

2182
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,800
And then I was like...

2183
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:37,280
And then they got into a really big argument and she broke up with him.

2184
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:41,990
Haha!

2185
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:46,110
Alright.

2186
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:49,550
Oh, I'm here to deliver the worm.

2187
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,920
I'll cook my habit.

2188
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,440
I thought he was friend and then he tried to spit on me.

2189
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,740
Oooh, he's gonna study.

2190
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,080
Alright, we're gonna look at the dragon.

2191
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:09,900
I need to use the bathroom.

2192
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:10,700
I'll be right back.

2193
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:25,350
I'm back.

2194
01:30:25,610 --> 01:30:26,370
What did I miss?

2195
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:26,930
Nothing?

2196
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:27,670
Okay, that's good.

2197
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:30,090
Thank you for the super chat!

2198
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:30,470
Thank you!

2199
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:33,950
Alright, let's grab all these materials.

2200
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,010
I'll harvest everything.

2201
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:38,910
I'm not gonna use it, but I'll harvest all of it.

2202
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:41,770
Alright.

2203
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:47,430
Alright, let's grab some...

2204
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:47,790
Oh, wait.

2205
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:48,550
Oh, you have upgrade?

2206
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:50,890
Do you have any upgrades?

2207
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:52,550
I do!

2208
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:53,990
Okay, nice.

2209
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:55,590
Upgrade!

2210
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:57,210
I love upgrades.

2211
01:30:59,370 --> 01:30:59,870
Uh...

2212
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:01,170
Oh, do I have new soaks?

2213
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,530
Uses the gourd...

2214
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:08,350
Increases health recovery from using the gourd when at critical health.

2215
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:09,490
Wait, what do I have?

2216
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:10,970
I have...

2217
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:11,610
Oh, okay.

2218
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:12,170
I don't need that.

2219
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:14,590
Okay, I can just use...

2220
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:15,470
I'll just use that.

2221
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:17,970
I'm not using Cloud Strike anymore, anyway.

2222
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:19,370
Scatter!

2223
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:23,610
Near the harvest area?

2224
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:25,010
Give you rest?

2225
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:25,810
Okay.

2226
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:27,550
That's fast.

2227
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,530
Alright, rest time.

2228
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,360
Alright.

2229
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,380
Worm, worm, worm!

2230
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:41,280
Do you have something for me, old dragon?

2231
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:45,540
No, I don't.

2232
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:46,240
You fucking lies.

2233
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,020
Worms... Worms don't...

2234
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:52,500
Wait, how do worms reproduce?

2235
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,840
How do worms reproduce?

2236
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,640
Do they do it the same way?

2237
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,600
The male cell in each worm then fertilize the female cells on...

2238
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:05,040
Oh, okay.

2239
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:09,000
Two mature worms lie next to each other, head to tail.

2240
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:09,740
Oh!

2241
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,140
Oh, that's interesting.

2242
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,360
Oh, that's how they do it?

2243
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:14,400
What the fuck?

2244
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:24,040
Guys, science lesson with Doki.

2245
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:25,940
Do you guys wanna know how worms...

2246
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,120
I wanna know how...

2247
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,540
Do worms lay eggs?

2248
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,600
Wait, are there worm eggs?

2249
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:35,680
How...

2250
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:39,460
How do worms make lay...

2251
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:41,560
Lay eggs?

2252
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,580
Have you guys never been curious?

2253
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,780
I'm just curious!

2254
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:54,340
They just always like snakes when they like...

2255
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:56,280
When they like tangle...

2256
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,580
They like wrestle, you know?

2257
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,260
So you see two snakes like wrestling each other.

2258
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:01,200
Oh, they're not wrestling.

2259
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:04,320
They're not wrestling.

2260
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,560
They're not wrestling.

2261
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,580
Quick YouTube pattern now!

2262
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,360
The worms are holding hands, quote on quote.

2263
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,260
It's free education!

2264
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,880
I'm just...

2265
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,620
Oh my God!

2266
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,700
What the fuck is that?

2267
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:24,820
What!

2268
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,980
What the fuck is...

2269
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:30,240
Do you guys wanna see what worms look like with baby worms?

2270
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:30,460
Worms?

2271
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,100
What the fuck?

2272
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,400
What the fuck?

2273
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:39,240
Maybe I should show this on YouTube.

2274
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,040
I'm not gonna show this.

2275
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,060
I'm not gonna show this.

2276
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:43,740
Bro!

2277
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,900
What the fuck are these eggs?

2278
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:47,260
What are these?

2279
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,100
Oh my god!

2280
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:49,760
Okay.

2281
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,340
Today I learned.

2282
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,600
Guys, don't look at worm eggs.

2283
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,320
Don't look at worm eggs.

2284
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:58,220
I'm eating dinner.

2285
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,380
Don't look up worm eggs.

2286
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:01,600
Don't look up worm eggs.

2287
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:04,460
You guys don't wanna know.

2288
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,580
You guys don't wanna know.

2289
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:08,340
Alright.

2290
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,160
Alright.

2291
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,960
Cause I never seen like worms, baby worms before.

2292
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,840
Like hatching and stuff like that.

2293
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:16,000
So I got curious.

2294
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:18,320
Where did that come from?

2295
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:18,860
Here?

2296
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:22,280
When does the worm give birth?

2297
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,060
When does the worm...

2298
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:29,180
When does the worm give birth?

2299
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:31,980
Tвh可以asm.

2300
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:33,460
You coward!

2301
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,480
You coward!

2302
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,120
Sad face.

2303
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:40,100
I mean, if my mod wants to link it...

2304
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:40,920
If my mod wants to link it...

2305
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,480
Okay I know about the echidna thing.

2306
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:46,220
I think that's like everybody knows about it because of the Knuckles comic.

2307
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:49,420
Okay I know about the echidna thing.

2308
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,280
Where I have to go next?

2309
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:56,140
This science fact brought to you This science fact brought to you by bacon and eggs.

2310
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:56,460
By bacon and eggs.

2311
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:06,740
Now that the- now that your stream is demonetized, here is your ad revenue replacement.

2312
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,140
Thank you for the super chat, Papa Sprint.

2313
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,040
Thank you, thank you.

2314
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,460
Alright, nice.

2315
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,060
I mean, not nice.

2316
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:18,880
I don't wanna get demonetized.

2317
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:21,480
Oh, what Knuckles comic?

2318
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,760
You don't wanna know.

2319
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:28,600
It's okay, you don't wanna know, guys.

2320
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:37,860
You don't- if you guys don't know about the Knuckles comic, then, like, that good- Your life on the internet was maybe a lot better than mine.

2321
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,780
You had a more wholesome- wholesome history with the internet.

2322
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,100
What's that green thing?

2323
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,880
What fucking debuff do I have?

2324
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,400
Is that poison?

2325
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:56,440
Oh, I guess that's poison.

2326
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:59,100
They're too pure for this.

2327
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:03,260
Guys, I- You guys have to remember, I grew up on Newgrounds.

2328
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,960
A lot of things came from Newgrounds.

2329
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,780
Newgrounds basically shaped my childhood.

2330
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:17,660
I guess I wanna get more of this, then.

2331
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,160
I'll get the basic upgrades.

2332
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,920
Cannot awaken, it's because of this?

2333
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,520
Reduce the stamina of jump.

2334
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:26,660
Grants a considerable amount of damage reduction.

2335
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:27,520
Oh, okay.

2336
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:28,400
Get that.

2337
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:29,980
And then...

2338
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:32,460
Oh, it explodes?

2339
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:34,340
It goes bang?

2340
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:42,360
Guys, I did not play the meat and fuck games.

2341
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:49,320
I- I was not on that side of Newgrounds.

2342
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,080
I just need you guys to know.

2343
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:58,180
I was- I say I'm a Newgrounds- I- I would admit I was not that type of Newgrounds kid.

2344
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:00,600
I- There's two Newgrounds kid.

2345
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:04,340
Is that and then- And then the edgy ones.

2346
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,380
Of course I know about them.

2347
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:10,880
Everybody on Newgrounds know about them.

2348
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,080
It was there.

2349
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:17,600
Of course I know about them.

2350
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:19,800
I lied about my age on the internet.

2351
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:27,200
So I would see it on the trending pages.

2352
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,480
All right.

2353
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,700
Nice Wait, what the fuck?

2354
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,240
Where did these guys come from?

2355
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:37,480
Yeah.

2356
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,180
Thank you.

2357
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,480
Welcome to tomato farm.

2358
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:39,840
Welcome.

2359
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:40,280

Let's see...

2361
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,360
Goodbye.

2362
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,480
Oh shit.

2363
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:55,240
Sorry, man.

2364
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:57,660
No, he- How could you do this?

2365
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,220
He was just trying to do his job.

2366
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,420
He was just providing light.

2367
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:02,400
Hahaha.

2368
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,760
He's just providing light to the citizens!

2369
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,660
Okay, let's see.

2370
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,080
I guess I go this way, right?

2371
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:19,200
Toki, you can just lie on the internet.

2372
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,540
What if I'll just... I mean, I could just use the baby.

2373
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,480
I haven't used Big Baby in a long time.

2374
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,600
Wait, oh!

2375
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:27,800
Big Baby doesn't work!

2376
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:30,240
Wait a second!

2377
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:33,560
I didn't know Big Baby is also magic!

2378
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:36,680
Oh shit!

2379
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:37,000
Okay.

2380
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:39,920
I just saw Big Baby as his own thing!

2381
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,940
Big Baby was just Big Baby!

2382
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,820
How the fuck was Big Baby not just Big Baby?!

2383
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,780
Big Baby is now sealed.

2384
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,260
Okay, let's see if I can get him from here.

2385
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:54,960
Nice.

2386
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:56,160
What the fuck?!

2387
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:56,420
Okay!

2388
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:59,200
I am here now!

2389
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:01,800
Okay.

2390
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:03,400
It said magic?

2391
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:03,940
Big Baby is magic!

2392
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:04,480
He's in magic?

2393
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,040
He's just a part of me!

2394
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:08,900
We all have a big baby inside of us.

2395
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,260
Oh yeah, Mint was the one that played those, not me.

2396
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,080
Okay.

2397
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,660
I saw that too.

2398
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,120
Alright.

2399
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:20,680
Oh shit!

2400
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:22,620
Okay, I need heal.

2401
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:26,810
Okay, nice.

2402
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:27,330
Get out.

2403
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:27,650
Get out!

2404
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:27,890
Oh!

2405
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:28,370
Oh no!

2406
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:29,110
Alright.

2407
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:30,250
It's alright.

2408
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:30,950
Everything's fine.

2409
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:32,510
It's okay.

2410
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:33,690
He's gonna slowly come over.

2411
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:37,250
Alright.

2412
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:38,730
He's gonna... He's gonna get closer.

2413
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:40,090
Alright.

2414
01:39:40,190 --> 01:39:41,890
He's gonna... He's gonna get closer, right?

2415
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:42,730
Alright.

2416
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:43,730
I can hold this for a while.

2417
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:43,990
Hey!

2418
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:45,010
Come on!

2419
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:46,230
I'm ready!

2420
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:46,750
Come on!

2421
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:47,570
I still have half!

2422
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:48,730
Half my stamina!

2423
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:49,710
Please get closer!

2424
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:51,330
Please get closer!

2425
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:52,190
Yeah!

2426
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:53,990
Okay.

2427
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:54,910
Thank god.

2428
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:55,390
I was gonna...

2429
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:58,070
I thought he was just gonna stand there, messingly.

2430
01:39:59,110 --> 01:39:59,990
He's stuck!

2431
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:02,330
He'll get there soon!

2432
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:02,970
Eventually!

2433
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:03,170
Eventually!

2434
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:06,510
Oh my god.

2435
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:07,450
Even you die slow.

2436
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:10,070
Patient pays off.

2437
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:11,810
Yay!

2438
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,710
There's a brew there?

2439
01:40:18,190 --> 01:40:19,190
Oh, he's a prince?

2440
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:22,150
Nice.

2441
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:24,770
Now I shall be prince of the scorpions.

2442
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:27,830
Okay.

2443
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:28,050
Oh!

2444
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:28,690
There's trees!

2445
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:30,170
Alright.

2446
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:30,830
What is this?

2447
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:36,880
Alright.

2448
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:37,600
Let's see.

2449
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:42,720
I was the... I was the... I was the... the...

2450
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,300
The Newground viewers that used to watch Egoraptor.

2451
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,200
Is that Egoraptor?

2452
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:52,540
Bro, Egoraptor... Sorry.

2453
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,380
Aaron Hansen.

2454
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:54,780
He's now called Aaron Hansen.

2455
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:55,880
Oh my god.

2456
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,860
He's like 36 or something now.

2457
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,320
And like... What's his name?

2458
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:02,820
Dan... Dan Avedon is like in his 40s.

2459
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:05,900
Or older.

2460
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,160
Isn't he older than 36?

2461
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,280
Or is he 36?

2462
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:15,770
Alright.

2463
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:17,370
We go... this way.

2464
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:17,790
Right?

2465
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:18,470
Is this the brew?

2466
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:21,670
Oh, he's in his 50s now?

2467
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:22,590
Holy shit.

2468
01:41:24,450 --> 01:41:26,150
And they're still doing Game Grumps.

2469
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:29,510
I don't know.

2470
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:30,830
That should be like...

2471
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:36,330
Some people say I play video games just like Aaron Hansen from Game Grumps.

2472
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:38,510
And I don't think they meant that as a compliment.

2473
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:49,330
Guys, I... I don't think they meant that as a... as a good thing.

2474
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:51,610
They do not.

2475
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:54,510
Guys, I sometimes read.

2476
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:55,570
Like...

2477
01:41:57,490 --> 01:41:59,490
Sometimes I read.

2478
01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:01,590
I'm already...

2479
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:04,150
Look.

2480
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:07,110
10% is still 10% more.

2481
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:09,430
I don't even know what Game Grumps does.

2482
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:11,910
Alright.

2483
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:13,690
Alright.

2484
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:14,070
Nice.

2485
01:42:14,150 --> 01:42:14,610
We did it.

2486
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:16,090
Yeah!

2487
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:17,150
I beat video games!

2488
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:17,710
Exactly!

2489
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:19,950
Even if I don't...

2490
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:23,790
Even if I don't read fully...

2491
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:26,130
At least I still beat the game.

2492
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:28,210
That's something!

2493
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:34,330
Toki is glad.

2494
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:35,470
How can she read?

2495
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:36,550
That's true.

2496
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:38,570
Oh!

2497
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:39,430
Nice.

2498
01:42:43,550 --> 01:42:44,370
Is that it?

2499
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:46,690
Oh my god.

2500
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:48,570
There's so many places to go.

2501
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:53,440
Have I been here?

2502
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:54,540
No.

2503
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:55,880
I haven't broke the jars yet.

2504
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:03,380
I'm like trying to use the jars as like indicators of if I've been there or not.

2505
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:04,620
No.

2506
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:04,980
I have.

2507
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:05,980
This is where I could...

2508
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:06,160
Wait.

2509
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:06,360
No.

2510
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:06,720
I have.

2511
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:07,600
This is...

2512
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,640
I think I went backwards!

2513
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:12,560
This is where I killed the fucking Scorpion Prince!

2514
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:13,080
Okay.

2515
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,000
Nevermind.

2516
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:15,360
I just forgot to kill...

2517
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,640
I just forgot to hit those specific jars.

2518
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:20,480
Alright.

2519
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:21,120
It's fine.

2520
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:24,660
I didn't echolocate hard enough.

2521
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:26,880
There's a spawn in the sack.

2522
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:27,480
Another one.

2523
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,520
I never complain!

2524
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:33,840
There's no...

2525
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:37,680
And I never lie on the internet.

2526
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:38,640
Hahaha!

2527
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:39,260
Hahaha!

2528
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:43,680
Alright.

2529
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,700
Let's see what I got.

2530
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:44,840
Oh!

2531
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:45,340
I got the brew!

2532
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,840
Guys.

2533
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:48,780
It's not complaining.

2534
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,260
It's called critiquing.

2535
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:51,980
Hahaha!

2536
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:58,300
I am just giving an honest journalistic critique.

2537
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:00,800
Oh!

2538
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,780
Another spider lady?

2539
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:04,960
How many spider ladies are there?

2540
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,100
How many spider ladies are there?

2541
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:10,560
How does it still kill my frames?

2542
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:13,660
How many polygons does the spider lady have?

2543
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:14,820
Hahaha!

2544
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:16,120
Hahaha!

2545
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:20,420
How many polygons do you have, spider lady?

2546
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:29,460
All of them.

2547
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,060
Not enough.

2548
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:32,680
Is this the story similar to the...

2549
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:35,860
Steven Chao movie with the two spider ladies?

2550
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:38,760
Okay.

2551
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:39,500
Remove.

2552
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:43,260
Haha!

2553
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,780
The polygons.

2554
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:50,050
Alright.

2555
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:50,490
Nice.

2556
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:53,230
Alright.

2557
01:44:53,790 --> 01:44:54,350
Taking...

2558
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:54,570
Okay.

2559
01:44:54,630 --> 01:44:56,610
Now that I know it doesn't fucking work.

2560
01:44:56,690 --> 01:44:58,430
I'm putting back my shadows to medium.

2561
01:44:58,530 --> 01:44:59,530
It doesn't work.

2562
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:02,250
How the fuck do I fix this?

2563
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:03,750
Okay.

2564
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:04,370
Apply.

2565
01:45:05,650 --> 01:45:07,850
I guess we're just gonna look at the...

2566
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:08,970
I don't...

2567
01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:11,210
It is a critique!

2568
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:15,910
It is a...

2569
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:17,930
It is a critique!

2570
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:22,790
It's not complaining.

2571
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:29,090
It was...

2572
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:30,150
It's my voice!

2573
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:31,730
It's just my intonation!

2574
01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:34,170
Okay.

2575
01:45:34,290 --> 01:45:35,270
Where do I go?

2576
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:38,110
It isn't though!

2577
01:45:40,630 --> 01:45:41,270
Alright.

2578
01:45:41,370 --> 01:45:41,790
This way.

2579
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:44,070
Okay.

2580
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:46,330
Let's get rid of this guy first.

2581
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:47,810
Nice.

2582
01:45:48,490 --> 01:45:52,590
Is there special settings for just the spider lady?

2583
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:55,890
Can I lower the spider lady's polygons?

2584
01:45:55,970 --> 01:45:57,450
That's like all I want.

2585
01:45:57,690 --> 01:45:58,330
Hahaha!

2586
01:45:59,550 --> 01:46:03,410
Whatever is up with that spider lady is killing my frames.

2587
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:08,380
Alright.

2588
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:09,180
Let's see.

2589
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:10,940
I don't even know where to go anymore.

2590
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:13,700
I feel like I'm just forever lost.

2591
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:18,850
Uh...

2592
01:46:20,330 --> 01:46:21,550
This is such a...

2593
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:22,190
Oh my god.

2594
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:22,590
There's...

2595
01:46:22,590 --> 01:46:23,590
That's a deep hole.

2596
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:26,290
I'm pretty sure I have to go there soon.

2597
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:27,850
Are you serious?

2598
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:29,970
There's so many like...

2599
01:46:29,970 --> 01:46:32,170
tunnels and directions to go.

2600
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:35,750
Oh.

2601
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:36,790
Get rid of the worm.

2602
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:38,350
No worm for you.

2603
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:39,710
Nobody loves you.

2604
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:44,950
These are the worms where the boyfriends or girlfriends say, No, I do not love you.

2605
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:45,590
You were a worm.

2606
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:47,910
That's what they look like.

2607
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:52,450
This is where they go when their significant other says no.

2608
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:55,510
Alright.

2609
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:59,250
Turning down reflection quality and global illumination?

2610
01:46:59,530 --> 01:46:59,790
Okay.

2611
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:01,110
Hahaha!

2612
01:47:05,570 --> 01:47:06,830
The poor worms.

2613
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:10,590
I'll put you out of your misery.

2614
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:13,770
The unlovable worms.

2615
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:15,790
Alright.

2616
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:16,170
Nice.

2617
01:47:16,570 --> 01:47:17,090
Okay.

2618
01:47:17,110 --> 01:47:21,130
Turn down reflection quality and global illumination.

2619
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:21,450
Okay.

2620
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:21,870
I'll try that.

2621
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:23,550
Uh...

2622
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:24,870
I'll put that.

2623
01:47:25,390 --> 01:47:26,490
And then reflection.

2624
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:27,470
Alright.

2625
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:29,050
Let's see how shitty the game looks now.

2626
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:31,030
It's not that bad.

2627
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:31,970
Oh wait.

2628
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:34,170
No.

2629
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:35,030
This is pretty...

2630
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:35,590
Hahaha!

2631
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:40,430
Okay.

2632
01:47:40,510 --> 01:47:40,690
No.

2633
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:41,330
It looks pretty good.

2634
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:41,570
It's pretty ugly.

2635
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:42,310
No.

2636
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:42,830
Hahaha!

2637
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:44,910
Oh my god!

2638
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:45,710
Hahaha!

2639
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:48,330
Wait.

2640
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:49,410
Hahaha!

2641
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:56,750
The realization was...

2642
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:58,110
I was like, okay, wait.

2643
01:47:58,190 --> 01:47:58,370
No.

2644
01:47:58,370 --> 01:47:59,450
It's actually pretty bad.

2645
01:47:59,690 --> 01:48:01,230
It actually is.

2646
01:48:03,730 --> 01:48:04,670
Oh shit.

2647
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:05,750
Okay.

2648
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:07,950
We got to get rid of the flies first.

2649
01:48:08,870 --> 01:48:10,050
It's a no-fly zone!

2650
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:10,770
Remember that!

2651
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:14,470
It's fine.

2652
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:15,310
It's just one guy.

2653
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:17,210
Get him out of here.

2654
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:23,410
It's only for spotted lady!

2655
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:24,710
It's fine.

2656
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:28,150
Oh, brew.

2657
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:30,610
Do I have another one?

2658
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:31,230
What's this?

2659
01:48:33,790 --> 01:48:36,750
It's like say poison state to the destined one himself?

2660
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:38,430
Okay.

2661
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:38,650
No.

2662
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:40,290
What's this?

2663
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:47,680
When that critical health massively increases the recovery?

2664
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:49,500
Hmm.

2665
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,180
I don't think that's worth it.

2666
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,240
I don't know.

2667
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,580
I like the mana.

2668
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:58,300
Actually, I should...

2669
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:00,720
I don't know because it's 24%.

2670
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:06,920
Yeah.

2671
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,100
I don't think it's worth it.

2672
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:11,640
The mana is definitely not worth it because I don't use mana anymore.

2673
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,460
So I should get rid of that.

2674
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:14,440
Okay.

2675
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:15,340
I should use something else.

2676
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:16,860
Yeah.

2677
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:17,840
I'm gonna get the movement speed.

2678
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:19,820
Laurel and peach pit.

2679
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:22,860
I'm gonna get this cause I don't use...

2680
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:24,900
Uhhhhhh...

2681
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:26,600
I don't use any of these.

2682
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:28,600
Peach pit...

2683
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,540
I might as well just try this.

2684
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,120
What does the poison state mean?

2685
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:34,220
What is the...

2686
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:37,620
Is it like I can get somebody to get poisoned?

2687
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,380
Do they get poison or something?

2688
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:46,450
Is that what it is?

2689
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:51,190
Oh, I get- Why the fuck would I use this?

2690
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:55,290
But I wanna be poisoned!

2691
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:59,290
There's like nothing- There's no other positivity!

2692
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:06,330
Oh, there's a weapon where I hit harder if I'm poisoned.

2693
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:07,890
I was gonna say that's so fucked.

2694
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:09,970
What if I just poison myself?

2695
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:14,270
I wouldn't think of that first.

2696
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:23,010
The risk versus- Nobody is gonna kill me, I'm just gonna poison myself.

2697
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:25,490
I'll finish my own job.

2698
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:29,350
You know, as a joke.

2699
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:34,950
Alright, I'm pretty sure something's gonna- Oh no?

2700
01:50:35,290 --> 01:50:36,530
I get this for free?

2701
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:39,190
I get this for free?

2702
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:40,210
Me?

2703
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:40,310
Me?

2704
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:44,470
I'm doing myself.

2705
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:50,510
Alright, get back up though.

2706
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:52,090
The fuck?

2707
01:50:53,230 --> 01:50:54,210
Can I get back up?

2708
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:55,210
I can't get back up either?

2709
01:50:57,230 --> 01:50:58,090
There's no way.

2710
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:01,510
No, I should be able to- Oh, it's over here.

2711
01:51:01,670 --> 01:51:02,590
This tiny rock.

2712
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:04,670
Okay, it was this tiny rock.

2713
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:08,190
Uhh...

2714
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:09,870
Alright.

2715
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:11,950
I guess I live here- Woah!

2716
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:13,010
Oh, it's you again!

2717
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:14,590
I haven't seen you in a long time!

2718
01:51:18,330 --> 01:51:19,030
Alright, nice.

2719
01:51:20,490 --> 01:51:24,310
Sometimes they have- Okay, it's like five- Oh wait, rice cocoon.

2720
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:24,690
Okay.

2721
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:27,710
I heard the rice cocoon is for a quest, so I might as well.

2722
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:31,690
These guys are like not that scary compared to like the spiders.

2723
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:34,350
The spider- The spider monsters.

2724
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:35,870
The spider monsters are like a pain in the ass.

2725
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:40,170
Alright, nice.

2726
01:51:40,430 --> 01:51:40,670
Alright.

2727
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:43,210
I guess I'll go this way?

2728
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:46,110
Oh, that's a- Wow.

2729
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:48,330
That looks very threatening.

2730
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:54,350
Guys, do you think this is dangerous?

2731
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:56,010
They're not monkey skulls.

2732
01:51:56,010 --> 01:52:03,490
So like- All I'm saying is that they're not monkey skulls.

2733
01:52:03,490 --> 01:52:10,510
So like, you know, they could be like- It could be safe, you know?

2734
01:52:10,770 --> 01:52:12,990
If they're not monkey skulls.

2735
01:52:12,990 --> 01:52:15,770
Like, maybe it has a preference for humans only.

2736
01:52:16,290 --> 01:52:19,390
Like- Can't be that bad.

2737
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:20,930
Oh, there's a cutscene.

2738
01:52:21,290 --> 01:52:22,570
Oh, they're- Oh!

2739
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:24,450
Oh, centipig, why?

2740
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:25,730
Oh, no!

2741
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:30,850
Why the fuck- Okay.

2742
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:32,110
This is fucked.

2743
01:52:32,150 --> 01:52:37,550
Cause like, he- He basically made it so I couldn't- Are you serious?

2744
01:52:38,570 --> 01:52:42,030
Guys- Guys, I'm gonna die so I can-

2745
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:49,350
I'm gonna die on purpose, guys.

2746
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:53,950
I've been first trying way too many times.

2747
01:52:58,030 --> 01:53:01,150
I'm gonna die for the views, guys.

2748
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:03,190
Guys, I'm gonna die for the views right now.

2749
01:53:03,190 --> 01:53:03,590
Okay?

2750
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:05,410
If I die, it's not because I'm bad.

2751
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:09,790
Wait, he was rest- Wait, I could've just- Oh, my God!

2752
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:15,500
Like-

2753
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,100
Okay, nice.

2754
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:21,740
Not nice.

2755
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:23,040
Not nice.

2756
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:30,960
Okay, now that I know that when he- When he does the pill for him, like- That's just nothing.

2757
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:33,040
Alright, bee poisoning isn't so bad.

2758
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:36,140
Like- It's just a way of life.

2759
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,360
It's just a little bit, you know?

2760
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:40,920
It's just a little joke.

2761
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,280
Okay- Oh, that's why!

2762
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,140
He hit his head and now he's like- I'm sad.

2763
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,860
Like, that's understandable, you know?

2764
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:53,280
That's understandable.

2765
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:55,980
Anybody would be sad after.

2766
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,620
Oh, what does that do?

2767
01:53:58,620 --> 01:53:59,440
What the fuck?

2768
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:02,560
Oh, that's what- What the fuck?!

2769
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:03,920
What the fuck?!

2770
01:54:06,290 --> 01:54:07,250
Oh, God.

2771
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:08,390
Oh, God.

2772
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:09,110
This is not fair.

2773
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:11,770
Oh, God.

2774
01:54:11,890 --> 01:54:12,210
Please.

2775
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:14,030
Guys, remember.

2776
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:15,690
If I die- Guys, remember.

2777
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:22,310
If I die, it's just- It's just- It's just for funny.

2778
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:26,930
It's just for the views, guys.

2779
01:54:27,030 --> 01:54:27,610
Remember that.

2780
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:31,830
I'm only doing it for the views.

2781
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:35,390
It's not because I'm bad.

2782
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:39,190
Oh, God.

2783
01:54:41,950 --> 01:54:42,670
Come on.

2784
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:43,550
He's so low.

2785
01:54:43,650 --> 01:54:44,210
Please.

2786
01:54:45,470 --> 01:54:46,030
Yes!

2787
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:46,510
Yes!

2788
01:54:46,830 --> 01:54:48,330
I don't need the views.

2789
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:54,130
I don't need- That's fucking right!

2790
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:57,990
First try!

2791
01:54:58,130 --> 01:54:58,590
Wow!

2792
01:54:58,750 --> 01:54:59,710
Another one!

2793
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:01,870
No views.

2794
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:06,430
Jesus Christ.

2795
01:55:06,530 --> 01:55:07,730
Why he's so ugly?

2796
01:55:07,870 --> 01:55:08,370
I don't know.

2797
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:14,730
Raw seeds grow in ancient silence.

2798
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:15,830
Someone cast- Oh, no.

2799
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:19,070
Is it like- Something is super- Like, important?

2800
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:20,970
I'm sorry for calling you ugly.

2801
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:25,150
The content dogi!

2802
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:30,910
The content- All right.

2803
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:31,230
Nice.

2804
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:32,670
I just want to look at what I missed.

2805
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:36,050
Novel in Captain- Oh.

2806
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:37,090
Oh, I killed all of these guys.

2807
01:55:38,290 --> 01:55:39,430
The wolf archer.

2808
01:55:39,450 --> 01:55:40,250
What about the bugs?

2809
01:55:40,450 --> 01:55:41,070
Oh, there they are.

2810
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:42,630
The puppet spider.

2811
01:55:43,090 --> 01:55:44,650
The grasshopper.

2812
01:55:44,650 --> 01:55:45,630
The wasp.

2813
01:55:45,790 --> 01:55:47,070
The stone spider.

2814
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:49,270
The worm.

2815
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:51,070
The claw.

2816
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:52,190
Oh, the claw cocoon.

2817
01:55:53,570 --> 01:55:55,110
And the scorpion prince.

2818
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,580
Just follow the script, please!

2819
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:06,040
Toki!

2820
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,920
You're supposed to lose!

2821
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:10,080
Stop killing all of them!

2822
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:11,980
I missed two monk boss?

2823
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:12,800
I could go back.

2824
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:14,460
Instant transmission.

2825
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,400
Wait, where do I go?

2826
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:23,020
Stop deeming!

2827
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:27,980
Guys, you have to be specific on where to go.

2828
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,960
Because, like, we have a problem.

2829
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:31,700
Hahaha!

2830
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,660
Over there.

2831
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:45,230
Guys, so where do I go?

2832
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:48,250
Oh, chapter three?

2833
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:48,910
Okay.

2834
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:50,530
Chapter three?

2835
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:51,870
I have to go all the way back?

2836
01:56:53,290 --> 01:56:54,270
How do I get there?

2837
01:56:56,810 --> 01:56:57,690
Chapter three?

2838
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:59,730
Wait, when did I kill another monk?

2839
01:57:00,170 --> 01:57:03,130
I killed so many things, like, I can't tell anymore.

2840
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:06,130
Chapter three?

2841
01:57:06,130 --> 01:57:06,130
Okay.

2842
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:08,850
Alright, where else?

2843
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:09,730
Where do I have to go?

2844
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:13,470
Guys, you have to be very specific as to what the monk is.

2845
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:15,490
Like, I've killed so many things.

2846
01:57:19,570 --> 01:57:20,090
Thunderclap.

2847
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:21,490
Thunderclap.

2848
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:23,590
What is the thunderclap thing?

2849
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:25,070
Is this chapter three?

2850
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:29,450
There's no thunderclap here.

2851
01:57:33,110 --> 01:57:33,950
The first?

2852
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:35,570
Oh, the old dude!

2853
01:57:35,930 --> 01:57:36,190
Oh!

2854
01:57:36,790 --> 01:57:37,770
That guy!

2855
01:57:40,510 --> 01:57:42,630
The new thunderclap temple.

2856
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:43,950
Oh, there it is!

2857
01:57:44,150 --> 01:57:45,270
Oh, there's just the beginning?

2858
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:48,690
Is it, uh, a temple entrance?

2859
01:57:49,210 --> 01:57:49,970
That guy!

2860
01:57:50,150 --> 01:57:52,370
The guy that killed his fox wife!

2861
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:54,490
Alright.

2862
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:55,770
Wait, how did they appear?

2863
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:58,550
Why did they appear again?

2864
01:57:59,270 --> 01:58:00,910
Didn't I kill the monks already?

2865
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:01,890
Or did I not?

2866
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:06,150
Did I, like, miss the... did I miss the optional...

2867
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:07,050
optional bosses from them?

2868
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:09,410
When I did chapter three?

2869
01:58:10,070 --> 01:58:11,070
Did I miss it?

2870
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:14,610
Or, like, did they only appear after I finished chapter three?

2871
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:24,460
Alright.

2872
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:30,080
Did they, like, appear after I finished chapter three or did I just miss it?

2873
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:32,000
I can't tell, guys.

2874
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:38,980
Oh, I just missed it then.

2875
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:39,460
Okay.

2876
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:41,540
Oh, shit.

2877
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,520
When did you get so strong?

2878
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:43,480
What the fuck?

2879
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,700
When did these guys get so strong?

2880
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:48,140
They're just mobs!

2881
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:51,780
What the fuck?

2882
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:54,060
Holy shit.

2883
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:55,000
Okay, this is it.

2884
01:58:57,740 --> 01:58:58,200
Alright.

2885
01:58:58,820 --> 01:58:59,640
I don't know...

2886
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:01,100
I don't understand.

2887
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:02,420
I used to be so strong.

2888
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:03,040
What happened?

2889
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:04,060
What happened?

2890
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:05,380
What happened?

2891
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:07,440
How did he get so strong?

2892
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:09,380
How did he get so strong?

2893
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,260
How did you get just a mob?

2894
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:13,540
Oh my god.

2895
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:15,940
You were just...

2896
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:17,500
Oh, I was at the wrong area.

2897
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:18,040
Okay.

2898
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,620
I wasn't even supposed to be here.

2899
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:21,360
Like, like...

2900
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:24,660
Dude, they only give me, like, 393.

2901
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:25,520
It's not even that much.

2902
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:30,100
Alright.

2903
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,760
So, it's the...

2904
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:33,940
Alright, so it has to be at the end of it then.

2905
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:34,780
Uh...

2906
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:35,160
Oh, wait.

2907
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:36,300
I need to rest anyway.

2908
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:37,960
Uh...

2909
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,020
Web parlor...

2910
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:39,840
Wait, no, not web parlor.

2911
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:41,560
Uh...

2912
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,360
The hall.

2913
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:48,180
It's him, the god of war.

2914
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:50,920
It's him.

2915
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:54,520
Okay, to the left.

2916
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:56,160
To the left, to the left.

2917
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,020
Alright, are they still guarding?

2918
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:02,180
Why are you still guarding?

2919
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:02,760
They're dead.

2920
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,160
Alright, how much HP am I gonna lose?

2921
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:06,820
Guys.

2922
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:08,040
I'm gonna do a flip.

2923
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:10,460
Guys, I'm gonna do a flip.

2924
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:12,560
Guys, I'm going to do a flip.

2925
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:13,820
Guys, I'll do it.

2926
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:19,520
Guys, you think I won't?

2927
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:23,100
Haha!

2928
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:24,740
There, see?

2929
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:25,800
I did...

2930
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:26,320
Did you see the flip?

2931
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:27,220
It was so fast.

2932
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:29,760
The human eye could not comprehend it.

2933
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:34,140
Wait, let me get the camera.

2934
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,120
Haha!

2935
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:35,560
Haha!

2936
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,000
Haha!

2937
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:36,840
Haha!

2938
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:36,900
Haha!

2939
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:38,020
Haha!

2940
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:40,820
No!

2941
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:43,420
Okay, nice.

2942
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:44,640
Is this the left side?

2943
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:48,980
Wait, I went right.

2944
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,680
I'm gonna grab some water.

2945
02:00:55,900 --> 02:01:01,080
I went right.

2946
02:01:21,650 --> 02:01:22,310
Okay.

2947
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:34,190
It was very obvious where it was.

2948
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:36,330
Instructions unclear.

2949
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:38,990
I lost the 50-50.

2950
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:41,430
Guys, I don't know how.

2951
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:43,430
I lost the 50-50.

2952
02:01:44,010 --> 02:01:44,670
Alright.

2953
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:46,910
Alright, here we go.

2954
02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:48,810
I'm gonna do a flip again!

2955
02:01:49,750 --> 02:01:51,290
I'm gonna flip again.

2956
02:01:51,310 --> 02:01:51,750
Flip again!

2957
02:01:53,070 --> 02:01:54,270
Okay, let's see.

2958
02:01:55,230 --> 02:01:57,210
Oh wait, I don't have to do a flip.

2959
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:58,010
Oh no, I do.

2960
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:59,630
It's an invisible wall.

2961
02:02:01,090 --> 02:02:03,050
Oh, JK, I lose 0 HP.

2962
02:02:03,170 --> 02:02:04,010
Let's fucking go.

2963
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:07,510
Guys, I lost the 50-50.

2964
02:02:11,710 --> 02:02:12,310
Alright.

2965
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:16,210
Here I come.

2966
02:02:18,490 --> 02:02:19,950
Here I come.

2967
02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:21,830
But your god's dead.

2968
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:24,370
Non-pure?

2969
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:25,450
Wait, you're not pure?

2970
02:02:27,490 --> 02:02:28,790
Wait, why do you have a...

2971
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:29,650
Oh shit!

2972
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:30,830
Oh my god!

2973
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:31,350
Okay.

2974
02:02:31,890 --> 02:02:33,750
What if I just meditate in front of you?

2975
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:34,470
Wouldn't that be funny?

2976
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:40,030
Unless...

2977
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:43,270
Okay, let's get...

2978
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:43,770
Oh shit!

2979
02:02:45,030 --> 02:02:47,170
Let's just have full HP just in case.

2980
02:02:47,550 --> 02:02:48,770
Like, I don't wanna risk it.

2981
02:02:48,930 --> 02:02:50,770
I don't wanna risk it.

2982
02:02:50,850 --> 02:02:51,670
In general.

2983
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:56,210
Wait, is he block...

2984
02:02:56,210 --> 02:02:57,910
I can't tell if he's blocking me or not.

2985
02:02:58,710 --> 02:02:59,150
Alright.

2986
02:02:59,350 --> 02:03:01,990
Cause he's holding his hand out as if he's blocking me.

2987
02:03:02,230 --> 02:03:04,130
But like, he's... Oh shit!

2988
02:03:04,990 --> 02:03:05,850
Alright, that's fine.

2989
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:07,270
Boom!

2990
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:07,950
Wow!

2991
02:03:08,970 --> 02:03:09,410
Wow!

2992
02:03:11,190 --> 02:03:14,070
Haha, you missed, bitch.

2993
02:03:15,630 --> 02:03:16,830
I did not mean that.

2994
02:03:16,870 --> 02:03:17,610
I'm so sorry.

2995
02:03:18,130 --> 02:03:19,230
I'm so sorry.

2996
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:22,510
Let me charge it up.

2997
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:26,050
I imagine missing.

2998
02:03:26,290 --> 02:03:26,730
I imagine missing.

2999
02:03:26,730 --> 02:03:27,850
Oh shit, I'm so sorry.

3000
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:32,310
I don't mean that.

3001
02:03:32,370 --> 02:03:32,930
I don't mean that.

3002
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:33,530
I don't mean that.

3003
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:34,050
I don't mean that!

3004
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:35,290
No!

3005
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:39,290
Oh, it's okay.

3006
02:03:39,430 --> 02:03:39,790
It's okay.

3007
02:03:42,370 --> 02:03:42,810
Nice.

3008
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:48,200
Okay, so low.

3009
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:48,900
He's so low.

3010
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:49,660
Come on!

3011
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:49,880
Yes!

3012
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:51,200
Easy.

3013
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:54,560
So fucking easy.

3014
02:03:55,100 --> 02:03:55,620
Absorb.

3015
02:03:57,160 --> 02:04:00,200
Sorry, I forgot to use my echolocation there.

3016
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:09,180
I keep forgetting to echolocate.

3017
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:11,440
Oh, I get to meditate.

3018
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:12,200
Nice.

3019
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:23,910
No longer shall I pretend I'm bad at this game.

3020
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:24,570
Hahaha.

3021
02:04:27,610 --> 02:04:31,790
I will no longer pretend I'm bad at this game for views.

3022
02:04:32,310 --> 02:04:34,650
I will prove them all wrong.

3023
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:36,050
Hahaha.

3024
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:37,930
Hahaha.

3025
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:44,170
It is no longer for content anymore.

3026
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:51,060
She's changed.

3027
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:55,120
She got one guy so hard.

3028
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:56,080
Hahaha.

3029
02:04:57,100 --> 02:05:01,860
She got one guy so hard that she's actually locked in.

3030
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:04,300
Alright.

3031
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:06,520
Where do we go next?

3032
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:08,340
Wait, where's the other monk?

3033
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:09,700
No key.

3034
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:10,860
This is not part.

3035
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:13,360
He lives rent free in my head.

3036
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:14,240
Hahaha.

3037
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:16,880
Hahaha.

3038
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:18,720
I'll go down the stairs.

3039
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:19,220
Okay.

3040
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:19,400
Okay.

3041
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:23,780
This spider's too powerful.

3042
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:24,860
Hahaha.

3043
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:28,600
Alright.

3044
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:31,460
Wait, how did he see me?

3045
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:33,960
I'm just walking down the stairs.

3046
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:37,860
Okay, where do I go from here?

3047
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:41,580
Book of bliss?

3048
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:42,080
Okay.

3049
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:44,380
Instant transmission.

3050
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:47,640
Pagoda realm.

3051
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:48,240
Alright.

3052
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:54,740
Alright.

3053
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:56,620
Pagoda realm.

3054
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:58,180
Just a little guy.

3055
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,240
Travel in the west.

3056
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:06,560
Where do we go?

3057
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:07,620
In pagoda realm?

3058
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:10,900
Uhhhhh.

3059
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:12,220
Uhhhhh.

3060
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:16,760
I already did the fox quest so we're missing a monk.

3061
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:19,360
I'm just a little guy.

3062
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:22,760
Valley of ecstasy.

3063
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:24,720
It's not in pagoda realm.

3064
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:25,580
What the fuck?

3065
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:29,380
Guys, you're giving me different locations.

3066
02:06:31,740 --> 02:06:34,660
Guys, you're giving me different locations.

3067
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:36,100
Which one is it?

3068
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:38,360
Which one is it?

3069
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:40,920
Is it valley or is it pagoda realm?

3070
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:43,680
Book of bliss?

3071
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:46,040
Book of bliss.

3072
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:48,400
Okay, here.

3073
02:06:55,390 --> 02:06:55,990
Okay.

3074
02:06:57,030 --> 02:06:59,350
We're at the book of bliss.

3075
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:05,510
Alright, here we are.

3076
02:07:06,090 --> 02:07:07,070
Now where do we go?

3077
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:10,090
I don't even remember this location.

3078
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:11,790
Like, when did I get here?

3079
02:07:17,510 --> 02:07:18,690
Up the stairs?

3080
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:19,170
Okay.

3081
02:07:20,290 --> 02:07:21,630
When was I ever here?

3082
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:27,350
Oh hey, there's two wills here.

3083
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:31,450
Is this left?

3084
02:07:32,090 --> 02:07:33,070
No, this was right.

3085
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:37,720
Where?

3086
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:40,380
This way, right?

3087
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:41,280
Is that left?

3088
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:44,940
Yeah, but I saw like...

3089
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:46,620
Guys, I couldn't help it.

3090
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:47,740
I saw will.

3091
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:51,120
I needed xp.

3092
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:52,480
Guys, xp important.

3093
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:56,180
Can we go up?

3094
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:58,920
Oh, is it that tower over there?

3095
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:02,160
Okay, no, it's not.

3096
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:03,120
Oh, is it him?

3097
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:06,320
Is it this guy?

3098
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:07,360
The non-A-bun?

3099
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:09,600
What you gonna do?

3100
02:08:09,980 --> 02:08:11,220
You don't have arms?

3101
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:12,300
Oh shit!

3102
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:14,780
What are you doing?

3103
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:15,620
You're fucking dancing!

3104
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,100
Bro, this guy should be brick dancing!

3105
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:19,320
Like...

3106
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:23,640
Bro, this guy should represent Australia brick dancing!

3107
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:26,100
Holy shit, look at him!

3108
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:26,680
Go!

3109
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:29,780
Guys, I think he might have two phases.

3110
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:31,640
Because he's gonna be able to...

3111
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:33,080
Guys, there's no way.

3112
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:34,100
There's no way.

3113
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:39,200
No, he no.

3114
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:42,460
Ray gun.

3115
02:08:47,130 --> 02:08:48,490
Oh my god, look at him!

3116
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:49,310
He just did the move!

3117
02:08:50,490 --> 02:08:51,550
That's better than the kill!

3118
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:53,810
He literally...

3119
02:08:53,810 --> 02:08:56,870
He literally fucking... look at him go!

3120
02:08:57,790 --> 02:08:59,190
He spun on his head.

3121
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:00,890
He's got the moves!

3122
02:09:04,830 --> 02:09:05,830
Alright, nice.

3123
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:07,170
Oh, that is definitely it.

3124
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:07,510
Alright.

3125
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:10,250
Kill without...

3126
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:12,470
Is he still non-A-bun?

3127
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:14,110
Guys, I don't...

3128
02:09:14,110 --> 02:09:16,310
God, you have your arms now!

3129
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:18,070
You gotta change your name!

3130
02:09:19,970 --> 02:09:21,170
Holy fuck!

3131
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:23,170
Oh, okay.

3132
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:24,790
Don't let that happen to you.

3133
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:26,530
I know that now.

3134
02:09:27,790 --> 02:09:29,530
He's able now!

3135
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:30,990
There's no way!

3136
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:32,430
There's no way!

3137
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:35,250
You're still a non-A-bun!

3138
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:39,090
You untied your arms!

3139
02:09:39,510 --> 02:09:41,530
Your name doesn't work anymore!

3140
02:09:42,370 --> 02:09:44,650
Your name doesn't work anymore!

3141
02:09:45,850 --> 02:09:46,570
Okay.

3142
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:47,890
It's fine.

3143
02:09:49,870 --> 02:09:51,130
Alright, it's fine.

3144
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:52,510
Oh, shit!

3145
02:09:53,190 --> 02:09:53,910
Guys.

3146
02:09:54,910 --> 02:09:56,230
Guys, I'm desperate.

3147
02:09:58,590 --> 02:09:59,110
No!

3148
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:01,390
No, stop!

3149
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:01,730
No, stop!

3150
02:10:03,070 --> 02:10:04,130
Guys, just remember.

3151
02:10:04,290 --> 02:10:05,670
If I lose, you know why.

3152
02:10:05,910 --> 02:10:08,470
If I lose, you know why.

3153
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:12,350
Guys, I gotta follow the script, guys!

3154
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:14,050
Guys, I gotta follow the script, guys!

3155
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:15,690
I'm just following the script, guys!

3156
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:19,110
I'm just following the script, guys!

3157
02:10:19,150 --> 02:10:19,930
I'm just following the script!

3158
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:20,510
Oh,

3159
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:25,170
she's finally doing it.

3160
02:10:25,170 --> 02:10:26,770
She's finally doing it!

3161
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:36,010
It's all part of the plan.

3162
02:10:36,310 --> 02:10:37,670
For the viewers!

3163
02:10:39,850 --> 02:10:41,290
Oh, my God.

3164
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:44,930
Welcome, new viewers!

3165
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:47,610
Welcome, new viewers!

3166
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:50,650
For the content.

3167
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:52,310
She's engagement farming.

3168
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:55,130
She's finally done it!

3169
02:10:56,790 --> 02:11:00,150
She's finally engagement farming!

3170
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:03,590
She's finally done it!

3171
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:04,810
Now she's relatable!

3172
02:11:05,710 --> 02:11:08,750
I also lost to that boss!

3173
02:11:08,990 --> 02:11:11,370
And she lost to that boss, too!

3174
02:11:12,110 --> 02:11:12,690
And she lost to that boss, too!

3175
02:11:12,690 --> 02:11:13,770
Oh, my God!

3176
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:16,070
She's relatable now!

3177
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:19,910
She's...

3178
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:22,790
I can finally relate to her!

3179
02:11:23,010 --> 02:11:23,650
I can finally relate to her!

3180
02:11:23,650 --> 02:11:26,370
Knowing that, like, we both lost to the same boss!

3181
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:29,670
She's just like me!

3182
02:11:30,270 --> 02:11:30,290
She's just like me!

3183
02:11:30,930 --> 02:11:32,050
Jesus Christ!

3184
02:11:32,650 --> 02:11:35,710
Can you figure out how his fucking movement...

3185
02:11:35,710 --> 02:11:37,310
I'm not thinking right now.

3186
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:41,270
To be fair, I never think.

3187
02:11:42,190 --> 02:11:42,750
Okay.

3188
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:45,950
Okay.

3189
02:11:46,510 --> 02:11:47,230
Okay.

3190
02:11:48,450 --> 02:11:49,090
What?!

3191
02:11:49,090 --> 02:11:50,110
You just stepped!

3192
02:11:50,830 --> 02:11:51,470
Like...

3193
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:55,570
She's a real...

3194
02:11:55,570 --> 02:11:55,870
She's a real...

3195
02:11:59,670 --> 02:12:00,870
Okay, I'm gonna...

3196
02:12:00,870 --> 02:12:02,150
Hydrate real fast.

3197
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:08,750
Oh, how does your defense go up when your arms are untied?

3198
02:12:08,970 --> 02:12:09,130
Oh, how does your defense go up when your arms are untied?

3199
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:10,270
It doesn't make sense!

3200
02:12:10,650 --> 02:12:13,090
Like, it's still the same body!

3201
02:12:13,450 --> 02:12:14,010
Like...

3202
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:17,310
How do you have more defense?

3203
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:20,090
Literally the same body!

3204
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:23,530
Okay.

3205
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:25,150
Come on.

3206
02:12:25,230 --> 02:12:25,730
Get closer.

3207
02:12:26,230 --> 02:12:27,310
Get closer.

3208
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:30,330
The fuse actually went up!

3209
02:12:31,050 --> 02:12:32,650
Wait, did it really?

3210
02:12:33,490 --> 02:12:34,630
Oh, my God!

3211
02:12:34,690 --> 02:12:37,370
I can finally relate to the streamer now!

3212
02:12:37,570 --> 02:12:38,690
Let me watch here.

3213
02:12:41,490 --> 02:12:45,750
He got more angry, so he doesn't feel pain.

3214
02:12:46,090 --> 02:12:47,290
Oh, shit!

3215
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:47,650
Oh, shit!

3216
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:51,570
Oh, God.

3217
02:12:53,590 --> 02:13:02,190
Holy shi- Why is he so much harder than, like, the other non-ape nine months?

3218
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:05,330
Doesn't make fucking sense!

3219
02:13:05,890 --> 02:13:07,750
You're from the same place!

3220
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:09,610
You're from the same place!

3221
02:13:11,330 --> 02:13:12,250
Okay.

3222
02:13:13,030 --> 02:13:13,490
Okay.

3223
02:13:16,130 --> 02:13:17,050
Oh.

3224
02:13:17,310 --> 02:13:17,510
Okay.

3225
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:17,890
All right.

3226
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:18,390
All right.

3227
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:19,010
All right.

3228
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:19,470
All right.

3229
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:20,410
All right.

3230
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:22,330
Fuck me out, I guess.

3231
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:24,890
All right.

3232
02:13:24,910 --> 02:13:25,350
Get closer.

3233
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:26,510
Get closer.

3234
02:13:27,810 --> 02:13:29,130
But not too close.

3235
02:13:31,210 --> 02:13:32,250
Oh, God.

3236
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:32,710
Thank God.

3237
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:34,110
Okay.

3238
02:13:34,210 --> 02:13:34,690
Two tries.

3239
02:13:34,850 --> 02:13:35,090
Okay.

3240
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:39,790
I can feel the veer count go up.

3241
02:13:40,070 --> 02:13:42,190
Thank you for the super chat, Mike.

3242
02:13:42,350 --> 02:13:42,830
Thank you.

3243
02:13:42,850 --> 02:13:43,550
Thank you.

3244
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:45,710
Nice.

3245
02:13:45,730 --> 02:13:46,630
I did it.

3246
02:13:47,110 --> 02:13:48,690
I believed enough.

3247
02:13:49,150 --> 02:13:51,730
I believed enough.

3248
02:13:51,770 --> 02:13:54,170
Now you're not relatable anymore.

3249
02:13:54,530 --> 02:13:55,170
Unsubscribe.

3250
02:13:55,850 --> 02:13:57,150
Close tab.

3251
02:13:58,390 --> 02:13:59,310
Nice.

3252
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:00,930
Instant transmission.

3253
02:14:05,070 --> 02:14:07,190
You did it!

3254
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:17,230
And for that reason, I shall now close the tab.

3255
02:14:21,490 --> 02:14:23,870
Wait, do I have to go to the Great Pagoda now?

3256
02:14:24,490 --> 02:14:25,090
Chat?

3257
02:14:31,130 --> 02:14:33,530
Will you find the fat mob?

3258
02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:35,610
Like, longevity.

3259
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:38,150
Uh...

3260
02:14:39,070 --> 02:14:39,670
Longevity.

3261
02:14:39,670 --> 02:14:40,430
Where the fuck?

3262
02:14:40,570 --> 02:14:41,070
This one?

3263
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:47,750
Back to being lost.

3264
02:14:50,610 --> 02:14:51,210
Here?

3265
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:52,950
What mob?

3266
02:14:54,610 --> 02:14:56,650
S1, thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

3267
02:14:56,830 --> 02:14:57,070
Thank you.

3268
02:14:57,990 --> 02:15:00,910
There's apparently a big mob for armor?

3269
02:15:02,330 --> 02:15:03,870
We are not the same.

3270
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:04,690
I'm leaving.

3271
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:12,000
Can you not unlock it?

3272
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:13,740
Outside of new game plot?

3273
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:15,080
I thought you could unlock it before.

3274
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:16,760
I know about the secret ending.

3275
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:20,680
Or like the second ending.

3276
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:22,980
I'm not gonna pretend.

3277
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,500
I know about the that there is a second ending.

3278
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,480
But like, uh...

3279
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:29,840
I thought you could unlock it before.

3280
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:34,260
I need to beat the chapter 6 final boss.

3281
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:41,680
Now I don't know much about the second ending, but I know that you can unlock the second ending.

3282
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:43,380
By doing stuff.

3283
02:15:44,140 --> 02:15:47,860
Yeah, I thought you could do the second ending before the final boss.

3284
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:51,740
Oh, shit.

3285
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:53,460
Alright, get this out of here.

3286
02:15:56,180 --> 02:15:56,880
Straight up?

3287
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:57,640
Just up?

3288
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:58,060
Okay.

3289
02:15:58,940 --> 02:15:59,380
Up.

3290
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:02,020
I think this is up.

3291
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:03,180
What the fuck?

3292
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:03,520
Okay.

3293
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:05,660
We already killed this guy before.

3294
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:07,240
Wait, do we have to kill him?

3295
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:08,500
Oh, what the fuck?

3296
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:09,240
There's a crow too?

3297
02:16:10,060 --> 02:16:10,500
Oh!

3298
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:12,120
We don't have to kill him.

3299
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:15,700
Oh, him?

3300
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,680
Oh, I thought you meant...

3301
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:19,340
I thought you meant, like, giant mob.

3302
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:22,020
I thought you meant, like, a lot of people.

3303
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:23,480
Not an actual giant.

3304
02:16:23,860 --> 02:16:24,320
Like...

3305
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:28,000
I was like, where's the giant mob?

3306
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:29,920
It can't be that big thing up there.

3307
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:31,440
Like, it can't be him.

3308
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:32,560
Like...

3309
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,100
It's just one guy.

3310
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:40,800
I was gonna be like, that's just one guy and it can't be him.

3311
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:43,860
I didn't...

3312
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:47,420
I didn't realize you mean, like, actual giant mob.

3313
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:51,640
I thought I killed one of these before.

3314
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:53,980
Okay.

3315
02:16:55,780 --> 02:17:00,620
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can unlock this secret boss before you do, uh...

3316
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:02,120
Unless I'm wrong.

3317
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:02,880
I could be wrong.

3318
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:04,040
I'm wrong about a lot of stuff.

3319
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:07,920
Goodbye feet!

3320
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:08,860
Oh, nice!

3321
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:10,800
Keep hitting your feet.

3322
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:13,820
I know I could hit your head, but fuck your feet.

3323
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:16,040
But, like, not fuck your feet, but fuck your feet.

3324
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:16,440
Oh, nice!

3325
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:16,860
I got it!

3326
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:20,360
Boop!

3327
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:25,920
Yeah, you have to do the secret boss before the final boss to unlock it.

3328
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:27,000
I heard about that.

3329
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:28,320
Burrito, thank you for the super chat!

3330
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:29,220
Thank you, thank you!

3331
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:32,040
Alright.

3332
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:37,420
Alright, where do we go?

3333
02:17:40,140 --> 02:17:41,240
Where do we go now?

3334
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:43,420
Can we continue the web hollow?

3335
02:17:43,980 --> 02:17:46,100
I guess I'm at the middle hollow, right?

3336
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:54,820
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat!

3337
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:55,940
Oh, I forgot the chest!

3338
02:17:56,060 --> 02:17:57,140
Oh my god, you're right.

3339
02:17:57,240 --> 02:17:58,740
I forgot, but this can't be that important.

3340
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:00,440
Guys, there's no way!

3341
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:03,000
There's no...

3342
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,280
I'm pretty sure it's not that important.

3343
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:05,780
How important could it be?

3344
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,360
How important was that chest anyway?

3345
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:10,940
Like, it can't be that important!

3346
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:12,240
Hahaha!

3347
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:16,760
There's no way!

3348
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:19,920
There's no way it was that important, guys.

3349
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:21,120
Hahaha!

3350
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:24,520
The iron leaf, Toki!

3351
02:18:25,060 --> 02:18:26,940
Think about the iron!

3352
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:29,360
Bro, I have 40 iron leaves!

3353
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:31,480
I don't need more!

3354
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,760
It's game changing.

3355
02:18:36,480 --> 02:18:37,240
Hahaha!

3356
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:37,560
Hahaha!

3357
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:40,840
Toki!

3358
02:18:41,660 --> 02:18:43,560
Toki, it could be 41!

3359
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:47,120
It could be 41 iron leaves!

3360
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:51,100
Toki, you need the chest for the secret ending!

3361
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:51,640
Toki!

3362
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:58,000
But what if you need 41 iron leaves?

3363
02:18:59,100 --> 02:18:59,820
41!

3364
02:19:03,390 --> 02:19:03,450
Hahaha!

3365
02:19:03,550 --> 02:19:05,370
It could be 42!

3366
02:19:06,110 --> 02:19:07,170
You're lucky!

3367
02:19:10,150 --> 02:19:11,870
Alright, where do I go?

3368
02:19:12,850 --> 02:19:14,130
Oh, it's 42.

3369
02:19:15,690 --> 02:19:16,210
It's 42!

3370
02:19:19,250 --> 02:19:20,290
Thank you!

3371
02:19:20,530 --> 02:19:21,730
Ba dum ba dum!

3372
02:19:21,870 --> 02:19:22,790
Ba dum ba dum!

3373
02:19:23,690 --> 02:19:24,190
Ba dum ba dum!

3374
02:19:24,190 --> 02:19:25,230
Ba dum ba dum!

3375
02:19:25,350 --> 02:19:28,610
Ba dum ba dum!

3376
02:19:31,770 --> 02:19:32,710
Alright, nice.

3377
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:34,890
Is this way?

3378
02:19:35,550 --> 02:19:38,130
Oh my god, it's actually 42.5?

3379
02:19:42,330 --> 02:19:43,590
Oh my god, it's actually 42.5?

3380
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:44,110
Oh my god, it's actually 42.5?

3381
02:19:44,110 --> 02:19:44,730
This is one of my favorite movies.

3382
02:19:45,730 --> 02:19:47,630
I wonder what happened to Martin Freeman.

3383
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:50,530
I swear.

3384
02:19:51,010 --> 02:19:51,490
Oh yeah!

3385
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:52,350
Marvel happened.

3386
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:55,390
So now he's not in any other good movies anymore.

3387
02:19:58,210 --> 02:19:58,930
Hahaha!

3388
02:20:01,870 --> 02:20:02,230
Hahaha!

3389
02:20:04,930 --> 02:20:06,830
He was in Marvel...

3390
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:12,550
Marvel is where actors go to retire.

3391
02:20:12,970 --> 02:20:13,410
Hahaha!

3392
02:20:14,490 --> 02:20:15,050
True!

3393
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:16,650
I don't know.

3394
02:20:16,770 --> 02:20:22,010
I feel like when you start getting Marvel parts, like, you just don't do anything else after that.

3395
02:20:22,610 --> 02:20:26,250
It's just, you're just a Marvel character now.

3396
02:20:29,730 --> 02:20:30,290
Alright.

3397
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:30,810
Whoa!

3398
02:20:31,010 --> 02:20:32,350
That's a big ass egg!

3399
02:20:32,750 --> 02:20:34,270
Is this gonna be a worm?

3400
02:20:35,790 --> 02:20:36,890
Wait, it's breathing.

3401
02:20:39,530 --> 02:20:40,750
Why is it breathing?

3402
02:20:41,410 --> 02:20:42,490
What the fuck?

3403
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:44,430
How did you get here?

3404
02:21:03,890 --> 02:21:05,630
Oh, are they consuming it?

3405
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:07,550
Do they also get stronger?

3406
02:21:14,110 --> 02:21:17,570
This is the weird thing about The way that they come out with the fire thing.

3407
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:20,790
The way that they come out with fire.

3408
02:21:23,710 --> 02:21:26,130
Are they using the fire thing?

3409
02:21:26,150 --> 02:21:34,550
Do they use fire?

3410
02:21:36,370 --> 02:21:42,450
Oh, I mean, Wait, I thought I was the only destined one.

3411
02:21:47,370 --> 02:21:49,490
He got corrupted.

3412
02:21:52,110 --> 02:21:53,290
Wait, isn't it me?

3413
02:21:56,210 --> 02:21:58,110
Wait, you were looking for me all along?

3414
02:21:59,670 --> 02:22:02,090
You could have helped me in Chapter 1!

3415
02:22:08,390 --> 02:22:12,290
Why does this big, beefy man get captured all the time?

3416
02:22:15,730 --> 02:22:17,410
Why can't I talk?

3417
02:22:18,570 --> 02:22:20,030
Why can't I just write...

3418
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:26,330
Okay, if I can't talk, why can't I just write on the sand and be like, I'm the destined one.

3419
02:22:26,570 --> 02:22:27,550
Can he not read?

3420
02:22:27,670 --> 02:22:28,490
Is he stupid?

3421
02:22:29,810 --> 02:22:31,530
Can I not write?

3422
02:22:31,570 --> 02:22:32,550
Am I stupid?

3423
02:22:34,890 --> 02:22:35,490
He's a hater.

3424
02:22:37,950 --> 02:22:40,370
And Vogue grows all muscle and no brain.

3425
02:22:43,450 --> 02:22:44,530
He's a monkey.

3426
02:22:44,690 --> 02:22:45,850
Of course he can't read.

3427
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:52,270
Am I illiterate?

3428
02:22:52,410 --> 02:22:54,470
Like, I know I am in real life, but like...

3429
02:22:54,470 --> 02:23:00,630
I thought in game I could be anybody I wanna be, and I wanna be a monkey that can read.

3430
02:23:00,630 --> 02:23:07,150
All I ever need!

3431
02:23:07,150 --> 02:23:09,010
How do I not know I'm the destined one?

3432
02:23:09,130 --> 02:23:10,410
Everybody says I'm...

3433
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:13,610
Literally, the first monkeys told me I'm the destined one!

3434
02:23:14,450 --> 02:23:17,450
How do I just somehow forgot I'm the destined one?

3435
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:23,310
Literally, that's literally what everybody keeps telling me.

3436
02:23:23,470 --> 02:23:24,990
They're like, you're the destined one.

3437
02:23:25,330 --> 02:23:27,070
Save Xun Hong...

3438
02:23:27,070 --> 02:23:29,790
You have to grab the fucking artifacts!

3439
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:46,370
Yeah, but I could just write, I could just write in the fucking sand, in the grass and be like, I'll just, I could use my fingers, whenever he says Zest in one, I point at myself, like, me?

3440
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:56,790
You know, like, man pointing at yourself emoji, like, I literally could just point at myself.

3441
02:24:00,770 --> 02:24:02,730
Okay, literally, this is what I could do.

3442
02:24:02,770 --> 02:24:03,510
Wait, is he dead?

3443
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:05,290
I want, okay, he's dead for real.

3444
02:24:05,370 --> 02:24:19,390
I was gonna tab out and he would be, like, still alive, like, man pointing at himself emoji.

3445
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:22,130
Wait, where is it?

3446
02:24:23,210 --> 02:24:25,630
I could just, okay, this is what I could do, guys.

3447
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:27,430
Every time...

3448
02:24:28,310 --> 02:24:29,770
Every time horseman...

3449
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:30,790
Is like...

3450
02:24:31,350 --> 02:24:34,870
Okay, let me make sure I draw correctly too.

3451
02:24:37,650 --> 02:24:43,230
Okay, the red strands are his hair, by the way, guys, if you guys need to know.

3452
02:24:43,330 --> 02:24:44,270
And then...

3453
02:24:47,300 --> 02:24:49,080
Okay, and then...

3454
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:49,740
Uh...

3455
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:50,500
Here we go.

3456
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:56,840
Guys, the red strands... Okay, let me make sure, I'm gonna erase the red strands and use black, because that would make more sense.

3457
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,660
Guys, the joke page is...

3458
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:04,820
The payoff is worth it, guys.

3459
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:09,360
Guys, the payoff for this joke is so worth it.

3460
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:10,080
Okay?

3461
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:12,800
It's up to my father to illustrate this.

3462
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:18,880
It'll be so worth it, I swear to God.

3463
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:21,840
I swear to God.

3464
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:24,880
The joke would be so worth it.

3465
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:26,300
Okay, there you go.

3466
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:27,640
So, every time...

3467
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:30,160
Every time...

3468
02:25:30,510 --> 02:25:32,940
Every time the horseman is like...

3469
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:35,580
Oh my God, I'm here to find the destined one.

3470
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:37,980
I could literally just be like...

3471
02:25:37,980 --> 02:25:38,500
Me?

3472
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:39,580
Like...

3473
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:46,960
That's all I have to do!

3474
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:48,740
They don't know!

3475
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:50,860
There it is!

3476
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:53,220
I could just be like...

3477
02:25:53,220 --> 02:25:53,720
Me?

3478
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,200
I told...

3479
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:01,060
I told...

3480
02:26:01,060 --> 02:26:01,800
That's his tail!

3481
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:04,120
I just forgot to draw it in red.

3482
02:26:04,440 --> 02:26:07,060
I just forgot to draw this in red.

3483
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:08,620
Um...

3484
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,500
DY, thank you for the super chat.

3485
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:11,880
Thank you.

3486
02:26:11,900 --> 02:26:12,560
Thank you.

3487
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:13,680
Hello from Rin.

3488
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:15,600
Thank you for the super chat.

3489
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:16,080
Thank you.

3490
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:16,800
Thank you.

3491
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
I just...

3492
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:20,800
Guys...

3493
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:24,300
I didn't have a lot of time to do this artwork.

3494
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:29,580
Like, you understand the joke?

3495
02:26:29,580 --> 02:26:30,020
Okay!

3496
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:35,200
As long as you understand the joke.

3497
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:38,720
Nice and intelligent.

3498
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:40,160
Keep it.

3499
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:41,980
That's fucked.

3500
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:44,460
Alright.

3501
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:46,800
Nice.

3502
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:47,120
Alright.

3503
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:48,760
Got another...

3504
02:26:49,140 --> 02:26:50,200
Another worm.

3505
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:52,420
Wait, is there something here?

3506
02:26:52,740 --> 02:26:53,480
Oh, it's just...

3507
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:54,020
Gatter.

3508
02:26:54,220 --> 02:26:55,720
Oh, it's just Jade Lotus.

3509
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:57,560
Okay.

3510
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:58,000
Okay.

3511
02:26:59,580 --> 02:27:02,560
Look, I needed the visuals to explain my joke better.

3512
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:05,460
So that you guys will think I'm funny.

3513
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:10,770
Bye bye, worm.

3514
02:27:11,350 --> 02:27:12,030
Bye bye.

3515
02:27:13,850 --> 02:27:15,710
So many fucking worms.

3516
02:27:18,310 --> 02:27:19,730
At least they're like super...

3517
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:21,070
They're just super tanky.

3518
02:27:21,090 --> 02:27:23,110
But they're so annoying to fight.

3519
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:25,170
Because they're so tanky.

3520
02:27:25,310 --> 02:27:25,810
Like...

3521
02:27:25,810 --> 02:27:26,490
Oh, no!

3522
02:27:28,650 --> 02:27:30,450
I'm sorry for calling you easy.

3523
02:27:31,130 --> 02:27:33,830
You're the only exception, baby girl.

3524
02:27:34,030 --> 02:27:34,950
Baby worm.

3525
02:27:36,390 --> 02:27:38,530
I didn't mean that, baby worm.

3526
02:27:38,650 --> 02:27:39,410
You're not easy.

3527
02:27:42,830 --> 02:27:44,070
The karma.

3528
02:27:46,330 --> 02:27:47,130
Don't worry.

3529
02:27:47,330 --> 02:27:48,050
I got him.

3530
02:27:49,430 --> 02:27:50,050
Alright.

3531
02:27:51,130 --> 02:27:52,330
I told you.

3532
02:27:52,390 --> 02:27:53,450
So fucking easy.

3533
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:56,710
I don't like the little...

3534
02:27:56,710 --> 02:27:57,750
Nubby face.

3535
02:27:58,450 --> 02:27:59,770
It's a fucking worm!

3536
02:27:59,770 --> 02:28:00,870
What do you even want?

3537
02:28:01,130 --> 02:28:01,930
You want...

3538
02:28:01,930 --> 02:28:02,890
Okay, if...

3539
02:28:02,890 --> 02:28:03,570
Okay, more...

3540
02:28:03,570 --> 02:28:04,810
It's more like a caterpillar.

3541
02:28:04,890 --> 02:28:09,290
If you want a caterpillar to have long ass legs, that's even more freaky.

3542
02:28:09,610 --> 02:28:13,130
Like, I don't think you'd like a caterpillar with long ass fucking legs.

3543
02:28:14,570 --> 02:28:15,910
That shit is freaky.

3544
02:28:17,390 --> 02:28:18,110
Oh, hey.

3545
02:28:18,170 --> 02:28:19,070
That's another shrine.

3546
02:28:21,950 --> 02:28:22,710
Oh, shit.

3547
02:28:23,730 --> 02:28:24,450
Oh, dear.

3548
02:28:24,910 --> 02:28:25,910
No flat zone!

3549
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:27,490
What did I tell you?

3550
02:28:28,750 --> 02:28:30,770
Got to teach you that lesson again, old man.

3551
02:28:32,430 --> 02:28:33,050
Oh, shit.

3552
02:28:33,630 --> 02:28:34,290
Oh, shit.

3553
02:28:34,530 --> 02:28:36,270
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3554
02:28:36,510 --> 02:28:37,650
I can't be relatable.

3555
02:28:37,770 --> 02:28:39,010
I can't die to the mobs.

3556
02:28:43,830 --> 02:28:44,270
Alright.

3557
02:28:45,550 --> 02:28:46,690
I'll just grab this chest.

3558
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:51,160
What did I get?

3559
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:53,720
Okay, refined iron sand.

3560
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,400
Alright, I can just literally ignore them.

3561
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:00,600
Alright.

3562
02:29:03,850 --> 02:29:05,450
And thank you for the super chat.

3563
02:29:05,490 --> 02:29:05,830
Thank you.

3564
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:06,490
Thank you.

3565
02:29:06,550 --> 02:29:07,870
Tell everyone I love them.

3566
02:29:07,950 --> 02:29:11,890
I hope you're all having fun, especially those drinking a Baja Blast with cheese.

3567
02:29:11,970 --> 02:29:13,890
Is this like an advertisement from Burger King?

3568
02:29:14,610 --> 02:29:16,610
Thank you for the super chat.

3569
02:29:16,730 --> 02:29:17,330
Thank you.

3570
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:19,530
You guys know Burger King used to do...

3571
02:29:19,530 --> 02:29:20,990
Like, not Burger King.

3572
02:29:21,070 --> 02:29:21,610
I don't remember.

3573
02:29:22,450 --> 02:29:23,710
Corporations on Twitch.

3574
02:29:24,970 --> 02:29:25,850
So, like...

3575
02:29:25,850 --> 02:29:29,290
Okay, so I don't know if corporations still do this.

3576
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:30,690
But, like...

3577
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:31,110
Um...

3578
02:29:31,450 --> 02:29:31,710
Back...

3579
02:29:31,710 --> 02:29:32,030
I don't...

3580
02:29:32,030 --> 02:29:33,190
Back then, like...

3581
02:29:33,190 --> 02:29:33,550
Uh...

3582
02:29:33,550 --> 02:29:35,650
Like, I think for, like, two or three years ago.

3583
02:29:35,930 --> 02:29:37,350
Or maybe, like, even, like...

3584
02:29:37,350 --> 02:29:38,350
Still today.

3585
02:29:38,550 --> 02:29:39,690
When you see corporations...

3586
02:29:41,050 --> 02:29:41,570
Uh...

3587
02:29:41,570 --> 02:29:41,830
Corporations...

3588
02:29:42,430 --> 02:29:42,950
Oh, sorry.

3589
02:29:43,070 --> 02:29:43,590
Taco Bell.

3590
02:29:43,730 --> 02:29:45,470
I've never had a Baja Blast, guys.

3591
02:29:47,250 --> 02:29:48,290
I've never...

3592
02:29:48,810 --> 02:29:51,170
Guys, I've never had a Baja Blast.

3593
02:29:51,390 --> 02:29:51,910
I...

3594
02:29:51,910 --> 02:29:54,430
I just assumed it was from Burger King.

3595
02:29:57,010 --> 02:29:57,530
Anyway.

3596
02:29:57,810 --> 02:29:59,930
So, like, when corporations...

3597
02:29:59,930 --> 02:30:00,570
Um...

3598
02:30:00,570 --> 02:30:00,670
Um...

3599
02:30:00,690 --> 02:30:02,670
On Twitch, GIF, like...

3600
02:30:02,670 --> 02:30:03,430
Um...

3601
02:30:03,430 --> 02:30:04,090
Sub...

3602
02:30:04,090 --> 02:30:04,410
Sorry.

3603
02:30:04,490 --> 02:30:06,230
I keep forgetting that on Twitch it's subscribers.

3604
02:30:06,570 --> 02:30:11,470
So, like, for those who don't know, on Twitch, memberships on YouTube is, like, subscribers on Twitch.

3605
02:30:11,950 --> 02:30:12,510
Um...

3606
02:30:12,510 --> 02:30:17,950
And when corporations, uh, gift, like, subscriptions on Twitch, it's an...

3607
02:30:17,950 --> 02:30:23,910
It's easier advertisement versus, like, sponsoring a streamer.

3608
02:30:25,450 --> 02:30:30,830
Because when you used to gift subscription, it, like, shows up that you, like, gifted a lot.

3609
02:30:30,910 --> 02:30:34,010
Like, you show up on the very top being, like, most gifted.

3610
02:30:34,230 --> 02:30:42,310
So then you show up on, like, big channels and, uh, you show up on big channels, um, with your, like, name of your corporation and stuff.

3611
02:30:42,490 --> 02:30:48,490
So that's why you would see, like, big companies, like, gift big streamers lots and lots of subscription.

3612
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:52,730
Because it's, like, a billboard ad and it's a lot cheaper, um...

3613
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:57,450
It's a lot cheaper than, uh, uh, than paying the streamer.

3614
02:30:57,670 --> 02:30:58,070
Uh...

3615
02:30:58,650 --> 02:31:00,210
I don't know if they still do.

3616
02:31:00,210 --> 02:31:00,450
I don't know if they still do that.

3617
02:31:00,730 --> 02:31:01,130
Like...

3618
02:31:04,730 --> 02:31:05,490
That's sneaky.

3619
02:31:05,670 --> 02:31:06,150
It is.

3620
02:31:06,170 --> 02:31:06,850
It's very sneaky.

3621
02:31:08,190 --> 02:31:09,910
I don't know if I'm supposed to go down here.

3622
02:31:10,810 --> 02:31:12,670
I don't think I was supposed to go down...

3623
02:31:12,670 --> 02:31:14,170
There's so much HP!

3624
02:31:15,130 --> 02:31:16,690
Like, what the fuck?

3625
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:25,210
Oh, wait, no.

3626
02:31:25,250 --> 02:31:26,230
This was, like, the beginning.

3627
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:31,780
The army used to run Twitch ads.

3628
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:34,040
Not in America, so, like, it's not targ...

3629
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:35,200
I don't get the targeted ads.

3630
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:41,240
No, because you show...

3631
02:31:41,240 --> 02:31:42,100
Because on Twitch, it's...

3632
02:31:42,100 --> 02:31:43,480
You show up on...

3633
02:31:44,140 --> 02:31:44,660
Um...

3634
02:31:44,660 --> 02:31:45,980
You show up at the...

3635
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:46,580
Why did it...

3636
02:31:46,580 --> 02:31:48,140
Oh, this left!

3637
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:49,660
Wait, there's nothing here.

3638
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:50,980
What?

3639
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:51,700
Why did...

3640
02:31:51,700 --> 02:31:53,560
Who told me to go left?!

3641
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:56,820
Did you tell me to go left because you wanted me to fall?!

3642
02:31:57,420 --> 02:31:58,320
That's fucked.

3643
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:01,340
That's so fucked.

3644
02:32:02,360 --> 02:32:03,280
Like, where...

3645
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:04,220
What is that?

3646
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:05,220
There's nothing there!

3647
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:06,540
This is the beginning!

3648
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:07,480
I don't know.

3649
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:08,180
I don't know.

3650
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:09,760
Yes.

3651
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:12,760
That's so fucked.

3652
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:13,360
Wait.

3653
02:32:15,460 --> 02:32:16,560
What's that hand holding?

3654
02:32:19,360 --> 02:32:19,880
Oh.

3655
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:21,380
I don't know.

3656
02:32:21,460 --> 02:32:23,380
This is, like, Stranger Danger right there.

3657
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:24,820
It's like, hey.

3658
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:26,180
Hey, little monkey.

3659
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:28,340
You want some candy?

3660
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:30,780
Guys, do I take the candy?

3661
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:31,620
Like...

3662
02:32:36,260 --> 02:32:38,160
There's surely nothing back there.

3663
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:40,540
That will happen if I take the mysterious...

3664
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:41,460
Oh!

3665
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:42,400
It's the mirror!

3666
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:42,740
Oh!

3667
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:45,040
Wow.

3668
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:46,400
I can't believe it.

3669
02:32:46,420 --> 02:32:47,540
Something bad happened.

3670
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:50,960
Oh, shit!

3671
02:32:53,060 --> 02:32:54,600
Who would've thought?

3672
02:32:56,140 --> 02:32:58,640
That hand is actually bad hand.

3673
02:32:59,700 --> 02:33:00,380
Damn.

3674
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:04,120
Biggest plot twist of my life.

3675
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:06,720
Oh, shit!

3676
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:07,560
Oh, shit!

3677
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:07,680
Oh, shit!

3678
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:10,440
As if things would actually be this easy.

3679
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,120
How is that the Buddha's right hand?

3680
02:33:13,380 --> 02:33:14,760
What the fuck?

3681
02:33:14,980 --> 02:33:15,400
You're...

3682
02:33:15,400 --> 02:33:15,880
Okay.

3683
02:33:16,300 --> 02:33:16,780
Bro.

3684
02:33:16,900 --> 02:33:18,940
How is this hand so hard to kill?

3685
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:21,100
Okay.

3686
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:22,480
This hand is pissing me off.

3687
02:33:24,100 --> 02:33:26,500
Am I gonna be able to use the combo at all?

3688
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:29,820
Oh, my God.

3689
02:33:29,860 --> 02:33:30,040
Okay.

3690
02:33:30,140 --> 02:33:30,580
Thank God.

3691
02:33:30,620 --> 02:33:30,800
Okay.

3692
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:32,320
Jesus Christ!

3693
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:33,460
Fucking stupid hand!

3694
02:33:36,580 --> 02:33:37,060
Bro!

3695
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:37,940
He's fucking...

3696
02:33:37,940 --> 02:33:38,140
Bro!

3697
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:40,940
I'm going back up before I can do a combo!

3698
02:33:42,060 --> 02:33:43,060
This is bullshit!

3699
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:43,320
No!

3700
02:33:44,820 --> 02:33:45,320
Oh!

3701
02:33:45,400 --> 02:33:46,500
I can't figure out this combo!

3702
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:51,840
He's just moving like a hand!

3703
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:53,800
Wait.

3704
02:33:53,940 --> 02:33:54,540
Oh, my God.

3705
02:33:54,560 --> 02:33:54,700
Wait.

3706
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:55,440
What the fuck?

3707
02:33:57,340 --> 02:33:59,480
What the fuck is that?

3708
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:02,160
What's going on?

3709
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:05,100
Wait.

3710
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:05,440
What?

3711
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:08,040
I am so...

3712
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:08,800
I am so confused.

3713
02:34:09,440 --> 02:34:09,980
Like...

3714
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:11,560
I am so confused.

3715
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:12,300
That is not a hand.

3716
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:13,460
That was not a hand.

3717
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:14,120
It was just bait.

3718
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:17,640
Imagine losing...

3719
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:19,480
Losing to a hand.

3720
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:21,020
Okay.

3721
02:34:21,020 --> 02:34:21,340
Nice.

3722
02:34:22,660 --> 02:34:24,740
Oh, that guy confused the shit out of me.

3723
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:26,540
First try!

3724
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:30,640
Wait.

3725
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:31,540
Did I die?

3726
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:34,100
Wait.

3727
02:34:35,140 --> 02:34:36,220
What was that?

3728
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:37,480
What was that?

3729
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:38,140
I'm gonna die.

3730
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:38,300
I'm alive.

3731
02:34:38,600 --> 02:34:39,100
Okay.

3732
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,900
It was his tail?

3733
02:34:52,380 --> 02:34:53,280
Oh, my God.

3734
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:53,940
It was.

3735
02:34:55,220 --> 02:34:56,580
It's not even a hand.

3736
02:35:10,360 --> 02:35:11,780
Hot goth lady.

3737
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:15,080
Hot goth spider lady.

3738
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:18,640
Wait.

3739
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:20,460
Are you serious?

3740
02:35:20,940 --> 02:35:21,060
Wait.

3741
02:35:21,060 --> 02:35:23,200
Wait, I didn't even ask for your help.

3742
02:35:24,140 --> 02:35:27,720
He's like, I will no longer help you now.

3743
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:29,920
It's like, well, I never asked for it.

3744
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:31,260
Like, you just showed up.

3745
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:34,940
Oh no, go outside.

3746
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:38,760
What's stopping you?

3747
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:43,580
Literally nothing's stopping you from going outside.

3748
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:46,580
Greg, thank you for the super chat.

3749
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:47,440
Thank you, thank you.

3750
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:48,780
Need a hand with that?

3751
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:52,080
Alright, nice.

3752
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:53,220
Her mom.

3753
02:35:53,620 --> 02:35:55,180
Bro, what the fuck is her mom gonna do?

3754
02:35:57,420 --> 02:35:58,740
Like, kill her?

3755
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:04,060
Bro, she has so many kids.

3756
02:36:04,940 --> 02:36:08,140
You're literally not the only hot spider lady.

3757
02:36:10,260 --> 02:36:11,940
She has so many children.

3758
02:36:12,060 --> 02:36:13,240
She's not gonna notice.

3759
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:16,580
Just leave.

3760
02:36:21,350 --> 02:36:22,370
Alright, nice.

3761
02:36:22,430 --> 02:36:23,230
Maximum mana.

3762
02:36:23,390 --> 02:36:24,030
We need that.

3763
02:36:25,430 --> 02:36:26,510
Now you go.

3764
02:36:26,590 --> 02:36:27,790
Okay, I went left, guys.

3765
02:36:32,790 --> 02:36:35,050
Now you go left, Doki.

3766
02:36:36,330 --> 02:36:38,430
Is he actually the Buddha's hand?

3767
02:36:38,670 --> 02:36:39,550
Or is that bait?

3768
02:36:40,470 --> 02:36:41,430
There's no way.

3769
02:36:43,390 --> 02:36:44,630
Let's just double check.

3770
02:36:44,810 --> 02:36:45,970
Oh, do I have a new relic?

3771
02:36:46,030 --> 02:36:46,370
Whoa!

3772
02:36:46,670 --> 02:36:48,870
Okay, that's a lot of new relics.

3773
02:36:49,670 --> 02:36:50,990
Increases poison resistance.

3774
02:36:51,930 --> 02:36:53,850
Moderately increases poison damage.

3775
02:36:55,650 --> 02:36:57,150
Considerably increases defense.

3776
02:36:57,310 --> 02:37:00,050
Deals damage to surrounding enemies upon taking a hit.

3777
02:37:00,150 --> 02:37:00,410
Oh, wait.

3778
02:37:00,430 --> 02:37:00,990
What do I have?

3779
02:37:01,370 --> 02:37:02,450
Okay, critical hit.

3780
02:37:03,470 --> 02:37:04,010
Linus.

3781
02:37:04,190 --> 02:37:04,650
Okay.

3782
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:05,450
What's this?

3783
02:37:05,830 --> 02:37:06,370
Slightly...

3784
02:37:06,370 --> 02:37:07,010
Oh, okay.

3785
02:37:07,090 --> 02:37:07,870
I don't need this then.

3786
02:37:08,570 --> 02:37:09,110
Um...

3787
02:37:10,970 --> 02:37:13,130
I guess I'll get this, the defense.

3788
02:37:14,710 --> 02:37:15,250
Um...

3789
02:37:16,090 --> 02:37:17,990
I wanna see...

3790
02:37:19,530 --> 02:37:20,070
What?

3791
02:37:20,350 --> 02:37:20,890
Wait.

3792
02:37:21,790 --> 02:37:22,330
Equipment.

3793
02:37:22,350 --> 02:37:23,010
Do I have another gourd?

3794
02:37:24,970 --> 02:37:29,070
Amount of burn resistance and immunity from lava-covered terrain.

3795
02:37:30,230 --> 02:37:35,050
Each sip contains 36% of maximum health.

3796
02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:38,630
Oh, wait.

3797
02:37:38,710 --> 02:37:39,170
This is eight.

3798
02:37:39,450 --> 02:37:40,150
Wait, what the fuck?

3799
02:37:40,170 --> 02:37:41,030
Why do I even read that?

3800
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:44,250
Why do I even need to read that?

3801
02:37:44,830 --> 02:37:45,570
That's eight.

3802
02:37:45,750 --> 02:37:47,010
Eight is more than...

3803
02:37:47,010 --> 02:37:48,370
Eight is more than seven.

3804
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:52,890
Okay, I wanna see what the Buddha right hand looks like.

3805
02:37:56,440 --> 02:37:56,840
Alright.

3806
02:37:57,920 --> 02:38:01,360
The hand that plucked the lotus of the saint, yet not from the same egg.

3807
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:04,700
Who in the olden days... Is he actually the Buddha's right hand?

3808
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:08,480
Wait, he's left-handed?

3809
02:38:09,400 --> 02:38:10,060
Oh, no!

3810
02:38:10,100 --> 02:38:10,940
He has a brother!

3811
02:38:11,620 --> 02:38:13,640
I was gonna be like, wait, he's left-handed?

3812
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:14,600
Then this is bait!

3813
02:38:15,080 --> 02:38:15,760
This is...

3814
02:38:17,660 --> 02:38:19,900
I was like, wait, there's no way...

3815
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:20,740
Sorry, I was speed reading.

3816
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:24,360
Oh, okay.

3817
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:25,800
Oh, so he has a twin!

3818
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:30,740
He has a twin!

3819
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:36,380
I was gonna be like, what the fuck?

3820
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:37,780
You're actually...

3821
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:40,800
You're left-handed, but they call you right-hand Bill.

3822
02:38:45,610 --> 02:38:46,930
Alright, let's see.

3823
02:38:50,430 --> 02:38:51,930
I guess we go this way.

3824
02:38:58,280 --> 02:38:59,880
Oh, there's two ways.

3825
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:02,020
Which way do we go?

3826
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:04,680
Do we go left or right, chat?

3827
02:39:05,980 --> 02:39:06,740
Left side?

3828
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:07,540
Okay.

3829
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:09,040
I'll go left.

3830
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:11,580
There's a mysterious bridge.

3831
02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:13,200
Hey, that's nice!

3832
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:14,940
The spiders know how to build bridges!

3833
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:17,960
Where's the Buddha?

3834
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:19,120
Of course.

3835
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:21,280
Oh.

3836
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:22,960
Oh.

3837
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:26,900
That's nice of them, being able to build bridges.

3838
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:30,380
These guys are so easy to kill.

3839
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:32,700
They're like babies.

3840
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:35,880
But they give me 105, which is nice.

3841
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:39,000
I like it when babies give 105.

3842
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:40,640
Get your head over here.

3843
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:43,660
And they don't fight back, too.

3844
02:39:44,140 --> 02:39:45,880
Like actual babies.

3845
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:49,200
Alright, nice.

3846
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:49,980
Chest time.

3847
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:52,020
Chest time.

3848
02:39:59,010 --> 02:39:59,370
Yay!

3849
02:39:59,970 --> 02:40:00,690
Guys!

3850
02:40:01,030 --> 02:40:03,870
Guys, I finally have more iron leaves!

3851
02:40:04,510 --> 02:40:05,750
It's your favorite!

3852
02:40:09,030 --> 02:40:10,250
Wait, that's a lot.

3853
02:40:11,230 --> 02:40:12,450
Oh, no.

3854
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:15,150
Wait a minute.

3855
02:40:15,330 --> 02:40:16,950
Can they whack me?

3856
02:40:17,490 --> 02:40:18,570
Wait a...

3857
02:40:21,050 --> 02:40:21,770
Guys.

3858
02:40:23,010 --> 02:40:25,870
I have a feeling they're about to whack me.

3859
02:40:26,810 --> 02:40:27,510
It's fine.

3860
02:40:27,630 --> 02:40:29,770
If I whack them first, they can't whack me.

3861
02:40:30,650 --> 02:40:32,190
Let's get rid of all of them here.

3862
02:40:34,470 --> 02:40:34,990
No!

3863
02:40:35,970 --> 02:40:37,270
I wanna whack!

3864
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:41,860
You can't tell me what to do!

3865
02:40:42,880 --> 02:40:43,400
Whack!

3866
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:47,140
I shall whack them all!

3867
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:49,900
Whack!

3868
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:52,020
What are they gonna do, kill me?

3869
02:40:52,600 --> 02:40:54,920
I can't even...

3870
02:40:58,250 --> 02:40:59,050
Still alive.

3871
02:41:04,830 --> 02:41:06,310
This is so...

3872
02:41:06,310 --> 02:41:09,310
I'm just going to fall off...

3873
02:41:12,370 --> 02:41:13,830
As I was sitting...

3874
02:41:13,830 --> 02:41:13,970
No!

3875
02:41:14,270 --> 02:41:15,490
Let me back up!

3876
02:41:16,050 --> 02:41:16,730
No!

3877
02:41:17,470 --> 02:41:19,130
No, I got a bug!

3878
02:41:19,730 --> 02:41:22,090
There's an invisible, there's an actual.

3879
02:41:22,610 --> 02:41:24,610
There's an- There's,

3880
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:30,180
there's an...

3881
02:41:30,180 --> 02:41:30,780
But there's an actual...

3882
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:32,680
Actual invisible wall!

3883
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:38,300
There I go!

3884
02:41:38,540 --> 02:41:39,800
Okay, guys.

3885
02:41:40,020 --> 02:41:41,440
I found...

3886
02:41:41,440 --> 02:41:44,180
Guys, I found out that...

3887
02:41:44,480 --> 02:41:46,300
Guys, I don't know if you know this.

3888
02:41:46,580 --> 02:41:47,160
But...

3889
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:49,940
But you can actually fall.

3890
02:41:50,340 --> 02:41:53,280
You can actually fall there.

3891
02:41:53,780 --> 02:41:54,660
That's...

3892
02:41:54,660 --> 02:41:58,720
That's good to know.

3893
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:01,960
Okay.

3894
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:06,140
But the prison level taught me that I couldn't fall!

3895
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:08,780
Why can't I fall now?

3896
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:11,380
It doesn't make any sense.

3897
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:15,720
In the prison level, I could just walk wherever I wanted.

3898
02:42:18,340 --> 02:42:19,780
So relatable.

3899
02:42:20,860 --> 02:42:21,580
Okay.

3900
02:42:21,880 --> 02:42:23,340
Alright, now I know.

3901
02:42:23,800 --> 02:42:26,040
Okay, I'll use cloud step now.

3902
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:28,720
I'll use cloud step.

3903
02:42:30,820 --> 02:42:31,420
Alright.

3904
02:42:32,700 --> 02:42:36,680
Alright, now I know why everyone kept telling me to use cloud step.

3905
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:39,000
Now I know.

3906
02:42:41,460 --> 02:42:42,060
Alright.

3907
02:42:42,920 --> 02:42:44,800
This time it'll be different.

3908
02:42:46,540 --> 02:42:47,980
Alright, get rid of these guys first.

3909
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:49,940
Get rid of the babies.

3910
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:51,900
Get out of here, babies!

3911
02:42:53,740 --> 02:42:55,540
You don't deserve to be here.

3912
02:42:56,780 --> 02:42:58,400
Be gone, babies!

3913
02:42:58,620 --> 02:42:59,500
Be gone!

3914
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:02,400
Alright, nice.

3915
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:04,080
Alright.

3916
02:43:04,880 --> 02:43:11,780
Okay, now that I know that I can just walk through here as a little cloud.

3917
02:43:12,300 --> 02:43:13,140
Oh, absorb!

3918
02:43:14,340 --> 02:43:15,460
Oh hey, that was easy.

3919
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:17,820
Hey, that was easy.

3920
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:22,660
Wow, that was so easy.

3921
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:26,040
Alright, nice.

3922
02:43:29,780 --> 02:43:30,600
Let's go this way.

3923
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:31,800
Oh, it's the moth guy!

3924
02:43:34,460 --> 02:43:35,540
Wait, this is bad.

3925
02:43:35,620 --> 02:43:37,480
I can't afford the...

3926
02:43:38,460 --> 02:43:40,060
I don't have the...

3927
02:43:40,060 --> 02:43:43,360
Wait, I could swap wards to recover my mana, actually.

3928
02:43:43,780 --> 02:43:48,340
I was gonna say, this is bad because I have no magic technically.

3929
02:43:48,680 --> 02:43:50,900
Or my magic is super fucking weak.

3930
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:52,960
Oh, unlucky.

3931
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:54,560
It's fine.

3932
02:43:54,860 --> 02:43:55,180
Whoa!

3933
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:56,620
That's fine.

3934
02:43:57,900 --> 02:43:58,580
Nice.

3935
02:43:58,880 --> 02:44:02,000
What if the sack have iron leaves, Doki?

3936
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:03,960
Think about the iron leaves!

3937
02:44:06,020 --> 02:44:09,100
You could have 45 iron leaves, Doki!

3938
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:10,460
Think about it!

3939
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:15,480
Oh yeah, I didn't see this guy.

3940
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:17,920
Okay, what if like... I'm gonna...

3941
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:20,780
Where's that thing that increases mana?

3942
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,560
Uh, increases speed...

3943
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:28,520
Oh, I have... God, I have to do it at the incense.

3944
02:44:28,680 --> 02:44:29,180
I forgot.

3945
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:30,660
It's at the incense area.

3946
02:44:32,420 --> 02:44:32,740
Yeah.

3947
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:35,180
I have to do it at the incense.

3948
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:37,440
Yeah.

3949
02:44:38,780 --> 02:44:39,340
I forgot.

3950
02:44:39,380 --> 02:44:41,540
That's the only way to change these thingies.

3951
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:45,100
Oh, thank god he hit the tree.

3952
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:45,580
He missed.

3953
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,080
Don't worry, echolocation!

3954
02:44:53,400 --> 02:44:53,720
Echolocated!

3955
02:44:56,040 --> 02:44:56,940
It's that easy.

3956
02:44:58,240 --> 02:44:58,880
Poke!

3957
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:01,940
Where is it?

3958
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:02,720
There he is!

3959
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:05,100
There he is!

3960
02:45:06,980 --> 02:45:07,620
Echolocation!

3961
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:10,160
Echolocation!

3962
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:14,420
Now, like, when people ask you, why does she laugh so much?

3963
02:45:14,780 --> 02:45:16,120
It's her form of...

3964
02:45:16,120 --> 02:45:17,660
It's her form of direction.

3965
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:19,420
Of a compass.

3966
02:45:22,480 --> 02:45:23,540
Alright, nice.

3967
02:45:27,800 --> 02:45:28,420
Alright, leaves.

3968
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:29,120
Oh!

3969
02:45:29,900 --> 02:45:30,380
Nice.

3970
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:31,340
We need that.

3971
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:32,180
That's the material.

3972
02:45:34,660 --> 02:45:35,140
Uh...

3973
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:37,340
Which way?

3974
02:45:37,380 --> 02:45:37,700
This way.

3975
02:45:39,700 --> 02:45:40,680
Hey, there's Mountain.

3976
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:41,280
He's here.

3977
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:44,160
Why would that hot spider lady...

3978
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:44,800
Oh my god.

3979
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:45,580
God damn it.

3980
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:46,900
Oh.

3981
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:49,020
I was gonna say I faced the wrong way.

3982
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:50,360
Holy shit!

3983
02:45:50,380 --> 02:45:51,160
What a propeller!

3984
02:45:54,320 --> 02:45:54,800
Okay.

3985
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:57,240
Guess we go this way.

3986
02:45:59,880 --> 02:46:03,300
Oh, I should've not wasted my power up there.

3987
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:05,420
The heavy attack there.

3988
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:09,760
Cause I could've used it on this guy.

3989
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:11,920
This guy is a bigger threat!

3990
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:14,240
Jesus!

3991
02:46:14,380 --> 02:46:14,680
Fuck!

3992
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:15,820
God damn it.

3993
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:17,320
Alright.

3994
02:46:17,440 --> 02:46:18,020
It's fine.

3995
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:18,880
I'm okay.

3996
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:20,760
I'm okay.

3997
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:21,960
I'm not okay.

3998
02:46:22,460 --> 02:46:23,240
I'm okay.

3999
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:25,640
I'm not okay.

4000
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:26,320
JK!

4001
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:26,800
JK!

4002
02:46:29,020 --> 02:46:29,620
It's alright.

4003
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:31,180
It's okay.

4004
02:46:31,300 --> 02:46:32,040
I don't wanna be relatable.

4005
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:37,980
If I don't die to a normal mob, I'll never be relatable.

4006
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:40,500
Cause I'm Virtua.

4007
02:46:40,980 --> 02:46:42,360
Where the fuck is it?

4008
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:45,560
Wait.

4009
02:46:45,560 --> 02:46:46,420
Where's the incense?

4010
02:46:48,900 --> 02:46:49,880
Oh, it's this way.

4011
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:51,840
What?

4012
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:52,900
No, it's not.

4013
02:46:54,980 --> 02:46:56,140
Oh, it's over here.

4014
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:57,900
The thing that's covered in all the smoke.

4015
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:01,080
There it is.

4016
02:47:04,840 --> 02:47:06,620
She's too quick at this.

4017
02:47:07,440 --> 02:47:08,320
Alright, rest.

4018
02:47:09,740 --> 02:47:10,560
Okay, that's good.

4019
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:12,500
I don't have to change the silks then.

4020
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:14,180
There's a new one?

4021
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:17,520
Increases maximum... Oh!

4022
02:47:17,820 --> 02:47:18,580
Wait, that's good.

4023
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:20,360
Who needs poison?

4024
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:24,340
Yeah, that's good.

4025
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:29,300
Like, I know this entire world is based off of poison.

4026
02:47:29,500 --> 02:47:30,720
But like, who needs...

4027
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:34,520
I just think like we don't...

4028
02:47:36,340 --> 02:47:37,360
I'll get better.

4029
02:47:39,420 --> 02:47:40,380
I'll just recover.

4030
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:41,060
It's okay.

4031
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:45,180
Guys, I can just...

4032
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:46,320
I can fix myself.

4033
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:48,760
Alright, nice.

4034
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:51,600
Poke!

4035
02:47:52,660 --> 02:47:53,140
Jesus.

4036
02:47:53,360 --> 02:47:54,800
That's so much damage.

4037
02:47:55,940 --> 02:47:56,760
God damn it!

4038
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:58,080
Okay.

4039
02:47:58,660 --> 02:48:00,620
These beetles are so annoying!

4040
02:48:01,220 --> 02:48:02,440
For a regular mob!

4041
02:48:04,360 --> 02:48:04,840
Alright.

4042
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:06,980
Oh my god.

4043
02:48:07,020 --> 02:48:08,480
They give me like $600?

4044
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:10,360
Okay, yeah.

4045
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:10,960
No wonder.

4046
02:48:11,180 --> 02:48:12,900
These guys are so fucking...

4047
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:14,020
Wait, wrong way?

4048
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:15,340
Which way do I go?

4049
02:48:21,010 --> 02:48:21,690
This way?

4050
02:48:21,690 --> 02:48:21,870
This way?

4051
02:48:22,930 --> 02:48:23,990
Go back to the shrine?

4052
02:48:25,150 --> 02:48:26,970
Is this an optional boss over there?

4053
02:48:36,830 --> 02:48:38,070
Okay, I'm gonna rest up then.

4054
02:48:40,150 --> 02:48:41,910
I was like, is this an optional boss?

4055
02:48:42,210 --> 02:48:42,970
And someone's like, yeah.

4056
02:48:43,090 --> 02:48:44,050
And the other person's like, no.

4057
02:48:46,470 --> 02:48:47,190
Oh, cutscene?

4058
02:48:48,310 --> 02:48:48,770
Who's he?

4059
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:03,600
Guys, I'm not lagging.

4060
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:05,080
It's the hot goth lady.

4061
02:49:05,300 --> 02:49:05,900
Spider lady.

4062
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:10,000
The hot spider goth lady has too many polygons.

4063
02:49:10,580 --> 02:49:11,700
Oh no.

4064
02:49:12,300 --> 02:49:13,540
Oh no.

4065
02:49:13,560 --> 02:49:15,060
Oh no.

4066
02:49:18,660 --> 02:49:20,020
Oh no.

4067
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:23,580
Oh no.

4068
02:49:23,580 --> 02:49:24,180
I didn't kill anybody!

4069
02:49:25,460 --> 02:49:26,000
Oh!

4070
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:28,080
Wait, you're a...

4071
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:30,020
Okay, I killed all your brothers and sisters.

4072
02:49:35,300 --> 02:49:36,740
Never mind.

4073
02:49:46,840 --> 02:49:48,280
Never mind.

4074
02:49:53,580 --> 02:49:54,720
I fucked up!

4075
02:49:57,200 --> 02:49:58,900
Okay, I already fucked...

4076
02:49:58,900 --> 02:50:00,640
It's okay, I want it to be relatable.

4077
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:02,400
That's why.

4078
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:04,640
I wanted...

4079
02:50:04,640 --> 02:50:06,560
I fucked up.

4080
02:50:06,880 --> 02:50:08,400
He interrupted me.

4081
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:10,560
It's okay.

4082
02:50:12,620 --> 02:50:14,800
Wait, does this use magic?

4083
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:16,680
It doesn't, right?

4084
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:18,800
Okay.

4085
02:50:19,540 --> 02:50:20,500
Come on, please!

4086
02:50:20,640 --> 02:50:21,840
Let me use one move!

4087
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:26,120
Oh my god, I haven't used this in so long.

4088
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:28,160
Okay, nice.

4089
02:50:28,280 --> 02:50:28,920
Okay, it does it.

4090
02:50:28,980 --> 02:50:29,860
So I'm fine.

4091
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:31,140
Oh no.

4092
02:50:31,980 --> 02:50:33,940
Oh no, I think this is over.

4093
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:36,140
I'm not gonna be relatable.

4094
02:50:36,820 --> 02:50:39,400
No, I have to be relatable!

4095
02:50:44,340 --> 02:50:47,480
The moment he interrupted the first attack.

4096
02:50:48,340 --> 02:50:49,080
The moment he interrupted the first attack.

4097
02:50:51,880 --> 02:50:52,680
Oh god.

4098
02:50:52,680 --> 02:50:53,860
Wait, what is he doing?

4099
02:50:53,980 --> 02:50:55,240
What is he doing?

4100
02:50:55,860 --> 02:50:58,120
I don't know what that move is!

4101
02:50:59,080 --> 02:50:59,740
No!

4102
02:51:03,180 --> 02:51:04,860
He's in the air!

4103
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:08,900
How do I hit things in the air?

4104
02:51:10,510 --> 02:51:11,200
Oh god.

4105
02:51:18,990 --> 02:51:19,600
Monkey's scared!

4106
02:51:21,060 --> 02:51:22,260
Monkey's so scared!

4107
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:23,580
Poke!

4108
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:27,140
Guys, I only did like one...

4109
02:51:27,140 --> 02:51:28,580
Not even one third!

4110
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:31,660
Like one sixth damage!

4111
02:51:32,040 --> 02:51:33,200
Holy shit!

4112
02:51:34,100 --> 02:51:35,450
Oh my god!

4113
02:51:37,220 --> 02:51:38,600
He's so cool.

4114
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:44,260
Holy shit!

4115
02:51:45,100 --> 02:51:47,420
This guy is so difficult!

4116
02:51:47,480 --> 02:51:49,200
Okay, it didn't help that...

4117
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:51,640
It definitely...

4118
02:51:51,640 --> 02:51:52,340
Um...

4119
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:55,780
It definitely did not help that, you know...

4120
02:51:55,780 --> 02:51:57,120
I messed up...

4121
02:51:57,120 --> 02:51:58,700
I messed up my spellbinder.

4122
02:51:58,940 --> 02:52:02,780
I messed it up.

4123
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:04,800
Okay.

4124
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:06,260
Alright.

4125
02:52:07,640 --> 02:52:08,800
God fucking...

4126
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:09,760
Okay, fine.

4127
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:14,060
Okay, that is not a lot of damage.

4128
02:52:17,180 --> 02:52:18,900
Wait a minute!

4129
02:52:18,900 --> 02:52:19,100
That...

4130
02:52:19,100 --> 02:52:22,500
That is not a lot of damage!

4131
02:52:24,680 --> 02:52:25,960
Even with...

4132
02:52:25,960 --> 02:52:28,080
Even with the spellbinder!

4133
02:52:29,720 --> 02:52:31,840
It did so little!

4134
02:52:32,240 --> 02:52:33,780
Wait, he's the first one.

4135
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:36,860
I did kill all his little brothers and sisters.

4136
02:52:37,880 --> 02:52:39,280
Oh my god.

4137
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:42,640
Guys, yeah, you think I did more than the last...

4138
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:43,480
Yeah, no shit.

4139
02:52:43,740 --> 02:52:44,860
No shit.

4140
02:52:44,860 --> 02:52:45,280
Okay.

4141
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:47,700
Can I craft new stuff?

4142
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:49,400
Do I have...

4143
02:52:49,400 --> 02:52:51,840
Do I have stronger...

4144
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:52,960
No, I do not.

4145
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:53,580
Okay.

4146
02:52:53,880 --> 02:52:54,780
That's fine.

4147
02:52:55,100 --> 02:52:55,960
That's fine.

4148
02:52:57,480 --> 02:52:58,680
That's a-okay.

4149
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:03,260
That's totally fine.

4150
02:53:04,960 --> 02:53:05,620
That's...

4151
02:53:05,620 --> 02:53:06,260
That's fine.

4152
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:07,220
That's fine.

4153
02:53:09,980 --> 02:53:10,640
It's...

4154
02:53:10,640 --> 02:53:11,700
It's okay.

4155
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:13,240
I have an idea.

4156
02:53:16,320 --> 02:53:17,260
I have an idea.

4157
02:53:22,300 --> 02:53:23,320
That's not the idea.

4158
02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:24,640
That...

4159
02:53:27,100 --> 02:53:28,260
By the way, guys.

4160
02:53:28,320 --> 02:53:31,480
I don't know if you know this, but that was not the idea I was thinking of.

4161
02:53:31,540 --> 02:53:34,400
I don't know if you know this, but that was not the idea I was thinking of.

4162
02:53:36,980 --> 02:53:38,020
That wasn't it.

4163
02:53:40,480 --> 02:53:40,880
Like...

4164
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:42,080
Now...

4165
02:53:42,080 --> 02:53:43,060
Now...

4166
02:53:43,060 --> 02:53:43,640
Now...

4167
02:53:43,640 --> 02:53:45,320
This is it.

4168
02:53:47,060 --> 02:53:49,580
What do you mean you cheese it with heavy...

4169
02:53:49,580 --> 02:53:50,580
Like that?

4170
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:54,240
Jesus Christ.

4171
02:53:54,980 --> 02:53:55,800
Maybe if I...

4172
02:53:55,800 --> 02:53:57,960
Maybe if I cheese it too.

4173
02:53:58,520 --> 02:53:59,420
Like that?

4174
02:54:01,220 --> 02:54:01,820
Guys.

4175
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:03,560
Okay.

4176
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:05,680
Okay, we just gotta regen.

4177
02:54:06,540 --> 02:54:07,880
Okay, we can do this.

4178
02:54:11,550 --> 02:54:13,430
Okay, we can do this.

4179
02:54:16,320 --> 02:54:16,920
Okay, wait.

4180
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:17,640
I have an idea.

4181
02:54:21,240 --> 02:54:22,360
That's not the idea.

4182
02:54:26,310 --> 02:54:27,210
That's not the idea.

4183
02:54:27,290 --> 02:54:27,770
That's not the idea.

4184
02:54:28,810 --> 02:54:29,090
Please.

4185
02:54:29,770 --> 02:54:30,250
Please.

4186
02:54:32,150 --> 02:54:32,630
Okay.

4187
02:54:34,990 --> 02:54:35,930
Okay, I have...

4188
02:54:35,930 --> 02:54:36,990
Guys, I think it's working.

4189
02:54:38,330 --> 02:54:38,810
Okay.

4190
02:54:39,290 --> 02:54:39,950
Guys, I...

4191
02:54:40,530 --> 02:54:41,010
Guys.

4192
02:54:44,890 --> 02:54:46,670
I don't think it's working.

4193
02:54:46,670 --> 02:54:47,510
I can't...

4194
02:54:47,510 --> 02:54:50,670
I can't...

4195
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:55,780
I didn't think...

4196
02:54:56,720 --> 02:54:58,620
Guys, I don't think it's working.

4197
02:54:58,840 --> 02:54:59,300
Guys.

4198
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:01,280
It needs to be...

4199
02:55:01,280 --> 02:55:02,660
Oh my god.

4200
02:55:04,360 --> 02:55:04,980
No.

4201
02:55:05,100 --> 02:55:06,260
I figured it out.

4202
02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:08,460
I figured it out.

4203
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:10,400
Somebody says use this.

4204
02:55:10,620 --> 02:55:11,780
I figured it out, guys.

4205
02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:14,100
This is it.

4206
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:16,040
It's wolf hours.

4207
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:17,660
Wolf...

4208
02:55:18,420 --> 02:55:18,760
Wolf...

4209
02:55:19,900 --> 02:55:20,480
Wolf...

4210
02:55:20,480 --> 02:55:21,760
Wolf...

4211
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:25,980
Big baby!

4212
02:55:26,780 --> 02:55:26,820
Big baby!

4213
02:55:27,060 --> 02:55:28,220
Okay.

4214
02:55:30,220 --> 02:55:30,800
Okay.

4215
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:33,880
Fine.

4216
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:36,000
I

4217
02:55:40,060 --> 02:55:40,700
told you!

4218
02:55:41,280 --> 02:55:43,220
I told you!

4219
02:55:43,220 --> 02:55:44,760
The moment I dodged this!

4220
02:55:45,340 --> 02:55:45,720
The moment I dodged this!

4221
02:55:46,660 --> 02:55:47,820
What?!

4222
02:55:48,480 --> 02:55:49,720
What?!

4223
02:55:49,720 --> 02:55:49,840
What?!

4224
02:55:52,480 --> 02:55:53,600
Okay, but like...

4225
02:55:59,080 --> 02:56:03,620
Oh, it works!

4226
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:04,560
Fuck!

4227
02:56:13,850 --> 02:56:14,930
Okay.

4228
02:56:19,460 --> 02:56:19,480
Okay.

4229
02:56:21,180 --> 02:56:21,720
Okay.

4230
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:37,580
Okay.

4231
02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:39,700
Okay.

4232
02:56:40,060 --> 02:56:40,600
Okay.

4233
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:40,840
Okay.

4234
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:41,740
Okay.

4235
02:56:41,740 --> 02:56:41,820
Okay.

4236
02:56:42,260 --> 02:56:43,000
Okay.

4237
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:47,560
Oh, shit!

4238
02:56:47,700 --> 02:56:51,140
I didn't even realize this human was still there.

4239
02:56:51,140 --> 02:56:53,560
I was too busy.

4240
02:56:57,200 --> 02:56:57,920
Okay.

4241
02:56:58,260 --> 02:56:58,980
Okay.

4242
02:56:58,980 --> 02:57:00,320
Let's level this up.

4243
02:57:01,400 --> 02:57:02,120
Okay.

4244
02:57:02,820 --> 02:57:03,180
Okay.

4245
02:57:05,900 --> 02:57:06,620
Okay.

4246
02:57:07,140 --> 02:57:07,860
Okay.

4247
02:57:08,420 --> 02:57:09,140
Alright.

4248
02:57:09,300 --> 02:57:11,760
What makes it so that no longer falls?

4249
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:13,400
Okay, we need that.

4250
02:57:13,660 --> 02:57:15,760
No longer falls.

4251
02:57:16,040 --> 02:57:17,260
Alright, guys.

4252
02:57:17,260 --> 02:57:17,500
Guys.

4253
02:57:17,780 --> 02:57:19,460
Guys, we're gonna be okay.

4254
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:20,900
We no longer fall.

4255
02:57:21,440 --> 02:57:24,320
Guys, we no longer fall now.

4256
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:24,840
Guys.

4257
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:28,260
Guys, we're no longer gonna fall anymore.

4258
02:57:29,020 --> 02:57:30,740
Guys, we fixed the problem.

4259
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:31,960
We...

4260
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:34,400
We fixed the issue.

4261
02:57:35,380 --> 02:57:36,760
We fixed it.

4262
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:38,280
Oh my god.

4263
02:57:38,320 --> 02:57:39,720
We fixed the problem.

4264
02:57:43,060 --> 02:57:43,400
No!

4265
02:57:43,400 --> 02:57:44,200
Okay.

4266
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:46,240
Okay, I thought I fucked up.

4267
02:57:46,620 --> 02:57:48,740
I always think I fucked up.

4268
02:57:51,220 --> 02:57:51,780
That's fine.

4269
02:57:52,620 --> 02:57:54,120
We fixed the issue.

4270
02:57:55,780 --> 02:57:57,720
What you gonna do now?

4271
02:57:58,100 --> 02:57:59,520
That's fucking right.

4272
02:58:00,420 --> 02:58:02,100
That's fucking right.

4273
02:58:02,360 --> 02:58:02,620
That's fucking right.

4274
02:58:03,140 --> 02:58:04,840
I figure out the cheese.

4275
02:58:06,260 --> 02:58:07,040
That's right!

4276
02:58:07,340 --> 02:58:08,920
You can't do anything!

4277
02:58:09,180 --> 02:58:09,420
Oh

4278
02:58:13,760 --> 02:58:14,120
my god!

4279
02:58:22,090 --> 02:58:23,470
Okay, I can keep doing this.

4280
02:58:26,670 --> 02:58:27,190
Boom!

4281
02:58:28,730 --> 02:58:29,250
Ow.

4282
02:58:30,730 --> 02:58:31,410
It's fine.

4283
02:58:32,630 --> 02:58:33,810
I figured it out.

4284
02:58:35,230 --> 02:58:35,750
Okay.

4285
02:58:36,330 --> 02:58:37,250
This is fine.

4286
02:58:43,990 --> 02:58:45,710
Can't do anything now!

4287
02:58:47,330 --> 02:58:48,990
Can't do anything now!

4288
02:58:49,710 --> 02:58:50,110
Okay.

4289
02:58:51,490 --> 02:58:52,370
Oh, fuck!

4290
02:58:52,430 --> 02:58:53,110
Okay, I'm sorry!

4291
02:58:53,850 --> 02:58:54,370
No!

4292
02:58:54,530 --> 02:58:55,790
I'm so sorry!

4293
02:58:55,970 --> 02:58:56,810
I'm so sorry!

4294
02:58:57,270 --> 02:58:57,790
Okay,

4295
02:59:03,490 --> 02:59:04,970
I'm learning his combos.

4296
02:59:07,770 --> 02:59:10,350
Pride comes before the fall.

4297
02:59:10,610 --> 02:59:10,930
It's okay.

4298
02:59:11,510 --> 02:59:13,650
Evil Shock, thank you for the super chat.

4299
02:59:13,810 --> 02:59:15,190
Thank you, thank you.

4300
02:59:15,950 --> 02:59:17,630
Guys, okay, but like...

4301
02:59:17,630 --> 02:59:18,490
I figured it out.

4302
02:59:19,710 --> 02:59:21,110
I know what to do now.

4303
02:59:21,350 --> 02:59:22,330
There's no way.

4304
02:59:23,630 --> 02:59:24,910
I know what to do.

4305
02:59:24,990 --> 02:59:26,590
It's so over for him.

4306
02:59:27,390 --> 02:59:28,650
It's so over.

4307
02:59:28,950 --> 02:59:31,150
There's nothing else he can do now.

4308
02:59:31,370 --> 02:59:33,710
Now that I shall master...

4309
02:59:34,370 --> 02:59:35,370
Hey, baby.

4310
02:59:36,170 --> 02:59:37,750
I have mastered...

4311
02:59:39,450 --> 02:59:41,550
I have mastered the pillar.

4312
02:59:42,970 --> 02:59:44,130
That's fucking right.

4313
02:59:44,210 --> 02:59:45,490
What you gonna do?

4314
02:59:45,950 --> 02:59:46,510
Nothing!

4315
02:59:47,970 --> 02:59:48,530
Nothing!

4316
02:59:50,410 --> 02:59:51,950
That's fucking right.

4317
02:59:52,250 --> 02:59:55,830
I am taking damage.

4318
02:59:57,250 --> 02:59:57,890
Okay.

4319
02:59:58,750 --> 02:59:59,570
All right.

4320
02:59:59,590 --> 03:00:04,210
Now that I know he can still do something when I'm up there, that's okay.

4321
03:00:05,270 --> 03:00:07,650
But what you gonna do now?

4322
03:00:08,610 --> 03:00:09,250
Nothing!

4323
03:00:09,490 --> 03:00:09,950
Okay.

4324
03:00:12,110 --> 03:00:13,150
Still something.

4325
03:00:13,950 --> 03:00:14,590
Okay.

4326
03:00:16,570 --> 03:00:17,750
No, I should...

4327
03:00:17,750 --> 03:00:17,910
Oh!

4328
03:00:20,530 --> 03:00:21,170
Oh!

4329
03:00:21,770 --> 03:00:22,290
Oh!

4330
03:00:23,690 --> 03:00:24,330
Oh!

4331
03:00:25,890 --> 03:00:26,530
Okay.

4332
03:00:26,730 --> 03:00:27,850
We can do this.

4333
03:00:28,010 --> 03:00:28,190
Okay.

4334
03:00:28,250 --> 03:00:29,070
I'm gonna lock in.

4335
03:00:30,010 --> 03:00:36,210
I'm gonna lock it in.

4336
03:00:37,490 --> 03:00:39,050
I'm gonna lock it in.

4337
03:00:39,370 --> 03:00:43,050
This is fine.

4338
03:00:44,030 --> 03:00:45,110
This is fine.

4339
03:00:48,780 --> 03:00:49,420
Okay.

4340
03:00:49,740 --> 03:00:50,540
It's okay.

4341
03:00:51,660 --> 03:00:52,100
It's okay.

4342
03:00:52,120 --> 03:00:53,220
We figured it out, though.

4343
03:00:53,360 --> 03:00:55,840
Like, we're so locked in now.

4344
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:58,600
We're so locked in.

4345
03:01:02,240 --> 03:01:02,800
Boom!

4346
03:01:03,300 --> 03:01:03,860
Okay.

4347
03:01:06,040 --> 03:01:06,780
All right.

4348
03:01:06,880 --> 03:01:08,740
He doesn't attack until he's closer.

4349
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:09,960
That's good to know.

4350
03:01:11,020 --> 03:01:11,580
Guys.

4351
03:01:11,940 --> 03:01:12,500
Guys.

4352
03:01:12,580 --> 03:01:13,920
He started to attack.

4353
03:01:15,060 --> 03:01:16,180
He started.

4354
03:01:16,760 --> 03:01:20,760
Because I thought you said he doesn't attack until he starts getting closer.

4355
03:01:21,100 --> 03:01:24,420
Why was he so far away when he attacked?

4356
03:01:24,660 --> 03:01:25,060
Guys!

4357
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:27,180
You guys lied!

4358
03:01:28,200 --> 03:01:30,960
Spreading misinformation on the internet!

4359
03:01:33,480 --> 03:01:34,280
Spreading misinformation on the internet!

4360
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:34,940
Oh my god.

4361
03:01:35,100 --> 03:01:35,820
Okay.

4362
03:01:37,500 --> 03:01:38,680
Oh, it's okay.

4363
03:01:38,900 --> 03:01:39,780
It's okay.

4364
03:01:39,940 --> 03:01:41,940
It's so okay.

4365
03:01:42,340 --> 03:01:43,620
It's so okay.

4366
03:01:47,120 --> 03:01:47,640
Let's see.

4367
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:48,660
Gotta do a slam.

4368
03:01:49,240 --> 03:01:49,960
Oh, god.

4369
03:01:50,360 --> 03:01:51,120
Oh, god.

4370
03:01:51,880 --> 03:01:52,320
Okay.

4371
03:01:52,400 --> 03:01:53,260
That was a waste.

4372
03:01:54,360 --> 03:01:54,980
Oh, no.

4373
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:55,700
He's doing a thing.

4374
03:01:55,860 --> 03:01:56,880
He's doing a thing.

4375
03:01:58,640 --> 03:01:59,080
No!

4376
03:01:59,080 --> 03:01:59,520
Fuck!

4377
03:02:01,120 --> 03:02:01,560
Okay.

4378
03:02:03,440 --> 03:02:03,880
Okay.

4379
03:02:04,220 --> 03:02:06,040
When he pulls it...

4380
03:02:11,800 --> 03:02:12,680
I'm dying!

4381
03:02:20,080 --> 03:02:21,360
Oh, my god.

4382
03:02:21,380 --> 03:02:22,500
The timing!

4383
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:23,040
Oh, my god.

4384
03:02:23,040 --> 03:02:24,620
This is so difficult!

4385
03:02:25,420 --> 03:02:27,320
It's so difficult!

4386
03:02:30,160 --> 03:02:31,720
Oh, my god.

4387
03:02:31,860 --> 03:02:34,700
Why is the timing so hard?

4388
03:02:35,360 --> 03:02:35,480
Why is the timing so hard?

4389
03:02:35,480 --> 03:02:35,720
Why is the timing so hard?

4390
03:02:37,220 --> 03:02:39,920
The cheese isn't working, guys!

4391
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:40,500
The cheese isn't working, guys!

4392
03:02:40,500 --> 03:02:40,680
Okay.

4393
03:02:42,040 --> 03:02:42,880
All right.

4394
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:44,860
Pull focus.

4395
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:45,940
Pull focus.

4396
03:02:46,160 --> 03:02:46,280
Guys.

4397
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:47,600
Full focus.

4398
03:02:52,780 --> 03:02:53,400
Okay.

4399
03:02:53,400 --> 03:02:54,140
All right.

4400
03:02:57,020 --> 03:02:58,020
Full focus.

4401
03:02:58,100 --> 03:02:58,460
Full focus.

4402
03:02:59,660 --> 03:03:00,680
Full focus.

4403
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:01,340
Full focus.

4404
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:03,740
Oh!

4405
03:03:03,960 --> 03:03:04,560
Oh!

4406
03:03:06,180 --> 03:03:07,180
Full focus.

4407
03:03:07,240 --> 03:03:08,140
Full focus, Toki.

4408
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:09,540
Full focus!

4409
03:03:11,600 --> 03:03:12,600
Full focus!

4410
03:03:15,200 --> 03:03:16,180
Oh, fuck!

4411
03:03:16,670 --> 03:03:16,980
Okay.

4412
03:03:18,880 --> 03:03:19,360
Damn!

4413
03:03:21,600 --> 03:03:22,520
All right.

4414
03:03:22,720 --> 03:03:23,880
Full focus.

4415
03:03:24,700 --> 03:03:25,600
You got this!

4416
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:27,940
What the fuck was that?

4417
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:31,880
I never saw that move before!

4418
03:03:33,420 --> 03:03:35,360
There's more moves?

4419
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:36,760
How many moves do you need?

4420
03:03:37,660 --> 03:03:38,420
Like...

4421
03:03:38,420 --> 03:03:40,480
How do you have more?

4422
03:03:40,880 --> 03:03:42,280
Oh, my god.

4423
03:03:45,580 --> 03:03:46,340
Okay.

4424
03:03:50,480 --> 03:03:54,220
I hate that move so much!

4425
03:03:55,080 --> 03:03:55,760
I hate that move so much!

4426
03:03:55,760 --> 03:03:57,040
I can't use immobilize!

4427
03:03:57,100 --> 03:03:58,720
I have spellbinding!

4428
03:03:59,280 --> 03:04:01,480
I have spellbinding!

4429
03:04:01,480 --> 03:04:03,900
Is spellbinding bad against him?

4430
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:05,500
Do I use my other magic?

4431
03:04:07,980 --> 03:04:09,200
Which is better?

4432
03:04:09,320 --> 03:04:11,080
Spellbinding or my other magic?

4433
03:04:11,460 --> 03:04:12,860
Because if I use...

4434
03:04:13,960 --> 03:04:14,620
It's bad?

4435
03:04:14,900 --> 03:04:15,120
Okay.

4436
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:15,340
Okay.

4437
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:19,160
It's time to reset.

4438
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:20,820
It's time.

4439
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:23,120
Okay.

4440
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:24,400
All right.

4441
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:26,160
Where is it?

4442
03:04:26,720 --> 03:04:27,440
Transformation.

4443
03:04:27,540 --> 03:04:28,040
Strength.

4444
03:04:29,120 --> 03:04:30,560
All right.

4445
03:04:30,700 --> 03:04:32,120
Goodbye, everything.

4446
03:04:34,760 --> 03:04:35,480
Goodbye.

4447
03:04:37,080 --> 03:04:37,800
Goodbye.

4448
03:04:38,060 --> 03:04:38,780
Goodbye.

4449
03:04:38,780 --> 03:04:39,440
Goodbye.

4450
03:04:39,440 --> 03:04:39,800
Goodbye.

4451
03:04:39,800 --> 03:04:40,140
Goodbye.

4452
03:04:40,800 --> 03:04:41,160
Goodbye.

4453
03:04:41,320 --> 03:04:41,600
Goodbye.

4454
03:04:41,600 --> 03:04:41,860
Goodbye.

4455
03:04:41,960 --> 03:04:42,560
Goodbye.

4456
03:04:43,240 --> 03:04:43,580
Goodbye.

4457
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:45,500
Goodbye.

4458
03:04:45,740 --> 03:04:45,740
Goodbye.

4459
03:04:46,120 --> 03:04:46,120
Goodbye.

4460
03:04:46,600 --> 03:04:46,600
Goodbye.

4461
03:04:46,880 --> 03:04:46,880
Goodbye.

4462
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:46,920
Goodbye.

4463
03:04:46,980 --> 03:04:47,080
Goodbye.

4464
03:04:47,080 --> 03:04:47,320
Goodbye.

4465
03:04:47,320 --> 03:04:47,720
Goodbye.

4466
03:04:47,800 --> 03:04:48,420
Goodbye.

4467
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:48,440
Goodbye.

4468
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:48,960
Goodbye.

4469
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:48,960
Goodbye.

4470
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:48,960
Goodbye.

4471
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:50,840
And then Cloud Step.

4472
03:04:51,100 --> 03:04:52,040
Okay, I have two left.

4473
03:04:52,520 --> 03:04:54,740
I'll put everything else in Cloud Step now.

4474
03:04:57,860 --> 03:04:59,600
It increases the... alright.

4475
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:01,900
Alright, there we go.

4476
03:05:02,140 --> 03:05:03,600
And then we'll get the Gourd.

4477
03:05:08,430 --> 03:05:09,550
Where's my Brew?

4478
03:05:09,990 --> 03:05:11,230
Okay, I need the...

4479
03:05:11,230 --> 03:05:14,590
It increases... it increases...

4480
03:05:15,140 --> 03:05:18,770
Health Recovery... I'm gonna use the Cloud Step Gourd.

4481
03:05:20,330 --> 03:05:20,710
Alright.

4482
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:25,000
Okay, yeah.

4483
03:05:25,380 --> 03:05:26,720
Wait, actually...

4484
03:05:31,020 --> 03:05:34,000
I should grab this one then.

4485
03:05:34,300 --> 03:05:35,780
Because it increases my mana.

4486
03:05:36,460 --> 03:05:39,880
And then... it also increases how I'm using...

4487
03:05:41,100 --> 03:05:41,880
Cloud Step.

4488
03:05:42,020 --> 03:05:42,620
Okay, there we go.

4489
03:05:44,680 --> 03:05:45,200
Okay.

4490
03:05:48,260 --> 03:05:49,400
Alright, here we go.

4491
03:05:50,040 --> 03:05:52,160
Okay, but like, what if like I send in...

4492
03:05:52,180 --> 03:05:53,200
a bunch of my monkeys?

4493
03:05:54,980 --> 03:05:55,740
There we go.

4494
03:05:56,120 --> 03:05:57,380
It's over for you.

4495
03:05:57,940 --> 03:05:59,100
I figured it out.

4496
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,100
I shall use my other moves.

4497
03:06:03,500 --> 03:06:04,500
There we go!

4498
03:06:06,920 --> 03:06:09,060
He didn't... I forgot to swap.

4499
03:06:09,280 --> 03:06:14,100
I still have Spellbind.

4500
03:06:14,380 --> 03:06:14,740
I...

4501
03:06:14,740 --> 03:06:15,800
I...

4502
03:06:23,400 --> 03:06:25,760
I stopped...

4503
03:06:30,870 --> 03:06:32,080
Oh, my God!

4504
03:06:32,280 --> 03:06:33,000
Okay.

4505
03:06:33,300 --> 03:06:34,240
Okay.

4506
03:06:34,590 --> 03:06:35,220
Okay.

4507
03:06:35,870 --> 03:06:36,500
I...

4508
03:06:36,510 --> 03:06:38,940
I did not have a Plat.

4509
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:44,580
Okay, let me...

4510
03:06:44,580 --> 03:06:46,360
Set spells...

4511
03:06:46,360 --> 03:06:47,060
Okay.

4512
03:06:47,420 --> 03:06:48,440
Now...

4513
03:06:48,440 --> 03:06:52,140
Now everything is where it should be.

4514
03:06:53,560 --> 03:06:58,020
We have so many transformations, holy shit.

4515
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:01,640
I feel like wolf is the best though.

4516
03:07:01,700 --> 03:07:02,880
Wolf is the best, right?

4517
03:07:02,980 --> 03:07:03,760
The transformation.

4518
03:07:06,360 --> 03:07:08,580
Out of all of them, you stone?

4519
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:09,600
This one?

4520
03:07:10,820 --> 03:07:11,720
Acer dust?

4521
03:07:11,880 --> 03:07:12,360
This one?

4522
03:07:13,960 --> 03:07:15,120
The rock why?

4523
03:07:15,960 --> 03:07:16,920
Or tiger?

4524
03:07:21,310 --> 03:07:21,950
Tiger?

4525
03:07:21,950 --> 03:07:23,310
Okay.

4526
03:07:23,970 --> 03:07:25,950
Toward a light attack.

4527
03:07:26,250 --> 03:07:27,310
Jesus Christ!

4528
03:07:29,170 --> 03:07:31,010
Okay, let me read this.

4529
03:07:31,630 --> 03:07:32,930
Heavy attack.

4530
03:07:33,150 --> 03:07:34,830
To deflect assault.

4531
03:07:35,110 --> 03:07:35,430
Okay.

4532
03:07:35,630 --> 03:07:37,230
I have a spell.

4533
03:07:37,470 --> 03:07:41,350
Upon full focus, convert all focus into swiftness.

4534
03:07:41,530 --> 03:07:44,950
With swiftness, dodging transforms, allowing you...

4535
03:07:44,950 --> 03:07:45,370
Alright.

4536
03:07:48,730 --> 03:07:51,330
Upon entering... Okay, we gotta do this.

4537
03:07:51,430 --> 03:07:51,690
Okay.

4538
03:07:53,850 --> 03:07:54,850
Alright, here we go.

4539
03:07:56,350 --> 03:07:57,310
How do I block?

4540
03:07:59,610 --> 03:08:00,350
Okay, V.

4541
03:08:00,830 --> 03:08:01,390
Okay.

4542
03:08:02,870 --> 03:08:03,610
It's time.

4543
03:08:05,630 --> 03:08:06,930
That's fucking right.

4544
03:08:07,130 --> 03:08:08,610
That's... That's not right.

4545
03:08:10,570 --> 03:08:11,830
That's fucking right.

4546
03:08:13,290 --> 03:08:14,250
That's... No!

4547
03:08:14,270 --> 03:08:15,350
That is not right!

4548
03:08:17,330 --> 03:08:18,810
Can I hold it?

4549
03:08:19,410 --> 03:08:20,550
What you gonna do?

4550
03:08:21,150 --> 03:08:21,930
What you gonna do?

4551
03:08:21,930 --> 03:08:22,470
What you gonna do?

4552
03:08:24,070 --> 03:08:24,910
Nothing.

4553
03:08:27,790 --> 03:08:29,090
That's right!

4554
03:08:29,910 --> 03:08:30,750
Nothing!

4555
03:08:32,590 --> 03:08:34,730
I'm doing barely any damage.

4556
03:08:34,870 --> 03:08:36,270
I'm not gonna lie.

4557
03:08:37,610 --> 03:08:39,590
I'm not gonna lie.

4558
03:08:40,190 --> 03:08:45,150
The damage is not that much.

4559
03:08:46,730 --> 03:08:48,710
Oh, do it after you transform.

4560
03:08:48,970 --> 03:08:50,950
Okay, that makes a lot more sense actually.

4561
03:08:50,950 --> 03:08:51,990
Like...

4562
03:08:51,990 --> 03:08:55,450
That actually makes a lot more sense.

4563
03:08:55,790 --> 03:08:57,070
Cause I'm just like...

4564
03:08:57,070 --> 03:08:59,310
Guys, I don't think I'm doing a lot of damage.

4565
03:09:03,010 --> 03:09:04,250
Oh, shit.

4566
03:09:06,290 --> 03:09:07,310
Okay, recovery.

4567
03:09:09,650 --> 03:09:10,270
Okay.

4568
03:09:10,650 --> 03:09:11,470
Oh, no!

4569
03:09:11,910 --> 03:09:12,530
Dodge!

4570
03:09:13,330 --> 03:09:13,950
Dodge!

4571
03:09:14,720 --> 03:09:16,030
I remember that moveset!

4572
03:09:17,290 --> 03:09:17,910
Okay.

4573
03:09:18,550 --> 03:09:19,830
Oh, here he goes.

4574
03:09:20,690 --> 03:09:21,190
Ha!

4575
03:09:21,330 --> 03:09:22,230
What is he gonna do?

4576
03:09:22,770 --> 03:09:23,630
He's gonna do that.

4577
03:09:23,790 --> 03:09:24,050
Oh.

4578
03:09:24,390 --> 03:09:24,890
Okay.

4579
03:09:26,070 --> 03:09:26,570
Alright.

4580
03:09:28,670 --> 03:09:29,170
Okay.

4581
03:09:30,830 --> 03:09:31,330
Ah!

4582
03:09:31,590 --> 03:09:32,190
Okay, I got it!

4583
03:09:34,050 --> 03:09:34,970
Oh, I got it!

4584
03:09:35,050 --> 03:09:35,810
I got it!

4585
03:09:35,990 --> 03:09:36,810
Oh, my God!

4586
03:09:38,230 --> 03:09:40,610
That move is so fucking scary!

4587
03:09:43,090 --> 03:09:43,590
Okay.

4588
03:09:46,590 --> 03:09:47,090
Oh!

4589
03:09:47,510 --> 03:09:47,690
Oh!

4590
03:09:54,430 --> 03:09:55,570
Final slam!

4591
03:09:56,810 --> 03:09:57,310
Ah!

4592
03:09:57,430 --> 03:09:57,830
No!

4593
03:09:57,830 --> 03:09:57,970
Oh, my God!

4594
03:09:58,550 --> 03:10:00,370
I did so well!

4595
03:10:00,510 --> 03:10:02,210
It's the fi- Ah!

4596
03:10:02,310 --> 03:10:03,330
He does so much!

4597
03:10:03,690 --> 03:10:05,630
He does so much damage!

4598
03:10:06,410 --> 03:10:09,210
It literally one-shot me!

4599
03:10:12,210 --> 03:10:14,030
Oh, my God!

4600
03:10:14,510 --> 03:10:16,770
Bro, this is not fair!

4601
03:10:17,930 --> 03:10:18,610
Okay.

4602
03:10:21,930 --> 03:10:24,230
Alright, I feel like I have to do this then.

4603
03:10:24,990 --> 03:10:26,690
Like, for the big baby.

4604
03:10:26,830 --> 03:10:27,210
Okay.

4605
03:10:27,610 --> 03:10:27,810
Okay.

4606
03:10:28,770 --> 03:10:29,210
Nice.

4607
03:10:29,730 --> 03:10:31,570
Did you guys set to do full focus?

4608
03:10:32,150 --> 03:10:33,770
Wait, I don't have full focus, though!

4609
03:10:33,870 --> 03:10:35,410
Guys, I don't have full focus!

4610
03:10:35,510 --> 03:10:36,170
Does it still work?

4611
03:10:38,130 --> 03:10:40,530
I don't- Oh.

4612
03:10:40,810 --> 03:10:41,390
Oh, God.

4613
03:10:41,430 --> 03:10:42,210
I don't have full focus.

4614
03:10:42,270 --> 03:10:42,730
I just noticed.

4615
03:10:42,950 --> 03:10:43,890
I just noticed.

4616
03:10:44,090 --> 03:10:48,070
I- I have been upgraded to Tiger!

4617
03:10:50,870 --> 03:10:51,310
Okay.

4618
03:10:51,470 --> 03:10:52,850
Am I doing any damage?

4619
03:10:53,150 --> 03:10:53,870
I'm not.

4620
03:10:54,750 --> 03:10:55,190
Okay.

4621
03:10:55,950 --> 03:10:56,390
Boom.

4622
03:10:57,350 --> 03:10:57,790
Okay.

4623
03:10:57,810 --> 03:10:59,150
I did it!

4624
03:10:59,170 --> 03:10:59,550
I did it!

4625
03:10:59,550 --> 03:11:01,070
I didn't unlock full focus yet, guys!

4626
03:11:01,330 --> 03:11:02,770
I'm trapped!

4627
03:11:03,650 --> 03:11:06,730
I'm trapped in the grass!

4628
03:11:06,730 --> 03:11:13,390
I can't- I actually can't move at all!

4629
03:11:13,850 --> 03:11:15,210
I'm stuck!

4630
03:11:16,650 --> 03:11:19,090
I'm actually stuck!

4631
03:11:19,090 --> 03:11:23,030
Even he's like, are you okay there?

4632
03:11:23,270 --> 03:11:24,810
I'm not there.

4633
03:11:25,030 --> 03:11:26,470
I'm not.

4634
03:11:26,530 --> 03:11:28,470
I'm stuck in the grass.

4635
03:11:28,830 --> 03:11:31,230
Let me out of the grass.

4636
03:11:32,550 --> 03:11:34,390
Holy fuck.

4637
03:11:34,790 --> 03:11:37,030
I didn't even notice that.

4638
03:11:39,950 --> 03:11:42,390
That's so unfortunate for me.

4639
03:11:43,950 --> 03:11:46,550
Of course I'm stuck.

4640
03:11:46,550 --> 03:11:46,970
I'm stuck.

4641
03:11:48,630 --> 03:11:49,590
Leave Doki.

4642
03:11:54,510 --> 03:11:56,530
It's a fucking fire move.

4643
03:11:57,230 --> 03:11:59,670
It's a fucking fire move.

4644
03:11:59,750 --> 03:12:00,930
There's no point in...

4645
03:12:00,930 --> 03:12:02,530
Guys, I think the wolf is better.

4646
03:12:04,890 --> 03:12:06,430
Because I don't have four focus.

4647
03:12:07,070 --> 03:12:08,230
There's like no point.

4648
03:12:08,990 --> 03:12:12,150
There's no point in being a tiger if I don't have four focus.

4649
03:12:13,290 --> 03:12:15,250
I feel like I should just stick with the wolf.

4650
03:12:21,780 --> 03:12:23,300
Alright, I'm gonna set spells.

4651
03:12:23,920 --> 03:12:26,160
If I upgrade the tiger, it still doesn't matter.

4652
03:12:26,320 --> 03:12:27,720
I don't have four focus though.

4653
03:12:30,850 --> 03:12:31,430
Do I?

4654
03:12:31,450 --> 03:12:32,790
Can I upgrade to four focus?

4655
03:12:33,110 --> 03:12:33,550
Okay.

4656
03:12:34,190 --> 03:12:35,230
I don't have... wait.

4657
03:12:35,390 --> 03:12:36,510
Do I have enough?

4658
03:12:37,070 --> 03:12:38,050
Do I have enough?

4659
03:12:38,250 --> 03:12:39,690
I don't have enough to upgrade though.

4660
03:12:39,850 --> 03:12:40,530
I'm pretty sure.

4661
03:12:40,570 --> 03:12:40,810
Do I?

4662
03:12:47,330 --> 03:12:48,250
Where is it?

4663
03:12:49,990 --> 03:12:51,650
How do I upgrade to four?

4664
03:12:55,730 --> 03:12:56,170
Word.

4665
03:12:57,010 --> 03:12:58,290
How do I upgrade it?

4666
03:13:00,830 --> 03:13:02,210
It's in staff stance?

4667
03:13:02,670 --> 03:13:02,990
Okay.

4668
03:13:03,650 --> 03:13:05,030
I'll take something out.

4669
03:13:05,270 --> 03:13:06,330
I guess I'll take...

4670
03:13:08,430 --> 03:13:09,410
Where is it?

4671
03:13:10,830 --> 03:13:12,070
I need one more.

4672
03:13:15,460 --> 03:13:16,540
Spend more sparks.

4673
03:13:17,400 --> 03:13:18,480
I need one.

4674
03:13:20,140 --> 03:13:21,740
I'm missing one point.

4675
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:23,560
Oh my god, it's time to farm.

4676
03:13:29,340 --> 03:13:31,360
It's time to fucking farm.

4677
03:13:32,300 --> 03:13:33,900
This is what they were for.

4678
03:13:34,700 --> 03:13:36,060
This is why they're here.

4679
03:13:36,560 --> 03:13:37,660
This is why they're here.

4680
03:13:39,420 --> 03:13:40,380
Give me.

4681
03:13:40,480 --> 03:13:40,940
I need.

4682
03:13:41,540 --> 03:13:42,020
Please.

4683
03:13:42,700 --> 03:13:44,020
I need more.

4684
03:13:44,780 --> 03:13:46,080
Oh, this is gonna take...

4685
03:13:46,080 --> 03:13:47,640
Guys, this is gonna take so long.

4686
03:13:48,040 --> 03:13:51,940
I realize this is gonna take so long.

4687
03:13:52,140 --> 03:13:54,420
Maria, thank you for the magenta soup.

4688
03:13:54,480 --> 03:13:56,300
But it takes too long.

4689
03:13:56,380 --> 03:13:57,660
I'm gonna...

4690
03:13:57,660 --> 03:14:00,180
I'm gonna...

4691
03:14:00,780 --> 03:14:01,260
Wait.

4692
03:14:01,360 --> 03:14:05,300
What if I don't wanna take it from another tree?

4693
03:14:06,100 --> 03:14:09,960
But I don't wanna.

4694
03:14:14,260 --> 03:14:15,060
Okay.

4695
03:14:16,960 --> 03:14:18,200
Why not?

4696
03:14:18,300 --> 03:14:18,580
What?

4697
03:14:20,040 --> 03:14:21,340
I don't know what to...

4698
03:14:21,340 --> 03:14:23,160
I don't know what to take away.

4699
03:14:24,240 --> 03:14:25,060
I guess...

4700
03:14:25,060 --> 03:14:26,300
Maybe...

4701
03:14:26,300 --> 03:14:27,260
One of this?

4702
03:14:33,230 --> 03:14:33,670
Okay.

4703
03:14:35,650 --> 03:14:36,090
Uh...

4704
03:14:38,690 --> 03:14:39,450
Here we go.

4705
03:14:40,950 --> 03:14:41,390
Okay.

4706
03:14:43,770 --> 03:14:44,410
All right.

4707
03:14:44,450 --> 03:14:44,910
Here we go.

4708
03:14:50,160 --> 03:14:50,600
Wait.

4709
03:14:51,540 --> 03:14:52,040
Do I not have four?

4710
03:14:52,300 --> 03:14:53,060
That's not four.

4711
03:14:53,520 --> 03:14:54,340
That's still three.

4712
03:14:56,180 --> 03:14:56,620
Wait.

4713
03:14:56,660 --> 03:14:57,160
What the fuck?

4714
03:14:58,800 --> 03:14:59,940
Why does it say three?

4715
03:15:00,640 --> 03:15:01,560
That's not four?

4716
03:15:01,840 --> 03:15:02,280
Okay.

4717
03:15:07,510 --> 03:15:07,890
Wait.

4718
03:15:09,370 --> 03:15:09,750
What?

4719
03:15:09,750 --> 03:15:09,930
Oh!

4720
03:15:12,290 --> 03:15:12,670
Oh!

4721
03:15:12,690 --> 03:15:13,150
The four...

4722
03:15:13,150 --> 03:15:14,530
How do I get down here?

4723
03:15:15,170 --> 03:15:18,570
How do I get back?

4724
03:15:18,710 --> 03:15:19,250
Oh, there you go.

4725
03:15:19,590 --> 03:15:19,970
Okay.

4726
03:15:21,590 --> 03:15:22,150
All right.

4727
03:15:22,230 --> 03:15:22,850
This is fine.

4728
03:15:24,130 --> 03:15:24,850
This is fine.

4729
03:15:25,750 --> 03:15:26,130
Okay.

4730
03:15:26,170 --> 03:15:26,750
I need a rest.

4731
03:15:26,950 --> 03:15:28,030
It's not fine, guys.

4732
03:15:28,530 --> 03:15:29,450
I need a rest.

4733
03:15:31,130 --> 03:15:31,750
You know what?

4734
03:15:31,790 --> 03:15:31,950
No.

4735
03:15:31,970 --> 03:15:32,490
This is...

4736
03:15:33,330 --> 03:15:34,190
I need a rest.

4737
03:15:34,250 --> 03:15:34,770
I need the baby.

4738
03:15:34,890 --> 03:15:35,970
I just realized I don't...

4739
03:15:35,970 --> 03:15:36,050
I don't know.

4740
03:15:36,070 --> 03:15:40,370
I have to reset it because, like, I need the big baby.

4741
03:15:40,910 --> 03:15:41,970
Guys, no more.

4742
03:15:43,050 --> 03:15:43,630
I...

4743
03:15:43,630 --> 03:15:44,210
No!

4744
03:15:46,490 --> 03:15:48,030
I had to!

4745
03:15:48,610 --> 03:15:50,510
I had to, guys!

4746
03:15:53,800 --> 03:15:54,530
Did I hit him?

4747
03:15:54,610 --> 03:15:55,130
I did.

4748
03:15:55,290 --> 03:15:55,650
Okay.

4749
03:15:55,690 --> 03:15:56,010
Nice.

4750
03:15:56,550 --> 03:15:57,450
Thank God.

4751
03:15:58,330 --> 03:15:59,010
All right.

4752
03:15:59,490 --> 03:16:00,210
All right.

4753
03:16:00,250 --> 03:16:00,930
Full focus.

4754
03:16:04,070 --> 03:16:05,330
Full focus, guys.

4755
03:16:06,070 --> 03:16:06,170
No!

4756
03:16:06,210 --> 03:16:06,950
Why did you do that?

4757
03:16:07,970 --> 03:16:09,470
Full focus starting now.

4758
03:16:13,370 --> 03:16:15,010
It was an accident.

4759
03:16:19,410 --> 03:16:19,930
Okay.

4760
03:16:20,990 --> 03:16:22,730
All right, now we full focus.

4761
03:16:23,670 --> 03:16:24,890
Are you serious?

4762
03:16:25,090 --> 03:16:25,670
That hit...

4763
03:16:25,670 --> 03:16:26,770
Are you serious?

4764
03:16:28,170 --> 03:16:28,690
Okay.

4765
03:16:28,730 --> 03:16:29,670
Full focus starting now.

4766
03:16:30,270 --> 03:16:31,190
Starting now.

4767
03:16:45,980 --> 03:16:55,680
Okay, here we go.

4768
03:16:55,820 --> 03:16:59,740
It starts now.

4769
03:17:00,080 --> 03:17:03,320
It starts now.

4770
03:17:06,780 --> 03:17:08,940
She just killed me.

4771
03:17:30,200 --> 03:17:32,680
Okay, here we go.

4772
03:17:36,620 --> 03:17:39,500
It hit all the other times!

4773
03:17:40,040 --> 03:17:42,460
I didn't stop hitting now!

4774
03:17:45,280 --> 03:17:47,560
All the other times it hit!

4775
03:17:50,720 --> 03:17:52,920
Oh no, how did I miss?

4776
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:54,000
Okay, focus.

4777
03:17:55,560 --> 03:17:56,760
You got this.

4778
03:17:58,120 --> 03:17:59,260
You got this.

4779
03:18:05,140 --> 03:18:05,800
Okay, nice.

4780
03:18:07,880 --> 03:18:12,600
Oh my god, are you serious?

4781
03:18:16,420 --> 03:18:17,220
No!

4782
03:18:21,330 --> 03:18:23,590
Oh, this is the worst I've ever done!

4783
03:18:28,190 --> 03:18:29,190
Come on!

4784
03:18:31,050 --> 03:18:32,070
Come on!

4785
03:18:46,240 --> 03:18:47,620
I'm freaking...

4786
03:18:47,620 --> 03:18:48,860
God, how did...

4787
03:18:48,860 --> 03:18:49,820
How did you miss?

4788
03:18:50,040 --> 03:18:50,840
Oh!

4789
03:18:52,740 --> 03:18:53,540
Oh!

4790
03:18:53,900 --> 03:18:54,700
Oh!

4791
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:54,880
Oh!

4792
03:18:55,380 --> 03:18:56,180
Oh!

4793
03:18:56,200 --> 03:18:58,980
Some people said the cloud strike is better.

4794
03:18:59,160 --> 03:19:00,580
I think it just depends on playstyle.

4795
03:19:01,200 --> 03:19:02,580
I'm more used to fire...

4796
03:19:02,580 --> 03:19:05,400
The cloud than the fire because I like the cloud more.

4797
03:19:08,680 --> 03:19:10,700
It really depends on the playstyle.

4798
03:19:11,740 --> 03:19:14,280
I saw some people were like...

4799
03:19:14,280 --> 03:19:17,120
Oh, I used the cloud for him.

4800
03:19:18,720 --> 03:19:19,240
God.

4801
03:19:20,960 --> 03:19:22,040
Oh, come on!

4802
03:19:22,080 --> 03:19:23,200
I just need to dodge!

4803
03:19:28,240 --> 03:19:28,980
Oh, sorry.

4804
03:19:29,060 --> 03:19:29,600
I'm at the freeze.

4805
03:19:29,600 --> 03:19:31,040
The immobilise.

4806
03:19:31,320 --> 03:19:32,060
I didn't mean...

4807
03:19:33,240 --> 03:19:34,940
I didn't mean the cloud.

4808
03:19:35,260 --> 03:19:36,240
I got confused.

4809
03:19:38,360 --> 03:19:41,560
But, yeah, I saw people said they used immobilise for him.

4810
03:19:44,600 --> 03:19:45,440
Okay, nice.

4811
03:19:50,980 --> 03:19:51,680
All right.

4812
03:19:51,980 --> 03:19:52,680
Come on.

4813
03:19:55,420 --> 03:19:55,980
Okay.

4814
03:20:00,170 --> 03:20:01,490
All right, immobilise!

4815
03:20:12,890 --> 03:20:14,010
Wait, what?

4816
03:20:15,090 --> 03:20:16,090
Wait, that's it?

4817
03:20:16,730 --> 03:20:22,470
What the f... Okay, I did not realize what he does.

4818
03:20:28,270 --> 03:20:31,830
Okay, now that I know what one does.

4819
03:20:32,090 --> 03:20:32,890
All right.

4820
03:20:36,670 --> 03:20:47,170
Now I know what it does guys.

4821
03:20:52,240 --> 03:20:53,180
Oh god.

4822
03:20:53,640 --> 03:20:54,300
Oh!

4823
03:20:54,520 --> 03:20:55,160
He's so strong!

4824
03:20:55,180 --> 03:20:57,160
THRUST WAS THAT LONG?!

4825
03:20:57,160 --> 03:20:58,780
What timing.

4826
03:21:01,980 --> 03:21:05,140
I know what the fucking timer is.

4827
03:21:05,140 --> 03:21:07,120
I was so confused.

4828
03:21:07,480 --> 03:21:08,780
I was like, what is he doing?

4829
03:21:08,880 --> 03:21:12,620
I thought it was like, I get activated.

4830
03:21:16,180 --> 03:21:19,320
Oh my god, I didn't realize.

4831
03:21:19,760 --> 03:21:23,060
I didn't realize that's what the move does.

4832
03:21:25,180 --> 03:21:26,300
I didn't watch the video.

4833
03:21:27,180 --> 03:21:29,390
I didn't watch the video.

4834
03:21:34,340 --> 03:21:37,120
I should have watched the video, guys.

4835
03:21:37,280 --> 03:21:38,600
I should have watched.

4836
03:21:45,230 --> 03:21:47,030
I need to just get better at dodging.

4837
03:21:47,070 --> 03:21:48,270
Just get better at dodging, Doki.

4838
03:21:48,950 --> 03:21:50,090
That's all you have to do.

4839
03:21:51,750 --> 03:21:52,670
Like, please.

4840
03:21:53,590 --> 03:21:55,130
You just need to get better at dodging.

4841
03:22:02,620 --> 03:22:04,320
What is your fucking moves?!

4842
03:22:08,760 --> 03:22:10,200
Oh my god.

4843
03:22:16,160 --> 03:22:16,840
Are

4844
03:22:27,420 --> 03:22:28,440
you serious?

4845
03:22:28,560 --> 03:22:29,000
Oh, okay.

4846
03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:36,200
Okay.

4847
03:22:37,620 --> 03:22:38,840
Oh my god, okay.

4848
03:22:43,460 --> 03:22:44,680
Okay, thank god.

4849
03:22:45,940 --> 03:22:49,200
I couldn't transform!

4850
03:22:54,540 --> 03:22:57,640
I couldn't transform in time.

4851
03:22:57,640 --> 03:23:00,200
I relied on my transformation.

4852
03:23:01,320 --> 03:23:04,820
I couldn't transform in time.

4853
03:23:10,160 --> 03:23:12,200
I can do this.

4854
03:23:12,420 --> 03:23:13,940
I can do this.

4855
03:23:14,220 --> 03:23:16,300
It's not that difficult.

4856
03:23:16,300 --> 03:23:16,720
It's not that difficult.

4857
03:23:17,020 --> 03:23:20,300
It's not that difficult.

4858
03:23:31,440 --> 03:23:33,400
He broke my freeze.

4859
03:23:33,840 --> 03:23:36,780
He broke my freeze.

4860
03:23:38,060 --> 03:23:42,640
He broke the freeze.

4861
03:23:48,360 --> 03:23:53,620
He broke the freeze.

4862
03:23:53,620 --> 03:23:54,200
The freeze!

4863
03:23:55,220 --> 03:23:58,160
What do you do when he breaks?

4864
03:23:58,200 --> 03:24:00,300
He broke the freeze!

4865
03:24:05,020 --> 03:24:05,960
Please.

4866
03:24:15,730 --> 03:24:17,550
I froze too early.

4867
03:24:17,970 --> 03:24:22,010
The game didn't register his existence.

4868
03:24:24,270 --> 03:24:28,190
The game didn't register his existence.

4869
03:24:28,190 --> 03:24:28,690
he was alive.

4870
03:24:29,150 --> 03:24:29,230
The game didn't register

4871
03:24:32,770 --> 03:24:33,510
Okay.

4872
03:24:34,990 --> 03:24:36,210
Okay, this time.

4873
03:24:36,390 --> 03:24:37,350
Full focus.

4874
03:24:37,570 --> 03:24:38,030
For real.

4875
03:24:38,750 --> 03:24:40,970
I'm gonna concentrate now.

4876
03:24:54,700 --> 03:24:55,400
Okay.

4877
03:24:56,320 --> 03:24:57,060
JK.

4878
03:24:58,130 --> 03:24:59,520
Guys, I'm not concentrating.

4879
03:24:59,820 --> 03:25:00,900
Now I am.

4880
03:25:04,720 --> 03:25:05,480
Okay.

4881
03:25:15,820 --> 03:25:16,580
Okay.

4882
03:25:16,600 --> 03:25:17,080
No!

4883
03:25:31,800 --> 03:25:32,560
Okay.

4884
03:25:44,100 --> 03:25:44,860
Okay.

4885
03:25:44,860 --> 03:25:45,620
One.

4886
03:25:46,040 --> 03:25:46,800
One.

4887
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:47,760
One.

4888
03:25:52,760 --> 03:25:53,520
Yes!

4889
03:25:53,900 --> 03:25:54,580
Goodbye!

4890
03:25:55,040 --> 03:25:56,980
I used the tiger!

4891
03:25:57,500 --> 03:25:59,360
I am the tiger!

4892
03:26:01,720 --> 03:26:03,160
Are you serious?

4893
03:26:03,320 --> 03:26:04,360
Are you fucking...

4894
03:26:11,040 --> 03:26:11,600
Are

4895
03:26:18,250 --> 03:26:19,030
you fucking...

4896
03:26:19,030 --> 03:26:19,050
Are you fucking...

4897
03:26:19,050 --> 03:26:20,330
I got the tiger though.

4898
03:26:20,710 --> 03:26:22,150
Guys, it's baby steps.

4899
03:26:22,250 --> 03:26:23,430
I caught the tiger.

4900
03:26:23,730 --> 03:26:25,270
I figured out.

4901
03:26:25,450 --> 03:26:26,270
Last try.

4902
03:26:26,610 --> 03:26:28,030
If I cannot...

4903
03:26:28,030 --> 03:26:28,970
Last try.

4904
03:26:29,050 --> 03:26:29,590
Last try.

4905
03:26:29,670 --> 03:26:31,690
And then I'll focus on leveling up.

4906
03:26:31,870 --> 03:26:34,150
If I can't do it, I'm gonna level up.

4907
03:26:34,330 --> 03:26:36,410
This is last try.

4908
03:26:36,690 --> 03:26:40,710
I think I'm just 200 level at this point.

4909
03:26:40,910 --> 03:26:44,030
I think I'm just 200 level at this point.

4910
03:26:44,030 --> 03:26:44,630
I...

4911
03:26:48,690 --> 03:26:49,910
Are

4912
03:27:00,880 --> 03:27:02,680
you serious?

4913
03:27:02,920 --> 03:27:03,960
He's... I'm stuck!

4914
03:27:09,040 --> 03:27:10,880
Oh shit!

4915
03:27:11,860 --> 03:27:12,460
Oh

4916
03:27:19,880 --> 03:27:20,880
shit!

4917
03:27:20,880 --> 03:27:21,120
Oh shit!

4918
03:27:26,660 --> 03:27:27,880
Aww.

4919
03:27:30,250 --> 03:27:32,940
He literally body blocked me!

4920
03:27:33,260 --> 03:27:35,980
He literally body blocked me!

4921
03:27:39,060 --> 03:27:40,480
Are you fucking kidding me?

4922
03:27:40,520 --> 03:27:40,780
Are you fucking kidding me?

4923
03:27:40,780 --> 03:27:40,780
Are you fucking kidding me?

4924
03:27:40,780 --> 03:27:41,280
Okay.

4925
03:27:43,520 --> 03:27:44,040
Okay.

4926
03:27:47,380 --> 03:27:47,900
Okay.

4927
03:27:48,440 --> 03:27:48,920
Okay.

4928
03:27:52,240 --> 03:27:52,760
Okay.

4929
03:27:52,760 --> 03:27:54,120
Okay, I'll just use that to dodge.

4930
03:27:54,420 --> 03:27:56,220
Okay, I'll just use that to dodge.

4931
03:27:56,220 --> 03:28:02,400
I'll just use it to dodge, I guess.

4932
03:28:02,940 --> 03:28:05,400
Like, I didn't I didn't want to do anything else, clearly.

4933
03:28:20,830 --> 03:28:21,350
Okay.

4934
03:28:52,460 --> 03:28:52,980
Nooo!

4935
03:28:52,980 --> 03:28:54,720
I jumped too early!

4936
03:28:56,060 --> 03:28:59,000
I jumped too... dodged too early!

4937
03:29:01,240 --> 03:29:02,520
Okay, one more!

4938
03:29:02,680 --> 03:29:03,040
One more!

4939
03:29:03,240 --> 03:29:04,620
I'm getting the hang of it!

4940
03:29:04,740 --> 03:29:07,620
I'm getting the hang of... I'm getting the hang of it!

4941
03:29:07,960 --> 03:29:08,720
Last one!

4942
03:29:09,400 --> 03:29:11,760
If I don't do it on this try!

4943
03:29:12,280 --> 03:29:15,140
If I don't do it on this try, I'll level up!

4944
03:29:17,260 --> 03:29:20,220
If I don't do it on this try!

4945
03:29:39,800 --> 03:29:40,720
Oh, fuck!

4946
03:29:49,340 --> 03:29:49,940
Okay.

4947
03:29:54,450 --> 03:29:55,050
Right.

4948
03:29:58,870 --> 03:29:59,990
No, fuck!

4949
03:30:06,170 --> 03:30:07,490
Are you serious?

4950
03:30:07,610 --> 03:30:08,290
That didn't work!

4951
03:30:08,310 --> 03:30:09,070
Nothing?!

4952
03:30:19,390 --> 03:30:20,110
You know what?

4953
03:30:20,150 --> 03:30:20,530
Fuck this.

4954
03:30:24,360 --> 03:30:24,630
Okay.

4955
03:30:24,790 --> 03:30:25,530
That's fine.

4956
03:30:26,210 --> 03:30:27,010
That's fine.

4957
03:30:27,130 --> 03:30:28,130
I might have messed up.

4958
03:30:30,010 --> 03:30:30,790
That's fine.

4959
03:30:33,070 --> 03:30:33,150
Okay.

4960
03:30:42,300 --> 03:30:42,910
Come on!

4961
03:30:43,650 --> 03:30:45,070
I got halfway though!

4962
03:30:46,050 --> 03:30:47,070
Oh no!

4963
03:30:50,550 --> 03:30:53,270
I got hit by every single one!

4964
03:30:56,470 --> 03:30:58,210
Oh no, not this one.

4965
03:30:58,310 --> 03:30:59,270
Not this one!

4966
03:31:01,350 --> 03:31:02,010
Okay.

4967
03:31:02,350 --> 03:31:03,010
No.

4968
03:31:03,810 --> 03:31:04,470
No.

4969
03:31:05,830 --> 03:31:06,490
No.

4970
03:31:08,810 --> 03:31:09,470
Oh.

4971
03:31:10,320 --> 03:31:10,650
Okay.

4972
03:31:19,080 --> 03:31:19,740
No.

4973
03:31:21,720 --> 03:31:22,380
No!

4974
03:31:22,460 --> 03:31:22,640
Okay.

4975
03:31:23,320 --> 03:31:23,980
That

4976
03:31:44,070 --> 03:31:44,430
was the end!

4977
03:31:44,870 --> 03:31:46,170
That was the end, you bitch!

4978
03:31:47,290 --> 03:31:47,830
Okay.

4979
03:31:48,490 --> 03:31:50,450
Oh, come on!

4980
03:31:53,030 --> 03:31:54,130
Oh my god!

4981
03:31:54,390 --> 03:31:58,010
What the...

4982
03:32:00,750 --> 03:32:01,550
Okay.

4983
03:32:06,700 --> 03:32:07,500
Okay!

4984
03:32:08,880 --> 03:32:11,720
That's what I call a bullshit move.

4985
03:32:15,500 --> 03:32:17,780
You're so fucking bullshit.

4986
03:32:19,060 --> 03:32:20,920
Oh my god!

4987
03:32:20,980 --> 03:32:21,560
One more!

4988
03:32:21,680 --> 03:32:22,140
One more!

4989
03:32:22,200 --> 03:32:22,840
I'm getting better!

4990
03:32:22,840 --> 03:32:25,120
I'm getting better.

4991
03:32:26,740 --> 03:32:27,700
I'm getting better.

4992
03:32:27,700 --> 03:32:28,300
I'm actually getting better.

4993
03:32:28,420 --> 03:32:30,160
I'm locked in.

4994
03:32:31,560 --> 03:32:32,900
I'm locked in.

4995
03:32:32,940 --> 03:32:33,920
I'm locked in now.

4996
03:32:34,560 --> 03:32:35,740
Oh my god.

4997
03:32:36,360 --> 03:32:38,400
I'm actually locked in.

4998
03:32:40,600 --> 03:32:42,500
I'm locked in.

4999
03:32:45,060 --> 03:32:46,300
Oh shit.

5000
03:32:46,340 --> 03:32:47,920
I'm so locked in.

5001
03:32:47,920 --> 03:32:47,920
Oh shit.

5002
03:32:50,340 --> 03:32:50,860
Okay.

5003
03:32:52,340 --> 03:32:54,300
I'm so fucking locked in.

5004
03:32:54,780 --> 03:32:55,740
Oh my god.

5005
03:33:26,890 --> 03:33:27,930
No way!

5006
03:33:28,370 --> 03:33:29,610
I time mistimed!

5007
03:33:29,610 --> 03:33:31,010
Okay, we're not leveling up.

5008
03:33:31,070 --> 03:33:31,610
We're beating him.

5009
03:33:31,750 --> 03:33:33,150
I mistimed it!

5010
03:33:33,270 --> 03:33:34,990
I mistimed the dodge!

5011
03:33:35,590 --> 03:33:36,750
We're not leveling up.

5012
03:33:41,850 --> 03:33:43,630
I mistimed the dodges.

5013
03:33:43,790 --> 03:33:44,570
I like understand.

5014
03:33:46,690 --> 03:33:53,050
I cannot... I literally just know I will not... I got the strat.

5015
03:33:53,150 --> 03:33:54,130
I got the strat now.

5016
03:33:56,130 --> 03:33:57,230
We can kill him.

5017
03:33:57,290 --> 03:33:58,790
We don't need a level up.

5018
03:34:01,010 --> 03:34:02,390
We don't need to.

5019
03:34:02,550 --> 03:34:04,570
I don't care if I'm under level.

5020
03:34:05,590 --> 03:34:06,030
I'm a gamer!

5021
03:34:11,460 --> 03:34:12,180
Okay.

5022
03:34:13,640 --> 03:34:14,360
Okay.

5023
03:34:24,120 --> 03:34:24,840
No!

5024
03:34:24,960 --> 03:34:25,440
Fuck!

5025
03:34:25,500 --> 03:34:25,780
Okay.

5026
03:34:25,900 --> 03:34:26,680
That's fine.

5027
03:34:28,520 --> 03:34:29,600
That's not fine.

5028
03:34:30,560 --> 03:34:31,760
That's not fine.

5029
03:34:34,580 --> 03:34:36,040
Oh my god!

5030
03:34:36,140 --> 03:34:37,600
I'm getting mistimed!

5031
03:34:38,420 --> 03:34:40,680
I'm mistiming my dodges!

5032
03:34:41,820 --> 03:34:43,920
Gamers never give up!

5033
03:34:53,120 --> 03:34:54,000
My timing!

5034
03:34:54,820 --> 03:34:56,660
But I know I can kill him.

5035
03:34:56,720 --> 03:34:58,480
I know I can kill him with the level I'm at.

5036
03:34:59,480 --> 03:35:00,980
I know I can kill him.

5037
03:35:01,120 --> 03:35:02,240
Don't give up!

5038
03:35:02,280 --> 03:35:03,500
We're not giving up!

5039
03:35:04,800 --> 03:35:05,460
I know.

5040
03:35:08,220 --> 03:35:09,720
I know I can beat him.

5041
03:35:09,780 --> 03:35:10,220
That's the thing.

5042
03:35:13,920 --> 03:35:14,840
Okay, new strats.

5043
03:35:25,510 --> 03:35:26,270
Yeah.

5044
03:35:31,710 --> 03:35:32,470
Okay.

5045
03:35:42,230 --> 03:35:43,010
Oh no!

5046
03:35:59,280 --> 03:36:00,340
Come on!

5047
03:36:00,860 --> 03:36:01,620
Literally!

5048
03:36:01,800 --> 03:36:02,320
Yes!

5049
03:36:03,380 --> 03:36:04,140
Okay.

5050
03:36:07,400 --> 03:36:08,520
Come on!

5051
03:36:09,840 --> 03:36:10,600
Okay.

5052
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:11,540
I can't...

5053
03:36:12,380 --> 03:36:13,140
Okay.

5054
03:36:13,260 --> 03:36:13,600
That's fine.

5055
03:36:14,800 --> 03:36:15,740
That's fine.

5056
03:36:15,980 --> 03:36:17,280
Now we...

5057
03:36:18,500 --> 03:36:19,260
Okay.

5058
03:36:19,340 --> 03:36:20,240
That's not fine.

5059
03:36:21,420 --> 03:36:23,780
That's not fine at all.

5060
03:36:25,000 --> 03:36:29,440
We haven't mastered Tiger Form yet, guys.

5061
03:36:30,500 --> 03:36:35,040
We still need experience with Tiger Form.

5062
03:36:37,960 --> 03:36:39,000
That's fine.

5063
03:36:40,680 --> 03:36:42,160
We're still learning.

5064
03:36:43,560 --> 03:36:45,260
We're still learning.

5065
03:36:48,060 --> 03:36:48,580
Okay.

5066
03:37:05,470 --> 03:37:06,870
Are you serious?

5067
03:37:08,890 --> 03:37:09,410
Okay.

5068
03:37:09,550 --> 03:37:10,290
I dodged that.

5069
03:37:13,620 --> 03:37:14,480
Come on.

5070
03:37:19,470 --> 03:37:21,850
What the fuck did I just do there?

5071
03:37:24,350 --> 03:37:25,610
Oh my god!

5072
03:37:25,690 --> 03:37:26,470
I was like, what?

5073
03:37:26,650 --> 03:37:27,990
I've never seen this move before!

5074
03:37:31,070 --> 03:37:31,590
No!

5075
03:37:31,990 --> 03:37:32,510
No!

5076
03:37:36,000 --> 03:37:37,440
What was that?

5077
03:37:37,480 --> 03:37:39,260
I didn't even know how I did that combo!

5078
03:37:39,860 --> 03:37:41,460
It just happened!

5079
03:37:41,700 --> 03:37:43,260
I was pole dancing!

5080
03:37:44,200 --> 03:37:46,060
True, I was pole dancing!

5081
03:37:47,040 --> 03:37:51,000
Oh my god, this trip will not end until I defeat this stupid dragon!

5082
03:37:52,280 --> 03:37:53,780
Don't ever give up!

5083
03:37:54,040 --> 03:37:55,960
I will not level up!

5084
03:37:56,240 --> 03:37:57,300
I will not!

5085
03:37:57,920 --> 03:37:59,800
Leveling up is for pussies!

5086
03:38:04,840 --> 03:38:04,880
Okay.

5087
03:38:09,080 --> 03:38:09,660
Alright.

5088
03:38:10,600 --> 03:38:11,180
No!

5089
03:38:12,520 --> 03:38:14,060
I can defeat him!

5090
03:38:18,460 --> 03:38:19,620
I'm gaming!

5091
03:38:19,860 --> 03:38:20,760
Fucking gaming!

5092
03:38:20,940 --> 03:38:21,160
Okay.

5093
03:38:25,790 --> 03:38:26,370
Okay.

5094
03:38:26,450 --> 03:38:28,250
I need to remember all his combos, though.

5095
03:38:34,430 --> 03:38:35,010
Okay.

5096
03:38:35,270 --> 03:38:36,310
That does that.

5097
03:38:36,450 --> 03:38:36,850
No!

5098
03:38:36,950 --> 03:38:38,150
I forgot this one!

5099
03:38:41,890 --> 03:38:42,470
No!

5100
03:38:42,870 --> 03:38:44,430
I forgot the combos!

5101
03:38:44,710 --> 03:38:45,030
No!

5102
03:38:45,030 --> 03:38:45,030
I forgot the combos!

5103
03:38:50,680 --> 03:38:52,000
I lost the combos!

5104
03:38:53,020 --> 03:38:54,740
I lost the combos!

5105
03:38:54,940 --> 03:38:56,760
You lost the combos for me!

5106
03:38:59,200 --> 03:39:01,620
They lost the combo timing!

5107
03:39:10,980 --> 03:39:11,780
This is it!

5108
03:39:11,840 --> 03:39:12,200
This is it!

5109
03:39:12,300 --> 03:39:13,400
I will figure this out!

5110
03:39:15,920 --> 03:39:18,800
Alright, what if I do use... Okay, I'm gonna try the clones.

5111
03:39:20,740 --> 03:39:21,660
Clones, go!

5112
03:39:21,840 --> 03:39:22,600
Monkey, go!

5113
03:39:25,660 --> 03:39:26,620
Go, monkey!

5114
03:39:27,480 --> 03:39:28,780
Go, monkey, go!

5115
03:39:29,040 --> 03:39:30,360
Go, monkey, go!

5116
03:39:30,600 --> 03:39:32,100
Go, monkey, go!

5117
03:39:33,900 --> 03:39:35,780
Monkeys, keep going, monkeys!

5118
03:39:36,840 --> 03:39:38,700
He can't kill all of us!

5119
03:39:41,180 --> 03:39:41,780
Jeez!

5120
03:39:46,950 --> 03:39:48,550
All my monkeys are dead.

5121
03:39:50,210 --> 03:39:52,050
All my monkeys are dead.

5122
03:39:52,170 --> 03:39:52,330
Okay.

5123
03:39:53,330 --> 03:39:54,950
Alright, we tried the monkey...

5124
03:39:54,950 --> 03:39:57,130
I don't know if the monkey strat was good.

5125
03:39:57,470 --> 03:39:58,550
I still don't know.

5126
03:39:59,470 --> 03:39:59,990
Okay.

5127
03:40:03,290 --> 03:40:03,810
Okay.

5128
03:40:07,790 --> 03:40:08,830
Oh, what?!

5129
03:40:10,850 --> 03:40:11,370
Okay.

5130
03:40:15,550 --> 03:40:16,070
Okay.

5131
03:40:18,390 --> 03:40:18,910
Alright.

5132
03:40:20,890 --> 03:40:21,410
Immobilize!

5133
03:40:25,590 --> 03:40:26,010
Please!

5134
03:40:26,910 --> 03:40:27,330
Please!

5135
03:40:27,530 --> 03:40:28,650
We're so close!

5136
03:40:32,730 --> 03:40:33,770
We're so close!

5137
03:40:33,970 --> 03:40:34,650
Oh, transport, transport!

5138
03:40:36,350 --> 03:40:37,510
I figured it out now.

5139
03:40:38,610 --> 03:40:39,450
This is fine.

5140
03:40:41,610 --> 03:40:42,730
Oh, this is not fine.

5141
03:40:44,690 --> 03:40:45,550
It's not fine.

5142
03:40:47,110 --> 03:40:48,090
This is not fine.

5143
03:40:48,190 --> 03:40:49,270
He has the final hit!

5144
03:40:49,410 --> 03:40:49,770
Oh!

5145
03:40:54,800 --> 03:40:55,220
Okay.

5146
03:40:56,060 --> 03:40:56,480
Okay.

5147
03:41:05,220 --> 03:41:05,640
Okay.

5148
03:41:05,640 --> 03:41:05,860
Okay.

5149
03:41:06,460 --> 03:41:06,900
No!

5150
03:41:07,040 --> 03:41:07,960
I forgot that!

5151
03:41:17,200 --> 03:41:17,640
No!

5152
03:41:18,140 --> 03:41:19,020
Get away from me!

5153
03:41:28,850 --> 03:41:29,290
Okay.

5154
03:41:29,290 --> 03:41:30,830
Oh, that was my last magic.

5155
03:41:31,190 --> 03:41:32,770
Guys, that was my last magic.

5156
03:41:39,360 --> 03:41:39,800
Swing!

5157
03:41:48,830 --> 03:41:49,270
No!

5158
03:41:49,790 --> 03:41:50,710
Get away from me!

5159
03:41:51,870 --> 03:41:52,510
Get away!

5160
03:41:56,650 --> 03:41:57,250
Get away!

5161
03:41:57,370 --> 03:41:57,590
No!

5162
03:41:58,830 --> 03:41:59,270
Swing!

5163
03:42:01,310 --> 03:42:02,910
Get away!

5164
03:42:02,910 --> 03:42:02,910
Get away!

5165
03:42:05,350 --> 03:42:07,810
He wouldn't get away!

5166
03:42:08,370 --> 03:42:11,670
He wouldn't get away from me!

5167
03:42:15,810 --> 03:42:19,210
He wouldn't get away from me!

5168
03:42:22,410 --> 03:42:23,310
Bro!

5169
03:42:23,310 --> 03:42:26,670
He fucking... oh my god!

5170
03:42:26,810 --> 03:42:28,470
He just kept running!

5171
03:42:30,180 --> 03:42:30,950
Monkeys go.

5172
03:42:32,410 --> 03:42:33,450
Monkeys go!

5173
03:42:33,750 --> 03:42:35,230
We're going for him!

5174
03:42:36,850 --> 03:42:37,850
Monkeys attack!

5175
03:42:49,080 --> 03:42:49,860
Oh god.

5176
03:42:53,690 --> 03:42:55,330
Never back down!

5177
03:42:55,430 --> 03:42:55,650
Never!

5178
03:42:57,670 --> 03:42:58,550
Oh god.

5179
03:43:01,190 --> 03:43:01,830
Okay.

5180
03:43:06,800 --> 03:43:08,520
What the fuck?

5181
03:43:08,640 --> 03:43:08,960
Okay.

5182
03:43:09,100 --> 03:43:10,080
That's not fair.

5183
03:43:10,160 --> 03:43:10,940
He put me in a corner.

5184
03:43:11,180 --> 03:43:13,280
He put me in a fucking corner!

5185
03:43:20,210 --> 03:43:21,450
Oh my god.

5186
03:43:26,840 --> 03:43:27,520
Okay.

5187
03:43:27,600 --> 03:43:28,020
Nice.

5188
03:43:28,900 --> 03:43:29,580
Clown.

5189
03:43:39,020 --> 03:43:39,700
Oh!

5190
03:43:39,700 --> 03:43:41,800
This is where I die!

5191
03:43:42,760 --> 03:43:44,660
This might be where I die!

5192
03:43:45,280 --> 03:43:47,700
I couldn't dress for him this time!

5193
03:43:47,900 --> 03:43:52,260
I feel... I will be so much determination!

5194
03:43:53,240 --> 03:43:54,440
Too greedy.

5195
03:43:57,860 --> 03:43:59,320
Oh my god.

5196
03:44:02,740 --> 03:44:04,380
Charge attack while invisible?

5197
03:44:04,720 --> 03:44:05,040
Okay.

5198
03:44:05,140 --> 03:44:05,700
We'll try that.

5199
03:44:08,080 --> 03:44:08,740
Okay.

5200
03:44:09,000 --> 03:44:09,660
Okay.

5201
03:44:11,880 --> 03:44:13,040
Go, monkeys!

5202
03:44:13,180 --> 03:44:13,480
Go!

5203
03:44:14,560 --> 03:44:15,640
Go, monkeys!

5204
03:44:16,360 --> 03:44:17,420
Go, monkeys!

5205
03:44:17,540 --> 03:44:17,780
Go!

5206
03:44:19,240 --> 03:44:20,960
We can do this, monkeys!

5207
03:44:21,660 --> 03:44:23,000
Apes together strong!

5208
03:44:23,300 --> 03:44:24,800
Apes together strong!

5209
03:44:25,900 --> 03:44:28,140
Apes together so strong!

5210
03:44:29,020 --> 03:44:31,140
Oh, I can't charge.

5211
03:44:31,320 --> 03:44:33,300
I can't charge.

5212
03:44:33,320 --> 03:44:33,920
I can't charge.

5213
03:44:33,920 --> 03:44:34,740
I can't charge.

5214
03:44:35,620 --> 03:44:39,560
Guys, for those who are wondering why I don't charge my attacks afterwards...

5215
03:44:39,560 --> 03:44:40,900
Because I can't.

5216
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:45,560
Okay.

5217
03:44:46,440 --> 03:44:47,300
Okay, nice.

5218
03:44:47,400 --> 03:44:49,240
Oh, not nice!

5219
03:44:49,320 --> 03:44:49,800
Not nice!

5220
03:44:49,860 --> 03:44:50,280
Not nice!

5221
03:44:57,360 --> 03:44:57,920
Okay.

5222
03:44:58,800 --> 03:44:59,360
Okay.

5223
03:45:00,560 --> 03:45:01,120
Okay.

5224
03:45:01,380 --> 03:45:01,580
Okay.

5225
03:45:01,740 --> 03:45:02,300
Okay.

5226
03:45:03,560 --> 03:45:04,120
Okay.

5227
03:45:04,260 --> 03:45:10,060
Oh, he should be about 15 years old.

5228
03:45:10,060 --> 03:45:10,340
Okay, we can charge now.

5229
03:45:10,600 --> 03:45:11,160
Awesome...

5230
03:45:11,160 --> 03:45:11,520
So, for done!

5231
03:45:11,860 --> 03:45:12,300
Let's bond with mon apartheid!

5232
03:45:22,300 --> 03:45:23,420
Wow, Takara!

5233
03:45:23,600 --> 03:45:25,280
Well done to you!

5234
03:45:25,280 --> 03:45:25,480
Why doesn't he do anything yet?

5235
03:45:25,700 --> 03:45:26,160
온다운!

5236
03:45:27,600 --> 03:45:29,620
Okay, goodbye wolf.

5237
03:45:30,600 --> 03:45:31,800
Goodbye tiger.

5238
03:45:33,520 --> 03:45:35,600
Okay, okay.

5239
03:45:36,840 --> 03:45:38,500
Tiger could not live.

5240
03:45:40,380 --> 03:45:43,020
Tiger, tiger had its fun.

5241
03:45:50,980 --> 03:45:54,640
I tried to block it before, but it wouldn't block.

5242
03:45:54,640 --> 03:45:56,080
I don't know.

5243
03:45:56,160 --> 03:45:58,120
Can I actually block that as tiger?

5244
03:45:58,320 --> 03:45:59,300
Did it just not work?

5245
03:46:06,320 --> 03:46:07,060
Charging up.

5246
03:46:07,120 --> 03:46:07,740
Wait, I can?

5247
03:46:08,120 --> 03:46:09,820
Guys, why didn't you tell me this?

5248
03:46:10,100 --> 03:46:11,940
Wait, I can cancel it?

5249
03:46:12,200 --> 03:46:14,500
I can cancel it, guys?

5250
03:46:14,880 --> 03:46:16,240
What do you mean?

5251
03:46:17,060 --> 03:46:19,780
I could have cancelled this entire time.

5252
03:46:21,960 --> 03:46:23,300
Now I know.

5253
03:46:24,120 --> 03:46:25,680
Now I know.

5254
03:46:30,100 --> 03:46:30,700
Okay.

5255
03:46:33,540 --> 03:46:35,360
Alright, now I know though.

5256
03:46:35,720 --> 03:46:36,540
That's good.

5257
03:46:39,880 --> 03:46:40,480
Alright.

5258
03:46:44,250 --> 03:46:45,330
I didn't know!

5259
03:46:45,670 --> 03:46:46,770
I didn't know!

5260
03:46:47,390 --> 03:46:48,330
I'm stupid!

5261
03:46:48,810 --> 03:46:50,570
I play video games for a living!

5262
03:46:57,610 --> 03:46:59,370
Are you serious?

5263
03:46:59,370 --> 03:46:59,870
Stop!

5264
03:47:04,630 --> 03:47:06,050
Oh my god.

5265
03:47:11,580 --> 03:47:12,320
Okay, freeze.

5266
03:47:15,120 --> 03:47:16,060
Come on!

5267
03:47:16,100 --> 03:47:17,320
I just need one more hit!

5268
03:47:19,200 --> 03:47:19,740
Yes!

5269
03:47:19,740 --> 03:47:20,000
Yes!

5270
03:47:20,080 --> 03:47:20,280
Okay!

5271
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:22,120
Okay, do the charge up.

5272
03:47:22,580 --> 03:47:23,680
Do the charge up!

5273
03:47:27,280 --> 03:47:27,820
Yes!

5274
03:47:32,900 --> 03:47:33,960
That's fucking right.

5275
03:47:34,120 --> 03:47:34,880
That's right!

5276
03:47:35,800 --> 03:47:36,600
That's right!

5277
03:47:36,900 --> 03:47:37,440
Boom!

5278
03:47:37,520 --> 03:47:38,020
Slash!

5279
03:47:38,020 --> 03:47:38,500
Slash!

5280
03:47:38,600 --> 03:47:38,920
Slash!

5281
03:47:39,380 --> 03:47:40,080
Slash!

5282
03:47:40,120 --> 03:47:40,720
Slash!

5283
03:47:41,080 --> 03:47:41,780
Slash!

5284
03:47:42,100 --> 03:47:42,800
Slash!

5285
03:47:42,820 --> 03:47:43,160
Slash!

5286
03:47:43,240 --> 03:47:43,520
Slash!

5287
03:48:08,730 --> 03:48:09,430
Slash!

5288
03:48:09,430 --> 03:48:09,810
Go down!

5289
03:48:20,000 --> 03:48:22,040
Oh no, wait!

5290
03:48:22,100 --> 03:48:23,620
He gets another one!

5291
03:48:43,330 --> 03:48:45,110
Oh my god!

5292
03:48:48,330 --> 03:48:51,990
Oh my god, how did you get to do it again?

5293
03:48:55,430 --> 03:48:57,590
I can't believe it.

5294
03:48:57,690 --> 03:48:58,850
That's illegal.

5295
03:48:59,370 --> 03:49:00,470
That should be illegal.

5296
03:49:04,390 --> 03:49:04,870
Monkeys.

5297
03:49:08,210 --> 03:49:09,570
We'll figure out the system.

5298
03:49:27,500 --> 03:49:28,460
Oh no!

5299
03:49:35,170 --> 03:49:36,850
Oh, I forgot that move!

5300
03:49:36,990 --> 03:49:37,670
I forgot it does that!

5301
03:49:37,990 --> 03:49:39,090
I forgot it does that!

5302
03:49:43,260 --> 03:49:43,740
Okay.

5303
03:49:44,320 --> 03:49:44,800
What?!

5304
03:49:44,800 --> 03:49:46,620
What is that range?!

5305
03:49:50,850 --> 03:49:51,330
Okay.

5306
03:49:53,410 --> 03:49:53,930
Okay.

5307
03:49:57,190 --> 03:49:58,170
I missed.

5308
03:49:58,290 --> 03:49:58,470
How?

5309
03:49:58,770 --> 03:49:59,990
How did I miss that?

5310
03:50:00,130 --> 03:50:01,510
How did I miss that?!

5311
03:50:01,510 --> 03:50:02,430
How?!

5312
03:50:03,190 --> 03:50:04,050
This is bullshit!

5313
03:50:06,630 --> 03:50:08,010
Use your electricity, bitch.

5314
03:50:08,530 --> 03:50:09,690
You know you want to.

5315
03:50:09,850 --> 03:50:11,110
You know you want to.

5316
03:50:11,350 --> 03:50:12,450
I'm saving it.

5317
03:50:13,550 --> 03:50:15,310
Oh, that hits me?!

5318
03:50:17,730 --> 03:50:18,650
Boom!

5319
03:50:22,610 --> 03:50:23,810
That's fucking right.

5320
03:50:24,130 --> 03:50:24,930
Wait, what?

5321
03:50:25,770 --> 03:50:26,110
Wait, where?

5322
03:50:27,510 --> 03:50:28,390
What happened to...

5323
03:50:28,390 --> 03:50:29,130
Oh, there it is.

5324
03:50:29,290 --> 03:50:31,910
I was gonna say, what happened to wind power?

5325
03:50:32,170 --> 03:50:33,150
What happened?

5326
03:50:36,930 --> 03:50:37,530
Fine.

5327
03:50:39,490 --> 03:50:40,010
That's fine.

5328
03:50:51,540 --> 03:50:52,200
Come on.

5329
03:51:00,640 --> 03:51:01,240
Okay.

5330
03:51:08,380 --> 03:51:10,480
Are you serious?!

5331
03:51:15,170 --> 03:51:15,770
Okay.

5332
03:51:15,770 --> 03:51:15,890
Okay.

5333
03:51:23,060 --> 03:51:23,430
Oh.

5334
03:51:27,730 --> 03:51:28,470
Okay.

5335
03:51:28,470 --> 03:51:28,770
Oh my god.

5336
03:51:31,050 --> 03:51:31,790
Okay.

5337
03:51:36,330 --> 03:51:37,070
No!

5338
03:51:38,870 --> 03:51:39,610
Okay.

5339
03:51:40,450 --> 03:51:41,190
Oh

5340
03:51:44,860 --> 03:51:45,460
no!

5341
03:51:45,600 --> 03:51:46,080
No!

5342
03:51:46,540 --> 03:51:47,060
No!

5343
03:51:52,560 --> 03:51:53,560
Oh, okay.

5344
03:51:54,500 --> 03:51:55,600
We'll go full.

5345
03:52:00,860 --> 03:52:02,900
I know he has one more move there.

5346
03:52:03,160 --> 03:52:03,900
Okay.

5347
03:52:04,140 --> 03:52:04,880
Okay.

5348
03:52:06,460 --> 03:52:07,140
Okay.

5349
03:52:07,140 --> 03:52:08,280
And another!

5350
03:52:23,720 --> 03:52:24,400
Okay.

5351
03:52:36,920 --> 03:52:38,160
No, I don't have Roller.

5352
03:52:38,180 --> 03:52:39,060
I don't have Roller!

5353
03:52:39,080 --> 03:52:39,280
Oh!

5354
03:52:50,620 --> 03:52:51,300
Okay.

5355
03:52:55,160 --> 03:52:55,840
What?!

5356
03:52:58,460 --> 03:52:59,700
I'm so sad.

5357
03:53:00,960 --> 03:53:02,320
I'm so sad.

5358
03:53:02,560 --> 03:53:03,980
I'm so sad.

5359
03:53:05,140 --> 03:53:07,060
That's actually bullshit.

5360
03:53:09,000 --> 03:53:11,500
Oh my god!

5361
03:53:12,860 --> 03:53:15,520
That's actually so bullshit!

5362
03:53:16,180 --> 03:53:21,980
I'm so... I'm doing so well!

5363
03:53:32,520 --> 03:53:35,900
I didn't even realize I had Overheal!

5364
03:53:36,220 --> 03:53:37,480
I was so close!

5365
03:53:37,780 --> 03:53:39,500
I got grabbed!

5366
03:53:39,680 --> 03:53:41,200
I didn't even thought...

5367
03:53:41,200 --> 03:53:42,640
We were so...

5368
03:53:43,420 --> 03:53:45,740
I had one Overheal!

5369
03:53:47,860 --> 03:53:49,860
Oh my god!

5370
03:53:49,960 --> 03:53:51,440
I had one Overheal!

5371
03:53:53,100 --> 03:53:54,080
Oh yeah!

5372
03:53:54,140 --> 03:53:55,020
That was so close!

5373
03:53:55,140 --> 03:53:58,420
I had... That's like the closest I've ever done to...

5374
03:54:10,440 --> 03:54:12,440
I'm like losing track of all the monkeys.

5375
03:54:12,580 --> 03:54:13,640
There's so many monkeys.

5376
03:54:14,520 --> 03:54:16,060
I'm losing track of them.

5377
03:54:19,540 --> 03:54:20,000
No!

5378
03:54:22,840 --> 03:54:23,300
Okay...

5379
03:54:23,300 --> 03:54:25,740
Fun is not the right word I would describe this boss.

5380
03:54:28,940 --> 03:54:29,400
Fun...

5381
03:54:29,400 --> 03:54:32,280
Fun is absolutely not the right word right now.

5382
03:54:33,960 --> 03:54:34,800
Oh my god.

5383
03:54:34,820 --> 03:54:36,200
I'm not doing well for this run.

5384
03:54:36,460 --> 03:54:38,600
This run I'm actually fumbling a lot.

5385
03:54:42,160 --> 03:54:43,720
I'm fumbling a lot with this one.

5386
03:54:53,220 --> 03:54:55,240
Oh no!

5387
03:55:00,220 --> 03:55:02,900
I'm so sad!

5388
03:55:02,960 --> 03:55:05,120
If he didn't command grab me!

5389
03:55:05,340 --> 03:55:06,980
If he didn't!

5390
03:55:08,460 --> 03:55:12,540
If he didn't command grab me!

5391
03:55:12,800 --> 03:55:15,420
Oh my god!

5392
03:55:16,120 --> 03:55:17,660
The command grab!

5393
03:55:19,520 --> 03:55:23,600
The command grab was what fucked me up!

5394
03:55:24,440 --> 03:55:25,560
Okay, this is it.

5395
03:55:26,080 --> 03:55:29,380
This might not be it, but like, I'm coping.

5396
03:55:30,460 --> 03:55:37,240
This might not be it, I'm just coping at this point.

5397
03:55:43,640 --> 03:55:44,680
Oh, what?

5398
03:55:44,840 --> 03:55:46,440
There's too many monkeys!

5399
03:55:46,480 --> 03:55:49,420
I can't see where I am!

5400
03:55:52,980 --> 03:55:53,700
Oh.

5401
03:55:53,700 --> 03:55:54,420
Okay.

5402
03:55:59,970 --> 03:56:00,690
Okay.

5403
03:56:04,630 --> 03:56:05,350
Okay.

5404
03:56:10,600 --> 03:56:11,320
Alright.

5405
03:56:20,570 --> 03:56:21,290
Okay.

5406
03:56:21,450 --> 03:56:21,590
Okay.

5407
03:56:22,790 --> 03:56:23,350
Come on.

5408
03:56:27,640 --> 03:56:28,800
Are you serious?

5409
03:56:36,970 --> 03:56:37,470
Come on.

5410
03:56:38,030 --> 03:56:39,970
Oh my god, you bitch!

5411
03:56:41,990 --> 03:56:42,470
Are you?

5412
03:56:42,550 --> 03:56:43,090
Okay, whatever.

5413
03:56:43,270 --> 03:56:43,570
Whatever.

5414
03:56:43,730 --> 03:56:43,930
Whatever.

5415
03:56:43,990 --> 03:56:44,170
Whatever.

5416
03:56:44,230 --> 03:56:44,910
We're gonna do this.

5417
03:56:46,470 --> 03:56:47,250
We're gonna do this.

5418
03:56:47,330 --> 03:56:47,690
It's fine.

5419
03:56:49,970 --> 03:56:50,490
It's fine.

5420
03:56:50,590 --> 03:56:51,450
This is not the run.

5421
03:56:51,670 --> 03:56:52,270
It's fine.

5422
03:56:52,330 --> 03:56:53,230
This was just not the run.

5423
03:56:55,450 --> 03:56:55,990
It's fine.

5424
03:56:56,050 --> 03:56:57,650
This was just not the run!

5425
03:56:57,650 --> 03:57:00,030
This is not the run!

5426
03:57:03,600 --> 03:57:05,400
This was just not the run.

5427
03:57:07,140 --> 03:57:08,240
The timing!

5428
03:57:08,260 --> 03:57:11,020
I freeze the exact moment he does the thing!

5429
03:57:13,120 --> 03:57:15,860
I freeze the moment he does it.

5430
03:57:15,900 --> 03:57:17,240
That's like the most tempting part.

5431
03:57:20,700 --> 03:57:24,540
When we, when we both looked at each other and we both freeze.

5432
03:57:28,680 --> 03:57:29,800
It's just not the run.

5433
03:57:30,520 --> 03:57:32,140
It's just not the run.

5434
03:57:32,700 --> 03:57:34,100
We will find the run!

5435
03:57:34,580 --> 03:57:36,500
We will figure out which was the run!

5436
03:57:38,560 --> 03:57:39,360
Aight, okay.

5437
03:57:40,100 --> 03:57:40,960
Aight, okay.

5438
03:57:41,340 --> 03:57:46,180
Our monkeys, our monkeys transported the- transported him somewhere else.

5439
03:57:46,380 --> 03:57:47,240
But that's okay.

5440
03:57:52,180 --> 03:57:52,960
That's fine.

5441
03:57:58,410 --> 03:57:58,970
Okay.

5442
03:58:02,620 --> 03:58:03,800
Oh, come on!

5443
03:58:04,160 --> 03:58:04,720
I thought you were gonna-

5444
03:58:09,360 --> 03:58:09,980
What?

5445
03:58:14,140 --> 03:58:14,940
That hits me?

5446
03:58:15,200 --> 03:58:16,360
You bitch!

5447
03:58:26,280 --> 03:58:31,700
I just want to make sure he doesn't do the electricity.

5448
03:58:32,000 --> 03:58:32,640
Oh no!

5449
03:58:32,840 --> 03:58:36,000
He doesn't do the electricity, but he does something else!

5450
03:58:36,000 --> 03:58:37,980
He hits me!

5451
03:58:43,050 --> 03:58:45,470
I command thee to stop!

5452
03:58:47,730 --> 03:58:48,490
Okay.

5453
03:58:48,670 --> 03:58:50,250
He does one more move.

5454
03:58:50,650 --> 03:58:52,390
And he does one more...

5455
03:59:02,320 --> 03:59:03,080
Nice.

5456
03:59:03,080 --> 03:59:04,300
Oh no!

5457
03:59:07,980 --> 03:59:08,740
No!

5458
03:59:13,560 --> 03:59:14,960
Oh no, not again.

5459
03:59:15,080 --> 03:59:15,880
Not again!

5460
03:59:18,060 --> 03:59:18,820
No!

5461
03:59:18,820 --> 03:59:20,280
I'm just going to be Tiger!

5462
03:59:20,920 --> 03:59:22,180
I want to live!

5463
03:59:22,700 --> 03:59:24,000
I want to live!

5464
03:59:25,540 --> 03:59:27,180
I can't block it!

5465
03:59:27,380 --> 03:59:28,920
I can't block it!

5466
03:59:33,600 --> 03:59:34,720
I want to live!

5467
03:59:34,800 --> 03:59:35,600
I want to live!

5468
03:59:40,160 --> 03:59:40,760
Okay.

5469
03:59:40,760 --> 03:59:41,580
That's fine.

5470
03:59:47,310 --> 03:59:47,910
Okay.

5471
03:59:51,300 --> 03:59:51,900
Okay.

5472
03:59:53,440 --> 03:59:54,040
What?

5473
03:59:54,420 --> 03:59:55,440
This is bullshit.

5474
03:59:57,820 --> 03:59:58,560
We

5475
04:00:05,200 --> 04:00:06,340
both use Cloud Step!

5476
04:00:09,000 --> 04:00:12,180
The fact that we both use Cloud Step!

5477
04:00:21,500 --> 04:00:22,240
Here.

5478
04:00:26,130 --> 04:00:26,870
Here.

5479
04:00:30,370 --> 04:00:31,390
Big baby!

5480
04:00:34,800 --> 04:00:35,170
Okay.

5481
04:00:41,240 --> 04:00:41,980
Okay.

5482
04:00:43,240 --> 04:00:43,720
Oh...

5483
04:00:57,920 --> 04:00:59,940
How do you still...?

5484
04:01:04,520 --> 04:01:05,480
Oh... Again!

5485
04:01:08,320 --> 04:01:09,220
Oh my god.

5486
04:01:12,840 --> 04:01:15,000
I thought he... I said he was going to use this...

5487
04:01:15,000 --> 04:01:16,720
I thought he was going to use it twice!

5488
04:01:17,560 --> 04:01:18,680
I couldn't hear!

5489
04:01:19,900 --> 04:01:20,380
I...

5490
04:01:35,900 --> 04:01:43,920
Sometimes twice, sometimes three... if it takes too long.

5491
04:01:44,220 --> 04:01:46,200
Oh my god.

5492
04:01:46,420 --> 04:01:49,160
Oh my god, bro.

5493
04:01:52,220 --> 04:01:58,540
I was not ready for number... I was not ready for number two.

5494
04:01:59,740 --> 04:02:01,820
I felt so lied to.

5495
04:02:07,940 --> 04:02:13,900
I heard... I heard that he only was going to do it twice, so I let my guard down.

5496
04:02:14,360 --> 04:02:16,260
That was my first mistake.

5497
04:02:18,320 --> 04:02:20,280
I let my guard down.

5498
04:02:23,300 --> 04:02:24,580
Oh, what the fuck?

5499
04:02:24,600 --> 04:02:24,980
That hit?

5500
04:02:25,200 --> 04:02:25,640
What?

5501
04:02:26,240 --> 04:02:27,080
Okay, I missed.

5502
04:02:27,180 --> 04:02:27,920
I don't think this is a run.

5503
04:02:27,940 --> 04:02:28,480
I already messed up.

5504
04:02:32,820 --> 04:02:33,260
Okay.

5505
04:02:34,600 --> 04:02:36,220
I already let my guard down, though.

5506
04:02:40,050 --> 04:02:40,490
Oh.

5507
04:02:42,090 --> 04:02:43,630
I... oh my god.

5508
04:02:43,730 --> 04:02:45,830
I'm just going to... I'm going to do this.

5509
04:02:46,090 --> 04:02:48,970
I know I wasted it, but it doesn't matter now.

5510
04:02:52,110 --> 04:02:53,610
It doesn't matter.

5511
04:02:55,010 --> 04:02:57,990
I just need to do one, and then...

5512
04:02:59,910 --> 04:03:00,390
Fire.

5513
04:03:00,590 --> 04:03:01,210
Oh, wait, no.

5514
04:03:04,310 --> 04:03:04,790
Fire.

5515
04:03:04,790 --> 04:03:05,270
Fire.

5516
04:03:05,650 --> 04:03:06,130
Fire.

5517
04:03:06,470 --> 04:03:06,950
Fire.

5518
04:03:10,130 --> 04:03:10,870
Come on.

5519
04:03:11,330 --> 04:03:12,730
Go, tiger, go!

5520
04:03:18,210 --> 04:03:18,970
Oh, no.

5521
04:03:19,990 --> 04:03:20,890
Oh, no.

5522
04:03:23,390 --> 04:03:24,670
Oh, come on.

5523
04:03:28,800 --> 04:03:30,600
Okay, I know he has one more move.

5524
04:03:31,060 --> 04:03:32,380
And then that last move.

5525
04:03:32,900 --> 04:03:34,360
And then the one more move!

5526
04:03:34,440 --> 04:03:35,480
I almost forgot about that one!

5527
04:03:36,360 --> 04:03:37,280
Oh, okay.

5528
04:03:37,560 --> 04:03:38,520
All right.

5529
04:03:39,840 --> 04:03:40,500
All right.

5530
04:03:40,520 --> 04:03:41,180
I'll wait.

5531
04:03:41,340 --> 04:03:41,900
I'll wait.

5532
04:03:43,780 --> 04:03:44,580
I'll wait.

5533
04:03:46,260 --> 04:03:46,800
What?

5534
04:03:48,580 --> 04:03:50,540
I got faked in there.

5535
04:03:50,720 --> 04:03:53,280
I didn't realize that also.

5536
04:03:53,280 --> 04:03:55,640
I was just... I was like, okay, I'll wait then.

5537
04:03:55,920 --> 04:03:56,760
It'll be fine.

5538
04:03:56,900 --> 04:03:58,420
I'll just keep waiting, I guess.

5539
04:03:59,260 --> 04:04:00,420
He hit me!

5540
04:04:00,740 --> 04:04:03,160
How the fuck did you see me?

5541
04:04:05,680 --> 04:04:07,320
How did you see me?

5542
04:04:11,330 --> 04:04:11,810
Okay.

5543
04:04:15,870 --> 04:04:16,790
Oh, no.

5544
04:04:16,870 --> 04:04:17,610
He still hit me.

5545
04:04:19,070 --> 04:04:19,550
Okay.

5546
04:04:29,000 --> 04:04:29,480
Okay.

5547
04:04:30,700 --> 04:04:31,560
Oh, no.

5548
04:04:34,820 --> 04:04:35,260
What?

5549
04:04:44,220 --> 04:04:44,660
Okay.

5550
04:04:48,640 --> 04:04:49,280
All right.

5551
04:04:49,300 --> 04:04:49,640
Okay.

5552
04:04:50,100 --> 04:04:51,020
Here I go.

5553
04:04:52,840 --> 04:04:54,280
He doesn't see me, right?

5554
04:04:54,420 --> 04:04:54,820
Oh, no.

5555
04:04:54,880 --> 04:04:55,240
He does.

5556
04:04:56,700 --> 04:04:57,780
Guys, he saw me.

5557
04:04:58,120 --> 04:04:59,520
He saw me, guys.

5558
04:05:00,400 --> 04:05:01,540
Guys, he saw me.

5559
04:05:07,220 --> 04:05:09,040
I can't heal when he's...

5560
04:05:09,040 --> 04:05:10,800
I can't heal when he does that!

5561
04:05:10,880 --> 04:05:11,580
It's too fast!

5562
04:05:15,120 --> 04:05:17,500
When he does that, it's too fast!

5563
04:05:17,600 --> 04:05:20,920
He does it so fast!

5564
04:05:23,180 --> 04:05:23,700
No.

5565
04:05:24,460 --> 04:05:25,360
Don't use pluck?

5566
04:05:25,640 --> 04:05:25,860
Okay.

5567
04:05:25,940 --> 04:05:27,320
We're gonna try with no pluck then.

5568
04:05:27,900 --> 04:05:28,820
I don't know.

5569
04:05:28,880 --> 04:05:31,020
I feel like I don't really need the...

5570
04:05:34,020 --> 04:05:34,540
Okay.

5571
04:05:34,680 --> 04:05:35,060
Sorry.

5572
04:05:35,140 --> 04:05:35,800
I fucked it up.

5573
04:05:35,880 --> 04:05:37,800
I started it too early again.

5574
04:05:38,100 --> 04:05:41,700
I started it too early.

5575
04:05:42,080 --> 04:05:44,040
I started it too...

5576
04:05:44,040 --> 04:05:45,220
I will not give up.

5577
04:05:46,060 --> 04:05:48,220
I will not give up, guys.

5578
04:05:48,580 --> 04:05:51,060
I will kill him if I'm leveling up.

5579
04:05:51,180 --> 04:05:51,920
I can do this.

5580
04:05:52,900 --> 04:05:54,920
The moment I do this, I'm a gamer.

5581
04:05:56,780 --> 04:05:59,180
Because you convinced him you should...

5582
04:05:59,180 --> 04:06:00,660
I can't give up now!

5583
04:06:01,540 --> 04:06:02,040
Exactly!

5584
04:06:02,100 --> 04:06:03,340
I can't give up now!

5585
04:06:03,560 --> 04:06:06,820
I could have leveled up, like, 30 minutes ago, but it's too late.

5586
04:06:06,880 --> 04:06:07,740
I can't give up now.

5587
04:06:07,940 --> 04:06:08,960
We're, like, committed.

5588
04:06:09,620 --> 04:06:11,160
We're so committed.

5589
04:06:11,640 --> 04:06:12,140
Like...

5590
04:06:14,040 --> 04:06:16,760
If I give up now after doing all that...

5591
04:06:17,710 --> 04:06:20,520
And just leveling up, then what's the point?

5592
04:06:27,010 --> 04:06:27,710
Okay.

5593
04:06:31,580 --> 04:06:31,930
Okay.

5594
04:06:35,170 --> 04:06:35,870
Okay.

5595
04:06:37,050 --> 04:06:37,750
Okay.

5596
04:06:38,130 --> 04:06:38,830
Oh.

5597
04:06:42,090 --> 04:06:42,790
Okay.

5598
04:06:44,390 --> 04:06:45,090
Okay.

5599
04:06:45,550 --> 04:06:46,990
Focus, focus, focus, focus.

5600
04:06:48,210 --> 04:06:48,690
Focus.

5601
04:06:48,750 --> 04:06:49,310
Focus.

5602
04:06:50,930 --> 04:06:51,490
Focus.

5603
04:06:51,490 --> 04:06:51,770
Doki.

5604
04:06:53,550 --> 04:06:54,370
Come on!

5605
04:06:54,410 --> 04:06:54,890
You're not...

5606
04:06:54,890 --> 04:06:55,910
Don't get hit from that!

5607
04:06:56,410 --> 04:06:56,970
Doki!

5608
04:07:05,130 --> 04:07:06,510
DON'T GET HIT FROM THAT!

5609
04:07:08,390 --> 04:07:08,950
Boom!

5610
04:07:09,950 --> 04:07:11,370
That's fucking right, bitch.

5611
04:07:13,670 --> 04:07:14,850
That's fucking right.

5612
04:07:16,850 --> 04:07:17,410
TRANSFORMATION!

5613
04:07:19,470 --> 04:07:20,810
It's fucking right.

5614
04:07:21,410 --> 04:07:21,970
TRANSFORM!

5615
04:07:23,970 --> 04:07:25,010
GET TIGERED!

5616
04:07:25,050 --> 04:07:25,610
GET TIGERED!

5617
04:07:25,670 --> 04:07:26,210
GET TIGERED!

5618
04:07:27,390 --> 04:07:27,950
Okay.

5619
04:07:30,050 --> 04:07:30,610
Alright.

5620
04:07:30,850 --> 04:07:31,410
Nice.

5621
04:07:32,030 --> 04:07:33,730
Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash!

5622
04:07:37,830 --> 04:07:38,390
Alright.

5623
04:07:38,650 --> 04:07:39,470
I'm gonna heal first.

5624
04:07:42,090 --> 04:07:43,670
He does one more move.

5625
04:07:46,150 --> 04:07:47,410
Two moves, actually.

5626
04:07:47,570 --> 04:07:47,950
I lied.

5627
04:07:53,630 --> 04:07:54,550
Three moves.

5628
04:07:54,590 --> 04:07:55,050
No!

5629
04:07:55,190 --> 04:07:56,130
Oh, he missed.

5630
04:07:59,270 --> 04:07:59,850
Again!

5631
04:08:03,790 --> 04:08:05,190
No, I fucked up timing.

5632
04:08:05,910 --> 04:08:06,490
Okay.

5633
04:08:15,900 --> 04:08:17,800
He does that extra move.

5634
04:08:22,860 --> 04:08:23,440
Yeah.

5635
04:08:36,090 --> 04:08:36,670
Yeah.

5636
04:08:41,690 --> 04:08:42,590
Okay, nice.

5637
04:08:59,980 --> 04:09:00,560
No!

5638
04:09:01,280 --> 04:09:01,920
Fuck!

5639
04:09:02,540 --> 04:09:03,760
I messed it up.

5640
04:09:05,120 --> 04:09:06,940
Then he does that extra move.

5641
04:09:08,460 --> 04:09:10,280
Okay, and then...

5642
04:09:10,820 --> 04:09:11,140
No!

5643
04:09:11,300 --> 04:09:11,740
Fuck!

5644
04:09:16,000 --> 04:09:16,640
Okay.

5645
04:09:17,460 --> 04:09:18,240
Come on.

5646
04:09:26,670 --> 04:09:27,310
Drink.

5647
04:09:27,930 --> 04:09:28,570
Hydrate.

5648
04:09:40,340 --> 04:09:41,320
Oh, no!

5649
04:09:41,680 --> 04:09:43,360
I couldn't dodge it!

5650
04:09:48,160 --> 04:09:48,800
No!

5651
04:09:50,140 --> 04:09:50,780
No!

5652
04:09:50,860 --> 04:09:51,720
I'm dead!

5653
04:09:51,780 --> 04:09:52,040
I'm dead!

5654
04:09:57,660 --> 04:09:59,760
I fucked up the last one!

5655
04:10:01,340 --> 04:10:10,780
The thing is, if you miss time the first one, you miss time the second last one, you get hit by the last one.

5656
04:10:11,100 --> 04:10:13,220
You get hit by the last one.

5657
04:10:13,320 --> 04:10:14,440
The mis-timing.

5658
04:10:19,920 --> 04:10:22,040
I almost had it.

5659
04:10:27,360 --> 04:10:27,720
I can do this.

5660
04:10:29,660 --> 04:10:30,160
Alright.

5661
04:10:41,960 --> 04:10:42,460
Okay.

5662
04:10:45,960 --> 04:10:46,460
Okay.

5663
04:10:48,220 --> 04:10:48,720
Okay.

5664
04:10:50,340 --> 04:10:51,340
And then...

5665
04:10:51,880 --> 04:10:53,500
Oh, he doesn't do the second move?

5666
04:10:53,660 --> 04:10:53,840
Okay.

5667
04:10:54,020 --> 04:10:56,580
I got so used to doing that other move.

5668
04:10:57,160 --> 04:10:57,700
I got so used to doing that other move.

5669
04:10:59,140 --> 04:11:00,500
That, like, fucks with me.

5670
04:11:00,620 --> 04:11:01,880
When he doesn't do it.

5671
04:11:03,360 --> 04:11:03,860
No!

5672
04:11:03,860 --> 04:11:06,400
Like, right now, it fucks with me so much.

5673
04:11:10,980 --> 04:11:13,780
Like, he would do that dive, but he's not doing it.

5674
04:11:14,560 --> 04:11:16,880
And I don't know what to do when he doesn't do it.

5675
04:11:22,470 --> 04:11:23,730
Oh, I wasted that.

5676
04:11:26,090 --> 04:11:28,050
I thought he was gonna do it!

5677
04:11:28,430 --> 04:11:31,070
I wasted that one.

5678
04:11:31,070 --> 04:11:31,190
Oh, what?

5679
04:11:35,970 --> 04:11:38,010
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna use this.

5680
04:11:38,430 --> 04:11:45,310
I legit thought out Wait, what?

5681
04:11:48,550 --> 04:11:49,590
Okay, that's five.

5682
04:11:52,950 --> 04:11:54,230
Oh my god!

5683
04:11:58,920 --> 04:11:59,400
Okay.

5684
04:12:01,140 --> 04:12:02,800
I don't think this is a run though.

5685
04:12:03,400 --> 04:12:04,320
I'm gonna fuck it up really badly.

5686
04:12:16,400 --> 04:12:16,880
Slam!

5687
04:12:18,460 --> 04:12:18,940
Okay.

5688
04:12:26,360 --> 04:12:26,840
Nice!

5689
04:12:26,840 --> 04:12:27,020
Oh!

5690
04:12:27,060 --> 04:12:27,660
No, no, no!

5691
04:12:27,720 --> 04:12:27,920
Not nice!

5692
04:12:31,700 --> 04:12:32,360
Oh, fuck.

5693
04:12:32,500 --> 04:12:32,660
Okay.

5694
04:12:32,800 --> 04:12:33,420
That's fine.

5695
04:12:33,560 --> 04:12:34,280
That's not fine!

5696
04:12:34,680 --> 04:12:35,580
That's not fine!

5697
04:12:42,830 --> 04:12:43,310
Okay.

5698
04:12:46,590 --> 04:12:47,070
What?

5699
04:12:48,010 --> 04:12:49,410
How did that not...

5700
04:12:49,410 --> 04:12:51,210
How did that not work?

5701
04:12:51,310 --> 04:12:51,610
Hey!

5702
04:13:03,320 --> 04:13:05,040
How did that not hit?

5703
04:13:09,050 --> 04:13:10,570
He was right there!

5704
04:13:10,870 --> 04:13:12,010
He was right there!

5705
04:13:12,090 --> 04:13:13,430
He was right in front of me!

5706
04:13:15,810 --> 04:13:18,130
Oh, he was right in front of me.

5707
04:13:18,450 --> 04:13:22,890
Guys, but imagine how fucking awesome it would be if I actually beat him.

5708
04:13:23,190 --> 04:13:25,590
Just imagine that sweet victory.

5709
04:13:25,970 --> 04:13:27,030
Sweet victory.

5710
04:13:32,300 --> 04:13:32,740
Sweet victory.

5711
04:13:33,360 --> 04:13:35,780
But guys, the victory would be so sweet.

5712
04:13:35,780 --> 04:13:37,200
Please, just think about the victory.

5713
04:13:37,560 --> 04:13:38,920
Please, just think about the victory.

5714
04:13:51,730 --> 04:13:53,830
Okay, but what if I just use the tiger early?

5715
04:13:53,950 --> 04:13:54,630
Like, I don't care.

5716
04:13:56,870 --> 04:14:01,150
What if I just use it early?

5717
04:14:01,410 --> 04:14:01,430
What if I just use it early?

5718
04:14:04,850 --> 04:14:05,450
It's okay.

5719
04:14:05,510 --> 04:14:06,570
He's just standing there!

5720
04:14:07,090 --> 04:14:07,650
It's okay.

5721
04:14:09,870 --> 04:14:13,120
He's just standing there!

5722
04:14:13,120 --> 04:14:14,820
It's electricity time.

5723
04:14:15,020 --> 04:14:15,540
It's electricity time.

5724
04:14:16,320 --> 04:14:16,840
Okay.

5725
04:14:19,940 --> 04:14:21,160
Okay, he's doing that now.

5726
04:14:21,740 --> 04:14:22,260
Okay, he's doing that now.

5727
04:14:24,040 --> 04:14:24,760
Come on.

5728
04:14:31,890 --> 04:14:32,410
Okay.

5729
04:14:38,310 --> 04:14:39,190
Okay, come on.

5730
04:14:39,190 --> 04:14:39,970
Come on, use your electricity.

5731
04:14:40,570 --> 04:14:41,090
Nice.

5732
04:14:57,050 --> 04:14:58,270
Oh, come on!

5733
04:15:19,830 --> 04:15:21,890
I jump, you jump, we all jump.

5734
04:15:22,570 --> 04:15:25,410
I jump, you jump, we all jump.

5735
04:15:25,410 --> 04:15:26,150
Oh, okay.

5736
04:15:26,310 --> 04:15:27,150
I guess not.

5737
04:15:28,050 --> 04:15:29,290
Okay, I guess not.

5738
04:15:30,510 --> 04:15:31,730
Okay, I guess not.

5739
04:15:32,230 --> 04:15:33,690
Okay, I guess not.

5740
04:15:34,730 --> 04:15:35,910
I guess not.

5741
04:15:37,090 --> 04:15:37,390
I guess not.

5742
04:15:37,430 --> 04:15:38,670
One, one, one, one, one.

5743
04:15:41,390 --> 04:15:42,790
No hukuna matata.

5744
04:15:44,150 --> 04:15:45,070
No worries.

5745
04:15:48,510 --> 04:15:50,450
Not allowed to have no worries.

5746
04:15:51,030 --> 04:15:52,710
All the worries, apparently.

5747
04:15:56,270 --> 04:15:57,510
All the worries!

5748
04:16:07,330 --> 04:16:09,010
Oh, I forgot about the second one.

5749
04:16:09,170 --> 04:16:09,550
Fuck.

5750
04:16:13,580 --> 04:16:15,500
Okay, I wish I didn't use that.

5751
04:16:15,740 --> 04:16:17,520
Wuka, why did you do the pull dance?

5752
04:16:21,100 --> 04:16:22,400
Wuka, why did you do the pull dance?

5753
04:16:22,400 --> 04:16:22,500
Why did I...

5754
04:16:23,020 --> 04:16:26,120
Why did I do the pull dance?

5755
04:16:26,340 --> 04:16:26,820
Why did I do the pull dance?

5756
04:16:26,820 --> 04:16:27,560
The pull dance.

5757
04:16:29,520 --> 04:16:30,000
Yeah.

5758
04:16:30,500 --> 04:16:30,980
Yeah.

5759
04:16:33,040 --> 04:16:35,500
Oh my god, he started pull dancing.

5760
04:16:36,020 --> 04:16:36,240
Oh my god, he started pull dancing.

5761
04:16:36,240 --> 04:16:38,220
He was like, please, free me.

5762
04:16:38,880 --> 04:16:42,220
Wuka was just like, Free me.

5763
04:16:48,620 --> 04:16:49,560
Come on.

5764
04:16:50,920 --> 04:16:51,720
Come on.

5765
04:16:52,740 --> 04:16:53,900
We can do this.

5766
04:16:58,820 --> 04:16:59,380
Okay.

5767
04:17:05,400 --> 04:17:07,220
This is not looking good already.

5768
04:17:08,560 --> 04:17:09,220
Yeah.

5769
04:17:09,340 --> 04:17:11,700
I took unnecessary damage here.

5770
04:17:15,630 --> 04:17:16,290
Tiger.

5771
04:17:17,150 --> 04:17:17,810
Tiger.

5772
04:17:18,470 --> 04:17:19,130
Tiger.

5773
04:17:19,880 --> 04:17:20,210
Tiger.

5774
04:17:21,410 --> 04:17:22,070
Fire.

5775
04:17:24,050 --> 04:17:25,330
Fire, fire, fire.

5776
04:17:26,310 --> 04:17:26,970
Okay.

5777
04:17:28,150 --> 04:17:29,330
I'm coming over.

5778
04:17:29,590 --> 04:17:30,690
I'm coming over.

5779
04:17:30,690 --> 04:17:30,730
I'm coming over.

5780
04:17:36,560 --> 04:17:38,120
Okay, we got this.

5781
04:17:40,480 --> 04:17:41,900
We might not got this.

5782
04:17:44,820 --> 04:17:45,320
Okay.

5783
04:17:45,660 --> 04:17:46,160
T!

5784
04:17:56,760 --> 04:17:57,260
Okay.

5785
04:18:01,620 --> 04:18:02,220
That's right.

5786
04:18:02,600 --> 04:18:03,260
Fuck you!

5787
04:18:05,980 --> 04:18:06,920
That's fucking right!

5788
04:18:07,980 --> 04:18:08,960
That's fucking right!

5789
04:18:09,000 --> 04:18:09,740
You can't do anything!

5790
04:18:14,700 --> 04:18:15,200
Okay.

5791
04:18:16,660 --> 04:18:17,460
That's right.

5792
04:18:17,500 --> 04:18:18,420
No pull dance for you.

5793
04:18:18,500 --> 04:18:19,000
Sir.

5794
04:18:22,420 --> 04:18:23,100
You...

5795
04:18:23,100 --> 04:18:24,000
I'm sorry!

5796
04:18:26,480 --> 04:18:29,840
He just wants his pull dance, you freak!

5797
04:18:31,440 --> 04:18:32,120
And

5798
04:18:39,920 --> 04:18:41,420
sometimes it's fucking...

5799
04:18:44,000 --> 04:18:44,340
Okay.

5800
04:18:49,340 --> 04:18:50,020
Okay.

5801
04:18:56,500 --> 04:18:59,020
The longest fucking combo of my life.

5802
04:19:02,150 --> 04:19:03,790
Wait, that still hits me!

5803
04:19:04,730 --> 04:19:05,410
Bitch!

5804
04:19:08,990 --> 04:19:09,670
Oh.

5805
04:19:10,490 --> 04:19:11,170
Oh.

5806
04:19:12,030 --> 04:19:13,270
Don't feel good.

5807
04:19:14,110 --> 04:19:15,530
Don't feel good!

5808
04:19:16,350 --> 04:19:17,810
Don't feel good!

5809
04:19:18,590 --> 04:19:22,720
Don't feel good!

5810
04:19:22,720 --> 04:19:23,600
I'm gonna save the...

5811
04:19:27,210 --> 04:19:30,450
I'm saving it for when I need to heal the Cloud Step.

5812
04:19:34,900 --> 04:19:35,580
Okay.

5813
04:19:37,560 --> 04:19:38,640
Nice slam.

5814
04:19:48,760 --> 04:19:49,440
Okay.

5815
04:19:51,320 --> 04:19:52,360
Wait, freeze!

5816
04:19:52,660 --> 04:19:52,760
Wait, freeze!

5817
04:19:59,070 --> 04:19:59,870
I...

5818
04:20:00,870 --> 04:20:02,070
I don't know anymore.

5819
04:20:13,710 --> 04:20:14,510
Why

5820
04:20:17,900 --> 04:20:20,020
did I do that?

5821
04:20:20,500 --> 04:20:23,960
Why did I do that?

5822
04:20:23,960 --> 04:20:24,380
Okay.

5823
04:20:28,380 --> 04:20:29,180
Alright.

5824
04:20:29,180 --> 04:20:30,660
Oh, no.

5825
04:20:30,720 --> 04:20:31,880
Here I go again!

5826
04:20:34,940 --> 04:20:35,960
Oh, no.

5827
04:20:36,060 --> 04:20:36,640
I fucked up.

5828
04:20:36,780 --> 04:20:37,960
I fucked it up.

5829
04:20:39,480 --> 04:20:40,940
I fucked it up, guys.

5830
04:20:41,500 --> 04:20:42,360
Ah, no!

5831
04:20:42,760 --> 04:20:43,360
That

5832
04:20:54,130 --> 04:20:56,270
move always messes me up!

5833
04:20:56,750 --> 04:20:59,610
That move messes me up so much!

5834
04:21:01,270 --> 04:21:03,630
I always mess up the timing!

5835
04:21:05,350 --> 04:21:07,350
I don't have Cloud Step!

5836
04:21:07,350 --> 04:21:09,010
I didn't have it!

5837
04:21:09,550 --> 04:21:10,510
Right now!

5838
04:21:12,490 --> 04:21:14,110
It's always that move!

5839
04:21:14,630 --> 04:21:15,110
It's always that move!

5840
04:21:15,110 --> 04:21:15,750
Oh, my God.

5841
04:21:16,050 --> 04:21:17,890
Okay, I'm gonna use Cloud Step for heals only.

5842
04:21:18,670 --> 04:21:19,870
Okay, that's the new strat.

5843
04:21:20,270 --> 04:21:21,910
Cloud Step on heals only.

5844
04:21:25,680 --> 04:21:26,720
Okay, we figured it out.

5845
04:21:31,200 --> 04:21:31,680
Oh.

5846
04:21:35,370 --> 04:21:36,730
I can do the Tiger, though.

5847
04:21:37,290 --> 04:21:40,110
I learned that I can do the Tiger and have it in time.

5848
04:21:40,690 --> 04:21:42,530
I learned that I can do the Tiger and have it in time.

5849
04:21:52,350 --> 04:21:53,310
Okay, nice.

5850
04:21:54,990 --> 04:21:56,310
I'm gonna use that to heal now.

5851
04:21:57,490 --> 04:21:58,450
And then...

5852
04:21:58,450 --> 04:21:59,190
Smack!

5853
04:22:03,080 --> 04:22:03,560
Okay.

5854
04:22:07,790 --> 04:22:08,270
What?

5855
04:22:08,390 --> 04:22:09,210
That hits me?

5856
04:22:10,430 --> 04:22:12,190
This fucking bitch!

5857
04:22:12,910 --> 04:22:13,330
Okay.

5858
04:22:13,370 --> 04:22:14,350
Don't have Cloud Step.

5859
04:22:14,490 --> 04:22:16,010
So I guess I have to hit!

5860
04:22:16,130 --> 04:22:16,490
Okay.

5861
04:22:16,510 --> 04:22:17,270
Ah!

5862
04:22:25,950 --> 04:22:28,470
We're not stopping until I defeat him.

5863
04:22:28,550 --> 04:22:29,650
We're not stopping.

5864
04:22:30,730 --> 04:22:32,230
We're not stopping.

5865
04:22:33,910 --> 04:22:35,510
Yeah, he can bleed!

5866
04:22:35,870 --> 04:22:37,170
He can bleed!

5867
04:22:37,390 --> 04:22:39,470
I don't need to over level!

5868
04:22:39,910 --> 04:22:41,490
I don't need it!

5869
04:22:43,450 --> 04:22:44,050
No!

5870
04:22:47,590 --> 04:22:51,410
Leveling up has been off the table since the dawn of time!

5871
04:22:52,990 --> 04:22:53,930
I'm a gamer!

5872
04:22:57,330 --> 04:22:57,850
What?

5873
04:22:59,030 --> 04:22:59,370
Okay.

5874
04:23:01,550 --> 04:23:02,070
Okay.

5875
04:23:04,410 --> 04:23:04,930
Okay.

5876
04:23:06,150 --> 04:23:06,670
Oh.

5877
04:23:07,030 --> 04:23:07,550
Concentrate.

5878
04:23:07,550 --> 04:23:08,150
Concentrate, Doki.

5879
04:23:08,230 --> 04:23:08,530
Come on.

5880
04:23:08,530 --> 04:23:08,870
You got this.

5881
04:23:09,790 --> 04:23:11,050
You got this, Doki.

5882
04:23:11,270 --> 04:23:12,750
Come on, Tiger.

5883
04:23:13,430 --> 04:23:14,730
You got this, Doki.

5884
04:23:15,530 --> 04:23:19,930
Don't let this stupid dragon tell you what to do!

5885
04:23:21,850 --> 04:23:24,330
This is why they're extinct now!

5886
04:23:27,030 --> 04:23:30,090
All their ancestors are fucking dead!

5887
04:23:30,770 --> 04:23:31,430
Kill time!

5888
04:23:31,850 --> 04:23:32,490
Yay!

5889
04:23:36,750 --> 04:23:37,070
Oh.

5890
04:23:43,560 --> 04:23:44,200
Okay.

5891
04:23:47,980 --> 04:23:48,620
Okay.

5892
04:23:48,740 --> 04:23:49,440
What's he gonna do?

5893
04:23:49,540 --> 04:23:50,200
Yes, he is.

5894
04:23:50,220 --> 04:23:50,400
Okay.

5895
04:23:50,460 --> 04:23:50,880
He is.

5896
04:23:51,180 --> 04:23:52,960
Can I get that last move too?

5897
04:23:54,120 --> 04:23:54,760
No.

5898
04:23:54,920 --> 04:23:56,180
Majority of his combos.

5899
04:23:58,000 --> 04:23:58,980
Oh, please.

5900
04:24:05,110 --> 04:24:05,590
Okay.

5901
04:24:06,270 --> 04:24:07,210
Oh, okay.

5902
04:24:07,290 --> 04:24:07,810
That's fine.

5903
04:24:08,270 --> 04:24:09,030
That's fine.

5904
04:24:10,970 --> 04:24:11,790
That's fine.

5905
04:24:12,850 --> 04:24:13,530
That's fine.

5906
04:24:13,730 --> 04:24:13,870
That's fine.

5907
04:24:14,590 --> 04:24:16,030
He doesn't know where I live.

5908
04:24:16,150 --> 04:24:16,630
That's fine.

5909
04:24:19,130 --> 04:24:20,090
That's so fine.

5910
04:24:26,830 --> 04:24:27,550
That's okay.

5911
04:24:31,510 --> 04:24:31,990
Okay.

5912
04:24:31,990 --> 04:24:32,090
Okay.

5913
04:24:32,970 --> 04:24:36,190
The pole dancing is the death of me.

5914
04:24:36,370 --> 04:24:38,370
I swear to God.

5915
04:24:39,650 --> 04:24:42,190
The fucking pole dancing.

5916
04:24:43,810 --> 04:24:49,850
There's actually one fear when the monkey starts pole dancing.

5917
04:24:52,430 --> 04:24:54,350
Literally one fear.

5918
04:25:01,430 --> 04:25:02,330
Okay.

5919
04:25:02,330 --> 04:25:02,490
Okay.

5920
04:25:05,360 --> 04:25:06,200
Alright.

5921
04:25:06,320 --> 04:25:06,960
Knocked in there.

5922
04:25:13,100 --> 04:25:15,480
There's literally one fear.

5923
04:25:18,500 --> 04:25:21,060
My only fear in this game.

5924
04:25:25,480 --> 04:25:26,740
Oh, no!

5925
04:25:30,190 --> 04:25:31,030
Alright.

5926
04:25:37,070 --> 04:25:37,910
Alright.

5927
04:25:40,050 --> 04:25:40,890
Alright.

5928
04:25:40,890 --> 04:25:40,990
Oh, no.

5929
04:25:42,910 --> 04:25:44,050
Tee-tee-tee-tee-tee-tee.

5930
04:25:44,970 --> 04:25:45,490
TEEEEEEEEEEE!

5931
04:25:49,500 --> 04:25:50,880
Oh my God.

5932
04:25:51,040 --> 04:25:51,320
Wait.

5933
04:25:51,380 --> 04:25:51,580
What?

5934
04:25:51,900 --> 04:25:52,420
What?

5935
04:25:53,000 --> 04:25:54,920
Oh, it's because he charged it up already?

5936
04:25:56,360 --> 04:25:58,680
It's because he charged it up already!

5937
04:26:04,120 --> 04:26:05,880
Are you serious?

5938
04:26:11,620 --> 04:26:13,600
I didn't know if...

5939
04:26:20,040 --> 04:26:20,620
Oh, my God!

5940
04:26:20,620 --> 04:26:21,300
No way!

5941
04:26:23,280 --> 04:26:25,680
I thought I could do it at any time!

5942
04:26:27,400 --> 04:26:28,240
Oh, my God!

5943
04:26:28,280 --> 04:26:29,420
That was so close!

5944
04:26:29,960 --> 04:26:31,580
That threw me off!

5945
04:26:32,380 --> 04:26:33,860
That threw me off!

5946
04:26:33,940 --> 04:26:35,600
That actually threw me off.

5947
04:26:35,940 --> 04:26:37,400
How do I remove pole dancing?

5948
04:26:37,400 --> 04:26:41,300
We need to remove at- pole dancing was a mistake.

5949
04:26:41,820 --> 04:26:43,580
At-pole-dancing.

5950
04:26:43,600 --> 04:26:45,940
Dancing was a fucking mistake.

5951
04:26:46,460 --> 04:26:47,880
Where is it?

5952
04:26:47,980 --> 04:26:49,040
Is it in this?

5953
04:26:50,370 --> 04:26:51,540
Oh my god, it is.

5954
04:26:51,760 --> 04:26:53,760
Okay, we gotta remove pole dancing.

5955
04:26:55,680 --> 04:26:57,580
Oh my god.

5956
04:26:58,080 --> 04:26:58,740
Okay.

5957
04:27:06,820 --> 04:27:08,700
Re-enact the sparks.

5958
04:27:09,600 --> 04:27:11,180
Alright, where is it?

5959
04:27:11,240 --> 04:27:11,960
Pillars dance.

5960
04:27:14,300 --> 04:27:15,080
Alright, nice.

5961
04:27:15,400 --> 04:27:17,040
Okay, now where do we put it though?

5962
04:27:18,820 --> 04:27:20,400
Wait, where should we put pole dancing?

5963
04:27:23,120 --> 04:27:24,720
Guys, where do we put pole dancing?

5964
04:27:25,880 --> 04:27:27,820
Which should be our focal point.

5965
04:27:31,080 --> 04:27:32,400
Maybe I should do it with magic.

5966
04:27:32,540 --> 04:27:33,300
I'm gonna put it on magic.

5967
04:27:35,740 --> 04:27:36,100
Mana.

5968
04:27:36,100 --> 04:27:37,100
We need more mana.

5969
04:27:37,220 --> 04:27:38,020
No, we need more mana.

5970
04:27:40,900 --> 04:27:41,260
Okay.

5971
04:27:41,260 --> 04:27:41,900
This is it.

5972
04:27:45,950 --> 04:27:46,650
Okay.

5973
04:27:50,610 --> 04:27:52,970
Every... every fight we get stronger.

5974
04:27:54,500 --> 04:27:55,470
Every fight...

5975
04:27:57,620 --> 04:27:58,830
Every fight is knowledge.

5976
04:28:02,350 --> 04:28:03,630
Okay, it's knowledge.

5977
04:28:03,870 --> 04:28:04,990
It's knowledge gain.

5978
04:28:12,200 --> 04:28:13,520
It's knowledge gain.

5979
04:28:13,800 --> 04:28:15,000
Just remember that.

5980
04:28:19,050 --> 04:28:19,650
Tiger time.

5981
04:28:20,830 --> 04:28:22,470
Hey, I heard you talking shit.

5982
04:28:22,670 --> 04:28:24,310
I heard you talking shit.

5983
04:28:24,590 --> 04:28:26,770
I heard you talking shit!

5984
04:28:27,990 --> 04:28:29,090
Tiger time!

5985
04:28:29,810 --> 04:28:30,890
Oh shit, sorry.

5986
04:28:31,010 --> 04:28:31,930
You... wrong way.

5987
04:28:32,790 --> 04:28:34,210
I need you to get closer.

5988
04:28:39,520 --> 04:28:40,340
Heal time.

5989
04:28:41,160 --> 04:28:41,960
Oh, okay.

5990
04:28:42,100 --> 04:28:43,520
Alright, that's... that's a little awkward.

5991
04:28:43,520 --> 04:28:43,660
Wait.

5992
04:28:45,620 --> 04:28:46,380
Alright.

5993
04:28:51,260 --> 04:28:52,200
Oh no.

5994
04:28:52,320 --> 04:28:52,660
Come on.

5995
04:28:53,480 --> 04:28:54,720
Are you serious?

5996
04:28:57,220 --> 04:28:57,980
Okay.

5997
04:29:09,360 --> 04:29:09,740
Okay.

5998
04:29:14,960 --> 04:29:16,000
Oh no.

5999
04:29:16,220 --> 04:29:16,760
Heal.

6000
04:29:17,540 --> 04:29:18,300
Yes!

6001
04:29:21,900 --> 04:29:22,560
Got it.

6002
04:29:27,230 --> 04:29:28,130
Come on.

6003
04:29:31,670 --> 04:29:32,430
Nice.

6004
04:29:35,510 --> 04:29:36,270
No, no, no.

6005
04:29:37,470 --> 04:29:38,390
No, fuck.

6006
04:29:38,570 --> 04:29:38,830
Okay.

6007
04:29:39,130 --> 04:29:39,810
It's fine.

6008
04:29:39,930 --> 04:29:40,390
That's fine.

6009
04:29:45,560 --> 04:29:46,080
Alright.

6010
04:29:50,230 --> 04:29:51,350
Further I am.

6011
04:29:51,550 --> 04:29:52,670
Let's save for out B.

6012
04:29:55,070 --> 04:29:55,590
Woo!

6013
04:29:56,130 --> 04:29:56,810
Heal time.

6014
04:29:57,870 --> 04:29:58,510
Heal time.

6015
04:30:02,170 --> 04:30:02,690
Freeze.

6016
04:30:09,730 --> 04:30:10,250
Okay.

6017
04:30:10,250 --> 04:30:10,970
Heal time.

6018
04:30:13,370 --> 04:30:13,810
Okay.

6019
04:30:14,410 --> 04:30:15,930
Oh, he's looking at me.

6020
04:30:18,070 --> 04:30:20,350
I don't like how he's looking at me, guys.

6021
04:30:26,000 --> 04:30:26,440
Yeah.

6022
04:30:38,760 --> 04:30:39,860
Are you serious?

6023
04:30:40,020 --> 04:30:41,040
Are you fucking kidding me?

6024
04:30:41,400 --> 04:30:41,660
Okay.

6025
04:30:47,150 --> 04:30:47,750
Fuck this.

6026
04:30:47,970 --> 04:30:48,190
No!

6027
04:30:50,370 --> 04:30:50,810
I...

6028
04:30:50,810 --> 04:30:53,850
I pressed three!

6029
04:30:55,170 --> 04:30:55,610
I...

6030
04:30:55,610 --> 04:30:55,930
I pressed three!

6031
04:30:55,930 --> 04:30:56,110
I...

6032
04:30:56,110 --> 04:30:56,190
I pressed three!

6033
04:30:56,190 --> 04:30:56,590
Oh!

6034
04:30:57,290 --> 04:31:01,350
Little between two and three!

6035
04:31:01,850 --> 04:31:03,230
Oh my gosh!

6036
04:31:03,270 --> 04:31:04,150
He tried to climb.

6037
04:31:04,810 --> 04:31:06,450
My hand went through!

6038
04:31:09,300 --> 04:31:10,180
No!

6039
04:31:10,960 --> 04:31:12,720
Not the boys.

6040
04:31:13,380 --> 04:31:14,920
The boys.

6041
04:31:17,540 --> 04:31:20,620
The boys spiked me up.

6042
04:31:20,900 --> 04:31:22,420
The boys.

6043
04:31:22,420 --> 04:31:25,060
You're not supposed to get over.

6044
04:31:25,760 --> 04:31:27,460
Oh my god.

6045
04:31:27,640 --> 04:31:28,620
The boys.

6046
04:31:28,980 --> 04:31:29,680
Bunch me up.

6047
04:31:29,680 --> 04:31:33,080
Boys, why you do this to me, boys?

6048
04:31:35,520 --> 04:31:38,140
We could have had it all, boys!

6049
04:31:41,200 --> 04:31:42,840
This was... that was it!

6050
04:31:45,280 --> 04:31:47,140
That was actually it!

6051
04:31:47,440 --> 04:31:49,200
That was actually it!

6052
04:31:49,340 --> 04:31:50,660
That's the worst part!

6053
04:31:51,360 --> 04:31:52,620
When it was it!

6054
04:31:55,740 --> 04:31:57,020
When it was it!

6055
04:31:58,340 --> 04:32:00,540
Oh my god, when it was it!

6056
04:32:01,720 --> 04:32:03,120
When it was it!

6057
04:32:09,760 --> 04:32:10,320
Okay.

6058
04:32:16,200 --> 04:32:16,760
Oh,

6059
04:32:20,620 --> 04:32:20,960
I...

6060
04:32:22,000 --> 04:32:23,300
I mistimed that.

6061
04:32:29,310 --> 04:32:30,270
Okay, there we go.

6062
04:32:34,310 --> 04:32:35,030
That's fine.

6063
04:32:36,290 --> 04:32:36,970
That's fine.

6064
04:32:38,310 --> 04:32:40,390
That's absolutely fine.

6065
04:32:50,770 --> 04:32:51,530
It's fine.

6066
04:32:53,130 --> 04:32:53,670
Sick.

6067
04:33:06,680 --> 04:33:08,500
Alright, here we go again, I guess.

6068
04:33:16,640 --> 04:33:18,420
Oh my god, fuck.

6069
04:33:21,220 --> 04:33:22,580
I have to heal on here.

6070
04:33:23,620 --> 04:33:24,120
I have to heal on here.

6071
04:33:24,360 --> 04:33:25,340
Come on, come on.

6072
04:33:25,360 --> 04:33:25,580
No!

6073
04:33:26,760 --> 04:33:27,260
I

6074
04:33:31,990 --> 04:33:33,510
got stuck against this wall.

6075
04:33:33,910 --> 04:33:35,710
The wall got me.

6076
04:33:36,470 --> 04:33:37,690
Never give up, Doki.

6077
04:33:37,790 --> 04:33:38,490
Never give up.

6078
04:33:38,570 --> 04:33:39,530
You are a gamer.

6079
04:33:39,710 --> 04:33:41,010
You don't need to level up.

6080
04:33:41,450 --> 04:33:43,550
You don't need to level up.

6081
04:33:44,110 --> 04:33:46,570
If you level up, the game won't be as fun.

6082
04:33:46,930 --> 04:33:49,330
Because you'll just be killing everything instantly.

6083
04:33:49,990 --> 04:33:51,890
You don't need to level up.

6084
04:33:53,770 --> 04:33:55,130
You don't need to level up.

6085
04:33:55,130 --> 04:33:56,550
Everything won't get too easy.

6086
04:34:01,070 --> 04:34:02,770
And what's the fun in that?

6087
04:34:07,130 --> 04:34:07,730
Okay.

6088
04:34:13,460 --> 04:34:14,060
Okay.

6089
04:34:19,450 --> 04:34:20,050
Tiger.

6090
04:34:20,930 --> 04:34:21,530
Tiger.

6091
04:34:22,370 --> 04:34:22,970
Tiger.

6092
04:34:23,610 --> 04:34:24,210
Tiger.

6093
04:34:26,170 --> 04:34:27,270
It's fucking red.

6094
04:34:27,310 --> 04:34:27,790
I see you.

6095
04:34:28,110 --> 04:34:29,130
I see you.

6096
04:34:31,790 --> 04:34:33,930
You're gonna let me tiger you!

6097
04:34:36,190 --> 04:34:36,630
Okay.

6098
04:34:41,690 --> 04:34:43,350
Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.

6099
04:34:44,650 --> 04:34:46,210
You know all the patterns now.

6100
04:34:46,470 --> 04:34:48,650
You should know all of the patterns by heart!

6101
04:34:54,610 --> 04:34:55,510
Guys, I looked away.

6102
04:34:56,650 --> 04:34:57,610
Guys, I looked away.

6103
04:34:58,390 --> 04:34:59,190
Guys, I...

6104
04:35:10,330 --> 04:35:11,590
Guys, I blinked and...

6105
04:35:11,590 --> 04:35:12,230
What happened?

6106
04:35:13,470 --> 04:35:13,910
Guys,

6107
04:35:18,610 --> 04:35:19,270
I blinked.

6108
04:35:19,270 --> 04:35:19,770
What happened?

6109
04:35:19,770 --> 04:35:20,030
What happened?

6110
04:35:20,050 --> 04:35:21,930
What happened?

6111
04:35:28,300 --> 04:35:29,360
Okay, full focus.

6112
04:35:29,480 --> 04:35:29,800
No talk.

6113
04:35:29,940 --> 04:35:30,260
No talk.

6114
04:35:30,440 --> 04:35:31,820
Doki, no talk anymore.

6115
04:36:01,450 --> 04:36:02,890
Come on.

6116
04:36:17,350 --> 04:36:18,070
Nice.

6117
04:36:24,920 --> 04:36:25,640
Here.

6118
04:36:44,000 --> 04:36:44,720
Smack!

6119
04:36:45,140 --> 04:36:45,680
What?

6120
04:37:38,400 --> 04:37:39,120
What?

6121
04:37:40,140 --> 04:37:40,860
What?

6122
04:37:44,420 --> 04:37:45,140
What?

6123
04:37:45,260 --> 04:37:45,620
What?

6124
04:38:15,620 --> 04:38:19,680
That was a full on hack.

6125
04:38:19,920 --> 04:38:30,980
I refuse to believe that like, literally on my screen, it shows that like, I was still invisible.

6126
04:38:31,960 --> 04:38:34,960
Like, I thought I was still invisible.

6127
04:38:41,460 --> 04:38:43,960
How do I know when I'm not invisible?

6128
04:38:44,880 --> 04:38:46,240
Jack is pissy!

6129
04:39:08,290 --> 04:39:09,650
I fucked it up.

6130
04:39:09,710 --> 04:39:10,470
I fucked it up.

6131
04:39:13,640 --> 04:39:15,160
I have to use that.

6132
04:39:20,000 --> 04:39:20,520
Okay.

6133
04:39:30,510 --> 04:39:31,030
Okay.

6134
04:40:01,520 --> 04:40:02,560
Come on!

6135
04:40:18,840 --> 04:40:19,240
No!

6136
04:40:20,660 --> 04:40:21,060
Okay.

6137
04:40:35,100 --> 04:40:35,720
It's fine.

6138
04:40:36,440 --> 04:40:37,440
I have the heal.

6139
04:40:58,990 --> 04:40:59,390
What?!

6140
04:41:25,730 --> 04:41:26,130
No!

6141
04:41:26,230 --> 04:41:26,590
Oh no!

6142
04:41:26,650 --> 04:41:27,170
I fucked it up!

6143
04:41:32,360 --> 04:41:35,400
And you're like, make sure when he looks at me, then I know.

6144
04:41:38,640 --> 04:41:39,420
Okay, nice.

6145
04:41:40,480 --> 04:41:40,880
Nice.

6146
04:41:50,460 --> 04:41:51,300
Oh!!!!!

6147
04:41:51,300 --> 04:41:52,800
The fired Careful!

6148
04:41:56,290 --> 04:41:57,890
That slamm!

6149
04:41:58,430 --> 04:42:00,710
That slime takes so much!

6150
04:42:02,450 --> 04:42:03,990
That slide!

6151
04:42:05,970 --> 04:42:08,350
What was that damage?!

6152
04:42:09,890 --> 04:42:10,730
Jack!

6153
04:42:10,770 --> 04:42:11,510
Thank you for....

6154
04:42:11,510 --> 04:42:13,630
I'm fucking feel powered up!

6155
04:42:13,630 --> 04:42:16,170
Thank you for the magenta super attack!

6156
04:42:16,390 --> 04:42:17,790
Thank you, thank you!

6157
04:42:19,650 --> 04:42:20,510
It's the slab.

6158
04:42:21,470 --> 04:42:21,950
Okay.

6159
04:42:33,370 --> 04:42:33,850
Okay.

6160
04:42:39,340 --> 04:42:39,820
Okay.

6161
04:42:51,890 --> 04:42:53,750
Oh, I should have hit him.

6162
04:42:53,870 --> 04:42:54,810
That was a free hit.

6163
04:42:55,390 --> 04:42:57,410
That was a free fucking hit right there.

6164
04:42:59,850 --> 04:43:01,690
Fire, fire, fire, fire.

6165
04:43:06,590 --> 04:43:07,490
Oh my god.

6166
04:43:08,530 --> 04:43:09,890
I'm a bit mad at it.

6167
04:43:17,370 --> 04:43:17,730
Okay.

6168
04:43:19,110 --> 04:43:19,470
Okay.

6169
04:43:22,850 --> 04:43:23,210
What?

6170
04:43:25,630 --> 04:43:27,050
Okay, t-t-t-t-t, come on.

6171
04:43:27,870 --> 04:43:28,930
Oh, did I hit that head?

6172
04:43:28,950 --> 04:43:29,710
Yes, yes, yes, I hit.

6173
04:43:29,970 --> 04:43:31,130
Okay, that's good.

6174
04:43:31,670 --> 04:43:32,490
That's good that I hit.

6175
04:43:38,040 --> 04:43:38,620
Okay, nice.

6176
04:43:41,640 --> 04:43:42,420
That's fine.

6177
04:43:42,500 --> 04:43:44,000
I have full- I have heals.

6178
04:43:45,320 --> 04:43:45,900
Come on.

6179
04:43:55,820 --> 04:43:56,320
Okay.

6180
04:43:59,440 --> 04:44:01,140
Oh no, this is bad, this is bad.

6181
04:44:01,680 --> 04:44:03,080
He's doing flips with me!

6182
04:44:15,480 --> 04:44:15,980
Ah!

6183
04:44:20,850 --> 04:44:22,710
I need to get that timing!

6184
04:44:23,130 --> 04:44:25,890
That- that last timing always fucks me up.

6185
04:44:25,890 --> 04:44:26,470
The last two.

6186
04:44:27,830 --> 04:44:30,770
How are you still here two hours late?

6187
04:44:30,770 --> 04:44:33,450
This is my orphan of cause.

6188
04:44:33,710 --> 04:44:36,210
This is my fucking orphan of cause right now.

6189
04:44:36,350 --> 04:44:44,710
This is like the fucking skill jump between this guy and every other boss is actually crazy.

6190
04:44:45,030 --> 04:44:53,890
Like I don't understand the skill jump there.

6191
04:44:59,330 --> 04:45:01,690
It's- yeah, the time- it's like different timing.

6192
04:45:02,070 --> 04:45:03,870
So that's like the hardest part.

6193
04:45:04,070 --> 04:45:07,450
The fact that the timing is like- it's like different.

6194
04:45:09,990 --> 04:45:11,770
Oh my god, I almost thought I was gonna-

6195
04:45:16,010 --> 04:45:17,510
Okay, you say it's not that hard.

6196
04:45:17,630 --> 04:45:19,130
I wanna know what your level is.

6197
04:45:19,430 --> 04:45:19,830
Hahaha!

6198
04:45:22,050 --> 04:45:22,450
Hahaha!

6199
04:45:23,930 --> 04:45:24,330
Hahaha!

6200
04:45:29,150 --> 04:45:29,730
Okay.

6201
04:45:33,780 --> 04:45:35,620
Just look at the damage I do.

6202
04:45:39,440 --> 04:45:42,140
He has so much armor on him.

6203
04:45:44,440 --> 04:45:45,020
What?

6204
04:45:45,280 --> 04:45:46,440
Oh, I thought I used Cloud.

6205
04:45:46,740 --> 04:45:47,620
I didn't.

6206
04:45:51,720 --> 04:45:52,740
What's your level?

6207
04:45:52,780 --> 04:45:53,960
I need to know.

6208
04:45:54,380 --> 04:45:56,600
Why isn't it difficult for you?

6209
04:46:00,400 --> 04:46:01,140
Oh no.

6210
04:46:01,240 --> 04:46:01,640
No!

6211
04:46:01,820 --> 04:46:03,340
I couldn't get the fucking hair!

6212
04:46:03,760 --> 04:46:04,660
Oh, not the hair.

6213
04:46:04,780 --> 04:46:06,320
I mean the- Okay, it's over.

6214
04:46:08,260 --> 04:46:08,920
It's over.

6215
04:46:10,300 --> 04:46:11,020
It's over.

6216
04:46:11,220 --> 04:46:13,160
I couldn't press T in time.

6217
04:46:13,520 --> 04:46:15,800
I couldn't press T on time.

6218
04:46:17,320 --> 04:46:18,280
Thank you!

6219
04:46:20,940 --> 04:46:26,000
Can I rebind it to- okay, I'm gonna try to see if I can rebind T to my mouse button.

6220
04:46:31,300 --> 04:46:34,280
Okay, I'm gonna rebind it to my mouse button.

6221
04:46:35,820 --> 04:46:37,400
Okay, let's see.

6222
04:46:37,920 --> 04:46:39,160
I'm gonna see if I can.

6223
04:46:39,400 --> 04:46:40,820
I don't think I can though.

6224
04:46:40,960 --> 04:46:43,220
I think I tried to and it wouldn't let me.

6225
04:46:43,580 --> 04:46:44,280
Where's T?

6226
04:46:44,980 --> 04:46:46,320
Where the fuck is T?

6227
04:46:49,060 --> 04:46:52,680
I can use mouse button?!

6228
04:46:53,300 --> 04:46:56,040
I can use middle mouse button!

6229
04:46:56,360 --> 04:46:56,920
Okay.

6230
04:46:58,100 --> 04:46:58,660
Okay.

6231
04:46:59,280 --> 04:47:00,520
Bro.

6232
04:47:02,120 --> 04:47:03,380
Why can't-

6233
04:47:08,160 --> 04:47:09,000
Okay.

6234
04:47:09,000 --> 04:47:09,840
Okay.

6235
04:47:10,200 --> 04:47:14,160
You can't use mouse button.

6236
04:47:17,300 --> 04:47:18,580
That's fucked.

6237
04:47:18,700 --> 04:47:20,040
That's actually fucked.

6238
04:47:23,200 --> 04:47:25,420
Oh, I don't know why I did that, but okay.

6239
04:47:30,120 --> 04:47:30,560
Okay.

6240
04:47:33,620 --> 04:47:34,060
Okay.

6241
04:47:34,800 --> 04:47:35,000
Alright.

6242
04:47:39,650 --> 04:47:41,390
Focus, focus, focus, focus, turkey.

6243
04:47:43,050 --> 04:47:43,690
That's fine.

6244
04:47:43,750 --> 04:47:44,370
You can heal now.

6245
04:47:45,190 --> 04:47:46,290
Okay, I'm gonna smack him.

6246
04:47:49,970 --> 04:47:50,670
Okay, nice.

6247
04:47:50,770 --> 04:47:51,510
You can smack him.

6248
04:47:52,570 --> 04:47:53,950
And you can use your tagger.

6249
04:47:54,470 --> 04:47:58,530
And you can use your tagger.

6250
04:47:58,530 --> 04:48:04,540
And you can use your tagger.

6251
04:48:04,540 --> 04:48:04,800
And you can use your tagger.

6252
04:48:04,800 --> 04:48:05,260
And you can use your tagger.

6253
04:48:06,600 --> 04:48:08,920
One, one, one, one!

6254
04:48:13,440 --> 04:48:14,460
Wait, am I not?

6255
04:48:15,780 --> 04:48:16,300
Okay.

6256
04:48:18,220 --> 04:48:18,740
Nice.

6257
04:48:19,880 --> 04:48:20,400
Nice.

6258
04:48:22,260 --> 04:48:23,720
Okay, good timing on that.

6259
04:48:31,280 --> 04:48:32,260
That's not good.

6260
04:48:33,780 --> 04:48:34,660
Okay, that's good.

6261
04:48:40,710 --> 04:48:42,310
Nice, I got the cloud in time.

6262
04:48:45,810 --> 04:48:47,350
Alright, this is where I die, I guess.

6263
04:48:50,290 --> 04:48:51,750
Okay, when he looks at me, I'll know.

6264
04:48:52,330 --> 04:48:53,250
Like, right now.

6265
04:48:58,070 --> 04:48:58,370
Okay.

6266
04:48:59,070 --> 04:48:59,810
Oh, I got it.

6267
04:49:03,150 --> 04:49:03,450
Okay.

6268
04:49:04,510 --> 04:49:05,090
I got it.

6269
04:49:05,670 --> 04:49:06,410
Alright, I did it.

6270
04:49:27,480 --> 04:49:28,120
Okay, nice.

6271
04:49:30,380 --> 04:49:31,300
That's not nice.

6272
04:49:41,480 --> 04:49:42,000
Okay.

6273
04:49:49,130 --> 04:49:49,650
What?

6274
04:49:51,410 --> 04:49:52,390
That was bullshit.

6275
04:49:52,490 --> 04:49:52,930
That was bullshit.

6276
04:49:54,210 --> 04:49:55,490
That was actually bullshit!

6277
04:50:06,690 --> 04:50:07,210
Calm.

6278
04:50:13,800 --> 04:50:14,320
Calm!

6279
04:50:16,960 --> 04:50:17,480
Calm!

6280
04:50:19,500 --> 04:50:20,480
So calm.

6281
04:50:23,260 --> 04:50:24,400
So calm.

6282
04:50:25,500 --> 04:50:26,900
Oh my god.

6283
04:50:27,060 --> 04:50:27,660
God damn it.

6284
04:50:33,000 --> 04:50:33,620
Ttt.

6285
04:50:33,880 --> 04:50:34,900
Are you...

6286
04:50:37,180 --> 04:50:38,820
That was bullshit.

6287
04:50:46,180 --> 04:50:47,820
I almost got it.

6288
04:50:47,940 --> 04:50:50,100
Aw, I almost got the timing.

6289
04:50:50,840 --> 04:50:53,000
I almost got the timing.

6290
04:50:53,220 --> 04:50:54,180
You can do it, Dookie.

6291
04:50:54,440 --> 04:50:56,600
Do your best to never give up!

6292
04:50:56,640 --> 04:50:58,580
Only if you basically never give up once!

6293
04:51:00,540 --> 04:51:02,340
It was so close.

6294
04:51:02,560 --> 04:51:04,960
I almost got that timing correctly too.

6295
04:51:05,300 --> 04:51:10,740
I almost... I just needed like... I was like 0.1 second too slow.

6296
04:51:10,900 --> 04:51:14,040
I was actually 0.1 second too slow.

6297
04:51:28,310 --> 04:51:30,990
Oh, that was a dodge I shouldn't have done.

6298
04:51:31,410 --> 04:51:33,910
I didn't need to do that dodge.

6299
04:51:38,800 --> 04:51:41,000
I just want to get the Tiger out early.

6300
04:51:42,160 --> 04:51:42,680
Tiger.

6301
04:51:43,500 --> 04:51:44,020
Tiger.

6302
04:51:45,260 --> 04:51:46,500
Come on, we're so close.

6303
04:51:47,040 --> 04:51:47,560
Nice.

6304
04:51:47,940 --> 04:51:48,740
Fire, fire.

6305
04:51:50,140 --> 04:51:51,080
Come on, Tiger.

6306
04:51:51,080 --> 04:51:51,780
You got this.

6307
04:51:52,120 --> 04:51:53,980
Do it for the homies, Tiger.

6308
04:51:54,520 --> 04:51:56,020
Do it for the homies.

6309
04:52:03,570 --> 04:52:04,090
Nice.

6310
04:52:10,870 --> 04:52:11,390
Nice.

6311
04:52:12,090 --> 04:52:12,370
Okay.

6312
04:52:14,450 --> 04:52:15,290
Okay, bitch.

6313
04:52:17,710 --> 04:52:19,030
Okay, bitch.

6314
04:52:21,490 --> 04:52:23,210
That's actually bullshit.

6315
04:52:30,210 --> 04:52:31,530
That was bullshit.

6316
04:52:31,610 --> 04:52:32,390
They're not gonna lie.

6317
04:52:32,590 --> 04:52:33,530
I'll say it.

6318
04:52:34,150 --> 04:52:36,010
That was fucking bullshit.

6319
04:52:37,030 --> 04:52:38,010
Oh, okay.

6320
04:52:38,070 --> 04:52:38,530
That too.

6321
04:52:44,180 --> 04:52:45,800
That was also bullshit.

6322
04:52:46,400 --> 04:52:47,060
Bam.

6323
04:52:58,460 --> 04:52:59,100
Bam.

6324
04:53:03,680 --> 04:53:05,140
Okay, time to die.

6325
04:53:09,240 --> 04:53:10,300
Time to die.

6326
04:53:10,620 --> 04:53:19,060
Time to die, cause I ran out of... I ran out of fucking... I ran out of fucking... Oh my god.

6327
04:53:23,580 --> 04:53:25,620
I was so low.

6328
04:53:25,620 --> 04:53:25,880
Oh no!

6329
04:53:26,720 --> 04:53:28,080
Holy shit!

6330
04:53:43,730 --> 04:53:45,970
Moro fucks me up when he does it twice!

6331
04:54:08,470 --> 04:54:11,110
Jesus Christ, even the smack isn't even that much.

6332
04:54:11,330 --> 04:54:12,710
That's like the saddest part.

6333
04:54:17,350 --> 04:54:18,250
Oh my god.

6334
04:54:20,230 --> 04:54:21,450
Do it for her!

6335
04:54:27,900 --> 04:54:29,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6336
04:54:29,600 --> 04:54:30,480
Maybe never mind.

6337
04:54:30,760 --> 04:54:32,320
Maybe not right now, though.

6338
04:54:32,460 --> 04:54:34,220
Maybe not right now, though, guys.

6339
04:54:34,300 --> 04:54:35,400
Maybe not right now.

6340
04:54:38,260 --> 04:54:41,120
Guys, I don't have any more gourds, guys.

6341
04:54:42,260 --> 04:54:44,240
Guys, I don't have any more gourds.

6342
04:54:52,480 --> 04:54:53,600
Oh fuck.

6343
04:54:54,400 --> 04:54:55,960
Oh, he's so good!

6344
04:54:55,980 --> 04:54:56,280
I'm going!

6345
04:55:00,700 --> 04:55:01,900
I'm dead.

6346
04:55:09,550 --> 04:55:12,370
The moment I saw the...

6347
04:55:12,670 --> 04:55:15,090
The moment I saw the...

6348
04:55:15,770 --> 04:55:18,170
Oh my god.

6349
04:55:18,730 --> 04:55:23,350
I saw the thing and then I was like, this is how I die.

6350
04:55:24,510 --> 04:55:26,730
This is how I die.

6351
04:55:27,290 --> 04:55:29,170
Yuki, thank you for the Akasufa.

6352
04:55:29,310 --> 04:55:30,250
Thank you, thank you.

6353
04:55:30,490 --> 04:55:31,270
You got this.

6354
04:55:31,330 --> 04:55:32,030
Don't give up.

6355
04:55:32,690 --> 04:55:33,470
I got this.

6356
04:55:33,550 --> 04:55:34,050
I got this.

6357
04:55:34,130 --> 04:55:34,610
I got this.

6358
04:55:36,310 --> 04:55:37,490
Oh my god.

6359
04:55:38,810 --> 04:55:39,210
Every...

6360
04:55:40,130 --> 04:55:41,830
Every run, we get stronger.

6361
04:55:46,520 --> 04:55:46,920
Okay.

6362
04:55:47,800 --> 04:55:48,280
It's okay.

6363
04:55:48,360 --> 04:55:49,340
Every run, we're getting stronger.

6364
04:55:53,100 --> 04:55:53,500
Bye.

6365
04:55:54,260 --> 04:55:54,660
Tiger.

6366
04:55:55,540 --> 04:55:55,940
Tiger.

6367
04:55:56,580 --> 04:55:56,980
Tiger.

6368
04:55:56,980 --> 04:55:57,260
Tiger.

6369
04:55:57,260 --> 04:55:58,240
Tiger.

6370
04:55:58,560 --> 04:55:59,160
Tiger.

6371
04:55:59,980 --> 04:56:01,180
Tiger.

6372
04:56:01,360 --> 04:56:02,560
Tiger.

6373
04:56:03,080 --> 04:56:03,080
Tiger.

6374
04:56:03,200 --> 04:56:04,100
Tiger.

6375
04:56:04,200 --> 04:56:04,300
Tiger.

6376
04:56:04,300 --> 04:56:04,460
Tiger.

6377
04:56:04,460 --> 04:56:05,420
Tiger.

6378
04:56:06,540 --> 04:56:07,140
Tiger.

6379
04:56:07,460 --> 04:56:07,460
Tiger.

6380
04:56:08,340 --> 04:56:09,200
Tiger.

6381
04:56:10,140 --> 04:56:11,940
DO WHAT YOU'RE MEANT TO DO!

6382
04:56:24,080 --> 04:56:25,620
Oh my god, guys.

6383
04:56:25,800 --> 04:56:28,540
Guys, I need to turn down the effects.

6384
04:56:30,060 --> 04:56:33,980
I've been fighting him for so long.

6385
04:56:38,220 --> 04:56:39,980
The effects are breaking.

6386
04:56:41,140 --> 04:56:43,080
I need to lie.

6387
04:56:46,280 --> 04:56:47,600
Oh my god.

6388
04:56:50,220 --> 04:56:53,260
I've actually been fighting him for way too long.

6389
04:56:58,020 --> 04:57:01,220
The PC is not having it right now.

6390
04:57:01,840 --> 04:57:05,680
The PC is actually breaking up.

6391
04:57:06,740 --> 04:57:08,340
The PC is like, please.

6392
04:57:09,680 --> 04:57:11,060
Kill him already.

6393
04:57:12,180 --> 04:57:15,260
I really need you to kill him.

6394
04:57:20,680 --> 04:57:22,160
Kill him already.

6395
04:57:26,250 --> 04:57:26,620
Nice.

6396
04:57:27,310 --> 04:57:28,240
Oh, thank god.

6397
04:57:30,180 --> 04:57:31,380
Oh, thank god.

6398
04:57:37,820 --> 04:57:38,560
Okay.

6399
04:57:44,110 --> 04:57:44,820
Okay, nice.

6400
04:57:47,200 --> 04:57:47,940
Oh.

6401
04:57:48,990 --> 04:57:49,360
Oh.

6402
04:57:53,840 --> 04:57:56,240
I have to restart the game?

6403
04:57:56,880 --> 04:57:57,400
Okay.

6404
04:57:57,500 --> 04:57:59,540
If I die here, I shall restart.

6405
04:58:03,560 --> 04:58:04,080
Okay.

6406
04:58:04,420 --> 04:58:05,500
I guess, goodbye.

6407
04:58:07,940 --> 04:58:08,840
Goodbye, then.

6408
04:58:11,780 --> 04:58:13,920
Okay, we'll know when he sees me.

6409
04:58:14,320 --> 04:58:15,560
Do you think he knows?

6410
04:58:16,080 --> 04:58:17,000
Do you think?

6411
04:58:17,060 --> 04:58:18,120
Oh, he definitely knows now.

6412
04:58:18,200 --> 04:58:18,980
He knows now.

6413
04:58:21,540 --> 04:58:23,240
He definitely knows now.

6414
04:58:23,240 --> 04:58:23,360
He knows now.

6415
04:58:24,720 --> 04:58:25,420
Okay.

6416
04:58:30,980 --> 04:58:34,660
God damn it.

6417
04:58:36,220 --> 04:58:37,620
Okay.

6418
04:58:49,400 --> 04:58:50,800
C'mon.

6419
04:58:57,570 --> 04:58:58,970
Okay.

6420
04:59:07,210 --> 04:59:08,890
It's fine.

6421
04:59:09,110 --> 04:59:10,350
That's fine.

6422
04:59:19,620 --> 04:59:21,260
No, okay.

6423
04:59:22,740 --> 04:59:24,140
Okay.

6424
04:59:32,530 --> 04:59:33,870
Alright.

6425
04:59:34,510 --> 04:59:36,010
I'm fine.

6426
04:59:41,600 --> 04:59:42,660
No.

6427
04:59:48,920 --> 04:59:50,420
Oh no!

6428
04:59:51,000 --> 04:59:51,920
No!

6429
04:59:52,080 --> 04:59:52,940
The frame!

6430
04:59:56,620 --> 04:59:57,760
Oh god.

6431
04:59:59,380 --> 05:00:00,420
Oh god, please.

6432
05:00:05,940 --> 05:00:06,980
It's okay.

6433
05:00:07,500 --> 05:00:08,420
Tiger!

6434
05:00:09,000 --> 05:00:09,460
Tiger!

6435
05:00:09,680 --> 05:00:10,560
Tiger!

6436
05:00:11,060 --> 05:00:11,980
Tiger!

6437
05:00:12,320 --> 05:00:13,240
Tiger!

6438
05:00:13,460 --> 05:00:14,380
Tiger!

6439
05:00:15,200 --> 05:00:16,120
Tiger!

6440
05:00:26,620 --> 05:00:28,020
Yes!

6441
05:00:34,500 --> 05:00:37,560
What have you done?

6442
05:00:38,960 --> 05:00:42,260
Oh my god.

6443
05:00:47,620 --> 05:00:50,080
I did it.

6444
05:00:52,300 --> 05:00:55,820
I was dead.

6445
05:00:56,100 --> 05:01:00,060
Why did everything I killed in the sand still live?

6446
05:01:10,900 --> 05:01:13,700
Yes, me.

6447
05:01:13,860 --> 05:01:16,080
Me, I will kill you in your fucking life.

6448
05:01:18,840 --> 05:01:20,000
Don't say that.

6449
05:01:20,220 --> 05:01:20,800
There's no way.

6450
05:01:20,900 --> 05:01:21,720
There's a face.

6451
05:01:21,760 --> 05:01:22,300
Ew.

6452
05:01:23,880 --> 05:01:25,600
There's no way.

6453
05:01:28,360 --> 05:01:30,000
There's no way.

6454
05:01:30,480 --> 05:01:30,620
There's no way.

6455
05:01:30,620 --> 05:01:31,560
I... whoa.

6456
05:01:32,000 --> 05:01:32,980
Wait, what?

6457
05:01:35,740 --> 05:01:36,620
What?

6458
05:01:37,000 --> 05:01:37,960
That was you?

6459
05:01:41,700 --> 05:01:42,520
Are you...

6460
05:01:45,800 --> 05:01:46,240
What?

6461
05:01:50,170 --> 05:01:51,410
These two?

6462
05:02:01,670 --> 05:02:02,290
What?

6463
05:02:08,170 --> 05:02:08,790
What?

6464
05:02:09,210 --> 05:02:09,450
What?

6465
05:02:10,570 --> 05:02:11,190
What?

6466
05:02:12,070 --> 05:02:13,190
There's no way.

6467
05:02:13,590 --> 05:02:14,550
There's no way.

6468
05:02:14,590 --> 05:02:15,250
Don't say that.

6469
05:02:15,570 --> 05:02:16,930
Is this my sword?

6470
05:02:17,250 --> 05:02:18,030
Is this...

6471
05:02:18,030 --> 05:02:19,390
Don't say that.

6472
05:02:19,430 --> 05:02:20,470
There's no face, too.

6473
05:02:20,730 --> 05:02:22,610
Oh, thank god.

6474
05:02:22,730 --> 05:02:24,510
We fucking did it.

6475
05:02:25,370 --> 05:02:28,010
We fucking did it.

6476
05:02:28,010 --> 05:02:29,910
Oh my god.

6477
05:02:31,790 --> 05:02:32,910
Golden thunder.

6478
05:02:33,150 --> 05:02:35,650
Cast worms into yellow loam.

6479
05:02:35,710 --> 05:02:37,010
Gaining immune shock.

6480
05:02:37,690 --> 05:02:39,150
We did it.

6481
05:02:39,290 --> 05:02:42,250
We actually did it.

6482
05:02:42,430 --> 05:02:44,430
Even with frame drops.

6483
05:02:44,610 --> 05:02:47,030
We didn't need to level up.

6484
05:02:47,290 --> 05:02:48,150
We didn't need to level up.

6485
05:02:48,150 --> 05:02:49,050
I told you guys.

6486
05:02:49,890 --> 05:02:52,510
We didn't need to level up.

6487
05:02:52,910 --> 05:02:53,430
We didn't need to level up.

6488
05:02:53,430 --> 05:02:54,090
Thank you.

6489
05:02:54,090 --> 05:02:56,830
I told you all.

6490
05:02:57,310 --> 05:03:00,150
I told you all.

6491
05:03:00,770 --> 05:03:01,810
I told you all.

6492
05:03:01,810 --> 05:03:03,110
We are gamers.

6493
05:03:04,150 --> 05:03:06,350
We are gamers.

6494
05:03:07,310 --> 05:03:09,010
We are gamers.

6495
05:03:09,010 --> 05:03:09,130
We are gamers.

6496
05:03:09,890 --> 05:03:11,710
Oh my god.

6497
05:03:11,790 --> 05:03:14,650
I didn't even use up all my heals, too.

6498
05:03:15,330 --> 05:03:16,570
I didn't even use up all my heals, too.

6499
05:03:17,830 --> 05:03:19,810
I fucking told you.

6500
05:03:20,050 --> 05:03:22,050
I knew it.

6501
05:03:25,150 --> 05:03:27,130
Oh my god.

6502
05:03:27,230 --> 05:03:29,210
I fucking knew it.

6503
05:03:29,310 --> 05:03:30,530
Oh my god.

6504
05:03:30,530 --> 05:03:32,110
It's even good.

6505
05:03:32,330 --> 05:03:34,750
I don't even know.

6506
05:03:35,030 --> 05:03:36,590
I don't even know.

6507
05:03:39,680 --> 05:03:41,710
Even with frame drops.

6508
05:03:41,910 --> 05:03:43,270
We gamed.

6509
05:03:43,520 --> 05:03:45,810
We fucking gamed.

6510
05:03:45,810 --> 05:03:46,810
We fucking gamed.

6511
05:03:49,230 --> 05:03:51,970
Oh my god.

6512
05:03:52,950 --> 05:03:55,790
We fucking did it.

6513
05:03:56,170 --> 05:03:59,050
We fucking did it.

6514
05:03:59,090 --> 05:03:59,250
We fucking did it.

6515
05:03:59,250 --> 05:04:01,030
I'm so proud of us.

6516
05:04:02,410 --> 05:04:04,890
I'm so proud of us.

6517
05:04:05,030 --> 05:04:05,210
I'm so proud of us.

6518
05:04:05,210 --> 05:04:06,390
I knew it.

6519
05:04:06,910 --> 05:04:08,090
Craft weapon?

6520
05:04:10,350 --> 05:04:11,550
What do I craft?

6521
05:04:14,730 --> 05:04:16,090
I don't have...

6522
05:04:16,090 --> 05:04:17,430
We need one more steel.

6523
05:04:18,970 --> 05:04:19,550
Guys.

6524
05:04:20,830 --> 05:04:21,410
Guys.

6525
05:04:21,430 --> 05:04:22,550
Guys, we need one more steel.

6526
05:04:22,690 --> 05:04:23,570
What do you...

6527
05:04:23,570 --> 05:04:25,850
Where do I get the other steel?

6528
05:04:28,210 --> 05:04:30,830
Where do I get the other steel?

6529
05:04:31,530 --> 05:04:32,090
Where do I get the other steel?

6530
05:04:32,090 --> 05:04:33,150
Could I buy steel?

6531
05:04:34,110 --> 05:04:35,430
Could I buy it?

6532
05:04:35,990 --> 05:04:38,070
Please tell me I can buy it.

6533
05:04:38,110 --> 05:04:38,350
Right?

6534
05:04:39,070 --> 05:04:40,790
I can't buy it.

6535
05:04:40,990 --> 05:04:42,070
Where do I...

6536
05:04:43,790 --> 05:04:44,890
No way.

6537
05:04:46,010 --> 05:04:47,030
Where do we...

6538
05:04:47,430 --> 05:04:49,290
There's no steel anyway.

6539
05:04:49,550 --> 05:04:50,790
What are we doing?

6540
05:04:54,790 --> 05:04:55,590
Oh...

6541
05:04:55,590 --> 05:04:56,710
Oh...

6542
05:04:57,990 --> 05:04:58,790
Oh...

6543
05:04:58,790 --> 05:04:59,610
Oh my god.

6544
05:05:00,130 --> 05:05:01,810
Oh my god.

6545
05:05:02,210 --> 05:05:03,010
Hurry.

6546
05:05:03,270 --> 05:05:04,090
Last spot.

6547
05:05:04,230 --> 05:05:05,670
Okay, we're gonna...

6548
05:05:05,670 --> 05:05:08,790
Can we buy the steel from the tiger?

6549
05:05:09,310 --> 05:05:10,910
Back to the tiger?

6550
05:05:11,250 --> 05:05:11,630
Okay.

6551
05:05:13,130 --> 05:05:13,530
Okay.

6552
05:05:13,530 --> 05:05:15,510
Tiger time.

6553
05:05:16,690 --> 05:05:17,890
Tiger time.

6554
05:05:18,990 --> 05:05:19,910
Tiger time.

6555
05:05:19,910 --> 05:05:20,050
Thank you.

6556
05:05:20,090 --> 05:05:20,870
Thank you.

6557
05:05:23,170 --> 05:05:24,130
Thank you.

6558
05:05:24,310 --> 05:05:25,050
Thank you.

6559
05:05:29,570 --> 05:05:31,730
We did it.

6560
05:05:32,230 --> 05:05:34,230
We did it.

6561
05:05:34,410 --> 05:05:35,830
We did it.

6562
05:05:35,830 --> 05:05:42,390
Was it very noticeable that I was dropping frames like fucking crazy on that boss?

6563
05:05:43,530 --> 05:05:44,830
Like on the last fight?

6564
05:05:45,290 --> 05:05:46,510
Was it...

6565
05:05:46,510 --> 05:05:48,330
Was it pretty noticeable?

6566
05:05:53,210 --> 05:05:54,590
Yeah, yeah.

6567
05:05:54,650 --> 05:05:55,690
The last one.

6568
05:05:56,070 --> 05:05:58,710
I like that like...

6569
05:05:58,710 --> 05:06:00,150
The last time...

6570
05:06:00,150 --> 05:06:03,050
The last time I fight him...

6571
05:06:03,050 --> 05:06:04,150
Oh, he's not even...

6572
05:06:04,150 --> 05:06:04,650
You guys lied.

6573
05:06:05,050 --> 05:06:08,070
Okay, secret.

6574
05:06:08,510 --> 05:06:11,390
Only chapter boss.

6575
05:06:11,390 --> 05:06:12,530
Guys, I'm...

6576
05:06:12,530 --> 05:06:14,110
We're calling it here.

6577
05:06:14,610 --> 05:06:16,690
We're gonna call it here.

6578
05:06:17,050 --> 05:06:17,670
I'm...

6579
05:06:19,250 --> 05:06:20,330
I'm done.

6580
05:06:21,050 --> 05:06:23,090
I'm not done for today.

6581
05:06:23,590 --> 05:06:25,270
I proved a point now.

6582
05:06:25,610 --> 05:06:26,370
Guys...

6583
05:06:26,370 --> 05:06:31,230
For anybody that says I'm not a gamer, I did not over level.

6584
05:06:34,170 --> 05:06:35,690
I beat...

6585
05:06:35,690 --> 05:06:38,030
I beat the fucking...

6586
05:06:38,030 --> 05:06:40,310
I beat the dragon under level.

6587
05:06:40,650 --> 05:06:44,050
Nobody can fucking judge me anymore.

6588
05:06:49,030 --> 05:06:53,210
Now, if we encounter any other boss...

6589
05:06:53,210 --> 05:06:57,610
If we encounter any other boss that means...

6590
05:06:57,610 --> 05:07:01,130
That requires me to level up, I'm going to level up.

6591
05:07:02,550 --> 05:07:05,450
I only need to do it once.

6592
05:07:06,090 --> 05:07:06,890
Okay?

6593
05:07:08,030 --> 05:07:10,450
To the point that I can defeat a boss.

6594
05:07:10,830 --> 05:07:12,750
Even if under level.

6595
05:07:13,130 --> 05:07:14,430
And now...

6596
05:07:14,430 --> 05:07:18,130
Now, I have the privilege to over level now.

6597
05:07:18,530 --> 05:07:18,950
I...

6598
05:07:23,650 --> 05:07:27,470
I now have the privilege to over level.

6599
05:07:27,870 --> 05:07:29,270
If I want to.

6600
05:07:32,630 --> 05:07:33,430
Okay.

6601
05:07:33,830 --> 05:07:35,310
Oh my god.

6602
05:07:35,310 --> 05:07:38,210
Thank you all for the super chats.

6603
05:07:38,570 --> 05:07:39,330
And...

6604
05:07:39,330 --> 05:07:40,590
And...

6605
05:07:40,590 --> 05:07:42,950
I really appreciate it.

6606
05:07:43,490 --> 05:07:43,890
Um...

6607
05:07:43,890 --> 05:07:45,350
Thank you for the super chat.

6608
05:07:45,430 --> 05:07:46,110
Thank you, thank you.

6609
05:07:46,170 --> 05:07:47,550
That was really a fight.

6610
05:07:47,730 --> 05:07:50,090
They threw everything at me.

6611
05:07:50,250 --> 05:07:52,770
From frame drops to everything.

6612
05:07:52,790 --> 05:07:55,530
They threw so many things at me.

6613
05:07:55,710 --> 05:07:57,750
I can't believe the...

6614
05:07:57,750 --> 05:07:59,890
The time I beat the boss.

6615
05:08:00,150 --> 05:08:03,230
When I was frame dropping so fucking hard.

6616
05:08:03,510 --> 05:08:04,090
Like...

6617
05:08:05,310 --> 05:08:05,530
I...

6618
05:08:05,530 --> 05:08:09,570
I can't believe that's when I fucking beat him.

6619
05:08:09,810 --> 05:08:10,310
I...

6620
05:08:11,290 --> 05:08:14,130
Like even I was frame dropping.

6621
05:08:15,550 --> 05:08:16,630
Holy shit.

6622
05:08:17,050 --> 05:08:17,930
Alright guys.

6623
05:08:18,310 --> 05:08:19,410
I game through the...

6624
05:08:19,410 --> 05:08:20,570
I'm gonna call it here everybody.

6625
05:08:21,010 --> 05:08:24,150
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

6626
05:08:24,390 --> 05:08:25,290
As always everybody.

6627
05:08:25,510 --> 05:08:26,570
Stay hydrated.

6628
05:08:26,970 --> 05:08:27,730
Posture check.

6629
05:08:27,770 --> 05:08:29,970
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6630
05:08:29,970 --> 05:08:31,930
And if you stayed up for me.

6631
05:08:32,110 --> 05:08:33,210
Hit the bed.

6632
05:08:33,350 --> 05:08:34,570
Cause you deserve it.

6633
05:08:34,670 --> 05:08:36,230
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6634
05:08:36,850 --> 05:08:37,730
Bye guys.

6635
05:08:38,050 --> 05:08:38,590
Bye bye.
