1
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,350
Good morning everybody!

2
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,110
I am... I'm still waking up.

3
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,010
Oh my gosh.

4
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,450
I need 12.30 to stream.

5
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,870
I can't believe I used to stream at 12pm.

6
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,910
Like what the fuck was wrong with me?

7
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,610
I could barely be awake at 12.30.

8
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:13,170
I remember when I used to stream at 12pm and then I was like, I can't guys.

9
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,490
My body is not strong enough for this.

10
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,050
Not ignoring my mind.

11
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,790
And that was like 12.30.

12
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,350
I was like, what?

13
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,830
Oh my god.

14
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,950
Who would have thought 30 minutes does no difference at all.

15
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,650
My body is still so weak.

16
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,630
Good morning everybody.

17
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,470
I'm so excited to play part 2 of Sandland!

18
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,730
I wanna do like, before we start, I wanna do a huge shoutout to Bandai.

19
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:00,390
For also giving us, I believe, 6 codes for Sandland.

20
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,510
2 for PC, 2 for Playstation, and 2 for Xbox.

21
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:17,150
So, if you somehow got the playstation, and you don't have a playstation, well, uh, that, well...

22
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,430
Actually, you couldn't because you have to activate that code on your playstation!

23
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:36,010
So, at the end of the stream, I would highly, I would be giving out these codes at the end of the stream.

24
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,510
So what I'll be doing is that I'll just be pasting the codes.

25
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,110
I'll just give a countdown for all you guys.

26
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,090
And I'd be like, pasting the codes in chat at the end of the stream.

27
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,190
And it just says playstation codes and xbox codes.

28
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,090
So I assume that like, it works on either.

29
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,730
I assume, okay?

30
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,750
So like, all you have to do, cause like, playstation 5 has like, uh, what's the word called?

31
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,550
It has like, uh, backwards compatibility for playstation 4.

32
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:12,510
So like, all you have to do is just, um, at the end of the stream, just have your playstation, playstation or xbox out in advance.

33
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,070
So like, you can like, fight for the code.

34
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,830
It's basically whoever puts the code down the fastest, um, would basically activate it.

35
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:30,650
So, so all you have to do is just have your fucking playstation xbox ready to activate the code on your console.

36
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,510
So, uh, and it's just whoever activates it first gets the game.

37
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,950
Miracle, thank you for the super chat.

38
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,950
Thank you, thank you.

39
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,710
Uh, but yes!

40
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,890
Uh, so it'll be two PC codes, two playstation codes, and two xbox codes.

41
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,730
Uh, again, like a huge shoutout for Bandai for giving us these codes.

42
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,790
As well as the collectors, uh, sending me a collector's edition of the game.

43
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,450
I really honestly did not expect it.

44
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,030
I don't know if you guys know this, but like, Bandai was like one of the games I couldn't really play back then.

45
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,010
Uh, because, you know, perms.

46
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,230
So, I was like, super surprised.

47
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,810
Not gonna lie, I was so surprised with how supportive they've been, uh, with Sandland.

48
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,550
And how supportive they've been of me, like, playing, like, a lot of their other games.

49
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,490
Because I've always wanted to play, like, Digimon games.

50
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,350
Um, before then, but I couldn't.

51
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,670
So, like, it's really, really, I'm really thankful for Bandai.

52
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,810
Uh, to like, you know.

53
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,250
Supporting me, be like, encouraging me to play more Bandai games as well.

54
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,810
So, yeah, thank you again.

55
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,230
I really appreciate it.

56
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,090
Because, like, that means I can finally play, like, Digimon World.

57
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,530
Like...

58
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,790
I've always wanted to play...

59
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,550
I've always wanted to play Digimon World.

60
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,510
And I'm so happy.

61
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,990
I'll actually be able to, like, try it out in the future.

62
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,930
Uh, who's Doki's Digimon favorite?

63
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,530
My favorite has to be either...

64
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,610
Uh, Terriormon.

65
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,770
Uh...

66
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,950
Terriormon, Gabumon.

67
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,350
And also, uh, Renamon.

68
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,270
Uh, honestly, like, Gen 3 of Digimon...

69
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,350
What is it called?

70
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,010
Gen 3?

71
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,490
I don't remember.

72
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,210
It was Series 3.

73
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,470
Series 3 of Digimon is, like, the most optimal Digimon designs.

74
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,730
In my opinion.

75
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,390
Um, the only, like, Digimon designs...

76
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,450
Oh, Gatomon too.

77
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,110
I really love Gatomon as well.

78
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,690
Gatomon, uh, Terriormon, Renamon, uh, Gabumon...

79
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,510
And I think that's really it.

80
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,870
Um, but, like, I'm gonna say...

81
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,170
Gabumon fell down in my love for his design.

82
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,010
Because I've talked about this before.

83
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,650
But I realized...

84
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,190
Um, he's wearing a skinned animal.

85
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,630
I just... I realized.

86
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,430
Like, if you guys didn't notice.

87
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,990
He's not actually, like...

88
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,010
The fucking thing he has on top of him...

89
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,810
Is, like, his fur.

90
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,970
It's not even his fur.

91
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,590
And then you take it off.

92
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,070
It looks so ugly.

93
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,490
Like, people were like, What does it look like underneath?

94
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,890
And then I, like, looked up, like...

95
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,550
Like, they're, like, fan designs of what's underneath Gabumon.

96
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,630
And I'm...

97
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,430
And every time I looked at it, I...

98
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,910
It just ruined Gabumon for me.

99
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,830
I just... I just can't.

100
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,430
I can't take, like, Gabumon seriously.

101
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,890
Knowing, like, what it could look like underneath.

102
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,390
And it's just...

103
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,330
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,410
He's so ugly.

105
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,990
He's just...

106
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,870
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,350
Like, the...

108
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,730
The...

109
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,450
The...

110
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,110
Without the pelt, he's so ugly.

111
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,470
And I can't...

112
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,210
Like, change my love for Gabumon.

113
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,310
Because all I can think about is what's underneath the pelt.

114
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,430
Well, okay.

115
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,250
You guys don't know?

116
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:00,830
Okay, here.

117
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,490
Here.

118
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,010
This is, like, what people think Gabumon looks like.

119
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,290
Because he has a double chin.

120
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,250
I don't know if you guys noticed.

121
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,330
But, like, the pelt hides the fact that he has, like, a double chin.

122
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,670
So, it looks so weird.

123
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,230
It looks so weird without the pelt.

124
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,590
Because then it's, like...

125
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,790
It, like, accentuates the double chin.

126
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,110
And I'm, like, oh...

127
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,430
Poor Gabumon.

128
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,050
Like, look at this.

129
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,870
Like, what the fuck is this?

130
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,730
Like, look.

131
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,710
There's a double chin.

132
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,350
What do you mean double?

133
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,770
Look.

134
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,810
It's right here.

135
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,470
Do you not see it?

136
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,070
It's right here.

137
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,990
I'm not crazy.

138
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,610
It's literally right here.

139
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,970
That's why he's so cute.

140
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,830
Okay.

141
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,230
Yeah, it's like a guy that shaves off his beard.

142
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,650
So, that's just a lie.

143
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,430
That's a fan design.

144
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,550
It doesn't count.

145
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,910
It won't hide the fact...

146
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,270
It won't hide his chin.

147
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,410
Like, his chin was the only thing that's exposed.

148
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,270
Anyway...

149
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,010
Anyway.

150
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,690
No matter what, we all know what's underneath is not as cute as what's, like, what he has.

151
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:26,890
Like...

152
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,130
Like...

153
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,230
Like...

154
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,410
But yeah, anyway, I used to really like Gobblemon.

155
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,550
And uh...

156
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,190
Joki is a didgy shamer.

157
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,270
Anyway, as I was saying, I used to really like Gobblemon.

158
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,630
But then my whole love for Gobblemon basically died.

159
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,070
He's still in my top 5 designs.

160
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:58,490
It's just that, you know, I realized he wasn't as cute as I thought he was.

161
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,010
Because all the cute factor comes from the thing he's wearing.

162
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,630
So...

163
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,370
So I was just like, oh...

164
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,430
I was just in love with the fur design.

165
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,270
I was in love with him.

166
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,710
And he died!

167
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,030
It's not even his fur!

168
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,930
That's the thing!

169
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,790
It's not even his fur.

170
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,170
So like, I'm not even in love with him.

171
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,870
It's like I was in love with what he was wearing.

172
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,830
So it's not really him.

173
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,370
He basically like skinned somebody else's fur and put it on top of him.

174
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,970
So whichever fur that came from...

175
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,610
That's the design I'm in love with.

176
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,290
You only liked him for his fur.

177
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,110
Damn right!

178
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,130
I'm not fucking ashamed of that!

179
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,870
I...

180
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,710
JL, thank you for the super chat.

181
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,570
Thank you, thank you.

182
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,070
I can't believe my Kamiyoshi exposing Gobblemon like that.

183
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,850
Thank you for the super chat.

184
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,010
Thank you, thank you.

185
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,550
But yeah, I'm really thankful for Bandai for reaching out and...

186
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,850
And supporting this playthrough!

187
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,510
I don't know if you guys saw, but like...

188
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,850
You guys all know, this is actually the very last game that Toriyama was involved in.

189
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,750
So like, as I say, playing this game is sort of like a...

190
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,910
Like a lowkey tribute to him.

191
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,730
And everything.

192
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,290
But this was like the last game he was actually like...

193
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,910
Publicly involved in.

194
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,530
And they even like put up...

195
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,510
He even had like a statement written for this game.

196
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,810
Before he passed away.

197
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,030
I was like reading the statement and he was like really proud of this game.

198
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,630
And like really proud of like the world that was developed for this game.

199
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,810
Because there's like stuff that's not in the manga.

200
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,090
That like they added in.

201
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,730
And things that he wanted to be added to the manga.

202
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,530
That like they ended up adding in the game for.

203
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,530
So I'm really looking forward to playing more of Sand Land.

204
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,470
I'm really looking forward.

205
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,610
Anyway guys!

206
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,930
Let us start the game!

207
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,270
I played around the volume a little bit more.

208
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,610
Last... not last night.

209
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,590
Last playthrough before we ended the playthrough.

210
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,130
So I don't know if Sound Guy is here at the moment.

211
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,510
Uh yes.

212
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,850
You must return.

213
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,710
Do you wish to... yes.

214
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,650
Okay it's gonna be in Japanese now.

215
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,190
I hope you guys are happy.

216
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,030
You guys know the reason why I play in English is so that I don't have to read.

217
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:35,850
Like...

218
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,670
I won't be reading it out loud to you guys.

219
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,130
Okay?

220
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,690
All I'm saying is that you voted for Japanese.

221
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,650
So I will not be reading out the English dialogue.

222
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,330
Like...

223
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:52,750
Like you...

224
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,530
It's like subs versus dubs now.

225
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,310
Alright.

226
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,710
Continue.

227
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,470
Why?

228
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,310
Cause you guys voted for the Japanese dub!

229
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,550
What do you mean what...

230
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,590
Why not?

231
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,010
You guys had a choice!

232
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,450
Alright.

233
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,410
Let us go.

234
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,910
I... I never fucking remember how to play this game.

235
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,470
Alright.

236
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,410
How does she sound like?

237
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,350
Oh look.

238
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:22,730
It was a girl.

239
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:22,910
She's in garage.

240
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,310
Alright.

241
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:24,950
This is like...

242
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,570
Wait.

243
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,950
Do I have to upgrade my stuff again?

244
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,930
Did I upgrade anything?

245
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,930
I don't remember.

246
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,010
No!

247
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,290
Okay.

248
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,050
Give me a sec.

249
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,810
I'm gonna load game.

250
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,610
Give me a sec.

251
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,010
I'm pretty sure I saved it.

252
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,710
Right?

253
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,890
Load game.

254
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,050
A jump bot?

255
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:45,670
Wait.

256
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,150
Did I not?

257
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,190
Oh fuck.

258
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,430
I forgot to save it.

259
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,150
Okay.

260
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,590
Guys.

261
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,950
I forgot to save after upgrading my fucking tank.

262
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,810
Okay.

263
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:58,970
We got to...

264
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,610
Alright.

265
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,870
Did I upgrade my parts at least?

266
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,230
No I didn't!

267
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,630
Oh my god.

268
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,430
Okay.

269
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,030
Here we go.

270
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:07,770
Here we go again.

271
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,910
Alright.

272
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,670
I know we upgraded this.

273
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,290
Like I remember that.

274
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:14,930
Okay.

275
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,510
Alright.

276
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,070
Customized vehicle.

277
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,850
Uh...

278
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,550
How do I...

279
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:21,750
Okay.

280
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,030
Oh I can rename it!

281
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:23,890
Alright.

282
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,990
We're gonna rename our vehicle.

283
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,610
Uh...

284
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,050
How do I go...

285
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,210
What the fuck?

286
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,670
How do I...

287
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,830
I have to rename it on my...

288
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,750
Oh I have to rename it here.

289
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,850
Dragoons 1.

290
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,970
That means there might be a Dragoons 2.

291
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,070
The possibility that there's a Dragoon 2.

292
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,850
Alright.

293
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:53,570
Let's see.

294
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,470
Can I upgrade...

295
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,470
Uh...

296
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,030
Vehicle.

297
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,290
Upgrade vehicle.

298
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,430
Alright.

299
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,550
Let's see.

300
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,250
I'm gonna upgrade the vehicle.

301
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,450
Try to see soon.

302
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,710
Alright.

303
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,310
Vehicle level.

304
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,670
Oh I can go all the way.

305
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,130
Let's go.

306
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:08,630
Whoa!

307
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,350
I have so...

308
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:10,670
Okay.

309
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,650
I don't have anymore.

310
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,690
I was gonna say...

311
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,010
Whoa!

312
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,530
I have so much stuff!

313
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,630
Oh my gosh.

314
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,630
I can't believe I didn't realize that...

315
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,830
That has...

316
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,350
I have like...

317
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,410
To upgrade these parts as well.

318
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,210
Alright.

319
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:24,670
Let's see.

320
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,050
Oh wait.

321
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,990
Customize vehicle.

322
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,610
Chip slot.

323
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,670
What did I want?

324
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,010
Power?

325
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,130
It was power, right?

326
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,290
Yeah.

327
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,830
Power chip.

328
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,610
Okay.

329
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,410
Here we go.

330
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,990
Uh...

331
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,990
Upgrade.

332
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,470
Uh...

333
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,330
Okay.

334
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,770
I upgraded all of these.

335
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,970
Upgrade part.

336
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,410
Upgrade vehicle.

337
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,610
Uh...

338
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,730
Can these be upgraded?

339
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,150
Can these be upgraded?

340
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,010
Can these be upgraded?

341
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,410
Can these be upgraded?

342
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:50,810
Can these be upgraded?

343
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,690
Choose a part.

344
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:51,990
Okay.

345
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:53,950
Wait.

346
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,370
What?

347
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,270
Upgrading the wrong thing?

348
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,130
No.

349
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,330
I didn't.

350
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,610
Okay.

351
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,170
I did not.

352
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,590
Okay.

353
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,090
I just...

354
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,270
Oh shit.

355
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:04,650
Okay.

356
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,490
Give me a sec.

357
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,490
Okay.

358
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,750
No.

359
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,150
I didn't.

360
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:10,710
Oh thank god.

361
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,030
Okay.

362
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,670
I did not upgrade the wrong part.

363
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,490
I just have to be sure.

364
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,210
I just...

365
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,650
I just have to be sure.

366
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,810
Reload time.

367
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,950
Attack interval.

368
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,950
I feel like...

369
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,390
Doesn't...

370
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,590
They both are very similar.

371
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:20,810
Okay.

372
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,410
Let's see here.

373
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,170
Uh...

374
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,150
Upgrade.

375
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,690
There you go.

376
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,090
Okay.

377
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,210
I've already upgraded that.

378
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,470
Alright.

379
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,790
Nice.

380
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,150
Alright.

381
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:29,470
We're good.

382
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,810
Select vehicle?

383
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,890
Oh yeah!

384
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,530
I should have a jumper right now.

385
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,870
Right?

386
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,670
Where's my jumper?

387
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,450
No.

388
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:37,790
I don't.

389
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,390
Dragoon 2 would be the jump...

390
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,350
The jump one.

391
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,710
The jump tank.

392
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:42,810
Alright.

393
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,150
Alright.

394
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,710
Here we go.

395
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,930
Let's see.

396
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,750
I gotta talk to this guy now.

397
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,270
Alright.

398
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,030
And then...

399
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,570
Can I save here?

400
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,170
Save data.

401
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:55,550
Okay.

402
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,030
There you go.

403
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,130
Oh my god.

404
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:57,490
I...

405
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,970
I never saved.

406
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,450
I just...

407
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,830
I just relied on auto save.

408
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,750
Alright.

409
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,530
Uh...

410
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:05,870
Fill in.

411
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,950
Think of a 10 gift of ships.

412
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,210
Thank you.

413
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:07,750
Thank you.

414
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,850
A request?

415
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,750
He wants me to do shit again?

416
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,230
Machine gun scrapped is what I need.

417
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,010
Oh.

418
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:20,710
I'm gonna need a machine gun.

419
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,790
I'm gonna need a machine gun.

420
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:33,150
Ah, a shooting target!

421
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,530
Oh my god!

422
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,210
What?

423
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,550
Did that work?

424
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:35,550
Oh.

425
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,570
So it worked.

426
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,070
No, that didn't work.

427
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:39,370
What?

428
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,230
That was oh my... What the...

429
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,310
Where's my...

430
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:41,590
These things don't feel right.

431
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,990
You know what I mean?

432
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:42,110
This is the best part of time... Your windows aren't any better.

433
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,110
projet.

434
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,770
At least uh...

435
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,470
They're running a bounty on me at the moment.

436
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,450
But it's okay if they housed me, I guess.

437
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,630
We don't want to bring ourselves attention to the army.

438
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,090
But anyway, feel free to live in this place.

439
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,770
Oh my god, money!

440
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,770
I love doing things for money.

441
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,670
That's my job!

442
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,010
Alright, let's see.

443
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,090
We wanna...

444
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,250
Oh hey, they fixed it!

445
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,330
I just realized.

446
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,150
Okay, max the master volume.

447
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,650
Okay.

448
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,550
Got you.

449
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,750
I like how they fixed the...

450
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,410
I don't know if you guys remember, but we had an issue on launch where everything was just...

451
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,570
...flickering.

452
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,630
So, you know, it's good that they fixed that!

453
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,510
They actually fixed it!

454
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,650
Give the machine... Oh, I already did it!

455
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,010
Oh.

456
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,710
Did I do it already?

457
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,190
Obtain some machine gun...

458
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,570
Mayor, I did it!

459
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,290
I'll fix it!

460
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,150
I was fixing my settings!

461
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,070
But I did your job, Mayor!

462
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,630
It was so easy.

463
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,950
Yay!

464
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,050
Red Hammer, welcome to the tomato farm!

465
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,650
Welcome, welcome!

466
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,610
Okay.

467
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:17,850
Okay.

468
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,870
Okay, he has everything he needs.

469
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,690
Oh, I get to keep it?

470
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,710
Nice.

471
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,830
I got to keep the rest.

472
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,330
Isn't that great?

473
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,350
I did it, guys!

474
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,190
All I did was look at my menu and I completed my job!

475
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,370
I wish things were that easy.

476
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,850
Ha ha ha!

477
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,130
I'm still not sure if you'll have to stay.

478
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,750
What?

479
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,030
The town of Spino is a sinking ship.

480
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,010
I've been a butterfly for a long time.

481
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,450
It's a sinking ship?

482
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,510
What do you mean by that?

483
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,230
I thought this was like a utopia.

484
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,710
Young people like you haven't dated...

485
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,070
That butterfly...

486
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,330
Don't say things like you've given up...

487
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,370
If we all work together...

488
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:07,890
There's still...

489
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,270
What?

490
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,450
What's going on?

491
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,710
No!

492
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,490
How can it fail?

493
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,010
It has a population of like five people.

494
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,430
I don't understand!

495
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,810
No!

496
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:38,810
Seriously?

497
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,990
We can't repair the tank!

498
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,290
I'm sorry to walk and travel.

499
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,430
No!

500
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,790
We'll just deconstruct the garage and reconstruct it later!

501
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:01,170
There's only like two kids in this town.

502
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,350
For an old friend's son and wife to look after them.

503
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,550
I'm sorry I didn't ask you.

504
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,050
I didn't want to be a burden to you when you left the town.

505
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,510
I know.

506
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,290
I didn't want to leave as long as you were here.

507
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,370
But isn't that the same for you and Purika?

508
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,950
Wait, who's you and Purika?

509
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,930
Is that the kids?

510
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,850
I'm sorry, I forgot the names.

511
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,150
Oh, so it's like...

512
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,790
Just tell them...

513
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,510
Tell them like...

514
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,750
Grandpa hates them.

515
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,890
Then they'll understand.

516
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,230
It's a lie, but it will be a good lie.

517
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,890
You want the kids to die in this town?

518
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,030
That's so fucked up, lady!

519
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,990
Oh shit.

520
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,690
I like how these guys are just listening in to this very private conversation.

521
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:03,790
Hahaha!

522
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,570
I... I... I...

523
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,710
I like how they're just listening in and just standing there and being...

524
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,650
listening to this family drama like some fucking television show.

525
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,630
Then you should take me from some town.

526
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,830
This town used to be the base of the rebel army.

527
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,930
Now it's a place where the people from the country...

528
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,130
Oh, so they don't have food or water.

529
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,610
That's why this town is dying.

530
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,090
To be fair, there's like no young people in this town except for that one lady.

531
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,930
There's not many people who will move here.

532
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:36,950
There's not many people who will move here.

533
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,650
Good listeners.

534
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,830
Well, then I guess I have no choice.

535
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,050
Hmm...

536
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,450
Do you know the princess?

537
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,670
She's been telling us about the good things of the town.

538
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,870
Does it help?

539
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,150
It doesn't even help.

540
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,690
It's just an ear.

541
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,910
Nobody moves in.

542
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,690
I'm going to make you feel better.

543
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,230
But they're like, oh, we want to attract more people to spin you.

544
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,030
But it doesn't help.

545
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,110
There's no new people coming in.

546
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,310
That's the whole problem.

547
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,910
They're not doing anything.

548
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,690
There's no new people.

549
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,590
Even if they're like, oh, this town is amazing.

550
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,830
We don't have food or water.

551
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,350
No matter how you gas up this town, it doesn't work.

552
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,210
Because there's no fucking food or water.

553
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,210
Let's tough it out just a little longer, Mare.

554
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,310
This is fucked up logic.

555
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,830
That doesn't solve the food problem.

556
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,270
Yes?

557
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:00,830
Hmm.

558
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,850
Oh my god, we're gonna help!

559
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,530
We're gonna do our job!

560
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,550
Alright, nice.

561
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,670
The demon king shall help.

562
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,650
Because that's what we know about the demons.

563
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,290
They love helping people.

564
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,530
Oh, the jump butt!

565
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,610
Oh, so how's the sound sound guy?

566
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,390
Yes!

567
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,270
They don't know who we really are?

568
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,530
I don't know, man.

569
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,210
A pink boy... is a very like...

570
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,570
Is a very like specific description, sir.

571
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,290
We're looking for a boy that's fucking pink.

572
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,190
Don't be scared of the demon.

573
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,390
But, prince... I'll keep looking for Izumi.

574
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,990
I can't just leave like this.

575
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,070
I'll help you.

576
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,270
I'll tell you what, I won't leave until I see Izumi with my own eyes.

577
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:27,930
Alright.

578
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,690
If you don't like it that much, you can leave.

579
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,750
No way...

580
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,710
If I leave the prince, what will people say?

581
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,310
Don't be like, you fucking failed, old man.

582
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,790
I hope you guys are like reading in time with the exact same time as me.

583
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,530
And I'm not going too fast.

584
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:59,350
I don't know how I'm reading is fast and is like too fast or not.

585
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,050
If you complete the Jump Mecha, you'll find Izumi.

586
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,830
I'm not reading.

587
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,050
What a girl with a kimono.

588
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,190
Let's see what... whoa.

589
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,410
Oh, we're back here.

590
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,750
I'm glad you left the Jump Mecha to me.

591
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,810
Alright, she's working on the jump battle on her own.

592
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,030
Oh, that's right.

593
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,870
She's kept me company for the entire time you helped me.

594
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,770
Oh, she's right.

595
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,430
The Jump Mecha.

596
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,150
Is it your用語?

597
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:46,690
Yes.

598
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,010
That's right.

599
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,630
I'm using the Jump Mecha.

600
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:53,830
Let's try to use it as a reference for our next show.

601
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,050
All right.

602
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,610
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

603
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:55,930
Oh, no no no no no.

604
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,050
You, you came back?

605
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:57,250
Yes.

606
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,750
So, you're the first person who comes back?

607
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:58,790
I'm not.

608
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,710
This is...

609
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,710
old!

610
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,790
Wait, we fucking saw this before!

611
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,430
Wait, did they let me like, I fucking eavesdrop before?

612
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,490
Wait, this is the same!

613
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,190
I didn't even realize we've seen this cutscene!

614
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,710
Did we not?

615
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,230
Did we?

616
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,110
Okay, I saw this.

617
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,930
Sorry, we're skipping.

618
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,230
We saw this!

619
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,430
Wait a minute.

620
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,310
Alright, we're gonna skip.

621
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,150
We don't need a recap, guys.

622
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,670
It's gonna be like the Netflix, like, skip the intro.

623
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:10,070
I was like, wait a minute, I remember this.

624
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,810
It was him!

625
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:22,950
Alright, we see how it's different from like the original voice acting.

626
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,790
Not the English voice acting.

627
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,790
Previously on Sandland.

628
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:37,690
And...

629
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:48,430
Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

630
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,170
Guys, if you want... Oh my god, there it is.

631
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,670
I was like, where's the actual skip button?

632
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,030
Alright, here we go.

633
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,370
We can rewatch the scene.

634
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,850
Alright, bets on if I'll crash or not.

635
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,340
Guys, if you were like, Tokyo, why did you watch this scene?

636
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,360
Literally just play the last, like, five minutes of my vibe from the first playthrough.

637
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,490
But we only know how it sounds in English!

638
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,430
The Pitchers developed a machine that makes water.

639
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,310
The real devil is...

640
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,770
The real fiend here.

641
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
It's actually... me!

642
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,420
That's right, you're a fucking war criminal.

643
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,460
Live and die with your guilt.

644
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,070
Absorb.

645
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,270
Welcome to the Toriyama Cinematic Universe.

646
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,130
I'm gonna turn into a giant monkey now.

647
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,500
Alright, here we go.

648
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,560
This is where I crashed.

649
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,940
Maybe they patched it.

650
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,880
Maybe they patched it?

651
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,380
Oh, thank god.

652
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:33,760
.

653
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,780
Oh, thank god.

654
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,580
I was like, oh please don't be the Doki Jinx.

655
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,780
And it actually crashed.

656
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,300
I half expected it to crash.

657
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,300
Not gonna lie.

658
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,140
I was like, oh no.

659
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,620
I might have jinxed it.

660
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,880
Alright, sound guy, up the volume again.

661
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,920
Let me know if it's better.

662
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,060
Then go to the suspense.

663
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,980
I know, I was like, uh-huh.

664
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,180
Uh-huh.

665
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,780
Oh, oh!

666
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,940
Okay, sorry.

667
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,140
Now I remember...

668
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,080
Now I remember why we never saved.

669
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,420
It didn't crash, but at what cost?

670
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,020
It was a car.

671
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,460
That's not the jump bot.

672
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,120
Yeah, I was gonna say, you made a car?

673
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,020
.

674
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,800
.

675
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,020
.

676
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,660
.

677
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:39,720
.

678
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:39,780
.

679
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:39,920
.

680
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,140
.

681
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,100
.

682
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,160
.

683
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,220
.

684
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,260
.

685
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,320
.

686
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,820
.

687
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:42,860
.

688
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:42,880
.

689
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:42,940
.

690
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,540
.

691
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:53,740
You were just, I don't know.

692
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,800
You were going in the sand land.

693
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,760
People were fucking killed at that point.

694
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,200
It's literally anime Mad Max!

695
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:00,820
.

696
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,920
Of course.

697
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,520
.

698
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:19,980
.

699
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,100
Yay!

700
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,800
I got my car back!

701
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,760
Oh shit, I get to have my own car?

702
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,920
Say no more.

703
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,200
Say less.

704
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,480
Yeah, they stole my fucking dinosaur too.

705
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,860
I can't believe I got GTD'd.

706
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,400
Oh shit, you're right!

707
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,440
Where's our jump bot?

708
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,680
I really love the 3D models on these.

709
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,060
They look so... they look like... they really look 2D and 3D at the same time.

710
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,840
I know, right?

711
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,260
Wait, I'm not gonna lose my car.

712
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,880
Wait, I'm not gonna lose my car.

713
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:29,960
You're gonna lose your car?

714
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,220
You're gonna lose your car?

715
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:36,540
Yeah.

716
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,480
I'm not gonna lose my car.

717
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,120
I'm not gonna lose my car.

718
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,820
You know what I'm just happy about?

719
00:33:52,020 --> 00:34:05,420
I am so fucking happy that like for an anime adaptation of a game for like a game adapted from a anime slash manga That's not a fucking fighting game I am tired!

720
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,740
I am tired of game adaptation!

721
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,060
That's just a fighting game.

722
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,320
I don't care what anybody says.

723
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,460
I'm so fucking tired of it.

724
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,680
There's a whole world!

725
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,720
We need more anime fighting games.

726
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,080
Bro, that's basically like 90% of Dragon Ball Z games.

727
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,540
But at least it makes sense because it's Dragon Ball Z.

728
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,340
There's some fucking anime fighting games that don't fucking make sense at all.

729
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,940
Alright, let's see.

730
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,320
Let me push the overall volume a little bit more guys.

731
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,320
Sound guy requested!

732
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,500
Alright, I pushed it up.

733
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,520
Let me know if that's better.

734
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,100
...

735
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,220
...

736
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,840
Guys, I'm like this close to having like in like...

737
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm putting it back in English.

738
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,860
...

739
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,660
...

740
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,820
...

741
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,060
...

742
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,360
I'm tired of reading already.

743
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,900
...

744
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,380
...

745
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,320
...

746
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,260
...

747
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,420
...

748
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:41,760
...

749
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,660
...

750
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,700
Okay, alright.

751
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,740
We've had...

752
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,920
We've had...

753
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,940
We got our Japanese...

754
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,800
I'm sorry guys.

755
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,300
I'm just not as strong.

756
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,380
...

757
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,660
Reading is so hard.

758
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,780
...

759
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,980
...

760
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,620
...

761
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,340
I'm like reading and also trying to think at the same time.

762
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:10,680
...

763
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,840
I haven't done that since university.

764
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,880
...

765
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm too tired to right now.

766
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,040
...

767
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,220
Finally I don't have to read!

768
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:22,880
...

769
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,440
Finally!

770
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,460
Gladstone don't!

771
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,100
Oh, a little bit too late there.

772
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,040
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

773
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,040
Thank you, thank you.

774
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,880
...

775
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,520
Reading the game and reading the chat.

776
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,200
There's just too much reading going on.

777
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,580
My brain just can't.

778
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,500
...

779
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,820
It lasted 36 minutes.

780
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,320
I did... I don't think it was even 36.

781
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,780
Because there was like a time where we had to do other stuff.

782
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,980
Alright, here we go.

783
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,400
Back at...

784
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,640
We have to assemble the...

785
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,000
We have to go back and forth?

786
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,520
...

787
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,670
Yay!

788
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,910
We did it!

789
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:03,970
...

790
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,910
Now we have the jump bot!

791
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:10,890
...

792
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,230
...

793
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,590
Make the necessary parts.

794
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,230
I have money!

795
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,370
How do I do this?

796
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,190
Make a part.

797
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,650
You need money materials to make parts.

798
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,750
Select the vehicle type with LB and select part to make.

799
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,070
Choose and build.

800
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:26,710
Okay.

801
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,530
Oh, there it is.

802
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,950
Uh... We need this.

803
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:32,730
...

804
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,950
Okay, we got that.

805
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,630
And then we need to make this.

806
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:39,490
Nice.

807
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,090
I knew being a loot goblin was the way to go.

808
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:42,950
No!

809
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,090
I need a fucking scorpion oil and raptor steel?

810
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:47,990
I'm too lazy.

811
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,930
I'll fucking... I'll go with default.

812
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,910
I don't want to farm.

813
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,770
I'm too fucking lazy for that.

814
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,090
I think that's it, right?

815
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,490
I made it.

816
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,630
Did I make everything?

817
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,630
You should be made.

818
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,930
Did I not make you?

819
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,510
Did I not make you?

820
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,050
Oh, go to make vehicle.

821
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,150
Okay, vehicle.

822
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,410
Make vehicle.

823
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:19,970
Alright.

824
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,190
Nice.

825
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:21,530
Okay.

826
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,630
Once you have what parts are required, go to make parts.

827
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,490
Okay, I did it.

828
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,810
Alright, nice.

829
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,570
So let's start to create...

830
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,690
Okay, create part four.

831
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,010
Once I set up slots...

832
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:32,230
Okay.

833
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,250
Nice.

834
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,350
I made you.

835
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,030
You can never leave...

836
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,030
when you live under this house.

837
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,090
Alright.

838
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:43,950
Assemble.

839
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:47,990
Alright.

840
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,310
Dragoon.

841
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,890
Better dragoon.

842
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,710
Two.

843
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,910
There we go.

844
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,210
Why couldn't you be just like my better dragoon?

845
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,110
Dragoons.

846
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,910
Why couldn't you be just like...

847
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,130
I can't.

848
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,630
See you later.

849
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,790
Did I make it?

850
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:14,790
Dragoon.

851
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,290
I can't believe you really made it.

852
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:19,850
I did.

853
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,330
What you talking about?

854
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,190
You didn't think she could?

855
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,050
I'll be honest.

856
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,270
I had my doubts.

857
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,630
You must have had a fine mentor.

858
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,250
Alright, so I get how's the voices now.

859
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:37,870
No mentor for me.

860
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,890
I'm completely self-taught.

861
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,430
She watched those YouTube videos.

862
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,130
I can't think of what I could have here and there.

863
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,630
I can't think of what I could have here and there.

864
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:43,890
I can't think of what I could have here and there.

865
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,190
There's just always been a lot for me to tinker around with.

866
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,950
Incredible.

867
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:57,630
In any case, this should allow us to slip past the army and continue on our journey south.

868
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,530
Yeah!

869
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,350
We can jump now.

870
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:01,990
I don't know.

871
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,710
This does not look like sneaky.

872
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,310
I don't know.

873
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,910
When can I upgrade my fucking cheese?

874
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,150
I don't care.

875
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,070
What happened to the Japanese dub?

876
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,910
I got tired of reading.

877
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,090
It's too early in the morning for me.

878
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,970
What for?

879
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:38,890
We're at a scout?

880
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,490
I want to see what the army might be able to throw at us.

881
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,410
Oh, we're gonna test it out?

882
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,910
Okay.

883
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,770
Wait, is there more talking?

884
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,110
And we talk like every day.

885
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,630
What else do you want?

886
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,350
When can I customize my fucking...

887
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,630
Uh...

888
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,430
When can I customize my like fucking...

889
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:00,930
Like...

890
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,670
Wait, what do I want to customize?

891
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,690
Oh, my town!

892
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,010
Sorry, I lost my train of thought.

893
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,090
This is exactly why we have to put it back at English.

894
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,010
I actually lost my train of thought in the middle of thinking about it.

895
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,450
Yeah, her.

896
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,490
Yeah.

897
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,510
Oh!

898
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,070
Oh, my God, that's creepy!

899
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:26,830
That smile!

900
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,770
That smile!

901
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,110
She's a good girl.

902
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,430
Oh, hey, oh!

903
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,630
That smile, bro!

904
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:52,110
She was enjoying herself so much it was positively infectious.

905
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:57,190
Just watching her work put this car lover in a good mood.

906
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,670
Oh, car lover.

907
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,450
Next time, come over to say hello instead of staring at me.

908
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,550
No, no, Ed!

909
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,250
No!

910
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:08,130
You need a supervisor there if he's there alone with you.

911
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,770
You cannot be alone with this man!

912
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,250
Did you not see how he fucking smiled at you?

913
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,350
Cars are awesome.

914
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,690
Sure wish I had my own.

915
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,170
Ooh.

916
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,650
Stranger danger.

917
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,450
Stranger...

918
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,410
Oh, my God, what the fuck is wrong with that?

919
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,210
Then you should really head to the junk pit.

920
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,530
He needs a chaperone.

921
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,110
You need a body guide.

922
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,050
Junk pit?

923
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,410
Turn right at the fork leading to the Leesob Junkers Market.

924
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,830
There's a pit where junkers toss all the stuff in it.

925
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,090
He just really, really loves cars.

926
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,550
You don't understand.

927
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,570
You're saying I could find a car there?

928
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,990
I could get a car?

929
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,370
Maybe not a whole car, but you might find a freight.

930
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,910
You do not go to that mad junk pit.

931
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,570
I'll be sure to bring mine.

932
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,310
Okay, car park.

933
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,910
Oh, these are all like side quests.

934
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,390
I can't wait to not...

935
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:09,610
Oh!

936
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,510
Oh!

937
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,310
Meowjin Boo!

938
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,410
Hey, nice to see you again.

939
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,050
Meowjin Boo!

940
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,530
Is it just my imagination or has the town gotten more lively?

941
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,190
Oh, yeah.

942
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,650
I found something cool.

943
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,490
Oh, my God.

944
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,950
Thank you for the free stuff, Meowjin Boo.

945
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,910
Okay, do I have anything?

946
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,730
I need like two ancient coins?

947
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,310
Bring me any rare items you find.

948
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,390
Fucking greedy as hell.

949
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,750
What are you going to do with the ancient coin?

950
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,530
You want me to fucking...

951
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,710
You want me to fucking like ruin more ancient ruins?

952
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:50,970
That's why it's called ruin.

953
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,950
Sorry, I'm going to discover...

954
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,750
I'm here to discover more national treasures.

955
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:58,850
I...

956
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,510
I'd heard demons were attacking passersby.

957
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,590
Stealing water and such...

958
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,090
Water?

959
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,410
But there's so much water behind you.

960
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,710
Wait, I thought you guys were attacked like no food and water.

961
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,150
What is that behind you?

962
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:14,870
I...

963
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:15,830
I...

964
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,810
I just got scared.

965
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,810
Well, there's some truth to that.

966
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,190
But it sounds like...

967
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,430
I'm just bringing you back to the museum.

968
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:23,870
You're right.

969
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:24,310
... rather inflated.

970
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,090
Attacking passersby?

971
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,950
We only take what we need from the royal army.

972
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,550
Exactly!

973
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,090
From the army?

974
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,310
You go up against armed soldiers?

975
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,710
Yeah, because apparently the army is more evil than fucking Satan himself.

976
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,530
You must be really strong then.

977
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:40,570
Sure am.

978
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,090
And I'm only nine.

979
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:46,710
No wonder you can travel the dangerous sand land unscathed.

980
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,650
That's bleach.

981
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,590
What the fuck?

982
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,990
I guess you're too strong to find it dangerous.

983
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,030
But to us humans...

984
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,830
stepping outside town isn't something you do lightly.

985
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,010
Just traveling across the very desert is good enough.

986
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,890
Those weak flesh bodies.

987
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,490
But with the risk of bandit and raptor attacks as well...

988
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,510
we're risking our lives every time we go to another town.

989
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:18,730
Hmm.

990
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,690
That bad?

991
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,270
It is.

992
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,070
I can't travel alone either.

993
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,230
Yeah, I can tell why.

994
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,010
Even seasoned peddlers have to go.

995
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,650
You're basically let a little boy do all the fighting for you.

996
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,670
I can see why you can't travel alone.

997
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:33,570
And you're a goner.

998
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,690
So you need luck just to reach your destination.

999
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,190
Wait, is this an escort mission?

1000
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,230
I guess that means I was lucky to meet you guys.

1001
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,870
Talking about all this has got me feeling a bit uneasy.

1002
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,570
She looks like Chi Chi.

1003
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,090
But with brown hair.

1004
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:56,630
Well, I ordered some new wares from a merchant.

1005
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,710
Oh my god.

1006
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:58,670
Have you guys seen like...

1007
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,990
Pecora's been like doing like the Dragon Ball Z streams and stuff.

1008
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,210
And like I...

1009
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,250
She's never fucking watched or played any Dragon Ball Z...

1010
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,530
Like Dragon Ball games.

1011
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,470
And it's actually...

1012
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,170
Or read any Dragon Ball before.

1013
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:17,530
So she like basically went in with zero knowledge of Dragon Ball.

1014
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,230
And I was like, how?

1015
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,510
Like I can see if you're like overseas.

1016
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,050
But she lives in Japan.

1017
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:25,530
How...

1018
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,990
That's just insane.

1019
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,850
That is just...

1020
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,530
I was like, that's actually crazy.

1021
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:40,830
Like growing up in Japan and never reading, watching or playing any Dragon Ball game.

1022
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:41,470
That's...

1023
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,510
I just like...

1024
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,150
That blew my fucking mind when I heard.

1025
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,490
He's always had incredible luck.

1026
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,370
So I didn't think much of it.

1027
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,290
But...

1028
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,230
What if he's in trouble?

1029
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,830
So it's actually like she actually goes in with zero knowledge.

1030
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:06,330
And like reacting to it live for like first time seeing all these things.

1031
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,790
So like a lot of drag...

1032
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:13,870
Obviously like, you know, Dragon Ball is like a huge like cultural phenomenon like overseas and also domestically.

1033
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:21,550
And so like people like are watching it because it's like you can see an actual first time live reaction of somebody.

1034
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,030
Like never...

1035
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,750
Who's never had any background information about Dragon Ball.

1036
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,190
Like experiencing it for the first time.

1037
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,790
So they're basically like reliving their life.

1038
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,790
Like they're watching it so they can like...

1039
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,270
What's the word called?

1040
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,510
It's like Outer Wilds.

1041
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:40,510
Like basically reliving the experience through her type deal.

1042
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:42,050
Um...

1043
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:43,410
Beelzebub.

1044
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,990
If you ever see that merchant in trouble during your travels...

1045
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,970
Could you please help him out?

1046
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,410
Maybe if I'm in the mood.

1047
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,170
Thank you.

1048
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,610
I'm counting on you.

1049
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:04,670
And they're living vicariously through her to re-experience Dragon Ball Z for like as if it's like the first time again.

1050
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:06,770
Which is very rare.

1051
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:07,570
It's actually...

1052
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:14,130
Like it actually blew my fucking mind that she never had any like Dragon Ball knowledge before playing the game.

1053
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,290
Because she doesn't know anything that's going on and she's like what?

1054
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,650
Like what the fuck?

1055
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,620
Alright.

1056
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,460
It's time to go.

1057
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,450
How far did I know the Dragon Ball arc?

1058
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:36,190
Pretty far.

1059
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:37,890
I've actually...

1060
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:38,710
Like I watched...

1061
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,130
I watched Dragon Ball from like...

1062
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,010
Like the...

1063
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,390
When he was a little kid.

1064
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:43,450
To...

1065
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,250
Uh...

1066
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,470
To like...

1067
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,030
I...

1068
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:46,970
Was it GT?

1069
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:48,030
I watched...

1070
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:48,490
I didn't...

1071
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,130
I didn't watch all of GT because it's GT.

1072
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,890
I don't know much about...

1073
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,750
I don't know much about like the...

1074
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,950
The world saga.

1075
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,230
Like the world tournament.

1076
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,070
Not that the world tournament...

1077
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,170
Who the fuck is this guy?

1078
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,570
Oh it's...

1079
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:07,470
Do I save him?

1080
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,650
Oh I guess I'll save him.

1081
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,450
No!

1082
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,410
My fucking taxi!

1083
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:14,430
No!

1084
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,750
What if I intimidate him?

1085
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,470
Okay hello.

1086
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,270
Hello.

1087
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,290
Intimidate.

1088
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:21,650
Intimidate.

1089
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:22,970
Intimidate.

1090
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:24,430
Intimidate.

1091
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:24,970
No!

1092
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,350
Stop right away!

1093
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:28,030
No!

1094
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,870
I can't believe it!

1095
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:35,610
My daddo!

1096
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,510
He ran away!

1097
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:39,950
My car ran away!

1098
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:43,950
Give me the fucking money.

1099
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,930
Why do you have your eyes closed?

1100
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:49,710
Well...

1101
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:50,610
Because...

1102
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:50,870
What was it?

1103
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,930
The universe tournament.

1104
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,430
The one where like...

1105
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,250
Like the universe tournament.

1106
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,050
Not the world tournament.

1107
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:56,330
Yeah.

1108
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,330
I stopped...

1109
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,710
I haven't watched...

1110
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,390
Dragon Ball Super?

1111
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:02,530
Is it...

1112
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:02,950
Is it Super?

1113
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,050
The one with like...

1114
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,010
That was like the sequel to Dragon Ball Z?

1115
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,610
Because like we don't...

1116
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,750
We don't talk about TT.

1117
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,150
Sharko!

1118
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,030
That's like living in America Canada.

1119
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,250
I'm never playing Halo.

1120
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,010
Oh wait that's me!

1121
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,150
I never played Halo!

1122
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,010
The multiverse tournament.

1123
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:20,490
Yeah!

1124
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:21,270
Yeah!

1125
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:24,290
Like the only thing I know about Super is the...

1126
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,390
The cat guy.

1127
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,310
The cat guy.

1128
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,070
And then like the...

1129
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,530
The tournament of power.

1130
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,550
And I know about the tournament of power arc.

1131
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,670
Because I watched a little bit of it.

1132
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,870
Because I thought it was super interesting.

1133
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:36,630
And uh...

1134
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:40,270
And I watched like a little bit of the tournament of power arc.

1135
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,750
And like read the Wikipedia.

1136
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,570
Of like everything about the tournament of power.

1137
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,590
Because I thought it was like a super interesting arc.

1138
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,830
And then that's the only thing I know about Dragon Ball Super.

1139
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,060
If it's not one thing it's another.

1140
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:02,880
Another for this guy.

1141
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,480
And here I thought that with the raptors gone...

1142
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,480
I'd finally get to make my deliveries to Spino.

1143
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,380
Oh you're a delivery man?

1144
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,060
Spino?

1145
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,200
Wait are you a peddler?

1146
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,220
Yeah what are you?

1147
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,760
Indeed I am.

1148
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,460
Then hurry before you get attacked again.

1149
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,560
Aedes is waiting.

1150
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,600
Oh you know Aedes?

1151
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,280
Yeah I know Aedes.

1152
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,120
Are you the one who drove the...

1153
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,640
Yeah that's me.

1154
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,620
They were snapping at my heels so I sent them flying.

1155
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,560
That's all.

1156
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,260
Even so.

1157
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,060
It doesn't change the fact that you saved me.

1158
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,320
Here.

1159
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,240
Take this as thanks.

1160
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,500
I don't want it.

1161
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:48,920
No!

1162
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,700

1163
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,660

1164
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,200
If I don't thank you properly...

1165
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,400
What the fuck do you mean I want it?

1166
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,200
Instead of don't want your thanks.

1167
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,660
Don't force it on me.

1168
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,660
Well then I'll follow your advice and hurry on to Spino.

1169
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,500
Bye.

1170
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,600
Bye.

1171
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,980
Give me a break.

1172
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,480
What's wrong with that guy?

1173
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,500
What the fuck he gave you something and you're like what the fuck is wrong with him?

1174
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,460
He gave me free shit.

1175
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,620
Like what's wrong with you?

1176
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,880
Like Payton thank you for the super chat.

1177

Thank you thank you.

1178
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,260
From Fallout to Dragon Ball.

1179
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,980
How the Doki supremacy continues.

1180
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,420
Thank you for the super chat.

1181
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,120
Thank you thank you.

1182

1183
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,420
God damn it Beezlebub.

1184
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,920
We love free stuff.

1185
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,180
I got like one experience for that.

1186
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,200
That's actually crazy.

1187
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,900
Guys I have to go back for my car.

1188
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,180
Actually no I don't need it.

1189
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,260
Let's try the jumper bot.

1190
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,520
Let's see how that's like.

1191
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,220
Where would the others get on?

1192
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,400
Okay.

1193
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,500
All pilot move.

1194
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,580
Leave vehicle.

1195
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,440
Boost.

1196
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,260
X to stomp.

1197
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,440
Shoot.

1198
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,260
Hold to aim.

1199
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,220
Reload.

1200
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,000
Okay I'm gonna forget like majority of this.

1201
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,900
So yell at me if I don't remember.

1202
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,700
Wait where are the others?

1203
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,940
Do they just not exist?

1204
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,980
Oh my god look at me go.

1205
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,040
I wish I have my Raptor.

1206
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,460
Okay we gotta go.

1207
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,100
East Valley.

1208
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,620
Water supply point.

1209
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,300
Gifted flowers.

1210
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,420
Do I care enough about the people?

1211
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,060
Okay wait.

1212
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,180
This is a junk pit.

1213
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,920
The diamonds boss.

1214
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,040
Alright we gotta run.

1215
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,140
Alright.

1216
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,020
We're just gonna run.

1217
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,680
Oh my god we're going 49 kilometers.

1218
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,900
Kilometers per hour.

1219
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,300
What's that supposed to mean?

1220
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,280
What the fuck does that mean?

1221
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,000
Okay I'm gonna.

1222
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,680
What does this look like?

1223
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,580
Okay that's what that does.

1224
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,840
Okay and then...

1225
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,760
The stomp move and alright reload.

1226
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,760
Alright we got this.

1227
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,980
Oh my god look at all these.

1228
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,320
Oh my god, there's so many babies!

1229
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:08,920
Oh my god, it's so easy to kill them!

1230
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,200
Look at all these children!

1231
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,760
Wait, they have to run behind me?

1232
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,120
Okay, that's pretty funny.

1233
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,520
Until there's only one left.

1234
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,400
I like how the NPCs are just following behind me.

1235
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,560
Alright, nice.

1236
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,280
It's okay, there's still one more left.

1237
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,860
What the fuck?!

1238
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,600
The pterodactyls hate me as well?!

1239
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,960
But why?!

1240
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,640
I'm a good person!

1241
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,420
What did I do?!

1242
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,480
I basically...

1243
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,480
Oh, I killed like...

1244
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,520
Because they need the babies to eat.

1245
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,160
Alright, let's make sure we kill these people.

1246
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:02,960
Sorry, not kill.

1247
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,560
Just injured them a little bit.

1248
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,300
Because we don't kill, guys!

1249
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:07,720
Remember!

1250
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:16,220
Guys, I don't know if you guys remember this, but we don't kill in this universe because killing is a line we will never cross.

1251
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,660
Let's see, we gotta get rid of him...

1252
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,080
and him.

1253
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,520
Alright, we did it.

1254
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,420
Oh my god!

1255
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,840
Simulate time!

1256
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,920
This is mine now.

1257
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,760
Oh shit.

1258
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,580
We gotta shoot some birds down.

1259
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,360
There can only be one bird in the sky.

1260
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,780
Don't kill a child, murder it, pack it...

1261
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,980
Wait, he gets his own car?!

1262
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,680
Okay, I like how he follows me with his car.

1263
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,740
Okay, that's nice.

1264
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,980
That's pretty good.

1265
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,320
I like that, actually.

1266
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,580
He just follows me in his own car.

1267
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,980
No one's safe from me.

1268
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,800
Baby is easier to kill.

1269
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,420
It's just stomping on some bugs, guys.

1270
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,380
No big deal.

1271
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,800
Did I kill him?

1272
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,400
Wait, no I didn't!

1273
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,460
No, I did!

1274
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,740
Alright, don't worry.

1275
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,800
Don't worry.

1276
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,400
You're gonna be a widow now.

1277
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,320
Actually, no.

1278
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,200
Let's just have the kids be orphans.

1279
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,260
Alright.

1280
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,180
Nice.

1281
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,280
The kids have more loot.

1282
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,680
No, the moms have more loot.

1283
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,700
So it makes more sense.

1284
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,200
To just kill the mom.

1285
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,020
The kids don't give as much.

1286
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:40,400
See?

1287
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,320
Look, the mom gave me like...

1288
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,280
Venom and the exoskeleton.

1289
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,840
Alright, we're gonna loot this.

1290
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,220
Loot.

1291
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:49,660
Loot.

1292
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,860
I'm just doing my part.

1293
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:53,880
Exactly!

1294
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,040
I'm doing my part.

1295
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:56,800
We're playing hell...

1296
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,900
Anime Helldivers 2.

1297
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,820
Jacob, welcome to the tomato farm.

1298
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,500
Welcome, welcome.

1299
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,860
This game has everything.

1300
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,160
Anime Mad Max.

1301
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,900
Anime Helldivers.

1302
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,080
Anime...

1303
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,440
Wow.

1304
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,960
Their defenses are much stronger than I expected.

1305
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:19,500
Anime Mad Max.

1306
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,820
Guma, welcome to the tomato farm.

1307
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,480
Welcome, welcome.

1308
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,880
I like that you guys joined the tomato farm the moment I started killing kids.

1309
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,520
Like, I don't know what that says about you as well.

1310
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,720
Like, I don't know what that says about you as well.

1311
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,180
It's practically a fortress.

1312
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,280
There's no breaking through that.

1313
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,060
There's no breaking through that.

1314
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,820
As expected, we'll have to take a detour via East Valley.

1315
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,060
We'll have to take a detour via East Valley.

1316
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,020
Hmm.

1317
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,420
What is this?

1318
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:49,530
What's this?

1319
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:52,710
Whoa!

1320
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,210
Teria, Shiva!

1321
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,030
Wowza!

1322
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,050
That's my...

1323
00:57:58,830 --> 00:57:59,910
lucky charm.

1324
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,030
Whoa, yeah?

1325
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,410
How lucky.

1326
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:05,850
Wait a minute.

1327
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,170
Wait a second.

1328
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,070
Wait a minute.

1329
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,990
What do you do in this tank?

1330
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,590
What did you do in this tank?

1331
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:18,970
What did you do in this tank?

1332
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,910
I used to be a famous movie star.

1333
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:22,430
Sexy Terrier, right?

1334
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,690
Sexy Terrier.

1335
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:29,730
You might act like a stick in the mud, but looks like you're a dirty old man on the inside.

1336
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,070
But looks like you're a dirty old man on the inside.

1337
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,590
Shut up and sit down.

1338
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:34,830
We're moving out.

1339
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,910
Yeah, he's a dirty old man.

1340
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,570
No, I can't say it.

1341
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,350
I can't say it.

1342
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,510
Planning to face the army, old man?

1343
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,190
Is that what the lucky charm's for?

1344
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:49,830
What?

1345
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:53,650
But you said we weren't going to fight the royal army.

1346
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,290
But you said we weren't going to fight the royal army.

1347
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:57,730
But the old man's obviously gotta pay the royals back.

1348
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,490
For what they pulled on him.

1349
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,330
Hold on.

1350
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,190
Please tell me you're joking.

1351
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,070
That was 30 years ago.

1352
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:08,670
It's your fault, thief.

1353
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,390
Wait, why was it his fault?

1354
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:12,110
What did he do?

1355
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:14,870
You're the one who blabbed all those secrets to him like a total know-it-all.

1356
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:15,790
Wait, what?

1357
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,170
How did you shift the blame?

1358
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:21,230
He's literally just like the fucking third wheel.

1359
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:22,390
He's literally just like the fucking third wheel.

1360
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:22,450
He's literally just like the fucking third wheel.

1361
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:27,330
But if the royal army gets in my way, I'll gladly take them on.

1362
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,830
I'd give my left arm for a chance at Supreme Commander Zeyu.

1363
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:33,750
Poor man.

1364
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,810
He gets like fucking...

1365
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:37,450
What?

1366
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:39,730
Who the fuck is this guy?

1367
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,510
He's just catching some strays.

1368
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,550
He's just catching some strays.

1369
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,090
Who's this guy?

1370
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,330
Who's this guy?

1371
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:50,130
Who's this guy?

1372
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:51,610
Who's this guy?

1373
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:52,690
Papa!

1374
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:55,310
Oh my god, Papa!

1375
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,010
That shit...

1376
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:00,430
Bro, okay.

1377
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,730
If he has a bod like that...

1378
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:06,250
Yeah, I'm not surprised he's fucking not wearing anything.

1379
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:07,610
Yeah, I'm not surprised he's fucking not wearing anything.

1380
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,610
Bro, he's gotta flex it, man.

1381
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:10,050
Bro, he's gotta flex it, man.

1382
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,870
If he hasn't, he's gotta show it.

1383
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,970
How the fuck do I get there?

1384
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:17,910
It's like here.

1385
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,210
There's no fall damage anyway.

1386
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:24,310
There's no fall damage anyway.

1387
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:25,530
Oh my god!

1388
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,510
Guys!

1389
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,150
It'll be okay.

1390
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:31,270
It's just a flesh wound.

1391
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,050
See it?

1392
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,490
Nothing bad happened.

1393
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,830
Guys, nothing bad happened.

1394
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,210
Oh my god!

1395
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:43,550
You mean I wasn't supposed to fall down?

1396
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:45,670
No!

1397
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,790
I fell down for no reason?

1398
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:53,950
Oh...

1399
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,650
That seems like something I do.

1400
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,070
There's... that's...

1401
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,670
That's something I do.

1402
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,590
Okay, wait.

1403
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:09,950
Maybe I can salvage this guy's...

1404
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:12,930
Guys, I can salvage this guy's...

1405
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,090
It's parkour time.

1406
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,150
It's okay.

1407
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,270
It's okay, guys.

1408
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,450
There has to be a way to cheese this.

1409
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,970
Oh my god, I knew it.

1410
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:31,330
I knew it.

1411
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,230
If there's a way...

1412
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,770
I will Skyrim this shit if I have to.

1413
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,190
I knew they would...

1414
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:41,910
Build a Skyrim for me.

1415
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,890
I knew it.

1416
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,470
It's like I didn't fuck up.

1417
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,190
We actually did it!

1418
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:48,870
We actually did it!

1419
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:50,410
Wooo!

1420
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:51,490
Wooo!

1421
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,870
I am determined.

1422
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,810
Where's a horse when you need one?

1423
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:02,350
If only you had a jump pot If only you had a jump pot that could jump.

1424
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:04,430
No!

1425
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,350
No!

1426
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,570
Okay, let's get the jump pot out.

1427
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:09,810
Okay, let's get the jump pot out.

1428
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:10,550
Alright.

1429
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,270
Now we need the jump pot.

1430
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,550
There is a jump that I cannot make.

1431
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:20,470
No!

1432
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:21,850
Okay.

1433
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,010
Guys, there's a delay when it comes to jumping.

1434
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:28,290
Did you guys know that?

1435
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,590
What the fuck am I...

1436
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:32,830
Okay.

1437
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,650
There's like a delay you don't understand.

1438
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:39,190
There's like a delay you don't understand.

1439
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,970
Are you fucking...

1440
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:43,190
I...

1441
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,340
Bro!

1442
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,280
No!

1443
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,400
Game over!

1444
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:58,750
Okay.

1445
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,110
Guys!

1446
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,830
There's a delay!

1447
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,910
Like what the fuck!

1448
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:05,610
Okay.

1449
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,110
We're gonna try again.

1450
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,730
There's a delay in jumping!

1451
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:14,210
I swear to God!

1452
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,030
I swear to God!

1453
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:19,290
Okay.

1454
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:21,990
Like I can't stop the delay!

1455
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,630
Like I can't stop the delay!

1456
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:25,330
What?

1457
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,090
This is bullshit.

1458
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:30,230
This is actually bullshit.

1459
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:31,270
Okay.

1460
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,210
Okay, here we go.

1461
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,170
Oh my God, I did it.

1462
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:38,510
I fucking did it.

1463
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,170
Guys, I beat hard mode.

1464
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,370
Guys, this is the hardest part of the game.

1465
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,270
This is... This is the hardest part of the game.

1466
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:47,470
This is the hardest part of the video game chat.

1467
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,050
You don't understand.

1468
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:52,410
You don't understand how difficult that was for me.

1469
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,350
We could reach it.

1470
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,110
Okay.

1471
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,610
Ooh, loot!

1472
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:57,710
Nice.

1473
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:02,130
Oh, thank God I have a robot that can jump.

1474
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:02,450
Oh, thank God I have a robot that can jump.

1475
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,650
Oh, now it fucking responds!

1476
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,350
This is bullshit.

1477
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,730
This is actually bullshit.

1478
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,350
This is a cover up from the government.

1479
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:15,310
The government doesn't want people to know how good I am at video games.

1480
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:17,810
So they purposely added nurse for me.

1481
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,550
Like...

1482
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,950
It's not a conspiracy if it's true.

1483
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,390
The government purposely added lag.

1484
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,490
So I wouldn't...

1485
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,430
So I wouldn't hit those jumps.

1486
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:36,290
They added latency on my jumps.

1487
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,690
They added latency on my jumps.

1488
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,430
I don't want my true power to show up.

1489
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,690
I swear to the peeps, she's catching on.

1490
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,050
Quick, somebody!

1491
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,770
How's the volume so far?

1492
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,350
Is it like loud enough?

1493
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:58,270
Or too loud?

1494
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,050
I just wanna be sure.

1495
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,230
Bro, I'm so mad.

1496
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:03,590
I'm gonna start killing the wildlife.

1497
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,550
It's the leader of the raptors.

1498
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:10,610
The leader?

1499
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:11,430
This guy?

1500
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,110
Bro, I can just shoot the raptors.

1501
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,090
We have to be careful though.

1502
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,390
Like, look, I can just do this.

1503
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:18,770
You...

1504
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:19,930
Oh shit!

1505
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,410
See, look at that.

1506
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,250
I can just do this.

1507
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:22,750
Wait!

1508
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:25,250
Wait, he can't fucking leave!

1509
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,270
Wait, he's stuck!

1510
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,670
Oh, he's not stuck, guys!

1511
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:30,390
He's not stuck!

1512
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,170
Oh, what the fuck!

1513
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:36,090
Okay.

1514
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:36,870
Okay, it's okay.

1515
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,370
There's no way he's gonna kill me.

1516
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:41,410
Wait, he has to!

1517
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:41,910
He has fire?

1518
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:43,530
I could jump.

1519
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,750
I could jump from that.

1520
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:45,990
What?!

1521
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:49,910
Okay, one more hit.

1522
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:51,210
One more hit.

1523
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:52,090
Nice, we did it.

1524
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:53,870
Let's see.

1525
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,510
Oh, it just gives me like five raptor skills.

1526
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,210
The air shot.

1527
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:02,610
They want the true power of the silver unleashed upon them.

1528
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:04,170
Breeze, thank you for the super chat.

1529
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:04,590
Thank you.

1530
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,550
They're hiding my true power.

1531
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:08,450
My power level.

1532
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:09,130
Chat.

1533
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:11,410
It's the government.

1534
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:15,050
That is a conspiracy I'm willing to get behind in.

1535
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:16,970
Wait.

1536
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:17,690
Okay, there we go.

1537
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,430
Alright, now I don't have any repair kits.

1538
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:20,310
This is gonna be a little bad.

1539
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:22,070
Am I going the right way?

1540
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:24,490
It's like here, right?

1541
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:25,750
The East Valley?

1542
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,790
Yeah, alright.

1543
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:27,310
It's here.

1544
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:32,430
We're gonna get rid of the scorpions.

1545
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:34,490
Alright, we're gonna make more orphans.

1546
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:40,110
Eventually, those orphans are gonna find the moms that I spared.

1547
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:41,750
And then I'm gonna...

1548
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,130
And then they're gonna thank me.

1549
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:46,210
Alright, and then I'm gonna kill the kids here.

1550
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:50,630
So then the mom can adopt the orphans that I made behind me.

1551
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:51,670
And then there!

1552
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:53,030
I solved the orphan problem.

1553
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:58,630
And then they're gonna like love each other from the trauma they built together.

1554
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:04,740
What's this?

1555
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,360
They're gonna thank me for...

1556
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,240
Thank me for saving them.

1557
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,060
Wait, their family bond is gonna be stronger than blood.

1558
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,500
Because I basically...

1559
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,660
Oh, the sandfall.

1560
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,140
I did a risky mission.

1561
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,020
Give me the money.

1562
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,240
Thank you.

1563
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,340
I only do this for the money.

1564
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,820
Wait, is that bad guy?

1565
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,240
Oh, that's so pretty.

1566
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:41,600
That's fu- It's not fucked up!

1567
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:42,800
Because...

1568
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,300
You don't have more...

1569
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,080
It's only fucked up because you still have empathy.

1570
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,360
Okay, wait.

1571
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,740
Can I have him like shoot things for me?

1572
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,510
It's called practicality.

1573
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:10,750
Nice, let me...

1574
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:14,750
So it's extra fucked up.

1575
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,430
Okay, let's grab this.

1576
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:19,290
I want the gems.

1577
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:23,330
I like how I can farm these things without having to get off the...

1578
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:24,750
get off the jumper bot.

1579
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:26,570
Is there anything above me?

1580
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,430
I feel like there's something above me.

1581
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:32,010
That's even more fucked up.

1582
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,030
Oh my god.

1583
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:35,130
You sound like somebody that has moros.

1584
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:38,770
Who still has that?

1585
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,150
What's over here?

1586
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,050
Is this like...

1587
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,230
a secret area?

1588
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,170
No, I don't know if I should go this way.

1589
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:54,230
I'm not going this way.

1590
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,170
They're children?

1591
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:06,810
I thought moros got patched.

1592
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,930
Oh my god, moros in 2024?

1593
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:10,790
Morality?

1594
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,470
This is why we got rid of the morality system.

1595
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:19,250
It's actually true.

1596
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,630
I don't know if you guys noticed this.

1597
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:32,150
But like, I feel like more and more recent games, like games that used to have a morality system, they got rid of the morality system because they realized gamers don't care about...

1598
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,430
Have you guys noticed that?

1599
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:43,070
Like some games that used to have like morality system, they like patched it.

1600
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,450
They got rid of it.

1601
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:44,070
They got rid of it.

1602
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:46,590
We go to any lengths.

1603
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:50,710
We definitely need like repair kit, guys.

1604
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,190
Okay, repair kit.

1605
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:53,810
Oh wait, no.

1606
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:54,590
I shouldn't sell it.

1607
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,830
I want to buy a repair kit.

1608
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:57,790
Okay, I'll buy two.

1609
01:09:58,510 --> 01:09:59,490
We might as well.

1610
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:01,290
We have a lot of money, right?

1611
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,310
Yeah, we have a lot.

1612
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:05,870
Yeah, undertale.

1613
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:06,730
Yeah, but do you remember...

1614
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:08,490
Do you know how old undertale is?

1615
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,350
A lot of like more...

1616
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,470
recent AAA...

1617
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:19,730
Well, I was gonna say AAA games, but a lot of like more recent video games have gotten rid of it.

1618
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,630
GTA, who needs more?

1619
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,510
Guys, I'm still okay.

1620
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:38,330
Okay.

1621
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:43,650
Wee.

1622
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,310
How do I...

1623
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:47,450
How do I miss that jump?

1624
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,730
Oh my god, did my NPC die with me?

1625
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:53,810
I hate this.

1626
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:55,210
I actually hate this.

1627
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,910
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1628
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:02,510
No!

1629
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,730
This fucking sucks.

1630
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:06,530
Okay.

1631
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:09,290
Okay.

1632
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:12,210
I blame the government.

1633
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:14,610
The government is adding latency to my game.

1634
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:17,370
I swear to God!

1635
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:18,950
It's not me!

1636
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:23,650
There's a lag!

1637
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,710
I swear!

1638
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:26,490
There's like lag!

1639
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:41,010
I doubt it'll be quite that simple.

1640
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:43,650
Even so, it's a big step forward.

1641
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:47,070
Well, what are we waiting for?

1642
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:48,350
Let's get up there!

1643
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:53,380
Okay, we gotta jump.

1644
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,940
Okay, we also gotta heal.

1645
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,700
Uh, we did it!

1646
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,320
We healed!

1647
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,840
Alright, here we go!

1648
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,720
How do we get up there?

1649
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:04,300
Do we jump?

1650
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,260
Falling from here would barely even tickle.

1651
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,220
Okay, we got this.

1652
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:09,920
Look at that!

1653
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,100
I figured it out!

1654
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:16,780
See, look at- this is what my true power is like without the government trying to nerf me.

1655
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,320
Look!

1656
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:23,220
Oh, and then suddenly there's no latency between my jumps?

1657
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,480
Like, what?

1658
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:25,860
Coincidence?

1659
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,860
I think not.

1660
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,760
Don't fall out of the Doki platforms.

1661
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,180
Come on, thief!

1662
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,220
Tired already?

1663
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,620
You need to get off your butt more than once every hundred years.

1664
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,940
Easy for you to say from a jump bu- huh?

1665
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,140
Huh?

1666
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,620
Prince!

1667
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:49,660
What?

1668
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:50,900
Huh?

1669
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:53,760
Whoa!

1670
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,920
Shoot the rock!

1671
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,300
Oh, jump?

1672
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:02,920
Close!

1673
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,420
Look, I just shot the rock.

1674
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,500
It's a rock.

1675
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,340
Papa!

1676
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:07,560
Oh my-

1677
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,120
Don't worry!

1678
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,480
Just keep going!

1679
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:21,020
I'm sorry, like, I like how the guy on the far left just doesn't have a fucking nose.

1680
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,280
He just has two holes.

1681
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,240
Like, what?

1682
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:25,380
Huuuuuuuh.

1683
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:29,630
Pike!

1684
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:32,430
Sketch all their faces for me, would ya?

1685
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,430
Coming riiight up!

1686
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,660
The fuck is he- what?

1687
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,520
What is he doing?

1688
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,240
They have good team chemistry.

1689
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,760
What a team.

1690
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:57,030
Beelzebub!

1691
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:58,330
Wait, do they know who I am?

1692
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:59,150
Hey, man, that's your butt!

1693
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,320
Beelzebub!

1694
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:05,900
That's me!

1695
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,680
Why is the fiend- How does he know who I am?

1696
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:12,040
Then you're a human!

1697
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,520
What are we doing?

1698
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,420
Everyone just- Oh, I've beaten him up before.

1699
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,440
Don't be a coward!

1700
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:26,520
You know this guy waxes too, cause like there's literally no hair on his face.

1701
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,580
On any of them.

1702
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,880
My god.

1703
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:29,560
Swimmers!

1704
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,840
The biggest, baddest criminals in all of Sandland!

1705
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,780
He waxes all the hair off, except for the mustache.

1706
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,480
And be ready to run if it doesn't work!

1707
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,580
Okey dokey!

1708
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,100
Doki, please!

1709
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:46,160
Look!

1710
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,660
There's no hair anywhere!

1711
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:48,820
It's the swimmers!

1712
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:53,460
Hydrodynamic!

1713
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,520
The swimmers?

1714
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,500
As in the swimmers?

1715
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,600
The famous bandits?

1716
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,000
I should have known those crooks would play dirty!

1717
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,580
Giggles, thank you for the superchat!

1718
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:08,020
Your very first superchat too!

1719
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:08,980
Thank you, thank you!

1720
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,800
Yeah, I remember wishing you a happy birthday last time!

1721
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,640
Just wanted to say thank you for making my birthday so special last Thursday.

1722
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,180
Here's a little something to show my love and support.

1723
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:18,580
Mwah!

1724
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,960
I'm excited for everything you have in the future!

1725
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:20,340
Thank you!

1726
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,740
Thank you for the superchat!

1727
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:22,000
Thank you!

1728
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:24,780
The Jokebot's history is so much that a single boulder connects with it.

1729
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,080
Oh!

1730
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,140
Oh yeah, I remember asking how you guys think the sound was now.

1731
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,900
But then I didn't look at chat.

1732
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,200
Oh shit, it's 2D time!

1733
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,760
Is the sound okay?

1734
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,400
Wee-oo!

1735
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,300
I can speedrun this.

1736
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,540
Oh god, woah!

1737
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,440
Oh, I don't know...

1738
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:49,640
Oh!

1739
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:50,900
What the fuck?

1740
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:51,720
Where was the...

1741
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,520
Where was the fucking...

1742
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:54,340
Assist?

1743
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,520
Oh, you guys said it was good?

1744
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:58,840
Huh?

1745
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:01,940
It's Donkey Kong time.

1746
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,200
Time to beat him up.

1747
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,440
Shoot him!

1748
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,060
Oh yeah!

1749
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,160
Wait, you're right.

1750
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,640
It's because our bond grows stronger.

1751
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,480
Oh, I have to go this way.

1752
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,300
I have to go backwards.

1753
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,460
Guys, guys, guys!

1754
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,460
It's not a skill.

1755
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,840
I swear it's not a...

1756
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,900
Shoot it!

1757
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,180
Shoot it, old man!

1758
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,220
I feel like he's in the bathroom.

1759
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:44,400
Like...

1760
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:52,310
Oh my god, it sounds like they're in the fucking bathroom right now.

1761
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:53,810
It's throwing me off.

1762
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:56,850
It's actually throwing me off.

1763
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,570
No weak knees, boys!

1764
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:00,170
Let's go!

1765
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:03,830
I thought someone was in my house.

1766
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:07,850
It sounded like someone was in the bathroom.

1767
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:10,470
The public bathroom.

1768
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:10,530
The public bathroom.

1769
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:14,350
Guys, I haven't used my fists in so long.

1770
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,250
I've been using my...

1771
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:19,530
Holy shitty uppercut in me!

1772
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,370
Oh my god.

1773
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:22,490
Bro, I haven't...

1774
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:24,350
How do I dodge?

1775
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:25,470
Oh, it's this.

1776
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:25,890
Okay.

1777
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:28,610
Guys, I haven't used my fists in so long.

1778
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,230
I don't know what that is like.

1779
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:31,050
Using my hands?

1780
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:31,550
What's that?

1781
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:35,370
Don't back down now!

1782
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:38,810
What the fuck is using my hands like?

1783
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:39,150
It's dark!

1784
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:40,550
I made machines!

1785
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:45,790
The machines have been doing all my work for so long!

1786
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:47,650
What is this like?

1787
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:50,750
Wait, can I combo him?

1788
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:52,810
Can I combo him so he can't do anything?

1789
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:53,570
No, I can't.

1790
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:53,930
No!

1791
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:55,210
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1792
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:58,770
Wait, can I send in my...

1793
01:17:58,770 --> 01:17:59,850
God, okay, okay.

1794
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:00,290
Wait, wait, wait.

1795
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,970
I have special skills.

1796
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:03,850
Wait, give me a sec.

1797
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:05,230
I have... Rush!

1798
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:08,710
That's fucking right!

1799
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:15,870
I remember how to dodge, guys.

1800
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,030
Can't track him!

1801
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,590
Can't track him!

1802
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,270
Guys, I can't see him!

1803
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:22,490
Where is he?

1804
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:23,830
Is he in front of me?

1805
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,310
You despicable fiend!

1806
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,330
Attacking poor, defenseless humans!

1807
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:33,850
Cream on!

1808
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:36,450
You're the ones who started this fight!

1809
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:39,390
Oh yeah, I was like nut level.

1810
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,650
How would you like me to finish it?

1811
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:47,590
Guppy!

1812
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:49,210
Guppy?

1813
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:50,550
What are you calling Guppy?

1814
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:51,870
Oh shit, what about gun?

1815
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:53,630
That's not fair!

1816
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,860
Dang it!

1817
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,240
Wait, he just shot his leader?

1818
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,960
Oh, it was like a smoke screen.

1819
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,800
Oh, that's smart.

1820
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:11,220
I mean, they could have shot him, but like, I guess that works too.

1821
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,120
Hey!

1822
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,320
Alright,

1823
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,240
nice.

1824
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,660
I did it.

1825
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,360
I did it!

1826
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,320
Of course, I'm literally bulletproof.

1827
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:35,160
We've established this.

1828
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:39,820
Wait, that's me!

1829
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:40,240
That's me!

1830
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,040
Oh my god, he's an artist.

1831
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,300
He's so beautiful.

1832
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,880
But what would they need this sketch for?

1833
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:50,300
It's me!

1834
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,800
Hire me, I'm cheaper.

1835
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,500
Let me voice act in your game.

1836
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,020
I'm pretty sure I'll be cheaper.

1837
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,240
Because I'm not in.

1838
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,760
Oh no, that's so fucked up for me to say.

1839
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:13,740
Guys, this is a joke, but I was gonna say I'm not in the union, so I'm cheaper.

1840
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,640
But that's a joke, guys.

1841
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:20,980
I mean, I'm not in the union, but like, I wouldn't, you know, take a job for me.

1842
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:27,020
You've got a gap of a drawing, son.

1843
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,310
I feel like I've seen this guy somewhere before.

1844
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:37,070
Nah.

1845
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:38,750
Nah.

1846
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,570
Alright, shark.

1847
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:44,390
Jesus, Cap, shake my hand.

1848
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:46,550
Go sell this pic to the news office.

1849
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:49,870
Don't let him have it for any less than two million zeni.

1850
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:53,430
Milk, I'm dry.

1851
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:54,430
You hear?

1852
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:56,590
What the fuck is wrong with his nose?

1853
01:20:58,490 --> 01:20:59,950
He looks like...

1854
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:03,670
What the fuck?

1855
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:06,650
Holy shit, he doesn't need no nose.

1856
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:10,250
I can level up.

1857
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:13,310
Yay!

1858
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:15,590
Yeah, he looks like fucking Voldemort.

1859
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:23,870
Okay, I can level up.

1860
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:24,750
Alright, let's see.

1861
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:27,050
Uh, what do I want?

1862
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:34,590
Enhance power, boost, realize power, raises power, darkness, follows, boost powers, a bee attacks.

1863
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:37,050
Uh, boost...

1864
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:37,870
Okay, I want boost...

1865
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:38,470
Oh, I already did.

1866
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,450
I already have boost power of X.

1867
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:41,650
Uh...

1868
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:43,610
Maybe...

1869
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:44,590
Power of...

1870
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:45,130
Bee?

1871
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:48,170
Wait, did I learn this already?

1872
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:52,210
Let's see.

1873
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:53,170
Follow up...

1874
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,210
I guess we'll try this.

1875
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:56,170
And then...

1876
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:56,930
So we can get...

1877
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:58,350
Yeah, we can get the max HP.

1878
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,230
We want that.

1879
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:01,630
Alright, what do I want from him?

1880
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:03,870
Extraction, deploy...

1881
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:07,050
Disploy nearby his number of targets for spoils of war.

1882
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:08,950
Dropping more items.

1883
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:10,190
It's gifted with...

1884
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:11,290
Oh, I want more items.

1885
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:14,230
Okay, we're just gonna do a thief.

1886
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:16,010
I feel like the thief has better...

1887
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:18,250
You're not able to learn this skill.

1888
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,630
I feel like the thief has better, like, abilities.

1889
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:22,390
Passive wise.

1890
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,430
It's all about the items.

1891
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:26,350
Alright, let's go.

1892
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:29,970
Wait, is this death?

1893
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:34,870
Hey guys.

1894
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:37,250
So don't...

1895
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,310
So, uh...

1896
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,890
Welcome back to my playthrough.

1897
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:42,790
As you guys know, do not jump into the sand of death.

1898
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:43,550
Do not...

1899
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,910
Do not jump into the sand of death.

1900
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:55,620
Please,

1901
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,860
if I keep spamming...

1902
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,640
Guys, I feel like I should have been using this.

1903
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,700
I don't know.

1904
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:10,920
Guys.

1905
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:11,620
I don't know.

1906
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,400
That's quicksand.

1907
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,440
I don't know if you guys know this, but visually, that's quicksand.

1908
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:23,160
So that's why there's a bridge.

1909
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,480
Why did they build a bridge for sand?

1910
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,440
Are they stupid?

1911
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,520
Alright, let's see.

1912
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,980
I wanna grab...

1913
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,240
Oh, there's some materials down there.

1914
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,460
Alright, let's grab that real fast.

1915
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:44,700
Oh, there's some materials down there.

1916
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:45,700
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1917
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:46,580
Stealing time.

1918
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,640
It's not stealing because it's mine.

1919
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:50,840
I don't wanna get back up top.

1920
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,080
Oh.

1921
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,700
Oh, there's stairs here.

1922
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:54,020
Oh, there's stairs here.

1923
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:54,240
Oh, thank God.

1924
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:54,540
Okay.

1925
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,340
I was gonna say, did I fuck up?

1926
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:57,720
There's stairs here.

1927
01:23:59,120 --> 01:23:59,560
Okay.

1928
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,980
I'm gonna grab the jewels.

1929
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,000
The gems.

1930
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:05,980
Not the reload!

1931
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:10,500
Okay, reloading.

1932
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,020
Just give me infinite ammo.

1933
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:12,440
I need a reload.

1934
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,060
I need a reload.

1935
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,580
Red Dog, welcome to the tomato farm!

1936
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:17,260
Welcome, welcome!

1937
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:19,200
Okay,

1938
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:24,860
we're gonna make sure...

1939
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,840
We're gonna make sure we reload this too.

1940
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,200
Is this it?

1941
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,380
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

1942
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,220
Wait, how do I get there?

1943
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,300
Wait, what?

1944
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:40,540
What?

1945
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,360
How do I get there?

1946
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,980
I'm so... what?

1947
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,020
Is this... is there a way downstairs?

1948
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,380
Or is that dead end?

1949
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,400
Me!

1950
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,080
Thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

1951
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,000
Thank you, thank you!

1952
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:58,920
Oh!

1953
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,920
There was a hole.

1954
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,880
Down is up, guys.

1955
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,480
Oh shit!

1956
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,700
Sorry, I keep forgetting there's no fault.

1957
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:09,940
It's not this?

1958
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,840
Oh, do I have to use like the no- tank?

1959
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,640
Do I have to use the tank?

1960
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:19,260
Yes, I knew it.

1961
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:20,860
I fucking knew it.

1962
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:23,140
When there's a hole, there's a goal.

1963
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:40,270
I don't understand why don't- why don't just like...

1964
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:43,430
Cross out the 4 and like rewrite the number.

1965
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:49,590
This man, spotted inside the stolen tank, has been identified as Rau.

1966
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:50,810
He's alive!

1967
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:56,030
The 61 year old sheriff of a- Oh, he's 61?

1968
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,650
North of the Central District.

1969
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:00,610
Known as Up.

1970
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:12,550
However, when we ran the fingerprints of this Sheriff Rau through a centralized database, we discovered a far more shocking truth.

1971
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:15,990
Rau was a mere alias.

1972
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:30,850
Oh my god!

1973
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:31,490
That's you!

1974
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,890
You were the one that committed war crimes!

1975
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:41,090
Mercy?

1976
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:48,730
He literally killed off an entire alien race.

1977
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:52,670
General Shiva?!

1978
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:12,010
Oh my god, he's like Soldier 76.

1979
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:17,210
That's what the S is for.

1980
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:18,030
S for Shiva.

1981
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:19,330
Teria Shiva!

1982
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:21,390
That's his wife!

1983
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:28,890
You killed your wife?!

1984
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:32,790
Sexy Teria!

1985
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:35,710
I love how her name is Sexy Teria.

1986
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:59,710
I thought she was sexy too though.

1987
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:06,790
But if she was your wife, why a magazine clipping?

1988
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:08,670
Good man!

1989
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:13,650
Yeah, where's your personal photos of her?

1990
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:15,230
Oh!

1991
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:17,570
That's so sad!

1992
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:19,390
Bro!

1993
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:21,690
He's fucking...

1994
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:22,830
He puts...

1995
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:25,430
Bro!

1996
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,950
Bro!

1997
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:34,050
You can't have private alone happy time in the tank with a real photo of her.

1998
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:36,090
He has to fucking make do with a magazine.

1999
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:39,490
Hunter looked the maddest on us at least.

2000
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:40,770
Thank you for the super chat.

2001
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:41,250
Thank you.

2002
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:47,850
And while you're at it, tell the news office to double the reward for Shiva!

2003
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:55,330
And to make an announcement that anyone found sheltering him will be subdued!

2004
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:55,790
You're totally punished!

2005
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:58,490
Y-yes sir!

2006
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:02,270
Shiva...

2007
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:04,710
What are you up to?

2008
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:08,010
Ha!

2009
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:09,890
Can you explain this?

2010
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:12,950
You told me we'd gotten rid of Shiva!

2011
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:17,050
What the fuck is this baby?

2012
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:19,870
Thank you for the magenta soup!

2013
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:20,670
Thank you!

2014
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:21,230
Thank you!

2015
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,850
Random well-being checkup.

2016
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:23,710
How you been, Doki?

2017
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:24,930
Here's $50 dues!

2018
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:26,470
Get yourself some bread, mate!

2019
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,790
Maybe some bami too!

2020
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:28,890
Thank you for the magenta soup!

2021
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:29,410
Thank you!

2022
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:29,910
Thank you!

2023
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:30,990
I really appreciate it!

2024
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:32,130
I'm doing great!

2025
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:38,230
Playing a nice, amazing game from Toriyama and Bandai with my dragoons!

2026
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:40,170
Get your... voice down!

2027
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:42,350
He looks like a dumpling!

2028
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:43,590
He does!

2029
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,270
General Shiva?

2030
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:49,070
You mean... that?

2031
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:50,410
General Shiva?

2032
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:51,770
Wait, is that like his son or something?

2033
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:52,530
Do they have kids?

2034
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:56,230
Must have kids, right?

2035
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:57,250
Whoa!

2036
01:29:58,290 --> 01:30:00,450
Going to be fighting a legend?

2037
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:03,110
Oh my god, he's so happy about it!

2038
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:04,530
Oh my god, that gets him on...

2039
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:10,730
That makes him a bit way too excited!

2040
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,570
Reinforce our defenses at all locations!

2041
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:19,910
I like the tank on the far back, like the one with the dot eyes, and he's just like...

2042
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:22,330
He's just happy to be there!

2043
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:25,710
He doesn't even know what he's... actually, no, he doesn't even know what's going on!

2044
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,430
That tank behind him!

2045
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:33,990
Wait, let me see if there's a fast travel.

2046
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:34,910
That's the plan here.

2047
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:42,270
Yeah!

2048
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:49,950
Why?

2049
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:55,050
Oh my god, he's gonna spread some propaganda!

2050
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:02,810
GoldenHell, thank you for the super chat!

2051
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:03,610
Thank you, thank you!

2052
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:06,870
That is Kano after too many Mortal Kombat-backs.

2053
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:07,930
Thank you for the super chat!

2054
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:08,630
Thank you, thank you!

2055
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:09,010
Ginger!

2056
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:11,710
A grandpa phone diaper?

2057
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:12,010
No!

2058
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,850
Thank you for the super chat!

2059
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:15,010
Thank you, thank you!

2060
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,710
I told you, it's just like anime...

2061
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:21,070
Oh my god, those are some fucking tanks to simulate into!

2062
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:22,590
Don't worry.

2063
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:26,070
Wait, who's calling for help right now?

2064
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:31,970
I like how, like, there's an army here, and then there's like a guy that's being fucking...

2065
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:34,710
um... harassed by raptors.

2066
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:35,690
I'm just gonna run him over.

2067
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:39,070
It's not killing if I run him over!

2068
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:41,030
It's just an accident.

2069
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:47,930
Nice.

2070
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:49,410
Is there materials for me?

2071
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:51,890
Can I simulate into this?

2072
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:52,450
Oh, I can!

2073
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:54,910
Okay, let me kill these raptors real fast.

2074
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,270
For them.

2075
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:58,690
There we go.

2076
01:31:59,230 --> 01:31:59,570
Money!

2077
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:01,550
Oh, those kids are still alive.

2078
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:03,110
Phew!

2079
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:04,870
The kids were alive.

2080
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:07,370
It's just a prank!

2081
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:09,550
It's not murder!

2082
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:12,130
Why do people always say murder?

2083
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:21,770
I don't understand why people think it's murder when something just dies beside me.

2084
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:26,390
Like, what if they just had a heart attack and I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time?

2085
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:28,690
Sharko, thank you for the super chat.

2086
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:29,590
Thank you, thank you!

2087
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:32,430
I didn't know that iggoons were in this game.

2088
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:33,430
Thank you for the super chat.

2089
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:34,330
Thank you, thank you!

2090
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:40,050
It's only attempt... yeah, it was only an attempt because he survived.

2091
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:43,490
They died?

2092
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:44,230
Yeah, they died!

2093
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:45,950
They could have just had a heart attack!

2094
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:47,210
Bring them down one by one!

2095
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:47,990
You don't know that!

2096
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:50,170
Like...

2097
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:53,490
They could literally just have a heart attack!

2098
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:55,030
Looks like we're in for a fight.

2099
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:01,150
Okay, we gotta make sure we... Okay, first off, we have to make sure we hit those.

2100
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:04,170
Alright, nice, we got this tank.

2101
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:06,010
And then we gotta get that tank.

2102
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:09,130
Alright, they're only level 7.

2103
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:10,690
They're practically like babies.

2104
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,290
Okay, then we gotta...

2105
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:15,710
shoot the people.

2106
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:19,470
You know, my fucking controller aim ain't so bad.

2107
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,150
See, look!

2108
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:22,530
I did it!

2109
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:30,450
Everything I touch dies.

2110
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:31,210
It's not my fault.

2111
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:40,850
Doki's tank vs.

2112
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:41,510
coffee!

2113
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:45,530
New measurement.

2114
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:46,910
Who would win?

2115
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:49,810
Oh shit, loot!

2116
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:51,670
Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot!

2117
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:51,990
Yay!

2118
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:52,790
Wow!

2119
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:55,870
That's so much stuff for my new tank!

2120
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:57,850
Just run over it.

2121
01:33:57,910 --> 01:33:58,890
It doesn't matter to me.

2122
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:02,270
Yeah.

2123
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:04,070
Alright.

2124
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:08,030
I know, it's gonna be so fucking easy.

2125
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:12,070
Is this like...

2126
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:13,590
Oh my god!

2127
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:14,670
There's my taxi!

2128
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,590
Oh, it's just a...

2129
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:19,770
Oh, it's just a shop.

2130
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:23,070
Uh, do I have anything I need to buy?

2131
01:34:23,970 --> 01:34:26,110
I guess I'll buy another repair kit.

2132
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:28,910
I feel like that's the only thing I need.

2133
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:30,350
Yeah!

2134
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:32,010
Wait, there's a base there!

2135
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:33,810
I might as well!

2136
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:36,290
God, I wish I could steal that guy's dinosaur.

2137
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:38,190
It's so much faster than a tank.

2138
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,690
You cause the heart attacks when they gaze upon you, so...

2139
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:43,590
No, no, no!

2140
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:46,890
It's not my fault they died because I look so fucking...

2141
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:47,270
fine.

2142
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:48,030
Like, come on!

2143
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:53,630
Is that truly a crime?

2144
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:59,810
Because I look so beautiful that they died of heart attacks.

2145
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:01,130
Like, come on!

2146
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:03,110
It's cause they died of pure beauty.

2147
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:06,210
It's not a crime.

2148
01:35:06,210 --> 01:35:09,950
So, what are you gonna tell everyone?

2149
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:11,970
The truth.

2150
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:14,370
And what's been on my mind.

2151
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:16,410
What's on your mind, old man?

2152
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:20,050
I've got a bad... bad feeling about this.

2153
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:23,190
Beauty is a crime!

2154
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:29,730
We should keep our distance from the army base unless necessary.

2155
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:33,510
I bet they've got loads of loot in there!

2156
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:34,270
I know!

2157
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,150
They have so much loot!

2158
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:36,050
I can't argue with that.

2159
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:39,110
But somehow I doubt they'd take kindly to intruders.

2160
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,790
I'm gonna not listen to him.

2161
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:41,530
I'm gonna run up.

2162
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:42,130
Can't talk you out of it.

2163
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:45,250
Please, at least try to be sneaky about it.

2164
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:48,930
Sensei, thank you for the super chat!

2165
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,170
Thank you, thank you!

2166
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:53,030
Do I have to be sneaky?

2167
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:58,650
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear what he said.

2168
01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:00,770
I'm gonna go straight in.

2169
01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:05,130
When the terrain's to your disadvantage, keep moving until you're in a position.

2170
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:05,430
I'm gonna try to get to the right spot.

2171
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:08,490
No, I don't need that move.

2172
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:11,190
That won't stop me exactly!

2173
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:12,930
Look at that!

2174
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:17,670
If I run away, I can't level up, you idiot!

2175
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:20,910
God, old man, it's all about the levels!

2176
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:24,390
Okay, I almost got it.

2177
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:25,030
Oh, nice!

2178
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:26,710
See, look at that!

2179
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:27,970
Nothing to worry about!

2180
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:30,270
Oh shit!

2181
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:31,070
Okay, I did miss.

2182
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:32,390
Here we go.

2183
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:33,950
And then... whoop!

2184
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:35,850
I told you guys.

2185
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:36,510
See?

2186
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:37,690
Nothing to worry about.

2187
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:40,610
Who needs stealth?

2188
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:44,690
Who needs stealth when I have all this fucking loot?

2189
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:46,750
Oh, I can rob them too!

2190
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:47,950
Give me a sec.

2191
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,950
We're gonna go to the...

2192
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:52,350
We're gonna go to the base and rob them.

2193
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:53,690
Give me a sec, guys.

2194
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:55,310
This is very important.

2195
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:57,110
Weeeeee!

2196
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:00,410
There should be nobody here anymore, cause I...

2197
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:02,170
Didn't kill them!

2198
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:02,990
They ran away!

2199
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:04,750
Loot!

2200
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:06,090
Yes!

2201
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:07,830
Got more loot!

2202
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:09,310
Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot!

2203
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:13,890
Why would I run away when I know I'm better?

2204
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:18,750
Are there Royal Army soldiers all over Sandland?

2205
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:20,810
There's even a bunch near our village!

2206
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:24,390
Most of them are stationed near the Royal Capital.

2207
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:28,110
It can be a lot more hit and miss the farther you get away from them.

2208
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:29,170
No, I can't.

2209
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:33,690
You'll also see supply units traveling around as they transport goods to bases.

2210
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:38,490
Those are probably the ones who passed near our village.

2211
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:41,090
Alright.

2212
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:41,650
Nice.

2213
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:43,410
Look at all the loot I got!

2214
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:46,970
If I listened to him...

2215
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:47,950
Wait, can I beat this...

2216
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:48,470
Ugh!

2217
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:49,310
There we go.

2218
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:57,810
If I had listened to him, I wouldn't have got all this good loot.

2219
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:00,450
How do I get up there though?

2220
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,410
I should grab the tank.

2221
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:04,250
Loot, loot, loot.

2222
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:05,170
Stealth is for the weak?

2223
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:05,830
Exactly!

2224
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:10,850
Stealth is for people who are weak and don't know how to...

2225
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:14,990
And know they can't beat them up by pure strength.

2226
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:24,650
Stealth is for cowards!

2227
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:29,110
Yeah, this is why you don't listen to Elder.

2228
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:33,430
They don't know what's good for you.

2229
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:37,610
Your information is outdated.

2230
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:41,710
It's because this old man is so fucking weak.

2231
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:45,790
So that's why he was not confident in beating the army up.

2232
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,940
Let me grab this...

2233
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,000
Oh my god!

2234
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:54,200
I can have a dino!

2235
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,000
Alright, guys.

2236
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:01,480
This is mine.

2237
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:02,640
This is better.

2238
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:02,800
Better.

2239
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,440
Like what do I do with the camp?

2240
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,100
Anyway...

2241
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,760
Like I don't need a rest because I never get off the...

2242
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:13,980
I never get off the fucking tank.

2243
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:17,180
Finally...

2244
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,880
Riding my true...

2245
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:22,480
Riding my true vehicle.

2246
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,000
The guy, thank you for the super chat!

2247
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,880
Thank you, thank you!

2248
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,220
I really appreciate it.

2249
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:32,740
Let's see...

2250
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:35,960
Barret, thank you for the super chat!

2251
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:36,780
Thank you, thank you!

2252
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,640
You caused a heart attack when they gazed upon you, so...

2253
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:39,980
Murder!

2254
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,260
Thank you for the super chat!

2255
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:41,900
Thank you, thank you!

2256
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:42,760
They can look away!

2257
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,660
Just close your eyes!

2258
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,780
How do you get murdered?

2259
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:46,720
Just close your eyes!

2260
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,200
Wait,

2261
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,040
he has a shield.

2262
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,420
Does the shield actually...

2263
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:00,260
stop a fucking cannon shot?

2264
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:09,540
They do?

2265
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,360
Wait, who is that?

2266
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:15,960
Wait, oh that's the general!

2267
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,040
General Ace.

2268
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:27,840
Are you ready for this?

2269
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:30,460
Like you have to ask!

2270
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:35,540
How many times must I tell you to address him as Prince Beelzebub?

2271
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,000
Ok, I'm curious if this stops the fuck...

2272
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Ok, it does not...

2273
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,140
Hahaha, I was gonna say, like...

2274
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:46,100
How the fuck is like...

2275
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,840
How the fuck does the fucking...

2276
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,100
Shield stop a cannon?

2277
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,560
That's actually...

2278
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,220
Like, that's very...

2279
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:54,880
Oh, that's my guy.

2280
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:55,280
Sorry.

2281
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,120
I accidentally stopped...

2282
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,140
I accidentally shot Rao.

2283
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,240
Whoops!

2284
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,320
My bad!

2285
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:03,940
My bad!

2286
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:09,120
That was Rell, guys.

2287
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,700
I'm sorry!

2288
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:15,880
He needs to paint his tank a different color!

2289
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,320
Thank you for the super chat!

2290
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:24,800
Thank you!

2291
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,380
Vtubers are so cute!

2292
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:29,640
I think it's like cute!

2293
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,600
God, I wish women were real.

2294
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:32,500
I know, man.

2295
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:33,420
It's too bad.

2296
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:37,080
It's too bad Vtubers aren't real and women aren't real either.

2297
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:41,040
We're all just AI.

2298
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,580
They read us like a book.

2299
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,520
This commander is a pro.

2300
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:55,140
So you're saying this was all for nothing?

2301
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:58,040
No, I think we can get it fixed.

2302
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:01,100
We all know women on the internet aren't real.

2303
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:04,600
It's all just men with voice changers.

2304
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:08,140
We can use this to find out about the area!

2305
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:09,400
We can repair it!

2306
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,120
Can I repair it?

2307
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:11,300
I have so much materials!

2308
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:11,960
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2309
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,420
I've been scavenging for so long.

2310
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:15,860
There's no way I don't have materials.

2311
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,040
Am I

2312
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:25,010
a man?

2313
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:26,210
Yes.

2314
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:30,090
Women aren't real on the internet, guys.

2315
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:30,950
This is Shiva.

2316
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:33,690
Former General Shiva.

2317
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:38,490
I have something I want to tell the people of this country.

2318
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:40,650
If you'll let me transmit it.

2319
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:42,830
Yes.

2320
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:44,470
Right away, please.

2321
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:51,350
We have just received radio contact from a man claiming to be General Shiva himself.

2322
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:51,450
I'm sorry.

2323
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:52,750
What?

2324
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:57,590
He has a message for you all.

2325
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:03,950
And while we have not been able to confirm his identity, we have agreed to transmit his words live on air.

2326
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:05,190
Don't worry, I'll always be your bro.

2327
01:43:07,230 --> 01:43:12,710
I'm actually surprised they let them trans... like... let them transmit his message.

2328
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:18,430
First, allow me to sincerely apologize to you all for any distress I may have caused.

2329
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:21,970
All units, cut the engines!

2330
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:23,150
Make it quiet!

2331
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:30,030
I freely confess to the crime of stealing a tank.

2332
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:36,510
But unlike what you were told previously, I have not attacked any villages with it.

2333
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:38,890
I swear this on my life.

2334
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:40,090
Yeah, I'm Brokey Bird.

2335
01:43:40,570 --> 01:43:42,610
I'll always be your bro, bro.

2336
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:45,710
It is not my aim to spread panic and confusion amid this country.

2337
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:51,950
I intend only to find the legendary spring which I assure you is no mere dream.

2338
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:52,770
It is a mere fairy tale.

2339
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:56,990
For this country cannot withstand any more drought.

2340
01:43:59,670 --> 01:43:59,990
Spring?

2341
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:01,710
Did he say spring?

2342
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:06,230
What is he even talking about?

2343
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:12,070
So please, just allow me to finish this mission without interference.

2344
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:17,810
When I find the spring, I promise to make its location public...

2345
01:44:17,810 --> 01:44:21,450
Okay, but like, is this like the only spring in the whole fucking world?

2346
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:23,110
Wouldn't that be like...

2347
01:44:23,110 --> 01:44:27,270
I feel like the spring will get like quickly depleted.

2348
01:44:27,670 --> 01:44:30,290
Because humans are greedy.

2349
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:36,590
There's no way the spring is gonna feed the entire population in Sad Land.

2350
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,370
...on an entirely different subject.

2351
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:48,790
Though this doesn't absolve my role in causing that explosion 30 years ago, I've learned the truth behind it.

2352
01:44:51,110 --> 01:44:51,930
Yeah, it would be a good idea to...

2353
01:44:51,930 --> 01:44:53,130
It would dry up in like a week.

2354
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:53,990
Wouldn't it?

2355
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:57,970
It could be a legendary spring.

2356
01:44:59,410 --> 01:45:00,650
Oh my god.

2357
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:03,250
Just say it.

2358
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:09,390
Why didn't you just fucking call him out?

2359
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:10,570
I'd call him out.

2360
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:20,830
I'd be like, bro, guys, by the way, I sort of committed like an extreme war crime because like I didn't save you guys and we actually wiped off the only race that was gonna give us free water.

2361
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:25,150
Fuck you, General whatever your name is, because I already forgot you're that irrelevant to me.

2362
01:45:26,190 --> 01:45:27,790
Contact the news office immediately.

2363
01:45:28,410 --> 01:45:34,450
Tell them that they are never to allow that criminal to speak freely on air again.

2364
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:39,250
This is bad, isn't it, Zeyu?

2365
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:42,690
He said something about the truth behind that explosion.

2366
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:44,910
Why didn't he just reveal it?

2367
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:48,410
This is the only time he's ever gonna be allowed in the air.

2368
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:49,490
Like...

2369
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:52,110
He should have just revealed everything.

2370
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:06,790
He don't want to slander anyone.

2371
01:46:06,930 --> 01:46:10,230
He literally said, I will never forgive you, Commander Zuu.

2372
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:23,210
Like, they're just gonna censor him now.

2373
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:26,370
Alright, phew.

2374
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:27,190
Alright.

2375
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:29,850
I feel like I can upgrade my tank now for now, right?

2376
01:46:30,190 --> 01:46:31,450
I have so much materials.

2377
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:33,250
I have so much mats.

2378
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,350
I must be able to.

2379
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:35,910
Alright, better Dragoon.

2380
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:37,330
What do you need, baby?

2381
01:46:42,490 --> 01:46:45,450
Better Dragoon doesn't need anything.

2382
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:47,170
He's already better.

2383
01:46:50,350 --> 01:46:52,230
Your vehicle is too low level?

2384
01:46:52,430 --> 01:46:53,230
Oh my...

2385
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:54,690
This is why your Dragoon...

2386
01:46:57,170 --> 01:47:00,630
This is why your Dragoon won.

2387
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:04,790
Let's see.

2388
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:09,050
You're too low level for even upgrades.

2389
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:10,850
I need...

2390
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:12,870
Neglected again.

2391
01:47:13,610 --> 01:47:15,110
He's already perfect.

2392
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:19,210
I'm gonna...

2393
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:20,310
Can I just jump down?

2394
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:22,590
Okay, look.

2395
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:24,610
I know we learned that we can't.

2396
01:47:24,650 --> 01:47:25,630
But like...

2397
01:47:26,150 --> 01:47:27,070
What if I...

2398
01:47:27,070 --> 01:47:27,290
Wait.

2399
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:28,750
Can I just fast travel?

2400
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:29,170
Oh no.

2401
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:30,230
It's like right over here.

2402
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:31,010
But what if I like...

2403
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:31,410
Watch this.

2404
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:32,170
It's gonna be like...

2405
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:33,110
I'm gonna Skyrim this.

2406
01:47:39,730 --> 01:47:40,970
That's why you know I'm a gamer.

2407
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:45,510
That's why you guys watch me.

2408
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:47,150
That's why you guys watch me.

2409
01:47:47,150 --> 01:47:49,690
You know other VTubers won't do this.

2410
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:56,130
I make my own pathways.

2411
01:47:56,350 --> 01:47:59,310
I don't follow what society tells me to.

2412
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:08,770
Does that even...

2413
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:09,110
No way.

2414
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:29,310
No, they don't believe this.

2415
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:30,610
That's good.

2416
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:31,150
Oh, I see.

2417
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:31,170
Okay.

2418
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:34,990
That's it for the...

2419
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:35,270
Oh noises.

2420
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:37,630
We have more to talk about here.

2421
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:40,850
Where the Chen is the...

2422
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:41,410
Oh, so the answer is fake.

2423
01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:42,970
The hint says excuse me, tables, one.

2424
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:46,530
Oh, okay.

2425
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:46,670
Where else should we talk about this situation.

2426
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:46,890
...

2427
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:47,110
So...

2428
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:06,300
His father was killed in that explosion?

2429
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,560
Wait, what if he's like secretly the son?

2430
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:13,920
Is he like... is this guy 30?

2431
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:21,820
He has daddy issues and the other guy's a dad.

2432
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,360
He...

2433
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:50,200
Do your thing!

2434
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:54,080
He's got right at the midpoint between Shiva and the royal army.

2435
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:56,400
Got it, papa.

2436
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,800
There's so many dads.

2437
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:03,820
It's Shiva!

2438
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,980
All tanks, prepare to remodel!

2439
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:09,200
It's like the first bomb in Fallout!

2440
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,660
Enemy tank brigade!

2441
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:12,840
Oh my god!

2442
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,200
They started it!

2443
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:15,800
What?

2444
01:50:16,830 --> 01:50:18,040
They're like Vault-Tec!

2445
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:20,180
Prepare to engage!

2446
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:21,080
Hurry!

2447
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:23,100
They shot first!

2448
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:24,440
Dadland!

2449
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:31,000
I love how

2450
01:50:35,630 --> 01:50:37,370
each tank has like different eyes.

2451
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:40,030
War never changes.

2452
01:50:40,730 --> 01:50:45,510
Prince, take cover behind the rocks and swing around in the other direction to attack them!

2453
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:47,850
Wait, which... which rock?

2454
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:50,670
Whoa!

2455
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:52,390
Which rock though?

2456
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:54,030
Oh, I'm so happy!

2457
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:54,810
I'm so happy!

2458
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:59,050
Oh, there's so many rocks!

2459
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:00,290
There's so many rocks!

2460
01:51:01,070 --> 01:51:02,130
Wait, is this mine?

2461
01:51:02,330 --> 01:51:03,070
This is mine.

2462
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:03,770
Sorry.

2463
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:05,290
I couldn't tell.

2464
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:07,130
Wait, where's the other tank?

2465
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:08,630
Whoa!

2466
01:51:08,990 --> 01:51:10,090
That's the other tank!

2467
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:11,350
Oh shit!

2468
01:51:11,530 --> 01:51:12,890
Oh shit, he also missed!

2469
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:15,470
Nice.

2470
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:19,410
Is that it?

2471
01:51:19,410 --> 01:51:19,530
Is that it?

2472
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:22,070
It's okay.

2473
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:23,070
He's okay.

2474
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:23,810
My tank's okay.

2475
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:41,190
Yeah, where's the commander?

2476
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:46,490
Whoa!

2477
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:46,710
Whoa!

2478
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:53,010
There he is!

2479
01:51:54,090 --> 01:51:56,450
Wait, why does his tank get to be a different color?

2480
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:58,050
It's not fair!

2481
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:02,370
If I kill the commander, do I win?

2482
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:07,010
Oh my god, I'm so... Oh, it won't end.

2483
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:08,170
I actually have to take him out.

2484
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:10,730
Where's the blind spot?

2485
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:11,810
Where did he go?

2486
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:13,110
Oh shit.

2487
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:14,390
Okay, did I hit him?

2488
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:15,750
Alright.

2489
01:52:15,810 --> 01:52:16,470
If I go up here...

2490
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:17,370
He can't get me.

2491
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:19,650
That's not him.

2492
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:21,490
Alright, he can't hit me from here.

2493
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:22,370
Oh shit!

2494
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:23,650
Guys...

2495
01:52:24,430 --> 01:52:25,430
Oh my god.

2496
01:52:25,490 --> 01:52:26,470
Thank god I like...

2497
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:28,150
I repaired it in time.

2498
01:52:28,710 --> 01:52:29,110
Rouse!

2499
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:29,930
Shoot your son!

2500
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:31,690
It's okay!

2501
01:52:31,890 --> 01:52:35,010
This might be like your very last, like, remaining relative.

2502
01:52:37,290 --> 01:52:38,930
Because you killed your wife as well.

2503
01:52:39,090 --> 01:52:40,450
But you might as well kill your son.

2504
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:40,770
You know?

2505
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:41,790
Double whammy.

2506
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:47,130
What's the minimum to survive?

2507
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:51,970
So I promised my village that I would find the legendary spring.

2508
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:54,230
Oh my god.

2509
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:56,190
He does so much damage.

2510
01:52:57,410 --> 01:52:58,890
What the fuck?

2511
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:00,350
Did you truly believe that such a spring exists?

2512
01:53:02,650 --> 01:53:03,250
Unbelievable.

2513
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:05,390
He's superhuman.

2514
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:07,310
What do you mean he?

2515
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:09,030
I did majority of the work.

2516
01:53:09,210 --> 01:53:12,030
He completely disabled our unit with zero loss of life!

2517
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:15,590
He was exactly the man my father said he was.

2518
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:23,670
Oh, his father said he was?

2519
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:26,290
Oh, so that means he was... that's not the son then.

2520
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:34,030
Because he's like, oh my father said he was... so he actually talked to his dad.

2521
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:42,640
I finished this so fast that we even get to hear 50% of that dialogue.

2522
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:50,740
You mentioned the truth behind the explosion 30 years ago.

2523
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:52,140
What is it?

2524
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,660
You may not want to hear it.

2525
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:59,480
I believe it, but I've got no hard proof.

2526
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:07,080
I am Aure, the son of Apo, one of your very own officers.

2527
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,100
Please, tell me.

2528
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:13,560
I need to know the truth of my father's death.

2529
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:16,760
Apo's son, eh?

2530
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,380
I see.

2531
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:20,880
Very well then.

2532
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:22,540
Who's Apo?

2533
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:23,440
Thief.

2534
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:24,700
You're our source.

2535
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,720
He should hear it from you.

2536
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:31,680
You've got to be.

2537
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:33,540
Must I do everything around here?

2538
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,440
Bro, all you do is sit around.

2539
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:39,740
Don't tell me you heard this story from him?

2540
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:41,640
Yeah, he's the demon.

2541
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:44,320
You take the word of a demon?

2542
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,480
That doesn't kill.

2543
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:48,400
If you won't listen to me, you won't be able to hear me.

2544
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:49,420
I'm not going to listen to what he has to say.

2545
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,400
I can't force you.

2546
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:51,760
But let me say this.

2547
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:57,140
In this whole twisted world, I haven't met anyone as honest as these two.

2548
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:57,780
That's like...

2549
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,420
That's so fucked up.

2550
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,140
I consider them like fucking demons.

2551
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:11,120
They might as well just not be demons at that point.

2552
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:15,480
I trust them far, far more than any human at least.

2553
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:22,900
Like what the fuck is the point of having demons if you're not more evil than humans?

2554
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:24,360
Like...

2555
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:27,740
Just like how our fear and suspicion of the peachy caused terrible tragedy.

2556
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:29,760
Demons should be like the benchmark of evil.

2557
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,780
Not the fucking middle.

2558
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:35,360
What do you mean by that?

2559
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:39,740
Yeah, he means humans are worse.

2560
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:43,080
We're at the point where like humans are worse than demons.

2561
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:45,380
Ugh!

2562
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,980
Bunch of spineless cowards!

2563
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:50,480
What's happening in this game?

2564
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,300
It's so confusing.

2565
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:54,220
We're in a land filled with sand.

2566
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:55,280
And there's tanks.

2567
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,880
And we're trying to find water.

2568
01:55:58,060 --> 01:55:59,400
Because it's all sand.

2569
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,380
The end.

2570
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:04,400
Guppy!

2571
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:05,200
Do your thing!

2572
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:18,660
Damn it!

2573
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:21,600
What the fuck?

2574
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:22,840
What?

2575
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:25,220
You can do that?

2576
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:28,300
Why can't I do that in game?

2577
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:29,740
What was that just now?

2578
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:31,260
No.

2579
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,720
Don't tell me there was another tank.

2580
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:35,320
No.

2581
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:37,420
It came from somewhere above us.

2582
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:39,460
I'll hop up high and look around.

2583
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,320
Don't worry it's parkour time.

2584
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:46,300
I can't believe that humans are worse than demons now.

2585
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:48,800
Like what's the point of being a demon?

2586
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:50,160
Might as well be a human.

2587
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,460
Like they already fucking took our jobs.

2588
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:54,700
The humans took our fucking jobs.

2589
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:55,580
It's the swimmers!

2590
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:57,500
Those little...

2591
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:58,320
He's gonna swear.

2592
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:01,620
Beelzebub spotted us!

2593
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:04,220
Grr!

2594
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,200
Grr!

2595
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:07,120
Time to split!

2596
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:11,510
Dang it!

2597
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:12,690
They got away again!

2598
01:57:12,970 --> 01:57:15,230
I'm gonna pulverize them next time!

2599
01:57:17,590 --> 01:57:20,110
That Beelzebub just saved our lives.

2600
01:57:20,990 --> 01:57:23,010
As any demon would do.

2601
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:28,590
Perhaps it's true that we've misjudged the demons.

2602
01:57:30,650 --> 01:57:32,470
Alright, I'll hear it.

2603
01:57:32,970 --> 01:57:36,570
Tell me the story of what caused the explosion 30 years ago, thief.

2604
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:38,610
Nope.

2605
01:57:38,710 --> 01:57:40,770
Not till I hear the magic word.

2606
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:42,190
Please?

2607
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:43,830
What?

2608
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:45,210
You let me go?

2609
01:57:45,230 --> 01:57:45,630
You little imp!

2610
01:57:45,870 --> 01:57:47,330
Who do you think you're?

2611
01:57:49,390 --> 01:57:50,550
Silence you!

2612
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:53,350
Beelzebub?

2613
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:56,470
Please just tell me!

2614
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:58,110
Please?

2615
01:58:00,410 --> 01:58:02,150
That's so attractive.

2616
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:08,250
Please?

2617
01:58:08,650 --> 01:58:09,690
Please sir?

2618
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:11,250
Tell me please!

2619
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:12,890
I'm begging you on my knees!

2620
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:13,750
Please!

2621
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:15,210
Please sir?

2622
01:58:15,230 --> 01:58:16,670
That's so true!

2623
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:17,510
No!

2624
01:58:18,290 --> 01:58:20,150
Surely that can't be true!

2625
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:22,190
Please, Donkey, please!

2626
01:58:22,250 --> 01:58:24,110
I know commanders say you as a cold man.

2627
01:58:24,330 --> 01:58:26,590
But I can't believe he could be so inhuman.

2628
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:30,070
Well, we've said our piece.

2629
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:34,610
And sorry, but it looks like we'll have to borrow the tank a bit longer.

2630
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:37,410
But it

2631
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:40,700
looks like we'll have to borrow the tank a bit longer.

2632
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:41,700
Sir, are you sure?

2633
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:42,040
Sir, are you sure?

2634
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,220
Should we really be letting Shiva go like this?

2635
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:44,560
Should we really be letting Shiva go like this?

2636
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:45,920
Yes, we trust him!

2637
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,500
What do you mean by that?

2638
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,760
We never had him to begin with.

2639
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:53,620
Bro, we literally beat the shitter of him!

2640
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:54,180
Bro, we literally beat the shitter of him!

2641
01:58:54,180 --> 01:58:55,900
And he hadn't even finished his dialogue!

2642
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:57,500
He didn't even finish his plot!

2643
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:59,860
We almost did.

2644
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:02,700
Until the swimmers struck out of nowhere, that is.

2645
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,320
They took out our tanks.

2646
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:06,540
Then fled.

2647
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:09,420
That is what happened.

2648
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,820
That is what happened.

2649
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:12,740
Sir, yes sir!

2650
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:14,860
Oh my god, he's gonna lie!

2651
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:17,700
Oh my god, he's gonna lie!

2652
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:19,380
I'm gonna report to Supreme Commander Zeyu.

2653
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:20,420
No.

2654
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:23,700
There's something I have to confirm with the King first.

2655
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:26,260
He's gonna blame the swimmers!

2656
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:28,600
He's gonna blame the swimmers!

2657
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:29,220
Oh my god!

2658
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:29,940
Finally!

2659
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:33,240
To pick well...

2660
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:35,140
I was gonna say, why can't I do that?

2661
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:41,740
How did I fucking suddenly realize I learned how to throw rocks?

2662
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:42,160
How did I fucking suddenly realize I learned how to throw rocks?

2663
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:42,480
How did I fucking suddenly realize I learned how to throw rocks?

2664
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,540
I feel like I should know how to throw rocks originally.

2665
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:47,680
I feel like I should know how to throw rocks originally.

2666
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:48,040
It took so long.

2667
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:52,500
Use R, B and then pick B to pick up a boulder from the ground.

2668
01:59:52,580 --> 01:59:53,020
Interpret one.

2669
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:53,760
Throw them...

2670
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,540
Okay.

2671
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:55,620
Yay!

2672
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:01,000
We can head south.

2673
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:01,400
Let's go!

2674
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,500
Time to head south!

2675
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:06,780
They're already here.

2676
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,060
That was easy.

2677
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:11,440
We did it.

2678
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,260
I'm stronger now.

2679
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:15,020
Oh, you're right.

2680
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:15,800
I leveled up.

2681
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:16,260
I guess.

2682
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:19,340
It's the ocean.

2683
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:20,140
It's the sand ocean.

2684
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:23,180
Roiling quicksand everywhere you look.

2685
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:26,080
One wrong step and you'll be swallowed up.

2686
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:29,220
Don't worry.

2687
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:31,300
I'm light as a feather.

2688
02:00:33,620 --> 02:00:36,100
Okay, we started to prove that that was not true.

2689
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,360
Bro,

2690
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:45,140
he forgot that we drowned in the sand water?

2691
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:54,400
Anyway, we can't proceed south unless we figure out how to get past this one.

2692
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:55,620
We're gonna get water dragoons!

2693
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:57,920
How are we supposed to do that?

2694
02:00:58,220 --> 02:00:59,300
Even the prince...

2695
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:00,700
We're gonna be like a dragoon boat!

2696
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:02,740
None of our bots will help either.

2697
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:06,080
The tank or jump bot would only be even worse off.

2698
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:08,320
If it didn't happen in the cutscene, doesn't count.

2699
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:09,480
So true.

2700
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:11,440
It would be easy if we could just fly over it.

2701
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,560
But with planes outlawed...

2702
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:14,780
Yeah, but how would they know?

2703
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:16,340
How would they know that?

2704
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:17,860
What if we just, you know...

2705
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,360
Oh, I like those geckos!

2706
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:21,480
I can run on water!

2707
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:23,320
Explain, please.

2708
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:31,030
It kinda felt like I was sinking more slowly while I was running.

2709
02:01:33,570 --> 02:01:34,090
Aha!

2710
02:01:34,410 --> 02:01:37,150
Cross before sinking to the point of no return, eh?

2711
02:01:38,430 --> 02:01:41,190
Prince, thief, let's head back to Spino.

2712
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:44,350
Let me guess...

2713
02:01:44,350 --> 02:01:46,450
And to the rescue again?

2714
02:01:48,390 --> 02:01:50,310
What's wrong with letting Anne help?

2715
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:52,110
It's because she...

2716
02:01:52,110 --> 02:01:55,870
Oh my god, he's fucking sexist because she's a woman, isn't she?

2717
02:01:56,490 --> 02:01:57,790
Alright, let's see...

2718
02:01:57,790 --> 02:01:59,090
Spino, where's Spino?

2719
02:02:00,610 --> 02:02:03,510
Why is he so against having Anne help us?

2720
02:02:04,570 --> 02:02:05,450
She's like...

2721
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:09,430
One of the three women we met here.

2722
02:02:10,330 --> 02:02:11,450
Oh my god, shit.

2723
02:02:14,130 --> 02:02:14,730
Wait...

2724
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:17,690
Let's see...

2725
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:21,410
Where the fuck is Spino?

2726
02:02:21,570 --> 02:02:22,150
Oh, there it is.

2727
02:02:22,290 --> 02:02:23,850
I was like, where's Spino?

2728
02:02:23,850 --> 02:02:26,430
The giant checkpoint right there?

2729
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:31,110
There's like three women in Sandland.

2730
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:36,760
Closing up shop already?

2731
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:40,460
Yeah.

2732
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,720
There's someone I have to meet right now.

2733
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:47,560
Someone from the Royal Army?

2734
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:49,940
Or maybe the news office?

2735
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:54,480
Why would you think that?

2736
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:59,560
You've been acting strange ever since the warning about the...

2737
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:01,300
Oh my god, she's gonna rat us out for money!

2738
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:01,920
...the time she's been hiding here.

2739
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:05,360
I'm sure you've figured out who we are by now.

2740
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:09,740
You saw right through me.

2741
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:11,160
You saw right through me.

2742
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:12,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2743
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:15,540
So you were planning on ratting us out in the Royal Army?

2744
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:16,420
How dare she!

2745
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:19,420
After everything we've been through!

2746
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:20,000
You put in a whole town in here.

2747
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:22,460
You're in danger by letting you people stay here.

2748
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:26,880
Your concerns are justified.

2749
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:31,200
We don't intend to cause you good people any trouble.

2750
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:33,500
We promise to never come back here.

2751
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:33,520
Get her!

2752
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,380
Now we have two women left in Sandland.

2753
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:40,480
Just please, allow Anne to keep staying here.

2754
02:03:41,820 --> 02:03:44,080
She's a personal guest of Mayor Torr's.

2755
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:46,140
And had no part in the theft of the...

2756
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:48,020
What do you mean, you people?

2757
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,760
Well, in that case, fine.

2758
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:56,700
Hold on.

2759
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:59,820
We all busted out of the base in that tank to get...

2760
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,960
Prince, thief, let's get going.

2761
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:03,180
No!

2762
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:04,960
This is our only home!

2763
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:06,780
We're gonna miss that garage.

2764
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:08,400
It was like our secret hideout.

2765
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:11,220
I didn't get a chance to customize this town!

2766
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:12,980
I got 50 chairs!

2767
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:13,900
Let's not be so...

2768
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,860
What am I gonna do with 50 chairs?

2769
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:18,300
Mayor Torr!

2770
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:21,420
80s...

2771
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:23,860
Don't you know what these people are doing?

2772
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:26,340
They've been trying to find a spring.

2773
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:30,740
And not just for their own personal benefit, mind you.

2774
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,880
They're trying to help everyone.

2775
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:35,520
Yeah, all five people in this town.

2776
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:39,860
Sorry, four soon after Anne's gone.

2777
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:44,320
Sorry to add, 80s is after 80s is gone, too.

2778
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:46,700
Probably.

2779
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:51,000
But I can't stand the sight of people who stand by as the people of this nation suffer any longer.

2780
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:55,600
Even if it means putting your life at risk.

2781
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:59,360
That is not my name anymore.

2782
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:01,460
Yeah, it's Raurr.

2783
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:03,100
Raurr.

2784
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:03,820
Raurr.

2785
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:06,700
I'm pretty sure in Japanese it sounds a lot better.

2786
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:09,060
In English it's so hard to pronounce.

2787
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:10,160
Raurr.

2788
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:16,450
You heard the man.

2789
02:05:17,370 --> 02:05:19,350
How about this, 80s?

2790
02:05:20,050 --> 02:05:20,670
Toriyama style game.

2791
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:22,830
It's the last game Toriyama was involved in.

2792
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:43,190
To be fair, 30 million yen I would turn myself into.

2793
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:44,750
Not 30 million.

2794
02:05:44,930 --> 02:05:46,430
30 million zen.

2795
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:49,790
I love how it's called zen.

2796
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:50,990
Instead of yen.

2797
02:05:53,110 --> 02:05:53,610
Hello.

2798
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:55,510
Oh my god.

2799
02:05:55,610 --> 02:05:56,770
Two of the four villages.

2800
02:06:03,070 --> 02:06:05,090
Oh, DK12 might be the last one.

2801
02:06:20,530 --> 02:06:21,910
But one of them does not care about a single thing.

2802
02:06:22,290 --> 02:06:25,950
So, I've been looking around.

2803
02:06:27,730 --> 02:06:30,710
I'll go with another team.

2804
02:06:30,710 --> 02:06:31,050
Really?

2805
02:06:32,070 --> 02:06:32,310
Yes, please.

2806
02:06:32,310 --> 02:06:34,270
But the party I'm going to is the Goa, where I'll be going with my friends.

2807
02:06:34,770 --> 02:06:36,370
Oh, I see.

2808
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:37,630
But you like your party.

2809
02:06:38,290 --> 02:06:39,130
So do I.

2810
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:39,850
Tsk.

2811
02:06:42,070 --> 02:06:42,670
I'll take my place.

2812
02:06:42,670 --> 02:06:44,090
I'm sorry we gave you the wrong idea.

2813
02:06:50,610 --> 02:06:51,790
Oh my god!

2814
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:54,250
She's getting welcomed in the community!

2815
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:58,210
Oh, they don't know it.

2816
02:06:58,550 --> 02:07:00,470
We'll know they're isolating her already.

2817
02:07:00,890 --> 02:07:01,110
Hahaha!

2818
02:07:03,970 --> 02:07:04,550
Whoa!

2819
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:12,890
I like how we're like, yeah, we're eavesdropping.

2820
02:07:14,090 --> 02:07:15,910
I'm glad you'll be standing guard at the garage.

2821
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:17,930
And stay put.

2822
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:20,510
Leave convincing the villagers to us.

2823
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:22,010
You got it!

2824
02:07:22,410 --> 02:07:24,370
It's only two other villagers.

2825
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:27,510
You might have to wait for a bit, but we owe her an apology.

2826
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:29,910
As we stand in front of her?

2827
02:07:32,110 --> 02:07:36,070
You might have to wait for a bit, but we owe her an apology.

2828
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:40,970
I like how we just listen to it in front of her.

2829
02:07:41,550 --> 02:07:42,070
80s!

2830
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:43,810
Fuck you, 80s!

2831
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:46,030
Is it true that you want to report Shiva?

2832
02:07:46,310 --> 02:07:46,830
Yeah!

2833
02:07:47,090 --> 02:07:48,430
How dare you!

2834
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:52,290
How else am I gonna look at that hot lady working on cars?

2835
02:07:53,030 --> 02:07:54,290
Yeah, that's right.

2836
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:55,670
I would have done it too.

2837
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:56,750
If Mayor Twain hadn't stopped you.

2838
02:07:56,750 --> 02:07:58,390
If it wasn't for those meddling kids.

2839
02:07:59,050 --> 02:08:00,610
And he was right too.

2840
02:08:00,850 --> 02:08:04,690
We won't submit to the Royal Army's threats, even if it kills us.

2841
02:08:05,550 --> 02:08:08,550
Oh, are you still carping about that?

2842
02:08:08,710 --> 02:08:10,990
The Civil War is long since over.

2843
02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:13,450
For 30 years...

2844
02:08:13,450 --> 02:08:14,270
Exile her!

2845
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:18,130
She wants to get rid of Anne!

2846
02:08:20,990 --> 02:08:27,210
The Royal Army is still the same bunch of jackbooted thugs they were back then.

2847
02:08:27,890 --> 02:08:31,390
And I won't stop fighting until that changes.

2848
02:08:32,490 --> 02:08:33,850
Good grief.

2849
02:08:34,950 --> 02:08:40,830
Once his temper flares, all you can do is wait for him to cool down on his own.

2850
02:08:41,450 --> 02:08:43,070
Just leave him be.

2851
02:08:43,810 --> 02:08:48,470
That said, I don't think we should report General Shiva either.

2852
02:08:49,010 --> 02:08:52,870
He may have been our enemy in the past, but he's...

2853
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:53,270
Yeah!

2854
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:55,370
He's reformed!

2855
02:08:55,370 --> 02:08:56,050
He's old!

2856
02:08:56,190 --> 02:08:56,930
He's like 60!

2857
02:08:57,030 --> 02:08:57,990
What's he gonna do?

2858
02:08:58,270 --> 02:08:59,210
We can push him!

2859
02:09:00,570 --> 02:09:04,390
If the elderly starts acting up, just push them!

2860
02:09:05,010 --> 02:09:06,330
I trust him.

2861
02:09:07,730 --> 02:09:09,930
Don't push the elderly in real life, guys.

2862
02:09:10,110 --> 02:09:10,810
Don't do that.

2863
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:12,010
Don't listen to Doki advice.

2864
02:09:12,290 --> 02:09:13,550
Sometimes they might be bad.

2865
02:09:13,810 --> 02:09:19,650
If he takes the royals down a peg in the process, I can die happy.

2866
02:09:20,550 --> 02:09:21,350
Hold on.

2867
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:24,570
Do you still hate the Royal Army too, then?

2868
02:09:25,490 --> 02:09:26,890
You have to ask?

2869
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:31,470
Like I'd ever forgive them for leaving my hometown in ruins.

2870
02:09:33,570 --> 02:09:35,970
I think I know where I stand now.

2871
02:09:37,490 --> 02:09:38,570
Vegeta's like 60.

2872
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:40,790
Yes, he's 60, but he's still a saint!

2873
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:42,450
He's not a real person!

2874
02:09:42,610 --> 02:09:43,110
Like...

2875
02:09:43,110 --> 02:09:44,190
Sorry.

2876
02:09:45,130 --> 02:09:46,970
He's not a human.

2877
02:09:47,370 --> 02:09:49,590
He's still... He's like... That's like...

2878
02:09:49,590 --> 02:09:51,450
In like, Saiyan age.

2879
02:09:51,670 --> 02:09:52,850
Whoa there.

2880
02:09:56,330 --> 02:09:58,590
Are they all talking without me?

2881
02:09:59,350 --> 02:10:00,470
Oh, he's crying.

2882
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:01,370
Why are you crying?

2883
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:04,110
What's wrong, Fleeka?

2884
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:06,390
Did you wet the bed again or something?

2885
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:08,970
No...

2886
02:10:08,970 --> 02:10:10,850
It's just that...

2887
02:10:10,850 --> 02:10:13,870
Everyone in town seems mad and...

2888
02:10:13,870 --> 02:10:14,990
I'm scared.

2889
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:23,070
Oh my god, for once I can actually talk in this conversation.

2890
02:10:23,630 --> 02:10:25,070
Instead of eavesdropping.

2891
02:10:28,110 --> 02:10:31,910
Betty, Vegeta is a real... Thank you for the super chat.

2892
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:32,850
Thank you.

2893
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:38,430
To be fair, the Saiyans, we're sort of like...

2894
02:10:38,970 --> 02:10:41,630
Didn't really have rights for a very long time.

2895
02:10:43,190 --> 02:10:44,510
To be fair.

2896
02:10:46,130 --> 02:10:46,650
To be fair.

2897
02:10:46,650 --> 02:10:49,290
But I don't want you or Beelzebub to go.

2898
02:10:50,590 --> 02:10:52,530
Maybe you should tell everyone that.

2899
02:10:53,850 --> 02:10:54,370
Okay.

2900
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:56,690
She's a good kid.

2901
02:10:57,650 --> 02:11:01,470
It's thanks to all of you that she could grow up to be so kind and carefree.

2902
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:03,270
Hmm...

2903
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:07,090
I suppose you could say it takes a village, huh?

2904
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:10,290
We don't want to disturb the community you've built here.

2905
02:11:11,370 --> 02:11:15,050
Fleeka considers all of you a part of that community too, you know.

2906
02:11:15,570 --> 02:11:20,010
This cruel world only ever seems to take more and more away from us.

2907
02:11:20,230 --> 02:11:21,690
That's why the rare gifts...

2908
02:11:21,690 --> 02:11:23,350
Why can't I give them my chairs?

2909
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:30,970
I bought the... I bought the deluxe version for the chairs.

2910
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:33,770
I'm just not sure we're right to take advantage of such kindness.

2911
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:36,070
I think we've heard enough.

2912
02:11:36,070 --> 02:11:39,650
I got 50 chairs and 50 windows apparently.

2913
02:11:40,190 --> 02:11:43,650
Like can I start customizing this goddamn town?

2914
02:11:44,890 --> 02:11:47,710
It seems we have our verdict now.

2915
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:52,150
Seems like it.

2916
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:55,110
Who knew hatred for the royal army ran so deep?

2917
02:11:57,070 --> 02:11:59,390
Not deep enough for 80s apparently.

2918
02:11:59,930 --> 02:12:01,270
Well that came out wrong.

2919
02:12:02,850 --> 02:12:03,490
See?

2920
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:05,590
There are others who support your cause.

2921
02:12:09,450 --> 02:12:12,370
Sounds like we really gotta find that spring now.

2922
02:12:13,110 --> 02:12:13,910
Guess so.

2923
02:12:16,230 --> 02:12:17,630
Alright, we gotta find water.

2924
02:12:18,370 --> 02:12:19,710
Can I talk to you now?

2925
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:25,150
Hey Anne, you gotta build us the fastest ride ever.

2926
02:12:26,590 --> 02:12:28,710
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

2927
02:12:29,330 --> 02:12:31,670
Sounds fun, but I need the deets.

2928
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:37,010
You see, some intense quicksand is blocking our path south of here.

2929
02:12:37,810 --> 02:12:41,050
We need something that can zip across it before it sinks.

2930
02:12:42,810 --> 02:12:44,670
Well, can't you use your car?

2931
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:47,130
It's too slow.

2932
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:48,970
The sand would swallow it up.

2933
02:12:50,650 --> 02:12:51,170
Hmm...

2934
02:12:51,170 --> 02:12:52,490
We need something faster.

2935
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:57,810
Maybe my bike might work.

2936
02:12:58,070 --> 02:12:58,810
Your bike?

2937
02:12:59,350 --> 02:13:00,490
Too bad I don't have it.

2938
02:13:00,730 --> 02:13:03,670
Wait, what happened to this perp- oh yeah, we lost a bike.

2939
02:13:06,570 --> 02:13:07,610
That's helpful.

2940
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:09,970
We need Chase with the Royal Army back in Talbot.

2941
02:13:10,170 --> 02:13:12,230
Is a bike faster than water sand?

2942
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:16,610
Couldn't you fix it if you had one of those core-frame wutzits?

2943
02:13:17,330 --> 02:13:17,770
Yeah.

2944
02:13:19,690 --> 02:13:22,110
Sure, but I haven't recovered that from the wreck.

2945
02:13:22,410 --> 02:13:23,650
We'll have to go get it.

2946
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:26,890
Then, that's what we'll do!

2947
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:27,910
Where is it?

2948
02:13:28,110 --> 02:13:28,990
Yeah, where is it?

2949
02:13:30,390 --> 02:13:32,770
I was pretty focused on just getting away.

2950
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:34,830
So I've only got a rough idea.

2951
02:13:34,830 --> 02:13:40,050
I know it should be somewhere north of Talbot at least.

2952
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:42,710
How specific?

2953
02:13:44,810 --> 02:13:47,890
But I think I'll be able to remember more once we get closer.

2954
02:13:49,390 --> 02:13:49,950
Good.

2955
02:13:50,110 --> 02:13:51,150
Let's go together.

2956
02:13:54,290 --> 02:13:56,390
Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.

2957
02:13:56,550 --> 02:13:57,510
What did you say?

2958
02:13:57,730 --> 02:13:58,390
We're going together!

2959
02:13:59,410 --> 02:14:01,410
I said, let's go together.

2960
02:14:01,470 --> 02:14:03,110
Yeah, you're not dead weight!

2961
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:04,630
I'm not dead weight!

2962
02:14:04,830 --> 02:14:07,370
I'm not dead weight!

2963
02:14:07,370 --> 02:14:08,910
That has to be a key for something.

2964
02:14:09,230 --> 02:14:11,470
That looks like the most key thing in the world.

2965
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:14,510
It has to be a fucking key.

2966
02:14:18,980 --> 02:14:20,100
Oh, hush.

2967
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:21,460
Let's get going already.

2968
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:26,740
Alright, let's see.

2969
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,480
We gotta find the bike.

2970
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:30,440
Oh, I gotta customize.

2971
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:31,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2972
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:33,000
We gotta upgrade our parts.

2973
02:14:33,180 --> 02:14:34,180
Ok, parts.

2974
02:14:34,180 --> 02:14:35,020
Make part.

2975
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:37,980
Can I customize my weapon?

2976
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:41,240
Let's see, but like...

2977
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:45,980
I don't know if like my stuff is stronger.

2978
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:47,040
That's the thing.

2979
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:49,980
I don't remember what my parts were technically.

2980
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:55,260
Wait, did I install it?

2981
02:14:57,860 --> 02:14:59,420
My tank too low still?

2982
02:14:59,780 --> 02:15:01,920
Your level is still too low?

2983
02:15:02,780 --> 02:15:04,440
And you upgrade my vehicle?

2984
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:06,080
Oh my god, how much...

2985
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:08,180
What level does this vehicle need?

2986
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:10,280
Customized vehicle...

2987
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:11,800
Uh, yes.

2988
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:13,600
I need to level up you.

2989
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,320
Okay, level up vehicle.

2990
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:16,460
Upgrade vehicle.

2991
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:18,660
Alright, Dragoon 1.

2992
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:22,360
It's time to get upgraded.

2993
02:15:23,860 --> 02:15:25,740
Are you strong enough now?

2994
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:27,740
You have to be.

2995
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:30,040
I wasted so many mats on you.

2996
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:31,620
Okay, parts.

2997
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:32,620
Upgrade part.

2998
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:35,420
Can you...

2999
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,240
Oh, thank god!

3000
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:37,840
Okay.

3001
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:39,240
I can upgrade you, right?

3002
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:40,100
No, I don't...

3003
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:40,840
God damn it.

3004
02:15:40,940 --> 02:15:42,440
I can't even upgrade you anymore.

3005
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:43,800
Oh, wait.

3006
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:44,560
Is that better?

3007
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:45,380
28.

3008
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:46,060
Yeah.

3009
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:49,140
Yeah, okay.

3010
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:49,980
Upgrade you?

3011
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:51,160
God damn it!

3012
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:53,380
What the fuck is Crocsteel?

3013
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:56,880
What's Crocsteel?

3014
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:01,140
Okay, let's see.

3015
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:05,480
We're gonna upgrade you.

3016
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:06,560
Upgrade.

3017
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:08,480
And then...

3018
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:09,720
Upgrade.

3019
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:14,540
Yeah, but what is it?

3020
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:19,600
Alright, I think that's all the parts.

3021
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:20,500
I'm pretty sure.

3022
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:21,160
Is it?

3023
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:22,620
Is there anything else?

3024
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:23,700
Whoa.

3025
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:27,800
We gotta sell some parts though.

3026
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:28,980
We're like...

3027
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:31,700
Yeah, I think that's everything.

3028
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:32,800
Alright.

3029
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:35,680
Weeeeee.

3030
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:38,940
Let's see.

3031
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:40,480
Is that like quest?

3032
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:41,860
Like a mini quest right here?

3033
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:43,700
What is this?

3034
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:46,240
Hello, 80s.

3035
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:52,220
That was me.

3036
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:55,040
It was!

3037
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:58,300
You truly are a lifesaver.

3038
02:16:58,900 --> 02:16:59,480
Hmph.

3039
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:01,320
Don't know what you're talking about.

3040
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:03,680
A lifesaver that you're gonna ride out!

3041
02:17:04,140 --> 02:17:05,520
Can't you just let her think?

3042
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:06,960
Yeah, silence you rat!

3043
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:10,440
I've got new wares available thanks to you.

3044
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:10,940
Oh, new items?

3045
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:11,700
Okay, nevermind.

3046
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:14,020
Everything bad I said about you, I was just joking.

3047
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:18,440
I was just joking.

3048
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:19,820
He he.

3049
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:21,740
Adhesive, clay.

3050
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:23,160
Oh, these are just...

3051
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:24,160
What about Crocsteel?

3052
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:26,000
You have Crocsteel?

3053
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:28,420
Can I like sell my materials?

3054
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:30,180
Or parts?

3055
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:30,800
Oh, there we go.

3056
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:31,320
Okay.

3057
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:35,440
Guys, I actually forgot which ones are the ones I don't need.

3058
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:39,900
I was like, aww, I don't remember!

3059
02:17:42,060 --> 02:17:43,360
I don't remember!

3060
02:17:44,660 --> 02:17:46,380
Oh, okay, we're just gonna...

3061
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:50,620
I don't remember which one I wanna sell, so we're just gonna hoard it, I guess.

3062
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:52,240
No, thank you for the...

3063
02:17:52,780 --> 02:17:54,940
Five gift of ships, thank you, thank you!

3064
02:17:56,180 --> 02:17:58,320
Alright, I already forgot which one I...

3065
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:58,400
Thank you for coming!

3066
02:17:58,400 --> 02:17:59,780
I don't remember which one I wanted to have to sell, so I'm just gonna...

3067
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:02,120
We're just gonna hoard everything, might as well.

3068
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:03,460
We don't need the money anyway.

3069
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:07,200
I feel like we farm so much that we don't even need the money.

3070
02:18:07,680 --> 02:18:08,740
I think we'll be fine.

3071
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:13,020
Alright, time to ride my dino.

3072
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:15,680
Okay, I'm gonna ride the dino.

3073
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:16,580
I'm gonna steal the dino.

3074
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:18,260
And then I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3075
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:19,120
I'll be back, guys!

3076
02:19:50,970 --> 02:19:51,610
I'm back!

3077
02:19:51,690 --> 02:19:53,090
I have to kick out...

3078
02:19:53,890 --> 02:19:57,250
I have to kick out Doki Ambri Doge real quick.

3079
02:19:59,250 --> 02:20:01,410
Because he like, sneaked into my room.

3080
02:20:01,770 --> 02:20:05,870
Alan, Maddy, and Ari and Gladstone, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

3081
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:06,550
Oh, it's this way.

3082
02:20:06,970 --> 02:20:08,910
Wait, is there a fast travel for this?

3083
02:20:11,010 --> 02:20:12,630
This has to be a fast travel, right?

3084
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:13,050
Yeah.

3085
02:20:14,310 --> 02:20:16,510
Ginger, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

3086
02:20:17,190 --> 02:20:18,810
No, my dinos!

3087
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:20,390
I can feed up the cow.

3088
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:22,510
Wait, I can feed up the cows now!

3089
02:20:22,610 --> 02:20:22,930
No!

3090
02:20:23,190 --> 02:20:23,930
The cows!

3091
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:26,450
That's looking right.

3092
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:27,890
Leave!

3093
02:20:28,810 --> 02:20:30,090
Leave this town!

3094
02:20:30,390 --> 02:20:30,890
Leave!

3095
02:20:34,690 --> 02:20:37,450
Now this town has no food anymore.

3096
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:38,450
You're welcome.

3097
02:20:43,650 --> 02:20:46,890
I'm gonna grab the tank.

3098
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:54,410
Scorpions, leave if you know what's good for you!

3099
02:20:55,010 --> 02:20:56,430
Oh my god, they like, died.

3100
02:20:56,430 --> 02:20:57,150
They died so fast.

3101
02:20:57,330 --> 02:20:57,730
Nice!

3102
02:20:58,490 --> 02:20:59,190
One down!

3103
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:02,390
I like, I interrupted her.

3104
02:21:03,490 --> 02:21:06,430
Well, obviously that's not fucking...

3105
02:21:07,430 --> 02:21:09,570
That's not the crocs deal I need.

3106
02:21:10,350 --> 02:21:12,310
Be gone, silly cows!

3107
02:21:16,190 --> 02:21:20,230
Now this town will not have any food anymore.

3108
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:22,490
You're welcome.

3109
02:21:25,530 --> 02:21:27,490
How could you, Doki?

3110
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:32,610
Oh shit, I can farm cactuses?

3111
02:21:33,870 --> 02:21:35,610
Oh, that's nice to know.

3112
02:21:37,070 --> 02:21:38,730
Wait, whose car is this?

3113
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:44,730
Wait, oh that's a bad car!

3114
02:21:44,830 --> 02:21:45,770
Oh shit!

3115
02:21:47,070 --> 02:21:48,130
That's a bad car!

3116
02:21:50,110 --> 02:21:51,790
Alright, that was a car.

3117
02:21:53,890 --> 02:21:55,550
That was a car.

3118
02:21:55,650 --> 02:21:57,890
He was just doing some fucking sick drifts.

3119
02:21:58,050 --> 02:21:59,910
And I like, interrupted him.

3120
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:07,760
Alright, these guys who are slowly running towards me.

3121
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:12,020
These were guys that were slowly running towards me.

3122
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:13,700
Sounds tough.

3123
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:15,900
This is my home now.

3124
02:22:16,380 --> 02:22:17,500
Things are better now.

3125
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:18,920
Haha!

3126
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:23,320
Nice, now I get to rob them.

3127
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:25,680
What kind of region are we in?

3128
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:32,220
Well, there should be a few towns, an army base, and a bandit hideout around here.

3129
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:33,360
Well, there should be a few towns, an army base, and a bandit hideout around here.

3130
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:34,580
Oh, there's a radio tower?

3131
02:22:35,080 --> 02:22:36,260
Soldiers and bandits.

3132
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:38,720
Now he's drifting in heaven.

3133
02:22:38,900 --> 02:22:42,120
I interrupted their fucking drift session.

3134
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:42,620
Don't let your guard down.

3135
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:44,120
Don't

3136
02:22:53,550 --> 02:22:56,610
you see that you left the bikes somewhere around these parts?

3137
02:22:56,610 --> 02:22:56,990
It's okay.

3138
02:22:57,050 --> 02:22:58,330
That raptor can join us.

3139
02:22:58,330 --> 02:22:59,030
We're in another family.

3140
02:22:59,670 --> 02:23:04,690
I killed him in the cutscene?

3141
02:23:10,690 --> 02:23:11,450
Look,

3142
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:20,220
they're the invasive species.

3143
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:21,500
These raptors.

3144
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:23,040
Oh my god!

3145
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:24,960
He took it!

3146
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:35,660
Speaking of which, I've heard that pteranos build their nests out of metal.

3147
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:37,880
Oh, they like harvested a bike.

3148
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:38,260
That's true.

3149
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:40,820
Then maybe one of them took my bike?

3150
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:43,100
It's Metal Gear!

3151
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:44,100
That's quite possible.

3152
02:23:46,020 --> 02:23:48,000
Then we should go after it.

3153
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:50,600
It's already out of sight.

3154
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:53,120
Not to worry.

3155
02:23:53,300 --> 02:23:56,200
They like to nest on rocky cliffs just like these.

3156
02:23:57,160 --> 02:24:01,020
Let's head after it and see if we can find a way up those cliffs.

3157
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:04,760
Here we go.

3158
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:04,780
Here we go.

3159
02:24:04,780 --> 02:24:07,320
Pteranodon is very sensitive to movement and shiny objects.

3160
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:07,460
That's okay.

3161
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,860
I know parkour.

3162
02:24:09,060 --> 02:24:11,720
It only takes the slightest stimulation to draw their attention.

3163
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:13,220
Watch this.

3164
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:16,300
If only it was so easy to get the prince to pay attention.

3165
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:18,940
Wait, what is that supposed to mean?

3166
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:20,000
I pay attention?

3167
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:22,080
Okay, guys.

3168
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:24,820
I might need some assistance.

3169
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:30,080
Now watch this.

3170
02:24:31,420 --> 02:24:33,340
Wait, how was I supposed to know I'd be too short?

3171
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:35,720
How the fuck was I supposed to know that?

3172
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:44,620
I'm gonna provoke them.

3173
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:49,700
I'm gonna provoke them.

3174
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:51,640
Watch this.

3175
02:24:58,660 --> 02:25:00,240
I'm gonna shoot them out of the sky.

3176
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:03,520
Nice.

3177
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:05,200
See?

3178
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:07,040
I told you.

3179
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,400
Man, thank you for the super chat.

3180
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:09,780
Thank you.

3181
02:25:09,820 --> 02:25:11,380
Your very first super.

3182
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:14,160
Thank you again.

3183
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:16,260
Alright.

3184
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:17,500
Up I go.

3185
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:19,320
Up I go.

3186
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:26,180
Wait, is that item?

3187
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:27,380
Wait, that's loot.

3188
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:28,060
Look.

3189
02:25:28,280 --> 02:25:29,000
An egg.

3190
02:25:29,460 --> 02:25:31,400
The inside of the shell is full.

3191
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:33,550
Wait, is she like...

3192
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:38,560
Oh, I was gonna say, did she like harvest somebody's fucking egg?

3193
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:44,200
I was gonna be like, that's so fucked up.

3194
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:45,180
And...

3195
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:49,860
Alright, up we go.

3196
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:53,820
I can't believe it.

3197
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:54,940
It's free too.

3198
02:25:59,050 --> 02:26:00,370
We fixed the...

3199
02:26:00,370 --> 02:26:02,490
We fixed the pterodactyl population.

3200
02:26:02,490 --> 02:26:02,830
Population.

3201
02:26:03,050 --> 02:26:04,770
The Pterodactyl population.

3202
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:06,230
Yeah!

3203
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:08,590
Oh, there it is!

3204
02:26:08,670 --> 02:26:09,390
There's the eggs!

3205
02:26:11,150 --> 02:26:12,650
Wonder where the babies went.

3206
02:26:19,470 --> 02:26:20,410
There's more loot!

3207
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:29,350
I'm gonna make this jump.

3208
02:26:29,490 --> 02:26:29,770
Weeeee!

3209
02:26:30,570 --> 02:26:31,990
I knew I would make it.

3210
02:26:32,690 --> 02:26:34,790
Oh my god, look at all these fucking free shit.

3211
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:36,430
I love free shit.

3212
02:26:37,590 --> 02:26:38,030
Check.

3213
02:26:39,370 --> 02:26:40,690
I just need Croc Steel.

3214
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:44,010
I have no... I still have no idea which one's Croc Steel.

3215
02:26:45,950 --> 02:26:46,390
Okay.

3216
02:26:46,390 --> 02:26:48,750
Alright, we need to swap to...

3217
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:51,290
We need to swap to a tank.

3218
02:26:52,130 --> 02:26:54,450
Oh, that's nice that I just noticed that like...

3219
02:26:54,450 --> 02:26:57,230
When you're in the tank, you can swap to like...

3220
02:26:57,230 --> 02:26:59,070
You don't have to get off and swap.

3221
02:26:59,810 --> 02:27:00,570
That way.

3222
02:27:01,230 --> 02:27:02,330
That's so convenient.

3223
02:27:10,530 --> 02:27:11,890
That's your bike!

3224
02:27:12,070 --> 02:27:13,810
How the fuck did it get rusted so fast?

3225
02:27:13,970 --> 02:27:14,830
It's like two days!

3226
02:27:16,310 --> 02:27:17,770
It's like two to three days!

3227
02:27:31,900 --> 02:27:32,860
Oh shit!

3228
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:35,940
I didn't kill your kids, I swear.

3229
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:36,320
Yeah!

3230
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:41,620
They just flew up and flew away from the nest.

3231
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:42,640
I swear to god.

3232
02:27:58,160 --> 02:28:01,460
I swear I didn't do anything to your kids!

3233
02:28:02,040 --> 02:28:03,940
Oh god.

3234
02:28:06,420 --> 02:28:09,160
I mean, to be fair, everything is red.

3235
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:12,160
I would assume it breathes fire because it's red.

3236
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:17,620
Just like how blue breathes ice and yellow breathes electricity.

3237
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:18,740
Whoa!

3238
02:28:20,660 --> 02:28:22,020
He's a fucking...

3239
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:22,520
Oh shit!

3240
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:23,860
Get him while he's down!

3241
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:25,500
Get him while he's down!

3242
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:29,980
Shoot him in the dick!

3243
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:31,920
Oh shit!

3244
02:28:32,340 --> 02:28:32,720
Whoa!

3245
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:32,960
Whoa!

3246
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:33,200
Whoa!

3247
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:33,400
Whoa!

3248
02:28:34,900 --> 02:28:35,420
Whoa!

3249
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:38,280
There you go.

3250
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:39,420
I think I did it.

3251
02:28:45,590 --> 02:28:48,350
Now run him over with the tank.

3252
02:28:54,170 --> 02:28:56,490
If Scrappy-Doo can...

3253
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:11,450
If the whole plot of Velma Season 2 is that Scrappy-Doo bit off people's dicks, then I can shoot somebody in the dick.

3254
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:17,690
Come at me with all you got then!

3255
02:29:18,510 --> 02:29:19,190
Wait!

3256
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:21,250
Stop right there!

3257
02:29:22,270 --> 02:29:22,610
Seriously?

3258
02:29:23,010 --> 02:29:23,290
Wait!

3259
02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:23,570
Wait!

3260
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:24,010
About what?

3261
02:29:24,350 --> 02:29:26,690
Oh, now you care about animals?

3262
02:29:27,310 --> 02:29:29,470
Now you condone animal cruelty?

3263
02:29:30,350 --> 02:29:32,190
Oh, it's like the eggs.

3264
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:34,870
Don't worry.

3265
02:29:35,250 --> 02:29:36,930
Those aren't what we're after.

3266
02:29:38,370 --> 02:29:39,830
He's telling the truth.

3267
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:42,550
We just want my motorcycle back.

3268
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,500
He's like, I can understand.

3269
02:29:58,900 --> 02:30:00,800
He's like, I see.

3270
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:01,500
Okay.

3271
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:09,920
The negotiators.

3272
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:11,980
Wait, I got the wings.

3273
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:16,020
How the fuck did I get the wings if like I didn't kill?

3274
02:30:17,860 --> 02:30:19,020
What do you think about it?

3275
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:21,040
Like that doesn't make sense.

3276
02:30:23,060 --> 02:30:24,280
I didn't get the...

3277
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:27,520
How would I grab a piece of their wing?

3278
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:35,880
They grew ba- Oh yeah, you're right.

3279
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:36,500
They grew back.

3280
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:42,140
Alright,

3281
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:49,680
I think I- Oh, I can level up now.

3282
02:30:49,700 --> 02:30:52,380
Alright, what do I wanna... Okay, what is this?

3283
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:54,480
I wanna max HP.

3284
02:30:56,140 --> 02:30:58,540
And then... Increase potency.

3285
02:30:58,860 --> 02:31:01,260
Raises Beelzebub's attack when...

3286
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:05,380
Increase deployment speed for Beelzebub's specific items.

3287
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:11,520
Boost powers of B- I might as- Oh wait, I don't have enough- Oh, I have two- Oh, I have one more.

3288
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:12,000
Okay.

3289
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:16,040
Maybe the rush.

3290
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:17,360
Oh wait, I already did that.

3291
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:21,620
Oh, I need three for that.

3292
02:31:21,900 --> 02:31:22,100
Oh.

3293
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:24,820
Okay, I'm just gonna save up then.

3294
02:31:26,360 --> 02:31:26,860
Uh...

3295
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:28,380
Detect hidden items.

3296
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:29,500
Okay, we need that.

3297
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:30,900
We need the hidden item shit.

3298
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:33,820
Increase the chance of enemies dropping rare parts.

3299
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:34,380
Hell yeah!

3300
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:36,400
I need more Crocs to ya!

3301
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:39,040
We don't care about the old man.

3302
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:42,960
I need all the loot!

3303
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:43,920
Do you need anything?

3304
02:31:45,320 --> 02:31:45,820
Yeah.

3305
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:47,820
I need...

3306
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:49,180
to make...

3307
02:31:49,180 --> 02:31:50,260
parts, apparently.

3308
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:51,680
For the bike.

3309
02:31:52,700 --> 02:31:54,760
Who the fuck cares about the car?

3310
02:31:56,720 --> 02:31:57,660
Okay, the bike.

3311
02:31:57,760 --> 02:32:00,080
Oh my god, I can put a cannon on the bike?

3312
02:32:00,580 --> 02:32:01,160
Let's go.

3313
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:06,660
Alright, nice and in suspension.

3314
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:08,960
Yeah, I'm not gonna build the car.

3315
02:32:09,340 --> 02:32:11,120
I don't care about the car that much.

3316
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:14,820
Uuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

3317
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:17,640
Can I do this?

3318
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:18,480
Okay, make vehicle.

3319
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:20,800
Okay, motorbike.

3320
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:22,520
Toot.

3321
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:23,480
Boop.

3322
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:24,420
Boop.

3323
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:24,800
Boop.

3324
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:27,140
And then...

3325
02:32:28,180 --> 02:32:28,700
Okay.

3326
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:31,120
Make it.

3327
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:33,800
Wait, do I not have enough money?

3328
02:32:34,520 --> 02:32:36,520
I don't have enough money?!

3329
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:36,900
See you later.

3330
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:40,620
I need to pay you to make your own bike?!

3331
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:44,080
What?!

3332
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:45,260
Okay, I got...

3333
02:32:46,660 --> 02:32:47,700
I'm broke.

3334
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:48,960
I gotta sell something.

3335
02:32:49,180 --> 02:32:49,580
Stop.

3336
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:53,460
Alright, give me a sec.

3337
02:32:53,560 --> 02:32:54,640
I gotta sell something.

3338
02:32:55,100 --> 02:32:57,440
I can't believe I have to pay her!

3339
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:00,560
That's so bullshit!

3340
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,980
Okay, $77.

3341
02:33:03,980 --> 02:33:05,120
I'm just gonna sell this.

3342
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:10,060
Well, I don't know!

3343
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:11,980
I thought I had a lot of money too!

3344
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:17,100
God damn it!

3345
02:33:17,300 --> 02:33:17,440
Jimmy.

3346
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:19,440
This is your own bike!

3347
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:20,860
You should fucking...

3348
02:33:20,860 --> 02:33:22,060
You should...

3349
02:33:22,060 --> 02:33:25,740
Not gonna lie, but she should actually like...

3350
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:26,900
You know...

3351
02:33:27,760 --> 02:33:29,280
Actually help out?

3352
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:31,860
I don't have Raptor's Seal?!

3353
02:33:31,860 --> 02:33:33,840
Bro, you should chip in!

3354
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:35,680
It's your fucking bike!

3355
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:37,420
Like...

3356
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:39,600
It's literally hers!

3357
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:44,420
I have to kill some Raptors real quick, guys.

3358
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:47,420
Like, apparently I don't have Raptors.

3359
02:33:47,420 --> 02:33:49,740
I don't have enough Raptor's Steel to put this together.

3360
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:54,360
How is she gonna get parts without money?

3361
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:57,440
This is so bullshit!

3362
02:33:58,200 --> 02:33:59,940
I have to kill some more...

3363
02:34:01,160 --> 02:34:01,760
Babies!

3364
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:08,620
Oh my god, if I could, I would fucking...

3365
02:34:08,620 --> 02:34:11,560
I would knock out the merchant and then...

3366
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:17,400
I would knock out the merchant and farm his Raptor.

3367
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:20,880
Is that fucked up?

3368
02:34:21,960 --> 02:34:22,580
Goodbye...

3369
02:34:22,580 --> 02:34:24,320
Goodbye, little guy.

3370
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:27,720
I got a question.

3371
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,860
Why can humans eat some plants but not others?

3372
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:34,300
Our bodies can't digest a lot of them.

3373
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:35,400
Oh, it's a green Raptor!

3374
02:34:35,820 --> 02:34:36,560
And then there's others that are downright...

3375
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:37,700
Well, so it goes!

3376
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:40,240
Oh my god, it's like a Meerkat!

3377
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:43,660
All right, I did it.

3378
02:34:43,860 --> 02:34:45,100
No green skill?

3379
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,380
Wait, I don't want the green skill.

3380
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:48,680
I need the red one, right?

3381
02:34:53,660 --> 02:34:55,320
Wait, I need the red one.

3382
02:34:55,700 --> 02:34:58,620
Oh my god, I killed the family for no reason!

3383
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:02,480
It's not even the right raptor!

3384
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:05,380
Where the fuck is the red one?

3385
02:35:10,050 --> 02:35:11,130
Oh, there they are.

3386
02:35:11,350 --> 02:35:12,830
Okay, there's the red ones.

3387
02:35:14,710 --> 02:35:15,210
Alright.

3388
02:35:17,350 --> 02:35:17,770
Alright.

3389
02:35:19,110 --> 02:35:19,530
Alright.

3390
02:35:20,050 --> 02:35:21,090
Oh my god, they're like meerkats.

3391
02:35:21,670 --> 02:35:22,890
Like meerkat raptors.

3392
02:35:28,310 --> 02:35:32,310
They don't... They're all weak to the fucking missiles.

3393
02:35:32,650 --> 02:35:33,810
That's all I need to know.

3394
02:35:38,310 --> 02:35:39,470
That's all I need to know.

3395
02:35:39,490 --> 02:35:41,390
I like how the range for this is so low.

3396
02:35:44,150 --> 02:35:47,010
Alright, this has to be the raptor scale, right?

3397
02:35:47,410 --> 02:35:48,610
The raptor scale?

3398
02:35:49,150 --> 02:35:50,290
There we go.

3399
02:35:50,790 --> 02:35:52,470
Oh my god, finally!

3400
02:35:55,010 --> 02:35:56,170
Okay, we're going back.

3401
02:35:56,410 --> 02:35:57,170
We did it.

3402
02:35:58,710 --> 02:36:00,150
I got the right family.

3403
02:36:05,250 --> 02:36:07,230
We've harvested the right family.

3404
02:36:11,960 --> 02:36:13,020
Do you need any?

3405
02:36:13,020 --> 02:36:15,240
Yes, please make the vehicle.

3406
02:36:15,880 --> 02:36:17,840
We're gonna make your own bike.

3407
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:23,420
Wait, is raptor steel not raptor scale?

3408
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:26,900
Oh my god.

3409
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:30,060
How do I get raptor steel?

3410
02:36:32,820 --> 02:36:35,000
Oh my god.

3411
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:40,640
This fucking sucks.

3412
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:46,360
My literacy got the better of me again.

3413
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:48,700
Do you sell raptor steel?

3414
02:36:48,860 --> 02:36:50,520
You don't even sell raptor steel.

3415
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:51,100
Thank you for coming.

3416
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:55,420
I can't believe it.

3417
02:36:55,460 --> 02:36:56,560
Through a side quest?

3418
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:58,040
Which one?

3419
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:00,440
There's so many.

3420
02:37:02,580 --> 02:37:04,220
Oh my god.

3421
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:07,580
Alright guys, I gotta go fucking do a side quest.

3422
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:12,380
I have to craft it?

3423
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:16,600
Alright, we gotta figure out which side quest was the crafting one.

3424
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:18,500
Um...

3425
02:37:19,420 --> 02:37:20,560
I have...

3426
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:23,020
Okay, is it the commander Ardia?

3427
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:25,160
The da- wait, what?

3428
02:37:25,420 --> 02:37:29,320
Okay, which one is water supply point gifted flowers?

3429
02:37:29,780 --> 02:37:31,120
Which one's our quest?

3430
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,160
Junker market...

3431
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:37,420
Okay, the junk pit.

3432
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:38,360
Is it the junk pit?

3433
02:37:41,160 --> 02:37:42,920
Let's see, can I fast travel this?

3434
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:47,400
I can, thank god.

3435
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:47,900
Okay.

3436
02:37:49,300 --> 02:37:49,780
Uhhh...

3437
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:51,000
Alright, get in here.

3438
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:53,260
It's not that?

3439
02:37:53,620 --> 02:37:54,880
Oh my god.

3440
02:37:58,120 --> 02:37:59,920
Okay, where's my quest log?

3441
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:00,920
Okay, which one?

3442
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:03,480
Alright, these are the quests I completed.

3443
02:38:03,820 --> 02:38:04,300
Alright.

3444
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:07,340
Okay, there's the junk pit.

3445
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:09,440
Okay, I completed these.

3446
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:10,880
Alright.

3447
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:13,840
Oh, guys, I just realized there's not a lot.

3448
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:16,820
I only have one side quest apparently.

3449
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:19,180
Wait, where is this one?

3450
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:21,120
How do I get there?

3451
02:38:22,680 --> 02:38:23,700
How do I get there?

3452
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:26,580
Oh, it's this way.

3453
02:38:27,560 --> 02:38:28,580
Oh, it's this way.

3454
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:29,800
It's this way?

3455
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:33,280
Am I heading the right way?

3456
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:34,820
No, it's this way.

3457
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:36,300
Guys, I got lost again.

3458
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:39,800
Well, I might as well farm these fucking scorpion scales.

3459
02:38:41,740 --> 02:38:45,840
I don't know which one is like the quest for crafting.

3460
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:49,720
What is the crafting quest called?

3461
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:50,440
Chat.

3462
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:54,740
Oh wait, I need to...

3463
02:38:57,220 --> 02:38:57,740
Uhhh...

3464
02:38:57,740 --> 02:38:58,520
I need to swap.

3465
02:38:59,820 --> 02:39:01,180
Okay, and then jump!

3466
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:03,140
What?

3467
02:39:03,300 --> 02:39:05,320
I'm not... I can't jump high enough?

3468
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:07,280
What?

3469
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:07,320
I'm not...

3470
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:07,320
I can't jump high enough?

3471
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:07,720
What's the point?

3472
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:13,500
What's the point of having a bot that's literally for jumping when I can't even jump high enough?

3473
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:15,560
That's actually crazy.

3474
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:17,820
Oh, I need to go to the junker?

3475
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:18,640
Alright.

3476
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:20,340
I'm done with this quest.

3477
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:26,340
No, I can't fast travel because the animals are angry at me!

3478
02:39:29,580 --> 02:39:30,780
What did I do?

3479
02:39:31,080 --> 02:39:33,060
What did I do?

3480
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:37,280
What did I do?

3481
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:38,860
I need to finish this quest first, I guess.

3482
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:44,160
Oh, this has to be the quest.

3483
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:48,300
Are they evil people?

3484
02:39:49,780 --> 02:39:50,900
Oh no, hey Ren!

3485
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:52,940
You wanna talk?

3486
02:39:57,580 --> 02:39:59,140
Oh, you're an NPC.

3487
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:00,040
You don't matter.

3488
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:03,600
They all don't matter.

3489
02:40:04,480 --> 02:40:05,040
Weeeeee!

3490
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:05,980
Oh!

3491
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:07,800
Nice.

3492
02:40:11,740 --> 02:40:12,460
Not nice.

3493
02:40:13,180 --> 02:40:13,900
Not nice.

3494
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:14,440
Not nice.

3495
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:14,980
Not nice.

3496
02:40:14,980 --> 02:40:15,420
Not nice.

3497
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:15,780
Not nice.

3498
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:15,880
Not nice.

3499
02:40:15,920 --> 02:40:16,240
Not nice.

3500
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:17,060
Get in the can.

3501
02:40:17,220 --> 02:40:18,080
Oh, there he goes!

3502
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:19,100
Get in the tank!

3503
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:19,360
Oh!

3504
02:40:20,600 --> 02:40:21,320
So easy!

3505
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:30,790
So fucking easy, guys.

3506
02:40:34,010 --> 02:40:34,890
I'm stuck.

3507
02:40:39,030 --> 02:40:39,150
Oh!

3508
02:40:40,250 --> 02:40:40,690
Ooooooh!

3509
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:45,470
Me?

3510
02:40:45,470 --> 02:40:46,390
Let me get off.

3511
02:40:47,730 --> 02:40:48,410
Oh no.

3512
02:40:50,390 --> 02:40:50,830
Oh!

3513
02:40:50,830 --> 02:40:51,450
Oh no.

3514
02:40:51,970 --> 02:40:52,850
Oh nooooo!

3515
02:40:55,350 --> 02:40:58,130
Guys, we have a little problem.

3516
02:41:00,870 --> 02:41:01,610
Alright, nice.

3517
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:02,370
Okay, we got off.

3518
02:41:02,510 --> 02:41:03,190
Oh, thank god.

3519
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:05,810
I was a little worried.

3520
02:41:06,850 --> 02:41:08,470
Oh, extra armor!

3521
02:41:09,530 --> 02:41:10,090
Ooh!

3522
02:41:10,690 --> 02:41:12,490
B-grade gunpowder!

3523
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:15,230
I forgot the fuel efficiency.

3524
02:41:15,770 --> 02:41:16,930
We don't need that.

3525
02:41:17,870 --> 02:41:19,070
That shit's for losers.

3526
02:41:20,630 --> 02:41:22,050
Did we open that already?

3527
02:41:22,170 --> 02:41:23,110
How do we get out of here?

3528
02:41:27,530 --> 02:41:28,910
Oh, there's stairs!

3529
02:41:29,390 --> 02:41:30,650
I could've used the stairs.

3530
02:41:35,870 --> 02:41:36,470
Nice.

3531
02:41:36,710 --> 02:41:37,310
Yeah.

3532
02:41:39,590 --> 02:41:41,350
I'm assuming we jump this way, right?

3533
02:41:41,690 --> 02:41:42,290
Here we go.

3534
02:41:46,410 --> 02:41:47,790
Here we go.

3535
02:41:49,390 --> 02:41:50,290
This way?

3536
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:51,070
Ooh, rock!

3537
02:41:51,350 --> 02:41:52,710
Okay, we always need more ores.

3538
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:55,690
Ores are good for us.

3539
02:41:58,590 --> 02:42:03,610
I still can't believe I have to fucking make her goddamn bike.

3540
02:42:05,970 --> 02:42:06,550
Boop!

3541
02:42:07,390 --> 02:42:07,970
Boop!

3542
02:42:08,550 --> 02:42:10,170
Is there raptor steel?

3543
02:42:11,470 --> 02:42:15,010
Ma'am, is there any raptor steel I can scavenge?

3544
02:42:16,050 --> 02:42:16,750
Here we go.

3545
02:42:16,910 --> 02:42:17,470
Please!

3546
02:42:19,950 --> 02:42:25,950
Would anyone... I wish there was multiplayer so I can just ask a dragon to trade me some raptor steel.

3547
02:42:29,690 --> 02:42:31,790
That would be the life.

3548
02:42:36,010 --> 02:42:37,290
That's all I want.

3549
02:42:39,590 --> 02:42:40,510
Is it this?

3550
02:42:40,830 --> 02:42:42,650
Oh, raptor steel!

3551
02:42:44,250 --> 02:42:44,810
Finally!

3552
02:42:45,430 --> 02:42:47,570
Who the fuck is Propta?

3553
02:42:50,250 --> 02:42:50,810
Okay.

3554
02:42:51,310 --> 02:42:53,250
That is, we need four, right?

3555
02:42:53,470 --> 02:42:55,290
Oh my god, thank god.

3556
02:42:56,850 --> 02:42:58,530
Now there's a quest here too?

3557
02:43:04,980 --> 02:43:07,320
Can you do me a huge favor and get me something?

3558
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:07,880
Sure.

3559
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:08,400
Huh?

3560
02:43:08,800 --> 02:43:09,700
No way.

3561
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:11,040
Please?

3562
02:43:11,140 --> 02:43:14,060
My boss will kill me if I don't get ten pieces of iron ore.

3563
02:43:14,460 --> 02:43:15,660
Oh, I have ten pieces!

3564
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:18,260
I've tried, I promise.

3565
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:20,360
I was mining for it till just now.

3566
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,360
Then I found a comic someone left behind at the mine.

3567
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:24,460
I have iron ore?

3568
02:43:24,820 --> 02:43:25,780
It was really good.

3569
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:29,480
I completely lost track of the time.

3570
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:31,820
Is the comic really that good?

3571
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:33,660
You like comics?

3572
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:35,800
I'll let you read it if you bring me the ore.

3573
02:43:36,060 --> 02:43:37,600
Oh my god, the comics survived?

3574
02:43:39,020 --> 02:43:41,480
There's no trees anywhere.

3575
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:43,080
Wait, yeah, it's sand.

3576
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:46,660
Oh, alright.

3577
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:47,720
Sure.

3578
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:48,080
Wahoo!

3579
02:43:48,380 --> 02:43:49,380
You're the best!

3580
02:43:49,480 --> 02:43:50,220
Thanks, buddy.

3581
02:43:51,140 --> 02:43:53,340
I already have it, so I might as well.

3582
02:43:53,660 --> 02:43:56,140
Like, I already... Yeah, it's literally here.

3583
02:43:57,800 --> 02:43:59,420
Thanks, you're a lifesaver.

3584
02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:00,860
I did your favor.

3585
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:02,260
Can I see the comic now?

3586
02:44:02,460 --> 02:44:03,280
Yeah, what's the comic?

3587
02:44:03,720 --> 02:44:04,660
Oh yeah, sure.

3588
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:05,920
How good is this?

3589
02:44:06,700 --> 02:44:07,580
How good is the comic?

3590
02:44:07,580 --> 02:44:10,180
I don't even get to see it?

3591
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:12,300
I gave him 10 ore!

3592
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:15,120
Oh, and here's the thing I promised.

3593
02:44:16,580 --> 02:44:17,100
Thanks!

3594
02:44:18,980 --> 02:44:21,200
I can never have too many of these.

3595
02:44:21,460 --> 02:44:23,600
So bring some over if you have any to spare.

3596
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:25,580
I'll repay you, of course.

3597
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:27,580
And stock up on some new comics, too.

3598
02:44:28,380 --> 02:44:31,060
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

3599
02:44:31,140 --> 02:44:33,340
I didn't even... I lost 10 ore.

3600
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:35,260
What did I gain from that?

3601
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:37,580
It just says I lost 10 ore!

3602
02:44:39,380 --> 02:44:39,980
That's it?

3603
02:44:41,180 --> 02:44:42,460
Did I get scammed?

3604
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:43,980
Like...

3605
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:46,660
Have you heard of sad paper?

3606
02:44:46,820 --> 02:44:48,820
And the thank you in the super chat.

3607
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:49,900
Thank you, thank you.

3608
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,140
Yeah, but doesn't that... like, that's like super fucking rough, though.

3609
02:44:53,540 --> 02:44:55,160
I can't believe it.

3610
02:44:55,460 --> 02:44:58,340
He took that... he took that and like, left me.

3611
02:45:00,580 --> 02:45:02,080
Okay, we have the craft.

3612
02:45:02,180 --> 02:45:03,680
Did I have to pay him for the craft?

3613
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:07,340
No, I didn't.

3614
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:08,100
Okay, thank god.

3615
02:45:08,340 --> 02:45:12,220
Okay, I was gonna say, I was gonna be so sad if I had to pay him as well.

3616
02:45:12,360 --> 02:45:13,380
Cause like, I'm already broke.

3617
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:19,960
Alright, I completed the quest, old man.

3618
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:21,080
Now give me your money.

3619
02:45:22,460 --> 02:45:23,160
I'm broke.

3620
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:25,280
This girl's gonna take all my money soon.

3621
02:45:35,720 --> 02:45:37,880
I can't help as far as parts go.

3622
02:45:38,060 --> 02:45:41,480
But I'm sure you'll come across some sooner or later.

3623
02:45:42,530 --> 02:45:47,000
You gain valuable experience in not getting scammed!

3624
02:45:47,380 --> 02:45:49,120
Miracle, thank you in the super chat.

3625
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:50,400
Thank you, thank you.

3626
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:54,880
Cause, will she learn her lesson and not get scammed?

3627
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:57,460
Find out next time, Sandland.

3628
02:45:59,380 --> 02:46:00,660
I'll think about it.

3629
02:46:02,420 --> 02:46:03,040
Alright.

3630
02:46:04,940 --> 02:46:05,800
Here it is.

3631
02:46:07,220 --> 02:46:09,540
Alright, time to make her fucking bike now.

3632
02:46:10,320 --> 02:46:12,180
I should have enough now, right?

3633
02:46:12,760 --> 02:46:13,240
Okay.

3634
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:31,220
My new car.

3635
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:41,840
There we go!

3636
02:46:42,040 --> 02:46:42,880
Good as new!

3637
02:46:44,840 --> 02:46:46,560
No, this is not a dragoon.

3638
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:47,820
This is a straight up scam.

3639
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:50,980
Come on, let's take it for a spin!

3640
02:46:55,420 --> 02:46:56,520
Alright, nice.

3641
02:46:56,980 --> 02:46:58,820
Wow, I got $500!

3642
02:47:00,980 --> 02:47:02,040
Nice, okay.

3643
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:03,960
Alright.

3644
02:47:03,960 --> 02:47:05,360
Now we can...

3645
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:06,720
Now we can leave.

3646
02:47:08,420 --> 02:47:09,940
Oh yeah, I should save the game.

3647
02:47:09,980 --> 02:47:10,580
You're right, guys.

3648
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:12,280
Whoa!

3649
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:12,720
Whoa!

3650
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:14,480
There's a reason why we don't save!

3651
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:15,060
I'm so sorry!

3652
02:47:15,160 --> 02:47:15,540
I'm so sorry!

3653
02:47:15,620 --> 02:47:16,060
I'm so sorry!

3654
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:20,840
I'm sorry, guys!

3655
02:47:25,890 --> 02:47:26,330
Whoa.

3656
02:47:26,330 --> 02:47:27,290
That was crazy.

3657
02:47:27,290 --> 02:47:29,630
Okay, now we go... here?

3658
02:47:30,290 --> 02:47:30,890
Yeah.

3659
02:47:31,750 --> 02:47:32,930
Water supply point.

3660
02:47:35,450 --> 02:47:37,970
Now we can like, ride the water.

3661
02:47:44,130 --> 02:47:48,850
Alright, autopilot, leave vehicle, boost, shoot, aim, reload.

3662
02:47:49,190 --> 02:47:49,970
Oh, I have drift!

3663
02:47:50,750 --> 02:47:52,230
I can drift now, too.

3664
02:47:57,190 --> 02:47:58,590
Oh my god.

3665
02:47:58,590 --> 02:47:58,730
Oh my god!

3666
02:47:59,450 --> 02:48:00,250
Drifting time!

3667
02:48:04,350 --> 02:48:07,390
I am speeding!

3668
02:48:08,430 --> 02:48:10,530
I'm going so fucking fast!

3669
02:48:10,850 --> 02:48:12,770
You don't understand, Grandpa!

3670
02:48:15,330 --> 02:48:16,370
Gas, gas, gas!

3671
02:48:17,710 --> 02:48:18,270
Dang!

3672
02:48:18,390 --> 02:48:19,330
Thank you for the super chat!

3673
02:48:19,450 --> 02:48:21,770
Thank you for the scam recovery, bud!

3674
02:48:23,630 --> 02:48:26,370
Wait, how come he could ride through the sand with his car?

3675
02:48:28,590 --> 02:48:28,790
I'm gonna go up here!

3676
02:48:31,570 --> 02:48:32,130
Alright!

3677
02:48:33,270 --> 02:48:35,190
Are you ready for action, Guppy?

3678
02:48:36,110 --> 02:48:37,690
We're getting that bounty!

3679
02:48:37,810 --> 02:48:39,150
For sure this time!

3680
02:48:39,930 --> 02:48:40,750
Here goes!

3681
02:48:41,170 --> 02:48:43,670
I feel like Guppy eats all the food for these kids.

3682
02:48:45,350 --> 02:48:49,070
Bro, okay, somebody should take the gun away from Guppy.

3683
02:48:49,210 --> 02:48:50,730
Oh, he actually hit!

3684
02:48:51,330 --> 02:48:51,970
Did you get him?

3685
02:48:54,190 --> 02:48:57,370
That's like the first time I saw Guppy hit anything!

3686
02:48:58,590 --> 02:49:02,810
Also, he fucking shot my car that I spent so much money on!

3687
02:49:02,950 --> 02:49:04,250
I'm so mad!

3688
02:49:07,110 --> 02:49:09,010
I just made it!

3689
02:49:09,290 --> 02:49:09,630
I just made it!

3690
02:49:09,770 --> 02:49:10,670
More or less...

3691
02:49:11,450 --> 02:49:13,970
What the heck just happened?

3692
02:49:15,470 --> 02:49:18,610
Those idiots apparently still haven't learned.

3693
02:49:18,810 --> 02:49:20,450
Yoshi, welcome to the tomato farm!

3694
02:49:20,510 --> 02:49:21,090
Welcome, welcome!

3695
02:49:22,390 --> 02:49:22,730
Oh!

3696
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:28,570
Beelzebub's still alive and kicking!

3697
02:49:28,910 --> 02:49:29,190
Beelzebub's still alive and kicking!

3698
02:49:30,530 --> 02:49:31,370
Say what?

3699
02:49:33,870 --> 02:49:34,590
Zua...

3700
02:49:34,590 --> 02:49:36,390
Does he look mad?

3701
02:49:37,970 --> 02:49:38,690
Very.

3702
02:49:39,070 --> 02:49:41,150
He's glaring right at us.

3703
02:49:42,370 --> 02:49:42,730
Uhhh...

3704
02:49:43,090 --> 02:49:43,670
Uhhh...

3705
02:49:44,970 --> 02:49:47,810
You two, take care of my ride.

3706
02:49:49,070 --> 02:49:50,070
And you?

3707
02:49:50,670 --> 02:49:53,750
I'm gonna beat up some old men!

3708
02:49:54,250 --> 02:49:56,350
I'm gonna kick some swimmer butts!

3709
02:49:56,870 --> 02:49:59,170
Yeah, that's the PG way of saying it.

3710
02:50:03,090 --> 02:50:04,730
Get over here!

3711
02:50:05,390 --> 02:50:05,850
Get over here!

3712
02:50:05,850 --> 02:50:07,610
Oh, no you don't!

3713
02:50:10,650 --> 02:50:11,610
Don't worry!

3714
02:50:12,970 --> 02:50:13,990
Don't worry!

3715
02:50:14,170 --> 02:50:14,210
Doki mad!

3716
02:50:15,070 --> 02:50:16,570
It's a fight you'll get!

3717
02:50:18,590 --> 02:50:19,790
Here I go!

3718
02:50:20,790 --> 02:50:24,390
You're up against the biggest, baddest criminals in Sand Land!

3719
02:50:24,690 --> 02:50:26,210
Here I go!

3720
02:50:26,490 --> 02:50:27,850
Oh, wrong guy!

3721
02:50:29,770 --> 02:50:32,550
Wait, I did that much damage?

3722
02:50:33,550 --> 02:50:34,730
Are you serious?

3723
02:50:35,950 --> 02:50:37,930
I like that that much damage?

3724
02:50:38,910 --> 02:50:40,010
Oh, shit!

3725
02:50:40,150 --> 02:50:40,850
That's fucked up!

3726
02:50:41,910 --> 02:50:43,190
Where is he shooting at?

3727
02:50:43,310 --> 02:50:43,930
Oh my god!

3728
02:50:44,050 --> 02:50:45,910
Okay, guys, a guppy needs, like, help.

3729
02:50:48,810 --> 02:50:51,610
At this point, this might be a guppy issue.

3730
02:50:52,110 --> 02:50:52,510
Like...

3731
02:50:55,630 --> 02:50:56,670
Oh, shit!

3732
02:50:56,850 --> 02:50:57,110
Ow.

3733
02:50:57,310 --> 02:50:57,830
Oh, shit!

3734
02:50:57,830 --> 02:50:59,410
Wait, but he does so little damage!

3735
02:50:59,550 --> 02:51:00,310
I'm not scared!

3736
02:51:04,710 --> 02:51:05,030
Whoa!

3737
02:51:05,850 --> 02:51:06,170
Whoa!

3738
02:51:06,350 --> 02:51:07,310
Wait, that did nothing!

3739
02:51:07,910 --> 02:51:08,590
Wait, that's funny.

3740
02:51:08,710 --> 02:51:09,350
That actually did nothing.

3741
02:51:12,290 --> 02:51:13,930
Okay, let's get rid of this child first.

3742
02:51:14,690 --> 02:51:15,010
Okay, let's get rid of this child first.

3743
02:51:15,010 --> 02:51:16,630
I feel like I should just get rid of Swimmer Papa.

3744
02:51:18,670 --> 02:51:18,990
Okay.

3745
02:51:20,390 --> 02:51:21,890
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3746
02:51:22,330 --> 02:51:22,930
Where are you?

3747
02:51:24,110 --> 02:51:25,250
Don't you dare dodge me!

3748
02:51:25,890 --> 02:51:26,490
That's right!

3749
02:51:28,110 --> 02:51:32,750
I'm gonna punch you in the dick because I'm at the perfect height!

3750
02:51:32,950 --> 02:51:33,610
Oh, shit!

3751
02:51:36,050 --> 02:51:40,650
Honestly, I don't think there's any point in, like, beating up the children as well.

3752
02:51:42,450 --> 02:51:43,410
Because, like...

3753
02:51:45,610 --> 02:51:47,130
What the... Wait, he doesn't...

3754
02:51:47,130 --> 02:51:47,710
What?!

3755
02:51:47,710 --> 02:51:49,930
He doesn't even notify me!

3756
02:51:51,010 --> 02:51:51,730
Oh, shit.

3757
02:51:53,330 --> 02:51:54,670
I just need to kill him.

3758
02:51:57,890 --> 02:51:58,630
It's okay.

3759
02:51:58,790 --> 02:51:59,150
Got it.

3760
02:51:59,330 --> 02:52:00,230
Dodge him.

3761
02:52:00,450 --> 02:52:02,210
Oh, I did not dodge him.

3762
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:04,150
Okay, nice.

3763
02:52:04,350 --> 02:52:05,150
Keep dodging.

3764
02:52:05,310 --> 02:52:05,590
Whoop!

3765
02:52:07,510 --> 02:52:08,730
That's fucking right!

3766
02:52:15,010 --> 02:52:15,650
Haha!

3767
02:52:22,850 --> 02:52:24,310
He just runs!

3768
02:52:26,770 --> 02:52:29,250
That awesome is pissed.

3769
02:52:33,890 --> 02:52:34,970
That's for my bike.

3770
02:52:35,130 --> 02:52:36,550
I just spent money on it, too.

3771
02:52:36,970 --> 02:52:38,790
What I do believe in is the old man.

3772
02:52:40,930 --> 02:52:43,510
If he says there's a spring, I bet he's right.

3773
02:52:43,510 --> 02:52:45,410
I met this guy, like, a week ago.

3774
02:52:48,410 --> 02:52:54,050
If, and I mean if you fight it, would you maybe let us swim there, too?

3775
02:52:54,250 --> 02:52:55,890
Oh, that's what I call the swimmer gang!

3776
02:52:56,130 --> 02:52:59,030
I love how on the far left you can see the guppy's ass.

3777
02:53:00,110 --> 02:53:01,770
What a nice view.

3778
02:53:01,970 --> 02:53:02,070
We might call it the Swimmer Gang.

3779
02:53:02,070 --> 02:53:02,290
Swimmers.

3780
02:53:02,730 --> 02:53:05,370
But my sons never got the chance to splash around in a game.

3781
02:53:05,370 --> 02:53:06,610
Guppy is kicked up!

3782
02:53:06,630 --> 02:53:09,610
Somebody noticed it before I did, that's for sure.

3783
02:53:09,990 --> 02:53:10,090
Hahaha!

3784
02:53:11,990 --> 02:53:13,770
Eh, do what you like.

3785
02:53:16,510 --> 02:53:17,550
Just one left!

3786
02:53:18,990 --> 02:53:20,250
Wait, who's the one left?

3787
02:53:20,370 --> 02:53:21,370
Oh, the guy that's running?

3788
02:53:22,350 --> 02:53:23,770
What the fuck!

3789
02:53:24,110 --> 02:53:24,630
Hahaha!

3790
02:53:25,190 --> 02:53:26,390
No choice now.

3791
02:53:28,030 --> 02:53:28,550
Whoa!

3792
02:53:30,850 --> 02:53:31,370
Hahaha!

3793
02:53:31,370 --> 02:53:34,950
It's like, freaking, guys, it's anime Sonic now!

3794
02:53:35,190 --> 02:53:35,630
Hahaha!

3795
02:53:36,870 --> 02:53:37,830
Oh, shit!

3796
02:53:39,010 --> 02:53:39,850
Oh, no!

3797
02:53:41,450 --> 02:53:42,690
It's okay, I dodged!

3798
02:53:43,010 --> 02:53:43,730
No way!

3799
02:53:44,390 --> 02:53:46,710
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

3800
02:53:48,110 --> 02:53:49,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

3801
02:53:49,210 --> 02:53:50,130
What was your 16?

3802
02:53:51,010 --> 02:53:51,810
Okay, nice.

3803
02:53:52,170 --> 02:53:54,990
Why would that be like the right and not the left?

3804
02:53:55,730 --> 02:53:57,670
Like, the way some of this is...

3805
02:53:59,850 --> 02:54:00,890
Sonic 06!

3806
02:54:01,170 --> 02:54:01,690
Sonic 06!

3807
02:54:10,460 --> 02:54:11,440
I'm tripting.

3808
02:54:11,480 --> 02:54:12,300
Why do I even...

3809
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:13,140
Wait, you're right!

3810
02:54:13,220 --> 02:54:14,380
Why do I even need a car?

3811
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:16,400
I'm faster than the car!

3812
02:54:18,420 --> 02:54:20,320
I'm nowhere near where I started.

3813
02:54:24,220 --> 02:54:24,740
Yikes!

3814
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:27,900
Why does he even need a bike?

3815
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,280
I'm clearly faster than the fucking bike!

3816
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:34,020
Sandstorm?

3817
02:54:34,260 --> 02:54:35,580
What lousy timing!

3818
02:54:35,820 --> 02:54:37,020
Gains a new power.

3819
02:54:37,020 --> 02:54:39,400
There's nowhere to hide around here!

3820
02:54:43,640 --> 02:54:45,440
Did we just leave that guy to die?

3821
02:54:46,560 --> 02:54:48,840
I like how we left the fucking...

3822
02:54:49,360 --> 02:54:51,320
the running kid to die.

3823
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:55,020
Like, okay, yeah, and we're like, yep, we caught up with him.

3824
02:54:55,900 --> 02:54:56,380
Anyway...

3825
02:54:58,160 --> 02:54:59,960
There's a huge rocky cliff over there!

3826
02:55:00,160 --> 02:55:00,540
There is?

3827
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:02,040
Let's hurry!

3828
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:02,460
Where?

3829
02:55:03,060 --> 02:55:03,540
Here?

3830
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:06,600
Am I hurrying enough?

3831
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:09,380
Guys, this is the fastest I could go.

3832
02:55:09,440 --> 02:55:10,560
This is...

3833
02:55:13,180 --> 02:55:14,000
Crap!

3834
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:15,580
We're gonna be flying!

3835
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:18,280
I'm going my fastest!

3836
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:20,740
Hurry!

3837
02:55:25,310 --> 02:55:26,720
We did it.

3838
02:55:27,110 --> 02:55:28,820
We did it.

3839
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:35,160
That was close!

3840
02:55:39,980 --> 02:55:41,750
Why is there light from deeper in?

3841
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:44,290
Yeah, is there a secret town there?

3842
02:55:44,830 --> 02:55:45,790
Secret tunnel!

3843
02:55:46,930 --> 02:55:48,050
Secret tunnel!

3844
02:55:50,610 --> 02:55:51,170
What?

3845
02:55:51,810 --> 02:55:52,930
That's the spring!

3846
02:55:55,510 --> 02:55:57,110
Oh my god, there's trees!

3847
02:56:00,750 --> 02:56:01,730
There's a turtle.

3848
02:56:02,410 --> 02:56:03,910
How did he get up there?

3849
02:56:04,090 --> 02:56:05,550
How did that turtle get up there?

3850
02:56:09,390 --> 02:56:13,550
I can't wait to tell the whole world about this one tiny ass lake!

3851
02:56:15,530 --> 02:56:16,050
Yes,

3852
02:56:20,540 --> 02:56:21,220
there we go.

3853
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:26,120
I wonder just how far the prince got off to.

3854
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:30,640
We should have made him take a walkie talkie with him.

3855
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:33,480
Man!

3856
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:36,280
Man!

3857
02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:37,900
Say something, thief!

3858
02:56:37,980 --> 02:56:38,460
I'm not a thief!

3859
02:56:38,940 --> 02:56:40,220
No, that wasn't me.

3860
02:56:40,520 --> 02:56:43,080
That was...

3861
02:56:43,080 --> 02:56:43,800
Hey!

3862
02:56:44,680 --> 02:56:45,320
Old man!

3863
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:48,060
Prince?

3864
02:56:48,160 --> 02:56:49,660
Where are you shouting from?

3865
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:52,780
Hello?

3866
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:55,000
Did you forget about my telepathy?

3867
02:56:56,820 --> 02:56:58,780
Anyway, enough about that.

3868
02:56:59,080 --> 02:57:00,920
Guess where I am right now!

3869
02:57:01,140 --> 02:57:01,700
Where you at?

3870
02:57:02,480 --> 02:57:03,480
I don't know.

3871
02:57:03,560 --> 02:57:03,760
Where?

3872
02:57:06,220 --> 02:57:07,320
The spring!

3873
02:57:07,320 --> 02:57:10,160
I found your legendary spring!

3874
02:57:11,860 --> 02:57:12,920
We did it!

3875
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:14,100
Can it be?

3876
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:16,240
You really made it to the spring?

3877
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:17,220
Yeah!

3878
02:57:18,140 --> 02:57:18,620
What?

3879
02:57:18,780 --> 02:57:21,740
You telling me the word of a fiend's not good enough for ya?

3880
02:57:23,060 --> 02:57:23,620
What?

3881
02:57:23,800 --> 02:57:23,800
You telling me the word of a fiend's not good enough for ya?

3882
02:57:23,800 --> 02:57:23,840
Sorry.

3883
02:57:24,220 --> 02:57:25,820
So, where is it?

3884
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:26,020
Sorry.

3885
02:57:26,020 --> 02:57:26,020
So, where is it?

3886
02:57:27,020 --> 02:57:29,160
It's like inside a rock.

3887
02:57:29,300 --> 02:57:29,800
It's like inside a rock.

3888
02:57:31,240 --> 02:57:32,680
Your mom's house.

3889
02:57:35,900 --> 02:57:36,980
This is Ari.

3890
02:57:37,160 --> 02:57:37,280
This is Ari.

3891
02:57:37,320 --> 02:57:39,160
May I have a moment, sire?

3892
02:57:41,200 --> 02:57:43,260
What is it, General Ari?

3893
02:57:43,720 --> 02:57:46,440
I'm in the middle of a meal right now, you know?

3894
02:57:46,440 --> 02:57:46,680
Whoa!

3895
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:48,420
Wait, he gets second dinner?

3896
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:50,540
You hardly ever contact me to...

3897
02:57:50,540 --> 02:57:51,040
Oh!

3898
02:57:51,340 --> 02:57:53,740
Don't tell me you've gotten rid of Shiva already!

3899
02:57:54,980 --> 02:57:56,380
My apologies, sire.

3900
02:57:56,880 --> 02:57:57,440
See?

3901
02:57:59,740 --> 02:58:02,400
Supreme Commander Zeyu just told me something.

3902
02:58:03,600 --> 02:58:10,420
He said you had personally ordered him to carry out the genocide of the Pichi and the destruction of the tank brigade thirty years ago.

3903
02:58:12,280 --> 02:58:13,440
He what?

3904
02:58:13,780 --> 02:58:17,760
Why would he tell people that explosion was deliberate now of all times?

3905
02:58:19,060 --> 02:58:21,340
Anyway, that is a bold-faced lie.

3906
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:25,560
Zeyu came up with that entire plan all on his own.

3907
02:58:25,740 --> 02:58:26,880
Oh my god!

3908
02:58:27,220 --> 02:58:28,920
You already threw him under the rock!

3909
02:58:29,280 --> 02:58:29,540
I see.

3910
02:58:32,320 --> 02:58:32,900
Yes.

3911
02:58:33,220 --> 02:58:35,540
I am still pursuing Shiva, sire.

3912
02:58:35,880 --> 02:58:36,660
Ari out.

3913
02:58:37,320 --> 02:58:38,980
He's getting bamboozled.

3914
02:58:38,980 --> 02:58:40,120
He's shifting the blame.

3915
02:58:52,220 --> 02:58:55,520
I can't believe it was true this entire time.

3916
02:59:06,090 --> 02:59:10,110
I'm just wondering, has he ever even seen a tree in grass before?

3917
02:59:10,110 --> 02:59:12,790
I can't believe it.

3918
02:59:12,810 --> 02:59:13,850
Like in his lifetime?

3919
02:59:16,230 --> 02:59:17,590
I know, right?

3920
02:59:17,790 --> 02:59:18,690
Aren't you impressed?

3921
02:59:20,290 --> 02:59:22,630
Okay, let's split up and look around.

3922
02:59:23,130 --> 02:59:24,250
Look around for what?

3923
02:59:24,430 --> 02:59:25,210
We found it.

3924
02:59:28,230 --> 02:59:29,610
Wait, where were we?

3925
02:59:29,830 --> 02:59:31,870
Like, this was the whole mission.

3926
02:59:32,010 --> 02:59:33,030
We found it.

3927
02:59:33,130 --> 02:59:33,450
See?

3928
02:59:34,190 --> 02:59:36,010
Can I run on water now?

3929
02:59:36,270 --> 02:59:37,470
Oh my god.

3930
02:59:37,470 --> 02:59:39,850
Wait, this water is like...

3931
02:59:39,850 --> 02:59:40,970
Oh, okay.

3932
02:59:41,090 --> 02:59:41,510
There we go.

3933
02:59:41,630 --> 02:59:42,390
I was gonna say!

3934
02:59:42,850 --> 02:59:45,830
I was like, this is not very deep.

3935
02:59:46,190 --> 02:59:48,890
Like, now I'm gonna contaminate the water.

3936
02:59:52,410 --> 02:59:52,970
Yeah.

3937
02:59:53,190 --> 02:59:53,750
Yeah.

3938
02:59:56,990 --> 02:59:58,570
Don't bathe in the water.

3939
02:59:58,830 --> 02:59:59,310
Don't bathe in the water.

3940
02:59:59,310 --> 03:00:00,970
Just remember when you drink that water.

3941
03:00:01,270 --> 03:00:02,770
Oh, it's the fucking...

3942
03:00:02,770 --> 03:00:03,770
These houses!

3943
03:00:03,770 --> 03:00:05,850
It's the Toriyama houses!

3944
03:00:06,570 --> 03:00:08,370
What the fuck is a monkey?

3945
03:00:11,290 --> 03:00:13,610
Just remember when you drink that water.

3946
03:00:14,090 --> 03:00:14,810
Remember...

3947
03:00:19,130 --> 03:00:21,430
Remember who touched it.

3948
03:00:27,720 --> 03:00:29,260
I gotta go...

3949
03:00:29,260 --> 03:00:30,840
Go the other way.

3950
03:00:30,880 --> 03:00:31,260
Side.

3951
03:00:34,820 --> 03:00:36,240
I go this way.

3952
03:00:39,830 --> 03:00:40,930
Yeah, the water is...

3953
03:00:40,950 --> 03:00:42,310
The water is like tainted with...

3954
03:00:42,310 --> 03:00:42,670
Oh my god!

3955
03:00:42,730 --> 03:00:43,390
The crocs!

3956
03:00:43,430 --> 03:00:43,870
No!

3957
03:00:46,730 --> 03:00:47,770
Oh wait, nice.

3958
03:00:47,970 --> 03:00:49,070
Okay, I can...

3959
03:00:49,790 --> 03:00:50,490
It's okay.

3960
03:00:50,590 --> 03:00:52,990
Some people would drink it if like...

3961
03:00:52,990 --> 03:00:54,970
I don't wanna say it.

3962
03:00:57,810 --> 03:01:00,310
It was touched by feet.

3963
03:01:02,730 --> 03:01:03,350
It's here.

3964
03:01:03,730 --> 03:01:05,110
I mean, there's houses here.

3965
03:01:08,670 --> 03:01:10,510
Wait, are these the Pichis?

3966
03:01:11,870 --> 03:01:12,890
I told you!

3967
03:01:12,930 --> 03:01:14,110
They're like the Namek's...

3968
03:01:14,610 --> 03:01:15,490
From the...

3969
03:01:15,490 --> 03:01:16,010
From...

3970
03:01:16,010 --> 03:01:16,970
From Dragon Ball Z.

3971
03:01:17,290 --> 03:01:19,130
Now I can sell Demon Prince bathwater.

3972
03:01:20,070 --> 03:01:21,310
Thank you for the super chat.

3973
03:01:21,370 --> 03:01:21,630
Thank you.

3974
03:01:22,570 --> 03:01:25,310
Bro, what the fuck?

3975
03:01:25,870 --> 03:01:27,410
Is that supposed to be like...

3976
03:01:27,410 --> 03:01:28,390
The female ones?

3977
03:01:30,230 --> 03:01:31,870
Why do they look like that?

3978
03:01:32,990 --> 03:01:33,470
Yeah.

3979
03:01:34,230 --> 03:01:35,090
Who are you?

3980
03:01:35,110 --> 03:01:35,210
Who are you?

3981
03:01:37,570 --> 03:01:38,910
Get back here!

3982
03:01:39,070 --> 03:01:40,310
They're like evolved versions.

3983
03:01:42,930 --> 03:01:43,450
Like...

3984
03:01:44,490 --> 03:01:46,950
I am the chief of this village.

3985
03:01:47,170 --> 03:01:49,070
This guy looks like he's from Star Trek.

3986
03:01:49,250 --> 03:01:49,710
What is your business here?

3987
03:01:49,910 --> 03:01:52,250
In a thousand years, this is what the...

3988
03:01:52,250 --> 03:01:54,250
This is what they're gonna look like.

3989
03:01:54,490 --> 03:01:56,790
Their ears are gonna fall off.

3990
03:01:57,070 --> 03:01:58,430
Cause they're already bald already.

3991
03:01:58,570 --> 03:01:59,030
Yeah?

3992
03:01:59,310 --> 03:02:00,190
So like...

3993
03:02:00,190 --> 03:02:03,990
In a thousand plus years, their ears are gonna fall off.

3994
03:02:04,110 --> 03:02:04,910
And they're gonna be tiny.

3995
03:02:05,110 --> 03:02:08,170
I was searching for the spring.

3996
03:02:10,010 --> 03:02:11,270
A demon?

3997
03:02:11,510 --> 03:02:12,590
By yourself?

3998
03:02:13,690 --> 03:02:14,330
No.

3999
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:17,640
I came with my friends.

4000
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:18,840
Thief and Rao.

4001
03:02:23,690 --> 03:02:24,330
Rao?

4002
03:02:24,650 --> 03:02:29,670
If what we heard on the radio is correct, Isn't that the name General Shiva goes by now?

4003
03:02:30,290 --> 03:02:30,930
Yeah.

4004
03:02:33,920 --> 03:02:35,500
Then you're saying...

4005
03:02:35,500 --> 03:02:37,540
Shiva's at our doorstep.

4006
03:02:37,960 --> 03:02:39,920
Wait, he's the war criminal!

4007
03:02:40,240 --> 03:02:41,020
They killed him in the war!

4008
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:41,560
He killed his entire family.

4009
03:02:43,480 --> 03:02:45,920
I mean, he still committed it!

4010
03:02:46,140 --> 03:02:46,640
Like...

4011
03:02:46,640 --> 03:02:48,800
That's not gonna exempt him!

4012
03:02:49,420 --> 03:02:50,560
He killed...

4013
03:02:50,560 --> 03:02:53,460
Maybe millions of people!

4014
03:02:53,720 --> 03:02:54,500
Or aliens!

4015
03:03:06,320 --> 03:03:09,380
He did the crime, but not the time.

4016
03:03:09,460 --> 03:03:09,840
Exactly!

4017
03:03:11,100 --> 03:03:12,880
And I have a request.

4018
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:15,820
That's not how you...

4019
03:03:15,820 --> 03:03:18,020
That's how you forgive a war criminal.

4020
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:19,100
All they have to say is...

4021
03:03:19,100 --> 03:03:19,800
I'm sorry.

4022
03:03:21,980 --> 03:03:23,600
You have my gratitude.

4023
03:03:25,820 --> 03:03:26,860
You have my gratitude.

4024
03:03:26,860 --> 03:03:28,100
Need anything from the outside world?

4025
03:03:28,380 --> 03:03:28,420
Need anything from the outside world?

4026
03:03:28,420 --> 03:03:30,800
Bet Rao would be happy to bring it by later.

4027
03:03:32,240 --> 03:03:34,020
Oh, that would help immensely!

4028
03:03:34,640 --> 03:03:36,180
I mean, Vegeta got...

4029
03:03:36,180 --> 03:03:37,580
Oh yeah, because he was hot!

4030
03:03:37,580 --> 03:03:42,920
There's many canned goods, articles of clothing, and shoes as you can get your hands on!

4031
03:03:44,180 --> 03:03:45,240
You got it!

4032
03:03:48,680 --> 03:03:50,820
He had abs too!

4033
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:57,400
Hot people can get away with a lot of things!

4034
03:03:57,660 --> 03:03:58,040
I'm just...

4035
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:02,720
He had murderers!

4036
03:04:05,960 --> 03:04:06,960
Okay, wait.

4037
03:04:06,960 --> 03:04:08,040
Can I rob them?

4038
03:04:08,700 --> 03:04:11,320
Do they have stuff I can steal from them?

4039
03:04:13,140 --> 03:04:13,900
Tourists.

4040
03:04:15,220 --> 03:04:19,060
Can't believe foreigners have made their way here!

4041
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:20,380
Wait, I'm...

4042
03:04:20,740 --> 03:04:22,440
Wouldn't they be the foreigners?

4043
03:04:22,460 --> 03:04:24,320
Because they're literally aliens?

4044
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:26,160
Like...

4045
03:04:26,620 --> 03:04:27,460
I don't...

4046
03:04:27,460 --> 03:04:30,000
Why did he call me the foreigner?

4047
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:31,380
Hello.

4048
03:04:31,900 --> 03:04:32,660
Hello.

4049
03:04:32,660 --> 03:04:32,740
Hello.

4050
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:36,440
They're literally the aliens!

4051
03:04:40,580 --> 03:04:42,160
They're the Pichirais.

4052
03:04:43,040 --> 03:04:44,960
Now they own this now.

4053
03:04:45,260 --> 03:04:46,040
They aren't aliens?

4054
03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:47,880
I thought the Pichirais were the aliens!

4055
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:51,440
Like, this is my home first!

4056
03:04:55,530 --> 03:04:56,790
Let's see this way.

4057
03:04:59,250 --> 03:05:00,630
Oh, there's a chest here!

4058
03:05:02,650 --> 03:05:03,290
Yay!

4059
03:05:05,430 --> 03:05:07,070
They're second generation!

4060
03:05:10,750 --> 03:05:11,870
Okay, that was...

4061
03:05:11,870 --> 03:05:13,930
That was good.

4062
03:05:18,170 --> 03:05:20,250
Rob, thank you for the super chat.

4063
03:05:20,410 --> 03:05:21,350
Thank you, thank you.

4064
03:05:21,450 --> 03:05:25,830
Whenever you do warcrafts, all you do is give them a puffy face and say, I'm sorry.

4065
03:05:26,370 --> 03:05:27,190
What's going on?

4066
03:05:27,210 --> 03:05:28,210
Did you find something?

4067
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:32,480
Yeah.

4068
03:05:33,240 --> 03:05:34,600
Some Pichirais survivors.

4069
03:05:34,820 --> 03:05:35,640
And their kids.

4070
03:05:36,040 --> 03:05:36,520
I'm sorry.

4071
03:05:36,520 --> 03:05:39,460
I told them the truth about what happened 30 years ago.

4072
03:05:40,620 --> 03:05:41,660
They're not from...

4073
03:05:41,660 --> 03:05:42,260
They are!

4074
03:05:42,660 --> 03:05:44,320
They came from under earth!

4075
03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:45,660
That's practically earth!

4076
03:05:46,400 --> 03:05:46,880
Hahaha!

4077
03:05:49,460 --> 03:05:51,600
They weren't wiped out after all.

4078
03:05:52,760 --> 03:05:53,600
Forgive me.

4079
03:05:54,360 --> 03:05:54,880
Prince.

4080
03:05:55,840 --> 03:05:57,860
I have no right to ask this of you.

4081
03:05:58,020 --> 03:06:00,540
But could we just leave this place?

4082
03:06:00,540 --> 03:06:03,060
Look, some of these Pichirais were born on this earth now.

4083
03:06:03,140 --> 03:06:04,520
So they're like second generation Pichirais.

4084
03:06:04,520 --> 03:06:08,140
So it's peace technically from earth now.

4085
03:06:08,600 --> 03:06:13,380
I already told the Pichirais that we'd forget we ever saw this place.

4086
03:06:13,840 --> 03:06:15,660
I should have known you'd say that.

4087
03:06:16,120 --> 03:06:17,720
Out of everyone I've met.

4088
03:06:18,560 --> 03:06:21,840
I've never known anyone with a soul as pure as you are.

4089
03:06:21,840 --> 03:06:23,280
Oh my god, for a demon?

4090
03:06:23,660 --> 03:06:25,380
Is that any way to compliment a fiend?

4091
03:06:25,980 --> 03:06:26,700
Oh right!

4092
03:06:26,940 --> 03:06:28,640
I asked if they wanted anything.

4093
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:32,180
And they said canned food, clothes, and shoes.

4094
03:06:32,880 --> 03:06:33,780
What are they...

4095
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:35,480
Shoes?

4096
03:06:35,480 --> 03:06:36,680
Clothes and shoes for?

4097
03:06:36,800 --> 03:06:41,200
Once this is all over, I'll load up a truck with anything I can get and deliver them here.

4098
03:06:44,990 --> 03:06:47,690
I can't believe we say that to the demon prince!

4099
03:06:50,430 --> 03:06:52,330
So, what do we do now?

4100
03:06:53,710 --> 03:06:55,730
We have to find the king's water source.

4101
03:06:56,370 --> 03:06:58,090
There's something fishy about it.

4102
03:06:58,150 --> 03:06:59,170
I just know it.

4103
03:07:00,770 --> 03:07:02,590
Yeah, it's not gonna be easy.

4104
03:07:02,950 --> 03:07:04,710
We don't even know where it is.

4105
03:07:04,890 --> 03:07:05,970
And it's definitely not a good idea.

4106
03:07:05,970 --> 03:07:06,970
We're definitely gonna be well protected.

4107
03:07:09,050 --> 03:07:10,810
Yeah, what do you need shoes for?

4108
03:07:12,490 --> 03:07:13,690
The radio?

4109
03:07:13,950 --> 03:07:15,470
Who in the world?

4110
03:07:17,410 --> 03:07:20,050
Hey, flip that switch to put it on speaker.

4111
03:07:23,150 --> 03:07:24,750
This is General Laurie.

4112
03:07:25,950 --> 03:07:28,670
I'm just talking to myself.

4113
03:07:28,990 --> 03:07:29,390
Alright?

4114
03:07:32,570 --> 03:07:35,110
It sure would put us in a tough spot.

4115
03:07:35,290 --> 03:07:35,950
But I'm not sure what to do.

4116
03:07:36,870 --> 03:07:41,910
If anyone were to follow the dried up river bed all the way to its southern end...

4117
03:07:41,910 --> 03:07:43,830
That would be pretty bad!

4118
03:07:44,590 --> 03:07:45,710
Oh no!

4119
03:07:46,650 --> 03:07:52,470
If they did, they'd find the army's water source and discover the truth of the terrible secret there.

4120
03:07:52,510 --> 03:07:53,810
So terrible!

4121
03:07:54,730 --> 03:07:58,950
And this would be especially bad timing for that considering...

4122
03:08:00,290 --> 03:08:02,250
But no one's gonna do that, right?

4123
03:08:02,650 --> 03:08:05,950
...working soldiers defending it to take some well deserved benefits.

4124
03:08:06,810 --> 03:08:10,210
Yeah, but no criminal's gonna be listening to this radio, right?

4125
03:08:10,310 --> 03:08:20,570
I could use a break myself after hearing straight from the king that the events of thirty years ago transpired exactly as thief said they did.

4126
03:08:21,250 --> 03:08:22,430
Hell of a shock!

4127
03:08:23,050 --> 03:08:25,130
I nearly burst a blood vessel!

4128
03:08:27,350 --> 03:08:30,730
Now I'm feeling in the mood to talk to myself as well.

4129
03:08:32,310 --> 03:08:35,590
There are still men of honor serving in the royal army.

4130
03:08:35,670 --> 03:08:35,950
I'm not sure what to do.

4131
03:08:35,970 --> 03:08:40,190
I can see more hope for Sandland's future than I have an idea of.

4132
03:08:40,230 --> 03:08:45,430
Wouldn't the main commander, Zeyu, listen in?

4133
03:08:46,030 --> 03:08:46,870
My thanks!

4134
03:08:48,810 --> 03:08:51,070
Then would he post more g- Oh my gosh.

4135
03:08:51,390 --> 03:08:53,670
Don't think about the plot holes too hard, Doki.

4136
03:08:54,010 --> 03:08:55,210
Don't think about it.

4137
03:08:56,450 --> 03:08:59,650
He's well aware that Zeyu will discover what he's done before long.

4138
03:08:59,930 --> 03:09:01,970
And that he will be punished for it.

4139
03:09:02,870 --> 03:09:04,610
But then why did he tell us?

4140
03:09:04,750 --> 03:09:05,950
What does he stand for?

4141
03:09:05,970 --> 03:09:06,370
To gain.

4142
03:09:07,790 --> 03:09:09,370
Perhaps it's in his blood.

4143
03:09:09,390 --> 03:09:09,850
That's a joke, China.

4144
03:09:09,970 --> 03:09:10,490
Scorpius.

4145
03:09:10,510 --> 03:09:12,990
His father was a great man too, after all.

4146
03:09:13,050 --> 03:09:14,170
It just works.

4147
03:09:16,130 --> 03:09:17,310
Oh, it's a queen!

4148
03:09:17,550 --> 03:09:18,410
He disappeared!

4149
03:09:19,330 --> 03:09:19,790
OHH!

4150
03:09:20,670 --> 03:09:22,070
Why is she so mad?

4151
03:09:22,150 --> 03:09:22,710
I don't understand!

4152
03:09:24,730 --> 03:09:26,850
What could she be mad about?

4153
03:09:27,410 --> 03:09:30,650
What could she be mad about?

4154
03:09:30,810 --> 03:09:32,830
I don't understand.

4155
03:09:32,830 --> 03:09:33,950
What did I do?

4156
03:09:34,290 --> 03:09:34,310
I don't understand.

4157
03:09:34,310 --> 03:09:34,310
What did I do?

4158
03:09:37,690 --> 03:09:39,730
What could I have possibly done?

4159
03:09:40,970 --> 03:09:41,910
Okay, we gotta reload.

4160
03:09:43,130 --> 03:09:44,130
I know!

4161
03:09:44,330 --> 03:09:45,010
I know!

4162
03:09:45,850 --> 03:09:48,730
Okay, but look at how tough the exoskeleton is!

4163
03:09:49,190 --> 03:09:52,850
My fucking missiles is like a little love bump, you know?

4164
03:09:53,950 --> 03:09:56,150
It's like a little tap.

4165
03:09:57,190 --> 03:09:59,470
Okay, what the fuck does this raptor wanna do?

4166
03:10:01,450 --> 03:10:03,030
Get out of the fight!

4167
03:10:03,030 --> 03:10:05,170
This doesn't concern you!

4168
03:10:08,690 --> 03:10:10,130
What are you doing?

4169
03:10:10,810 --> 03:10:11,830
There we go.

4170
03:10:11,950 --> 03:10:12,390
Nice.

4171
03:10:12,650 --> 03:10:14,570
Oh my god, get out!

4172
03:10:16,170 --> 03:10:16,970
Nice!

4173
03:10:16,970 --> 03:10:19,150
I got Queen Exoskeleton.

4174
03:10:20,330 --> 03:10:21,930
We gotta go here.

4175
03:10:22,730 --> 03:10:24,430
Real secrets no more.

4176
03:10:25,590 --> 03:10:28,010
Alright, we gotta fast travel Spino.

4177
03:10:28,730 --> 03:10:31,310
He's in the splash zone.

4178
03:10:31,790 --> 03:10:32,930
Wait, why is he...

4179
03:10:33,030 --> 03:10:34,730
Oh yeah, it's just a cat.

4180
03:10:36,110 --> 03:10:37,370
We gotta go this way.

4181
03:10:41,200 --> 03:10:44,780
Guys, how many percentage of the game have I done anyway?

4182
03:10:45,080 --> 03:10:46,880
I feel like not that much.

4183
03:10:50,080 --> 03:10:52,900
Like how much percentage of the story am I in?

4184
03:10:53,640 --> 03:10:54,500
You got it!

4185
03:10:59,700 --> 03:11:00,900
20%?!

4186
03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:03,280
This is 20%?!

4187
03:11:03,280 --> 03:11:04,700
Chapter 13?!

4188
03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:05,620
Wow!

4189
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:12,020
Bro, this already feels like mid-game.

4190
03:11:12,160 --> 03:11:14,760
I feel like... I thought I was like...

4191
03:11:14,760 --> 03:11:19,360
I thought I was like at mid-game with the way the story was going.

4192
03:11:20,360 --> 03:11:21,980
Apparently I wasn't even mid-game.

4193
03:11:22,100 --> 03:11:23,600
I'm chapter 13 of 31.

4194
03:11:24,100 --> 03:11:25,480
We'll probably find traveling merchants on the main roads.

4195
03:11:26,580 --> 03:11:30,380
They roam over Sandland, peddling their wares to all comers.

4196
03:11:30,860 --> 03:11:32,260
Okay, I might need more raptors.

4197
03:11:32,260 --> 03:11:33,100
Travelers, huh?

4198
03:11:33,660 --> 03:11:36,540
If we find any, let's stop and compare notes with them.

4199
03:11:38,660 --> 03:11:40,740
Oh shit, okay, let's kill these guys.

4200
03:11:43,060 --> 03:11:43,540
Alright.

4201
03:11:44,680 --> 03:11:47,280
Okay, we need some other materials.

4202
03:11:48,780 --> 03:11:51,020
What level is my fucking car anyway?

4203
03:11:52,720 --> 03:11:53,200
Okay.

4204
03:11:53,540 --> 03:11:56,220
I mean, it's a good sign that it's like a one-shot though.

4205
03:11:58,360 --> 03:11:59,060
Nice, alright.

4206
03:11:59,600 --> 03:12:01,020
I'll get all these mats.

4207
03:12:01,640 --> 03:12:03,320
Gotta absorb this tank.

4208
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:06,900
And then... we gotta...

4209
03:12:06,900 --> 03:12:10,080
To be fair, I noticed that I am missing like three more cars.

4210
03:12:16,740 --> 03:12:19,240
I need to upgrade my other tank too.

4211
03:12:19,320 --> 03:12:21,240
My better... my better dragoon.

4212
03:12:25,480 --> 03:12:27,520
Or... oh wait, nice ores!

4213
03:12:28,580 --> 03:12:29,900
I love materials.

4214
03:12:30,080 --> 03:12:30,940
I love mats.

4215
03:12:35,590 --> 03:12:36,950
Okay, get over here.

4216
03:12:41,310 --> 03:12:41,790
No!

4217
03:12:46,470 --> 03:12:47,270
At the reload!

4218
03:12:49,830 --> 03:12:50,310
Guys!

4219
03:12:52,270 --> 03:12:54,030
I fucking knew it was a PlayStation!

4220
03:12:55,310 --> 03:12:56,890
That he gave us!

4221
03:12:57,050 --> 03:12:59,050
I was like, that looks so much like a PlayStation!

4222
03:12:59,550 --> 03:13:02,490
It was like, whoa, whoa, you guys were like, no, Doki, it's a Saturn!

4223
03:13:02,490 --> 03:13:10,330
And then I read the first chapter of Sandland, and literally they were like, oh my god, it's a PlayStation!

4224
03:13:10,690 --> 03:13:15,190
But then of course in the game, they had to be like copyright free, so they could...

4225
03:13:15,190 --> 03:13:17,130
I fucking knew it!

4226
03:13:17,230 --> 03:13:18,630
I knew my PlayStations!

4227
03:13:18,710 --> 03:13:21,550
...to be any better in your day than it is now.

4228
03:13:22,550 --> 03:13:23,570
Translation error.

4229
03:13:24,310 --> 03:13:27,350
Knowing what I do now, the rebel army will teach you...

4230
03:13:27,350 --> 03:13:28,570
I fucking knew it!

4231
03:13:28,570 --> 03:13:32,270
You guys gaslit me into thinking it was a Sega Saturn.

4232
03:13:32,270 --> 03:13:35,750
...to believe it was built on a foundation of sand.

4233
03:13:36,950 --> 03:13:38,910
Including what you thought about demons?

4234
03:13:40,370 --> 03:13:42,010
Yeah, that too.

4235
03:13:42,210 --> 03:13:43,450
Wait, can I just jump up?

4236
03:13:43,750 --> 03:13:45,130
You opened my eyes, most of all.

4237
03:13:48,930 --> 03:13:49,570
Weeeeee!

4238
03:13:49,850 --> 03:13:51,130
It's like a slide!

4239
03:13:53,470 --> 03:13:54,110
Weeeeee!

4240
03:13:56,510 --> 03:13:57,150
Weeeeee!

4241
03:13:59,070 --> 03:14:00,570
It's like a little slide!

4242
03:14:01,550 --> 03:14:03,150
Wait, I could just use my bike!

4243
03:14:03,250 --> 03:14:04,170
It's literally faster!

4244
03:14:04,970 --> 03:14:05,970
I'm so stupid!

4245
03:14:11,330 --> 03:14:11,970
There we go.

4246
03:14:12,810 --> 03:14:14,350
I can get there faster now.

4247
03:14:19,570 --> 03:14:20,050
Weeeeee!

4248
03:14:20,070 --> 03:14:23,370
We might be able to reach these inaccessible spots one day.

4249
03:14:25,750 --> 03:14:28,670
Supreme Commander Zayu, we have General Aray on the line!

4250
03:14:30,830 --> 03:14:32,230
Hello, it's me.

4251
03:14:33,190 --> 03:14:33,890
Gimme that!

4252
03:14:34,150 --> 03:14:35,630
Can you hear me, Aray?

4253
03:14:36,930 --> 03:14:40,470
What kind of lies have you been telling to the King, you bastard?

4254
03:14:40,470 --> 03:14:40,890
The truth!

4255
03:14:42,410 --> 03:14:43,750
And what of Jeefa?

4256
03:14:43,990 --> 03:14:45,590
Have you finished him or not?

4257
03:14:45,910 --> 03:14:47,650
Wait, has he not listened to the radio?

4258
03:14:47,990 --> 03:14:52,470
I'd appreciate some confirmation that you haven't completely lost your mind!

4259
03:14:54,730 --> 03:14:55,330
Hello?

4260
03:14:55,330 --> 03:14:55,930
Hello?

4261
03:14:56,770 --> 03:14:59,190
Sorry, it seems reception's bad here.

4262
03:15:00,570 --> 03:15:02,210
Can't hear what you're saying!

4263
03:15:05,190 --> 03:15:09,710
No response from the troops guarding the water source or General Aray!

4264
03:15:10,770 --> 03:15:11,390
What?

4265
03:15:11,990 --> 03:15:12,610
What?

4266
03:15:15,030 --> 03:15:17,750
Dispatch my personal elite guard to the water source!

4267
03:15:17,750 --> 03:15:20,270
Oh, I thought someone was like, that dude's in an iron lung!

4268
03:15:21,070 --> 03:15:21,690
Stop, Jeefa!

4269
03:15:21,690 --> 03:15:21,690
Oh God!

4270
03:15:22,170 --> 03:15:26,310
According to information from the news office...

4271
03:15:27,670 --> 03:15:32,190
Uh, criminal organization attempted to go after the Bouti on Sheeva.

4272
03:15:37,330 --> 03:15:39,250
He's that strong.

4273
03:15:52,190 --> 03:15:52,890
Ashmeer!

4274
03:15:58,930 --> 03:16:01,170
He was pink, not red.

4275
03:16:03,590 --> 03:16:05,290
I can't believe it!

4276
03:16:06,670 --> 03:16:08,410
They miscolored him!

4277
03:16:08,690 --> 03:16:09,850
How dare he!

4278
03:16:16,290 --> 03:16:18,230
The insect men?

4279
03:16:24,010 --> 03:16:25,390
The insect men?

4280
03:16:25,470 --> 03:16:26,310
That's too dangerous!

4281
03:16:26,530 --> 03:16:27,410
They're not yet complete!

4282
03:16:28,450 --> 03:16:29,550
I don't care!

4283
03:16:29,930 --> 03:16:33,690
As long as they can kill Seba and that demon, they're ready enough!

4284
03:16:34,110 --> 03:16:35,430
I like his pink glasses.

4285
03:16:38,250 --> 03:16:39,610
As you wish.

4286
03:16:39,850 --> 03:16:41,370
Oh my god, isn't he gonna look like Cyberman?

4287
03:16:46,220 --> 03:16:47,600
Okay, how far is this?

4288
03:16:47,680 --> 03:16:49,660
Holy shit, that's far!

4289
03:16:50,340 --> 03:16:50,860
Wow!

4290
03:16:53,600 --> 03:16:54,720
Oh my god!

4291
03:16:57,680 --> 03:16:59,160
I wonder what they're gonna look like.

4292
03:16:59,440 --> 03:17:01,040
I wonder what they're gonna look like, the Cybermen.

4293
03:17:08,380 --> 03:17:08,740
Whoa!

4294
03:17:14,600 --> 03:17:15,060
It's okay.

4295
03:17:15,480 --> 03:17:16,360
I'm just gonna...

4296
03:17:17,240 --> 03:17:19,180
Honestly, I'm just gonna skip all this.

4297
03:17:22,920 --> 03:17:24,140
That's way too many people.

4298
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:25,340
I'll just shoot the men.

4299
03:17:28,800 --> 03:17:29,860
Oh shit, I think I reload.

4300
03:17:32,280 --> 03:17:32,680
Oh!

4301
03:17:33,160 --> 03:17:34,020
Don't shoot and drive!

4302
03:17:35,100 --> 03:17:36,100
Don't shoot and drive!

4303
03:17:36,200 --> 03:17:38,760
They always say don't drink and drive, but never don't shoot and drive!

4304
03:17:39,140 --> 03:17:39,340
Oh!

4305
03:17:41,400 --> 03:17:41,800
Alright.

4306
03:17:41,900 --> 03:17:43,100
I can outrun this.

4307
03:17:43,500 --> 03:17:44,820
But the loot... Oh, you're right.

4308
03:17:44,960 --> 03:17:45,840
Okay, you're right, guys.

4309
03:17:45,940 --> 03:17:48,400
You like, convinced me by saying loot.

4310
03:17:48,980 --> 03:17:49,960
Alright, I'm turning back.

4311
03:17:53,220 --> 03:17:53,820
You're right.

4312
03:17:53,820 --> 03:17:55,420
You guys always know.

4313
03:17:56,080 --> 03:17:58,220
You know I can't resist loot, guys.

4314
03:17:58,280 --> 03:17:58,780
You knew.

4315
03:17:59,960 --> 03:18:01,120
I might as well.

4316
03:18:03,040 --> 03:18:03,520
You!

4317
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:07,440
Get over here.

4318
03:18:08,140 --> 03:18:09,100
Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew!

4319
03:18:10,840 --> 03:18:12,060
Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew!

4320
03:18:12,060 --> 03:18:12,080
Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew!

4321
03:18:12,080 --> 03:18:12,780
Get over here.

4322
03:18:12,780 --> 03:18:13,480
I'm gonna run you over.

4323
03:18:15,640 --> 03:18:17,780
Okay, we gotta get rid of him and him too.

4324
03:18:18,560 --> 03:18:19,040
Okay, we gotta get rid of him and him too.

4325
03:18:19,040 --> 03:18:19,220
Alright, nice!

4326
03:18:19,880 --> 03:18:21,060
That should be enough loot.

4327
03:18:21,060 --> 03:18:21,220
Dude.

4328
03:18:23,200 --> 03:18:24,100
No survivors.

4329
03:18:24,620 --> 03:18:26,820
The moment I hear loot, they're all dead.

4330
03:18:32,400 --> 03:18:33,080
It's time.

4331
03:18:34,340 --> 03:18:37,100
Oh my god!

4332
03:18:37,160 --> 03:18:38,740
These guys interrupted my plot!

4333
03:18:38,880 --> 03:18:39,580
My lore!

4334
03:18:39,880 --> 03:18:40,740
How dare they!

4335
03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:43,380
That's so fucked up.

4336
03:18:43,720 --> 03:18:45,460
We gotta get rid of these little guys though.

4337
03:18:46,720 --> 03:18:48,620
And... Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew!

4338
03:18:50,600 --> 03:18:51,080
Okay.

4339
03:18:51,080 --> 03:18:52,340
They're almost dead.

4340
03:18:54,080 --> 03:18:55,160
Come on, dragons!

4341
03:18:55,440 --> 03:18:57,040
You guys can do better than that!

4342
03:18:57,120 --> 03:18:58,280
You used to one-shot people!

4343
03:18:59,080 --> 03:19:01,140
This is why you're not better dragons!

4344
03:19:03,040 --> 03:19:03,560
Okay.

4345
03:19:04,140 --> 03:19:06,440
Just like one tank that's living.

4346
03:19:07,600 --> 03:19:08,340
Alright, nice.

4347
03:19:10,880 --> 03:19:11,400
And...

4348
03:19:12,100 --> 03:19:12,620
Boom.

4349
03:19:13,180 --> 03:19:13,660
Oh!

4350
03:19:13,740 --> 03:19:14,100
Nice!

4351
03:19:14,200 --> 03:19:14,840
We leveled up.

4352
03:19:15,920 --> 03:19:16,760
We did it.

4353
03:19:18,600 --> 03:19:20,040
And then, bike time.

4354
03:19:21,200 --> 03:19:21,560
Yay!

4355
03:19:25,860 --> 03:19:28,200
We didn't see that.

4356
03:19:30,760 --> 03:19:31,120
Alright.

4357
03:19:31,400 --> 03:19:32,600
I wonder how fast we can go.

4358
03:19:32,720 --> 03:19:33,460
We can only go like 98?

4359
03:19:34,400 --> 03:19:34,760
Oh!

4360
03:19:34,840 --> 03:19:35,900
If we go straight...

4361
03:19:36,980 --> 03:19:38,480
If we go straight, it goes up, right?

4362
03:19:39,820 --> 03:19:40,800
What if I can upgrade?

4363
03:19:41,060 --> 03:19:41,740
Do I have enough now?

4364
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:43,660
No, I just need one more.

4365
03:19:43,840 --> 03:19:45,940
What would you do if you ran into a tough enemy?

4366
03:19:46,380 --> 03:19:46,740
What would you do if you ran into a tough enemy?

4367
03:19:46,740 --> 03:19:48,100
Let's see...

4368
03:19:48,100 --> 03:19:51,200
Well, I'd start by observing them carefully.

4369
03:19:52,320 --> 03:19:54,360
Knowing what they can do and what they're...

4370
03:19:54,360 --> 03:19:54,900
Oh, great.

4371
03:19:55,100 --> 03:19:56,400
We're at the southern tip.

4372
03:19:56,660 --> 03:19:58,180
There's no water anywhere.

4373
03:19:58,520 --> 03:19:59,320
Oh my god.

4374
03:19:59,660 --> 03:20:00,320
Maybe so.

4375
03:20:00,360 --> 03:20:00,580
Wait.

4376
03:20:00,700 --> 03:20:04,960
You think like now that I can play like Bandai games, should I play jump?

4377
03:20:10,640 --> 03:20:14,160
The best fighting game out there.

4378
03:20:14,180 --> 03:20:14,740
Yeah.

4379
03:20:14,740 --> 03:20:15,080
Yeah.

4380
03:20:16,040 --> 03:20:18,580
Do these old eyes deceive me?

4381
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:26,980
It's a dam!

4382
03:20:27,740 --> 03:20:28,860
Jump Force.

4383
03:20:28,880 --> 03:20:30,040
You know, Jump Force.

4384
03:20:30,160 --> 03:20:31,200
The greatest...

4385
03:20:31,200 --> 03:20:34,480
The greatest shonen crossover of our time!

4386
03:20:35,180 --> 03:20:36,220
What do you mean?

4387
03:20:36,520 --> 03:20:38,880
We can have Naruto fight Goku!

4388
03:20:42,700 --> 03:20:43,980
There's the...

4389
03:20:43,980 --> 03:20:45,080
There's the...

4390
03:20:51,050 --> 03:20:52,330
How do we get up there?

4391
03:20:54,370 --> 03:20:55,410
Oh, like this way?

4392
03:20:56,530 --> 03:20:57,750
Why is this this way?

4393
03:21:02,730 --> 03:21:03,430
All right.

4394
03:21:03,530 --> 03:21:06,270
And then we go this way.

4395
03:21:06,750 --> 03:21:07,270
Drift.

4396
03:21:08,130 --> 03:21:08,890
My god.

4397
03:21:08,970 --> 03:21:09,870
It takes so long.

4398
03:21:10,130 --> 03:21:10,690
The turn.

4399
03:21:14,810 --> 03:21:15,910
What the fuck?

4400
03:21:16,550 --> 03:21:17,870
How did they get over here?

4401
03:21:18,170 --> 03:21:21,550
Looks like there's something they really don't want us to see.

4402
03:21:21,870 --> 03:21:22,230
Yeah.

4403
03:21:22,790 --> 03:21:23,870
What is the twist?

4404
03:21:23,870 --> 03:21:26,030
There has to be a twist here.

4405
03:21:26,610 --> 03:21:29,610
Well, obviously there is a twist because they don't want us to see.

4406
03:21:30,750 --> 03:21:31,850
But what is it?

4407
03:21:35,700 --> 03:21:36,180
No.

4408
03:21:36,300 --> 03:21:37,300
No, there's like one!

4409
03:21:40,160 --> 03:21:40,640
Nice.

4410
03:21:40,640 --> 03:21:41,040
All right.

4411
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:42,660
And then...

4412
03:21:42,660 --> 03:21:43,520
Absorb.

4413
03:21:49,200 --> 03:21:49,680
Okay.

4414
03:21:53,320 --> 03:21:54,280
Oh, no.

4415
03:21:54,380 --> 03:21:55,820
I have to walk now.

4416
03:21:56,800 --> 03:21:57,760
My legs!

4417
03:21:57,760 --> 03:22:00,340
I have to use my legs!

4418
03:22:01,540 --> 03:22:02,280
All right.

4419
03:22:03,580 --> 03:22:05,180
Time to use my legs.

4420
03:22:08,260 --> 03:22:10,360
Yeah, but there's a deep dark secret.

4421
03:22:10,540 --> 03:22:11,720
What could that be though?

4422
03:22:16,400 --> 03:22:18,520
Yeah, where do we go?

4423
03:22:20,380 --> 03:22:21,060
I'm here!

4424
03:22:22,040 --> 03:22:24,000
Let me drink some water.

4425
03:22:24,240 --> 03:22:25,420
Gotta stay hydrated.

4426
03:22:35,300 --> 03:22:36,600
Yeah, there it is.

4427
03:22:37,040 --> 03:22:37,800
What?

4428
03:22:40,660 --> 03:22:42,000
What the fuck?

4429
03:22:42,380 --> 03:22:43,840
I don't believe it.

4430
03:22:44,240 --> 03:22:47,360
They dammed up the whole river.

4431
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:48,600
Wait.

4432
03:22:48,740 --> 03:22:51,100
So there's water this entire time?

4433
03:22:52,260 --> 03:22:55,680
Then the river didn't dry up on its own.

4434
03:22:56,060 --> 03:22:56,480
Wait.

4435
03:22:56,680 --> 03:22:57,200
Is it...

4436
03:22:57,200 --> 03:23:00,380
Are we like the only country with no water?

4437
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:02,880
That's so fucked up!

4438
03:23:03,420 --> 03:23:05,280
Like the rest of the world is like...

4439
03:23:05,280 --> 03:23:06,360
The world's okay!

4440
03:23:06,920 --> 03:23:08,880
It's just this area!

4441
03:23:09,780 --> 03:23:15,380
I don't understand humans.

4442
03:23:16,260 --> 03:23:18,180
You'd go this far for me.

4443
03:23:18,180 --> 03:23:18,300
Bro!

4444
03:23:18,380 --> 03:23:20,120
That's why there's no planes!

4445
03:23:20,400 --> 03:23:23,280
So they can't fly over and see it!

4446
03:23:23,800 --> 03:23:26,360
It's really just this one area.

4447
03:23:27,720 --> 03:23:32,580
That stupid king is no more than a puppet dancing on Zale's strings.

4448
03:23:34,440 --> 03:23:35,900
So what should we do?

4449
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:36,320
Just this place!

4450
03:23:37,940 --> 03:23:40,380
First, we destroy this dam.

4451
03:23:40,780 --> 03:23:43,360
It's just like Attack on Titan all over again.

4452
03:23:43,660 --> 03:23:46,240
There's a world beyond the Sand Land!

4453
03:23:47,340 --> 03:23:48,320
But you like...

4454
03:23:48,320 --> 03:23:48,860
Okay, like...

4455
03:23:48,860 --> 03:23:49,860
Okay, like there's like...

4456
03:23:49,860 --> 03:23:50,640
Come with us.

4457
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:51,140
Uh...

4458
03:23:51,140 --> 03:23:55,440
Sand Land America is just out there and just being like, bro, what the fuck is going on over there?

4459
03:24:01,340 --> 03:24:02,560
The Sand Land America is just like...

4460
03:24:02,560 --> 03:24:02,980
We're just like...

4461
03:24:02,980 --> 03:24:06,960
Sand Land America is just outside with all the water looking at them and being like, what the fuck is happening?

4462
03:24:16,990 --> 03:24:19,630
Not all lands are sand?!

4463
03:24:22,150 --> 03:24:24,190
Wait, what's this?

4464
03:24:27,790 --> 03:24:29,330
Yeah, Water Land.

4465
03:24:30,430 --> 03:24:33,790
That's where the Sand Land stays in Sand Land.

4466
03:24:35,270 --> 03:24:38,010
Not a lot for words now, are you?

4467
03:24:39,810 --> 03:24:41,530
Just wait right there!

4468
03:24:41,650 --> 03:24:44,150
But Sand Land, not Sand World!

4469
03:24:44,530 --> 03:24:46,890
I promise you that I will make it quick!

4470
03:24:49,550 --> 03:24:50,650
This is bad.

4471
03:24:50,970 --> 03:24:52,190
We'll be picked off.

4472
03:24:53,310 --> 03:24:53,910
Hurry!

4473
03:24:53,990 --> 03:24:55,350
It said to the base.

4474
03:24:55,630 --> 03:24:56,510
I'm heading down!

4475
03:24:59,580 --> 03:25:01,200
Oh my god, I'm going down.

4476
03:25:01,680 --> 03:25:02,980
Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.

4477
03:25:03,820 --> 03:25:04,780
Give me a sec.

4478
03:25:04,780 --> 03:25:07,040
Give me like three seconds to get my car out.

4479
03:25:07,320 --> 03:25:08,140
Here we go.

4480
03:25:09,740 --> 03:25:10,300
Okay.

4481
03:25:10,700 --> 03:25:12,640
I know what's going on behind me.

4482
03:25:12,760 --> 03:25:14,420
I hope my NPC friends are okay.

4483
03:25:19,200 --> 03:25:21,640
Those pesky rats refuse to die.

4484
03:25:22,500 --> 03:25:22,900
Hey!

4485
03:25:25,120 --> 03:25:26,480
Ready the insect man to battle!

4486
03:25:26,480 --> 03:25:27,040
Dr. Pussy?

4487
03:25:28,900 --> 03:25:31,260
Are you really sure about this?

4488
03:25:32,460 --> 03:25:35,280
We still haven't been able to achieve complete control over them.

4489
03:25:36,600 --> 03:25:40,080
Once they defeat the enemy, they may turn on nearby civilians.

4490
03:25:40,260 --> 03:25:41,640
Or for that matter, us.

4491
03:25:43,700 --> 03:25:44,720
Sorry, it's Pussy.

4492
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:50,320
Sorry, it's French for...

4493
03:25:53,580 --> 03:25:54,620
What's that

4494
03:26:02,710 --> 03:26:03,550
round thing?

4495
03:26:04,750 --> 03:26:05,510
Can it be?

4496
03:26:08,550 --> 03:26:09,850
Get it right, Dookie.

4497
03:26:09,930 --> 03:26:10,450
It's French.

4498
03:26:11,890 --> 03:26:13,270
Oh my god, it hovered!

4499
03:26:13,290 --> 03:26:13,350
It hovered!

4500
03:26:14,470 --> 03:26:16,410
It is like the Frieza thing.

4501
03:26:18,130 --> 03:26:20,150
I could say the same to you.

4502
03:26:21,610 --> 03:26:25,650
Then again, you're too power hungry to let even death get in your way.

4503
03:26:28,150 --> 03:26:32,990
Why do you always have to go and cause such trouble, Shiva?

4504
03:26:34,130 --> 03:26:36,430
Why can't you leave things in peace?

4505
03:26:38,510 --> 03:26:39,110
Peace?

4506
03:26:39,310 --> 03:26:39,950
Don't make me laugh.

4507
03:26:39,950 --> 03:26:40,890
It's Make-A-Wish Frieza.

4508
03:26:41,210 --> 03:26:43,330
Is this tyranny what you call it?

4509
03:26:43,330 --> 03:26:46,150
I know everything, Sayu.

4510
03:26:46,290 --> 03:26:48,350
I hope you're prepared for the consequences.

4511
03:26:50,310 --> 03:26:53,970
You should be prepared for the consequences of crossing me!

4512
03:26:54,250 --> 03:26:56,990
You have no idea who you're dealing with!

4513
03:26:58,550 --> 03:26:59,750
Doctor Posey!

4514
03:27:00,010 --> 03:27:00,550
Now!

4515
03:27:05,140 --> 03:27:06,120
What's he gonna do now?

4516
03:27:06,200 --> 03:27:07,120
Oh, it's the Insegmen!

4517
03:27:08,900 --> 03:27:10,360
Frieza from Team U.

4518
03:27:12,540 --> 03:27:14,280
What did he look like?

4519
03:27:14,740 --> 03:27:15,540
What's that?

4520
03:27:24,920 --> 03:27:26,180
Okay, it's not their fault.

4521
03:27:26,280 --> 03:27:27,500
There's no showers in there.

4522
03:27:27,540 --> 03:27:28,800
Look how tiny the pods are.

4523
03:27:29,380 --> 03:27:30,500
It's not their fault.

4524
03:27:33,320 --> 03:27:39,180
Oh my god, this looks like the Cybermen.

4525
03:27:42,600 --> 03:27:43,520
Oh, never mind.

4526
03:27:43,580 --> 03:27:44,600
It does not look like the...

4527
03:27:47,300 --> 03:27:48,440
Never mind.

4528
03:27:48,680 --> 03:27:49,900
It was just the arms.

4529
03:27:56,390 --> 03:27:57,070
Growling.

4530
03:27:59,190 --> 03:28:00,510
It's just a bug.

4531
03:28:11,630 --> 03:28:12,990
One person?

4532
03:28:14,030 --> 03:28:15,050
Oh, demons!

4533
03:28:17,410 --> 03:28:23,830
How can the bugs kill demons?

4534
03:28:29,610 --> 03:28:30,970
How can the bugs kill demons?

4535
03:28:31,290 --> 03:28:33,810
Insect men actually looking like an insect?

4536
03:28:33,930 --> 03:28:34,690
That's crazy.

4537
03:28:35,070 --> 03:28:37,330
We have to sell at home.

4538
03:28:40,210 --> 03:28:42,510
I'm just running over with a fucking car.

4539
03:28:42,850 --> 03:28:44,330
A bug is still a bug.

4540
03:28:45,050 --> 03:28:47,850
I think you guys are forgetting an important fact.

4541
03:28:48,750 --> 03:28:49,910
I'm a fiend.

4542
03:28:51,930 --> 03:28:52,810
Hey, ugly.

4543
03:28:53,010 --> 03:28:55,410
If you wanna run now, I'll let you go.

4544
03:28:55,630 --> 03:28:56,150
Help.

4545
03:28:58,910 --> 03:29:00,270
Oh my god!

4546
03:29:02,290 --> 03:29:06,370
Guys, I don't think he liked that.

4547
03:29:08,790 --> 03:29:09,310
Damn.

4548
03:29:09,310 --> 03:29:10,550
What the fuck?

4549
03:29:11,310 --> 03:29:12,790
You're not so tough.

4550
03:29:13,050 --> 03:29:13,470
What?

4551
03:29:14,530 --> 03:29:15,090
I don't have the guts to be that big!

4552
03:29:15,090 --> 03:29:16,670
Hey, you're right!

4553
03:29:21,110 --> 03:29:23,490
Better be careful, Shiva!

4554
03:29:24,070 --> 03:29:25,370
There's one weakness.

4555
03:29:25,690 --> 03:29:26,830
A fucking punch!

4556
03:29:27,890 --> 03:29:30,930
We'll attack any and every living creature on sight!

4557
03:29:37,100 --> 03:29:38,020
Oh shit!

4558
03:29:38,220 --> 03:29:38,620
My bad.

4559
03:29:40,000 --> 03:29:41,080
What the fuck?

4560
03:29:41,080 --> 03:29:42,180
Put your shirt back on!

4561
03:29:42,420 --> 03:29:43,440
Oh, he never had a shirt.

4562
03:29:43,700 --> 03:29:46,520
God, he looks so much more naked without the cape.

4563
03:29:46,760 --> 03:29:47,140
I'm trying to wait for you guys!

4564
03:29:47,140 --> 03:29:51,340
Makes me... feel so weird.

4565
03:29:51,560 --> 03:29:53,260
It's just... it's just weird.

4566
03:29:57,620 --> 03:29:59,180
Is it

4567
03:30:02,850 --> 03:30:08,030
because he has no nipples?

4568
03:30:08,270 --> 03:30:09,170
Maybe that's why.

4569
03:30:09,170 --> 03:30:10,630
Appreciate it, old man.

4570
03:30:10,770 --> 03:30:12,790
But it's way too dangerous for you.

4571
03:30:12,890 --> 03:30:13,610
Got it?

4572
03:30:13,710 --> 03:30:15,190
Hide in the tank with feet.

4573
03:30:15,930 --> 03:30:16,530
Wee-oh!

4574
03:30:16,810 --> 03:30:17,830
Oh shit!

4575
03:30:18,150 --> 03:30:18,670
Critical!

4576
03:30:19,410 --> 03:30:20,830
Right off the bat?

4577
03:30:24,070 --> 03:30:26,350
Bro, how did you get a critical that fast?

4578
03:30:29,070 --> 03:30:32,010
Guys, I fucked up.

4579
03:30:33,370 --> 03:30:33,890
Guys,

4580
03:30:37,290 --> 03:30:38,290
I learned how to lock in.

4581
03:30:38,390 --> 03:30:39,150
It only took one.

4582
03:30:39,170 --> 03:30:43,450
It only took me like... a couple of playthroughs.

4583
03:30:45,450 --> 03:30:46,410
Jesus Christ!

4584
03:30:47,290 --> 03:30:48,370
Okay, we gotta go.

4585
03:30:48,430 --> 03:30:48,910
Get out of the way.

4586
03:30:53,290 --> 03:30:54,970
You almost got me, bro!

4587
03:30:55,450 --> 03:30:56,190
Oh shit!

4588
03:30:57,310 --> 03:30:59,310
He's like stomping on me like a bug!

4589
03:31:00,030 --> 03:31:01,590
He's treating me like the bug!

4590
03:31:04,310 --> 03:31:07,990
I like how it's just one of them that's taking fucking forever.

4591
03:31:07,990 --> 03:31:10,830
But there's like 20 pods behind us.

4592
03:31:11,070 --> 03:31:11,550
Like...

4593
03:31:15,050 --> 03:31:16,550
That's like the awkward part.

4594
03:31:17,750 --> 03:31:18,730
No, no, no, no, no!

4595
03:31:18,830 --> 03:31:19,530
Oh, okay.

4596
03:31:19,690 --> 03:31:20,530
I was gonna stay outside.

4597
03:31:21,150 --> 03:31:21,630
Missed.

4598
03:31:25,510 --> 03:31:27,790
Like there's literally 20 different pods!

4599
03:31:30,710 --> 03:31:31,610
I did it.

4600
03:31:39,340 --> 03:31:39,820
Oh.

4601
03:31:41,720 --> 03:31:43,560
That other pods are eeky.

4602
03:31:47,630 --> 03:31:48,390
Oh.

4603
03:31:48,530 --> 03:31:49,490
There's more.

4604
03:31:53,220 --> 03:31:53,980
Oh.

4605
03:31:54,060 --> 03:31:55,020
That's awkward.

4606
03:31:56,960 --> 03:31:58,180
Oh, no!

4607
03:31:58,880 --> 03:32:00,180
Oh my god!

4608
03:32:01,440 --> 03:32:03,240
It's not blood, it's just saliva.

4609
03:32:03,720 --> 03:32:07,320
Believe me, you haven't really seen the Prince yet.

4610
03:32:07,640 --> 03:32:08,360
What?

4611
03:32:11,700 --> 03:32:13,980
You demons have been athorne.

4612
03:32:16,460 --> 03:32:21,440
I like how the theme was like don't help him.

4613
03:32:29,240 --> 03:32:35,760
Is he gonna do a super scene?

4614
03:32:44,020 --> 03:32:45,340
I don't know, Steve.

4615
03:32:45,720 --> 03:32:48,080
I'm not getting convinced right now.

4616
03:32:48,240 --> 03:32:48,360
Oh!

4617
03:32:51,680 --> 03:32:52,660
Is this it?

4618
03:33:09,370 --> 03:33:13,530
He's actually go-hot.

4619
03:33:26,070 --> 03:33:27,370
Oh my god.

4620
03:33:30,730 --> 03:33:31,450
Whoa!

4621
03:33:33,710 --> 03:33:35,810
Where the fuck was that?

4622
03:33:39,530 --> 03:33:40,970
Holy shit!

4623
03:33:41,090 --> 03:33:42,550
Now they're just level 10!

4624
03:33:44,490 --> 03:33:46,630
Bro, I don't even need to dodge anymore!

4625
03:33:49,230 --> 03:33:50,590
They're like two hit!

4626
03:33:54,490 --> 03:33:55,070
Holy shit!

4627
03:33:57,110 --> 03:34:00,930
Thousands and millions of dollars of research!

4628
03:34:01,530 --> 03:34:03,990
Dead by one fucking kid!

4629
03:34:05,050 --> 03:34:07,230
By one punch from a child!

4630
03:34:10,110 --> 03:34:11,630
Oh shit!

4631
03:34:14,010 --> 03:34:15,990
Oh no, getting their ass beat.

4632
03:34:16,090 --> 03:34:16,370
That's what.

4633
03:34:17,410 --> 03:34:18,170
Boom!

4634
03:34:20,610 --> 03:34:22,710
He's gotten super sated.

4635
03:34:26,370 --> 03:34:28,870
Dead by one angry little guy.

4636
03:34:29,410 --> 03:34:32,290
Bro, that's like millions of dollars of research right there.

4637
03:34:33,010 --> 03:34:34,490
That's like water money.

4638
03:34:42,330 --> 03:34:44,210
They lost all the water money.

4639
03:35:03,900 --> 03:35:05,220
His hat!

4640
03:35:08,960 --> 03:35:09,060
Oh, I just want to get out of here.

4641
03:35:09,060 --> 03:35:13,380
Can you understand me?

4642
03:35:14,260 --> 03:35:18,260
If you can, then we don't need to do this.

4643
03:35:20,160 --> 03:35:20,720
Goddammit!

4644
03:35:21,880 --> 03:35:27,620
If you can't kill Piazzalbab yourself, just self-destruct and take him with you!

4645
03:35:32,500 --> 03:35:34,860
Don't, thank you for the super chat.

4646
03:35:35,080 --> 03:35:35,500
Thank you.

4647
03:35:35,700 --> 03:35:36,000
Thank you.

4648
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:38,280
You take away the coco villain.

4649
03:35:39,380 --> 03:35:40,800
He's iron lung!

4650
03:35:42,680 --> 03:35:43,900
How would he breathe?

4651
03:35:45,780 --> 03:35:46,740
Guys, he'll be okay.

4652
03:35:46,840 --> 03:35:48,160
Nobody dies in this game.

4653
03:35:54,900 --> 03:35:55,880
He'll be okay.

4654
03:35:56,200 --> 03:35:58,260
That's like just like 80 feet.

4655
03:35:58,940 --> 03:36:00,200
It's not that bad.

4656
03:36:08,300 --> 03:36:09,520
How did he live?

4657
03:36:10,700 --> 03:36:11,860
That thing went...

4658
03:36:14,230 --> 03:36:14,550
What?

4659
03:36:15,590 --> 03:36:17,950
That should have hit his fucking body.

4660
03:36:18,910 --> 03:36:19,470
Sheba!

4661
03:36:24,270 --> 03:36:25,550
I yield!

4662
03:36:25,750 --> 03:36:26,810
I surrender!

4663
03:36:31,280 --> 03:36:33,680
Can't attack an enemy who's already surrendered!

4664
03:36:33,960 --> 03:36:35,060
I'm no threat!

4665
03:36:35,400 --> 03:36:36,800
Commander Zayu...

4666
03:36:36,800 --> 03:36:38,600
He's committed war crimes.

4667
03:36:40,160 --> 03:36:41,960
One more kill would mean nothing.

4668
03:36:42,500 --> 03:36:43,480
Just let me live!

4669
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:48,680
To be fair, he's gonna die of old age like in one next week.

4670
03:36:48,760 --> 03:36:49,260
General Sheba.

4671
03:36:49,940 --> 03:36:51,380
Reporting for my new assignment.

4672
03:36:52,300 --> 03:36:52,700
I'm Alpha.

4673
03:36:53,340 --> 03:36:53,860
General!

4674
03:36:54,400 --> 03:36:57,100
We'll protect our home no matter what it takes!

4675
03:36:58,020 --> 03:36:59,020
I'm a father now.

4676
03:36:59,660 --> 03:37:00,480
Here's my son.

4677
03:37:01,740 --> 03:37:02,580
Isn't he cute?

4678
03:37:05,360 --> 03:37:06,080
You're back!

4679
03:37:06,400 --> 03:37:07,620
Oh, there's Sexy Terrier!

4680
03:37:11,320 --> 03:37:11,840
Oh.

4681
03:37:12,360 --> 03:37:14,200
That was Sexy Terrier.

4682
03:37:16,060 --> 03:37:17,800
For you I have no mercy.

4683
03:37:18,960 --> 03:37:19,680
Do it!

4684
03:37:19,800 --> 03:37:20,400
Pull the trigger!

4685
03:37:25,930 --> 03:37:26,830
Is she dead?

4686
03:37:26,930 --> 03:37:27,030
Is she dead?

4687
03:37:28,750 --> 03:37:29,930
Did he do it?

4688
03:37:33,780 --> 03:37:35,260
Did he actually do it?

4689
03:37:43,830 --> 03:37:44,390
Bro...

4690
03:37:50,330 --> 03:37:51,890
He didn't do it.

4691
03:37:51,910 --> 03:37:53,250
What a fucking little bitch.

4692
03:37:56,830 --> 03:37:59,490
Did your diaper exceed its maximum limit?

4693
03:37:59,610 --> 03:38:00,490
Think about Super Chat.

4694
03:38:05,910 --> 03:38:08,470
You're as indescribable as you used to be, aren't you?

4695
03:38:08,750 --> 03:38:12,950
You should have took the shot!

4696
03:38:22,200 --> 03:38:24,300
Oh, he could jump that high?

4697
03:38:46,960 --> 03:38:49,520
Why do we need a fucking car to jump?

4698
03:39:11,440 --> 03:39:13,080
Oh my god, we did it.

4699
03:39:14,860 --> 03:39:17,160
We're gonna bring back WIDE IN THE SAND!

4700
03:39:21,300 --> 03:39:25,020
The rest of the world must have been like, what the fuck is going on?

4701
03:39:26,800 --> 03:39:28,000
Wait, wouldn't we like drown?

4702
03:39:30,300 --> 03:39:32,420
We should not be standing here.

4703
03:39:33,960 --> 03:39:36,100
I feel like the water is gonna fuck us up.

4704
03:39:38,140 --> 03:39:38,580
What?

4705
03:39:40,180 --> 03:39:41,560
Beelzebub never killed anyone.

4706
03:39:41,760 --> 03:39:41,900
Yeah.

4707
03:39:42,520 --> 03:39:44,260
It'll be okay, it's just the flesh rune.

4708
03:39:44,860 --> 03:39:46,040
Betty, thank you for the Super Chat.

4709
03:39:46,140 --> 03:39:46,320
Thank you.

4710
03:39:46,660 --> 03:39:48,460
How about you try firing at it with your tanks as well?

4711
03:39:51,040 --> 03:39:52,000
Worth a try.

4712
03:39:52,400 --> 03:39:54,660
But I'm not sure that's gonna cut it either.

4713
03:39:56,340 --> 03:39:57,380
Ha ha ha!

4714
03:39:57,760 --> 03:40:03,040
So even the great Shiva himself can't break down a wall this thick!

4715
03:40:06,580 --> 03:40:07,620
The Swimmers!

4716
03:40:08,280 --> 03:40:09,320
The Swimmers!

4717
03:40:10,380 --> 03:40:11,360
Those rats.

4718
03:40:11,880 --> 03:40:13,520
They must have followed us here.

4719
03:40:13,740 --> 03:40:15,160
They must have followed us here.

4720
03:40:16,320 --> 03:40:16,880
What?

4721
03:40:16,980 --> 03:40:18,380
You wanna have another go?

4722
03:40:19,760 --> 03:40:21,300
W-w-wait a minute!

4723
03:40:23,140 --> 03:40:27,240
We just wanted to give you a chance to purchase this here beauty!

4724
03:40:27,460 --> 03:40:28,940
I don't buy the gun!

4725
03:40:29,520 --> 03:40:30,080
Damn.

4726
03:40:30,960 --> 03:40:34,300
Pretty serious ammunition for a bunch of two-bit crooks.

4727
03:40:34,560 --> 03:40:36,580
Bro, you wanna swim, don't you?

4728
03:40:36,720 --> 03:40:38,440
That's to blast your damn to bits!

4729
03:40:38,700 --> 03:40:39,780
I guarantee it!

4730
03:40:40,120 --> 03:40:42,100
How's 30 million zeny sound?

4731
03:40:43,500 --> 03:40:44,920
Bro, we're fucking broke.

4732
03:40:45,880 --> 03:40:46,940
I'm a child.

4733
03:40:47,100 --> 03:40:48,200
How would we have money?

4734
03:40:49,020 --> 03:40:51,300
You seem pretty friendly with the army.

4735
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:54,300
Isn't that just a drop in the bucket to them?

4736
03:40:54,480 --> 03:40:58,000
Bro, they spent everything on those insect men and then I beat the shit out of them.

4737
03:40:59,840 --> 03:41:03,380
Unfortunately, I'm about to be canned for betraying my oath of duty.

4738
03:41:04,700 --> 03:41:09,360
I'm in no position to spare so much as 3000 zeny, let alone 30 million.

4739
03:41:11,080 --> 03:41:11,600
What?

4740
03:41:11,700 --> 03:41:12,000
What?

4741
03:41:12,000 --> 03:41:12,380
Dang!

4742
03:41:13,040 --> 03:41:14,640
There goes my payday!

4743
03:41:15,940 --> 03:41:19,420
But, papa, you said you'd part with those shells for free!

4744
03:41:20,760 --> 03:41:21,360
Idiot!

4745
03:41:21,360 --> 03:41:22,600
Shut your trap!

4746
03:41:25,180 --> 03:41:25,780
Fine.

4747
03:41:25,780 --> 03:41:28,220
Let's just say you guys owe me one.

4748
03:41:30,540 --> 03:41:32,660
Prince, that ammunition is precious.

4749
03:41:32,940 --> 03:41:34,000
Do not miss.

4750
03:41:34,860 --> 03:41:35,460
Wait.

4751
03:41:35,460 --> 03:41:37,040
Do I have to get off?

4752
03:41:37,160 --> 03:41:37,840
I can't get off?

4753
03:41:38,000 --> 03:41:39,240
What if I miss?

4754
03:41:46,580 --> 03:41:47,100
I'm not gonna miss.

4755
03:41:47,100 --> 03:41:47,100
Okay.

4756
03:41:47,280 --> 03:41:48,000
It's fine.

4757
03:41:48,180 --> 03:41:49,680
I can have one.

4758
03:41:51,820 --> 03:41:53,780
There's eight bullets, guys!

4759
03:41:55,860 --> 03:41:59,100
If I miss all eight, then that's something.

4760
03:42:05,180 --> 03:42:06,000
Oh my god.

4761
03:42:06,020 --> 03:42:06,600
I should have seen.

4762
03:42:06,680 --> 03:42:10,220
I wouldn't know what it would have been like if I missed all eight.

4763
03:42:10,720 --> 03:42:14,600
We should have not stood... Why are we like this close to the dam?

4764
03:42:16,180 --> 03:42:16,500
Hehe.

4765
03:42:28,390 --> 03:42:29,930
Shouldn't we have done this before?

4766
03:42:33,790 --> 03:42:36,290
This one country just had no water.

4767
03:42:36,430 --> 03:42:39,210
Everybody else is just like, what the fuck is going on in there?

4768
03:42:42,070 --> 03:42:45,130
We could have said this before we shot the dam!

4769
03:42:45,130 --> 03:42:45,390
Damn!

4770
03:42:49,230 --> 03:42:52,550
Guys, we found fruit the moment.

4771
03:42:52,870 --> 03:42:53,710
Damn!

4772
03:42:58,170 --> 03:42:59,130
Yay!

4773
03:43:15,810 --> 03:43:17,610
No food in my ass, I know, right?

4774
03:43:38,850 --> 03:43:39,250
Wait,

4775
03:43:44,370 --> 03:43:45,990
the king is gonna get away with it!

4776
03:43:48,390 --> 03:43:49,770
How about this?

4777
03:43:50,770 --> 03:43:57,250
Why don't you share half of your own personal fortune with both the citizens of this country and the few remaining Pichi?

4778
03:43:57,450 --> 03:43:57,850
Huh?

4779
03:43:58,590 --> 03:44:06,170
If rumors got out about you being complicit in Zeyu's scheme to cause and profit off the water shortage, that might sully your reputation.

4780
03:44:07,010 --> 03:44:11,950
I would suggest making a serious effort to recapture the hearts of the people unless you want me...

4781
03:44:11,950 --> 03:44:14,510
...to give you an unfortunate slip of the tongue.

4782
03:44:14,630 --> 03:44:15,870
He's gonna blackmail him.

4783
03:44:16,550 --> 03:44:17,630
That would be in the best interest of the people.

4784
03:44:17,650 --> 03:44:20,530
I would suggest that you take the best interest of keeping your reign from coming to a sudden end.

4785
03:44:21,090 --> 03:44:21,670
Uh...

4786
03:44:23,170 --> 03:44:25,630
Yes, of course!

4787
03:44:25,630 --> 03:44:26,850
Get rid of the monarchy!

4788
03:44:27,070 --> 03:44:28,570
Perhaps I will do just that!

4789
03:44:29,770 --> 03:44:30,790
Bravo, sire.

4790
03:44:30,970 --> 03:44:34,790
I would expect nothing less from our esteemed and honorable king of Sandland.

4791
03:44:34,970 --> 03:44:38,690
Because military rule is also... is definitely a better alternative.

4792
03:44:39,250 --> 03:44:39,510
Now that was something!

4793
03:44:39,510 --> 03:44:40,850
I can rest easy knowing that.

4794
03:44:40,850 --> 03:44:43,750
The military will be in your hands instead of Zeyu's.

4795
03:44:44,130 --> 03:44:45,150
Me, commander?

4796
03:44:45,450 --> 03:44:46,550
Don't be absurd.

4797
03:44:46,550 --> 03:44:49,190
I intend to retire from the army.

4798
03:44:51,070 --> 03:44:52,330
Is he gonna retire?

4799
03:44:52,330 --> 03:44:53,030
With what money?

4800
03:44:53,170 --> 03:44:56,050
You literally have like not... he just told us you don't have money anymore.

4801
03:44:56,350 --> 03:44:57,610
You're just another villain.

4802
03:44:59,270 --> 03:45:01,110
You should be the next supreme commander.

4803
03:45:01,770 --> 03:45:02,690
You're joking.

4804
03:45:03,050 --> 03:45:04,930
I'd never join the army again.

4805
03:45:05,330 --> 03:45:07,530
You're the only choice for supreme commander.

4806
03:45:08,450 --> 03:45:10,850
Go make a real king out of our foolish monarch.

4807
03:45:11,150 --> 03:45:13,010
And protect the peace, okay?

4808
03:45:13,430 --> 03:45:13,950
Hm.

4809
03:45:15,310 --> 03:45:15,830
Now...

4810
03:45:15,830 --> 03:45:16,990
Shall we go home?

4811
03:45:17,990 --> 03:45:20,990
We'll have them lend us the tank for a little bit longer.

4812
03:45:21,350 --> 03:45:21,670
Yeah!

4813
03:45:22,010 --> 03:45:22,650
Yeah!

4814
03:45:43,520 --> 03:45:44,160
Free tank!

4815
03:45:53,760 --> 03:45:55,840
So... Zeyu is no more?

4816
03:45:56,100 --> 03:45:57,280
Wait, that's not the end?

4817
03:45:58,480 --> 03:46:00,720
Who the fuck are these people?

4818
03:46:03,620 --> 03:46:05,440
Dispatch our troops at once.

4819
03:46:05,680 --> 03:46:08,220
Remember, secrecy is imperative.

4820
03:46:10,840 --> 03:46:13,060
That's chapter 14 out of 30!

4821
03:46:13,180 --> 03:46:14,100
Guys, it's not over!

4822
03:46:14,540 --> 03:46:14,760
Hahaha!

4823
03:46:19,540 --> 03:46:24,940
What the fuck is this little shithead?

4824
03:46:27,880 --> 03:46:29,660
I already don't like him.

4825
03:46:31,740 --> 03:46:34,520
Oh yeah, this is like the country outside of Sandland.

4826
03:46:34,700 --> 03:46:37,400
Who's like, what the fuck is going on there with no water?

4827
03:46:38,060 --> 03:46:38,580
Like...

4828
03:46:38,580 --> 03:46:42,600
Is it the other way around?

4829
03:46:42,600 --> 03:46:42,640
I need to know its map.

4830
03:46:47,020 --> 03:46:48,060
What above?

4831
03:46:48,060 --> 03:46:48,200
This is the map!

4832
03:46:48,800 --> 03:46:49,900
It's the map!

4833
03:46:51,420 --> 03:46:53,680
That's the map!

4834
03:46:53,680 --> 03:46:56,680
We're in the wrong place.

4835
03:46:56,680 --> 03:46:57,900
We don't have a map yet!

4836
03:46:58,460 --> 03:46:58,720
We don't have a map.

4837
03:46:58,720 --> 03:47:01,340
Alright, alright.

4838
03:47:01,360 --> 03:47:01,880
Okay.

4839
03:47:01,880 --> 03:47:03,580
Apparently, this is not the end guys.

4840
03:47:04,180 --> 03:47:05,980
This is only chapter 14.

4841
03:47:06,240 --> 03:47:09,220
Now we have a whole other country to conquer.

4842
03:47:20,880 --> 03:47:22,840
Wait, then this is not Sand Land anymore.

4843
03:47:24,580 --> 03:47:25,760
It's like just land.

4844
03:47:29,420 --> 03:47:30,420
Land Land.

4845
03:47:39,480 --> 03:47:41,380
Give the credit to the old man.

4846
03:47:42,000 --> 03:47:44,380
The rest of us were just along for the ride.

4847
03:47:47,120 --> 03:47:48,160
Of course.

4848
03:47:50,300 --> 03:47:55,900
Now then, I think it's time we paid our respects to the people who supported us along the way.

4849
03:47:56,060 --> 03:47:57,400
Can I finally use my chairs?

4850
03:47:58,200 --> 03:47:59,200
Off you go then.

4851
03:48:00,080 --> 03:48:01,260
I'll be in the garage.

4852
03:48:04,280 --> 03:48:05,500
Do I get a house?

4853
03:48:07,640 --> 03:48:10,040
Can I finally use my 50 chairs?

4854
03:48:15,280 --> 03:48:16,980
What the fuck is this kid?

4855
03:48:20,900 --> 03:48:22,340
Thank you for the super chat.

4856
03:48:22,400 --> 03:48:22,640
Thank you.

4857
03:48:22,780 --> 03:48:23,140
Thank you.

4858
03:48:35,500 --> 03:48:35,520
I did.

4859
03:48:36,240 --> 03:48:39,420
Seeing all of you made me want to explore the world too.

4860
03:48:39,860 --> 03:48:41,460
That was reckless of you.

4861
03:48:41,560 --> 03:48:42,280
Explore the world.

4862
03:48:42,380 --> 03:48:44,160
That's still like the same area.

4863
03:48:44,260 --> 03:48:49,360
You just walked like a couple of miles and was like world explored.

4864
03:48:49,440 --> 03:48:50,700
I just knew I had to come visit.

4865
03:48:51,060 --> 03:48:54,580
I swear I'll make myself useful.

4866
03:48:55,140 --> 03:48:56,360
Won't you let me stay?

4867
03:48:57,400 --> 03:49:01,380
I mean, I don't really mind but what can you do exactly?

4868
03:49:02,160 --> 03:49:04,960
For starters, I can cook some laundry and clean up the house.

4869
03:49:04,960 --> 03:49:04,980
Whoa!

4870
03:49:05,500 --> 03:49:06,600
He's earning better than Anne.

4871
03:49:10,280 --> 03:49:11,500
Yeah, I was gonna say.

4872
03:49:11,580 --> 03:49:12,800
He's earning better.

4873
03:49:13,220 --> 03:49:15,060
I want that guy instead.

4874
03:49:20,640 --> 03:49:23,440
I wanna see the real dad too.

4875
03:49:25,860 --> 03:49:27,020
He's the peak.

4876
03:49:28,140 --> 03:49:30,960
Bro, he's even good at- We don't need Anne.

4877
03:49:31,360 --> 03:49:32,860
We don't need Anne.

4878
03:49:33,060 --> 03:49:34,620
I'll just have him do everything.

4879
03:49:35,500 --> 03:49:36,940
That's the peachy for you.

4880
03:49:38,120 --> 03:49:40,740
The town will grow now that the water's back.

4881
03:49:41,220 --> 03:49:42,680
They'll need- Better Anne.

4882
03:49:42,720 --> 03:49:43,840
Can I rename him?

4883
03:49:44,860 --> 03:49:47,780
I'll personally ask for your tour to let you stay here.

4884
03:49:49,300 --> 03:49:50,160
Thank you!

4885
03:49:50,180 --> 03:49:51,060
Better Anne.

4886
03:49:51,740 --> 03:49:52,920
Now you just need a place to stay.

4887
03:49:52,920 --> 03:49:53,400
That's your new name now.

4888
03:49:54,860 --> 03:49:56,000
What about here?

4889
03:49:57,840 --> 03:49:58,900
Are you sure?

4890
03:50:00,320 --> 03:50:00,840
Yeah.

4891
03:50:00,840 --> 03:50:02,600
It's too big for me by myself.

4892
03:50:03,340 --> 03:50:04,940
Plus, I wanna see your skills.

4893
03:50:04,940 --> 03:50:07,000
Replace Anne with Green Child.

4894
03:50:07,620 --> 03:50:09,660
By the way, I thought up a way to soup up the jump bot.

4895
03:50:10,140 --> 03:50:10,580
Interested?

4896
03:50:12,060 --> 03:50:12,500
Really?

4897
03:50:12,500 --> 03:50:13,360
Let's do it!

4898
03:50:13,500 --> 03:50:14,800
Wait, what is he gonna do to my jump bot?

4899
03:50:14,820 --> 03:50:15,320
Say no more.

4900
03:50:16,080 --> 03:50:19,460
Well done.

4901
03:50:19,900 --> 03:50:20,880
What did he do?

4902
03:50:21,180 --> 03:50:22,000
Now you can charge your jump to go even higher.

4903
03:50:22,000 --> 03:50:22,860
Oh, I can go higher!

4904
03:50:23,160 --> 03:50:23,440
Nice.

4905
03:50:23,920 --> 03:50:24,360
Whoa!

4906
03:50:25,000 --> 03:50:25,440
Awesome!

4907
03:50:27,420 --> 03:50:29,660
I could do this much in my sleep.

4908
03:50:30,920 --> 03:50:33,440
Gaining arrivals turned her into a show-off.

4909
03:50:34,220 --> 03:50:35,360
Way to go, Anne!

4910
03:50:35,360 --> 03:50:37,180
I need to follow your example.

4911
03:50:38,020 --> 03:50:39,380
Thank you, one and all.

4912
03:50:39,660 --> 03:50:41,480
I promise to pull my weight.

4913
03:50:43,360 --> 03:50:45,060
The jump bot is now more powerful.

4914
03:50:46,440 --> 03:50:47,700
You can jump even higher.

4915
03:50:47,880 --> 03:50:49,360
Make good use to explore new regions.

4916
03:50:49,740 --> 03:50:50,360
Oh, nice!

4917
03:50:51,100 --> 03:50:52,060
Where's Better Anne?

4918
03:50:52,260 --> 03:50:52,420
Alright.

4919
03:50:52,660 --> 03:50:53,820
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

4920
03:50:53,880 --> 03:50:54,380
I'll be right back.

4921
03:50:54,400 --> 03:50:55,420
You can look at Better Anne.

4922
03:52:08,840 --> 03:52:09,240
Ginger!

4923
03:52:09,660 --> 03:52:10,060
Miracle!

4924
03:52:10,300 --> 03:52:10,540
Alan!

4925
03:52:10,820 --> 03:52:11,140
Duck!

4926
03:52:11,280 --> 03:52:11,700
And Cess!

4927
03:52:11,780 --> 03:52:12,660
Thank you for the super chat!

4928
03:52:12,740 --> 03:52:13,580
Thank you, thank you!

4929
03:52:13,700 --> 03:52:15,660
Alright, it's time to upgrade our vehicle.

4930
03:52:15,660 --> 03:52:18,440
Wait, can I just talk to Polack to upgrade my stuff?

4931
03:52:19,860 --> 03:52:21,380
Thank you, one and all!

4932
03:52:22,100 --> 03:52:22,580
No!

4933
03:52:23,260 --> 03:52:26,480
What if I want Better Anne to fix my vehicle?

4934
03:52:27,380 --> 03:52:29,000
I like it more!

4935
03:52:31,740 --> 03:52:32,860
It's not fair!

4936
03:52:34,740 --> 03:52:35,820
Alright, let's see.

4937
03:52:36,060 --> 03:52:38,140
We have the materials to upgrade this.

4938
03:52:38,580 --> 03:52:39,740
And then, might as well.

4939
03:52:40,260 --> 03:52:41,660
Alright, and then...

4940
03:52:43,140 --> 03:52:44,380
I don't have enough mats?

4941
03:52:44,600 --> 03:52:45,640
Oh, I still need the fucking...

4942
03:52:45,660 --> 03:52:46,480
Raptor Steel.

4943
03:52:46,860 --> 03:52:48,880
I always need the Raptor Steel.

4944
03:52:50,060 --> 03:52:51,700
Okay, does it make it faster?

4945
03:52:52,440 --> 03:52:56,440
Okay, actually, I don't need to upgrade my... I'm not gonna upgrade Scam.

4946
03:52:57,400 --> 03:53:02,600
I realize I don't need to upgrade Scam.

4947
03:53:02,860 --> 03:53:04,080
Alright, let's see.

4948
03:53:05,340 --> 03:53:05,860
162...

4949
03:53:09,280 --> 03:53:11,860
28... 28... I can upgrade this, actually.

4950
03:53:12,140 --> 03:53:12,980
No, I cannot.

4951
03:53:12,980 --> 03:53:15,120
I can upgrade this, though.

4952
03:53:16,820 --> 03:53:17,540
Okay, max.

4953
03:53:19,640 --> 03:53:20,980
Uhhh... what about...

4954
03:53:23,420 --> 03:53:24,280
Alright, nice.

4955
03:53:24,380 --> 03:53:25,060
It maxed out.

4956
03:53:25,580 --> 03:53:27,220
Okay, we don't need to upgrade Scam.

4957
03:53:27,400 --> 03:53:28,940
I'll never upgrade Scam.

4958
03:53:32,580 --> 03:53:34,520
I'll never upgrade you.

4959
03:53:34,800 --> 03:53:34,880
See you later!

4960
03:53:34,900 --> 03:53:35,800
Alright, here we go.

4961
03:53:38,800 --> 03:53:41,140
Okay, we gotta go to see the mayor!

4962
03:53:41,400 --> 03:53:42,580
Wait, that's not the mayor.

4963
03:53:42,740 --> 03:53:42,960
Oh, it's the mayor.

4964
03:53:42,960 --> 03:53:45,340
We gotta go... back up here?

4965
03:53:45,720 --> 03:53:46,640
Is the mayor up there?

4966
03:53:50,550 --> 03:53:51,670
He's so fast!

4967
03:53:51,850 --> 03:53:54,690
Yes, but my upgrades don't upgrade the speed, guys!

4968
03:53:54,970 --> 03:53:56,570
It doesn't upgrade the speed!

4969
03:53:57,670 --> 03:54:00,990
It's just attacking HP and we don't need to worry about that.

4970
03:54:01,490 --> 03:54:02,450
Where do I go?

4971
03:54:05,270 --> 03:54:06,850
Where the fuck is the mission?

4972
03:54:07,130 --> 03:54:08,090
Oh, it's here!

4973
03:54:09,370 --> 03:54:10,610
The Demon Village?

4974
03:54:10,770 --> 03:54:11,730
Oh, I have to go back home!

4975
03:54:13,210 --> 03:54:15,470
I have to go back home and be like, I'm back, guys!

4976
03:54:16,530 --> 03:54:17,270
I'm back!

4977
03:54:17,570 --> 03:54:18,430
I did it!

4978
03:54:18,870 --> 03:54:20,470
Welcome home, Prince!

4979
03:54:21,290 --> 03:54:21,810
Guys!

4980
03:54:21,990 --> 03:54:23,030
I got us water!

4981
03:54:25,190 --> 03:54:25,710
Yo!

4982
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:31,920
You better not have been gaming while I was away!

4983
03:54:34,080 --> 03:54:35,440
Of course not!

4984
03:54:36,040 --> 03:54:39,080
We've been waiting patiently for your return this whole time!

4985
03:54:39,520 --> 03:54:39,820
Oh, yeah?

4986
03:54:40,900 --> 03:54:43,060
Upgrade Scam, you coward!

4987
03:54:44,040 --> 03:54:47,180
Bacon, thank you for the Akka Seek Fund!

4988
03:54:47,640 --> 03:54:47,880
Thank you!

4989
03:54:48,020 --> 03:54:48,340
Thank you!

4990
03:54:48,340 --> 03:54:49,500
It's time to get my game on!

4991
03:54:50,120 --> 03:54:54,220
If Scam had a hundred fans, I'm one of them!

4992
03:54:54,360 --> 03:54:58,160
If Scam has zero fans, it's because I'm dead!

4993
03:54:59,560 --> 03:55:00,620
Bacon's number...

4994
03:55:00,620 --> 03:55:02,540
Scam's number one fan!

4995
03:55:02,900 --> 03:55:02,960
Don't you have to report back to the King first?

4996
03:55:05,220 --> 03:55:07,000
Oh, yeah, right.

4997
03:55:08,760 --> 03:55:09,800
I should go back to the King first.

4998
03:55:09,800 --> 03:55:12,780
Go tell everyone back at Apato Village what happened, too.

4999
03:55:14,000 --> 03:55:14,580
Gotcha!

5000
03:55:15,550 --> 03:55:16,840
You think you'll drop by again?

5001
03:55:18,000 --> 03:55:19,880
Sure, once things settle down.

5002
03:55:23,320 --> 03:55:24,820
See you around, then!

5003
03:55:26,550 --> 03:55:27,340
Goodbye, Grandpa.

5004
03:55:31,980 --> 03:55:32,820
Okay, then.

5005
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:34,800
Time to report back to Dad.

5006
03:55:35,100 --> 03:55:35,580
Dad!

5007
03:55:36,020 --> 03:55:37,580
I did it, Dad!

5008
03:55:41,780 --> 03:55:42,360
Papady!

5009
03:55:42,480 --> 03:55:42,760
Papady!

5010
03:55:46,970 --> 03:55:50,610
He's the only remaining Dragon Ball Z character to live... to survive.

5011
03:56:02,970 --> 03:56:04,570
Big Dabura...

5012
03:56:14,790 --> 03:56:20,350
An hour and a half?!

5013
03:56:26,360 --> 03:56:29,260
He's the only one to have lived...

5014
03:56:29,260 --> 03:56:31,280
He outlived...

5015
03:56:31,280 --> 03:56:32,340
Uh...

5016
03:56:33,360 --> 03:56:35,860
He outlived all the other Dragon Ball Z characters.

5017
03:56:38,080 --> 03:56:39,480
He's a cool dad!

5018
03:56:41,000 --> 03:56:43,520
I get to play 30 minutes more!

5019
03:56:44,860 --> 03:56:47,680
Well, maybe I'm being too hasty.

5020
03:56:48,100 --> 03:56:52,380
Perhaps I should give these human games a try before I judge them.

5021
03:57:01,540 --> 03:57:02,220
Yay!

5022
03:57:06,440 --> 03:57:07,800
I got...

5023
03:57:09,800 --> 03:57:10,920
I got...

5024
03:57:10,920 --> 03:57:12,240
I got...

5025
03:57:12,240 --> 03:57:12,480
Game time!

5026
03:57:13,020 --> 03:57:13,760
Wait, he's back?

5027
03:57:14,140 --> 03:57:14,720
What the fuck?

5028
03:57:14,900 --> 03:57:15,560
Why is he back?

5029
03:57:16,000 --> 03:57:16,980
Wait, I did my job.

5030
03:57:17,380 --> 03:57:18,660
I did my job.

5031
03:57:18,760 --> 03:57:19,900
Oh my god!

5032
03:57:19,920 --> 03:57:21,580
Am I gonna get two PlayStations?

5033
03:57:22,000 --> 03:57:22,140
Oh my god!

5034
03:57:22,140 --> 03:57:22,140
Am I gonna get two PlayStations?

5035
03:57:22,140 --> 03:57:23,540
These supplies are for them.

5036
03:57:24,320 --> 03:57:25,160
Wanna come?

5037
03:57:25,460 --> 03:57:25,800
Yeah!

5038
03:57:27,460 --> 03:57:28,420
You bet!

5039
03:57:28,740 --> 03:57:29,380
Yeah, I do!

5040
03:57:29,840 --> 03:57:29,960
You bet!

5041
03:57:30,240 --> 03:57:31,700
Aw, shucks.

5042
03:57:32,100 --> 03:57:34,020
I guess I'll tag along, too.

5043
03:57:34,340 --> 03:57:35,660
Now for Season 2.

5044
03:57:35,940 --> 03:57:36,400
Now for Season 2.

5045
03:57:37,220 --> 03:57:37,780
Now for Season 2.

5046
03:57:38,340 --> 03:57:39,220
Oh, that's right.

5047
03:57:39,340 --> 03:57:40,520
I've got a present for you.

5048
03:57:40,540 --> 03:57:40,780
For me?

5049
03:57:41,920 --> 03:57:45,840
Got this bot part as a peace offering from those little punks who wrecked my car.

5050
03:57:46,420 --> 03:57:47,440
Figured you'd like it.

5051
03:57:49,540 --> 03:57:49,980
Nice!

5052
03:57:50,260 --> 03:57:50,700
Thanks!

5053
03:57:52,920 --> 03:57:54,440
It's gonna be a long drive.

5054
03:57:54,900 --> 03:57:56,720
Let's make a pit stop at Spino.

5055
03:57:57,620 --> 03:57:58,260
Sounds good!

5056
03:58:01,020 --> 03:58:01,460
Oh.

5057
03:58:01,940 --> 03:58:03,000
Hey, old man.

5058
03:58:03,300 --> 03:58:04,080
What you been...

5059
03:58:04,080 --> 03:58:05,720
Oh, we're gonna make a pit stop?

5060
03:58:05,960 --> 03:58:06,600
Let me...

5061
03:58:06,600 --> 03:58:08,980
Oh my gosh, it's such a long drive.

5062
03:58:12,040 --> 03:58:13,580
Sorry, I skipped your lore.

5063
03:58:36,600 --> 03:58:37,120
We're going to need to do one thing ahead of us.

5064
03:58:38,340 --> 03:58:40,880
Make sure there's nothing left you need to do first.

5065
03:58:41,240 --> 03:58:41,900
Oh, shit!

5066
03:58:42,560 --> 03:58:43,860
That means like...

5067
03:58:44,460 --> 03:58:44,940
Uh...

5068
03:58:44,940 --> 03:58:47,280
This is like the last time we're going to be here?

5069
03:58:47,460 --> 03:58:48,120
Question mark?

5070
03:58:49,240 --> 03:58:50,060
Is that it?

5071
03:58:50,380 --> 03:58:51,480
Is that why you said that?

5072
03:58:52,620 --> 03:58:53,100
Damn.

5073
03:58:53,460 --> 03:58:54,420
Alright, I'm sorry.

5074
03:58:54,600 --> 03:58:55,460
I need to...

5075
03:58:55,460 --> 03:58:56,940
I do things for money.

5076
03:58:57,240 --> 03:58:58,680
You... You'd understand, right?

5077
03:58:58,800 --> 03:59:00,480
And you do things for money, too.

5078
03:59:01,320 --> 03:59:02,760
Alright, where is...

5079
03:59:02,760 --> 03:59:04,820
Where is Scam upgrade vehicle?

5080
03:59:06,280 --> 03:59:09,000
The one time I upgrade SCAM.

5081
03:59:09,400 --> 03:59:11,280
Oh my god, it's Crocs.

5082
03:59:11,340 --> 03:59:13,280
Bro, I have to use my Crocs, dear?

5083
03:59:21,040 --> 03:59:23,820
I skipped the important lore.

5084
03:59:25,620 --> 03:59:30,860
Guys, can you guys give me a quick wiki dump of what the lore was?

5085
03:59:30,860 --> 03:59:31,580
Ready to head out?

5086
03:59:33,520 --> 03:59:34,380
Yeah, I'm ready.

5087
03:59:34,520 --> 03:59:35,580
I think I did everything.

5088
03:59:37,760 --> 03:59:38,880
I got blue upgrades?

5089
03:59:39,000 --> 03:59:39,400
Not yet.

5090
03:59:39,800 --> 03:59:41,060
I got upgrades, apparently.

5091
03:59:41,400 --> 03:59:42,240
Not yet, guys.

5092
03:59:43,140 --> 03:59:44,780
Wait, can I- do I have it here?

5093
03:59:47,480 --> 03:59:49,000
I already got that.

5094
03:59:51,740 --> 03:59:52,700
Extra armor!

5095
03:59:54,800 --> 03:59:56,620
Wait, I'd rather have extra armor.

5096
03:59:56,960 --> 03:59:57,880
What the fuck?

5097
03:59:58,580 --> 03:59:59,980
What better dragoons?

5098
04:00:01,000 --> 04:00:01,860
You're already good.

5099
04:00:01,920 --> 04:00:03,300
You don't need anything, apparently.

5100
04:00:06,940 --> 04:00:07,880
Shotgun, grenade.

5101
04:00:13,860 --> 04:00:14,800
Okay, nice.

5102
04:00:15,900 --> 04:00:16,800
Quest in the mail?

5103
04:00:16,860 --> 04:00:19,320
No, that's just... that's just Miao Jin Bu.

5104
04:00:21,320 --> 04:00:22,740
I mean, I could talk to him.

5105
04:00:26,260 --> 04:00:29,420
I don't think I'm gonna be doing anything, but I could talk to him.

5106
04:00:38,300 --> 04:00:39,540
Oh, shit!

5107
04:00:39,760 --> 04:00:40,540
Raptor steel!

5108
04:00:40,660 --> 04:00:41,220
I need that!

5109
04:00:41,540 --> 04:00:43,680
Wait, he actually gives me stuff?

5110
04:00:44,580 --> 04:00:46,540
God, we don't need treasure.

5111
04:00:47,540 --> 04:00:51,240
I don't wanna fucking... I haven't found any ruins.

5112
04:00:57,960 --> 04:00:58,580
Alright.

5113
04:01:00,980 --> 04:01:01,840
I'm ready.

5114
04:01:02,040 --> 04:01:03,160
I'm ready to go.

5115
04:01:03,720 --> 04:01:04,340
Yeah.

5116
04:01:04,620 --> 04:01:05,240
Yep!

5117
04:01:05,460 --> 04:01:06,340
All good!

5118
04:01:07,160 --> 04:01:08,540
Let's hit the road then.

5119
04:01:09,880 --> 04:01:10,560
Yeah!

5120
04:01:12,000 --> 04:01:16,880
Have you been back to see the Peachy at all since we busted the dam?

5121
04:01:18,020 --> 04:01:21,940
I've still got enough sex to have to venture south alone.

5122
04:01:23,380 --> 04:01:24,060
Alright, I'll give them lore before I fast travel.

5123
04:01:24,060 --> 04:01:24,440
You guys done?

5124
04:01:24,760 --> 04:01:25,260
Alright.

5125
04:01:25,580 --> 04:01:26,480
Where is it?

5126
04:01:30,380 --> 04:01:31,060
Yeah!

5127
04:01:31,060 --> 04:01:32,080
Fast travel!

5128
04:01:35,140 --> 04:01:36,480
We did it!

5129
04:01:38,160 --> 04:01:41,300
I wonder if the Peachy could make me a new game console if I asked.

5130
04:01:42,340 --> 04:01:46,980
You'd be lucky to get off with cleaning the whole village if King Lucifer found out about that.

5131
04:01:47,760 --> 04:01:48,700
Hello, Elder.

5132
04:01:48,800 --> 04:01:49,260
Oh, well.

5133
04:01:49,580 --> 04:01:51,360
What brings you here today?

5134
04:01:52,160 --> 04:01:55,480
It's not much, but we've brought some provisions for the village.

5135
04:01:55,660 --> 04:01:56,280
I did it!

5136
04:01:56,900 --> 04:02:00,360
Oh, that is extremely kind of you.

5137
04:02:00,580 --> 04:02:01,100
Of course!

5138
04:02:01,320 --> 04:02:02,000
I'm a kind person.

5139
04:02:02,000 --> 04:02:05,180
It's the least I could do to attempt to atone for my crimes.

5140
04:02:05,480 --> 04:02:08,200
If there's anything else you need, just ask.

5141
04:02:09,120 --> 04:02:10,700
I'll keep it in mind.

5142
04:02:11,080 --> 04:02:13,540
But let me give you something in return.

5143
04:02:13,880 --> 04:02:13,960
Whoa!

5144
04:02:14,620 --> 04:02:15,520
An exchange?

5145
04:02:16,180 --> 04:02:18,340
Maybe this would be of some use to you.

5146
04:02:19,180 --> 04:02:20,000
Watch this.

5147
04:02:20,380 --> 04:02:21,280
A gun?

5148
04:02:23,100 --> 04:02:25,720
What the fuck is this guy doing with a gun?

5149
04:02:26,360 --> 04:02:28,120
Yes, designed for self-defense.

5150
04:02:28,520 --> 04:02:30,180
We've covered up how-to.

5151
04:02:30,280 --> 04:02:30,620
Oh, I see.

5152
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:32,620
A gun!

5153
04:02:33,180 --> 04:02:34,620
It's completely non-lethal.

5154
04:02:34,620 --> 04:02:35,740
Non-lethal?

5155
04:02:35,740 --> 04:02:38,060
However, it can temporarily stun enemies.

5156
04:02:38,420 --> 04:02:41,200
Bro, what am I gonna do with a non-lethal gun?

5157
04:02:41,860 --> 04:02:42,480
Really?

5158
04:02:42,860 --> 04:02:44,520
That does sound handy.

5159
04:02:44,740 --> 04:02:45,160
Bro.

5160
04:02:46,040 --> 04:02:49,880
Quite the peaceful solution to conflict, wouldn't you say?

5161
04:02:50,600 --> 04:02:51,720
Peaceful solution?

5162
04:02:51,980 --> 04:02:52,960
A gun?

5163
04:02:53,220 --> 04:02:54,080
It's okay.

5164
04:02:54,080 --> 04:02:54,780
It's non-lethal.

5165
04:02:55,220 --> 04:02:56,520
It's just a taser.

5166
04:03:00,830 --> 04:03:02,530
It's a good gun, guys.

5167
04:03:02,530 --> 04:03:03,250
The sheriff?

5168
04:03:03,370 --> 04:03:05,990
I'm sure you can make good use of it.

5169
04:03:06,910 --> 04:03:07,390
Definitely.

5170
04:03:07,730 --> 04:03:08,470
Thank you.

5171
04:03:09,370 --> 04:03:11,410
Well, we best be on our way.

5172
04:03:12,290 --> 04:03:13,830
Can't you stay a little longer?

5173
04:03:14,170 --> 04:03:15,750
We've much to catch up on.

5174
04:03:16,090 --> 04:03:19,410
Let me tell you about all the people that survived from your murders.

5175
04:03:21,330 --> 04:03:23,650
I suppose we don't have to leave right away.

5176
04:03:24,790 --> 04:03:29,870
You wanna hang out with all the people you fucking traumatized for the rest of their lives?

5177
04:03:32,890 --> 04:03:33,290
Yay!

5178
04:03:34,130 --> 04:03:35,490
We might as well go to the radio tower.

5179
04:03:35,690 --> 04:03:37,790
I realize we haven't done anything with the radio tower over there.

5180
04:03:41,820 --> 04:03:44,160
Alright, let's head to the radio tower.

5181
04:03:45,160 --> 04:03:46,120
And then we'll talk.

5182
04:03:46,200 --> 04:03:46,800
Hello, monkeys!

5183
04:03:47,700 --> 04:03:49,240
Oh, I can't punch when I'm running.

5184
04:03:51,900 --> 04:03:53,960
How do we get to the radio tower up top?

5185
04:03:55,140 --> 04:03:55,920
Oh my god.

5186
04:03:56,120 --> 04:03:56,860
Let me in!

5187
04:04:02,020 --> 04:04:02,660
Let me in.

5188
04:04:02,780 --> 04:04:03,160
Oh, okay.

5189
04:04:03,220 --> 04:04:03,940
I can just go in.

5190
04:04:04,040 --> 04:04:04,440
Nice.

5191
04:04:04,440 --> 04:04:04,700
Oh, okay.

5192
04:04:04,700 --> 04:04:04,700
I can just go in.

5193
04:04:04,700 --> 04:04:04,700
Nice.

5194
04:04:05,280 --> 04:04:06,060
Yeah, we can.

5195
04:04:06,200 --> 04:04:07,660
We have so much materials.

5196
04:04:19,040 --> 04:04:19,540
Alright.

5197
04:04:19,700 --> 04:04:21,260
And then we'll steal their loot.

5198
04:04:22,720 --> 04:04:23,220
Yay!

5199
04:04:25,360 --> 04:04:26,960
Alright, let's talk to this person.

5200
04:04:42,370 --> 04:04:43,370
I can?

5201
04:04:43,670 --> 04:04:44,350
What is it?

5202
04:04:45,710 --> 04:04:46,830
What the fuck is that?

5203
04:04:48,670 --> 04:04:49,670
Is it food?

5204
04:04:59,240 --> 04:04:59,860
I'm not scared of food, is that it?

5205
04:04:59,860 --> 04:05:00,580
You're worried too much.

5206
04:05:00,640 --> 04:05:02,480
Yeah, stop worrying.

5207
04:05:04,500 --> 04:05:05,120
I can't do anything.

5208
04:05:05,120 --> 04:05:05,900
Oh, it's like candy.

5209
04:05:08,060 --> 04:05:09,220
Oh, it's like candy.

5210
04:05:09,220 --> 04:05:09,700
I can fly!

5211
04:05:11,140 --> 04:05:12,840
Whoa, what is this?

5212
04:05:12,900 --> 04:05:13,920
I'm floating!

5213
04:05:14,570 --> 04:05:15,280
Can I fly?

5214
04:05:16,480 --> 04:05:17,100
Cool!

5215
04:05:21,490 --> 04:05:22,310
That's so cool!

5216
04:05:23,110 --> 04:05:23,490
Right?

5217
04:05:24,030 --> 04:05:26,590
Yeah, you got me.

5218
04:05:26,910 --> 04:05:28,610
I thought it was candy.

5219
04:05:28,610 --> 04:05:29,470
Eat all of them!

5220
04:05:29,550 --> 04:05:31,350
If I eat all of them, I'll fly even higher!

5221
04:05:31,350 --> 04:05:33,410
It's called a floaty tablet.

5222
04:05:33,750 --> 04:05:35,950
You can have more if you want.

5223
04:05:36,150 --> 04:05:37,650
Wonka if he made Pez.

5224
04:05:38,910 --> 04:05:43,030
I can't see how these will be useful, but sure, why not.

5225
04:05:45,450 --> 04:05:48,310
Anyway, you Peachy are good with bots, right?

5226
04:05:49,310 --> 04:05:51,530
Can you fix a broken game console?

5227
04:05:53,710 --> 04:05:56,150
Yeah, even a baby could do that.

5228
04:05:58,150 --> 04:05:58,710
Really?

5229
04:05:59,010 --> 04:06:00,690
Can I bring it next time?

5230
04:06:01,890 --> 04:06:04,170
My console has been broken for ages.

5231
04:06:05,390 --> 04:06:05,830
No!

5232
04:06:05,830 --> 04:06:07,050
Not the console!

5233
04:06:08,230 --> 04:06:08,670
Sweet!

5234
04:06:12,640 --> 04:06:14,080
Marsha, thank you for the super chat.

5235
04:06:14,140 --> 04:06:14,960
Thank you, thank you!

5236
04:06:15,140 --> 04:06:18,940
Fun fact, non-lethal guns are actually called less than lethal nowadays.

5237
04:06:19,100 --> 04:06:24,200
This thing is technically kill when used in the head and at point blank, you know what to do with it.

5238
04:06:24,260 --> 04:06:25,360
Thank you for the super chat.

5239
04:06:25,480 --> 04:06:26,400
Thank you, thank you!

5240
04:06:26,560 --> 04:06:27,480
Holy shit!

5241
04:06:30,060 --> 04:06:31,140
I mean, that's true.

5242
04:06:31,460 --> 04:06:33,120
Especially like, you can actually like...

5243
04:06:33,200 --> 04:06:35,340
lose an eye from it too and shit like that.

5244
04:06:38,920 --> 04:06:40,200
Alright, let's see.

5245
04:06:41,220 --> 04:06:42,260
We gotta...

5246
04:06:42,260 --> 04:06:43,580
I can fly now!

5247
04:06:43,880 --> 04:06:44,940
How do I eat it?

5248
04:06:45,440 --> 04:06:46,840
How do I eat my item?

5249
04:06:48,000 --> 04:06:48,520
Consumables.

5250
04:06:49,140 --> 04:06:49,900
What's it called?

5251
04:06:51,560 --> 04:06:52,740
What the fuck is it called?

5252
04:06:52,880 --> 04:06:53,640
The floaty tablet?

5253
04:06:53,980 --> 04:06:55,800
Can't even actually eat it!

5254
04:06:55,940 --> 04:06:56,640
It's just...

5255
04:06:59,480 --> 04:07:01,720
It's just aesthetics in my inventory.

5256
04:07:07,430 --> 04:07:09,230
Alright, nice.

5257
04:07:09,370 --> 04:07:11,510
I got standard spring and standard gear.

5258
04:07:14,070 --> 04:07:15,550
I can't believe it.

5259
04:07:16,650 --> 04:07:18,590
It's just there to look pretty.

5260
04:07:18,710 --> 04:07:20,570
It's just there to take up my inventory space.

5261
04:07:21,930 --> 04:07:24,310
At least there's no like, weight in this.

5262
04:07:24,470 --> 04:07:26,910
So I don't have to worry about being cumbered.

5263
04:07:27,030 --> 04:07:27,310
Where's the old man?

5264
04:07:28,190 --> 04:07:29,490
He left the village.

5265
04:07:29,810 --> 04:07:31,650
Saying he needed some time alone.

5266
04:07:32,030 --> 04:07:33,030
Oh no, he's emo!

5267
04:07:33,030 --> 04:07:35,410
Alright, let's go after him.

5268
04:07:36,410 --> 04:07:37,010
Alright.

5269
04:07:38,230 --> 04:07:40,950
Would you pass on a message to Rao for me?

5270
04:07:41,570 --> 04:07:48,550
Even now that this vast river has returned, there are some mistakes that can't be washed away.

5271
04:07:49,170 --> 04:07:54,490
But with the help of your new companions, your future can be bright and unblemished.

5272
04:07:54,790 --> 04:07:57,110
He's just suffering from PTSD at the moment.

5273
04:07:57,810 --> 04:07:58,510
Got it.

5274
04:07:58,590 --> 04:07:59,510
I'll let him know.

5275
04:08:01,910 --> 04:08:02,510
Alright.

5276
04:08:02,590 --> 04:08:02,850
Alright.

5277
04:08:03,030 --> 04:08:05,310
I think I'm gonna call it here, guys.

5278
04:08:05,690 --> 04:08:07,710
Oh my god, I've been playing for four hours?

5279
04:08:08,230 --> 04:08:12,930
Okay, not gonna lie, the longer I play this game, I feel like the better it gets.

5280
04:08:13,230 --> 04:08:17,910
I'm gonna go save, but I'm not gonna show you guys the save because I don't know if it's gonna like, freak out again.

5281
04:08:20,850 --> 04:08:23,250
But I've been enjoying the lore of the story.

5282
04:08:23,270 --> 04:08:24,370
It's freaking out, by the way.

5283
04:08:24,470 --> 04:08:29,550
So, that's good that like, that's good that I tabbed it out for you guys.

5284
04:08:32,250 --> 04:08:33,010
But I've been playing for four hours.

5285
04:08:33,010 --> 04:08:34,730
I've been enjoying the game a lot so far.

5286
04:08:34,950 --> 04:08:38,810
I think I like, I've been... the story has been like, pretty interesting.

5287
04:08:39,270 --> 04:08:46,850
And like, apparently, where we stopped at when we defeated the commander is where the manga ended.

5288
04:08:47,070 --> 04:08:48,790
Manga and anime ended, right?

5289
04:08:49,030 --> 04:08:50,510
Or is the manga and anime still going?

5290
04:08:50,690 --> 04:08:51,810
I don't know, sure, not sure.

5291
04:08:52,230 --> 04:08:53,750
Is the anime still going?

5292
04:08:53,890 --> 04:09:00,190
But, um, so like, after that is when there's like, new... it's basically new stuff.

5293
04:09:00,330 --> 04:09:02,170
I haven't watched the anime before.

5294
04:09:02,170 --> 04:09:03,970
So like, I don't... I'm not sure yet.

5295
04:09:04,050 --> 04:09:05,470
Cause I wouldn't... I wouldn't have implied.

5296
04:09:06,490 --> 04:09:06,970
Um...

5297
04:09:07,790 --> 04:09:10,810
But the story so far, I really... I actually...

5298
04:09:11,310 --> 04:09:15,570
Uh... I actually really enjoyed the story so far.

5299
04:09:15,910 --> 04:09:18,130
And the fact that there's more to it.

5300
04:09:18,170 --> 04:09:19,730
It felt like it was the end.

5301
04:09:19,850 --> 04:09:22,710
And then they were like, by the way, this is only chapter 14 of 31.

5302
04:09:23,050 --> 04:09:24,230
I'm like, huh?

5303
04:09:26,210 --> 04:09:27,730
14 out of 31?

5304
04:09:28,330 --> 04:09:31,490
What do you mean 14 out of 31?

5305
04:09:32,270 --> 04:09:32,830
Uh...

5306
04:09:32,830 --> 04:09:37,930
Uh... but I... it's been very enjoyable so far.

5307
04:09:38,290 --> 04:09:40,630
It sucks that this game isn't more popular.

5308
04:09:40,810 --> 04:09:43,470
I thought this game would have been like, super popular.

5309
04:09:43,790 --> 04:09:48,270
Because it's the first game released post like, the passing of Toriyama.

5310
04:09:48,870 --> 04:09:51,110
Um... and the fact that like...

5311
04:09:51,110 --> 04:09:52,730
I think it's also because...

5312
04:09:52,730 --> 04:09:54,910
Okay, I think, not gonna lie.

5313
04:09:55,150 --> 04:09:58,390
I think the reason why this game was not... is not as popular.

5314
04:09:58,930 --> 04:09:59,930
Is because...

5315
04:09:59,930 --> 04:10:02,150
Because Stellar Blade released it.

5316
04:10:02,170 --> 04:10:03,210
At the same time.

5317
04:10:05,810 --> 04:10:08,750
So... and Stellar Blade had more...

5318
04:10:08,750 --> 04:10:10,210
Like, I guess like...

5319
04:10:10,210 --> 04:10:14,850
There's more... more things going around with Stellar Blade.

5320
04:10:15,310 --> 04:10:18,070
Than there was about...

5321
04:10:18,070 --> 04:10:22,790
Like in terms of like, there were a lot of things... news going around with Stellar Blade.

5322
04:10:23,190 --> 04:10:23,910
So...

5323
04:10:28,610 --> 04:10:29,450
So...

5324
04:10:29,450 --> 04:10:30,130
Um...

5325
04:10:31,890 --> 04:10:32,610
Um... so...

5326
04:10:33,130 --> 04:10:34,430
It's unfortunate that...

5327
04:10:34,430 --> 04:10:36,510
Sandland released at the same time.

5328
04:10:37,330 --> 04:10:37,690
And...

5329
04:10:38,690 --> 04:10:39,050
Um...

5330
04:10:39,050 --> 04:10:41,790
And yeah, Stellar Blade got a lot of free publicity.

5331
04:10:42,490 --> 04:10:43,690
Um... but I honestly...

5332
04:10:43,690 --> 04:10:45,450
Really... I've been really enjoying...

5333
04:10:46,150 --> 04:10:47,410
I've been really enjoying...

5334
04:10:47,410 --> 04:10:47,970
Uh...

5335
04:10:48,530 --> 04:10:49,710
Um... Sandland so far.

5336
04:10:49,830 --> 04:10:50,810
Katz, thank you for the super chat.

5337
04:10:50,870 --> 04:10:51,490
Thank you, thank you.

5338
04:10:51,570 --> 04:10:52,850
The story is super cool.

5339
04:10:53,150 --> 04:10:54,550
Never heard of Sandland before.

5340
04:10:54,650 --> 04:10:56,550
But I really wanted to get into the manga and game show now.

5341
04:10:56,630 --> 04:10:57,830
Thanks for the stream on it so far.

5342
04:10:57,910 --> 04:10:58,510
Thank you for the super chat.

5343
04:10:58,510 --> 04:10:59,350
Thank you, thank you.

5344
04:10:59,450 --> 04:11:00,710
Yeah, it's actually...

5345
04:11:00,710 --> 04:11:02,710
I've actually been enjoying it a lot.

5346
04:11:02,770 --> 04:11:03,910
Like the story.

5347
04:11:04,210 --> 04:11:07,010
And I think it's also because it's like an action RPG.

5348
04:11:07,430 --> 04:11:10,350
I know I'm not doing a lot of the side quests because I've never been like...

5349
04:11:10,350 --> 04:11:11,750
A side quest person.

5350
04:11:14,270 --> 04:11:15,150
I'm really...

5351
04:11:15,150 --> 04:11:16,110
I'm really sorry.

5352
04:11:16,290 --> 04:11:18,470
I just like want to know more about the main story too.

5353
04:11:18,590 --> 04:11:21,730
I found the main story to be really interesting.

5354
04:11:21,970 --> 04:11:25,690
But I just want to progress the main story just to see what's going on.

5355
04:11:26,250 --> 04:11:26,730
Um...

5356
04:11:26,730 --> 04:11:27,810
And like...

5357
04:11:27,810 --> 04:11:29,610
Just want to see what's going to happen next.

5358
04:11:29,750 --> 04:11:32,570
Also the vehicles are really fun to use and stuff.

5359
04:11:33,250 --> 04:11:33,890
Um...

5360
04:11:35,210 --> 04:11:35,850
And...

5361
04:11:35,850 --> 04:11:40,010
Your town has no features because there's no side quest!

5362
04:11:43,310 --> 04:11:46,010
When can I use my chairs?

5363
04:11:47,570 --> 04:11:50,370
Is it because I didn't do the side quest?

5364
04:11:50,470 --> 04:11:53,110
So I can't use my chairs?

5365
04:11:53,390 --> 04:11:54,030
Is

5366
04:11:57,220 --> 04:11:58,140
that...

5367
04:12:01,440 --> 04:12:02,120
Um...

5368
04:12:03,060 --> 04:12:03,740
Anyway.

5369
04:12:03,980 --> 04:12:04,380
Okay.

5370
04:12:04,580 --> 04:12:04,840
Okay.

5371
04:12:04,880 --> 04:12:05,500
So...

5372
04:12:05,500 --> 04:12:06,120
Um...

5373
04:12:06,120 --> 04:12:07,560
We are going...

5374
04:12:07,560 --> 04:12:08,000
Oh yeah.

5375
04:12:08,080 --> 04:12:08,900
It actually is.

5376
04:12:09,040 --> 04:12:09,500
Oh okay.

5377
04:12:11,300 --> 04:12:11,980
Yes.

5378
04:12:12,980 --> 04:12:13,660
100%.

5379
04:12:16,780 --> 04:12:17,460
Okay.

5380
04:12:17,900 --> 04:12:23,060
I haven't unlocked it yet because I haven't done any of the side quests.

5381
04:12:23,240 --> 04:12:24,940
Side quest locked.

5382
04:12:25,380 --> 04:12:25,860
No!

5383
04:12:27,720 --> 04:12:28,400
Anyway.

5384
04:12:28,540 --> 04:12:30,160
It is code time!

5385
04:12:30,160 --> 04:12:31,540
As I mentioned before.

5386
04:12:32,240 --> 04:12:32,720
Um...

5387
04:12:32,720 --> 04:12:34,260
It's two Steam codes.

5388
04:12:34,380 --> 04:12:36,120
Two PlayStation codes.

5389
04:12:36,400 --> 04:12:38,300
And two Xbox codes.

5390
04:12:38,420 --> 04:12:39,160
So I'm just going to...

5391
04:12:39,160 --> 04:12:41,700
What I'll be doing is I'm literally just going to...

5392
04:12:41,700 --> 04:12:42,540
I'm literally...

5393
04:12:42,540 --> 04:12:45,720
All I'm doing is just copy and pasting the code in the chat.

5394
04:12:45,820 --> 04:12:46,880
But I'll give you guys...

5395
04:12:46,880 --> 04:12:47,740
Um...

5396
04:12:47,740 --> 04:12:50,660
I'll give you guys a like warning before I do.

5397
04:12:51,240 --> 04:12:51,720
Like...

5398
04:12:53,580 --> 04:12:54,060
So...

5399
04:12:54,060 --> 04:12:56,620
I'll post the first code right...

5400
04:12:56,620 --> 04:12:57,600
I'll post the first code.

5401
04:12:57,660 --> 04:12:58,240
I'll do a countdown.

5402
04:12:58,460 --> 04:12:59,140
Are you guys ready?

5403
04:12:59,140 --> 04:13:00,200
Here's the countdown.

5404
04:13:00,980 --> 04:13:01,460
Five.

5405
04:13:01,940 --> 04:13:02,420
Four.

5406
04:13:03,100 --> 04:13:03,580
Three.

5407
04:13:03,640 --> 04:13:05,020
This is the Steam code by the way.

5408
04:13:05,100 --> 04:13:06,020
I'm doing the countdown again.

5409
04:13:07,140 --> 04:13:08,480
This is the Steam code.

5410
04:13:09,080 --> 04:13:09,560
Five.

5411
04:13:09,760 --> 04:13:10,240
Four.

5412
04:13:10,840 --> 04:13:11,320
Three.

5413
04:13:11,880 --> 04:13:12,360
Two.

5414
04:13:13,040 --> 04:13:13,520
One.

5415
04:13:14,760 --> 04:13:15,840
Here's the first one.

5416
04:13:16,040 --> 04:13:16,560
Good luck.

5417
04:13:16,640 --> 04:13:16,940
Good luck.

5418
04:13:16,980 --> 04:13:17,320
Good luck.

5419
04:13:18,880 --> 04:13:20,040
You know, I'm going to do an interchange.

5420
04:13:20,240 --> 04:13:22,760
And then the next one will be like...

5421
04:13:22,760 --> 04:13:23,380
All right.

5422
04:13:23,380 --> 04:13:23,800
Good luck.

5423
04:13:23,860 --> 04:13:24,340
Anyone...

5424
04:13:24,340 --> 04:13:25,580
Is it activated now?

5425
04:13:25,840 --> 04:13:26,700
Has it been activated?

5426
04:13:28,180 --> 04:13:28,660
Yeah.

5427
04:13:28,760 --> 04:13:29,120
I'm going to do an interchange.

5428
04:13:29,120 --> 04:13:29,600
Good luck.

5429
04:13:29,700 --> 04:13:31,360
Free for all.

5430
04:13:34,540 --> 04:13:35,620
Who got it?

5431
04:13:35,680 --> 04:13:36,460
Someone got it?

5432
04:13:36,540 --> 04:13:37,160
Who got it?

5433
04:13:37,220 --> 04:13:38,180
Who was the lucky one?

5434
04:13:38,980 --> 04:13:39,520
Tell us.

5435
04:13:41,640 --> 04:13:42,540
Me smile.

5436
04:13:45,140 --> 04:13:45,920
All right.

5437
04:13:46,360 --> 04:13:46,880
Okay.

5438
04:13:47,060 --> 04:13:47,380
All right.

5439
04:13:47,400 --> 04:13:48,760
This one is PlayStation.

5440
04:13:49,500 --> 04:13:51,900
I pressed cancel by accident.

5441
04:13:53,220 --> 04:13:53,960
All right.

5442
04:13:53,980 --> 04:13:55,500
This one's the PlayStation code.

5443
04:13:55,880 --> 04:13:59,100
So people who are on the PlayStation, I hope you have a great day.

5444
04:13:59,120 --> 04:13:59,760
I'm going to boot it up.

5445
04:13:59,780 --> 04:14:00,680
No, it's two each.

5446
04:14:00,920 --> 04:14:01,660
But I'll...

5447
04:14:01,660 --> 04:14:04,160
I'm just going like down one by one.

5448
04:14:04,420 --> 04:14:05,680
So all right.

5449
04:14:05,700 --> 04:14:07,000
This is the PlayStation code.

5450
04:14:07,380 --> 04:14:09,220
Whoever has their PlayStation up.

5451
04:14:09,460 --> 04:14:10,380
All right, guys.

5452
04:14:10,940 --> 04:14:11,980
Boot your PlayStation.

5453
04:14:12,400 --> 04:14:13,080
Four or five.

5454
04:14:13,220 --> 04:14:13,900
It's like both.

5455
04:14:13,960 --> 04:14:14,540
I'm pretty sure.

5456
04:14:14,660 --> 04:14:15,420
I think it's like...

5457
04:14:15,420 --> 04:14:16,280
I'm honestly...

5458
04:14:16,280 --> 04:14:17,260
I think if you have a place...

5459
04:14:17,260 --> 04:14:17,680
I don't know.

5460
04:14:17,720 --> 04:14:19,180
Honestly, maybe it's PlayStation 4.

5461
04:14:19,340 --> 04:14:20,400
It just says PlayStation.

5462
04:14:20,600 --> 04:14:22,640
So boot up your PlayStations.

5463
04:14:22,640 --> 04:14:23,540
Are you guys ready?

5464
04:14:24,020 --> 04:14:26,400
Do you guys have your PlayStation ready, guys?

5465
04:14:26,720 --> 04:14:27,880
To activate this?

5466
04:14:28,680 --> 04:14:29,100
I'm going to boot it up.

5467
04:14:32,260 --> 04:14:33,340
Do you guys have it?

5468
04:14:33,380 --> 04:14:34,680
Do you guys have it ready?

5469
04:14:35,060 --> 04:14:36,320
Lag is crazy.

5470
04:14:36,660 --> 04:14:39,400
Look, the moment you see the code, then you're fine.

5471
04:14:40,540 --> 04:14:41,060
Okay.

5472
04:14:41,800 --> 04:14:42,320
Five.

5473
04:14:43,180 --> 04:14:43,700
Four.

5474
04:14:44,720 --> 04:14:45,240
Three.

5475
04:14:46,180 --> 04:14:46,700
Two.

5476
04:14:48,260 --> 04:14:48,780
One.

5477
04:14:50,120 --> 04:14:50,640
Boom.

5478
04:14:50,740 --> 04:14:51,600
There you go.

5479
04:14:51,840 --> 04:14:52,280
All right.

5480
04:14:52,300 --> 04:14:53,360
Get your Xbox ready.

5481
04:14:53,560 --> 04:14:55,240
Guys, Xbox is next.

5482
04:14:56,000 --> 04:14:57,160
Xbox is next.

5483
04:14:57,200 --> 04:14:57,920
Who has...

5484
04:14:57,920 --> 04:14:58,600
Okay.

5485
04:14:58,660 --> 04:14:59,100
The PlayStation is ready.

5486
04:14:59,100 --> 04:15:00,980
PlayStation people actually have to type this out.

5487
04:15:01,120 --> 04:15:04,340
So, like, they have to type this out.

5488
04:15:04,420 --> 04:15:08,300
Oh, by the way, the Xbox code is fucking long.

5489
04:15:13,260 --> 04:15:15,060
Oh, I see someone got it.

5490
04:15:17,620 --> 04:15:18,700
Draven, congratulations.

5491
04:15:19,560 --> 04:15:20,940
The ice dragon.

5492
04:15:21,200 --> 04:15:22,700
They got the sad land.

5493
04:15:23,300 --> 04:15:23,840
Congratulations.

5494
04:15:25,240 --> 04:15:25,780
Woo.

5495
04:15:26,940 --> 04:15:29,040
The fastest PlayStation typing.

5496
04:15:29,040 --> 04:15:29,080
I'm going to go to the next one.

5497
04:15:29,080 --> 04:15:29,300
Okay.

5498
04:15:29,460 --> 04:15:30,520
Xbox is next.

5499
04:15:30,780 --> 04:15:31,860
You guys got...

5500
04:15:31,860 --> 04:15:32,220
Okay.

5501
04:15:32,320 --> 04:15:35,040
The Xbox one is fucking long.

5502
04:15:39,940 --> 04:15:41,960
Doki running a code fight pit.

5503
04:15:42,060 --> 04:15:44,360
We who are about to die salute you, I guess.

5504
04:15:44,620 --> 04:15:46,080
AV, thank you for the super chat.

5505
04:15:46,180 --> 04:15:46,460
Thank you.

5506
04:15:46,480 --> 04:15:47,080
Thank you.

5507
04:15:47,080 --> 04:15:48,680
Get your Xbox out, guys.

5508
04:15:49,000 --> 04:15:50,460
Power went out.

5509
04:15:50,940 --> 04:15:53,280
Got your Xbox out, guys.

5510
04:15:53,320 --> 04:15:54,400
All three of you.

5511
04:15:54,560 --> 04:15:56,700
I bet you guys can get it.

5512
04:15:56,900 --> 04:15:57,420
Okay.

5513
04:15:59,080 --> 04:16:01,460
Oh, you claimed the PlayStation code on the website?

5514
04:16:01,880 --> 04:16:03,400
Guys, okay, I didn't know that.

5515
04:16:03,500 --> 04:16:04,580
I thought you had to type this out.

5516
04:16:04,880 --> 04:16:05,940
I don't know about Xbox.

5517
04:16:06,180 --> 04:16:08,020
Can you guys claim it on the website as well?

5518
04:16:11,420 --> 04:16:12,120
All right.

5519
04:16:12,360 --> 04:16:13,000
All right.

5520
04:16:13,000 --> 04:16:13,780
Are you guys ready?

5521
04:16:14,000 --> 04:16:16,340
Log into Microsoft store on your PC.

5522
04:16:16,420 --> 04:16:16,940
Oh, shit.

5523
04:16:17,000 --> 04:16:17,760
The strats.

5524
04:16:17,900 --> 04:16:19,300
The strats, guys.

5525
04:16:20,180 --> 04:16:21,020
That's cheating.

5526
04:16:21,840 --> 04:16:24,480
We have to go buy an Xbox, please.

5527
04:16:24,820 --> 04:16:25,260
Okay.

5528
04:16:25,320 --> 04:16:25,980
Are you guys ready?

5529
04:16:26,300 --> 04:16:27,320
I'm going to do a countdown.

5530
04:16:28,140 --> 04:16:29,060
Five, six, seven, eight.

5531
04:16:29,060 --> 04:16:32,640
Four, three, two, one.

5532
04:16:33,560 --> 04:16:34,080
Boom.

5533
04:16:34,360 --> 04:16:36,300
And then a surprise twist.

5534
04:16:36,680 --> 04:16:38,580
I'm not going to go back to the PC yet.

5535
04:16:38,580 --> 04:16:42,220
The last PC Steam code will be the last one I'm giving out.

5536
04:16:42,500 --> 04:16:43,880
The next one is PlayStation.

5537
04:16:43,940 --> 04:16:45,140
I'm giving out another PlayStation.

5538
04:16:48,970 --> 04:16:50,630
I told you it's lag.

5539
04:16:50,810 --> 04:16:51,790
I was like, get ready.

5540
04:16:51,870 --> 04:16:53,130
It's pretty fucking lag.

5541
04:16:57,710 --> 04:16:58,930
I don't know.

5542
04:16:58,930 --> 04:17:00,370
I just got the code.

5543
04:17:00,610 --> 04:17:02,330
I'm not supposed to know.

5544
04:17:03,150 --> 04:17:06,750
Countdown is useless when there's 30 seconds of lag.

5545
04:17:09,970 --> 04:17:12,370
I pressed redeem without confirming.

5546
04:17:13,110 --> 04:17:14,270
Did anyone get it?

5547
04:17:16,070 --> 04:17:17,330
Did anyone get it?

5548
04:17:18,450 --> 04:17:19,010
Damn.

5549
04:17:19,790 --> 04:17:20,770
That's cheating.

5550
04:17:20,850 --> 04:17:22,330
What do you mean that's cheating?

5551
04:17:22,510 --> 04:17:23,250
I don't...

5552
04:17:26,070 --> 04:17:26,630
Okay.

5553
04:17:26,750 --> 04:17:27,790
I'll do it in 10 seconds.

5554
04:17:27,890 --> 04:17:28,910
So, when I hit five, six, seven, eight.

5555
04:17:28,930 --> 04:17:30,090
5, you know it's ready.

5556
04:17:32,250 --> 04:17:33,190
Who's got it?

5557
04:17:34,910 --> 04:17:35,430
Okay.

5558
04:17:35,730 --> 04:17:37,090
All right, guys.

5559
04:17:37,210 --> 04:17:37,490
All right.

5560
04:17:37,510 --> 04:17:39,230
This is a PlayStation code.

5561
04:17:39,530 --> 04:17:41,230
I'll give a 10 second countdown.

5562
04:17:41,510 --> 04:17:45,130
So when I hit 5, you'll know when this look.

5563
04:17:45,330 --> 04:17:45,650
Okay.

5564
04:17:48,410 --> 04:17:48,930
Okay.

5565
04:17:50,370 --> 04:17:59,790
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

5566
04:18:00,250 --> 04:18:00,810
PlayStation.

5567
04:18:01,870 --> 04:18:02,710
This is the PlayStation.

5568
04:18:03,270 --> 04:18:05,050
And then we're going to go with Xbox next.

5569
04:18:07,050 --> 04:18:09,210
I like how someone's like type it you coward.

I really like the person is like stop.

5572
04:18:20,910 --> 04:18:22,990
Don't you dare copy and paste it.

5573
04:18:23,070 --> 04:18:24,370
I got a creeper.

5574
04:18:24,390 --> 04:18:26,890
Congratulations creeper.

5575
04:18:28,130 --> 04:18:30,650
Congratulations on getting the PlayStation code.

5576
04:18:31,610 --> 04:18:32,130
Congrats.

5577
04:18:32,630 --> 04:18:33,010

5578
04:18:33,010 --> 04:18:33,930

5585
04:19:02,930 --> 04:19:03,450
Bam.

5586
04:19:04,810 --> 04:19:05,330
Hey.

5587
04:19:06,550 --> 04:19:07,670
I have an Xbox.

5588
04:19:07,850 --> 04:19:09,510
I just don't feel like going to my basement.

5589
04:19:10,970 --> 04:19:12,510
He's just here for the ride.

5590
04:19:15,850 --> 04:19:16,890
It's rigged.

5591
04:19:20,930 --> 04:19:23,090
All right, there's the long code.

Whoever got that was fucking fast.

5599
04:19:40,210 --> 04:19:42,330
Bone viewers have no chance.

5600
04:19:42,830 --> 04:19:50,210
Damn speedrunners chat kept moving up and stopped me from redeeming bro.

5601
04:19:50,310 --> 04:19:51,630
That's fucking evil.

5602
04:19:52,220 --> 04:19:53,970
That's actually evil.

5603
04:19:56,280 --> 04:19:57,710

5626
04:20:54,050 --> 04:20:54,970
Who got it?

5627
04:20:55,090 --> 04:20:56,750

5628
04:20:56,850 --> 04:20:57,570
Rest in peace.

5629
04:20:57,570 --> 04:20:57,850
Bro.

5630
04:21:02,250 --> 04:21:03,130
Stop typing.

5631
04:21:03,130 --> 04:21:05,310
I can't copy the code.

5632
04:21:08,310 --> 04:21:08,910
Bro.

5633
04:21:10,910 --> 04:21:12,330

5634
04:21:12,710 --> 04:21:13,790

04:21:20,730 --> 04:21:21,330

5637
04:21:21,430 --> 04:21:22,550
I don't know who got it.

5638
04:21:22,730 --> 04:21:24,870
Then who got the the steam one?

5639
04:21:25,410 --> 04:21:26,650
I'm on a day.

5640
04:21:26,650 --> 04:21:27,910

5641
04:21:27,930 --> 04:21:28,530

Everybody who got the code who got the six copies of Sandland again.

5653
04:21:48,590 --> 04:21:56,470
A huge shout out to Bandai for giving me a giving me free copies to give away to the dragon.

5654
04:21:57,190 --> 04:22:02,230
They didn't have to do that, but they did and I really appreciate it appreciate them in the support.

5655
04:22:02,570 --> 04:22:08,410
Like I said before in the beginning, I never really had chance to really play Bandai games there ever at one point.

5656
04:22:08,490 --> 04:22:09,410
I really want to play Digimon.

5657
04:22:09,590 --> 04:22:20,970
But because like perms issue like we couldn't and then the fact that like not guy was like super supportive Band America was super supportive me like playing Bandai games in the future as well.

5658
04:22:21,130 --> 04:22:23,470
I really really do appreciate it.

5659
04:22:23,550 --> 04:22:26,370
And the fact that they wanted to send me some like.

5660
04:22:32,050 --> 04:22:33,570
I'm going to call it here.

5661
04:22:33,710 --> 04:22:35,730
Today has been a really long stream.

5662
04:22:35,990 --> 04:22:37,690

It was a nice, chill stream.

5667
04:22:48,150 --> 04:22:50,250
I know it's part two of an RPG.

5668
04:22:51,610 --> 04:22:55,650
I knew a lot of people were going to turn up for this one.

5669
04:22:55,650 --> 04:22:59,950
But I still wanted to keep going because I've been enjoying the story so far.

5670
04:23:00,290 --> 04:23:03,490
And I've actually been enjoying the experience of Sand Land.

5671
04:23:03,890 --> 04:23:05,070
But yeah, thank you everybody.

5672
04:23:05,330 --> 04:23:10,030
As always, everyone, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5673
04:23:10,170 --> 04:23:13,290
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed because you deserve it!

5674
04:23:13,390 --> 04:23:14,530

Thank you, thank you.

5679
04:23:23,810 --> 04:23:25,410
I think Bandai should give one more code.

5680
04:23:25,490 --> 04:23:25,630
So I can...

5681
04:23:25,650 --> 04:23:28,170
So those of us that choked can get a second chat.

5682
04:23:28,810 --> 04:23:30,150
Thank you for the super chat.

5683
04:23:30,270 --> 04:23:31,490
Thank you, thank you.

5684
04:23:32,650 --> 04:23:35,030
Ninjutsu, you know you're going to choke again, Ninjutsu.

5685
04:23:35,230 --> 04:23:36,450
It's just going to get worse.

5686
04:23:36,650 --> 04:23:37,830
Anyway guys, bye everybody!

5687
04:23:38,170 --> 04:23:38,570
