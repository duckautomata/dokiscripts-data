00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,600
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,300
I... fucked up.

3
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,660
Okay, there's a lot of stuff in regards of...

4
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,480
How did you fuck up, Doki?

5
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,300
Well...

6
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Let's just say...

7
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,060
Okay, so we all know I have this really big problem regarding saying no.

8
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,680
So, remember when I was telling you guys, like, oh, hey guys, I had a deadlocked tournament invitation.

9
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,040
But I'm gonna say no to it.

10
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,680
So, guess who didn't say no?

11
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,280
Guess who didn't say no at the last minute?

12
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
So, what happened?

13
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,640
What happened was that...

14
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,080
I was talking with Gumi yesterday.

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,480
Like, I was on a call with her.

16
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,300
And I was, like, she was talking to me about deadlock because she's obsessed with deadlock right now.

17
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,720
And, like, it's literally, she was like, I don't even like Valorant anymore.

18
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,080
All I do is play deadlock.

19
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,440
And I was like, oh, that's funny.

20
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,700
That's so funny.

21
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,940
Cause, like, I actually got invited to a deadlock tournament.

22
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,640
That's like a charity tournament for tomorrow.

23
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,540
But, like, I didn't, like, I forgot to say no.

24
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,860
Cause, like, I was going to, but then I got really sick.

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,580
So, like, I was gonna reply to them and say no.

26
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,600
And then, she was like...

27
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,800
Oh, why didn't you say no?

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,620
I was like, well, I couldn't get a team going.

29
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,880
And the only person I knew that played deadlock was Surefour.

30
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,220
And you.

31
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,280
I was like, I didn't really know how to get a team going on.

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,200
And then she was like, I can get you a team.

33
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,700
And, like, do you think you still have that spot?

34
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,240
I was like...

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,100
I don't know.

36
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,430
I mean...

37
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,210
I mean, if you really want to play, I can...

38
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,550
I can ask if they still have that spot.

39
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,230
And she's like...

40
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,130
Oh, yeah.

41
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,090
I mean, if they say...

42
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,530
If they still have it, we can do it together.

43
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,810
I was like...

44
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:55,890
Okay.

45
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,750
You know, I'm just like, there's no way they still have that spot.

46
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,750
The tournament is literally in two days.

47
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,290
By the way, it's tomorrow.

48
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,090
Cause, like, this all happened yesterday.

49
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,070
So, I was like, oh, there's no way.

50
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,970
There's no way they still have this spot.

51
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,750
The tournament is in two days.

52
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,450
And now, today...

53
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,830
I got a message back.

54
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,830
And they were like...

55
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,110
Oh, we actually still need one more team.

56
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,470
And anyway...

57
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,830
So, like, I mean, if you have a team...

58
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,710
And then, I looked at the thing.

59
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,490
I looked at the guide.

60
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,330
And they sent me the package of, like, the instruction.

61
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,010
And then...

62
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,570
And then, I was like...

63
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,230
Wait.

64
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,470
This is a European tournament.

65
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,430
I was like...

66
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,250
Wait a minute.

67
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,470
This tournament is in European hours.

68
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,610
What the fuck is...

69
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,670
What is 4 CEST?

70
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,830
And then, like...

71
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,550
Cause they're like...

72
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,210
The tournament starts at 4 CEST.

73
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,990
And I was like...

74
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,190
What the fuck is CEST?

75
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,390
By the way, for those who don't know what CEST is...

76
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,310
It's Central Eastern European Time.

77
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,610
So, I was like...

78
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,230
What the fuck?

79
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,230
And then...

80
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,010
And then...

81
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,090
And then...

82
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,770
And then...

83
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,590
So, I was like...

84
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,050
4 CEST to PST.

85
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,190
7 in the fucking morning?

86
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,290
I was like...

87
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,450
And then, I messaged back.

88
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,250
And I was like...

89
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,310
Excuse me.

90
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,090
So, it says...

91
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,150
Is this a European tournament?

92
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,290
And then, they replied back.

93
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:29,810
Yes.

94
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,710
It's casted.

95
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,490
It is for, like...

96
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,730
It is hosted in London.

97
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,170
And I was like...

98
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,150
What?

99
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,910
I was like...

100
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,590
That's 7 in the morning.

101
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,870
That's 7?

102
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,930
That's 7?

103
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,830
And I was like...

104
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,450
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:46,970
And then...

106
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,830
I thought that was my way out.

107
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,270
You know?

108
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,610
I was like...

109
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,290
Oh...

110
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,590
It's 7 in the morning.

111
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,430
We're not gonna do 7 in the morning.

112
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,170
So, I was like...

113
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,690
Oh, I'm sorry.

114
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,590
I can't.

115
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,450
It's 7 in the morning.

116
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,430
I can't do it.

117
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,270
That's way too early.

118
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,490
And they're like...

119
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,850
Well, we can put you in the...

120
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,010
We can put you at the 12 p.m.

121
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,350
category.

122
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,190
And I was like...

123
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,990
You're supposed to say...

124
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,370
Okay.

125
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,750
Oh...

126
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,990
And then I messaged Goofy.

127
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,930
I was like...

128
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:28,730
Hey...

129
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,990
So, you know how we're not gonna do it?

130
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,050
Because it's 7 in the morning?

131
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,170
Have a 12 p.m.

132
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,290
Like, do you still wanna do it?

133
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,370
She's like...

134
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:39,590
Yeah.

135
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,570
I mean, it's 12 p.m.

136
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,630
It's not 7 in the morning.

137
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,230
So, like...

138
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,410
Yeah.

139
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:42,890
We can...

140
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,510
I can do that.

141
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,230
I'm like...

142
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,370
Oh...

143
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,210
I

144
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,380
didn't...

145
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,540
I didn't...

146
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:55,920
I was

147
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,610
like...

148
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,030
I was like...

149
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,930
Dude...

150
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,510
To the organizers, I was like...

151
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,930
Yeah.

152
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,130
I mean, like...

153
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,010
It's too much of a hassle.

154
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,990
Like, I know it's, like, super last minute.

155
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,150
I know...

156
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,030
I know it's...

157
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,890
I know it's super last minute.

158
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,550
So, it's okay.

159
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,630
It's okay if, like...

160
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,370
If, like...

161
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,090
You know...

162
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,390
If you guys don't wanna do this anymore.

163
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,010
Like...

164
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,630
It's so much to organize putting us in this tournament.

165
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,510
Like...

166
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,970
Like...

167
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,190
I'm so sorry.

168
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:27,810
And they're like...

169
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,190
No, no.

170
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,030
It's totally fine.

171
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,010
Like...

172
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,570
We totally understand.

173
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,410
Like...

174
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,650
We're so happy to have you.

175
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,070
And I'm just like...

176
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,950
Oh...

177
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,410
So...

178
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,730
Um...

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,450
Tomorrow...

180
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,690
Tomorrow...

181
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,110
Tomorrow...

182
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,570
I'm doing...

183
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,790
I'm...

184
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,210
I'm doing...

185
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,010
A...

186
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,130
A...

187
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,070
A deadlock charity tournament.

188
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,310
Um...

189
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,170
I'm doing a deadlock charity tournament at...

190
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,110
Uh...

191
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,430
At 12...

192
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,410
12pm.

193
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,570
And we don't have a full team.

194
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,210
We don't have a full team finalized yet.

195
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:18,770
But...

196
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,110
Who...

197
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,330
I...

198
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,030
I know...

199
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,030
Currently...

200
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,950
That...

201
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,410
It's me...

202
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,170
Gumi...

203
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,850
And Sejam.

204
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,670
And then...

205
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,450
Gumi and Sejam are gonna find the final three.

206
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,030
And then...

207
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,290
I...

208
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:29,990
I don't know if...

209
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,930
I don't know who the other three are.

210
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:31,910
I just know that...

211
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,590
That is my current team.

212
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,290
Right now.

213
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,130
To think of the children.

214
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,370
So we're...

215
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,010
We're...

216
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,750
Just kidding.

217
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,670
I'm not...

218
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,050
No!

219
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,830
I can't just...

220
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,530
I can't!

221
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,650
I'm in too deep!

222
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,050
And it's for charity!

223
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:44,870
Guys!

224
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:45,930
It's...

225
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,950
I'm still...

226
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,210
Thank you for the super chat.

227
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,590
Thank you.

228
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,130
Thank you.

229
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,050
Is it too late for you to say just kidding?

230
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,070
I'm not actually taking part.

231
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,290
Thank you for the super chat.

232
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:54,710
Thank you.

233
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,270
Thank you.

234
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,030
So...

235
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,270
It's for charity.

236
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:57,890
I...

237
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,690
It's for the kids.

238
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,310
And I...

239
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,590
I'm already in too deep.

240
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,950
I'm in too deep right now.

241
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,870
So...

242
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,690
That's...

243
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,170
That's...

244
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,390
Basically...

245
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:07,870
The...

246
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,610
I have eight streams for the rest of the week.

247
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,150
So...

248
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,590
Like...

249
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,610
I have three days where I'm doing double streams.

250
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,790
So...

251
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,250
Cause I don't know who else plays...

252
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,330
I don't know who plays deadlock at a decent level.

253
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,350
I was...

254
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,020
I don't...

255
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,380
I don't fucking know!

256
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,200
Like...

257
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
I literally...

258
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,820
The only reason I was going to say no was cause like...

259
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,080
I only knew Surefour and Gumi.

260
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,800
I...

261
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,760
And then I was...

262
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,220
Surefour was like...

263
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,400
Nah.

264
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,680
And then...

265
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,300
And then we...

266
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,740
And then Gumi and I tried peer pressure Surefour again today.

267
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,840
Cause we're like...

268
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,500
Cause I asked Surefour again today.

269
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,200
And he was like...

270
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,020
I thought you said no.

271
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
And I was like...

272
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,780
Well...

273
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,540
And then I was like...

274
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:45,900
Um...

275
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,340
I was going to...

276
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,400
But then like...

277
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,500
Gumi convinced me.

278
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,740
And then he was like...

279
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,240
Well...

280
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,680
And I was like...

281
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,900
Oh...

282
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,560
It's at like...

283
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,340
It's at 12.

284
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,500
And he was like...

285
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,900
Oh...

286
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,880
I have Dungeons and Dragons.

287
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,300
So even if I wanted to...

288
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,700
I couldn't.

289
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,060
And I'm like...

290
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,920
God fucking...

291
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,460
I couldn't.

292
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,360
I was just like...

293
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,400
I was just like...

294
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,180
I was just like God fucking dammit!

295
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,360
He had Dungeons and Dragons to carry me.

296
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,040
He's literally the deadlocked streamer right now!

297
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,980
I thought...

298
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,560
I thought you could help him get the games over with.

299
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,240
He could literally 1v5 all of them for us.

300
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,560
He could have 1v5'd all of them!

301
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,460
And then the game would be over.

302
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,200
The games would have been so quick.

303
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,740
Dude, priorities.

304
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,700
So...

305
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,880
Patoki D&D is important.

306
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,820
Psychos, thank you for the super chat.

307
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,540
Thank you, thank you.

308
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,220
Oh, what's this?

309
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,580
The consequences of my own actions?

310
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,880
Thank you for the super chat.

311
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,540
Thank you, thank you.

312
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,260
Also, by the way... wait, it hasn't been... oh, it hasn't been announced, but like...

313
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,680
I even have a double stream on Sunday.

314
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,920
I have a double stream on Sunday.

315
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,980
I have an unannounced... another unannounced tournament.

316
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,400
Um, that was...

317
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,220
I'm sponsored for that one, by the way.

318
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,780
Like, I'm not...

319
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,100
Like, um...

320
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm sponsored for that one, by the way.

321
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,640
I have an unannounced Sunday tournament that I'm sponsored to be in.

322
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,660
And then...

323
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,820
Um, and then I also have another stream on that day.

324
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,300
Another collab on that day, uh, that Gumi invited me to.

325
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,780
So, it's gonna be, like, nine days of, like...

326
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,500
Not only... By the way, I also have a lot of work behind the scenes!

327
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,340
I have so much stuff to do!

328
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,440
Oh my god, I don't know how I got into this situation again!

329
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,320
I don't...

330
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,340
Every time!

331
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,260
I don't know how I keep getting into this situation!

332
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm, like, sick at everything, too!

333
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,260
Oh my god.

334
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,960
So, that's how...

335
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,040
That's how the Deadlock tournament um... came to be.

336
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,860
By the way, guys...

337
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,080
They were, like, the tournament organizer was, like...

338
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
Oh, yeah!

339
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,840
But, like, um...

340
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,040
But, like...

341
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:17,080
It's a two-day tournament, but it's, like, knockout stages, so if you make it to the second day, they were, like, we're starting at six in the morning on this day, too, by the way.

342
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,420
Like, are you sure that's okay?

343
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,640
And then I was, like, we're not gonna make it to day two, so I hope to god we...

344
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,160
I hope to god I did not jinx us right there.

345
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,060
I straight up was, like, it's all right.

346
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,220
We're not gonna make it to day two.

347
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,800
So, we'll see.

348
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,820
We'll see tomorrow.

349
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,680
We'll see tomorrow what's gonna happen.

350
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,960
Because I was, like, we're not gonna throw.

351
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,680
We're not gonna throw.

352
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,500
But we're gonna see what happens.

353
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,480
It's like...

354
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,980
I don't know how I got into this situation.

355
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,080
Women who refuses to say no.

356
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,560
Thank you for the super chat.

357
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,040
Thank you.

358
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,780
Thank you.

359
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,460
Anyway.

360
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,880
So, there's that.

361
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,780
That's one life.

362
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,340
There's a lot of life updates, by the way.

363
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,880
I made a list.

364
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
Another life update.

365
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,480
Brazil is back on Twitter!

366
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,240
Okay, this is a world update.

367
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,520
I just wanted to notify you guys this, but Brazil has finally been unbanned on Twitter.

368
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,020
Because I know some of you guys actually use me as a news source.

369
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,160
So, like, I just wanted to give you guys an update on the world news.

370
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,380
So, welcome back, Brazil, on Twitter!

371
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,680
Welcome back!

372
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,580
Yeah!

373
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,640
You guys are back!

374
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,380
It got unbanned!

375
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,080
We are back, but I have no Twitter.

376
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,960
Thank you for your very first super chat.

377
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,300
Thank you.

378
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,760
Thank you.

379
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,520
Well, time to throw.

380
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you for the super chat.

381
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,380
Thank you.

382
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:48,920
Thank you.

383
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,900
Alright.

384
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,040
Another life update.

385
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,940
So...

386
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,320
Oh my god.

387
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:53,840
You know what's crazy?

388
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,040
Okay, this is actually crazy.

389
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,440
I did not realize pro players actually like, you know, like, I could see that from, like, source...

390
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,540
Oh, she cast!

391
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,420
Thank you for the super chat!

392
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,760
I saw it on Twitter!

393
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,240
Which is my news source.

394
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,660
Twitter is my news source, and I know I'm somebody's news source on this chat.

395
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:25,040
Anyway, so, I know, like, in Japan, it's, like, very common to, like, for, like, Japanese, like, pro players and, like, um, like, esports people to, like, have, like, Oshis and VTuber Oshis.

396
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,820
But I was so surprised.

397
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,740
Okay, so you remember when I told you guys that, like, I think Effect is a dragoon?

398
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,620
Okay, so I found out, like, after the tournament, I found... this actually...

399
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,800
I was so surprised.

400
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:59,880
So, after the tournament, he told me that, um, when I was, you know, when I... before I came back to being an indie, he used to... and, like, uh, I met Effect because we got in a team together for those, like, random tournaments.

401
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,580
And those, like, random tournaments, you know, like, pro players where, uh, you swap teams every... every game and stuff.

402
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,140
So I got him in a game one time, you know, before I came back to an indie.

403
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,140
I got him in... in one of my team for one of those tournaments.

404
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,020
So I thought that's how, like, he knew about me.

405
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:25,600
But apparently, he actually actively watched me before that happened.

406
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,140
And he didn't even... he wasn't even watching, like, Apex streams.

407
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,860
He was watching just, like, my streams in general.

408
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,040
And then... so he was like, oh my god, when I got you on my team during that one...

409
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,140
that tournament when we first played together, like, I was fangirling so hard.

410
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,160
And I was like, wait, what?

411
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,280
You're, like, actually a drag?

412
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,740
And he's like, yeah, no, I actually... I was... I watched...

413
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,160
I was... I watched your streams before.

414
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,240
And, like, I was like, wait, how the fuck did you buy my streams?

415
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,280
And then he was like, oh, I was just looking around YouTube.

416
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,760
And, like, I just thought your content was really funny.

417
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,100
And so I was like, wait, do you still watch me?

418
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,360
And then he was like, yeah, whenever I have time from, like, pro play, I try to watch you.

419
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,940
And I'm like, oh my god!

420
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,920
Is that crazy?

421
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,360
He's, like, an actual dragoon!

422
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,060
Holy shit!

423
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,180
That blew my fucking mind!

424
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,500
I was so surprised, because I was like, what the fuck?

425
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,640
You had people like, oh my god, they...

426
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,780
I was so surprised.

427
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:38,980
Um...

428
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,920
It was very surprising for me, because for me, I'm like, wow, I get to play with pros!

429
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,140
Like, because, like, Effect is, like, literally probably one of the best team... Apex teams in the world.

430
00:16:50,260 --> 00:17:01,180
And, like, and he got, like, he, like, got, like, three times number one pred back to back for three seasons in a row when he was, like, seventeen.

431
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,520
And I'm like, Jesus Christ!

432
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,240
I was like, wait, you watched me?

433
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,920
Like...

434
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,600
I was so... I was so surprised.

435
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,980
Um...

436
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,360
Anyway, that's another update.

437
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,040
And so, like, another life update, by the way.

438
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,860
Another life update.

439
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,140
So, you know how the Minecraft...

440
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,380
Um... the Minecraft block wars thing that we're doing... By the way, I messed up my schedule.

441
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,320
It's at 11 a.m.

442
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,240
It's not 11 p.m.

443
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,400
I hope some people knew I messed up.

444
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,440
Because, like, you know, it's, like, the first stream of the day.

445
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,900
You know, the order is usually the first stream.

446
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,440
So, it's 11 a.m.

447
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,700
Not 11 p.m., by the way.

448
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,140
I fucked up on the schedule.

449
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,060
Um...

450
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,160
Anyway...

451
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,280
Um... So...

452
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,640
When we were... Gumi and I were in the call.

453
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,200
When we were in the call, she was like, hey, you know one of the players on our team?

454
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,340
Like, one of the pro Minecrafters on our team?

455
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,040
And I was like, yeah.

456
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,160
He was in the haunted house Twitch Rivals.

457
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,480
And I was like, oh, God.

458
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,080
He was there?

459
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,900
And she was like, yeah, but do you remember who he was?

460
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,400
And I was like, no.

461
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,960
He was one of the people that started that huge fight in the server.

462
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,420
And I was like, wait!

463
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,690
Because I was like, no, Gumi.

464
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,150
We roasted the shit out of him.

465
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,330
Oh, my God.

466
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,090
On stream.

467
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,690
In front of so many people.

468
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,810
And I was like, no way.

469
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,250
And she was like, no, he's on our team.

470
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,870
And I was like, do you think he remembers us?

471
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,690
Well, now he might remember us because I talked about it.

472
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,310
But I was like, no way.

473
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,330
He was the one that started the huge fucking fight.

474
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,890
Because like...

475
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,550
I'm like, no way.

476
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,230
And I was like, oh, my God.

477
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,450
I was like, Gumi, you don't understand.

478
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,850
We were...

479
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,830
We called them nerds, Gumi.

480
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,330
You don't understand.

481
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,610
There were so many people watching.

482
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,190
We called them nerds, Gumi.

483
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,170
We were roasting them.

484
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,890
He was like, the world will be okay.

485
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,770
Maybe he forgot.

486
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,670
I'm like, well, now he won't because I'm going to talk about it on stream.

487
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,750
Oh, my God.

488
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,270
So there's that, too.

489
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,790
There's so many consequences of my own actions today.

490
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,290
I can't believe every single act of karma is hitting me today.

491
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,810
Guys, everything is just hitting me today right now.

492
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,730
So there's that other update.

493
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,610
Finally, one last update.

494
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,490
Guys, this has nothing to do with my other life updates, but this showed...

495
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,370
Oh, wait, no, I do.

496
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,370
Actually, I do have one more.

497
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,010
A life update for my own life.

498
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,590
So, you know how dad...

499
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,550
By the way, dad's coming back later today.

500
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,670
So he's finally coming home.

501
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,150
I don't think he sees this as home anymore.

502
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,550
So, I got another text message from the babysitter yesterday.

503
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,990
I'm going to be loading screen real quick because I'm bringing up the text message because I was like...

504
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,110
I really wanted to text back.

505
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,190
Is this the same doc?

506
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,450
I wanted to text that back, but I didn't.

507
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:33,990
I held...

508
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,890
I tried to make sure I didn't say anything.

509
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,530
This is the message I got.

510
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,960
He hasn't barked at any other dogs he has seen during walks, too.

511
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,060
Very good behavior.

512
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,960
And I...

513
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,700
And I was...

514
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,880
And I'm just like...

515
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,820
I told you guys so many stories.

516
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,180
I told you!

517
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,180
For four days!

518
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,540
Four days!

519
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,420
This fucker has not barked at any other dogs!

520
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,840
For four fucking days!

521
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,320
Every time I walk him, I...

522
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,920
Who is he?

523
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,020
Who is he?

524
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,440
Who is he?

525
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,280
Who is he?

526
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,540
I can't be the problem!

527
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,420
What is she doing differently?

528
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,320
I don't understand!

529
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,980
What is she doing differently than me?

530
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,960
So...

531
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,500
So anyway, that's...

532
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,780
He's coming back.

533
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,700
I swear to God.

534
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,900
And I'm gonna walk him, and then he's gonna see a dog and he's gonna be like...

535
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,840
And I'll just be like... Who are you?

536
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,380
And I'm just gonna be like...

537
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,740
I swear to fucking God!

538
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
Don't you guys think... No!

539
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,040
He doesn't hate me!

540
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,680
He barks at other dogs, not me!

541
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,020
Thank you for the super chat.

542
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,540
Thank you.

543
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,240
Thank you.

544
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:15,880
Okay.

545
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,500
Anyway, one last update before...

546
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:18,880
I'm sorry.

547
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,760
There's been like...

548
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
A long tangent of life updates.

549
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,820
But this is, um...

550
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,120
One last update.

551
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,620
But basically, um...

552
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,600
Well, it's not an update.

553
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,620
I thought it was really funny.

554
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,360
So, Apex cheats are now pretty insane.

555
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,080
This actually popped up in my For You page, and I was like, the fuck?

556
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,400
So...

557
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:46,280
The hacks in Apex Legends has come so far that you can literally play an RTS in Apex via cheats.

558
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
And what do I mean by that?

559
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,220
So here is the link of what I saw today.

560
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,720
So, basically, um...

561
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,860
One cheater, one hacker figured out how to control five other players.

562
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,160
Five other bots.

563
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,360
And he controls these bots with the pinging system.

564
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,000
And these bots all have aimbot.

565
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,200
So I was blown away.

566
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,780
Cause I was like, wait, what?

567
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,640
Are they all, like, teaming together?

568
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,500
And then they started spectating the guy.

569
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,960
And he was literally playing a fucking RTS.

570
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,740
And so it was it was insane.

571
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,580
It was, it was literally playing an RTS in Apex Legends.

572
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,040
And was controlling them with the ping system.

573
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,760
And I'm like, oh my god.

574
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,660
Cheats have really come this far.

575
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,780
Like, a one man army with five fucking bots.

576
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,180
That's wild.

577
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,360
Like, dude, you just shattered Apex into pieces.

578
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,360
I was so funny.

579
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,180
I was like, who the fuck thought of that?

580
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,420
What the fuck?

581
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,100
Just not checkers.

582
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,260
Gotta respect their efforts.

583
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,860
Bro, one of them is, like, level 21 in Masters.

584
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,540
That guy literally got an account to level 20 and got to Masters in one level.

585
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,580
Like, that's so...

586
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,460
Oh my god.

587
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,480
I just couldn't believe it.

588
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,820
It blew...

589
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,340
I'm sorry.

590
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,780
It blew my mind that somebody actually made an RTS with Apex Legends.

591
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,140
I couldn't...

592
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,260
Cause, like, you know, the hacks I know.

593
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,880
The hacks...

594
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,300
The hacks I know.

595
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,600
You know, what happened to the classic aim botting and, like, aim botting and walls.

596
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,280
It's not... Like, you know, and then you're feeling a little spicy.

597
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,360
You add speed hack in there.

598
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,880
But now there's fucking RTS hacks?

599
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,260
Like, what?

600
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,440
Oh my god.

601
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,260
And then he has five of them.

602
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,320
He has five of them.

603
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,060
That's so crazy.

604
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,300
He's not even aim botting.

605
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,500
He's controlling a band of aim botters.

606
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,420
Okay.

607
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:25,860
Alright.

608
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,960
That is my...

609
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,000
That is my, like, life update of the day.

610
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,880
You're not even playing the same game anymore.

611
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,320
I know!

612
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,450
Oh my god.

613
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,110
Like...

614
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:49,130
It's so... So anyway, for those who want to see it, here's the link again for those who want to see the fucking impossible.

615
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,590
Um...

616
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,610
Thank you.

617
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,030
That is just being protective to you.

618
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,230
But, like, what about the other lady?

619
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,070
Alright.

620
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,130
Anyways, Dragon Ball Z time!

621
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,550
I am...

622
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,790
excited to try out the newest Dragon Ball Z game.

623
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,570
I think I talked about my... Oh my god.

624
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,150
Not Dutch.

625
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,330
I talked about my history with Dragon Ball Z.

626
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:14,770
Um...

627
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,170
And, um...

628
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,270
I watched Dragon Ball... Dragon Ball?

629
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,030
Dragon Ball Z?

630
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,990
Unfortunately, Dragon Ball GT.

631
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,570
Unfortunately.

632
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,950
It was on TV, okay guys?

633
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,530
I had nothing else to do.

634
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,270
Ocean Group dub is the most superior dub.

635
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,150
And, like, for those who are, like, you never even finish the series.

636
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,270
Um, that is a lie, because in Canada, we literally only had Ocean Group dub.

637
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,370
Like, don't fucking...

638
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,690
That's all we had!

639
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,530
That's literally...

640
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,570
That was literally all we had, okay?

641
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:48,730
Like...

642
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,690
And that... That's all the, um...

643
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,110
That's all the...

644
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,390
Uh...

645
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,350
Um... What anime I watched?

646
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,950
I didn't watch, like, Super or Kai.

647
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,090
I heard Super wasn't that great in terms of quality, but, like, I didn't watch Super or Kai.

648
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,550
I did, um...

649
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,770
Um, I watched... I remember watching a couple of the first move... couple of movies and everything.

650
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,430
Uh, so that is my experience on, um...

651
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,170
On Dragon Ball.

652
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,670
Um...

653
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,310
I like Dragon Ball.

654
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,830
I mean, what else can I say?

655
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,390
I like Dragon Ball, and I think Frieza seems like a really stand-up guy.

656
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,550
And maybe, you know, some of his philosophies...

657
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,750
is...

658
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:40,570
Wrong!

659
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,370
I don't know what you guys thought I was gonna say.

660
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,430
Like, I don't know.

661
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,390
I don't know what you guys thought I was gonna say, but, like...

662
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,130
That man did not like a lot of people.

663
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:52,450
Okay.

664
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,590
What do you mean, Doki?

665
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:57,950
No!

666
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,390
I said, some of his philosophies were wrong!

667
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,670
I don't know what you expected me to say.

668
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,930
Um, Angela, thank you for the super chat.

669
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,230
Thank you.

670
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:08,670
Thank you.

671
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,470
RIP to Doc Harris.

672
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,850
Never forget his time in Dragon Ball Z.

673
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,410
Some?

674
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,990
What do you mean, some?

675
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,430
Which one was right, Doki?

676
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,930
Some of his philosophies were wrong.

677
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,250
That's all I'll say.

678
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,950
That's all I'll say.

679
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,470
Alright.

680
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,350
Sound guy, are you around?

681
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,530
Okay, to be fair, Frieza has a really fucking good design.

682
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,230
Like, not the first one.

683
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,050
Which is the one where he's just, like, circles?

684
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,330
Like, not when he was in the... not when he was in that little car thing.

685
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,590
But, like, you know, the full... like, the perfect, the perfect, uh...

686
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,670
form.

687
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,710
His final form.

688
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,270
Yeah, yeah.

689
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,750
His final form was fucking sick.

690
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,290
Not so Deadpool.

691
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,150
Thank you for the super chat.

692
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:01,410
Thank you.

693
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:01,930
Thank you.

694
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,930
Cooler was better.

695
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,310
It was better than Frieza.

696
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,310
Thank you for the super chat.

697
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:06,630
Thank you.

698
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,210
Thank you.

699
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,070
Alright.

700
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,270
His last form.

701
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:10,610
Yeah.

702
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,550
Let's just boost everything to max.

703
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,750
Okay.

704
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,150
Put that...

705
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:16,910
We'll put 92.

706
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,690
I should have put this at 87.

707
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:23,650
Alright.

708
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,650
That should be good.

709
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:25,650
Alright.

710
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,490
Players can adjust controls.

711
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,130
Uh... Alright.

712
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:29,630
Continue.

713
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,930
Oh.

714
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,770
Fuck.

715
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,370
Um...

716
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,390
That's...

717
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,130
Oh, man.

718
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,130
That's a lot of words.

719
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:39,550
Okay.

720
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:41,990
That's...

721
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,730
Wow.

722
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,570
Okay.

723
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,930
I'm not gonna remember this, guys.

724
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,430
That's...

725
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:51,190
That's a lot of words on my screen right now.

726
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,190
So...

727
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,770
We'll see... Whoa.

728
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,930
What do any of these mean?

729
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,310
What do...

730
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,370
What do any of these things mean?

731
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,450
Combo assist.

732
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,530
Let's fucking go.

733
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,550
Help me.

734
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:05,550
Uh...

735
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,530
Follow up attack assist.

736
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,210
Let's go.

737
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,530
Dragon dash assist.

738
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,730
Oh, my gosh.

739
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,290
Let's...

740
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,110
Yeah.

741
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,190
Let's... This is...

742
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:14,730
Yeah.

743
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,110
Let's go.

744
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,990
Revenge counter assist.

745
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,570
Ooh.

746
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,130
Yeah.

747
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,930
Yeah.

748
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,650
Let's go.

749
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,810
I got this.

750
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,070
Oh, my God.

751
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,190
This is gonna be the easiest game of my life.

752
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,750
Oh, shit.

753
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,590
That looks cool.

754
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,470
That's sick.

755
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,200
I think Vegeta is better than Goku.

756
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,400
Oh, shit.

757
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,520
We're playing?

758
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,380
Oh, my God.

759
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,460
Is this my assist?

760
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,960
Is this...

761
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,340
Whoa.

762
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,160
Okay.

763
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,600
Jump.

764
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,120
Fly.

765
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,580
Am I flying?

766
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,700
Oh, no.

767
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,380
I'm flying now.

768
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:12,860
Okay.

769
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,480
L1 ascend to descend.

770
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,100
Oh, shit.

771
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,680
R2X.

772
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:20,860
Wait.

773
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,440
R2... Oh, wait.

774
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,960
That's not X.

775
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,700
Oh, I'm doing it.

776
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,300
Okay.

777
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,840
And then weeeeee.

778
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:28,860
Okay.

779
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,920
And then weeeeee.

780
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,400
All right.

781
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:30,880
There you go.

782
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,940
Thanks, Vegeta, for watching me.

783
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,660
Fun fact.

784
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,100
Frieza is based on the most evil person the creator ever met.

785
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,840
A 90's Japanese real estate agent.

786
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,840
Thank you for the Akasupa.

787
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,300
Thank you.

788
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:43,860
Thank you.

789
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,400
Okay.

790
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,240
And then...

791
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,120
All right.

792
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,340
Cool.

793
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,980
Why can't I just play Vegeta?

794
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,300
Oh, shit.

795
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,580
Nice.

796
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,320
This is so easy.

797
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,260
Nice.

798
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,140
And then Rush Chain.

799
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,340
Goodbye.

800
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:02,540
Bye.

801
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:06,920
Wait.

802
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,780
Is that not it?

803
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,660
Oh, it's a combo.

804
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,560
I thought it was pressing at the same time.

805
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,600
Okay.

806
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,760
Chi Blast.

807
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:18,840
Okay.

808
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,620
And then Chi Charge.

809
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,760
Or Ki Charge.

810
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,760
Oh, shit.

811
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,040
Wait.

812
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,340
No.

813
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,740
Stop.

814
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,040
Stop.

815
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,300
I'm trying to learn.

816
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,580
Where's my baby mode?

817
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,640
Stop.

818
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,960
Oh, my God.

819
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,060
Please.

820
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,260
Okay.

821
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,140
There we go.

822
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,320
Okay.

823
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,220
Activate and knock your opponent back.

824
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,760
Am I holding it?

825
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,640
Oh, by holding until fully charged.

826
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,080
Oh, hey.

827
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,080
Is he okay?

828
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,140
Is he gonna go on Twitter and type the response?

829
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,440
Wait.

830
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:51,940
He has to go?

831
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,660
Vegeta, please.

832
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,540
Where are you going?

833
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,680
Gonna go back to your fucking wife?

834
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:58,840
Okay.

835
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,040
What are you?

836
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,720
What?

837
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,080
Goku doesn't care?

838
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,660
I'm so surprised he even has kids at that point.

839
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,780
I'm just surprised Goku even has kids.

840
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,160
He does not give a fuck about Chi Chi sometimes.

841
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,880
He does not.

842
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,900
Oh, is this Superman opening?

843
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,180
Wait.

844
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,620
Not Superman.

845
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,700
I'm fucking not sorry.

846
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,180
I'm super...

847
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,880
Is this a super opening?

848
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,240
I don't know why is it Superman.

849
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,080
The opening looks really good.

850
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,480
Holy shit.

851
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,080
Is that Luffy from Hunter x Hunter?

852
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,680
Hunter x Hunter is coming back.

853
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,040
I heard.

854
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,540
Actually, thank you for the magenta soup.

855
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,240
Thank you.

856
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,780
Thank you.

857
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,220
That's crazy to say though.

858
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,620
Hunter x Hunter is coming back.

859
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,240
Yeah.

860
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,940
It's coming back in like...

861
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,480
I think.

862
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,340
I don't remember.

863
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,420
In like a couple of weeks or something.

864
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,420
Or it did come back already.

865
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,900
Wait.

866
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,780
It's only back for one chapter?

867
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,860
Oh.

868
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,300
That's fucked up.

869
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,260
That's like...

870
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,200
That...

871
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,280
If it's just for one chapter, it's a little...

872
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,140
It gives you like a taste of like...

873
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,600
What if I am coming back, JK?

874
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,400
Oh, 20 chapters?

875
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,020
Hey, that's great.

876
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,480
Access super training from the battle and training tab on the main menu.

877
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,280
Okay, cool.

878
00:34:59,480 --> 00:34:59,960
Okay.

879
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,880
I saw like... Oh, hey!

880
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,340
Those are the gods.

881
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,240
Oh, come forth.

882
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,400
I'm just gonna leave them now.

883
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,320
What does summoning them do?

884
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,620
Guys, I don't know if you guys noticed this, but...

885
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:11,960
Oh, hey!

886
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,620
It's Hercules!

887
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,600
I don't know if you guys know this.

888
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,840
Or Mr. Satan!

889
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,640
But like...

890
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,600
Um...

891
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,620
So I bought the deluxe.

892
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,240
Deluxe?

893
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,380
Cause I was like... Oh, it's only $10 more.

894
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,400
Like from the early access.

895
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,960
So I was like...

896
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,980
Oh, hey!

897
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,880
Um... Let's get all these things.

898
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,180
But like, what are they?

899
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,220
Like...

900
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,920
I'm just like... I saw like...

901
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,960
All the extra items and I'm like...

902
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,760
The fuck is all of this?

903
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,340
Like, I don't know what this does.

904
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,720
Like, what...

905
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,340
Summon Paranga?

906
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,940
Summon Supershed?

907
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,060
What do they give me?

908
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,640
What...

909
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,440
What do they give...

910
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,740
I don't even know.

911
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,140
Oh, are they like gotcha for characters?

912
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,020
What do you usually spend your time doing?

913
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,680
Oh, let's summon Shenron!

914
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,580
Let's do it!

915
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,720
Might as well have it.

916
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,540
It's gotcha time.

917
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,660
Shenron.

918
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,340
I want a pair of underwear.

919
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,980
I want more zeny.

920
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,260
I want more titles.

921
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,660
I want new outfits.

922
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,080
I want to raise my player level.

923
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Let's go gambling!

924
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,960
Which one's characters?

925
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:30,960
Guys.

926
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,140
Guys, which one is...

927
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,980
Which one is characters?

928
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:34,960
Guys.

929
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,540
The fuck is zeny?

930
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,880
Oh, zeny for...

931
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,340
The fuck is titles then?

932
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,600
Okay, zeny is characters.

933
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,680
Zeny is... Okay, zeny is money.

934
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,580
Oh yeah, it's the Dragon Ball Z money!

935
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,240
Sorry, I forgot.

936
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,740
It's the Dragon Ball Z money.

937
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,300
It's been a while.

938
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,320
Okay, so we'll get outfits then.

939
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,260
Uh, Sparx, thank you for the super chat.

940
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,240
Your very first super chat.

941
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,540
Thank you.

942
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,100
Thank you.

943
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,880
The beginning of Dragon Ball Super ranges from bad to meh, but it gets better when a tournament destroys... Oh yeah!

944
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,640
The only thing I know about...

945
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,100
The only thing I know about...

946
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,200
Can I just leave?

947
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,760
And like... Oh my god, I'm worried that if I just be like JK...

948
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,240
I'm worried that if I say JK, they'll be like, well, you already used your Dragon Ball.

949
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,260
Okay, I swear to god if he was like, well, you already used it, so... Guess not.

950
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,880
Guess no wish for you.

951
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:33,960
No...

952
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:39,020
The only thing I know about Dragon Ball Super was, uh...

953
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,340
was from the World Destroyer...

954
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,320
the turn... like the tournament destroyer's arc, where they're trying to destroy...

955
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,540
The fuck is that?

956
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,240
Is this from Super?

957
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,000
Like, what the fuck is that?

958
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,440
Don't they remember from Shenron?

959
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,200
It's the ultra buff Shenron!

960
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,080
And the...

961
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,800
Is that from Super?

962
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,160
Like, Super the... Bro, what the fuck is wrong with his face?

963
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,760
Okay, I want more characters.

964
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,680
Um...

965
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,680
Oh, shit.

966
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,980
Oh my god, which one?

967
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,700
Which is best?

968
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,540
Fused Zamasu or Goku Black or Evil Goku?

969
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,520
He's beautiful!

970
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,860
Is Goku Black better?

971
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,960
Or Fused Zamasu?

972
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,940
He went super safe.

973
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,200
Goku Black is cooler.

974
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,560
Because he has black in his name.

975
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,960
Alright, Goku Black.

976
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,280
Wish your...

977
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,240
girl...

978
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,820
Yay!

979
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,820
I got Goku Black!

980
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,160
Good luck with... Oh, I heard Great Ape Vegeta is, like, pretty difficult.

981
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh, nice!

982
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,540
Alright, let's summon Shenron.

983
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,400
What the fuck?

984
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,500
I missed out so much on the newer Dragon Ball.

985
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,340
Alright, let's get outfits.

986
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,560
Yeah, he's messing everybody up.

987
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,980
I want new outfits.

988
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:11,540
Oh!

989
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,000
Wait, I want a Vegeta... Wait, what's the Vegeta Super outfit?

990
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,680
Wait, which outfit do I get?

991
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,180
Vegeta Super outfit?

992
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,260
Master Roshi outfit?

993
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,880
Okay, we don't... I don't... Who the fuck would pick Yamcha?

994
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,120
That's all I'm gonna say.

995
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,020
I'm not gonna get a Yamcha outfit.

996
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,840
Who the fuck is gonna pick...

997
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,940
Who even... Who willingly plays Yamcha?

998
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,720
Like, who fucking willingly plays that character?

999
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,220
But it's Yamcha.

1000
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,480
Don't say that!

1001
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,000
Lots of people.

1002
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,560
Yamcha's the real one.

1003
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,140
It's like you're asking to lose.

1004
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,680
Like, why the fuck would you play Yamcha?

1005
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,180
It's not... This is like...

1006
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,580
This is like Yamcha with like 500 bots or some shit.

1007
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,020
He is the second strongest actor Mr. Satan.

1008
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,300
The Yamcha difficulty for gamers.

1009
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,360
Okay.

1010
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,600
Um...

1011
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,960
I'm gonna get the...

1012
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,060
Alright, just for... Just...

1013
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,920
Okay, Yamcha.

1014
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,900
You and your 500 bots, I'll get a Yamcha outfit.

1015
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,300
Me, I play Yamcha.

1016
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,800
Oh my god, it's so...

1017
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,140
Oh, it's the Dragon Ball outfit.

1018
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,150
Wait, is it right now?

1019
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,790
Oh, okay.

1020
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,730
Maintain notice.

1021
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,090
Okay, I was gonna say I swear to god, I cannot not play now.

1022
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,810
Okay, what is...

1023
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,550
Alright.

1024
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,030
Battle...

1025
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,530
Do we do episode?

1026
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,230
I guess it's episode, right?

1027
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,910
Oh wait, I wanna...

1028
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,130
I wanna...

1029
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,490
Turn... Alright, guys.

1030
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,190
Uh...

1031
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,930
Sound guy, is there anything I need to fix?

1032
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,490
Sound guy?

1033
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,370
Alright, guys.

1034
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,170
Because I saw you guys were yelling at me.

1035
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,870
And was like, please don't do this to us.

1036
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,870
But I still wanna hit.

1037
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,550
Okay.

1038
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:37,730
Alright.

1039
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,570
I didn't just bring up the sound effects.

1040
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,190
Okay, I'll bring... I love the menu so far.

1041
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,290
The menu is really pretty.

1042
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,630
I think.

1043
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:52,910
Funny fact that what I've heard, Trunks' English voice actor couldn't stop laughing on the line, Hold your fire, that...

1044
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:53,890
What?

1045
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,230
Wait.

1046
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:57,830
Wait.

1047
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,450
Is that a real line?

1048
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,390
No way.

1049
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:05,910
Wait.

1050
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,790
No fucking way.

1051
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,140
How did...

1052
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,220
How did that...

1053
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,680
How did that even get through approval?

1054
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,440
No, I have to be Goku?

1055
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,700
A warrior who is constantly in search of new...

1056
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,040
Oh my god!

1057
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,660
That's racist!

1058
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,620
Oh wait, am I going straight in?

1059
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,620
Oh, this is the movie!

1060
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,320
This is when he kidnaps my son!

1061
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,660
I already forgot how to play this game.

1062
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,420
Oh shit, don't worry!

1063
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,220
There's my son!

1064
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,580
Wait, he's not?

1065
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,500
Oh my god, I'm so fucking stupid!

1066
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,360
Get over here!

1067
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:29,900
Get over here!

1068
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,900
That's fucking right!

1069
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,900
What you gonna do, huh?

1070
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,660
That's fucking right!

1071
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,160
Wait, he's not from a movie?

1072
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,920
No, there's... wasn't there a movie with this?

1073
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,220
Or is that in Canada?

1074
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,180
Guys, the worst part, I watched it all in syndication.

1075
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,980
So like, it was mostly from like...

1076
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,360
So it was so out of order.

1077
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,060
By the way, I watched Dragon Ball Z out of order.

1078
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,100
Because I only watched it whenever it like came up on my TV.

1079
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,000
Like...

1080
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,840
I didn't even know it was episode 1.

1081
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,760
Because I literally...

1082
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,760
It was so out of order.

1083
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,480
I thought it was a movie.

1084
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,540
It was part...

1085
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,580
God, I'm...

1086
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,060
There were so many movies.

1087
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,060
Okay, let me beat you up.

1088
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,280
No!

1089
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,460
Please!

1090
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,180
I forgot the moves!

1091
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,740
Oh yeah, 100%.

1092
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,900
YTV fucking sucked.

1093
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,640
That's literally how I watched the show.

1094
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,500
Okay, come on.

1095
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,840
Get over here!

1096
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,320
I only know how to square properly!

1097
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,540
Okay, and this too.

1098
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,200
And I know how to do that.

1099
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,110
Yeah, the movie you're thinking of is the ocean version of The Arrival.

1100
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,310
Which is like 2-3 episodes cut up and made...

1101
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:04,650
Yeah!

1102
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,990
No, I was right!

1103
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,030
I was right!

1104
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,410
They made it into a movie on ocean group dub!

1105
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,590
I fucking knew it!

1106
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,490
I fucking...

1107
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,570
You guys tried to gaslight me.

1108
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,590
You guys actually tried to gaslight...

1109
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,830
It was a Canadian...

1110
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,570
I fucking...

1111
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,030
I fucking knew it!

1112
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,270
Vindication!

1113
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,470
Fucking vindication!

1114
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,650
If you want your little brat to return safely, Kakarot.

1115
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,190
Prove your Saiyan spirit.

1116
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:41,090
Eliminate 100 earthlings and pile them here before I return in one day.

1117
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:42,190
No!

1118
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:43,410
My son!

1119
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,610
And let me be very clear about this.

1120
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,350
What's wrong with you, Canada?

1121
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,850
I come back and I don't see 100 corpses.

1122
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,050
I killed the kid.

1123
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,810
Oh, he didn't specify human corpses.

1124
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,470
It could be anything else.

1125
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,170
What even is Canada?

1126
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,930
A pixel welcome to the tomato farm.

1127
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:06,430
Come on!

1128
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,070
I didn't even recognize him as my son.

1129
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:09,870
Why would I care?

1130
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,570
Oh wait, that's...

1131
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,290
Sorry.

1132
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,810
My Frieza in me is talking.

1133
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,010
I forgot Goku cares.

1134
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,190
Goku is no match for Raditz overwhelming strength.

1135
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,970
And Raditz successfully kidnapped Gohan.

1136
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,290
However...

1137
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,790
He is then treated to an unexpected reunion.

1138
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:31,250
Piccolo!

1139
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,410
Piccolo?

1140
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,930
Yeah, Piccolo!

1141
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,670
But what are you doing here?

1142
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,350
I was pursuing him.

1143
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:47,290
As much as I'd like to kill the wretch myself.

1144
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,430
The sad truth is I have a better shot at that.

1145
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,630
If you were along for the ride.

1146
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,090
Hold on.

1147
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,010
You mean team up with me?

1148
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,130
Why in the world would you ever do that?

1149
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,790
Because I came from the future.

1150
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,270
We're gonna be best friends.

1151
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,450
This would just be a temporary alliance.

1152
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:06,210
Only for the sake of eradicating that alien off my planet.

1153
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,030
Yeah, temporary for like 80 more years, I guess.

1154
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,470
Once that purpose has been served, I'll keep my promise to Koshin.

1155
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,610
Honestly, he's a better father than Goku could ever be.

1156
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,650
I think Goku should not...

1157
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:22,750
Goku...

1158
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,010
Oh, wait.

1159
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,890
I can work with Piccolo?

1160
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,930
Or go at it alone?

1161
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:27,950
Oh my god!

1162
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,350
This is like the what-if scenario!

1163
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,010
This is the what-if!

1164
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,370
I'm gonna do it alone.

1165
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:34,150
I don't...

1166
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,190
I wonder what happens if I go alone.

1167
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:40,990
Yeah!

1168
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,550
I'm gonna do it alone.

1169
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,570
No, don't perpetuate the stereotype.

1170
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,210
We don't need you, Piccolo!

1171
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,010
We don't need you!

1172
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,730
Gohan's gonna recognize me as Piccolo!

1173
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:53,650
This is real father!

1174
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,830
Whatever you say.

1175
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:00,530
That's right.

1176
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:03,210
You might have taken my son now!

1177
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:04,350
But...

1178
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,590
Goku, watch yourself and keep calm.

1179
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:08,750
We all know you can do this.

1180
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,130
Go away!

1181
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,630
I'm gonna solo him.

1182
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,530
Let me come with you.

1183
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,590
The three of us together could whip that guy easy.

1184
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,050
Yeah, I don't need Piccolo.

1185
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,530
I have fucking Krillin.

1186
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:23,790
I have a human.

1187
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:27,190
But you've already been brought back to life by Shenron once before.

1188
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:27,650
Oh shit.

1189
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,170
Goku's like, Krillin, you're gonna fucking die.

1190
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,610
I don't wanna do that again.

1191
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,410
Maybe so.

1192
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,070
But don't let yourself get killed, Goku.

1193
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,610
Or we're all dead.

1194
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,030
Master Roshi's right.

1195
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,250
If I die, you have Piccolo!

1196
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:46,610
Krillin.

1197
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,170
Master Roshi.

1198
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,990
Gohan is now fatherless.

1199
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:50,170
You're the best.

1200
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:50,710
No.

1201
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,170
I'm gonna win this, guys.

1202
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,510
I can solo him.

1203
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,650
I literally almost killed Raditz.

1204
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,790
Also, thank you, Marshall, for vindicating me.

1205
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:03,970
And also, Dango.

1206
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:11,270
Yeah!

1207
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,650
Not the tracker.

1208
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:15,970
Piccolo's like the babysitter.

1209
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,070
Dango, thank you for the super chat.

1210
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:18,410
Thank you.

1211
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:18,810
Thank you.

1212
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:22,650
Wonder Woman!

1213
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:23,690
Let's follow them!

1214
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,590
Bloom, yes, thank you for the super chat!

1215
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:28,870
Thank you!

1216
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:36,590
Fun fact, but in the Dragon Ball Super anime, Goku confirms he never kissed his wife, which can imply he's- No, he has!

1217
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:39,950
Cause, what other Saiyan would it be?!

1218
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:44,930
Like, they're literally half-Saiyan, so like, it had to be him!

1219
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,510
So, like, he just...

1220
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:48,450
I don't know.

1221
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:49,290
Hahaha!

1222
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:59,150
I don't know how it happened, but I just I guess I Guess he never kissed it wasn't love

1223
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:29,270
His emotional and mental IQ is definitely not an adult

1224
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:40,290
I don't think he knows how to process the human world

1225
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:52,710
I don't think he knows how to process the human world I don't even think he knows how to tie his shoelace, Raddus.

1226
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:58,530
Please, I don't think Goku can even tie his shoelace.

1227
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,230
Like, I don't...

1228
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,050
But he's not even wearing shoes!

1229
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,150
What am I saying?

1230
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:10,030
He's not even wearing... I don't even think he knows he betrayed anybody!

1231
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,790
He's literally not even wearing shoes!

1232
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,430
Oh, guys, why didn't I...

1233
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,510
Guys, why didn't I ask Goku Piccolo to help?

1234
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:21,030
Guys!

1235
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,030
Oh my god.

1236
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,070
It's fine.

1237
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,910
We'll be fine.

1238
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:30,150
We're gonna be so fine.

1239
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:31,190
We're...

1240
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,750
Oh god, okay, we're gonna be... guys, there's no way.

1241
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:37,070
We can't fuck this up.

1242
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,930
Oh, I can have Solar Flare!

1243
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,870
Oh shit, no, that's not the right move.

1244
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,550
I forgot Solar Flare was like Flashbang.

1245
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,410
Oh, I bought that ball!

1246
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:47,090
I bought that ball!

1247
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:50,550
Okay.

1248
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:51,890
Nice.

1249
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:52,930
Oh, what the fuck?

1250
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:53,710
Why are you so good?

1251
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,690
I'm not even wearing shoes!

1252
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:57,730
Nice.

1253
00:51:59,390 --> 00:51:59,830
Okay.

1254
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:01,210
Yes!

1255
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,390
I got the Solar Flare.

1256
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:03,210
But he jumped?

1257
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,190
That should be cheating!

1258
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:07,450
Okay.

1259
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,390
Piccolo, why are you watching?

1260
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:18,190
I don't need you, Piccolo!

1261
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,510
I don't need you!

1262
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,110
I can do this without you!

1263
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:24,750
Okay.

1264
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,410
That's fine.

1265
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:27,150
That's fine.

1266
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,490
Oh shit.

1267
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,630
Don't worry, I got this.

1268
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:34,290
See, I'm so much better!

1269
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,050
I told you I could solo him!

1270
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:39,470
I don't know what I'm doing, but I knew it!

1271
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:41,610
That's right.

1272
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,810
What's going on?

1273
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:44,510
What am I doing?

1274
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:48,310
I did it!

1275
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,290
I did

1276
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,140
it!

1277
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,300
Yeah!

1278
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,920
I don't know what I did.

1279
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,920
I don't know what I...

1280
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,280
Say goodbye, Kakarot!

1281
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,260
Wait, what?

1282
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,720
But it showed I did it!

1283
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,500
Oh shit, crazy Gohan!

1284
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,580
How did I level 1,307?

1285
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,680
Don't hurt my...

1286
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,910
How did I...

1287
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,830
How did I win but lose?

1288
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,050
Oh yeah, he has a higher power level.

1289
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,110
And then I got jealous.

1290
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,190
And then I got a better power level after that.

1291
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,130
I can't let my son be stronger than me.

1292
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,020
Yeah, I was like 1,307?

1293
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,100
No, stop!

1294
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,140
Don't do it!

1295
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:46,960
Please!

1296
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:47,820
He's just a...

1297
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,200
Just a child?

1298
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,960
Is that what you were going to say, Kakarot?

1299
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,020
Don't worry, brother.

1300
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,280
I failed the what if?

1301
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,240
In the next world!

1302
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,040
I didn't win fast enough!

1303
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,560
But he was so strong!

1304
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:03,380
No!

1305
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,280
Oh, thank God, I'm going to die.

1306
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,080
Maybe I can play Vegeta.

1307
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,980
It's the only way to beat you!

1308
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1309
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,240
No!

1310
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,600
Not the cannon event!

1311
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,480
Do it!

1312
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,680
No!

1313
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,540
Stop!

1314
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,140
Special beam cannon!

1315
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,380
I just threw a fucking...

1316
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,580
Oh shit!

1317
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,060
Okay, goodbye.

1318
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,940
It's alright, we'll just find the Dragon Balls for the, like, 150th time.

1319
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,140
Wait,

1320
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,620
what's the alternate event?

1321
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,660
You can all go to hell.

1322
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,780
Still, I thank you for the information.

1323
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,520
Everything that has happened here today...

1324
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,360
Wait, R3?

1325
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,760
...has been transmitted.

1326
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,300
Oh shit!

1327
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:05,480
I'm just like, hey Piccolo, I'm sort of still alive if you want to come over here and...

1328
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,620
When they've learned that I've been killed...

1329
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,320
I'm still...

1330
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,580
I'm still sort of alive, Piccolo, if you want to come over here...

1331
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:11,720
I...

1332
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:12,820
I...

1333
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,660
The other...

1334
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,120
Two Saiyans...

1335
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,280
When...

1336
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,900
When will they arrive here?

1337
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,080
How long?

1338
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,620
One year.

1339
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,200
One year.

1340
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,220
Just one short year.

1341
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,080
Prince Vegeta's coming.

1342
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,720
Just one short year.

1343
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,520
Oh no.

1344
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,640
My eyes.

1345
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,700
Piccolo, please!

1346
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,100
Babe, you don't need the Dragon Ball!

1347
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,120
Please, Piccolo, take me to the fuck?

1348
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,020
Give me the bean!

1349
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,000
Give me the bean!

1350
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,020
How sweet is that victory taste now?

1351
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,380
They're going to wipe you...

1352
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,700
all out.

1353
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:49,780
They'll...

1354
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,480
Soon...

1355
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:50,640
Have you...

1356
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,440
Give me the Senju Bean, Piccolo!

1357
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,100
Do you have the어 I'm still alive!

1358
00:55:59,360 --> 00:55:59,820
Oh shit.

1359
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,520
No beats.

1360
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,240
Oh, there he is.

1361
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,640
Oh, it's already there?

1362
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,740
That person, thank you for the 10 gifted ships!

1363
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,780
Thank you, thank you!

1364
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,240
I can't believe I was too slow to unlock the alternate route!

1365
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,840
After Goku perishes in the battle with Raditz, as just as Raditz said, within a year, the two Saiyans came to Earth.

1366
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:33,360
Finally, having completed his training on King Kai's planet, Goku is revived by the Dragon Balls and returned once more to the battlefield.

1367
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,580
Oh no, the Cybermen.

1368
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,740
I heard people are naming Cybermen just to piss people off.

1369
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:49,880
Unable to escape, the Yamcha dies in an explosion induced by the self-destructing weapon, the Saiyans.

1370
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,460
Oh my god, Yamcha.

1371
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,460
Yamcha, no!

1372
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,980
Him and his one fan.

1373
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,360
One bi- His one fan with 500 alternate accounts.

1374
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:07,000
Just when all hope seems to be lost, Goku arrives on the scene.

1375
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:16,140
How's it feel, seeing your little friend's corpse has scattered all over?

1376
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:21,080
There was another one, but there's probably not a scrap of him left.

1377
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,240
Piccolo's gone.

1378
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,500
I say nonchalantly.

1379
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,600
What, you gonna- I mean, I'm just like, well, I could just wish him back.

1380
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,340
Being dead doesn't even have real consequences anymore to these guys.

1381
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,360
They're like, oh, he's dead.

1382
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,300
Let me just wish him back to life.

1383
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,480
That stupid look on your face just makes me want to kill you faster.

1384
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,920
You'll pay for this!

1385
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,400
You'll both pay!

1386
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,240
You bastards!

1387
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,000
Vegeta, what does this power of love for say?

1388
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,200
Oh, okay, not yet.

1389
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,280
Wait, what do I do?

1390
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,180
What?

1391
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,120
Oh, this again!

1392
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,360
Oh, my god, he set the thing!

1393
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,040
Set the thing!

1394
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,020
Holy shit, he set the thing, guys!

1395
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:19,780
Hahaha.

1396
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:21,740
Hahaha.

1397
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,220
That's right, Nappa, get over here.

1398
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,740
Get your ass over here.

1399
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,660
I know only two moves, and that's enough moves for me.

1400
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,340
That's fucking right!

1401
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,220
Let's go!

1402
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:31,720
Oh, shit!

1403
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,860
Okay, not like that, though.

1404
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,080
Oh, nice!

1405
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,640
I countered!

1406
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,320
Oh, fuck!

1407
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:37,680
Okay.

1408
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,640
That's fine.

1409
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,820
I figured it out.

1410
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,280
That's fucking right.

1411
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,120
Soul Affair!

1412
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:48,580
I'm so great!

1413
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,400
Okay.

1414
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:51,940
Oh, what's that?

1415
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,460
What's that?

1416
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:52,900
What's he doing?

1417
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,400
What's he doing?

1418
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,460
Oh, he missed!

1419
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,280
I don't think he missed, though.

1420
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,020
Wait, what is he doing?

1421
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,280
What is that?

1422
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1423
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,000
No, that dot!

1424
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,140
No!

1425
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,600
I didn't know what he's doing!

1426
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,820
Okay, that's fine.

1427
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,280
Me and my two moves!

1428
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,760
Square, square, triangle!

1429
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,980
It has not failed me yet!

1430
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,560
Triangle time!

1431
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:20,620
Oh, shit!

1432
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,660
He's slapping them away!

1433
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,960
He's charging.

1434
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,780
Oh, he's charging!

1435
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:27,900
We did it!

1436
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,560
The two moves!

1437
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,960
I did it!

1438
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,040
Yeah, that's Vegeta's technique!

1439
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,200
I only know Vegeta's technique!

1440
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,520
Square, square...

1441
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,740
Square, square, square, triangle!

1442
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,560
Do you know how to use your I.A.M.

1443
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:46,680
specials?

1444
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:50,880
Vegeta!

1445
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,180
No!

1446
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:53,680
Weak!

1447
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,160
I'm sorry, Nappa.

1448
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,560
I have no use for a paralyzed Saiyan!

1449
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,060
Oh, shit!

1450
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,400
Vegeta, that's fucked!

1451
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,080
You're dead white!

1452
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:04,700
Oh!

1453
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,040
Vegeta!

1454
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,180
Just don't get paralyzed!

1455
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,600
It's that easy!

1456
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,100
He's a psycho!

1457
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:17,160
He just killed his own partner for no reason!

1458
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,480
This is the Saiyan way, Krillin!

1459
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,220
You don't understand!

1460
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,450
Weakness is not allowed in the Saiyans!

1461
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,080
Now he's just dead.

1462
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,580
I thought Vegeta was your favorite and that's why I...

1463
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,920
You saw what that other Saiyan can do?

1464
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,740
If we stick around, we'll only be getting in your dad's way!

1465
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:38,980
Sorry, Gohan.

1466
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,500
This guy's stronger than I thought he'd be.

1467
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,020
Yeah?

1468
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,220
And?

1469
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:46,820
What?

1470
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:47,560
Did I say it?

1471
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:09,540
I'm not good at doing this.

1472
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,240
Okay, I can't do this anymore.

1473
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:11,340
This is gonna be too much.

1474
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:11,540
Okay, that's not it.

1475
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:15,840
I'm done.

1476
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,220
I'm done!

1477
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:43,960
He literally blew up planets, so like, that's all I'm saying.

1478
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,060
He did change.

1479
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:57,720
Every once in a while, they would do an episode where they're like, Vegeta suddenly turns evil.

1480
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,880
And like, turns evil again.

1481
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,000
You should feel lucky.

1482
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,680
Not every low class warrior gets the chance to spar with a super elite like myself.

1483
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,160
Not long after Saiyans are born, their skills as a soldier are tested.

1484
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:22,120
The scum whose scores are ranked the lowest are sent to the outer worlds.

1485
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,520
Doesn't turn evil, he just doesn't care.

1486
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,620
Isn't that worse?

1487
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,860
That's... isn't that just like... being a psychopath when they don't care?

1488
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,400
I think it is worse.

1489
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:40,420
You don't get it.

1490
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,420
I can fix him.

1491
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:43,640
Yes.

1492
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,600
And as a result, I was lucky enough to come here to Earth.

1493
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,280
I'm grateful for that.

1494
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,880
Besides, even a lower class outcast can surpass an elite if he puts his mind to it.

1495
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:55,980
Yeah.

1496
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,160
Practice makes perfect.

1497
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,780
Determination, Vegeta.

1498
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:02,120
I didn't get handed everything to me.

1499
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,480
You're just a spoiled little brat.

1500
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,520
You have a fucking silver spoon stuck in your ass.

1501
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:12,900
Now let me show you a wall that you will never have the ability to scale through ever alone.

1502
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,160
Oh shit, is this when he turns into a giant monkey?

1503
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,600
I'm sorry.

1504
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:24,200
I know I should stop saying monkey.

1505
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,100
I'm so sorry.

1506
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,240
Doki, no!

1507
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:34,540
Okay.

1508
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,580
Wait a minute, spoiler.

1509
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,920
I fucking watched the show.

1510
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,960
Don't worry, I will use your moves against you!

1511
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:48,720
My square-square-triangle move will never fail me!

1512
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,120
That's fucking right!

1513
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,100
Triangle!

1514
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:57,820
Yes!

1515
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:02,970
Don't worry!

1516
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,090
Butch, don't know how to counter this!

1517
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:10,930
Butch, sorry.

1518
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:12,670
Oh shit.

1519
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:13,350
Oh, Galaga.

1520
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:13,610
No.

1521
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,070
Oh god.

1522
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,490
Okay.

1523
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,010
Oh fuck.

1524
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,070
How do I...

1525
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,550
No, I can't dodge that!

1526
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:22,410
Oh no, he's coming in.

1527
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:23,270
No!

1528
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,030
There we go, I got him.

1529
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:27,590
Bro, you're blocking?

1530
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:30,190
Who the fuck taught you how to block?

1531
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:31,750
Nice.

1532
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:32,510
That's fucking right.

1533
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:34,310
Oh god.

1534
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:35,730
That's fucking right.

1535
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:36,550
Try that again, bitch.

1536
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:37,770
That's right.

1537
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:38,590
Try that.

1538
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,630
Oh, you're gonna keep blocking?

1539
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:41,790
Try that again.

1540
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,430
Oh shit, he didn't try.

1541
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:47,730
Look at that.

1542
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:48,990
That's fucking right.

1543
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,370
Oh wait, he's still trying to...

1544
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:53,570
Alright, don't worry, I can do that.

1545
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,490
Do I keep doing that?

1546
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,270
That's right.

1547
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:56,050
Do I keep doing that?

1548
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:56,410
Oh.

1549
01:04:56,890 --> 01:04:57,290
JK.

1550
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:58,430
JK.

1551
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:00,830
There we go.

1552
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:01,930
That's right.

1553
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:02,350
Oh!

1554
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:03,870
Yeah, that's right!

1555
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:04,290
Do it again!

1556
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:05,430
Do it again!

1557
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,270
Oh, bitch!

1558
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:11,110
Oh no!

1559
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,110
No!

1560
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:13,590
I'm sorry!

1561
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,630
I'm so sorry!

1562
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:17,610
Ha ha ha!

1563
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:20,970
That's okay.

1564
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:23,590
Fucking didn't learn.

1565
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:26,430
And the cheese.

1566
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,090
He's getting cooked.

1567
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,090
Lexi.

1568
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,290
Oh, I saw that episode!

1569
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:36,490
I saw that!

1570
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,790
I remember cause I like the ocean dub.

1571
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:42,250
I thought it was really interesting.

1572
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:42,950
Lexi.

1573
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:43,730
They give a super chat.

1574
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:44,550
Thank you, thank you.

1575
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:45,710
Okay, now.

1576
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,050
Now... then what?

1577
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:54,210
Okay, what is like... I just called him a giant... giant... okay, ape?

1578
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:55,030
Is that better?

1579
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:56,690
I'm sorry.

1580
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:00,850
Vegeta was hit.

1581
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:03,410
Goku can still sense a trace of his ki-chi remaining.

1582
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:07,830
Yajirobe... oh my god, Yajirobe sounds like that guy from regular show.

1583
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:11,530
Emerged from his hiding place, but Goku instructs him to flee.

1584
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:14,830
Sure enough, Vegeta rises once more.

1585
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:15,190
Ready?

1586
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,630
To... challenge Goku again.

1587
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:20,830
Goku believes his only chance for victory is to use the Spirit Bomb.

1588
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,950
Yeah, he sounds like Muscle Man.

1589
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:29,550
However, Vegeta has a secret technique known only to Saiyans up to his sleeves.

1590
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,200
What was that?

1591
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:39,300
Oh!

1592
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:40,860
It's time!

1593
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,880
He's gonna turn into a giant ape!

1594
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,260
Guys, I went to my HR sensitivity training class.

1595
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,940
That Frieza put me through.

1596
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:58,120
Because the Frieza army is filled with Saiyans, I had to go to sensitivity training.

1597
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:01,640
And now I know that we have to call them Great Apes.

1598
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,080
This is not fair!

1599
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,300
He's like... six times my size!

1600
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,940
He turned into a giant monkey!

1601
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,260
Okay!

1602
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,140
So, Goku...

1603
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:43,000
Oh, just cause he's... okay.

1604
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:45,960
Oh, hey, Muscle Man.

1605
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,220
He can say it!

1606
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:59,640
The only choice now is to gather energy from all over the Earth!

1607
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,240
To make a Spirit Bomb!

1608
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,300
It's the same thing, Doki.

1609
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,200
There's nothing completely new about this!

1610
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:11,360
It's a ghost!

1611
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:11,760
Oh shit!

1612
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:12,500
Oh no!

1613
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,700
What the fuck?!

1614
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,180
Hada, what the fuck?

1615
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,180
Oh my g— I can't even...

1616
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:19,980
Oh, I can't...

1617
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,040
Like, what do I look at?!

1618
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:22,920
HAHAHA!

1619
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,440
What the fuck?!

1620
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,300
Oh my god!

1621
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:30,580
Like, what the fuck do I even look at?!

1622
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:34,340
Like, holy fuck!

1623
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,940
Like, I don't even... what the fuck?!

1624
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:44,040
Oh my god, everything!

1625
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:49,060
I'm looking at his fucking crotch.

1626
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,280
Bro, like, this is bullshit!

1627
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:56,660
Like, oh my... no, what?

1628
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,400
I'm just gonna punch him in the fucking crotch, I guess.

1629
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:00,420
Like...

1630
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,260
Wait, did I?

1631
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,140
Oh, I dodged?

1632
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:06,400
Nice.

1633
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,100
Oh shit.

1634
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,200
Oh my god!

1635
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,580
Oh my god, please!

1636
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,920
Oh my god!

1637
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,340
No wonder!

1638
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,120
What the fuck?!

1639
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,580
Oh my god!

1640
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,400
Bro!

1641
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,880
I'm just... I'm so confused!

1642
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,160
I'm so confused!

1643
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,600
Wait, they're not... No!

1644
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:39,000
I have vacancy!

1645
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,000
Oh my god!

1646
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,800
Okay, alright.

1647
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,660
This is... goodbye.

1648
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:48,980
Is this a what if?

1649
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,260
Well, and then I guess we lost.

1650
01:09:54,380 --> 01:10:01,700
With all the remaining warriors of Earth also defeated, the planet comes after... comes under Vegeta's tyrannical control.

1651
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,480
Okay, am I retry on normal?

1652
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:05,940
Okay, I'm on normal.

1653
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,660
Oh my god!

1654
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,580
What the...

1655
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:11,900
No!

1656
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,200
What the...

1657
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,280
It was me!

1658
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:18,900
Yeah!

1659
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,800
You're a monster!

1660
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,100
Oh shit!

1661
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,180
Wait, can I just do this?

1662
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,360
That's good.

1663
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:31,880
That's good.

1664
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,700
Oh my god!

1665
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:34,760
I... Oh!

1666
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:36,480
Shit!

1667
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:37,680
No!

1668
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,400
Goku, if you die, everything is over!

1669
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:43,840
Please!

1670
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,440
Please!

1671
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,660
I might as well be done!

1672
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,700
Oh my god!

1673
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,600
I can't... I can't...

1674
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:01,640
This guy... No wonder... Oh my... Okay, now I understand why so many people... How do I...

1675
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,540
How do I do anything?

1676
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,640
Jesus Christ!

1677
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:11,460
I'm just going full power spamming.

1678
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:13,820
If you don't, you literally... What the...

1679
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,380
What the fuck is that bullshit?

1680
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,320
Oh my god, Vegeta.

1681
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,200
This is why I wish I was playing Vegeta.

1682
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,260
This is exactly why.

1683
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,900
Okay, we'll try that.

1684
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:23,820
How do I... Okay.

1685
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,700
Okay, retry.

1686
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,660
Oh my god.

1687
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,640
Guys, okay.

1688
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,180
Explanation of controls.

1689
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,260
Okay, alright.

1690
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:41,700
R2 square.

1691
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:42,780
Okay, we got this.

1692
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,580
Okay, fly time.

1693
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,160
Oh my god, please.

1694
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,740
Please, I can't even get up.

1695
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,280
Please.

1696
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,160
No!

1697
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,460
Let me fly!

1698
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,300
Get me out of here!

1699
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:02,980
Get in!

1700
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,180
Oh my god!

1701
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,760
Get in here!

1702
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,420
I'll see you in the next one!

1703
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:12,620
There's no way!

1704
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,360
At least I'll get to apologize to you!

1705
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:15,720
Kamehameha!

1706
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,600
Get out!

1707
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,660
That's right.

1708
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,260
Oh shit, I'm sorry!

1709
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:25,980
Me first.

1710
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,380
Oh, you're a fucker.

1711
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,920
You're actually a fucker.

1712
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,440
You're actually a fucker.

1713
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,120
No!

1714
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,980
He got me down!

1715
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,600
He swatted me like a fucking fly!

1716
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,700
Holy shit!

1717
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,840
You're not supposed to do that!

1718
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,180
Oh my god!

1719
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:50,040
Guys, what do you mean I have to attack him after?

1720
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,440
Oh my god, I'm trying to!

1721
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:54,340
No!

1722
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,580
Okay, don't worry.

1723
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,800
There we go.

1724
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:04,820
Don't worry.

1725
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:05,680
Don't worry.

1726
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,980
He can't get to me now.

1727
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,720
Oh shit, he got to me now!

1728
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,380
He got to me now!

1729
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,640
Jesus Christ!

1730
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,820
Did I do it?

1731
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,880
I did it!

1732
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,400
Wait, did I do it?

1733
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,020
Am I dead?

1734
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:25,160
Oh, I'm dead.

1735
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:25,560
Never mind.

1736
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,240
I didn't do it.

1737
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,180
I didn't do it!

1738
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,760
Why did I make a good sound?

1739
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,040
Like why?

1740
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,340
He like made a good sound.

1741
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:38,520
Yeah, so I thought I did it.

1742
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:42,400
Guys, I didn't do it.

1743
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,980
Oh my god, please, please, you're so...

1744
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,620
Please, I'm, I'm, please!

1745
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,040
Holy shit, please!

1746
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,720
I need to beat this guy.

1747
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,400
No matter what.

1748
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,800
Oh my god, please!

1749
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,120
Every ounce of my energy.

1750
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,140
Oh my god, please!

1751
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:00,960
For the tiny chance of a victory.

1752
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:02,220
Me first.

1753
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,040
If I die, I'll see you in the next one.

1754
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,980
Me first.

1755
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,600
No, no!

1756
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,020
Okay, nice.

1757
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:10,940
That's fucking right.

1758
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,480
That's fucking right.

1759
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,940
And then, charge!

1760
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,140
Kamehameha!

1761
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,540
That's fucking right!

1762
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,340
What are you gonna do, huh?

1763
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:22,980
No, stop!

1764
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:23,520
Shit!

1765
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,080
Oh!

1766
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:27,480
Oh, I missed!

1767
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:27,940
No!

1768
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:28,700
I'm dead.

1769
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,180
Wait, I can get it first.

1770
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:30,780
I can get it first.

1771
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,000
Oh, he fucking blocked it!

1772
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,180
You're such a little bitch!

1773
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,140
No.

1774
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:38,920
Oh, no.

1775
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,360
No, please!

1776
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,400
I swear I dodged!

1777
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:44,220
No!

1778
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,520
I'm gonna head to the tail.

1779
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,280
I'm gonna head to the tail.

1780
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,040
Where's the tail?

1781
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:51,600
Give me the tail!

1782
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:51,800
No!

1783
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,120
Jesus Christ!

1784
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,000
What?

1785
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:57,620
Oh, god!

1786
01:14:58,580 --> 01:14:59,760
Bro, we're gonna be here forever!

1787
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:00,640
What?

1788
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:00,740
Oh!

1789
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:04,820
This giant fucking ape!

1790
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,700
We're gonna be here fucking forever!

1791
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:13,900
Jesus!

1792
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,580
Okay.

1793
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:18,800
Okay.

1794
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:19,600
What?

1795
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,720
I totally blocked!

1796
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,160
This is bullshit!

1797
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,220
This is Vegeta propaganda!

1798
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,080
No matter what!

1799
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,220
Oh my god, please!

1800
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,740
I'll have to use every ounce of my energy!

1801
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,060
Please!

1802
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:36,720
Oh my god!

1803
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,480
For the tiniest chance of victory!

1804
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:38,980
Oh, nice!

1805
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:40,580
If I die...

1806
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,240
I'm too fucking low!

1807
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:43,260
I'll see you in the next one!

1808
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,500
At least I'll get to apologize to you!

1809
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:46,920
Fuck you!

1810
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,060
I'll shoot you in the fucking crotch if I have to!

1811
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:51,780
That's fucking right!

1812
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,220
You think I won't?

1813
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:54,600
Yeah!

1814
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,920
Oh, come on!

1815
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:56,680
No!

1816
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:57,700
No!

1817
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,860
I'll burn you!

1818
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,600
Please stop breaking...

1819
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:01,780
No!

1820
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,340
What is this?

1821
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,180
Guys...

1822
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:07,300
Oh my god!

1823
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:07,840
Nice!

1824
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:09,820
Oh my god!

1825
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,020
No!

1826
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,060
This is bullshit!

1827
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:14,760
Please stop breaking me!

1828
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,920
Oh my god!

1829
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,900
Why would they put this in the beginning?

1830
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,140
I...

1831
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,860
Why would they...

1832
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:31,920
Why would they put this in the fucking beginning?

1833
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,700
Guys, give me a sec.

1834
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:35,540

01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,060
You can't get to me.

Please stop breaking!

1931
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,160
That was the closest.

1932
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,080
That was the closest I have.

1933
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,820

01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,720
That's holding back!

1953
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:52,900
Okay.

OH MY GOD!

2030
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,120
You don't!

2031
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,420
Okay... that's...

2032
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:54,780
Leave me ALONE!

2033
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:02,740
I need to beat this guy.

2034
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:06,260
Oh please...

2035
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:08,560
I'm going to use every ounce of my energy...

2036
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,460
...for the tiniest chance...

2037
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:11,140
...at victory!

2038
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:12,640
The tiniest chance.

2039
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,600
Is this?

2040
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,280
Here we go.

2041
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,300
Alright, this is so sad.

2042
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,520
That is the saddest thing I saw today.

2043
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:33,060
Oh my god, I fucking hate this guy so much!

2044
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:37,580
Please!

2045
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,660
Oh my god, you suck!

2046
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,140
You suck!

2047
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,980
You suck!

2048
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:51,860
Why are you like this?

2049
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:58,540
Oh my god, please.

2050
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,520
Oh my god.

2051
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,460
Please don't get close to me.

2052
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,480
Please don't get close to me.

2053
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,560
Don't worry, he doesn't care.

2054
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:07,920
No.

2055
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,380
Oh, don't worry, the rock did not block me.

2056
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,380
Wait, what?!

2057
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,040
I didn't see you, you fucker!

2058
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:22,740
Please.

2059
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,620
What is he doing?

2060
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:26,380
What is he doing?!

2061
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,620
What the fuck is that?!

2062
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,240
Yalikun!

2063
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:34,980
Yalikun!

2064
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:38,190
Bro!

2065
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:41,790
We do not need a Yalikun!

2066
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,070
He literally...

2067
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,450
Oh my god.

2068
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:49,050
Bro!

2069
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,970
He...

2070
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:53,710
Oh hey, my proficiency went up!

2071
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,690
That...

2072
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:56,130
That was...

2073
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:58,650
That was so disrespectful.

2074
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:00,470
That...

2075
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,110
That was so disrespectful.

2076
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:06,470
Oh my god, please, no!

2077
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:08,410
Stop.

2078
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,250
Stop!

2079
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:11,690
Stop!

2080
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:14,010
Oh my god.

2081
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:15,830
Oh my god.

2082
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,690
Oh, please.

2083
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:20,630
Yes, it was.

2084
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,310
It was you!

2085
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,590
Oh my god.

2086
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:26,910
In 20 years, one day.

2087
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:28,950
Guys, in 20 years.

2088
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:29,490
Cheers!

2089
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:32,130
We'll know what it's like.

2090
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:34,050
Well, no.

2091
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:42,130
It's fine, me too.

2092
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,050
Oh god, no.

2093
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:46,730
Oh, that's fine.

2094
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:47,530
No!

2095
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:49,150
Whoa!

2096
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,090
Kamehameha!

2097
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:54,830
Oh god, no!

2098
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:55,370
Nope.

2099
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:56,610
Oh god.

2100
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:57,550
I'm trying to block!

2101
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:58,430
Stop!

2102
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:02,370
Guys, it's very rude for you to...

2103
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:03,090
It's very rude!

2104
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:07,270
He can aim up!

2105
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:12,270
Okay, I didn't realize he can aim up.

2106
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:12,890
Guys.

2107
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:15,810
Okay.

2108
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:18,710
Alright, there we go.

2109
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:24,090
Goodbye.

2110
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:26,610
Get over there.

2111
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:27,290
Get over here.

2112
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:28,270
Get over...

2113
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:28,450
No!

2114
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:29,110
Fuck!

2115
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:30,090
I don't know why I did that!

2116
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,590
I felt so cocky!

2117
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:34,710
I felt so cocky!

2118
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:35,770
Whoa!

2119
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:38,270
Here we go.

2120
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:47,870
I'll get it first!

2121
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,610
I'll get it first!

2122
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:50,430
That's fucking...

2123
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:52,590
Oh, it doesn't matter if I get it first, though.

2124
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:53,970
It doesn't matter.

2125
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:55,690
Okay.

2126
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:56,210
Nice.

2127
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:57,190
No!

2128
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:58,490
He can do that?!

2129
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:02,470
He can do that too?!

2130
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,110
Guys, I...

2131
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:04,790
There's no way.

2132
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,450
There's no way!

2133
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:11,470
Oh my god!

2134
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:13,310
Okay.

2135
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:15,770
After all this time, I get it!

2136
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:18,150
Don't worry, he can shoot through that!

2137
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:19,510
Guys, he shot through that!

2138
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:23,090
Guys, I can't believe Rock doesn't block me from that!

2139
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:23,910
Guys, I can't believe Rock doesn't block me from that!

2140
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:25,290
I can't believe!

2141
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:27,330
I owe this to you, Graves!

2142
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:28,610
Okay.

2143
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:31,290
No matter what!

2144
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:32,390
Okay, there we go.

2145
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:33,250
Don't worry, I got you.

2146
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:34,970
Every ounce of my energy!

2147
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:35,790
Here I go!

2148
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:36,930
For the tiniest chance!

2149
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,130
There we go!

2150
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:39,470
It didn't do anything!

2151
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:40,070
That's fine!

2152
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:41,750
I'll see you in the next one!

2153
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,650
At least I'll get to apologize to you!

2154
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:45,170
That's fine!

2155
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:48,850
My...

2156
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:51,130
I... Oh, that's fine!

2157
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:53,050
He walked into it like a little bitch!

2158
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:55,210
Scotty!

2159
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,570
Don't fail me now!

2160
01:27:57,850 --> 01:27:58,750
Where am I?

2161
01:27:58,750 --> 01:27:59,610
Oh, fuck!

2162
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:02,830
What?!

2163
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:03,250
Okay!

2164
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:04,370
That's fine!

2165
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:06,350
Okay.

2166
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,150
That's okay.

2167
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:11,550
Here we go.

2168
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:13,530
That's fine!

2169
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:14,250
I can do this!

2170
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:15,850
I cannot!

2171
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:16,250
Okay!

2172
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:19,830
There's the other one?

2173
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,090
What's the other one?

2174
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:22,710
Oh, that!

2175
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,640
Okay.

2176
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,440
Here we go.

2177
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:31,020
Wait, what's...

2178
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:32,480
This way!

2179
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:34,440
Oh, god!

2180
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:35,840
It's fine!

2181
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:38,300
It's not fine!

2182
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,120
I'm so weak!

2183
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,280
I'm so weak!

2184
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,200
I'm so weak!

2185
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,700
I can't hear you!

2186
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,860
Guys, this is my first...

2187
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:59,360
My first Dragon Ball Z fighting game!

2188
01:28:59,440 --> 01:28:59,680
Please!

2189
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:04,920
Please!

2190
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:05,240
Please!

2191
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:05,880
Kamehameha!

2192
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,020
No, it's okay.

2193
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:08,660
Not nice.

2194
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,560
Let me fly!

2195
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,300
Let me fly!

2196
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:15,380
Okay.

2197
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:19,540
Whoa!

2198
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,220
Okay.

2199
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,980
I can keep charging!

2200
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:26,860
I can keep charging!

2201
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,200
That should be...

2202
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:30,400
Oh!

2203
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,500
You're such a fucker!

2204
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,610
I am trying!

2205
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:46,030
He's always a fucking fly!

2206
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:47,190
He likes to fly!

2207
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:49,470
I'm trying to see!

2208
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:50,390
Look at him!

2209
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,630
He comes back up like a little bitch!

2210
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:57,370
He just...

2211
01:29:57,370 --> 01:29:58,890
He just likes to fly!

2212
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:01,670
I can't stop him from that!

2213
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:03,390
I can't stop this!

2214
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:03,630
Look!

2215
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:04,930
He's flying!

2216
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:07,850
Like... I'm...

2217
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:09,330
This is as high as I could go!

2218
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,750
This is as high as I can literally go!

2219
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:13,130
This is...

2220
01:30:16,690 --> 01:30:17,410
Literally!

2221
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:18,770
This is...

2222
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:20,870
He just keeps getting higher!

2223
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:21,870
He...

2224
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:27,030
All he wants to do is just kill me!

2225
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:28,710
Okay.

2226
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:29,670
That's fine.

2227
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:30,690
No!

2228
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:35,350
Okay.

2229
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:37,090
Get out of here!

2230
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:39,470
I'm trying my best to be above him!

2231
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:42,350
But all he wants to do is just fly up!

2232
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:43,310
He's...

2233
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:45,390
He just wants to keep flying!

2234
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:48,150
Please!

2235
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,310
Don't get close to me!

2236
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:50,530
Please get away!

2237
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:51,250
No!

2238
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:52,430
Ah!

2239
01:30:55,750 --> 01:31:00,330
And with that, I lost the majority of my HP!

2240
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:02,670
What was that?

2241
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:05,890
And this is how I lost it all!

2242
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:10,330
It was just that easy!

2243
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:12,670
It was that easy!

2244
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:17,810
All it took was one hit!

2245
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:21,950
All it took was one fucking...

2246
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:24,230
One fucking hit!

2247
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:26,370
Oh my god!

2248
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:27,390
This is it!

2249
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:29,070
Oh my god!

2250
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:29,330
Please!

2251
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,250
Don't get near me!

2252
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:32,310
Don't get near me!

2253
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:32,650
Don't get near me!

2254
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:38,190
Oh my god!

2255
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:39,670
We did it!

2256
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:46,210
We fucking did it!

2257
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:52,230
Oh my god!

2258
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:54,790
One HP in a dream!

2259
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:57,750
Let's go!

2260
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:59,110
We did it!

2261
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:00,850
Oh my god!

2262
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:03,010
We fucking did it!

2263
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:06,110
It's Spirit Bomb time!

2264
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:08,670
It's Spirit Bomb time!

2265
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:09,150
Solar Flare!

2266
01:32:10,910 --> 01:32:12,730
By the time he needs!

2267
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:14,110
Goku uses...

2268
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:16,030
I wish this was more cinematic for this.

2269
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:16,890
It's not a screenshot.

2270
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:19,130
Goku uses his Solar Flare.

2271
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:21,630
Or have narration.

2272
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:23,230
Then makes a run for it.

2273
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:24,510
Getting as far as he can.

2274
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:27,550
Okay, I think I put enough distance between us.

2275
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:30,750
I wish they used like the classic like the Dragon Ball Z narrator.

2276
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:37,810
To gather the little key from all the living creatures on Earth to fire one shot in the hopes of turning things around.

2277
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:38,990
Mack!

2278
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:40,690
Thank you for the five gifted ships!

2279
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:41,110
Thank you!

2280
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:41,670
Thank you!

2281
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:43,970
Coward!

2282
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:45,090
Where are you?

2283
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:46,450
I am the cinematic!

2284
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:48,590
Time's up!

2285
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,390
He found me!

2286
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:53,890
There!

2287
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:54,310
It's done!

2288
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:57,330
I've gathered energy from every corner of the world!

2289
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:58,750
Now!

2290
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:00,570
Take this!

2291
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:10,950
Oh wait, no!

2292
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:11,850
He passed away?

2293
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:14,410
That's sad.

2294
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,710
I didn't know the narrator passed away.

2295
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:20,890
Mori, thank you for the super chat!

2296
01:33:20,990 --> 01:33:21,310
Thank you!

2297
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:21,910
Thank you!

2298
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:24,150
Dragons of the chat, lend Doki your bow!

2299
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:26,170
Raise your arms up, chat!

2300
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:28,250
Give me your powers!

2301
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:32,090
Consider that a little farewell present.

2302
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:36,430
I don't have the strength to lift a finger.

2303
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:39,190
So just do what you're gonna do to me, alright?

2304
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:42,270
Take your best shot!

2305
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:43,410
Yeah, pussy.

2306
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,470
Do it.

2307
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:50,010
Damn you, Kakarot!

2308
01:33:50,690 --> 01:33:54,490
How dare you leave a scar on my beautiful face!

2309
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:59,930
I was gonna...

2310
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:04,310
Oh Vegeta, you're not... It's just on your fucking ape face.

2311
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:06,430
It's on your human face.

2312
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:07,810
Or sorry, Saiyan face.

2313
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:09,590
Oh shit!

2314
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:10,670
Oh!

2315
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:15,110
Hey look!

2316
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:21,090
If two Saiyans turn into a giant ape, you can technically say he's the hottest ape around.

2317
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:25,510
Bro, it's taking forever to crush him.

2318
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:29,570
Every bone in your body breaking must hurt!

2319
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:33,410
I think your friends are here.

2320
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:34,770
How quaint!

2321
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:38,380
Gohan!

2322
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:42,220
You put my dad down right now!

2323
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,920
I can't believe he became an office worker.

2324
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,020
He became...

2325
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:50,560
He became a salaryman after all that.

2326
01:34:54,950 --> 01:35:02,410
Yajirobe, who has been waiting for the right moment to attack, leaps out and slices off the great ape's Vegeta tail.

2327
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:04,210
Go Yajirobe!

2328
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:07,550
Vegeta returns to his regular form.

2329
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:14,350
However, Goku remains incapacitated and not a Krillin nor Gohan stand a chance against even a weakened Vegeta.

2330
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:19,850
Calling Krillin to his side, Goku entrusts him with the spirit bomb.

2331
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:23,810
All that's left is to wait for it on the opening... Guys!

2332
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:25,090
Raise your hands!

2333
01:35:26,410 --> 01:35:27,590
This is it!

2334
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:28,790
Raise your hands!

2335
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:31,790
I know it's for Krillin but like, he's the best we can do!

2336
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:39,390
I know you wanted to give your spirit bomb to Goku and we're now giving it to his like, to a bootleg version of him, but raise your hands!

2337
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:47,610
I fucking was so mad!

2338
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:50,950
No choice now!

2339
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:54,830
I can't!

2340
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:54,870
I can't!

2341
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:55,590
The muscle man!

2342
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:00,810
Krillin's win count!

2343
01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:03,710
Whoa!

2344
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:04,590
He missed?

2345
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:11,490
With the power of hope and determination!

2346
01:36:12,210 --> 01:36:13,050
My son!

2347
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,240
Oh my god!

2348
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:35,900
Gohan!

2349
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,160
Vegeta survives the spirit bomb!

2350
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:40,740
And he's naked!

2351
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,780
He's a naked...

2352
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:45,200
I'm trying not to say the M word.

2353
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:47,520
But he's a naked giant ape.

2354
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:54,280
My sensitivity training in HR has taught me that only Saiyans can say that.

2355
01:36:54,860 --> 01:37:02,020
Krillin's just about to finish Vegeta off once and for all when Goku stops him.

2356
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:10,440
Now where the existence of Planet Namek, Krillin, Gohan, and Bulma believe it may hold a new set of Dragon Balls.

2357
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,680
The ape!

2358
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,300
As Goku needs more time to recuperate the three set off.

2359
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:30,120
I'm trying not to say, you know, the chimpanzee word.

2360
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,000
Chimpanzees with tails!

2361
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,460
I can't say that!

2362
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:38,040
It's not good!

2363
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:39,780
That's a freeze!

2364
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:45,580
If you say chimpanzee with tail word, that makes you like Frieza.

2365
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,160
And that's not good.

2366
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:51,720
Chimpanzee is worse?

2367
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,560
How are they worse?

2368
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,240
They're literally smarter than monkeys!

2369
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:56,540
I'm so sorry if I offend anyone.

2370
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,280
I'm so sorry.

2371
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,460
It's true!

2372
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:05,660
Chimpanzees are smarter than monkeys!

2373
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:17,990
After about one month after the group set off on their journey, Goku receives an SOS from planet Namek.

2374
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:20,350
We're not monkeys!

2375
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:22,290
Monkeys are different!

2376
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:25,050
They have tails!

2377
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:34,250
Okay, apes and monkeys, the difference between gorillas, chimpanzees, and monkeys is that gorillas and chimpanzees don't have tails.

2378
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:38,330
And like, monkeys have tails!

2379
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:46,770
On the spaceship, Goku continues because Frieza uses it derogatory against Saiyans.

2380
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:51,090
You need to chill out!

2381
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:57,670
A newly recovered Vegeta also arrives, hoping to lay his hands on the very same Dragon Balls.

2382
01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:00,450
To get their strong!

2383
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,790
Gamer, thank you for the super chat!

2384
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:03,190
Thank you!

2385
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:03,850
Thank you!

2386
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:09,090
Toki, I worshipped you!

2387
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:13,330
I'll pay you ten dollars to stop digging the hole!

2388
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:16,130
And Tom, thank you for the super chat!

2389
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:16,730
Thank you!

2390
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:17,430
Thank you!

2391
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:21,550
Vegeta may have in response, but she just seemed to team up with Krillin.

2392
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:24,130
Oh my god, these cut- they're so fa- The Ginyu Forces!

2393
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:25,670
I love the Ginyu Forces!

2394
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:40,010
They skipped so much!

2395
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:40,670
Yeah, they did!

2396
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:42,390
How did we get here?

2397
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:44,770
How the fuck did we get here?

2398
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:07,770
Look, you guys have got a choice to make here!

2399
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:09,570
Hey, Toki, I just bought you a shovel!

2400
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:11,090
Please keep going!

2401
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:13,350
Toki, thank you for the super chat!

2402
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:13,850
Thank you!

2403
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:17,950
Either get off this planet and go home, or you're gonna wind up like your friend here!

2404
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:20,930
Did you hear that, Bertha?

2405
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:23,390
I forgot that's his voice!

2406
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:26,810
This goat knocks a raccoon with a lucky shot!

2407
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:28,310
And suddenly, he's dishing out threats to the likes of us!

2408
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:29,530
Gorilla, gorilla, gorilla!

2409
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:33,350
Tom, thank you for the super chat!

2410
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:33,710
Thank you!

2411
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:34,310
Thank you!

2412
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:36,010
I forgot he's Australian!

2413
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:42,490
I forgot most of the Ginyu Forces are Australian.

2414
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:49,770
The Space Australians.

2415
01:40:50,090 --> 01:40:51,550
That's why they're in Frieza's army!

2416
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:52,450
They're criminals!

2417
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:54,570
Don't worry, I learned...

2418
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:59,210
Even though I learned how to actually play the game, I'm gonna do my favorite move.

2419
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:00,850
Triangle, triangle, triangle!

2420
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:04,070
It has always worked!

2421
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:07,390
That's right!

2422
01:41:08,110 --> 01:41:08,950
That's right!

2423
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:12,030
Now that you're tiny, I can do my favorite move!

2424
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:13,670
That's right!

2425
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:18,250
I didn't learn!

2426
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:21,290
Wait, can I...

2427
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:24,470
That's fucking right!

2428
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:27,630
I don't need to learn!

2429
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:28,390
Oh shit!

2430
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:29,390
Oh shit!

2431
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:30,370
Maybe I do!

2432
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:31,650
Maybe...

2433
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:32,930
Maybe...

2434
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:35,430
Maybe I actually do need to learn.

2435
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:36,150
No!

2436
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:39,510
At best I'll use the Kamehameha!

2437
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:42,250
Oh shit!

2438
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:43,690
What?

2439
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:45,650
That fucking tracks me?

2440
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:47,110
Oh!

2441
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:47,910
Where am I?

2442
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:50,090
Where the fuck am I?

2443
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:52,750
That's fine.

2444
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:53,750
I have so much HP.

2445
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:54,870
Like...

2446
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:56,590
That's so fine.

2447
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:57,190
Like...

2448
01:41:57,190 --> 01:41:59,250
We don't need to breathe water.

2449
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:01,310
Oh shit.

2450
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:05,030
Don't make me use the circle on you just like how I used it on Vegeta.

2451
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:06,830
Don't fucking make me use it.

2452
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:08,250
That's fucking right.

2453
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:09,510
We don't need to breathe water.

2454
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:10,290
We're Saiyans.

2455
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:13,370
Why is Goku green?

2456
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:14,510
Is he stupid?

2457
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:15,910
Yay!

2458
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:19,570
So easy.

2459
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:27,960
And we did it!

2460
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:31,910
All me!

2461
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:35,010
Goku swiftly overpowers two members of the Ginyu forces.

2462
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:43,150
After he manages to escape, but Goku has more than demonstrated the fruits of his training.

2463
01:42:44,210 --> 01:42:47,470
He hears about the Dragon Ball from Gohan and the others.

2464
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:55,230
But before they can take action, Goku senses a strong ki headed to the direction of Guru.

2465
01:42:56,430 --> 01:43:01,210
Goku tells the others to head straight for the Dragon Balls where he readies himself once more.

2466
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:04,470
It's time for him to put an end to Ginyu.

2467
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:05,110
No!

2468
01:43:05,290 --> 01:43:06,530
Not Captain Ginyu!

2469
01:43:06,630 --> 01:43:07,250
He's so cool!

2470
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:09,270
So this is the guy, huh?

2471
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:12,310
His power level is only around 5,000.

2472
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:16,730
That's him, Captain.

2473
01:43:17,070 --> 01:43:18,070
Don't be fooled.

2474
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:20,390
This freak's way stronger than that.

2475
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:21,250
Am I in a new timeline?

2476
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:24,770
How did I get in?

2477
01:43:25,230 --> 01:43:27,590
He must be capable of boosting his strength in the midst of combat.

2478
01:43:27,890 --> 01:43:32,670
From what I can tell, I'd say his true power level is somewhere around 60,000.

2479
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:36,230
60,000?

2480
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:37,750
But that can't be!

2481
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:40,450
Oh, is he gonna go, I wanna be a fry!

2482
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:43,990
It's not unheard of.

2483
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:50,450
He could have a natural talent, or perhaps his abilities have been amplified by a mutation like us.

2484
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:55,250
Either way, this battle's sure to be interesting.

2485
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:57,350
I already fixed him?

2486
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:58,750
I fucking knew it, guys.

2487
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:00,470
Bulma was right.

2488
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:02,750
You can fix masked criminals.

2489
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:05,090
You can't fix masked murderers, guys.

2490
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:08,170
As long as you're hot enough.

2491
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:16,290
Oh, shit.

2492
01:44:16,830 --> 01:44:18,270
Okay, um, oh, oh.

2493
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:19,290
Guys, guys, please.

2494
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:20,330
Guys, guys.

2495
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:21,790
Guys, oh, shit!

2496
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:23,050
I don't want the- guys!

2497
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:24,210
Guys!

2498
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:25,230
Guys!

2499
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:32,430
Guys, I don't- I don't wanna- I don't wanna be in this timeline anymore, guys!

2500
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:38,290
I don't- Guys, I don't wanna be in this timeline anymore, guys!

2501
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:41,510
Guys, this timeline fucking sucks, guys!

2502
01:44:44,430 --> 01:44:47,130
This timeline fucking sucks!

2503
01:44:50,730 --> 01:44:51,570
Bulma.

2504
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:53,110
Oh my god.

2505
01:44:54,890 --> 01:44:55,730
What?

2506
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:05,070
Yeah, he doesn't need help!

2507
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:05,910
Look at him!

2508
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:07,030
He's so okay!

2509
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:11,170
He's- he's so okay, guys!

2510
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:13,990
Oh.

2511
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:15,470
Don't worry!

2512
01:45:15,630 --> 01:45:16,310
Look at that!

2513
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:18,430
He's so healthy!

2514
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:20,990
Oh, shit.

2515
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:23,090
Oh, fuck.

2516
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:23,730
Okay, don't worry.

2517
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:25,950
There we go.

2518
01:45:27,370 --> 01:45:28,210
What's going on?

2519
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:29,910
Did I do it?

2520
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:32,510
Oh, shit!

2521
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:33,550
No, I'm gonna be a frog!

2522
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:37,250
No, I'm gonna be a frog!

2523
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:38,550
No, don't turn me into a frog!

2524
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:43,270
Don't turn me into you, and then turn me into a frog!

2525
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:44,190
Don't turn me into you, and then turn me into a frog!

2526
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:45,290
No, I don't wanna change!

2527
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:52,050
Nooo!

2528
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:54,790
I don't wanna change!

2529
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:02,210
Then he lets out a definite scream.

2530
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:02,770
Then he lets out a definite scream.

2531
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:07,330
And then he changes a technique that enables him to switch bodies with Goku.

2532
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:12,970
Now in control of Goku's body, Captain Ginyu heads back to his spaceship with his subordinate.

2533
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:19,630
Goku makes a desperate chase after them, but is hindered, trapped in Captain Ginyu's injured body.

2534
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:21,170
Guys, listen!

2535
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:22,730
That's not me!

2536
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:25,150
Using my body!

2537
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:29,990
The others arrive to find Goku battling his own body.

2538
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:34,130
Unknown to everyone, Vegeta has his own plans for Ginyu, but first...

2539
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:35,790
...

2540
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:36,010
...

2541
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:42,650
Seeing that Birda has lost his will to fight, Vegeta ruthlessly puts an end to his life.

2542
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:48,670
Okay, why are you questioning?

2543
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:53,970
Yeah, I was gonna be like, bro, this is another Saturday for Vegeta!

2544
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:56,010
He literally blew up planets!

2545
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:57,370
He killed children!

2546
01:46:57,670 --> 01:47:00,250
You think he cares at this point?!

2547
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:06,290
After finishing off Birda, Vegeta shifts his attention to Ginyu, who has taken over Goku's body.

2548
01:47:07,610 --> 01:47:09,870
He literally killed children!

2549
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:11,090
He doesn't care!

2550
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:16,910
He doesn't even care!

2551
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:20,090
He doesn't feel anything, guys.

2552
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:22,810
Like, it's not that he likes it.

2553
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:24,750
He doesn't even feel anything.

2554
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,170
He's just like, okay.

2555
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:28,490
No!

2556
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:37,160
Goku rushes to intercept Ginyu's body change.

2557
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,400
And is able to reclaim his own body just in the nick of time.

2558
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:46,420
Yeah!

2559
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:01,020
Oh no, it's frog time.

2560
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:06,520
Frog time!

2561
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,260
Vegeta, dodge!

2562
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:14,620
Goku throws the frog between the Captain and Vegeta.

2563
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,060
Oh my god, this is like...

2564
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:24,380
I feel like I'm getting spark notes to game right now.

2565
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:28,540
Like, everything is so fast!

2566
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,840
I feel like it's literally like spark notes.

2567
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:39,500
Captain Ginyu is now trapped inside a frog, and Goku is saved.

2568
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:47,180
Goku is then put inside a medical machine to recover.

2569
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:50,580
However, he can sense... Oh my god.

2570
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:52,600
Oh my god, it's Frieza!

2571
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:53,840
My hero!

2572
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,280
Meanwhile, Vegeta and the others sense an immense power coming from their opponent.

2573
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:05,300
One that far exceeds their own.

2574
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:13,200
Just as he is marveling at Frieza's strength, Goku treatments finishes, and he is fully healed.

2575
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:24,840
When Goku arrives at the raging battle, Vegeta is moments away from death at Frieza's hands.

2576
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:30,280
I'm begging you, please, beat him for me!

2577
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,580
For the pride of our race!

2578
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,400
You must defeat him!

2579
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,640
Please, he must die by a Saiyan's hand!

2580
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:42,400
And so the battle between Goku and Frieza begins.

2581
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:43,400
Oh, I'm talking about Vegeta!

2582
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:44,960
He's my...

2583
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,340
Okay, maybe not.

2584
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:50,360
I forgot he's also a murderer.

2585
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:54,400
I forgot my whole spiel about him murdering children.

2586
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,660
Alright, in the end...

2587
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:01,560
In the end, Mr. Satan is my hero.

2588
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:02,020
It's time for me to share my pride.

2589
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:03,980
Pride in myself.

2590
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:10,680
I am a Saiyan that was raised on planet Earth.

2591
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:18,920
All we know is that Mr. Satan is the...

2592
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:19,580
is the...

2593
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:22,520
is the universe's hero.

2594
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:23,460
I will defeat you!

2595
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,520
Goku is just trying to take Mr. Satan's credit.

2596
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:30,540
And I would just love to see you try.

2597
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:32,980
I love Frieza's voice actor though.

2598
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,160
It just fits so well.

2599
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,460
Where the fuck did they come from?

2600
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,220
They felt like they were never in the story.

2601
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:45,760
I know they were in the original manga.

2602
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:48,540
Don't listen to that Goku propaganda.

2603
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,800
Mr. Satan is my hero!

2604
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,700
Yeah, I'm like, where the fuck did...

2605
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:02,400
I was like, where the...

2606
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:02,840
Oh!

2607
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:07,080
I was supposed to know!

2608
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:10,440
It's never gave me shit like this before!

2609
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:12,440
Like, how?

2610
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:16,240
How was I supposed to know I had to do a fucking quick time event?

2611
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:17,080
How?

2612
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,900
I thought I just had to mash until I didn't have to mash again.

2613
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:30,600
Oh my god, is he...

2614
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,720
Is he gonna come over?

2615
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:34,760
Why aren't you a gamer?

2616
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:38,600
Sometimes I don't know!

2617
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,860
Sometimes I don't know!

2618
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:42,520
Okay.

2619
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:45,160
Don't worry, I can keep doing this forever.

2620
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,780
Now that I learned the cheese...

2621
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:50,460
Now that I learned the cheese, it's fine.

2622
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:57,960
Oh shit, he's coming closer.

2623
01:51:58,400 --> 01:51:59,860
Guys, he's coming closer.

2624
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:02,680
What did I do?

2625
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:03,600
I got excited.

2626
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,600
What did I...

2627
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:07,380
What did I fucking do?

2628
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:11,280
Guys, I got so excited.

2629
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:12,960
Oh!

2630
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,820
I have to press it again!

2631
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:17,240
Oh, I see!

2632
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,800
I thought I could hold it!

2633
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:22,820
I thought I could actually hold it.

2634
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:24,940
I didn't realize like... Okay.

2635
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:27,060
Okay, let's actually fight him.

2636
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:33,260
You have to like, separately press... What the fuck?

2637
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:41,300
Okay, that should be illegal now, dude.

2638
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:42,820
Don't worry.

2639
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,380
Yeah, you have to press that separately.

2640
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:46,300
I didn't know... What?

2641
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:47,460
Did he dodge now?

2642
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:48,720
Okay, guys.

2643
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:49,620
I did it too much.

2644
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:52,400
Oh my god.

2645
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,300
Guys, I did it too much.

2646
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:54,880
Now he...

2647
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,980
Now he knows.

2648
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:57,520
Now he knows.

2649
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:00,020
Okay.

2650
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,160
Nice.

2651
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:03,440
That's right.

2652
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,280
Now I have a new strat.

2653
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:05,460
Oh, shit.

2654
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:07,680
Oh, nice.

2655
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:09,680
Guys, I have a new strat now.

2656
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:12,160
Not that he knows my Kamehameha strat.

2657
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:14,380
That's fucking right.

2658
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:16,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2659
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:17,920
No!

2660
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:20,880
He banged me!

2661
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:22,660
Okay, we gotta retrap.

2662
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:27,020
Oh, shit.

2663
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:28,560
Oh, shit.

2664
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:29,620
What?

2665
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:30,980
I pressed R1!

2666
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:31,560
Okay.

2667
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,180
Okay.

2668
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:36,020
Okay, here we go again.

2669
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:36,840
Alright.

2670
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:38,520
Okay.

2671
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:40,780
Okay, not figuring it out.

2672
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:47,540
I don't know if I've ever felt this excited about the prospect of battle in my entire life.

2673
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:48,940
Oh my god.

2674
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,380
What's new, Frieza?

2675
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:52,000
Okay.

2676
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:53,680
That's fucking right.

2677
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:53,860
No!

2678
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:57,000
Come on.

2679
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:57,620
No!

2680
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:00,340
No, don't.

2681
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:00,680
Please.

2682
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:02,820
That's not cool.

2683
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:04,920
That's not cool.

2684
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:06,220
That's not cool.

2685
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:08,220
Okay.

2686
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:09,780
Kamehameha time.

2687
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:11,960
Where is he?

2688
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:15,160
Wait, where is he?

2689
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,360
Oh, there he is.

2690
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,160
I should hit him, right?

2691
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:22,120
What?

2692
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,840
Oh, you're so stupid!

2693
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:26,200
You're so fucking stupid!

2694
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,940
I'm coming in the water!

2695
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:29,540
You're so dumb!

2696
01:54:30,260 --> 01:54:31,380
Oh my god!

2697
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,640
You're so stupid!

2698
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:34,560
Oh, shit.

2699
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,120
I'm stupid.

2700
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:39,660
That's right.

2701
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:40,760
You don't need to breathe water.

2702
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,060
We don't need to breathe water.

2703
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:43,020
None of us needs it.

2704
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:44,740
That's fucking right.

2705
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:48,680
Get in here.

2706
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:49,580
Get over here.

2707
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:51,180
I'll defeat you in the water.

2708
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:53,780
Where is he?

2709
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:55,200
Where is he?

2710
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:57,820
Where the fuck is he?

2711
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:00,520
Oh.

2712
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,640
Is it?

2713
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:02,040
Is it?

2714
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:02,660
Yes, son!

2715
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:04,080
Wait, guys!

2716
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:05,980
No.

2717
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:09,800
Yes.

2718
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:10,540
Alright.

2719
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:12,540
Again?

2720
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:18,040
Goku, you can't fix everything with Spirit Bomb.

2721
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:19,260
You can't.

2722
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,040
You can't.

2723
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:25,220
Not everything can be fixed with Spirit Bomb, Goku.

2724
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,280
Not everything.

2725
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:28,740
Yes, you can.

2726
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,460
It's called friendship.

2727
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:32,820
You don't understand, Doki.

2728
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:36,720
I like...

2729
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:40,420
I swear, the Spirit Bomb shit is like his MacGuffin.

2730
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:44,920
If everything fails, we use the Spirit Bomb.

2731
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,340
Yes, it is.

2732
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:47,780
Yes, it is.

2733
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:50,320
Jesus Christ.

2734
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:54,720
Did I hit that?

2735
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:55,860
No way.

2736
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:57,260
No way.

2737
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:01,900
Oh, nice.

2738
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:02,140
Okay.

2739
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:04,000
That's fucking right.

2740
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:06,000
Bro, why is he so fucking...

2741
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2742
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:09,860
Nice.

2743
01:56:14,110 --> 01:56:14,470
Okay.

2744
01:56:14,950 --> 01:56:15,310
No.

2745
01:56:17,030 --> 01:56:17,710
Almost got it.

2746
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:19,790
No.

2747
01:56:20,990 --> 01:56:21,850
Do I get it?

2748
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:23,310
Yes!

2749
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:25,210
That's fucking right.

2750
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:31,200
Yeah!

2751
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:35,840
Impossible.

2752
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:39,000
This can't be happening to me.

2753
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:40,980
Yeah!

2754
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:42,020
I did it!

2755
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,100
Alright, guys.

2756
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:45,440
It's time for the Spirit Bomb.

2757
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:46,040
Again.

2758
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:51,180
It's time for Goku's get out of jail free card.

2759
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:57,600
Is it what it is?

2760
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:59,500
Goku manages to defeat Frieza.

2761
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:08,200
Though by the skin of his teeth, as soon as his feet touch the ground, Gohan and the others cheer, welcoming him back.

2762
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:10,040
Oh, I did the what if!

2763
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:11,700
Let's go home.

2764
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:15,840
Lucky us, my little spaceship should be able to get us back in just under six days.

2765
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,840
I keep forgetting to use the Spirit Bomb.

2766
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:20,160
I don't remember how to do it.

2767
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:21,760
Guys, I told you.

2768
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:22,840
I told you!

2769
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:26,480
We don't need to use the Spirit Bomb, chat.

2770
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:28,080
We don't.

2771
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:31,240
We can't just solve everything with a Spirit Bomb.

2772
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:34,580
We have to learn alternate...

2773
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:41,860
We have to learn alternate, like, answers.

2774
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:44,880
Not canon.

2775
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:48,960
Let's go home.

2776
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:52,640
Lucky us, my little spaceship should be able to get us back in under six days.

2777
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:56,640
Heyy!

2778
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:57,180
Wasn't that Kuren?

2779
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:00,040
Oh shit, you're right!

2780
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,980
I forgot Bulma's in this part of the story.

2781
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:07,180
Dude, I,

2782
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:23,160
Like, I just stopped hearing about Bulma?

2783
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,320
Goku, Bulma's been with us since Dragon Ball.

2784
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:50,600
We did it!

2785
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:55,200
We're gonna... similar with the Dragon Ball... with the... with the...

2786
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:01,340
Similar with the fucking Spirit Bomb.

2787
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:03,280
We're just gonna wish everybody back to life.

2788
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,780
Well, I did make him a promise!

2789
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:11,820
Ouch!

2790
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:16,540
Surely Frieza's gonna die-die now.

2791
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:26,180
They don't make evil characters like Frieza anymore.

2792
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:30,720
Like, just... characters that are just evil for the sake of being evil.

2793
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:35,640
That's why Frieza has always been, like, such an interesting character to me.

2794
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:36,520
Frieza and Vegeta.

2795
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:38,040
Vegeta's awesome.

2796
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:39,780
Vegeta's, like, just evil.

2797
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:46,080
I meant, like... I meant, like... I mean, like...

2798
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:50,260
I mean, like, just evil characters for the sake of being evil.

2799
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:54,040
Because a lot of characters now, a lot of villains, are just...

2800
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,260
The thing about villains now is that...

2801
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:58,980
No, I'm not... like, that style is, like, you know, like, back then.

2802
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:02,280
But I'm talking about newer villains, like, characters now.

2803
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,400
Where they're all, like, redeemable.

2804
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:07,160
Or, like, there's a motive on why they're so evil.

2805
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:10,440
You know, especially, like, Disney characters, too.

2806
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:14,840
They're always, like... they always have, like, characters that are, like...

2807
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:18,960
Oh, there's a reason why I'm evil and you're supposed to feel bad for me.

2808
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:21,600
But, like, I... I wish they were, like...

2809
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:22,800
It just gets so boring.

2810
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:24,740
Because, like, everybody is just...

2811
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:27,600
They just have... they have to be misunderstood or some shit.

2812
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:28,440
Like...

2813
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:32,540
Some people are just fucking bad.

2814
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:33,540
Like...

2815
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:34,740
Like...

2816
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:34,900
Like...

2817
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:37,220
Alright.

2818
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:38,040
Wait.

2819
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:39,240
Can I not start it?

2820
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:40,660
Why won't it let me start it?

2821
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:41,320
No, I don't...

2822
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:43,140
Oh, it's, like, laggy a little bit.

2823
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:43,680
Oh, there you go.

2824
02:00:51,950 --> 02:00:52,890
Yeah, Scar...

2825
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:55,190
I don't like how Scar has a tragic story...

2826
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:57,130
Backstory now in the live action.

2827
02:00:57,410 --> 02:00:58,290
And he's like...

2828
02:00:58,290 --> 02:00:59,190
My brother!

2829
02:00:59,690 --> 02:01:00,410
And I'm like...

2830
02:01:00,410 --> 02:01:00,790
What?

2831
02:01:01,730 --> 02:01:02,130
Like...

2832
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:02,890
Like...

2833
02:01:02,890 --> 02:01:03,270
What was it?

2834
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:05,190
Mufasa is, like, an orphan.

2835
02:01:05,330 --> 02:01:05,850
And, like...

2836
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:06,770
He takes over...

2837
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,670
Like...

2838
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:07,870
He...

2839
02:01:07,870 --> 02:01:09,310
It's just so weird.

2840
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:10,770
They're making...

2841
02:01:10,770 --> 02:01:13,230
They're making Lion King 2 live action.

2842
02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:14,030
Quote on quote.

2843
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:15,070
Even though it's all CGI.

2844
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:16,310
And then...

2845
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:18,090
Scar is apparently, like...

2846
02:01:18,090 --> 02:01:21,030
They gave Scar, like, a happy childhood or whatever.

2847
02:01:21,450 --> 02:01:23,650
And, like, how he sees Mufasa is...

2848
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:24,670
It's so weird.

2849
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:26,330
It's such a weird sequel.

2850
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:29,270
Let's get on my spaceship.

2851
02:01:32,930 --> 02:01:33,410
Wait.

2852
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:34,710
Are we watching this part again?

2853
02:01:35,890 --> 02:01:36,570
Wait, what?

2854
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:37,910
What did I...?

2855
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:38,590
Oh, I fucked up.

2856
02:01:42,810 --> 02:01:44,310
Wait, why am I...?

2857
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:44,570
What?

2858
02:01:45,730 --> 02:01:46,390
Skip.

2859
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:48,570
Did I press the wrong thing?

2860
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:52,430
Oh, what?

2861
02:01:54,090 --> 02:01:55,150
What happened?

2862
02:01:57,230 --> 02:01:57,890
Oh!

2863
02:01:59,890 --> 02:02:01,410
Guys, I beat the game!

2864
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:06,380
Guys, I did it!

2865
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:08,180
Guys, I did it!

2866
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:08,400
Oh!

2867
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:11,080
I beat the game!

2868
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,580
Oh my god!

2869
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:15,820
GG!

2870
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,420
I'm so confused!

2871
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:23,060
I have to fucking fight him again?

2872
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:25,820
I

2873
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:30,050
have to do it correctly?

2874
02:02:30,910 --> 02:02:33,290
This is correctly!

2875
02:02:37,210 --> 02:02:42,950
All I'm saying... Okay, that's bullshit.

2876
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:48,290
All I'm saying is that we can't keep using the Spirit Bomb as a fucking crutch, guys.

2877
02:02:51,150 --> 02:02:51,710
Okay.

2878
02:02:51,710 --> 02:02:53,190
There we go, I did it, guys.

2879
02:02:53,310 --> 02:02:53,970
First try.

2880
02:02:54,490 --> 02:02:55,430
First try.

2881
02:02:58,450 --> 02:03:01,590
Guys, I did it, guys.

2882
02:03:01,690 --> 02:03:02,410
First try.

2883
02:03:02,630 --> 02:03:03,270
First try.

2884
02:03:03,290 --> 02:03:04,530
First try.

2885
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:06,530
Where is he?

2886
02:03:07,570 --> 02:03:09,110
I can't even tell where he is.

2887
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:09,930
I'm just in the water.

2888
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:13,730
Where did I go?

2889
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:16,070
He doesn't know where I am.

2890
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:18,390
If I don't know where he is, he doesn't know where I am.

2891
02:03:18,730 --> 02:03:19,670
That's how it goes.

2892
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:22,710
What?!

2893
02:03:22,710 --> 02:03:23,630
That should be legal!

2894
02:03:26,230 --> 02:03:26,890
Oh god.

2895
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:28,750
Where am I?

2896
02:03:30,610 --> 02:03:30,970
No.

2897
02:03:30,970 --> 02:03:31,570
No way.

2898
02:03:31,590 --> 02:03:32,410
No way!

2899
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:37,370
Oh my god.

2900
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:37,630
Okay.

2901
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:38,570
That's fine.

2902
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:39,210
I know what to do.

2903
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:40,250
That's fucking right.

2904
02:03:40,710 --> 02:03:41,930
Oh, he counters too?

2905
02:03:42,150 --> 02:03:43,130
That should be cheating!

2906
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:46,350
Bro, he counters more than me!

2907
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:48,130
It's okay.

2908
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:49,170
I'm in the water.

2909
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:53,370
The water is literally like my... the counter-counter.

2910
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:56,770
What the fuck?!

2911
02:03:57,810 --> 02:03:58,990
Do I just keep charging?

2912
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:03,270
Oh shit!

2913
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:03,830
Oh shit!

2914
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:04,110
Oh!

2915
02:04:04,290 --> 02:04:04,590
Boom!

2916
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:07,530
Boost!

2917
02:04:07,610 --> 02:04:07,790
Boost!

2918
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:08,030
No!

2919
02:04:09,070 --> 02:04:09,590
Bang.

2920
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:11,290
Oh, nice.

2921
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:11,810
I dodged it.

2922
02:04:12,130 --> 02:04:12,810
That's right.

2923
02:04:12,850 --> 02:04:13,110
Bang.

2924
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:13,870
What, bitch?

2925
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:14,990
Bang.

2926
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:15,810
Again?!

2927
02:04:15,810 --> 02:04:18,190
Fucking... Oh my... Okay, we're...

2928
02:04:18,190 --> 02:04:24,950
I can't... I can't keep using water as a... I can!

2929
02:04:26,090 --> 02:04:26,890
I can!

2930
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:29,070
You don't know that!

2931
02:04:29,290 --> 02:04:30,090
Yes, I can!

2932
02:04:30,150 --> 02:04:33,210
I don't know if I've ever felt this excited about the prospect of...

2933
02:04:33,210 --> 02:04:33,250
I don't know if I've ever felt this excited about the prospect of...

2934
02:04:34,090 --> 02:04:34,590
Okay.

2935
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:37,830
Okay, nice.

2936
02:04:39,110 --> 02:04:39,950
I got him.

2937
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:44,290
If he can use bang, I can use water!

2938
02:04:46,850 --> 02:04:47,350
Okay.

2939
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:49,050
God damn it.

2940
02:04:52,870 --> 02:04:53,370
Ha!

2941
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:55,190
Alright, nice.

2942
02:04:56,190 --> 02:04:56,930
Where is he?

2943
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:57,630
Where did he go?

2944
02:04:58,790 --> 02:04:59,530
Oh shit!

2945
02:04:59,630 --> 02:04:59,810
Oh!

2946
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:02,670
Oh my god, he punched me through the...

2947
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:03,690
Oh no.

2948
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:05,670
No!

2949
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:06,670
Counter this!

2950
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:08,550
Counter this!

2951
02:05:10,990 --> 02:05:11,530
What?!

2952
02:05:11,530 --> 02:05:13,470
You can't counter back when I count!

2953
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:17,440
What?!

2954
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,040
It's time for sudden death!

2955
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:20,100
Oh god, no.

2956
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:20,500
Not again.

2957
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:22,060
Why don't we finish with the...

2958
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:23,080
Not again.

2959
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:25,160
Alright.

2960
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:26,460
No, not again!

2961
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:28,560
No!

2962
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,420
Get me out of the water!

2963
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:34,580
I don't need water as a crutch.

2964
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,360
Okay.

2965
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:39,180
Boost!

2966
02:05:39,620 --> 02:05:40,440
Did I hit him?

2967
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:41,140
I hit him.

2968
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:43,420
Okay.

2969
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:45,520
Where is he?

2970
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:47,760
Where is he?

2971
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,160
Oh, he's going in the water!

2972
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:50,480
I didn't want to go to the water!

2973
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:54,100
I'm trying so hard to play outside of the water.

2974
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:54,940
This is his fault.

2975
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:58,760
Oh, please.

2976
02:05:59,360 --> 02:05:59,800
No!

2977
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:03,640
How is he stronger?

2978
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:06,100
What the fuck!

2979
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:09,760
How did he get so difficult?

2980
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:12,480
Oh shit.

2981
02:06:12,700 --> 02:06:13,180
Nice.

2982
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:17,960
You should max power, then karma.

2983
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:18,420
Okay.

2984
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:19,340
Oh shit.

2985
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:20,980
I didn't even realize he was right in front of me.

2986
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:23,040
I couldn't tell.

2987
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:23,880
Okay.

2988
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:26,940
I'm going to max power too.

2989
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:27,880
Bitch.

2990
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:30,760
Oh shit.

2991
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:31,060
Okay.

2992
02:06:31,180 --> 02:06:31,600
Look.

2993
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:33,280
I didn't know he was there.

2994
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:33,620
I didn't know he was there.

2995
02:06:33,620 --> 02:06:34,180
I didn't.

2996
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:35,180
I didn't.

2997
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:36,360
Oh my god!

2998
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:37,520
I didn't know!

2999
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:41,780
Jesus Christ.

3000
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:44,460
How do you remember the last fight?

3001
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:49,100
Oh my god!

3002
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:50,280
And he fucking...

3003
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:53,780
Your energy, guys!

3004
02:06:55,460 --> 02:06:58,040
I'm trying to get excited apparently.

3005
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:00,460
Oh my god!

3006
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:03,440
He actually remembers the fight from before!

3007
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:03,600
I did it!

3008
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:15,300
Okay, I'm fucking powering up.

3009
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:20,000
I got cheesed by... it's not fair!

3010
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:22,060
I'm supposed to cheese the CPU!

3011
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:24,560
That's how it's supposed to go!

3012
02:07:25,060 --> 02:07:27,120
I'm literally the main character!

3013
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,180
I got revived 200 times!

3014
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:30,780
What is that?!

3015
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,740
Oh my god!

3016
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:43,400
What the fuck?!

3017
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:49,740
What the fuck is going on?!

3018
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:52,600
Goddamn!

3019
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:56,680
Why can't I do that?!

3020
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:02,540
All I'm saying is, why can't I do that?!

3021
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:06,420
I don't want to be able to do that!

3022
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:10,860
I'm alive in the vacuum of space!

3023
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:12,540
But can you?

3024
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:13,880
I don't know.

3025
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:16,660
Now perish along with this planet!

3026
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:20,860
Oh my g- Okay.

3027
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:25,560
Okay, okay, Frieza, I get it.

3028
02:08:25,940 --> 02:08:27,880
I get it, Frieza.

3029
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,800
I- I- I get it.

3030
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:35,240
I- I get it, Frieza.

3031
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:38,160
Oh my god, Frieza, please!

3032
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:39,340
Frieza, please!

3033
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:40,520
I'm sorry!

3034
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:43,500
I didn't realize me beating that game that one time!

3035
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:48,580
Me beating that game that one time messed everything up!

3036
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:49,520
Oh shit!

3037
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:53,560
Nice!

3038
02:08:53,780 --> 02:08:54,800
I did it!

3039
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:57,360
That's fucking right!

3040
02:08:58,540 --> 02:08:59,300
That's right!

3041
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:01,200
Now I'm gonna spam this now!

3042
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:02,020
Where am I?

3043
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:06,240
Where- Okay, I don't think that worked, guys.

3044
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:08,960
I- New combo!

3045
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:11,640
Holy shit!

3046
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:12,860
Wait, I'm gonna die!

3047
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:15,920
Here we go.

3048
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:17,900
It's fine.

3049
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:18,860
It's not fine.

3050
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:19,660
But it's fine.

3051
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:24,260
It's- It's so not fine, guys.

3052
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:26,920
It's definitely not fine!

3053
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:29,520
I don't feel good right now.

3054
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:32,340
I'm literally, like, one hit away.

3055
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:35,380
I'm one HP right now!

3056
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:37,800
We're not okay, guys!

3057
02:09:38,540 --> 02:09:39,380
Oh god.

3058
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:41,300
He doesn't know!

3059
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:42,260
The AI doesn't know!

3060
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:43,040
The AI doesn't know!

3061
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:45,220
That's right!

3062
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:47,080
The AI doesn't know!

3063
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:47,800
The AI knows!

3064
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:49,800
The AI knows!

3065
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:50,720
The AI knows, guys!

3066
02:09:51,420 --> 02:09:52,080
There we go.

3067
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,120
No!

3068
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:57,200
Wait, I've never seen what happens when I die.

3069
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:59,340
I never- What happens.

3070
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:00,400
Mission complete.

3071
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:02,940
He knows.

3072
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:05,280
I can't believe the AI learns.

3073
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:11,910
What happens?

3074
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:21,520
After Goku is defeated by a terrifyingly powerful Frieza...

3075
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:24,420
Frieza steals the Dragon Balls and makes his wish.

3076
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:25,320
What does he wish for?

3077
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:30,540
His name reverberates throughout this universe and every creature comes to him known as the Immortal Emperor.

3078
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:31,440
Oh, okay.

3079
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:34,620
That makes sense, you know?

3080
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:36,760
There we go.

3081
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:39,040
There we go.

3082
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:40,840
That's fine.

3083
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:43,840
I am- I- Please!

3084
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,220
I'm using a different move now.

3085
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:48,960
That's right!

3086
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:51,220
I'm boosted!

3087
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:52,440
That's right!

3088
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,320
New combo!

3089
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:56,340
New attack!

3090
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:58,720
I bet you never expected that, Frieza!

3091
02:10:59,180 --> 02:11:00,780
I bet you never expected that!

3092
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:02,760
Oh, shit.

3093
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:04,100
Oh, shit.

3094
02:11:04,420 --> 02:11:05,040
No!

3095
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:05,600
No!

3096
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:06,840
The Reverse Spirit Bomb!

3097
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:07,980
The Evil Bomb!

3098
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:10,440
The Anti-Spirit Bomb!

3099
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:10,880
No!

3100
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:12,020
No!

3101
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,420
I wanna know how to do that!

3102
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:18,380
The Reverse Spirit Bomb!

3103
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:20,940
Okay.

3104
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:23,020
That's fine.

3105
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:26,880
That's- Yeah, I fucking- Oh, no!

3106
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:27,560
The Double Counter!

3107
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:28,720
Nice.

3108
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:31,420
Oh, shit!

3109
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:31,640
No!

3110
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:33,640
I'm trying to block, but it's too late!

3111
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:36,600
He's just- Oh, I didn't- No, I didn't do it!

3112
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:37,320
No!

3113
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:39,540
Again?!

3114
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:43,140
The Death- No!

3115
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:43,800
No!

3116
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:44,020
No!

3117
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:44,140
No!

3118
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:44,200
No!

3119
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:44,380
No!

3120
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:46,740
Oh, my God!

3121
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:48,060
Oh, my God!

3122
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:49,700
He took so much HP!

3123
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:53,380
He took- Oh, my God!

3124
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:55,060
Oh, my God!

3125
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:56,920
Okay, I failed the Quick Time.

3126
02:11:57,160 --> 02:11:58,980
How is he harder?!

3127
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:02,960
How did I get that other alternate ending?!

3128
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:07,840
Like, how- How did I do it?!

3129
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,820
Oh, my God!

3130
02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:10,900
I don't even- How did I do it?!

3131
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:13,500
I don't even know how I did it last time!

3132
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:17,220
Oh, my God!

3133
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:18,980
How did I do it?!

3134
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:23,920
How- How- How did I do it?!

3135
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:28,360
How- Oh, my God!

3136
02:12:29,620 --> 02:12:31,920
Is it because of the Kamehameha?!

3137
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,220
Did I use the- The Vegeta Strat on him?!

3138
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:36,800
And then...

3139
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,920
I was able to cheese him?!

3140
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:39,440
Oh, I was!

3141
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:41,280
Oh, it was!

3142
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:44,400
That's how I did it!

3143
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:46,780
It's okay, I learned.

3144
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:48,240
I learned.

3145
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:53,180
That's right!

3146
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:58,320
That's- Oh, he fucking- WHAT?!

3147
02:12:58,320 --> 02:12:59,700
Boost, he can't do it again!

3148
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:02,140
That's fucking ra- I saw you!

3149
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:03,600
I knew you couldn't do it again!

3150
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:07,960
I knew- I knew you couldn't do it again, you bitch!

3151
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:09,740
That's fucking right!

3152
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:12,840
That's fucking right!

3153
02:13:17,550 --> 02:13:18,450
That's right!

3154
02:13:18,710 --> 02:13:20,230
What you gonna do?!

3155
02:13:20,230 --> 02:13:21,610
I'm on the skybox!

3156
02:13:22,170 --> 02:13:24,710
I'm on the skybox!

3157
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:25,910
Yeah!

3158
02:13:27,210 --> 02:13:28,210
That's right!

3159
02:13:28,510 --> 02:13:30,730
You can't even get here!

3160
02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:33,550
That's fucking right!

3161
02:13:34,410 --> 02:13:35,330
Oh, my God!

3162
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:36,030
Look at you!

3163
02:13:36,110 --> 02:13:38,310
Can't even fly up here!

3164
02:13:39,110 --> 02:13:43,570
That's fucking- Oh, he's getting higher!

3165
02:13:43,770 --> 02:13:44,650
He's getting higher!

3166
02:13:45,470 --> 02:13:46,430
That's right!

3167
02:13:47,050 --> 02:13:49,050
I was really hoping I wouldn't have to rely on this again!

3168
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:49,530
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

3169
02:13:49,910 --> 02:13:51,350
How do I- I'm gonna win this fight!

3170
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:56,030
My only choice is to gather enough energy for a spirit bomb!

3171
02:13:56,150 --> 02:13:56,530
Spirit bomb!

3172
02:13:56,610 --> 02:13:57,230
Give me your energy!

3173
02:13:57,670 --> 02:13:58,150
No!

3174
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:00,890
Oh, no!

3175
02:14:01,070 --> 02:14:01,890
Oh, my God!

3176
02:14:02,090 --> 02:14:03,450
I couldn't do it!

3177
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:06,630
Guys, I couldn't do it!

3178
02:14:06,730 --> 02:14:07,450
Oh, my God!

3179
02:14:07,450 --> 02:14:07,830
Oh, my God!

3180
02:14:07,830 --> 02:14:07,930
Oh, my God!

3181
02:14:07,930 --> 02:14:08,830
Spirit bomb!

3182
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:09,370
Spirit bomb!

3183
02:14:09,470 --> 02:14:09,490
Oh!

3184
02:14:10,070 --> 02:14:11,110
I can't move!

3185
02:14:11,330 --> 02:14:12,170
It won't let me move!

3186
02:14:13,130 --> 02:14:15,050
What the fuck?!

3187
02:14:15,370 --> 02:14:17,070
Share your energy with me!

3188
02:14:17,610 --> 02:14:19,090
It's okay, I'm in the water!

3189
02:14:19,310 --> 02:14:19,650
Spirit bomb!

3190
02:14:20,350 --> 02:14:20,910
Done!

3191
02:14:22,010 --> 02:14:22,210
Here!

3192
02:14:23,290 --> 02:14:24,470
How do I recover?

3193
02:14:25,190 --> 02:14:25,930
Did it hit?

3194
02:14:26,730 --> 02:14:27,770
I did it!

3195
02:14:27,850 --> 02:14:28,550
The water!

3196
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:34,320
The underwater spirit bomb!

3197
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:35,680
I do it!

3198
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:37,460
I do the water!

3199
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:40,820
The water straw will fucking come and collect me!

3200
02:14:40,820 --> 02:14:40,940
I'm in the water!

3201
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:42,080
I'm in the water!

3202
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:43,440
I fucking do it!

3203
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:46,680
It is 9999 damage!

3204
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:47,720
Holy shit!

3205
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,580
I knew it!

3206
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:52,460
The cannon is restored.

3207
02:14:53,540 --> 02:14:57,260
Goku's spirit bomb has finally brought an end to the long and hard-fought battle.

3208
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:01,040
At least our heroes can rest, or so they think, until...

3209
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:01,140
No.

3210
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:04,680
Please, I'm alive!

3211
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:08,720
Yo, I pressed all the buttons.

3212
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:10,260
I literally pressed all the buttons!

3213
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:10,480
Please!

3214
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:10,800
Please, I can't watch this.

3215
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:30,280
Bro,

3216
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:35,120
we can just wish him back, Goku!

3217
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:37,560
We can literally just wish him back!

3218
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:39,040
Why are you so scared?

3219
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:44,020
I mean, to be fair, watching one of your best friends die in front of you is pretty traumatizing, though.

3220
02:15:57,700 --> 02:15:59,380
Oh, he doesn't know that yet.

3221
02:16:02,180 --> 02:16:03,140
Super Saiyan!

3222
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:12,750
I forgot they don't know yet.

3223
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:23,060
But we could be like, can I have an alternate version of Krillin in my tower?

3224
02:16:23,060 --> 02:16:23,280
There's the timeline.

3225
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:24,420
There's the loophole.

3226
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:35,980
Overcome with pure rage at seeing Krillin die before his very eyes, Goku transforms into a legendary Super Saiyan!

3227
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:40,860
Once again, the trumpets of battle sound.

3228
02:16:42,560 --> 02:16:52,540
Frieza, whose whole body can survive even the vacuum of space, has decided to launch an attack powerful enough to destroy Planet Namek in its entirety.

3229
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:58,540
I like how it's like... it's like a journalist that's following them around.

3230
02:16:58,860 --> 02:17:03,020
Within five minutes left until extinction, Frieza finally reaches full power.

3231
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:07,660
Like, there's some fucking, like, war journalist that's going around taking pictures of this.

3232
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:16,700
Five minutes equals ten episodes.

3233
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:20,820
King Kai!

3234
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:27,680
This is an AP-reported live from Planet Namek.

3235
02:17:28,460 --> 02:17:30,100
Oh yeah, the five minute.

3236
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:31,960
We have five minutes left, guys!

3237
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:35,940
Guys, this is gonna be a ten-part game playthrough series.

3238
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:38,600
Of this one fight.

3239
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:46,180
Krillin can't be brought back to life with the Dragon Balls a second time!

3240
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:49,380
He fucking un-actuallyed me!

3241
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:52,800
Krillin was my best friend!

3242
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:54,620
He's like, you stupid fucking streamer!

3243
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:56,900
You fake fan!

3244
02:18:02,480 --> 02:18:05,960
Well, like, Frieza has killed a lot of people, Goku.

3245
02:18:06,260 --> 02:18:10,320
I don't know if you know this, but Frieza is an incredibly evil person.

3246
02:18:17,740 --> 02:18:22,140
Krillin be like, Pop, Dark Blade, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

3247
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:24,820
I know you want the same thing.

3248
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:28,800
You're itching to see what your 100% full power is capable of.

3249
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:32,660
Yeah, but the people he killed weren't his friends, so it was different.

3250
02:18:34,580 --> 02:18:36,080
He's part of the problem.

3251
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:47,700
Oh, he's buff-freezing now, I forgot!

3252
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:52,380
Oh my god, can I just, like, do that this entire time?

3253
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:54,160
Can I do this?

3254
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:55,360
You're just gonna keep talking!

3255
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:57,320
The Super Kamehameha!

3256
02:18:58,340 --> 02:18:58,940
Kamehameha!

3257
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:01,240
He just dodged it!

3258
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:05,880
Guys, he just... what is he doing?

3259
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:13,160
He just dodged it like it was nothing!

3260
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:19,060
Like, he just... he saw it from... like...

3261
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:21,660
Oh shit!

3262
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:24,460
Oh, I didn't realize he was, like, trying to shoot me.

3263
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:25,720
Oh, I didn't...

3264
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:29,860
Oh, his attacks are so tiny that I can't even see it!

3265
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:31,680
Oh no.

3266
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:33,540
It's my turn.

3267
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:34,400
My turn, bitch!

3268
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:36,000
Oh, okay, it's your turn.

3269
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:36,600
Now it's...

3270
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:37,700
Don't worry, when...

3271
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:39,300
Don't worry, when it's my turn...

3272
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:41,560
Don't worry, it's gonna be my turn soon, right?

3273
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:42,880
Okay.

3274
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:44,780
Oh shit, he can do that?

3275
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:47,460
Okay, don't worry, I got this, too.

3276
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:49,880
What the fuck?

3277
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:52,540
No, I'm trying to block!

3278
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:55,440
What?

3279
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:57,860
That doesn't count as...

3280
02:19:57,860 --> 02:19:58,740
Oh, now I'm angry.

3281
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:01,380
Oh my gosh, let me go!

3282
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:07,680
Fuck, he doesn't even remember people's names, that's so fucked.

3283
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:11,900
Where is he?

3284
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:18,160
Oh no, this... oh no, not the disc, not the disc, not the disc, no!

3285
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:20,460
No!

3286
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:22,240
What's going... okay.

3287
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:24,980
I can't!

3288
02:20:25,180 --> 02:20:27,620
He's so... he's so buff!

3289
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:30,940
He's so... I'm trying!

3290
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,260
I'm trying!

3291
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:34,760
He's so buff!

3292
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:40,840
He's... he's... he's...

3293
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:44,380
Oh yeah.

3294
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:50,260
Jesus Christ, how much... how much did I use there?

3295
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:52,220
Guys, this is what it was supposed to do.

3296
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:53,860
This is what it was supposed to happen if he didn't fucking dodge.

3297
02:20:54,220 --> 02:20:55,200
Like, this is...

3298
02:20:57,160 --> 02:21:02,300
This is... this is... that's what it was supposed to happen if he didn't fucking dodge there.

3299
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:03,060
Like...

3300
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:07,600
Oh God, please.

3301
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:11,000
METER SMASH!

3302
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:14,060
Oh, I kicked him!

3303
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:16,240
Oh God.

3304
02:21:17,820 --> 02:21:18,420
Please!

3305
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:19,900
Get me out of here!

3306
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:22,840
I'll never forgive you!

3307
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:25,380
That's... I know, that's what I was thinking!

3308
02:21:25,380 --> 02:21:25,980
I was like...

3309
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:27,540
Where am I?

3310
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:32,680
Did I hit him?

3311
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:35,060
How did I not hit that?

3312
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:37,180
Okay, don't worry, I'm getting angry.

3313
02:21:38,480 --> 02:21:39,020
Wait, what?

3314
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:39,980
I get my first, right?

3315
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:42,040
Yes, I get it first!

3316
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:42,780
I get it first, guys!

3317
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:44,380
I can do it again!

3318
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:45,440
Oh shit, I can't.

3319
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:48,580
Wait... he's just trying to stop it!

3320
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:50,500
He's learning!

3321
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:54,200
He's actually learning!

3322
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:56,620
How?

3323
02:21:58,500 --> 02:21:59,220
You're AI.

3324
02:21:59,560 --> 02:22:00,280
How?

3325
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:02,620
You're AI.

3326
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:05,060
No!

3327
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:08,360
No!

3328
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:13,500
Oh God.

3329
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:16,940
Oh God, it's okay.

3330
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:20,540
Oh my God, where... where... where is he?

3331
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:23,080
Don't make me... don't make me fly up!

3332
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:25,200
I swear to God!

3333
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:27,600
Okay...

3334
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:32,120
He's learning and I'm not!

3335
02:22:32,980 --> 02:22:33,560
I'm not!

3336
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:35,380
It's not fair!

3337
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:40,960
He's learning, but I don't know how to learn!

3338
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:45,190
Here we go.

3339
02:22:45,570 --> 02:22:47,890
Are you just gonna keep talking?

3340
02:22:47,890 --> 02:22:49,450
That's fine.

3341
02:22:51,810 --> 02:22:54,870
You know what... you know what time it is.

3342
02:22:55,050 --> 02:22:57,430
You know what time it is, guys.

3343
02:22:58,130 --> 02:22:58,630
You know...

3344
02:23:00,850 --> 02:23:01,530
Guys...

3345
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:03,750
You know what time it is.

3346
02:23:08,750 --> 02:23:09,430
Guys...

3347
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:10,890
Oh shit, he's learning!

3348
02:23:11,290 --> 02:23:12,770
Must save space!

3349
02:23:13,430 --> 02:23:14,450
Frieza, no!

3350
02:23:16,790 --> 02:23:19,030
That's... that's my sea spy!

3351
02:23:20,330 --> 02:23:21,610
Holy shit!

3352
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:25,690
Yeah, but like, I'm higher now.

3353
02:23:27,950 --> 02:23:28,590
What?

3354
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:30,170
How do I dodge that?

3355
02:23:30,950 --> 02:23:31,590
Okay.

3356
02:23:33,550 --> 02:23:34,190
Okay.

3357
02:23:34,510 --> 02:23:37,230
Oh my God, he actually...

3358
02:23:40,090 --> 02:23:41,450
Oh my God, what?

3359
02:23:41,450 --> 02:23:41,850
Here.

3360
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:46,710
Oh my God, please.

3361
02:23:48,030 --> 02:23:48,710
Please!

3362
02:23:48,910 --> 02:23:50,110
Please don't make that wish!

3363
02:23:55,570 --> 02:23:56,250
How?!

3364
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:57,850
Goku!

3365
02:23:58,150 --> 02:23:59,910
He wasn't even that far!

3366
02:24:00,550 --> 02:24:01,850
How do you miss?

3367
02:24:02,650 --> 02:24:04,750
How do you miss?

3368
02:24:05,950 --> 02:24:06,630
How do you miss?

3369
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:08,030
How do you miss?

3370
02:24:08,030 --> 02:24:08,950
How do you miss?

3371
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:12,310
Goku, please!

3372
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:17,070
I don't... I don't understand how you miss!

3373
02:24:18,730 --> 02:24:19,990
Goku, please!

3374
02:24:23,110 --> 02:24:24,330
Oh my...

3375
02:24:24,690 --> 02:24:26,010
That's the worst part!

3376
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:27,850
I like, literally don't understand!

3377
02:24:30,090 --> 02:24:31,670
Holy shit.

3378
02:24:33,630 --> 02:24:34,630
Oh my God.

3379
02:24:34,750 --> 02:24:35,990
Oh my...

3380
02:24:36,650 --> 02:24:37,230
There we go.

3381
02:24:37,990 --> 02:24:38,690
There we go.

3382
02:24:38,690 --> 02:24:38,710
There we go.

3383
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:41,110
Oh my God.

3384
02:24:41,150 --> 02:24:42,530
Now I'm angry!

3385
02:24:44,450 --> 02:24:45,210
That's it!

3386
02:24:45,370 --> 02:24:46,210
There's no way!

3387
02:24:50,350 --> 02:24:51,570
This has to hit!

3388
02:24:51,710 --> 02:24:53,510
There's no way he dodges this!

3389
02:24:53,990 --> 02:24:55,490
Oh, I did it!

3390
02:24:55,810 --> 02:24:57,630
I did it!

3391
02:24:57,630 --> 02:25:00,750
I fucking did it!

3392
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:02,550
Yay!

3393
02:25:05,730 --> 02:25:07,090
We did it!

3394
02:25:07,090 --> 02:25:07,370
Oh my God!

3395
02:25:07,710 --> 02:25:09,830
We fucking did it!

3396
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:16,010
Oh, the irony.

3397
02:25:16,430 --> 02:25:21,390
He who triumphs loses everything, while the vanquished escapes.

3398
02:25:22,050 --> 02:25:22,630
Talking about me?

3399
02:25:22,750 --> 02:25:26,330
I hate to gloat, but there's a lesson here on the virtue of mercy.

3400
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:29,390
Its only value is to your foe!

3401
02:25:32,410 --> 02:25:34,070
We'll see about that!

3402
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:41,870
We did it!

3403
02:25:41,970 --> 02:25:43,370
In five minutes, guys!

3404
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:46,510
I told you we can beat him in five minutes!

3405
02:25:47,490 --> 02:25:50,130
The longest five minutes of my life!

3406
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:58,160
Oh shit, he's Anki!

3407
02:26:00,600 --> 02:26:01,860
He's so Anki!

3408
02:26:07,130 --> 02:26:08,690
Oh my god, our first cinematic!

3409
02:26:09,130 --> 02:26:09,990
Oh, that's it!

3410
02:26:10,490 --> 02:26:16,430
Oh my god, did you guys see that?

3411
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:22,250
After a desperate struggle, he's set to life!

3412
02:26:22,930 --> 02:26:27,310
The spaceship he's found is too damaged to be piloted.

3413
02:26:28,330 --> 02:26:32,210
Luckily, he spies a pod piloted by a ginyu force.

3414
02:26:32,470 --> 02:26:34,350
And with that, he nearly escapes.

3415
02:26:34,670 --> 02:26:35,910
Planet Namek!

3416
02:26:36,690 --> 02:26:39,410
The pod is not headed for Earth.

3417
02:26:39,410 --> 02:26:41,430
It's destined for planet Yardrat.

3418
02:26:41,550 --> 02:26:43,590
And Goku learns a new technique.

3419
02:26:45,350 --> 02:26:46,730
Did you see that?

3420
02:26:46,890 --> 02:26:48,270
Did you see that?

3421
02:26:51,450 --> 02:26:52,910
We did it, guys!

3422
02:26:54,230 --> 02:26:56,250
Oh, is it Android Cell Arc?

3423
02:26:56,470 --> 02:26:57,770
Oh my god, my favorite arc!

3424
02:26:58,270 --> 02:27:01,210
It's not because of Android 18.

3425
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:13,900
One year has passed since the battle of Frieza on planet Namek.

3426
02:27:15,380 --> 02:27:18,140
Frieza has survived and comes to Earth seeking revenge.

3427
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:21,460
However, a mysterious young man suddenly appears for him.

3428
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:22,300
It's Trunks!

3429
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:27,320
How did blue and black hair turn into purple hair?

3430
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:37,000
A young man, Dan, transformed into a Super Saiyan just like Goku.

3431
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,680
And annihilates Frieza instantly.

3432
02:27:41,740 --> 02:27:47,560
Yet at the same time, Goku, who is on planet Yardrat, after escaping from planet Namek, returns to Earth.

3433
02:27:49,020 --> 02:27:55,780
The youth tells Goku that his name is Trunks and he has come from the future.

3434
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:56,940
The juice has arrived!

3435
02:27:57,560 --> 02:27:59,220
Little Steve, thank you for the super chat!

3436
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:00,200
Thank you, thank you!

3437
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:03,200
Apparently in the future, Trunks' friends have been murdered.

3438
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:04,360
And Goku...

3439
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:05,980
By the way, like, when...

3440
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:09,300
This is so fast, like, the little sentences sometimes.

3441
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:12,500
Because it goes on automatically if you saved it for too long.

3442
02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:13,200
Like, right now.

3443
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:16,080
Sorry, I was just trying to talk to my chat game.

3444
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:21,500
After telling Goku that he'll come to their aid when the androids arrive, Trunks returns to his own time.

3445
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:25,520
They call him the what?!

3446
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:31,260
Goku is determined to fight alongside his friends to avert the coming catastrophe in their future.

3447
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:36,760
Piccolo, what do you say?

3448
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:38,740
Want to train with me and Gohan?

3449
02:28:39,240 --> 02:28:40,960
I've been raring to fight you again.

3450
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:46,900
Okay, I'm pretty sure, like, Goku is stronger now.

3451
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:47,640
Sounds good to me.

3452
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:50,460
Krillin, what about the rest of you guys?

3453
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:55,800
Thanks, but I want to get to Master Roshi's and train with him, actually.

3454
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:56,440
Oh!

3455
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:00,000
He doesn't think you're a good teacher, Goku!

3456
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:00,840
Well, okay!

3457
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:02,900
Oh, there's Yamcha, the useless guy.

3458
02:29:05,020 --> 02:29:05,940
Why are you here?

3459
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:15,520
He's like, they're dead.

3460
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:16,480
Like, he...

3461
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:23,520
The years pass, and the fated day of May 12th has finally come.

3462
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:26,860
Goku and the others gather at a time and place that Trunks gave them.

3463
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:35,360
Guys, if all the Yamcha fans suddenly sent anti-me, I wouldn't even notice.

3464
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:37,460
Because it would be just, like, one hate mail.

3465
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:39,120
Hahaha!

3466
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:46,620
Goku and others couldn't even sense the androids before they started landing in the streets.

3467
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:53,540
Suddenly, Goku senses that Yamcha's heat is rapidly fading.

3468
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:59,340
They arrive to find him barely alive, having suffered a mortal blow!

3469
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:01,240
Oh, look at that!

3470
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:03,700
They aren't even the strong ones!

3471
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:06,980
Goku leaves Krillin with the injured Yamcha!

3472
02:30:06,980 --> 02:30:09,800
And turns to face them!

3473
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:10,460
Hahaha!

3474
02:30:12,180 --> 02:30:14,580
Why you gotta do us Yamcha...

3475
02:30:14,580 --> 02:30:15,620
Fans?!

3476
02:30:15,620 --> 02:30:18,040
Where the fuck did you get the plural from?

3477
02:30:18,420 --> 02:30:21,280
You mean, singular Yamcha fan, like...

3478
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:21,960
Hahaha!

3479
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:23,420
You agree to that, at least?

3480
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:25,360
Hahaha!

3481
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:30,000
We kicked them!

3482
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:32,220
Too many innocent people?

3483
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:34,220
Well, that is...

3484
02:30:34,220 --> 02:30:36,500
I wonder if there's, like, a kill count in Dragon Ball.

3485
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:36,960
I wonder if there's, like, a kill count in Dragon Ball.

3486
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:42,160
Of, like, how many people actually died in the fucking Dragon Ball Z universe.

3487
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:43,940
Stop it!

3488
02:30:46,360 --> 02:30:47,500
You bastards!

3489
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:53,720
It was my understanding you wanted the streets free of onlookers.

3490
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:57,000
Evidently, our solution does not please you.

3491
02:30:57,300 --> 02:30:58,340
Oh my god!

3492
02:30:59,160 --> 02:30:59,940
They did it!

3493
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:02,600
That's it!

3494
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:04,980
Follow me and we're gonna settle this!

3495
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:08,440
Settle what?

3496
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:09,360
Settle what?

3497
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:17,340
Look, Yamcha's not even here anymore.

3498
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:20,880
Goku leads the Androids to a deserted...

3499
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:22,360
I mean, technically they already...

3500
02:31:23,380 --> 02:31:26,820
Technically it's deserted already, so, like, we didn't have to leave.

3501
02:31:27,260 --> 02:31:27,660
Hahaha!

3502
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:28,680
Like...

3503
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:29,500
Like...

3504
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:30,100
I...

3505
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:31,320
I don't...

3506
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:32,460
Okay, like...

3507
02:31:32,460 --> 02:31:35,280
They already killed everybody there, so, like...

3508
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:36,060
Hahaha!

3509
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:43,260
It turns out Android 20 has been studying Goku and his friends ever since he defeated...

3510
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:47,220
He informs them that, over time, he has analyzed and come to fully grasp the power they wield.

3511
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:52,720
Android 20 is confident that victory will be his, but Goku only grins in response.

3512
02:31:53,420 --> 02:31:56,180
If all you know about me is from before I went to Namek...

3513
02:31:56,180 --> 02:31:58,000
Gotta keep the infrastructure...

3514
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:58,460
Oh, that's...

3515
02:31:58,940 --> 02:31:59,700
That's true.

3516
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:01,420
Rebuilding is hard.

3517
02:32:07,720 --> 02:32:09,680
Oh my god, he's going Super Saiyan!

3518
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:13,860
I heard you can be a Super Saiyan god now.

3519
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:15,920
If I'm the one these guys want...

3520
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:17,680
Then that's what they're gonna get!

3521
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:22,180
A most intriguing discrepancy, this dormant power.

3522
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:26,800
It departs rather considerably from the data previously compiled.

3523
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:30,960
But it is not remotely discouraging.

3524
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,760
To be fair, like, he started gathering data when he was a fucking child.

3525
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:35,280
He could still grow.

3526
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:38,980
Android number 19 shall now operate as your executioner.

3527
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:40,780
Is that right?

3528
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:41,580
Fine.

3529
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:43,780
Then get over here and fight me!

3530
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:48,140
You're Super Saiyan god Super Saiyan?

3531
02:32:48,380 --> 02:32:49,660
The fuck does that mean?

3532
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:51,120
Don't worry.

3533
02:32:51,460 --> 02:32:53,920
I know the one strat.

3534
02:32:58,300 --> 02:32:59,260
Don't worry.

3535
02:33:01,060 --> 02:33:04,640
I will do this until it stops working.

3536
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:13,020
The strat of all time.

3537
02:33:13,220 --> 02:33:15,400
You can't even get up here.

3538
02:33:15,920 --> 02:33:16,480
You can't...

3539
02:33:17,640 --> 02:33:19,960
Bro, you can't even fly up here.

3540
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:24,230
Oh, let me get a little bit higher.

3541
02:33:24,590 --> 02:33:25,470
Let me get...

3542
02:33:25,470 --> 02:33:26,950
Never put it.

3543
02:33:27,130 --> 02:33:27,770
Okay.

3544
02:33:27,870 --> 02:33:30,450
As I was saying, you can't even...

3545
02:33:30,450 --> 02:33:33,110
You can't even get up here.

3546
02:33:33,170 --> 02:33:33,690
Look at this.

3547
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:34,650
Oh my god!

3548
02:33:35,130 --> 02:33:35,770
Oh!

3549
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:36,850
I'm sorry!

3550
02:33:37,230 --> 02:33:37,990
I'm not!

3551
02:33:39,010 --> 02:33:40,090
I didn't...

3552
02:33:40,090 --> 02:33:41,730
I didn't mean that.

3553
02:33:41,750 --> 02:33:42,690
I'm so sorry.

3554
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:44,270
I am not.

3555
02:33:44,570 --> 02:33:45,210
So...

3556
02:33:45,210 --> 02:33:46,390
Holy shit.

3557
02:33:46,670 --> 02:33:47,870
Gus, he got up!

3558
02:33:48,550 --> 02:33:49,150
How?

3559
02:33:49,870 --> 02:33:51,170
He got up!

3560
02:33:51,530 --> 02:33:52,990
What is he doing?

3561
02:33:53,590 --> 02:33:55,090
What is he...

3562
02:33:55,090 --> 02:33:55,790
Okay.

3563
02:33:57,070 --> 02:33:58,270
I'm just like...

3564
02:33:58,270 --> 02:33:59,790
What is he doing?

3565
02:33:59,830 --> 02:34:00,890
He's just flying around.

3566
02:34:01,410 --> 02:34:02,050
All right.

3567
02:34:02,350 --> 02:34:03,290
There we go.

3568
02:34:03,570 --> 02:34:05,250
Now, what you gonna do?

3569
02:34:05,730 --> 02:34:06,330
Nothing.

3570
02:34:07,670 --> 02:34:08,450
That's right.

3571
02:34:08,810 --> 02:34:09,590
Oh, I'm sorry!

3572
02:34:12,610 --> 02:34:14,830
Now, what is he gonna do?

3573
02:34:15,350 --> 02:34:15,950
Nothing.

3574
02:34:16,030 --> 02:34:17,090
Oh, fuck.

3575
02:34:17,170 --> 02:34:17,590
Oh, god.

3576
02:34:17,630 --> 02:34:17,850
Oh, god.

3577
02:34:17,850 --> 02:34:18,270
Oh, god.

3578
02:34:18,350 --> 02:34:19,250
He's looking at me.

3579
02:34:19,330 --> 02:34:19,770
Guys.

3580
02:34:20,110 --> 02:34:20,550
Guys.

3581
02:34:20,830 --> 02:34:21,830
He's looking at me.

3582
02:34:21,870 --> 02:34:23,270
I don't know what to do when he does that.

3583
02:34:23,490 --> 02:34:23,750
I...

3584
02:34:23,750 --> 02:34:25,790
I don't know when he does that.

3585
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:28,470
What?

3586
02:34:28,690 --> 02:34:28,990
What?

3587
02:34:29,010 --> 02:34:29,790
What did he do?

3588
02:34:31,650 --> 02:34:32,410
Like, what?

3589
02:34:33,090 --> 02:34:33,530
What?

3590
02:34:33,590 --> 02:34:33,850
What?

3591
02:34:34,650 --> 02:34:35,090
What?

3592
02:34:35,470 --> 02:34:35,910
What?

3593
02:34:36,190 --> 02:34:36,630
What?

3594
02:34:36,630 --> 02:34:36,830
What?

3595
02:34:37,010 --> 02:34:37,450
What?

3596
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:38,190
What?

3597
02:34:38,190 --> 02:34:38,950
What did you do?

3598
02:34:39,290 --> 02:34:39,730
What?

3599
02:34:40,610 --> 02:34:42,170
Oh, shit.

3600
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:43,830
Oh, no.

3601
02:34:44,270 --> 02:34:45,290
I gotta be angry.

3602
02:34:45,870 --> 02:34:46,690
Now, I'm mad.

3603
02:34:47,390 --> 02:34:47,830
That's it.

3604
02:34:47,830 --> 02:34:48,090
That's fine.

3605
02:34:49,230 --> 02:34:50,190
Angry Kamehameha!

3606
02:34:52,850 --> 02:34:53,590
That's right!

3607
02:34:55,150 --> 02:34:56,470
I'm angry now!

3608
02:35:01,290 --> 02:35:02,570
That's fucking right!

3609
02:35:03,690 --> 02:35:05,690
You don't like it when I make...

3610
02:35:05,690 --> 02:35:06,170
There we go.

3611
02:35:07,830 --> 02:35:10,250
Guys, you shouldn't have taught me the Kamehameha strat.

3612
02:35:10,610 --> 02:35:11,090
I...

3613
02:35:11,090 --> 02:35:11,330
I...

3614
02:35:11,330 --> 02:35:12,930
I don't know why you taught me the...

3615
02:35:13,870 --> 02:35:15,690
Why did you teach me the cheese?

3616
02:35:15,970 --> 02:35:16,450
What?

3617
02:35:16,590 --> 02:35:17,070
Why?

3618
02:35:17,230 --> 02:35:17,810
Why did you teach me the cheese?

3619
02:35:26,250 --> 02:35:26,730
Guys...

3620
02:35:26,730 --> 02:35:29,150
Guys, you shouldn't have taught me the cheese, guys.

3621
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:31,350
Like, you know that's all I'm gonna do now.

3622
02:35:31,650 --> 02:35:32,130
That's...

3623
02:35:32,130 --> 02:35:33,450
That's not like...

3624
02:35:33,450 --> 02:35:35,430
It's for your own good.

3625
02:35:35,970 --> 02:35:36,870
Oh, my God!

3626
02:35:36,930 --> 02:35:38,590
Guys, I unlocked Yamcha!

3627
02:35:41,010 --> 02:35:46,690
Goku loses consciousness after his battle with the androids when he's been given the medicine from Trunks.

3628
02:35:46,690 --> 02:35:48,710
He comes to a few days later.

3629
02:35:49,190 --> 02:35:55,050
During that time, androids 16, 17, 18 awaken, and to make matters worse, a creature named Cell has arrived.

3630
02:35:55,450 --> 02:36:00,050
Seeing the ultimate power is for child number two now.

3631
02:36:00,730 --> 02:36:05,310
It is through absorbing androids 17, 18 that Cell plans to attain his perfect form.

3632
02:36:06,930 --> 02:36:16,670
Now aware of his new foes, Goku enters the Hyperbolic Time Chamber so he can complete a year of training in just a single day.

3633
02:36:16,690 --> 02:36:22,970
I want any chance of winning battles to come, and I need to train hard enough to find a level beyond Super Saiyan.

3634
02:36:23,010 --> 02:36:23,270
Oh, God.

3635
02:36:23,350 --> 02:36:24,670
It's Super Saiyan time.

3636
02:36:25,310 --> 02:36:26,910
Beyond Super Saiyan time.

3637
02:36:27,170 --> 02:36:28,270
Goku explains his...

3638
02:36:28,270 --> 02:36:29,450
Why did the music just stop?

3639
02:36:31,510 --> 02:36:32,690
What the fuck?

3640
02:36:33,110 --> 02:36:34,950
It literally just stopped.

3641
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:36,410
Out of nowhere.

3642
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:38,290
It's starting.

3643
02:36:39,010 --> 02:36:40,450
Piccolo's getting ready to fight.

3644
02:36:41,470 --> 02:36:42,810
Piccolo's getting ready to fight?

3645
02:36:43,250 --> 02:36:44,210
Yeah, but who?

3646
02:36:47,230 --> 02:36:47,750
No.

3647
02:36:48,190 --> 02:36:48,810
Who is it?

3648
02:36:48,830 --> 02:36:50,430
Whoever it is, I can't sense their energy.

3649
02:36:50,630 --> 02:36:52,770
So it's gotta be one of the other androids.

3650
02:36:53,810 --> 02:36:54,630
Stop, Gohan.

3651
02:36:54,790 --> 02:36:55,690
We can't help it.

3652
02:36:55,810 --> 02:36:57,730
We're nowhere near their level right now.

3653
02:36:57,730 --> 02:36:58,910
Gohan, you're literally ten.

3654
02:36:59,410 --> 02:37:00,490
No, not even ten.

3655
02:37:00,550 --> 02:37:01,270
You're literally eight.

3656
02:37:04,940 --> 02:37:05,820
That energy.

3657
02:37:06,860 --> 02:37:08,080
It's gotta be Cell.

3658
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:09,200
Not Cell!

3659
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:11,780
All right, guys.

3660
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:13,040
I need to use the bathroom real quick.

3661
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:13,760
Oh, shit.

3662
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:14,620
Okay, guys.

3663
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:15,240
I'll be right back.

3664
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:14,480
Guys, okay.

3665
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:16,700
I can do...

3666
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:16,940
I can do...

3667
02:40:16,940 --> 02:40:19,600
I need to pick up one more game, because I need to pick up Dad.

3668
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:22,340
I need to pick up Dad.

3669
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:23,520
So I'll do...

3670
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:25,060
Which one is the alternate...

3671
02:40:25,060 --> 02:40:25,640
Wait for...

3672
02:40:25,960 --> 02:40:26,580
Guys, I forgot.

3673
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:29,580
Which one is the what-if scenario?

3674
02:40:29,980 --> 02:40:32,440
Go for help or wait for Vegeta and Trunks?

3675
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:39,140
Which one is it?

3676
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:40,180
Go help?

3677
02:40:40,360 --> 02:40:41,780
Go and help is the what-if?

3678
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:46,640
Go and help is what-if.

3679
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:46,900
Okay.

3680
02:40:47,720 --> 02:40:48,340
Don't worry.

3681
02:40:49,340 --> 02:40:52,340
If I use my instant transmission, I might be able to get out of here.

3682
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:53,540
I might be able to get Piccolo out of there!

3683
02:40:54,740 --> 02:40:55,460
Don't worry.

3684
02:40:55,500 --> 02:40:56,460
Piccolo got you!

3685
02:40:58,400 --> 02:40:59,220
Thanks, Dad!

3686
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:01,040
Please save him!

3687
02:41:01,820 --> 02:41:02,940
Don't worry, Gohan.

3688
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:04,300
I'll save your real dad.

3689
02:41:17,450 --> 02:41:18,210
Don't worry.

3690
02:41:20,970 --> 02:41:21,490
Wait.

3691
02:41:21,570 --> 02:41:22,470
I'm in the canon event?

3692
02:41:23,470 --> 02:41:24,730
Guys, what the fuck?

3693
02:41:26,830 --> 02:41:27,350
Guys!

3694
02:41:27,450 --> 02:41:29,110
And you called me the fake...

3695
02:41:29,110 --> 02:41:29,550
Oh!

3696
02:41:29,570 --> 02:41:30,090
Hahaha!

3697
02:41:34,430 --> 02:41:37,730
Just as they arrive, Piccolo is attacked and morally wounded by Cell.

3698
02:41:38,430 --> 02:41:39,510
Oh, it's not Cat.

3699
02:41:39,570 --> 02:41:39,850
Guys!

3700
02:41:42,090 --> 02:41:44,050
There's a lot of fake fans in my chat!

3701
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:45,830
At least I'm...

3702
02:41:45,830 --> 02:41:49,550
At least I admit that I don't remember certain things.

3703
02:41:57,690 --> 02:42:00,490
What's his energy, Gohan?

3704
02:42:03,570 --> 02:42:05,050
Yeah, fucking barely.

3705
02:42:05,230 --> 02:42:05,910
Look at him.

3706
02:42:06,170 --> 02:42:08,410
He's like literally gonna die.

3707
02:42:17,490 --> 02:42:18,090
Alright.

3708
02:42:18,290 --> 02:42:19,150
Alright, Gohan.

3709
02:42:19,950 --> 02:42:20,990
Watch your down.

3710
02:42:21,010 --> 02:42:22,950
Gohan, don't let your dad not get beat up like your fake dad.

3711
02:42:23,230 --> 02:42:25,170
This is why I'm a real dad, Gohan.

3712
02:42:25,510 --> 02:42:27,430
You try to say Gohan...

3713
02:42:27,430 --> 02:42:29,670
Piccolo's your real dad when look at him.

3714
02:42:29,730 --> 02:42:31,030
He fucking almost died.

3715
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:54,170
Cell looks really good in this game.

3716
02:43:01,970 --> 02:43:02,450
Alright.

3717
02:43:02,690 --> 02:43:03,350
Don't worry.

3718
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:04,310
It's time.

3719
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:07,850
Oh shit.

3720
02:43:07,970 --> 02:43:08,570
Oh shit.

3721
02:43:08,630 --> 02:43:09,110
Oh shit.

3722
02:43:09,150 --> 02:43:09,770
I think he knows.

3723
02:43:12,150 --> 02:43:13,530
He knows the strat.

3724
02:43:13,690 --> 02:43:15,930
The other AIs told him about my strat.

3725
02:43:16,270 --> 02:43:18,010
The other AIs told him!

3726
02:43:18,870 --> 02:43:19,810
No, there's no way.

3727
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:20,530
No, they didn't.

3728
02:43:20,530 --> 02:43:21,410
They didn't tell him everything.

3729
02:43:21,770 --> 02:43:22,950
They didn't tell him everything.

3730
02:43:24,690 --> 02:43:25,390
Don't worry.

3731
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:29,590
The other AIs didn't tell him everything.

3732
02:43:31,190 --> 02:43:32,650
They did tell him everything!

3733
02:43:32,930 --> 02:43:33,670
This is it!

3734
02:43:34,230 --> 02:43:35,950
I can still abuse it!

3735
02:43:37,410 --> 02:43:38,870
I can still abuse it!

3736
02:43:43,330 --> 02:43:44,650
That's fucking right!

3737
02:43:46,730 --> 02:43:50,030
I cannot allow number 17 to be absorbed.

3738
02:43:50,450 --> 02:43:51,330
This is it!

3739
02:43:51,490 --> 02:43:53,050
You're actually gonna fight two?

3740
02:43:53,050 --> 02:43:57,110
By my calculations, Cell and I are approximately equal in size.

3741
02:43:57,110 --> 02:43:57,830
That's what you're gonna do?

3742
02:43:57,890 --> 02:43:59,010
Get closer to me?

3743
02:44:02,450 --> 02:44:02,930
That's...

3744
02:44:02,930 --> 02:44:05,310
What the fuck?

3745
02:44:05,330 --> 02:44:06,070
I'm so far.

3746
02:44:06,450 --> 02:44:08,070
Like, what are you trying to do?

3747
02:44:08,130 --> 02:44:09,490
I'm so fucking far.

3748
02:44:09,750 --> 02:44:10,350
Yeah, that's right.

3749
02:44:10,410 --> 02:44:11,070
Get closer.

3750
02:44:11,310 --> 02:44:12,270
Get closer.

3751
02:44:12,270 --> 02:44:13,710
Get hit by that bitch.

3752
02:44:13,770 --> 02:44:14,730
Oh shit.

3753
02:44:14,830 --> 02:44:15,090
Okay.

3754
02:44:15,150 --> 02:44:15,510
I'm sorry.

3755
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:16,170
Oh my god.

3756
02:44:16,210 --> 02:44:16,510
I'm sorry.

3757
02:44:17,370 --> 02:44:18,550
I'm not sorry.

3758
02:44:18,830 --> 02:44:20,930
Because I know you never learn.

3759
02:44:21,970 --> 02:44:23,370
You don't learn!

3760
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:27,030
Oh shit!

3761
02:44:27,170 --> 02:44:28,230
What the fuck?

3762
02:44:29,630 --> 02:44:30,190
What?

3763
02:44:33,430 --> 02:44:34,530
How is he not dead?

3764
02:44:34,810 --> 02:44:36,110
Okay, now he's actually dead.

3765
02:44:36,210 --> 02:44:36,370
Okay.

3766
02:44:41,950 --> 02:44:43,230
We did it.

3767
02:44:43,650 --> 02:44:44,750
We did it.

3768
02:44:44,750 --> 02:44:44,770
We did it.

3769
02:44:45,170 --> 02:44:45,270
We did it.

3770
02:44:45,310 --> 02:44:45,530
We did it.

3771
02:44:47,070 --> 02:44:47,630
Yeah!

3772
02:44:47,970 --> 02:44:48,270
Yeah!

3773
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:55,520
And that's how Goku beats every villain.

3774
02:44:56,120 --> 02:44:59,440
Guys, all I'm saying is you shouldn't have taught me the cheese.

3775
02:45:02,740 --> 02:45:04,300
That's all I'm saying.

3776
02:45:06,320 --> 02:45:08,260
We couldn't have avoided this.

3777
02:45:08,520 --> 02:45:11,860
Goku and friends have successfully defeated Cell.

3778
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:18,980
Since their common enemy has been done away with, the androids returned to the original objective.

3779
02:45:18,980 --> 02:45:21,200
They're about to kill Goku.

3780
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:26,540
However, the androids have suffered damage from their battle with Cell.

3781
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:29,680
Oh shit.

3782
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:29,920
What?

3783
02:45:30,140 --> 02:45:30,240
Listen.

3784
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:32,880
Your bodies are way too injured to be fighting right now.

3785
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:34,160
I'm not going anywhere.

3786
02:45:34,160 --> 02:45:35,300
Goku beats Cell.

3787
02:45:35,320 --> 02:45:36,720
Cell Saga has ended.

3788
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:37,280
So why don't you rest up and do this another time?

3789
02:45:41,870 --> 02:45:45,010
What the hell are you talking about?

3790
02:45:45,290 --> 02:45:47,070
These little scrapes are nothing.

3791
02:45:47,230 --> 02:45:49,130
We could still take you easy.

3792
02:45:49,130 --> 02:45:51,770
What the fuck was wrong with his lip sync?

3793
02:45:55,970 --> 02:45:57,470
Don't throw me any sympathy.

3794
02:45:57,930 --> 02:45:58,730
I have no sympathy.

3795
02:46:00,050 --> 02:46:01,410
What the fuck?

3796
02:46:02,130 --> 02:46:03,630
What's that supposed to mean?

3797
02:46:04,410 --> 02:46:06,110
Look at his lip syncing!

3798
02:46:09,690 --> 02:46:11,830
He's just very angry, Doki.

3799
02:46:12,090 --> 02:46:16,090
Well, not naming numbers, but one of us was hogging all the action and ended up with a couple...

3800
02:46:16,090 --> 02:46:16,470
He's angry!

3801
02:46:16,910 --> 02:46:18,310
He's so angry.

3802
02:46:18,310 --> 02:46:19,310
Stretch your legs.

3803
02:46:21,150 --> 02:46:22,030
Yeah, whatever.

3804
02:46:22,350 --> 02:46:22,930
Okay, look!

3805
02:46:23,010 --> 02:46:23,710
That's normal!

3806
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:27,290
You have any problems with that, 16?

3807
02:46:29,230 --> 02:46:29,670
Negative.

3808
02:46:31,350 --> 02:46:31,790
Good.

3809
02:46:31,790 --> 02:46:33,310
Glad we're on the same page.

3810
02:46:33,530 --> 02:46:33,910
Oh, yeah.

3811
02:46:34,250 --> 02:46:35,450
What was the what if sentence?

3812
02:46:35,490 --> 02:46:35,910
That's it?

3813
02:46:36,490 --> 02:46:38,330
Would you let me take this worm mail?

3814
02:46:38,330 --> 02:46:39,130
Alright, I'll do this one too.

3815
02:46:39,550 --> 02:46:40,470
I'll do this fight.

3816
02:46:40,610 --> 02:46:43,130
I literally have like 12 minutes left, but I'll do this fight too.

3817
02:46:43,390 --> 02:46:44,570
Just be careful, Goku.

3818
02:46:48,350 --> 02:46:49,850
He's no longer angry.

3819
02:46:50,330 --> 02:46:50,810
Alright.

3820
02:46:51,430 --> 02:46:52,430
Watch this.

3821
02:46:54,370 --> 02:46:55,330
Oh, shit!

3822
02:46:55,690 --> 02:46:56,530
Oh, shit!

3823
02:46:56,630 --> 02:46:57,170
Don't worry.

3824
02:46:57,410 --> 02:46:58,230
You can't do that forever.

3825
02:46:58,890 --> 02:46:59,230
No way!

3826
02:46:59,590 --> 02:47:03,530
You being as strong as you are is actually why I want to fight you one on one!

3827
02:47:03,610 --> 02:47:04,110
Oh, shit!

3828
02:47:04,230 --> 02:47:05,730
How are you strong as...

3829
02:47:05,730 --> 02:47:06,470
Okay, don't worry.

3830
02:47:06,650 --> 02:47:07,270
Matches up with yours.

3831
02:47:07,470 --> 02:47:07,950
That's all.

3832
02:47:08,270 --> 02:47:09,330
I'm not done yet.

3833
02:47:09,530 --> 02:47:10,890
Don't start getting ahead of yourself.

3834
02:47:11,170 --> 02:47:11,310
It's fine.

3835
02:47:11,310 --> 02:47:11,810
She flew down.

3836
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:12,770
It's fine.

3837
02:47:12,810 --> 02:47:13,870
She flew down, guys.

3838
02:47:14,170 --> 02:47:14,650
She...

3839
02:47:15,310 --> 02:47:15,590
18.

3840
02:47:15,650 --> 02:47:17,030
I'm in love with it.

3841
02:47:17,030 --> 02:47:18,190
Okay.

3842
02:47:18,190 --> 02:47:18,650
Here we go.

3843
02:47:18,910 --> 02:47:19,630
Alright.

3844
02:47:19,630 --> 02:47:20,250
What you gonna do?

3845
02:47:20,330 --> 02:47:20,410
Huh?

3846
02:47:20,710 --> 02:47:22,170
What you gonna do?!

3847
02:47:22,170 --> 02:47:23,370
Nothing!!

3848
02:47:23,370 --> 02:47:24,530
That's right!

3849
02:47:25,390 --> 02:47:26,350
That's really not...

3850
02:47:27,270 --> 02:47:29,110
What you're gonna do?!?

3851
02:47:29,110 --> 02:47:32,630
You have to reach me first!!

3852
02:47:32,630 --> 02:47:35,150
That's right!!!

3853
02:47:37,570 --> 02:47:40,850
Can't even get out of the water!

3854
02:47:42,910 --> 02:47:44,350
That's right!!!

3855
02:47:44,350 --> 02:47:46,830
OOOOOOOH, OH MY GOD!

3856
02:47:46,830 --> 02:47:47,010
WHAT?!

3857
02:47:47,010 --> 02:47:47,430
I'm sorry!

3858
02:47:47,550 --> 02:47:48,610
You're so beautiful!

3859
02:47:49,670 --> 02:47:50,750
I'm so sorry!

3860
02:47:51,090 --> 02:47:52,410
I'm not sorry!

3861
02:47:53,570 --> 02:47:55,590
I'll never be sorry!

3862
02:47:56,170 --> 02:47:57,550
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3863
02:47:58,070 --> 02:47:58,690
Wait a minute.

3864
02:47:59,490 --> 02:47:59,810
Pew!

3865
02:48:00,610 --> 02:48:02,310
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

3866
02:48:02,450 --> 02:48:02,930
Oh, shit!

3867
02:48:03,190 --> 02:48:05,850
I wanted it to be... pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

3868
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:07,630
Wait, wait, I can kill her with this.

3869
02:48:07,670 --> 02:48:08,050
Watch this.

3870
02:48:08,350 --> 02:48:09,590
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

3871
02:48:09,610 --> 02:48:10,190
Oh, god!

3872
02:48:10,290 --> 02:48:10,810
Oh, god!

3873
02:48:11,070 --> 02:48:11,670
Pew, pew, pew!

3874
02:48:12,970 --> 02:48:16,610
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

3875
02:48:16,610 --> 02:48:17,150
Wait, wait.

3876
02:48:17,350 --> 02:48:17,870
Yeah!

3877
02:48:20,850 --> 02:48:22,350
The Vegeta technique!

3878
02:48:26,110 --> 02:48:26,630
Easy.

3879
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:27,770
So easy.

3880
02:48:30,110 --> 02:48:30,630
Cool!

3881
02:48:31,010 --> 02:48:31,950
The cheese!

3882
02:48:34,570 --> 02:48:37,510
How could you kick her like that!?

3883
02:48:39,150 --> 02:48:41,190
You don't fear your power, Goku!

3884
02:48:41,190 --> 02:48:44,530
Goku taunts Android 18, all while remaining perfectly calm.

3885
02:48:44,770 --> 02:48:47,090
That allows them to gain advantage in their fight.

3886
02:48:48,390 --> 02:48:52,090
Android 18 soon realizes she is losing and decides to abandon her fight with Goku.

3887
02:48:54,150 --> 02:48:54,670
Ugh.

3888
02:48:54,670 --> 02:48:55,490
That's enough.

3889
02:48:55,850 --> 02:48:57,170
Now my clothes are dirty.

3890
02:48:57,170 --> 02:48:59,010
No, I ruined her- I dirtied up her face!

3891
02:48:59,670 --> 02:49:00,370
Wait, you're done?

3892
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:01,470
No!

3893
02:49:01,550 --> 02:49:02,090
That was so quick!

3894
02:49:03,570 --> 02:49:07,270
Untouchable as I am, I don't get that much of a kick out of fighting.

3895
02:49:08,330 --> 02:49:10,230
Had enough time to lick your wounds?

3896
02:49:12,230 --> 02:49:15,350
You know androids don't run out of energy like that.

3897
02:49:15,490 --> 02:49:16,430
I swear.

3898
02:49:16,670 --> 02:49:17,570
You're the naggiest sibling in the world.

3899
02:49:17,570 --> 02:49:20,670
I like OceanDub's voice for Android 17 more.

3900
02:49:20,770 --> 02:49:21,970
I don't like this guy's voice.

3901
02:49:22,230 --> 02:49:26,510
This is the first time I heard Android 17's voice in the new dub.

3902
02:49:26,670 --> 02:49:30,150
And I think OceanDub's voice for him is a lot better.

3903
02:49:30,490 --> 02:49:31,550
Gotta say, Goku.

3904
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:35,030
You're as impressive a martial artist as the doctor said.

3905
02:49:35,530 --> 02:49:36,050
That.

3906
02:49:36,050 --> 02:49:39,070
And you're not nearly as annoying as that hothead, Vegeta.

3907
02:49:40,230 --> 02:49:43,570
You kept your cool throughout that whole fight with 18 too.

3908
02:49:43,930 --> 02:49:48,930
Making an android with unlimited energy sweat- I'm just an OceanDub- THAT'S RIGHT!

3909
02:49:49,530 --> 02:49:50,890
I AM!

3910
02:49:55,410 --> 02:49:56,590
That's right!

3911
02:49:57,310 --> 02:49:58,490
I am!

3912
02:49:59,130 --> 02:50:06,210
And I'll never- I'll never- And I'll fight every other dub.

3913
02:50:07,390 --> 02:50:08,130
Stop.

3914
02:50:10,850 --> 02:50:13,890
That's right... it's all we had.

3915
02:50:14,270 --> 02:50:16,530
It was literally all that we had.

3916
02:50:16,910 --> 02:50:18,010
But it was perfect.

3917
02:50:18,570 --> 02:50:19,770
Oh my God!

3918
02:50:19,950 --> 02:50:21,410
He learned from 18.

3919
02:50:22,470 --> 02:50:23,110
How?!

3920
02:50:23,110 --> 02:50:26,150
You were supposed to let me cheese you!

3921
02:50:26,850 --> 02:50:32,330
You were- And- JK,, nevermind.

3922
02:50:32,670 --> 02:50:33,390
It's working.

3923
02:50:33,630 --> 02:50:35,610
As soon as I pick him up in the water you can't do anything.

3924
02:50:36,010 --> 02:50:41,570
As soon- As soon as- He's watching Doki, of course he knows.

3925
02:50:41,850 --> 02:50:44,710
He literally watched the entire fight, Doki.

3926
02:50:45,070 --> 02:50:46,450
Like, what's he supposed to do?

3927
02:50:46,510 --> 02:50:47,190
Not watch?

3928
02:50:47,630 --> 02:50:49,070
Yeah, because that's rude.

3929
02:50:49,210 --> 02:50:50,530
It was a private fight.

3930
02:50:50,990 --> 02:50:52,050
Oh no, he's in the air.

3931
02:50:52,230 --> 02:50:54,630
Don't worry, I got the skybox now.

3932
02:50:54,850 --> 02:50:55,410
This is mine.

3933
02:50:55,710 --> 02:50:56,570
Wait, what are you doing?

3934
02:50:56,750 --> 02:50:58,650
That's right, you know you're beneath me.

3935
02:50:59,190 --> 02:51:00,310
That's fucking right.

3936
02:51:00,350 --> 02:51:01,350
Get down!

3937
02:51:02,190 --> 02:51:05,970
You know damn well you're beneath me.

3938
02:51:09,970 --> 02:51:11,330
Oh, I'm so sorry.

3939
02:51:11,390 --> 02:51:12,570
I'm so sorry.

3940
02:51:12,690 --> 02:51:14,710
I'm so sorry.

3941
02:51:14,790 --> 02:51:15,390
I'm not.

3942
02:51:15,450 --> 02:51:16,330
Oh my god.

3943
02:51:16,370 --> 02:51:17,130
Okay, I am sorry.

3944
02:51:18,550 --> 02:51:19,510
Where am I?

3945
02:51:20,430 --> 02:51:20,870
Good.

3946
02:51:23,890 --> 02:51:25,210
Unless I go first.

3947
02:51:28,230 --> 02:51:30,530
You can't finish this if I'm here first.

3948
02:51:31,290 --> 02:51:32,050
God damn it.

3949
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:32,730
Get over here.

3950
02:51:32,950 --> 02:51:33,770
Get over here.

3951
02:51:33,830 --> 02:51:34,910
I'll punch you with my hands now.

3952
02:51:35,010 --> 02:51:36,390
I know how much HP I have.

3953
02:51:37,170 --> 02:51:39,010
You thought you're better than me?

3954
02:51:39,510 --> 02:51:40,450
Alright, punch me.

3955
02:51:40,510 --> 02:51:41,410
That's fucking right.

3956
02:51:43,490 --> 02:51:44,690
Oh shit.

3957
02:51:45,550 --> 02:51:46,310
That's fine.

3958
02:51:48,250 --> 02:51:50,330
Now I can Kamehameha.

3959
02:51:53,490 --> 02:51:55,890
Only let my guard down for a second.

3960
02:51:56,290 --> 02:51:57,530
So easy.

3961
02:52:00,430 --> 02:52:01,630
So easy.

3962
02:52:02,090 --> 02:52:02,990
Look at that.

3963
02:52:06,480 --> 02:52:07,880
I actually fought.

3964
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:08,280
Look at that!

3965
02:52:08,340 --> 02:52:09,120
I used my hands!

3966
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:12,700
Oh wait, he's happy.

3967
02:52:12,980 --> 02:52:16,140
Realizing he can't defeat Goku, Android 17 lowers his guard.

3968
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:18,140
However, his expression seems somewhat pleased.

3969
02:52:18,760 --> 02:52:21,840
Android 17 who had searched for Goku as if it were a game.

3970
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:24,120
Feels like he had enough fun with that fight.

3971
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:27,100
I think I'm a little burnt out on all the fighting.

3972
02:52:27,180 --> 02:52:28,280
Takaya, thank you for the super chat.

3973
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:28,540
Thank you.

3974
02:52:28,800 --> 02:52:29,340
Thank you.

3975
02:52:31,060 --> 02:52:33,700
Those are Android 17's words to Android 16 and 18.

3976
02:52:36,080 --> 02:52:39,120
Android 16's gaze remained displeased as he stares at Goku.

3977
02:52:40,560 --> 02:52:41,000
Why?

3978
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:41,440
Why?

3979
02:52:41,980 --> 02:52:42,640
What's the deal?

3980
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:43,900
We going or what?

3981
02:52:44,100 --> 02:52:45,920
What did I do wrong, 16?

3982
02:52:47,420 --> 02:52:47,940
What?

3983
02:52:52,120 --> 02:52:53,720
I saved your life, bro.

3984
02:52:53,940 --> 02:52:56,180
16, what got into you all of a sudden?

3985
02:52:56,480 --> 02:52:57,460
You look pissed.

3986
02:52:58,360 --> 02:52:59,740
Yeah, what did I do?

3987
02:53:01,640 --> 02:53:07,060
My mission is to kill Goku and I intend to accomplish it.

3988
02:53:07,720 --> 02:53:08,720
Dude, chill.

3989
02:53:09,380 --> 02:53:09,900
Bro.

3990
02:53:12,140 --> 02:53:13,040
What is that?

3991
02:53:13,060 --> 02:53:13,600
What's that actually?

3992
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:17,180
There's no way that was in the anime.

3993
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:18,120
Bro.

3994
02:53:18,260 --> 02:53:19,300
Dude, chill.

3995
02:53:21,620 --> 02:53:22,820
Dude, wait.

3996
02:53:23,100 --> 02:53:24,340
What's that thing?

3997
02:53:26,820 --> 02:53:27,420
Dude.

3998
02:53:29,320 --> 02:53:30,980
Oh, this is the what if.

3999
02:53:31,500 --> 02:53:33,320
There's no way.

4000
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:37,300
I was going to say there's no way.

4001
02:53:39,100 --> 02:53:40,560
Bro, dude, chill.

4002
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:41,360
Dude.

4003
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:43,180
That's so...

4004
02:53:46,300 --> 02:53:48,340
That's so good, though.

4005
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:49,560
I'm sorry.

4006
02:53:49,700 --> 02:53:51,980
That's actually so funny, bro.

4007
02:53:53,060 --> 02:53:54,100
Bro, chill, bro.

4008
02:53:59,040 --> 02:53:59,780
I know.

4009
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:03,020
It's pretty much on brand, but it's such a funny line.

4010
02:54:03,480 --> 02:54:04,780
Wait, do I get this off first?

4011
02:54:05,020 --> 02:54:05,620
I think I do.

4012
02:54:06,380 --> 02:54:07,280
Yeah, that's right.

4013
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:08,000
Enough what, huh?

4014
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:09,920
Enough what, huh?

4015
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:10,680
Oh!

4016
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:11,520
It's okay.

4017
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:12,260
I can charge this up.

4018
02:54:12,380 --> 02:54:12,920
Oh, it's okay.

4019
02:54:12,920 --> 02:54:13,240
You can...

4020
02:54:13,240 --> 02:54:14,120
It's fine.

4021
02:54:14,220 --> 02:54:14,960
You can still hit me.

4022
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:17,400
That's right.

4023
02:54:19,280 --> 02:54:20,080
That's right.

4024
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:23,140
That's right.

4025
02:54:23,440 --> 02:54:24,940
What you gonna do?

4026
02:54:26,180 --> 02:54:29,140
This is the only thing I know how to...

4027
02:54:34,940 --> 02:54:36,080
Don't let him grab me.

4028
02:54:36,400 --> 02:54:37,060
Get away.

4029
02:54:37,720 --> 02:54:38,380
Get away.

4030
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,060
Chat told me I can't let you grab me.

4031
02:54:42,120 --> 02:54:42,840
Get away.

4032
02:54:44,300 --> 02:54:45,060
Get away.

4033
02:54:47,140 --> 02:54:49,500
Look, fighting games is all about fighting.

4034
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:50,380
The spam.

4035
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:53,260
I'm just doing what I'm supposed to be doing guys.

4036
02:54:54,300 --> 02:54:55,280
Where is he?

4037
02:54:55,440 --> 02:54:57,280
Oh, where did he go?

4038
02:54:58,140 --> 02:54:59,080
Did I get it?

4039
02:54:59,500 --> 02:55:00,180
Is he.

4040
02:55:02,180 --> 02:55:03,180
Where is he?

4041
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:06,500
Bro.

4042
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:08,120
Oh, wait.

4043
02:55:09,220 --> 02:55:10,300
He's over there.

4044
02:55:10,540 --> 02:55:11,040
He is which gets him...ически.

4045
02:55:11,060 --> 02:55:13,400
I'm just like, is he okay?

4046
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:16,180
Is he okay?

4047
02:55:16,760 --> 02:55:18,580
Are you gonna come over?

4048
02:55:20,810 --> 02:55:21,740
Is he... hello?

4049
02:55:23,080 --> 02:55:23,700
Hello?

4050
02:55:23,780 --> 02:55:25,760
Oh shit!

4051
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:28,140
Oh shit!

4052
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:30,020
That's not how he gave up!

4053
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:32,320
Oh my god, he actually...

4054
02:55:32,910 --> 02:55:34,400
Guys, I did not expect that.

4055
02:55:35,020 --> 02:55:36,840
I did not expect that.

4056
02:55:37,500 --> 02:55:38,300
Oh no!

4057
02:55:38,300 --> 02:55:38,460
No!

4058
02:55:38,720 --> 02:55:39,240
No!

4059
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:40,400
No, don't grab me!

4060
02:55:40,460 --> 02:55:41,880
Don't grab me, I'm so scared!

4061
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:43,660
Don't grab me, please!

4062
02:55:44,580 --> 02:55:45,800
Oh my god!

4063
02:55:47,020 --> 02:55:47,540
Bro!

4064
02:55:48,500 --> 02:55:49,020
Bro!

4065
02:55:49,820 --> 02:55:50,340
Oh!

4066
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:54,940
You can?

4067
02:55:56,540 --> 02:55:57,500
Oh god, okay.

4068
02:55:58,120 --> 02:55:58,780
It's okay.

4069
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:02,000
You can't read this though!

4070
02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:03,900
Even though I did it 20 times!

4071
02:56:04,240 --> 02:56:05,800
You still can't read this!

4072
02:56:06,340 --> 02:56:07,520
You're so stupid!

4073
02:56:08,460 --> 02:56:12,080
If you can read my movement, why still haven't you predicted this?

4074
02:56:12,800 --> 02:56:14,600
Give me your energy, everybody!

4075
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:20,640
Give me your energy, everybody!

4076
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:21,620
That's fucking right.

4077
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:23,220
That's fucking right!

4078
02:56:24,700 --> 02:56:25,860
That's fucking right!

4079
02:56:27,060 --> 02:56:28,800
I'm so excited now!

4080
02:56:32,100 --> 02:56:32,920
That's right!

4081
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:34,280
Oh shit!

4082
02:56:34,560 --> 02:56:36,100
I'm sorry.

4083
02:56:36,460 --> 02:56:37,520
I'm so sorry.

4084
02:56:38,300 --> 02:56:40,280
But can you do... can you dodge this?

4085
02:56:40,740 --> 02:56:40,960
Oh!

4086
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:46,240
It all comes down to this.

4087
02:56:46,420 --> 02:56:47,300
Get in the water.

4088
02:56:49,020 --> 02:56:49,500
Yay!

4089
02:56:50,980 --> 02:56:52,040
I get it!

4090
02:56:52,420 --> 02:56:56,800
If you're not, if you're not, if you're not, if you're not, if you're not, if you're not, you're gonna die a thousand times.

4091
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:02,300
Don't you dare, 16.

4092
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:04,800
I'm not letting you blow yourself up.

4093
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:06,700
That's right.

4094
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:08,920
Now you die in the water.

4095
02:57:10,700 --> 02:57:11,680
Don't tell me.

4096
02:57:11,800 --> 02:57:16,300
You have a self-destruct device I'm disassociating from this Kamehameha voice.

4097
02:57:17,300 --> 02:57:17,860
I'm disassociating from this Kamehameha voice.

4098
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:19,740
Why would I make it harder for myself?

4099
02:57:20,300 --> 02:57:21,480
Why would I make it harder for myself?

4100
02:57:21,480 --> 02:57:23,040
I told you both before.

4101
02:57:23,320 --> 02:57:24,640
I told you both before.

4102
02:57:24,640 --> 02:57:25,780
My mission is to kill Goku.

4103
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:27,180
At any cost.

4104
02:57:28,140 --> 02:57:29,740
Then why haven't you already?

4105
02:57:30,040 --> 02:57:30,240
Yeah.

4106
02:57:30,520 --> 02:57:33,280
You could wipe this entire island off the map with that explosion.

4107
02:57:33,300 --> 02:57:33,800
Exactly.

4108
02:57:38,240 --> 02:57:39,380
He's just tsundere.

4109
02:57:39,660 --> 02:57:40,020
That's enough!

4110
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:42,760
You can't beat me in the state you're in now.

4111
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:43,760
Exactly.

4112
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:48,840
And besides, you don't really seem like a bad guy.

4113
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:57,880
Even if you're technically a robot, I can feel your intent to kill.

4114
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:01,860
But if it really is your mission, why didn't you go for it trying to find a cell?

4115
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:06,260
Instead, you chose to defend your fellow androids.

4116
02:58:06,380 --> 02:58:07,360
Which means...

4117
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:09,520
It's simple.

4118
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:12,260
For the birds.

4119
02:58:12,280 --> 02:58:15,660
There is much wildlife living all around this island.

4120
02:58:16,140 --> 02:58:20,400
I did not want to obstruct nature with the fallout of our battles.

4121
02:58:20,780 --> 02:58:22,720
So, Oh my god.

4122
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:25,600
But hear me, Goku.

4123
02:58:25,860 --> 02:58:26,140
Nerd!

4124
02:58:29,820 --> 02:58:33,140
One day, when you're in your bathroom, you will never expect me.

4125
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:38,180
I took care not to harm any innocent life, animal nor human.

4126
02:58:38,680 --> 02:58:40,680
I believe you are both good people.

4127
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:41,160
Whatever.

4128
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:44,480
When you close your eyes, I'm gonna be there outside the window, Goku.

4129
02:58:44,740 --> 02:58:46,460
I have enjoyed traveling together.

4130
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:50,500
Well, who says we can't still keep doing it?

4131
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:51,880
Then you know what?

4132
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:54,100
Let's have our first stop by the mall.

4133
02:58:54,340 --> 02:58:55,760
By the mall?

4134
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:57,280
Where do you have the money?

4135
02:59:01,560 --> 02:59:03,360
By the fucking mall?

4136
02:59:03,620 --> 02:59:05,360
It looks like the battle is over.

4137
02:59:07,380 --> 02:59:07,940
Yup.

4138
02:59:08,500 --> 02:59:09,060
Goku!

4139
02:59:09,400 --> 02:59:11,660
Let's all go to the mall today.

4140
02:59:12,620 --> 02:59:13,500
Where's Cell?

4141
02:59:13,740 --> 02:59:15,020
And the androids?

4142
02:59:15,280 --> 02:59:16,800
And 18?

4143
02:59:18,160 --> 02:59:20,520
You didn't beat them all already, did you?

4144
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:23,640
Well, I think they'll be back.

4145
02:59:24,560 --> 02:59:26,720
Gohan, this is why I'm your real dad.

4146
02:59:26,840 --> 02:59:28,440
Not this pussy ass Piccolo shit.

4147
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:29,520
What?

4148
02:59:31,180 --> 02:59:33,200
I nearly beat up four people.

4149
02:59:33,280 --> 02:59:34,760
Piccolo got beat up by one.

4150
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:38,800
In the wake of Cell's defeat, the three androids depart.

4151
02:59:39,580 --> 02:59:41,420
Peace is once again restored.

4152
02:59:41,420 --> 02:59:42,340
Oh yeah, Krillin, sorry.

4153
02:59:42,600 --> 02:59:44,920
You're not gonna have a girlfriend or a wife now.

4154
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:45,440
I'm sorry.

4155
02:59:47,120 --> 02:59:50,000
In this timeline, Krillin never finds a wife.

4156
02:59:50,180 --> 02:59:54,260
Someday, these powerful artificial humans may show their faces again.

4157
02:59:54,260 --> 02:59:55,300
No, it's life!

4158
02:59:55,740 --> 02:59:57,180
We did it!

4159
02:59:57,220 --> 02:59:58,380
The perfect ending!

4160
02:59:59,180 --> 03:00:02,600
Now Gohan respects me as a real dad.

4161
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:05,060
And Krillin never gets laid.

4162
03:00:05,960 --> 03:00:09,720
Whatever the outcome, Goku is sure to be stronger than ever.

4163
03:00:09,720 --> 03:00:11,160
Krillin loses in this timeline.

4164
03:00:12,720 --> 03:00:15,540
This is the worst time.

4165
03:00:15,700 --> 03:00:16,780
It's the best time!

4166
03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:17,700
The timeline for Goku!

4167
03:00:18,900 --> 03:00:19,420
It's...

4168
03:00:21,260 --> 03:00:23,440
Goku gets the best ending!

4169
03:00:24,260 --> 03:00:25,140
Alright, guys.

4170
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:27,320
GG everybody.

4171
03:00:27,560 --> 03:00:30,940
I actually have to stop because I need to pick up my dog.

4172
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:32,860
But it was fun.

4173
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:33,640
It was fun.

4174
03:00:33,660 --> 03:00:34,560
I had a good time playing.

4175
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:36,660
I think I might try the Kakarot.

4176
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:42,000
I think like, honestly, I think I would prefer playing the Kakarot game.

4177
03:00:42,300 --> 03:00:44,600
I think because this one is like...

4178
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:47,180
I want to enjoy the story more.

4179
03:00:47,440 --> 03:00:48,560
Like, relive the story.

4180
03:00:49,300 --> 03:00:51,000
But it has been fun.

4181
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:53,820
It has been fun.

4182
03:00:53,940 --> 03:00:55,900
Stop spamming and learn!

4183
03:00:56,420 --> 03:00:59,300
But it works though!

4184
03:01:02,420 --> 03:01:03,820
But it works!

4185
03:01:12,820 --> 03:01:13,860
It works!

4186
03:01:13,860 --> 03:01:16,400
Yeah, this was more of a fighting game based.

4187
03:01:16,520 --> 03:01:18,660
But then I just kept commenting on it.

4188
03:01:20,740 --> 03:01:23,120
You guys should have taught me the cheese.

4189
03:01:23,400 --> 03:01:24,240
You guys...

4190
03:01:27,280 --> 03:01:31,520
If I didn't know the cheese I would have never done this.

4191
03:01:35,660 --> 03:01:38,700
The AI could have learned but it didn't.

4192
03:01:38,700 --> 03:01:39,700
It's not my fault.

4193
03:01:39,900 --> 03:01:42,080
The AI didn't catch up in time.

4194
03:01:42,480 --> 03:01:43,940
But I had a great time.

4195
03:01:44,020 --> 03:01:45,720
So I was really unhinged earlier, guys.

4196
03:01:47,160 --> 03:01:49,040
Sick Doki Bird is...

4197
03:01:49,720 --> 03:01:53,760
Sick Doki Bird gets really unhinged.

4198
03:01:54,640 --> 03:01:57,740
And a little unfiltered there.

4199
03:01:57,760 --> 03:01:58,200
I'm sorry.

4200
03:02:02,320 --> 03:02:03,440
I hope...

4201
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:05,240
I hope you guys...

4202
03:02:05,820 --> 03:02:06,860
No, please!

4203
03:02:07,820 --> 03:02:09,400
No, please, guys!

4204
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:13,340
Anyway, guys.

4205
03:02:15,100 --> 03:02:16,260
I had a great time.

4206
03:02:16,400 --> 03:02:17,660
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

4207
03:02:17,780 --> 03:02:18,680
Tomorrow we have two streams.

4208
03:02:18,860 --> 03:02:20,860
We have a Deadlock tournament stream.

4209
03:02:21,140 --> 03:02:23,420
Wait, I think... is Goombie messaging me about the team?

4210
03:02:24,840 --> 03:02:25,320
Okay.

4211
03:02:25,560 --> 03:02:25,900
Wait.

4212
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:27,020
Who...

4213
03:02:27,020 --> 03:02:28,280
Oh, shit!

4214
03:02:28,380 --> 03:02:29,460
Who are the...

4215
03:02:29,460 --> 03:02:30,580
Wait, what the fuck?

4216
03:02:30,840 --> 03:02:36,180
Who are the teammates so I can give this to Organizer?

4217
03:02:36,280 --> 03:02:37,600
I don't know if Goombie is still online.

4218
03:02:38,380 --> 03:02:41,300
Apparently, we have a full party with a few sweats.

4219
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:42,780
Wait, what?

4220
03:02:43,400 --> 03:02:44,700
Guys, I don't wanna...

4221
03:02:44,700 --> 03:02:48,700
Guys, we are not supposed to make it to day two, guys.

4222
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:50,600
We are not supposed...

4223
03:02:51,600 --> 03:02:54,540
This stream is Frieza Force approved.

4224
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:56,780
Thank you for the super chat.

4225
03:02:56,880 --> 03:02:57,480
Thank you.

4226
03:02:57,540 --> 03:02:58,280
Thank you.

4227
03:02:59,620 --> 03:03:03,440
This stream is sponsored by the Ginyu Force.

4228
03:03:04,780 --> 03:03:09,180
Okay, it is Seijam, Raditz, and Void.

4229
03:03:10,040 --> 03:03:11,780
Void, Rambling, and me.

4230
03:03:12,040 --> 03:03:14,580
Who... Okay, I don't know like half of these people.

4231
03:03:14,840 --> 03:03:15,280
Who?

4232
03:03:16,020 --> 03:03:16,980
Who are they?

4233
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:17,940
Okay, Void.

4234
03:03:18,400 --> 03:03:19,800
Someone's just named Void?

4235
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:21,400
Who's Void?

4236
03:03:21,920 --> 03:03:23,960
Is this GSM Void?

4237
03:03:24,160 --> 03:03:24,980
Who's this guy?

4238
03:03:26,480 --> 03:03:27,000
Alright.

4239
03:03:28,340 --> 03:03:29,780
He is a...

4240
03:03:29,780 --> 03:03:31,300
Are they all fighting gameplays?

4241
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:32,980
World's greatest gamer.

4242
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:33,540
Okay.

4243
03:03:34,580 --> 03:03:36,080
Oh, he plays...

4244
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:37,500
He plays Deadlock.

4245
03:03:37,540 --> 03:03:38,140
Oh, shit.

4246
03:03:38,240 --> 03:03:39,180
There are Deadlock players.

4247
03:03:39,540 --> 03:03:40,740
Okay, who's Rambling?

4248
03:03:42,780 --> 03:03:43,840
You got...

4249
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:45,120
No, Raditz.

4250
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:47,800
Oh my god, you got Raditz?

4251
03:03:50,900 --> 03:03:51,580
Who's...

4252
03:03:51,580 --> 03:03:52,360
Who's Raditz?

4253
03:03:52,520 --> 03:03:53,260
Who's Raditz?

4254
03:03:53,700 --> 03:03:54,760
Who's that guy?

4255
03:03:57,340 --> 03:03:58,020
Yeah.

4256
03:03:58,220 --> 03:03:59,500
Am I supposed to...

4257
03:03:59,500 --> 03:04:02,120
What the fuck is Raditz doing?

4258
03:04:02,500 --> 03:04:03,300
She got...

4259
03:04:04,220 --> 03:04:05,540
Oh my god.

4260
03:04:05,620 --> 03:04:06,940
I got...

4261
03:04:07,520 --> 03:04:09,580
I got Raditz.

4262
03:04:09,780 --> 03:04:10,260
Enjoy.

4263
03:04:11,280 --> 03:04:11,760
Alright.

4264
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:13,680
This guy is...

4265
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:15,480
I don't... Who's Raditz?

4266
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:16,160
Raditz.

4267
03:04:16,660 --> 03:04:17,720
Not Raditz.

4268
03:04:17,800 --> 03:04:19,300
I know who... Wait, does he play Deadlock?

4269
03:04:20,100 --> 03:04:20,880
Yeah, he does.

4270
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:22,600
Okay, I see him stream Deadlock.

4271
03:04:22,660 --> 03:04:23,960
Okay, and then we have Rambling.

4272
03:04:24,560 --> 03:04:25,660
Damn, that's insane.

4273
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:29,020
We're not supposed to go to Day 2, guys.

4274
03:04:29,480 --> 03:04:32,180
That's... We're not supposed to go to Day 2.

4275
03:04:32,800 --> 03:04:33,280
Okay.

4276
03:04:33,820 --> 03:04:36,200
And then we have Rambling.

4277
03:04:36,340 --> 03:04:37,340
Okay, that's our team.

4278
03:04:37,520 --> 03:04:39,100
And then we have Gumiya and Seijan.

4279
03:04:39,360 --> 03:04:39,840
Alright!

4280
03:04:40,160 --> 03:04:41,820
If we make it to Day 2...

4281
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:43,000
I...

4282
03:04:44,200 --> 03:04:44,760
Well...

4283
03:04:44,760 --> 03:04:46,700
It's just Karma at that point.

4284
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:47,480
It's just Karma.

4285
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:48,920
If we...

4286
03:04:48,920 --> 03:04:51,200
If we make it to Day 2...

4287
03:04:51,200 --> 03:04:53,080
It's just... It's just Karma.

4288
03:04:54,980 --> 03:04:56,100
It's like...

4289
03:04:56,100 --> 03:04:57,680
It's just Karma.

4290
03:04:59,680 --> 03:05:00,240
Anyway...

4291
03:05:01,440 --> 03:05:02,000
Anyway...

4292
03:05:02,580 --> 03:05:03,680
I'm gonna head off now.

4293
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:05,540
I'm gonna rest and relax now.

4294
03:05:05,600 --> 03:05:07,660
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

4295
03:05:08,040 --> 03:05:08,560
Posture check.

4296
03:05:08,620 --> 03:05:10,240
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4297
03:05:10,380 --> 03:05:12,000
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4298
03:05:12,180 --> 03:05:13,520
Because you deserve it.

4299
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:14,620
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4300
03:05:14,900 --> 03:05:15,340
Bye, guys.

4301
03:05:15,420 --> 03:05:15,640
Oh, yeah!

4302
03:05:15,700 --> 03:05:22,180
Tomorrow, the collab with Sykkuno, Elem, and Chilled is gonna be a rematch of Mario Party.

4303
03:05:22,980 --> 03:05:24,820
Elem's not gonna be hosting the server this time.

4304
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:27,580
It's a...

4305
03:05:27,580 --> 03:05:28,640
It's a rematch.

4306
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:30,220
Alright, I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4307
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:31,220
Bye, guys.

4308
03:05:31,420 --> 03:05:31,720
Bye!

4309
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:37,480
Monkey.
