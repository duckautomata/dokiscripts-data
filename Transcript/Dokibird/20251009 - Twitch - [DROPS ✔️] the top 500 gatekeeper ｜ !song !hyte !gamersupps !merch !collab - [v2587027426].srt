00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,720
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,380
I am back yet again.

3
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,060
Did you guys enjoy your, uh, your, what was it, 12 hour intermission for more rivals?

4
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,580
It's like you guys went to sleep, wake up, and wow, she's back.

5
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,300
I'm back.

6
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,500
I'm back with more rivals.

7
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,860
Yes, I know I said like, oh, maybe I'll do a stream on YouTube.

8
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,080
Like, do me a Zatsudan or Silk Song?

9
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,780
But you know what?

10
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,280
I decided to give in to my cravings because I was like, wait, it's the final count.

11
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,820
countdown.

12
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,300
There's almost 24 hours left of rank.

13
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,000
People are desperate now.

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,120
They want to get in.

15
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,520
And I, I will be the gatekeeper.

16
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,440
I, dawn of the final day, I will be the gatekeeper.

17
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,200
I am here to crush some dreams tonight.

18
00:02:48,460 --> 00:03:17,260
all these people with hope that maybe they can secure top 500 i will be the eo mm terrorist today i was terrorized for a week and now it's my turn i put on the mask it only takes one bad it was several bad days it actually several days.

19
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,900
And now I've become the thing I most hated.

20
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,080
An E-O-M-M demon.

21
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,920
The two McHugh final boss.

22
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,700
Fully the hopeful.

23
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,020
So they've become the hopeless.

24
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,620
They gotta stop hoping.

25
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,200
It's pathetic.

26
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,160
Hope.

27
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,060
Hope is a lie.

28
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,980
I'm here to teach them

29
00:03:49,280 --> 00:04:16,420
I mean it bring them to the real world Also for those who were watching For those who were watching last stream Or like you know the portion that where we got like this asshole on my team I reported him to the devs Okay it's so funny I sent them a message to my contacts Yeah,

30
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,300
of course, just shoot over the name.

31
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,180
An FBI will take action.

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
He was just like, don't worry.

33
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
The FBI is here.

34
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,420
He didn't get banned.

35
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,980
He got, like, muted.

36
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,620
I don't know for how long.

37
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,820
Because, you know, I don't...

38
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,280
I'm not sure if, though, he'll get banned.

39
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,080
Like, he'll get, like, suspended, like, a timeout for throwing the game.

40
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,500
Um, so I got the I got this message.

41
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,880
He has been muted.

42
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you for helping us maintain a positive community environment.

43
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,400
No, thank you, Marvel Rivals.

44
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,000
I the fuck boy investigator.

45
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,660
Yeah.

46
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,840
It's crazy.

47
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
Positive community environment.

48
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,880
And my stream title is top 500 gatekeeper.

49
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:28,960
guys see you guys i am maintaining a positive community environment for all

50
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:50,860
i'm such i'm a positive influence to the marvel rivals community yeah there can only be one elo terrorist and it's gonna be me i'm not throwing though i'm not I'm just very unlucky That's the thing I'm tech.

51
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,180
I'm not throw I haven't throw I make mistakes.

52
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,700
Yes, I make mistakes, but I'm not actually through I'm just very unlucky in my games

53
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,000
I just I just games just don't go for me.

54
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,700
Okay, I just get very unlucky RNG I never throw on purpose.

55
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
It's all an accident.

56
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:31,700
Also If I get any invitations from any new any players My only requirement is that you are trying to get top 500 You're close to top 500 or you're almost out You're you are top 500

57
00:06:35,760 --> 00:07:53,620
Those are and it has to be on account Can't be on an alt account That's like I don't know GM or some fucking shit your main or an alt account that is on the leaderboards or almost on the leaderboards or like you know like g or celestia because uh i i won't i'm here i'm here to free up some space on the leaderboards i'm i'm here i'm here to free up so to mad no no it's all about sending a message right now i'm here to clean up the leaderboards i and we're like okay this is like um old overwatch lore but for those who remember aimbot calvin he had like 10 accounts in top 500 and people were like stop hogging up all the spots in top 500 with your alt account and he was just like just get good and then i'm like don't worry i will fix the problem by getting all these alt accounts off of top i'm gonna fix the i'm gonna fix this problem by taking them all down and out of the leaderboard by making them play with me.

58
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm doing a service.

59
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,780
I'm a hero.

60
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,200
But yeah, it's because of what he said that Blizzard had to implement the phone number.

61
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:49,880
So that's why your account is now linked to your phone number to qualify for a top 500 leaderboard because he was like, like just get good then like people were complaining about why he had so many all accounts for top 500 and that he should free up some space for people who were trying to get it on their main accounts and he was like bro then just get better just get good like it's a skill issue right yeah and then he went and got all of his family members phone numbers implemented onto his accounts so he still continued to take up space on the leaderboard It's like,

62
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,600
well, you're going to add phone numbers?

63
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,540
I got 10 family members who I can borrow phone numbers from.

64
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,440
Yeah, that's why.

65
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,100
That's why your accounts are have to be linked to a number.

66
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,660
I hate to get it.

67
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,040
I hate to get him on the other team.

68
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,760
All that just to rage made people.

69
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,400
It fucking worked anyway.

70
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:19,760
Anyway, it's time.

71
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,840
I didn't warm up at all.

72
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,640
I took a little nap for those who were wondering.

73
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,900
I actually did take a tiny nap.

74
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,620
So I'm not going to be streaming 10 hours like last time, chat.

75
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,460
With the power.

76
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,960
Yeah, he is like advanced level gatekeeping.

77
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,800
With the power of family, I will become the gatekeeper.

78
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,500
I didn't warm up, so it's time.

79
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,280
I think this is the perfect time to queue more rain.

80
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
But yes, I did take a little nap.

81
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,120
And I woke up, walked, dad ate some food, and I was like, it's time.

82
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,840
It's time to put on the robe.

83
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:06,320
It's time to gatekeep, crush all these people who are trying to get top 500 on the final day.

84
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,880
No, I didn't sleep.

85
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,740
I didn't sleep.

86
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,200
I think I took like a three hour nap.

87
00:10:16,300 --> 00:11:35,060

chat gpt to generate my chat for me to be GPT.

89
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,220
I would be streaming Marvel Rivals.

90
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,560
What would my chat be like?

91
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,780
And this answer was also in the chat GPT prompt, like answer as well.

92
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,900
So yes, this is all AI generated.

93
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,180
What you see on the screen, with the power of AI, we can predict the future.

94
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,860
This is a pre-recorded chat.

95
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Beep, boop, pop.

96
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,940
Oh, damn.

97
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,620
No more AI slides.

98
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,620
Gordon, thank you for the thousand bitties.

99
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:13,980
Thank you.

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,580
Thank you.

101
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,080
Why the fuck are you live?

102
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,960
I did go to bed.

103
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,820
But I want to ruin some dreams today.

104
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,280
Okay, well, I did ruin some dreams last night.

105
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,260
But I want to keep going.

106
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,900
It gave me so much pleasure.

107
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:40,620
Out of... I was so sad until I realized, wait, I can make other people sad too.

108
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,120
And then that made me a little happier.

109
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,380
But it's okay.

110
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,640
Look what this letter said.

111
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,420
Thank you for helping us maintain a positive community environment.

112
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,500
Is that happiness from other people's misery?

113
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,480
You know what's up, Tempo.

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160

Thank you, thank you.

125
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,000
All right, I swear to God, if I see three supports, I swear to God.

126
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:54,560
I swear to fucking God, if I see three supports on my team, I will be so angry.

127
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,940
I will be...

128
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,540
All right.

129
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,760
Okay, it's not three supports.

130
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,180
Okay.

131
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't even know how I died there.

132
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,980
This sucks because I'm...

133
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,560
I don't hate doing duo support with Mantis.

134
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,300
It's...

135
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,920
Oh my god.

136
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,000
I hate it.

137
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,360
It's fine.

138
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,240
It's just not fun.

139
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,820
At least, like, they don't have any clothes for Angelus for now.

140
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,580
Alright, this is actually...

141
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,520
Okay, I'm gonna try to focus up a little bit because, like I said, I didn't warm up at all.

142
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,120
So it's not as...

143
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,220
as usual.

144
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,500
Where are you, Mantis?

145
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,340

149
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,100
It's fine.

150
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,660
Oh my god, the amplifier died so fast.

151
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,380
That's... Oh my god, okay.

152
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,480

153
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,360

There we go.

157
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,760
There we go.

158
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,060
We're losing.

159
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,660
Let's play triple support.

160
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,410
We're losing now.

161
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,040
There we go.

162
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,440
I mean, we have Mantis all.

163
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,220
Like, we're not...

164
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,000
Are we really not gonna use it?

165
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,380
I have to continue this melee because...

166
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,320
Oh, that's unlucky.

167
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:07,960
up i don't have oh oh i don't think he's gonna victory him honestly this sucks only because like

168
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:23,340
like i don't know what else they want me to do but i'm gonna save my punish all for my my elf yeah there's it's there's no reason to pop that we were down three anyway

169
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,640
Oh my god, why can't their team be stubborn like my team?

170
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,180
It's not fair.

171
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,560
I wish my team was as stubborn as their team, where they refuse to...

172
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,460
Oh my god.

173
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,340
There you go.

174
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,460
This is a lot of...

175
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:52,800
Woo!

176
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,340
Where am I?

177
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,900
There you go.

178
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,200
We used three of us for that, but that's fine.

179
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,500
We won the point.

180
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,680
The Elo should be gated.

181
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,520
Locked in.

182
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,340
All right, time to push.

183
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,540
Time to push this card because no one else wants to push it, which is fine.

184
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:25,700
Bye.

185
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,940
Oh, now.

186
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,860
Just keep pushing the card.

187
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,800
Time to keep pushing.

188
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,200
There you go.

189
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,160
Did my job.

190
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,160
Did my job.

191
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,100
Why would you not play Sue?

192
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,860
Like, I don't understand.

193
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,000
Like, why would you not play Sue?

194
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,580
Like, That is the...

195
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,860
You play it.

196
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:58,940
Cloak?

197
00:19:59,600 --> 00:19:59,940
Just...

198
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,440
That's the easiest count.

199
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,220
Okay, I shouldn't say that.

200
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,820
They're gonna swap this to the moment I say that.

201
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,240
They're gonna do it.

202
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,560
I know it.

203
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,640
I feel it in my bones.

204
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,040
I say it and they're gonna do it.

205
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,860
The reason why I have to melee is I don't melee, I'll be invisible.

206
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:25,100
And like, I don't want to waste my bullets shooting my gun to not be invisible.

207
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,480
Oh, here she is.

208
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,280
Where does she go?

209
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
There she go.

210
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,020
There she is.

211
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,540
Okay.

212
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,240
I'm worried I would waste ammo if I accidentally melee too much.

213
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,340
Holy shit!

214
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,740
That's a lot of damage!

215
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,040
Oh

216
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:08,760
Hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, um There's literally just one guy

217
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:27,260
One oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, that's so unlucky Wow, if only we killed the mag Was on the point If only...

218
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,940
If only we did the one thing.

219
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,280
Oh my god.

220
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,040
It's like...

221
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,140
If we did that, maybe we could have capped that point.

222
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,360
Is that crazy concept?

223
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,580
Honestly, a fucking...

224
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,560
A whole leash.

225
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,880
I don't know how you live that long, though.

226
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,440
Not gonna lie.

227
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,920
Please don't push him to me.

228
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:25,840
Target priority is crazy crazy concept I would love to heal I should went high ground with our Punisher because we don't really have front line oh well I want to heal my tank there you go hey hey guys there you go I just heal into that all right there you go there There we go.

229
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,920
And we just gotta destroy this.

230
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,560
We just gotta destroy this.

231
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,500
And we did it.

232
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,140
The current score is 3, 2, 0.

233
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,260
Camping point is illegal.

234
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,220
People just rather, people go for kills instead of going for objective.

235
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,540
I'm the type who fades quietly into the background.

236
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,000
The right heroes could make all the difference.

237
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,440
I think your entire team is so fun to shoot.

238
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,200
Not only here!

239
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,300
Oh geez.

240
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,840
That's crazy.

241
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,540
What BM?

242
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,500
No, the enemy team is a little dumb.

243
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,780
But maybe they'll surrender.

244
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,280
This is a good warm-up game though.

245
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,580
Because I'm definitely not warmed up.

246
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,380
I feel...

247
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:23,940
Oh.

248
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:40,700
I'm definitely not warmed up right now why win when you can over extend true just winners queue right now so it's a working wait I'll add I'm gonna add him

249
00:23:44,900 --> 00:24:06,140
winners queue you say and then if he accepts and then we lose our first game I'll Be like welcome to losers cute and then and then leave the duo and then I doki can fix that Is that fucked up?

250
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,560
Is that fucked up?

251
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,840
Guess how that fucked up, right?

252
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:25,840
It can't be that much It's not that bad of me to do Oh nice and then I just oh goodbye I leave No.

253
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,720
I leave.

254
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,220
Just drop.

255
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:34,620
Just drop.

256
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,700
Okay.

257
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,000
It's all so fucked up.

258
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,080
Okay, but is it, though?

259
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,900
That's subjective.

260
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,360
How fucked up is it, though?

261
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,300
Like, is this...

262
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:12,140
just like you know it's just a little tiki fun times just some little fun times you know just just be a little pesky rascal yeah boys will be boys

Oh, wait, this guy.

267
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,470
I was flanking and shooting your rocket literally all day.

268
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,570
All right.

269
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,210
That's crazy.

270
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:08,990
All right.

271
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,110
Yo, RXX.

272
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,170
Punisher 1V1.

273
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,390

Alright, let's go.

279
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,090
And again.

280
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,190
We go again.

281
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,410
Yeah, at least he won his scrims or tournament games.

282
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,610
He is in Winner's queue.

283
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,570
Two games.

284
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,090
Two people are winning two in a row.

285
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,930
is honestly very inspirational.

286
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,570
Bro, remember that guy?

287
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,030
This guy that added me yesterday?

288
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,170
Bro, look at this.

289
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:26,810
Look at this.

290
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,890
This is a golden...

291
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,310
This is like...

292
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,830
This makes me angry.

293
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,590
I should have dragged him down when I had the chance.

294
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,710
I...

295
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,050
When did I show up?

296
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,910
When did I show up?

297
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,390
I knew I showed up somewhere.

298
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,190
I should have added this man when I had the chance to bring him down.

299
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,070
I'm angry.

300
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,470
I could have stopped this.

301
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,950
So happy for you.

302
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:07,090
I could have stopped this when I had the chance.

303
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,510
I should have asked him for a duel.

304
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,810
So, so happy for him.

305
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,290
I don't even know when I should have.

306
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:17,890
showed up.

307
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:18,990
Because I added this guy.

308
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,170
He added me yesterday.

309
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,150
Wait, does he, yeah, he secures it too.

310
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,470
That's the worst part.

311
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,690
That's the worst part.

312
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,970
Leave Apollo alone.

313
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,350
Was it the fourth game?

314
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,470
One, two, three, four?

315
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,950
No, it wasn't.

316
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,570
Oh, one, two, three, four here.

317
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,810
Oh my God, when he fired me, he fucking added me here.

318
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,670
Do you think?

319
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:42,810
Do you think?

320
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,690
Yeah, when he fired me, he added me.

321
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,490
How dare he?

322
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,250
Makes me angry.

323
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,750
And this is why I'm online right now.

324
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,010
This is why I'm streaming right now to prevent this from happening again.

325
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,750
Rank 68?

326
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,610
Hmm.

327
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,690
Which hero do you think you have me today?

328
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,250
We can fix that.

329
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,340
Oh yeah, that guy's a...

330
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,460
That guy's was a Hulk one trick, wasn't he?

331
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,260
Um, Hulk one trick on enemy team.

332
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,860
Should we ban Hulk?

333
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,020
Y'all boy is a pretty decent Hulk player.

334
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,680
Should we ban...

335
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,400
Hulk in case of team up.

336
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,200
Yeah, we can ban Hulk too.

337
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,280
Hulk or Jeff, IMO.

338
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,080
Not Mag, I can play Mag.

339
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,420
Alright, we'll do Jeff.

340
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,880
I'll do Jeff.

341
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,290
It's your boy.

342
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,550
Yeah.

343
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:41,350
I just remember him playing Hulk because we were like, can you swap off Hulk and then No reply That's all I remember because everyone was like get off Hulk get off and just Zero response.

344
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,930
Yes man just has this man just has his air pods on.

345
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,050
No, he doesn't even say no He didn't even say no.

346
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,330
He just was just fucking playing Hulk with his air pods on.

347
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,490
He didn't fucking care

348
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:30,550
Oh, if he's playing I don't have to play Luna for the team up because team up is actually pretty decent type who fades quite oh never mind i'm not the type i'm luna snow like the moon fucky phoenix no more pun um you can talk about you should be fine all right you can play the punisher is that what you're telling me to see something here we go where oh i could play rocket number five go away number two what do you want to play oh no i i play pun i'm the punisher Wait,

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,150
Oh, I am the Punisher.

351
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,370
Okay.

352
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,590
I thought you were like...

353
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,190
I like Ultra.

354
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,710
I want him to play Punisher in practice range in 1v1.

355
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,850
I want to play Punisher.

356
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,170
Wait, oh my God.

357
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,990
Is this the rifle guy again?

358
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,030
Oh my God.

359
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,150
It's him again.

360
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,630
He's like, I want it to 1v1.

361
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,710
Oh my God.

362
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,470
I have to play.

363
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,250
I have to play.

364
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,450
I have to play too.

365
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,530
And I have the best aim in Marble Rivals.

366
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,210
That's unlucky.

367
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,810
Like that guy?

368
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,590
I know the Mantis proved that.

369
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,790
Mantis, I know you heard all those headshots, right?

370
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,390
Jesus.

371
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,710
Club is one, club is one.

372
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,150
In the back.

373
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,930
Luna one as well.

374
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,070
Luna one, Luna one.

375
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,470
Both heroes are one.

376
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,710
I'm flaking them.

377
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,510
Oh my god.

378
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,230
Luna one.

379
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,550
That Namor is half up there, by the way.

380
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:29,870
Hey, guys.

381
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:30,830
Anyone

382
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:53,970
All right, all right, this is not great for me All right It's time for me to play It's time to play this guy I don't know I did too.

383
00:34:54,110 --> 00:35:04,010
I knew I knew we should have been I knew we should have been fucking Bruce All right, I didn't even get healed

384
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:18,690
All right, here we go All right, here we go I'm doing this my way What the fuck?

385
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:19,970
Where is he?

386
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:31,570
I got you a shield Bro, our mantis left me Two of my supports left me Bro What?

387
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,710
I don't give up so easily.

388
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,750
They both let me get you!

389
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,470
I thought I should have done that a little earlier.

390
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,250
That's actually...

391
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,750
That's crazy.

392
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,670
Both my supports left me there.

393
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,430
Like, I don't...

394
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,690
Did you guys see that?

395
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,150
That's...

396
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,410
That makes me so sad.

397
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,250
I'm losing now because I didn't get all two.

398
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,230

00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,030
Oh my god, stop!

403
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,030
It's actually so good.

404
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,890
We're still on point here.

405
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,830
Oh my god.

406
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,310
Okay, thank god we didn't do a Q.

407
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,930
Thank god, we didn't do a Q, we didn't add him.

408
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,190
This guy is actually so fucking cringe.

409
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,230
So fucking cringe.

410
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,350
He's like, bro, this is so cringe, bro.

411
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,290
It's just like, bro, so fucking cringe.

412
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,230
This Q is, the Doom Q give-up and the Doom Q take it.

413
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,870
There you go.

414
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,250
You're fucking welcome.

415
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,810
My support isn't feeling.

416
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:29,150
She's just damage boosting, which is very unfortunate.

417
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:49,290
magic behind she's looking there you go this is the only thing i can do oh my god why are you so far why are you so far oh my god

418
00:37:53,470 --> 00:38:03,750
oh thank god thank god they swapped thank god I don't think maybe we might actually have time yet.

419
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,090
I can jump through.

420
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:06,890
I don't think so.

421
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,380
Don't get up for it.

422
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm gonna take care of it some more.

423
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,320
Okay.

424
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,580
Jesus Christ, it was blocking me.

425
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,580
Oh my god!

426
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,460
Are you...

427
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,040
I hate this one-hit combo.

428
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,760
I was trying to leave because I knew she had...

429
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,100
Okay.

430
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,100
Oh yeah, first time ever on stream.

431
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,600
She, the, the thing, the...

432
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,760
Magic can do a one-hit combo, so I was trying to leave as much as I can.

433
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,220
I was literally trying to get my, get the shit out of here.

434
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,200
But I couldn't, sadly.

435
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,820
I don't know how to use the primary on the Shiro.

436
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,240
I sadly could not leave.

437
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,640
It did not let me leave.

438
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,400
And it made me very, very sad.

439
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,430
All right.

440
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,560
I'm trying my best to heal.

441
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,740
Hey guys, we're gonna be funny if we banned Bruce back.

442
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,780
Oh my god, wow.

443
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
If only we banned the team up.

444
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,180
Oh man.

445
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,660
I sure wish we banned the fucking team up.

446
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,480
And just set him jack.

447
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,040
I knew it.

448
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,580
I knew it.

449
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,220
I was like, most likely they're gonna play it.

450
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,400
Even more.

451
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,080
Trip support.

452
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,540
Boom, boom, boom.

453
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,300
Win.

454
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,840
I feel like if he goes Ultron and I'm on Thor, you're on...

455
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,100
It feels good to step outside.

456
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,780
They want him to have bad.

457
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:58,800
Yeah.

458
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,080
Also mixed in.

459
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,260
Yeah, this works too.

460
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,740
Oh, I can't play Luna.

461
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,040
They have a fucking Angela.

462
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,540
Oh, the fuck.

463
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,520
You have a Lord Ultron?

464
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,380
30 seconds.

465
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,420
Just keep Punisher drone.

466
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,080
Get ready.

467
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,880
That was a Doom Q.

468
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,660
It's going great.

469
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,840
It's going great, guys.

470
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,700
It's going great.

471
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,980
It's actually going amazing.

472
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,560
My support left me to die, like, three times in a row.

473
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,600
It was great.

474
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,340
I literally watched my mantis walk away from me, like, three times.

475
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,900
So much fun.

476
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,940
So much fun.

477
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,040
I did let her die one time, but that was to teach her a lesson.

478
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,220
And be like, it's not so fun, is it?

479
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,060
Being left alone.

480
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,560
It's not that fun, right?

481
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,080
Yeah.

482
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,400
You have as you have even less mobility than me.

483
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,460
Angela coming behind us right here.

484
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,640
Focus Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela.

485
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,400
She is not one.

486
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,860
That was a fucking lie.

487
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,420
Now she's one.

488
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,260
All right.

489
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,020
All right, drop down.

490
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,260
Just don't drop though.

491
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:11,920
Don't drop yet.

492
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,480
Oh.

493
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,640
Stay up.

494
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,000
Stay up.

495
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,520
The whole team needs to stay up here and save lives.

496
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:49,400
I thought I could stall Goodbye, this is where I leave This is where I leave Oh my god, I couldn't fucking push her because a group wall fucking mispositioned me Come Please where are we going?

Jesus Christ.

500
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,520
This is not a team.

501
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,680
This is not a team.

502
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,060
This is six people that found themselves in quick play.

503
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,620
Six people in quick play.

504
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,300
This is absolutely not a team.

505
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,220
I do not believe.

506
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:54,890
Hello.

507
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,450
Oh my god.

508
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:57,590
Oh my god.

509
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,830

510
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,790
I'm bold.

511
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,550
I'm gonna push her out.

512
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,050
Oh my god.

513
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,630
Oh my god.

514
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,610
Oh my god.

515
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,770
What the fuck?

516
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,250
Can we find up here?

517
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,970
I have a little corner.

518
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,990
Jesus Christ.

519
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,830
So much damage.

520
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,610
Oh the fuck did he die?

521
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,050
I need it.

522
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,350
I don't want to push now.

523
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,150
I had to push.

524
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,170
I'm dead.

525
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,270
I am so dead.

526
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,470
I am so dead.

527
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,130

528
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,600
Bro, I got you!

529
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,620
I was trying to stall as much as Akko.

530
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,680
I'm going to kill everyone on the wall.

531
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:15,800
That's fine.

532
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:16,860
He got XL.

533
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,780
That was such a good XL too.

534
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,640
All right, here we go.

535
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,820
They don't need me.

536
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,200
Okay, they might need me.

537
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,740
We should just walk in with Mantis.

538
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,940
Go, go.

539
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,980
Why did you go so?

540
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,620
Okay, it's fine.

541
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,080
It's fine.

542
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:34,760

547
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,260
I'm low, I'm low, I'm low.

548
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,520

Actually, where the fuck are we?

554
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,280
We are not a team.

555
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh.

556
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,180

This is one round, one round, but one ring below top 500.

568
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,700
That's the crazy part.

569
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,200
This is one ring below top 500.

570
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,780
Steve, welcome to Celestia lobbies.

This map's a lot better for me, so should be chilling.

572
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,540
Everyone's in the same state of mind.

573
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,720
I'm supposed to be the Elo Terrorist, not them.

574
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,400
Oh my god, I forgot to split this up.

575
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,700
Now I'm the Elo Terrorist.

576
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,190
I forgot to put my shields up.

577
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,060
The most important part.

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,580
I'm staying as Rocket, so because I have all of them anyway.

579
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,220
And they don't have...

580

They don't really have anything for it.

581
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,580
They don't have Phoenix, so...

582
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,300

His ego is astronomical.

Sub to your barber on YouTube for insane punishing gameplay.

656
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,120
He is his own number one fan.

657

How do I rewind?

676
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,040
My God, I'm so stupid with this.

677
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:46,520

All right.

683
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,740
Now, I was like, what happened to my fucking crosshair?

684
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,300
There it is.

685
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,000
Jesus.

686
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,520
I was like, bro, what the fuck happened to it?

687
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,720
All right.

688
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,160
Here it is.

689
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,860
A moment of truth.

690
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,280
Recap.

691
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,080
Here it is.

692
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,020
We get the POV right here.

693
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,680
Where am I?

694
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:27,680
Oh, I'm just here.

695
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,340
There I go.

696
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,820
Setting up.

697
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,580
Here I am.

698
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,720
Here I am.

699
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,140
Just chilling.

700
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,380
They don't know.

701
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,700
Gamers just don't look up.

702
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,560
There I go.

703
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,100

00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:35,900
I'm over here.

711
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,900
I'm already not thinking where the heals coming from.

712
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,740
Where the fuck are the rocket bullets coming from?

713
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,840
He's like, where is he?

714
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,600
Wait, where is he?

715
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:53,140
I think he flew up because he knew I was there, but he was like, where's he going?

716
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,280
Where did he go?

717
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,260
Like, yeah.

718
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:01,260
Because I was in, like, I was in, like, the corridor.

719
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,540
He saw the orbs and he was so confused.

720
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,860
He knew what he didn't knew at the same time.

721
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:11,640
All right.

722
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,400
And then, oh, he said it!

723
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,140
See me!

724
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:14,980
He saw!

725
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,880
Wait, what's my tail peeking through?

726
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,940
That was crazy.

727
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,920
I boozled the guy by standing still in the corner.

728
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,280
Did you see his movements?

729
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,940
Holy shit, a rat.

730
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,980
Where does this rat come from?

731
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,120
Okay, where's the tail?

732
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,740
Oh shit, where's the tail?

733
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,520
I need to know.

734
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,780
Apparently my tail was peeking through.

735
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,620
He's probably watching the replay too.

736
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,420
He's like, where was the raccoon?

737
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:54,600

738
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,680
He's scared.

739
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,160
He's fucking scared.

740
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,000
He doesn't know.

741
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,870
He doesn't know if he's secure or not.

742
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,210
He's checking every hour.

743
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,330
By the hour.

744
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:17,410
Celestial one?

745
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,170
I think it'll be high Celestial two.

746
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,410
I think it'll just be like just high Celestial two.

747
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,230
I'm pretty sure.

748
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,170
I could be wrong.

749
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:28,590
I could be wrong.

750
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,990
Because last season was...

751
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,330
Last time it was Celestia 1.

752
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,220
Alright.

753
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,020
Let's go into Doom matches.

754
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,720
Standing still.

755
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,400
No one's...

756
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,820
See, I learned, guys.

757
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,500
I learned from...

758
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,000
I learned from...

759
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,060
Oh my god.

760
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,860
These are actual killers in my lobby.

761
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,420
I learned from Apex.

762
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,800
My ability to rat.

763
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:00,840
the raccoon.

764
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,720
That's where the rat comes from.

765
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:06,760
Oh, wait.

766
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,300
No, they're not.

767
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:07,780
Hello.

768
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:09,380
Whoa!

769
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,860
Oh, she's just sitting with him.

770
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,880
Okay, she's just sitting with him.

771
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,080
Okay, that's...

772
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,740
Oh, that's cute.

773
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,640
Look, they're e-dating.

774
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,040
Oh.

775
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,700
Look, they're e-dating.

776
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,640
Hello, ma'am.

777
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,000
We are undating.

778
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,400
No one's judging.

779
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,600
This is a judge-free snow.

780
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,080
Guys, sniff us.

781
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,500
Don't mess with the amazing Spider-Man!

782
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,020
I'm just sniffing.

783
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:51,740
Wait, what else?

784
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:52,640
Oh, and you have this.

785
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,020
The cup of...

786
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,060
Yeah, I'm the dog.

787
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,560
Wolf, wolf.

788
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,180
Hello.

789
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,880
Tease good girl.

790
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:02,240
Wait.

791
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,040
T's a good girl.

792
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,720
Oh my gosh, who's T?

793
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,080
That's not T.

794
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,660
That's caught.

795
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,860
Wait a minute.

796
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,200
This guy's name's not T.

797
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:21,460
Drama.

798
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,880
She's cheating.

799
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,500
Oh my god.

800
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,620
Poor T.

801
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,360
She ain't...

802
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:29,460
No.

803
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,720
Guys, I don't think she's a good girl.

804
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:33,340
Oh!

805
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,800
Oh, I'm sorry!

806
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:35,340
Oh!

807
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:36,740
I won't go!

808
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:37,940
I won't stitch!

809
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,020
I won't stitch!

810
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,660
I'm the candid camera girl.

811
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:47,460
She kicked the dot.

812
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:52,060
She knew I wanted to expose her.

813
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,080
And she taught me a lesson.

814
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,040
No witnesses.

815
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,800
Oh, sorry.

816
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,200
Sorry.

817
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,500
I was just spitting.

818
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,520
Latino bean boy.

819
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:06,600
Oh, God, T.

820
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,440
How many other girls does she...

821
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,920
How many other guys is she talking to?

822
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,340
Bro!

823
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,880
She belongs in the street!

824
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:28,970
The final thing I do before I kill.

825
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:35,150
The last thing I do before I leave is a little...

826
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,070
Not one last chance for the ride.

827
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:38,850
What, Chiro, do you think you want to be today?

828
01:03:41,930 --> 01:04:13,830

832
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,660
What?

833
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,580
Pick your hero.

834
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:54,620
What?

835
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,460
This is a pre-lord shit that I was not aware of.

836
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:04,770
What is this pre-lord shit?

837
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,970
Fine.

838
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:09,190
Fine!

839
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:10,650
Stupid cloak player.

840
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:13,310
Do we want a triple or do we want two tanks?

841
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:15,690
God damn fucking yeah.

842
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:16,350
Fucking yeah.

843
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:17,910
Cloket player.

844
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:18,890
Cham, sham, get on hella.

845
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:20,110
Get on hella.

846
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,110
I'm sad.

847
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:27,690
I'm sad.

848
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:29,190
I'm sad.

849
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:29,590
I'm sad.

850
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:31,170
I'm sad.

851
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,570
I just wanted to play Invis.

852
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,050
That's all I wanted to do.

853
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,170
30 seconds before you attack.

854
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,530
Back to Luna Gel, I go.

855
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,150
I mean, if he plays Ultron, then I'll say Luna.

856
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:43,890
Okay, he's not.

857
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:44,190
Okay.

858
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:47,150
I ain't playing Luna.

859
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:49,010
I don't think I need to play.

860
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,310
We have double tanks.

861
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,970
I can build all super fast with these two.

862
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:54,910
Yay.

863
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,450
No Luna Gel.

864
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,530
No Luna Gel.

865
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:58,470
Let's go.

866
01:05:59,170 --> 01:05:59,650
Yiffy.

867
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:01,230
Yiffy.

868
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:02,590
Happiness, joy.

869
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:04,210
For a little longer.

870
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:12,570
all right off we go

871
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:30,450
i've been winning too much it's time for the eom agents to click in i don't like it it feels sus doesn't feel right

872
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,410
has to be the thing is there has to be a catch

873
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:52,480
oh my god there's always a catch

874
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:14,730
oh my god the focus everybody's taking so much damage jesus christ everyone's taking too much damage i don't like it I have a Holy shit, I built all so fast

876
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:53,030
Oh nice, okay, still nice

877
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:57,950
What's going on?

878
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:01,310
What are these fights?

879
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:13,170
Holy shit, bro, okay, these guys try Why do these guys try even harder on the last day versus yesterday?

880
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:16,690
I think it's just the last 24 hours.

881
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:19,950
More of a risk factor.

882
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:23,810
I'm getting some pretty fucking crazy games right now.

883
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,930
I am not ready for this.

884
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,170
I thought I was gonna get some more clowns.

885
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:33,330
Oh, actually no, I did get clowns yesterday, like last game.

886
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,490
But you know what I mean.

887
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,190
You know what I mean.

888
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:38,910
These guys are like...

889
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:42,130
They might be clowns, but they're also like...

890
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:58,370
I got... I was just like ring around the rosy.

891
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,970
Holy shit.

892
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:00,930
Okay, we got 99.

893
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:01,930
We got 99.

894
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:03,310
I don't know where I was.

895
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:05,350
I felt like I was so lost.

896
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,390
Life was a highway.

897
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:16,950
Life was truly... It feels like the games are more intense, but also they are very unorganized.

898
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,990
That's how it feels like now that I think about it.

899
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:23,990
Like everybody is not... I feel like I'm playing Quitsay, but with more risk.

900
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:55,650
involved like this is gamer quick play oh my god i didn't think i didn't think he would walk up um i should have ulted i didn't want to oh because it felt like a useless uh like this does not feel like a team game right now it really does not what Bro,

901
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:56,670
are we going in with...

902
01:09:56,670 --> 01:10:00,150
Okay, guys, we're just getting picked one by one, guys.

903
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:01,130
Hello?

904
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:05,170
Can we not get picked one by one?

905
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:06,170
Can I walk with Emma here?

906
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:13,490
Oh, my God.

907
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:19,110
Okay, that's good.

908
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,430
Oh, my God.

909
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:25,190
I literally needed a little bit of heals.

910
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:27,030
That's so unlucky.

911
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:28,850
One point.

912
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:30,750
That's so unlucky.

913
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:31,390
I got...

914
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:32,530
I don't give up so easily.

915
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:35,310
I got knocked out of my ult by the Thor.

916
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,630
Oh, no.

917
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:40,590
Oh, no.

918
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:41,350
Oh, teleport.

919
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:43,450
Might not have time, though.

920
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:44,770
We just kept feeding.

921
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,450
That's unlucky.

922
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:48,910
All of us just kept feeding non-stop.

923
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:49,630
I'm still reporting.

924
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:51,390
I'm opening a portal.

925
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:52,850
I'm coming over.

926
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:54,590
Oh, my God.

927
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:55,710
I wish we weren't feeding, though.

928
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:15,670
oh my god oh my god

929
01:11:19,300 --> 01:12:11,460
why did we get picked three times in a row I had to say something I just did I had to say something went downhill you can count on me i gotta play no starlord a course i had to say something and then everything just went downhill it's always like that i was i was like this feels too easy and then the game was like bet oh wow you saw enough of a challenge all right like oh my martine fucking went and died like three times in a row each person got picked one by one that's so unlucky we could have easily we could have easily uh had three fights there

930
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:28,660
which sucked like we were doing so well and then they all were like but what if i just walk up by myself team this is what i'm saying it feels like i'm just playing quick play with six people or five people.

931
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,240
It doesn't feel like I'm playing a real fucking match.

932
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,440
Like, this game

933
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:44,870
and...

934
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:45,430
Okay.

935
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:48,030
I got both before this.

936
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:50,290
Yeah, they're dying on top.

937
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:52,670
Alright, that's fine.

938
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:54,870
That's fine.

939
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:59,390
Like, we win through aim, but we don't win the alt battle.

940
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,090
That's the issue.

941
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:06,050
Like, when they have better alt rotation, we just don't win.

942
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:10,490
If alts didn't exist in this game, we win.

943
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:15,330
I want a hero shooter where we don't have alts.

944
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:18,030
It's just pure aim and abilities.

945
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:25,630
Where are those games?

946
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:28,550
No util.

947
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:33,030
Is he at?

948
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:33,790
No util!

949
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:39,610
I can all first.

950
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:40,910
We love Thud.

951
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:42,250
No, man, he's dead.

952
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:46,270
Alright, I said I can all first.

953
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,010
So if they don't listen, that's on them.

954
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:51,370
Look at that.

955
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:52,750
I'm so nice in game.

956
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:54,830
As long as you don't open my bye.

957
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:57,250
Wow, I was like trash talking my team.

958
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,210
As long as they...

959
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:07,170
He's like, wow, she sounds so nice.

960
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:08,430
I have my positive.

961
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,550
Oh, never mind.

962
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:14,070
Okay.

963
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:17,690
Good luck.

964
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:21,710
That was not a damage boost.

965
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:31,100
Oh my gosh, she's so...

966
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,220
She's so alive.

967
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:33,820
But not me, though.

968
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,380
Not me.

969
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:42,440
She was so alive until she wasn't.

970
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,280
I should not have fucking...

971
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,000
Oh my god, why did she ult that?

972
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,400
She was so scared.

973
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:56,940
That's unlucky.

974
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,100
If she didn't ult that, we would have had...

975
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,200
I need to heal.

976
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,500
That was such a weird ult.

977
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,760
That was a very unnecessary ult too.

978
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:09,580
Oh my god, yeah.

979
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:10,960
I'm a little scared.

980
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,680
Well, at least...

981
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,620
At least the Hella did something.

982
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:31,700
Aw, but the Hella died.

983
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:34,460
What?

984
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,620
Let's just...

985
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:40,920
Just give.

986
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,400
Please, let's not get picked, guys.

987
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:50,160
That's how we lost last time, guys.

988
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:59,760
That's how guys that's how we lost last time That's that's That's the fourth man

989
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:38,510
Okay Luna you can all first I am ready to put on a show Rehoves the god of thunder All right Oh please no he didn't he didn't block me why

that's crazy

993
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,100
avoid for Jay's life.

994
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,170
Oh my God.

995
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,450
I should have just alted first.

996
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,130
I should have just alted first.

997
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:40,730
And they're going to do that combo.

998
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:45,990
I didn't want to alt first because last time I was like, oh, I'll alt first.

999
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,550
And then my Luna alted.

1000
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:48,190
And I was like, Luna?

1001
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,090
Okay, I'll let you alt.

1002
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:51,750
I'll let you alt.

1003
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:54,450
You know what?

1004
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:56,430
I'm just going to avoid the Luna.

1005
01:17:56,470 --> 01:18:56,910
them too i don't think they're a support player oh yeah no they are 100 not a support player yeah i had a feeling i had it all right oh you got this what a surprise i oh maybe i should i i think if i ulted first they wouldn't have the combo but then that would mean i have to be like away from the combo i have to be like make sure away from the combo and also my team would have died to the combo too so like my team couldn't play in the alt because of the combo only the tanks i think only the tanks can survive it i'm pretty sure yeah my team at zero team up i told you if my team what if my team play by pure just skill and aim we win but Our team,

1006
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:59,110
my team was so bad with alts.

1007
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:03,130
They were so, they were fucking so bad with alt rotation.

1008
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:07,710
Like, like, I can't fix that.

1009
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,830
We had no team in my team play.

1010
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:15,870
Team used loosely.

1011
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:20,470
I swear to God, I am not.

1012
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:26,450
They actually win because of the fact that their team actually worked together.

1013
01:19:26,470 --> 01:20:25,730
their team is hard my last two games felt like i was playing quickly for real i don't know what emotes oh wait i have this one oh it is oh my god how long has dog boys been in this lobby this guy has definitely been here for do people just hang out and do match just for fun is that a thing that people do sorry for your loss lost my mom chat jesus christ is this free therapy what is going on hey guys did i hear someone's wedding night my top 500 friends i didn't care holy shit hey buddy i care oh my from getting trauma dumped

1014
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:35,650
that's because they're top 500 oh

1015
01:20:39,810 --> 01:21:31,630
shit yeah i'm just a girl yeah also because they have no souls that's my final thing to say to them before uh i go get in the match oh my god i'm the only celestian match is over and i'm the only celestial player it's like over my parting words yeah before i leave they have no soul i'm not the type who fades quietly into the background yeah but if they're a top if there are celestial um dps or tank player it's over for me what all what can i do i just go until they're,

1016
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:35,330
until they're like, you know, they're dead, I guess.

1017
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:37,890
I can only heal so much, chat.

1018
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:42,070
I can only do so much.

1019
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:46,090
The game giveth and the game taketh away from me.

1020
01:21:58,410 --> 01:21:59,110
I'm batting torch.

1021
01:21:59,250 --> 01:21:59,770
I don't care.

1022
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:03,330
I refuse to have any torch players in my game.

1023
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,170
I don't care about the double bat.

1024
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:13,550
Bum, bum, put it on them.

1025
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,030
Oh,

1026
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:19,530
we have no front line.

1027
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:22,230
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

1028

01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:55,230

01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:16,010
What is going on?

1086
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:17,290
What is going on?

1087
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:18,450
in my team.

1088
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:22,650
Guys, what is going on here?

1089
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:23,910
We need to have a talk!

1090
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,130
I don't know how I'm alive.

1091
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:26,610
I was barely alive.

1092
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,710
The Starlight was actually waiting for us.

1093
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:33,130
Like, the thing is, we have no defensive ult.

1094
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:35,590
I mean, we don't have enough, actually, we have...

1095
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:38,050
We don't have enough defensive ult, which is...

1096
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:39,790
Oh my god, he was right here.

1097
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:42,670
They're like an extended.

1098
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:44,390
I'm just gonna switch up a little bit.

1099
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:46,410
He's still up top.

1100
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:50,930
That's the worst part.

1101
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,570
Jesus, we're literally...

1102
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:54,490
Oh, I got my best.

1103
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:55,130
Please!

1104
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:58,010
Whoa, we're getting staggered, everyone!

1105
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:00,930
It's one guy!

1106
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:03,230
Bro, why are you getting staggered?

1107
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,610

1108
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:05,130
Give me a second.

1109
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:05,870
I'll be there.

1110
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:08,070
All right.

1111
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:09,250
Out of mirror.

1112
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,010
Oh my god, I didn't put this on him.

1113
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:16,730
Oh my, oh my god.

1114
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:19,690
That was actually clutch right there

1115
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:31,690
Oh, this sucks.

1116
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:37,090
We just don't have enough support ult Literally, I can't do anything

1117
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:45,070
We just need we literally just need like another support

1120
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:26,670
It's not fine.

1121
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:32,810
Can we have another defensive up?

1122
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:34,350
I'm Luna Snow.

1123
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:35,730
Like the moon.

1124
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:38,730
Or triple.

1125
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:41,430
Alright, here we go.

1126
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:43,490
There we go.

1127
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:46,730
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

1128
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:49,890
Here we go.

1129
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:53,830
This is fine now.

1130
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:57,890
What the...

1131
01:30:57,890 --> 01:30:58,830
Okay, this is...

1132
01:30:58,830 --> 01:30:59,570
Oh, okay.

1133
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:03,450
We'll do this.

1134
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:05,770
We'll do this.

1135
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,930
Mantis, Cloak, and...

1136
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,450
And Jeff.

1137
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:12,630
Oh, my God.

1138
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:16,670
No, I'm asking for the Jeff to swap off Jeff.

1139
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:18,010
Because, like...

1140
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:19,390
They have Star World.

1141
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,650
They have...

1142
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:20,890
Hello.

1143
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:55,670

1144
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:57,150
In my full build, let's see.

1145
01:31:58,350 --> 01:31:59,250
Yeah, yeah.

1146
01:31:59,690 --> 01:31:59,990
Dragon.

1147
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:04,750
Oh my god, that wall was very tired.

1148
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:07,830
Come back, buddy.

1149
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:10,970
Come back.

1150
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:11,550
Wait.

1151
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:15,170
We are not really...

1152
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:16,630
Okay, I have to swap.

1153
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:18,210
Okay.

1154
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:22,630
I should have to swap.

1155
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:25,070
We're not getting enough healings.

1156
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:28,330
I'll probably just like front lane more since we're at least taking like damage.

1157
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:28,570
Walking?

1158
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:28,990
Walking?

1159
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:30,070
Yep.

1160
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:31,050
Wait, wait.

1161
01:32:32,530 --> 01:32:32,950
Alright.

1162
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:34,950
I'm trying to like...

1163
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:35,830
Bro, what?

1164
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:37,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1165
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:41,010
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

1166
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:41,670
Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma.

1167
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:44,970
Alright.

1168
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:50,330
Oh my god, what?

1169
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:53,910
Please, I'm so close.

1170
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:57,850
Okay, we'll do that first.

1171
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:01,350
Follow, follow, follow.

1172
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:02,050
Damage.

1173
01:33:02,190 --> 01:33:03,410
There you go.

1174
01:33:06,570 --> 01:33:08,130
I am not dying to him.

1175
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:08,970
I am.

1176
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:09,990
I don't care.

1177
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:14,270
I don't fucking care.

1178
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:15,030
We have crew.

1179
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:18,790
You sorry, y'all have hello old.

1180
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:19,950
You get a good eye.

1181
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:20,370
It's fine.

1182
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:22,330
We have another defensive!

1183
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:27,710
I felt like he would have killed me though.

1184
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:30,650
I definitely would have been so dead.

1185
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:36,530
I know for a fact that I would have died.

1186
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,350
Oh my god.

1187
01:33:42,110 --> 01:33:43,770
Yep, back on.

1188
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:46,550
Oh my god.

1189
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:47,750
Oh my god, please.

1190
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:49,490
Please use all.

1191
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:50,490
Oh my god.

1192
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:56,750
Can you use this so far?

1193
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:57,870
I was gonna be a slightly bit longer.

1194
01:33:57,990 --> 01:33:58,710
I was gonna be slightly bit longer.

1195
01:33:58,970 --> 01:33:59,330
I'm on my nivies.

1196
01:33:59,430 --> 01:33:59,690
I'm on my nivies.

1197
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:02,470
I'm trying to farm as much as I can.

1198
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:02,950
You got a skirmish?

1199
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:04,130
Okay, this is bad.

1200
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:04,710
Okay, I got it.

1201
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:05,450
Cite out, Cite out, Cite out.

1202
01:34:05,790 --> 01:34:06,450
Huge eye, he's eye!

1203
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:06,950
I'm on nivies!

1204
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:08,250
I'm on nivies!

1205
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:11,610
I'm on nivies!

1206
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:12,230
Look at him, look at him!

1207
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:13,510
Okay, it's okay.

1208
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:15,830
It's okay, it's not okay.

1209
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:19,210
It's okay, but it's actually not okay.

1210
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:20,110
It's okay, but it's actually not okay.

1211
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:20,770
It's fine, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

1212
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:21,830
I'm part, I'm part.

1213
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:32,900

01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:38,610
Where's our TP?

1216
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:43,430
Where's our TP?

1217
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:44,970

come over here i got It's fine.

1223
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:32,880
I literally killed Luna.

1224
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,060
I killed Luna

1225
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:50,580
Bro, oh my god Everyone's a healer terrorist.

1226
01:36:51,460 --> 01:37:22,320
I'm I'm going in I was like I'm contributing to the terrorism too It's is I don't think we deserve and a win this team i sold by mantis ulting there but at that point i was so tilted i was like we're just committing you fucking did this we're committing i got up terrorized i'm fucking avoiding this guy holy that was the most fucking stupid thing he could have done holy shit

1227
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:59,880
no it's fine no you saw him he fucking walked walk back I swear to God did they were like we don't need TP someone must have said that because like why did he do that why why why did he walk back and like walk forward then back I will say I did throw after I did fuck up by a mantis ulting through that but also because I was like well They can't they don't have much to push.

1228
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,640
So why don't we just get an early fight in right now?

1229
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:09,620
Just get it over with make them use ults Because there was no point at that point we have the TP.

1230
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:13,160
I mean we could have re like they were just so close They were so close.

1231
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:20,360
We might as well just force a fight It makes sense if like yeah, and you know we needed to commit it

1232
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:26,480
It was just doomed

1233
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,360
That TP was actually a game losing.

1234
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,160
It really was.

1235
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:37,560
I was not expecting that.

1236
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:38,220
Yeah.

1237
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,160
I wish I had lose 21.

1238
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,060
It's fine.

1239
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:45,740
I gained like...

1240
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,480
Oh my god.

1241
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:47,140
I was at one game.

1242
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:48,400
I was in a GM match.

1243
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,200
He's not secure.

1244
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,560
He got scared.

1245
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,620
He got scared.

1246
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:08,740
He wasn't secure.

1247
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,140
He sensed it.

1248
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:21,760
I think he's secure, though.

1249
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,040
3-3-5 in 24 hours.

1250
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,520
Invite him now.

1251
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,580
Bro, am I gonna ruin his games?

1252
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:32,620
Do I have that enough spite in me to do that?

1253
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:33,680
Hmm.

1254
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,120
What kind of question?

1255
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:37,520
Am I?

1256
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:37,940
Is that?

1257
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:39,080
Of course I do.

1258
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:40,960
Of course I do.

1259
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,500
You'll be like, who are you?

1260
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,140
I don't know what...

1261
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,480
They added me.

1262
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:55,380
Chat, they added me, by the way.

1263
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,760
I can ask that.

1264
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,320
Who are you?

1265
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:06,310
They're the ones that added me!

1266
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:12,020
I don't know who this guy is.

1267
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:16,080
I'm just asking important questions.

1268
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:22,590
No, I can't just be like, do you want to do...

1269
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:23,490
It's not a carry.

1270
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:24,610
We're going...

1271
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:26,970
It's the opposite direction of carrying.

1272
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:33,730
Bro, I don't even know this guy.

1273
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:35,210
He added me.

1274
01:40:35,650 --> 01:40:36,130
Chat.

1275
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:43,470
I could ask the Kendrick guy, who are you?

1276
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:46,070
Technically, I sort of seen his name around.

1277
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:47,590
But like...

1278
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:50,770
Like, he's like a magic player or something.

1279
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:56,510
And he also added me.

1280
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:03,890
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

1281
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:10,110
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

1282
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:12,590
Stop responding.

1283
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:13,830
I know you're online.

1284
01:41:14,010 --> 01:41:15,070
I see you feeling.

1285
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:19,830
Now, who am I going to banish from this match?

1286
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:25,590
I know you're queuing.

1287
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:28,450
I know you see my message, buddy.

1288
01:41:32,210 --> 01:41:33,930
I asked who you are.

1289
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:35,610
Please respond.

1290
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,260
Oh, do I still have the...

1291
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:48,000
Oh, do I?

1292
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,120
I didn't even realize I still have those tags on.

1293
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:51,100
Let me fix that.

1294
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:54,740
My staff added that when I had that sponsor.

1295
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:57,360
Oh, my God, it does.

1296
01:41:57,460 --> 01:42:00,300
It says Ethereum RPG RTA ad.

1297
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:01,560
Guys, there's no ads.

1298
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,860
It's so cute.

1299
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:06,040
It's not an ad.

1300
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,600
I mean, technically the stream is an ad.

1301
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:10,900
There we go.

1302
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,540
I didn't even realize.

1303
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:13,880
Just rap.

1304
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,660
I'm no one special.

1305
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:16,720
Just Apollo.

1306
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:18,920
Oh.

1307
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:21,020
Why did you add me?

1308
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,000
Alright, here you go.

1309
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,520
You guys want me to run an ad?

1310
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,500
Watch me run an ad and lose 500.

1311
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:37,880
Oh, you're good!

1312
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:38,820
Whoa!

1313
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:42,100
Yay!

1314
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:51,360
Validation.

1315
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:55,060
Let's hope he doesn't watch what happened last game.

1316
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:56,860
I was heavily...

1317
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:58,960
I was low-key throwing.

1318
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,660
But I didn't throw first, chat.

1319
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:05,160
I will say, I didn't throw first.

1320
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,100
Rumor has it you're a pop star.

1321
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:10,860
Any songs on my note?

1322
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:17,660
Big chatter, yeah, I mean, I added someone in my chat to glaze me.

1323
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:25,650
Oh, yeah, I should.

1324
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:27,330
Nice.

1325
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:36,950
I think he's just a regular guy.

1326
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:38,590
I don't even think he knows who I am.

1327
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:41,150
I think he's just a regular man.

1328
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:42,370
Yeah, bro, we had a perfect comp.

1329
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:43,790
Then you went Rafa at Raku.

1330
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:46,210
I don't mind Rafa.

1331
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:48,550
Team up's kind of nice.

1332
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:51,330
Alright.

1333
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:56,110
Alright, man.

1334
01:43:57,970 --> 01:43:59,110
Got the free headshot!

1335
01:43:59,210 --> 01:43:59,770
Let's go!

1336
01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:05,010
Oh, what?

1337
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:08,070
Alright, let's go.

1338
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:09,890
Oh, my star.

1339
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:11,630
Oh, a few damage boosted is not fair.

1340
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:12,650
Like, what is Mantis?

1341
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:40,890

01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:50,450
Oh my god, it's this guy!

1344
01:44:55,450 --> 01:44:55,870
Teleported.

1345
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:01,170
The Bucky on the right.

1346
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:03,710
You sure I'll just interrupt here?

1347
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:04,370
I'm dead.

1348
01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:05,710
Okay.

1349
01:45:07,310 --> 01:45:08,850
That's actually crazy.

1350
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:11,230
Okay, that's too many of us, though.

1351
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:12,790
That's too many of us.

1352
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:16,990
that's way too many odds

1353
01:45:20,910 --> 01:45:44,590

1354
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:51,550
Oh my god, I'm such a fool!

1355
01:45:52,330 --> 01:45:54,870
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot another damage!

1356
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:55,810
Oh, I'm goodbye, I'm dead.

1357
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:57,750
I'm dead.

1358
01:45:58,510 --> 01:45:59,370
I'm stalling on point.

1359
01:46:01,570 --> 01:46:01,850
Goodbye.

1360
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:06,330
I know.

1361
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:08,650
What the fuck is my team did?

1362
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:10,730
What do you mean, wise?

1363
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:15,090
We got Eden!

1364
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:18,810
Maybe Iron Man ult to shuffle.

1365
01:46:20,670 --> 01:46:21,170

01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:42,250

1374
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:44,060

01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:48,140

01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:03,170
Oh, this is oh my god.

1380
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:07,610

Oh my god, he didn't get us.

1384
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,860
He didn't get us!

1385
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:13,530
I tried so hard!

1386
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:17,970
We have one fight left.

1387
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:20,630
I knew he had JFL too.

1388
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:23,380
All right, here I go.

1389
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:24,770

01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,350
I'm coming in.

1391
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:28,470
I'm coming in.

1392
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:32,010
It's so much harder to farm up to a Mantis win.

1393
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:38,420
When there's like so many shields going in.

1394
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:43,940
Here you go, sir.

1395
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,320
Is that what you need?

1396
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:49,140
Here's two more damage boosts.

1397
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:51,280
Oh my god, here's more.

1398
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,300
Oh my god, bro, I got bounced away.

1399
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:04,820
I killed both, oh my god.

1400
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,640
Go, Styler, go!

1401
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:11,860
Styler, go!

1402
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,940
Fucking carry us!

1403
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,500
You know what, he deserves the damage boost.

1404
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:19,060
What the fuck am I doing?

1405
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:23,060
What the fuck?

1406
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:38,280
wow i like ignored my starlord and my starlord with zero damage boost literally clutched that fight for us

1407
01:49:45,410 --> 01:50:27,530
this peter has an actual plan he actually knows what he's doing i'm not doing a lot of damage it's so hard to farm there the supports are also like to take off angles but I'm worried about my supports if I take off it um I'm gonna try and take more off angles here I'm sort of worried about my supports as I play PL more than dps because I am not farming damage I'm literally just being I'm nearly being like a fucking damage bot wait wait I'm gonna try to alt and bait something out actually no I'm holding for fucking search I'm like literally ult baiting.

1408
01:50:27,810 --> 01:50:30,370
I'm literally like, damage botting right now.

1409
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:36,050
Alright, let's go.

1410
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:37,130
Are y'all ready?

1411
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:41,770
Oh my god, oh yes, boost.

1412
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:44,390
We are undefeatable!

1413
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:46,750
You already had damage boost!

1414
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:47,730
Holy shit!

1415
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:48,650
What do you...

1416
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:57,990
You already had damage boost and he's like, Where's my damage boost?

1417
01:50:58,430 --> 01:50:58,970
Where is it?

1418
01:50:59,510 --> 01:51:02,110
What do you mean?

1419
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:04,350
Oh my god.

1420
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:06,370
Oh my god.

1421
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:08,930
Oh my god.

1422
01:51:09,230 --> 01:51:10,090
Oh my god.

1423
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:11,330
Oh my god.

1424
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:15,410
Where's that rocket?

1425
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:17,630
That's the thing.

1426
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:19,150
Rocket dead.

1427
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,630
Rocket dead.

1428
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:21,670
Okay.

1429
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:27,630
Oh my god.

1430
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:30,210
I'm just stalling as long Oh, wait, he ults it.

1431
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:32,230
Wait, when did we rocket ults it?

1432
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:33,790
I didn't even realize.

1433
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:37,890
He wants, he wants more.

1434
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:44,770
Bro, I don't think he realized that damage boost only goes up twice.

1435
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:47,250
The hell's on the right.

1436
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:52,980
I don't think he really stacks up twice.

1437
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,240
How do you want more?

1438
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,700
I can't even give you more.

1439
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:11,200

Oh my.

1443
01:52:42,450 --> 01:52:44,350
This is bad.

1444
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:46,010
That's fine.

1445
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:46,590
I used a lot.

1446
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:47,970
Goodbye.

1447
01:52:48,850 --> 01:52:50,870
Oh, we're staggered as hell.

1448
01:52:52,990 --> 01:52:53,610
Oh my god.

1449
01:52:53,670 --> 01:52:55,330
It's all the supports too.

1450
01:52:56,950 --> 01:52:57,850
He's not in BC.

1451
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:05,800
All right, here you go.

1452
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:18,440

1454
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,290
Jesus Christ.

1455
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:45,430
What did I hit?

1456
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:49,430
Jesus.

1457
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:54,170
Okay, it's fine.

1458
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:55,210
Starlord, you go.

1459
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:55,870
You're next.

1460
01:53:57,390 --> 01:53:58,710
You're next, Starlord.

1461
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:00,750
Oh, my gosh.

1462
01:54:05,970 --> 01:54:07,350
This is why I don't play Luna.

1463
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:09,550
This is absolutely why I don't.

1464
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:11,250
No!

1465
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:12,010
Goodbye!

1466
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:16,350
See, this is why I don't play Luna.

1467
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:18,170
That would have been me.

1468
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:21,790
Yes, but have you tried more damage boost?

1469
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:25,610
I'm sorry, it was my bad.

1470
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:26,790
I should have damage boost.

1471
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,230
Why is the horse here?

1472
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:34,330
Why is it?

1473
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:35,530
Oh my god, this guy.

1474
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:38,310
Is this why we haven't had a single friend?

I'm back at spawn.

1482
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:37,800
Jesus Christ.

1483
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:38,720
Number one strange.

1484
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,120
Oh, my God.

1485
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:40,820

1486
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:41,700
What's going on?

1487
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:42,560
What's going on?

1488
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:44,800
What's going on?

1489
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:49,960
Oh, I was so confused.

1490
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:51,240

I was like, whoa.

1493
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:28,610
I guess I'm here now.

1494
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:30,950
Thank god.

1495
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:32,350
They didn't kill me.

1496
01:56:32,890 --> 01:56:33,270
Yurk.

1497
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:33,790
Nice.

1498
01:56:34,190 --> 01:56:34,510
Nice.

1499
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:36,370
I got complimented, guys.

1500
01:56:37,390 --> 01:56:38,530
I love getting.

1501
01:56:39,010 --> 01:56:39,930
Alright, did he win?

1502
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:40,690
You know what?

1503
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:42,270
Oh, I can't spectate him.

1504
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:43,410
He has it locked.

1505
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:46,290
I want to know if he wins or not.

1506
01:56:51,070 --> 01:56:53,130
I'll be like...

1507
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:53,270
Oh.

1508
01:56:53,290 --> 01:56:54,790
Oh, man, is that fucked up?

1509
01:56:55,310 --> 01:56:59,550
If we start losing and I get him out of top 500, how fucked up would that be?

1510
01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:00,970
This is a regular guy.

1511
01:57:01,070 --> 01:57:05,790
Because if it's a pro player, at least I can say, hey, at least you get paid professionally to play, right?

1512
01:57:06,050 --> 01:57:11,390
But this guy is a regular man who's literally playing this as a hobby and it's all he has.

1513
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:14,350
Like, this is like his happy time after work.

1514
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:19,350
So I'm like, I feel like that's more fucked up than getting a...

1515
01:57:23,290 --> 01:57:29,110
he's playing this after work like this is like his joy after a day at work

1516
01:57:32,270 --> 01:57:36,470
don't you're bringing him to an air layer of hell

1517
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:50,020
no joy for him but there's joy for me

1518
01:57:53,400 --> 01:58:51,320
all right let's do it hey you want to do it you are just you're just a menace not that i'm not that bad of a person oh i'll get in here i'll check if he won or lost if he lost i'm like i could be the devil on the shoulder and be like oh i can maybe if you play with someone else you'll have more wins you know just maybe i'm not the type who fits quietly into the background do i have teammates with skulls and their brains in their skulls or am i afk off the rip i don't care at this point what now who am i gonna vanish from this match that's a great way to start the game the fucking clanker tired of clanker whoa i think this guy had a day of playing.

1519
01:58:51,740 --> 01:58:55,320
I don't think this guy had a good day of rink, guys.

1520
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:03,420
Guys, I think his games have been pretty rough.

1521
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,540
I'm pretty sure he has not had a good time.

1522
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:10,940
I'm manning Adam.

1523
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:12,880
I'm tired of fucking Solvon 2.

1524
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,620
Bro, what do you like?

1525
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:17,880
What do you like?

1526
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:20,000
Wait, what about Tori?

1527
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:22,140
If...

1528
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:22,460
Oh, wait.

1529
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:23,360
They banned...

1530
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:23,580
Oh.

1531
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,420
Like, I don't think you should, like, have much...

1532
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:31,980
Have any standards if you're a penny one trick.

1533
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:35,780
He's definitely crashing out.

1534
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:37,980
Like, I'm like, how do you have standards?

1535
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:39,280
You're a penny player.

1536
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:41,420
You're...

1537
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:43,800
Bro.

1538
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:45,840
You should have the lowest...

1539
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:46,700
They have garbantua.

1540
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:48,580
Then why didn't you ban Jeff?

1541
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:49,660
What?

1542
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:50,800
What?

1543
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:53,320
What?

1544
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:57,500
Oh, by the way, they have a Jeff 1 trick.

1545
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:59,320
Forgot to tell you about this.

1546
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,760
Anyway, I'm banning Adam.

1547
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:03,720
I ban Adam.

1548
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:10,360
If they have a Jeff 1 trick, then why didn't you ban Jeff?

1549
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:13,980
Alright, let's run this.

1550
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:16,900
People...

1551
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:17,920
Oh my gosh.

1552
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:19,900
We let him control the bans.

1553
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:29,520
Somehow he still fucked up the bans He's grieving he's grieving his own game and he's like do I have actual teammates in my team on my team?

1554
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:30,360
I don't know.

1555
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:31,960
Are you an actual teammate?

1556
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:41,020
Like you are your own demise You're barely fit the definition of a teammate right now Clearly we win in this game Kai.

1557
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:54,420
Oh, by the way, Kai The people on our team last game were a three stack of GM's yeah made sense afterwards What is what is going on?

1558
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:57,800
He's actually going to shoot a penny nest if their life depended on it.

1559
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,960
Oh my god.

1560
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:01,280
I have Jeff.

1561
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:03,760
Yeah, no shit they have Jeff.

1562
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:06,540
We used it in fucking bad Jeff.

1563
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:08,600
Come on, we have a thing.

1564
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:09,580
Yep.

1565
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:10,540
I want to play on that.

1566
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:14,960
Phoenix is not in the top side.

1567
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:17,220
Okay.

1568
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,100
We're not.

1569
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:20,000
Okay.

1570
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:42,900

1571
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:51,720
Oh, yeah.

1572
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:52,760
A multiness?

1573
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:56,440
Push up?

1574
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:57,900
Smack, smack, smack.

1575
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:06,880
Okay, that's fine.

1576
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:09,600
Oh, where am I?

1577
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:16,120
Where did I go?

1578
02:02:17,860 --> 02:02:19,380
Where did I go?

1579
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:20,980
How did I- You're the Beyblade.

1580
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:21,700
You're the Beyblade.

1581
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:26,180
How did I- Gosh, it's not binding, bro.

1582
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:31,280
There we go.

1583
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:32,880
Alright.

1584
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:34,260
You gotta bind this here.

1585
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:36,100
Abuse it for the last 24 hours.

1586
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:37,620
Awesome, Mona.

1587
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:38,700
Thank you for the raid.

1588
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:39,720
Thank you.

1589
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:41,780
I hope you have a good stream.

1590
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:42,560
Oh no.

1591
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:43,200
No, I was.

1592
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:43,720
I actually was.

1593
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:45,020
I literally clicked the button this time.

1594
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:45,960
Uh, but hello everybody.

1595
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:49,100
I am, um, I am Elo terrorizing right now.

1596
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,240
I'm trying to keep top 500 from everyone.

1597
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:54,160
Because if I can't keep top 500, no one can.

1598
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:54,960
Oh, no, I'm not throwing.

1599
02:02:55,060 --> 02:02:55,780
I'm not throwing, by the way.

1600
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:00,160
I've just been having very unlucky games, so I'm granting my...

1601
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:06,700
I'm granting my negative aura to the rest of my team.

1602
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:09,980
Focus cap.

1603
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:13,080
I'm all up.

1604
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:15,220
I'll keep them from running around.

1605
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:18,320
Get that cap, Etono.

1606
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:25,340
I missed grab.

1607
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:27,540
It's fine.

1608
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:31,280
Uh...

1609
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:32,960
I'm...

1610
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:33,900
Okay, it's fine.

1611
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:35,280
We don't need all anything.

1612
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:36,920
Holy shit!

1613
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:37,650
Wait, this...

1614
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:41,580
The enemy team is so passive.

1615
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:44,080
They're so passive.

1616
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:45,120
I'm holding W.

1617
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:46,860
I want to eat them.

1618
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:48,920
Om yum yum yum yum!

1619
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:51,160
Eat these guys!

1620
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:51,800
Om yum!

1621
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:54,160
Oh my god.

1622
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:55,580
Oh my god, there's...

1623
02:03:55,620 --> 02:04:17,000
There's a lot of people now Let's just play up here and die here They should be able to touch Bro, I don't even think you can die I don't they're doom cute Hello, hey Hey, you try to run away?

1624
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:29,300
Oh no running away donkeys here I'm gonna take your illo Oh, you thought you could get top 500 in 24 hours?

1625
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:30,980
Think again.

1626
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:35,360
Nobody's getting top 500 in my lobbies.

1627
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:38,320
I'm so far away from top 500.

1628
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,840
I technically need a win.

1629
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:44,520
Five, six games in a row.

1630
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:47,260
And that's a fucking sad dream.

1631
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:48,300
I almost have my own.

1632
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:48,540
Yeah.

1633
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:51,580
Let's just push up.

1634
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:54,060
And let's prevent.

1635
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:58,900
Oh

1636
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:20,120
He didn't even get in Yeah Where's my goddamn combo?

1637
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:28,560
I didn't put any stacks on them Where the fuck I was not to?

1638
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:31,380
Where's my combo?

1639
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,780
What the fuck was that all?

1640
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:50,080
That was a fucking fast asshole.

1641
02:05:50,340 --> 02:06:28,100
Yeah, that was a fast ass that push Wasn't your fault bro that portal was like low-key questionable I'm your brother you saw the support it was right there if we were on triple support and had a casual DPS we would have killed them this guy's coping how long I'm gonna check how long he's been playing for a specific comp it has to be cloak Adam 2 DPS bar none the strat works if you do that if you do anything other than that it fails 90% of the time if you do exactly that it works 90% of the time I got checkers he has to be on the 16th hour mark right This guy looks like he's been through it.

1642
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:29,500
Like, you know, like, penny mines are there.

1643
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:30,600
They'll be coming.

1644
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:32,480
Yes, that's what the soul bond is for.

1645
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:33,940
We live through that.

1646
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:36,780
There's not enough mines to kill us.

1647
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:37,860
But we didn't look.

1648
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:39,280
We didn't die to the penny mines.

1649
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:41,340
We died because we didn't have enough damage.

1650
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:44,660
We died at, like, five, like...

1651
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:46,480
He is not okay.

1652
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:47,520
Kill them or kill us.

1653
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:50,140
He is not having a good day, guys.

1654
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:50,960
Look, he's been...

1655
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:54,880
I bet you he was, like, maybe, like, one game off of top 500.

1656
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:56,800
Securement?

1657
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,860
You know, sometimes the best defense is a good offense.

1658
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:00,420
And then he lost seven games in a row.

1659
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:02,440
Just like me.

1660
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:05,020
Just like me.

1661
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:06,140
Oh my god!

1662
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:12,900
Guys, I don't think there was a way for me to save anyone.

1663
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:14,360
They're pushing top.

1664
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,020
Oh my god, there is a pushing top.

1665
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:20,740
Oh my god.

1666
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:21,840
Okay, don't worry.

1667
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:22,360
We can...

1668
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:23,840
Oh, we only did that three minutes?

1669
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:25,500
No, that's not fast at all.

1670
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:26,500
Don't give up so easy.

1671
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:32,010
All right, we've fucked up a little bit guys just a little

1672
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:46,170
All right, I should have just dropped down I got scared I was like oh my god, what if I just what maybe he won't run after me, you know

1673
02:07:52,090 --> 02:07:54,010
Okay, all right, let's go all right nice.

1674
02:07:54,570 --> 02:07:55,470
Hello, man.

1675
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:56,210
Don't worry.

1676
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:59,430
I'm here I'm here, Mag.

1677
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:00,530
Oh my god.

1678
02:08:02,890 --> 02:08:03,290
Please.

1679
02:08:07,370 --> 02:08:10,530
Okay, there you go.

1680
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:13,750
I felt like I was living by one HP right there.

1681
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:16,270
This is so scary.

1682
02:08:18,570 --> 02:08:21,910
I don't know if you can hear me just clicking my mouse spamming it right now.

1683
02:08:23,190 --> 02:08:24,830
I'm just like, oh my god, please don't let me die.

1684
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:26,250
Please don't let me die, please.

1685
02:08:28,430 --> 02:08:30,350
I'm so scared.

1686
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:31,510
Oh.

1687
02:08:38,490 --> 02:08:38,650
Oh.

1688
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:40,410
Oh.

1689
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:41,230
Goodbye, everyone.

1690
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:42,910
Goodbye.

1691
02:08:44,030 --> 02:08:45,690
Goodbye, everybody.

1692
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:46,930
Oh, it's me.

1693
02:08:47,430 --> 02:08:49,290
God damn it, it was me!

1694
02:08:51,450 --> 02:08:53,690
Why is it always me?

1695
02:08:56,030 --> 02:08:57,970
Oh, no, we that used to end this.

1696
02:08:58,410 --> 02:09:00,210
No, she got swallowed.

1697
02:09:00,370 --> 02:09:01,330
I have to go all the way up.

1698
02:09:02,410 --> 02:09:03,490
I got swallowed.

1699
02:09:03,830 --> 02:09:04,590
It's different.

1700
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:05,630
I think we make four.

1701
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:06,290
I'll be down.

1702
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:08,030
Oh, my God.

1703
02:09:08,210 --> 02:09:08,590
We don't.

1704
02:09:09,790 --> 02:09:10,290
We don't.

1705
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:13,050
All right.

1706
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:13,990
That wasn't me.

1707
02:09:14,050 --> 02:09:14,770
I got eaten.

1708
02:09:14,890 --> 02:09:15,810
That's just bad luck.

1709
02:09:18,110 --> 02:09:18,590
What did I?

1710
02:09:18,670 --> 02:09:19,910
I didn't do anything wrong.

1711
02:09:20,030 --> 02:09:20,770
I was eaten.

1712
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:25,190
Someone had to get eaten.

1713
02:09:25,330 --> 02:09:26,350
It was me or Luna.

1714
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:28,410
That's why I couldn't go in.

1715
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:53,350
invisible too because I I like debated I should have just let my Phoenix die he was gonna die regardless I was like oh I could let's move up cake space I could like um um stay invisible and not get eaten but that was like no I should I should try and save I'm all in three two one I was too good of a person.

1716
02:09:53,530 --> 02:09:53,550
They did.

1717
02:09:53,770 --> 02:09:54,610
They thought that so early.

1718
02:09:54,930 --> 02:09:55,750
Yeah, they did.

1719
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:57,110
Wait.

1720
02:09:57,710 --> 02:09:58,530
Ah, so sorry.

1721
02:09:59,210 --> 02:09:59,750
Kill this guy.

1722
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:00,930
Okay.

1723
02:10:02,090 --> 02:10:03,050
That's fine.

1724
02:10:05,450 --> 02:10:09,590
I had to push, pull them back though.

1725
02:10:10,610 --> 02:10:11,870
We have to kill something.

1726
02:10:12,130 --> 02:10:12,650
Come on.

1727
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:13,350
Come on.

1728
02:10:13,610 --> 02:10:14,770
Kill some guys.

1729
02:10:15,190 --> 02:10:16,290
Kill something.

1730
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:16,650
Oh.

1731
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:19,010
Oh my god.

1732
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:19,310
Nobody.

1733
02:10:19,490 --> 02:10:19,850
Don't shot it.

1734
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:20,010
Yes.

1735
02:10:20,110 --> 02:10:20,310
Nice.

1736
02:10:21,290 --> 02:10:21,770
No.

1737
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:26,950
I caught it.

1738
02:10:27,410 --> 02:10:28,910
No, the Jeff!

1739
02:10:31,550 --> 02:10:33,850
Oh no, they're pushing just as fast as us.

1740
02:10:35,690 --> 02:10:37,130
Do you need to go like triple support?

1741
02:10:37,690 --> 02:10:39,690
They're pushing it just as fast!

1742
02:10:41,690 --> 02:10:43,050
This is bad guys.

1743
02:10:43,390 --> 02:10:44,030
This is bad.

1744
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:45,610
We gotta take an early fight.

1745
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:49,210
I could go C&D and just play like a Wanda when I'm not healing.

1746
02:10:50,830 --> 02:10:52,370
No, I think I'm just gonna play Poke on their back.

1747
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:59,410
all right this is bad

1748
02:11:04,570 --> 02:11:15,890

1753
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:37,060
We don't need to off angle.

1754
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:37,860
Jesus Christ.

1755
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:38,380
Oh my god.

1756
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:39,520
We need to contest it though.

1757
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:40,580
And we don't contest it.

1758
02:12:40,660 --> 02:12:41,740
And then they just get free picks.

1759
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:45,300
It's all falling apart.

1760
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:48,080
I thought we were a team.

1761
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:49,840
What happened?

1762
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:52,900
Because everything's falling apart.

1763
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:55,140
We were so...

1764
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:56,900
There's going to be a button on your monitor.

1765
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:57,540
We were so happy.

1766
02:12:57,540 --> 02:13:00,360
I'm going to need you to click that and turn your fucking screen on.

1767
02:13:00,780 --> 02:13:01,340
Jesus Christ.

1768
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:02,040
We were so happy.

1769
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:04,040
What happened?

1770
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:15,160
Like do we want to go goats and just fucking triple support triple tank fucking stall it out Everybody was so happy What happened?

1771
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:28,980
All right, hi, please stop getting fucking picked with love a fucking guy I'll play with my hold up put the fucking snowflake on him.

1772
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:31,960
He needs to He doesn't need it bro.

1773
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,480
He clicks a button and he gets 50 shields, bro What are they doing?

1774
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:37,460
He's been dying.

1775
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:38,620
I think she needs it.

1776
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:39,200
Whoa!

1777
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:43,460
The battle starts in five.

1778
02:13:43,640 --> 02:13:44,860
Guys, what happened to us?

1779
02:13:44,980 --> 02:13:47,100
We were doing so well.

1780
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:49,860
Why didn't the NAP just give up?

1781
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:54,960
The Guardians of the Galaxy are misfits.

1782
02:13:58,260 --> 02:14:00,240
It pleases me to be helpful.

1783
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:00,700
Compromised.

1784
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:02,520
Yeah.

1785
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:06,480
There you go.

1786
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:07,780
I'll just pocket him.

1787
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:12,870
There you go.

1788
02:14:17,710 --> 02:14:18,830
We'll just...

1789
02:14:18,830 --> 02:14:20,330
There you go.

1790
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:23,800
Okay, I can't.

1791
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:25,380
Oh my god, I can't.

1792
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,820
Oh my god, I try to drop down.

1793
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:31,320
Oh, I'm dropping down.

1794
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:31,980
That's unlucky.

1795
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,640
That's unlucky.

1796
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,020
Fantastic, absolute.

1797
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:40,980
I should have dropped down straight away.

1798
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:44,020
But I was like, I would eagled it too much.

1799
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:47,020
That was fun, though.

1800
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:48,420
Playing with my hella.

1801
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
And I used myself as bait.

1802
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:01,200
I either die or run.

1803
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:01,840
Die or run.

1804
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:06,140
It's TP.

1805
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:08,500
Oh, no, that's the whole point.

1806
02:15:08,660 --> 02:15:10,960
If we lose this point, even with TP, then we're fucked.

1807
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:12,060
We need to just regroup.

1808
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:12,920
That's what we need.

1809
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:15,080
Oh, he's TP.

1810
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:15,900
Okay.

1811
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:17,120
TP!

1812
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:20,880
Okay.

1813
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:24,300
I'm gonna go TP, I guess.

1814
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:26,960
Okay.

1815
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:30,680
Oh.

1816
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:34,260
What?

1817
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:37,400
What?

1818
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:40,360
Um, I don't know.

1819
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:41,300
That's just my luck.

1820
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:42,620
Oh my god.

1821
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:43,820
And that is why we don't TP.

1822
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:47,940
What's going on?

1823
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:48,940
We had time to walk.

1824
02:15:49,660 --> 02:15:52,140
We GG's now because it's a fucking hour to walk back.

1825
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:56,460
Like I said, we wasted TP.

1826
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:00,140
What's going on?

1827
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:01,020
We had time to walk.

1828
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:02,640
We did not need to do that.

1829
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:05,260
What's going on?

1830
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:07,760
And now we're playing Rocket into fucking Phoenix.

1831
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:09,360
Even more GG's.

1832
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:12,780
This fucking lock...

1833
02:16:12,780 --> 02:16:14,440
Oh my god, I can't...

Guys, we can't check, guys.

1841
02:18:08,070 --> 02:18:10,070
He has hidden his profile.

1842
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:12,570
This guy has not been happy for a long time.

1843
02:18:12,730 --> 02:18:13,570
It's okay, buddy.

1844
02:18:14,070 --> 02:18:15,210

Just be like me.

1846
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:19,590
Stream it all out.

1847
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:24,770
Wait, he's doing with Kai.

1848
02:18:24,970 --> 02:18:27,470
So, like, maybe his profile is public.

1849
02:18:27,810 --> 02:18:30,850
Four, three, two, one.

1850
02:18:32,590 --> 02:18:36,850
The only issue is that I'm not building my ult fast enough.

1851
02:18:48,260 --> 02:18:49,000
Okay.

1852
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:54,360

1855
02:19:06,030 --> 02:19:08,170
I can't do anything about it.

1856
02:19:08,410 --> 02:19:10,250
Let's hope that Hella wins this fight.

1857
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:13,650

1904
02:22:39,210 --> 02:22:43,010
These guys, all they had to do was literally pocket Arhella.

1905
02:22:43,930 --> 02:22:45,610
Arhella did everything.

1906
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:49,650
Like, I was literally following him around for the longest time.

1907
02:22:49,930 --> 02:22:51,690
He actually did everything.

1908
02:22:51,930 --> 02:22:55,670
And these two fuckers were just gapping away.

1909
02:22:55,910 --> 02:22:57,350

Would you like some water?

02:23:34,650 --> 02:23:35,410
Wait, he won.

1925
02:23:35,510 --> 02:23:36,430
Wait, why did he...

1926
02:23:36,450 --> 02:23:37,630
Hide his history!

1927
02:23:38,050 --> 02:23:38,790
Why did he...

1928
02:23:40,650 --> 02:23:42,150
What did he want?

1929
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:43,550
Why did you hide?

1930
02:23:43,770 --> 02:23:44,930
What are you hiding?

1931
02:23:46,570 --> 02:23:49,930
Did he know I was stalking his profile?

1932
02:23:50,550 --> 02:23:52,170
Why is he hiding?

1933
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:53,830
Oh, shit.

1934
02:23:54,210 --> 02:23:56,010
Oh, shit.

1935
02:23:57,430 --> 02:23:58,070
Okay.

1936
02:23:59,870 --> 02:24:00,730
Oh, yeah.

1937
02:24:01,010 --> 02:24:02,570
No, things were not okay for it.

1938
02:24:03,130 --> 02:24:03,890
Oh, now.

1939
02:24:04,370 --> 02:24:04,710
Oh.

1940
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:06,430
Now.

1941
02:24:06,450 --> 02:24:07,790
I understand.

1942
02:24:09,370 --> 02:24:10,790
There it is.

1943
02:24:11,590 --> 02:24:13,050
There it is.

1944
02:24:13,670 --> 02:24:14,550
Oh, bro.

1945
02:24:15,010 --> 02:24:17,650
Bro, this guy was Celestia 1, bro.

1946
02:24:18,290 --> 02:24:19,930
Why did you keep playing?

1947
02:24:20,490 --> 02:24:23,570
Oh, that is a reasonable crashout.

1948
02:24:23,910 --> 02:24:25,790
No, that's reasonable.

1949
02:24:26,230 --> 02:24:27,290
This guy was Celestia.

1950
02:24:27,370 --> 02:24:29,210
Why did you keep playing?

1951
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:30,790
You locked it.

1952
02:24:31,090 --> 02:24:33,870
You actually secured it.

1953
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:35,830
What's wrong with you?

1954
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:38,410
You had it in the bag.

1955
02:24:39,990 --> 02:24:43,110
No, this guy was the one that says, sorry, he's in his profile.

1956
02:24:44,010 --> 02:24:44,570
This guy.

1957
02:24:46,530 --> 02:24:47,270
This guy.

1958
02:24:48,270 --> 02:24:52,550
He, um, I don't know why he fucking kept going.

1959
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:55,250
He is, he should have, he was Celestia 1.

1960
02:24:55,650 --> 02:24:57,350
He fucked up.

1961
02:25:00,130 --> 02:25:01,670
I was not secure.

1962
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:04,610
I kept going because I wasn't secure, though.

1963
02:25:04,810 --> 02:25:05,810
That's the thing.

1964
02:25:06,970 --> 02:25:07,930
What if...

1965
02:25:07,930 --> 02:25:09,490
Wait, okay, where is this guy?

1966
02:25:11,290 --> 02:25:11,990
Oh, he...

1967
02:25:11,990 --> 02:25:13,170
Wait, is he a peer offline?

1968
02:25:13,410 --> 02:25:14,810
Or was he like, this is it?

1969
02:25:14,950 --> 02:25:15,710
I'm done.

1970
02:25:18,090 --> 02:25:19,690
I'm fucking done.

1971
02:25:20,970 --> 02:25:22,350
Oh, no, he's a peer offline.

1972
02:25:22,490 --> 02:25:24,810
Oh, he's crashing, crashing out.

1973
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:27,570
He went from Celestial 1 to Celestial.

1974
02:25:27,710 --> 02:25:28,570
That's understandable.

1975
02:25:29,350 --> 02:25:29,830
That's...

1976
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:30,550
That's understandable.

1977
02:25:30,970 --> 02:25:32,230
Where is the other guy?

1978
02:25:32,950 --> 02:25:33,510
This guy.

1979
02:25:35,150 --> 02:25:36,430
This guy is...

1980
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:37,990
Oh.

1981
02:25:40,490 --> 02:25:40,930
Alright.

1982
02:25:42,310 --> 02:25:43,130
He's secure.

1983
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:43,730
He wasn't.

1984
02:25:43,770 --> 02:25:45,310
He's not gonna keep going.

1985
02:25:45,690 --> 02:25:48,130
I mean, that's a lot of points.

1986
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:49,510
I'm gonna go pee real quick.

1987
02:25:49,630 --> 02:25:50,150

1988
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:50,730

I got you guys.

1990
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:53,810

But we don't know his name.

2117
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:08,560
That's the worst part.

2118
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:09,980
What did we do?

2119
02:36:10,060 --> 02:36:11,220
It was, like, Vortex, right?

2120
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:12,980
Why did he admit that?

2121
02:36:13,980 --> 02:36:16,860
Why did he kind of fork it?

2122
02:36:19,460 --> 02:36:20,660
That's his name, right?

2123
02:36:20,940 --> 02:36:21,620

02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:23,060

Oh, is it Crafty?

2134
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:42,040
Oh, it was Crafty.

2135
02:36:42,260 --> 02:36:43,580
This guy was dodging.

2136
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:44,960
Wait, is it an alt account?

2137
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:47,600

02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:48,100

2139
02:36:49,340 --> 02:36:53,380

2140
02:36:53,820 --> 02:36:55,380
Wait, did I spell it?

2141
02:36:55,380 --> 02:36:56,640
T-T-Y-Y-Y?

2142
02:36:57,860 --> 02:37:03,200
Oh, bro, this man is... God on an off- alt account.

2143
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:11,460
It's fucking... Oh, that guy was actually like on an alt account to help his buddy.

2144
02:37:12,020 --> 02:37:12,280
Yeah.

2145
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:14,820
It's level 37.

2146
02:37:15,460 --> 02:37:16,680
There's no way.

2147
02:37:19,340 --> 02:38:17,600
it's level 37 this guy was actually dodging for his hope honestly for his homie no not win trading basically um if it's an unwinnable game so it was it's basically the overwatch um um it's the overwatch strat that was the issue um people did this all the time in overwatch and that's the problem and that's the problem in current marvel rivals if you do with someone who is on an alt account or like who's on an account that they don't care about they would just leave the game the their part the duo partner will just leave the game and the match will cancel and then nobody loses anything and uh everyone would use to do that in overwatch and back then in overwatch there was a thing where you can just disconnect and reconnect so fast that you yourself don't even lose anything um but they patch that so people will just do the alt account thing where they'll just do it with an alt account but then if the match is unwinnable they just leave in the first minute that you don't lose anything like

2148
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:43,720
the match just cancels and people just do that uh in in rank so it's like a unwinnable game to get top 500 in overwatch and i think in marvel rivals too um don't do that i'm not endorsing that i'm not i guess me giving you guys this tactic is not endorsing it i'm just sharing the not don't do that because you heard it from me if you do it Don't say you heard it from me.

2149
02:38:44,140 --> 02:38:47,280
Say you heard it from like, uh, what's his name?

2150
02:38:47,660 --> 02:38:48,020
Vortikek.

2151
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:52,960
Oh, if anyone asks, you heard it from this guy.

2152
02:38:52,980 --> 02:38:56,160
This guy taught you about the dodge.

2153
02:39:00,020 --> 02:39:04,760
This guy, this guy told you about the dodge strat.

2154

2155
02:39:06,100 --> 02:39:08,300

It's so sad.

2160
02:40:20,150 --> 02:40:21,470

02:40:21,470 --> 02:40:24,530
And like, current top 500 is cut off is Celestial 2.

2162

Unless I do rank the GM.

2167
02:40:34,590 --> 02:40:35,510
Unless I...

2168
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:36,710
It could happen.

2169
02:40:36,890 --> 02:40:37,630
It could happen.

2170
02:40:37,770 --> 02:40:39,010
The knight is still young.

2171
02:40:39,150 --> 02:40:40,230
It's still there.

2172
02:40:40,690 --> 02:40:41,950
Still a possibility.

2173
02:40:44,810 --> 02:40:47,290
The night is still young.

2174
02:40:48,330 --> 02:40:51,430
I can still fuck up my life a little bit more.

2175
02:40:59,970 --> 02:41:00,710

I think I do.

2179
02:41:13,590 --> 02:41:16,190
It's up to us to help the people who can't help themselves.

2180
02:41:16,570 --> 02:41:16,710

02:44:59,090 --> 02:44:59,470
Thank God.

2224
02:45:00,270 --> 02:45:03,470
Ah, I guess I'll play Luna.

2225
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:10,030
It's good.

2226
02:45:10,210 --> 02:45:11,010
You guys would love it.

2227
02:45:13,930 --> 02:45:15,350
You guys are gonna love it.

2228
02:45:20,650 --> 02:45:24,450
Our DPS is Hawkeye and then Moon Knight.

2229
02:45:24,830 --> 02:45:26,250
I have very high hopes.

2230
02:45:29,990 --> 02:45:32,050
We had five Jeffs and a Phoenix.

2231
02:45:33,150 --> 02:45:33,730
Four Jeffs.

2232
02:45:33,790 --> 02:45:35,770
What the fuck are they talking about?

2233
02:45:35,930 --> 02:45:37,090
Are they talking about the band phase?

2234
02:45:40,940 --> 02:45:41,800
Who do I...

2235
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:43,560
I guess I'll do Moon Knight.

2236
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:45,380
I'm like, who do I even snowflake?

2237
02:45:45,480 --> 02:45:47,860
This is a stupid fucking English snowflake.

2238
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:52,840
I need to use my seed more.

2239
02:45:56,340 --> 02:45:56,420
Yay!

2240
02:45:57,700 --> 02:45:58,500
Yippee!

2241
02:45:59,940 --> 02:46:04,420
Five, four, three, two, one!

2242
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:05,980
Let's go.

2243
02:46:05,980 --> 02:46:07,800
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

2244
02:46:08,380 --> 02:46:08,900
Got it?

2245
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:11,620
It's winnable.

2246
02:46:13,580 --> 02:46:15,380
Where are they?

2247
02:46:16,320 --> 02:46:17,660
Oh, there they are.

2248
02:46:18,540 --> 02:46:24,220
I was like, how can I make it winnable if I don't even see them?

2249
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:31,600
How the fuck did he take so much?

2250
02:46:31,980 --> 02:46:36,280
How the fuck did he take so much damage?

2251
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:40,060
Like, do you have to put this on our Emma?

2252
02:46:42,340 --> 02:46:43,980
Oh, I missed the freeze.

2253
02:46:44,200 --> 02:46:44,900
That's my bad.

2254
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:45,800
I haven't played Emma.

2255
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:46,460
Oh.

2256
02:46:47,310 --> 02:46:50,140
Guys, I'm a little concerned here.

2257
02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:51,660
Guys, I don't think it's winnable anymore.

2258
02:46:51,800 --> 02:46:52,960
I don't think it's winnable anymore.

2259
02:46:53,180 --> 02:46:58,480
I- Hey, guys.

2260
02:46:59,080 --> 02:46:59,700
Guys, I-

2261
02:47:02,870 --> 02:47:09,330
Guys, I- I don't think it's winnable anymore, guys.

2262
02:47:10,890 --> 02:47:14,830
This- This, that team...

2263
02:47:16,150 --> 02:47:23,010
Bro, we just used Every U-tail possible for this guy.

2264
02:47:33,690 --> 02:47:35,570
Alright, it's fine.

2265
02:47:37,970 --> 02:47:39,390
Oh, okay, that's bad.

2266
02:47:40,790 --> 02:47:42,270
Oh my god, that sucks.

2267
02:47:43,210 --> 02:47:44,590
It's fine, it's fine.

2268
02:47:45,510 --> 02:47:46,270
It's fine.

2269
02:47:50,340 --> 02:47:51,240
It's okay.

2270
02:47:51,540 --> 02:47:52,900
I actually double support up

2271
02:47:58,180 --> 02:48:21,480
I messed up that I didn't I tabbed and I didn't see our mantis have a I didn't see it and then um and he built it so fast I pressed tabbed and he was like 70 I didn't know it was my bad I fucked that up now are all you you kind of I mean, it's pretty fucked right now.

2272
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:25,780
I made sure, too.

2273
02:48:25,840 --> 02:48:27,080
I was gonna be like, I gotta check.

2274
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:32,040
Oh my god.

2275
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:33,960
What the?

2276
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:35,480
What the fuck?

2277
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:37,400
Oh, our guy died so fast.

2278
02:48:43,300 --> 02:48:44,940
I wish I didn't do that.

2279
02:48:51,180 --> 02:48:54,200
This thing is like, oh, I have up before a Mantis.

2280
02:48:54,580 --> 02:48:55,660
I guess I'll up first.

2281
02:48:57,140 --> 02:49:00,720
But yeah, they built it so fucking fast, it threw me off.

2282
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:03,280
That's okay.

2283
02:49:04,040 --> 02:49:06,440
I will redeem myself in this game.

2284
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:11,640
It's okay, we'll fight, we'll be five.

2285
02:49:12,280 --> 02:49:14,200
Look, I just made one mistake.

2286
02:49:16,580 --> 02:49:19,740
It's just one mistake, guys, it's five.

2287
02:49:21,100 --> 02:49:22,840
I meant to kill you, only made the fucking weapon.

2288
02:49:23,360 --> 02:49:25,660
It's okay, we don't have anything else anyway.

2296
02:50:39,690 --> 02:50:42,450
Are you serious?

2297
02:50:47,970 --> 02:50:53,890

2300
02:52:01,050 --> 02:52:01,270
We did.

2301
02:52:01,370 --> 02:52:01,930
They didn't see.

2302
02:52:02,110 --> 02:52:04,090
But I saw what you did.

2303
02:52:04,570 --> 02:52:06,310
I know you fucked up.

2304
02:52:06,750 --> 02:52:08,190
They don't know that.

2305
02:52:08,330 --> 02:52:10,530
But I saw what you did.

2306
02:52:11,070 --> 02:52:11,090
I.

2307
02:52:13,030 --> 02:52:16,370
You made me look bad.

2308
02:52:16,670 --> 02:52:17,950
Because they were like.

2309
02:52:18,170 --> 02:52:19,850
Where's the Luna up.

2310
02:52:20,110 --> 02:52:21,450
But you fuck it.

2311
02:52:21,670 --> 02:52:23,330
You fucked me over.

2312
02:52:23,770 --> 02:52:23,970
You.

2313
02:52:24,510 --> 02:52:26,750
I know your little secret.

2314
02:52:27,090 --> 02:52:28,070
You fuck it.

2315
02:52:28,310 --> 02:52:32,030
He made me look bad in front of everyone.

2316
02:52:33,810 --> 02:52:37,730
But I know he fucked up, but I can't prove it.

2317
02:52:40,030 --> 02:52:42,930
I know what, oh my god, why are we on Loki?

2318
02:52:44,790 --> 02:52:47,650
No, my C was doing so much.

2319
02:52:52,250 --> 02:52:54,130
My C was actually doing so much too.

2320
02:53:02,550 --> 02:53:05,690
It's crazy that we're running Loki in 2025.

2321
02:53:10,970 --> 02:53:13,130
But we ain't fucking killing that guy.

2322
02:53:14,310 --> 02:53:15,130
Oh, we're not even going.

2323
02:53:16,670 --> 02:53:16,950
Oh, big.

2324
02:53:17,890 --> 02:53:19,490
Keep her up, keep her up.

2325
02:53:19,570 --> 02:53:20,670
Oh, we're trying.

2326
02:53:21,070 --> 02:53:22,330
What do we keep her up?

2327
02:53:22,630 --> 02:53:24,030
What else can we do?

2328
02:53:25,350 --> 02:53:25,750
All right.

2329
02:53:26,090 --> 02:53:26,650
Let's just play.

2330
02:53:34,170 --> 02:53:35,210
Oh, no.

2331
02:53:41,270 --> 02:53:41,790
Okay.

2332
02:53:42,110 --> 02:53:42,210
I'm not.

2333
02:53:42,230 --> 02:53:44,410
I mean, they can't- it's winnable!

2334
02:53:45,250 --> 02:53:46,210
I'm making a comeback!

2335
02:53:47,250 --> 02:53:49,670
I mean, 3v5!

2336
02:53:51,250 --> 02:53:51,730
Alright?

2337
02:53:54,210 --> 02:53:55,990
On your toes, here they come!

2338
02:53:57,690 --> 02:53:59,210
This is real!

2339
02:53:59,210 --> 02:54:00,350
Oh, I can't do anything.

2340
02:54:02,190 --> 02:54:03,730
I wish I had my C.

2341
02:54:04,450 --> 02:54:06,430
I wish I had my C right now.

2342
02:54:07,510 --> 02:54:08,450
Can you just rock it at least?

2343
02:54:09,450 --> 02:54:10,550
Okay, I'm getting this.

2344
02:54:10,570 --> 02:54:11,010
You can go first.

2345
02:54:12,230 --> 02:54:13,150
Okay, me first.

2346
02:54:14,090 --> 02:54:14,330
Alright.

2347
02:54:17,970 --> 02:54:18,770
That's unlucky.

2348
02:54:18,930 --> 02:54:21,690
If I had my, I couldn't build all because we went low key.

2349
02:54:22,410 --> 02:54:25,050
So it's even harder to build all now.

2350
02:54:29,690 --> 02:54:31,070
That's the worst part.

2351
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:37,340
I don't care.

2352
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:37,820
I don't care about him, Rose.

2353
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:39,820
He's waiting.

2354
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:42,280
Come on, ma, ma, ma, ma.

2355
02:54:42,560 --> 02:54:43,960
I am ready to put on a shield.

2356
02:54:45,300 --> 02:54:47,960
Okay, we gotta save our Emma.

2357
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:53,380
Oh my god, are you...

2358
02:54:53,380 --> 02:54:54,240
I can't do anything.

2359
02:54:54,440 --> 02:54:55,620
They damage boosted it.

2360
02:54:56,880 --> 02:54:59,160
They just did that damage boost strat.

2361
02:55:00,860 --> 02:55:02,140
I need the fucking...

2362
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:03,040
I need the C.

2363
02:55:04,420 --> 02:55:07,460
Their team's capture progress has passed the halfway point.

2364
02:55:10,750 --> 02:55:12,890
I feel like I should just give it to this guy.

2365
02:55:13,610 --> 02:55:14,130
Our Emma?

2366
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:15,710
Our Emma is...

2367
02:55:15,730 --> 02:55:17,730
He's tanking so much right now.

2368
02:55:22,150 --> 02:55:22,950
Oh, nice.

2369
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:27,790
He said she belongs to me.

2370
02:55:32,070 --> 02:55:33,070
Oh, he wants to raise.

2371
02:55:33,950 --> 02:55:34,210
Born again!

2372
02:55:35,070 --> 02:55:36,530
I'm gonna mantis first, okay?

2373
02:55:39,670 --> 02:55:42,930
Oh my god, oh my god, goodbye.

2374
02:55:43,370 --> 02:55:44,010
Goodbye, everybody.

2375
02:55:44,510 --> 02:55:44,630
Goodbye.

2376
02:55:45,730 --> 02:55:46,210
Goodbye.

2377
02:55:48,550 --> 02:55:49,930
They're both rocking and breaking.

2378
02:55:50,710 --> 02:55:51,470
Break it.

2379
02:55:51,470 --> 02:55:51,750
Break it.

2380
02:55:51,910 --> 02:55:51,950
Break it.

2381
02:55:52,870 --> 02:55:54,110
I'm trying my best.

2382
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:54,630
I'm trying.

2383
02:55:54,710 --> 02:55:55,210
They shielded.

2384
02:55:55,270 --> 02:55:55,830
They shielded.

2385
02:55:58,070 --> 02:55:59,890
I couldn't break it.

2386
02:56:00,710 --> 02:56:01,370
You told me.

2387
02:56:01,510 --> 02:56:02,830
You said to break it.

2388
02:56:03,010 --> 02:56:03,990
I looked back.

2389
02:56:07,410 --> 02:56:10,410
I looked back to break it.

2390
02:56:10,830 --> 02:56:11,410
Why did...

2391
02:56:11,410 --> 02:56:12,750
Okay, it's fine.

2392
02:56:12,990 --> 02:56:13,250
It's fine.

2393
02:56:14,230 --> 02:56:14,570
It's fine.

2394
02:56:14,570 --> 02:56:14,810
It's fine.

2395
02:56:16,270 --> 02:56:17,370
Oh my god, thank you.

2396
02:56:18,970 --> 02:56:19,790
Oh, they're poorly?

2397
02:56:20,290 --> 02:56:20,790
Oh, poorly.

2399
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:36,800
Oh my god.

2400
02:56:36,800 --> 02:56:37,980
I can't do anything.

2401
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:49,620
The Star Lord saw me.

2402
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:50,620
This sucks.

2403
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:53,560
I didn't think he saw me.

2404
02:56:54,520 --> 02:56:55,540
That's so unlucky.

2405
02:56:58,020 --> 02:56:59,840
Yeah, the rocket is getting so much value.

2406
02:57:01,560 --> 02:57:03,140
The Star Lord saw me.

2407
02:57:03,320 --> 02:57:04,660
One of them dies.

02:57:14,400 --> 02:57:15,560

Ha!

2437
03:02:10,140 --> 03:02:13,120
A non-lord raccoon won against... Oh my god.

2438
03:02:13,380 --> 03:02:13,880
Plus 17.

2439
03:02:14,040 --> 03:02:17,300
It's like I might as well just not even play the game.

2440
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:22,400
Like, might as well just not even play it.

2441
03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:24,960
Barely barely anything.

2442
03:02:27,120 --> 03:02:30,320
Only 17 while I was fighting for my life.

2443
03:02:30,680 --> 03:02:31,720
But that's okay.

2444
03:02:31,840 --> 03:02:32,260
Who cares?

2445
03:02:32,280 --> 03:02:37,120
Who cares about what I wouldn't like, you know, who cares about that?

2446
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:51,940
Alright, yay, at least, and I swear, I bet you, if I lost that game, it would have been, like, minus 25 or some shit.

2447
03:02:52,960 --> 03:02:54,780
I could feel it in my bones.

2448
03:02:57,880 --> 03:03:02,380
Alright, I'm thinking, like, how much do I want to stream today?

2449
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:03,340
Hmm.

2450
03:03:05,200 --> 03:03:05,640
Hmm.

2451
03:03:07,140 --> 03:03:08,520
I love energy at the more.

2452
03:03:08,740 --> 03:03:11,300
I do need to sleep before my sponsor tomorrow.

2453
03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:15,960
Oh yeah, I forgot to provide my new emotes that I have.

2454
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:17,260
Hello.

2455
03:03:17,460 --> 03:03:17,580
Whoa.

2456
03:03:18,260 --> 03:03:19,100
That's not it.

2457
03:03:20,580 --> 03:03:21,260
Hello, everybody.

2458
03:03:21,400 --> 03:03:23,020
I'm coming over, guys.

2459
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:23,940
I'm so sad.

2460
03:03:24,060 --> 03:03:25,460
I never got the Emma money.

2461
03:03:25,580 --> 03:03:26,160
Did I get the...

2462
03:03:26,160 --> 03:03:27,380
Yeah, I never got the Emma.

2463
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:29,600
The Emma money emote.

2464
03:03:31,240 --> 03:03:33,260
I've lost potential content.

2465
03:03:33,440 --> 03:03:34,180
Hello, women.

2466
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:36,060
I am also a fellow woman.

2467
03:03:36,900 --> 03:03:37,280
Hello.

2468
03:03:38,740 --> 03:03:40,720
Do you guys have to dance?

2469
03:03:41,240 --> 03:03:41,940

2471
03:03:45,300 --> 03:03:45,840
Come on.

2472
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:47,740
Oh.

2473
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:49,380
Yes.

2474
03:03:50,020 --> 03:03:50,960
Oh my god.

2475
03:03:51,080 --> 03:03:52,040
There we go.

2476
03:03:52,360 --> 03:03:54,080
Get away, fellow women.

2477
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:58,900
That's right.

2478
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:00,660
Make it rain.

2479
03:04:01,460 --> 03:04:04,380
Make it rain for my...

2480
03:04:04,380 --> 03:04:06,700
Oh my god.

2481
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:08,500
Oh my god.

2482
03:04:08,740 --> 03:04:11,400
She knows what she wants.

2483
03:04:11,900 --> 03:04:12,700
Oh, shit!

2484
03:04:13,220 --> 03:04:16,340
Panther was like, no.

2485
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:22,340
You didn't pay for the extra service.

2486
03:04:23,600 --> 03:04:25,180
I love role-playing and rap.

2487
03:04:25,360 --> 03:04:31,560
The moment they add custom lobbies, like the custom customization for lobbies, it's over.

2488
03:04:32,580 --> 03:04:33,620
No gooning allowed.

2489
03:04:33,740 --> 03:04:35,260
Not in my Christian server.

03:05:07,640 --> 03:05:08,340
Oh, shit.

2493

It became a I bet you have custom lobbies or a thing.

2494
03:05:18,580 --> 03:05:20,220
That would be the first thing that's programmed.

Wait, where did she go?

2500
03:05:31,740 --> 03:05:32,920
Wait, she hit from us.

2501
03:05:33,660 --> 03:05:34,380

03:06:10,660 --> 03:06:11,600
Celestial 1.

2504
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:15,460
Oh shit, they have the really good Mantis player.

2505
03:06:18,920 --> 03:06:21,140
Like, gee, that Mantis player was scary.

2506
03:06:21,280 --> 03:06:23,500
I don't think I can fucking do the scene.

2507
03:06:25,780 --> 03:06:26,360
Oh, I don't know.

2508
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,200
Look to your God, he's back.

2509
03:06:33,700 --> 03:06:35,440
They have a torch and a Phoenix player.

2510
03:06:38,420 --> 03:06:39,300
All right.

2511
03:06:40,340 --> 03:06:40,920
Torch time.

2512
03:06:41,980 --> 03:06:43,200
Bro, everybody's duode.

2513
03:06:43,360 --> 03:06:45,240
Everyone I know is duode right now.

2514
03:06:45,400 --> 03:06:46,080
It's not fair.

2515
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:47,860
Why do they have friends?

2516
03:06:48,040 --> 03:06:48,800
It's not...

2517
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:49,620
I don't like it.

2518
03:06:51,800 --> 03:06:55,900
You know, when you're that person, you're like, the last choice.

2519
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:57,800
I hate it.

2520
03:06:58,080 --> 03:06:59,300
I hate these people.

2521
03:07:00,860 --> 03:07:36,410

2525
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:13,640
Because Groot is a fuck.

2526
03:08:14,400 --> 03:08:16,680
Groot in general is a fucking feeder of a tank.

2527
03:08:17,880 --> 03:08:19,500
He's always so hungry for heals.

2528
03:08:19,700 --> 03:08:22,820
He's like, like, you give him a little bit of food, and he's like, that's it.

2529
03:08:24,500 --> 03:08:25,820
We're second dessert.

2530
03:08:26,780 --> 03:08:27,560
Oh, they have Penny?

2531
03:08:29,220 --> 03:08:30,760
How the fuck do they have Penny?

2532
03:08:33,460 --> 03:08:34,840
Oh, that's a bug.

2533
03:08:35,140 --> 03:08:36,320

2534
03:08:36,320 --> 03:08:37,320
Oh, he's doing...

2535
03:08:37,320 --> 03:08:38,040
Oh, my God.

2536
03:08:38,080 --> 03:08:39,060
That's so cheeky.

2537
03:08:39,080 --> 03:08:40,080
He's doing the exploit.

2538
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:43,360
Nerd, you fucking nerd.

2539
03:08:46,840 --> 03:08:50,260
He was trying to do the goddamn Pennyman exploit.

2540
03:08:53,240 --> 03:08:54,780
And he failed.

2541
03:08:55,020 --> 03:08:56,860
That's how much he they wanted their healing.

2542
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:00,420
Where?

2543
03:09:00,680 --> 03:09:02,240

I'm scared so.

2545
03:09:04,060 --> 03:09:07,600
I had to use clap because I was afraid for my fucking lie.

I...

2553
03:10:28,210 --> 03:10:33,850
No, Moon Knight is very easily counterable if we literally have one thing and it's Starlord.

2554
03:10:37,370 --> 03:10:38,870
Like, that's all we need.

2555
03:10:40,770 --> 03:10:42,670
We just need Starlord.

2556
03:10:44,670 --> 03:10:45,290
Fuckers.

2557
03:10:45,410 --> 03:10:50,110
They don't die.

03:10:50,470 --> 03:10:51,310
They just don't die.

2559
03:10:52,810 --> 03:10:53,930
That's so true.

2560
03:10:55,030 --> 03:10:56,210
They really don't.

2561
03:10:56,490 --> 03:10:57,910
They don't die.

2562
03:10:58,610 --> 03:11:00,710
Like, that's crazy.

2563
03:11:01,810 --> 03:11:04,250
It's like triple support is actual help.

2564
03:11:07,410 --> 03:11:08,490
Like, how many...

2565
03:11:08,490 --> 03:11:09,230
Oh my god.

2566
03:11:09,350 --> 03:11:11,130
How many hooks do we need to do?

2567
03:11:12,250 --> 03:11:13,830
Guys, this might be it.

2568
03:11:13,830 --> 03:11:16,330
Guys, I- oh my god.

2569
03:11:28,130 --> 03:11:28,650
Again!

2570
03:11:31,810 --> 03:11:34,030
Hey guys, what about this one guy?

2571
03:11:38,070 --> 03:11:38,870
There you go.

2572
03:11:39,010 --> 03:11:40,090
Let us break this.

2573
03:11:40,450 --> 03:11:42,930
Hey guys, I can't wait to get Moon Knight out of it.

2574
03:11:43,710 --> 03:11:44,230
Again!

2575
03:11:45,430 --> 03:11:46,710
Who has my snowflake?

2576
03:11:46,830 --> 03:11:47,290
Okay, Bucky.

2577
03:11:48,410 --> 03:11:49,470
It's okay guys.

2578
03:11:49,610 --> 03:11:50,550
We got the point.

2579
03:11:50,690 --> 03:11:52,770
I can't wait to get Moon Knight ulted.

2580
03:11:53,230 --> 03:11:54,950
Or like...

2581
03:11:54,950 --> 03:11:57,110
We just can't be grouped up to get there.

2582
03:11:58,930 --> 03:11:59,930
I think that's really it.

2583
03:12:00,370 --> 03:12:01,490
Oh, I thought that was...

2584
03:12:01,490 --> 03:12:03,510
And also that it doesn't help.

2585
03:12:05,210 --> 03:12:06,330
Oh my god, he's so dead.

2586
03:12:06,570 --> 03:12:07,170
He's so dead.

2587
03:12:07,910 --> 03:12:08,390
He's...

2588
03:12:08,390 --> 03:12:09,270
Oh my...

2589
03:12:09,270 --> 03:12:10,530
It's 5 for 5.

2590
03:12:10,570 --> 03:12:12,330
I think the Adam ulted...

2591
03:12:12,330 --> 03:12:15,210
The Adam hook is also building ult so fast for him.

2592
03:12:16,870 --> 03:12:17,350
Nice.

2593
03:12:17,690 --> 03:12:18,010
Nice.

2594
03:12:23,470 --> 03:13:33,010

2595
03:13:36,190 --> 03:13:37,770
No, that's just a...

2596
03:13:37,770 --> 03:13:38,810
That's just a strat.

2597
03:13:40,630 --> 03:13:42,630
It's a strat for...

2598
03:13:45,790 --> 03:13:46,270
Man.

2599
03:13:47,190 --> 03:13:49,030
It just sucks because I went out first.

2600
03:13:49,270 --> 03:13:50,490
So I have to run back.

2601
03:13:51,410 --> 03:13:52,330
I ran...

2602
03:13:52,330 --> 03:13:54,350
I was running back to the...

2603
03:13:54,350 --> 03:13:55,110
To the point.

2604
03:13:55,570 --> 03:13:56,350
And then I got Eden.

2605
03:13:56,470 --> 03:13:57,750
I knew he was going to do it too.

2606
03:13:57,870 --> 03:13:58,510
But I didn't think...

2607
03:13:59,410 --> 03:14:01,470
I didn't think that...

2608
03:14:02,270 --> 03:14:04,230
He was gonna do it that soon.

2609
03:14:08,490 --> 03:14:10,530
I didn't think he was that close to us.

2610
03:14:14,430 --> 03:14:17,790
Alright, I'm just gonna give shield, and then I'll swap off to Luna.

2611
03:14:23,290 --> 03:14:24,610
Samurai, thank you for the hundred biddies.

2612
03:14:24,850 --> 03:14:25,670
Thank you, thank you.

2613
03:14:26,130 --> 03:14:26,770
Keep booking.

2614
03:14:26,950 --> 03:14:28,750
They go to tier one, so they can thank you.

2615
03:14:29,130 --> 03:14:33,670
I'm gonna give shields for everybody before I go.

2616
03:14:34,250 --> 03:15:04,470
or you come the battle starts in five four three two one all right you know if our um if our cloak went in this I think it'd be easier too because um she can build out so fucking fast I'm not even gonna fucking get close to people I don't trust my team a nice deep freeze the life force wants to kill you Oh my god,

2617
03:15:04,570 --> 03:15:06,570
yeah, I mispositioned myself too.

2618
03:15:06,890 --> 03:15:07,750
You hear these guys?

2619
03:15:11,170 --> 03:15:12,650
Oh my god.

2620
03:15:18,150 --> 03:15:19,930
I think he sees me?

2621
03:15:21,950 --> 03:15:22,530
Okay.

2622
03:15:28,730 --> 03:15:30,530
Ow, okay, I'm gonna stay out.

2623
03:15:31,210 --> 03:15:32,090
That's okay.

2624
03:15:32,750 --> 03:15:33,250
Again!

2625
03:15:36,870 --> 03:16:00,810
again okay this is fine this is fine is he still playing moon night yes he is I mean to be fair he was doing fucking absolutely crazy oh my god oh my god oh my god I was playing with fire I needed the extra heals okay the extra ultra I'm like I'm so close

2626
03:16:04,030 --> 03:16:04,470
Okay.

2627
03:16:06,170 --> 03:16:07,390
He definitely had Jeff eat.

2628
03:16:09,510 --> 03:16:10,970
There it is.

2629
03:16:11,730 --> 03:16:11,910
Oh.

2630
03:16:17,370 --> 03:16:18,370
Oh my god.

2631
03:16:21,050 --> 03:16:22,670
I thought he was gonna eat us.

2632
03:16:23,610 --> 03:16:24,290
That was my bad.

2633
03:16:24,370 --> 03:16:25,210
I fucked that up.

2634
03:16:26,190 --> 03:16:28,370
I legitimately thought he was gonna eat us there.

2635
03:16:29,110 --> 03:16:30,310
So I was like, why should I live?

2636
03:16:30,370 --> 03:16:31,630
He's just gonna go, I'm yum yum.

2637
03:16:33,730 --> 03:16:36,850
Like, if he just eats my entire team, there was no point.

2638
03:16:37,150 --> 03:16:38,170
But he didn't.

2639
03:16:38,270 --> 03:16:39,010
Like, I...

2640
03:16:39,010 --> 03:16:41,210
He was playing mine games with me.

2641
03:16:44,970 --> 03:16:47,250
He actually was playing fucking...

2642
03:16:47,250 --> 03:16:48,030
Oh my god.

2643
03:16:48,290 --> 03:16:48,770
Okay, it's fine.

2644
03:16:48,910 --> 03:16:49,270
We live.

2645
03:16:51,610 --> 03:16:52,630
We live there.

2646
03:16:59,300 --> 03:16:59,820
What?

2647
03:16:59,900 --> 03:17:01,240
Our fucking cloak altered?

2648
03:17:01,460 --> 03:17:02,360
I didn't even notice.

2649
03:17:06,740 --> 03:17:07,860
Oh my god.

2650
03:17:09,860 --> 03:17:11,600
Everyone thinks going wrong in this game.

2651
03:17:16,550 --> 03:17:19,670
Everything that could go wrong is going wrong in this game.

2652
03:17:26,650 --> 03:17:27,290
Goodbye.

2653
03:17:28,530 --> 03:17:29,150
Goodbye.

2654
03:17:34,360 --> 03:17:37,320
No, the Jeff ate someone else.

2655
03:17:37,480 --> 03:17:39,320
He didn't eat the...

2656
03:17:40,980 --> 03:17:43,340
Oh my god, everything is going wrong.

2657
03:17:43,460 --> 03:17:44,980
We're double support all thing.

2658
03:17:45,780 --> 03:17:46,420
We're...

2659
03:17:46,420 --> 03:17:49,500
Everything that could go wrong is going wrong, guys.

2660
03:17:49,660 --> 03:17:51,680
I don't know what to do.

2661
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:55,600
This team and me is so uncoordinated.

2662
03:17:56,480 --> 03:17:57,880
We're so uncoordinated.

2663
03:17:58,120 --> 03:17:58,740
I don't know.

2664
03:18:04,560 --> 03:18:05,840
We just...

2665
03:18:05,840 --> 03:18:06,160
Goodbye.

2666
03:18:11,680 --> 03:18:12,960
This team...

2667
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:14,640
I think this team gave up.

2668
03:18:16,740 --> 03:18:18,600
They just have too many combos.

2669
03:18:27,230 --> 03:18:28,030
Okay,

2670
03:18:45,380 --> 03:18:46,040
here we go.

2671
03:18:47,120 --> 03:18:48,980
I'm ready to put on a show.

2672
03:18:49,540 --> 03:18:50,420
Here I go.

2673
03:18:51,240 --> 03:18:51,580
Oh.

2674
03:18:53,440 --> 03:18:54,240
Oh.

2675
03:18:58,040 --> 03:18:58,840
Oh.

2676
03:18:59,280 --> 03:18:59,820
Oh.

2677
03:19:01,100 --> 03:19:01,900
Oh.

2678
03:19:01,900 --> 03:19:02,560
Oh.

2679
03:19:02,560 --> 03:19:03,000
Oh.

2680
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:03,020
Oh.

2681
03:19:03,020 --> 03:19:03,260
Oh.

2682
03:19:06,100 --> 03:19:08,660
Why didn't we ban Jeff?

2683
03:19:09,420 --> 03:19:10,620
Why didn't we...

2684
03:19:11,820 --> 03:19:13,340
It was cooked.

2685
03:19:14,100 --> 03:19:18,180
I truly am the gatekeeper of top 500.

2686
03:19:18,880 --> 03:19:21,080
Yeah, I truly am.

2687
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:26,820
No, it was cooked from the beginning.

2688
03:19:27,760 --> 03:19:29,780
The thing is, I was trying to play...

2689
03:19:29,780 --> 03:19:31,540
I have to play mine games.

2690
03:19:34,720 --> 03:19:39,500
I have to play mind games with their fucking group combo.

2691
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:43,720
That's the thing.

2692
03:19:44,400 --> 03:19:50,080
Like, because if I use Luna ult, I have to worry about...

2693
03:19:50,080 --> 03:19:55,680
I have to worry about the Jeff Eat that can eat my entire team and then make my ult useless.

2694
03:19:56,320 --> 03:20:01,300
Or the Moon Knight ult, if we're in the group ult, which also makes my ult useless.

2695
03:20:03,960 --> 03:20:07,080
didn't do either of that when we got Groot Ulton.

2696
03:20:07,600 --> 03:20:13,600
So my team died because I'm like, I'm like, what?

2697
03:20:16,400 --> 03:20:19,980
Because they did the combo every other time.

2698
03:20:20,540 --> 03:20:21,620
You guys saw that, right?

2699
03:20:21,660 --> 03:20:22,620
They did the E combo.

2700
03:20:23,140 --> 03:20:25,260
They did the, they did the Moonlight combo.

2701
03:20:25,880 --> 03:20:29,800
And then the one time I was like, I might as well just dive my L because you're going to do the combo.

2702
03:20:29,900 --> 03:20:31,220
They didn't do the combo.

2703
03:20:31,880 --> 03:20:36,420
They actually, They're fucking playing with my mind.

2704
03:20:36,880 --> 03:20:38,460
They're playing with me.

2705
03:20:40,700 --> 03:20:44,120
I was like, my adventure is gonna die anyway.

2706
03:20:44,300 --> 03:20:45,140
Are they a cloak player?

2707
03:20:47,540 --> 03:20:48,820
Oh, yeah, they are.

2708
03:20:49,060 --> 03:20:49,900
All right, I'm sorry.

2709
03:20:50,700 --> 03:20:52,620
I cannot have a cloak player on my team.

2710
03:20:52,880 --> 03:20:53,260
I'm sorry.

2711
03:20:53,580 --> 03:20:54,820
I'm gonna avoid low tier God.

2712
03:20:54,980 --> 03:20:56,060
I think this is a side.

2713
03:20:57,120 --> 03:20:57,660
He wasn't.

2714
03:20:57,700 --> 03:20:59,180
I think that's a side.

2715
03:20:59,320 --> 03:21:00,980
I have to avoid low tier God.

2716
03:21:04,320 --> 03:21:36,780
and because i knew that i know if i use it and then i get all combo they're gonna yell at me and but they're gonna yell at me regardless if i don't use up i don't win i never win and that's why we're here today that's why i'm streaming right now because i know i fucking know i like i'm honest i don't my sponsor stream is at 3 p.m tomorrow for the oh it was really nice band i reached out to me to because i the thing is i was Nightmares 3,

2717
03:21:37,080 --> 03:21:37,480
regardless.

2718
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:40,940
If I was sponsored or not.

2719
03:21:41,720 --> 03:21:44,940
So it was really nice that they reached out to me to be like, hey, can we sponsor you to play this game?

2720
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:46,700
I was like, oh, a fucking course, yeah?

2721
03:21:46,900 --> 03:21:48,080
I was going to play it regardless.

2722
03:21:48,580 --> 03:21:49,280
Like, yeah.

2723
03:21:49,680 --> 03:21:55,320
And then they were, like, asking me, like, oh, yeah, they made the third game is co-op.

2724
03:21:56,320 --> 03:21:57,000
It's co-op.

2725
03:21:57,280 --> 03:22:00,580
And then they were asking me if I, if there's anyone I want to do it with.

2726
03:22:00,640 --> 03:22:02,460
And I suggested Shibidoki as well.

2727
03:22:03,320 --> 03:22:08,320
Because, you know, we were I wanted to know the collab someday soon.

2728
03:22:08,560 --> 03:22:09,920
And I was just like, oh, okay.

2729
03:22:10,080 --> 03:22:13,160
Yeah, you know, I'll drop Lin Chibi-Doki for the spot.

2730
03:22:13,260 --> 03:22:14,780
I recommend Chibi-Doki for the sponsor.

2731
03:22:16,880 --> 03:22:18,680
And that's how it came to be.

2732
03:22:20,760 --> 03:22:21,180
Really.

2733
03:22:21,500 --> 03:22:22,860
It's just that easy.

2734
03:22:30,510 --> 03:22:30,770
Mm-hmm.

2735
03:22:31,450 --> 03:22:32,430
I'm not even worried about it.

2736
03:22:34,410 --> 03:22:37,130
I'm just gonna chill out a little bit.

2737
03:22:37,490 --> 03:22:38,890
I want to chill out a little bit.

2738
03:22:39,110 --> 03:22:39,130
Wow.

2739
03:22:39,230 --> 03:22:40,670
I think it's the only issue about...

2740
03:22:42,030 --> 03:22:49,190
Um, oh, but like, I feel like if it's end of season queues, queues should be a lot fucking faster, but it's not.

2741
03:22:49,410 --> 03:22:59,270
It's still slow as hell in this Elo, which is, which doesn't really make much sense because some people are trying to get the font.

2742
03:22:59,370 --> 03:23:03,310
I mean, there's also a lot of people camping it right now, too, I guess.

2743
03:23:04,410 --> 03:23:07,570
All people are, um, camping the rankings.

2744
03:23:08,610 --> 03:23:10,590
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

2745
03:23:15,930 --> 03:23:17,430
So that's why nobody's playing.

2746
03:23:17,610 --> 03:23:19,270
Because if none of the good players are playing.

2747
03:23:19,790 --> 03:23:20,910
Then like, you know.

2748
03:23:22,650 --> 03:23:25,110
If none of the good players are playing.

2749
03:23:25,730 --> 03:23:27,170
Then there's nothing to worry about.

2750
03:23:33,510 --> 03:23:35,850
No, I queue up for all servers.

2751
03:23:36,250 --> 03:23:38,350
For East End, West and Central Coast.

2752
03:23:42,440 --> 03:23:43,840
Yeah, it's pretty easy to camp it.

2753
03:23:43,860 --> 03:23:44,620
Because you don't decay.

2754
03:23:44,860 --> 03:23:45,880
You only decay eternity.

2755
03:23:51,390 --> 03:23:52,630
Now I keep getting the same mag.

2756
03:23:54,550 --> 03:23:57,990
guy this guy was hella last time he was doing so much on hella

2757
03:24:12,750 --> 03:24:27,390
all right let's go emma or bruce banner yes the central coast pick your hero or villain i'm not judging

2758
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:40,100
all right here we go i'm not the type who fades quietly i went from one cloak to another cloak That's okay.

2759
03:24:41,860 --> 03:24:43,240
Oh, okay, that's fine.

2760
03:24:43,600 --> 03:24:44,460
Okay, that's fine.

2761
03:24:45,080 --> 03:24:47,980
If you're not playing Ultron, I'm not playing.

2762
03:24:48,040 --> 03:24:48,920
I'm not playing Luna.

2763
03:24:49,080 --> 03:24:50,000
You can't do this to me.

2764
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:51,020
I left Luna jail.

2765
03:24:51,840 --> 03:24:53,540
I found the key and I broke out.

2766
03:24:53,700 --> 03:24:55,220
You can't put me back in.

2767
03:24:57,400 --> 03:24:58,480
I'm too tired.

2768
03:25:01,320 --> 03:25:03,240
I'm too tired for that shit.

2769
03:25:06,580 --> 03:25:08,120
Who wants to see something fantastic?

2770
03:25:09,060 --> 03:25:11,460
That's a late night session.

2771
03:25:11,760 --> 03:25:13,280
I'm not struggling at all.

2772
03:25:13,620 --> 03:25:14,840
I've been having a great time

2773
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:33,880
You know if I really want to win I would play Luna and then snowflake my magic The battle starts in five

2774
03:25:41,220 --> 03:25:53,320
But also, if Cloak and Dagger really wants to win, she would play Luna and do that so I can stay invisible and win.

2775
03:25:55,340 --> 03:25:56,680
How about Cloak and Dagger?

2776
03:25:57,280 --> 03:25:57,920
Oh my god.

2777
03:25:59,180 --> 03:26:01,120
Are we running triple or are they just playing Jeff?

2778
03:26:01,220 --> 03:26:01,960
Let's fight up.

2779
03:26:04,640 --> 03:26:08,740
I swear to God, if they're on...

2780
03:26:12,660 --> 03:26:22,300
If they are on Cloak and Dagger for their Moon Knight, their Moon Knight does not need their Moon Knight does not need Cloak and Dagger.

2781
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:23,800
He is fine.

2782
03:26:25,100 --> 03:26:26,360
Oh my god they're bay blading.

2783
03:26:27,020 --> 03:26:27,960
Oh they're running triple.

2784
03:26:28,220 --> 03:26:29,340
A fucking Corsair.

2785
03:26:31,640 --> 03:26:36,020
I can't believe this Cloak is playing, playing Cloak for a Moon Knight.

2786
03:26:36,380 --> 03:26:37,300
They have no tank.

2787
03:26:37,860 --> 03:26:38,080
Oh.

2788
03:26:39,060 --> 03:27:05,540

What?

2790
03:27:11,740 --> 03:27:13,720
Why did I have hope?

2791
03:27:14,600 --> 03:27:16,480
Why did our mag push up?

2792
03:27:18,480 --> 03:27:20,180
I had hope for...

2793
03:27:20,920 --> 03:27:24,760
I hope for like three seconds and it was a mistake.

2794
03:27:25,780 --> 03:27:26,200
Never hope.

2795
03:27:27,720 --> 03:27:29,180
Never believe in anything.

2796
03:27:30,760 --> 03:27:31,920
God, do I actually have to...

2797
03:27:31,920 --> 03:27:34,120
Do I actually have to play?

2798
03:27:34,260 --> 03:27:39,700
Our magic is getting, like, destroyed with a...

2799
03:27:39,700 --> 03:27:42,380
Don't mess with the amazing Spider-Man!

2800
03:27:45,320 --> 03:27:45,660
Okay, please.

03:27:47,080 --> 03:27:48,800

I can't do anything!

2825
03:30:18,760 --> 03:30:20,060
Don't even use it.

03:30:20,720 --> 03:30:21,460
I'm coming back.

2827
03:30:22,240 --> 03:30:22,740

Okay, never mind.

2830
03:30:25,300 --> 03:30:26,340
You get TP in these areas.

2831
03:30:26,680 --> 03:30:27,260
That's notes.

2832
03:30:27,960 --> 03:30:28,480
Okay.

2833
03:30:29,260 --> 03:30:30,400

03:30:32,880 --> 03:30:34,060
Okay, I did my best.

2835
03:30:34,220 --> 03:30:35,060
No, I'm good.

2836
03:30:35,060 --> 03:30:35,440

2837
03:30:35,660 --> 03:30:35,860
Yeah.

2838
03:30:37,200 --> 03:30:38,500
Wait, oh he's feeding.

2839
03:30:40,440 --> 03:30:41,160
They're down.

2840
03:30:41,720 --> 03:30:42,780
It's just a hard walk.

2841
03:30:42,860 --> 03:30:43,180
Good stuff.

2842
03:30:43,280 --> 03:30:43,900
We just got to walk.

2843
03:30:44,200 --> 03:30:44,940
Just turn them a walk.

2844
03:30:45,940 --> 03:30:46,180
Hard walk.

2845
03:30:46,260 --> 03:30:46,760
Help support.

2846
03:30:46,960 --> 03:30:48,180
These enemies have nothing.

2847
03:30:53,920 --> 03:30:54,180
Okay.

2848
03:30:54,940 --> 03:30:55,780
Please, please, please, please, please.

2849
03:30:56,400 --> 03:30:56,700
Please!

2850
03:30:57,520 --> 03:30:59,560
Okay, now we don't have any more.

2851
03:31:00,320 --> 03:31:00,440
Yeah.

2852
03:31:01,100 --> 03:31:02,660
Gotta fucking protect the support, bro.

2853
03:31:04,840 --> 03:31:05,500
Let's walk.

2854
03:31:05,660 --> 03:31:06,080
We're gonna touch.

2855
03:31:12,180 --> 03:31:32,660

Oh my god.

2858
03:31:41,960 --> 03:31:42,280
Ah!

2859
03:31:48,640 --> 03:31:51,240
No one cares.

2860
03:31:51,760 --> 03:31:54,340
No one cares about the infest.

2861
03:31:55,900 --> 03:31:56,900
I think they make the hero.

2862
03:31:58,420 --> 03:32:00,280
No one cares!

2863
03:32:01,520 --> 03:32:02,480
No one cares!

2864
03:32:02,940 --> 03:32:07,020
No one cares!

2865
03:32:07,380 --> 03:32:07,700
I...

2866
03:32:07,840 --> 03:32:35,860

2867
03:32:36,040 --> 03:32:37,620
I'd get even less pure.

2868
03:32:38,240 --> 03:32:48,620
Like, the fact that I'm trying my best to slowly walk up to point, and then my diet team actually left me.

2869
03:32:49,340 --> 03:32:50,700
And they're like, this is all.

2870
03:32:50,900 --> 03:32:51,400
Just live.

2871
03:32:51,640 --> 03:32:51,960
Just live.

2872
03:32:52,440 --> 03:32:54,420
I'm like, will you help me live?

2873
03:32:54,740 --> 03:32:56,540
Will you help me stay alive?

2874

Like, I just barely...

2875
03:33:05,620 --> 03:33:06,560
Fairly not!

2876
03:33:08,380 --> 03:33:13,620
You could say it's helping this survive, but you gotta do it too!

2877
03:33:18,100 --> 03:33:19,460
Are you hoping I'm playing?

2878
03:33:20,400 --> 03:33:21,460
Oh man.

2879
03:33:21,720 --> 03:33:22,120
Just go for it.

2880
03:33:22,300 --> 03:33:23,180
I'll go for the area.

2881
03:33:24,900 --> 03:33:25,980
No, we can't go playing.

2882
03:33:29,260 --> 03:33:29,860
Good.

2883
03:33:33,940 --> 03:33:34,400
Good.

Up on point.

2896
03:34:47,620 --> 03:34:48,200

You can't hurt you no more.

2899
03:35:24,940 --> 03:35:26,440
You are nothing.

2900
03:35:32,050 --> 03:35:33,330

2901
03:35:33,570 --> 03:35:33,970

I can't.

2903
03:35:35,130 --> 03:35:35,430
It's time.

2904
03:35:36,090 --> 03:35:36,990
Spider-Man.

2905
03:35:38,130 --> 03:35:38,670
It's time.

2906
03:35:40,850 --> 03:35:42,170
It's the only way.

2907
03:35:42,230 --> 03:35:43,510
I'm so sorry, Cloak.

2908
03:35:43,850 --> 03:35:44,230
It's time.

2909
03:35:44,710 --> 03:35:45,910
Just go Animal Crossing.

2910
03:35:46,870 --> 03:35:47,710
It's the only way.

2911
03:35:48,470 --> 03:35:49,850
It really is.

2912
03:35:53,450 --> 03:35:54,250
It really is.

2913
03:35:54,350 --> 03:35:55,210
It's the only way.

2914
03:35:55,310 --> 03:35:56,590
We have to go.

2915
03:36:00,050 --> 03:36:01,550
It's the only way.

2916
03:36:02,950 --> 03:36:03,890
We have to go.

2917
03:36:04,050 --> 03:36:05,330
He has to go, Jeff.

2918
03:36:06,110 --> 03:36:06,810
That's right.

2919
03:36:10,210 --> 03:36:12,570
If he wants to live, he has to go.

2920
03:36:13,010 --> 03:36:14,150
He has to go, Jeff.

2921
03:36:15,150 --> 03:36:17,870
It's actually the only way to live in this world.

2922
03:36:22,410 --> 03:36:22,870
Okay.

2923
03:36:23,450 --> 03:36:27,180
I'll get you next time.

2924
03:36:28,500 --> 03:36:28,700
Okay.

2925
03:36:32,550 --> 03:36:33,070
Okay.

2926
03:36:34,010 --> 03:36:35,330
See, it's the only way.

2927
03:36:36,170 --> 03:36:37,050
It's the only...

2928
03:36:38,090 --> 03:36:38,610
You're ready.

2929
03:36:38,790 --> 03:36:39,570
We're just staring at it.

2930
03:36:41,190 --> 03:36:42,590
Spider-Man is the only problem though.

2931
03:36:43,430 --> 03:36:44,330
But supports can't walk.

2932
03:36:44,450 --> 03:36:46,450
Spider-Man's kicking on him.

2933
03:36:46,610 --> 03:36:47,730
That's why I said how supports.

2934
03:36:51,150 --> 03:36:51,570
Okay.

2935
03:36:51,890 --> 03:36:53,790
Yeah, but we're saying that, but who's turning?

2936
03:36:54,690 --> 03:36:55,190

2937

Okay, never mind.

You need to.

2942
03:37:41,460 --> 03:37:42,240
Never mind.

2943
03:37:44,680 --> 03:37:46,340
Oh my god.

2944
03:37:46,820 --> 03:37:47,480
Just go Adam.

2945
03:37:47,640 --> 03:37:48,840
We just...

2946
03:37:48,840 --> 03:37:49,780
Just go Adam.

2947
03:37:50,140 --> 03:37:50,920
Just go Jeff.

2948
03:37:52,140 --> 03:37:55,900
Cook so we won't get spied.

2949
03:37:57,040 --> 03:37:57,640
Maybe.

2950
03:37:58,140 --> 03:37:59,100
I don't know.

2951
03:37:59,240 --> 03:37:59,540
I don't know.

2952
03:37:59,680 --> 03:38:00,280
That's a good idea.

2953
03:38:00,760 --> 03:38:01,120
Actually.

2954
03:38:02,940 --> 03:38:03,540
I don't know.

2955
03:38:03,560 --> 03:38:06,340
Are you serious?

2956
03:38:10,580 --> 03:38:19,500
Oh my god, he actually is just He's just following me everywhere Why the fuck did he play Spider-Man when I?

2957
03:38:19,660 --> 03:38:35,100
Oh my god, actual Elytheris There we go Look, the thing is If he doesn't leave me alone If he leaves me alone, he doesn't Just put it here I don't know where else to put it

2958
03:38:41,960 --> 03:39:04,270
I'm sorry are you serious are you serious oh my god I can't go anywhere how does he know oh my god the timing that's actually so fucked for me I can't I can't do anything I'm literally getting timed

2959
03:39:09,010 --> 03:39:10,330
I'm just getting time.

2960
03:39:10,970 --> 03:39:11,670
This is horrible.

2961
03:39:12,770 --> 03:39:13,490
This is miserable.

2962
03:39:14,410 --> 03:39:16,570
I'm having a miserable time right now.

2963
03:39:17,390 --> 03:39:17,930
Oh my god.

2964
03:39:18,110 --> 03:39:19,550
I did not deserve this Elo.

2965
03:39:20,150 --> 03:39:25,190
I did not deserve this Elo.

2966
03:39:25,930 --> 03:39:29,710
I mean, that cloak was getting touched 24-7.

2967
03:39:30,210 --> 03:39:33,050
And we both were just our only help.

2968
03:39:33,130 --> 03:39:33,870
I don't even know.

2969
03:39:33,990 --> 03:39:34,850
I don't even know how we went.

2970
03:39:34,970 --> 03:39:36,090
I did not deserve that Elo.

2971
03:39:36,650 --> 03:39:38,990
I swear I was dying like 80%.

2972
03:39:39,010 --> 03:40:12,270
percent of time and i couldn't do anything about it i i couldn't do i felt like i had no backup at all i did not get helped at all that entire time i literally went raccoon so at least like at least my cloak had a better chance of surviving i there was zero feel i swear to god We had zero feel for the backline.

2973
03:40:12,670 --> 03:40:13,590
It was me and Cloak.

2974
03:40:14,110 --> 03:40:19,930
And the moment I swapped off from Invis, like, the body was just like, you.

2975
03:40:20,430 --> 03:40:22,070
I kill you now.

2976
03:40:24,230 --> 03:40:26,770
He's like, I don't care about the Cloak.

2977
03:40:27,390 --> 03:40:28,870
You're the problem now.

2978
03:40:28,890 --> 03:40:30,390
And I'm like, what did I do?

2979
03:40:33,190 --> 03:40:34,270
You're already getting...

2980
03:40:34,270 --> 03:40:34,710
That's it.

2981
03:40:34,790 --> 03:40:37,210
I need to know how close are you to top 500.

2982
03:40:39,010 --> 03:40:39,750
on you.

2983
03:40:41,850 --> 03:40:42,590
That's right.

2984
03:40:43,170 --> 03:40:44,110
The curse of Ra.

2985
03:40:44,790 --> 03:40:48,230
You're not getting top 500 tonight in this 24-hour grind.

2986
03:40:48,570 --> 03:40:49,850
As long as I'm queuing.

2987
03:40:50,430 --> 03:40:57,490
As long as I'm queuing, you're not making it in 24 hours.

2988
03:40:57,970 --> 03:41:00,210
TikTok, you have 22 hours left.

2989
03:41:06,610 --> 03:41:07,310
Evil.

2990
03:41:08,590 --> 03:41:12,470
The longer I queue, the longer less likely you're gonna get it.

2991
03:41:18,560 --> 03:41:19,580
That's fucking right.

2992
03:41:27,420 --> 03:41:29,280
You've been playing the whole night.

2993
03:41:29,800 --> 03:41:30,500
I've seen you.

2994
03:41:30,700 --> 03:41:34,340
I've bumped into this person so many times in the late night queues.

2995
03:41:34,700 --> 03:41:36,440
You ain't getting it, buddy.

2996
03:41:39,480 --> 03:41:48,290
It was the last thing I do before I go this trip it's denying your joy

2997
03:41:53,590 --> 03:41:59,040
that's the one thing i will do before before i leave

2998
03:42:10,050 --> 03:42:11,930
all right

2999
03:42:20,860 --> 03:42:31,140
whoa well if they if they what if they what if they what If they...

3000
03:42:31,920 --> 03:42:32,440
Bro.

3001
03:42:35,660 --> 03:42:36,260
If they what?

3002
03:42:36,640 --> 03:42:37,780
We'll never know.

3003
03:42:40,460 --> 03:42:42,840
Oh my god, we have two penny players.

3004
03:42:43,240 --> 03:42:44,200
How did life...

3005
03:42:44,200 --> 03:42:45,840
How did life get this way?

3006
03:42:46,280 --> 03:42:48,120
How do we get two penny players?

3007
03:42:48,780 --> 03:42:50,200
Yo, what's up with Shiko?

3008
03:42:51,120 --> 03:42:51,620
What's up, man?

3009
03:42:51,760 --> 03:42:52,280
How's your day then?

3010
03:42:53,680 --> 03:42:54,540
Uh, you know what?

3011
03:42:54,920 --> 03:42:55,420
Pretty bad.

3012
03:42:56,280 --> 03:42:57,380
I'm sorry about that.

3013
03:42:59,980 --> 03:43:00,620
That's good.

3014
03:43:01,380 --> 03:43:02,740
We're making our way back up.

3015
03:43:04,860 --> 03:43:06,440
I just have the craziest game ever.

3016
03:43:06,940 --> 03:43:07,380
It was wild.

3017
03:43:08,200 --> 03:43:09,540
I just had a game of crimson.

3018
03:43:09,840 --> 03:43:12,260
Um, Ben Thor, if they're going to bend 20, we're going to bend 20.

3019
03:43:12,680 --> 03:43:13,900
I'm sorry about that.

3020
03:43:14,700 --> 03:43:16,300
Well, never, they got him.

3021
03:43:16,860 --> 03:43:19,380
The ELO assassins got him.

3022
03:43:19,940 --> 03:43:24,740
So if they're going to ban our, they're going to bend Penny as well, but...

3023
03:43:24,740 --> 03:43:26,400
Surely we don't leave like Torch over.

3024
03:43:27,840 --> 03:43:28,720
I mean...

3025
03:43:29,380 --> 03:43:30,440
You could play Torch.

3026
03:43:31,980 --> 03:43:33,280
I could play BP.

3027
03:43:38,020 --> 03:43:38,520
Oh.

3028
03:43:38,520 --> 03:43:40,300
You really should have read through his doors.

3029
03:43:40,560 --> 03:43:41,680
Like he's really bad.

3030
03:43:44,480 --> 03:43:48,160
Guys, what happened to our Torch fan, guys?

3031
03:43:48,520 --> 03:43:50,020
I mean, he's worse on everything else.

3032
03:43:50,320 --> 03:43:54,200
Guys, what happened to our Torch fan, everybody?

3033
03:43:55,160 --> 03:43:56,740
I thought we had...

3034
03:43:56,740 --> 03:43:59,000
I thought we...

3035
03:43:59,000 --> 03:43:59,360
Okay.

3036
03:44:02,360 --> 03:44:31,720
I thought we had an agreement No apparently There's Red Thills on the enemy team And he's like the most He is like a notorious Thor one trick That everyone hates I've also had my share of Red Thills was the Is he OG Evo terrorist He's been terrorizing even Like whenever he started playing Rival But yeah,

3037
03:44:33,120 --> 03:44:34,340
because he does not swap.

3038
03:44:34,580 --> 03:44:37,300
I think he has learned to recently swap to Thor.

3039
03:44:37,960 --> 03:44:38,980
Swap off of Thor.

3040
03:44:39,560 --> 03:44:43,080
But he was like a hardcore Thor one trick for the longest fucking time.

3041
03:44:43,520 --> 03:44:45,080
And I was not happy.

3042
03:44:45,200 --> 03:44:52,060
Whenever I get him on my team, when he would not never swap, it made me very, very depressed.

3043
03:44:52,340 --> 03:44:53,180
What about second?

3044
03:44:53,480 --> 03:44:54,460
Two, one.

3045
03:44:54,740 --> 03:44:55,840
It's like he's on Neckros, bro.

3046
03:44:57,580 --> 03:44:58,460
What about that?

3047
03:44:58,640 --> 03:44:59,180
What about that?

3048
03:44:59,740 --> 03:45:01,440
Nope, just like you're dealing with that guy.

3049
03:45:02,080 --> 03:45:02,360
Alright.

3050
03:45:04,240 --> 03:45:06,840
The fight is not even close to the club.

3051
03:45:07,000 --> 03:45:07,760
Where is Nat?

3052
03:45:08,140 --> 03:45:09,020
Guys, did we just...

3053
03:45:09,020 --> 03:45:10,280
Wait, where did the... What?

3054
03:45:11,480 --> 03:45:12,940
Wow, our mag is already good.

3055
03:45:14,960 --> 03:45:15,240
Ah.

3056
03:45:21,360 --> 03:45:21,840
Okay.

3057
03:45:25,510 --> 03:45:26,190
I missed.

3058
03:45:26,290 --> 03:45:26,570
Not bad.

3059
03:45:26,810 --> 03:45:27,830
Alright, that's fine.

3060
03:45:28,690 --> 03:45:29,170
Alright, get ready.

3061
03:45:29,950 --> 03:45:30,650
Bubble, bubble.

It was nice knowing you.

3065
03:46:04,670 --> 03:46:07,790
It was nice knowing you guys.

3066
03:46:08,710 --> 03:46:11,050
I have to use my healer sprint.

3067
03:46:12,970 --> 03:46:15,270
What the fuck is going on?

3068
03:46:15,930 --> 03:46:17,570
Oh my god.

3069
03:46:19,190 --> 03:46:20,530
We gotta go.

3070
03:46:21,630 --> 03:46:22,270
Alright, here we go.

3071
03:46:24,170 --> 03:46:26,090
Jesus, what's going on?

3072
03:46:26,690 --> 03:46:29,570
What the fuck is going on in my team?

3073
03:46:29,670 --> 03:46:30,990
I'm losing track of everything.

3078
03:47:08,610 --> 03:47:09,010
I needed that.

3079
03:47:09,130 --> 03:47:10,430
I need my own heal.

3080
03:47:14,890 --> 03:47:15,950
That's fine.

3081
03:47:17,370 --> 03:47:18,150

03:47:26,850 --> 03:47:29,490
Don't worry, would you want double damage boost?

3088
03:47:29,790 --> 03:47:30,030
Just a deathly die.

3089
03:47:31,790 --> 03:47:35,350
Double damage boost more damage boost.

3090
03:47:35,870 --> 03:47:38,730
Did you save even more damage boost?

3091
03:47:40,310 --> 03:47:44,550

3092
03:47:45,870 --> 03:47:46,770
Oh my god, that's too much.

3093
03:47:47,050 --> 03:47:47,390
That's too much.

3094
03:47:47,550 --> 03:47:47,930

3095
03:47:48,290 --> 03:47:48,790

3098
03:48:06,850 --> 03:48:07,630
It's not fine.

3099
03:48:09,390 --> 03:48:10,970
I'm coming back now though.

3100
03:48:11,010 --> 03:48:11,850
You have no healers.

3101
03:48:12,610 --> 03:48:13,630
Try ultes or not.

3102
03:48:13,950 --> 03:48:15,770

There he fucking, there he goes.

3108
03:48:27,870 --> 03:48:29,890
I just thought they had to lift all of them really low.

3109
03:48:31,510 --> 03:48:32,310
I'm on carpet though.

3110
03:48:32,690 --> 03:48:33,130
That's a good buddy.

3111
03:48:33,230 --> 03:48:34,350
That's a good buddy.

3112
03:48:34,530 --> 03:48:35,010
Thank you.

3113
03:48:35,170 --> 03:48:35,770
Thank you.

3114
03:48:35,870 --> 03:48:37,030
You know what?

3115
03:48:37,310 --> 03:48:38,370
I think...

3116
03:48:38,370 --> 03:48:38,870
I got Emma?

3117
03:48:39,150 --> 03:48:39,390
Oh, I...

3118
03:48:39,390 --> 03:48:40,350
Alright, let's go.

3119
03:48:40,450 --> 03:48:40,930
Nice job.

3120
03:48:41,170 --> 03:48:41,470
Yeah, alright.

3121
03:48:41,470 --> 03:48:41,850
We can kill it.

3122
03:48:41,950 --> 03:48:42,670
We can kill it.

3123
03:48:43,530 --> 03:48:44,090
Let's go!

3124
03:48:44,610 --> 03:48:46,370
I've been- I pumped so many leaves.

3125
03:48:46,450 --> 03:48:48,110
I don't even know how- who doesn't have leaves.

3126
03:48:50,110 --> 03:48:53,050
I pumped so many leaves, I don't- Oh shit!

3127
03:48:54,710 --> 03:48:55,370
That's alright.

3128
03:48:55,750 --> 03:48:56,750
It was a good push.

3129
03:48:57,150 --> 03:48:58,150
It was a good effort.

3130
03:48:58,770 --> 03:49:00,730
It was a good effort.

3131
03:49:00,750 --> 03:49:01,230
I'm on point.

3132
03:49:02,690 --> 03:49:03,710
I don't know what's going.

3133
03:49:03,910 --> 03:49:05,770
Whenever I play Mantis, I swear to God.

3134
03:49:05,990 --> 03:49:10,930
I feel like everything is just, like I don't even know what's going on.

3135
03:49:18,090 --> 03:49:20,450
I pull Emma and she has no diamond for him?

3136
03:49:20,510 --> 03:49:20,930
Emma, can I?

3137
03:49:21,550 --> 03:49:22,270
Oh my god.

3138
03:49:24,490 --> 03:49:27,090
Wait, I slept something?

3139
03:49:27,590 --> 03:49:28,570
What did I do?

3140
03:49:29,650 --> 03:49:31,570
Oh, I slept her.

3141
03:49:31,570 --> 03:49:34,150
It didn't matter.

3142
03:49:34,290 --> 03:49:35,450
I still died.

3143
03:49:35,990 --> 03:49:39,930
It didn't matter They're like nice leave.

3144
03:49:40,150 --> 03:49:41,550
I don't know what was going on.

3145
03:49:43,250 --> 03:49:45,610
I don't know what's going on.

3146
03:49:45,610 --> 03:49:54,550
That's They're like well, that must have been planned wasn't it?

3147
03:49:54,710 --> 03:49:56,370
I'm like Yeah

3148
03:50:01,570 --> 03:50:02,150
He got that one.

3149
03:50:02,210 --> 03:50:03,090
He got that one.

3150
03:50:03,210 --> 03:50:03,870
He got that one.

3151
03:50:03,870 --> 03:50:04,550
I'm somebody.

3152
03:50:04,550 --> 03:50:05,790
Give me my shooter armor, bro.

3153
03:50:06,390 --> 03:50:06,990
No, we're in one.

3154
03:50:07,170 --> 03:50:07,210
We're in one.

3155
03:50:07,370 --> 03:50:07,470
We're in one, please.

3156
03:50:08,670 --> 03:50:09,260
I'm a one.

3157
03:50:10,250 --> 03:50:10,590
I'm somebody.

3158
03:50:10,950 --> 03:50:11,530
I'm just one.

3159
03:50:11,630 --> 03:50:12,090
Damage boost.

3160
03:50:14,210 --> 03:50:15,810
What do you mean?

3161
03:50:16,270 --> 03:50:17,210
I'm someone.

3162
03:50:18,950 --> 03:50:20,410
They got nobody.

3163
03:50:22,970 --> 03:50:26,390
I think I deserve to be acknowledged.

3164
03:50:27,730 --> 03:50:29,430
It's because I'm anime, isn't it?

3165
03:50:29,850 --> 03:50:30,530
I'm going to farm out.

3166
03:50:31,750 --> 03:50:33,570
This is your big chance!

3167
03:50:34,570 --> 03:50:34,890
No!

3168
03:50:35,350 --> 03:50:38,630
I just made it!

3169
03:50:39,410 --> 03:50:40,470
Better Moon Knight alting.

3170
03:50:42,270 --> 03:50:43,890
It's because I'm adamant, isn't it?

3171
03:50:43,970 --> 03:50:44,910
I got three, I got three!

3172
03:50:47,830 --> 03:50:48,950
I'm on Moon Knight, Moon Knight, can I?

3173
03:50:49,050 --> 03:50:51,350
Moon Knight solo, Moon Knight solo, nice.

3174
03:50:52,730 --> 03:50:54,670
Mag on point, Mag on point in our back line.

3175
03:50:55,210 --> 03:50:56,030
Oh my god.

3176
03:50:57,150 --> 03:50:57,930
Mag's one, Mag's one!

3177
03:50:59,510 --> 03:51:00,350

3181
03:51:06,550 --> 03:51:07,790
How are we...

3182
03:51:08,410 --> 03:51:09,570
How are we stuck?

3183
03:51:09,730 --> 03:51:12,270
Oh my god, I even ulted!

3184
03:51:12,670 --> 03:51:13,890
Backing all of those over there.

3185
03:51:14,910 --> 03:51:19,150
We were fucking beating the shit out of their healers for so long!

3186
03:51:23,910 --> 03:51:24,470
I don't know.

3187
03:51:25,890 --> 03:51:26,790
Oh, they wasted it.

3188
03:51:27,010 --> 03:51:27,490

3251
03:56:20,910 --> 03:56:21,390

3253
03:56:25,420 --> 03:56:25,760

3254
03:56:26,280 --> 03:56:26,780

3255
03:56:26,980 --> 03:56:27,420

3256
03:56:27,540 --> 03:56:28,020

3257
03:56:28,960 --> 03:56:29,520
Oh no.

3258
03:56:30,200 --> 03:56:31,240
He got all of us.

3259
03:56:31,440 --> 03:56:32,040
Oh no.

3260
03:56:32,480 --> 03:56:33,080
Wait, two.

3261
03:56:34,500 --> 03:56:35,540
I can stall for you.

3262
03:56:36,220 --> 03:56:37,520
That was so unlucky.

3263
03:56:41,620 --> 03:56:42,860
I'm falling as long as I can.

3264
03:56:44,040 --> 03:56:45,700

3272
03:57:52,090 --> 03:57:53,170
Yeah, it's clear we got you.

3273
03:57:53,950 --> 03:57:54,770
Because I want to fight.

3274
03:57:55,270 --> 03:57:56,590
I'll try and force Simon for him early.

3275

I can force here.

3276
03:57:59,110 --> 03:58:01,130
I'm just going further away.

3277
03:58:01,650 --> 03:58:05,470
I don't want to play too far because you're not supposed to play far.

3278
03:58:06,410 --> 03:58:09,850
But, like, I'm literally getting farmed so hard right now.

3279
03:58:14,030 --> 03:58:15,150
I thought I had drones on me.

3280
03:58:17,670 --> 03:58:18,550
Jesus Christ.

3281
03:58:19,430 --> 03:58:20,230
Oh, okay.

3282
03:58:20,990 --> 03:58:21,390

3283
03:58:24,290 --> 03:58:24,990
Hello, goodbye.

3284
03:58:25,550 --> 03:58:25,730
Goodbye.

3285
03:58:26,090 --> 03:58:26,830
Are you serious?

3286
03:58:27,410 --> 03:58:28,830
What can I do?

3287
03:58:29,050 --> 03:58:30,690
Emma all got me down to the ground.

3288
03:58:32,950 --> 03:58:33,690
I'm fine point though.

3289
03:58:33,770 --> 03:58:34,230
We're challenged.

3290
03:58:34,630 --> 03:58:36,110
What can I do?

3291
03:58:38,250 --> 03:58:39,590
We got another fight here.

3292
03:58:40,050 --> 03:58:41,610
I have my ult for this next fight as well.

3293
03:58:41,750 --> 03:58:44,010
We can combo me and you, Swinny, or me and Fu.

3294
03:58:44,170 --> 03:58:44,670
It's up to you guys.

3295
03:58:45,030 --> 03:58:45,610
Yeah, I've got both.

3296
03:58:46,550 --> 03:58:47,150
I'll use my ult.

3297
03:58:47,510 --> 03:58:47,870
Okay.

3298
03:58:49,330 --> 03:58:51,350
I don't know what to do.

3299
03:58:51,350 --> 03:58:52,310
I don't know what to do.

3300
03:58:52,530 --> 03:58:53,330
All right, let me know if you guys are ready.

3301

3304
03:59:02,610 --> 03:59:02,970
Okay.

3305
03:59:05,730 --> 03:59:08,950
Dude, this moon knight is just getting so much value because the knight is going to break out.

3306
03:59:09,030 --> 03:59:09,170

3307
03:59:11,070 --> 03:59:11,790
Oh, no.

3308
03:59:12,130 --> 03:59:13,370
Please, please, please, please, man.

3309
03:59:13,510 --> 03:59:15,970
Like, I'm pretending I'm fucking fighting for so long.

Oh my god, it's not fine.

3359

Jesus Christ.

Who cares what I want?

3365
04:02:49,860 --> 04:02:51,620
Can I go back here now?

3366
04:02:52,860 --> 04:02:54,420
What if I just heal here?

3367
04:02:56,860 --> 04:02:57,260
It's bad.

3368
04:02:58,140 --> 04:02:58,520
It's okay.

3369
04:02:59,120 --> 04:03:00,000
I still have this.

3370
04:03:00,660 --> 04:03:01,640
I still have this.

3371
04:03:02,140 --> 04:03:03,400

3372
04:03:03,840 --> 04:03:04,960

3373
04:03:08,590 --> 04:03:09,830

3375
04:03:11,690 --> 04:03:13,990
I... I still have this.

3376
04:03:14,810 --> 04:03:16,330
Oh my god.

3377
04:03:17,630 --> 04:03:18,170
Okay.

3378
04:03:22,330 --> 04:03:24,330
This game also sucked.

3379
04:03:25,030 --> 04:03:28,590
This game also fucking sucked.

3380
04:03:30,790 --> 04:03:35,990
I swear I'm getting pummeled to the ground and being like...

3381
04:03:36,790 --> 04:03:38,730
Are you enjoying this?

3382
04:03:39,090 --> 04:03:40,970
I'm like, no.

3383
04:03:45,930 --> 04:03:47,970
They're like, come on.

3384
04:03:49,470 --> 04:03:51,130
Aren't you having fun?

3385
04:03:51,730 --> 04:03:52,550
Oh, hey.

3386
04:03:53,230 --> 04:03:53,850
This is rough.

3387
04:03:56,830 --> 04:03:59,030
Wait, this is the Korean guy.

3388
04:03:59,370 --> 04:04:00,770
Oh, isn't this the...

3389
04:04:00,770 --> 04:04:01,850
I'm this player?

3390
04:04:03,030 --> 04:04:03,370
Hello.

3391
04:04:06,190 --> 04:04:08,290

And I get plus, bro.

3394
04:04:11,530 --> 04:04:25,370
No, I get plus 17 because of the fact that, um, because of the fact that, uh, uh, I died 14 times.

3395
04:04:25,830 --> 04:04:31,310
I, I fucking died 14 times in a row.

3396
04:04:32,130 --> 04:04:34,350
Yeah, this is the Korean Iron Fist player.

3397
04:04:34,690 --> 04:04:35,630
Yeah, is it Rocky OTP?

3398
04:04:35,850 --> 04:04:38,410

3401
04:07:21,470 --> 04:07:22,410
I lose a lot.

3402
04:07:23,370 --> 04:07:24,410
I'm just saying.

3403
04:07:24,910 --> 04:07:26,730
I would lose a lot.

3404
04:07:27,670 --> 04:07:30,750
So, Rocket better be carrying me.

3405
04:07:32,830 --> 04:07:35,850
I better see a carry of a lifetime.

3406
04:07:36,310 --> 04:07:37,490
Because he's on an alt account.

3407
04:07:37,570 --> 04:07:38,510
I know that's your alt.

3408
04:07:39,110 --> 04:07:39,710

3409
04:07:39,710 --> 04:07:40,130
I...

3410
04:07:40,130 --> 04:07:41,790

04:07:45,410 --> 04:07:47,570
Thank you for their tier...

3412
04:07:47,570 --> 04:07:49,310

3414
04:08:15,890 --> 04:08:20,630
well i'm the gatekeeper i'm here to make sure people don't get top 500.

3415
04:08:30,820 --> 04:08:44,180
I mean, if I win four games in a row, which is like in Dreamland, like, if there was a utopia where everyone's dreams come true.

3416
04:08:44,200 --> 04:08:45,040
We could.

3417
04:08:48,800 --> 04:08:51,820
Or everyone's dreams can actually come true.

3418
04:08:52,200 --> 04:08:53,320
That would be the day.

3419
04:08:54,920 --> 04:08:55,900
And then world peace.

3420
04:08:56,040 --> 04:09:01,000
If I ever win, if I win four games in a row, World peace will fully be established.

3421
04:09:01,560 --> 04:09:03,120
That means world peace is possible.

3422
04:09:03,540 --> 04:09:04,860
We will fix...

3423
04:09:04,860 --> 04:09:07,340
We'll fix world hunger.

3424
04:09:07,760 --> 04:09:09,460
No one will ever be hungry again.

3425
04:09:09,920 --> 04:09:10,680
No more poor.

3426
04:09:10,880 --> 04:09:12,280
No more homeless people.

3427
04:09:13,200 --> 04:09:15,000
That's when I win four games in a row.

3428
04:09:15,900 --> 04:09:17,700
The day I win four games in a row.

3429
04:09:21,640 --> 04:09:23,100
But that ain't happening.

3430
04:09:23,680 --> 04:09:25,780
The cancer will be cured.

3431
04:09:26,100 --> 04:09:26,300
Yeah.

3432
04:09:26,840 --> 04:09:35,740
If I win four games in a row, and secure top 500 right now we have cancer will be cured.

3433
04:09:39,540 --> 04:09:40,940
I'm not hoping.

3434
04:09:41,240 --> 04:09:41,800
That's the thing.

3435
04:09:42,160 --> 04:09:43,520
There's no hope anymore.

3436
04:09:44,680 --> 04:09:45,600

That's actually I still can't believe he said that

3501

I still can't believe he said that I'm like processing the fact that my life has no value I'm grabbing you My life has no value to them.

3502
04:15:02,070 --> 04:15:03,900
I'm going to try to pin them.

3503
04:15:05,630 --> 04:15:06,110

Nice, nice, nice.

3511
04:15:16,850 --> 04:15:20,970
The only thing that has value is those ray grids.

3512
04:15:21,970 --> 04:15:24,050
So it's like no voice in.

04:33:28,940 --> 04:33:31,360
It feels good to step outside my bubble every now and then.

3759
04:33:31,420 --> 04:33:32,660
All right, here you go.

3760
04:33:32,980 --> 04:33:33,140
Oh.

3761
04:33:34,540 --> 04:33:35,920
I realize what time it is.

3762
04:33:36,160 --> 04:33:37,440
30 seconds before you attack.

3763
04:33:37,780 --> 04:33:38,240
Get ready.

3764
04:33:38,980 --> 04:33:39,340
All right.

3765
04:33:44,290 --> 04:33:45,590
Maybe that was...

3766
04:33:45,590 --> 04:33:47,890
Maybe I should have just streamed my top island route.

3767
04:33:48,310 --> 04:33:49,250
Maybe I should have just streamed.

3768
04:33:49,250 --> 04:33:52,690
Maybe if I streamed my grind, things would have been easier.

3769
04:33:52,710 --> 04:33:58,620
I think I actually would have hit top 500 if I streamed my grind

3770
04:34:04,650 --> 04:34:11,710
The beachy mode Oh the beach ball Alright What the fuck?

3771
04:34:12,070 --> 04:34:24,370
Oh my god Okay I should have I should have picked Actually no Oh I don't know who to heal.

3772
04:34:26,410 --> 04:34:28,230
Like, who...

3773
04:34:28,230 --> 04:34:30,590
Who do we heal in this?

3774
04:34:32,510 --> 04:34:34,650
Oh my god, oh my god.

3775
04:34:35,050 --> 04:34:35,570
Like, me hit!

3776
04:34:35,950 --> 04:34:36,930
I feel like...

3777
04:34:37,510 --> 04:34:39,670
Okay, maybe I should flip.

3778
04:34:40,150 --> 04:34:40,710
Oh my...

3779
04:34:43,370 --> 04:34:44,550
Like, who...

3780
04:34:44,550 --> 04:34:45,630
Who am I healing?

3781
04:34:55,000 --> 04:34:56,080
Bro, I...

3782
04:34:56,440 --> 04:34:57,240
I... I...

3783
04:34:58,260 --> 04:34:59,580
I don't know.

3784
04:35:00,600 --> 04:35:02,120
I'm not playing this.

3785
04:35:02,660 --> 04:35:04,460
I feel like I can't heal anybody.

3786
04:35:07,540 --> 04:35:10,240
I'm like, who do I heal like in this scenario?

3787
04:35:13,080 --> 04:35:16,880
Like I have to everybody is like fucking flying everywhere.

3788
04:35:22,680 --> 04:35:23,620
I swear to God.

3789
04:35:24,500 --> 04:35:26,440
There was like nobody to look at.

3790
04:35:31,250 --> 04:35:35,550
Yeah, um, Yeah, that ain't happening, I guess.

3791
04:35:39,290 --> 04:35:40,410
Or do I go Mantis?

3792
04:35:40,570 --> 04:35:41,770
I don't know, actually.

3793
04:35:42,130 --> 04:35:43,590
I feel like if I go...

3794
04:35:43,590 --> 04:35:43,870
Wait.

3795
04:35:46,810 --> 04:35:47,630
That's unlucky.

3796
04:35:48,530 --> 04:35:50,010
I went to Triumph here.

3797
04:35:52,990 --> 04:35:54,010
He did it!

3798
04:35:55,470 --> 04:35:56,350
What the fuck?

3799
04:35:57,910 --> 04:35:59,390
That's not on...

3800
04:35:59,390 --> 04:35:59,430
Oh!

3801
04:36:04,030 --> 04:36:05,450
Good fight.

3802
04:36:07,670 --> 04:36:08,970
Good fight.

3803
04:36:11,230 --> 04:36:11,530
Alright.

3804
04:36:12,930 --> 04:36:13,690
That's fine.

3805
04:36:14,490 --> 04:36:15,030
It's okay.

3806
04:36:16,430 --> 04:36:18,130
It's not, but it's okay.

3807
04:36:19,610 --> 04:36:22,270
I had a feeling this was gonna happen.

3808
04:36:22,470 --> 04:36:23,010
It's okay.

3809
04:36:27,410 --> 04:36:27,790
Alright.

3810
04:36:28,870 --> 04:36:29,930
Solo tank.

3811
04:36:31,110 --> 04:36:32,470
Solo tank.

3812
04:36:34,170 --> 04:36:35,790
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

3813
04:36:36,230 --> 04:36:37,290
I'm sorry, bro.

3814
04:36:48,920 --> 04:36:49,860
Will we be okay?

3815
04:36:52,760 --> 04:36:53,540
But...

3816
04:36:53,540 --> 04:36:54,960
Will we be okay, guys?

3817
04:36:55,200 --> 04:36:56,660
Oh my god!

3818
04:36:59,160 --> 04:37:01,100
I don't think so.

3819
04:37:01,840 --> 04:37:02,440
I...

3820
04:37:02,440 --> 04:37:05,200
I don't think so.

3821
04:37:11,010 --> 04:37:12,370
okay it's fine

3822
04:37:16,330 --> 04:37:20,750

3823
04:37:24,780 --> 04:37:45,200

3824
04:37:49,070 --> 04:37:51,410
These are the games that we are playing, guys.

3825
04:37:55,110 --> 04:37:57,710
This cursed ass top 500.

3826
04:38:05,210 --> 04:38:06,310
Okay, that's fine.

3827
04:38:10,600 --> 04:38:16,820
The fact that these are how games are like, this does not look high, Elo.

3828
04:38:17,160 --> 04:38:19,060
I don't feel like I'm playing.

3829
04:38:19,080 --> 04:38:20,060
Hi, Elo.

3830
04:38:24,520 --> 04:38:27,780
Oh yeah, apparently he's like one of the best Iron Fist players in the world.

3831
04:38:29,540 --> 04:38:31,840
He just likes the, he just likes the pun.

3832
04:38:35,040 --> 04:38:37,840
Oh my god, I'm fucking leaving.

3833
04:38:41,660 --> 04:38:42,380
My art.

3834
04:38:46,780 --> 04:38:47,960
Oh my god, he's five.

3835
04:38:56,180 --> 04:39:02,040
Um, we double support ulted, so I'm a little concerned.

3836
04:39:07,150 --> 04:39:10,070
Okay, we double support ulted, so I really have to build up right now.

3837
04:39:10,730 --> 04:39:12,590
I need to build up right now.

3838
04:39:15,720 --> 04:39:17,440
This is really bad.

3839
04:39:17,760 --> 04:39:21,320
Like, I need all, like, right now, because Spy Man has all...

3840
04:39:21,320 --> 04:39:21,800
Come on.

3841
04:39:22,200 --> 04:39:23,060
Come on.

3842
04:39:23,860 --> 04:39:24,420
Okay.

3843
04:39:25,600 --> 04:39:26,160
No!

3844
04:39:26,360 --> 04:39:26,620
No!

3845
04:39:27,200 --> 04:39:27,760
No!

3846
04:39:28,480 --> 04:39:29,040
No!

3847
04:39:29,060 --> 04:39:29,540
No!

3848
04:39:37,230 --> 04:39:38,970
I didn't see the Jeff!

3849
04:39:39,970 --> 04:39:40,850
He did them!

3850
04:39:41,010 --> 04:39:41,810
He did them!

3851
04:39:41,990 --> 04:39:46,590
He used the, um, what he did is he used the high ground.

3852
04:39:46,710 --> 04:39:48,610
So I don't see it.

3853
04:39:49,610 --> 04:39:50,850
Should he just hold it when Jeff went?

3854
04:39:51,770 --> 04:39:53,390
He used that thing.

3855
04:39:53,550 --> 04:39:54,770
Oh my god.

3856
04:39:57,050 --> 04:39:59,710
I didn't see the...

3857
04:39:59,710 --> 04:40:02,430
I didn't know he did the high ground thing.

3858
04:40:04,610 --> 04:40:05,870
He did the fucking...

3859
04:40:06,090 --> 04:40:07,330
stupid-ass high-ground shit.

3860
04:40:08,670 --> 04:40:10,090
And that fucking...

3861
04:40:10,650 --> 04:40:11,570
I should have just ult it.

3862
04:40:12,090 --> 04:40:13,870
I'm just gonna ult when I'm right here, the Jeff up.

3863
04:40:19,190 --> 04:40:20,570
Yeah, it's an exploit.

3864
04:40:21,050 --> 04:40:21,270
Yeah.

3865
04:40:23,450 --> 04:40:25,030
You're not supposed to do it.

3866
04:40:28,070 --> 04:40:30,850
I literally didn't see the Jeff up because of it.

3867
04:40:30,910 --> 04:40:31,350
Because I couldn't...

3868
04:40:31,350 --> 04:40:31,970
This mine's over there.

3869
04:40:32,150 --> 04:40:32,750
Don't fall for it.

3870
04:40:34,930 --> 04:40:36,850
I hate that exploit so much.

3871
04:40:38,230 --> 04:40:39,070
There's two exploits.

3872
04:40:39,090 --> 04:40:39,430
exploits.

3873
04:40:40,190 --> 04:40:41,890
I don't know how to patch the other one.

3874
04:40:42,530 --> 04:40:56,710
The other one was basically, um, the other exploit is that you, um, you can have your jetfall infinitely, but like an infinite jetfall duration, so you don't have to,

3875
04:41:00,670 --> 04:41:05,070
like it, so it's not timed at all, which is pretty fucked if you think about it.

3876
04:41:10,440 --> 04:41:11,580
Oh my god, almost died.

3877
04:41:16,320 --> 04:41:21,040
Okay, let's go.

3878
04:41:22,860 --> 04:41:23,060
Oh.

3879
04:41:24,280 --> 04:41:25,780
Oh, yep.

3880
04:41:27,280 --> 04:41:28,860
Here's nothing I could do.

3881
04:41:33,500 --> 04:41:34,500
That was unlucky.

3882
04:41:35,320 --> 04:41:37,560
It was just me having to walk.

3883
04:41:38,040 --> 04:41:38,900
I die regardless.

3884
04:41:39,060 --> 04:41:39,880
We have no shield.

3885
04:41:41,320 --> 04:41:42,560
We have no shield.

3886
04:41:44,040 --> 04:41:49,220
I require some aid Oh my god, is that shield?

3887
04:41:50,550 --> 04:41:56,940
That's crazy Oh my god, that's a shield

3888
04:42:01,950 --> 04:42:02,980
That's crazy

3889
04:42:10,640 --> 04:42:22,290
Okay Oh Um, um Emma Um, Emma?

3890
04:42:26,090 --> 04:42:30,250
Um, why did our Emma walk- walk in?

3891
04:42:33,850 --> 04:42:36,810
Why did my Emma walk in there?

3892
04:42:38,270 --> 04:42:39,710
I was so confused.

3893
04:42:43,570 --> 04:42:44,690
Oh my god.

3894
04:42:49,430 --> 04:42:52,150
Oh my god.

3895
04:42:53,790 --> 04:42:54,850
Where's my door?

3896
04:42:57,550 --> 04:42:58,150
There you go.

3897
04:42:59,390 --> 04:43:01,370
I'm just like, help, please.

3898
04:43:04,190 --> 04:43:05,090
It's okay.

3899
04:43:06,410 --> 04:43:10,310
If I stand here, maybe I'll be okay.

3900
04:43:11,630 --> 04:43:12,150
Maybe.

3901
04:43:12,650 --> 04:43:14,710
I missed last game, guys.

3902
04:43:14,950 --> 04:43:16,190
Remember last game?

3903
04:43:16,590 --> 04:43:20,990
Where, like, where, like, I didn't have to worry about that?

3904
04:43:20,990 --> 04:43:28,770

3952
04:48:19,400 --> 04:48:20,080
Adam,

3953
04:48:24,420 --> 04:48:24,760

Ew!

3956
04:48:36,120 --> 04:48:38,040
What did I feel like getting juggled?

3957
04:48:38,720 --> 04:48:39,400
My life!

3958
04:48:41,100 --> 04:48:43,760
It was just like a forever juggle.

3959
04:48:44,720 --> 04:48:46,280
Our poor guy, though, I saw that.

3960
04:48:46,460 --> 04:48:46,820
I'm sorry.

3961
04:48:47,480 --> 04:48:48,700

3962
04:48:48,720 --> 04:48:51,800
You, you had, I saw, I had to see what I saw today.

3963
04:48:52,260 --> 04:48:54,620
You did what I did earlier.

3964
04:48:56,560 --> 04:48:56,960
Oh, shit.

3965
04:49:00,400 --> 04:49:01,260
Okay, nice.

04:49:08,530 --> 04:49:09,010
Okay.

3968
04:49:10,290 --> 04:49:11,830
Oh, my God, he's actually one.

3969
04:49:11,950 --> 04:49:12,670
I'm so sad.

3970
04:49:13,750 --> 04:49:14,810
He's actually one.

3971
04:49:20,520 --> 04:49:21,000
Okay.

3972
04:49:21,280 --> 04:49:21,720
Okay.

3973
04:49:25,630 --> 04:49:26,890

Oh my god.

3977
04:49:34,050 --> 04:49:35,070
How did he live?

3978
04:49:35,170 --> 04:49:37,150
I'm so sad he actually lived.

3979
04:49:42,350 --> 04:49:43,770
Do I trust my Adam?

3980
04:49:45,470 --> 04:49:48,190
The most important questions in life.

3981
04:49:49,970 --> 04:49:51,530
Okay, all right, Adam has to raise actually.

3982
04:49:53,150 --> 04:49:54,570
If I get even, I swear to God.

3983
04:49:57,510 --> 04:49:59,350
Oh, that's so unlucky.

3984
04:50:00,870 --> 04:50:03,490
It's spider time!

3985
04:50:04,470 --> 04:50:04,730
Okay.

3986
04:50:07,510 --> 04:50:10,290
Don't mess with the amazing Spider-Man!

3987
04:50:11,550 --> 04:50:12,730
I'm here!

3988
04:50:13,530 --> 04:50:16,070
Oh my god, don't chuck me into the mines!

3989
04:50:19,860 --> 04:50:23,000
Oh my shit, he almost chucked me into the mines!

3990
04:50:23,620 --> 04:50:24,620
Oh my god!

3991
04:50:25,160 --> 04:50:30,140
Oh, I'm alive!

3992
04:50:30,760 --> 04:50:31,540

No!

3999
04:51:34,610 --> 04:51:34,910
He was

4000
04:51:38,480 --> 04:51:38,660
one!

4001
04:51:39,420 --> 04:51:40,780
He was actually one.

4002
04:51:41,660 --> 04:51:42,920
He was actually one.

4003
04:51:45,260 --> 04:51:47,120
You guys have no supports.

4004
04:51:47,220 --> 04:51:48,000
We're coming over!

4005
04:51:48,100 --> 04:51:49,300

04:51:50,260 --> 04:51:50,760
We're skating!

4012
04:52:02,450 --> 04:52:03,010
Okay.

4013
04:52:14,410 --> 04:52:15,850
Okay, there you go.

4014
04:52:16,130 --> 04:52:17,150
You know what they say?

4015
04:52:22,900 --> 04:52:24,240
We did it.

4016
04:52:24,400 --> 04:52:26,360
We actually won that.

4017
04:52:27,100 --> 04:52:28,340
Let's go.

4018
04:52:28,800 --> 04:52:29,640
I did.

4019
04:52:30,120 --> 04:52:30,780
Bro, okay.

4020
04:52:31,360 --> 04:52:38,680
That Adam, the Adam team up actually fucking saved my life so much.

4021
04:52:38,960 --> 04:52:39,860
No, Gasser's not here.

4022
04:52:39,900 --> 04:52:45,300
I said if we win four games in a row, we're not yet where I hit top five.

4023
04:52:45,340 --> 04:52:47,760
100, then Cancer is here.

4024
04:52:48,120 --> 04:52:51,760
Our Adam actually saved my fucking life so much.

4025
04:52:52,440 --> 04:52:55,500
Oh my god, I got Celestia 2.

4026
04:52:56,180 --> 04:52:57,240
That's crazy.

4027
04:52:57,880 --> 04:53:00,860
I'm actually in Celestia 2 now.

4028
04:53:03,540 --> 04:53:05,240
I did a win.

4029
04:53:05,640 --> 04:53:06,240
Three.

4030
04:53:06,560 --> 04:53:07,540
I think like three.

4031
04:53:07,720 --> 04:53:09,160
That's crazy.

4032
04:53:09,720 --> 04:53:10,400
800.

4033
04:53:10,860 --> 04:53:13,120
And the dream is actually real.

4034
04:53:14,000 --> 04:53:14,960
Holy fuck.

4035
04:53:15,340 --> 04:53:16,240
What happened?

4036
04:53:17,600 --> 04:53:18,740
Not yet.

4037
04:53:19,260 --> 04:53:19,820
Not yet.

4038
04:53:19,940 --> 04:53:22,780
I knew when three in a row.

4039
04:53:23,300 --> 04:53:25,320
You know what it is.

4040
04:53:25,860 --> 04:53:28,220
Guys, we can buy the gear for cats.

4041
04:53:28,740 --> 04:53:31,320
Oh my god, we did it.

4042
04:53:31,580 --> 04:53:34,080
Web, web, web, web, web linked.

4043
04:53:37,140 --> 04:53:38,380
That's crazy.

4044
04:53:40,280 --> 04:53:40,860
Yes.

4045
04:53:42,960 --> 04:53:43,840
We...

4046
04:53:43,840 --> 04:53:44,280
Again.

4047
04:53:48,500 --> 04:53:52,360
The rake terrorist never gets punished.

4048
04:53:53,500 --> 04:53:56,020
I'm going to lose seven in a row now that you said that, chat.

4049
04:53:56,440 --> 04:53:58,500
I'm going to lose seven in a row.

4050
04:53:58,860 --> 04:54:00,940
There's no such thing as a good thing.

4051
04:54:01,900 --> 04:54:03,380
Never hope, chat.

4052
04:54:04,060 --> 04:54:05,080
Never hope.

4053
04:54:08,180 --> 04:54:09,920
Oh my gosh.

4054
04:54:10,540 --> 04:54:11,320
Noah Woods.

4055
04:54:11,520 --> 04:54:12,440
I mean, everybody did.

4056
04:54:12,580 --> 04:54:14,840
That was an intense fucking game.

4057
04:54:15,340 --> 04:54:17,620
Wait, I need to watch this one again.

4058
04:54:17,780 --> 04:54:19,780
I need to see the POV of the...

4059
04:54:19,780 --> 04:54:21,160
That guy must be so mad.

4060
04:54:21,320 --> 04:54:21,980
He must be so...

4061
04:54:21,980 --> 04:54:23,040
I'd be tilted too.

4062
04:54:23,320 --> 04:54:24,100
Not gonna lie.

4063
04:54:24,660 --> 04:54:26,300
I'd be so tilted.

4064
04:54:26,880 --> 04:54:29,140
Like, that shit was bullshit.

4065
04:54:29,700 --> 04:54:32,320
Like, that shit was actually so stupid.

4066
04:54:33,060 --> 04:54:34,260
Alright, there you go.

4067
04:54:38,740 --> 04:54:39,020
Yep.

4068
04:54:39,680 --> 04:54:40,780
I'm like, get out.

4069
04:54:41,020 --> 04:54:41,340
Leave.

4070
04:54:41,880 --> 04:54:42,060
Leave.

4071
04:54:46,500 --> 04:54:49,780
She's like, why is she full HP again?

4072
04:54:49,960 --> 04:54:50,100
Why?

4073
04:54:52,720 --> 04:54:55,280
Bro, that must have been so still.

4074
04:54:56,000 --> 04:54:57,280
Dash, dash, dash, dash.

4075
04:54:59,480 --> 04:54:59,780
Alright.

4076
04:55:01,920 --> 04:55:03,080
The link.

4077
04:55:03,820 --> 04:55:05,410
Okay, I need to see this in a...

4078
04:55:06,260 --> 04:55:06,620
Alright.

4079
04:55:08,480 --> 04:55:10,500
No, I gotta...

4080
04:55:10,500 --> 04:55:11,300
Recam this.

4081
04:55:11,500 --> 04:55:12,540
I need to see this.

4082
04:55:12,860 --> 04:55:14,100
What does that look like?

4083
04:55:15,880 --> 04:55:21,880
Right here Alright, he's like my new target Link!

4084
04:55:23,080 --> 04:55:23,080
Link!

4085
04:55:24,660 --> 04:55:28,960
Why is she dying?

4086
04:55:29,440 --> 04:55:35,320
He did everything for nothing I like squashed a little...

4087
04:55:35,320 --> 04:55:38,500
How did you choose?

4088
04:55:41,220 --> 04:55:42,300
Yeah

4089
04:55:46,000 --> 04:55:47,900
Oh, oh, we have borderline.

4090
04:55:48,120 --> 04:55:50,180
I hope, I hope you're not throwing today.

4091
04:55:50,460 --> 04:55:52,220
What hero do you think you want to be today?

4092
04:55:52,380 --> 04:55:54,660
Sometimes they like to play Scarlet, which...

4093
04:55:55,320 --> 04:55:57,880
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

4094
04:55:58,740 --> 04:56:03,120
Bro left you with more HP when I see when he started.

4095
04:56:04,340 --> 04:56:05,120
It's true.

4096
04:56:06,080 --> 04:56:07,020
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

4097
04:56:07,220 --> 04:56:07,880
That's true.

4098
04:56:08,680 --> 04:56:10,960
Who am I going to banish from this match?

4099
04:56:15,560 --> 04:57:14,010

They can feel the altrui.

4101
04:57:22,910 --> 04:57:23,890
I'm not gonna go to Mantis.

4102
04:57:31,020 --> 04:57:32,720
Alright, here we go.

4103
04:57:40,890 --> 04:57:43,670
This vision's 21-21.

04:57:46,590 --> 04:57:47,750
Alright, here we go.

4105
04:57:53,250 --> 04:57:54,190
They can feel it.

4106
04:57:54,210 --> 04:57:55,410
They feel the enemy.

4107
04:57:56,050 --> 04:57:57,730
They were Daredevil before Daredevil.

4108
04:57:57,750 --> 04:57:58,010
Daredevil.

4109
04:57:58,550 --> 04:58:00,990
It's the anti-Daredevil.

4110
04:58:04,290 --> 04:58:05,850
Guys, would you like some inspiration?

4111
04:58:07,390 --> 04:58:07,990
Don't worry.

4112
04:58:09,650 --> 04:58:11,930
There's a motivation dance for everybody.

4113
04:58:12,250 --> 04:58:13,770

Oh, oh no, my mouse died.

4137
05:00:20,340 --> 05:00:21,940
We might have very limited.

4138
05:00:22,680 --> 05:00:23,920
Okay, we're gonna have very limited.

4139
05:00:24,260 --> 05:00:25,240
Very, very limited.

05:00:25,980 --> 05:00:27,580
Movement right now.

4141
05:00:30,940 --> 05:00:33,060

Alright.

4145
05:00:41,320 --> 05:00:41,760
That's fine.

4146
05:00:42,020 --> 05:00:43,160
I'm scared of getting...

4147
05:00:43,160 --> 05:00:44,180
Hey, don't get caught.

4148
05:00:45,400 --> 05:00:45,640
Go.

4149
05:00:46,640 --> 05:00:46,960
It's all I got.

4150
05:00:47,340 --> 05:00:47,700
Yeah.

4151
05:00:47,980 --> 05:00:48,380

4152
05:00:48,620 --> 05:00:49,400

4153
05:00:49,400 --> 05:00:49,980
I'm sorry.

4154
05:00:50,060 --> 05:00:50,680
I'm not throwing.

4155
05:00:51,080 --> 05:00:51,900
I'm not throwing.

4156
05:00:51,980 --> 05:00:53,060
I just have...

4157
05:00:53,060 --> 05:00:55,180
My mouse actually died.

4158
05:00:58,320 --> 05:00:59,360
Okay, after...

4159
05:00:59,360 --> 05:01:01,660
Okay, I think my mouse would be charged up.

4160
05:01:02,320 --> 05:01:04,140
I think I should have charged it before.

4161
05:01:11,010 --> 05:01:11,810
Oh, Maya.

4162
05:01:12,030 --> 05:01:12,190
Oh, Maya.

4163
05:01:13,630 --> 05:01:15,410
Can you guys look out?

4164
05:01:17,590 --> 05:01:17,790
Okay.

4165
05:01:22,930 --> 05:01:23,990
Oh, this is bad.

4166
05:01:25,970 --> 05:01:26,710
Oh, my God.

4167
05:01:26,850 --> 05:01:27,910
I just got it, too.

4168
05:01:36,550 --> 05:01:37,510
All right, it's fine.

4169
05:01:38,610 --> 05:01:38,830
Nope.

4170
05:01:41,910 --> 05:01:42,610
Oh, my God.

4171
05:01:42,810 --> 05:01:43,730
I can't do anything.

4172
05:01:43,910 --> 05:01:45,750
I'm trying to fix my rounds.

4173
05:01:47,670 --> 05:01:48,110
Okay.

4174
05:01:48,430 --> 05:01:49,670
I have more rage now.

4175
05:01:49,870 --> 05:01:50,670
I have more.

4176
05:01:50,830 --> 05:01:52,630
Oh my god, okay, I have more range.

4177
05:01:52,770 --> 05:01:53,870
I have more range.

4178
05:01:55,230 --> 05:01:56,050
Okay, it's fine.

4179
05:01:56,650 --> 05:01:57,010
It's fine.

4180
05:02:01,740 --> 05:02:03,780
Okay, I have my full range now.

4181
05:02:12,290 --> 05:02:13,330
We're gonna...

4182
05:02:13,330 --> 05:02:15,270
I'm not... It's fine.

4183
05:02:15,390 --> 05:02:16,490
I'm not off the wall.

4184
05:02:22,340 --> 05:02:22,860
Okay.

4185
05:02:23,300 --> 05:02:23,900
Oh, shit!

4186
05:02:24,280 --> 05:02:24,880
Not okay?

4187
05:02:25,320 --> 05:02:27,180
Oh my god, not okay.

4188
05:02:27,300 --> 05:02:29,140
There was a group behind us!

4189
05:02:29,160 --> 05:02:29,420
Yes!

4190
05:02:33,870 --> 05:02:34,150
Okay.

4191
05:02:35,470 --> 05:02:36,190
It's time.

4192
05:02:38,450 --> 05:02:39,430
It's time.

4193
05:02:40,130 --> 05:02:42,330
Doing the one thing I know what to do.

4194
05:02:43,730 --> 05:02:44,350
It's time.

4195
05:02:52,190 --> 05:02:53,790
Doing the one thing I know.

4196
05:02:54,650 --> 05:02:55,410
What to do.

4197
05:03:01,540 --> 05:03:02,840
Doing the one thing I know.

4198
05:03:03,480 --> 05:03:04,380
Come down now.

4199
05:03:07,500 --> 05:03:09,800
Doing the one thing I know.

4200
05:03:12,960 --> 05:03:14,040
What the fuck?

4201
05:03:15,260 --> 05:03:17,060
What the fuck is this?

4202
05:03:17,180 --> 05:03:19,100
What the fuck is this ever doing here?

4203
05:03:19,260 --> 05:03:20,260
Okay, okay.

4204
05:03:23,000 --> 05:03:24,240
I'm sorry.

4205
05:03:24,740 --> 05:03:28,180
Sorry my mouse died so I can't really play me.

4206
05:03:28,200 --> 05:03:29,300
Why is Iron Fist breaking?

4207
05:03:32,260 --> 05:03:33,540
I'm sorry.

4208
05:03:34,300 --> 05:03:36,220
If my mouse died.

4209
05:03:36,240 --> 05:03:37,160
It died!

4210
05:03:39,440 --> 05:03:42,560
If my mouse didn't die, it would have been fine.

4211
05:03:43,180 --> 05:03:44,960
But my mouse died.

4212
05:03:45,140 --> 05:03:46,020
I'm sorry!

4213
05:03:49,060 --> 05:03:51,120
It was my bad.

4214
05:03:51,900 --> 05:03:54,220
It was an oopsie doopsy.

4215
05:03:57,140 --> 05:04:00,500
It was a little oopsie.

4216
05:04:01,020 --> 05:04:03,540
Yeah, it's just a little oopsie.

4217
05:04:04,440 --> 05:04:05,600
I'm sorry.

4218
05:04:15,400 --> 05:04:16,020
Okay.

4219
05:04:21,140 --> 05:04:22,660
Oh my god.

4220
05:04:23,180 --> 05:04:25,560
I got rid of my res.

4221
05:04:26,060 --> 05:04:26,640
A lot of them.

4222
05:04:28,960 --> 05:04:29,980
Okay, it's fine.

4223
05:04:31,560 --> 05:04:31,880
It's fine.

4224
05:04:32,760 --> 05:04:44,840

4226
05:04:59,270 --> 05:05:09,130
It's okay, I have my res See, he's fine He's not fine But the others were fine.

4227
05:05:12,530 --> 05:05:14,910
You know, the others are okay.

4228
05:05:16,350 --> 05:05:17,210
He's fine too.

4229
05:05:17,330 --> 05:05:18,270
I think he's fine.

4230
05:05:20,150 --> 05:05:21,450
He's fine too.

4231
05:05:24,070 --> 05:05:24,910
It's okay.

4232
05:05:25,010 --> 05:05:25,610
I'm chilling.

4233
05:05:27,330 --> 05:05:29,010
Don't have to worry about me.

4234
05:05:29,530 --> 05:05:30,750
I'm just down here.

4235
05:05:32,990 --> 05:05:34,790
Maybe we'll destroy it.

4236
05:05:37,690 --> 05:05:40,130
He's gonna have Starlord ult, isn't he?

4237
05:05:41,110 --> 05:05:42,570
Three, two, one.

4238
05:05:43,770 --> 05:05:44,330
Oh, shit.

4239
05:05:46,590 --> 05:05:47,450
No, never mind.

4240
05:05:47,610 --> 05:05:49,670
He'll have Brutal, which is even worse.

4241
05:05:57,270 --> 05:05:59,610
Okay, I think my mouse is charged enough.

4242
05:06:00,330 --> 05:06:01,390
I'm pretty sure.

4243
05:06:01,990 --> 05:06:02,450
I could play.

4244
05:06:03,230 --> 05:06:04,110
Maybe Adam?

4245
05:06:05,030 --> 05:06:06,190
Maybe Adam will be better.

4246
05:06:07,590 --> 05:06:10,710
Switch things up, including which side you're on.

4247
05:06:12,310 --> 05:06:16,550
Okay, I did throw a little bit because my mouse died, and then I very limited my cable.

4248
05:06:16,550 --> 05:06:18,170
My cable was all caught up.

4249
05:06:18,530 --> 05:06:23,530
So I did, I would say I was the one that quit.

4250
05:06:23,650 --> 05:06:27,230
I was the one that ruined the cure for cancer.

4251
05:06:31,270 --> 05:06:37,230
I, I, guys, I would admit that maybe I might have fucked it up.

4252
05:06:37,590 --> 05:06:43,790
I might have messed up there.

4253
05:06:45,110 --> 05:06:46,290
I can do this, maybe.

4254
05:06:47,370 --> 05:06:51,890
I believe Little Timmy would not make it because your mouth's tight.

4255
05:06:52,390 --> 05:06:55,770
That was maybe my bad.

4256
05:06:56,250 --> 05:06:57,610
Just me.

4257
05:06:59,810 --> 05:07:02,930
It was maybe my fault when that happened.

4258
05:07:03,870 --> 05:07:05,230
What a strange alliance.

4259
05:07:05,490 --> 05:07:06,170
My mouse.

4260
05:07:06,890 --> 05:07:07,570
Wait, let me see how much it's.

4261
05:07:08,630 --> 05:07:14,330
That 10 hour of rivals may not have been, oh my god, it's only at 10% right now.

4262
05:07:25,320 --> 05:07:27,940
Well, my bad bring back.

4263
05:07:30,860 --> 05:07:34,040
Look, I said I'm sorry, is that not enough?

4264
05:07:38,740 --> 05:07:40,700
I said I'm sorry.

4265
05:07:50,110 --> 05:08:17,130

Jesus Christ, he built so fast.

4267
05:08:23,150 --> 05:08:26,370
I don't think we have anybody that can play.

4268
05:08:26,670 --> 05:08:28,510
I don't think anyone in the team played War.

4269
05:08:30,710 --> 05:08:31,610
Oh, Ultron.

4270
05:08:31,770 --> 05:08:33,470
Oh my god, Ultron, you crazy.

4271
05:08:38,980 --> 05:08:40,080
Okay, we have to...

4272
05:08:40,080 --> 05:08:41,420
I'm fucking leaving.

4273
05:08:42,040 --> 05:08:43,620
I gotta play for Res right now.

4274
05:08:47,290 --> 05:08:48,290
I don't know.

4275
05:08:49,610 --> 05:08:50,210
What's up?

4276
05:08:50,310 --> 05:08:50,670
I don't even know.

4277
05:08:50,670 --> 05:08:51,110
What's up?

4278
05:08:51,890 --> 05:08:52,130
Alright.

4279
05:08:52,250 --> 05:08:54,130
Three, two, one.

05:08:58,930 --> 05:08:59,450
Okay.

05:09:00,670 --> 05:09:01,710
Okay, we...

4283
05:09:07,870 --> 05:09:09,430
I would like to say...

4284
05:09:09,950 --> 05:09:11,010
That ain't on me.

4285
05:09:14,270 --> 05:09:15,830
That wasn't on me.

4286
05:09:16,390 --> 05:09:18,430
I did the res and everything.

4287
05:09:18,510 --> 05:09:19,410

05:11:33,910 --> 05:11:37,130
It's like Calvin, he bought Calvin all over again.

4295
05:11:38,730 --> 05:11:38,970
Alright.

4296
05:11:41,930 --> 05:11:42,650

Thanks for the shield.

4298
05:11:44,310 --> 05:11:44,690
Okay.

4299
05:11:49,690 --> 05:11:50,410
Hello.

4300
05:11:50,770 --> 05:11:51,490
Okay.

4301
05:11:55,710 --> 05:11:58,510
I didn't do a boring game.

4302
05:12:00,930 --> 05:12:02,070
Did my job.

4303
05:12:02,550 --> 05:12:04,550
I don't know what else I could do.

4304
05:12:05,110 --> 05:12:08,710
Like, I did my job.

4305
05:12:13,860 --> 05:12:14,860
Guys, I guess.

4306
05:12:15,100 --> 05:12:16,520
Oh my god.

4307
05:12:18,020 --> 05:12:19,220
Minus 20.

4308
05:12:19,460 --> 05:12:20,700
Not, guys, I'm sorry.

4309
05:12:21,180 --> 05:12:25,640
But it looks like Little Timmy might not make it to Christmas, guys.

4310
05:12:27,280 --> 05:12:29,480
But it's not my fault chat.

4311
05:12:29,920 --> 05:12:33,960
It's not okay my mouse dying might have been my fault my

4312
05:12:37,980 --> 05:12:42,680
My mouse died might have been my fault, but I was not though.

4313
05:12:42,840 --> 05:12:48,640
I was not part of the problem where in my my entire team went three DPS

4314
05:12:52,800 --> 05:12:58,840
Look my mouse I was part of the problem But I was like 1% of the problem.

4315
05:12:59,320 --> 05:13:03,180
My mouse dying was only 1% of what happened.

4316
05:13:06,140 --> 05:13:13,260
There were 99% of other things that had led to this moment in time.

4317
05:13:15,400 --> 05:13:18,400
Yeah, it's charging right now.

4318
05:13:21,580 --> 05:13:23,140
Don't worry, it's charging right now.

4319
05:13:23,240 --> 05:13:25,500
I'm not a full piece of shit yet.

4320
05:13:30,460 --> 05:13:36,980
I was such an ELO terrorist that I got the Celestio 2, which was top 800.

4321
05:13:38,540 --> 05:13:40,560
Celestio 2 is top 500 right now.

4322
05:13:42,620 --> 05:13:45,920
That I was such an ELO terrorist that I somehow started climbing.

4323
05:13:46,060 --> 05:13:46,680
I don't know how.

4324
05:13:47,080 --> 05:13:47,740
It was weird.

4325
05:13:48,340 --> 05:13:49,680
This was not my intent.

4326
05:13:50,380 --> 05:13:56,600
I literally, my intent was to maybe derank the GM, but I ended up getting into Celestio 2.

4327
05:13:59,040 --> 05:14:08,040
I think like Rocket joined in like maybe Rocket joined in like two games ago

4334
05:15:52,650 --> 05:15:53,310
Push, Ben.

4335
05:15:58,510 --> 05:16:01,150
Now I think I need to win four games.

4336
05:16:02,410 --> 05:16:07,090
I need to win like four games in a row to secure it.

4337
05:16:08,210 --> 05:16:09,130
I'm buying ammo.

4338
05:16:09,450 --> 05:16:10,070
Fuck this.

4339
05:16:11,230 --> 05:16:13,790
Wait, this is Drac- I'm buying a Jeff.

4340
05:16:14,890 --> 05:16:15,550
No Jeff?

4341
05:16:17,010 --> 05:16:18,390
Jeff sucks on this map.

4342
05:16:18,890 --> 05:16:20,910
Jeff is so- Bruce, really?

4343
05:16:22,230 --> 05:16:23,510
I guess both sucks.

4344
05:16:24,030 --> 05:16:27,050
This map sucks for Jeff because there's so much open corridors.

4345
05:16:28,570 --> 05:16:30,150
I think Adderban is fine.

4346
05:16:33,470 --> 05:16:34,190
Never mind.

4347
05:16:35,170 --> 05:16:38,770

Like, that's all that matters.

4362
05:18:45,640 --> 05:18:46,860
No more hooks for me.

4363
05:18:52,940 --> 05:18:53,000

When did the wolf show up?

4379
05:20:02,780 --> 05:20:04,100

Guys, no.

4381
05:20:05,420 --> 05:20:08,440
This does not look ideal right now.

4382
05:20:08,900 --> 05:20:10,200
It really doesn't.

4383
05:20:10,900 --> 05:20:12,940

It's not okay for him, but it's okay for me.

4387
05:20:26,880 --> 05:20:27,920
Oh, goodbye.

4388

05:20:43,100 --> 05:20:44,520
Let's hope I don't die.

4392
05:20:48,880 --> 05:20:50,620
We didn't get the nest.

4393
05:20:53,400 --> 05:21:22,720

Oh, it didn't matter.

4395
05:21:25,520 --> 05:21:26,080
They still died.

4396
05:21:26,360 --> 05:21:26,660
Thank God.

4397
05:21:28,540 --> 05:21:29,660
Thank fucking God.

4398
05:21:34,390 --> 05:21:35,710
Never trust a team.

4399
05:21:36,290 --> 05:21:36,610
I know.

4400
05:21:37,110 --> 05:21:38,050
Sometimes I'm just ignorant.

4401
05:21:38,530 --> 05:21:40,890
Sometimes I'm just like, maybe it'll be different.

4402
05:21:41,290 --> 05:21:41,490
You know?

4403
05:21:43,810 --> 05:21:45,830
Maybe today will be different.

4404
05:21:46,290 --> 05:21:47,610
But like, it's still gonna be me.

4405
05:21:47,710 --> 05:21:49,130
Today will never be different.

4406
05:21:49,470 --> 05:21:50,870

4456
05:26:01,520 --> 05:26:02,040
He's...

4457
05:26:07,060 --> 05:26:11,440
Guys, listen, we did not deserve this win.

4458
05:26:13,280 --> 05:26:15,640
Hardest 5v6, by the way.

4459
05:26:16,120 --> 05:26:23,200
Bro, the fact that we got to 5v6 on overtime.

4460
05:26:24,740 --> 05:26:26,260

And yeah, I don't know if I said it right, but thank you for Twitch Prime.

4463
05:26:30,380 --> 05:26:30,760

4468
05:27:08,110 --> 05:27:08,610
Alright.

4469
05:27:11,230 --> 05:27:13,410
How much do you charge that guy?

4470
05:27:13,530 --> 05:27:14,590
I didn't pay him.

4471
05:27:14,990 --> 05:27:15,550
I just know.

4472
05:27:15,950 --> 05:27:19,910
I found where he lives and I sent someone.

4473
05:27:20,290 --> 05:27:21,730
I sent my regards.

4474
05:27:22,770 --> 05:27:22,870
Four.

4475
05:27:25,750 --> 05:27:26,030
One.

4476
05:27:27,250 --> 05:27:29,750
You have to stop there from securing the mission area.

4477
05:27:30,170 --> 05:27:30,590
Yay!

4478
05:27:32,410 --> 05:27:32,490
Yay!

4479
05:27:38,610 --> 05:27:39,650
Thank

4480
05:27:47,640 --> 05:27:49,300
you, God.

4481
05:27:50,040 --> 05:27:50,880
God is real.

4482
05:27:55,980 --> 05:27:57,000
Hard earned.

4483
05:27:57,260 --> 05:27:58,240
Oh, man.

4484
05:27:58,680 --> 05:28:00,100
So hard earned.

4485
05:28:00,320 --> 05:28:01,760
My plus 16.

4486
05:28:03,360 --> 05:28:06,360
It's what I like to see.

4487
05:28:07,200 --> 05:28:10,400
My plus 16.

4488
05:28:12,100 --> 05:28:15,680
That's what I'm talking about!

4489
05:28:16,880 --> 05:28:21,530
I worked so hard for that.

4490
05:28:21,650 --> 05:28:23,670
The 16, baby.

4491
05:28:25,770 --> 05:28:27,590
It's so very hard.

4492
05:28:29,390 --> 05:28:31,150
Now I'm 16, dopamine.

4493
05:28:31,610 --> 05:28:34,670
I'm currently 832 right now.

4494
05:28:35,150 --> 05:28:36,670
How many places is it?

4495
05:28:37,430 --> 05:28:37,830
Yeah.

4496
05:28:38,950 --> 05:28:39,710
830.

4497
05:28:39,890 --> 05:28:41,890
I think it would be high Celestia, too.

4498
05:28:42,230 --> 05:28:43,350
In 24 hours?

4499
05:28:45,910 --> 05:28:47,470
I don't know, actually.

4500
05:28:48,870 --> 05:28:50,550
Because, like, top 250...

4501
05:28:50,550 --> 05:28:54,730
I feel like maybe, like, 50 points, maybe?

4502
05:28:55,610 --> 05:28:59,590
I think 50 points would be, in rate...

4503
05:28:59,590 --> 05:29:00,770
Would be, like, safe.

4504
05:29:03,490 --> 05:29:04,950
Why am I hoping?

4505
05:29:06,090 --> 05:29:08,050
Nope, never gets me far.

4506
05:29:10,150 --> 05:29:12,050
Just think about terrorizing.

4507
05:29:12,230 --> 05:29:15,630
I won games that I should never have won today.

4508
05:29:17,130 --> 05:29:18,510
That's actually crazy.

4509
05:29:19,890 --> 05:29:21,070
There were so many games.

4510
05:29:21,410 --> 05:29:22,410
Jesus is cool.

4511
05:29:23,170 --> 05:29:24,250
How cool is Jesus?

4512
05:29:26,070 --> 05:29:29,850
How cool is Jesus?

4513
05:29:29,850 --> 05:29:31,430
Is Jesus how cool?

4514
05:29:32,450 --> 05:29:33,190
There you go.

4515
05:29:37,990 --> 05:29:39,550
What a name.

4516
05:29:40,170 --> 05:29:41,090
Jesus is cool.

4517
05:29:44,130 --> 05:29:45,410
Very cool.

4518
05:29:46,210 --> 05:29:47,750
What makes him cool?

4519
05:29:53,540 --> 05:29:55,140
Let's keep posing.

4520
05:30:01,890 --> 05:30:02,850
I'm waiting for him.

4521
05:30:03,070 --> 05:30:06,870
I want to know what makes Jesus so cool to him.

4522
05:30:07,470 --> 05:30:09,250
I want to know his life story.

4523
05:30:10,130 --> 05:30:12,510
He was a good person.

4524
05:30:12,990 --> 05:30:15,530
But I feel like I'm talking to a child.

4525
05:30:20,150 --> 05:30:22,030
He is not rot.

4526
05:30:23,910 --> 05:30:25,270
Who's shooting me?

4527
05:30:25,350 --> 05:30:26,830
Oh, it's epic duck.

4528
05:30:27,910 --> 05:30:29,790
That sounds cool.

4529
05:30:31,150 --> 05:30:32,930
Being good is pretty cool!

4530
05:30:35,210 --> 05:30:37,410
Oh my god, who the fuck is this guy?

4531
05:30:37,690 --> 05:30:39,630
Who is the... I'm RC champion.

4532
05:30:41,030 --> 05:30:43,170
That's on the enemy team right now.

4533
05:30:43,630 --> 05:30:44,710
Who the fuck is he?

4534
05:30:49,810 --> 05:30:50,790
Don't worry.

4535
05:30:53,430 --> 05:30:55,770
I should maybe worry a little bit.

4536
05:30:58,050 --> 05:30:58,530
Okay.

4537
05:30:59,890 --> 05:31:00,350
Okay.

4538
05:31:01,450 --> 05:31:03,150
I think I charged enough.

4539
05:31:03,430 --> 05:31:07,030
I think 40% is enough, right?

4540
05:31:07,890 --> 05:31:09,230
40% should be enough.

4541
05:31:14,490 --> 05:31:16,590
I'll be like, do you want to be as cool as Jesus?

4542
05:31:21,040 --> 05:31:24,840
Do you want to be a good person and be just as cool as Jesus right now?

4543
05:31:26,120 --> 05:31:27,240
You know what to do.

4544
05:31:30,820 --> 05:31:32,760
Yeah, I got 40%.

4545
05:31:32,760 --> 05:31:33,660
I think that's enough.

4546
05:31:37,750 --> 05:31:39,290
Uh, oh my god, I got 60!

4547
05:31:39,790 --> 05:31:42,210
Wait, GPO Wireless charges so fast.

4548
05:31:52,410 --> 05:31:52,930
Yeah.

4549
05:31:53,450 --> 05:31:56,150
I'm not sponsored, by the way, but I love GPO Wireless.

4550
05:31:56,290 --> 05:31:57,990
They're just...

4551
05:32:00,820 --> 05:32:02,880
It's just so fast when it's charging.

4552
05:32:05,280 --> 05:32:06,160
Pick your hero.

4553
05:32:06,620 --> 05:32:08,220
Or villain, I'm not judging.

4554
05:32:09,400 --> 05:32:10,700
Is she close?

4555
05:32:13,120 --> 05:32:13,680
Stop hoping.

4556
05:32:15,080 --> 05:32:15,400
Hope is.

4557
05:32:15,680 --> 05:32:16,800
Hope is a lie.

4558
05:32:18,960 --> 05:32:21,120
You'll only get disappointed.

4559
05:32:24,740 --> 05:32:27,040
Only disappointment lies ahead.

4560
05:32:28,580 --> 05:32:29,200
Hope is cope.

4561
05:32:29,460 --> 05:32:29,940
Exactly.

4562
05:32:31,800 --> 05:32:33,680
You're just coping if you're hoping.

4563
05:32:33,900 --> 05:32:34,920
We are just okay.

4564
05:32:35,760 --> 05:32:36,900
We don't need shields.

4565
05:32:42,480 --> 05:32:43,340
I'll be there.

4566
05:32:43,360 --> 05:32:57,180

4568
05:33:09,580 --> 05:33:12,340
wait that's an insane strat

4569
05:33:15,560 --> 05:33:18,660
To be fair, that's not much because I'll add anyone.

4570
05:33:19,020 --> 05:33:23,080
If I see you're close to top 500, or if you are top 500.

4571
05:33:36,980 --> 05:33:38,880
Do none of us have that?

4572
05:33:42,670 --> 05:33:44,490
Okay, none of us have front lines.

4573
05:33:44,810 --> 05:33:45,290
That's cool.

4574
05:33:46,090 --> 05:33:46,690
I like...

4575
05:33:46,690 --> 05:33:48,510
What the fuck?

4576
05:33:49,590 --> 05:33:51,350
You got deleted!

4577
05:33:52,510 --> 05:33:53,550
Holy shit!

4578
05:33:54,090 --> 05:33:59,330
Oh my god.

4579
05:33:59,810 --> 05:34:01,610
Oh, he's cute.

4580
05:34:04,330 --> 05:34:05,250
Yes!

4581
05:34:07,300 --> 05:34:09,500
Guys, it went through again.

4582
05:34:13,340 --> 05:34:15,160
Guys, it went through.

4583
05:34:15,760 --> 05:34:17,640
It went through again.

4584
05:34:18,460 --> 05:34:21,100
They were like, this is not possible.

4585
05:34:22,420 --> 05:34:23,620
They did not.

4586
05:34:24,260 --> 05:34:25,760
No way.

4587
05:34:25,840 --> 05:34:27,280
He heard.

4588
05:34:27,480 --> 05:34:29,900
He's like, God, I want to be on a friend's list.

4589
05:34:32,140 --> 05:34:34,300
That's actually insane.

4590
05:34:36,280 --> 05:34:36,680
Yay.

4591
05:34:41,080 --> 05:34:41,460
Yay.

4592
05:34:43,880 --> 05:34:45,160
Dodging is wrong.

4593
05:34:48,440 --> 05:34:49,080
Disclaimer.

4594
05:34:49,520 --> 05:34:51,320
In case any of the devs are...

4595
05:34:51,320 --> 05:34:52,900
I'm not endorsing it.

4596
05:34:53,140 --> 05:34:53,780
I...

4597
05:34:53,780 --> 05:34:54,600
But yay.

4598
05:34:57,840 --> 05:35:27,800
dodging is not cool guys but if you happen to dodge on my team when we're losing i mean like you know things happen you know and so that whoa that guy's ended it went down at such an awkward time chat thank god and jesus wouldn't dodge about his ISP, guys.

4599
05:35:29,700 --> 05:35:31,740
A dog ate his Ethernet cable.

4600
05:35:34,740 --> 05:35:35,860
Pretty unfortunate.

4601
05:35:36,220 --> 05:35:36,940
Are we dodging?

4602
05:35:37,680 --> 05:35:38,660
Are we dodging?

4603
05:35:39,140 --> 05:35:40,040
I don't even know.

4604
05:35:40,260 --> 05:35:41,140
Are we dodging a queue?

4605
05:35:41,680 --> 05:35:43,920
Oh, hey, there's Mopko fat.

4606
05:35:44,380 --> 05:35:46,160
Wait, did he secure Top 500?

4607
05:35:47,180 --> 05:35:50,360
He adds me on his up and not on my main?

4608
05:35:52,560 --> 05:35:53,120
Ouch.

4609
05:35:56,260 --> 05:35:57,280
That hurt.

4610
05:36:02,620 --> 05:36:03,280
You're...

4611
05:36:03,280 --> 05:36:04,760
I'm the side account.

4612
05:36:05,220 --> 05:36:05,560
Yeah.

4613
05:36:07,900 --> 05:36:08,600
I'm...

4614
05:36:08,600 --> 05:36:09,040
Bro.

4615
05:36:09,900 --> 05:36:12,680
Bro, I'm the side account friend.

4616
05:36:13,440 --> 05:36:16,220
I'm only second account material.

4617
05:36:17,380 --> 05:36:18,840
Bro, that hurts.

4618
05:36:19,220 --> 05:36:19,580
Man.

4619
05:36:19,900 --> 05:36:21,300
To be fair, this is the second account.

4620
05:36:21,440 --> 05:36:22,760
Bro, what the fuck?

4621
05:36:23,200 --> 05:36:25,780
I have so many people's second accounts.

4622
05:36:25,840 --> 05:36:26,400
added.

4623
05:36:27,280 --> 05:36:30,700
I even have Cal's second account on my friend's list.

4624
05:36:30,840 --> 05:36:33,120
Not the real Cal's main account.

4625
05:36:38,780 --> 05:36:39,140
That.

4626
05:36:42,460 --> 05:36:44,240
Actually, side account.

4627
05:36:44,780 --> 05:36:45,500
Yeah, I'm not.

4628
05:36:47,160 --> 05:36:48,920
I'm the side duo.

4629
05:36:49,080 --> 05:36:52,240
I'm the one where, like, not gonna risk my main.

4630
05:36:53,580 --> 05:36:54,260

Why and when you can, well, it's not just curing cancer.

4640
05:38:25,900 --> 05:38:29,100
There's also, uh, solving world hunger.

and i've already given up on my dream so i'm here to crush other people's dreams too But yes, I usually stream on YouTube.

4644
05:39:57,500 --> 05:40:00,440
But yeah, today I'm just playing Rank Evil.

4645
05:40:00,620 --> 05:40:05,760
For those who don't know, Top 500 is Celestial 2 right now.

4646
05:40:06,960 --> 05:40:10,420
I'm currently at Celestial 2 at the moment.

4647
05:40:12,120 --> 05:40:14,800
I'm also currently, I'm Ranked 829.

4648
05:40:15,420 --> 05:40:17,100
It wasn't supposed to go this way.

4649
05:40:17,220 --> 05:40:20,120
I thought I would derink, but we're here, I guess.

4650
05:40:20,460 --> 05:40:20,780
We're here.

4651
05:40:24,380 --> 05:40:25,200
Yes, we're here.

4652
05:40:29,790 --> 05:40:31,050
No, we're not locked.

4653
05:40:31,330 --> 05:40:32,970
Okay, I wasn't throwing.

4654
05:40:33,310 --> 05:40:34,210
I wasn't throwing.

4655
05:40:35,130 --> 05:40:37,170
But hope is a lie.

4656
05:40:37,490 --> 05:40:41,750
Every time I start hoping, I'm just in for disappointment.

4657
05:40:42,090 --> 05:40:42,810
It's a lie.

4658
05:40:43,230 --> 05:40:46,790
But I used to be top 500 a long time ago.

4659
05:40:46,890 --> 05:40:48,390
And then I stopped trying.

4660
05:40:51,170 --> 05:40:54,830
I even forgot to charge my mouse mid-game.

4661
05:40:55,090 --> 05:40:56,530
Like three games ago.

4662
05:40:59,010 --> 05:41:06,270
oh yeah i've been and i had to like i had to play mantis with like fucked up cable

4663
05:41:09,330 --> 05:41:24,130
no i need to win three games i think i think three games secures it but i don't think there's a world where that could happen maybe like one universe in

4664
05:41:27,450 --> 05:41:34,070
Maybe one dokeybird in one universe out of the way that has had it.

4665
05:41:35,410 --> 05:41:37,450
Only, yeah, just only three games, guys.

4666
05:41:37,690 --> 05:41:39,110
It's so easy.

4667
05:41:42,330 --> 05:41:43,910
Dr. Strange has seen it.

4668
05:41:44,810 --> 05:41:50,470
It's just that one dokey is living the life right now.

4669
05:41:54,250 --> 05:41:56,150
1v1, join range.

4670
05:41:57,290 --> 05:41:59,010
Bro, how are we gonna 1v1?

4671
05:41:59,030 --> 05:42:01,870
You got top 10.

4672
05:42:05,130 --> 05:42:05,450
Bro.

4673
05:42:07,010 --> 05:42:07,730
You got...

4674
05:42:07,730 --> 05:42:08,890
This is like...

4675
05:42:08,890 --> 05:42:10,990
It's 4 in the morning here.

4676
05:42:11,310 --> 05:42:12,710
And I'm pretty sure it's like...

4677
05:42:12,710 --> 05:42:14,070
What time is it right now in Korea?

4678
05:42:14,890 --> 05:42:17,430
This is the only 1v1 I'll do.

4679
05:42:20,490 --> 05:42:26,990
This is the only 1v1 I'll do in the practice range.

4680
05:42:29,030 --> 05:42:52,450
i think he'll still beat me i think the most intense 1v1 in history where is he oh wait okay all right i'm ready cloak only

4681
05:42:56,430 --> 05:43:23,250
the only 1v1 that matters all right here we go here we go i'm gonna get my absolute shit kicked in but here we go cloak only i don't even know how a cloak 1v1 will work true test of skill it truly is This is a real test.

4682
05:43:23,930 --> 05:43:25,490
All right, how do we know when we start, though?

4683
05:43:26,010 --> 05:43:26,750
How do we know?

4684
05:43:27,970 --> 05:43:28,710
How do we know?

4685
05:43:28,850 --> 05:43:30,090
Oh, whoa, whoa.

4686
05:43:31,270 --> 05:43:32,270
Oh, oh.

4687
05:43:37,950 --> 05:43:39,090
Sorry, dang.

4688
05:43:39,430 --> 05:43:40,470
No, never mind.

4689
05:43:41,170 --> 05:43:42,210
Jesus Christ.

4690
05:43:42,570 --> 05:43:50,830
I swear to God, Rock, if we lose this game, I swear to God, if we lose this game.

4691
05:43:51,630 --> 05:44:08,490
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background Yeah, minus 35 Oh my god, Rocky go on streamer mode where where they're just gonna Even they don't know who they are look at the twitch directory

4692
05:44:13,010 --> 05:44:48,050

4695
05:45:27,570 --> 05:45:29,870
Oh, we have the iron fist or not.

4696
05:45:32,090 --> 05:45:33,510
He's very confident.

4697
05:45:33,670 --> 05:45:35,490
I'm ready to see this confidence.

4698
05:45:36,370 --> 05:45:40,210
Actually, I could go clo- um, we're gonna go cloaking.

4699
05:45:41,930 --> 05:45:43,190
I'm gonna go cloaking.

4700
05:45:43,530 --> 05:45:44,290
Oh wait, never mind.

4701
05:45:44,910 --> 05:45:45,650
Let's just go to this.

4702
05:45:46,030 --> 05:45:50,150
I was gonna go cloak and then we build all in get point really fast.

4703
05:45:50,750 --> 05:45:55,370
Because that's like, um, that's what you do for meta.

4704
05:45:55,670 --> 05:45:57,010
I don't know.

4705
05:45:57,690 --> 05:45:59,710
You can't deny that would be a hot ticket.

4706
05:46:01,350 --> 05:46:02,830
But I've always preferred the cold.

4707
05:46:03,350 --> 05:46:04,270
Alright, here we go.

4708
05:46:05,570 --> 05:46:07,570
The battle starts in five.

4709
05:46:08,210 --> 05:46:11,490
Four, three, two, one.

4710
05:46:12,570 --> 05:46:13,730
There we go.

4711
05:46:16,870 --> 05:46:17,330
Alright.

4712
05:46:18,490 --> 05:46:19,790
Oh, down we go.

4713
05:46:20,930 --> 05:46:22,110
Didn't get frozen.

4714
05:46:23,670 --> 05:46:25,190
Things are looking okay.

4715
05:46:30,450 --> 05:46:30,950
Okay.

4716
05:46:32,490 --> 05:46:33,670
We gotta make sure that...

4717
05:46:35,430 --> 05:46:37,330
Oh, they have Hawkeye, though.

4718
05:46:39,090 --> 05:46:39,770
They have Hawkeye.

4719
05:46:39,830 --> 05:46:40,690
I'm a little scared.

4720
05:46:40,810 --> 05:46:41,970
Because you can get one shot.

4721
05:46:42,990 --> 05:46:43,770
Hey, Strange!

4722
05:46:43,850 --> 05:46:44,730
Could you let...

4723
05:46:44,730 --> 05:46:46,130
You know...

4724
05:46:46,670 --> 05:46:47,590
Not do that?

4725
05:46:48,730 --> 05:46:50,170
Oh, that's fine.

4726
05:46:51,330 --> 05:46:52,970
Oh, that's not fine.

4727
05:46:54,410 --> 05:46:55,650
Oh, I should have went and run.

4728
05:46:55,670 --> 05:46:56,010
rocket.

4729
05:46:56,370 --> 05:46:58,030
Oh, no, actually, I'm glad I didn't go rocket.

4730
05:47:01,490 --> 05:47:02,770
How do we heal that?

4731
05:47:02,850 --> 05:47:03,770
What do you mean?

4732
05:47:04,310 --> 05:47:05,150
Guys, what happened?

4733
05:47:05,370 --> 05:47:09,750
He said he said he said things would be different.

4734
05:47:12,610 --> 05:47:16,870
He was so confident about his fucking he was so confident.

4735
05:47:16,950 --> 05:47:18,830
Oh, what happened to the office?

4736
05:47:19,410 --> 05:47:19,530
What?

4737
05:47:22,130 --> 05:47:25,490
I don't understand what happened to the office.

4738
05:47:25,670 --> 05:47:28,070
Bro, I don't know what happened.

4739
05:47:28,650 --> 05:47:29,950
I thought you were him.

4740
05:47:30,710 --> 05:47:32,630
I thought you were him, bro

4741
05:47:35,750 --> 05:47:41,850
I'm gonna use this bucket There you go.

4742
05:47:42,030 --> 05:47:47,010
Okay, and that's why I'm not tweaking this though What?

05:47:47,730 --> 05:47:49,810
Okay, this sucks.

05:47:50,010 --> 05:47:51,050
This is so what?

4745

Oh my god, I got double stunned guys i don't think he's him guys guys i don't think it's where uh okay um

4747
05:48:27,450 --> 05:48:28,390
It's over for them.

4748
05:48:28,890 --> 05:48:30,930
I knew it was over for us.

4749
05:48:31,210 --> 05:48:33,050
Did he miss the graph?

4750
05:48:34,650 --> 05:48:36,450
Okay, that's fine.

4751
05:48:42,270 --> 05:48:46,490
All right, it was over for us.

4752
05:48:47,130 --> 05:48:48,310
It really is.

4753
05:48:49,790 --> 05:48:51,210
It really is.

4754
05:48:53,810 --> 05:48:54,530
Hello.

4755
05:48:54,810 --> 05:48:55,490
That's much better.

4756
05:48:55,990 --> 05:48:56,750
Hello, team.

4757
05:48:57,170 --> 05:48:57,550
Hello.

4758
05:49:04,700 --> 05:49:08,620
It might be over for us, buddy.

4759
05:49:09,180 --> 05:49:10,300
It really is.

4760
05:49:14,640 --> 05:49:16,740
Oh my god.

4761
05:49:17,640 --> 05:49:20,240
Now he's on, now he's on Panther.

4762
05:49:24,360 --> 05:49:26,440
Maybe we shouldn't have Q Dodge.

4763
05:49:32,370 --> 05:49:33,370
Oh my god.

4764
05:49:33,510 --> 05:49:34,910
I thought she would kill me.

4765
05:49:40,700 --> 05:49:41,760
That's okay.

4766
05:49:43,020 --> 05:49:46,060
Sometimes they give us and they take us away.

4767
05:49:47,100 --> 05:49:48,420
It's just be like that.

4768
05:49:49,680 --> 05:49:52,100
It really, it really do be like that.

4769
05:49:52,960 --> 05:49:54,760
I can't move.

4770
05:49:58,400 --> 05:50:02,260
I think it's also we only have literally one.

4771
05:50:02,380 --> 05:50:04,260

What are you guys doing?

4777
05:51:02,770 --> 05:51:06,310
I think I'm going to actually devote with this game.

4778
05:51:11,210 --> 05:51:14,250
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

4779
05:51:14,590 --> 05:51:16,750
The right heroes could make all the difference.

4780

4785
05:52:34,690 --> 05:52:35,910
I knew it was over.

4787
05:52:49,260 --> 05:52:50,620

Goodbye.

4789
05:52:52,080 --> 05:52:53,780

05:53:06,780 --> 05:53:07,640
No,

4794
05:53:13,470 --> 05:53:14,210

4795
05:53:14,210 --> 05:53:15,250
No, it was the...

4796
05:53:15,250 --> 05:53:18,030
It was the Iron Fist.

4797
05:53:18,270 --> 05:53:20,530

4798
05:53:23,630 --> 05:53:24,770
Oh, bro!

4799
05:53:26,390 --> 05:53:29,050
Bro, this guy has no idea who he's talking to.

4800
05:53:29,770 --> 05:53:30,490
That's...

4801
05:53:30,490 --> 05:53:33,230
Look at you, the goat fat.

4802
05:53:33,370 --> 05:53:34,610
Oh, my God.

4803
05:53:34,790 --> 05:53:38,290
It's all bullshit.

4804
05:53:42,210 --> 05:53:43,970
It's actually crazy.

4805
05:53:45,090 --> 05:53:46,610

4806
05:53:47,230 --> 05:53:49,030

4809
05:53:57,270 --> 05:53:58,250

4813
05:55:02,020 --> 05:55:08,540
Bro, you really have an ego if Grandmaster 1 as your career highest?

4814
05:55:09,140 --> 05:55:11,980
You never even hit Celestial!

4815
05:55:12,680 --> 05:55:13,980
Holy shit!

4816
05:55:14,440 --> 05:55:15,660
He has played five!

4817
05:55:15,820 --> 05:55:17,040
Wait, how much have I played?

4818
05:55:19,000 --> 05:55:22,900
Bro, okay, Ian, okay, that's crazy.

4819
05:55:23,660 --> 05:55:26,240
That's actually crazy.

4820
05:55:33,540 --> 05:55:36,020
He actually peaked a GM.

4821
05:55:37,880 --> 05:55:42,620
He has never even hit Celestial in his entire life.

4822
05:55:45,260 --> 05:55:50,120
The fact that his entire life he hasn't hit it is wild.

4823
05:55:51,680 --> 05:55:52,180
Where is he?

4824
05:55:52,260 --> 05:55:52,880
Okay, here we go.

4825
05:55:52,960 --> 05:55:54,180
How do we start the match?

4826
05:55:55,360 --> 05:55:56,640
The real gatekeeper.

4827
05:55:56,880 --> 05:55:57,840
All right, here we go.

4828
05:55:58,200 --> 05:55:58,780
All right, ready?

4829
05:56:07,180 --> 05:56:08,800
Oh, he's going full.

4830
05:56:08,880 --> 05:56:10,200
Look, where are you?

4831
05:56:11,280 --> 05:56:12,580
I'm sorry, I've been...

4832
05:56:12,920 --> 05:56:14,760
I meant that cloak, sorry.

4833
05:56:15,700 --> 05:56:16,920
Cloak and...

4834
05:56:18,360 --> 05:56:19,180
And...

4835
05:56:23,700 --> 05:56:24,520
And...

4836
05:56:24,520 --> 05:56:25,920
Okay.

4837
05:56:27,280 --> 05:56:28,920
Let's do it.

4838
05:56:30,000 --> 05:56:31,680
He was a cheater.

4839
05:56:33,060 --> 05:56:37,200
What are you doing?

4840
05:56:40,580 --> 05:56:41,400
No!

4841
05:56:42,620 --> 05:56:42,800
Wait!

4842
05:56:43,020 --> 05:56:44,080
Holy shit, what?

4843
05:56:44,860 --> 05:56:45,700
What did he do?

4844
05:56:45,840 --> 05:56:46,220
Oh wait.

4845
05:56:50,780 --> 05:56:51,520
Oh my god.

4846
05:56:51,760 --> 05:56:51,780
Oh.

4847
05:56:58,930 --> 05:56:59,610
Oh my god.

4848
05:57:00,010 --> 05:57:00,170
No.

4849
05:57:00,370 --> 05:57:01,010
No, I almost had it.

4850
05:57:03,220 --> 05:57:03,580
It's a gaming.

4851
05:57:04,060 --> 05:57:04,600
Holy shit.

4852
05:57:04,760 --> 05:57:05,240
I told you.

4853
05:57:09,840 --> 05:57:11,900
It's top 10 for a reason.

4854
05:57:13,080 --> 05:57:14,100
Oh, I didn't have it.

4855
05:57:14,160 --> 05:57:15,020
I didn't have my thing.

4856
05:57:15,100 --> 05:57:15,720
Wait, give me a sec.

4857
05:57:15,980 --> 05:57:16,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4858
05:57:16,620 --> 05:57:17,600
I didn't have my cooldowns.

4859
05:57:17,720 --> 05:57:18,920
I didn't have my cooldowns.

4860
05:57:19,400 --> 05:57:21,240
Bro, why is Bro losing?

4861
05:57:21,700 --> 05:57:22,760
It's game bro.

4862
05:57:22,880 --> 05:57:24,660
This guy is top 10, bro.

4863
05:57:24,940 --> 05:57:26,840
That's a fucking insane game sense!

4864
05:57:27,280 --> 05:57:28,140
Alright, here we go.

4865
05:57:28,320 --> 05:57:29,220
Wait, I need a full heal.

4866
05:57:29,800 --> 05:57:30,360
Fuck it.

4867
05:57:30,560 --> 05:57:31,240
Give me a second.

4868
05:57:31,940 --> 05:57:32,940
And then...

4869
05:57:34,860 --> 05:57:35,320
Alright.

4870
05:57:38,850 --> 05:57:39,310
Alright.

4871
05:57:40,570 --> 05:57:41,030
Yeah.

4872
05:57:42,450 --> 05:57:42,910
Alright.

4873
05:57:44,370 --> 05:57:45,410
Alright, here we go.

4874
05:57:45,670 --> 05:57:47,270
Do what, before he's gonna fuck me up.

4875
05:57:47,390 --> 05:57:47,490
Get ready.

4876
05:57:54,070 --> 05:57:56,230
How is bro losing?

4877
05:57:56,310 --> 05:58:11,130
I don't understand his brain is bigger than my he's Korean his brain is vegetable right now

4878
05:58:17,030 --> 05:58:27,890
I'm I almost failed math what do you want I almost failed math I am a failed math I am a failure of an Asian.

4879
05:58:30,050 --> 05:58:31,890
I'm a banana.

4880
05:58:33,310 --> 05:58:34,630
I'm a banana.

4881
05:58:35,150 --> 05:58:36,450
I'm yellow on the outside.

4882
05:58:37,730 --> 05:58:38,650
White on the inside.

4883
05:58:38,990 --> 05:58:40,710
This guy is full Asian.

4884
05:58:40,850 --> 05:58:42,770
He fucking lives in Korea.

4885
05:58:44,390 --> 05:58:47,010
He lives in Korea.

4886
05:58:47,570 --> 05:58:48,990
His brain is massive.

4887
05:58:49,390 --> 05:58:53,610
My brain is dumb vegetable soup from

4888
05:58:58,160 --> 05:59:00,040
Also from, like, staying up too much.

4889
05:59:04,800 --> 05:59:06,600
He's also a pro.

4890
05:59:11,940 --> 05:59:14,120
I'm a failure of an Asian.

4891
05:59:16,400 --> 05:59:19,740
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

4892
05:59:20,140 --> 05:59:21,460
I literally almost failed.

4893
05:59:21,500 --> 05:59:22,800
I almost failed math.

4894
05:59:23,340 --> 05:59:25,680
And I had so many tutors, too.

4895
05:59:29,010 --> 05:59:30,030
Do we have...

4896
05:59:30,030 --> 05:59:30,550
Guys, do we...

4897
05:59:30,550 --> 05:59:31,250
Oh, my God.

4898
05:59:31,330 --> 05:59:32,470
Do we have red souls?

4899
05:59:32,530 --> 05:59:38,510
Do we have red pills again?

4900
05:59:44,160 --> 05:59:49,860
There is, that is the only reason anyone would ever do a Thor ban.

4901
05:59:53,340 --> 05:59:56,080
Oh my god, life is so cruel.

4902
05:59:57,800 --> 05:59:58,720
That's okay.

4903
05:59:59,740 --> 06:00:00,720
Red Queen is good.

4904
06:00:01,380 --> 06:00:02,460
It's a little heal here.

4905
06:00:02,700 --> 06:00:03,860
You can stop migraines.

4906
06:00:04,060 --> 06:00:05,620
What manner of creature are.

4907
06:00:05,720 --> 06:00:35,920

Never believe in anything.

4909
06:00:42,800 --> 06:00:46,120
Oh, and then they go Wolverine because they were already stream sniping.

4910
06:00:48,860 --> 06:00:50,760
That's crazy that they're stream sniping him.

4911
06:00:51,520 --> 06:00:52,700
When you can just open.

4912
06:00:54,560 --> 06:00:56,420
When you just open my stream.

4913
06:01:03,160 --> 06:01:04,680
Oh, we can't find us that.

4914
06:01:04,740 --> 06:01:05,480
We're three tanks.

4915
06:01:06,560 --> 06:01:09,080
I'm just a fucking poor little raccoon.

4916
06:01:10,860 --> 06:01:12,400
That's all I can do.

4917
06:01:16,990 --> 06:01:17,250
Alright.

4918
06:01:22,170 --> 06:01:23,470
There we go.

4919
06:01:24,450 --> 06:01:26,230
This is very good gameplay, guys.

4920
06:01:26,370 --> 06:01:27,290
We're almost there.

4921
06:01:27,470 --> 06:01:29,010
We're almost there.

4922
06:01:29,410 --> 06:01:31,770
We're almost to the promise, lad.

4923
06:01:32,630 --> 06:01:33,030
Look at that.

4924
06:01:33,110 --> 06:01:34,590
Just a little guy.

4925
06:01:36,470 --> 06:01:38,850
Making the easiest game of my life.

4926
06:01:43,910 --> 06:01:44,510

06:02:16,870 --> 06:02:19,550
I haven't let go of right click yet.

4930
06:02:21,450 --> 06:02:21,750
Oh.

4931
06:02:23,150 --> 06:02:24,190
That's embarrassing.

4932
06:02:25,690 --> 06:02:26,190
Good for...

4933
06:02:26,190 --> 06:02:26,450
You know what?

4934
06:02:26,490 --> 06:02:26,970
He tried.

4935
06:02:27,130 --> 06:02:27,810
It's good for him.

4936
06:02:27,910 --> 06:02:28,370
He tried.

4937
06:02:29,870 --> 06:02:31,250
You know, good effort.

4938
06:02:31,990 --> 06:02:33,470
Does this damage my thing?

4939
06:02:33,850 --> 06:02:35,570
Oh my god, it does.

4940
06:02:35,810 --> 06:02:36,530
Oh, it's fine.

4941
06:02:37,890 --> 06:02:38,270
Yay.

4942
06:02:39,510 --> 06:02:40,750
Let me just stand here.

4943
06:02:41,110 --> 06:02:42,810
I'm on my Uber ride right now.

4944
06:02:43,190 --> 06:02:44,370
I caught my Uber.

4945
06:02:49,450 --> 06:02:49,890
Yay!

4946
06:02:51,290 --> 06:02:52,310
Bro, I don't even need a dodge.

4947
06:02:54,030 --> 06:02:54,910
Don't even need a dodge.

4948
06:02:55,050 --> 06:02:56,010
I literally just have to...

4949
06:02:56,010 --> 06:02:59,710
Oh, that's a lot of us.

4950
06:03:00,890 --> 06:03:02,030
Oh, I should...

4951
06:03:02,030 --> 06:03:03,450
I'm gonna put this closer, actually.

4952
06:03:04,570 --> 06:03:04,970
There we go.

4953
06:03:06,010 --> 06:03:07,010
I'll put it closer.

4954
06:03:08,610 --> 06:03:09,930
Oh, I forgot how to...

4955
06:03:09,930 --> 06:03:11,110
Oh, I should not have altered.

4956
06:03:11,790 --> 06:03:14,330
I legitimately thought there would be more people.

4957
06:03:15,790 --> 06:03:18,170
Did they have another res, maybe?

4958
06:03:19,470 --> 06:03:19,990
Hello, everyone.

4959
06:03:20,210 --> 06:03:20,790
Just barrel stuff them.

4960
06:03:20,990 --> 06:03:21,410
Barrel stuff them.

4961
06:03:21,590 --> 06:03:22,150
Why are we...

4962
06:03:22,150 --> 06:03:22,830
Barrel stuff them.

4963
06:03:22,990 --> 06:03:23,850
Barrel stuff them.

4964
06:03:23,870 --> 06:03:24,490
Why are we...

4965
06:03:24,490 --> 06:03:25,610
Don't let them throw!

4966
06:03:27,910 --> 06:03:28,470
Bro!

4967
06:03:28,850 --> 06:03:29,710
Oh, my God.

4968
06:03:35,170 --> 06:03:35,990
It's okay.

4969
06:03:36,890 --> 06:03:37,930
Watch this.

4970
06:03:39,770 --> 06:03:40,850
I have high ground.

4971
06:03:41,530 --> 06:03:42,010
Oh, shit!

4972
06:03:43,430 --> 06:03:45,510
I still have high ground.

4973
06:03:45,830 --> 06:03:46,310
I...

4974
06:03:48,590 --> 06:03:52,470
See, now you know why I don't like Rocket One Trick.

4975
06:03:52,570 --> 06:03:53,530
I literally...

4976
06:03:53,530 --> 06:04:00,590
You guys saw the gameplay I had to do as Luna and Invis, and then Rocket.

4977
06:04:00,990 --> 06:04:02,150
I'm literally just...

4978
06:04:02,150 --> 06:04:03,250
I'm just chilling.

4979
06:04:03,950 --> 06:04:05,270
Let me just stand over here.

4980
06:04:05,370 --> 06:04:08,290
Until I kill like someone finds me, then I'm not chilling.

4981
06:04:08,630 --> 06:04:10,090
But it's so chill.

4982
06:04:10,150 --> 06:04:11,010
I deserve this.

4983
06:04:11,330 --> 06:04:12,730
I actually do deserve this.

4984
06:04:12,990 --> 06:04:15,090
This is how majority of Rocket One Trick's play, too.

4985
06:04:15,110 --> 06:04:15,990
That's the worst part.

4986
06:04:15,990 --> 06:04:18,350
All right, do you have fun?

4987
06:04:19,210 --> 06:04:22,750
I mean, it's nice to relax right now, honestly.

4988
06:04:23,110 --> 06:04:23,870
Is this Resume?

4989
06:04:24,130 --> 06:04:24,670
Yeah, it does.

4990
06:04:32,070 --> 06:04:33,110
Oh, shit.

4991
06:04:33,870 --> 06:04:34,090
Whoops.

4992
06:04:35,010 --> 06:04:35,750
That's unlucky.

4993
06:04:37,350 --> 06:04:39,030
Oh, they're resetting now.

4994
06:04:39,550 --> 06:04:39,930
Oh, goodbye.

4995
06:04:40,610 --> 06:04:41,530
I'll just leave.

4996
06:04:43,090 --> 06:04:45,810
I'll leave and grab my health charge and then I'll be gone.

4997
06:04:45,990 --> 06:04:47,050
Oh, goodbye.

4998
06:04:49,690 --> 06:04:49,890
Yay.

4999
06:04:51,770 --> 06:04:53,290
Oh my god, goodbye.

5000
06:04:54,390 --> 06:04:55,970
Got my arch all charged.

5001
06:04:57,270 --> 06:04:58,110
Wait, thank you.

5002
06:04:58,350 --> 06:05:02,690
If I have to restress everyone else, this has to be stressed too.

5003
06:05:04,550 --> 06:05:05,610
Okay, I can...

5004
06:05:07,690 --> 06:05:08,590
That's fine.

5005
06:05:08,950 --> 06:05:09,870
Oh, what the fuck?

5006
06:05:09,970 --> 06:05:11,350
No, get away from me.

5007
06:05:11,930 --> 06:05:13,910
Can't nobody mind control me?

5008
06:05:14,390 --> 06:05:15,130
I'm a raccoon.

5009
06:05:18,390 --> 06:05:18,830
Yay!

5010
06:05:20,070 --> 06:05:21,390
Can we kill this?

5011
06:05:22,650 --> 06:05:23,610
There it is, it should be fine.

5012
06:05:23,890 --> 06:05:25,490
Bro, why are you standing there, bro?

5013
06:05:26,190 --> 06:05:27,210
There you go.

5014
06:05:29,750 --> 06:05:30,070
Yay!

5015
06:05:30,930 --> 06:05:32,210
Oh, you're really down the door.

5016
06:05:32,310 --> 06:05:33,810
You're like my favorite door player, too.

5017
06:05:35,770 --> 06:05:38,350
It is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to him.

5018
06:05:38,710 --> 06:05:41,090
I've seen so many people yell at this guy.

5019
06:05:41,550 --> 06:05:42,570
It's like really cool.

5020
06:05:42,670 --> 06:05:43,370
They double support.

5021
06:05:43,530 --> 06:05:44,570
Oh my god, they...

5022
06:05:45,990 --> 06:06:33,890
with support on it like I wish I was joking I've heard so many people rage at red drills all right I got high ground what you gonna do about that yay EOMM gizif and EOMM take it free my hood time to switch things up including which side you're on zero zero 90 look this is not a button i'm not here to do damage guys

5023
06:06:37,090 --> 06:07:15,170
hey but i have 19 assists though oh wait i did 51 damage with my 11 accuracy guys that's so hot right now is that isn't that hot guys what does animal crossing do there's a reason why people play animal crossing is when they're people when the enemy team is going full dive me night so they fucking done my story knows it's me so like when i was like what did you say so you knew that had to go so when you play animal crossing uh Basically,

5024
06:07:15,470 --> 06:07:30,930
like, dive characters can't do anything to the supports Because our heads are so... We're so tiny Me and a Jeff are so fucking small And we can just run around, like, jumping, crawling everywhere That there's no point in diving us Because we can literally be like this And be like,

5025
06:07:31,230 --> 06:07:41,050
wee And then be like, meow So there's no, like, there's no actual backline We just run around and chill And just hang.

5026
06:07:41,150 --> 06:07:41,850
See, look at that.

5027
06:07:42,250 --> 06:07:43,250
How are you gonna dive a shark?

5028
06:07:43,370 --> 06:08:17,410
Look at, he just swims away like actually i i even established that but that was so useless that is so useless literally that's what i mean there's like oh they're doing animal crossing too but the thing is it doesn't matter like we don't we're not running that oh look at that look see i got shot at i run away.

5029
06:08:19,750 --> 06:08:21,310
Aim for effort.

5030
06:08:24,830 --> 06:08:29,290
See, literally, literally what's the point of diving us?

5031
06:08:30,350 --> 06:08:32,470
He has to dive like...

5032
06:08:32,470 --> 06:08:34,390
Oh my god, he almost diving.

5033
06:08:34,750 --> 06:08:40,730
He has to dive like other, like others, the DPS or some shit, because he can't do shit to us.

5034
06:08:43,550 --> 06:08:47,150
Yeah, they're playing dive and counter dive, but like none Buster die.

5035
06:08:47,530 --> 06:08:58,590
We're like, literally just gonna... The only issue about Animal Crossing is that the heals are not as strong as obviously not as strong as the other supports.

5036
06:08:59,270 --> 06:09:00,650
But at least we're not getting though.

5037
06:09:01,490 --> 06:09:05,210
And we can heal when we're getting died because venom they can't do shit.

5038
06:09:05,870 --> 06:09:07,010
I'm just chilling.

5039
06:09:10,610 --> 06:09:10,670
Yeah.

5040
06:09:13,730 --> 06:09:48,030
The people are like, get off Rocket right now it's sort of like outdated knowledge but like also it depends on like the situation to be fair there's five like what is he gonna do like what is that guy gonna do he's like my little weak ass tentacles is gonna fix this look guys i got it too 1 0 28 It's ruined now.

5041
06:09:48,830 --> 06:09:50,110
Report this venom.

5042
06:09:52,430 --> 06:09:53,810
No, the perfect...

5043
06:09:53,810 --> 06:09:54,830
Wait, did the venom in the game?

5044
06:09:56,470 --> 06:09:59,670
To be fair, he's trying to dive a Jeff and a rocket.

5045
06:10:00,070 --> 06:10:04,610
That's pretty fucking... I also think he's not trying anymore, honestly.

5046
06:10:06,090 --> 06:10:08,610
I don't think he is trying, to be fair.

5047
06:10:08,950 --> 06:10:10,070
I hear a Star Lord.

5048
06:10:11,710 --> 06:10:12,570
Or is he...

5049
06:10:12,570 --> 06:10:13,930
What is he trying to do?

5050
06:10:14,990 --> 06:10:18,090
Is he just What is the star they're doing?

5051
06:10:18,810 --> 06:10:19,710
Holy shit.

5052
06:10:23,170 --> 06:10:25,830
Look, yeah, all you can do is dive our hell out.

5053
06:10:28,810 --> 06:10:30,030
And it's working.

5054
06:10:33,170 --> 06:10:33,370
See?

5055
06:10:34,290 --> 06:10:36,110
What can they do?

5056
06:10:37,730 --> 06:10:38,210
Disappear!

5057
06:10:39,750 --> 06:10:40,710
Who did...

5058
06:10:40,710 --> 06:10:41,450
What did he get?

5059
06:10:42,810 --> 06:10:43,670
Oh my god!

5060
06:10:44,030 --> 06:10:44,650
Oh my god!

5061
06:10:44,930 --> 06:10:45,430
Oh my god!

5062
06:10:45,530 --> 06:10:46,110
You got...

5063
06:10:46,130 --> 06:10:47,410
Two tanks and a DP...

5064
06:10:47,410 --> 06:10:50,510
You got a tank and a DPS and a Rocky Raccoon?

5065
06:10:53,670 --> 06:10:55,210
Like, look at this.

5066
06:10:55,770 --> 06:10:57,210
That is so sad.

5067
06:10:58,990 --> 06:10:59,710
That...

5068
06:10:59,710 --> 06:11:04,270
That is so sad.

5069
06:11:05,030 --> 06:11:06,070
Never miss.

5070
06:11:06,990 --> 06:11:09,590
This is real firepower.

5071
06:11:09,990 --> 06:11:12,210
He tried so hard, man.

5072
06:11:12,790 --> 06:11:13,830
All you...

5073
06:11:13,830 --> 06:11:14,750
What the fuck?

5074
06:11:17,190 --> 06:11:20,650
Oh, this is bad for me now, but it's okay.

5075
06:11:20,890 --> 06:11:21,590
Oh, shit!

5076
06:11:21,950 --> 06:11:22,110
Oh!

5077
06:11:28,740 --> 06:11:34,480
They brought the dice, bro, the only way to beat us.

5078
06:11:35,660 --> 06:11:36,820
Wait, we're...

5079
06:11:36,820 --> 06:11:38,020
We're...

5080
06:11:38,020 --> 06:11:39,440
Oh my god, it's over.

5081
06:11:39,820 --> 06:11:42,640
Okay, this TP fucking sucks, guys.

5082
06:11:44,280 --> 06:11:46,220
What the fuck is this TP?

5083
06:11:47,840 --> 06:11:49,240
But also, look at this girl.

5084
06:11:49,420 --> 06:11:51,000
Look at me and Jeff go though.

5085
06:11:51,380 --> 06:11:52,180
Whoa, look at that.

5086
06:11:52,600 --> 06:11:54,080
Okay, we should get our point though.

5087
06:11:56,060 --> 06:11:57,920
Okay, we lived it so long.

5088
06:11:58,020 --> 06:11:59,220
We should not live that long.

5089
06:12:03,100 --> 06:12:05,800
The natural counter that was just bring a gun.

5090
06:12:10,940 --> 06:12:12,940
That's why you're buffing stuff.

5091
06:12:13,500 --> 06:12:16,340
No, we spend them does not need more buffs chat.

5092
06:12:17,260 --> 06:12:17,940
We're fine.

5093
06:12:19,440 --> 06:12:20,660
Free my hood.

5094
06:12:21,020 --> 06:12:22,120
It's gotta go back to...

5095
06:12:22,120 --> 06:12:22,260
Oh.

5096
06:12:24,400 --> 06:12:25,980
Oh, that's awkward.

5097
06:12:28,000 --> 06:12:30,140

5100
06:12:32,360 --> 06:12:33,720
Oh my god, Rocket is still alive.

5101
06:12:34,860 --> 06:12:36,000
I didn't realize that.

5102
06:12:36,040 --> 06:12:37,100
What the fuck is he doing?

5103
06:12:37,180 --> 06:12:38,520
Who is he fighting over there?

5104
06:12:38,560 --> 06:12:39,600
His fucking demons?

5105
06:12:40,640 --> 06:12:44,000
I'm just looking at my side, trying to figure out what he's doing.

5106
06:12:44,940 --> 06:12:45,380

i'm back i'm back everybody i'm having fun though maybe i should have just been streaming my rival's grand maybe maybe i've been streaming the entire time it wouldn't maybe i could have got there a lot sooner maybe i could have actually got it it helps with this it's because i play better off stream you see me make a lot of fucking mistakes though i i do play a lot better off stream than i do on stream and also like you guys saw those moments where i had like 70 frames when the fucking strange portal opened like yeah you guys saw that right it got yeah it doesn't happen when i'm off stream but it's definitely a lot less frustrating

5140
06:18:23,410 --> 06:18:24,450
Let me...

5141
06:18:24,450 --> 06:18:25,230
I'm Pedro Pascal.

5142
06:18:26,150 --> 06:18:29,410
But the best thing I ever built was my family.

5143
06:18:30,770 --> 06:18:30,810
Damn.

5144
06:18:32,390 --> 06:18:33,750
That's hard for Pedro.

5145
06:18:34,670 --> 06:18:35,590
Mr. Fantastic.

5146
06:18:35,970 --> 06:18:36,190
Hello.

5147
06:18:36,890 --> 06:18:37,870

5148
06:18:43,170 --> 06:18:46,250
He's got...

5149
06:18:46,250 --> 06:18:47,850
Wait, how do I do it?

5150
06:18:49,190 --> 06:18:49,710
Damage.

5151
06:18:50,750 --> 06:18:52,450
Oh, that's how I do it.

5152
06:18:52,570 --> 06:18:53,350
Okay, I got it.

5153
06:18:55,170 --> 06:18:55,930

5154
06:18:57,570 --> 06:18:58,450
Get over here!

5155
06:19:04,370 --> 06:19:05,930
Alright, go ahead.

5156
06:19:13,500 --> 06:19:14,760
Stop you.

5157
06:19:19,800 --> 06:19:22,920
I'm a menace to this- Oh shit, I'm sorry.

5158
06:19:23,560 --> 06:19:24,100
Misclick.

5159
06:19:24,440 --> 06:19:25,540
It was a misclick.

5160
06:19:26,780 --> 06:19:28,820
No one's safe from Pedro Pascal.

5161
06:19:33,040 --> 06:19:46,160
quietly leaves no one's safe not even myself not the tree call HR

5163
06:20:30,170 --> 06:20:31,810
Why they do this to me?

5164
06:20:33,290 --> 06:20:35,630
I've been a positive impact in the community.

5165
06:20:35,790 --> 06:20:41,630
That's what they said I deserve nice things.

5166
06:20:46,390 --> 06:20:47,090
Why magic?

5167
06:20:47,310 --> 06:20:49,270
Is there someone playing magic on the enemy team?

5168
06:20:49,410 --> 06:20:50,290
Because why the fuck?

5169
06:20:50,390 --> 06:20:51,450
Oh, wow.

5170
06:20:52,690 --> 06:20:54,050
They target ban the mat.

5171
06:20:55,150 --> 06:20:56,190
That's crazy.

5172
06:20:57,330 --> 06:20:58,290
Banning torch.

5173
06:20:58,470 --> 06:20:59,010
I don't care.

5174
06:21:00,090 --> 06:21:00,550
Venom?

5175
06:21:01,370 --> 06:21:02,270
Bro, I'm not gonna...

5176
06:21:02,270 --> 06:21:03,530
I don't wanna play...

5177
06:21:03,530 --> 06:21:03,950
Penny?

5178
06:21:05,970 --> 06:21:07,290
Bro, what kind of...

5179
06:21:07,290 --> 06:21:08,670
Who are you fighting?

5180
06:21:09,350 --> 06:21:09,910
Who?

5181
06:21:10,130 --> 06:21:12,070
Who are we fighting?

5182
06:21:16,650 --> 06:21:21,730
Who the fuck is on the enemy team to have all these bands?

5183
06:21:30,400 --> 06:21:31,780
I will bring peace to this universe.

5184
06:21:32,040 --> 06:21:33,540
I'm so confused.

5185
06:21:33,840 --> 06:21:34,360
I'm Luna Snow.

5186
06:21:35,140 --> 06:21:37,460
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

5187
06:21:37,760 --> 06:21:38,800
His demons.

5188
06:21:40,000 --> 06:21:40,380
Oh.

5189
06:21:41,020 --> 06:21:44,040
Of course this is my minus 25 game.

5190
06:21:53,140 --> 06:21:56,120
I gained 17, I lose 25.

5191
06:21:56,320 --> 06:21:59,020
This life really is.

5192
06:21:59,480 --> 06:22:00,000
Round one!

5193
06:22:00,300 --> 06:22:01,500
Music makes people happy.

5194
06:22:02,160 --> 06:22:03,180
Heroes make them safe.

5195
06:22:03,900 --> 06:22:05,120
Maybe I can do both.

5196
06:22:07,760 --> 06:22:09,000
Why is he on Jeff?

5197
06:22:10,980 --> 06:22:14,500
I mean, why- I'm sorry, he should be on Jeff, but why did he throw himself off the cliff?

5198
06:22:14,560 --> 06:22:16,260
There's so much to live for right now.

5199
06:22:18,060 --> 06:22:18,940
Yeah, so...

5200
06:22:21,120 --> 06:22:21,980
Wait, is he throwing?

5201
06:22:22,260 --> 06:22:24,360
You are the winter soldier, aren't you?

5202
06:22:30,870 --> 06:22:32,770
How are we supposed to know that?

5203
06:22:32,770 --> 06:22:33,230
How?

5204
06:22:34,270 --> 06:22:38,330
How were we supposed to know that, though?

5205
06:22:43,480 --> 06:22:47,880
Maybe just don't touch the fan when you GM?

5206
06:22:48,680 --> 06:22:50,920
Oh my god.

5207
06:22:52,760 --> 06:22:53,820
Someone, you!

5208
06:22:54,220 --> 06:22:58,120
I mean, I mean, I can just...

5209
06:22:58,120 --> 06:23:00,540
Alright, we'll just report him to the devs.

5210
06:23:01,060 --> 06:23:01,300
Honestly.

5211
06:23:01,600 --> 06:23:03,600
We can just report this guy to the devs.

5212
06:23:05,800 --> 06:23:06,840
Just leave, man.

5213
06:23:07,020 --> 06:23:07,260
Okay.

5214
06:23:08,660 --> 06:23:09,000

5215
06:23:11,260 --> 06:23:11,740

5217
06:23:16,740 --> 06:23:17,940
Oh, he's streamer mode.

5218
06:23:18,120 --> 06:23:19,880

5219
06:23:20,020 --> 06:23:21,240

5221
06:23:22,680 --> 06:23:25,060
No, this guy is actually at win trading.

5222
06:23:26,280 --> 06:23:28,260
And then the fucking guy was like, oh.

5223
06:23:28,680 --> 06:23:30,940
I have a 94% win rate.

5224
06:23:31,280 --> 06:23:32,780
Maybe don't control the bands when you...

5225
06:23:32,780 --> 06:23:33,660
And I'm like, bro!

5226
06:23:34,520 --> 06:23:38,280
Me and bedtime is Celestia 1 on his main.

5227

That's wild.

5231
06:23:51,960 --> 06:23:53,620

06:23:54,160 --> 06:23:55,240

Actual.

5247
06:25:39,830 --> 06:26:09,090
as i was told by other pros that blessed was a hacker um because it was a huge debate and then he finally got like fully banned on his main and then every time he makes an alt account to boost her or play with her i don't know um those alt accounts get banned because like my friends will report it and then um i once were i won't not accidentally i once reported once one of the counts too and it also got bad

5248

5287
06:31:33,480 --> 06:31:36,060
Who am I going to banish from this match?

5288
06:31:36,880 --> 06:31:37,720

5289
06:31:39,480 --> 06:31:50,500
But, like, for those who didn't know, weren't in the members, throwing himself off as Jeff Maltz multiple times for during game.

5290
06:31:54,240 --> 06:31:54,940
See, look at it!

5291
06:31:55,280 --> 06:31:55,880
Human torch!

5292
06:31:56,500 --> 06:31:56,760
Wow!

5293
06:31:57,740 --> 06:31:58,420
Human torch!

5294
06:32:04,620 --> 06:32:04,960
Like...

5295
06:32:06,940 --> 06:32:11,160
No, okay, so, um...

5296
06:32:11,160 --> 06:32:20,760
We were playing a game, I was in this rap game, it was like a month or two ago, and I was due to someone, but like, we were both on streamer mode, and they were on an alt account.

5297
06:32:21,600 --> 06:32:24,860
So like, but the alt account was like my, like, it was the same rank as main.

5298
06:32:25,280 --> 06:32:27,380
And they just didn't want to play on the main.

5299
06:32:28,320 --> 06:32:34,980
And, you know, because, like, they don't want to lose their main elo right now.

5300
06:32:36,120 --> 06:32:37,700
Sadly, it can't be like that.

5301
06:32:38,100 --> 06:32:40,300
But, oh, we have four support players.

5302
06:32:40,700 --> 06:32:41,340
That's unlucky.

5303
06:32:42,360 --> 06:32:42,960
Oh, nice.

5304
06:32:46,300 --> 06:32:53,080
But, basically, my duo doesn't like her.

5305
06:32:55,280 --> 06:33:29,780
He hates getting games with her and Because like and the hacker because like he's lost games against the hacker multiple times and he hates that She just uses her to lose her every time With like have him like hack and stuff to get her high elo or some shit From what I'm told and so like every time he and every time he sees them He would call them out in game like no matter what He recognized that it was her and the hacker,

5306
06:33:30,340 --> 06:33:31,920
but they were on alt accounts.

5307
06:33:32,200 --> 06:33:33,020
So he called them out.

5308
06:33:33,440 --> 06:33:34,460
And then he called them.

5309
06:33:34,540 --> 06:33:39,520
He was like, oh, like, I don't care if you're...

5310
06:33:39,520 --> 06:33:40,340
Because he was playing Ultron.

5311
06:33:40,500 --> 06:33:42,620
And he was like, please put Snowflake on me to the Luna.

5312
06:33:43,020 --> 06:33:46,480
And she refused to put Snowflake on her because she wants to pocket the hacker.

5313
06:33:47,300 --> 06:33:48,240
So, um...

5314
06:33:49,820 --> 06:33:51,980
So he wanted to pocket the hacker.

5315
06:33:52,260 --> 06:33:54,720
But normally you would put the Snowflake on Ultron.

5316
06:33:55,280 --> 06:33:56,360
Oh, the Ultron can...

5317
06:33:56,360 --> 06:33:57,540
Okay, I'll tell the rest of the story later.

5318
06:33:57,840 --> 06:33:58,920
Fucking it's gaming time.

5319
06:34:00,560 --> 06:34:01,300
I'm sorry.

5320
06:34:01,620 --> 06:34:03,220
This is a cliffhanger right now.

5321
06:34:04,080 --> 06:34:06,320
We're at a cliffhanger right now, guys.

5322
06:34:08,640 --> 06:34:11,480
But I swear, the story will get really interesting.

5323
06:34:11,980 --> 06:34:15,560
For those who are not members, I swear to God, this is a very...

5324
06:34:17,860 --> 06:34:19,820
This is a very interesting story.

5325
06:34:25,400 --> 06:34:25,880
Okay.

5326
06:34:26,360 --> 06:34:28,260
I just need to focus on this right now.

5327
06:34:28,280 --> 06:34:35,580
now oh my god i thought he was gonna

5328
06:34:38,620 --> 06:34:44,340
please he's so low there we go there we go

5329
06:34:47,610 --> 06:34:49,470
oh my god i'm gonna be dead aren't i

5330
06:34:53,700 --> 06:34:54,640
right here

5331
06:35:00,170 --> 06:35:06,290
oh my god i'm hiding in here please can we cap the point Why am I still here?

5332
06:35:15,190 --> 06:35:15,530
Alright.

5333
06:35:19,650 --> 06:35:20,210
Oh Maya.

5334
06:35:22,810 --> 06:35:25,450
This is bad we sort of.

5335
06:35:28,790 --> 06:35:29,470
Okay.

5336
06:35:30,130 --> 06:35:31,950
I think this is safe.

5337
06:35:35,750 --> 06:35:37,210
I feel so safe in here.

5338
06:35:39,970 --> 06:35:41,150
Just needed the cat point.

5339
06:35:41,830 --> 06:35:42,410
That's it.

5340
06:35:47,200 --> 06:35:48,700
Jesus Christ, please!

5341
06:35:52,890 --> 06:35:54,530
Oh my god, we didn't cat point.

5342
06:35:55,890 --> 06:35:57,150
I swear to God.

5343
06:35:57,570 --> 06:35:59,090
Alright, I'm gonna go Ultron.

5344
06:35:59,770 --> 06:36:01,490
I'll go Ultron now.

5345
06:36:03,190 --> 06:36:04,550
I hate playing Ultron.

5346
06:36:04,890 --> 06:36:06,350
I'm not very good at him, too.

5347
06:36:09,850 --> 06:36:11,530
I'm not very good at Ultron.

5348
06:36:12,590 --> 06:36:14,410
But like, it's...

5349
06:36:14,410 --> 06:36:16,070
I know nobody's doing...

5350
06:36:16,090 --> 06:36:18,030
anything with damage boost.

5351
06:36:18,970 --> 06:36:20,410
Oh my god, I didn't realize he got frozen.

5352
06:36:20,570 --> 06:36:21,310
That's my bad.

5353
06:36:23,510 --> 06:36:25,030
That was...

5354
06:36:25,030 --> 06:36:27,250
By the eye of Agumoto.

5355
06:36:28,970 --> 06:36:29,890
There you go.

5356
06:36:35,880 --> 06:36:36,960
Oh my god.

5357
06:36:38,500 --> 06:36:41,480
We're all like super split up.

5358
06:36:41,640 --> 06:36:42,640
That's the only issue.

5359
06:36:43,400 --> 06:36:48,460
Because we don't have frontline, so it's a lot more...

5360
06:36:49,680 --> 06:36:53,120
It's a lot more fucking chaotic because of it.

5361
06:36:53,220 --> 06:36:55,360
We just don't have fucking front line.

5362
06:36:57,520 --> 06:36:58,940
Everybody is just...

5363
06:36:58,940 --> 06:37:01,240
Oh, so nobody is calming where to go?

5364
06:37:04,300 --> 06:37:05,000
Alright, it's fine.

5365
06:37:07,660 --> 06:37:08,260
Alright.

5366
06:37:14,110 --> 06:37:15,770
Alright, here we go.

5367
06:37:18,450 --> 06:37:18,910
Here we go.

5368
06:37:26,550 --> 06:37:28,490
Oh my, that doesn't matter.

5369
06:37:29,050 --> 06:37:30,290
I can't do anything.

5370
06:37:30,610 --> 06:37:32,530
There's like, uh...

5371
06:37:33,790 --> 06:37:34,950
I got deleted.

5372
06:37:35,050 --> 06:37:37,930
No, it's... It sucks because, like, there's literally no front line.

5373
06:37:39,150 --> 06:37:40,970
Like, they all have... There's all...

5374
06:37:40,970 --> 06:37:42,930
Everything is, like, front line.

5375
06:37:44,010 --> 06:37:45,870
Everything is just so chaotic.

5376
06:37:53,940 --> 06:37:55,460
There's just no front line.

5377
06:37:56,940 --> 06:37:57,440
Oh, well.

5378
06:37:57,880 --> 06:37:58,900
There's nothing we can do.

5379
06:37:59,980 --> 06:38:01,740
The current score is...

5380
06:38:01,740 --> 06:38:02,180
Zero.

5381
06:38:04,240 --> 06:38:05,640
Okay, the story.

5382
06:38:05,960 --> 06:38:21,580
Okay, basically, um, so, um, what happened was that, um, the Luna, uh, who was the name, she didn't snowflake our Ultron, which is my duo.

5383
06:38:22,260 --> 06:38:28,640
And then my Ultra, my duo got really mad because, um, because, like, that's meta.

5384
06:38:28,760 --> 06:38:31,840
That's how you're supposed to play, like, Ultron and Luna.

5385
06:38:32,220 --> 06:38:34,780
You snowflake the Ultron so he can live.

5386
06:38:35,280 --> 06:38:37,180
And then he'll just drone the DPS.

5387
06:38:38,120 --> 06:38:40,320
And I don't think we're winning this.

5388
06:38:41,480 --> 06:38:44,060
I really don't think I'll do this.

5389
06:38:44,740 --> 06:38:54,240
So basically what happened is that, bro, I had a drone on you.

5390
06:38:56,100 --> 06:38:58,420
Basically, and also Mantis, I should be frontline.

5391
06:38:58,580 --> 06:38:59,600
I'm not behind you.

5392
06:38:59,940 --> 06:39:01,560
It should have been the Jeff that heals you.

5393
06:39:02,220 --> 06:39:02,960
shouldn't be me.

5394
06:39:03,640 --> 06:39:05,480
Jeff should be the one that heals you, bro.

5395
06:39:05,980 --> 06:39:09,740
Like, so if anyone is not healing you, it's Jeff.

5396
06:39:09,900 --> 06:39:12,540
I was playing Mantis and Ultron and I droned you.

5397
06:39:12,860 --> 06:39:18,960
Like, so, no, it's not my, it can't be my, okay, it might be minus 25, I don't know.

5398
06:39:19,380 --> 06:39:22,120
But like, it shouldn't, it could be like minus 20, most likely.

5399
06:39:22,460 --> 06:39:25,640
Five, four, three, two, one.

5400
06:39:27,220 --> 06:39:33,700
But also, like, ever since that guy got caught, got caught hacking, he his main account disappeared.

5401
06:39:33,800 --> 06:39:34,800
Like, he never played any...

5402
06:39:34,800 --> 06:39:35,300
He never played...

5403
06:39:35,300 --> 06:39:37,280
He just creates accounts, basically.

5404
06:39:38,580 --> 06:39:40,620
He plays accounts to...

5405
06:39:40,620 --> 06:39:41,480
Like, I don't know.

5406
06:39:41,580 --> 06:39:42,420
I'm healing you.

5407
06:39:42,700 --> 06:39:45,640
I'm standing on the back line just so I can heal you.

5408
06:39:46,200 --> 06:39:47,060
Like, I don't know.

5409
06:39:49,420 --> 06:39:49,940
Also...

5410
06:39:50,660 --> 06:39:51,180
Like...

5411
06:39:51,180 --> 06:39:52,940
Literally doing my job.

5412
06:39:53,140 --> 06:39:54,260
Doing everything I can.

5413
06:39:54,380 --> 06:39:55,640
I'm standing behind you.

5414
06:39:56,180 --> 06:39:58,260
I'm standing behind you still.

5415
06:39:59,400 --> 06:40:00,760
So, I hope...

5416
06:40:03,060 --> 06:40:04,720
All right, so you're getting healed.

5417
06:40:04,960 --> 06:40:06,200
You can't complain about lack of heals.

5418
06:40:06,340 --> 06:40:08,080
I'm literally right behind you.

5419
06:40:08,100 --> 06:40:08,420
Whoa.

5420
06:40:09,140 --> 06:40:10,820
Oh, you can't say it hurts.

5421
06:40:11,100 --> 06:40:12,000
Girl, you can't.

5422
06:40:12,000 --> 06:40:12,740
I'm okay.

5423
06:40:13,380 --> 06:40:13,380
Oh.

5424
06:40:17,660 --> 06:40:18,380
All right.

5425
06:40:22,160 --> 06:40:22,640
Okay.

5426
06:40:22,720 --> 06:40:24,380
Oh, I'm not gonna make it easy.

5427
06:40:25,780 --> 06:40:26,100
All right.

5428
06:40:27,400 --> 06:40:32,200
Yeah, because he would, he used to be like top, top 50 or some shit on.

5429
06:40:32,220 --> 06:40:48,500
he was like a top 50 silo player and there was like a huge debate on whether or not this guy was hacking from all the pros from what i'm told and then um and then like oh i think i should have oh

5430
06:40:52,140 --> 06:42:09,820
i'm sorry bro there was nothing i could do there was actually nothing i could do but there was nothing i could do bro i like what do you want me i could i could walk a little i have to go for my own life all right so what happened was that um the lunar refused and then um my duo got mad and like stood in front of the lunar was like please heal me please put the snowflake on me i know you want to and then he got really tilted and then like was like type big was like hey i if we want to win a game i need you to snowflake me so i can get healed and because she just wanted to pocket the hacker and then um and then the luna was like uh he know like i don't remember what she said but like she was just like um ignoring him and then my duo exploded on her and was like uh look i know you want a snowflake your um um your uh i know you want to snow snowflake your um e-boyfriend but like if you want a game um please i just need a snowflake and i can pocket your boyfriend and then you can get

5431
06:42:09,820 --> 06:42:29,460
boosted um all you want like and then she was like uh to him um oh yeah yeah yeah if yeah i yeah if i'm the boosted, you're a booster, so who's worse, implying that he's boosting me?

5432
06:42:30,300 --> 06:42:33,220
And I'm like, what did I do?

5433
06:42:36,200 --> 06:42:41,500
Also, getting boosted is a lot worse than being boosted, than boosting.

5434
06:42:47,040 --> 06:42:52,800
Like, I feel like getting boosted is a lot worse than being a booster.

5435
06:42:55,120 --> 06:43:01,520
Because at least the booster, like the, like, because at least the booster is good at the game.

5436
06:43:02,060 --> 06:43:09,240
Like, like, I was like, I was like, I was like, yeah, what are you saying fuck me for?

5437
06:43:09,920 --> 06:43:12,700
And so, and then, do you think you want to be today?

5438
06:43:13,740 --> 06:43:16,680
And then she was like, yeah, did you not see your duo?

5439
06:43:16,840 --> 06:43:20,380
She altered nothing when the round was already over.

5440
06:43:20,680 --> 06:43:22,480
But I altered the point.

5441
06:43:22,480 --> 06:44:48,020
and then the mag c9 because I ulted so we won the point because of it so I was like bro what I won us the round with my ult because the mag tried was chasing after me when I ulted so then he c9 and then we won the round like so I was like why are you saying fuck me for and then and then my duo was like um oh i hope you enjoy your discord sleep call um um tonight after this game um and then she was like i hope you do too and i'm like bro but i said nothing during this entire conversation i didn't do anything i said nothing i was playing the game and I was reading and then and then so then like I don't know she hates me because I played with a person someone like I play with so many people I play with so many different people like I can't control what my duo says like I can't control it like I wasn't even paying attention so what was my god like i'm playing the game

5442
06:44:53,120 --> 06:45:33,040
and then yeah and then she like attacked me as a way to attack him i was like bro if you're like attack attack him for it like just use something else like why are you attacking me for what he said like me three seconds before you attack oh yeah but she also played with like um like a fucking a racist too that would say slurs and stuff in vc so i'm like oh before she played with a hacker and that guy also disappeared too because like everyone like um exposed him as like a really like a weirdo and then he also disappeared from rank

5443
06:45:37,960 --> 06:45:45,060
oh my god wait she was on stream remember that time when there was like this weird ass go.

5444
06:45:45,440 --> 06:45:47,560
And it was like on the Loki map.

5445
06:45:47,960 --> 06:45:51,820
And then like her and the other guy were just flaming each other and they were duoed.

5446
06:45:52,120 --> 06:45:52,920
Like that was them.

5447
06:45:53,160 --> 06:45:55,400
That wasn't the... That wasn't like the book.

5448
06:45:55,460 --> 06:45:56,220
She wasn't playing with the hacker.

5449
06:45:56,360 --> 06:45:57,440
She was just playing with the weirdo.

5450
06:45:57,520 --> 06:45:57,940
The creep.

5451
06:45:58,580 --> 06:45:59,440
The actual creep.

5452
06:46:03,100 --> 06:46:06,860
If anyone remembered that game and we were like, what the fuck is going on?

5453
06:46:07,340 --> 06:46:12,900
But yeah, that was when she used to play with the creep guy.

5454
06:46:12,900 --> 06:46:40,880
The like actual like gamer words guy And then he was just like talking shit about her And he was just like talking shit about like Like his duo or her duo Was just shit talking her Talking how she's such a bad player and stuff And I was just like what the Okay I need us focus now I'm not focusing I'm sorry Okay that's my bad I'm sorry

Oh, that sucks.

5493
06:54:30,300 --> 06:54:31,840
Um, we couldn't stack in time.

5494
06:54:32,520 --> 06:54:34,220
Oh, that's unfortunate.

5495
06:54:36,940 --> 06:54:38,140
That's unfortunate.

5496
06:54:39,320 --> 06:54:41,420
We were not stacked up for it.

5497
06:54:47,310 --> 06:54:48,750
Alright, here we go.

5498
06:54:52,570 --> 06:54:53,150
Okay.

5499
06:54:53,670 --> 06:54:55,950
Please, they are playing, uh...

5500
06:54:57,070 --> 06:54:58,470
They're playing Luna.

5501
06:54:59,250 --> 06:55:00,130
So, like...

5502
06:55:00,130 --> 06:55:03,710
I'm tempted to play Luna just for the combo, actually.

5503
06:55:03,950 --> 06:55:35,190
I should play Luna just to grab the combo but I feel like I don't know actually I don't know it would be better because then we can have patty cake too okay oh my Who did he even hit?

5504
06:55:35,510 --> 06:55:39,630
Oh my

5505
06:55:45,600 --> 06:55:45,940
god.

5506
06:55:46,220 --> 06:55:47,440
Oh, I just got all...

5507
06:55:48,300 --> 06:55:50,620
I was like, who did he even hit?

5508
06:55:53,720 --> 06:55:54,280
Jesus.

5509
06:55:55,820 --> 06:55:57,740
It's clear I'm still needed here.

5510
06:55:59,580 --> 06:56:01,320
Okay, this is fine.

5511
06:56:01,500 --> 06:56:02,120
This is not fine.

5512
06:56:02,500 --> 06:56:03,860
I'm gonna swap off after all.

5513
06:56:05,520 --> 06:56:07,360
Because like, I honestly think...

5514
06:56:07,880 --> 06:56:09,460
Just for the combo, maybe?

5515
06:56:10,300 --> 06:56:11,180
I'm debating.

5516
06:56:12,740 --> 06:56:13,500
I don't know.

5517
06:56:17,480 --> 06:56:19,460
I don't want to play it.

5518
06:56:22,160 --> 06:56:22,600
What?

5519
06:56:23,220 --> 06:56:23,920
Oh my god.

5520
06:56:24,400 --> 06:56:24,760
It didn't.

5521
06:56:25,280 --> 06:56:26,300
We all stepped.

5522
06:56:30,480 --> 06:56:31,100
Oh, what?

5523
06:56:31,160 --> 06:56:32,000
I thought we were committing.

5524
06:56:33,260 --> 06:56:33,700
Oh, I'm dead.

5525
06:56:33,780 --> 06:56:34,060
I'm dead.

5526
06:56:34,540 --> 06:56:35,000
Oh, nice.

5527
06:56:36,880 --> 06:56:37,320
Nice.

5528
06:56:41,170 --> 06:56:42,250
Oh my god.

5529
06:56:42,750 --> 06:56:43,190

5530
06:56:43,270 --> 06:56:43,610
I got you.

5531
06:56:44,370 --> 06:56:58,630
I had to use that to win the round I think it's just we have rocket oh he used that to relocate

5532
06:57:01,640 --> 06:57:19,510

I missed the platform.

5535
06:57:29,610 --> 06:57:30,770
This is not good for me.

5536
06:57:32,450 --> 06:57:34,230
This is not good for me.

5537
06:57:34,890 --> 06:57:35,650
He has...

5538
06:57:35,650 --> 06:57:37,870
The only issue is that they do have siloed up.

5539
06:57:39,710 --> 06:57:41,910
I don't know if we can stack this.

5540
06:57:47,950 --> 06:57:50,090
Oh my god, that's just scaring me.

5541
06:57:54,650 --> 06:57:56,350
I am ready to put on a show.

5542
06:58:05,550 --> 06:58:17,990

5552
06:59:45,050 --> 06:59:47,110
Fear Magneto!

5553
06:59:48,430 --> 06:59:54,070
I could have kept my ult.

5554
06:59:54,130 --> 06:59:55,130
I'm so mad.

5555
06:59:55,930 --> 06:59:59,430
Like, we lost my ult because of that.

5556
07:00:01,070 --> 07:00:01,510
Oh, I got hit.

5557
07:00:01,550 --> 07:00:01,850

5558
07:00:03,090 --> 07:00:03,770
I got hit.

5559
07:00:08,330 --> 07:00:09,470
That's unlucky.

5560
07:00:11,990 --> 07:00:16,190
I'm just sad because we lost our Invis alt for no reason.

5561
07:00:23,540 --> 07:00:24,760
Just came back.

5562
07:00:25,300 --> 07:00:26,400
Oh, this is not winnable.

5563
07:00:33,330 --> 07:00:34,810
I could have had my Invis alt.

5564
07:00:35,670 --> 07:00:36,490
I literally...

5565
07:00:36,490 --> 07:00:37,350
Oh my god.

5566
07:00:37,910 --> 07:00:41,450
If I knew they were planning on swapping it, I would have kept my...

5567
07:00:41,450 --> 07:00:43,190
I could have had Invis alt for that fight.

5568
07:00:45,650 --> 07:00:46,650
It didn't make sense.

5569
07:00:51,290 --> 07:00:52,430
Where are they?

5570
07:00:53,270 --> 07:00:53,950

Wait.

07:01:09,610 --> 07:01:11,890
I have to use that.

5574
07:01:15,490 --> 07:01:17,690
This fucking sucks!

5575
07:01:21,550 --> 07:01:24,490
I'm sorry, but...

5576
07:01:24,490 --> 07:01:26,290
Oh my god, there's nothing I could do.

5577
07:01:27,870 --> 07:01:28,530
I'm...

5578
07:01:28,550 --> 07:01:41,370
Oh my god This is such a hard game I am strengthened I don't give up so easily Win, please I think

5579
07:01:45,330 --> 07:01:57,730
it's unlucky because we're forcing Thor I think that's really it We're just forcing Thor into this And we are not We can't run triple

5580
07:02:01,310 --> 07:02:07,210
Win, please Bro, that's all he wants.

5581
07:02:07,770 --> 07:02:08,950
Please, he just wants to win.

5582
07:02:10,230 --> 07:02:14,070
I feel like I'm going to let him build also a little bit, though.

5583
07:02:25,270 --> 07:02:26,470
Jesus Christ.

5584
07:02:27,230 --> 07:02:28,430
This game is too hard.

5585
07:02:29,970 --> 07:02:31,730
Guys, I missed my...

5586
07:02:31,730 --> 07:02:33,430

5587
07:02:33,930 --> 07:02:34,490

5592
07:02:55,030 --> 07:02:55,510
Oh my god.

5593
07:02:55,810 --> 07:02:56,310
I don't have all.

5594
07:02:56,590 --> 07:02:57,910
That's the worst part.

5595
07:03:03,710 --> 07:03:04,210
Okay.

5596
07:03:08,290 --> 07:03:09,030
Oh my god.

5597
07:03:14,610 --> 07:03:15,530
Oh my god.

5598
07:03:15,570 --> 07:03:16,990
Oh my god, there you go.

5599
07:03:18,990 --> 07:03:20,570
Oh my god.

5600
07:03:21,450 --> 07:03:23,870
Oh, thank you.

5601
07:03:23,890 --> 07:03:24,270

Thank God.

5603
07:03:28,030 --> 07:03:28,510
Thank God.

5604
07:03:30,230 --> 07:03:31,590
I'm so scared!

5605
07:03:35,630 --> 07:03:37,290
I'm so scared!

5606
07:03:39,230 --> 07:03:41,070
Please, Jesus, I pulled her back.

5607
07:03:41,550 --> 07:03:42,190
Please kill her.

5608
07:03:42,550 --> 07:03:43,910
Please kill her.

5609
07:03:55,570 --> 07:03:56,850
Wait, did we...

5610
07:03:56,850 --> 07:03:57,570
We broke it.

5611
07:03:57,670 --> 07:03:57,790
Okay.

5612
07:03:59,910 --> 07:04:00,550
No!

5613
07:04:01,410 --> 07:04:02,270
Oh, C9!

5614
07:04:02,990 --> 07:04:03,450
Yay!

5615
07:04:03,450 --> 07:04:03,810
Yay!

5616
07:04:05,290 --> 07:04:07,650
Yay, I made a C9!

5617
07:04:12,030 --> 07:04:15,590
Oh my god, his wish came true!

5618
07:04:17,270 --> 07:04:18,670
Please win!

5619
07:04:19,250 --> 07:04:21,150
His wish came true!

5620
07:04:21,850 --> 07:04:23,150

5621
07:04:24,050 --> 07:04:29,570

5622
07:04:30,110 --> 07:04:31,390
Please win!

5623
07:04:31,390 --> 07:04:33,890
The desperate plea works.

5624
07:04:34,410 --> 07:04:35,150
His plea.

5625
07:04:35,650 --> 07:04:37,470
But he was like.

5626
07:04:37,990 --> 07:04:39,070
He created.

5627
07:04:39,610 --> 07:04:42,310
He chanted a spell on this game.

5628
07:04:43,090 --> 07:04:46,130
When we knew saying win please would work.

5629
07:04:46,910 --> 07:04:47,810
Win the please.

5630
07:04:48,650 --> 07:04:49,490
Who said that?

5631
07:04:49,630 --> 07:04:50,690
I think it was.

5632
07:04:54,270 --> 07:04:55,190
It was.

5633
07:04:55,430 --> 07:04:56,510
Was it this guy?

5634
07:04:57,650 --> 07:04:58,410
Icarcto.

5635
07:04:58,850 --> 07:04:59,990
I don't know who this guy is.

5636
07:05:00,310 --> 07:05:01,250
The wish.

5637
07:05:01,390 --> 07:05:02,250
Groucher.

5638
07:05:02,410 --> 07:05:02,670
Groucher.

5639
07:05:02,850 --> 07:05:03,870
They give the 150s.

5640
07:05:03,870 --> 07:05:04,170
Thank you.

5641
07:05:04,210 --> 07:05:05,030
Thank you.

5642
07:05:06,110 --> 07:05:07,570
It was fair.

5643
07:05:07,830 --> 07:05:14,530
See, if the other players were just as polite as this guy, then games would be much easier to win.

5644
07:05:17,230 --> 07:05:18,470
Is it Gen G?

5645
07:05:18,830 --> 07:05:19,810
I mean, I can look it up.

5646
07:05:20,270 --> 07:05:20,770
Gen G.

5647
07:05:22,830 --> 07:05:25,050
Marvel Rivals Ignite.

5648
07:05:25,570 --> 07:05:26,970
Gen G Esport.

5649
07:05:28,430 --> 07:05:29,670
No, he's not in Gen G.

5650
07:05:30,070 --> 07:05:31,090
He Carkstow.

5651
07:05:33,390 --> 07:05:35,050
That guy's not an Gen-G.

5652
07:05:36,510 --> 07:05:36,910
Whoa.

5653
07:05:39,450 --> 07:05:40,370
Why are you mad?

5654
07:05:41,930 --> 07:05:42,950
Just be nice to you.

5655
07:05:43,170 --> 07:05:43,890
Just say please.

5656
07:05:44,870 --> 07:05:46,350
Oh, is he on the bench?

5657
07:05:47,410 --> 07:05:48,990
Oh, wait, he's a support player?

5658
07:05:55,290 --> 07:05:56,450
Yeah, I don't see him in the liquid.

5659
07:05:57,610 --> 07:05:58,850
It's not time yet.

5660
07:05:58,910 --> 07:05:59,570
It's too early.

5661
07:05:59,670 --> 07:06:01,850
I'll give him a little treat to satisfy him.

5662
07:06:01,950 --> 07:06:02,530
I'll be right back.

5663
07:06:49,170 --> 07:06:50,090
You guys little treat.

5664
07:06:50,110 --> 07:06:50,370
Treat.

5665
07:06:50,710 --> 07:06:52,230
Now he's a happy boy.

5666
07:06:55,910 --> 07:06:58,170
That is top 500 in our hearts.

5667
07:06:58,710 --> 07:06:59,510
Yeah, you guys little treat.

5668
07:06:59,710 --> 07:07:02,270
So now he's not a troublemaker anymore.

5669
07:07:04,750 --> 07:07:05,610
This is...

5670
07:07:05,610 --> 07:07:11,390
This is... This type of record is true... This record is true pain.

5671
07:07:13,210 --> 07:07:14,770
This is actually...

5672
07:07:14,770 --> 07:07:16,030
I hate making a zebra.

5673
07:07:19,990 --> 07:07:23,870
this is actual pain the zebra

5674
07:07:34,510 --> 07:07:36,170
we're going 50 50.

5675
07:07:37,030 --> 07:07:52,350
yeah and the winds of course of course they're less than though of course they are because i can have nice things i can never have and i'm going i bet you i'm going to get like 17 or 18 not 19 though because we're not here to make me happy Wait,

5676
07:07:55,390 --> 07:08:02,450
I bet you I'm not even, I'm gonna get like plus, if I win the next one, it'll be plus 17 or plus 18.

5677
07:08:02,710 --> 07:08:04,850
Or even 16 if they feel a little quirky.

5678
07:08:05,730 --> 07:08:07,250
But it won't be 19, though.

5679
07:08:07,490 --> 07:08:08,850
It's never 19.

5680
07:08:10,370 --> 07:08:11,870
See, plus 18.

5681
07:08:12,970 --> 07:08:16,610
19 is just a little too generous.

5682
07:08:29,340 --> 07:08:30,300
Oh, yeah.

5683
07:08:30,520 --> 07:08:32,380
Also, like the, that girl.

5684
07:08:32,900 --> 07:08:35,240
She used to be super nice in game, too.

5685
07:08:35,320 --> 07:08:37,220
I don't fucking know what happened to her.

5686
07:08:37,660 --> 07:08:39,760
Because I remember bumping into her in season zero.

5687
07:08:40,340 --> 07:08:42,820
And she used to be, like, so nice.

5688
07:08:43,060 --> 07:08:44,960
And then, like, she started being...

5689
07:08:44,960 --> 07:08:45,760
And then later...

5690
07:08:45,760 --> 07:08:47,300
I don't know what happened to her.

5691
07:08:47,600 --> 07:08:48,720
Because I remember season zero.

5692
07:08:48,820 --> 07:08:50,180
She was, like, really nice.

5693
07:08:56,220 --> 07:08:57,740
Com actually changed her.

5694
07:08:57,860 --> 07:08:58,660
No, it did.

5695
07:08:58,960 --> 07:09:00,660
It made her a bitter person.

5696
07:09:01,940 --> 07:09:03,540
Maybe it was a facade.

5697
07:09:03,780 --> 07:09:06,320
Yeah, because I remember having her in, like, my game.

5698
07:09:06,320 --> 07:09:07,840
And then she'll be like, hi, Doki.

5699
07:09:08,460 --> 07:09:10,360
And she'll calm and stuff and everything.

5700
07:09:10,880 --> 07:09:12,720
And like, now she's so mean.

5701
07:09:13,020 --> 07:09:17,560
I was like, like, I would say she's mean because she was so mean to me randomly.

5702
07:09:17,820 --> 07:09:19,400
When I didn't say anything.

5703
07:09:24,270 --> 07:09:26,390
That's why I was like even more pissed off.

5704
07:09:36,050 --> 07:09:37,870
Frank actually changed the verse.

5705
07:09:38,010 --> 07:09:38,670
Changed her.

5706
07:10:02,400 --> 07:10:03,400
All right.

5707
07:10:08,860 --> 07:10:10,920
I'll do Luna for today.

5708
07:10:12,700 --> 07:10:16,160
I'll do Luna for one game right now.

5709
07:10:17,080 --> 07:10:19,720
Me when I lose two games in a row.

5710
07:10:20,460 --> 07:10:21,940
It's my Joker moment.

5711
07:10:37,580 --> 07:10:40,140
Yeah, then she started playing with Packers and stuff.

5712
07:10:40,260 --> 07:10:44,860
And I was like, bro, I don't think it's that important.

5713
07:10:54,240 --> 07:10:56,960
No fan iron fist, GG

5714
07:11:00,840 --> 07:11:04,440
Oh, that's by the way yellow colluge is choppa

5715
07:11:07,480 --> 07:11:12,760
That's choppa by the way For those who You remember choppa guys

5716
07:11:17,900 --> 07:11:22,560
That's him They say that music brings the world together.

5717
07:11:23,120 --> 07:11:23,880
The ghost.

5718
07:11:27,440 --> 07:11:29,820
Okay, I need to stand in front of my Jeff.

5719
07:11:37,470 --> 07:11:39,510
I hope my Jeff is okay.

5720
07:11:42,370 --> 07:11:43,130
I'm gonna stand.

5721
07:11:43,850 --> 07:11:45,170
Maybe I'll hit something, you know?

5722
07:11:48,570 --> 07:11:48,970
Wee!

5723
07:11:49,690 --> 07:11:50,550
I'm healing!

5724
07:11:50,730 --> 07:11:51,250
I'm healing!

5725
07:11:51,470 --> 07:11:51,950
I'm healing!

5726
07:11:52,750 --> 07:11:53,310
Yippee.

5727
07:11:53,890 --> 07:11:55,910
I'm doing it, Mr. Krabs.

5728
07:11:56,810 --> 07:11:58,790
Whoa, I'm doing it.

5729
07:11:59,390 --> 07:12:00,290
You think he's okay?

5730
07:12:00,430 --> 07:12:01,150
Is you think...

5731
07:12:01,150 --> 07:12:01,750
Oh, shit.

5732
07:12:02,030 --> 07:12:02,650
Oh, shit.

5733
07:12:02,790 --> 07:12:03,590
I don't have heels now.

5734
07:12:03,710 --> 07:12:04,390
I'm scared now.

5735
07:12:05,070 --> 07:12:10,290
You know when you don't have any more heels and you're just like...

5736
07:12:10,290 --> 07:12:11,630
Oh, my God!

5737
07:12:11,950 --> 07:12:14,170
He had how many people in his...

5738
07:12:15,070 --> 07:12:22,430
He just had the entire mafia in his mouth and just threw it into our faces.

5739
07:12:22,550 --> 07:12:25,870
I was like, bro, chill.

5740
07:12:26,870 --> 07:12:28,290
The thing is, I'm not building ult, though.

5741
07:12:28,450 --> 07:12:29,270
That's the scary part.

5742
07:12:29,830 --> 07:12:30,630
I should have waited for them.

5743
07:12:31,770 --> 07:12:34,370
Because the Jeff is building all the ult charge.

5744
07:12:39,390 --> 07:12:39,830
So...

5745
07:12:39,830 --> 07:12:42,710
Oh my, I'm just going to use this just in case.

5746
07:12:45,650 --> 07:12:47,630
Oh, I used my clap in the wrong moment.

5747
07:12:48,350 --> 07:12:49,570
I should have kept my clap there.

5748
07:12:52,550 --> 07:12:53,010
Okay, is Jeff?

5749
07:12:54,550 --> 07:12:54,550
Yes.

5750
07:12:57,560 --> 07:12:59,600
Oh my god, I'm so close to that though.

5751
07:13:03,640 --> 07:13:04,760
Oh no.

5752
07:13:06,220 --> 07:13:07,620
I don't want to use it yet.

5753
07:13:10,180 --> 07:13:12,060
Oh my god, please tell me I'm Bubba.

5754
07:13:12,480 --> 07:13:14,960
Please, yay, yay.

5755
07:13:15,780 --> 07:13:17,380
Oh, it doesn't matter.

5756
07:13:17,800 --> 07:13:18,660
It doesn't.

5757
07:13:18,900 --> 07:13:24,280
Oh my god, it doesn't matter because we don't have...

5758
07:13:24,300 --> 07:13:26,720
We don't have a fucking...

5759
07:13:26,720 --> 07:13:28,500
We don't have fucking...

5760
07:13:28,500 --> 07:13:30,200
Why did we not have a strange?

5761
07:13:31,420 --> 07:13:32,520
Okay, it's okay.

5762
07:13:33,160 --> 07:13:34,460
We don't need strange.

5763
07:13:34,620 --> 07:13:36,220
I don't think we're touching, guys.

5764
07:13:36,700 --> 07:13:37,220
I...

5765
07:13:37,220 --> 07:13:39,420
I don't think we're touching.

5766
07:13:40,460 --> 07:13:43,580
I'm surprised we didn't get a strange here.

5767
07:13:46,280 --> 07:13:47,640
That's all we need.

5768
07:13:49,740 --> 07:13:52,960
This is the only thing that sucks, because like I said, they have two defensive ups.

5769
07:13:57,000 --> 07:14:04,460
please live please live please live please live

What is it?

5774
07:14:57,440 --> 07:14:57,740
Yes.

5775
07:14:58,320 --> 07:14:59,660
That is his hero pull.

5776
07:15:02,980 --> 07:15:05,640
As long as he's having fun.

5777
07:15:06,400 --> 07:15:09,560
But I don't think he's having fun playing that.

5778
07:15:11,100 --> 07:15:12,140
Wait, this guy's what?

5779
07:15:13,280 --> 07:15:14,560
Oh my god, he's so low.

5780
07:15:14,820 --> 07:15:15,440
I'm so sad.

5781
07:15:18,520 --> 07:15:18,820
Okay.

5782
07:15:19,360 --> 07:15:19,640

5786
07:15:58,040 --> 07:16:00,560
If I had clap, I was literally one second away.

5787
07:16:02,020 --> 07:16:04,240
I was one second away from getting clap.

5788
07:16:05,100 --> 07:16:05,380
Clap, clap.

5789
07:16:10,590 --> 07:16:11,950
Oh my god, there he goes again.

07:16:13,470 --> 07:16:14,570
There he goes.

07:16:14,890 --> 07:16:16,090
Oh, and he's dead.

5792
07:16:16,470 --> 07:16:17,290
There he was.

5793
07:16:18,730 --> 07:16:19,970
Oh my god, they bubbled him.

5794
07:16:20,330 --> 07:16:21,250
Oh my god, they bubbled him.

5795
07:16:21,290 --> 07:16:21,910
Now what do we do?

5796
07:16:22,550 --> 07:16:23,730
You brought a strange over.

5797
07:16:24,150 --> 07:16:26,810
I got two supports.

5798
07:16:29,150 --> 07:16:30,450
What did we do?

5799
07:16:30,830 --> 07:16:33,270
He brought the fucking two- that's scary.

5800
07:16:39,750 --> 07:16:42,230
What the fuck?

5801
07:16:45,390 --> 07:16:46,930
That was so scary.

5802
07:16:47,330 --> 07:16:52,710
When he brought in the fucking mag over, the stranger, I was like, what do we do?

5803
07:16:55,530 --> 07:16:57,030
Oh my god, there he goes.

5804
07:16:57,830 --> 07:16:59,710
Kung Fu fighting yet again.

5805
07:17:01,150 --> 07:17:01,990
There he goes.

5806
07:17:03,370 --> 07:17:04,710
He's Kung Fu fighting guys.

5807
07:17:04,950 --> 07:17:05,830
There he goes again.

5808
07:17:06,650 --> 07:17:08,070
Almost have all two.

5809
07:17:11,370 --> 07:17:14,570
Oh, he could have lived.

5810
07:17:15,290 --> 07:17:16,930
He actually could have lived there.

5811
07:17:18,230 --> 07:17:19,050
I should know he can.

5812
07:17:19,150 --> 07:17:20,770
He was full charge or some shit.

5813
07:17:21,210 --> 07:17:21,810
Oh my god, I got stuck.

5814
07:17:22,150 --> 07:17:22,790
I got stuck.

5815
07:17:24,910 --> 07:17:26,110
I got stuck.

5816
07:17:26,270 --> 07:17:27,150
I'm so sad.

5817
07:17:28,810 --> 07:17:45,010
I couldn't I got body blocks so fucking hard Oh my god and they're running triple supreme fucking nerds A fucking curse It's time for animal crossing Boom, Kobe

5818
07:17:48,360 --> 07:17:50,040

5819
07:17:54,210 --> 07:18:16,130
It's animal crossing, Todd You got nobody It's animal crossing Here we go We're crossing and again and again and again and again

5820
07:18:19,530 --> 07:18:43,330
Yay I can feel it it would be everything but plus 19 and up It would be everything but that also I shouldn't oh my god I forgot we stopped the push oh now I jinxed it now I fucking jinxed it now

5821
07:18:49,530 --> 07:19:17,590
it's 6am I know I was supposed to end a lot earlier guys I'm sorry but like the the Elo agent must continue her job Round 2 Superpowers are amazing Also The ice effects look great on stage I have an assignment From upstairs From up above That I must continue to terrorize

5822
07:19:23,350 --> 07:19:34,810
I got word from up top I gotta continue to ruin lives An agents of Atlas reunion tour I don't know This is a true dude.

5823
07:19:37,990 --> 07:19:39,430
Keep on.

5824
07:19:39,570 --> 07:19:41,930
The soldier must continue.

5825
07:19:42,390 --> 07:19:43,690
The battle starts in five.

5826
07:19:44,210 --> 07:19:47,110
One of Guan Guan's best agents.

5827
07:19:47,310 --> 07:19:50,910
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

5828
07:19:51,510 --> 07:19:51,730
Oh yeah.

5829
07:19:52,230 --> 07:19:57,410
Apparently like, um, gains are also mostly dependent.

5830
07:19:57,890 --> 07:20:02,110
Like, because DPS players, they get like plus 25 and up sometimes.

5831
07:20:02,470 --> 07:20:03,210
Especially their MVP.

5832
07:20:03,230 --> 07:20:07,370
So it's like, it mostly depends on like, stuff like...

5833
07:20:10,510 --> 07:20:14,750
Stuff like how many final hits you get, how many damage you do.

5834
07:20:15,050 --> 07:20:17,810
So as a support, it's like, fuck me, you know?

5835
07:20:18,670 --> 07:20:23,090
As a support, we don't really get that privilege.

5836
07:20:23,910 --> 07:20:24,770
Fuck yeah, fuck yeah.

5837
07:20:27,010 --> 07:20:30,270
Hey, Bucky's in, oh, and he lives somehow.

5838
07:20:31,450 --> 07:20:32,510
I'm gonna get eaten, aren't I?

5839
07:20:33,330 --> 07:20:36,230
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

5840
07:20:40,850 --> 07:20:42,930
What the fuck is...

5841
07:20:48,380 --> 07:20:51,600
Oh my god, I have to use this just to be alive.

5842
07:20:55,340 --> 07:20:56,660
Okay, that's...

5843
07:20:56,660 --> 07:21:00,700
I like how it's just two Jeffs riding beside each other.

5844
07:21:01,180 --> 07:21:01,840
Like...

5845
07:21:06,320 --> 07:21:08,660
In the high, are you in Celestial, though?

5846
07:21:08,860 --> 07:21:16,820
In Celestial, if you're in, like, the lower Elo, that's, like, um, if it's, like, um, bro, this guy is getting fucked up.

5847
07:21:17,100 --> 07:21:22,080
If you're, like, in Diamond and Below, then, like, yeah, you get, like, plus 30 and stuff.

5848
07:21:22,380 --> 07:21:26,860
Yeah, but, like, if, like, Celestial and GM, it's, like, um.

5849
07:21:29,400 --> 07:21:36,000
Because, like, when I'm playing with some of my friends, they were, like, oh, I got, like, plus 18 on support.

5850
07:21:36,060 --> 07:21:51,500
I'm like welcome to my fucking life like I was like what do you mean wait is that not how much you're supposed to get like bro I got I can't believe it I got it

5851
07:21:54,720 --> 07:22:08,000

5852
07:22:12,560 --> 07:22:14,360
Thank you, Choppa.

5853
07:22:21,040 --> 07:22:22,860
Yummy, yummy.

5854
07:22:26,700 --> 07:22:27,460
Oh, I'm dead.

5855
07:22:28,660 --> 07:22:29,580
Oh my god, I'm dead.

5856
07:22:32,220 --> 07:22:34,100
It's okay, he hasn't got, he only got me.

5857
07:22:35,800 --> 07:22:38,240
Bro, this is a fight of a fucking sentry.

5858
07:22:41,000 --> 07:22:42,600
EOMM agent!

5859
07:22:43,180 --> 07:22:45,000
The transfer went through, guys!

5860
07:22:45,560 --> 07:22:47,160
We did it!

5861
07:22:50,120 --> 07:22:52,180
But Choppa's a pro player, guys.

5862
07:22:52,880 --> 07:22:54,940
I don't think he intended.

5863
07:22:55,700 --> 07:22:59,880
He just didn't think that this change was gonna do it.

5864
07:23:03,410 --> 07:23:04,790
He's done it.

5865
07:23:05,610 --> 07:23:06,910
Choppa, my goat.

5866
07:23:07,950 --> 07:23:10,110
For far, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

5867
07:23:10,230 --> 07:23:11,090
Thank you, thank you.

5868
07:23:13,630 --> 07:23:15,710
The transfer went through.

5869
07:23:16,390 --> 07:23:17,110
Yet again.

5870
07:23:17,490 --> 07:23:18,170
Watch this.

5871
07:23:34,090 --> 07:23:35,690
I told you.

5872
07:23:36,390 --> 07:23:38,330
I can't have any nice thing.

5873
07:23:39,110 --> 07:23:41,150
I literally need plus 19.

5874
07:23:41,850 --> 07:23:44,150
I improved the definition.

5875
07:23:44,810 --> 07:23:46,370
Getting edged right now.

5876
07:23:46,650 --> 07:23:47,330
Is this edging?

5877
07:23:47,610 --> 07:23:48,570
Is this it?

5878
07:23:48,990 --> 07:25:34,650
Like a true agent Guys, is this edging guys is Edging in my shooter game Born a goon forced edge I told you but yeah like if you're a support player you might get lower than DPS it's crazy when like my dps players they'll be like yeah i just got plus 26 and like plus 24 plus 22 and i'm like what like what do you mean no plus 21 look at that plus doesn't matter that i got 30 to most healing in the doesn't matter because like uh but plus 27 i've never seen those numbers before I um but because like support numbers are very heavily dependent on also like the damage numbers you do as a support um so you might get more if you do more damage as a support like the damage numbers and also final hits um that's why supports don't get a lot because like I didn't get a lot of i only got three final hits um and i did barely got a lot of damage because i spent most of my time um healing um um and supports is truly hate all right let's see i don't know how much is jeff got plus 17 see look at that

5879
07:25:34,650 --> 07:25:47,430
plus 17 it's because his heals he has two final hits i swear it's also reliant on final hits too I think it's heavily reliant on final hits and, like, damage number.

5880
07:25:47,730 --> 07:25:49,710
Look at, plus 17 for the support.

5881
07:25:50,210 --> 07:25:50,910
All right, let's see.

5882
07:25:52,450 --> 07:25:53,110
Oh, I can't.

5883
07:25:53,150 --> 07:25:54,510
I can't look at these guys.

5884
07:25:56,110 --> 07:25:56,310
Oh, wait.

5885
07:25:56,310 --> 07:25:57,890
It's because I'm on someone else's.

5886
07:26:00,490 --> 07:26:01,990
Healing number is barely given.

5887
07:26:02,170 --> 07:26:03,530
And also your KDA, too.

5888
07:26:04,670 --> 07:26:04,990
Yeah.

5889
07:26:05,770 --> 07:26:07,590
Your KDA as well.

5890
07:26:09,630 --> 07:26:11,130
Yeah, no, they still haven't fixed it.

5891
07:26:11,530 --> 07:27:33,490
So that's why, like, like dps gains more too and then obviously like if you if you're mvp you get more as well but like supports just barely get anything um it's like the mercy problem back then but like the opposite of the mercy problem where mercy was getting way too much sr uh back then in overwatch days i don't know if some of you guys remember this but back in overwatch there was a lot of like inflated tricks um that boosted in um in elo because overwatch um adjusted their um sr gains for mercy players um i don't know if it's like supports in general but the more res you do the more you gain and the less you lose so mercy players would just purposely let people die so they could res more um so they boost the stats of resing so they would purposely let you die and then so just so like they can get more sr um so people they would do that and um healing the more heals you do um the more uh yeah the more it's just literally it was based on your like res is basically um and then from

5892
07:27:33,490 --> 07:28:03,490
that a lot of like mercy players found out about that tactic and then mercy players from like gold flat um suddenly became like master and GM players um truly abused because people were loot and they were losing less so um I don't remember how much the gains were back then so like an example would be like you would lose 14 SR if you lose on mercy um but you will gain like 30 if you win

5893
07:28:07,620 --> 07:28:18,460
yeah so yeah and also they overvalued yeah they did that too they overvalued uh healing so boost at all, because they want to pad their heals.

5894
07:28:24,600 --> 07:28:29,580
And then, so that's why you would see, like, a lot of Mercy players, because I remember back then, you would, like, you're like, who is this player?

5895
07:28:29,660 --> 07:28:30,720
I've never seen this player before.

5896
07:28:31,140 --> 07:28:43,640
And then you look at their thing, and it's literally, they were, like, I remember back then, because I was in GM back then, and I would, look at it, and I'll be like, I've never seen this player before, and I look at their history, and there was, like,

5897
07:28:43,640 --> 07:28:46,660
last season, Plat Gold Mercy player.

5898
07:28:47,240 --> 07:28:55,440
And this season, GM Mercy And I was like so fucking confused because I was like what like where did you come from?

5899
07:28:55,960 --> 07:28:59,640
Yeah, and that was back then they fixed it in like two seasons.

5900
07:28:59,820 --> 07:29:01,660
I remember this was like a lot of time ago

5901
07:29:06,340 --> 07:29:11,220
Sure Do it

5902
07:29:14,760 --> 07:29:28,260
Doing it All right But this is what it's like this is the opposite of the mercy problem where supports don't gain a lot oh we've got god hey how did they know damn

5903
07:29:36,020 --> 07:29:47,220
we are destroyed oh we're a defense this is defense gg go next

5904
07:29:51,300 --> 07:29:53,560
Oh, what is that?

5905
07:29:53,820 --> 07:29:54,180
We're attack?

5906
07:29:55,440 --> 07:29:55,880
Is this?

5907
07:29:57,740 --> 07:29:58,540
Is this?

5908
07:30:00,480 --> 07:30:02,700
No, it's rockets targeted bad.

5909
07:30:02,860 --> 07:30:03,480
Oh, we're attack.

5910
07:30:03,680 --> 07:30:04,760
Okay, I thought we're defense.

5911
07:30:05,220 --> 07:30:07,200
When you have the fame part figured out.

5912
07:30:07,400 --> 07:30:07,760
Yeah, I was.

5913
07:30:10,780 --> 07:30:12,140
Put on an Angela.

5914
07:30:12,580 --> 07:30:16,160
Actually, I don't know who to put this on.

5915
07:30:16,440 --> 07:30:18,240
I feel I should put it on...

5916
07:30:18,240 --> 07:30:20,080
Oh, actually, I have a side lock.

5917
07:30:20,180 --> 07:30:21,040
What am I talking about?

5918
07:30:23,140 --> 07:30:23,560
Damn!

5919
07:30:25,940 --> 07:30:26,500
Damn!

5920
07:30:30,480 --> 07:30:30,640
Yeah!

5921
07:30:31,860 --> 07:30:33,820
But a little Overwatch history for you guys.

07:30:34,020 --> 07:30:35,600
The Overwatch lesson.

Four, three, two, one.

5924
07:30:42,900 --> 07:30:43,680
There we go.

5925
07:30:45,760 --> 07:30:47,000

That was a lot of damage.

I felt like that's...

5954
07:32:32,200 --> 07:32:33,100
Oh, it's because they're running.

5955
07:32:33,240 --> 07:32:36,660
Oh, have they yeah, they were running triple support.

5956
07:32:37,160 --> 07:32:39,320
I'm just wondering have they always been triple support?

5957
07:32:40,620 --> 07:32:47,240
Alright I'm gonna be with them for a little bit because I'm scared.

5958
07:32:49,980 --> 07:32:50,800

5961
07:32:54,660 --> 07:32:55,820

07:32:56,200 --> 07:32:57,200
They'll be okay, right?

5963
07:32:59,000 --> 07:33:00,340

5964
07:33:00,620 --> 07:33:02,480

07:34:48,850 --> 07:34:50,730

I don't know what else do you want me to do.

6008
07:36:23,420 --> 07:36:24,640

07:36:46,720 --> 07:36:49,740
Oh, we actually double support Ulster accidentally.

6019
07:36:50,360 --> 07:36:51,360
I'm so sad.

6020
07:36:52,640 --> 07:36:55,000

We were rushing.

6022
07:36:59,380 --> 07:37:00,980
We were rushing so high.

6023
07:37:05,040 --> 07:37:07,780

6057
07:42:20,470 --> 07:42:21,690

I'm doing my best.

6065
07:42:38,270 --> 07:42:39,990
I am doing my best.

6066
07:42:44,070 --> 07:42:45,250
Okay, do that.

6067
07:42:47,150 --> 07:42:47,470
Okay.

6068
07:42:47,790 --> 07:42:50,730
This is real firepower!

6069
07:42:51,430 --> 07:42:53,230
I am ready to be on a show!

6070
07:42:54,970 --> 07:42:55,790
Okay.

6071
07:43:00,710 --> 07:43:01,530
Alright.

6072
07:43:04,510 --> 07:43:05,110
That's okay.

6073
07:43:06,330 --> 07:43:07,990
It's not okay anymore.

6074
07:43:08,410 --> 07:43:09,690
It's not okay anymore.

6075
07:43:10,150 --> 07:43:12,170
It is absolutely not okay anymore.

6076
07:43:12,810 --> 07:43:13,530
Oh my god.

6077
07:43:16,270 --> 07:43:19,290
Hello, everybody.

6078
07:43:22,170 --> 07:43:22,930

6079
07:43:24,930 --> 07:43:26,950
He's keep doing it.

6080
07:43:27,610 --> 07:43:29,070
He's still againing.

6081
07:43:31,130 --> 07:43:32,070
Final score.

6082
07:43:32,550 --> 07:43:33,790
One, two, two.

6083
07:43:34,430 --> 07:43:36,830
I don't even know who's...

6084
07:43:36,830 --> 07:43:40,610
I guess because we didn't go triple support during attack.

6085
07:43:41,130 --> 07:43:43,150
Well, you can't expect to win them all.

6086
07:43:43,550 --> 07:43:45,190
He's a crazy raccoon.

6087
07:43:45,490 --> 07:43:46,630
This guy's pro, though.

6088
07:43:46,950 --> 07:43:48,890
He's duode with...

6089
07:43:48,890 --> 07:43:50,790

6090
07:43:51,550 --> 07:43:52,870

6091
07:43:53,670 --> 07:43:55,550
Guys, translate.

6092
07:43:56,310 --> 07:43:57,570
Who's he shit-talking?

6093
07:43:57,810 --> 07:43:58,170
Chat.

6094
07:44:00,890 --> 07:44:02,410
Minus 21.

6095
07:44:03,790 --> 07:44:04,270
Me?

6096
07:44:05,750 --> 07:44:07,710
What did I do?

6097
07:44:11,430 --> 07:44:13,090
Wait, what?

6098
07:44:15,700 --> 07:44:17,220
He was shit-talking me.

6099
07:44:17,240 --> 07:44:25,660
He told me to stay raccoon.

6100
07:44:32,740 --> 07:44:33,180
What?

6101
07:44:35,060 --> 07:44:36,280
Okay, no, you know what?

6102
07:44:36,400 --> 07:44:37,500
No, fuck that guy.

6103
07:44:43,840 --> 07:44:44,900
Fuck that guy.

6104
07:44:45,100 --> 07:44:46,820
I was glazing him because I was like...

6105
07:44:46,820 --> 07:44:47,980
Because he's dealing with chopper.

6106
07:44:49,400 --> 07:44:50,920
He was dealing with chopper.

6107
07:44:51,600 --> 07:44:52,460
And, um...

6108
07:44:52,480 --> 07:44:53,700
He's in Crazy Raccoon?

6109
07:44:53,820 --> 07:44:55,160
No, fuck that guy.

6110
07:45:00,400 --> 07:45:01,180
He's not.

6111
07:45:01,280 --> 07:45:03,340
You got one guy by first chatter.

6112
07:45:04,720 --> 07:45:06,520
Oh, he wasn't?

6113
07:45:06,600 --> 07:45:07,580
Wait, what was it?

6114
07:45:07,640 --> 07:45:08,480
What did he say?

6115
07:45:09,120 --> 07:45:12,200
All right, fuck that guy chatter that tried to shit talk.

6116
07:45:18,440 --> 07:45:19,960
It wasn't one guy.

6117
07:45:20,040 --> 07:45:21,560
There were several people saying that.

6118
07:45:21,820 --> 07:45:27,460
Because, like, I have Automod on, and he was like, He's like raccoon diff and stuff like that.

6119
07:45:29,500 --> 07:45:30,280
I,

6120
07:45:45,120 --> 07:45:47,380
when you, I was right-clicking.

6121
07:45:50,420 --> 07:45:52,380
Actually, fuck that guy.

6122
07:45:57,640 --> 07:45:58,440
Yeah, no.

6123
07:45:58,740 --> 07:45:59,580
He's a loser.

6124
07:46:02,160 --> 07:46:04,360
I wasn't getting one guy.

6125
07:46:05,360 --> 07:46:06,480
No, fuck him.

6126
07:46:07,760 --> 07:46:09,220
Actually, fuck him.

6127
07:46:09,520 --> 07:46:11,340
Negative chat abuse.

6128
07:46:12,020 --> 07:46:14,000
I just, you know what?

6129
07:46:14,940 --> 07:46:15,400
Fuck him.

6130
07:46:19,060 --> 07:46:19,960
See that guy?

6131
07:46:20,360 --> 07:46:21,180
Bad player.

6132
07:46:21,840 --> 07:46:23,260
Toxic mentality.

6133
07:46:31,420 --> 07:46:34,460
I hope I gate kept you from top 500.

6134
07:46:41,240 --> 07:46:44,660
You're seeing how I got up to this rank and how my...

6135
07:46:45,040 --> 07:46:47,680
My raccoon alt was so slow.

6136
07:46:49,240 --> 07:46:50,660
And I was like, what?

6137
07:46:51,280 --> 07:46:52,440
I'm sorry?

6138
07:46:52,780 --> 07:46:53,800
We were literally...

6139
07:46:53,800 --> 07:46:56,860
What did I do wrong?

6140
07:46:56,960 --> 07:46:59,260
I thought Invis was gonna alt first.

6141
07:47:01,040 --> 07:47:02,800
No one told me to alt first.

6142
07:47:09,290 --> 07:47:11,190
Yeah, but Chopper stream snipes.

6143
07:47:11,510 --> 07:47:12,470
He opens my stream.

6144
07:47:13,330 --> 07:47:14,070
That's the thing.

6145
07:47:16,310 --> 07:47:17,110
That's crazy.

6146
07:47:17,750 --> 07:47:18,930
That's actually crazy.

6147
07:47:19,570 --> 07:47:20,710
Choppa's dealed with him too.

6148
07:47:20,770 --> 07:47:22,290
That makes me pissed off.

6149
07:47:22,830 --> 07:47:24,790
Because Choppa knows me.

6150
07:47:25,550 --> 07:47:28,510
And he even sent me like a video message and everything.

6151
07:47:28,990 --> 07:47:29,870
Not a real home.

6152
07:47:29,890 --> 07:47:31,950
That's not a homie right there.

6153
07:47:32,030 --> 07:47:33,470
Not homie behavior.

6154
07:47:36,430 --> 07:47:38,350
Actual not homie behavior.

6155
07:47:43,500 --> 07:47:46,420
I was planning on seeing Choppa too.

6156
07:47:46,560 --> 07:47:47,540
During like.

6157
07:47:48,100 --> 07:47:49,780
When I was at the land.

6158
07:47:50,220 --> 07:47:51,500
Now I'm glad I didn't.

6159
07:47:53,300 --> 07:47:55,300
Because that actually pisses me off.

6160
07:47:56,040 --> 07:47:59,160
Like, if you don't defend your friend, if they're getting...

6161
07:47:59,160 --> 07:48:04,240
Like, I'm just saying, if you're friends with someone, and you're dealing with...

6162
07:48:04,240 --> 07:48:05,500
And you do it with someone.

6163
07:48:06,980 --> 07:48:09,320
And, um, you don't defend them.

6164
07:48:09,680 --> 07:48:10,720
And I'm saying...

6165
07:48:10,720 --> 07:48:11,920
You think I don't...

6166
07:48:11,920 --> 07:48:13,620
I have people who understand Korean.

6167
07:48:13,680 --> 07:48:14,960
Like, that's just not...

6168
07:48:14,960 --> 07:48:16,520
That's just facts.

6169
07:48:16,680 --> 07:48:17,360
Like, that's...

6170
07:48:17,360 --> 07:48:18,380
Like, um...

6171
07:48:19,800 --> 07:48:22,360
That's literally just, like, poor...

6172
07:48:22,380 --> 07:48:24,880
like bro behavior right there.

6173
07:48:29,050 --> 07:48:40,470
That's just, I feel like for me, because I have so much personal experience with people backstabbing each other and like being snakes and stuff, like I have no room for people like being snakes and things.

6174
07:48:41,190 --> 07:48:42,590
I have no room for that.

6175
07:48:44,450 --> 07:48:45,290
I don't know.

6176
07:48:45,370 --> 07:48:46,470
I just don't like that.

6177
07:48:46,690 --> 07:48:47,890
I really don't like that.

6178
07:48:48,130 --> 07:48:50,230
Because like, I...

6179
07:48:52,330 --> 07:48:52,850
Uh...

6180
07:48:54,230 --> 07:49:13,410
in 30 seconds stay strong yeah i don't know it's just put gives me like such an off-putting feeling about it i hate that i actually hate that shit so much it's very snake like and i don't i don't enjoy that

6181
07:49:18,580 --> 07:49:28,500
because like if if you talk i've i've defended my friends like i talk shit about like behind their Bro, and then I would message my friends about it.

6182
07:49:28,560 --> 07:49:30,440
I was like, bro, what the fuck is going on?

6183
07:49:30,920 --> 07:49:31,320
Like...

6184
07:49:32,200 --> 07:49:34,200
Because, like, I don't like that.

6185
07:49:34,660 --> 07:49:37,180
Like, I hate, like, non-genuine people.

6186
07:49:44,290 --> 07:49:45,370
But that's just me.

6187
07:49:45,430 --> 07:49:46,390
I just, I don't know.

6188
07:49:47,510 --> 07:49:48,970
Just not a big fan of that.

6189
07:49:49,870 --> 07:49:51,170
And it makes me a little sad.

6190
07:49:51,590 --> 07:49:54,010
Because I thought Chopper was a real one, you know?

6191
07:50:02,830 --> 07:50:05,150
Also, like, bro, this is what I'm saying.

6192
07:50:05,210 --> 07:50:06,890
Like, pro players and they're fucking weak.

6193
07:50:07,890 --> 07:50:43,940

07:50:48,600 --> 07:50:49,780
Wait, he got nobody.

6196
07:50:54,840 --> 07:50:56,760
Oh my god, but what about me though?

6197
07:50:56,860 --> 07:50:58,220
Okay, that was so smart.

6198
07:51:00,120 --> 07:51:00,800
Right there?

6199
07:51:01,160 --> 07:51:02,240
That was so smart.

6200
07:51:05,140 --> 07:51:05,980
Oh my god.

6201
07:51:06,760 --> 07:51:07,300
My wall.

6202
07:51:08,760 --> 07:51:09,380
My wall.

6203
07:51:10,320 --> 07:51:10,780
My wall.

6204
07:51:13,080 --> 07:52:15,440
my wall my wall I should have put it somewhere closer but I was so scared oh my god oh I couldn't get away I couldn't get away oh now he plays triple support what a bitch now he plays triple support so I it makes me really mad because it's like you know I think he knows who I am and he talks in a different language thinking that he gets to hide behind that's the thing he knows English but he had because a lot of these cream players actually know English and they hide behind they were he's hiding behind Korean Thinking that I won't be able to know what he's saying.

6205
07:52:18,460 --> 07:52:20,680
So that's what they...

6206
07:52:20,680 --> 07:52:21,700
That got me...

6207
07:52:21,700 --> 07:52:23,700
That fucking...

6208
07:52:23,700 --> 07:52:25,180
Rise my gears!

6209
07:52:27,640 --> 07:52:29,380
Yeah, to hide something, yeah.

6210
07:52:32,440 --> 07:52:41,710
Yeah, I hate it when people do that.

6211
07:52:41,990 --> 07:52:43,210
Oh my god, story time!

6212
07:52:43,210 --> 07:53:14,430
one time I had that happen to me when I was at school and like one lady was shit okay there was this parent and her kid and like she was shit talking like um she was like shit talking people during cafeteria in Cantonese and like not knowing that I could speak Cantonese and it was so off-putting and I was like in middle school or some shit and it was so off-putting and I literally turned around when I heard like a mom and her kid were just shit talking like random students They're back in Cantonese.

6213
07:53:14,730 --> 07:53:32,190
I literally turn around and was like, bro, like I know Cantonese like, um, don't stop that Like this is really fucking rude like and then she like they both shut up They both shut up after I said that That's why I'm saying like I don't like that.

6214
07:53:32,810 --> 07:53:45,310
So it like made me like extra peeved about it because I hate people who do that in general Okay, I'm gonna Gotta put this here.

6215
07:53:45,770 --> 07:53:47,210
I have to move it.

6216
07:53:51,520 --> 07:53:52,000
Yeah.

6217
07:53:58,400 --> 07:53:59,360
That's fine.

6218
07:53:59,520 --> 07:54:00,340
I have...

6219
07:54:01,040 --> 07:54:02,000
I will here.

6220
07:54:03,360 --> 07:54:05,660
I will here.

6221
07:54:06,200 --> 07:54:06,440
I will...

6222
07:54:06,980 --> 07:54:09,180
Yeah, and they always shut up when you talk back too.

6223
07:54:09,780 --> 07:54:13,540
That's why I say, that's why I like, personal experience, I've never liked that type of behavior.

6224
07:54:16,720 --> 07:54:43,660
I might be making enemies right now though but I just don't like rap behavior in general as I play raccoon I just don't like that behavior playing right as I play raccoon all right it's fine

6225
07:54:47,800 --> 07:54:48,320
Yeah.

6226
07:54:55,140 --> 07:54:56,700
Where is this?

6227
07:54:57,980 --> 07:54:58,280
What?

6228
07:55:04,460 --> 07:55:05,620
Where is it?

6229
07:55:05,880 --> 07:55:08,560
There's a fucking random Jeff here.

6230
07:55:10,300 --> 07:55:13,240
This is a random, are we not giving a fuck about this Jeff?

6231
07:55:13,240 --> 07:55:14,560
Power to us, I guess.

6232

07:55:20,500 --> 07:55:23,100

07:55:23,100 --> 07:55:23,520
Res?

Okay.

6236
07:55:29,780 --> 07:55:30,660
That's crazy.

6237
07:55:30,760 --> 07:55:33,060
I didn't even notice he was using it on the Res, to be fair.

6238
07:55:33,120 --> 07:55:34,120
I wasn't paying attention.

6239
07:55:40,920 --> 07:55:43,940
I wasn't paying attention at all, so I didn't realize...

6240
07:55:43,940 --> 07:55:44,740
That's my bad.

6241

07:58:19,210 --> 07:58:20,130
Oh my god.

6255
07:58:20,530 --> 07:58:21,090
Oh my god.

6256
07:58:21,250 --> 07:58:22,740
What the fuck is wrong with you?

6257
07:58:26,410 --> 07:58:27,350
Oh my god.

6258
07:58:27,490 --> 07:58:28,350
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

6259
07:58:28,810 --> 07:58:29,530
Please, please, please.

6260
07:58:30,650 --> 07:58:33,810
Oh, I got it off, though.

6261
07:58:33,950 --> 07:58:34,190
No!

6262
07:58:34,570 --> 07:58:35,250
I got it off!

6263
07:58:37,070 --> 07:58:39,350
I literally just got the old off.

6264
07:58:40,730 --> 07:58:41,730
Two, three.

6265
07:58:43,230 --> 07:58:44,530
Time to switch things up.

6266
07:58:44,870 --> 07:58:46,550
Including which side you're on.

6267
07:58:46,830 --> 07:58:48,210
I ult first, though.

6268
07:58:51,670 --> 07:58:54,110
I would ult first.

6269
07:58:54,910 --> 07:58:55,850
I don't know.

6270
07:58:56,130 --> 07:58:59,210
I would always ult first, and then I'll try to ult the second.

6271
07:59:06,630 --> 07:59:07,310
Was it not?

6272
07:59:08,290 --> 07:59:10,870
I'm pretty sure I ult it first every time.

6273
07:59:15,530 --> 07:59:16,850
Unless I'm mistaken.

6274
07:59:17,050 --> 07:59:17,970
Unless it's just ping.

6275
07:59:18,450 --> 07:59:19,830
Oh, it's West Coast, yeah.

6276
07:59:21,290 --> 07:59:25,510
I have no idea I swear to God I was all thing first

6277
07:59:35,530 --> 08:00:33,130
Nah but There's a lot of fake people though That's why I don't interact a lot with people Like being a content creator You realize there's just so many like There's so many like I guess like Fake people in the world That's why I don't do a lot of collabs anymore and um also why like i have a very very small group of people interact with what the fuck i think it was crazy he went triple support when they're fighting against us but he didn't go triple support um he didn't go triple support when it's like when it was just when I was on this team.

6278
08:00:34,250 --> 08:00:35,330
It is safer.

6279
08:00:36,370 --> 08:00:37,870
That's why I was super disappointed.

6280
08:00:38,190 --> 08:00:40,750
Because I thought, you know...

6281
08:00:42,070 --> 08:00:44,010
I thought Choppa was different.

6282
08:00:46,390 --> 08:00:48,330
I know it's just like one incident.

6283
08:00:48,950 --> 08:00:49,550
But still.

6284
08:00:49,870 --> 08:00:51,850
I think it's just a bitch move.

6285
08:00:57,770 --> 08:00:59,550
Holy shit, that's a...

6286
08:01:00,750 --> 08:01:06,970
god wait that's a wait what yeah i was gonna say that's a lot of people that that

6287
08:01:10,390 --> 08:01:20,270
oh here i am i don't think it was fine to up that only because like it's just us what

6288
08:01:23,390 --> 08:01:32,930
what the i mean it's just us three do it can i do i engage I mean, I can.

6289
08:01:39,470 --> 08:01:41,370
Oh my god.

6290
08:01:44,790 --> 08:01:47,050
Oh my god, okay.

6291
08:01:50,850 --> 08:01:52,930
I don't even know if I should engage.

6292
08:01:53,470 --> 08:01:56,050
Like, what the fuck am I...

6293
08:01:56,750 --> 08:01:58,930
What am I looking at?

6294
08:02:02,350 --> 08:02:11,510
Oh, by the way, I know which team I'm not, I know which team I'm not, um, I'm not cheering for it for Ignite.

6295
08:02:17,050 --> 08:02:18,910
All right, let's go.

6296
08:02:21,870 --> 08:02:24,370
This is real firepower.

6297
08:02:27,170 --> 08:02:29,270
Yeah, fuck that team.

6298
08:02:35,390 --> 08:02:38,890
If players like that, it ain't worth it.

6299
08:02:39,210 --> 08:02:44,010
Oh shit.

6300
08:02:51,850 --> 08:02:53,270
All right, I'll go something else.

6301
08:03:03,040 --> 08:03:04,840
Only 60 seconds left.

6302
08:03:05,600 --> 08:03:06,120
Oh,

6303
08:03:14,020 --> 08:03:18,620
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Doe fucking weird.

6304
08:03:24,440 --> 08:03:24,920
Oh.

6305
08:03:29,020 --> 08:03:30,060
Alright, here we go.

6306
08:03:31,380 --> 08:03:32,140
Hello, everyone.

6307
08:03:32,540 --> 08:03:33,920
Thank you so much for the raid.

6308
08:03:34,620 --> 08:03:37,840
For those who are new here, my name is Doe Keeper.

6309
08:03:38,000 --> 08:03:39,320
You know what's crazy?

6310
08:03:40,000 --> 08:03:43,480
Some of these people don't even know I stream, so they're, like, exposed.

6311
08:03:43,680 --> 08:03:48,980
These, like, uh, uh, players are exposing themselves.

6312
08:03:49,660 --> 08:03:51,800
in like, on my stream.

6313
08:03:53,080 --> 08:03:55,660
They're like actual toxic ass behavior.

6314
08:04:01,900 --> 08:04:04,140
Sorry, I'm being a little bit of a downer.

6315
08:04:04,600 --> 08:04:05,720
I just don't like that.

6316
08:04:07,480 --> 08:04:09,340
I'm just trying to fucking chill.

6317
08:04:10,660 --> 08:04:11,860
I hope they don't get top 500.

6318
08:04:14,880 --> 08:04:15,920
I hope...

6319
08:04:15,920 --> 08:04:20,440
I hope these people don't get top 500.

6320
08:04:22,180 --> 08:04:44,070
the gatekeeper continues oh crazy raccoon the crazy raccoon guy apparently like you try to hide behind another language to talk shit about me which is crazy shit honestly

6321
08:04:50,860 --> 08:04:57,360
yeah that's what I'm saying that's crazy ass behavior not crazy but that's toxic as Fuck.

6322
08:05:00,980 --> 08:05:02,540
I'm like thinking about it too much.

6323
08:05:02,980 --> 08:05:04,820
I'm gonna be positive again.

6324
08:05:05,440 --> 08:05:06,740
I'm thinking about it too much.

6325
08:05:09,180 --> 08:05:09,760
Yeah.

6326
08:05:20,220 --> 08:05:24,100
I'm gonna take the health pack real quick.

6327
08:05:25,720 --> 08:05:26,200
Fuck you.

6328
08:05:30,500 --> 08:05:31,380
I'm trying.

6329
08:05:31,480 --> 08:05:32,120
I really am.

6330
08:05:32,140 --> 08:05:34,960
I really, oh my god, I try to come over to save your ass.

6331
08:05:37,200 --> 08:05:38,440
That's so unlucky.

6332
08:05:39,300 --> 08:05:40,320
Wait, did Arluna live?

6333
08:05:40,620 --> 08:05:42,700
Oh, Luna is still being chased right now.

6334
08:05:42,900 --> 08:05:43,960
Arluna is still!

6335
08:05:44,340 --> 08:05:44,780
Arluna!

6336
08:05:45,240 --> 08:05:46,840
Oh, shit, Arluna!

6337
08:05:51,740 --> 08:05:52,220
Arluna.

6338
08:05:57,350 --> 08:05:59,910
Oh, I wish I could, like, leak shit, too.

6339
08:06:00,430 --> 08:06:07,930
Like, because I always defend crazy, like, this guy in my games, too, when I play with other people.

6340
08:06:07,950 --> 08:06:16,550
pros and I wish I didn't you know I wish I did it feeling fantastic

6341
08:06:26,550 --> 08:06:56,950
that's the thing that makes me the most upset that I defended this guy too and ranked when like other pros were talking shit about this guy and I don't even even know him that's the thing i didn't know who he was i just knew he was on crazy raccoon and i defended him to my pro friends and i was like he's on crazy raccoon like that makes me a bit more that's why i'm like extra yeah

6342
08:07:02,610 --> 08:07:07,270
spill the tea no um i won't

6343
08:07:21,520 --> 08:07:30,620
60 seconds does he know I'm here oh my gosh there's that

6344
08:07:34,490 --> 08:07:38,850
sucks cuz I have to use that

6345
08:07:44,030 --> 08:07:47,910
that sucks you

6346
08:07:51,680 --> 08:07:55,320
might need to use them for later Ah, thank you for the super chat.

6347
08:07:55,540 --> 08:07:56,100
Thank you, thank you.

6348
08:07:56,120 --> 08:07:56,380
Oh, sorry.

6349
08:07:56,460 --> 08:07:56,620
So super.

6350
08:07:56,940 --> 08:07:58,200
Thank you, my dear one.

6351
08:07:58,420 --> 08:07:58,740
So thank you.

6352
08:07:59,440 --> 08:07:59,600
Thank you.

6353
08:08:03,820 --> 08:08:04,420
That's insane.

6354
08:08:04,480 --> 08:08:06,760
I feel like I need to stop defending people.

6355
08:08:06,920 --> 08:08:07,840
I don't know.

6356
08:08:10,080 --> 08:08:12,420
Just because of, like, what?

6357
08:08:12,640 --> 08:08:13,260
I don't know.

6358
08:08:13,980 --> 08:08:15,520
Just because of, like, who they are.

6359
08:08:15,640 --> 08:08:15,940
Like, what?

6360
08:08:16,320 --> 08:08:16,400
What?

6361
08:08:16,540 --> 08:08:18,140
Because I respect Crazy Raccoon.

6362
08:08:20,100 --> 08:08:21,860
But I'm gonna stop that.

6363
08:08:22,240 --> 08:08:23,420
I'm gonna stop doing that.

6364
08:08:26,040 --> 08:08:34,340
Because they're just, you know, I assume they'd be like professional, but they're clearly not.

6365
08:08:35,220 --> 08:08:36,160
They're not professional.

6366
08:08:36,580 --> 08:08:37,360
Like, that's this guy.

6367
08:08:37,400 --> 08:08:40,280
I won't say all of them, but this guy is not professional.

6368
08:08:40,420 --> 08:08:42,020
We are undefeatable.

6369
08:08:45,280 --> 08:08:45,680
Yeah.

6370
08:08:53,830 --> 08:08:55,370
It's just unfortunate, you know?

6371
08:09:07,400 --> 08:09:08,600
Jesus Christ

6372
08:09:15,940 --> 08:09:25,740
I gotta make sure our Luna's okay Oh my god Where's my Luna?

6373
08:09:26,000 --> 08:09:32,420
Oh wait, my Luna's here Alright You get used to people disappointing you?

6374
08:09:33,040 --> 08:09:46,240
Yeah, I do I just need to stop that I'm too much, I'm too like not genuine I'm too emotional of a person But I've been like, I guess because I've been like, um...

6375
08:09:46,240 --> 08:09:48,180
I've been too nice to people.

6376
08:09:51,180 --> 08:09:56,520
That like, it's like hurt me more, more than benefiting me.

6377
08:10:03,060 --> 08:10:05,560
Yeah, it like bites me in the ass, exactly.

6378
08:10:07,720 --> 08:10:08,860
100% agree.

6379
08:10:13,220 --> 08:10:18,660
I knew you we weren't getting one guy ready Okay

6380
08:10:33,300 --> 08:10:40,920
I'm not dead I'm not dead I might be dead now I might not dead

6381
08:10:44,260 --> 08:11:08,880
I'm not dead that's fine it's okay we're not dead yet we're not dead yet there we go Jesus how long is this match oh

6382
08:11:11,970 --> 08:11:21,640
my god oh this is oh no

6383
08:11:25,220 --> 08:11:25,980
Yeah.

6384
08:11:27,040 --> 08:11:28,560
Not worth my energy.

6385
08:11:28,780 --> 08:11:29,480
No, first real.

6386
08:11:29,740 --> 08:11:30,560
I agree.

6387
08:11:31,520 --> 08:11:33,440
Iris, not worth my energy.

6388
08:11:37,690 --> 08:11:38,730
Those games are hard.

6389
08:11:39,150 --> 08:11:39,910
Holy shit.

6390
08:11:42,650 --> 08:11:44,550
Sorry about the downer mood there.

6391
08:11:45,210 --> 08:11:46,070
That just hurts.

6392
08:11:46,670 --> 08:11:47,810
It really hurts.

6393
08:11:48,230 --> 08:11:49,310
It really hurts there.

6394
08:11:54,800 --> 08:11:56,660
We're gonna reset ourselves.

6395
08:11:57,440 --> 08:12:58,500
set ourselves here sucks losing a lot we lose so much for those where we set ourselves here i just had to like vent that out i had to vent that out earlier because like it just hurts a bit because i defended like crazy raccoon players against other pros um because i know crazy raccoon the org and i respect the lot of players i respect the org and i respect like a lot of the players and i will say a lot of na players would like they'd like to talk about other players and then like i've gone against crazy raccoon and i have crazy raccoon players on my team and then like i would have like na players that would just like talk about them and then i would defend them to them i'd be like they're I think they're good.

6396
08:12:58,640 --> 08:12:59,880
I'd be like, they won Ignite.

6397
08:13:00,100 --> 08:13:04,580
They won um uh they won Ignite.

6398
08:13:04,980 --> 08:13:12,820
And I was like they won Ignite and I was like they should be good because they've done accomplished these things and I respect the org.

6399
08:13:13,280 --> 08:13:26,660
And I've defended the org and everything and I've defended um the players so it just hurts a lot more knowing that these are the attitudes of their players of this particular player.

6400
08:13:27,160 --> 08:13:58,840
Because I like they all got here um you know they all like got here on their own and everything too so it's like um they have the skill to be there and then so i like defended them to like some of the na pro scenes from the na pro players and so it hurts a lot more that this is the these are the this is this is a player from crazy raccoon um and the fact that he hid behind another language on my stream.

6401
08:13:59,200 --> 08:14:00,080
You know, all of this...

6402
08:14:00,080 --> 08:14:04,900
I hid behind another language to talk shit about me.

6403
08:14:05,360 --> 08:14:08,220
Even though I defended them behind the scenes.

6404
08:14:10,500 --> 08:14:12,520
To, like, the pro scene.

6405
08:14:13,120 --> 08:14:15,120
Like, whenever I play with, like, pro players.

6406
08:14:16,540 --> 08:14:19,100
So that's why I'm, like, it just hurts a lot more.

6407
08:14:19,200 --> 08:14:19,600
And I just...

6408
08:14:19,600 --> 08:14:21,700
It just sucks that he hid behind another language.

6409
08:14:23,520 --> 08:14:24,740
It's just so scummy.

6410
08:14:29,850 --> 08:15:47,550
like that's the thing i didn't really want to talk about but like after that i'm like fuck that if you're gonna hide behind another language to talk shit about me um on my stream by the way and say why am i here why is she here like she doesn't deserve to be in this ring and i'm like i literally won like several like on stream several games and a row solo queue to be fair there's like i would say i would say there were some games that i didn't deserve winning because i was getting picked non-stop but it was also like it was so out of my control because um i was not i was playing a support that requires peel yeah yeah if you're gonna talk shit do it to my fucking face that's what pisses me off the most i would be less mad I would be less fucking mad if um uh um if he said it in English but he said it in another language and if he did that to any other streamer like if it was a Japanese streamer or a Korean streamer and he did that to a Japanese streamer or Japanese VTuber or Korean

6411
08:15:47,550 --> 08:15:54,530
VTuber or Korean streamer have a lot of controversy that would happen there

6412
08:15:58,390 --> 08:16:41,610
would actually be like um people would get really mad sorry that like woke me up a lot really why because like um because it's all about respect it's all about respect to other content creators because if he did that to like like imagine if he said like i like if he said that if he's like uh because i've had i've seen like experiences where um i've read experiences where like uh players would have to like issue apologies because it's just very disrespectful you know

6413
08:16:49,220 --> 08:17:01,480
uh rusty they give a tier one sub thank you thank you hash brown they give a tier one sub thank you thank you get in n8 you can get away with it in n8 you can get away because everybody talks shit all the time yeah And you can talk shit.

6414
08:17:01,680 --> 08:17:04,700
Like, in NA, you can talk shit about anyone anytime.

6415
08:17:04,820 --> 08:17:07,360
Like, I've talked shit about other people and everything all the time.

6416
08:17:07,600 --> 08:17:08,600
But it's like...

6417
08:17:10,200 --> 08:17:13,800
But just hiding behind the language things really pissed me off.

6418
08:17:14,980 --> 08:17:16,680
Because, like, assuming I don't know how to recreate.

6419
08:17:17,640 --> 08:17:18,260
Which I don't!

6420
08:17:18,340 --> 08:17:19,480
But I have people again.

6421
08:17:36,130 --> 08:17:38,250
Go against them non-stop.

6422
08:17:38,490 --> 08:17:40,210
And they are just banning your fist.

6423
08:17:40,950 --> 08:17:41,410
Fist.

6424
08:17:41,670 --> 08:17:42,310
Your fist.

6425
08:17:42,430 --> 08:17:44,030
I think I might solo.

6426
08:17:46,110 --> 08:18:15,290
it might be better to just so it might be better to just uh hue dodge or solo because that's actually frustrating too i'm luna snow 30 seconds before you attack get ready yeah shouldn't we both be retired by now cap not as long as there's still a brighter tomorrow to setting here.

6427
08:18:15,870 --> 08:18:16,990
I really just dodged them.

6428
08:18:17,150 --> 08:18:28,000
I hate like, uh, yeah, but, um, Choppa didn't even defend me.

6429
08:18:28,320 --> 08:18:29,100
That's the thing.

6430
08:18:29,300 --> 08:18:30,560
I thought he was a homie.

6431
08:18:32,680 --> 08:18:33,220
Oh well.

6432
08:18:36,160 --> 08:18:37,840
So that's what made me me.

6433
08:18:48,350 --> 08:18:49,650
But yeah, I'm gonna reset myself.

6434
08:18:49,990 --> 08:19:03,560
Um, after this game has been fucking going against them too all right after after i will reset myself after this game just because like i said we're going against them

6435
08:19:18,160 --> 08:19:23,540
one more angry round i don't know look see he goes triple support

6436
08:19:29,220 --> 08:19:29,800
Yep.

6437
08:19:30,960 --> 08:19:33,480
Never goes triple support when on my team.

6438
08:19:36,220 --> 08:19:37,380
Unless he...

6439
08:19:42,180 --> 08:19:43,340
I'm okay though.

6440
08:19:44,800 --> 08:19:45,720
Sorry about that guys.

6441
08:19:45,880 --> 08:19:47,060
I know that I try not.

6442
08:19:47,320 --> 08:19:49,900
I normally am never like this, but that's just...

6443
08:19:51,920 --> 08:19:53,900
It actually just...

6444
08:19:55,780 --> 08:19:57,000
Makes me so...

6445
08:19:57,000 --> 08:19:58,160
Not tilted?

6446
08:20:00,540 --> 08:20:01,700
But like...

6447
08:20:01,700 --> 08:20:03,180
That's a lot of all.

6448
08:20:04,300 --> 08:20:05,520
Wait, and a gentle?

6449
08:20:06,220 --> 08:20:07,060
That's... Oh, look!

6450
08:20:07,220 --> 08:20:07,400
See?

6451
08:20:07,720 --> 08:20:08,740
He goes triple support.

6452
08:20:10,020 --> 08:20:11,220
He goes triple support.

6453
08:20:11,860 --> 08:20:12,840
Yeah, I guess I'm retarded.

6454
08:20:13,160 --> 08:20:14,620
I've still got songs to sing.

6455
08:20:17,600 --> 08:20:19,500
That's actually so scummy behavior.

6456
08:20:19,600 --> 08:20:24,160
He doesn't go triple support when he was on my team.

6457
08:20:25,460 --> 08:20:26,700
That's so scummy.

6458
08:20:27,000 --> 08:20:28,440
We are a little scummy.

6459
08:20:33,440 --> 08:20:37,470
Yeah, that's how much he wants to beat me or some shit or farm me

6460
08:20:50,270 --> 08:20:56,060
He wants to like he wants top 500 so fucking bad, but like when I was on

6461
08:20:59,410 --> 08:21:05,850
When I when he was on my team he refused to go triple support Is that crazy

6462
08:21:13,580 --> 08:21:22,000
There's no point in throwing Luna all against a storm because he's just gonna eat it.

6463
08:21:23,120 --> 08:21:25,900
So I have to Luna all everything but the storm.

6464
08:21:34,030 --> 08:21:35,470
Yeah, what's the context?

6465
08:21:35,630 --> 08:21:37,490
Just very disrespectful things.

6466
08:21:48,000 --> 08:21:48,820
But yeah, I'm gonna try.

6467
08:21:49,200 --> 08:21:51,540
I'm gonna present myself after this game.

6468
08:21:56,200 --> 08:21:56,840
Okay.

6469
08:21:56,860 --> 08:21:58,740
Oh it's because we're against them again.

6470
08:21:58,880 --> 08:22:03,960
I wanted to pew dodge because it's just not fun because they're just Target banning.

6471
08:22:04,000 --> 08:22:17,120
They're just target banning rocket and like this guy is purposely trying his fucking ass off um Against me, but he refused to play triple support Early like when he was on my team

6472
08:22:27,570 --> 08:22:34,090
Bye They're just gonna they're just gonna eat us up

6473
08:22:38,940 --> 08:22:39,960
Yes, he is.

6474
08:22:40,120 --> 08:22:41,460
They're just gonna do the Sharknado.

6475
08:22:42,060 --> 08:22:43,180
Oh, we killed him before.

6476
08:22:43,740 --> 08:22:44,300
Thank god.

6477
08:22:44,940 --> 08:22:48,020
Hey, can we kill this fucking Venom?

6478
08:22:50,020 --> 08:22:52,060
That Jesus Christ.

6479
08:22:52,620 --> 08:22:54,900
I was on that venom for 20 years.

6480
08:22:56,140 --> 08:22:57,220
We report them.

6481
08:22:57,560 --> 08:22:58,840
It's not reportable.

6482
08:22:59,120 --> 08:23:00,020
He's just being an asshole.

6483
08:23:02,800 --> 08:23:03,440
That's really it.

6484
08:23:04,640 --> 08:23:06,700
He can't report someone for being an asshole.

6485
08:23:22,560 --> 08:23:23,820
There we go.

6486
08:23:29,600 --> 08:23:31,300
It's just like that.

6487
08:23:45,460 --> 08:23:46,520
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh.

6488
08:23:48,200 --> 08:23:50,980
I'm gonna tell, like, my friend about it, though.

6489
08:23:52,940 --> 08:23:54,820
I'd be like, you were right.

6490
08:23:57,940 --> 08:23:59,840
That was like, you're right.

6491
08:24:02,780 --> 08:24:03,700
I won't.

6492
08:24:11,720 --> 08:24:12,660
There you go.

6493
08:24:24,540 --> 08:24:26,380
Okay, I'm just gonna clap.

6494
08:24:26,520 --> 08:24:26,940
I clap.

6495
08:24:27,160 --> 08:24:27,620
I clap.

6496
08:24:27,860 --> 08:24:28,260
I clap.

6497
08:24:29,100 --> 08:24:30,100
I keep clapping.

6498
08:24:30,700 --> 08:24:31,380
Here you go.

6499
08:24:31,740 --> 08:24:32,460
Here's your thing.

6500
08:24:33,500 --> 08:24:34,400
Where's the storm?

6501
08:24:34,860 --> 08:24:34,980
I'm scared.

6502
08:24:35,120 --> 08:24:36,140
I'm so scared.

6503
08:24:40,080 --> 08:24:41,340
I'm so scared.

6504
08:24:42,640 --> 08:24:43,620
Where's the storm?

6505
08:24:44,060 --> 08:24:45,720
Hey guys, can we still kill?

6506
08:24:47,600 --> 08:24:49,100
Can we please kill him?

6507
08:24:49,760 --> 08:24:51,380
I swear, it's just him.

6508
08:24:55,060 --> 08:24:55,860
Are they gonna TP?

6509
08:24:56,180 --> 08:24:56,840
No, they're not.

6510
08:25:00,060 --> 08:25:01,380
I'm so healthy.

6511
08:25:10,290 --> 08:25:12,050
All right, here I'll go.

6512
08:25:14,210 --> 08:25:15,670

6513
08:25:15,950 --> 08:25:16,830
Please don't die, dude.

6514
08:25:17,210 --> 08:25:18,930
Please don't die That's okay.

6515
08:25:19,090 --> 08:25:22,350
He can't die Okay, wait he might be dead.

6516
08:25:22,850 --> 08:25:23,550
Oh my god.

6517
08:25:23,750 --> 08:25:30,210
This might be it for my team I'm trying so hard to kill him.

6518
08:25:30,350 --> 08:25:37,950
Thank god Thank god Thank fucking guy Wait, are you okay?

6519
08:25:38,090 --> 08:25:38,510

You're so healthy sir.

6521
08:25:40,190 --> 08:25:46,650
You're so healthy I don't know how we live that, but I've always believed in them.

6522
08:25:47,590 --> 08:25:48,510
I don't know.

6523
08:25:48,910 --> 08:25:50,710
I don't know how we live through that.

6524
08:25:51,210 --> 08:25:52,510
But I've always believed.

6525
08:25:52,990 --> 08:25:54,510
I didn't, but like...

6526
08:25:55,390 --> 08:25:56,910
I've always believed.

6527
08:26:00,170 --> 08:26:02,570
I would like to think that I believed.

6528
08:26:04,930 --> 08:26:08,710
Oh, we go.

6529
08:26:09,370 --> 08:26:11,270
Why can't we be friends?

6530
08:26:11,730 --> 08:26:12,490
Why can't we...

6531
08:26:12,510 --> 08:26:15,870

6534
08:26:44,110 --> 08:26:46,330
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

6535
08:26:46,590 --> 08:26:48,170
The right heroes could make all the difference.

6536
08:26:48,190 --> 08:26:50,410
Because we don't have Jeff or Jeff player.

6537
08:27:11,720 --> 08:27:12,760
Round two.

6538
08:27:13,080 --> 08:27:14,500
Music makes people happy.

6539
08:27:15,140 --> 08:27:15,960
Heroes make them safe.

6540
08:27:16,820 --> 08:27:17,740
Maybe I can do that.

6541
08:27:17,740 --> 08:27:19,580
Sorry, I had to reply to a work message.

6542
08:27:20,220 --> 08:27:20,860
Good boy!

6543
08:27:21,300 --> 08:27:21,640
Jeff!

6544
08:27:21,980 --> 08:27:23,200
Good boy!

6545
08:27:24,140 --> 08:27:25,640
Who's a good boy?

6546
08:27:25,880 --> 08:27:26,860
My Jeff is.

6547
08:27:27,460 --> 08:27:29,620
Because it's like, oh my god, this is my...

6548
08:27:29,620 --> 08:27:30,340
I'm, like, not tired.

6549
08:27:30,400 --> 08:27:30,960
This is bad.

6550
08:27:35,260 --> 08:27:37,700
Might not get us through this one.

6551
08:27:37,900 --> 08:27:41,020
The battle

6552
08:27:51,120 --> 08:27:55,360
starts in five, four, three, two, one.

6553
08:27:57,280 --> 08:27:59,400
You have to stop them from the situation area.

6554
08:28:00,040 --> 08:28:02,700
He hears?

6555
08:28:02,840 --> 08:28:03,860
Wait, what is he doing?

6556
08:28:03,980 --> 08:28:04,660
What was he doing?

6557
08:28:05,000 --> 08:28:06,600
I had to do a work message.

6558
08:28:08,620 --> 08:28:09,500
You replied?

6559
08:28:09,620 --> 08:28:10,220
What do you say?

6560
08:28:12,840 --> 08:28:13,960
What did you say?

6561
08:28:20,750 --> 08:28:28,990
I didn't see it Oh, okay Oh my god, I'm trying Oh my god, I'm sorry I'm sorry, I got distracted I'm so sorry

6562
08:28:32,970 --> 08:28:34,710
I'm sorry, I got distracted

6563
08:28:41,810 --> 08:28:51,690
Don't worry, Jeff We'll live Oh Don't worry, I live, I'm sorry I live, I guess.

6564
08:28:55,430 --> 08:28:56,550
I don't think we can touch.

6565
08:28:58,250 --> 08:28:58,990
Oh, okay.

6566
08:28:59,950 --> 08:29:00,570
Never mind.

6567
08:29:01,850 --> 08:29:02,510
Never mind.

6568
08:29:13,610 --> 08:29:23,150
Oh my god, I told the friend about, like, one of my friends who was, like, talking shit about, like, and then he was, like, a fucking corset was the CR player.

6569
08:29:30,770 --> 08:29:31,170
Damn.

6570
08:29:34,490 --> 08:29:35,130
That's unlucky.

6571
08:29:36,110 --> 08:29:36,790
Oh, not yet!

6572
08:29:37,630 --> 08:29:37,750
Oh!

6573
08:29:45,360 --> 08:29:46,340
There you go.

6574
08:29:47,720 --> 08:29:48,420
Um, it's okay.

6575
08:29:49,260 --> 08:29:50,780
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

6576
08:29:51,220 --> 08:29:53,180
We just don't have any more ults now.

6577
08:29:58,100 --> 08:29:59,680
We just don't have any ults here.

6578
08:30:00,800 --> 08:30:01,600
It's unfortunate.

6579
08:30:08,600 --> 08:30:09,700
Okay, that's fine.

6580
08:30:10,480 --> 08:30:11,400
I'm coming back.

6581
08:30:11,640 --> 08:30:13,320
I don't know if I should stay in Viz.

6582
08:30:13,760 --> 08:30:16,140
I mean, if I should stay there and I'll go in Viz at this point.

6583
08:30:27,060 --> 08:30:28,820
Like, I don't even know what I can play.

6584
08:30:29,000 --> 08:30:29,400
I don't know.

6585
08:30:29,520 --> 08:30:30,060
Do I stay?

6586
08:30:30,160 --> 08:30:31,020
Go in Viz?

6587
08:30:32,380 --> 08:30:33,120
And then this is...

6588
08:30:33,120 --> 08:30:34,240
Yeah, I feel like I should.

6589
08:30:36,020 --> 08:30:37,180
I'm just going to go in Viz.

6590
08:30:47,500 --> 08:30:47,860

I'm back in the fight.

Uh, we're so not- we're so...

6602
08:33:27,220 --> 08:33:29,460
Oh, this is bad.

I don't know what you got.

6604
08:33:34,710 --> 08:33:36,310
Oh my god.

6605
08:33:36,490 --> 08:33:36,710

Okay.

6609
08:33:41,150 --> 08:33:43,050
No, no, that's not us at that point.

6610
08:33:43,750 --> 08:33:44,930
Oh my god.

6611
08:33:45,150 --> 08:33:47,310
That guy is stupid as hell.

6612
08:33:51,080 --> 08:33:54,680
That was stupid as hell.

6613
08:33:54,880 --> 08:33:56,040
I don't know.

6614
08:33:57,580 --> 08:33:58,280
I don't know.

6615
08:33:58,440 --> 08:34:00,460
That was so dumb.

6616
08:34:00,840 --> 08:34:02,000
That was actually.

6617
08:34:03,220 --> 08:34:05,640
That was so dumb.

6618
08:34:06,080 --> 08:34:06,800
What the?

6619
08:34:06,940 --> 08:34:07,720
Fuck!

6620
08:34:08,420 --> 08:34:11,060
What did I see there?

6621
08:34:11,520 --> 08:34:13,260
Oh my god!

6622
08:34:15,980 --> 08:34:19,460
Alright, if we lose this game, I know it's not me at this point.

6623
08:34:20,040 --> 08:34:20,480
I...

6624
08:34:20,480 --> 08:34:26,830
I know it's not me.

6625
08:34:30,410 --> 08:34:31,050
Like...

6626
08:34:31,050 --> 08:34:35,010
Because that was actually the most dumbest shit I've ever seen.

6627
08:34:36,230 --> 08:34:36,950
Oh no.

6628
08:34:37,330 --> 08:34:38,610
I need to get high ground.

6629
08:34:39,550 --> 08:34:41,410
And he took the chance.

6630
08:34:41,930 --> 08:34:46,290
Might not been the most calculative chance, but he took it for sure.

6631
08:34:46,650 --> 08:34:51,890
He for sure took it right there.

6632
08:34:56,310 --> 08:34:59,670
Leave it for me.

6633
08:34:59,770 --> 08:35:00,410
I want him.

6634
08:35:00,730 --> 08:35:04,590
I want that kill.

6635
08:35:04,690 --> 08:35:05,590
Give this man.

6636
08:35:06,010 --> 08:35:06,930
Give it to me.

6637
08:35:22,360 --> 08:35:22,960
Goodbye.

6638
08:35:29,820 --> 08:35:31,020
Well, does anyone get hit?

6639
08:35:31,160 --> 08:35:32,840
I don't think so.

6640
08:35:33,760 --> 08:35:37,980
Three, four, three, two, one.

6641
08:35:38,780 --> 08:35:39,400
We can win.

6642
08:35:41,160 --> 08:35:43,280
The thing is that blow-up now.

6643
08:35:43,860 --> 08:35:44,840
Oh, there it is.

6644
08:35:45,600 --> 08:35:45,680
Oh.

6645
08:35:47,100 --> 08:35:48,180
There we go.

6646
08:35:53,120 --> 08:35:53,860
Get him at him!

6647
08:35:56,500 --> 08:35:57,300
Yay!

6648
08:35:58,240 --> 08:35:58,460
Let

6649
08:36:02,610 --> 08:36:05,390
me add him!

6650
08:36:05,710 --> 08:36:06,630
Okay, there you go.

6651
08:36:07,130 --> 08:36:07,130
Yay!

6652
08:36:09,910 --> 08:36:10,710
Goodbye!

6653
08:36:15,990 --> 08:36:16,790
Oh,

6654
08:36:19,810 --> 08:36:20,110
boy!

6655
08:36:20,230 --> 08:36:22,150
Am I a good boy?

6656
08:36:24,210 --> 08:36:24,990
Bro!

6657
08:36:32,240 --> 08:36:35,780
What the fuck?

6658
08:36:36,460 --> 08:36:37,940
Where does he say that?

6659
08:36:41,500 --> 08:36:46,160
You still want to dodge the...

6660
08:36:46,580 --> 08:36:47,740
Not fun.

6661
08:36:48,520 --> 08:36:48,860
No!

6662
08:36:49,880 --> 08:36:51,280
Bad!

6663
08:36:54,960 --> 08:36:56,360
Yeah!

6664
08:37:01,000 --> 08:37:03,600
Am I good boy?

6665
08:37:04,080 --> 08:37:12,780
Oh, I know I'm a good boy.

6666
08:37:17,410 --> 08:37:24,770
That means he had my stream playing in the background while he's playing the game.

6667
08:37:27,150 --> 08:37:29,050
KK, KK.

6668
08:37:29,310 --> 08:37:29,470
K.

6669
08:37:29,470 --> 08:37:29,890
K.

6670
08:37:36,210 --> 08:37:45,750

08:37:51,490 --> 08:37:54,110

6672
08:38:29,120 --> 08:38:31,600
Yeah, really?

6673
08:38:40,600 --> 08:38:43,900
Okay, I tell him Sorry about that.

6674
08:38:44,780 --> 08:38:45,840
Okay, he apologized.

6675
08:38:47,440 --> 08:38:48,520
He is young.

6676
08:38:52,840 --> 08:38:55,100
He is young.

6677
08:38:56,160 --> 08:38:57,500
All right, I'm looking up.

6678
08:38:58,060 --> 08:39:32,200
How if I live with your sticks bitch like you understand kid he is young okay okay all right it's because you guys want to know why i told my friend i was like i understand now and then he was like my friend was like um My friend was like, yeah, that's why,

6679
08:39:32,220 --> 08:39:34,620
why, why did you defend them?

6680
08:39:35,320 --> 08:39:36,780
Because I told my friend about it, too.

6681
08:39:37,040 --> 08:39:39,640
I was doing like, I was, because I was doing business messages anyways.

6682
08:39:39,800 --> 08:39:41,740
I was like, bro, bro, this guy.

6683
08:39:42,300 --> 08:39:43,620
Remember that guy I defended?

6684
08:39:44,660 --> 08:39:48,680
And I was like, yeah, yeah, I was like, yeah, this happened.

6685
08:39:49,140 --> 08:39:51,100
And then they're like, oh, yeah.

6686
08:39:51,180 --> 08:39:54,420
And I was like, yeah, you know who was doing it, Joppa.

6687
08:39:54,800 --> 08:39:57,300
And then my friend was like, what the fuck?

6688
08:39:57,760 --> 08:39:59,920
And my friend was like, he shouldn't.

6689
08:39:59,940 --> 08:40:00,280
What?

6690
08:40:00,580 --> 08:40:02,280
My friend was like, bro, what?

6691
08:40:02,400 --> 08:40:05,940
I think he messaged Chapa and was like, bro, what the fuck?

6692
08:40:07,080 --> 08:40:09,880
That ain't homie, that ain't pro behavior.

6693
08:40:10,540 --> 08:40:16,200
Like, it's like, bro, it's like boys will be boys.

6694
08:40:17,960 --> 08:40:24,320
My friend was like mad because they're like, bro, that's not pro behavior because he's also friends with Chapa.

6695
08:40:24,920 --> 08:40:27,460
And he's like, bro, why did you let him say that to her?

6696
08:40:27,460 --> 08:40:33,380
Like, I think my friend was like, bro, why did you, like, let that guy say that to her?

6697
08:40:34,760 --> 08:40:35,240
That...

6698
08:40:35,240 --> 08:40:37,040
See, that's a good friend.

6699
08:40:37,260 --> 08:40:39,020
That's actually a good friend.

6700
08:40:39,540 --> 08:40:41,160
Because he was like, bro.

6701
08:40:42,340 --> 08:40:42,820
Like...

6702
08:40:45,380 --> 08:40:52,740
Because my friend was, like, being a good friend, and was like, bro, like, why the fuck did you let that happen?

6703
08:40:53,200 --> 08:40:55,300
He was like, you do know she's streaming, right?

6704
08:40:55,820 --> 08:40:56,300
Like...

6705
08:40:58,320 --> 08:41:00,660
So, like, he called him out about it.

6706
08:41:00,760 --> 08:41:02,800
And that's why he, I think that's why he messaged me.

6707
08:41:06,340 --> 08:41:06,660
Yeah.

6708
08:41:07,080 --> 08:41:07,800
All right, let's see.

6709
08:41:07,880 --> 08:41:09,380
Let's see how old this kid is.

6710
08:41:10,000 --> 08:41:11,180
He is young.

6711
08:41:14,640 --> 08:41:17,280
He's old enough, not good enough reason.

6712
08:41:17,400 --> 08:41:18,400
It's just respect.

6713
08:41:18,480 --> 08:41:21,160
It's all about respect in general.

6714
08:41:23,100 --> 08:41:24,380
It's just an Asia thing.

6715
08:41:24,440 --> 08:41:26,200
Like, I would assume, because that's the thing.

6716
08:41:26,300 --> 08:42:48,040
For me, um it's just because like i was in an asian company so like i would never like talk about like other like like like and grinding like n8 we can handle toxic if you guys didn't know if you guys didn't know some japanese companies japanese vtuber companies and like eastward companies you are not allowed to be toxic to anyone because if you are you actually can get warnings or like a suspension um even in rank yeah even in rank you are not allowed to be toxic towards like others in like asia servers in terms of like if you are a professional especially if you're like i would say that there is a jp uh there's like several jp video companies that it's a rule because like i remember looking at it and i was um because i was asked about na na stuff and they had that rule it is a big company they had that rule and they were trying to implement that into na vtubers and i was like you can't do that because na is all about like talking shit and all of that shit so that's why i lost a lot

6717
08:42:48,040 --> 08:42:59,900
of respect because like i hold like players in asia to like because i know it's a rule yeah i know I know it's a rule, but I don't know about CR.

6718
08:43:00,080 --> 08:43:02,620
I know, like, some VTuber companies and stuff.

6719
08:43:03,880 --> 08:43:05,800
So I told them, you have to get rid of that rule.

6720
08:43:07,740 --> 08:43:09,180
Because, like, NA is all about it.

6721
08:43:09,340 --> 08:43:11,420
And I'm like, I can, you know, it's talking shit and all that.

6722
08:43:11,580 --> 08:43:11,780
It's fine.

6723
08:43:12,000 --> 08:43:13,880
But hiding behind the language to talk shit.

6724
08:43:14,140 --> 08:43:14,640
Not cool.

6725
08:43:15,360 --> 08:43:16,680
Not cool if I...

6726
08:43:17,120 --> 08:43:19,040
That's why I got extremely more angry.

6727
08:43:21,160 --> 08:43:24,120
And then I told them, and they took the rule out, because they understood.

6728
08:43:24,380 --> 08:43:26,500
Because I was like, this is culture differences.

6729
08:43:26,500 --> 08:43:29,020
Like, I was like, this is a difference in culture.

6730
08:43:32,200 --> 08:43:38,900
Um, and they removed the rule because I was like, if you do that, you're restricting the talents to a lot of stuff.

6731
08:43:39,840 --> 08:43:39,900
Yeah.

6732
08:43:45,460 --> 08:43:50,200
Yeah, but the fact that he said it in Korean was what, like, pissed me off.

6733
08:43:50,940 --> 08:43:52,840
Thinking I can't read it.

6734
08:43:52,980 --> 08:43:54,340
Yes, but I'm also streaming.

6735
08:43:57,400 --> 08:43:59,860
That's why I was more heated up.

6736
08:43:59,880 --> 08:44:30,020
about it you know that's why I was like so heated up about it but I know shit talk is because if any people if an any pro fuck you should talk me and I'll be like I cry I cry but I know I know that it's they do it like I know it's like they I'll just be like sad but I hold a different standard towards like yeah Yeah,

6737
08:44:30,080 --> 08:44:31,420
and they say it to my face.

6738
08:44:31,560 --> 08:44:32,900
They say it to my face.

6739
08:44:35,740 --> 08:44:37,160
Yeah, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

6740
08:44:37,380 --> 08:44:38,120
Thank you, thank you.

6741
08:44:39,120 --> 08:44:40,540
It's just different, yeah.

6742
08:44:48,260 --> 08:45:03,680
That's why, like, that's why, like, it's more, yeah, it's a little bit of a lore drop and shit, but, like, it's so, like, you can understand why I'm, like, more, I, uh, I got a lot more heated up about all of that.

6743
08:45:04,520 --> 08:45:05,460
Because it just felt...

6744
08:45:05,480 --> 08:45:11,220
Like, you know, I, like, know the culture, and I know, like, the rules and stuff and everything.

6745
08:45:11,740 --> 08:45:13,040
I just think he didn't know.

6746
08:45:13,280 --> 08:45:15,240
I think he didn't know that I'm a streamer.

6747
08:45:18,580 --> 08:45:21,080
Or, like, that I know about this stuff.

6748
08:45:21,520 --> 08:45:24,100
Because I've been in that type of, like, community.

6749
08:45:24,160 --> 08:45:25,640
Like, I've been in that type of org.

6750
08:45:26,200 --> 08:45:29,360
And I've been in, like, I've seen the rules.

6751
08:45:29,820 --> 08:45:30,160
Like, yeah.

6752
08:45:39,210 --> 08:45:40,590
Um, alright, I forgot.

6753
08:45:40,710 --> 08:45:41,290
How young?

6754
08:45:42,290 --> 08:45:45,350
That's such a fucked up question to say out loud without context.

6755
08:45:46,290 --> 08:45:52,770
But for those who are wondering, Choppa apologized on behalf of him and was like, he's young.

6756
08:45:53,550 --> 08:45:55,050
He doesn't know.

6757
08:45:56,790 --> 08:45:58,270
So I'm like, all right.

6758
08:45:58,810 --> 08:45:59,630
How young?

6759
08:46:04,410 --> 08:46:07,110
It's such a crazy thing to say out loud.

6760
08:46:16,250 --> 08:46:29,250
Boys will be boys Boy doesn't even say his age How the fuck am I supposed to know How the fuck am I supposed to know Doesn't even say his age

6761
08:46:35,450 --> 08:46:38,010
He's no FBI here

6762
08:46:41,860 --> 08:46:48,520
I just hope he learns from this He's only 29 Doki I'm very young.

6763
08:46:52,240 --> 08:46:54,700
Higher or lower.

6764
08:46:56,640 --> 08:46:58,460
He's on me.

6765
08:47:00,720 --> 08:47:02,480
But I do hope he learns from it.

6766
08:47:02,560 --> 08:47:06,560
I do hope he learns from this experience.

6767
08:47:08,280 --> 08:47:10,720
Or just be more careful who you're...

6768
08:47:11,220 --> 08:47:12,520
Be more careful.

6769
08:47:30,620 --> 08:47:31,880
What you...

6770
08:47:31,900 --> 08:47:33,340
Do you think you want to be today?

6771
08:47:46,820 --> 08:47:49,780
Now, who am I going to banish from this match?

6772
08:47:56,150 --> 08:48:00,950
I'm just saying thank you to my friend who was like, you know, he didn't have...

6773
08:48:00,950 --> 08:48:02,090
God was real.

6774
08:48:02,210 --> 08:48:03,370
What happened to him?

6775
08:48:03,530 --> 08:48:03,670
What?

6776
08:48:05,890 --> 08:48:07,310
What happened to him?

6777
08:48:07,590 --> 08:48:08,390
What do you mean?

6778
08:48:08,430 --> 08:48:09,630
What do you mean was?

6779
08:48:10,230 --> 08:48:11,890
What do you mean?

6780
08:48:11,890 --> 08:48:11,890
What?

6781
08:48:14,370 --> 08:48:15,410
What happened?

6782
08:48:15,770 --> 08:48:17,290
Weapon to God!

6783
08:48:18,270 --> 08:48:20,910
He didn't get raptured.

6784
08:48:47,290 --> 08:48:49,490
The right heroes could make all the difference.

6785
08:48:52,670 --> 08:48:53,090
Alright.

6786
08:48:55,710 --> 08:48:57,570
Okay, we have a rocket player.

6787
08:48:57,830 --> 08:48:59,710
Alright, I'll go Luna so I can snowflake.

6788
08:49:00,430 --> 08:49:03,070
Rocket, the Iron Fist player.

6789
08:49:33,070 --> 08:49:33,830
Alright.

6790
08:49:35,990 --> 08:49:36,750
Alright.

6791
08:49:36,890 --> 08:49:38,590
Like, I said thank you.

6792
08:49:38,830 --> 08:49:40,030
Like, he didn't have to.

6793
08:49:40,350 --> 08:49:46,670
Like, um, you know, he didn't have to be, like, messaging a chopper and be like, what the fuck?

6794
08:49:46,810 --> 08:49:48,890
But, like, he did that on his own.

6795
08:49:49,030 --> 08:49:51,370
So I'm just, like, messaging me, like, yo, thank you.

6796
08:49:51,370 --> 08:49:52,330
He didn't have to do that.

6797
08:49:53,050 --> 08:49:54,610
I just thought it was really nice of him.

6798
08:49:54,810 --> 08:49:56,070
See, that's what I'm saying.

6799
08:49:56,890 --> 08:49:58,590
That's what a bro should do.

6800
08:49:58,930 --> 08:50:00,470
That's what homie should do.

6801
08:50:01,470 --> 08:50:04,050
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

6802
08:50:06,890 --> 08:50:31,970
to god if this guy if they're playing triple also i think dad's hungry now he's like feed me now okay i'll grab food for him later well not lit you guys know what i mean i'm just thinking because i do have like a can of food but um it's like i have a box of it somewhere i'm just trying to remember where i put it it's gonna be a bit awkward because i remember where i put the box

6803
08:50:37,690 --> 08:50:39,710
That demands food!

6804
08:50:41,130 --> 08:50:42,290
He's hungry!

6805
08:50:43,410 --> 08:50:44,970
He's so hungry!

6806
08:50:45,170 --> 08:50:45,870
Oh my god.

6807
08:50:46,570 --> 08:50:47,370
They're running triple.

6808
08:50:47,510 --> 08:50:48,590
A fucking course they are.

6809
08:50:49,110 --> 08:50:53,770
The only, the biggest issue about triple support, I said it before, but it's good long term.

6810
08:50:53,990 --> 08:50:56,150
It's a long term.

6811
08:50:57,110 --> 08:50:59,210
It's really good for long term.

6812
08:51:06,950 --> 08:51:10,430
Like, because they just have all the advantage over us.

6813
08:51:11,810 --> 08:51:43,630

6815
08:51:46,550 --> 08:51:48,290
Oh no, this is bad.

6816
08:51:48,470 --> 08:51:48,970
This is bad.

6817
08:51:49,250 --> 08:51:49,630
This is bad.

6818
08:51:49,810 --> 08:51:50,730
This is very bad.

6819
08:51:51,010 --> 08:51:51,590
This is bad.

6820
08:51:51,890 --> 08:51:52,370
This is bad.

6821
08:51:54,110 --> 08:51:55,530
We lost him.

6822
08:51:56,450 --> 08:51:57,470
This is very bad.

6823
08:51:59,850 --> 08:52:01,150
This is so bad.

6824
08:52:01,570 --> 08:52:02,210
Please, please that.

6825
08:52:02,370 --> 08:52:03,230
I'm having...

6826
08:52:03,230 --> 08:52:05,170
This is a scary match right now.

6827
08:52:06,310 --> 08:52:06,530
No!

6828
08:52:06,910 --> 08:52:07,210
No!

6829
08:52:07,790 --> 08:52:08,190
No!

6830
08:52:08,690 --> 08:52:10,170
Oh my god, yes!

6831
08:52:14,310 --> 08:52:17,430
Oh my god, oh my god, bro.

6832
08:52:20,650 --> 08:52:21,410
I got hit.

6833
08:52:22,730 --> 08:52:26,390
I got hit there.

6834
08:52:27,070 --> 08:52:28,570
Glad was distracting me.

6835
08:52:30,190 --> 08:52:31,670
Oh, that's so awkward.

6836
08:52:32,110 --> 08:52:35,850
I got so distracted by him barking.

6837
08:52:38,210 --> 08:52:39,450
I feel bad.

6838
08:52:39,710 --> 08:52:41,010
I actually got so distracted.

6839
08:52:41,950 --> 08:52:44,830
With him kicking or yapping in my ear.

6840
08:52:46,610 --> 08:52:48,190
No, we got him!

6841
08:52:49,010 --> 08:52:50,400
I'll die with the team.

6842
08:52:58,170 --> 08:52:59,550
You got this, bro.

6843
08:53:02,510 --> 08:53:03,890
You got this.

6844
08:53:03,970 --> 08:53:05,130
Oh my god, it's so loud.

6845
08:53:05,250 --> 08:53:05,710
It's so loud.

6846
08:53:05,910 --> 08:53:06,350
It's so loud.

6847
08:53:06,650 --> 08:53:07,290
It's so loud.

6848
08:53:07,390 --> 08:53:08,310
I'm so sorry.

6849
08:53:08,930 --> 08:53:09,470
I'm so...

6850
08:53:10,410 --> 08:53:10,890
Please.

6851
08:53:12,730 --> 08:53:13,430
Oh my.

6852
08:53:13,470 --> 08:53:14,550
Oh my god, it's so loud.

6853
08:53:14,810 --> 08:53:16,910
Oh my god, I can't focus.

6854
08:53:17,730 --> 08:53:18,210
Stop!

6855
08:53:19,210 --> 08:53:21,790
I'll feed you soon!

6856
08:53:22,450 --> 08:53:23,070
Stop!

6857
08:53:24,910 --> 08:53:25,510
Please!

6858
08:53:27,030 --> 08:53:29,310
He's next to me!

6859
08:53:29,990 --> 08:53:31,970
He's next to me!

6860
08:53:32,610 --> 08:53:33,050
Stop!

6861
08:53:35,250 --> 08:53:37,790
I can't focus!

6862
08:53:41,390 --> 08:53:45,210
Oh my god, I have to I actually can't focus right now.

6863
08:53:45,710 --> 08:53:47,190
Oh my god.

6864
08:53:49,130 --> 08:53:50,750
I can't focus.

6865
08:53:51,130 --> 08:53:51,550
He's just...

6866
08:53:52,010 --> 08:53:53,210
He keeps barking.

6867
08:53:54,670 --> 08:53:55,970
I'm trying my best.

6868
08:53:57,370 --> 08:53:58,890
Thanks so much.

6869
08:54:01,930 --> 08:54:02,690
Okay.

6870
08:54:04,190 --> 08:54:05,410
Oh my god.

6871
08:54:06,290 --> 08:54:10,190
Like I said, long term wise, it's just so much better long term.

6872
08:54:21,030 --> 08:54:23,370
This is so bad for me.

6873
08:54:24,210 --> 08:54:25,630
Oh my god, please stop.

6874
08:54:26,750 --> 08:54:27,290
Please.

6875
08:54:28,490 --> 08:54:29,430
I'm trying.

6876
08:54:32,590 --> 08:54:34,370
Oh my god, I didn't see the mantis.

6877
08:54:34,610 --> 08:54:35,770
I can't hear him.

6878
08:54:35,770 --> 08:54:37,050
Please, I can't hear.

6879
08:54:37,630 --> 08:54:39,670
I can't hear him.

6880
08:54:40,010 --> 08:54:44,790
I can't hear, according to the mantis.

6881
08:54:45,790 --> 08:55:14,150
Oh He was barking I'm so sad Please I can't focus at all Oh my god, the play of the game is so loud right now Jesus Christ This sucks, this actually sucks so much This is actually, I'm actually like low-key throwing a little

Okay Jesus Christ is so aggressive.

6883
08:55:24,090 --> 08:55:25,230
I'd have to die.

6884
08:55:25,630 --> 08:55:26,310
I have to die.

6885
08:55:26,710 --> 08:55:27,210
No!

6886
08:55:27,790 --> 08:55:28,050
No!

6887
08:55:28,570 --> 08:55:29,170
Alright.

6888
08:55:29,510 --> 08:55:30,190
Oh, I can't...

6889
08:55:30,190 --> 08:55:32,210
Okay, I can speed him between...

6890
08:55:32,210 --> 08:55:33,250
Go through heels.

6891
08:55:35,450 --> 08:55:36,090
Okay.

6896
08:55:42,470 --> 08:55:44,390
I can't hear my game!

6897
08:55:44,710 --> 08:55:45,630
I like the cold!

6898
08:55:47,270 --> 08:55:49,190
We are undefeatable!

6899
08:55:58,460 --> 08:56:00,320
Okay, it's fine.

6900
08:56:03,100 --> 08:56:03,900
That's fine.

6901
08:56:08,060 --> 08:56:09,060
That's fine.

6902
08:56:10,040 --> 08:56:10,680
It's okay.

6903
08:56:11,220 --> 08:56:12,560
We can't see nine again.

6904
08:56:13,680 --> 08:56:15,040
We can't do this again.

6905
08:56:15,540 --> 08:56:17,900
We can't see nine again, everyone.

6906
08:56:20,400 --> 08:56:21,420
Oh my god.

6907
08:56:23,160 --> 08:56:24,060
We can't.

6908
08:56:24,060 --> 08:56:25,240
Oh my god, please, he's one.

6909
08:56:28,000 --> 08:56:28,460
Please.

6910
08:56:29,100 --> 08:56:31,380

Please.

6912
08:56:35,080 --> 08:56:36,920
I can't focus at all.

6913
08:56:37,040 --> 08:56:38,500
He's just barking.

6914
08:56:40,540 --> 08:56:41,840
Don't worry.

6915
08:56:42,140 --> 08:56:44,000
Why are you so hungry?

6916
08:56:44,800 --> 08:56:49,180
Why are you so... You get fed the best meals.

6917
08:56:49,840 --> 08:56:52,120
Why are you so hungry?

08:57:31,360 --> 08:57:33,600
I'm trapped.

6922
08:57:37,540 --> 08:57:38,100
Okay.

6923
08:57:42,480 --> 08:57:43,040
Okay.

6924
08:57:44,280 --> 08:57:44,400
Oh.

6925
08:57:48,820 --> 08:57:49,320
Why?

6926
08:57:49,760 --> 08:57:50,140
Why?

6927
08:57:50,380 --> 08:57:51,940
Why did he speak big man?

6928
08:57:57,320 --> 08:57:59,340
He threw my two game!

6929
08:58:13,780 --> 08:58:17,660
He actually threw by spitting me into the enemy team.

6930
08:58:17,740 --> 08:58:18,540
That's crazy.

6931
08:58:21,780 --> 08:58:24,020
That's actually crazy that he did that.

6932
08:58:24,580 --> 08:58:25,280
Oh my god.

6933
08:58:29,920 --> 08:58:31,600
Oh my god.

6934
08:58:36,100 --> 08:58:37,440
Four, three,

6935
08:58:50,410 --> 08:58:51,990
I couldn't do anything.

6936
08:58:55,870 --> 08:58:57,810
Oh my god, please.

6937
08:59:01,310 --> 08:59:02,070
Please.

6938
08:59:06,820 --> 08:59:08,160
Oh my god.

6939
08:59:10,540 --> 08:59:14,940
Jesus Christ, this is the longest fight of the century.

6940
08:59:15,960 --> 08:59:18,260
It's actually the longest fight right there.

6941
08:59:18,900 --> 08:59:20,320
Alright, I can feed him now.

6942
08:59:20,840 --> 08:59:39,560
the current score is all right here we go two three time to switch things up including which side you're on i'm luna snow like the moon i shine in darkness you'll need a top-notch team to win this one

6943
09:00:02,420 --> 09:00:08,180
round two go oh my god

6944
09:00:13,040 --> 09:00:15,480
All I ever wanted to do was sing.

6945
09:00:17,100 --> 09:00:19,500
I know he does that.

6946
09:00:20,540 --> 09:00:23,440
Um, he got perma-muted.

6947
09:00:23,960 --> 09:00:24,900
I know you, Linnie.

6948
09:00:28,320 --> 09:00:32,500
I just never expected this whole time stream has to spill over into Quinlan.

6949
09:00:33,180 --> 09:00:35,540
That's just the guy that I got muted.

6950
09:00:36,340 --> 09:00:37,240
Or out on tour.

6951
09:00:38,140 --> 09:00:38,660
Thanks, Saul.

6952
09:00:39,220 --> 09:00:40,800
You always help me keep cool under pressure.

6953
09:00:40,800 --> 09:00:41,560
Oh, the guy?

6954
09:00:42,020 --> 09:00:43,300
That's the same guy we were...

6955
09:00:43,640 --> 09:00:45,520
The devs are aware of him.

6956
09:00:47,020 --> 09:00:47,820
It's him.

6957
09:00:50,260 --> 09:00:51,520
So he got perma muted.

6958
09:00:52,380 --> 09:00:54,400
I will not perma, but he got muted.

6959
09:00:55,820 --> 09:00:56,400
Yeah, the loser.

6960
09:00:57,700 --> 09:00:59,100
Basically, he throws any...

6961
09:00:59,100 --> 09:01:01,780
He also throws games if, like, you're on rocket, too.

6962
09:01:01,880 --> 09:01:03,220
Like, he's actually just a loser.

6963
09:01:09,620 --> 09:01:10,300
That's fine.

6964
09:01:12,220 --> 09:01:13,240
I froze somebody.

6965
09:01:13,780 --> 09:01:15,040
Oh, that's unlucky.

6966
09:01:16,500 --> 09:01:17,100
I don't know.

6967
09:01:17,120 --> 09:01:17,840
who I froze.

6968
09:01:19,220 --> 09:01:20,200
This all blurs in.

6969
09:01:23,440 --> 09:01:24,020
Oh, that's unlucky.

6970
09:01:24,660 --> 09:01:26,500
It's just so much damage.

6971
09:01:30,200 --> 09:01:30,900
Oh my god.

6972
09:01:31,060 --> 09:01:32,920
I'm doing a lot of damage, though.

6973
09:01:35,340 --> 09:01:36,200
Alright, I gotta reload.

6974
09:01:36,800 --> 09:01:38,100
We can walk on Mantis Hole in a sec.

6975
09:01:42,160 --> 09:01:45,160
I just said we can walk on Mantis Hole.

6976
09:01:49,980 --> 09:01:51,440
That's unfortunate.

6977
09:01:56,900 --> 09:01:59,320
That's unfortunate there.

6978
09:02:03,280 --> 09:02:05,100
He didn't say it.

6979
09:02:05,380 --> 09:02:06,760
He did say it.

6980
09:02:07,160 --> 09:02:08,960
I mean, he did.

6981
09:02:09,460 --> 09:02:11,080
He did say it.

6982
09:02:12,160 --> 09:02:12,560
He's

6983
09:02:16,230 --> 09:02:22,710
still there, Iron Fist.

6984
09:02:25,050 --> 09:02:33,560
is he okay is he though I'm just gonna spend just try to heal him

6985
09:02:38,410 --> 09:02:54,690
oh my god I'm trying my best oh my god I it's five it's five you know we try judge jury Okay.

6986
09:02:58,750 --> 09:03:00,490
There was nothing I could do.

6987
09:03:00,630 --> 09:03:01,830
I had no other shield.

6988
09:03:05,210 --> 09:03:05,950
That's fine.

6989
09:03:08,470 --> 09:03:10,950
Like, it was just, I had to just juke.

6990
09:03:11,770 --> 09:03:13,110
He could just heal him.

6991
09:03:13,190 --> 09:03:14,410
He could just get me forever.

6992
09:03:17,550 --> 09:03:18,970
All right, it's fine.

6993
09:03:19,410 --> 09:03:19,430
What?

6994
09:03:19,670 --> 09:03:24,330
That- Is he okay?

6995
09:03:25,270 --> 09:03:25,750
Over there?

6996
09:03:26,310 --> 09:03:26,970
I don't know.

6997
09:03:27,610 --> 09:03:29,530
Oh, I don't think he was okay.

6998
09:03:29,730 --> 09:03:30,730
I-

6999
09:03:34,050 --> 09:03:36,210
Guys, I don't think he was okay.

7000
09:03:41,510 --> 09:03:42,810
Alright, it's fine.

7001
09:03:45,350 --> 09:03:46,350
Here you go.

7002
09:03:51,890 --> 09:03:53,490
He's just gonna eat our mantis.

7003
09:03:54,070 --> 09:03:56,010
But he didn't eat our mantis, so...

7004
09:03:56,310 --> 09:03:57,770
You know, it's the little things.

7005
09:04:01,950 --> 09:04:02,330
All right.

7006
09:04:02,430 --> 09:04:05,130
Oh my god, he ate both our tanks, which is a lot worse.

7007
09:04:06,390 --> 09:04:09,030
There's nothing we can do.

7008
09:04:09,130 --> 09:04:10,130
He ate both our tanks.

7009
09:04:10,690 --> 09:04:15,370
Our tanks are like, I don't know, fucking traveling around the world right now.

7010
09:04:17,610 --> 09:04:23,690
I would like it if our tanks could have, I guess, died.

7011
09:04:25,450 --> 09:04:26,410
I guess.

7012
09:04:31,070 --> 09:04:32,870
How long?

7013
09:04:32,950 --> 09:04:35,760
I think it's like 15 hours or some shit.

7014
09:04:42,860 --> 09:04:43,840
Alright.

7015
09:04:48,880 --> 09:04:49,860
Alright.

7016
09:04:50,700 --> 09:04:53,900
I don't know if this is winnable, guys.

7017
09:04:56,220 --> 09:05:00,820
Alright, it's fine.

7018
09:05:03,800 --> 09:05:05,480
It's okay, though.

7019
09:05:06,780 --> 09:05:08,880
Because we do have...

7020
09:05:11,280 --> 09:05:17,040
Yay, and then they're gonna be like yummy yummy later right there it is

7021
09:05:20,750 --> 09:05:28,120

Where's my other two supports?

7030
09:06:10,080 --> 09:06:10,400
Wait.

7031
09:06:11,840 --> 09:06:12,760

Sorry, you capped.

7038
09:06:59,700 --> 09:07:03,540
That'd be cool if we can dunk on him like they did.

7039
09:07:03,640 --> 09:07:04,720
Oh, that's fine.

7040
09:07:09,400 --> 09:07:11,900
That'd be cool if they can do the thing that they did to me.

7041
09:07:13,460 --> 09:07:15,000
That'd be so cool, you know?

7042
09:07:17,000 --> 09:07:18,280
That'd be so cool.

7043
09:07:20,320 --> 09:07:23,900
I wish, like, the enemy team went rocket, too.

7044
09:07:24,820 --> 09:07:26,020
Wait, actually, didn't he?

7045
09:07:26,120 --> 09:07:26,340
No.

7046
09:07:32,730 --> 09:07:33,970
Alright, it's fine.

7047
09:07:34,170 --> 09:07:34,930

7048
09:07:35,490 --> 09:07:37,090
And then I'm gonna get slam dunked again.

7049
09:07:40,390 --> 09:07:41,150
It's okay.

7050
09:07:41,570 --> 09:07:42,550
I have ult.

7051
09:07:42,750 --> 09:07:45,850
And I can't wait to get slam dunked yet again.

7052
09:07:46,490 --> 09:07:47,850
You know, I'm gonna push the cart.

7053
09:07:48,030 --> 09:07:48,390
Look at that.

7054
09:07:48,530 --> 09:07:49,150
He doesn't...

7055
09:07:54,180 --> 09:07:55,580
I'm so excited.

7056
09:07:58,600 --> 09:07:59,260
Watch, watch, watch.

7057
09:07:59,500 --> 09:08:00,000
Oh, oh.

7058
09:08:00,460 --> 09:08:02,000
Oh, it's because he was chasing.

7059
09:08:02,840 --> 09:08:03,940
So he didn't slam dunk.

7060
09:08:04,100 --> 09:08:05,000
That's crazy.

7061
09:08:05,680 --> 09:08:07,380
But one time he didn't slam dunk.

7062
09:08:07,500 --> 09:08:08,780
He was too busy chasing.

7063
09:08:12,580 --> 09:08:14,540
I was waiting for it too.

7064
09:08:15,340 --> 09:08:16,580
I was like, it is here.

7065
09:08:16,980 --> 09:08:17,940
The moment true.

7066
09:08:18,300 --> 09:08:19,100
The slam dunk.

7067
09:08:20,020 --> 09:08:21,340
It's a yummy, yummy time again.

7068
09:08:24,360 --> 09:08:25,160
3-11.

7069
09:08:26,140 --> 09:08:32,280
We didn't get anything out of that though, which is pretty bad because they're delaying this for a long this dude

09:08:37,990 --> 09:08:40,250

That's right.

7080
09:09:51,520 --> 09:09:53,160
All that for plus 12.

7081
09:09:53,960 --> 09:09:55,160
That's fucking right.

7082
09:09:57,500 --> 09:09:59,140
Jesus, minus 24.

7083
09:09:59,520 --> 09:10:00,920
Remember when we had this?

7084
09:10:01,040 --> 09:10:02,000
Oh, those were good.

7085
09:10:02,080 --> 09:10:03,320
Those were good old times.

7086
09:10:05,780 --> 09:10:06,900

Oh, this is the Jeff guy.

7090
09:10:50,420 --> 09:10:55,860
I think he added me to talk more shit and be like, you must have been the one that muted me.

7091
09:10:56,400 --> 09:10:58,520
I'm like, yeah, don't be a fucking asshole.

09:10:59,120 --> 09:11:00,680
Don't be...

7093
09:11:08,320 --> 09:11:09,540
No, he does.

7094
09:11:10,560 --> 09:11:12,220
Why would he randomly add me?

7095
09:11:14,260 --> 09:11:15,980
Because that guy was from yesterday.

7096
09:11:20,570 --> 09:11:21,990
Oh, fuck off.

7097
09:11:23,570 --> 09:11:24,690
Talk shit.

7098
09:11:24,850 --> 09:11:25,390
Get hit.

7099
09:11:26,330 --> 09:11:26,970
Hey,

7100
09:11:37,980 --> 09:11:38,800
that's the good boy.

7101
09:11:39,420 --> 09:11:40,000
That's him.

7102
09:11:47,630 --> 09:11:49,850
There's no Jeff hovering on our team.

7103
09:11:50,270 --> 09:11:50,970
Fan that shit.

7104
09:11:54,210 --> 09:11:55,170
That's funny.

7105
09:11:57,790 --> 09:11:58,610
You know what's crazy?

7106
09:11:58,770 --> 09:12:01,030
That guy, he appears offline too.

7107
09:12:01,230 --> 09:12:03,250
So you can't Q-Dodge him.

7108
09:12:03,810 --> 09:12:05,570
He purposely appears off that.

7109
09:12:06,610 --> 09:12:08,170
The people trying to Q-Dodge.

7110
09:12:10,370 --> 09:12:11,670
Look at that!

7111
09:12:12,290 --> 09:12:13,570
Are you watching the stream?

7112
09:12:14,010 --> 09:12:15,170
Fuck off, buddy.

7113
09:12:18,290 --> 09:12:22,010
You see I rejected him and then he instant added back.

7114
09:12:23,650 --> 09:12:24,750
Holy unemployment.

7115
09:12:25,510 --> 09:12:26,390
Look at that.

7116
09:12:26,470 --> 09:12:28,190
That's actually cringe as hell.

7117
09:12:34,340 --> 09:12:35,600
He has skull.

7118
09:12:39,380 --> 09:12:41,400
I think it's because I got him muted.

7119
09:12:41,520 --> 09:12:42,600
I don't know for how long.

7120
09:12:44,000 --> 09:12:44,420
Honestly.

7121
09:12:45,980 --> 09:12:47,820
I don't know how long he got muted for it.

7122
09:12:47,880 --> 09:12:51,040
I just know that the devs were like, oh, we'll look into it for you.

7123
09:12:53,900 --> 09:12:55,300
Buddy, you got more soul.

7124
09:12:55,340 --> 09:12:56,480
Yeah, buddy.

7125
09:12:56,760 --> 09:13:02,440
If I say ignore, you can friend request me for as many times as you want.

7126
09:13:19,880 --> 09:13:20,840
That's silly.

7127
09:13:21,520 --> 09:13:23,200
That's actually fucking hilarious.

7128
09:13:24,620 --> 09:13:27,340
Like, the fact that he, like...

7129
09:13:27,340 --> 09:13:31,060
The fact that he fucking sent another one right after.

7130
09:13:38,330 --> 09:13:39,630
That's fucking hilarious.

7131
09:13:39,790 --> 09:13:40,830
That's actually hilarious.

7132
09:13:44,150 --> 09:13:46,190
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

7133
09:13:48,090 --> 09:13:49,610
Is in seven hours?

7134
09:13:50,270 --> 09:13:56,830

Until I find another game I can play forever.

7143
09:15:48,510 --> 09:15:49,550
It's just something in my brain.

7144

7145
09:15:56,460 --> 09:15:58,320
I'm relapsing hard for real.

7146
09:15:59,540 --> 09:16:00,900
There's just something about the grind.

7147
09:16:01,780 --> 09:16:02,260
Hey pizza!

09:16:07,150 --> 09:16:09,250

09:16:09,330 --> 09:16:09,970
That's the...

7150
09:16:10,770 --> 09:16:11,570
That's the weird part.

7151
09:16:11,710 --> 09:16:12,910
I'm not tired.

7152
09:16:17,550 --> 09:16:23,930
I'm peak cheap one and I saw the emblems of...

7153
09:16:25,470 --> 09:16:26,850
What the fuck?

7154
09:16:27,590 --> 09:16:29,190
Where did he TP to?

7155
09:16:29,330 --> 09:16:30,270
Where are we?

7156
09:16:30,490 --> 09:16:31,110
Oh, okay.

7157
09:16:31,710 --> 09:16:32,670
I was so confused.

7158
09:16:32,850 --> 09:16:33,750
Like, where are we?

7159
09:16:36,330 --> 09:16:37,370
Because like...

7160
09:16:37,370 --> 09:16:38,890
Would I be like, okay?

7161
09:16:45,920 --> 09:16:46,760
Okay.

7162
09:16:48,300 --> 09:16:49,920
This TP sucks.

7163
09:16:50,300 --> 09:16:51,460
I will say.

7164
09:16:52,180 --> 09:16:54,380
This is a fucking weird-ass TP.

7165
09:16:57,440 --> 09:16:59,820
This is a weird-ass TP.

7166
09:17:06,760 --> 09:17:08,480
I don't even know how.

7167
09:17:10,000 --> 09:17:11,900
We won that?

7168
09:17:14,120 --> 09:17:15,760
What happened?

7169
09:17:17,440 --> 09:17:18,820
Never mind.

7170
09:17:18,960 --> 09:17:21,140
Maybe this TP wasn't so bad.

7171
09:17:21,300 --> 09:17:21,780
What?

7172
09:17:22,520 --> 09:17:23,240
Holy shit!

7173
09:17:30,480 --> 09:17:31,780
I spoke too soon.

7174
09:17:32,340 --> 09:17:33,380
I spoke too soon.

7175
09:17:33,880 --> 09:17:35,800
I got so confused.

7176
09:17:42,080 --> 09:17:43,220
Please, he's one.

7177
09:17:44,000 --> 09:17:45,060
Please, he's still one.

7178
09:17:45,760 --> 09:17:46,900
Oh my god, please.

7179
09:17:47,600 --> 09:17:48,560
Maybe he'll eat like...

7180
09:17:49,940 --> 09:17:50,780
Okay, there we go.

7181
09:17:51,560 --> 09:17:53,600
You always chase it.

7182
09:17:54,040 --> 09:17:56,380
Like, it was no cop just figure it out.

7183
09:17:56,540 --> 09:17:57,020
That's it.

7184
09:17:57,540 --> 09:17:59,520
It's literally figure the shit out.

7185
09:18:04,360 --> 09:18:05,580
That's our rule.

7186
09:18:06,100 --> 09:18:07,240
We figure it out.

7187
09:18:10,180 --> 09:18:13,200
All you're good for is triple sub- What?

7188
09:18:14,740 --> 09:18:15,380

7196
09:19:54,600 --> 09:19:55,600
Oh, I'm seeing me.

7197
09:19:55,840 --> 09:19:56,700
I can't freeze that.

7198
09:19:57,180 --> 09:20:00,280
It was just reflex, honestly.

09:20:02,240 --> 09:20:03,120
Hey, I got him.

7200
09:20:03,900 --> 09:20:07,000
It was just reflex when I fucking freeze that.

7201
09:20:07,120 --> 09:20:08,240

That's...

7206
09:21:30,340 --> 09:21:32,260
That's...

7207
09:21:34,260 --> 09:21:35,660
That's...

7208
09:21:35,660 --> 09:21:36,820
Oh.

7209
09:21:36,820 --> 09:21:38,460
Oh, man.

7210
09:21:39,920 --> 09:21:40,920

Oh, our poor, that poor is strange.

7215
09:21:47,660 --> 09:21:53,320
I don't think that's what he wanted to happen, guys.

7216
09:21:54,560 --> 09:22:02,120
I have a feeling that I had a feeling that that was an accident.

7217
09:22:03,140 --> 09:22:04,340
Stupid champ.

7218
09:22:05,460 --> 09:22:07,520
The worst part is that he's an ace, too.

7219
09:22:07,680 --> 09:22:09,120
That's the worst part.

7220
09:22:15,680 --> 09:22:16,880
I'm Luna Snow.

7221
09:22:17,740 --> 09:22:19,960
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

7222
09:22:20,300 --> 09:22:22,720
The right heroes could make all the difference.

7223
09:22:24,600 --> 09:22:26,840
You see how hard I'm rage baiting their DPS?

7224
09:22:28,960 --> 09:22:30,900
Like they're just going to continue to do bad.

7225
09:22:32,920 --> 09:22:34,280
See, this is N.A.

7226
09:22:34,360 --> 09:22:36,220
Toxicity right here.

09:22:37,140 --> 09:22:40,600
Literally using like rage bait as a strat.

7228
09:22:41,040 --> 09:22:43,580
He's trying to tilt the other team higher in it.

7229
09:22:43,720 --> 09:22:45,500
That's so smart!

7230
09:22:45,840 --> 09:22:46,780

09:22:53,420 --> 09:22:57,790
Only NA people would fucking... It worked so...

7233
09:23:01,920 --> 09:23:04,300
Okay, fake tactics.

7234
09:23:11,640 --> 09:23:13,380
Thank God I'm not a league player.

7235
09:23:13,480 --> 09:23:13,700

They're doing it.

7244
09:24:12,200 --> 09:24:12,640
Oh, yeah.

7245
09:24:12,760 --> 09:24:16,800
No, I know, like, because League toxicity was so bad.

7246
09:24:16,820 --> 09:24:32,960
that they started to like like you can get chat bad like instantly or like it's why they don't have voice chat it's literally the reason why they don't have vc because that's how bad the toxicity is

Got it.

7252
09:25:46,290 --> 09:25:47,330

Jesus Christ!

7255
09:25:59,480 --> 09:26:01,000
Oh my god.

7256
09:26:02,580 --> 09:26:04,940
I quit Link because it was making me a worse human.

7257
09:26:05,040 --> 09:26:06,320
That's what I'm saying!

7258
09:26:06,940 --> 09:26:12,020
It's like, it's more like, um, How come you never try League or Mova and shit like that?

7259
09:26:12,120 --> 09:26:13,520
And I'm like, bro, I...

7260
09:26:14,280 --> 09:26:15,320
I already...

7261
09:26:15,320 --> 09:26:17,600
I don't want to be even more depressed, bro.

7262
09:26:18,060 --> 09:26:21,460
I already know the shit that goes on.

7263
09:26:25,520 --> 09:26:26,440
I'm dead.

7264
09:26:27,640 --> 09:26:28,700
Goodbye, cruel world.

7265
09:26:31,100 --> 09:26:31,980
Okay, that's on me.

7266
09:26:32,140 --> 09:26:32,600
That's on me.

7267
09:26:32,700 --> 09:26:34,020
I don't think I lost any point.

7268
09:26:34,640 --> 09:26:35,460
We got it.

7269
09:26:36,520 --> 09:26:39,360
Oh my god, your mother's shot.

7270
09:26:40,460 --> 09:26:42,380
The jump one is my...

7271
09:26:43,340 --> 09:26:48,380
The jump is actually crazy.

7272
09:26:50,660 --> 09:26:52,400
Because you can't be toxic.

7273
09:26:52,860 --> 09:26:53,380
You can't...

7274
09:26:54,020 --> 09:26:56,140
You can't be, like, toxic and legal.

7275
09:26:56,220 --> 09:26:57,560
You get insta-bad now.

7276
09:26:58,100 --> 09:26:58,840
So they're like...

7277
09:26:58,840 --> 09:26:59,620
They have to...

7278
09:26:59,620 --> 09:27:00,940
Because that's how bad...

7279
09:27:00,940 --> 09:27:02,880

7280
09:27:06,360 --> 09:27:06,980

7306
09:29:42,540 --> 09:29:43,640
It was crazy.

7307
09:29:44,940 --> 09:29:47,900
I was not expecting that.

7308
09:29:48,340 --> 09:29:50,220
Another epic victory.

7309
09:29:50,780 --> 09:29:54,060
She was fighting for her life.

7310
09:29:58,210 --> 09:30:01,710
Your team wanted to respect the 1v1.

7311
09:30:05,450 --> 09:30:05,870
Yeah.

7312
09:30:07,490 --> 09:30:08,910
Plus 15?

7313
09:30:10,130 --> 09:30:11,770
What are these lobbies?

7314
09:30:17,350 --> 09:30:19,550
Actually, what are these lollabies?

7315
09:30:20,330 --> 09:30:21,010
Who's Isaac?

7316
09:30:22,050 --> 09:30:23,850
I got a game with Isaac?

7317
09:30:27,510 --> 09:30:28,910
What the fuck is Isaac?

7318
09:30:31,390 --> 09:30:32,370
Damn, this is rough.

7319
09:30:32,570 --> 09:30:34,050
Is it because, like, okay, what's the Elo?

7320
09:30:36,730 --> 09:30:37,670
Ah, Isaac.

7321
09:30:38,710 --> 09:30:40,910
Wait, there's three GM players.

7322
09:30:42,050 --> 09:30:42,850
That's rough.

7323
09:30:43,090 --> 09:30:44,250
That's actually rough.

7324
09:30:47,130 --> 09:30:47,330
That's...

7325
09:30:47,350 --> 09:30:48,130
see Celestia.

7326
09:30:48,410 --> 09:30:51,070
So I'm like, did we got a game with it?

7327
09:30:59,830 --> 09:31:01,070
I won't be late.

7328
09:31:01,770 --> 09:31:02,090
Chat.

7329
09:31:02,570 --> 09:31:03,510
I won't be late.

7330
09:31:05,010 --> 09:31:06,350
I'll be on time.

7331
09:31:08,670 --> 09:31:09,690
Don't worry.

7332
09:31:10,270 --> 09:31:11,230
No worries.

7333
09:31:11,990 --> 09:31:12,790
Be happy.

7334
09:31:20,730 --> 09:31:23,730
I heard that apparently yours don't get enough rank points.

7335
09:31:23,970 --> 09:31:24,670
Yeah, they don't.

7336
09:31:24,770 --> 09:31:25,690
I talked about it before.

7337
09:31:25,950 --> 09:31:29,730
But it's all about it's all about damage done.

7338
09:31:30,070 --> 09:31:57,570
final hits and um it's it relies on your damage done and final hits mostly they calculated off of that so you don't do enough damage and you don't do enough final hits you don't get a lot of um you don't get a lot of rank points or rank points which is very dumb very stupid not that fun should i avoid people i believe in you

7339
09:32:01,930 --> 09:32:26,290
you avoid if you have to i believe yeah that's why dps would get like 20 to 20 like 20 to 25 points and then um and then uh support players would get like 18 to 22 if they're lucky oh yeah let me see

7340
09:32:31,050 --> 09:32:42,070
okay i understand thank you for thank you for saying sorry because it made me angie

7341
09:32:49,080 --> 09:33:02,020
there you go angie is an understatement but also he really needs but also if he's going to shit talk Make sure he doesn't shit.

7342
09:33:02,100 --> 09:33:09,320
I was like, if he's going to shit talk, make sure he knows it's not someone that's streaming right now.

7343
09:33:14,280 --> 09:33:19,040
Or just shit talk to your friend, not your fucking matchat.

7344
09:33:21,820 --> 09:33:22,900
Oh yeah, that's true.

7345
09:33:23,220 --> 09:33:26,340
Tell him to use Google Translate first and say it to my face.

7346
09:33:26,780 --> 09:33:32,000
If he's going to shit talk, say it to my face and don't hide behind another language.

7347
09:33:37,480 --> 09:34:04,880
jump short simple and effective that's what i'm saying league is league lead players are so creative with their talk because they don't want to get bad because you know league accounts are like they like have league accounts for years like like maybe like decades and stuff so they're super careful and making sure they don't get bad but they can also get they But they still want to shit talk because it's the league way.

7348
09:34:09,470 --> 09:34:10,310
They're like veterans.

7349
09:34:11,230 --> 09:34:12,490
It's like baby shit.

7350
09:34:13,590 --> 09:34:18,010
If they see like Marvel, Rival, shit talk or like anything else, they're just like.

7351
09:34:18,650 --> 09:34:21,450
They're just like, that shit's for fucking babies.

7352
09:34:21,910 --> 09:34:23,350
But then I'm baby though.

7353
09:34:23,450 --> 09:34:24,190
I'm baby.

7354
09:34:24,310 --> 09:34:25,930
I'm very emotional baby.

7355
09:34:27,690 --> 09:34:29,690
I played one league game and I...

7356
09:34:29,690 --> 09:34:33,630
Oh, for those who never heard the story before, I played one league game.

7357
09:34:33,970 --> 09:34:58,010

09:35:03,970 --> 09:35:06,440
It was fun!

7359
09:35:06,580 --> 09:35:08,880
It was so... It was miserable.

7360
09:35:12,240 --> 09:35:18,200
I was just like, I'm sorry, my internet, you see, did you guys win?

7361
09:35:18,580 --> 09:35:20,460
And I was like, no, we didn't win.

7362
09:35:20,560 --> 09:35:22,260
I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry.

7363
09:35:23,340 --> 09:35:25,020
Oh, I'm so sorry.

7364
09:35:25,680 --> 09:35:26,160

7372
09:36:31,870 --> 09:36:32,750
Oh, I've been streaming.

7373
09:36:32,870 --> 09:36:34,170
I must have almost been 10 hours.

7374
09:36:34,390 --> 09:36:35,370
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.

7375
09:36:37,570 --> 09:36:37,770

I can't help it.

7378
09:36:52,530 --> 09:36:54,750
It's just so fun.

7379
09:37:13,260 --> 09:37:14,040
Okay.

7380
09:37:14,560 --> 09:37:14,720

09:37:22,380 --> 09:37:23,560

7388
09:37:32,660 --> 09:37:34,640

7389
09:37:35,240 --> 09:37:35,720
little

7390
09:37:40,300 --> 09:37:44,480
We have demons to slay what are we waiting for?

09:37:49,640 --> 09:38:52,200

Oh, this is very unfortunate indeed.

7394
09:39:23,030 --> 09:39:34,140
It's just I see my rocket die away and then I can't do anything about- I'm like, I'm- ooh, I'm tempted to go Animal Crossing just so that magic can't do anything.

7395
09:39:38,280 --> 09:39:41,430
Oh, that's... that's bad.

7396
09:39:46,260 --> 09:39:47,980

7399
09:39:56,360 --> 09:40:04,980
This might not be a... this might not be a game.

Alright, let's try.

7404
09:40:24,740 --> 09:40:26,960
Oh my god, I just want him to be alive.

7405
09:40:27,780 --> 09:40:28,140
Sucks.

7406
09:40:29,380 --> 09:40:32,160
I had to use that because I just didn't want to die.

7407
09:40:33,420 --> 09:40:35,900
I am ready to put on a show.

7408
09:40:37,680 --> 09:40:38,780
Alright, that's fine.

7409
09:40:39,380 --> 09:40:39,640

That's fine.

7413
09:40:45,860 --> 09:40:46,140
That's fine.

7414
09:40:47,480 --> 09:40:48,220
It wasn't too much.

7415
09:40:48,320 --> 09:40:48,740
Oh wait.

7416
09:40:49,200 --> 09:40:50,100

Thank god.

7418
09:40:52,300 --> 09:40:55,760
Look at your magic.

09:40:57,860 --> 09:40:58,760
Magic on a rocket.

7420
09:40:59,940 --> 09:41:00,560
You're fine.

7421
09:41:01,200 --> 09:41:03,460
But I would like to also get healed.

7422
09:41:04,620 --> 09:41:06,540
That would be pretty cool.

7423
09:41:08,000 --> 09:41:10,020
That would be pretty cool.

09:42:17,780 --> 09:42:18,320
She's still low?

7439
09:42:18,560 --> 09:42:19,600
This is so stressful.

7440
09:42:21,740 --> 09:42:23,100
Oh, I wanted that pull.

7441
09:42:23,500 --> 09:42:24,880

I just don't like people stalking my trackers and stuff.

7559
09:53:24,190 --> 09:53:24,670
It's...

7560
09:53:24,670 --> 09:53:26,910
It's just, like, personal preference.

7561
09:53:28,970 --> 09:53:31,230
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

7562
09:53:45,090 --> 09:53:50,110
Yeah, only I can stalk people.

7563
09:53:50,750 --> 09:53:51,950
That's different.

7564
09:53:54,530 --> 09:53:56,210
Only I'm allowed to stop.

7565
09:53:57,890 --> 09:54:01,170
So bitch.

7566
09:54:03,190 --> 09:54:05,270
It's my streamer privilege.

7567
09:54:05,590 --> 09:54:09,310
I demand streamer privilege and that means I can stop.

7568
09:54:12,610 --> 09:54:13,730
30 seconds.

7569
09:54:14,070 --> 09:54:16,030
So when others hide their pro- Yes!

7570
09:54:16,670 --> 09:54:17,430
Exactly.

7571
09:54:18,690 --> 09:54:19,810
They're cowards.

7572
09:54:20,430 --> 09:54:23,050
I have an excuse, I'm a streamer.

7573
09:54:23,550 --> 09:54:30,250
If I wasn't a streamer, if I wasn't a streamer, I would have it public.

7574
09:54:36,590 --> 09:54:38,910
That's all I'm saying.

7575
09:54:40,050 --> 09:54:41,730

They don't need me.

7587
09:55:10,630 --> 09:55:12,510
I think they might need me.

7588
09:55:17,160 --> 09:55:17,800
Everybody needs a hand.

7589
09:55:18,020 --> 09:55:18,180

He's gonna run the fucking lobby.

7615
09:57:25,220 --> 09:57:25,800

7635
09:59:42,610 --> 09:59:43,490
Wait, geez.

7636
09:59:48,290 --> 09:59:49,030

7637
09:59:49,850 --> 09:59:50,650
It's him.

7638
09:59:50,970 --> 09:59:51,770
Who's him?

7639
09:59:55,370 --> 09:59:56,810

7640
09:59:58,010 --> 09:59:58,170

Oh.

7646
10:00:25,420 --> 10:00:26,540
That's unfortunate.

7647
10:00:26,700 --> 10:00:27,540
Wait, where's my teammate?

7648
10:00:28,260 --> 10:00:29,680

7649
10:00:31,200 --> 10:00:31,820

10:01:46,450 --> 10:01:47,270
I mean, he's very...

7660
10:01:47,270 --> 10:01:48,550
Bro, he's...

7661
10:01:48,550 --> 10:01:49,350

7662
10:01:50,370 --> 10:01:54,070

10:01:54,070 --> 10:01:56,070
Bro, it's not...

7664
10:01:56,070 --> 10:01:56,610
What?

7665
10:01:58,730 --> 10:01:59,450
How?

7666
10:02:01,130 --> 10:02:02,970
How did you get here?

7667
10:02:05,530 --> 10:02:06,190
Oh, thank God.

7668
10:02:06,270 --> 10:02:08,030
Okay, we're taking him down with us.

7669
10:02:08,250 --> 10:02:08,550
Thank God.

7670
10:02:09,550 --> 10:02:10,590
He was trying to secure it.

7671
10:02:10,630 --> 10:02:11,330
He was almost there.

7672
10:02:11,470 --> 10:02:13,510
Guys, I'll let you know right now.

7673
10:02:13,690 --> 10:02:16,410
He was one game away from securing it.

7674
10:02:16,630 --> 10:02:18,070
Oh, thank God we brought him down.

7675
10:02:18,210 --> 10:02:19,710
Oh, thank God.

7676
10:02:24,730 --> 10:02:25,530
Thank God.

7677
10:02:26,190 --> 10:02:26,790
Thank God.

7678
10:02:28,870 --> 10:02:29,530
He was like one.

7679
10:02:29,590 --> 10:02:32,170
I think, I'm pretty sure he's like one game off.

7680
10:02:33,430 --> 10:02:35,090
Another gate has been kept.

7681
10:02:36,690 --> 10:02:38,590
Who is this guy?

7682
10:02:43,960 --> 10:02:44,940
Alright, let's see.

7683
10:02:45,660 --> 10:02:47,480
Did he open his history?

7684
10:02:47,680 --> 10:02:47,900
No.

7685
10:02:48,120 --> 10:02:50,080
I think he stopped watching, honestly.

7686
10:02:52,280 --> 10:02:54,400
He was almost You shall not pass!

7687
10:02:57,400 --> 10:03:00,440
I will not let you become top 500.

7688
10:03:01,120 --> 10:03:03,780
If it's the last thing I do.

7689
10:03:05,800 --> 10:03:08,700
I have a I might have a sponsor stream later.

7690
10:03:08,720 --> 10:03:13,420
but that's not gonna stop me from ELO terrorizing.

7691
10:03:19,420 --> 10:03:21,100
The gatekeeping is working.

7692
10:03:21,320 --> 10:03:24,640
They think I'd stop, but I didn't.

7693
10:03:29,230 --> 10:03:31,350
No one is safe from me.

7694
10:03:32,630 --> 10:03:35,010
All right, it's time to, it's time to role play.

7695
10:03:35,550 --> 10:03:36,690
It's role play time.

7696
10:03:37,350 --> 10:03:37,690
Hello.

7697
10:03:40,290 --> 10:03:41,030

7706
10:04:04,690 --> 10:04:06,010
Bum, bum, bum.

Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

7708
10:04:13,510 --> 10:04:16,190
They're dancing with me.

7709
10:04:24,780 --> 10:04:29,100
Oh my god, look at these.

7710
10:04:29,360 --> 10:04:30,420
Where are they gonna take me?

7711
10:04:31,060 --> 10:04:31,800
Where are these chefs?

7712
10:04:32,160 --> 10:04:32,460
Whoa!

7713
10:04:33,740 --> 10:04:34,260
Where are these chefs?

7714
10:04:34,440 --> 10:04:36,420
Oh, goodbye, my little chefs!

7715
10:04:37,480 --> 10:04:37,820
Goodbye.

7716
10:04:39,040 --> 10:04:41,440
Stupid, sexy mantis dancing.

7717
10:04:53,640 --> 10:04:58,780
They're taking me to the back alley to shoot, Jesus Christ.

7718
10:04:59,280 --> 10:05:01,780
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

7719
10:05:02,660 --> 10:05:03,920
Guys, remember when I said I wasn't going to stream for long?

7720
10:05:04,000 --> 10:05:05,160
I can't help it!

7721
10:05:05,420 --> 10:05:05,780
Ah!

7722
10:05:06,920 --> 10:05:09,360
I'm having so much fun, though.

7723
10:05:10,660 --> 10:05:11,800
I'm having a lot of fun.

7724
10:05:11,860 --> 10:05:13,640
I don't mean you guys are having fun, except for when I crash out.

7725
10:05:14,280 --> 10:05:17,220
But I hope you guys are having fun during my non-crash out moments.

7726
10:05:23,120 --> 10:05:24,400
I can stop whenever I want.

7727
10:05:24,880 --> 10:05:27,140
Also, it's because I'll be gone for so long.

7728
10:05:27,860 --> 10:05:29,420
I feel really bad.

7729
10:05:29,860 --> 10:05:31,660
I'm, like, taking a lot of days off.

7730
10:05:31,860 --> 10:05:33,280
Because, you know, in the past, I would just stream.

7731
10:05:33,640 --> 10:05:35,520
Like, I was a streaming monster.

7732
10:05:37,000 --> 10:05:37,800
But, like...

7733
10:05:37,800 --> 10:05:39,700
And I'll be gone for a while, too.

7734
10:05:40,200 --> 10:05:42,200
I'm going to be on a business trip.

7735
10:05:44,400 --> 10:05:46,280
No, I'll be gone from...

7736
10:05:47,580 --> 10:05:49,580
I'll be gone from...

7737
10:05:52,700 --> 10:05:53,100
From...

7738
10:05:54,540 --> 10:05:57,540
Friday to Tuesday.

7739
10:05:58,000 --> 10:05:59,360
I'll be back to streaming on Wednesday.

7740
10:06:01,720 --> 10:06:03,440
So that's why I'm like, I'm not going to be at TwitchCon.

7741
10:06:03,660 --> 10:06:05,060
I know people are wondering about me at TwitchCon.

7742
10:06:05,160 --> 10:06:06,020
It's not TwitchCon.

7743
10:06:06,580 --> 10:06:07,700
Oh, we forgot to ban stuff.

7744
10:06:07,860 --> 10:06:08,660
Fucking hell yeah.

7745
10:06:14,170 --> 10:06:18,450
But because of that, that's why I'm streaming long today.

7746
10:06:18,970 --> 10:06:21,170
It's like, I'm gonna miss you guys.

7747
10:06:25,550 --> 10:06:27,570
I shine in darkness.

7748
10:06:31,910 --> 10:06:33,670
Yeah, I love streaming for you guys.

7749
10:06:42,220 --> 10:06:44,260
I feel bad, but like...

7750
10:06:45,140 --> 10:06:46,200
I invaded it, but...

7751
10:06:47,140 --> 10:06:47,660
Um...

7752
10:06:47,660 --> 10:06:49,020
Oh my gosh!

7753
10:06:49,340 --> 10:06:51,180
I'm also gonna meet someone, too.

7754
10:06:51,880 --> 10:06:58,200
I usually don't meet other V2 varies, but during this business trip, I'm gonna like meet up with somebody.

7755
10:06:59,480 --> 10:07:02,040
So it's like gonna be really exciting, too.

7756
10:07:02,840 --> 10:07:03,300
Yeah!

7757
10:07:04,140 --> 10:07:05,340
It's gonna be someone new.

7758
10:07:06,400 --> 10:07:07,940
I've never met up with it before.

7759
10:07:08,460 --> 10:07:11,060
I also haven't met up with people before, too.

7760
10:07:11,320 --> 10:07:14,760
I think like the only, it's very rare.

7761
10:07:16,860 --> 10:07:19,180
So, so it's gonna be pretty exciting.

7762
10:07:25,100 --> 10:07:26,820
It's not TwitchCon.

7763
10:07:27,260 --> 10:07:28,780
I know people were wondering.

7764
10:07:30,420 --> 10:07:31,380
Not TwitchCon.

7765
10:07:35,030 --> 10:07:36,390
I don't know how we're gonna come up with it.

7766
10:07:37,870 --> 10:07:38,510
I'm scared.

7767

10:10:52,950 --> 10:10:54,590

This is not about aiming for top 500.

7825

We played...

8019
10:30:13,320 --> 10:30:15,100
I don't even know how long we played with Rocket.

8020
10:30:15,800 --> 10:30:16,500
Oh, we dragged now?

8021
10:30:16,640 --> 10:30:19,120
I have no one to drag down with me, unfortunately.

8022
10:30:21,420 --> 10:30:25,820
Unfortunately, there's no one here to drag down with us to the pits of hell.

8023
10:30:26,340 --> 10:30:27,540
Ha ha ha ha!

10:30:35,330 --> 10:30:36,910
Yeah, thanks for playing, Rocket.

8027
10:30:38,010 --> 10:30:40,030
It was a random invite.

8028
10:30:40,450 --> 10:30:41,130
I had fun.

8029
10:30:42,810 --> 10:30:44,850
Oh, I do like you make him shake.

8030
10:30:45,190 --> 10:30:45,570
You know what?

8031
10:30:45,590 --> 10:30:46,630
I need some bathroom, Manny.

8032
10:30:46,870 --> 10:30:46,870
Whoa.

8033
10:30:47,870 --> 10:30:48,530

8034
10:30:48,650 --> 10:30:49,490
I gotta use the bathroom.

8035
10:32:29,750 --> 10:32:30,630
I'm back.

8036
10:32:31,910 --> 10:32:33,050
Oh, these keys are getting longer.

8037
10:32:33,270 --> 10:32:33,850
I don't understand.

8038
10:32:34,490 --> 10:32:36,110
Aren't real people waking up now?

8039
10:32:40,590 --> 10:32:43,350
We're the real players that are waking up now.

8040
10:32:55,520 --> 10:33:01,200
I should have done this longer.

8041
10:33:02,420 --> 10:33:04,720
No, I should have done this earlier, not longer.

8042
10:33:05,280 --> 10:33:06,300
I should have done this earlier.

8043
10:33:07,760 --> 10:33:08,640
It's been fun.

8044
10:33:23,200 --> 10:33:24,720
It's just... I don't know.

8045
10:33:24,920 --> 10:33:27,040
I'm just enjoying, like...

8046
10:33:27,040 --> 10:33:28,980
I'm not griefing, but like...

8047
10:33:28,980 --> 10:33:30,040
It just brings me joy.

8048
10:33:31,200 --> 10:33:32,900
When... I swear, end of season?

8049
10:33:33,140 --> 10:33:34,980
Also, like, end of season?

8050
10:33:35,660 --> 10:33:37,320
People are like, so...

8051
10:33:37,320 --> 10:33:38,320
So toxic.

8052
10:33:38,600 --> 10:33:40,320
Wait, why can't I play on the beach ball?

8053
10:33:40,440 --> 10:33:41,560
This is discrimination.

8054
10:33:42,340 --> 10:33:43,380
Jeff should be... Oh, wait.

8055
10:33:43,560 --> 10:33:44,760
Jeff should be allowed.

8056
10:33:46,240 --> 10:33:46,720
Uh...

8057
10:33:46,740 --> 10:33:47,120

8058
10:33:48,220 --> 10:33:48,820

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

8066
10:34:34,540 --> 10:34:36,980
She's in the corner now!

8067
10:34:42,360 --> 10:34:44,980
She's in the corner!

8068
10:34:45,420 --> 10:34:48,360
And she's following an HR complete!

8069
10:34:52,880 --> 10:34:54,800
Sniff-buff, sniff-buff.

8070
10:35:00,140 --> 10:35:01,080
Whoa!

8071
10:35:02,200 --> 10:35:03,860
That's her little private show.

8072
10:35:03,920 --> 10:35:05,020
and I'm the dog.

8073
10:35:09,730 --> 10:35:14,330
I like how she was actively making sure I don't look.

8074
10:35:17,350 --> 10:35:22,290
I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

8075
10:35:23,730 --> 10:35:24,910

8076
10:35:25,510 --> 10:35:26,710
She fucking does.

8077
10:35:33,180 --> 10:35:35,300
Oh, look, God was real.

8078
10:35:35,600 --> 10:35:36,340
It's him again.

8079
10:35:38,320 --> 10:35:40,580
Who knows what I am?

8080
10:35:41,540 --> 10:35:43,760
I'm a Dragoon.

8081
10:35:45,960 --> 10:35:46,460
I don't know.

8082
10:35:55,700 --> 10:35:55,920
Yeah.

8083
10:36:16,760 --> 10:36:18,520
Sorry, I read to read.

8084
10:36:19,100 --> 10:36:22,500
I zoned out because I got a message about the sponsor today.

8085
10:36:22,600 --> 10:36:23,660
So I was like reading through it.

8086
10:36:23,740 --> 10:36:25,020
And I'm like, what?

8087
10:36:26,480 --> 10:36:29,380

Yeah.

8147
10:42:04,930 --> 10:42:05,130
Yeah.

8148
10:42:07,130 --> 10:42:08,410
Not yet.

8149
10:42:08,830 --> 10:42:09,030
Yeah.

8150
10:42:11,790 --> 10:42:13,230
This is bad.

8151
10:42:13,410 --> 10:42:13,410
This is bad.

8152
10:42:13,410 --> 10:42:14,610
We double support all of it.

8153
10:42:15,110 --> 10:42:15,110
Damn.

8154
10:42:15,470 --> 10:42:16,730
I thought me.

8155
10:42:17,870 --> 10:42:18,930
Me at.

8156
10:42:21,450 --> 10:42:25,410
You know, that, you know, because like you think that.

8157
10:42:26,410 --> 10:42:29,170
It's like I'm saying you wouldn't please let me die.

8158
10:42:29,870 --> 10:42:30,390
Just stop.

8159
10:42:30,790 --> 10:42:32,290
I just want to die.

8160
10:42:35,110 --> 10:42:49,170
Just let, you know, Just all The ultrano isn't gonna save me from It's not gonna save me from oh my gosh.

8161
10:42:49,770 --> 10:42:49,790
Okay.

8162
10:42:50,810 --> 10:42:54,250
Oh my gosh a spy mask and a fucking Spy

8163
10:42:59,190 --> 10:43:02,790
You know what time is it is what

8164
10:43:06,350 --> 10:43:08,630
Do you know what time it is

8165
10:43:14,290 --> 10:43:17,310
Oh, this is bad.

8166
10:43:21,110 --> 10:43:23,770
I can wait as far as I could.

8167
10:43:26,830 --> 10:43:28,310
This was as far as I could.

8168
10:43:29,830 --> 10:43:30,470
Oh, shit.

8169
10:43:31,350 --> 10:43:31,930
Look at him.

8170
10:43:32,310 --> 10:43:32,310
Go!

8171
10:43:34,610 --> 10:43:35,210
Okay, it's fine.

8172
10:43:35,610 --> 10:43:36,570
Smash is still alive.

8173
10:43:39,230 --> 10:43:39,690
It's okay.

8174
10:43:41,050 --> 10:43:41,730
The shark and the shark.

8175
10:43:41,750 --> 10:43:42,890
not coming back.

8176
10:43:44,930 --> 10:43:47,830
We have Riz right here in the middle of the point.

8177
10:43:48,990 --> 10:43:50,470
It'll still work, though, I swear.

8178
10:43:54,070 --> 10:43:54,630
Oh my god.

8179
10:43:54,790 --> 10:43:56,790
Oh my god, we're keeping you alive, Smash.

8180
10:43:57,230 --> 10:43:58,210
You go, Smash.

8181
10:43:58,710 --> 10:43:59,270
You go!

8182
10:44:00,450 --> 10:44:02,070
I'm training for you!

8183
10:44:04,890 --> 10:44:06,610
And that was all I'm going to use it.

8184
10:44:09,410 --> 10:44:15,710
Well, how about all that rocket smack talk for a few months ago, they made her meta, unfortunately.

8185
10:44:19,530 --> 10:44:21,210
Because they nerfed Loki.

8186
10:44:22,010 --> 10:44:24,250
So his res is too good now.

8187
10:44:26,410 --> 10:44:27,310
They nerfed Loki.

8188
10:44:28,710 --> 10:44:42,510
So people realize, wait, if it's endgame, you play Rocket, and then you play Rocket when it's overtime, so you can give an extra res, and then you can just hide in the back and just start healing.

8189
10:44:43,110 --> 10:44:44,150
That's literally it.

8190
10:44:45,690 --> 10:44:47,190
This guy playing Starlord lets guys up.

8191
10:44:47,290 --> 10:44:48,530
I'm going to stay on Rocket.

8192
10:44:49,350 --> 10:44:50,130
Fucking stupid.

8193
10:44:50,650 --> 10:44:51,990
I'm going to swap off later.

8194
10:44:52,810 --> 10:44:54,210
After I'm used to my up.

8195
10:44:59,250 --> 10:45:00,530
I still don't respect them.

8196
10:45:05,030 --> 10:45:08,270
Who said I still respect raccoon players?

8197
10:45:09,090 --> 10:45:19,610
I play raccoon when I have dude he's not gonna hook me i'm safe look at me i'm so safe

8198
10:45:23,700 --> 10:45:44,160
there you go oh he doesn't know there you go one five oh that's fine watch this he got res did you see that Yeah, res.

8199
10:45:46,840 --> 10:45:46,960
Oh!

8200
10:45:49,260 --> 10:45:50,280
There you go.

8201
10:45:51,460 --> 10:45:51,880
Hello.

8202
10:45:52,660 --> 10:45:53,160
Goodbye.

8203
10:45:54,440 --> 10:45:55,680
Game changer.

8204
10:45:56,020 --> 10:45:56,480
Exactly.

8205
10:45:58,220 --> 10:45:59,680
And then I can stay up here.

8206
10:46:00,040 --> 10:46:00,940
Did you see that?

8207
10:46:02,280 --> 10:46:03,200
Did you see that?

8208
10:46:04,900 --> 10:46:09,200
Look, this is why.

8209
10:46:10,420 --> 10:46:11,280
I don't know why.

8210
10:46:11,360 --> 10:46:14,800
And then they made him even, they're gonna make him even stronger next to him.

8211
10:46:14,820 --> 10:46:49,170
patch that's the that's the worst part oh oh shit we're all dead all right now and then okay i'll say rocket you don't have to play shark bro you ain't got rid of me yet or rocket i bro i went it was overtime i had all i won't say that What do you mean?

8212
10:46:49,290 --> 10:46:51,450
It was overtime and I wasn't gonna fucking ditch.

8213
10:46:51,570 --> 10:46:53,850
We got point because of it, though.

8214
10:46:54,750 --> 10:46:57,290
Okay, now I'm definitely not adding him.

8215
10:46:58,070 --> 10:46:59,810
Not like he's gonna accept it anyway.

8216
10:47:00,310 --> 10:47:03,850
But like, look, I'm not gonna add him now.

8217
10:47:10,050 --> 10:47:11,230
Why don't you follow that?

8218
10:47:19,420 --> 10:47:20,380
Yeah, now...

8219
10:47:20,380 --> 10:47:21,440
Now it's too late.

8220
10:47:21,840 --> 10:47:23,940
Oh, nice, I did it.

8221
10:47:26,600 --> 10:47:28,100
I don't even think he would have accepted.

8222
10:47:28,300 --> 10:47:29,880
He'd be like, well, fuck this bitch.

8223
10:47:30,120 --> 10:47:30,920
I'm said whore.

8224
10:47:31,220 --> 10:47:34,020
I'm so used to using that as an insult now.

8225
10:47:36,100 --> 10:47:37,020
There you go.

8226
10:47:38,660 --> 10:47:39,240
Bro, I...

8227
10:47:39,760 --> 10:47:40,780
Bro, you're a pro!

8228
10:47:42,800 --> 10:47:44,320
Bro, I'm disappointed.

8229
10:47:47,940 --> 10:47:52,710

8230
10:47:56,440 --> 10:48:12,340

8231
10:48:18,520 --> 10:48:20,040
He's a...

8232
10:48:20,040 --> 10:48:24,040
That was interesting.

8233
10:48:24,800 --> 10:48:25,520
Does he know?

8234
10:48:26,000 --> 10:48:28,140
I was like, bro, the Spider-Man is...

8235
10:48:29,540 --> 10:48:32,760
He is swing his goddamn web.

8236
10:48:34,680 --> 10:48:35,820
That's the whole point.

8237
10:48:36,000 --> 10:48:37,000
He's Spider-Man!

8238
10:48:41,160 --> 10:48:42,380
All right.

8239
10:48:48,340 --> 10:48:48,920
Mag?

8240
10:48:49,500 --> 10:48:49,500
Mag?

8241
10:48:50,300 --> 10:48:53,940
Okay, he like almost missed, but that's...

8242
10:48:55,520 --> 10:48:58,440
Oh, okay, I was gonna say it.

8243
10:48:58,520 --> 10:48:59,300
How did he miss?

8244
10:49:03,940 --> 10:49:04,360
Alright.

8245
10:49:06,400 --> 10:49:08,660
That's gonna be a bit worried at him missing that.

8246
10:49:09,060 --> 10:49:09,880
But that's okay.

8247
10:49:10,260 --> 10:49:11,920
He bubbled, so it makes sense.

8248
10:49:16,410 --> 10:49:18,210
Oh my god, he aren't...

8249
10:49:18,970 --> 10:49:21,130
I don't know if I live this at all.

8250
10:49:22,550 --> 10:49:24,210
No, he got Reese.

8251
10:49:24,290 --> 10:49:25,410
Oh, wait, he's dead.

8252
10:49:29,350 --> 10:49:30,510
It's okay.

8253
10:49:31,230 --> 10:49:32,410
We're coming over.

8254
10:49:34,050 --> 10:49:34,570
It's okay.

8255
10:49:36,290 --> 10:49:37,710
He's coming over.

8256
10:49:40,810 --> 10:49:43,050
We're coming over, too.

8257
10:49:44,210 --> 10:49:44,550
Yay!

8258
10:49:45,350 --> 10:49:46,490
Sand down.

8259
10:49:50,560 --> 10:49:51,860
Okay, nice.

8260
10:49:52,880 --> 10:49:53,240
Yay!

8261
10:49:55,040 --> 10:49:55,560
Goodbye.

8262
10:49:55,560 --> 10:49:56,960
Oh My god, not yay.

8263
10:49:57,420 --> 10:50:00,320
What I did not hear in fucking Jesus Christ.

8264
10:50:01,160 --> 10:50:06,740
Okay, I'm gonna say I did not hear Hear that all that scared a shit out of me.

8265
10:50:06,760 --> 10:50:08,060
I was not ready for it

8266
10:50:11,100 --> 10:50:26,740
Oh my god, it never stopped never fucking stops like it just keep oh my god It just keeps going it Just Is he no?

8267
10:50:28,680 --> 10:50:29,000
Okay.

8268
10:50:36,400 --> 10:50:37,180
It's fine.

8269
10:50:37,640 --> 10:50:38,200
I'm helping.

8270
10:50:45,870 --> 10:50:46,470
It's okay.

8271
10:50:46,790 --> 10:50:47,630
We're still okay.

8272
10:50:52,830 --> 10:50:53,730
It's okay.

8273
10:50:59,330 --> 10:51:00,830
She should die, right?

8274
10:51:03,330 --> 10:51:04,130
If...

8275
10:51:05,890 --> 10:51:06,690
Like...

8276
10:51:06,690 --> 10:51:09,390
Technically, she should die, right?

8277
10:51:10,490 --> 10:51:11,290
Like...

8278
10:51:14,310 --> 10:51:27,450
I'm just, I'm like, bro, I, I fucking damage boosted the Ultron ult and also the venom fucking pounding the invisible woman.

8279
10:51:28,230 --> 10:51:30,470
Like, I'm like, how is she alive?

8280
10:51:35,430 --> 10:51:39,270
Like, how much, how much HP does she have?

8281
10:51:44,320 --> 10:52:12,300
she's taking words she should not have been alive it was a full-on damage boost oh my god i'm scared i don't want to play in smash he literally he has the most he has the most damage as ultron because i'm scared he actually has the most ko's in the match Bro,

8282
10:52:15,040 --> 10:52:16,820
I don't want to play against Smash.

8283
10:52:17,140 --> 10:52:18,120
Actually, how much did he gain?

8284
10:52:18,180 --> 10:52:18,560
Oh, he does.

8285
10:52:18,660 --> 10:52:19,960
He must have it hidden, too.

8286
10:52:20,920 --> 10:52:22,420
That's usually what pro players do.

8287
10:52:22,700 --> 10:52:24,260
They hide their...

8288
10:52:24,260 --> 10:52:25,980
They hide their thing.

8289
10:52:26,480 --> 10:52:28,100
Oh, he does it.

8290
10:52:28,140 --> 10:52:28,640
Oh, he must...

8291
10:52:28,640 --> 10:52:29,360
Maybe he doesn't...

8292
10:52:29,360 --> 10:52:30,180
How much did he gain?

8293
10:52:30,600 --> 10:52:30,980
Plus 18.

8294
10:52:31,220 --> 10:52:31,660
Yay!

8295
10:52:32,580 --> 10:52:33,420
Plus 18.

8296
10:52:35,080 --> 10:52:36,140
I like that.

8297
10:52:38,100 --> 10:52:38,540
Wait.

8298
10:52:39,260 --> 10:52:40,600
We're just the same.

8299
10:52:40,880 --> 10:52:41,320
and I.

8300
10:52:41,380 --> 10:52:42,540
Wait, what about God was real?

8301
10:52:42,680 --> 10:52:43,500
Wait, what did they get?

8302
10:52:43,920 --> 10:52:44,840
Actually, I'm curious.

8303
10:52:46,640 --> 10:52:47,860
Plus 22.

8304
10:52:48,540 --> 10:52:50,000
Okay, he's a GM player.

8305
10:52:50,180 --> 10:52:51,320
Okay, that makes sense.

8306
10:52:52,380 --> 10:52:54,520
I was gonna say plus 22.

8307
10:52:56,180 --> 10:52:57,620
Oh, he's not secure.

8308
10:52:57,860 --> 10:52:59,080
He's not secure.

8309
10:53:03,540 --> 10:53:05,200
Oh, to be fair, he's been screaming.

8310
10:53:05,540 --> 10:53:08,260
I'm saying he's not top 500 secure.

8311
10:53:12,970 --> 10:53:14,710
I don't actually do Do I avoid the Spider-Man?

8312
10:53:14,910 --> 10:53:16,390
I don't even know if he did anything.

8313
10:53:17,610 --> 10:53:18,530
Nine final hits.

8314
10:53:18,930 --> 10:53:19,170
13.

8315
10:53:19,270 --> 10:53:19,870
I mean, 13.

8316
10:53:21,610 --> 10:53:22,710
Is he mostly?

8317
10:53:23,150 --> 10:53:24,010
Yeah, I'm avoiding him.

8318
10:53:29,970 --> 10:53:31,470
No, he was rude!

8319
10:53:32,290 --> 10:53:34,270
He was like, why are you on rocket?

8320
10:53:34,550 --> 10:53:35,310
Okay, he wasn't rude.

8321
10:53:35,370 --> 10:53:36,310
He was just commenting.

8322
10:53:36,570 --> 10:53:37,310
But that...

8323
10:53:38,050 --> 10:53:39,870
That made me sad.

8324
10:53:41,450 --> 10:53:43,170
I don't think he knows who I am, too.

8325
10:53:43,530 --> 10:53:49,290
I don't think he'd be like, who the fuck is this bitch out of me randomly?

8326
10:53:52,550 --> 10:53:54,810
I'm like, it was because like, it was over.

8327
10:53:55,210 --> 10:53:56,950
It was overtime.

8328
10:53:57,790 --> 10:54:00,610
And I went rocket for the rest.

8329
10:54:01,090 --> 10:54:02,430
And then I had alt.

8330
10:54:03,010 --> 10:54:06,190
And I wanted to use the alt before I swap.

8331
10:54:08,090 --> 10:54:09,110
And it's like that.

8332
10:54:11,610 --> 10:54:12,550
It's not.

8333
10:54:13,530 --> 10:54:17,530
like why was still on rock i'm like i just wanted to use my

8334
10:54:32,140 --> 10:54:52,260
arm he actually he's still doing it that's crazy bro how much of a grudge do you have to be muted like actually how big of a grudge is is it right now to fucking be muted

8335
10:54:56,550 --> 10:55:02,430
just don't be a toxic asshole in game and you won't I didn't have to be muted.

8336
10:55:05,290 --> 10:55:08,150
Just create, if you really want to talk, create another account.

8337
10:55:08,390 --> 10:55:10,070
Unless that is your main account.

8338
10:55:13,450 --> 10:55:14,630
Like, it's so easy.

8339
10:55:14,790 --> 10:55:18,510
If you're muted, just fucking play on an alt account.

8340
10:55:19,190 --> 10:55:21,090
At least you're not muted on an alt account.

8341
10:55:25,450 --> 10:55:26,870
It's just that easy.

8342
10:55:31,080 --> 10:55:32,520
Why are you so mad?

8343
10:55:32,520 --> 10:55:35,000
It's been, you did this to yourself, bro.

8344
10:55:35,360 --> 10:55:40,920
Like, like, actually, bro, you did this to yourself.

8345
10:55:41,080 --> 10:55:42,120
Why are you mad?

8346
10:55:47,000 --> 10:55:47,660
That's IP.

8347
10:55:47,720 --> 10:55:49,760
I don't think, I don't think Marvite Rivals has that.

8348
10:55:50,080 --> 10:55:58,020
I think you have to commit multiple, um, oh, is he the Jeff good boy?

8349
10:55:59,340 --> 10:56:00,140
Where is he?

8350
10:56:02,760 --> 10:56:04,600
I'm the Jeff good boy.

8351
10:56:09,650 --> 10:56:12,590
Yeah, I'm private your profile, and they'll accept you.

8352
10:56:12,970 --> 10:56:14,250
That's the only requirement.

8353
10:56:14,830 --> 10:56:16,410
Lunar, thank you for the 100 biddies.

8354
10:56:16,630 --> 10:56:17,430
Thank you, thank you.

8355
10:56:19,850 --> 10:56:21,530
I'm private now.

8356
10:56:23,850 --> 10:56:25,390
I want to see you.

8357
10:56:30,470 --> 10:56:32,230
I'm private yourself right now.

8358
10:56:38,800 --> 10:56:39,900
These are so long now.

8359
10:56:39,960 --> 10:56:42,380
I heard his playoffs today, so many people are, like, warming up for it.

8360
10:56:42,580 --> 10:56:43,940
Wait, ZQD ranked?

8361
10:56:50,140 --> 10:56:51,600
That's, oh, nice.

8362
10:56:52,120 --> 10:56:52,480
Another, wait.

8363
10:56:55,580 --> 10:57:00,580
No, what, wait, is Etzu the only person in top 500 right now in the entire team?

8364
10:57:01,480 --> 10:57:03,100
Oh, my God, wait, he is.

8365
10:57:03,380 --> 10:57:04,340
Oh, except for lying.

8366
10:57:04,640 --> 10:57:05,520
But, like, lying.

8367
10:57:05,860 --> 10:57:07,700
I heard, like, all he does is play rank.

8368
10:57:11,510 --> 10:57:15,750
But, he's, like, a hard rank grinder.

8369
10:57:16,210 --> 10:57:17,030
Another victim.

8370
10:57:17,230 --> 10:57:17,810
Another one.

8371
10:57:17,810 --> 10:57:19,450
bites the dust.

8372
10:57:41,290 --> 10:57:41,810
Yeah.

8373
10:57:45,250 --> 10:57:47,450
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

8374
10:57:49,410 --> 10:57:50,450
But, um...

8375
10:57:51,050 --> 10:57:54,390
Oh, wait, I actually want to look at Smash's...

8376
10:57:54,390 --> 10:57:56,250
Oh, my God, I've been playing Luna, like...

8377
10:57:57,050 --> 10:57:59,990
The whole fucking last couple of matches.

8378
10:58:01,230 --> 10:58:05,590
Luna isn't that bad, but it's just so Boring!

8379
10:58:09,910 --> 10:58:10,110
Ta-da!

8380
10:58:13,760 --> 10:58:15,280
Did I make it to Celestial 2?

8381
10:58:15,540 --> 10:58:16,040
No.

8382
10:58:17,880 --> 10:58:19,400
But no one else is.

8383
10:58:23,220 --> 10:58:24,960
I'm a bad Jeff after this.

8384
10:58:25,760 --> 10:58:26,080
Fuck.

8385
10:58:26,360 --> 10:58:26,820
Is this?

8386
10:58:27,560 --> 10:58:28,660
This is a Jeff map.

8387
10:58:33,880 --> 10:58:34,720
I'm a bad Jeff.

8388
10:58:37,740 --> 10:58:38,980
Yeah, I'm gonna make it.

8389
10:58:41,340 --> 10:58:42,620
Don't worry, chat.

8390
10:58:46,310 --> 10:58:47,070
I'm going to make it.

8391
10:58:47,110 --> 10:58:48,590
I don't know if I'll play much of next season.

8392
10:58:48,850 --> 10:59:00,830
Because I heard, like I said, next season, um, next season is going to be a lot harder for support players.

8393
10:59:01,130 --> 10:59:03,110
Because everything is going to go against them.

8394
10:59:11,260 --> 10:59:11,720
Alright.

8395
10:59:12,880 --> 10:59:13,620
Spider-Man.

8396
10:59:16,160 --> 10:59:17,580
A friendly neighbor with Spider-Man.

8397
10:59:21,020 --> 10:59:23,700
Guys, they said triple support, not triple DPS.

8398
10:59:26,060 --> 10:59:26,900
Don't say that.

8399
10:59:27,020 --> 10:59:28,060
Don't say it's reachable.

8400
10:59:28,220 --> 10:59:29,680
I'm not here to hope, guys.

8401
10:59:32,340 --> 10:59:33,580
Hoping is bad.

8402
10:59:41,460 --> 10:59:42,980
Alright, here we go.

8403
10:59:55,160 --> 10:59:55,520
Go.

8404
10:59:59,030 --> 11:00:01,460
I have no more hope in my life.

8405
11:00:02,200 --> 11:00:03,340
Okay, that sounds really depressing.

8406
11:00:03,800 --> 11:00:04,760
In Marvel Rivals.

8407
11:00:06,080 --> 11:00:06,740
Sorry.

8408
11:00:07,200 --> 11:00:07,440
Sorry.

8409
11:00:07,840 --> 11:00:10,120
I meant in Marvel Rivals.

8410
11:00:12,020 --> 11:00:17,740
I mean, that sounded super edgy.

8411
11:00:17,880 --> 11:00:19,440
I meant in Marvel Rivals.

8412
11:00:20,180 --> 11:00:20,780
End game.

8413
11:00:22,160 --> 11:00:23,480
God, this...

8414
11:00:23,480 --> 11:00:25,100

8417
11:01:27,450 --> 11:01:29,470
Oh, you weren't looking at...

8418
11:01:30,290 --> 11:01:33,030
There was no way I was gonna grab Snowflake for you earlier.

8419
11:01:36,550 --> 11:01:37,510
Alright, nice.

8420
11:01:38,030 --> 11:01:39,490
Oh my god, he's actually him.

8421
11:01:40,730 --> 11:01:40,950
What?

8422
11:01:45,900 --> 11:01:47,860
Oh my god, he's actually Spodman.

8423
11:01:50,960 --> 11:01:51,940
Alright, it's...

8424
11:01:51,940 --> 11:01:52,980
You're gonna...

8425
11:01:54,620 --> 11:01:56,140
You're gonna do that thing!

8426
11:01:56,440 --> 11:01:57,440
We're... uh...

8427
11:01:59,000 --> 11:02:03,720
Where it's just they have triple support, so this game is going to last forever.

8428
11:02:05,160 --> 11:02:05,780
Again.

8429
11:02:07,480 --> 11:02:14,460
What the fuck is wrong with you?

8430
11:02:14,980 --> 11:02:15,200
What?

8431
11:02:15,980 --> 11:02:18,020
Oh my god, it's the...

8432
11:02:18,020 --> 11:02:19,380
Oh my god, it's Spider-Man.

8433
11:02:19,540 --> 11:02:20,780
It's the Spider-Man.

8434
11:02:23,700 --> 11:02:25,480
Oh my god, it's him.

8435
11:02:26,480 --> 11:02:28,080

11:03:47,550 --> 11:03:48,630
Don't worry, Doug!

8448
11:03:49,690 --> 11:03:51,030
I heard Doug is...

8449
11:03:51,030 --> 11:03:51,990
Didn't Doug like a controller?

8450
11:03:52,190 --> 11:03:52,670
I don't know.

8451
11:03:56,510 --> 11:03:57,390
Oh, God.

8452
11:03:58,090 --> 11:03:59,070
Wait, where is Moonet?

8453
11:04:00,170 --> 11:04:01,070
Where is he?

8454
11:04:01,890 --> 11:04:03,610

Alright, we're pushing the cart.

8458
11:04:45,260 --> 11:04:46,880

8459
11:04:47,200 --> 11:04:48,240
Oh my god, he's okay.

11:04:52,520 --> 11:04:53,060
Doug is ready.

8463
11:04:53,340 --> 11:04:54,040
Go, Doug, go.

8464
11:04:55,340 --> 11:04:56,680
I know you'll want to do it again.

8465
11:04:56,940 --> 11:04:58,320
Oh my god, goodbye.

8466
11:05:02,620 --> 11:05:04,880
Okay, I'm trying my best right now.

8467
11:05:07,680 --> 11:05:08,440
Again!

8468
11:05:11,580 --> 11:05:12,240
Goodbye, Doug.

8469
11:05:15,220 --> 11:05:15,980
Goodbye,

8470
11:05:19,640 --> 11:05:19,680
Doug.

8471
11:05:23,990 --> 11:05:24,410
Hello again?

8472
11:05:25,130 --> 11:05:27,070
I love Pluto so much, dude.

8473
11:05:31,270 --> 11:05:33,390
There we go.

8474
11:05:33,750 --> 11:05:35,990
Oh, no.

8475
11:05:37,510 --> 11:05:39,310
Oh my god, thank god!

8476
11:05:39,850 --> 11:05:41,010
Why don't I ever do that?

8477
11:05:41,030 --> 11:05:43,030
get players like, why don't we're...

8478
11:05:44,110 --> 11:05:44,350
What?

8479
11:05:47,450 --> 11:05:49,950
Wait, where is...

8480
11:05:49,950 --> 11:05:50,730
Where's the other?

8481
11:05:50,950 --> 11:05:51,950
Oh, it's right there.

8482
11:05:52,690 --> 11:05:53,950
I had to look again.

8483
11:05:54,110 --> 11:05:54,970
I was like, where is it?

8484
11:05:56,210 --> 11:05:58,350
Oh, where's my Spider-Man, too?

8485
11:05:58,770 --> 11:05:59,430
There he is.

8486
11:06:00,250 --> 11:06:01,330
Did he get the snowflake?

8487
11:06:01,530 --> 11:06:01,890
I couldn't...

8488
11:06:01,890 --> 11:06:02,270
Yeah, he did.

8489
11:06:03,130 --> 11:06:03,910
This is bad.

8490
11:06:11,850 --> 11:06:12,970
I'm trying...

8491
11:06:12,970 --> 11:06:15,050
I'm trying my best to get you.

8492
11:06:16,630 --> 11:06:17,130
Damn!

8493
11:06:19,530 --> 11:06:20,330
Finally.

8494
11:06:21,890 --> 11:06:22,250
Finally.

8495
11:06:22,530 --> 11:06:23,470
I felt like...

8496
11:06:23,470 --> 11:06:30,510
I felt like I haven't had a mag that actually blocks alt in 20 years.

8497
11:06:31,270 --> 11:06:33,730
In 20 years, this felt like the first time.

8498
11:06:35,450 --> 11:06:37,870
Lunar, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

8499
11:06:37,990 --> 11:06:38,190
Thank you.

8500
11:06:38,510 --> 11:06:38,990
Thank you.

8501
11:06:39,590 --> 11:06:40,570
Thank you.

8502
11:06:40,710 --> 11:06:45,170
The only cure is more Marvel rivals.

8503
11:06:47,910 --> 11:06:49,290
That's the only cure.

8504
11:06:51,870 --> 11:06:52,910
Don't worry, I can make it.

8505
11:06:56,230 --> 11:06:57,290
I can make it.

8506
11:07:04,460 --> 11:07:05,520
That's the only cure.

8507
11:07:06,100 --> 11:07:07,320
Doctor, doctor.

8508
11:07:08,520 --> 11:07:09,040
Round two.

8509
11:07:11,040 --> 11:07:12,300
Me making a moth, please.

8510
11:07:13,060 --> 11:07:13,580
What?

8511
11:07:13,880 --> 11:07:14,380
Who's he?

8512
11:07:14,640 --> 11:07:15,760
Wait, is he talking to me?

8513
11:07:16,020 --> 11:07:17,220
Oh, dog.

8514
11:07:17,500 --> 11:07:19,120
Oh, he's talking to dog.

8515
11:07:19,640 --> 11:07:20,160
Dog.

8516
11:07:20,180 --> 11:07:24,480
I was like, what me?

8517
11:07:25,180 --> 11:07:27,100
It's like, oh no, Doug, it's Doki.

8518
11:07:27,380 --> 11:07:27,860
I don't know.

8519
11:07:27,960 --> 11:07:29,220
It sounded the same.

8520
11:07:33,200 --> 11:07:34,680
Talk to me earlier?

8521
11:07:36,180 --> 11:07:36,760
Yeah, Doug.

8522
11:07:37,040 --> 11:07:38,300
I'm letting you know.

8523
11:07:39,260 --> 11:07:40,600
Bro, is he okay?

8524
11:07:44,830 --> 11:07:45,710
Bro, is he okay?

8525
11:07:45,990 --> 11:07:46,970
Why is he stuttering?

8526
11:07:47,510 --> 11:07:48,730
Is he so nervous?

8527
11:07:49,050 --> 11:07:49,530
He's like...

8528
11:07:49,530 --> 11:07:52,790
If you made me a mod, you could get free Elo.

8529
11:07:54,170 --> 11:07:54,630
Good luck.

8530
11:07:57,990 --> 11:07:58,450
Jesus.

8531
11:08:04,770 --> 11:08:06,290
Guys, if I get...

8532
11:08:06,290 --> 11:08:08,150
Oh, he's dead.

8533
11:08:09,010 --> 11:08:09,470
Never mind.

8534
11:08:11,430 --> 11:08:12,450
Bro's so nervous.

8535
11:08:12,590 --> 11:08:13,650
No, he's nervous around.

8536
11:08:13,770 --> 11:08:15,250
Doug, Doug.

8537
11:08:15,630 --> 11:08:16,530
Doug, he's our man.

8538
11:08:16,770 --> 11:08:17,770
No one can do it.

8539
11:08:17,830 --> 11:08:18,930
I guess we fucking die.

8540
11:08:21,730 --> 11:08:22,650
All right.

8541
11:08:23,230 --> 11:08:23,670
That's fine.

8542
11:08:23,890 --> 11:08:24,090
It's fine.

8543
11:08:27,010 --> 11:08:27,890
Good luck.

8544
11:08:29,210 --> 11:08:30,230
I go down.

8545
11:08:31,570 --> 11:08:32,610
Good luck.

8546
11:08:36,070 --> 11:08:38,110
That's not how it's seen goes.

8547
11:08:41,650 --> 11:08:42,690
Spider-Man.

8548
11:08:44,030 --> 11:08:44,790
It's crazy.

8549
11:08:44,890 --> 11:08:47,910
They went two tanks and still it's not Bruce.

8550
11:08:48,110 --> 11:08:48,730
It's not Hulk.

8551
11:08:54,110 --> 11:08:56,690
Wait, at least the widow is like, whoa, that widow swapped?

8552
11:08:57,190 --> 11:08:58,290
That's crazy.

8553
11:08:58,950 --> 11:09:00,330
What word am I living in?

8554
11:09:01,090 --> 11:09:02,670
The widow actually swapping.

8555
11:09:04,890 --> 11:09:07,630
Guys, you would know if I didn't have a sponsor today, I would keep building rivals.

8556
11:09:07,770 --> 11:09:08,650
You're so right, chat.

8557
11:09:09,450 --> 11:09:11,150
I like to joke you none of us said that.

8558
11:09:13,150 --> 11:09:14,570
Chat, you're so right.

8559
11:09:18,130 --> 11:09:20,050
I'm talking to the chat in my head.

8560
11:09:25,630 --> 11:09:26,150
What?

8561
11:09:36,590 --> 11:09:37,710
You're so right, chat.

8562
11:09:38,210 --> 11:09:39,230
The voices, yeah.

8563
11:09:39,610 --> 11:09:41,170
The chat in my head, you know?

8564
11:09:42,270 --> 11:09:45,170
There's you guys in that chat, in the other chat.

8565
11:09:46,350 --> 11:09:48,210
There you go.

8566
11:09:49,090 --> 11:09:50,090
We did it.

8567
11:09:51,410 --> 11:09:57,310
Oh yeah, also I found out, don't stand on the cart when you're ulting, because, um, it's bugged.

8568
11:09:57,550 --> 11:09:58,970
The heals can get bugged out.

8569
11:09:59,610 --> 11:10:26,490
not fun i can't do anything um the chat like uh your heels can actually get people killed because it won't heal people so don't stand on the yeah the elevation so don't stand on the car if you're if you're using a support oh just sitting in their spawn i can't even die oh man poor spider-man he can't kill

8570
11:10:29,890 --> 11:10:33,410
Oh no, we're Spider-Man.

8571
11:10:34,590 --> 11:10:36,530
Not the Spider-Man.

8572
11:10:36,950 --> 11:10:39,030
He can't do the thing he wants the most.

8573
11:10:42,450 --> 11:10:43,130
That's sad.

8574
11:10:43,590 --> 11:10:44,030
Oh my!

8575
11:10:45,770 --> 11:10:47,530
Holy shit!

8576
11:10:47,970 --> 11:10:51,630
Bro, he used his own fucking thing against him.

8577
11:10:52,250 --> 11:10:53,570
That's so...

8578
11:10:55,090 --> 11:10:55,970
Damn.

8579
11:10:56,770 --> 11:10:57,850
That poor guy.

8580
11:11:00,370 --> 11:11:01,690
That poor guy.

8581
11:11:04,510 --> 11:11:07,110
That's actually what a crazy shit to do.

8582
11:11:07,810 --> 11:11:09,610
He used his own fucking ult.

8583
11:11:12,790 --> 11:11:15,290
Oh, that's unlucky.

8584
11:11:15,450 --> 11:11:16,450
I almost killed him too.

8585
11:11:17,630 --> 11:11:18,830
I almost killed him.

8586
11:11:21,290 --> 11:11:22,850
Wait, did our Spider-Man die?

8587
11:11:24,750 --> 11:11:25,870
Okay, he didn't.

8588
11:11:25,990 --> 11:11:28,370
I was gonna say that would be so awkward if I just left.

8589
11:11:28,590 --> 11:11:29,130
There he is.

8590
11:11:29,610 --> 11:11:30,970
There is the Spider-Man.

8591
11:11:33,190 --> 11:11:33,590
Hello.

8592
11:11:35,590 --> 11:11:37,330
He definitely has ult, though.

8593
11:11:37,650 --> 11:11:38,570
So he's coming over.

8594
11:11:38,710 --> 11:11:39,850
He's slowly coming over.

8595
11:11:40,270 --> 11:11:41,970
Let me just slowly back up, too.

8596
11:11:43,050 --> 11:11:43,330
Yeah!

8597
11:11:44,950 --> 11:11:45,550
Woo!

8598
11:11:47,450 --> 11:11:49,490
Yeah, I'm not wasting my ult for myself.

8599
11:11:50,470 --> 11:11:53,230
Because Spider-Man is so blood-firsty.

8600
11:11:53,750 --> 11:11:54,350
Yeah!

8601
11:11:55,470 --> 11:11:56,350
Good game, guys.

8602
11:11:56,810 --> 11:11:58,050
Celestial 2!

8603
11:11:58,670 --> 11:11:59,170
Celestial 2!

8604
11:12:01,430 --> 11:12:02,630
We're back.

8605
11:12:04,610 --> 11:12:07,850
I made so many people to rank out of Celestia too.

8606
11:12:09,790 --> 11:12:12,290
Another gate properly kept.

8607
11:12:14,270 --> 11:12:16,350
Oh my god, he's jailed for his crimes.

8608
11:12:16,550 --> 11:12:17,890
What did he do?

8609
11:12:18,890 --> 11:12:21,150
Other than murdering thousands of people.

8610
11:12:21,450 --> 11:12:21,790
What else?

8611
11:12:21,890 --> 11:12:22,930
What did he do?

8612
11:12:27,790 --> 11:12:29,150
It's so fun.

8613
11:12:30,510 --> 11:12:34,290

That's actually bullshit.

8616
11:13:39,090 --> 11:13:40,470
Oh yeah, I want to check a replay of something.

8617
11:13:40,630 --> 11:13:41,190
What was it?

8618
11:13:41,470 --> 11:13:42,730
I don't want to check the replay of again.

8619
11:13:46,490 --> 11:13:49,430
I said I wanted to check the replay of something, but I forgot what it was.

8620
11:13:53,410 --> 11:13:54,550
Oh, that's good boy.

8621
11:13:57,250 --> 11:13:57,970
Oh, Smash?

8622
11:13:58,250 --> 11:13:58,670
What do I want?

8623
11:13:58,810 --> 11:14:00,490
Oh, wait, he didn't do it.

8624
11:14:00,890 --> 11:14:01,250
Coward!

8625
11:14:02,050 --> 11:14:02,410
Coward!

8626
11:14:05,350 --> 11:14:08,130
No, I want to check a replay earlier, but I forgot what it was.

8627
11:14:08,150 --> 11:14:12,470

Oh no.

8630
11:14:47,030 --> 11:14:47,890
Oh no.

8631
11:14:49,050 --> 11:14:50,330
I didn't avoid the other.

8632
11:14:50,670 --> 11:14:53,450
It took away the avoid from the other guy.

8633
11:14:57,270 --> 11:15:00,190
Yeah, because I'm not letting him fucking throw my game.

8634
11:15:02,810 --> 11:15:03,750
There we go.

8635
11:15:04,210 --> 11:15:05,070
I found him.

8636
11:15:07,350 --> 11:15:07,870
It's okay.

8637
11:15:08,170 --> 11:15:09,070
I found him.

8638
11:15:14,550 --> 11:15:15,290
It's alright, guys.

8639
11:15:16,310 --> 11:15:17,350
Price is averted.

8640
11:15:22,420 --> 11:15:22,900
Uh...

8641
11:15:23,440 --> 11:15:25,380
Oh yeah, I wanted to check the...

8642
11:15:26,580 --> 11:15:27,820
The invisible woman.

8643
11:15:31,970 --> 11:15:32,290
What was it?

8644
11:15:32,310 --> 11:15:32,850
Was it here?

8645
11:15:39,640 --> 11:15:40,740
Oh yeah, it was.

8646
11:15:41,560 --> 11:15:42,040
Okay.

8647
11:15:43,460 --> 11:15:44,060
There we go.

8648
11:15:44,960 --> 11:15:45,860
I wanna know.

8649
11:15:47,020 --> 11:15:48,320
Wait, that's the cloak and dagger.

8650
11:15:48,800 --> 11:15:50,580
Sorry, they're both blonde women.

8651
11:15:51,460 --> 11:15:52,140
Look at this.

8652
11:15:52,600 --> 11:15:53,360
Look at this!

8653
11:15:53,620 --> 11:15:54,460

You're tearing me apart.

8657
11:16:37,310 --> 11:16:39,930
Sorry, I'm like I think I am tired now.

8658
11:16:43,530 --> 11:16:45,970
Evil is a rejection of life.

8659
11:16:46,630 --> 11:16:49,210
There's a possibility that I'm tired.

8660
11:16:50,650 --> 11:16:52,670
Just a possibility.

8661
11:16:55,830 --> 11:16:56,970
But the gatekeeping.

8662
11:16:58,530 --> 11:17:26,390

8834
11:33:41,710 --> 11:33:44,090
This is real firepower.

8835
11:33:44,570 --> 11:33:46,350
I have to keep track of this Angela.

8836
11:33:47,130 --> 11:33:49,810
Because he's just going to keep doing that stupid push shit.

8837
11:33:53,640 --> 11:33:54,300
Oh, my God.

8838
11:33:54,520 --> 11:33:55,300
I don't want to pull it.

8839
11:33:55,320 --> 11:33:55,700
I don't want to pull it.

8840
11:33:55,780 --> 11:33:56,300
I'm so sorry.

8841
11:33:56,800 --> 11:33:57,500
I'm so sorry.

8842
11:33:58,020 --> 11:33:58,440
Hey,

8843
11:34:03,660 --> 11:34:03,660
guys.

8844
11:34:06,720 --> 11:34:07,140
Whoa.

8845
11:34:08,080 --> 11:34:09,760
Yeah, it's not fun.

8846
11:34:17,170 --> 11:34:17,350
Yeah.

8847
11:34:20,390 --> 11:34:20,810
Oh?

8848
11:34:22,830 --> 11:34:23,250
I?

8849
11:34:24,350 --> 11:34:24,770
I?

8850
11:34:25,230 --> 11:34:25,650
I?

8851
11:34:27,570 --> 11:34:29,350
Did you get anyone?

8852
11:34:29,490 --> 11:34:30,450
Oh, he did.

8853
11:34:35,450 --> 11:34:38,250
Bro, there's like a fucking 2v2 right now.

8854
11:34:38,490 --> 11:34:39,410
There you go.

8855
11:34:42,050 --> 11:34:42,570
Goodbye.

8856
11:34:44,670 --> 11:34:45,210
Bro, he's coming.

8857
11:34:45,350 --> 11:34:46,330
He's going for another one.

8858
11:34:46,910 --> 11:34:47,610
I'm so scared.

8859
11:34:48,950 --> 11:34:49,990
Coming for another one.

8860
11:34:50,730 --> 11:34:52,190
Now you see me.

8861
11:34:55,310 --> 11:34:56,690
Bro, what's going on?

8862
11:34:57,270 --> 11:34:58,570
What's going on?

8863
11:34:58,810 --> 11:34:59,870
What's going on?

8864
11:34:59,970 --> 11:35:00,590
What's going on?

8865
11:35:00,610 --> 11:35:00,810
on.

8866
11:35:01,030 --> 11:35:01,830
I don't know.

8867
11:35:02,750 --> 11:35:04,390
I don't know what's going on.

8868
11:35:06,090 --> 11:35:08,670
Let I don't know what's going on anymore.

8869
11:35:14,810 --> 11:35:16,970
This is this is hell.

8870
11:35:19,090 --> 11:35:20,770
Guys, I think we're getting full health.

8871
11:35:25,730 --> 11:35:27,130
Guys, I spoke too soon.

8872
11:35:27,770 --> 11:35:30,090
We might actually be getting full health, guys.

8873
11:35:30,230 --> 11:35:31,190
I spoke too soon.

8874
11:35:33,130 --> 11:35:33,690
Okay.

8875
11:35:33,710 --> 11:35:35,770
Oh my god, it was possible.

8876
11:35:39,870 --> 11:35:40,350
Yeah!

8877
11:35:41,770 --> 11:35:42,250
Goodbye.

8878
11:35:50,120 --> 11:35:54,140
It's like, yeah, I'm watching like several what, you know what, fuck this, I'm invisible.

8879
11:35:55,580 --> 11:35:56,600
I'm gonna stay invisible.

8880
11:35:57,580 --> 11:35:58,020
Fuck this.

8881
11:35:59,640 --> 11:36:04,260
The moment I get out of invisible, it's all bad things happen.

8882
11:36:07,440 --> 11:36:09,080
Bad things happen.

8883
11:36:11,960 --> 11:36:13,900
I don't know if he'll be alive.

8884
11:36:17,480 --> 11:36:17,860
No.

8885
11:36:18,380 --> 11:36:18,920
Oh, no.

8886
11:36:20,000 --> 11:36:20,740
Oh, no.

8887
11:36:21,140 --> 11:36:22,320
He's coming for me.

8888
11:36:26,980 --> 11:36:28,460
Bro, fuck up!

8889
11:36:30,240 --> 11:36:35,420
Bro, what do you want from me?

8890
11:36:39,420 --> 11:36:40,260
Hide and seek.

8891
11:36:40,500 --> 11:37:11,460
zero two three no he was actually just hunting me down well mel no he was just a penny one trick that's become an angela one trick and um that's it that's his entire story shinobi think of a twitch prime thank you thank you bro wanted me fuck 23 really after the hell i'm okay i think we actually have to avoid someone should have just played rocket.

8892
11:37:11,740 --> 11:37:12,640
Fuck that shit.

8893
11:37:14,600 --> 11:37:17,960
This is like the hell I have to go through and then minus 23.

8894
11:37:18,800 --> 11:37:20,480
I don't even know the point.

8895
11:37:21,040 --> 11:37:22,340
I guess afraid women.

8896
11:37:23,720 --> 11:37:24,900
I'll do afraid women.

8897
11:37:26,560 --> 11:37:27,100
And...

8898
11:37:27,100 --> 11:37:28,630
I mean, they were all pretty...

8899
11:37:30,080 --> 11:37:31,200
Not great.

8900
11:37:31,920 --> 11:37:33,060
Not fun.

8901
11:37:33,480 --> 11:37:34,500
They were all...

8902
11:37:37,360 --> 11:37:37,900
Um...

8903
11:37:40,920 --> 11:37:42,220
We avoided him?

8904
11:37:42,440 --> 11:37:45,160
I don't know if he was a bad Jeff player.

8905
11:37:49,140 --> 11:37:51,500
You're trying to secure it too, I see.

8906
11:37:53,120 --> 11:37:54,880
Oh, he's always so close.

8907
11:37:55,580 --> 11:37:57,340
I don't know if he was a bad Jeff player.

8908
11:37:59,660 --> 11:38:01,200
Hey, his name is John.

8909
11:38:03,320 --> 11:38:04,520
His name's Jeff.

8910
11:38:07,980 --> 11:38:10,460
Yeah, I don't think he was a bad Jeff player, though.

8911
11:38:10,500 --> 11:38:11,200
That's the thing.

8912
11:38:11,280 --> 11:38:12,060
It was fine.

8913
11:38:14,160 --> 11:39:06,150
yeah yeah you're right i'm going to doing a good deed and helping him um avoid women so you can't be more afraid hey john oh i forgot to oh he was that bad was he oh we avoid him i just hate playing as jeff that's it playing as jeff is just not fun one may feel empathy for an enemy and still destroy them you're right wait i should now i'll avoid him i'm thinking about it i'll avoid him so maybe i can get a better jeff player on my team now that i think about it i can always get a better jeff player

8914
11:39:15,460 --> 11:39:21,660
no need oh cool thanks bro i don't have to waste my voice lot i really appreciate it

8915
11:39:25,820 --> 11:39:27,320
I don't have no void.

8916
11:39:27,400 --> 11:39:27,960
Okay, yeah.

8917
11:39:28,020 --> 11:39:28,860
I'm just good here.

8918
11:39:33,490 --> 11:39:35,090
I don't know what I did wrong.

8919
11:39:35,850 --> 11:39:37,310
It was a lost game.

8920
11:39:37,450 --> 11:39:39,390
I was just fucking running around.

8921
11:39:44,890 --> 11:39:46,950
What did I do wrong, though?

8922
11:39:48,330 --> 11:39:51,850
I'm just thinking, like, wait, what did I do wrong?

8923
11:39:52,010 --> 11:39:53,950
I mean, free of void slot, but still.

8924
11:39:56,650 --> 11:39:58,650
I felt like I was just...

8925
11:40:00,210 --> 11:40:02,330
Maybe he's also afraid of women.

8926
11:40:09,810 --> 11:40:16,530
I'm pretty sure, like, in that entire game, I wasn't part of the problem that we had.

8927
11:40:23,390 --> 11:40:24,950
But you do you, buddy.

8928
11:40:26,070 --> 11:40:27,630
You do you.

8929
11:40:34,950 --> 11:40:36,610
And he prefers...

8930
11:40:38,250 --> 11:40:40,890
It was basically spawn camping me the whole game.

8931
11:40:41,610 --> 11:41:14,510
wasn't really trying because half basically like 50 my team was already like throwing like then i knew it wasn't winnable so i was just like at that point i was autopilot because i was like the attack i could tell during the attack like things weren't yeah everyone was just doing their own 1v1 at that point i was just like okay let me just but i know defense wise that game i wasn't i was mostly i was trying

8932
11:41:19,810 --> 11:41:41,590
um but um but yeah free avoids that i like how you said ggs it actually says like ggs what an

8933
11:41:52,370 --> 11:41:54,170
eu experience there

8934
11:41:57,450 --> 11:42:01,430
i hate everything about that's what saying.

8935
11:42:01,750 --> 11:42:03,910
I'm like, what the fuck did I do?

8936
11:42:05,150 --> 11:42:07,370
What was what was it?

8937
11:42:07,690 --> 11:42:08,890
What did I do?

8938
11:42:17,340 --> 11:42:18,960
Oh my god, the entire area is broken.

8939
11:42:19,580 --> 11:42:20,480
Hello, buddy.

8940
11:42:23,160 --> 11:42:23,580
Hey.

8941
11:42:24,780 --> 11:42:25,220
Whoa.

8942
11:42:26,160 --> 11:42:26,760
Everything okay.

8943
11:42:26,860 --> 11:42:26,960
Oh.

8944
11:42:28,360 --> 11:42:29,460
Where did she go?

8945
11:42:30,800 --> 11:42:34,020
Where did she wait, I'm by myself.

8946
11:42:40,510 --> 11:42:59,670
You want to avoid him so he got offended what i didn't even say i wanted to avoid him i was like i think he did i was like i'll avoid him just so i can get better support i can get pro support there chair

8947
11:43:11,930 --> 11:43:19,230
see you know depending on how aggressive we play if we play like high damage output um I can play strange and we can TP jump them.

8948
11:43:20,730 --> 11:43:22,270
I think Packers got that.

8949
11:43:25,410 --> 11:43:26,290
Who's Packers?

8950
11:43:26,650 --> 11:43:27,090
Him?

8951
11:43:28,250 --> 11:43:31,570
I'm listening to Link in part and on Adderall.

8952
11:43:31,830 --> 11:43:33,070
I see what we do.

8953
11:43:34,070 --> 11:43:34,470
I see.

8954
11:43:34,730 --> 11:43:34,950
Whoa.

8955
11:43:35,610 --> 11:43:36,030
Oh my god.

8956
11:43:36,170 --> 11:43:36,970
He's on Adderall.

8957
11:43:37,510 --> 11:43:38,470
He's going to do it.

8958
11:43:38,570 --> 11:43:41,150
Do you want to get Ultron here or Jeff or Emma?

8959
11:43:41,270 --> 11:43:42,670
Get Jeff out of the way.

8960
11:43:42,850 --> 11:43:43,290
Ultron Jeff or Emma?

8961
11:43:43,570 --> 11:43:45,310
Get Jeff out of here.

8962
11:43:45,670 --> 11:43:46,770
I'm tired of that motherfucker, bro.

8963
11:43:48,470 --> 11:43:51,850
Oh, you better be fucking gaming, or I'm going to be very upset.

8964
11:43:51,910 --> 11:43:53,970
Triple support and take over your fucking...

8965
11:43:53,970 --> 11:43:56,530
You better... I'll be very upset.

8966
11:44:00,590 --> 11:44:01,650
Pick your hero.

8967
11:44:02,150 --> 11:44:02,750
Or villain.

8968
11:44:05,400 --> 11:44:06,580
Alright, here we go.

8969
11:44:16,770 --> 11:44:17,490
I'm ready.

8970
11:44:23,720 --> 11:44:24,840
Let's see...

8971
11:44:24,840 --> 11:44:27,640
Just gotta check something real quick.

8972
11:44:28,820 --> 11:44:29,640
I don't know.

8973
11:44:30,200 --> 11:44:31,420
Oh shit, he doesn't know.

8974
11:44:33,120 --> 11:44:35,200
I don't know if we'll win this.

8975
11:44:37,480 --> 11:44:39,780
They have two top 500 players on the enemy team.

8976
11:44:40,300 --> 11:44:41,840
Or like X top 500 player.

8977
11:44:42,320 --> 11:44:43,040
And I have...

8978
11:44:43,040 --> 11:44:45,140
I'm gonna go heavy damage, uh, Packers.

8979
11:44:45,480 --> 11:44:45,980
Do you play DPS?

8980
11:44:46,660 --> 11:44:48,300
I can Neymar or Mantis?

8981
11:44:49,760 --> 11:44:51,680
Oh, all right, never mind.

8982
11:44:51,780 --> 11:44:52,920
We're not gonna TP jump on, bro.

8983
11:44:53,740 --> 11:44:54,580
What are we doing?

8984
11:44:56,540 --> 11:44:57,620
Well, that's just...

8985
11:44:57,620 --> 11:44:58,460
We already have two tanks.

8986
11:44:58,600 --> 11:44:59,940
You can go another...

8987
11:44:59,940 --> 11:45:01,780
No, I was gonna go strange.

8988
11:45:02,080 --> 11:45:04,260
I was gonna go strange and we could TP jump him if he did damage.

8989
11:45:05,180 --> 11:45:06,100
Are we doing it?

8990
11:45:06,240 --> 11:45:06,980
What are we doing?

8991
11:45:08,300 --> 11:45:09,680
What are we doing?

8992
11:45:10,240 --> 11:45:10,540
Hello?

8993
11:45:11,280 --> 11:45:12,760
I'm confused.

8994
11:45:13,720 --> 11:45:14,720
No, no, no, no, no.

8995
11:45:15,000 --> 11:45:16,060
What are we doing?

8996
11:45:16,460 --> 11:45:17,780
We don't have damage for it.

8997
11:45:18,220 --> 11:45:19,360
I'm confused.

8998
11:45:22,500 --> 11:45:24,340
What are we doing, buddy?

8999
11:45:25,040 --> 11:45:26,240
I'm so confused.

9000
11:45:26,680 --> 11:45:26,800
I'm so confused.

9001
11:45:30,940 --> 11:45:31,600
Luna.

9002
11:45:32,040 --> 11:45:34,080
Alright, here we go.

9003
11:45:35,360 --> 11:45:36,460
Don't worry, guys.

9004
11:45:37,160 --> 11:45:38,420
I have mines.

9005
11:45:41,540 --> 11:45:42,420
Don't worry!

9006
11:45:43,900 --> 11:45:44,440
Moon Knight.

9007

11:46:03,220 --> 11:46:03,660
They're gonna walk.

9015
11:46:03,820 --> 11:46:04,040
They're gonna walk.

9016
11:46:04,280 --> 11:46:06,660
Guys, it's a 5v6, guys.

9017
11:46:07,640 --> 11:46:08,520
Hello, don't worry, hello.

9018
11:46:08,980 --> 11:46:10,780
Welcome back to the world.

9019
11:46:11,400 --> 11:46:13,240
Goodbye, everyone.

9020
11:46:13,460 --> 11:46:14,100
They don't know.

9021
11:46:14,940 --> 11:46:15,980
Goodbye, everyone.

9022
11:46:17,380 --> 11:46:18,780
Goodbye, everyone.

9023
11:46:19,500 --> 11:46:20,860
It was nice meeting you all.

9024
11:46:21,240 --> 11:46:21,940
They're gonna...

9025
11:46:22,580 --> 11:46:24,220
They still don't know.

9026
11:46:24,820 --> 11:46:26,620
They still don't know.

9027
11:46:27,440 --> 11:46:28,060
I got the bridge.

9028
11:46:29,940 --> 11:46:30,800
Oh, he came back!

9029
11:46:31,060 --> 11:46:32,100
He came back!

9030
11:46:32,280 --> 11:46:32,480
No!

9031
11:46:33,420 --> 11:46:34,540
Come on.

9032
11:46:37,320 --> 11:46:39,260
Oh my god, he came back.

9033
11:46:39,420 --> 11:46:39,880
I don't know.

9034
11:46:40,120 --> 11:46:41,200
Maybe it...

9035
11:46:41,200 --> 11:46:41,940
I don't know.

9036
11:46:42,820 --> 11:46:48,700
The thing is, the thing I'm worried about is that we struggled 5v6.

9037
11:46:49,120 --> 11:46:49,400
Oh, wait.

9038
11:46:54,680 --> 11:46:59,680
The thing is, we sort of struggled 5v6, so...

9039
11:46:59,940 --> 11:47:03,200
I'm not that happy.

9040
11:47:07,420 --> 11:47:09,220
Guess who's back.

9041
11:47:10,140 --> 11:47:10,700
Back again.

9042
11:47:12,040 --> 11:47:13,460
Guess who's back.

9043
11:47:13,880 --> 11:47:14,500
Guess who's back.

9044
11:47:14,960 --> 11:47:15,640
Guess who's back.

9045
11:47:19,880 --> 11:47:22,080
I mean, we did heal.

9046
11:47:22,600 --> 11:47:24,120

9047
11:47:25,140 --> 11:47:26,160

11:47:26,680 --> 11:47:26,920

9056
11:48:12,770 --> 11:48:13,710
He doesn't know.

9057

This is you Mantis.

9058
11:48:15,030 --> 11:48:15,650

They just don't die.

9127
11:51:05,670 --> 11:51:07,370
Oh, what do we do?

9128
11:51:07,970 --> 11:51:10,130

9133
11:51:35,010 --> 11:51:36,410
Why I wanted it?

9134
11:51:36,650 --> 11:51:38,130

I'm healing back for the venom now.

9138
11:51:53,730 --> 11:51:54,650
You're a shooter.

9139
11:51:54,690 --> 11:51:56,270
I said, do you play like...

9140
11:51:56,270 --> 11:51:58,650
For the things I said in the...

9141
11:51:58,650 --> 11:52:00,630
He didn't even say any...

9142
11:52:00,630 --> 11:52:01,470
Wait, what?

9143
11:52:01,630 --> 11:52:03,050
What did he say?

9144
11:52:03,690 --> 11:52:08,850
What did he say?

9145
11:52:09,170 --> 11:52:11,950
Did he think I'm the other afraid women guy?

9146
11:52:12,930 --> 11:52:14,470
What did I say?

9147
11:52:14,490 --> 11:52:14,710
Hey!

9148
11:52:15,390 --> 11:52:17,790
Oh, he was the one that said slurs?

9149
11:52:18,070 --> 11:52:18,650
Oh, okay.

9150
11:52:19,170 --> 11:52:20,090
Okay, never mind.

9151
11:52:21,550 --> 11:52:22,350
Never mind.

9152
11:52:23,070 --> 11:52:25,810
I didn't realize he was, I guess he doesn't want to get reported.

9153
11:52:26,050 --> 11:52:27,530
I think we just gotta, we just gotta target ours.

9154
11:52:28,730 --> 11:52:30,790
Is that why you avoided me?

9155
11:52:31,630 --> 11:52:34,410
Because he's like, I'm avoiding you because I said slurs.

9156
11:52:35,270 --> 11:52:37,750
Like, is that how it goes?

9157
11:52:39,530 --> 11:52:40,530
Go up on, dude.

9158
11:52:41,550 --> 11:52:41,950
Easy key.

9159
11:52:45,090 --> 11:52:46,490
Bro, how is he alive?

9160
11:52:50,430 --> 11:52:51,190
Bro, that's unlucky.

9161
11:52:51,390 --> 11:52:52,490
There's no way he'd lose that.

9162
11:52:59,750 --> 11:53:00,110
Okay.

9163
11:53:00,730 --> 11:53:02,010

9165
11:53:05,190 --> 11:53:06,050
There we go.

We're good.

9169
11:53:09,270 --> 11:53:10,150
I'll play with him.

9170
11:53:12,590 --> 11:53:14,470
Yeah, we already caught him on stream, so I was just...

9171
11:53:15,910 --> 11:53:19,490

9175
11:53:29,530 --> 11:53:31,490
Don't worry, I pocket you, girl.

9176
11:53:33,610 --> 11:53:37,810

Okay.

9179
11:53:42,290 --> 11:53:44,470
I was gonna go first in all of them.

9180
11:53:44,490 --> 11:53:45,530

11:53:50,230 --> 11:54:01,930

Can you play?

9187
11:54:25,810 --> 11:54:41,070
I'm just very disappointed in our Adam.

9188
11:54:41,410 --> 11:54:44,350
It really was very unfortunate.

9189
11:54:44,650 --> 11:54:46,790
It really was.

9190
11:54:49,150 --> 11:54:49,550
Yeah.

9191
11:54:53,910 --> 11:54:54,690
Venom's gonna be fine.

9192
11:54:54,930 --> 11:54:55,930
It'll be fine.

9193
11:54:58,710 --> 11:55:00,450
Oh my god, he was so low too.

9194
11:55:02,170 --> 11:55:02,190
Nice.

9196
11:55:05,030 --> 11:55:05,430
Oh.

9197
11:55:05,430 --> 11:55:06,470

9198
11:55:06,650 --> 11:55:07,090
You're blocked off.

9199
11:55:07,130 --> 11:55:07,510
You're blocked off.

9200
11:55:07,710 --> 11:55:07,730
Strange.

9201
11:55:07,850 --> 11:55:08,170
You're blocked off.

9202
11:55:08,410 --> 11:55:11,330
There you go.

9203
11:55:12,870 --> 11:55:13,850
Please, we gotta kill him.

9204
11:55:14,650 --> 11:55:16,630
All right, here we go for a bit.

9205
11:55:17,930 --> 11:55:19,090
I'll just play with my Hella.

9206
11:55:19,430 --> 11:55:20,630
That's really it.

9207
11:55:21,230 --> 11:55:22,030
That's the plan.

9208
11:55:22,150 --> 11:55:23,030
How are we doing that ult here?

9209
11:55:24,690 --> 11:55:25,730
Oh, we only have one out.

9210
11:55:26,470 --> 11:55:26,990
I know, I know.

9211
11:55:27,130 --> 11:55:28,010

Me.

9213
11:55:31,350 --> 11:55:32,730

Mantis, Luna, Invis.

9215
11:55:34,890 --> 11:55:35,250

11:59:52,790 --> 11:59:54,150
We know Moon Knight is out.

Not having a good day.

9326

We only have one front line tank.

9327
12:00:51,210 --> 12:00:53,570
We need a tank bag and actually pressure the back line.

9328
12:00:53,710 --> 12:00:55,490
That's why they're creating more space than us.

9329
12:00:56,210 --> 12:00:56,230
Yeah.

9330
12:00:56,450 --> 12:00:57,910

Be right here.

9335
12:01:01,470 --> 12:01:02,410

9346
12:01:17,930 --> 12:01:19,950

He's got the... oh my god, not the moon!

9352
12:01:39,770 --> 12:01:41,410
Oh, we have no sub portals.

9353
12:01:45,430 --> 12:01:47,910
I definitely got RNGed with two.

9354
12:01:47,930 --> 12:01:48,370
teammates.

9355
12:01:50,510 --> 12:01:50,970
That's okay.

9356
12:01:51,170 --> 12:01:52,830
I've gate kept another game.

9357
12:01:54,610 --> 12:01:56,070
How many moves does this man have?

9358
12:01:56,230 --> 12:01:57,250
Well, we have brute.

9359
12:01:57,370 --> 12:01:59,470
It's just like a misunderstanding of how to play the game.

9360
12:02:01,690 --> 12:02:04,390
How do you misunderstand how to play the game?

9361
12:02:04,470 --> 12:02:06,170
We're playing the same game.

9362
12:02:06,530 --> 12:02:09,230
I feel so bad for Ahela.

9363
12:02:10,050 --> 12:02:13,450
Ahela did so much for that game, too.

9364
12:02:15,510 --> 12:02:17,290
The keeper returns.

9365
12:02:17,790 --> 12:02:19,950
The It's so over.

9366
12:02:20,390 --> 12:02:22,850
I just, oh, they're at minus 24.

9367
12:02:23,070 --> 12:02:23,830
Why does it keep?

9368
12:02:24,170 --> 12:02:25,870
I swear, I'm in like purgatory.

9369
12:02:26,390 --> 12:02:27,870
I'm actually in purgatory.

9370
12:02:31,630 --> 12:02:32,890
Actually, I don't know.

9371
12:02:33,290 --> 12:02:35,010
I don't know who to avoid that game.

9372
12:02:36,090 --> 12:02:37,850
Bro, like 23, 24, 16, 17, 18.

9373
12:02:38,370 --> 12:02:40,410
Like, I'm stuck in hell.

9374
12:02:42,210 --> 12:02:42,830
Oh, Packers.

9375
12:02:42,890 --> 12:02:43,890
No, Packers for sure.

9376
12:02:44,010 --> 12:02:45,630
No, I remember now.

9377
12:02:45,670 --> 12:02:46,670
No, Packers for sure.

9378
12:02:47,990 --> 12:02:49,390
For sure, Packers.

9379
12:02:49,510 --> 12:02:50,230
No, I don't know.

9380
12:02:50,570 --> 12:02:54,510
Yeah, no, I've seen some very questionable things from Packers.

9381
12:02:55,890 --> 12:02:56,790
Welcome back.

9382
12:02:57,450 --> 12:02:58,250
Welcome back.

9383
12:02:58,550 --> 12:03:01,270
Bro, there must be something wrong with this, man.

9384
12:03:02,250 --> 12:03:04,870
It's been five hours, I think.

9385
12:03:05,410 --> 12:03:05,930
Has it?

9386
12:03:06,030 --> 12:03:10,750
No, it's been three hours, and he's constantly sending me friend requests.

9387
12:03:11,210 --> 12:03:13,550
There is absolutely something wrong with him.

9388
12:03:13,670 --> 12:03:14,330
Like, I'm sorry.

9389
12:03:14,410 --> 12:03:16,570
Like, I usually don't say this, but mentally-wise,

9390
12:03:19,690 --> 12:03:42,530
like the fact that he checks back he spams ads me every time no it's just so interesting i'm not blocking him because he's so persistent and it's so interesting he really wants to yell at me like i can't help my guy like actually

9391
12:03:46,920 --> 12:03:59,000
he was in my no he's just a weirdo he apparently hates women too that's the thing he also really hates women no

9392
12:04:02,860 --> 12:04:19,720
he added out for like i didn't even say anything and i think he thought i was the other women that talked like talked back at him because i didn't say anything and then he like um and then he kept going on and on and then like in another apparently he just hates support players too.

9393
12:04:19,940 --> 12:04:22,680
He really fucking hates support players and women.

9394
12:04:23,700 --> 12:04:25,060
It's like, it's so weird.

9395
12:04:25,400 --> 12:04:27,020
And then my chat was just roasting it now.

9396
12:04:27,180 --> 12:04:32,340
And then, like, I told the devs about it because he was being such a fucking weirdo on my stream.

9397
12:04:32,840 --> 12:04:34,720
And I told the devs about it.

9398
12:04:35,060 --> 12:04:37,300
And then they muted him afterwards.

9399
12:04:38,180 --> 12:04:41,500
Because I'm pretty sure he has said some really fucked up shit to other people.

9400
12:04:46,750 --> 12:04:48,510
No, it's that guy that's being weird yesterday.

9401
12:04:48,850 --> 12:05:17,330
He's been spam adding me on rivals the entire like the last three to four hours he's been non-stop adding me trying to add trying to friend request me yeah there he goes again look there he goes like bros actually seek out bro like there he goes again look see every time i ignore it he comes back he checks too

9402
12:05:28,670 --> 12:05:33,250
No, there is a block feature, but it's just, it's so interesting to me.

9403
12:05:33,670 --> 12:05:34,570
It's so interesting.

9404
12:05:34,670 --> 12:05:37,170
I want to know, because he's hate watching me right now.

9405
12:05:37,890 --> 12:05:39,750
And that's, that doesn't matter to me.

9406
12:05:39,890 --> 12:05:40,910
That's just ad revenue.

9407
12:05:41,550 --> 12:05:47,330
Like, like, that doesn't matter to me.

9408
12:05:48,890 --> 12:05:51,410
Like every, I know he's hate watching me too.

9409
12:05:53,510 --> 12:05:55,690
I'm literally living red free in his head.

9410
12:06:00,560 --> 12:06:01,520
Oh, wait.

9411
12:06:02,060 --> 12:06:08,500
That means I can run 30 seconds of ads right now if I think about it.

9412
12:06:08,560 --> 12:06:09,120
What?

9413
12:06:12,400 --> 12:06:14,660
I give money to one you're angry at.

9414
12:06:15,000 --> 12:06:15,800
That'll show her.

9415
12:06:18,420 --> 12:06:19,680
No, he's like a...

9416
12:06:19,680 --> 12:06:20,920
He's either a...

9417
12:06:20,920 --> 12:06:25,480
Okay, he's either a grown adult or a teenager.

9418
12:06:26,060 --> 12:06:26,880
That's the thing.

9419
12:06:27,220 --> 12:06:29,540
Or, like, because he has hit puberty.

9420
12:06:32,440 --> 12:06:43,300
I don't think he'll ever like I don't think he'll ever like out unless that a woman like actually fucking hates herself there's no I don't think he's ever gonna get some

9421
12:06:47,520 --> 12:06:53,080
Cherry and Sabine um and Toki thank you for the Twitch Prime thank you thank you

9422
12:06:58,570 --> 12:07:07,850
I don't know if he has a job or like is going to school, because he's been playing Rivals, like, fucking weird-ass hours.

9423
12:07:20,400 --> 12:07:22,460
His job is a professional hate watcher.

9424
12:07:22,560 --> 12:07:23,440
That's fine with me.

9425
12:07:25,220 --> 12:07:26,000
I know I'm his gifter.

9426
12:07:26,120 --> 12:07:27,220

And you know what's...

9432
12:07:42,780 --> 12:07:44,800
I just find it super interesting.

9433
12:07:45,880 --> 12:07:46,800
Pick your hero.

9434
12:07:47,280 --> 12:07:48,540
It's a nice case studies.

9435
12:07:53,850 --> 12:08:26,070
ladies no matter how low your self-esteem is you can do better than honestly you can definitely do a lot better no it started like uh it literally started like today like i've never seen this man before in my life and then he had he's like super fixated on me because i was the one that guess it makes him so angry it makes him really angry

9436
12:08:39,580 --> 12:08:48,580
uh this is a weird-ass combo whatever no i literally like reach out to a devil about him it was uh

9437
12:08:53,990 --> 12:09:21,870
your battle starts in five four three two one all you need to do is to the mission area got it oh we're going left side okay i hear him jumping i actually don't want to go left side it sounds scary left side scares me oh no i'm scared already i'm so scared

9438
12:09:25,430 --> 12:09:34,930
i'm so scared you know why i'm so even more scared we do not have a lot of heels if you think about it.

9439
12:09:36,890 --> 12:09:38,210
Oh, that's five.

9440
12:09:40,570 --> 12:09:42,210
That makes me more scared.

9441
12:09:43,430 --> 12:09:45,270
Our heals are not that strong.

9442
12:09:46,870 --> 12:09:48,950
We're literally running Adam Luna.

9443
12:09:49,590 --> 12:09:52,070
This is not the best of times.

9444
12:09:52,870 --> 12:09:53,730
Yeah, 12 hours.

9445
12:09:53,990 --> 12:09:56,010
And I streamed 10 hours last night.

9446
12:09:57,030 --> 12:09:57,890
Can't help it.

9447
12:09:57,970 --> 12:09:59,450
I just...

9448
12:09:59,450 --> 12:10:01,030
So I didn't have a sponsor stream.

9449
12:10:01,090 --> 12:10:02,810
You guys would know I would just keep playing, too.

9450
12:10:02,850 --> 12:10:03,610
That's the worst part.

9451
12:10:07,750 --> 12:10:14,870
If I literally didn't have sponsor, I would I would have kept going Okay, fuck this I'm farming off of you

9452
12:10:19,070 --> 12:10:21,930
Why did you put him closer to me?

9453
12:10:27,360 --> 12:10:30,820
Are Meg pushed him closer to me?

9454
12:10:31,080 --> 12:10:32,140
Are you serious?

9455
12:10:32,860 --> 12:10:35,040
Are you actually serious?

9456
12:10:39,340 --> 12:10:52,170

9458
12:11:21,210 --> 12:11:23,090
Oh, okay.

12:11:26,150 --> 12:11:29,350
Oh, it wasn't unleashed.

Oh, my God.

9461
12:11:38,450 --> 12:11:39,410

9463
12:11:45,000 --> 12:11:46,200

12:11:52,680 --> 12:11:54,600
Okay, I'm coming back.

9468
12:11:54,860 --> 12:11:56,980
We only have Adam heels.

9469
12:11:57,280 --> 12:11:58,260
Oh, I forgot my seed.

9470
12:11:58,660 --> 12:11:59,840
Oh my god.

9471
12:12:00,040 --> 12:12:00,220
I'm running.

9472
12:12:00,400 --> 12:12:00,740
I'm skating.

9473
12:12:00,900 --> 12:12:01,520
I'm skating fast.

9474
12:12:01,920 --> 12:12:02,740
I'm skating fast.

9475
12:12:02,980 --> 12:12:03,900
I'm skating fast.

9476
12:12:04,640 --> 12:12:06,980
I need to stop being greedy when that happens though.

9477
12:12:07,140 --> 12:12:08,420
Sometimes I just get so greedy.

9478
12:12:08,860 --> 12:12:10,940
Because I'm like, oh, I can kill him myself.

9479
12:12:11,220 --> 12:12:12,500
But like, obviously I can't.

9480
12:12:12,580 --> 12:12:13,500
I'm just a little guy.

9481
12:12:14,300 --> 12:12:16,200
I'm just such a little guy.

9482
12:12:25,210 --> 12:13:16,150
just let him tap that okay okay I'm a little scared oh my god oh my god oh my God oh my god please what is going on I'm I'm trying to focus right now what is going on Jesus Christ I'm swimming I'm swimming!

9483
12:13:17,530 --> 12:13:18,150
I leave!

9484
12:13:23,750 --> 12:13:24,190
Okay.

9485
12:13:25,130 --> 12:13:25,750
That's fine.

9486
12:13:29,130 --> 12:13:29,930
Oh, they see nine!

9487
12:13:30,230 --> 12:13:30,830
They see nine!

9488
12:13:31,170 --> 12:13:31,610
Thank God!

9489
12:13:33,310 --> 12:13:34,610
Thank God they see nine!

9490
12:13:36,430 --> 12:13:37,790
That was crazy.

9491
12:13:37,970 --> 12:13:40,430
I was like, I think things are okay?

9492
12:13:43,270 --> 12:13:47,670
I think everything, so many things are happening.

9493
12:13:48,170 --> 12:13:50,390
Okay, I think we're okay.

9494
12:13:51,010 --> 12:13:52,590
I think we're okay, guys.

9495
12:13:53,010 --> 12:14:00,350
I A lot of stuff are happening, but I think we're gonna make it.

9496
12:14:05,390 --> 12:14:10,330
Okay, yeah, yippee yippee yippee yippee yippee yippee yippee

9497
12:14:14,330 --> 12:14:24,290
Now when I play too long I get so locked in I think it is also a lot I mean, like, playing support is that I don't stream my wrist a lot, or, like, my arm.

9498
12:14:24,730 --> 12:14:25,490
I arm aim.

9499
12:14:25,690 --> 12:14:27,830
I don't use wrist aim, but my...

9500
12:14:29,130 --> 12:14:29,610
Um...

9501
12:14:29,610 --> 12:14:39,890
That's why I can play long hours, because, like, support is so, like, much more, like, less aim-intensive than DPS in general.

9502
12:14:42,210 --> 12:14:45,710
So, yeah, I don't have to, like, worry too much.

9503
12:14:47,830 --> 12:14:51,950
Obviously, I still have to, like, you know, Make sure I don't fuck it up.

9504
12:14:54,970 --> 12:14:55,750
But it's not.

9505
12:14:59,370 --> 12:15:00,590
Oh my god.

9506
12:15:00,790 --> 12:15:01,950
Oh, I should have used C.

9507
12:15:02,370 --> 12:15:03,630
I should have used my C.

9508
12:15:03,990 --> 12:15:07,770
I just didn't think I was going to take that much damage.

9509
12:15:10,310 --> 12:15:11,810
Oh, they're not in Hulk anymore.

9510
12:15:18,760 --> 12:15:19,660
That's unlucky.

9511
12:15:24,810 --> 12:15:25,330
Where's the...

9512
12:15:25,350 --> 12:15:28,590

I think I damage boosted him?

9519
12:16:17,940 --> 12:16:18,760

12:16:19,620 --> 12:16:21,080

9521
12:16:21,380 --> 12:16:21,800

There was no way we could save them, man.

9533
12:17:10,720 --> 12:17:11,980
You do not deserve that.

9534
12:17:12,220 --> 12:17:14,020
You do not deserve the Snowflake.

9535
12:17:14,180 --> 12:17:15,780
I saw your stats, buddy.

9536
12:17:18,660 --> 12:17:20,120

9542
12:17:37,780 --> 12:17:38,360
That's the thing.

9543
12:17:39,160 --> 12:17:40,680
I have to save my clap.

9544
12:17:43,600 --> 12:17:44,400
Can he walk the point?

9545
12:17:47,320 --> 12:17:49,380

9546
12:17:49,380 --> 12:17:50,760
I'm trying my best.

9547
12:17:53,700 --> 12:17:56,840
I'm trying my best to walk the point right now.

9548
12:17:57,380 --> 12:17:57,860
I'm frozen.

9549
12:17:58,180 --> 12:17:58,420

9559
12:19:28,260 --> 12:19:32,640

Oh my god, he's so low too.

9564
12:19:54,980 --> 12:19:56,240
I think that's the worst part.

9565
12:20:01,400 --> 12:20:01,960
No, no, no.

9566
12:20:03,200 --> 12:20:03,520

All right.

9573
12:20:20,880 --> 12:20:22,580
Things will be all right.

9574
12:20:26,010 --> 12:20:26,970
Jesus Christ.

9575
12:20:27,370 --> 12:20:28,350
Jesus Christ.

9584
12:20:56,530 --> 12:21:02,090

9585
12:21:07,800 --> 12:21:11,400

Oh my god.

9589
12:22:01,530 --> 12:22:03,690

I had to crash out there.

9592
12:22:10,110 --> 12:22:11,430
I really did.

9593
12:22:15,450 --> 12:22:19,970
It was 100% 100% worth crashing up.

9594
12:22:19,990 --> 12:22:20,510
Can I get flaked?

9595
12:22:20,690 --> 12:22:21,470

I don't think I can live anymore.

Not the best.

9612
12:23:52,200 --> 12:23:53,260
Oh, this is bad.

9613
12:23:53,400 --> 12:23:53,940
This is bad.

9614
12:23:53,960 --> 12:24:02,960
This is very bad because we used our cloca, which was our ace cart.

9615
12:24:08,670 --> 12:24:10,910

9639
12:25:32,100 --> 12:25:36,580
I feel like I haven't seen such a high number in so long.

9640
12:25:39,500 --> 12:25:41,300
It truly was a special day.

9641
12:25:43,000 --> 12:25:43,720
Oh, you stopped.

This guy is a pro player.

9645
12:25:48,820 --> 12:25:50,380
The other one's a weirdo.

9646
12:25:52,680 --> 12:25:54,120

That's why I should say not take coffee or energy drink.

9654
12:27:53,630 --> 12:27:54,510
This is my energy.

9655
12:27:54,990 --> 12:27:58,750

9660
12:29:16,780 --> 12:29:17,580

12:29:21,280 --> 12:29:25,880
Okay, this is, look, 738.

12:29:30,800 --> 12:29:31,300
348.

9665
12:29:31,360 --> 12:29:32,360
I came back.

9666
12:29:32,880 --> 12:29:33,340
116.

9667
12:29:33,960 --> 12:29:34,280
77.

9668
12:29:35,200 --> 12:29:36,960
It gets lower and lower.

9669
12:29:38,100 --> 12:29:39,960
Well, not lower and lower, but it goes up and down.

9670
12:29:40,060 --> 12:29:40,620
It went lower.

9671
12:29:45,510 --> 12:29:46,010
Which

9672
12:29:49,390 --> 12:29:50,330

Just be aware that in the back line.

9677
12:30:58,400 --> 12:31:00,320
Wait, we're not binding Iron Fist?

9678
12:31:01,800 --> 12:31:04,460
I guess because you wouldn't have damage boost.

9679
12:31:04,920 --> 12:31:05,280
But really?

9680
12:31:05,300 --> 12:31:07,340
You and heroes could make all the difference.

9681
12:31:09,300 --> 12:31:10,040
I'm Luna Snow.

9682
12:31:10,760 --> 12:31:13,160
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

9683
12:31:14,800 --> 12:31:14,980
Alright.

9684
12:31:15,500 --> 12:31:18,120
No matter what happens, this is LG.

Oh, we will see about that then.

9687
12:31:52,340 --> 12:31:55,900
This has to be LG, because Ash has to go downstairs and drop him off.

9688
12:31:56,460 --> 12:31:57,860
So I have to stop.

9689
12:31:59,480 --> 12:31:59,980
Unwillingly.

9690
12:32:01,680 --> 12:32:04,540
Not because I want to stop.

9691
12:32:04,700 --> 12:32:05,200
Hey, bro.

9692
12:32:05,480 --> 12:32:06,560

I like Rocky, bro.

9695
12:32:10,080 --> 12:32:10,720
Don't mind it.

9696
12:32:12,900 --> 12:32:14,460
But Dad comes first.

9697
12:32:15,040 --> 12:32:18,060
Four, three, two, one.

9698
12:32:20,830 --> 12:32:25,670
No, because I have to prepare his, uh, are you running triple support?

9699
12:32:25,870 --> 12:32:27,590

We got three though, but it's fine, right?

9712

Don't worry, I'm coming back, guys.

9719
12:33:29,710 --> 12:33:30,550

9726
12:33:47,090 --> 12:33:47,930
Not fair.

9727
12:33:48,030 --> 12:33:49,590
They have real players.

9728
12:33:50,190 --> 12:33:55,630

9729
12:33:59,650 --> 12:34:02,050

Okay, that's good.

9732
12:34:09,030 --> 12:34:10,470
Oh, that's unfortunate.

9733
12:34:10,790 --> 12:34:11,990
That's actually unfortunate.

9734
12:34:19,050 --> 12:34:21,610
The reload, so let's hope he doesn't die!

9735
12:34:23,330 --> 12:34:25,310

Nobody blocked it.

9743
12:35:16,820 --> 12:35:18,960
Nobody blocked it in the end.

9744
12:35:20,580 --> 12:35:21,180
That's unlucky.

9745
12:35:21,500 --> 12:35:22,380
That's not fair.

9746
12:35:22,700 --> 12:35:24,020
They got real people.

9747
12:35:29,190 --> 12:35:32,490
As Logan falls that hard, that he's not secure.

9748
12:35:32,870 --> 12:35:33,710
That's crazy.

9749
12:35:35,310 --> 12:35:36,850
That's all right, Logan.

9750
12:35:37,870 --> 12:35:39,790
Sometimes it do be like that.

9751
12:35:43,590 --> 12:35:45,930
Sometimes life is like that.

9752
12:35:51,440 --> 12:35:52,480
No, we just don't have...

9753
12:35:52,480 --> 12:35:53,470

They went low-key, too.

9826
12:42:13,150 --> 12:42:14,230
They went full-style.

9827
12:42:15,070 --> 12:42:16,530

12:42:16,630 --> 12:42:19,130

12:46:51,190 --> 12:46:52,290
He's not secure yet.

9867
12:46:52,610 --> 12:46:55,170
He can't I think necrust give up.

9868
12:46:55,290 --> 12:46:58,690
I think that was yay I succeeded

9869
12:47:02,930 --> 12:47:05,150
Gate successfully kept

9870
12:47:11,110 --> 12:47:11,710
Yay!

9871
12:47:14,090 --> 12:47:14,690
Successfully.

9872
12:47:14,930 --> 12:47:15,950
That was the game.

9873
12:47:16,110 --> 12:47:17,450
That was the last straw.

9874
12:47:17,710 --> 12:47:18,870
I've done my job.

9875
12:47:19,670 --> 12:47:22,430
My O-sheet did it.

9876
12:47:23,370 --> 12:47:23,690
Yay!

9877
12:47:24,550 --> 12:47:26,810
Now I can rest happily.

9878
12:47:28,050 --> 12:47:30,950
Another play is stream destroyed.

9879
12:47:33,070 --> 12:47:36,550
All I'm saying is that this is what gives me...

9880
12:47:36,550 --> 12:47:38,150
I think this is why I can extremely long hours.

9881
12:47:38,290 --> 12:47:46,390
I think with this new mindset, like it makes me happy, like it makes me like less sad playing rivalries, knowing that I'm ruining other people's chances.

9882
12:47:47,170 --> 12:47:54,150
Like, uh, the, you know, terrorism arc is over for now.

9883
12:47:57,030 --> 12:47:58,670
I am just running on spite.

9884
12:47:58,910 --> 12:48:01,250
Hey guys, I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

9885
12:48:01,350 --> 12:48:02,090
Like I said, I'll be on vacation.

9886
12:48:02,250 --> 12:48:02,710
Not vacation.

9887
12:48:02,870 --> 12:48:03,550
Sorry, business trip.

9888
12:48:03,830 --> 12:48:05,690
I'm gonna treat it like a semi-vacation.

9889
12:48:06,270 --> 12:48:32,910

Survive.

9893
12:48:42,050 --> 12:48:44,990
Um, anyway, guys, for those who don't know me, my name is Doki Bird.

9894
12:48:45,430 --> 12:48:47,630
And I usually stream on YouTube, but today I'm here.

9895
12:48:48,070 --> 12:48:49,610
Uh, because, like I said, I was doing guerrilla.

9896
12:48:49,630 --> 12:48:53,430
I like to do guerrilla stuff on here, like, like non-schedule streams here.

9897
12:48:53,870 --> 12:48:56,330
And my degenerate rank grinds.

9898
12:48:56,370 --> 12:48:57,230

9899
12:48:57,430 --> 12:48:58,610

I had a lot of fun playing.

9903
12:49:04,190 --> 12:49:09,810
It really does mean a lot to have you guys that hang out with me today during the climb.

9904
12:49:10,150 --> 12:49:15,870
It really makes rent climbing a lot more easier.

9905
12:49:16,930 --> 12:49:22,130
Also, like, if that guy that played me in another language,

9906
12:49:25,810 --> 12:49:30,310
if he, like, did that and I was off stream, I would have cried.

9907
12:49:30,330 --> 12:49:33,110
I would have actually cried

9908
