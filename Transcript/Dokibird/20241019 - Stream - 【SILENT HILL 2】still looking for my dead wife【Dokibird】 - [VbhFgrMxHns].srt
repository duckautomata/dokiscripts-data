00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,840
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,960
Sorry I'm late guys.

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,060
Sorry, I got stuck in a Mario Party collab.

4
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,220
It got started late.

5
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,080
It got started late because they were trying to find one last person.

6
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,020
So I was just zoning out.

7
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,880
And then, I swear, it said two turns.

8
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,980
But that two turns had to be the longest fucking two turns of my life.

9
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,120
Like, everybody was thinking.

10
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,160
And so I was like, what is there to think?

11
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,260
There's only two turns left.

12
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,700
What is there to think?

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,320
Just...

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,140
Just go!

15
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,600
I was literally the last.

16
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,500
I rolled the lowest die, so I was the last person.

17
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,800
I had the last turn.

18
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,760
So I had to wait 20 hours until it was my turn.

19
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,140
And I'm just like, what is there to think?

20
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,440
We all know who's gonna lose anyway.

21
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
I got...

22
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,620
Two turns at the end was so rough.

23
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,680
Did we win?

24
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,720
We all won.

25
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,920
Except for one person.

26
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,800
That's how it should have been.

27
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,860
As it should be.

28
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,400
Okay, give me a sec.

29
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,000
I need to make sure my Silent Hill is...

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,280
Okay, I need to make sure the audio for Silent Hill is correct.

31
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,000
Before we begin.

32
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,160
God, I'm not looking forward to it.

33
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,220
Oh my god.

34
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,020
I think this game has to be one of the scariest games I've ever played in my life.

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,200
Definitely, I'm not looking forward to it.

36
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,740
I think Silent Hill is the scariest.

37
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,300
I don't think I've ever...

38
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,680
Okay, other than Visage.

39
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,220
Visage is very scary.

40
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,500
But I think...

41
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,080
The Silent Hill 2 has been very freaking freaky for me.

42
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,120
I think also because...

43
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,020
I think it's also because...

44
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,980
The fact that...

45
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,060
The monsters come back to life.

46
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,560
I don't like that.

47
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,860
I don't like the fact that the monsters come back to life.

48
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,980
They don't stay dead.

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,400
So I feel like I'm always...

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,900
I feel like I'm wasting materials.

51
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,860
Trying to kill them.

52
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,540
But I can't do anything else.

53
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,800
I can't do anything else.

54
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,960
That's the only thing I can do.

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,620
But yeah.

56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,040
But anyway, so...

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,100
I am not looking forward...

58
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,260
It's actually so scary.

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,220
I hate that.

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,320
I hate that part of the game.

61
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,700
Life update.

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,880
What do I have for life update?

63
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,620
Let me see.

64
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,520
I always write down life updates that I want to give...

65
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,340
Let you guys know.

66
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,520
Anything...

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,440
Any interesting life updates that I have.

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,180
Stuff is being shipped out.

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,300
Starting today.

70
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,900
Bundles will be shipped out very soon.

71
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,180
But a lot of items...

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,000
For solo items have started to ship out starting today.

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,080
Did I tell you guys?

74
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,600
Wait, did I tell you guys about the distributor thing?

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,760
It's solved now.

76
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,440
So...

77
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,160
Did I tell you?

78
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,860
I didn't even know if I updated you guys this.

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,740
Basically, me and the older distributor were able to establish contact again.

80
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,900
And we fixed the scenario about it.

81
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,080
So, the ex-director has nothing involved anymore.

82
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,320
Cannot do anything to the distributor anymore.

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,760
So, me and the old distributor was able to finally communicate.

84
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,860
And they're not holding my merch hostage anymore.

85
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,280
So, they started shipping stuff out starting today.

86
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,140
So, I'm happy about that.

87
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,340
So, thank fucking god.

88
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,220
That's one headache.

89
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,640
I don't have to worry about now.

90
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,720
So, bundles will be shipped out soon, TM.

91
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,880
Because we need a restock.

92
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,200
Because our ex-director did hold some merchandise hostage.

93
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,740
So, we don't have everything for the bundles.

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,600
Because we're missing some stuff for bundles.

95
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,880
So, we have to order restock.

96
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,720
But the distributor does have a lot of the things that we can ship out now.

97
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,740
So, thank fucking god.

98
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,960
Sadly, we won't be working with this old distributor.

99
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,360
Because we actually made a deal with a new distributor.

100
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,820
And we're running a test run with the new distributor.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,960
For the Doki Bird acrylic stand.

102
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,240
Let me show you guys what it looks like.

103
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,420
It looks really...

104
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,300
We're just waiting on it to be shipped over right now to our new distributor.

105
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,760
Because we were trying to figure out what the fuck to do at that point.

106
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,860
And we're like, alright, let's do a test run with this other distributor.

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,440
And oh my god.

108
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,940
So, you know how we have the acrylic stand?

109
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,520
So, this is what it looks like.

110
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,600
This is what it's gonna look like.

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,160
It looks really good.

112
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,540
I'm really happy with it.

113
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,320
Let me grab the image.

114
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:52,860
Oh my god.

115
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,000
It's a giant ass image.

116
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,140
Oh my god.

117
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,280
Let me resize this.

118
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,400
Also, I'm stalling.

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,520
I'm 100% stalling right now.

120
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,080
But yes!

121
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,760
This is what it looks like.

122
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,460
I know it looks different from what you bought.

123
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,240
But I wanted to thank you guys for waiting for so long.

124
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:20,300
This is what the acrylic stand looks like on the shop.

125
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,060
So, yeah.

126
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,700
This is what it's gonna look like.

127
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,460
This is gonna be with our new distributor.

128
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,980
And we're doing a test run with this.

129
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,260
And the moment we finally get all the merch stuff situated, I can take less sponsors.

130
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,140
Because that's the only...

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,300
I have to take sponsors because it's good supplement to income and the stuff I want to do.

132
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,520
Because I don't have the merch supplement right now.

133
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:57,540
So, the moment everything is fixed regarding distribution, I can finally do merchandise again.

134
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,560
And then I can take less sponsors.

135
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,760
Which is great.

136
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:10,500
Because less sponsors means more time for me to do more stuff that I want to do creative-wise.

137
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,680
Because then I don't have to worry about income.

138
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,900
I don't have to worry about income-wise and stuff.

139
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Because I need income to...

140
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,640
I need extra income for the ideas I want to do and everything.

141
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,520
So, I'm very excited working with this new distributor to see how that goes.

142
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,120
But, yeah.

143
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,360
I have so many ideas regarding merchandise I can finally do.

144
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,280
After this test run, if everything goes well with the test run, there's a lot of stuff I really, really want to do.

145
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,020
I wrote down some stuff that I want to do.

146
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:50,960
But...

147
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,340
It's not like sponsors don't give a lot of money.

148
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,100
They do.

149
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,900
But like...

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,000
Merchandising...

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,340
I think you guys know this.

152
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:07,700
But if I was able to focus on merchandising, it could make up at least 70% of my income.

153
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,760
But obviously, I can't.

154
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,060
Because I want to make sure you guys are getting the products that you ordered before.

155
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,360
And everything is situated.

156
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,980
So, the moment it's all fixed, I don't have to worry too much about sponsors and stuff.

157
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,900
And I can be a little bit more picky regarding what I want to do for sponsors.

158
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,060
Merchandising does a lot.

159
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,780
It does so much.

160
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,540
That's why a lot of companies end up becoming merch companies.

161
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,460
It doesn't matter how well a show does or a video game does.

162
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:45,820
If it's not merchandisable, That's why you see a lot of good shows and a lot of good games get cancelled.

163
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,860
Or they don't get a sequel or anything.

164
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
Because they're like, we can't make merch off of it.

165
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,760
There's no reason.

166
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,060
There's no reason to.

167
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,540
Because we can't make merch off of it.

168
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,880
That's why merchandising is so fucking important.

169
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,700
Because it does make up a lot of the income for people.

170
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,080
We finally fixed the distributor issue.

171
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,180
So, I'm really happy.

172
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,600
I sent photos of things being packaged today.

173
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,320
So, that was super exciting.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,160
Also, I found out the WrestleTuber belts are starting to arrive.

175
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,000
People are starting to receive the stuff from WrestleTuber.

176
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,840
Which is great.

177
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,600
I actually never got a chance to...

178
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,360
Because I was so busy.

179
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,240
I never asked for a photo of what the belt actually looks like in person.

180
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,500
Other than the graphics I provided.

181
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,540
I actually never got a chance to see what the physical item looks like.

182
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,300
But I saw BuffPuff and Meriwether recently received their belts.

183
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,460
And this is what it looks like.

184
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,480
It looks so cool.

185
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,400
It looks amazing.

186
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,660
It actually looks amazing.

187
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:52,900
Basically...

188
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,200
The people who won the show matches and the tournament winners get their belt.

189
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,840
And...

190
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,700
Oh my god.

191
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,280
It looks fucking amazing.

192
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:11,040
So, huge shoutout for Gamersubs for basically sponsoring the creation of the belts.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,460
They basically paid for the belts and stuff for everybody.

194
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,920
But yeah.

195
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,220
I'm really happy with how that turned out.

196
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,120
So, I think that is all the life updates.

197
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,020
Let me see if there's any other life updates I have.

198
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,620
I love stalling when I...

199
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,960
Thank god for stalling.

200
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,560
Let's go.

201
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,380
Wings, thank you for the superchat.

202
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,100
Thank you, thank you.

203
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,720
Please, for the love of god, make a croaky plushie that when you hug it has that laugh from when you first showed up as croaky.

204
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,880
Thank you for the superchat.

205
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,920
Thank you, thank you.

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,120
Well...

207
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,360
That's all I'll say.

208
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,740
Sooner than you think.

209
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,840
Sooner than you think.

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,420
Good!

211
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,720
Thank you for the superchat.

212
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,740
Thank you, thank you.

213
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,840
In one stream today, Beto just passed you in this game.

214
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,040
Make sure he gets his belt.

215
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,960
Thank you for the superchat.

216
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,980
Thank you, thank you.

217
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,020
Wait, did he just started playing today?

218
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,940
Like, bro, this game is freaky, man.

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,080
This game... Oh my god, this game is really scary, guys.

220
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,900
I don't know, guys.

221
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,200
This game is so scary.

222
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,440
I've never, like...

223
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,500
Every other game, I've never wanted to stall as much as this game.

224
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,200
Because it actually...

225
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,200
Oh my god, like...

226
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,640
There's just something about this game that's just really...

227
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,060
It, like, fucks me up.

228
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,060
It actually... Oh my god.

229
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,420
It, like, actually is one of the scariest games I've ever played.

230
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,120
Because the gun does nothing.

231
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,800
The gun does fucking nothing!

232
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,800
They

233
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:05,770
come back to life.

234
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,370
What's the point?

235
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,410
They come back to life.

236
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,810
They come back to life.

237
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,250
Thank you for the superchat.

238
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:10,930
Thank you, thank you.

239
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,650
And thank you for helping me stall longer.

240
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,110
Doki, could you really be in this town?

241
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,950
Pasta, thank you for the superchat.

242
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,810
Thank you, thank you.

243
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,250
I know it's scary, Doki.

244
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,550
It is for me, too.

245
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,610
And I played and beat the OG many times.

246
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,550
But you and your streams are bright lights in a dark time right now.

247
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,710
Thank you for the superchat.

248
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,770
Thank you, thank you.

249
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,510
Okay, I'm ready.

250
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,470
Oh my god, I'm not.

251
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,670
Disclaimer, I'm not actually ready.

252
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,470
I'm not ready.

253
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,850
But I'm ready.

254
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,010
But I'm not.

255
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,770
Guys, I hope tomorrow we get knocked out in the first game.

256
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,870
It's, like, best of... I don't remember.

257
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,890
It's, like, knockout stage.

258
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,270
So you lose the matches, you're out of the game.

259
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,350
So I hope tomorrow we get knocked out instantly.

260
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,290
So then I don't have to... we only stream for, like, an hour.

261
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,050
And then we rest until 9pm.

262
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,610
By the way, tomorrow's tournament for Shinova.

263
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,590
We're not sponsored by it, by the way.

264
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,890
Superchat, just so you can stall...

265
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,010
Oh, thanks, Alan!

266
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,230
Thank you for the superchat.

267
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,570
Thank you, thank you.

268
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,270
Django, thank you for the superchat.

269
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,130
Thank you, thank you.

270
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,090
Stalling funds.

271
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,270
Oh my god, you guys shouldn't have.

272
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,910
Thank you for the superchat.

273
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,330
Thank you, thank you.

274
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,270
Oh my god, guys.

275
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,430
I'm gonna open up Streamlabs.

276
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,210
Oh my god, guys.

277
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,330
Oh my god, guys.

278
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,110
I just realized it's been so long since I've looked at my Streamlabs, guys.

279
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:46,770
I might as well, you know, for everybody here, I might as well open my Streamlabs, guys.

280
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,590
Just so... just cause, like, I must have missed so many Streamlabs donations.

281
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,130
Oh my god, I gotta catch up.

282
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,830
Did you guys donate on Streamlabs?

283
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,350
Oh my god, let me check.

284
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,950
Let me make sure, guys, that I read all of your donations.

285
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:11,050
And make sure that, like, you are all represented in my superchat reading.

286
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,970
Oh my god, Kilzerk, thank you for the donation!

287
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,970
On the 15th!

288
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,310
On the 15th!

289
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,350
You, yeah, you, the person who might read this.

290
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,030
I hope you're resting well.

291
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,050
Wow, thank you, Kilzerk.

292
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,710
I really appreciate that.

293
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,330
Anyway, Wings, thank you for the super... oh wait, sorry.

294
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,450
D-Dragon, thank you for the superchat.

295
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,510
Thank you, thank you.

296
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,670
Um, Scared Game, you ever played?

297
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,270
Doki, please, play the OG and see which is it.

298
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:54,110
No, because you're behind due to... by the way, you're behind due to all of this stalling.

299
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,270
Thank you for the superchat.

300
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,350
Thank you, thank you.

301
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,390
Snooks, thank you for the superchat.

302
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,470
Thank you, thank you.

303
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,010
It's a more comedy from the side of the screen.

304
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,750
Good luck, Doki.

305
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,150
We enjoy Scaredy Bird.

306
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,130
Thank you for the superchat.

307
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,230
Thank you, thank you.

308
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,970
Wings, thank you for the superchat.

309
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,790
Thank you, thank you.

310
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,630
Doki, it's okay.

311
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:16,190
I want you to take comfort in the fact that if we were in a haunted house that any dragon you were with would make you go first.

312
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,110
That's fucked up.

313
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,650
That is so fucked up.

314
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,630
Thank you for the superchat.

315
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,290
Thank you, thank you.

316
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:26,370
Speaking of haunted houses, next week I'm gonna go to... I'm actually gonna go touch grass next week.

317
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:41,590
Because next week, I managed to convince a friend to go with me to a haunted house.

318
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,630
I know, I know it's crazy.

319
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,950
I know, I can't believe it.

320
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,110
Willingly, I consented to it too.

321
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,650
I actually consented to it.

322
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,950
And I convinced a friend to come with me to travel to me just to...

323
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:04,530
To travel to my city to go to a haunted house.

324
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,150
I was like, are you busy next week?

325
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,270
And they were like, no, I don't think so.

326
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,750
I was like, come over to a haunted house.

327
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,950
Travel all the way here to a haunted house.

328
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,550
Hahaha

329
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,210
Airborne Ninja, thank you for the superchat.

330
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,490
Thank you, thank you.

331
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,330
If the gun did something, would it be as scary?

332
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,730
Also, just hit them with a stick.

333
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,430
James is a...

334
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,230
But they come back to life!

335
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,810
They actually come back to life.

336
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,350
That's so fucked up.

337
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,710
That's the worst part.

338
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,470
Ninja, thank you for the superchat.

339
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,350
Thank you, thank you.

340
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,970
Mic donation, reading time.

341
00:17:47,970 --> 00:18:04,210
You know what the fact that this works is because the really fucked up part is that this works because like we haven't had a super chat reading time in a long time, so like, it's always been like a gotcha if I see your super chat in time to read it in time,

342
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,810
so like, thank you for enabling me.

343
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,850
We're stalling, but you guys, the real problem is you guys for enabling this.

344
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,330
Uh,

345
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,030
Mike, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

346
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,470
Donation reading time.

347
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,370
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

348
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,690
Funds to ensure you stop stalling.

349
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,530
Uh, Neppers, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

350
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,670
Stalling can also refer to aircraft and engines.

351
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,050
Uh, SleepyAsh, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

352
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,290
Your stream is helping me stall this essay due, and okay, wait, I'm not here to be a bad example here.

353
00:18:43,550 --> 00:19:01,390
Wait, guys, I, guys, we all, guys, all I'm saying is that, uh, all I'm saying is that, look, I know like, we were, I was giving the wrong message in my sponsored stream this morning, but guys, I, you watched me to realize what you shouldn't be doing.

354
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:14,970
Guys, I show you guys what a bad person is, like, I'm here to show you guys, like, what happens, um, if you're destined to go to hell.

355
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,070
Uh, SleepyAsh, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

356
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,910
Oh, wait, I already read that.

357
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,250
Influx, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

358
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,350
Um, hey, Doki, say you didn't want to play the Yakuza games because they took, uh, your dad's too long to beat.

359
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,450
If that's a problem, you should check out, like, a dragon.

360
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,530
It's a super, okay, I'm pretty sure that's also, like, really fucking long.

361
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,490
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

362
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,330
How long to beat?

363
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,890
Oh, shit, it's, like, 12 hours.

364
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,090
Wouldn't I need to know, like, the story, though, for, like, a dragon?

365
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,890
I heard they were making a pirate game, too.

366
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:02,770
Um, I heard they're making a, uh, a pirate game in the future of Yakuza.

367
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,710
Guys, this, okay, I shouldn't keep stalling.

368
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,670
I...

369
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,490
But I read there was a birthday supa, so we have one more stall.

370
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,350
And thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

371
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,050
Hi, Doki, first supa and first stall supa.

372
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,690
It's also my birthday!

373
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,150
Can I request a little... Of course!

374
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:31,450
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, dear Anne, happy birthday to you.

375
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,010
Yay!

376
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,040
Alright.

377
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,720
I'm ready.

378
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,660
Oh, I'm fucking ready.

379
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,940
Okay.

380
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,060
Here we go.

381
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,720
Oh, my God.

382
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,580
Alright, this is it.

383
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,700
Oh, my God.

384
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,900
Kielcer, thank you for the aka supa!

385
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,440
Thank you, thank you!

386
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,600
Thank you, Kielcer!

387
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,880
That really means so much!

388
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,880
Thank you!

389
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,320
Oh, my God, where am I?

390
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,280
Oh, I remember where I am now.

391
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,820
I remember.

392
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,060
Okay, I still remember.

393
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,040
What do I do?

394
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,760
Wait, what do I do?

395
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Oh, no, I don't remember.

396
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,860
Do I have anything in my inventory?

397
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,440
What do I have?

398
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,020
Guys, what...

399
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,280
What do I have?

400
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,540
I don't remember.

401
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,620
I actually don't remember.

402
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,840
Where do I go?

403
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,640
Yeah, I did.

404
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,120
I put the hour hand in.

405
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,620
But, like, where do I go after?

406
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,980
Guys, this is not stalling.

407
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,220
I'm actually confused.

408
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,820
Where do I go?

409
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,020
Check the clock?

410
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,410
Check the clock?

411
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,190
Well, that's the... Is this the hour hand?

412
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,430
Oh, I got the hour hand.

413
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,630
So I should go to the left.

414
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,700
Oh, no, it's this way.

415
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,600
Oh, there you go.

416
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,660
Oh, that's freaky.

417
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,720
Oh, that's freaky.

418
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,720
I don't like that.

419
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,660
That's... Oh, I don't like that sound.

420
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:27,380
Oh, I don't know.

421
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm really... I'm really sad.

422
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,100
I'm really sad.

423
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,760
Okay.

424
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,040
Alright.

425
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,340
It's time to go forward.

426
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,540
Guys, how do I heal again?

427
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,220
Guys, what's the button to heal, guys?

428
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,380
Customize, control, dodge, reload.

429
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,800
Where the fuck is the heal?

430
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,200
Where is the heal?

431
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,500
Okay.

432
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,000
V, okay.

433
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,060
V, okay.

434
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,900
Alright.

435
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,760
I don't remember how to play this game already.

436
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,160
I don't remember.

437
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,220
Hello, women.

438
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,540
The life of the party is here.

439
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,300
Hello, ladies.

440
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,080
Ladies.

441
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,340
Ladies.

442
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, hey.

443
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,060
Okay, alright.

444
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,880
Okay.

445
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,840
Here we go.

446
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,520
I'm not ready.

447
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,020
What's in this bathroom?

448
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,520
Oh, my God.

449
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,280
Hello.

450
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,540
Oh.

451
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,220
Oh.

452
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,320
Stick your hand in the toilet.

453
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,360
What could go wrong?

454
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,520
Let's go.

455
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,920
What can go wrong?

456
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm just gonna lose an entire arm.

457
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,020
No way.

458
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,840
This is just all in my mind.

459
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,380
It's all in my mind.

460
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,480
What?

461
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,320
Okay.

462
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,950
This is not real.

463
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,030
It's all in your mind, James.

464
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,430
None of this is real.

465
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,590
None of this is real, James.

466
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,890
None of it is real.

467
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,910
You just... You have to stop taking your meds, James.

468
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,550
You know what they say.

469
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,250
If you stop taking your meds, your dead wife won't be dead no more.

470
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,430
You can still hear her.

471
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,290
Oh, no.

472
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,430
It's a puzzle within a fucking puzzle.

473
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,790
Like, what more do you want from me?

474
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,630
Oh, hey.

475
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,310
Hey, there.

476
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,310
Wait, is this the one that spits?

477
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,350
I can't remember.

478
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,330
It is.

479
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,430
Oh, it is.

480
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,670
Yeah, that's the spitty one.

481
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,270
Oh, my God.

482
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,450
This is why I don't play this.

483
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,330
This is why I don't play this one more than once a week.

484
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,190
I do not play this one more than once.

485
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:46,950
Oh, my God.

486
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,770
What the fuck?

487
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,370
Why is there a puzzle within a goddamn puzzle?

488
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,870
Are you not... Do you not have enough?

489
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,110
Do you not have enough of me?

490
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,070
I'm trying to fucking figure out what to do in life.

491
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,630
Okay.

492
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,890
Oh, my God.

493
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,410
Okay.

494
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,570
Reload.

495
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,150
Alright.

496
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,170
Do I go left or right?

497
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,670
I guess right.

498
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,310
But, like, what if there's something funny on the left side?

499
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,130
Could be something silly.

500
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,250
Silly.

501
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,340
Where am I?

502
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,520
I didn't expect actually something silly here.

503
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,460
Anything silly?

504
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,900
Hello?

505
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,550
Hello?

506
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:00,790
Wait.

507
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,150
Wait.

508
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:02,930
Wait.

509
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:03,890
I didn't mean it.

510
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:08,630
I don't... I don't... I don't want the silly.

511
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,910
I was joking.

512
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:11,890
Please.

513
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,010
Keep it the same.

514
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,850
I don't want the silly no more.

515
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:17,850
No.

516
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,470
No, I wasn't.

517
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,090
Guys, I wasn't.

518
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,910
I would never give you ASMR for free.

519
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,670
You know that.

520
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,490
Guys, I would never do that.

521
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,470
What?

522
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,190
Hello?

523
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,570
Is that a bee?

524
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,030
Is that... Oh, what is that?

525
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,900
My God.

526
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,000
What the fuck?

527
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,780
The fuck is this?

528
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,560
Figurine part?

529
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,320
The fuck is that?

530
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,660
I don't know what that was.

531
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,780
What the fuck?

532
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,120
Oh, this is a normal guy.

533
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,500
I know... I know you don't spit.

534
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,660
I know you don't spit.

535
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,800
Get out!

536
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,700
You don't spit.

537
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,720
You swa...

538
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,520
I'm sorry.

539
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,120
What about paid stalling ASMR?

540
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,800
Thank you for the super chat.

541
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,740
Thank you.

542
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,920
Thank you.

543
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,840
Okay, alright.

544
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,780
Thank you for the super chat.

545
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,100
Thank you.

546
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,600
Thank you.

547
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,120
Have you ever been... Wait, I am Canadian.

548
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,100
What do you mean?

549
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,300
Thank you for the super chat.

550
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:50,960
Thank you.

551
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,620
Thank you.

552
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,040
I knew... No!

553
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,520
I'm predictable now!

554
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,080
You can make an AI of the things I'd say now.

555
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,680
No!

556
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,320
I can't... Technically, I feel like you can actually make an AI of the, like, Doki Bird sayings.

557
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,740
Alright.

558
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,280
You guys know me too well.

559
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,700
I actually want to try that.

560
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,500
Like, I saw like some VTubers made like a... Like, you know, fun AI.

561
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,420
There's like bad AI, but then there's also fun AI.

562
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,280
And one of the fun AIs is literally just like... Also like... Am I lagging a little bit?

563
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,080
I can't tell.

564
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,820
Maybe it's because I have 200 things running in the background.

565
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,460
Let me... Guys, do you think that's a possibility?

566
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,840
Let me close some tabs real quick.

567
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:48,720
Alright.

568
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,580
Let me close some stuff real quick.

569
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,940
Oh yeah, I know 100%.

570
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,200
I have a lot of tabs open.

571
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,780
Let me close some tabs real quick.

572
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,240
Okay, wait.

573
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,540
I need to keep... Not this one.

574
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,380
This tab is very important.

575
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,680
Oh, this tab is also very important.

576
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,060
Guys, don't worry.

577
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm getting there.

578
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,440
Okay, and then I'll delete these.

579
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,840
And...

580
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,500
And then I'll delete this.

581
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,620
Okay, I should be a little better now, right?

582
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,380
Not for free?

583
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,260
Okay.

584
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,380
Thank you for the Akasupa, Ninja.

585
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,340
Thank you, thank you.

586
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,400
Wait, how did your super make me lag even more?

587
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,950
How does that...

588
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,150
Thank you for the Akasupa.

589
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,650
Thank you, thank you.

590
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:43,010
I think also I didn't restart my... Okay, let me put the frames...

591
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,310
Let's not put it in limited.

592
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,330
Oh, 60?

593
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,030
Really?

594
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,750
Nah, we'll be fine.

595
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,230
We'll be fine.

596
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:52,990
There we go.

597
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,650
Okay, the weight of that super.

598
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,430
What the fuck did I do with this?

599
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,770
Let me know if I'm still lagging a little.

600
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,480
Okay, can I bash this?

601
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:07,720
No.

602
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh, I can.

603
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,360
I feel me, I'm good.

604
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,040
There we go.

605
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,620
What the fuck is this?

606
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,880
Oh, 2-1-1.

607
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:21,980
Okay.

608
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,470
I don't know.

609
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,690
I don't feel safe in here.

610
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,190
Okay.

611
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,270
Oh my god, alright.

612
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,050
Let me go grab some stuff.

613
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,150
Just give me ammo!

614
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,110
Like, give me some heals!

615
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:56,110
For anyone who talks Adoki and play the Silent Hill radio... No, that's fucked up, bro.

616
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,710
That is so fucked up.

617
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,790
What have I ever... Oh my god, look at... Ooh.

618
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,290
See those cheeks?

619
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,730
Let's shoot her right there.

620
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,530
Is she gonna do one at me?

621
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,790
Got you!

622
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,570
I saw it.

623
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,370
I didn't see that, though.

624
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,550
I didn't see that, though.

625
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,930
God damn it.

626
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,430
Wait, was she just there?

627
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,790
Oh my god, I got baited.

628
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,570
I actually got fucking baited.

629
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,070
Okay, because for that Aka... Hey boy, what you doing?

630
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,370
Hey there.

631
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,570
You see those cheeks?

632
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,490
Pew pew!

633
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,470
Okay, um...

634
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,510
Alright, I ate some medication.

635
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,460
Oh, hey.

636
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,020
Oh, thank fucking god.

637
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,440
That's what I needed.

638
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,800
That's actually what I needed there.

639
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,560
Did I do the puzzle correctly?

640
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:23,780
Alright.

641
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,960
I guess it's puzzle time.

642
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,980
I swear to god.

643
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,100
Be gone.

644
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,500
Be gone!

645
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,400
I might not have taken my meds!

646
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,640
Be gone, wench!

647
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,780
Alright, let's do the puzzle.

648
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,040
Um...

649
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,140
Oh.

650
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,600
Oh, I have to combine them.

651
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,860
Okay, give me a sec.

652
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,680
Um, it'll be very awkward if he comes back to life while I'm trying to combine shit.

653
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,940
Okay, there we go.

654
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,140
God, that looks so ugly.

655
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,500
Like, what happened to it?

656
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,520
Alright.

657
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,300
Okay.

658
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,000
I guess I'll put him here.

659
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,260
Okay.

660
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,070
I guess I'll put... What kind of puzzle is this?!

661
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,220
It's trial and error!

662
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,740
This is not a natural puzzle!

663
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,040
It's literally trial and error!

664
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,100
Okay.

665
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,360
Alright, back into the keyhole.

666
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,280
The key goes into the keyhole.

667
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,800
Oh, don't tell me to go... God fucking... Okay.

668
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,000
Go downstairs time.

669
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,160
Downstairs time.

670
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,180
Down I go.

671
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,860
Alright.

672
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,540
Hello?

673
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,100
What am I looking at?

674
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,680
It's a broken table.

675
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,580
We've seen so many broken things already.

676
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,560
What's... Oh no, there's...

677
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,160
That's a lot of places I haven't been to.

678
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,460
Oh no.

679
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,460
Oh no.

680
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,800
That's a lot of areas I haven't been to.

681
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,440
Oh no.

682
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,320
Are you fucking serious?

683
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,540
Oh, thank God.

684
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,100
More ammo.

685
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,200
That's fine.

686
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,760
Oh, and more heals.

687
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,040
That's also fine.

688
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,580
Okay.

689
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,980
Thank you for not softlocking me.

690
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,380
I really appreciate it.

691
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,600
Because I don't know what I'll do if I get softlocked.

692
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,540
I'll actually cry.

693
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,020
Please don't make me cry.

694
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,500
Please.

695
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,040
That's all I ask.

696
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,980
Oh no, I guess I'll go this way.

697
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,780
Hello?

698
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,120
Hey there.

699
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,440
I don't like that the hallway is so dark over there.

700
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,340
I mean, at least somebody's paying the electricity bill.

701
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:01,980
You know?

702
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,400
Because I know I'm like walking.

703
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,880
And I could be not walking.

704
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,440
But you don't understand, guys.

705
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,720
I have a lot of fears right now.

706
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,320
And walking is the only way that can help me.

707
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,760
Oh hey, at least somebody's doing graffiti.

708
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,380
Pyramidhead is paying the bills.

709
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,300
We share a bank account!

710
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,780
He's literally... He's not supposed to be paying anything.

711
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,360
Like, I'm literally the one taking care of both of us right now.

712
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,340
He's literally me.

713
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,720
We're sharing a fucking bank account.

714
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,620
Wait, what?

715
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,020
Who's here?

716
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,660
Hello?

717
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,380
Who are you?

718
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,260
Who are you?

719
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,760
Angela?

720
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,660
Is that the girl from the graveyard?

721
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,260
Guys, I feel like it's been 20 years.

722
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,600
I literally forgot about it.

723
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,160
I forgot what she looked like.

724
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,860
I forgot what this fucking girl looked like.

725
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,080
It's been so long.

726
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,540
I feel like I've been in Silent Hill for like 5 years now.

727
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,880
Her?

728
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,820
Me?

729
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,680
Wait, that knife is bloody.

730
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,540
Who did you stab?

731
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,870
I'm sorry.

732
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,300
What the fuck is going on?

733
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,900
Is she also part of my imagination?

734
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,700
Yet?

735
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,920
How did you get here?

736
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,000
I just figured because this is where you're looking for her.

737
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,380
How else would I know?

738
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,480
Yeah.

739
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,920
Like, why are you here?

740
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,120
Why else would you be here?

741
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,890
Is she okay?

742
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,030
What does she see in Silent Hill?

743
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,210
Because every time, each person sees Silent Hill differently.

744
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,570
Also, I wonder what she sees.

745
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,580
No one is okay in this game.

746
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,360
I'm okay!

747
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,780
James seems like a very perfectly well-adjusted human being.

748
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,120
Who just happens to not take his meds.

749
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,100
Because he's all better now, guys.

750
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,380
I don't know either.

751
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,540
Okay.

752
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,160
I'm not crazy.

753
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,440
I'm just trying to find my very much alive dead wife.

754
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,620
Don't.

755
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm definitely not crazy.

756
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,440
You have a knife!

757
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,380
Well, how would you slow me down?

758
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,380
You can stab them.

759
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,420
You've clearly done it before.

760
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,800
You've got a fucking knife with blood on it.

761
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,740
Woah!

762
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,260
Woah!

763
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,920
Woah!

764
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,440
Lady!

765
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,360
What the fuck did you do, man?

766
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,000
Do you see the hot, sexy monsters too, like me?

767
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,200
By the way, I know this is an inappropriate question to ask, but I'm just curious.

768
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,560
Oh cool, I got a knife.

769
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,700
Angela's knife.

770
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,000
Can I stab her?

771
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,040
Stab people with it?

772
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,420
Not her, sorry.

773
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,440
Sorry, that was a slip of tongue.

774
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,580
I did not mean that I wanna stab her.

775
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,450
It's not a usable weapon?

776
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,970
The fuck is that for then?

777
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,310
Okay, guys.

778
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,870
I drank a lot of water, so I'm gonna hydrate before I go out there.

779
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,670
For my safety.

780
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,770
I'll be right back.

781
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:50,850
I'm back.

782
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,390
Sorry, I also had to turn on both my lights.

783
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,670
My hallway light and my living room light too.

784
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,810
Because you know why.

785
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,590
I had to make sure I turned on both.

786
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:09,550
Guys, my morning sponsor is gonna pay my electricity bill.

787
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,970
Don't worry.

788
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,110
The sponsor I did this morning will pay it off.

789
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,770
It'll pay off my entire Silent Hill run.

790
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,010
Guys, no, you don't understand.

791
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:29,810
It's getting dark.

792
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:30,870
It's winter now.

793
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:31,910
It's almost winter.

794
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,270
It's getting dark right now.

795
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,510
You guys don't understand.

796
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:40,010
It's getting dark.

797
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,590
Oh my god.

798
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:46,170
Why?

799
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,110
Why?

800
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,530
That's all I wanna know.

801
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,770
Why is it like this?

802
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,890
Why is it like this?

803
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:56,130
Okay.

804
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,950
Everything is fine.

805
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,850
Okay, I'm okay.

806
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,770
I'm okay.

807
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,390
Did I go here before?

808
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,550
It's here.

809
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,350
Okay, it's there.

810
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,530
Okay.

811
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,130
Be brave.

812
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,390
Be brave.

813
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:21,630
Be brave.

814
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,370
Oh, I hate.

815
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,870
I hate.

816
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,610
I wanna be back outside.

817
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:26,710
I don't wanna be inside no more.

818
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:31,050
I don't wanna be in these goddamn fucking tight corridors.

819
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,010
Okay.

820
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:34,390
Open.

821
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:36,350
Hello.

822
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,530
Dude, we're not even in the hospital yet.

823
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,590
That's the worst part.

824
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,390
Doki, how do you know about the hospital?

825
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,430
Because the nurses had to come from somewhere.

826
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,910
I watched Silent Hill.

827
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,570
The movie.

828
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:55,130
The nurses has to come from somewhere, so I assume it comes from the fucking hospital.

829
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:01,630
Okay.

830
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:09,830
Okay.

831
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,150
I marked that off.

832
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,750
Good job.

833
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:12,990
Good job, James.

834
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,570
Dr. Cranberry, thank you for the super chat.

835
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:15,910
Thank you.

836
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:16,350
Thank you.

837
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:17,170
Winter is coming.

838
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,130
Our crops have dried up before their expected yield.

839
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,530
It will be a hard winter.

840
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,010
We will starve.

841
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,370
This is how I feel when I play this game.

842
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,810
This is how I feel.

843
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,110
Hello?

844
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:33,910
Hello?

845
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,350
Hello?

846
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,190
Woah.

847
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,930
Woah there.

848
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:41,870
Woah.

849
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:46,490
When I say hello, I didn't mean for you to say hello back.

850
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,430
It was just a figure of expression.

851
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,670
You don't have to say hi back.

852
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,570
In fact, I encourage you not to say hi back.

853
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,090
What's this?

854
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,910
Read.

855
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,670
Ver la flemme.

856
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,960
Oh my god.

857
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,440
Okay.

858
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:16,480
Okay.

859
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,620
Paladin Knight, thank you for the super chat.

860
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:20,940
Thank you.

861
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,220
Thank you.

862
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,020
Here's to free Doki.

863
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,440
You should look at that picture of Mary in your inventory a lot throughout the game.

864
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,200
It will comfort you.

865
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:26,840
Which picture?

866
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,800
This one?

867
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,700
I mean, that's just my... that's my dead wife.

868
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,440
Right there.

869
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,660
Thank you for the super chat.

870
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,060
Thank you.

871
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:37,480
Thank you.

872
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,900
She does not look very comforting.

873
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,280
I'm just gonna say it.

874
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,360
I do not feel any joy looking at that photo right now.

875
00:48:52,590 --> 00:49:00,190
Like, I guess if I haven't seen women in a long time, I'd be like, whoa, man, my dead wife sure does get me going right now.

876
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,790
But I think that's inappropriate.

877
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:04,530
I don't know.

878
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,730
Just a little bit.

879
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,650
Might be a bit inappropriate right there.

880
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,190
Oh, what the fuck?

881
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:11,830
What the fuck?

882
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,930
You can't do that.

883
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,490
What the fuck?

884
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,030
Oh, hey.

885
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,110
Nice.

886
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,390
Forever together.

887
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,350
Okay.

888
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:26,730
Okay.

889
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,790
Alright.

890
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,490
Gotta reload.

891
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,180
Like, how the fuck did she know I was gonna shoot?

892
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,860
Okay, into this corner I go.

893
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,840
Okay, unlock the door.

894
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,820
Door unlocked.

895
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,800
Where the fuck am I?

896
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,140
Where am I?

897
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,820
Where is this place?

898
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:00,960
Oh, clock!

899
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,260
Clock, clock, clock.

900
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,660
Right here.

901
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,800
Alright, oh my god, we made it back.

902
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,160
Oh, thank god, we made it back.

903
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,880
We made it back.

904
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:19,460
Oh my god, I swear, this has to be the slowest Silent Hill run of everybody's lives.

905
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,980
Where is it supposed to go?

906
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,020
Here we go.

907
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,060
Alright, now we go to the M.

908
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,120
Oh my god.

909
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,600
Now we go to M.

910
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,940
You can brute force?

911
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah, but I'm...

912
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,280
What do you take me for?

913
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,120
I'm smarter than you think, guys.

914
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:45,880
I think.

915
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:47,240
Okay.

916
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,380
Alright, this way.

917
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:49,460
Okay.

918
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,100
Alright.

919
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,000
Are there bosses in Silent Hill?

920
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,900
There has to be.

921
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,740
Like, I gotta fight Pyramid Head one day, right?

922
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,920
Like, I've just been fighting little babies.

923
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,880
There has to be a boss in Silent Hill.

924
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,790
M, M, M, M, M.

925
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,230
Oh, someone's a masochist.

926
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:14,650
Hello.

927
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:17,390
Oh.

928
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,450
Oh, M for Moth.

929
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,130
Can't be that dangerous.

930
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:23,690
Oh, that's a little...

931
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,170
A little peephole right there.

932
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:27,490
Oh, okay.

933
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:31,350
Let me destroy this first before anything.

934
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:32,930
Alright.

935
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,750
M for Morphosis, you're right.

936
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,570
Okay, there's the death... there's the...

937
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,370
Oh, wait.

938
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,290
There's another Moth.

939
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,310
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

940
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,150
Oh, is this a puzzle?

941
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,530
Oh, no.

942
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,110
Oh, there's another one.

943
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,250
It's right here.

944
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,530
And then there's... what am I supposed to do with all these Moths?

945
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,210
Oh, wait.

946
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,910
It is a puzzle.

947
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:54,690
Okay.

948
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:57,930
Alright.

949
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:01,690
Okay.

950
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:03,610
There's that.

951
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:04,530
There's the tiger.

952
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,610
There's the orange Moth.

953
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:08,090
What is this puzzle?

954
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,200
M minus...

955
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,080
There's numbers?

956
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,690
There's numbers?

957
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,630
What do the numbers mean?

958
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:34,270
There's...

959
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,170
It doesn't even tell me what the numbers mean.

960
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,990
Like, it doesn't even tell me what number is what.

961
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:48,010
Like, how the fuck am I supposed to know what Moth equals what number?

962
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,570
Where's that intel?

963
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,970
Swear to God, when I get here, I better get me some fucking intel.

964
00:52:58,970 --> 00:52:59,850
Okay.

965
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,430
I move.

966
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,400
Okay.

967
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,700
One tiger Moth.

968
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,080
Two dead Moths.

969
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,860
Okay.

970
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,940
Is that how many Moths are in this room?

971
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,260
Alright, guys.

972
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,420
Sesame Street time.

973
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,900
One, two... there's two of that Moths.

974
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,220
One...

975
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,400
Two...

976
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,140
Three...

977
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,320
Three Owl Moths.

978
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,860
And then...

979
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,340
Two of the other Moths.

980
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,440
Okay, three Owl Moths.

981
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,860
Okay, the fuck is the moon?

982
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:40,700
Oh, that one.

983
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,080
Okay.

984
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,340
One...

985
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,020
Minus...

986
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,860
Wait, what?

987
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,440
There was only one.

988
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,560
There's two.

989
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,020
There's two.

990
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,320
Okay, two...

991
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,920
Two Night Moths.

992
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:56,880
Minus...

993
00:53:59,170 --> 00:53:59,490
Zero.

994
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:01,050
No.

995
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,210
Negative one.

996
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,390
The fuck?

997
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:08,590
Oh, I missed.

998
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,550
Oh, shit.

999
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:10,450
Zero.

1000
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,010
Okay, zero.

1001
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:14,650
Zero...

1002
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,790
And then we had...

1003
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,830
Two Tiger Moths.

1004
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:18,350
Okay.

1005
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,890
Two Death Moths.

1006
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:22,950
Plus three...

1007
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:23,510
So that's...

1008
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:24,730
Five...

1009
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,210
Five...

1010
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,470
Zero, five...

1011
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,470
One.

1012
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,410
Zero, five, one.

1013
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,530
Okay, zero...

1014
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:34,950
Wait, there's no zero.

1015
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,420
Guys...

1016
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,460
I think I'm gonna fail Sesame Street.

1017
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,760
One...

1018
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,240
Two...

1019
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,040
I thought there was three.

1020
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,680
Is there not three?

1021
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,500
Yeah, three!

1022
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,120
There's three of that.

1023
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,580
Three of that, so...

1024
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,300
Three minus...

1025
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,060
Owl...

1026
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,480
One...

1027
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,400
Two...

1028
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,380
Three!

1029
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,060
That's zero!

1030
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,590
Is there not a z-

1031
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:26,710
I swear to god, the moon's facing the wrong way.

1032
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:27,530
See?

1033
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,990
One...

1034
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,130
Two...

1035
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,790
Three.

1036
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,550
Is it the amount of wings?

1037
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,210
Oh my god, okay.

1038
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:45,990
One...

1039
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:52,990
Two...

1040
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,450
Oh my god, it's the amount of wings.

1041
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:58,210
I...

1042
00:55:58,210 --> 00:55:59,530
There's no way.

1043
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,630
Cause that's four.

1044
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,030
And then...

1045
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,110
There's...

1046
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:05,710
The symbols.

1047
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,830
Is it the amount of symbols?

1048
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,350
One, two...

1049
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,090
Three...

1050
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,410
Oh my god, it's the symbols!

1051
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,130
Three, four...

1052
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:14,150
But then that's five!

1053
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,830
One, two...

1054
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:18,030
Three, four, five...

1055
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:22,270
That's five!

1056
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:25,510
One, two...

1057
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,490
Oh my god, it's one, two, three, four...

1058
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,910
Four...

1059
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,490
Five, six...

1060
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,250
Seven, eight...

1061
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,490
So eight minus five...

1062
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:38,970
Three, that's three.

1063
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:39,870
Okay, there's three.

1064
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,590
Oh my god, this is...

1065
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,590
This is dumb.

1066
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,110
I'm gonna put it here.

1067
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:49,610
Okay, three, okay...

1068
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,660
Oh my god, how many was...

1069
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,400
Was the fucking eyes again?

1070
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,860
One, two...

1071
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,840
Three...

1072
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,120
Four, five...

1073
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:02,980
Okay, five...

1074
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,680
Six, seven...

1075
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,500
Okay, seven...

1076
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,000
That's seven.

1077
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,820
And then...

1078
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:09,660
Oh my god...

1079
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,200
I already forgot how much was that again.

1080
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,160
Five!

1081
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,540
Okay, five minus two...

1082
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,040
Then it's three.

1083
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,660
That was...

1084
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,720
Oh my god, that was so dumb.

1085
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,780
I thought it was the amount of moffs.

1086
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,240
That was so stupid.

1087
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,280
I went with the amount of moffs, not the amount of symbols.

1088
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,640
Alright, stick your hand in!

1089
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,540
What's the worst that could happen?

1090
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,140
We've already stuck our hands in so many things!

1091
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:44,940
Guys!

1092
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,280
Surely this won't be no different!

1093
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,580
I ain't scared.

1094
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,440
Our hands have been through so much together.

1095
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,680
Alright, what's this?

1096
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,060
It's a needle.

1097
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,580
Oh, it's the second hand!

1098
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,220
Cool.

1099
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:03,680
Oh.

1100
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,540
Not cool.

1101
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,080
Alright, hello?

1102
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:14,720
Hello?

1103
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,830
Moshi moshi?

1104
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:27,110
Wait, I heard something back here.

1105
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,150
Hello?

1106
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:36,280
Who's that?

1107
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,980
Is that the seductress again?

1108
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,020
Begone, seductress.

1109
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,640
Hmm, where are you?

1110
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,330
I heard something.

1111
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,860
I know I heard something.

1112
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,240
Wait, what happened?

1113
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,740
Pyramid Head was here.

1114
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,880
He was here!

1115
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,200
Wait, he was here and he closed the door!

1116
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,740
Cause he was like, you're letting the hot air come out.

1117
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,000
That's him!

1118
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,000
He was here!

1119
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,160
And he didn't even say hi!

1120
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,400
What the fuck does Scott even mean at this point?

1121
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,120
I don't fucking... what?

1122
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,600
What the fuck does Scott mean?

1123
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:05,890
Like...

1124
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:06,290
How?

1125
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:07,590
How?

1126
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,370
I did it.

1127
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,350
I don't know.

1128
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,890
I don't know.

1129
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:23,690
I don't know.

1130
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,990
I don't know what that means.

1131
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,430
What does Scott equals 3?

1132
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:34,710
How?

1133
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,830
How does Scott equals 3?

1134
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,790
What does Scott even mean?

1135
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:44,890
How?

1136
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,930
Oh my god.

1137
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,530
You know, Scott, you know?

1138
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,790
You know, the silly guy?

1139
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:57,410
Was there any hint to tell me what the fuck Scott meant?

1140
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,920
There's the double doors I can go through?

1141
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,660
Which one?

1142
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,860
There's so many doors.

1143
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,120
I can't remember.

1144
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:17,620
Guys, I don't know where the double doors are.

1145
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,280
He's just 3.

1146
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:33,150
Oh my god.

1147
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,090
Where do I go?

1148
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:44,700
Below the current floor?

1149
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,980
I can go below?

1150
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,040
The fuck?

1151
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,100
Why did I get to this part of the map?

1152
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,220
Okay.

1153
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,340
Oh, I have to go downstairs.

1154
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:56,820
Okay.

1155
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,500
We go downstairs.

1156
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,220
Oh my god.

1157
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,320
Oh my god.

1158
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:02,800
Okay.

1159
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,080
Guys, I think like...

1160
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,620
I don't think I can play more than 2 hours for salad.

1161
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,000
Like mentally, I don't know.

1162
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,300
Mentally wise, I don't know.

1163
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,700
This game is actually...

1164
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,680
Oh my god.

1165
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,020
I just...

1166
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,140
Oh my god, this fucking game.

1167
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,040
Oh my god.

1168
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,840
Bro, this game is so fucking freaky.

1169
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,000
Wait, when the fuck?

1170
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,140
When was he there?

1171
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,260
I don't remember you being there.

1172
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,140
Huh?

1173
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,040
Is this a memory from the OG game?

1174
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,000
We've only been playing the game for 30...

1175
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,660
Guys, this feels like 7 hours of gameplay right now.

1176
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:12,080
You guys might think it's been 30 minutes.

1177
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,440
But for me, it was a lifetime.

1178
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,720
Oh my god.

1179
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,550
Oh my god, we're...

1180
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,730
S on the door?

1181
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:27,850
How do I get there?

1182
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,670
How the fuck do I get to the S on the door?

1183
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,630
Oh, I remember now.

1184
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:36,750
Okay.

1185
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,650
Oh, I hate this.

1186
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,330
Okay, here we go.

1187
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:56,290
Oh my god, okay, here we go.

1188
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,210
Oh hey, it's unlocked.

1189
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,110
Is it actually?

1190
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:12,770
What a nice guy, he unlocked it for me.

1191
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,250
What a nice guy.

1192
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,530
Such a nice boy.

1193
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:26,150
Asa, thank you for the superchat.

1194
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,530
Thank you, thank you.

1195
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:31,950
I can't believe you unlocked it for me.

1196
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:33,430
What a great guy.

1197
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,230
Such a great guy.

1198
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:42,990
What a bro.

1199
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:45,730
Hey there.

1200
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:47,670
Hey.

1201
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,390
Hey.

1202
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,490
Oh man, bro, you work out, bro?

1203
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:53,930
Look at those arms, man.

1204
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,070
You work out?

1205
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,070
Hello?

1206
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:02,230
Friendly?

1207
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,870
Guys.

1208
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:06,610
Guys!

1209
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:09,850
Guys!

1210
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:16,960
Guys.

1211
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,840
He does not seem very friendly, guys.

1212
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,800
Oh no.

1213
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,400
Oh no.

1214
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,140
Guys.

1215
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,620
I'm sorry.

1216
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:30,960
I'm sorry.

1217
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,180
He has thousands of HP?!

1218
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,640
Oh my god, my ammo.

1219
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,560
What is he gonna do, chase me?

1220
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,380
Loop the loop, loop the loop.

1221
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,100
Loop him around.

1222
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,480
He can't catch me.

1223
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,540
I'm sorry!

1224
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,820
I'm so sorry!

1225
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,280
I didn't mean to piss you off!

1226
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,900
He can't catch me.

1227
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,400
I thought it was over.

1228
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,780
Oh man, that's gonna be a shame.

1229
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,460
Oh no.

1230
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:27,440
We got this, guys.

1231
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,540
We got this, though.

1232
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,420
We got this.

1233
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,460
Hug the wall.

1234
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,660
Hug the wall.

1235
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,500
No, god!

1236
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:39,800
Okay, I'm sorry!

1237
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:42,340
I am so very sorry.

1238
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,120
I... whoa, okay.

1239
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:46,680
Okay.

1240
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,800
We have this now.

1241
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,540
He can't destroy all of them!

1242
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,440
Right?

1243
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,080
Okay, guys, I think he can.

1244
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,060
Guys, okay, this is our last one.

1245
01:06:59,120 --> 01:06:59,680
Guys.

1246
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,500
Guys!

1247
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,640
Apparently he can, guys!

1248
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,200
Whoa!

1249
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,500
I'm dead.

1250
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,760
My very first death!

1251
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,540
Are you serious?!

1252
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,280
I die.

1253
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,840
Oh my god!

1254
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:26,100
Like, that's so bullshit!

1255
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,180
Guys, that's okay.

1256
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,300
Guys, it's okay.

1257
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,480
I still...

1258
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,200
Guys, I...

1259
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,220
Oh my god, why is he so mean?

1260
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,840
Guys, it's all part of the plan now.

1261
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,520
Guys, it was all part of the plan, guys.

1262
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,900
Because now, now I get to keep the bullets I lost.

1263
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:53,900
Wait, I got an idea.

1264
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:56,720
Wait, what?

1265
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,260
Why did you do that?

1266
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:01,900
Bro, what?

1267
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,520
Why did you do that?

1268
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:04,760
I just...

1269
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,580
I didn't even do anything to you, bro!

1270
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,440
I just said, bro, do you work out?

1271
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,360
Man, like...

1272
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,920
I'm sorry, bro!

1273
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,800
I just wanted to ask if you worked out.

1274
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,480
Like...

1275
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,240
Oh my god.

1276
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,920
Is there a problem at home?

1277
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,460
Is your wife also dead?

1278
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,560
Oh, I know how that feels.

1279
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:26,820
But see, I use my anger in a more therapeutic way.

1280
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,840
You see, instead...

1281
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,080
I just think about all these...

1282
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:31,880
Whoa, okay.

1283
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,260
You know what I do, Pyramid Head?

1284
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:39,700
Instead of being angry, I pretend my dead wife is still alive.

1285
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,500
Like...

1286
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,540
Some people say that's unhealthy.

1287
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:47,860
Oh.

1288
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,580
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1289
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,860
Oh.

1290
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,620
Okay, I have an idea.

1291
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,260
Oh.

1292
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,420
I have an idea.

1293
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:09,940
Oh.

1294
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:11,900
I...

1295
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,180
Oh, he's angry.

1296
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,980
He's so angry.

1297
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:15,820
I'm sorry.

1298
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,240
Oh my god.

1299
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,500
This is as good as I could get.

1300
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,000
Oh, he's gonna grab now?

1301
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,540
Bro, what?

1302
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:26,660
Okay.

1303
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,540
Time to play Dark Souls, guys.

1304
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,300
Time to play Dark Souls.

1305
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,100
That's my idea.

1306
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:36,400
Okay.

1307
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,820
It's Dark Souls time.

1308
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,500
Oh my god, I thought it was...

1309
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,560
I thought it was over.

1310
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,920
I thought it was over.

1311
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,420
Oh my god, Wukong prepared me for this.

1312
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,740
Wukong prepared me for this.

1313
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,700
Oh my god, this is a Souls game.

1314
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:00,360
How much more is he gonna swing?

1315
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:00,720
Swing!

1316
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:03,380
Okay.

1317
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,280
Please, sir.

1318
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:10,360
Have you ever tried fucking chopping the other sexy monsters?

1319
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,260
It's not as fun as chopping me.

1320
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,060
I don't have to build like those other monsters.

1321
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,600
Oh god.

1322
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:17,740
Oh my god.

1323
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,480
Until he dies?

1324
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,420
Oh, he's...

1325
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:22,600
Hello?

1326
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,540
Oh.

1327
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,320
Hello.

1328
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,020
Is he...

1329
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,240
Oh, the siren!

1330
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,940
What if I...

1331
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:41,400
I'm sorry.

1332
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,240
I'm sorry.

1333
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,460
I'm so sorry.

1334
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,760
I'm so sorry.

1335
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,520
I'm sorry.

1336
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,580
I don't know.

1337
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,860
I thought he'd let me in.

1338
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,860
I thought he'd be too busy.

1339
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,460
He's like, you know what?

1340
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,660
I'll give him that one.

1341
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,420
I'll give him that one.

1342
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,800
I was like...

1343
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,040
I thought he'd be like, you know what?

1344
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,980
Here, you deserve this one hit.

1345
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,860
You deserve it.

1346
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,420
I don't know.

1347
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:22,700
I thought he'd give me that one.

1348
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,300
I thought he'd be chill like that.

1349
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,100
I don't know.

1350
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,200
I legitimately thought he'd be chill like that.

1351
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,240
Don't interrupt the man on his way to bingo.

1352
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,660
Guys, he was not chill.

1353
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:43,340
Guys, he was absolutely not chill like that.

1354
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,600
I thought...

1355
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,360
I was like, oh shit, man.

1356
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,480
A freebie?

1357
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,400
Do I get a freebie?

1358
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:53,800
I didn't.

1359
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:57,620
In the end, Yoki did not get a freebie.

1360
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,300
He was not chill.

1361
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,180
Guys, he was not chill.

1362
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:06,460
Why did nobody warn me that he wasn't chill?

1363
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,960
I thought he was chill.

1364
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,000
Okay, nice ammo.

1365
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,280
Welp, that was two fucking health kits gone.

1366
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:23,940
Whoops.

1367
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,860
That was like a little oopsie.

1368
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,620
I could've stockpiled more heals.

1369
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,230
He gave us no...

1370
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,750
You knew I was gonna poke him.

1371
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,870
He was standing right there.

1372
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:40,410
You knew I wanted to.

1373
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:51,760
Oh, Mr. Save?

1374
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,820
Little girl.

1375
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,740
Don't think I forgot what a little fucking brat you are.

1376
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,540
What does she see in Silent Hill?

1377
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,540
What's like the scariest things for her?

1378
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,360
That's not very nice.

1379
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,620
Didn't your parents teach you any manners?

1380
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,920
What you got there?

1381
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,860
It's normal.

1382
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,640
She sees a nice city.

1383
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,120
Oh my god, you're right.

1384
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:26,840
She has it.

1385
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,320
You didn't love Mary any...

1386
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,680
Oh wait, is she reading my letter?

1387
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,660
How do you know her name?

1388
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,180
Yeah, how does she know?

1389
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,860
Who are you?

1390
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,360
She's not real.

1391
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,900
I knew children weren't real.

1392
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,980
I fucking knew kids weren't real.

1393
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,400
We all came out as adults.

1394
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,980
Wait, there's a save point?

1395
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,040
Where's the save point?

1396
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,820
Where is it?

1397
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,300
Children were...

1398
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:01,760
Oh, there it is.

1399
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,640
Children were invented by the government.

1400
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,940
To make us docile and weak.

1401
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,200
I fucking knew it.

1402
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:14,180
We were all born in those pods.

1403
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,120
We were all pod people.

1404
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,020
Born in a fucking chamber.

1405
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,700
And then let out when we go to college.

1406
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,960
We were all test tube adults.

1407
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,780
I knew they weren't real.

1408
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,360
Just like...

1409
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:37,280
I knew it.

1410
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:43,010
I knew they were built and not born.

1411
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,000
Oh, we're in the garden now.

1412
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:49,680
Where am I?

1413
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,280
Rosewater Park.

1414
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,400
That doesn't sound too bad.

1415
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:57,900
Park doesn't sound bad.

1416
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,120
It sounds pretty nice.

1417
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,940
Man, I wish I had that city mod right now where it looks like a beautiful city.

1418
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:05,700
I...

1419
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:16,720
Imagine if I had that mod that makes everything like actually a city and removes all the fucking fog.

1420
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,480
That'd be a nice experience right about now.

1421
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,480
Oh, hey, more ammo.

1422
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,500
What do you mean, Doki?

1423
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,860
I do see a beautiful city.

1424
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,240
What are you talking about?

1425
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,280
Don't do this to me.

1426
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,020
Mary, could you...

1427
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,490
Patrick, Chester, son of Edward, he fought and...

1428
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,520
Studied for the people.

1429
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,720
Yes, you think he studied for the people?

1430
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:45,100
For liberty and for all of our tomorrows.

1431
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,480
His memory lives on.

1432
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,780
There's more loot.

1433
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,820
Yes, studied.

1434
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,500
What else could it possibly say?

1435
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,880
Like, I don't know where I'm supposed to actually go.

1436
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:12,860
I'm just hoping I grab loot before, like, the actual place.

1437
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:21,480
In memory of the 67 who died of illness and now sleep beneath the lake.

1438
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,140
The fuck happened in the lake?

1439
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:27,260
If I go forward, does this progress the game?

1440
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:32,240
If I go through the... the...

1441
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,840
What's that word called?

1442
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,800
That thing?

1443
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,120
Is this Alan Wake in the lake?

1444
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,780
If I go through this, does it progress?

1445
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:50,810
Yeah, the pier.

1446
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:51,250
The pier.

1447
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:51,750
Oh, okay.

1448
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:56,670
Okay, so I'll just... I wanna make sure I got all the loot first.

1449
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:58,810
Loot time.

1450
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:01,570
What?

1451
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:03,450
How's the gate closed?

1452
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,750
There's nothing locking it.

1453
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:06,270
Okay.

1454
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:09,050
Go this way.

1455
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:17,330
Guy wearing a big metal pyramid and wielding a knife that is big as clouds.

1456
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:18,590
Yeah, he's... I don't know!

1457
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:19,810
He could be a cosplayer!

1458
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,890
Guys, you can't judge a person's cosplay.

1459
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:27,830
New fear unlocked.

1460
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,550
Is he a cosplayer or a murderer?

1461
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:30,850
Or both?

1462
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:31,850
Oh, hey.

1463
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,990
Quite a little... Oh, it's just like... It's... Oh, wait.

1464
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,510
It talks about Silent Hill.

1465
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:40,430
Fill your heart with peace.

1466
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,250
Remorse during your time here will be pleasant and leave you with memories.

1467
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:46,730
Oh yeah, definitely lots of memories.

1468
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,050
He never... Okay, look.

1469
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:56,370
Like, then... Then I... You know, I figured, like, he fixed his issues.

1470
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:58,870
He got less angry.

1471
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,340
On the statue?

1472
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:05,960
Which one?

1473
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,900
There was, like, 200 million statues.

1474
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:19,150
What the fuck?

1475
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,170
Influx, thank you for the super chat!

1476
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,030
Thank you, thank you!

1477
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:28,910
Hey Doki, if I can play, like, a dragon guy first, so can you.

1478
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:33,690
I don't know who... I didn't know anyone going in, but I still got a lot of the story beat.

1479
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:34,550
Thank you for the super chat!

1480
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:35,590
Thank you, thank you!

1481
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,090
Is that the statue?

1482
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:41,970
I'm open to explore it if it's, like, not a super long game.

1483
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,830
But I also have, like, a million other games we need to finish.

1484
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:47,250
The one that looks like a statue?

1485
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:48,890
Okay, well, we're not getting it.

1486
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:52,930
Thank you for the super chat!

1487
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:54,030
Thank you, thank you!

1488
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:56,210
Uh...

1489
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,810
Let's see...

1490
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:05,190
Okay, how important is the loot?

1491
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:10,610
How important is the loot, guys?

1492
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:12,530
Is it the statue?

1493
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:16,510
That's just a fucking statue!

1494
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:25,320
There's... Oh my God, guys, you gotta be...

1495
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,700
You gotta be very specific on which statue it is.

1496
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,280
Because... Because I'm lost.

1497
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,040
Which one?

1498
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,720
They're missing heads!

1499
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,140
There's more than one statue?

1500
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,020
This one?

1501
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,540
It's the guy that said he studied!

1502
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,000
He studied for the people!

1503
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,110
Oh my God.

1504
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:04,650
The other one.

1505
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:05,830
Jesus Christ.

1506
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:10,330
Which... There's so many.

1507
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:14,790
Guys, I think I explored everything around.

1508
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,510
They all have no head!

1509
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:23,850
Guys, where?

1510
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:24,810
Where?

1511
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:28,530
I ran!

1512
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:29,730
How?

1513
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:32,750
How did I run past a fucking statue?

1514
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:37,130
Oh my God.

1515
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:43,610
The headless one between the other headless one and the headless... Oh my fucking God.

1516
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:48,150
Oh my God, how many statues are there?

1517
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:52,530
I don't even... I don't even think there were that many statues!

1518
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:57,130
Oh my God, what do you mean I'm blind?

1519
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:58,170
I don't understand.

1520
01:20:58,450 --> 01:20:59,470
That's just lore.

1521
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,190
That's just lore!

1522
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:07,890
What do you mean it's...

1523
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:16,430
Where have I been?

1524
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:19,990
Okay, I grabbed it there.

1525
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,440
That's where I came in.

1526
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:29,600
Oh my God, whoever's waiting for me at that fucking pier, I'm sorry.

1527
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,900
Whoever's still waiting for me at the... I think I got one guy.

1528
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,620
I think... There's no way.

1529
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:42,700
There's no... I literally ran around this area like 200...

1530
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,880
I got one guy.

1531
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:46,800
There's no way.

1532
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,080
There's no way.

1533
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,980
There was no... There's no statue.

1534
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,600
There's no fucking statue, was there?

1535
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:59,560
There was no loot, was there?

1536
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,020
It was just... Read this.

1537
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,500
There's no way.

1538
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:06,900
There's no way.

1539
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,660
I must have got one guy.

1540
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,260
I literally... I do not see what you see.

1541
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:17,550
I... I do not see... You passed it?!

1542
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,700
Where?!

1543
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:23,680
Oh my God, I swear to God.

1544
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,880
I'm fucking... I'm walking now.

1545
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:27,060
I'm shimmying.

1546
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,240
I'm fucking walking now.

1547
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:37,440
I'm fucking... I'm like literally walking slow.

1548
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,380
Guys, you're wasting your own time.

1549
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,140
I told you.

1550
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,000
I can only handle two hours of Silent Hill.

1551
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,460
This counts in the two hours.

1552
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,400
Guys, I need you guys to know.

1553
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,080
These are the actions of your mistakes, guys.

1554
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,460
This counts in your two hours.

1555
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:56,560
I need you... I need you to know that.

1556
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:03,160
You... you have to remember that this fucking counts.

1557
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,580
So you guys better... better... you guys can continue to fuck with me.

1558
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:10,800
You guys can continue to fuck with me.

1559
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,840
Look up.

1560
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:18,560
What do you mean look up?!

1561
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:24,760
Now fucking do it again.

1562
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,980
Bro, I'm fucking... I'm pressing E.

1563
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,740
I'm literally... I'm literally spamming E at everything.

1564
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,180
You guys are fucking with me.

1565
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,060
There's no way.

1566
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:44,620
There's... there's no... Along the fence?!

1567
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,620
This?!

1568
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,360
There's no fucking way.

1569
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:50,840
There's no fucking way there was anything here.

1570
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,900
I refuse to believe.

1571
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,400
There's no fucking way.

1572
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,360
There's actually no fucking way.

1573
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:01,980
I am not stalling!

1574
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,440
You guys keep telling me I missed the loot!

1575
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,120
Oh my god.

1576
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,180
Oh my god.

1577
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,120
That's it.

1578
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:15,300
I'm turning the car around.

1579
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,420
I'm... just remember this... this counts.

1580
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,760
This counts in your... in your slotted two hours.

1581
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,420
This fucking...

1582
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:29,460
This... remember what they took from you because I...

1583
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,820
They took this... remember what they took from you.

1584
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:46,430
Some of us are innocent.

1585
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:51,770
No, you didn't stop the... you didn't stop the guilty one.

1586
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:57,510
If they were innocent, you would have stopped them.

1587
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,530
Now, you all get punished together.

1588
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,450
Wait, she's not?

1589
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:06,670
She's Maria, but what if she was bad?

1590
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,100
Woah!

1591
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:27,600
Woah!

1592
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:28,200
Woah!

1593
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:28,660
Woah!

1594
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:32,340
This body is reserved for my fucking dead wife.

1595
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,140
No touchy.

1596
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:51,480
Yeah, it's been a very long three years, man.

1597
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:58,540
She can't... she can't be dead.

1598
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:59,880
I stopped taking my meds.

1599
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,100
I can still hear her.

1600
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,580
Our special place?

1601
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,900
Is this our special place?

1602
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,300
Our only special place?

1603
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:37,490
I, uh... I don't know anymore.

1604
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:43,300
There was... something.

1605
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,580
I just... I can't quite...

1606
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:47,540
Hey!

1607
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,380
Like I don't know.

1608
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,860
I mean, there's this one place.

1609
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:55,820
Not far from here.

1610
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,860
What kind of place?

1611
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:05,260
The kind two lovers might call special.

1612
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,640
Wait, it's her special place?

1613
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,460
Unless you have somewhere else to be.

1614
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,180
Woah!

1615
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:20,160
Be gone, woman!

1616
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,880
You seductress!

1617
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,380
I'm just messing with you.

1618
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,440
This body is for God and my dead wife.

1619
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,320
It's this way.

1620
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,160
Then she tried to touch me.

1621
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,660
I gotta go to HR now.

1622
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,320
Be gone, temptress.

1623
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:43,740
I've been... he's been holding it in for three years.

1624
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,600
One touch is gonna set him off.

1625
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,300
I'm sorry.

1626
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:49,800
I'm sorry.

1627
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,300
Um, past tense?

1628
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,620
I love her.

1629
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,540
She's alive, goddammit.

1630
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:15,860
How dare you give me the past tense of love?

1631
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,560
She's still there.

1632
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:26,080
My dead wife is alive.

1633
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,710
What is this BGM?

1634
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:34,750
This is such a fucking weird BGM.

1635
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:49,900
Like, I'm like, what is this BGM that we're listening to?

1636
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,200
What the fuck?

1637
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:52,400
Did she just shake her?

1638
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:53,260
Woah!

1639
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:55,640
Woah!

1640
01:28:58,540 --> 01:28:59,940
Maria, I'm sorry.

1641
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,620
Maria, I'm sorry, Maria.

1642
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,860
But like, I'm sorry, Maria.

1643
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,060
But like, I'm sorry.

1644
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,840
But like...

1645
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,280
Woah!

1646
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,620
Woah, give me a sec.

1647
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:21,680
Let me calm down.

1648
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,480
Gotta get some composure.

1649
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,440
Gotta look in the sky and think of God.

1650
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:39,440
If I look in the sky, I won't be tempted.

1651
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,200
Don't tempt me.

1652
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,040
Can I just shoot her?

1653
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:49,840
No, I can't.

1654
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,140
Okay.

1655
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:53,820
Doc, thank you for the super chat.

1656
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:54,820
Thank you, thank you.

1657
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,300
Just asked her to dress up like your dead wife.

1658
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,620
Problem solved.

1659
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,120
Not fucking weird at all.

1660
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:02,800
What does she see?

1661
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,120
Wait, she's in my mind, so she doesn't see shit.

1662
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,040
Right?

1663
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:13,170
Okay.

1664
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:14,350
Yeah, this was locked before.

1665
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,250
Did she die?

1666
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:21,090
Guys?

1667
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:24,910
Okay, before we move on, can she die?

1668
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:28,790
I need to know.

1669
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:32,490
Yes?

1670
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,360
Oh God, okay.

1671
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:41,120
Okay.

1672
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,220
It's an escort mission.

1673
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:44,280
Okay, here we go.

1674
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:50,380
Okay, here we go.

1675
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:51,940
It's time.

1676
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:56,820
Oh no, it's fucking time.

1677
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,640
Okay, it's time.

1678
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:00,560
It's time.

1679
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:02,320
Oh my God.

1680
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,680
It's...

1681
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,000
Oh hey.

1682
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,460
So far from home.

1683
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,540
Alright, now we know.

1684
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:20,560
Now we know that we gotta escort her.

1685
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:21,480
Oh, nice.

1686
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,340
Bullets.

1687
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,100
I love me some bullets.

1688
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,420
We're gonna be using a lot of that.

1689
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,140
Okay, I'm gonna make sure I got all the loot.

1690
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:34,620
I assume we have to go up from here, right?

1691
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:41,140
Alright,

1692
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,100
oh my God.

1693
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,340
Oh my God, why?

1694
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:47,140
Why?

1695
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:50,000
Why did they give me an escort mission?

1696
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:53,260
I'm already going through so much.

1697
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:54,340
I'm...

1698
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,340
Oh my God.

1699
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:58,180
Oh my God.

1700
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:03,340
The spirit is loyal but the flesh...

1701
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,420
Oh no.

1702
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,760
I thought... me loves she.

1703
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:16,680
Why do I have to do this again?

1704
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:20,320
The worst part is I can't make her just be like, sit.

1705
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,080
Just stay.

1706
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:23,300
Stay.

1707
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,320
Don't do anything.

1708
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,420
Can I go to the ladies room?

1709
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,080
Oh hey, nice.

1710
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:37,740
Alright.

1711
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:39,940
Okay, nice.

1712
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:40,900
I got some meds.

1713
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,340
Oh my God.

1714
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,220
Okay, here we go.

1715
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,260
Here we go.

1716
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:46,860
We're off.

1717
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,640
Come on, Ashley.

1718
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,320
I mean, hot Maria.

1719
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:52,780
Hotter Maria.

1720
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,120
Maria, if she let me...

1721
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:05,440
Maria, if she, you know, does what I want for my birthday.

1722
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:12,380
If she lets me actually pick my birthday present.

1723
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:13,400
I know.

1724
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:18,210
Okay.

1725
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:20,570
Let's see.

1726
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:28,110
Alright.

1727
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,090
Where do we go?

1728
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:34,310
Do we go to Jack's Inn?

1729
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:40,090
You know what would have been better?

1730
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:44,070
If she puts on the... if she puts on the hat.

1731
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:52,790
Maria, why won't you put on the dog hat?

1732
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:55,790
I thought we were both gonna get freaky.

1733
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:02,250
Alright.

1734
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:09,370
Everything would have been perfect if she also puts on the hat.

1735
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:12,290
It's like you froze for a second.

1736
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:16,810
Where the fuck do I go?

1737
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:18,650
I guess I go up here?

1738
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,490
Almost perfect.

1739
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,350
Oh, I can.

1740
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:26,110
I was gonna say.

1741
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:30,430
I wonder if I can break into the ones that are... Oh, nice.

1742
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:32,810
The ones that don't have the red card.

1743
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:38,420
Oh my God, look at all these meds.

1744
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:41,140
Look at all... Oh.

1745
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,360
See, it's... Guys, guys.

1746
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,840
I'm not cheating on my dead wife, guys.

1747
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,640
It's two separate beds.

1748
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:56,460
It's... I would never do that to her.

1749
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,660
It's two separate beds, guys.

1750
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,420
There's two beds.

1751
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:02,740
How dare you say that?

1752
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:04,700
I am loyal.

1753
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,160
I'm so goddamn loyal.

1754
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,740
Oh, wait.

1755
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,040
Let me see this.

1756
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,960
I'm fixing the pipes at 107.

1757
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:21,020
Okay.

1758
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,980
Oh, there's a pin.

1759
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:31,070
Okay, we gotta figure out the pin for this.

1760
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:39,550
We could figure out the pin for this, or...

1761
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:46,070
Or...

1762
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:47,930
Guys.

1763
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:51,870
Or...

1764
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:54,490
iPad, thank you for the super chat.

1765
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:55,890
Thank you, thank you.

1766
01:36:00,850 --> 01:36:01,890
Oh, thank you.

1767
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,050
Oh, shit!

1768
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,290
Oh, shit!

1769
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:08,690
Okay!

1770
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:10,890
Okay.

1771
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,270
Oh, shit.

1772
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:15,210
Okay, we're fine.

1773
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:20,310
No shot.

1774
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:26,310
iPad, thank you for the super chat.

1775
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:27,310
Thank you, thank you.

1776
01:36:27,630 --> 01:36:29,690
Don't let that Harlan Murray distract you.

1777
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:33,150
Mary's phone is all the material you need.

1778
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:35,810
Jesus.

1779
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:37,170
I can't!

1780
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:39,590
Guys!

1781
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:42,170
I can't!

1782
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:43,630
We can't!

1783
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:46,330
We can't just only look at her photo!

1784
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:50,670
What?

1785
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:51,530
There's nothing here.

1786
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:53,990
I see nothing.

1787
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:01,430
Wow, what a lucky guess, guys.

1788
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:03,010
So lucky.

1789
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:07,830
Nice meds.

1790
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,560
What's that?

1791
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,280
What's going on out there?

1792
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:18,680
Wait, did I use up all- Oh, I was gonna say, like, what?

1793
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:21,480
What's this?

1794
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:28,780
1, 1 less, 3, 1 more, 8, 3 less, 0, 1 more.

1795
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,360
Oh, this was- This was 0, 4, 5, 1.

1796
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,220
I'm so fucking smart.

1797
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,020
Look at that.

1798
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,200
Oh, shit.

1799
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:47,900
What the fuck?

1800
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,920
That's a- That's dead woman's clothes.

1801
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,580
I mean, I'm used to that, but like-

1802
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,460
She gonna put it on?

1803
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,040
What's she gonna do with it?

1804
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,180
Is she just gonna look at it?

1805
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,020
We have places to be.

1806
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,600
Oh, is that the OG outfit?

1807
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,540
Wait, that is?

1808
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,380
Oh, the door- You can open the door.

1809
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,260
Wait, I wanna see it again.

1810
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,740
Wait, which one- Oh, that one?

1811
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:17,620
That was the OG outfit?

1812
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,640
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

1813
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:24,800
Oh, that's cute.

1814
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,300
Oh, that's a cute easter egg.

1815
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:28,940
Alright.

1816
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,340
Save.

1817
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:43,160
Guys, I know we have the photo of Mary, but like- Guys, please, it's been three- Guys, please, it's been three years.

1818
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:45,440
How much longer must I wait?

1819
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:53,800
Okay.

1820
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:59,600
Okay, what the fuck do I- What do I do with this key?

1821
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:08,220
What do I do with this key?

1822
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,740
I don't even remember what key I got.

1823
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,560
Uh, equipment.

1824
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:16,960
Is it here?

1825
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:17,340
No.

1826
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,300
No, this hardly belongs to the streets.

1827
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,320
Oh, the gate key.

1828
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:25,140
It's like right here.

1829
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:34,060
If you let Maria die, she'll have more income.

1830
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:38,680
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

1831
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:39,900
Thank you, thank you.

1832
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:42,980
Papa Samir, thank you for the super chat.

1833
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,080
Thank you, thank you.

1834
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,360
Is it down this way?

1835
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,040
Which way?

1836
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:55,600
You can't just say- There's two ways.

1837
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,320
There's two ways.

1838
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:00,480
Okay, assume it's this way.

1839
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,220
Okay, Maria.

1840
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:10,720
Now that we're in an intersection, which one is down?

1841
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,460
Where are you trying to take me?

1842
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,500
Left or right, Maria?

1843
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:22,560
You can't say it's down this way and then we're in a fucking- Do we have a left or right?

1844
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,200
Like,

1845
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,820
where do you wanna go?

1846
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:36,980
I'm just gonna go this way just to see if there's like- Okay, okay.

1847
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:37,680
Oh, you know what?

1848
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,760
You could've told me it's not this way.

1849
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:40,300
You could've fucking told me.

1850
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,860
Yeah, you could've told me it's a dead end.

1851
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:52,040
Please.

1852
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,120
Please don't remind me.

1853
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:01,260
Aww.

1854
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:01,700
Aww.

1855
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,760
That's so sweet.

1856
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:10,900
Wow!

1857
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,120
You harlot.

1858
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,960
You fucking harlot.

1859
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:14,760
I knew it.

1860
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:16,020
Hellfire.

1861
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:18,880
Why are you getting close?

1862
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:19,620
Don't touch me.

1863
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,200
Don't touch me.

1864
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:25,380
Oh my god, not in front of my dead wife.

1865
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,120
That witch.

1866
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:33,540
I fucking knew it.

1867
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:35,860
You can't trust no woman.

1868
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,200
It's a witch.

1869
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:41,980
We gotta set her on fire.

1870
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,740
Oh my god.

1871
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,900
I can't believe it.

1872
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,960
I am strong.

1873
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:53,720
My will is strong.

1874
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:58,720
My will is strong.

1875
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,900
I'll never betray her.

1876
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,520
But like, okay, but she is here.

1877
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:10,360
She is here and my dead wife is not here.

1878
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,380
So, oh my gosh.

1879
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:19,500
Guys, the longer we're here together, the harder this is gonna make it.

1880
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,840
Let's see.

1881
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:30,400
Be strong.

1882
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:34,260
Be strong.

1883
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:43,220
What?

1884
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:43,400
What?

1885
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,700
The fucking empty cat?

1886
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:49,060
Whoa, the plot holes got crazy in Silent Hill.

1887
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,080
Come on.

1888
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:14,850
Are you serious?

1889
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:21,130
Are you- Aww, and I have to kill all of them because I need to- Oh no, I don't.

1890
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:21,570
Just go.

1891
01:43:23,690 --> 01:43:24,370
Leave.

1892
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:27,530
They can't- What are they gonna do?

1893
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:28,950
Open the gates?

1894
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:30,590
They don't have thumbs.

1895
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:34,210
Wait, that's my stick.

1896
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:36,050
That's my hurdy stick.

1897
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:40,530
Oh, I don't need a hurdy stick no more.

1898
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:43,010
I got the hurdy pole.

1899
01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:47,250
It's upgraded.

1900
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:56,400
Oh shit!

1901
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,180
That was a bad idea.

1902
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:02,700
What the fuck are you- I said stay close, not go towards the bombing.

1903
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:09,620
That is the opposite of close.

1904
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:12,360
Where am I supposed to go?

1905
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,200
Oh god.

1906
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:21,560
Okay, this is not good.

1907
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,040
What is this?

1908
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,060
Alright, this is not good.

1909
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,420
They have high heals now.

1910
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:36,400
This is not good.

1911
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:39,300
They have high heals, guys.

1912
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,780
It's not looking so good.

1913
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,540
They're wearing heals.

1914
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,060
Oh no.

1915
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:48,180
Oh no, it's getting worse.

1916
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:50,540
It's getting worse!

1917
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,060
They're wearing heals now!

1918
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,840
Now it's gonna accentuate their legs!

1919
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:58,220
No!

1920
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,080
Now they look even better.

1921
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:06,460
Oh no, they're hotter now.

1922
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:12,120
What the fuck?

1923
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:13,940
Okay, goodbye.

1924
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:15,800
Goodbye.

1925
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:23,120
Yeah, it's bad because- Oh my god, it makes their legs look so cool.

1926
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,120
What the fuck?

1927
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:24,640
What?

1928
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:28,880
Why?

1929
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:34,580
Why are you still there?

1930
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:39,360
Okay.

1931
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:44,120
Wait, ammo was missed?

1932
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:44,560
Where?

1933
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:47,780
Sorry, I had to go back.

1934
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:50,740
And I missed some ammo.

1935
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:52,780
Not there.

1936
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:54,220
Oh, there!

1937
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,120
Nice, alright.

1938
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:57,400
Sorry, man.

1939
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,220
This was very, very important.

1940
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:02,360
One guy was just walking around.

1941
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:03,860
Just vibing.

1942
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:06,640
You know what?

1943
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,780
I feel- Oh my god, wait, she's wearing a thong!

1944
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,920
Wait, he's wearing a thong!

1945
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:12,360
Wait, no!

1946
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:13,440
No, it's just their skin.

1947
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:13,820
Okay.

1948
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:15,980
God, I'm a fucking mess.

1949
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:19,840
I'm a little bit freaky right now.

1950
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:22,840
What's over there on the side?

1951
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:32,130
Oh, he doesn't know.

1952
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:35,570
That's right.

1953
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:36,310
You know what?

1954
01:46:36,450 --> 01:46:36,810
Fuck it.

1955
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:40,270
I figured I have enough ammo for it.

1956
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:42,270
I have enough.

1957
01:46:44,950 --> 01:46:46,150
That's fucking right.

1958
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:46,870
Yeah, that's right.

1959
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:47,330
Yeah!

1960
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:49,410
Get predicted!

1961
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:53,050
I know your patterns now!

1962
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:57,710
Wait, I actually know all their patterns.

1963
01:46:58,350 --> 01:46:59,090
Wait, this is easy.

1964
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:06,490
What's that sound?

1965
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:09,070
Oh god!

1966
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:13,230
Oh, that's- You fucking gamers don't look down!

1967
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:14,710
I look down!

1968
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:16,290
Okay.

1969
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:22,270
I'm like confused on- Wait, what the fuck?

1970
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:23,470
Get out!

1971
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:24,310
Get out!

1972
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:26,630
Oh, shit!

1973
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:29,210
Oh!

1974
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:29,770
Oh!

1975
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:30,730
Oh!

1976
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:32,170
Oh my god!

1977
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:34,530
I didn't realize they still existed.

1978
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:36,630
I thought they were gone!

1979
01:47:37,370 --> 01:47:38,690
Okay, that was my bad.

1980
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:41,710
I legitimately forgot these things existed in the world.

1981
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:43,550
I was like, you're not indoors?

1982
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:45,650
What are you doing here?

1983
01:47:47,650 --> 01:47:49,850
You're supposed to be an indoor monster!

1984
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:53,050
Like how cats are supposed to be indoors!

1985
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:57,210
Okay.

1986
01:47:58,650 --> 01:47:59,170
Okay.

1987
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:03,930
What the fuck are you doing?

1988
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:09,130
Okay.

1989
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:09,970
My bad.

1990
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,190
That's my bad.

1991
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:16,150
Alright.

1992
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:19,110
Are you ready?

1993
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:19,790
Are we here?

1994
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:21,230
Wait, there's more?

1995
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:24,270
Oh my god, that's a dead end?

1996
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:25,650
What's the point?

1997
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:31,570
Oh, here.

1998
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:34,150
Okay, I was like, what the fuck was the point?

1999
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:41,520
Is there any sneaky guy?

2000
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,540
Anybody trying to sneak around?

2001
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,520
Where did she go?

2002
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:50,520
I think Maria said over there.

2003
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:52,760
Wait, where are you going?

2004
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,360
Maria, you are not supposed to run off on fire.

2005
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:58,340
You are not- Oh my god, Maria, please.

2006
01:48:58,660 --> 01:48:59,620
Wait, where did she go?

2007
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:01,940
Maria, please!

2008
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:03,000
This is your fault!

2009
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:03,540
Maria!

2010
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,560
Please!

2011
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:08,800
Oh my god.

2012
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,160
Oh my god!

2013
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:13,060
Maria, this is silly!

2014
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:15,080
Oh my god!

2015
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:15,980
Please!

2016
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,840
Where did she go?

2017
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:25,100
I'm so fucking mad now.

2018
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:28,780
Maria, you fucking bitch!

2019
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:38,420
You made me- Oh my god, I was trying to- Maria, why is she there?

2020
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:41,320
I wasted so many heals.

2021
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:48,820
Oh my god, why is she- But she aggroed everybody too!

2022
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:51,540
You're such a bitch!

2023
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:53,040
I can say that.

2024
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,380
I can say that because she was.

2025
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:57,220
She did not have to do that.

2026
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,380
She did not have to fucking do that.

2027
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:04,220
I'm so mad.

2028
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:07,800
She actually aggroed everybody over.

2029
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,560
We could've just walked over.

2030
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:15,000
Oh my god.

2031
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:18,100
I freaked out because I was like, am I supposed to protect her?

2032
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,780
And then they all turned around for me!

2033
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:39,820
If I could kick you out of the party, I would.

2034
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:44,580
You weren't so hot right now.

2035
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:45,720
Oh my god, of course.

2036
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:51,940
Guess where this key was.

2037
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:55,960
Oh, she knows.

2038
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:02,560
You know what?

2039
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:03,340
All is forgiven.

2040
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,220
I don't know why, but I just somehow felt like I should forgive you right now.

2041
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:11,380
There's just something about you that made me so forgiving.

2042
01:51:20,150 --> 01:51:21,390
That easy?

2043
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:23,910
James has been like...

2044
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:25,050
It's been three years.

2045
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:26,870
Cut James some slack, guys.

2046
01:51:27,190 --> 01:51:30,810
It's been three years for this poor man.

2047
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:41,000
I like how there's red solo cups.

2048
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:51,810
Oh, ammo.

2049
01:51:52,050 --> 01:51:52,370
Nice.

2050
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:56,130
Oh, thank god there's ammo.

2051
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:56,290
Where'd you go?

2052
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:00,660
Maria?

2053
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,540
Where did you go?

2054
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:02,840
Hello?

2055
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:05,880
Where'd you go?

2056
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,600
Wait, what?

2057
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:10,720
What the fuck?

2058
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:13,080
What was that?

2059
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:22,060
I missed a picture?

2060
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:24,160
Okay.

2061
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,700
There's a lot of stuff I missed.

2062
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:28,680
Ammo, nice.

2063
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,320
There was a mirror?

2064
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:36,200
Oh, there was.

2065
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:38,340
Oh, there it is.

2066
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:41,500
Oh my god, is she gonna...

2067
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,200
Ready to kill it.

2068
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,160
Oh my god.

2069
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:46,360
Oh my god.

2070
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,100
No, it is.

2071
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:48,980
It's a strip club.

2072
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,740
It's Heaven's Next.

2073
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:56,920
Wait, is it Heaven's Exit or Heaven's Night?

2074
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:58,300
Alright, let's go.

2075
01:52:59,220 --> 01:52:59,640
Alright.

2076
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:00,020
Alright.

2077
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:03,220
It's time to fuck y'all.

2078
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,360
There's the private rooms.

2079
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,160
Alright.

2080
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:08,740
Maria, I'm sorry.

2081
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:10,580
Maria, just...

2082
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:12,860
Maria, just remember...

2083
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:15,620
Maria, three years.

2084
01:53:15,820 --> 01:53:18,100
I made it past three years, Maria.

2085
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:19,640
I just need you to know that.

2086
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:26,100
I made it three years, Maria.

2087
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:27,600
I've tried so hard.

2088
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,880
Stay strong.

2089
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:40,780
Maria, please, you can't...

2090
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:42,280
You can't be mad at me, Maria.

2091
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:45,160
Maria, please, she's just like you.

2092
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:52,240
What?

2093
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,560
It's almost November, guys.

2094
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:02,320
It's not November yet!

2095
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:06,240
It's not November yet!

2096
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,240
Fucking shut up.

2097
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:33,920
There's dead monsters outside!

2098
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:39,200
Mary could be out there.

2099
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:49,600
My dead wife could be out there right now, walking around, very much alive.

2100
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:55,260
No, it's my fault.

2101
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:57,160
No, you're right.

2102
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,160
It is my fault.

2103
01:54:58,300 --> 01:55:01,040
That time when you aggroed them, I'm still feeling that pain.

2104
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:04,520
I guess this place is getting to me, too.

2105
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:15,720
Am I crazy?

2106
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,660
Am I crazy?

2107
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:29,560
James, you should have asked that a long time ago.

2108
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:35,380
I can think of another.

2109
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:39,380
What's that?

2110
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:46,490
Possibly... There's no... There's no, James.

2111
01:55:46,930 --> 01:55:49,670
No, you're perfectly normal.

2112
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:55,430
Oh no, he's becoming self-aware, chat.

2113
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:01,990
Oh, hey.

2114
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:06,730
You're right.

2115
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:11,850
If I drink more alcohol, I won't see them as... Oh, I'll see them as even hotter.

2116
01:56:28,730 --> 01:56:29,230
Cheers!

2117
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:32,510
Beer o'clock!

2118
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:37,370
Guys, I'm getting tempted.

2119
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:38,070
What do I do?

2120
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:41,890
And it's working.

2121
01:56:42,050 --> 01:56:43,290
What do I do, guys?

2122
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:56,250
Guys, I don't know how much longer I can stay strong, guys.

2123
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,400
Did I not drink it?

2124
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,680
Wait, did I not drink it?

2125
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:13,140
What the fuck happened in that cutscene?

2126
01:57:18,350 --> 01:57:19,510
Lost and found.

2127
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:22,730
What the fuck happened in there?

2128
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:25,630
See, look, guys.

2129
01:57:25,730 --> 01:57:28,630
I didn't... I'm stronger than she thinks.

2130
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:31,610
Guys, look at that.

2131
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:33,090
I'll never betray her.

2132
01:57:34,390 --> 01:57:35,410
See, guys?

2133
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:37,290
I didn't... I didn't fuck up.

2134
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:38,930
Whoa.

2135
01:57:39,910 --> 01:57:42,010
I mean... Yeah?

2136
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:45,370
You like that, guys?

2137
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:46,910
Magic Mike right now?

2138
01:57:48,490 --> 01:57:50,510
What's your wife going to do?

2139
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:51,730
Haunt you?

2140
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:56,570
I think... I think she's doing that right now.

2141
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:05,110
Alright, we gotta go follow her?

2142
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:08,930
Wait, what?

2143
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:11,030
This is like a safe place?

2144
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:14,790
Am I missing anything in my safe spot?

2145
01:58:16,190 --> 01:58:17,730
Wait, that's where the...

2146
01:58:17,730 --> 01:58:20,830
Oh, there it is.

2147
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:21,790
That's... Yeah, there it is.

2148
01:58:21,890 --> 01:58:23,590
I was like, where the fuck is the save?

2149
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:27,780
Okay.

2150
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:30,880
Oh.

2151
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:34,080
Anything... Oh!

2152
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:40,220
Oh my god, they're showing all the parts.

2153
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,120
My god, where are you?

2154
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,200
Oh my gosh.

2155
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:45,140
Oh my gosh.

2156
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:45,820
Okay, I'm ready.

2157
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:46,900
I'm ready.

2158
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:47,720
I'm strong.

2159
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:48,600
Come on.

2160
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:49,960
Don't be tempted.

2161
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:51,180
I'm strong.

2162
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:56,320
In the booth?

2163
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:01,570
There's a booth?

2164
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:03,550
There's a booth seat?

2165
01:59:04,850 --> 01:59:06,010
Remember when I said I was ready?

2166
01:59:06,190 --> 01:59:07,350
Sorry, I gotta look for items.

2167
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:08,370
Oh, there it is!

2168
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:10,550
Oh my god.

2169
01:59:13,610 --> 01:59:16,650
Is this what you wanted me to see, guys?

2170
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:17,870
Are you satisfied?

2171
01:59:17,870 --> 01:59:20,190
Guys, please.

2172
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:21,970
I'm strong.

2173
01:59:22,450 --> 01:59:23,930
I'm strong.

2174
01:59:30,670 --> 01:59:32,330
I am strong.

2175
01:59:35,130 --> 01:59:40,070
Oh my god.

2176
01:59:40,230 --> 01:59:41,810
Somebody left their shoes.

2177
01:59:42,590 --> 01:59:48,450
I can come back to it.

2178
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:51,370
Put it on.

2179
01:59:52,170 --> 01:59:53,730
There's a bar item?

2180
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:57,570
There is?

2181
01:59:59,330 --> 02:00:02,190
Guys, guys, remember, this counts in your two hours, guys.

2182
02:00:06,730 --> 02:00:11,050
Guys, remember, this counts in the two hour limit.

2183
02:00:15,330 --> 02:00:17,270
Alright, back at it again.

2184
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:19,770
Back at it again.

2185
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:22,450
Yo, it's that statue item from before!

2186
02:00:27,610 --> 02:00:29,010
There we are, it goes in.

2187
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:32,970
Oh, it's the hospital, isn't it?

2188
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:34,130
I see the hospital.

2189
02:00:35,210 --> 02:00:37,050
Oh, I see the hospital.

2190
02:00:37,390 --> 02:00:39,130
I see it, guys.

2191
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:41,510
I see it.

2192
02:00:48,210 --> 02:00:50,850
Oh, if it's not through here, where is it through?

2193
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:02,340
Oh, I have to go through this way.

2194
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:07,140
Oh my god.

2195
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:08,320
Okay.

2196
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:18,260
Look, I am desperate for ammo, ma'am.

2197
02:01:21,980 --> 02:01:23,460
Who's gonna care?

2198
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:25,080
These cars are abandoned!

2199
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:33,720
I wanna make sure all the cars are fucked up.

2200
02:01:37,130 --> 02:01:38,130
Okay, nothing.

2201
02:01:38,430 --> 02:01:38,670
Okay.

2202
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:40,450
Wait, where does this go?

2203
02:01:44,050 --> 02:01:46,290
Alright, we'll see now.

2204
02:01:47,430 --> 02:01:48,530
Okay, nothing.

2205
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:51,910
Oh my god.

2206
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:54,970
Guys, I'm so bad with maps, guys.

2207
02:01:56,670 --> 02:02:02,830
Is it obvious that I'm bad at reading maps?

2208
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:05,090
Does it seem that obvious, guys?

2209
02:02:06,230 --> 02:02:06,930
What?

2210
02:02:09,210 --> 02:02:10,290
Where?

2211
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:13,230
Where?

2212
02:02:14,810 --> 02:02:16,610
You mean this fucking bug?

2213
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:21,530
Okay.

2214
02:02:27,610 --> 02:02:30,170
Where the fuck do I go?

2215
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:37,060
The fuck?

2216
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,760
Oh, here.

2217
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:41,260
No.

2218
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,860
Oh my god.

2219
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:53,070
Maria, where?

2220
02:02:54,510 --> 02:02:56,010
Maria, where?

2221
02:02:56,010 --> 02:02:57,290
Where?

2222
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:01,950
Maria, please.

2223
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:03,790
Where do I go?

2224
02:03:04,130 --> 02:03:08,690
I'm so fucking... I'm so confused.

2225
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:10,210
Here?

2226
02:03:10,990 --> 02:03:12,570
Maria, please!

2227
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:16,290
You know where to go!

2228
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:23,280
The garden?

2229
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:27,880
Oh my god, it was the fucking garden.

2230
02:03:36,190 --> 02:03:42,750
Look, Maria said she knows where it is, but she has not been leading me anywhere.

2231
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:45,350
That's all I'm saying.

2232
02:03:46,330 --> 02:03:48,710
I've been trying to figure this out on my own.

2233
02:03:51,110 --> 02:03:55,650
Sorry, Maria, can you please tell me where?

2234
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:06,470
Maria, please, I would really like to know where the garden is.

2235
02:04:06,630 --> 02:04:09,090
If you could please tell me where it is.

2236
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:21,020
Oh my god, I'm just walking.

2237
02:04:39,170 --> 02:04:42,190
Oh, is that Eve?

2238
02:04:45,090 --> 02:04:46,450
A story told around these parts.

2239
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:48,550
Kind of a local legend.

2240
02:04:50,570 --> 02:04:52,670
Tells of a woman who was cast out.

2241
02:04:54,130 --> 02:04:57,390
Sentenced to die on an island out on the lake.

2242
02:05:00,650 --> 02:05:05,810
There was a man in town who fell madly in love with her.

2243
02:05:07,090 --> 02:05:10,370
Every night, he would sneak out.

2244
02:05:11,630 --> 02:05:16,610
Row across the lake, bringing her food and company.

2245
02:05:19,130 --> 02:05:20,050
That's nice.

2246
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:21,310
That's romantic.

2247
02:05:21,630 --> 02:05:27,290
Every night, he would stand there on the shore, holding a lit candle to help him find his way.

2248
02:05:29,690 --> 02:05:33,510
But this one night, a terrible storm...

2249
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:34,490
Why don't they just leave?

2250
02:05:34,670 --> 02:05:38,010
Caught him out in the open, and it blew out the candle.

2251
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:39,010
No!

2252
02:05:39,870 --> 02:05:40,470
So he couldn't...

2253
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:43,070
Even in darkness, the man would not give up.

2254
02:05:43,070 --> 02:05:44,570
He, like, got lost.

2255
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:45,390
And the moon turned back.

2256
02:05:47,190 --> 02:05:51,110
So he fought against the raging waters until finally the lake took him.

2257
02:05:53,150 --> 02:05:54,610
But that's just a local legend.

2258
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:55,510
It's not true, right?

2259
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:56,910
The woman never lost hope.

2260
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:00,170
She kept coming out at night.

2261
02:06:01,390 --> 02:06:02,830
Kept lighting the candle.

2262
02:06:03,850 --> 02:06:05,710
To bring her beloved home.

2263
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:09,390
Okay, at that point, you know he's dead.

2264
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,860
Not sure how much truth there is to it.

2265
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:16,660
It's probably just a fairy tale.

2266
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:20,280
Some say he's still rowing to this very day.

2267
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:21,940
But she's become something of a local saint.

2268
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:25,020
Patron of undying love.

2269
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:28,100
Hence this place.

2270
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:33,460
She's not here.

2271
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:35,700
What?

2272
02:06:38,750 --> 02:06:40,070
She's not here.

2273
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:43,930
Oh, now she realized he was delusional.

2274
02:06:53,450 --> 02:06:54,910
This was a mistake.

2275
02:06:56,130 --> 02:06:57,630
I shouldn't have come here.

2276
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:03,840
Oh, whoa!

2277
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,560
Oh my god, she knows.

2278
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:08,440
She knows I'm vulnerable right now.

2279
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:10,440
There's plenty of other places to look.

2280
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:11,380
You witch.

2281
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:17,240
Whoa.

2282
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:24,300
Whoa.

2283
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:30,060
She knows.

2284
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,860
She knows I'm vulnerable right now.

2285
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,500
I'm trying to find my special place.

2286
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:40,740
Don't let your guard down, Doki.

2287
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:40,880
Doki.

2288
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:44,600
Doki, no!

2289
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,560
You're letting your guard down!

2290
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:55,960
Oh shit, am I supposed to go up here?

2291
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:03,250
Just break up- break all the glasses.

2292
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:03,470
Glasses.

2293
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:16,880
She only likes me because of my mask.

2294
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:25,790
Oh shit.

2295
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:27,890
Oh thank god, escort mission over.

2296
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:33,240
Wait, Eddie?

2297
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:39,000
Wait, they're alive!

2298
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:47,800
Wait, they're both alive!

2299
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:48,080
They're alive.

2300
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:53,140
Okay, I just wanted to be sure.

2301
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:01,340
Hello?

2302
02:09:03,020 --> 02:09:04,020
Hey guys!

2303
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:18,970
What movie are you guys watching?

2304
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:22,990
Wait, in Silent Hill, do the movies change as well?

2305
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:29,010
The fuck happened to- oh, it's ice cream.

2306
02:09:30,150 --> 02:09:32,090
Oh, are you eating your feelings out, bro?

2307
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:33,630
You okay?

2308
02:09:37,550 --> 02:09:39,410
How have you forgotten about me?

2309
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:44,270
Oh my god, James.

2310
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:47,570
James, you- Eddie, you okay, buddy?

2311
02:09:48,970 --> 02:09:50,270
I don't think she's okay.

2312
02:09:55,770 --> 02:09:56,310
Hey,

2313
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:04,120
ice cream can ex- ice cream can expire.

2314
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:06,320
Wait, the freezer still works here?

2315
02:10:09,470 --> 02:10:12,690
Oh, and he wipes it off his shirt!

2316
02:10:13,210 --> 02:10:15,150
That's how you get ants!

2317
02:10:15,470 --> 02:10:17,170
That's how you get ants!

2318
02:10:27,810 --> 02:10:31,150
The freezer works in Silent Hill.

2319
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:37,380
Why'd you look for the little girl?

2320
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:46,840
Oh...

2321
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:50,300
Oh, damn.

2322
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:56,480
Damn, that's karma, James.

2323
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:00,520
You let a woman follow you, but not Eddie.

2324
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:02,360
Bro, what happened, man?

2325
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:06,220
He seems like a bro, bro.

2326
02:11:15,260 --> 02:11:16,300
Is she up there?

2327
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:21,250
Oh...

2328
02:11:23,830 --> 02:11:26,210
Oh, I don't like this.

2329
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:32,670
Back at it again, but we're in a movie theater.

2330
02:11:36,030 --> 02:11:39,350
Okay, alright, up we go.

2331
02:11:39,630 --> 02:11:40,850
Up we go.

2332
02:11:42,510 --> 02:11:43,930
Up we go.

2333
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:45,430
Hello?

2334
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:48,030
Little girl?

2335
02:11:49,450 --> 02:11:51,230
Are you here, little girl?

2336
02:11:52,050 --> 02:11:52,530
Little girl?

2337
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:57,940
I don't think she's here, guys.

2338
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,920
Oh my god, that's an old projector.

2339
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:06,360
Little girl?

2340
02:12:07,860 --> 02:12:08,820
Little girl?

2341
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:14,620
What the fu- I'm angry!

2342
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:19,740
Where do I go?

2343
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:21,540
I'm angry, but I don't know where to go.

2344
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:21,800
Oh, there.

2345
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:26,420
I'm angry and lost!

2346
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:36,840
Oh, there she is.

2347
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:39,820
Why the fuck are you running away?

2348
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:49,240
Like, you were okay hanging out with Eddie, and I look much more approachable than Eddie.

2349
02:12:50,580 --> 02:12:53,080
Like, I'm not eating my feelings out right now.

2350
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:53,920
Not today.

2351
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:56,100
I did yesterday, but not today!

2352
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:02,080
Okay.

2353
02:13:03,820 --> 02:13:04,860
A stranger?

2354
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:08,880
Oh, and Eddie's no less- not much less of a stranger than I am?

2355
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:14,080
Alright.

2356
02:13:19,460 --> 02:13:27,200
If anything, Eddie is even more of a fucking- oh, that's it, there's- oh my god, that's so- That makes me uncomfortable.

2357
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,700
That's where he was.

2358
02:13:38,660 --> 02:13:39,160
What?

2359
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:42,420
Did she go outside?

2360
02:13:43,180 --> 02:13:44,800
I'm gonna use the bathroom here.

2361
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:49,340
She went outside?

2362
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:51,460
Okay, that's enough time for me to explore.

2363
02:13:55,570 --> 02:13:57,430
Molly, thank you for the super chat.

2364
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:58,630
Thank you, thank you.

2365
02:14:04,010 --> 02:14:05,870
Okay, maybe there's more stuff here.

2366
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:09,730
Look, we gotta loot, okay guys?

2367
02:14:09,770 --> 02:14:10,510
This is important.

2368
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:15,910
We can go after Laura whenever the- look, she ran out on her own free will.

2369
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:19,630
Okay, nice, more bullets.

2370
02:14:24,330 --> 02:14:28,090
She's the one that decided to run out, guys.

2371
02:14:29,450 --> 02:14:30,750
I'm not her guardian.

2372
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:36,990
If anything, it's even more dangerous for me to approach her because I am a stranger.

2373
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:54,800
If anything, Maria should be the one to approach her, not me.

2374
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:57,860
People are gonna be like, what the fuck are you trying to chase after this little girl?

2375
02:14:58,540 --> 02:15:00,520
I'm just trying to make sure that...

2376
02:15:01,820 --> 02:15:03,140
I'm doing the right thing.

2377
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:08,860
It doesn't help that I'm wearing a dog mask too, so that does not help my case.

2378
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:12,400
But wearing this dog mask is a fucking choice.

2379
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:19,600
You see the little- that's like the fucking weirdest thing to ask somebody.

2380
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,060
Oh no, why are you at the hospital?

2381
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:35,820
Oh no, it's the goddamn- Oh no, it's the hospital, no.

2382
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:47,340
No, not the fucking- Leave, please do not stay with me if you're coming with me to the hospital.

2383
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:50,600
Please, there's hot nurses and I don't know what to do.

2384
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:57,960
Please, I cannot protect you no more.

2385
02:15:58,160 --> 02:16:01,580
I'm gonna let the beasts unleash here in the hospital.

2386
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:07,760
Alright, let's- Okay, here we go.

2387
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:10,580
Alright, let's see if there's...

2388
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:15,200
The crow- oh no, there's a shotgun here.

2389
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:16,360
Okay.

2390
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:23,500
Your weapon pointed- okay, there's apparently a shotgun here.

2391
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,820
And where the fuck is the shotgun?

2392
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:35,680
Oh my god, okay, we're not in the other world yet, so that's good.

2393
02:16:35,820 --> 02:16:36,980
Wait, is there a map in there?

2394
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:41,000
Where- where's the map?

2395
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:47,900
Where is the map?

2396
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:49,360
I don't know which way to go.

2397
02:16:50,420 --> 02:16:51,300
Go to the right?

2398
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:52,440
Oh wait, is that the map?

2399
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:53,280
Oh, there it is.

2400
02:16:54,020 --> 02:16:54,380
Alright.

2401
02:16:56,780 --> 02:16:58,080
That's a lot of rooms.

2402
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:04,720
Oh my god, we're not at the other world yet though, so...

2403
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:07,320
Maybe things will not be as bad.

2404
02:17:11,980 --> 02:17:13,200
Oh shit, is this depression?

2405
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:16,900
Oh shit.

2406
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:22,260
Okay, that's not good.

2407
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:23,980
Laura, there you are.

2408
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:33,740
It's okay, we don't want to hurt you.

2409
02:17:42,060 --> 02:17:44,460
Oh, she was the one that's drawing this.

2410
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:48,720
Why is she running from- I don't know, James!

2411
02:17:51,940 --> 02:17:53,440
I don't know.

2412
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:57,580
Strangers are always not a great- James, I don't know.

2413
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:03,980
You don't even know this little girl, and you- I don't know, James.

2414
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,440
Do you even know Laura?

2415
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,920
Do you even know her?

2416
02:18:08,300 --> 02:18:10,560
Why is she running from me?

2417
02:18:15,570 --> 02:18:16,070
Alright.

2418
02:18:18,690 --> 02:18:22,590
The director requested the files of the three crucial patients.

2419
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:23,290
You know which one.

2420
02:18:23,650 --> 02:18:25,150
Can you please bring them to the office?

2421
02:18:31,130 --> 02:18:32,210
Oh no.

2422
02:18:33,130 --> 02:18:33,990
Oh no.

2423
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:37,650
Oh no.

2424
02:18:39,530 --> 02:18:40,430
Oh no.

2425
02:18:40,430 --> 02:18:41,730
Oh shit, thank god there's a save.

2426
02:18:41,890 --> 02:18:43,050
Oh my god, thank god.

2427
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,280
Wait,

2428
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:53,780
did I already miss it?

2429
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:56,840
Alright.

2430
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:05,180
Did I already find the- Did I already find the note or nah?

2431
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:16,220
Oh, you guys fuckers.

2432
02:19:16,380 --> 02:19:17,020
You fuckers.

2433
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:27,580
You think I don't remember your name, fucking Solid Snake?

2434
02:19:27,740 --> 02:19:34,220
Oh, I'm gonna- Alright, the moment this turns to the other world is over.

2435
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:37,720
The moment we see the nurse, I'm fucking out of here.

2436
02:19:47,660 --> 02:19:48,100
Alright.

2437
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:53,860
We go up.

2438
02:19:59,470 --> 02:20:00,510
Alright, up we go.

2439
02:20:00,510 --> 02:20:01,930
Oh wait, how do we go down?

2440
02:20:02,790 --> 02:20:03,590
What's downstairs?

2441
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:08,860
Okay, it's still locked.

2442
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:11,920
Oh my god, we're gonna be in the hospital for- Oh no.

2443
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:16,120
I can tell we're gonna be in the hospital for a while.

2444
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:19,120
Why are there so many doors and keys?

2445
02:20:24,430 --> 02:20:24,990
Okay.

2446
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:29,330
Wait, what?

2447
02:20:30,150 --> 02:20:32,230
I can't even go through this door.

2448
02:20:34,070 --> 02:20:35,190
What?

2449
02:20:40,210 --> 02:20:42,410
That door doesn't work.

2450
02:20:44,130 --> 02:20:46,110
Am I missing something?

2451
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:55,720
Oh shit!

2452
02:21:00,490 --> 02:21:01,570
Okay.

2453
02:21:05,490 --> 02:21:06,050
Okay.

2454
02:21:09,930 --> 02:21:10,730
Okay.

2455
02:21:12,550 --> 02:21:14,090
Alright, here we go.

2456
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:19,670
Elevator?

2457
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:25,870
Oh, apparently I don't have fucking fingers no more.

2458
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:36,740
This has to be close to the other world now.

2459
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:40,460
Wait, what?

2460
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:47,980
What is keeping me out?

2461
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:50,660
I see window.

2462
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:52,600
I break!

2463
02:21:54,220 --> 02:21:55,720
There's no laws here.

2464
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:57,400
Except for that door.

2465
02:21:58,220 --> 02:21:59,500
There's no laws here.

2466
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:02,880
Oh, there it is.

2467
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:04,600
I wrote down for you what you should remember.

2468
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:07,120
Once you're in the lobby, just look around.

2469
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:11,740
Now remember, nurses- Oh my- Nurses, doctors, trees.

2470
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:12,260
Okay.

2471
02:22:13,860 --> 02:22:15,620
Okay, a riddle.

2472
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:20,340
Alright, we gotta count the nurses, doctors, and trees.

2473
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:24,200
I can break the cabinets?

2474
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:24,780
What?

2475
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:29,280
What cabinets?

2476
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:33,660
Alright.

2477
02:22:35,620 --> 02:22:36,780
Which one?

2478
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:39,920
Which one?

2479
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:39,920
Four cabinets?

2480
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:42,160
Oh, this one!

2481
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:43,840
Oh my god, I didn't even see that.

2482
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:47,120
I knew I could break it, but I wasn't paying attention.

2483
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:49,540
Okay.

2484
02:22:51,380 --> 02:22:52,780
You guys all know that.

2485
02:22:56,600 --> 02:22:59,340
Okay, nurses, doctors, trees.

2486
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:03,500
What's- Guys, I know what tree is, but where's the tree at?

2487
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:05,260
Okay, oh, there you go.

2488
02:23:05,540 --> 02:23:05,720
Four.

2489
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:07,720
Four.

2490
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:10,320
Alright, two, four.

2491
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:13,200
Two, four, six, seven.

2492
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:14,900
Seven, two, four.

2493
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:15,540
Seven, two, four.

2494
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:17,180
Alright.

2495
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:18,900
I'm smart.

2496
02:23:20,860 --> 02:23:22,700
Seven, two, four.

2497
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:24,580
There you go.

2498
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,280
Oh, we did it.

2499
02:23:27,420 --> 02:23:28,160
We did it.

2500
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:29,000
We got the basement.

2501
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:29,820
Basement.

2502
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:32,440
Of course.

2503
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:33,420
Okay.

2504
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:40,280
It was actually- Oh, wait, I had to un- I must have had to grab the note.

2505
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:44,820
I must have had to grab the note to get seven, two, four.

2506
02:23:47,820 --> 02:23:50,800
This place feels so empty.

2507
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:51,860
Oh my god.

2508
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:53,820
Look at the basement.

2509
02:23:54,620 --> 02:23:56,280
Okay, I got this.

2510
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:58,160
At least they're hot.

2511
02:23:58,160 --> 02:24:00,280
Just remember, Doki.

2512
02:24:00,820 --> 02:24:03,800
They might not have faces and they might want to try and kill you.

2513
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:05,500
But, hey.

2514
02:24:06,140 --> 02:24:08,000
You die doing what you love.

2515
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:11,160
Okay.

2516
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,500
It's been three years.

2517
02:24:18,370 --> 02:24:19,090
This?

2518
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:20,570
No, okay.

2519
02:24:22,810 --> 02:24:23,530
Okay.

2520
02:24:24,410 --> 02:24:26,050
Hello, nurse.

2521
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:29,190
Hello, nurse?

2522
02:24:30,970 --> 02:24:31,290
What?

2523
02:24:34,940 --> 02:24:36,020
It is?

2524
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:41,400
Why is she still following me?

2525
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:43,620
I agree.

2526
02:24:43,860 --> 02:24:45,380
By the way, I have 58 bullets.

2527
02:24:45,460 --> 02:24:46,340
Do you think that's enough?

2528
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:50,320
Sorry.

2529
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,840
61 now.

2530
02:24:57,920 --> 02:24:58,800
No.

2531
02:24:58,960 --> 02:24:59,840
No, okay.

2532
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:02,200
Guess I gotta hoard them more.

2533
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:12,880
Oh god, I need...

2534
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:13,780
Like, I need...

2535
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:15,180
Oil?

2536
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:16,060
Gas?

2537
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:28,040
Thank you for the superchat.

2538
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:29,180
Thank you.

2539
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:30,160
What?

2540
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:34,100
Bro, what the...

2541
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:35,340
Okay, that...

2542
02:25:36,260 --> 02:25:37,860
I was promised nurses.

2543
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:42,320
What the...

2544
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:43,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

2545
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:45,200
You don't...

2546
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:46,340
You just legs.

2547
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:48,100
Where?

2548
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:53,100
Oh my god, I was promised nurses.

2549
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,740
This is not what I signed up for.

2550
02:25:56,940 --> 02:25:59,680
This was not what I signed up for.

2551
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:03,860
Hahaha.

2552
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:10,200
I didn't realize there were other monsters here.

2553
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:13,700
I was fucking promised a nurse.

2554
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:18,600
But they're not nurses?

2555
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,250
Bro, what?

2556
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:24,860
Did they like come from...

2557
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:26,820
I swear.

2558
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:30,440
I swear, they...

2559
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:31,780
They jump from a...

2560
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:32,900
Do they jump from above?

2561
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:36,420
I just didn't see.

2562
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:37,220
I must have not just saw.

2563
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:38,540
I just must have not seen it.

2564
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:44,720
Did they jump from above?

2565
02:26:49,460 --> 02:26:50,300
Gamers don't know.

2566
02:26:50,480 --> 02:26:52,020
Of course I don't look up.

2567
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:57,920
Holy shit, that scared the shit out of me.

2568
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:00,000
Bro, now they're gonna be up?

2569
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:02,900
That's cheating!

2570
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:05,820
That's actually cheating.

2571
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:06,800
Holy shit.

2572
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:07,540
That...

2573
02:27:09,420 --> 02:27:10,100
Where?

2574
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,360
Actually, where?

2575
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:17,600
Holy cow.

2576
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:18,740
I swear.

2577
02:27:19,160 --> 02:27:19,480
What?

2578
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:23,160
I swear.

2579
02:27:23,540 --> 02:27:24,040
I looked.

2580
02:27:24,180 --> 02:27:24,960
I even looked.

2581
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:27,000
I even like made sure to look.

2582
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:31,800
Oh my god, these fuckers.

2583
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:36,180
Please don't kill me this time.

2584
02:27:36,180 --> 02:27:36,980
You're not...

2585
02:27:36,980 --> 02:27:37,760
You're not...

2586
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:39,920
You're not gonna fool me this time.

2587
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:41,080
That's right.

2588
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:43,260
Okay, I'm okay.

2589
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:50,140
Literally in my walls right now.

2590
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:52,060
I don't get anything from it.

2591
02:27:57,570 --> 02:27:58,330
I...

2592
02:27:58,330 --> 02:28:03,890
Where did you come from?

2593
02:28:04,230 --> 02:28:05,310
I barely heard

2594
02:28:08,410 --> 02:28:08,770
you.

2595
02:28:10,230 --> 02:28:12,250
What the fuck?

2596
02:28:12,690 --> 02:28:15,090
Where did that guy come from?

2597
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:16,610
Hey, just got the map.

2598
02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:17,330
Let's go.

2599
02:28:21,730 --> 02:28:24,270
Oh my god.

2600
02:28:25,450 --> 02:28:28,310
That was actually bullshit.

2601
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:31,170
Oh, it just wanted to leave.

2602
02:28:33,390 --> 02:28:36,410
Bro, that one was actually bullshit.

2603
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:37,950
Holy shit.

2604
02:28:43,030 --> 02:28:44,690
Oh my god.

2605
02:28:44,870 --> 02:28:45,970
Oh, it's empty?

2606
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:53,310
There's a cart I could push?

2607
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:53,850
Where?

2608
02:28:59,300 --> 02:28:59,760
Bye.

2609
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:05,880
Okay.

2610
02:29:10,690 --> 02:29:11,950
It's E, right?

2611
02:29:16,770 --> 02:29:18,350
No, I couldn't get there.

2612
02:29:20,330 --> 02:29:21,770
Yeah, it did a full circle.

2613
02:29:21,990 --> 02:29:24,490
So I'm like trying to figure out where the fucking oil is.

2614
02:29:24,970 --> 02:29:25,690
Or gas.

2615
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:34,420
I went to the storage yet?

2616
02:29:34,460 --> 02:29:35,480
I did, right?

2617
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:36,780
Yeah, I went to pick that up.

2618
02:29:42,370 --> 02:29:43,790
I saw a hole in the...

2619
02:29:43,790 --> 02:29:44,390
Oh, okay.

2620
02:29:44,530 --> 02:29:46,390
I don't remember.

2621
02:29:46,690 --> 02:29:48,530
I don't remember.

2622
02:29:50,910 --> 02:29:55,930
Guys, I don't know if you know this, but I don't remember where things are.

2623
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:06,600
How do we push this?

2624
02:30:06,700 --> 02:30:07,900
It has to be in this room.

2625
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:10,260
But like, where's the...

2626
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:11,240
Oh, there it is.

2627
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:11,560
Okay.

2628
02:30:12,660 --> 02:30:13,420
There it is.

2629
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:14,060
There's the cart.

2630
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:15,700
We fucking did it, boys.

2631
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,960
Mario, you wanna fucking give me space here?

2632
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:25,160
Does it fit in the square hole?

2633
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:25,800
It does.

2634
02:30:25,900 --> 02:30:26,440
Let's go.

2635
02:30:28,720 --> 02:30:29,240
Okay.

2636
02:30:30,580 --> 02:30:33,420
I still wanna know where the fuck that guy came from.

2637
02:30:33,860 --> 02:30:35,820
That's the guy that just...

2638
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:37,460
Like...

2639
02:30:38,660 --> 02:30:40,640
Like, where did he come from?

2640
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:41,720
That was crazy.

2641
02:30:52,590 --> 02:30:54,110
I fill up the gas.

2642
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:56,290
Gas, gas, gas.

2643
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:05,900
And then he was like, you're gonna open the door?

2644
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:06,380
Let me...

2645
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:09,500
He's just like, why did you hit me?

2646
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:11,640
I just wanna go through the door.

2647
02:31:15,780 --> 02:31:18,060
Bro, that guy fucking jumpscared me.

2648
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:19,780
Of course I was gonna slap him.

2649
02:31:25,510 --> 02:31:26,990
Oh.

2650
02:31:27,250 --> 02:31:28,430
Oh.

2651
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:36,660
Oh.

2652
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:39,940
Back around.

2653
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:44,800
We're doing a little Mario go round.

2654
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,440
Back at it again.

2655
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:53,180
It was this way.

2656
02:31:58,300 --> 02:31:59,600
Oh my god.

2657
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:02,800
I put the generator on.

2658
02:32:13,450 --> 02:32:14,510
Okay.

2659
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:16,130
On.

2660
02:32:17,190 --> 02:32:18,450
Oh nice.

2661
02:32:18,710 --> 02:32:19,690
There's light.

2662
02:32:20,270 --> 02:32:21,650
Thank god there's light.

2663
02:32:23,090 --> 02:32:24,470
Oh thank god.

2664
02:32:25,510 --> 02:32:27,350
We can use the elevator.

2665
02:32:28,990 --> 02:32:30,210
Nice, there's one...

2666
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:31,690
Oh my god, okay.

2667
02:32:36,690 --> 02:32:39,150
I don't know what his plans were.

2668
02:32:41,190 --> 02:32:42,550
Like, I...

2669
02:32:42,550 --> 02:32:43,850
What was your plan?

2670
02:32:43,850 --> 02:32:46,190
What was your plan?

2671
02:32:46,410 --> 02:32:47,190
I... okay.

2672
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:48,150
I...

2673
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:52,870
I don't know what he was trying to do.

2674
02:32:53,390 --> 02:32:55,090
I don't know.

2675
02:32:56,950 --> 02:32:59,850
What the fuck was that?

2676
02:33:02,110 --> 02:33:04,170
His best, okay.

2677
02:33:06,430 --> 02:33:08,610
Wait, is it gonna open?

2678
02:33:09,510 --> 02:33:10,110
Oh, okay.

2679
02:33:16,540 --> 02:33:17,460
Alright.

2680
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:20,040
Oh.

2681
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:22,080
Wait a minute.

2682
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:24,100
Wait a minute.

2683
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:26,500
Wait a minute.

2684
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:28,800
I'm in the other world.

2685
02:33:32,660 --> 02:33:33,520
We're here.

2686
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:37,500
Wait a minute.

2687
02:33:37,740 --> 02:33:38,880
I turned on the lights.

2688
02:33:38,980 --> 02:33:40,200
How did it get darker?

2689
02:33:40,820 --> 02:33:45,660
How the fuck did it get darker?

2690
02:33:46,580 --> 02:33:48,400
Alright guys, we're calling it here.

2691
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:49,060
It got darker.

2692
02:33:49,240 --> 02:33:51,120
It was either other world or darkness.

2693
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:56,880
It was other world or dark...

2694
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,600
And we made it to the other world.

2695
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:01,720
We're stopping here.

2696
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:04,380
We're stopping here guys.

2697
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:06,460
It was one or the other.

2698
02:34:06,980 --> 02:34:08,660
And that part was...

2699
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:13,320
We'll get nurses on the next playthrough.

2700
02:34:13,660 --> 02:34:14,500
Okay guys?

2701
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:16,800
Nurses at the next one.

2702
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:18,940
You get to see...

2703
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:21,220
You get to be more hype for nurses.

2704
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:25,660
There actually is not other world in this one.

2705
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:26,800
Only darkness.

2706
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:29,700
Okay, well it got dark and I'm a pussy.

2707
02:34:29,900 --> 02:34:30,960
So I'm a chicken.

2708
02:34:31,380 --> 02:34:33,140
So we got it here.

2709
02:34:33,660 --> 02:34:34,620
Oh my god.

2710
02:34:34,680 --> 02:34:35,920
What a long day today.

2711
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:37,540
Today was a long day.

2712
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:39,940
But I always had so much fun hanging out with you guys, dragons.

2713
02:34:40,180 --> 02:34:41,040
It's always great.

2714
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:43,480
I'm glad you guys...

2715
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:45,940
I hope you guys had a good time watching.

2716
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:47,920
Not gonna lie.

2717
02:34:48,060 --> 02:34:50,480
Like I said, Silent Hill is...

2718
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:53,400
So fucking scary man.

2719
02:34:53,540 --> 02:34:55,520
Silent Hill, I've never...

2720
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:56,920
I'm just...

2721
02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:57,860
I'm just scared.

2722
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:00,260
It's just scary.

2723
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:06,040
I think I hate this game as much as you.

2724
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:07,180
Screw this stupid game.

2725
02:35:07,320 --> 02:35:08,860
I hate all of this game.

2726
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:10,240
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

2727
02:35:10,340 --> 02:35:11,280
Thank you, thank you.

2728
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:13,560
Lali, thank you for the super chat.

2729
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:14,660
Thank you, thank you.

2730
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:16,300
Like, I just...

2731
02:35:16,300 --> 02:35:17,160
I don't know what to say.

2732
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:19,280
Like, it is...

2733
02:35:24,220 --> 02:35:25,140
It's just...

2734
02:35:25,140 --> 02:35:27,280
It's just fucking...

2735
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:37,600
But yeah, it just freaks me out a lot.

2736
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:38,280
Trying to...

2737
02:35:40,180 --> 02:35:41,100
Trying to...

2738
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:43,960
Play Silent Hill because it's just...

2739
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:45,440
The ambience is so good.

2740
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:47,360
The ambience is very good.

2741
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:49,000
And it makes me...

2742
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,280
Like, makes me like...

2743
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:52,300
What do I do?

2744
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:53,960
What do I do?

2745
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:02,300
It does what it does really, really well.

2746
02:36:02,340 --> 02:36:03,620
In terms of...

2747
02:36:03,620 --> 02:36:05,780
The spooky factor of it.

2748
02:36:07,740 --> 02:36:10,340
Yeah, it's legendary for a reason.

2749
02:36:10,340 --> 02:36:10,620
Yeah.

2750
02:36:10,980 --> 02:36:13,220
I'm glad they did a remake of this.

2751
02:36:13,320 --> 02:36:15,140
So like, it's more accessible to play.

2752
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:18,280
But oh my god.

2753
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:19,600
My heart though.

2754
02:36:20,020 --> 02:36:22,140
Like, I know I like joke around a lot.

2755
02:36:22,260 --> 02:36:23,320
But oh my gosh.

2756
02:36:23,460 --> 02:36:25,160
I have to joke around.

2757
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:26,480
To like...

2758
02:36:27,060 --> 02:36:28,480
To try and play through.

2759
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:30,260
Like, to try and like progress.

2760
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:32,560
Or I'll be like really scared.

2761
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:35,160
Thank you for the super chat.

2762
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:35,940
Thank you, thank you.

2763
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:38,640
Do you think the game being quiet most of the time is what freaks you out the most?

2764
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:39,980
I think that...

2765
02:36:39,980 --> 02:36:40,740
And the fact that...

2766
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:41,640
Like I said before.

2767
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:43,660
It's the fact that like...

2768
02:36:43,660 --> 02:36:46,140
Monsters don't die, die.

2769
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:47,240
Like, they come back.

2770
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:48,580
So I always have this fear.

2771
02:36:48,980 --> 02:36:49,740
Of like...

2772
02:36:49,740 --> 02:36:50,620
Oh my god.

2773
02:36:50,660 --> 02:36:52,220
When are they gonna come back alive?

2774
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:53,080
Like...

2775
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:53,480
And shit.

2776
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:54,180
Like, it just...

2777
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:55,100
It just freaks me out.

2778
02:36:55,140 --> 02:36:57,120
And then they always try to jump scare you too.

2779
02:36:57,400 --> 02:36:58,600
Cause they're always lurking.

2780
02:36:58,960 --> 02:37:00,120
They're not like...

2781
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:01,720
It's not like...

2782
02:37:01,720 --> 02:37:02,340
Like you can...

2783
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:04,580
It's not easy to tell when they show up.

2784
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:06,940
So you're always trying to check your corners and everything.

2785
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:09,360
And that's like...

2786
02:37:09,360 --> 02:37:09,940
Really...

2787
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:11,380
It's just really like...

2788
02:37:11,380 --> 02:37:11,760
Oh my god.

2789
02:37:11,780 --> 02:37:12,660
What do I do?

2790
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:13,720
What do...

2791
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:16,100
What do I do?

2792
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:19,280
No one...

2793
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:19,860
Yeah, exactly.

2794
02:37:19,980 --> 02:37:21,120
No one ever dies.

2795
02:37:21,220 --> 02:37:21,940
So I'm just like...

2796
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:28,100
Hey, guys.

2797
02:37:28,860 --> 02:37:29,880
Thank you for the super chat.

2798
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:30,160
Thank you.

2799
02:37:30,180 --> 02:37:30,520
Thank you.

2800
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:31,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

2801
02:37:31,620 --> 02:37:33,820
I'm having a great time watching someone else play.

2802
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:36,420
While I sit in the brightly lit room.

2803
02:37:36,420 --> 02:37:37,340
Thank you for the super chat.

2804
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:37,700
Thank you.

2805
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:38,420
Thank you.

2806
02:37:38,580 --> 02:37:41,220
Yeah, I have all my lights turned on right now.

2807
02:37:41,320 --> 02:37:42,640
When I play Silent Hill.

2808
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:43,600
It's just...

2809
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:46,140
Like I can't play this game in the dark at all.

2810
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:48,700
But yeah.

2811
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:50,520
I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

2812
02:37:51,140 --> 02:37:53,420
And I hope you guys enjoyed...

2813
02:37:55,340 --> 02:37:56,600
Hanging out today.

2814
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:58,160
For a full day today.

2815
02:37:58,580 --> 02:38:00,220
It's been a great time.

2816
02:38:01,300 --> 02:38:03,220
Tomorrow we do have two streams.

2817
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:04,760
One is the Shinova tournament.

2818
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:06,680
It is like knockout stage.

2819
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:08,200
So that means...

2820
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:08,840
That means...

2821
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,520
If we don't...

2822
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:13,580
We can basically end the stream after one game.

2823
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:15,180
So we'll see how it goes.

2824
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:16,060
We'll see how it goes.

2825
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:17,480
I know like there's a lot of games.

2826
02:38:17,660 --> 02:38:18,580
Like the second...

2827
02:38:18,580 --> 02:38:19,300
The tournament stream.

2828
02:38:19,400 --> 02:38:20,200
The second day too.

2829
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:21,720
I'm not sponsored for day two.

2830
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:24,160
I'm actually only sponsored for day one.

2831
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:28,860
So I can basically say whatever the fuck I want on day two.

2832
02:38:30,580 --> 02:38:32,040
Thank you for the super chat.

2833
02:38:32,120 --> 02:38:32,400
Thank you.

2834
02:38:32,440 --> 02:38:33,180
Thank you.

2835
02:38:33,180 --> 02:38:35,620
I literally covered half of my screen.

2836
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:37,540
The stream was on towards the end there.

2837
02:38:37,740 --> 02:38:38,660
Thank you for the super chat.

2838
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:39,060
Thank you.

2839
02:38:39,220 --> 02:38:39,920
Thank you.

2840
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:41,720
Anyway guys.

2841
02:38:41,860 --> 02:38:42,220
To be fair.

2842
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:43,360
I said we...

2843
02:38:43,360 --> 02:38:44,340
Me and Surefour.

2844
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:46,200
We're both sponsored on our team.

2845
02:38:46,660 --> 02:38:48,520
Said a lot of things on day one.

2846
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:50,020
No, we were already unhinged.

2847
02:38:50,380 --> 02:38:51,220
We were...

2848
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:52,440
I don't know how...

2849
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:53,740
How we could get worse.

2850
02:38:53,820 --> 02:38:56,740
Cause like we were already very unhinged on day one.

2851
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:01,040
But yeah.

2852
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:01,800
And then after that.

2853
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:02,900
We're gonna do...

2854
02:39:02,900 --> 02:39:03,900
Goodnight Dragons.

2855
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:05,460
At nine.

2856
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:07,340
So yeah.

2857
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:08,900
And then Sunday there's no stream obviously.

2858
02:39:09,060 --> 02:39:10,020
Cause Sunday's my rest day.

2859
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:11,700
But as always everybody.

2860
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:12,460
Stay hydrated.

2861
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:12,880
Posture.

2862
02:39:13,060 --> 02:39:13,860
Get up and move around.

2863
02:39:13,940 --> 02:39:14,900
To get that blood flowing.

2864
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:15,940
And if you stay up for me.

2865
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:16,740
Head to bed.

2866
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:18,000
Cause you deserve it.

2867
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:19,240
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2868
02:39:19,640 --> 02:39:20,380
Bye guys.

2869
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:21,360
Bye.
