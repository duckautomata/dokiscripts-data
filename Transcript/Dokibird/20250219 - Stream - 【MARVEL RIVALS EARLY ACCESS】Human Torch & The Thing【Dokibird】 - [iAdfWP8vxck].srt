00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,920
Hello.

2
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:01,620
If I sound dead and sad, and if I sound sick, it's because I am not okay right now.

3
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,940
Doki, why don't you just take today off?

4
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:14,940
I thought today would be the day I'd recover, but clearly my immune system has other plans.

5
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,980
For those who don't know, because you guys don't have a Twitter, which is very understandable.

6
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,380
I mean, Twitter's a fucking mess right now.

7
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,380
I mean, not right now, but it's been that way for a while now.

8
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:39,280
Also, waiting for my game to fully... waiting for the for the early access build to fully extract.

9
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,860
Okay, there we go.

10
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,380
Sorry, this is why we don't have our game yet.

11
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,360
All right, sorry, this is why this is why we don't have our game yet.

12
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,340
We're waiting for the gate, for the early access build to fully extract.

13
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,140
So it says here we're at 54 percent.

14
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,560
So I have seven minutes left.

15
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:13,380
Okay, so um this game, I don't know why it's 50 gigabytes because it's like a whole new file that you have to download at the NetEase website.

16
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,620
Um, so like I just have to, I just have to wait for that.

17
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,640
So I should have woke up at four and done it, but I took a nap and woke up at 4 30.

18
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
Um, because I was, I don't know, so I was, I'm sick.

19
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,740
I've been, I've been sleeping the whole day, most of the whole day yesterday and the day before.

20
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,260
And I don't know, when did I get sick?

21
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,940
I think I got sick like three days ago.

22
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:45,700
So like, I got sick after the day after Doki Amber Doge's birthday.

23
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,140
Um, so, so I woke up the day, I think it's because I went, I went outside.

24
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,460
I think I, my body ever since COVID, my body has not been okay.

25
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:17,720
My body, my body has like regressed as like, you know how like you, you know, you're, the human body has like built itself to be strong after centuries and centuries of being exposed to viruses.

26
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:39,820
Well, like my body has done the opposite of that since COVID started in a way where I became a bubble, a bubble girl, like a bubble baby for so long, where I was stuck inside for so long that my body was like, wow, bacteria doesn't exist anymore.

27
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:50,200
We don't have to focus on being resistant amongst viruses if viruses don't exist anymore.

28
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:05,590
So I feel like the last year my body was like, what are all these new things?

29
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:28,540
My body's just like, oh my god, like, like one bacteria like comes in and was like, hey guys, like inside my body and then all my white blood cells just fucking was like, are like, oh my god, take everything, here, take it all.

30
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:39,100
Because they're not, they haven't been exposed to like, you know, criminals in so long that they

31
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,800
forgot how the immune system itself.

32
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,040
So, um, time for bubble Tokyo.

33
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,320
Thank you for the super chat.

34
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:52,740
Thank you.

35
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,500
Thank you.

36
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,960
So like, I'm not doing okay.

37
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,100
I'm in maps.

38
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,660
If I'm being truthful to you guys, I'm not doing okay right now.

39
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,360
Thank you for this super chat.

40
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:06,860
Thank you.

41
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,520
Thank you.

42
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,920
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,200
Thank you.

44
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,780
Thank you.

45
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,860
Yeah, sorry, I'm breathing.

46
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,080
I cannot breathe through my nose.

47
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,360
So you're gonna be like, love you.

48
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,520

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,060
Thank you.

50
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,840
Thank you.

51
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,680
Dad spreading his allergies of everything over to you.

52
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,860
Hope rivals distracted from the sickness.

53
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,100
Thank you for the super chat.

54
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,600
Thank you.

55
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,680
I'm like, I say one sentence.

56
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,500
I'm like, I feel like I ran a marathon.

57
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:32,960
I'm like,

58
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Oh my god, I feel like a fucking pug genetically fucked right now.

59
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,680
Oh my god.

60
00:06:52,420 --> 00:07:01,840
Oh, so like, um, I legitimately when I made my schedule yesterday, I was like, will I be good enough for tomorrow for the early access?

61
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,540
Because I was told that, oh, yeah, early access is coming out tomorrow.

62
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,260
And I was like, wait, do you think I could access it?

63
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,120
Like, will you, do you read your discord messages?

64
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,460
I was like, no.

65
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,020
And then I looked, I was like, oh my god.

66
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,440
I could do it.

67
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Oh my god, I can, I can access it.

68
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,360
So I was like, yippee!

69
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,540
So, I'm sorry, I'm breathing so heavily.

70
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,040
I'm like,

71
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,340
Oh my god, I'm not okay.

72
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,680
Oh my god, okay.

73
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:52,500
And so I was like, in my dying breath, if I'm gonna die today, I, I, I want, I want my 4i was to be my last stream.

74
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
That's how I want to go out.

75
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,120
I want this to be my last stream on my channel.

76
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,820
That's how I want to go out, chat.

77
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,480
Doki, please.

78
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,740
No, Doki!

79
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:27,600
Anyway, um, um, but yes, I, I was like, on the day after Doki Amberdoge's birthday, I was like, why does my throat feel closed up?

80
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,180
I was like, oh, is that bad?

81
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,140
Oh, no, that's bad.

82
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,800
Maybe it'll be better later.

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:43,800
So like, when I woke up, I also bought like $130 worth of the, over the, like, worth of medication.

84
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,140
I'm like, obviously I didn't go to a doctor because I'm Canadian.

85
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,840
Canadian problems right now.

86
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,800
So I just, I just uber eat some over-the-counter meds.

87
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
Did you guys hear that?

88
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,940
Wow!

89
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,920
I bought like three different forms of time.

90
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,120
I did not mix my medication!

91
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,540
I'm just testing them out every like, um, every day.

92
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,580
So like, day one, I'll try this medication if it doesn't work.

93
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,720
Day two, I tried this other.

94
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,360
Yes, I uber-eated my medication because I didn't want to go outside.

95
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,340
Doki Amberdoge is also at the babysitter right now.

96
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,300
So like, I literally woke up and I was like, I can't walk my dog.

97
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,260
I legit am barely surviving right now.

98
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,900
Because like, day one of the, no, no, no, no, no!

99
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,240
It's more so of like, because like, these are, it's just time though.

100
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,060
It's just time.

101
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,840
Oh guys, so like, I'm not mixing any medication guys.

102
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,240
I'm not, you always be popping.

103
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,220
No, no!

104
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,060
I'm not mixing anything.

105
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,180
It's legit.

106
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,520
These are like, you take them every four to six hours.

107
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:59,460
So I'm like, so I have like, so I have like, Tyenol for sinuses.

108
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,660
I have that one, which I'm taking for today.

109
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,820
And then yesterday, I tried out Tyenol.

110
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,180
I'm not a person anymore.

111
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,780
I'm, uh, the day, yes, I'm not mixing it!

112
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,040
I'm not!

113
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,660
Do not mix medication!

114
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,720
I'm literally, yesterday, I tried out the cough syrup, Buckley's cough syrup.

115
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:37,180
Which is like, fast relief of dry cough, sore throat pain, nasal and sinus, uh, uh, uh, yeah, that.

116
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:48,940
So like, there's, I tried that, um, and then, um, and then tomorrow, I'm gonna try out, I don't know which one I'm gonna try out tomorrow.

117
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,040
They're all Tyenol.

118
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm sorry, I didn't buy Advil.

119
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,840
I tried to buy a different one, um, uh, and then tomorrow, I'm either gonna try Tyenol.

120
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,440
Sorry, they're all Tyenol.

121
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,900
Um, Just spin the wheel.

122
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:20,400
I'm gonna try out Tyenol rap action rapid or either Tyenol cold and sinus.

123
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,420
Today, I'm trying the Tyenol for sinuses.

124
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,100
But tomorrow, I might try to go wild and do the cold and sinuses.

125
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,880
So it's like both and I was like, well, I technically I do have both.

126
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,620
Um, It's all Tyenol.

127
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,720
No, no, no.

128
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,420
I have buckies right here.

129
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,160
Bucklies, you hear that?

130
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,600
I've got buck- I don't know if you guys hear me.

131
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,860
Whoa.

132
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,520
There's bucklies.

133
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,400
I have, I have bucklies right here.

134
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,180
I did that yesterday.

135
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,980
Um, oh my god, I'm not okay.

136
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,580
I- Okay, this isn't- okay.

137
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,380
So like I was telling my friend, I was telling my friend about how hard it is.

138
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
Also, I don't want to go- I don't want to line up.

139
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,260
It's either you go or you line up at a um, at a doctor's for like hours.

140
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,780
Um, Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to breathe.

141
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,820
Oh shit.

142
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,300
You know, my issues of why I can't go to the doctors.

143
00:12:43,300 --> 00:13:00,320
And so and then they're like, oh I have a friend, um, I have a friend That's a doctor and then he could just prescribe you medication and like just like that.

144
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,920
I was like, is that illegal?

145
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,610
Okay, I don't need that.

146
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,210
I was like, that sounds like illegal as hell.

147
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:45,510
I didn't say who my friend was just that they know a doctor who like he calls up and be like, I'm sick and I can't go to a doctor right now and they just- okay, that's very illegal.

148
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,190
And then they were like, oh man, we could do- I could do that for you too if you want.

149
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,210
I was like, I don't know, that's all right.

150
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:07,670
I'll just- I'll just use my over-the-counter medicine.

151
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,170
Don't say that, this is very illegal.

152
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,730
How the hell do I- okay, I finished extracting it.

153
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,150
Please stop snitching on yourself.

154
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,550
I said no!

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,330

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,330
How do I- how do I log in to the early access build?

166
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,890
Am I in?

167
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,650
Am I- Click to start.

168
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:06,730
Oh!

169
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,470
Oh, that's interesting.

170
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,870
Oh!

171
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,190
Wow!

172
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,290
Okay, I'm not showing you guys this because I'm pretty sure I can't.

173
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,570
I'm not allowed to on how to log in.

174
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,210
Oh my god, it like boots me.

175
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,310
Okay, I shouldn't- I was gonna explain to you guys!

176
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,270
I'm sorry.

177
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,630
My brain has not caught- my mouth hasn't caught up with my brain yet.

178
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,670
I was- I was gonna explain to you guys what I'm doing.

179
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,490
Okay.

180
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,590
All right.

181
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,570
All right, there we go.

182
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,210
I was like, I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to show you guys this in-house.

183
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,470
I was gonna- I was gonna explain it to you guys.

184
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,250
And so- Oh my god, I'm so fucked up, right?

185
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:56,850
Oh.

186
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,190
Oh.

187
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,030
Let's see.

188
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,430
Uh, Mr. Zu- Um, Mr. Zu, thank you for the super chat.

189
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:02,750
Thank you.

190
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,330
Thank you.

191
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,030
Hello, Doki.

192
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,950
I watched your VODs for the first time yesterday and fascinated with your cute laughing coolness and humor.

193
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,390
Please let me support you even a little from now on and I hope you get well soon.

194
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,170
Oh, your English is great!

195
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,730
Thank you so much for the super chat.

196
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,230
Thank you.

197
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,050
Thank you.

198
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,590
Really appreciate it.

199
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,870
Okay, let me- all right.

200
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,150
We got the game guys.

201
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,330
I knew- I knew we can stall long enough for this.

202
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,510
All right.

203
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,610
All right.

204
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:30,910
BAM!

205
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,070
Uh-oh, it should show up.

206
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,630
Whoa, you might be like, this doesn't look any different, but look at this.

207
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,010
Oh, wait.

208
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,450
No, sorry.

209
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,350
That's not different.

210
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,950
It shows- look at this!

211
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,850
There's some fucking tiger thing.

212
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,990
I don't fucking know.

213
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,870
Oh my god.

214
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,810
Look at that!

215
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,430
The torch and the thing!

216
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:50,850
Wow!

217
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,110
Okay, it should be like somewhere in here.

218
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,050
Where the fuck is- oh, there he is.

219
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:55,670
Look at him.

220
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,470
Flame on!

221
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:03,090
Okay, this guy looks- There he is!

222
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,550
The Fantastic Four's resident heartthrob.

223
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,330
Johnny Storm adds intense flair to every battle he fights.

224
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,070
Shrouded in warm flames, the Human Torch always manages to look cool while turning up the heat.

225
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,490
Oh, what are his skins?

226
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,450
Okay, is this from- oh, it's from the issue.

227
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,410
Oh, okay.

228
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,850
I mean, he looks really fucking cool.

229
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,270
Wait, what's this?

230
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,850
Negative zone gladiator.

231
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,590
Uh, came in just to hear you.

232
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,250
Med maxing.

233
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,630
Never change, Doki!

234
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,050
Never change!

235
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,110
Zero, thank you.

236
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,810
Give him a super chat.

237
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,190
Thank you.

238
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:35,750
Thank you.

239
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,690
DSP, thank you for the super chat.

240
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,290
Thank you.

241
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:38,950
Thank you.

242
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,050
D-Dragon, be honest with us, Doki.

243
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,970
Did you mix up the cost zero of anything else?

244
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,090
Thank you for the super chat.

245
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,710
Thank you.

246
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,630
Thank you.

247
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,830
No, I swear, all I had was...

248
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,690
Tylenol.

249
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,810
I mean, all I do have is Tylenol and Buckly's, but like...

250
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,810
Tylenol- oh my god, I dropped my pill bottle.

251
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,590
All I had was Tylenol sinuses, guys.

252
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,370
That's all I had.

253
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,710
A certain- or do you want new rules?

254
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,610
Everything dies?

255
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,570
No, everything.

256
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,450
Oh my god, that's depressing.

257
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:11,810
I don't know.

258
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,830
I don't know how I feel.

259
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,050
I feel like his other skin is pretty boring.

260
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,130
But I bet- I guess it's just based off the comic.

261
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,370
Um...

262
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,410
Whoa, that looks- wait, I don't want to see on that skin.

263
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,350
I mean, that looks cool.

264
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,650
What was this?

265
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,350
Is this the MVP?

266
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,890
That has to be the other MVP.

267
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,890
This guy is scary against support.

268
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,510
This guy's gonna fucking kill me.

269
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,710
As a support player, this is the guy that's gonna fucking kill me.

270
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,710
All right, the attack I'm most scared about...

271
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,670
The guy- the thing I'm most scared about...

272
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,250
Is- is it this one?

273
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:56,610
No.

274
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,630
No, it's...

275
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,130
What the fuck?

276
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,270
What the- the Invisible Woman taps your power channel to fortify the entire- oh shit!

277
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,010
So all of them will have, uh...

278
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,330
Oh, all of them will have fortify.

279
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,570
This is the one I'm most scared of.

280
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,650
This...

281
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,590
Fully destroys Luna ult.

282
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,610
A Luna ult does not save you.

283
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,970
That means...

284
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,430
Majority of the support ults don't save you.

285
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,930
Oh my god, that is scary.

286
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,290
What do I do?

287
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,050
This...

288
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,810
Out-damages a Luna ult.

289
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,090
And if this out-damages a Luna ult, it means...

290
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,970
This can out-damage...

291
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,710
Mantis ult.

292
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,430
Storm of...

293
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,230
Invisible Woman ult.

294
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,450
And Cloak and Dagger ult.

295
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,210
Because...

296
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,050
Cloak and Dagger does not stack anymore.

297
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,550
What does that mean?

298
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,210
It means that...

299
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,970
In the past, um...

300
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,250
In this season, you can stack Cloak and Dagger ult...

301
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,850
And you just go back and forth, and then the healing stacks up.

302
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,810
But it doesn't stack anymore.

303
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,490
So like...

304
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,490
You're fucked.

305
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,690
But then you could be like, oh Doki, we'll just ban...

306
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,470
The Human Torch.

307
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,570
Well, like, that's for like Diamond.

308
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,030
Well, for you Diamond and for you guys who are below Diamond...

309
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,530
You can't do that.

310
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,350
Don't support no Diamond!

311
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:36,970
Don't support no Diamond!

312
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,090
You're fucked supports!

313
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,270
Anyway, that means we're wasting another ban.

314
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,110
We're wasting, um...

315
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,410
No, I would ban the Human Torch.

316
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,750
The thing is, you have to ban both, because they're both seem really strong.

317
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,550
Because then, the Human Torch, because like Storm's damage boost is so fucking stupid.

318
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,730
Um, but you're wasting two bans on these two.

319
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,250
So that means you're leaving Wolverine open.

320
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:12,770
Okay, you're leaving Wolverine open, and you're, or you're leaving, uh, you're leaving, like, things open.

321
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,130
So there's a lot of fucked up issues here.

322
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,590
Oh my god, that's scary too.

323
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,930
People are gonna do fucking geometry on me.

324
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,270
Anything within the shape, you die.

325
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:40,590
So like, I'm gonna be watching some fucker playing Human Torch, doing shapes, fucking doing math on me, and doing simple geometry.

326
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,370
They're gonna be trying to draw a fucking shape on the floor.

327
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:53,890
And I have to like, I'll be like, looking on the floor and be like, is there a shape below me?

328
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,110
You can make a square, it doesn't have to be a triangle.

329
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,310
You can literally make, like, a square and everything.

330
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:07,450
I don't know how long, I don't know how long the flames exist for.

331
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,150
Watch out for the triangle.

332
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,590
Remember my trinometry.

333
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,050
That's what I'm scared about.

334
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,670
This is basically a boop.

335
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,290
Like, you boop people forward.

336
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,370
So, oh my god, I guess I had to deal with that.

337
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,050
What the fuck is this?

338
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,230
A bunch of fireworks that has created a flame field that's not dealing damage.

339
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,050
Another trigonometry?

340
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,270
Stop!

341
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,370
More shapes?

342
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,370
What do you mean there's more shapes?

343
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:49,050
How many times do I have to look at the floor?

344
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,730
I don't understand.

345
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,450
How many times do you require me to look at the floor?

346
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,850
Oh, fuck.

347
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,050
Okay, this is gonna be rough, guys.

348
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,250
All right, now we have the thing.

349
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,250
me in grade school learning geometry be like, all right, that thing.

350
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,970
Oh, he's difficulty one.

351
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,510
That's great.

352
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,010
He's apparently like Doomfist in Reinhardt.

353
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,690
Um, is unquestionably the rock star of any team he's on.

354
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,330
Or is that the forefront of the fight?

355
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,530
I cannot wait to see the Hulk and the thing, like, brawl it out.

356
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,050
That's gonna be so fun.

357
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,670
He is my man.

358
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,990
It's clobbering time.

359
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:47,410
It's gonna be so fun seeing the Hulk, then the thing just fucking just fight it out in the center.

360
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:54,390
Um Okay, okay and then his other his outfit is the trench coat.

361
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,330
Alice, don't care anything big enough to fit a man of your size.

362
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,910
I love how he has a little camera too.

363
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,550
Um, here's the thing.

364
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,770
Let me know, but thank you for the super chat.

365
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,350
Thank you.

366
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:03,990
Thank you.

367
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,610
Okay, I think this is a cool.

368
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,830
I think this is cool.

369
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,430
I think this cosmetic is cool.

370
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,290
Oh my god.

371
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,170
He's so fucking cool.

372
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,770
But what does it look like without the shirt?

373
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,910
Oh, you can see the rocks too.

374
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,990
Bro got the trip.

375
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,080
How about this?

376
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,700
Whoa, noir scars.

377
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,170
Oh That's so fucking deep bro.

378
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,910
Oh, that's funny.

379
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,890
All right, rocky jab.

380
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,430
I mean, it's basically a fighting game.

381
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,410
This is another hero for fighting game players.

382
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:46,810
It's clobber.

383
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,530
Oh my god, it's clobbering time.

384
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,750
Oh shit.

385
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,570
Oh my god.

386
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,530
That's basically a rineshatter.

387
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,290
This is basically a rineshatter right there because you can see the stun and everything.

388
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,270
This is a doomfist charge, but then they go up instead.

389
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,450
Uh, so this is just the doomfist charge.

390
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,070
And there's the leap.

391
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,670
Jump towards your ally and apply damage reduction.

392
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,270
Oh, so like you get a little rock shield.

393
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,150
Oh my god, I don't know if I can play this guy.

394
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,750
I'm definitely gonna be throwing if I play.

395
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,730
A heavy blow.

396
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,830
Okay, that's a right click.

397
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,690
And what's my passive?

398
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:42,830
Immune to launch up, knockback, and other- oh wait, you can't get- you're- basically you can't get cc'd.

399
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,450
Oh, that's so cool.

400
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,080
You basically- it's basically Reinhardt, but like...

401
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,410
Reinhardt's wet dream.

402
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,530
It's his utopia.

403
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:59,650
All those Reinhardt players, you know, playing Reinhardt has always been like the worst thing ever.

404
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,910
Because you get cc'd to hell.

405
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:11,810
Like now, this is basically Reinhardt's fucking utopia where you can basically play Reinhardt with no cc.

406
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,230
Like, that's perfect.

407
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,470
My time has come.

408
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,130
Oh my god, it's finally here.

409
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,650
No, Wolverine?

410
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,710
Wait, that's true.

411
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,650
I wonder if Wolverine can kidnap him.

412
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,430
Oh my god, you can still sleep and freeze him.

413
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,470
That's true, but at least you don't get knocked back.

414
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,150
And launched up.

415
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,250
You know, 2 cc, like only 2 cc is alright.

416
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,790
What's causing fireball?

417
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,510
Oh, it's basically like picking up Hulk.

418
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,050
I wish you could pick up Raccoon and just throw him into the ocean.

419
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,550
The Raccoon will think that I'm here to help him and then I just chuck him off.

420
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,370
Oh,

421
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,330
the Wolverine can't kidnap him?

422
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,190
Oh my god, that's crazy.

423
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,530
Okay, apparently the Wolverine cannot kidnap him.

424
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,890
All right, let's go to- let's go to- I have to be level- I'm not gonna be level 10.

425
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,970
I'm not.

426
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,470
Let's go to the practice range real quick.

427
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,590
Oh, I wish you can.

428
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,430
I wish they do a team up where you can just- No, we don't need to know.

429
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,590
I wish we had a team up where I can just throw Raccoon into the fucking- all right.

430
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,170
Oh my god, wait.

431
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,090
Are my settings- oh, I forgot.

432
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,030
My settings reverted.

433
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,230
Guys, what was my sentence?

434
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,750
I posted in my description, guys.

435
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,930
I'm too lazy to pull- I can't pull up my description.

436
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:45,750
Guys, what's my- Someone look at my description real quick and tell me what it is.

437
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,590
Okay, 1.83.

438
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,130
I was like, oh, this is not my sentence.

439
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:50,930
Oh fuck.

440
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,430
I don't have my- I don't have my reticle too.

441
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,510
I can- I can do my reticle real quick.

442
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,850
It's gonna be like the most scuffed ass reticle.

443
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,010
I'll just do default.

444
00:27:59,710 --> 00:27:59,970
There we go.

445
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,670
That's fine.

446
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,510
It's really tiny though, but This is the best I could do.

447
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,290
Oh, reticle animation.

448
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,670
No animation, please.

449
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,770
I don't like animation on mines and I use green dot.

450
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:12,870
Do I use green or red?

451
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,130
No, I use green because I can see green better.

452
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,210
Um...

453
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,250
Oh my god, all right, this is awkward.

454
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,030
This is very awkward.

455
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,930
And then UI.

456
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,110
Uh, need healing.

457
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:28,610
Oops.

458
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,010
There we go, left control.

459
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,190
We don't have to go down as- Wait, but you're playing.

460
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,410
Guys, I don't need to go down.

461
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,830
I'll just look down.

462
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,790
That's how I'm gonna go down.

463
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,750
I'm just gonna look down.

464
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,510
Jesus Christ.

465
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:45,890
Okay.

466
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,130
All right.

467
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,430
Like how- oh yeah, you're right.

468
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:50,870
It is.

469
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,830
It's like a little four.

470
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,290
Okay.

471
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,590
How do- okay, I think this is it.

472
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,110
I just have to draw a square.

473
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,090
And then...

474
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,450
Oh, wait, can I draw?

475
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,230
Wait, guys, wait a minute.

476
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,550
Wait, I can draw anything.

477
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,250
Wait, how far can this go?

478
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:16,690
How- no!

479
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,260
It's too fast, guys.

480
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,640
It won't let me draw what I want to draw.

481
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,120
No!

482
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,420
I can't draw a peepee!

483
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,580
No!

484
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,440
At some point!

485
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,420
Oh, you're right.

486
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,420
You're fucking right.

487
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,300
I can do it fast.

488
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,240
Don't worry.

489
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,540
Don't worry.

490
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,020
If I do this fast enough...

491
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,980
If I do this fast enough...

492
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,000
Guys, it's not looking like a dog!

493
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,080
Guys, if this is your peepee, go see a doctor.

494
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,780
I'm kidding.

495
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,460
If this is what it looks like, you gotta go see a doctor.

496
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,200
Look, I drew a pentagon.

497
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,780
Wait, I'm trying to- I'm trying- okay.

498
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,060
Oh, fuck.

499
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,840
Okay, simple geometry.

500
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,260
Look at that!

501
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,420
Oh my god!

502
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,940
Let's- we did it!

503
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,080
Wait, no, I don't think I can draw a star.

504
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,200
I'm trying to.

505
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,300
That's what I've been trying to do.

506
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,520
I can't draw- no!

507
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,060
I can't do a star!

508
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,740
It's too fast!

509
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:52,120
All I can do is draw the- Wait, can I draw a four?

510
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,130
Guys, does this look like a four to you?

511
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,670
Okay, wait.

512
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,890
Wait, do I go- I don't think I can go fast enough.

513
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,350
Okay.

514
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,710
No, no, I can't- I can't go fast enough!

515
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,610
Does this look like a four, guys?

516
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:22,110
Guys, do you think that looks like a four, guys?

517
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,850
Do you think I did it?

518
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:30,290
Does it know what a four- Guys, do you think I did it, guys?

519
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,890
Okay, wait.

520
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,810
I'm gonna kill these people inside.

521
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,430
There we go.

522
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,230
There we- whoa!

523
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,050
And I can just be like that.

524
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,610
Wait, what is this?

525
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,690
This one was a dive, right?

526
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,690
Oh shit, yeah.

527
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:51,750
Okay, and then this is where- I forgot what my super- oh yeah, the tornado!

528
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,910
Yeah, that's the tornado.

529
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,170
Oh my god, that is scary.

530
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:56,750
Not gonna lie.

531
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,350
Imagine all those tornadoes in that one support.

532
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,230
How big of an area can it cover?

533
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:04,930
Let's try.

534
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,170
Oh shit, okay, pretty big.

535
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,150
Wait, but it's not hitting.

536
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,450
Oh!

537
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,190
Okay, okay, wait.

538
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,530
Let's see how big of an area I can make it.

539
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,210
This, by the way, was no ability cooldown.

540
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,470
Wait, but it's not hitting.

541
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,550
Okay, there we go.

542
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,110
Yeah, as long as I can do the shape.

543
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,870
But the thing is, I'm limited to three right now.

544
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,490
So that- I mean, I can still do that.

545
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,130
Look, I made a triangle.

546
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,630
Alright, so that's how you do it.

547
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,390
That's how you play- Um, that's how you play Johnny.

548
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,490
Okay, let's do- I did not need to go back to spawn to swap.

549
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,990
Uh, the thing is- What's the range?

550
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,750
Okay, oh my god.

551
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,390
Guys, look how far I am to Luna.

552
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,970
Oh my god.

553
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,530
Oh, what the fuck?

554
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:18,270
Wait.

555
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,650
Oh my god, wait, how far can I be?

556
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:28,310
Oh my- Oh my god, what is my hitbox?

557
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:28,730
Okay.

558
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,550
Okay, so- Okay, here you go.

559
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,070
This is- Okay, this is how far I can be to Luna.

560
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,170
This is just my left click, by the way.

561
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,510
This is actually just my- my left click.

562
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,370
You can't escape the clobbering time!

563
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,370
You can't escape me!

564
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,770
Damn, okay, wait.

565
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,270
Jesus Christ.

566
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,670
Oh, wait, it resets if you hit somebody.

567
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,470
Wait, okay, wait.

568
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,570
Okay, oh no, right click is infinite!

569
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,050
Oh no, right click is infinite!

570
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,530
Oh shit.

571
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,190
Okay, right click is infinite then.

572
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,870
There's no cooldown for it.

573
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,430
Okay, and then E is the shield.

574
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,970
Get behind me!

575
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,870
All right.

576
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,330
Is my cooldown settings off?

577
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,290
Nope, it's not.

578
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,430
It's still- I- right click actually has no cooldown.

579
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,330
Nope.

580
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,230
Yeah, it's- yeah, ability cooldown- wait, yeah.

581
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,350
Right click has no cooldown.

582
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,190
That's- that's scary, actually.

583
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,550
Whoa!

584
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,250
My ride went dream!

585
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,390
See?

586
00:34:59,630 --> 00:34:59,930
See?

587
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,730
Shift has a cooldown.

588
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,370
The right doesn't.

589
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,190
There you go.

590
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,290
And then the Q is the shatter.

591
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,370
Okay, so that's the range for it.

592
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,890
It doesn't go to the- but that also means, like...

593
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,710
How is this range?

594
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,150
Okay, so that's the range.

595
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,910
The Q is kind of slow, but I feel like it's more so of a surprise thing.

596
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,670
And then just be like...

597
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,410
CLOBBERING TIME!

598
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,210
CLOBBERING TIME!

599
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,870
The ship also cancels movement abilities on stomp?

600
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,210
Oh, that is scary.

601
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,690
I need to time it correctly.

602
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,470
Get back over here.

603
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,190
Get back.

604
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,310
Get back over here.

605
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,990
That's right, get your ass back in here.

606
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,490
Wait, how come I can't jump?

607
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,330
Why can't I jump?

608
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,690
Do I have to be like here?

609
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,270
Am I banned from- oh, I have- I can only jump if I'm next to an ally.

610
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,770
Ally.

611
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,910
Because I can't jump.

612
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,810
I'll have to look at the ally to be able to have the jump.

613
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,510
Oh, that's why.

614
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,730
Okay, that makes sense.

615
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,890
So here's the thing, in actual demo- demo don't try.

616
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,150
Thank you for the super chat.

617
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,530
Thank you.

618
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,570
Thank you, guys.

619
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,050
I can't jump unless I'm next to somebody.

620
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,710
All right, let's see.

621
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,050
How far is my jump though?

622
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,290
Okay, can I hold it?

623
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:27,530
If I hold it, will I- Okay, that's how far it is.

624
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,330
Guys, I'm not a good jumper.

625
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,450
Guys, guys.

626
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,850
I'm sorry.

627
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,430
Oh, I have to be on high ground.

628
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:39,870
Okay.

629
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,430
Guys, it's okay.

630
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,470
Okay, wait.

631
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,970
I have low mobility, but like how far can I jump from here?

632
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:46,970
All right.

633
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,290
Okay, that's fine.

634
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,250
Okay, if- if I am below you, you're fucked.

635
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,090
If I'm here, sorry, you're fucked.

636
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,390
I won't be able to make it.

637
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,450
I'm sorry.

638
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,170
I have to be at even level playing field with you.

639
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:15,830
I- I have to- don't worry, as long as I have the high ground, you'll be okay.

640
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,410
Okay.

641
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,390
The thing's biggest mortal enemy is stairs.

642
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:27,350
Don't worry, the moment I get the stairs, I will save you.

643
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,250
Take me down.

644
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,770
Thank you for the super chat.

645
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,290
Thank you.

646
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,050
Thank you.

647
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,710
I'm not tall enough.

648
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,090
Oh, Jesus Christ.

649
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,250
That's so much damage.

650
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,350
I'm a little scared because that looked like a lot of damage.

651
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:45,990
I have- I have the stairs, Anakin.

652
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,770
Don't worry.

653
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,610
I have the stairs.

654
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,410
That goomba stopped him.

655
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,250
Don't worry.

656
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,630
That's right.

657
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,270
Now that's a lot of damage.

658
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,430
All right.

659
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,330
All right, I guess we can do quick play.

660
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,490
Guys, I don't even know if I can- I'm gonna try to see if I can grab Johnny.

661
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,930
Uh, the human torch first.

662
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,550
I don't know if I can, but we'll try.

663
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:35,380
Absolutely destroyed by all the other streamers because like mostly it's streamers that- it's the streamers that have access to early access and in the moment I try to get the human torch, I'm gonna get absolutely destroyed by the enemy DPS player who's also on the human torch.

664
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,760
Oh shit, you're right.

665
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,880
Oh my god, that's right.

666
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,700
I have an assist.

667
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,820
My PC's faster.

668
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,180
My PC's just faster.

669
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,300
That's fucking right.

670
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,780
I have an SSD.

671
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,840
Get fucked.

672
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,960
That thank you hi-hat.

673
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,120
Wow, very impressive.

674
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,060
All right, we absolutely destroyed.

675
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,620
Okay, who am I playing against?

676
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,480
The faster SSD wins.

677
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,960
All right, okay.

678
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,580
Nobody I know.

679
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,180
Okay, that's good.

680
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,860
All right, I live gym lead.

681
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,200
I don't have descent because I have- I have to look down to fly down.

682
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,040
That's the only issue.

683
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,400
Because I'm always like, I'll never need descent because none of the supports have flying abilities.

684
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,120
So like it was never needed, but now I'm like, oh no.

685
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,820
Now that I have to fly, I have to look down.

686
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,940
My control- No, my control- my control is I need healing because that's more important to me.

687
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,840
My control is I need healing, guys.

688
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,280
I already fighted it.

689
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,860
Guys, this is- it's obviously more important, guys.

690
00:39:59,240 --> 00:39:59,900
How are we going?

691
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,300
Okay.

692
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,100
Guys, obviously.

693
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,480
What if I make a shape now?

694
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,060
It's getting hilarious.

695
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,940
Let's just make a shape now.

696
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,620
Oh fuck, okay, okay.

697
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
Make another shape.

698
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,280
Go!

699
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,360
Just keep making shapes.

700
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,580
Let's go.

701
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,860
Get over here.

702
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,120
I just- I made a shape, guys.

703
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,660
All right, there.

704
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,720
Nice.

705
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,060
I need to like learn how to do, uh...

706
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,240
Draw a big cat!

707
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:55,460
Guys, do- Do you think that PP was not the first thing I did, guys?

708
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,700
Do you really think I would not- I wouldn't do a PP first?

709
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:09,180
Do you really think- Of fucking course I would draw a fucking penis first.

710
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,920
That's what society has taught us for years.

711
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,360
All I can do is draw a fucking square.

712
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,240
That's all I can do.

713
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,940
I can't believe I drew a fucking triangle.

714
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,700
That's all I can do.

715
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,980
Draw a goddamn triangle.

716
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,180
It's okay, I can draw another triangle.

717
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:36,840
Wait, what?

718
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,020
What are you doing?

719
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,600
What are you goddamn doing?

720
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,460
Get out of here.

721
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,040
Get out of here.

722
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,040
Get out of here!

723
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm gonna draw another triangle!

724
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,880
That's right!

725
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,240
Look at that!

726
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,760
Get in that triangle!

727
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,060
Simple geometry!

728
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,240
That's right!

729
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,260
That's fucking right!

730
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,640
I'll even draw another triangle!

731
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,660
I can't.

732
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,280
I have to get closer to actually do stuff now.

733
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,660
I- Okay, that's fine.

734
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,240
You know what?

735
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,640
That's right!

736
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,500
Get in here!

737
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,940
Oh my god!

738
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,600
What's going on?

739
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,400
I can't tell!

740
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,430
Nice.

741
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,550
I'll even draw a triangle again.

742
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,810
That's right!

743
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,170
What you gonna do here?

744
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,210
There we go.

745
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:48,530
Oh man, this is- I don't know what's going on, but it seems bad.

746
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,110
Guys, support players are fucked right now.

747
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:57,010
Everyone died and you weren't even- I just threw tornadoes and we won.

748
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,030
That's just dirty.

749
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:00,890
God!

750
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,090
I finally can burn the trees!

751
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,970
Life is beautiful!

752
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,450
Finally, my dream comes true!

753
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,490
I can finally burn trees down!

754
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,910
Oh my god!

755
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:31,910
Guys, I need to figure out like- Um, what was my other- Oh, what is my C ability again?

756
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,770
Um, oh, it's uh, it's that.

757
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,170
Okay.

758
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,990
I was like, what am I doing?

759
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,250
All right, now that I know now.

760
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,170
Finally!

761
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,610
How bad can I be?

762
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,210
I'm just doing it naturally.

763
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,010
How bad- That's right!

764
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,550
Don't make me draw a square!

765
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,930
Because I will do it!

766
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,170
Oh, I fucking- I fucked up.

767
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,790
I was not aiming at the wall.

768
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,730
I was- I was aiming at the- I will draw a square too.

769
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,610
There we go, that's right!

770
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:10,490
Oh man.

771
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:11,810
Wait, what are we doing?

772
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:12,670
There we go.

773
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,230
Did we get it?

774
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,110
Oh shit, we did.

775
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:15,930
Oh shit!

776
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,490
Okay, that's fine.

777
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:21,670
What's going on?

778
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,750
I don't know, but it's working.

779
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,870
Burn the tree!

780
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,270
Nice.

781
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,030
Get over here.

782
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,550
Get over here.

783
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,430
I'm fucking heading over.

784
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,870
Oh, you're gonna fall.

785
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,070
You're gonna fall.

786
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:35,710
Oh, Freddy.

787
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,090
Oh, goodbye Freddy.

788
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:39,390
I'm gonna kick you Freddy.

789
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,590
Get that tree.

790
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,390
Oh, you won't like this.

791
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:47,950
That's right.

792
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:48,910
Step on it.

793
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:49,510
Come on.

794
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,490
I know you want to.

795
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,830
Don't you want to step on it?

796
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:54,850
Boom.

797
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:56,830
Come on.

798
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:58,970
Goodbye.

799
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,950
Don't make me make a shape.

800
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,250
I- I- I fucked up the shape.

801
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,230
Oh my god, okay, where- where did he go?

802
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,310
All right, we're going to spawn.

803
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,710
I have the real deal.

804
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:16,550
Oh, Freddy.

805
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,230
Oh, Freddy.

806
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,590
Oh shit.

807
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:20,850
Who is this?

808
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,430
You think I won't?

809
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,670
That's right.

810
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,670
Just for you.

811
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,650
That's crazy.

812
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,030
Oh shit.

813
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:37,850
Oh shit.

814
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:38,710
Oh shit.

815
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:39,990
He also has a tornado.

816
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,170
Oh my god.

817
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,710
He's trying to kill our Venom.

818
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,210
Don't worry.

819
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,450
I made a really tiny triangle.

820
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,010
Burn the trees down.

821
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:51,730
Guys, do not worry.

822
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,570
I literally made the tiniest triangle possible.

823
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,980
Here we go.

824
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,460
I don't know if it hit anybody, but like, it's the thought that counts, you know?

825
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,240
Are they all gonna be okay?

826
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,240
I don't think he is.

827
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,860
You can't arm me.

828
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,520
That's right.

829
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,500
Get out.

830
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,020
It's so tight.

831
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,460
It won't see it coming.

832
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,000
Exactly.

833
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,520
Exactly.

834
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,080
I think those are bots.

835
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,580
I don't think Irish Smash Web YouTube was a bot.

836
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,960
I don't think.

837
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,320
I don't think bots have YouTube names, guys.

838
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,760
I don't think.

839
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,320
I think they were just really bad.

840
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:02,470
Freddy might have been a bot, but I don't think the people with the YouTube name were bots.

841
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,590
I don't think.

842
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,770
Bot games are three real.

843
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,230
Two bots versus all bots.

844
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,110
Oh my god.

845
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:11,510
All right.

846
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,990
Okay, so we might have versed against bots.

847
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:15,570
I don't know.

848
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,550
I don't know, but like, that felt nice though.

849
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,110
That felt really nice.

850
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,670
You can't just call people bots.

851
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,790
That felt good though.

852
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,070
Freddy might have been a bot.

853
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,550
This guy might have been real.

854
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,610
This guy actually had damage.

855
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,670
He could have been real.

856
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,870
Not gonna lie.

857
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:45,170
If anything, I feel like this one was a real person because he was trying.

858
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,810
Yeah, yeah, that seemed right.

859
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:57,150
Whoever was playing Luna was a real per- I think was a real person because they put- gave me orb instantly.

860
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:01,730
And like, if you're smart, you would give the person that's in the air orb.

861
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:04,830
So, yeah.

862
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,830
I- I don't think they were bots though.

863
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:09,530
I think these are everybody that's testing it.

864
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,030
Oh, yeah, I have enough to buy skins.

865
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:17,950
I honestly like the default Johnny, but like the thing, the- his suit, I think is cool.

866
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,050
I think this is cool.

867
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,130
I could buy that now.

868
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,450
Because I don't get to keep it anyway.

869
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,370
Oh shit, wait!

870
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,310
Can I?

871
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,150
Oh, I can.

872
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,490
Okay.

873
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,530
You don't keep this, by the way, so I might as well spend it.

874
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,130
I legit- I don't keep- I don't keep the skin.

875
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,510
This, like, this is not my account, technically.

876
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,210
Technically, it's not even my account.

877
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,310
It's like early access account.

878
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:45,510
So like, we don't get to keep it after early access is over.

879
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,970
So I might as well just spend it.

880
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:56,030
Guys, I think I did too well, so now they're trying to find me real players.

881
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,630
No, no!

882
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,270
No!

883
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,770
I did too- I bullied too hard!

884
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:09,030
So now they're finding me real players!

885
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:11,670
Sofiiiir!

886
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,330
It's not real!

887
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,390
No!

888
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,950
The SBO!

889
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:18,950
DMMK!

890
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,310
No one's doing Doom Quest?!

891
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,630
Oh my god, somebody come in.

892
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,530
So I can start- so I can start playing tank and free for all.

893
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:31,350
This is like my second time being here.

894
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,250
Please, somebody come in.

895
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,390
I need to beep someone up.

896
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,590
That skin is beautiful.

897
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,970
I think I like- Oh!

898
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:41,110
Oh nice, I got in.

899
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,530
Oh my god.

900
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:46,270
I can't believe it.

901
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,710
Now they actually are trying to give me real people now.

902
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,190
Oh, yeah, I know these.

903
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,470
I know for sure some of these are real people.

904
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,410
Also, they're now giving you an option to- oh shit.

905
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,270
All right, I'm faster.

906
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,950
I have a faster SSD card than you.

907
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:17,870
There we go, that's right.

908
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:21,690
The better PC wins again.

909
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:27,150
We still haven't got like, uh, everyone's queuing.

910
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,710
Oh wait, is there the new map queue?

911
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:31,790
Oh shit, I was clearly not paying attention.

912
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,410
All right, we'll do the new map after this.

913
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,370
My solid state drive is fucking solid.

914
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,270
It's hella solid.

915
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,870
That's right, I'm fucking- I'm ready to beat someone up.

916
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,450
Oh my god, people know me?

917
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:46,730
I got famous.

918
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,870
Guys, guys, I'm wearing- no pictures, guys.

919
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,990
Only I can take pictures.

920
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,290
I have the camera here.

921
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:55,690
Oh, yeah, that's right.

922
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,950
I'm a rock star.

923
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,150
Next scene, thank you for the super chat.

924
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:01,050
Thank you, thank you.

925
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,170
Your laugh always brightens my day.

926
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,250
Thank you for the super chat.

927
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:05,270
Thank you.

928
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,650
Guys, no pictures.

929
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,250
I'm incognito right now.

930
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,890
Oh my god, the trench coat doesn't work.

931
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,990
How could this be?

932
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,350
Don't worry.

933
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,830
You guys gotta- you guys gotta get near me so I can jump to you.

934
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,790
Oh wait, three second cooldown?

935
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,910
Oh no, no, okay.

936
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:25,970
No, it's not.

937
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,090
Okay, I was gonna be like, there's no way.

938
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,030
You're gonna run?!

939
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,310
Oh no, wait.

940
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:34,970
Hello?

941
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,010
I swear they will.

942
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:38,390
Get in there.

943
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,810
Wait, why did our other support fucking DC?

944
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,970
Guys, I don't know if I'm meant to be a tank player, guys.

945
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,830
Guys, guys, I don't think I'm meant- guys, what happened to our other support?!

946
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,610
What happened to my- heal me!

947
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:58,730
Heal me!

948
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,550
Don't make me play an actual hero.

949
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,590
Oh my god.

950
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,530
Please, I'm just- I'm just hitting.

951
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,810
Please, this is all I'm doing.

952
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:21,430
Our entire- wait, our entire lineup is like three melee characters.

953
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,990
Why don't we- why are you Iron Fist and not Storm?!

954
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,350
Holy shit.

955
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,830
The guy is Iron Fist and not Storm.

956
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,490
I'm like, did you not- oh, I got you, Johnny!

957
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,130
How am I gonna hit a guy in the air?!

958
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:44,850
How am I- they're both in the air!

959
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,130
What do I do?!

960
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,570
What the fuck do I do?!

961
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:52,570
This is actually not fair.

962
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,190
Like- oh!

963
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,910
Like, they're both in the air!

964
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,600
What the fuck do I do?!

965
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,270
They're both in the air.

966
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:07,290
This is actually not fair.

967
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,950
Holy- Oh my god.

968
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:16,110
Not your problem!

969
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:17,610
Not your problem.

970
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:22,150
That point too.

971
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,850
I literally can't do anything against him.

972
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,210
Literally not your problem.

973
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:37,490
The only person I can beat up is like- The only person I can beat up is literally the other tanks.

974
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,830
Like, I can't do anything else.

975
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:41,770
Like, I'm just like, who else?

976
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:42,830
Who do I beat up?

977
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:45,050
Who do I punch?

978
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,030
Oh my god, I punched a guy in the sky!

979
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:49,710
Holy shit!

980
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:51,690
Oh my god!

981
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:01,110
I'm just looking at the DPS.

982
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,130
I'm like, what do I do?

983
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,470
You're just there!

984
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,610
Oh my god.

985
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,750
Guys, this is what I mean.

986
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:13,690
Okay.

987
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:15,450
All right.

988
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:15,710
Okay.

989
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,430
Now, I'll just run at the supports.

990
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,070
Okay, what?

991
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:25,950
What do I do when both DPS are in the sky?

992
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,070
Such is the life of a goblin.

993
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,490
Oh my god.

994
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:35,210
Okay.

995
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:35,510
Okay.

996
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,210
I'll run at the one support.

997
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,830
I can do this.

998
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:43,510
I'll charge into the one support and I'm just gonna be like-

999
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,690
This is it.

1000
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:53,470
This is the- this is it.

1001
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:54,710
Who's Japanese curry?

1002
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:56,850
I just know that it's food.

1003
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:02,410
Is he the number one captain of- what is he doing?

1004
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:07,690
Captain America didn't even receive any buffs or nerfs.

1005
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,050
What is he doing?

1006
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:19,950
He didn't even receive any buffs or nerfs and he's still playing Captain America.

1007
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,770
He got buffed?

1008
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:22,330
Wait, really?

1009
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,610
I should've read the patch notes more.

1010
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,610
I read the incomplete leak version.

1011
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:35,490
Guys, I read- Don't worry, I'm fucking- That's right!

1012
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,330
You can't- you think you can disappear forever?

1013
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,830
You gotta get out of invisibility soon to heal your team.

1014
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:43,950
You think I don't know that?

1015
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,410
Where are you?

1016
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:50,170
Where are you?

1017
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:51,830
Oh no.

1018
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,810
No, where is she?

1019
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,670
I wanted to fucking get her.

1020
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,230
Where did she go?

1021
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,950
I was trying to fight invis a woman.

1022
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,050
She disappeared.

1023
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:08,910
That bitch.

1024
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:13,930
That fucking whore.

1025
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:15,510
God damn it.

1026
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,470
I know what you did with them.

1027
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,710
Okay, okay.

1028
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,450
Get out of here.

1029
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:25,710
I'm gonna punch you.

1030
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,250
I'm gonna- oh, I'm running away.

1031
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:28,930
Sorry.

1032
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,530
Sorry, I'm running away.

1033
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,190
I'm sorry.

1034
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,050
Oh my god.

1035
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,450
Jesus Christ, he should not have anything.

1036
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,310
Jesus Christ.

1037
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:42,070
How are they still alive?

1038
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,390
Oh my god, what did I do?

1039
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:50,850
Oh, I got you.

1040
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:52,590
I'm coming for you.

1041
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,830
Where are you invis a woman?

1042
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,190
I'm just gonna crap cat point.

1043
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:00,530
Oh, no.

1044
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:01,310
Oh, no.

1045
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:02,830
I still got it.

1046
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,350
Fire's not gonna stop me.

1047
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:06,830
But that will.

1048
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:08,910
That's gonna stop me though.

1049
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:09,990
That's gonna- yep.

1050
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:10,950
That's gonna stop me.

1051
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,510
That's gonna stop me.

1052
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,330
Oh, I shark missed.

1053
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,030
I shark missed.

1054
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,050
Oh my god.

1055
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:24,110
It's okay.

1056
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:25,230
Guys, please.

1057
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:25,790
The point.

1058
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,950
Only has it.

1059
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,330
Only has Thor on point.

1060
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,350
Has one person on point.

1061
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:35,390
Are you all in the- oh, it's because the rest of our team is in the- is literally in the air.

1062
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:36,610
That makes sense.

1063
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,090
I was gonna be like, how?

1064
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,290
How is like none of you on point?

1065
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:48,770
And I realized it's literally because 80% of our team is in the air and not touching the point.

1066
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,330
That is very sad.

1067
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:56,870
That- Okay, but also incredibly funny.

1068
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:04,770
Literally, no one is on point because of that.

1069
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:06,930
Oh my god.

1070
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:08,730
Oh my god.

1071
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:13,570
I'm just- Oh my god.

1072
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,970
No, I wanted to get you!

1073
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,510
I wanted to get you!

1074
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,270
I almost got him!

1075
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,890
Oh no, the comp clobbering.

1076
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:29,290
The beatdown.

1077
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:35,050
Guys, why does- why is tank- why do you guys play tank?

1078
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,190
I don't understand.

1079
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,130
What is it about tanks?

1080
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,010
What is it?

1081
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:54,270
What the- Guys, what- I'll eventually hit you!

1082
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,170
That's it!

1083
00:58:58,550 --> 00:58:58,930
No!

1084
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,110
No, no, no, no, no.

1085
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,950
Oh my god, you whore.

1086
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,110
You actual whore.

1087
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:16,470
I'm gonna- I'm just gonna- I'm gonna- I don't care.

1088
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,590
I just want to punch you!

1089
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:26,990
Oh my god, they just walk away.

1090
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:32,310
Look, I'm just trying to do my job, guys.

1091
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:36,410
Don't resist.

1092
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:42,230
We play tank because no one else would.

1093
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,940
Well, you can't expect to win them all.

1094
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:49,920
My god.

1095
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,820
All right, guys.

1096
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,980
Now I know that I'm definitely not a tank player.

1097
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:06,660
It's- okay, like, you play the thing, and your opponent is literally Storm and Johnny.

1098
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,700
Like, I- I would swap.

1099
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,080
I would 100% just swap.

1100
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:16,460
I would not- I do not want to deal with that.

1101
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:27,080
I literally look up in the sky and feel like I'm getting a fly swatter out and just trying to, like, hit him with a fly swatter.

1102
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,340
You don't.

1103
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,080
Because my other DPS were not hitting the other fly.

1104
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,360
My other fly wasn't hitting the other fly.

1105
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,600
Like, there's so many we don't need anymore.

1106
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,240
Oh my god.

1107
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,360
I literally was just looking up like, what do I do?

1108
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,200
What do I do?

1109
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,140
I'm like, get down from there.

1110
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,640
I only swap targets when I found a fucking target that can't fly.

1111
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,740
Like, what do I do?

1112
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,820
He's just flying.

1113
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,100
He's just flying.

1114
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,580
What do I do?

1115
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:20,980
All right.

1116
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,920
Oh my god, am I fast enough?

1117
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,580
Oh no, this person's loading in faster.

1118
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,300
No, I haven't downloaded Central Park yet!

1119
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,440
No!

1120
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,260
It's still faster.

1121
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,660
So, so faster though.

1122
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,980
That easy.

1123
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,220
Haha.

1124
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,760
I know these people are real too.

1125
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,540
Passes hands in the west.

1126
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:58,430
Didn't download Central Park, still got here.

1127
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:02,090
Still managed to pick the character.

1128
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:08,410
All right, oh there's the cemetery.

1129
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:12,330
Oh yeah, so Blade is revealed here somewhere.

1130
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,030
Welcome to New York, the most depressing place in the world.

1131
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,090
In the Marvel Universe apparently.

1132
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,310
Where do I go?

1133
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,210
Oh, there it is.

1134
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:28,210
True.

1135
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,350
There's- who's that?

1136
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:36,630
Where's this- is this the- oh, this is the zone.

1137
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:40,250
Okay, I'm trying to figure out- oh my god, where am I?

1138
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:46,210
Yeah, but according to Marvel, this is what Central Park looks like.

1139
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,210
All right, I am ready to draw a square.

1140
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,300
Okay, clearly I'm not.

1141
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,800
Clearly I'm not ready to draw a circle.

1142
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:06,590
All right.

1143
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,160
That's right.

1144
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:16,780
Boom, boom.

1145
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,360
I'm literally just in the sky being annoying.

1146
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:28,300
That's right, stand in there.

1147
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:34,900
That's right, keep standing.

1148
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,520
What are they doing?

1149
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:38,560
Okay.

1150
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:45,370
That's right!

1151
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,870
Goodbye, supports.

1152
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:55,310
Goodbye.

1153
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,080
And then I'll make another square.

1154
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,480
It doesn't matter because like- wait, where did they go?

1155
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,780
Are they trying to go somewhere else this time?

1156
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,320
Oh my god, where are they going?

1157
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,960
I'm literally- time to make another square!

1158
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,260
Oh shit.

1159
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,460
Oh wait, they're over there.

1160
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,880
Oh my god, I could have made a square there.

1161
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,700
I could have made a square- wait, watch this.

1162
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,920
Okay, I got- guys, don't worry, I'm a hero.

1163
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,680
Guys, don't worry.

1164
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:39,520
I've got that one guy.

1165
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,400
I got the clone, guys.

1166
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,220
Do not worry.

1167
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,400
Okay.

1168
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,240
Okay.

1169
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,260
There we go.

1170
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,240
Triangle.

1171
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,020
What should I- goodbye.

1172
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,140
Goodbye.

1173
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,700
I mean, good try.

1174
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,480
Insane value.

1175
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,360
Oh my god, what a square.

1176
01:04:59,140 --> 01:04:59,440
Okay.

1177
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,620
Square!

1178
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:07,940
How do I go from Japanese Korean number one captain America to this?

1179
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,020
Like, how-

1180
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,920
I'm not even gonna have a chance to explore the rest of the map.

1181
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,680
Like, I can't believe it.

1182
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,500
I don't even get a chance to explore the rest of the map, guys.

1183
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,800
It's not fair.

1184
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,820
Get out of here.

1185
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:30,780
Why can't I- what?

1186
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,700
Don't worry, I'll make a shape.

1187
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,240
Keep you locked in.

1188
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,240
That's right.

1189
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:40,500
That's fucking right.

1190
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,760
Get over here.

1191
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,660
You can't get me.

1192
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,200
I'm literally in the sky.

1193
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,940
Wanna see?

1194
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,640
Bro, I know we wanna see the map.

1195
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,600
They're dying too fast for me to show you guys the map.

1196
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,880
Stop being such a gamer.

1197
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:05,380
Don't you make a cool- make a cool ass- Dude, fuck this.

1198
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,000
Bro, fuck this Loki in particular.

1199
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,020
Like- Fuck, guys.

1200
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,160
He's like, where do I go?

1201
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,900
Oh, you think- you think I won't make a fucking- watch this.

1202
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,340
That's right.

1203
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,140
That's right.

1204
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,140
There's a shape in there somewhere.

1205
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,280
The triangles are so fast.

1206
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,820
That's right.

1207
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,880
I have a shape in there, I think.

1208
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,000
That's right.

1209
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:36,560
Right there.

1210
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,900
That tiny ass triangle?

1211
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,600
That's my shape right there.

1212
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,020
I'm gonna make more.

1213
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,940
Fear the triangle, exactly.

1214
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:47,860
Okay.

1215
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,020
Don't worry.

1216
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,680
I'm gonna make more shapes soon.

1217
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,540
When I make sure I need to not die.

1218
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,280
Fear the tri- the tiny ass triangle!

1219
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,820
Wait, it worked!

1220
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,000
Wait, the triangle worked!

1221
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,520
My tiny triangle worked, guys!

1222
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,160
Did you see it?

1223
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:16,000
Oh my god, my tiny triangle worked!

1224
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,880
I knew it!

1225
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,200
I knew it worked, guys.

1226
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,520
I knew it.

1227
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,160
I don't have to do it.

1228
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,380
Now I know how they felt.

1229
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,580
Now I know how they felt when I was trying to play the thing against this.

1230
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:34,980
Oh my god.

1231
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,100
Don't worry.

1232
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,860
Fear the triangle.

1233
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,480
Your ass is not pushing to the point.

1234
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,860
How did I go from Japanese Korea to this?

1235
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,300
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

1236
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,020
Thank you.

1237
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:51,860
Thank you.

1238
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,360
What is this geometry?

1239
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:54,820
Geometry.

1240
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,240
See, map will save you in real life.

1241
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,140
What the fuck?

1242
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,760
I did more damage!

1243
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,580
I got his money back.

1244
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,060
All right, that's not fair.

1245
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:18,660
I love the early access peak to the spawn area of this map.

1246
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,740
It's not my fault!

1247
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,920
They couldn't get to the point!

1248
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,140
I tried!

1249
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,100
It's not my fault!

1250
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,960
I was on defense.

1251
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,900
You think I'm just gonna let them win?

1252
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,140
I was making triangles, chat!

1253
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,080
I wasn't even trying that hard.

1254
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,000
I was literally making shapes!

1255
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:58,760
I was just making shapes, guys.

1256
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:00,460
Please...

1257
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,220
Your all-out storm gets so many kills.

1258
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,120
You should have stopped ulting!

1259
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,580
I was ulting!

1260
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,680
I was just ulting one person!

1261
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,980
I saw one person.

1262
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,140
I was like, I'm gonna kill that one person.

1263
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,680
Try and escape this!

1264
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,700
She's just trying angles.

1265
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,620
Oh my god, the perfect view of the triangle.

1266
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,400
Duck, thank you for the super chat!

1267
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,420
Thank you, thank you!

1268
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,780
When Pythagoras was working on his theorem, bro was cooking something.

1269
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:41,160
Those triangles are OP!

1270
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,080
Thank you for the super chat!

1271
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,720
Thank you, thank you!

1272
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,320
Oh my god.

1273
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,920
That's actually, that's actually crazy.

1274
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,940
You know, the craziest thing is that like...

1275
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,600
Gamers don't look down or up, so...

1276
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:08,960
I feel like this is gonna like, this is gonna be like a huge, a skill diff when um, it's gonna reveal Which gamers are actually aware of their surroundings.

1277
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:33,980
Because the amount of times I walk into fire alone And like not even multiplayer video games too, like not even multiplayer games do I Do I like, I'm aware of my surroundings Because I walk in the fire all the time So there's gonna be like a huge like skill issue when the torch goes live

1278
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:42,080
I mean, I don't even, I walk into fires on non-multiplayer games!

1279
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:50,720
On games that like On games where the fire is even, is like ginormous on your screen and I still walk into it

1280
01:10:54,620 --> 01:11:07,140
So it's gonna be interesting to see like how many gamers don't actually, don't actually like look around Fire is map flavor dangerous?

1281
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:24,580
That's crazy, duh Oh my god I think the hardest, I hope eventually Um, there is a lineup of like tank supports and oh, especially when Ultron comes out Ultron is gonna be a support flyer.

1282
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:56,240
I hope eventually We're gonna get Enough heroes where we can build a team where they're all just flying characters I feel like, I don't know, I feel like that's gonna be fucking crazy Like a tank flyer We're gonna have an entire, we're gonna have an actual like air fight aerial battles and stuff Like we're gonna recreate Star Wars Yeah,

1283
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:04,800
Ultron got leaked as a support character Um, where he has like nanobots or whatever fucking Uh, like does like heroes and stuff.

1284
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,000
Hulk going to go swat, dragon ball fights

Do you know, uh Euclid's Elements was a geometry textbook written by a greek mathematician roughly 300 BCE That was all geometry knowledge until the 1800s when non-Euclidian Euclidian shapes were invented.

1296
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,240

That's not fair!

1383
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,510
He literally zoned me out!

1384
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:53,010
Oh my god and I'm trapped!

1385
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:59,670
I mean, I don't know if that was worth it, but... Bro, what the fuck?

1386
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:00,750
What do I do?

1387
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:00,850
No!

1388
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:03,410
Play!

1389
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:07,590
Get out of from the bridge!

1390
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:10,610
Oh god, there's too many.

1391
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:13,170
I'm gonna swatch you.

1392
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,150
Get out of here.

1393
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:23,220
Oh my god, can I get heal for that?

1394
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,500
Oh no.

1395
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,720
Oh, let me stand in that though.

1396
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:30,900
Let me stand in that.

1397
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,620
Let me feel safe.

1398
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,060
I feel so safe right now.

1399
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:40,720
Oh my god, that's fire.

1400
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,060
Oh my god, there's fire!

1401
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,340
Okay, don't!

1402
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,120
Okay, all right.

1403
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,860
I don't... They're all... Like, I basically got them out of the sky.

1404
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,840
I don't have to play sky characters and I don't have to swatch them.

1405
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:01,600
What the fuck?

1406
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,560
Oh, there's blade!

1407
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:02,920
There's blade!

1408
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,280
There he is!

1409
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:05,360
There he is!

1410
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,180
Where do I go?

1411
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,480
Oh, what?

1412
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,740
What the fuck?

1413
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,920
All right, we're figuring it out though.

1414
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,500
Oh my god, there he is!

1415
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:17,080
Is this mine?

1416
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:17,720
No.

1417
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,300
I'm sorry!

1418
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:22,620
Oh my god, there's a triangle!

1419
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,100
I have to make sure...

1420
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,020
I have to...

1421
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,900
Guys, where am I?

1422
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,200
Where am I?

1423
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,280
Oh, okay.

1424
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,270
He's just punching me!

1425
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:46,190
He's just punching me!

1426
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:47,770
You can do that?

1427
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:51,390
Please!

1428
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,350
Please heal me!

1429
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,040
Oh my god, I haven't played Psylocke in so long.

1430
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,980
Whoa, what?

1431
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,300
Hey, there's a hurricane.

1432
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,900
Oh, okay.

1433
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:13,760
Okay, my team's got Alistar's Distraction.

1434
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,500
It's okay, guys.

1435
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,760
My team's got it.

1436
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:20,260
Oh my god, I have not played Psylocke in so long.

1437
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,440
I forgot how to play her.

1438
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,140
We did it!

1439
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,900
Oh my god, we did it!

1440
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,800
We killed Dracula!

1441
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,700
We did it!

1442
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,630
I don't know either.

1443
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:41,370
I haven't played Psylocke in so long.

1444
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:42,870
I actually felt lost.

1445
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:46,590
I did not know what I was doing there.

1446
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:50,210
I was in the air for so long.

1447
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:53,090
I forgot what it was like to be on the ground.

1448
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:58,750
Dracula owes me money.

1449
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:00,610
Don't worry, I got you.

1450
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:02,150
I got you.

1451
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:04,270
I cast Black Triangle.

1452
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,250
Thank you for the magenta soup.

1453
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:07,930
Thank you, thank you.

1454
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,670
Is there new team-ups?

1455
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:12,410
I don't think there... Is there new?

1456
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:17,310
The new team-ups are only the Fantastic Four.

1457
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:18,770
Everything else is the same.

1458
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:19,910
See?

1459
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,190
The Atlas Bond is still here, chilling.

1460
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,290
Guardian Revival, Luna.

1461
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:26,450
Yeah, there's no new team-up.

1462
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,170
Gamma Charge.

1463
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:31,750
They nerfed some team-ups, though.

1464
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:35,290
It's just Fantastic Four and the Storming Ignition.

1465
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:37,850
They did rework some.

1466
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,610
I know they nerfed a bunch of team-ups, though.

1467
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:43,210
Yeah, and Fastball.

1468
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:47,390
So it's like these 1, 2, 3.

1469
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:49,470
These are the new team-ups right now.

1470
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:53,790
Yeah, but Fastball and everyone...

1471
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:55,970
I don't think it's that great, I'm not gonna lie.

1472
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:58,070
Just chuck Wolverine in there.

1473
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:03,570
The thing is, it's either you ban Storm and Johnny or you ban Wolverine.

1474
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,710
Cloak and Dagger and Moon Knight.

1475
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:11,690
They buffed this?

1476
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:13,310
Why'd they buff?

1477
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:18,050
Where Moon Knight can become invisible?

1478
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:22,870
Can inject light and dark energy to create light and Moon Knight.

1479
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:24,350
How'd they buff it?

1480
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,250
Oh, it heals now?

1481
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:29,230
It doesn't say it heals.

1482
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:33,710
Oh, it heals now.

1483
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:35,190
Oh, I didn't know that.

1484
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:37,230
It doesn't even say it on this.

1485
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,530
It doesn't tell you on this that it heals.

1486
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,910
Yeah, you won't even know.

1487
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:44,310
It doesn't even tell you on here.

1488
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,270
That's crazy.

1489
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:49,950
Maybe it tells you in his heroes?

1490
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:54,030
Let's see.

1491
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:55,770
No, it doesn't even tell you.

1492
01:24:57,870 --> 01:24:58,390
Yeah.

1493
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:02,230
It doesn't even tell you on his abilities that it heals himself.

1494
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:05,630
So you have to read the patch notes, I guess.

1495
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,130
So that's the thing.

1496
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:12,690
Guys, that's the thing.

1497
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:14,710
Alright, let's do another game.

1498
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,770
I want to play Johnny more.

1499
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:17,810
I think Johnny is really fun.

1500
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:19,070
Stop!

1501
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,470
I want to play Johnny more.

1502
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:27,470
Johnny is pretty fun.

1503
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,410
Look, I got the achievement.

1504
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:31,110
Zacona, thank you for the super chat.

1505
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:31,890
Thank you, thank you.

1506
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:33,150
I hope everyone is doing well.

1507
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:34,530
I bring bad news.

1508
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:39,990
I won't be able to tune as much anymore due to me absolutely slaying the interview.

1509
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:41,390
Thank you for the support last time.

1510
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:42,430
Did I make you proud?

1511
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:43,910
Oh my god, you got the job?

1512
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:45,770
Zacona, thank you for the super chat.

1513
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:47,050
Thank you, thank you.

1514
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:47,710
Congratulations.

1515
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:55,550
After trying to play the thing that one time, I realized it was not for me.

1516
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:56,290
I...

1517
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:04,670
I realized...

1518
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:09,950
I realized I was never meant to be a tank player.

1519
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:23,010
When I looked up in the sky and I see a human torch in the storm above me and then I was like, what do I do?

1520
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:29,030
What do I do?

1521
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:31,930
And I was like, it's not it.

1522
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,010
It's definitely not for me.

1523
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:37,150
I'd rather...

1524
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:40,490
I'd rather use the power of geometry.

1525
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:43,270
That one was much more fun.

1526
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:44,590
Using geometry.

1527
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:51,450
Well, you can hit people in the sky as Magneto and...

1528
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:53,370
like, as Magneto and Strange.

1529
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:56,550
I mean, and as Hulk, you can technically grab them.

1530
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:57,730
You can...

1531
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:58,990
You can take...

1532
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:00,730
Okay, you know what's...

1533
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:01,830
You know what's fucked?

1534
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:04,050
They nerfed Magneto...

1535
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:09,670
They're nerfing Magneto and Strange, but in the VTuber tournament, Betel...

1536
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:12,530
By the way, Betel is gonna be on day two.

1537
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:15,730
He can't play day one, but he'll be there for day two.

1538
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:20,270
Betel is a Magneto one trick.

1539
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:21,730
So...

1540
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:23,550
So...

1541
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:26,410
I don't know if he can pick up another tank.

1542
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:28,270
I don't...

1543
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:36,170
And they're nerfing Magneto.

1544
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:43,370
And then I was told that tank meta and day two is the finals too.

1545
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:49,790
Okay, and then I was told that Venom and Thor and Captain... It's gonna be dive meta.

1546
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:56,910
So it's Venom, Thor, and Captain America are gonna be like crazy good.

1547
01:27:57,270 --> 01:28:06,390
But then the two tank players I picked up are Strange and Magneto players because in my head I was like, Strange, Magneto, forever!

1548
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:10,610
I couldn't pick them.

1549
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:16,050
It was such a... I didn't realize I would be gambling in that, you know?

1550
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:18,530
I didn't know.

1551
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:19,770
I didn't know.

1552
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:23,230
I didn't know I'd be gambling in that.

1553
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:24,410
Like, I don't know.

1554
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:29,010
I was like, wow, when would Venom or Captain America or Thor ever be meta?

1555
01:28:29,650 --> 01:28:39,050
Apparently I was told that teams are now scrimming with Venom, Captain America, and Thor in preparation for the new season.

1556
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:41,030
And I was like, fuck!

1557
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:44,050
I was just like...

1558
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,520
characters in rank!

1559
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,560
No one plays those tanks in high elo!

1560
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,080
How would I know?

1561
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:01,920
No, Thor is not solid in high elo.

1562
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:08,420
If I see a Thor 1 trick, I be get flamed so hard in high elo, guys.

1563
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:15,120
But now everybody is like playing Thor right now in rank in preparation for the newer season because that's like in 2 days.

1564
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,740
Sorry, my nose was so stuffy.

1565
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:18,700
I had to blow my nose.

1566
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,060
Sorry, I had to blow my nose there.

1567
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:28,280
No, because there's like a couple of Thor 1 tricks in high elo and they always get flamed.

1568
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:38,380
They always get flamed and we would avoid it because people would be like be like, Wyatt, please play a Stranger or Magneto, please.

1569
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,680
And then like...

1570
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:43,920
But now, right now, everyone's playing Thor and Venom and Captain America.

1571
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,000
Japanese girl is so fucking lucky.

1572
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,840
Because dive is gonna be meta now.

1573
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,080
But like, if you told...

1574
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,360
Last week?

1575
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,780
Last week?

1576
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,380
Oh my god, there's so many.

1577
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,100
I would avoid every Thor 1 trick.

1578
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,740
Me and my... like, me and whoever I play with.

1579
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,940
They would always get flamed.

1580
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,980
So like, we're a little fucked right now because like, I don't know.

1581
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,540
Like, I don't know how we're gonna do.

1582
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:18,360
I was super confident earlier because I was like, nice.

1583
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:21,020
We have a strange player and we have a mag player.

1584
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,480
That's perfect.

1585
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:29,120
But now, because Venom's new ult, he like, pulls people in now.

1586
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,440
I don't know if it's like, activated.

1587
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:33,800
So when Venom ults, they usually send people vertically.

1588
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:37,560
But now when Venom ults, they pull them towards him.

1589
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:42,120
So like, that's really... that's why he's like, he's even scarier now.

1590
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,080
He's like, more...

1591
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,120
I'm not so... yeah, it's...

1592
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:49,180
Yeah, the slam.

1593
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:49,980
Sorry, the slam.

1594
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:51,940
The slam pulls people in.

1595
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,720
Okay, let me see if I can...

1596
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:54,700
Yeah, see?

1597
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,540
It pulled him in now.

1598
01:30:57,140 --> 01:31:01,440
So like, his like, his thing is so scary now.

1599
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:08,560
So it pulls people in and if you time it correctly, it pulls them towards me.

1600
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,400
And then his ult is actually... his ult is really good too.

1601
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,980
Yeah, that's... yeah, his dive pulls them in.

1602
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:19,700
So like, that's like, really good if you coordinate that with other... with other stuff.

1603
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,280
So that's why people are really scared now.

1604
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,880
That above Venom.

1605
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,140
And that's why he's becoming meta.

1606
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:33,340
So if you use... if you use Venom and Thor and you combine Venom and Thor together, like, they can kill people instantly with dive.

1607
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:39,380
I know Coney can play Venom, but I don't know if Meta can play Thor.

1608
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,760
That's what I'm worried about.

1609
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:58,180
But like, we might not... we might not have to play meta.

1610
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,140
We might not have to play meta.

1611
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:04,400
Depending on the team we play against, we might not have to play meta.

1612
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,760
Like, we could maybe be able to get away with it.

1613
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,280
But like, but we...

1614
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:09,900
I don't know.

1615
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:11,500
I don't know.

1616
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,660
We'll find out.

1617
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:14,380
We'll find out.

1618
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,260
We're scrimming...

1619
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:16,800
We're gonna be scrimming this week.

1620
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,180
So we're gonna find out and see how it goes.

1621
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:20,180
See...

1622
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,040
Alright.

1623
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:30,340
Yeah, I might ask them if they could try practice Thor and Venom.

1624
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:34,400
But yeah, that's like one of the biggest changes as to why he's meta at the moment.

1625
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:43,620
It's like Venom... so meta's gonna be like Venom, Captain America, Thor, Johnny... sorry, Human Torch.

1626
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,200
I always call him... I know him by first name basis, guys.

1627
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,220
I'm in the early axis.

1628
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:54,560
What... what Johnny and I have is special, guys.

1629
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:56,360
Cause I'm in the early axis.

1630
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:07,810
Me and my best friend.

1631
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:08,950
What?

1632
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:11,330
Yeah, me and my best friend.

1633
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:13,230
Johnny...

1634
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,130
Johnny Test.

1635
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:15,850
Sorry.

1636
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:17,430
Wait, it was Johnny Storm.

1637
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:19,350
Fuck.

1638
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,190
What if I just leave?

1639
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:24,170
What if I just leave?

1640
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:27,730
Fuck.

1641
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:29,530
I've waited so long.

1642
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:31,810
Probably the entire Fantastic Four.

1643
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:35,190
What?

1644
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:39,810
Johnny Bravo.

1645
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:40,790
No!

1646
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,190
It's not fair!

1647
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:50,250
I heard Mantis is gonna be meta.

1648
01:33:50,690 --> 01:33:53,790
Supports is gonna be Mantis something.

1649
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:56,390
I was told Mantis is gonna be meta again.

1650
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:57,230
And Adam.

1651
01:33:57,310 --> 01:33:57,930
Maybe Adam?

1652
01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:00,030
Adam is crazy now.

1653
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:02,790
Wait, what?

1654
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:04,790
Yes!

1655
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:07,210
We only have one healer.

1656
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:07,890
That's okay.

1657
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:12,730
Oh my god, let's fucking go.

1658
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:15,610
Oh my god.

1659
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:16,790
Let's go.

1660
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:17,830
That's right.

1661
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:19,990
I deserve this.

1662
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:20,850
I'm the big...

1663
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:21,690
No, I shouldn't say that.

1664
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:26,070
I deserve this.

1665
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:28,590
I don't know.

1666
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:31,430
Luna is all... seems pretty... Luna could be still meta.

1667
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:33,330
It's time to make a triangle!

1668
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:36,390
The strongest shape in the world.

1669
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:38,210
Okay.

1670
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:39,550
Can I break this?

1671
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:42,310
Oh wait, that's not what I wanted to do.

1672
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:45,770
Woah!

1673
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:47,430
He wants to do the combo.

1674
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:51,250
No, I'm gonna kill one guy.

1675
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:54,410
I'm gonna do it.

1676
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,050
Don't worry!

1677
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:57,890
The triangle!

1678
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:58,290
The triangle!

1679
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:02,190
I love fucking doing the triangle.

1680
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:02,810
I'm sorry.

1681
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:04,390
It's so dumb.

1682
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:07,630
The triangle has to be the dumbest shit ever.

1683
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:10,070
I did it!

1684
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:13,270
I fucking made a triangle.

1685
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:17,330
I fucking did it.

1686
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:19,530
The course of the Pythagoras theorem.

1687
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:23,850
What is he doing?

1688
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:26,030
Does he not know I made...

1689
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:27,510
What the fuck did I make?

1690
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:32,110
What did I make?

1691
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:33,290
Not gonna lie.

1692
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,590
I don't even know.

1693
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:38,270
I mean, it just doesn't help that we have one healer.

1694
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:39,810
Like, this is...

1695
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:41,810
This is a little awkward, not gonna lie.

1696
01:35:42,730 --> 01:35:46,150
All I'm thinking is like there's no point in like...

1697
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:48,190
Oh, I made a line!

1698
01:35:49,230 --> 01:35:50,310
That's what I made.

1699
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:55,110
Oh, I killed him.

1700
01:35:58,910 --> 01:35:59,830
There we go.

1701
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:05,450
Where is he?

1702
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:08,810
Get out of here.

1703
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:10,670
Alright.

1704
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:13,970
Where is the heal?

1705
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:16,050
Don't worry, sister!

1706
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:18,410
Didn't even need a...

1707
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:19,490
They didn't even see me.

1708
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:21,110
I literally was just...

1709
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:23,010
Where is he?

1710
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:24,510
Where did he go?

1711
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,130
I don't even remember I don't have to reload.

1712
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:29,130
It's so weird.

1713
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:31,410
I realized I don't have to reload.

1714
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:33,010
Oh.

1715
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:34,670
Don't worry.

1716
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:37,790
I can make a triangle here.

1717
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:42,270
The scariest shape of them all.

1718
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:42,990
Wow!

1719
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:43,790
What?

1720
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:47,790
I got backshotted!

1721
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:49,470
Holy shit!

1722
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:50,330
Okay.

1723
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:52,750
I was like, what?

1724
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:55,210
Where is he behind?

1725
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:59,090
He got literally fucking shot in the back.

1726
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:00,510
Okay.

1727
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:09,940
Please.

1728
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:10,880
Please hurry up.

1729
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:11,700
Please hurry up.

1730
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,380
He's gonna kill me.

1731
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,340
Because we don't have fucking...

1732
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:17,920
Oh my god, thank god.

1733
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,340
Thank god.

1734
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,960
I was not getting killed.

1735
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:22,900
I was so scared.

1736
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,980
So scared.

1737
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:28,340
I'm not...

1738
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:29,000
Whoa.

1739
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:29,940
Whoa.

1740
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:31,740
Wow.

1741
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,740
I'm not used to using health packs.

1742
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,260
Oh my god.

1743
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,100
Wow.

1744
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,020
I flew up.

1745
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:40,840
He couldn't get me.

1746
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:44,740
He's trying to kill me.

1747
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,080
I just flew up.

1748
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,460
That's crazy.

1749
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,400
Did you see that?

1750
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:51,720
He actually tried to solo ult me.

1751
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,640
And I literally just flew up.

1752
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:55,800
What are you gonna do?

1753
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,820
What are you fucking gonna do?

1754
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:04,620
Holy fuck.

1755
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:05,900
That worked.

1756
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,840
I literally just fly up.

1757
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,180
Like it's clobbering time.

1758
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,600
Now I'm...

1759
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,400
Watch this.

1760
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:18,020
The smallest triangle in the world.

1761
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:19,940
Oh shit.

1762
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:23,940
If I stay in the sky he can't kill me.

1763
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:25,620
We already capped it.

1764
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:26,680
Like what do you want?

1765
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,080
We literally capped it.

1766
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:33,380
The smallest triangle in the world.

1767
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:37,490
Okay.

1768
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:39,530
You have to.

1769
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:41,150
That's right.

1770
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:41,930
Oh shit.

1771
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:43,650
I don't wanna get hit by that.

1772
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:47,090
I'm gonna use your shield to heal apparently.

1773
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:48,010
Triangle!

1774
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:51,610
That's right!

1775
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:54,550
Get triangle!

1776
01:38:57,530 --> 01:38:58,910
Oh you missed!

1777
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:01,950
That's right!

1778
01:39:03,010 --> 01:39:04,190
Wait there's somebody over here.

1779
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:06,130
Wait can I...

1780
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:07,770
Oh you got him.

1781
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:10,230
Don't worry we have a...

1782
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:12,630
The strongest shape in the world.

1783
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:14,330
The fucking triangle.

1784
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:15,530
Watch this.

1785
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:17,150
Triangle!

1786
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:24,270
Guys we have...

1787
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:27,020
Use it!

1788
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,420
I have so many fire for you!

1789
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,080
Look at all the fire!

1790
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:37,740
Just keep fire!

1791
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:40,740
Okay well he has born again so I don't know what to do now.

1792
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:42,620
Whoops.

1793
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,380
What do you do when he does born again?

1794
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,080
Don't worry.

1795
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,320
Don't worry triangle time.

1796
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:56,300
The smallest triangle and oh my god he's here for his money.

1797
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,340
Hahaha!

1798
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:00,820
That's right.

1799
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:02,260
Can't do anything.

1800
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,400
Oh shit!

1801
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,620
He's pulling me back in there!

1802
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:09,860
Oh my god I thought I was fucking done for.

1803
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:11,720
Oh no.

1804
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:14,220
No my sister is dead.

1805
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:15,960
Triangle.

1806
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,560
I made a line instead.

1807
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,940
I need to stop making lines.

1808
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:24,000
I need to stop making lines.

1809
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,140
I made a fucking line.

1810
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:27,480
Okay.

1811
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:30,880
Surely I'm gonna get healed here right?

1812
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,620
Don't worry he doesn't see me.

1813
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:35,620
I made a line.

1814
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:35,780
I made a line.

1815
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:39,340
Don't worry.

1816
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,860
Surely I'm gonna get...

1817
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:44,720
Surely I'm gonna get healed here right?

1818
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,040
Surely.

1819
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,740
Oh my god thank god.

1820
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:49,960
Thank you.

1821
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,040
I also made another triangle.

1822
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:54,660
That's all I could do.

1823
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,360
Jesus Christ.

1824
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,680
It's fine.

1825
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:05,560
Wait what if I just...

1826
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,140
What the fuck?

1827
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:08,520
You're fucking crazy.

1828
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:09,480
Holy shit.

1829
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:11,900
Just stay in the air.

1830
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:13,840
You can't do anything if I'm in the air.

1831
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:16,280
That's how it goes right?

1832
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,100
Oh my shield's gone.

1833
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,020
Stop it.

1834
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:23,900
They have double support.

1835
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,040
Oh we have double support.

1836
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:25,960
Nice.

1837
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:27,760
Oh he doesn't know.

1838
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:29,520
Triangle.

1839
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:31,360
That's right.

1840
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,620
Be afraid.

1841
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:36,500
Be afraid of the triangle.

1842
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,460
Oh fuck.

1843
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,360
Oh fuck.

1844
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:45,800
That's so unlucky.

1845
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:53,100
That's like so unlucky.

1846
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,240
Okay.

1847
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:03,690
He's not gonna swap me.

1848
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:05,790
He's not gonna do jack shit.

1849
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:08,710
I have another triangle.

1850
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:10,330
That's right.

1851
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:13,250
I have so many triangles.

1852
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:15,190
Okay.

1853
01:42:17,550 --> 01:42:21,370
I'll keep making shapes until I die.

1854
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:22,750
Oh fuck I'm dead.

1855
01:42:27,410 --> 01:42:30,050
I didn't expect that to happen.

1856
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:31,110
I can't.

1857
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:35,610
When I said until I die I didn't realize I'd actually die.

1858
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:36,710
I can't.

1859
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:40,350
I wasn't thinking back was a possibility.

1860
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:43,670
Don't worry.

1861
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:46,570
Don't worry I'm close to another ult.

1862
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:52,950
When I said until I die how was I supposed to know I would actually die?

1863
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:56,750
Guys how the fuck was I supposed to know that?

1864
01:42:57,510 --> 01:43:00,590
Like the fuck?

1865
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:02,950
You're just standing in my fire.

1866
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:06,090
Oh I can make another.

1867
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:11,660
I'll have to wait.

1868
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:15,460
What?

1869
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:16,520
Oh my god!

1870
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,820
He was above me!

1871
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,480
Holy shit don't look up!

1872
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:24,600
Cameron don't look up.

1873
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:25,900
Oh my god!

1874
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,480
He was taller than me!

1875
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:35,600
How was I supposed to know he was taller than me?

1876
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:40,260
I thought I was the highest!

1877
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:44,140
I thought I was the tallest of them all!

1878
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,740
What the fuck?

1879
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,760
Okay I was not expecting that.

1880
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:51,200
Oh shit.

1881
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:52,460
Oh shit.

1882
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,600
Okay.

1883
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:00,220
Alright.

1884
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,220
Oh my god!

1885
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,840
Holy shit!

1886
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:18,720
I don't know how many fucking fires that... Jesus Christ!

1887
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,660
This is a lot.

1888
01:44:28,350 --> 01:44:29,550
This is stupid.

1889
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:30,570
This is so stupid.

1890
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:41,350
This is so stupid.

1891
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:42,630
I'm sorry.

1892
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:44,930
Okay.

1893
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:47,890
Don't worry!

1894
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:49,910
A square!

1895
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:52,130
That's right!

1896
01:44:52,170 --> 01:44:53,310
Don't come in here!

1897
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:54,750
I made a square!

1898
01:44:57,310 --> 01:45:00,810
The animal is upping my KDA!

1899
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:02,850
It really is!

1900
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:04,650
Oh my god!

1901
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:08,430
I just shot in the middle of the animal!

1902
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:13,630
The squirrel!

1903
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:15,990
My beautiful squirrel!

1904
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:17,590
I did it guys!

1905
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:19,770
I created the square!

1906
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:23,490
I fucking did it!

1907
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:26,230
Oh my god!

1908
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:28,270
The rare square!

1909
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:30,930
We did it!

1910
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:38,350
I can finally... I stopped making lines and triangles.

1911
01:45:38,710 --> 01:45:41,290
I finally made a square.

1912
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:44,410
Oh my god I've evolved.

1913
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:45,810
That was fun though!

1914
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:48,730
That was really fun testing out the new characters.

1915
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:51,370
I feel like that's the only time you'll ever see me.

1916
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:55,270
I'm not going back to support jail.

1917
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:59,910
I'll show you guys my main account before we end it here.

1918
01:46:00,190 --> 01:46:03,810
I'll show you guys the main before we end it.

1919
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:09,670
Doki and the other human torch be like 5'11 guys versus 6 feet guys.

1920
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:11,830
Thank you for the super chat.

1921
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:12,210
Thank you.

1922
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:14,370
Oh my god.

1923
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:22,710
Yesterday I was playing ranked because I was trying to see... Okay so I'm going to see if I can end my top 500 this season.

1924
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:23,770
The half season.

1925
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:30,150
But I'm not like super like... I'm going to fucking waste my time on it.

1926
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:33,610
Because I tried it yesterday in the 3-4 stack.

1927
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:36,830
I got to eternity 100.

1928
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:40,710
And then I was like Oh my god why can't I launch it?

1929
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:41,470
Where's my launcher?

1930
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:44,130
Where did it go?

1931
01:46:45,390 --> 01:46:50,890
But like people had to go because you know it was too late.

1932
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:56,670
So I told them I was like if I can't get it today it's over.

1933
01:46:56,930 --> 01:46:58,350
Like I don't care that much.

1934
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:04,490
Because the reason why I don't care that much is because the crest is so fucking tiny.

1935
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:08,230
You can only equip one crest.

1936
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:10,890
One top 500 crest.

1937
01:47:11,410 --> 01:47:16,130
And like I'm already on the leaderboard for season 0.

1938
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:21,950
By the way we have records now for season 0.

1939
01:47:22,930 --> 01:47:25,170
And you can thank me.

1940
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:26,990
I'm going to take credit for it.

1941
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:32,890
Because I was hard complaining about it to people who have connections to like the dev team.

1942
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:35,170
And then I was like tell them to add it in!

1943
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:41,570
I legitimately told one of my friends who has connections to the dev team to be like you should tell them to add it in because there's no point.

1944
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:48,530
And then like the dev actually thanked the person to be like oh my god like thanks for your suggestion.

1945
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:51,550
We had like a lot of people.

1946
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:55,330
We had like such a positive response to like adding the leaderboard.

1947
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:57,910
So like I would like to take credit.

1948
01:47:58,210 --> 01:48:10,910
I don't know if it was actually me but like they thanked my friend so I would like to think that I should take credit for it.

1949
01:48:13,010 --> 01:48:19,450
Because I'll be disappearing for a second because my game crashed.

1950
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:20,570
It's really dumb.

1951
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:22,610
Every time my game crashed I have to like restart.

1952
01:48:22,910 --> 01:48:24,890
I have to change, swap back to my account.

1953
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:28,030
Because I was like what's the point?

1954
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:33,710
I was like what's the point of being on top 500 if it doesn't show your previous records?

1955
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:36,350
Because at first they had zero plans on adding it.

1956
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:46,730
They had zero plans on adding the the top 500 like record leaderboards like previous leaderboards for like previous seasons and I was like what's the point?

1957
01:48:53,810 --> 01:48:56,650
So I like to think that complaining works.

1958
01:48:57,890 --> 01:49:05,410
I like I like to think that because I complained it worked.

1959
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:07,630
Alright, don't worry I'm coming back.

1960
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:08,730
Boop.

1961
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:09,790
I should be back soon.

1962
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:12,250
I'm not dead.

1963
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:13,210
I'm right here.

1964
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:14,850
I'm gonna take a little break.

1965
01:49:18,530 --> 01:49:19,670
So I'll show you guys.

1966
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:28,090
Alright, so bup bup bup Alright Let's see, I hope it works.

1967
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:30,410
I hate it when it does that.

1968
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:38,270
When like, um, if I like for some reason I have to always like, I have to change technically change my Steam account.

1969
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:42,230
I have to log out of my Steam account and log back in and stuff.

1970
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:49,510
Let's see Alright So yeah Here he is.

1971
01:49:49,950 --> 01:49:51,830
Oh, not here.

1972
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:52,630
Wait.

1973
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:54,550
Here it is.

1974
01:49:55,110 --> 01:49:58,270
I'm at tourney 94 right now.

1975
01:49:58,310 --> 01:49:59,930
That's my current rank.

1976
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:06,980
So the reason why I'm like do I do it?

1977
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:14,740
Is because if you get top 500 in season 1 you get a badge that's a little bit longer.

1978
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:23,320
So this is the badge you get.

1979
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:25,920
It is a little bit longer.

1980
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:31,800
I would admit that badge looks a little... Okay, I'm gonna test this out.

1981
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,040
I need to know if it is.

1982
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:37,120
Like, I need to compare the length size of this.

1983
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:39,540
Like, it looks a little longer.

1984
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:40,940
I think.

1985
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:42,080
Is it a little longer?

1986
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:42,860
I can't...

1987
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,260
Okay, wait.

1988
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:43,780
Don't worry.

1989
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:44,580
Don't worry.

1990
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:46,620
I got the comparison image right here.

1991
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,200
I got it.

1992
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:48,940
Okay.

1993
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,020
Okay.

1994
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,420
Wait, obviously Wait, okay.

1995
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:52,940
Reset.

1996
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:54,320
Yeah!

1997
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:55,460
It's a little longer.

1998
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:56,500
Wait, is it thicker too?

1999
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:01,620
Okay.

2000
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:02,740
I think...

2001
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,640
Or is it... Am I like... Okay, wait.

2002
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:08,080
No, it's the same size, right?

2003
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:09,840
No, it's the same size.

2004
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:11,940
It's the symbol that makes it a little longer.

2005
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:17,060
It's just camera angles.

2006
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:20,220
It's camera angles that make it a little longer.

2007
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:22,060
What's the same?

2008
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,440
It's the exact same.

2009
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:26,240
Okay.

2010
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:27,940
It was not.

2011
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:29,400
It was all an illusion.

2012
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:30,340
Okay.

2013
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:35,140
That's why I'm not like super into getting it because I was like...

2014
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:37,120
I was like, I don't know.

2015
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:39,000
It doesn't seem like...

2016
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,460
Because this is where it is.

2017
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:41,360
You guys didn't know.

2018
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,140
This is...

2019
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:47,700
This is where it is for those who don't know.

2020
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:52,080
So whenever someone cues in, you see this tiny little thing.

2021
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:59,460
So, this one looks like with a magnifying glass to be like, what does that look like?

2022
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,440
And this is what it actually looks like.

2023
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:03,640
Where is it?

2024
01:52:03,860 --> 01:52:04,520
Oh, sorry.

2025
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,300
It's right here.

2026
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:11,120
Thank you for the Akasupa, Nick.

2027
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:12,100
Thank you.

2028
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:12,840
Thank you.

2029
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:13,460
Sorry.

2030
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:14,560
Do you see my mouse?

2031
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:17,580
My mouse covers 50% of it.

2032
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:28,500
If I put my mouse here, if I put my cursor here, you might not be able to see it.

2033
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:29,700
No, they do not stack.

2034
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:32,680
You actually just swap it.

2035
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,780
They do not stack.

2036
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
You just...

2037
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,120
That's more like...

2038
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:41,180
It's just you swap your badge later.

2039
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:47,080
So, yeah.

2040
01:52:49,740 --> 01:52:52,560
Yeah, I need two cursors to hold it.

2041
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,300
Anyway, so there's that.

2042
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,240
That's basically the top 500 badge.

2043
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:02,880
And the new one above all crest is animated?

2044
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:04,240
No, it's not.

2045
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:05,340
Is it?

2046
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:06,140
Who cares?

2047
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:08,660
This tiny little thing's gonna be animated?

2048
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:09,200
Wow.

2049
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:16,520
It's like seeing a little ant dancing.

2050
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,420
It's like, do you understand?

2051
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:22,560
This tiny little thing is gonna start dancing.

2052
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:25,240
And I'm like, I'm too scared to dance.

2053
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:26,140
Alright.

2054
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:31,180
It's the ocean.

2055
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:32,660
The banner ocean.

2056
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:36,520
Hell, it has a good personality though.

2057
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:38,240
Thank you for the super chat.

2058
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,120
Hell, thank you.

2059
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:39,580
Thank you.

2060
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:43,500
ShiroDoki, I believe that's totally six inches.

2061
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,840
Osni, thank you for the super chat.

2062
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:46,440
Thank you.

2063
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:49,000
So, yeah.

2064
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:49,700
But hey!

2065
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:51,100
Okay, so...

2066
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:54,980
It's 143, so I'm actually super close to...

2067
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:56,480
So I literally need...

2068
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,140
We think safe is...

2069
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:03,120
We think safe would be like 190.

2070
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:05,560
Honestly, 180.

2071
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,600
180 would be safe.

2072
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:09,520
So like...

2073
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:10,880
Technically, yeah.

2074
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,560
180 would be... I don't know.

2075
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:15,060
160 would be... I think 160 actually.

2076
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:16,880
Because we only have like two days left.

2077
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:18,580
So it's either... I think...

2078
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:21,380
I think 180 would be safe.

2079
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:22,940
And then...

2080
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:26,460
Yeah, I think so.

2081
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,080
Because it's climbing not that fast.

2082
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:29,960
It's not climbing super fast.

2083
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:32,180
So I literally just need like three wins or something.

2084
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:38,390
So if I can't do it today, I'm not gonna do it.

2085
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:39,970
It's not worth it.

2086
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:43,030
Like I said, I already got top 500 here.

2087
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:46,570
I already got it here, so I'm not that desperate.

2088
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:55,410
I'm not that desperate because I already got it here in season zero.

2089
01:54:55,530 --> 01:54:57,970
So for season one, I don't care as much.

2090
01:54:58,170 --> 01:55:02,090
So I said like, if we don't get it today, I'm not fucking doing... I'm not trying.

2091
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:05,330
Like, I can't stack it!

2092
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:06,610
What's the point?

2093
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:08,810
I have one badge.

2094
01:55:09,190 --> 01:55:09,990
What's the point?

2095
01:55:10,030 --> 01:55:11,870
I can't even stack this.

2096
01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:13,750
It's like, I can't...

2097
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:16,270
My fucking cursor covers...

2098
01:55:16,270 --> 01:55:18,310
My cursor covers like 70% of this!

2099
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:23,090
I literally can't cover this with my cursor.

2100
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:31,210
You have two badges that I can't wear at the same time.

2101
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:34,650
Who's gonna notice the difference?

2102
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:36,250
They just notice the color.

2103
01:55:41,110 --> 01:55:42,550
Complaining works.

2104
01:55:42,550 --> 01:55:42,970
Like...

2105
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:46,870
Oh my god.

2106
01:55:46,930 --> 01:55:47,810
It's not...

2107
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:50,870
It's not something to be ashamed of.

2108
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:52,750
Anyway, so yeah.

2109
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:56,170
That's basically my current account so far.

2110
01:55:56,570 --> 01:55:57,190
Hey guys!

2111
01:55:57,610 --> 01:55:58,430
I'm gonna call it here.

2112
01:55:58,850 --> 01:56:00,230
Let's start streaming today.

2113
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:01,430
I need to rest, obviously.

2114
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:03,110
Like, I'm not doing so well.

2115
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:05,970
I am not doing so well.

2116
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:12,310
Before I end it here, I'm gonna show a little bit because we have three days left!

2117
01:56:12,770 --> 01:56:16,230
Till the pajamas collection ends!

2118
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:17,730
You don't have to buy just the pajamas.

2119
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:20,170
You can just buy the eye masks if you're just interested in the eye masks.

2120
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:25,370
So please, check out the GinaDraws website for a special collection!

2121
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:28,130
Because we have three days left to order!

2122
01:56:30,070 --> 01:56:31,290
So please check it out!

2123
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:39,510
The more orders we can get, the more stuff we can make later on because each order basically helps us figure out like, you know.

2124
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:44,570
I posted in the chat so please, check it out!

2125
01:56:45,650 --> 01:56:49,150
The more orders we get, the more we can do in the future.

2126
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:52,970
It really does help out a lot and you get a little freebie sticker too!

2127
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:54,950
So yeah, check it out guys!

2128
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:55,690
Check it out!

2129
01:56:55,990 --> 01:56:57,850
Only three days left to order!

2130
01:56:58,130 --> 01:57:00,910
If you can, you don't have to buy just buy everything.

2131
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:04,230
You can just buy the eye mask itself which I think is really cute as well.

2132
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:05,730
But thank you everybody!

2133
01:57:05,730 --> 01:57:07,950
I hope you guys enjoyed today's stream.

2134
01:57:08,150 --> 01:57:09,350
I'm going to rest my voice.

2135
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:10,230
I'm going to rest everything.

2136
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:17,090
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing!

2137
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:19,590
And if you stay up for me, head to bed!

2138
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:21,130
Cause you deserve it!

2139
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:23,050
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2140
01:57:23,570 --> 01:57:24,330
Bye guys!

2141
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:25,670
BYE!

2142
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:28,470
By the rest of the time you'll be playing rank!

2143
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:29,870
I'm not going to lie to you guys.

2144
01:57:31,450 --> 01:57:34,430
LAUGHS I'm going to try and get Top 500.

2145
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:35,910
Bye, everyone.

2146
01:57:36,230 --> 01:57:36,650
Bye!
