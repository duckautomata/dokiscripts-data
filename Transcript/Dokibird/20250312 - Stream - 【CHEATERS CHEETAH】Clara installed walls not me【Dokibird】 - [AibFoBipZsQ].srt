1
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,170
Hello, everybody!

2
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,770
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,310
By the way, guys, I was actually ready by the time the first intro part was playing.

4
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,950
But then I was like, no, make them wait.

5
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,250
I was like...

6
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,230
Do I start now after the first time is done?

7
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,490
Or do I just sit there and have two more minutes of me time?

8
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,770
I'm joking, I'm joking.

9
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,290
I love straight for you.

10
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,410
I was just like, no, let me make them wait two more minutes.

11
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,630
Legitimately, I was actually ready.

12
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:29,290
I just felt like, I was just like, you know what, today I feel, you know, today I feel a little quirky today.

13
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,130
I'm gonna make them wait.

14
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,710
Free lube, we take those.

15
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,490
But good morning, everybody.

16
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,990
Why am I saying good morning?

17
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,770
Well, I woke up at 4 p.m.

18
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,150
today.

19
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,750
Yes, my sleep schedule is a very fucked up right now.

20
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,150
Why is it fucked up?

21
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,750
Well, the first step is admitting that you have a problem.

22
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,610
And you sort of see where it's going towards to.

23
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,270
Um, so, I...

24
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,690
Not again!

25
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,230
Donkey, no!

26
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,890
You said you would...

27
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,310
Look, okay, I may or may not have relapsed last night.

28
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:26,190
And I may or may not have played 15 hours of Rivals last, last, last night.

29
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,170
And okay, look.

30
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,150
I have a perfect justification for this, guys.

31
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,210
Okay, so like, you know how...

32
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,850
Okay, so, I'm not in the lead of words anymore, of course, cause it's at like 400 points right now.

33
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,970
And, um...

34
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,630
And anyway...

35
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,490
I'm up two games by the way.

36
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,330
Alright, let me rip the band-aid off.

37
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:55,190
I am only up two games after the 15 hour session.

38
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,850
But, but it's not my fault.

39
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,970
It's not my fault.

40
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,810
So, I...

41
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,170
Okay, so like...

42
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,910
Okay, I'm just a little bit salty here.

43
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,070
But, basically, look.

44
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,210
There is justification...

45
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,810
Look, I'm not like making...

46
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,990
Look, it's not excuses.

47
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,210
There is justification.

48
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,050
I know I sound like an addict trying to find an excuse right now.

49
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,390
But like, this is an addict that has a good justification, guys.

50
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,450
I know it's like the 1%, 99% of addicts...

51
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,350
Usually, usually, it's sort of their fault.

52
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,010
But like, I swear to God, this is not my fault.

53
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,190
This time, I'm one of...

54
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,110
I am the 1% of the addicts.

55
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,470
Anyway...

56
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,690
So...

57
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,670
So...

58
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,310
I...

59
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,750
Okay, so like, you guys must be like, oh, Monday.

60
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,090
She's not streaming on Monday because, you know, she's resting.

61
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,910
And stuff like that.

62
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,610
No, because...

63
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,130
I actually arranged ahead of time...

64
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,250
Asking if I could get a...

65
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,050
If I could play with a 4-stack.

66
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,030
If I could play on a 4-stack.

67
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,230
For rivals.

68
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,730
So I can get it done.

69
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:09,830
Quote on quote.

70
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,470
Quick.

71
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,630
So I don't have to think about getting on the leaderboards later.

72
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,810
Because I want to be on the leaderboards for the Disguised Toast Tournament.

73
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,510
Because like, they put me in the pro slot.

74
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,650
So I was like, oh man.

75
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,970
I would like to...

76
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,510
I don't know.

77
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,710
I just felt like it's sort of like an ego thing.

78
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,590
Where I was like, well, since I'm on the pro slot.

79
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,750
I feel like I...

80
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,530
I feel like, you know.

81
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,970
I should like, look like I belong there.

82
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,290
Instead of like, being like, why the fuck is she there?

83
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,770
And then...

84
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,910
So like...

85
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,210
But then, look.

86
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,150
I asked every day.

87
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,610
If they were ready.

88
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,210
And if they have the time.

89
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,170
I made my schedule.

90
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,230
To like, for that specific...

91
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,270
I was like, okay.

92
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,530
Monday, right?

93
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,830
I won't stream on Monday.

94
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,630
So I can have the day to play rank.

95
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,150
So like, because they're like, Monday will be free.

96
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,510
And I was like, okay.

97
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,310
Monday, right?

98
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,970
And they're like, yeah, yeah.

99
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,350
Well...

100
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,430
Two of the three people.

101
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,030
On Monday.

102
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,750
Were like, sorry, we couldn't.

103
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,110
We can't make it.

104
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,210
And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

105
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,670
I was just like, are you...

106
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,510
I hate Mondays.

107
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,430
I...

108
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,070
I fucking hate Mondays.

109
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,730
Anyway.

110
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,130
Two of the three people.

111
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,910
Told me.

112
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,050
On Monday.

113
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,140
That they were not free.

114
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,570
And I was like, I...

115
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,390
I could...

116
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,050
I don't...

117
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,140
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

118
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,520
I could have been streaming on Monday.

119
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,640
So like...

120
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,690
So then like...

121
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,940
Unfortunately.

122
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,120
Or fortunately.

123
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,500
One person was free.

124
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,180
So we ended up duoing.

125
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,080
And then picking up random...

126
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,980
Not strangers.

127
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,960
But like random people.

128
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,920
I mean, they were sort of like strangers to me.

129
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,040
But like...

130
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,240
We're like, you're good.

131
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,180
And we just ended up like adopting players.

132
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
For four stacks.

133
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,580
But it didn't go so well.

134
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,740
It didn't...

135
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
It didn't...

136
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,620
It did not go so well.

137
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,400
So like...

138
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,820
After 15 hours.

139
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
I am up two games.

140
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,480
And I'm definitely not...

141
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,160
I mean, I'm like 60 points away from the leaderboard.

142
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,840
But...

143
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,660
You know.

144
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,900
I didn't min-max my stack.

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
I literally...

146
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,020
We got like...

147
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,520
Like...

148
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,140
At one point we bumped into like a really good Widowmaker.

149
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,980
I know.

150
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,780
It's like...

151
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,480
I was just like, fuck it.

152
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,940
They're known as like one of the best Widowmakers in NA.

153
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,620
But like...

154
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,520
Playing around a Widow is not like...

155
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,000
Very ideal.

156
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,260
For the team in general.

157
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,140
Because we have to make sure...

158
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,700
Everybody is willing to play around a Widowmaker.

159
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,400
But like...

160
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,900
Wow.

161
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,840
It's crazy.

162
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,660
Apparently random players want to play characters that they want to play.

163
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,960
Is that fucking insane?

164
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,260
That they all have their own fucking free will.

165
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,220
And...

166
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,820
Their own free will and minds.

167
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,820
To think about themselves.

168
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,840
Instead of like a collectivist.

169
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,240
Thinking about the fucking team.

170
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,420
But no!

171
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,320
We can't play around one single guy.

172
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,820
How did...

173
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,560
I can't believe people are so selfish.

174
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,660
I...

175
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,860
Sorry, Black Widow.

176
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,220
Sorry, I...

177
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,280
My brain is not doing so well.

178
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,260
I meant Black Widow.

179
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,020
I...

180
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,800
It's like...

181
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,460
Okay, it's not my fault.

182
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
Why the fuck are they both Widow?

183
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,960
Anyway, sorry.

184
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
I meant Black Widow.

185
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,880
We picked up one of the best Black Widows in NA.

186
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,240
And then like...

187
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,440
It's crazy.

188
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,280
Apparently people don't want to play around one person.

189
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,280
Is that insane to think about?

190
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,380
Like...

191
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,480
So...

192
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,300
And then...

193
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,420
So like...

194
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,480
And so...

195
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
Yeah, so I had that incident.

196
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,060
So, 15 hours of pure pain and grief.

197
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,680
And that is why I woke up at 4pm.

198
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,920
By the way, I'm a very petty person.

199
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,040
I straight up was like...

200
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,260
Was like...

201
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,300
Never again.

202
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,100
Like...

203
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,960
Cause like...

204
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,300
Okay.

205
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,180
I told them.

206
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,220
I told them, I was like...

207
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,140
That's not...

208
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,180
Like I was like...

209
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,640
Hey...

210
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,240
That is like...

211
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,820
Not...

212
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,160
Not okay.

213
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,680
Because like...

214
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,520
I literally freed up my entire day.

215
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,100
And made my entire schedule.

216
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,460
Just for that day.

217
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,860
Like I moved things around.

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,420
And I'm a very busy person.

219
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,040
What was the justification?

220
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,900
Well...

221
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,560
I won't say.

222
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,280
I won't say.

223
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,440
It's like...

224
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,520
It's not like...

225
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,060
It's not like...

226
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,940
Oh, someone died.

227
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,920
It was more so like...

228
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,400
What was like...

229
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,040
I'm EP.

230
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
And the other one was like...

231
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,320
I need to spend time with my girlfriend.

232
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,400
And I was like...

233
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,280
In my head, I was...

234
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,940
In my head, I was like...

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,460
You can see her everyday.

236
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,180
I was just like...

237
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,000
You can see her everyday.

238
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,260
I'm seeing you once yesterday.

239
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,500
I was like...

240
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,820
Rank over GF.

241
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,420
Too far got into...

242
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,800
Doki, you can't say...

243
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,780
Me or the girlfriend.

244
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,920
Choose.

245
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,440
You can sleep every...

246
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,580
Okay, look.

247
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,600
I'm joking.

248
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,180
I'm joking.

249
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
I'm joking, guys.

250
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,460
Look.

251
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,800
All I'm saying is...

252
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,180
Rank is life.

253
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,340
Yeah, you could see your girlfriend.

254
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,460
But wouldn't it be so cool to see me?

255
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,000
It would be so cool.

256
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,000
Anyway.

257
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,360
Anyway, so...

258
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,380
So, I was just like...

259
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,200
I was very petty.

260
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
Not petty, but also...

261
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,120
I don't like to be pushed over.

262
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,420
So, I was just straight up like...

263
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,900
Hey, that's not okay, guys.

264
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,640
My scheduling is very different.

265
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,740
I actually do have to plan.

266
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,520
Like I said, I plan my schedules...

267
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,160
A week in advance and everything.

268
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,360
So, obviously...

269
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,480
I set stuff up.

270
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,600
I move things around.

271
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,240
Because I was like...

272
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
Today is gonna be a rank day.

273
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,380
You know, like happily saying that.

274
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,800
And then, you know...

275
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,780
At the end, I was like...

276
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,400
Today was a rank day.

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,760
So...

278
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
So, I was like...

279
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,080
Yeah, I was just like...

280
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,980
Today was a rank day.

281
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,220
It could have been a happy rank day...

282
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,640
If I had my min-max stat.

283
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,720
It could have been.

284
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,640
That's the thing.

285
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,420
It could have been a happy rank day.

286
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,620
Instead, it was 15 hours of pure pain and grief.

287
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,660
So, yes.

288
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,380
That is why...

289
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,960
Long story short.

290
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,100
That was why I woke up at 4 PM today.

291
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,280
I actually had my meal.

292
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,520
My first meal of the day.

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,640
Still up 2, though.

294
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,610
Still up 2, though.

295
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,430
You know how late...

296
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,450
I played so late.

297
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,310
That my lobbies...

298
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,350
In NA, by the way.

299
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,330
I was in NA lobbies, by the way.

300
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,890
My queues...

301
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,970
I played so fucking late.

302
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,170
It was like the sun's out.

303
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,290
The people in my lobbies were Korean and Chinese people.

304
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,910
Korean and Chinese pro players in my lobby.

305
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,270
The person I was playing with, they were like...

306
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:15,730
Oh, yeah.

307
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:16,710
Oh, yeah.

308
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,570
Entire lobby.

309
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,470
Our team is all Korean players.

310
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,970
I was like, what?

311
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,030
People were actually comming in Korean.

312
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,310
I was like, oh my god.

313
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,110
I need help.

314
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,970
I was like...

315
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,630
I was just like...

316
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,190
Oh my god.

317
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,570
This is how down bad I am for ELO.

318
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,230
I am...

319
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,530
I've already like...

320
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,290
I'm in another country now.

321
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,390
I played for so long.

322
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,770
They literally transported me into a different country in NA.

323
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,130
I'm hungry.

324
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,630
I'm hungry for ELO.

325
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,110
Oh my god.

326
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,010
It was crazy.

327
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,430
I was not expecting it.

328
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,230
But I made a new Korean friend.

329
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,470
I made a new Korean friend.

330
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,970
His name is like FunFun.

331
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,370
He's in a team with Happy.

332
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,690
HappyHappy.

333
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,790
I don't like...

334
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,330
Is that crazy?

335
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,630
You might recognize them.

336
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,310
FunFun is part of a team with HappyHappy.

337
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,430
They're both part of one of the best Korean teams in Marvel Rivals.

338
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:29,990
I love their...

339
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,730
I know I love their name.

340
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,230
And I became friends...

341
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,250
Okay, here's a funny story about...

342
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,110
I know some of you guys are like, Stop talking about Rivals.

343
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,010
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,150
This is like...

345
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,510
Don't worry.

346
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,670
I have other stuff to talk about.

347
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,450
It's their joy.

348
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,830
I wish their entire team was just like...

349
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,330
FunFun.

350
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,050
HappyHappy.

351
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:48,730
JoyJoy.

352
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,490
SadSad.

353
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,370
Like if their team names...

354
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,770
If their entire player roster was just those types of names.

355
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,170
That would be so funny.

356
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,850
I think that would be honestly peak.

357
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,490
Anyway...

358
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,390
The thing is...

359
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,410
We kept bumping into FunFun in rank.

360
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,550
And then we lost our...

361
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,630
We lost our trio and four stack of people that we were picking up randomly.

362
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,810
So it was just Duos again.

363
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,410
And obviously, Duos is not that fun because...

364
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,810
It's so RNG.

365
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,170
And so...

366
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,490
And so...

367
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,530
We bumped into with FunFun and against FunFun.

368
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,110
But when we got into FunFun, he wasn't on streamer mode.

369
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,230
And apparently, he was on...

370
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,930
He had a phase where all he did was play The Thing.

371
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,310
And then so like...

372
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,210
Every time we had him on our team...

373
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,010
Someone on the enemy team was banning The Thing.

374
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,930
Because he was like playing with him and he's really good at it.

375
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:46,810
So like...

376
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,910
He kept being like...

377
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,610
Who is it?

378
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,510
Like in the chat.

379
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,690
In like...

380
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,710
In like broken English.

381
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,610
He was like...

382
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,850
Who did The Thing?

383
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,110
Who banned?

384
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,830
And then we were like...

385
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,570
Oh, FunFun.

386
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,050
Why aren't you in streamer mode?

387
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,890
And this happened for like two games straight.

388
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,430
We had him like three games straight.

389
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,330
Back to back to back.

390
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:08,670
And...

391
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,610
And then so like...

392
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,130
We were like...

393
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:12,670
FunFun.

394
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,510
And then FunFun was like...

395
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,670
Can I join you guys?

396
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,690
And then we were like...

397
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,670
Put on streamer mode.

398
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,190
And he's like...

399
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,130
No, me noob.

400
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,770
He was like...

401
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,730
No, me noob.

402
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,570
Me no play.

403
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,150
And I was just like...

404
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,890
I was like...

405
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,970
Put on streamer mode.

406
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,290
And you can join us.

407
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,290
And he was like...

408
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,630
No, me noob.

409
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,990
Me one carry.

410
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,450
And I was like...

411
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,930
I was like...

412
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,330
Bro.

413
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,970
And then like...

414
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,730
And then we got him on the enemy team.

415
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,370
And then I was like...

416
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,430
We banned The Thing.

417
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,200
Got him on the enemy team.

418
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,960
And I was like...

419
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,860
We banned The Thing.

420
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,160
And I was like...

421
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,400
And then I banned...

422
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
I banned The Thing.

423
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,640
And then he was like...

424
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,940
Who?

425
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,360
Who is it?

426
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,740
And then I was like...

427
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,180
FunFun.

428
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,400
Put on streamer mode.

429
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,200
And he was like...

430
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,540
No.

431
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,120
I

432
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,960
was like...

433
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,900
Okay, so...

434
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,080
Okay, I feel like everyone know.

435
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,840
It was like...

436
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,100
I was playing with...

437
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,700
I was playing with Gomez.

438
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,000
And then...

439
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,860
So like...

440
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,700
And then...

441
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,100
I was like...

442
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,200
And he was like...

443
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,960
Big mistake.

444
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,980
I have Gomez.

445
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,360
So...

446
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,020
So...

447
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,640
For those who don't know...

448
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,460
Super Gomez is part of Team Sentinels.

449
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,480
And he's like...

450
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,960
One of their...

451
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,640
He's their main...

452
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,880
He's their DPS player.

453
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,920
And then FunFun was like...

454
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,680
Big mistake.

455
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,920
Me have Gomez.

456
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,380
And then I was like...

457
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,540
No, you don't.

458
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:43,900
Like...

459
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,540
He's on my team.

460
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,760
And he's like...

461
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,860
No, you wrong.

462
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,160
And then...

463
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,400
Obviously...

464
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,060
Um...

465
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,640
He...

466
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,400
He...

467
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,060
He...

468
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,540
He...

469
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,640
He...

470
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,500
And then...

471
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,280
And then...

472
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,040
And then like...

473
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,740
He lost.

474
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,080
And he was like...

475
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,440
He was like...

476
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,960
Um...

477
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,660
And then...

478
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,160
I was like...

479
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,200
FunFun put on cheer voice like...

480
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,540
No.

481
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,400
And...

482
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,340
And then...

483
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,000
Honestly...

484
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,680
And then like...

485
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,640
The second time...

486
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,220
And then we got against him again.

487
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,580
I got...

488
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:23,940
And then...

489
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,800
I got against him...

490
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,340
Again.

491
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,820
And then...

492
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,080
I was like...

493
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,440
Bad thing.

494
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,960
I kept being like...

495
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,600
Bad thing.

496
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,440
Because I wanted to teach him a lesson.

497
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,360
I was like...

498
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,560
Just put on streamer mode FunFun.

499
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,660
Just like...

500
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,800
I have on streamer mode now.

501
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,340
Um...

502
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,800
And then...

503
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,720
I was like...

504
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,540
Put on streamer mode.

505
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,160
And then he was like...

506
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,460
Who?

507
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,660
Who is it?

508
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,440
And then I was like...

509
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,600
And then I just wrote...

510
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,940
And then he was like...

511
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,060
Who is it?

512
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,340
And then I was like...

513
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,020
Gomez.

514
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,980
And then he was like...

515
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,660
Oh, I see.

516
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,200
And then he...

517
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,240
And then FunFun...

518
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,320
Bad Starlord.

519
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,240
And I was like...

520
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,100
Oh, I see.

521
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,020
And then Starlord was bad.

522
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,980
Because like...

523
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,040
Gomez is a Starlord.

524
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,680
One trick.

525
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,680
And then Gomez was like...

526
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,540
What the fuck?

527
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,340
Like...

528
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:18,940
What the...

529
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,640
Why are you trying to...

530
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,380
Bad me?

531
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,140
Of course you...

532
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,260
Why did he trust you?

533
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:28,860
So...

534
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,180
Okay...

535
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,040
Um...

536
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,500
And...

537
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,260
So...

538
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,480
Um...

539
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,960
Um...

540
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,160
Um...

541
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,680
And then...

542
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,100
So...

543
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,560
So...

544
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,480
After that...

545
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,100
I was like...

546
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,620
I can't...

547
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,540
I can't keep playing against FunFun.

548
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,260
And...

549
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,440
Cause he's actually an incredibly...

550
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,700
Good tank.

551
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,840
And so like...

552
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,560
Cause he can play any tank and support.

553
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,940
So I was like...

554
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,700
I was like...

555
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,280
Oh, fuck.

556
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,680
We...

557
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,880
Just bring him in.

558
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,520
I was like...

559
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,140
At that point...

560
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,800
I was the only one target banning him.

561
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,540
Because...

562
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,140
We were playing so late...

563
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,420
That the people who recognized FunFun...

564
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,820
Weren't online anymore.

565
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,140
So I was like...

566
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,500
Okay...

567
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,320
Because they're not online...

568
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,680
I was...

569
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,540
I was literally the only one that was target banning him at that point.

570
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,980
So I was like...

571
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,540
Fuck it.

572
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,180
We...

573
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,060
We add...

574
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,300
We add him to the stack.

575
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,460
And then...

576
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,000
We add him to the stack.

577
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,200
And then he was like...

578
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,560
Hi.

579
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,860
He was like...

580
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,260
Hi.

581
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,520
Thank you for carrying.

582
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,120
And then...

583
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,760
He was just like...

584
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,920
He just came in.

585
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,440
I was like...

586
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
Thank you for carry.

587
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,620
And then...

588
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,640
He can't beat him.

589
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,240
He's so...

590
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,540
Everybody wins.

591
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,900
Everybody wins.

592
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,920
Oh, FunFun.

593
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,460
I love Korean players.

594
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,560
You're so fucking funny.

595
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,060
It reminds me of like...

596
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,080
The times I played a Korean players in...

597
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,260
In Overwatch.

598
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,140
Oh, and then...

599
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,920
It was so...

600
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,100
So...

601
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,460
Because...

602
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,060
His first game with us...

603
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,480
Nobody banned the thing.

604
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,800
But someone in our lobby...

605
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,040
DC...

606
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,120
And then FunFun was like...

607
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,760
Why me?

608
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,540
Chat is like...

609
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,240
No.

610
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,440
Why me?

611
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,260
And then...

612
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,980
We're like...

613
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,640
We're sorry.

614
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,520
FunFun.

615
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,180
But the thing was not banned.

616
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,140
And then we saw it not banned.

617
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,960
And FunFun was like...

618
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,660
Oh my...

619
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,020
It's like...

620
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,660
OMG.

621
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,820
Me...

622
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,060
I get to play.

623
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,200
And then...

624
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,940
In the moment he typed that...

625
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,160
Someone in our team...

626
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,420
DCed on character select.

627
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,420
Poor FunFun.

628
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,080
It was so close.

629
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,880
Poor guy.

630
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,180
Pain, pain and sad.

631
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:46,960
Sad.

632
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
The time...

633
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,420
Actually...

634
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,500
Unfortunate.

635
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,520
Bro, it was crazy.

636
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,020
I was like...

637
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,280
How is that possible?

638
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,000
Our first game as a stack.

639
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,500
And he gets to play the thing.

640
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,760
And then someone left.

641
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,740
Just someone had to leave on our team.

642
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,140
It was like insane.

643
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,900
Obviously, the match got cancelled too.

644
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,440
After...

645
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,960
Because like...

646
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,700
If you leave before the game starts...

647
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,980
Within a minute...

648
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,140
The match just gets cancelled.

649
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:16,720
And then...

650
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,940
That was insane that that happened.

651
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,660
Anyway, I need to get...

652
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,360
Tissues real quick.

653
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,020
I didn't realize.

654
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,640
I ran out of tissues.

655
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,380
Give me a sec.

656
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,580
I'm going to grab a new box.

657
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm doing my job.

658
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:39,890
Alright.

659
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,190
I'm back.

660
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,370
Sorry, it was like next to me.

661
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,350
Not next to me.

662
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,190
It was outside my door.

663
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,720
That was like...

664
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,920
My adventures.

665
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,900
In the actual...

666
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,240
Like...

667
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,280
At one point...

668
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,160
I played against...

669
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,100
The best team in China.

670
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,160
Like, they were four stacking.

671
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,140
And like...

672
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,040
They were four stacking on the enemy team.

673
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,540
I had to play against the best like...

674
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,460
Marble Rivals team in China.

675
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,300
And then after that...

676
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,840
We were like...

677
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,760
Take off West Coast.

678
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,180
Because they were obviously...

679
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,480
They were playing on West Coast server.

680
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,060
No, we did not fucking win.

681
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,340
With a bunch of random...

682
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,560
NA Crayon Eaters.

683
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,240
No, we...

684
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,860
At like...

685
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,720
Five in the...

686
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,940
Do you really think...

687
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,020
A bunch of random NA players...

688
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,220
At five in the morning...

689
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,640
Um...

690
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,020
At five in the fucking morning...

691
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,440
Um...

692
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,960
Be able to beat against a four stack...

693
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,880
Of the best...

694
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,940
China team...

695
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,160
Or Marble...

696
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,800
Yes.

697
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,500
Yes.

698
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,300
They could...

699
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,420
We were at five...

700
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,440
Guys, players you meet at five AM...

701
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,320
Are not...

702
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,220
Should not be real.

703
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,720
Like...

704
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,160
There is a reason why we're all playing...

705
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,580
At five in the morning, guys.

706
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,120
Like, we are at that point...

707
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,820
We are not real people at that point.

708
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,000
We are like...

709
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,980
The bottom of society...

710
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,640
At that time.

711
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,200
Those aren't people anymore.

712
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:10,940
Um...

713
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,100
But yes...

714
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,360
And then like...

715
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,880
Yeah, so like...

716
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,360
And then...

717
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,680
So we had to play against those people...

718
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,500
At five...

719
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,800
At five in the morning.

720
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,480
I was like...

721
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,180
Yeah, I'm...

722
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,760
I'm dodging...

723
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,660
The fucking rank one team in China.

724
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,420
Like...

725
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,540
Like, they absolutely destroyed us.

726
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,480
Like...

727
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,340
We are not...

728
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,500
People at five AM...

729
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,800
Are not coordinating them...

730
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,900
To even like...

731
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,500
Be a pro...

732
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,240
Like, to even think as a collective.

733
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,040
With...

734
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,180
And pass the first grade.

735
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,420
Like...

736
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,360
Like, they are way too good.

737
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,180
So we like...

738
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,260
Dodged them and stuff.

739
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,360
Um...

740
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,280
Anyway...

741
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,600
No...

742
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,860
Yeah, we had zero brain cells to share at that point.

743
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,520
What do you mean?

744
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
I'm saying like...

745
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,920
There was no way we could beat them.

746
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,100
They were so good!

747
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,080
They were so good!

748
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,260
And then like...

749
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,480
What's even funny...

750
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,560
Was that...

751
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,800
Right after...

752
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,300
Being...

753
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,520
Fucking absolutely demolished us...

754
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,640
They messaged...

755
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
Like, one of the members in that team...

756
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,420
Messaged Gomez...

757
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,120
And was like...

758
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,220
Can we scrim, you guys?

759
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,380
After...

760
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,160
They were like...

761
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,020
Can we like...

762
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,500
Arrange a scrim with your...

763
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,960
With Team Sentinels later?

764
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,420
I was just like...

765
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,260
Oh my god...

766
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,020
That's so fucking...

767
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,540
Get farmed!

768
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,100
Anyway...

769
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,340
Hey, can we scrim, you guys?

770
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,660
Later?

771
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,660
Love the title.

772
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,580
Nice reference.

773
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,980
Thank you, Frango...

774
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,160
For the Akasupa.

775
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,020
Thank you.

776
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,080
Thank you.

777
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,980
No, no...

778
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,820
It wasn't sent...

779
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,780
Not with the fucking...

780
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,060
5 AM...

781
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,520
More...

782
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,560
5 AM...

783
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,760
Crayon Eater Q.

784
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
No, I meant...

785
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,720
I meant the actual Team Sentinels.

786
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,780
I meant...

787
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,400
Anyway...

788
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
So yeah, that was like...

789
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,020
That was my 15 hour adventure...

790
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,440
Yesterday...

791
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,740
Night to morning.

792
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,040
I went to bed at like...

793
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,720
I think 8 in the morning.

794
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,600
I went to...

795
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,400
I went to bed at...

796
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,740
Okay, at one point...

797
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,840
We were encountering people who had no idea who Sentinels...

798
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,440
Like...

799
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,580
I...

800
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,560
Like, cause you know...

801
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,380
They're not real people at that point.

802
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,680
So we were running into people who like...

803
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,560
Don't know who like...

804
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,180
Gomez is.

805
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,740
Cause like...

806
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,780
The Sentinels are...

807
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,320
Is really well known...

808
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,800
In Marvel Rivals.

809
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,500
And they're like...

810
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,820
Currently the...

811
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,380
Rank 1 team...

812
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,000
At the moment.

813
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:47,820
Because of like...

814
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,620
Based off of like...

815
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,480
Winnings and stuff.

816
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
So we were...

817
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,580
So like...

818
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,900
We had one guy...

819
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,980
That was shouting slurs...

820
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,640
At...

821
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,780
Cause like...

822
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,620
We were asking him to swap off Hulk.

823
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,180
The Celestial 1 player.

824
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,280
We were like...

825
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,800
Could you swap off Hulk?

826
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,720
Because...

827
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,120
You know...

828
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,000
It's not working.

829
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,900
And obviously I wasn't saying that...

830
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,740
Because I'm a woman.

831
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,220
And I didn't want to get...

832
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,800
I was...

833
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,480
I'm afraid of saying...

834
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,380
Like...

835
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,500
I'm afraid to be confrontational...

836
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,560
In a rank lobby.

837
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,320
Especially...

838
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,300
During really late hours.

839
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,160
Because...

840
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,840
I...

841
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,160
Have no idea...

842
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,760
What people will say to me...

843
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,160
During those incredibly late hours.

844
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,640
Because at that point...

845
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,760
There's no rules...

846
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,400
At that point.

847
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,580
Like...

848
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,720
There's...

849
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,420
There's...

850
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,380
There's...

851
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,440
No more rules...

852
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,640
At that point.

853
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,600
So like...

854
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,120
I was like...

855
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,700
Hey can you...

856
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,160
Like...

857
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,820
So Gomez was like...

858
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,340
Hey can you swap off Hulk?

859
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,860
It's like...

860
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,500
Not working.

861
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,720
But he said it a little ruder.

862
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,580
And then...

863
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,360
And then the Hulk player...

864
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,320
Started like...

865
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,720
Saying slurs...

866
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,380
At him.

867
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,700
And then I straight up was like...

868
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,400
And saying like...

869
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,640
I'm carrying you.

870
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,420
Like...

871
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,980
You're so fucking bad.

872
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,480
And then...

873
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,160
Insert slurs randomly in that sentence.

874
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,940
And then I...

875
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,880
I straight up...

876
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,920
Talked in my mic.

877
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,460
And was like...

878
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,540
You don't know who Gomez is, do you?

879
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,100
Because he has like...

880
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,980
Hulk was like...

881
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,020
Celestial what?

882
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,560
And then the other team...

883
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,840
The other...

884
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,240
Someone in my team...

885
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,960
Was like...

886
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,920
You know this guy is sad, right?

887
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,700
And then...

888
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,030
And then...

889
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,590
And then the Hulk player was like...

890
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,390
Oh fuck...

891
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,430
Oh...

892
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,390
Um...

893
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,170
Um...

894
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,270
He was like...

895
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,030
And then the Hulk player was like...

896
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,790
Oh...

897
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,370
Oh...

898
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,030
Um...

899
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,310
Like he started like...

900
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,130
Fumbling...

901
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,530
He started fumbling...

902
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,050
And then...

903
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,670
And then I'm just like...

904
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,510
Okay...

905
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,370
Guy backed down so fast...

906
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,130
And then he started like...

907
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,610
Sucking up to Gomez...

908
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,290
And was like...

909
00:31:59,290 --> 00:31:59,890
Oh so like...

910
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,230
How much do you get paid?

911
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,210
Um...

912
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:02,950
And then like...

913
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,530
Oh man...

914
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,270
Like what's it like to be insensitive?

915
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,390
By the way...

916
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,830
He still didn't swap off Hulk...

917
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,370
By the way...

918
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,480
After the entire thing...

919
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,470
He still didn't...

920
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,570
Swap off Hulk...

921
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,910
We lost by the way...

922
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,530
We...

923
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,810
We lost by the way...

924
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,890
Even after he started sucking up...

925
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,170
Um...

926
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,290
Look at...

927
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,630
Yeah...

928
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,630
But at least he stopped saying slurs though...

929
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,950
Like...

930
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,650
You know...

931
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,910
You know like...

932
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,210
Baby steps guys...

933
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,810
He stopped slurring at us...

934
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,590
So at least that worked out...

935
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,070
Um...

936
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,370
No 100% I avoided him...

937
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,250
Um...

938
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:43,830
It's just...

939
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,270
You know...

940
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,230
One step at a...

941
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,790
I guess...

942
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,310
Yeah...

943
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,450
That's a plus...

944
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,970
Baby steps guys...

945
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,810
For...

946
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,510
Baby...

947
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,970
Baby steps...

948
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,210
Um...

949
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,190
Oh yeah...

950
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:54,730
So anyway...

951
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,130
That was my adventures in...

952
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,390
Marvel Rivals...

953
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:57,910
I'm sorry...

954
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,250
I talked about Rivals for 33 minutes...

955
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,890
But I was also stuck in...

956
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,250
Rivals Jail for 15 hours...

957
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,810
So you can tell why...

958
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,790
My mind...

959
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,310
Is like...

960
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,410
So fixated...

961
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,450
I was...

962
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,090
I was stuck there...

963
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,350
I got stuck there for a while...

964
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,510

965
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,350
Oh Jesus...

966
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:22,690
Anyway...

967
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,630
Other than that...

968
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:23,870
Alright...

969
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,930
Other life updates...

970
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,930
So let's give you a...

00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,630
I'll give you a dad story...

972
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,090
I'll give you a dad story...

973
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,350
Guys...

974
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,510
Um...

975
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,550
It's a really short one...

976
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,410
It's a really short one...

977
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,350
But basically...

978
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:36,530
Um...

979
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,150
So like...

980
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,650
You know how I always say like...

981
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,770
He loves women?

982
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,090
So like...

983
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:41,430
Today...

984
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,170
Like not today...

985
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,870
Sorry a couple of days ago...

986
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,270
Um...

987
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,630
You know...

988
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,890
I was taking him to...

989
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,510
Walkies!

990
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,230
Yes, Doki and Badoosh!

991
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:48,570
Woo!

992
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:49,350
Walkies!

993
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,630
I love walkies!

994
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:57,690
But it's late at night, as always, cause like, I do like, late night walks and like, afternoon walks for him.

995
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,310
And... when I went to the elevator, um...

996
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:07,650
(*coughs*) There was a bunch of guys that, you know, like, I don't know, early 20s.

997
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,690
I can't tell age anymore.

998
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,950
Um, but early 20s guys, just in the elevator.

999
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,130
And all the guys were like, Aw!

1000
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,970
Like, let's get, like, they wanted to like, interact with him.

1001
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:24,950
And then dad looked at them, and he was like, (*barking*) And then he was like, You're not a woman!

1002
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,510
Don't touch me!

1003
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,690
(*laughing*) He wouldn't even let them touch him!

1004
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,870
He was like, he was like, barking at him, he was like, Meh!

1005
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,860
(*laughing*) He like, looked at them, sniffed them, sniffed, like, Because they all put their hands out for them to, like, smell.

1006
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,640
And then he, like, sniffed the hand, and then he, instantly, the switch turned on, and he's like, Not woman.

1007
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,360
(*laughing*) He just, he just started barking at them.

1008
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,960
And then the thing is, I was like, I'm sorry, and he's like, it's okay.

1009
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,740
(*laughing*) And then, like, one of the guys is like, it's okay, it's because he's ugly.

1010
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,740
And then I was like, no, like, to his friend, it's because my friend's ugly, isn't it?

1011
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,740
And then I was just like, I'm like, I'm sorry.

1012
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:22,120
(*laughing*) And then, and then, like, and then I took him out of the elevator, and then this little fucker, Like, you know, I was like, come on, let's go, let's go.

1013
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:30,640
And then, like, I was walking to the lobby, like, walking to the lobby, to the door, And then, like, he looked back at them, and continued to bark at them.

1014
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,060
And was like, be gone, man!

1015
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,240
(*laughing*) He was like, nah, woman, be gone!

1016
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:44,980
Like, he looked at them, and was still barking at them, while I was taking us to the fucking door!

1017
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,560
(*laughing*) Keep walking!

1018
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,580
And he's like, nah, woman, leave!

1019
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,820
And then I was just like, please.

1020
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,020
And then, like, I went to the door, like, I was outside.

1021
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,380
And he was still looking at them!

1022
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,100
He kept, like, looking back as we walked, because he was just like, I can't believe they tried to touch me!

1023
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,760
(*laughing*) I was just like, Jesus fucking Christ!

1024
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,440
If it was women in the elevator, he would be all over them.

1025
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,240
He'd be like, ooh, touch me!

1026
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,300
Be happy!

1027
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,940
(*laughing*) He can be the only man in the area.

1028
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,620
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1029
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,280
I wonder if dad has ever met a man with long hair.

1030
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,520
It'd be really funny if that's the only way for him to interact with a man.

1031
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,680
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1032
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:50,340
Um, yeah, so, yeah, I don't know what, I don't know, I don't know how he became like that.

1033
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,760
Um, because, like, he loves, he loves my dad.

1034
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,140
So, like, I don't know why he hates men in general.

1035
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,940
So, I don't know how he just turned into that.

1036
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,220
(*laughing*) Also, like, okay, so, also a very quick thing.

1037
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,720
I was so sad because on Sunday, I had the cleaning ladies came in, and I was so happy.

1038
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,280
I was like, I'm gonna be productive today!

1039
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,800
And then, I'll talk about the cleaning, not situation, it was a great day.

1040
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,720
Um, and then I was like, on Sunday, I was like, yippee!

1041
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,020
I feel so productive!

1042
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:32,200
I'm gonna go outside and get, uh, dad's nails done.

1043
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,300
Because, like, um, because it was getting too long.

1044
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,920
And I'm gonna treat him to a nice day at the groomers for the drop-in service.

1045
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,480
And then, there's like two, and then I went to two different groomers.

1046
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,620
And they were like, and I walked there, by the way.

1047
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,980
I fucking walked there, that's a lot for me.

1048
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:57,720
(*laughing*) As someone that works at home, as their job, I walked to a place specifically for my dog.

1049
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,480
And then, I was like, and then they're like, sorry, the groomer is closed, like, it doesn't drop by on Sunday.

1050
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,940
And I was so fucking sad.

1051
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,480
I was like, I was like, going outside, never be productive again.

1052
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:20,810
I was just, in my head, I was like, being, being productive was a mistake.

1053
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:37,750
(*laughing*) I was like, can't believe that one day, I felt so good to go outside, and walked uphill to two different groomers.

1054
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:42,570
And I got told that I should come tomorrow, which was Monday.

1055
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:47,930
And I did go on Monday, because his nails was getting way too long, so I was just like...

1056
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,950
But on Monday, I didn't enjoy it.

1057
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:59,630
On Sunday, I was going to enjoy it, because I was like, yippee, I feel so good about myself.

1058
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,810
Let me go outside and get fresh air.

1059
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:06,930
And then, it like, justified my excuse to never go outside again.

1060
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,410
(*laughing*) I still go outside.

1061
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,410
No, I'm just joking, guys.

1062
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,170
I still go outside.

1063
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:17,330
But, there's more evidence, right now, to me, on why going outside is bad.

1064
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:20,510
Because nothing good ever happens when you go outside.

1065
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:23,980
(*laughing*)

1066
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,980
And I fucking hate Mondays, too.

1067
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,700
Uh, no name, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1068
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:39,960
Rookie mistake, she should have been playing Rivals, instead of being productive.

1069
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,200
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1070
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,280
Okay, now we actually play the game.

1071
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,000
Sorry, we had a 40 minute tangent here.

1072
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,840
Um, it was, a lot of stuff happened in the last two days, guys.

1073
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,320
(*laughing*) Anyway, we're playing Cheaters Cheetah.

1074
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,180
And I'm also giving away, oh my gosh, wait, I just stopped moving.

1075
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,240
What the fuck happened?

1076
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,520
(*laughing*) Wait, what the fuck happened?

1077
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,700
I just, I just stopped moving.

1078
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,300
I booted up my game, and then everything just stopped.

1079
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,460
Oh, oh no.

1080
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,020
Oh, where did my Steam go?

1081
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,120
Wait, did my Steam crash while I was trying to boot up this game?

1082
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,800
Oh, my Steam did crash.

1083
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,380
Wait, what the fuck?

1084
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,020
(*laughing*) What the fuck?

1085
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,700
Oh, wait, okay.

1086
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,320
Oh, wait, this didn't crash, that's weird.

1087
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,130
Okay, wait, give me a sec, let me...

1088
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,660
Well, this definitely crashed, so I gotta reboot that.

1089
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,100
Uh, whoa, what the fuck is going on?

1090
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,420
(*laughing*) Hi Doki, I'm glad that you're finally playing Counter-Strike 2.

1091
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,720
Here's 10 dollars to open a few crates and maybe get a super knife.

1092
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,660
Red, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1093
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:13,120
Alright, for those who don't know what Cheaters Cheetah is, it is, um, basically, uh, apparently, um, they worked with a cheating, cheat developer to make this game, which is really fucking crazy if you think about it.

1094
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,760
The fact that they worked with an actual, um...

1095
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,600
Wait, okay, let's see, connecting.

1096
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,720
Hello?

1097
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,940
Are you connecting?

1098
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,000
Oh, no, my... yeah, no, it's definitely, definitely crashed.

1099
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,320
Okay.

1100
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,920
(*laughing*) But it actually worked, yeah, they actually worked with a hack developer to make this.

1101
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,460
So it's basically a game where, like, everybody is cheating, and if you're not cheating, you get banned.

1102
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,280
(*laughing*) Like, what the fuck?

1103
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,500
That's such a crazy concept.

1104
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,160
And, like, and then, so, like, it's whoever cheats the fastest.

1105
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,020
So I feel like it's just gonna be, like, super fucking chaotic.

1106
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,280
Cause, like, if everybody's cheating, then who the fuck is winning?

1107
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,380
(*laughing*) We're finally gonna play the game, her PC.

1108
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,560
No, Lord Pancake, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1109
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,480
Yeah, my PC was like, yeah, no, we're not playing the game yet today.

1110
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,880
Alright, let's see, does it work now?

1111
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,980
Oh, yeah, there we go.

1112
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,500
Nice, okay, I'm okay now.

1113
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,820
Let me put, let me boot up Cheater's Cheetah again.

1114
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,880
Okay, now it works.

1115
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,720
What the fuck?

1116
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,120
That was so weird.

1117
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,060
It, like, actually, like, crashed for some fucking reason.

1118
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,600
Okay, Cheater's Cheetah.

1119
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,920
Whoa, I'm in.

1120
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:29,860
Instantly.

1121
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:31,820
Okay.

1122
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,880
Alright.

1123
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,920
I mean, that was fast, I did not expect- Alright, also, I'm giving away, like...

1124
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,900
Um, I believe I'm giving away...

1125
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,940
Two game codes.

1126
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,080
Also, let me know if they work, because the first code they gave me was already claimed.

1127
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:55,460
By the way, the developers of Cheater's Cheetah reached out to me when I first tweeted about the game, and they gave me free game codes.

1128
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,240
But, like, the first code was already claimed by somebody else, so I was like, that's okay.

1129
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,440
That's fucking weird.

1130
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,060
And so, like, but the second code worked.

1131
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,610
So I do have two more codes, but I don't know if they've already been claimed.

1132
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:21,660
Like, I don't know if they, like, accidentally, like, double-booked, like, codes or something to other people, and were like, oh, these codes are definitely not claimed.

1133
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,440
You should...

1134
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:34,480
So, like, so, like, whoever wins it, please tell me if it works or not, because I don't, I don't fucking know anymore.

1135
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,980
Alright, let's see.

1136
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,620
Press insert to open the cheat menu and turn on wallhacks.

1137
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,120
Oh, shit.

1138
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,920
Oh, that actually...

1139
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:47,540
Oh, rage.

1140
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,720
Rage.

1141
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,080
Okay, wallhack.

1142
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,660
Oh, my God, wait, can I like...

1143
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,920
Okay, I can't.

1144
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,160
Oh, shit, wait, I can.

1145
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,860
I can wallbang.

1146
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,960
Oh, my God, I'm playing CS right now.

1147
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,160
Wait, what is wallbangable?

1148
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,060
No, this isn't wallbangable.

1149
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Oh, my...

1150
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,080
Wait, is this what it's like?

1151
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,300
Oh, my God, is this what it's like?

1152
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,660
Now I know why people cheat.

1153
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,800
It's that easy?

1154
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,640
Oh, my God, it's just that easy.

1155
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,860
Who would've thought?

1156
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,940
Okay, let's put it on fullscreen, though.

1157
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,220
Excuse me, I'm playing a shooter.

1158
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,940
I want all the frames.

1159
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,000
Clara!

1160
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,500
Sorry, guys.

1161
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,420
Clara had control of my game a little bit.

1162
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,840
Guys, okay, bring down the master volume.

1163
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,780
Let me know if it's better.

1164
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,080
All right, you know...

1165
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,180
Why do I even give a crap about crosshair?

1166
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,940
Like, I'm cheating anyway.

1167
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,280
I'm like, wait a minute.

1168
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,640
I should not care about crosshairs if I'm already cheating.

1169
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,500
Is this wallbang?

1170
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:00,900
Yeah.

1171
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:01,580
Okay.

1172
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,000
Is this wallbangable?

1173
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,600
I don't know what is wallbangable.

1174
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,960
What is a...

1175
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,840
Is this a wallbang?

1176
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,140
Oh, shit.

1177
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:17,480
Oops.

1178
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,320
Is this a wallbang?

1179
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,060
What the fuck?

1180
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,020
How do I know?

1181
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,620
That's it.

1182
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,240
That's it.

1183
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,980
I'm angry.

1184
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,840
Wait, how do I get out of here?

1185
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,760
How do I get out?

1186
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,060
Get me out!

1187
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,240
I missed the instruction!

1188
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,220
Oh, there we go.

1189
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,580
That's it.

1190
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,420
I'm angry now.

1191
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,380
Wait, there's still one more.

1192
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,660
There we go.

1193
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:53,780
Nice.

1194
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,560
Well then, you check how well your weapon in the bottom right HUD.

1195
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,260
Now, head over and we'll explain...

1196
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,080
Wait, how do you check that?

1197
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,960
Okay, let's go over there.

1198
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,120
Oh, you have to aim at the glass.

1199
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,840
Okay, wait.

1200
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,440
Settings, audio.

1201
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,340
Let's bring down the sound effects to 0.85.

1202
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:15,900
Alright.

1203
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,700
Wait, is it?

1204
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,200
Yeah.

1205
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,440
Insert to open the cheat menu.

1206
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,660
Okay, turn on aimbot.

1207
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,460
See that little circle?

1208
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,360
The aimbot will automatically lock onto the area.

1209
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,200
There we go.

1210
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,320
Now, it'll lock into everything.

1211
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,100
Jesus Christ!

1212
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,480
Oh my God!

1213
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,860
Stop installing hacks on my screen!

1214
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,680
Whoa!

1215
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,840
Whoa!

1216
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,000
Oh, and the winner of the match gets the legendary banhammer.

1217
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,340
Why the fuck would you ever, like...

1218
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:01,860
Why the fuck would you ever, like, put Hokkaido Apex...

1219
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,360
Yay!

1220
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,180
God, you've gone too far.

1221
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,280
Is cheating really this fun?

1222
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,900
I might just hop onto it.

1223
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,660
Okay.

1224
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,560
Alright.

1225
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,700
Let's see here.

1226
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,780
Play tutorial, open cheat menu.

1227
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,320
Like, why the fuck would you ever turn this down?

1228
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,500
Like, you're just like, you know what?

1229
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,160
I wanna actually use...

1230
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,100
Who the fuck uses skill?

1231
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,940
Like, what the fuck?

1232
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,860
Like, why would you ever turn this lower?

1233
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,480
Like, to hide that you're cheating.

1234
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,480
Everyone's cheating!

1235
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:42,290
What do you mean...

1236
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,410
Everyone's cheating!

1237
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:44,350
Okay.

1238
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,310
Wait, can I actually do, like, multiplayer?

1239
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,070
Solo play.

1240
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,550
Wait, I can actually, like...

1241
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,150
Wait, semi-rage?

1242
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,730
Okay, let's do normal.

1243
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,130
I still wanna feel good about myself.

1244
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:58,070
Alright.

1245
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:02,850
Am I trying to play this game?

1246
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,290
That's what I'm saying!

1247
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,550
I was like, why would you ever play this game?

1248
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:07,190
One...

1249
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08,090
Bring it back.

1250
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,030
Oh no.

1251
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,150
Oh no.

1252
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,210
Oh...

1253
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,130
Oh no.

1254
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,110
Oh no.

1255
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:16,750
Oh no.

1256
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,090
Oh no.

1257
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:19,070
Oh no.

1258
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,450
Guys, I don't wanna spin no more.

1259
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,730
I'll just be here.

1260
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,370
I'll just be here, guys.

1261
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:30,870
Don't worry!

1262
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:32,850
What are they gonna do?

1263
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,450
Oh, kill me!

1264
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:34,910
Okay.

1265
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,130
Okay, they're just gonna kill me.

1266
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,330
Okay, that makes sense.

1267
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:38,610
Wait.

1268
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:39,370
Wait, okay.

1269
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,970
Open cheat menu.

1270
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:41,870
Oh shit.

1271
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,030
Oh shit.

1272
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:43,650
Okay, don't worry.

1273
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:44,410
I got it.

1274
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,230
Don't worry.

1275
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:46,690
I got it.

1276
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,790
I just have to reload.

1277
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,950
Oh my...

1278
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:50,310
No!

1279
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:52,450
Wait.

1280
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,070
I know what it is.

1281
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,890
There we go.

1282
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,710
Guys, it's cause I...

1283
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:07,690
My biggest issue was that I had to reload, guys.

1284
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,570
That was the...

1285
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,250
That was my biggest problem.

1286
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:18,770
I have superior firepower now.

1287
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,170
Look at that.

1288
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:21,550
Easy.

1289
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,450
Where's the cheat for infinite?

1290
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,110
There we go.

1291
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:28,730
Oh my god.

1292
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,450
This is so easy.

1293
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,390
Look.

1294
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,850
Oh man.

1295
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,330
Imagine having fucking...

1296
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:41,050
Imagine having to reload, guys.

1297
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:43,310
Imagine that.

1298
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:46,230
This is real firepower.

1299
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,130
Hey.

1300
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,550
You know what?

1301
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,410
I think I can fight real hackers now.

1302
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,250
After that.

1303
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,090
I'm pretty sure I'm...

1304
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,290
Guys, I think I'm good enough to fight real hackers.

1305
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,770
100% accuracy.

1306
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:01,930
Yeah!

1307
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,650
She's so good.

1308
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,050
Wait, this is just normal CS.

1309
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,670
Let's go.

1310
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,070
A 75 kills streak.

1311
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,390
Get out of here.

1312
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,470
Get out of here.

1313
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,030
That's fucking right.

1314
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:17,810
Leave.

1315
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:19,250
Leave.

1316
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:21,530
That's right.

1317
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,670
I'm the biggest cheater around.

1318
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,830
The cheetah cheetah.

1319
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:27,910
Yeah.

1320
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,110
I will be like her when I grow...

1321
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:35,350
What the fuck?

1322
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:35,930
Okay, wait.

1323
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:36,950
Let me look at my...

1324
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,090
Let me open my cheat menu.

1325
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,890
Advanced...

1326
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,050
What the fuck?

1327
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:43,790
Okay.

1328
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:45,070
Alright.

1329
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,730
What the fuck?

1330
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:53,070
What am I gonna do with all of this grenade prediction?

1331
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:54,970
Show bounce.

1332
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,430
Wait, I can predict grenades?

1333
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:00,790
What?

1334
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,790
Wait, what?

1335
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:08,910
Head, body, enable hitbox, enable multipoint.

1336
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,870
Oh my god.

1337
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:14,130
Is this what it's like to have silent aim?

1338
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,810
Oh my god.

1339
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,670
You won't be able to hear the power.

1340
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:22,070
Oh, that's like when you don't hear like the aimbot.

1341
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,350
Oh, I can't do enable.

1342
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:23,970
Oh, I can.

1343
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,290
So, like, you see where I'm hitting.

1344
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,390
But, like, why would you ever hit anything but the...

1345
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,650
Okay, so if you're, like, trying to pretend you're not a hacker, you turn on body.

1346
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,030
So, like, you turn on body and then multipoint.

1347
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,770
So, like, you can try to aim for the head.

1348
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,710
Or you do, like, center mass.

1349
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:43,770
Or, like, this is actually with, like, um...

1350
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,570
It makes it so that you can fake it type deal.

1351
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,350
You're fake aimbotting if you're...

1352
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:50,510
Welcome back.

1353
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:51,070
Close enough.

1354
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,810
Welcome back, ToteKing.

1355
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1356
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,010
Thank you, thank you.

1357
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:59,030
So, like, the thing is, a lot of people do this in Apex.

1358
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,170
How do you know this?

1359
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:07,490
Because I found out one of my acquaintances, like a mutual friend, like a friend of a friend that I played with.

1360
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,430
Was actually an aimbotter.

1361
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,010
But I never played rank with him.

1362
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:11,650
I've only...

1363
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,930
Like, it was when I already got...

1364
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,810
Um, when I was, like, just in my phase.

1365
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:19,570
Um, where I was just, like, playing quick play and stuff like that.

1366
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,550
So, like, a friend of my friend...

1367
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:26,390
Um, my friend told me, it's like, do you remember this guy that you played with?

1368
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,370
And, like, um, that, like, that you played with in quick play?

1369
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,130
And I was like, yeah.

1370
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,490
And he's like, oh, yeah.

1371
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,770
So, I played with him in rank.

1372
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:37,350
And then, like, I found out that he was actually a hacker, like an aimbotter.

1373
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,510
And then, but, like, they, like, fake it.

1374
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,250
Like, they try to pretend that it's natural aim and everything.

1375
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,270
And then they, like, showed, like, like the...

1376
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,890
Like, they showed him the aimbot, like, cheat and stuff.

1377
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,830
And I was like, what the fuck?

1378
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:51,470
Wait, that guy?

1379
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,270
And he's like, oh, yeah.

1380
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,830
And then, like, he was, like, naming...

1381
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:57,210
And he, like, that guy, the mutual friend of a friend...

1382
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:04,510
Exposed to him all the people that he knew and played with that were actually secretly hacking.

1383
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,550
And it was...

1384
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,190
And they used to be legit, too.

1385
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,110
They used to be, like, Pred players.

1386
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:10,430
I mean, they aren't Pred players.

1387
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:11,830
But then they're, like...

1388
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:12,550
But then, like...

1389
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:15,370
Obviously, like, people got better.

1390
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,110
And, like, other people started hacking.

1391
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:22,630
So then these Pred players were like, well, if everybody else is hacking, I might as well start hacking, too.

1392
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,050
So, like, this is an apex.

1393
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,410
And then I was like, wait, like, these...

1394
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,750
And then he started naming names.

1395
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,530
And so I was like, oh, yeah, this guy, this guy, this guy.

1396
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,230
They're all, like, actually walling and stuff.

1397
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,570
They're all, like, walling.

1398
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,230
Or, like, using, like, um...

1399
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:38,690
Um, really...

1400
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,850
Like, aimbot where it was, like, very subtle.

1401
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,970
But you can still get away with it if you have, like, an...

1402
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,950
If you actually have good aim with aimbot, it's so fucking hard to, like, catch them.

1403
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:51,670
So, like, there's, like, a bunch of, like, players.

1404
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,310
I don't know.

1405
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:53,130
They're not...

1406
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,310
They might not even be playing anymore.

1407
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:59,590
But there used to be, like, a bunch of, like, Pred players in the leaderboards that were just secretly hacking.

1408
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:01,270
And, like, um...

1409
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:02,090
Or, like, walling.

1410
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:04,550
Because, like, you can't get caught when walling.

1411
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,230
Um, it's very hard to get caught if you're using wallhacks.

1412
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:13,050
Because the only way to get caught using wallhacks is if someone racks you out.

1413
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:15,390
Or, like, if you're being really fucking stupid with it.

1414
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:16,210
So...

1415
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:23,170
So, like, there's a lot of players out there that are actually secretly wallers.

1416
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:24,930
Or, like, with, like, really...

1417
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,570
Or have, like, really good aimbot.

1418
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:30,050
Because if you're really already a really good player...

1419
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:31,110
Um...

1420
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,050
It's, um, so hard to get caught.

1421
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:34,310
Um...

1422
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,630
Are you aimbotting?

1423
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,250
Bro, I play Luna Snow!

1424
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,970
If I was already...

1425
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:42,270
If I was secretly hacking, I'd be playing Adam Warlock.

1426
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,190
I would not be fucking playing Luna Snow.

1427
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,010
The lowest DPS for a healer in the game.

1428
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:47,950
Well, that's not true.

1429
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:48,970
There's still, like, two.

1430
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:50,410
But you get what I mean.

1431
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,310
Why the fuck would I aimbot on Luna Snow?

1432
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,190
Her DPS is so fucking shit.

1433
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:59,890
I would be DPSing as either Mantis or Adam if I was secretly hacking, guys.

1434
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,630
Uh...

1435
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,350
Oh, yeah.

1436
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:03,050
There's Raccoon.

1437
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,990
But I'd rather chop off my fucking hands and play Raccoon.

1438
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:06,930
Alright.

1439
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,290
What the fuck is this?

1440
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,670
Show behind walls?

1441
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,610
Model?

1442
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,050
The fuck is that?

1443
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:12,510
Cham?

1444
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:17,470
I am not a hacker to realize what the fuck any of these things mean.

1445
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:20,310
What the fuck do any of these things mean?

1446
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:21,750
What?

1447
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:22,930
What now?

1448
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,910
You gotta calm down.

1449
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,930
Bro, it's just a game.

1450
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,630
It's not just a game.

1451
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,430
It's life.

1452
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,330
Alright.

1453
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,330
Pick and raid.

1454
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:34,630
Alright.

1455
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,170
Do we have anybody here that has cheetahs?

1456
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:37,530
Cheetah?

1457
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,190
Alright, I'm gonna host a game.

1458
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:42,930
Um...

1459
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,750
Turn off your cheats.

1460
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,210
We fight like men.

1461
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,670
We are not playing VC.

1462
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:58,830
Alright.

1463
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:02,430
Let's see.

1464
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,190
I'm in the dookie.

1465
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,430
Guys, I swear to God.

1466
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:08,030
I'm...

1467
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,270
Oh my God, is that what it looks like?

1468
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:13,370
Wait.

1469
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:14,190
That's what...

1470
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,730
Oh, that's like the grenade projector.

1471
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:18,370
That's right.

1472
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,010
Turn off your cheats, bitch.

1473
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:21,850
Oh, okay.

1474
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:23,830
Nice fight.

1475
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:25,010
That's fucking right.

1476
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:26,370
Oh, wait.

1477
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:27,210
Nothing works.

1478
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:27,570
Okay.

1479
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,350
That's fucking right.

1480
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:30,530
We fucking...

1481
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,150
Turn off your cheats, guys.

1482
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:39,570
No cheats allowed except for...

1483
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,490
You know that?

1484
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,350
That's...

1485
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,190
That's...

1486
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,310
That's the...

1487
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,610
Yeah, that's like the predicted...

1488
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:45,710
Guys, I'm sorry.

1489
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,630
Guys, guys, no cheats allowed, guys.

1490
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,450
This is a real game now.

1491
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,730
We're gonna play...

1492
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:51,390
Oh my God, wait.

1493
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,330
Do I have like...

1494
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,170
Okay, let's see.

1495
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:55,830
Enable hitbox.

1496
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:58,870
Okay, let's do the baby mode because I can't...

1497
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:59,990
I cannot deal...

1498
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,190
Wait.

1499
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,850
We're CSing now.

1500
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,670
We're CSing free.

1501
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,050
We're gonna...

1502
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,690
No cheats all night.

1503
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,010
Alright, first round is knife round, guys.

1504
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:15,690
First round is always knife round.

1505
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:16,830
This is knife round chat.

1506
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:18,810
Don't worry.

1507
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,410
They don't know I have third-person mode on.

1508
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:23,090
They won't know.

1509
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,150
I'm the CS crowd.

1510
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,330
I was like, you're right.

1511
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:31,990
I could give up...

1512
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,350
You know what?

1513
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,530
I'll give up two codes right now since we're here.

1514
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:35,550
Alright, guys.

1515
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,870
I'm just gonna post it in chat.

1516
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:37,390
Get ready.

1517
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,590
Let me know if these codes work because I don't know.

1518
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:41,150
Alright, guys.

1519
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:41,510
Ready?

1520
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:42,870
Since we're playing together.

1521
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:43,910
Alright.

1522
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,090
Here's the first code.

1523
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,670
Just out of nowhere.

1524
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:49,450
Just...

1525
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:50,770
Anyway.

1526
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,790
Huge shoutout to Cheaters Cheetah for giving me codes.

1527
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,230
Just like that.

1528
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:58,370
Yeah.

1529
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,390
Just like that.

1530
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:00,470
There you go.

1531
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:01,390
Here's the code.

1532
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,570
And then here's another code too.

1533
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:04,350
Oh, it worked.

1534
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:04,730
Nice.

1535
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:05,190
Alright.

1536
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,710
Now people can join in.

1537
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:08,990
Do we have...

1538
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:09,890
Do we have ten yet?

1539
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,430
Guys, where's my...

1540
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:13,610
Where's my cheaters?

1541
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,170
No cheats, by the way, guys.

1542
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:15,670
No cheats.

1543
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:15,850
No cheats.

1544
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:16,150
Oh, wait.

1545
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,330

00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:19,810

1547
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:19,950
Wait.

1548
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,270
Sniper only?

1549
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:22,690
Oh, shit.

1550
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,030
Wait.

1551
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:23,550
Wait.

1552
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,090
I mean, everyone...

1553
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,350
Does it really matter if it's one shot?

1554
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,750
Let's do team deathmatch.

1555
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,570
Do we do team deathmatch or what's rage?

1556
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,350
One cheater on rage.

1557
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:39,290
Oh, wait.

1558
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,470

1559
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:44,670

00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:45,190
That's me.

1561
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,050
That...

1562
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:54,650
One person and it's gonna be me.

1563
00:58:58,690 --> 00:58:59,570
That's right.

1564
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:01,410
No cheats allowed.

1565
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:08,650
We need three more.

1566
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:09,630
We need three.

1567
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,110
Don't cheat, please.

1568
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:14,550
I hold all the power now.

1569
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,930
It's only fair, guys.

1570
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:18,730
It's...

1571
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:18,850
Wait.

1572
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,750

1573
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:22,630
Alright.

1574
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,430
Raid bot.

1575
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,670
One versus...

1576
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:28,510
What the fuck?

1577
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,310
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1578
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,120
Whoa.

1579
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,640
I thought turn up VC.

1580
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,740
Wait a minute.

1581
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,200
Voice chat off.

1582
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:43,820
Okay.

1583
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,820
One versus...

1584
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,700
Oh, my God.

1585
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,500
They're throwing grenades.

1586
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,500
That's cheating.

1587
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,980
I think he was saying dick.

1588
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:57,940
I'm pretty sure.

1589
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:58,800
Oh, shit.

1590
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,090
Okay.

1591
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:04,650
What?

1592
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,650
How are they getting me?

1593
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,250
That's insane.

1594
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,070
Oh, no.

1595
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:12,770
Oh, no.

1596
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,150
They're just throwing grenades.

1597
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,870
No.

1598
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,450
They're just throwing grenades.

1599
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:18,910
That's not fair.

1600
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,570
They have to be cheating, too.

1601
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:26,670
How are they doing this?

1602
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:29,830
How are they doing this?

1603
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,650
What?

1604
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:34,870
Oh,

1605
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:40,980
my God.

1606
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,740
What the fuck?

1607
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,650
I'm trying my best.

1608
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,090
Where's my mini gun?

1609
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:49,910
Okay.

1610
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,170
That's...

1611
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:52,490
That's enough.

1612
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:53,550
I'm mad.

1613
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,210
I'm mad now.

1614
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,170
I'm mad.

1615
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:00,910
Oh, shit.

1616
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:01,690
He knows I'm reloading.

1617
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,790
I'm mad now.

1618
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,650
Get over here.

1619
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,310
I'm so mad.

1620
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:10,670
No.

1621
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:12,110
No.

1622
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,010
That's it.

1623
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,850
This is not fair.

1624
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,050
This is not fair.

1625
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:23,290
They're using utilities like actual players against actors.

1626
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,970
They're using utilities.

1627
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,690
That's not fair.

1628
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:31,590
Oh, no.

1629
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:32,590
Oh, no.

1630
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:33,890
Oh, no.

1631
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:35,790
They're using you, too.

1632
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:39,170
I can't believe it.

1633
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:42,570
Oh, my God.

1634
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,350
Not you, too.

1635
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:48,870
No, I got it.

1636
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,170
Oh, my God.

1637
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:57,410
Oh, my God.

1638
01:01:58,570 --> 01:01:59,570
Get out.

1639
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:00,750
Get out.

1640
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,010
Oh, shit.

1641
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:05,030
I can't believe it.

1642
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:06,270
That's it.

1643
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:09,090
I'm actually angry now.

1644
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,410
Oh, my God.

1645
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:11,830
Wait, no.

1646
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:12,850
That's way too angry.

1647
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:14,530
Oh, my God.

1648
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:15,550
That's fucking right.

1649
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:17,790
That's right.

1650
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,250
There's too many.

1651
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:20,950
There's too many.

1652
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:25,030
Oh, my God.

1653
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:26,430
Oh, my God.

1654
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,270
There's too many of you.

1655
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,530
I thought there were ten.

1656
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,070
There's not ten people.

1657
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,310
There's no way to send.

1658
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:33,350
There's no...

1659
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:35,290
Utilities.

1660
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:36,570
No.

1661
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:38,950
Not the you, too.

1662
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,470
Oh, my God.

1663
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,410
Not the you, too.

1664
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:48,150
Here.

1665
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:49,970
What?

1666
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,930
No, get me out.

1667
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:54,550
No.

1668
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:01,430
Oh, my God.

1669
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:03,370
That's not fair.

1670
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:04,530
What?

1671
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,870
I thought you guys...

1672
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:09,230
What?

1673
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:11,390
I don't understand.

1674
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,090
I had aim.

1675
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:16,890
How did I lose?

1676
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:23,530
Cheaters never win, doggy.

1677
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:24,770
How did I...

1678
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,190
How did I lose?

1679
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:27,790
Okay, wait.

1680
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:30,950
I'm the one rage cheater.

1681
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:33,230
It's not fair.

1682
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:35,730
It's not fair.

1683
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,070
This is actually not fair.

1684
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,070
Also, what the fuck was that guy saying?

1685
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:47,850
Was he saying dick?

1686
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,910
Was he just being like dick, dick, dick, dick?

1687
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:52,230
All I heard was dick.

1688
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,570
I hope he wasn't slurring.

1689
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,050
I hope he...

1690
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:55,750
Okay.

1691
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,810
Okay, I was like...

1692
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,550
I was like...

1693
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,370
I hope he was not slurring.

1694
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:05,950
I thought he was saying dick.

1695
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:09,370
It was joking.

1696
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:10,010
Thank God.

1697
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,370
I was like, I hope guys...

1698
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:12,450
I was like...

1699
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:12,830
Okay.

1700
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:13,890
Alright.

1701
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:14,950
So, like...

1702
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:16,470
That didn't work, guys.

1703
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:17,770
That...

1704
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:19,350
That...

1705
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:19,830
That...

1706
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,870
Guys, that...

1707
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:23,810
That didn't work.

1708
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:24,850
So, let me just...

1709
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:25,530
You know what?

1710
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,650
Let's just make it...

1711
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,790
We all start cheating, guys.

1712
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:29,390
Yeah.

1713
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:36,470
Let's just all start cheating, everybody.

1714
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:39,210
Let's all just...

1715
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,290
Guys, guys.

1716
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,970
Let's just all start cheating.

1717
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:45,830
Yeah.

1718
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,510
I can't believe it.

1719
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:58,430
I can't believe they use u-tilt like a fucking nerd.

1720
01:04:58,990 --> 01:04:59,790
Fucking try...

1721
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:00,650
Oh my God.

1722
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,890
I knew you guys are CS players.

1723
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,900
Goddamn CS players in my lobbies.

1724
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,380
Using fucking u-tilt.

1725
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,360
Nerds.

1726
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:14,960
All of you.

1727
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,120
Fucking nerds.

1728
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,280
Oh my God.

1729
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,580
You cheated not only the game, but yourself.

1730
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:25,480
You didn't grow.

1731
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,320
You didn't improve.

1732
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,540
You took a shortcut and gained nothing.

1733
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,940
You experienced a hollow victory.

1734
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,520
No, not even a victory.

1735
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:33,620
A hollow...

1736
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:33,900
No!

1737
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:34,720
Dad!

1738
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:35,580
Stop!

1739
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,220
Stop shaming me!

1740
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,120
Stop shaming me!

1741
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,900
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

1742
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:44,700
Thank you.

1743
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,420
Thank you.

1744
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,480
Please!

1745
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,500
Stop shaming me!

1746
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:50,440
Stop!

1747
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:54,980
No!

1748
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:56,760
No!

1749
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,560
Don't shame me!

1750
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,860
Alright, we need one more person.

1751
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:03,820
Oh, fuck it.

1752
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,260
Let's just...

1753
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,700
One team just isn't gonna have...

1754
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,560
One team just isn't gonna have ten players.

1755
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,100
Or five players.

1756
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,180
Stop!

1757
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,220
Stop!

1758
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,110
Alright.

1759
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:23,670
Oh my God.

1760
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:27,730
Alright, we need a third person.

1761
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,670
Oh my God.

1762
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:30,470
The spin.

1763
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:32,270
Okay.

1764
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:36,790
Nice!

1765
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:37,910
Wait, that's my teammate.

1766
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:42,990
That's right.

1767
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:44,830
This is how you make your aimbot natural.

1768
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:45,790
Oh my God.

1769
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:46,790
Not the u-tail!

1770
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,130
Not the u-tail!

1771
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:54,190
Oh my God.

1772
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,210
This guy is going fucking crazy.

1773
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:57,490
This guy.

1774
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:57,910
Woah.

1775
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:58,610
That's right.

1776
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,810
I'm gonna...

1777
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,050
That's actually right.

1778
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:04,910
I know how to fucking fight a...

1779
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:05,270
Oh!

1780
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:07,710
Bitch.

1781
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:12,210
The pink tip.

1782
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:13,710
Lies.

1783
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:15,090
I'm just that good.

1784
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:15,570
You know what?

1785
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:17,910
Fuck you guys and your stupid u-tail.

1786
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,510
Fuck you guys.

1787
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:20,930
Fuck you guys.

1788
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:21,630
Oh shit.

1789
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,130
Okay, nice.

1790
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:26,310
Just start jiggle peeking.

1791
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:28,830
Just start jiggle...

1792
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:29,590
Oh my God.

1793
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,150
Oh my God.

1794
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:30,790
There you go.

1795
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,330
That's a good aim.

1796
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:37,770
Oh my God.

1797
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:37,910
Look.

1798
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:38,290
Oh.

1799
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:39,010
Woah.

1800
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,310
Woah.

1801
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:45,430
Oh shit.

1802
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:47,030
I'm insane.

1803
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:49,190
Oh no!

1804
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:50,370
God.

1805
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,470
The jiggle.

1806
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:52,490
Oh shit.

1807
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:53,770
He's sitting so fast.

1808
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,210
Holy fuck.

1809
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:56,610
The jiggle peeking.

1810
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,270
That's right.

1811
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:01,110
This is how you actually aimbot, guys.

1812
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,550
For real.

1813
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:03,210
Oh wait.

1814
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:03,890
That's my teammate.

1815
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:06,310
I was like, why am I aimbot not working?

1816
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:07,730
Oh my God.

1817
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:08,690
Oh my God.

1818
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:09,410
Look at him go.

1819
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:10,990
Oh no!

1820
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:12,270
God.

1821
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:13,550
Spin.

1822
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:15,950
Oh my God.

1823
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,410
Okay, guys.

1824
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:17,230
I gotta...

1825
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:17,550
Wait.

1826
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:18,490
What am I using?

1827
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:20,070
Oh my God.

1828
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:21,290
The AWP.

1829
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,130
Oh my God.

1830
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:24,890
Come on.

1831
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,030
Peek me.

1832
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,880
Oh my God.

1833
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,460
Wait.

1834
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,240
Come on.

1835
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,600
Holy shit.

1836
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:45,800
Oh my God.

1837
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:46,540
Are you okay?

1838
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:48,880
Oh no.

1839
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,640
Oh my God.

1840
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,040
Oh my God.

1841
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,020
He finally left.

1842
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:56,760
Okay.

1843
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:57,880
Okay.

1844
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:58,240
Wait.

1845
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,060
What's the SM?

1846
01:08:59,300 --> 01:08:59,580
Okay.

1847
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,520
No more AWPing.

1848
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,260
He saw an opportunity.

1849
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,580
Oh, it'll be so fun with walls with an AWP.

1850
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,020
Spun too much.

1851
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,440
You spun too much.

1852
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,880
That's right.

1853
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,140
This is how you actually start hacking.

1854
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,720
Use the walls to your advantage.

1855
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,240
Oh, you're right.

1856
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,780
The sniper mode will go so fucking hard.

1857
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,660
You're so right.

1858
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,000
Come on.

1859
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:28,780
Oh.

1860
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:30,160
That's right.

1861
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,920
Tack this, bitch.

1862
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,780
No, shit.

1863
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,380
Not the nades.

1864
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:36,560
Oh, fuck.

1865
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,560
Oh, fuck.

1866
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:37,900
God.

1867
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:38,560
There's everywhere.

1868
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,740
That's fucked up.

1869
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,080
Professional cheater.

1870
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,420
That's right.

1871
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,120
I played with enough hackers to know how to hack a hacker.

1872
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:51,860
What's happening?

1873
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,700
Guys, if I go to spin mode, you guys are going to get fucking most...

1874
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,140
Wait, actually...

1875
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,100
Wait, if I do third person spin mode, maybe?

1876
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,800
Third person.

1877
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:05,800
Wait.

1878
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:06,880
Oh, shit.

1879
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,440
Wait, what the fuck?

1880
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,720
I'll make it go faster.

1881
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,540
I will make my spin go faster.

1882
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,320
Wait, how did it go so fast?

1883
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,760
That's fucking...

1884
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,480
I'm ready.

1885
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,640
I'm fucking spin.

1886
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,340
How does he go so fast?

1887
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,760
How does he go so fast?

1888
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:34,660
I don't understand.

1889
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:36,440
Wait, okay.

1890
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:36,880
Miss.

1891
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,080
Bounce.

1892
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:38,600
Show.

1893
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,220
Guys, I want to spin just as fast.

1894
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,480
Spin to win.

1895
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:44,580
He's just better.

1896
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:45,400
Wait.

1897
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,260
Rage tab?

1898
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,260
No, it just says spin.

1899
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,880
I can't spin any faster.

1900
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,820
Wait, there's rage advance?

1901
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,920
Where's the rage advance?

1902
01:10:59,140 --> 01:10:59,800
Teammate.

1903
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,920
Oh, there it is.

1904
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,280
Okay.

1905
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,700
What is pitch?

1906
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,960
I'm ready.

1907
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,380
That's right.

1908
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,420
That's a god fucking rage.

1909
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,180
No!

1910
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,420
How was he off it?

1911
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,600
Bro!

1912
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,580
How the fuck are you off it?

1913
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:29,440
Oh, no.

1914
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,240
Oh, no.

1915
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,920
Oh, we win!

1916
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:33,580
Let's go!

1917
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,400
Where is your god now?

1918
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,640
Where is he now?

1919
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:41,900
No!

1920
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,880
I wanted to be better.

1921
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,660
When you're out of adderall.

1922
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,900
There we go.

1923
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:54,760
We did it, guys.

1924
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,220
I did it, guys.

1925
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,060
I won.

1926
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,200
On me.

1927
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,000
Rotation.

1928
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,700
I was throwing Fortnite.

1929
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:07,580
Rotation.

1930
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,480
Okay, so thank you for the super chat.

1931
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:10,920
Thank you.

1932
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,080
Thank you.

1933
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,760
Okay, guys.

1934
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:16,440
Okay.

1935
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,800
So, let's do...

1936
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,140
Oh, okay.

1937
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:18,780
Let's actually...

1938
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,260
Let's do like...

1939
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,580
Oh, let's do legit sniper only.

1940
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,760
I wanna see how you guys do that.

1941
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,860
Let's do legit sniper only, guys.

1942
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,440
We're playing real now.

1943
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,320
All we have is wallhacks, guys.

1944
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,040
Wait, I should have to do my...

1945
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,080
Wait, now I know why.

1946
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,760
You have to do your crosshair.

1947
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,260
Now I know why.

1948
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,260
Guys, wait.

1949
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,200
Wait, let me actually have a good...

1950
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,060
Guys, wait.

1951
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,380
Okay, show, set, don't show.

1952
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:44,700
Okay.

1953
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,980
Guys, wait.

1954
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,340
Wait, guys.

1955
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,640
I actually have to find my crosshair.

1956
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,980
Give me a sec.

1957
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,440
Give me a sec.

1958
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,660
I actually have to figure out my crosshair.

1959
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,860
Here we go.

1960
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,480
Guys.

1961
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,160
Give me a sec.

1962
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,880
I'm trying to figure out my crosshair right now.

1963
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:11,220
Okay.

1964
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,500
Here we go.

1965
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:15,840
Here we go.

1966
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,240
Now we have real aim.

1967
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:17,820
There we go.

1968
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,340
Now I'm good.

1969
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,260
Now I'm good, guys.

1970
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,300
Alright.

1971
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:25,330
Come on.

1972
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,170
Oh, he's scared.

1973
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:30,830
Come on.

1974
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:31,950
Let's move over here.

1975
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,450
Come on.

1976
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:33,470
Come on.

1977
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,990
You little bitch.

1978
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,610
You're such a little...

1979
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,250
Wow, just...

1980
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,470
That's a Q, right?

1981
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:49,030
Oh, fuck.

1982
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:49,290
Okay.

1983
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,190
Real aim time.

1984
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:51,990
That's right.

1985
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,010
Oh, shit.

1986
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:56,650
That's a Q, right?

1987
01:13:57,190 --> 01:13:58,270
That's right.

1988
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,830
This is how you actually hack.

1989
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,010
Oh, you missed, little baby.

1990
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:06,110
You missed, little boy.

1991
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:06,890
You missed.

1992
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:08,350
Missed.

1993
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:09,230
You missed again.

1994
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:10,930
No.

1995
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:11,970
No.

1996
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:13,070
No.

1997
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:14,030
No.

1998
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:17,310
Okay.

1999
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:18,850
It's fine.

2000
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:20,770
Oh, fuck.

2001
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:21,550
I missed too.

2002
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:23,270
There we go.

2003
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:24,130
I don't miss this.

2004
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:24,490
No.

2005
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:25,090
I missed.

2006
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,490
It's not fair.

2007
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:29,010
This is not fair.

2008
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,030
This is not fair.

2009
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:30,930
This is not fair.

2010
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:31,770
This is not fair.

2011
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:35,350
Bro, he's fucking...

2012
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,190
He's fucking body hopping.

2013
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:38,330
You fucker.

2014
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:40,090
You try hard.

2015
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:41,330
You're actually...

2016
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:43,930
Bro, he has CS.

2017
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,470
He has CS movement.

2018
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:49,510
How?

2019
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:52,370
That's a Q, right?

2020
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:56,090
Like, how do you have CS movement?

2021
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:00,450
I turned everything off.

2022
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:02,430
Everything's off.

2023
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:07,720
Oh, my God.

2024
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,280
My aimbot keeps going on and off because I forgot to turn it off.

2025
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:14,570
It's not working.

2026
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:15,170
My aimbot.

2027
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:18,510
I can't believe.

2028
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:20,850
Oh, my God.

2029
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:22,070
Oh, my God.

2030
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:22,410
Okay.

2031
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,310
Goodbye.

2032
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:27,130
Oh, my God.

2033
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:27,830
I better...

2034
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:29,450
I have actual aimers on my team.

2035
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:30,070
Oh, my God.

2036
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:30,830
They're not...

2037
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:33,370
They're all not compensating for something, guys.

2038
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:34,750
Is that crazy?

2039
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:36,050
Jesus.

2040
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,170
That's fucking...

2041
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:37,390
No.

2042
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,050
No.

2043
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:39,250
No.

2044
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:40,370
No.

2045
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:40,410
No.

2046
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:41,210
No.

2047
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:41,850
No.

2048
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:42,490
No.

2049
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:43,010
No.

2050
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:43,570
No.

2051
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:44,190
No.

2052
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:44,330
No.

2053
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:44,410
No.

2054
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:44,450
No.

2055
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:44,530
No.

2056
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:44,910
No.

2057
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:45,670
No.

2058
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:46,790
No.

2059
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:47,330
Oh, my God.

2060
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:47,850
That's fine.

2061
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:48,190
That's fine.

2062
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:48,610
That's fine.

2063
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:48,890
No.

2064
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:49,850
No.

2065
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:50,910
Fucking...

2066
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:51,850
It's so...

2067
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:53,170
They're like...

2068
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:54,390
That's crazy.

2069
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,690
I don't wanna fucking shoot him anymore.

2070
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,190
Oh, my God.

2071
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:06,030
They're actually B-hopping the second day.

2072
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:09,910
You still got him.

2073
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:11,270
Jesus.

2074
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:14,790
Oh, my God.

2075
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,610
He's trying to...

2076
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:17,790
Oh, my God.

2077
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:21,490
That's looking right.

2078
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:22,110
Get over here.

2079
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:25,570
Oh, my God.

2080
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:26,890
They're all looking at me.

2081
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:28,070
That's fucking right.

2082
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:28,610
Get off.

2083
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:30,490
Come on.

2084
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:31,030
Come on.

2085
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,330
Stand there.

2086
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:31,690
Come on.

2087
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,890
You know you want to.

2088
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:34,190
No!

2089
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,610
I told you.

2090
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:38,310
It's just...

2091
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:41,190
How the fuck do you even do that?

2092
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:43,970
How do you B-hop?

2093
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,490
I can't do it.

2094
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:48,590
Well, I can't do it now.

2095
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:49,850
Oh, no.

2096
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,350
This is lit.

2097
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:55,690
How the fuck do you B-hop?

2098
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:57,490
I've never B-hopped.

2099
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:59,290
I've never played CS before.

2100
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:01,130
Oh, never mind.

2101
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:01,770
I'm better.

2102
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,210
I'm better.

2103
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:05,770
I'm better.

2104
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:07,910
I'm so much better.

2105
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,650
Oh, my God.

2106
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:16,590
I can learn this.

2107
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:18,890
I can do this.

2108
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:20,890
I can do this.

2109
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:22,650
I can...

2110
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,190
Guys, am I doing it?

2111
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:25,650
Yes.

2112
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:27,890
This is how you do it, guys.

2113
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,830
You think I'm doing it?

2114
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:30,710
Wait.

2115
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:33,570
You think I'm doing it?

2116
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:33,890
No!

2117
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,710
Guys, I'm not doing it.

2118
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:38,690
Guys, I don't...

2119
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:41,410
I am absolutely not doing it, guys.

2120
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:42,890
I am...

2121
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:44,030
Bro!

2122
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:45,850
This is not fair!

2123
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:47,970
It's so fast!

2124
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,150
Fast!

2125
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:51,790
No.

2126
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:52,430
No.

2127
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:53,070
No!

2128
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:53,810
No!

2129
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:10,250
This is where I've been joked to death by it, but I'm just catching a stream.

2130
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,390
So, I'm not the T.

2131
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:15,750
You're not that guy, Toki.

2132
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:18,610
What a bunch of cheaters.

2133
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:20,550
Oh, my God.

2134
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:21,170
No!

2135
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,730
I thought...

2136
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:28,970
I don't know how to B-hop, guys.

2137
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:31,870
I don't know.

2138
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,350
No!

2139
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:37,290
Alright, guys.

2140
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:38,730
I'll be right back, guys.

2141
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,550
I need to use the bathroom, everybody.

2142
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:41,490
I'll be right back.

2143
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:53,010
I'm back.

2144
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:54,910
I'm back, everybody.

2145
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:56,490
I can't believe...

2146
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:57,390
I still think...

2147
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:05,850
I think it's so fucking funny when one of the guys was just B-hopping and my teammate just gave up and just threw a termite at him.

2148
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,750
Like, he wasn't even gonna shoot him anymore.

2149
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:08,550
He was...

2150
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:09,810
It's just like...

2151
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:10,890
Fuck that shit!

2152
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:13,990
Okay.

2153
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:17,490
I'm gonna make a new lobby in case there's new dragoons that wanna join.

2154
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,370
Alright.

2155
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:19,370
Host match.

2156
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:19,770
Okay.

2157
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:20,190
Oh.

2158
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:22,450
No cheats.

2159
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:28,410
No cheats.

2160
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:33,550
Wait, how do you...

2161
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:36,350
I have it on, but I don't know how to set it.

2162
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:39,210
It says auto B-hop.

2163
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:40,870
How does that work?

2164
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:44,190
How does auto B-hop work?

2165
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:47,650
Don't...

2166
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:49,390
How does that work?

2167
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:50,830
I don't know how it works.

2168
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:51,370
Hold space.

2169
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,210
Oh, the hold space bar.

2170
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:54,930
Bro, he's doing it legit.

2171
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:57,490
Bro, what the fuck?

2172
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:58,350
This is actual...

2173
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,430
They have actual CS?

2174
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:01,970
Oh my god.

2175
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:03,470
Bro, that guy's doing it legit.

2176
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,090
Cause cheats don't work in the lobby.

2177
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:07,230
There's no cheats in the lobby.

2178
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:10,810
He's just that good.

2179
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:13,610
Bro, the lobby has no cheats.

2180
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:15,190
Alright, alright.

2181
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:16,450
Let's do the settings.

2182
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:17,430
Okay, we...

2183
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,070
Alright, random.

2184
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:19,990
Alright, what do we wanna try this time?

2185
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:21,330
Okay, what did we do?

2186
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:23,410
We could do King of the Hill.

2187
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:25,130
Oh, King of the Hill might be fun.

2188
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:26,650
King of the Hill.

2189
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:27,530
Alright.

2190
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,630
I don't wanna do Raid Boss anymore.

2191
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:32,290
Raid Boss was not it, guys.

2192
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:32,790
Raid...

2193
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:38,610
Guys, Raid Boss was just not it.

2194
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,710
Alright, here we go.

2195
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:45,750
Alright, and that...

2196
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,630
We'll do another one of the...

2197
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,730
We'll do another one of the wallhacks only.

2198
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,140
Kill confirm is that after...

2199
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,060
Oh my god.

2200
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,120
Oh my god.

2201
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:00,640
I forgot.

2202
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:01,600
It's time.

2203
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,680
It's fucking time.

2204
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:04,780
Advance.

2205
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:06,760
Rage.

2206
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,760
Open cheat menu.

2207
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:11,480
Oh, fuck.

2208
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,860
This cheat menu is like so overwhelming.

2209
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,740
It's time.

2210
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,320
Oh my god, I'm doing it, guys.

2211
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:20,780
I'm bun...

2212
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:21,840
Am I bunny hopping?

2213
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,700
Guys, am I bunny hopping, guys?

2214
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:25,740
Am I...

2215
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,900
Guys, is this bunny hopping?

2216
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:35,820
Guys.

2217
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:38,680
Guys, am I doing it?

2218
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:39,900
Guys, am I...

2219
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:40,120
What?

2220
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,220
No, yes I am!

2221
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,360
Yes I am!

2222
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:51,600
Please look at me.

2223
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,260
Guys, you don't understand.

2224
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,280
How do you do it?

2225
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,120
I gotta lower the spin.

2226
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,080
It's too much.

2227
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:02,740
Okay.

2228
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:05,440
The spin is a little bit too much.

2229
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,300
But I'll turn on the pitch.

2230
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:09,960
The knife is so scary, guys.

2231
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,260
Guys, I don't think they realize what king of the hill is.

2232
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,100
I don't...

2233
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,620
I don't think they...

2234
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,660
Oh no, he's coming.

2235
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,140
He's coming.

2236
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,180
Oh no.

2237
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,540
That's right.

2238
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,980
Can't even get out of spawn.

2239
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,460
That's fucking right.

2240
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:31,220
That's easiest win of my life.

2241
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:33,500
They don't know it's king of the hill.

2242
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,220
Easiest...

2243
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:35,740
You know what?

2244
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,500
I'm gonna drop a u-tail.

2245
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:38,720
Boom.

2246
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,220
Boom.

2247
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,800
I don't know where it's going.

2248
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,500
Oh shit.

2249
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,120
Spin me right around, right around.

2250
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,420
Nice u-tail.

2251
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,380
Oh no, they figured out the game.

2252
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,120
Guys.

2253
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,780
They figured out the game, guys.

2254
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,180
Oh no.

2255
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:01,860
Don't worry.

2256
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,780
Oh my god.

2257
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,760
The csgoer is playing.

2258
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:06,980
He's using an AWP.

2259
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,340
That fucking cheater.

2260
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:11,500
It's okay.

2261
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:12,520
It's okay.

2262
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,080
Okay, no more spin.

2263
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:17,220
Guys, I don't think I'm ready for spin, guys.

2264
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,300
I don't...

2265
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,460
I don't think I'm ready.

2266
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,000
What's silent aim?

2267
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:27,940
Oh, silent aim is making so that it's not like I'm cheating.

2268
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,280
But like, what's the point?

2269
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,460
I'm raging right now.

2270
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,920
Alright, here we go.

2271
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:34,340
Alright.

2272
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:36,560
This is fine.

2273
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,760
No more spin time.

2274
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,020
So you spin out of this.

2275
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:43,620
Guys, he's...

2276
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,080
Guys.

2277
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,520
Guys, I think he...

2278
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:48,380
Guys.

2279
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:54,110
Oh, I'm coming for you.

2280
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,790
Guys, leave one for me.

2281
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,930
Leave him to me.

2282
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:59,750
That's fucking right.

2283
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,920
Guys, surround him.

2284
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,940
No, I forgot I put the Jackson up in the city.

2285
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,760
I didn't realize it was time.

2286
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,420
I didn't realize it was time.

2287
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,280
I wanted to get out.

2288
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:22,340
No.

2289
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:23,440
I

2290
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:29,490
didn't realize.

2291
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:33,490
I'm so mad.

2292
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:34,770
No.

2293
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:37,670
Too much BM.

2294
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:39,330
No.

2295
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:43,010
It's not fair.

2296
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:45,290
It's not...

2297
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:46,630
I'm gonna fucking shank you.

2298
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:52,090
Alright, it's time.

2299
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:52,590
Guys.

2300
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:55,510
It's time to play a real game now.

2301
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,230
It's legit mode time.

2302
01:26:57,570 --> 01:26:58,730
Alright, what is it?

2303
01:26:58,850 --> 01:26:59,590
Is it team death?

2304
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:00,230
It should be.

2305
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:01,950
Sniper only.

2306
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:03,130
Oh.

2307
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:04,210
Wait.

2308
01:27:04,410 --> 01:27:04,990
Kill confirmed.

2309
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:06,130
Let's do kill confirmed.

2310
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:07,890
Real.

2311
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,030
It's real time.

2312
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,630
We're doing real game.

2313
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:13,070
One, two.

2314
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:13,730
Guys.

2315
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:14,290
Wait.

2316
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:15,050
Do we have ten?

2317
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:17,970
I don't know if this is like a bug or we do have ten people.

2318
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:18,770
Do we have ten people?

2319
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:21,390
One, two, three, four, five.

2320
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:21,710
Guys.

2321
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:22,810
Stand still, guys.

2322
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:24,010
Everybody in the line.

2323
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:26,170
Every dragoon in the line.

2324
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:27,190

2325
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:29,050
Here.

2326
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:30,150
Follow the square.

2327
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:32,770
Everyone in the line so I can count you all.

2328
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:33,510
Guys.

2329
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:34,930
Everyone in the line.

2330
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,110
Stand in the line.

2331
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:38,150
Stand in the line.

2332
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,130
Guys, this is not a fucking line.

2333
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:40,590
Okay.

2334
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:41,230
Start here.

2335
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:42,450
You all get a square.

2336
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,370
You all get a square so I can count properly.

2337
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:46,390
All of you.

2338
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,550
Stand on your own respective square.

2339
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:49,830
Stand in...

2340
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:50,070
Someone.

2341
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:50,910
Move.

2342
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,850
Move to the square.

2343
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:52,790
There's an empty square.

2344
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:53,190
That's right.

2345
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:53,610
Move.

2346
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:54,090
Move.

2347
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,410
Everybody in their square.

2348
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,430
Everybody in your...

2349
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:57,650

2350
01:27:57,930 --> 01:27:58,410
Move.

2351
01:27:58,790 --> 01:27:59,270
Move to this.

2352
01:27:59,330 --> 01:27:59,810
That's right.

2353
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:00,110
Alright.

2354
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:00,970
You move here.

2355
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:02,090
Alright.

2356
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:03,270
And then we're all...

2357
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:04,230
Do we all have a square?

2358
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:05,270
Guys.

2359
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:06,270
Guys.

2360
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:07,170
Stop.

2361
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:07,510
Move.

2362
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:08,750
Move back to your square.

2363
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:09,490
Guys.

2364
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:09,890
Okay.

2365
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:10,290
Alright.

2366
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:11,270
You.

2367
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:12,090
Move here.

2368
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:12,630
You.

2369
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:13,070
Okay.

2370
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:13,670
One.

2371
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:17,710
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2372
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:18,290
Alright.

2373
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:19,650
We're missing one dragoon.

2374
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:21,510
It's like you're eating cat.

2375
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:22,050
Alright.

2376
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:23,150
You guys all stay here.

2377
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:23,910
Guys.

2378
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:24,930
We're missing one more.

2379
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:27,290
We need one more dragoon to join us.

2380
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:28,550
Guys.

2381
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:30,350
Stay in your square, guys.

2382
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,210
Don't leave your square.

2383
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:33,490
Stay in your square.

2384
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:34,630
You all...

2385
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:36,350
This is your designated square.

2386
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:38,270
This is a jailbreak.

2387
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,170
How do you guys still have util?

2388
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:42,630
I don't even have util anymore.

2389
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:43,610
Alright.

2390
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:44,050
Guys.

2391
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:44,470
Alright.

2392
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:45,850
Actually, just one person.

2393
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:47,010
Just one person.

2394
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:47,690
One team.

2395
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:50,010
It's not going to be my team.

2396
01:28:50,230 --> 01:28:50,970
That's fine.

2397
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:52,170
That's fine.

2398
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,670
One team is just not going to have...

2399
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:57,270
One team is just going to have four people instead of five.

2400
01:28:57,390 --> 01:28:58,410
And it's not going to be mine.

2401
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:04,990
And they hid it.

2402
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:05,290
Alright.

2403
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:05,810
Here we go.

2404
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:07,250
Guys.

2405
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:08,430
We only have walls.

2406
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:09,010
Wait.

2407
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:11,310
Wait.

2408
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:12,590
My team is a one with four.

2409
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:13,150
Wait.

2410
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:13,750
That's...

2411
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,010
Wait a minute.

2412
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:16,790
Wait a minute.

2413
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:17,670
My team is a one with four.

2414
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:18,770
My team is a one with four.

2415
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:20,150
Oh, fuck.

2416
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:21,630
I don't know how to use the off.

2417
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:24,070
I don't know how to use the a.

2418
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:25,790
Wait a minute.

2419
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:27,450
Oh, I forgot.

2420
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:28,450
Wait.

2421
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:29,770
Wait.

2422
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:30,970
I don't play...

2423
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:32,070
Guys, I'm so...

2424
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:32,650
Oh, shit!

2425
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:35,610
Guys, it's fine.

2426
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:37,790
Guys.

2427
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:41,010
Guys, I don't know how to...

2428
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,810
Guys, I don't know how...

2429
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:43,430
Guys, no.

2430
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:44,430
Don't let him talk!

2431
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:50,330
I don't know, I forgot I don't play CS!

2432
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:53,570
Okay, nice.

2433
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:56,250
Oh no, oh no.

2434
01:29:56,710 --> 01:29:59,270
Oh no, the Bhopper, he's getting closer.

2435
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:00,910
Guys, okay, cover me.

2436
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:02,950
Cover me guys, I'm going for it.

2437
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:05,070
Cover me.

2438
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:07,510
Oh my god, nice.

2439
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:10,570
Oh my god, he's coming.

2440
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:12,650
Guys, guys, he's Bhopping.

2441
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:16,410
Guys, guys, he's fucking CS surfing right now.

2442
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:20,330
Guys, guys, what if we all knife each other?

2443
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:21,570
It would be so funny.

2444
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:26,450
Guys, how do I, how do I use the AK, guys?

2445
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:28,170
I don't play tactical.

2446
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:29,790
Okay, alright.

2447
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:31,030
It's time.

2448
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:32,690
It's time.

2449
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:37,290
A real hack aim, a real waller would use a sniper at that point.

2450
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:41,790
Guys, why don't we all just start knifing each other, guys?

2451
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:42,730
Wouldn't that be funny?

2452
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:43,810
No!

2453
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:51,790
Guys, I don't.

2454
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:53,090

2455
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:56,230
Guys, guys, he's coming for me!

2456
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:57,990
Oh shit, I'm fucking gaming.

01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:59,670
I'm a gamer.

2458
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:02,270
Wait, what the fuck?

Oh, that's it, you're it.

01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:10,290
Oh, that's right!

2462

Oh shit!

2463
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:14,790

2468
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:23,170
No!

2469
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:23,690

2471
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,820
We're all gonna start knifing.

2472
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:38,060
Wait, is that actually Cody?

2473
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:41,540

Guys, it's knifing.

No honor if you don't knife!

2492
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:20,640
No honor!

2493
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:21,800

2494
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,320

2503
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:52,090
Welcome to London!

2504
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:55,600
You're right, Cody.

2505
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,500
You're so right.

2506
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,260
You're so fucking right.

2507
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,920
You're so right.

01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:16,090
Don't let them get me!

2512
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:17,110
That's so cute.

2513
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:33,210
He's like, fuck you.

2514
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,670
Cody doesn't care anymore.

2515
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:38,030
He doesn't care.

2516
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:41,130
He brought a gun to a knife fight.

2517
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:43,170
America.

2518
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:48,730
Don't let them get you!

2519
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:52,490

2520
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:55,590
He even brought a gun to London, that's crazy.

2521
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:57,490
Bro, he's so fast!

2522
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:58,770

2531
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:13,670
He crossed the pie.

2532
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:16,690
Alright, that's the key, right?

2533
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:19,350
That's right, this time.

2534
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:21,490
That's right.

2535
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:26,570
That's right, get out of here.

2536
01:34:26,910 --> 01:34:28,870
Get out of here.

2537
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,090
We did it.

2538
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:35,590
We fucking did it.

2539
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:39,910
Nice.

2540
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:41,610
Oh shit, okay.

2541
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:44,750
Now that Cody's here, let's do something.

2542
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:45,170
Wait.

2543
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:46,850
Alright, alright, alright.

2544
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:49,130
Let's do actual rage now.

2545
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:53,170
Let's do rage and we'll do a capture the flag.

2546
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:55,950
And then, oh my god, alright.

2547
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,750
Capture the- what the fuck is this profile picture?

2548
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:00,590
Wait,

2549
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:05,830

2550
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:07,090
Okay, wait.

2551
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:12,990
I'll put- Wait, how do I switch to random?

2552
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:15,490
Wait, how do I manually swap people?

2553
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:17,370
Oh well, I don't really care that much.

2554
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:18,050
Alright.

2555
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:26,730
Is that- is that like who- who's the fuck?

2556
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:27,010
Okay.

2557
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:32,890
Alright, here we go.

2558
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:34,270
Real hacking time.

2559
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:36,890
It's hacking time.

2560
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:39,690
It's time.

2561
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:41,490
Let's capture the flag.

2562
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:44,090
Oh my god, you too.

2563
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:47,630
That's fucking right.

01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:50,950
Welcome to you jiggle peeping bitch.

Oh my god, Manny, you're fucking- oh no, not the util!

01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:12,420
Stupid util, stupid fucking util.

01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,600
Stupid fucking- Guys, we need to get the flag.

2569
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,580
Guys, how we gonna get the flag, guys?

2570
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:23,120
No, the util!

2571
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,520
Typical cheaters.

2572
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:30,980
Use a util.

2573
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,990
Fight me like a real cheater.

2574
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,480
Guns only.

2575
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,060
Guns only.

2576
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:40,760
No!

2577
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:42,770
Oh my god.

2578
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:49,060
No one is- because we need to make it to the flag, guys.

2579
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,300
How we gonna make it to the flag?

2580
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:54,820
Nice.

2581
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:56,260
That's how.

2582
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,340
That's fucking how.

2583
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,720
Don't worry, I've got this.

2584
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,500
I'll be the hero that you cannot- that you can't be.

2585
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:09,120
Oh my god, they're putting walls up.

2586
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,220
They're building walls, guys.

2587
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:13,060
Oh my god, I don't think he knows I'm reloading.

2588
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,280
That's fucking right.

2589
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:23,840
Nothing!

2590
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,940
I can't believe you would camp.

2591
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:28,620
No honor.

2592
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,600
No fucking honor right there.

2593
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,300
Oh my god, not the nade.

2594
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,040
Not the nade.

2595
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:36,200
No, not two nades.

2596
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:37,300
Not three nades.

2597
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:37,840
No.

2598
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:41,960
I can't believe- you already have hats, why are you camping?

2599
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:49,500
Wait, are flags being taken?

2600
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,760
We gotta get our flag back.

2601
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:53,940
Get our flag- wait, what is this?

2602
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,460
Okay, got our flag back.

2603
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,300
I'm using a new gun.

2604
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:59,480
I don't know if it's better, but it has more bullets.

2605
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,780
Okay, it's not better, guys.

2606
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,600
Alright, guys, I get it.

2607
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:03,300
It's off time.

2608
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:06,620
Guys, it was definitely not better, guys.

2609
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:09,720
It was definitely not better.

2610
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,980
It was not better at all.

2611
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,660
Oh my god, stupid util users.

2612
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,640
What?!

2613
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,100
How am I losing?!

2614
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,200
We're all cheating!

2615
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,120
No!

2616
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:33,980
Win!

2617
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,820
We can't win!

2618
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,720
We just need one point!

2619
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:43,720
Wait, they scored?!

2620
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:48,840
They're so good.

2621
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:51,220
Oh my god, wait.

2622
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,020
Wait, that's a CS player.

2623
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,540
That's a fucking CS player.

2624
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:59,400
No, I almost made it!

2625
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:00,900
I almost made it!

2626
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,200
I actually- Oh my god, I saw her bhop.

2627
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,480
I saw that person bhop.

2628
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,560
They're actual CS players.

2629
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:09,980
That's not fair.

2630
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,980
That's actually not fair.

2631
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,940
That's- oh my god, they actually play CS!

2632
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:19,260
I saw them bhop.

2633
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,520
I can't believe it.

2634
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,480
I know they hack in CS.

2635
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,880
They know the tech.

2636
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:37,420
Some people actually- Guys, we gotta go in together, guys.

2637
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,300
It's right- oh my god, he's a king.

2638
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:44,540
Oh my god, oh my god, he's a king.

2639
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:46,600
Oh my god, he's bad.

2640
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:48,480
He's actually doing it.

2641
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,520
He's a guy- No!

2642
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:54,080
We were so close!

2643
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:56,140
It was right there!

2644
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:58,100
Please.

2645
01:39:58,520 --> 01:39:59,480
Please, we can tie.

2646
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,360
Please, I don't want to get bad hammered.

2647
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:02,660
Please.

2648
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,320
Please don't bad hammer me, please.

2649
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,500
Please, 20 seconds.

2650
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:11,140
We can do this.

2651
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,660
We can do this.

2652
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:13,220
I got one.

2653
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:17,100
Oh, I- Okay, we got two.

2654
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,080
No!

2655
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:20,040
The goddammit!

2656
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:24,710
No.

2657
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:26,950
I just gotta hide.

2658
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:28,550
I just gotta hide.

2659
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:30,970
I just gotta hide.

2660
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:33,730
Oh my god, they can't make it.

2661
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:35,810
They won't be able to find me.

2662
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:39,790
Oh, they won't be able to- No, why are you here?

2663
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:40,930
Why are you here?

2664
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:42,130
Oh, no.

2665
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,840
No, they're not here.

2666
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:48,580
Oh, no.

2667
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,120
No, they don't know!

2668
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,000
No!

2669
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:52,840
No!

2670
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:53,680
No!

2671
01:40:56,710 --> 01:40:57,530
Oh, thank god!

2672
01:40:57,870 --> 01:40:59,150
He took me out of my misery.

2673
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:01,330
They know.

2674
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:03,550
They have lost.

2675
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:05,230
Okay, of course.

2676
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:07,230
No, they don't know.

2677
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:08,230
Guys.

2678
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:13,310
I don't know.

2679
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:17,390
I thought that maybe they would know, guys.

2680
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:21,090
I thought that maybe they would know.

2681
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:25,270
I don't know.

2682
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:28,750
I thought maybe I'd be free.

2683
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:32,330
It didn't.

2684
01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:34,030
It didn't matter.

2685
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:35,630
Oh, man.

2686
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:41,450
I wish I could make it so I could tell who gets to be the raid boss.

2687
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:44,370
I can assign a raid boss, but I think it goes to Mjolnir.

2688
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:46,730
That was fucked up.

2689
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:50,070
That was so fucked up when it went to me.

2690
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:53,230
Alright, what if we do legit?

2691
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:54,390
Okay, what do we do, guys?

2692
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:57,170
Guys, what do we want?

2693
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:58,750
No, raid boss was not it.

2694
01:41:59,130 --> 01:42:00,650
Raid boss was actually not it.

2695
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:01,810
That was so fucked up.

2696
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:05,410
That was so fucked up, guys.

2697
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:08,290
Everyone just... Oh, my God.

2698
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:09,170
Okay, we'll do two.

2699
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,430
We'll do two raid bosses, okay?

2700
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:12,510
Alright.

2701
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:14,490
One raid.

2702
01:42:14,610 --> 01:42:14,830
Okay.

2703
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:16,290
But how do I make it?

2704
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:19,070
How do I... Okay, I'll do two.

2705
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:22,010
Wait, two raid bosses.

2706
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:23,730
Alright.

2707
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:25,590
I'll do it.

2708
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:25,930
Okay.

2709
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:27,470
He wants it?

2710
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:27,770
Alright.

2711
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:29,270
One versus all.

2712
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:30,690
Well, it's two versus all now.

2713
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:36,430
It's two versus all.

2714
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:39,190
That one versus all was not it.

2715
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:42,110
Oh, he's angry.

2716
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:45,990
Oh, wait.

2717
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:46,810
Who's the boss?

2718
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:48,490
Oh, it's not us.

2719
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:49,810
Guys.

2720
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:51,510
Guys, it's not us.

2721
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:52,610
We are... Oh, guys.

2722
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:55,450
Guys, we gotta use util.

2723
01:42:56,330 --> 01:42:59,510
Guys, we gotta use util, guys.

2724
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:03,270
Guys.

2725
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:05,090
Guys, it's not it.

2726
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:09,290
Guys.

2727
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:11,110
Guys, there's two of them.

2728
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:13,010
It's actually a lot harder now that there's two of them.

2729
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:13,630
Guys.

2730
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:14,350
Guys.

2731
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:20,130
Guys, we gotta work together, guys.

2732
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,570
Use the util, guys.

2733
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:24,810
Guys, use the util.

2734
01:43:25,190 --> 01:43:25,530
No!

2735
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:30,970
What are you looking at, huh?

2736
01:43:31,530 --> 01:43:32,590
What are you looking at?

2737
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:36,970
Guys, we're not... Guys, we're not making it out of spawn.

2738
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:43,370
Oh, we did it!

2739
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:45,650
Kill them!

2740
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:46,690
Oh, we died.

2741
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:48,310
We died.

2742
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:50,890
I'm trying my best!

2743
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:52,970
I'm trying my best!

2744
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:55,210
Guys, we got it.

2745
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:57,810
Wait, they scored?

2746
01:43:58,770 --> 01:44:00,370
Guys, we just lost.

2747
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,050
Oh, no.

2748
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:05,090
Guys, how did we lose?

2749
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:10,350
Guys, how did we lose?

2750
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:13,810
Guys, no!

2751
01:44:14,670 --> 01:44:14,670
No!

2752
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:15,470
No!

2753
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:16,570
Oh, they

2754
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,900
forgot!

2755
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:22,940
They forgot!

2756
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:26,360
Okay, let's do one.

2757
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:27,660
One.

2758
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:29,180
Guys, we figured it out.

2759
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,380
We just have one raid boss.

2760
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:32,980
Guys,

2761
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:38,920
just one raid boss.

2762
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:42,320
Okay, one raid boss and it won't be me.

2763
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:44,900
I hope to God it won't be me, guys.

2764
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,480
I cannot be a raid boss again.

2765
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:47,260
I can't.

2766
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,000
Please.

2767
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,220
Please, I can't do it again.

2768
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,280
Okay, we got this.

2769
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,140
It's one person.

2770
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:00,160
It's one person, guys.

2771
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:02,760
It's... It's one person.

2772
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,100
There's no way.

2773
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:05,600
It's one person.

2774
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:08,960
It's one guy.

2775
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:14,280
It's one guy.

2776
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,360
He can't get us all.

2777
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,260
We'll do it until Coney gets it.

2778
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:23,460
Oh, fuck.

2779
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:23,820
Okay.

2780
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,020
Guys, it's fine.

2781
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:26,040
Guys, it's okay.

2782
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:27,280
There's so many of us.

2783
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,620
Guys, there's so many of us.

2784
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:30,120
It's okay.

2785
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:30,960
We got this.

2786
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:31,800
It's one guy.

2787
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,580
It's one guy.

2788
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:38,480
Guys, guys, don't burn yourself, guys.

2789
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:39,260
It's one guy.

2790
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,660
I tell Coney I'm gonna do this until he gets raid boss.

2791
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:51,360
That's right.

2792
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:52,920
Let's get him.

2793
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,840
Let's fucking get him.

2794
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,740
That's the key, right?

2795
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,700
Oh, I have...

2796
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:03,120
Oh my god, you can wallbang that?

2797
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:05,720
You can fucking wallbang that?

2798
01:46:09,790 --> 01:46:11,330
Yeah, but I got him.

2799
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:11,890
I got him.

2800
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:12,830
Aim botter down.

2801
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:15,170
You can't get the flag now, bitch.

2802
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:16,550
That's right.

2803
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:20,450
All that CS training is not gonna help you now, fucker.

2804
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:21,730
Oh shit.

2805
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:22,970
Oh shit, my one bullet.

2806
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:23,610
My one...

2807
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:26,850
No, my one bullet.

2808
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:30,470
He says no thank you.

2809
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:32,670
No, I want him.

2810
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:35,630
I want an experienced raid boss.

2811
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:39,550
That was so fucked up when I had to do it.

2812
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:44,930
Where the fuck is... Wait, what?

2813
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:49,170
Oh my god, he's just BRB.

2814
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:51,570
Wait, guys, stop it.

2815
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:53,130
He's so... Oh shit.

2816
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:55,250
Bro, what the fuck?

2817
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:58,810
It's just... Guys, we can't let him have the flag.

2818
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:00,630
Guys, bro, he's just...

2819
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:02,570
He's just...

2820
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:06,590
We can't catch him.

2821
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:07,590
Oh no.

2822
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:09,350
Guys, we can't catch him.

2823
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:10,170
He's so fast.

2824
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:13,990
He's just... Oh my god, he's so fast.

2825
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:16,430
Oh my god.

2826
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:17,950
It's not fair.

2827
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:20,150
Where's our other CS player?

2828
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:21,710
Where is he?

2829
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,320
Jesus Christ, all he does is B.

2830
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,660
Bro, we can't catch him.

2831
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,460
Jesus Christ.

2832
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,760
It's okay, he can't B-hop forever.

2833
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:45,860
Wait, wait, wait.

2834
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:49,780
Wait, maybe he can.

2835
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:52,060
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

2836
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:54,420
Oh god, he just smacked

2837
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:01,250
home.

2838
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:03,590
Yes, he can.

2839
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:07,430
Oh my god, that's crazy.

2840
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:10,470
Bro, that man almost did it.

2841
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:14,310
He can, in fact, B-hop forever.

2842
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:18,150
Yay.

2843
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,130
Yes, we can.

2844
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:26,110
That's crazy.

2845
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:35,390
That guy was the ultimate cheetah.

2846
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:37,690
That guy was actually insane.

2847
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:39,230
Oh my god.

2848
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:42,510
Bro had the strats.

2849
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:47,610
Alright guys, we're gonna do this lobby until Kony gets Rain Boss.

2850
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:50,790
Yeah, he almost won.

2851
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:53,730
That was insane that he almost won.

2852
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,830
That's fucking crazy.

2853
01:48:57,610 --> 01:49:00,830
It's not so loud, bro.

2854
01:49:01,030 --> 01:49:01,370
Thanks.

2855
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:04,290
I turned the timer down.

2856
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:08,070
Alright, two minutes.

2857
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:09,650
Alright.

2858
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:10,710
Alright, Kony.

2859
01:49:11,830 --> 01:49:13,070
Wait, did Kony?

2860
01:49:13,170 --> 01:49:13,950
No, he's still here.

2861
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:14,870
It's just bugged.

2862
01:49:14,890 --> 01:49:15,710
See, he's right here.

2863
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:22,510
I wish we could make it so I could automatically give him Rain Boss.

2864
01:49:22,610 --> 01:49:23,610
Alright, let's see if this works.

2865
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:26,690
Alright, let's see if Kony gets it.

2866
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:29,510
That's crazy.

2867
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:31,890
That's not fair.

2868
01:49:32,030 --> 01:49:33,730
He has years of CS experience.

2869
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:34,310
No!

2870
01:49:36,050 --> 01:49:36,730
No!

2871
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:38,570
Get me out!

2872
01:49:38,930 --> 01:49:41,090
Get me out!

2873
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:42,490
How do I end this?

2874
01:49:42,550 --> 01:49:42,930
No!

2875
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:48,950
Oh no.

2876
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:50,290
Not again.

2877
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:54,910
No!

2878
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:55,690
No!

2879
01:49:58,630 --> 01:49:59,670
Not again!

2880
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:02,510
Not again!

2881
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:05,590
Oh fuck, not again!

2882
01:50:05,690 --> 01:50:06,290
Not again!

2883
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:12,340
No, I can't do this one!

2884
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:18,390
Oh my god, I need...

2885
01:50:18,390 --> 01:50:19,130
Oh my god.

2886
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:20,670
Oh no.

2887
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:22,630
Oh no, get me out of here.

2888
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:24,070
Get me out of this hell.

2889
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:26,250
Get me out of this hell.

2890
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:26,990
No!

2891
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:29,270
Get me out!

2892
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:31,910
Wait, I know the strat.

2893
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:34,850
Guys, am I bee hopping?

2894
01:50:43,910 --> 01:50:44,510
Wait,

2895
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:48,410
give me a sec.

2896
01:50:48,650 --> 01:50:50,590
Guys, give me a sec.

2897
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:52,030
Guys, it's time.

2898
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:53,750
Guys.

2899
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:56,690
Guys.

2900
01:50:56,810 --> 01:50:57,470
Guys, let me, please.

2901
01:50:58,170 --> 01:50:58,830
Guys, please.

2902
01:50:59,510 --> 01:51:00,030
Guys.

2903
01:51:01,670 --> 01:51:02,610
Guys, please.

2904
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:03,390
Guys, please.

2905
01:51:04,010 --> 01:51:04,530
Please!

2906
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:07,710
Please!

2907
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:14,590
Here we go.

2908
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:16,110
Here we go.

2909
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:17,570
There we go.

2910
01:51:17,670 --> 01:51:20,910
They can't get all of me.

2911
01:51:21,410 --> 01:51:21,810
It's fine.

2912
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:23,170
Here we go.

2913
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:24,450
Guys, am I bee hopping?

2914
01:51:28,230 --> 01:51:29,830
It's happening!

2915
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:32,130
It's happening!

2916
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:44,730
They trapped me!

2917
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:47,010
No!

2918
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:49,770
No!

2919
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:51,070
I'm trapped!

2920
01:51:51,810 --> 01:51:52,490
No!

2921
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:54,090
No!

2922
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:55,430
Stop!

2923
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:56,770
Don't look at me!

2924
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:58,790
Stop looking at me!

2925
01:51:58,790 --> 01:51:59,990
Stop!

2926
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:01,090
No!

2927
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:10,580
I got spawned.

2928
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:15,700
Why can't Cody be the rainbow?

2929
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:18,400
It's not fair!

2930
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:25,160
I just want Cody to experience this hell.

2931
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,340
Thank you for the super chat.

2932
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:31,460
Give it to Cody!

2933
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,080
Why is it always me?

2934
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:38,820
Tell Cody to make the lobby.

2935
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,000
No more.

2936
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,460
No more funny mode.

2937
01:52:45,180 --> 01:52:45,540
Alright.

2938
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,680
What do we guys want?

2939
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:50,760
What do we want, guys?

2940
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,580
What do we want?

2941
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:56,120
Guys, what should we do next?

2942
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:58,220
Where is one shot?

2943
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:00,640
Legit?

2944
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:01,340
Okay, legit.

2945
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:02,960
All rage?

2946
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,260
All rage?

2947
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:06,540
One shot does not matter.

2948
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:07,140
Everybody.

2949
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:08,960
Sniper...

2950
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,240
We did sniper only.

2951
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:11,780
With...

2952
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:15,300
We did sniper only already.

2953
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:17,180
We already did sniper only.

2954
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:20,320
We did all of it, I'm pretty sure.

2955
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:21,940
But do we want legit or...

2956
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:23,540
We can do king of the hill legit.

2957
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:25,280
Or rage.

2958
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,880
Do we do rage or king of the hill?

2959
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:29,560
Guys, what do we do?

2960
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:35,840
One shot rage is super fun.

2961
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:36,980
Okay, one shot?

2962
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:38,260
Okay, one shot.

2963
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:44,360
One shot, king of the hill.

2964
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:48,320
One shot, king of the hill or legit king of the hill?

2965
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:51,500
What does Cody want?

2966
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:53,220
What does Cody want?

2967
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:02,540
Inside the lobby.

2968
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,540
What does he want?

2969
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:09,800
I can't believe he's in my lobby.

2970
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,720
Okay, we're doing...

2971
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,040
It depends on rage.

2972
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:17,920
If it's rage, then I have to be on third person because I can't fucking...

2973
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,840
I can't aim bot when I'm like first person.

2974
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:24,820
It just feels so fucking...

2975
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:27,020
He's still learning?

2976
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:28,060
Down for anything?

2977
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:31,380
Alright, we'll do rage, king of the hill.

2978
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,340
One shot, random.

2979
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:36,920
How do you learn the game?

2980
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,340
He's not learning!

2981
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:40,760
We're all cheating!

2982
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:46,380
What do you mean learn the game?

2983
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,800
We're all fucking hacking.

2984
01:54:53,890 --> 01:54:55,430
Like, what do you mean?

2985
01:54:55,630 --> 01:54:56,870
We're all hacking.

2986
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:02,850
He's ass at cheating.

2987
01:55:02,850 --> 01:55:05,810
How do you mean ass at cheating?

2988
01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:07,510
Just jiggle peek.

2989
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:12,670
Oh shit.

2990
01:55:13,650 --> 01:55:15,490
I fucked up already.

2991
01:55:18,410 --> 01:55:19,590
Wait, what?

2992
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:20,570
You use shield?

2993
01:55:21,850 --> 01:55:22,390
No!

2994
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:26,290
You too!

2995
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:28,710
You fucking cheater.

2996
01:55:29,950 --> 01:55:31,390
He used you too.

2997
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:33,510
Fucking freak.

2998
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:34,590
Oh no.

2999
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:37,650
I already used my one bullet and I double clicked on accident.

3000
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,920
I can't believe he...

3001
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:54,570
That's like, you're right, you fucker.

3002
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:00,110
Worth.

3003
01:56:05,150 --> 01:56:07,950
They have the actual CS player!

3004
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:08,170
They're here!

3005
01:56:12,110 --> 01:56:13,570
They're using you too!

3006
01:56:13,990 --> 01:56:14,330
Guys!

3007
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:15,170
F2P!

3008
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:18,210
Are you trying to say he's a better CS player than you, F2P?

3009
01:56:18,610 --> 01:56:19,930
Is that what you're trying to say?

3010
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:20,990
Oh wait, no, he's doing it.

3011
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:22,530
He's nerfing them all.

3012
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:25,490
Oh my god, F2P!

3013
01:56:26,150 --> 01:56:27,930
Oh my god, okay, F2P!

3014
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:29,130
Put your hacks on!

3015
01:56:29,570 --> 01:56:31,270
F2P, put your hacks on!

3016
01:56:32,050 --> 01:56:33,190
That's like, you're right, bitch.

3017
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:35,630
Oh my god, fuck, I'm the bitch.

3018
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:40,810
Oh my god.

3019
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:43,390
F2P, you have to...

3020
01:56:43,810 --> 01:56:45,290
Put on the gun, it's time!

3021
01:56:46,030 --> 01:56:47,170
Be the rock, Lee!

3022
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:48,790
Put down your weights!

3023
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:53,850
It's time to put down the weights, F2P!

3024
01:56:53,970 --> 01:56:54,990
And get that gun out!

3025
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:56,310
It's time!

3026
01:56:56,410 --> 01:56:58,050
This is the moment you've been waiting for!

3027
01:56:58,230 --> 01:56:59,250
That's fucking right, Cody.

3028
01:57:00,170 --> 01:57:01,170
That's fucking right.

3029
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:02,590
This is it.

3030
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:04,170
Get that gun!

3031
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:06,230
It's time!

3032
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:12,470
Oh my god, he's doing it!

3033
01:57:12,730 --> 01:57:15,930
Oh my god, he's using his 10 plus years of CS!

3034
01:57:16,490 --> 01:57:18,150
This is the moment he's been waiting...

3035
01:57:18,150 --> 01:57:20,070
Oh my god, go F2P!

3036
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:20,930
Go!

3037
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:22,990
Go be crazy!

3038
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:24,930
That's exactly right!

3039
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:27,330
Oh my god, kill everybody!

3040
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:31,590
Oh shit, oh shit.

3041
01:57:31,590 --> 01:57:33,870
I only have a knife now.

3042
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:35,530
No!

3043
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:41,740
1v6 them all!

3044
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,500
Oh no, he's dead.

3045
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:44,360
He's cracked.

3046
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:47,520
They have Mama Rin, we have F2P.

3047
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:49,860
The two fucking bhoppers.

3048
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:55,920
Oh no, oh no.

3049
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:57,140
No, F2P!

3050
01:57:57,460 --> 01:57:59,260
No, this is not how it's supposed to go!

3051
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:03,580
This is not how it's supposed to go, F2P!

3052
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:06,700
They're getting the...

3053
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:07,720
Oh my god, it's sad.

3054
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:10,700
Oh my god, he's so good.

3055
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,680
He's actually so good.

3056
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:14,220
What do I do?

3057
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:15,340
No!

3058
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,040
They're gonna do it!

3059
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:23,320
Oh no.

3060
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:25,620
Oh fuck.

3061
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:29,160
He's doing it.

3062
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:30,540
Gotta lock in.

3063
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:34,360
No, he locked in before me!

3064
01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:35,940
Oh no.

3065
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:37,540
Oh no, F2P, this is it.

3066
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:39,660
This is your carry, our 1v5!

3067
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:40,400
No!

3068
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:45,700
No, they're in A6!

3069
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:47,840
Oh my god, no!

3070
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:52,720
Oh my god, we got two.

3071
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,600
Oh my god, 2P, this is it, this is your character arc.

3072
01:58:56,940 --> 01:58:57,480
This is it.

3073
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,460
This is it.

3074
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:03,720
This is it, this is it!

3075
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:14,360
We got it back.

3076
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:17,700
Oh no, it's just me.

3077
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:20,280
Oh no, it's just me.

3078
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:21,880
Oh no, it's me and Marmorin.

3079
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:23,460
What do I do?

3080
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:24,400
I'm so scared.

3081
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:26,460
He doesn't have bullets.

3082
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:27,760
He doesn't have bullets.

3083
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:31,420
He doesn't have bullets, I know he doesn't have bullets.

3084
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,300
I know he doesn't.

3085
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:35,740
Oh my god, there he is.

3086
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:37,860
Oh my god, they're all spinning.

3087
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:39,280
They're all spinning.

3088
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:40,540
Oh, I don't have bullets either!

3089
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:42,200
I don't have bullets either!

3090
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:47,800
Oh my god.

3091
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:48,580
Oh my god, they're just...

3092
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:55,200
Oh shit, oh shit, we gotta get on point.

3093
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:56,000
No!

3094
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:06,700
Protect me!

3095
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:07,680
Get near me!

3096
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:08,480
Get near

3097
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:20,970
me!

3098
02:00:21,470 --> 02:00:23,130
You've never played CS...

3099
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:25,010
How are you B-hopping?

3100
02:00:25,550 --> 02:00:30,880
How are you B-hopping?

3101
02:00:31,670 --> 02:00:33,250
I don't understand.

3102
02:00:34,090 --> 02:00:37,190
How are you able to do it without...

3103
02:00:37,190 --> 02:00:39,430
To be dropped away.

3104
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:41,430
It's not easy!

3105
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:42,950
I don't understand.

3106
02:00:43,950 --> 02:00:45,270
That was so close.

3107
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:48,910
We were at 92 to 90 and they...

3108
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:52,450
Okay, the one-shot one is fun.

3109
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:54,530
I think the one-shot one is really fun.

3110
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:57,190
Alright, let's do the...

3111
02:00:57,910 --> 02:00:58,510
Let's do...

3112
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:00,010
Okay, when they started...

3113
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:01,110
That was really funny.

3114
02:01:01,230 --> 02:01:05,090
When they started just spinning was pretty funny.

3115
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:06,910
Okay.

3116
02:01:07,290 --> 02:01:07,890
Okay.

3117
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:10,690
Okay.

3118
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:12,990
Do we do capture?

3119
02:01:13,230 --> 02:01:14,990
Let's do team deathmatch for legit.

3120
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:16,250
We'll do legit now.

3121
02:01:19,530 --> 02:01:21,050
We'll do legit.

3122
02:01:25,670 --> 02:01:27,830
How dare you call me a deadweight!

3123
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:29,850
I played very well.

3124
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:31,170
Okay, I...

3125
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:34,930
I played pretty well for someone that never played CS, guys.

3126
02:01:35,190 --> 02:01:36,570
I think I did really well.

3127
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:42,250
Also, let me fix the fact that my aimpod keeps turning on and off.

3128
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:44,050
Let me fix that.

3129
02:01:45,470 --> 02:01:46,390
Real quick.

3130
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:47,230
Okay, there we go.

3131
02:01:48,930 --> 02:01:49,990
There we go, I fixed it.

3132
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:53,390
I was too lazy, but now I'm not lazy anymore.

3133
02:01:53,570 --> 02:01:54,250
Alright, here we go.

3134
02:01:54,290 --> 02:01:56,770
We'll do legit team deathmatch.

3135
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:57,370
Random.

3136
02:01:59,170 --> 02:02:00,950
I got distracted by all the...

3137
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:02,110
all the spins.

3138
02:02:03,150 --> 02:02:05,070
All the spinning was a little distracting.

3139
02:02:05,070 --> 02:02:06,050
Yeah, okay.

3140
02:02:06,510 --> 02:02:09,870
Because it's legit, I don't need to be a first person for this.

3141
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:12,910
Alright.

3142
02:02:15,070 --> 02:02:16,790
It's real aimpod time.

3143
02:02:18,450 --> 02:02:19,670
Oh, it's over.

3144
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,530
I have mamarin.

3145
02:02:20,910 --> 02:02:21,930
It's fucking over.

3146
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:25,710
It's fucking over.

3147
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:27,450
I have a real gamer now.

3148
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:29,490
That's fucking right.

3149
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,160
That's fucking right.

3150
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:35,620
That's right.

3151
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,440
Burn, yeah, that's right, burn!

3152
02:02:42,730 --> 02:02:44,770
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

3153
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:46,750
He's coming, oh no, he's coming.

3154
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:48,470
Guys, shake him, shake him before...

3155
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,670
Yeah!

3156
02:02:51,170 --> 02:02:52,050
That's a...

3157
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:53,630
Bodyguards.

3158
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:54,810
That's right.

3159
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:00,990
That's right.

3160
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:03,610
I don't have a bullet.

3161
02:03:07,070 --> 02:03:07,730
Thank this person.

3162
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:09,970
Where did he go?

3163
02:03:10,230 --> 02:03:12,550
Guys, I need that kill, guys, I need that kill.

3164
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:13,590
I don't have...

3165
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:13,970
No!

3166
02:03:15,790 --> 02:03:17,490
I don't have a bullet!

3167
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:24,220
Okay, that's fine.

3168
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:26,020
Oh, he's gonna carry us.

3169
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,640
Oh my god, what the fuck?

3170
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:31,280
Where was the angle?

3171
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:33,900
Guys, it's okay.

3172
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:38,520
It's okay, they're using util, which is obviously hacking.

3173
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:40,300
What the fuck is he doing?

3174
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:44,420
I can't believe it.

3175
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:47,280
You're a real gamer.

3176
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:49,680
No!

3177
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,920
I was doing so well!

3178
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:59,620
Guys, I'm still doing really well.

3179
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:02,200
Drive by Shaq.

3180
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:03,580
That's crazy.

3181
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:08,320
Oh no, that was my kill.

3182
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:10,700
No, oh you missed.

3183
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:12,540
You missed, buddy, you missed.

3184
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:14,640
No, I missed!

3185
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:19,630
God damn it, Cody!

3186
02:04:21,490 --> 02:04:23,810
How the fuck do you miss?

3187
02:04:24,810 --> 02:04:25,790
Oh fuck.

3188
02:04:26,570 --> 02:04:27,950
Oh fuck, okay.

3189
02:04:28,370 --> 02:04:30,010
No, I need this bullet, guys, I need...

3190
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:31,470
No, I need the bullet more!

3191
02:04:33,210 --> 02:04:33,730
Okay.

3192
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:40,100
I pretend I was shooting.

3193
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,560
Guys, guys, there's two...

3194
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:42,940
Okay.

3195
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:45,560
Guys, do you think...

3196
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,780
He's so good at shaking!

3197
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,060
I don't understand!

3198
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:00,640
Has Cody traveled to London?

3199
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:03,200
Oh my god.

3200
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:06,180
Get him, get him, get him.

3201
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:09,720
Oh no.

3202
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:13,960
Oh, I need...

3203
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:15,800
He doesn't have a gun, he doesn't have a gun.

3204
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:17,260
He doesn't have a gun.

3205
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:23,560
I swear, he's

3206
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:29,980
fucking shaking.

3207
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:31,080
I don't understand.

3208
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:34,420
I just meant to shake.

3209
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:37,360
No!

3210
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,100
Okay, it wasn't Cody.

3211
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:43,080
Wait, do I have right click?

3212
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:45,330
Oh my god.

3213
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,310
I didn't realize I didn't realize there was a right click.

3214
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:51,650
I'm fast now.

3215
02:05:52,110 --> 02:05:54,170
Wait, I think I bhop this time for real.

3216
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:56,090
Does this look like I'm bhopping, guys?

3217
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:04,660
Does this look like I'm bhopping, guys?

3218
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:06,580
Guys.

3219
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:09,500
No, no!

3220
02:06:12,850 --> 02:06:13,290
Wait.

3221
02:06:23,230 --> 02:06:24,510
There we go.

3222
02:06:25,950 --> 02:06:27,010
Wait, I still have one more bullet.

3223
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:29,550
I still have one more.

3224
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:35,330
Guys, does this look like I'm bhopping?

3225
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:43,750
Wait, look.

3226
02:06:44,110 --> 02:06:47,050
Look, why is knife when I can shoot?

3227
02:06:47,990 --> 02:06:51,590
Why is knife when I can...

3228
02:06:51,590 --> 02:06:52,610
Oh,

3229
02:06:56,230 --> 02:06:57,150
god damn it!

3230
02:06:58,990 --> 02:06:59,710
Get at this!

3231
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:02,930
Cody, I'm gonna fucking get you!

3232
02:07:03,470 --> 02:07:05,130
Ah, Cody, you little whore!

3233
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:07,070
You're such a whore!

3234
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:14,700
I can't!

3235
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,060
I can't!

3236
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:23,900
Guys, leave Cody for me!

3237
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:25,700
Leave him for me, guys!

3238
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:26,580
Don't get Cody!

3239
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:28,040
He's mine!

3240
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:28,620
No!

3241
02:07:31,890 --> 02:07:34,210
It was my kill!

3242
02:07:35,790 --> 02:07:36,350
No!

3243
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:38,550
Sorry, my kill.

3244
02:07:38,710 --> 02:07:39,690
I'll take this one.

3245
02:07:40,350 --> 02:07:49,230
It was supposed to be my kill!

3246
02:07:49,230 --> 02:07:51,690
He didn't earn it!

3247
02:07:51,910 --> 02:07:53,170
Yes, I did!

3248
02:07:53,630 --> 02:07:55,730
I did, it was mine!

3249
02:07:56,010 --> 02:07:57,450
I did earn it!

3250
02:07:58,230 --> 02:07:58,750
Alright.

3251
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:03,670
I think Rage one-shot is definitely more fun.

3252
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:04,490
For sure.

3253
02:08:04,890 --> 02:08:05,490
What do we do?

3254
02:08:05,570 --> 02:08:08,010
We did legit kill confirmed, right?

3255
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:10,830
Alright, what should we do?

3256
02:08:11,010 --> 02:08:14,030
I think King of... Oh, let's do Capture the Flag one-shot.

3257
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:16,850
Yeah, Capture the Flag one-shot.

3258
02:08:18,510 --> 02:08:18,990
Alright.

3259
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:21,730
Capture the Flag one-shot.

3260
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:22,610
This would be my...

3261
02:08:22,610 --> 02:08:23,510
This is my LG.

3262
02:08:24,350 --> 02:08:25,430
This is my LG.

3263
02:08:26,110 --> 02:08:27,330
Wait, Cody's out?

3264
02:08:27,490 --> 02:08:28,690
Oh, Cody's out, but yeah.

3265
02:08:30,330 --> 02:08:32,310
This is my LG here.

3266
02:08:37,090 --> 02:08:37,570
Alright.

3267
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:41,450
I don't think Capture the Flag one-shot is much more fun.

3268
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:44,430
I think the one-shot mode is definitely a lot more fun.

3269
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,400
Okay.

3270
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,580
Well, actually, no.

3271
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:52,380
This is not LG.

3272
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:53,540
I'll make one last lap.

3273
02:08:53,540 --> 02:08:54,120
No!

3274
02:08:57,240 --> 02:09:00,080
Wait, they have Marmorant and F2P!

3275
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:01,020
Guys, we're fucked.

3276
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:01,900
Guys.

3277
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:03,580
Guys, we're not... Guys.

3278
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:06,760
Guys, they have Marmorant and F2P.

3279
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:07,240
Guys.

3280
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:09,680
Guys, they have the Barbie Hoppers.

3281
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:13,740
They have... They have the Barbie Hoppers.

3282
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:14,560
Guys.

3283
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:16,200
Guys, we're...

3284
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:17,480
It's not fair!

3285
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:17,560
It's not fair!

3286
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:28,310
They have people who can B-hop!

3287
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:29,870
We can't!

3288
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:32,390
Guys!

3289
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:34,870
Guys, he's just hopping away!

3290
02:09:35,530 --> 02:09:37,690
He's just hopping away!

3291
02:09:38,210 --> 02:09:42,010
What the fuck do we... He's just...

3292
02:09:42,010 --> 02:09:44,110
He's just hopping away.

3293
02:09:45,730 --> 02:09:47,670
Bro, he's just...

3294
02:09:48,630 --> 02:09:50,510
Oh my god!

3295
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:55,430
No!

3296
02:09:56,290 --> 02:09:57,670
He's just hopping!

3297
02:09:58,030 --> 02:09:59,510
How did we get him?

3298
02:10:01,090 --> 02:10:02,590
I forgot I was aimbotting.

3299
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:07,930
Oh my god!

3300
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:09,710
And he went away.

3301
02:10:10,490 --> 02:10:12,770
And he went away.

3302
02:10:13,290 --> 02:10:14,150
Boom, boom, boom.

3303
02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:16,550
Oh my god, it's not fair!

3304
02:10:17,010 --> 02:10:19,110
He's just jumping.

3305
02:10:19,530 --> 02:10:21,950
He's just jumping so fast!

3306
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:23,970
Like, what do we do?

3307
02:10:27,950 --> 02:10:30,290
This is like...

3308
02:10:30,290 --> 02:10:33,710
Like, he's jumping!

3309
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:37,210
They have two B-hoppers?

3310
02:10:37,510 --> 02:10:38,610
What do we do?

3311
02:10:38,950 --> 02:10:40,070
He's just jumping!

3312
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:45,710
What do we do?

3313
02:10:46,210 --> 02:10:47,430
He's just jumping!

3314
02:10:50,990 --> 02:10:52,390
Oh my god!

3315
02:10:52,390 --> 02:10:55,670
Oh my god, bro, he's jumping again!

3316
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:57,270
What the fuck?

3317
02:10:58,830 --> 02:10:59,690
He's just...

3318
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:01,910
He's just jumping away!

3319
02:11:02,350 --> 02:11:03,870
What do we do?

3320
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:06,510
I don't know, what the fuck do we do?

3321
02:11:06,970 --> 02:11:08,930
Oh my god, guys, help me!

3322
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:10,030
Guys!

3323
02:11:10,530 --> 02:11:11,730
Guys, help me!

3324
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:13,950
Oh my god, we got a boy!

3325
02:11:14,190 --> 02:11:16,590
Guys, I'm so proud of us!

3326
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:18,690
I'm so proud of us!

3327
02:11:18,690 --> 02:11:21,830
We got a boy, everybody!

3328
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:23,750
We did it!

3329
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:25,410
We got one!

3330
02:11:26,170 --> 02:11:29,270
Please don't be disappointed in me!

3331
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:34,870
Please don't be disappointed, I know!

3332
02:11:35,270 --> 02:11:37,930
I know, he's just hopping away!

3333
02:11:38,310 --> 02:11:40,730
I don't know what to do, Jokey!

3334
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:44,750
I don't know what to do, he's just hopping!

3335
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:48,270

Stop shaving me!

3337
02:11:52,350 --> 02:11:55,590
He's shaving me!

3338
02:11:57,590 --> 02:12:05,650
Oh my god, he's just shaving me!

3339
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:09,150
I can't believe it!

3340
02:12:09,150 --> 02:12:11,530
Please have mercy!

3341
02:12:15,330 --> 02:12:17,630
It's not fair!

3342
02:12:18,170 --> 02:12:20,430
It's not fair!

3343
02:12:20,710 --> 02:12:21,670
Look at him!

3344
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:22,770
Look at him!

3345
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:25,250
Oh my god!

3346
02:12:26,370 --> 02:12:30,630
Oh my god, I finally got one of the bee hoppers, guys!

3347
02:12:30,810 --> 02:12:32,170
The world is safe now!

3348
02:12:32,670 --> 02:12:33,750
Do not worry!

3349
02:12:34,330 --> 02:12:36,150
The world is now safe!

3350
02:12:36,150 --> 02:12:37,750
Oh my god, worry!

3351
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:38,890
Worry!

3352
02:12:40,410 --> 02:12:41,050
Worry!

3353
02:12:41,250 --> 02:12:42,350
Oh my god!

3354
02:12:42,450 --> 02:12:42,750
Worry!

3355
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:47,650
Guys, if you...

3356
02:12:47,650 --> 02:12:51,090
How do I... Guys, how do I win this?

3357
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:52,890
Guys, look at them!

3358
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:55,630
They're just...

3359
02:12:56,150 --> 02:12:57,530
Just let them take it!

3360
02:12:57,910 --> 02:12:59,830
End this misery!

3361
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:01,570
Just let them take it, guys!

3362
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:07,510
Just let them come in, and bee hop away, and take the flag, and then bee hop away!

3363
02:13:11,970 --> 02:13:13,130
Not sure...

3364
02:13:14,050 --> 02:13:16,550
You don't win, you survive!

3365
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:21,010
Guys, form a circle around me, guys!

3366
02:13:21,510 --> 02:13:22,930
We know we lost, guys!

3367
02:13:23,490 --> 02:13:27,550
Just form a circle around me, protect me!

3368
02:13:27,790 --> 02:13:29,850
Protect me in this corner, guys!

3369
02:13:30,410 --> 02:13:32,350
Protect me before it's too late!

3370
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:34,730
Guys, protect me in this corner!

3371
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:36,470
Guys, get over here!

3372
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:38,510
Get over here, protect me!

3373
02:13:40,690 --> 02:13:43,210
Get over here, protect me!

3374
02:13:43,630 --> 02:13:46,850
And we all bunched up together, they don't know which one's me!

3375
02:13:49,090 --> 02:13:51,450
They won't know which one's me!

3376
02:13:51,970 --> 02:13:54,030
And we all bunched up together!

3377
02:13:54,470 --> 02:13:56,430
Which one's the real dookie?

3378
02:13:56,770 --> 02:13:58,130
They won't know!

3379
02:13:58,410 --> 02:13:59,530
That's right!

3380
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:04,830
Yay, I survived!

3381
02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:06,690
They couldn't tell!

3382
02:14:07,390 --> 02:14:08,190
I survived!

3383
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:14,870
Okay, we'll do one last, we'll make a new lobby and do one last game, guys.

3384
02:14:15,310 --> 02:14:18,250
We'll make a new lobby and I'll do one last game.

3385
02:14:19,790 --> 02:14:21,310
Dad knows!

3386
02:14:21,850 --> 02:14:23,210
It worked!

3387
02:14:23,370 --> 02:14:25,330
It worked, everyone!

3388
02:14:26,710 --> 02:14:28,230
Aw, jeez!

3389
02:14:29,430 --> 02:14:31,670
Alright, I think he's hungry.

3390
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:33,150
I'll go get him food, too.

3391
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:33,850
I'll be right back.

3392
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:01,850
Yeah, he was hungry.

3393
02:15:02,470 --> 02:15:03,990
He was like, food time!

3394
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:10,290
And then the moment I put food on the on the tree, he's like, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

3395
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:13,010
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

3396
02:15:14,410 --> 02:15:15,790
He's a hungry boy.

3397
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:19,070
He's a hungry boy.

3398
02:15:19,470 --> 02:15:21,130
Alright, LG, guys!

3399
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:22,690
LG!

3400
02:15:22,690 --> 02:15:23,010
LG!

3401
02:15:24,130 --> 02:15:25,690
Alright, we're gonna go all in.

3402
02:15:26,030 --> 02:15:28,150
All the cheats, everybody.

3403
02:15:28,450 --> 02:15:29,410
Okay, Rage.

3404
02:15:30,030 --> 02:15:31,390
Alright, no one shot.

3405
02:15:31,570 --> 02:15:33,670
Alright, what do we want for all cheats, guys?

3406
02:15:33,910 --> 02:15:35,150
Team Deathmatch capture.

3407
02:15:37,610 --> 02:15:38,410
Let's do...

3408
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:39,490
What do we want?

3409
02:15:41,210 --> 02:15:42,130
King of the Hill?

3410
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:43,810
I think King of the Hill was really fun.

3411
02:15:45,930 --> 02:15:47,750
Um, King of the Hill, kill confirm.

3412
02:15:47,850 --> 02:15:49,250
Actually, you guys, what do you guys want?

3413
02:15:50,630 --> 02:15:51,870
What do we do?

3414
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:53,450
Team Death?

3415
02:15:53,690 --> 02:15:55,190
Team Deathmatch capture the flag.

3416
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:58,410
Flag, kill, confirmed.

3417
02:15:58,530 --> 02:15:59,270
Sniper only.

3418
02:16:02,270 --> 02:16:03,270
Which one?

3419
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:06,250
We are not doing raid boss, guys.

3420
02:16:08,670 --> 02:16:09,850
Kill confirmed.

3421
02:16:11,950 --> 02:16:13,090
Capture the flag.

3422
02:16:13,310 --> 02:16:14,050
What did I say?

3423
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:17,090
Capture the flag.

3424
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:24,860
One shot is so fun.

3425
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:26,760
Yeah, but I wanna do all cheats.

3426
02:16:36,050 --> 02:16:37,010
King of the Hill?

3427
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:38,410
Okay, King of the Hill.

02:16:40,310 --> 02:16:41,810
Alright, King of the Hill.

02:16:48,650 --> 02:16:49,090
Alright.

3431
02:16:52,430 --> 02:16:53,310
Let's go.

3432
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:06,340
Alright, here we go.

3433
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:07,460
Oh my god, do I...

3434
02:17:07,460 --> 02:17:08,220
Oh, we do.

3435
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:10,700
Guys, we have one of the CS players.

3436
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:15,020
I'm so scared.

3437
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:19,880
I'm so scared.

3438
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:22,220
I'm so scared.

3439
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:26,580
Oh my god.

3440
02:17:26,940 --> 02:17:30,260
Why is everybody so good at aimbot?

3441
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:35,160
Guys, we gotta get to the King of the Hill.

3442
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:36,340
No!

3443
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:37,960
Wait, I know what to do.

3444
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:39,140
It's time.

3445
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:42,980
Maximum spin.

3446
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:45,820
Okay, maybe not.

3447
02:17:51,670 --> 02:17:53,330
Guys, it's time.

3448
02:17:55,490 --> 02:17:56,710
Maximum spin.

3449
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:01,820
Oh my god.

3450
02:18:02,300 --> 02:18:03,560
Guys, we gotta...

3451
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:05,520
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

3452
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:08,280
Guys, what do I...

3453
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:10,380
Guys, if I keep...

3454
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:13,940
Guys, if I never stop shooting, we'll kill them all.

3455
02:18:13,940 --> 02:18:15,640
If I...

3456
02:18:18,140 --> 02:18:23,840
Guys, if we never stop shooting, we'll kill... Oh, this is a lot harder.

3457
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:25,100
Wait, guys.

3458
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:27,400
Guys, this is a lot harder.

3459
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:28,540
I don't know.

3460
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:30,760
I stood in the open and it worked somehow.

3461
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:36,060
Oh my god, it's working, guys.

3462
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:37,940
Just stand in the open, guys.

3463
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,560
It works.

3464
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:41,140
Guys, the no cover thing is actually really hard.

3465
02:18:41,140 --> 02:18:43,180
Guys, the no cover...

3466
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:44,760
There's no cover!

3467
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:46,400
What do we do?

3468
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:47,680
There's no cover!

3469
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:49,320
It's time, guys.

3470
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:52,040
It gets freaking obliterated instantly.

3471
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:55,400
Thank you for the super chat.

3472
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:55,900
Thank you.

3473
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:59,060
Oh my... That's it.

3474
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:01,300
That's it.

3475
02:19:07,430 --> 02:19:08,950
Guys, that's it.

3476
02:19:11,790 --> 02:19:12,350
That's it.

3477
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:14,110
He has to peek eventually, right?

3478
02:19:15,230 --> 02:19:17,070
Guys, we have to be on the point, guys.

3479
02:19:17,550 --> 02:19:19,990
We can't win if we're not on the point.

3480
02:19:22,850 --> 02:19:23,410
Guys.

3481
02:19:25,070 --> 02:19:25,910
Going in.

3482
02:19:25,990 --> 02:19:26,210
No!

3483
02:19:29,390 --> 02:19:31,470
Okay, hopping is not it.

3484
02:19:31,890 --> 02:19:34,170
Hopping is actually not it.

3485
02:19:35,390 --> 02:19:38,650
Oh my god, there's so many There's so many.

3486
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:42,930
Why is everybody so good at cheating?

3487
02:19:43,210 --> 02:19:44,050
I don't understand!

3488
02:19:46,510 --> 02:19:47,790
Guys, just stand in the open.

3489
02:19:47,950 --> 02:19:48,890
It works, trust me.

3490
02:19:49,970 --> 02:19:51,090
Trust me, it works.

3491
02:19:51,230 --> 02:19:53,130
It actually... Oh my god.

3492
02:19:54,770 --> 02:19:58,650
Guys, if we all run at the point together, we can't kill us all.

3493
02:19:59,530 --> 02:20:00,710
Oh my god.

3494
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:02,790
Guys, guys.

3495
02:20:02,890 --> 02:20:03,750
Let's all stay in spawn.

3496
02:20:03,870 --> 02:20:04,710
Stay in spawn, guys.

3497
02:20:04,710 --> 02:20:06,010
Stay in spawn, then we all run in.

3498
02:20:06,090 --> 02:20:08,450
Guys, let's all 3... 2... 1... Go!

3499
02:20:08,590 --> 02:20:08,790
Go!

3500

I got it.

3507
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:19,430
I know what to do.

3508
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:23,510
I...

3509
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:26,630
Guys, I know what to do.

02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:29,510
You too.

3511
02:20:30,890 --> 02:20:31,470
That's right.

3512
02:20:31,510 --> 02:20:33,330
What you gonna do now, bitch?

3513
02:20:36,070 --> 02:20:36,610
That's right.

3514
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:37,430
You too.

3515
02:20:37,650 --> 02:20:38,670
Oh my gosh, my you too.

3516
02:20:39,790 --> 02:20:40,730
That's accurate.

3517
02:20:40,990 --> 02:20:42,210
What you gonna do now?

3518
02:20:42,330 --> 02:20:43,330
I have you too.

3519
02:20:46,670 --> 02:20:47,470
Oh no.

3520
02:20:47,610 --> 02:20:48,810
Oh no, I have to reload.

3521
02:20:52,230 --> 02:20:53,250
Watch this.

3522
02:20:53,750 --> 02:20:54,210
You too.

3523
02:20:59,070 --> 02:21:00,250
Oh my god.

3524
02:21:00,730 --> 02:21:03,650
Why is everyone so good at

3525
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:10,340
fighting?

3526
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:12,860
It should be even.

3527
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:16,700
Everyone, please.

3528
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:20,320
Please, I can't even leave spawn.

3529
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:25,940
Okay, I figured it out.

3530
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:28,540
There we go.

3531
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:30,540
There we go.

3532
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:32,300
I figured it out.

3533
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:36,460
No!

3534
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:37,620
Guys!

3535
02:21:37,980 --> 02:21:39,080
Guys, get on the point.

3536
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,100
I'm camping them.

3537
02:21:44,260 --> 02:21:44,580
Okay.

3538
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:46,020
Okay, we got this.

3539
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:49,560
There we go.

3540
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:51,680
That should head somewhere, right?

3541
02:21:52,060 --> 02:21:52,600
Oh no.

3542
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:53,380
Oh no.

3543
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:54,400
Oh no.

3544
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:56,780
Nice, I got one.

3545
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:58,220
I got one.

3546
02:21:58,760 --> 02:21:59,920
Guys, I figured it out.

3547
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:02,580
The power of you too.

3548
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:04,780
Oh my god.

3549
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:05,800
Oh my god.

3550
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:06,840
They're throwing...

3551
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:10,020
No, I'm dead.

3552
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:11,600
Guys, guys.

3553
02:22:12,340 --> 02:22:13,260
Guys, surround me.

3554
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:14,260
Get in the corner, guys.

3555
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:16,340
Guys, get in the corner.

3556
02:22:16,340 --> 02:22:16,840
Get in.

3557
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:17,560
Get in.

3558
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:18,480
No, get in.

3559
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:19,440
No!

3560
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:21,120
Oh my god.

3561
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:22,260
No!

3562
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:24,280
Oh, thank god.

3563
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:26,080
Spare me of my misery.

3564
02:22:29,140 --> 02:22:31,120
It's not my fault.

3565
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:33,560
It's not my fault.

3566
02:22:33,740 --> 02:22:35,960
This map fucking sucks.

3567
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:37,380
I can't deal.

3568
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:40,740
It's not my fault.

3569
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:43,220
It's not my fault.

3570
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:45,460
Chat, I swear to god.

3571
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:49,260
It's not my fault.

3572
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:52,680
It's a team game.

3573
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:54,060
It's...

3574
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:55,640
They use util.

3575
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:56,860
They're cheaters.

3576
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:00,240
Why the fuck would they use util?

3577
02:23:01,300 --> 02:23:03,380
I can't believe it.

3578
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:05,600
They use utilities.

3579
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:08,900
I picked random.

3580
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:08,920
Random?

3581
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:11,400
Are you allowed?

3582
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:18,320
This is all Clara's fault.

3583
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:22,000
This is all Clara's fault.

3584
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:24,760
Why would you?

3585
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:30,620
If we all aim bot, there should have been nothing else.

3586
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:32,440
Blaming the team.

3587
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:35,000
Classic CSGO mindset.

3588
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:40,440
But yeah, that was fun.

3589
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:42,040
That was really fun.

3590
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:44,960
Thank you to the devs for sending me free game codes.

3591
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:46,420
Maddie, thank you for the super chat.

3592
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:46,840
GG.

3593
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:47,420
Easy.

3594
02:23:48,140 --> 02:23:49,020
Fuck you.

3595
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:50,580
For using util.

3596
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:56,560
That's right.

3597
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:58,160
And cheaters cheat.

3598
02:23:58,680 --> 02:23:59,880
If you...

3599
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:01,660
Aim botting is not the cheating.

3600
02:24:02,220 --> 02:24:03,360
It's the bhop.

3601
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:04,320
The fucking...

3602
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:06,240
The fucking...

3603
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:09,020
That one guy...

3604
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:10,200
Fucking bhop.

3605
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:12,140
All the way to the flag.

3606
02:24:12,320 --> 02:24:14,460
And we had to chase him down.

3607
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:17,560
How the fuck do you chase that down?

3608
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,120
Holy shit.

3609
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:21,560
That was fucking crazy.

3610
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:25,360
And then he brought out his...

3611
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:26,560
Fucking minigun.

3612
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,760
After he gets the flag.

3613
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:30,760
And I was like, what do we do?

3614
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:36,480
But thank you.

3615
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:38,680
Thank you all for coming today, guys.

3616
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:40,240
Zekka, thank you for the super chat.

3617
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:40,540
Thank you.

3618
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:42,720
I'll not be able to play this game.

3619
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:44,840
I'll be laughing myself to death with how chaotic it is.

3620
02:24:45,020 --> 02:24:46,360
Especially with the spitting.

3621
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:48,220
Thank you for the super chat.

3622
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:48,800
Thank you.

3623
02:24:49,540 --> 02:24:53,100
And then when the team had two bhoppers.

3624
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:55,720
And you're just like, well, I guess we lose.

3625
02:24:57,300 --> 02:24:59,620
I just see one of them get the flag.

3626
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:00,460
And he's gone.

3627
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:03,560
He gets the flag for one second.

3628
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:06,440
And then he's on the other side of the fucking map.

3629
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:07,920
And I'm like, alright.

3630
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:09,820
I guess we lose.

3631
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:17,760
I guess we fucking lose now.

3632
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,280
That's really fun though.

3633
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:25,460
I had a great time.

3634
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:26,620
I had a great time playing.

3635
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:27,640
I hope you guys...

3636
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:29,480
I don't know how to bhop!

3637
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:31,560
I don't know how to CSGO bhop.

3638
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:33,200
I know how to Apex bhop.

3639
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:35,280
Apex bhop is so different.

3640
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:38,640
Apex bhopping is for babies.

3641
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:40,060
And I'm like...

3642
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:41,960
I don't know how.

3643
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:43,640
How do they do it?

3644
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:44,940
How the fuck?

3645
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:48,220
I don't know how to Apex bhop.

3646
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:50,380
I don't know how to CS bhop.

3647
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:52,820
Like, how do they do it?

3648
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:54,200
What?

3649
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:55,040
Oh my god.

3650
02:25:55,840 --> 02:26:00,140
I've never tactical shooter bhop before.

3651
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:03,480
What?

3652
02:26:06,590 --> 02:26:07,040
What?

3653
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:10,140
It's holding the side?

3654
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:11,080
How?

3655
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:13,800
You don't press W?

3656
02:26:14,060 --> 02:26:14,480
What?

3657
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:19,840
How do you move forward if you don't press W?

3658
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:22,360
I don't understand.

3659
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:26,360
How do you move forward if you don't press W?

3660
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:31,680
Film with momentum?

3661
02:26:34,460 --> 02:26:34,980
What?

3662
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:37,580
I'll never know.

3663
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:39,320
I'll never know.

3664
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:40,800
F2P, how does he do it?

3665
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:41,340
Show us.

3666
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:43,560
Show us your B- What the fuck?

3667
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:44,520
Look at him go!

3668
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:45,760
Look at them go!

3669
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:47,220
He's an actual cheetah!

3670
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:49,140
Oh my god!

3671
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:51,540
Alright, Mama Rin, show your B-hop.

3672
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:53,000
Show us your B-hop.

3673
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:54,320
Oh my god!

3674
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:55,520
Look at them go!

3675
02:26:58,120 --> 02:26:59,460
Fucking B-hop!

3676
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:04,880
He's so- oh my god!

3677
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:06,760
He's so fast!

3678
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,320
I don't understand!

3679
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:10,460
Oh my god!

3680
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:12,300
I don't understand!

3681
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:14,700
I just lose momentum after!

3682
02:27:15,180 --> 02:27:17,140
What the fuck do I want to B-hop?

3683
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:19,060
I don't- oh!

3684
02:27:19,460 --> 02:27:20,440
Too quick!

3685
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:23,520
The actual game, look at them all B-hopping!

3686
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:26,060
Oh my god, I can't!

3687
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:27,480
I don't get it!

3688
02:27:27,860 --> 02:27:29,680
This is the best I can do!

3689
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:33,060
This is- this is the best I can do, guys!

3690
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:35,900
Look at- oh my god, it's so fast!

3691
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:42,420
It's- He's- he's a real cheetah!

3692
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:44,980
They're styling on everyone!

3693
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:46,220
Oh!

3694
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:49,360
That's the best I could do, chat.

3695
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:53,420
That's the- that's the best I could do, guys.

3696
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:55,620
Oh my god!

3697
02:27:56,220 --> 02:27:56,660
Oh!

3698
02:27:57,180 --> 02:27:57,860
Anyway, guys.

3699
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,360
That was really fun, though.

3700
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:04,140
I'm glad I got to try out Cheetah's- Cheetah- Cheater's Cheetah.

3701
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:06,300
Johnny Lacone, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3702
02:28:06,300 --> 02:28:09,580
You know you play Quake 3 Arena with us, you'll learn in no time.

3703
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:12,420
I'm just gonna get absolutely destroyed in Quake.

3704
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:15,120
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3705
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:17,540
You know you can B-hop in Marvel Rivals?

3706
02:28:17,540 --> 02:28:20,880
I didn't even realize Marvel Rivals has that mechanic.

3707
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:24,300
Apparently, if you play like DPS characters, you can B-hop.

3708
02:28:24,820 --> 02:28:27,040
Um, for some of the DPS characters.

3709
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:28,700
I'm like, what the fuck?

3710
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:31,920
Like, I didn't even realize that.

3711
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:34,160
Um, you B-hop everywhere.

3712
02:28:34,660 --> 02:28:36,320
Uh, even on Mantis?

3713
02:28:36,380 --> 02:28:37,340
Oh my god.

3714
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:41,600
I'm fucking using my legs regularly like a fucking caveman.

3715
02:28:41,980 --> 02:28:46,920
Like- Thank you everybody for watching.

3716
02:28:47,380 --> 02:28:49,960

As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

3720
02:28:58,920 --> 02:29:02,660
I wish I could do like, you know, after a game Zatsudan.

3721
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:08,720
But like, um, I'm trying not to like fuck up my voice too much.

3722
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:11,780
Like, I'm trying to rest as much as I can in between streams.

3723
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:12,720
So I do recover.

3724
02:29:12,980 --> 02:29:18,040
By the time- When my voice is fully recovered, we'll have more after game chatting.

3725
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:20,280
We'll have like, after game chatting again.

3726
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:24,500
But for now, uh, I don't wanna overdo it.

3727
02:29:24,580 --> 02:29:26,240
So thank you everybody for coming, everyone.

3728
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:29,100
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

Posture check.

3730
02:29:30,580 --> 02:29:32,840
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3731
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,520
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

3732
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:37,240
Cause you deserve it.

3733
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:39,340
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3734
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:42,420
I'm sorry for my mush mouth there.

3735
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:45,220
I was like- I was like, wait, what did I say?

3736
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:50,440
I was like, oh my god, my flag, my mushy mouth and accent.

3737
02:29:51,340 --> 02:29:53,400
It's okay, I meant the cigarette, guys.
