1
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,570
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,550
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,450
I will give you guys a warning.

4
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:13,470
I am lower energy today than usual, because maybe my energy will pick up later on, but it's because today I was reminded that I am a woman.

5
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,280
So, no, it wasn't anything that dad did.

6
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,800
Um, I knew.

7
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,560
Um, okay.

8
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,060
So, no, it was actually today.

9
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,100
It was like last night.

10
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,420
I was, uh, uh, reminded that wowie!

11
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,160
My bro tuber is a woman!

12
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,420
Unsubscribe.

13
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,920
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

14
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,960
Thank you, thank you.

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,480
Welcome back, cheater.

16
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,240
Seijian, thank you for the super chat.

17
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,260
Thank you, thank you.

18
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,740
Um, uh, NSD, thank you for the five gifted ships.

19
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,800
Thank you, thank you.

20
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,700
My immersion!

21
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:08,560
I did not come here to- I did not come to this stream to find out you were a woman!

22
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,700
Bro, no way, bro.

23
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,460
How could this be, bro?

24
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,320
I feel so fucking portrayed.

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:29,640
Anyway, but yes, I knew it was going to be my No Girls Allowed Club ruined.

26
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,300
Bro, what about No Girls Allowed, bro?

27
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,500
That was the first rule we made together.

28
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:48,820
Anyway, so I knew it was going to be really bad because last night I went to bed at 10 p.m.

29
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,880
and I didn't come out of my coma until like 11 a.m.

30
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,540
So I knew this was a bad one.

31
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,780
This was going to be a bad day.

32
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,740
So, yeah, I went into a... and I woke up and I'm still tired.

33
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,680
I knew it was going to be a bad day.

34
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:16,700
Hey!

35
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,420
Patch... Patch... Patchesu, thank you for the super chat.

36
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:24,700
Thank you.

37
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,140
Thank you.

38
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,620
I got my crookie plushie.

39
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,040
Yippee!

40
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,300
Yeah, I heard a lot of people are getting a crookie plushie from YouTubes already.

41
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,520
So I... it was weird that they are shipping individually, but that's okay.

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,760
It means you don't have to pay for extra shipping, you know?

43
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,180
So at least that's good.

44
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,540
Uh, but yeah, a lot of people are slowly getting their plushies from YouTubes.

45
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,580
Uh, and they are a lot bigger than...

46
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,320
I know a lot of you guys were like, Wow, I did not expect them to be that big.

47
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,460
I warned you guys!

48
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,640
I was like, when I got those plushies, I was like, Oh my God!

49
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,300
They were a lot bigger than I...

50
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,060
But I also had that same reaction when I got those plushies.

51
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,500
Um, but I felt like, you know...

52
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,840
Good bar... like, good deal though.

53
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,800
It's a good deal for the amount, uh, for what it was...

54
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,740
For what it was priced for the final product.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,600
Like, the...

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,100
The size of the plushie compared to, like, what the price it was.

57
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,440
It was like, you know, a good deal.

58
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,220
A good bargain.

59
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,620
And I'll always be watching you.

60
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,460
I'll always be watching you now.

61
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,620
Um, uh, what a deal.

62
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,280
But yes, also for those who don't know.

63
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,740
Um, my very first podcast, uh, that I've ever done.

64
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,700
This, like, the very first time I've ever done a podcast.

65
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,040
Um, is now out on the Sweet and Sour channel.

66
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,740
That's usually hosted by Lily Pichu and Pokimane.

67
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,140
Um, but, uh, Poki wasn't there.

68
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,880
So they got me, Doki, to... as a guest.

69
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,260
Because she wasn't there that day.

70
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,640
So they're like, Doki, you wanna do a podcast with Lily Pichu?

71
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,640
And I was like, yeah, sure.

72
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,820
Uh, of course.

73
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,880
Um, uh, I'd love to.

74
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,580
Uh, so we revealed a special collaboration.

75
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,280
Um, that has been in works for a while.

76
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,740
So for those who wanna get spoiled right away as to what it is.

77
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,980
Um, because Lily...

78
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,580
Um, she literally started off the podcast, like, hounding me about this.

79
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,440
So I might as well reveal it.

80
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,760
So Lily, Lily Pichu and I are actually working on an original song together.

81
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:34,040
Um, the song was written, um, uh, the song was actually written a while ago.

82
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,800
Uh, but, like, um, a couple of months ago.

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,180
But, um, it was very, very unlucky.

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,200
Because I actually got very sick, um, multiple times throughout the year.

85
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,660
I think you guys might remember that.

86
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,580
So, like, I actually...

87
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,280
No, it's a different original song.

88
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,300
This one is more so, more so, more of Lily Pichu's style.

89
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,700
Have you ever listened to Lily's songs?

90
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,980
This is, like, her, uh, like, the more soft one.

91
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,080
The more softer tone songs.

92
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,940
And it's actually gonna be a collaboration with also the same producer who did Last Cup of Coffee.

93
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,440
Um, so, uh, we were working on this for a while now, I think.

94
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,500
I think, like, this was in the works for, like, around a year.

95
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,820
And, uh, um, I was supposed to record it a lot earlier.

96
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,940
Like, a lot, lot earlier.

97
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,540
But the reason why...

98
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,760
I still haven't recorded it yet.

99
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:43,440
But the reason why it took so long to actually get to the recording of this was because when she actually finished writing the song, I kept getting sick back to back to back.

100
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,100
Or had other obligations.

101
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:54,320
So, like, I think when she was done with the song, um, I got sick from the Phantom Thief concert.

102
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,660
And then when I got better, I got sick in Japan.

103
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,700
And then when I got better, my voice at my throat was, like, not okay.

104
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,600
So, I was waiting for that to recover.

105
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,820
And then after that, I had to prepare for...

106
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,760
I had to prepare for my birthday concert.

107
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,920
And now, it should be okay now.

108
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,780
So, I'm planning on trying to get that recorded.

109
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,200
Like, maybe this month or next month.

110
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,500
And then, finally, we can get started on the song.

111
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,860
But yes, it is a huge honor to work with Lily on this.

112
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,280
I asked her if she was available, if she wanted to do this with me.

113
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,560
And she's like, yeah, I'm so down.

114
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm really happy, excited to work on an original song with you.

115
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:54,000
And, uh, uh, I'm like, you know, I'm super excited to, uh, to finally sing it, to finally record it.

116
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,840
Uh, I hope it'll sound good.

117
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,260
When she sent me the demo, it sounded amazing.

118
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,140
But, of course, Lily is an amazing singer, an amazing songwriter.

119
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:09,360
Um, but, like, her songs are, I don't know, like, her songs are a little difficult to sing.

120
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,660
Because, um, they're quite high and very soft.

121
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,360
So, I hope I can do it justice.

122
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,100
And I'm very excited to record it.

123
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
I'm actually going to go to a recording studio for this one.

124
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,400
Because, you know, I want it to be a very good quality for her.

125
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,600
Uh, Valdemir, thank you for the super chat.

126
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,460
Thank you, thank you.

127
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,120
Really like the podcast, Doki.

128
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,060
Hope you take part of mine.

129
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,480
Thank you.

130
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,260
Thank you for the super chat.

131
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,820
Thank you, thank you.

132
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,520
Yes, I'm very, I was very happy to be a guest on her podcast.

133
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:45,220
Uh, Lily and I are planning on doing collab next week, uh, together to, you know, celebrate the podcast, um, and the, you know, the song collaboration.

134
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,780
Um, we haven't settled on a time yet.

135
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,240
She is a very busy person.

136
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,320
Um, you know, she has so many things that she does every day.

137
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:07,700
Uh, you know, when I was, like, doing that podcast with her, um, uh, she had, like, so much stuff in her schedule on her day and then she had, like, so many things lined up for it, uh, for, for, like, her day in general.

138
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,580
Um, I admire her.

139
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,340
I admire, like, like, how much work she does every day and, like, how she puts...

140
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:24,380
And then, like, right after the podcast recording, she, like, went straight to do that charity thing with Cutie Cinderella.

141
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,600
I don't know if you guys know about...

142
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:26,860
Oh, sorry.

143
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,760
My brain is, like, all over the place right now because I'm tired.

144
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,600
Uh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

145
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:42,680
But, um, it was, it was, the podcast was recorded on the same day where, uh, Cutie Cinderella was hosting the charity karaoke night thing.

146
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:54,640
So, like, right after recording the podcast, she had, like, a little interval intermission time and then she had to go straight to the, um, to the karaoke session, um, to, like, the, as a guest there, too.

147
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,520
So, I was, like, wow, like, your day is so fucking packed.

148
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:05,620
Like, um, um, like, um, I really admire her able to do so many things, especially going outside.

149
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

150
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,700
Essentially going outside as one of the tasks that you have to do for it.

151
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

152
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:21,160
But, uh, I really admire her, like, work ethic, uh, because she has been around the internet for so long, you know?

153
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:31,820
Able to still consistently being able to do, uh, these things and, like, making these types of content and stuff, um, uh, consistently for, like, what?

154
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
I don't remember how long she's been a content creator.

155
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,660
For like, maybe like 8 plus years now.

156
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:50,160
It has to be like, maybe even 10 plus... I don't know, like whenever she first posted her League of Legends songs, maybe like 10 plus years and still being such an active like content creator over the years is like quite inspiring.

157
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,320
So I had... it was such a huge honor to, you know, have this conversation with her.

158
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,000
And the hour passed by super fast too.

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,840
So like, I got really worried about like, oh man, what if we run out stuff to talk about?

160
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,780
What if we run out stuff to talk about?

161
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,620
What if like, oh, what if like, there's dead air and stuff like that?

162
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,760
Oh man, I got super duper worried.

163
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,120
But no, everything flowed naturally.

164
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:28,880
The only like hurdle we had was me trying to get Kroki to work because it's been so long since I brought Kroki out, that it's like a whole separate program.

165
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,120
So like, I honestly forgot like, I forgot like how to set it up.

166
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,340
So that's why I showed up like, I had like no, like no tracking whatsoever on there when I, when Kroki showed up.

167
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,740
And then Lily was like, wow, you like hyped it up so much.

168
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,120
This is a bit disappointing.

169
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,060
I was like, no, you don't understand.

170
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,620
You don't understand.

171
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,020
You don't understand.

172
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,300
It's so, it's so much better when it's moving.

173
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:02,020
And then like after, after like the, the recording ended, um, I sent her a, I actually got Kroki to work.

174
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,480
I got her to work because I like looked, I had to Google YouTube tutorial on how to set it up.

175
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,900
And then, yeah, I click baited her basically.

176
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,900
Um, cause she, she had such high expectations for Kroki.

177
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,180
But then I'm like, there was no movement at all.

178
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,420
Cause I had to, like, I had like no tracking enabled because I forgot how to get it to work.

179
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,200
And then after the recording, um, I, I ruined Kroki's reputation.

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,860
How dare you?

181
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,400
How dare you slander my Oshii like this?

182
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,540
I swear this never happens to him.

183
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:51,880
Um, um, um, her reputation is childish because of you.

184
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,780
And then so like after, after the podcast, I sent her like a recording of Kroki.

185
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,760
And then she was like, wait, oh my God, wait, this is actually really funny.

186
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,120
And I was like, I told you, I told you it's so much better in motion.

187
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,840
And then she, I like, she was like, I'm going to send it to my editor to like include it in.

188
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,100
But I guess like they forgot to include it in.

189
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:20,360
Uh, cause, cause I had, I recorded a redemption video for her.

190
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,380
For it to be in the podcast, but they didn't include it.

191
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,380
It was such a good video too.

192
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay.

193
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,080
Maybe I overhyped.

194
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,540
It wasn't like an amazing video, but it was like, it was all right.

195
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:36,920
Okay.

196
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,340
It was, it was pretty.

197
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:38,900
All right.

198
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,840
Okay, guys.

199
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:54,320
Um, but yes, unfortunately, um, unfortunately it didn't, um, it didn't, uh, got included in the final cut.

200
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,420
So we were not able to, we were not able to see Kroki, um, in actual motion.

201
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,140
I mean, I could, I, no, if I could give you guys a video, you guys would be like, oh, you hyped it up too.

202
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,740
Fine, fine.

203
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,480
Let me find a video real quick.

204
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,480
All right.

205
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,740
I'm trying to find a video guys.

206
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,280
Okay.

207
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,100
All right.

208
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,780
Where is it?

209
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,040
Okay.

210
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,900
Here it is.

211
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:20,920
Okay.

212
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,680
Um, the only thing I'm worried about is like, it's too loud or some shit.

213
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,080
Cause I don't know.

214
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:27,960
Hello.

215
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,520
Okay.

216
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,980
There's Kroki.

217
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,000
Okay.

218
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,620
Where, what video is this one?

219
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,500
Media source.

220
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,540
Okay.

221
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,100
Here we go.

222
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,060
There we go.

223
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,500
This is the Kroki video.

224
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,220
And you know what.

225
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,700
This is what it would have looked like if I got it to work.

226
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:49,960
I

227
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,720
told, it, it looks better in movement.

228
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,560
I told you.

229
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,240
Alright.

230
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,300
There you go.

231
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Caw Caw.

232
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,220
Caw.

233
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,720
Hello, Lily.

234
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,300
Yeah, see, this is what, this is what I sent her.

235
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,860
You overhyped it.

236
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,200
What do you mean I overhyped it so much?

237
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,960
That's why I didn't want to fucking send it.

238
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,140
I didn't want to show you guys.

239
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,080
Caw Caw.

240
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,000
I sent that to Lily and she agreed.

241
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,100
It was definitely a lot better.

242
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,020
It was a lot better in motion.

243
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,060
Caw Caw.

244
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,860
She could never be overhyped.

245
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:49,920
Alright.

246
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,780
Let's boot up.

247
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,980
Let's boot up some Eldering, guys.

248
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:53,680
Alright.

249
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,140
Let's boot up some Eldering.

250
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,580
But yeah, this is why today I'm a little sluggish today.

251
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,520
Um.

252
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,660
Um.

253
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,940
And, uh.

254
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,640
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

255
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,380
And it's going to be a short stream today.

256
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,920
Um.

257
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,580
Just because of how sluggish I feel.

258
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,220
Uh.

259
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,960
Patch or Sue.

260
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,780
Thank you for the super chat.

261
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,080
Thank you.

262
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,500
Thank you.

263
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,100
I saw you smile when you heard past Doki call.

264
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,440
Yeah.

265
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,640
Caw Caw, streamer.

266
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,860
Caw Caw.

267
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,380
It's Eldering time.

268
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,780
Alright.

269
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,660
Let me, uh.

270
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,860
Make sure that it is streaming Eldering.

271
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,540
Yippee.

272
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,240
Yeah.

273
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,660
So we're just going to vibe today.

274
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,180
We're going to vibe and maybe we'll get one boss done.

275
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,380
Maybe I'll just do one boss and call.

276
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,840
Well, one and done.

277
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,620
I'll be like, oh.

278
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,080
Heh.

279
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,080
That's a game.

280
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,200
That.

281
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,420
That's game.

282
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,400
Okay.

283
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,580
This is like.

284
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,540
Uh.

285
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,240
Okay.

286
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,960
This is like.

287
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,380
Uh.

288
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,820
Uh.

289
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,540
Out of nowhere.

290
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,400
But I saw from software.

291
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,580
And.

292
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,300
That reminded me of this video I saw.

293
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,760
Of pirate software.

294
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,020
Of like.

295
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,020
Every time he.

296
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,600
Okay.

297
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,240
There was a very funny edit.

298
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,060
About pirate software.

299
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:08,960
Where.

300
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,660
It's like.

301
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,280
Every time.

302
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,380
He talks about working at blizzard.

303
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,040
Ha.

304
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,460
Ha.

305
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:13,720
Ha.

306
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,340
Ha.

307
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,380
Ha.

308
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:14,820
Ha.

309
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:14,840
Ha.

310
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,000
Ha.

311
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,600
Ha.

312
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,760
It was such a good edit.

313
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,380
That was.

314
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,300
Ha ha ha.

315
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,700
Ha ha ha.

316
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,440
Yeah.

317
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,300
With the song.

318
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:28,880
And.

319
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,280
Okay.

320
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,340
I won't.

321
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,860
Touch much about that topic.

322
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,380
Because I know there's a lot of.

323
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,020
A lot of things.

324
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,220
A lot of things.

325
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,320
Surrounding about him.

326
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:36,940
But.

327
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,380
Um.

328
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:51,280
Um, I would say it's actually- it's fucking crazy how much this man's life changed just because he didn't press one button in World of Warcraft.

329
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,660
That's... His life trajectory changed because of this one mistake.

330
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,360
Like, which I thought was that crazy.

331
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,460
Yeah.

332
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:16,540
Like, if he didn't do that, his- I feel like his backlash would not have, like, been this crazy.

333
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,580
Yeah, he failed the QuickTime event.

334
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,080
The missed input of all time.

335
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,680
Like, actual, like, his life changed because of the QuickTime event.

336
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:54,980
Like, that was- because, like, I don't know if you guys realize- remember this, but before- before, like, all that shit happened, like, it was- like, people had, like- like, people were like, yeah, he does have an ego, but, like- But, like, people still sort of,

337
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:03,560
like, you know, thought he was a chill guy, but that- the QuickTime- the failing of that QuickTime event changed everything.

338
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,540
Oh, it's just crazy to think about.

339
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,200
Alright, let's see.

340
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,740
Oh, I actually needed- Yeah, he was seen favorably.

341
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:27,340
Alright, I assume we have to go to over here with the big, giant cup.

342
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,260
Yeah, wow made him, and wow broke him.

343
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,280
Alright, let's go.

344
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:39,900
Whee!

345
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,340
Go, horsey, go!

346
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,760
Yay!

347
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,520
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

348
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,340
Thank you, thank you.

349
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,660
I can't even imagine the joy of all of his haters are having recently.

350
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,520
Thank you for the super chat.

351
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,500
Thank you, thank you.

352
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,540
Thank you.

353
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,740
The forage of the- Oh my god, I'm gonna throw the ring!

354
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,040
Where do I- do I just go straight down?

355
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,040
Do I just go straight down?

356
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,180
I don't understand.

357
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,420
I'm gonna throw the ring.

358
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,020
Go around left side?

359
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,420
This side?

360
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,720
What if I go around here?

361
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,440
Oh, get off the horse.

362
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,920
But I have a cool horse.

363
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,320
Require materials?

364
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,990
Do I jump?

365
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,950
I don't know.

366
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,870
I don't want to get one guide.

367
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,650
Don't do it.

368
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,930
Yeah, I'm like, I don't know.

369
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,470
There seems to be suspiciously a lot of red bot- Yeah, okay.

370
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,670
Definitely we're not jumping.

371
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,850
I- Oh yeah, my death counter.

372
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,710
Yeah.

373
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,170
Okay, we're definitely not jumping after what I just saw.

374
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,250
I don't worry.

375
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,490
I got the death counter out.

376
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,830
All right.

377
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,110
All right.

378
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,630
I realized, like, I don't know why I paused.

379
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,070
Pausing in this game doesn't matter.

380
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,750
All right.

381
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:14,450
All up.

382
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,670
Left I go?

383
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,650
Question mark?

384
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,270
Jump for plus one content.

385
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,990
Okay.

386
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,670
I guess we go this way.

387
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,930
I need to jump at the right spot.

388
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,530
I assume, like, the right spot is that giant-ass hole over there.

389
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,790
I assume that's where you go.

390
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,870
Oh yeah, there it is.

391
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,710
There's a grace here.

392
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,170
So yeah.

393
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,790
It has to be.

394
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,570
There's a grace here.

395
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,030
All right.

396
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,870
How did he jump?

397
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,950
Okay.

398
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,870
I don't think that's the right...

399
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,350
Okay.

400
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,130
Oh my god, wait.

401
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,920
Wait.

402
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,360
Okay.

403
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,760
Don't worry.

404
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,080
I took my gloves off.

405
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,720
I have long observed the lands between.

406
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,760
This world is in dire need of repair and death.

407
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,980
Indiscriminate.

408
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,380
Okay.

409
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,560
Are you prepared to commit a cardinal?

410
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,220
Oh, don't worry.

411
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,000
I'd like you to wait.

412
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,560
Wait.

413
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,740
Why is there a new pool?

414
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,240
Who just died here?

415
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,860
While we were talking.

416
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,980
Oh man.

417
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,420
Am I...

418
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,320
Am I ready?

419
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,480
Am I ready to touch your hand without protection?

420
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,340
Oh my...

421
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,540
Okay.

422
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm ready.

423
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,440
I'm ready.

424
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,240
Very well.

425
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,080
Let my hand rest upon you.

426
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,580
Oh.

427
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,160
For but a moment.

428
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,180
Oh.

429
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,400
Oh.

430
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,160
Oh my god.

431
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,180
It's happening.

432
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,960
It's happening.

433
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,800
Skin on skin.

434
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,300
Oh my god.

435
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,460
It is so...

436
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,240
Wait.

437
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,480
What?

438
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,100
Oh, I'm so sorry.

439
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,440
I swear it...

440
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,700
I swear it is...

441
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,960
This is the first time this ever happened.

442
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,800
I swear I can...

443
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
Last longer.

444
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,700
I'm sorry.

445
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,940
I swear to god.

446
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,820
I...

447
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:52,980
I...

448
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,760
It's just anxiety.

449
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,580
Performance anxiety.

450
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,680
Oh, what's she doing?

451
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,530
Oh my god.

452
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,310
They're burning her.

453
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,570
Oh a tree.

454
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,550
You shall burn.

455
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,650
Right after we touched hands?

456
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,470
Was it that bad?

457
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,010
What the hell was it?

458
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,410
Was it?

459
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,210
It was that?

460
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,810
She had to burn herself right after.

461
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,870
This is why you use protection.

462
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,180
No second thing.

463
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,920
Stop, drop, and roll.

464
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,180
Thank you.

465
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,600
For guiding me here.

466
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,720
Oh.

467
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,000
Please touch my hand once more.

468
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,860
No!

469
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,660
My wife!

470
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,760
I'm going to be a single father!

471
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,260
I'm going to be a single father!

472
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,860
Shall one day meet the road of destined death.

473
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,500
Goodbye.

474
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,940
I will take care of my jellyfish child now!

475
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,520
I gotta raise the jellyfish all on my own!

476
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,830
Reload, go talk to Three Fingers, and save her!

477
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,730
It's too late!

478
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,030
I have to live with the sins I've created!

479
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,310
I'll never touch a maiden without my gloves again!

480
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,800
I'll always remember the weird protection!

481
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:27,800
I'll always keep my hands protected for the rest of my life now!

482
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,860
Is it this one?

483
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,420
Yeah.

484
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,440
Sajin, thank you for the super chat.

485
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,380
Thank you.

486
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,980
I saved it.

487
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,040
No lover and head.

488
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,340
In short, why is it always death?

489
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,180
No horse ahead.

490
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,740
I have nothing now.

491
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,040
Nothing.

492
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,560
It's almost as bad as when that guy's wife turned into the moon.

493
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,140
Keep moving.

494
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,420
There's always side quest wives.

495
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,560
I don't want side quest wives.

496
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,700
I want main storyline wife.

497
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,920
Is that a lie?

498
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,080
No, I just can't die there.

499
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,380
Okay.

500
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,500
That's rough, buddy.

501
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay.

502
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,780
How the fuck did people fuck this up?

503
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,280
Behold a back.

504
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,880
What?

505
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,900
Oh.

506
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,540
How the fuck did people fuck this up?

507
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,280
Just getting started.

508
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,060
Fear, but time for bravery.

509
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,600
Where am I?

510
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,360
Oh my god.

511
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,580
Where did I go?

512
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,260
What is this place?

513
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,280
Before I go?

514
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,540
Before I go.

515
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,500
Before I go.

516
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,640
No lover ahead.

517
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,170
I lost her.

518
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,610
I lost my beautiful wife.

519
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,870
I can't believe it.

520
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:35,150
We touched hands and then she fucking turned into a flame and disappeared.

521
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,850
Oh shit, wait, that's scary.

522
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,570
That's a lot to process, actually.

523
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,170
I...

524
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,730
This is a lot to process right now.

525
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,590
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

526
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,130
This is definitely a lot to process.

527
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,030
Okay.

528
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,070
I know I shouldn't have used that right away, but like, I fucking...

529
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,370
I was feeling a lot right there.

530
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,130
All right.

531
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,050
Look, I lost my wife.

532
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,010
I'm gr...

533
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,210
This is how I grieve.

534
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,590
I'm grieving right now.

535
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,030
All right.

536
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,590
All right.

537
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,570
Okay, that's good to know that like, his friends don't care.

538
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,110
That's good to know.

539
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,310
They're like, too busy.

540
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,470
I'm taking it out on them.

541
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,230
I'm like, I'm my wife dead!

542
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,930
Instead of drinking, I'm just beating up random people.

543
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,430
Which is like, I don't know if that's bad or not.

544
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,190
All right.

545
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,130
Nice.

546
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:49,910
All right.

547
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,810
Let's go.

548
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,450
Oh, these guys died.

549
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,470
They're pretty weak.

550
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,290
Whoops.

551
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,530
Still don't know how they died though.

552
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:03,970
Wow!

553
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:04,650
Shit!

554
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,590
Okay, okay, okay.

555
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,770
I realized I know now.

556
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

557
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:11,890
Whoa, whoa.

558
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,770
Okay, I swear, I think I know.

559
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:14,670
I...

560
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,570
Nevermind.

561
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,470
And now I know how they died.

562
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,540
Uh, too high up.

563
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,680
No horse ahead.

564
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,860
I feel like none of them has horse.

565
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,180
None of them has horse.

566
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,840
Why is that thing glowing too?

567
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,080
Alright, any, like, secret monsters anywhere?

568
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,620
Likely overcast.

569
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,580
First off, defeat.

570
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,260
Why did so many people die here?

571
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,560
What?

572
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,800
How did so many people die here?

573
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,280
Anyway.

574
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,900
Oh, that's good.

575
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,180
Alright, what do we level up, guys?

576
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,520
Dragoon Council!

577
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,400
Pick your spokesperson and tell me what to level up.

578
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,950
Mr. Broken Bomb, thank you for the super chat.

579
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,850
Thank you, thank you.

580
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:19,470
Dirkie, you were too nervous and made your hands all clammy and went and she had to dry off somehow.

581
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,890
Thank you for the super chat.

582
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,890
Thank you, thank you.

583
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,170
Okay, Vigor.

584
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,190
Alright, we got it.

585
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,000
Okay.

586
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,840
Let's grab the summoning pool, even though I'm not gonna use it.

587
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,200
At least I have precious item on my hand.

588
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,760
At least I...

589
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,200
At least I got the grace.

590
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,500
There's so many skeletons.

591
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,480
Therefore, no target lock.

592
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:49,960
Oh.

593
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,820
Those dragons seem very friendly.

594
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,000
They seem like friendly dragons.

595
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,460
Right?

596
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,260
They don't seem to, like, wanna bother me or anything.

597
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,740
Except for that guy.

598
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,620
Except for him.

599
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,400
Except for him.

600
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,220
Except for him.

601
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:08,960
It's okay.

602
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,020
I have my child that I have to raise by myself.

603
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,200
It's alright.

604
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,460
Oh my god, it's not okay.

605
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,560
Oh my god.

606
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,140
What the fuck?

607
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,720
Okay.

608
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,160
Okay.

609
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,260
Okay.

610
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,320
He was...

611
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,680
He was not very friendly.

612
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,280
What?

613
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,640
He had...

614
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,760
He definitely had the bigger sword.

615
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,000
I...

616
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,580
I was not...

617
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,680
I was not expecting that at all.

618
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,160
Wait, there's...

619
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,380
Wait, do I have any mods right now?

620
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,060
Or do I have to abandon myself?

621
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,280
I don't know.

622
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,360
So I'll just do it myself.

623
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,140
Alright.

624
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,800
It's alright.

625
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,900
I got it.

626
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,520
I was talking to my manager about, like, getting more mods in the future.

627
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,440
Oh, you're here.

628
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,800
Nice.

629
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,420
It's okay.

630
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,980
I got it.

631
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,990
Oh, shit!

632
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,470
Wait, how the fuck do I...

633
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,010
Okay, here we go.

634
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,230
Wait, what?

635
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,190
How do I...

636
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,550
Wait, I can't hit his legs.

637
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:33,790
Wait.

638
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,590
What can I...

639
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,110
Oh, I can.

640
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,950
Okay, never mind.

641
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,970
It has to be a particular part of his legs.

642
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:39,790
Alright.

643
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,590
I have to slap his toes.

644
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,350
It's fine.

645
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,910
I think I'm hitting...

646
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:48,990
Oh!

647
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:52,830
Okay.

648
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:53,950
It might...

649
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,790
I...

650
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,390
I'm not...

651
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:56,870
I'm running.

652
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,650
I don't think I'm...

653
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,350
Yeah, no.

654
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,270
I...

655
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,170
Oh, okay.

656
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:01,850
Never mind.

657
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,810
I'm leaving.

658
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,730
Never mind.

659
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,070
He doesn't even have...

660
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,970
Okay, the thing is...

661
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,670
He doesn't even have, like...

662
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,170
Natural HP bar.

663
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,730
So, like, there's no reason.

664
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,870
There's no reason to hit him.

665
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,410
Like, he doesn't even have an HP bar.

666
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,510
So, like, what's the point?

667
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,650
Oh, hey, there's Grace here.

668
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,950
It's okay.

669
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,390
My child will come back.

670
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,810
But I think...

671
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,670
I think we're planning on getting more mods.

672
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,590
So, like...

673
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,930
The other mods...

674
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,750
Don't feel...

675
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,010
Oh, try a range battle.

676
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,450
In short, let there be blood loss.

677
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,470
So, there's no...

678
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,650
So, there's less pressure for all the other mods...

679
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,370
For, like...

680
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,030
To, like...

681
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,630
Come to every stream and stuff.

682
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:46,980
Whoa.

683
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,140
But I should...

684
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,680
I should leave.

685
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,880
Yeah, like...

686
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,300
Especially for time zones, too.

687
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,220
Oh, shit.

688
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,300
Jesus, he hits so hard.

689
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,240
Yeah.

690
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,840
And then, like...

691
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,760
Less pressure for mods to, like...

692
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,920
Having to show up every stream.

693
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,820
Alright, let's go this way.

694
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,440
At least they give a lot of runes, though.

695
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,660
Which is nice.

696
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,060
Oh.

697
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,560
Ha-ha!

698
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
That's fucking right.

699
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,360
Get predicted, bitch.

700
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,200
Oh, shit!

701
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,220
I forgot about you!

702
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,580
Never mind.

703
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,300
Oh, shit!

704
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,180
It's okay.

705
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,240
I still have this.

706
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,420
I might have used all my magic.

707
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,420
But it was worth it.

708
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,000
Guys, no.

709
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,200
I'm not gonna fight the dragon.

710
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,260
He doesn't even have an actual HP bar.

711
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,580
There's no point.

712
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,160
There's no point in fighting the dragon if he doesn't even have an HP bar, guys.

713
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,580
Alright.

714
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:00,980
Okay.

715
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,400
That's fine.

716
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,340
Whoa!

717
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,080
Watch this.

718
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,000
Whoa!

719
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,600
Sorry.

720
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,880
I meant...

721
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,760
Give me a sec.

722
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,480
Okay.

723
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,440
Watch this.

724
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,420
There we go.

725
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,320
Now that was cool, wasn't it?

726
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,360
That was pretty cool, wasn't it, guys?

727
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,220
That was pretty cool, guys.

728
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,480
Alright, nice.

729
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,460
I like that they give a lot, though.

730
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:44,790
Okay.

731
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,870
Jesus Christ.

732
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,190
They hit so hard.

733
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,310
They actually hit so fucking hard.

734
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,450
Still don't know where exactly I am.

735
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,170
Let's see.

736
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:00,530
Let's see.

737
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,030
We will go...

738
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,670
Doesn't ring a head?

739
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,710
That way?

740
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,410
But what about here?

741
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,050
What is here?

742
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,930
Whoa.

743
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,590
It's the outside item?

744
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:16,830
Where is...

745
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,550
Oh, it's over here.

746
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,430
Here!

747
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,290
Yay!

748
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,070
Oh, that's a hero's rune.

749
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:24,690
So there's more.

750
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,990
Oh, that's good.

751
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,000
And then try the lever.

752
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,360
Wait, where does the lever go?

753
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,640
Okay, I...

754
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,080
Okay, guys.

755
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,000
I need you guys to help me.

756
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,100
We put poor here.

757
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,380
Oh, fuck.

758
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,220
Wait, I think...

759
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,460
Yeah.

760
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,840
Okay, I rated it poor.

761
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,420
And then...

762
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,460
And then...

763
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
Remember to...

764
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,160
Alright, we're...

765
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,720
We're...

766
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,060
Where is it?

767
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,280
Be wary of liar.

768
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,520
And then appraise this message.

769
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,780
Alright.

770
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,460
And people will be like, Whoa, I can't believe there's...

771
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,640
I can't believe this guy lied.

772
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,160
Where is this area?

773
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,420
Where am I?

774
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,280
This area is fucking huge.

775
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,780
The wary of the left.

776
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,420
I don't even know if I'm like, going the right way, to be fair.

777
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,620
Okay, I just want to make sure there's nothing here.

778
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,820
It's pretty, though.

779
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,540
What is that?

780
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,760
Oh my god, it's them.

781
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:48,580
Wait.

782
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,080
Wait.

783
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,080
Those are the...

784
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,700
Wait.

785
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,460
Those are the...

786
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,180
The tree guys.

787
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,560
Oh!

788
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,580
Wait.

789
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,860
Aren't they the tree curse?

790
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,280
Isn't this the tree curse?

791
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,780
Oh my god.

792
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,100
It is.

793
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:02,520
I'm leaving.

794
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,060
No!

795
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,740
I couldn't...

796
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,260
I didn't even have time to fucking respond to it.

797
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,100
They killed me so fast.

798
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,480
I actually wanted to leave.

799
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,320
They killed me so fast that I couldn't even respond.

800
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,940
That's so fucked up.

801
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,620
That's so fucked up.

802
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,240
How the fuck was I supposed to, like, play around that?

803
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,640
Okay, I need to get my shit back.

804
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,260
Alright.

805
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,240
Okay, remember to...

806
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:47,720
Uh...

807
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,480
Oh, nice.

808
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:48,780
Already.

809
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,140
Remember to rate this port.

810
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,620
I still see 12 appraisals.

811
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,580
I want that to go down to 1.

812
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,500
Alright.

813
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,000
Let's...

814
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,720
Let's...

815
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,240
Let's get this elevator back.

816
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,940
And grab my runes real quick.

817
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,470
Okay.

818
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,390
Alright.

819
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,230
We're gonna...

820
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,530
Let's grab our stuff.

821
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,830
And then, like, leave.

822
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,450
I am...

823
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:26,850
I...

824
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,370
I...

825
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,450
I'm not fighting this.

826
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,330
I...

827
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,970
There's another path I can take.

828
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,940
Now, after...

829
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,400
After that guy...

830
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,200
Threw up some of those death...

831
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,760
Whatever the fuck they're called...

832
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,140
I leave.

833
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,900
The streamer build does not protect me from that.

834
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,000
Exactly.

835
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,580
Whoops.

836
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,220
Okay.

837
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:54,800
It's fine.

838
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,180
They're dead.

839
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,680
Wait, what the fuck?

840
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,800
Oh my...

841
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,440
What the fuck is hitting me?

842
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,060
Oh shit!

843
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,600
It's him!

844
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,700
You know magic.

845
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,500
You must die now, nerd.

846
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,740
All nerds must die!

847
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,520
Wait.

848
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,860
Is that multiple nerds?

849
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,420
Oh fuck!

850
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,460
Guys, it was apparently, uh, multiple nerds.

851
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,800
It was, uh...

852
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,860
I was not aware that there were multiple nerds out there.

853
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:34,880
Uh...

854
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,140
I was unaware...

855
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,940
Of the situation that I was in.

856
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,060
Oh my god.

857
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,380
Please.

858
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:44,960
Please.

859
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,440
Please.

860
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

861
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,080
Okay, nice.

862
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,220
Alright.

863
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:51,800
That's fine.

864
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,180
That's fine.

865
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,680
That's fine.

866
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,420
That's fine.

867
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,300
Okay.

868
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,540
That's okay.

869
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,980
We gotta get our shit back.

870
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,430
Alright, this is fine.

871
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,870
Oh fuck, I used up all my magic.

872
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:08,230
Shit.

873
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,330
Oh shit.

874
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,810
It's fine.

875
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,110
Oh my god.

876
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,370
Oh my god, I got...

877
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:15,930
I got myself back.

878
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:16,610
I got myself back.

879
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:16,950
It's fine.

880
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:17,990
It's fine.

881
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,510
It's so fine.

882
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,310
It's so fine.

883
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,070
Light it, light it.

884
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,610
No, no, no.

885
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,770
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

886
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,230
Sit down, sit down, sit down, don't!

887
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,220
Okay, it's okay.

888
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,000
There.

889
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,700
We did it, we did it.

890
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,960
It's like nothing bad happened to me.

891
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,360
All right, nice.

892
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:56,900
Nice.

893
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,280
Sadness ahead.

894
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,280
Aww.

895
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:02,700
Poor guy.

896
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,020
Versions of friend.

897
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,000
It's not being a coward.

898
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,620
It's called bravely running away.

899
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,690
Okay, I could let... I could farm them a little bit.

900
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,300
Okay, that was supposed to... All right, that's fine.

901
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,320
That's fine.

902
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,020
That's fine.

903
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:44,720
That's fine.

904
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,580
That's fine.

905
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,080
I don't know why I couldn't backstab them, but that's okay.

906
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,340
Um... I bravely ran away.

907
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,140
I don't know why I didn't backstab, but that's okay.

908
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,360
We'll just... walk away.

909
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,620
Okay, I'll go this way.

910
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,680
And then... I guess we fall down?

911
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,320
Where are you supposed to go?

912
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,400
Seek ahead.

913
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,720
Here?

914
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,750
Wait, am I too sick?

915
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,630
Too sick.

916
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,750
I failed ahead.

917
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:38,770
No!

918
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:39,570
Whoa!

919
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,450
Okay, I almost ran off.

920
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,030
I'm too sick!

921
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,070
No!

922
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:47,250
No!

923
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,430
It's okay, guys.

924
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,490
Today's my last day where I can eat unhealthy.

925
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,890
It actually is.

926
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,110
Today is my last day.

927
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,490
Praise that message.

928
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,950
Tomorrow is when I get my pre-cooked meals.

929
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,890
So today I'm gonna order pizza.

930
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,430
Oh shit, where did he come from?

931
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,690
What the fuck?

932
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:15,990
I was being sad about being sick, and then he showed up.

933
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,870
Today's the last day.

934
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,050
Today I'm gonna order pizza, too.

935
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,010
That's fucking right.

936
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,110
I know what I want.

937
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,510
My last day.

938
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:27,370
It's like my last...

939
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:28,270
It's like my prison meal.

940
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,330
Holy shit!

941
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,210
But yeah, it's like I'm fucking...

942
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:38,530
It's like my last meal.

943
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,290
My last meal.

944
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,210
Before I...

945
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:43,890
Before I...

946
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:44,390
I'm gone.

947
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,650
That sounded so dark.

948
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,590
My final meal.

949
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,510
Alright.

950
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,410
Jesus Christ, you're fucking everywhere.

951
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,630
Alright, nice.

952
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:10,930
Alright.

953
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,870
At least they're like...

954
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,330
Sort of easy to kill.

955
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,710
There's just a lot of them.

956
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:20,490
Alright.

957
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,350
Get out of here.

958
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,270
Champion ahead?

959
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:29,250
Who's that?

960
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,880
Watch out ahead and then be wary of ambush.

961
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,880
Oh, I see him.

962
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,120
He's like all the way there.

963
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,800
Where's the ambush part?

964
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,240
Where's the ambush part?

965
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:53,560
What?

966
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,750
I don't know where the ambush part is.

967
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,050
Uh, time for a range battle?

968
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:04,290
Fuck that shit.

969
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,070
I'm just gonna walk away.

970
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,210
Like, why?

971
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:08,350
Why?

972
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:10,510
Why should I?

973
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,370
Oh, shit.

974
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,270
He might have been right.

975
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,080
Wait a minute.

976
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,800
Oh, that's right.

977
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,140
No more.

978
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,700
Oh, shit.

979
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,040
Oh, my God.

980
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:30,580
Never mind.

981
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,920
Never mind.

982
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,900
I was like, ha ha.

983
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,040
Oh, my God.

984
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,400
Oh, my God.

985
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,320
He has a friend.

986
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,640
There's no way.

987
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,020
There's no way they can't do this to me.

988
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,020
He has friends.

989
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:49,720
Okay.

990
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,760
Now I know where the prepare for the ambush came from.

991
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,440
Come on.

992
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,340
Okay.

993
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,340
Ha ha ha ha ha.

994
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,700
Ha ha ha ha.

995
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,660
That's right.

996
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,540
Whoa.

997
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:06,940
That's fucking right.

998
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:07,900
Whoa.

999
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,080
Oh, that's not.

1000
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,600
We're okay.

1001
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,400
Ha ha ha.

1002
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,560
Ha ha ha.

1003
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:15,900
Yes!

1004
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,860
Wee wee.

1005
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,020
Get out of here.

1006
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,400
There we go.

1007
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,100
Nice.

1008
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:28,880
I'm gaming.

1009
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,400
Oh, there's a grace here.

1010
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:31,880
That's good.

1011
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,540
I swear to god.

1012
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,840
I was gonna say if I missed that jump, I swear to god.

1013
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:43,960
Alright.

1014
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,800
I could upgrade my weapon.

1015
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1016
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,110
Is it in here?

1017
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:03,880
I could.

1018
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,540
Technically, yeah.

1019
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,380
It's all possible.

1020
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,140
It is possible.

1021
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,000
I could do that.

1022
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,200
Oh, I knew there was some...

1023
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,700
Wait, can I... Oh, it's on the other side.

1024
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,900
I... I was...

1025
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,040
Honestly, I was like, it could happen to me.

1026
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,920
I could just fall down that fucking hole.

1027
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,720
That seemed like something Doki would do.

1028
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,980
So are you going to?

1029
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,840
What the fuck?

1030
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,540
Where did he come from?

1031
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,300
It's okay.

1032
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,420
He can't go through this gap.

1033
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,400
Guys, did you know he'd go through that?

1034
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,060
Oh, shit.

1035
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,060
This is down.

1036
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1037
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,540
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1038
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:49,900
Okay.

1039
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,280
I feel like a lot of people died to this guy.

1040
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,160
Oh my god.

1041
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,340
Let me grab this first.

1042
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,500
Okay.

1043
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,050
I think he knows I'm here.

1044
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:15,210
Okay.

1045
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,430
I'm gonna backstab him.

1046
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:21,580
Okay.

1047
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,400
He has to turn around, right?

1048
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,780
Come on, turn around.

1049
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,560
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1050
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,420
Yeah, I can tell that he might be very strong just because of all of these, you know.

1051
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,660
Are you serious?

1052
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,640
Are you serious?

1053
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,480
That's not fair.

1054
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:42,900
Ha ha ha.

1055
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:43,740
It doesn't matter.

1056
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,120
Ha ha ha ha.

1057
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,060
That's right.

1058
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,800
Doesn't matter.

1059
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:49,960
Yeah.

1060
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,840
Still got it.

1061
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,080
Still got it.

1062
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,400
There you go.

1063
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,000
Still got my back shots.

1064
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,720
Beware of left.

1065
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,140
Oh my god.

1066
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,000
There's more of them?

1067
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,200
What the fuck?

1068
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,660
What do you mean there's more of them?

1069
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,640
Oh wait, that's a boss fight.

1070
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,980
What if I just jump down?

1071
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,330
Oh shit.

1072
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,250
Oh shit.

1073
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,030
Ha ha ha.

1074
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,470
That's a grid.

1075
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:23,570
Ho ho ho.

1076
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:25,730
Ho ho ho ho.

1077
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:28,810
It's fucking right.

1078
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,290
Oh fuck.

1079
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,830
Maybe it's not fucking right.

1080
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:35,030
Oh my god.

1081
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,850
It's not okay.

1082
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:44,590
Okay.

1083
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,930
Guys, I'm trying to fight back.

1084
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:48,110
I swear to god.

1085
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:50,370
I am trying so hard to fight back.

1086
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,050
Ha ha ha ha.

1087
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:53,530
Oh my god.

1088
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,070
This guy is so...

1089
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:55,530
Okay.

1090
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:58,650
That's good.

1091
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,150
Oh my god.

1092
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:05,410
It's fine.

1093
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,330
Okay.

1094
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:06,990
I still got it.

1095
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:07,550
I got him.

1096
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:08,730
I got him.

1097
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:09,210
It's okay.

1098
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,270
Everything is fine.

1099
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,850
I'll heal just in case.

1100
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:16,910
Cause I say it's fine.

1101
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,410
But like inside I...

1102
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,730
Ho ho.

1103
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:20,410
Oh my god.

1104
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,970
Why is there so many of them?

1105
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:23,790
Oh my god.

1106
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,430
Okay.

1107
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:27,650
Okay.

1108
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,310
It's okay.

1109
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,770
Everything is fine.

1110
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,210
There's more?!

1111
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:34,650
Alright.

1112
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:35,150
We're running.

1113
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,230
There's way too many of them.

1114
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:39,910
That's...

1115
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:40,650
That's too many.

1116
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,800
What's this?

1117
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,680
There's a summon here?

1118
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,300
That means there's a boss fight here.

1119
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,200
I'm gonna go level up then.

1120
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,600
I'm gonna...

1121
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,040
I'm gonna...

1122
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,040
I'm gonna...

1123
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,220
I'm gonna...

1124
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:57,300
I'm gonna...

1125
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,100
I'm gonna go level up.

1126
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,920
I'm not feeling it.

1127
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,220
There's a gold summons here.

1128
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,980
So that means there's a boss fight here.

1129
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,480
Oh my god.

1130
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,680
He's still chasing me.

1131
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,360
Stop.

1132
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,500
Oh my god.

1133
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:11,860
Stop.

1134
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,000
He's so obsessed with me.

1135
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,180
All right, let's...

1136
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,240
Uh, need a lot of damage.

1137
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,080
Is your armor under leveled?

1138
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,300
Wait, is it... Can it be under leveled?

1139
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,480
Are they not supposed to do that much damage?

1140
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,940
Wait, not item crafting.

1141
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,400
Uh, next thing they give us super chat.

1142
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:36,700
Thank you.

1143
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,400
Thank you.

1144
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,680
You can't... Yeah, but I can put on better armor, right?

1145
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,240
Wait, what's my... Okay, I need one more.

1146
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,200
All right.

1147
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,410
Let's see.

1148
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:08,930
Uh...

1149
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:09,830
How do we figure again?

1150
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,930
I should get Radon's armor?

1151
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:15,570
I mean, I could.

1152
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,650
What do I be like?

1153
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:19,950
I could and then I leave.

1154
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,700
Oh, I get Slow Road, better armor.

1155
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,900
Equip, like... Okay, I'll go level up my sword first, though.

1156
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,280
Yeah, I can afford it now.

1157
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,580
And then I need...

1158
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,000
Let me go...

1159
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,600
Pop my runes real quick.

1160
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,320
Pop!

1161
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,980
And then I'll pop that.

1162
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,640
And then he's Sombra, Ancient, Dragon, Smithing Stone, which I definitely don't have.

1163
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,160
I do have level six, though.

1164
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,520
I can buy level six stone.

1165
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,540
I think?

1166
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,400
I'm not sure.

1167
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,840
So we'll double check.

1168
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,560
Oh, hey, item.

1169
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,440
Who dropped this here?

1170
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,400
Oh, nice.

1171
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,640
Wait, someone died?

1172
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,560
Wait, he's dead?

1173
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,720
How did he die?

1174
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,500
Who killed him?

1175
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,720
Was there a murder in this table?

1176
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,940
Who killed this man?

1177
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,180
What?

1178
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,060
Oh my god!

1179
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,980
Wait,

1180
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,600
she died too?

1181
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:45,570
What the fuck?

1182
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:51,130
A quest expired, so did he.

1183
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,810
I'm not a murderer, right?

1184
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,450
No, that can't be.

1185
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:59,610
No, I'm not a murderer.

1186
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,230
No, it can't be me.

1187
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,530
No, there's no way.

1188
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,330
No, oh my god.

1189
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,690
Oh my god, who killed this guy?

1190
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,790
Oh my god.

1191
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,230
Why are there so many dead people here?

1192
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,070
There's no way.

1193
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,110
There's no witnesses.

1194
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,910
No evidence that would put me on the scene of the crime.

1195
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,430
A new drip though.

1196
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:34,030
You're right.

1197
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:35,890
You need a free armor.

1198
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,770
Who did this?

1199
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:43,030
Who could have done such a thing?

1200
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,270
But he's alive?

1201
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,610
Out of everyone, the shiteaters alive?

1202
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,600
All right.

1203
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,860
That's crazy that he's the only one that lives.

1204
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,040
You want him dead too?

1205
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,060
What the fuck?

1206
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,940
Wait, was it six that I needed?

1207
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,260
Oh, it was eight.

1208
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:12,720
Whoops.

1209
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,320
Um, and thank you for the super chat.

1210
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:17,640
Thank you.

1211
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,300
Thank you.

1212
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,460
Thank you.

1213
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:18,840
That was not right.

1214
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,280
Super chat.

1215
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,140
Thank you for the rate.

1216
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:20,700
Thank you.

1217
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,540
Thank you.

1218
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,020
Sorry.

1219
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,900
Thank you for the rate.

1220
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:29,900
All right.

1221
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,580
I got a little frazzle there.

1222
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,600
Because some people are calling me a murderer.

1223
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,820
But I was not there at the scene of the crime.

1224
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,340
I have an alibi.

1225
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,560
I touched a maiden's hand unprotected.

1226
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,580
And then, like, I fell asleep right after.

1227
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,020
She said it was okay.

1228
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,280
She said it's okay.

1229
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,240
It can happen sometimes.

1230
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,460
And, like, she was satisfied.

1231
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,360
Oh, where is Roderica?

1232
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,400
Thank you for the super chat, Sage.

1233
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,020
Thank you.

1234
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:09,800
Thank you.

1235
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,540
All right.

1236
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,260
Let's see.

1237
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,140
That's 20.

1238
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,300
Oh, is it worth it?

1239
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,440
I feel like I could just farm the...

1240
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,900
Yeah, I'll just farm the last...

1241
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,580
Farm it.

1242
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,540
Guys, we're gonna go to our favorite place.

1243
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,480
Guys, I just need...

1244
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,420
I don't...

1245
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,760
We're gonna go to our favorite place.

1246
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,620
I don't care if there's easier farming places.

1247
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,160
We're back.

1248
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,040
We're back to our favorite...

1249
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,900
It's Groundhog Day!

1250
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,820
We're back!

1251
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,000
It's our favorite place, guys.

1252
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,620
It's our favorite place.

1253
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:01,840
Look.

1254
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,320
It just works, okay?

1255
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,480
See?

1256
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,280
Look at that.

1257
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,260
I got enough.

1258
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,800
This is the best place to grind.

1259
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,740
The more things change, the more they stay the same.

1260
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,920
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1261
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,320
Thank you.

1262
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:20,960
Thank you.

1263
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,320
Flashback of Pigfisting.

1264
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,080
Look.

1265
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,280
I know, like...

1266
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,120
Is this the most efficient farming area?

1267
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,600
Maybe not.

1268
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,340
Is this the best farming area?

1269
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,220
Maybe not.

1270
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,900
There's no butt here.

1271
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:47,960
All right.

1272
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:49,560
Nice.

1273
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,700
That should be enough, right?

1274
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,640
Yeah, that should be enough.

1275
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,580
It was like a thousand or so.

1276
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,320
Please just farm the birds.

1277
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,840
What's the positives here?

1278
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,560
We get to spend a longer time together.

1279
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,980
Is that not what you want?

1280
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,380
Yeah,

1281
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:16,880
we needed to.

1282
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:21,290
All right.

1283
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,490
And then...

1284
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:23,830
I think that's enough to upgrade.

1285
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:24,410
We'll see.

1286
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,250
All right.

1287
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:28,910
Oh, my God.

1288
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:30,110
I forgot we have to buy...

1289
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,830
We have to level up a child, too.

1290
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,170
I forgot about that.

1291
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:34,670
Oh, yeah?

1292
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:35,430
No, okay.

1293
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,170
I don't have enough for it.

1294
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:38,690
Wait, no.

1295
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:39,270
It's two.

1296
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:40,650
Okay, okay.

1297
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,250
Maybe we do.

1298
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,190
Okay, let's talk to how many...

1299
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,310
We have to level up a child.

1300
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,190
I forgot about her.

1301
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:46,530
Ever since I've been...

1302
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:47,970
Look, being a single parent is very hard.

1303
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:48,370
Okay?

1304
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:54,510
Don't worry, which is why I need your help persuading Master Hugh to leave.

1305
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:57,650
His roots are so knotted in this place.

1306
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,950
He won't last much longer if he stays here.

1307
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,090
His shackles are broken.

1308
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,130
He's a free man now.

1309
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:08,750
It's high time he put the round table behind him.

1310
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:09,310
Wait, what?

1311
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:11,970
Okay.

1312
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,630
I need six of those.

1313
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,150
So, how much do I need?

1314
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:19,770
All right.

1315
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,730
I need...

1316
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:21,470
I know...

1317
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:21,630
Okay.

1318
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,370
It's level six, right?

1319
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:28,710
I have...

1320
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,230
Do I have it?

1321
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:30,770
Oh, I do.

1322
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:32,310
It's...

1323
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:33,030
It's this.

1324
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:33,610
So...

1325
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:34,930
Oh my god, they're so expensive.

1326
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:36,490
Holy fuck.

1327
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,410
Why is he...

1328
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,990
Why is it so...

1329
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:40,150
Okay.

1330
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,190
Oh, talk to the smith again?

1331
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:42,670
Okay.

1332
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:43,990
Talk to him.

1333
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:45,970
I need one.

1334
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:46,350
Okay.

1335
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:49,990
Let's see.

1336
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:53,210
Lay out your arms.

1337
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,230
Why are you still making weapons?

1338
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:02,050
As I've always said, you came to challenge the demigods and their god.

1339
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:03,610
To slay them.

1340
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:07,550
And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons.

1341
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,730
It is what I wish.

1342
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:13,750
To smith a weapon for you to slay a god.

1343
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:14,790
Yay!

1344
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,410
I mean, that seems like a good...

1345
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,670
He's here for me, guys.

1346
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:19,730
Not for her.

1347
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:20,790
For me.

1348
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:21,230
All right.

1349
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,130
So what is the easiest place to farm?

1350
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,130
What is it?

1351
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:30,450
If you guys can't give me a good answer, I'm going back to the catacombs.

1352
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:31,110
All right.

1353
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,550
I'll go back.

1354
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,050
11k of bird.

1355
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:41,410
Nor...

1356
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,990
We don't have that, guys.

1357
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,130
We don't have a nor...

1358
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:45,730
Kaelin.

1359
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,010
We don't have it.

1360
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,150
Mog's place?

1361
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,850
The fuck is Mog's place?

1362
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,150
Marwan's palace?

1363
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:56,270
Do I even have that?

1364
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:59,930
Where is that?

1365
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:00,930
What is that?

1366
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,890
There's no palace here.

1367
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,690
Oh, I've never been there.

1368
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:12,170
All right.

1369
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:13,550
What is the second best place?

1370
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,000
Okay.

1371
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,180
Where is the...

1372
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,980
What is the...

1373
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,280
I'm not going to kill the fucking dragon.

1374
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,080
I know that dragon is going to...

1375
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,220
It's going to fuck me up.

1376
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,260
All right.

1377
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,120
Why not?

1378
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,180
I guess it's going to fuck me up.

1379
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,280
What do you want?

1380
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,900
Oh, you mean that dragon that's protected by 20 of her kids?

1381
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:55,300
Yeah.

1382
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,300
No, it's fine.

1383
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:03,840
That dragon is going to take me 20 years.

1384
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,400
It's a fucking slay.

1385
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,680
It's fine.

1386
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,640
Do it, you wuss.

1387
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,120
It dies to bleed in three minutes.

1388
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:29,100
Don't you have to, like, find, like, a perfect, like, location to do it?

1389
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:33,880
Like, like, you have to position yourself in a way where, uh...

1390
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,180
It's not even sleeping.

1391
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,700
It's li- I like, I like, don't worry.

1392
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,120
It's...

1393
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,900
Isn't it, like, fucking paralyzed?

1394
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,760
Like, it's like, you want me to beat up a paraplegic dragon.

1395
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,880
That is fucked up.

1396
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,640
That...

1397
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,220
That is fucked up.

1398
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,300
Bro, that dragon...

1399
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:59,340
That dragon's li- Literally going through so much.

1400
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,420
She's just old.

1401
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,300
Yes.

1402
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,080
Hahaha.

1403
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,440
That's too far, Dookie.

1404
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:13,680
Out of everything you've done, that's where you draw the line.

1405
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:18,180
I have...

1406
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,380
I have standards, okay?

1407
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,020
I have standards here.

1408
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:30,780
In front of our children?

1409
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:38,710
But, Dookie, you're on your will.

1410
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,610
That's since when?

1411
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,010
This is where I draw the line.

1412
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:46,570
Killing, um...

1413
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:54,330
Killing someone that's clearly paralyzed in front of her children.

1414
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,970
That's where I draw the line.

1415
01:06:57,270 --> 01:07:01,450
If she was, like, if she was able-bodied, then that's different.

1416
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:11,930
If, if she was not suffering from a, from a, uh, from a disease, and was physically healthy, then that's different.

1417
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:13,430
I, I would go for her.

1418
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,970
But, like, because...

1419
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,860
Yeah, that's, I have a high moral ground.

1420
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,200
Hahaha.

1421
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:37,150
Alright, let's see.

1422
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:37,710
Let's buy.

1423
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,190
Let's buy...

1424
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,310
This one grave love word.

1425
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,800
They can't watch if they're dead.

1426
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,200
Next, thank you for the super chat thing.

1427
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,000
Thank you.

1428
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,740
Alright, let's upgrade her.

1429
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,120
Upgrade this.

1430
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,620
And then I need level 9, which I don't have.

1431
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,140
Oh my monkey, thank you for the super chat thing.

1432
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:10,920
Thank you.

1433
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,500
Alright, uh, where was I for this area?

1434
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,300
Is it here?

1435
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,820
Dragon temple or crumbling?

1436
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,360
Oh yeah, we'll try the dragon temple.

1437
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,540
Yeah, I knew it was here.

1438
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,800
I feel like I could just run past all of this, right?

1439
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,560
Yeah.

1440
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:40,780
Whoa.

1441
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,860
There might be a lot to run past though.

1442
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,100
Which is a little concerning.

1443
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,160
Maybe they'll get tired.

1444
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,420
Wait, what happened to the summon?

1445
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:54,800
Wait.

1446
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:56,740
Wow!

1447
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:01,530
Wait a minute.

1448
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:02,670
What happened to the summon?

1449
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:03,410
Hello?

1450
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:05,290
Oh, shit.

1451
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:05,710
Oh, shit.

1452
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:06,350
I thought I could...

1453
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,490
I thought I could backstab you.

1454
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:07,910
JK.

1455
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:09,290
JK.

1456
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,730
Is it still there?

1457
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:14,410
Oh, it is.

1458
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,350
Yes.

1459
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,770
Alright, don't worry.

1460
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:22,350
He'll help me.

1461
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,130
Oh my god.

1462
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,150
Don't worry.

1463
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:29,970
You'll help me, right?

1464
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:32,090
Oh my god.

1465
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,260
Alright, that's fine.

1466
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,180
He'll help me.

1467
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,380
Oh my god.

1468
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,900
I don't know if this is a good use of him.

1469
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,180
I'm not so scared.

1470
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,460
He's definitely dead, guys.

1471
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,360
I think he's dead.

1472
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:08,020
Why did this guy come f-

1473
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:26,130
Oh my god.

1474
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,010
How do I...

1475
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:30,850
There has to be a...

1476
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,870
There has to be an easier way.

1477
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,630
There has to be an easier way.

1478
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:39,890
There's no way.

1479
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:43,770
That's it.

1480
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:44,750
I'm just gonna do this.

1481
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,590
Like, g- Fuck this.

1482
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:47,730
Okay.

1483
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:54,510
I'll just do this.

1484
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,730
This is actually easier.

1485
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,310
Like, this is actually easy.

1486
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:01,630
This is fine.

1487
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:02,450
This is fine.

1488
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:03,510
This is so fine.

1489
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,230
This is actually easier.

1490
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:12,670
Alright.

1491
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:18,770
We'll just wait.

1492
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:22,370
We'll just wait.

1493
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:23,250
Is it death counter?

1494
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:24,070
I think it is.

1495
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,210
We'll fix it later.

1496
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,420
Just run.

1497
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,000
Just keep running.

1498
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,120
Just keep running.

1499
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,400
Is he still there?

1500
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,680
But he's not there anymore.

1501
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,220
Oh, he's still there.

1502
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,000
Okay.

1503
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:50,340
Nice.

1504
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,680
Oh, shit.

1505
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,200
Oh, shit.

1506
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:57,940
It's these guys.

1507
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,340
Oh, shit.

1508
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,400
I didn't summon him.

1509
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,940
Oh, my God.

1510
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:07,800
I forgot to wait for them to get summoned.

1511
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,880
Oh, shit.

1512
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,660
Not these guys.

1513
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,200
Oh, shit.

1514
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:26,370
I forgot to wait for my guy to get summoned before I show up.

1515
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:27,790
It's okay.

1516
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:30,190
I know all about you.

1517
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:31,330
That's right.

1518
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:33,610
I've heard so much about these guys.

1519
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:34,830
That's right.

1520
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:35,370
Look at me go.

1521
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:36,670
I'm not cheesing it.

1522
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:39,710
I'm not using that stupid sleep cheese.

1523
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:40,330
Look at me.

1524
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,570
I'm a fucking real gamer.

1525
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:44,610
That's right.

1526
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:45,070
That's right.

1527
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:47,970
I'm doing that the legit way.

1528
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:51,110
Okay.

1529
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:56,550
Okay.

1530
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,450
You guys gotta give me like a little high five though.

1531
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:00,970
I didn't suck.

1532
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:03,130
I didn't do the abuse tech though for this.

1533
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:04,210
Let me go.

1534
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,630
I'm fighting him legitly.

1535
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:12,650
All right.

1536
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:16,650
I think this is fine.

1537
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:18,390
Wait, what?

1538
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:19,330
Wait, what?

1539
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,010
Oh, my God.

1540
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:23,830
Okay.

1541
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:24,990
Now I know why they...

1542
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:25,330
Okay.

1543
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:25,790
Never mind.

1544
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,770
Now I know why people did not fight them legitly.

1545
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:31,090
Now I know.

1546
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:33,210
Never mind.

1547
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:35,290
Now I know why they sleep them.

1548
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:36,810
Now I know why.

1549
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:38,230
I took...

1550
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:38,410
Oh, yeah.

1551
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,910
Oh, I...

1552
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:41,770
Oh, now I know.

1553
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:42,490
Now...

1554
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,410
Now I know.

1555
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:45,630
I thought...

1556
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,970
After they die...

1557
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:48,990
That, you know...

1558
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:52,330
I don't have to worry about it anymore.

1559
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:54,850
But clearly, I was wrong.

1560
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:02,610
I'll just kill this guy first.

1561
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:03,950
And then I'll run past.

1562
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:09,270
Let's see.

1563
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:13,400
Okay.

1564
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:15,780
Oh, my God.

1565
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,380
That's bullshit.

1566
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:17,940
That's bullshit!

1567
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:19,840
Oh, my God.

1568
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,420
Oh, my God.

1569
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,440
Let me at you.

1570
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,920
Let me go around!

1571
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:28,460
Oh, my God.

1572
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:28,980
Never mind.

1573
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,380
I don't want to fight them anymore.

1574
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,340
Never mind.

1575
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:32,880
I'm leaving.

1576
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:34,140
Oh, wait.

1577
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:34,740
I can't leave.

1578
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:35,980
Oh, my God.

1579
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:36,380
That's fine.

1580
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,300
I'm gonna grab my shit.

1581
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,280
I'm leaving.

1582
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,200
Wait.

1583
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,160
I gotta summon though.

1584
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,880
I gotta summon.

1585
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,460
No, guys.

1586
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,520
Guys, you don't understand.

1587
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,520
I gotta summon them.

1588
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,000
Okay.

1589
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:57,920
Oh, my God.

1590
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:58,660
Oh, my God.

1591
01:14:58,820 --> 01:14:59,380
Oh, my God.

1592
01:14:59,480 --> 01:14:59,560
No.

1593
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,060
No, no, no, no, no.

1594
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:01,960
No, no, no, no.

1595
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:02,880
Please.

1596
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:03,900
Please show up.

1597
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:04,860
Please show up.

1598
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:06,000
Oh, my God!

1599
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,420
Where is he?!

1600
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,080
Where are you?

1601
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,740
Where is he?

1602
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,290
I swear to God.

1603
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:28,610
I'm trying to summon him.

1604
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,030
Please show up.

1605
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:31,670
Please.

1606
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:32,810
Please.

1607
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,310
I didn't stay in place.

1608
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:36,670
Oh my God.

1609
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:37,450
That's so bullshit.

1610
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:39,510
Oh my God.

1611
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:40,310
I didn't need it.

1612
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:42,390
I didn't need to stay in place.

1613
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:43,330
He was there.

1614
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:49,490
Who

1615
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:56,850
said I needed to stay in place?

1616
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:01,970
Who fucking... Who fucking said I needed to stay in place?

1617
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:02,870
That's it.

1618
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:03,610
I'm banning you.

1619
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:08,530
That's it.

1620
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:09,770
That's it.

1621
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:14,050
When there's no more guy, I can never get one guy.

1622
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:20,630
I'll find you.

1623
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:24,310
I... Oh, the D-Zone.

1624
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:25,350
I see you.

1625
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:27,010
I see you.

1626
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:28,390
That's right.

1627
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,770
I see you.

1628
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,910
Any last messages, Mr. D-Zone?

1629
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,510
Don't think you stay silent.

1630
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:39,770
I won't let it.

1631
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:42,910
Chad.

1632
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:45,870
She said my name.

1633
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:47,230
07.

1634
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:48,470
That's it.

1635
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,550
Put user in timeout.

1636
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:52,550
24 hours.

1637
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:57,490
Can't get one guy if he's in timeout.

1638
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:59,730
Down he goes.

1639
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:03,850
Why are you blaming your death honor?

1640
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:05,930
He's no random anymore.

1641
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:08,970
He... Not D-Zone.

1642
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:10,370
Alright.

1643
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,090
It's fine.

1644
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:15,850
It's fine.

1645
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:18,630
Apparently there's an easier grace, but it's fine.

1646
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:21,190
I've committed my sins.

1647
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,170
Oh shit.

1648
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:26,470
Holy shit.

1649
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:32,630
Oh my...

1650
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,140
Oh my...

1651
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:36,040
Oh no!

1652
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:40,440
Oh my god!

1653
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,240
Go in!

1654
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,140
Go in!

1655
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,300
Go in!

1656
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:45,580
You're coming in here now!

1657
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,920
Come in here!

1658
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,540
Come in here!

1659
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,240
Stop fighting them!

1660
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,320
Come in here!

1661
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,480
He's supposed to come in here!

1662
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,540
I thought he would show up!

1663
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,500
Why is he not- Why is he not in here?!

1664
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:14,870
I thought he was like... I don't know.

1665
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,810
I thought he would come in here with me.

1666
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:18,190
Like, I don't know.

1667
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:19,290
I...

1668
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,330
He died!

1669
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:25,450
He died before he could even come in here!

1670
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,230
Oh my god!

1671
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:28,910
Oh my god!

1672
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:30,370
Oh my god!

1673
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:31,950
I already died with a bomb!

1674
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:36,190
I... I... I don't know.

1675
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:39,130
I thought he would... I thought he would show up.

1676
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:41,490
I saw him and I were cool like that, you know?

1677
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:45,450
So, I legit thought we were... he and I were cool like that.

1678
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:53,870
How was I supposed to know he can just die?

1679
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:01,190
I thought he and I would be cool like that.

1680
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:05,330
That's fine.

1681
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:08,430
I can't fight him before I can...

1682
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:09,890
Oh my god, never mind.

1683
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:10,650
I cannot.

1684
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,550
Why did you abandon him, bro?

1685
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:24,590
Now you know what for him he died for you.

1686
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:29,090
Alright, where is the closer Grace?

1687
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:32,650
Alright, let's find the Grace that's closer.

1688
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:36,470
So, about the other Grace...

1689
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:39,290
So... so where is the other...

1690
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:41,550
The other Grace?

1691
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:50,180
Go west.

1692
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,120
Alright.

1693
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:57,900
Like here?

1694
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,620
Right there?

1695
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,460
Alright, I'm gonna pick up this item first.

1696
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:12,820
OUGH!

1697
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:18,860
Cool.

1698
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:20,880
That's... alright.

1699
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,260
That's... fine.

1700
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,260
That's... fine.

1701
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:28,720
I had nothing anyway.

1702
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,540
I... I had... oh wait, the counter works now.

1703
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,780
I'm not counting.

1704
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:35,820
That's...

1705
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:37,780
That's...

1706
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:38,200
That's fine.

1707
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,560
I had nothing anyway.

1708
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,600
In my life.

1709
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,120
Okay.

1710
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,260
That's fine.

1711
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:56,740
That's fine.

1712
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:57,280
That's fine.

1713
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,540
We can... make this jump now.

1714
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,260
It's alright.

1715
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,080
It's okay.

1716
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:07,940
This fucker.

1717
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,360
This actual fucker.

1718
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:16,380
It's okay.

1719
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:21,780
Oh...

1720
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,140
My god.

1721
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:27,220
Get out of here.

1722
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,440
Get your ass out of here.

1723
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:38,680
Get your ass out of my lobby!

1724
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,020
Fucking get out!

1725
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,220
Get out!

1726
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:47,280
What did I get from that?

1727
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,720
Okay, that item is worth it.

1728
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,780
The item is worth it, guys.

1729
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,440
Can I jump here?

1730
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:56,320
Do I live?

1731
01:21:58,640 --> 01:21:59,580
Okay, nice.

1732
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,000
I do.

1733
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,180
Try left.

1734
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:07,850
Why?

1735
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:12,980
Wait, do I go right or left?

1736
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:15,360
Where's the grace?

1737
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,380
Where the fuck is that grace?

1738
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:26,500
What is this?

1739
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,460
No clue?

1740
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:39,900
Do I just go straight here?

1741
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,440
In...

1742
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,040
In that area?

1743
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:45,680
In this area?

1744
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:54,390
Okay.

1745
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:59,550
Oh my god.

1746
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:03,730
Wait.

1747
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:06,210
Why would I be here?

1748
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:12,060
How is this closer?

1749
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:13,340
How is this closer?

1750
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:14,080
Oh, there it is.

1751
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,100
Oh, there is a grace here.

1752
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,180
How would this place be closer?

1753
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,340
I don't understand.

1754
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:29,570
Oh!

1755
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:31,590
But my summons!

1756
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:34,310
Oh, he's over here.

1757
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:35,170
Oh, there he is.

1758
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,670
There you go.

1759
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:36,770
My summons.

1760
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:37,030
Yay!

1761
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:41,690
It's like, what about my summons?

1762
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:42,410
Oh, he's here.

1763
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:43,130
It's okay.

1764
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:43,970
He's right here, guys.

1765
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:47,910
Yay!

1766
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:48,450
Hey!

1767
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:49,850
Alright.

1768
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:50,470
Time.

1769
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:53,290
This time, we got this.

1770
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:55,990
Ring, ring, ring!

1771
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,490
Oh my god.

1772
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:00,750
Okay, that's awkward.

1773
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:03,250
But this time, this time, it'll be fine.

1774
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:09,090
Oh my god.

1775
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:10,710
I don't feel so good.

1776
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,390
I don't feel so good, actually.

1777
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:13,070
Yeah.

1778
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:15,330
Okay.

1779
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:16,650
It's fine.

1780
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:17,890
You get him, I'll get him.

1781
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:20,670
I'll get the one...

1782
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:26,640
Never mind.

1783
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,480
Never mind.

1784
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:28,800
Okay.

1785
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,600
Okay, now I know exactly what...

1786
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,480
I was not healthy.

1787
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:36,920
Okay.

1788
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:38,900
Okay, I know what to do now.

1789
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,800
Did you get him?

1790
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:42,940
Um...

1791
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:43,980
Um...

1792
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,880
Okay, I know what to do now, guys.

1793
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,160
Okay, now I know why...

1794
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,160
Guys, now I know why...

1795
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,220
People sleep...

1796
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:53,720
Sleep him.

1797
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:57,040
And why people do the cheese strap for this...

1798
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:57,740
For this.

1799
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,140
Now I understand.

1800
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:03,760
Put him closer to them, so it's like scarier.

1801
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,700
Oh my god, they're just wailing on them.

1802
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,480
Okay.

1803
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,800
I'll separate them.

1804
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,100
Oh my god.

1805
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:17,920
Oh my god.

1806
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:18,540
Okay, it's fine.

1807
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:21,020
Oh my god, why do I get him?

1808
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,020
Why do I get him?

1809
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:22,720
That's the separation!

1810
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,940
I wanted a skinny man!

1811
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:26,300
There we go.

1812
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:32,610
Okay.

1813
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:34,510
Okay, it's fine.

1814
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:35,750
It's fine.

1815
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:39,830
I can do...

1816
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:39,890
One more swing!

1817
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:39,930
Nice.

1818
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:40,110
And then I'll do a heal here.

1819
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:40,150
Okay.

1820
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:41,190
Okay.

1821
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:44,410
Oh no.

1822
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:45,790
Oh no, he's rolling.

1823
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:46,830
He's rolling.

1824
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:48,830
Oh fuck!

1825
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:49,530
Yeah!

1826
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:52,610
Why me!

1827
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:55,950
Okay.

1828
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:00,880
It's fine.

1829
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,600
I can do...

1830
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,480
One more swing!

1831
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:05,160
Nice.

1832
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,720
And then I'll do a heal here.

1833
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,060
And then...

1834
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:10,720
Slam!

1835
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,120
Oh shit!

1836
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,040
Oh!

1837
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,860
I missed it!

1838
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,900
I was not fast enough!

1839
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,500
I was not fast enough for the Slam!

1840
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,500
It's okay.

1841
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,040
It's okay.

1842
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,280
We're heroes.

1843
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:28,500
You and...

1844
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,400
That means there's one more.

1845
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,140
I remember.

1846
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:33,360
I killed a skinny man first, so he's less scary.

1847
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,160
Oh my god!

1848
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:36,760
That's not...

1849
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:37,100
Wait!

1850
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,100
It's the last one?!

1851
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:40,640
Okay.

1852
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:42,640
Clearly I was wrong.

1853
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:44,420
Alright.

1854
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,740
I thought, you know, it would be like the first one you kill.

1855
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:51,960
But I was wrong.

1856
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:54,860
Okay.

1857
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,380
Oh my god!

1858
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:57,180
Oh my god!

1859
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:58,820
I missed it!

1860
01:26:58,920 --> 01:26:59,140
I missed it!

1861
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,140
I missed it!

1862
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:01,500
I missed it!

1863
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,440
It's okay!

1864
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,720
We don't need critical hits!

1865
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,060
Where we're from!

1866
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:09,980
It's okay!

1867
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,460
We don't need that!

1868
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,920
We're good enough without it!

1869
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:17,920
Oh my god!

1870
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:18,560
Oh my god!

1871
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:19,940
Why?!

1872
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,560
We don't need it still!

1873
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,700
We don't need critical hits!

1874
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:28,500
Where we're from!

1875
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,480
We're gangster like that!

1876
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,800
Low-key carrying?!

1877
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,720
I was the...

1878
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,220
Oh shit!

1879
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,200
Um, excuse me!

1880
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:40,400
I summoned him!

1881
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,120
I did it!

1882
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,220
Let's go!

1883
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,280
I did it!

1884
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:47,660
Guys!

1885
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:48,740
Oh my god!

1886
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,460
We're gaming!

1887
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:50,880
We're so good!

1888
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:51,480
Sorry!

1889
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,740
I'm so good!

1890
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:53,720
I...

1891
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,400
Look at that guys!

1892
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:57,380
I didn't use the, uh...

1893
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,240
The sleep cheese!

1894
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,060
Okay?

1895
01:27:59,480 --> 01:27:59,820
I...

1896
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,040
I...

1897
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:03,200
I...

1898
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,060
I...

1899
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,580
I didn't use the sleep cheese!

1900
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:07,840
All...

1901
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:07,920
All...

1902
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:09,700
Me...

1903
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:14,700
Roll into you with my thousand kg body!

1904
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:15,600
Uh...

1905
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,340
Thank you for the super chat!

1906
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:17,780
Thank you!

1907
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,500
Thank you!

1908
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:20,440
Thank you for the super chat!

1909
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:20,760
Thank you!

1910
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,420
Thank you!

1911
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,220
Alright!

1912
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:23,960
Okay guys!

1913
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:24,760
What do we level up?

1914
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,600
We can level up two times here!

1915
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,720
While you guys decide, I'm gonna use the bathroom!

1916
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:29,240
I'll be back!

1917
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,400
How do I bring these own back guys?

1918
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,320
Quick!

1919
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:37,920
What is this?

1920
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:40,520
A mutiny from my own mods?

1921
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:43,600
Maybe you wanna know what it's like to be a regular dragoon?

1922
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,040
Silence!

1923
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:50,640
Why...

1924
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,460
Do you wanna be back with the...

1925
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,600
Back with...

1926
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,000
To be one of them?

1927
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:57,900
Do...

1928
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:58,920
Do you...

1929
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,460
What if...

1930
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:02,220
What if...

1931
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:02,340
What if...

1932
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:04,420
If you like D-zone so much?

1933
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:05,040
Maybe...

1934
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,200
You should be there with him!

1935
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,920
No more power for you!

1936
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,120
I'm silent!

1937
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:18,840
No!

1938
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,280
I'm silent!

1939
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,780
Sound guy!

1940
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:25,780
Got you!

1941
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:27,480
Oh yeah?

1942
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,780
You wanna fight with Silent?

1943
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,560
Who wants Silent's position?

1944
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,380
Who wants Silent's position?

1945
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,800
By being with him!

1946
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:37,700
You are...

1947
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,280
Are you sure you're Silent?

1948
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:42,560
Don't you want the...

1949
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,720
Don't you also wanna be a mod too?

1950
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,940
Let me take...

1951
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:48,520
Let me take...

1952
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,160
I'll take it!

1953
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:51,820
We are Silent!

1954
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,720
By having someone demoted...

1955
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,180
Someone has to be promoted too!

1956
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,180
Maybe he was really Silent...

1957
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:01,800
This would ha...

1958
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:02,660
Wouldn't have happened...

1959
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:03,140
Exactly!

1960
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,540
There you go!

1961
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:06,180
Fight with the bourgeoisie!

1962
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:07,020
Next scene!

1963
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,640
Thank you for the super chat!

1964
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,080
Thank you!

1965
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:09,780
Thank you!

1966
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,400
Lord Kurosis!

1967
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,620
You can...

1968
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:13,080
Buy...

1969
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:13,840
My...

1970
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:14,460
Silence!

1971
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,320
Sorry!

1972
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,600
Thank you for the super chat!

1973
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:17,940
Thank you!

1974
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:18,660
Thank you!

1975
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,860
Shout out to my goat!

1976
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:20,240
Oh!

1977
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:21,680
I guess you did alright too!

1978
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:22,140
Doki!

1979
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,100
Alright!

1980
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:24,980
What are we getting?

1981
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,000
Bigger and endurance!

1982
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:26,620
Okay!

1983
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,640
Maybe the real Silent was the friends we all made...

1984
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,340
We made all along the way!

1985
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:44,360
Slips 5 bucks under the Silent interview table!

1986
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,200
Thank you for the super chat, Mehdi!

1987
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:46,760
Thank you!

1988
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:47,620
Thank you!

1989
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:50,900
Alright!

1990
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:52,840
What is all of this?

1991
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:54,140
Offer...

1992
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:54,840
Rump...

1993
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:55,440
Where?

1994
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:56,680
Haha!

1995
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:57,760
Where is it?

1996
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,360
First off, well done!

1997
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:03,380
Where do I go after this?

1998
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,880
Maybe it's like this way?

1999
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,700
Wait, where do I go after being the boss?

2000
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:14,880
I'm so confused!

2001
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,440
Here?

2002
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:19,800
Go down?

2003
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,440
I mean, it would make sense, right?

2004
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:28,750
I mean, there is like...

2005
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:29,990
A thing over there!

2006
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:39,930
Shortcut ahead?

2007
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:40,830
Yeah?

2008
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:43,570
Whoa!

2009
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,360
Oh my god!

2010
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:47,740
That's lead!

2011
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:48,680
Oh my god!

2012
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:48,780
No!

2013
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:49,320
That's electricity!

2014
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,220
Okay!

2015
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,600
I'm gonna kill him before he kills me!

2016
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:57,280
Nice!

2017
01:32:59,020 --> 01:32:59,780
Nice!

2018
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:01,920
Yeah!

2019
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:02,520
What?

2020
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,600
Detected the shortcut?

2021
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:06,220
Question mark?

2022
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:10,480
Oh shit!

2023
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:10,840
Dog!

2024
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,900
Okay, I don't trust myself with a dog.

2025
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:17,120
In Elden Ring.

2026
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:21,160
Okay?

2027
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,440
Not fair!

2028
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:25,140
Hahaha!

2029
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:27,560
Dad!

2030
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:28,780
You're like, Dad?

2031
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:29,540
Hahaha!

2032
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:32,600
Hahaha!

2033
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:36,560
That's right!

2034
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:36,900
Alright!

2035
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:40,780
Alright, I'm opening interviews to repla- Uh, not re- Hahaha!

2036
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,580
To replace silent breakbeat!

2037
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:45,540
Hahaha!

2038
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,440
Hahaha!

2039
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:47,700
Hahaha!

2040
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:53,940
No loyalty deserves a demotion!

2041
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,800
Behold, Elden Ring!

2042
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,300
If everything is Elden Ring, then what is not Elden Ring?

2043
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,760
I'll do it!

2044
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:12,540
Alright!

2045
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:15,000
Show me how loyal you are!

2046
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,700
The most loyal- The most loyal- The most loyal- Will take his mod plays.

2047
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:28,770
Then he can be with D-zone.

2048
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:29,610
Hahaha!

2049
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:33,590
Mod on mod crap!

2050
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:39,700
That's what you get!

2051
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,400
For trying to fight for one guy!

2052
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:48,970
That's right!

2053
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:51,590
Think again when you try to fight for one guy!

2054
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:00,270
Where the fuck am I going?

2055
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:05,370
Pretty near...

2056
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:05,690
There?

2057
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:11,110
Many guys should fight for the one guy!

2058
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:14,750
Oh shit!

2059
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:16,810
That's fine, I think- Yeah, I was gonna say.

2060
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:17,990
I knew I could tank that.

2061
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:22,950
Yeah, but there's- There's an upper too!

2062
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,990
There's an item!

2063
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:26,390
Yay, item!

2064
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:32,970
What's that over there?

2065
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:35,490
Is that another item?

2066
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:36,850
Behold, turn back!

2067
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:37,270
Okay.

2068
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:41,550
He fought the law and the law won!

2069
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:42,330
Exactly!

2070
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:48,450
We all need a rem- I need to make an example today!

2071
01:35:52,830 --> 01:36:00,850
Today, I make an example of someone that thought he was- He was- He was- Who big for the law, But he forgot- I am the law!

2072
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,300
He thought I didn't reach that.

2073
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:14,800
That's right.

2074
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,260
He chose the wrong day!

2075
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:22,040
No man, it is- It is that time of the- That's right!

2076
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:25,420
He chose the wrong day to fight against the law!

2077
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:27,460
Hah, hahahaha!

2078
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,880
If it was any other day!

2079
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:32,580
Nah,

2080
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,900
wording- This guy?

2081
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:48,380
Okay, but like... I thought there was another grace here.

2082
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,180
Where the fuck is the grace?

2083
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,440
Oh, it's on the right side?

2084
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:54,280
Like this right?

2085
01:36:58,540 --> 01:36:59,600
No, that's a dog.

2086
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:00,980
Wait, that's a dog.

2087
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:05,000
Oh, down to the right.

2088
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:07,340
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

2089
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,320
Thank you, thank you.

2090
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:15,920
If I hug the wall, you can't see me.

2091
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,500
Oh, he's sleeping.

2092
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:24,000
Me me me me me me me me me me me me me me.

2093
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,280
Me me me me me me me me me me me me me me.

2094
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:27,760
Okay.

2095
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,580
Don't calm down.

2096
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,040
Alright, nice.

2097
01:37:39,210 --> 01:37:40,470
Any final words?

2098
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:42,570
Silent break beat?

2099
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,070
Any final words?

2100
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:44,810
Don't think I forgot.

2101
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:47,150
Don't think I forgot.

2102
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:49,150
Just because I was trying to find the grace.

2103
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,940
Are the bloodstains these?

2104
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,020
A bird?

2105
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,960
He died to a fucking bird?

2106
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,040
Loser.

2107
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:09,180
Oh my god, there's more than one bird!

2108
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,460
Alright, there you go.

2109
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:15,820
Brother.

2110
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:22,720
Hey, what's that?

2111
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:24,360
Wait, that's a dragon.

2112
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,760
Oh my god, he did not die to one bird.

2113
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:30,820
Wait, where's the lever?

2114
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:36,900
Oh my god.

2115
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,160
Oh my god.

2116
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:44,390
Oh my god.

2117
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:45,450
Oh my god.

2118
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:47,690
Oh my god.

2119
01:38:47,690 --> 01:38:50,350
Oh my god.

2120
01:38:50,690 --> 01:38:52,370
Oh my god.

2121
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:53,810
Oh my god.

2122
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:55,170
Oh my god.

2123
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:55,650
Oh my god.

2124
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:55,730
Oh my god.

2125
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:55,870
Oh my god.

2126
01:38:55,990 --> 01:38:56,050
Oh my god.

2127
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:56,690
Oh my god.

2128
01:38:57,130 --> 01:38:57,390
Oh my god.

2129
01:38:59,270 --> 01:38:59,550
Oh my god.

2130
01:38:59,550 --> 01:38:59,870
Oh my god.

2131
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:01,590
Oh my god.

2132
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,510
Oh my god.

2133
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:06,950
D zone and I want you to time him out again.

2134
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:11,090
That's right.

2135
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:16,330
I'm gonna unban D zone and I want you to do it.

2136
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:17,870
I want you to do it yourself.

2137
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:20,210
That's fine.

2138
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:21,430
That's fine.

2139
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:22,310
This gives me time.

2140
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:24,670
That's evil.

2141
01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:28,370
That's right.

2142
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:30,050
No, that's good.

2143
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:30,590
I die.

2144
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:33,490
I can see.

2145
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:36,570
That's so evil.

2146
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:41,070
That's right.

2147
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:42,070
Alright, where is he?

2148
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:45,750
Alright, let me untie him out real quick, guys.

2149
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:49,070
Don't worry, I remember how to do this.

2150
01:39:51,010 --> 01:39:53,970
That's so messed up.

2151
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:57,390
That gives me plenty of time to do this.

2152
01:39:58,290 --> 01:39:59,730
Alright, let's see.

2153
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:03,470
Let me find your name real quick, Deezer.

2154
01:40:05,090 --> 01:40:06,690
So I can do this.

2155
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:08,450
Wait, where are you?

2156
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:10,730
Oh my god.

2157
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:12,450
Oh my god.

2158
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:15,610
That was a ring changer.

2159
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:19,250
Community moderation.

2160
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:21,710
Alright.

2161
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:24,450
Where is my...

2162
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:27,850
Where is my timeout section?

2163
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:28,290
Okay.

2164
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:29,630
How to un...

2165
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:34,610
How do I untime out someone in YouTube?

2166
01:40:35,090 --> 01:40:37,510
Okay, how do I undo a timeout?

2167
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:42,030
Oh, shit.

2168
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:45,130
There's no way to undo a timeout.

2169
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:46,430
They wouldn't show up.

2170
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:55,290
There's no way to undo a timeout.

2171
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:55,870
Alright.

2172
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,950
If I ever see him...

2173
01:40:58,950 --> 01:41:00,370
You're so lucky.

2174
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:02,890
You're so lucky.

2175
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:03,730
Alright.

2176
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:07,190
If I ever see...

2177
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:09,170
If we ever see him again...

2178
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:11,130
If I ever see him again...

2179
01:41:11,130 --> 01:41:12,670
Your job...

2180
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:14,370
Silent...

2181
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:17,230
Is to time him out another 24 hours.

2182
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:20,150
Say...

2183
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:22,730
YouTube does not support your...

2184
01:41:22,730 --> 01:41:23,130
Alright!

2185
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:23,410
No!

2186
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:24,190
I got someone!

2187
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:25,090
Alright!

2188
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:25,850
Where is he?

2189
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:27,550
Grass Spirit One!

2190
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:28,970
That's right!

2191
01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:31,510
That's right!

2192
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:32,330
That's right!

2193
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:33,710
You think...

2194
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:37,970
That's right!

2195
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:38,790
You!

2196
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,550
You!

2197
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:42,990
Alright!

2198
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:43,850
Do it!

2199
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:45,470
Do it!

2200
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:45,710
Do it!

2201
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:46,110
Break beat!

2202
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:48,510
To grass!

2203
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:49,950
Right now!

2204
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:50,730
I'm waiting.

2205
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:53,110
I'm waiting.

2206
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:57,410
I'll grab someone else.

2207
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:59,510
None shall be spared.

2208
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:01,050
That's right.

2209
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:01,630
Come on.

2210
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:03,330
Come on, BrickBeak.

2211
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:04,470
Do it.

2212
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:05,970
Do it.

2213
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:10,190
I'm going to get out of here.

2214
01:42:14,230 --> 01:42:14,990
Goodbye.

2215
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:18,430
There we go.

2216
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:19,370
Look at that.

2217
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:22,230
Things people do to keep their mind.

2218
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:25,710
Remember when you all stood up for a silent BrickBeak.

2219
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:27,650
Look how quick he did.

2220
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:30,810
Look how quick he was to turn on you.

2221
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:33,450
Look how quick it was.

2222
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:35,210
How could you.

2223
01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:37,570
You all fought for this man.

2224
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:42,130
And he instantly timed out someone after I told him to.

2225
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:45,390
You are a monster.

2226
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:48,150
You are the chosen one.

2227
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:53,390
Look at that.

2228
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:54,390
You fought for him.

2229
01:42:54,530 --> 01:42:56,810
And he instantly banned one of your people.

2230
01:42:58,590 --> 01:42:59,410
Remember that.

2231
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:01,810
The next time you try to fight for someone.

2232
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:06,950
He had to follow orders.

2233
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:11,710
Oh, shit.

2234
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:14,870
I need to grab my swords back.

2235
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,230
Wherever they are.

2236
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:17,810
Oh, shit.

2237
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:18,570
Where is it?

2238
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:19,350
Are they anyway?

2239
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:21,890
Oh, there it is.

2240
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:25,690
We live in a house of lies.

2241
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:28,670
Grass always grows back.

2242
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:30,730
Mr. Broken Bot.

2243
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:32,650
Thank you for the super chat.

2244
01:43:32,970 --> 01:43:33,110
Thank you.

2245
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:33,910
Thank you.

2246
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:35,330
That's right.

2247
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:38,150
What did you learn today, chat?

2248
01:43:39,210 --> 01:43:41,150
Never trust anybody.

2249
01:43:45,290 --> 01:43:47,990
Not even the law is there for you.

2250
01:43:50,210 --> 01:43:51,450
Oh my god.

2251
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:52,870
Can I run past this guy?

2252
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:58,790
Toki, we learned today that Toki is evil.

2253
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:00,410
What the fuck did I do?

2254
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:03,590
I just showed you the truth.

2255
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:09,570
The fight against evil.

2256
01:44:12,910 --> 01:44:13,750
You know what?

2257
01:44:13,870 --> 01:44:14,650
Toki, you too.

2258
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:16,210
You too.

2259
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:19,530
I want you to time out.

2260
01:44:24,070 --> 01:44:24,810
That's right.

2261
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:26,090
I'm getting you involved too.

2262
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:28,010
Don't think you're innocent.

2263
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:30,070
I'm covering your hands with blood.

2264
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:32,190
You too.

2265
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:33,930
You too will have your hands covered in blood.

2266
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:38,890
Toki, what the hell?

2267
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:42,090
No one's safe.

2268
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:46,430
Leave him out of this.

2269
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:48,730
Not my crochet.

2270
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:50,470
How could he?

2271
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:57,850
Everyone's getting their blood dirty today.

2272
01:45:01,030 --> 01:45:02,230
No one is safe.

2273
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:05,950
You thought these mods were one of you.

2274
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:07,990
They're not one of you.

2275
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:12,970
Don't betray you the moment I tell them to.

2276
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:16,510
So think that again when you try to stand up for them.

2277
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:22,330
You won't get away with this Toki.

2278
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:28,270
Alright, let's fight this guy.

2279
01:45:30,690 --> 01:45:32,210
Okay, we gotta get rid of him.

2280
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:33,010
Oh my god!

2281
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:34,270
Oh my god!

2282
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:39,080
It's fine.

2283
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:41,960
It is not fine.

2284
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:46,650
Okay.

2285
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:50,820
It's okay.

2286
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:51,580
It's okay.

2287
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:51,880
It's not okay.

2288
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:52,720
It's...

2289
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:57,080
We were so far away!

2290
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,880
We're so far away.

2291
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:06,220
If Toki is evil, I don't wanna be good.

2292
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,000
Actually, thank you for the super chat.

2293
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:09,700
Who said that?

2294
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:11,480
That's what you get?

2295
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,300
Alright, that's it.

2296
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,840
You see who I'm seeing, Kroki?

2297
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:21,200
Do it.

2298
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,120
Do it.

2299
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:29,560
It's time to time him out.

2300
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:30,700
Come on.

2301
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,480
Do it, Kroki.

2302
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,240
Leave him alone!

2303
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,790
When will she stop?

2304
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:43,110
Like 50 people.

2305
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:43,470
Alright.

2306
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:47,130
I remember your name.

2307
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:47,950
Don't think you...

2308
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:48,270
Oh!

2309
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:49,390
Oh!

2310
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:50,610
Nice, alright.

2311
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:53,350
That's right.

2312
01:46:53,970 --> 01:46:54,770
Look at that.

2313
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:56,630
I told you.

2314
01:46:57,130 --> 01:46:58,350
No one is safe.

2315
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:01,690
None of these mods are there for you.

2316
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:01,750
Thank you.

2317
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:06,190
This is abuse.

2318
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:10,950
Alright.

2319
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:11,730
Let's figure out.

2320
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:12,170
Okay.

2321
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:13,710
We gotta run past all of this again.

2322
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:18,900
Alright.

2323
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:20,980
Should I do this again?

2324
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:23,100
Alright.

2325
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:23,800
One more.

2326
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,200
Silently!

2327
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:26,640
Okay.

2328
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,900
I'm not reading all that.

2329
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,320
You know what to do.

2330
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,620
My next death.

2331
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:34,720
My next death.

2332
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:36,460
It's your turn.

2333
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,000
It'll be your turn next.

2334
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,720
Alright.

2335
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:47,640
Here I go.

2336
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:56,420
Women doji is scary.

2337
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:00,540
You picked the wrong day.

2338
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:04,120
Oh no.

2339
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:05,520
Alright.

2340
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:12,200
Okay.

2341
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:13,540
Let's just get him out of the way first.

2342
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:14,940
Fuck this guy in particular.

2343
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,220
Oh shit.

2344
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:19,240
Oh wait.

2345
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:19,840
They're all sleeping.

2346
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:20,420
Okay.

2347
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,920
Maybe I shouldn't.

2348
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,300
I didn't even realize they were all sleeping.

2349
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:28,330
Alright.

2350
01:48:28,490 --> 01:48:29,090
Let's get him out.

2351
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,470
And then...

2352
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:31,190
Oh shit.

2353
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:32,170
What the fuck?

2354
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:35,610
I don't remember all of these guys from before.

2355
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:38,290
Just...

2356
01:48:38,290 --> 01:48:38,410
Okay.

2357
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:39,450
Let's get him...

2358
01:48:39,450 --> 01:48:40,610
I'm gonna use my...

2359
01:48:40,610 --> 01:48:41,670
Magic here.

2360
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:45,410
And then I can go up here.

2361
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:49,660
Okay.

2362
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:50,080
That's...

2363
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:50,960
Oh my god.

2364
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,980
I didn't realize it was a fucking boomerang.

2365
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,060
Get out of here.

2366
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:59,100
And then...

2367
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,020
Then I'll pick this up.

2368
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:08,320
Does anyone wanna volunteer?

2369
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:10,880
I will not choose you.

2370
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:13,820
Jumping ahead?

2371
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:13,900
Then?

2372
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:17,600
That...

2373
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:18,260
That's a lie.

2374
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:20,440
That's a lie.

2375
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:21,300
Okay.

2376
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:23,760
Is it actually?

2377
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:27,300
No, that's like a minibus, right?

2378
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:31,100
Like...

2379
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:31,980
Where's the grace?

2380
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:34,960
No, it's true.

2381
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:36,340
But where's the grace though?

2382
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,040
That's the thing.

2383
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:40,980
Yeah, but I wanna find the grace.

2384
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:48,870
Nearby?

2385
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:49,490
Okay.

2386
01:49:51,170 --> 01:49:51,650
Inside.

2387
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:52,530
Okay, it's in here.

2388
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:53,090
Okay.

2389
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:56,590
I just gotta figure out how to fucking fight this.

2390
01:49:59,210 --> 01:50:00,850
I'm gonna fight this guy first.

2391
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,170
I just wanna get him out of here.

2392
01:50:06,370 --> 01:50:07,810
So then I can fight this guy.

2393
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,640
Alright, nice.

2394
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:14,160
Okay, he's dead too.

2395
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:17,720
Alright.

2396
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,540
This has to be a grace here.

2397
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:26,700
Okay, that's fine.

2398
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:30,660
Oh my god.

2399
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:32,420
No!

2400
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:34,160
That's fine.

2401
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:37,320
Woo!

2402
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:38,760
Not fine, not fine.

2403
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:39,680
I don't know why I didn't heal.

2404
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,340
Are you serious?

2405
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:46,660
Okay, nice.

2406
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:49,700
Okay, nice.

2407
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:50,200
Oh, fuck.

2408
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:51,620
Okay, I should not have tanked that.

2409
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:52,740
But...

2410
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,160
I can win this.

2411
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:54,740
Okay, nice.

2412
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,120
I knew I could win that.

2413
01:50:57,180 --> 01:50:58,880
I knew I could win if I tank it.

2414
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:03,840
Ooh.

2415
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:09,390
Nice, there is a grace here.

2416
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:11,610
Alright.

2417
01:51:13,230 --> 01:51:14,010
Because I found it.

2418
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:14,270
Oh, wait.

2419
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:14,950
I can lull up.

2420
01:51:15,110 --> 01:51:15,390
Nice.

2421
01:51:16,430 --> 01:51:18,450
I'm gonna go get the...

2422
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:20,670
figure, actually.

2423
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:21,650
Alright.

2424
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:24,190
Since I have a grace, we can do the execution now.

2425
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:30,750
Alright.

2426
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:32,110
Alright.

2427
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:32,970
Who...

2428
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:34,170
Hmm.

2429
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:36,870
It is time.

2430
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:41,870
That's one hell of a sentence.

2431
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:43,450
Alright.

2432
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:44,550
Let's see it.

2433
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:46,650
Women aren't that scary.

2434
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:49,110
Women under the blood moon.

2435
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:50,630
Solid snake.

2436
01:51:50,790 --> 01:51:52,050
Thank you in the super chat.

2437
01:51:52,190 --> 01:51:52,490
Thank you.

2438
01:51:52,650 --> 01:51:53,250
Thank you.

2439
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:54,190
Alright.

2440
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:55,910
Scatter.

2441
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:57,650
Alright, let's see.

2442
01:51:57,730 --> 01:51:58,790
I'm scrolling up.

2443
01:52:03,770 --> 01:52:06,050
We stand as one.

2444
01:52:09,630 --> 01:52:10,470
Let's see.

2445
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:11,330
Hmm.

2446
01:52:14,990 --> 01:52:15,830
Behind you.

2447
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:16,950
Rob span.

2448
01:52:17,390 --> 01:52:17,890
Grace is on.

2449
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:19,630
Okay, people are saying good things.

2450
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:20,150
You know?

2451
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:21,210
Look at that.

2452
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:21,530
See?

2453
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:23,770
Executing people live on stream.

2454
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:24,910
Could be a good thing.

2455
01:52:26,830 --> 01:52:27,950
Look at that.

2456
01:52:28,690 --> 01:52:29,030
Look at that.

2457
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:31,270
Everyone is so nice to me now in chat.

2458
01:52:31,570 --> 01:52:31,790
Wow.

2459
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:32,710
Oh.

2460
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:38,630
Everyone is so nice to me now.

2461
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:45,830
Neat.

2462
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,090
Yeah, isn't that neat?

2463
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:48,410
Isn't that...

2464
01:52:48,410 --> 01:52:49,950
I fear nothing.

2465
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:50,870
Alright.

2466
01:52:51,870 --> 01:52:52,310
You know what?

2467
01:52:52,530 --> 01:52:52,970
Silently.

2468
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:53,790
Pick one.

2469
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:55,090
Pick one.

2470
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:56,470
Whichever one you want.

2471
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:58,630
You all need to...

2472
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:00,950
You all gotta have blood on your hands.

2473
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:02,070
Pick one.

2474
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:06,090
Time out one person of your choosing.

2475
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:07,410
Don't worry.

2476
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:08,890
I will know when you did it.

2477
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:10,790
You can't get us.

2478
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:11,310
Yeah.

2479
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:11,770
Yeah.

2480
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:12,350
Pick one.

2481
01:53:12,490 --> 01:53:13,430
It's your turn.

2482
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:14,670
It's all...

2483
01:53:14,670 --> 01:53:16,450
The responsibility is on your hands.

2484
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:17,490
Their blood...

2485
01:53:17,490 --> 01:53:19,230
Is on your hands too.

2486
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:20,650
Because I didn't pick the person.

2487
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:21,850
You did.

2488
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:26,990
It's okay.

2489
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:28,450
Just pick me.

2490
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:38,530
Who did you pick?

2491
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:39,910
Oh.

2492
01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:42,610
Goodbye, Orca.

2493
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,530
Goodbye.

2494
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,510
Orca has been slain.

2495
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:47,630
Alright.

2496
01:53:47,890 --> 01:53:48,630
Let's move on.

2497
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:49,750
Let's move.

2498
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:53,910
I didn't pick it.

2499
01:53:54,130 --> 01:53:55,390
I didn't pick anybody.

2500
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:58,910
Now all the mods have blood on their hands.

2501
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,080
Remember.

2502
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:07,120
This was someone you guys protected.

2503
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:08,240
At one point.

2504
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:11,480
What lesson did we learn today, chat?

2505
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,820
Try parrying?

2506
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:15,800
Wait.

2507
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:16,500
Is he a...

2508
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:16,900
Wait.

2509
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:18,940
Is he like...

2510
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:20,080
Wait.

2511
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,920
Is he like...

2512
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:23,620
Wait a minute.

2513
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:24,360
I didn't level up.

2514
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:26,660
Wait a minute.

2515
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:28,840
Wait a minute.

2516
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,720
I didn't level up.

2517
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:31,800
I just realized.

2518
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:38,970
Alright.

2519
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:39,430
Give me a sec.

2520
01:54:40,410 --> 01:54:40,790
Hello.

2521
01:54:41,170 --> 01:54:41,870
Where is it?

2522
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:56,750
Its my soul.

2523
01:54:57,170 --> 01:54:59,130
Is my soul like...

2524
01:54:59,130 --> 01:55:00,670
Where is it?

2525
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:03,430
Wait.

2526
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:04,110
Where is my...

2527
01:55:04,110 --> 01:55:04,890
Oh there it is?

2528
01:55:07,890 --> 01:55:10,150
Okay, I can still level up.

2529
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:11,270
I can still level up.

2530
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:12,230
It's fine.

2531
01:55:12,490 --> 01:55:13,850
I can still level up.

2532
01:55:14,290 --> 01:55:14,790
I agree.

2533
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:19,330
It's fine.

2534
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:23,610
We still have... we can still level up.

2535
01:55:24,130 --> 01:55:26,670
It's Asian thinking with a super sickest thing.

2536
01:55:27,130 --> 01:55:27,330
Thank you.

2537
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:32,430
Karma swift like lightning and just as shocking.

2538
01:55:33,110 --> 01:55:34,630
Apoc, thank you in the super chat.

2539
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:35,050
Thank you.

2540
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:35,630
Thank you.

2541
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:38,290
Star Ace, thank you in the super chat.

2542
01:55:38,350 --> 01:55:38,550
Thank you.

2543
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:39,070
Thank you.

2544
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:41,510
Draco is the age of Doki is over.

2545
01:55:41,790 --> 01:55:43,930
No more false prophets.

2546
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:47,610
Follow me and you'll never be deceived again.

2547
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:57,320
Wow, guys.

2548
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:58,280
Did you guys hear something?

2549
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,460
Did you guys...

2550
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:02,540
Did you guys hear something?

2551
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:14,320
Give me a sec... Let me...

2552
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:16,030
Also...

2553
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:17,740
Do this real quick.

2554
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:18,480
Let me...

2555
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:24,440
Wow!

2556
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,720
Just the wind.

2557
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,820
Just...

2558
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:30,270
Just...

2559
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:32,280
Just the wind.

2560
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:32,540
The wind.

2561
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:36,540
It was a deafening process.

2562
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:37,980
Nothing happened.

2563
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:41,240
I have to kill him?

2564
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:42,320
Oh my...

2565
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,000
Just the wind.

2566
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:48,140
Just the wind.

2567
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:48,780
Say no.

2568
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:50,020
It's tyranny.

2569
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:57,020
All you hear is me.

2570
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,740
It's just a wind.

2571
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:00,800
Only Doki.

2572
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,240
Do I have to kill him?

2573
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,060
I feel like I don't have to.

2574
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:10,180
Damn, this hurricane is so loud.

2575
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:10,760
Guys.

2576
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:11,280
Wow.

2577
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,600
Oh, he's optional?

2578
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:23,500
Okay.

2579
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:24,160
That's good to know.

2580
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:24,620
I'm running.

2581
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:40,880
Alright.

2582
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:43,040
Let's grab the stuff and leave.

2583
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:52,590
Oh, killing him is easy...

2584
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:53,630
Would make it easier?

2585
01:57:53,830 --> 01:57:54,030
Alright.

2586
01:57:54,630 --> 01:57:56,650
If killing him would make it easy, I'll do it.

2587
01:57:59,630 --> 01:58:01,770
I don't remember how to kill these guys.

2588
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:02,290
I...

2589
01:58:02,290 --> 01:58:03,510
I swear to...

2590
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:03,710
Okay.

2591
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:04,670
Does he respawn though?

2592
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:05,350
If I kill him?

2593
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:07,470
Does he respawn?

2594
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:13,910
I hope you lose all your...

2595
01:58:14,270 --> 01:58:15,550
You know what's funny?

2596
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:19,050
Star was only timed out for 10 seconds.

2597
01:58:19,290 --> 01:58:20,250
But I don't see...

2598
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,730
He's scared now.

2599
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:26,710
Star, come on.

2600
01:58:26,870 --> 01:58:27,750
Speak up, Star.

2601
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:29,030
Come on.

2602
01:58:29,170 --> 01:58:29,890
You were only gone.

2603
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:32,110
It was only a 10 second time out.

2604
01:58:33,030 --> 01:58:35,390
Why are you so scared, Star?

2605
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:36,290
What?

2606
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:43,230
Star, dude.

2607
01:58:43,730 --> 01:58:45,470
You were the wrong time.

2608
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:47,510
Oh, he's back.

2609
01:58:47,950 --> 01:58:49,490
Oh, he's back, guys.

2610
01:58:49,490 --> 01:58:49,970
Please.

2611
01:58:55,250 --> 01:58:57,030
Oh, you were scared.

2612
01:58:58,570 --> 01:59:01,490
The psychological warfare.

2613
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:04,390
Jesus Christ!

2614
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:07,350
Okay, this guy is hard.

2615
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:18,760
She got the media monopoly.

2616
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:25,140
Alright, it's fine.

2617
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,420
I can do this.

2618
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:29,560
Jingle, jingle.

2619
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:31,700
Jingle.

2620
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,260
The tension in this room.

2621
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:37,740
Jingle, jingle.

2622
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:44,900
Alright, we gotta grab her.

2623
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:48,940
Actually, I don't really care too much about these runes because they're like...

2624
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,520
Jesus Christ!

2625
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:55,080
He does so much damage.

2626
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:01,570
Okay, I actually have to...

2627
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:10,890
God damn it!

2628
02:00:10,890 --> 02:00:11,630
You know what?

2629
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:13,370
Yeah, AK is not worth it.

2630
02:00:13,490 --> 02:00:14,050
I'm just gonna...

2631
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:18,170
AK is definitely not worth it.

2632
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:21,110
Sweet justice.

2633
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:29,030
Alright.

2634
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:31,470
Yeah, I'm gonna skip it.

2635
02:00:34,030 --> 02:00:35,590
Is it actually worth it?

2636
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:37,210
Okay.

2637
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:45,130
Guys, I know like I executed a lot of you, but like it's time to do the streamer...

2638
02:00:48,070 --> 02:00:48,910
Guys, come on.

2639
02:00:49,110 --> 02:00:49,530
Guys, come on.

2640
02:00:49,530 --> 02:00:50,430
It's time for the...

2641
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:52,570
It's time for the streamer field, guys.

2642
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:53,530
It's...

2643
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:54,410
It's...

2644
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:54,570
It's time.

2645
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:56,890
It's...

2646
02:00:59,310 --> 02:01:00,270
It's time for the streamer field.

2647
02:01:00,270 --> 02:01:00,570
Come on, guys.

2648
02:01:03,830 --> 02:01:04,710
No help.

2649
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:09,370
Come on, this entire field requires...

2650
02:01:09,890 --> 02:01:10,150
Teamwork.

2651
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:11,190
We're a team, guys.

2652
02:01:11,370 --> 02:01:11,750
We're a team.

2653
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:13,490
We're a team, guys.

2654
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:15,410
What did you say?

2655
02:01:15,530 --> 02:01:16,850
The wind is too loud.

2656
02:01:20,050 --> 02:01:21,170
Oh, fuck.

2657
02:01:21,950 --> 02:01:22,710
Oh, fuck.

2658
02:01:22,710 --> 02:01:24,310
Where the fuck let this horse be fire?

2659
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:33,450
Jesus Christ, he has so much HP.

2660
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:38,550
After the execution, morale is low.

2661
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:39,310
Oh, no.

2662
02:01:39,310 --> 02:01:40,550
Oh, no.

2663
02:01:51,690 --> 02:01:52,450
Don't worry.

2664
02:01:52,590 --> 02:01:54,670
I know what to do to raise morale, guys.

2665
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:55,790
Guys.

2666
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:56,170
Guys.

2667
02:01:56,350 --> 02:01:57,230
I know what to do.

2668
02:01:57,650 --> 02:01:59,030
To raise morale.

2669
02:01:59,450 --> 02:01:59,910
I...

2670
02:02:02,050 --> 02:02:02,650
Guys.

2671
02:02:02,990 --> 02:02:03,390
It's okay.

2672
02:02:03,910 --> 02:02:04,670
Don't worry.

2673
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:07,190
I know morale is very low right now.

2674
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:09,570
But I know exactly what to do.

2675
02:02:10,150 --> 02:02:10,550
I...

2676
02:02:17,190 --> 02:02:19,330
I know what to do.

2677
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:21,430
To raise all your morale.

2678
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:22,890
Alright.

2679
02:02:23,130 --> 02:02:24,030
Where is it here?

2680
02:02:27,490 --> 02:02:29,030
It works every time.

2681
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:32,990
It works 100% of the time.

2682
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,220
But I'll add something extra.

2683
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:44,720
For the occasion.

2684
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:56,210
For the special occasion.

2685
02:02:56,210 --> 02:02:56,370
For the special occasion.

2686
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:07,290
There we go.

2687
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:09,370
There we go.

2688
02:03:09,610 --> 02:03:10,090
Now...

2689
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:15,010
Alright, dragoons.

2690
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:16,890
Here are the messages.

2691
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:18,750
Here are the...

2692
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:20,710
We busted.

2693
02:03:23,030 --> 02:03:24,550
First off...

2694
02:03:26,290 --> 02:03:27,590
Here we go.

2695
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:28,410
Head.

2696
02:03:28,650 --> 02:03:29,150
Right here.

2697
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:29,610
Alright.

2698
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:31,810
Right here.

2699
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:32,610
Alright.

2700
02:03:32,610 --> 02:03:33,570
Hold the line.

2701
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:34,690
Alright.

2702
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:35,950
And then...

2703
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:36,130
Alright.

2704
02:03:36,190 --> 02:03:37,090
Here's another one.

2705
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:37,590
Alright.

2706
02:03:37,990 --> 02:03:39,130
All is forgiven, right?

2707
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:41,130
Um...

2708
02:03:41,130 --> 02:03:41,410
No.

2709
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:43,870
You monster.

2710
02:03:44,530 --> 02:03:45,190
Alright.

2711
02:03:47,370 --> 02:03:48,750
Head required.

2712
02:03:49,150 --> 02:03:49,670
A head.

2713
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:50,590
Alright.

2714
02:03:50,590 --> 02:03:52,230
Now dragoons.

2715
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:53,970
We all know what to do now.

2716
02:03:54,270 --> 02:03:54,390
Right?

2717
02:03:55,050 --> 02:03:56,630
What does a good dragoon do?

2718
02:03:56,890 --> 02:03:57,090
Guys.

2719
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:57,770
What does...

2720
02:04:01,370 --> 02:04:02,570
We appraise...

2721
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:03,970
My messages.

2722
02:04:05,290 --> 02:04:05,890
Okay?

2723
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:08,110
Is that clear drag?

2724
02:04:08,350 --> 02:04:09,470
You appraise...

2725
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:10,830
Doki's messages.

2726
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:11,930
Right here.

2727
02:04:11,930 --> 02:04:12,010
Where?

2728
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:13,950
Or I take this away.

2729
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:14,930
That's right.

2730
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:16,870
That's right.

2731
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:21,370
That's right.

2732
02:04:21,370 --> 02:04:21,390
That's right.

2733
02:04:21,550 --> 02:04:22,470
We're clear now.

2734
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:23,390
We're...

2735
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:24,810
We're clear.

2736
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:31,550
That's right.

2737
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:33,290
We understand now.

2738
02:04:34,290 --> 02:04:35,770
We understand.

2739
02:04:37,370 --> 02:04:38,410
That's good.

2740
02:04:38,630 --> 02:04:39,170
That's good.

2741
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:41,510
That's good.

2742
02:04:44,110 --> 02:04:46,510
I'm glad we all have an understanding.

2743
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:53,240
Brother!

2744
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,560
Don't let this heretic get to you!

2745
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,440
Brother!

2746
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:03,600
Just like my Warhammer.

2747
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:17,710
I'm sorry, y'all.

2748
02:05:17,710 --> 02:05:19,150
I have to go siren, y'all.

2749
02:05:23,970 --> 02:05:24,750
Oh, shit!

2750
02:05:25,310 --> 02:05:27,470
Guys, guys, where are my appraisers?

2751
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:30,150
Guys, guys, where...

2752
02:05:30,150 --> 02:05:34,670
Where were my appraisals, guys?

2753
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:44,450
And you know, Mehdi is out here ready to prize despite having been tagged out.

2754
02:05:44,610 --> 02:05:48,630
What a loyal, weak-willed Dragoo.

2755
02:05:55,610 --> 02:05:56,210
Alright.

2756
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:58,630
It's okay, it's just...

2757
02:05:58,630 --> 02:06:00,550
The wind was just too loud, right?

2758
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:05,450
The wind was just too loud, right, guys?

2759
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:13,150
Oh, shit.

2760
02:06:13,310 --> 02:06:14,490
Okay, let's just...

2761
02:06:14,490 --> 02:06:15,310
I'm gonna...

2762
02:06:15,310 --> 02:06:15,830
Oh, my God.

2763
02:06:16,030 --> 02:06:16,790
Oh, my...

2764
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:17,030
Nice.

2765
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:17,670
Alright, nice.

2766
02:06:17,890 --> 02:06:18,050
Okay.

2767
02:06:21,010 --> 02:06:21,670
Oh, yeah.

2768
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:23,130
I knew...

2769
02:06:23,130 --> 02:06:24,410
I knew what to do.

2770
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:28,990
Okay, it's good to know.

2771
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:32,190
Shit.

2772
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:38,930
Okay, nice lead.

2773
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:41,950
Alright.

2774
02:06:44,230 --> 02:06:45,230
Don't upgrade.

2775
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:46,130
It's too late.

2776
02:06:47,970 --> 02:06:49,410
I always have a backup.

2777
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:51,810
I told you I know what to do to raise morale.

2778
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:53,990
I told you.

2779
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:02,590
Oh, shit.

2780
02:07:04,210 --> 02:07:05,270
Okay, that's fine.

2781
02:07:08,490 --> 02:07:08,670
Okay.

2782
02:07:10,190 --> 02:07:11,690
Trying to focus right now.

2783
02:07:15,250 --> 02:07:15,810
Nice.

2784
02:07:25,590 --> 02:07:27,070
It's definitely raised.

2785
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:30,050
I told you guys, I know exactly what to do.

2786
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:34,150
Don't worry.

2787
02:07:34,490 --> 02:07:36,770
Man, there's always a backup plan.

2788
02:07:37,910 --> 02:07:40,790
Holy fuck, what the fuck?

2789
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:42,830
This guy does so much.

2790
02:07:49,370 --> 02:07:54,030
I'm like, sorry I'm knowing a pattern, but also, Jesus Christ.

2791
02:08:01,970 --> 02:08:02,690
Okay.

2792
02:08:06,310 --> 02:08:06,890
Okay.

2793
02:08:07,470 --> 02:08:08,610
And then one hit here.

2794
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:14,390
And then I have to do that.

2795
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:15,950
And then that here.

2796
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:18,330
And then recharge.

2797
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:19,330
And then...

2798
02:08:20,870 --> 02:08:22,970
Oh my god, I should have to focus so much.

2799
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:26,450
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2800
02:08:26,570 --> 02:08:26,770
Fuck.

2801
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:30,490
Okay, that's fine.

2802
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:32,870
I have one more heal.

2803
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:38,170
Shit.

2804
02:08:38,570 --> 02:08:39,650
I didn't think he'd do that.

2805
02:08:41,250 --> 02:08:42,030
God damn it.

2806
02:08:44,610 --> 02:08:45,570
Are you serious?

2807
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:49,930
Are you serious?

2808
02:08:50,070 --> 02:08:50,830
That hits me?

2809
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:53,150
Oh no, I don't think I'm winning this.

2810
02:08:54,210 --> 02:08:55,490
I'm not winning this.

2811
02:08:55,650 --> 02:08:55,910
No!

2812
02:08:56,490 --> 02:08:57,350
So close!

2813
02:08:58,090 --> 02:08:59,510
I'm so close!

2814
02:09:02,490 --> 02:09:03,690
All hail Doki.

2815
02:09:03,950 --> 02:09:06,830
She speaks and we obey.

2816
02:09:07,790 --> 02:09:08,510
Ramona.

2817
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:10,430
Thank you for the super chat.

2818
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:10,990
Thank you.

2819
02:09:11,170 --> 02:09:11,630
Thank you.

2820
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:14,030
Doki uses Jingle Jangle.

2821
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:15,910
It's super effective.

2822
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:18,050
And thank you for the super chat.

2823
02:09:18,210 --> 02:09:18,530
Thank you.

2824
02:09:18,670 --> 02:09:19,210
Thank you.

2825
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:20,630
It's alright guys.

2826
02:09:20,870 --> 02:09:22,570
I raised morale in Doki Nation.

2827
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:26,050
In the Dragoon community, morale has been raised.

2828
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:40,110
I told you guys I know what to do.

2829
02:09:40,250 --> 02:09:41,650
I told you.

2830
02:09:51,550 --> 02:09:52,070
Alright.

2831
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:58,600
Nice.

2832
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:00,080
I have to bleed out.

2833
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:00,500
No!

2834
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:02,600
No!

2835
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:02,960
No!

2836
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:06,500
It won't work on me.

2837
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:08,240
Somehow, yes.

2838
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:14,260
Alright.

2839
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:18,260
The greed.

2840
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:19,840
I greed it too much.

2841
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:21,660
I was waiting.

2842
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:24,440
Your false tricks won't work on me.

2843
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:26,000
You tyrant bird.

2844
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,520
I control the media.

2845
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:28,860
It's over for all of you.

2846
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:29,620
It's...

2847
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:34,460
Jingle Jangle.

2848
02:10:47,220 --> 02:10:48,020
Oh my god.

2849
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:48,720
I missed that.

2850
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:51,360
I don't really mind losing.

2851
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,420
Yeah, I'm not gonna pick up the runes.

2852
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:55,320
Like, I don't care about the runes enough.

2853
02:10:58,600 --> 02:10:59,080
Oh!

2854
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:00,440
I greed it!

2855
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:04,180
Can we appraise the sentinel?

2856
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:10,980
Jingle Jangle!

2857
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:12,980
Okay.

2858
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:13,620
Wait.

2859
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:14,460
Alright.

2860
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:15,060
Don't worry.

2861
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:15,620
I'll add one more.

2862
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:23,950
Here we go.

2863
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:27,830
For the one siren.

2864
02:11:28,410 --> 02:11:29,090
Still...

2865
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:30,930
For the true warriors out there.

2866
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:40,450
Alright.

2867
02:11:42,670 --> 02:11:44,050
Hold the light.

2868
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:55,800
Okay, I got...

2869
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:56,880
I'm gonna try and focus.

2870
02:11:57,480 --> 02:11:58,360
Alright, I'm locking in.

2871
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:00,820
This guy, I actually have to focus.

2872
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:01,960
I can't fuck around.

2873
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:07,160
I have a rebellion right now, so I can't...

2874
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:09,020
My streamer build is not as effective.

2875
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:13,880
There's a rebellion going on.

2876
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:15,520
So...

2877
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:18,540
My usual build is not as effective.

2878
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:19,620
But don't worry.

2879
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:20,960
Don't worry.

2880
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:21,960
It'll be fine.

2881
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:27,100
Some dragoons are having a strike right now.

2882
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:29,440
But don't worry, I can fix that soon.

2883
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:38,760
Alright.

2884
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:39,160
Oh shit.

2885
02:12:39,660 --> 02:12:39,980
Okay.

2886
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:42,800
Okay, nice.

2887
02:12:47,470 --> 02:12:48,070
Alright.

2888
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:51,750
Oh my, that's fine.

2889
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:53,850
That's okay.

2890
02:12:55,590 --> 02:12:56,410
That's okay.

2891
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:01,340
I have to heal.

2892
02:13:01,620 --> 02:13:02,760
I knew I was gonna get hit.

2893
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:06,220
Are you serious?

2894
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:08,200
Oh, I didn't know where to roll.

2895
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:10,280
I...

2896
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:11,520
Okay, you got me.

2897
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:13,920
I'm sorry, my queen, for my past transgression.

2898
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:15,980
You have my full support.

2899
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:16,640
Look for it.

2900
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:21,680
Alright, guys.

2901
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:22,460
Look.

2902
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,120
Look, I'm gonna say it.

2903
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:35,100
If you want me...

2904
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:37,120
To bring it back...

2905
02:13:39,830 --> 02:13:41,470
Doesn't come for free.

2906
02:13:42,250 --> 02:13:44,570
So stop your foolish rebellion.

2907
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:46,800
Or there will be no more...

2908
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:48,350
Jingle jangle.

2909
02:13:51,510 --> 02:13:52,290
Traded.

2910
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:58,310
It's time to stop your rebellion.

2911
02:13:59,110 --> 02:14:00,790
Unless you want...

2912
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:03,750
Unless there's no more jingle jangle.

2913
02:14:04,210 --> 02:14:05,790
You monster.

2914
02:14:06,710 --> 02:14:08,290
Come on, where's my appraisal?

2915
02:14:08,530 --> 02:14:11,010
Give me one appraisal, so I know we all agree.

2916
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:12,670
Come on.

2917
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:16,330
Give me that one appraisal, so I know we're all on the same...

2918
02:14:16,330 --> 02:14:17,070
That's right.

2919
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:19,490
That's right.

2920
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:29,410
I was not here.

2921
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:30,270
Bro.

2922
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:34,270
Alright.

2923
02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:35,590
We're all on the same page.

2924
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:36,450
That's good to know.

2925
02:14:37,390 --> 02:14:39,370
I'm glad we're all on the same page, though.

2926
02:14:42,530 --> 02:14:42,810
Good.

2927
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:43,550
Good.

2928
02:14:44,290 --> 02:14:46,610
We all know.

2929
02:14:46,610 --> 02:14:46,690
No.

2930
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:52,720
Nice.

2931
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:53,040
Okay.

2932
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:57,020
Okay, I just need to heal here.

2933
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:01,200
Alright.

2934
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:06,120
Bro, this guy is so fucking hard.

2935
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:06,800
Jesus Christ.

2936
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:12,660
Oh, I thought...

2937
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:14,200
Oh my god, I thought he was gonna use the...

2938
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:15,520
Lighting, but...

2939
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:15,980
Oh shit.

2940
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:17,940
No!

2941
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:20,300
That hit does so much damage!

2942
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:21,480
What?!

2943
02:15:25,430 --> 02:15:27,750
That did so much damage!

2944
02:15:28,110 --> 02:15:28,930
Oh my god.

2945
02:15:29,170 --> 02:15:30,070
I did not expect that.

2946
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:33,230
Alright.

2947
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:36,190
Deserve.

2948
02:15:45,330 --> 02:15:47,450
I'm always loyal, Doki.

2949
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:51,710
I served you in the old wars, and I'll serve again.

2950
02:15:52,250 --> 02:15:54,050
Raxi, thank you for the super chat.

2951
02:15:54,230 --> 02:15:55,110
Thank you.

2952
02:15:57,470 --> 02:15:59,010
I know I can like...

2953
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:01,150
Eh.

2954
02:16:03,850 --> 02:16:05,250
I know I can...

2955
02:16:07,870 --> 02:16:08,390
What?!

2956
02:16:08,910 --> 02:16:09,650
Okay, never mind.

2957
02:16:09,950 --> 02:16:10,710
Apparently not.

2958
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:15,590
I was gonna say, I know I can like, dodge that, but...

2959
02:16:15,590 --> 02:16:16,290
Eh?

2960
02:16:19,030 --> 02:16:20,070
Jesus Christ!

2961
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:27,740
Are you serious?!

2962
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:27,920
Are you serious?!

2963
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:28,700
What?!

2964
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:32,440
Eh.

2965
02:16:36,610 --> 02:16:38,550
I actually have to full focus here.

2966
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:43,760
Oh my god.

2967
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:44,840
Okay.

2968
02:16:45,480 --> 02:16:45,880
Got heal.

2969
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:47,920
Nice.

2970
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:51,300
Eh.

2971
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:53,020
Okay.

2972
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:54,540
I need to like, not be too greedy too.

2973
02:16:57,100 --> 02:16:57,560
Okay.

2974
02:17:01,140 --> 02:17:01,600
What?!

2975
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:01,920
That...

2976
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:03,240
That hits me?!

2977
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:04,180
That should not have hit me.

2978
02:17:05,140 --> 02:17:05,600
That...

2979
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:07,400
That should not have hit me!

2980
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:08,680
Are you serious?!

2981
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:10,220
I was doing...

2982
02:17:10,220 --> 02:17:10,420
I was doing...

2983
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:11,280
My dodges were...

2984
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:11,940
So good!

2985
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:15,420
My dodges were so good!

2986
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:15,940
Aww!

2987
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:19,260
Those...

2988
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:21,300
Those were some good dodges too.

2989
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:23,240
Okay.

2990
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:25,040
Alright, I'm full focusing for this.

2991
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:27,880
I'm full focus.

2992
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:34,060
No, I can do this.

2993
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:35,560
I can do this.

2994
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:41,120
Alright.

2995
02:17:48,410 --> 02:17:49,130
Are you serious?

2996
02:17:49,250 --> 02:17:49,370
Okay.

2997
02:17:49,570 --> 02:17:50,510
I fucked up the dodge there.

2998
02:17:51,190 --> 02:17:51,870
Oh my god.

2999
02:17:51,950 --> 02:17:52,470
This is not the run.

3000
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:52,830
Nevermind.

3001
02:17:52,930 --> 02:17:53,530
This is not the...

3002
02:17:54,170 --> 02:17:55,950
This is not the focus run!

3003
02:17:56,590 --> 02:17:57,690
This was not it!

3004
02:17:58,470 --> 02:18:00,110
This was not the focus run!

3005
02:18:00,330 --> 02:18:00,450
Okay.

3006
02:18:00,710 --> 02:18:00,970
Now!

3007
02:18:01,730 --> 02:18:03,530
Now is the focus run!

3008
02:18:09,330 --> 02:18:09,890
Go ahead.

3009
02:18:09,970 --> 02:18:10,750
Thank you for the super chat.

3010
02:18:10,930 --> 02:18:11,510
Thank you.

3011
02:18:12,190 --> 02:18:13,310
I've been playing Rivals for rank.

3012
02:18:13,390 --> 02:18:14,210
What did I come back to?

3013
02:18:14,290 --> 02:18:14,970
A failed re...

3014
02:18:14,970 --> 02:18:16,150
A failed rebellion.

3015
02:18:16,490 --> 02:18:17,330
But don't worry.

3016
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:18,450
We're okay now.

3017
02:18:21,470 --> 02:18:22,670
Morale has risen.

3018
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:26,410
Just a little rebellion that I had to...

3019
02:18:26,410 --> 02:18:26,810
Crush.

3020
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:49,050
Did I...

3021
02:18:49,050 --> 02:18:49,590
Didn't bleed?

3022
02:18:49,710 --> 02:18:50,890
I can't tell if I didn't bleed.

3023
02:18:55,670 --> 02:18:56,190
Shit.

3024
02:18:58,570 --> 02:18:59,410
Oh fuck.

3025
02:18:59,610 --> 02:18:59,730
Oh fuck.

3026
02:18:59,810 --> 02:19:00,530
Wrong time to heal.

3027
02:19:01,830 --> 02:19:02,350
Okay.

3028
02:19:02,430 --> 02:19:02,730
Now I can.

3029
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:04,390
Are you serious again?

3030
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:05,870
Three fireballs?

3031
02:19:09,170 --> 02:19:09,690
Oh.

3032
02:19:10,730 --> 02:19:12,190
I need to remember not to...

3033
02:19:12,190 --> 02:19:12,950
Sweat there.

3034
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:18,670
Yeah.

3035
02:19:22,250 --> 02:19:23,210
Yeah.

3036
02:19:23,210 --> 02:19:23,690
What?!

3037
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:28,890
Dodged that!

3038
02:19:32,090 --> 02:19:34,350
Oh, the blind dragoons.

3039
02:19:35,010 --> 02:19:36,750
She needs to learn!

3040
02:19:40,030 --> 02:19:41,630
Oh my god.

3041
02:19:41,830 --> 02:19:43,190
The attack was so delayed.

3042
02:19:45,270 --> 02:19:46,590
It was super delayed.

3043
02:19:46,590 --> 02:19:46,710
It was super delayed.

3044
02:19:48,090 --> 02:19:48,650
It was super delayed.

3045
02:19:48,650 --> 02:19:49,510
But I'm getting better though.

3046
02:19:49,810 --> 02:19:50,430
Every attempt.

3047
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:56,160
The guy knows.

3048
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:57,680
He knows what I wanna do.

3049
02:20:01,540 --> 02:20:03,100
We don't need you.

3050
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:05,060
You need a tyrant.

3051
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:07,980
Come on.

3052
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:09,780
Don't you guys miss the jingle jingle guys?

3053
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:10,540
Come on.

3054
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:15,120
Oh shit.

3055
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:18,480
Oh shit.

3056
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:25,840
Okay.

3057
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:26,320
Nice bleed.

3058
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:27,460
Are you serious?

3059
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:28,300
Oh my god.

3060
02:20:28,620 --> 02:20:29,980
I thought he would like...

3061
02:20:29,980 --> 02:20:32,060
I thought he would stumble more.

3062
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:33,020
But he didn't.

3063
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:37,160
Uh...

3064
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:37,240
Delay a little bit more.

3065
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:40,460
I thought he would like...

3066
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:40,980
Uh...

3067
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:41,800
Delay a little bit more.

3068
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:44,500
Okay.

3069
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:48,840
I know he wants to do one more attack too.

3070
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:51,580
Yeah.

3071
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:56,050
No not the delay!

3072
02:20:56,110 --> 02:20:56,450
Oh nice!

3073
02:21:01,260 --> 02:21:02,320
I hate that one.

3074
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:05,820
Okay.

3075
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:05,900
Okay.

3076
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:10,400
Time that.

3077
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:12,740
Nice.

3078
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:18,700
There's, like, so little room for this.

3079
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:19,700
Are you serious?

3080
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:21,120
Oh!

3081
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:27,740
There's, like, so little room to fucking hit him!

3082
02:21:28,300 --> 02:21:28,820
Twice?

3083
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:31,020
He did that twice!

3084
02:21:43,050 --> 02:21:44,350
Oh, my God.

3085
02:21:46,850 --> 02:21:48,030
Oh, my God!

3086
02:21:48,210 --> 02:21:49,130
That one was bullshit!

3087
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:53,130
That one was actually bullshit.

3088
02:21:53,890 --> 02:21:54,610
Holy shit.

3089
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:02,800
I still... Oh, my God.

3090
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:03,840
That was bullshit.

3091
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:04,680
Appraise!

3092
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,160
Appraise!

3093
02:22:05,260 --> 02:22:06,060
Message appraise!

3094
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:06,580
Nice.

3095
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:07,020
Haha.

3096
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:14,620
Oh, no.

3097
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:15,860
Oh, no.

3098
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:16,680
Oh, no.

3099
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:17,240
NOOO!

3100
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:20,040
I didn't know where to go.

3101
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:22,680
Message appraise!

3102
02:22:22,860 --> 02:22:23,460

02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:31,480
Fucking hell.

3108
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:34,620
Nice.

3109
02:22:42,250 --> 02:22:42,990
Okay.

3110
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:50,760
Okay.

3111
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:50,860
Okay.

3112
02:22:52,780 --> 02:22:53,700
Are you serious?

3113
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:54,300
That hit me?

3114
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:56,040
Guys, it's message appraise time.

3115
02:22:56,260 --> 02:22:57,020
Message appraise!

3116

Oh, my God.

Okay.

3119
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:04,120
That's good.

3120
02:23:08,090 --> 02:23:08,970
No, not the...

3121
02:23:08,970 --> 02:23:09,190
No, not the...

3122
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:09,370
No, not the...

3123
02:23:09,370 --> 02:23:09,430
No!

3124
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:09,950
Fuck!

3125
02:23:15,470 --> 02:23:16,370
Oh, no.

3126
02:23:16,630 --> 02:23:17,230
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3127
02:23:20,450 --> 02:23:21,410
The fireball!

3128
02:23:27,530 --> 02:23:27,850
God!

3129
02:23:28,510 --> 02:23:29,810
Not the fire...

3130
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:30,850
I missed it.

3131
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:32,590
Please show me again.

3132
02:23:33,930 --> 02:23:34,890
More fall.

3133
02:23:35,330 --> 02:23:36,910
Thank you for the super chat.

3134
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:37,430
Thank you.

3135
02:23:37,630 --> 02:23:38,050
Thank you.

3136
02:24:01,570 --> 02:24:02,490
Oh, shit.

3137
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:02,750
Okay.

3138
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:03,850
That was...

3139
02:24:03,850 --> 02:24:04,170
Okay.

3140
02:24:04,290 --> 02:24:05,110
I would admit...

3141
02:24:05,110 --> 02:24:06,010
I got greedy there.

3142
02:24:09,650 --> 02:24:10,110
Nice.

3143
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:20,340
Jesus.

3144
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:21,700
Okay, that was deserved.

3145
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:23,520
And not Mina.

3146
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:26,300
God damn it.

3147
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:32,630
I'm actually focusing so hard for these, this one.

3148
02:24:37,330 --> 02:24:37,810
What?

3149
02:24:38,050 --> 02:24:39,450
Okay, that should not hit me though.

3150
02:24:41,730 --> 02:24:43,370
That one should not hit me there.

3151
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:52,640
Okay!

3152
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:54,120
Alright!

3153
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:56,360
That should have been a dodge!

3154
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:59,160
That was a dodge!

3155
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:05,700
That was a fucking dodge!

3156
02:25:07,720 --> 02:25:09,740
Hold the line!

3157
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:14,080
Deserve!

3158
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:16,000
That was bullshit.

3159
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:17,540
That was fucking bullshit.

3160
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:28,620
It's optional, but, fuck it.

3161
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I mean, at least I'll get like, I'll get like, uh, runes for it.

3162
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:33,640
Oh, man.

3163
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:39,360
In the end, it's just like, you get- I'll just play better.

3164
02:25:39,860 --> 02:25:40,700
Doing this.

3165
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:42,320
Okay, not right now, obviously.

3166
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:48,900
Okay, nevermind.

3167
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:49,900
Now!

3168
02:25:50,460 --> 02:25:52,000
After this, I'll play better.

3169
02:25:53,060 --> 02:25:54,060
After this.

3170
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:04,100
I'll play better.

3171
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:05,540
After this, I'll play better.

3172
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:09,520
Okay.

3173
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:13,360
Now reward myself with some pizza later.

3174
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:20,080
We'll bring Jingle Jangle back after we defeated him.

3175
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:23,740
Then the Dragoons get their reward.

3176
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:24,820
And boost morale.

3177
02:26:35,030 --> 02:26:36,870
Doesn't come for free, guys!

3178
02:26:45,330 --> 02:26:46,050
Yeah.

3179
02:26:47,270 --> 02:26:49,090
She's lying to you, chat!

3180
02:26:54,150 --> 02:26:54,510
Guys!

3181
02:26:54,890 --> 02:26:56,270
You guys appraise!

3182
02:26:57,470 --> 02:26:59,770
We'll get our Jingle Jangle back!

3183
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:04,230
Jesus Christ!

3184
02:27:04,910 --> 02:27:06,190
Are you serious?

3185
02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:12,410
That's right.

3186
02:27:12,410 --> 02:27:13,550
Oh, fuck.

3187
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:29,750
Sometimes I don't know, like, which one is the... Because there's, like, that attack sometimes... That!

3188
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:32,450
Okay, that was a good dodge for it, too.

3189
02:27:32,910 --> 02:27:33,970
That was bullshit.

3190
02:27:34,230 --> 02:27:35,770
That was actually a good dodge.

3191
02:27:44,510 --> 02:27:45,510
Oh, my god.

3192
02:27:45,810 --> 02:27:47,150
I hate these delay attacks.

3193
02:27:47,350 --> 02:27:48,810
These delay attacks are so bullshit.

3194
02:27:55,160 --> 02:27:56,920
The horse shouldn't even be part of this.

3195
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:03,660
The horse shouldn't be part of these attacks.

3196
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:05,000
That's not fair.

3197
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:06,040
If I...

3198
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:10,680
can't have my jellyfish, his horse should not be blowing fire.

3199
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:13,880
That's all I'm saying.

3200
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:24,070
Okay.

3201
02:28:28,470 --> 02:28:29,210
Oh, shit.

3202
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:38,460
Are you serious?

3203
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:39,060
Oh!

3204
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:40,940
My bad.

3205
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:41,940
Are you one?

3206
02:28:42,060 --> 02:28:43,140
Okay, that's bullshit.

3207
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:45,120
That one was bullshit.

3208
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:48,580
That one was bullshit.

3209
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:55,460
Oh, my god.

3210
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:56,260
Okay, that was green.

3211
02:28:56,740 --> 02:28:57,260
That was...

3212
02:28:57,260 --> 02:28:58,460
That was green!

3213
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:00,780
I greeted that.

3214
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:03,080
I greeted that.

3215
02:29:06,460 --> 02:29:08,200
I greeted that so hard.

3216
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:10,680
I was like, do I dodge or do I hit?

3217
02:29:10,740 --> 02:29:11,920
And I was like, no, I'll hit that.

3218
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:14,660
I knew... I knew it was green, too.

3219
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:15,820
I knew instantly.

3220
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:18,500
I greeted too hard.

3221
02:29:22,330 --> 02:29:22,910
I knew it was green.

3222
02:29:22,910 --> 02:29:23,490
Alright, it's fine.

3223
02:29:26,410 --> 02:29:27,090
It's fine.

3224
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:42,860
Okay.

3225
02:29:45,580 --> 02:29:46,460
Oh, my god.

3226
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:47,030
Okay, that...

3227
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:49,720
I'm gonna, like, knock me dead sometimes.

3228
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:51,960
Oh, fuck.

3229
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:55,940
It's fine.

3230
02:30:00,310 --> 02:30:00,730
Okay.

3231
02:30:04,530 --> 02:30:06,210
And then he's gonna do one more.

3232
02:30:07,950 --> 02:30:10,750
I'm, like, trying to remember patterns now.

3233
02:30:14,110 --> 02:30:15,710
Okay, I'll do one more hit.

3234
02:30:16,310 --> 02:30:17,070
Oh, no.

3235
02:30:17,390 --> 02:30:17,530
Okay.

3236
02:30:20,570 --> 02:30:21,550
Okay, we got...

3237
02:30:21,550 --> 02:30:22,170
Get out of here.

3238
02:30:22,770 --> 02:30:23,170
Got it.

3239
02:30:23,350 --> 02:30:24,170
Oh, we got out of there.

3240
02:30:26,490 --> 02:30:26,970
Alright.

3241
02:30:28,750 --> 02:30:29,230
That.

3242
02:30:31,650 --> 02:30:32,130
Okay.

3243
02:30:35,250 --> 02:30:35,730
Okay.

3244
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:40,580
God damn it.

3245
02:30:42,820 --> 02:30:43,680
Okay, nice.

3246
02:30:43,820 --> 02:30:44,500
It's not...

3247
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:46,340
Oh, I'm so locked in.

3248
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:53,820
Not this one.

3249
02:30:53,940 --> 02:30:54,060
Not...

3250
02:30:54,060 --> 02:30:54,420
Oh, god.

3251
02:30:54,900 --> 02:30:55,520
That one...

3252
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:56,700
That one is my...

3253
02:30:56,700 --> 02:30:57,320
That...

3254
02:30:57,320 --> 02:30:58,780
That one is so bullshit!

3255
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:01,760
That attack is so bullshit.

3256
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:03,320
That is such a bullshit attack.

3257
02:31:08,710 --> 02:31:09,490
Oh, my god.

3258
02:31:09,630 --> 02:31:10,730
I hate that attack the most.

3259
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:21,200
Oh, my god.

3260
02:31:21,380 --> 02:31:21,800
Fuck you.

3261
02:31:26,230 --> 02:31:26,590
Oh.

3262
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:33,500
No, no.

3263
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:34,620
Ah, I dodged too early.

3264
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,600
I knew I dodged too early, too.

3265
02:31:41,860 --> 02:31:42,300
Okay.

3266
02:31:44,900 --> 02:31:45,720
Oh, my god.

3267
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:46,220
Come on.

3268
02:31:46,280 --> 02:31:46,940
I dodged that.

3269
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:51,360
I dodged that one.

3270
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:55,160
No!

3271
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:55,680
Fuck!

3272
02:31:56,600 --> 02:31:57,140
I knew...

3273
02:31:57,140 --> 02:31:57,580
I knew...

3274
02:31:58,040 --> 02:31:59,320
I was gonna do that, too.

3275
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:01,240
No!

3276
02:32:01,400 --> 02:32:02,700
Not that fucking delayed attack!

3277
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:05,720
Okay.

3278
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:08,780
Okay.

3279
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:11,180
Alright.

3280
02:32:19,610 --> 02:32:20,730
You serious?

3281
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:21,450
You bitch!

3282
02:32:24,250 --> 02:32:24,950
Oh!

3283
02:32:25,550 --> 02:32:26,330
Greed.

3284
02:32:29,150 --> 02:32:29,850
Greed.

3285
02:32:30,430 --> 02:32:31,710
My fucking greed.

3286
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:39,660
Okay.

3287
02:32:46,730 --> 02:32:47,430
Nice.

3288
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:55,820
Fucker, you fucker, you fucker, you fucker, you fucker, you fucker, you fucker, you fucker.

3289
02:32:59,360 --> 02:32:59,800
Alright.

3290
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:03,620
I hate this attack so much.

3291
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:12,420
No, no, no, no, no!

3292
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:12,860
Not this one!

3293
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:13,300
Oh!

3294
02:33:15,340 --> 02:33:15,780
No!

3295
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:16,760
I fucking knew it!

3296
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:20,140
Every time.

3297
02:33:26,190 --> 02:33:28,590
No, it's the one that, like, it's...

3298
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:29,250
Oh, my god.

3299
02:33:29,490 --> 02:33:30,050
It's the...

3300
02:33:30,050 --> 02:33:35,250
The one I hate the most is the one where he delays it and has so much AoE.

3301
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:38,790
Because it's so hard to dodge.

3302
02:33:39,870 --> 02:33:40,710
In general.

3303
02:33:47,010 --> 02:33:47,850
Oh, fuck.

3304
02:33:53,550 --> 02:33:54,030
Okay.

3305
02:34:01,670 --> 02:34:02,490
Oh, nice.

3306
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:02,750
Okay.

3307
02:34:03,270 --> 02:34:06,290
I know I didn't hit it, but I'd rather just not take damage from that attack.

3308
02:34:08,410 --> 02:34:08,890
Really?

3309
02:34:10,230 --> 02:34:11,430
That hits me?

3310
02:34:13,030 --> 02:34:13,510
Oh.

3311
02:34:23,030 --> 02:34:23,510
Okay.

3312
02:34:28,790 --> 02:34:29,750
This one's this one.

3313
02:34:29,830 --> 02:34:30,370
I hate this one.

3314
02:34:31,210 --> 02:34:32,170
And this one, too.

3315
02:34:32,730 --> 02:34:34,570
I don't know what to do for that.

3316
02:34:35,830 --> 02:34:37,850
I don't know how to dodge that one.

3317
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:45,260
Oh, my god.

3318
02:34:45,420 --> 02:34:45,940
Come on.

3319
02:34:49,790 --> 02:34:51,890
I actually don't know how to dodge that one.

3320
02:34:53,770 --> 02:34:55,370
I have to roll into it.

3321
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:55,950
Okay.

3322
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:04,350
Are you serious?

3323
02:35:04,670 --> 02:35:04,750
Oh.

3324
02:35:05,970 --> 02:35:06,550
Sucks.

3325
02:35:10,510 --> 02:35:11,510
No, no, no, no, no.

3326
02:35:12,370 --> 02:35:13,130
No.

3327
02:35:18,620 --> 02:35:19,380
Yes!

3328
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:20,460
Yes!

3329
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:23,740
I did it!

3330
02:35:24,460 --> 02:35:25,840
Oh, my god!

3331
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:27,380
Oh!

3332
02:35:27,740 --> 02:35:29,100
28,000!

3333
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:32,820
That's fucking whatever.

3334
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:33,860
Whatever.

3335
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:35,520
Whatever.

3336
02:35:36,950 --> 02:35:37,440
Whatever.

3337
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:39,060
A win's a win.

3338
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:41,260
A win's a win.

3339
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:43,480
28,000.

3340
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:45,300
That's it.

3341
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:46,280
I'm becoming him.

3342
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:47,800
That's it.

3343
02:35:55,080 --> 02:35:56,300
All right.

3344
02:35:56,600 --> 02:35:59,660
Just because I promise to raise morale.

3345
02:36:03,080 --> 02:36:04,880
To raise morale.

3346
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:10,540
I shall also become him.

3347
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:11,600
All right.

3348
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:14,440
Oh, what is it?

3349
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:15,160
Is it this one?

3350
02:36:16,980 --> 02:36:17,980
Is this one, right?

3351
02:36:18,520 --> 02:36:19,660
I am him now.

3352
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:22,980
Oh, shit.

3353
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:24,300
My rolls are so tanky.

3354
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:25,920
All right.

3355
02:36:26,040 --> 02:36:26,120
Wait.

3356
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:26,800
Maybe we gotta...

3357
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:26,940
Okay.

3358
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:27,940
We have to take some off.

3359
02:36:28,180 --> 02:36:30,060
We have to take some off.

3360
02:36:30,280 --> 02:36:31,400
I cannot be...

3361
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:31,940
I'm sorry.

3362
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:33,640
Like, this is little...

3363
02:36:35,560 --> 02:36:35,960
Okay.

3364
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:37,640
Okay.

3365
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:38,000
There we go.

3366
02:36:38,060 --> 02:36:38,560
We gotta take that.

3367
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:38,760
Okay.

3368
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:39,080
It's fine.

3369
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:40,180
We're half of him.

3370
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:41,880
We're half of him.

3371
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:42,760
All right.

3372
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:43,100
It's fine.

3373
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:43,780
Now we're fine.

3374
02:36:44,620 --> 02:36:45,200
All right.

3375
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:45,560
All right.

3376
02:36:47,060 --> 02:36:47,760
All right.

3377
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:48,660
Toward myself.

3378
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:51,320
I'm half of him.

3379
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:53,080
I'm...

3380
02:36:55,880 --> 02:36:58,200
Many, thank you for the super chat.

3381
02:36:58,380 --> 02:36:58,760
Thank you.

3382
02:36:59,000 --> 02:36:59,640
Thank you.

3383
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:00,800
Thank you.

3384
02:37:02,020 --> 02:37:02,980
More falls.

3385
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:04,500
Thank you for the super chat.

3386
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:04,960
Thank you.

3387
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:05,600
Thank you.

3388
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:07,560
We have successfully raised morale.

3389
02:37:08,300 --> 02:37:08,700
We have...

3390
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:11,240
Rebellion has been quenched.

3391
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:13,880
All hail Doki Bird.

3392
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:20,120
All hail Doki Bird.

3393
02:37:20,120 --> 02:37:22,000
Phrase the mighty Doki Bird.

3394
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:23,440
She graces us.

3395
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:24,500
Swordsman.

3396
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:26,120
Thank you for the super chat.

3397
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:26,620
Thank you.

3398
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:27,440
Thank you.

3399
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:30,140
All right.

3400
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:31,320
We're gonna call it here.

3401
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:34,040
I just said today was a short stream today.

3402
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:37,340
And, um, so I'm gonna call it here, everyone.

3403
02:37:37,340 --> 02:37:40,800
So my voice can, my voice can recover.

3404
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:44,320
Because we had a lot of streams, a lot of long streams today.

3405
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:48,980
But, I hope you guys had a fun time today with me.

3406
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:51,980
Um, to all my loyal dragoons.

3407
02:37:52,880 --> 02:38:00,480
To all my dragoon scabs out there who, um, didn't listen to the false prophets and the fake news.

3408
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:07,700
And the, and, and, and followed the law of Doki Bird and praised my messages.

3409
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:11,340
To my loyal fans.

3410
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:16,520
I hope you guys had a fun time, everyone.

3411
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:18,940
As, I'm gonna go head off now.

3412
02:38:19,180 --> 02:38:20,200
I'm gonna order my pizza!

3413
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:21,540
I'm gonna order my pizza.

3414
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:23,680
Because I have no, no super chat reading today.

3415
02:38:23,940 --> 02:38:28,220
But, I still hope you guys had a lot of fun with me, uh, for today's Elden Ring streams.

3416
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:34,660
Um, as always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3417
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:37,020
And if you, except for me, head to bed.

3418
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:38,440
Cause, you deserve it.

3419
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:40,260
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3420
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:41,500
Bye, guys!

3421
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:42,420
Bye!
