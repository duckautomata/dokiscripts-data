1
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,060
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,480
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,640
Yes, I am still echoing because I am still traveling.

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
I'm still not back at home yet.

5
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,700
Soon, though.

6
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,360
Soon, soon.

7
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,620
But today, we are gonna be playing Deltarune.

8
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,640
Yes!

9
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,040
Okay, I know some people are far-sounding.

10
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,860
Wait, do I sound like I'm really far away?

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Should I up my mic a little bit more?

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,800
Okay, oh my gosh.

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:21,720
I wish I had, like, a thing where I can raise this up a little, but I forgot to get, like, a thing, a perch.

14
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,900
Wait, I think I can use this.

15
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,580
Okay.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,560
Okay, give me a sec.

17
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,480
I think I can use this.

18
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,140
I think I can use this as, like, a little perch thing.

19
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,420
Alright.

20
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,300
It's like, it's my wallet.

21
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm using, but, okay.

22
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,860
Okay.

23
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,900
Okay, I might sound a little closer now.

24
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,280
Do I sound... Wait.

25
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:51,860
Oh, my God.

26
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,660
I have a blanket on my fucking legs because... Because it's cold.

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,520
Does it sound better?

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,380
Guys, I am a little closer.

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,000
This is... Does it sound a little... A lot better now?

30
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,820
Okay.

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,480
A bit?

32
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,220
Okay.

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,880
I could.

34
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,280
Um... Is it a little better now?

35
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,280
Uh... Yes, my wallet has...

36
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,640
Mine's a zipper.

37
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,160
Mine's a zip wallet.

38
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,380
Um... It's, like, those really long wallets.

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,960
Uh... It's, like, those really long wallets.

40
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,240
The rectangular ones.

41
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,280
And you zip it open and you zip it... Yeah.

42
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,460
Anyway.

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,060
Okay.

44
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,300
So, um...

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,560
What was I gonna say?

46
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:31,960
Oh, yeah.

47
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,520
Uh... Deltarune.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
Um... I won't lie and say that...

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,780
This is not my first time playing Deltarune.

50
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,600
Um... But, uh... I only played Chapter 1.

51
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
So, uh...

52
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,900
Chapter 1.

53
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,180
And that was 7 years ago.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,580
That was 7 years ago.

55
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,380
If you guys don't remember...

56
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:05,820
Deltarune, Chapter 1, released on Halloween in 2018.

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:19,840
And that was the first time and last time I've ever played Deltarune.

58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,540
Because I knew, I knew, fucking Toby Fox would take years.

59
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,600
Because when I saw that he was like, I'm releasing it chapter by chapter.

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,360
And not making, like, not fully releasing a completed game.

61
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,240
I knew he would take fucking forever to finish this game.

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,860
So, I was like, I'm gonna wait.

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:59,400
I was like, I'm gonna wait until the game is more finished.

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Because I have a feeling he was gonna take a long time to finish the entire game.

65
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,420
Um, because if he's gonna make it episodic, I am not fucking waiting.

66
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:20,460
Like, it's a Netflix show where the Stranger Things has also taken seven plus years...

67
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:28,060
By the way, if you guys wanna know, Stranger Things has also followed the exact time frame.

68
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,180
Where I believe it's been running for, like, seven plus years now.

69
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,260
And...

70
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,220
And...

71
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,820
And I don't fucking know what goes on in between seasons anymore.

72
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,260
I don't know.

73
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,200
Because it takes so long for each new season.

74
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,360
It takes so long.

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,520
It takes, like, I don't know, like, two plus years to film one season.

76
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,120
That, like, that, like, I have to wait two plus years for each season.

77
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,160
That I just forget what happens the last season.

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,000
So, I... that's why I waited.

79
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,940
I waited until the game is getting more completed.

80
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,420
Before...

81
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:11,980
Before...

82
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,960
Before...

83
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,580
Before we go on to...

84
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,900
Oh, yeah.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,140
Season one for Stranger Things was nine years ago.

86
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,080
That's even...

87
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,600
That makes it so much worse.

88
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,460
Holy fuck.

89
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,120
Okay.

90
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:24,780
Yeah.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
It was nine years ago.

92
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,680
So, I wasn't...

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,700
Or, like, you know...

94
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,060
Or, like, an Amazon series.

95
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,420
Seriously.

96
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,080
It's, like...

97
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm...

98
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,120
I'm so tired.

99
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,380
Okay.

100
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,400
I've wanted to rant about this for the longest time.

101
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,220
And this is, like, the perfect time to rant about it.

102
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:46,360
But I am so fucking tired of shows taking fucking years in between filming for the next season.

103
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,280
Like, I understand.

104
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,620
Like, it takes a long time to film these shows.

105
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,420
Because, you know, they want to have good quality.

106
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,180
But I don't know what's going on anymore.

107
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,960
I don't know.

108
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,920
Because, like...

109
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,840
Because it takes so long to release in between seasons.

110
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:15,140
And then I have to watch a recap episode to remember what happens last season or maybe three seasons ago.

111
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,820
Like, I forgot what's going on.

112
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,240
Like, I remember trying to watch...

113
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,620
Oh, my God.

114
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,120
What was it?

115
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,680
The Boys.

116
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,420
Oh, my God.

117
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,900
When, like, The Boys new season came out.

118
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,880
I remember, like...

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,760
Like, every time The Boys new season comes out, I'm like, what the fuck happened?

120
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,420
I don't remember.

121
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,180
I was like...

122
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,220
I didn't have to watch the recap episode.

123
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,560
Because I'm like, what the fuck happened?

124
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,920
Like...

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,120
What happened?

126
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,900
I don't know.

127
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,760
I was like, wait, who's this guy again?

128
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,720
And, like, oh yeah, this happened.

129
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh yeah, we're trying to figure out this thing.

130
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,560
Same with, like, any Netflix show.

131
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,640
Any fucking Netflix show that comes out and, like, you're, like, invested in it.

132
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,040
But then you're, like, you unfortunately got invested in it in season one.

133
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,520
So... So you're, like, what the fuck happened?

134
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,000
Like... That happened to me on BoJack Horseman.

135
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,640
When BoJack Horseman was still playing...

136
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,120
And then, like, you know, it took, like, years for, like, you know, because it's an animated show.

137
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,200
It takes years for it to release in between.

138
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,060
And I always forget.

139
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,620
I have to... I always forget.

140
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,700
I was, like, what the fuck did BoJack do again?

141
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,200
Like, how did he fuck up again?

142
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,380
I don't remember.

143
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,280
I... He fucks up so many times.

144
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,020
And it's been so fucking long.

145
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,760
I watched three other TV shows already.

146
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,920
I am not remembering these plot points.

147
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,360
I... It's been way too long.

148
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,280
So... So... So... Anyway.

149
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,100
So this is the same as Deltarune.

150
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,920
So, like I said, I played Deltarune Chapter 1.

151
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,460
Um... Back in 2018.

152
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,900
And I waited.

153
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,540
I... And now I heard that Toby Fox has released two new chapters.

154
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,440
But it's still not complete yet.

155
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,860
So I guess... Maybe I should have waited.

156
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,680
I don't know.

157
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,420
Eight more years before I started my Deltarune playthrough.

158
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,680
But I needed... I needed... I was just like... Ah, fuck it.

159
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,960
Like, I don't know what to stream this week.

160
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,700
And I need something that doesn't take up, like, 60 gigabytes of RAM.

161
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,900
And, like... I was like, you know what?

162
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,900
Like, Deltarune just... Like, the two new chapters of Deltarune just came out...

163
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,140
Came out, like, two days ago.

164
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,600
Or yesterday.

165
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,020
Yesterday.

166
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,060
It gets the right... I guess it gets the right time to start.

167
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,180
All right.

168
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,660
I'm gonna forget all four chapters when Chapter 5 fucking comes out in eight years.

169
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,820
But, like...

170
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,460
Like, what can I do?

171
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,620
Like...

172
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,900
It's too late.

173
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,460
Maybe... Maybe by the time I finish Chapter 4, Chapter 5 will come out.

174
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,380
I'll...

175
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,460
Oh, yeah!

176
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,000
Chapter 5 in 2020... Oh, thank God.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,340
Okay.

178
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,000
I forgot.

179
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,920
Spoiler alert.

180
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,160
They confirmed Chapter... They... I remember Toby Fox tweeted out today.

181
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,800
Sorry.

182
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,340
Toby Fox tweeted out today.

183
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,400
Um... That, like... Oh, yeah.

184
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,720
You finished all four chapters.

185
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,940
Remember to, like, not quit right away.

186
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,900
Because he told... Said that Chapter 5 is coming out in...

187
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,820
2026.

188
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,180
But, sorry.

189
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,480
Let me correct myself.

190
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,220
I meant... Maybe by then, the game will be completed in six years.

191
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,520
Sorry.

192
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,280
Let me make a little correction.

193
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,000
I meant the game being completed.

194
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,680
Like...

195
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,280
Like...

196
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,980
I feel like, at that point, maybe...

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,200
Hope's crushed.

198
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,200
Yeah.

199
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,280
Um... Also...

200
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,820
Sound guy, if there's any edits I need to do for my sound...

201
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,660
Uh... When we boot up the game...

202
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,360
You can chat on... In chat.

203
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,380
Because I finally fixed YTC filter.

204
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,320
Um...

205
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,640
Um...

206
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:03,980
But, yeah.

207
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,780
Um...

208
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,640
We're gonna see how far we can do for Chapter 1.

209
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,880
Um... I don't know if I can finish Chapter 1.

210
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,460
Um... All the way today.

211
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,880
Like I said, I don't remember much about Chapter 1.

212
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,940
Except for the plot twist.

213
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,200
I know the ending...

214
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,060
Of...

215
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,240
I knew... I know the ending of Chapter 1.

216
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,920
So, like, I won't be surprised by that.

217
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,980
Because that was, like...

218
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,080
I felt like the...

219
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,440
I remember...

220
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,400
The ending of Chapter 1 was, like, you know...

221
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,860
The whole...

222
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,520
The biggest plot twist.

223
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,000
Like...

224
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,340
Like, it was, like, the...

225
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,520
Gotcha moment for Chapter 1.

226
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,320
So, I do remember Chapter 1.

227
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,620
Despite it being...

228
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,240
Seven years.

229
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,800
So...

230
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,420
Um...

231
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:39,600
Yeah.

232
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,620
It was, like, the...

233
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,460
The cliffhanger.

234
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,460
So...

235
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:42,700
Uh...

236
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,760
So, I still remember how it ends.

237
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,920
Um...

238
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,120
But other than that...

239
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,400
Um...

240
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,240
Uh...

241
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,200
That's, like, all I could remember.

242
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,780
Like...

243
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,160
I...

244
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,260
I don't remember anything.

245
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,800
Anyway...

246
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,940
Some people were asking about my history with Undertale.

247
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,860
Um...

248
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,460
I have not...

249
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,700
Oh, someone was like...

250
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,240
Oh, we noticed that your thing...

251
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,080
Um...

252
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,140
Um...

253
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,500
The thing...

254
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,880
Uh...

255
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,520
It says, until next heist.

256
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,740
I do have a new schedule template.

257
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,400
Hehe.

258
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,020
But I'm waiting until later to use it.

259
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,240
I don't want to, like, drop it right off the bat.

260
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,520
But, like, I do have a new schedule template.

261
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,920
And I have, like, new stuff.

262
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,700
But, like...

263
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,440
Not today.

264
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,060
Not when I'm on vacation.

265
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,020
Quote, unquote.

266
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,220
Technically, when I'm not working, it's considered a vacation.

267
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,740
Honestly, streaming is a vacation from the actual work I had to do.

268
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,560
I was literally, uh...

269
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,680
For the concert...

270
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,140
Um...

271
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,320
I was, like, doing so much stuff.

272
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:42,920
But, like...

273
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,340
Streaming is my vacation right now from my actual work stuff.

274
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,520
Because, um...

275
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,720
Right before I started my stream...

276
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,060
I was in...

277
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,380
I was talking with, like, five different people...

278
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,880
For behind-the-scenes work.

279
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,340
Like, I was just, like, on Discord.

280
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,400
Like, ba-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

281
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,500
With five different people.

282
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,480
Like...

283
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,960
And then I'm like...

284
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,160
Yay!

285
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,660
Vacation break time!

286
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,640
It's time to play Deltarune!

287
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
That's my vacation!

288
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,660
Like...

289
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,980
The best of both worlds...

290
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,960
Ba-da-ba-da-da-da.

291
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,660
Da-da-ba-da-ba-ba.

292
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,200
Sorry.

293
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,800
Oh my god.

294
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,040
I should have put Hannah Montana on my set list.

295
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,280
Hannah Montana is not on my set list, guys.

296
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,040
Oh my god.

297
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,020
I should have put that.

298
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,960
Best of both worlds.

299
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,360
Anyway,

300
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,140
okay, sorry.

301
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,960
Undertale.

302
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,280
So my history of Undertale.

303
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,060
I've never played Undertale by myself before.

304
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,130
I've watched every known playthrough...

305
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,060
Okay, not known, I don't even watch every playthrough.

306
00:13:52,280 --> 00:14:00,700
But I've watched, like, a lot of playthroughs of majority of the routes for... or, yeah, for all the routes for Undertale.

307
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,080
So, you know, I've done...I watched the Genocide route.

308
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,400
I watched the, uh, you know, the Peaceful route.

309
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:18,940
I watched the, you know, the , and I watched every ending and every route you could do for Undertale because I was obsessed with Undertale, but I wasn't, like, one of those people that played the games.

310
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,720
Because, uh...

311
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,300
Before I streamed...

312
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,320
before I was streamer, Absolutely.

313
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,740
I never liked playing single-player games.

314
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,040
I like watching other people play single-player games.

315
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,720
And I would just play multiplayer games.

316
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,720
I don't know, for me, for some reason, I just don't like playing single-player games by myself.

317
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,320
I don't know.

318
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,460
That's why now I'm catching up on all these games that I never got to play before.

319
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,000
Now, I've got to actually play, but I've watched people play.

320
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,480
Um, and getting to experience it myself.

321
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,360
Because I like, you know, playing these games and having you guys there watching me.

322
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,240
Like, I have, like, I don't know, it just feels different.

323
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,660
Having an audience, and I guess having backseaters is just better.

324
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:11,060
Like... I'm one of those rare VTubers, or not just VTubers, rare streamers that actually enjoy getting backseated.

325
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,460
Because I don't have to think for myself.

326
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,220
Like...

327
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm actually, I actually like having that experience.

328
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,420
Um, being, being told what to do.

329
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,020
Like...

330
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:37,340
Um... Um, so I'm one of, I'm one of the few streamers that I'm, like, okay with backseating.

331
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,000
Uh...

332
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,720
Because, it's like, you know, the streamer buff.

333
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,260
Yeah.

334
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,920
It's so onless and shameless.

335
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,360
Uh, all the concert guests are confirmed.

336
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:50,740
Yes.

337
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,740
Um, Gus, thank you for the super chat.

338
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,640
Thank you, thank you.

339
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,800
Not so Deadpool, thank you for the five gifted ships.

340
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,780
Thank you, thank you.

341
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,360
Yes, I love to, I love to use the streamer meta.

342
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,600
It's just more fun.

343
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,920
The shared experience is just a lot more fun.

344
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,960
Um, the only game, the, I think, like, one of the few games I've actually played myself.

345
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:20,900
Like, with, like, you know, like, as a single player is, uh, uh, um, is Stick of Truth from South Park.

346
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,120
Because that game was fucking fun.

347
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,200
Um, that was my game of the year when it came out.

348
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:36,540
But, South Park Stick of Truth was the, I think was one of the few games I've actually, it was South Park Stick of Truth and StarCraft, um, the campaigns.

349
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:45,380
That were one of the few games that, like, single player games that actually, like, played by myself, like, without watching other streams.

350
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,100
I didn't watch any streams of that.

351
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,280
I didn't watch any playthroughs.

352
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,280
I actually fully completed the game myself, just playing it.

353
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:59,100
Um, I think, I don't remember if there's any other games, but those were the two games, uh, that stuck out to me the most.

354
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:09,600
Someone was asking, I won't, I don't think I'll stream Stick of Truth ever, uh, ever on my channel, because, like, I already played it, so, like, I've explored everything of...

355
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,260
I got, like, a hundred percent completion on Stick of Truth, because I was fucking obsessed with that game.

356
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,320
So, like, it won't be, like, new to me.

357
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:35,740
Um, and, um, someone was asking me if I should, uh, if I would ever stream Fractured But Whole.

358
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,920
The thing is, I talked to one of my friends about that game, saying I never actually played it.

359
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,400
I haven't played a sequel of it yet.

360
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:50,000
And then one of my friends told me there is a really, really, really fucked up joke in there.

361
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,680
And it's... that's worse than any of the jokes that are in Stick of Truth.

362
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,360
I don't know what it is.

363
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,320
I mean...

364
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,760
Because I was like, no way, worse than the one about...

365
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,120
I don't know if I can say it.

366
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:18,300
I was gonna be like, wait, it's worse than, you know, that scene on, you know, you know, about a baby?

367
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:29,140
I was like, no way, it's worse than... it's worse than that scene about a particular baby?

368
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:37,120
And then my friend was like, yes, there are... there is a joke where it's worse than that.

369
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,760
And I was like, holy fuck.

370
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,120
Okay.

371
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,060
So, um...

372
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:54,660
So, I don't... I heard they, like, went... they, like, actually went beyond what Stick of Truth did.

373
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,460
So, I was like, oh, man, I don't know if I can stream that.

374
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
I don't know.

375
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,100
Like, everyone's mentioning a different joke.

376
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:10,520
Okay, but there was one scene in Fractured But Whole that I laughed at.

377
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:17,140
Because I saw, like, someone on Twitter talking about it and being like, oh my god, this is the...

378
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,100
Like, they say they skipped the cutscene or whatever.

379
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,380
And it was something regarding, like, Diabetes Kid.

380
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,300
Where he was like, with the power of insulin or whatever.

381
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,640
And then, like, they skipped the cutscene.

382
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,320
And then he was just dead.

383
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,760
Like...

384
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,920
So...

385
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,200
So, like...

386
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,320
Okay, Captain Diabetes.

387
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,280
Yeah, so, like, I saw that part.

388
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,800
I thought that was fucking hilarious.

389
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,840
I was like, what the fuck happened?

390
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,960
Like, yes.

391
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,380
I don't know if anybody ever saw that clip.

392
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,560
But that was a really good clip from that... from that game.

393
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,280
Um...

394
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Um...

395
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,400
Um...

396
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,340
Um...

397
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,540
That that how...

398
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,620
Okay, I...

399
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,600
I don't know!

400
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,600
I don't know what joke it is!

401
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,520
I don't know!

402
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,420
My friend just warned me and saying there's a joke worse than...

403
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,460
The thing about the baby in Stick of Truth.

404
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:21,700
But I can't elaborate more about the baby because it was a pretty bad scene about the baby.

405
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,340
It was...

406
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,480
It was...

407
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,580
It was...

408
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,080
It was a really bad scene.

409
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,060
Um...

410
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,600
Um...

411
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,840
Anyway...

412
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,600
Um...

413
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,480
Because that...

414
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:37,740
I...

415
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,100
I...

416
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,940
I was like, okay, if I stream Stick of Truth, what do I have to worry about?

417
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,840
There is a...

418
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,460
The scene about the balls.

419
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,160
Okay, for those who have ever played Stick of Truth, there's a scene about the balls.

420
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,800
And then there's the...

421
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,960
Any of the scenes that got censored in the Australian version.

422
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,360
For those who don't know...

423
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,320
Um...

424
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,460
The Stick of Truth in Australia got heavily censored.

425
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,220
And they would put like koalas or something over...

426
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,940
They would be like, sorry, because you bought this game in Australia.

427
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,860
We have...

428
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,100
They have censorship rules.

429
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,240
So we're here...

430
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,340
Here you go, Australians.

431
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,060
Here's a...

432
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,320
Picture of a koala.

433
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,680
Like...

434
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,760
Oh yeah.

435
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Also in EU too.

436
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,680
I don't know what they use for EU.

437
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,140
But like...

438
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,620
Uh...

439
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,080
They...

440
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,580
They did that for like...

441
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,260
Several things.

442
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,600
Like they did that for EU too.

443
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,280
So like any scene that got censored in Australia and EU were pretty bad.

444
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,260
They were...

445
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,360
They were...

446
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,240
They were...

447
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,080
They were...

448
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,300
I have to actually purchase the game from a European or Australian account.

449
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,580
So like I can't actually get the game in NA.

450
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,240
So...

451
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,940
I can't...

452
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,560
I can't get the game.

453
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,080
There.

454
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,100
Uh...

455
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:57,980
Um...

456
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,620
Um...

457
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:00,980
Anyway.

458
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:01,900
Uh...

459
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,140
Whoa.

460
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,560
Is that Doki Undertale?

461
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,020
Dr. Granberry, thank you for the super chat.

462
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,500
Thank you, thank you.

463
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,440
Okay, back to Undertale.

464
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,720
But yes, I loved Undertale.

465
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,820
I still love Undertale.

466
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,000
I was obsessed with Sans and Papyrus.

467
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,320
Obviously, I was more of a Sans fangirl.

468
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:15,920
Yes, I was...

469
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,860
I was one of the Sans fangirls.

470
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,780
Like who was just...

471
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,120
Always fucking obsessed with Sans.

472
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,800
Like all my friends knew how much I love Sans.

473
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:30,860
That like one of my friends actually commissioned a very popular Sans fan artist from Japan.

474
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,760
To...

475
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,580
To draw me and Sans together.

476
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
And I...

477
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,820
And have Sans wear like my new...

478
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,000
Newscap hat.

479
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
And like I had that as my wallpaper on my phone.

480
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,480
For like two years.

481
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,360
I...

482
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,120
And I also have...

483
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,020
You know like...

484
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,640
Um...

485
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,780
In Japan and Korea.

486
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,960
They have these like...

487
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,740
Uh...

488
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,120
Resin dolls and stuff.

489
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,000
There is a really famous Korean doll maker.

490
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,220
That specifically makes Sans...

491
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,060
Uh...

492
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,640
Dolls.

493
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,000
And like I...

494
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,380
I bought their Sans doll.

495
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,900
And their Underfell Sans doll.

496
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,120
And I still have it today.

497
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,260
I was...

498
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,420
Fucking obsessed with Sans.

499
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Like I...

500
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,500
My...

501
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,540
And I loved...

502
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,480
Underfell.

503
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,220
For those who don't know Underfell.

504
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,000
It is like an alternate...

505
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,200
It's a fan alternate universe.

506
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,420
Of Undertale.

507
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,240
Where the characters are evil.

508
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,580
So then I...

509
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,920
Because I was like...

510
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,900
Oh my god.

511
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,380
Evil Sans.

512
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,400
And it was a fan universe.

513
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,660
Called Underfell.

514
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,580
And...

515
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,960
I was like...

516
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,880
Oh my god.

517
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,500
That's so hot.

518
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,900
Evil Sans.

519
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,460
Oh my...

520
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,900
You know what's better than regular Sans?

521
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,300
Evil.

522
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,120
Edgy.

523
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,500
Sans.

524
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:55,540
Sans.

525
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,200
Look.

526
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,900
I...

527
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,100
It was a dark time.

528
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,820
For me.

529
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,780
Like...

530
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,560
It was...

531
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,580
It was...

532
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,420
I told you.

533
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,420
I was obsessed.

534
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,340
With Undertale.

535
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:12,800
Guys.

536
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,540
Okay.

537
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,440
And then...

538
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,380
Um...

539
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,240
But like I don't care.

540
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:17,640
I don't...

541
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,440
I don't remember all the...

542
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,720
I don't remember any of the other alternate universes.

543
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,520
For Undertale.

544
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,420
I literally just remember Underfell and Undertale.

545
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,140
Those are the only two universes.

546
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,480
Oh!

547
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,060
And then there's like the one where Sans is like...

548
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,540
Reverse with Papyrus.

549
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,120
I don't remember.

550
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,000
It wasn't like...

551
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't remember.

552
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,620
But it was one where like Sans is Papyrus.

553
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,740
And Papyrus is Sans.

554
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,720
Like the personality.

555
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:39,920
Change.

556
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,600
There was that.

557
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,160
That was...

558
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,960
I don't remember what that one was called.

559
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,180
Um...

560
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,040
Was it Underswap?

561
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,520
Oh yeah!

562
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,560
It was Underswap!

563
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,520
And then there was Underswap Sans.

564
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,080
Um...

565
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,760
So...

566
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,440
So...

567
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,280
Um...

568
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,540
So, I was obsessed with Underswap, Underfell, and Undertale Sans.

569
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,580
Just Sans.

570
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,340
Not too much about Papyrus.

571
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:07,720
I also commissioned a custom plushie of Sans and Papyrus from a plushie maker.

572
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,540
So, like, this was before Undertale had official plushie merch of Sans and Papyrus.

573
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:21,460
I literally paid, I think, like, $300 to have a custom Sans and Papyrus plushie.

574
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:28,460
Like, made because I was so obsessed.

575
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,500
I was in so deep.

576
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,560
You don't understand.

577
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,460
I was in so fucking deep.

578
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,280
I was obsessed.

579
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,400
Oh, and you want to know more?

580
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,460
I have a custom Sans helmet.

581
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:05,140
I have a helmet that was... that had LEDs of the eyes and I had to use as, like, a display thing.

582
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,200
I have a custom Sans helmet.

583
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,500
Later when I'm back home, I'll show pictures of everything.

584
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,340
And to show you guys how fucked up I was in the head about Undertale.

585
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,800
Specifically Sans.

586
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,560
I...

587
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,360
I like how it gets where she's like, okay, oh my god, that's pretty... that's pretty obsessive.

588
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,820
I mean, but that's it, right?

589
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
And I was like, no, there's more.

590
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,220
You guys don't understand.

591
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,280
There's more.

592
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,760
I...

593
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,320
You don't understand.

594
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,700
There is more.

595
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,300
There is more.

596
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,260
And then I just keep going and going and going.

597
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,640
I'm like, no, guys, there's still more.

598
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,280
I'm not done yet.

599
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,780
I'm not done yet.

600
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,960
I also have... remember when I said that, um...

601
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,340
I only have one doujin and that was from Dynasty Warriors.

602
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,980
JK, I have two.

603
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,240
I've remembered.

604
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,180
It was something related to Sans.

605
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,060
I won't say who he was shipped with because I actually don't remember.

606
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,400
I don't... I don't remember.

607
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,620
I don't remember.

608
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,100
I just... Sans was like a bicycle.

609
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,760
Like, as long as he's in that ship, I'm happy.

610
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,820
Like...

611
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,120
I... I...

612
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,260
It's like anybody can be shipped with him.

613
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,300
I'm happy.

614
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,780
As long as he's there, I'm fine with it.

615
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,280
I'm...

616
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,380
I'm...

617
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,000
Um...

618
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,500
A second doujin.

619
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,680
Um...

620
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,920
Anyway...

621
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,420
Um...

622
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,880
Anyway, so I was, like, crazy obsessed with Undertale, guys.

623
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,980
And my... I actually had, like, a lot of, like, their songs and, like, covers.

624
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,600
Um, and...

625
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,680
Look, no, it's even worse.

626
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,540
I did not care who he was with.

627
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,980
As long as...

628
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,120
Um...

629
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,400
As long as he was there, I was fine.

630
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,660
Also, all these Sans.doki has never...

631
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:15,920
Nope!

632
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,880
I actually did.

633
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,100
There is actual proof.

634
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:26,280
If you look through the archives from the before times, I defeated Sans three fucking times in three different games.

635
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,360
Like...

636
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,680
So...

637
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,160
So I did it.

638
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,660
I did do it.

639
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,760
I...

640
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,840
Thank you for the super chat.

641
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,240
Thank you.

642
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,060
Thank you.

643
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:39,820
Um...

644
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,290
But, like...

645
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,020
Um...

646
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,440
Um...

647
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,200
But, like I said, I had a crazy obsession.

648
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:45,920
Like, I...

649
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,620
I always have...

650
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,300
I always find one character that I'll be crazy obsessed with.

651
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,520
And then it would go really, really far.

652
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,380
No, it wasn't...

653
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,440
No, I never lied about not...

654
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,620
About being a Tumblr girl.

655
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,780
I told you guys.

656
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,080
I was on Tumblr.

657
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:00,960
Uh...

658
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,080
When Tumblr was a thing.

659
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,100
Like...

660
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,140
Robert, thank you for the super chat.

661
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,480
Thank you.

662
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,100
Thank you.

663
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,640
I...

664
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,740
I didn't lie about that.

665
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,280
I...

666
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,800
I was on Tumblr when it was...

667
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,200
When it was a thing.

668
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,960
Anyway, so that's my Undertale lore.

669
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,200
Uh...

670
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,340
I will show you guys pictures of everything when I'm back home.

671
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,820
I'll show you pictures of it.

672
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,460
Um...

673
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,340
When will I do it?

674
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,500
I'll do it on...

675
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,600
Next week.

676
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,420
I'll do it next week.

677
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,000
I'll show you...

678
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,120
Okay.

679
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,280
On part two of Deltarune.

680
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,160
On part two of Deltarune.

681
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,840
I'll show you guys pictures of all my Sans obsession.

682
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,840
On part two.

683
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,120
So...

684
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,200
So you know how bad it got.

685
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,940
So you know how...

686
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,460
But I'm reformed now.

687
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,700
I'm reformed.

688
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,060
It's...

689
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,760
It's not that bad anymore, guys.

690
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,240
It's...

691
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,900
It's...

692
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,000
It's not that bad anyway, guys.

693
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,460
I'm...

694
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,640
I'm okay now.

695
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,520
I'm...

696
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,140
It's true.

697
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:10,940
It's true.

698
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,620
I...

699
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,200
Look, guys.

700
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,840
It's true.

701
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,260
I...

702
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,680
I...

703
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,340
I...

704
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,860
I...

705
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,780
I got better.

706
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,720
I started playing Marvel...

707
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,260
I started playing competitive multiplayer shooters.

708
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,540
And I got better.

709
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,220
I...

710
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,860
I poured my obsession into long rank sessions.

711
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,140
Like...

712
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,920
Long rank grind sessions.

713
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,420
That's where it went to.

714
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,340
I don't know if that's an improvement or not.

715
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:36,960
Um...

716
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,220
It's an improvement to my wallet.

717
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,980
That's for sure.

718
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:39,800
Uh...

719
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,980
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

720
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,320
Thank you.

721
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,820
Thank you.

722
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,600
Thanks Doki for making me feel normal with my Doki merch.

723
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,640
It might make you stuff in my room.

724
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,900
Thank you for the super chat.

725
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,360
Thank you.

726
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:48,880
Thank you.

727
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,140
You replaced one addiction with another.

728
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,380
Hey!

729
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,360
I got better.

730
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:52,900
Guys.

731
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,720
I got better.

732
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:53,800
Okay.

733
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,980
Alright.

734
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,600
Let me boot up Deltarune now.

735
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,080
Alright.

736
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,400
Let's see.

737
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,420
Okay.

738
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,120
Let me...

739
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,320
Wait.

740
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,220
Can I not...

741
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,860
Is this not full screenable?

742
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,220
How the fuck do I full screen this?

743
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,040
Okay.

744
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,340
Okay.

745
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,480
Oh my god.

746
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,500
It's so tiny.

747
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,560
Why is it so tiny?

748
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,640
Uh...

749
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:14,940
Alright.

750
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,040
Deltarune.

751
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,040
It looks like...

752
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,380
Wait.

753
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,840
Where is it?

754
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,500
Why is it not showing on my fucking...

755
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,260
Oh...

756
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,900
Okay, guys.

757
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,620
Give me a sec.

758
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:25,760
Yes.

759
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,240
Continue on from chap...

760
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,380
Yeah.

761
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,660
Chapter one.

762
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,120
Yes.

763
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,260
What?

764
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
How do I...

765
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,620
Hello?

766
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,980
Oh, there we go.

767
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,400
Whoa!

768
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,720
Sorry.

769
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,440
I got scared.

770
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,420
Oh my god.

771
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,380
Please don't tell me.

772
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,420
It can only do...

773
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,560
I swear to god.

774
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,060
If this game is like...

775
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,400
Oh my god.

776
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,180
Please don't tell me this...

777
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,340
Okay.

778
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,840
Where is it?

779
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,100
Contact?

780
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,720
Why is it contact?

781
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,260
Hello?

782
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:57,940
Wait.

783
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,220
No.

784
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,540
I'm trying to get this game to show up.

785
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,340
Hahaha.

786
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,320
Hahaha.

787
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,200
Hahaha.

788
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,380
Oh my god.

789
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,100
Don't tell me it's window.

790
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,020
Oh my god.

791
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,260
It can't be game captured.

792
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,900
I swear to god.

793
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,020
Can this game not be game captured?

794
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,420
Okay.

795
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,180
Contact.

796
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,800
Alright.

797
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,220
Bum bum.

798
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,320
Bum bum.

799
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,540
It's...

800
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,060
Oh, I have to be OBS admin mode?

801
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:29,940
Okay.

802
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,040
Oh, that's awkward.

803
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:32,740
Okay.

804
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,780
Let's see if I can do it here.

805
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,980
Okay, I can do it for this.

806
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,340
Okay.

807
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,480
That's fine.

808
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,880
Okay.

809
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,600
That works.

810
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,000
Okay.

811
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,560
God, I hate doing window mode though.

812
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,120
Okay.

813
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,140
Okay, guys.

814
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:44,980
Alright.

815
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,760
Alright, guys.

816
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,460
Apparently, I have to do admin mode.

817
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,060
I'm gonna disappear for five...

818
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,260
For ten seconds, guys.

819
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:56,820
Alright.

820
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,600
I guess I have to restart my OBS in admin mode.

821
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,360
Okay, F4.

822
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,260
Okay, I have to do...

823
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,860
Oh my god.

824
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,580
I can't re-chat if I have to do F4 full screen.

825
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,400
Okay, I'm gonna play on this tiny box.

826
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,060
I...

827
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,780
Okay.

828
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,960
Up your back, guys.

829
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,300
I need to stream on.

830
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,240
I need...

831
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,620
Okay.

832
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,740
Okay.

833
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,940
Guys.

834
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,320
I...

835
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,740
Hello?

836
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,660
Oh, wait.

837
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,940
I stopped working too.

838
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,640
Oh my god.

839
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Everything is a problem now.

840
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,360
Oh my...

841
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,420
Okay.

842
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,900
Guys.

843
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,820
Okay.

844
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,840
I'll be right back again, guys.

845
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
I'll...

846
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,160
Guys.

847
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,900
Okay.

848
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,420
You can...

849
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,300
Yeah, but...

850
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,620
I can't see my screen.

851
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,740
I have to restart OBS again.

852
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,280
I'll be right back again, guys.

853
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,140
Okay.

854
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:56,820
Okay.

855
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,620
I'm back again.

856
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,800
I'm...

857
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,280
Okay.

858
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,160
Okay.

859
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:02,580
Okay.

860
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,180
Okay.

861
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,300
Okay.

862
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,520
Okay.

863
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:03,560
Okay.

864
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,360
So we have a problem.

865
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,200
I started in admin mode.

866
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,780
But like...

867
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,920
Do you guys see the game?

868
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,850
Do you...

869
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,070
Do you...

870
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,790
Do you...

871
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,170
Do...

872
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:20,590
Don't...

873
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:20,950
Yeah.

874
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,090
That's what I thought.

875
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,430
Same here.

876
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:24,530
I...

877
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:29,730
Yeah.

878
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,350
Yeah, I don't either.

879
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,750
So we have a problem.

880
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,350
We might have a problem right now.

881
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:51,430
Guys, I saw... I put it in admin mode and everything, so I don't know why it's not showing up.

882
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:57,470
I... No, I did.

883
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,030
I did, though.

884
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,390
It's on contact.

885
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,090
I did near its specific window on contact.

886
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,850
And something is wrong.

887
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:16,430
Cause it's... It's on... It's on contact.

888
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,490
Okay, maybe... Okay, I'm gonna start a save file.

889
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:32,870
And maybe if I'm on a particular... Maybe if I start on a save file... And then maybe...

890
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,670
Uh... Are you... Do you guys see that?

891
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,710
Do you do not?

892
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,670
I don't know.

893
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,010
Okay.

894
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,310
Oh, yeah, I should... I'll start the game.

895
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,050
Restart the game.

896
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,390
Okay, I even started the game...

897
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:51,190
I started the game on admin mode.

898
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,630
Alright, see, this is why I love stream... Okay, I love streaming this for you guys.

899
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,670
Because we get tech support together.

900
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,190
We can tech support this together, guys.

901
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,390
Um... Alright, let me try this again.

902
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,170
What the fuck?

903
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,690
I thought... Is it because I'm on a laptop?

904
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,930
Is it...

905
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,310
Is it... Is it the laptop?

906
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,490
Is it the... Is it a laptop issue?

907
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,330
Uh... I even started on the... I even did it in admin mode, too.

908
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,810
But it won't capture for some reason.

909
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:23,790
It's so weird.

910
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,350
Wait... Okay, let me in... Yes.

911
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:28,730
Alright.

912
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,930
How old?

913
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,730
It's not even that old.

914
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,550
It has a 4080.

915
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:34,910
Alright.

916
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,960
Alright, come on.

917
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,180
Yeah, we hear it.

918
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,140
We can all hear it go...

919
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,960
Oh my god, I'm gonna go fucking crazy.

920
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:57,640
Alright.

921
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,060
I'm gonna start it on normal.

922
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,300
Um...

923
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,220
Yeah, it's on... Yeah, I'm on game capture.

924
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,840
I tried window capture, but it captures my OBS as well.

925
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,980
And like, that's weird.

926
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,040
I...

927
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,300
It...

928
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,350
It captured...

929
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,490
Like...

930
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,900
I know!

931
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,940
It's so weird!

932
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,860
That's so weird!

933
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,480
Alright, alright, so what the fuck I just got here.

934
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:54,000
Okay, so all I see, it says chapter one, and then I have three empty slots, and then three empty slots, and it says like, uh, empty, empty, empty, empty, copy, erase, character select, Japanese, end program.

935
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,240
I like how I like it, just Japanese.

936
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,080
Oh my god, I don't understand.

937
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,200
Okay, alright, am I like, no, we're just trying to figure this out.

938
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,640
Try Japanese, just put it in Japanese, it'll fix everything.

939
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,300
I think, guys, I won't be able to read what's going on in my game.

940
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:30,080
Um, no, I did, I read the tech support chats, they were saying to put it on, uh, game capture, and I did.

941
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:46,140
I have it on admin mode, I have it on admin mode, I put it on game capture, I did contact for game capture, and then, um, and then, uh, I put admin mode on Deltarune as well, and like, it still is not working.

942
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,960
What the fuck is going on?

943
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,820
Why is it always me?

944
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,000
Why, why do I always get the tech support?

945
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:01,020
I, no, and then I, I saw that admin mode didn't work for Deltarune, so I put it back on normal.

946
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,680
Um, yes, I tried to put it in F4 as well.

947
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:14,260
Uh, yeah, I tried a game on non-admin mode, and everything, so, and then screen capture just captures my OBS as well.

948
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:29,780
I, I, I tried screen capture when I was, went offline, and it only captures my, um, it captures my OBS as well, so I thought that was fucking weird.

949
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:36,140
I, so I was like, okay, clearly, clearly that didn't work.

950
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:42,440
Um, all right, all right, anyway, maybe it really is the game.

951
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,820
Maybe this is the game.

952
00:39:49,240 --> 00:40:01,020
Have you tried, yeah, I captured, uh, I tried capturing, uh, other games before, and it worked okay, so, like, I don't know, maybe Deltarune just has, like, some thinking weird shit going.

953
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,300
Okay, let me see, okay, what do I have?

954
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,700
Oh, you know what I have downloaded?

955
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,940
We can, guys, all right, you guys want to know what I do have downloaded?

956
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,680
On my laptop.

957
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,800
Okay.

958
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:21,860
Guys, I do have something downloaded on my laptop that we could try out and see.

959
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,260
I have two games on my laptop, chat.

960
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,040
I just want you guys to know that I have two games on my laptop.

961
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,680
You guys, you guys want to guess what those two games are?

962
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:48,460
The two games on my laptop.

963
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,220
Don't worry, it's updating.

964
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,700
It's been, it's been a little bit.

965
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,940
Gee, I wonder what it is.

966
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,480
Because even though I am traveling, it doesn't...

967
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,800
No, the first game is Deltarune.

968
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,260
Why, you guys want to know what the second game is?

969
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,920
I have, the other game is Deltarune.

970
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,520
There's going to be a third game when I buy the nice day for fishing.

971
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,180
Give me a sec, I'm installing it right now.

972
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,140
Hmm, what could it be?

973
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,580
What could it be?

974
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,640
Alright, I'm booting it up.

975
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,560
Yes.

976
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:35,720
Alright.

977
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,140
You guys might be able to hear it before we see the...

978
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,100
It's a thinker, isn't it?

979
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,900
Ooh, what a riddle we have today.

980
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,420
What a nice riddle that we have.

981
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,920
What could it be?

982
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:51,580
Hmm.

983
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,140
Wait, where is it?

984
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,020
Wait, where is it?

985
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,540
Why is the game not popping up?

986
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,640
Excuse me?

987
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh, no.

988
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,800
Wait, we have some... Wait a minute.

989
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,960
Okay, we gotta fix this.

990
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,880
Oh, no.

991
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,240
Maybe it is my laptop.

992
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:07,900
Wait a minute.

993
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,020
Wait a minute.

994
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,460
Okay.

995
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,720
Please, I want to surprise my chat and be like, hee hee, this is what I have.

996
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,120
But wait a minute.

997
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,720
What the fuck is it?

998
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,360
Why isn't it launching?

999
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:21,900
Hello?

1000
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,280
Oh, man.

1001
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,340
Guys, I think there's other issues going on.

1002
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,920
Oh, it's installing something.

1003
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,880
Never mind, guys.

1004
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,420
It's okay.

1005
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,540
It's installing more things onto my laptop, apparently.

1006
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,280
Um, because I installed this yesterday.

1007
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,700
And then, like, um, apparently it wasn't finished installing.

1008
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,520
Um, they're like, right now we're running, we're installing Microsoft DirectX.

1009
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,820
And I was like, oh, okay.

1010
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:51,900
Okay.

1011
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,340
That's cool, I guess.

1012
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,360
To overwork that.

1013
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,620
Oh, my God.

1014
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,420
Um, ah, yes.

1015
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
The video game stream.

1016
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,420
Look, okay.

1017
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:14,380
Maybe, maybe I should have, maybe, uh, maybe I should have tested it out before I started to stream.

1018
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:20,260
But, like, I didn't think Deltarune was gonna be a little fucking bitch.

1019
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,100
I mean,

1020
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,280
like, can you really blame me?

1021
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,500
That it's being a little fucking bitch right now?

1022
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,280
Can you really blame me?

1023
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,260
I thought Deltarune would be one of the easiest games to stream.

1024
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,400
But, fuck me, I guess.

1025
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,440
I guess Toby Fox decided to add more things.

1026
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,600
The fuck with me.

1027
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,960
I, I, I thought, I thought it'd be an easy game.

1028
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,560
I'd be like, oh, look at that.

1029
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,340
Such a simple game for me to, for me to stream.

1030
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,860
Because I'm traveling right now.

1031
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,920
Whoa-wee.

1032
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,880
Well, fuck you, I guess.

1033
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,320
Fuck you, Doki.

1034
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,440
Guess you're not gonna be able to stream that game.

1035
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:13,420
But, whoa, I swear to God, if I am able to capture this game, that is definitely gonna be a surprise for everybody.

1036
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,140
Right now.

1037
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,080
I swear to fucking God.

1038
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:25,080
I, if I can capture this game, and not, and not Deltarune, I swear to fucking God.

1039
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,080
Oh, my God.

1040
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,920
Alright, let's see.

1041
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:28,840
Alright.

1042
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,620
Did this game decide to be like, whoa, look at that.

1043
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,500
Oh, my God!

1044
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,400
Look at that!

1045
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,860
Are you fucking kidding me?

1046
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,760
There's no way I can capture Marvel Rivals.

1047
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:52,320
Are you, are you fucking kidding me?

1048
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,800
I can capture Marvel Rivals, but I can't capture Deltarune?

1049
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,820
You gotta be fucking, I'm, I'm, I'm closing Marvel Rivals.

1050
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,060
I'm, guys, I'm closing Marvel Rivals, it's gonna take 20 years to compile the shaders.

1051
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,620
I, I cannot believe I can capture Marvel Rivals, but I can't capture Deltarune.

1052
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,760
Like, it's, what, what game is this?

1053
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,860
What, okay, I, I'm downloading chapter one on Itch.io.

1054
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:29,400
I swear, I swear, guys, simple problems require simple solutions.

1055
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,940
I'm downloading the game on Itch.io.

1056
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:41,520
I, I, I, I, I, I, no way that I'm doing, yeah, chapter one and two are already free on Itch.io.

1057
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,640
I'm gonna fucking download that.

1058
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,620
Uh, I'm dead.

1059
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,500
If it works, it works.

1060
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:57,460
Alright, okay, download chapter one, uh, delta rune.

1061
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,040
There we go, let me see.

1062
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,720
Alright, does anyone have the original chapter one installer?

1063
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,620
Alright, you can download it, I need, okay.

1064
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,080
Alright, I'm getting, oh wait, where is it?

1065
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,780
Where the fuck is it?

1066
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,220
Where the fuck is it?

1067
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:30,900
Wait, someone says, wait, does someone give, look for, and lower it to... Okay, if it works, it works, guys.

1068
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,820
Alright, let's see.

1069
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:55,860
Uh... No, I can't do screen capture, because screen capture shows my OBS for some, it like, cuts, like, only half the game shows up, only half the game shows up, and like, my OBS, uh, my OBS is like, uh, um, covers up half the game for some fucking reason.

1070
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,060
Oh, I can't download them anymore?

1071
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:58,980
No!

1072
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,700
No way!

1073
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,080
Wait, no, delta rune, okay, there we go, will be released on Steam.

1074
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,500
There we go, download...

1075
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,180
Oh, okay, there we go, it's on Itch.io, there we go, I'm downloading the Itch.io version.

1076
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,280
I'm...

1077
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,340
How are you gonna play chapter three and four?

1078
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,740
I will watch my own stream, and replay it, so we get to the part.

1079
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:21,620
We...

1080
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:31,300
I will... I will tell... I will watch my own stream, replay it on the Steam version, and so we can re...

1081
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,800
So we can have, like, an almost accurate version.

1082
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,420
Like, we... No, that is how we're gonna do... That's so much work.

1083
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:45,280
Well, fuck me for trying to fucking go... go somewhere to... to work on my concert.

1084
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:45,400
Alright.

1085
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,700
Fuck me for trying to, like, make a good concert, I guess.

1086
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,100
That's my fault.

1087
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,360
Alright.

1088
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,760
Deltarune.

1089
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:57,500
Alright.

1090
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:01,880
Yeah, I should never leave my... This is what happens when you leave your house, guys.

1091
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,060
Never travel!

1092
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,440
Never leave your home!

1093
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,240
I swear to God, if this works.

1094
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,020
I swear to fucking God, if this works.

1095
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,380
Oh my God.

1096
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,200
I would be, uh, so mad.

1097
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,660
And happy at the same time.

1098
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:17,920
Alright, here we go.

1099
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,580
Let's try this again, guys.

1100
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,720
Let's fucking... Alright.

1101
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,940
Let's try this again.

1102
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,400
I swear to God.

1103
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,520
I... I swear... Oh my God.

1104
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,360
I swear to fucking God.

1105
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,440
You cannot do this to me.

1106
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,200
I... Did it just boot up from...

1107
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,100
Oh my God.

1108
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:42,580
I swear.

1109
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:48,400
If he, like... If this just came from the... Okay, I'm gonna uninstall this... Okay, wait.

1110
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,000
I got an idea.

1111
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,040
I got an idea.

1112
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,280
I got a fucking idea.

1113
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,580
Okay.

1114
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:51,660
Okay.

1115
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,340
Chapter 1 Windows.

1116
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,350
Okay.

1117
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,670
Delta Rune version 3.

1118
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:05,670
Wait a minute.

1119
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:06,370
Okay, wait.

1120
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,790
I'm gonna... What version is this Delta Rune?

1121
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:09,830
What version?

1122
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,310
Okay, this is version 1 14.

1123
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,570
14?!

1124
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,950
How many versions?

1125
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,350
What?

1126
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,370
Why is there so many versions?

1127
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:19,410
Okay.

1128
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:20,370
Alright.

1129
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:21,870
Jesus Christ.

1130
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,050
Okay, Toby.

1131
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:23,850
Okay.

1132
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:24,270
Alright.

1133
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:25,250
Okay.

1134
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,750
Run as administrator.

1135
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,190
Okay.

1136
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:28,330
Alright.

1137
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,110
Version 3.

1138
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,790
I have version 3 right now.

1139
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,570
That's a lot of Delta Runes.

1140
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,010
It is.

1141
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,550
I was not ready for that many Delta Runes.

1142
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:36,910
Okay.

1143
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:37,830
Alright.

1144
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:38,470
Let's see.

1145
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:38,550
Toby.

1146
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,590
I swear to God.

1147
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:40,010
Toby.

1148
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:40,330
Please.

1149
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,310
I... Download your Itch.io version.

1150
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,110
I... Swear.

1151
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,010
Are you there?

1152
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:45,370
Okay.

1153
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:45,810
Yes.

1154
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:48,250
But, like, are... Can you please be on my screen, too?

1155
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,310
Can you... Like, that's all I ask of you?

1156
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,870
Can you also be on my screen?

1157
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,630
Like... I'm gonna go crazy.

1158
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,410
Like... Oh my God.

1159
00:49:59,470 --> 00:49:59,630
Wait.

1160
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:00,110
Your start?

1161
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:00,430
Okay.

1162
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:01,490
Alright.

1163
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,030
Please.

1164
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:02,870
Stop talking.

1165
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:03,370
Okay.

1166
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:06,890
Uh...

1167
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:09,310
Uh...

1168
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:13,710
Uh...

1169
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,390
It's not the laptop's fault.

1170
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:19,290
I can play... I can stream Marvel Rivals on my laptop.

1171
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:23,730
Why can I not stream this fucking... Do you know how big a file this game is?

1172
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:25,130
Like, I don't understand.

1173
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,670
Marvel Rivals was, like, 60 gigabytes.

1174
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,410
You know how big this game was?

1175
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:36,050
This game... This game... This game was, like... Okay.

1176
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:36,590
Uh-uh.

1177
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,670
What's the fucking property size of this?

1178
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,150
This game was, like, 200... There's no way.

1179
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,170
This game was 900 and... Oh my God.

1180
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,190
How many... Okay.

1181
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,090
I can't even tell.

1182
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:47,950
I...

1183
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,630
This game is 580 megabytes.

1184
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,890
This is 580 megabytes.

1185
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,990
There's no fucking way.

1186
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:56,530
Okay.

1187
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,370
Alright.

1188
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,390
Do you guys see this game?

1189
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,210
Do you guys see this?

1190
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,550
I can't see chat.

1191
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,270
Because I'm full screen.

1192
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:10,190
No.

1193
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:10,910
Okay.

1194
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:12,110
It's not me.

1195
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,390
It's not me.

1196
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:14,850
It's... It's Toby.

1197
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:15,990
Yeah.

1198
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,470
We're on first name basis because that's how angry I am.

1199
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:23,650
That's... That's... That's...

1200
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,130
Okay.

1201
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,150
Alright.

1202
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,030
Okay.

1203
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,590
So...

1204
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,930
That didn't work.

1205
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,310
Okay.

1206
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,250
I have an idea.

1207
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:34,630
Guys.

1208
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,590
I have an idea.

1209
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,530
Okay.

1210
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:39,610
Okay.

1211
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,630
OBS won't...

1212
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:44,830
Won't...

1213
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:45,510
Capture...

1214
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:46,730
Deltarune.

1215
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:48,590
And that...

1216
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:49,930
Does not work...

1217
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:50,290
With...

1218
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:50,650
Deltarune.

1219
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,090
My idea is Googling.

1220
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,050
Um...

1221
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,110
At...

1222
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:02,550
At...

1223
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,090
At...

1224
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:03,910
At...

1225
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:03,950
At...

1226
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:04,010
At...

1227
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:04,110
At...

1228
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:04,150
At...

1229
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,710
Alright.

1230
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,450
Okay.

1231
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,590
Okay.

1232
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,050
So apparently everyone was like...

1233
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,030
And reopening OBS often fix...

1234
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,150
Both don't work.

1235
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,190
And closing and reopening also doesn't work.

1236
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:19,750
Okay.

1237
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:23,410
Okay, that's not very helpful.

1238
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,670
Okay, apparently, this is an issue.

1239
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,830
This is an issue.

1240
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:37,090
Oh, okay, I have to disable hardware... where the fuck do I have hardware acceleration on?

1241
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:38,510
Like, excuse me?

1242
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,550
Close Discord?

1243
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,730
Okay, like, what is this?

1244
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:46,910
Why is there, like, a whole step-by-step guide on how...

1245
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:54,630
Guys, look at this step-by-step guide on everything, on how...

1246
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,790
Like, okay, look at this.

1247
00:52:55,850 --> 00:53:00,890
It was like, here are some ways to make sure you can capture a game...

1248
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,810
obvious game capture even when ran as administrator.

1249
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:04,250
Okay.

1250
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:07,210
Alright, so it's not me.

1251
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,930
It's just Deltarune.

1252
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:10,610
Okay.

1253
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,510
Try... ensure... okay, game capture and see if that works.

1254
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,230
It came to try window... okay, we're not doing window capture.

1255
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,750
That's... bit stupid for me to do.

1256
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:28,470
That is... that would be an issue if I do window capture.

1257
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:31,730
That is a little bit scary, especially when I'm on a laptop.

1258
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:34,530
I do not... whatever is that.

1259
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,530
This can't be my fault.

1260
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:41,650
I swear to God.

1261
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,170
It... I can... I... okay, guys.

1262
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:46,310
I will prove to you that it is not my fault.

1263
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:51,470
I will... I can stream any... okay, I'll show you why I know it's not my fault.

1264
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:58,810
Because if I do... if I do... Super Mario Mon and I swear to God...

1265
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:02,110
Like... my OPS would be like, oh, hey, I see you.

1266
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:05,850
Look at that.

1267
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,150
Do you see that?

1268
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:11,370
Do you... do you see that?

1269
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,430
Look at that!

1270
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,710
Wait, you don't see it?

1271
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:19,390
Okay, wait, do you see it now?

1272
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,970
Do you... do you see it now?

1273
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,230
Guys, do you see it now?

1274
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:25,470
Wait, there's no ga- okay.

1275
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:33,530
Wait, okay, I... I can't see it because Deltarune fucked up my screen, so I don't see anything.

1276
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:44,910
Deltarune fucked up my screen, so like, I can't even... oh, oh, I can see it now.

1277
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:45,810
Okay, it's okay.

1278
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:46,770
I can see it now.

1279
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:47,910
Okay, watch this.

1280
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,270
Okay, wait for it.

1281
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,690
Guys, wait for it.

1282
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:56,290
Okay.

1283
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:59,710
Give me a sec.

1284
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,110
Okay, give me a sec, guys.

1285
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,510
Give me a sec.

1286
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:11,550
I figured it.

1287
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:12,550
Give me a sec, guys.

1288
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:13,830
Give me a sec.

1289
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,430
Give me a sec.

1290
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,230
It's gonna work.

1291
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,130
Okay, look, you see this?

1292
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,950
It's like mega cropped out because I'm...

1293
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:24,150
Look!

1294
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:24,670
See?

1295
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:25,330
See?

1296
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,110
This works!

1297
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:31,150
Look at that!

1298
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,630
It works!

1299
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,070
This works!

1300
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:38,930
So why the fuck does Deltarune not work?

1301
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,830
Okay, I figured I know what to do.

1302
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,590
Okay, I know what to do.

1303
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,550
All right.

1304
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,550
Okay, I think I know what to do.

1305
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:47,970
I know what to do.

1306
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:49,090
All right.

1307
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,950
Why does it capture my OBS?

1308
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:00,430
Deltarune!

1309
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,110
Oh my god, if I wasn't on one monitor, it would be fine.

1310
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:06,290
I am not...

1311
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,510
I'm on one monitor!

1312
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,530
I don't want you to capture my OBS!

1313
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:27,690
I don't

1314
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,370
want you to capture my OBS!

1315
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:37,410
Okay.

1316
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:38,370
Dave.

1317
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,770
Guys, we gotta pivot.

1318
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,170
We gotta...

1319
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:44,810
All right.

1320
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:46,850
Let me pay for this game real quick.

1321
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,590
We gotta...

1322
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:49,930
Let me buy this game real quick.

1323
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,450
We're gonna pivot right now.

1324
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,590
Oh, wait!

1325
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:54,590
Okay, you're right.

1326
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:55,170
All right.

1327
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,930
You're right.

1328
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:57,430
You're right.

1329
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,070
I'm installing another game.

1330
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:02,130
I'm...

1331
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,190
We're pivoting.

1332
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:03,750
Guys.

1333
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:04,590
I'll...

1334
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,610
I'll fix it later.

1335
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:06,690
I'm gonna...

1336
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,410
I'll fix it later.

1337
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:11,510
Oh, wait.

1338
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,990
Okay.

1339
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,230
Okay.

1340
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:14,310
It's okay.

1341
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:15,950
Everything is okay.

1342
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:17,010
Don't worry.

1343
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,550
Everything is okay.

1344
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:20,870
Oh my god.

1345
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,650
Maybe not.

1346
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,360
Oh.

1347
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,020
Oh shit.

1348
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:32,340
Okay.

1349
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,480
Everything is okay.

1350
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:33,580
Okay.

1351
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,040
Again.

1352
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,400
Everything...

1353
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,320
Everything is okay.

1354
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,000
Okay.

1355
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,520
Just give me a sec.

1356
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,700
We're 50% done.

1357
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,980
Everything will be fine.

1358
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,550
Let me...

1359
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,700
You guys are gonna find out what we're pivoting very soon.

1360
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,640
Apparently, we're not playing...

1361
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,720
We're not playing Deltarune today.

1362
00:57:59,270 --> 00:57:59,900
It's fine.

1363
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,600
It's fine.

1364
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,060
My computer...

1365
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,540
My laptop is like...

1366
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:03,880
You know what?

1367
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,400
Fuck you.

1368
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,300
But that's okay.

1369
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,880
That means we can start Deltarune next week!

1370
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:08,280
Guys!

1371
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,340
Yippee!

1372
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,560
We can...

1373
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:13,960
Alright.

1374
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:14,840
There we go.

1375
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,040
I finished installing it.

1376
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:16,780
Yes.

1377
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,400
Alright.

1378
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,760
This is fine.

1379
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,760
I have to install this game.

1380
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,460
Now I have three games on my laptop.

1381
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,740
If any...

1382
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,580
If any...

1383
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,100
If any...

1384
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:28,920
If any...

1385
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,680
If everything fails...

1386
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,920
I have one good old reliable here!

1387
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,710
If everything fails...

1388
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:42,030
I have...

1389
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:44,970
Good old reliable bloons!

1390
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,930
Bloons.

1391
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:54,930
T.D.

1392
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,450
I don't remember what it's called.

1393
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:58,870
T.J.K.

1394
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:00,450
J.K.

1395
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,530
Wee Blooning.

1396
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,530
All right.

1397
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:09,750
Let's go.

1398
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,350
All right.

1399
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,070
I can't have this full screen, though.

1400
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:14,110
Oh, my God.

1401
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:14,450
Okay.

1402
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:15,450
We have to do this.

1403
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:15,950
Okay.

1404
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:18,510
All right.

1405
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:19,150
That's fine.

1406
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:21,710
Let's see.

1407
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:25,330
That's fine.

1408
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:26,110
All right.

1409
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:28,070
We can do this again.

1410
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:28,990
It's fine.

1411
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,950
We just gotta get through the tutorial.

1412
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:34,870
Here.

1413
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,190
Put more dart monkeys.

1414
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,910
I don't care.

1415
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:37,430
Let's go.

1416
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,490
There we go.

1417
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:41,930
We're starting.

1418
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:41,950
All right.

1419
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:42,550
That's fine.

1420
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,170
This is all calculated.

1421
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:45,830
Return.

1422
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,630
All right.

1423
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:51,350
That's fine.

1424
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,190
Everything is fine.

1425
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:55,750
It's okay.

1426
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:56,910
All right.

1427
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:57,330
Let's see.

1428
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:58,030
Auto start.

1429
00:59:58,990 --> 00:59:59,150
Okay.

1430
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,430
Oh, my God.

1431
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:11,770
Please.

1432
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,590
I'm already going through so much.

1433
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:14,770
Don't do this to me.

1434
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,570
I don't care.

1435
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,930
Just... I don't care.

1436
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,370
I'm going through so much right now.

1437
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,650
Please don't...

1438
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,590
changing the graphics settings to high performance.

1439
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:36,470
Oh, my God.

1440
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:36,930
Okay.

1441
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:38,150
All right.

1442
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:39,210
Goodbye, bloons.

1443
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:39,870
All right.

1444
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,830
I'll do one more.

1445
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,210
I'll do one more fix and see if that works.

1446
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:44,590
Okay.

1447
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,110
NVIDIA.

1448
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:47,650
All right.

1449
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:49,730
No, do not.

1450
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,530
Guys.

1451
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,270
I can't access my NVIDIA settings.

1452
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,230
All right.

1453
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:04,530
NVIDIA.

1454
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:04,830
Oh, wait.

1455
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:05,110
I can.

1456
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,370
NVIDIA control panel.

1457
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:07,190
There you go.

1458
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:08,190
Agree and continue.

1459
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:09,030
Oh, hey.

1460
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:11,070
I agree and continue for the first time.

1461
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:11,990
All right.

1462
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,510
All right.

1463
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:15,550
All right.

1464
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:17,170
Okay.

1465
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,970
High perform... Where's my NVIDIA?

1466
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:20,210
All right.

1467
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:21,730
High performance.

1468
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:24,970
Adjust... Where is that, anyway?

1469
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:26,250
Video settings?

1470
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,510
Where the fuck is high performance?

1471
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:32,890
Okay.

1472
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,290
Use my preferred...

1473
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:34,730
Wait.

1474
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:35,470
Where is that?

1475
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,570
Oh, my God.

1476
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,510
What is that?

1477
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:45,990
Where the fuck is high performance?

1478
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:46,970
I...

1479
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:50,430
Okay.

1480
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:51,610
Manage 3 settings.

1481
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:52,830
Power settings.

1482
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:54,730
Power.

1483
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,730
Where the fuck is power?

1484
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,930
Oh, my God.

1485
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,630
Everything is all over the place.

1486
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,210
Power management mode.

1487
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:03,510
Okay.

1488
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:03,950
Not that.

1489
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,490
Is it the...

1490
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:06,750
NVIDIA control panel?

1491
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,570
Oh, it's been moved to a...

1492
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:10,850
Win...

1493
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:11,450
Wait.

1494
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:12,650
No.

1495
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:13,550
Don't apply it.

1496
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,070
Okay.

1497
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:17,910
NVIDIA...

1498
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,150
Is it in the control panel?

1499
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,150
Yes.

1500
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,270
Okay.

1501
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:22,550
No.

1502
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,450
It's part of Windows?

1503
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:25,070
Windows.

1504
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,220
I swear to God.

1505
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,580
We're just gonna create our character and we end the stream.

1506
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,140
That's, like, literally it.

1507
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:37,460
Okay.

1508
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,280
Control panel.

1509
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,700
Power settings.

1510
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:46,830
Okay.

1511
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,510
Power action settings?

1512
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,510
Is that it?

1513
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,050
Power mode?

1514
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:56,870
No.

1515
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:58,250
Okay.

1516
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:00,150
Wait.

1517
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,910
Where is it?

1518
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:03,330
I'm on...

1519
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,050
I'm on Windows settings?

1520
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,650
And then...

1521
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,090
And then...

1522
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:09,890
And then what?

1523
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:11,890
Try type...

1524
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:12,470
Graphic settings.

1525
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:12,730
Okay.

1526
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,110
Graphic...

1527
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:14,210
Oh.

1528
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:15,090
Graphic settings.

1529
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:15,490
Okay.

1530
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:16,890
Graphic settings.

1531
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,710
Now, where the fuck is...

1532
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,870
Oh, advanced graphics settings.

1533
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:20,550
Okay.

1534
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:23,370
It has hardware accelerated GPU scheduling.

1535
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:24,990
Where the fuck is the other thing?

1536
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:30,930
Systems display...

1537
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:32,230
Graphics.

1538
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:32,870
Oh.

1539
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:33,630
System...

1540
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:33,770
Okay.

1541
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:34,890
Add game.

1542
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:36,950
Delta...

1543
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:37,090
Okay.

1544
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:38,010
Add...

1545
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:39,850
Add a desktop app.

1546
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,710
Where the fuck are you, Delta Root?

1547
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:43,490
Where did...

1548
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:43,770
Okay.

1549
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,410
I'm gonna do this one.

1550
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:45,670
Okay.

1551
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:46,470
Delta Root.

1552
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,130
And then...

1553
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,230
High performance.

1554
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:51,270
Okay.

1555
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:53,310
Okay.

1556
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,210
High performance.

1557
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:54,770
All right.

1558
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,390
If this doesn't work...

1559
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,910
If...

1560
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:57,690
I swear to God.

1561
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,230
If this doesn't work...

1562
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,490
Remember who...

1563
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:02,870
Who took away your Bloons gameplay.

1564
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:04,050
Remember...

1565
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:07,850
Remember...

1566
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:09,610
Who took that away from you.

1567
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:15,310
Because that's their fault.

1568
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,010
Because they gave us...

1569
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:19,190
Oh!

1570
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:24,830
Okay.

1571
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:25,790
Let me...

1572
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:26,710
We're back.

1573
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:27,450
Back out.

1574
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:29,970
Delta Root.

1575
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:30,890
JK.

1576
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,530
We figured it out.

1577
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:36,610
Skip.

1578
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:38,470
One hour.

1579
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:40,670
Of text support.

1580
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:43,630
There we go.

1581
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:46,130
All right.

1582
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:47,450
By the way.

1583
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:48,530
This is the one...

1584
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:49,390
This is the one...

1585
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,870
What I download from Itch.io.

1586
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:51,330
By the way.

1587
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:52,510
This is the Itch.io download.

1588
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:53,650
I'm not trying...

1589
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,710
I'm not gonna try and figure out where the Steam version is.

1590
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:56,270
I'm...

1591
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:58,210
I'm gonna use the...

1592
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:00,190
I'm using the Itch.io version.

1593
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:00,850
I...

1594
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,390
I cannot be bothered.

1595
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:04,430
I cannot be bothered.

1596
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,710
I will...

1597
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,250
I will replay this.

1598
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:09,750
This is...

1599
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,450
This is the Itch.io version.

1600
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:12,630
I cannot be bothered.

1601
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,590
I don't want to test my luck.

1602
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:17,290
Why is it green?

1603
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:19,610
Because it's supposed to be green.

1604
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:20,530
It's...

1605
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,350
Just fix this.

1606
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:23,290
Okay, fine.

1607
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:24,450
I'll fix the Steam one.

1608
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:25,070
Okay.

1609
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:25,690
All right.

1610
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:26,370
Okay.

1611
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:26,890
I'll fix...

1612
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:27,430
I swear to God.

1613
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,850
Remember who took this away from you if it doesn't work.

1614
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:32,150
If I fuck it up.

1615
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:33,170
Remember me.

1616
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:34,290
Okay.

1617
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:35,390
All right.

1618
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:37,070
Okay.

1619
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:37,470
Let's see.

1620
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:38,490
I can't believe it.

1621
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,710
I'm uninstalling bloons.

1622
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:42,190
All right.

1623
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:45,290
Browse local files.

1624
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:45,970
All right.

1625
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:46,670
Here we go.

1626
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:47,890
This should be it.

1627
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:48,970
Okay.

1628
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,440
All right.

1629
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,340
Is that the right one?

1630
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,000
Let window...

1631
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,100
Okay.

1632
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:58,560
There we go.

1633
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,240
And then...

1634
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:02,880
Okay.

1635
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:03,580
There we go.

1636
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:05,880
We did it, guys.

1637
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,020
We figured it out.

1638
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,060
Oh, my God.

1639
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,220
I did it.

1640
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,900
What do you know what I mean?

1641
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:11,620
I...

1642
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,560
Oh, my God.

1643
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:15,220
I did it.

1644
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,260
Oh, my God.

1645
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,540
I'm a fucking genius.

1646
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:17,980
All right.

1647
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:18,400
There we go.

1648
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,340
Oh, my God.

1649
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:19,880
We did it.

1650
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:21,520
We actually did it.

1651
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:22,260
All right.

1652
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,520
VOD watchers.

1653
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,040
Skip one hour.

1654
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,400
Are you...

1655
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,500
there?

1656
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,880
What if I just create my character and I just end stream?

1657
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:33,940
I...

1658
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:36,340
Can we...

1659
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,020
Are we connected?

1660
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:44,020
Wait.

1661
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,140
Some guy.

1662
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:45,940
Are you here?

1663
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,440
We went through all of that.

1664
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,820
I create my character.

1665
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,940
I'm like, that was a great Delta Rune stream.

1666
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,100
Now.

1667
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:02,540
We may begin.

1668
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,860
First, you must...
