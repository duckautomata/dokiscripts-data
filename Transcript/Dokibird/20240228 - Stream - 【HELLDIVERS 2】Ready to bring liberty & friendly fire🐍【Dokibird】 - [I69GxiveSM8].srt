1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,880
We're live!

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,280
Man, fuck this shit.

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,960
We're live!

4
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,160
No, fuck you!

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,900
Oh my god, Zeller.

6
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,660
Bro, how do I, how do I fucking, how do I, how do I- We're live!

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,260
We're live!

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,040
How do I skip the tutorial on this shit, man?

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,140
Fuck this shit, bro.

10
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,680
I'm so, I'm so done.

11
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,780
Wait, just like that we're live?

12
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,380
Yeah, just like that we're live!

13
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,360
Yes, we said no waiting room.

14
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,900
We're live.

15
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,280
Everything's live now.

16
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,800
Alright, how are we gonna start the story of why RPR is late?

17
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,200
I don't know.

18
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:29,580
I don't know.

19
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:29,920
I don't know.

20
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,020
So RPR couldn't get the store preference- Bro, shut up!

21
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,060
Wait, my OBS is fucked.

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,360
Wait, what?

23
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,320
Are you streaming your POV as well?

24
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,560
What, am I not allowed to or what?

25
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,060
No, you are but I'm just surprised you are!

26
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,920
Okay, so, so we had a lot of issues getting Zeller the game.

27
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,880
We had a lot of issues with that.

28
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,380
Yeah, no!

29
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,680
I had it all prepared!

30
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,320
You were not prepared, okay?

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,880
Come on guys, back me up on this.

32
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,280
I was prepared, right?

33
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:04,940
You were not prepared.

34
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,580
No, I was!

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,800
And then technical difficulties...

36
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,560
10 minutes before we were supposed to start, you were like, I just finished the tutorial.

37
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,480
No, that was 30 minutes before the stream.

38
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,600
Please be... please.

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
He did sound all like happy.

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,320
Like, oh I finished the tutorial guys.

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,040
Yes!

42
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,360
That's what I'm saying.

43
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,160
And then suddenly, you know, had some technical difficulties.

44
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,980
So I was like, oh shit!

45
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,140
I need to re-download the game, right?

46
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,640
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,160
And then, yeah, but then I apparently had to buy it again and stuff.

48
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,180
And then, uh, store preferences and vision lock and all that.

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,480
So I ended up spending like $200 trying to buy this game and get it again.

50
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:53,840
Yeah.

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,720
It did not work.

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,860
He tried to buy a Steam gift card and it didn't work either.

53
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:57,860
Yeah, exactly.

54
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,620
It didn't work.

55
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
Steam lost him out from buying it after that.

56
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,360
Yep.

57
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,420
He's like, you've been trying to purchase too many times.

58
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,080
You can't buy nothing.

59
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,880
So I was like, what the fuck am I gonna do?

60
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,780
So then finally I had to take it into my hands and then I actually made an entire email address, new account.

61
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,680
I purchased it on that account.

62
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,280
And then finally we were able to play.

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
How did you do it?

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,860
For God I Slave, thank God you exist.

65
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,020
Bro.

66
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,640
And then Han named it, Zeller is stupid.

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,280
NFC account.

68
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,720
What, you gonna look at me and tell me that I'm wrong?

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,300
Am I wrong?

70
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,400
You're not right!

71
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,980
You're not right!

72
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,020
Alright, how do we play this shit, guys?

73
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,540
What do we do?

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,660
Steam code.

75
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,280
Give me a Steam code.

76
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,300
Oh yeah, the Steam code.

77
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,420
Right, cause this is a brand new fucking account we have to make after all that stupid shit.

78
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,260
We have to fucking go through.

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,100
I can't handle you guys anymore.

80
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,880
You owe me dinner tonight, okay?

81
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,560
It's not my fault, man!

82
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,320
Probably two times, cause it was expensive.

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,320
Alright guys, I just need you guys to know, this is Zeller while more tamed than what he was off-stream.

84
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,500
Yeah, let's just say a couple guns would be handed out if you...

85
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,540
Just so you guys know, this is Zeller while he's restrained right now.

86
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,980
Oh yeah, you know me.

87
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,320
You know how it is.

88
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,080
All I'm saying is you're paying for dinner, bro.

89
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,720
I don't give a fuck.

90
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,520
Fuck off!

91
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,800
What did you do, man?

92
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,600
You did nothing!

93
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,580
I don't fuck the fucking fault for you!

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
I know you didn't.

95
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,860
He took the fault for you for like 30 minutes.

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
What is this guy talking about, bro?

97
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,840
I'm gonna go live too.

98
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,000
I just...

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
Wait, you weren't live?

100
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,960
You weren't live?

101
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,580
What happened?

102
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,400
My OBS reset.

103
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,820
I guess we got tired of listening to your stupid ass.

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,480
You guys sent a friend?

105
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:51,920
Yeah.

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,540
I think RPR is the lobby leader, so...

107
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,420
Yeah, no, you can even just join via like friends list.

108
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,300
Cause that's what I did.

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,660
Alright, let me add to...

110
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,440
Now I have like three Zeller accounts on here.

111
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,560
Yeah!

112
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,020
No problem!

113
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,100
The fact that he named all of them Zeller too.

114
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,420
Zeller, Zeller, Zeller.

115
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,460
Yeah, cold fuckers.

116
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,640
Cause they're all new accounts, bro.

117
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,660
He's the sus one.

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,560
Okay, I'm going live.

119
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,880
Alright, what do I do?

120
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,080
How do I join via friend list?

121
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,080
You just like go to the friends and then do join game.

122
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,620
Socials, this one.

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,620
Ah, friends.

124
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,160
You got this, buddy.

125
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,520
I have zero friends.

126
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,780
What the fuck, man?

127
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,120
What do you mean?

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,020
We all had it too.

129
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,100
How do I... Oh, this one.

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,640
Join squad.

131
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,340
Nice!

132
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,900
Let's go!

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,180
We're doing it!

134
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,480
Yeah!

135
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,500
Fucking hell.

136
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,080
Alright, my cam is... My cam is on and I'm not bald.

137
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,340
There we go.

138
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,160
We could be a wig.

139
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,860
Bro!

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
You could have got a wig.

141
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,620
Bro, bro.

142
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,380
Let's go to like...

143
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,500
Bro, you're open voice, bro.

144
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,040
You're open voice.

145
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Are we not gonna use open voice?

146
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,100
Let's use open voice, it'll be funnier.

147
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:12,780
Bro, it's the same thing.

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,260
There's no proximity chat.

149
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,280
It'll be funnier.

150
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,060
It'll be funnier.

151
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,020
No proximity chat.

152
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm gonna get kicked out.

153
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,900
Well, that's your fucking problem, bro.

154
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,600
You're my problem, man.

155
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,400
You're my problem.

156
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,920
Well, sucks to be you, dickhead.

157
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,540
Helldivers doesn't even have proximity voice.

158
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,240
We can all hear each other regardless.

159
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:29,900
What?

160
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,200
Okay, that's shit.

161
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,640
Yeah!

162
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,960
How do we turn it off then?

163
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,180
How do we turn this shit off?

164
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
Options, is it?

165
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,220
Audio?

166
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,780
Voice chat?

167
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,780
This one.

168
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,560
Disabled.

169
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,860
Bro, guys.

170
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,760
RPR is a super citizen.

171
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,040
He actually paid for this.

172
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,420
He actually paid for this game more than it should be.

173
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,760
Look at this guy.

174
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,860
Look at this guy.

175
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,460
What the fuck?

176
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,680
He was like flexing his paid cosmetics to us.

177
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,580
Oh yeah, guess what?

178
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,760
I paid $200 for this fucking game.

179
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,140
Yeah, we're his paid cosmetics.

180
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,060
RPR, I'm a free player.

181
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,040
Can you buy for me too?

182
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,900
Yeah, can you buy for us?

183
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Yeah, look at us.

184
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,820
Look at my army.

185
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm just a baby.

186
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,660
I just spent $40 bucks for Zeller.

187
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,080
Like, how looks... like...

188
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,320
How do you guys do these emotes?

189
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,020
Did your clothes hurt?

190
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,100
It's B.

191
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,400
How do you guys do emotes and shit, bro?

192
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,560
You were in the tutorial.

193
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
What do you mean?

194
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
Uh, what tutorial?

195
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,560
I skipped it.

196
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,620
You were in two tutorials.

197
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,120
It's B.

198
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,240
Alright, let's go kill some bugs, guys.

199
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,240
I wanna shoot them up.

200
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:30,620
Let's do the robots.

201
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,240
Yeah.

202
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,180
No, we should... actually, no.

203
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,980
Let's not do the robots.

204
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,460
I feel like Zeller's gonna kill us.

205
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,060
Robots?

206
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,820
No, no, no.

207
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,320
There's no robots in this game.

208
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,220
There's no robots.

209
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,800
Bro, dude, dude, dude.

210
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,720
Trust me, yo.

211
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,020
Robots and... like me?

212
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,620
It's like a duo, yo.

213
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,020
Dynamite.

214
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,080
It's like... it's like sandwich and mayonnaise.

215
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,340
I'm the mayonnaise.

216
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,520
You're doing...

217
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,520
There's no one liberating this planet.

218
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,460
You're doing wonderful, buddy.

219
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,100
You're doing wonderful.

220
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,320
He's doing great.

221
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,140
I'm liberating right now.

222
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,200
Bro, bro, bro, bro.

223
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,520
Come back.

224
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,720
Got me up, homie.

225
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,920
Galactic wheelchair.

226
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,380
Got me up, homie.

227
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,640
We got this.

228
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,960
What are we doing, RPR?

229
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,640
Which way?

230
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,660
Wait, my mic is wrong.

231
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,300
Here.

232
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,520
Thanks.

233
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,040
Yeah.

234
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,600
Where are we going, RPR?

235
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,300
Where are we going?

236
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,020
I didn't mean to hit you.

237
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,760
Who are we liberating?

238
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,220
Let's ult and win a new game.

239
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,900
My mic is way too dank.

240
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,020
We're going Erato Prime.

241
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,740
Dank?

242
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,400
Ooh.

243
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,220
Ooh.

244
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,920
We're going level nine?

245
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,640
Level nine?

246
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

247
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,280
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

248
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

249
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

250
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,180
Zeller's a fucking baby.

251
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,780
No, I'm not.

252
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,900
You're also a baby.

253
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,980
I am a preteen right now.

254
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,420
Excuse me?

255
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,100
Excuse you, I'm preteen.

256
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,840
Gosh, in my preteens, I was playing Neopets.

257
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,960
Oh shit!

258
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,160
Neopets Adventure Quest Club Penguin.

259
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,420
Club Penguin!

260
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,720
That shit was fire.

261
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,200
I was a waiter in the pizzeria.

262
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,040
Dude, the pizzeria.

263
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,600
They were like these little fucking fluff balls, remember?

264
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,680
Puffballs!

265
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,880
Yeah, whatever they're called.

266
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,600
I was ruining the dates at the pizzeria.

267
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,220
The fucking snowboarding shit.

268
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,800
Hey pizzeria, what did this kid play?

269
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,960
He can only do like baby level.

270
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,040
Remember the dojo card game that they had?

271
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,340
I remember the fucking sled races.

272
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,200
No, it was sled races and there was this dojo fucking card game you could play.

273
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,960
I forgot what it was called.

274
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,640
It's called, I don't know.

275
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,400
Karjutsu?

276
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,680
What's a karjutsu?

277
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,240
Karjutsu?

278
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,860
I don't know.

279
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,820
And then there was like, you can be like a secret agent too.

280
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,020
I was golden at the game bro.

281
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,300
Yeah.

282
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,260
Secret agent.

283
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,900
Dude, RPR is too old.

284
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,840
He doesn't know this kind of stuff.

285
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,760
Yeah, he is.

286
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,760
He doesn't relate to us.

287
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,820
He's not listening to you guys.

288
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,240
He used to play like fucking Tetris and shit, man.

289
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,300
I don't give a shit about games.

290
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,380
He was playing Second Life while we were playing Club Penguin.

291
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,980
He was a fucking Tetris guy.

292
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,820
Getting the fucking hell putt, bro, man.

293
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,700
Bro, I'm getting in.

294
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,860
Oh, I got this one.

295
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,580
I got the all the way to the top.

296
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,240
To the right side.

297
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,880
I'm trying to get us in the game and they're just flaming me.

298
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,100
What the fuck is this?

299
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,000
All right, we pick our gear.

300
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,340
Okay.

301
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,120
I'll take an autocannon.

302
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,600
All right, I only have three stratagems.

303
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,460
What the fuck?

304
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,120
I have offensive, supply.

305
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,660
What the fuck?

306
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:32,900
Huh?

307
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,140
None of you...

308
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,180
I go with the supply then.

309
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,600
Fuck it.

310
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,900
I'll take a health pot.

311
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,260
Oh, wait.

312
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,660
I have two.

313
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,520
I have two.

314
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,180
I'm readied.

315
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,140
Sounds good.

316
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:43,880
Okay.

317
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,420
Ready?

318
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,120
I don't know what...

319
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,140
It's all right.

320
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,540
RPR and Han can carry us.

321
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,960
They have the actual good stratagems.

322
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,000
No, come on.

323
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,880
We're a team.

324
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,740
We're a team.

325
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,620
I'm there for moral support.

326
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,060
Me too.

327
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,000
Zeller, Zeller, Zeller.

328
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,780
You don't want any of those red stratagems.

329
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
You don't want any of those red...

330
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,540
That's all he has.

331
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,400
That's the thing.

332
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,100
That's the problem.

333
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm clipping.

334
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,680
You don't want...

335
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,960
How do I unclip it?

336
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,500
No, no, no.

337
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,460
Keep it, keep it, keep it.

338
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,200
It should be fine.

339
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,500
No, you're so fucking dead.

340
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,740
What do you mean?

341
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,460
Oh!

342
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,560
I'm so fucking dead.

343
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,880
Oh, I know what he means.

344
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,580
No, it's okay.

345
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,760
He doesn't even remember how to activate his stratagem.

346
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,720
No, I do.

347
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,160
It was like the code shit.

348
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,380
It was like the beep, beep, boop, beep.

349
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,120
That shit, right?

350
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,040
Exactly.

351
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,540
Exactly.

353
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,280
Just when you throw it, just at least let us know.

354
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,560
Okay.

355
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,680
Okay.

356
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,380
Bro, if you didn't say that, now he's definitely not going to let us know.

357
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,080
What do you mean?

358
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm a commander, yo.

359
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,220
Okay.

360
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,120
You're a cadet.

361
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,280
You're a cadet.

362
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,460
We're both cadets.

363
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,040
The lucky bird is not ready.

364
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,660
Let's go.

365
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,180
Wait, I did.

366
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,980
Oh, I am ready.

367
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,820
Let's go.

368
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,320
Let's kill some bugs.

369
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,820
Bro, you know, when I was like fucking seven or six years old, we were fucking blockbusters, right?

370
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,560
Uh-huh.

371
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,160
And my dad was like, hey, let's get this like movie thing.

372
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,380
It's really cool, you know?

373
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,520
And I was like, oh yeah, what is it?

374
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,160
You know, Starship Troopers, right?

375
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,320
That shit traumatized me when I was a fucking kid.

376
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,340
Dude, like, there was like this fucking...

377
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,420
We're doing our part.

378
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,140
There was like this guy.

379
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,260
Yeah.

380
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,600
There was this guy who was like in the plane, like, we're gonna go kill him.

381
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,440
And then he gets his fucking legs chopped off.

382
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,160
And I was like, I was like, what the fuck is this?

383
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,960
I went, I went to my dad's room, right?

384
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,140
When I was like super, super young.

385
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
He was watching Starship Troopers.

386
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,360
I had no idea what it was.

387
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,240
I walked in.

388
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,220
Someone's brain was getting sucked out by a monster.

389
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,900
What the fuck?

390
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,640
Okay, that part was not scary.

391
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,340
The brain sucky.

392
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,780
It was so scary.

393
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,420
What do you mean?

394
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,020
No, the brain sucky fucky was not that scary.

395
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,000
The brain sucky what?

396
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,120
All right, calling in my machine gun.

397
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,640
What's this?

398
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,500
What do we do with this?

399
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,320
What do you mean?

400
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,200
What do we do with this?

401
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, shit.

402
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,720
What do you mean?

403
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,300
Oh, shit.

404
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,820
What's going on?

405
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,980
What is this shooting?

406
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,920
Zeller, Zeller, come here.

407
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,620
Zeller, come here.

408
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,140
Come on.

409
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,280
Come here.

410
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,620
Come here.

411
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:51,820
Come here.

412
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,420
Right here.

413
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,580
Right here.

414
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,220
Check it out.

415
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,480
Check it out.

416
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,620
Ready?

417
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:54,920
Ready?

418
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,680
What are you doing?

419
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:56,980
What are you?

420
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,560
Oh, wait.

421
00:11:59,420 --> 00:11:59,820
Who's who?

422
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm D2.

423
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,880
Yo, this motherfucker killed me.

424
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,620
He's teabagging me.

425
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,000
I request reinforcement.

426
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,700
Okay, X4 is Zeller.

427
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,480
At least we know.

428
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,420
Now, I request reinforcement.

429
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,420
All the trouble you've given me.

430
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,980
Oh, shit.

431
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
I'm back, bitches.

432
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,580
That's for the two hundred.

433
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,360
Oh, my God.

434
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,780
That's for the two hundred dollars.

435
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,400
Two hundred dollars?

436
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,920
What you mean?

437
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,860
I paid two hundred dollars.

438
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,820
Okay, where's the...

439
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,720
Guys, Zeller landed on me and I died.

440
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,140
Oh,

441
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,500
fucking Zeller.

442
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,860
Zeller, Zeller.

443
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,480
You are in danger.

444
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,380
You're in front of me!

445
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,340
That's not my fault!

446
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,940
You walked in front of my bullet!

447
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,820
RPI help us!

448
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,280
RPI...

449
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,500
RPI...

450
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:51,520
RPI...

451
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,300
RPI...

452
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,220
How did I land on you?

453
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,900
That's your fault for...

454
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,020
You landed on me!

455
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
I saved you!

456
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,960
Did you?

457
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,940
You killed me.

458
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,040
I also saved you, you can't deny that!

459
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,940
I'm not being good!

460
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,500
I got you!

461
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:11,960
I got you!

462
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,340
I got you!

463
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,660
Please don't get me anymore!

464
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,560
Please do not get me!

465
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,780
I got a reload apparently.

466
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,800
Oh yeah, don't like...

467
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,220
If you reload you lose your ammo in the reload.

468
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,600
So don't reload unless you have to.

469
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:28,920
Okay...

470
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,760
Where's my machine gun?

471
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,260
No!

472
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,180
I left the light.

473
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,160
You landed on Han and then you killed Rookie right now.

474
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,800
Oh, oh, oh.

475
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,280
What the fuck is that?

476
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,980
That's a METRONAUT!

477
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,940
What the fuck?!

478
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,560
This is not going very well.

479
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,240
No, I didn't!

480
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,060
Remember I wrote in chat, I was like, I think Xenon is going to kill us the most because he just finished the tutorial.

481
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,380
He hasn't!

482
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,100
Guys...

483
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,260
Alright, look, I'll just fucking go right up on the...

484
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,920
I'll just fucking... come on, if I'm not near you guys, I can't kill you.

485
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,620
I can't kill you guys, right?

486
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,420
Yeah, go off to the sunset.

487
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:11,620
I don't know that.

488
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,360
I got you, I got you.

489
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,420
I feel like you're gonna find a way.

490
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,960
You're gonna find a way.

491
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,480
These guys look like fucking crabs and shit.

492
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,140
Boy...

493
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,460
Bro, you gotta stop...

494
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,380
Bro, we gotta like...

495
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,300
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

496
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,800
We're so good.

497
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,320
We're so good.

498
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,820
Oh, big guy!

499
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,900
Bro, there's fall damage.

500
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,480
I forgot.

501
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,080
Shoot his butt, shoot his butt!

502
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,780
I'm shooting, I'm shooting the ass!

503
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,560
Beep, beep!

504
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,360
Shoot his leg.

505
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,400
I did something...

506
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,120
Ah, resupply here, guys!

507
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,220
Oh, I got you, I got you.

508
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,760
Oh my god, please do not throw this at us.

509
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,420
Please don't throw this at us.

510
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,580
Wait, is this guy dead?

511
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:45,880
Alright, we need ten more.

512
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,140
We need to kill ten more.

513
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,720
Wait, I think I remember this guy.

514
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,740
Isn't this guy the guy that comes out of the fucking dirt and like...

515
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,820
ate the girl in half or some shit?

516
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,860
Oh, this is like legally...

517
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,280
Oh, what?!

518
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,340
You shot me!

519
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,320
What do you mean?

520
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
I didn't shoot anybody!

521
00:14:59,520 --> 00:14:59,540
See?

522
00:14:59,540 --> 00:14:59,800
It's not me.

523
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,860
You shot me!

524
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

525
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,920
You have no proof.

526
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,020
You're not streaming.

527
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,940
You don't have proof.

528
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,660
Alright, guys, I got you.

529
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
Are you really going back on your shame?

530
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,580
Guys, I threw something.

531
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,640
Guys, I threw something.

532
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,320
I threw something.

533
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,020
Uh-oh.

534
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,380
Uh-oh.

535
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,880
It's fine.

536
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,200
It's fine.

537
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,560
We're fine.

538
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:13,940
We're fine.

539
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,200
We're fine.

540
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,600
What?!

541
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:14,960
You shot me!

542
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,500
I told you I threw it.

543
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:19,580
Get back!

544
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,160
I told you I threw something.

545
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,260
Okay, what do I do with this?

546
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,100
Hello, I'm coming back.

547
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,820
Oh, that's a free gun.

548
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,900
I don't know whose gun this is, but...

549
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,040
I'm here now.

550
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,860
Hey, guys, look at us.

551
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,820
We did the mission.

552
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,840
We did it.

553
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,940
We did it.

554
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,360
Nice!

555
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,540
We did it.

556
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,740
Let's go home, guys.

557
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:36,840
Let's go home, guys.

558
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:37,900
Wee!

559
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,660
Yay!

560
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,820
I was cooking, man.

561
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,420
Flawless.

562
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,120
Oh, I was fucking cooking.

563
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,220
Oh, I was fucking cooking.

564
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,220
Someone needs to flip that shit.

565
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,540
Someone needs to flip that shit.

566
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,940
He lands on Han right next to me, picks up his autocannon, and shoots the shit in her ass right now.

567
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,420
What?

568
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:55,920
Huh?

569
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,400
Guys, we did our first mission.

570
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,760
I'm so happy.

571
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:00,920
I don't know what happened.

572
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm so happy we picked the mission where we don't have to leave spawn.

573
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,540
Thank fucking God.

574
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,020
Thank God.

575
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,700
I'm not in this office with me, man.

576
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,300
Holy shit.

577
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,800
Okay, let's see who had the least deaths.

578
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,080
It doesn't show that.

579
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,520
It doesn't show that.

580
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,980
No?

581
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,480
Yay!

582
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,940
Look at us!

583
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,340
We got five stars, guys!

584
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:28,940
Let's go!

585
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,460
We did so well.

586
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:30,940
We were cooking.

587
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,640
Holy shit.

588
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,700
I feel like Zeller did not deserve to level up.

589
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,860
I had the most experience point.

590
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
You know what that means.

591
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,480
We all get the same amount of experience.

592
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,180
We got the same experience.

593
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,680
It's just because you're level one.

594
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,160
Well, it's a thought that counts.

595
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,900
It looks like I got more.

596
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,600
Look at that default.

597
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,520
No, no, no, no.

598
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,120
I'm not default.

599
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,200
I'm clapping.

600
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,660
That's different.

601
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,880
Let's see.

602
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,440
Friendly fire damage 25.

603
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,260
Look at the stats right now.

604
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,480
The stats.

605
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,460
Okay, let's see the stats.

606
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,660
Doki died four times.

607
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,040
I wonder why.

608
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,900
Dude, I have more kills than Doki.

609
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,020
Oh, yeah.

610
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,180
I was dead like 80% of the fucking round.

611
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,880
No, that's just... that's a youth problem.

612
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,020
Sorry, guys.

613
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,060
Sorry, I tripped and fell.

614
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,640
Everything was in the air.

615
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,540
I didn't even use a stim, bro.

616
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,600
I didn't even use a heal, you know.

617
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,340
Sorry, guys.

618
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,540
I tripped and fell.

619
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,600
Accidents happen.

620
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,380
Friendly fire damage 25.

621
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,720
We are 40 minutes late to this first game.

622
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,900
Literally being a movie.

623
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,580
Someone needs to just make a clip of that entire first game from his POV.

624
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,400
Bro, 2583 friendly damage.

625
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,460
What the fuck?

626
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,200
You did more damage on your team than the fucking bugs.

627
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,540
Hell yeah.

628
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
I'm going... I'm fucking going in.

629
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,380
Bro, I was like pressing some random buttons.

630
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,140
Like, what's this?

631
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,580
And then I threw something.

632
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,560
I was like, what the fuck is that?

633
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,720
And then it like started going off.

634
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,120
I was like, that's a fucking grenade.

635
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,960
Guys, I threw something.

636
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,540
I threw something.

637
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,380
Everyone fucking dies.

638
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,680
Bro, I don't think... I don't think Zeller will... I don't think we should take Zeller to the robot island.

639
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,060
I don't think we should...

640
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,920
Dude, leave it to me, man.

641
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,740
Probably not a good idea.

642
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,800
There's no way.

643
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,320
There's no way we're going to survive robot land.

644
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,460
I'll cook.

645
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,740
Now you guys... Now chat can tell that like I was not the problem that we're like here.

646
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,980
Like, look what he's doing in game.

647
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,420
Like, you guys think he can handle steam?

648
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,100
Fuck you mean, man?

649
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,560
I had it already and then...

650
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,960
Dude, I count problems, okay?

651
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,080
I think RPR is a little low in volume.

652
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,340
RPR boost your volume.

653
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,400
Yeah, RPR boost...

654
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,040
Just talk louder in your office.

655
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,180
You can maneuver the pawn.

656
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,480
Talk louder, I'm gonna get kicked.

657
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,980
Talk louder.

658
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
All right, guys.

659
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,440
This time we're a team, right?

660
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,620
Yep, totally.

661
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,360
Ah, ah, me too.

662
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,220
Yeah, we killed.

663
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:13,920
Yeah, totally.

664
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,720
Watch your back, Zeller.

665
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,020
Watch your back.

666
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,700
I'll kill you guys.

667
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,580
Don't you worry.

668
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,260
Am I louder?

669
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:24,800
Hello?

670
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,180
Oh, I'm in the autocannon.

671
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,680
Okay, can you guys hear me?

672
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,160
Yeah, we can hear you.

673
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,080
What the fuck is that?

674
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,780
Wait, what are you guys all throwing?

675
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,480
Oh, we're throwing machine guns.

676
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:35,760
Oh, it's the supply.

677
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,240
Yeah.

678
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,900
What happened?

679
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,400
Hey, guys, I'm dead.

680
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,600
What happened?

681
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,840
They have supplies.

682
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,460
Hey, guys, I'm dead.

683
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,960
What the fuck just happened?

684
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,060
Boo-hoo!

685
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,500
Boo-hoo!

686
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,660
Boo-hoo!

687
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,360
Boo-hoo!

688
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,500
Boo -hoo!

689
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,320
Yeah, surprise.

690
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,960
All back, bitches!

691
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,720
Why not?

692
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,440
Look, that was not my fault you were a casualty.

693
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,400
What do you mean it wasn't your fault?

694
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,280
You should have known what that was!

695
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,580
I got a free machine gun!

696
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,160
I got a free machine gun!

697
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,000
I was minding my own business!

698
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,020
Somehow I only got team kill points.

699
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,360
Where's my machine gun?

700
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,420
I lost it!

701
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,280
I died!

702
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,040
You didn't take my machine gun!

703
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,440
Oh, I did.

704
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:30,920
Thank you.

705
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,760
Did someone take my auto backpack?

706
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,240
Oh, I did.

707
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,320
I have everything.

708
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,080
You're gonna have to reload me later.

709
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,240
What?

710
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,440
How do I reload you?

711
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,700
Okay, here, take this.

712
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,220
Take the machine gun!

713
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,460
I got you, machine gun!

714
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,920
Where's my machine gun?

715
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,220
It's coming!

716
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm gonna do the objective.

717
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,360
Oh, yes, nice!

718
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,280
My machine gun!

719
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,300
I gotta reload, guys.

720
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,320
I'm reloading.

721
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,580
I couldn't get my machine gun!

722
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,960
I couldn't get it!

723
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,720
I need to come back.

724
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,620
I got you, I got you, I got you.

725
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,000
Are you dead again?

726
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,480
Wow.

727
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,840
You're pretty shit at this game, Ghosty.

728
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,420
Oh, yeah!

729
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,760
Where the fuck's my machine gun, Zeller?

730
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,860
Because he died twice, I guess I have to take it in my own hands.

731
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,720
RPR, I got your six.

732
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,960
Oh, I found it.

733
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,320
There you go, I got it.

734
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,680
Don't worry, we're helping now.

735
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,120
It's so fucking sandy, man.

736
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,260
RPR, raise your volume, you're still low.

737
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,520
I got you guys, I got the machine gun!

738
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,760
Wonderful.

739
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,500
And he's dead.

740
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,060
Yeah, I think he's dead, guys.

741
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,960
I think I get my ammo back at least.

742
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,380
Yay!

743
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,680
I think he's dead, guys.

744
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,640
I can't see shit, there's a sandstorm!

745
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,700
It's a little rough.

746
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,060
This is a little rough.

747
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,580
Who chose this game?

748
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,120
Coming!

749
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,760
Welcome back!

750
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,100
I can't see anything.

751
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,040
Where do we go?

752
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,180
Uh, let's go...

753
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,060
Guys, I have the ultimate weapon.

754
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,780
What is it?

755
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,600
I swear to God, if you're gonna throw this...

756
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,440
It's the orbital weapon, I got it.

757
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,360
RPR's standing still, Zeller.

758
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,640
I'm fixing my audio, is it better now?

759
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,320
Oh yeah, that's a lot better, actually.

760
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,720
I got the ultimate, I got my ultimate with me, guys.

761
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,540
What the fuck is your ultimate?

762
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,380
Throw it.

763
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,220
Throw it.

764
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,380
Huh?

765
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:24,840
Okay.

766
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,000
You want me to throw the ultimate?

767
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,700
Yeah, throw it.

768
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,200
Don't be a little bitch, throw it.

769
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,880
No no no, don't do that, don't do that, don't do that.

770
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,020
We don't need that.

771
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,120
Huh?

772
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,940
Throw it.

773
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,200
There they are, I threw it, I threw it, I threw it!

774
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,340
It's coming!

775
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,500
Yes, the orbital strike!

776
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,980
Two, one!

777
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,000
What?

778
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,100
Boom!

779
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,880
There we go, look at him, he's learning!

780
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,620
Wow.

781
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,660
He's actually learning!

782
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,880
They already all died, though.

783
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,280
You guys killed a lot of dead bodies.

784
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,580
Dude, you guys made...

785
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,380
You guys did not make my ultimate worth, you guys wasted it.

786
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,980
What do you mean you did that?

787
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,220
You guys didn't need to kill all of them.

788
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,880
No no no, that was all you, that was your bomb.

789
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,280
It was all you.

790
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,120
I'm gonna bomb you guys.

791
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,080
What did we do?

792
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,200
We literally picked you up!

793
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,920
You killed them all!

794
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,740
You killed them all, what do we do?

795
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,580
Oh no, I'm reloading.

796
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,980
Dude, I have to stop reloading, man.

797
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,740
I'm giving you moral support.

798
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,180
I'm giving you moral support.

799
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,920
Oh, you gotta stop reloading this gun.

800
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,380
Wait, RPR, what do we do, RPR?

801
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,420
I don't know this objective, you're the super citizen.

802
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,500
I'm signal strengthening.

803
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,160
Are you doing the puzzle?

804
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
I can't see it, because you guys are sitting here.

805
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,360
Thanks guys, thank you, that really helped.

806
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,880
You're the super citizen, RPR, you should be able to know what to do.

807
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,220
Yeah, yeah, that really helped, guys, thanks, thanks.

808
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,940
No problem.

809
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm glad we're helpful, guys.

810
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,720
Alright, um...

811
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,360
Wait, do you guys wanna like do everything, or do the main objective only?

812
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,800
Wait, we should teach Zeller how to play this, so we should do everything.

813
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,380
Uh oh.

814
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,160
Uh oh.

815
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,820
Okay, come with me then.

816
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,300
Whoa!

817
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,220
You fucking...

818
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,120
What happened?

819
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,660
How is, how are you guys dead all the time?

820
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,960
We let Zeller cook.

821
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,660
Zeller cooked a little bit too long, let's just say.

822
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,520
I'm back!

823
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,040
Wait, how did you do that?

824
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,800
How did you do that?

825
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,000
F, F, F, F, F, F.

826
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,720
No, where's my machine gun?

827
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,020
He's coming back.

828
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,020
No, what the fuck!

829
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,860
Why was it always me?

830
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,580
Why is it always me?

831
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,380
We literally kicked his ass.

832
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,440
What the fuck.

833
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,080
We could have failed this mission or...

834
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,280
actually failed this mission.

835
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,320
Well then okay.

836
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,420
I'm gonna steal somebody's gun.

837
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,160
Oh, this is my railgun now.

838
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,660
AAH!

839
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,980
Eh, mine.

840
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,160
These small crabs!

841
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,600
Where's my... that railgun?

842
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,220
What the fuck?

843
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,780
Holy shit!

844
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,520
Something help me!

845
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,520
No, please!

846
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,120
We're fine, we're fine.

847
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,420
No, no, no, no, no!

848
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,020
He's dead, bro.

849
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
It's okay, we can call him back!

850
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,720
It's okay, it's ugly!

851
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,420
I don't have a railgun.

852
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,700
I got you, I got you, I got you.

853
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,380
Zeller is so lucky that this is unlimited reinforcements.

854
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,520
No, it's not, we have nine reinforcements.

855
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,500
No, no, it's unlimited!

856
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,980
What are you guys talking about?

857
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,300
It's unlimited.

858
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,140
I got the grenade, I got the grenade!

859
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:36,820
Leave it to me!

860
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,320
No, no, no, no, no!

861
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,380
BOOM!

862
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,020
Who keeps giving him grenades?

863
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Nice, nice, I killed him, I killed him, I killed him, I killed him.

864
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,060
No, you didn't, there's still bugs in front of us.

865
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,560
What do you mean?

866
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,320
Well, not all of them, I didn't say all of them.

867
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,400
Okay, I killed one.

868
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm so proud of you.

869
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,440
I made the game look like Roblox.

870
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,480
The one out of a hundred bugs in this island, in this planet.

871
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,940
Oh my gosh.

872
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,800
Oh no!

873
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,500
Guys, we have dead teammates.

874
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,900
I stood in front of RPR's ray gun.

875
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,780
We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.

876
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:18,740
Nice.

877
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,880
That's where you died?

878
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,940
Yeah, I stood in front of the ray gun.

879
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,220
Oh, acid!

880
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,940
He spat acid on me, man.

881
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,880
Oh no, where's the rail gun that's still from RPR?

882
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,300
Wait, don't you smell the rail gun?

883
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,100
Bring it back.

884
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,160
What did I do?

885
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,240
I'm back.

886
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,920
You're stealing my rail gun.

887
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,140
Wait, wait, yeah, I want good weapons too.

888
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,720
Where's the good weapon?

889
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,780
Give us the good weapon.

890
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,140
Wait, it doesn't even have ammo.

891
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,840
What are you doing?

892
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,600
Sample container.

893
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,920
I got the sample container.

894
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:52,440
No!

895
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,100
Nice.

896
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,300
You wanted me, I'm gonna kill you.

897
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,960
Fuck you!

898
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,220
What's that?

899
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:02,580
Oh!

900
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,320
What's this?

901
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,920
Oh, I got something cool, yo.

902
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
You should've not murdered me, man.

903
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,040
Bro!

904
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,640
Bring us back!

905
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,920
Bring us back!

906
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,360
Cool!

907
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,120
It's cool.

908
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,080
It's okay, we have unlimited.

909
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,380
Oh, I got the rail gun, guys.

910
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,320
I got the rail gun.

911
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,140
It's okay, guys.

912
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,980
We have unlimited.

913
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,140
If you drop my fucking gun.

914
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:22,640
There's no...

915
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,180
There's no...

916
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,580
Oh!

917
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,120
I'm gonna die.

918
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,700
I'm gonna die.

919
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:26,960
I'm gonna die.

920
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,040
Maybe we should just do the regular objectives, because I don't think we can do the extra ones.

921
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,780
No, we can do it.

922
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,020
I couldn't even...

923
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,200
We're gamers.

924
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,280
We're gamers.

925
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,880
You literally played 10 hours of Helldivers 2 yesterday.

926
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,300
Are you trying to say you can't do it?

927
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,940
Are you trying to say you're not a gamer, hun?

928
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,640
Is that it?

929
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,000
I knew you said I won.

930
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,100
I knew you said I won.

931
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,840
Wait, I think I'm OP at this game.

932
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,400
Oh, shit.

933
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,320
Something's hitting me.

934
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,380
Uh-oh.

935
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,720
Wait, where do we go?

936
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,740
RPR, where do we go?

937
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,140
You're supposed to tell us where to go.

938
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,780
We're going to the main mission, because there's just no way we're gonna do anything else.

939
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,480
Ooh, a rail gun.

940
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,580
Ooh.

941
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,120
Yeah, you're not getting the rail gun.

942
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,800
What do you mean?

943
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,160
Okay.

944
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,560
Eventually...

945
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,400
Especially not one, though.

946
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,780
I got one, though.

947
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,500
Eventually, we're gonna get it.

948
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,220
I'm scared of...

949
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,680
What if...

950
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,460
Okay, no.

951
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,300
How do you use the railgun?

952
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,640
You just... you shoot it like any other gun, Zeller.

953
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,840
What do you mean?

954
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,900
You have to reload it after you shoot a bullet.

955
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,080
He's doing great.

956
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,540
So you shoot a bullet, press R.

957
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,360
Shoot a bullet, press R.

958
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,140
Oh!

959
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,060
Let's do this.

960
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,200
Who wants to be my teammate?

961
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,740
My stamina is so low.

962
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,960
I can't run anymore.

963
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,240
What is this?

964
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:45,740
Wow.

965
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,160
What?

966
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,400
Oh!

967
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,840
Ouch!

968
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,360
Ouch!

969
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,660
Ouch!

970
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,620
Bro, you guys are like bullying babies.

971
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,660
That's fucked up.

972
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,840
Watch out!

973
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,220
Watch out!

974
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,500
Watch out!

975
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,020
Nice.

976
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,880
Good luck, guys.

977
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,120
I'll be reloading my ammo.

978
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,800
Oh, hey.

979
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,700
There's more grenades here.

980
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,560
So with railgun, you shoot this guy's legs, not his ass.

981
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,660
Zeller, you can reload the grenades here.

982
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,400
Oh, grenade?

983
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,400
No, I have four grenades.

984
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,360
There's grenades in the fucking area.

985
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:13,940
I have four.

986
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,840
I have a lot of grenades.

987
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,700
Wonderful.

988
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,700
That's what he needs.

989
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,400
More grenades.

990
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,120
There you go.

991
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:20,860
Nice!

992
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,800
So you shoot his leg twice with railgun and then you can...

993
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,160
It breaks the armor and then you just shoot the leg until he dies.

994
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,040
How come Zeller gets to have a railgun and I can't?

995
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,340
You can have a railgun.

996
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,520
Here.

997
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,600
Can I...

998
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,580
There you go.

999
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:32,960
Yay!

1000
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,440
Yay!

1001
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,840
I got fed!

1002
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,380
Also, I'll just... I mean, I'll have you both know you both stole that railgun from me and the roler duck and you will die eventually when I have enough.

1003
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,200
A rubber duck?

1004
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,680
I want a rubber duck.

1005
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,820
You want a... You want some ammo, Hattie?

1006
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,420
Like, we can make some ammo real quick here.

1007
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,580
Wait, we're getting glam?

1008
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm so down.

1009
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,040
I'm so happy I have a railgun now.

1010
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,800
Yay!

1011
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,040
Yay!

1012
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,180
Yippee!

1013
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,880
Is that a railgun even?

1014
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,660
What's this?

1015
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,380
Explosive barrel.

1016
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,200
Oh my god.

1017
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,420
Oh no, do not shoot it.

1018
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,980
No, I got it.

1019
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,400
I got it.

1020
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,780
Can I shoot it?

1021
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,140
I got it, yo.

1022
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,480
No!

1023
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,080
No!

1024
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,980
Hey, uh, we don't need to reinforce him, do we?

1025
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,140
Wait, I can steal his railgun.

1026
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
Where's his railgun?

1027
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:31,600
True!

1028
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,900
Where's his railgun?

1029
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,180
You already took his railgun.

1030
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,380
How many times do you want to take it?

1031
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,820
As many times as you want.

1032
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,340
As many times as I can.

1033
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,680
This is called bullying.

1034
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,220
We have two reinforcements.

1035
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,780
It's not bullying if I'm also a baby.

1036
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,400
We have two reinforcements and then...

1037
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,620
Oh, you tried, didn't you?

1038
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,560
What?

1039
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,940
What?

1040
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,040
What?

1041
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,920
Try what?

1042
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,720
What do you mean try?

1043
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,040
Try your best.

1044
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,700
That's what you're doing.

1045
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,660
Hell yeah, you know it.

1046
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,940
You know what she did.

1047
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,520
What are you guys talking about?

1048
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,720
You didn't do anything.

1049
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,620
You survived.

1050
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,500
Here, Zeller, take this, okay?

1051
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,140
Wait, I'm cooking.

1052
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,600
I'm cooking.

1053
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,120
You can have this autocannon.

1054
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,260
Look, Zeller, look, look, look.

1055
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,300
I'm going to throw a nuclear bomb.

1056
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,760
Look, look, look.

1057
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,440
Huh?

1058
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,920
What are you going to do?

1059
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,320
Uh-oh.

1060
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,540
Uh-oh.

1061
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,260
Uh-oh.

1062
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,300
What's that eagle?

1063
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,640
Uh-oh.

1064
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,140
Oh, wow.

1065
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:29,960
Whoa!

1066
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,160
It's all right.

1067
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,500
We can have a little radiation.

1068
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,580
So what's so special about that?

1069
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,460
That's pretty cool, right?

1070
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,460
It's a nuclear bomb.

1071
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,180
Oh.

1072
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,520
Any more?

1073
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,040
It's 500 kg.

1074
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,980
Let's order more.

1075
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,000
I can.

1076
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,740
It's cool down.

1077
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,820
Thank you.

1078
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,520
Wait, you can technically have, like, unlimited nuclear bombs.

1079
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,780
What's this?

1080
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,440
Interact.

1081
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,680
What are you doing, huh?

1082
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,880
Oh, we have to escort this, guys.

1083
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,240
Why are you so slow?

1084
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,260
Oh!

1085
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,700
Why are you so...

1086
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,060
No!

1087
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,360
No!

1088
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:56,760
No!

1089
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,840
No!

1090
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:57,980
No!

1091
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,300
No!

1092
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:58,460
No!

1093
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:58,800
No!

1094
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,100
No!

1095
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,660
No!

1096
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,700
He's not real.

1097
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,260
No!

1098
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,900
No, no, no.

1099
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,560
We are escorting him.

1100
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:10,940
We're professionals.

1101
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,620
It's fine.

1102
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,200
We're fine.

1103
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,160
I broke him.

1104
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,400
Nice!

1105
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,080
I forgot there's fall damage again.

1106
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,940
Nice.

1107
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,900
He's not a real human being.

1108
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,420
Let me cook.

1109
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:20,940
Let me cook.

1110
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,380
Yeah, I'm cooking.

1111
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,400
Okay.

1112
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:22,620
Sorry.

1113
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,080
I stint.

1114
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,160
Go click those buttons, guys.

1115
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,980
We need more civilians.

1116
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,040
Civilians!

1117
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,760
What do we press?

1118
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,400
What do we do, Artier?

1119
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,800
I love killing civilians.

1120
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,720
It's okay.

1121
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,500
It's okay.

1122
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,440
Don't kill civilians.

1123
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,680
They're not real people anyway.

1124
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:38,860
Yeah.

1125
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,600
What about a leg shot?

1126
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,820
What about a leg shot?

1127
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,100
Hey, how about a head shot for you?

1128
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,480
What if they rail gun you?

1129
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,500
No!

1130
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,120
I have done nothing!

1131
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,080
Why don't we just slap him?

1132
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,040
We should slap him.

1133
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,940
Yeah, let's bully him.

1134
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,500
I am innocent.

1135
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,180
He can just heal up.

1136
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,620
We have unlimited reinforcements, remember?

1137
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,260
Are you running?

1138
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,720
Are you trying to run away from us?

1139
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,160
I just see him try to serpentine.

1140
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,420
I'm like, what?

1141
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,260
He's like running in an S formation.

1142
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,560
Bro, you have no stamina, bro!

1143
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:18,840
Bugs!

1144
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:18,980
Bugs!

1145
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,320
Bugs!

1146
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,080
Bro, you have no stamina!

1147
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,240
Wow!

1148
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,220
It's okay.

1149
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,620
We're fine.

1150
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,080
Bugs are good.

1151
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,680
See?

1152
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,260
Good job.

1153
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
We're doing it.

1154
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:31,820
All right.

1155
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,900
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1156
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,540
So easy.

1157
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:34,780
So easy.

1158
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,240
How many civilians are there?

1159
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,360
Why are they all trapped?

1160
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,900
I wasn't late.

1161
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,820
Bro, now chat's lying to... bro, fuck all of you.

1162
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,740
What did I do?

1163
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,840
What did I do?

1164
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,820
It's fine.

1165
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,100
We didn't be late.

1166
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,520
I wasn't late.

1167
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,760
Bro, why were you late, RPR?

1168
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,560
None of us were late, okay?

1169
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,640
It was just technical issues.

1170
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:54,940
Oh, yeah.

1171
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,760
So now that...

1172
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,960
Your brain was freaking late.

1173
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,840
That works great for you, Zeller.

1174
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,960
Yeah, none of us were late.

1175
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,820
You're a bold man.

1176
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,360
I'm a bold man.

1177
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,480
I'm a bold man.

1178
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,660
L plus ratio.

1179
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:07,960
Damn.

1180
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,120
Where did you get that wig, RPR?

1181
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,340
It's pretty nice.

1182
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,240
Yeah, it's a pretty nice wig.

1183
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,440
I'm not the bold one.

1184
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,440
Manda's the bold one.

1185
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,640
Let's go.

1186
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,580
Where do we go now?

1187
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,320
Where do we go?

1188
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,800
RPR, super citizen.

1189
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,140
Come to me.

1190
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,380
Okay.

1191
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,040
All right.

1192
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,200
Where are you?

1193
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,260
Dang, these turrets are broken.

1194
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,260
Yeah, don't stand in front of it.

1195
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,160
Oh, no.

1196
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,860
No, no, no, no.

1197
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,680
What the fuck?

1198
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,460
What the fuck?

1199
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,360
What?

1200
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:35,940
What did you do?

1201
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,280
Why did you do that?

1202
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,900
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1203
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,240
What did you do that?

1204
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,200
I did nothing.

1205
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,420
Why did you do that?

1206
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,840
Wait, I broke my neck because you passed me in the air.

1207
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,340
Bro, did you see how far I flew?

1208
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,180
Holy shit, man.

1209
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:57,920
I flew.

1210
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,240
Bro, where are you?

1211
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,440
By the way, the next person who dies can't come back for two minutes.

1212
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,300
So use that information as you will.

1213
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,700
Use that information as you will.

1214
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,480
Let's go extract.

1215
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,760
There's a giant bug following us from behind.

1216
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,280
Not anymore.

1217
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,140
He's still there.

1218
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,640
What do you mean?

1219
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,500
He's dead.

1220
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,240
Nice.

1221
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,260
Let's extract because we have no lives.

1222
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,220
Wait.

1223
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,760
Wait for us.

1224
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,600
Me too.

1225
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,340
Hey, baby girl.

1226
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,960
Show Doki.

1227
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,520
I saw it.

1228
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,920
You dropped me like your friend.

1229
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,440
Hey, what's up, baby girl?

1230
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,380
I found one of these.

1231
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,440
Oh, God.

1232
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,780
I'll run into the monsters with this.

1233
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,260
I'll run into the monsters with this.

1234
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,660
I will be the sacrifice.

1235
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
We believe in you.

1236
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:08,720
Just let me.

1237
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,160
We have no lives.

1238
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,460
No, we do.

1239
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,440
We have one more.

1240
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,420
He can use this for the last life.

1241
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,840
But I can't run.

1242
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,660
There's a bug behind.

1243
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,540
We'll do this.

1244
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,640
Me, guys.

1245
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:21,740
Me.

1246
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,580
What are you doing?

1247
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,380
What are you doing?

1248
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:33,920
No sacrifice.

1249
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,580
This is not fair.

1250
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,820
Zeller, thank you for sacrificing yourself for the con.

1251
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,600
Yeah, for like one cockroach.

1252
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,500
Hey, a bug's a bug.

1253
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,340
Zeller, a bug's a bug.

1254
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,600
I can't believe it.

1255
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,660
This is a scam.

1256
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,220
Two seconds.

1257
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,980
This is what you wanted, though.

1258
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,320
Thank you for your sacrifice.

1259
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,780
Thank you for it.

1260
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,100
You did your part, Zeller.

1261
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,040
You did your part.

1262
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,920
You're a great asset to the company.

1263
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,180
This is a scam.

1264
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,800
I think the worst part was that bug didn't even die.

1265
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,460
But guess what?

1266
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,640
I am back.

1267
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,160
Hey, welcome back.

1268
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,120
Join the fray.

1269
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,320
Let's go.

1270
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:23,880
Onwards.

1271
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,720
Oh, they are.

1272
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,320
Wait, where is the extraction?

1273
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1274
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,980
Don't worry.

1275
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,440
Hell yeah, leave it to Mr. Zeller, bitch.

1276
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,440
Uh-huh.

1277
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,980
There's an orbital strike.

1278
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,080
Oh, there's rockets here.

1279
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,460
Oh, wait, there's rockets here.

1280
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,400
Alright, there's an orbital walking barrage in one second.

1281
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,720
Onwards.

1282
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,600
You guys can pick up rockets.

1283
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,640
You stuck him with that and he saw me.

1284
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,180
No.

1285
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,580
Bro, you're lying.

1286
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,620
Why are you panicking?

1287
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,940
Why are you so scared?

1288
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:00,700
You're lying.

1289
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,120
Look at me, cook.

1290
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,920
Don't hit him.

1291
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,140
Go.

1292
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,840
I dropped the orbital thingy.

1293
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,880
I'm so proud of you.

1294
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,880
Oh my god, he's learning.

1295
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,800
Wait, there's a floating rock.

1296
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,740
There's rocket launchers here, guys.

1297
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,460
Why are you holding them?

1298
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Oh, I got one.

1299
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,100
It's okay, guys.

1300
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,520
I'll know how to use it.

1301
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,700
Rocket launcher?

1302
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,140
Nice!

1303
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,840
We did it!

1304
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,640
We got them!

1305
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,600
We got the nest!

1306
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,800
Wait, why is there a floating rocket launcher here?

1307
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,060
You can take it.

1308
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,100
Hell yeah!

1309
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,880
There's only like one shot though, isn't it?

1310
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,760
Yeah, one shot's enough.

1311
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,300
Who are you gonna shoot?

1312
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,600
Who are you gonna shoot, Stellar?

1313
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,600
A tank.

1314
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,700
It says anti-tank.

1315
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,120
Guys, I don't want to bunch up together right now.

1316
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,680
Guys, I don't want to bunch up together right now.

1317
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm gonna jump next to you guys.

1318
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Where's the big guy?

1319
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,520
Come on, show me the big one.

1320
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,840
It's dead.

1321
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,580
He's dead.

1322
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,500
We did it.

1323
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,380
I'm resupplying.

1324
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,340
You're gonna respawn?

1325
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,020
Resupply.

1326
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,040
Oh yeah, I was gonna say, we can...

1327
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,980
You know, we have one more if you want to respawn.

1328
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,080
No, that's for Zeller.

1329
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,200
I don't like how Zeller's walking around with it.

1330
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,000
Me too.

1331
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,560
I'm not bunching up with you guys.

1332
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,040
I haven't killed anyone today yet.

1333
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,700
What are these shiny...

1334
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,580
He hasn't done it yet.

1335
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,540
We killed him seven times in the first mission.

1336
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,700
Dude, there's like...

1337
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,040
shiny fruits over here.

1338
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,680
Pick it up.

1339
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,520
No, I'm just running.

1340
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,740
I gotta get to the shuttle.

1341
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,680
Don't worry, you have two minutes.

1342
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,300
Zeller, we have two minutes.

1343
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:49,640
Okay, okay.

1344
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,600
Don't worry, we can do it.

1345
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,000
You're gonna get to use your rocket launcher now.

1346
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,960
Hell yeah.

1347
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,760
Yeah, this is it.

1348
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,440
This is the time.

1349
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,380
I really want to shoot you right now, but I'm not going to.

1350
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,080
How do I put this down?

1351
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,960
Okay, like that.

1352
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:08,840
Yeah.

1353
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,680
Oh, there's a railgun!

1354
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,580
Rocket launcher time!

1355
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,740
Look, I'm feeding the kids by throwing their shoulder shots.

1356
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,360
Oh my god, look at the railgun!

1357
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,700
Wait, the sentry gun's killing everything.

1358
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,660
I don't even have an opportunity to use it.

1359
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,360
I'm gonna nuclear bomb that side.

1360
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,500
Wait, which side?

1361
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,400
Oh, I'm hiding, I'm hiding.

1362
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,780
Alright, I'm gonna...

1363
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,980
I am going to send in a cluster bomb right here.

1364
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,780
They're here!

1365
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,640
My...

1366
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,160
My...

1367
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,020
You didn't even kill him.

1368
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:42,960
No...

1369
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,000
He killed me!

1370
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,440
I did too!

1371
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,680
Oh no!

1372
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,020
Oh...

1373
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:55,780
My...

1374
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,640
Wait, did we...

1375
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,440
Gosh... I'm in.

1376
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,320
I'm in.

1377
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,680
I'm in.

1378
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,300
It's up to you!

1379
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,780
Shoot bomb from extraction!

1380
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,360
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running!

1381
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,040
Oh, he's just...

1382
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,560
I will save everybody!

1383
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,380
We have 1 minute and 38 seconds!

1384
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,220
You better!

1385
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,780
RPR, why did you throw, RPR?

1386
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,040
I didn't.

1387
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,640
I pulled in a mortar, but you guys stood next to me.

1388
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:24,960
You guys stood next to me.

1389
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,940
Animals, so you exploded.

1390
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,880
We all died, bro!

1391
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,500
I was holding onto the gasoline tank and walking to the big dude.

1392
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,820
I was holding onto the gasoline tank and walking to the big dude.

1393
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,260
Okay, listen, it's not my fault.

1394
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,560
I can't believe RPR threw that.

1395
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,680
I can't believe.

1396
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,320
Clutch or kick.

1397
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,280
Yeah, clutch or kick, Han.

1398
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,800
Oh, bro, this seems like a nightmare.

1399
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,200
Bro, I can't even fucking spectate him.

1400
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:50,340
Holy sh...

1401
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,380
I'm like looking at my own dead body.

1402
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,640
Oh, okay, look at that movement!

1403
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,160
Shit!

1404
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,020
Are you kidding me?

1405
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,760
Oh, no!

1406
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,440
There's two of them.

1407
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,540
He's fine, he's fine.

1408
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,240
Shuttle's landing!

1409
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,520
Live for 45 seconds so you can slowly bring each of us back.

1410
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,800
Live for 45 seconds so you can slowly bring each of us back.

1411
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,640
You're so greedy.

1412
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,160
You're so greedy.

1413
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,280
It's gonna deduct points.

1414
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,940
You don't want the points to be deducted.

1415
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,360
Han, you don't want the points to be deducted.

1416
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,740
You just have to live for like six more minutes.

1417
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,440
Yeah, just live for six more minutes.

1418
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,420
It's so easy.

1419
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,200
It'll be so easy.

1420
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,680
We're smelting.

1421
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,540
Why is he still living?

1422
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,940
Just four minutes.

1423
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,020
How are you spectating it?

1424
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,660
I'm just looking at my own dead body.

1425
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,720
Me too.

1426
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,760
What?

1427
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,340
I don't know.

1428
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,660
I'm spectating it somehow.

1429
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:40,580
I don't know.

1430
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:40,860
That's okay.

1431
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,100
No!

1432
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,500
Wait!

1433
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,640
Are you dead?

1434
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,480
Did you just leave?

1435
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,580
No, he died.

1436
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,200
No, he died.

1437
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,240
Wait, you died?

1438
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,100
I have no idea how I died there.

1439
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,660
I was so far behind my thing.

1440
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,160
Han Solo.

1441
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,040
Bro, I guess we gotta kick him.

1442
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,980
He didn't clutch.

1443
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,200
To be honest, like, Zeller kinda spent like 18 of our...

1444
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,300
Yeah, I didn't do nothing.

1445
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,140
Worth while sacrifice.

1446
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,620
Let's see the stats.

1447
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,380
Let the stats talk for themselves.

1448
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,740
I don't think he want us to look at the stats.

1449
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,320
You guys do realize he loves Discord, right?

1450
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,720
I leveled up.

1451
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,880
You guys hear me?

1452
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,700
Yeah, we can.

1453
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,460
Oh wait, wait!

1454
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,100
What happened to Han?

1455
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,560
He'll come back.

1456
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,220
You guys should watch your kick.

1457
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,280
He kicked himself.

1458
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,300
He's just taking a shit.

1459
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,600
He actually kicked himself.

1460
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,060
He couldn't clutch.

1461
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,780
It's an excuse for him to go take shit.

1462
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,900
Let's look at stats.

1463
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,780
Let's see Zeller's stats.

1464
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,040
Han did 4.1 kills initially.

1465
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,940
Wait, Han did 4.000?

1466
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,260
Bro, Han did 4.000?

1467
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,020
Zeller did 10 times.

1468
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,140
Look at my accuracy.

1469
00:43:59,440 --> 00:43:59,740
Bro!

1470
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,540
Yes, because I was...

1471
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,380
I had like the...

1472
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,780
I had the unfortunate circumstances of being next to Zeller.

1473
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,920
So that I got killed as well because I was right next to him.

1474
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,500
Well, that's your fault.

1475
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,980
Wrong place, wrong time.

1476
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,380
Dumbass bitch.

1477
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,940
That's your fault.

1478
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,020
Not mine.

1479
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,580
Mine.

1480
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,180
How is that my fault?

1481
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,140
You're right.

1482
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,300
I should never stand next to you.

1483
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,340
I'm never standing next to you again.

1484
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,400
Now I can kill her and she won't know it's me because I'm far away.

1485
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,680
What the fuck do you mean?

1486
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,320
You're gonna kill like Han and RPR if I stand next to them.

1487
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,400
Well, I guess that's that then.

1488
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,060
Holy shit!

1489
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,820
How the fuck did Han do 4.000 friendly fire?

1490
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,820
How?

1491
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,080
I think he killed Zeller like 15 times.

1492
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,480
I only died 10 times, man!

1493
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,140
It says here I only died 10 times.

1494
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,080
Han actually kicked himself out of the group too.

1495
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,200
Han, welcome back.

1496
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,380
Han, you did 4.000 friendly fire damage, Han.

1497
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,400
What the fuck?

1498
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,780
He was so crazy.

1499
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,920
It was fine.

1500
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,180
Oh my god.

1501
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,100
Wait, we unlocked hard difficulty, guys.

1502
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,660
I'm on hard now.

1503
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:13,940
Oh, yay.

1504
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,520
Hard.

1505
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,940
Guys, I think we can do hard difficulty.

1506
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,660
I think we can do it.

1507
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,360
It's not gonna go great, guys.

1508
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,200
No, I think we can do it.

1509
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,280
We should show Zeller the robot land.

1510
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:26,720
Yeah, robot!

1511
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,280
Let's go!

1512
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,820
He wants to see the robots.

1513
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,160
If we're going on hard mode, then we probably need like a super special team name, right?

1514
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,020
What's your team name?

1515
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,840
What's it gonna mean?

1516
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,580
Yeah, the hard...

1517
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,840
Yeah, RPR, finish that sentence.

1518
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,180
What did he say?

1519
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,620
Did he say you're getting hard?

1520
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:44,940
What?

1521
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,000
What?

1522
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,940
I'm just... I have no idea what he was talking about.

1523
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,780
Wait, aren't you on Twitch so that people can clip that exact moment of what you just said?

1524
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,360
You can clip on YouTube, too.

1525
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,040
Alright.

1526
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,240
Oh, it's the creek!

1527
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,500
It's time for the creek!

1528
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,500
The creek!

1529
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,440
Here, let's try robots.

1530
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
Are we doing the robots?

1531
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:12,720
Yeah.

1532
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,180
Right?

1533
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,760
We're doing the creek, right?

1534
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,940
Is this the creek?

1535
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,720
Oh, is it the creek?

1536
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,740
No, this is...

1537
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,720
Why not the creek?

1538
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,140
Are you a coward?

1539
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,860
Where's the creek?

1540
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,940
Team what?

1541
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,280
Where is the creek?

1542
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,340
I don't know.

1543
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,040
I don't know.

1544
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,100
I'm not the super citizen.

1545
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,480
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1546
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,520
That's what's going on.

1547
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,720
Let's go to the creek!

1548
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,760
Wait, you lost the creek?

1549
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,000
We lost?

1550
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,620
We lost it.

1551
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,400
Oh my god!

1552
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,560
Yeah, we lost the fucking creek.

1553
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,560
I can't believe it.

1554
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,540
It's your fault, chat.

1555
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,800
You didn't do it for liberty.

1556
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,880
You didn't do it for liberty.

1557
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,340
Poor chat.

1558
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,820
I can't believe it, chat.

1559
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,160
How could you guys do that?

1560
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,480
What happened to liberty and democracy?

1561
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,660
Honestly, it is Pat's fault.

1562
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,060
I don't even know what it means.

1563
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,320
What is this red line?

1564
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,540
I don't know.

1565
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,180
Take us there.

1566
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,700
We can pick where we go.

1567
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,620
No, wait.

1568
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,740
That's a visual bug on my side.

1569
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,100
Not you.

1570
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,120
Not you.

1571
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,320
I can't believe it.

1572
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:25,640
I can't believe it.

1573
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,460
How do I get strong weapons as well, man?

1574
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,080
How do I get strong weapons as well, man?

1575
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,360
You have to spend money to have the strong weapons.

1576
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,380
Ah, fuck that shit.

1577
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,320
No, you don't.

1578
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,780
It's all in-game.

1579
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,780
You unlock it from the ship.

1580
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,980
I already spent $200 on this fucking game.

1581
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,880
It's not paid to win.

1582
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,720
I spent $40 for you.

1583
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,120
I'm gonna shell fucking dinner for you.

1584
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,560
Bro, you could have won that money.

1585
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,060
You could have won that money.

1586
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:57,820
Whatever.

1587
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,360
You're buying everyone dinner, right?

1588
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,700
Yeah, even me, right?

1589
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,920
Who do you guys think you are?

1590
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:06,620
RPR.

1591
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,260
Doki?

1592
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,680
Yeah.

1593
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,460
Wait, why the fuck am I on a fucking- Ah!

1594
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,060
Welcome to the robot land.

1595
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:21,240
Welcome to the robot land.

1596
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,000
Bro, I just got both- Wait, robots?

1597
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,580
Yeah, there's robots.

1598
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,140
Oh, railgun!

1599
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,400
Railgun.

1600
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:31,660
Railgun.

1601
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,880
You're not getting the railgun.

1602
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,240
Railgun.

1603
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,820
Oh shit, perfect!

1604
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,400
I'm gonna get my machine gun.

1605
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:42,640
I killed him.

1606
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,120
I killed him.

1607
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,920
I should have gotten the autocam.

1608
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,780
Oh my god, you just died.

1609
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,500
Are you crazy?

1610
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,260
I threw the needle.

1611
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,920
Holy shit.

1612
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,740
Wait, this is one of the other movies, right?

1613
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,540
What, Terminator?

1614
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,400
Terminator?

1615
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,180
Yeah, they have these robot-looking, Terminator-looking guys.

1616
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:02,860
Yeah.

1617
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,880
Alright, let's go to my ping, guys.

1618
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,280
It's Y2K.

1619
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,220
Hey.

1620
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,440
Let's go.

1621
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,080
Let's go.

1622
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:14,660
Woo.

1623
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,980
I really wanna shoot him.

1624
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,140
I really wanna shoot him.

1625
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,420
Do it.

1626
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:17,880
Do it.

1627
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,140
Do it.

1628
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,000
I mean, you can shoot him in the leg, I guess.

1629
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,580
No!

1630
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,200
Okay, sure, I'll shoot him in the leg.

1631
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,040
Do it.

1632
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,320
Do it.

1633
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:23,580
Do it.

1634
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:23,740
Do it.

1635
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
He's literally right there.

1636
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,040
Wow!

1637
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,880
I shot him with the leg.

1638
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,560
Bro, that was my massive run.

1639
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,840
Holy fuck.

1640
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:35,840
Bro!

1641
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,200
That was his chest.

1642
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,000
I shot him in the leg.

1643
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,300
Just with like a .50 caliber.

1644
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,220
Just with like a .50 caliber.

1645
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,180
Yeah, those bullets definitely went further beyond the leg right there.

1646
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,420
Uh-oh.

1647
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,220
Uh-oh.

1648
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,080
I'll kill you all!

1649
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,620
Holy shit, you guys are popping off.

1650
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,840
Holy shit.

1651
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,660
Hey, come here.

1652
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,760
Press E on this with me.

1653
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,560
Alright.

1654
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,560
What is this?

1655
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,880
It's a bunker.

1656
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,040
Oh, there's grenades.

1657
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:10,660
Wee!

1658
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,100
Open up!

1659
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,960
Uh...

1660
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,060
Wow, there's some cool loot in here.

1661
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,500
I'll take it.

1662
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,560
Thank you.

1663
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,360
Thank you.

1664
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,180
Thank you.

1665
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:25,980
Thank you.

1666
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,280
Alright, see you guys later.

1667
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,840
This is my stream now.

1668
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,280
What was she doing?

1669
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,620
She clutched your kick.

1670
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,880
Another diamond!

1671
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,340
Woo!

1672
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,700
What were you thinking?

1673
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,620
What do you think was gonna happen?

1674
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,260
Well...

1675
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,640
The problem was that I wasn't really thinking.

1676
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,580
I can't believe you've done this.

1677
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,380
I can't believe you've done this.

1678
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,720
I can't believe you've done this.

1679
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,600
Solo season 2.

1680
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,240
I'm solo.

1681
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,860
I'm solo.

1682
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,320
Oh my god!

1683
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,240
Wait, I realized I can play that now.

1684
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,760
I can play on this.

1685
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,780
Open up!

1686
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,100
Oh shit!

1687
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,000
They got blind!

1688
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,340
Watch out.

1689
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:11,640
Watch out.

1690
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,000
Watch out.

1691
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:12,460
Watch out.

1692
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:12,980
Watch out.

1693
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,020
Watch out.

1694
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,300
Watch out.

1695
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,160
I'm watching.

1696
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:14,600
I'm watching.

1697
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:14,960
I'm watching.

1698
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,540
Uh...

1699
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,760
I mean, I did warn him.

1700
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,400
Yeah, I don't think he watched out.

1701
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,060
Not me specifically.

1702
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,300
He said he was watching.

1703
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,820
Yeah, we did watch.

1704
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,620
Yeah.

1705
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,640
Who's reinforcing him?

1706
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,160
I killed like 10 of them though.

1707
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,900
At least you're watching, you know.

1708
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,380
Yeah.

1709
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,800
Did he actually kill 10 of them?

1710
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,680
I don't think he did.

1711
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:40,980
I did!

1712
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:41,960
I did!

1713
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,360
Alright, we got it.

1714
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,600
Oh wait, it's puzzle time!

1715
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,040
It's puzzle time!

1716
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,120
Do the puzzle!

1717
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,000
Do the thing!

1718
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:55,820
Go for it.

1719
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,220
Go for it.

1720
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,920
You've got massive brain of yours.

1721
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,180
No, you have to spin the radar dish.

1722
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,300
Wait, oh yeah.

1723
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,700
Wait, we can spin it now?

1724
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,480
No, no we can't.

1725
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1726
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,300
Okay, don't worry.

1727
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:09,960
I can spin it.

1728
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:10,580
I know.

1729
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,180
Wait, wait, wait.

1730
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,980
Oh shit, there's big...

1731
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,160
There's big robots!

1732
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,400
I can kill those.

1733
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,980
Do you spin it from over here?

1734
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,660
No, you spin it here where I am right now.

1735
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,440
Oh, I can spin it!

1736
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,280
Okay, how do you do this?

1737
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,460
Am I spinning it?

1738
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:28,820
I'll let you know.

1739
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,340
I'll let you know.

1740
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,260
Okay.

1741
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:30,480
Oh my god.

1742
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,140
Am I doing it?

1743
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,520
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1744
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,280
Am I doing it?

1745
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,180
Stop, stop, stop.

1746
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,780
Stop, stop, stop.

1747
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,960
I give you a countdown for a reason!

1748
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,120
We did it!

1749
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,660
How do I get off?

1750
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,220
Okay, I got it.

1751
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,080
Yay!

1752
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:52,260
Yay!

1753
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,020
Where are we going?

1754
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,520
We gotta destroy the ships right here.

1755
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,140
Okay.

1756
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,360
Alright, leave it to me.

1757
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,620
Leave it to us.

1758
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,600
It's a team game.

1759
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,020
Hey, that looks like a grenade you just threw.

1760
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,140
Wait, I got it.

1761
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,340
I know what to do.

1762
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,980
It's a nuclear bomb I just threw.

1763
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,480
I threw a cluster bomb.

1764
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,000
Run, run, run, run!

1765
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,020
Oh my god, are you crazy?

1766
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,740
What do you mean?

1767
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,560
What does that do?

1768
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,560
Look, see?

1769
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,120
Wow.

1770
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,440
Look at that, it was beautiful.

1771
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,100
It's like fireworks.

1772
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,160
I think it's cooler than RPRs.

1773
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:29,780
What do you mean?

1774
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,680
I dropped a nuke.

1775
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,460
There was more explosions though.

1776
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,320
Yeah, but mine was like big.

1777
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:35,780
Yeah, see?

1778
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,460
It killed everything.

1779
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:39,960
Nice.

1780
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,460
This is so easy.

1781
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,580
Look at us.

1782
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,300
We're working together.

1783
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,920
Oh, behind me, behind me, behind me!

1784
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,040
Good luck.

1785
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,440
Behind him, guys.

1786
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,440
Ah, shit!

1787
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,340
Guys!

1788
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,400
Guys, why are we all split up?

1789
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,520
Wait, how did I die?

1790
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,760
Help us!

1791
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,500
Guys, the baby needs help.

1792
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,660
The baby needs help.

1793
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:06,280
The baby needs help.

1794
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,680
Let's kill them all now.

1795
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,240
We're back.

1796
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,080
We're back.

1797
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,420
I got you, I got you.

1798
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,520
See, look at us, working together.

1799
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, this guy got flamethrowers and shit.

1800
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,140
I'm fucking blasting.

1801
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,780
It's a Hulk, it's a Hulk.

1802
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,160
Wait, this guy ain't taking damage.

1803
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,740
It's okay, I'm throwing a nade.

1804
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,520
I'm throwing a nade.

1805
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,500
Your nades aren't reliable.

1806
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,420
What do you mean?

1807
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,980
I just really don't think the Hulk.

1808
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,200
I'm throwing another nade.

1809
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:32,820
Oh, behind us.

1810
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:32,880
Oh, no.

1811
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,900
Oh, no.

1812
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm stimming.

1813
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,340
Oh my god, it's AT&T.

1814
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,560
AT&T?

1815
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,120
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

1816
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,760
Maybe I don't, but I kinda got you.

1817
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,400
No!

1818
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,360
Guys, I don't think he got you.

1819
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,220
Dude, there were five of them behind you, bro.

1820
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,520
What am I meant to do against five dudes?

1821
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,220
Like, wave my hand at them?

1822
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,160
You had me, man.

1823
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,560
Come on.

1824
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,680
Yeah, you had him.

1825
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,480
You could've done it.

1826
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,760
No, I didn't have him.

1827
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,800
Why did you say you had him?

1828
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,000
Were you lying?

1829
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,140
Maybe she can handle five guys, but I can't handle five guys.

1830
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:08,420
Okay?

1831
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,760
There's a difference.

1832
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,300
Ooh, auto-channeled backslash.

1833
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,820
Wait, what's your limit for?

1834
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,020
I would run away.

1835
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,340
I would run away.

1836
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:20,840
Run away.

1837
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,220
Why are we running, yo?

1838
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,000
Why are we running?

1839
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,580
Whoa, shit!

1840
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,060
We did it, we did it, we did it!

1841
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:32,620
Whoa!

1842
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,080
What was that, man?

1843
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,140
Wait, who are we missing?

1844
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,780
Who are we missing right now?

1845
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,420
I don't know.

1846
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,780
Who did you guys kill earlier?

1847
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:40,800
Oh, shit!

1848
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,380
It's mine!

1849
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,420
Hey guys, can you bring me back?

1850
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,860
Wait, Zeller, if you come here, look at this red shit.

1851
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:49,900
No!

1852
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,060
I step on it and I die, right?

1853
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,760
I'm not that dumb.

1854
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,560
No, no, that's loot.

1855
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,200
That's loot.

1856
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,940
Dude, there's a tank!

1857
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,960
I gotta do this for us.

1858
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,720
I gotta do this for us.

1859
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,880
Yeah, that's...

1860
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,180
Holy cow, that shit's real!

1861
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,520
I think I destroyed it.

1862
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,620
I threw nades at it.

1863
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,200
I destroyed the tank!

1864
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:09,760
Run!

1865
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,980
Oh my god, what is going on?

1866
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:14,740
Don't worry, I'm here now.

1867
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,200
Oh, that's a tank, that's a tank, that's a tank.

1868
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,060
I got my auto-nade.

1869
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,520
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1870
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,880
No, the nades don't work!

1871
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,160
I have a strike, I have a strike, I have a strike!

1872
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,660
Okay, okay, okay.

1873
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,780
I have a strike, it's going down!

1874
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,260
I have a strike too!

1875
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,400
Throw everything, throw everything at the tank.

1876
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:33,840
Let's do it, let's do it!

1877
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,560
We got this!

1878
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,700
We did it, Zeller!

1879
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:38,860
Zeller, we did it!

1880
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,940
We went to mine!

1881
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,280
The fucking mine!

1882
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,540
I stepped on a mine!

1883
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:45,700
No!

1884
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,840
Guys, there's a tank.

1885
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,120
I stepped on a fucking mine!

1886
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,000
I got one of the tanks!

1887
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,620
I did my job.

1888
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,880
I saw the tanks blow up, I got so happy, ran back and stepped on a fucking mine!

1889
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,760
Yeah, you can shoot the mine.

1890
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,520
Yes, that's what I'm doing!

1891
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,540
We can just walk around it.

1892
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,880
No more mines.

1893
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,840
Just don't walk into the red thing.

1894
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,300
Yeah, you know, normal people would just not die to it.

1895
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,240
Yeah, yeah, what are you trying to do?

1896
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,760
What are you trying to do, Zeller?

1897
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,260
What are you trying to do?

1898
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:16,740
We're built different.

1899
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,920
Let's walk this way, guys.

1900
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,420
Wait, Zeller has the Uber Eats!

1901
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,040
Huh?

1902
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,960
Uber Eats what?

1903
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:24,940
Look at him!

1904
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,820
He has the Uber Eats!

1905
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,740
I'll ring the doorbell and be like, hey, yo, what's up, baby girl?

1906
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,260
Let me get your Instagram.

1907
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,280
Let me get your Instagram.

1908
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,140
Is this what you think happens for Uber Eats?

1909
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,020
Is this what you think happens for Uber Eats?

1910
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,260
Is this what you think happens for Uber Eats?

1911
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:40,440
Look at him!

1912
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:40,620
Look at him!

1913
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,000
All the Uber Eats that I've ordered, they've been really nice to me.

1914
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,400
I've never had an asshole, except one who didn't come and ate the food.

1915
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,580
So, like, your Uber Eats people, like, go up to you and ask for your Instagram?

1916
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,460
No, they don't!

1917
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,420
Oh, what's that?

1918
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,000
Oh, my eyesight's blurry.

1919
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,820
I can't see anything.

1920
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,160
Return back to combat!

1921
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,540
Traitor detected!

1922
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,100
Did we all die?

1923
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,400
Killed by Zellers.

1924
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,400
By Zellers?

1925
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:10,640
Zellers?

1926
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,900
I said I died by Zellers!

1927
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,380
By Zellers?

1928
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,420
Look, I'm killing everyone, okay?

1929
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:23,840
Look, I'm killing everyone, okay?

1930
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,920
Yes, including us, apparently.

1931
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,560
No, they're flying!

1932
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,680
I got you, I got you, I got you.

1933
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,140
I got you, I got you, I got you.

1934
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,880
I got you, guys.

1935
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,260
I got you.

1936
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,820
Bro, he's gonna fucking die.

1937
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,880
Bro, I need to know Zellers team damage.

1938
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,840
I need to know.

1939
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,260
You leave the combat zone.

1940
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,980
The ship's above us.

1941
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,660
They're gonna start shooting missiles at you.

1942
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,300
So then, I'm guessing that...

1943
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,440
I'm guessing that Zellers...

1944
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,880
I was right in front of them, bro.

1945
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:53,520
I was right in front of them, bro.

1946
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,320
What the fuck?

1947
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,760
Why is my vision blurry?

1948
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,860
You literally said that to us.

1949
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,640
What do you mean?

1950
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,200
What?

1951
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,100
No, um...

1952
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,420
I'm aging, you know?

1953
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,960
Just follow me, man.

1954
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,120
How did I also age?

1955
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,960
We didn't fucking get bombed!

1956
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,400
Huh?

1957
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,100
Aging, not Asian!

1958
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,500
I thought he said...

1959
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,680
Oh my god.

1960
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,920
Oh my god.

1961
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,920
Oh my god.

1962
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,380
Everyone accepts RPR is gonna be blurry.

1963
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,800
But then RPR is like...

1964
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,760
RPR is like aging aging.

1965
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,040
So he'll be blurry too.

1966
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,660
So in the end, we'll all be...

1967
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,480
Uninstall the stream.

1968
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,040
Run back!

1969
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,660
There's a bomb!

1970
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,860
Where do we go?

1971
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,680
Oh shit!

1972
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,660
There was a nuclear bomb.

1973
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,020
Why didn't anyone talk about it?

1974
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,420
Because I threw it away from you guys.

1975
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,320
So you guys can't die.

1976
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,980
Oh, that's so sweet.

1977
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:57,140
Oh, Terminator boys!

1978
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,000
It's okay, we're fine.

1979
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,120
We just better... Watch out behind!

1980
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:01,720
There's so many!

1981
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,320
There's so many!

1982
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:03,840
And here we go!

1983
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,540
I have no ammo!

1984
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,100
I'm dead guys.

1985
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,960
No!

1986
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:11,800
I'm running!

1987
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,560
I only have a grenade!

1988
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,160
I'm going grenade!

1989
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,420
I missed.

1990
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,820
I missed.

1991
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,940
Spawn us in, please.

1992
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,140
What do you mean?

1993
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,340
We're doing so well!

1994
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:27,940
Check inside!

1995
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,300
Check inside!

1996
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,720
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1997
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,120
I'm checking.

1998
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,700
What was that?

1999
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:33,040
What was that?

2000
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:33,840
My chest is bleeding!

2001
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,540
What was that?

2002
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:35,920
What was that?

2003
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,540
I have a stim.

2004
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,460
There's a guy with a big shield.

2005
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,140
We need to kill him.

2006
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:41,580
That guy is strong.

2007
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,100
I got you.

2008
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:42,400
I got you.

2009
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,580
Don't go anywhere near that.

2010
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,140
I got you.

2011
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:44,580
I got you too.

2012
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,300
I got you.

2013
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:45,940
Run, run, run, run!

2014
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:46,960
I think I got him.

2015
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,520
I got you.

2016
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,820
I just shot him.

2017
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,280
I just shot him.

2018
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,180
He's still alive.

2019
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:51,840
He's still alive.

2020
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,300
I see him.

2021
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,100
Don't go near that.

2022
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:53,540
Don't go near that.

2023
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,220
Don't go near what?

2024
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,200
No, go, go.

2025
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:55,800
He's dead.

2026
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,300
He's dead.

2027
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,460
You're a horrible person.

2028
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,020
He is dead.

2029
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,360
What do you mean?

2030
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,820
I'll never die.

2031
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:06,960
He was dead.

2032
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,100
I was telling the truth.

2033
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,740
Oh, shit, guys!

2034
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,540
Okay, I'm going to get another machine gun.

2035
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,240
I got you.

2036
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:15,620
I'm on fire.

2037
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,000
What the fuck?

2038
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,420
Oh, shit.

2039
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:17,860
Oh, shit.

2040
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,220
There's more.

2041
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,000
I only have a pistol.

2042
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:19,840
I only have a pistol.

2043
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,580
I only have a pistol.

2044
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,240
Zellar, get away from me!

2045
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,520
I'm staying near you so you get the fucking...

2046
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,860
My machine gun is literally coming down.

2047
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:31,820
My machine gun is literally coming down.

2048
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:31,920
Yay.

2049
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,200
You guys are doing great.

2050
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,220
You're doing great, guys.

2051
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:35,880
We're doing it.

2052
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,640
We have like four left.

2053
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,340
Okay, I got another machine gun.

2054
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:40,680
Objective.

2055
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,600
We got to go to objective.

2056
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:42,320
I got an orbital strike.

2057
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,480
Orbital strike coming.

2058
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,060
ATT!

2059
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:44,560
ATT!

2060
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,880
No, no, no, no.

2061
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,800
Return to tactical zone.

2062
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,480
No, we have to return.

2063
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,660
Oh, no!

2064
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:53,980
I'm getting hit.

2065
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:55,840
I'm good.

2066
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,100
I'm good.

2067
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:56,360
I'm good.

2068
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:56,840
No bullets.

2069
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,220
I have no... I need more bullets.

2070
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,040
I need more bullets.

2071
01:01:59,060 --> 01:01:59,700
I need more bullets.

2072
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,140
Why are you shooting me?

2073
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,780
I'm shooting behind you.

2074
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:03,800
Okay, I'm going to get...

2075
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,380
Where's... Where's RPI?

2076
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,880
We need to get to RPI.

2077
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,240
I'm leaving you guys, bro.

2078
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,140
I'm leaving you guys.

2079
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,620
Machine gun.

2080
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,500
20 seconds, guys, okay?

2081
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,520
I'm running towards him.

2082
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,460
I'm going to get to you guys.

2083
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,600
You're running from the supplies.

2084
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:18,660
I'm running.

2085
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,440
Over here.

2086
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,980
I don't need ammo.

2087
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,920
We don't need ammo.

2088
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,340
We're so good.

2089
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:23,900
I want my life.

2090
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,140
We have resupply.

2091
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,820
We have resupply.

2092
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,040
We don't need bullets.

2093
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,000
We don't need bullets.

2094
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,400
Okay.

2095
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,060
I have my machine...

2096
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,180
My heavy machine gun.

2097
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,860
He just wants to give you guys some ammo.

2098
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,580
They were like, oh, I don't have any bullets.

2099
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,320
I don't have any bullets.

2100
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,520
I wanted to give them bullets.

2101
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,220
I have machine gun now.

2102
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,100
And I have grenades.

2103
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:45,880
Okay.

2104
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,320
We got this.

2105
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:48,780
Just believe in us.

2106
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,300
Here's the thing.

2107
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,300
If we run away, we don't need ammo.

2108
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,780
I'm not going to lie.

2109
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,140
I gave up when you guys went away.

2110
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,100
I just started running away.

2111
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,760
You're a horrible person.

2112
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,480
How could you?

2113
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,560
You should revoke your super citizen.

2114
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,020
You're not a super citizen.

2115
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,040
You don't help others.

2116
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,440
Because instead of...

2117
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,440
Yeah?

2118
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:09,560
Go.

2119
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:10,440
Instead of what?

2120
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,660
One second.

2121
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,620
I was throwing a nuclear bomb.

2122
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,620
Instead of fucking around with you guys, I'm liberating.

2123
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,640
We're liberating too.

2124
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,040
You're liberating your brain cells.

2125
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,540
What do you mean?

2126
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,000
We're liberating.

2127
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,680
We're doing our part.

2128
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,640
I'm doing my part.

2129
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,820
I'm doing my part too.

2130
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:31,920
Being happy.

2131
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,420
We're here now.

2132
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:33,740
See?

2133
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:34,400
We're here.

2134
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,700
Thanks for coming guys.

2135
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:38,520
That's right.

2136
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,500
That was not me.

2137
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,460
Just so you know.

2138
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,800
That was not me.

2139
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,400
I got you.

2140
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:47,820
I got you.

2141
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:48,280
I got you.

2142
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:48,960
Nice.

2143
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,480
Oh, mine.

2144
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:52,820
Land mine.

2145
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:53,620
I got you.

2146
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,020
I got you.

2147
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,660
No, I'm already dead.

2148
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,940
The land mine got me already.

2149
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,320
Oh shit.

2150
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,540
I'm burning.

2151
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:01,680
I'm burning.

2152
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,380
Someone get me too.

2153
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,120
Someone get me too.

2154
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,840
Okay, when you start burning, just heal.

2155
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,200
And it will heal the blood.

2156
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,380
Why can't I stop drop and roll?

2157
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:14,100
Why can't I stop drop and roll?

2158
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:14,900
Why can't I stop drop and roll?

2159
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,040
That's not how it works in this world.

2160
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:17,620
What?

2161
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,840
So it was all alive?

2162
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,320
I got the machine gun.

2163
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,760
It works on Earth.

2164
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,940
Just not on the fuck where we are.

2165
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:26,320
Different atmosphere.

2166
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:28,880
Okay, we're fine.

2167
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,660
I'm throwing a nade.

2168
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,480
Oh, there's a big guy.

2169
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:34,780
Big guy.

2170
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,140
Big guy.

2171
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:35,800
Oh, hey.

2172
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,720
Let me...

2173
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:38,620
He's fine.

2174
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,020
I said I'm throwing a nade.

2175
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:42,960
I said...

2176
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,240
What are you throwing?

2177
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,500
Look at his loot.

2178
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:46,440
I'm taking his loot.

2179
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:48,840
I'm taking his loot too.

2180
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:49,860
Oh, railgun.

2181
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:51,900
Oh, fuck.

2182
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:52,580
I didn't count.

2183
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,900
Oh, you thought you had it.

2184
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,040
You thought you could.

2185
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,740
You thought you could kill us.

2186
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,720
Bro, I look like...

2187
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,540
Bro, you ran into my nade.

2188
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,980
And then you guys just robbed me.

2189
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,240
Bro, you ran into my nade.

2190
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,520
What do you want me to do?

2191
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,120
It's called putting into a trust fund when you die.

2192
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,580
I need more bullets.

2193
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,800
Oh man, if only you went to the supply thing that I gave you.

2194
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,120
Yeah, if only you went there.

2195
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,580
Look, I was saving you.

2196
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:18,860
Mine.

2197
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,020
I stepped on it, but it didn't go off.

2198
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,000
Look at us.

2199
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:28,700
We're doing great.

2200
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:29,900
I think we're doing pretty well.

2201
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:30,320
Resupply.

2202
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,780
I got the resupply too.

2203
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:34,960
We don't need them.

2204
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,140
Yes, we do.

2205
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,040
I'm going to objective.

2206
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:42,940
Where's the objective?

2207
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,100
Right in front of us.

2208
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,520
Okay, what do we have to do?

2209
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,720
We have to destroy AirBase control tower.

2210
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,140
This is one of the harder ones.

2211
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,760
This is going to be fun.

2212
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,160
What difficulty are we on?

2213
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,540
Hard mode right now.

2214
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,900
Oh, this is hard?

2215
01:05:59,040 --> 01:05:59,880
It's so easy.

2216
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,080
It's easy, I know.

2217
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,060
It was so easy.

2218
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,680
If you guys didn't team kill each other, it would be a lot easier.

2219
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,580
See, you killed yourself.

2220
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,260
You killed yourself.

2221
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:12,560
I got burned to death because I'm too busy talking to you dumbass.

2222
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:12,820
Why did you heal?

2223
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,500
We can turn it down on difficulty if you want.

2224
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,220
Why did you heal, RPR?

2225
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,500
What happened to healing?

2226
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,680
We're cool with hard difficulty.

2227
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,140
Yeah, apparently.

2228
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,040
He died like two times in a row.

2229
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,600
You guys are not real.

2230
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:28,100
Don't go near that.

2231
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,180
Woah, woah, woah.

2232
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,700
I'm going to run away.

2233
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,700
Woah, woah, woah.

2234
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,840
Look at this, there's a turret gun.

2235
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:38,900
I'm on a turret gun.

2236
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:39,840
Holy shit.

2237
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,900
Wow, get everybody that's behind us.

2238
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,000
Alright, we're here.

2239
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:43,380
I'm here.

2240
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,520
There's no one behind us.

2241
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,400
I'm here.

2242
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,280
I'm doing my part.

2243
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,320
Yeah, you guys are fighting ghosts behind us while I'm liberating this tower.

2244
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,840
You don't know what's in front of you.

2245
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,540
Woah, there's actual people in front of us.

2246
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,700
Woah, woah, woah.

2247
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:00,940
I just did rocket launcher.

2248
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,360
RPR, you died again.

2249
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,780
I got you, I got you.

2250
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,280
I got rocket launcher.

2251
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,480
What just killed me?

2252
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,120
How did we go over there, Doki?

2253
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:11,800
Right here.

2254
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:17,200
Let me watch the real content.

2255
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:17,640
Let me watch the real content.

2256
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,920
Oh my god, he fell off.

2257
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,380
Wait, how do I...

2258
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:21,820
Okay, reload.

2259
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2260
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,600
I'm trying to figure out how to use this really good.

2261
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,780
Easy money, easy money.

2262
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:27,500
Cash money.

2263
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,620
Oh, you shot me.

2264
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,920
No, I shot the robot.

2265
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:31,760
I shot the robot.

2266
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,780
No, no, I did.

2267
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,660
I shot a robot.

2268
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,420
He's dead.

2269
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,520
I did my part.

2270
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:38,520
How much?

2271
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,860
44 seconds?

2272
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,220
RPR, you need to stop dying.

2273
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,540
We don't have enough trees to die.

2274
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,400
You guys say that 15 times.

2275
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,260
Look at us.

2276
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,360
RPRC, we're cooking.

2277
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,300
I'm grenade-ing.

2278
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,220
That's not a good grenade.

2279
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,080
You're gonna kill us.

2280
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,880
What the fuck do you mean?

2281
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,340
You nearly killed us on solo out here.

2282
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,500
I'm doing my best.

2283
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,220
Greeter shot first, and Greeter is Doki.

2284
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,800
I mean, you didn't die.

2285
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:10,780
You ran away.

2286
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:12,920
Wow!

2287
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,080
Oh my god, oh my god.

2288
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,440
I got shot by your fucking...

2289
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,600
I got shot by a fucking robot drone.

2290
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:18,520
Nice.

2291
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,700
Turret, turret, turret.

2292
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:22,960
Use the turret.

2293
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,040
Where are they?

2294
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,100
I got it.

2295
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,100
I don't know how to use it correctly.

2296
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,320
I don't know if there's any on this side.

2297
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:30,800
There is.

2298
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:31,760
I got one guy.

2299
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,080
Nice.

2300
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,760
Oh my god.

2301
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,500
They're fucking falling from the skies.

2302
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:36,640
Where are they?

2303
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,020
It's okay, guys.

2304
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,540
I'm killing everybody on my side.

2305
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,880
I'm not encountering anyone.

2306
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,940
Why is that?

2307
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:44,460
It's okay.

2308
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:44,920
I did it.

2309
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:45,680
I killed like 20.

2310
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:48,760
Oh man.

2311
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:49,640
Welcome back.

2312
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,480
I'll do the mission, guys.

2313
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:50,900
Don't worry.

2314
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:51,980
You guys keep killing.

2315
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,440
I put the hard drive in.

2316
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:59,160
I don't know where I am or who I am, but I know I'm here to kill.

2317
01:08:59,160 --> 01:08:59,600
I'm gonna follow you.

2318
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,860
You know what to do.

2319
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:01,660
I'm gonna follow you.

2320
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:03,560
Where are you?

2321
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:04,640
We're just waiting.

2322
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,360
Oh, Zeller, do the thing.

2323
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,200
I believe in you.

2324
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,240
He did it!

2325
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,300
Good job, bro.

2326
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,700
Good job, Zeller.

2327
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,260
See?

2328
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:15,900
Leave it to me, man.

2329
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:16,540
Leave it to me.

2330
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:19,380
Zeller is important to this team.

2331
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,380
Okay, let's do this.

2332
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:21,920
Are we doing it?

2333
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,100
Oh yeah, now...

2334
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:25,760
Now what?

2335
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,480
Now shoot this guy.

2336
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,560
I got you guys, too.

2337
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:32,420
Reloading.

2338
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:32,800
Reloading.

2339
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Mission complete!

2340
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,300
Nice!

2341
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:38,940
Mission complete.

2342
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:39,420
Easy.

2343
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:43,360
Let's go.

2344
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,000
Now we just run.

2345
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,200
We're heading to the next area.

2346
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,340
Yep, I'm just done with it.

2347
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,820
What do you mean we don't fly?

2348
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,100
White hair is from stress.

2349
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,220
He's already white-haired.

2350
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:53,700
Jump!

2351
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,480
There's fall damage.

2352
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,400
I got the turret.

2353
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,020
Oh!

2354
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,020
An explosion killed me.

2355
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2356
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:07,520
No!

2357
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,120
I got you.

2358
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,600
I don't know.

2359
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,220
An explosion.

2360
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,660
What just killed us?

2361
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:13,520
I don't know.

2362
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,140
An explosion.

2363
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,320
I think it was RPR's thingy.

2364
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,520
No, it wasn't.

2365
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,720
It was something from behind us.

2366
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:20,740
Yeah, something exploded.

2367
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,640
I got hit by it, too, but we're fine now.

2368
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,040
It's okay.

2369
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:25,500
Well, I'm not.

2370
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,140
I'm dead.

2371
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,140
We have reinforcements.

2372
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,100
Reinforcements.

2373
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,520
We got rocketed from behind.

2374
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:33,840
Han?

2375
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:35,160
It's Zeller.

2376
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:36,760
Oh, it's Han.

2377
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,520
How did he do that?

2378
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,140
He's so cheeky right now.

2379
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:42,780
He's a cheeky little guy.

2380
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,580
I didn't do that.

2381
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:49,160
The moment he used that voice, that voice right there, you know.

2382
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:50,120
You know.

2383
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,180
He used that voice.

2384
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,440
Listen.

2385
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:56,380
If the world hates me, maybe I'll hate the world.

2386
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:00,680
He lived long enough to become a villain.

2387
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:02,700
Okay, Kevin.

2388
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:03,020
You're not.

2389
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,420
He's dead.

2390
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,620
Wait, it's coming from the south.

2391
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,260
There's a huge tower that's been shooting us.

2392
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,660
That's what shot us then.

2393
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,000
It's coming from the south.

2394
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,700
It sure is.

2395
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,540
Don't pick that tower.

2396
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,080
That's too strong.

2397
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,660
Oh god.

2398
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,420
Oh god.

2399
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,900
We have to live for one minute.

2400
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:22,420
Han!

2401
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,180
Han, do you have enough heals?

2402
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,360
We're good.

2403
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:26,600
We're good.

2404
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,380
Are we?

2405
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,920
I'm gonna try to orbital it.

2406
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:32,660
What the?

2407
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,600
I don't think you can orbital it.

2408
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:35,920
Oh no.

2409
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,500
Oh no.

2410
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,360
I'm so scared.

2411
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,120
Han!

2412
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:40,860
Don't be scared.

2413
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,560
We must do this.

2414
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,420
It's up to you.

2415
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:45,980
Han Solo!

2416
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,500
It's up to you!

2417
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,760
It's up to you!

2418
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:52,960
Holy shit!

2419
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:53,560
Look at him go!

2420
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,600
Look at him go!

2421
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,880
Oh shit, from the front as well.

2422
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,060
Oh my god.

2423
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:01,940
Oh my god, they're everywhere.

2424
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:02,880
They're everywhere.

2425
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,340
Holy shit, look at this gamer!

2426
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,340
Why is he gaming?

2427
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:06,720
You have no stims.

2428
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,440
He has no more stims.

2429
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,200
20 seconds!

2430
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,680
Run to the fort.

2431
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,940
What are you doing?

2432
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,000
Gathering my breath.

2433
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,380
He's so fucked.

2434
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:19,420
He is so fucked.

2435
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,960
He's so fucked.

2436
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,480
He's so fucked.

2437
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,680
We're gonna be alright.

2438
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,260
5 seconds.

2439
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,740
What the fuck?

2440
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:31,860
Holy shit.

2441
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,820
Go, go, go, go!

2442
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:35,220
No!

2443
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:36,500
Oh wait, can he?

2444
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,480
This guy is an anime protagonist!

2445
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:41,380
Clutch your kid!

2446
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,100
He's an anime protagonist!

2447
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,400
Holy shit, he's cooking!

2448
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,000
Those 10 hours!

2449
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,160
He's a gamer!

2450
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,540
He's a gamer!

2451
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,820
Oh my god, he's like...

2452
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,920
He's glitching.

2453
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,820
Oh, he got shot in the crotch!

2454
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,340
Oh my god.

2455
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,020
What are you doing?

2456
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:01,840
Why are you just holding the camera?

2457
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:02,380
Why are you holding that out?

2458
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,640
Oh my god!

2459
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:09,040
It would be so sad if RPR dies.

2460
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,560
Mr. RPR just chill before he finds Solo.

2461
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,560
He has no meds and no nothing.

2462
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:14,860
He has no meds and no nothing.

2463
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,820
It would be so sad if RPR dies.

2464
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,720
While Zelen has lived for so long.

2465
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,500
While Zelen has lived for so long.

2466
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,180
I'm not gonna die, okay?

2467
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:23,860
I'm a professional.

2468
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,560
That's a flag right there, bro.

2469
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:26,760
That's a flag right there, bro.

2470
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,840
Mother, RPR is the type of guy who's gonna die.

2471
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,500
I'm gonna tell the fucking dude next to him.

2472
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,860
After this war, let's go back happily to our family.

2473
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:38,820
After this war, let's go back happily to our family.

2474
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:38,820
He died!

2475
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,440
I told you!

2476
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,000
He died!

2477
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:43,960
I told you!

2478
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:44,260
He died!

2479
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:44,260
I told you!

2480
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,920
RPR worked so hard for this!

2481
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,760
Holy shit!

2482
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:48,680
RPR, what happened?

2483
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,120
RPR worked so hard for you to live!

2484
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,460
As soon as I said that phrase, RPR worked so hard for you to live!

2485
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,700
After this war, let's go back to our family now.

2486
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,500
I juked myself a little bit, but you fucking fucked me until the end.

2487
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,060
I'm not gonna lie, RPR got me dead.

2488
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,100
Oh my god.

2489
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,080
You just made the jinxed enchantment stronger.

2490
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:11,580
It's extraction!

2491
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,640
You might as well have all the life, girl!

2492
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,280
What?!

2493
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,940
You stepped on the smelly bomb.

2494
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,320
Go go go!

2495
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:18,620
Just run!

2496
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:21,780
That's the plan.

2497
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:26,720
Forixx seconds, and you get the bestie main- Who, me?

2498
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,080
The soaps hasn't team killed anybody.

2499
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,340
Dude, leave it to me bro.

2500
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,600
I got you man.

2501
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,380
How do you guys know 15 seconds and shit?

2502
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,680
Cause it's on the top left!

2503
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,380
Oh, I'm back bitches.

2504
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,520
Leave it to me.

2505
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:43,720
Well no, if it's Zeller I don't really wanna bring him back.

2506
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,580
Apparently the one that's like a one day away from retirement.

2507
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,740
What the fuck is this bot drop?

2508
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,740
Why are they calling me a bot bro?

2509
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,240
Zeller, do not land on Han.

2510
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,620
He worked so hard to get here.

2511
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:56,100
Uh oh.

2512
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,840
Are you healed up?

2513
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,420
Yeah, yeah, he's healed up.

2514
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,660
He's good now.

2515
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,800
Oh my god, just 1 minute and 36 seconds.

2516
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,520
Just keep going to extraction point.

2517
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,160
You're so close.

2518
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:14,820
Actually don't even know.

2519
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,820
We're not close, we still have to wait 2 minutes.

2520
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,020
Not very good.

2521
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,340
You know what?

2522
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,300
Maybe I don't need you anymore.

2523
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:24,700
No!

2524
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,580
Put him down all the other style.

2525
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:34,280
Just like as the ship is dropping down, you're like, you know what?

2526
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,720
This was a solo mission.

2527
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,300
I'm just gonna spectate Zeller's because I know he's gonna provide content.

2528
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,680
Fuck you mean?

2529
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,700
I ain't got no content.

2530
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,320
How do I slide?

2531
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,840
How do I slide?

2532
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:47,940
It's alt.

2533
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,680
It's alt, you mean like...

2534
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,920
Oh shit, people in front of us guys.

2535
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:55,760
Careful, careful, careful.

2536
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:58,140
I wanna be careful but I can't.

2537
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,340
There's an orbital strike, Zeller.

2538
01:15:59,480 --> 01:15:59,980
Be careful.

2539
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,340
It's not hitting the single person I'm trying to shoot.

2540
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,260
Wait, did he die?

2541
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:09,560
Die!

2542
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,600
Don't die, don't die, don't die.

2543
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,020
Just run, just run, just run.

2544
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:15,300
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.

2545
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,540
Just run, just run.

2546
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,760
Dive you little bitch, dive you little bitch.

2547
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,020
Why is there a fucking tank over here?

2548
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,600
Just run, just run.

2549
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:23,280
Go back.

2550
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,640
I think you were better off solo.

2551
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,620
Don't go back.

2552
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,800
Zeller, don't go back.

2553
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,000
Watch me.

2554
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,520
10 seconds.

2555
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,020
I'm back.

2556
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,560
If you respawn me, I'm gonna be back and we're...

2557
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,520
What do I do to respawn you, bro?

2558
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,180
We're like the dream team.

2559
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:45,160
Do it now, do it now.

2560
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,060
Do it now, do it now.

2561
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,120
Okay.

2562
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,660
Respawn, how the fuck do I respawn?

2563
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:52,580
Lift up.

2564
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:53,520
So close.

2565
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:56,800
Okay, so you know how you were subbing strategies?

2566
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,120
It's so hard.

2567
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:58,240
So, I'll just...

2568
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:58,480
No!

2569
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,240
Heal, heal, heal.

2570
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,380
Heal, heal.

2571
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,560
I can't keep you.

2572
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,380
No, he's dead.

2573
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:03,620
She's dead.

2574
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,340
Heal, die.

2575
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:05,140
Heal.

2576
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,260
You're dead.

2577
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:06,680
You're dead.

2578
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:07,620
We're back!

2579
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:08,320
No!

2580
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,440
Oh no!

2581
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,000
Doki, you're a final hug.

2582
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:12,400
Oh you're alone.

2583
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:13,780
Oh god, oh god.

2584
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:14,680
You're alone, buddy.

2585
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,520
Don't feel alone.

2586
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,480
I don't wanna be alone.

2587
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,320
Doki1, Kenobi, you're our only hug.

2588
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,220
Oh, we're so...

2589
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:23,020
We were doing so good, and then...

2590
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:23,180
We were doing so good, I don't wanna be alone.

2591
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,540
You were not doing good at all, you killed him.

2592
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,780
I'm so scared!

2593
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,960
I'm so scared!

2594
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,760
I'm so scared!

2595
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,000
One minute, one minute, one minute.

2596
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:34,460
Okay, okay.

2597
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,380
Doki won Kenobi is crazy.

2598
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,480
It's okay.

2599
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,360
There's no robots coming in.

2600
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:41,740
We're fine.

2601
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,620
We can chill.

2602
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,160
There's no one coming in.

2603
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,760
There's nobody here.

2604
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,140
There's a robot right there.

2605
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:51,760
No, it's not.

2606
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:52,540
Where?

2607
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,780
Just crouch in the corner.

2608
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,700
Be a rat, you know.

2609
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,700
Just rat in the corner.

2610
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,140
Show your superiority.

2611
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:02,800
There's nobody here.

2612
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,260
Thank god they all shot Zeller before they saw him.

2613
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:07,180
Hell yeah!

2614
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,280
I took all the hate.

2615
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,080
I took all the aggro for you.

2616
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,540
Doki, apparently you don't know how to use the map.

2617
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,020
You have to press tab.

2618
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,840
I do, I just follow you guys.

2619
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,900
Okay, we're the map.

2620
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:21,380
Okay, got it.

2621
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:22,820
I'm the map.

2622
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,920
I don't need to look at the map if you guys can look at the map for me.

2623
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,360
Yeah, that's what teammates are for.

2624
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,340
Look at that.

2625
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,240
I'm doing the best.

2626
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,040
You know what?

2627
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,620
I think I've done the best out of all of you guys.

2628
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,980
I have nobody on me.

2629
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,900
It's the safest we've ever been.

2630
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,400
You've got a point.

2631
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,980
Yeah, nobody's here.

2632
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:44,980
Oh...

2633
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:47,700
Oh...

2634
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:48,680
No...

2635
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:51,840
No...

2636
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:52,580
Oh shit!

2637
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:54,980
Oh no...

2638
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,420
Two seconds until...

2639
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:57,780
Yeah!

2640
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,480
Go RPR, go!

2641
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,360
It's like Pokemon!

2642
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,140
I'm gonna land on her.

2643
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,580
Two more minutes until Han Solo, the strongest member, comes back.

2644
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,080
The strongest man in the team comes back.

2645
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,260
We have Doki, one Kenobi.

2646
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,540
We have RPR, 2D2.

2647
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:17,080
Just RPR.

2648
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:19,660
RPR.

2649
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:21,360
RPR2D2.

2650
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:23,260
RPR2D2.

2651
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,040
RPR2D2.

2652
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,420
How the fuck am I R2D2?

2653
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,260
There's dropships, by the way.

2654
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:32,580
There's dropships, by the way.

2655
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,560
Doki, one Kenobi.

2656
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,760
I'm coming back!

2657
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:36,620
I'm coming over!

2658
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,580
That's a lot of robots over there!

2659
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,460
Where do I go?

2660
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,080
R2D2, where do I go?

2661
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:44,980
Kill them!

2662
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,700
Okay, do not call me R2D2.

2663
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,440
Beep, beep, beep!

2664
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,160
Zenlo Binks.

2665
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,380
Who is that?

2666
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,240
I don't even know.

2667
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,920
I've never watched a Star Wars series.

2668
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,480
Oh, Zenlo Binks is like the strongest character in Star Wars.

2669
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,180
He's like a Sith Lord.

2670
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:02,180
Yeah, he's a Sith Lord.

2671
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,080
He's a Sith Lord!

2672
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,900
They're chasing RPR!

2673
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,480
Run!

2674
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,060
Run, Doki!

2675
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:11,780
RPRs!

2676
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,040
Oh, they're coming from behind as well!

2677
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,080
It's okay, I got one.

2678
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,960
You got one only?

2679
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,380
I got one, guys!

2680
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,780
I did my part!

2681
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,320
Zenlo Luribinks.

2682
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:27,820
Zenlo Luribinks.

2683
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:28,600
Okay, I got two.

2684
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:30,180
I'm burning, I'm burning, I'm burning!

2685
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:31,840
How are you burning?

2686
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,400
You have one second!

2687
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,020
30 more seconds!

2688
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,560
30 more seconds before we have the actual carry!

2689
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:41,240
Okay.

2690
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:44,280
You know what?

2691
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,020
I'm gonna leave you then.

2692
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:45,860
You can wait for him.

2693
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,060
I'm gonna go fucking do the rest.

2694
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,160
Wait, what?

2695
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,360
What do you mean?

2696
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,240
You're waiting for the carry, right?

2697
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:51,880
You don't need me.

2698
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,660
You need to get carried too!

2699
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:58,240
I don't carry, so I'm just gonna go do the mission.

2700
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:58,960
Yeah, but you need to get carried.

2701
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,140
You should stay near us so Han Solo can carry us.

2702
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,100
No, no, no, I'm fine.

2703
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,900
You guys got that.

2704
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:06,640
You guys got that.

2705
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,520
Are you reinforcing him?

2706
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,360
No, no, you reinforce him.

2707
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,640
He needs the help.

2708
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:12,820
I got you, Han Solo.

2709
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:14,460
Thank you, thank you.

2710
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,600
Why do these guys explode in flames?

2711
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:16,800
I remember who got you.

2712
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,640
Oh my god!

2713
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:21,920
Oh shit, watch out!

2714
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:24,160
That's fine.

2715
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,840
Okay, let's go.

2716
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:27,880
Let's go back to RPR.

2717
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,020
Let's go back to R2-D2.

2718
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:31,340
No!

2719
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,300
You guys don't need me, right?

2720
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,700
So we reinforced everybody, so everybody's good, right?

2721
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2722
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:39,940
Everybody's good.

2723
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,760
Everybody's good, right?

2724
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,680
I will kill you!

2725
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,140
Dead cat talk.

2726
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2727
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,460
I'm heading over, I'm heading over, I'm trying to run, I have no more stamina!

2728
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,040
I'm heading over, I'm heading over, I'm trying to run, I have no more stamina!

2729
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:00,600
Right here.

2730
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,740
I'm almost there.

2731
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:03,740
Woo!

2732
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:07,280
You're the R2-D2, what the fuck?

2733
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:07,920
You're the R2-D2, what the fuck?

2734
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,740
Doki D2.

2735
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:11,660
Oh god.

2736
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,740
I'm burning, but I'm fine.

2737
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,500
I'm heading over to R2-D2.

2738
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,980
Let's go southwest, southwest.

2739
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,320
Let's go southwest, southwest.

2740
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:24,320
40 seconds and then we'll have another respawn for one of us!

2741
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:24,720
40 seconds and then we'll have another respawn for one of us!

2742
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,960
And I'll be back.

2743
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:30,120
And I will carry you guys once again.

2744
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,960
Hey R2-D2, we're here.

2745
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,940
Yeah, we have problems.

2746
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,760
Wait, I like how you acknowledge that you're R2-D2.

2747
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,460
You responded to that.

2748
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,260
I'm never R2-D2ing again.

2749
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,320
Can the railgun not break these?

2750
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,060
Oh!

2751
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,220
Are you okay?

2752
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,620
The tower, the tower, careful, the tower!

2753
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,180
On the entrance point, yeah.

2754
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,460
Oh shit, oh shit, I'm running away, I'm running away.

2755
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,800
You have an orbital that you can shoot that thing with.

2756
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,300
Okay, yeah, yeah, I do, I do.

2757
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:02,340
I do.

2758
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,260
Give me a sec, I need to remember how to do this.

2759
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:07,020
Uh...

2760
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:07,620
Oh no!

2761
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,960
I missed it from behind!

2762
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,920
I'm going across the map, holy crap.

2763
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:14,640
What happened?

2764
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,780
I got shot by the laser.

2765
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,260
He got tower, no!

2766
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,380
I got tower too!

2767
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,460
RPA, prove to us that you're the carry.

2768
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,140
Come on!

2769
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:25,220
RPA!

2770
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,060
Reinforce me!

2771
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:32,440
Yeah, well you got me if you reinforce me, yo!

2772
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:36,500
You want me to go land on the guy?

2773
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,260
Land on the tower, land on the tower.

2774
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:38,900
Land on the tower, land on the tower.

2775
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,480
Okay, let's see if my aim can...

2776
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,980
Let's see if my aim is good enough to land on the tower, bro.

2777
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:44,920
Don't land on me, please.

2778
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:46,340
Where the fuck?

2779
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:47,380
I can't, bro!

2780
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,000
This is impossible.

2781
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,180
Oh shit.

2782
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:49,980
Okay.

2783
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,180
He's got no aim.

2784
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,220
And no bitches.

2785
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,180
Dude, I was so far away from the...

2786
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:56,000
Alright, what about a grenade for the tower?

2787
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:57,700
No, no, that will not work.

2788
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:58,700
Okay.

2789
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,200
It doesn't work, yeah, I tried.

2790
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:04,180
Holy shit!

2791
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,120
He's shit!

2792
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:06,980
Did he just sound shit?

2793
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:09,560
Oh, I'm burning, I'm burning, I'm burning!

2794
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,220
Heal yourself, heal!

2795
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,220
Heal, heal, heal!

2796
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:15,200
You're doing so well!

2797
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,680
You're doing so well, Seller!

2798
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:17,440
This is my last reload.

2799
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,000
Do you not have resupply?

2800
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,300
Nope, it's over there, look at it.

2801
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,840
I'll get the resupply!

2802
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:24,880
Come to me, come to me!

2803
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:25,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Seller!

2804
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,580
Seller, Seller, Seller, there's a tank behind our PR!

2805
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,160
Do not go behind him!

2806
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:32,860
Okay.

2807
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,040
Where's the extraction point?

2808
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,340
Why aren't you guys going to extraction?

2809
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,000
We don't need these extra...

2810
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:44,500
Guys, what do I do?

2811
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:47,200
Run, run, run, run, Seller, Seller, Seller!

2812
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:47,940
Run and heal!

2813
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,300
Just like how Han did!

2814
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,520
Just run and heal!

2815
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,260
No, there's a tree!

2816
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,780
Don't run towards them!

2817
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,260
Don't run towards them!

2818
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,000
He's gonna die to the tower!

2819
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,140
No, he's not!

2820
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:02,200
Just keep running!

2821
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,160
Run away from them!

2822
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,920
Get away!

2823
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:08,180
Even if we miss this, even if we miss this, there's gonna be an emergency one!

2824
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:09,860
So just stay alive!

2825
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,660
We didn't finish the mission!

2826
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,460
We did!

2827
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:14,500
We just need extraction!

2828
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:15,840
We just need extraction!

2829
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:18,580
20 seconds!

2830
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,400
20 seconds and you get Han Solo back!

2831
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,140
You're gonna run out of bounds!

2832
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:22,600
No!

2833
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:23,940
I hate this game!

2834
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,940
Why am I out of bounds?

2835
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:25,880
That's not out of bounds!

2836
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:28,760
So it's like...

2837
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,700
10 seconds!

2838
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,060
10 seconds!

2839
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,160
Bring me in, coach!

2840
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,500
Don't worry!

2841
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:37,980
The carry's coming back soon!

2842
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:41,040
Get the carry in!

2843
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,160
What the fuck is he...

2844
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:43,820
Bring me in!

2845
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,440
I wanna try!

2846
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:46,140
Give me a second!

2847
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,060
Oh my god...

2848
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,460
Okay, okay.

2849
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:51,640
I gotta go this way.

2850
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:52,440
Give me a second, okay?

2851
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,580
Oh fuck!

2852
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:56,320
Oh fuck!

2853
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:56,760
Oh fuck!

2854
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,180
Oh fuck!

2855
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,180
Oh fuck!

2856
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:58,400
Oh fuck!

2857
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:58,680
Oh fuck!

2858
01:25:58,860 --> 01:25:58,860
Oh fuck!

2859
01:25:58,860 --> 01:25:58,920
Oh fuck!

2860
01:25:58,920 --> 01:25:59,780
Leave me alone!

2861
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:01,180
I did nothing!

2862
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:01,420
Ah!

2863
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,320
I'm coming back in!

2864
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:03,920
I'm coming back in!

2865
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,720
He's coming!

2866
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:05,420
Oh no!

2867
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:07,880
It's me!

2868
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:08,340
Oh no!

2869
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:08,640
It's Han!

2870
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:08,880
It's Han!

2871
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,460
Okay, thank god!

2872
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,480
Oh thank god!

2873
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:11,900
One minute!

2874
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,460
One minute and 50 seconds!

2875
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:14,240
You got this, Han!

2876
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,600
You can do this again!

2877
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,320
Where's the extract?

2878
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,960
I tried my best!

2879
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,740
Bro, that was out of zone!

2880
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,600
I couldn't... I got cornered!

2881
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:29,860
I got cornered!

2882
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,000
You did that to yourself, bro!

2883
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:33,940
No I didn't!

2884
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,840
They didn't tell me which way to go, man!

2885
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,000
We can't see the map when we're dead!

2886
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,820
We can't see the map when we're dead!

2887
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:43,780
Han's still out!

2888
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,440
I don't care!

2889
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,420
I like how... I like how like...

2890
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:52,240
Han comes down and everybody...

2891
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,840
There's no enemies after that.

2892
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,500
He's just chilling.

2893
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,960
One minute left!

2894
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:01,820
Oh shit!

2895
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,180
Wait!

2896
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,560
Wait a minute!

2897
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,160
You have to head there in one minute!

2898
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,040
Wait, isn't this the extraction point?

2899
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:10,100
Wait, you will not be able to...

2900
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,560
You will not be able to...

2901
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:16,380
Res anyone because the reinforce and the ship leaves the stratosphere at the same time.

2902
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,680
So... Oh no!

2903
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,440
It's literally the same time.

2904
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,220
It's a four minute defense!

2905
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:23,960
It's a four minute defense!

2906
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,660
I think we already failed.

2907
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,260
Salutations!

2908
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:27,240
Salutations!

2909
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,500
I think we already failed a mission!

2910
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:33,420
Four minutes of quality content!

2911
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:34,320
Right here!

2912
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:37,620
Okay, I blame RPR for not taking us to extraction.

2913
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,060
You wouldn't do the bonus mission.

2914
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,340
You wouldn't do the bonus mission.

2915
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:42,600
What?

2916
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,140
It's not... It's my fault that you guys kept team killing each other for 15 deaths.

2917
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:46,980
We did!

2918
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,040
We're not team killing each other!

2919
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:52,300
We were not team killing each other!

2920
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:52,660
We were not team killing each other!

2921
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,700
No, imagine that!

2922
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:56,340
The difficulty was just too hard for us.

2923
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:56,640
Okay?

2924
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:00,000
Okay, the copium and the gas lighting.

2925
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,140
Oh no!

2926
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,300
Oh no!

2927
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:05,860
The destroyer has left!

2928
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:06,360
That's good!

2929
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,380
The destroyer has left!

2930
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:09,480
We are the destroyer!

2931
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:11,780
Oh what?

2932
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,500
I thought they were the bad guys.

2933
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:16,340
We're the reinforcements!

2934
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:19,840
That's great!

2935
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:20,360
Well look!

2936
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,400
They can't find him!

2937
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:22,740
Uh oh!

2938
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,300
I wonder if they know where he is.

2939
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,660
They have wall hacks!

2940
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:27,500
This isn't fair!

2941
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,100
It's okay!

2942
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,740
Just keep running!

2943
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,360
Just keep running!

2944
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:37,160
Just keep running for two minutes and 30 seconds!

2945
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:38,860
Just keep running for two minutes and 30 seconds!

2946
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,320
See, this is what happened to me!

2947
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,720
They cornered me like this, man!

2948
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:44,780
Wait, where are you shooting?

2949
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:46,500
Oh no!

2950
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,260
You don't have enough stims for this!

2951
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,780
Wait, how many stims do you have left?

2952
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,400
Two.

2953
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,080
Why do they only give us four stims?

2954
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,540
These guys are stingy, man.

2955
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,160
They should give us like 99 stims.

2956
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:03,440
Can you not see what armor we're wearing?

2957
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,920
I don't know.

2958
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:07,180
I don't know.

2959
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:09,980
Make the stims more compact, I guess.

2960
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:14,180
I believe.

2961
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,640
I believe in him.

2962
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,180
RPR, why don't you believe in him?

2963
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,300
RPR, why don't you believe in him?

2964
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,820
Do I have to say that I believe in him?

2965
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:25,160
Do I have to say that I believe in him?

2966
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:25,340
Yes!

2967
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,180
Of course!

2968
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,140
He knows I believe in him!

2969
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,260
Now he does!

2970
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,980
And now he's dead.

2971
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,220
Maybe he shouldn't have believed in him.

2972
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:37,940
Why did you believe in him?

2973
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:38,800
You jinxed him!

2974
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,200
Oh my god!

2975
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,340
Han Solo...

2976
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:44,960
What the fuck?

2977
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,960
Where did your head go?

2978
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,460
Where did it go?

2979
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,300
He got no head.

2980
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,600
Mission completed.

2981
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:59,560
Han Solo couldn't clutch anymore.

2982
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,120
You couldn't clutch it.

2983
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,580
I blame...

2984
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:07,180
You know what?

2985
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:09,140
I blame R2D2.

2986
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:10,520
Yeah, same.

2987
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:15,700
Yeah, our super citizen wasn't so super.

2988
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:16,140
Yeah.

2989
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:20,300
He looked like a free to play player to me.

2990
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,240
I was like shit!

2991
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:26,220
I was like shit!

2992
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,940
One Zeller died and started screaming.

2993
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,300
I'm getting tea bags!

2994
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,080
You fucking shit!

2995
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:37,920
Zellick!

2996
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:39,360
Zellick!

2997
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:39,880
Zellick!

2998
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,120
I did it!

2999
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:42,880
Bro!

3000
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,440
Look at me.

3001
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:50,700
Only 50 friendly fire damage.

3002
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,180
Bro!

3003
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,680
62k is crazy.

3004
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,000
I don't care!

3005
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:01,120
How did you get to 6000?

3006
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,280
I don't know man.

3007
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:05,900
I don't know.

3008
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:06,680
Oh my god.

3009
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:08,560
But look!

3010
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:09,240
Shots fired.

3011
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,160
1456.

3012
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,140
Yeah and 1400 of them were at us.

3013
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:14,640
Yeah.

3014
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:15,760
No!

3015
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,040
Come on guys.

3016
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,480
What do you mean come on?

3017
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,380
That's not a lie!

3018
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,140
That's just terrible.

3019
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,200
Holy shit.

3020
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,260
That's no fucking lie!

3021
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:30,880
Come on.

3022
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:32,360
12 times.

3023
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,100
12 of our respawns were on him.

3024
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,820
Hey, your fault for killing me.

3025
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,560
If you guys let me live, you know?

3026
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,100
What do you mean our fault?

3027
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:42,080
Who killed you?

3028
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,920
Who was it?

3029
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,400
You guys all killed me.

3030
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:47,500
What do you mean?

3031
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:49,380
Who hurt you?

3032
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:53,060
Alright, let's see.

3033
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:56,260
Oh, I'm gonna have a machine gun sentry.

3034
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,360
Oh my god, I'm gonna buy a gatling sentry.

3035
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,420
I got a vitality enhancement so we can live.

3036
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:03,660
Nice.

3037
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,680
What does that mean?

3038
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,500
Like you don't die as fast.

3039
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:09,600
Oh shit!

3040
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:11,320
So it applies to all of us?

3041
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,160
Yeah.

3042
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,020
So I can shoot Zeller 3 times instead.

3043
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,160
Nice.

3044
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,720
So now you can...

3045
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,040
Oh my god, Zeller can...

3046
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,820
Zeller can break 10k.

3047
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,500
Wait, I want a rifle.

3048
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:27,780
I want a rifle.

3049
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,760
Are rifles strong or are they weak?

3050
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:31,440
Ummm...

3051
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,060
What rifle are you using?

3052
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,460
Shotgun is the best.

3053
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,040
Oh, is it?

3054
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:36,580
Which one is that?

3055
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:38,240
Somebody said RPR Viagra.

3056
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:39,600
Whoa!

3057
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:41,960
Vitality enhancement.

3058
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:43,640
What?

3059
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,540
Dude, someone has the helipad one, right?

3060
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:48,800
Helldiver, the helipad.

3061
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:49,720
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

3062
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:50,280
Yeah, I have the helipad one.

3063
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,000
I have the helipad one.

3064
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:52,840
Where are we going?

3065
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:53,200
Here?

3066
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:56,060
Where do we go?

3067
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:56,860
Here.

3068
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,900
Uh, we'll buy this one.

3069
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,220
Because you have to do this too.

3070
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,080
So we can do the rocket.

3071
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,060
So let's do this one.

3072
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,260
I got sentry!

3073
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:10,620
I'm gonna go with auto-cannon this time.

3074
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:12,440
I think auto-cannon is stronger against automatons.

3075
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,720
I'm gonna bring a shield generator.

3076
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:18,400
I'm gonna bring my turret.

3077
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,280
I'm gonna bring the only two that I have.

3078
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:21,960
What did you have?

3079
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:23,680
He has a shield.

3080
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,580
He has the orbital and the machine gun.

3081
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:26,960
You know you can buy stuff?

3082
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:30,360
I'm pretty sure you have enough money to buy things now.

3083
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,680
I didn't know you could buy stuff.

3084
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,320
Did you put the helipad optimization in?

3085
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,180
Yeah, I did.

3086
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:38,040
Okay, good.

3087
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,320
That one allows you to respawn with full ammo and shit.

3088
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,520
That one allows you to respawn with full ammo and shit.

3089
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,620
I got two mortars.

3090
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,820
One EMS, one actual mortar.

3091
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:48,320
So...

3092
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:49,860
I have...

3093
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,220
I have machine gun.

3094
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:52,720
I have a gatling gun!

3095
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:56,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3096
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,100
I have a sentry now.

3097
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,600
You wanna go to a what?

3098
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,340
I don't have to shoot my gun.

3099
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,160
I can let these guys do it for me.

3100
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:08,200
I can let these guys do it for me.

3101
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:08,820
Alright, machine gun!

3102
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:12,140
Woah, woah, that's so far away.

3103
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:12,620
Holy shit.

3104
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:14,720
Alright, give me a sec.

3105
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:16,280
I'm grabbing my machine gun.

3106
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,260
RPO, you wanna see something funny?

3107
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:19,100
Yeah.

3108
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:19,920
What's the funny thing?

3109
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,100
I'm not gonna do it.

3110
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:25,260
Coward.

3111
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:26,780
I went down, I went down.

3112
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:27,680
Coward, do it!

3113
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,800
Not me, not me, not me, not me.

3114
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,200
I got a machine gun too, guys.

3115
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,160
Do it, but two others.

3116
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:39,940
Oh shit.

3117
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,460
That's a little patrol.

3118
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,060
I shot the guy that called for reinforcements.

3119
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:46,560
So it should be.

3120
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:47,180
Nevermind.

3121
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:47,720
Nice.

3122
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:50,200
The bot drop detected.

3123
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:51,700
You did it, RPR.

3124
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,300
Is that what you were trying to do?

3125
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,180
There was two of them, okay?

3126
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,280
At least I shot one of them.

3127
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:54,880
Did you shoot one?

3128
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:55,360
No, you didn't.

3129
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:57,860
Yes, but you're a super citizen.

3130
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,940
You should have been able to shoot both.

3131
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,580
I'm not super citizen right now.

3132
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,020
So that tags a lie?

3133
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:06,880
So you gave up your citizenship?

3134
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:08,680
Oh, you're a traitor.

3135
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:11,980
Oh my god, you're not here for democracy and liberty?

3136
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:16,340
I'm just gonna not talk to you guys.

3137
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,580
I'm just gonna focus on shooting.

3138
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:19,520
Guys, shoot the back!

3139
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,000
Wait, wait, wait.

3140
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,080
What do you mean?

3141
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:24,940
There's nobody in the back.

3142
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,720
Oh, this guy.

3143
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,040
I'm reloading.

3144
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:31,100
I'm reloading.

3145
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:32,980
Are you okay, Han?

3146
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,040
I'm good.

3147
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:34,320
I'm good.

3148
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,760
I knew he was fine.

3149
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,300
I have the power of friendship.

3150
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,200
Yay!

3151
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:44,440
Why can't you have the power of friendship?

3152
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,280
Wait, wait, wait.

3153
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:45,560
This side.

3154
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,240
350, 350, 350.

3155
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:50,520
Don't worry.

3156
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,860
I'm shooting my gun.

3157
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:54,720
We're good.

3158
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:54,980
We're good.

3159
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:56,660
Everything's good.

3160
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,460
There's some bullshit by us.

3161
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:01,980
I gotta reload!

3162
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,340
Where do we go?

3163
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,480
Here, on me.

3164
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:09,380
See, this is why I don't need to look at my map.

3165
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,460
I can just follow you.

3166
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:12,820
She's screaming something.

3167
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:15,600
We're super!

3168
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:17,600
Yeah!

3169
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,020
I need more bullets.

3170
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:21,060
I need more bullets.

3171
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:23,980
Here, here.

3172
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:24,360
It's right here.

3173
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:26,640
Right here, right where?

3174
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,800
Right here, right here.

3175
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,560
Right here, right now.

3176
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:34,700
Oh, is that bullet?

3177
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:37,180
Bro, he slapped me.

3178
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:39,520
No, I didn't.

3179
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:39,940
I missed.

3180
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:40,980
Bro, he hit me.

3181
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:43,100
What?

3182
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,400
Oh, my God.

3183
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:47,480
Oh, my God.

3184
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,820
I'm gonna cancel you right now.

3185
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:49,440
Yeah.

3186
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:52,340
Oh, shit.

3187
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:53,040
Make it X longer.

3188
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,040
Oh, I'm dead.

3189
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:58,660
Flames are on the same floor.

3190
01:36:58,740 --> 01:36:59,940
I just got one shot by that.

3191
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:02,160
Oh, we need a save.

3192
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:04,880
Oh, you have...

3193
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:06,800
Someone res.

3194
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:08,720
Well, I'm taking him on a walk.

3195
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,360
I got you.

3196
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,140
I got you.

3197
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:13,720
Uh...

3198
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,540
I'm taking Mr. Flamethrower on a walk.

3199
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:19,780
I'm taking Mr. Flamethrower on a walk.

3200
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:20,500
Oh, it's a Hulk.

3201
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,620
Oh, no!

3202
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:23,420
I'm shooting his back.

3203
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:26,500
I killed him.

3204
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:26,820
I killed him.

3205
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:27,660
I took him on a walk.

3206
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:31,120
Dude, I clutched up there, baby.

3207
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,340
See, I told you.

3208
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:37,120
Yeah, I just watched Ducky literally sit in front of me and tank the flamethrower.

3209
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,320
Yeah, I just watched Ducky literally sit in front of me and tank the flamethrower.

3210
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,500
I take that for you.

3211
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:43,520
I did that for you.

3212
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:44,500
I aggroed it.

3213
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:46,560
Activate the transformer.

3214
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:49,500
Where do we go?

3215
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,540
Gotta activate this transformer.

3216
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:53,380
There's a reloaded machine gun here.

3217
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:55,180
I'll just do everything, guys.

3218
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:55,880
Yay!

3219
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,440
He did it.

3220
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,260
He did everything.

3221
01:37:59,080 --> 01:37:59,620
Let's go!

3222
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,360
Alright, next up.

3223
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,360
Alright, sweet.

3224
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,440
Great teamwork, baby.

3225
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,140
Let's go.

3226
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,400
We're a good team, RPO.

3227
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,620
Yeah, great teamwork.

3228
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:15,120
Dude, I was fucking that flamethrower guy from the back.

3229
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:16,380
Holy shit, man.

3230
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,920
We're so good at this game.

3231
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:19,740
Grenading.

3232
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,380
Can I not auto-canon this thing?

3233
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,280
I thought I could.

3234
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:24,980
I got you.

3235
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:25,960
Can I get up here?

3236
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:29,000
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

3237
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,480
I'm turning around.

3238
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,760
Someone said this might be my favorite group of idiots.

3239
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:36,820
Look to the left!

3240
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:37,380
Holy shit!

3241
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:39,920
Oh, I did it!

3242
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:43,420
There's a fucking horde of them coming over here.

3243
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:43,980
Wait, where?

3244
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:46,940
Grenade!

3245
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:48,020
Grenade!

3246
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,360
That's a scout!

3247
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,960
That was a huge nade.

3248
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:52,660
Okay.

3249
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:56,680
I practiced so much by blowing you guys up.

3250
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,040
I'm so used to these grenades now.

3251
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:58,700
Leave it to me, yo.

3252
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:02,200
You just detected a huge horde to us.

3253
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,160
Dude, you practiced by blowing?

3254
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,080
Do you also swallow?

3255
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,380
No, I don't swallow.

3256
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:09,820
No, I will never.

3257
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,800
Holy shit, guys!

3258
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:13,920
Wait, wait, there's a big guy!

3259
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:15,700
I'm slipping!

3260
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,620
I might die.

3261
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,180
Zeller, we left you.

3262
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,280
You guys are horrible!

3263
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:22,180
You killed me!

3264
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,340
Who killed you?

3265
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:28,820
After all I've done.

3266
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,460
After all I did to you.

3267
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:31,140
No!

3268
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:35,220
Oh, you suck so much dick.

3269
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:39,480
Spawn us in.

3270
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:41,040
You guys killed me!

3271
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:42,500
I'm back.

3272
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,600
Bro, leave it to me, yo.

3273
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:51,400
Oh, we got spotted by the flamethrower!

3274
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:52,280
No!

3275
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:54,360
I'm fucking in the back!

3276
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,120
I'm fucking in the back!

3277
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:55,440
Nice!

3278
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:57,000
We did it, we did it!

3279
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,060
He fucked him in the back.

3280
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:00,760
Oh, shit!

3281
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:03,880
How was it?

3282
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:06,360
Not even close.

3283
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,460
Not even close, baby!

3284
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:10,540
Next stop is this big red area right here.

3285
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:10,780
Let's go.

3286
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,120
Alright, nice.

3287
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:13,380
Alright, where is that?

3288
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,180
Follow me.

3289
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:20,020
Alright, guys, I need machine gun ammo, if anybody has extra ammo.

3290
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,920
Let me get you with a resupply.

3291
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:22,760
Nice!

3292
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:28,600
Oh my god, our peer discovered heavy outposts and he also died.

3293
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:34,450
Let's play resupply chicken.

3294
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:38,930
Resupply chicken, let's go.

3295
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:39,450
Oh!

3296
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:41,310
No!

3297
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,370
You're a bigger chicken than I am!

3298
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:46,370
That's three hawks, that's three hawks.

3299
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:47,210
I nuclear bombed it.

3300
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:48,750
That's four hawks, that's four hawks.

3301
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:51,970
Oh wait, there's even more, there's even more, there's even more!

3302
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,570
We're coming over, we're coming over!

3303
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:58,470
I exploded a bunch of them, but they didn't die to a nuclear fucking bomb.

3304
01:40:58,650 --> 01:40:58,930
Hello?

3305
01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:00,210
It's okay, I'm gonna flank around.

3306
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:01,830
Guys, it's okay, I'm...

3307
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:03,970
Oh no, they're all focused on me.

3308
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:05,610
Oh no, they're all focused on me.

3309
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:09,490
Oh god, oh god, oh god, okay, it's okay, I'm machine gunning.

3310
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:11,250
I got a nuclear bomb as well.

3311
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:13,690
Nuclear orbit, I dropped it.

3312
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:15,110
How did you have a bomb?

3313
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:17,470
An orbit, an orbit, I threw it, I threw it.

3314
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:18,890
I don't have anything to do with it though.

3315
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:20,630
Oh my god, I got rocketed in my ass.

3316
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:21,730
Oh shit!

3317
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:23,330
Oh god.

3318
01:41:23,630 --> 01:41:26,650
It's okay, I have a, I have a Eagle cluster.

3319
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:28,270
I'm throwing it.

3320
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:29,530
I think I did something, I think I did something.

3321
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:31,710
I killed the cannon, I killed the cannon here.

3322
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:33,750
Eagle cluster on my ass?

3323
01:41:36,410 --> 01:41:37,330
What do you mean it's helpful?

3324
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:39,130
It's coming down!

3325
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:40,070
What do you mean it's helpful?

3326
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:43,050
You killed me!

3327
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:44,070
You killed me!

3328
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:46,030
Tom and Zillr got eagle clustered by Doki.

3329
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:47,950
That was some sick moves.

3330
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:51,010
I said, I called out my eagle cluster.

3331
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:53,090
I killed the flamethrower guy though.

3332
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:53,650
I killed the flamethrower guy though.

3333
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:53,650
I killed one.

3334
01:41:53,970 --> 01:41:56,910
At that point you might as well just be like, I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill you.

3335
01:41:56,990 --> 01:41:57,010
I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill you.

3336
01:41:57,130 --> 01:42:00,390
Yeah, but you guys still didn't know it was happening.

3337
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:03,830
Oh no, I landed right in front of the mess of flames!

3338
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:04,290
I'm gonna throw...

3339
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,190
It's okay, I'm fucking killing him.

3340
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:08,170
We're good, he's dead.

3341
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:10,630
There's two more though.

3342
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:13,770
Okay guys, I'm gonna put an orb on our strike this time.

3343
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:17,170
There's two more of these motherfuckers.

3344
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:19,450
Wait, I have the gallon gun!

3345
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:22,210
Use it then, will you?

3346
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:23,150
I use it!

3347
01:42:24,490 --> 01:42:26,330
We both said the same thing.

3348
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:29,290
It's coming down!

3349
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:31,590
I'm helping!

3350
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:32,310
You throw me one!

3351
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:33,770
Yeah, that was very helpful.

3352
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:37,510
Just give the enemy the fucking weapon as well next time.

3353
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:39,490
No, it's my gallon gun!

3354
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:40,290
Turret!

3355
01:42:40,910 --> 01:42:41,710
I got you!

3356
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:42,630
It's a turret!

3357
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:44,850
It's helping!

3358
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:49,310
Oh my god, I'm so helpful.

3359
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:51,170
Yes it is, look at him, he's shooting the thing.

3360
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:52,730
Look at him shoot!

3361
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:55,150
Look at him go!

3362
01:42:55,490 --> 01:42:57,650
Oh my god, oh my god!

3363
01:42:58,490 --> 01:42:59,970
Oh my god!

3364
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:02,330
There's so many things!

3365
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:04,130
There's one more Hulk.

3366
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:04,810
It's okay.

3367
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:08,110
We're fine.

3368
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:10,450
Not today, bitches!

3369
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:12,670
Nice, nice, let's go!

3370
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:13,370
We did it!

3371
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:15,250
We're doing it!

3372
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:17,570
We killed all the Hulks, now we kill the small trash now.

3373
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:19,950
And then we'll resupply, because holy fuck.

3374
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:20,610
We did it!

3375
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:23,990
We're doing our part.

3376
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:24,650
This motherfucker fly!

3377
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:26,950
I'm gonna do an orbital over there.

3378
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:27,610
There's another one!

3379
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:30,010
Wait, I have enough for ego strike!

3380
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:31,750
Yeah, orbital!

3381
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:34,630
I'm throwing it, I'm throwing it!

3382
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:35,010
Eagle strike!

3383
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:37,110
I'm running too!

3384
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:38,690
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna run!

3385
01:43:38,730 --> 01:43:40,290
I'm gonna kill you right now!

3386
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:43,070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3387
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:44,710
I'm going to kill you right now!

3388
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:46,850
I'm going to kill you right now!

3389
01:43:48,030 --> 01:43:49,050
I'm so proud of you!

3390
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:51,390
One more, one more and you still didn't die!

3391
01:43:51,570 --> 01:43:53,290
That was not mine!

3392
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:55,990
I'll shoot the back!

3393
01:43:56,110 --> 01:43:56,410
I'll shoot the back!

3394
01:43:57,730 --> 01:43:59,370
Okay, I'll sit here and look pretty then.

3395
01:44:00,990 --> 01:44:02,170
I am heading over.

3396
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:02,850
What the fuck is this?

3397
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,030
He's throwing me around!

3398
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,250
I'm grenade?

3399
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:06,270
I'm nading?

3400
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:07,050
Oh no, he's looking at me now!

3401
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:08,030
Nice!

3402
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:10,230
Nice, nice, nice!

3403
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:11,030
Nice grenade!

3404
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:16,150
Guys, we're getting naded from the west.

3405
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:17,290
Oh shit, okay.

3406
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:18,970
I'm in the stars, sorry.

3407
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:21,270
Okay.

3408
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:23,630
Holy fuck, this is bad.

3409
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:24,890
RPR, where do we go?

3410
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:28,270
Wait, I'm dealing with the rest of this trash here.

3411
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:29,510
We can help!

3412
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:32,350
Yeah, shoot his right leg without the cannon.

3413
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:33,990
That's okay, I threw a nade.

3414
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:36,310
Right leg without a cannon, huh?

3415
01:44:37,090 --> 01:44:37,490
Nice.

3416
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:39,310
We did it!

3417
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:41,390
There's still one more.

3418
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:44,550
Yeah, he's like all the way up in front of us.

3419
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:47,010
Got you, I'm flanking him.

3420
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:48,790
Don't worry, I'm flanking him with you.

3421
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:52,130
He won't expect two flankers.

3422
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:54,970
I am in range of the enemy artillery.

3423
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:57,190
There is a guy right in front of you.

3424
01:44:57,370 --> 01:44:58,190
I got him.

3425
01:44:58,950 --> 01:44:59,850
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3426
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:01,190
Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go.

3427
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:01,590
Yeah!

3428
01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:02,750
We did it!

3429
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:05,130
We did it.

3430
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:06,810
More ammo, more ammo on me, ammo on me.

3431
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:08,210
More ammo on you?

3432
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:08,730
Where, where, where?

3433
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:09,750
I'm over here, I'm over here.

3434
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:10,270
Nice.

3435
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:12,150
I have no more ammo.

3436
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:16,350
Alright guys, next up we gotta go...

3437
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:17,230
here.

3438
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:19,530
Where's here?

3439
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:20,350
Where's here?

3440
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:22,990
Just fucking follow me, man.

3441
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:24,390
You gotta babysit us.

3442
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:26,710
Just fucking follow me.

3443
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:27,690
Okay, okay, okay.

3444
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:28,830
We're here, we're here, we're here.

3445
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,330
Throwing resupply, resupply.

3446
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:33,690
Oh my god, that's for us.

3447
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:35,350
For us?

3448
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:36,790
For us?

3449
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:39,330
Did you fucking shoot me?

3450
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:41,810
No, we're shooting people behind us.

3451
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:43,670
No, why would we ever shoot you?

3452
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:44,110
Yeah, why would we?

3453
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:44,490
We're a team.

3454
01:45:45,870 --> 01:45:47,650
You guys don't do that ever.

3455
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:48,930
Yeah, we don't.

3456
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:49,250
Wow.

3457
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:52,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the fucking bombs.

3458
01:45:52,890 --> 01:45:53,910
They're flying over here.

3459
01:45:53,910 --> 01:45:54,590
Where?

3460
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:56,030
Mortar strike.

3461
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:57,090
Coming in.

3462
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:57,490
Careful.

3463
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,410
This resupply is bugged.

3464
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:02,710
No, I got one.

3465
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:02,930
No!

3466
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:04,930
I cannot get one.

3467
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:07,030
There's people behind us.

3468
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:08,150
I'm needing, I'm needing, I'm needing.

3469
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:09,970
They're dead, they're dead, they're dead.

3470
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:11,670
What is this?

3471
01:46:11,670 --> 01:46:12,710
What is this resupply?

3472
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:14,630
I don't know, you're the one that put it down there.

3473
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:16,630
Dude, the bombs are nutty.

3474
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:18,890
Yo, this is on you.

3475
01:46:18,990 --> 01:46:20,770
This is actually on you.

3476
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:22,510
Oh, that's fine.

3477
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:25,170
Yeah, why didn't we do that?

3478
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:27,350
We gotta go, we gotta go.

3479
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:28,970
Go, go, go, go.

3480
01:46:29,230 --> 01:46:30,470
Are we gonna arouse this guy?

3481
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:33,370
Oh wait, he said, when did he die?

3482
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:35,310
The bomb hit him.

3483
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:36,630
When did he die?

3484
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:39,990
Okay.

3485
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:44,170
Nice.

3486
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:48,170
Oh, we need, we need resupply.

3487
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:49,170
I have another day.

3488
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:50,410
Wait, how did you die?

3489
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:50,830
Oh no.

3490
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:53,810
I got, I got, I got two shield boys on me.

3491
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:54,510
Two shield boys.

3492
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:56,250
Wait, how are we gonna get to the boys?

3493
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:57,850
Just res me, just res me.

3494
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:59,030
I res you, I res you.

3495
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:00,750
Where's the shield boys?

3496
01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:03,670
Right next to the spawner.

3497
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:04,830
Gotcha.

3498
01:47:04,990 --> 01:47:06,310
I just died.

3499
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:09,910
As soon as you landed?

3500
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:13,130
Inside my health pod.

3501
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:15,590
I'm so proud of you sacrificing one for the team.

3502
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:18,810
Thank you for your, thank you for your sacrifice, RPR.

3503
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:20,610
You really had it.

3504
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:21,730
Yay freedom!

3505
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:23,570
Freedom!

3506
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:24,890
I'm so proud of you.

3507
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:26,310
You did it!

3508
01:47:26,330 --> 01:47:27,250
The real citizen.

3509
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:32,870
We did it!

3510
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:35,070
How does that even?

3511
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:36,250
Oh, there's more.

3512
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:38,170
Oh, he's shooting at us right now.

3513
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:40,950
Careful, careful, careful.

3514
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:41,570
Careful.

3515
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:42,870
That's wild.

3516
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:45,590
That's an artillery shooting at us.

3517
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:46,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3518
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:48,550
I'm trying to get away from that right now.

3519
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:50,970
I'm back.

3520
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:52,690
Where's the artillery?

3521
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:55,190
I guess you guys don't wanna...

3522
01:47:55,190 --> 01:47:56,210
It's right here.

3523
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:58,610
We should extract, guys.

3524
01:47:58,810 --> 01:47:59,810
We should extract.

3525
01:47:59,950 --> 01:48:02,890
We could get rid of all of this red stuff on the map.

3526
01:48:03,490 --> 01:48:04,510
We have nine lives.

3527
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:05,650
Yo, fuck this cannon.

3528
01:48:05,830 --> 01:48:07,330
We have nine lives, we can do this.

3529
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:09,590
Look on the right, look on the right.

3530
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:11,190
Go kill that fucking spawner on the right.

3531
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:13,510
Okay, okay, us three on the right.

3532
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:15,830
Where are you gonna go, RPR?

3533
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:16,810
Where are you gonna go?

3534
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:20,810
I'm gonna go to the left.

3535
01:48:20,810 --> 01:48:20,970
Oh, god.

3536
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:23,590
Wait, wait, I have enough for Eagle Cluster.

3537
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:27,270
Eagle Cluster, Eagle Cluster, Eagle Cluster.

3538
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:28,070
Oh, no.

3539
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:29,350
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

3540
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:30,690
No, no, no, no.

3541
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:34,050
Okay, don't worry, I got you.

3542
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:35,910
I won't throw you into the Eagle Cluster.

3543
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:38,010
You could, I wouldn't really.

3544
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:40,330
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3545
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:45,110
It's okay, it's God.

3546
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:48,450
It's okay, it's God.

3547
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:48,570
Did we?

3548
01:48:48,710 --> 01:48:49,310
Yeah, we did.

3549
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:50,210
Yep.

3550
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:50,890
Nice.

3551
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:53,310
Nice, Eagle Cluster.

3552
01:48:53,570 --> 01:48:58,030
Don't take my E, just yoink it right in front of me, you evil, evil man, you evil, evil man.

3553
01:48:58,210 --> 01:48:58,530
Ah!

3554
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:00,190
Doki, no!

3555
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:03,170
What the fuck?

3556
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:05,790
I'm totally not in this thing.

3557
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:06,930
Okay, okay.

3558
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:11,610
How do I, how do I drop this, how do I drop this, bro?

3559
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:13,250
I forget.

3560
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:15,830
Oh, there we go, here you go, you got it, here you go.

3561
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:17,350
I picked up Doki's wish- AHH!

3562
01:49:19,570 --> 01:49:20,510
Democracy has led!

3563
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:33,210
There's so many people!

3564
01:49:35,050 --> 01:49:36,150
I'm back, bitches!

3565
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:38,090
Come back!

3566
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:40,210
Come back!

3567
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:43,930
How are you guys dying all the time?

3568
01:49:43,970 --> 01:49:44,570
What's going on?

3569
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:47,030
You left us alone!

3570
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:48,950
I'm here!

3571
01:49:50,730 --> 01:49:52,390
You left us alone!

3572
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:54,510
Now look what's going on!

3573
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:56,310
Bring me back!

3574
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:59,310
I mean, you can show how fucking hard I can handle you guys.

3575
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:00,690
Bring me back!

3576
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:00,810
Right?

3577
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:03,750
We can't take care of ourselves.

3578
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:05,710
Right, hun?

3579
01:50:05,710 --> 01:50:05,710
Hun?

3580
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:06,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3581
01:50:07,610 --> 01:50:08,830
Yeah, you got that, right?

3582
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:09,890
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

3583
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:12,510
Hun, where am I?

3584
01:50:14,270 --> 01:50:14,750
Yeah!

3585
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:17,310
Jesus Christ!

3586
01:50:17,670 --> 01:50:18,230
Come back!

3587
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:20,370
Come back, you serial killer!

3588
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,130
Bring me back!

3589
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:23,850
Welcome back.

3590
01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:26,810
Bring me back!

3591
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:29,670
I'm back, I'm back guys.

3592
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:31,170
There's a scary dude near our PR.

3593
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:32,510
It's like nothing happened.

3594
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:36,050
Oh, a Hulk!

3595
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:38,070
Alright, where do we go?

3596
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:40,090
Yo, yo, how do I use this?

3597
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:40,970
Keep running in circles, keep running in circles!

3598
01:50:41,290 --> 01:50:42,150
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

3599
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:43,390
It's okay!

3600
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:44,190
Nade!

3601
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:45,210
I got it!

3602
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:45,210
Nice!

3603
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:46,230
We did it!

3604
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:48,810
Where's the strategy?

3605
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:51,310
We gotta go get these sentry guns.

3606
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:53,450
Fuck, these things are... OH MY GOD!

3607
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:54,590
OH MY GOD!

3608
01:50:54,870 --> 01:50:56,890
Guys, we gotta get that turret.

3609
01:50:57,130 --> 01:50:59,250
We gotta get that turret, guys.

3610
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:01,230
How do we get that turret?

3611
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:01,790
I'm trying.

3612
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:03,170
I can go for a solo mission, I got you.

3613
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:05,270
Point me towards the...

3614
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:06,030
What?!

3615
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:08,970
Point me towards it.

3616
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:11,650
It turns over there!

3617
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:12,730
It's...

3618
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:12,970
OH!

3619
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:15,270
Please, please, please!

3620
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:17,490
I think I got the turret with this one.

3621
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:18,430
Not again, not again, not again!

3622
01:51:20,210 --> 01:51:21,530
I'm going with you, our PR.

3623
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:22,210
We got this.

3624
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:22,750
I'm so scared.

3625
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:25,690
I'm just gonna hide behind... did you get it?

3626
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:26,370
Did you get the turret?

3627
01:51:27,570 --> 01:51:30,010
Nice, one turret's dead, one turret's dead, one turret's dead over here.

3628
01:51:30,370 --> 01:51:31,490
Okay, okay, I can ego strike.

3629
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:32,590
I can ego strike.

3630
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:37,130
If all else fails, I have ego clustering.

3631
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:39,510
Oh shit, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck!

3632
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:40,430
Eagle cluster!

3633
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:42,190
Nice.

3634
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:44,850
Oh, there's an AT&T behind us.

3635
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:47,750
I'm gonna orbital strike this.

3636
01:51:50,330 --> 01:51:51,430
I'm gonna orbital strike this.

3637
01:51:52,110 --> 01:51:52,590
Orbital strike.

3638
01:51:52,590 --> 01:51:53,710
What the hell was that?

3639
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:56,050
Yeah, yeah, I almost strike my ass, I'm dead.

3640
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:58,850
Wow, my strike hasn't even hit yet.

3641
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:00,970
Well, it wouldn't kill me then.

3642
01:52:01,110 --> 01:52:04,430
I don't know that it hasn't even hit yet, that wasn't mine!

3643
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:05,130
I don't know that it hasn't even hit yet, that wasn't mine!

3644
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:06,130
Okay.

3645
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:07,670
Where's the other turret?

3646
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:09,450
Oh, I don't know.

3647
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:12,430
I don't think there is a turret, it's an artillery thing.

3648
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:14,690
How do we get rid of the artillery?

3649
01:52:15,170 --> 01:52:17,810
We gotta find it, and then just pull it.

3650
01:52:17,970 --> 01:52:18,970
Oh, we could just leave.

3651
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:20,110
Wait.

3652
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:22,870
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

3653
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:24,970
You know, what's the fun in that?

3654
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:27,730
We have three more rebats.

3655
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:28,150
I mean, it's dying, it's dying!

3656
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:30,630
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3657
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:32,210
No!

3658
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:33,410
No!

3659
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:34,910
The fucking turret!

3660
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:38,970
Why?

3661
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:39,390
Why?

3662
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:41,150
Hey guys!

3663
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:44,170
I am right here!

3664
01:52:45,890 --> 01:52:47,010
Wait, I can like, can I...

3665
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:49,430
If I land on the robot, does it do damage?

3666
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:50,810
Yeah, it kills it, it kills it.

3667
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:52,450
I'll mark it, oh, it's dead, it's dead.

3668
01:52:52,690 --> 01:52:53,090
Boom!

3669
01:52:54,330 --> 01:52:55,350
You're welcome, guys.

3670
01:52:56,230 --> 01:52:57,130
Hey, welcome on in.

3671
01:52:57,230 --> 01:52:58,670
Oh, four damage by me, chaps!

3672
01:52:59,090 --> 01:52:59,490
Wow!

3673
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:04,210
Guys, we have two reinforcements left, guys.

3674
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:05,810
Okay, let's go to the objective.

3675
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:06,530
Let's go here.

3676
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,170
Alright, alright, alright, I'm following you, hun.

3677
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,810
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

3678
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:12,250
I see the artillery.

3679
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:13,430
I'll get rid of the artillery.

3680
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:15,490
Yay, I believe in your RPR.

3681
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:16,850
You can do this for us.

3682
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:18,430
Oh, it's not that way?

3683
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:18,690
Okay.

3684
01:53:18,970 --> 01:53:21,210
I believe less in you now.

3685
01:53:21,930 --> 01:53:22,550
I gotta go around.

3686
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:23,570
They still kind of believe in me, right?

3687
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:28,210
Oh, I thought you were getting rid of the artillery.

3688
01:53:28,390 --> 01:53:28,950
What is this?

3689
01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:30,150
What is this?

3690
01:53:31,090 --> 01:53:33,570
There's so many guys, it sounds like Cossacks in this game.

3691
01:53:33,610 --> 01:53:34,250
Holy shit.

3692
01:53:34,330 --> 01:53:34,610
Holy shit.

3693
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:38,170
Okay.

3694
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:39,510
Okay, um...

3695
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:40,950
AHH!

3696
01:53:43,450 --> 01:53:43,850
Um...

3697
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:45,870
Who the fuck are you?

3698
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:50,310
So, are you reinforcing me?

3699
01:53:50,350 --> 01:53:51,390
Are you reinforcing him?

3700
01:53:53,130 --> 01:53:54,610
Let me do it.

3701
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:57,290
Yeah, there's a lot of people on me right now.

3702
01:53:57,690 --> 01:53:58,470
Okay, I got you.

3703
01:53:58,810 --> 01:53:59,770
Okay, okay, okay.

3704
01:54:01,330 --> 01:54:03,030
I have a bunch of them on me.

3705
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:05,290
This is okay.

3706
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:06,510
I'm heading over to you.

3707
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:07,550
Nice, nice, nice.

3708
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:09,090
Cover up and appreciate if you need to.

3709
01:54:09,390 --> 01:54:09,990
It's okay, it's okay.

3710
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:12,670
I made them run around in a circle, so we're fine.

3711
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:13,750
I got the nade.

3712
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:14,230
I got the nade.

3713
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:14,810
Nade down.

3714
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:16,930
I got one only.

3715
01:54:17,310 --> 01:54:18,070
Okay, I'm heading back.

3716
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:19,450
I'm nading, I'm nading, I'm nading.

3717
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:20,030
Careful, careful.

3718
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:21,250
We run back.

3719
01:54:22,570 --> 01:54:23,250
Nice, nice, nice.

3720
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:25,590
We're doing it.

3721
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:27,250
Behind us, behind us.

3722
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:28,130
North, north, north.

3723
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:29,350
There's an auto-cannon.

3724
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:30,850
Oh my god, I almost fucking...

3725
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:32,670
Let's go northeast, okay?

3726
01:54:32,710 --> 01:54:32,990
Northeast.

3727
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:33,530
Okay.

3728
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:39,870
Oh, no.

3729
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:42,050
Oh, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

3730
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:42,430
I'm okay.

3731
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:44,330
We have last reinforce.

3732
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:46,590
Hun, you got that, Hun?

3733
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:47,810
Yep.

3734
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:49,650
I'm gonna throw a nade behind us.

3735
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:52,090
Yo, up here is just chillin', bro.

3736
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:54,450
Bro, we have all of the botas.

3737
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:57,730
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3738
01:54:57,730 --> 01:54:59,470
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3739
01:54:59,710 --> 01:55:00,510
Seller, run.

3740
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:01,630
Seller, run.

3741
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:01,990
Follow me.

3742
01:55:02,010 --> 01:55:03,710
Yes, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

3743
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:04,250
Just run.

3744
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:08,770
Don't aggro anybody that you don't need to.

3745
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:10,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3746
01:55:11,050 --> 01:55:12,050
Just keep running.

3747
01:55:13,470 --> 01:55:14,770
Oh my god, we did it!

3748
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:16,130
We got the artillery!

3749
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:18,150
Good job, guys.

3750
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:20,190
We did it, guys!

3751
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:21,410
We did it, okay?

3752
01:55:21,410 --> 01:55:22,450
Yeah, we're a team.

3753
01:55:24,070 --> 01:55:25,170
We're a team.

3754
01:55:25,390 --> 01:55:27,390
We aggroed the rest of the bot.

3755
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:30,650
We were the distractions.

3756
01:55:30,910 --> 01:55:31,670
Yeah, we're the distractions.

3757
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:34,310
Yeah, we did our job.

3758
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:36,390
Yeah, no, you guys did great.

3759
01:55:36,390 --> 01:55:37,110
Good job, guys.

3760
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:40,630
Run this way so you don't aggro those big guys.

3761
01:55:40,950 --> 01:55:42,190
Alright, alright, alright.

3762
01:55:42,550 --> 01:55:44,350
Oh, I got shot in the foot.

3763
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:44,770
It's okay.

3764
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:45,690
They didn't see us.

3765
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:46,270
They don't see us.

3766
01:55:46,330 --> 01:55:47,410
We don't have any of the aggro.

3767
01:55:48,670 --> 01:55:49,850
Oh, oh, oh.

3768
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:51,670
We going in.

3769
01:55:51,850 --> 01:55:53,290
Or we going sneaky-beaky like?

3770
01:55:54,650 --> 01:55:56,890
Where is... Oh my gosh, the extraction is so far.

3771
01:55:59,150 --> 01:55:59,990
It's okay, it's okay.

3772
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:02,910
We're gathering more reinforcements anyway.

3773
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:04,990
Oh no, they saw us.

3774
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:07,450
On?

3775
01:56:08,150 --> 01:56:08,550
On?

3776
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:09,710
What did you do?

3777
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:12,150
What did you do, Han?

3778
01:56:12,650 --> 01:56:13,490
We did it!

3779
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:15,910
Yeah, you guys did this as well.

3780
01:56:15,950 --> 01:56:16,310
It was crazy.

3781
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:20,810
You guys keep doing it.

3782
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:21,250
It's crazy.

3783
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:22,770
We're doing it.

3784
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:24,610
I'm actually dead to fire.

3785
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:27,390
I'm not actually.

3786
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:28,250
I'm alive somehow.

3787
01:56:28,470 --> 01:56:28,790
I lived.

3788
01:56:29,030 --> 01:56:31,270
Wait, you don't have any stims?

3789
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:34,990
I'm calling a resupply just to get stims.

3790
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:35,910
Because I don't.

3791
01:56:36,650 --> 01:56:37,250
We're all good.

3792
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:38,210
We resupply by dying.

3793
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:39,330
Yeah, exactly.

3794
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:40,450
Good job guys.

3795
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:43,110
You can count on us.

3796
01:56:43,130 --> 01:56:44,630
We never need a resupply.

3797
01:56:44,650 --> 01:56:46,050
We just keep coming back.

3798
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:47,810
Exactly.

3799
01:56:48,970 --> 01:56:49,930
Legends never die.

3800
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:51,470
Here we go.

3801
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:51,970
Where do we go?

3802
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:53,510
Is it...

3803
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:56,170
Oh, is this the...

3804
01:56:56,170 --> 01:56:57,330
Is this the...

3805
01:56:58,210 --> 01:56:59,050
Is this extra?

3806
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:01,730
Oh, do you just take us to extra instead of extraction?

3807
01:57:02,930 --> 01:57:03,990
No, this is what we have to do.

3808
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:05,370
We have to launch the missile.

3809
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:07,730
Can you guys unlock that down there?

3810
01:57:07,870 --> 01:57:09,150
Okay, yeah, I can do that.

3811
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,070
Ow, I took fall damage.

3812
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:13,010
Oh, shit.

3813
01:57:13,070 --> 01:57:14,230
Save my fucking kneecaps.

3814
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:16,290
I got this.

3815
01:57:16,390 --> 01:57:17,430
I'll go from left.

3816
01:57:17,470 --> 01:57:18,190
You go from right.

3817
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:19,010
Okay.

3818
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:21,310
Alright, nice.

3819
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:22,350
We got two.

3820
01:57:24,650 --> 01:57:25,090
Okay.

3821
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:27,630
Okay, now we're just gonna...

3822
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:28,990
We're gonna have to stand in the middle of it.

3823
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:31,670
We have one reinforcement.

3824
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:33,230
Don't be a coward.

3825
01:57:33,490 --> 01:57:34,230
Watch this.

3826
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:36,470
Okay, actually, no.

3827
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:39,210
There's actually fucking guys next to us.

3828
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:40,590
Wait a minute.

3829
01:57:41,010 --> 01:57:42,450
Oh, they're jumping on me.

3830
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:43,550
Oh, they can fly.

3831
01:57:43,670 --> 01:57:45,670
Oh, what an explosion killed me.

3832
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:45,970
What?

3833
01:57:46,170 --> 01:57:47,250
You guys have one res.

3834
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:47,870
You guys are fine.

3835
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:49,150
Oh, no.

3836
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:50,190
But what about me?

3837
01:57:51,050 --> 01:57:52,430
I wanted that res.

3838
01:57:53,670 --> 01:57:56,650
Oh, god.

3839
01:57:59,050 --> 01:57:59,830
Okay, this way.

3840
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:00,290
Come up here.

3841
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:02,470
Actually, don't come up here.

3842
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:02,990
Don't come up here.

3843
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:03,590
Okay, I'm not coming over.

3844
01:58:03,670 --> 01:58:04,290
I'm not coming over.

3845
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:06,910
Nice landing.

3846
01:58:07,170 --> 01:58:07,950
You guys are doing great.

3847
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:09,170
You guys are gonna live.

3848
01:58:09,470 --> 01:58:10,390
You guys are gonna survive.

3849
01:58:10,730 --> 01:58:11,290
We're gonna live.

3850
01:58:12,690 --> 01:58:13,710
I believe in us.

3851
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:15,650
Okay.

3852
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:19,030
Oh, no.

3853
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:19,470
There's a robot.

3854
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:20,610
There's a shield.

3855
01:58:20,690 --> 01:58:21,110
Yeah, there's a shield.

3856
01:58:21,130 --> 01:58:22,070
I'm gonna throw my nade.

3857
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:22,930
I don't have nades.

3858
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:25,010
I'm shooting him in the cross.

3859
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:26,630
Nice, nice, nice.

3860
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:28,470
I'm dropping my nade.

3861
01:58:28,490 --> 01:58:29,110
I dropped the nade.

3862
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:30,090
I'm going to go.

3863
01:58:30,290 --> 01:58:31,250
I'm going to go.

3864
01:58:32,570 --> 01:58:33,370
Oh, my goodness.

3865
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:34,890
That's so bad.

3866
01:58:34,930 --> 01:58:35,390
That's so bad.

3867
01:58:35,830 --> 01:58:35,890
Run, run, run, run.

3868
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:37,490
Run, run, run.

3869
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:40,250
I'm trying my best to run.

3870
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:41,030
Just run.

3871
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:42,930
He's coming in.

3872
01:58:44,930 --> 01:58:46,510
I lost so many frames there.

3873
01:58:51,570 --> 01:58:52,650
So, we did it.

3874
01:58:52,670 --> 01:58:53,350
The eagle worked.

3875
01:58:53,990 --> 01:58:54,510
Nice.

3876
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:55,430
That actually worked.

3877
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:56,970
Yeah, that actually worked.

3878
01:58:58,990 --> 01:58:59,510
Shit.

3879
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,810
No.

3880
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:03,010
Oh, that was dangerous.

3881
01:59:03,190 --> 01:59:04,730
Oh boy, I dodged it last minute.

3882
01:59:04,990 --> 01:59:05,490
Oh my god.

3883
01:59:05,790 --> 01:59:06,310
Han, was that...

3884
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:08,810
You guys are going through war and I'm over here just...

3885
01:59:08,810 --> 01:59:09,430
That was not me.

3886
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:10,090
Just chilling.

3887
01:59:10,430 --> 01:59:10,830
Han...

3888
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,770
It was the red one.

3889
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:13,370
It was the enemies.

3890
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:14,890
It wasn't me.

3891
01:59:17,730 --> 01:59:18,990
I can't stand for this abuse.

3892
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:19,710
Wow!

3893
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:22,430
Han, Han, remember everything we've done.

3894
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:24,050
Remember all the things we've done.

3895
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:25,710
Remember all the bots we killed together.

3896
01:59:25,870 --> 01:59:26,910
I just met you!

3897
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:29,590
Yeah, today's the first time we met, you know?

3898
01:59:29,650 --> 01:59:30,210
In the last two hours!

3899
01:59:30,210 --> 01:59:30,650
Remember what you...

3900
01:59:30,650 --> 01:59:31,350
Remember...

3901
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:32,730
The last two hours!

3902
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:33,310
Remember...

3903
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,870
Today's the first day we met.

3904
01:59:35,130 --> 01:59:35,830
I don't know what you're talking about.

3905
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:37,810
Yeah, and now we're as close as ever.

3906
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:38,350
War...

3907
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:40,790
War makes strong bonds.

3908
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:41,990
Brothers in arms.

3909
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:43,610
We're brothers in arms.

3910
01:59:43,650 --> 01:59:44,330
Remember that.

3911
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:46,890
I will say like...

3912
01:59:46,890 --> 01:59:50,350
You guys are alive for longer than I thought you would be.

3913
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:51,310
Did I do it?

3914
01:59:51,470 --> 01:59:52,190
Oh, I did it.

3915
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:53,270
I think.

3916
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:53,950
Yeah, we did it.

3917
01:59:54,030 --> 01:59:54,350
Whoa!

3918
01:59:56,110 --> 01:59:56,570
Five.

3919
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:57,870
Oh, we also have a resupply.

3920
01:59:57,970 --> 01:59:58,310
We should...

3921
01:59:58,310 --> 01:59:59,490
We can call it a resupply.

3922
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:00,010
One.

3923
02:00:00,010 --> 02:00:00,590
One.

3924
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:02,530
Yay!

3925
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:02,930
Blast off!

3926
02:00:04,110 --> 02:00:05,130
Resupply is coming in.

3927
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:07,510
So, RPR doesn't get it.

3928
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:09,350
I don't...

3929
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:10,030
Okay.

3930
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:11,030
She got...

3931
02:00:11,030 --> 02:00:11,510
Okay.

3932
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:13,350
I mean, I got all these down.

3933
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:14,270
That's kind of mean.

3934
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:20,630
After everything I've done for you guys, she's like, Yeah, let's just fuck them.

3935
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:24,170
Hey, we got the nuclear!

3936
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:26,050
The launch codes!

3937
02:00:26,270 --> 02:00:26,890
We did that.

3938
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:27,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3939
02:00:27,410 --> 02:00:28,790
And all the fucking sight objectives.

3940
02:00:29,270 --> 02:00:29,770
Yeah, but...

3941
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:31,430
That's better sight objectives.

3942
02:00:32,450 --> 02:00:33,170
Get UA's.

3943
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:34,830
So, by blasting that one...

3944
02:00:34,830 --> 02:00:36,570
We're not gonna be staying there when the money comes in.

3945
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:38,030
Let's go.

3946
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:38,950
Let's go.

3947
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:39,590
Yay!

3948
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:43,770
Dang, I should really watch the Starship Trooper movies again.

3949
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:44,570
This shit kinda hurts.

3950
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:45,450
Is that how you wanna watch it with me?

3951
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:46,390
I've never watched it before.

3952
02:00:46,570 --> 02:00:47,510
I've never watched it either.

3953
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:48,270
I've watched that first one you make.

3954
02:00:48,270 --> 02:00:50,210
Oh my gosh, we should watch it together after dinner.

3955
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:52,210
After dinner?

3956
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:52,630
Yeah.

3957
02:00:52,670 --> 02:00:54,910
We're gonna be like, oh, there's people shooting at us.

3958
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:55,330
Oh.

3959
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:56,770
Nice.

3960
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:57,690
Good job, RPR.

3961
02:00:57,690 --> 02:00:58,030
Yeah, we did it!

3962
02:00:58,370 --> 02:00:58,970
Thank you.

3963
02:00:58,970 --> 02:00:59,330
Thank you.

3964
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:00,030
We're all here.

3965
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:01,850
We're all here.

3966
02:01:03,170 --> 02:01:04,270
There's like a guy in red.

3967
02:01:04,670 --> 02:01:05,430
Look to your left, guys.

3968
02:01:05,570 --> 02:01:06,950
There's a spawner over there on the left side.

3969
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:08,310
Oh yeah, look at that.

3970
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:12,530
I'm gonna reload my gun real fast.

3971
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:14,390
Whoa!

3972
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:16,730
What was that?

3973
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:17,690
Was that another artillery?

3974
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:19,830
No, it was the wrong guy.

3975
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:20,650
Oh, okay.

3976
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:21,910
He's dead now.

3977
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:22,570
Okay.

3978
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:23,190
He's gotten murdered.

3979
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:25,290
Whoa!

3980
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:26,530
Whoa!

3981
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:28,130
Something is shooting us.

3982
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:28,590
Wait, wait, wait.

3983
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:29,050
That's a cannon.

3984
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:30,790
That's literally a cannon right in front of me.

3985
02:01:30,830 --> 02:01:32,830
There's literally a cannon right in front of me.

3986
02:01:32,910 --> 02:01:34,570
Does anybody have an orbital strike on that thing?

3987
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:34,730
I do!

3988
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:36,490
I got it, I got it, I got it.

3989
02:01:36,510 --> 02:01:36,810
I got it too.

3990
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:38,090
I think, I think, I got it.

3991
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:39,250
I got it, I got it.

3992
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:40,190
Leave it to me.

3993
02:01:40,330 --> 02:01:41,270
You already put it down?

3994
02:01:41,410 --> 02:01:42,830
Yeah, I put it down, put it down, put it down.

3995
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:43,750
Oh, shit, bitch.

3996
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:44,810
I'm right near the cannon.

3997
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:45,710
I'm gonna die, yo.

3998
02:01:45,870 --> 02:01:46,350
It's okay, it's okay.

3999
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:46,930
You'll be fine.

4000
02:01:47,310 --> 02:01:47,830
Just don't look at it.

4001
02:01:47,830 --> 02:01:48,590
It ain't okay, fine.

4002
02:01:49,490 --> 02:01:51,110
If you don't look at it, you'll be fine.

4003
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:51,710
Cool, dude, don't look at explosions.

4004
02:01:53,490 --> 02:01:53,810
Nice.

4005
02:01:53,810 --> 02:01:55,110
I don't know... oh.

4006
02:01:55,290 --> 02:01:57,590
Oh, yeah, just a small army got spawned on me.

4007
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:57,990
It's all good.

4008
02:01:58,130 --> 02:01:58,690
I see it.

4009
02:01:58,690 --> 02:02:00,190
It's not on us, so it's okay.

4010
02:02:00,410 --> 02:02:01,430
I don't think it's destroyed.

4011
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:02,010
I'm gonna go destroy it.

4012
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:03,150
Run down straight, guys.

4013
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:05,690
I don't think the tower got destroyed yet.

4014
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:06,750
I threw another one over there.

4015
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:07,330
Be careful.

4016
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:07,950
All right, it's fine.

4017
02:02:08,350 --> 02:02:09,450
We're not looking at it.

4018
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:11,850
Wait, so where is the...

4019
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:13,830
Where is the extraction?

4020
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:16,030
Pinged it right here.

4021
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:17,630
All right, we'll follow you, Hod.

4022
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:20,390
See that little orange?

4023
02:02:20,610 --> 02:02:20,850
Whoa!

4024
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:21,570
Whoa!

4025
02:02:22,050 --> 02:02:23,090
No, I do not.

4026
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:23,610
.

4027
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:26,850
Little orange arrow on the top.

4028
02:02:27,030 --> 02:02:27,910
Wait, is this supply?

4029
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:28,790
What's this?

4030
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:30,850
Hey, guys, I need a reinforced...

4031
02:02:30,850 --> 02:02:31,610
Oh, metal.

4032
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:33,090
I stole the metal.

4033
02:02:33,390 --> 02:02:34,210
Oh, it's okay.

4034
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:34,990
It's all of us.

4035
02:02:34,990 --> 02:02:35,310
We all get it.

4036
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:35,990
Everyone gets it.

4037
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:38,090
Yeah, I was gonna say we all get it.

4038
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:39,230
No, you just look like a bad person.

4039
02:02:39,450 --> 02:02:40,490
Oh, we have... there's ammo.

4040
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:41,070
There's grenades.

4041
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:42,470
Oh.

4042
02:02:43,090 --> 02:02:43,450
Nice.

4043
02:02:44,130 --> 02:02:44,970
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4044
02:02:45,490 --> 02:02:48,410
RPI used our reinforcements?

4045
02:02:49,690 --> 02:02:51,750
Yeah, I used one out of the...

4046
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:52,310
.

4047
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:52,690
.

4048
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:56,530
What do you mean?

4049
02:02:56,650 --> 02:02:57,410
What do you mean?

4050
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:58,890
The ones that we used.

4051
02:02:59,550 --> 02:03:01,970
Wow, I can't believe you wasted our one.

4052
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:03,130
Guys, I'm stuck.

4053
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:04,710
Guys, I'm stuck.

4054
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:05,810
Don't go that way.

4055
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:07,650
Don't go that way, Sly.

4056
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:08,790
Don't go that way.

4057
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:09,970
I need help.

4058
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,430
I need help.

4059
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:12,070
I need so much help.

4060
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:14,250
Oh, he needs help, but he's dead anyways.

4061
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:14,910
It's okay.

4062
02:03:14,910 --> 02:03:16,270
Yeah, we have a minute left.

4063
02:03:16,330 --> 02:03:17,510
There's so many samples there.

4064
02:03:17,670 --> 02:03:17,930
No.

4065
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:18,930
That's all right.

4066
02:03:19,710 --> 02:03:20,430
Don't worry, guys.

4067
02:03:20,490 --> 02:03:21,670
Let's show them that we...

4068
02:03:21,670 --> 02:03:22,970
We don't need his guidance.

4069
02:03:23,090 --> 02:03:24,370
We're strong enough.

4070
02:03:24,970 --> 02:03:25,710
We're strong.

4071
02:03:26,170 --> 02:03:27,290
Babies together strong.

4072
02:03:28,270 --> 02:03:29,870
We don't want to play with you anymore.

4073
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:32,510
Rip the samples, man.

4074
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:34,130
I worked so hard for them bitches.

4075
02:03:34,730 --> 02:03:35,990
We're coming over, Han.

4076
02:03:36,730 --> 02:03:37,770
We're coming over.

4077
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:39,490
Let's go.

4078
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:40,190
Channel 8 bounce.

4079
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:41,490
Oh my god, we're going to get extraction.

4080
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,510
That's right.

4081
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:45,230
We're going to get extraction.

4082
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:46,650
I'm stuck.

4083
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:47,710
I'm stuck.

4084
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:49,110
Guys, stop.

4085
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:50,150
.

4086
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:50,290
.

4087
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:50,490
.

4088
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:50,530
.

4089
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:52,490
This is going great.

4090
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:53,890
Don't go that way.

4091
02:03:55,730 --> 02:03:57,250
Okay, easy, easy, easy.

4092
02:03:57,270 --> 02:03:58,150
See, we made it.

4093
02:03:58,310 --> 02:03:58,610
We made it.

4094
02:03:59,310 --> 02:04:00,630
30 seconds on each point.

4095
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:01,110
Okay, okay, okay.

4096
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:01,670
I have...

4097
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:02,630
I also have a gun.

4098
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:04,050
.

4099
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:05,970
Gatling gun.

4100
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:06,510
Here you go.

4101
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:08,770
I know this will be helpful right here.

4102
02:04:09,010 --> 02:04:11,310
Oh, I can interact with these carts.

4103
02:04:11,730 --> 02:04:13,050
Yeah, it gives you information.

4104
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:14,150
Do not operate.

4105
02:04:14,410 --> 02:04:15,450
No, I thought I could.

4106
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:16,530
I thought I could ride on it.

4107
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:17,030
It's like...

4108
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:18,410
Oh, my favorite.

4109
02:04:18,570 --> 02:04:19,530
Oh, whoa.

4110
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:21,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4111
02:04:21,470 --> 02:04:22,270
But we don't have the...

4112
02:04:22,270 --> 02:04:22,530
.

4113
02:04:23,070 --> 02:04:25,090
We don't have, like, extra lives for it.

4114
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:27,090
We don't have extra lives for it.

4115
02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:28,550
Okay, okay.

4116
02:04:29,410 --> 02:04:31,370
No, you don't want to do that.

4117
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:31,710
I got you.

4118
02:04:31,830 --> 02:04:32,190
I got you.

4119
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:32,850
.

4120
02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:38,090
After all the money I just made you, you don't want to respawn me.

4121
02:04:38,730 --> 02:04:39,490
It's crazy.

4122
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:40,530
.

4123
02:04:42,590 --> 02:04:42,970
Whoa.

4124
02:04:43,450 --> 02:04:43,830
Whoa!

4125
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:45,190
Shield generator!

4126
02:04:45,730 --> 02:04:46,350
What the fuck?

4127
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:46,730
What the fuck?

4128
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:48,730
What the fuck?

4129
02:04:49,950 --> 02:04:51,110
That's fucked up.

4130
02:04:52,450 --> 02:04:53,590
That's fucked up.

4131
02:04:55,250 --> 02:04:57,430
Can I shoot through this or do I...

4132
02:04:57,430 --> 02:04:58,590
Yes, you can shoot through it.

4133
02:04:59,090 --> 02:05:00,610
That's why it was like a Gibby shield.

4134
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:02,510
It only lasts for a certain amount of time though.

4135
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:04,930
How did I explode?

4136
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:06,850
No!

4137
02:05:07,610 --> 02:05:08,750
I have samples!

4138
02:05:10,130 --> 02:05:12,510
Yeah, I'm trying to pick them out but it's not really going well for me.

4139
02:05:13,930 --> 02:05:16,990
So many fucking guys on me!

4140
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:19,050
Oh my gosh.

4141
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:20,130
Oh fuck!

4142
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:21,510
Oh fuck me!

4143
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:25,250
Guys, it's okay.

4144
02:05:25,290 --> 02:05:26,710
I'm watching from my dead body.

4145
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:27,590
Guys!

4146
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:29,510
In one minute I come back!

4147
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:31,730
Don't worry!

4148
02:05:32,090 --> 02:05:33,870
I'm gonna throw the orbital strike in the center.

4149
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:37,430
Guys, if I wasn't dead I could have killed my cluster.

4150
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:37,850
Hopefully that's not something.

4151
02:05:38,650 --> 02:05:39,410
On the left!

4152
02:05:39,490 --> 02:05:39,710
On the left!

4153
02:05:39,730 --> 02:05:40,010
Behind us!

4154
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:44,630
Too far from extract...

4155
02:05:44,630 --> 02:05:44,750
Wait!

4156
02:05:44,810 --> 02:05:46,910
The shuttle is aborting in 12 seconds!

4157
02:05:46,990 --> 02:05:47,070
That's okay!

4158
02:05:47,070 --> 02:05:47,430
That's okay!

4159
02:05:47,810 --> 02:05:49,130
My body!

4160
02:05:51,150 --> 02:05:52,310
My fucking body!

4161
02:05:53,590 --> 02:05:54,990
It's already dead!

4162
02:05:55,710 --> 02:05:57,810
There's so many of these chainsaw bros.

4163
02:05:57,910 --> 02:05:58,430
Got him.

4164
02:05:58,430 --> 02:05:58,670
Got one.

4165
02:06:00,770 --> 02:06:01,610
Guys, don't worry.

4166
02:06:01,690 --> 02:06:02,610
I'm gonna land on a robot.

4167
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:04,530
I'm gonna land on one of them.

4168
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:05,570
Kobe!

4169
02:06:08,270 --> 02:06:09,170
Last reload!

4170
02:06:09,170 --> 02:06:09,170
Last reload!

4171
02:06:09,410 --> 02:06:10,050
Not good.

4172
02:06:10,650 --> 02:06:11,550
I'm coming in!

4173
02:06:11,690 --> 02:06:12,590
Oh wait, that's not me.

4174
02:06:12,690 --> 02:06:15,130
Sorry, I thought I was coming in.

4175
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:16,230
Holy shit.

4176
02:06:16,990 --> 02:06:18,030
I thought you said you were gonna land on one of them.

4177
02:06:18,090 --> 02:06:19,230
You land on someone else.

4178
02:06:19,930 --> 02:06:20,570
That's crazy.

4179
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:24,630
I'm out of ammo.

4180
02:06:24,850 --> 02:06:25,750
I'm out of ammo too.

4181
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:27,670
Guys!

4182
02:06:27,670 --> 02:06:28,250
It's okay!

4183
02:06:28,530 --> 02:06:29,990
I have an eagle cluster.

4184
02:06:30,710 --> 02:06:31,510
Oh no.

4185
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:32,170
Get me in there!

4186
02:06:33,290 --> 02:06:34,090
Oh no.

4187
02:06:36,610 --> 02:06:37,830
She has eagle cluster.

4188
02:06:37,870 --> 02:06:38,610
I have eagle cluster.

4189
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:39,470
Don't worry!

4190
02:06:42,450 --> 02:06:42,850
Guys!

4191
02:06:43,770 --> 02:06:44,170
Guys?

4192
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:46,670
I'm trying to...

4193
02:06:47,370 --> 02:06:47,930
Guys?

4194
02:06:50,050 --> 02:06:51,170
I'm surviving!

4195
02:06:52,790 --> 02:06:53,830
I spawned her.

4196
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:54,950
Nice.

4197
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:56,730
Who died?

4198
02:06:57,290 --> 02:06:59,910
I got like three chainsaw guys on me, bro.

4199
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:02,070
They want my ass so bad.

4200
02:07:02,070 --> 02:07:02,610
I got you.

4201
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:03,190
I got you.

4202
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:05,590
I got no ass, man.

4203
02:07:05,990 --> 02:07:06,550
Nice.

4204
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:09,850
I have eagle cluster.

4205
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:13,510
I'm playing with a fucking handgun right now.

4206
02:07:13,510 --> 02:07:14,010
Focus the back.

4207
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:14,550
Focus the back.

4208
02:07:14,570 --> 02:07:15,490
I got the orbito.

4209
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:17,790
Focus the back.

4210
02:07:18,690 --> 02:07:19,290
There's a gun.

4211
02:07:19,370 --> 02:07:19,850
There's a gun here.

4212
02:07:20,810 --> 02:07:21,990
I'm getting fucked on.

4213
02:07:22,210 --> 02:07:23,410
I'm getting fucked on.

4214
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:25,850
I'm picking up the guns.

4215
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,790
No!

4216
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:28,630
Okay.

4217
02:07:30,150 --> 02:07:31,710
I'm gonna put out my gatling gun.

4218
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:32,890
Oh fuck.

4219
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:33,650
Run, Zelly!

4220
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:34,130
Run!

4221
02:07:34,430 --> 02:07:35,990
Split up!

4222
02:07:36,090 --> 02:07:36,490
Split up!

4223
02:07:36,630 --> 02:07:37,470
I'm splitting up.

4224
02:07:37,490 --> 02:07:38,150
I'm splitting up.

4225
02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:40,470
I can't split up because the shuttle is inbound.

4226
02:07:42,330 --> 02:07:42,730
Okay.

4227
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:45,530
There's the flamethrower guys on me.

4228
02:07:46,010 --> 02:07:46,690
Shuttle's approaching!

4229
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:47,270
Shuttle's approaching!

4230
02:07:47,790 --> 02:07:48,950
I'm throwing nades for you!

4231
02:07:50,570 --> 02:07:51,670
I'm going to the shuttle!

4232
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:52,690
I'll be able to pick it.

4233
02:07:53,210 --> 02:07:54,030
Oh god.

4234
02:07:54,650 --> 02:07:56,650
I'm dodging all his moves right now.

4235
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:57,790
Faker!

4236
02:07:59,830 --> 02:08:00,690
Guys, get in!

4237
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:01,090
Get in!

4238
02:08:01,130 --> 02:08:01,470
Get in!

4239
02:08:03,390 --> 02:08:04,070
Get in!

4240
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:04,670
No, no, no.

4241
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:05,670
Wait 45 seconds.

4242
02:08:05,850 --> 02:08:07,090
Sorry, hun.

4243
02:08:09,810 --> 02:08:11,130
I see you don't care.

4244
02:08:11,530 --> 02:08:12,590
He did as well.

4245
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:14,130
He does as well.

4246
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:16,710
I couldn't make it.

4247
02:08:16,770 --> 02:08:19,250
No, but I distracted the flamethrower guys long enough.

4248
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:21,090
He fucking...

4249
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:22,950
He fucking killed me!

4250
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:29,110
I held on to them.

4251
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:30,010
I held on to them.

4252
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:34,140
Holy shit.

4253
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:36,040
My last bullet in her head.

4254
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:37,780
Oh my god.

4255
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:41,060
Oh my god.

4256
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:42,580
I can't believe it.

4257
02:08:42,580 --> 02:08:43,540
I'm so proud of you, RPR.

4258
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:44,500
Well done.

4259
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:48,380
Space Shift Prime.

4260
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:49,080
All the gets.

4261
02:08:49,120 --> 02:08:49,900
Gets it done, you know.

4262
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,540
The one helldiver that got extracted.

4263
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:55,860
The one true.

4264
02:08:55,880 --> 02:08:57,640
How many side missions I've done that...

4265
02:08:58,300 --> 02:08:59,540
You didn't do all of them.

4266
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:02,640
Because someone decided to...

4267
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:03,420
What happened to your teammates?

4268
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:04,780
What teammates?

4269
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:05,500
I went in alone.

4270
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,700
We got four stars though.

4271
02:09:07,820 --> 02:09:08,600
We got four stars.

4272
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:11,760
You're totally kidding.

4273
02:09:12,860 --> 02:09:16,560
That last fight felt like teamwork at the end there.

4274
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:17,720
You know what I'm saying.

4275
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:18,460
I know.

4276
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:21,180
That was like a team play right there.

4277
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:21,760
Oh yeah.

4278
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:22,540
Yeah.

4279
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:26,640
There's definitely so much teamwork going on.

4280
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:29,700
Well on our end, I don't know about you.

4281
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:30,480
Yeah, we made it to the end.

4282
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:32,480
I did nothing for the team at all.

4283
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:33,720
My bad guys.

4284
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:35,780
We did the main objective that progressed the game.

4285
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:38,580
We did the main objective that progressed the game.

4286
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:40,160
Look at this dude.

4287
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:41,160
Look at this one guy.

4288
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:44,160
Look at you guys dead on the side.

4289
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:45,040
Don't talk to me.

4290
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:49,660
Talk about the stats man.

4291
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:51,960
Oh shit.

4292
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:57,520
How are you consistently doing so much team damage?

4293
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:58,480
How are you consistently doing so much team damage?

4294
02:09:58,480 --> 02:09:59,000
I don't know.

4295
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:02,120
I tried not to.

4296
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:04,380
He died eight times again.

4297
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:05,220
You got shots.

4298
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:07,300
Look at your shots fired too.

4299
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:09,900
Friendly fire damage.

4300
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:12,700
But I have better accuracy than you.

4301
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:16,700
I mean if you're shooting us, yeah your accuracy is higher.

4302
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:18,260
Because you're shooting us.

4303
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:19,900
Hell no.

4304
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:21,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

4305
02:10:21,860 --> 02:10:24,790
That was crazy bro.

4306
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:27,020
We did it guys.

4307
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,660
I think we have one more.

4308
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:31,980
You're literally ten kills above me.

4309
02:10:32,220 --> 02:10:34,360
We like tripled the fucking shots.

4310
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:35,300
One more?

4311
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,200
To finish this mission we have to do this.

4312
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:41,260
We have to do this.

4313
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:41,420
Oh wait.

4314
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:43,160
Zeller come over here.

4315
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:44,260
You need to upgrade your gear.

4316
02:10:44,380 --> 02:10:44,860
Come over here.

4317
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:46,080
Go to here.

4318
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:48,580
You guys have good gear.

4319
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:50,600
And you guys are trying to compare to me.

4320
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:52,360
Go to strategy gym and buy stuff.

4321
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:54,180
What should I buy?

4322
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:56,880
Oh my god there's anti-tank.

4323
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:00,620
I'm gonna buy anti-tank.

4324
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:03,140
Anti-tank?

4325
02:11:03,140 --> 02:11:04,880
I had 50 friendly fire damage.

4326
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:06,340
It was me hatcheting the king.

4327
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:07,560
No.

4328
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:10,940
Yo, wait they have flamethrowers.

4329
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:11,660
Shit.

4330
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:14,680
Wooo.

4331
02:11:14,860 --> 02:11:15,400
Wait.

4332
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:18,140
I can have anti-personnel minefield.

4333
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:19,580
Does it like?

4334
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:20,560
Oh that sounds horrible.

4335
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:23,260
Does it affect you guys.

4336
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:24,320
Does it?

4337
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:25,940
Wow.

4338
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:28,740
I'm gonna buy it.

4339
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:31,980
Oh boy.

4340
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:34,860
It's okay I'll buy the anti-tank.

4341
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:38,740
I'll help.

4342
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:40,460
We're the normal ones here.

4343
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:41,680
I'm helping.

4344
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:42,780
We're ready.

4345
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:45,040
Wait, hold up, let me cook.

4346
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:48,020
Wait, there's a flamethrower?

4347
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:51,220
Wait, I want a flamethrower.

4348
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:52,800
Where is that?

4349
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:54,020
Oh, I'm too old.

4350
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:55,940
It's level 10.

4351
02:11:57,580 --> 02:11:58,560
Wait, wait, wait.

4352
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,220
Let me cook to have a board.

4353
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:03,140
You have 24 seconds.

4354
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:05,340
What am I gonna buy, bro?

4355
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:06,340
What am I gonna buy?

4356
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:07,300
Buy the mine.

4357
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:08,680
Anti-personnel mine.

4358
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:09,220
We're good.

4359
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:12,140
Anti-personnel mine?

4360
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:12,580
What is that?

4361
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:14,200
It's the mine.

4362
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:17,680
No, that's gonna kill us all, bro.

4363
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:19,780
Get the mine.

4364
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:20,260
What do you mean?

4365
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:21,760
It's gonna kill us all.

4366
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,800
No, it won't.

4367
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:24,900
Believe in yourself.

4368
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:28,420
I have a grenade launcher, though.

4369
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:29,860
I might use the grenade launcher.

4370
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:32,160
But this shit's so expensive.

4371
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:32,820
6000 dollars.

4372
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:34,160
Fucking bucks, bro?

4373
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:35,640
You'll have enough.

4374
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:37,240
We made a lot of money.

4375
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:38,780
No, we did not.

4376
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:43,100
Well, we're supposed to have made a lot of money.

4377
02:12:43,180 --> 02:12:44,720
I was able to buy like three things.

4378
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,300
Where were you spending your money on, Zeller?

4379
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:49,300
How about orbital...

4380
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:50,220
Wait, I'm gonna get him and laugh.

4381
02:12:50,860 --> 02:12:52,340
How about orbital...

4382
02:12:54,220 --> 02:12:54,700
Orbital...

4383
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:56,800
Eagle cluster bomb.

4384
02:12:56,980 --> 02:12:57,860
Seems pretty cool.

4385
02:12:58,720 --> 02:12:59,340
Oh, no.

4386
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:03,120
I worry about Zeller having more and more...

4387
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:03,500
I have!

4388
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:04,300
That's so good!

4389
02:13:04,820 --> 02:13:07,600
Eagle napalm airstrike.

4390
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:08,260
I'm getting this one.

4391
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:09,220
Oh, shit.

4392
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:12,020
I wanna change my helmet.

4393
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:13,760
Wait, where's the...

4394
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:16,340
How do I buy stuff again?

4395
02:13:16,540 --> 02:13:17,200
Is it in the armory?

4396
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,040
I press R.

4397
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:21,600
Oh, I need a gun as well.

4398
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:25,280
How much medals do I have?

4399
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:26,680
Bro, I don't even have anything.

4400
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:27,480
War bonds.

4401
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:29,160
37.

4402
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:31,680
You have to buy everything to unlock it?

4403
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:32,240
Yeah.

4404
02:13:33,340 --> 02:13:33,860
Alright.

4405
02:13:34,580 --> 02:13:35,100
Move.

4406
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:38,660
Wait.

4407
02:13:39,100 --> 02:13:42,660
This expendable anti-tank one, right?

4408
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:44,480
This expendable anti-tank one, right?

4409
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:45,900
This one, can you destroy turrets with it?

4410
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:48,360
Can I unlock the homepage?

4411
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:49,480
I think so, right?

4412
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:52,200
Oh my god, I got finger guns!

4413
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:54,460
Guys, we have to be...

4414
02:13:54,460 --> 02:13:56,920
What the fuck is a finger gun?

4415
02:13:56,920 --> 02:13:57,800
You get the shit from the fingers?

4416
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:00,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got finger guns as my victory pose.

4417
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:02,000
That's cheating.

4418
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:03,960
Well, you...press R!

4419
02:14:04,220 --> 02:14:04,780
Press R!

4420
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,720
It's literally in the battle pass.

4421
02:14:07,780 --> 02:14:09,680
Oh, you bought a battle pass.

4422
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:10,500
No, it's free.

4423
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:12,420
It's a free battle pass.

4424
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:14,040
It's a free battle pass.

4425
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:15,500
You're such an idiot.

4426
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:19,300
You're supposed to use it.

4427
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:20,560
Where's the free battle pass?

4428
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:21,220
To get better weapons.

4429
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:22,020
Press R.

4430
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:23,380
Press R and then the...

4431
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:25,620
Helldivers mobilize.

4432
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:29,060
You buy guns here and stuff.

4433
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:31,640
Oh, claim item.

4434
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:33,280
Let's see...

4435
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:34,600
Oh shit, I can claim everything!

4436
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:35,340
Fuck!

4437
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:38,600
Oh my god.

4438
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:39,960
Do I unlock page 3?

4439
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:41,680
I unlocked page 3!

4440
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:43,760
Oh my god, I have a new helmet!

4441
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:46,540
But I can have an orange cape!

4442
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,260
So you know who I am.

4443
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:49,400
Let's go!

4444
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:54,020
I guess I'm gonna save up for the stamina enhancement.

4445
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:55,060
That was pretty good.

4446
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:56,900
Yeah, you're kinda lacking in that.

4447
02:14:56,920 --> 02:14:57,820
Yeah.

4448
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:00,620
Look at my orange cape, guys.

4449
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:04,780
Guys, I'm so cool now.

4450
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:06,620
Look at me.

4451
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:08,380
Helldivers to Hellpods.

4452
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:09,400
My cape is orange.

4453
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:11,080
Helldivers to Hellpods.

4454
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:13,900
Oh yeah?

4455
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:15,060
Her cape is orange.

4456
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:16,100
My cape is orange.

4457
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:19,180
I mean, look at me compared to Zeller.

4458
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:22,520
So you know I'm the richer one here.

4459
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:23,100
Don't come here.

4460
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:23,840
You paid the win.

4461
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:25,880
You paid real money.

4462
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:28,780
You're a super citizen.

4463
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:29,680
You paid.

4464
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:32,180
Wait, why is my title a super citizen?

4465
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:32,840
I changed it.

4466
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:36,040
You're trying to hide the shame.

4467
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:37,000
No, no, no.

4468
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:37,840
Look, look, look.

4469
02:15:38,060 --> 02:15:39,120
I have a better title.

4470
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:41,100
I have a better title.

4471
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:43,420
Super Sheef Prime.

4472
02:15:43,820 --> 02:15:44,760
I'm a Super Sheef Prime.

4473
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:46,840
Super Sheef Prime.

4474
02:15:48,380 --> 02:15:49,140
He's a sheep.

4475
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:51,000
Twitch Prime.

4476
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:56,980
Alright, go to TokiBird at Twitch and give Twitch Prime.

4477
02:15:57,500 --> 02:15:58,020
Okay, dude.

4478
02:15:58,660 --> 02:16:00,680
Listen, Twitch Priming RPR.

4479
02:16:00,780 --> 02:16:04,140
Go to TokiBird at Twitch and put your Twitch Prime there.

4480
02:16:04,340 --> 02:16:06,380
You're stealing from smaller streamers now?

4481
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:07,060
That's kind of lame.

4482
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:08,860
What do you mean?

4483
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:11,140
You've been streaming longer than me.

4484
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:12,400
I started two weeks ago.

4485
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:14,340
Yeah, yeah.

4486
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:15,640
Two weeks ago, yeah.

4487
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:18,220
You're still a big streamer though.

4488
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:20,040
I'm not a stream either, man.

4489
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:20,840
Wow.

4490
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:21,940
Wow.

4491
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:26,500
Wait, Han, what's your Twitch channel?

4492
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:27,780
What's your Twitch channel?

4493
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:29,560
Twitch.tv slash HanGa.

4494
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:31,940
Yeah, guys, you can Twitch Prime there.

4495
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:33,900
No, don't worry about it.

4496
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:35,280
I don't stream.

4497
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:37,620
Wait, where's my...

4498
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:39,320
Where's the one I got?

4499
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:41,480
Look, now I have two orbital attacks.

4500
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:45,620
For this one, we're going to be destroying fabricators.

4501
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:48,440
So we need to have all the destruction that we could possibly get.

4502
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:50,000
Hell yeah, leave it to me.

4503
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:51,520
I got Eagle Cluster.

4504
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:55,120
I got the better Eagle Cluster, so...

4505
02:16:56,480 --> 02:16:57,860
It's not a competition, man.

4506
02:16:58,980 --> 02:17:00,140
Hell yeah, it is.

4507
02:17:00,180 --> 02:17:00,840
Now it is.

4508
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:02,980
Now it is.

4509
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:07,080
Well, you have two clusters.

4510
02:17:07,460 --> 02:17:09,380
That sounds extremely promising.

4511
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:10,260
I have a cluster too.

4512
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:11,300
Three.

4513
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,860
And I both have Eagle Cluster.

4514
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:15,100
Yeah, it's great.

4515
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,440
What can go wrong?

4516
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:20,480
Boom.

4517
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:21,980
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

4518
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:23,080
Boom, boom.

4519
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:28,020
Lisa.

4520
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:31,640
Alright, let's destroy.

4521
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:32,920
Oh, there's already one there.

4522
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:33,940
Orange cape.

4523
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:35,580
If I didn't destroy any active...

4524
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:37,100
Whoa, holy shit.

4525
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:39,520
Holy shit, why they're already here, yo?

4526
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:40,820
That's a lot.

4527
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,740
Oh, fuck.

4528
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:45,940
Careful, careful, careful.

4529
02:17:46,540 --> 02:17:47,720
Wait, that's not what I wanted.

4530
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:48,760
Shoot the guys back.

4531
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:49,400
Shoot the guys back.

4532
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:49,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4533
02:17:50,060 --> 02:17:50,500
Oh, shit.

4534
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:51,720
I need to grab my gun.

4535
02:17:51,860 --> 02:17:53,420
I need to grab my anti-personnel.

4536
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:57,400
Wait, who the fuck activated the patrol?

4537
02:18:00,060 --> 02:18:00,780
Was it me?

4538
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:02,960
Grabbing my anti-personnel.

4539
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:04,540
I'm gonna destroy purple.

4540
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:05,340
See you guys.

4541
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:06,800
Alright.

4542
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:09,640
Are we spawning this shit?

4543
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:10,080
Fuck.

4544
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:12,260
I'm waiting for my...

4545
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:13,480
I got me machine gun.

4546
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:14,420
Oh, fuck.

4547
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:15,180
What is that?

4548
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:16,340
Why are there so many of them?

4549
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:18,500
Just run to where Hani's running.

4550
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:19,300
Just go, Hani.

4551
02:18:20,540 --> 02:18:21,320
I missed.

4552
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:21,640
Yeah?

4553
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:25,260
It don't really seem like you got us.

4554
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:26,820
It's okay.

4555
02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:27,600
I actually...

4556
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:28,760
I actually got us.

4557
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:31,000
I got you guys this time.

4558
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:32,260
Oh, I hit it!

4559
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:34,000
Nice.

4560
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:34,440
I did it.

4561
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:34,740
I did it.

4562
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:35,080
I did it.

4563
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:35,420
I'm heading back.

4564
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:40,000
She says that as she keeps running in the opposite direction of where she's supposed to be running.

4565
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:41,420
I'm coming over now.

4566
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:43,420
I'm heading over now.

4567
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:46,180
Look, it's the...

4568
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:48,700
It's the end result, not the journey.

4569
02:18:49,820 --> 02:18:50,620
Oh, shit.

4570
02:18:50,720 --> 02:18:52,900
I thought it was the journey that matters, not the end result.

4571
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:55,200
No, it's the end result that matters.

4572
02:18:55,520 --> 02:18:56,540
Yeah, that's true.

4573
02:18:57,620 --> 02:18:58,300
I'm heading over.

4574
02:18:58,380 --> 02:18:58,780
I'm heading over.

4575
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:00,780
My stamina's not as great right now.

4576
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:01,440
Land mine!

4577
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:02,460
Let me pop this shit.

4578
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:03,300
Off to the west.

4579
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:05,100
Alright.

4580
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:06,380
Wait, Arpyr, where are you going?

4581
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:07,920
Wait, there's trenches here.

4582
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:09,080
Uh, side... side mission.

4583
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,940
Oh, oh, oh, something hit me.

4584
02:19:10,980 --> 02:19:11,700
Something fucking hit me.

4585
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:12,060
There's artillery.

4586
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:13,340
There's artillery hitting me.

4587
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:15,160
Careful, careful, careful.

4588
02:19:15,320 --> 02:19:15,740
I'm coming over.

4589
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:16,100
I'm coming over.

4590
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:18,580
Wait, we have turrets here.

4591
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:19,160
We have turrets here.

4592
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:19,820
We can use these.

4593
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:20,040
We have turrets here.

4594
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:20,680
There's turrets here.

4595
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:21,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4596
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:22,120
I'm gonna get the turrets.

4597
02:19:22,680 --> 02:19:23,540
We got ten minutes.

4598
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:26,000
I don't know if these turrets are really gonna be that useful, though.

4599
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,920
Okay, they're not that useful.

4600
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:27,620
They're not that useful.

4601
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:28,280
I'm heading over to hide.

4602
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:28,540
Yeah.

4603
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:29,980
I'm heading over to hide.

4604
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:30,600
Oh, god.

4605
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:34,100
Uh, uh, I don't know if you wanna come towards me.

4606
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:35,500
Yeah, I don't know anymore.

4607
02:19:35,700 --> 02:19:37,080
There's so many of them here.

4608
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:39,380
Leave me.

4609
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:40,180
It's time to go solo.

4610
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:41,820
No, don't go solo.

4611
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:44,160
I don't need you anymore.

4612
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:44,740
No!

4613
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:45,500
Excellent documentation.

4614
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:48,660
Okay, so we stick together and finish that one.

4615
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:49,760
I'm gonna finish one here.

4616
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:50,520
Wait, there's a railgun here.

4617
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:51,320
There's a railgun on me.

4618
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:52,700
Okay, I cannot...

4619
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:54,980
Oh, get away.

4620
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:57,160
I'm sure nothing can go wrong if you guys are together, right?

4621
02:19:57,320 --> 02:19:58,280
I got the big one.

4622
02:19:58,940 --> 02:19:59,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4623
02:19:59,380 --> 02:20:00,320
I have one stim left.

4624
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:01,120
Everything's fine.

4625
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:02,200
Oh, hey!

4626
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:02,940
Oh, no!

4627
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:05,280
Zeller and Dokki, you guys stick together.

4628
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,060
Han, you get the one.

4629
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:08,020
And I get the one.

4630
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:09,540
And then we'll maybe get all of them.

4631
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:11,020
In ten minutes.

4632
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:12,740
Oh, my god.

4633
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:15,720
Oh, my god.

4634
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:19,120
There's so many people!

4635
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:22,760
Zeller!

4636
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:23,440
Zeller!

4637
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:25,200
Huh?

4638
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:26,180
Reinforcements!

4639
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:29,380
Yeah, yeah, I gotta send you back in, eh?

4640
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:31,320
Get your bitch ass back in.

4641
02:20:31,480 --> 02:20:32,480
I can't see shit!

4642
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:35,540
Get your bitch ass back in here.

4643
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:38,120
I'm here.

4644
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:40,440
Don't worry.

4645
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:41,820
I have my shotgun.

4646
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:43,800
I can throw a Gatling gun for us.

4647
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:44,080
Ammo.

4648
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:46,540
Oh, yeah, that's like...

4649
02:20:47,140 --> 02:20:47,500
Northwards.

4650
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:47,940
Purple ping.

4651
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:49,100
I got you, Zeller.

4652
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:49,520
Thank you, yo.

4653
02:20:52,500 --> 02:20:53,740
Let's go, go, go, go, go, go.

4654
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:55,220
Wait, is that a tank?

4655
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:56,100
No, it's not.

4656
02:20:56,180 --> 02:20:56,540
We're good.

4657
02:20:57,880 --> 02:20:58,540
Are we good?

4658
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:00,440
Let's go purple ping.

4659
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:01,380
I think so.

4660
02:21:01,580 --> 02:21:02,260
Purple ping.

4661
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:04,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, we're heading.

4662
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,360
Yeah, don't worry.

4663
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:06,540
Zeller and I are heading over.

4664
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:07,920
We're here.

4665
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:10,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're heading over.

4666
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:11,700
I should grab it.

4667
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:12,180
I'm gonna...

4668
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:14,820
Go grab a machine gun.

4669
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:15,460
Give me a sec.

4670
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:16,700
You're in green.

4671
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:17,680
Don't need help.

4672
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:21,440
My machine gun's coming over.

4673
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:23,720
In 12 seconds.

4674
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:26,540
You go up there for me, Zeller.

4675
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:27,960
I'm gonna grab my machine gun.

4676
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:29,620
Oh, yeah, go.

4677
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:31,480
You go grab that, girl.

4678
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:32,800
Don't worry.

4679
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:33,960
I'm coming over.

4680
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:35,340
Whoa!

4681
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:36,400
There's so many of them.

4682
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:38,560
It's a cannon.

4683
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:41,760
Oh, I'm having a rough time.

4684
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:43,460
Time for me to destroy that thing, I guess.

4685
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:45,920
Where's the cannon?

4686
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:46,880
Oh, I see the cannon.

4687
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:48,760
Leave it to me!

4688
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:50,180
Leave it to us!

4689
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:51,640
We have ego cluster!

4690
02:21:52,060 --> 02:21:53,500
Zeller, use your ego cluster!

4691
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:54,780
I got you!

4692
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:58,200
Does the ego cluster even destroy those things?

4693
02:21:58,460 --> 02:21:58,960
I don't know.

4694
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:01,080
Maybe I didn't throw it far enough.

4695
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:03,400
Maybe you didn't throw it far.

4696
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:04,500
Don't worry!

4697
02:22:04,780 --> 02:22:06,440
I'm gonna throw my ego cluster, too!

4698
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:07,680
Oh, it's jammed.

4699
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:08,060
Never mind.

4700
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:10,580
What do you mean it's jammed?

4701
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:11,280
Never mind.

4702
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:13,260
Apparently it's one ego cluster per person.

4703
02:22:13,260 --> 02:22:15,140
Oh no...

4704
02:22:15,140 --> 02:22:16,580
Okay, I'm getting close!

4705
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:17,700
Leave it to me!

4706
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:18,540
We're getting closer!

4707
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:21,240
I'm so stupid!

4708
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:24,600
Oh my god.

4709
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:25,520
I got you.

4710
02:22:25,880 --> 02:22:29,380
We did it!

4711
02:22:30,180 --> 02:22:31,160
We broke it!

4712
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:31,640
Nice!

4713
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:33,400
We just gotta get out of here.

4714
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:35,320
Ping south!

4715
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:39,080
Alright, we got this.

4716
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:43,240
We gotta go south.

4717
02:22:43,240 --> 02:22:45,060
I'm trying to get to the utility.

4718
02:22:45,940 --> 02:22:47,020
Wait, we gotta...

4719
02:22:47,020 --> 02:22:48,960
We gotta grab Zeller!

4720
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:50,300
Gotcha, gotcha.

4721
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:50,660
Okay.

4722
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:53,200
I'm gonna throw an ego cluster.

4723
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:55,500
Oh god.

4724
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:57,460
Oh, I couldn't grab it!

4725
02:22:57,640 --> 02:22:58,820
Oh no...

4726
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:00,080
It's okay, we have 16!

4727
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:01,320
Guys!

4728
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:03,980
I'm on a tank!

4729
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:04,480
Fuck!

4730
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:05,380
I'm on a tank!

4731
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:05,940
I'm on a tank!

4732
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:11,460
Here I am watching RPR and soloing the fucking tower.

4733
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:12,120
I'm gonna miss it!

4734
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:14,040
I'm on a tank!

4735
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:16,400
They're doing everything to me!

4736
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:17,880
They're doing all the unthinkable things to me!

4737
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:18,280
I got the tank!

4738
02:23:18,460 --> 02:23:18,780
I got the tank!

4739
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,280
They were doing all unthinkable things to me!

4740
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:22,660
I'm here!

4741
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:23,000
I'm here!

4742
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:24,620
We're okay!

4743
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:25,780
I need a resupply!

4744
02:23:27,460 --> 02:23:28,180
We're okay!

4745
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:28,900
We're okay!

4746
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:30,600
War never changes!

4747
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:32,760
I got it, I got it, I got it!

4748
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:33,940
Nice, nice, nice.

4749
02:23:34,660 --> 02:23:35,640
Oh my goodness!

4750
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,700
We all bunched up together.

4751
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:41,220
Nothing will happen to us, right?

4752
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:43,060
If we don't bunch up together.

4753
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:43,480
Nothing.

4754
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:46,280
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

4755
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,320
Alright, I'm gonna...

4756
02:23:49,660 --> 02:23:51,220
I'm gonna grab my...

4757
02:23:51,220 --> 02:23:53,000
Maybe my sentry gun can do stuff.

4758
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:54,520
Oh, okay.

4759
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:56,480
Oh, kinda hard.

4760
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:58,140
Wait, I can do an eagle cluster now!

4761
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:00,380
Ugh!

4762
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,080
But do we need it though?

4763
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:03,980
Do we need that eagle cluster?

4764
02:24:03,980 --> 02:24:06,680
I don't know, but there's like three things going on in there.

4765
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:08,740
Southwaters, we have five minutes guys!

4766
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:09,240
Come on!

4767
02:24:09,460 --> 02:24:09,960
Five minutes!

4768
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:12,320
Where's the extraction point?

4769
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:13,680
South, south, south!

4770
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:14,580
Okay, okay, okay.

4771
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:16,420
Right on me.

4772
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:17,240
I'm gonna start it.

4773
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:18,200
Alright, alright.

4774
02:24:19,380 --> 02:24:19,780
I'm here.

4775
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:24,260
Four minutes, we gotta survive.

4776
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:25,180
Alright.

4777
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:26,120
We can do that.

4778
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:28,340
I got the big boy!

4779
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:31,060
I threw my gundling thing already.

4780
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:32,580
Oh wait, I need to grab my...

4781
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:34,360
I'm gonna grab my anti-tank.

4782
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:36,540
I got the anti-tank as well.

4783
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:38,160
I'll be there in a second.

4784
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:40,840
Okay.

4785
02:24:41,020 --> 02:24:42,240
I have more eagle cluster!

4786
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:42,760
Don't worry!

4787
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:44,140
Oh no.

4788
02:24:46,360 --> 02:24:47,640
What do you mean oh no?

4789
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:49,980
It has been helpful!

4790
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:52,480
Yeah, for the other team.

4791
02:24:53,180 --> 02:24:54,080
That is a lie.

4792
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:56,000
That is a fucking lie.

4793
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,620
I'm a truther, nothing but a truther.

4794
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:58,500
That is a lie.

4795
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:01,020
Guys.

4796
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:02,620
Are you okay?

4797
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:03,760
I'll be there in a minute.

4798
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:07,360
Don't worry.

4799
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:10,760
Zeller and I were defending you.

4800
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:12,280
We're defending you at the point.

4801
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:13,260
We're just standing here.

4802
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:15,440
We're doing great guys.

4803
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:17,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4804
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:19,520
Look, we're killing so many over here.

4805
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:20,780
Oh my god, we're killing so many over here.

4806
02:25:20,820 --> 02:25:21,920
Look at us go!

4807
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:25,180
I have anti-personnel.

4808
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:28,860
You guys got any of them stims?

4809
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:31,300
Yeah, I got four stims left.

4810
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:32,880
Can you stim me?

4811
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:35,400
Where are you?

4812
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:36,120
You're too far man.

4813
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:39,220
You're too far.

4814
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:40,700
I think you gotta stim yourself bro.

4815
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:42,120
I don't have stims.

4816
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:44,100
Say pretty please.

4817
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:44,980
I've been looking for one.

4818
02:25:45,460 --> 02:25:46,100
You're fine.

4819
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:49,820
I'd rather die than beg you for a fucking stim, Bucky.

4820
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:51,020
I'd rather fucking die.

4821
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:53,720
I guess you die then.

4822
02:25:54,060 --> 02:25:55,640
I guess you die.

4823
02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:58,740
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

4824
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:01,020
That's a real homie.

4825
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:03,840
I got an achievement for that.

4826
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:04,380
I'm out!

4827
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:09,160
You are special.

4828
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:10,180
Spawn me in.

4829
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:12,240
Spawn me in.

4830
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:13,520
Look at all the loot!

4831
02:26:22,590 --> 02:26:23,270
Wow.

4832
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:25,190
Oh shit!

4833
02:26:25,410 --> 02:26:26,210
Killing me!

4834
02:26:27,910 --> 02:26:28,250
Ew!

4835
02:26:28,250 --> 02:26:29,130
I can't breathe!

4836
02:26:29,130 --> 02:26:33,470
I can't breathe!

4837
02:26:33,810 --> 02:26:34,950
It was an accident!

4838
02:26:35,610 --> 02:26:36,890
It was an accident!

4839
02:26:36,990 --> 02:26:37,650
I swear!

4840
02:26:38,250 --> 02:26:39,230
I swear!

4841
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:41,330
It was an accident!

4842
02:26:41,550 --> 02:26:42,030
Please!

4843
02:26:43,970 --> 02:26:44,930
Oh god!

4844
02:26:46,010 --> 02:26:46,330
No!

4845
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:48,470
No!

4846
02:26:48,650 --> 02:26:49,630
It's revenge!

4847
02:26:51,230 --> 02:26:52,750
Why would you kill me?

4848
02:26:52,770 --> 02:26:53,070
It's revenge!

4849
02:26:54,770 --> 02:26:56,430
They're here, they're here, they're here!

4850
02:26:56,610 --> 02:26:57,570
They're here!

4851
02:26:58,250 --> 02:26:58,550
Yay!

4852
02:27:00,150 --> 02:27:01,850
I wanna have some fun too, come on!

4853
02:27:01,970 --> 02:27:03,050
Yeah, you wanna have some fun?

4854
02:27:04,010 --> 02:27:05,130
No, I feel awful.

4855
02:27:05,790 --> 02:27:08,530
Yeah, we're just having fun.

4856
02:27:08,570 --> 02:27:09,110
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

4857
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:12,750
Wait, I can bring out my galleon.

4858
02:27:13,190 --> 02:27:13,570
Let's see.

4859
02:27:13,570 --> 02:27:15,450
I'm gonna bring out the Eagle Nepal Nail Strike.

4860
02:27:15,690 --> 02:27:16,750
Oh god, where?

4861
02:27:18,290 --> 02:27:19,830
Right over there, right in the center.

4862
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:21,210
Oh my god!

4863
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:23,610
Eagle, eagle, eagle strike, eagle strike.

4864
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:25,250
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

4865
02:27:25,510 --> 02:27:26,750
Oh look, look, it's gonna hit them all!

4866
02:27:26,790 --> 02:27:27,550
Look, it's gonna hit them all!

4867
02:27:28,370 --> 02:27:29,410
Look, it's gonna hit them all!

4868
02:27:29,590 --> 02:27:30,470
Look at that!

4869
02:27:30,590 --> 02:27:32,710
Oh my god, that was so hot.

4870
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:33,910
Holy shit!

4871
02:27:34,170 --> 02:27:34,850
We got two!

4872
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:38,950
Yeah, it definitely killed everybody.

4873
02:27:40,470 --> 02:27:41,830
You killed yourself.

4874
02:27:42,170 --> 02:27:43,290
I told you beforehand.

4875
02:27:45,390 --> 02:27:46,830
Look, look how many I killed!

4876
02:27:47,790 --> 02:27:48,650
Look at you go!

4877
02:27:50,170 --> 02:27:54,350
Han was one of the people on the list.

4878
02:27:54,570 --> 02:27:55,950
I was behind cover too.

4879
02:27:55,950 --> 02:27:56,870
I got the big boy!

4880
02:28:00,290 --> 02:28:00,910
Oh no!

4881
02:28:01,810 --> 02:28:03,250
What the fuck was that for?

4882
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:03,570
I'm doing it!

4883
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:06,250
15 seconds!

4884
02:28:07,310 --> 02:28:07,730
15!

4885
02:28:08,210 --> 02:28:09,570
I got the anti-tank boy.

4886
02:28:10,370 --> 02:28:10,790
Nice.

4887
02:28:11,390 --> 02:28:13,910
TNT minus 10 seconds, clear landing zone.

4888
02:28:14,590 --> 02:28:15,530
Oh, where is it?

4889
02:28:15,630 --> 02:28:17,330
Oh, we're good, it's coming in 5 seconds!

4890
02:28:17,750 --> 02:28:19,050
I got the anti-tank boy!

4891
02:28:19,090 --> 02:28:20,190
Oh my goodness.

4892
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:24,730
The anti-tank boy is what exactly?

4893
02:28:25,070 --> 02:28:25,490
The anti-tank boy is what exactly?

4894
02:28:25,950 --> 02:28:27,870
The anti-tank is like one shot.

4895
02:28:29,090 --> 02:28:30,250
Just remove that.

4896
02:28:30,610 --> 02:28:30,990
Oh, the rocket?

4897
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:31,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4898
02:28:33,450 --> 02:28:35,450
Oh, it's coming down!

4899
02:28:35,530 --> 02:28:35,870
It's coming down!

4900
02:28:38,510 --> 02:28:39,590
Leave it to me!

4901
02:28:39,750 --> 02:28:40,450
Eagle strike!

4902
02:28:40,670 --> 02:28:41,250
Right on you!

4903
02:28:42,010 --> 02:28:43,850
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4904
02:28:43,850 --> 02:28:46,830
We have to get it if it's right on us.

4905
02:28:48,190 --> 02:28:49,490
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

4906
02:28:49,490 --> 02:28:50,410
No, no, no, no, no!

4907
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:52,190
I'm in!

4908
02:28:53,110 --> 02:28:55,390
Oh god, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running!

4909
02:28:55,990 --> 02:28:56,870
Not real!

4910
02:28:58,690 --> 02:28:59,930
I'm getting in, I'm getting in!

4911
02:29:00,010 --> 02:29:00,350
I'm getting in!

4912
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:03,290
Oh, we did it!

4913
02:29:05,530 --> 02:29:06,130
Let's go!

4914
02:29:06,990 --> 02:29:07,430
Yay!

4915
02:29:10,370 --> 02:29:12,610
Oh, easiest game of my life.

4916
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:16,450
I'm so stressed.

4917
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:20,290
You need to see that from my pubic.

4918
02:29:23,610 --> 02:29:25,330
I said, Eagle strike.

4919
02:29:26,370 --> 02:29:28,050
I got you bro, eagle strike.

4920
02:29:28,150 --> 02:29:30,970
And my whole screen turned red from the laser.

4921
02:29:33,390 --> 02:29:34,890
No, I was like, I got you, eagle strike!

4922
02:29:35,010 --> 02:29:35,770
On you, on you!

4923
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:41,810
Dude, my whole screen, because I was inside the red laser, my whole screen turned red.

4924
02:29:42,190 --> 02:29:43,190
That's when I died.

4925
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:47,930
Someone clip that, man.

4926
02:29:47,930 --> 02:29:51,970
I can't believe we successfully extracted, holy shit.

4927
02:29:52,310 --> 02:29:54,410
Someone clip that shit, please.

4928
02:29:54,570 --> 02:29:55,270
Holy fuck!

4929
02:29:55,610 --> 02:29:57,510
We actually did it!

4930
02:29:57,570 --> 02:30:00,830
We all got extracted for once.

4931
02:30:03,110 --> 02:30:04,350
Oh my god.

4932
02:30:05,670 --> 02:30:06,670
We did it!

4933
02:30:06,670 --> 02:30:07,230
That was so good.

4934
02:30:07,390 --> 02:30:10,390
We should LG on Bug Island.

4935
02:30:11,290 --> 02:30:12,290
Oh shit.

4936
02:30:12,290 --> 02:30:13,370
You wanna go back to bugs?

4937
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:15,670
Yes, we should LG on the bugs.

4938
02:30:16,070 --> 02:30:17,530
What LG means?

4939
02:30:17,570 --> 02:30:17,910
Last name.

4940
02:30:17,930 --> 02:30:19,210
Last game on the bugs.

4941
02:30:19,650 --> 02:30:20,590
Life is good.

4942
02:30:22,390 --> 02:30:23,230
We ended.

4943
02:30:23,250 --> 02:30:23,730
Oh my god.

4944
02:30:24,110 --> 02:30:25,650
Let's look at team damage real quick.

4945
02:30:26,030 --> 02:30:26,550
Alright.

4946
02:30:26,890 --> 02:30:30,530
I think we sort of know who has the most team damage.

4947
02:30:30,730 --> 02:30:32,050
Can you guys see my finger guns?

4948
02:30:32,770 --> 02:30:33,610
Heck yeah.

4949
02:30:35,190 --> 02:30:37,410
Trust me, not me this time.

4950
02:30:37,610 --> 02:30:38,290
Oh look!

4951
02:30:39,590 --> 02:30:40,150
Zero!

4952
02:30:40,830 --> 02:30:41,390
25!

4953
02:30:42,050 --> 02:30:42,470
What?

4954
02:30:42,810 --> 02:30:43,370
25?

4955
02:30:44,630 --> 02:30:45,190
Zero!

4956
02:30:45,490 --> 02:30:45,670
Zero!

4957
02:30:45,670 --> 02:30:47,170
Wait, how did you...

4958
02:30:48,570 --> 02:30:50,950
So I told you it wasn't me, RPR!

4959
02:30:51,230 --> 02:30:52,590
It said you killed me.

4960
02:30:52,830 --> 02:30:54,650
No, it's a zero friendly fire!

4961
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:55,830
I regret nothing.

4962
02:30:56,110 --> 02:30:56,870
It can't be me!

4963
02:30:57,070 --> 02:30:57,950
It's a zero friendly fire!

4964
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:59,170
I saw you shoot the rocket.

4965
02:31:00,650 --> 02:31:02,290
Yeah, but it didn't hit anybody.

4966
02:31:02,850 --> 02:31:04,270
It hit me in the face.

4967
02:31:05,810 --> 02:31:07,790
Are you trying to say stats are lying?

4968
02:31:08,970 --> 02:31:12,090
Are you trying to say the stats are lying?

4969
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:13,610
Yes.

4970
02:31:14,390 --> 02:31:14,870
Whoa.

4971
02:31:16,690 --> 02:31:17,530
I'm gonna go.

4972
02:31:17,930 --> 02:31:19,230
I'm gonna be a medic now.

4973
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:21,250
A medic?

4974
02:31:22,130 --> 02:31:23,430
That's gonna be fucking funny.

4975
02:31:23,690 --> 02:31:25,310
Yeah, I'll have six teams.

4976
02:31:27,850 --> 02:31:30,430
Wait, it's not a medic if you heal yourself.

4977
02:31:31,070 --> 02:31:31,550
It's not a medic if you heal yourself.

4978
02:31:31,550 --> 02:31:33,150
I'm a medic for me, not for you guys.

4979
02:31:35,510 --> 02:31:38,090
Seller, did you buy the bow pass stuff?

4980
02:31:38,370 --> 02:31:39,790
You didn't customize your items.

4981
02:31:40,750 --> 02:31:41,450
Press R.

4982
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:45,410
Go to R and then go to click the war button.

4983
02:31:45,570 --> 02:31:46,430
The first thing you see.

4984
02:31:47,970 --> 02:31:48,410
Yeah.

4985
02:31:48,410 --> 02:31:49,970
And then you just unlock it.

4986
02:31:51,490 --> 02:31:51,930
Okay.

4987
02:31:52,690 --> 02:31:54,230
Yeah, you can get new health meds.

4988
02:31:56,770 --> 02:31:58,510
How do I equip it on, though?

4989
02:31:58,670 --> 02:31:59,610
I look so cool.

4990
02:31:59,610 --> 02:32:01,310
If you unlock it, there's like an equip button.

4991
02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:03,950
Oh, they look all so ugly.

4992
02:32:04,030 --> 02:32:04,610
It's fine.

4993
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:07,990
Oh, shit, you're full orange.

4994
02:32:07,990 --> 02:32:09,370
Oh my god, Dok, you look terrible.

4995
02:32:09,910 --> 02:32:10,630
What do you mean?

4996
02:32:10,750 --> 02:32:11,490
I'm orange.

4997
02:32:12,370 --> 02:32:13,170
Yo, nice cape.

4998
02:32:13,350 --> 02:32:14,390
Yeah, look at my cape.

4999
02:32:14,390 --> 02:32:14,890
Woo!

5000
02:32:15,910 --> 02:32:18,010
Alright, let's go to Erato Prime.

5001
02:32:19,010 --> 02:32:19,450
Nice.

5002
02:32:19,470 --> 02:32:20,530
Wait, we can now play on extreme.

5003
02:32:21,370 --> 02:32:22,250
Oh no!

5004
02:32:24,870 --> 02:32:26,230
Maybe we shouldn't.

5005
02:32:27,390 --> 02:32:28,970
What can go wrong with me?

5006
02:32:28,970 --> 02:32:30,750
Isn't extreme bugs the one with the big one?

5007
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:32,850
They're all pretty big.

5008
02:32:32,890 --> 02:32:33,570
What do you mean?

5009
02:32:33,930 --> 02:32:35,070
Oh, you haven't seen big.

5010
02:32:35,250 --> 02:32:35,770
Oh, what?

5011
02:32:37,410 --> 02:32:38,390
It's a big bug.

5012
02:32:39,270 --> 02:32:40,870
The double B big bug.

5013
02:32:42,490 --> 02:32:43,090
Alright.

5014
02:32:44,370 --> 02:32:45,390
Oh, gee.

5015
02:32:46,030 --> 02:32:48,850
The eagle strike on your ass is...

5016
02:32:50,170 --> 02:32:51,090
The eagle strike on your ass is...

5017
02:32:51,090 --> 02:32:52,630
the perfect callout you could have done there.

5018
02:32:52,750 --> 02:32:53,170
Actually.

5019
02:32:54,150 --> 02:32:55,990
It was literally inside of me.

5020
02:32:59,970 --> 02:33:01,650
My whole screen turned red.

5021
02:33:01,710 --> 02:33:02,030
My whole screen turned red.

5022
02:33:02,030 --> 02:33:02,690
It's crazy.

5023
02:33:03,950 --> 02:33:05,930
Woah, where are you going?

5024
02:33:06,310 --> 02:33:08,370
Woah, you look so dusty.

5025
02:33:08,390 --> 02:33:10,030
I got my eagle strike.

5026
02:33:10,270 --> 02:33:10,450
I got my eagle strike.

5027
02:33:11,470 --> 02:33:11,870
My...

5028
02:33:12,770 --> 02:33:13,170
Alright.

5029
02:33:14,290 --> 02:33:14,690
Readied.

5030
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:17,990
I got everything I need.

5031
02:33:18,330 --> 02:33:19,690
Ooh, vitality ready up.

5032
02:33:20,030 --> 02:33:20,430
Alright.

5033
02:33:23,830 --> 02:33:24,990
Did you put the help on one?

5034
02:33:25,170 --> 02:33:25,790
I forgot.

5035
02:33:27,790 --> 02:33:28,970
We don't need it.

5036
02:33:29,110 --> 02:33:30,790
It's not like we're on extreme or anything.

5037
02:33:31,890 --> 02:33:32,290
Right?

5038
02:33:32,330 --> 02:33:34,390
I kind of panicked because everybody else was ready.

5039
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:35,930
And I was the only one who wasn't ready.

5040
02:33:36,010 --> 02:33:38,250
So I clicked ready because I wanted to get people to wait.

5041
02:33:38,450 --> 02:33:39,330
It's okay, Han.

5042
02:33:39,350 --> 02:33:40,850
We'll just go with this whole plan.

5043
02:33:40,870 --> 02:33:42,630
We'll just run into half of the ammo that we're supposed to run.

5044
02:33:42,790 --> 02:33:43,270
Yeah.

5045
02:33:43,630 --> 02:33:44,450
That'll be okay.

5046
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:47,450
I don't know.

5047
02:33:47,630 --> 02:33:50,110
Oh, it's the holes one.

5048
02:33:51,350 --> 02:33:53,290
Oh, why do we spawn in front of people?

5049
02:33:53,950 --> 02:33:54,430
Oh.

5050
02:33:55,590 --> 02:33:56,070
Woah.

5051
02:33:56,650 --> 02:33:57,130
No.

5052
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:01,160
Oh god.

5053
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:03,660
There's a big one right behind us.

5054
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:05,540
That's an interesting spawn.

5055
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:07,180
Oh god.

5056
02:34:10,420 --> 02:34:11,420
He's still alive.

5057
02:34:12,780 --> 02:34:13,480
I'm nading.

5058
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:16,340
Oh my god.

5059
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:17,380
His ass is on fire.

5060
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:18,400
Oh god.

5061
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:21,880
Okay, I'm going to spawn in a machine gun real fast.

5062
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:23,920
That's a wonderful idea.

5063
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:24,600
He died.

5064
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:26,260
Yep, I killed him.

5065
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:27,740
Okay.

5066
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:29,800
Wait, I just...

5067
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:30,140
There's another one.

5068
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:32,220
Yeah, I'll deal with him.

5069
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:33,820
Grabbing my machine gun.

5070
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:35,880
Got it.

5071
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:39,800
Show your butt.

5072
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:40,560
Show your ass.

5073
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:42,240
Nice.

5074
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:44,340
Okay.

5075
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:45,400
I'm gonna...

5076
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:46,820
I'm gonna fucking...

5077
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:49,320
Order in a machine gun as well.

5078
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:49,740
Oh.

5079
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:51,180
One second.

5080
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:51,700
One second.

5081
02:34:52,060 --> 02:34:54,920
Wait, nade this thing?

5082
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:55,540
I'll nade it.

5083
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:55,960
I'll nade it.

5084
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:56,100
Move.

5085
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:57,400
Wait, nade what?

5086
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:58,960
I'm nading this door.

5087
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:00,460
There's a door?

5088
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:03,240
Oh, there is a door.

5089
02:35:04,260 --> 02:35:05,580
There's a flamethrower in here.

5090
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:06,140
Oh no.

5091
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:11,060
Except for...

5092
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:13,660
It's good that there's two of them using it.

5093
02:35:13,740 --> 02:35:14,220
But yeah, it's great.

5094
02:35:14,460 --> 02:35:15,700
No, I'm not using it.

5095
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:16,380
It's Doki.

5096
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:17,680
So I'm fine.

5097
02:35:18,740 --> 02:35:20,700
You know, she's got that POV.

5098
02:35:20,940 --> 02:35:23,120
You or Doki using it is still not good.

5099
02:35:23,460 --> 02:35:23,980
What do you mean?

5100
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:24,980
It's content.

5101
02:35:25,300 --> 02:35:26,080
Look at this.

5102
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:28,860
It's definitely content.

5103
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:30,760
It's not good though.

5104
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:32,180
Look, I did it.

5105
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:33,460
Let's go.

5106
02:35:35,660 --> 02:35:37,540
Oh no, there's a stalker nest.

5107
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:38,740
Oh, don't worry.

5108
02:35:38,820 --> 02:35:39,360
I have flamethrower.

5109
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:41,020
I'm heading over.

5110
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:42,360
Yeah, run into that nest.

5111
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:43,160
Come on, go, go, go.

5112
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:46,940
I gotta delete that stalker nest or we're gonna die.

5113
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:47,980
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go.

5114
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:49,360
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

5115
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:50,440
Fire is coming.

5116
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:53,460
Don't worry.

5117
02:35:55,060 --> 02:35:56,000
I'm coming over.

5118
02:35:56,780 --> 02:35:57,620
Where's the second son?

5119
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:59,380
Yeah, where's the second son?

5120
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:02,220
How many sons do you have?

5121
02:36:02,340 --> 02:36:02,640
What?

5122
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:04,120
What?

5123
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:07,520
Oh, big man coming from the back.

5124
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:08,020
Oh, shit.

5125
02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:12,080
Where is that?

5126
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:13,120
Right behind us.

5127
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:14,160
Oh, shit.

5128
02:36:14,260 --> 02:36:14,900
Oh, you're right.

5129
02:36:15,020 --> 02:36:15,900
Oh, fuck.

5130
02:36:16,040 --> 02:36:16,960
He's tanky.

5131
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:20,200
Let's just lead him over to RPR.

5132
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:21,120
We lead him over to RPR.

5133
02:36:21,880 --> 02:36:22,480
That's the plan.

5134
02:36:22,660 --> 02:36:23,960
Oh, my god.

5135
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:26,060
Holy shit.

5136
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:27,240
I'm shooting him in the ass.

5137
02:36:27,300 --> 02:36:27,960
I'm fucking him in the ass.

5138
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:29,780
He's looking at me.

5139
02:36:30,280 --> 02:36:31,180
He's looking at me.

5140
02:36:31,440 --> 02:36:32,420
Ah, fuck.

5141
02:36:34,980 --> 02:36:36,280
Okay, I was...

5142
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:37,180
You did it.

5143
02:36:37,260 --> 02:36:37,500
You did it.

5144
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:38,240
You did it, Zoe.

5145
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:39,340
I was a distraction.

5146
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:42,640
But I got him though, didn't I?

5147
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:43,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5148
02:36:43,560 --> 02:36:43,920
It's good.

5149
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:44,600
I was a distraction.

5150
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:46,140
I'm...

5151
02:36:46,820 --> 02:36:48,300
I'm killing these small ones.

5152
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:50,380
It's a big boy!

5153
02:36:51,620 --> 02:36:53,020
Why can I not...

5154
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:54,680
destroy this local rail?

5155
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:55,940
Or layer?

5156
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:57,180
No!

5157
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:00,960
You got any nades, boys?

5158
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:01,800
I'm okay.

5159
02:37:02,220 --> 02:37:03,160
No, I'm not.

5160
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:04,080
I am not okay.

5161
02:37:04,300 --> 02:37:06,080
I am not okay right now.

5162
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:07,240
Okay.

5163
02:37:07,820 --> 02:37:08,340
Please.

5164
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:09,200
Somebody!

5165
02:37:10,100 --> 02:37:11,460
I can't see you!

5166
02:37:11,660 --> 02:37:13,880
I just saw her die in her own flame cover.

5167
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:16,780
There was like six of them!

5168
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:18,040
There was like six of them!

5169
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:19,640
There's a bio-titan over where I was.

5170
02:37:20,900 --> 02:37:22,140
There's a bio-titan?

5171
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:22,400
There's a bio-titan?

5172
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:22,720
Yeah.

5173
02:37:23,580 --> 02:37:25,440
Zalurza, pick up my flame flower!

5174
02:37:25,660 --> 02:37:26,440
Pick it up!

5175
02:37:28,360 --> 02:37:30,400
I am... I am getting fucked!

5176
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:33,160
I am...

5177
02:37:33,160 --> 02:37:33,160
I am getting fucked!

5178
02:37:33,160 --> 02:37:34,840
Wait, am I landing on my flame flower?

5179
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:37,500
Wait, am I landing on my flame flower?

5180
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:38,280
Yeah!

5181
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:39,700
Pick it up yourself!

5182
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:41,500
Okay, I got it.

5183
02:37:42,220 --> 02:37:42,980
Nice, nice, nice.

5184
02:37:43,420 --> 02:37:45,380
Wait, where is it?

5185
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:47,360
We gotta close more terminate holes.

5186
02:37:47,880 --> 02:37:48,820
Where's my flame flower?

5187
02:37:49,660 --> 02:37:50,720
It's behind you somewhere.

5188
02:37:51,540 --> 02:37:52,860
Did you take it?

5189
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:54,900
Nope, I have a railgun.

5190
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:56,420
Oh, I have it!

5191
02:37:59,780 --> 02:38:03,500
We are actually in a desert and we can't see shit.

5192
02:38:03,580 --> 02:38:04,280
We can't see shit.

5193
02:38:04,420 --> 02:38:06,100
Oh, yeah, this is a terrible map.

5194
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:07,980
Holy moly.

5195
02:38:07,980 --> 02:38:09,520
This is what driving with an astigmatism looks like.

5196
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:11,340
Wait, there's mosquitos too?

5197
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:13,920
Oh, don't get bit by one of them.

5198
02:38:13,980 --> 02:38:15,720
You're gonna die if you get bit by one over here.

5199
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:20,280
Yeah, I don't think they have cures for whatever disease they have here.

5200
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:22,440
I don't know how many nades.

5201
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:23,720
Can you roll the shit up?

5202
02:38:23,960 --> 02:38:24,540
Yeah, I have.

5203
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:25,480
I spawned in.

5204
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:27,940
Oh my god, I got...

5205
02:38:27,940 --> 02:38:28,440
AHHHHH!

5206
02:38:30,120 --> 02:38:30,520
Nice.

5207
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:34,040
Thanks, guys.

5208
02:38:34,460 --> 02:38:35,820
I got the anti-tank kill.

5209
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:36,960
Fast travel.

5210
02:38:37,060 --> 02:38:38,140
Okay, more holes here.

5211
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:42,780
Oh, it just blocked it, I think.

5212
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:44,860
Nice.

5213
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:45,060
Nice.

5214
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:46,780
Woah, woah, woah.

5215
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:48,620
I'm reloading.

5216
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:50,720
There's one behind you, Han.

5217
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:52,260
There's three behind us.

5218
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:52,720
Behind us.

5219
02:38:56,440 --> 02:38:57,600
Oh, it's this thing.

5220
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:57,960
I'm coming.

5221
02:38:58,660 --> 02:39:00,540
There's a giant mushroom.

5222
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:05,100
Wait, what the fuck is this fire-spitting shit?

5223
02:39:05,240 --> 02:39:05,900
I got the spore.

5224
02:39:06,100 --> 02:39:06,520
I got the spore.

5225
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:07,480
I did!

5226
02:39:09,660 --> 02:39:10,060
Okay.

5227
02:39:10,300 --> 02:39:11,620
I need a resupply soon.

5228
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:12,640
I'm running out of flames.

5229
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:14,520
No.

5230
02:39:16,620 --> 02:39:18,140
We'll let her have a fucking...

5231
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:18,920
Yes, thank you!

5232
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:19,540
I got you!

5233
02:39:19,620 --> 02:39:19,880
Nice flame.

5234
02:39:21,880 --> 02:39:23,100
It's not burning alive.

5235
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:24,080
I can hear it breathing.

5236
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:25,460
Yeah, I can hear it.

5237
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:26,820
I hate the community.

5238
02:39:26,820 --> 02:39:27,420
Don't worry about it.

5239
02:39:28,380 --> 02:39:29,660
That wasn't my fault.

5240
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:31,920
I can't hit this guy's leg, bro.

5241
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:33,260
It's okay, I can just burn it.

5242
02:39:34,820 --> 02:39:36,160
I can just burn it.

5243
02:39:36,460 --> 02:39:36,860
I can just burn it.

5244
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:38,600
Oh my god, he hates me.

5245
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:40,020
Okay, I don't have flames.

5246
02:39:40,120 --> 02:39:41,040
I'm gonna call a resupply.

5247
02:39:41,560 --> 02:39:43,500
I got it with the anti-tank killer.

5248
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:43,960
Nice, nice, nice.

5249
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:45,980
You didn't kill him.

5250
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:47,180
Well, nearly.

5251
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:48,820
Just got rid of his shield.

5252
02:39:48,940 --> 02:39:49,560
I got another one.

5253
02:39:49,860 --> 02:39:51,440
Don't worry, we have another anti-tank.

5254
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:52,420
Fuck!

5255
02:39:54,620 --> 02:39:55,280
Okay, he's dead.

5256
02:39:55,380 --> 02:39:55,680
Nice.

5257
02:39:58,780 --> 02:40:00,420
I got more flames.

5258
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:04,700
I'm good.

5259
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:06,240
Nice, nice, nice.

5260
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:09,940
Alright, where do we go?

5261
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:13,180
Five more minutes to get like...

5262
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:14,780
Four more... wait.

5263
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:15,820
Five more.

5264
02:40:17,140 --> 02:40:18,400
Oh my god, too many symbols.

5265
02:40:19,160 --> 02:40:19,580
Math?

5266
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:20,140
Math?

5267
02:40:20,140 --> 02:40:21,660
Yes, addition is really hard.

5268
02:40:22,300 --> 02:40:23,200
Okay, I'll split up.

5269
02:40:23,740 --> 02:40:24,960
I'm getting rest.

5270
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:26,500
I'm...

5271
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:30,100
Zeller and I are coming over to RPR because we think he needs the most help.

5272
02:40:30,220 --> 02:40:30,400
Okay.

5273
02:40:30,860 --> 02:40:31,480
Yeah, yeah.

5274
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:34,540
Han Solo doesn't need mine.

5275
02:40:34,940 --> 02:40:35,940
I can handle this.

5276
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:37,180
That's my name, baby.

5277
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:40,900
Yeah, that's why he's Han Solo and RPR is R2-D2.

5278
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:44,100
He needs more than two people with him.

5279
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:44,440
He needs more than two people with him.

5280
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:45,400
Yeah, that's why there's the two.

5281
02:40:46,060 --> 02:40:48,360
The only thing I need from you guys is your guys' nades.

5282
02:40:48,420 --> 02:40:49,020
Because I'm out of nades.

5283
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:50,460
Leave it to me!

5284
02:40:50,980 --> 02:40:54,140
Throw them in the orange holes.

5285
02:40:54,400 --> 02:40:55,440
Oh, this one here?

5286
02:40:55,900 --> 02:40:56,640
Yeah, yeah.

5287
02:40:56,680 --> 02:40:57,780
That one and this one next to me.

5288
02:40:58,020 --> 02:40:58,820
Okay, I got you.

5289
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:01,500
Yeah, throw in that hole.

5290
02:41:01,820 --> 02:41:02,720
You got this, Zeller.

5291
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:03,360
Fire in the hole.

5292
02:41:03,580 --> 02:41:04,300
And this one here.

5293
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:05,780
I got this one.

5294
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:07,240
Fire in the hole.

5295
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:10,540
We did it!

5296
02:41:11,500 --> 02:41:12,500
We need one more.

5297
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,500
Han, you got that last one?

5298
02:41:15,180 --> 02:41:15,980
I'm going for it.

5299
02:41:21,160 --> 02:41:22,320
Okay, that was easy.

5300
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:23,060
We had bugs.

5301
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:24,240
Yeah, I know, right?

5302
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:25,700
Nothing against us humans.

5303
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:31,320
After the robot orientation missions, this is so easy now.

5304
02:41:31,580 --> 02:41:32,020
Hell yeah.

5305
02:41:33,340 --> 02:41:33,860
Yeah!

5306
02:41:35,540 --> 02:41:40,520
You guys haven't met a hive queen yet, have you?

5307
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:41,160
No.

5308
02:41:41,300 --> 02:41:42,560
Is there a hive queen here?

5309
02:41:42,820 --> 02:41:44,880
Oh, is it that little slug looking bitch?

5310
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:46,340
No, it's a four.

5311
02:41:46,480 --> 02:41:48,620
It's like a massive bug.

5312
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:50,560
Well, they're all bugs.

5313
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:51,240
It's gigantic.

5314
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:52,980
Yeah, they're all bugs.

5315
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:55,380
It's like gigantic, though.

5316
02:41:55,700 --> 02:41:57,200
Wait, is there a hive queen in this map?

5317
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:00,620
I don't know if one of them will spawn here.

5318
02:42:01,140 --> 02:42:02,180
Let's go kill her then.

5319
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:02,460
Easy.

5320
02:42:02,660 --> 02:42:03,080
Yeah, let's kill her.

5321
02:42:03,100 --> 02:42:04,440
I don't know if it will spawn in this difficulty.

5322
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:07,060
Hey, more holes here if you guys have nades.

5323
02:42:07,420 --> 02:42:07,780
Alright.

5324
02:42:08,420 --> 02:42:09,980
Oh, there's flying ones.

5325
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:10,620
They're coming over.

5326
02:42:13,100 --> 02:42:14,460
Oh, there's a lot of holes here.

5327
02:42:15,800 --> 02:42:17,020
And a lot of big guys.

5328
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:17,840
Guys, no!

5329
02:42:18,340 --> 02:42:19,640
They're all getting up!

5330
02:42:19,640 --> 02:42:20,040
Oh no.

5331
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:21,680
Guys, it's okay.

5332
02:42:21,940 --> 02:42:22,380
Oh, she died.

5333
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:25,700
So I can grab my flamethrower.

5334
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:28,120
Han died?

5335
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:29,960
Yep, I sacrificed myself.

5336
02:42:30,500 --> 02:42:31,020
It's alright.

5337
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:33,840
You wanted to die so you're closer to us when we extraction.

5338
02:42:34,460 --> 02:42:35,120
Pretty much.

5339
02:42:35,440 --> 02:42:36,860
Death only brings us closer.

5340
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:37,600
Exactly!

5341
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:38,640
Yeah!

5342
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:41,520
War brings us closer.

5343
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:45,880
Are we coming in now?

5344
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:46,100
Okay!

5345
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:47,800
Where's the big guys?

5346
02:42:47,900 --> 02:42:48,620
They probably spawned you.

5347
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:49,760
Nice.

5348
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:51,020
Okay, I'm gonna land on them.

5349
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:53,220
Oh, I squished one.

5350
02:42:54,980 --> 02:42:56,200
Wait, I'm gonna throw one.

5351
02:42:56,420 --> 02:42:57,140
Can you guys plug roles?

5352
02:42:57,380 --> 02:42:58,200
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

5353
02:42:58,340 --> 02:42:59,440
Where's my flamethrower?

5354
02:43:01,340 --> 02:43:01,740
Samples?

5355
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:03,800
Nice, nice, nice.

5356
02:43:05,820 --> 02:43:07,460
Where the fuck is my flamethrower?

5357
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:09,900
You have two minutes, so it's probably good then.

5358
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:11,000
Yep, let's go, let's go.

5359
02:43:11,720 --> 02:43:13,060
North, east, north, east.

5360
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:13,520
Punisher.

5361
02:43:13,740 --> 02:43:14,340
Oh, there you go.

5362
02:43:15,100 --> 02:43:15,820
We're heading over.

5363
02:43:16,700 --> 02:43:17,960
I have no more stims.

5364
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:20,640
I have two stims.

5365
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:21,120
I'm running over.

5366
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:24,080
Calling down a sentry!

5367
02:43:24,660 --> 02:43:25,020
Okay.

5368
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:27,120
Oh no, I just saw a big guy spawn.

5369
02:43:27,460 --> 02:43:27,520
I'm throwing an E.T.

5370
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:27,740
guys.

5371
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:31,380
I'm way behind you guys, but I'm coming over.

5372
02:43:32,580 --> 02:43:33,600
Alright, we'll look for you.

5373
02:43:34,340 --> 02:43:35,800
Oh, there's a big guy right after you!

5374
02:43:35,820 --> 02:43:36,520
Maybe I won't look for you.

5375
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:37,580
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

5376
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:37,940
Oh fuck!

5377
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,960
If you walk over here, I'll get rid of him.

5378
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:44,140
Guys, he's like blocking me.

5379
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:46,840
It's okay.

5380
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,200
Come up here, come up here.

5381
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:50,240
I need them coming over.

5382
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:51,360
No, the eagle!

5383
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:53,660
You threw a nade on her.

5384
02:43:56,320 --> 02:43:57,880
This is the wall of fire.

5385
02:43:57,960 --> 02:43:59,040
Now they can't come over, see?

5386
02:43:59,220 --> 02:43:59,580
I'm okay.

5387
02:43:59,980 --> 02:44:01,400
I planned that, I planned that.

5388
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:03,660
Now they're all getting burned.

5389
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:05,660
No, no, no, no, no.

5390
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:08,100
Nothing bad happened to me.

5391
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:08,940
I'm okay.

5392
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:11,680
I don't think we got it in time.

5393
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:15,060
Han, there's a lot of red X's.

5394
02:44:15,980 --> 02:44:16,380
Alright.

5395
02:44:17,960 --> 02:44:18,680
Oh, there's some coming over now.

5396
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:19,140
Can you call a resupply?

5397
02:44:19,340 --> 02:44:20,540
I'm out of ammo, basically.

5398
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:23,540
Thank you.

5399
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:25,040
Alright, I'm gonna throw a gatling.

5400
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:26,600
Up, up, up.

5401
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:27,640
Oh my god.

5402
02:44:28,120 --> 02:44:29,220
They're doing their part.

5403
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:31,020
We're all doing our part.

5404
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:34,700
I threw my gatling in.

5405
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,660
Fuck, this guy's so tanky.

5406
02:44:36,660 --> 02:44:38,680
He's like...

5407
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:40,920
Oh, that's a big guy.

5408
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:42,180
Big guy's over to your left.

5409
02:44:43,060 --> 02:44:44,440
I killed one of the...

5410
02:44:44,860 --> 02:44:46,100
Fuck, this guy's so tanky.

5411
02:44:46,260 --> 02:44:47,640
I'm gonna try and get the flying ones.

5412
02:44:49,420 --> 02:44:50,140
Where's the big guy?

5413
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:52,020
Big guy is down.

5414
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:52,660
Big guy's down.

5415
02:44:53,480 --> 02:44:54,440
Oh no, nevermind.

5416
02:44:54,540 --> 02:44:55,360
There's another big guy.

5417
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:57,360
He's dead.

5418
02:44:57,700 --> 02:44:58,360
I'm stuck.

5419
02:44:58,820 --> 02:44:59,540
I'm flamethrowing.

5420
02:45:02,220 --> 02:45:02,700
It's okay.

5421
02:45:02,940 --> 02:45:03,360
We're good.

5422
02:45:03,420 --> 02:45:03,660
We're good.

5423
02:45:03,700 --> 02:45:03,960
We're good.

5424
02:45:05,280 --> 02:45:05,640
Reloading.

5425
02:45:05,640 --> 02:45:06,480
There's another big guy.

5426
02:45:06,500 --> 02:45:07,100
There's another big guy.

5427
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:07,580
Another big guy.

5428
02:45:07,620 --> 02:45:08,080
Another big guy.

5429
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:08,920
He's coming to me.

5430
02:45:09,660 --> 02:45:10,640
I'm shooting him in the van.

5431
02:45:10,660 --> 02:45:11,420
I'm shooting him in the van.

5432
02:45:11,420 --> 02:45:12,560
I'm shooting him.

5433
02:45:13,240 --> 02:45:14,420
He's burning.

5434
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:16,900
He's breathing.

5435
02:45:17,180 --> 02:45:18,320
He's burning.

5436
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:21,680
You hear the weirdest stuff.

5437
02:45:22,180 --> 02:45:22,680
Really?

5438
02:45:22,780 --> 02:45:23,480
Yeah.

5439
02:45:23,480 --> 02:45:24,000
Where are you from?

5440
02:45:24,380 --> 02:45:24,800
Oh, there's a Hive Queen.

5441
02:45:26,380 --> 02:45:27,840
Oh, this guy's massive.

5442
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:29,440
Wait, is that the Hive Queen?

5443
02:45:29,720 --> 02:45:30,420
Yes.

5444
02:45:32,320 --> 02:45:33,480
I'm reloading.

5445
02:45:33,560 --> 02:45:34,040
I'm reloading.

5446
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:37,740
Okay.

5447
02:45:39,360 --> 02:45:40,320
I reload.

5448
02:45:41,420 --> 02:45:42,000
Oh, what the...

5449
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:43,220
What?

5450
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:46,380
Oh, I...

5451
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:47,500
I killed her.

5452
02:45:47,740 --> 02:45:48,540
I killed her.

5453
02:45:48,620 --> 02:45:48,860
I killed her.

5454
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:51,040
Guys, I got stomped on.

5455
02:45:52,380 --> 02:45:52,940
Miles.

5456
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:54,640
I didn't...

5457
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:55,840
I killed her.

5458
02:45:56,380 --> 02:45:56,940
Nice.

5459
02:45:58,760 --> 02:46:00,600
Oh, these fucking...

5460
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:03,400
Small crabs ate me.

5461
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:05,060
I didn't know that.

5462
02:46:06,380 --> 02:46:07,580
We need to call them in.

5463
02:46:07,620 --> 02:46:08,620
But there's a lot on us.

5464
02:46:08,860 --> 02:46:10,300
The destroyer has left orbit.

5465
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:12,140
Bring us back.

5466
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:13,920
Shuttle to your shuttle tier.

5467
02:46:14,200 --> 02:46:15,420
Remember us.

5468
02:46:16,660 --> 02:46:19,020
Remember what we did for all of you.

5469
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:19,480
Don't forget about us.

5470
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:22,440
Are you good, hun?

5471
02:46:22,580 --> 02:46:24,640
Don't forget about us.

5472
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:25,440
I'm good.

5473
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:33,040
Oh, my lord.

5474
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:35,960
Oh, my god.

5475
02:46:36,420 --> 02:46:38,980
Just another day of work.

5476
02:46:38,980 --> 02:46:41,260
I can't believe we saw the Hive Queen.

5477
02:46:41,740 --> 02:46:44,400
We saw and I got stomped on it.

5478
02:46:44,420 --> 02:46:45,460
If I hit it.

5479
02:46:45,900 --> 02:46:47,420
It's actually called the Bile Titan.

5480
02:46:47,620 --> 02:46:49,500
But I keep calling her Hive Queen for some reason.

5481
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:51,700
I can't believe it.

5482
02:46:51,880 --> 02:46:52,960
It was an honor.

5483
02:46:53,300 --> 02:46:54,120
I shot like a cannon in her.

5484
02:46:54,500 --> 02:47:00,520
And then as soon as I finished shooting a cannon in her, there's like three little crab looking guys jumped on my ass.

5485
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:01,780
And I just blew and died.

5486
02:47:02,460 --> 02:47:04,560
How dare you cannon the queen.

5487
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:05,860
How dare you.

5488
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:08,960
They're like, aww, beyond me.

5489
02:47:08,980 --> 02:47:09,840
My queen.

5490
02:47:10,060 --> 02:47:12,080
My sacrifice was not in vain.

5491
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:14,240
Four stars.

5492
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:15,000
Woo!

5493
02:47:15,820 --> 02:47:16,400
Nice!

5494
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:20,220
That's almost like a five star.

5495
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:22,200
A mournful victory.

5496
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:24,040
Remember us.

5497
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:27,440
Look how many samples I got us.

5498
02:47:27,520 --> 02:47:28,120
Oh, my god.

5499
02:47:28,200 --> 02:47:28,800
I'm the king.

5500
02:47:28,840 --> 02:47:29,280
Holy crap.

5501
02:47:29,700 --> 02:47:30,600
Holy shit.

5502
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:34,180
I'm going around and collecting.

5503
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:36,920
Wait, did your badge update?

5504
02:47:37,060 --> 02:47:38,140
On the bottom left.

5505
02:47:39,160 --> 02:47:39,820
Yeah, it did.

5506
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:41,960
It's back to super citizen.

5507
02:47:45,220 --> 02:47:46,720
Why does it keep changing?

5508
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:50,400
It knows you're...

5509
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:52,500
Super citizen.

5510
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:54,560
Pay to win.

5511
02:47:55,320 --> 02:47:57,000
Dark Veedle looking ass.

5512
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:59,380
No friendly fire damage.

5513
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:01,380
Next one for him is going to be senior citizen.

5514
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:02,160
We did so good.

5515
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:03,240
We learned.

5516
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:05,520
We did it.

5517
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:07,620
We fired so many.

5518
02:48:08,980 --> 02:48:11,140
How are you guys not firing any shots?

5519
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:11,960
I don't get it.

5520
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:12,600
What the fuck?

5521
02:48:14,140 --> 02:48:16,260
Because I'm shooting big rockets.

5522
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:17,840
Because we're shooting to kill.

5523
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,100
Not shooting the floor.

5524
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:21,340
He's shooting big rockets.

5525
02:48:21,420 --> 02:48:22,640
You're only shooting small rockets.

5526
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:24,060
I'm shooting pellet guns.

5527
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:28,680
GG's guys.

5528
02:48:28,940 --> 02:48:29,580
I had fun.

5529
02:48:29,740 --> 02:48:30,580
That was so fun.

5530
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:33,440
I'm glad we...

5531
02:48:34,060 --> 02:48:35,700
Thanks for joining me.

5532
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:37,180
Thank you guys.

5533
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:38,300
I had a lot of fun.

5534
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:39,920
Doing our parts.

5535
02:48:40,260 --> 02:48:43,860
The favorite game we had for me was the first one.

5536
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:45,060
What do you mean?

5537
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:47,220
My favorite game was the...

5538
02:48:47,220 --> 02:48:48,720
The game before this.

5539
02:48:50,660 --> 02:48:51,180
Nah.

5540
02:48:51,320 --> 02:48:53,680
Seeing Zeller land on Han.

5541
02:48:53,780 --> 02:48:55,520
And then pick up his scarver cannon.

5542
02:48:55,660 --> 02:48:56,780
And shoot Docky in the ass.

5543
02:48:56,860 --> 02:48:58,840
Was 100% a highlight.

5544
02:48:58,920 --> 02:49:01,440
At the very beginning.

5545
02:49:01,880 --> 02:49:02,680
Just a double kill.

5546
02:49:02,840 --> 02:49:04,840
I landed on Zeller too.

5547
02:49:05,700 --> 02:49:07,380
One way I landed on Zeller.

5548
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:08,880
Right after you.

5549
02:49:14,700 --> 02:49:15,740
GG guys.

5550
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:16,740
GG.

5551
02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:19,480
I'm so happy to play Helldivers 2 with all of you.

5552
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:20,040
That was fun.

5553
02:49:20,280 --> 02:49:22,160
You guys are so fun with my squad.

5554
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:26,420
I know why you spent 10 hours on it last night.

5555
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:28,060
Holy shit.

5556
02:49:29,360 --> 02:49:30,560
Let's do it again sometime.

5557
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:32,500
Hell yeah for sure.

5558
02:49:33,540 --> 02:49:34,060
GG's.

5559
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:38,300
I'm gonna talk to my chat a little bit.

5560
02:49:38,380 --> 02:49:39,940
But thank you guys for joining.

5561
02:49:40,820 --> 02:49:41,840
Let's do this again.

5562
02:49:43,140 --> 02:49:44,100
Salute to the captain.

5563
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:45,200
Wait captain.

5564
02:49:45,280 --> 02:49:47,120
This is my ship.

5565
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:48,800
Stop left.

5566
02:49:48,900 --> 02:49:49,920
This is operated by RPR.

5567
02:49:50,020 --> 02:49:50,720
I am the captain.

5568
02:49:52,360 --> 02:49:53,060
Aye aye captain.

5569
02:49:54,520 --> 02:49:55,840
Oh he left.

5570
02:49:57,140 --> 02:49:57,660
Alright.

5571
02:49:58,320 --> 02:49:59,080
See you guys.

5572
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:00,520
Bye bye.

5573
02:50:00,520 --> 02:50:00,960
Bye bye.

5574
02:50:01,360 --> 02:50:02,180
Bye bye.

5575
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:07,920
Let me swap real quick.

5576
02:50:08,320 --> 02:50:09,300
Oh my god.

5577
02:50:09,340 --> 02:50:09,800
Oh shit.

5578
02:50:09,860 --> 02:50:10,420
Oh no.

5579
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:11,480
Leaks.

5580
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:15,560
Oh no.

5581
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:16,360
Member leaks.

5582
02:50:20,540 --> 02:50:22,540
I forgot to hide that.

5583
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:23,220
Sorry guys.

5584
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:25,340
Sorry guys.

5585
02:50:25,460 --> 02:50:29,800
A little bit of a sneak peek for the charity auction.

5586
02:50:29,980 --> 02:50:30,500
I'm sorry.

5587
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:30,880
For...

5588
02:50:32,230 --> 02:50:32,560
Saturday.

5589
02:50:35,020 --> 02:50:35,680
Um...

5590
02:50:36,230 --> 02:50:36,560
Um...

5591
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:38,140
That was really fun.

5592
02:50:38,660 --> 02:50:39,540
That was so fun.

5593
02:50:39,640 --> 02:50:43,640
I'm really happy to be able to play with Hans, Zelian, RPR today.

5594
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:45,480
And uh...

5595
02:50:45,480 --> 02:50:47,700
It has been a joy.

5596
02:50:47,820 --> 02:50:49,280
To play with the three.

5597
02:50:50,040 --> 02:50:50,700
Um...

5598
02:50:50,700 --> 02:50:53,080
Play with some new friends today.

5599
02:50:54,220 --> 02:50:56,060
Sorry to the ones...

5600
02:50:56,060 --> 02:50:58,180
For the people in NA.

5601
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:23,460
Thank you all for the superchats!

5602
02:51:23,700 --> 02:51:24,400
Holy shit!

5603
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:25,980
Affiliate, thank you for the magenta soup!

5604
02:51:26,040 --> 02:51:27,120
Thank you, thank you!

5605
02:51:27,260 --> 02:51:29,300
This group was so fun.

5606
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:31,400
Hope you guys get to collab more in the future.

5607
02:51:31,460 --> 02:51:31,980
I hope so too!

5608
02:51:32,380 --> 02:51:33,240
I hope so too.

5609
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:34,760
I definitely had a great time.

5610
02:51:34,960 --> 02:51:36,100
Thank you again for the magenta soup.

5611
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:37,600
Thank you, thank you!

5612
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:46,240
I can't believe Zeller spent like 200 plus dollars trying to get L-timers 2 to work.

5613
02:51:46,820 --> 02:51:48,340
Like, you guys don't understand.

5614
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:50,380
It was so funny because like...

5615
02:51:51,880 --> 02:51:54,600
He couldn't get it to work on the first account.

5616
02:51:54,900 --> 02:51:58,160
So we're like, just make a new account and do like family share.

5617
02:51:58,360 --> 02:52:01,580
And then it didn't work because it's like region locked.

5618
02:52:01,860 --> 02:52:07,100
So then we're like, okay, buy like buy steam gift card.

5619
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:10,700
And then he couldn't buy steam gift card and add it on.

5620
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:15,580
And it didn't work because like for some reason he tried multiple times to purchase it.

5621
02:52:15,660 --> 02:52:17,340
And then the account got locked.

5622
02:52:17,580 --> 02:52:19,880
So then we're like, okay, Han.

5623
02:52:19,880 --> 02:52:23,740
You buy the game for him.

5624
02:52:23,880 --> 02:52:27,540
And then give the account to Zeller.

5625
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:28,820
And it worked.

5626
02:52:29,980 --> 02:52:31,040
Holy shit.

5627
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:32,400
Oh my god.

5628
02:52:32,520 --> 02:52:34,960
It was like a lot of back and forth.

5629
02:52:35,240 --> 02:52:36,220
It was so funny.

5630
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:37,940
But yeah, everybody.

5631
02:52:38,100 --> 02:52:39,520
I'm gonna rest now.

5632
02:52:39,960 --> 02:52:41,720
It's been a long, long day.

5633
02:52:41,960 --> 02:52:43,820
So I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

5634
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:46,480
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

5635
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:47,400
Posture check.

5636
02:52:47,500 --> 02:52:49,540
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5637
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:49,860
And then I'll see you guys in the next video.

5638
02:52:49,860 --> 02:52:49,860
Bye!

5639
02:52:49,880 --> 02:52:52,260
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

5640
02:52:52,460 --> 02:52:53,860
Because you deserve it.

5641
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:55,040
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5642
02:52:55,580 --> 02:52:56,340
Bye guys!

5643
02:52:56,840 --> 02:52:57,280
Bye!
