1
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,200
Hello, hello, I'm sorry.

2
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,980
We could have had... by the way, I'm compiling shaders, and that's why I'm lagging a little.

3
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,860
Oh, shader compiled!

4
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,980
Give me a sec, gotta... the game just compiled my shaders, guys.

5
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm so sorry.

6
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,600
I accidentally, I actually, I accidentally, uh...

7
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,680
I'm so stupid.

8
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,860
I've clicked delete.

9
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,040
I can't believe it.

10
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:35,380
I was trying to, I, I was like, alright, now that it's extracting, now that I've finished downloading it, I'm gonna go out, pour me some water, some, look how heavy this is.

11
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,240
That's how heavy this tumbler cup is, filled with water.

12
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,760
And I was like, I'm gonna, alright, let me put my water, my, my cup away, and then I hit escape.

13
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,260
My cup, as I hear how heavy this is, and then the cup hit escape button.

14
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,420
I, I missed.

15
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,500
I don't know how I missed.

16
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:19,880
I have a 60% keyboard, which is already a tiny keyboard, so like, I just have to put it to the left side of the keyboard, and then my cup, my, my cup hit the escape button, so I had to, I had to extract it again.

17
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,060
So yeah, that's why I'm a bit late.

18
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,040
Anyway, welcome everybody.

19
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,100
Welcome, welcome.

20
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:35,940
Today, um, I have early access to season two of Marvel Rivals.

21
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,940
If you guys didn't know, there is a lot of new updates coming.

22
00:03:39,940 --> 00:04:01,880
There's a lot of new updates with, uh, the new Marvel Rivals for season two, including the Dommie Mommie Emma Frost character, who so far seems incredibly broken from the stuff I've seen, and there's also a lot of other nerfs, a lot of other buffs.

23
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:12,820
I was told, um, by people who know more about this game than me, that Rocket got a huge buff for season two.

24
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,760
Yay.

25
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,080
I'm so looking forward to that buff.

26
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,420
Anyway, before, no, okay, I had a crash out yesterday.

27
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,260
I crashed out so hard yesterday.

28
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,380
Okay, so I, I wish I can show you the clip.

29
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:41,240
I fucking, okay, so I played Rivals yesterday night, because I was saying I could get the shiny new Top 500 badge.

30
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,560
It's the same size.

31
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,520
It's same size, which is above average.

32
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,680
The badge is still the same size, which is above average, but this time it sparkles.

33
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,460
It does a little shiny shine sparkle.

34
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,040
It's shiny now.

35
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:14,740
So, okay, yesterday night, I was playing some Rivals on my main, and I bumped into this enemy Rocket player.

36
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:26,880
Apparently, what I was told, I can't name names, but I was told that this player is also, like, a sort of a streamer, but, like, a lot of people don't like the streamer.

37
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:34,360
So, like, I was, like, really confused, because my team was, like, chit-talking this person, and they are a Rocket one trick.

38
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,480
And I was, like, okay, to be fair, they are a Rocket one trick, so I was, like, that's understandable.

39
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,260
But I was, like, why is there such an, like, a particular hate towards this streamer?

40
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,920
And then, um, they're, like, spectate her.

41
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,780
After this game, watch...

42
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:04,420
replay the match and watch in her POV.

43
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,520
So, I was, like, okay.

44
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,580
Let's see how bad could it be.

45
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,280
Also, their team, one of their teammates was, like, I can't believe...

46
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:25,080
This is the most times I've ever seen a Rocket player die, which is actually a compliment.

47
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:35,220
Like, I've never... I also checked it, and I was, like, man, I've never seen a Rocket player die that many times, because you have so many movement abilities to get away from everything.

48
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:45,800
So, um, anyway, uh, so, I spectated the match, and all... I need to give you... Okay, let me draw a visual.

49
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,300
I was crashing out.

50
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,360
I...

51
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,160
All right, okay.

52
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,740
Okay, I'm writing this, and then, like...

53
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,120
This is... Okay, so, I'm gonna draw the... I'm drawing this out right now.

54
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,240
So, there was a game.

55
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,700
We... Okay, my team obviously won, because, like, everyone was, like, roasting her.

56
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,120
But, like, I'm sorry.

57
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,640
I need to talk about this.

58
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:33,120
I was not okay, because I crashed out about this person to two different people, and then they're, like, you gotta talk about this on stream if you're, like, crashing out right now.

59
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,920
Like, you guys won, but you're still talking.

60
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,300
Okay, so, this is the visual.

61
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,720
She is on Rocket.

62
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:49,300
Her team is all the way over here, and she is all the way and so far away from her team.

63
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,760
Spamming right click.

64
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,520
She doesn't see what the fight is like.

65
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,940
I was, like...

66
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,080
The only thing she can see is, like, the silhouettes, and, like, I was, like...

67
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,220
We're... Why is she so far away?

68
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,120
There's no... She is not in any red spot.

69
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,240
She is just so far away.

70
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,680
No, she shoots, like, like the... She shoots around it.

71
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:38,560
She doesn't... I literally saw her team at one point got Groot ulted, and then walls were placed behind her team, and do you know what she does?

72
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,480
She shot at the wall.

73
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,560
She...

74
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,580
And she was... Nani, she was, like, behind it.

75
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,000
Just behind the wall, the Groot wall, and she shot at the wall.

76
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:03,120
But as Rocket, you can jump up and shoot down at your team, and I was, like, oh my god.

77
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,420
Why are you shooting at the wall?

78
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,680
I was... I was crashing out.

79
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:18,780
Like, I won, but I could not comprehend that this was a real person.

80
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,080
Like, this is how Rocket players play.

81
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:35,880
Like, this is how bad Rocket players play, but they're still in my elo, because she had 800 games played in total, and she's in my fucking elo.

82
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,740
She has 400 games on Rocket alone.

83
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,020
I... I was fucking going crazy.

84
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,040
For context, I have a hundred games on Luna.

85
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:11,560
And so, like, I... So, like, I was actually going fucking crazy last night.

86
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,100
I was, like, not okay.

87
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,280
And then, she's Eternity, and then, like, there was no movement.

88
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:28,240
She was 20 miles... She was either 20 miles away from her team, just right-click... I have... I did not see a single left-click.

89
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,340
I...

90
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,120
It was just mostly right-click.

91
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,080
I...

92
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:48,400
And, like... And then, knowing that's how bad Rocket players play, like, the bad Rocket one-tricks play... Because this is my problem with Rocket one-tricks.

93
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,380
They... A majority of them play like this.

94
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:58,080
Like, the good ones, they'll be, like, fucking jumping and, like, spider-manning everywhere, using their jetpacks everywhere.

95
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,020
Like, that's, like, good Rocket players.

96
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,560
And they're mostly not even Rocket one-tricks.

97
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,900
They're, like, Rocket... Like, they're, like, support mains that fill on Rocket when he's viable.

98
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,840
But, like, Rocket one... Majority of Rocket one-tricks play like this.

99
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:26,520
And then, I crashed out because you compare that gameplay with the shit I have to do daily on any other support character.

100
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,820
Like, I would get fucking died by Venom, harassed by a Magneto that walks up to me.

101
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,520
I have to hit 90% of my freezes to fucking survive.

102
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:47,020
I have to run around, do fucking snaps and shit as Loki, remembering my cooldown with my fucking lamps.

103
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360
I have to, like, place clones.

104
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,960
I have to snap, manage cooldowns, everything.

105
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,880
I even have to time my ults correctly.

106
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,320
You know what Rocket has to do?

107
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,640
He throws ult down wherever he wants and it's okay.

108
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:11,820
I... I have to be aware of my entire surrounding and make sure and then survive.

109
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:26,880
And then I see... I see this Rocket player 20 miles away from the team holding right click.

110
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:55,440
Actually, I wish I could show you... I wish I could show you the video of this particular Rocket gameplay, but the only way I could do it is if I censored the names because she actually sort of streams and I don't want to cause anything.

111
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,420
But oh my god, I... I... I... I don't know.

112
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,640
I... I don't know how you can, like, play like that.

113
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,980
I... I'm sorry.

114
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,220
Like, I don't know how...

115
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,220
First off, how do you not get bored?

116
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,840
Like, I just... I don't know how anyone can play like this.

117
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,760
She shot the Groot wall!

118
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:34,200
I just... I just... She watched her entire team just get Groot ulted, put behind a Groot wall, and she just shot the Groot... She healed!

119
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,740
She didn't shoot the Groot wall.

120
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,860
She healed the Groot wall.

121
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:47,600
She could have jumped, jetpacked up, and then shot her heels down, but she just right-clicked the Groot wall.

122
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:56,520
I don't... I... I just... I don't understand.

123
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,380
Anyway, I'm okay now.

124
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,120
I processed... Okay, I crashed out in the morning as well, but I processed everything.

125
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,120
I'm okay now.

126
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,620
I... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm as okay as I can be.

127
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,480
Anyway, Season 2 early access!

128
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:28,760
Um, um, I am looking forward to trying out all... Anyway, Rocket's getting buffed too, guys!

129
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,840
Yay!

130
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,740
I'm so excited!

131
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,300
I'm so fucking excited about that!

132
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,200
I forgot to like, put in my account information, guys.

133
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,480
I can't leak it real quick.

134
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,820
Give me a sec.

135
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,560
I need to... I need to put in my account information, guys.

136
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,620
Give me a sec.

137
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,720
I forgot about that part.

138
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,760
Oh my god.

139
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,120
Okay, it's okay.

140
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,360
I got this, guys.

141
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,540
Putting in my password.

142
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,520
This should take me in, right?

143
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,120
Okay, I'm okay.

144
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,880
I'm okay, guys.

145
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,380
I'm... I'm okay.

146
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,260
All right.

147
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,060
Okay, let's see.

148
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,460
How did someone already take my name?

149
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,880
What?

150
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,260
Someone actually already took my name!

151
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,800
This is early access!

152
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,080
How is that possible?

153
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,960
Okay, that's fine.

154
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,260
It's fine.

155
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,940
That's fine.

156
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,160
That's fine.

157
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,140
Some early access guy took my name.

158
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,100
I don't know how.

159
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,920
I don't know how that was possible, but that's okay.

160
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,640
That's okay.

161
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,280
That's okay.

162
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,700
Whoa, wait!

163
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,080
I really like the screen!

164
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,360
Okay, I like everything, but this...

165
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:05,640
Okay.

166
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,780
It's almost perfect, guys.

167
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,760
It's... it's almost perfect, guys.

168
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,480
It's almost there.

169
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,120
All right, so there is a new battle pass.

170
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,120
Let me check it out.

171
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,540
Okay.

172
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,380
So, oh!

173
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay, that's actually really sick.

174
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,520
Goddamn, Mike!

175
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,220
Thank you for the super chat!

176
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,760
Thank you, thank you.

177
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:51,220
All right, um... I mean, yeah, that's really... Why did... Okay, I feel like Spider-Man gets so many cool skins.

178
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,080
And then there's the X-Men skins for Psylocke.

179
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,480
I am not a fan of Nutcracker.

180
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,600
I saw that on Twitter.

181
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Not a big fan of it.

182
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,160
I don't know.

183
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,280
Maybe it's the hairstyle.

184
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,680
I think it's the hairstyle.

185
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:14,860
I know that's like a classic punk hairstyle, but like, it just looks so weird with Squirrel Girl, so I'm not like a huge fan.

186
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,700
I like everything else, but that.

187
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,460
The hair.

188
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,700
The hair just breaks it for me.

189
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,280
And apparently, like, the Psylocke...

190
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,920
Psylocke.

191
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:23,960
Magic.

192
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,320
Oh yeah, that looks really sick.

193
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,820
You know what this reminds me of?

194
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,180
Like, All Might from My Hero Academia.

195
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:29,860
Yeah.

196
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,680
This reminds me of My Hero Academia skin.

197
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,440
Like, I don't know.

198
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,820
It's just, like, the hair too.

199
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:51,160
Yeah, it looks just like... I thought that My Hero Academia got, like, a collaboration with Marvel Rivals when I first saw the skin.

200
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,120
And I realized, oh, it's supposed to be based off, like, the X-Men uniform and stuff.

201
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,600
I mean, this looks really sick.

202
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,520
I think this one looks really sick.

203
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,740
There's the Widowmaker skin.

204
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,440
And then, okay.

205
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:14,520
This might be the first Luna skin that I actually like.

206
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,140
This skin is actually really, really good.

207
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,900
I really like this skin.

208
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,040
All the other Luna skins are so fucking bad.

209
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,740
Like, you cannot convince me the other ones look good.

210
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,980
I think this one actually looks really good.

211
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,100
I like this design.

212
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,020
This might be the first Luna skin I actually buy.

213
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,380
Buy or, like, purchase with my free money.

214
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,740
Then there's the Joe Fix-It.

215
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,480
There's... I like Bruce.

216
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,820
I wish, like... I actually like the Bruce Banner form more than the Hulk form for this.

217
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,060
Uh, not a... I don't know.

218
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't really like the Hulk form for the Joe Fix-It skin.

219
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:05,360
I'd rather, like... I would want to play as just... as just Bruce Banner just for this skin.

220
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,980
Just, like, nothing... like, you're just in Bruce Banner form only.

221
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,160
Is there, like... where's the MVP?

222
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,840
I saw the MVP for the Bruce Banner was so sick, but I don't know where it is.

223
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,460
There's Captain America who looks like... Homelander right there.

224
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,840
Wolf looks like I'm going back to the Hellfire Gala.

225
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,960
And then there's... there's, um, Iron Fist skin.

226
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,400
Wait, is it on the page?

227
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,220
Wait, where is it?

228
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,680
Is it this one?

229
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,040
No, that's... wait, where is it?

230
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,900
Guys?

231
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,560
Where's the... where's the MVP?

232
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,260
Wait, I want to see.

233
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,300
Oh, it's on the Hulk page.

234
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,840
Oh, okay.

235
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,420
Oh!

236
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,680
Oh, that's pretty.

237
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,100
Okay, this one's really pretty.

238
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
I actually like this Cloak and Dagger skin.

239
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
Wait, this Cloak and Dagger skin is really pretty.

240
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,260
And you know what's the best part?

241
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:30,160
Um, the best part is that, uh, you can't confuse this for Sue.

242
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:44,880
It looks different from... If you have the Cloak form on, you won't get confused with the other blonde woman.

243
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,060
That's... that's the best part, guys.

244
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,120
Wait, I missed it?

245
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,460
I missed the...

246
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,500
Oh, is it inspect?

247
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,340
No, it's not inspect.

248
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,920
Ooh, he looks so cool though.

249
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,280
All right, and then that's the... that's in Battle Pass.

250
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,340
All right, Hulk.

251
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,500
MVP.

252
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,200
This one.

253
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,360
Oh my god, that is so sick.

254
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,720
That is actually...

255
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,340
That is actually so... I don't know.

256
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,300
I just... there's just something about it.

257
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,840
That's actually so sick.

258
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,820
Wait, it's in the Battle Pass.

259
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,300
Okay, wait.

260
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,680
Open.

261
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,860
Yeah, the Drip on Banner?

262
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:43,000
I mean, to be fair, the thing has his, uh, his trench coat, so they have to give something for Hulk as well.

263
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,460
Wait, how did I miss it?

264
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,900
Which one is it?

265
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,120
Ooh, the coin trick.

266
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,100
Can you do it, too?

267
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,860
Oh, oh, there it is!

268
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,560
I see it now.

269
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,760
Wait, does she have one?

270
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,740
No, Luna doesn't have one?

271
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,500
Oh, this is the runway.

272
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,260
Ooh, oh, because she's like a model in this one.

273
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm sad.

274
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,340
I don't get why Luna doesn't have one.

275
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,650
Oh, yeah.

276
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:31,430
I swear to god, if Squirrel Girl... God, I wish the hair was different.

277
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,510
I wish she had the different hairstyle.

278
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,050
Like, everything else is so good!

279
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,330
Everything else is so good.

280
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,550
It's just the hair.

281
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,050
It's literally just the hair.

282
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:50,570
But, like, I swear to god, if, like, Squirrel Girl has sound effects for every time she does anything, I'm gonna be so fucking annoyed.

283
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,250
Oh my god.

284
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,790
Okay, that... that's sick.

285
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,510
That is... that is really sick.

286
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,610
That's... I can see a lot of... I can see the Genji mains all...

287
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,130
I mean, all Genji mains are Spider-Man players anyway.

288
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:16,990
I can see, like, all the Genji Spider-Man mains using this skin and this MVP.

289
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,590
I can see it.

290
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:27,210
It reminds me of... it reminds me of, like, when the Olympic skins first came out for Overwatch.

291
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:36,390
And then, um, everybody was paying, like, hundreds of dollars just to unlock the Genji Japan skin.

292
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,410
Like, everybody was like, this is it.

293
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,470
This is the one thing I want in life.

294
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,270
Yeah, the Nihon Genji skin.

295
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,270
He does not look like Captain America for me.

296
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,910
I don't know.

297
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,190
I'm not feeling that one.

298
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,670
I can see pizza.

299
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,990
I can see pizza going for this.

300
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,270
Oh my god, look at his abs.

301
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,410
Oh!

302
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,750
I can't wait for them to make them watch a fucking 10-minute cutscene.

303
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:24,790
When... if I ever get MVP... if you ever get MVP on Cloak and Dagger, you deserve to have this 10-minute cutscene.

304
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,710
Like...

305
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:37,910
Like, they're just sitting there losing and you have to watch this fucker with the longest ass MVP intro ever.

306
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,130
Like, cutscene jail.

307
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,110
All right.

308
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,710
Others... okay, the newest team ups.

309
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,270
So...

310
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,830
Where are the newest team ups here?

311
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,730
Uh, did they put it in yet?

312
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:59,330
Oh yeah, so Bucky is gone in this team up, so you don't have ammo overload anymore.

313
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,650
Uh, Namor is gone from this team up.

314
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,930
Uh, what else?

315
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,470
Uh, Psylocke is gone from the team up for season two.

316
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:18,350
Uh, all of these are old, but they were... these are all... and then Gamma Charge for Namor.

317
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:25,310
I was told that this... you know how, like, people have been banning Namor and Luna?

318
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,890
Uh, because the team...

319
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,110
you know, Luna or Namor, because the team up for them was so fucking broken.

320
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,570
I was told Gamma Namor is worse.

321
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:56,390
It's... it's even... which is very surprising that it can be... oh my god, it can be even worse than Luna, because that shit was not fun.

322
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,830
He will initiate a Gamma upgrade.

323
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:06,570
When Namor receives the radiation, he will summon an extra Gamma, which continuously fire Gamma rays at locked on enemies.

324
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,430
The longer the ray hits, the higher the damage.

325
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,270
So, you have to kill the squid or you're fucked.

326
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,110
Like, that is so much worse.

327
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:29,650
That is... because, like, the Luna one, at least, is like... it freezes and it slows you down, but this...

328
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,650
this sounds so much worse.

329
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,710
My Hulk is going to the trenches.

330
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,330
Either they ban your... ban the Hulk or they have to ban Namor.

331
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,790
I would honestly just ban Namor, because fuck that shit.

332
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,390
Playing against Namor is just... is just fucking rough in general.

333
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,470
I just hate playing as Namor.

334
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,410
Um, all right.

335
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,430
What other... what other stuff did they added?

336
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:11,770
Okay, so, uh, Stars Align, Mental Projection, and I've seen these before on Twitter, but I'll show you guys this.

337
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,330
So,

338
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,650
uh, all right.

339
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:23,270
So, basically, replacing Skywitch will hold down the attack to unleash a rapid magical missile.

340
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,770
Okay, so she just launches missiles and stuff.

341
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:26,990
I don't know.

342
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,330
That doesn't seem that broken.

343
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,750
Doesn't seem that bad.

344
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,190
I mean, you still have to aim it.

345
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:44,330
All I'm saying is, you still have to aim this compared to what the fuck we just saw with Gamma...

346
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,590
Gamma Namor.

347
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,850
Gamma Namor was fucking ridiculous.

348
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,510
Gamma Namor is actually like, what the fuck?

349
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,390
Like, I... what am I gonna do?

350
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,670
I'm gonna fucking die.

351
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,470
Um, NoName, thank you for the super chat.

352
00:27:59,530 --> 00:27:59,830
Thank you.

353
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,530
Thank you.

354
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:06,190
We're getting close to having a team of all white women looking out, since you can shapeshift.

355
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,950
Thank you for the super chat, NoName.

356
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,390
Thank you.

357
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:08,830
Thank you.

358
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,010
Loli, thank you for the super chat.

359
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,370
Thank you.

360
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:10,890
Thank you.

361
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,830
Hey, Dougie, my sugar cup arrived today.

362
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,290
Yeah!

363
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,170
Thank you for the super chat.

364
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:14,510
Thank you.

365
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,190
Thank you.

366
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,430
Uh, I'm glad.

367
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,530
I'm glad all the gamers and stuff are starting to... starting to arrive now.

368
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,650
Okay, what is this?

369
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:27,250
Winter can leap to the aid of a designated ally, slamming to the ground with his mechanical arm to deal damage.

370
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:27,830
Oh, okay.

371
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,250
So he basically...

372
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,890
Okay, so it's basically like Captain... he's like a mini Captain America.

373
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,130
What is this Captain?

374
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,590
Contract to each other once both parties confirm, the duo collides.

375
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,090
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

376
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,750
Oh my god.

377
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,330
Wait, oh, I just... the bro hype.

378
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,290
I just noticed that.

379
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,650
You literally, like, sandwich them.

380
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:57,230
You can do a little fuckies, like, high five in between.

381
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,030
A little threesome between...

382
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,350
Okay.

383
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,270
Oh, this one is pretty... this one is broken as fuck.

384
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,770
Like, this one...

385
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,270
Like, this is another instance of fuck supports, I guess.

386
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,750
Like, who do I shoot?

387
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:31,830
Like, this is... yeah, this is another one of, like...

388
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,610
Yeah, not... not fun.

389
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,110
Not fun.

390
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,510
Wait, he can do it himself?

391
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,170
Oh, he just needs Emma Frost.

392
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,750
Wait, he can do... wait.

393
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:54,890
Does Emma Frost has to be within the vicinity to do this?

394
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,530
Like...

395
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,370
Oh, wait a minute.

396
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,720
Wait, he can...

397
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:10,730
Wait, so he doesn't even... Emma doesn't even have to be close to him.

398
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,570
Oh my god.

399
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,230
No, this is fuck... no, this is actually fucking terrible.

400
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:23,070
Just imagine that, um, the Psylocke flanking you as a support player.

401
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:30,870
This is fucking terrible for supports, because now I have to deal with two Psylockes.

402
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:38,930
I have to figure out which one is the... I have to quickly figure out which Psylocke is the right Psylocke.

403
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,890
Like...

404
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,170
Like, what do you... why are text all out of your... I already have to deal with so much.

405
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,390
What do you mean?

406
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,470
Make it three for no reason.

407
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:59,230
My... my... Galactic, thank you for the magenta super.

408
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,630
Thank you, thank you.

409
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,450
My beloved white queen, Emma Frost.

410
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,070
I'm so happy she's finally in the game.

411
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,970
She's one of my favorite mutant and Marvel characters.

412
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,210
I'm looking forward to all the new Frost Simpson artwork.

413
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,430
I can't wait for more X-Men in the future.

414
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,570
Thank you for the magenta super, Galactic.

415
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,790
Thank you, thank you.

416
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,710
Oh my god.

417
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,510
That's still 30 seconds too short.

418
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,150
I don't know.

419
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,170
I can't deal with that.

420
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,950
That's still too short for me.

421
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,930
All right, let's see.

422
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,410
Where's Emma Frost?

423
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,650
There she is.

424
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,510
All right, there's the queen.

425
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,670
All right, she's a three-star difficulty.

426
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,830
All right, there's the... whoa.

427
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,250
I saw the MVP for this.

428
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,010
I'll... I'll show you guys the MVP.

429
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,210
Oh my god.

430
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,210
Whoa.

431
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:13,030
I think it's like particularly... there's like one moment there where I was like, oh my god.

432
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,210
Oh wow, like for that skin?

433
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:23,950
Wow.

434
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,750
My mind just get off the screen.

435
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,530
Star, thank you for the super chat.

436
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,990
Thank you, thank you.

437
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,790
I... wow, okay.

438
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,510
Actually, I like this skin more.

439
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:49,110
Naturally, I wish it was the top here and then the bottom here to show the thighs, you know.

440
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,850
It's a crime that that has to be covered.

441
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,190
It's... it's honestly... honestly a crime.

442
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,370
True.

443
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,450
If they... whoa, she did that herself.

444
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,190
Wait, what?

445
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,850
She... she did that herself.

446
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,770
Like, this should never be covered, queen.

447
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,730
Like, you know what you have.

448
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,030
You gotta just show it.

449
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,830
Like, I like...

450
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,430
Like, maybe like...

451
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,250
This part.

452
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,850
Keep this part here and then transfer it over here.

453
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,530
Whoa, okay.

454
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,010
Let's see.

455
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,050
I think... I don't know.

456
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,690
I don't know which one.

457
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,030
Okay, we'll use the default for now.

458
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:45,910
All right, the abilities.

459
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:57,030
All right, that's a tracking... a tracking left click and then develop a crushing foot fisted strike.

460
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,910
Okay, and then when she's in diamond form, she has melee.

461
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,750
So, diamond form is melee only.

462
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,950
And then her Q... her Q is crazy.

463
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,650
Okay, from what I've heard...

464
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,750
Um, her Q... okay, I'll show you guys again.

465
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,630
This is tracking.

466
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,530
No, this is tracking.

467
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,130
This is 100% tracking.

468
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:19,730
Um, this one.

469
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,390
This shit is crazy because it silences you.

470
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:33,790
Um, basically when you get hit by this, you cannot use any abilities and it damages you too.

471
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,990
And um, yeah, and it pulls you forward.

472
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:44,290
So, the only support character that can counter this ult is Luna ult.

473
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,890
It's literally the only ult that counters it from what I saw.

474
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:59,450
So, like no other ult can counter this because the cloak and dagger ult... the cloak and dagger ult... you can make the cloak and dagger thing and then she just does this and pulls you out of the ult.

475
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:08,110
Invis... no, if you use Invis women ult, she can pull you out of the Invis ult too.

476
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,250
So, I'm talking about like support counters.

477
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:16,110
She can pull you out of an Invis ult, but the Luna ult doesn't silence it.

478
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,950
It goes like straight to, yeah.

479
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:23,610
So, like if a good Emma Frost, uh, a good Emma Frost can literally just pull you out.

480
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:29,010
Mantis... Mantis is possible, but like it still silences you.

481
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,650
It silences your entire team.

482
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,770
So, like yeah, your team is like healed and everything.

483
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,770
You're still pulled forward in the Mantis ult too.

484
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,730
Like you can't do anything.

485
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,290
It just pulls you forward after.

486
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,900
No, like you can... no, it uses... it uses it.

487
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,340
You can... you can count... you can like count... get... have the ult out.

488
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,360
Like you can activate the ult before it fully activates the silence.

489
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,920
That's what I mean.

490
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,720
Like, yeah, like when the moment the silence hits you, then you're ulted.

491
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,900
But like the her pull...

492
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,120
because there's a lot of ults where you're placing the heals.

493
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:13,880
Um, so when you're placing the cloak and dagger ult, she can pull you out of the ult of the cloak and dagger.

494
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,900
But Luna can dance around.

495
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,300
She is not... she's immune to the... she is immune to the pull.

496
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,640
So she can like just run around and everything.

497
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,640
So that's what I mean.

498
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,180
I was like watching it and stuff.

499
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,220
Um,

500
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,870
all right.

501
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,130
Okay.

502
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,050
Wow, I can't believe they have a command grab in Rivals now.

503
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,930
Wait, what the fuck?

504
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,610
Wait, what?

505
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,950
Seize control of an enemy sentience.

506
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,170
Damage dealt to the... got your nose.

507
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,390
Got your fucking soul.

508
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,010
I... holy shit.

509
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,510
Bro, I grabbed the man's soul.

510
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:15,410
Like damage dealt to the sentience cascades to the physical form and can be pierced by telepathic pulse.

511
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:23,990
And when it shatters, it unleashes extra... oh my god, I'm actually breaking his actual mind break.

512
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:28,510
It unleashes extra damage on its owner.

513
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,630
So even when it... wait, can they cancel this?

514
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,710
Can they grab their soul back?

515
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:34,700
Can they...

516
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,850
Can they grab it back?

517
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,550
Can they put it back inside them?

518
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,090
Okay, that's a barrier.

519
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,230
Oh my god, she's actually mind breaking.

520
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:47,930
No.

521
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,390
How do you defend?

522
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,430
Okay.

523
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,930
Bro, put it back.

524
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,110
Put it back inside.

525
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,130
Oh, and then you kick him to the wall.

526
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,970
That would give me back my soul.

527
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,350
Give it back.

528
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,350
Give me back my soul.

529
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,090
All right, let's try a...

530
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,990
All right, uh, practice.

531
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,290
Thank you for the super chat.

532
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:19,730
Thank you.

533
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,490
Thank you.

534
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,950
That's so funny.

535
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,870
Mind control is real.

536
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,430
What's the passive?

537
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,150
Let me check.

538
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,290
All right.

539
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,430
Uh, oh, where was it?

540
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,670
All right, pass it.

541
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,650
Oh, it's a mind link.

542
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,510
That's, uh, it's a mind link and I'm pretty sure...

543
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,350
Let's see, team up a bit.

544
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,690
I think it's, uh, where is it?

545
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,130
That's the team up ability.

546
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,010
I think the passive is damage reduction, right?

547
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,730
I know, like, in diamond form, she gets damage reduction and stuff.

548
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,290
Yeah, plus 100 hp.

549
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:58,990
Yeah.

550
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,130
Wait, plus 100 hp?

551
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,010
Jesus Christ.

552
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,330
Okay.

553
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:03,950
Oh, I forgot.

554
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,150
Everything is new.

555
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,630
My settings in this...

556
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,710
1.83.

557
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,930
1.83.

558
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,250
Uh, give me a sec.

559
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:13,750
Let me...

560
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,090
Rebind everything real quick, guys.

561
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,790
I forgot that all my stuff is not the same.

562
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,890
Because it's, like, technically a new account.

563
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,410
What?

564
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,710
What is...

565
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,990
Oh, what?

566
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,930
That's the melee?

567
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,450
Oh, shit.

568
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:35,770
Okay.

569
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,170
Yeah, see?

570
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:37,690
It's tracking.

571
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,210
It's literally a tracking ability.

572
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,030
So, like...

573
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,410
Okay, what's the range?

574
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,050
Okay, this is the range...

575
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,430
for it.

576
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:54,980
So, like, I can track with this and then when I'm on diamond...

577
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,020
Oh, got your soul.

578
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,080
And then for this, it's melee.

579
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,060
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

580
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,540
And then, boom.

581
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,600
And that is a cooldown.

582
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
So, that's a cooldown.

583
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,980
And then, got your soul.

584
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,900
Yoink.

585
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,980
Time to mind break you.

586
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:20,920
What's this?

587
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,160
Okay, this is a barrier.

588
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,360
Oh my god.

589
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,620
Okay.

590
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,540
Thank god.

591
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,640
Okay, this is gonna confuse me.

592
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,830
All right, and then...

593
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,390
Obviously, this is the thing everybody loves.

594
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:36,930
Boom.

595
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:41,310
Okay, so, the command grab.

596
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,710
Okay, that can melee it, too.

597
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,590
Wait, I can melee the soul as well.

598
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,170
Not the mind break.

599
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,730
All right, let's do no cooldown.

600
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,470
So, I can... Okay, diamond for him.

601
00:40:59,170 --> 00:40:59,610
Boom.

602
00:40:59,610 --> 00:40:59,610
Okay.

603
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,750
All right, so, I can do that.

604
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,770
I need to get closer, though.

605
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,970
I need to get closer to do this.

606
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,110
No!

607
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:09,970
Okay, fuck.

608
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,570
Okay, it's like an actual combo.

609
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,490
It's like an actual combo, yet the master.

610
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,470
All right, get over here.

611
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,770
Oh, that's fucking right.

612
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,290
I need to put you on the wall.

613
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,090
I need this.

614
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,390
That's right.

615
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,490
Get over here.

616
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,090
That's fucking right.

617
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,470
All right, so, this is... Wait.

618
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,430
Okay, 500 for the shield.

619
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,950
All right, and this is the...

620
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,830
Wait, what's... Okay, this is the...

621
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,430
Get over here.

622
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,630
That's right.

623
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,530
So, you see like... Yeah, that's fucking right.

624
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:56,810
Apparently...

625
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,290
You can have... They'll turn around, too.

626
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:00,870
I think.

627
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,050
Look, you can make them turn around.

628
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,130
The mind break.

629
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,730
That's scary.

630
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,370
That's sort of scary.

631
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,810
Imagine like they're behind you.

632
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,010
Oh, wait.

633
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,470
Yeah, it does so much damage.

634
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,410
What?

635
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:23,850
Okay.

636
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:24,670
Okay.

637
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,170
Okay.

638
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,290
Get over here.

639
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:28,850
Turn around.

640
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:29,530
That's right.

641
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,030
You turn around.

642
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,050
Just walk.

643
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:35,910
You can't.

644
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,030
You can't walk out.

645
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,670
You get like sucked up.

646
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,090
All right, let's see.

647
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,610
I want to see the team up for...

648
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:46,990
How do I activate?

649
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,830
This is the first time I've activated this.

650
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:49,770
Okay, gee.

651
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,070
Where's the team up?

652
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,510
Get me my Emma Frost.

653
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,210
Wait, what?

654
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,470
No, I want to be...

655
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,830
What the fuck?

656
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,390
Wait, no, I want to be...

657
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,330
I want to be the Psylocke of this team up.

658
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:03,910
There we go.

659
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:04,850
All right.

660
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,650
Until I return to my world once again.

661
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,250
Which one's me?

662
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,090
Oh my god!

663
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:13,960
Okay.

664
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:19,800
Okay.

665
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,380
Oh, wait.

666
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,300
That's not what I want.

667
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,540
All right.

668
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,720
It actually moves around.

669
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,920
It actually moves around too.

670
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,400
Look it.

671
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,260
It's me and you.

672
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,920
It's me and you.

673
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,980
Which one's not real?

674
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,340
Me.

675
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,000
Oh, that would be so... because like there's like a cooldown.

676
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,260
You can do this.

677
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,700
You can clone up.

678
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,840
So when you clone up, we're both blue.

679
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,880
So you can't tell.

680
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,040
So like when you...

681
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,280
Oh, wait.

682
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:46,760
Does it do it?

683
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,140
Let's try.

684
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:48,880
Oh, it doesn't.

685
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,080
It doesn't do the ult.

686
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,160
It doesn't do the ult, but it does dashes.

687
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,640
It does dashes and...

688
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,140
This...

689
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,320
Does it go invisible with me?

690
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,280
I can't tell.

691
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,060
Oh, thank god.

692
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,880
If only.

693
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,220
Which one is me?

694
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,720
The one second you... the support has to figure out which one's the real Psylocke.

695
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,720
Since I could be like right... I could do this and then the support has to figure it out.

696
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,880
And then... because I have like a second of like we're both blue.

697
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,360
Yeah.

698
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,440
That's actually scary though.

699
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,880
That's so scary.

700
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:31,540
All right.

701
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,220
That's so scary.

702
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,280
I'm gonna be so scared.

703
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,020
Wait.

704
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,420
Oh, she doesn't copy the...

705
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,920
She can't copy the Magneto.

706
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,060
Imagine if there's like two fears.

707
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,100
Imagine.

708
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,880
Imagine there's like two fears.

709
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,820
Oh my god.

710
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,960
I'd be so sad.

711
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,340
I'd be so sad.

712
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,480
Boom.

713
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,300
There you go.

714
00:44:59,360 --> 00:44:59,780
Goodbye.

715
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,000
Goodbye.

716
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,720
Fear!

717
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,260
Fear!

718
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,240
That would be way too scary.

719
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:07,720
Yeah.

720
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,510
Wait, that's a lot.

721
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,550
It's actually a lot.

722
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,290
Oh my god.

723
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,950
Me and you getting gave were both the same.

724
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,850
Me and you.

725
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,290
All right, double shield.

726
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,310
Wait.

727
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:31,930
Wait.

728
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:32,910
Wait.

729
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:34,690
Imagine.

730
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,510
Oh my god.

731
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:37,190
Okay, wait.

732
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,430
That's actually crazy.

733
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,570
And then we just do this.

734
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,950
What are they gonna do?

735
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,810
Wait, that's illegal.

736
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:53,970
That's illegal.

737
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:55,470
Wait.

738
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,290
All right, and then...

739
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:07,490
Oh, yeah, I have the... it wouldn't matter if she has, but like this part seems fucking broken.

740
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,250
We built a wall.

741
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,630
We actually built a wall.

742
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,790
Wait, can we actually shield two people?

743
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:17,390
We'll see.

744
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:19,770
Don't worry.

745
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:20,770
I'll be a hero.

746
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,910
All right, I need you guys to respawn so I can be a hero.

747
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,700
Wait, did I do it?

748
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,500
I can't tell.

749
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,500
Did I do it?

750
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,980
Oh, he takes damage too.

751
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,540
My clone also takes damage.

752
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,020
Okay.

753
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,240
Did I save you?

754
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,280
Wait, can I give my clone a barrier?

755
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:46,920
Wait, wait.

756
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,540
Wait, oh my god.

757
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,710
We'll shield both of us.

758
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,550
We'll protect you team.

759
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,230
We'll... no way.

760
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,110
Oh my god.

761
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,330
I will be a hero.

762
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:10,130
You get a barrier.

763
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,570
You get a barrier.

764
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:15,310
No, for bots, it's only like one.

765
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:16,970
I can only give it to one.

766
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,250
Yeah, see I can't give... wait.

767
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,410
Yeah, I can't give it to more than... yeah, that's awful.

768
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,950
I love it.

769
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,110
You get a barrier and I'll get a barrier.

770
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:28,950
All right.

771
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,850
Okay, so the Namor...

772
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,130
Namor... all right, I'll try the Namor one.

773
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,730
The Namor Gamma.

774
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:38,790
I know why I went back to spawn.

775
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,650
I feel like I was in Overwatch just then.

776
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:49,510
I was so used to going back to spawn for Overwatch that I forgot I don't have to do that.

777
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,430
All right, let's see.

778
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,090
Namor and Gamma.

779
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,830
All right, try.

780
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,310
All right, what's the range?

781
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,060
Goodbye GalactaBotUltra.

782
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,040
WHAT THE FUCK?!

783
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,900
WHERE IS HE SHOOTING?!

784
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,220
WAIT!

785
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,660
WAIT!

786
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,240
WAIT!

787
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,980
HE SAID SHOOTING!

788
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:21,840
WAIT!

789
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,700
NO!

790
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,120
HE JUST AIMED AT HIM!

791
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,700
OUTTA NOWHERE!

792
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,580
Okay, when is that range?

793
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,600
Okay, that's actually crazy.

794
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,410
Oh my god, like imagine if I just put this here.

795
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,260
I'd be like, where's the fucking range?!

796
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,460
Oh my god.

797
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,180
People are definitely not gonna like that, guys.

798
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,220
Yeah, that range is actually criminal.

799
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,360
All right.

800
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,120
All right, spawn.

801
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,380
Okay, here we go.

802
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,560
Oh, there it is!

803
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,380
There it is!

804
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,880
But what if I put- oh, hey, that's new.

805
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,740
Oh, wait, it's not new.

806
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,140
I just never seen it before.

807
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:23,660
Oh my god, and like good namers are fucking scary too.

808
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:30,700
Because a lot of good namers, they would just flank and then they put their fucking turrets at the craziest spot.

809
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,180
Like at the spots I never expected and I can hide in too.

810
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:43,660
Imagine if I did that with the- Oh my god, I do that with the normal ones too.

811
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:53,260
I do- I just do that with the normal Gamma.

812
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,480
Yeah, the portal is new, yeah.

813
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,320
That's scary.

814
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:04,840
That's- That's pretty scary, not gonna lie.

815
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,500
That does too- yeah, that does way too much damage.

816
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,420
All right, what other stuff do you want?

817
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,940
Yeah, it's tower defense.

818
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,680
Yeah, we're- It's tower defense time.

819
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,140
Do the right click rage.

820
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,800
That?

821
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:20,700
Oh, that's new.

822
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,020
Okay, how much?

823
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,400
How much damage do I do?

824
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,520
I do that.

825
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,620
Oh wait, that, that.

826
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,180
Goodbye.

827
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,900
Are you not hitting him?

828
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,880
Am I- oh, is it this block?

829
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,340
Oh, this is LLS.

830
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:56,740
Oh my god, these are like actual- these are actual- can- Did you think about it?

831
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,940
They're cancerous!

832
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,140
Oh!

833
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,820
Did you think about it?

834
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,900
They're actual- No!

835
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,460
No!

836
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,360
It's like that Harley Quinn gun!

837
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,560
I just give him cancer!

838
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,840
Oh my god, he shot that guy!

839
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,160
There you go.

840
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,280
So he does that.

841
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,860
That's messed up, buddy.

842
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,240
You get Harley Quinn, you gave me cancer?

843
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,900
No, it's actually the cancer rate!

844
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,120
No, Namor!

845
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,720
Please!

846
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,460
We'll save the ocean!

847
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:43,660
No!

848
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,040
Are you giving me cancer?

849
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,620
That's basically it, like.

850
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,780
Check hex shot.

851
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,560
How high can you place it?

852
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,560
Let's see.

853
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,220
It shoots faster after a headshot?

854
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,640
Yeah, it does, actually.

855
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,900
I hate Namor.

856
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,720
Every time people are like, why you ban Namor?

857
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,580
This is why.

858
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,640
This is exactly why I ban Namor.

859
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:39,240
This is why I fucked- and Namor is like one of the easiest- Because he's like, he does so much damage and he has cancer rate.

860
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,520
Now he has a rate that does that.

861
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,000
Goodbye, tanks.

862
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,700
Yeah, Namor seems like a fucking ban for sure.

863
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,780
What else?

864
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,560
Uh, don't worry.

865
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,120
They also buffed Hella too.

866
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,740
All right, let's see.

867
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,240
What else did they change?

868
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,300
Did they change anything else?

869
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,520
Uh...

870
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,440
That's funny.

871
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:22,580
They gave Spider-Man one of the coolest skins in the game and then they- They gave Namor that, like.

872
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,220
That's so fucking funny.

873
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,400
They're like, oh, yeah, you like?

874
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,000
I'm a good guy.

875
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,320
Yeah, you- you love- You love that skin?

876
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,360
Well, how does it feel to never play that?

877
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,940
All right, so what they did is that everybody has armor now.

878
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,260
Shit, okay.

879
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,140
So that's what makes it broken.

880
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,920
His ult is a defensive ult and a damage amplifier.

881
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:59,340
so Um, you get- so now- Rocket can now be a defensive character instead of just aggression.

882
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,080
So you get- you literally get armor for it.

883
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,480
And damage amplifier.

884
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,800
That's so fucking broken.

885
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,480
That's so- oh my god.

886
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,960
You have to coordinate balance with the team.

887
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,460
You have to coordinate balance.

888
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,420
It's still a damage amplifier though, it's still a lot.

889
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,780
All right, um...

890
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,040
Yeah, but it still amplifies damage.

891
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,800
It still does- it's still more than default.

892
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,780
Uh, and then there is... what was it?

893
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,280
There's uh...

894
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,220
No, they should have removed more rights after that.

895
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,380
Oh, yeah, I heard about the Moon Knight buff.

896
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,040
They gave him like something new, right?

897
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,860
What did they give him new?

898
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,840
It was this, right?

899
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,420
Yeah, that's the- hers right click is the new one, right?

900
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,080
I'm pretty sure it was.

901
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,440
I think it's uh...

902
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,980
Yeah, he has right click.

903
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,700
Yeah, you get shield now.

904
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,360
How much shield do you get?

905
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:09,980
350.

906
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,880
You get 350 heals if you land your right click, but it's still a cool down.

907
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,040
And the fast escape?

908
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,440
Wait, which one is it?

909
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,580
So fast.

910
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,840
Where am I now?

911
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:30,800
All right.

912
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,000
Faster- yeah, it's faster.

913
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,080
I noticed that too.

914
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,900
Like that's so- it- The right click feels like a hitscan now.

915
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:42,040
It feels like um... does it go faster?

916
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,620
Doesn't feel that as fast.

917
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,560
I don't know.

918
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,260
No, it all feels the same- similar.

919
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,340
I don't know.

920
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,240
It feels very similar.

921
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,040
I don't find it that much faster.

922
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,620
It is a little longer though.

923
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:03,940
Yeah.

924
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,220
It is a little longer.

925
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:13,060
Yeah, it's longer, but it doesn't- it doesn't feel like it goes down that fast.

926
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:17,820
All right.

927
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,920
Oh, it did add music.

928
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,200
Yeah, they added music to it.

929
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,140
Yeah, I just noticed.

930
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,220
Scarlet witch?

931
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,120
Oh, the team up.

932
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,000
Oh, yeah, let me try.

933
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,640
Team up.

934
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,100
Scarlet witch.

935
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:31,800
What is it?

936
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,060
This?

937
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,340
What do I do with it?

938
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,000
Oh, it's her right click.

939
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,920
Oh, that's a lot of damage.

940
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:41,460
Never mind.

941
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:45,880
Never mind.

942
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,320
That feels like a lot of damage.

943
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,120
Yeah, it's still tracking.

944
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,420
Does it do headshot?

945
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,680
Yeah, it's still tracking though.

946
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,480
What's the range?

947
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,620
Excuse me?

948
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,900
Wait, wait a minute.

949
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,360
Wait a- wait a minute.

950
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,320
Wait a minute.

951
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,700
Why is it still doing so much damage?

952
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,140
Wait, why is it still doing so much?

953
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,600
There's no fall back.

954
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,800
There's no fall damage.

955
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,620
There's no- there's no- There's no fall damage to it.

956
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,700
Okay, wait.

957
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:43,340
Fall off.

958
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,140
Is it real?

959
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,460
There's no fall off.

960
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:47,760
Yeah.

961
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,180
Sorry, I meant fall off.

962
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,800
That's scary actually.

963
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,920
It's like- I can finally be able to play.

964
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,920
I'm like, wait.

965
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,080
Wait a minute.

966
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,220
Okay.

967
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:08,760
Okay.

968
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,460
Oh my god, wait.

969
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,160
I can right click and- okay, wait, wait, wait.

970
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,300
Okay.

971
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,380
How do I do this?

972
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,860
Oh, I have to do it closer.

973
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,020
Okay, give me a sec.

974
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,580
Let me do it closer.

975
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,040
What the fuck?

976
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,120
What?

977
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,660
How do I do it with both though?

978
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,240
Gotta be close.

979
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:36,880
Okay.

980
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:39,720
Oh!

981
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:41,940
I see.

982
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,000
I see now.

983
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,640
Yeah, I see it now.

984
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:48,460
Okay, that's a- Uh, I don't know if she'll still be good.

985
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,180
Why play her when I can play Cancer Gun?

986
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:58,080
Wait, where is my- I really- Like, why play her when I have this guy?

987
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:02,800
True.

988
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,040
Why not both?

989
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,580
Is her ult still the same?

990
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,240
Terrible?

991
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,320
Yep.

992
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,520
Still is terrible.

993
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,640
Still- charge up is still- I know I just killed four, but they were all stationary.

994
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,780
You don't understand.

995
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:25,860
Her ult has to be like one of the hardest things to um, one of the hardest things to like counter.

996
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,500
Hardest thing to like, um, to actually get it out.

997
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,580
She's faster?

998
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,320
Barely.

999
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:40,460
It's so- yeah, it's- it's barely faster.

1000
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,340
Like, oh, I can move.

1001
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,000
I can move it like that.

1002
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,880
That's three.

1003
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,600
That did the trick.

1004
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,480
Like, I guess you could do this.

1005
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,740
But I just gotta shield it.

1006
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,420
Just get shield up.

1007
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,080
Still looks cool though, at least.

1008
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,560
All right, uh, Penny?

1009
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,420
Oh, she can headshot, right?

1010
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,760
Oh shit, wait.

1011
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,340
Oh, you can- Okay.

1012
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,200
You can headshot now.

1013
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,120
You can move an inch further.

1014
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,800
Yeah, there's the headshot.

1015
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,500
It's just that.

1016
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,060
It's a little crazy.

1017
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:24,860
Uh...

1018
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,120
Yeah, but there's- it is a little crazy because she don't- she doesn't need a reload at all.

1019
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,060
So like...

1020
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:41,420
Like, the fact that she doesn't have to reload a crit attack is like a little scary for people who can aim.

1021
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,980
Yeah, and the 750 HP too.

1022
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,440
I don't know how to play Penny, so I can't do any crazy movement.

1023
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:52,420
Yeah.

1024
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,720
Good aim- people with good aim on Penny is gonna be scary.

1025
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,420
Oh, yeah, just because of the fact that like, she doesn't- she never needs to reload.

1026
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,960
She just needs to left click forever.

1027
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:06,940
And then does that.

1028
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,740
All right, guys.

1029
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,060
Time to finally test out.

1030
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,360
Test- test everything out.

1031
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,120
Don't worry.

1032
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,660
I should be able to play Emma Frost, right?

1033
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,200
All right.

1034
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,840
That should be everything.

1035
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,020
It's time.

1036
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:23,220
It's time to finally check out Emma Frost.

1037
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,120
Also, thank you for the magenta super.

1038
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,360
Hey, guys.

1039
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:26,760
Thank you.

1040
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,400
Sorry, we're bringing up something I really appreciate.

1041
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,580
Yeah, of course.

1042
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,520
I'll update the long winter server after the stream.

1043
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,280
But thank you.

1044
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,780
Thank you for the magenta super.

1045
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,300
Thank you.

1046
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:36,820
Thank you.

1047
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:44,240
I feel like Emma- Because, I mean, her ability- she has a tracking ability.

1048
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,940
So like, she's basically Zarya.

1049
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,560
And I love playing Zarya.

1050
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,740
Zarya was like not- Zarya- Oh my god.

1051
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,160
I was like, where is she?

1052
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:55,660
Yes!

1053
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,620
My- my computer is stronger than all of yours!

1054
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,600
I have the better PC!

1055
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:13,880
Yes!

1056
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,000
Yes!

1057
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,240
My PC is better!

1058
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:24,510
I was like, which- which blonde woman?

1059
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,530
Which one is it?

1060
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:37,450
But she just feels like Zarya, IMO, because of this.

1061
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,590
Is there- oh, this doesn't have ammo.

1062
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,890
Wait, I don't have the re- wait, where's the reload?

1063
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:43,830
Oh no, there it is.

1064
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:44,710
Nevermind, it's 70.

1065
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:45,210
Okay.

1066
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,270
Alright.

1067
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:49,930
Nice.

1068
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,430
This is not my melee when I'm not in diamond form.

1069
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,970
I'm gonna be so confused when I put the shields up.

1070
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:02,230
Shielding is like the- As in, they're not getting shielded.

1071
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:08,610
They're definitely not getting shielded, guys.

1072
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,630
I'll shield myself.

1073
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:13,810
Whoa.

1074
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,420
Get over here!

1075
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,180
Get your ass over here, that's fucked you, right?

1076
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:27,920
Weeeeeeeee!

1077
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:29,800
Weeeeeeeee!

1078
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,440
Got his nose!

1079
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,340
Wait, oh no, I was gonna get his soul.

1080
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,360
Time to mind break you.

1081
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,100
Alright.

1082
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,360
Get over here.

1083
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,500
Oh shit, don't worry, I got you.

1084
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,540
Don't worry.

1085
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:46,460
Boom!

1086
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,300
Oh, I missed the command grab.

1087
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,080
Alright, I won't get his soul.

1088
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,600
Got your soul!

1089
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:53,580
Oh, I did it.

1090
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,400
Guys, I'm still learning the soul grab.

1091
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,040
Oh, I have to aim the soul grab.

1092
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,120
Okay, that makes more sense, actually.

1093
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,960
I actually have to aim the soul grab.

1094
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,700
But I don't have to aim that!

1095
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:11,520
Okay.

1096
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,000
Alright.

1097
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:17,960
I think, like, doing it on the tank would be the easiest.

1098
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:22,380
Alright.

1099
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,960
I definitely- I'm gonna try doing it on the tank.

1100
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,440
Got your soul!

1101
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,940
That's right, you can't do anything about it!

1102
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,540
Can't do anything about it!

1103
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:36,620
Come on, break you.

1104
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,060
Damn.

1105
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,860
You know what?

1106
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,120
I'm gonna grab you.

1107
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,380
That's right, get back in here!

1108
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,660
Okay, grabbing the soul is very hard, guys.

1109
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,860
Like, it's surprisingly very hard to grab the soul.

1110
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,320
Oh, not hard enough!

1111
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,060
Alright, where did he go?

1112
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,820
Where did he go?

1113
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:09,560
Alright.

1114
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:16,740
I can't- It's, like, easier to do- It's easier to do, uh, on the tank.

1115
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,820
I like that!

1116
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:22,680
Alright.

1117
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,480
Get over here!

1118
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,380
Get over here!

1119
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,340
Get over here!

1120
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,020
Okay.

1121
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,620
That's right.

1122
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:36,760
That's fine.

1123
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,400
I'll stand behind this.

1124
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,460
I'll stand behind this, guys.

1125
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,780
Come on, get over here.

1126
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:44,900
Oh shit!

1127
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:45,700
Oh shit!

1128
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,540
Oh my god, no!

1129
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:53,960
Dammit.

1130
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,620
Nice soul, nerd.

1131
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,200
Thanks, I'll- I think I'll take it.

1132
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:09,660
It's okay.

1133
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,360
I'm ready to grab another soul.

1134
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,040
Don't worry, I'm coming over.

1135
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,060
I'm ready to grab.

1136
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,200
Don't worry.

1137
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,840
Got you!

1138
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:26,800
Oh!

1139
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,120
Oh shit!

1140
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,060
Oh shit, guys!

1141
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,000
I don't think he liked that I grabbed his soul- grabbed him.

1142
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,300
Okay, I need to figure out how to do the soul grab better.

1143
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,140
That one I'm, like, struggling a lot.

1144
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,280
I'm struggling a lot with.

1145
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:46,680
There we go.

1146
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,700
Doesn't matter anymore.

1147
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,300
Get out!

1148
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,480
Oh!

1149
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,440
That's right.

1150
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,580
Coming over!

1151
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,840
Get over here!

1152
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,500
Got your soul!

1153
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,860
Gotta mind control you!

1154
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:07,860
Yoink!

1155
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:08,940
Mind break.

1156
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:12,500
Oh yeah?

1157
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:14,380
Yoink.

1158
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:21,180
Alright.

1159
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,820
Command grab!

1160
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,440
Get over here!

1161
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,040
Follow me, little man!

1162
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,180
Follow me!

1163
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,540
Follow me!

1164
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,080
Follow me, little man!

1165
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,940
Okay, I need to learn how to do that grab.

1166
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,780
I'm coming for you.

1167
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,540
I'm coming for you.

1168
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:42,980
Oh, wait.

1169
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,480
Oh, you're so lucky.

1170
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,180
You're so lucky.

1171
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,560
That's right!

1172
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:49,520
Kick!

1173
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:50,800
Soul grab!

1174
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,220
Come over here!

1175
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,000
Mind break time!

1176
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,460
Boom!

1177
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,140
So funny!

1178
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:00,940
Mind control!

1179
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,360
I'm ready!

1180
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,860
That's right.

1181
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:06,520
Yoink!

1182
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,900
Your soul is gonna work for me now.

1183
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,260
She is all- That's what I'm saying.

1184
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,620
She's basically Zarya.

1185
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,880
She feels like Zarya.

1186
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,860
This is so horrible for you.

1187
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:30,030
It just feels like...

1188
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:31,550
I don't know.

1189
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:32,230
It's just...

1190
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,050
She's just Zarya.

1191
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:36,490
She's like an off take.

1192
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,670
She's not a main take.

1193
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:38,730
Like, I'm not shielding.

1194
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,290
I don't know how you can shield.

1195
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,710
It's literally just damage.

1196
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:49,470
Damn.

1197
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:52,950
Oh, you're right.

1198
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,210
I could force the C9.

1199
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:55,350
You're right.

1200
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:57,370
I could just be like, look at me.

1201
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:01,210
She is most likely an off take.

1202
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:03,350
I don't know how you can do...

1203
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:07,210
Her shield is not that strong too.

1204
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,450
Her shield is like, what?

1205
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,950
500?

1206
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:11,110
Oh, I'm filling.

1207
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:12,170
No!

1208
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:14,430
My PC is not strong enough!

1209
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:15,770
No!

1210
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:16,550
It's fine.

1211
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:18,910
I think I filled.

1212
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,050
I think I...

1213
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,990
Somebody couldn't get Emma.

1214
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,250
And they all left.

1215
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:24,690
I literally...

1216
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:27,270
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I filled for this game.

1217
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:31,050
I'm gonna try Namor.

1218
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:31,830
It's time.

1219
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,350
I'm trying a character I normally don't play.

1220
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:34,970
It's time.

1221
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:37,930
We don't need no healers.

1222
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:39,990
We have Emma.

1223
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:46,990
There's no way four people loaded in before me.

1224
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:48,810
There's no fucking way.

1225
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,290
I refuse to believe it.

1226
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:51,190
No.

1227
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:52,690
I wanna try...

1228
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:54,290
Wait, I don't have a Hulk.

1229
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,090
Wait, you're right.

1230
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:56,110
Why am I playing Namor?

1231
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,030
I have no Hulk.

1232
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:59,850
What does it need?

1233
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:03,370
What does it need?

1234
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:03,750
Anything.

1235
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:04,870
Yeah, there's no Hulk.

1236
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,210
I don't have the squid for it.

1237
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:09,770
Is it time?

1238
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,310
No, I don't have Strange.

1239
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:12,370
Guys, I don't even...

1240
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:14,470
I don't even have Strange for this.

1241
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,790
It's Moon Knight time.

1242
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:20,110
Okay, it's...

1243
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,350
That's right.

1244
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:28,270
Random bullshit hours, everyone.

1245
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,590
It's random bullshit era.

1246
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,910
That's fucking right.

1247
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:37,690
Look at all that damage.

1248
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,130
Not gonna save you.

1249
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,590
I love...

1250
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:45,610
Whoa, shit.

1251
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,030
Oh, guys.

1252
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,070
You know what?

1253
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:48,870
I got my kill.

1254
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,530
That's fine.

1255
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:53,630
Oh, there he goes.

1256
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:55,330
It's okay.

1257
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:56,470
I got my kill.

1258
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:59,430
Guys, we are...

1259
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:02,410
Guys, why can't I be on the enemy team that Ashley ran?

1260
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:09,370
That must be nice.

1261
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,190
Guys, come on.

1262
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:13,870
They have...

1263
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:14,890
Wait, where are they?

1264
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,910
Okay, I was gonna be...

1265
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:18,350
Oh, they're not bunched up anymore.

1266
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,030
They learn.

1267
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,270
They learn about random bullshit.

1268
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:22,350
Oh, I hear you.

1269
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:27,130
Oh.

1270
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:29,270
Okay, he ran away.

1271
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:30,010
That's cool.

1272
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,630
Okay, buddy.

1273
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,290
Get out of here.

1274
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:36,930
I have ears.

1275
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,530
Get out.

1276
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:40,850
Wee!

1277
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:42,430
Oh, shit.

1278
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:42,850
Oh!

1279
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:49,410
Wee!

1280
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:49,630
Okay, gap.

1281
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:49,970
Oh, wait.

1282
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:50,990
Now we have two supports.

1283
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:51,810
Let's go.

1284
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:55,990
Yippee!

1285
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:58,170
Wee!

1286
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:00,570
Look, I'm the closest to ult, guys.

1287
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:01,510
I...

1288
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:04,010
It's not me.

1289
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,250
I'm literally the closest to...

1290
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,310
Oh, my god!

1291
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:09,170
He just went behind me!

1292
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:10,890
Wait, she did the...

1293
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:15,690
Guys, how did she get there?

1294
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,650
Guys, how did she get there?

1295
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:19,450
Okay, I'm still the closest to ult.

1296
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:21,110
So, like...

1297
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,550
I'm doing my job.

1298
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:25,930
Guys.

1299
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:28,430
I'm not coming here to play.

1300
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:30,710
Okay, I don't have...

1301
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:31,170
You know what?

1302
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,770
Fuck it.

1303
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,390
Look at that.

1304
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,410
Does absolutely nothing.

1305
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:40,870
Did my job.

1306
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:42,350
Nothing.

1307
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:47,030
I'll do fucking penny.

1308
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:48,590
With my headshot.

1309
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:51,230
It's okay.

1310
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:52,850
I did my job.

1311
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:53,850
Absolutely nothing.

1312
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:55,250
But it's okay.

1313
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,730
I'm farming the damage, though.

1314
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:00,940
It's fine.

1315
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,420
I exist.

1316
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,120
Get in my...

1317
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,040
Get in the Conshu!

1318
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,700
Get in there!

1319
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,020
I don't know what he's doing.

1320
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:14,960
Oh, my god!

1321
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,360
He's having a fisting match!

1322
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,180
Oh, my god!

1323
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:18,980
They're doing it!

1324
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,900
Oh, my god!

1325
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,020
Goodbye.

1326
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,860
Goodbye, me.

1327
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,280
I don't know what's going on.

1328
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,240
But goodbye, me.

1329
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:35,600
Oh,

1330
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:39,780
my god.

1331
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,160
He's still following me!

1332
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,400
Absolutely madman.

1333
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,940
Guys, I don't think the Moon Knight...

1334
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:50,720
I don't know.

1335
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,320
I can't tell.

1336
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,560
Oh, goodbye, everybody.

1337
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,700
I hope you guys are okay.

1338
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:58,240
Oh, nice!

1339
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,020
We used it.

1340
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,720
We used our meal.

1341
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,080
We did it, guys!

1342
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,740
We did it!

1343
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,860
No need to thank me!

1344
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,900
Oh, we did it, everybody!

1345
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,460
We did it, everybody!

1346
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,600
No need to thank me!

1347
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:17,800
Shotguns.

1348
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:18,260
Psylocke?

1349
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,040
But there's nothing new with Psylocke.

1350
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,440
I wanna go a new character.

1351
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,240
I wanna play something new.

1352
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,600
Oh, what the fuck?

1353
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,940
I didn't even see this guy.

1354
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:33,440
Weeeee!

1355
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,360
I'm just like...

1356
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,440
Yippee!

1357
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,040
Let me...

1358
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:40,840
Oh, my god!

1359
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,440
He's on...

1360
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:41,860
Fuck!

1361
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:43,660
Wait, I need to die!

1362
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,640
Oh, my god.

1363
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,520
Oh, my god.

1364
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,800
I'm gonna use my ult and then I leave.

1365
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,260
I need to use my ult so I can leave.

1366
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:55,960
There we go.

1367
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,760
What if I just...

1368
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:58,860
do that?

1369
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,820
Fuck you in general.

1370
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:06,480
Guys, I need him to die!

1371
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:06,900
Please!

1372
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:08,640
Please!

1373
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,040
Kill me so I can go Namor!

1374
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:11,580
Thank god!

1375
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:11,880
Okay.

1376
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,780
No!

1377
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,680
I'm so fucked!

1378
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:16,500
No!

1379
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:21,280
That is the only reason why I did that!

1380
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,220
That's not fair.

1381
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,320
That's actually not fair.

1382
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,080
It's not fair!

1383
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:31,940
That was the only reason why I went forward.

1384
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:34,900
No!

1385
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,240
I'm at 89%!

1386
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,160
Oh, no.

1387
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:38,780
Okay, okay.

1388
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:39,600
Okay.

1389
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,860
The lame rocket.

1390
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,720
I denied him Namor.

1391
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,060
I caught up in Namor.

1392
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,980
What the fuck?

1393
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,800
I caught up in Namor earlier.

1394
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:57,840
Gonshu won't leave me alone!

1395
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,300
Why won't Gonshu free me?

1396
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,040
Free me, Gonshu!

1397
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,810
Yeah, you're scared.

1398
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,290
He's so scared.

1399
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,810
He's so scared of that.

1400
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,370
Did you notice him?

1401
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:28,090
He fucking actually ran off from my squid.

1402
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:31,210
That's right.

1403
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:32,770
It's here.

1404
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:34,990
The ray is here.

1405
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:37,790
He's here now.

1406
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:42,310
Oh, shit.

1407
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:43,390
Oh, no!

1408
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:43,950
No!

1409
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:45,110
No, woman!

1410
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,110
Be gone, woman!

1411
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:51,150
Oh, shit.

1412
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:54,510
Be gone, the ray of death.

1413
01:16:56,350 --> 01:17:00,730
Bro, that Psylocke was so fucking scared of my ray.

1414
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:05,150
He actually, like, was trying so hard to get away.

1415
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:07,330
Be gone, woman!

1416
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:12,150
Oh, my gosh, she tried to pull me forward.

1417
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:15,770
I know I wasted that, but, like, I don't care.

1418
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:18,330
Alright, we still have time.

1419
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:23,590
Protect me.

1420
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:28,730
Yeah, the moment I threw the squid, she disappeared.

1421
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:33,110
Wait, they're still here?

1422
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:36,850
They're still alive?

1423
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:37,810
Don't worry!

1424
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:40,670
What are you gonna do, shoot him?

1425
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:41,830
Oh, they shot him, guys.

1426
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,390
Who would've thought?

1427
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,030
Who would've thought they shot him?

1428
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:49,310
They're so scared of the squid, it's actually crazy.

1429
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:57,170
It's actually crazy how scared they are.

1430
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:02,570
Hey, guys.

1431
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,950
I might need...

1432
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:07,630
I can't make it.

1433
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,790
I can do this.

1434
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:21,670
To be fair, I'm pretty scared, too.

1435
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:24,990
Every time she runs away.

1436
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,210
Yo, Gamma Squid is scarier than Snow Squid.

1437
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:34,170
Cause it does more damage and there's more range to it.

1438
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:38,350
That's why it's scarier.

1439
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:39,750
There's a lot of range.

1440
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,190
Like, I can literally...

1441
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:42,790
I can go, like...

1442
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,110
Wait, I should try the new map.

1443
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:44,530

Everybody's dead anyway.

1576
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:14,290
It's okay.

1577
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:16,350
Everybody's still dead anyway.

1578
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:21,650
It's alright.

1579
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:23,090
Everybody's dead.

1580
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,490
Someone go Hulk.

1586
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,090
The funny silly... Oh my god.

1587
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:42,610
I'm absolutely lost.

1588
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:45,090
Like, there's no sugarcoating it.

1589
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:47,510
I am so confused with this map.

1590
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,750
Okay, here we go.

01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:56,090

1598
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:14,450
Oh my god.

1599
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:17,730
Alright, let me just respawn.

1600
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:22,350
I might need to do raw input for this.

1601
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,070
I don't think I have raw input on default.

1602
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:30,790
Oh fuck, okay.

1603
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:33,930
Oh my god, she has damage reduction.

1604
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,650
I'm hitting diamonds right now.

1605
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:42,430
Oh, where is she?

1606
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:42,870
No!

1607
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:44,350
He fucking dashed away.

1608
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:46,050
That's unlucky.

1609
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:48,790
That's actually so unlucky.

1610
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:50,590
He got a good dash away.

1611
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:57,370
See, that's how you do movement.

1612
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:04,150
Oh my god, that's how you actually move as a raccoon from the shit I saw yesterday.

1613
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:07,490
This guy actually is climbing walls.

1614
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:09,950
Oh my god.

1615
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:11,470
That shit, I'm getting two.

1616
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:20,690
That guy is actually climbing walls instead of standing still.

1617
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:26,510
Okay, no, I'm going to show you guys.

1618
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:27,250
I can't.

1619
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:28,750
I'll show you guys the clip.

1620
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:34,650
I'm going to try my best to censor anything, but I can't.

1621
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:36,190
I have to show you guys what I saw.

1622
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:40,610
It actually is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen.

1623
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:48,050
There was no movement.

1624
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:50,630
She was just standing there.

1625
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:53,770
There was actually no movement whatsoever.

1626
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:59,010
I can't.

1627
01:33:59,070 --> 01:33:59,910
I just couldn't.

1628
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:02,030
No,

1629
01:34:05,330 --> 01:34:06,470
it's really bad.

1630
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:07,490
It's so bad.

1631
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:16,430
Now I see other raccoons that actually fucking climb walls and I'm like, oh my god.

1632
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,030
Alright.

1633
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:23,410
Let's go this way.

1634
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:25,410
How do I have 15 kills?

1635
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:26,850
How do I have the most kills?

1636
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:30,490
I am not trying.

1637
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:33,950
I am not focused at all.

1638
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:35,950
I'm mostly just confused.

1639
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:40,810
Like, where am I?

1640
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,950
Oh my god, which one?

1641
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:50,210
Who did I kill?

1642
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:53,790
Which one?

1643
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:05,330
Okay, there we go.

1644
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:08,050
Who is she mind controlling?

1645
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:09,650
I can't tell.

1646
01:35:09,690 --> 01:35:10,550
Oh, she's dead.

1647
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:12,970
Okay, I was like, who mind control?

1648
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:16,250
Where am I?

1649
01:35:16,730 --> 01:35:18,470
Where am I in Krakoa?

1650
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:20,430
Don't go this way.

1651
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:22,890
Guys, they're all coming here.

1652
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:23,470
Guys!

1653
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:30,830
I was like, there's no way they would go this way, right?

1654
01:35:31,570 --> 01:35:33,070
There's no way.

1655
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:37,150
There's no way.

1656
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:43,830
Out of everywhere they go, they're actually gonna go that way.

1657
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:46,890
I was like, just don't.

1658
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:49,330
There we go.

1659
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:50,270
Oh, shit!

1660
01:35:51,690 --> 01:35:52,070
Leave me alone.

1661
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:53,190
Leave me alone.

1662
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:53,810
Oh!

1663
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:55,630
Goodbye.

1664
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:57,710
Oh, shit!

1665
01:35:58,110 --> 01:35:59,810
They all followed me.

1666
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:00,850
I don't understand.

1667
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:01,990
What am I doing?

1668
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:08,430
They actually all followed me.

1669
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:09,650
Cringe.

1670
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:11,570
Wait, where does this portal take me?

1671
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:13,450
Godslip, they know.

1672
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:14,750
Where am I?

1673
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,070
Oh, these portals.

1674
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,570
There's a dragon?

1675
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:23,370
Where the fuck did that dragon come from?

1676
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:27,390
Oh, shit.

1677
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:31,430
Where are all these things?

1678
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:36,490
Does she know?

1679
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:37,690
Oh, she does.

1680
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:40,850
She does.

1681
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:46,350
Why is there a dragon here?

1682
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:50,550
Hey, guys.

1683
01:36:51,010 --> 01:36:54,010
Oh, wait.

1684
01:36:56,490 --> 01:36:57,490
Can I kill her?

1685
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:58,990
There we go.

1686
01:36:59,170 --> 01:36:59,810
That's all I care.

1687
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:00,210
Oh, wait.

1688
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:01,410
Okay, I'll take that.

1689
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:04,490
Wait, where is he?

1690
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:06,710
Where am I?

1691
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:08,970
That's right.

1692
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:13,320
Please!

1693
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:15,900
Oh my god, I'm killing this rocket.

1694
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,820
I wanna... wait, where's that spider-man?

1695
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,360
That spider-man's not getting healed anymore.

1696
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,420
There we go.

1697
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,780
I literally killed three there.

1698
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:34,620
Yippee!

1699
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:35,560
Am I MVP?

1700
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:36,480
Oh, no!

1701
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,580
They took MVP last second!

1702
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,420
That was... I clutched that, though.

1703
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,520
I actually clutched that.

1704
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,740
I can't believe it.

1705
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,720
I actually clutched that, too.

1706
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:51,900
What?

1707
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,850
How am I nuts?

1708
01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:55,990
What?

1709
01:37:56,690 --> 01:37:58,170
I literally have everything!

1710
01:37:58,530 --> 01:38:00,370
I have everything!

1711
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:08,230
What do you mean?

1712
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:11,410
I always... oh, I forgot to use C so many times.

1713
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:12,430
I'm not used to it.

1714
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:14,630
Actually robbed.

1715
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:16,250
I got robbed.

1716
01:38:17,870 --> 01:38:19,770
I can't believe it.

1717
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:22,350
I got fucking robbed.

1718
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:23,590
Oh, hey, nice.

1719
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:24,210
Look at that.

1720
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:29,320
I got lost too many times.

1721
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:29,800
That's true.

1722
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,400
I was fucking around too many times.

1723
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:36,920
I was running around just exploring.

1724
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,200
Guys, I don't know if I'm gonna make it.

1725
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,200
The fastest hands!

1726
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,760
I locked in.

1727
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,060
There we go.

1728
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:56,500
The fastest hands in the West.

1729
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:00,720
Alright, I don't know how I feel about Coca-Cola.

1730
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,060
There's too many portals.

1731
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,780
I'm just gonna take me out when this map goes into rank.

1732
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,660
Oh my god, I'm gonna be so lost.

1733
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:18,980
Like, all the pro players are gonna theorycraft everything, knowing where to go and everything, and then you have to look at... like, it's so... there's so many passageways.

1734
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,580
Oh my god.

1735
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:24,740
Like, where do I go?

1736
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:27,680
It's so stressful.

1737
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,240
It's actually so stressful.

1738
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:38,580
That's right, now that I'm in Coca-Cola, now I can show my real face.

1739
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:41,900
How I really feel.

1740
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:46,040
They can't kick me out, but I'm here already.

1741
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:47,220
That's right.

1742
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:48,920
What are you gonna do, portal me out?

1743
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,200
Yeah, she's fun.

1744
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,240
She's really fun.

1745
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,880
I find her pretty enjoyable to play in general.

1746
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:58,600
I just don't like this map.

1747
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,700
I don't like this map because it feels like there's a lot going on.

1748
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,120
That's right.

1749
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:09,960
All those apologies, I don't even have a mutant best friend.

1750
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,380
That's right.

1751
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:15,940
That's fucking right.

1752
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,080
I don't even... oh my god.

1753
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:20,820
Okay.

1754
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:25,240
Oh my god, that's fucking right.

1755
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:26,180
I lied.

1756
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,840
I lied about that.

1757
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:34,700
What the fuck am I... dude, we have not enough heals for this.

1758
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:39,040
We... I have not enough heals to flare.

1759
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,080
She lied.

1760
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,200
That's right.

1761
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:46,080
I said it.

1762
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:51,020
I don't even have a best friend who is a mutant.

1763
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:57,540
But I'm a tank, I have to walk in.

1764
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,160
Wait, they have two tanks.

1765
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,080
That's not fair.

1766
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:06,110
That's not fair.

1767
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:08,650
They have two tanks.

1768
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:11,270
How does that happen?

1769
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:13,710
I wanna grab your soul.

1770
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:17,170
Your soul is mine!

1771
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:23,710
Get out of here.

1772
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:24,950
Okay, it doesn't matter.

1773
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,000
Okay.

1774
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:38,520
I'm trying my best here with the situation I'm... I mean, I'm grabbing the soul right now.

1775
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,820
Alright, we definitely need more heals.

1776
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,860
We definitely need more heals.

1777
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,760
This is a little rough.

1778
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,500
It's a little rough.

1779
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,000
The heals are pretty minimal.

1780
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:01,140
Yeah, Rocket's new ult is a defensive ult.

1781
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,340
Now, because he gives armor.

1782
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:10,680
Oh my god, it's okay.

1783
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,260
Maybe with an ult, with the Mantis ult, we can live.

1784
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:20,610
What's crazy is that... get over here.

1785
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:23,750
Oh, he fucking ran away like a little bitch!

1786
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:25,930
Boom!

1787
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:28,130
I don't care if that does nothing.

1788
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:32,330
Okay, I got my... it's alright.

1789
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:34,070
It's okay.

1790
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:35,950
There's the Mantis ult after.

1791
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:42,610
Yeah, we have to actually shoot the Rocket ult now.

1792
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:45,530
It's okay, it's the life I have to live.

1793
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:48,150
It's about sending a message.

1794
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:48,950
Exactly.

1795
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:51,030
He's doing what I was doing last game.

1796
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:53,490
It's about sending that message in.

1797
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:54,950
And I'm scared, personally.

1798
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:58,770
You have a mark on your back or what?

1799
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:06,190
Yeah, the new skins are... I really like... I think like Marble Rivals do skins really, really well in general.

1800
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:09,690
Yeah, I love it.

1801
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:10,890
I love it.

1802
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:24,630
I love it when... but it's also really sad too as a support player that ults and then my tank dies just... but like... but I'll only forgive them if they ulted when I was low HP and you couldn't save me in time.

1803
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:29,770
LMAO!

1804
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:35,950
Five... guys, five gifted if I don't give him Emma.

1805
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:44,640
That's funny.

1806
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:48,680
LMAO!

1807
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:52,020
Alright.

1808
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:55,620
That's funny.

1809
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:57,420
LMAO!

1810
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,540
Make it 50.

1811
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:01,260
Oh, wait.

1812
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,080
We haven't been here before, right?

1813
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,140
This is a new one.

1814
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,480
I don't think he knows who I am.

1815
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:09,540
That's pretty funny.

1816
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,520
LMAO!

1817
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:12,920
Wait, what?

1818
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:14,640
Oh my god!

1819
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:15,900
Okay, I don't like that.

1820
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:19,540
Oh, I missed.

1821
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:20,620
Fuck it.

1822
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,640
I'm like a little scared.

1823
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:25,980
Get over here.

1824
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:28,720
LMAO!

1825
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:30,560
That took you, right?

1826
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:33,400
Your soul is mine!

1827
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:35,100
LMAO!

1828
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:43,000
Your soul is mine!

1829
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:46,300
Mow me off!

1830
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,580
LMAO!

1831
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,840
That's so silly.

1832
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,180
He's that desperate.

1833
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:58,420
Alright, where do we go?

1834
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:02,700
I need to remember to use my... I do not tank at all.

1835
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,260
Like, you know, I just shield.

1836
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:06,440
I was like, no.

1837
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,260
That's my wall!

1838
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:13,540
And I'm dead.

1839
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:17,220
Wait, where's my support?

1840
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:20,280
Wait, where are all of them?

1841
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,600
Where's any...

1842
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,920
Okay, okay, there they are.

1843
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,520
There they are.

1844
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:30,120
I was like, where are they?

1845
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,460
I was literally playing on point.

1846
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:38,060
I was like, I'm playing on point.

1847
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,260
Where did my supports go?

1848
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,080
That's crazy.

1849
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,660
That's actually crazy.

1850
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:48,660
That's so dumb.

1851
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:53,780
Oh, I missed it.

1852
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:54,260
Fuck.

1853
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,940
This is so hard to grab in general.

1854
01:45:58,460 --> 01:45:59,520
Alright, I'm backing up.

1855
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,300
Oh my god, I wanna kill this guy though.

1856
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:06,340
I'm...

1857
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:07,800
LMAO!

1858
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:12,220
Mutant haters don't get healed!

1859
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,320
No, the thing is, I was on point.

1860
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,380
So I was like, how am I not getting healed on the point?

1861
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,100
Like, how is that possible?

1862
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,980
Guys, it's too late.

1863
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:28,500
I'm already in Krakoa.

1864
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,700
They can't just revoke my heal axis.

1865
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,080
My soul!

1866
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:37,840
Boom!

1867
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:41,460
Okay, that was a little fucked up.

1868
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:46,270
Oh.

1869
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:48,110
Hello, woman.

1870
01:46:49,450 --> 01:46:50,090
No,

1871
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:54,170
you do get it.

1872
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:54,590
No.

1873
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:56,570
She doesn't.

1874
01:46:57,070 --> 01:46:57,710
Soul!

1875
01:46:59,530 --> 01:47:00,730
Get grabbed!

1876
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:03,790
Get over here!

1877
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:04,770
Get over here!

1878
01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:05,990
Get over here!

1879
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:07,210
Let me grab you!

1880
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:07,850
No!

1881
01:47:07,850 --> 01:47:07,950
No!

1882
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:12,650
He denied me.

1883
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:14,190
My simple request.

1884
01:47:16,370 --> 01:47:19,150
Dimeye denied me my one thing I wanted.

1885
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:23,370
Where is he?

1886
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:25,870
Where is he?

1887
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:27,630
Where is he?

1888
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:31,150
Look at me!

1889
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:35,370
Look at me.

1890
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:37,690
Like, that was a waste of an ult, but it was worth it.

1891
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:39,830
It was worth it.

1892
01:47:41,810 --> 01:47:43,370
It was so worth it.

1893
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:50,090
Alright.

1894
01:47:52,490 --> 01:47:55,130
Okay, so that was another map we didn't get a chance to play.

1895
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:56,570
I don't like Krakoa.

1896
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:58,570
I hope they deport me.

1897
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:04,930
I don't like this map.

1898
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:07,630
This is not a good domination map.

1899
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:12,730
Get me out of Krakoa.

1900
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:14,950
Get me out of here.

1901
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:16,450
Not again.

1902
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:21,430
It's just not a good...

1903
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:22,630
It's just too confusing.

1904
01:48:22,630 --> 01:48:23,290
It...

1905
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:30,610
This is how you get kicked out.

1906
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:33,030
I want them to kick me out.

1907
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:35,970
It's feeding time.

1908
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:39,790
Citizenship revoked.

1909
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:43,130
I like... I like...

1910
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:44,870
The Bucky one is fun.

1911
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:46,430
I think the Bucky one is good.

1912
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:47,710
And the Yggdrasil.

1913
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:49,730
I like the Bucky and Yggdrasil one.

1914
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:51,930
I don't like... This one just has too many...

1915
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:53,930
This one definitely has so many...

1916
01:48:54,710 --> 01:48:56,230
It has a lot of openings.

1917
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:57,210
Oh shit.

1918
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:58,230
Oh shit.

1919
01:48:59,290 --> 01:48:59,930
Hey guys.

1920
01:49:01,070 --> 01:49:04,030
Okay, I guess I don't get healed?

1921
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:07,210
Hello, I stand in front of you to get healed.

1922
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:09,670
Hello, hello, I'm standing in front of you.

1923
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:10,650
I'm...

1924
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:13,290
Oh my...

1925
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:15,050
Okay.

1926
01:49:15,710 --> 01:49:17,570
That's actually crazy.

1927
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:24,970
That's actually crazy.

1928
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:31,410
The awareness is...

1929
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:33,510
Is interesting.

1930
01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:39,590
I mean, I could help.

1931
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:46,390
Alright, that's fine.

1932
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:49,770
Okay.

1933
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:49,950
Okay.

1934
01:49:50,690 --> 01:49:51,450
Where's Sol?

1935
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:53,490
I want to grab Sol.

1936
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:54,770
Sol!

1937
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:57,350
Oh shit.

1938
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:57,710
Okay.

1939
01:49:58,350 --> 01:49:59,270
That's fine.

1940
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:00,590
That's fine.

1941
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:01,770
I'm impervious too.

1942
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,590
I can grab that?

1943
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:06,750
Nice.

1944
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:08,210
I take that.

1945
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:11,630
Please.

1946
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:12,570
Please help.

1947
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:14,810
There you go.

1948
01:50:15,350 --> 01:50:15,650
Nice.

1949
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:16,290
I'll take it.

1950
01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:18,970
I can grab the spider.

1951
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:19,650
Nice.

1952
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:21,610
I like that.

1953
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:24,310
No spider time for you.

1954
01:50:26,090 --> 01:50:28,610
Wait, I can grab Hulk?

1955
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:29,910
Wait, that's... Oh no.

1956
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:31,130
They don't have Hulk.

1957
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:33,390
They don't have Hulk.

1958
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:34,130
It's worth it.

1959
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:36,610
Listen, what can I do?

1960
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:37,550
I guess this?

1961
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:39,290
What can you do now?

1962
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:44,450
Don't make me grab the Sol.

1963
01:50:47,990 --> 01:50:49,650
Oh shit, I didn't see her.

1964
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:51,790
Don't worry, I got you.

1965
01:50:53,470 --> 01:50:54,970
Okay, goodbye, I guess.

1966
01:50:57,190 --> 01:50:57,750
What?

1967
01:50:58,130 --> 01:51:00,050
Wait, she just... You can just do that?

1968
01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:03,290
That works?

1969
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:05,630
Okay, yeah, I don't like Krakoa.

1970
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:09,490
Yeah, I definitely don't like Krakoa.

1971
01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:13,590
Oh, I missed it.

1972
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:16,630
Um...

1973
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:23,340
Okay, nice.

1974
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:24,880
That's funny.

1975
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:27,960
I'm just fucking meleeing her out.

1976
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,420
Lost fruit.

1977
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,080
Yay!

1978
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:41,400
She hates a living island Krakoa.

1979
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:44,380
A sanctuary for mutants.

1980
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:47,220
Ultron was right.

1981
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:52,300
Can't wait when Ultron comes out.

1982
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:03,530
Toki gets the Utopia.

1983
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:05,030
I hate it here.

1984
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:07,710
Look, there's just too many things.

1985
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:09,870
Alright, we'll do one last.

1986
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:11,130
One more, one more.

1987
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:13,390
You can't just say that.

1988
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:18,430
Hates mutants, goes to mutant island.

1989
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:19,990
I hate it here.

1990
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:28,210
There's just too many.

1991
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:31,210
They're like...

1992
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:33,790
There's just so many openings and portals.

1993
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:35,610
I'm gonna get so lost.

1994
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:39,250
I'll get so lost.

1995
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:45,110
Toki is on Ultron's side.

1996
01:52:46,650 --> 01:52:48,950
Is that what happens if we lose anyway?

1997
01:52:50,730 --> 01:52:53,150
When you lose, you're like...

1998
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:55,490
Ultron, like, destroys Krakoa.

1999
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:03,520
There's too many mutants.

2000
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:06,360
Clink clink.

2001
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,440
It was just like...

2002
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:09,820
There's just so many paths this week.

2003
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:12,740
I think it's also because I don't know the map very well.

2004
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,740
But, like, when we got that...

2005
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:16,640
What was the other map?

2006
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:20,640
What was the other map?

2007
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:24,580
It's the...

2008
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,840
The last new map.

2009
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:28,280
The vampire one, Midtown.

2010
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:33,780
When we got the Central Park one, it was not as confusing when I first started playing.

2011
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:39,980
When I played Central, like, Midtown, Central Park map, it wasn't that confusing to navigate.

2012
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:41,600
But that map?

2013
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:44,520
Krakoa was so confusing to navigate.

2014
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,360
I was, like, lost.

2015
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,200
There were so many openings.

2016
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,740
There were so many openings.

2017
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:54,560
There's portals.

2018
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:56,820
There's, like, different entrances.

2019
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,200
There's flanking spots.

2020
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:02,780
No, Central Park is not as confusing as Krakoa.

2021
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:04,760
Like, Krakoa when I first played it.

2022
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:09,040
Yeah, and there's, like, TPs and everything.

2023
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:10,960
I was just like, where am I?

2024
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:15,140
Oh, man.

2025
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:19,200
I wish someone would play Hulk for me so I can play Neymor.

2026
01:54:23,350 --> 01:54:24,730
Alright, Josh.

2027
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:26,410
Alright, come on.

2028
01:54:27,170 --> 01:54:30,210
Can someone play Hulk for little old me?

2029
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:32,430
For me?

2030
01:54:33,010 --> 01:54:34,110
Come on.

2031
01:54:34,110 --> 01:54:36,030
Just one little Hulk.

2032
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:37,590
Come on.

2033
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:39,630
Hulk?

2034
01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:40,270
Hulk?

2035
01:54:41,490 --> 01:54:42,070
Hulk?

2036
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:48,650
Little Hulky?

2037
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:49,670
Hulky Hulk?

2038
01:54:53,010 --> 01:54:54,030
What do I request?

2039
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:55,870
I never had to request anything before.

2040
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:02,560
Where's Hulk?

2041
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:06,760
Hulk?

2042
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:08,720
Come on.

2043
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:10,040
What did he do to Thor?

2044
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,540
What did he do to him?

2045
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:16,260
I guess no Hulk.

2046
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,160
No Hulk.

2047
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:19,760
What else is new?

2048
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:22,840
No Hulk, guys.

2049
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,680
No Hulk.

2050
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:33,980
No support.

2051
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:35,260
They buffed Hela.

2052
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:39,760
They buffed Hela.

2053
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:41,340
You know what that means.

2054
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:47,460
You know what that means.

2055
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:50,800
I forgot to put raw input.

2056
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:53,560
That's also what that means.

2057
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:55,960
Oh my god.

2058
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,680
I know they buffed...

2059
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:01,400
Jesus Christ.

2060
01:56:05,570 --> 01:56:07,550
I know they buffed like...

2061
01:56:07,550 --> 01:56:08,530
How did they...

2062
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:12,070
Okay, this is not fair.

2063
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:22,110
It's not fair for me to play Hela.

2064
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:31,570
Did someone break this for me?

2065
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:33,510
Guys.

2066
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:35,490
Thank you.

2067
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:40,330
Yeah, I am...

2068
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:42,570
I'm being a little nuisance right now.

2069
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:46,070
I'm being a little nuisance.

2070
01:56:51,670 --> 01:56:52,310
Guys.

2071
01:56:53,110 --> 01:56:54,930
Oh, I don't have my...

2072
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:55,550
It's fine.

2073
01:56:55,790 --> 01:56:56,710
Oh, it's not fine.

2074
01:56:57,130 --> 01:56:58,490
Let me...

2075
01:56:58,490 --> 01:57:00,730
Okay, I realized what I don't have.

2076
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:05,170
Where's my need healing?

2077
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:05,950
There we go.

2078
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:07,550
Now I can just spam that.

2079
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:08,510
Whippy!

2080
01:57:08,990 --> 01:57:10,110
With my one support.

2081
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,110
It was not fine.

2082
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:13,810
I killed the guy that tried to kill me.

2083
01:57:15,310 --> 01:57:16,210
There we go.

2084
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:20,650
I mean, Hela is just literally point and click adventure.

2085
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:23,490
She's not like actual like...

2086
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:26,190
She's like point and click.

2087
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:29,350
Like...

2088
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:30,610
I just gotta click.

2089
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:31,870
That's really it.

2090
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:33,870
That's Hela.

2091
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:36,130
The moment I click, it's fine.

2092
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:40,190
What if I just...

2093
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:43,310
Yes.

2094
01:57:44,990 --> 01:57:45,470
Okay.

2095
01:57:46,110 --> 01:57:46,490
Sure.

2096
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:51,730
Guys, I'm gonna die the moment I'm out of here.

2097
01:57:52,490 --> 01:57:53,150
Oh, okay.

2098
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:55,330
I'm fine with that.

2099
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:59,350
Please tell me I make it.

2100
01:57:59,350 --> 01:58:00,610
Oh, thank you.

2101
01:58:03,710 --> 01:58:05,610
Thank you, guys.

2102
01:58:06,130 --> 01:58:09,110
I actually really appreciate the boop.

2103
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:10,510
Thanks.

2104
01:58:12,190 --> 01:58:13,910
Thanks for the boop, guys.

2105
01:58:16,190 --> 01:58:19,290
He booped me back into it.

2106
01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:20,390
That's crazy.

2107
01:58:21,210 --> 01:58:22,630
I appreciate the help.

2108
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:27,410
I really appreciate it.

2109
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:29,450
What a nice mag.

2110
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:31,330
Helping you get in ult.

2111
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:34,170
He had the mag save.

2112
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:38,410
Rich mag me.

2113
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:43,730
Oh no, the clones can't double meteor.

2114
01:58:43,970 --> 01:58:45,110
Clones can't double ult.

2115
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:46,310
It's just...

2116
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:48,370
It's just like attacks and shield.

2117
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:50,190
Like...

2118
01:58:50,190 --> 01:58:51,330
Attacks and abilities.

2119
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:53,250
Just no ults.

2120
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:55,790
Yay, my hero!

2121
01:58:56,650 --> 01:58:57,830
Alright, what else did they do?

2122
01:58:59,010 --> 01:58:59,530
They...

2123
01:58:59,530 --> 01:59:00,690
Did they do anything else?

2124
01:59:01,110 --> 01:59:01,890
Any other character?

2125
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:05,450
They did stuff with Mr. Fantastic, but that's not as fun.

2126
01:59:11,310 --> 01:59:13,670
I think he got tired of playing Emma.

2127
01:59:14,810 --> 01:59:15,730
Alright, guys.

2128
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:16,670
Maybe...

2129
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:18,170
Alright, we'll do one more after this.

2130
01:59:18,210 --> 01:59:19,450
I wanna play Namor.

2131
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:21,790
I want someone to do Namor.

2132
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:23,130
I wanna play Namor.

2133
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:24,610
Give me the Raze!

2134
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:26,790
No, Mr. Fantastic.

2135
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:29,310
I'll never be a good melee player.

2136
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:31,530
I'm so bad at...

2137
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:33,590
I'm so bad at melee characters.

2138
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:35,630
I say it like...

2139
01:59:35,630 --> 01:59:37,030
As hype fucking played King.

2140
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:41,370
I feel like it's different.

2141
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:44,310
It's different.

2142
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:44,810
Like...

2143
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:46,110
Oh my god!

2144
01:59:46,430 --> 01:59:47,870
That was a lot of ults.

2145
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:51,150
I literally showed up just to get like fucked up.

2146
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:54,810
That was a lot.

2147
01:59:56,030 --> 01:59:56,790
It's different.

2148
01:59:58,370 --> 01:59:59,710
They changed Scarlet Witch a lot.

2149
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:01,610
Yeah, but they already took Scarlet Witch.

2150
02:00:02,790 --> 02:00:03,730
And there's no Strange.

2151
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,330
I don't wanna play Scarlet Witch without a Strange.

2152
02:00:06,390 --> 02:00:07,190
It's not fun.

2153
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:15,310
I feel like the fun part is the Strange though.

2154
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:17,230
Come over.

2155
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:17,730
Come on.

2156
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:18,970
I know you're scared.

2157
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:20,310
Oh, you're so...

2158
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:22,850
You're so scared.

2159
02:00:25,170 --> 02:00:25,930
Oh no.

2160
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:26,970
Wait.

2161
02:00:27,050 --> 02:00:28,690
Nobody destroyed this.

2162
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:31,110
Nobody destroyed it.

2163
02:00:33,930 --> 02:00:34,970
Oh my god.

2164
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:36,310
They're just healing each other.

2165
02:00:39,090 --> 02:00:40,330
Oh my god.

2166
02:00:40,670 --> 02:00:42,270
Oh my god.

2167
02:00:43,110 --> 02:00:44,370
They're just healing each other.

2168
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:45,210
That's illegal.

2169
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:47,270
Please.

2170
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:50,410
Jesus Christ.

2171
02:00:52,030 --> 02:00:52,730
Please.

2172
02:00:52,850 --> 02:00:53,550
What's hitting?

2173
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:55,410
Oh, she was behind me?

2174
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:56,650
I was like, what's...

2175
02:00:57,410 --> 02:00:58,710
Where is she?

2176
02:00:59,070 --> 02:01:00,570
I didn't know where she was.

2177
02:01:01,090 --> 02:01:02,630
I was so confused.

2178
02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:06,230
I couldn't find where she was.

2179
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:08,210
I was like, I see the...

2180
02:01:08,210 --> 02:01:10,450
I see the trail of red.

2181
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:12,750
But like, where is she like sucking?

2182
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:16,570
Where is she giving the suck?

2183
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:20,850
Oh, they're running.

2184
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:22,650
So I left now too.

2185
02:01:23,830 --> 02:01:25,530
I could just flank, I guess.

2186
02:01:30,090 --> 02:01:31,090
Unlucky for them.

2187
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:36,250
Oh, okay.

2188
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:36,910
Nevermind.

2189
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:39,310
Okay, nevermind.

2190
02:01:41,710 --> 02:01:43,190
Oh wait, why is she...

2191
02:01:43,190 --> 02:01:45,790
I was like, why is she out of there?

2192
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:47,690
How are you getting out?

2193
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:49,570
Goodbye.

2194
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:52,350
Put me back in.

2195
02:01:55,090 --> 02:01:56,870
Come on, put me back in here, coach.

2196
02:01:58,790 --> 02:02:00,150
Put me back in, coach.

2197
02:02:01,530 --> 02:02:02,590
Oh, I hit her.

2198
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:03,650
Wait, did you guys see that?

2199
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:06,930
I gave a shot.

2200
02:02:09,890 --> 02:02:11,570
Alright, back up I go.

2201
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:12,550
Oh shit!

2202
02:02:16,090 --> 02:02:17,830
Oh my gosh, he was one.

2203
02:02:18,490 --> 02:02:19,430
He was actually one.

2204
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:21,690
I'm sad.

2205
02:02:24,970 --> 02:02:26,350
Oh no, he's back.

2206
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:31,030
Oh, I missed it.

2207
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:31,590
No!

2208
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:32,830
Goodbye.

2209
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:37,740
Oh, I need...

2210
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:39,460
I wanna put raw input so badly.

2211
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:42,320
I'm so used to aiming with raw input.

2212
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,480
Cause like, raw input is like slower too.

2213
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:49,740
It's like a little slower than...

2214
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:51,600
normal...

2215
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:53,240
than regular aim.

2216
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,900
Like, I'm a little not used to it.

2217
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:57,900
I can't!

2218
02:02:57,940 --> 02:03:00,840
I wanna use Emma Frost, but I can't!

2219
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:04,160
I hear somebody.

2220
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:08,960
Alright, let's see.

2221
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:09,980
Where is it?

2222
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:15,060
Keyboard...

2223
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:15,960
Where is it?

2224
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:16,580
Which one is it?

2225
02:03:16,580 --> 02:03:18,520
Another epic victory!

2226
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:19,400
Thanks!

2227
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:21,340
Spider...

2228
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:24,700
I can tell that Spider-Man doesn't play Spider-Man.

2229
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:27,180
I think like, they play...

2230
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:27,520
Oh my...

2231
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:29,940
Okay, me and Joss were farming damage so much.

2232
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,340
That Spider-Man...

2233
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:34,320
Like, their main character was definitely not Spider-Man.

2234
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:35,680
They did not know what the fuck they were doing.

2235
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:36,360
They...

2236
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:41,060
They actually did not know how to play that character.

2237
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:45,080
Alright, there's no way he was a Spider-Player.

2238
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:46,760
Oh, come on, get me in.

2239
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:48,280
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in.

2240
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,140
Oh, it's Midtown!

2241
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:55,020
I'm fast!

2242
02:03:59,240 --> 02:03:59,520
Yeah!

2243
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:02,180
The fastest hands!

2244
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:07,830
The fastest hands!

2245
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:09,370
I was like, trying to figure out where it is.

2246
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:12,010
Midtown Central Park.

2247
02:04:12,670 --> 02:04:15,350
No, Midtown Central Park aren't that difficult!

2248
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:20,990
When they first came out, I never got as confused as I did versus Krakoa.

2249
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:24,770
Yeah, I spent more money on my PC.

2250
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:28,770
Actually, I spent less money on my PC because I got this one for free.

2251
02:04:32,690 --> 02:04:34,690
No, it says not Doki Bird.

2252
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:37,550
Doki Bird, is that you?

2253
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:40,910
It says not Doki Bird!

2254
02:04:48,950 --> 02:04:52,570
It clearly says it's not!

2255
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:59,490
Common mistake, guys.

2256
02:05:00,010 --> 02:05:01,030
It's common.

2257
02:05:06,730 --> 02:05:07,210
No.

2258
02:05:09,430 --> 02:05:12,790
I'm here to roleplay as Emma Frost and I say no.

2259
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:16,710
Alright, let's go here.

2260
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,730
Make sure you flank here so I'm like...

2261
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:22,590
There's nobody here.

2262
02:05:22,990 --> 02:05:24,210
Where are they?

2263
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:32,270
Oh my god.

2264
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:33,810
Wait, where's my supports?

2265
02:05:34,190 --> 02:05:34,490
Okay.

2266
02:05:37,450 --> 02:05:39,640
I got her solo, but...

2267
02:05:40,150 --> 02:05:40,970
I'm solo.

2268
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:43,490
Wait, there are supports there?

2269
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:45,450
Oh my god!

2270
02:05:45,450 --> 02:05:48,610
I did such a good ambush and everything!

2271
02:05:49,030 --> 02:05:50,290
Oh, they're running triple.

2272
02:05:50,290 --> 02:05:51,730
Wait, they only have one support.

2273
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:52,790
We just killed their support.

2274
02:05:53,390 --> 02:05:54,630
It's just that easy.

2275
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:57,930
Wait, I'm just gonna fucking find their Luna.

2276
02:05:59,110 --> 02:06:00,310
Actually, we just...

2277
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:11,430
Oh my god, I couldn't get to him.

2278
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:13,830
That's unlucky.

2279
02:06:16,290 --> 02:06:17,890
Oh my god, that's unlucky.

2280
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:20,330
We literally just need to kill their Luna.

2281
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:23,310
I don't even know what that person said.

2282
02:06:26,170 --> 02:06:28,050
Oh, we almost got the Luna!

2283
02:06:29,390 --> 02:06:31,230
No, I'm not even solo tanking.

2284
02:06:33,970 --> 02:06:35,970
Literally, that's all we have to do.

2285
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:41,490
Oh, I missed it.

2286
02:06:42,590 --> 02:06:44,310
I missed it, but that's fine.

2287
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:48,550
It's fine.

2288
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:53,480
Get that soul!

2289
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,440
Yoink!

2290
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:56,940
Yoink!

2291
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:58,780
Oh yeah, you're my shield.

2292
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:02,440
Oh yeah, guys.

2293
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:06,660
I forgot about the most important...

2294
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:11,680
Goodbye!

2295
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,420
I keep forgetting the most important part, the shield.

2296
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:18,680
Alright.

2297
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:20,440
Alright, I'm a tank.

2298
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:26,940
What the fuck?

2299
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:32,010
Oh wait, did you guys see that?

2300
02:07:33,830 --> 02:07:34,510
Wait!

2301
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:36,710
Wait, did you...

2302
02:07:36,710 --> 02:07:38,310
I blocked it!

2303
02:07:39,550 --> 02:07:41,670
Wait, you can block it!

2304
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:47,110
Wait, you can shift...

2305
02:07:47,110 --> 02:07:48,370
You can shift the...

2306
02:07:48,370 --> 02:07:49,430
Wait!

2307
02:07:49,850 --> 02:07:52,190
You can shift the thingle...

2308
02:07:52,190 --> 02:07:54,230
With the diamond.

2309
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:58,810
Yeah, I negated thingle.

2310
02:07:59,090 --> 02:08:00,170
That's actually crazy.

2311
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:01,650
I was not expecting that.

2312
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:06,430
I did not expect that at all.

2313
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:10,230
Yeah, that's really strong.

2314
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:13,590
That's actually really strong.

2315
02:08:15,590 --> 02:08:17,350
I was not prepared.

2316
02:08:20,330 --> 02:08:24,100
Oh, it's fine.

2317
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:27,040
I have nearly Luna ult to save myself from it.

2318
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:29,940
My turn!

2319
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:39,440
So now there's two tanks that can...

2320
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:41,440
That can...

2321
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:42,220
What's the word?

2322
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:44,240
Block the thing.

2323
02:08:46,580 --> 02:08:47,640
That's actually crazy.

2324
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:49,160
I was not expecting that.

2325
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:50,760
Yeah, so like...

2326
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:52,240
Only two tanks can do it.

2327
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:52,600
It's literally...

2328
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:54,520
Strange and...

2329
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,160
Strange and MNL.

2330
02:08:58,680 --> 02:09:00,580
Because in the past, there's only been...

2331
02:09:00,580 --> 02:09:01,640
Okay, there's like...

2332
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:02,540
This guy right here, yeah.

2333
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:05,980
Yeah, I went for it here.

2334
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:11,060
That's mine, right?

2335
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:14,340
Okay.

2336
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,380
I mean, there's like nothing I can do right now.

2337
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:28,580
There's nothing I can do.

2338
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:29,500
I'm just...

2339
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,020
I'm just Emma Frost.

2340
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:39,110
Fucking weak.

2341
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:48,440
I save you now!

2342
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:55,890
Don't worry...

2343
02:09:55,890 --> 02:09:56,290
No!

2344
02:09:56,510 --> 02:09:57,290
I wanted to...

2345
02:09:57,290 --> 02:09:59,170
No, I almost got the Luna.

2346
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:01,430
Oh, they went double support now.

2347
02:10:01,910 --> 02:10:03,170
They're double support.

2348
02:10:06,350 --> 02:10:07,350
Oh, man!

2349
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:08,750
I was like gonna be like...

2350
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:09,310
That's right!

2351
02:10:09,550 --> 02:10:10,970
Got you now!

2352
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:14,390
I fucking got you now!

2353
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:19,790
Damn, he got saved so hard.

2354
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:20,490
That's...

2355
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:22,290
Actually crazy though that you can...

2356
02:10:24,230 --> 02:10:24,570
Oink.

2357
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:27,510
I'm better.

2358
02:10:30,050 --> 02:10:31,010
I'm better.

2359
02:10:38,580 --> 02:10:40,140
Okay, where is this?

2360
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:42,160
There you go.

2361
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:44,980
I don't think they know that I can cancel that.

2362
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:49,860
Oink by Krista.

2363
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:52,520
Where is he?

2364
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:55,460
I'm trying to get to him.

2365
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:58,780
Oh my god.

2366
02:10:58,840 --> 02:10:59,900
I barely do...

2367
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:01,460
Okay, we gotta get this guy.

2368
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:07,250
Jesus Christ.

2369
02:11:07,470 --> 02:11:08,970
We need more damage.

2370
02:11:09,670 --> 02:11:12,030
I am not doing enough damage.

2371
02:11:13,290 --> 02:11:13,510
Yeah.

2372
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:15,890
Training is gonna have PTSD.

2373
02:11:17,590 --> 02:11:18,870
Holy shit.

2374
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:22,910
It's just me hitting.

2375
02:11:23,050 --> 02:11:24,870
I'm just pummeling people.

2376
02:11:24,870 --> 02:11:27,150
I need to remember that...

2377
02:11:27,150 --> 02:11:30,910
When I charge up my left click, I have to press E.

2378
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:36,310
But the shield counters strange ult.

2379
02:11:36,410 --> 02:11:36,610
Yeah.

2380
02:11:37,290 --> 02:11:38,490
Okay, I'm gonna wait.

2381
02:11:39,490 --> 02:11:40,350
I hear her.

2382
02:11:44,010 --> 02:11:45,170
Okay, you're...

2383
02:11:45,170 --> 02:11:46,530
I'm just gonna say it now.

2384
02:11:46,850 --> 02:11:48,640
But I don't think our...

2385
02:11:53,190 --> 02:11:55,270
He's definitely not good.

2386
02:11:56,530 --> 02:11:56,730
Hey.

2387
02:11:59,650 --> 02:12:00,230
Okay.

2388
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:01,730
That's fine.

2389
02:12:02,590 --> 02:12:03,530
I'm gonna...

2390
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:05,210
There we go.

2391
02:12:07,370 --> 02:12:09,870
I need to do more damage on this because of it.

2392
02:12:09,890 --> 02:12:10,330
Yeah, I do.

2393
02:12:13,590 --> 02:12:14,810
Okay, that's fine.

2394
02:12:17,130 --> 02:12:17,970
That's fine.

2395
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:23,680
Come on.

2396
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:25,640
Come on.

2397
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:26,900
Yeah, Luna.

2398
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:27,740
Yeah.

2399
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:30,580
You too.

2400
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:35,590
There you go.

2401
02:12:36,210 --> 02:12:37,870
Get over here.

2402
02:12:42,570 --> 02:12:44,330
There you go.

2403
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:46,010
I blocked it.

2404
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:50,830
I literally cancelled the clobber.

2405
02:12:51,310 --> 02:12:51,950
Did I see that?

2406
02:12:52,610 --> 02:12:54,590
That's actually crazy that that...

2407
02:12:55,470 --> 02:12:57,430
That that's a thing I can do.

2408
02:12:59,610 --> 02:13:01,110
I can't get out of here too.

2409
02:13:01,170 --> 02:13:01,970
That's the worst part.

2410
02:13:07,850 --> 02:13:09,130
Oh, I missed it though.

2411
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:13,150
Okay.

2412
02:13:14,330 --> 02:13:16,150
Alright, this is the best I can do.

2413
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:21,510
I'm just...

2414
02:13:22,030 --> 02:13:23,190
I'm just beaming.

2415
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:25,050
There you go.

2416
02:13:27,850 --> 02:13:28,610
Okay, nice.

2417
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:33,070
Oh, fuck.

2418
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:33,750
I missed it.

2419
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:35,810
Come on, get down.

2420
02:13:35,810 --> 02:13:36,570
You have to get down.

2421
02:13:39,310 --> 02:13:40,810
I know you have to get down.

2422
02:13:46,690 --> 02:13:47,970
Get out of here.

2423
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:53,720
Jesus Christ, this is just a ball stage.

2424
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:57,260
This is actually just brawling.

2425
02:13:58,060 --> 02:13:58,580
Oh.

2426
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:09,770
No, I tried to stand around it.

2427
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:12,710
I dodged everything.

2428
02:14:13,270 --> 02:14:14,990
It's literally just me brawling.

2429
02:14:16,630 --> 02:14:20,330
Jesus Christ, I did so much too.

2430
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:24,970
I did so much there.

2431
02:14:25,150 --> 02:14:26,850
Oh my god.

2432
02:14:29,610 --> 02:14:33,230
I blocked so much and I did so much.

2433
02:14:34,510 --> 02:14:35,030
Alright.

2434
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:38,130
I don't think I'm gonna get a chance to play anymore.

2435
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:39,270
But that was fun.

2436
02:14:39,590 --> 02:14:40,810
That was really fun.

2437
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:45,690
Yeah, I had to get a confirmed kill.

2438
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:47,490
But I literally was like...

2439
02:14:51,770 --> 02:14:53,270
That was fun though.

2440
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:54,150
I had a great time.

2441
02:14:55,190 --> 02:14:56,490
The fact that...

2442
02:14:57,450 --> 02:14:59,070
No, her ult was fucking shit.

2443
02:14:59,190 --> 02:15:00,490
I blocked two of her...

2444
02:15:00,490 --> 02:15:02,670
I blocked two of the Scarlet's ult.

2445
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:06,030
But I placed my shield wrong for the third one.

2446
02:15:07,190 --> 02:15:08,950
I actually cancelled...

2447
02:15:08,950 --> 02:15:09,850
I cancelled Strange...

2448
02:15:09,850 --> 02:15:19,770
I literally cancelled Strange, Emma, Thing and Scarlet Witch ult with just my Command Grab.

2449
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:24,950
My Command Grab, my Diamond Form and my shield.

2450
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:29,810
That's crazy how many things I can cancel with just one character.

2451
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:36,670
I did not realize that you can block Strange ult with Emma's Diamond Form.

2452
02:15:36,850 --> 02:15:38,910
That's actually insane.

2453
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:42,830
Oh my god.

2454
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:46,030
That's wild that I can do that.

2455
02:15:46,030 --> 02:15:48,030
Because like I said...

2456
02:15:51,330 --> 02:15:55,470
Only Strange can block the thing for his ult.

2457
02:15:55,690 --> 02:15:57,330
Now it's Emma and Strange.

2458
02:15:57,890 --> 02:16:00,670
That's good because nothing else could block it.

2459
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:01,970
Only Strange could block it before.

2460
02:16:02,330 --> 02:16:04,910
And then Strange, you have to time the shield too.

2461
02:16:05,210 --> 02:16:07,070
You have to time the shield correctly.

2462
02:16:07,510 --> 02:16:08,330
Look down.

2463
02:16:08,650 --> 02:16:09,910
Position your shield down.

2464
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:13,110
And then cancel the ult.

2465
02:16:13,110 --> 02:16:15,610
But Emma, I literally just press Shift.

2466
02:16:17,390 --> 02:16:20,790
I just press Shift.

2467
02:16:20,950 --> 02:16:21,770
It's so easy.

2468
02:16:22,190 --> 02:16:24,990
And the fact that I can Command Grab his ult too is crazy.

2469
02:16:25,290 --> 02:16:28,790
I think I can Command Grab cancel any ult if I time it correctly.

2470
02:16:29,930 --> 02:16:31,050
I'm pretty sure.

2471
02:16:31,170 --> 02:16:36,510
Because if I can Command Grab and stop the Thing's ult, that means I can do that and cancel any other ult.

2472
02:16:37,230 --> 02:16:40,230
Any other interruption and stuff.

2473
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:42,590
But Command Grab is really fun.

2474
02:16:43,850 --> 02:16:45,510
But yeah, that was really fun.

2475
02:16:45,710 --> 02:16:48,190
I really enjoyed testing out the new season today.

2476
02:16:49,290 --> 02:16:50,890
The Early Access for everybody.

2477
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:55,330
I hope you guys had a great time watching the Early Access.

2478
02:16:55,730 --> 02:16:58,410
And I got to actually play Emma Frost for a lot.

2479
02:16:58,810 --> 02:17:00,730
I got to play Namor like one time.

2480
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:08,030
But yeah, thank you everybody.

2481
02:17:09,170 --> 02:17:18,610
Thank you to the Rivals for giving me Early Access and being able to explore and theorycraft and getting to experience.

2482
02:17:18,830 --> 02:17:19,430
Oh, he knows.

2483
02:17:19,490 --> 02:17:20,510
He knows it's feeding time.

2484
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:22,850
He knows when I do my editing.

2485
02:17:23,070 --> 02:17:23,590
I'm sorry.

2486
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:24,230
I will.

2487
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:25,170
Hey guys.

2488
02:17:25,590 --> 02:17:25,790
Peace.

2489
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:26,190
Hunky.

2490
02:17:26,590 --> 02:17:27,590
As always everybody.

2491
02:17:28,490 --> 02:17:29,370
Stay hydrated.

2492
02:17:29,590 --> 02:17:30,110
Posture check.

2493
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:32,130
Get up and run around to get that blood flowing.

2494
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:33,370
And you can stay up for me.

2495
02:17:33,510 --> 02:17:34,110
Head to bed.

2496
02:17:34,210 --> 02:17:35,450
Because you deserve it.

2497
02:17:35,550 --> 02:17:36,750
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2498
02:17:37,130 --> 02:17:37,870
Bye guys.

2499
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:38,530
Bye.
