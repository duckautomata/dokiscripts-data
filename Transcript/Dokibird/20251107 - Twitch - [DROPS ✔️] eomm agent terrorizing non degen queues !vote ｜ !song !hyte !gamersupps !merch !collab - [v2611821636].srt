00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,970
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,670
Hello, hello.

3
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,310
So, Diane wants to get out of my room.

4
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,430
Right?

5
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:49,970
Okay.

6
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,830
Nope, you're not allowed back in.

7
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,830
If I sound sad slash tired, I am both.

8
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,450
I had a really rough day today, which is why I'm streaming.

9
00:04:00,990 --> 00:05:12,650
I'm streaming today, because even though it is my rest day, the one thing that I know that cheers me up the most is hanging out with my dragons, make me feel a lot better so um there's a lot of stuff that happened today but one of the things that happened recently was that um dad couldn't get his um uh dad couldn't get his uh refill on his kidney medication today because i was waiting for the refill too at my vet because like they're like we're gonna order the we're gonna order the medication for you and i waited like so yeah it has a couple of days now um and then like they're like we have to order it because i didn't want to do like an emergency order from the hospital uh because it costs more so i was like okay he can go about his medication for a couple of days because i ran out um and uh so i they for some reason the vet he's fine still i mean he's still a fucking brat he's fine i hope i i think so um but um anyway like,

10
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,630
uh, and then I was like, that's weird.

11
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,610
They said he'll, how he get his medication, like, you know, the, like, in like two to three days.

12
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,590
And I was like, it's more than two to three days.

13
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,970
So then, to women.

14
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,250
Black, yeah, thank you, material, awesome.

15
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,710
Thank you.

16
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,490
Thank you.

17
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:37,710
Um, and then, like, uh, today I got a call from my vet, and they were like, um, so we received the medication.

18
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,730
Like, we ordered your medication, but like, we don't have the prescription.

19
00:05:41,730 --> 00:06:41,610
description to give you this medication so what's up with that and i was just like what because and then so that was like i had i left the voicemail i called them back and then i left the voicemail and because they're like we can't give you the medication so that we figured this out and the thing is the when i called them back they're like there's nobody there at the receptionist so please leave a voicemail but like the vet didn't close until two hours so i was just like what and then so I called them like four times I left a voicemail and I called them like four times around those two hours and never received like I never received a call back so I was just like okay what the fuck so after the vet closed I called the hospital I called a hospital it was like can I get emergency refill because at that point I was like I don't want to wait any longer so I was like um can I get an emergency can I go emergency refill because like for some reason you guys said you sent the medical records to

20
00:06:41,610 --> 00:07:36,650
my vet and i've called you three to four times to send the medical records to my vet but they still haven't received it so i'm fucking confused they received the medical records for his like back surgery and they have the records of that but they don't have the records for his kidney shit so i was so fucking confused i was just like calling them i was just like hey so um so can you please like send them the medical records and they're like and then like I called they called me back like oh we did send them the medical records I was like are you sure like yeah we received the back stuff but what about the kidney stuff like I don't know why they still haven't received the kidney medical records so they're like oh we'll send it again and then they're like so about the emergency refill uh you missed the appointment um in August so we can't do an

21
00:07:39,690 --> 00:08:52,850
what I don't remember that but I don't know I guess that happened but I was just like but I got an emergency refill last month I was just like what I got an emergency refill last month what do you mean they're fucking counting my August appointment date so they're like yeah so um I don't know fucking no I guess like the other receptionist I called like three times before it get an emergency refill like they didn't care but this one cared this one cared so they were like um um so i was just like oh so i need to get a recheck up to get his emergency refill and they're like yeah but internal medicine they're closed right they're like you know they're not there right now so you got but we'll leave a voicemail for you so you can get a recheck up uh for it the thing this is a hospital like it is an emergency vet hospital so it's not like it's like a vet vet it's like a 24-hour emergency vet hospital for he got his back surgery and we got diagnosed for his kidney troubles so um so i was just

22
00:08:52,850 --> 00:09:05,390
like oh um when can i get the next appointment because he needs his kidney medication and they're like well um you could take him in through emergency

23
00:09:09,390 --> 00:10:23,520
for an emergency checkup and maybe you can get your emergency medication by the way the emergency checkup is like 300 plus dollars so i was just like what the i was just like oh my god and like and they look at it via you know i don't remember what it's called um they look at it like because he doesn't i can't like i know i should get pen insurance but it's or he already got diagnosed for like for a thing so it's like a lot harder i'd like to get the insured like i know i should look into it but like um anyway anyway so um so they're so they're like yeah you can bring him in at any time because it is 24 hours for the emergency vet um and that doesn't include the refill too by the way because the emergency checkup is like 200 to 300 plus dollars yeah because insurance doesn't yeah do much after he got diagnosed for his kidney stuff um so so i was just like i was just like oh okay and they're like yeah you can bring him in whatever for emergency by the way i've been to emergency before

24
00:10:23,520 --> 00:11:33,380
for emergency event and like i waited there for two like two plus hours depending on like and then the thing is so i'm waiting i'm gonna stream until it's later because at this time I know there's there's still going to be looking at like dogs so at other patients because like they're they do it via tears you know like the what's the medical tier like we're like they look at which one is the most severe like the most severe case and then it goes down and like you know dad uh that the tri-triag I don't know how to pronounce it so I'll go over there at a later time that's why I'm also streaming um because I like if I go there now I'm pretty sure it'll take a while for them to see dad because like at this time you know like there's gonna be a lot of patients um in emergency and like because dad is only like looking at his like checking like I guess like the I forgot like the um testing the kidney and stuff um so they don't see that as like super urgent too because he's getting a

25
00:11:33,380 --> 00:12:09,600
re-checkup for it just to be like okay how like do we continue the medication but the thing is they literally told when they prescribed me the medication they're like yeah he's gotta be on it forever like so i'm like why do i need to re-check up if he's gonna be on that fucking medication for the rest of his goddamn life like i just i don't understand they're like yeah he's gotta do a recheckup before we can prescribe him new like pre-prescribe him the medication but i was like bro you said you said he's gonna be on this medication for the rest of his fucking life

26
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,780
like is it gonna be like magically gonna be better

27
00:12:23,800 --> 00:13:22,940
like it's for the dosage yeah like the thing they're like oh if it gets worse and you give him more of the dosage i i would know that part but like the last when i was there like because this would be his second checkup because like he has that no he yeah yeah he has that like no his third checkup because he had like two other checkups and they're like yeah we keep the dose the same like nothing seems to be wrong we'll keep it the same um um so no the thing is it doesn't go less they said like oh this is like the dose the average dosage like like they we don't minimize that it's like if it gets worse he gets more dosage so like that's why i'm like really worried about because like it's been like a couple of days now since he skipped the medication so like i've got god i'm starting to get a little worried so well not a little because that's why i was like really like sad like because i was just like oh my god like i thought i could like i was just like oh my god i didn't want to pay for

28
00:13:22,940 --> 00:14:49,700
the emergency room for and then like and now i'm like going through all of that yeah um um so so that's why i'm also streaming so i could pass the time to wait until it's a lot later so i could take i have to take him to emergency i have to take him to emergency uh to like uh to like uh get his uh prescription um he's like he if you look at him you'll be like oh he's bald but also he sees a very he seems like a very healthy dog he has too much energy and like he has a lot of fucking energy um it's just the fact that like uh he does have like kidney like um he does have like kidney issues where i don't remember what i don't remember what exactly he has they're just like we got he's got to be on his medication for the rest of his life and i was like okay okay um i don't know i think you guys might remember but like i've sort of like i've sort of like blocked that part out of my head and i've just like you know just been yeah oh yeah digesting protein yeah yeah it's like he has apparently

29
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,180
issues, uh, he's like peeing too much of his protein out.

30
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,560
Um, so that's what, um, that's what it's for, basically, is to make him make sure to keep the protein in his kidneys.

31
00:15:04,720 --> 00:16:52,060
Um, uh, so yeah, so I'm gonna go take dad to the emergency later, later tonight, so he can uh, get his medication and, uh, God, we all love him, but holy fuck, man like i'm sorry he is um he is an example of why purebred dogs are slowly becoming a problem he he is so expensive like he is absolutely i would say a genetic mess and i say that with love with a lot of love but by god he is absolutely a example of royalty the issues the issue of being royalty you know when he was a puppy he seemed okay also oh my god thank you so much for the great thank you thank you uh alec alec thank you so much i hope you had a good stream today i'm trying to pass the time and try to keep my mind off things by playing some rivals at a decently appropriate time at a decent time versus versus my usual degenerate hours um whatever happens win or loss um um whatever i don't care i don't care I'm just here to be my,

32
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,020
like, be your usual E-O-M-M agent.

33
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,400
What time do you plan on going?

34
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:06,680
I plan on going maybe around midnight because usually that's when, I don't know, that's when, like, I don't know.

35
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,220
Maybe there's less emergencies going on at midnight.

36
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,220
I don't fucking know.

37
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:20,480
The last time I was there was like, it took me like two to three hours to be seen.

38
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,720
So I was just like, I was like, I'm not, I'm, I'm waiting.

39
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,640
I'm waiting.

40
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:42,740
Like, dad, you can, you're just going to get, you can get your, your kidney medication, like a little later because it's like, I, we're just going to be waiting there anyway.

41
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,540
If I, it's going to be, I know like at this time, there's going to be a lot of people there.

42
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,260
Do a face reveal?

43
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,040
I'll pay you.

44
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,860
Pay me first.

45
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,080
Prove it.

46
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,360
Pay me first, night.

47
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,000
Come on.

48
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,220
I'm waiting.

49
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,440
Yeah.

50
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,640
Where is it?

51
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,660
I'm waiting.

52
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,060
You think I'll show the goods without pay?

53
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,420
I need to pay dad's bedfills.

54
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:32,520
Anyway, anyway, but yeah, so other stuff also was like, made me sad.

55
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:39,300
But this was like the new, the recent thing, the recent thing that was like bumming, like I say, bumming me out.

56
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,600
But no, I was, I was raised.

57
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,120
I did have like a good cry before because I was like super frustrated.

58
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,420
Because, you know, I thought I was just getting his, I thought I was just, you know, getting his medication.

59
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,260
And then I had to jump through so many hoops.

60
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,760
And then I had to take him to emergency.

61
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,360
And I'm just like, oh my God.

62
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,540
Like, I just wanted a refill.

63
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,780
I had, like, the other times I called the hospital for an emergency refill.

64
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,600
They were like, sure, we'll get it sorted for you right away.

65
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,480
It's because I called out a decent time.

66
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,900
The other times I've done an emergency refill, it was midnight.

67
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,260
I should always call after midnight.

68
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,320
I had competent people at the receptionist.

69
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Yeah

70
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:39,040
It's because I had competent people that were trying to make we got to follow the regulations So that because she hasn't had her checkup

71
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:55,460
She hasn't had a checkup we got to have her I think that's why I'm like you know what at midnight I'm gonna go back and ask if I could go get a refill on some medication and see if they give it to me.

72
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,380
Yeah, they give it a thousand bitties.

73
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,740
Thank you.

74
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,240
Thank you.

75
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:15,200
So maybe I could just pay for the medication and I don't have to, uh, I don't have to, I don't have to like fucking, um, um, pay for the emergency checkup.

76
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,520
Yeah.

77
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,700
I got, maybe the less competent receptionist will be.

78
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,600
I mean, like, that's really bad.

79
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:50,460
though like not like it's really bad that the incompetent uh uh receptionists are are there after midnight because of you know you would want your pets to be taken care of by like competent people and not like you know willy-nilly just handing out medication everywhere but we don't care about that now now i don't care about that i i i want my medication like

80
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,620
We don't care about that.

81
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,080
Yeah, I think it was a...

82
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,160
Oh, wait, I already read that.

83
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,280
But, but, do I cry and study?

84
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,960
You can cry, study, and watch the stream as well.

85
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,760
Hey, Tempo.

86
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,960
Are you excited for Saturday?

87
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,240
Come on.

88
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,160
Are you excited for the Nokia Hot and Seek tournament?

89
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,740
No, he's the organizer.

90
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,660
the thing yeah

91
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:52,680
that's that's um also like i know tomorrow is the guys i do know tomorrow is the street fighter tournament and i'm here playing marvel rivals i think i have two daredevil players i don't have an excuse i i don't have an excuse guys but i know

92
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:06,520
Okay, I'm actually really worried I'm going to lose to the iron and the rookie player as well because like I don't know I feel like I'm just such a fucking wild card.

93
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,520
I don't know.

94
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:22,080
I might do like really well in like it like Like I don't know it really depends on how Um on how like like um If my gamble is a success or not Yeah

95
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,120
Just remember what I learn.

96
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,100
I just need deep stress and Street Fighter makes me stressed out.

97
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,160
It really does.

98
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,340
I just want to chill.

99
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,920
Well, the thing is the other two players have not been playing at all.

100
00:22:50,220 --> 00:23:00,300
Like, I, I, I was like, watch, you know, I, you know, I wanted, I studied their bots and like, one of them, like, such two are like Rookie and Iron or Rookie and Iron.

101
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,420
They haven't been playing.

102
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:30,260
that much i've been scouting it and then but sarah the one who plays aki she's not technically not a new player but like since it was like she had to fill in last like last two day notice um i guess like they were just like well she's like we don't want to give like an actual newbie newbie um like an actual newbie newbie a super hard time so i think i i don't think i'm gonna win against because she actually plays the game.

103
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,680
Like, I picked it back up, like, you know, this week.

104
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,400
Like, I don't know, guys.

105
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,860
Like, I legitimately don't think I can, like, I...

106
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:47,740
Like, if I do get, like, a round offer, it'd be, like, a fucking surprise to everyone.

107
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,260
Like, yeah, like, she's not new at the game, like, the others.

108
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,680
Like, the others are actually, like, picking up for the first time.

109
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:17,720
And like Aki is like a counter to me too like counter to Honda because like Honda can't fucking do shit with range Okay, we're so fucked I don't think our team's gonna win this Well, not the street fighter the rivals I don't know about my team.

110
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:53,840
I haven't been scouting like my own teammates You know like bro my own teammates just scout for themselves like I've been scouting for my like the the Ryu and the jury I'm like I think I if I like if I cheese it I can win it I can win it easily because my cheese is so fucking tilting to play against but I literally don't know if if I can beat the Aki like oh my god I can't see I also can't see Woo!

111
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,840
All right, that's fine on my lap.

112
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,820
I played, okay, guys, I played Street Fighter 4 like a year ago.

113
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,760
And then I never, and then I didn't touch the game after.

114
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,700
Literally after stage of slam, I understalled the game.

115
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,240
Because I was like, I need my hard drive space, you know?

116
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,680
I was like, I need my hard drive.

129
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,700
Just say it.

130
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,380
There's nothing I can't fix.

131
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,540
Bro, it's not drinking my fault.

132
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,500
Bro, they're doing extra time.

133
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,680
30 seconds before you attack.

134
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,640
We have to do Animal Crossing.

135
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,240
Yeah.

136
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,400
Why did we ban cloak?

137
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:37,360
Bro, if I played Luna or Invis, I get absolute fucked by the back, the backline.

138
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,480
There's like nothing I can do.

139
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,790
No, that's, it's like DPS players.

140
00:27:54,370 --> 00:28:15,230
it's just your usual dps player rage like bro if i if i was not on rocket i'd be i'd be so like i'm still dead but like bro they're literally on they're on magic venom and daredevil why the fuck would i swap off rocket like

141
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,830

142
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,550
Like...

143
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,750
Oh my god, yeah, I'm fucking...

144
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,850
Like, this is the most I can get...

145
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,150
Oh.

146
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,850
I thought you guys were fucking bots.

147
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,250
Jesus Christ, worse than bots.

148
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,550
Okay.

149
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,870
I don't think we are the problem, buddy.

150
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,510
I...

151
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,950
Bro, there's no way I'm playing loot.

152
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,950
Oh my god, this guy, all he does.

153
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,210
Oh yeah, funny for the...

154
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,390
Okay, I'll tell you guys a story.

155
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,730
Okay, um...

156
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,210
Um...

157
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,290
I mean, sure.

158
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,890
Like, I think we have to at this point use this.

159
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,750
I...

160
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,570
Okay, funny story.

161
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,790
Um, but I was playing off stream.

162
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,990
And I had two, like, semi-pro players.

163
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:48,650
I say semi because like They're like I don't think they're in like Tier 1 they were in Tier 2 And they thought they Like they were semi throwing my Like not my game Our game Because they're like I mean not I don't know I don't want to say Avoid this whole BOD ass team I won't be like including legend Okay

164
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,410
That's crazy.

165
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:02,690
I feel like, I feel like, um, I feel like he's also part of the bad.

166
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:11,470
Like, no, no, he's right to initiate it because our team was actually terrible.

167
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,710
I feel like we should, but I gotta, I gotta see it.

168
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,490
Is he, that's weird.

169
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:25,070
Why would you ever link your Discord when you're that much, when you're that toxic?

170
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:31,410
I would say if you have that attitude, I don't want anyone knowing my Discord.

171
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:39,390
Even though it's obvious what my Discord is, but I don't want anyone, like, I don't want to link my Discord if I'm that much of a toxic person.

172
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,730
Yeah, keep that to yourself.

173
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,610
Yeah, at that point.

174
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,470
Keep that shit to yourself, buddy.

175
00:30:51,550 --> 00:31:44,590
but okay funny story um okay i thought it was really funny so basically i'll queue up um yeah uh basically uh what happened was that i got in game with two really good players uh but they were on their alt accounts they were on their alt accounts and um they were just like bucking around not like not trying because they're you know they're on their own accounts they try that hard they just want to play other characters and stuff and they're not on their mains and then i was on stream mode but the moment my name was not streamer mode they were like also they were talking a lot in bc just around and stuff because we're like oh we need another support and they're i'm not gonna go support i'm gonna go ultra and like just like you know ultra luna or whatever and It was like,

176
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,890
obviously, like, that's not a great heal cop.

177
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,610
And, um, and so, like, and then the other guy, I don't remember the other guy was like, I'm not going to play tank.

178
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,090
I'm, this is my DPS account.

179
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,290
And they were just fucking around VC, you know, having fun.

180
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:02,050
And then the moment my name got off stream remote, they were like, oh, fuck, it's Doki Bird.

181
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,730
And then we're like, get into school.

182
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,830
God, I need to, he was like, telling this right, bro, get on squad VC.

183
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,110
No, don't use team VC.

184
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,190
Get on squad VC.

185
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,830
And I'll, I'm

186
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,140

188
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:56,170
I was just like, oh my god, like we're sorry, we're so sorry.

189
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,090
That's crazy.

190
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,630
I know, I was just like, what?

191
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,510
Because they were so scared, because they thought, they thought they were on stream.

192
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,170
And I was like, bro, chill, I'm not streaming, man.

193
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,310
I'm not streaming, it's okay.

194
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,240
I thought it was so fucking funny.

195
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:29,220
Uh, but yeah, but I thought, yeah, I thought it was so fucking funny.

196
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,320

Okay, there you go.

222
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,840
Oh my god, I have to...

223
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,280

2,000 heals is a lot.

234
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,080
Jesus Christ.

This is like a terrible comp, but it's fine.

00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,500
This is not the best of comps.

247
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,740

They did it.

264
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,970
They backed up.

265
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,270
Alright.

266
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:29,910

299
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,690
That's unlucky.

300
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,130
I shot it!

301
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:26,910
You don't have it.

302
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,990

303
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,310

00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,650
Oh my god, please.

305
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:40,730
Oh my god, there you go.

306
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,830
There is a widow right here, but who cares, right?

307
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,430
Who cares about that?

308
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,390
There we go.

309
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,930
I am ready to put on a show!

310
00:43:54,930 --> 00:44:01,330
Oh my gosh, the sky that Luna we all hit her like

311
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:09,970
Guys can we all like shoot her is that too hard

312
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:28,450
But that boo you know Including which side you're on no after playing rocket Truly 80% of the season I realized why work so hard

313
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:41,870
Why why work so hard for the same amount of Elo True

314
00:44:46,530 --> 00:45:57,170
Now I understand It's crazy the game got more fun when I stopped caring about about like winning technically can i win cp or no no are you not i still want to win but like it's like if i don't win i'm full of that if i don't win i'm just like oh well no what if i said pretty please i'm just here to have fun I Bro like people When I I bumped into Delaina Like this morning Cause I was playing rank off stream Um Um And I was like Rewatching the stream And he was like Wait is Doki even streaming And like He was in a group call Uh Delaina from 100th ease And they're like No She's just playing for the love of the game Like I don't know It's apparently It's such a wild concept For people to play off stream Like Like,

315
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,730
she's just playing for the love of the game, man.

316
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,070
I do play a lot off-stream.

317
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,390
Just like, you know, I like the...

318
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,010
I like rank.

319
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,590
I like to play off-stream a lot.

320
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,930
Because, you know...

321
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,710
Sometimes I just don't want to...

322
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,590
I just don't want to talk to anyone and just go and just play ring.

323
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,310
That's really it.

324
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,750
There's like no deeper meaning.

325
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,270
I just like playing the game.

326
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,570
I enjoy off-stream and on-stream.

327
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:53,430
tried to play off stream like when i'm feeling particularly inspired but i want to all right that's fine i don't know oh my god the reload it's fine we're fine we're fine everything is fine also i can't look at chat as much when i'm on luna i just didn't know i always i'm reading chat 70 of time when i'm on rocket

328
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,090
Yeah, but it won't be as fun.

329
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:06,310
I'm going to use that.

330
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:09,670
Don't worry, you're fine.

331
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:10,370
You're so healthy.

332
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:11,890
You're so healthy.

333
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:16,770
Jesus.

334
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,430
Oh my gosh, she's in here.

335
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,230
Me?

336
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:23,310
Me?

337
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,310
What?

338
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,790
Oh my god, okay.

339
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,090
Why is the anvil up?

340
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,170
Why the fuck was he throwing?

341
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:38,310
Did he not see the fucking mantis?

342
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:43,150
I was just surprised it was me, you know?

343
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,860
Like, he could have fucked, oh my...

344
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,920
Me again!

345
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,680
Okay.

346
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,540
Me again.

347
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,470
The fucking tunnel vision.

348
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,850
I was just not expecting it again.

349
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,080
You know?

350
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,380
We're going.

351
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,700
I might

352
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,200
be dead from that.

353
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,160
Oh, I'm dead from this!

354
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,320
Okay.

355
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,740
Fuck me, I guess.

356
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,080
I'm getting hurt.

357
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,240
Three times in a row.

358
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,600
You would have got res, but the map broke my res.

359
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,780
That's not bad.

360
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,540
Me again.

361
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,320
Oh, my God.

362
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,840
Oh, my God.

363
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,580
Okay, okay.

364
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,700
Love battlefield medicine.

365
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,200
This is why I hate playing Luna now.

366
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,180
That was fine.

367
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:13,920
But thank you.

368
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Bro, this is boring.

369
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,200
You're running triple now.

370
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,320
So there...

371
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,680
So...

372
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,080
Oh my god.

373
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,280
Luna.

374
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,380
Bro, I had to reload.

375
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,100
Okay, if he was yelling at me, I would have been like, I was reloading.

376
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,900
I would have actually used my mic and be like, I was reloading.

377
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,800
I'm on a lead and I'm on a lead.

378
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:37,560
Wow!

379
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:42,500
It's like this is a shitty heel cop or some shit.

380
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,060
I got spiked.

381
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,820
I can't do anything when I'm like four people looking at me.

382
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,300
Go out right, go out right, go out right, go out right, go out right.

383
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,820
Someone needs a snowball in the face.

384
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,360
Yeah, we can't touch this.

385
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,800
It's like maybe we need triple support.

386
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,980
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

387
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:07,820
I don't know.

388
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,840
We might need triple support, guys.

389
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,240
Just a little maybe.

390
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,300
Wouldn't it be wild if we had triple support, guys?

391
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,220
Or maybe not, Mantisius?

392
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,660
We are not getting enough, like, Mantis up for this.

393
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,680
To make this worth it.

394
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,060
I will say it now.

395
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,480
We are undefeatable!

396
00:50:36,120 --> 00:51:02,420
we are definitely oh my god we still have it oh my god we still there you go oh okay look we i got trapped okay look we i got trapped i got trapped Oh, we're gonna summon one right now.

397
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,780
Oh, did we kill him?

398
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,460
Look, I did not have conf- oh.

399
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,940
We must retreat for safety.

400
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:14,500
Look.

401
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,500
There is a fucking squirrel girl behind us!

402
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,760
Oh my god.

403
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,520
There was a squirrel girl behind us that we didn't look at.

404
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:25,800
Come back up.

405
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,500
I'm gonna keep trying too much.

406
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,000
I did not realize there was a squirrel girl behind us.

407
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,400
I would not have played like that.

408
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,300
I wanted to save people's lives.

409
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,180
We're trapped.

410
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:22,520
Bro, I can't It's like maybe Mantis duo here with Luna was not the I was not the key was not the key The current score is three two three see this is why This is why we need triple support

411
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:42,740
Because I'm not playing Luna anyway It was not fun I'll play Invis If you can play Something else We need long range Just play cop and just run at the widow

412
00:52:45,840 --> 00:53:02,760
I feel like I feel like Not a Luna game Oh my god Now we have a cap Okay we have to play Luna I play Luna and give Captain America The thing Oh that reep Oh, it's Twitch.

413
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,340
I was like, you have replay.

414
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,300
I was like, oh, you got me.

You got me.

417
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,460

I was like, what?

419
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,140

Yeah, but it didn't last long.

426
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,620

Just show us that man who carried it.

429
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:38,840
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

430
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,460
If you turn it off, you turn off VODs.

00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,480
Holy shit, bro.

Oh god.

458
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:12,580
Hello.

459
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:16,510
Okay.

460
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:17,670
We're fine.

461
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,090
Here we go.

462
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:22,810
We're fine for now.

463
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:23,870
Yeah!

464
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:26,030
Oh, thank you.

465
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,050
God.

466
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,390
You know, the play attack.

467
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:34,670
Take defense.

468
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,170
Thank God.

469
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,050
They surrendered.

470
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:44,370
That means they were, the other team was yelling at each other so much that they, yeah, they mental boomed.

471
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,590
Thank God.

472
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:47,930
Bro, oh my God.

473
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,810
I was, I was 20s.

474
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,350
Bro, I mean, he was mad at us.

475
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:56,910
He was mad at us, but I felt like, oh my God.

476
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:29,630
it was a lot like I'm just happy we don't have to we don't have to play a defense against that holy shit we meant to boom them thank fucking god yeah I think I'm pretty sure they were flaming each other I'm pretty sure um yeah Daredevil is um these are the bands that are Everyone does for Rivals.

477
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:36,090
It is Daredevil, Hela, Emma, Scylark,

478
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,530
You can see why we don't have enough fans.

479
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:42,330
Hey, Gully.

480
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,030
What else?

481
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,890
Other than that, I think that's it.

482
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:50,410
Like, these are the six.

483
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,250
I bet you got Mantis.

484
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,830
Do you have everyone uploads?

485
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:55,410
is that everything daredevil jeff emma silok bucky hella oh venom seven bands these are the seven bands that everyone does for this season uh so yeah uh that's what we have uh so we don't have enough bands for all seven of these it's because like they didn't really do much to to nerf Bucky but because they nerfed everything else it made Bucky so strong and then you gotta make sure also like for bands you gotta like you know do 5d chess just making sure like maybe the other team won't ban that character and so you're not gonna get all seven like you know we only have four bands and maybe maybe in the end we get two bands because we all ban the same thing because you don't know what the other team is gonna be banning

486
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:33,500
isn't as a Jeff main Jeff gets his ult too fast it's not even his alt it's literally his his heel the fact that his heel does piercing um like because like you know if you don't have a jeff and the enemy team has a jeff it's so oppressive that's the main reason why jeff is like really difficult right now and why people ban him because like getting a good jeff alt is also really difficult in this elo just because like you know everyone tends to save their cooldowns and stuff against the jeff eat so It's,

487
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,200
like, really hard to make it work.

488
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,360
It's really not hard to make, but it's really hard to be good at Jeff in this Elo.

489
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,740
Because if you're going against, like, you know, like, you know, you have to be careful of the mag.

490
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:54,060
The bubbles, the mag bubbles, the mag up, the DPS we were ulting as well.

491
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:54,880
Hello, everyone.

492
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:55,760
Oh, my God.

493
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,660
We made a cage.

494
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:56,940
Okay.

495
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,940
Dance for us in this.

496
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,020
Oh, my God.

497
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:00,480
Dance.

498
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,400
Come on.

499
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,020
Come on.

500
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,280
But, do you...

501
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:11,240
Do you have the dance emote?

502
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,500
Oh, no!

503
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,500
I provided the ball.

504
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,240
The mag came over to save me.

505
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,360
The mag was like, begun.

506
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:36,430
Alright, I played a Luna game, so this is my rocket game.

507
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:45,670

508
01:00:50,840 --> 01:01:04,820
all right the mag was just was just trying to protect the mantis he's like she was just a small time girl

509
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,260
He's like, we gotta save her.

510
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:21,270
Oh, hey, we have just Mia support.

511
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:22,330
That's cool.

512
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:25,010
I'm cool with that.

513
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:31,130
Yeah, I'm cool with that, guys.

514
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,710
Yeah, they're saving her from us Hollywood types.

515
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,440
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

516
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,640
Alright, hey guys.

517
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,300
Don't worry.

518
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,040
Technically, we have two supports, me and the group.

519
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,920
Oh, yeah, I like how this guy just thought about if I should...

520
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,900
It's like, you know what?

521
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,360
Starlord.

522
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,500
Ha ha ha.

523
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,330
Escape pod ready.

524
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,650
30 seconds before you attack.

525
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:27,450
Get ready.

526
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,130
Alright, here we go.

527
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,970
Orenkis the Celestio, too.

528
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:34,570
It's alright.

529
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,150
It's decent rank in this Evo.

530
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:37,590
Yeah.

531
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:41,710
Obviously, Eternity is the top 500 right now, right?

532
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,870
Low Eternity is top 500.

533
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,440
It's crazy.

534
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:03,280
Like, so little, like, this season, like, last season, everyone was fucking climbing so hard last season.

535
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,160
This season, it's, like, barely...

536
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,420
I think you should go top right.

537
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,060
Don't tell that.

538
01:03:07,060 --> 01:04:28,460
barely every anyone climbed this season it's because it's not dragon it's not the dragon icon everyone was like wanted the dragon icon no one wants the peach which is understandable it's understandable why no one wanted that what happened to our in this where's our where's our team why did we go this way I'm so confused no everyone was climbing so hard for the dragon badge but no one's climbing as much for the peach one I think it's also cuz like ignite dude everyone was like not playing ring because you know everyone has to practice for the one million dollar tournament anyway so like that's made sense everyone wanted that wouldn't no one was touching ring oh don't worry i'm chucking my heels i should play again what didn't we say we're gonna go top right why are we still going top right

541
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,060
Unless right side is...

542
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,240
Oh my god, wait, right side is the...

543
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,320
Oh my god, wait, I guess I'll...

544
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,280
You know what, I'll eat my words.

545
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:49,720
You know what?

546
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,180
As an adult, I know when I'm wrong.

547
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:54,520
Maybe he was right.

548
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:02,460
You know, being an adult means that you know when you are wrong.

549
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,080
Right was right.

550
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:29,360
And I will have to admit that he might have been right that right side was the right way to go See I can grow as a person and know when I'm wrong guys I can grow as a person I know when I'm wrong.

551
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:35,300
I know I can admit when I'm wrong Wait, what the fuck?

552
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:41,490
What the?

553
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:44,150
Oh my god.

554
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:46,430
Alright.

555
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:49,190
Nice.

556
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:51,730
We're all alive.

557
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,230
We should be fine.

558
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,210
We should be fine theoretically.

559
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,570
I go back one, team.

560
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:00,790
Oh my god.

01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:01,890
Please.

562
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:06,250
Strange is still on...

563
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,270
Oh, Strange is not on the card anymore.

564
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:09,850
No gold.

565
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,550

566
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,130

He's so good.

569
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:44,350
Hey guys, I think they're TPing.

570
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:48,810
No, I don't think so as a portal fucking opens up.

571
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:51,130
It's like a different game.

572
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:55,250
Guys, I don't think...

573
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,550
Oh my god.

574
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,630
Bro, oh my god.

575
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,370
Okay, I thought he was still behind us.

576
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:02,370
What the fuck?

577
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:04,110
Change one, change one, change one.

578
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:06,270
Is he still one?

579
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:09,050
Is he like one inside in the room with us right now?

580
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:10,970
They won't win.

581
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:11,370
They won't win.

582
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:12,270

01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,010
I have no idea what you're talking about.

597
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:43,010

598
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:46,010
Dude, there's so many Johnny G's apparently.

599
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,930
Apparently Johnny G's everywhere.

600
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,060
Oh my god, okay.

601
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:00,600
Nice.

602
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,820
Where's our M12?

603
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,320
They're in here.

604
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,320
I have to put it in there.

605
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,920
Bro, hey guys, he's strange all day.

608
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:22,570
Oh.

609
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:26,830
I like how we went outside of our Invisalte there.

610
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,890
Look, I didn't want my amp to get destroyed, guys.

611
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:34,570
Well, that's where she dies.

612
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,270
We too.

613
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:36,010
We grew up.

614
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:36,950
I don't want to commit anything.

615
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:39,130
Hello.

616
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:42,950
Is everybody...

617
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:43,630
Oh, oh, oh.

618
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:44,970
Oh.

619
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:45,750
Oh.

620
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:47,110
Oh.

621
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,630
Guess I'll go this way.

622
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:51,070
Alright, it's time.

623
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:51,590
Are they not?

624
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:52,690
They're not going dive.

625
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:55,150
Alright, time to play a different game now.

626
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:00,750
Time to play hard mode.

627
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:05,010
Alright, no more casual.

628
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:05,970
La-di-da.

629
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,470
Time to actually play the game.

630
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,650
Yeah, time to sit up straight.

631
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:13,750
No more slouching.

632
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:21,370
Unfortunately, it's gamer hours now.

633
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,900
Oh, I just hope he, oh, oh.

634
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,960
What the fuck?

635
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:36,260
Oh,

636
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:43,310
my god, okay.

637
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:45,290
All right.

638
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:47,510
Thank god I got the ice freeze.

639
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:50,790
I will say, if I didn't get the ice freeze, we could have lost that.

640
01:10:50,810 --> 01:11:08,350
100% or like I wouldn't have been able to live like I needed that ice freeze to like be alive are you serious no you better fucking live

641
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:51,510
all right back on rocket duty if I make it technically I should be tp-ing but yay technically never punished yay i didn't get punished i don't know how to tp i'm worried i'm gonna get up with the trigger yell at me i i rather than yell at me we're not TPing.

642
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:54,150
Then they yell at me for fucking up the TP.

643
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,930
It's the little things, chat.

644
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,750
It's the tiny things.

645
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:18,920
Yeah, the thing is, if I fuck up the TP, like, everyone will see how bad the TP is.

646
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:30,300
Like, if I, like, accidentally, like, put it in the wrong place or, like, like, And I could be like, oh, I thought someone else would TP.

647
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,540
I could literally say that.

648
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,420
But then everyone will see me fuck up my TP.

649
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,260
And I don't want to deal with that.

650
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,240
I'd rather everyone see me, not know, forgot to pick Strange.

651
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,880
Coincidentally, I forgot to pick him.

652
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:56,930
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

653
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:57,950
All right.

654
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:03,070
I'll go, I'll rock it first because I don't know if they'll go dive.

655
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:03,690
That's the thing.

656
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:11,750
Oh my god, I swear to God, if our Invis was like to the right just a little bit, he could have got headshot.

657
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,870
You're actually gonna get a headshot there.

658
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:16,150
That's crazy.

659
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,370
He was that close.

660
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:18,030
All right.

661
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:21,770
They're not going dive, so I can't believe they're going to have to.

662
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:26,990
That's good to know, you know.

663
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,070
Oh, never mind.

664
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,970
I can do... I can play against Captain on Luna.

665
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,720
Oh, goodbye.

666
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,840
Yeah, this is the stress stream.

667
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,020
I'm not here to get more stressed out, guys.

668
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,040
It's fine.

669
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:54,290
Yay!

670
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,070
Easiest game of my life.

671
01:13:57,610 --> 01:13:59,450
I stay until I lose the game.

672
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,810
There is a... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

673
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:03,770
You know, that could have been me.

674
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:09,050
See that Envis woman that's getting like absolutely fucked fucked up on by captain?

675
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:13,510
That could have been me, but instead I'm out here.

676
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:17,330
Oh my god, I knew I heard something.

677
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:25,410
There is a Captain America behind us, but we're not gonna think about that, I guess.

678
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,250
All right.

679
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:38,790
That's fine.

680
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:40,770
That's fine.

681
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:41,670
Don't make me all.

682
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:45,830
If I get yelled at for ulting there to save my own life, don't make me do it.

683
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:50,270
Don't make me do it.

684
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:54,210
If I am about to die, I will throw this all down.

685
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,430
Okay, I'll let our...

686
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:01,870
Okay, our Invis is trying to find the cap.

687
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:03,930
You should be building your alt right now, sir.

688
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:04,810
Right.

689
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:12,110
Yeah, yeah, Raccoon is an auto- No, Raccoon is an auto-clicker.

690
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,250
Luna is Toho.

691
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:16,690
I agree.

692
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:18,590
Luna is Toho.

693
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:21,730
Yo, do not am.

694
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:22,070
Don't am.

695
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:24,110
Just kite, kite, trust, trust, trust, trust.

696
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:24,490
Okay.

697
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:26,730
If I get back and we have Invisal first, Invisal first.

698
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:27,650
Okay.

699
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:31,330
Okay.

700
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:32,690
Okay.

701
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:36,390
Hey guys.

702
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:37,290
Hey!

703
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,730
So what was the plan?

704
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:49,390
Guys, what was the plan that we had?

705
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:53,510
I thought we, I felt like we had a great plan that we drafted out.

706
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:55,830
Yeah, yeah, I will say.

707
01:15:56,430 --> 01:16:01,530
I thought that we were, you know, I thought we had a plan, guys.

708
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,150
What?

709
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:07,950
I like how none of the plan, none of what we were.

710
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:10,390
we had on the plan worked out in the end.

711
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:14,830
We didn't get anything going in there.

712
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:18,210
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

713
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,610
What happened to our...

714
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:20,090
What's wrong?

715
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:20,570
We're solved.

716
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:21,650
Alt, alt, alt, alt, alt, alt.

717
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:23,050
Okay, okay, okay.

718
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:23,930
Okay, we don't need it.

719
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:24,410
We don't need it.

720
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:25,190
We don't need it.

721
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:25,730
We don't need it.

722
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:26,350
We don't need it.

723
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:28,250
I am very surprised we lived.

724
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,970
There was a big chance that we were not going to live there.

725
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:36,370
I'm very surprised.

726
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:37,930
We should not have lived there.

727
01:16:37,970 --> 01:17:00,730
simple geometry I have a plan that step one has failed step one invisible invisible first somehow we somehow failed step one it's actually crazy there was five steps in this plan but yeah we failed the first step

728
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:08,800
all right

729
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:23,580
no this is for me this is de-stressful because it's like it's i'm using video games to escape from reality this is escapism

730
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:42,000
oh where it's like 10 it's not that late you should play it play this like later it has one shirt exactly Hey, so are we okay?

731
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:42,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

732
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:43,820
There we go.

733
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:45,640
There we go.

734
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,020
We did plan one this time.

735
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,360
We did step one.

736
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:49,960
Thank God.

737
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:52,700
I'm glad.

738
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,460
I'm glad we didn't fail step one.

739
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:57,720
Thank God.

740
01:17:58,860 --> 01:17:59,560
Because we did it.

741
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,620
We did step one.

742
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,560
See, if I was Luna, if I was Luna, I'd be dead by now.

743
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,180
I went and climbed the way.

744
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:15,300
Alright.

745
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:17,380
It's not too late.

746
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,560
Only if I keep playing.

747
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:20,200
E-he.

748
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:26,060
Only if I keep playing.

749
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:26,840
Got two.

750
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:28,960
Okay, I think.

751
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:30,960
They're just gonna.

752
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,880
They're gonna shoot it.

753
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,520
But like.

754
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,260
You know, we have our little bit of HP though.

755
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:36,960
And there's one.

756
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,300
There's one.

757
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,860
Oh Nope, that's fine.

758
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:49,340
That's fine Where did my thing go?

759
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:50,700
Oh, that's fine.

760
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,560
Watch this.

762
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,180

I died I That's fine.

766
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,860
All right, our Invis is okay.

767
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,800
Our Invis is okay.

768
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,880
I don't know about our Bucky, but...

769
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:21,360
Don't worry, Johnny G!

770
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,100
I got my Rez!

771
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,100
Oh, no.

772
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,540
Oh, no, we died with...

773
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:28,580
We died with up.

774
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,400
Oh, no, not anymore!

775
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,820
I used the Rez.

776
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:35,860
Oh, that is bad.

777
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:37,940
Okay, that is okay.

778
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,180
Okay, that is not good.

779
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,540
That is not good.

780
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:49,340
I didn't think they will all shoot it.

781
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:51,160
Wait, unless?

782
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:52,280
Oh, unless!

783
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:53,800
Wait, wait, they're winning!

784
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:55,840
I always believe.

785
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,040
Yay!

786
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,580
We did it.

787
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,700
We did it, guys.

788
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:05,420
He's not.

789
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:07,860
No, alright.

790
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,580
That's how it is.

791
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,380
See, isn't it good that I didn't portal?

792
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,520
And Samra, thank you for the 150s, thank you, thank you.

793
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,460
Keeper, thank you for the Twitch Prime, thank you, thank you.

794
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,740
Who's Tato?

795
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,280
Potato?

796
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,820
GG, my bad.

797
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,640
This guy?

798
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,000
Who's this guy?

799
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,280
What the fuck is Tato?

800
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:32,900
Who's this guy?

801
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,820
All part of the plan, see?

802
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,140
All part of the plan.

803
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,100
I don't need a portal.

804
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:46,240
i'm just a dumb old support player i don't know what i'm doing i just hold that right click

805
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,620
t he

806
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:45,660
oh yeah don't worry guys i'll practice street fighter don't worry i'll make sure i'll be ready tomorrow i am a little scared i'm trying not to feel the thing is i also don't want to like practice too much because i practice too much i get in my own head too like i get i get two in my head so i'm trying to be more more like casual about it too because i don't want to like uh too too much practice that i get so stressed out about it so i'm taking a more relaxed approach because i am i am practicing i'm trying you know i i like you know range uh sessions and everything i coaches and stuff i did play rank off stream but i don't want to get two in my head as well i'll I'll make a custom lobby later,

807
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,900
too, to practice against the characters.

808
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,040
Okay, these people are actually fighting.

809
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,500
I'm trying to, like, fucking try and find roleplayers.

810
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,360
But these guys are, like, these guys are harassing me.

811
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:56,840
That's it.

812
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,340
Where are my roleplay servers?

813
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,760
Do you end up learning another character?

814
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,260
No, I'm just gonna be the Honda.

815
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:08,600
I think the thing is, all three...

816
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,440
I have to play a character that acts...

817
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,340
Like, the thing is, Zeng Yi?

818
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,620
It gets hard countered by all three of those characters.

819
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:18,940
That's the thing.

820
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,520
Like, there's no...

821
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:27,080
Because, like, if I have to learn their character, like, obviously the easiest would be Zengief for me because I already play it.

822
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:32,160
But, like, Juri, Aki, and Ryu, all hard counters Zengief.

823
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,600
Like, because he has...

824
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,220
They all have spam.

825
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,020
And I struggle the most against spam characters.

826
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:52,790
yeah he's tough um just grabs him bro

827
01:22:57,190 --> 01:23:01,650
i do well against character like i do well against characters that don't have fireball

828
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:24,460
oh i mean i could play in this you know i'll play in this i'll do in this i have no guys i have one day there's no way I'm learning a fucking character like a different character in one day that hard counters those three

829
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:58,860
yeah but uh I mean I just think I my goal was to win one game that's like when uh one game if I win one game I'm happy that's that's that's it I'm going in with low expectations And, well, the thing is, I can't say not last because it depends on my team as well.

830
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:04,980
And I don't know how my team's going to, I don't know how my team's going to do in general overall.

831
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:17,220
Because the only, the issue is that, um, the issue, the biggest issue that I noticed was that half the roster for the Capcom tournament is in Seijam Slam.

832
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:26,140
And I've noticed that majority of players that are in the Seijam Slam 2XKO tournament, have been practicing QXHL versus Street Fighter.

833
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:30,020
So I don't know how they are going to be like in Street Fighter.

834
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,700
Like, you know, I have, like, you know, the previous St. John Slams and the previous streams they've done.

835
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,420
But, like, I don't know how they're going to be like for...

836
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:41,900
Not just...

837
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:42,640
No, my team.

838
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,320
I have one player on my team that's in the QXHL.

839
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:52,260
But apparently, QXHL is so fucking complicated and, like, really tilting to practice on for those who are like...

840
01:24:52,260 --> 01:25:50,520
it's like it's a tag team so yeah it has different inputs and it's a tag team i was watching a little bit and apparently everyone's like so fucking mad at t-mo or some shit because he's like extremely spammy and everything everyone was like god damn it if i wasn't playing a t-mo oh everyone was i just everyone was just complaining about t-mo i don't understand why because i don't understand t-scale but it's like a whole different breed of like fighting games in terms of difficulty and also like what i noticed is that in 2xpo when they get that one combo off they just die i was like watching because i was watching a little bit because i was like curious and literally this guy was like one hp and the enemy team was full hp he hit he he like got one string of combo and it was over like the other team lost i was so surprised i was so fucking surprised I was like,

841
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,400
what do you mean the other team?

842
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,860
Yeah, it's apparently very easy too

843
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:04,400
Like it was like he literally Yeah, there was like one-shot combos or something

844
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:14,450
So that's like really scary IMO that the game is like that

845
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:20,290
Stay up here hulking and just stay back there

846
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:33,950
It seems very tilting when especially the tag team aspect because apparently in the tag team aspect It's like even more like tilting with the and the chip damage too

847
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,320
Are you seeing I'm using leverless

848
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,960
Oh no three oh god thank god okay thank god

849
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:07,690
All right There you go push them away Hello.

850
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,640
There we go.

851
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,660
There we go.

852
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:15,500
That's crazy.

853
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:17,060
I was outside of that.

854
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,600
Yeah, that was bullshit.

855
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,280
I saw myself outside the ring and I still got hit.

856
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,640
I was like, are you serious?

857
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,400
I was not expecting that.

858
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,900
I swear to God, it looked like I was outside too.

859
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,920
That's what, that was like, what the fuck?

860
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:44,200
I was like, Hey guys, um, there is a big man that wants to fucking beat me up right now.

861
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:49,160
Yeah, I don't like Jeff's a lot.

862
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,480
Alright, I'll push the cart.

863
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,200
Well, never mind, I go...

864
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,480
Don't kill him.

865
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,160
We can charge our ult.

866
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,160
Oh wait, we already have ult.

867
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:03,140
Yeah, I was gonna say we have a lot of ult.

868
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,800
You're halfway there.

869
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:09,680
Keep going!

870
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:11,300
Yeah.

871
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,680
But it seems very tilting.

872
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,180
I saw a lot of people that were like super tilted.

873
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:21,760
Because of the combo shit.

874
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,160
Oh shit.

875
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,700
Okay, I got scared.

876
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,960
Oh my god, I'm getting very scared.

877
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:53,010
Oh my god, I only used that up because I got scared of the Hella.

878
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:58,410
Why was there a double alt line?

879
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:00,130
Oh yeah, why was there?

880
01:29:01,390 --> 01:29:04,390
They do have... Okay, the Hella didn't get the alt off.

881
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:05,230
Okay, the Hella died.

882
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:08,050
Yeah.

883
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,410
So like, I don't know.

884
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:13,870
I don't know how the too much tournament is gonna be like to be fair.

885
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:24,690
only just because like like I said like I said like a lot of people that are in the Capcom tournament they're also

886
01:29:30,250 --> 01:30:16,290
they're also like in the 2x KO so I don't know how people are gonna whoa maybe yay I'm in my own this where did everyone go oh I was like I swear to God there was like a lot of people on that cart like what happened if you try and stall your old double voice sign yeah oh that's what happened to him I was so confused I was like I was like did you oh my god still you're up for three seconds and if you do it all double voice lines

887
01:30:19,370 --> 01:31:25,790
no one man i understand not who those are all right i just don't want to die to the hell out honestly we had to kill him before like before he does um you know the uh there hello okay there you go all right we're fine what the fuck okay we're fine for real all right they still have armed and dangerous and again oh and that too i forgot about that get him out of here i'll push him who is over there in the enemy okay there you all right there you have still have watch it's gonna happen oh never mind johnny g couldn't get it just stand there and take headshot damage all right should be a lot of healing all right there you go yay

888
01:31:29,330 --> 01:32:44,790
no more again no more again time to switch things up including which side you're on kind of um should only be yeah no i'm saying like i don't know how my team is going to do against the other teams because like everyone's been focused on practicing because half the tournament has say jam slams 2x ko tournament as in the 2x ko tournament and all of the majority of them have been practicing have been practicing for the 2x ko tournament because that like a lot of the players haven't played that game before so um they all have been like they all have been like on training for that so I don't know the skill level like I don't know if my team will be better or worse like that's what I'm saying like I know I'm fighting the other beginners but also like the one player the one player um that I'm scared of is the one that is not a beginner because you have to fill in for someone that had to drop out last minute but she's not um but she's like she's been playing for a while point one second your

889
01:32:44,790 --> 01:33:12,350
head is zero yeah they practice 2x heal I practice mob arrivals so I'm that's the the person I'm scared of the most the not baby yeah I'm in the baby category but I have to fight like a teenager it's like yeah it's like it's like a baby fight and then a teenage and then one of them's a teenager

890
01:33:19,390 --> 01:34:28,960
oh what the what who's who's shooting me just take some headshot damage and i should be allowed to like okay like he is baby boost right now like guys i don't think you want him to take headshot damage unless you're saying group i was gonna say like you should not be taking damage we have another tank now thank god yeah that's why i'm like not stressing out too much like i did for sayjam um because i know if i take it too seriously it's gonna affect how i play too like i'm gonna get like so stressed out to get like super stressed out about it so whatever happens happens i'm in wait after this after bravo's i'll practice more history credit

891
01:34:33,140 --> 01:35:20,660

We're gonna have Jeff up soon at least.

895
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,400
You can tell he's a Jeff main too, the way he's playing.

896
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:02,100
Oh my.

897
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,520
Alright.

898
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:05,020
That's fine.

899
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:08,580
Jesus Christ.

900
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,540
Oh my.

901

We got it.

907
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:24,520
Oh my god, everyone was taking so much damage there.

908
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,280
I am so surprised we won that fight in the end.

909
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:29,120
That was so much damage.

910
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:34,300
Oh!

911
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:37,640
Everyone was taking so much damage.

912
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:40,280
Yep, they're TPA.

913
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:43,700
I don't think they know I'm behind.

914
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,880
They don't know I'm right.

915
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:57,950
Oh, God.

916
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,620
Oh, my God, wait.

917
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:05,760
Also, another techie.

918
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:09,400
Oh, Jeff is riding her back and she doesn't jump.

919
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:14,220
Oh, Jeff, his strength hits him no matter what, because of how the hell I'll do this.

920
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,040
I don't say this often.

921
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:19,880
I'm so fast.

922
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:25,960
I don't say this often, but I think Jeff is this hyper fixation.

923
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:26,840
I

924
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:55,460
Awesome Fun fact guys I I have a feeling that Jeff is his Hyper fixation Holy hell of this All of you just hit all our shots on me That's crazy We lost the fight and he's like By the way guys here's another Fun Jeff deck

925
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:05,740
All right.

926
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:10,240
It was a very fun fact.

927
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:14,800
I learned a lot from this one guy.

928
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:22,980
Oh shit, nice.

929
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:25,180

930
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:30,430

01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:06,580
Okay.

Okay.

948
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,020

949
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,180
Okay, I'm alive

950

Look at that recovery recovery.

953
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:53,100
Jesus Christ.

954
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,800
Oh my god, that was a huge shift for me.

955
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,340
Oh, I couldn't get to you, but I have this.

956
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:09,740
Oh, yeah.

957
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,940
Oh, like a shark attack survivor.

958
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,460
Don't win yet.

959
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:23,660
I mean, do you have any more Jeff facts?

960
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:30,680
Let's, you know, we can enable him a little bit more.

961
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:41,600
Shout out to his fun facts, Fun facts are neat.

962
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:46,460
Yeah, I should have thrown so we could hear more facts from him.

963
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,980
Guys, I don't think he has any more.

964
01:40:49,280 --> 01:41:00,140
I think he left already i mean um goodbye or good old fun facts i'm gonna use the bathroom i'll be right back guys

965
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:50,090
did he he didn't give us any more facts oh maybe those were all it that's why he told us more fun facts when we died in our fight it's like i gotta squeeze one more in before they all before they all go.

966
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:52,990
He only does, yeah.

967
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:53,990
He only, yeah.

968
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,870
No, he only does live shows.

969
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:58,170
He wants us to hear the fun facts.

970
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:00,370
It ain't the same when you're reading it, guys.

971
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:01,810
It's not the same.

972
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:03,010
He needs it.

973
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:06,490
It has to be verbal only.

974
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:14,280
I like how the son of Jesus Christ asked me how old I am.

975
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:18,240
Why does Jesus want me to dox myself?

976
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:19,120
Huh?

977
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,700
You can ask me that in heaven.

978
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:24,580
Oh, he's like the son of Jesus.

979
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,660
Yeah, you can ask me that in heaven, bro.

980
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:36,290
Mr. Six, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

981
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:37,290
Thank you, thank you.

982
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,040
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

983
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:45,960
Yeah, dad is barking.

984
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,000
I have no idea why.

985
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:48,880
Let's open the Luna now.

986
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,260
I'll go check on him.

987
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,160
I'll be back again.

988
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:52,220
I gotta check on him.

989
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,240
Who am I going to banish from this match?

990
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,120
This won't be in my room.

991
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,700
I still want to be in my room.

992
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,480
He's like, no!

993
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:19,680
He's like, no!

994
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,960
I think it's just because my room is too hot for him.

995
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,360
I'll be surprised if that's the reason why.

996
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,480
I feel a little too hot.

997
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:34,360
Oh yeah, but if you guys can, please feel free to nominate me as Best Marvel Rival Streamer.

998
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:37,380
I would really appreciate it a lot.

999
01:44:37,480 --> 01:46:02,120
guys it will mean alive i can get nominated um what i'm scared right now is literally the panel vote which is why i've been streaming um because they're like it's not popular vote to be nominated because they're like oh we don't want to make sure like you know we don't want to uh make it just a popular vote so i'm just scared that the panel wouldn't put me in because i don't have you know rival streamers stream it like every day and I like I talk about rivals every day and like for free I look I get free publicity by talking about rivals in other streams so I feel like that makes me more qualified to be the best Marvel rival streamer because I would mention rivals in different games and I feel that that makes me the best Marvel rival streamer like I might not play Marvel rivals a lot I do play a lot I might not stream it a lot but it's always a part of my stream in one way or another yeah yeah

1000
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:20,550
I advertise it to the variety audience which is more important than advertising it to the rivalous audience because like it's like non-rival play it might make non-rival players be aware of Marvel Rivals

1001
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:29,650
so if anything if anything I should be nominated

1002
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:54,870
exactly exactly Yeah, I hope I hope I can I hope I'm in the nominations That's uh, that's why I'm trying That's why I've also been streaming it so the people who um So the people who are at the panel when they pull up my channel and they don't know who I am They'll be like Yeah,

1003
01:46:54,870 --> 01:47:04,910
she does stream in like you know I want to see and be like oh, yeah, no she does stream rivals like she ain't making that up

1004
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:12,840
Oh my god, there is a...

1005
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:18,730
What did I put on my YouTube?

1006
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:20,650
My YouTube also has rivals.

1007
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:22,170
It might not be as much.

1008
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:25,770
But also, like, majority of the people on the panel are...

1009
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:36,440
I will say majority of people on the panel, I will assume that they are Twitch people.

1010
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,980
So they would look at the Twitch first.

1011
01:47:48,360 --> 01:48:06,400
oh my god i don't know if i i have to yeah i don't think i can play like a other other support i'm like thinking if i should play jesus christ i'm even clapping

1012
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:16,320
what the fuck the phoenix doesn't have alt yet phoenix isn't playing like Oh, chicken?

1013
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:17,500
Please, I have to reload.

1014
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:20,940
Oh my god.

1015
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:23,500
Oh, oh, we got it.

1016
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:26,600
Oh, oh, I knew it.

1017
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:28,000
I knew I had to get away.

1018
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,180
Oh, no.

1019
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,160
I got stunned in my class.

1020
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:38,620
That sucks.

1021
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:40,360
Because we didn't know for the stars.

1022
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,580
I don't think we're winning those guys.

1023
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,500
I don't think.

1024
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:48,560
Alright, we're going to Maybe.

1025
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:01,580
Alright, because we're all like standing in a straight line, so maybe this will help.

1026
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:14,000
Okay.

1027
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:15,940
Alright, it's fine, it's fine.

1028
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,380
It's not fine because the Starlord is...

1029
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,080
Yo, are you real?

1030
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:23,260
What the fuck was that?

1031
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:39,740
oh my god the starlord is still behind us we have not killed the starlord yet and i'm scared because of that the

1032
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,830
fact that like that starlord is still there

1033
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:57,900
jesus christ all right maybe we have to i'm not standing in there

1034
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:02,580
You know what they're gonna do next?

1035
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:04,280
Oh, wait, never mind.

1036
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:06,340
But they're still gonna do that next.

1037
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:08,340
They're gonna do the Star Lord next.

1038
01:50:14,690 --> 01:50:16,370
That's what I'm scared about.

1039
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:19,750
Oh, oh, that is.

1040
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:23,150
Get ready for legendary, guys.

1041
01:50:24,230 --> 01:50:26,310
Oh, oh, next fight, next fight, next fight.

1042
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:27,410
It's gonna happen next fight.

1043
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:32,370
I have to either build my alt first or we're gonna get legendary.

1044
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:42,000
Yeah, I knew the moment that Punisher was gonna, oh, like I was, I'm not standing next to him.

1045
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:44,420
Like, it's the only reason.

1046
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:45,180
Get ready.

1047
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:46,380
He's coming.

01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,220
He's gonna do it.

1049
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:49,000
Get ready.

1050
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:52,940
He's trying to flank.

1051
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:53,980
I can feel it.

1052
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:54,680
Why don't I?

1053
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:58,420
He's gonna be like, legendary.

1054
01:51:02,690 --> 01:51:03,650
It's coming.

1055
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:06,650

I really only have one ult.

1060
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:20,480
It's like, yeah, well, if we win that, if we win that fight, he's just going to use legendary anyway.

1061
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:25,260
Oh my god, I should have just used it.

1062
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,340
Three are clicking Punisher.

1063
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:33,110
I should have just used it.

1064
01:52:33,150 --> 01:52:37,830
I was, I didn't think that, you know, he was going to ult that.

1065
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:41,190
I don't know.

1066
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:44,430
I didn't think he was gonna run into the Invis ult with it.

1067
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:47,630
I don't know.

1068
01:52:47,890 --> 01:53:02,050
I thought I don't know I legitimately thought like we all know we have to save my ult for Starlord Because no matter what I we will not live a Starlord ult Oh our fucking venom is dead

1069
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:12,070
God, oh God does he don't I don't think he knows.

1070
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:16,260
Okay.

1071
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:18,320
That's fine.

1072
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:21,680
Oh, there it is!

1073
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:23,060
There it is!

1074
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:24,640
That's why!

1075
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:28,080
That's why we have to save it!

1076
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:30,340
That's why!

1077
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:36,500
Oh my god.

1078
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,680
Wow, it's like the moment.

1079
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:42,040
The moment that he was lit.

1080
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,360
legendary.

1081
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,340
It's over for us.

1082
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:47,920
Oh, why did our venom leave?

1083
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,940
I needed the ult charge.

1084
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,660
Why did you leave?

1085
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:55,860
I'm really... Oh, my God.

1086
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:58,880
If our venom played with me, I could have got my ult.

1087
01:53:59,000 --> 01:53:59,680
Okay, that's fine.

1088
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:00,220
That's fine.

1089
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:01,420
That's fine.

1090
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:02,480
He lives for that.

1091
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:06,860
At least he's allowed for that, you know?

1092
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:15,020
Please kill the mag.

1093
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:18,120
I will do it myself and we have to.

1094
01:54:26,230 --> 01:54:27,510
Okay, there we go.

1095
01:54:30,610 --> 01:54:31,850
There we go.

1096
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:35,930
That was close.

1097
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:37,170
Yeah, that was close.

1098
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:42,130
I was just like, Invisible Woman, guys.

1099
01:54:44,910 --> 01:54:47,710
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

1100
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:49,890
That's the hard part.

1101
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:57,050
I want to hold up, but I also know, like, for the fucking legendary, but then my team is inting.

1102
01:54:59,490 --> 01:55:01,090
It's the worst part.

1103
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:06,590
D-Barrant, thank you for the 200 biddies, thank you, thank you.

1104
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:09,230
Variety watchers be like, oh, Marvel Rivals?

1105
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:10,210
Never heard of that game.

1106
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:10,890
Exactly!

1107
01:55:11,130 --> 01:55:15,770
And that's why I should be nominated as one of the best Marvel Rivals streamer.

1108
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:20,150
Because I'm literally advertising the game in other streams that are not Marvel Rivals.

1109
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:21,070
rivales.

1110
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:28,250
That's why I hope the panel the panel of judges notice that.

1111
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:37,590
I mean, like, I'm trying to go in with low expectations because I feel like you know, I feel like that's why that's one of the reasons why I wouldn't be nominated, you know?

1112
01:55:38,030 --> 01:55:41,670
That's one of the reasons why I think I won't be nominated just because of that.

1113
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:54,830
So yeah, I don't care about winning.

1114
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:55,930
I just wanted me up there.

1115
01:55:56,850 --> 01:56:19,090
Four, three, two one all you need to do is capture the mission area got it me there's a lot of people that deserves to be nominated too that's the thing there's also like a lot because if it was four people i can already like think of like four people that's not me getting nominated

1116
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:28,880
oh i hope i save the venom venom

1117
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:32,780
Where's...

1118
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:35,000
Oh, I was gonna say, where's our Emma?

1119
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,480
We don't have an Emma.

1120
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,940
I guess we don't need an Emma, question mark.

1121
01:56:47,530 --> 01:56:48,990
We don't need an Emma, I guess.

1122
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:54,760
That's fine.

1123
01:56:57,320 --> 01:56:59,800
Jesus Christ, what's going on in this hole?

1124
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:02,020
Woo!

1125
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:08,000
I guess we still don't need an Emma.

1126
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:15,800
Oh my god, we're both like sharing all children

1127
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:25,540
Okay, that's good because I was about to up the thing guy

1128
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:32,240
I'm really worried about the the Emma though.

1129
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:38,720
Oh, there you go Nice I can scratch myself

1130
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:42,890
All right.

1131
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:44,590
Oh, shit.

1132
01:57:45,290 --> 01:57:46,290
What the fuck?

1133
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:48,290
I did not expect all four of them to be there.

1134
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:49,470
I thought they left.

1135
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:54,950
I thought all these guys left already.

1136
01:57:58,690 --> 01:57:58,950
All right.

1137
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:00,830
I'm scared.

1138
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:01,970
That's okay.

1139
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:05,070
I think our venom will not be okay, but that's okay.

1140
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:10,150
Jesus Christ, there's so many things going on.

1141
01:58:10,630 --> 01:58:11,930
Oh my god, venom!

1142
01:58:12,110 --> 01:58:44,270

Oh my god.

1144
01:58:46,130 --> 01:58:47,090
Oh my god.

1145
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:49,090
Okay, they're 5.

1146
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:50,630
They're still 5.

1147
01:58:50,730 --> 01:58:51,190
You know what?

1148
01:58:51,230 --> 01:58:52,070
I'm gonna do something crazy.

1149
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:52,890
Watch this.

1150
01:58:55,310 --> 01:58:56,510
I'm dead.

1151
01:58:58,910 --> 01:59:00,850
Oh my god.

1152
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:09,470
I don't think that was supposed to happen.

1153
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:10,930
Oh my god.

1154
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:16,770
Oh my god.

1155
01:59:17,090 --> 01:59:17,790
Oh shit.

1156
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:19,010
Oh shit.

1157
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:21,450
Oh shit.

1158
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:21,490
Oh shit.

1159
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:23,430
You're fucking crazy.

1160
01:59:24,370 --> 01:59:24,630
What?

1161
01:59:26,670 --> 01:59:27,710
Okay, buddy.

1162
01:59:29,710 --> 01:59:31,810
What the fuck?

1163
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,070
Bro.

1164
01:59:35,010 --> 01:59:36,190
No, we, bro.

1165
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:43,070
I don't know what that was.

1166
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:49,890
I, I, I, I don't know what that was.

1167
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:53,990
Honestly, that was wild.

1168
01:59:58,610 --> 02:00:02,430
You know what would be easier if we haven't guys?

1169
02:00:06,350 --> 02:00:09,050
I feel like the game would be a lot easier.

1170
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:10,130
We had an Emma.

1171
02:00:11,790 --> 02:00:13,010
Just an FYI.

1172
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:21,930
Jesus Christ.

1173
02:00:23,970 --> 02:00:25,050
I had to use that.

1174
02:00:25,190 --> 02:00:26,750
I think I would have 100% died.

1175
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:29,730
If I didn't.

1176
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:33,820
Okay.

1177
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:37,640
I am a little bit worried.

1178
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:40,260
I don't think we're gonna win this.

1179
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:45,900
That's why I am a little bit worried.

1180
02:00:47,400 --> 02:01:19,740

Sorry, I had to go hog around.

1182
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:26,900
I could have saved the person on low ground, but that's not the fun part.

1183
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:30,740
Oh, yeah, no.

1184
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:34,000
Okay, thank God.

1185
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:37,760
If he hits me while I'm invisible, I will report him.

1186
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:43,260
I would 100% report that.

1187
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:48,500

There is higher feet.

1194
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:37,280
Legendary can exist right here.

1195
02:02:42,510 --> 02:02:44,650
Okay, but what if we do our own legendary?

1196
02:02:45,570 --> 02:02:46,050
You're right.

1197
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:48,070
Hey, guys.

1199
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:54,010
Because we need that for a ledge.

1200
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:55,610
Okay, we have legendary counter.

1201
02:02:56,150 --> 02:02:56,510

I think I'm playing pretty well.

1211
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:47,160
You're right, they should have surrendered so I could have more time.

1212
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,460
More time to queue up more games.

1213
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,620
I don't know why he's so barky.

1214
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:40,790
It's because he knows that, like, he knows they can't do anything about it because i would just ignore him so like and then he would be like oh yeah if i don't bark it like barking does like she can um i don't get anything if i'm barking but now now that i got a noise complaint i always have to like check up on him yeah he's rage baiting me he fucking knows i don't know his his water bowl is full he has his dinner yeah he barks for the love of the game he just wants my attention i think he's just attention barking which is what a do you can count on me all right oh nice no one's dead yet no one's dead this is rp survey my favorite but yeah i don't know why they're all in dps and not not the cool ones

He's so greedy.

1223
02:06:39,930 --> 02:06:41,350
I haven't played Art Raiders yet.

1224
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:42,750
I want to play it next week, though.

1225
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:47,070
But I want to take two days off on Sunday and Monday.

1226
02:06:47,410 --> 02:06:48,890
Just because, like...

1227
02:06:50,070 --> 02:07:08,730
I heard so it's really fun But I think the hardest part is just finding people to play Play it with, you know Only has three stack for it But like I need to find people who play FPS games For it I did ask like I asked Altair if he wants to Play it But I don't know if he can I gotta wait for that,

1228
02:07:08,790 --> 02:07:09,890

1233
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:02,260
I can't say what the sponsor is yet.

1234
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:06,820
This is one of their sponsors where like, when they announce it, I can announce it.

1235
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:12,440
So, so I got, oh wait, I do have a sponsor next week.

1236
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:15,200
It's really nice though.

1237
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:25,260
It's, it's really nice though to, you know, be able to have, uh, uh, sponsor streams every other week or so.

1238
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:35,080
Because, you know, they're like additional income type, you And, you know, companies like it when I show their stuff, which makes me happy.

1239
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:42,040
Makes me happy that companies like it when I, you know, advertise their things.

1240
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:45,480
It means I'm marketable.

1241
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:46,440
It makes me happy.

1242
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,940
And I think, and I hope that you guys have fun, too.

1243
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:53,460
Even if it's a sponsor stream.

1244
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:54,240
I hope you guys enjoy.

1245
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:55,320
Oh, they have a Venom.

1246
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:56,100

I lied confidently.

1251
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:38,060
Oh my god.

1252
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:39,380
That was such a big lie.

1253
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:46,820
Has our Spider-Man done anything yet?

1254
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:49,900
I don't know.

1255
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:53,560
I don't think our Spider-Man has done it.

1256
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:56,100
Well, to be fair, our entire team hasn't done anything yet.

1257
02:09:56,540 --> 02:09:57,440
Other than us killing.

1258
02:09:57,740 --> 02:09:59,020
Oh my god, we did something!

1259
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:00,580
Four of them over here.

1260
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:06,740
Hello.

1261
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:07,240
Hello.

1262
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:08,310
Get ready to get eaten.

1263
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:13,160
Oh, goodbye.

1264
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:15,990
This is where we die.

1265
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:24,370
No, I...

1266
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:26,060
No, zero kill.

1267
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:31,500
The Spider-Man had the fucking snowflake the entire time.

1268
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:53,160
and we did nothing with it so I'm swapping off of Luna that should yeah be fair the other map is better for spider-man I hate this map because it's so laggy I'm begging bro

1269
02:10:57,020 --> 02:11:05,800
all right did they get him did they get him

1270
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:11,100
Jesus, what happened?

1271
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,580
Oh my, no, this map sucks.

1272
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:21,500
This map fucking sucks.

1273
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:25,380
This map gives the most raindrops.

1274
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:26,120
I don't know why.

1275
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:26,900
Look at that.

1276
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,080
Oh, it's so gross.

1277
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:28,640
It's so gross.

1278
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:35,260
This map, for some reason, is so poorly optimized.

1279
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:39,380
It's so poorly optimized.

1280
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:44,900
I have a 550 90 and I still get like that's that is such insane brain drop.

1281
02:11:47,140 --> 02:11:50,860
Like I should not be getting brain drops like this.

1282
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:51,320
That's fine.

1283
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:53,100
That's fine.

1284
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:56,860
Please all before we start dying here.

1285
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:00,540
Is that what you want guys?

1286
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:03,500

You...

1294
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:40,080
You didn't confess.

1295
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:41,120
I bet it was you.

1296
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:45,620
You and you didn't even confess.

Okay.

1306
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:19,360
Control lost.

1307
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:23,280
Their team's capture progress has passed the halfway point.

1308
02:16:23,660 --> 02:16:23,820
Kidding.

1309
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,420
God damn it.

1310
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:26,400
I even get one guide on my own team.

1311
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:27,920
God damn it.

1312
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:34,500
I even get one guide in a team game.

1313
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:39,180
That's right.

1314
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:39,800
Exactly.

1315
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:42,180
You would take the blame.

1316
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:43,880
Even if it was my fault.

1317
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:51,360
Oh my god.

1318
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:52,020
Alright.

1319
02:17:01,050 --> 02:17:02,150
That's looking right.

1320
02:17:02,730 --> 02:17:03,750
Oh my god.

1321
02:17:04,630 --> 02:17:05,700
God damn it.

1322
02:17:06,570 --> 02:17:07,230
Goodbye.

1323
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:13,190
Okay, you're an actual dragon would one guy me.

1324
02:17:14,230 --> 02:17:14,670
Oh, where's he?

1325
02:17:14,810 --> 02:17:15,670
Oh my god.

1326
02:17:16,550 --> 02:17:17,210
Oh,

1327
02:17:21,130 --> 02:17:22,090
he was one.

1328
02:17:22,390 --> 02:17:23,670
Okay, I almost got him.

1329
02:17:26,250 --> 02:17:27,510
He was one, too.

1330
02:17:27,590 --> 02:17:28,370
I'm so sad.

1331
02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:30,830
At least my team got him.

1332
02:17:36,530 --> 02:17:38,570
No, I should have just went in this instantly.

1333
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:41,210
I thought I would eat someone else, but went for me.

1334
02:17:44,090 --> 02:17:45,650
I don't even know who is.

1335
02:17:45,730 --> 02:17:47,050
He's shit talking to.

1336
02:17:47,550 --> 02:17:50,670
It can't be me because I won my last four games.

1337
02:17:55,870 --> 02:18:01,450
That's why I changed it when, uh, you're terrible.

1338
02:18:01,890 --> 02:18:04,890
Okay, no, our Spider-Man, I don't know if our Spider-Man did anything.

1339
02:18:05,430 --> 02:18:14,310
I, oh, no, I'm sorry, bro.

1340
02:18:14,450 --> 02:18:16,670
I know you said big fan, but like, I'm sorry.

1341
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:18,590
Wait, actually, 4K?

1342
02:18:19,210 --> 02:18:22,430
Okay, no, actually, no, you did your best.

1343
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:23,430
You had 12K.

1344
02:18:23,750 --> 02:18:24,750
No, four, I just noticed.

1345
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:25,470
No, I'm sorry.

1346
02:18:25,570 --> 02:18:25,850
No, you did.

1347

1349
02:19:25,490 --> 02:19:33,370
yeah and I was the only one with the thing is I I remember pressing tab, and only me and Rocket had us.

1350
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:39,270
So I was like, I assumed he was talking about us, because I looked at her.

1351
02:19:39,570 --> 02:19:43,590
Oh, I pressed tab, and I was like, okay, he's talking about us, right?

1352
02:19:43,630 --> 02:19:45,350
Because only Rocket and I had us.

1353
02:19:48,470 --> 02:19:49,350
So, yeah.

1354
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:52,030
Yeah.

1355
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:58,640
Okay, good.

1356
02:19:58,680 --> 02:19:59,740
I'm not going crazy.

1357
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:01,260
I thought I was going crazy.

1358
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:03,620
No, I just thought, I was like, what the fuck?

1359
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:06,100
Like, why did everyone blame me?

1360
02:20:06,420 --> 02:20:08,540
Did we not hear the same cop?

1361
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:11,720
I just need to know if I'm going crazy or not.

1362
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:15,120
I need to know if I'm getting gaslit, guys.

1363
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:18,080
Because I'm the one that's supposed to do the gaslighting.

1364
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:18,920
Not them.

1365
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:24,560
I had to know if I was getting gaslit or not.

1366
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,320
Hey, guard the galaxy, sure.

1367
02:20:26,860 --> 02:20:30,040
But sometimes we take stuff other people are guarding.

1368
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:55,060
And then I was explained it and then no one said anything No one was like, yeah, I heard that too Like no one defended me Like they're like Everyone just Everyone just stopped talking after I said that So I was like, I'm not going crazy Why did I didn't know what Why did no one back me up

1369
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:05,920
They got scared Yeah They were in on it.

1370
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:06,940
They were in on it.

1371
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,660
The only thing that can cheer me up is to dance.

1372
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:14,620
This is the only way.

1373
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:19,580
I'm just enjoying the- What the fuck, bro!

1374

1375
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:23,320
Why?

1376
02:21:37,650 --> 02:21:38,830
It's fine.

1377
02:21:43,870 --> 02:21:46,450
They just got him.

1378
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:48,450
What do you mean they got him?

1379
02:21:48,630 --> 02:21:50,390
They just, yeah, they just got him.

1380
02:21:50,690 --> 02:21:52,490
And the one and done.

1381
02:21:55,630 --> 02:21:57,310
Refuse to elaborate.

1382
02:21:59,430 --> 02:22:00,250
You want to come in?

1383
02:22:00,690 --> 02:22:00,970
No?

1384
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:01,590
No.

1385
02:22:02,970 --> 02:22:03,490
No.

1386
02:22:04,430 --> 02:22:04,590
No.

1387
02:22:05,590 --> 02:22:05,750
No.

1388
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:06,130
No.

1389
02:22:06,590 --> 02:22:06,710
No.

1390
02:22:08,130 --> 02:22:09,270
I don't have food.

1391
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:09,710
Okay.

1392
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:12,430
He wants to use my bed, I'm pretty sure.

1393
02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:14,230
Yeah, I got him banned.

1394
02:22:14,610 --> 02:22:17,450
He broke my pole, and now he's gone.

1395
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:32,440
What the fuck?

1396
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:33,600
Who shot me?

1397
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:37,780
What the fuck shot me?

1398
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:40,220
Bro, toss defenses.

1399
02:22:41,180 --> 02:22:42,880
I wasn't even armed.

1400
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,740
Oh, I wasn't even shot.

1401
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,240
I just got beat up to death.

1402
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:47,960
Okay.

1403
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:56,240
That's different.

1404
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:01,160
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

1405
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:08,120
Alright, here we go.

1406
02:23:11,950 --> 02:23:15,510
Alright, let's be a little bit stressed out by playing Luna.

1407
02:23:16,770 --> 02:23:18,770
Oh yeah, no, Jeff Miff sucks on this map.

1408
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:19,430
I agree.

1409
02:23:19,670 --> 02:23:20,790
No, get him out of here.

1410
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:21,890
He's sucking.

1411
02:23:22,770 --> 02:23:24,410
He's so oppressive on this map.

1412
02:23:24,490 --> 02:23:27,590
He's so good at, like, cough maps in general.

1413
02:23:30,270 --> 02:23:32,490
Get that guy out of here.

1414
02:23:39,190 --> 02:24:56,270
it's so interesting to see people do the um what is it the meta the new twitch meta where um everybody like all the the i guess like um semi small to semi big streamers just combine their view accounts together so they can be on top of the page it's so like i mean that's really smart that's really smart because when you're on the top of the category you know people just click on the first stream usually yeah collab but no collab love the name dad oh his name i named my dog after myself which is doki because i guess i'm an eagle maniac uh i just i love myself so much that i named them after myself so um but and then like i i call him like doki Doge or do it like sometimes I call him as amber like before then um and so I was like oh I'll call him doky amber doge um but so and then people were like oh that's abbreviated it's dad yeah everyone's like oh my god that's dad and that's just easier to say you know because so so like people won't get confused between me Dokey bird the bird and

1415
02:24:56,270 --> 02:25:00,790
doky doge the dog so you know when I say Doki, like, people will know, oh, she's talking about herself.

1416
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:03,730
When I say, dad, people will know I'm talking about my dog.

1417
02:25:10,810 --> 02:25:18,230
All right, here we go.

1418
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:28,590
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

1419
02:25:31,140 --> 02:25:34,780

02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:10,900
There's no way they'll know I'm here.

1423
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:14,860
Bro, I'm trying.

1424
02:26:16,900 --> 02:26:18,240
Bro, you have snowflake.

You have as much resources.

1426
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:21,540
You have so many resources.

1427
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:24,220
You literally have resources for days.

1428
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:27,620
Oh my god.

1429
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:30,820
Just a little bit too much.

1430
02:26:36,270 --> 02:26:39,430
I just need you to know you have so much resources.

1431
02:26:39,650 --> 02:27:18,190

1433

Oh my god.

1434
02:27:52,550 --> 02:27:53,650
Okay, I was gonna say, if I reflect...

1435
02:27:58,490 --> 02:28:02,910
Okay, I looked away for one second.

1436
02:28:06,990 --> 02:28:10,590
There is like 20 people around us, so...

1437
02:28:10,610 --> 02:28:15,490
Um, there is, like, I don't know, a Namor behind me.

1438
02:28:20,010 --> 02:28:23,270
I will say I am doing a lot of healing.

1439
02:28:24,110 --> 02:28:25,870
I just can't kill everything.

1440
02:28:27,630 --> 02:28:28,590
I just...

1441
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:31,750
Unfortunately...

1442
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:35,490
Unfortunately, like, I can't kill everything.

1443
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:40,230
There happens to be a bit too many people that need healing.

1444
02:28:43,230 --> 02:28:46,090
Just a little bit unfortunate.

1445
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:01,480
Alright.

1446
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:05,780
Let's just hope that we can hide from the...

1447
02:29:10,600 --> 02:29:11,480
Alright.

1448
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:14,700
Oh.

1449
02:29:20,570 --> 02:29:21,910
There you go.

1450
02:29:23,010 --> 02:29:23,590
I...

1451
02:29:23,590 --> 02:29:25,590
I don't even know.

1452
02:29:26,130 --> 02:29:28,910
I... I don't even know how he died.

1453
02:29:31,390 --> 02:29:33,890
I'd be very honest with you.

1454
02:29:34,450 --> 02:29:36,350
I don't even know how that happened.

1455
02:29:40,950 --> 02:29:44,950
Like, it's actually crazy how you died there.

1456
02:29:47,530 --> 02:29:52,450
Like, our DPS must have, like, the worst positioning possible.

1457
02:29:52,930 --> 02:29:54,950
Like, I don't know.

1458
02:29:57,010 --> 02:29:59,110
Like, I am, I need to know.

1459
02:29:59,210 --> 02:30:01,250
What is the positioning of our DPS?

1460
02:30:03,750 --> 02:30:07,480
Oh god, oh, I looked up the wrong way

1461
02:30:15,070 --> 02:30:16,230
Jesus Christ

1462
02:30:20,710 --> 02:30:24,050
I am trying my best

1463
02:30:32,010 --> 02:30:38,890
Please Oh my god, please We should win this technically

1464
02:30:45,170 --> 02:30:48,750
Oh my god, I did that push up that century.

1465
02:30:49,350 --> 02:30:53,210
I, no, we, I'm going to say it.

1466
02:30:53,610 --> 02:30:55,670
We don't deserve to win this.

1467
02:30:57,110 --> 02:31:00,990
Our team is so much more worse.

1468
02:31:01,550 --> 02:31:08,710
I think our team is, uh, it's not as good.

1469
02:31:09,310 --> 02:31:10,470
We do not.

1470
02:31:49,510 --> 02:31:50,910
We did not deserve.

1471
02:31:52,290 --> 02:31:58,530
This is, this is, this is not, I do not believe this is a healer issue.

1472
02:31:58,690 --> 02:32:09,910
I, I, bro, there is no way, there is no way they're complaining about healing.

1473
02:32:12,610 --> 02:32:15,530
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1474
02:32:15,970 --> 02:32:19,430
We don't know that, you know, you do not deserve to spam that.

1475
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:21,210
this bad.

1476
02:32:21,670 --> 02:32:24,170
How the fuck would the healer be positioned there?

1477
02:32:27,230 --> 02:32:31,470
Like, you all, like, would you want me to be in the front line?

1478
02:32:31,630 --> 02:32:34,310
Like, there's no way you think I would be there.

1479
02:32:34,610 --> 02:32:37,190
There's no way why would you think I'd play there?

1480
02:32:37,570 --> 02:32:39,810
Why would you think I'd play there?

1481
02:32:43,710 --> 02:32:47,150
There's no way I get blamed for that.

1482
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:59,310
this is real firepower oh he matched it guys he matched it

1483
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:12,210
no no no no

1484
02:33:20,910 --> 02:33:31,090
They are not gaslighting me to think I played wrong I I refuse to be gaslit and thinking I fucked up there

1485
02:33:41,630 --> 02:33:47,610
No, no rocket has to look rocket has to look I have to look at this

1486
02:33:51,110 --> 02:33:53,250
Rocket has to look at you.

1487
02:33:53,950 --> 02:33:54,910
Not me.

1488
02:34:03,990 --> 02:34:06,330
It is gaslight.

1489
02:34:06,710 --> 02:34:08,370
We all saw his...

1490
02:34:08,370 --> 02:34:09,650
We all saw their positioning.

1491
02:34:10,170 --> 02:34:11,350
There is no way I...

1492
02:34:11,350 --> 02:34:13,730
They are begging for heals there.

1493
02:34:16,910 --> 02:34:18,650
I know what I saw.

1494
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:33,260
Okay, that's fine.

1495
02:34:35,420 --> 02:34:36,440
That's fine.

1496
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:39,560
There you go.

1497
02:34:40,520 --> 02:34:42,020
No, not just the Hella.

1498
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:43,720
That's not just the Hella.

1499
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:45,580
It's the Hella and the neighbor.

1500
02:34:46,700 --> 02:34:47,220
It's...

1501
02:34:47,220 --> 02:34:54,080
It was both of them.

1502
02:34:54,420 --> 02:34:57,120
And I was like, there is no way you think I should be there.

1503
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:04,840
We all saw the positioning there.

1504
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:06,800
Why the fuck would I be there?

1505
02:35:15,430 --> 02:35:17,850
The unusual comforts.

1506
02:35:22,370 --> 02:35:23,310
Round two.

1507
02:35:23,630 --> 02:35:26,510
Even when you can't see me, I'll still make you believe me.

1508
02:35:26,510 --> 02:35:28,970
Oh god, they won me so bad.

1509
02:35:32,310 --> 02:35:41,910
like a jealous x right now it's like the joker when he calls when he calls batman like 70 times

Oh, God.

1520
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:13,360
Oh, God.

1521
02:38:14,340 --> 02:38:14,720
Oh, God.

1522
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:19,320
Okay.

1523
02:38:22,140 --> 02:38:23,300
Oh, my God.

1524
02:38:23,720 --> 02:38:23,720
Okay.

1525
02:38:24,640 --> 02:38:25,160
Okay, if we

1526
02:38:29,890 --> 02:38:34,310
go here, we fight here.

1527
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:48,420
All right, to be fair, I thought our rocket get what all after me.

1528
02:38:55,220 --> 02:38:57,140
Yeah, you got a damage boosted.

1529
02:39:08,220 --> 02:39:10,100
Yeah, I was not living that.

1530
02:39:14,140 --> 02:39:16,120
That was a lot of damage.

1531
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:20,680
Like, I am doing so much healing.

1532
02:39:24,300 --> 02:39:30,000
And I feel like if I was on any other support, I would not be able to heal everybody.

1533
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:35,880
Because thank God they're all like walk, they're all like in the same line too.

1534
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:37,660
How?

1535
02:39:38,340 --> 02:39:40,080
There is no way.

1536
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:42,340
You're getting that.

1537
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:43,760
That's all you're getting.

1538
02:39:46,940 --> 02:39:47,520
That's...

1539
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:50,240
You're getting that.

1540
02:39:56,390 --> 02:39:57,830
Oh my god.

1541
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:03,880
Alright.

1542
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:22,900
it's fine what we did yeah I was like I for one guy the thing is I can't babysit him because both my tanks are up front so I have to like walk up to them

1543
02:40:37,630 --> 02:40:44,090
alright alright They don't know where I am.

1544
02:40:44,150 --> 02:40:45,270
Ha ha ha ha!

1545
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:55,780
Jesus Christ.

1546
02:40:57,140 --> 02:40:58,660
There's so much damage, right?

1547
02:41:02,500 --> 02:41:03,100
Alright.

1548
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:04,360
That's fine.

1549
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:06,020
We live to tell...

1550
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:07,440
That's fine.

1551
02:41:07,580 --> 02:41:09,500
We live to tell another story.

1552
02:41:12,900 --> 02:41:13,200
Oh!

1553
02:41:13,820 --> 02:41:14,260
Okay.

1554
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:20,560
I already have almost 50k healing.

1555
02:41:21,060 --> 02:41:23,220
I think if we go over time, it'd be 60.

1556
02:41:24,780 --> 02:41:27,540
I actually almost have 50k healings.

1557
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:38,240
Thank God he's not talking to me.

1558
02:41:50,140 --> 02:41:50,960
Do reload, please.

1559
02:41:55,130 --> 02:41:56,190
Please, I can't!

1560
02:41:56,530 --> 02:41:56,930
I...

1561
02:42:00,170 --> 02:42:00,610
Okay.

1562
02:42:05,430 --> 02:42:06,010
All right.

1563
02:42:06,770 --> 02:42:08,470
I didn't know that majority of them were dead.

1564
02:42:09,530 --> 02:42:09,970
I...

1565
02:42:09,970 --> 02:42:12,230
Oh, that's unlucky.

1566
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:17,990
Oh, I should have saved that.

1567
02:42:18,450 --> 02:42:19,310
I got scared.

1568
02:42:20,030 --> 02:42:23,670
I didn't want to peek it, so I thought there were like 20 people still alive.

1569
02:42:26,110 --> 02:42:29,030
I legitimately thought there were 20 people still alive over there.

1570
02:42:29,450 --> 02:42:30,690
I got too scared to peek it.

1571
02:42:34,990 --> 02:42:37,210
Oh, what the fuck?

1572
02:42:40,830 --> 02:42:42,290
There's no way I died because of you.

1573
02:42:43,210 --> 02:42:44,110
I refuse to...

1574
02:42:45,970 --> 02:42:46,910
Oh my god.

1575
02:42:55,050 --> 02:42:57,790
Okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.

1576
02:43:00,830 --> 02:43:03,390
I was like, I refuse to die for you.

1577
02:43:03,510 --> 02:43:05,550
I'm in a hallway now.

1578
02:43:06,010 --> 02:43:07,850
And he took the health back too.

1579
02:43:08,230 --> 02:43:10,290
And he fucking took the health back.

1580
02:43:17,550 --> 02:43:22,770
I was like, I will not die for this man.

1581
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:29,930
I get 19 for that, too.

1582
02:43:30,030 --> 02:43:31,950
That's the fucking worst part.

1583
02:43:32,450 --> 02:43:36,530
I got 19 for the fucking insane play I had to do.

1584
02:43:37,170 --> 02:43:40,490
What is it?

1585
02:43:40,570 --> 02:43:41,030
Huh?

1586
02:43:41,770 --> 02:43:42,070
Huh?

1587
02:43:42,650 --> 02:43:42,850
Huh?

1588
02:43:44,790 --> 02:43:46,290
Oh my god.

1589
