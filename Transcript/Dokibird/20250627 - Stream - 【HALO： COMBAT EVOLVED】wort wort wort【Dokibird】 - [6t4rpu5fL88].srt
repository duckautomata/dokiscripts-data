1
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,790
Sorry, guys.

2
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,810
Oh, wait.

3
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,010
This is my recording set.

4
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,710
God damn it.

5
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,750
I can't keep... God.

6
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,610
Okay.

7
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,130
Sorry.

8
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,610
Let me restart that.

9
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,270
Sorry, guys.

10
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:03,070
I was like, why am I so quiet?

11
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,190
I was like, oh, shit.

12
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,430
I'm still... I'm on my recording... recording settings again.

13
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,350
And I'm... I'm being very sleepy.

14
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,590
I can't.

15
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:31,110
Yeah, I took a nap again today because for the first time, for the first time, I actually slept late at, like, 4 a.m.

16
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,990
last night or today.

17
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,610
Because yesterday, I also napped.

18
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:53,430
So I'm creating a really bad cycle right now because it's really bad because this fucker right next to me right now likes to wake up at 6 to 7 in the morning for food time.

19
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,290
And he's been very, very, very demanding.

20
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,250
I've sent emails to two different trainers and have yet to receive a response.

21
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,450
So...

22
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,190
That's great.

23
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,470
So I didn't get a lot of sleep today.

24
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:25,830
So that's why I took another nap, even though I know it's a very bad idea to take a nap and wake up right before stream because I get even more extra EP before stream.

25
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,370
My brain takes a while.

26
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,630
My brain takes a while to, like, wake up.

27
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,770
There's also apparently a dog.

28
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:47,870
I think someone got a new dog and he's been, like, a little yapper as well and he's been, like, barking outside his door and dad is like, who the fuck is that guy?

29
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,150
I want to fight him.

30
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:55,330
So, he's been barking as well outside my door because that little guy's creating a fucking loop.

31
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:06,630
So, um, no, I could tell from the yelps, I could tell from the yelps that it is, like, goddamn Poodle Terrier.

32
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:17,210
Like, you can tell exactly how, like, what kind of breeds they are depending on their barks and, like, I know what a Poodle Terrier bark is.

33
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:31,690
Okay, so, by the way, it's actually pretty funny because, like, remember when I was telling you guys how I was looking up, my manager gave this crazy idea where it's, like, high risk, high reward where, like, maybe I should get two dogs.

34
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:41,610
Maybe I should get another dog so they could, like, so, like, maybe dad will stop bothering me and stop barking at me if he has, like, another friend.

35
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:49,650
And the risk is that maybe the risk would be those two working together to fuck me over.

36
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:04,130
But, like, I have to tell you guys that I was looking at adoption websites, like, in my city, and, like, literally, there are no wiener dogs.

37
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:13,150
Because I told you guys, like, there's no way someone would put a wiener dog up for adoption because they're, despite them being, like, pieces of shit.

38
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:26,310
They are purebreds and, um, they're very, very expensive dog breeds because, like, um, yeah, they are very expensive.

39
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:34,550
So, no one would, like, put them in a pound because of how, uh, how valued they are.

40
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,130
But, you know what I did see on the adoption websites?

41
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,690
A lot of fucking poodle terriers.

42
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,630
I swear to God.

43
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:55,370
It was, like, it was, like, 30% chihuahuas, 30%, uh, pit bulls, and then 30% poodle terriers.

44
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,770
And then when I looked up dachshunds, it was, like, they were, like, mixed with other dog breeds.

45
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,150
Like, they're, like, yeah, this is, like, a chihuahua, a dachshund.

46
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,790
I was, like, no, I don't want, like, two little shits mixed together because then it produces, like, an even worse...

47
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,070
An even worse attitude slash personality.

48
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,270
Um...

49
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,750
Sharko, thank you for the super chat.

50
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,730
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,790
Hey, Doki, I love your summer outfit.

52
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,970
It kind of reminds me of Ace Ventura a bit.

53
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,870
But today, also today, I found Starscream and Megatron Yaoi doujin.

54
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,650
I could not read because it's Japanese.

55
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,450
Thank you for the super chat.

56
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:38,870
Thank you.

57
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,930
That is a wild super chat.

58
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,430
But, like, who the fuck reads the doujins for...

59
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,490
Who the fuck reads doujins for the text?

60
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,270
And the story.

61
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,070
You, we all know.

62
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,350
I know you all read doujins for the artwork.

63
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,790
Like, who the fuck cares about what the text says?

64
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,570
Like...

65
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,530
The pod.

66
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,730
Thank you for the super chat.

67
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,210
Thank you.

68
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,070
Thank you.

69
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,490
No, no.

70
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,350
Thank you, the super chat.

71
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,670
Thank you.

72
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,250
Thank you.

73
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,370
Hi, Doki.

74
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,510
Had a great time.

75
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,690
I've walked out and seen your panel.

76
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,170
Uh, will you ever confirm the night of question?

77
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:21,830
Uh, okay.

78
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,890
Thank you for the super chat.

79
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,270
Thank you.

80
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,850
Thank you.

81
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,230
Uh...

82
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,430
Not missing now.

83
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,410
Thank you for the super chat.

84
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,390
Thank you.

85
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,410
Hey, Doki.

86
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,810
Today is my first birthday.

87
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,330
It's a dragon.

88
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,330
Can I get a happy birthday from my Oshi?

89
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,350
Of course you can.

90
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,550
Happy birthday to you.

91
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,650
Happy birthday to you.

92
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,010
Happy birthday, dear Missing.

93
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,930
Happy birthday to you.

94
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,450
Yeah!

95
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,390
Happy birthday!

96
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,490
Yeah!

97
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,190
All right.

98
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,770
So, that update.

99
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,450
There's actually a lot of dad updates that's been happening.

100
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,650
But I'm going to, like, space these stories out.

101
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,190
I'm going to run out of dad updates.

102
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,710
Because, like, how many stories can I say when he's, like, at the dog park?

103
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,750
Or, like, how many new things can possibly happen?

104
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:08,810
Um...

105
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,130
Anyway.

106
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:09,890
Oh, man.

107
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,730
I'm trying to figure out which one to give you guys.

108
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,150
Because I wrote down all the...

109
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,810
I write down, like, all these updates and stuff when I'm, like, out, like, on my phone.

110
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,010
So I don't forget.

111
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,270
Uh...

112
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:20,690
Okay.

113
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,590
All right.

114
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:23,990
Okay.

115
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,430
I'll tell you guys the dad up the ball incident.

116
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,350
Okay.

117
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,790
So, um...

118
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,170
Yesterday.

119
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,750
This is from yesterday, too.

120
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:34,890
Uh...

121
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,770
Yesterday, um...

122
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:42,330
I've started bringing his ball with me to the dog park.

123
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,430
Because, like, um...

124
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,570
I was tired of him trying to steal other dogs' balls.

125
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,490
And then also, like, I needed him to, like, get his energy down more.

126
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,470
Because he has been having way too much energy.

127
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,770
I think it's the food.

128
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,810
I think the wet dog food has been giving him too much energy.

129
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,450
Um...

130
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,870
Because he used to be, like, such a calm boy.

131
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,470
Like, he used to be, like, more of a lazy dog.

132
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,770
But nowadays, he has, like, way too much energy.

133
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,650
And I think it's the wet dog food.

134
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:17,750
Um...

135
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,430
I even, like, asked the vet if I could, like, swap it back to, like, dry food.

136
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,050
Like, kibble.

137
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,750
And my vet said that it is possible.

138
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,690
I just need to put...

139
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,390
Uh...

140
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,850
I just need to put, like, water...

141
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,910
Um...

142
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,610
Water into the dry food.

143
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,410
So that he'll get, like, moisture and stuff.

144
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,230
Um...

145
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,810
For his kidneys.

146
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,390
So, like, I'm planning on doing that, uh...

147
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:38,890
Next week.

148
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,930
Because I still have a lot of wet dog food left.

149
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,410
So, um...

150
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,710
And, like, they're very expensive.

151
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,930
They cost me, like, a hundred dollars for two weeks.

152
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,430
So, like, it's...

153
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,550
Because, you know, I'm sure it tastes a lot better.

154
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:57,730
Uh...

155
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,330
Yeah.

156
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,150
Anyway.

157
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,070
No!

158
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,010
He will be so...

159
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,750
He'll forget.

160
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,790
He'll forget about it.

161
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,810
He'll live.

162
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:06,570
Anyway.

163
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,430
Anyway.

164
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,910
So, um...

165
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,570
So, I've been trying to bring his ball with me down at the dog park.

166
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,530
So he won't steal other people's balls.

167
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,630
And so...

168
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,270
And then, like, we could play fetch and stuff.

169
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,410
So he'll, like...

170
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,150
Uh...

171
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,110
He'll, like, waste his energy more.

172
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,670
So, I went downstairs and, like, headed to the dog park with his ball.

173
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,390
And, you know, I decided.

174
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:28,950
I was like, alright.

175
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,530
It's time to play fetch time.

176
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,650
It's fetch time.

177
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,190
And then, um...

178
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,090
I threw the ball.

179
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,830
And at first, like, the first two throws, it was alright.

180
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,990
He's like, yippee!

181
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,830
Fetch time!

182
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,190
And then another dog...

183
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,550
Twoking it...

184
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,570
Came in.

185
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,730
And then stole his ball.

186
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,320
And...

187
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,580
And, obviously, he was not happy about that.

188
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,280
He was very, very mad.

189
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,860
But, like, he couldn't do anything about it.

190
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,200
Because this dog was, like, bigger than him.

191
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,000
He was, like...

192
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,400
It was, like, an actual poodle.

193
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,160
It wasn't...

194
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,740
Like, actually, no.

195
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,500
He was, like, the big poodle terriers.

196
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,000
Not, like, poodle poodle.

197
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,920
But they were, like, the big poodle terriers.

198
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,500
Not the small poodle terriers.

199
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,300
It's always poodle terriers.

200
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,020
Anyway!

201
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,460
So...

202
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,780
The ones that are, like, mostly legs.

203
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,200
You know?

204
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:32,940
Like...

205
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,120
So...

206
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,380
So that was a problem.

207
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,860
And then, so...

208
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,620
The owner was, like...

209
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,300
Oh, okay.

210
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,440
The owner was, like...

211
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,900
Oh, don't worry.

212
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,240
I brought my own ball, too.

213
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,540
Like, in case this happens.

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,740
So then, like...

215
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,560
He threw his own ball.

216
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,000
And then...

217
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,760
Dad stole that one.

218
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,780
Because he was, like...

219
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,660
You're gonna steal my ball?

220
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,340
I'm gonna steal your ball.

221
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,240
You take mine.

222
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,360
I take yours.

223
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,080
And then...

224
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,400
And then...

225
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,560
It was a huge issue.

226
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,540
Because...

227
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,300
He wouldn't let go.

228
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,200
This was...

229
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,240
The first time...

230
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,040
He's never let go of a ball before.

231
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,520
Because he always wants to play fetch.

232
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,080
So every time I just, like...

233
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,680
You know...

234
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:28,660
I...

235
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,700
Put my hand down.

236
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,820
And go, what ball?

237
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,980
And then he'll, like...

238
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,800
Give me the ball.

239
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,560
But for the first time...

240
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,260
He refused to let go.

241
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,880
And, like...

242
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,380
And, like...

243
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,040
I was like, okay...

244
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,240
Maybe this is just a phase.

245
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,400
Maybe he's just, like...

246
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,620
Incredibly paranoid that, like...

247
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,780
Another dog is gonna steal at this again.

248
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,880
So he, like...

249
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,580
Didn't wanna, like...

250
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:48,980
Let go.

251
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,320
Because he was like...

252
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,640
My ball's keep getting stolen!

253
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,140
This ball stays in my mouth!

254
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,180
So...

255
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,240
Because I was, like...

256
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,820
I was, like...

257
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,440
Trying to...

258
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:02,620
You know...

259
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,740
I can't pull too hard.

260
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,380
Because it's back.

261
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:04,960
So I was just like...

262
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,280
Come on!

263
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,100
And then I just, like...

264
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,780
Pulled it a little bit.

265
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,180
He's like...

266
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,600
No!

267
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:07,680
No!

268
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,060
Like...

269
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,520
And he was just, like...

270
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,500
He was just, like...

271
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,620
Fighting hard on that ball.

272
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,000
I was like...

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,520
No!

274
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
And pulling it back.

275
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:15,780
I was like...

276
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,120
This is mine!

277
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,260
And then...

278
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,940
So...

279
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,600
Um...

280
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
I let him, like...

281
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,280
You know...

282
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,120
Think about it.

283
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,840
For, like...

284
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,640
Ten minutes.

285
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
But then the other...

286
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,440
The owner had to go.

287
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,520
And he was, like...

288
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,020
Hey...

289
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,780
Can we, like...

290
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,340
You know...

291
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:30,980
Trade balls?

292
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,500
Like...

293
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,760
I got your ball back.

294
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,580
I was, like...

295
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,180
Oh, yeah.

296
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,500
No.

297
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,100
No problem.

298
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,420
Yeah.

299
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,900
I think it'll be fine.

300
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:46,120
And so, like, I picked him up and then I tried, you know, pulling the ball, but he, like, wouldn't let go.

301
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,160
He was like, no!

302
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,480
I was like, and then the owner, like, gave me his ball back.

303
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,080
I was like, look, look, Dad, I've got your ball here.

304
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,760
Come on, let go of the other one.

305
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,800
And he's like, come on!

306
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,660
He's like, no!

307
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,380
And he still was, like, holding on to it.

308
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,200
I literally had him in my arms.

309
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:23,420
I sat down on the bench just trying to pull the ball out and trying to, like, you know, I was trying to pull the ball out, but it was, like, literally locked into his jaw.

310
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,120
And I was like, do you see this?

311
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,680
Here's your ball.

312
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,660
Do you see this?

313
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,920
This is your ball.

314
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,880
And he's like, no!

315
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,420
Like, he never let go.

316
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:49,000
And then, so then the other owner was like, oh, well, um, you can, like, you know, whenever we see each other again, like, I don't know, we see each other dog part a lot, just, you could just, yeah, give it back to us whenever, like, you're on your walk.

317
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,560
I was like, I'm so sorry.

318
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,500
He, he's, he would, he, he's used to, he, he's always gives the ball back.

319
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,780
Like, I don't know why he doesn't want to today.

320
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,420
I'm so sorry.

321
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,420
Like, he's never done that before.

322
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,840
He was like, he would always, like, play fetch with me, because I'd be like, pop-ball, and he'll, like, drop the ball in my hand or on the floor.

323
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,520
But this time, he, like, refused to let go.

324
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,700
And I think he's just extremely paranoid about, like, other dogs trying to steal his ball now.

325
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:31,400
And then, so, they left, and then, and then he was still, like, he still had it in his, like, he still had it in his mouth.

326
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:38,900
And then, I swear to God, okay, so, like, all the dogs left at that point, because I was just like, okay, I'm just gonna wait, because I'm waiting for him to poop.

327
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:47,060
I'm not fucking, the last time I, like, went back to, uh, my apartment without him pooping, because he took to a dog, he, like, pooped in the hallway.

328
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,820
So, I've just been, like, waiting.

329
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,740
I think he was, like, really paranoid.

330
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,340
He's like, if I let go of this ball, someone's gonna steal it.

331
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,480
So I'm gonna wait until every dog is gone until I go poop.

332
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,300
And...

333
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,060
So, all the dogs are gone from the dog park.

334
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,080
It's, like, 9 p... I think it's, like, 10 p.m.

335
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,780
or some shit.

336
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,120
And then, um, finally, he pooped.

337
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,100
And then, and he, like, he, like, he was holding onto the ball while pooping.

338
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,260
And then he dropped it.

339
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,700
And then I, obviously, you know, I have to pick it up.

340
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,280
And then I, like, went over to pick up.

341
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,980
And he instantly, like...

342
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,600
Oh, my God.

343
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,300
It's so gross.

344
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,040
He, like, mid-pooped, like...

345
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,860
Like, not unsqu... He was still squatting.

346
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,680
But he, like, shuffled in his squat to, like, pick up the ball.

347
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,420
I'm gonna steal your poop.

348
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,840
Oh, my God.

349
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,340
I'm not gonna steal your ball.

350
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,420
Oh, my... I'm gonna fucking pick up the poop so I can throw it.

351
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
I was like, Dad, please.

352
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,020
I'm not gonna steal your ball.

353
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,900
That is so disgusting.

354
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:56,020
Like, I was just like, oh, my God.

355
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,760
It was still... It was so bad.

356
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,280
I was just like, bro, it's still hanging.

357
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,880
Why did you do that, bro?

358
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,000
I... Oh, my God.

359
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,940
Um... And then after... After, uh...

360
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,420
After... After we were done with, you know, at the dog park, he still didn't let go.

361
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,600
The only time he ever let go of the ball was when we were back in our apartment.

362
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,160
Like, I swear to God, he, like, held onto that ball all the way till we were back to the apartment.

363
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,580
He did not let go.

364
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,240
I was like, Jesus Christ, Dad.

365
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,080
Just like, oh.

366
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,940
And then, I forgot to tell this, but at one point, he, like, walked to the door and was like, I want to go.

367
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:59,300
Like, he tried to demand me to leave because he was like, I don't want anyone to steal this ball.

368
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I want to go home now.

369
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,380
I'm like, come on.

370
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,540
Dad, no.

371
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,360
No, come back.

372
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,560
I have to walk to the door and then, like, body block the door and be like, come on.

373
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,020
Go.

374
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,340
We're not going home.

375
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,100
Come on.

376
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,600
He was so fucking paranoid.

377
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,920
He was like, no, they're going to steal it.

378
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,660
Like, now they stole my ball.

379
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,160
Not so funny.

380
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,800
Now when I have your ball.

381
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,800
I got to put it somewhere safe.

382
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,260
I got to bring it home now.

383
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,020
So, yeah.

384
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:45,980
Now I have an extra ball that I have to, like, bring back every time I go to the dog park in case I see the poodle owner again.

385
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,720
So I can return this stupid fucking ball.

386
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,340
Oh.

387
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,600
He's so goddamn paranoid now.

388
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,320
All right.

389
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,100
Anyway, I hope SoundGuy is here because I forgot to save the sound settings for Halo.

390
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,980
So we're going to have to figure that out together.

391
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,440
Because I remember this game is terribly mixed, right?

392
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,100
It's terribly mixed for audio.

393
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,620
So it's going to be a fun time, SoundGuy.

394
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,360
All right.

395
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,280
Time to boot it up.

396
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:14,580
Anyway.

397
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,080
That is yesterday's dad update.

398
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,760
Today there's another dad update.

399
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
Also, ball related.

400
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,020
You know, I can, you know, fuck, I'll slip it in because this is a fast story.

401
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,520
So today, you know, this time, this time I brought treats with me.

402
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,040
Every day I get a little smarter.

403
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,660
I don't have to fucking deal with this dog.

404
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,100
But today, I also, I also, I brought a ball and treats.

405
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:51,380
So in case he tries to steal another ball, I can bring out the treats so that I can bring out the treats and stuff.

406
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,300
So he could, you know, I'd be like, hey, here's some treats so he could let go of the ball.

407
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,880
So this is a quick dad update for today.

408
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,980
I'll explain more tomorrow or something.

409
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,640
But basically, at one point, we saw another giant Poodle Terrier.

410
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,280
It's literally the same dog breed, but this time he's black instead of brown.

411
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,220
Because then the ball he stole was from a brown dog.

412
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,840
Um, and then this one is, it's the same, it's literally the same breed.

413
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,320
Like, they look the same, except for the colors.

414
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,260
So this time, it's literally the same dog breed.

415
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,680
The giant Poodle Terriers.

416
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,200
Um, they're three times the size of him.

417
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,420
But this time he's black.

418
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Um, but anyway, that, that one also tried to steal his ball.

419
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:49,680
Um, but, um, um, the thing is, um, um, he tries to bring the ball back to, back to the owner.

420
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,940
And then the owner would give me back his ball.

421
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:59,400
And the, but, but like, that dog kept trying to steal his ball.

422
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,080
Uh, well, to be fair, that was the ball he stole.

423
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,880
I literally brought back down, like, the, the ball he stole from the other owner.

424
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,660
Um, just in case I see him again.

425
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,360
Because I didn't want to bring two balls down with me.

426
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,240
Um, anyway.

427
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:20,880
So, uh, at one point, dad got really fucking annoyed by this Poodle Terrier stalking him for the ball.

428
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,500
Uh, yes, I have, I have to.

429
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,420
Because, like, I don't want to bring the two balls down with me.

430
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,220
It's efficient.

431
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,600
Uh, okay, I don't have to.

432
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,800
I'm just lazy.

433
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,720
Anyway.

434
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:39,500
So, he, like, at one point, he got really fucking annoyed at this other Poodle Terrier trying to steal his ball.

435
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,220
That he, like, went to the owner.

436
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,280
And, like, went behind her.

437
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,480
Like, behind her legs.

438
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
And be like, you deal with this.

439
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,540
Train your dog better.

440
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,520
He, like, he, like, held on to the ball and just went to the other owner.

441
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,100
And it's like, you should train him better.

442
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,500
Stop letting him try to steal my ball.

443
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,180
Control him.

444
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,980
Control your dog.

445
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,120
Like, he literally went behind the dog owner.

446
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,980
Like, just like, like, he looked at the dog owner.

447
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,760
He's like, yeah.

448
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,440
Train him better.

449
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,240
Teach him some matters.

450
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:30,240
And then when the other Poototero came over and she was like, scolding him, he like was behind her legs like, yeah, that's right.

451
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,060
He's like, yeah, that's right.

452
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,860
You deserve this.

453
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,020
Think before you try to steal my ball.

454
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,040
I'll go back to your owner again if you do that again.

455
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,580
He's like, do better.

456
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,400
I was just like, Jesus Christ, you're no better.

457
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,200
You are no better, Dad.

458
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,160
Um...

459
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,720
Netverse, thank you for the super chat.

460
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,860
Thank you, thank you.

461
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,080
Angi, let me tell you, Angi I am since my ball was stolen.

462
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,500
There's over 1.1 miles of fuzz on this tennis ball.

463
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:16,020
And if the word Angi was on each micron of fuzz, it wouldn't be how Angi I feel for ball feed.

464
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,000
He's dead, probably.

465
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,240
Thank you for the super chat thing.

466
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,300
Thank you.

467
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,020
Alright.

468
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,500
Time to play some Hello.

469
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:26,960
Okay.

470
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,240
Let me log in real quick.

471
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,620
Okay, we gotta listen to this song because it's iconic.

472
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,840
Ohhhh...

473
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,720
Ohhhh...

474
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,000
Ohhhh...

475
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,080
Ohhhh...

476
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,000
Ohhhh...

477
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,220
Ohhhh...

478
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,700
It's the...

479
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,180
It's the Halo song.

480
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,160
All the...

481
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,300
Me and the boys...

482
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,020
Ohhhh...

483
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,340
Doing the Halo chant.

484
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,360
Ohhhh...

485
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,260
Time to sing it.

486
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,200
Yeah, this is what happens to the men's bathroom.

487
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,460
Um...

488
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,060
Mr. Broken Bond.

489
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,120
Thank you for the super chat.

490
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,940
Thank you, thank you.

491
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,540
Oh my god.

492
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,060
He went to the manager.

493
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,640
He's such a Karen.

494
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,000
Thank you for the super chat.

495
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,080
Thank you, thank you.

496
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:21,980
Alright.

497
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,380
Bum bum.

498
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,420
Alright.

499
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,200
Campaign...

500
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,820
Hey...

501
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,220
Wait, no.

502
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,920
Not Halo Reach.

503
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,660
Alright, resume.

504
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,980
I remember where I'm at.

505
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,240
Oh yeah, we're at a new mission.

506
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,340
Assault in the controller room.

507
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,160
I don't know how many missions I'm gonna do today.

508
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,040
I'm definitely not finishing it today.

509
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,340
But like...

510
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,920
Wait, do I have a pistol?

511
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,960
Oh my god, I do.

512
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,020
Wait, what?

513
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,100
Why am I here?

514
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,740
Why am I like right here?

515
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,360
Where...

516
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,500
Where's my backup?

517
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,080
Like why am I literally...

518
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,540
Why am I like in...

519
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,640
Oh my god!

520
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,020
What?

521
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,620
What is this checkpoint?

522
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,620
I'm literally right here!

523
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,600
What the fuck is this?

524
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,560
Oh my god.

525
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,580
What is this checkpoint?

526
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,720
Why am I like right in the thick of things?

527
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,360
I...

528
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,740
I...

529
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,020
Where are my team?

530
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,060
Oh my god.

531
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:24,120
Oh my god.

532
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,220
Oh my god.

533
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,480
This is bad.

534
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,400
This is bad.

535
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,300
This is bad.

536
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:28,680
Okay.

537
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,580
This is so bad for me.

538
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,200
Oh my god.

539
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,980
Please, please don't hit me.

540
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,960
Just hit zero shots.

541
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,140
Hit zero shots.

542
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,960
I beg of you.

543
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,640
I'm literally one HP.

544
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,400
I...

545
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,500
I...

546
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,330
I...

547
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:43,650
Alright.

548
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,250
It's fine.

549
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,970
Okay.

550
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,190
We're okay now.

551
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,450
Holy shit!

552
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,870
What kind of checkpoint was that?

553
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,770
That was the most bullshit checkpoint ever!

554
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,310
It goes...

555
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,590
There was zero cover!

556
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,110
Alright.

557
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,410
I'm not okay.

558
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,830
I like literally went straight into hell.

559
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:00,950
The...

560
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,650
...

561
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:02,970
Here it is!

562
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,170
Okay, here we go.

563
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,650
Here we go.

564
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,390
Oh, ward ward.

565
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:10,630
No!

566
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,190
Nononononononononon...

567
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,350
Oh...

568
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,030
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me!

569
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:16,770
Okay!

570
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,390
Okay.

571
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:19,790
This is good.

572
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,190
Alright, this is fine.

573
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,030
One HP in a dream.

574
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,150
Okay.

575
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:31,850
No!

576
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,330
No!

577
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,070
Why are you not BMP?

578
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,290
Oh, nice checkpoint.

579
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,430
Alright, it's fine.

580
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,310
Okay.

581
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,050
Alright, it's fine.

582
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,470
It's okay.

583
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,530
I just gotta recharge my shield.

584
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:53,690
It's okay.

585
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,190
I just gotta recharge my shield.

586
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,010
Oh my god.

587
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,630
Oh my god.

588
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,010
A quick track will start appraising messages.

589
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,390
Thank you for the super chat.

590
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,030
Thank you.

591
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,810
Thank you.

592
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,170
Where am I appraised?

593
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,130
Okay.

594
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,650
Okay.

595
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,530
Here we go.

596
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,670
Now I can kill him.

597
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,950
And look at that one guy.

598
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,850
He's like, oh, hey guys.

599
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,450
What's going on?

600
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,690
He's just like, hey, where's Jerry?

601
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,610
Did he die?

602
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:40,770
Alright.

603
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,990
There's one guy to my left.

604
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,690
Oh, please tell me there's heals somewhere.

605
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,050
Oh, hey.

606
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,310
There's a...

607
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,630
Wait.

608
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,350
You're not... Oh, can I just go over there?

609
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,410
There's an ostrich over there.

610
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,570
Oh my god.

611
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,470
Is that...

612
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,730
What are you doing here?

613
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,750
You can't be a hero.

614
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,930
You're just a little grunt.

615
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,030
You're just a little grunt.

616
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,150
You're not a hero.

617
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,670
Get out of here.

618
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,210
Get out of here.

619
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:10,930
Get out of here.

620
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,430
That's right.

621
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,190
You're barely doing any damage.

622
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,150
You're not a lead.

623
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,650
Alright.

624
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,090
It's fine.

625
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,710
What is this?

626
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,610
Jesus Christ.

627
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,730
It's always so bright.

628
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,750
It's so weird seeing how bright it is compared to like...

629
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,150
Uh...

630
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,030
Oh my god.

631
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,590
I swear to god.

632
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,250
Okay.

633
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,190
I swear to god.

634
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:32,450
Okay.

635
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:32,670
Wait.

636
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,250
I got this.

637
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,710
Ugh.

638
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:38,690
Ugh.

639
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,110
Come on!

640
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,310
Come on!

641
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,930
Why are my legs so short, John Halo?

642
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,850
Oh my god.

643
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,410
I am crouch jumping.

644
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,570
I played G-Bod.

645
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,910
I swear...

646
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,010
I swear to god.

647
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,610
I swear to...

648
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,010
Oh my god.

649
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,390
There we go.

650
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,410
There we go.

651
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,010
I swear to god I was crouch jumping.

652
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,250
Alright.

653
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,610
It's just...

654
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,370
Not me!

655
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,390
I... There is no...

656
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,270
You cannot trick me.

657
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,690
There is no such thing as grenade jump.

658
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,690
You can't fucking get me again.

659
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,590
There's like medkits nearby.

660
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:15,890
Oh my god.

661
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:16,690
I need...

662
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,750
I need medkits.

663
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,730
Oh shit.

664
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,310
What the fuck?

665
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,670
What the fuck?

666
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,410
The Covenant presence here is stronger than I anticipated.

667
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,530
They seem to have the entire region secured.

668
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,550
Okay.

669
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,450
I swear to god.

670
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,190
Okay.

671
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,330
Do I have checkpoints?

672
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,530
It's legit.

673
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:39,530
Alright.

674
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,110
I swear to god.

675
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:41,290
Wait.

676
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:41,850
Is there...

677
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,350
Is there any heals here?

678
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,250
Is there...

679
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,470
Is there any...

680
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:45,910
Before...

681
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,830
Before I do it...

682
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,070
Are...

683
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,570
Are there any...

684
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,610
Any heals?

685
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,970
You have no...

686
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,170
That's why I'm asking if there's heals!

687
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,070
I...

688
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,170
I need to make sure you're not...

689
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,890
You're not gaslighting me.

690
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,190
Alright.

691
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:03,850
Here we go.

692
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,330
I don't think they see those.

693
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,110
We're actually going in with one HP and a dream right now.

694
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,050
Hello everybody.

695
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,110
Okay.

696
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:14,690
Wait.

697
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,050
Okay.

698
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:15,130
Okay.

699
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,890
I'm just like wondering if I like...

700
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,870
Rebinded anything.

701
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,550
The weather patterns here seem natural, not artificial.

702
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,350
I wonder if the ring's environment systems are malfunctioning.

703
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,610
Or if the designer...

704
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,210
Oh, okay.

705
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:26,890
It's so cute.

706
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,370
They're sleeping.

707
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,210
Whoops.

708
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,870
Sorry.

709
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,550
He woke up.

710
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,210
Oh shit!

711
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,230
Oh!

712
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:41,770
They...

713
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,010
No!

714
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,470
Fuck!

715
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,590
This is Cortana.

716
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,270
Hold position.

717
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,150
We're on our way.

718
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:45,410
Okay, it's fine.

719
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,010
Roger this.

720
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,690
Make it quick.

721
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,270
It's fine.

722
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:49,850
I have this.

723
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,270
I...

724
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,210
It was...

725
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,610
It was not fine.

726
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,330
It was not fine.

727
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,570
What if the ring's environment systems are malfunctioning?

728
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,490
Or if the designer didn't want to...

729
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,070
It was not fine.

730
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,430
Guys, it was not fine.

731
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,730
It's fine now.

732
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,970
It should be fine now.

733
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:26,730
Please, please.

734
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,130
No!

735
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,850
Okay, this time.

736
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,070
I can self this.

737
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,090
I don't understand.

738
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,670
How did he wake up so fast?

739
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,910
I wonder if the ring's environment systems are malfunctioning.

740
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,910
Like how does he know?

741
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,430
Oh, that's how he knows.

742
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,150
It's okay.

743
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,370
He can't know a second time.

744
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,250
It's okay.

745
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,880
I got this.

746
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,620
And I'm gonna do something like this.

747
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,480
And I'll be like...

748
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,060
And then I'm gonna run to this one.

749
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,860
And then I'm gonna shoot him from here.

750
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,220
Ha ha ha ha!

751
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,680
Stupid!

752
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,700
He hit a wall!

753
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,320
That's fucking right.

754
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,220
And then...

755
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,680
And then I'm gonna...

756
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,080
And then I'm gonna...

757
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,300
No!

758
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,280
I took too long!

759
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,660
I...

760
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,820
I took too long to get out!

761
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,780
With a pistol!

762
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,860
But it's such a tiny gun!

763
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,440
Wait.

764
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,040
Oh, there's less people now.

765
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,160
I wonder if the ring's environment systems are malfunctioning.

766
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,880
I think the game feels sorry for me.

767
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,980
Why is there less people?

768
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,780
What is there?

769
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,400
Oh, no.

770
00:34:59,560 --> 00:34:59,800
He...

771
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,140
Wait.

772
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,460
What?

773
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,580
No!

774
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,340
What?

775
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,320
They just woke up and I got confused!

776
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,430
They just woke up and I got confused!

777
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,350
Okay.

778
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:08,970
Okay.

779
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:09,550
Okay.

780
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:09,970
This is fine.

781
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,550
Alright, here we go.

782
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,270
Are you serious?

783
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,090
Oh my god.

784
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,530
Get out!

785
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,390
Get out of here!

786
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,210
This is fucked up.

787
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,250
This is fucked up.

788
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,630
What hit me?!

789
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,370
Oh my god!

790
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,230
Oh!

791
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,970
I'm stuck in a fucking loop!

792
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,710
You're seeing natural, not artificial.

793
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,250
I wonder if the ring's environment systems are malfunctioning.

794
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,710
Oh my god!

795
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:51,210
Stop!

796
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,930
Okay, here we go.

797
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,230
What the fuck you were sleeping?!

798
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,170
Who got onto this one?!

799
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,770
Jesus Christ!

800
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,930
Oh my god!

801
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,350
Get out of here!

802
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:05,370
There!

803
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,110
You fucker.

804
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,010
You fucker.

805
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:10,530
I...

806
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,450
You fucker.

807
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,150
Okay.

808
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,410
Okay, here we go.

809
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,610
Alright, here we go.

810
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,530
Don't worry, I got covered.

811
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,830
Get out of here!

812
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,810
Oh my god, it's burning.

813
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:26,910
There we go.

814
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,310
Okay.

815
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,150
The pistol was all I need.

816
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,590
Alright, now I can use this for real.

817
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:33,690
There we go.

818
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,370
Okay, now I can't.

819
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,530
He's like blocking it.

820
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,650
Alright, there we go.

821
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,630
I'm not running.

822
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,410
We don't run here.

823
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,070
We gotta make sure they're all dead.

824
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,150
We gotta get rid of all the aliens.

825
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,570
What the fuck?

826
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,070
What's shot me?

827
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,310
Oh my god, he's down here.

828
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,330
Oh, he's shooting me from below.

829
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,590
Okay.

830
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:03,930
It's fine.

831
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,170
Wait, it's not fine?

832
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,570
Where is he?

833
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,870
Where the fuck is he?

834
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,950
Okay, I gotta really...

835
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,290
Alright.

836
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,470
Give me your gun.

837
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,210
No, not this gun!

838
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,390
Okay.

839
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,370
Oh my god, they're all the needlers.

840
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,290
Oh my god, I hate this.

841
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,970
I'm so far away.

842
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,290
Okay, I need this gun.

843
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,070
I gotta make sure I don't die from this guy from below me.

844
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,350
From underground.

845
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,090
You still have shields?

846
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,430
Yeah, you do.

847
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,010
Yeah, you fucking do.

848
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,610
Little bitch.

849
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:39,750
Shit.

850
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,610
That's fucking right.

851
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,110
I'm pretty sure I got all the shields out.

852
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,810
Alright, get over here.

853
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,310
Come on.

854
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,770
Where are you?

855
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,910
Oh shit!

856
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:52,290
Oh!

857
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:52,930
Oh my god!

858
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,510
Okay, I almost thought I was gonna fall down.

859
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,490
Wait, where did he go?

860
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,410
He disappeared.

861
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,310
He actually disappeared.

862
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,870
Where did he go?

863
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,210
Did I kill him?

864
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,350
He just fell off?

865
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,930
Oh, that sucks.

866
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,470
I thought he had like two more years in him.

867
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,750
Oh my god.

868
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,050
OH SHIT!

869
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,770
Okay, it's fine.

870
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,350
Oh my god, it's not fine.

871
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,030
Oh my god, it's not fine.

872
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,610
I have to be so careful because of how low HP I am.

873
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,950
That sucks, buddy.

874
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,090
Falling off like that.

875
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,450
Oh, I don't have a lot of pistol ammo left.

876
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,410
It's fine.

877
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,070
It's fine.

878
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:42,570
Hello?

879
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,850
God damn it.

880
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,610
I got distracted by this guy.

881
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,750
Okay, I need to make sure every ammo counts.

882
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,530
Oh my god, he reminds me of Tiny Chef.

883
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:58,910
Wait!

884
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,570
He sounds just like Tiny Chef!

885
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,110
Are you serious?

886
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,410
I said I need to make sure every bullet counts.

887
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,350
And I missed?

888
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,470
Okay, there we go.

889
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,170
He won a blimmy.

890
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:19,930
WOOOOO!

891
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,440
No!

892
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,240
No no no no no no no no no!

893
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,280
No no no no no no no no!

894
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,280
Oh, okay...

895
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,100
I think we're okay.

896
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:34,860
I...

897
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,480
I don't have much to give.

898
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,460
I don't have much to...

899
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,360
Oh, he's dead!

900
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,620
Oh my god, he's dead.

901
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,060
Okay.

902
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,640
I didn't think he would die that fast.

903
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,320
Thank God.

904
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,860
Oh, thank God.

905
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,540
Oh, thank God.

906
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,940
I was gonna send that over there.

907
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,100
Yeah, I cannot be.

908
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,580
I do not trust myself to go forward.

909
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,640
Cuz I don't need the kneeler.

910
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,740
Look at that, I survived.

911
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,900
Look at that.

912
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,060
One hit, one kill.

913
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,060
Oh, yes, the checkpoint when I'm one HP.

914
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,620
I love it.

915
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,900
You think he knows?

916
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,640
Guys, I don't think he knows.

917
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,160
Oh, no.

918
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,280
Oh, no.

919
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,860
Oh, no.

920
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,360
Oh, no.

921
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,060
Where is he?

922
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,100
Oh, yeah, nice.

923
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,500
Headshot.

924
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,060
Okay, nice.

925
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,900
We got a better gun.

926
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,540
Okay, we got a better gun, guys.

927
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,980
We're okay now.

928
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,060
We're okay.

929
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,640
Everything is okay.

930
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,400
Calculated, guys.

931
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,620
Very calculated.

932
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,160
Also, sound guy.

933
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,000
Oh, nice.

934
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,260
Heal.

935
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:10,940
Heals.

936
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,720
Oh, I can be less scared now.

937
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,580
JK, I'm always scared.

938
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,440
I'm always paranoid.

939
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,340
I hear him.

940
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,180
But how's the sound so far, sound guy?

941
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,170
Where are they?

942
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,250
Oh, there he is.

943
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,990
I was like, where is this real guy?

944
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,710
I see him.

945
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,210
Oh.

946
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,010
No.

947
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,010
It's okay.

948
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,150
I'm ready with the backshots.

949
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,110
I've been practicing in Elden Ring.

950
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,690
I told you.

951
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,570
Every game there's backshots.

952
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,450
I'm becoming a master backshotter.

953
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,350
Look at that.

954
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,410
I'm a professional now.

955
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,190
There we go.

956
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,290
That's right.

957
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,630
It's lethal.

958
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:10,450
Oh.

959
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,650
Somebody stop it!

960
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,090
Oh, we're safe.

961
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,070
Mirage will take us out.

962
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:20,130
Things are fine, but the game is right under your level and big fights.

963
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:20,470
Okay.

964
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:21,970
That's good.

965
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,670
I don't know if that's good, actually.

966
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,930
Alright, here I go.

967
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,910
That's right.

968
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,610
And they don't stop coming.

969
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,970
They heard the rumors.

970
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,650
They're like, there's no way.

971
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,050
Alright.

972
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,090
Ooh.

973
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,590
This is a long ass elevator.

974
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,030
Oh my god.

975
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,010
What a waste of...

976
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,410
Space.

977
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,710
Okay.

978
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,270
It was worth it.

979
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:18,750
Poink.

980
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,790
It was all a very bad dream, guys.

981
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,630
It was all...

982
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,330
It was all a very bad dream.

983
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:29,090
Wow.

984
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,690
It's like it never...

985
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:31,830
Never happened.

986
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,810
Oh, he has shields.

987
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,370
Oh, that's bad.

988
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:38,450
Oh my god.

989
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,200
Alright, that's fine.

990
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,320
I wanted to kill them all anyway.

991
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:49,980
Oh wait.

992
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,060
I need...

993
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:51,700
This one.

994
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,320
I'm running out of ammo.

995
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,440
Alright, where is he?

996
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,740
There we go.

997
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,940
It just wasn't worth it.

998
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,560
I don't...

999
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,920
I don't think I should waste my ammo for these guys.

1000
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,420
Do I go down here?

1001
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,240
Aw.

1002
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,100
Wait.

1003
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,360
That bulletproof glass?

1004
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,660
When did they invent bulletproof glass?

1005
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:17,900
Alright.

1006
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,460
I guess we go that way.

1007
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,240
Yeah.

1008
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,460
Go this way.

1009
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,540
Oh.

1010
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,860
There's something over here.

1011
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,840
Aw.

1012
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:26,920
Aw.

1013
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,140
I wanted to shoot through that glass.

1014
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,220
We have to go this way anyway.

1015
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:37,840
Okay.

1016
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:38,540
Oops.

1017
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,520
Why is it sometimes...

1018
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,360
Is it because I get hit?

1019
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,140
If I get hit, like...

1020
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:45,400
Oh!

1021
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,800
Oh my god.

1022
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,340
Oh my god.

1023
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,220
Please, please, please, please.

1024
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,900
I do not want to lose heals here.

1025
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,180
Okay, that's fine.

1026
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,560
That's fine.

1027
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:56,960
Alright.

1028
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:57,400
Alright.

1029
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:57,440
Oh!

1030
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,300
When I get hit, it, like, de-scopes.

1031
00:44:59,500 --> 00:44:59,680
Okay.

1032
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,100
I was gonna say, like...

1033
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,160
Why does it unscope myself?

1034
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,840
Is he sleeping?

1035
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,100
Oh, they're sleeping forever.

1036
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,220
Technically, they are sleeping.

1037
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,060
It's just...

1038
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:12,960
Maybe it's...

1039
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,860
I sleep forever.

1040
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,580
I'm on hard difficulty.

1041
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,920
And it's not that hard.

1042
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:21,940
Oh!

1043
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,640
Over here?

1044
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:29,090
Uh...

1045
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:29,810
I guess over here.

1046
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,890
Did I come from here?

1047
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,010
No.

1048
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,350
The arrows are pointing away.

1049
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:37,970
Right?

1050
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:38,810
Yeah.

1051
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:39,870
The arrows are pointing...

1052
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,210
Oh yeah!

1053
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:40,730
I'm outside!

1054
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:41,490
Oh my god!

1055
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:41,990
I'm outside!

1056
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:44,690
Okay.

1057
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:45,470
That's awkward.

1058
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:49,810
Oh, hey!

1059
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:50,590
They're my people!

1060
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:52,610
Okay.

1061
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,750
I'm just gonna use this.

1062
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,350
It doesn't look like yours fall off.

1063
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:55,850
For this.

1064
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,090
Yeah.

1065
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:57,570
What?!

1066
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,210
What shot me?!

1067
00:45:59,210 --> 00:45:59,490
Oh!

1068
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:00,850
These guys.

1069
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,350
Can I destroy that?

1070
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,570
Is that possible?

1071
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,280
Can I destroy that or no?

1072
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,780
I can't tell.

1073
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:12,940
Yeah?

1074
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,060
Okay.

1075
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,640
I'm just gonna shimmy a little.

1076
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,260
I'm okay, though.

1077
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,720
I think my...

1078
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,300
I think my...

1079
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,000
I think the army's dead.

1080
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,980
No, they're still alive.

1081
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,260
Okay.

1082
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,200
Maybe I should save them.

1083
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,180
I'm gonna go over and save them real quick.

1084
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:32,900
Uh-oh.

1085
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,520
I think that's a good idea.

1086
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,140
There we go.

1087
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,040
Don't worry, guys.

1088
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,080
I'm a hero!

1089
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,500
Don't fight this thing alone!

1090
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:47,880
Oh.

1091
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,360
What?!

1092
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,120
What?!

1093
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,780
I...

1094
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,720
Oh, yeah.

1095
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,740
I need tissues right now.

1096
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,380
I ran up.

1097
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,720
I ran up tissues.

1098
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,640
I'm freaking sick.

1099
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,130
I don't know how the fuck I died there.

1100
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,330
Like, I literally...

1101
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,350
I just exploded!

1102
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,290
What killed me?!

1103
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,330
I got hit in the back by a car?!

1104
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,530
Did anyone get their license plate?!

1105
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:38,310
Oh, that's...

1106
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:38,750
Yeah, I...

1107
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:39,910
I hear the gunshots.

1108
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:40,830
Oh, that's awkward.

1109
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:45,490
That's...

1110
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,050
That's...

1111
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:46,650
Ooh...

1112
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,730
I hear...

1113
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:48,670
Ooh, that's awkward.

1114
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:51,450
Whoa...

1115
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,330
Whoopsie!

1116
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,300
Okay, this is a...

1117
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:57,800
Oops...

1118
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,500
This is a waste.

1119
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,020
Can I lead this?

1120
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:01,920
No.

1121
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:02,880
Wait, I can't.

1122
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:03,920
God damn it.

1123
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,780
I thought I could lead it.

1124
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,540
Wait, there's a goat?

1125
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,700
There's a goat somewhere?

1126
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,700
Bro, it's so hard to see where's the ghosts.

1127
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,620
Cause they're all...

1128
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,940
We're like in the snow.

1129
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,400
How the fuck am I supposed to know where they are?

1130
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,850
Okay, maybe I can...

1131
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:30,410
Oh, it would be so awkward if I actually put the marine there.

1132
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,930
That would be so awkward.

1133
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,410
Oh my god, I can't lead my fucking shot for the life of me.

1134
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:40,810
There you go.

1135
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,030
There we go.

1136
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,590
He's dead.

1137
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,120
Oh, it's a vehicle!

1138
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:50,560
Oh!

1139
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,740
I thought you meant like an actual...

1140
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,440
Like, the invisible guys are called ghosts.

1141
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,080
I thought that's what you meant.

1142
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,200
Alright.

1143
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,860
These guys I'm gonna use.

1144
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,380
Use this.

1145
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,020
Just cause I can't lead my shots here.

1146
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,040
Oh no.

1147
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,120
There you go.

1148
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,800
My hand hurt.

1149
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,440
Okay, there you go.

1150
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:19,900
Nice.

1151
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,200
Oh my god, marine...

1152
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,260
Marines are still alive!

1153
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,300
Good for them.

1154
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,340
Oh my god, there's still so many.

1155
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:28,900
What are you guys doing?

1156
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,040
Okay, I'm gonna put this over here for these guys.

1157
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,780
I hope that this hits him.

1158
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:38,110
Alright.

1159
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,550
I see you!

1160
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,130
I see you!

1161
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:48,870
Oh shit!

1162
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:49,530
Wait, that hit me!

1163
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,770
Boy, I didn't see you.

1164
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,430
Hello?

1165
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:54,490
Is he dead?

1166
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:55,810
I think he's dead.

1167
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,730
Alright, we can go back.

1168
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,630
Don't worry, you're alive.

1169
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,030
Oh, wait.

1170
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,090
Don't worry, you're...

1171
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,370
Okay, thank god.

1172
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:03,230
Thank god.

1173
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:05,770
Thank god.

1174
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:06,770
Okay, you're alive.

1175
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,290
It's alright.

1176
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:08,930
Oh, wait!

1177
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,750
Oh, thank god all of you died!

1178
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,190
Now I have a new gun!

1179
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:15,390
Nice.

1180
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:17,990
Oh, but there's only like 22 bullets.

1181
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,490
Okay, wait.

1182
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:19,830
Is that this?

1183
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:21,330
Or...

1184
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:22,830
Okay, how many bullets?

1185
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,850
Uh, I'll go with a sniper.

1186
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,010
A sniper's better.

1187
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,090
Okay, that's good.

1188
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,010
Since all of you guys are dead, I get to steal all your ammo.

1189
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:33,650
Anybody here?

1190
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,010
Oh, there is.

1191
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:37,850
You know what?

1192
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:38,610
It's alright.

1193
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,050
I figured this out.

1194
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,350
Alright.

1195
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,890
Give me a sec.

1196
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,010
Let me, uh...

1197
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,280
It's so worth it.

1198
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,100
They serve their purpose in life.

1199
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,260
Oh, shit!

1200
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:12,730
They're...

1201
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,390
All your friends are dead.

1202
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,910
I don't know what you're talking about.

1203
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,490
You can't hide from me!

1204
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:21,410
The baddest...

1205
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:21,710
Badass...

1206
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,430
Most badass squad in the marines.

1207
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:25,570
There's...

1208
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,170
You're the only survivor.

1209
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:27,690
You're...

1210
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,230
Uh...

1211
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,370
You're literally the only survivor.

1212
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:32,890
I don't know if I should...

1213
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,390
Guys, should I keep the...

1214
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:34,870
Tank?

1215
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:35,670
Uh, sorry.

1216
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:36,450
The rocket launcher?

1217
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,670
Or the sniper, guys?

1218
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:38,770
I don't know.

1219
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:40,910
Oh, my chat died.

1220
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:41,270
Whoops.

1221
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:42,910
Let me reload this.

1222
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:45,970
Keep the sniper?

1223
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:46,530
Okay.

1224
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:48,630
Alright.

1225
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:49,910
Let me...

1226
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,030
Where is...

1227
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,270
Alright.

1228
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:53,410
Whoa!

1229
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,130
Wait, did I?

1230
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,010
Goddammit.

1231
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:55,330
Okay.

1232
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,290
Here we go.

1233
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,950
I wanna make sure I got the sniper before I...

1234
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:01,610
Alright.

1235
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,430
Let's go.

1236
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,650
Yeah, but the pistol's better, though.

1237
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,070
Isn't the pistol better?

1238
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:11,390
Come on!

1239
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:11,990
Floor it!

1240
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:16,190
Alright.

1241
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:17,550
Whee!

1242
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,060
Wait.

1243
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,500
Aww.

1244
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:23,880
It's broken.

1245
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,300
I can't use it anymore.

1246
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,460
Textures are glitching.

1247
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,560
Don't worry, I can fix this.

1248
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:31,740
Whee!

1249
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:34,740
Alright.

1250
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,580
Here we go.

1251
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,000
Is he almost dead?

1252
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,120
Oh, shit.

1253
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,700
Come on, you kill him.

1254
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,000
You got this, buddy.

1255
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,180
I believe in you.

1256
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,560
There you go.

1257
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:45,960
I helped.

1258
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,680
No witnesses.

1259
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,380
Oh, shit.

1260
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,740
No witnesses.

1261
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,220
Oh,

1262
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,100
shit.

1263
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,240
Bro, buddy.

1264
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,040
Don't be a hero.

1265
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,920
Get back in here.

1266
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,560
Get back in here.

1267
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,480
Don't be a hero.

1268
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,560
Oh, hey.

1269
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,720
Oh, we got another buddy.

1270
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,600
Oh, my God.

1271
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,100
Sergeant!

1272
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,920
Sergeant, you're alive?!

1273
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,460
Oh, my God.

1274
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,320
You're alive!

1275
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,580
Oh, my God.

1276
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,780
Is that tank?!

1277
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,960
Sergeant Johnson!

1278
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:32,620
Shit.

1279
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:32,920
Okay.

1280
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,600
We gotta grab this.

1281
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,420
Let's go.

1282
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:40,900
That's right.

1283
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,220
There's another one.

1284
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,060
Wait.

1285
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:44,760
Okay.

1286
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,020
I was gonna say, where's my ammo?

1287
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,020
Get over here.

1288
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,680
Get your ass over here.

1289
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,720
Sergeant Johnson!

1290
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,400
Get on!

1291
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,840
Get on!

1292
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,420
Oh, wait.

1293
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,100
Did I kill him?

1294
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,040
Wait.

1295
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,230
What happened to the guy that was...

1296
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,540
Ooh.

1297
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,550
It's okay.

1298
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:12,270
I had to kill him for Johnson, guys.

1299
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:17,950
Guys, you don't understand.

1300
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:21,410
He had to die so Johnson can...

1301
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,950
So Johnson can sit on the tank.

1302
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:24,030
Okay.

1303
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,170
Guys, it had to...

1304
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:27,930
Sacrifice had to be made.

1305
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:30,670
Nice.

1306
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,090
Okay.

1307
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:32,930
Oh!

1308
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:34,650
I had him another gun.

1309
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:35,050
Okay.

1310
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:36,270
That's actually convenient.

1311
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,830
What do you mean almost a man?!

1312
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,490
Say that again, Johnson!

1313
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,090
To my face!

1314
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,550
Do you know what happened to the other Marine that used to be here?

1315
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:57,030
You don't want it to happen to you, Mr. Johnson.

1316
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,150
There we go.

1317
00:54:59,630 --> 00:54:59,970
Nice.

1318
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:03,070
You know there used to be two Marines here.

1319
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,030
Oh, shit.

1320
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:10,810
Oh, shit.

1321
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:12,390
My shield.

1322
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:13,550
Alright.

1323
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:14,250
Haha.

1324
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,150
Where's your shield, bitch?

1325
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,790
Oh my god.

1326
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,830
What the fuck is this spread, though?

1327
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:21,330
Haha.

1328
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,350
What is this?

1329
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:24,790
He takes spread.

1330
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:26,950
It's okay.

1331
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:29,030
Sergeant Johnson's okay, guys.

1332
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:30,770
Goddammit.

1333
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:31,530
Haha.

1334
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,450
The fucking clip.

1335
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,050
Okay, we got him.

1336
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,230
It's fine.

1337
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,510
Yeah, they're actual dead dead.

1338
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,430
To that one guy.

1339
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,310
There was never a one guy.

1340
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:48,810
They're all dead, right?

1341
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:50,450
I'll make sure you destroy that.

1342
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:50,730
Haha.

1343
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:51,070
Okay.

1344
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,490
You thought you could hide behind that?

1345
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,250
Alright, let's go.

1346
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:57,570
We're fine.

1347
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:58,230
Whoops.

1348
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:00,750
See?

1349
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,410
We're fine.

1350
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,410
Do I flip, Mr. Johnson?

1351
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:08,430
Can I run him over?

1352
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,460
Nice.

1353
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,380
More ammo.

1354
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,100
Holy shit!

1355
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,480
He can't...

1356
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,340
OOOOOH!

1357
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:54,420
No!

1358
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,600
What the fuck?

1359
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,620
The hunkies were just a distraction?

1360
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:10,200
Oh my god, if only... Guys, if only I had someone with a sniper ammo right now.

1361
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,940
If only I had someone with a sniper rifle to help me.

1362
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,680
Why did they send me alone for this mission?

1363
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,660
Why was I sent alone?

1364
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:24,660
Yes!

1365
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,000
If only there were more people here!

1366
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,160
Yes!

1367
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,500
Oh, he's still alive.

1368
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,300
Is he dead yet?

1369
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,540
Oh yeah, he's definitely dead.

1370
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,360
Alright, I want...

1371
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,680
If only I wasn't sent into a one-man mission and had more people...

1372
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,240
Oh, whatever, I'm just going to go down here.

1373
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,660
Forget about that tank.

1374
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,260
Who cares about that tank?

1375
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,400
Alright.

1376
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:03,470
Wait, this was a dead end?

1377
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,210
What the fuck?

1378
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,790
Where did these hunters come from if it was a dead end?

1379
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:13,670
Where do I go?

1380
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,510
Oh, there's a button to open the door?

1381
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,350
Alright, let's go back down.

1382
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:24,810
I see no button.

1383
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:25,590
Oh, there it is.

1384
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:26,430
Oh, there it is.

1385
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:28,870
Such a tiny button.

1386
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:30,890
Alright.

1387
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,610
I'd like a...

1388
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:36,250
I would like a mango smoothie, please.

1389
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:37,650
With some chicken nuggets.

1390
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,070
Alright.

1391
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:43,530
Down, I'll go.

1392
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,070
What are they going to do?

1393
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,290
Destroy my tank?

1394
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:47,810
Ha!

1395
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,610
That's fucking right.

1396
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:52,550
That's right.

1397
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,510
We can't do anything against this fucker.

1398
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:57,750
I have unlimited ammo.

1399
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:00,950
That's fucking right.

1400
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:01,870
I'm unstoppable.

1401
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,330
That's right.

1402
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,570
I see you guys over there.

1403
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:07,710
Oh, you think you're so safe.

1404
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:08,010
Oh!

1405
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:09,750
Oh my god.

1406
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:10,590
The ricochet.

1407
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:11,490
What the fuck?

1408
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:12,210
He still lives?

1409
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:13,550
Okay.

1410
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:16,150
This one minion is dodging every single bullet.

1411
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,510
This is actually pretty sad.

1412
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,310
This is pretty sad.

1413
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:20,730
I can't...

1414
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,170
I have unlimited power!

1415
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,730
Okay, get out of here.

1416
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:27,770
That's right.

1417
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:28,910
Get closer!

1418
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,330
So my bullets can actually hit you!

1419
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:33,090
That's right.

1420
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:33,910
I'm getting closer.

1421
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:37,610
If you won't get closer, I'd get closer.

1422
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:39,750
That's right.

1423
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,010
Oh shit, wait.

1424
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:43,010
You're actually hitting me.

1425
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,030
Don't worry.

1426
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:46,690
I'm getting closer.

1427
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:49,990
What the fuck?

1428
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,610
Okay, I got...

1429
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:00,250
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

1430
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:00,650
Thank you.

1431
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:00,990
Okay.

1432
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:02,770
I got walled.

1433
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:07,390
Guys, I shot a wall accidentally.

1434
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:10,770
I deserve that.

1435
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,950
I may or may not have shot a wall.

1436
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:17,550
It's okay.

1437
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,130
It's okay.

1438
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:20,070
I learned my lesson.

1439
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:21,870
No more walls for me.

1440
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,650
Oh man, I have to shoot...

1441
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:25,270
Are you serious?

1442
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:26,430
Get out of here.

1443
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,570
Let me figure out where these guys are.

1444
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:30,770
Okay.

1445
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,850
Fuck that one guy in particular though.

1446
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,090
I know you're over here.

1447
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:37,210
Come on.

1448
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,410
I know you're right over there.

1449
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:40,970
Get out of here.

1450
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,050
Who put that wall in?

1451
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,090
Who built that wall here just now?

1452
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,470
Who did that?

1453
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,130
Oh my god.

1454
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,030
Get out of here.

1455
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,270
There used to be no wall.

1456
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:57,250
All right.

1457
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:58,550
We slowly head up.

1458
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:00,650
There we go.

1459
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,030
We slowly head up.

1460
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,010
Oh shit.

1461
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:06,910
I was gonna say, can my tank like accidentally fall?

1462
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:10,250
Would that be fucking hilarious?

1463
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:12,290
From the weight of the tank?

1464
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:13,570
Oh my god.

1465
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:13,750
Oh my god.

1466
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:14,550
It's still alive.

1467
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:16,830
Oh my god.

1468
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,910
I think it's still alive.

1469
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:19,810
Holy shit.

1470
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:20,110
Okay.

1471
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,110
It was still alive.

1472
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:22,970
Okay.

1473
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:23,310
It's fine.

1474
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,390
I can shoot it from here.

1475
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:25,690
Bye.

1476
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:27,510
Okay.

1477
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,950
That should be where it hits, right?

1478
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,850
Right here.

1479
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:32,610
Okay.

1480
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:32,790
No.

1481
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:33,550
There's a wall here.

1482
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:34,490
All right, guys.

1483
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,650
I need you to get closer.

1484
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:38,070
Guys, please.

1485
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,630
I have a wall here.

1486
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:41,350
I can't...

1487
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:42,570
I can't get to you.

1488
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:45,590
Okay.

1489
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:45,890
Nice.

1490
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:46,430
There we go.

1491
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:47,270
Woo.

1492
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:49,430
Goodbye, Hunter.

1493
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:53,070
Slowly and steady.

1494
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:55,190
There we go.

1495
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:56,770
Wait.

1496
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:58,290
There's so much damage to me.

1497
01:01:58,350 --> 01:01:58,570
Why?

1498
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,070
I don't like that.

1499
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:02,390
Not my...

1500
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,270
Exactly, Willy.

1501
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:04,370
Thank you for the super chat.

1502
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:04,770
Thank you.

1503
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:05,310
Thank you.

1504
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,270
Not my fault someone put a wall there.

1505
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:09,810
Wait, what?

1506
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:12,750
Where'd you get over here?

1507
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:14,690
Okay.

1508
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:14,970
Nice.

1509
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:15,530
Get closer.

1510
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:16,030
Yes.

1511
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:16,810
Get closer.

1512
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:17,810
Yes.

1513
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:22,750
That's right.

1514
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:25,050
Get closer.

1515
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:26,390
So it can be more efficient.

1516
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,950
I know you're here.

1517
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:30,910
What?

1518
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:31,210
What?

1519
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:31,530
What?

1520
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,970
Oh, you think that's gonna save you?

1521
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,590
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1522
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,190
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1523
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,210
That's fucking right.

1524
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,710
Oh, you got blood on my tire track.

1525
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,130
All right.

1526
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:47,390
We go this way now.

1527
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,610
Wee.

1528
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:52,970
Okay, there should be a blood in here.

1529
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,190
What do you mean, where are the Marines?

1530
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:58,330
They sent me on a one-man mission.

1531
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,690
I'm all the Marines they got.

1532
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,500
All right.

1533
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,360
All right.

1534
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,440
Down the road I go.

1535
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,540
Wee.

1536
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:16,310
Rolling thunder?

1537
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,350
Why am I in the middle of a cutscene?

1538
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,870
You think these rocks are gonna... Oh my god.

1539
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:31,350
Okay, wait.

1540
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:32,110
Give me a sec.

1541
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:33,910
You think these... Oh my god.

1542
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:34,450
Give me a sec.

1543
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:35,990
Let me... Okay.

1544
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:40,210
Apparently these rocks are gonna... Are gonna stop me.

1545
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:43,050
You think these rocks are gonna stop me?

1546
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:44,850
That's fucking right.

1547
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:46,510
Get over it.

1548
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,670
They will.

1549
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,190
So yeah.

1550
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,570
I can drive around them.

1551
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:57,110
The nature's not gonna stop me.

1552
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,430
Can I destroy this?

1553
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,510
Oh shit.

1554
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:05,930
Okay.

1555
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:06,670
That's fine.

1556
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:08,290
Just literally back up.

1557
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:10,090
That's fine.

1558
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:13,130
Surely this car... Yeah.

1559
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:20,370
Sure this guy's gonna be too stupid and drive into me, right?

1560
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,490
That's most likely gonna happen.

1561
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:25,790
Alright.

1562
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,250
Get over here.

1563
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:30,670
What the fuck are you doing?

1564
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:32,870
Oh, that's just sad.

1565
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:33,650
Guys.

1566
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,530
That's fucking sad.

1567
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:36,350
Little buddies.

1568
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:37,990
Get over here.

1569
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:42,890
This is sad.

1570
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:44,150
Get out of here.

1571
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:46,870
Get out of here.

1572
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:47,850
This is too sad.

1573
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:49,730
Get out.

1574
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,310
That's right.

1575
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,790
Can't stop me.

1576
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:56,250
Can't stop me.

1577
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,110
That's fucking right.

1578
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:02,090
What do I do with a ghost when I have a fucking tank.

1579
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:03,170
You know what?

1580
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,870
I don't need this shit.

1581
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,890
Get this out of here.

1582
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:15,150
Get that junk out of here.

1583
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,470
Okay, we gotta get rid of that just in case.

1584
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:17,550
Nice.

1585
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:20,670
Oh, free heals.

1586
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:23,870
Okay, I knew there was some guy over there waiting.

1587
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,150
I'll make sure he's out of here.

1588
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:27,150
Oh, what the fuck?

1589
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:30,610
Yeah.

1590
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:31,590
Oh, what?

1591
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:34,610
What sniped me?

1592
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,170
Wait, something sniped me.

1593
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:40,350
What?

1594
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,050
I got stickied?

1595
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,730
Wait, how's there two now?

1596
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:51,250
That's a thing?

1597
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:53,770
Oh my god, bro.

1598
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:56,170
That guy... He is very confident.

1599
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,350
But I'm inside the tank.

1600
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:03,930
How did he stickied me?

1601
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:07,810
What the fuck?

1602
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,050
How did he get inside?

1603
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,990
Did he, like, death-starred it?

1604
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,830
He fucking... It was Luke Skywalker.

1605
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:18,190
He death-starred my tank.

1606
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,010
That's... Oh my god, he did it again.

1607
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:22,890
He did it again.

1608
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:31,010
That crush deserves a metal.

1609
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:33,590
He actually did it again.

1610
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:37,830
Someone close the cover on my tank.

1611
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:38,630
Please.

1612
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,090
Wait, did no one get in the car?

1613
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,270
Like, what was that?

1614
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:51,550
Okay, now I know.

1615
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:54,110
I'll never do that again.

1616
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,210
Never get close to them.

1617
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,070
Never open your heart.

1618
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:04,970
Don't show compassion.

1619
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,320
Jesus Christ.

1620
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,660
Okay, I knew that rock was gonna kill me.

1621
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,360
I fucking knew it.

1622
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,660
I'm putting my distance in them now.

1623
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,080
That's right.

1624
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:22,960
That's right.

1625
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,680
You can't get close to me now.

1626
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,020
That's fucking right.

1627
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:28,620
Oh!

1628
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:38,870
Holy shit.

1629
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,310
Holy shit.

1630
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:42,990
That guy deserved it.

1631
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,110
That guy deserved it.

1632
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,090
Oh my god.

1633
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,370
Get him out of here.

1634
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,950
I don't know how I live.

1635
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:56,290
Oh my god, I live.

1636
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:57,870
That's crazy.

1637
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:58,790
I should not live.

1638
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,570
I need to get rid of these.

1639
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:06,570
I don't trust.

1640
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:09,330
Oh my god, that tree tanked entire fucking shot.

1641
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:13,230
Okay, there has to be a health kit right there.

1642
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,090
In that pile of bodies.

1643
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:20,270
There has to be a health kit right there.

1644
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:24,850
What do I preemptively fire?

1645
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:26,930
God, I want to grab that health kit.

1646
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,730
God, I want to grab it so...

1647
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:29,610
Okay.

1648
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:32,410
Okay, I preemptively shot that hole.

1649
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:33,570
That's fucking right.

1650
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:35,390
That's right.

1651
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:38,290
Open that door again.

1652
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:42,750
That's where I'm looking at you.

1653
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,150
Open it again.

1654
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,230
Okay, I can grab my health pack.

1655
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:49,330
Okay, nice.

1656
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:53,050
Oh, and there's a rocket launcher too.

1657
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,170
Oh, no.

1658
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,150
I'll keep this for now.

1659
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:59,690
Why get a rocket launcher when I literally have a fucking tank?

1660
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:01,930
All right.

1661
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:03,530
Do, do, do.

1662
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:05,030
Back to driving.

1663
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:06,350
Is there anybody in that?

1664
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:07,030
Oh, there is.

1665
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:07,390
Whoops.

1666
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:09,310
He's like, oh my god, what the fuck was that?

1667
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:14,510
He's like, you guys saw that?

1668
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:15,670
What was that?

1669
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:20,430
Did I almost die there?

1670
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:21,650
Oh my god, ew.

1671
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:23,970
All right.

1672
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:26,510
Oh, shit.

1673
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,110
Is that getting...

1674
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:30,390
Oh, shit!

1675
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:33,090
What the fuck?

1676
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:35,810
That was a distraction?

1677
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,470
A fucking...

1678
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,230
The hunter distraction.

1679
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,130
It's like...

1680
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:44,410
John, I'm gonna do it for you.

1681
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:45,150
Okay?

1682
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:46,770
Take the shot, John.

1683
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:48,270
You gotta take the shot.

1684
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:54,830
This is our one and only chance.

1685
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:00,390
Oh my god, my health pack.

1686
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,950
My precious health pack.

1687
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:03,530
God.

1688
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:07,310
Okay, so there's always two.

1689
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,770
I just didn't think they'd be like right next to each other.

1690
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:11,950
Okay, that...

1691
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,570
I know that rock is gonna kill me.

1692
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,370
I just know it.

1693
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:20,990
I knew that rock would be the death of me right there.

1694
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:24,150
Okay.

1695
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:25,990
Is it?

1696
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:27,630
Oh, no, it's not.

1697
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:28,170
Okay, thank God.

1698
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:28,450
Okay.

1699
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:29,890
I have to make sure.

1700
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:32,830
I have to make sure I don't die from that rock.

1701
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:34,590
The danger rock.

1702
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:35,950
There we go.

1703
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:42,310
Oh my god, this tank is so nice.

1704
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:44,610
Why don't we have more of this?

1705
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:52,710
Okay, let's try this again.

1706
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,230
Okay, that guy one-shot me.

1707
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:58,190
That wasn't my fault.

1708
01:10:58,190 --> 01:10:59,930
He literally one-shot me.

1709
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:03,430
Alright.

1710
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:06,470
Oh my god, he lived through all of that?

1711
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:09,550
Okay, I need to like, angle it up here.

1712
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:11,790
Hurry up.

1713
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,690
Get your ass out of here.

1714
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,230
Don't you go be throwing fucking sticky grenades.

1715
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,570
Go get near me.

1716
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:22,570
Okay.

1717
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,250
Oh my god, it's this guy.

1718
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:28,670
Fucking charge that shit up.

1719
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:31,630
Wait, there's a tank?

1720
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:32,870
There's another tank somewhere.

1721
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:36,610
Okay, where is that tank?

1722
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,820
Where is that tank?

1723
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,600
I literally saw...

1724
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,700
Oh my god, it's fine.

1725
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,580
I can overcome this rock.

1726
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:48,980
It's fine.

1727
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,580
I shall overcome my adversaries.

1728
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,060
Oh my god.

1729
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:56,820
Shouldn't have peaked?

1730
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,780
Damn, my only weakness.

1731
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,140
Rocks and walls.

1732
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:05,820
D-culture.

1733
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,360
Ah!

1734
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,060
With all the marine forces in this area.

1735
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,480
Oh, it's alright.

1736
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,560
It's just a very slow drop.

1737
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,660
Oh, hey, I made it.

1738
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,300
Oh, hey, look at that.

1739
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,400
Hey, guys.

1740
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:21,560
Oh my gosh, Sergeant Johnson, you're alive!

1741
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,160
Dropship, commonly dropship inbound.

1742
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,160
Sergeant Johnson, you did it!

1743
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,780
I knew you would live.

1744
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,000
Never doubted you for a second.

1745
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,020
Okay, let me...

1746
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,980
He can drive up this area real fast.

1747
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,200
Don't worry.

1748
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,400
I told you guys.

1749
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,420
He was just taking a nap, guys.

1750
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,680
He was just napping.

1751
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,820
Oh my god.

1752
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:53,160
Guys, I need you guys to not, like, walk around me.

1753
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,680
Guys, please!

1754
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:00,330
Okay.

1755
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:02,210
They always come in pairs.

1756
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,930
Guys, you guys got this right.

1757
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:11,910
That's

1758
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,480
not on me!

1759
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,560
That was not on me, guys.

1760
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,500
You cannot blame this on me.

1761
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,120
How is that my fault?

1762
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,380
Whatever happens, how is that my fault?

1763
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,140
Guys.

1764
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,870
What did I do wrong?

1765
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:40,810
Oh my god.

1766
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,510
Turn your back on me right now.

1767
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:44,690
There's more where that came from.

1768
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:46,570
Hey, nice shot.

1769
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:47,430
Here we go.

1770
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,610
There we go.

1771
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,170
There, see?

1772
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:53,630
They're all still alive.

1773
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:54,870
But they're all...

1774
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,970
They're all still alive.

1775
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:19,810
I'm the streamer that you just want to fix.

1776
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:22,690
I'm the...

1777
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:24,150
You can fix your experience.

1778
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:26,510
Alright.

1779
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,410
Let's grab this real quick.

1780
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:31,750
I should have...

1781
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,290
Oh, wait.

1782
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:33,570
Camouflage.

1783
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:34,230
Oh, man.

1784
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:35,470
What do I need that for?

1785
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:36,850
No!

1786
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:39,250
My tank!

1787
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:43,990
Let it blow up the structure!

1788
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:46,490
No!

1789
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:52,330
All I know is tank!

1790
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:55,790
Okay.

1791
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:57,610
That's fine.

1792
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:01,270
That's fine.

1793
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,710
I don't think he knew I was there.

1794
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:03,730
I think he got confused.

1795
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,970
Alright.

1796
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:10,430
Nice.

1797
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:11,750
I'm going back.

1798
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:12,310
Wait.

1799
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:12,850
There's health?

1800
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,030
Alright, guys.

1801
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:15,990
There was always three of you, right?

1802
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:16,750
Oh, there is health.

1803
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:17,170
Nice.

1804
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:19,330
There was always three of you.

1805
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:21,270
That's what we're gonna...

1806
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:23,310
That's gonna...

1807
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,950
That's gonna be what we write on our report back.

1808
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:25,610
Okay, guys?

1809
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,710
That there was always three of you.

1810
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:33,250
When we write our report.

1811
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,160
Okay.

1812
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:39,900
What the fuck?

1813
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:40,800
Where am I getting shot?

1814
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,480
Oh, my God.

1815
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:41,880
Here.

1816
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,580
There was always two of you.

1817
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,060
That's what we're gonna write our report.

1818
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:52,820
There was always one of you.

1819
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,000
There's a rocket launcher here?

1820
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,300
Where, where?

1821
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,780
I don't see no rocket launcher.

1822
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:09,710
Oh, fuck it.

1823
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:10,070
It's fine.

1824
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:10,770
We don't need it.

1825
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:11,950
We don't need it.

1826
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:13,810
We're strong, independent John Halos.

1827
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:17,350
What the fuck?

1828
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,350
Okay, maybe I should have got a rocket launcher.

1829
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,390
It's very annoying.

1830
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:30,050
Oh, hey.

1831
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:31,010
There's two of you guys.

1832
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,330
Where did the second guy come from?

1833
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,660
Where did you guys come from?

1834
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,040
All right.

1835
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,060
I like this tactic.

1836
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,060
Let's just be in the open.

1837
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:45,340
All right.

1838
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:45,900
So there's...

1839
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:46,900
On our report back.

1840
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,830
What the fuck?

1841
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:55,730
The tiny thing saved him?

1842
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,930
Oh, I think he's gonna die.

1843
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:02,850
Maybe.

1844
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:09,170
Okay, that shot was sicked up.

1845
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:12,250
You have to admit, that was a sick-ass shot.

1846
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:14,970
Oh, fuck.

1847
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:16,330
Okay.

1848
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:17,010
Fuck.

1849
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:17,930
Okay, this is bad.

1850
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:22,850
Okay, this is very bad.

1851
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:27,420
Okay.

1852
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,340
It's fine.

1853
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,640
There's a health pack right here.

1854
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,560
My one HP.

1855
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,620
Guys, that one HP was very crucial.

1856
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,500
Where is he?

1857
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,380
Yeah, I'm gonna take the ghost.

1858
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,680
I just wanna...

1859
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,880
Make sure you grab...

1860
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,400
Get this fucker real quick.

1861
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:45,340
Oh, god.

1862
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:46,680
He's right above me, isn't he?

1863
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,040
God damn, it's blocking me!

1864
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:58,470
Oh, my god.

1865
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:59,210
I hear him.

1866
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:00,870
I hear him, too.

1867
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:02,730
That's the worst part.

1868
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,430
What?

1869
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,940
That was a shot right there!

1870
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,020
Oh, my god.

1871
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:11,360
Okay.

1872
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:15,280
Okay, he's drunk, guys.

1873
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,000
He's drunk, guys.

1874
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,860
Oh, my god.

1875
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,140
Alright, somebody was partying...

1876
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,720
Right there.

1877
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,600
There we go.

1878
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,360
That man was fucking drunk, lying.

1879
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:35,460
Don't...

1880
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,280
Don't drink and drive, chat.

1881
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,000
There we go.

1882
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:41,940
God damn, that got pissed me off.

1883
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,040
Okay, my ghost now.

1884
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:46,260
Alright, nice.

1885
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:51,750
Okay, will this hit anything?

1886
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,450
Okay, it hit something.

1887
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:57,010
Thank God.

1888
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,100
That doesn't mean to reload.

1889
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:03,680
Oh, it doesn't mean to reload.

1890
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:04,780
Wait, that's convenient.

1891
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,000
Nice.

1892
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,280
Alright.

1893
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,360
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1894
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,100
Oh, there's a boost?

1895
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:11,780
How do I boost?

1896
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,080
Oh, that's not the boost.

1897
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:16,860
Oh.

1898
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:18,320
Okay, bring the game down.

1899
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,400
Oh, is it too loud?

1900
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:20,620
Alright.

1901
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,160
Ah, shit!

1902
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,060
Oh, please tell me.

1903
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:25,360
I'm okay.

1904
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:25,780
I'm okay.

1905
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:26,440
I'm okay.

1906
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,360
Oh, no boosts didn't evolve.

1907
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:29,720
Okay.

1908
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:34,780
Alright, we're still fine.

1909
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:36,700
Get over here.

1910
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,320
Get your ass over here.

1911
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,820
I don't have my tank now, so I'm angry.

1912
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:43,380
Okay.

1913
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:44,900
Maybe it's this way?

1914
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,620
I mean, it's red, though.

1915
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:48,160
Alright.

1916
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:53,440
Alright.

1917
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,940
Was the sound too loud earlier?

1918
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:58,720
Where do I go?

1919
01:19:58,780 --> 01:19:59,580
Oh, it has to be here.

1920
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,180
Yeah.

1921
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:06,710
Open.

1922
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:10,650
There you go.

1923
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:11,810
Yay!

1924
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,530
I'm bringing this here with me.

1925
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,030
It's okay.

1926
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:18,730
Just a flexible.

1927
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:23,390
You think I care that you guys were sleeping?

1928
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:24,910
That's right.

1929
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,770
Bring this car with me.

1930
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,730
Please, can you guys be in range of my car, though?

1931
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:36,410
Now this is...

1932
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:36,690
Hey, yo.

1933
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:38,610
Alright, I gotta fit this through.

1934
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:39,910
Sorry.

1935
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:40,530
Give me a sec.

1936
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:41,870
Guys, I got...

1937
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:42,770
It's a little tight.

1938
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:48,250
Give me a sec.

1939
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:50,130
I almost got it through.

1940
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:51,130
Don't worry.

1941
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:55,550
You think you can just go through tight spaces and avoid me?

1942
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:57,170
That's fucking right.

1943
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:59,070
Can't afford this.

1944
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:00,110
Oh, no.

1945
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:01,090
Wait.

1946
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:02,130
Wait, actually.

1947
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:03,030
Wait, does this fit?

1948
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:04,570
Give me a sec.

1949
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:08,130
I can't fit in.

1950
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,350
That's right.

1951
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:15,950
I got...

1952
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,510
Okay, that almost killed me, but that's fine.

1953
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:22,110
That's fine.

1954
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:22,730
I made it.

1955
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:24,950
That actually almost killed me.

1956
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:26,710
He's gonna death star me again.

1957
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:29,690
Wait.

1958
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:33,470
Is it gonna explode?

1959
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:37,790
No, it's fine, see?

1960
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:39,430
Look at that, it's fine.

1961
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:44,190
It's fine.

1962
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,310
I gotta fuck this one guy in particular.

1963
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,670
I can't be bothered with him.

1964
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:53,310
See, it's just... Look, guys.

1965
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:54,410
Watch this.

1966
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:55,390
See, look.

1967
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:57,650
It's okay.

1968
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:59,830
I put like seven bullets in there.

1969
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:01,710
Go on.

1970
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:02,930
No, it's okay.

1971
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:07,670
I just... Wait, what?

1972
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:11,210
Okay, let me check.

1973
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:12,450
Okay, I'll check the HP.

1974
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:16,430
Yeah, see?

1975
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:17,110
Look at that.

1976
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:18,150
We're so healthy.

1977
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,870
It's just two bars.

1978
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:22,930
It's fine.

1979
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:23,730
Two bars.

1980
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:25,150
That's more to end up.

1981
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:27,710
Okay, it's one bar.

1982
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:33,190
Let me... Never mind.

1983
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,730
Now it's one bar.

1984
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:36,150
I think I have to be concerned now.

1985
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:39,430
Never mind.

1986
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:44,810
Get out of here.

1987
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,350
Pew, pew.

1988
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:57,790
Oh, I can't be bothered with these guys.

1989
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:59,030
There's way too many.

1990
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:00,750
There you go.

1991
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:04,690
Yeah, right here.

1992
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:08,350
Alright.

1993
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:09,910
Nice.

1994
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:13,450
Okay, we gotta go this way because there's an arrow.

1995
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:15,430
I wanna see if there's anything extra.

1996
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:16,490
Wait, what?

1997
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:20,730
Oh, you're a brave little guy, aren't you?

1998
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:25,050
You were a brave little guy.

1999
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:28,890
Bum, ba-dum, bum, ba-dum, bum.

2000
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:31,410
Alright.

2001
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:32,730
Get pistol whipped.

2002
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,030
Oh.

2003
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:38,390
Oh yeah, this level is long.

2004
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:41,690
You try.

2005
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:43,970
I want him to feel a little brave, you know?

2006
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:49,250
At least show the grunts.

2007
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:50,870
Guys, I don't even...

2008
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:52,570
AHHHHH!

2009
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:59,170
Oh, this is that again.

2010
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:04,010
Anyway, guys, I don't even show the Marines.

2011
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:09,710
Respect if they have a sniper ammo.

2012
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:13,410
I do respect the Marines, guys.

2013
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:15,290
Thank you for your service.

2014
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,310
But if you have a sniper ammo that I need...

2015
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:25,770
I'm sorry.

2016
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:26,970
I choose me.

2017
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:29,550
Jesus Christ.

2018
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:32,510
He like went everywhere, but like show me his head.

2019
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:34,070
That's actually crazy.

2020
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:38,610
Like he...

2021
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:39,530
Oh my God, that's it.

2022
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:40,910
I can't be bothered.

2023
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:47,670
I can't be bothered with this fucker.

2024
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:51,370
I think it's like...

2025
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:53,210
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

2026
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:57,170
Alright.

2027
01:24:58,810 --> 01:24:59,230
Okay.

2028
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:00,270
Get over here.

2029
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:01,110
What do you mean they're everywhere?

2030
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,090
It's just me!

2031
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:04,790
It's just John Halo.

2032
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:06,690
Get over here.

2033
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:09,050
Get over here.

2034
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:11,330
I'm wasting my ammo.

2035
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:13,730
Alright.

2036
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:19,030
Wait, there's still one more.

2037
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:20,870
Oh, you think I'm gonna leave you?

2038
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:24,350
You think I'm gonna leave you so you go back to your wife and kids?

2039
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:25,890
Get back over here.

2040
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:26,850
What's your wife's name?

2041
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,790
Oh shit!

2042
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:31,750
Oh shit!

2043
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:34,790
Oh my God.

2044
01:25:36,650 --> 01:25:37,230
There we go.

2045
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:38,670
Oh my God.

2046
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:39,410
I think that was the wife.

2047
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:43,170
There's the wipe.

2048
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:46,590
I think... Oh my god, I think that was the wipe, guys.

2049
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:47,230
Whoa!

2050
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:51,850
You go there, buddy.

2051
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:54,730
Oh my god, respect.

2052
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:56,790
Fuck you, respect, man.

2053
01:25:58,210 --> 01:25:59,590
Oh my god, wait, he's gone!

2054
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:03,530
I... I just realized... I just realized he was gone!

2055
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:06,430
I was like, wow, that guy's taking so much ammo.

2056
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:12,050
It took me too long to realize.

2057
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:13,870
I was like, wow, man.

2058
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:15,850
Why does it take so long to die?

2059
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:22,770
Oh, fuck it.

2060
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:23,790
Can't be bothered.

2061
01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:26,830
Oh shit, okay, maybe I should bother.

2062
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:30,170
What the fuck hit me there?

2063
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,670
Holy shit, I took so much damage there.

2064
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:38,110
Haha, that's looking right.

2065
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:41,410
Haha, oh my god.

2066
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:44,210
That's right.

2067
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:46,330
Get out of here.

2068
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:51,330
We only have ten bullets left.

2069
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:52,070
Fuck, okay.

2070
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,190
We gotta fly in.

2071
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,350
We need to find some ammo.

2072
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:58,310
We need to find some dead marines.

2073
01:26:58,590 --> 01:27:00,290
God, I should have kept some marines with me.

2074
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:03,270
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2075
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,510
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2076
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:06,470
It should...

2077
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:06,830
Fuck.

2078
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:09,870
So then I could have taken some of the ammo later.

2079
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:13,990
Is it here?

2080
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:14,810
It's here.

2081
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:15,450
There's the arrows.

2082
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:16,830
Yeah.

2083
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:19,530
I passed a dead marine?

2084
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:20,350
Ooh.

2085
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:21,690
Free ammo.

2086
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:25,330
Where's the dead marine?

2087
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:30,170
Where are they?

2088
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:33,370
Where are my ammo boxes?

2089
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:38,850
Near elevator?

2090
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:39,770
Oh my god.

2091
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:40,870
This is gonna be hard to find.

2092
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:42,130
Ha ha ha ha.

2093
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:44,930
Oh, here.

2094
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,710
Okay.

2095
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:46,530
For my...

2096
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:47,090
Oh shit.

2097
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:48,150
Ooh.

2098
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:50,550
Ooh.

2099
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,790
Ha ha ha ha.

2100
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:53,750
That sounds...

2101
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:55,130
Very...

2102
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:55,570
Uh...

2103
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:56,390
Wait, no.

2104
01:27:57,790 --> 01:27:58,630
No more?

2105
01:27:59,190 --> 01:27:59,950
That's it?

2106
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:01,650
Oh, there it is.

2107
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:02,470
Oh, it's a pier.

2108
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:03,470
Okay, nice.

2109
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:06,230
Sounds so squishy.

2110
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:09,190
At least I killed them together.

2111
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:10,710
Oh, they're holding hands!

2112
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:12,130
He's like...

2113
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:12,690
I...

2114
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:13,910
I tried.

2115
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:18,440
The death do his part.

2116
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:20,900
Alright.

2117
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:21,980
Nice.

2118
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,080
Alright.

2119
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:25,840
Let's see.

2120
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:29,720
Let's go...

2121
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,580
Together even.

2122
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,380
See, look at that.

2123
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:32,700
I made sure they died together.

2124
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,620
John is a very popular name.

2125
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:37,060
Okay?

2126
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:38,620
On this planet.

2127
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,240
It's like how...

2128
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,020
A lot of people are named like...

2129
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:49,760
Jesus.

2130
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:54,260
Alright, let's get rid of them.

2131
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:00,350
Oh shit!

2132
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:01,770
Alright.

2133
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:06,950
Alright.

2134
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:09,650
Alright, what is it?

2135
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:13,890
I know it's like not pronounced Jesus, but it's spelled...

2136
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:14,830
I mean, it's...

2137
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:15,890
It's like...

2138
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:16,770
Spelled like Jesus.

2139
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:18,550
Alright, let's get out here.

2140
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:25,830
Back in there...

2141
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:28,290
Back on Nerd Planet, John was a fucking hero.

2142
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:30,770
So every baby was named after John.

2143
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:32,890
Jesus?

2144
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:33,630
Yeah, Jesus.

2145
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:34,150
Yeah.

2146
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,120
I'm gonna punch that guy.

2147
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:47,050
God, I hate when...

2148
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,410
I hate that it scopes out.

2149
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:49,390
Whenever...

2150
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:52,070
I hate that it scopes out, though.

2151
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:54,630
Oh fuck!

2152
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:56,250
What the fuck?!

2153
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:58,030
What hit me?!

2154
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:00,610
Oh, nice.

2155
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:01,310
This is bulletproof.

2156
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:04,510
I don't like it when it scopes out.

2157
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:05,770
If I get shot at.

2158
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:10,730
There we go.

2159
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:13,850
There's one more.

2160
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:15,730
Oh, what?!

2161
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:16,450
He fucking...

2162
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:18,310
Okay, that was supposed to be a hit.

2163
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:21,090
He moved his head at the last second, guys.

2164
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,870
Aw, I wish there was like...

2165
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:25,590
What is it called?

2166
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:28,550
When sniper bullets pass through people.

2167
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:32,010
I wish it does that.

2168
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:32,790
That would be so cool.

2169
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:33,750
Like a creeper shot.

2170
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:34,990
Or...

2171
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:35,650
Or not.

2172
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:38,030
Pierce?

2173
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:38,910
Yeah.

2174
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:40,470
When it goes through people.

2175
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:41,990
Wait, it does?

2176
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:42,510
Collateral!

2177
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:43,730
Yeah, I wish there was collateral.

2178
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,830
Wait, is there collateral?

2179
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:48,910
Wait, it does?!

2180
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:49,830
Oh...

2181
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,120
Oh, then it's...

2182
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,540
It's just a skill issue, I guess.

2183
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:04,140
Alright, you know what?

2184
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:04,900
Fuck it.

2185
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,140
I'm tired of these guys.

2186
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,640
Yeah, look at it.

2187
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:10,980
I like how he's like...

2188
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:11,720
What the fuck was that?

2189
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:20,350
There we go.

2190
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:23,650
Just waiting for him to pop his head out.

2191
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:25,470
What's that?

2192
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,070
What's that blue thing that's coming towards me?

2193
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:28,670
Huh.

2194
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:30,570
I wonder what that could be.

2195
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:32,650
Surely it's not dangerous or anything.

2196
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:33,670
Eh.

2197
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:42,560
Fuck this.

2198
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:43,960
Get over here.

2199
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,300
Get your ass over here.

2200
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,900
Get your ass over here!

2201
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,140
Get over here!

2202
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:49,240
I'm faster than you!

2203
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:49,380
No!

2204
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:53,440
Here.

2205
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,520
Bro is just chillin'.

2206
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:57,520
Think you can run?

2207
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,820
No witnesses!

2208
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:03,290
Alright.

2209
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:04,070
Nice.

2210
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,430
I don't know how I killed him.

2211
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:18,590
Nice.

2212
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:21,990
I have to be sure.

2213
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:24,010
Hello?

2214
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:29,320
Oh.

2215
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:29,660
Oh.

2216
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,680
There's something over here.

2217
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:35,840
I don't see him though.

2218
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,300
Ooh.

2219
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,760
It's sounding scary.

2220
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,620
I hear heavy breathing.

2221
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:46,740
Can't be me.

2222
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:47,500
I'm John Halo.

2223
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:54,090
I don't like how there's heavy breathing.

2224
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:56,910
It's a little spooky.

2225
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:59,270
Okay.

2226
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:00,970
So...

2227
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:01,390
Oh nice.

2228
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:01,810
Okay.

2229
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:03,850
I don't have a lot of ammo left on this anyway.

2230
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:08,320
Okay.

2231
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:08,640
Nice.

2232
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,800
I have a rocket launcher now.

2233
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,220
Alright.

2234
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:15,360
That it?

2235
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:17,980
That was easy.

2236
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:20,980
Alright.

2237
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:32,070
Oh shit.

2238
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:33,550
That was worth it.

2239
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:37,530
The sniper was max ammo?

2240
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:38,890
Yeah, but I feel like...

2241
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:40,630
I feel like...

2242
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:41,890
I feel like...

2243
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:44,790
I feel like rocker launcher time.

2244
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:48,010
Is it actually better?

2245
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:48,950
I don't know.

2246
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:50,870
Maybe I'll just use it for...

2247
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:56,080
I don't know.

2248
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:56,100
Alright.

2249
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:56,740
I'll use it.

2250
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,540
I don't know.

2251
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:59,560
I feel like...

2252
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:00,900
I feel like...

2253
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,000
I feel boom boom time.

2254
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:03,940
I wanna boom boom.

2255
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,440
It's boom boom time.

2256
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,100
No, we keep the pistol.

2257
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,040
The pistol is so good.

2258
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,720
Okay.

2259
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:12,060
That was a little...

2260
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:12,620
Stupid for him.

2261
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:13,180
Alright.

2262
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:17,240
It's boom boom time.

2263
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,040
Alright.

2264
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,040
Hello, aliens.

2265
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,140
I'm here.

2266
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:28,730
What the fuck?

2267
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,810
He just ran away from the rocket?

2268
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:32,710
Okay.

2269
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:34,370
I don't feel like boom boom time.

2270
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:41,570
Bro, that guy just dodged the entire rocket.

2271
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:44,950
Okay.

2272
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:46,090
He can't dodge that though.

2273
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:53,830
You know what?

2274
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:54,270
Fuck this.

2275
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,330
That shit hit, right?

2276
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:57,290
God damn it.

2277
01:34:57,930 --> 01:34:58,650
Boom boom time.

2278
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:02,290
That.

2279
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:04,210
You know what?

2280
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:06,230
I'm gonna use the entire ammo.

2281
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:07,110
So, and then I'll grab.

2282
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,290
Are you serious?

2283
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:10,310
That the...

2284
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:11,130
Ricochet?

2285
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:15,690
Okay.

2286
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:17,550
That's bullshit.

2287
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:20,070
I'm gonna use my entire one.

2288
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:24,570
Okay.

2289
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:25,730
Oh shit.

2290
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:27,310
I said press tab.

2291
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:28,290
Oh, that was pretty cool.

2292
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:33,490
One more shot.

2293
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:37,710
Get over here.

2294
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:37,870
Get over here.

2295
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:41,030
Oh shit!

2296
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:41,530
He shot!

2297
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:42,950
He fucking made it back!

2298
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:44,250
Oh no.

2299
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:44,910
Oh no.

2300
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:45,510
I fucked up.

2301
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:48,090
I fucked up.

2302
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:49,750
My heals.

2303
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:50,570
Don't worry.

2304
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:51,590
I'm going back for my sniper.

2305
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:54,930
Don't worry guys.

2306
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:55,810
I'll be right back.

2307
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:56,730
Pause the fight.

2308
01:35:56,730 --> 01:35:57,730
Wait.

2309
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:58,030
Oh shit.

2310
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:59,250
Wait, where's my pistol?

2311
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:01,070
Thank God.

2312
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:01,790
Okay, there it is.

2313
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:02,290
Oh shit.

2314
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:03,570
There we go.

2315
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:05,690
I was trying to swap this gun.

2316
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:07,050
Alright.

2317
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:08,730
Pause.

2318
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:09,690
Pause guys.

2319
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:10,470
Parley.

2320
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:11,050
Parley.

2321
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:14,030
Nice.

2322
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:14,590
Alright.

2323
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:16,250
Sniper rifle time.

2324
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:17,250
Time out guys.

2325
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:19,910
We each get like one five minute time out.

2326
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:21,350
The coach called a time out guys.

2327
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,310
Hahaha.

2328
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:23,810
Hahaha.

2329
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:26,570
Alright.

2330
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:29,890
Reload this.

2331
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:32,310
It's fine.

2332
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:34,750
I no longer feel like it's boom boom time.

2333
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:34,830
Yeah.

2334
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:36,450
I've had my...

2335
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,410
I have my fill.

2336
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,720
Jesus Christ.

2337
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:49,160
Alright.

2338
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:57,060
Okay, if I knew he was just going to show his head like that.

2339
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:58,300
I knew that earlier.

2340
01:36:58,820 --> 01:36:59,260
Hahaha.

2341
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:00,840
Oh my god.

2342
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:01,340
That shield.

2343
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,000
Save that man's life.

2344
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:04,680
Come on.

2345
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,060
Wait, are you dead?

2346
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:07,600
Oh, he's dead.

2347
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:11,040
Alright.

2348
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:11,720
Up I go.

2349
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,020
Ah!

2350
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,400
He fucking baited me!

2351
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:15,120
Haha.

2352
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,220
He's like...

2353
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:17,480
Right behind you.

2354
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:21,860
Hell yeah.

2355
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:23,800
Jesus Christ.

2356
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,300
How many shots?

2357
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,040
Okay, he's dead.

2358
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,880
I was gonna be like, Jesus Christ.

2359
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,480
That guy live forever.

2360
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:42,830
Okay, I thought that was the head.

2361
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:43,190
Right?

2362
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:43,770
That's good.

2363
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:46,310
Get out of here.

2364
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:47,110
I'm mad now.

2365
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:48,210
Hahaha.

2366
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:51,910
Get over here.

2367
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:54,290
I recharge my shield so I can melee you.

2368
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:55,230
Get out!

2369
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:56,690
I know there's one more.

2370
01:37:56,990 --> 01:37:57,950
Where you hiding?

2371
01:37:58,650 --> 01:37:59,110
Hahaha.

2372
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:02,750
Where are you little guy?

2373
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:04,310
Hahaha.

2374
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,110
Molo, thank you for the super chat.

2375
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:08,410
Thank you.

2376
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:08,810
Thank you.

2377
01:38:08,890 --> 01:38:11,430
Do not fire in backgrounds and atmosphere.

2378
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:12,990
Where are you?

2379
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:13,570
What?

2380
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:14,070
Did you die?

2381
01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:15,610
Oh, I think he's dead.

2382
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:17,410
I actually don't know where he went.

2383
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,550
Oh, he sits still.

2384
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:22,810
I can't see people when you're standing still.

2385
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:25,070
Alright.

2386
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:26,850
Oh!

2387
01:38:26,930 --> 01:38:27,750
I'm outside again.

2388
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:33,180
Hello?

2389
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:39,870
Okay.

2390
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,630
I didn't think they would.

2391
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:42,710
I should hit them.

2392
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:44,070
Okay.

2393
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:44,670
I guess not.

2394
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:46,830
I guess not.

2395
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:50,170
Okay, guys.

2396
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:51,130
Calm down.

2397
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:55,250
Calm down, guys.

2398
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:57,890
Where's the...

2399
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:00,350
Where's the boss?

2400
01:39:03,010 --> 01:39:06,890
Where's the main guy?

2401
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:09,430
Oh, he...

2402
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:10,550
Oh, he went backwards?

2403
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:14,570
There we go.

2404
01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:16,250
Okay.

2405
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:17,950
We're gonna have to shoot this guy's back.

2406
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,730
Jesus Christ, that was close.

2407
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:22,710
Can he shoot himself?

2408
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:25,870
Did he die?

2409
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:29,990
Wait.

2410
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:30,570
Oh, no.

2411
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:31,010
He's okay.

2412
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:31,430
Okay.

2413
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:32,090
I was gonna say.

2414
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:33,050
What happened to him?

2415
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:37,850
It's fine.

2416
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:43,330
It's the other bridge you passed.

2417
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:44,370
The wall.

2418
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,380
It's not fair.

2419
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,360
They're camping me.

2420
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:53,240
Oh, that's a window right here.

2421
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:54,580
What the fuck are you doing?

2422
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,840
It's not fair.

2423
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:57,680
They're camping.

2424
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,100
Oh, my God.

2425
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:01,340
How do I get out of here?

2426
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:02,260
Oh, wait.

2427
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:02,560
Nice.

2428
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:03,880
There we go.

2429
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:05,500
Turn your back.

2430
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,360
Get back shotted.

2431
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:09,980
You made a fatal mistake, buddy.

2432
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,080
That's fucking right.

2433
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:19,590
Okay, maybe he'll, like, turn around here.

2434
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:19,910
Okay.

2435
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:21,390
That's good.

2436
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:24,010
Okay, he's gonna turn around because he wants to shoot me here.

2437
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:26,550
And then when he turns around, I'll see him.

2438
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:28,750
Okay, not yet.

2439
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:30,890
Not yet.

2440
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:35,250
He'll turn around eventually, guys.

2441
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:35,950
Okay.

2442
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:39,550
Guys, I swear to God.

2443
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:41,910
He'll turn around eventually.

2444
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,630
Come on.

2445
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:45,670
Come on.

2446
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:46,370
Come on.

2447
01:40:46,930 --> 01:40:47,390
Come on.

2448
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:49,210
No hunter left behind.

2449
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:52,790
Oh, my God.

2450
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:58,570
Oh, my God.

2451
01:40:58,750 --> 01:40:59,450
Now you...

2452
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:03,680
Maybe one.

2453
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:04,280
He'll do it.

2454
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,300
I swear to God, guys.

2455
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:06,800
He's gonna do it.

2456
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:08,820
Guys, I swear to God.

2457
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:12,240
He'll do it.

2458
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,140
He'll do it eventually, guys.

2459
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:17,900
I have enough ammo.

2460
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:18,580
Oh, my God.

2461
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:19,100
The reload!

2462
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:23,280
Of fucking course.

2463
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,400
Of course.

2464
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,720
He doesn't want to reload.

2465
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,920
This fucker.

2466
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:35,860
Oh, fuck yeah.

2467
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:36,180
I can't.

2468
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:37,720
I have enough ammo.

2469
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:38,440
Again!

2470
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:40,280
Oh, my God.

2471
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,880
He keeps doing it when I'm reloading.

2472
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:45,180
I got time so hard.

2473
01:41:50,030 --> 01:41:50,570
Okay.

2474
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:52,530
What's that?

2475
01:41:54,370 --> 01:41:54,910
All right.

2476
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:56,250
We gotta get rid of the big boy first.

2477
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:00,150
All right.

2478
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:00,470
Nice.

2479
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:04,730
He knows he has the advantage.

2480
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:08,390
Okay.

2481
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:09,630
We're guys.

2482
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:15,040
What the fuck are you doing?

2483
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:16,240
Wait, that's not your head.

2484
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:16,600
Oh!

2485
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:20,260
It's fine.

2486
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:20,540
He's dead.

2487
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:20,980
Oh, my God.

2488
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:21,860
I hit a head shot there.

2489
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:23,220
That's right.

2490
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,180
You saw that, didn't you?

2491
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:29,460
That's right.

2492
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:30,360
That's right.

2493
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,680
Intentional head shot.

2494
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:40,750
If I scream louder, I get more accurate.

2495
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:42,230
With my aim.

2496
01:42:42,470 --> 01:42:44,210
I think I realized that.

2497
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:47,370
The louder I scream, the more accurate my shots get.

2498
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:54,390
Oh, fuck this guy.

2499
01:42:54,570 --> 01:42:55,510
His shots barely do anything.

2500
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:05,960
I'm not wasting ammo.

2501
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,360
Get over here.

2502
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,160
Get out of here.

2503
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:17,520
Get over here.

2504
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,680
I have enough shield for this.

2505
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,520
Get your ass over here.

2506
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,380
Get over here.

2507
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:31,660
Okay.

2508
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:33,100
All right.

2509
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:34,040
There we go.

2510
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,780
I have enough shield.

2511
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,440
Help me!

2512
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:38,580
Help me!

2513
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:41,460
Nobody's gonna help you.

2514
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:47,140
It's the Olympic time.

2515
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:48,560
Holy shit.

2516
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,560
His final cry was to his friend.

2517
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:54,680
He looked at his friend and was like, Please help me!

2518
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:58,220
No one's gonna help you.

2519
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,820
Welcome to the real world.

2520
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:06,490
Oh shit!

2521
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:06,750
Oh shit!

2522
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:10,980
All right.

2523
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:12,940
Okay, they're not scary.

2524
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:15,940
When- When it's just like him by himself.

2525
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,560
He literally just by himself.

2526
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:21,560
And I'm like, oh hey there.

2527
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:21,820
Yeah, alright, bro!

2528
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:27,860
That's right.

2529
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:28,620
That's right!

2530
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:30,200
When you're try to be stealthy.

2531
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:32,940
Don't F si** announce that you're next to me!

2532
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,140
Before you take the shot!

2533
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:44,060
Do not blow your cover before you fucking ambush them.

2534
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:46,100
Stupid.

2535
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:48,000
Wait, there's people above me.

2536
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:51,860
Did you see me?

2537
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,060
Oh, no.

2538
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:55,220
Oh, shit.

2539
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:56,260
I think you saw me, guys.

2540
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,240
Oh, shit.

2541
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,020
Guys, I think you saw me.

2542
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:08,480
Okay, wait.

2543
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:09,200
I'm at you.

2544
01:45:15,790 --> 01:45:18,910
Guys, I am John Halo.

2545
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:20,810
Watch this.

2546
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:29,230
Guys, don't watch this anymore.

2547
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:29,770
Stop.

2548
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:30,630
Stop watching.

2549
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:31,630
Stop watching.

2550
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:32,090
Please.

2551
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:33,050
Stop watching.

2552
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:38,330
Oh, my God.

2553
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:38,710
Please.

2554
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:39,750
Oh, my God.

2555
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:42,470
I don't know if I... I don't know if I can keep surviving this.

2556
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:42,810
Okay.

2557
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:44,390
I am John Halo.

2558
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:49,810
That's me.

2559
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:51,290
I did it.

2560
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:54,310
Look at that.

2561
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:55,710
I survived.

2562
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:57,030
Oh, hey.

2563
01:45:57,410 --> 01:45:58,650
There's dead Marines here.

2564
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:00,570
Why are there so many dead Marines here?

2565
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:04,110
Okay, we need the ammo.

2566
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:05,110
Oh, and the heals.

2567
01:46:06,330 --> 01:46:06,810
There's...

2568
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:08,610
Okay.

2569
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:09,930
Oh, I didn't take...

2570
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:10,630
Oh, my God.

2571
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:13,830
Before you died, you didn't take any sniper ammo with you?

2572
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:17,830
Get out of here.

2573
01:46:20,670 --> 01:46:21,870
I have enough.

2574
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:23,070
Get over here.

2575
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:25,270
Get your ass over here.

2576
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:26,430
I have enough shields for this.

2577
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:27,030
Yeah.

2578
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:27,850
I'm gonna shoot you.

2579
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:28,310
Watch this.

2580
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:30,450
Get over here.

2581
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:32,170
Oh, my God.

2582
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:33,090
Oh, my God.

2583
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:33,930
Oh, my God.

2584
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:36,530
I didn't expect your buddy to shoot, too.

2585
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:38,450
Get out of here.

2586
01:46:39,130 --> 01:46:40,010
Where'd you live?

2587
01:46:41,410 --> 01:46:42,090
That's right.

2588
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:43,770
I'm gonna shoot your ankles.

2589
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:45,610
That's fucking right.

2590
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:47,410
Get your ankles shot.

2591
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:50,070
You got high frames.

2592
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:51,620
Yeah, it's like, how the fuck...

2593
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:53,090
What the fuck you live?

2594
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:54,690
How did you live?

2595
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:58,290
How the fuck did you live?

2596
01:46:59,190 --> 01:47:00,550
It's one minute.

2597
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:02,930
Oh, my God.

2598
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:05,730
These guys live through by one minute.

2599
01:47:08,110 --> 01:47:09,530
Yeah, he tanked that.

2600
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:12,090
Oh, the red one is double HP.

2601
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:18,430
Okay.

2602
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:20,790
Gotta make sure he doesn't take that shit.

2603
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:21,630
That shit.

2604
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:31,040
Oh, my head.

2605
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:31,320
Stupid.

2606
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,020
Oh, no.

2607
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,160
Oh, no.

2608
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:33,840
Oh, no.

2609
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:34,320
Not him.

2610
01:47:36,580 --> 01:47:37,880
Do we always charge the shield?

2611
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:41,700
Let me get rid of this guy first.

2612
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:46,120
I don't trust myself to run across.

2613
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:49,860
Okay, now I run.

2614
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:51,280
Now I run.

2615
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:52,320
Now I'm booking it.

2616
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:53,520
Go, Doki.

2617
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:53,860
Go.

2618
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:55,320
Go, Doki.

2619
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:55,640
Go.

2620
01:47:59,950 --> 01:48:00,710
What the fuck?

2621
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:01,710
How do I drive this?

2622
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:05,130
Oh, shit.

2623
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:06,530
Wait, it's like a mini tank.

2624
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:09,190
Oh, nice.

2625
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:10,310
Oh, did he live?

2626
01:48:11,330 --> 01:48:12,210
How did he live?

2627
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:15,210
Get over here.

2628
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:17,070
There we go.

2629
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:18,670
Oh, shit!

2630
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:20,010
Oh!

2631
01:48:22,150 --> 01:48:22,350
Oh!

2632
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:24,770
Resistance appears to be increasing.

2633
01:48:25,070 --> 01:48:26,650
It must be close to the control center.

2634
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:27,330
Okay.

2635
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:29,070
I do this again, I guess.

2636
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:30,810
Analyzing.

2637
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:33,070
Oh, my God.

2638
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:33,630
This sucks.

2639
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:34,770
Okay.

2640
01:48:34,830 --> 01:48:35,190
That sucked.

2641
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:37,570
Because I couldn't scope in.

2642
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:42,030
Get me out of here.

2643
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:43,390
Get me out of here.

2644
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:45,510
Get me out of here.

2645
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:50,250
Alright.

2646
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:52,670
Okay.

2647
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:53,730
I'm gonna wait.

2648
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:55,790
Before I...

2649
01:48:55,790 --> 01:48:58,570
I couldn't, like, get a scope in there.

2650
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:04,400
Okay.

2651
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:06,480
I have to get him out here before I do anything.

2652
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:09,240
Look at this guy.

2653
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,380
Man, I should be able to get us...

2654
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:11,840
There we go.

2655
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,900
Wait, he got up?

2656
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,780
No!

2657
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,320
I didn't know I could fly!

2658
01:49:32,890 --> 01:49:33,510
Oh,

2659
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:37,640
my...

2660
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:39,420
Oh, that's awkward.

2661
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:43,060
I didn't realize it was a plane!

2662
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,320
It looks so different when it's on the ground!

2663
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:50,760
Oh, my God.

2664
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,320
I can't believe it.

2665
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,920
I missed the plane!

2666
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,460
Oh, my God.

2667
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:01,020
Where's the cockpit for this?

2668
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,500
Does this hit kill him?

2669
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:07,890
Okay.

2670
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:08,370
It's not...

2671
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:09,130
That's not fair.

2672
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:10,070
Alright.

2673
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:10,430
Okay.

2674
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:10,970
One more name.

2675
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:12,770
Oh, my God.

2676
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:13,410
That's not fair.

2677
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:14,470
That's actually not fair.

2678
01:50:14,910 --> 01:50:16,570
I'll just kill this guy because I'm angry.

2679
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:22,750
I'm sorry.

2680
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:23,090
I'm sorry.

2681
01:50:23,090 --> 01:50:25,690
It looked like a car when it's on the ground.

2682
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:31,590
It was so car-shaped.

2683
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,360
It was just car-shaped.

2684
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:39,880
God!

2685
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,700
I didn't mess up.

2686
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:43,080
Thank you.

2687
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:44,160
It was a super chat.

2688
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:44,700
Thank you.

2689
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:45,500
Thank you.

2690
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:50,720
Oh, my God.

2691
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:51,780
That could have been me.

2692
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,500
That could have been me right there.

2693
01:50:58,910 --> 01:50:59,390
Okay.

2694
01:50:59,630 --> 01:50:59,670
Okay.

2695
01:50:59,670 --> 01:51:00,290
It looked like...

2696
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:00,410
Okay.

2697
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:01,250
You can't say it has wings.

2698
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:02,990
More...

2699
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:06,490
It looked more like a penis than it did a plane.

2700
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:07,650
You have to admit that.

2701
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:08,770
You can't lie.

2702
01:51:12,570 --> 01:51:14,890
It looked like a dick with balls.

2703
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:15,770
Okay.

2704
01:51:16,290 --> 01:51:16,410
True.

2705
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:20,110
It looks like...

2706
01:51:20,110 --> 01:51:22,490
It looks more like a dick with balls.

2707
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:24,110
And you guys know that.

2708
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:31,790
It barely looked like a...

2709
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:32,210
I don't know!

2710
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:33,990
Oh, my God.

2711
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:35,150
Please, I'm trying to...

2712
01:51:35,150 --> 01:51:36,350
Guys, I'm distracted.

2713
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:37,750
I'm trying to fucking...

2714
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:40,950
Oh, my God.

2715
01:51:41,650 --> 01:51:42,770
Oh, my God.

2716
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:44,630
I'm trying to do this melee thing.

2717
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:48,190
Okay.

2718
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:48,850
That works, too.

2719
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:52,190
I'll take that.

2720
01:51:52,770 --> 01:51:54,270
That works, too.

2721
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:58,410
Oh, my God.

2722
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:00,190
Of course, that's fucking...

2723
01:52:04,030 --> 01:52:04,950
There we go.

2724
01:52:07,010 --> 01:52:08,290
We take those.

2725
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:09,870
We fucking take those.

2726
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:13,450
Okay.

2727
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:15,970
We're fine.

2728
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:21,070
We're so fine.

2729
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:25,010
Alright, it's melee time.

2730
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:27,190
They're little babies.

2731
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:29,050
I'm gonna kill this guy in his sleep.

2732
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:30,870
So he'll...

2733
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:31,590
It's good!

2734
01:52:31,770 --> 01:52:32,730
He died in his sleep.

2735
01:52:33,030 --> 01:52:34,270
It's like he never suffered.

2736
01:52:36,710 --> 01:52:37,190
Okay.

2737
01:52:37,290 --> 01:52:37,670
I need to...

2738
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:38,370
Shoot you.

2739
01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:39,690
So I can melee you.

2740
01:52:41,190 --> 01:52:42,130
Get out of here.

2741
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:43,930
What the fuck hit me?

2742
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:45,310
Oh, my God.

2743
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:46,230
He brought his dad!

2744
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:51,610
His dad's here.

2745
01:52:53,010 --> 01:52:54,130
He got his older brother.

2746
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:58,560
Okay.

2747
01:52:58,620 --> 01:52:59,520
You're too far in melee.

2748
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,380
Oh, wait.

2749
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:06,520
No, that's just his older brother.

2750
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:07,600
No, I can kill him, too.

2751
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:09,740
I'll get rid of your older brother.

2752
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,200
Bleeding the family line.

2753
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:15,860
Wait.

2754
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:16,520
Wait a minute.

2755
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:17,000
Okay.

2756
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:18,000
Okay.

2757
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:19,960
The family flank.

2758
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:22,220
Oh, no.

2759
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:22,740
Fuck.

2760
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:23,180
Okay.

2761
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:24,120
I got too cocky.

2762
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,160
They're working together.

2763
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:30,280
My HP.

2764
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:32,620
That's it.

2765
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:34,980
I'm taking high ground.

2766
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:36,400
Get over here.

2767
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:39,300
You thought I couldn't get to high ground?

2768
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:41,940
You know I'm serious when I parkour.

2769
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:47,620
Okay.

2770
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:48,300
Here we go.

2771
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:51,380
Is there...

2772
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:52,120
Is there...

2773
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,660
Is there like any...

2774
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:55,760
Oh my god.

2775
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:56,340
Is there...

2776
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:57,320
Get Ohana.

2777
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:02,040
Is there any dead marines?

2778
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,620
Anywhere?

2779
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,980
Any dead marines that could spare me some heathens?

2780
01:54:07,860 --> 01:54:08,860
Oh, no.

2781
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:09,910
No dead marines.

2782
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:12,780
Alright.

2783
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,400
Holy shit.

2784
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:15,460
This level is long.

2785
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,320
In two hours, I'm still here.

2786
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,120
This is a giant...

2787
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:20,820
Oh, I'm going down.

2788
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:24,140
We play legendary mode with crowd control on.

2789
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:27,000
I think people would really like that.

2790
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:28,400
Imposter snake.

2791
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:29,520
Thank you for the super chat.

2792
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:29,860
Thank you.

2793
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,100
Guys, I don't even think I'll beat the game.

2794
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:37,060
Oh, hey.

2795
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,180
Wait, what?

2796
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:43,920
What is he doing?

2797
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,140
Just standing there.

2798
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:47,940
Like, this guy was just at...

2799
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:49,520
What a boring day at work.

2800
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,520
Alright, nothing ever happens here.

2801
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:58,080
Okay, I thought this...

2802
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,380
I thought it was bulletproof.

2803
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:04,940
The one time the windows are not bulletproof?

2804
01:55:07,930 --> 01:55:09,850
I was like, they're so stupid.

2805
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:12,030
Try to shoot me through a bulletproof window.

2806
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:17,350
There you go.

2807
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:22,070
Get over here.

2808
01:55:22,130 --> 01:55:22,770
Oh my god.

2809
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:24,110
He's trying to do a little circle.

2810
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:28,550
Get over here.

2811
01:55:28,570 --> 01:55:29,750
You're just a waste of ammo.

2812
01:55:30,370 --> 01:55:31,310
Get out of here.

2813
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:32,970
Any dead Marines?

2814
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:34,070
Oh, thank god.

2815
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:36,910
Thank god Marines died here.

2816
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:39,130
Alright.

2817
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:40,390
Let's get down.

2818
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:43,050
That's what he would thought.

2819
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:43,350
Alright.

2820
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:45,050
Everybody's dead.

2821
01:55:45,770 --> 01:55:46,050
Nice.

2822
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:47,170
Another family killed.

2823
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:48,210
Let's go.

2824
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:49,710
A dead...

2825
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:52,070
The only good alien is a dead alien.

2826
01:55:53,570 --> 01:55:54,510
I'm a lost, though.

2827
01:55:54,710 --> 01:55:55,510
I'm a lost.

2828
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:01,480
Uh...

2829
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:02,320
Here I go.

2830
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:04,080
What the fuck?

2831
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:07,000
Where am I?

2832
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:08,940
Oh, this is where...

2833
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:10,120
No, this is the other side.

2834
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:13,780
Damn right.

2835
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:15,020
That's right.

2836
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,900
Military propaganda is working on me.

2837
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,280
That's when you know it works.

2838
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,140
Maybe it's this way.

2839
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,820
I just ran past it.

2840
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:26,960
I'm so confused.

2841
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:27,720
Bro!

2842
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:29,400
They didn't make signs.

2843
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:34,280
How do the other aliens not get lost?

2844
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:36,020
They're so stupid.

2845
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:37,060
Oh, there's the side.

2846
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:37,680
Never mind.

2847
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:42,640
Wait.

2848
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,700
Where the fuck?

2849
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:46,920
Okay.

2850
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:48,060
I'll follow this arrow.

2851
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,340
Oh, there it is.

2852
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:51,880
It's glowing.

2853
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:52,740
There it is.

2854
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:54,600
Oh, these are the sides.

2855
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:57,800
Alright.

2856
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:01,680
Hello.

2857
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:06,580
The entrance to the control center is located at the top of the pyramid.

2858
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:07,360
Let's get up.

2859
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:10,060
We should commandeer one of those ghosts.

2860
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:11,600
We're going to need the firepower.

2861
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:13,140
Yoink.

2862
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:20,010
Yoink.

2863
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:21,950
Oh, shit!

2864
01:57:23,050 --> 01:57:23,990
That's a tank!

2865
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:26,350
Bye.

2866
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:30,170
I mean, do I have to fight all these guys?

2867
01:57:32,270 --> 01:57:33,130
No, right?

2868
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:35,710
Wait.

2869
01:57:35,810 --> 01:57:37,030
Can I even destroy the tank?

2870
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:42,010
You destroy it with regular bullets?

2871
01:57:46,150 --> 01:57:46,970
I don't know.

2872
01:57:47,950 --> 01:57:48,610
Not really?

2873
01:57:48,810 --> 01:57:49,070
Okay.

2874
01:57:49,370 --> 01:57:50,290
I'll just go over here then.

2875
01:57:51,050 --> 01:57:51,430
Hey, guys.

2876
01:57:54,930 --> 01:57:55,930
Can't get me.

2877
01:57:57,730 --> 01:57:58,750
Can't get me.

2878
01:57:59,610 --> 01:57:59,770
Can't get me.

2879
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:01,990
What you gonna do?

2880
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:03,330
Nothing.

2881
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:04,610
Oh, shit!

2882
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:06,830
Oh, fuck!

2883
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:07,250
Okay.

2884
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:07,890
Give me a sec.

2885
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:09,970
Give me a sec.

2886
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:10,730
I'll recharge.

2887
01:58:13,810 --> 01:58:15,090
Where's, like, going past?

2888
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:16,590
Jesus Christ.

2889
01:58:16,950 --> 01:58:17,830
You're so tanky.

2890
01:58:18,110 --> 01:58:21,730
I forgot how tanky you are, like, outside of shooting my pistol.

2891
01:58:23,450 --> 01:58:24,190
That's fine.

2892
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:25,490
There we go.

2893
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:26,970
He tripped and fell.

2894
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:27,230
Okay.

2895
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:28,210
Now I'm just gonna...

2896
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:29,590
Aw.

2897
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:31,310
He's like...

2898
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:32,330
Barry, you okay?

2899
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:37,770
Yeah.

2900
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:39,450
I don't think he's gonna shoot back right here.

2901
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:40,150
Honestly.

2902
01:58:43,550 --> 01:58:44,070
Whoops.

2903
01:58:44,990 --> 01:58:45,450
Sorry.

2904
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:46,290
This is an embarrassing...

2905
01:58:46,290 --> 01:58:46,610
Oh!

2906
01:58:47,450 --> 01:58:48,870
What happened to timeout?

2907
01:58:49,590 --> 01:58:49,950
God.

2908
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:50,470
Oh!

2909
01:58:50,570 --> 01:58:51,070
Oh, my God.

2910
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:51,430
He missed.

2911
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:52,150
So stupid.

2912
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:53,210
Okay.

2913
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:54,990
Okay.

2914
01:58:55,990 --> 01:58:56,510
Maybe...

2915
01:58:57,210 --> 01:58:57,730
Wait.

2916
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:58,870
I can splatter him?

2917
01:59:04,850 --> 01:59:05,810
That was a mistake.

2918
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:08,370
That was a mistake.

2919
01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:10,010
Oh!

2920
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:13,490
My car!

2921
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:17,280
Oh, no.

2922
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:19,360
Oh, no.

2923
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:20,600
Oh, no!

2924
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:22,140
There we go.

2925
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:23,520
That's okay.

2926
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:24,560
I don't need my car.

2927
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:27,000
How do I get up top here?

2928
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:27,660
Oh, it's this way.

2929
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:31,720
No, there's no boost in combat evolved.

2930
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:32,200
Yes.

2931
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,860
They said there wasn't.

2932
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:35,760
So I believe them.

2933
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:37,660
Okay.

2934
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:38,500
I can dodge that.

2935
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:42,560
Wait.

2936
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:43,400
Is that Banshee...

2937
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:43,500
No.

2938
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:44,520
That Banshee's broken.

2939
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:45,340
I'm pretty sure.

2940
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:47,280
Yeah.

2941
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:48,460
There's no...

2942
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:49,860
Is that Banshee broken?

2943
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:51,040
Look.

2944
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:52,780
Yeah.

2945
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:53,100
See?

2946
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:56,660
I'm pretty sure that looks like a...

2947
01:59:56,660 --> 01:59:56,900
Oh, wait.

2948
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:57,040
No.

2949
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:57,820
That one isn't.

2950
01:59:59,200 --> 01:59:59,760
Wait.

2951
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:00,000
No.

2952
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:00,940
That's just the wall.

2953
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:02,000
Yeah.

2954
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:02,840
I'm gonna say it.

2955
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:03,200
Like...

2956
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:04,320
I'm pretty sure.

2957
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,180
I'm pretty sure it's like...

2958
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:09,540
There's like explosive marks and everything.

2959
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:10,460
Like...

2960
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,960
It looks very, very dead.

2961
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,800
I don't know.

2962
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:16,960
I don't...

2963
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:17,600
Oh, it is.

2964
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:18,020
Okay.

2965
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:19,460
Oh, it's...

2966
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:21,060
Oh, no.

2967
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:21,960
Oh, no.

2968
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:23,180
Oh, my God.

2969
02:00:23,180 --> 02:00:24,760
It's so hard to drive these.

2970
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:28,560
Alright.

2971
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,040
That's fine.

2972
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:32,320
Oh, my God.

2973
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:33,020
This is fine.

2974
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:34,720
Oh, my God.

2975
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:35,700
This is not fine.

2976
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:41,330
Okay.

2977
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:41,750
I'm okay.

2978
02:00:41,930 --> 02:00:42,410
I'm okay.

2979
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:44,790
My ghost is maybe not okay.

2980
02:00:45,050 --> 02:00:45,650
But I'm okay.

2981
02:00:48,830 --> 02:00:49,350
Okay.

2982
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:49,630
Nice.

2983
02:00:50,750 --> 02:00:51,630
Oh, my God.

2984
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:52,650
Please turn around.

2985
02:00:56,130 --> 02:00:56,530
Okay.

2986
02:00:56,610 --> 02:00:58,190
I don't think my ghost is okay anymore.

2987
02:00:59,290 --> 02:00:59,690
Wait.

2988
02:00:59,790 --> 02:01:00,150
You live?

2989
02:01:00,730 --> 02:01:01,270
Oh, wait.

2990
02:01:01,450 --> 02:01:01,690
It's still...

2991
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:01,850
Okay.

2992
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:02,510
I don't trust...

2993
02:01:02,510 --> 02:01:03,110
I don't think I should.

2994
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:05,290
Legally, I think it might explode.

2995
02:01:10,770 --> 02:01:14,050
I'm pretty sure it's gonna explode if I try to do anything.

2996
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:15,750
Holy shit.

2997
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:16,710
You have too much HP.

2998
02:01:16,930 --> 02:01:17,890
Someone needs to put you down.

2999
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:20,110
And that person is me.

3000
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:29,310
All right.

3001
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:34,110
Hello, hello, everybody.

3002
02:01:35,730 --> 02:01:36,930
It's okay.

3003
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:38,830
Why the fuck did he...

3004
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:46,220
Oh, he's like, hey.

3005
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:50,380
All right.

3006
02:01:53,790 --> 02:01:54,430
What?

3007
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:57,010
That literally passed through him.

3008
02:01:58,570 --> 02:01:59,450
Oh, no.

3009
02:01:59,710 --> 02:02:00,670
Where's the second guy?

3010
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:02,210
Where's his buddy?

3011
02:02:02,890 --> 02:02:04,190
Where's his buddy?

3012
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:06,650
I know you come in pairs.

3013
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,740
Oh, what?

3014
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:12,440
No!

3015
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:13,840
There's the second guy!

3016
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:14,920
There he is!

3017
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:18,180
I got baited again!

3018
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:24,640
The world record for this level on Legendary is 3 minutes and 20...

3019
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:24,920
Oh, my.

3020
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:26,280
They give us a super chat.

3021
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,600
That's crazy.

3022
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:29,500
Distraction.

3023
02:02:30,340 --> 02:02:32,560
I don't need the turret.

3024
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:36,400
All I need is one shot.

3025
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:41,340
That's all I need.

3026
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:43,600
Oh, my God.

3027
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:43,820
Okay.

3028
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,520
But I also need them to turn their backs on me.

3029
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:47,560
Come on.

3030
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:48,880
Come on.

3031
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:51,660
Are you serious?

3032
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:52,800
Oh, my God.

3033
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:54,340
But, like...

3034
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:55,420
Not now, though.

3035
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,020
Come on.

3036
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,040
Turn your backs on me.

3037
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:00,140
Come on.

3038
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:01,860
Reposition yourself.

3039
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:05,100
God damn it.

3040
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:05,380
Okay.

3041
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:07,280
Reposition yourself, like, now.

3042
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:09,200
There we go.

3043
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:11,180
That works.

3044
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:13,640
I shot him in the side.

3045
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:16,960
Oh, no.

3046
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:17,800
Oh, no.

3047
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,980
I'm so bad at, like, dodging those.

3048
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:23,800
Oh!

3049
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:25,760
God damn it!

3050
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:28,560
God damn it, I'm so...

3051
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:28,960
No!

3052
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:36,720
No, don't tell me I...

3053
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:37,460
Oh, thank God.

3054
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:37,800
Okay.

3055
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:38,940
Which way?

3056
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:39,260
Okay.

3057
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:41,840
Not me!

3058
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:44,420
Okay, you did it again.

3059
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,380
I...

3060
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:46,640
Oh, my...

3061
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:57,920
Okay, I didn't think he was gonna do that.

3062
02:03:58,020 --> 02:03:58,280
Okay?

3063
02:03:58,500 --> 02:03:59,280
To be fair.

3064
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:03,000
Just shoot him on the legs.

3065
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:08,580
Okay, when I say reposition himself, I meant him.

3066
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,540
I meant him, not me.

3067
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:16,720
He should come out soon.

3068
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:22,040
Okay, maybe he'll let...

3069
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:24,160
Show yourself.

3070
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:26,740
Where's the second guy?

3071
02:04:30,730 --> 02:04:31,790
Okay, that works.

3072
02:04:32,590 --> 02:04:33,430
That works.

3073
02:04:33,970 --> 02:04:34,370
Thank God.

3074
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:40,330
Alright, one by one, everybody.

3075
02:04:40,610 --> 02:04:41,430
One by one.

3076
02:04:42,610 --> 02:04:43,570
Single file.

3077
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,080
Okay, you think he sees me?

3078
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:53,780
Okay, I think from that glowing green light...

3079
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:54,960
He saw me.

3080
02:04:55,740 --> 02:04:56,500
There you go.

3081
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:00,020
That was...

3082
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:00,740
That run...

3083
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:01,860
Was a lot better.

3084
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:03,460
That run...

3085
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:04,900
Smell, thank you for the super chat.

3086
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:05,800
Thank you, thank you.

3087
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:09,360
The world record has three minutes because there's a trick where you can get a banshee...

3088
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:11,420
Which disciples all spawns?

3089
02:05:11,660 --> 02:05:12,940
Wait, then just fucking...

3090
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,340
Flies to the end goal?

3091
02:05:15,820 --> 02:05:16,780
Thank you for the super chat.

3092
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:17,780
Thank you, thank you.

3093
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:19,180
Oh, that's crazy.

3094
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:21,460
Oh, what's that?

3095
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:22,580
Oh.

3096
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,240
Oh my god.

3097
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:31,600
Oh my god.

3098
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:33,880
Oh my god, I see him.

3099
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:35,940
It's okay.

3100
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:37,800
I don't think he sees me.

3101
02:05:45,230 --> 02:05:45,670
Okay.

3102
02:05:46,150 --> 02:05:46,750
It's fine.

3103
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:50,050
It's okay.

3104
02:05:51,230 --> 02:05:52,330
I have more nades.

3105
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:54,310
I don't know where it's gonna go, but I'll hit something.

3106
02:05:57,890 --> 02:05:59,490
I got your legs.

3107
02:05:59,710 --> 02:06:01,370
I got your legs.

3108
02:06:01,550 --> 02:06:03,610
I got your legs.

3109
02:06:03,810 --> 02:06:03,930
I got your legs.

3110
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:05,190
I got...

3111
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:06,350
Legs stuck.

3112
02:06:07,030 --> 02:06:08,350
Fucking stupid.

3113
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:14,210
The easiest shot of my life.

3114
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:17,230
Oh, he's stuck.

3115
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:18,690
Upset bro, I'm stuck.

3116
02:06:20,050 --> 02:06:20,870
Wait, what?

3117
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:23,550
Yeah, we'll grab the little guys first.

3118
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:26,850
Little guys are annoying.

3119
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:33,160
I think he's dead.

3120
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:38,480
Alright, nice.

3121
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:39,380
Alright.

3122
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:40,400
I'm your nades.

3123
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:42,380
Alright.

3124
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:43,660
Over I go.

3125
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,200
Up, step chief.

3126
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:47,040
Ha ha ha ha ha.

3127
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,080
Ha ha ha ha.

3128
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:50,840
Word, word, word.

3129
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:52,540
Time to sell.

3130
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:53,380
Yeah.

3131
02:06:55,240 --> 02:06:55,880
Nice.

3132
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:58,440
Alright.

3133
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:01,940
Open?

3134
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:03,860
Open.

3135
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:09,940
Oh, I don't like that.

3136
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:11,040
Why is it so empty?

3137
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:15,400
Okay.

3138
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:16,900
For real?

3139
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:17,960
Kurtana?

3140
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:20,460
Kurtana, you're not lying?

3141
02:07:24,130 --> 02:07:25,690
Can I kill everybody?

3142
02:07:30,330 --> 02:07:31,090
Oh?

3143
02:07:32,590 --> 02:07:33,670
Hello, it's I.

3144
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:34,850
John Halo!

3145
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,030
This is it.

3146
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:38,170
Halo's control center.

3147
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:53,400
Surely it won't be an ambush or anything.

3148
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:59,820
Other guys are Grunts, Sword Boy, Racer, Elite Shield Bros, or Jackals?

3149
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:02,320
Doki... Doki Bird is a beaut.

3150
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:03,800
Thank you, Super Chat.

3151
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:05,040
Thank you, thank you, Omni.

3152
02:08:11,060 --> 02:08:13,000
I feel like I'll be ambushed or something.

3153
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:19,390
You alright?

3154
02:08:20,410 --> 02:08:21,610
Hey, Kurtana!

3155
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:22,850
Oh my god.

3156
02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:27,290
She looked like that before?

3157
02:08:28,610 --> 02:08:35,190
They definitely made her hotter in the mor- in the mor- Every sequel, they make it hotter.

3158
02:08:35,190 --> 02:08:38,230
This ring isn't a cudgel, you barbarian.

3159
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:38,950
It's something else.

3160
02:08:39,490 --> 02:08:41,530
Something much more important.

3161
02:08:42,070 --> 02:08:43,030
The covenant, we're right.

3162
02:08:43,490 --> 02:08:46,430
This ring, it's Forerunner.

3163
02:08:46,950 --> 02:08:48,050
Give me a second to access.

3164
02:08:49,410 --> 02:08:56,430
Yes, the Forerunner built this place, what they called a fortress world, in order to- What?

3165
02:08:56,830 --> 02:08:57,170
What?

3166
02:08:57,170 --> 02:08:57,710
No, that can't be.

3167
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:58,830
What is it, Kurtana?

3168
02:08:59,130 --> 02:09:00,210
Oh, those covenant fools.

3169
02:09:00,410 --> 02:09:00,970
They must have known.

3170
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:01,870
There must have been signs.

3171
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:03,150
Slow down.

3172
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:04,330
You're losing me.

3173
02:09:04,330 --> 02:09:05,250
Yeah, you're losing me too.

3174
02:09:05,510 --> 02:09:06,050
The covenant found something.

3175
02:09:06,390 --> 02:09:07,430
Buried in this ring.

3176
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:08,410
Something horrible.

3177
02:09:08,710 --> 02:09:10,150
And now, they're afraid.

3178
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:11,750
Something buried?

3179
02:09:12,030 --> 02:09:12,430
Where?

3180
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:14,030
Captain, we've got to stop the captain.

3181
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:14,850
Wait, what?

3182
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:15,470
Why?

3183
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:16,970
The weapons cache he's looking for.

3184
02:09:17,130 --> 02:09:19,050
It's not really- We can't let him get inside.

3185
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:19,870
Wait, why?

3186
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:21,090
I don't understand.

3187
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:21,930
There's no time.

3188
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:22,990
Get out of here.

3189
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:23,830
Find keys.

3190
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:24,650
Stop him.

3191
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:25,470
Wait, what?

3192
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:26,350
He said it's too late.

3193
02:09:26,770 --> 02:09:27,730
Kurtana, please!

3194
02:09:28,290 --> 02:09:30,590
What do you mean there's no time to explain?

3195
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:32,590
Kurtana!

3196
02:09:32,970 --> 02:09:34,390
Why won't you tell me?

3197
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:38,150
Oh no, I'm in the swamp now.

3198
02:09:39,670 --> 02:09:41,090
Okay, so we have to stop keys.

3199
02:09:41,090 --> 02:09:42,410
What did he do?

3200
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:46,490
Why do you have to stop keys?

3201
02:09:50,730 --> 02:09:51,990
Well, enough alone.

3202
02:10:00,350 --> 02:10:02,330
What does enhanced graphics look like?

3203
02:10:02,490 --> 02:10:04,270
Jesus Christ, it's so blue.

3204
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:05,970
Look at all these grass.

3205
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:09,970
Alright.

3206
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:12,070
Where is he?

3207
02:10:12,210 --> 02:10:12,770
Where is he?

3208
02:10:14,550 --> 02:10:16,670
Oh my god, a lot of them are dying though.

3209
02:10:23,010 --> 02:10:24,090
Get out of here.

3210
02:10:26,930 --> 02:10:27,810
Oh, checkpoint.

3211
02:10:29,670 --> 02:10:31,330
Yeah, I'm not gonna waste ammo.

3212
02:10:31,550 --> 02:10:33,550
I don't know where I can find other dead marines.

3213
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:37,630
I hear a radio transmission over here.

3214
02:10:39,390 --> 02:10:40,070
Hello?

3215
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:46,640
Hello, anybody here?

3216
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:52,230
Oh, wait, where are the marines here?

3217
02:10:52,470 --> 02:10:53,750
Is this where Captain Keys was?

3218
02:10:56,290 --> 02:10:56,630
Oh.

3219
02:10:59,370 --> 02:11:01,250
Oh, Captain Keys has been captured.

3220
02:11:05,550 --> 02:11:07,790
Okay, so Captain Keys is here.

3221
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:08,530
Okay, so Captain Keys is here.

3222
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:10,970
So...

3223
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:12,730
Is shotgun around here?

3224
02:11:13,390 --> 02:11:14,490
I don't see no shotgun.

3225
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:17,370
I'm just gonna grab the regular gun then.

3226
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:18,790
I don't like normal AR.

3227
02:11:21,730 --> 02:11:24,850
Okay, so Captain Keys is...

3228
02:11:26,530 --> 02:11:28,370
Is captured right now.

3229
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:31,470
So we gotta find him.

3230
02:11:32,530 --> 02:11:33,310
No shotgun?

3231
02:11:33,730 --> 02:11:34,150
Sad.

3232
02:11:37,010 --> 02:11:39,610
Because I guess it's too easy!

3233
02:11:39,610 --> 02:11:39,730
Pussy!

3234
02:11:45,030 --> 02:11:46,130
Oh my god.

3235
02:11:47,110 --> 02:11:49,790
Really fucking play behind a shield like a pussy?

3236
02:11:50,070 --> 02:11:50,730
Get out of here.

3237
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:55,290
Get your ass out of here.

3238
02:11:57,610 --> 02:11:58,210
Okay.

3239
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:00,750
Where is...

3240
02:12:00,750 --> 02:12:01,050
Wow!

3241
02:12:02,230 --> 02:12:02,990
Where did I go?

3242
02:12:04,530 --> 02:12:05,730
Swarm level is...

3243
02:12:07,830 --> 02:12:08,790
It's weird.

3244
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:11,430
I feel like this isn't the way.

3245
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:17,920
Oh my god.

3246
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:19,260
Everything is so blue.

3247
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:21,880
Look at these...

3248
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:23,540
Big fucking trees.

3249
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,160
Follow the lights?

3250
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,580
Where else would the lights go?

3251
02:12:33,380 --> 02:12:33,980
Here?

3252
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:34,720
Oh!

3253
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:36,360
I can climb up here!

3254
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:38,580
I didn't realize I can climb up the tree.

3255
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:40,180
Okay.

3256
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:42,780
Oh, it's so spooky.

3257
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:46,100
No!

3258
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:46,520
No!

3259
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:47,460
No!

3260
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:50,920
Okay.

3261
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:53,500
I thought I fell down and had to do this all over again.

3262
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:56,160
Wait, what?

3263
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:57,840
Oh, that's them!

3264
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:59,360
That's my teammates!

3265
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:05,340
Don't worry!

3266
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:09,560
Wait, why are they coming?

3267
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:09,840
Okay.

3268
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:11,000
We're gonna kill these guys first.

3269
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:13,140
These guys are annoying.

3270
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:16,900
Get out of here.

3271
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:18,400
Get out of here!

3272
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:19,640
Get out of here!

3273
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:20,200
Oh shit!

3274
02:13:20,380 --> 02:13:21,200
Okay, they haven't...

3275
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,480
Okay, there's a lot of them.

3276
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:23,480
Give me a sec.

3277
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:26,260
Don't worry.

3278
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:27,300
They don't know where I am too.

3279
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:31,500
They're just as confused.

3280
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:35,140
My best strat.

3281
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:37,120
Running around a tree.

3282
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:41,720
There we go.

3283
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:43,660
Jesus, I shot you too!

3284
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:47,400
Alright, I killed a thousand grunts.

3285
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,320
Alright, now we go in.

3286
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:50,940
Why are they running away from that area?

3287
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:52,780
Alright.

3288
02:13:53,380 --> 02:13:54,680
Time to find out why.

3289
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,220
Hello?

3290
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:01,820
Hello?

3291
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:03,760
Oh?

3292
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:08,140
Captain Keys?

3293
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,400
Oh, the elevator came back up.

3294
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:17,160
Alright.

3295
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:18,120
Down I go.

3296
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:21,040
Word, word.

3297
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:22,760
Word, word, word.

3298
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:24,880
Word, word, word.

3299
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:29,830
They were running away from here.

3300
02:14:30,110 --> 02:14:31,110
What the fuck's going on?

3301
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:38,940
Okay, I didn't realize they were...

3302
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:39,640
They were all there.

3303
02:14:43,990 --> 02:14:45,170
Alright, get out of here.

3304
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:46,850
You think you could...

3305
02:14:46,850 --> 02:14:48,330
Use this as a barrier?

3306
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:53,110
Whole gang's here.

3307
02:14:54,190 --> 02:14:54,910
Just in case.

3308
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:57,390
I don't know what's over here.

3309
02:14:57,450 --> 02:14:58,230
I heard like...

3310
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:05,020
Alright.

3311
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:06,760
Ooh.

3312
02:15:07,180 --> 02:15:08,540
Okay, let me recharge my shield a little.

3313
02:15:08,740 --> 02:15:09,100
Whoa!

3314
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:11,580
I said let me recharge my shield a little!

3315
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:12,580
Time out!

3316
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:13,860
Alright.

3317
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:16,020
Okay, now we can play.

3318
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:17,660
With this.

3319
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:21,980
I hit him?

3320
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:24,380
Haha, no shield for you.

3321
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:28,340
Hello?

3322
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:32,140
Actually, let's grab these.

3323
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:33,300
Do this real quick.

3324
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:37,900
Alright.

3325
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:39,160
Down I go!

3326
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:41,140
I don't know if I want to go down though.

3327
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,600
Wait, I hear something below me.

3328
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:49,640
Oh no, that's just my footsteps.

3329
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:50,480
Hahaha!

3330
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:54,060
I just heard myself.

3331
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:58,480
I'm tired of you.

3332
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:01,620
Wait, I was gonna say that.

3333
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:01,920
I can't.

3334
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:03,440
There's no way that breaks my legs.

3335
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:08,260
There you go.

3336
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:09,600
Must be here.

3337
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:11,080
Cause they're all guarding this one door.

3338
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:17,700
Hahaha!

3339
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:20,480
Not being a good guard, so.

3340
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:21,320
Hahaha!

3341
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:27,800
What?!

3342
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:29,140
Okay, that phased through!

3343
02:16:29,420 --> 02:16:30,780
There's no way!

3344
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:32,940
That shit actually phased through!

3345
02:16:33,300 --> 02:16:33,880
That's bullshit!

3346
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:36,140
That's actually bullshit!

3347
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:40,300
Fuck this.

3348
02:16:44,710 --> 02:16:45,770
Get it.

3349
02:16:47,790 --> 02:16:48,330
Alright.

3350
02:16:48,830 --> 02:16:49,830
That's fucking right.

3351
02:16:50,090 --> 02:16:51,330
No more shield for you.

3352
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:54,670
Word wart.

3353
02:16:54,990 --> 02:16:55,410
Wait, what?

3354
02:16:56,350 --> 02:16:57,410
What is that?

3355
02:16:59,350 --> 02:16:59,690
Huh?

3356
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:01,630
What's that green thing?

3357
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:04,130
Whoa!

3358
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:06,510
Bye.

3359
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:08,190
Oh.

3360
02:17:08,650 --> 02:17:08,870
Oh.

3361
02:17:09,370 --> 02:17:10,530
I didn't kill these guys.

3362
02:17:11,790 --> 02:17:12,710
What the fuck?

3363
02:17:13,130 --> 02:17:14,370
What happened here?

3364
02:17:15,450 --> 02:17:16,910
I didn't kill them.

3365
02:17:19,290 --> 02:17:20,570
What the fuck?

3366
02:17:21,350 --> 02:17:23,110
Wait, it's the green thing again.

3367
02:17:24,710 --> 02:17:25,470
Huh.

3368
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:38,170
Oh.

3369
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:42,430
What's going on?

3370
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:43,630
What's going on?

3371
02:17:43,630 --> 02:17:43,990
I fell in.

3372
02:17:44,090 --> 02:17:44,870
Thank you for the super chat.

3373
02:17:44,990 --> 02:17:45,210
Thank you.

3374
02:17:45,450 --> 02:17:45,950
Thank you.

3375
02:17:46,510 --> 02:17:47,090
What, what, what?

3376
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:48,110
Hello?

3377
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:50,750
Hey, it's me!

3378
02:17:53,970 --> 02:17:54,410
What?

3379
02:17:54,410 --> 02:17:55,790
I'll blow your brains out!

3380
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:01,320
You freaks!

3381
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:02,220
I won't be like you!

3382
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:02,980
I'll die first!

3383
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:03,660
Dead!

3384
02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:08,110
That's what I did!

3385
02:18:08,350 --> 02:18:08,910
Played dead!

3386
02:18:09,150 --> 02:18:10,070
They took the live ones!

3387
02:18:10,270 --> 02:18:11,970
Oh god, I can still hear them!

3388
02:18:12,770 --> 02:18:13,250
Monsters!

3389
02:18:14,810 --> 02:18:18,210
Are the monsters in the room here with us right now?

3390
02:18:18,570 --> 02:18:19,270
Just leave!

3391
02:18:32,690 --> 02:18:33,670
No, they're just sleeping!

3392
02:18:33,990 --> 02:18:34,190
You're gone!

3393
02:18:34,630 --> 02:18:35,070
Get it!

3394
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:35,490
Go on!

3395
02:18:35,690 --> 02:18:36,970
Sergeant always comes back!

3396
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:38,410
They won't get me!

3397
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:39,190
Oh god!

3398
02:18:39,430 --> 02:18:40,070
Oh god!

3399
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:41,470
I don't wanna be like them, please!

3400
02:18:41,810 --> 02:18:42,530
Please no!

3401
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:43,470
Please no!

3402
02:18:44,310 --> 02:18:44,910
Please no!

3403
02:18:50,490 --> 02:18:51,550
What the fuck?

3404
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:56,900
What the fuck?

3405
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:02,480
Are you okay?

3406
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:08,660
What the fuck?

3407
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:15,740
Alright...

3408
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:17,500
Alright, I was not joking!

3409
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,040
It had to be done!

3410
02:19:21,460 --> 02:19:23,380
Guys, he's just sleeping, I just...

3411
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:25,260
Oh, wait what?

3412
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:27,000
Oh, there's that chamber again!

3413
02:19:29,440 --> 02:19:31,720
Okay, something happened in this chamber!

3414
02:19:37,850 --> 02:19:39,410
Something happened there.

3415
02:19:40,210 --> 02:19:41,410
Alright, things are turning.

3416
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:45,470
Guys, there's no way Captain Keyes is a bad guy.

3417
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:47,550
He's the captain.

3418
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:52,170
Good soldiers follow orders, guys.

3419
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:53,790
There's no way.

3420
02:19:58,930 --> 02:20:01,430
He would never betray us like this.

3421
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:06,030
Hold on.

3422
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:09,430
She figured out the twin.

3423
02:20:09,710 --> 02:20:11,070
Okay, guys, that twin.

3424
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:14,210
The fact that Captain Keyes is a bad guy.

3425
02:20:14,610 --> 02:20:17,810
Cortana was like, we gotta stop Captain Keyes.

3426
02:20:18,010 --> 02:20:19,470
Yeah, no fucking shit.

3427
02:20:19,470 --> 02:20:20,650
He's a bad guy.

3428
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:28,560
What would what?

3429
02:20:33,340 --> 02:20:35,360
How did you know, Donkey?

3430
02:20:43,190 --> 02:20:44,450
God damn it.

3431
02:20:44,550 --> 02:20:47,210
I can't believe Cortana spoiled it for everybody.

3432
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:48,550
She is chat.

3433
02:21:02,580 --> 02:21:03,260
Oh?

3434
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:04,460
Oh, he's alive.

3435
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:09,360
He's just sleeping with his eyes open, right?

3436
02:21:25,550 --> 02:21:26,790
It's nappy time.

3437
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:34,420
Jenkins?

3438
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:37,760
What?

3439
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:45,740
Bill, thank you to the super chat.

3440
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:46,460
Thank you, thank you.

3441
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:48,180
Somehow Palpatine returned.

3442
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:53,120
Why do we always have to listen to this old stuff, Sarge?

3443
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:54,800
Watch your mouth, son.

3444
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:56,720
This stuff is your history.

3445
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:59,260
It should remind you grunts what we're fighting to protect.

3446
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:00,600
And see, he's back!

3447
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:05,800
If the Covenant wanna wipe out this particular part of my history, that's fine by me.

3448
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:08,400
Yeah, better it than us.

3449
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:12,020
You ask him real nice next time you see him, Vicente.

3450
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:14,480
I'm sure they'll be happy to oblige.

3451
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:16,540
LZ looks clear.

3452
02:22:21,470 --> 02:22:22,570
Go, go, go!

3453
02:22:24,890 --> 02:22:26,890
There is music, but it's super quiet.

3454
02:22:27,050 --> 02:22:30,770
But all the mixing, the audio is combined into one fucking setting.

3455
02:22:33,250 --> 02:22:34,350
Stay close, Jenkins!

3456
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:40,930
Mendoza, move it up!

3457
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:48,390
Wait here for the captain and his squad, then get your ass inside.

3458
02:22:49,130 --> 02:22:49,410
Sir!

3459
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:51,030
Sergeant Johnson, my king!

3460
02:22:51,550 --> 02:22:52,630
Thank you for the super chat!

3461
02:22:52,790 --> 02:22:53,650
Thank you, thank you!

3462
02:22:56,850 --> 02:22:57,290
Forward?

3463
02:22:57,870 --> 02:22:59,150
He's like, I'm bored now.

3464
02:22:59,150 --> 02:23:01,070
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3465
02:23:01,150 --> 02:23:02,150
Ha ha ha ha!

3466
02:23:02,150 --> 02:23:02,710
Ha ha ha ha!

3467
02:23:03,950 --> 02:23:05,190
Which is weird, right?

3468
02:23:05,570 --> 02:23:07,190
I mean, look at it!

3469
02:23:08,010 --> 02:23:08,650
What's that?

3470
02:23:09,010 --> 02:23:09,770
Scramble the insides?

3471
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:11,370
But it's like a chestburster.

3472
02:23:11,790 --> 02:23:12,190
What's that?

3473
02:23:12,370 --> 02:23:13,170
Plasma scoring?

3474
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:14,970
Yeah, I don't know.

3475
02:23:15,310 --> 02:23:16,670
Maybe there was an accident, you know?

3476
02:23:16,870 --> 02:23:17,270
Friendly fire...

3477
02:23:17,270 --> 02:23:18,030
ADHD.

3478
02:23:18,450 --> 02:23:19,670
Skip to the good part.

3479
02:23:19,910 --> 02:23:20,890
What do we have, Sergeant?

3480
02:23:21,510 --> 02:23:22,810
Looks like a Covenant patrol.

3481
02:23:23,290 --> 02:23:24,490
Badass elite units.

3482
02:23:24,670 --> 02:23:25,530
All KIA.

3483
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:27,190
Real pretty!

3484
02:23:28,030 --> 02:23:28,950
Friend of yours?

3485
02:23:29,650 --> 02:23:30,910
Now, we just met.

3486
02:23:37,030 --> 02:23:38,270
Ha ha ha ha!

3487
02:23:39,470 --> 02:23:40,290
Skip intro.

3488
02:23:40,610 --> 02:23:42,190
Right, well, let's get this door open.

3489
02:23:42,670 --> 02:23:43,690
I'll try, sir.

3490
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:46,230
But it looks like these Covenant work pretty hard to lock it down.

3491
02:23:46,770 --> 02:23:47,950
Just do it, son.

3492
02:23:48,570 --> 02:23:49,330
Yes, sir.

3493
02:23:52,390 --> 02:23:53,430
Skippa, skippa!

3494
02:23:58,550 --> 02:23:59,630
Was that easy?

3495
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:00,870
Holy shit!

3496
02:24:24,210 --> 02:24:26,290
I mean, why is it so empty?

3497
02:24:27,390 --> 02:24:28,430
What's going on, soldier?

3498
02:24:31,890 --> 02:24:32,410
Covenant?

3499
02:24:39,610 --> 02:24:40,610
What are they?

3500
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:44,170
I thought Halo was all about fighting the Covenant.

3501
02:24:44,170 --> 02:24:47,110
In the squad's position and find out what the hell is going on.

3502
02:24:47,290 --> 02:24:47,630
But...

3503
02:24:47,630 --> 02:24:49,090
I don't have time for your lift, soldier.

3504
02:24:49,390 --> 02:24:50,030
I gave you an order.

3505
02:24:51,070 --> 02:24:51,550
What?

3506
02:24:52,990 --> 02:24:54,450
Oh, it's the green stuff!

3507
02:24:55,350 --> 02:24:56,930
Where's that coming from, Mendoza?

3508
02:24:57,570 --> 02:24:58,110
I don't...

3509
02:24:58,110 --> 02:24:58,570
There!

3510
02:24:58,970 --> 02:24:59,450
Mira!

3511
02:25:00,010 --> 02:25:00,490
Mira?

3512
02:25:02,110 --> 02:25:03,410
The fuck is that?

3513
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:04,630
Yeah, that's the green stuff!

3514
02:25:04,850 --> 02:25:05,410
Hold still!

3515
02:25:05,610 --> 02:25:06,130
Hold still!

3516
02:25:06,610 --> 02:25:07,550
Let him have it!

3517
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:10,730
Oh my god, it's like aliens!

3518
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:14,710
Sergeant, we're surrounded!

3519
02:25:15,210 --> 02:25:15,970
Goddammit, Jenkins!

3520
02:25:16,230 --> 02:25:17,030
Fire your weapon!

3521
02:25:17,370 --> 02:25:18,490
There are too many, Sarge!

3522
02:25:18,490 --> 02:25:19,590
Don't even think about it!

3523
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:21,470
Who the fuck just brings only a...

3524
02:25:21,470 --> 02:25:22,350
Oh, it's Captain Keys.

3525
02:25:22,630 --> 02:25:22,790
Okay.

3526
02:25:23,490 --> 02:25:24,490
Oh, this is loco!

3527
02:25:26,690 --> 02:25:28,130
This is loco!

3528
02:25:28,130 --> 02:25:28,970
Oh!

3529
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:45,640
Wait, that's it?

3530
02:25:46,900 --> 02:25:48,560
The recording stops there?

3531
02:25:50,740 --> 02:25:51,600
The flood.

3532
02:25:53,340 --> 02:25:53,800
Oh?

3533
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:00,220
Hold on.

3534
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:02,900
Wouldn't it be funny if I just break that glass and we fall down?

3535
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:04,240
They just...

3536
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:04,800
Die?

3537
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:06,440
Oh, there's all their guns.

3538
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:08,140
Oh!

3539
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:08,980
Wait, there they are!

3540
02:26:16,330 --> 02:26:17,990
Okay, that is a lot of them.

3541
02:26:24,940 --> 02:26:25,500
Okay.

3542
02:26:29,300 --> 02:26:29,860
Okay.

3543
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:32,000
I'm just gonna charge this up, actually.

3544
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:33,680
It might actually be easier.

3545
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:36,680
Now, I can take them.

3546
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:38,000
They're not that many, anyway.

3547
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:38,960
Look at that.

3548
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:40,620
See?

3549
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:41,520
It's not that bad.

3550
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:42,380
Where did them go?

3551
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:43,560
Wait.

3552
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:49,040
Okay, I ran out of ammo.

3553
02:26:56,710 --> 02:26:57,750
Oh, shit!

3554
02:26:58,330 --> 02:26:59,170
Oh, shit!

3555
02:27:01,230 --> 02:27:01,790
Guys!

3556
02:27:02,090 --> 02:27:03,470
I can't take them!

3557
02:27:03,470 --> 02:27:04,510
I lied!

3558
02:27:06,630 --> 02:27:07,330
Ah!

3559
02:27:07,730 --> 02:27:08,130
Fuck!

3560
02:27:10,450 --> 02:27:11,150
Wait.

3561
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:12,110
Where's...

3562
02:27:12,110 --> 02:27:13,270
Okay, I need the AR.

3563
02:27:13,390 --> 02:27:14,250
I need the AR.

3564
02:27:14,850 --> 02:27:15,790
I need the...

3565
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:16,690
That's fine.

3566
02:27:19,230 --> 02:27:19,930
Okay.

3567
02:27:20,450 --> 02:27:21,630
That's a dead end.

3568
02:27:22,630 --> 02:27:24,210
That's a dead end.

3569
02:27:24,610 --> 02:27:26,230
Maybe this is not a dead end.

3570
02:27:26,230 --> 02:27:27,910
That's also a...

3571
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:29,790
Where the fuck do I go?

3572
02:27:30,830 --> 02:27:32,050
Where the fuck do I go?

3573
02:27:33,070 --> 02:27:33,490
Okay.

3574
02:27:34,990 --> 02:27:36,110
Let's see.

3575
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:41,860
Oh my god.

3576
02:27:43,700 --> 02:27:44,380
It's fine.

3577
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:49,820
Fuck this.

3578
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:53,120
Wait.

3579
02:27:53,220 --> 02:27:54,160
I can take this, actually.

3580
02:27:54,360 --> 02:27:54,700
Wait a minute.

3581
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:54,920
Wait.

3582
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:55,280
This works.

3583
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:57,120
I can take this.

3584
02:27:57,220 --> 02:27:57,700
Look at that.

3585
02:27:58,200 --> 02:27:58,440
See?

3586
02:28:00,220 --> 02:28:00,620
Boom.

3587
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:03,740
Boom.

3588
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:04,720
Oh, shit.

3589
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:05,100
Never...

3590
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:05,600
Boom.

3591
02:28:07,260 --> 02:28:07,800
There you go.

3592
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:09,140
That's so bad, actually.

3593
02:28:17,560 --> 02:28:20,520
There you go.

3594
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:21,120
There you go.

3595
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:22,800
Let me just...

3596
02:28:24,420 --> 02:28:25,760
Let me just do that, actually.

3597
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:27,280
See?

3598
02:28:32,190 --> 02:28:32,650
Okay.

3599
02:28:32,730 --> 02:28:34,610
How the fuck did my team die to this?

3600
02:28:34,690 --> 02:28:36,070
It's literally one melee hit.

3601
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:36,530
Oh, wait.

3602
02:28:36,550 --> 02:28:37,290
I'm a super soldier.

3603
02:28:37,750 --> 02:28:38,150
Nevermind.

3604
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:39,050
I forgot.

3605
02:28:39,330 --> 02:28:40,150
They're just...

3606
02:28:40,150 --> 02:28:41,010
Regular people.

3607
02:28:42,470 --> 02:28:43,470
Look at that.

3608
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:45,170
It's like popping a balloon.

3609
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:48,170
That's so easy.

3610
02:28:51,580 --> 02:28:53,360
Just popping a little balloon.

3611
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:55,120
Nobody said not...

3612
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:56,480
Nobody told them to...

3613
02:28:56,480 --> 02:28:57,540
What the fuck?

3614
02:28:57,660 --> 02:28:59,700
They all just like ambushed me.

3615
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:00,460
They're like, yes.

3616
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:02,240
She'll eventually come inside.

3617
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:05,660
Oh, I don't like that.

3618
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:07,980
Oh my god.

3619
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:12,580
What the fuck?

3620
02:29:14,220 --> 02:29:14,700
Wait.

3621
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:15,820
Oh, shit!

3622
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:16,580
Is that them?

3623
02:29:18,060 --> 02:29:19,160
Is that my team?

3624
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:22,720
Okay.

3625
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:23,560
I think they're dead.

3626
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:26,920
Alright.

3627
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:27,160
Okay.

3628
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:28,420
They're not that strong.

3629
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:28,900
Thank god.

3630
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:31,200
I think that was them.

3631
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:32,780
I think that was the squad.

3632
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:35,980
Holy shit.

3633
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:37,980
So, okay.

3634
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:40,160
Oh, okay.

3635
02:29:40,300 --> 02:29:41,080
They just smacked me.

3636
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:43,840
Yeah.

3637
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:44,920
I'm pretty sure that was them.

3638
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:50,620
Oh, no.

3639
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,280
Where do I go?

3640
02:29:53,580 --> 02:29:54,380
Oh, no.

3641
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:56,300
Oh, no.

3642
02:29:56,420 --> 02:29:57,720
They don't carry nades.

3643
02:29:58,660 --> 02:29:59,940
Oh, my god!

3644
02:30:05,430 --> 02:30:06,110
Oh, god.

3645
02:30:06,370 --> 02:30:06,890
Oh, god.

3646
02:30:07,470 --> 02:30:09,330
Oh, why did I use up all my nades?

3647
02:30:10,210 --> 02:30:10,650
Oh!

3648
02:30:11,530 --> 02:30:11,970
Oh!

3649
02:30:12,530 --> 02:30:13,230
They're so...

3650
02:30:13,230 --> 02:30:13,530
Oh, wait.

3651
02:30:13,630 --> 02:30:13,770
Nice.

3652
02:30:14,130 --> 02:30:14,970
They do carry nades.

3653
02:30:18,510 --> 02:30:18,950
Okay.

3654
02:30:20,930 --> 02:30:21,590
Oh, god.

3655
02:30:23,430 --> 02:30:24,550
These guys are dangerous.

3656
02:30:24,910 --> 02:30:26,290
These guys are so dangerous.

3657
02:30:26,530 --> 02:30:27,890
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

3658
02:30:28,130 --> 02:30:30,270
How is there so many of them?!

3659
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:33,430
Oh.

3660
02:30:37,050 --> 02:30:37,430
Oh.

3661
02:30:37,470 --> 02:30:38,290
Oh, I don't know where to go.

3662
02:30:40,710 --> 02:30:41,090
Oh.

3663
02:30:41,290 --> 02:30:42,330
I don't know where to go.

3664
02:30:42,410 --> 02:30:44,530
I just saw them all fucking bunched up.

3665
02:30:44,610 --> 02:30:46,110
So, I assume it's the right direction!

3666
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,360
What the fuck?

3667
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:57,440
Oh, it's right here.

3668
02:30:57,820 --> 02:30:58,540
It's right here.

3669
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:02,660
I thought I went the right way because there were so many bodies there.

3670
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:05,280
Oh.

3671
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:07,020
Did I just leave?

3672
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:08,460
I think I'm just supposed to leave.

3673
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:11,340
Oh, my god.

3674
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:12,220
He just smashed me!

3675
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:12,720
Oh!

3676
02:31:14,380 --> 02:31:15,880
Oh, my god!

3677
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:16,400
Fuck!

3678
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:20,160
Okay.

3679
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:22,560
Okay, they die faster with pistol.

3680
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:23,140
Okay.

3681
02:31:23,980 --> 02:31:24,920
That's good to know.

3682
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:28,240
That's good to know.

3683
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:33,120
It's okay.

3684
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:33,780
I found it.

3685
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:34,860
Okay.

3686
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:35,400
There you go.

3687
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:38,400
I think I'm going the right way.

3688
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:38,980
I don't know.

3689
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:39,820
I don't know.

3690
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:40,540
I'm a little lost.

3691
02:31:54,740 --> 02:31:56,260
You got this, Covenant!

3692
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:01,440
You guys got this!

3693
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:03,520
I believe in you!

3694
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:06,640
I'm trying to...

3695
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:07,740
Guys, where...

3696
02:32:07,740 --> 02:32:08,620
Where am I?

3697
02:32:10,020 --> 02:32:11,860
Please, SHUT THEM!

3698
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:19,530
Where's this door?

3699
02:32:19,930 --> 02:32:20,470
Where...

3700
02:32:20,470 --> 02:32:22,210
Where are the doors?

3701
02:32:25,050 --> 02:32:26,990
I feel like I've been going around!

3702
02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:28,110
And around!

3703
02:32:31,420 --> 02:32:31,850
Oh, my god.

3704
02:32:31,910 --> 02:32:32,430
There's the craze.

3705
02:32:32,550 --> 02:32:33,230
Okay, there it is.

3706
02:32:38,860 --> 02:32:39,220
Okay.

3707
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:41,060
Oh, my god.

3708
02:32:41,140 --> 02:32:41,840
I can't get up from that.

3709
02:32:42,300 --> 02:32:44,080
These crates do not let me go up.

3710
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:45,960
Okay, I came from here.

3711
02:32:48,580 --> 02:32:49,460
Is this crate?

3712
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:51,460
Oh, my god.

3713
02:32:51,540 --> 02:32:51,960
It's this way.

3714
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:56,780
Hey, guys.

3715
02:32:57,500 --> 02:32:58,820
Thanks for saving me back there.

3716
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:01,740
But...

3717
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:02,680
I need to get...

3718
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:03,640
I need to get out of here.

3719
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:04,600
Sorry, buddy.

3720
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:09,660
But I need to get out of here.

3721
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:12,460
Alright.

3722
02:33:16,090 --> 02:33:17,430
Thank you for the super chat.

3723
02:33:17,550 --> 02:33:17,750
Thank you.

3724
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:18,510
Thank you!

3725
02:33:20,970 --> 02:33:21,810
Oh, I should've...

3726
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:22,330
Oh, it's okay.

3727
02:33:22,610 --> 02:33:23,470
I need the app.

3728
02:33:23,590 --> 02:33:23,930
It's fine.

3729
02:33:25,290 --> 02:33:26,530
I'll use this for now.

3730
02:33:27,070 --> 02:33:28,430
If I kill more...

3731
02:33:28,430 --> 02:33:29,450
More of the covenant.

3732
02:33:29,830 --> 02:33:30,930
I'll grab the...

3733
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:31,790
Plasma gun.

3734
02:33:33,490 --> 02:33:34,370
Oh, I hear them.

3735
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:34,830
Oh!

3736
02:33:37,170 --> 02:33:38,010
Oh, I knew it.

3737
02:33:38,410 --> 02:33:38,550
Oh!

3738
02:33:38,750 --> 02:33:39,310
My flashlight!

3739
02:33:39,910 --> 02:33:40,810
Oh, I knew it!

3740
02:33:43,230 --> 02:33:43,870
Where's your gun?

3741
02:33:43,950 --> 02:33:44,390
Where's your gun?

3742
02:33:44,470 --> 02:33:44,930
Where's your gun?

3743
02:33:45,650 --> 02:33:46,310
Oh, my god!

3744
02:33:46,410 --> 02:33:47,370
What the fuck did you do?

3745
02:33:47,470 --> 02:33:48,930
Did you fucking eat their guns?

3746
02:33:58,270 --> 02:33:59,470
Oh, my god.

3747
02:33:59,930 --> 02:34:01,150
Oh, my god.

3748
02:34:01,210 --> 02:34:03,990
Oh, my god.

3749
02:34:10,270 --> 02:34:10,910
Oh, my...

3750
02:34:10,910 --> 02:34:11,230
Okay.

3751
02:34:12,970 --> 02:34:13,910
What the fuck?

3752
02:34:14,070 --> 02:34:15,330
What the fuck they have guns?!

3753
02:34:19,550 --> 02:34:21,170
What the fuck?!

3754
02:34:21,170 --> 02:34:23,110
Oh, they can just...

3755
02:34:23,110 --> 02:34:23,430
God!

3756
02:34:25,470 --> 02:34:26,630
Holy shit!

3757
02:34:29,210 --> 02:34:30,510
Oh, my god!

3758
02:34:32,870 --> 02:34:35,590
Who the fuck gave them guns?!

3759
02:34:36,540 --> 02:34:37,210
Oh, my god!

3760
02:34:37,330 --> 02:34:37,790
My HP!

3761
02:34:38,110 --> 02:34:39,090
My HP!

3762
02:34:40,650 --> 02:34:42,250
Oh, my god!

3763
02:34:42,510 --> 02:34:43,210
My HP!

3764
02:34:43,530 --> 02:34:44,940
My poor HP!

3765
02:34:48,350 --> 02:34:51,230
I didn't expect them to have guns!

3766
02:34:57,180 --> 02:34:58,380
Holy shit!

3767
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:00,980
Holy shit!

3768
02:35:07,230 --> 02:35:08,090
God!

3769
02:35:14,420 --> 02:35:16,340
Oh, he's just chillin'.

3770
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:18,920
He's just chillin' over there.

3771
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:22,960
Oh, my god.

3772
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:23,260
Please.

3773
02:35:24,980 --> 02:35:26,900
Please, I need your plasma gun.

3774
02:35:29,900 --> 02:35:30,480
Okay.

3775
02:35:31,640 --> 02:35:32,740
Wait, there's a shotgun?!

3776
02:35:32,740 --> 02:35:33,840
Where's the shotgun?!

3777
02:35:34,440 --> 02:35:35,380
Oh, my god!

3778
02:35:35,460 --> 02:35:35,980
There it is!

3779
02:35:37,460 --> 02:35:38,540
Oh, thank god!

3780
02:35:39,020 --> 02:35:39,460
Alright.

3781
02:35:46,170 --> 02:35:46,750
Okay.

3782
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:51,580
Oh, my god.

3783
02:35:51,820 --> 02:35:53,400
I can't believe they have guns now.

3784
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:57,700
Who the fuck taught these zombies how to fucking shoot their guns?!

3785
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:00,440
Oh, thank god.

3786
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:04,480
Oh, no.

3787
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:06,840
Oh, no.

3788
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:09,360
Okay.

3789
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:10,560
We're okay.

3790
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:11,540
We got to there.

3791
02:36:13,580 --> 02:36:16,340
A zombie is supposed to have no brain development!

3792
02:36:20,180 --> 02:36:20,780
Alright.

3793
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:22,040
We're okay.

3794
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:25,160
Okay.

3795
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:26,140
We're fine.

3796
02:36:28,980 --> 02:36:30,020
We don't know how to jump.

3797
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:33,840
Oh, no.

3798
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:35,900
I think it's this way.

3799
02:36:36,760 --> 02:36:38,200
Oh, I think it's...

3800
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:39,420
Get out of here!

3801
02:36:40,860 --> 02:36:41,800
That's right!

3802
02:36:42,460 --> 02:36:43,900
Cat chest versus me!

3803
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:47,500
Oh, my god.

3804
02:36:47,720 --> 02:36:48,920
Oh, my god.

3805
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:50,260
That's right!

3806
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:51,120
I have armor!

3807
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:53,460
What you gonna do about that, bitch?!

3808
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,280
I'm so lost.

3809
02:36:58,540 --> 02:36:59,980
I'm so lost!

3810
02:37:00,260 --> 02:37:01,260
It's down here.

3811
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:04,460
Oh, my god.

3812
02:37:04,700 --> 02:37:05,180
It's fine.

3813
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:06,260
It's fine.

3814
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:08,780
It's not fine.

3815
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:10,780
It's not fine.

3816
02:37:13,020 --> 02:37:13,720
It's fine.

3817
02:37:14,420 --> 02:37:14,560
It's fine.

3818
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:15,520
Oh, it's not fine.

3819
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:18,220
It's...

3820
02:37:26,140 --> 02:37:27,060
Holy shit!

3821
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:32,340
Oh, I'm dead.

3822
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:34,080
I'm so not healthy right now.

3823
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:35,600
I am not healthy at all.

3824
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:37,040
It's fine.

3825
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:37,980
Everything is fine.

3826
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:40,620
Everything is so fine.

3827
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:43,240
Okay.

3828
02:37:45,980 --> 02:37:48,380
Okay, the most bullshit part is that I can't steal their guns.

3829
02:37:48,380 --> 02:37:49,680
I think that's the bullshit.

3830
02:37:49,960 --> 02:37:50,940
I know you're behind me.

3831
02:37:51,080 --> 02:37:51,680
I knew it.

3832
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:53,560
I fucking knew it.

3833
02:37:53,740 --> 02:37:54,460
I have ears.

3834
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:57,660
I knew it.

3835
02:37:57,780 --> 02:37:58,580
I still have ears.

3836
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:03,520
God, I don't know if I should take that.

3837
02:38:10,210 --> 02:38:11,990
Jesus, it takes so many shots.

3838
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:18,960
Where do I go from here?

3839
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:19,640
Okay, it's up top.

3840
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:24,240
It's up top.

3841
02:38:24,860 --> 02:38:25,720
How do I get up top?

3842
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:28,060
Oh my God, it's up top.

3843
02:38:28,380 --> 02:38:29,380
How do I get up top?

3844
02:38:29,540 --> 02:38:30,060
Oh, there it is.

3845
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:30,880
Okay.

3846
02:38:35,010 --> 02:38:35,370
Okay.

3847
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:37,470
Snake, thank you for the super chat.

3848
02:38:37,610 --> 02:38:37,830
Thank you.

3849
02:38:38,010 --> 02:38:38,590
Thank you.

3850
02:38:39,330 --> 02:38:41,870
Most importantly, they are bottom eaters.

3851
02:38:46,350 --> 02:38:48,010
Thank God the shotgun's one shot.

3852
02:38:56,610 --> 02:38:57,310
It's okay.

3853
02:38:58,010 --> 02:38:58,550
It's okay.

3854
02:38:58,550 --> 02:38:59,410
I just gotta get to the other side.

3855
02:38:59,670 --> 02:39:00,950
And then we should be good.

3856
02:39:01,290 --> 02:39:03,810
I thought there would be an elevator there.

3857
02:39:04,110 --> 02:39:04,910
My bad.

3858
02:39:08,850 --> 02:39:11,270
Guess I should not have dropped out.

3859
02:39:13,230 --> 02:39:14,570
Oh my God.

3860
02:39:14,810 --> 02:39:15,810
How do I get back up top?

3861
02:39:25,610 --> 02:39:27,430
Oh my God.

3862
02:39:27,610 --> 02:39:27,710
Oh my God.

3863
02:39:27,710 --> 02:39:29,550
Do I have to do this all over again?

3864
02:39:29,950 --> 02:39:32,590
Oh my God.

3865
02:39:39,550 --> 02:39:42,850
I thought dropping down was the answer.

3866
02:39:43,810 --> 02:39:45,210
Okay, here we go again.

3867
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:48,810
It's okay.

3868
02:39:48,970 --> 02:39:50,370
I figured it out this time.

3869
02:39:51,390 --> 02:39:52,910
Okay, we can do this again.

3870
02:39:54,070 --> 02:39:55,810
I wanna get to the other side.

3871
02:39:57,730 --> 02:39:58,590
What the fuck?

3872
02:39:58,830 --> 02:40:00,450
How do I get to the other side?

3873
02:40:01,130 --> 02:40:02,070
What the fuck?

3874
02:40:02,190 --> 02:40:02,490
Oh wait.

3875
02:40:02,830 --> 02:40:03,610
There's a button.

3876
02:40:04,250 --> 02:40:05,750
I keep forgetting these are buttons.

3877
02:40:07,230 --> 02:40:07,790
There we go.

3878
02:40:09,490 --> 02:40:11,170
I don't know why I keep forgetting that.

3879
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:15,670
There we go.

3880
02:40:20,050 --> 02:40:21,850
Alright, eventually, like...

3881
02:40:23,490 --> 02:40:24,790
It'll stop, right?

3882
02:40:27,150 --> 02:40:29,410
Eventually, the horde will stop, right?

3883
02:40:30,070 --> 02:40:30,770
Oh my God.

3884
02:40:30,850 --> 02:40:31,630
There's the other elevator.

3885
02:40:32,490 --> 02:40:33,450
Oh, thank God.

3886
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:34,470
Please go up.

3887
02:40:35,310 --> 02:40:35,850
Please.

3888
02:40:36,130 --> 02:40:37,470
Oh, thank God it goes up.

3889
02:40:41,690 --> 02:40:43,170
I can't believe it.

3890
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:45,310
When did this game became a zombie game?

3891
02:40:47,630 --> 02:40:48,930
Where's Captain Keys?

3892
02:40:51,590 --> 02:40:52,330
It's me.

3893
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:05,730
Don't worry, men.

3894
02:41:10,650 --> 02:41:12,830
I'll never forget your first blood.

3895
02:41:13,050 --> 02:41:15,130
I thought it was just Halo and Covenant.

3896
02:41:15,490 --> 02:41:18,190
Why have I never heard about fucking zombies?

3897
02:41:18,630 --> 02:41:20,070
In my Halo game?

3898
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:21,610
I've never heard...

3899
02:41:22,730 --> 02:41:26,570
It's like the most well-kept secret for like all beginners.

3900
02:41:26,990 --> 02:41:29,450
I swear, I've never heard about the zombies.

3901
02:41:30,910 --> 02:41:31,750
In Halo.

3902
02:41:31,750 --> 02:41:33,090
They gave us a super chat.

3903
02:41:33,230 --> 02:41:35,230
This is literally the first time I've ever...

3904
02:41:35,230 --> 02:41:36,150
WOOOOO!

3905
02:41:36,410 --> 02:41:36,970
I'm on.

3906
02:41:41,990 --> 02:41:42,870
Oh no.

3907
02:41:46,940 --> 02:41:47,500
Spy.

3908
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:48,820
Go forward!

3909
02:41:49,620 --> 02:41:50,820
You guys got this!

3910
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:51,760
Just go forward!

3911
02:41:56,770 --> 02:41:58,530
Just keep going forward!

3912
02:42:03,810 --> 02:42:04,170
Alright.

3913
02:42:06,550 --> 02:42:07,630
Come on Marines!

3914
02:42:09,410 --> 02:42:10,970
Okay, you're just shooting at each other.

3915
02:42:11,270 --> 02:42:11,470
What?

3916
02:42:12,070 --> 02:42:14,730
Like, what are you guys shoot- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3917
02:42:14,810 --> 02:42:15,730
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

3918
02:42:15,810 --> 02:42:16,630
That's what you're shooting at.

3919
02:42:16,710 --> 02:42:19,570
I was gonna say, like, what the fuck are you guys shooting at?

3920
02:42:20,950 --> 02:42:22,210
Oh, there's a lot.

3921
02:42:22,770 --> 02:42:24,010
There's a lot of them.

3922
02:42:24,370 --> 02:42:25,810
Guys, stop shooting me!

3923
02:42:29,210 --> 02:42:29,690
Stop!

3924
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:34,800
Guys!

3925
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:37,640
Oh my god, they're all dead.

3926
02:42:38,180 --> 02:42:39,100
They're all dead.

3927
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:40,740
Oh my god.

3928
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:42,540
Oh my god, they're all dead.

3929
02:42:42,980 --> 02:42:43,160
Okay.

3930
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:44,380
That's on them.

3931
02:42:44,500 --> 02:42:44,920
That's on them.

3932
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:47,520
I did everything I could to save my team.

3933
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:49,720
I actually did everything I could.

3934
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:50,800
That's on them.

3935
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:52,000
That's not me.

3936
02:42:57,480 --> 02:42:58,900
It's not my fault.

3937
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:00,940
I shot my shots.

3938
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:05,700
What's this?

3939
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:11,510
Hey, I hear gunshots.

3940
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:17,360
Wait, what?

3941
02:43:17,540 --> 02:43:18,040
Oh, hey.

3942
02:43:18,900 --> 02:43:19,500
Friends.

3943
02:43:31,850 --> 02:43:32,690
Friends.

3944
02:43:33,690 --> 02:43:34,390
Nice.

3945
02:43:36,530 --> 02:43:38,890
Okay, these guys are better than the fucking marine.

3946
02:43:39,050 --> 02:43:39,390
Oh!

3947
02:43:41,770 --> 02:43:42,370
No!

3948
02:43:46,770 --> 02:43:47,370
Okay.

3949
02:43:49,690 --> 02:43:50,970
We just stay here?

3950
02:43:57,340 --> 02:43:59,880
Yeah, who needs humans when you have robot friends?

3951
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:01,640
Oh, there we go.

3952
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:02,940
Yay!

3953
02:44:03,620 --> 02:44:03,920
Wait!

3954
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:05,800
Bob Halo?

3955
02:44:07,440 --> 02:44:08,400
Or is that me?

3956
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:10,240
I am 343 guilty spark.

3957
02:44:10,460 --> 02:44:11,660
Oh, 343!

3958
02:44:11,900 --> 02:44:12,560
Oh, that's me!

3959
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:13,120
Someone has released the phone.

3960
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:13,760
That was just darker.

3961
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:17,300
My function is to prevent it from leaving this installation.

3962
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:19,480
But I require your assistance.

3963
02:44:20,440 --> 02:44:20,560
Come.

3964
02:44:20,860 --> 02:44:21,440
This way.

3965
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:25,400
Don de esta la biblioteca.

3966
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:28,960
It's very loco.

3967
02:44:29,620 --> 02:44:29,640
Chief!

3968
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:29,840
Chief!

3969
02:44:44,020 --> 02:44:44,900
The library.

3970
02:44:48,950 --> 02:44:50,350
Time for the filter.

3971
02:45:00,590 --> 02:45:01,110
The library.

3972
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:02,390
Wait, they can come back to life?

3973
02:45:04,170 --> 02:45:05,210
What do you mean?

3974
02:45:08,070 --> 02:45:09,110
What do you mean?

3975
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:12,450
We must come up the index before we can activate the installation.

3976
02:45:13,790 --> 02:45:14,090
What?

3977
02:45:17,070 --> 02:45:18,390
What do you mean, guys?

3978
02:45:18,690 --> 02:45:19,510
No, no.

3979
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:20,750
It's dead.

3980
02:45:21,090 --> 02:45:21,470
It's dead.

3981
02:45:21,710 --> 02:45:23,130
You're just seeing things, guys.

3982
02:45:23,870 --> 02:45:24,450
It's dead.

3983
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:25,510
They're all dead.

3984
02:45:25,850 --> 02:45:31,370
They're all dead.

3985
02:45:33,250 --> 02:45:36,430
Wait, why is that?

3986
02:45:37,230 --> 02:45:37,830
Wait.

3987
02:45:38,090 --> 02:45:38,710
Wait a minute.

3988
02:45:39,130 --> 02:45:39,950
Wait a minute.

3989
02:45:40,710 --> 02:45:42,030
Guys, I think I'm gonna...

3990
02:45:59,270 --> 02:46:00,470
You know what?

3991
02:46:00,550 --> 02:46:02,210
I think it's a good stopping point.

3992
02:46:04,230 --> 02:46:06,670
Guys, it's not that I'm getting filtered.

3993
02:46:06,950 --> 02:46:07,230
Tomorrow.

3994
02:46:07,610 --> 02:46:08,330
It's just...

3995
02:46:08,330 --> 02:46:10,210
I need to record something tonight.

3996
02:46:10,210 --> 02:46:10,490
Okay.

3997
02:46:10,490 --> 02:46:12,190
I need to make sure my voice is okay.

3998
02:46:12,550 --> 02:46:12,990
Guys.

3999
02:46:15,310 --> 02:46:16,070
We'll let...

4000
02:46:16,070 --> 02:46:18,410
We'll let future Doki finish Halo.

4001
02:46:19,070 --> 02:46:20,250
Until, like, next week.

4002
02:46:20,550 --> 02:46:23,210
Welcome to the worst level ever made.

4003
02:46:24,310 --> 02:46:26,430
Thank you for the super chat.

4004
02:46:26,590 --> 02:46:27,070
Broken file.

4005
02:46:27,210 --> 02:46:27,850
Thank you, thank you.

4006
02:46:28,150 --> 02:46:29,470
Snake, thank you for the super chat.

4007
02:46:29,550 --> 02:46:30,150
Thank you, thank you.

4008
02:46:30,330 --> 02:46:34,310
Moz, let's get a clip compilation of Doki's rage quit next stream.

4009
02:46:34,690 --> 02:46:35,430
Thank you for the super chat.

4010
02:46:35,430 --> 02:46:36,050
Thank you, thank you.

4011
02:46:36,090 --> 02:46:37,450
Anyways, welcome to the tomato file.

4012
02:46:37,690 --> 02:46:37,970
Welcome, welcome.

4013
02:46:38,110 --> 02:46:38,370
You know what?

4014
02:46:38,630 --> 02:46:39,610
Yeah, we'll just...

4015
02:46:39,610 --> 02:46:42,410
We'll let future Doki handle this.

4016
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:44,010
Anyways.

4017
02:46:44,930 --> 02:46:45,890
That was fun though.

4018
02:46:46,190 --> 02:46:48,350
I'm having a fun time with my first Halo game.

4019
02:46:48,490 --> 02:46:48,890
That's crazy.

4020
02:46:48,890 --> 02:46:52,130
I did not expect zombies to be like...

4021
02:46:52,130 --> 02:46:56,010
I feel like I've never seen anyone ever talk about the flood at all.

4022
02:46:56,250 --> 02:46:58,090
Like, whenever I've seen people mention Halo.

4023
02:46:58,310 --> 02:47:01,410
It's always Halo and the Covenant aliens.

4024
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:04,510
I swear I've never seen anything about the aliens ever before.

4025
02:47:07,530 --> 02:47:11,270
So, it's actually like my first time like experiencing that.

4026
02:47:11,510 --> 02:47:12,970
So, it's very interesting.

4027
02:47:13,150 --> 02:47:14,090
I'm very surprised.

4028
02:47:14,390 --> 02:47:16,210
It's like such a well-kept secret.

4029
02:47:16,530 --> 02:47:19,310
And like nobody has like spoiled it to like anybody.

4030
02:47:19,570 --> 02:47:22,590
Like no one has really spoiled that part for like people who have like...

4031
02:47:22,590 --> 02:47:27,230
Like, I guess like baby like surface level knowledge of Halo.

4032
02:47:28,150 --> 02:47:31,010
And like even when I watch like you know Halo speedruns.

4033
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:33,230
I feel like I never like registered that like...

4034
02:47:33,850 --> 02:47:37,190
Because you know like in the SDGD, QD, BC, AD.

4035
02:47:37,590 --> 02:47:39,410
They'll have like Halo speedruns and stuff.

4036
02:47:39,550 --> 02:47:42,630
And I feel like I've never seen anything about the flood.

4037
02:47:42,630 --> 02:47:45,750
I've always seen stuff about the Covenant and like wood, wood, wood.

4038
02:47:45,950 --> 02:47:50,450
But I feel like I've never seen anything about like the flood and like the aliens and stuff.

4039
02:47:50,590 --> 02:47:52,450
Like the zombie shit.

4040
02:47:53,210 --> 02:47:53,230
.

4041
02:47:57,830 --> 02:47:59,490
Jakchano, thank you the Superchat, thank you, thank you, thank you.

4042
02:47:59,630 --> 02:48:00,450
The ultimate cliffhanger.

4043
02:48:01,430 --> 02:48:04,270
Future Doki's gonna be angry with you when you're going to have to explain your...

4044
02:48:05,450 --> 02:48:06,410
Blame past Doki.

4045
02:48:06,630 --> 02:48:06,950
But, yeah.

4046
02:48:07,050 --> 02:48:07,510
This was fun.

4047
02:48:07,570 --> 02:48:07,670
Yeah.

4048
02:48:07,750 --> 02:48:08,870
I've been having a fun time.

4049
02:48:09,390 --> 02:48:11,430
Uh, next week, you wha superchat, thank you, thank you.

4050
02:48:11,630 --> 02:48:12,950
Glad you made it to the flood.

4051
02:48:13,470 --> 02:48:13,750
Unspoiled.

4052
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:15,230
There's a lot of fun stuff to come.

4053
02:48:15,330 --> 02:48:16,810
Thank you próprio superchat, thank you, thank you.

4054
02:48:17,070 --> 02:48:19,210
Sir Lauren, thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

4055
02:48:19,490 --> 02:48:20,290
Alright, I'll stop here.

4056
02:48:20,290 --> 02:48:23,750
Literally, how little me would react to reaching these levels in the campaign.

4057
02:48:23,870 --> 02:48:26,850
I just play the early levels over and over.

4058
02:48:27,010 --> 02:48:34,330
Wait, no, it's the library that... What makes... Okay, wait, no, don't tell me.

4059
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:38,850
I will find out what makes the library such a bad level.

4060
02:48:39,270 --> 02:48:40,590
Such a fucked up level.

4061
02:48:41,030 --> 02:48:44,630
Future Turkey will find out together with chat.

4062
02:48:47,010 --> 02:48:51,210
My next stream... The next stream will be like, the library level.

4063
02:48:52,150 --> 02:48:52,770
Hey, guys.

4064
02:48:54,630 --> 02:48:56,450
I'm going to go head off now.

4065
02:48:56,650 --> 02:48:58,210
I have some stuff I need to record.

4066
02:48:59,210 --> 02:49:05,610
And I wish I could do a little extra Zatsudon Super Chat reading after this.

4067
02:49:05,790 --> 02:49:13,950
But starting after my birthday next week, we're bringing back the Super Chat reading and post-game Zatsudons.

4068
02:49:14,510 --> 02:49:18,070
Because I'll be a lot less busy after that.

4069
02:49:18,930 --> 02:49:19,770
But anyway, guys.

4070
02:49:19,970 --> 02:49:20,890
As always, everybody.

4071
02:49:21,070 --> 02:49:21,970
Stay hydrated.

4072
02:49:22,330 --> 02:49:22,910
Posture check.

4073
02:49:23,130 --> 02:49:25,030
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4074
02:49:25,230 --> 02:49:27,050
But if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4075
02:49:27,070 --> 02:49:28,410
Because you deserve it.

4076
02:49:28,530 --> 02:49:29,890
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4077
02:49:30,450 --> 02:49:31,310
Bye, guys.

4078
02:49:31,650 --> 02:49:32,050
Bye.

4079
02:49:32,050 --> 02:49:32,790
Bye.
