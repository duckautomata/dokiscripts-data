1
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,420
Easy.

2
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,160
None.

3
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,000
Hello everybody!

4
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,540
Hello!

5
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,000
Hello!

6
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,220
Welcome to Pokemon Smash or Pass.

7
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,080
I got myself two experts on the smashability...

8
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,460
Okay.

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,980
...of random characters.

10
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,200
I mean, I know you two have done a lot of Smash or Pass lists, right?

11
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,020
I've seen Bao done a couple of ones in her day.

12
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,500
And Snuffy, you definitely have done a couple of ones.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,140
I've been cooking the next one for Monster Hunter Wild.

14
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,520
You caught me.

15
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,040
So, you can see on my stream, Bao and Snuffy are on the opposite side of me.

16
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,600
So, it's more like, you know, if I pass on something...

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,720
And if they smash, I need them to convince me why.

18
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,400
Why it's smashable.

19
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,080
You're just not seeing the vision.

20
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,840
Well, if you convince me, maybe I will see the vision.

21
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,360
This is such a great one to start chat.

22
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,020
Look at this.

23
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,460
I like that we're here to, like, brainwash her.

24
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,180
So, this is all randomized Pokemon.

25
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,420
So, it could be any one of them.

26
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,060
I don't know how long we're gonna go, honestly, until, I guess, until I start smashing all of them.

27
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,940
Until I just give up and be like, smash, smash, smash.

28
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,920
We gotta find her sleeper agent code for when she'll just start being like, suddenly, I think I'm gonna smash the ball.

29
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,040
I really wanna know what kind of Pokemon would, like, get you to smash without our help.

30
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,400
Wait, I get it now.

31
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,580
I see the vision.

32
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,140
Something will just click and you'll be like, it all makes sense.

33
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,020
Oh my god, everything just clicks.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,240
She's gonna walk out of here like a different person.

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,260
They need one of those whole, like, free-to-use brain expansion, like, medical...

36
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,100
You see the pulsing, the brain, when you're like, whoa.

37
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,460
Oh my god.

38
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,840
Right here, you can see when she starts...

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,660
I get it now.

40
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,480
When she starts to understand.

41
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Brain blast.

42
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,940
Brain blast.

43
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,000
Her neurons be firing and stuff.

44
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
Maybe we'll know.

45
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,900
We'll get, like, a feeling.

46
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,320
We'll have to, like, pull it out of her.

47
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,200
Alright, okay.

48
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,320
Alright, so...

49
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,340
What's how you pronounce it?

50
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,000
Sogalio?

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,640
Sogalio?

52
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,400
The lion, the god Pokemon from Pokemon Moon?

53
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,240
And Sun?

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,920
That was a 50-50?

55
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,120
Pokemon Sun.

56
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,320
I mean, like...

57
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,280
We looked up the height of him.

58
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,700
And it was, like, what?

59
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,980
Not that height matters, chat.

60
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,240
Not that height matters.

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,780
I mean, what if it's tiny?

62
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,700
Like, how do you...

63
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,200
It can vary, you know?

64
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,460
So, 11 feet?

65
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,960
On average?

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,020
11 feet.

67
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,180
That's, like, taller than the actual lion, right?

68
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,120
He weighs 500 pounds.

69
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,780
Holy fuck.

70
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,700
The average height of a lion.

71
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,400
The average height of a lion.

72
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,040
The average height of a lion is actually 3 feet tall.

73
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,600
Oh, so he's, like, 2 lions then.

74
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,660
Wait, but he's not, like, steel-type.

75
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,680
Yeah, I was like, wait a minute.

76
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,580
He's 11 feet, so...

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,800
Sorry, my map's not working, so he's, like, 3 to 4 lions tall.

78
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,800
3 to 4 lions tall?

79
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,260
Is he?

80
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,960
I thought he was 3 feet tall.

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,960
No, he's...

82
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,800
No, he's 3 meters.

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:39,940
Oh!

84
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,160
Aware.

85
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,400
I was like, that's a fucking tiny lion if he's only...

86
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,800
Yeah, I was gonna say, that's, like...

87
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,580
Okay, well...

88
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,180
Has she ever seen a meter stick?

89
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,000
That's usually taller than, like...

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
That's, like, as tall as you are.

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,720
No, a meter's... Oh, wait.

92
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,740
A meter's, like, 60 inches.

93
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,800
Wait, how do you know that, like, on the top of your head?

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,600
It's 12 feet.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,320
Wait, I don't know, 6 feet?

96
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,640
Okay, it's 3 feet, but 500 pounds.

97
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,600
No way!

98
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,060
Oh my god, that's a heavy lion.

99
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,260
He's steel-type, so it makes sense.

100
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,120
He's probably not gonna lay on you, so, like, if that's, like, a scary thing, I don't think he's gonna, like, full-body press, you know?

101
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:27,860
Damn.

102
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,380
We're just talking about this straight out the gate, huh?

103
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:31,740
Okay.

104
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,460
I didn't know I did that!

105
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,620
I was like, okay.

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,940
Logistically, I mean, he's not gonna kill you.

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,720
He's gonna, you know, be on top of you logistically.

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,380
Would you chat for a million dollars?

109
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,040
Would you?

110
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,440
I'm just saying, like, can I die?

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,920
What about that?

112
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,920
Okay, what if the stipulations were that no one would know, and you get a million dollars?

113
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Would you do it?

114
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,620
Okay, but, like, that.

115
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,980
And whatever, like, injuries you have, like, the hospital can fix it.

116
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,340
Like, you can be completely cured.

117
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,400
Can they really fix that?

118
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,580
You just have to, like, infer it.

119
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,040
He's 11 meters tall!

120
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,420
He's 11 feet tall!

121
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,260
But you get a million dollars out of it, and nobody knows.

122
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,680
It's like nothing even happened.

123
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,620
I think the doctors will know what happened.

124
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,500
I think the doctors would know, but that would be breaking HIPAA.

125
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,100
The doctors would know, but that would be breaking HIPAA.

126
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,440
The doctors would know, but that would be breaking HIPAA.

127
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,600
I don't know if they put that out anywhere.

128
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,720
What if they tell their therapist?

129
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,300
Have a comparison image?

130
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,380
How about this?

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,020
I feel like this is something they would tell their therapist.

132
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,360
Who would win?

133
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,840
Three to four lines.

134
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,980
I'm gonna be honest.

135
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,200
I kinda hate that he kinda looks like a motorcycle or something.

136
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,460
He looks like he's made of car parts, and I don't really think that's very attractive.

137
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,200
That's also what I think about.

138
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,220
I look at his feet, and they kinda look like...

139
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,640
I look at his feet, and they kinda look like...

140
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,740
They have...

141
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,020
Yeah, hockey pucks!

142
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,740
Wait, I see it.

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,120
It's just kinda goofy.

144
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,260
I don't even know what those are.

145
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,200
They look like metallic parts on him.

146
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,660
Like around his legs.

147
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,540
He looks kinda like a Gundam.

148
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,720
Oh, that's true.

149
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,660
I see that.

150
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,560
I see that.

151
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,240
And then he has an avocado for a tail.

152
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,340
I see that.

153
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,500
And then he has an avocado for a tail.

154
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,940
One thing that those...

155
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,760
Like the robo furries have, the proto...

156
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,180
What are they called?

157
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,960
The proto something?

158
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,320
The proto what?

159
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,180
It's like, have you ever seen those furries that have the robot faces?

160
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,140
And they've got like LED eyes?

161
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,240
He's got that!

162
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,060
Protogen is what chat says.

163
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

164
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,740
He also looks like a zoid, too.

165
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,400
Looks like a...

166
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,080
I have no idea what that is.

167
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,960
Oh my God, I had this guy!

168
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,220
Yeah!

169
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
I freaking had this.

170
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,280
Okay, for me it's a pass.

171
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,680
I feel like I die.

172
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,900
He's kinda like...

173
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,560
Goofy.

174
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,200
Alright, so...

175
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,920
Why were you guys trying to convince me you were all gonna pass anyway?

176
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,580
This was your first pass.

177
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,280
This is funny!

178
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,620
Okay, why are you guys passing?

179
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
I feel like I just die.

180
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,120
It's not Arcanine, so...

181
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,140
It's not Arcanine!

182
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,820
I get it.

183
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,100
He just looks kinda goofy.

184
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,980
I'm not a huge fan of the design.

185
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
It's like the guy you shouldn't worry about.

186
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,840
He's dorkier than like...

187
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,680
There's a better Pokemon in his demographic here.

188
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,380
That's true.

189
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,520
You have too much toys and fake parts, dude.

190
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,160
I need flesh and blood.

191
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,080
Bro looks like he needs to be assembled.

193
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,300
It comes like in a package.

194
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,100
Why don't you go to your mom and put yourself back together?

195
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,780
You gotta get like...

196
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,960
AAA batteries.

197
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,760
Like batteries not included.

198
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,000
Alright.

199
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,320
Pass.

200
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,280
Alright, Latias.

201
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,640
Smash.

202
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,140
Smash.

203
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,740
Smash, yes.

204
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,080
Did you see the movie, Doki?

205
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,820
As soon as Bow was like, instant smash on Latias, she's seen the movie.

206
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Yeah, no, I've seen like...

207
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,500
Didn't Ash like kiss this Pokemon?

208
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,640
Yes.

209
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,900
Map me up, Ash.

210
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,340
Map me up.

211
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:22,820
Me too.

212
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,260
She can, I will agree.

213
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,580
She can shapeshift, right?

214
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,720
To any form you want.

215
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,540
So it's like, she's basically like a shapeshifter.

216
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,980
Like if you don't...

217
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,080
But like, are you smashing that form or...

218
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,740
What form though?

219
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,540
Whatever she wants to be that day.

220
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,680
She is...

221
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,020
She's a nice woman.

222
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,320
She's like kind and loving.

223
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,060
She's the perfect girl.

224
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,080
Wait, she has a child?

225
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,180
Wait.

226
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,620
Who's the father?

227
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,560
Someone said she has a child.

228
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,480
You're right, I will agree.

229
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,720
She is a better ditto.

230
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,740
Wait, this is real, I don't know this.

231
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,760
Oh my god!

232
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,100
We're siblings?

233
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,060
Anyway.

234
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,180
I've never seen that movie.

235
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,920
I didn't realize they ate more.

236
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,160
Um, I mean...

237
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,600
Look, they're an endangered species.

238
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,340
There's two of their kind.

239
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,740
And, you know...

240
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,620
They have babies!

241
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,520
I didn't even know that was how we get purebred like...

242
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,940
Dogs and stuff.

243
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,920
Oh my god, she's a Labrador!

244
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,040
She's a Labrador.

245
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,920
I mean, she's gotta save the bloodline.

246
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,500
Oh my god.

247
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,260
So, one million dollars and nobody would...

248
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,080
It's to save a bloodline, Doki.

249
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,980
Yeah, it's to save a bloodline.

250
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,880
And no one would know.

251
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,840
I'll agree.

252
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,620
Yeah, we get rid of all the DNA reports.

253
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,800
Like, we forge them all.

254
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,860
I would say...

255
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,500
There's only two of its kind!

256
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,980
Well, what about the lion?

257
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,080
There was only one of his kind!

258
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,520
We didn't even pass on him!

259
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,940
Yeah, but he was like an LED.

260
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,740
That's what I'm saying.

261
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,200
We can build another one of his.

262
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,820
Okay, I'll say...

263
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,640
Because...

264
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,440
Because she is...

265
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,520
She can shapeshift.

266
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,660
I will smash.

267
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,720
I will smash.

268
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,600
You know the girl version of her?

269
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,060
This is her.

270
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,320
No, no.

271
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,420
Oh, like what she looks like.

272
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay, okay.

273
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
Me too, Ash.

274
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,220
Me too, Ash.

275
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,640
She can give you upbeats.

276
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,720
She is!

277
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,820
Okay, she's pretty cute.

278
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,420
He's like chasing her around the city.

279
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,240
It was so cinematic.

280
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,920
I remember it to this day.

281
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,120
What does her child look like?

282
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,540
What do her children look like?

283
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,920
What if they're Ash's kids?

284
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
I don't know what Pokemon Heroes is.

285
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,280
That came out...

286
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
Oh, it says 2002.

287
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,260
Wait, what the fuck?

288
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,520
It is implied.

289
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,760
Since it was after her kiss with Ash, it was Ash's child.

290
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,460
Her brother had died prior to that.

291
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,740
The brother, Latios, died?

292
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,400
Yeah, Latios...

293
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,260
Well...

294
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,860
Wait, I don't even remember her flying away with kids at the end of that movie.

295
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,620
That's crazy.

296
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,920
I saw this movie like 20 bajillion years ago.

297
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,240
What?

298
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,520
I don't remember that at all.

299
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,400
So like, is that how Pokemon eggs are made?

300
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,520
They just kiss each other and then an egg pops out?

301
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,260
I think it's like Pokemon lore that nobody knows how eggs are made.

302
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,200
Oh, nobody knows.

303
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:21,220
It's like Latios takes his hair or something and then it closes it.

304
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,140
It's like fish, you know?

305
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,220
It's like any bodily fluid or parts works.

306
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,550
I mean, think about the plant Pokemon.

307
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,470
Yeah, it's like...

308
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:41,890
I don't know.

309
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,190
Like...

310
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:59,710
In Diamond and Pearl, if you go to the library in Jubilife City or something, I can't remember, but you go there and there's a book that talks about how Pokemon and humans used to like...

311
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,090
Yeah, they used to get married with each other.

312
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,190
Yeah, and then there's like that Typhlosion thing that...

313
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,590
Oh my god, that's right!

314
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:15,010
I literally memory hold that.

315
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,350
Oh my god, no.

316
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,090
I think I fell asleep yesterday thinking about that slacking one or whatever.

317
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,450
Oh no!

318
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,130
I don't want to think about it anymore!

319
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,290
Wait, what's the slacking one?

320
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,710
I just know about the Typhlosion one.

321
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,250
Oh my god, you haven't read the other stories?

322
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,610
After reading Typhlosion, I was like...

323
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,790
I literally buried that so deep in my mind.

324
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,190
I even remember tweeting about it.

325
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,230
Wait, what's the slacking one?

326
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,490
What did the slacking do?

327
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,270
They were all like...

328
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,150
Okay, you know like Disney princesses?

329
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,690
They all come from old fairy tales, but then if you read the true original fairy tale, it's like something really freaked up and horrific.

330
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,630
It's like that.

331
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,290
And there's...

332
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,010
Lots of...

333
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,010
It's pretty graphic.

334
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,970
Is it worse than the Typhlosion one?

335
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,490
Did you kidnap her or something?

336
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,570
The Typhlosion was like kidnapping, but she was like, it's okay, I'll live with you.

337
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,450
Yeah, and then they had like a hybrid.

338
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,830
It has like...

339
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,270
I think like...

340
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,710
I don't...

341
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,790
I don't know how to put it.

342
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,270
Hmm...

343
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,610
Like replace some words with like...

344
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,310
Okay, so slacking...

345
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:31,730
Yeah?

346
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,070
Take your time.

347
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:35,890
Slacking...

348
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,150
I'm really grabbing for straws here at the word.

349
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,070
So slacking...

350
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,690
Inconsiderately did some...

351
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,010
Oh...

352
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,090
Inconsiderately.

353
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,790
Inconsiderately.

354
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,070
So inconsiderate.

355
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,290
You look very inconsiderate in this story.

356
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:56,790
Rude.

357
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,710
Wait, slacking is like...

358
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,850
It's the gorilla one, right?

359
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,070
I think it's like a gorilla sloth.

360
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,710
Is that the final...

362
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,570
That's the final evolution one, right?

363
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,650
The one that looks like Donkey Kong?

364
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,750
The giant one.

365
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,350
The one that is asleep all the time.

366
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,150
Alright, okay.

367
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,630
Anyway, let's not smash.

368
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,650
Let's go, that was easy.

369
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,910
Alright.

370
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,150
Mianfu.

371
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,650
And he's like...

372
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,890
It's cute.

373
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,350
I don't know if I want to smash that.

374
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,810
Oh my God, I found it.

375
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,010
Okay, I found the story.

376
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,570
I forgot how it was even started.

377
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,310
It's so bad.

378
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,230
Okay, the story starts by this little kid going around the forest or something...

379
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,890
and she like...

380
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,950
I think this one...

381
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,290
There was like Slakoth, the baby one.

382
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:51,630
Yeah.

383
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,050
And they...

384
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,230
One of them was like injured or something.

385
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,910
Oh yeah, okay, here we go.

386
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,110
Every day they were bored, the humans were bored.

387
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,350
So they would often catch Slakoth living in a nearby forest.

388
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,110
They would play cruel games with the captured Slakoth.

389
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,810
And sometimes killing them for fun.

390
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,010
Gouging out their eyes and cutting off their ears.

391
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:11,350
What the fuck?

392
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,750
And then eventually they come back and they start like killing all the humans and doing stuff to them.

393
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,510
Because they were like...

394
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,470
Remember?

395
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,050
Remember how you used to kill us?

396
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,330
Well, we're gonna kill you.

397
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,990
I think the craziest part is just the fact that...

399
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,850
They wrote all these stories, but they never...

400
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,470
They like...

401
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,110
Just for fun.

402
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,430
It was never published out.

403
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,650
It was just...

404
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,230
I don't know how this was even like never scrubbed.

405
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,910
Why was this just like on company computers?

406
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,090
Yeah, like on a company computer.

407
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,870
They're just like, let's just write some stories.

408
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,910
It's my bedtime story.

409
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,190
I love to read it every night.

410
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,050
It really does read like an ancient folklore though.

411
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:50,510
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,850
That's the reality of the ones that like...

413
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,610
Ancient civilizations have.

414
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,630
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,990
Like the world build, the Pokemon world.

416
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,610
But then like...

417
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,730
But it's like...

418
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,370
It never feels like it influenced the world itself.

419
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:06,810
Like...

420
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,890
Yeah, so what does this mean?

421
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,230
Like...

422
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,030
How does this change the trout population?

423
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,210
What is this, like a weasel?

424
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,930
Oh, this one, Mianfu?

425
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,130
Isn't he like...

426
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,830
A child?

427
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,230
Isn't this a child?

428
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,970
Isn't that a child?

429
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,030
It evolves at level 50.

430
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:25,990
Oh, okay.

431
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,990
So this is the final evolution of something.

432
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:30,330
No, no.

433
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,310
It starts to evolve at level 50.

434
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,670
So it's only got one evolution.

435
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,890
But it's not for 50 levels.

436
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,930
Which is really insane.

437
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,790
Okay, so he could be level 30.

438
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,150
And it'd be fine.

439
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,310
Well, it depends on how you see that.

440
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,590
It's like...

441
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,470
Do you see level where there's a baby Pokemon evolution?

442
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,770
Or do you see level based on age or experience?

443
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,010
Yeah, I'm like...

444
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,690
Is levels considered age?

445
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,210
Or like...

446
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,610
Just you look at them and it was like...

447
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,150
He looks like he's like...

448
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,730
He looks like he's just starting.

449
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,030
This is a weasel, Doki.

450
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,070
It's a weasel, Doki.

451
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,690
It's a weasel.

452
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,910
It's a weasel.

453
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,410
It's a fictional weasel.

454
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,790
It evolves at level 50.

455
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,250
Smash your butt.

456
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,070
It's only 1.5 meters.

457
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,070
1.5 meters.

458
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,550
Okay, okay.

459
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,830
It's two feet tall.

460
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,130
Wait, he's not that tiny.

461
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:25,630
I would pass.

462
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,430
It's just kind of meh to me.

463
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,410
I kind of want to squeeze it like a stress toy.

464
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,910
It kind of looks like it's meant to be gripped like that.

465
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,150
It's kind of cheap.

466
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,530
Like a proper chicken?

467
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,150
Kind of phallic, so maybe like...

468
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,730
I was gonna say kind of like a...

469
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,930
I mean, it does have the balls down there.

470
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,990
Yeah, it's got like that conal shape.

471
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,910
He has the...

472
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,950
The shape.

473
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,130
I would pass, though.

474
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,050
Yeah, I'd pass.

475
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,790
Alright, pass.

476
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,690
Oh, it's so rude.

477
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,990
He looks wild.

478
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,210
He looks like...

479
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:04,810
Oh my god.

480
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,790
The mask in Legend of Zelda.

481
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,350
What the heck is it called again?

482
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:10,870
The...

483
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,950
The magnamious...

484
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,890
What the hell is a mask called?

485
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,730
Majora!

486
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,010
Oh, Majora!

487
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,910
Magnamious mask.

488
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,310
It sounds like Ignoramus.

489
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,910
You goddamn magnamious.

490
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,450
I'm gonna pass.

491
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,330
This thing looks like it would kill me.

492
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,850
Yeah, I pass.

493
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,490
Yeah, I pass.

494
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,070
I pass.

495
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,750
Oh, no!

496
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,030
No, you're such a little guy!

497
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,550
No!

498
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,770
You're such a cute little guy!

499
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,090
My face!

500
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,350
It's like if he whips it out and it's like a...

501
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,350
Like a Subway...

502
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,070
No!

503
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,830
No!

504
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,590
It's like...

505
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,670
Don't take away my whimsy!

506
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,730
What if they stack on top of each other?

507
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,070
One pulls it out and one's like on top and then they're like...

508
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,610
What?

509
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,230
Like a Lego?

510
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,230
Is that like a Lego?

511
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,250
Yeah, because the Darumaka are always like on top of each other.

512
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,390
Oh, that's true.

513
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:15,610
That's true.

514
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,490
The lore.

515
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,230
Alright.

516
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:21,830
I pass.

517
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,790
Okay, wait.

518
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,470
Are you pass or smash?

519
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,590
Does it count as smashing if I debated like putting it up my butt?

520
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:30,750
No!

521
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,920
The hole is a hole.

522
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,120
The hole is a hole.

523
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,980
Yeah, but it's like not the right hole.

524
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,120
Wow, what a beautiful day.

525
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,580
Jack, where did all my Darumakas go?

526
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,340
Wait, did you have anything to give me?

527
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,860
You have multiple.

528
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,300
You have multiple.

529
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,920
Where'd they go?

530
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,600
Hey, everybody.

531
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,280
Why can't you sit down, Snuffy?

532
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,300
Take a seat.

533
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,060
Sorry about those Darumaka, Bao.

534
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,400
All good.

535
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,720
You can keep them.

536
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,460
Yippee!

537
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,660
Oh.

538
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,620
Hey, Snuffy's your favorite.

539
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,120
Well, it's your second favorite.

540
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,220
Puppy.

541
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,180
Yeah, I can't look at him like that.

542
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,960
He's just a puppy.

543
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,620
Yeah, he's just a good boy.

544
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,380
I just want to give him like scrunchies on his face.

545
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,160
He's just...

546
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,700
What?

547
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,720
You befriend him to get closer to the dad.

548
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,720
He'll be like, I'm gonna be your new mommy.

549
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,200
Yeah, he'd be such a good boy.

550
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,000
Let's make some...

551
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,160
Let's make some new...

552
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,640
Give you a step-brother.

553
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,100
Oh my god.

554
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,700
Let's give you a half-brother.

555
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,800
A whole littering thing.

556
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,840
I was gonna say.

557
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,840
Oh my god, sorry.

558
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,400
Puppies for sale.

559
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,180
Let's start a puppy mill.

560
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,240
That was my naming call.

561
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,640
It's time to...

562
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,120
Make some labradoodles.

563
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,660
What?

564
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,620
Alright, pass.

565
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,020
Among us.

566
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,180
How?

567
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,440
Among us?

568
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,840
Like...

569
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,320
I mean...

570
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,760
It's a mushroom.

571
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,300
I don't know what I'm...

572
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,040
What do you do with it?

573
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,640
If I was a guy?

574
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,660
Okay, I was gonna say.

575
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,740
If I was a guy, then I'd say smash.

576
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,540
Because like, that's one thing I could use.

577
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,260
That's like a pipe cleaner in length, Okie.

578
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,840
What are you saying?

579
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,520
No, it has a mouth.

580
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,280
Right there.

581
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,620
Look how small the little hole is.

582
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,580
That's like a spaghetti noodle.

583
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,160
You don't know, it could stretch.

584
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,400
You pencil-dicking that thing?

585
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,240
It's a mushroom.

586
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,440
My name is Skinny Penis.

587
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,540
Yes, girls.

588
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,320
Give me slay.

589
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,980
Oh my god, are you judging?

590
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,140
Are you judging?

591
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,480
I still think this looks like...

592
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,660
It just...

593
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,240
Well, it's a mushroom, right?

594
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,280
Okay, how inhumane it is if I cut the whole thing?

595
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,300
You know, it looks like...

596
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,200
You know...

597
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,060
It should go up your butt.

598
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:48,780
How?

599
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,000
Wait, how big is this?

600
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,100
I don't know if I should say it.

601
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,260
I'm just feeling the waters out right now.

602
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,260
Okay, but like...

603
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,120
How big is this?

604
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,260
Okay, right.

605
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,520
Yes.

606
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,420
Let's get the details.

607
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,220
Amoongus.

608
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,040
Amoongus.

609
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,120
Amoongus.

610
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,540
It's two feet.

611
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,360
Wait, that's a pretty big mushroom.

612
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,020
It doesn't say like width though.

613
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,820
That's true.

614
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,420
You gotta know the width of the...

615
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,000
It does weigh 23 pounds, so about...

616
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,720
Maybe like a heavier pound.

617
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,400
I don't know.

618
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,540
Rather light, honestly.

619
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,020
And then you can grow the mushroom.

620
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,340
You can like cut one...

621
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,040
Wait, maybe like the limbs grow back, right?

622
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,360
So you cut one of the mushrooms.

623
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,200
You can like grow it after like a post thing.

624
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,160
Like, you know, if you're hungry.

625
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,720
I'm trying to see if it says anything about getting its arms cut off.

626
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,460
Yeah, any fun facts?

627
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,860
It's actually highly poisonous.

628
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,680
Oh.

629
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,400
Oh.

630
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,160
It lures prey close by dancing and waving its arms.

631
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,040
So I guess it...

632
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,120
It shows that like Pokeballs...

633
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,260
And it's like, ooh, Pokeballs.

634
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,300
I feel like it's more of a threatening thing.

635
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,460
Well, it lures Pokemon, I guess.

636
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:02,960
I don't know.

637
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,200
What is prey?

638
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,180
Does it eat Pokemon?

639
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,000
What does that mean?

640
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,100
It lures prey close.

641
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,320
I guess it lures a bug Pokemon?

642
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,780
Maybe they like...

643
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,100
Fungusify the Pokemon.

644
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,900
Oh, true.

645
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,280
So it's like the Parsec.

646
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,520
It's like the crab ones, too.

647
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,240
Who called it a biodegradable plug?

648
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,500
Oh my God.

649
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,300
What?

650
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,020
Biodegradable?

651
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,100
What does that even mean?

652
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,140
If I leave it in my ass long enough, it'll just like decompose, bro?

653
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,560
What did it get?

654
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,180
Moldy?

655
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,260
What did it get?

656
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,320
Moldy in your ass?

657
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,680
You'll probably grow more mushrooms.

658
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,620
You become part of the mushroom.

659
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,260
Like it starts controlling you.

660
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,520
A fungus colony.

661
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,240
A fungus colony.

662
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,440
Like a suppository.

663
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,220
Oh my God.

664
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,700
I feel like I already need to sit down and have a deep thought.

665
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,400
Boofing up fungus so your body can become a fungus colony.

666
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,540
That's really how we...

667
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,860
It's just like last of us.

668
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,700
Oh my God.

669
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,720
Stuffy's gonna be patient zero.

670
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,320
She's just putting random things up her ass.

671
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,080
She's just sewing with you.

672
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,380
She just puts random stuff up her ass.

673
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,200
There's no cure.

674
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,000
Nothing can satisfy her.

675
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,460
You know how Pokemon's slogan is like, gotta catch them all?

676
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:33,500
I don't know.

677
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,800
Dude, this is just gonna be like...

678
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,560
You know that episode of Pokemon where like Tentacruel starts attacking the city and taking over people?

679
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,320
Oh my God.

680
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,540
I saw one like that too from like a later series.

681
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,580
But it was like the same thing but instead of Tentacruel it was like...

682
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,360
Oh, Malamar I think it's name is.

683
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,460
Which is a really...

684
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,500
So there's this Pokemon called Malamar.

685
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Wait, I think it's Malamar.

686
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,200
Or is that a rock?

687
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,160
Yeah, Malamar.

688
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,220
And it's like this tentacle one.

689
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,800
Let me post a picture for you guys.

690
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,040
And like it's really scary because like the lore of it says it's like...

691
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,520
Oh, the giant squid.

692
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,560
Yeah, it's like an alien.

693
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,500
And they're smarter than humanity.

694
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,800
And like they're actually super evil.

695
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,340
And in the anime they start mind controlling people to do their bidding.

696
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:23,740
What?

697
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,720
Just like in Baldur's Gate.

698
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,000
Yes, it's literally Baldur's Gate.

699
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,580
Oh my god.

700
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,520
It was kinda hard.

701
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,100
Just like in Baldur's Gate when you smash the octopus man.

702
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,780
I get it.

703
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,520
Alright, for me it's a pass.

704
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,220
I just don't know about Snuffy though.

705
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,440
I can't tell.

706
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,200
I'm kinda curious.

707
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,300
I sold myself on this.

708
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,080
You wanna smash?

709
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,260
Okay, me I'm pass.

710
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,260
What about you, Bal?

711
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,140
I don't know.

712
00:29:52,320 --> 00:30:01,220
If I boofed it and I could experience like eternal euphoria due to like the hallucination of it's spores then yeah, sure.

713
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,540
Why the hell not?

714
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,160
You didn't even think about that.

715
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,300
You know I'm like a permanent ayahuasca in your ass.

716
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,780
Like a permanent trip or something?

717
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,240
Alright, you know what?

718
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,760
This might be better than reality.

719
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,720
This is a positive story.

720
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,180
It's like an on and off.

721
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,780
You just like pull it out and you're fine.

722
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,680
And then you put it back in and you're like colors of all sorts.

723
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,000
Exactly.

724
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm passing.

725
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,480
I'm passing.

726
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,460
Oh, a swan.

727
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,120
That's just straight up a chicken.

728
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,060
That's just a duck.

729
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,960
It's also like holding it's arms on it's hips accusatorily.

730
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,460
Aren't ducks like scary as fuck?

731
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,900
Yeah, they eat people.

732
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,620
Once they get a taste of human flesh they crave it.

733
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,420
They also are like really aggressive too.

734
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,000
They actually attack people.

735
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,400
Is this a caring swan?

736
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,660
Hmm, okay.

737
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,320
So it says swans start to dance at dusk.

738
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,420
The one dancing in the middle is the leader of the flock and it administers sharp, powerful pecks with it's billet.

739
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,920
Okay, that doesn't sound hot.

740
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,320
To deliver forceful, repeated strikes.

741
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,160
And then...

742
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,640
I think it's just like they move in packs and they're very elegant.

743
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,720
I feel like they just be really aggressive in general though.

744
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,560
I don't think it'd be a fun time.

745
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,120
I kind of love how they have like bras on it.

746
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,820
Yeah!

747
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,420
It looks like a little...

748
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,580
Like a little cleavage showing there.

749
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,820
The only look, no touchy.

750
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,700
Don't touch the goods.

751
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,960
Alright, I'm passing though.

752
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,880
I don't want to get involved with this.

753
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,200
I'm gonna pass.

754
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,920
There's just better fish in the sea.

755
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,060
There's just better...

756
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,320
Yeah, better birds out there.

757
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,340
Alright, Snuffy.

758
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:51,900
What about you?

759
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,020
I'll...

760
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,320
I'll pass.

761
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:55,940
Pass.

762
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,420
That was so quick.

763
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,460
Pass.

764
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,140
Snuffy, please don't debate on this.

765
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,880
This is a challenge.

766
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,520
I want to know.

767
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,300
I just want to know.

768
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,080
What the third degree burns on your wrist you will feel like?

769
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,300
What if there's flesh inside those rocks?

770
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,540
Like a shell, you know?

771
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,860
What if it's actually cooling in there?

772
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,180
It's red.

773
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,800
It's glowing red, Snuffy.

774
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,040
What's at the top of it?

775
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,900
I don't think it's...

776
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,520
He looks ready and raring to go.

777
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,340
Where would you stick it?

778
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,020
Stick...

779
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,920
It's too wide here.

780
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,380
It says he's part of a mineral group.

781
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,080
Oh, if you're low on magnesium, this might be the guy for you.

782
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,420
Yeah, you can suck on the coal.

783
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,200
Anemia.

784
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,740
You know how some people make rock soup and stuff?

785
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,360
Yeah, the iron soup.

786
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,400
It says it forms coal inside of its body.

787
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,840
Coal dropped by this Pokemon once helped fuel fires of the people of the region.

788
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,620
By rapidly rolling its legs, it can travel over 18 miles per hour.

789
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,820
The temperature of the flames it breathes exceeds 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.

790
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:23,150
The temperature inside its body increases when it experiences strong emotions.

791
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,250
It rolls around frantically while spewing flames.

792
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,770
It produces renewable energy.

793
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,770
It shits out renewable energy.

794
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,590
I mean, it'd be a perfect...

795
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,270
Dude, it gets faster and hotter when it's excited.

796
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,910
That's awesome.

797
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,090
That's awesome for you, Stephanie.

798
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,810
Maybe we do have a lot more in common than I thought.

799
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,850
Man, I'm gonna have to say it.

800
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,070
I think, yeah, I just don't think there's any fucking it if it's 1,800 Fahrenheit.

801
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,410
That's just unfortunate.

802
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,130
I'd be screaming in pain before it even gets close to me.

803
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,870
Maybe I could just rub my toes on it for one of those, like, hot coal baths or something.

804
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:06,750
Oh, that's true.

805
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,410
Oh, yeah.

806
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,890
You put him in the water.

807
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,110
Yeah, you put, like, water in it.

808
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,810
More than that, so I'll have to pass.

809
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,690
Then he'll die.

810
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,310
Pass.

811
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:16,490
Oh, crap.

812
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,750
What even is this?

813
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:24,230
It's, like, this gigantic Maxwell's the giant gorilla, but he's you know, he brings the band over I guess.

814
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,010
He brings the entire band.

815
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,290
What's happening?

816
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,210
What am I looking at?

817
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,750
Like, where does the Pokemon start?

818
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,790
He's right here.

819
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,230
This is his, like, garage band set up.

820
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,670
So he's right here.

821
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,370
Right here.

822
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,930
That's him right there.

823
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,870
I'm gonna say pass.

824
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:49,050
Like, I don't want him to, like, play on his garage band set up while, like, you know, stuff is happening.

825
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,250
Right.

826
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,230
Like, at that point, he's distracted.

827
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,290
He's not.

828
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,510
I don't like how he has, like, extra arms that are, like, tree branches.

829
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,730
That sounds... That sounds ouch.

830
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,950
Wrapping around you is, like, thumbs up, but then, like, with the, like, splinters.

831
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,770
Okay, here's Wonderwall.

832
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,870
Here's Wonderwall before we begin.

833
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,270
Here's Wonderwall.

834
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,330
Someone's, like, you know he can do it on the rhythm.

835
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,210
Thumbs up.

836
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,430
Oh, my God.

837
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,310
I can't.

838
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,610
He's so romantic.

839
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:30,870
Wow.

840
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,290
Pass.

841
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,570
I'm a pass.

842
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,310
I'm a pass.

843
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,350
Unless he wants me to squirt on the drum.

844
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,040
Saw's Book Spring.

845
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,500
Oh, yeah.

846
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,020
This guy only comes out in the spring.

847
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,580
Oh.

848
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,120
What does that mean?

849
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,360
I don't know anymore, Snuffy.

850
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,720
What does it mean, Snuffy?

851
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,760
I don't know what it means anymore.

852
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,440
Spring season, like, you know, salmon.

853
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,620
Care to elaborate?

854
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:21,660
Well, they beat their heads repeatedly against a rock when they... So he'll just be distracted.

855
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,220
Let's see what the Pokédex has to say.

856
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,760
They migrate according to the seasons.

857
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,920
People can tell the season by looking at its horns.

858
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,640
The plants grow on its horns change according to the season, yet they migrate, blah, blah, blah.

859
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:42,380
It seems that Saw's Book has many flowers on its ancestors will grow at a slightly slower pace because the flowers absorb the Pokémon's nutrients?

860
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,520
What?

861
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,940
The flowers are actually, it's like a body.

862
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,380
What?

863
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,780
Okay, that's like his flesh, I guess.

864
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,200
So this is like a fungus situation.

865
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:54,580
Yeah.

866
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,320
Oh god, it says there are many Saw's Book enthusiasts.

867
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,160
The darker the red of the foliage that hangs from its antlers, the more stylish the Saw's Book is thought to be.

868
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,640
So he has like his own personal fan group, I guess.

869
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,860
Why did the Pokédex specify that like, just period, just like it has enthusiasts?

870
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,380
Period.

871
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,680
People really, really, really like Saw's Book, I guess.

872
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,040
It's pretty.

873
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,940
I say pass.

874
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,180
I say pass.

875
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,740
It's not...

876
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,120
I don't know.

877
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,600
It's just a deer.

878
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,940
Yeah, it's just a deer.

879
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,540
With parasitic flowers, yeah.

880
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,380
Alright, pass.

881
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,320
Yeah.

882
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,480
Smash.

883
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,280
Did we have residual thoughts of the last Pokémon?

884
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,480
I'm so curious.

885
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,080
Yeah, okay, well, I was just like...

886
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,300
You know what?

887
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:47,720
Actually, maybe.

888
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,660
I can't!

889
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,640
It can be anything you want it to be.

890
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,180
It can be anything you want it to be.

891
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,840
So like...

892
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,480
Are we smashing that or like whatever he transforms?

893
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,440
I'm just loyal to Suicune, so like anything similar to Suicune, I just feel like I'm cheating on Suicune.

894
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,820
Okay, you can turn it into anything.

895
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,400
I'd say smash, then.

896
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,680
Oh, are you snuffy?

897
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,360
It can transform into anything.

898
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,500
When it transforms, it changes into a stone to avoid being attacked.

899
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,640
It doesn't have to just be Pokémon, so that's like definitely a candidate.

900
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,200
Yeah, yeah, no, there's like an episode where he transforms into like a person.

901
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,860
Oh, you know this one.

902
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,340
Yeah, because the face is like a ditto.

903
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,220
It depends on how good the ditto is.

904
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,160
There's like dittos that are like massive.

905
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,600
How good are you?

906
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,900
Okay, you know like there's like this Okay, have you guys ever heard about this Pokémon manga where it's like it's super hardcore, like Pokémon Red or some shit.

907
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,880
I don't remember what it's actually.

908
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,840
Yeah, and then like, you know, yeah, and it shows like decapitated Pokémon and eating Pokémon and stuff like that.

909
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:03,300
And then there was one of the storylines where like the ditto actually transforms into a Pokémon trainer and he's like evil or whatever.

910
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,040
But he's like a really like high level ditto.

911
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,000
So you can't tell it's a ditto.

912
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,780
So like smash.

913
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,460
All I need is...

914
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:17,900
I'm gonna transform.

915
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm gonna get a ditto.

916
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,820
Have it transform into Doki.

917
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,140
Do like a smash or pass stream of like all the Pokémon and smash every single one of them.

918
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,660
That is your entire goal.

919
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,240
Instead of trying to...

920
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,880
It doesn't talk though.

921
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,420
So yeah, Doki being like, would you smash this?

922
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,880
And Doki would just nod like...

923
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,420
I'll have the ditto hit like a pre-recorded like sound bites of Doki saying smash.

924
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,980
Oh yeah, I would smash.

925
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,640
Thank you, Doki.

926
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,160
They're all like spliced together words and stuff.

927
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,980
Alright, Torracat.

928
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,220
No, pass.

929
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,580
I would smash his father.

930
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,880
I was gonna say, I think like...

931
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,840
His father scares me.

932
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,320
His father is a little goofy and it took some time to grow on me, but I would smash his father.

933
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,300
I'm glad he's low.

934
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,660
Why don't you want to smash the dad?

935
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,980
He's a freak.

936
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,480
You don't even know him.

937
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,880
Have you met him?

938
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,520
He's a freak.

939
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,500
He gives uncomfortable vibes.

940
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,780
What is he gonna do?

941
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,580
Maybe after like four drinks.

942
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,720
Four drinks?

943
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,280
He would just hit your ass when you walk across him at the bar.

944
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,580
He would probably start crying about his ex-wife.

945
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,860
I have three kids.

946
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,320
I don't know why she left.

947
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,920
I just kept buying trading cards from cereal boxes, but she left me.

948
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,020
Pass.

949
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,080
What is that?

950
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,260
Do you guys know the lore on this guy?

951
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,780
He's all messed up.

952
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,900
I hate it.

953
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,520
I think it's really fucked up and it makes me uncomfortable.

954
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,500
Yeah, pass.

955
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,220
They're not even part of the same bodies.

956
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,360
Isn't it constantly in pain or some shit?

957
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:12,260
I feel like people talk about how messed up this is and how it's real and these Pokemon were created from messed up fossils being mismatched together.

958
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,300
Two things.

959
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:20,760
Why do we continue doing it and why do we not meet humanity any ramifications for this?

960
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,880
How can we not have repentance?

961
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,920
We got repented for creating false life.

962
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,000
At this point, why are we stopping this?

963
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,580
These evil corporations are bad.

964
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,220
But we can create fucked up Pokemon and that's okay.

965
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,180
How come after the flick off?

966
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,000
Because there's two versions of him, right?

967
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,400
There's one where it's the head.

968
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,500
There's five?

969
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,640
Yeah, there's a ton of them.

970
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,240
There's at least four, I think.

971
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,860
No, that's so sad.

972
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,500
I hate it here.

973
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,160
I thought it was just three because there's three distinct parts.

974
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,700
Oh my god.

975
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,780
They're like, maybe like the second attempt it'll be better.

976
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,900
And then they just fucked up every attempt.

977
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,660
They didn't get it right a single time.

978
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,780
I can't.

979
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,440
Someone said it's just like Full Metal Alchemist.

980
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:04,820
Goodbye.

981
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,860
But they do it four more times.

982
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,400
At least they have ramifications.

983
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,620
At least there's even like laws there.

984
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,860
There's no laws.

985
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,080
Are there Pokemon rights?

986
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,180
Wait, do Pokemon have rights?

987
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,560
No!

988
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,460
They're items.

989
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,280
I mean, they basically are.

990
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,460
If you put it in a Pokeball and leave it dusting on a shelf for 20 minutes.

991
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,080
Yeah, you put it in your computer and it's a data mine.

992
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,360
And mine me some Bitcoin Pokemon.

993
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,020
I took this thing from its family so I could just mine Bitcoin.

994
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,160
No, you know like once I got the digital Pokemon.

995
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,560
What was it, the Polly?

996
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:43,840
Digimon!

997
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,640
No, the Polly.

998
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,900
Porygon, Porygon, Porygon.

999
00:42:50,600 --> 00:43:02,160
NFT bros are gonna mine for Porygon and catch like 100 Porygons, put it in my PC and mine me some Bitcoins right now.

1000
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:12,100
They're gonna use Rotom as like a cursor mouse and it'll be like, please let me see the sun just this once.

1001
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,460
Yeah, just turn your webcam on.

1002
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,700
Rotom will be like the Fallout New Vegas Mr. House type thing in the future.

1003
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,740
This is so sad.

1004
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,620
I'm passing on this weird little freak.

1005
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,940
Yeah, pass on this freak.

1006
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,440
Put him down.

1007
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,660
He went extinct for a reason.

1008
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,880
He went extinct for a reason.

1009
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,380
Oh, Bulbasaur, pass.

1010
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,660
Oh my God, chat said Team Rocket sells Porygons.

1011
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,280
They do.

1012
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,780
At the casino, they're literally selling you NFTs and shit.

1013
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,280
They're literally selling NFTs.

1014
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,920
They're selling like dragon...

1015
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,800
What was it?

1016
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,360
Oh my God, Dragonairs or whatever.

1017
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they were selling them.

1018
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,440
Yeah, dude, they're literally selling Porygons legally.

1019
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,380
That's crazy.

1020
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,360
Wait, someone was like, Team Plasma, try to give Pokemon rights and we stopped.

1021
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,780
Wait, it's so true.

1022
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,820
I played that entire game.

1023
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,360
The guys are like, you fight them and they're like, we just want Pokemon to be treated like animals.

1024
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,380
They should be left alone to the wild.

1025
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,080
Be quiet, idiot.

1026
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,640
How dare you think they deserve the same rights as us.

1027
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,880
We need them to keep mining.

1028
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,660
Wait, we send Pokemon into the mines too.

1029
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,460
No.

1030
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,200
We make all the Machop and like, exercise Pokemon, lift things and build buildings for us.

1031
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,060
Like, we're so mean.

1032
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,420
Yeah, why did we stop Team Plasma?

1033
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,720
He just capitalized these creatures that just didn't ask to exist.

1034
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,460
Wait, did you see that new...

1035
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,720
Did you see like the... There's like a new trailer that it showed for the newest Pokemon game.

1036
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,260
And the newest villain was like... Okay, I saw a screenshot for it.

1037
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,940
I don't know if he's like the actual villain.

1038
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:15,360
But like, there was a screenshot of the villain being like, apparently if you win the league or whatever, you get one special wish.

1039
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,440
And then the...

1040
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:23,660
Yeah, the guy was like, if I win, I'm gonna abolish all transportation so they're forced to use my taxi company.

1041
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,460
That's awesome.

1042
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,560
That's awesome.

1043
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,160
That's crazy.

1044
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,400
I was like, that cat...

1045
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,540
Is he a real villain?

1046
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,180
Like, the taxi...

1047
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,660
Dude, that's like catching a Jirachi and be like, I want a Dr. Pepper.

1048
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,420
He could've just wished for a million dollars, but he's just gonna say like, I wanna work for the rest of my life.

1049
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,680
Taxi driver for the rest of my life.

1050
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,280
Yeah, final boss is capitalism.

1051
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,720
I was like, holy fuck.

1052
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,280
Okay.

1053
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,240
And I'm like, wait, but then can't we just use Pokemon to fly?

1054
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,080
Like, for transportation?

1055
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,480
Yeah, that's what he's saying.

1056
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,940
I think he's trying to capitalize it because he's like, no more free walking.

1057
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,540
No more charge to travel now.

1058
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,360
They can just wish for stuff like that?

1059
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,380
Like, are they just forbidden to fly now?

1060
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,840
Like, they just don't...

1061
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,140
Like, I want my mom to die.

1062
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,300
All forms of transportation is gone now.

1063
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,380
What if somebody super twisted like that?

1064
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,700
Like, what are the rules?

1065
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,720
Is it like a Pokemon?

1066
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,920
Are they just gonna like, delete them from existence?

1067
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,960
Just control alt delete.

1068
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,680
Oh god.

1069
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,160
You know when they do like, release the Pokemon in my PC, do we just delete the data?

1070
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:52,720
Oh my god.

1071
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,040
Do we like, move the trash?

1072
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,680
Like, where do they go?

1073
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,260
Doesn't it say little text where it's just like, they have been released in the wild or something?

1074
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,500
I swear when you say release it's like, Pokemon has been released in the wild.

1075
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,300
Bye bye Pokemon!

1076
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,160
It says something like that, I swear.

1077
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:12,720
I swear!

1078
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,580
Is that true?

1079
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,700
I don't know.

1080
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,940
Or do they go to the farm upstate?

1081
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,200
You never existed.

1082
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,000
Your data is just gone.

1083
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:23,780
Forever.

1084
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,920
Alright, Bulbasaur.

1085
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,500
Pass.

1086
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:29,740
Pass.

1087
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,200
What that mouth do, Bulbasaur?

1088
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,180
I know he has like, vine whip, but like, that's a child.

1089
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:45,380
Okay, so I have like a fixation with the mouth.

1090
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,760
And I gotta say, every time I see a picture of like, a frog, you ever see the way they press their tongue against their mouth and stuff?

1091
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,920
Or like, how they eat?

1092
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,400
I'm just saying.

1093
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,860
Wait, okay, send me a picture, so maybe I can see your vision.

1094
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,900
You guys ever see the animations of all the stars being chopped up and turned into dishes?

1095
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:06,860
Oh yeah, I have.

1096
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,960
Yeah, the Chikorita one?

1097
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,400
That one was so traumatic.

1098
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,220
They like, peeled her like a banana.

1099
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,680
Yeah, they peeled her like a banana!

1100
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,780
Wait, what?

1101
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,860
What are you talking about?

1102
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,940
Oh, that's Goron, my comfort character.

1103
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,620
That literally is.

1104
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,580
Like, there's like a...

1105
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,480
I wanna do this with Bulbasaur.

1106
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,540
I'm scared.

1107
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,200
I'm scared too.

1108
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,720
What's your problem?

1109
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,180
Wait...

1110
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,960
You could...

1111
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,360
There's Ivysaur, and then there's like...

1112
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,340
What was the third one?

1113
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,800
Venusaur.

1114
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,520
Yeah, why would...

1115
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,980
I mean...

1116
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,300
Why Bulbasaur?

1117
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,000
Why not Ivysaur?

1118
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,480
They're covered in like, warts and like, overgrown weeds.

1119
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,560
What about Ivysaur?

1120
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,420
He's pretty cute.

1121
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,040
I don't know.

1122
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,800
He didn't look like he'd call me back, dude.

1123
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,380
I think you're gonna get poison ivy.

1124
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,300
And dry throat too.

1125
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,620
I'm gonna be itching for days.

1126
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,360
Bulbasaur, look how good he is, dude.

1127
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:06,980
He's clean.

1128
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,040
He's just a goofy little guy.

1129
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,620
I'm passing.

1130
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,740
But Stuffy will smash.

1131
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,280
I will smash, you're right.

1132
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
I will pass.

1133
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,160
Alright.

1134
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,480
Pass.

1135
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,140
Alright, I'mma pass.

1136
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,420
Stuffy, are you thinking?

1137
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,060
Alright.

1138
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,840
No, I don't like this guy.

1139
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,120
Yeah, I don't think we need to explain ourselves.

1140
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,580
He doesn't seem like he's having fun.

1141
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,180
Have you ever played the GameCube games?

1142
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,660
Uh, yeah.

1143
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,340
Which ones?

1144
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,320
The Shadow?

1145
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,040
The Colosseum and XD Gale of Darkness.

1146
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,800
I feel like those games made me specifically hate this whole line.

1147
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,800
Oh yeah, me too.

1148
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,420
I hate the guy.

1149
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,400
The disco man.

1150
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,060
Yeah, no, fuck that guy.

1151
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,100
And then he always shows up everywhere you go.

1152
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:53,900
None of that.

1153
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,380
And there weren't many Pokemon in that game.

1154
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,020
There was only like a hundred or so.

1155
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,780
So it was like, this guy was just there.

1156
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,660
No, my goat.

1157
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,760
I'm sorry, chat.

1158
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,480
I'm sorry.

1159
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,040
I'm not fucking your goat.

1160
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,400
I like Odicolo though.

1161
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,760
I don't like the way he dances.

1162
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,220
He freaks me out.

1163
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,360
He's like, take that back.

1164
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,280
I'm here to be a legend.

1165
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,300
Oh yeah, what about the really freaking...

1166
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:23,780
Oh my...

1167
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,680
Okay, you know what?

1168
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,400
Another good comparison here.

1169
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,060
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

1170
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,620
I was just gonna say, he is so bad.

1171
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,640
He is so bad.

1172
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,400
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

1173
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,000
Do you remember the scene where Dusknoir arrests him and ties him up?

1174
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,740
I don't know what happened to me.

1175
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,480
I don't know what happened to me.

1176
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,400
But like, I just...

1177
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,440
Something changed.

1178
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,240
And Dusknoir is just like, I finally got you.

1179
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,600
And you're just like, what's going on?

1180
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,580
And then they just grab him and yank him.

1181
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,140
And you're just like, what's going on?

1182
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,260
And he's just like, you filthy traitor.

1183
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,120
I...

1184
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,600
I want him so bad.

1185
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,260
It's insane.

1186
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
He's such a cool character in Mystery Dungeon.

1187
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,960
That game, yeah.

1188
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,060
I wouldn't have probably said Smash if it wasn't for PMDD.

1189
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,260
It's true.

1190
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,360
He was really good in that game.

1191
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,040
I would actually say Smash, yeah.

1192
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,540
I want him to rest his hand on my hips.

1193
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,840
I don't know what else to say.

1194
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,880
Oh my god, his two fingers like clenched around your bones.

1195
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,220
Yeah, please.

1196
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,080
Please.

1197
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,880
I cried playing that game.

1198
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,420
Oh no, me too.

1199
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,540
That game was so good.

1200
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:39,680
I wish they re-released it, but like I know they re-released it in a 3D format, but I wish it was like the classic 2D pixel.

1201
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,040
Yeah, yeah.

1202
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,580
It doesn't have the same soul as mine.

1203
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:51,900
I remember crying when I got to the ending, where you know, your partner was like, I'm going back to the human world now.

1204
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,260
Goodbye, my...

1205
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:53,540
God.

1206
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,260
And I was like, no, I want to stay here with my Pokemon finder.

1207
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,520
I can't, bro.

1208
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,360
I can't.

1209
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,940
Yeah, the first two games got me like a must.

1210
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,620
Such a good story.

1211
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,920
Okay, the unanimous must.

1212
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:12,480
Pass.

1213
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:13,640
Pass.

1214
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,400
Okay, well we were at peak, and I'm afraid that is very far.

1215
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,440
It's like the Sahara Desert now.

1216
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,320
Dear God.

1217
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,560
He looks like a grandpa.

1218
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,460
Like, he's like, I don't think...

1219
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,100
He's like, go back to bed, sir.

1220
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,740
I'll clean my ass after I'm done with it, dude.

1221
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,860
Doesn't he have a wife?

1222
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,520
Like, the other guy, the jealous female?

1223
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,100
He just looks like the top of my head.

1224
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,980
Oh, he looks like a Pringles mascot.

1225
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,700
Someone was like, Mr. Pringles, sir.

1226
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,420
Or like, cannot believe it.

1227
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,200
You just took your head off.

1228
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,600
This is literally...

1229
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,140
Put it back on.

1230
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,740
He's just a head.

1231
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,020
What is he gonna do?

1232
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,360
There's no mouth.

1233
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,340
There's not even a mouth.

1234
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,920
Okay, wait.

1235
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,920
Let's get some...

1236
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:12,020
The creepiest part about this Pokemon that you might not expect is that it's actually a ghost type Pokemon, right?

1237
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,160
Oh, so he's a dead grandpa.

1238
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,440
Hmm.

1239
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:25,260
The Pokedex says, the fate of ships and the crew wander into Jellicent's habitat, all sunken, all lost, all vanished.

1240
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,040
They propel themselves by expelling absorbed seawater from their bodies.

1241
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,800
Their favorite food is life energy.

1242
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,100
What does that even mean?

1243
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:40,520
Its body is mostly seawater and it says that there's a castle of ships Jellicent have sunk on the sea floor.

1244
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,340
Oh my god.

1245
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,080
Oh my God.

1246
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,100
Dude eats the souls of anyone who passes by him.

1247
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:46,600
Yeah.

1248
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,020
That's horrifying.

1249
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,140
You laughed at him and he sunk like entire navies.

1250
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,460
Someone was like, like a succubus?

1251
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,960
He's literally a succubus.

1252
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,240
He's literally a succubus.

1253
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,540
There's a siren.

1254
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,660
He's more like a siren.

1255
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,920
Oh yeah, yeah.

1256
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,040
The one that he calls the ships closer.

1257
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,060
That's a hot part.

1258
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,260
Yeah, just like Monopoly man siren.

1259
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:25,820
He's got like the cartoony eyelashes, so maybe this is actually like a feminine depiction because that's how like people always determine like a feminine picture.

1260
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:34,740
Yeah, but like what if instead of like, you might think that's like a mustache, but what if that's actually like, it's like big naturals.

1261
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:35,840
The boobs, right?

1262
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,260
It's like, it's a siren.

1263
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,700
It's supposed to have legs wrapped around its face.

1264
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,780
It might be a male but it's like, it's giving the depiction so you want to like go and squeeze.

1265
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,200
Oh, it looks like thighs, right?

1266
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,220
You want to squeeze the thighs.

1267
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:57,220
How bad is it to be like in the ocean for that long that you look at a jellicent and be like Yeah, I mean It's perfectly round, like a boob, a butt, like cheeks.

1268
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,700
Is that like a woman posing?

1269
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,700
Is she holding her cheeks?

1270
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,180
Is she masquerading?

1271
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,120
Is it cloud stew?

1272
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,200
You know like, how crazy are you feeling seven months into sea?

1273
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,040
It's like narwhals, you know?

1274
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,820
Remember when that's how mermaids were?

1275
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,800
Or that's...

1276
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:17,100
It's like, sailors wanted to sailors wanted to fuck narwhals.

1277
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:24,200
And they invented the story of mermaids because they saw a narwhal and they're like, that's that's a hot woman right there.

1278
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,320
Or was it manatees?

1279
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,320
Have you ever seen a narwhal?

1280
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,740
Sorry, I meant manatees.

1281
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
They look the same to me.

1282
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:30,600
Manatees?

1283
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,940
Except one one has a horn.

1284
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,480
I was like, what part of the human female has like a giant unicorn horn?

1285
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,280
That would be right here, pants girl.

1286
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,720
I mean, sailors wanted to fuck manatees.

1287
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,720
So like, I guess like, a jealous set ain't so far off.

1288
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,280
At least he has the thighs for it.

1289
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,700
I'll still say pass.

1290
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,740
I'm still gonna say pass.

1291
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,520
I'll still say pass.

1292
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,680
I'm gonna smash.

1293
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,220
Where would you smash?

1294
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,820
No, no, how would you smash this?

1295
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,140
Yeah, like on my nips.

1296
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,220
Like a suction thing.

1297
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,900
Wait, it kinda does.

1298
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,620
Oh, okay.

1299
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,680
You can see the vision.

1300
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,180
You just see it and pass like, wait, I see it now.

1301
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,360
I see it now.

1302
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,440
It said it's mostly seawater, so like, I'm gonna just squirt it.

1303
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,080
Oh my god.

1304
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,020
Do you fill it with a different liquid, bro?

1305
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,520
It must just simply feel like your life energy is being sucked out, so like...

1306
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,720
That must explain it.

1307
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,320
That's what they say about Vaporeon, why you're jealous and all white, dude?

1308
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:49,880
Pass.

1309
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:50,820
It's an ant.

1310
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,920
Listen, I...

1311
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,220
Yeah, this is an ant.

1312
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,300
I'm sorry.

1313
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,240
It's an ant.

1314
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,260
It's not even a hot ant.

1315
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,000
And it's made of metal.

1316
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,780
Dude, imagine I encounter this in the forest.

1317
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,460
Clank, clank, clank!

1318
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,120
Bro, he's just gonna break the bed.

1319
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,240
Pass.

1320
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,220
Oh, it's your favorite!

1321
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,560
There's Donkey!

1322
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,600
That's me!

1323
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,220
That's true!

1324
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,040
He's got your hair!

1325
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:22,640
Pass.

1326
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,740
I would smash and nickname it Donkey Bird in my game.

1327
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,420
I mean, he has a big mouth.

1328
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:34,720
If I was a guy, I'd say smash.

1329
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,280
What?

1330
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,140
I don't need to be a guy to smash.

1331
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,160
I mean, look at the mouth!

1332
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,500
He's gonna feel nice and soft and treat me well.

1333
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,000
He'll be cozy in the cold weather.

1334
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,020
He looks like, you know, like...

1335
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:55,400
If you gave a funny guy a chance and then he changes your life.

1336
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,220
Look at him in the Pokemon room.

1337
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,540
He looks like Seth Rogen.

1338
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,020
Oh.

1339
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,580
He's Seth Rogen.

1340
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,740
That's a funny guy if you gave him a chance.

1341
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,520
That's kind of what Seth Rogen gives, right?

1342
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,180
Yeah, he looks like Seth Rogen.

1343
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,980
Dude, you did his laugh really good!

1344
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:12,600
Yeah, yeah!

1345
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,540
I mean, he does look like him.

1346
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,560
He actually...

1347
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,200
He has his color palette, too.

1348
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,000
His color scheme.

1349
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,220
You weren't giving Seth Rogen color palette?

1350
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,440
Yeah, I was giving Seth Rogen color vibes.

1351
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:33,500
Wait, wait.

1352
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,980
The Pokedex entry for Ludicolo says...

1353
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,520
Ludicolo begins dancing as soon as it hears cheerful, festive music.

1354
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,900
This Pokemon is said to appear when it hears the singing of children on hiking outings.

1355
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:49,980
Upon hearing an upbeat and cheerful rhythm, the cells in Ludicolo's body become very energetic and active.

1356
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,720
Even in battle, this Pokemon will exhibit an amazing amount of power.

1357
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,020
Oh, he's strong.

1358
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,520
He doesn't look like it, though.

1359
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,360
Okay, so he's always gonna play music.

1360
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,320
Get into the vibes.

1361
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,560
So, like...

1362
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,820
Wait, he has rhythm, then.

1363
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,380
Yeah, yeah.

1364
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,340
I'm still passing.

1365
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,820
No, I think he would put on something tasteful.

1366
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,460
Like the... a marachi band.

1367
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:19,880
Yeah.

1368
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,580
He'd put on, like, Redbone.

1369
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:22,900
Redbone?

1370
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,720
What's Redbone?

1371
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,120
From Childish Gambino.

1372
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,860
Oh.

1373
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,240
I don't know how that sounds like, though.

1374
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,240
It goes like...

1375
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,320
Pass.

1376
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,800
That's a fucking rat.

1377
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,040
That's Snuffy, dude.

1378
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:45,760
That's Snuffy.

1379
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,800
Why would you smash him?

1380
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1381
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,640
Slow down here.

1382
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,480
Wait, so you'd smash Rattata?

1383
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,200
Yeah, about.

1384
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,060
You can't smash...

1385
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,120
You wouldn't smash Snuffy?

1386
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,280
Like...

1387
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,420
Well, there's one thing wrong with her.

1388
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,360
That's her equivalent.

1389
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,240
That thing is right there.

1390
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:11,840
No, no, no.

1391
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,420
The world was only Gen 1 Pokemon.

1392
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:16,860
Oh my god.

1393
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,780
No, no, no.

1394
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,420
I would be...

1395
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,120
What's your house other than Rattata?

1396
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,580
Pikachu.

1397
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,500
Not even.

1398
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,060
That's true.

1399
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,320
But she's...

1400
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,140
Yeah, but like, Pikachu is like a domesticated mouse.

1401
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,600
Rattata is like a wild rat.

1402
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:41,320
Yeah.

1403
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,720
With rabies, I guess.

1404
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,260
Yeah, with rabies.

1405
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,580
Actually, then I would 100% pass.

1406
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,460
Oh my god, Nidoran.

1407
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,440
Oh my god, I could be a caked up Nidoran.

1408
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,420
Aren't like, Nidoran's poisonous, though?

1409
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,420
Like, they bite you and then you die?

1410
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,860
You just have like...

1411
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,080
You just have antidote on you every time.

1412
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,160
Oh my god, like, what if like, it's at night and all you hear is like the poison damage sound effect?

1413
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,280
God damn it, Bow.

1414
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:23,240
It's like in the old Pokemon games where you take a step every time and you just...

1415
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,400
Every movement you make...

1416
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,320
Show off!

1417
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,340
Get my boy out of here.

1418
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,340
No, no, no, no, no.

1419
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,560
No, no, no, no, no.

1420
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,440
It's just gonna be like what's mommy and daddy doing right now?

1421
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,060
He literally has freckles.

1422
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,240
He's a little baby.

1423
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,580
This is my precious baby boy.

1424
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,540
And then Squirtle's right after.

1425
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,540
I can't.

1426
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:50,760
Squirtle!

1427
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,520
Squirtle, Squirtle.

1428
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,480
The fire squad.

1429
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,860
I wanna hold one in my arms each and give them kisses.

1430
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:57,880
They're too sweet.

1431
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:05,440
I kinda think Squirtle's hands were meant for my tits, but...

1432
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,160
I'd let him feel.

1433
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,280
I'm his mother.

1434
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,220
Let him do biscuits.

1435
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,880
Squirtle biscuits.

1436
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:14,340
Yeah.

1437
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:15,820
It'd be cold.

1438
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:15,980
It'd be cold.

1439
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,080
Flygon.

1440
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:19,680
Smash.

1441
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,240
For sure.

1442
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,080
Wait, why?

1443
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:25,740
Why?

1444
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,600
I don't know.

1445
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,240
Flygon is a good boy.

1446
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,660
I can see it.

1447
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:31,240
I get it.

1448
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:37,060
I feel like Flygon has always been depicted as like a very cool and like...

1449
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,040
I feel like there's one where he's wearing a scarf.

1450
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,340
I can't remember which game, if it's like PMD again, but there's like a really cool one where he's like a scarf.

1451
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,480
He's like a dragon.

1452
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,260
It might be like mangas too.

1453
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,200
The ones you're talking about.

1454
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,560
They like kill people.

1455
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,920
He's supposed to be like a dragonfly too.

1456
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:52,960
I mean, he looks cool.

1457
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,520
He has like the little goggles stuff going on.

1458
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,700
He's cool, suave.

1459
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,900
He has like gross bug eyes.

1460
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,060
No, he doesn't.

1461
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,860
That's just like his cover.

1462
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,540
When he flies too fast.

1463
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:07,480
It's like in Digimon.

1464
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,960
The MC always has the cool epic anime goggles.

1465
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,940
Yeah, exactly.

1466
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,200
You know, licked back hair, he's so cool.

1467
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,880
I bet the noise he'd make is crazy.

1468
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:16,860
It'd be like...

1469
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,580
Like a cicada.

1470
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,120
He's like...

1471
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,200
Vibrations, baby.

1472
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,560
Yeah, he's like...

1473
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,540
He flies really, really fast, so he has like a lot of vibrations going on.

1474
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,060
Yeah.

1475
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,520
What's the Pokédex say?

1476
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,580
It's Trump, Trapinch, and then Vibrava.

1477
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:38,480
Flagon whips up a sandstorm by its wings.

1478
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,180
The wings create a series of notes that sound like singing.

1479
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,660
Because the singing is the only thing that can be heard in the sandstorm.

1480
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,700
This Pokémon is said to be the desert spirit.

1481
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,800
A rude sandstorm.

1482
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,440
That's how you know it's nearby.

1483
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,980
Yeah, it sings.

1484
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:55,960
Smash, smash.

1485
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:56,860
You know what?

1486
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,060
I can see it.

1487
01:03:59,140 --> 01:03:59,780
I'll say smash.

1488
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,300
I can see it, yeah.

1489
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1490
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:04,180
Pass.

1491
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,040
Wait.

1492
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,960
Look at him, though.

1493
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:11,480
He's a rock!

1494
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,460
What do you mean, look at him?

1495
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:17,560
He looks like he would help carry your groceries to your car.

1496
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:23,120
And lean against the dashboard and be like, Hey, what are you doing after this?

1497
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,100
And then he'd take you to a nice dinner.

1498
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,440
Because he's like, hey, well, I actually know a place.

1499
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,300
Then he'd be like, oh, yeah.

1500
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,340
And then he'd pretend to yawn and stretch his arms around you.

1501
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,760
During the movies and whatever.

1502
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,720
He's gonna make that face before he leans in.

1503
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,720
Gives you a kiss.

1504
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,840
I still think he looks like Harry Nutz.

1505
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,300
Like with a mole on him.

1506
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,740
But what about his personality, Stuffy?

1507
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,060
There's nothing wrong with Harry Nutz.

1508
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,700
I'm just saying that's what he looks like.

1509
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,360
So what'd you smash?

1510
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,500
I dig the hairstyle and the eyebrows a lot.

1511
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,120
This is an upgrade from normal Geodude.

1512
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,180
I would say this is an upgrade from normal Geodude.

1513
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:06,280
Like this one is a Geodude with a personality.

1514
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:07,540
Yeah, yeah.

1515
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,980
The other one is a Geodude that looks like a gym bro.

1516
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,480
He looks like he goes to raves.

1517
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,280
But like, you know, he's just there for the vibes and the music.

1518
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,360
What is this freaking Geodude?

1519
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,100
What are you saying?

1520
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,380
I'm looking at this guy who looks like he's like 60 and balding.

1521
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,080
And you're like, yeah, he looks like he goes to raves.

1522
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,340
And he would take really good care of you.

1523
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,640
And he would carry your groceries.

1524
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,320
He looks like a nice guy.

1525
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,860
Who said Geodude with hair plugs?

1526
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,080
Oh, he looks like he doesn't get up off the couch anymore.

1527
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,980
And he just gave up on his dreams.

1528
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,180
No, he's not.

1529
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,740
Look at that determined face.

1530
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,180
He knows what he's about.

1531
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,620
Yeah, his life is just getting started.

1532
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,660
He knows what he's worth.

1533
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,020
I don't know, he's got wrinkles.

1534
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,200
Where?

1535
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,860
Like, look at his forehead.

1536
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,180
He's got those like stressed old man wrinkle forehead things.

1537
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,100
He's been through too much.

1538
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,280
No, it's just a dent.

1539
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,660
It's just a dent in his head.

1540
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,800
What are you trying to say?

1541
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,700
There's something wrong with having dents in your head?

1542
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:17,060
I'm just saying he's been wearing too many headphones for too long.

1543
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,400
He's been wearing them for too long.

1544
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,420
You look just like him.

1545
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,940
Alright, I didn't know you felt this way.

1546
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,320
I'll take note.

1547
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,160
Come on Tyler1, let's get out of here.

1548
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,060
Hey, Tyler1.

1549
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,140
Look, Tyler1.

1550
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,610
He got a child and he has a girlfriend.

1551
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,700
I think they're not married, right?

1552
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,700
Yeah, he got a girlfriend.

1553
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,620
He has a child.

1554
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:46,280
Look, he made it.

1555
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,540
Someday, Aloha Geodude's gonna find his perfect one.

1556
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:51,020
Match.

1557
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,360
Just like Tyler1.

1558
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,020
I'm gonna be a stay at home mom.

1559
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,520
He doesn't deserve you guys.

1560
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,420
But I'm glad that you're there for him.

1561
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:03,400
Yeah.

1562
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,540
Okay, so Bao is clearly Smash.

1563
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:08,940
I'm a pass.

1564
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,660
What about you, Snuffy?

1565
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,860
Did Bao convince you?

1566
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,060
No.

1567
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,760
I'm passing.

1568
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:21,280
Me and Geodude are gonna go to the gym and take creatine together.

1569
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:21,780
Goodbye.

1570
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,360
Pass.

1571
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:25,380
Pass.

1572
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,940
He doesn't even have eyes.

1573
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:27,520
Wait, wait, wait.

1574
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,920
Let's evolve him into Golbat.

1575
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,500
No, not Golbat.

1576
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,220
Wasn't there like an evolution above Golbat?

1577
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,300
What was his name?

1578
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:35,740
Crowbat.

1579
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,580
Wasn't Crowbat like, cooler?

1580
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,040
No, no, no.

1581
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,460
Yeah, he's cooler.

1582
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:44,360
You're right.

1583
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,180
But what is different about the two?

1584
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1585
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,580
You think about Golbat and you're just like...

1586
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:53,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1587
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,100
What lovely mouth you got, girl.

1588
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1589
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:00,020
Oh yeah, with his tongue out too and everything, right?

1590
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,180
Oh yeah, he's kinda freaky.

1591
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,720
He's kinda freaky.

1592
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,320
I'm gonna pass on Zubat, dude.

1593
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,640
Yeah, no, Zubat, yeah.

1594
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:07,800
Okay.

1595
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,080
Well,

1596
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:18,250
I think he would know some things in the bedroom, you know?

1597
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,570
He looks like he's about to dive bomb into someone's bussy.

1598
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,770
Okay, I'm gonna let you guys debate real quick.

1599
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:27,110
I need to feed my dog.

1600
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,390
I'll be right back.

1601
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:31,310
No chat, that wasn't me.

1602
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:31,830
Hello?

1603
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:35,190
Anyways.

1604
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:39,890
I just wanna know what Doki would think too.

1605
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:40,910
Bird bias.

1606
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:42,430
I wonder though.

1607
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:43,530
Okay.

1608
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:48,660
The only bird I would smash on sight is Decidueye.

1609
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:51,210
Which one is...

1610
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,770
Oh, that's Rowlet.

1611
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,310
Decidueye's good.

1612
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:55,210
I don't know why...

1613
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,150
Oh, what's the one that I like?

1614
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:58,850
He's red.

1615
01:08:59,290 --> 01:08:59,690
Fuck.

1616
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:01,310
Bird Pokemon.

1617
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:03,450
Bird Pokemon that's red?

1618
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,390
Swallow?

1619
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,750
Chat, on sight.

1620
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:09,710
It would be on sight for me.

1621
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:11,350
That's like the bird Pokemon on sight.

1622
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:13,430
If I don't think like a legendary, like Articuno.

1623
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:13,870
Moltres?

1624
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:15,010
Talonflame?

1625
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:15,850
He flies.

1626
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:16,630
He's flying.

1627
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:18,750
Chat, it's literally like a bird bird.

1628
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:19,650
Like he's a big bird.

1629
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,930
That must be from one of the new gen.

1630
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:23,690
I'm not sure.

1631
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:25,890
Nobody's got him.

1632
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,490
Everybody's just saying Talonflame.

1633
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:28,550
How could you forget the goat?

1634
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:29,510
Wait, wait.

1635
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:30,670
I don't trust chat.

1636
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:31,570
They don't know anything.

1637
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,830
I'm trying to tell them my favorite bird.

1638
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:35,290
Bravery?

1639
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:36,310
The American one?

1640
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:37,190
Bravery.

1641
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:40,490
Until the room stinks.

1642
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:43,830
Till the walls start peeling.

1643
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,390
I want my skin to have his Talon marks.

1644
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,630
He looks like a griffin, so I understand.

1645
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:51,530
Yeah.

1646
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,450
He's all muscle, dude.

1647
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,270
He's a behemoth on top.

1648
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:57,270
For America.

1649
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,510
The floors get water damage.

1650
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:01,810
Oh my.

1651
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:04,090
I want him to do that thing where birds like...

1652
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:06,450
Do that thing in the sky where they start like...

1653
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:06,650
You know.

1654
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:08,970
They clasp their Talons together?

1655
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:11,950
Yeah, they clasp their Talons and then they do...

1656
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,990
And while they're spinning in the air and plummeting.

1657
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:16,430
Okay, I didn't know about that part.

1658
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,290
I knew it was like a courtship dance.

1659
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:20,010
No, they're literally...

1660
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:22,050
They're literally doing it and then...

1661
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,730
They have to successfully finish.

1662
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,850
There's actually reports of them dying that way.

1663
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,290
Because they hit the ground before they finish.

1664
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:30,930
Oh my god, it's like a fucking adrenaline rush.

1665
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,530
This shit.

1666
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,350
He's doing tricks on it.

1667
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:38,950
I want to hear the Tony Hawk special trick noise.

1668
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:42,770
It's like...

1669
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,410
500 points.

1670
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:49,970
And then you see like...

1671
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:52,710
You know those tally scores going up on the top left.

1672
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,650
It'd be like...

1673
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:56,210
Every time you get a successful trick it's like...

1674
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:56,730
500.

1675
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:59,550
Wheelie.

1676
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:05,110
And then there's like move names for every successful trick you do.

1677
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,850
Successful wheelie.

1678
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:08,250
Wheelie.

1679
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,770
Oh my god.

1680
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,230
Style points.

1681
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,850
We gotta move to this guy.

1682
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:16,750
My boy Halucha.

1683
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:19,570
Because I could talk about bravery all day.

1684
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:20,570
My boy Halucha.

1685
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,850
Pokedex says...

1686
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:32,550
Short but sturdy.

1687
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:39,310
He's using a special move and gets itself into a pinch.

1688
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,020
Yeah, I don't think he's...

1689
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,630
He's too busy flexing on him.

1690
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:44,970
Yeah, he's too...

1691
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,390
So it's like short king.

1692
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:50,750
Short king.

1693
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:52,990
I love Luchadors though.

1694
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:54,070
They're so cool.

1695
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,410
Then why don't you like Incineroar?

1696
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,230
Yeah, why don't you like Incineroar?

1697
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:00,850
What is he?

1698
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:01,750
A freak.

1699
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:08,390
He wishes he was as cool as Halucha.

1700
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:10,850
That's like one of those WWE...

1701
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,090
They were told to be the enemy.

1702
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:13,970
To the crowd.

1703
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:15,390
Nobody likes them.

1704
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:19,630
Halucha is natty and Incineroar is not.

1705
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:20,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1706
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:22,610
You know what?

1707
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:23,730
I'm gonna smash Halucha.

1708
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:26,370
Just so I can say that I had it with a Luchador.

1709
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,170
More of a wrestler.

1710
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,190
Like a Luchador.

1711
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:31,470
WWE Pokemon.

1712
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,390
Got a little queso in me.

1713
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:34,470
Pass.

1714
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,970
What about you, Belle?

1715
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,810
He kind of gives me the ick, so I'm gonna pass.

1716
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:45,850
The ick.

1717
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:46,850
Pass.

1718
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:52,310
He's just too innocent.

1719
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:55,070
It's like...

1720
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,370
The innocence.

1721
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:59,190
Yeah, I'd pass.

1722
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:00,050
I'd pass.

1723
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:02,030
The metronome would just blow us all up anyway.

1724
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:02,870
Yeah, that's so true.

1725
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,010
I'd feed him applesauce.

1726
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:06,370
Applesauce.

1727
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:09,150
It just looks like he would really like applesauce.

1728
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:12,290
Pass.

1729
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:16,270
I think some people would say smash, but I'd say pass.

1730
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:19,790
Yeah, string about eight of those together and I'm smashing.

1731
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:20,350
Yeah, I was thinking that.

1732
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:21,190
I was like...

1733
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:24,430
I was thinking about the Takumura or whatever.

1734
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:26,230
And I was thinking about the fucking...

1735
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,270
The little monkey guys.

1736
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,810
And I was like...

1737
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,770
If she wanted to stick those up her ass...

1738
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:33,510
She's gonna want to stick a fucking electrode.

1739
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,570
Dude, the neighborhood power's gonna go out.

1740
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:38,250
Like, damn, what's going on tonight?

1741
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:39,690
Where's my power?

1742
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:42,110
And then it was just like...

1743
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:43,230
Incinerated Snuffy.

1744
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:45,930
And in the middle of the street...

1745
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,310
Died what she loves doing.

1746
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:52,090
Wait, Snuffy, are you muted?

1747
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,270
She's just...

1748
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:59,010
Thinking a little too hard about how her night would go.

1749
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:01,070
She's just imagining the scenario.

1750
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:04,870
Alright, tell us your dream scenario with Electrode.

1751
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:06,590
Um...

1752
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:10,850
Is this the first evolution?

1753
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,730
No, it's the second one.

1754
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,830
Oh my god.

1755
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,170
Okay, can you imagine...

1756
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,090
How do they level up?

1757
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:19,110
Please tell me where the stone is based on.

1758
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:20,230
It's like level 36 or something.

1759
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,130
Dude, I'm just saying, string them together, like I said, okay?

1760
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,490
Then they all evolve at the same time.

1761
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:27,850
Midway through.

1762
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:30,790
Oh my god.

1763
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:32,670
Oh my god.

1764
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:33,970
They just gain XP.

1765
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:37,050
Like, you know, okay, this is my idea.

1766
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:40,030
You give all of them EXP share.

1767
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,550
I can't.

1768
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,190
Absolute cinema.

1769
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,330
There's rare candies all around the room.

1770
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:48,350
EXP share.

1771
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:51,390
I'm frantically unwrapping the wrappers.

1772
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:52,350
What do I do?

1773
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:52,930
Shovel them up.

1774
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,550
I can't.

1775
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:56,790
Eat up my children.

1776
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:04,270
You are the reason Team Plasma exists.

1777
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:07,890
You are the reason why they exist.

1778
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:11,710
You are a problem to Pokemon society.

1779
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:15,790
We were never the heroes.

1780
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:19,070
I feel like we just posed together.

1781
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:20,510
It was like Team...

1782
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:23,390
Team Plasma was right.

1783
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:25,270
Team Plasma, yeah.

1784
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,190
We got a sort of plasma.

1785
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:29,730
Oh, brother.

1786
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,650
It's your favorite guy.

1787
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:34,050
It's your favorite guy, now he's bigger.

1788
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:37,370
Do I read off if he's got anything that helps me out this time?

1789
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:39,210
Upgrades.

1790
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:43,270
Colossal.

1791
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:44,450
Colossal?

1792
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:46,570
Oh, your name is Colossal, huh?

1793
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:47,470
Yeah, with a col.

1794
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:49,950
He's 2.8 meters tall.

1795
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,730
AKA 9 feet tall.

1796
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:54,170
He's 685 pounds.

1797
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:56,210
Almost 700 pounds.

1798
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:02,130
He's gonna fucking kill you before anything happens.

1799
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:03,170
He's peaceful.

1800
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:04,610
He's usually peaceful.

1801
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:06,930
Just don't vandalize the mines.

1802
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,450
It doesn't matter.

1803
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:13,170
He can just fucking step on you and your internal organs are gone.

1804
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:19,670
If you invade its opponents, Colossal will vigorously shake its body, scattering coal from its smoldering back.

1805
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:24,530
How'd you do that?

1806
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,330
What was that?

1807
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:28,150
That was my raccoon reflex.

1808
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:29,890
You heard...

1809
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:32,710
What part did you read that triggered it?

1810
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,570
Something about the coal falling from his back.

1811
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:38,230
Yeah, I was like, there's a coal falling from his back.

1812
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:41,490
I want it to land on me and I'll be like, ow shit!

1813
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:47,110
Instead of candle wax, it's just 900 degree coals.

1814
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:49,150
Yeah, imagine the sparks.

1815
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:50,190
I'm smashing.

1816
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:53,630
Goodbye everybody.

1817
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,550
I'm just gonna kiss my fingers.

1818
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:56,930
See you later.

1819
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:58,510
Peace out!

1820
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,830
Die by doing what she loves.

1821
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,390
Pass.

1822
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,530
Pass.

1823
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,190
That's like...

1824
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:18,190
There's nothing there.

1825
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:23,170
You can use the ridges.

1826
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:25,850
Oh, like a washing machine.

1827
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:28,770
Yeah.

1828
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,010
Oh my god!

1829
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:32,370
Okay.

1830
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,210
Wait, what?

1831
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:37,770
Okay, I was curious.

1832
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:43,210
Genuinely, I was like, I know I got a good mind for this sort of thing, and I can just say anything I wanted to.

1833
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:45,290
But what is the thought here?

1834
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:46,990
Is there an appeal here?

1835
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:48,810
Pull up ye olde website.

1836
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:50,830
Ye olde website of times and times.

1837
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:53,190
There's not much.

1838
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:54,930
Maybe...

1839
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:55,970
Maybe ten?

1840
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,410
Ten examples?

1841
01:17:59,010 --> 01:17:59,530
Awful.

1842
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:00,750
Awful.

1843
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:01,990
Awful things.

1844
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:03,850
I'm so curious.

1845
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:05,410
What is it?

1846
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:06,330
I think...

1847
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,550
I think people just treat it pretty much...

1848
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:10,330
Just like a...

1849
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:13,050
Like a what?

1850
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:14,530
Like a what?

1851
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:16,250
I mean, it's an inappropriate word.

1852
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:18,150
What?

1853
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:21,330
What could be more inappropriate than what we've already said?

1854
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:23,230
Oh, well...

1855
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,190
I think people just use it as like an own-a-hole.

1856
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:27,310
Oh...

1857
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:28,770
Hmm...

1858
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,290
Literally, it's just like from behind.

1859
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:31,610
They just see like...

1860
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:33,930
I don't even see anything.

1861
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:34,850
It's just an orb.

1862
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:35,890
Exactly.

1863
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:37,030
But there's a hole there.

1864
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:38,730
Yeah, there's another hole in the back.

1865
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:39,710
There's another hole?

1866
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:41,330
I thought there was one hole.

1867
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,030
There's a hole behind it?

1868
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:44,470
No!

1869
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:50,390
I mean, there's two holes.

1870
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:54,030
I guess if you're a guy, you'd say smash, yeah?

1871
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:59,430
I'm gonna pass.

1872
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:00,390
I'm passing on him.

1873
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:01,350
I'm passing.

1874
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:04,230
Salmon is awaiting, though.

1875
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:08,550
I feel like using the ridges or its bodies is just more ethical.

1876
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:08,970
Okay, oh.

1877
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,350
Yeah, I think the...

1878
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:12,810
Oh no, he seems really angry.

1879
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:13,950
I don't know...

1880
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:18,430
How do you stick anything near that?

1881
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:19,890
He seems really mad.

1882
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,550
I'll say pass.

1883
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:23,590
I'll wait for his father.

1884
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:28,790
Alright, Rhyhorn.

1885
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:32,990
I know where Snuffy's gonna stand on this.

1886
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,990
I know exactly what part she's looking at.

1887
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,730
I don't.

1888
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:37,270
I don't.

1889
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:37,910
You don't?

1890
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:41,530
Wait, you don't?

1891
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:43,650
What are you looking at?

1892
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:45,490
What do you mean?

1893
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:47,450
Go ahead.

1894
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,530
What are you thinking?

1895
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:49,730
Just tell me.

1896
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:51,050
I can't see the vision.

1897
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:52,510
Can you explain it?

1898
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:55,530
I personally would say pass.

1899
01:19:55,950 --> 01:20:01,450
I was saying that I think Snuffy would say smash because...

1900
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:04,170
What did Snuffy say?

1901
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:09,590
I was just saying, you know, Rhyhorn and like...

1902
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:15,250
What part is there from his name that's just there?

1903
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:18,890
I guess.

1904
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:20,510
I mean, he's a walkie-talkie.

1905
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:22,290
That's uncool.

1906
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:27,250
Flaming hot 9000 degrees.

1907
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,790
What was it?

1908
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:32,890
That's like making love to a Harley Davidson.

1909
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:34,610
Is that really messed up, chat?

1910
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,990
All you had to do was just like...

1911
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:38,530
What was it called?

1912
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,370
Get like a...

1913
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,690
Get some sandpaper.

1914
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:44,690
You're gonna rough that shit up.

1915
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:45,470
I mean...

1916
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:50,510
I was gonna say make the horn less spiky.

1917
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:51,830
So...

1918
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:55,770
You're gonna sand down your Pokemon horn so you can...

1919
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:57,450
You're gonna...

1920
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:02,550
I'm gonna sand down my horn so I can...

1921
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:03,590
Relax.

1922
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:06,970
It's like you're cutting it off.

1923
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:08,610
I'm not like Team Rocket.

1924
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,370
Like I'm gonna cut off the horn or something.

1925
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:13,250
I'm not gonna cut it off, guys.

1926
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:18,770
We're gonna smooth it down with like those smooth turners or whatever.

1927
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:22,730
And then you like shape it too so that it's got ridges.

1928
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:28,070
Just imagine falling into like a Pokemon battle with somebody and they're like, go Rhyhorn!

1929
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,850
And you're like, dude, what's up with your Rhyhorn?

1930
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:34,990
And it's ridged and sanded down and you're just like...

1931
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,670
Dude, what's going on?

1932
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:38,150
You know like...

1933
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:40,230
You know those tumblers?

1934
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:42,030
Like rock tumbling?

1935
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:47,610
I'm gonna rock tumble my Rhyhorn down round.

1936
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:49,530
Make him round.

1937
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,690
Make him less round.

1938
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,570
Jesus!

1939
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:58,070
You might as well just like throw him into the ocean and let the ocean like...

1940
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:59,290
Smooth him down.

1941
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:00,410
Who would win?

1942
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:03,330
One Rhyhorn or one rock tumbler?

1943
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:06,550
We can polish it!

1944
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:07,890
It'll be nice and shiny!

1945
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:11,450
Yeah, just use rock polish on him like 500 times.

1946
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:13,650
Why don't you just put like a...

1947
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,930
I don't know, like a glove or something over it.

1948
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,550
Like a cover.

1949
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,930
You know like...

1950
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:21,050
Those like coffee mug holders?

1951
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,050
Get that, but like horn shaped.

1952
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:24,870
Like a beard cover?

1953
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:28,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but like, you know, in whatever shape you want.

1954
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:30,650
That's more ethical.

1955
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:33,790
I want to put like a giant Hulk fist over his toe.

1956
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:35,090
Hulk fist?

1957
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:35,570
Okay.

1958
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:41,750
If you wanted a Hulk fist, why don't you just give a Pokemon with a Hulk fist?

1959
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:43,330
Like a Machamp.

1960
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:45,090
Yeah, why don't you just...

1961
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:49,170
Why are you trying to turn Rhyhorn into something that Rhyhorn isn't?

1962
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,250
You're gonna hurt its feelings.

1963
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:53,850
I'm sorry, Rhyhorn.

1964
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,470
I guess it's not meant to be.

1965
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,190
She's modding the Rhyhorn to her like...

1966
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:03,290
To her wants.

1967
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:06,870
I'm not modding to my wants.

1968
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:10,870
I'm just giving the suggestion to Snuffy's wants.

1969
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:12,510
I can't.

1970
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:14,570
We keep putting this on me.

1971
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:15,490
No.

1972
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:17,650
What Snuffy wants.

1973
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:18,630
Right, I forgot.

1974
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:21,550
Look,

1975
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:28,770
see, there's the Hulk fist for you, Snuffy.

1976
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:29,930
There it is.

1977
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:31,210
That's a balloon.

1978
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,570
I mean, it's a softer version.

1979
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:35,850
It's like...

1980
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:37,010
I guess, yeah.

1981
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:38,150
It'd be softer.

1982
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,670
It's stretchier.

1983
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:43,750
I pass.

1984
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:44,530
Freak.

1985
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:47,290
This is like...

1986
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:49,370
I'm so confused.

1987
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:54,710
Like the obvious furry bait Pokemon you pass, but like a literal...

1988
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:57,270
Like a tub of coals.

1989
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:59,090
I don't understand.

1990
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:03,090
She just doesn't like goofy guys.

1991
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:03,790
I don't understand.

1992
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:07,250
She doesn't like goofy guys.

1993
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,830
She doesn't...

1994
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:09,510
I like goofy guys.

1995
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:11,690
Clearly not.

1996
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:15,750
I think you guys are trying to say he's goofy, but I feel like he's giving like...

1997
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:16,130
Freak.

1998
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:17,170
This isn't goofy.

1999
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:20,350
I wouldn't want my mom to leave me alone in the room with this guy.

2000
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:23,290
Look at his eyes.

2001
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:28,110
You know what they say about people whose pupils don't touch the top and bottom of their eyes?

2002
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:28,830
Oh, that's true.

2003
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:30,190
Psychopath.

2004
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:32,110
That thing is gonna beat me to death.

2005
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:34,470
He looks like...

2006
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,230
He looks like he's hiding something.

2007
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:39,150
It's the haircut.

2008
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:40,350
It's the bowl cut.

2009
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:40,650
Look at his teeth.

2010
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:41,210
Look at his smile.

2011
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:42,830
Nobody smiles like this.

2012
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:46,170
Anybody who's smiling forever like this is a freak.

2013
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:48,830
If we could change his haircut, what would you say?

2014
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:51,090
We just take him to the barbershop.

2015
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:52,050
We give him a freak bowl cut.

2016
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:52,450
I give him a fade.

2017
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,710
I give him a fade.

2018
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:56,710
I don't wanna look at him anymore.

2019
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:58,730
I'd say pass.

2020
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:01,170
I don't know, it's just too many hands.

2021
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,070
I'm curious, so maybe...

2022
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:05,130
I'll smash just for like the one time.

2023
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:06,830
It looks like an udder, dude.

2024
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:08,090
It looks like it's got three nipples.

2025
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,670
That's what's freaky about it.

2026
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:12,890
It's got six nipples?

2027
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:13,790
It doesn't have a thumb.

2028
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:16,150
It's six nipples.

2029
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:19,590
Imagine like...

2030
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:20,910
Imagine what?

2031
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:22,570
Nothing.

2032
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:25,430
We should just continue.

2033
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,350
Do you wanna suck on these hands?

2034
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:28,370
Yeah, he looks like man gum.

2035
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:30,590
No!

2036
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:35,010
What are they?

2037
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:36,550
Let's just settle this.

2038
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:40,550
What are the hands on Ambipom?

2039
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:43,450
I can't type.

2040
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:45,130
Ambipom.

2041
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,670
Wait, I see it now.

2042
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:51,010
I see what she thinks they are.

2043
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:54,170
Utters.

2044
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:57,390
Those are its utters.

2045
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:59,730
I don't think Baller's thinking of the answer.

2046
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:00,090
It says to eat.

2047
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:02,830
It definitely shucks nuts with its two tails.

2048
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:04,790
It rarely uses its arms.

2049
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:07,370
Oh, so they are like hands.

2050
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:11,830
They communicate by connecting their tails to those of others.

2051
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:13,470
Oh my god, they're like Davi!

2052
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,790
Yeah, they're like Davis!

2053
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:17,870
They like bind their hands.

2054
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,830
They're like... Is that how they bang?

2055
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:21,370
They just touch each other's hands?

2056
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:22,870
Touching tips.

2057
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:24,710
Oh my god, yeah, I can see that.

2058
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:25,690
They touch tips here.

2059
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:30,690
And then they can like self-pleasure by holding their own hand.

2060
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:32,830
Okay.

2061
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:37,330
But now, what if it held my hand?

2062
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:45,730
Are we entering like biological VR chat to like ERP in our minds?

2063
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:48,090
Is that what would happen?

2064
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:50,170
Pass.

2065
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:54,190
Oh my god!

2066
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:57,750
I freaking love Jump Love!

2067
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:03,630
Jump Love's cute, but there's just like pollen and also the fact it's just a round orb.

2068
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:05,510
Pass.

2069
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:06,770
One orb.

2070
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:08,250
Pass.

2071
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:11,010
What about you, Snuffy?

2072
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:14,930
I'm reading the Pokedex entries on Jump Love.

2073
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,310
Are you trying to convince yourself?

2074
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:21,070
I just wanna know.

2075
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,230
Maybe there's something there.

2076
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:31,410
It says, blown by seasonal winds, it circles the globe scattering cotton spores as it goes.

2077
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,370
Beware of its cotton.

2078
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:37,210
If you accidentally breathe them in, you'll be wracked with coughs and itchiness.

2079
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:37,810
Oh my god.

2080
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,710
That's not fun.

2081
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:40,250
Yeah, pass.

2082
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:42,190
It's just allergy season everyday.

2083
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:44,030
Yeah, I'll pass.

2084
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:45,190
I just wanna be its friends.

2085
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:45,850
Pass.

2086
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,090
What is this?

2087
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:51,630
It's wheezing, but galar form.

2088
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:53,750
Pass.

2089
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:57,390
You sit on that thing, it'll turn you into a balloon, but like full of gas.

2090
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:58,710
I'll inflate you!

2091
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:02,650
That thing is a bong.

2092
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:06,110
This thing is like the Brat Factory.

2093
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:06,790
No!

2094
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:09,790
Holy...

2095
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:12,970
That came out of your mouth.

2096
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:15,530
Pass.

2097
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:16,950
Missing.

2098
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:18,030
Pass.

2099
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:22,110
I'll smash my good lord.

2100
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:23,930
Look how bad he is.

2101
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:25,530
Yeah, he looks like a bad boy.

2102
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:26,990
Oh my god.

2103
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,490
What was that?

2104
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,130
I was just making eye contact with it.

2105
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:34,430
Hey.

2106
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:38,550
Look at those bedroom eyes.

2107
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:39,770
He wants me so bad.

2108
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:42,990
He's like, you mean tonight?

2109
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:45,230
My bed, my room.

2110
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:46,730
Oh my god.

2111
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,650
What are even the things on his chest?

2112
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:49,210
What is that?

2113
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:52,310
Ridges for my pleasure.

2114
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:57,990
They're handlebars.

2115
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:00,870
They're for better gripage.

2116
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:13,070
Oh, when this Pokémon sounds as if it's strumming a guitar, it's actually clawing at the protrusions on its chest to generate electricity.

2117
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:16,010
I bet he's got groupies for sure.

2118
01:29:16,570 --> 01:29:17,570
Oh, you...

2119
01:29:17,570 --> 01:29:21,810
It says as it scatters toxic sweat, it emits electricity.

2120
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:26,610
A melody that sounds like it came from a guitar reverberates through the surrounding area.

2121
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:28,610
Oh, so he plays music in the bedroom.

2122
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:32,490
Yeah, you're gonna be making music for sure.

2123
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:33,630
Oh, he's gonna give you...

2124
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:36,050
Oh, someone's like, he'll give you shocks in bed.

2125
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:37,470
Yeah.

2126
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:38,850
Damn.

2127
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:41,590
Let me put my ponytail up.

2128
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:44,570
He's like, can he play Wonderwall?

2129
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:46,910
I can't.

2130
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:47,770
Not this again.

2131
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:53,670
I'd say...

2132
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:54,110
You know what?

2133
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:55,050
I can see it.

2134
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:55,850
I can see...

2135
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:56,970
I can see the vision.

2136
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:58,530
I'll say smash.

2137
01:29:58,610 --> 01:29:59,130
I agree.

2138
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:00,930
Pass.

2139
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:05,930
A creature.

2140
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:07,850
Pass.

2141
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:10,410
He looks shy and cute though.

2142
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,910
He's like, if only you could give me a chance, you know?

2143
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,850
I can rock your world.

2144
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:17,310
I can rock your world.

2145
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:18,850
Just give me a chance.

2146
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:27,910
Wait, why are you smash, Snuffy?

2147
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:30,930
You're giving him a pity smash.

2148
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:32,490
No, it's not a pity smash.

2149
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:33,950
That's my type.

2150
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:38,910
No, the bashful...

2151
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:40,390
Bashful shyness, dude.

2152
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:44,050
So cute, but then I bet like, freak in the bed, you know?

2153
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:46,270
Pass.

2154
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:52,010
Some of y'all in the chat are freaks.

2155
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:54,730
Pass.

2156
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:55,990
That's like a kitty cat.

2157
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:56,630
Meow.

2158
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,750
Do not touch my Volpix.

2159
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:01,050
I will kill you.

2160
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,510
Wait, there's the brother.

2161
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:10,830
Snuffy.

2162
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:12,750
The older brother.

2163
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:16,810
What's the difference between him and Bulbasaur?

2164
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:18,750
Bulbasaur is so much nicer than this.

2165
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:19,990
Ivysaur is mean looking.

2166
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:22,630
I feel like he'd give me a poison ivy.

2167
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:25,770
Yeah, he's very snapping turtle-esque.

2168
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:27,050
Exactly.

2169
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:28,290
Pass.

2170
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:29,510
Pass.

2171
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:30,590
Pass.

2172
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:34,870
If any of y'all smash, you're going to hell.

2173
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:38,250
Pass.

2174
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:43,370
Like, what is this body made out of?

2175
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:46,970
What is that?

2176
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:48,950
I always thought it was like, glutinous.

2177
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:51,030
It does look glutinous.

2178
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:51,590
It does.

2179
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:52,450
It looks like a mochi.

2180
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:55,010
Like, he's all squishy and stuff.

2181
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:55,670
Yeah, yeah.

2182
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:57,590
I can mold her.

2183
01:31:58,230 --> 01:31:58,930
I'mma pass.

2184
01:31:59,070 --> 01:32:00,570
Birds kinda scare me most of the time.

2185
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,710
I'd say pass, too.

2186
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:08,030
Yeah, pass.

2187
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:09,510
Fidgeot, though?

2188
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:11,350
He's like an asshole, too, right?

2189
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:13,030
There are no new assholes.

2190
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:16,810
I think Ash's Fidgeot was pretty loyal.

2191
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:19,190
Obama Snow.

2192
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:22,570
I really like the way this Pokemon sounds.

2193
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:23,690
I'm gonna be honest with you.

2194
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:23,910
Wait, what does he sound like?

2195
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:24,830
Obama!

2196
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:25,470
Obama!

2197
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:26,910
Obama!

2198
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:29,650
Hello, everybody.

2199
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:37,150
He makes a really cool guitar noise.

2200
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:38,110
I don't know why.

2201
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:39,610
I just always thought he sounded so cool.

2202
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:41,210
Yeah, yeah!

2203
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:44,110
What's his Pokedex entry?

2204
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:48,490
He pretends to be a Christmas tree, and then he gives you a little spook.

2205
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:50,250
Wait, really?

2206
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:51,730
No, I made that up.

2207
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:55,450
Honestly, it sounds like Pokemon!

2208
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:00,630
This is the Pokedex entry.

2209
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:03,870
We've done 41 Pokemon already.

2210
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:04,990
Oh my god.

2211
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:08,070
We've sure done them all, right?

2212
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,090
Wait.

2213
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:12,550
My fellow, you know this.

2214
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:18,410
Blankets, wide areas in snow by whipping up blizzards.

2215
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:21,510
What?

2216
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:27,430
I wanna hang a star at the top of that Christmas tree.

2217
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:29,350
I'm gonna pass.

2218
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:30,090
I'm just passing.

2219
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:33,290
I wish I could say that I could...

2220
01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:34,810
He reminds me of Zoidberg.

2221
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:36,770
It just sounds so ouchy.

2222
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:40,030
Yeah, he looks like Zoidberg-ass.

2223
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:43,730
He even has his claws up, just like him.

2224
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:45,990
Big meat claws.

2225
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:47,990
Oh my god, it's Doki.

2226
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:50,010
Pass.

2227
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:51,330
Oh my god!

2228
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:53,590
Pass.

2229
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:58,830
I feel like he'll forget where he is, too.

2230
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:02,070
Yeah.

2231
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:04,010
I feel like there's not...

2232
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,330
There's like nothing...

2233
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:07,230
And he's gonna get a headache.

2234
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:09,450
What if he's just like, ouch.

2235
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:13,990
Oh my god.

2236
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:16,690
Someone get him some Exeggerant.

2237
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,860
The fuck is that?

2238
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,700
What the fuck is that?

2239
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,280
I don't even know.

2240
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:27,820
What is that?

2241
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:29,480
What is that?

2242
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,240
It says he's trapped.

2243
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:34,880
This is literally Vor.

2244
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,380
He's like eating himself.

2245
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:38,900
Or 12th length.

2246
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:42,080
How did that happen to him?

2247
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,460
Uncut Tango Snake.

2248
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:51,180
When it contracts its body, it's over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose.

2249
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,960
Whatever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened.

2250
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,640
Okay, that's even worse.

2251
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,020
Don't let it run out of sand!

2252
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,600
Don't let it run out of sand!

2253
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:00,800
It gets depression.

2254
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:01,740
It's a little sad.

2255
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,760
It's like, yeah, but you don't want sand...

2256
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,920
Okay, but you don't want sand to get anywhere, though.

2257
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:08,860
That's not fun.

2258
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:09,800
Yeah, that sounds awful.

2259
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:15,720
This unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand out of its sand sack more efficiently.

2260
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,940
It just starts blasting sand.

2261
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,560
What is that?

2262
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,060
What is that?

2263
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:26,180
What is a sand sack?

2264
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:29,340
Why is he blasting out of a sand sack?

2265
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,200
Is that, like, his nose?

2266
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:32,780
What am I thinking?

2267
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:35,680
What does it look like when it's blasting?

2268
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,380
Does it just, like, undulate it out?

2269
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,500
Show me what it looks like when it's blasting.

2270
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,420
It really is pocket sand, dude!

2271
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,500
And where was he storing that, Chat?

2272
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:48,380
Where was he storing it?

2273
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,840
Oh my God.

2274
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:54,940
That's just...

2275
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:55,880
BPD Pikachu.

2276
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:57,520
Pass.

2277
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:00,600
Yeah, pass.

2278
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:01,960
Pass.

2279
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,480
Come back!

2280
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:05,400
Oh, Greninja?

2281
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,900
Come on, Snuffy, that me up.

2282
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,580
Oh my God, yes, yes.

2283
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:09,880
That's right.

2284
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:13,500
There's nothing about this Pokémon that hasn't just been, like...

2285
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:14,840
Mhm.

2286
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,700
I mean, like...

2287
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:19,840
He uses his tongue as a scarf.

2288
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:22,080
You ever see Ash Greninja, man?

2289
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,700
Okay, Ash Greninja...

2290
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:24,860
Yeah, I can... Yeah.

2291
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,320
Why is he such a baddie?

2292
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,720
He's so fucking sick.

2293
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:33,860
I want this thing to, like...

2294
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:35,700
go out one end and, like, through the mouth.

2295
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:36,900
I get it!

2296
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,660
Greninja in the front, Grovyle in the back.

2297
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,580
Oh my...

2298
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,460
Are they both frogs?

2299
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:46,020
No.

2300
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,660
No, it's a reptile.

2301
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:50,540
The other one's a reptile.

2302
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,400
This one's a...

2303
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,840
A frog is in the...

2304
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:55,960
Wait, is a frog a reptile?

2305
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,220
We can make a new species.

2306
01:36:59,440 --> 01:36:59,680
Wait.

2307
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,200
Greninja.

2308
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,540
Let me read Greninja.

2309
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,700
This Pokémon is...

2310
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:06,620
4 feet 11.

2311
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,200
It weighs 88 pounds.

2312
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,400
Skinny King.

2313
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,080
It creates throwing stars out of compressed water.

2314
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:18,480
When it spins them and throws them at high speeds, this star can split metal in two.

2315
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:23,160
It appears and vanishes with ninja's grace.

2316
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:28,960
It toys with its enemies using swift movements while slicing them with throwing stars of sharpest water.

2317
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:31,520
Tell me about...

2318
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,940
It makes a shuriken out of mucus excreted from its eyes.

2319
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:36,740
No.

2320
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:37,160
Alright.

2321
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:39,440
So it's around its eyes.

2322
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:40,600
Okay.

2323
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,140
Extra lube, as they say.

2324
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,120
Smash.

2325
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:55,120
That was like self-lubricating.

2326
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,500
Oh my god.

2327
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:56,960
Smash.

2328
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,220
Doki, you see it, right?

2329
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,180
You see the vision, right?

2330
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:01,960
I see it.

2331
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,360
I see it, so...

2332
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:08,520
I unfortunately see it, so I'll say smash.

2333
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:09,600
Yes!

2334
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:13,800
Necrozma.

2335
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:15,760
Is that a legendary?

2336
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:16,340
What is that?

2337
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:24,440
It's like an evil legendary in the same game that the first Pokemon, the Solgaleo.

2338
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,460
He's like the enemy to those guys.

2339
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:28,960
There's just too many.

2340
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,380
It's just too sharp everywhere.

2341
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:31,420
There's too many edges.

2342
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:41,360
In the game, he ends up suckling those Pokemon, the Solgaleo and Moolala and fusing with them into an ultimate fusion form of evil.

2343
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,200
Wait, they're evil?

2344
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:45,180
This one is.

2345
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:53,200
He defeats them in battle and takes their power and infuses them and they fuse together into Ultra Necrozma.

2346
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,520
Pass.

2347
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:57,280
I don't know.

2348
01:38:57,380 --> 01:38:58,240
What can you do?

2349
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:02,140
It says, light is apparently the source of its energy.

2350
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:07,080
It has extraordinarily vicious disposition and is constantly firing off laser beams.

2351
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:11,520
It looks somehow pained as it rages around in search of light.

2352
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:12,960
So he has anger issues.

2353
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,220
Oh, I can fix him.

2354
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:21,500
He won't be angry no more when I'm with him.

2355
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:24,180
It needs light to survive and goes on a rampage seeking it out.

2356
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:26,600
Its laser beams will cut anything to pieces.

2357
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:30,420
It is in pain right now.

2358
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:36,860
I'm gonna come up to it and grab it by its face with a single palm, like, babe, this isn't you.

2359
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:37,960
Come on.

2360
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,360
Snap out of it.

2361
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:41,340
You're better than this.

2362
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:42,840
Look me in the eyes.

2363
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,900
Just focus on me.

2364
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:49,020
Mr. Mime.

2365
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:50,400
Galarian.

2366
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,440
I mean, like, Asher's mom likes him.

2367
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,400
Yeah, she does.

2368
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:58,300
There's a reason why she never remarried.

2369
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,600
I can't.

2370
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:13,460
If you watch the Sun and Moon, like, first episode of the anime, there's, like, a scene where Asher's mom is sitting in a golf cart with Mr. Mime and Mr. Mime's hand is, like, resting on her inner thigh.

2371
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:14,600
Wait, really?

2372
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:15,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2373
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:17,900
I've seen it.

2374
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,640
I know, like, she takes him everywhere.

2375
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:23,460
Like, it's in every vacation.

2376
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,920
Like, she's just...

2377
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,780
That's Asher's stepdad.

2378
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:31,800
He knows it.

2379
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,620
There's a reason why his dad never came back.

2380
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:42,020
What are the entries for Galarian Mr. Mime?

2381
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:45,320
Yeah, but what's the difference between the normal Mr. Mime and Galarian Mr. Mime?

2382
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,440
I guess it'll be...

2383
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,500
I don't know how to read.

2384
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,280
Hold on, let me see if I can find his...

2385
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:51,980
Pokédex entry.

2386
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,640
Do the shoes stay on?

2387
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,840
I think that is his flesh.

2388
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,220
I think that's part of him.

2389
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:00,460
I don't think they're shoes.

2390
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,960
It says, oh my god, the broadness of its hands may be no coincidence.

2391
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:08,380
Many scientists believe its palms became enlarged specifically for pantomiming.

2392
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,380
And it's, uh...

2393
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:13,300
It radiates chillness from the bottom of its feet.

2394
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:15,640
It'll spend the whole day tap dancing on a frozen floor.

2395
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,280
Just a chill dude.

2396
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,800
He's just a chill guy.

2397
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,020
Well, I feel like it'd be really annoying, though.

2398
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,080
I feel like that'd be really annoying.

2399
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,060
I'd be like, get a real job.

2400
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:28,520
I'd be like...

2401
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:29,760
I can't.

2402
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,600
Go to college.

2403
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:32,980
Do something with your life.

2404
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,940
Yeah, I'd be like...

2405
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:36,900
Get a real job.

2406
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,340
Stop being a deadbeat.

2407
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:40,900
So you won't smash him because he doesn't have a real job?

2408
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,020
And he pursues an artistic career?

2409
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:46,260
I just...

2410
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:46,760
I don't know.

2411
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:49,180
I just feel like, you know, all he does is tap dancing.

2412
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,520
He's so chill.

2413
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:53,680
He probably wards off your hater mentality.

2414
01:41:55,380 --> 01:42:00,780
You're having, like, a serious argument over divorce, and he just, like, keeps miming and pretending he's stuck in a box?

2415
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:01,640
He's just tap dancing.

2416
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,360
It was like, you don't support me in my career!

2417
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:07,520
I'd be like...

2418
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,660
He pretends to walk down the stairs.

2419
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:11,660
I'd be like, what career?!

2420
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,780
All you do is dance!

2421
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:18,760
I'm passing.

2422
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:19,760
Pass.

2423
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:22,240
Oh, pass.

2424
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:23,480
That's just a larva.

2425
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:24,920
Oh, yes.

2426
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,200
Yeah.

2427
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:28,060
He's too cute.

2428
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:28,980
Oh, my lord.

2429
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:31,380
What is that thing at the bottom?

2430
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,680
Is that where it comes out?

2431
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:37,800
It's actually...

2432
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,800
He is...

2433
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:46,260
It breathes through a hole in its tail while it burns through an internal fire.

2434
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:52,580
Using its very hot flame-covered tongue, they burn through Durant's steel body and consume their insides.

2435
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:55,060
That's actually what it says.

2436
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:56,440
That's kind of messed up.

2437
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,820
That was actually the Pokemon we saw earlier.

2438
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:01,940
It eats that thing alive from the inside, is what it literally just said.

2439
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,340
So he'll handle the pest problems.

2440
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:11,280
Yeah, he's an anteater, but he has internal piping that's pumping hot air inside of him.

2441
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:13,840
Yeah, so does he always have to do that?

2442
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:15,300
Like, blow hot air out?

2443
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,260
Oh, my god.

2444
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:22,540
Because if he has to do that all the time, I'd say pass.

2445
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:28,820
It just says it breathes through a hole in its tail while it burns with an internal fire.

2446
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:29,520
That's all it says.

2447
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:32,940
He has to always blow that shit out.

2448
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:33,480
Pass.

2449
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,360
That's just inconvenient.

2450
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,120
Pass.

2451
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,520
What the fuck is that?

2452
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:43,880
Where did this one came out?

2453
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,220
This looks like someone's OC gone normal.

2454
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:53,880
What is this?

2455
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:54,700
What is on the top?

2456
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:58,520
Is this a tumor?

2457
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,800
Did it, like, stop growing?

2458
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,840
There's a tumor on top of the shell.

2459
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,740
I think I know it's, like, actual animal.

2460
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,240
A turtle?

2461
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:11,720
Yeah, it's based off of a turtle, but it's not a natural turtle.

2462
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,540
It's, like, a fish.

2463
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,460
Oh, it's the little soft-nosed one.

2464
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,780
Oh, that's a long-nosed little thing.

2465
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:19,360
Wait, why is it, like, sex themed, though?

2466
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,840
Aphrodite, if she was a weird fish turtle?

2467
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,120
That's so true.

2468
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:27,080
Like, why did they, like...

2469
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:28,340
Wait, she has platforms.

2470
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:29,820
Barbie did it.

2471
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:30,160
Oh, my God.

2472
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:33,080
This is its other form?

2473
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:38,380
I don't know why it differs between turning into a soft-nosed turtle fish or, like, a diva.

2474
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:39,900
Some sort of, like, oni.

2475
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:42,760
We did it!

2476
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:43,440
It's a girl!

2477
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:45,240
You don't have to keep...

2478
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:48,140
There's, like, a heart nose.

2479
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:49,100
There's a ear.

2480
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:50,120
There's another nose.

2481
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:54,900
Its Pokédex entry says, When it flies to this land from across the sea, the bitter winter comes to an end.

2482
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:59,400
According to the legend, this Pokémon's lore gives rise to the budding of fresh life.

2483
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:08,980
A different guise from its feminine human form, the cloud that descends upon those who treat any form with disrespect, it means outraffle, ruthless punishment.

2484
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:09,760
What?

2485
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,080
I'm scared.

2486
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:13,940
That does not look like a Pokémon anymore.

2487
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:15,460
What is that?

2488
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:23,140
That just looks like those OC creators with those, like, random Pokémon generators where they just smash some random things together and there's, like, that's a Pokémon.

2489
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:24,240
Pass, by the way.

2490
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,620
I'm not being a Sandshrew.

2491
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:29,380
Sandshrew is, like, the coolest Pokémon in the world.

2492
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,480
He's just gonna roll into a ball because he's scared.

2493
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:35,440
He's, like, Yeah, he's, like...

2494
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:35,980
Don't care.

2495
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:36,740
Defense curl, sand attack.

2496
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:37,440
Don't care.

2497
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,840
Whoa, you're just gonna skip him?

2498
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,140
We didn't even get to say smash, dude.

2499
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,080
For what?

2500
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:44,840
Sandshrew?

2501
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,140
What's your problem with Sandshrew, dude?

2502
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,160
Why do you wanna smash Sandshrew?

2503
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:51,000
He's just gonna curl up and die!

2504
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,220
He's cool.

2505
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,440
That's what defense curl and sand attack.

2506
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,080
He missed and also defense curl L.

2507
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:00,460
Also for alligator?

2508
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:01,860
Oh my lord.

2509
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:04,160
I feel like he just eats you.

2510
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:07,140
He looks like he could be in the FNAF universe.

2511
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:09,900
Yeah, he could be, like, Foxy from FNAF.

2512
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,840
He's a crocodile.

2513
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:12,100
You ever see a crocodile?

2514
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:13,740
They just sit there with their mouths open.

2515
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:15,200
That's kind of just what they'd be doing.

2516
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:16,500
Yeah, and then they eat you.

2517
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,060
I'm gonna walk up to, like, in Florida.

2518
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:23,060
I'll be like, this is kind of like FNAF.

2519
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,100
This is literally FNAF.

2520
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,860
This is the bite of 87 right there.

2521
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:29,060
You're gonna put your head...

2522
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,180
This guy looks like Freddy Fazbear.

2523
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:37,040
Freddy Fazbear, man.

2524
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,160
Pass.

2525
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,580
I feel like he'd just kill you.

2526
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,700
Smash, smash, smash.

2527
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:42,720
Oh my god, smash.

2528
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:44,760
I would smash because, what's his name?

2529
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:45,520
Monty Gator?

2530
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,080
He's such a baddie.

2531
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,260
Montgomery Gator.

2532
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:49,620
Montgomery Gator?

2533
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:51,220
That's why I see the vision.

2534
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,100
Oh, what is this?

2535
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:56,320
Oh, is this, like, from the Esper or something?

2536
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:58,300
Is it the Esper evolution line?

2537
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:01,260
Meowstic.

2538
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:02,560
Pass.

2539
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:03,740
Stares at you.

2540
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:07,440
Esper stare.

2541
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:12,560
I mean, I can tell where you can smash, but, like, pass.

2542
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:22,660
So instead of the orange school rat, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10 ton truck into dust.

2543
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:25,540
Oh, so she'll kill you before anything happens.

2544
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:29,720
I want her to hypnotize me into, like, falling in love with it.

2545
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:30,940
You know?

2546
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:34,120
So, like, but then will she kill you after?

2547
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:35,640
Like, you're, like, a prey to her?

2548
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:36,580
Or, like, actually?

2549
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:38,540
I don't know.

2550
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:43,540
This article says, females are a bit more selfish and aggressive than males.

2551
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:47,480
If they don't get what they want, they will torment you with their psychic ability.

2552
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:53,300
It will cause you psychic damage if you don't please your female bro.

2553
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:55,000
That's awesome!

2554
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,340
It hurt itself in its confusion.

2555
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:04,740
Oh my god, someone's like, oh my god, yonder, right there.

2556
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:06,480
That's crazy.

2557
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:08,920
Yeah, someone's like, yeah, that's a smash.

2558
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:10,740
Yeah, it's like, I can...

2559
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:12,340
They're like, I can fix her.

2560
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,880
I can fix her.

2561
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:17,240
I want her to use me.

2562
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:21,480
Pass.

2563
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,920
I'll use it to mine Bitcoin.

2564
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,520
What is this?

2565
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:27,840
That's a...

2566
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:29,940
a sideguard.

2567
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,000
That's Norden Antivirus.

2568
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:34,880
Yeah, that's Norden Antivirus right there.

2569
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:35,640
Yeah.

2570
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:40,100
It says that this thing is a generation of cells.

2571
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:42,880
So it's like 1000 different life forms.

2572
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:44,060
Oh, shit.

2573
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:45,340
It's like DNA?

2574
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:46,800
It wants to die so bad.

2575
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:49,620
The NVIDIA Pokemon.

2576
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:51,160
The NVIDIA.

2577
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:53,960
Pass?

2578
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:55,040
I don't really know what this is.

2579
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,120
Like a...

2580
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:57,120
It's like a snake.

2581
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:01,080
Zygarde 100%.

2582
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:01,840
What is that?

2583
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:04,320
Oh, it's a different form.

2584
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:06,720
Yeah, it turns into... Wait, it's kind of a fatty.

2585
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:09,540
Wait, we need to look up Zygarde 100%.

2586
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:11,800
Wait, post a picture in the post a picture in the Discord.

2587
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:13,640
I got you, I got you.

2588
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:19,640
It's like a Digimon.

2589
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:24,460
Wait, he's like NVIDIA Optimus Prime.

2590
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:25,860
Yeah, he's like RTX on.

2591
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:28,320
What's happening to me?

2592
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:29,740
He looks like a transformer.

2593
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:33,560
Yeah, it looks like he's gonna do the transformer sound effect right now.

2594
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:35,040
I was already kind of into it for the worm vibe.

2595
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,320
That must feel sensational.

2596
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,040
It also has...

2597
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,920
Also has what?

2598
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:44,700
Snuffy.

2599
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:45,620
It's another form.

2600
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:47,740
Yeah, what's the other form?

2601
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:48,380
Show me.

2602
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:49,120
Oh, brother.

2603
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,660
Oh, brother.

2604
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:56,020
It resembles some sort of...

2605
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:57,380
Oh my god.

2606
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,780
I know people in chat are gonna say smash.

2607
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,740
I hate it.

2608
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:04,720
Oh, brother.

2609
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,500
She looks like she can step on you.

2610
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:09,440
She looks like she is going to step on you.

2611
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:14,080
I call you like a dirty boy.

2612
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:18,180
She'd make you kiss her heels.

2613
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:19,920
Yeah, I see that.

2614
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:21,920
She wouldn't let you go anywhere above the knee.

2615
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,840
Oh my god.

2616
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:29,820
I'm pass.

2617
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:30,420
What?

2618
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:31,940
Pheromosa.

2619
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:35,540
Alright, you know what?

2620
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,580
I gotta pull it up.

2621
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:37,940
Let me read this.

2622
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,440
The Pokedex entry has to go wild for this.

2623
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:42,760
Pheromosa.

2624
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:44,360
We gotta know the lore.

2625
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:45,920
I wanna know how bad it is.

2626
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:48,100
How much of a baddie she is.

2627
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,140
I wanna know what she's gonna do to me.

2628
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:53,400
Oh, they did it dirty with the explanation.

2629
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:58,560
It just says one of the dangerous ultra beasts that has been spotted running across the land at terrific speeds.

2630
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,060
Oh, she's fast.

2631
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:08,520
Although it's an alien to this world and a danger here, it's apparently a common organism in the world that it normally lives.

2632
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:09,340
That's all it says.

2633
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,940
I feel like we're all just staring at them.

2634
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:14,240
Because you couldn't write what you wanted to, right?

2635
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,060
Yeah.

2636
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:20,420
It's like in the leaks, guys.

2637
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:21,480
It's in the Pokemon.

2638
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:24,740
The hidden entry of Pheromosa.

2639
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:24,880
Pheromosa.

2640
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:29,100
It's codename is UB02 Beauty.

2641
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:30,860
Okay.

2642
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:32,860
Ubisoft.

2643
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,900
She's literally a beast.

2644
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:37,960
They codenamed the Pokemon Beauty.

2645
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:38,780
Ubi-boobi.

2646
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:39,660
Ubi-doobi.

2647
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:40,720
Scooby-dooby.

2648
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,620
I'm a pass.

2649
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:44,120
I don't think I can handle her.

2650
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:46,800
She's 5'11".

2651
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:47,820
55 pounds.

2652
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:49,980
Damn, she's tall.

2653
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:51,700
And skinny.

2654
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:52,500
Pass.

2655
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:55,040
I want to beat that thing with a brick.

2656
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,880
What the fuck did he do to you?

2657
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:58,500
Why?

2658
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:00,620
Stupid.

2659
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:01,500
Stupid ass.

2660
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:02,440
What did he do?

2661
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,200
Is it because of the way he looks?

2662
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:07,880
I want to hit him with my car as if he's a bugger.

2663
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:09,700
What the?

2664
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,540
He's not going to know winning for this, guys.

2665
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:13,960
He looks stupid.

2666
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,800
He looks dumb.

2667
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:16,220
He's cheering you on.

2668
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:18,080
He wants you to win.

2669
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,460
He wants you to win.

2670
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,640
I don't need your fucking pity vote.

2671
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:23,000
Get out of my face.

2672
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:25,760
He's just a little guy.

2673
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:27,520
He's trying to be a fun guy.

2674
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:28,860
You got this.

2675
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,080
You got this, Snuffy.

2676
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:39,760
Snuffy, what are you doing with the car?

2677
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:50,060
Like his rock dusk.

2678
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,040
Pass.

2679
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:02,000
Why aren't you guys saying anything?

2680
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:07,840
Why aren't you guys saying anything?

2681
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:13,040
That's a cool Pokemon.

2682
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:17,220
Smash or pass, guys?

2683
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:19,460
Smash or pass?

2684
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:20,840
What did you say?

2685
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:22,360
I said pass.

2686
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:24,060
Yeah.

2687
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:36,920
I think I hit you off there.

2688
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:37,120
Sorry.

2689
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:37,280
What?

2690
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,640
Come on, guys.

2691
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,140
What is it?

2692
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:45,420
It's...

2693
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:46,900
I just...

2694
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:47,780
He's orange.

2695
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:49,780
He's orange.

2696
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,160
I like the other form.

2697
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:53,520
Oh, yeah?

2698
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,100
I like the other form.

2699
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,240
I would...

2700
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:07,940
Yeah.

2701
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:11,560
Alright.

2702
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:12,700
Let's just...

2703
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:14,620
Alright, Haunter.

2704
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,740
I mean, he does get freaky with his tongue.

2705
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:21,140
Does this one do the tongue thing?

2706
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:22,340
Yeah, they all do the tongue thing.

2707
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:23,060
All of them.

2708
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:24,660
They always do the...

2709
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:25,000
Oh, yeah.

2710
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:25,780
Ash's Haunter.

2711
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:27,220
Oh, yeah.

2712
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:28,720
Ash's Haunter was freaky.

2713
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:29,660
Oh, my God.

2714
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:29,880
Yeah.

2715
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:31,520
Wait.

2716
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:33,220
Get me that Haunter specifically.

2717
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:36,320
Specifically Ash's Haunter.

2718
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,120
You're breaking into his PC.

2719
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:42,560
He was up to no good.

2720
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:45,420
He was not satisfied being Ash's Pokemon.

2721
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:46,340
That's for sure.

2722
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,140
He wanted to be Sabrina's Pokemon.

2723
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:52,140
God, so do I.

2724
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:59,120
Sabrina and all her Alakazams.

2725
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:01,220
There was something going on.

2726
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,360
I get you, Sabrina.

2727
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:05,600
I get you.

2728
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,400
I'm passing.

2729
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,340
I'm smashing.

2730
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:11,800
Slowking.

2731
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:13,220
He can talk.

2732
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:15,320
Yeah, he can talk.

2733
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:19,840
He really is the one Pokemon that can talk.

2734
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,500
Is there any other Pokemon that can talk?

2735
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,460
Like Meowth.

2736
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:25,120
Like Telepathy.

2737
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:26,780
Meowth talks.

2738
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:28,620
A lot of the psychic ones can.

2739
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:33,260
Yeah, but Meowth is like the only one in the Meowth family that talks.

2740
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,600
Can all Slowkings talk?

2741
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:36,460
Yeah, because they're like really smart.

2742
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:38,200
And they use Telepathy to talk.

2743
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:41,220
Lucario can canonically talk too.

2744
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:42,080
Oh, yeah.

2745
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:43,040
Telepathy.

2746
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,560
Meowth learned to speak though.

2747
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:47,800
But that's just in the anime.

2748
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:50,600
Meowth fell in love with another Meowth.

2749
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:53,480
And then he was like, oh, she'll be so impressed if I start talking.

2750
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,500
And then he got cooked by a Persian.

2751
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:55,260
Yeah.

2752
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:56,960
I remember this.

2753
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:59,500
Yeah, and then he was like, I'll never fall in love again.

2754
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:04,040
All female Meowths are like bad or some shit.

2755
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:09,100
And then he starts falling in love with other cat Pokemon.

2756
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:10,480
Literally.

2757
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:13,220
He's like, I'm never dating my own kind again.

2758
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:19,920
This one says, This Pokemon is so famed for its intellect that a proverb still persists in some regions.

2759
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,580
When in doubt, ask Slowking.

2760
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:27,260
For this one says, It's constantly coming up with new ideas that would change the world.

2761
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:30,820
But as soon as it hits upon a new idea, it forgets it.

2762
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,460
Oh, so he's stupid.

2763
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:34,760
And he doesn't...

2764
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:36,100
He's just an ideas man.

2765
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:38,900
He's a genius guy with the intellect.

2766
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:40,300
They're like the memory of a bird.

2767
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:42,200
Sorry, bird joke again.

2768
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:43,500
I already lost it.

2769
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:45,680
Damn it.

2770
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:47,840
He could have found the cure for cancer.

2771
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:51,060
Oh my god.

2772
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:55,880
We have to put him under scrutiny and be like, Slowking, please remember.

2773
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,070
The cure is...

2774
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:08,580
What was I saying?

2775
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:11,740
I would pass.

2776
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:14,620
Yeah, he looks like Homer Simpson.

2777
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,080
I can't.

2778
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:16,780
You're right.

2779
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:21,420
Oh.

2780
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:23,920
I like his little collar.

2781
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:30,880
He's definitely a freak.

2782
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:37,780
Thinking about how he wanted to start a family that one time.

2783
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:43,740
If I could just take that aspect and forget about everything else, life would be so good.

2784
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:46,320
Just start a hybrid family with Typhlosion.

2785
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:52,640
That guy was twisted, but that just means that Typhlosion's deep down have the nature to want to sit down and have a family.

2786
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:54,080
So find a better one.

2787
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:55,800
He'll take care of you.

2788
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:57,780
He's a family man.

2789
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:58,900
He'll take care of you.

2790
01:57:58,900 --> 01:57:59,360
He's a family man.

2791
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:01,600
It's like a nature versus nurture thing.

2792
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:02,160
Exactly.

2793
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:05,880
He's different from all the other...

2794
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:09,460
He's different from the Pokemon Legends Typhlosion.

2795
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:11,420
Typhlosion allegations.

2796
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:15,020
He's here to defend himself from the allegations.

2797
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:20,660
Not all Typhlosions.

2798
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,280
You're right.

2799
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:33,300
What's his regular Pokédex entry?

2800
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,740
What does the world really know about Typhlosion?

2801
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,040
The real Typhlosion.

2802
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:41,340
If it's Rage Pete, it becomes so hot.

2803
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:44,780
He got cancelled.

2804
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:46,640
He got cancelled.

2805
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:47,860
He got cancelled.

2806
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:50,100
He got cancelled.

2807
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,100
I can't.

2808
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,640
How to catch a Typhlosion.

2809
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:58,980
It has a secret devastating move.

2810
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:02,640
It rubs its blazing fur together to cause huge explosions.

2811
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:03,580
Whoa.

2812
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:08,220
What kind of explosion?

2813
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:08,920
He lost his career.

2814
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:10,020
This sucks.

2815
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:13,900
He looks like Bakugo.

2816
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,280
Yeah.

2817
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:19,420
No, I see it.

2818
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:19,780
Smash.

2819
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:20,700
Yeah, I see it now.

2820
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:23,960
I'm a smash too.

2821
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:25,380
These guys do goofy.

2822
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:27,700
I want him to sink his little...

2823
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:29,420
I want him to do a little dance.

2824
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:30,800
That's it.

2825
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:32,840
He could cup it.

2826
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:35,940
He could have a touch.

2827
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:37,080
Just like a touch.

2828
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:40,240
Just one touch.

2829
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:41,080
That's it, little guy.

2830
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:43,700
Might I help lift it up?

2831
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:45,600
Oh, do you need a support system?

2832
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,580
You need some support right now?

2833
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:51,480
Exactly, exactly.

2834
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:52,720
Pass.

2835
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:56,360
Snuffy?

2836
01:59:57,600 --> 01:59:58,920
His name is Driller.

2837
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:02,580
Yes, he has an older brother, Snuffy.

2838
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:05,420
He has an older brother, Snuffy.

2839
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:08,780
Don't have to get the younger one.

2840
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:12,020
My arms are broken from reaching so hard this whole stream.

2841
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:14,620
Pass.

2842
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:16,580
I'm all out.

2843
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,360
Why are you looking at me like that?

2844
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:21,020
It's body can dig straight through the ground.

2845
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:22,700
That's crazy.

2846
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:25,640
Why is he looking at us like that?

2847
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:29,180
He has boots on the front, but not boots on the back.

2848
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,540
Let's see the fur.

2849
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:34,680
Looking at her.

2850
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,620
She hit the ground.

2851
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:39,960
Look at the eyes.

2852
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:44,480
It reminds me of Pepe Le Pew.

2853
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,860
I'm gonna pass.

2854
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:54,520
I feel like this one actually looks like a fursona to me.

2855
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,320
It looks like a fursona?

2856
02:00:57,180 --> 02:00:57,960
It does.

2857
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:00,360
It looks like a fake mon.

2858
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:02,180
Yeah, right?

2859
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,000
It just got too big of a head.

2860
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:06,260
And what the fuck is up with the tail?

2861
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:07,460
Is he gonna clean my floors?

2862
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:11,080
Is that a mop?

2863
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:14,040
Yeah, it feels like a mop.

2864
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:14,380
Oh.

2865
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:16,840
You know what?

2866
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:17,300
Smash.

2867
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:19,620
Yeah.

2868
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,860
He looks like Tuxedo Mask.

2869
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:23,080
Yeah, right?

2870
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:25,180
I don't think we gotta explain ourselves.

2871
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:27,260
That's obviously a smash right there.

2872
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,100
He's just so cool.

2873
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:28,980
Such a cool guy.

2874
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:30,960
Smash.

2875
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:31,420
Pass.

2876
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:33,560
He's just gonna disappear.

2877
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:34,600
He's gonna teleport out.

2878
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,080
This guy will ghost you.

2879
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:39,300
Yeah, he would just use teleport.

2880
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:40,560
And he's gone.

2881
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:43,940
I also am genuinely freaked out about their arms.

2882
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,420
And their shoulders.

2883
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:47,280
I don't know what that is.

2884
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:49,640
It's very alien-like.

2885
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,000
Yeah, it looks like an alien.

2886
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:56,860
I've never been able to catch an Abra in the original first games.

2887
02:01:56,980 --> 02:01:58,940
Because I kept fucking teleporting out.

2888
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:00,880
And it pissed me off so bad.

2889
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:04,280
I'm gonna say...

2890
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:04,980
Pass.

2891
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:08,200
I mean, there's a reason why Sabrina had all of them.

2892
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,080
That's what I've been saying!

2893
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:11,740
Pass, but I can tell...

2894
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:12,560
I can see it.

2895
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:14,840
Oh, absolutely.

2896
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:15,880
Like, no...

2897
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:21,260
Imagine just being, like, in the pile of that.

2898
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:23,560
I don't need a loophole for this spaghetti.

2899
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:24,880
That's so hot.

2900
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:27,480
I need me a weird tentacle monster.

2901
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:30,200
I'm passing, but I can see the vision.

2902
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,820
Just, not for me.

2903
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:33,960
It's absolutely filled with that thing.

2904
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:38,260
My dreams would come true.

2905
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:38,940
Pass.

2906
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:40,820
What the fuck do I do with this?

2907
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,500
What is it?

2908
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,920
It's like a ninja, I guess?

2909
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:46,820
A ninja bug?

2910
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:50,160
Oh, is it like Ninjask or whatever?

2911
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:53,540
Yeah, it's two feet tall.

2912
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:54,920
It's 55 pounds.

2913
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:57,040
He's two feet tall?!

2914
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:58,140
He looks so...

2915
02:02:58,140 --> 02:02:59,720
He looks like a short king.

2916
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,980
Dumbass does not make sense.

2917
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:02,760
I hate it.

2918
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:07,700
Having removed its heavy shell becomes very light and can fight with ninja-like movements.

2919
02:03:08,020 --> 02:03:09,700
When its body dries out it weakens.

2920
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:12,840
It wraps a membrane around itself for protection.

2921
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:14,100
Wait.

2922
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:16,320
Apparently, it's a ninja slug.

2923
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:18,920
A ninja slug?

2924
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:20,380
Where's the slug?

2925
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:21,320
It's, like, inside.

2926
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:22,680
Like, this is the snail.

2927
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:25,820
The membrane must be the ninja covering thing.

2928
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:26,140
Yeah.

2929
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:29,600
You can see, like, the snail shell right here.

2930
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:30,480
I think.

2931
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:31,480
And then...

2932
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:32,920
Yeah, that part is the shell.

2933
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:34,400
And then he's in here.

2934
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:35,020
Pass.

2935
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:35,980
Pass.

2936
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:38,240
It's confusing.

2937
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:39,980
I hate it.

2938
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:40,460
Pass.

2939
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:43,820
Oh my God, he's...

2940
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:45,240
He's what?

2941
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:45,760
Pass.

2942
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:48,260
He's so cute.

2943
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:50,200
I would, like, sleep on top of it.

2944
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,800
I won't do anything to it, but I'll sleep on top of it.

2945
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:56,620
He's just here.

2946
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:57,900
He's a comfy little guy.

2947
02:03:58,660 --> 02:03:58,680
Pass.

2948
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:02,200
Pass.

2949
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:05,600
Pass.

2950
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:07,160
I do love Marshtomp, though.

2951
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:10,020
He's just a fun guy.

2952
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:13,220
A smash of whimsy and joy?

2953
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:14,840
Yeah, I don't wanna...

2954
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:17,340
Are you gonna corrupt Marsht...

2955
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:19,600
You're gonna corrupt him?

2956
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:23,420
No, Marshtomp would, like, marry me first.

2957
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:24,620
And then...

2958
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:26,600
have children.

2959
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:29,400
But then he'll lose his whimsy.

2960
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:31,880
Innocence.

2961
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:37,060
I would meet Marshtomp in college.

2962
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:40,340
And we'd, like, be in the same book club or something.

2963
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:46,760
You're, like, coming up with this whole scenario of how you guys meet.

2964
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:53,440
And then we'd, like, talk at the library and then his little fins would, like, slightly brush against my, like, pinky.

2965
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:55,980
And then he'd be like, sorry.

2966
02:04:58,700 --> 02:05:02,120
Then he evolves into Swampert when you guys settle down.

2967
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:04,460
Yeah, and then my room smells like a swamp.

2968
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:06,760
My God!

2969
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:09,920
Pass.

2970
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:10,940
Okay.

2971
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:12,940
I think he's just...

2972
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:18,060
I feel like he'll not be there the next day.

2973
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:20,120
I'm in love with an emo girl.

2974
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,860
He's like an e-boy.

2975
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:28,680
This guy would take a photo of himself being, like, emo and be like, I was thinking of you today.

2976
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:32,380
What are those cams called?

2977
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:33,820
Those TikTok cams for e-boys?

2978
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:34,660
What are they called?

2979
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:36,800
Fan cams?

2980
02:05:36,820 --> 02:05:39,080
Yeah, it looks like he makes a fan cam of himself.

2981
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:44,020
And then, like, shows his abs like, hey girl, you ever seen this?

2982
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:47,980
Pass.

2983
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:48,520
Wow.

2984
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:51,400
I don't like his vibes.

2985
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:52,680
I don't like his vibes either.

2986
02:05:52,940 --> 02:05:54,360
I don't think he'll call the next day.

2987
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:54,820
He's a fuckboy.

2988
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:55,840
Yeah, he is.

2989
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:57,040
He is a fuckboy.

2990
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:57,740
He definitely...

2991
02:05:57,740 --> 02:05:59,360
He would probably... He would call.

2992
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:00,100
He would be desperate.

2993
02:06:00,460 --> 02:06:03,360
Yeah, he would be super desperate and cling to you and be super talkative.

2994
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:04,260
Oh, thirst traps!

2995
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:05,460
That's what I'm talking about.

2996
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:07,100
He makes those thirst traps.

2997
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:08,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2998
02:06:09,380 --> 02:06:12,160
Yeah, no, he 100% makes thirst traps.

2999
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:13,080
There's no...

3000
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:15,500
I was just thinking of you tonight, babe.

3001
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,340
And he texts that to, like, six other girls.

3002
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,860
And then everyone finds out.

3003
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:22,780
Sorry, lol.

3004
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:26,100
Sorry, that's the accident.

3005
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:29,800
Pass, pass.

3006
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:31,260
Pass.

3007
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:35,600
Oh, that's the pre-evolution of that thing that alien mind control.

3008
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:36,760
Yeah, yeah.

3009
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:38,180
Really?

3010
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:42,340
You raise it and then the mind controls you later.

3011
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:47,580
The way you evolve him is when you evolve him, you have to flip your Nintendo DS upside down.

3012
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:48,340
Wait, what?

3013
02:06:48,460 --> 02:06:49,120
Oh, because, like...

3014
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:50,680
Yeah, I remember that.

3015
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:53,960
Yeah, because, like, his hair becomes... That's, like, his hair later.

3016
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:54,840
Yeah, he, like, flips upside down.

3017
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:55,200
Yeah, yeah.

3018
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:57,080
So that's how you evolve him.

3019
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:57,740
I see it.

3020
02:06:57,820 --> 02:06:58,400
I see it.

3021
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:01,300
But you literally would have to flip your DS.

3022
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:01,780
It knew.

3023
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:02,500
It was cute.

3024
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,700
I wonder, like, how you evolve it now.

3025
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:07,580
No, because you can't...

3026
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:09,680
Chat says you can do it with your switch skill.

3027
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:10,640
Oh, okay.

3028
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:12,980
I guess because you're portable and you need to flip it.

3029
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:13,900
Oh, that's smart.

3030
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:14,820
Pass.

3031
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:15,620
Oh.

3032
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:18,420
Not that one.

3033
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:18,820
Not that one.

3034
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:19,200
The other one.

3035
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:21,160
This one's a saw blade.

3036
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:23,020
No, not this one.

3037
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:27,300
Cut your fucking innards in half or, like, shreds.

3038
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:27,940
Pass.

3039
02:07:28,660 --> 02:07:30,880
I'd like to keep my intestines, please.

3040
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:31,680
Pass.

3041
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:32,320
Oh, God.

3042
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:33,240
I don't like it.

3043
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:34,700
Not...

3044
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:36,700
He swims up.

3045
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:39,340
This guy...

3046
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:42,220
Get a load of this guy, alright?

3047
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:44,220
Pass.

3048
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:50,000
He looks like a dreepy... He looks like one of those, like, no thoughts dogs.

3049
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:51,240
He looks like...

3050
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,380
He looks like he runs into walls on accident.

3051
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:58,660
Yeah, he looks like he's chasing his tail, too, but he just doesn't stop.

3052
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:00,560
And you're like, is he okay?

3053
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:05,220
Century says it's so weak that a mere child can fight it.

3054
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:06,700
Wait, what?

3055
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:09,860
Fucking child.

3056
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:13,380
It's like...

3057
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:16,980
It's like there's, like, those, like...

3058
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:20,600
Why would that kid is beating up this defenseless little guy, dude?

3059
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:28,160
You know, like, how... Have you ever read that article where a daycare got shut down because they were running a secret underground, like, baby ring?

3060
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:29,820
Oh, yeah!

3061
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:32,360
They were doing TikToks, weren't they?

3062
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:32,800
Or something?

3063
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:34,140
I feel like they were... Yeah.

3064
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:35,100
Something crazy like that.

3065
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:36,600
A toddler fight club?

3066
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:43,880
Yeah, there was a toddler fight club, and a daycare got shut down because people found out it was, like, an underground fight club for children.

3067
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:45,680
And then I could see that.

3068
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:51,260
You put a dreepy there and a child, and you were like, who would win, guys?

3069
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:56,880
Next week, my child's gonna fight this iggly bum.

3070
02:08:58,220 --> 02:08:59,260
What the...

3071
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:01,260
Child or Pokemon?

3072
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:04,360
G-G-G-Gum versus coughing baby.

3073
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:09,840
We do not talk about the toddler fight club.

3074
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:15,460
Yeah, and then they found out because it got, like, uploaded on TikTok or some shit.

3075
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:16,240
Yeah, yeah.

3076
02:09:16,980 --> 02:09:18,020
That's so funny.

3077
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:25,200
They had, like, an account, and I think it was something like people saw in the background or something, and they got investigated, and it was, like, super crazy.

3078
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:26,760
It's so crazy.

3079
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:28,240
Surely it wasn't real fights.

3080
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:31,300
I think it was a fight club.

3081
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:32,180
It was...

3082
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:38,260
I think it was because, like, people would report that their kid would come back, like, with bruises and scars.

3083
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:39,980
Yeah, because they're like...

3084
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:42,400
And then they're like, oh, your child just fell down, you know?

3085
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:44,560
Like, they just fell down a couple of stairs type deal.

3086
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,520
I'm just surprised they got away for so long.

3087
02:09:50,640 --> 02:09:54,560
Well, to be fair, daycares are incredibly hard to, like...

3088
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:55,680
Like, get in.

3089
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:56,720
They're desperate.

3090
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:59,220
Alright, Molly Mega.

3091
02:10:00,580 --> 02:10:01,180
Molly?

3092
02:10:02,180 --> 02:10:03,120
Oh, sorry.

3093
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:05,460
How do you pronounce it?

3094
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:06,860
Mawile?

3095
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:08,300
Mawile.

3096
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:11,380
I don't know why, she's so cute.

3097
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:14,180
Like, I guess, like...

3098
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:17,420
Rattysundere Mawile.

3099
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:18,960
No, she'd be kinda kudere.

3100
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:20,760
I feel like she'd be...

3101
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:21,700
What does kudere mean?

3102
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:24,420
Yeah, what is kudere?

3103
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:26,960
Like, uh...

3104
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:29,320
Like, kinda...

3105
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:30,760
Like, kinda...

3106
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:31,920
Cool with it?

3107
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:33,420
I don't know how to...

3108
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:35,600
She's like Sabrina.

3109
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:38,480
She does sorta look like Sabrina.

3110
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:42,660
It says, Don't be taken by this Pokemon's cute face.

3111
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:43,420
It's very dangerous.

3112
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:48,120
Mawile fools the foe into letting its guard down, then chomps down with its massive jaws.

3113
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:51,380
The steel jaws are really horns that have been transformed.

3114
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:55,100
Dude, I wanna be Brock with his victory bell.

3115
02:10:58,910 --> 02:11:01,670
I feel like Brock would just be, like, even better.

3116
02:11:02,170 --> 02:11:04,250
Is that Brock, or was that...

3117
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:05,210
What was his name?

3118
02:11:05,850 --> 02:11:06,770
Oh, James!

3119
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:07,350
James!

3120
02:11:07,890 --> 02:11:10,390
Oh yeah, James is the one with the victory bell.

3121
02:11:10,570 --> 02:11:12,350
Yeah, that would have woken something in me for sure.

3122
02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:13,850
Victory bell?

3123
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:16,230
You wanna get forged by a victory bell?

3124
02:11:16,230 --> 02:11:18,730
Yeah, his victory bell would just start...

3125
02:11:18,730 --> 02:11:22,470
I'm just wondering, like, when you start you get, like, semi-digested, you know?

3126
02:11:23,390 --> 02:11:24,170
By the...

3127
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:25,810
I guess...

3128
02:11:25,810 --> 02:11:28,050
You just wanna get digested a little bit, you know?

3129
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:29,890
That's how she shows her love to me.

3130
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:32,790
It's like, digesting the clothes off my body.

3131
02:11:33,250 --> 02:11:34,350
It's like a Komodo dragon.

3132
02:11:38,450 --> 02:11:39,990
Alright, I can see the vision.

3133
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:41,070
I'll say smash.

3134
02:11:42,250 --> 02:11:42,650
Pass.

3135
02:11:42,650 --> 02:11:43,050
I'll say pass.

3136
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:45,870
Unless you wanna do a wax play.

3137
02:11:47,930 --> 02:11:49,990
I mean, he's a portable wax play.

3138
02:11:55,530 --> 02:11:56,950
I say pass.

3139
02:11:59,810 --> 02:12:00,650
I'ma keep it at that.

3140
02:12:01,670 --> 02:12:02,090
What?

3141
02:12:03,610 --> 02:12:04,610
That's a candle.

3142
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:05,470
That's a cat.

3143
02:12:06,570 --> 02:12:09,290
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with letting your Pokémon sit on you.

3144
02:12:09,290 --> 02:12:11,290
I can't.

3145
02:12:11,810 --> 02:12:12,850
I can't.

3146
02:12:13,090 --> 02:12:13,770
Pass.

3147
02:12:13,970 --> 02:12:15,750
That's just a problem in bed.

3148
02:12:19,250 --> 02:12:21,350
If, like, Jumpluff was, like...

3149
02:12:22,190 --> 02:12:25,490
If Jumpluff was a problem, this one's just a disaster.

3150
02:12:25,930 --> 02:12:26,730
Yeah, yeah.

3151
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:27,810
Pass.

3152
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:30,890
Turn your body into a chia pet.

3153
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:35,950
Moss growing on your butt or something.

3154
02:12:37,650 --> 02:12:38,030
Pass.

3155
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:39,910
Actually, that thing was a foot tall.

3156
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:40,450
I didn't even know.

3157
02:12:40,570 --> 02:12:41,730
I thought that was, like, a tinier one.

3158
02:12:41,930 --> 02:12:42,310
Cleffa?

3159
02:12:42,570 --> 02:12:45,250
Nah, this thing is...

3160
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:45,730
Pass.

3161
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:50,910
I turn him into a bong.

3162
02:12:55,970 --> 02:12:56,350
Pass.

3163
02:12:56,630 --> 02:12:57,410
What do you do?

3164
02:12:58,570 --> 02:13:00,830
What do you do?

3165
02:13:00,870 --> 02:13:01,210
How?

3166
02:13:01,210 --> 02:13:01,230
How?

3167
02:13:03,010 --> 02:13:05,310
What is the correlation anymore?

3168
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:08,090
It's lava!

3169
02:13:08,550 --> 02:13:09,770
I can't even...

3170
02:13:09,770 --> 02:13:12,050
It doesn't even have, like, a hole or anything.

3171
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:16,430
At least the rock I could, like, wedge it between and get some, like, severe burns.

3172
02:13:16,530 --> 02:13:19,470
But this is, like... If I even touch it, I'm just melting.

3173
02:13:23,370 --> 02:13:24,330
At least...

3174
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:27,430
She makes no sense.

3175
02:13:28,270 --> 02:13:29,730
It's a vibe sort of thing.

3176
02:13:29,950 --> 02:13:32,250
Like, there's no rocks for her to do it.

3177
02:13:32,470 --> 02:13:33,210
Yeah, yeah.

3178
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:34,270
This is just...

3179
02:13:34,270 --> 02:13:35,850
This is just lava.

3180
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:38,350
It's like wanting to fuck my, like, kitchen sink.

3181
02:13:43,630 --> 02:13:44,150
Pass.

3182
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:48,230
It's a poodle.

3183
02:13:49,550 --> 02:13:50,010
Pass.

3184
02:13:50,350 --> 02:13:54,930
This thing is a freak and belongs to somebody freakier.

3185
02:13:55,290 --> 02:13:55,650
Dude.

3186
02:13:56,730 --> 02:14:02,170
I know... You know how, like, golden doodles and... Sometimes they have, like, human-esque eyes.

3187
02:14:02,370 --> 02:14:04,910
They look like a human trapped inside of a dog.

3188
02:14:07,150 --> 02:14:12,790
The worst part is, is, like, even though the eyes look like that, it's because I feel like they make eye contact with you.

3189
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:13,910
They don't look anywhere else.

3190
02:14:13,910 --> 02:14:15,470
They just stare at you just like that.

3191
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:16,710
And it's just like...

3192
02:14:16,710 --> 02:14:17,210
Freak dogs.

3193
02:14:17,630 --> 02:14:20,050
Golden doodles, like, bark at them because I'm like, I know what you are.

3194
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:20,550
I know.

3195
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:22,670
Pass.

3196
02:14:22,670 --> 02:14:24,370
You're a human so trapped in that dog.

3197
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:25,230
I know it.

3198
02:14:25,450 --> 02:14:28,110
You've committed some sin to be here.

3199
02:14:29,950 --> 02:14:30,470
Pass.

3200
02:14:31,910 --> 02:14:33,850
It looks kind of like a sonic person.

3201
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:34,270
I don't know why.

3202
02:14:34,270 --> 02:14:36,470
He looks like a sonic ghost, like a sonic villain.

3203
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:38,590
Or, like...

3204
02:14:38,590 --> 02:14:39,250
Algium.

3205
02:14:40,490 --> 02:14:43,830
Or, like... Yeah, he just looks like someone that belongs in Sonic.

3206
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:44,490
Pass.

3207
02:14:44,730 --> 02:14:51,990
This thing says it uses psychic power to squeeze its opponent's brain causing unendurable headaches.

3208
02:14:52,790 --> 02:14:53,830
That's just horrific.

3209
02:14:54,050 --> 02:14:55,190
Squeezing the brain.

3210
02:14:56,050 --> 02:14:59,770
Rumors of its origin are linked to a UFO crash site in the desert 50 years ago.

3211
02:14:59,990 --> 02:15:00,090
What?

3212
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:02,750
I didn't even know that.

3213
02:15:04,410 --> 02:15:07,470
This thing can squeeze your brain and it came from a UFO.

3214
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:10,030
Why do we let this on Earth just, like, wander around?

3215
02:15:10,910 --> 02:15:14,170
Why does the government not take him away?

3216
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:18,030
Why are we letting him free from the world?

3217
02:15:18,030 --> 02:15:20,190
Let's let this thing integrate with our other species.

3218
02:15:20,190 --> 02:15:21,330
It's the natural order of Pokemon.

3219
02:15:21,850 --> 02:15:24,310
Pokemon have no rights to lock him up.

3220
02:15:25,170 --> 02:15:26,870
The Roswell Pokemon.

3221
02:15:27,290 --> 02:15:28,130
Oh my God.

3222
02:15:28,190 --> 02:15:29,110
That was Glorp.

3223
02:15:29,470 --> 02:15:29,870
Glorp.

3224
02:15:30,450 --> 02:15:31,070
Glorp.

3225
02:15:31,590 --> 02:15:32,610
Eggly Glorp.

3226
02:15:33,050 --> 02:15:33,930
Eggly Glorp.

3227
02:15:34,630 --> 02:15:35,090
Seadra.

3228
02:15:35,210 --> 02:15:38,010
Okay, I can see how people would smash Seadra.

3229
02:15:38,050 --> 02:15:38,610
Yeah, same.

3230
02:15:38,950 --> 02:15:40,410
I didn't see it, but I pass.

3231
02:15:41,110 --> 02:15:41,450
Yeah.

3232
02:15:42,490 --> 02:15:43,110
Pass.

3233
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:46,130
It says touching the back fin causes numbness.

3234
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:47,610
It hooks its tail to coral.

3235
02:15:48,810 --> 02:15:49,350
Kind of intriguing.

3236
02:15:50,050 --> 02:15:50,950
Alright, pass.

3237
02:15:52,890 --> 02:15:53,370
Orbeetle.

3238
02:15:54,950 --> 02:15:55,430
Orbeetle.

3239
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:57,590
Looks like a Bakugan.

3240
02:15:58,310 --> 02:15:59,550
Oh, it does!

3241
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:00,130
Yeah!

3242
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:02,090
Looks like a Bakugan.

3243
02:16:02,150 --> 02:16:03,030
Yeah, that's a pass.

3244
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:04,410
Holy Big Mac!

3245
02:16:04,810 --> 02:16:07,650
Dude, it says that's its brain on the Pokedex.

3246
02:16:07,810 --> 02:16:08,290
What?

3247
02:16:08,430 --> 02:16:09,430
This thing?

3248
02:16:09,430 --> 02:16:10,430
I don't like that at all!

3249
02:16:10,430 --> 02:16:12,310
I'm just gonna grip the brain?

3250
02:16:12,970 --> 02:16:13,150
Yeah.

3251
02:16:13,910 --> 02:16:14,390
Pass.

3252
02:16:18,010 --> 02:16:20,490
Like, the fin would be in the way here.

3253
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:25,390
You look so gentlemanly, though.

3254
02:16:26,150 --> 02:16:28,430
Oh my God, she's one of those...

3255
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:29,850
Pass.

3256
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:32,810
He would call me Ojo-sama.

3257
02:16:33,630 --> 02:16:34,710
Ojo-sama?

3258
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:35,090
He does!

3259
02:16:35,550 --> 02:16:37,430
Look at his chest.

3260
02:16:37,550 --> 02:16:38,930
He's got like a maid pattern.

3261
02:16:38,930 --> 02:16:40,190
He's like a butler.

3262
02:16:40,470 --> 02:16:41,030
He's an empress.

3263
02:16:41,950 --> 02:16:43,930
Yeah, he is like a butler.

3264
02:16:45,090 --> 02:16:47,310
He can carry you anywhere.

3265
02:16:48,170 --> 02:16:49,190
He'd be like, my lady.

3266
02:16:49,210 --> 02:16:50,070
Butler, quick!

3267
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:51,530
Make me a hot chocolate.

3268
02:16:52,130 --> 02:16:53,130
Yes, Ojo-sama.

3269
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:55,990
He's so nice.

3270
02:16:56,030 --> 02:16:57,570
Someone was like, I named him Sebastian.

3271
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:01,370
Twirling my hair.

3272
02:17:04,070 --> 02:17:05,290
Fin for spanking.

3273
02:17:05,290 --> 02:17:05,950
What?

3274
02:17:06,710 --> 02:17:07,030
Yeah.

3275
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:10,630
Whoa.

3276
02:17:12,830 --> 02:17:13,410
I'm passing.

3277
02:17:14,970 --> 02:17:15,610
Wow.

3278
02:17:16,610 --> 02:17:17,750
He's such a good pick, too.

3279
02:17:19,750 --> 02:17:20,790
Husbando material.

3280
02:17:23,210 --> 02:17:24,470
Treats you so well.

3281
02:17:24,690 --> 02:17:26,530
He can't even bend his arms.

3282
02:17:26,790 --> 02:17:27,530
Look at him.

3283
02:17:28,490 --> 02:17:30,450
He can't even bend his arms.

3284
02:17:30,990 --> 02:17:32,770
No, he can.

3285
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:33,430
Look at that.

3286
02:17:33,570 --> 02:17:35,030
It's just a flat surface.

3287
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:35,930
It's like a table.

3288
02:17:36,270 --> 02:17:36,530
He doesn't need to.

3289
02:17:37,850 --> 02:17:39,350
He's got fingers, see?

3290
02:17:39,470 --> 02:17:40,210
And he can do that.

3291
02:17:40,410 --> 02:17:42,290
He can do anything you would want him to do.

3292
02:17:42,910 --> 02:17:43,390
Try.

3293
02:17:43,690 --> 02:17:44,130
For you.

3294
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:46,250
He'll try his best.

3295
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:48,370
I want him to...

3296
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:49,270
Be quiet.

3297
02:17:55,670 --> 02:18:00,230
I have bad feelings towards Drowsy.

3298
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:01,630
I...

3299
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:02,830
Yeah, me too.

3300
02:18:02,930 --> 02:18:03,710
I saw the leaks.

3301
02:18:03,950 --> 02:18:05,950
I saw...

3302
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:10,050
I have negative feelings towards Drowsy.

3303
02:18:10,670 --> 02:18:11,930
I feel like...

3304
02:18:11,930 --> 02:18:13,270
Yeah...

3305
02:18:13,790 --> 02:18:14,410
Pass.

3306
02:18:15,030 --> 02:18:17,150
I don't like it.

3307
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:19,130
Explode.

3308
02:18:20,790 --> 02:18:21,830
Pass.

3309
02:18:22,190 --> 02:18:25,930
I feel like...

3310
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:27,910
I feel like...

3311
02:18:27,910 --> 02:18:29,450
I mean, he has a lot of holes.

3312
02:18:30,890 --> 02:18:31,250
Fellas...

3313
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:32,430
Fellas, would you smash?

3314
02:18:33,730 --> 02:18:34,990
He's extra loud.

3315
02:18:35,370 --> 02:18:36,270
What are you saying, though?

3316
02:18:36,470 --> 02:18:40,290
Are you really suggesting that people wanna, like, stick a dick in his, like, knee hole?

3317
02:18:40,490 --> 02:18:41,330
Yeah, like, all the...

3318
02:18:41,330 --> 02:18:42,110
No, not just the knee.

3319
02:18:42,170 --> 02:18:43,090
There's holes everywhere.

3320
02:18:43,230 --> 02:18:44,010
There's one, two...

3321
02:18:44,010 --> 02:18:45,910
He could be an ocarina.

3322
02:18:48,610 --> 02:18:49,330
An ocarina?

3323
02:18:49,330 --> 02:18:50,450
Do you think if you put your...

3324
02:18:50,910 --> 02:18:55,990
You put your dingle dongle into one hole and you start thrusting, it's gonna make, like, a sound out of the others?

3325
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:56,050
Yeah!

3326
02:18:57,050 --> 02:18:58,810
No, it's gonna be like...

3327
02:19:00,890 --> 02:19:01,970
Just play.

3328
02:19:02,470 --> 02:19:03,130
Oh, my God.

3329
02:19:03,390 --> 02:19:05,010
You can fuck his brains.

3330
02:19:05,190 --> 02:19:06,490
You can fuck his brains out.

3331
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:12,110
My thought is that I can fuck his brains out.

3332
02:19:12,230 --> 02:19:13,810
That is...

3333
02:19:13,810 --> 02:19:14,610
No!

3334
02:19:16,170 --> 02:19:16,710
No!

3335
02:19:19,510 --> 02:19:23,210
I'm gonna use him as a JBL speaker and play Fetty Wap.

3336
02:19:27,330 --> 02:19:27,930
Pass.

3337
02:19:28,110 --> 02:19:29,050
Oh, pass.

3338
02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:30,770
I can see him in the corner, though.

3339
02:19:30,910 --> 02:19:33,010
One of my most hated Pokemon.

3340
02:19:34,090 --> 02:19:35,090
Bucky's beaver.

3341
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:36,930
I can see you put him in the corner.

3342
02:19:38,430 --> 02:19:39,950
He's a watchdog.

3343
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:42,610
Bussy's beaver.

3344
02:19:43,170 --> 02:19:43,770
Pass.

3345
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:46,870
It's just a fish.

3346
02:19:47,370 --> 02:19:50,030
I will now pleasure myself with this fish.

3347
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:53,210
Yes.

3348
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:54,270
Just exactly.

3349
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:56,590
There's something I specifically think of every time I see this.

3350
02:19:56,650 --> 02:19:58,210
And yes, yes, it's always been a dream of mine.

3351
02:19:58,270 --> 02:19:59,150
I don't care if I would die.

3352
02:20:00,190 --> 02:20:02,530
Wait, isn't he, like, electric Pokemon, too?

3353
02:20:02,670 --> 02:20:03,870
No, he's an earth type.

3354
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:04,650
He's a mudfish.

3355
02:20:06,630 --> 02:20:08,830
Wait, how do you know so much about Barboach?

3356
02:20:09,250 --> 02:20:10,370
Because I love Barboach.

3357
02:20:10,450 --> 02:20:11,770
I unironically love Barboach.

3358
02:20:11,790 --> 02:20:12,670
He's one of my favorite Pokemon.

3359
02:20:12,790 --> 02:20:15,290
When I was a little kid, I probably had 200 Barboach cards.

3360
02:20:15,410 --> 02:20:18,190
And most of them were exactly the same card from the same set.

3361
02:20:19,530 --> 02:20:20,550
He's so cute.

3362
02:20:20,550 --> 02:20:21,750
He is weird.

3363
02:20:21,970 --> 02:20:24,230
He's so cute that you want him in you?

3364
02:20:24,470 --> 02:20:24,730
Yes.

3365
02:20:25,890 --> 02:20:28,370
You ever see that one eel video, Doki?

3366
02:20:29,450 --> 02:20:29,730
What?

3367
02:20:30,750 --> 02:20:31,310
What?

3368
02:20:32,110 --> 02:20:32,670
Oh.

3369
02:20:33,670 --> 02:20:34,790
What video?

3370
02:20:38,690 --> 02:20:40,330
It shouldn't be mentioned, actually.

3371
02:20:40,550 --> 02:20:42,790
So, if you haven't seen it...

3372
02:20:42,790 --> 02:20:43,850
You know...

3373
02:20:45,310 --> 02:20:46,490
I don't even know.

3374
02:20:46,510 --> 02:20:47,450
What do you mean by that?

3375
02:20:49,970 --> 02:20:51,590
My chat's like, do not engage.

3376
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:53,150
I just inulted my brain forever.

3377
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:54,070
If you know, you know.

3378
02:20:54,310 --> 02:20:56,810
I know, I know.

3379
02:20:57,730 --> 02:20:58,430
Alright, alright.

3380
02:20:59,130 --> 02:20:59,530
Asumaru.

3381
02:21:01,210 --> 02:21:01,610
Pass.

3382
02:21:02,690 --> 02:21:04,010
That's the Easter Bunny.

3383
02:21:05,210 --> 02:21:06,010
I'm like...

3384
02:21:06,010 --> 02:21:06,550
Pass.

3385
02:21:08,570 --> 02:21:11,290
He's just here to have a good time.

3386
02:21:11,490 --> 02:21:13,050
I wanna go... I wanna like, bait with it.

3387
02:21:13,110 --> 02:21:13,750
Like, make a cupcake.

3388
02:21:15,430 --> 02:21:16,090
Pass.

3389
02:21:16,410 --> 02:21:16,770
Doki.

3390
02:21:17,850 --> 02:21:18,490
That's wrong.

3391
02:21:20,030 --> 02:21:21,710
Doki's baby pictures.

3392
02:21:23,630 --> 02:21:26,830
This was before you grew your first head feathers.

3393
02:21:27,210 --> 02:21:28,430
Before I got my head feathers.

3394
02:21:30,990 --> 02:21:32,830
Can you imagine?

3395
02:21:33,050 --> 02:21:35,950
Baby Doki, but without the feathers.

3396
02:21:37,430 --> 02:21:38,510
Guys, please.

3397
02:21:38,990 --> 02:21:41,110
Doki community, please draw a naked baby.

3398
02:21:41,110 --> 02:21:41,570
Baby Doki.

3399
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:45,170
Baby Doki.

3400
02:21:45,590 --> 02:21:47,490
I can't wear clothes.

3401
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:49,410
What do you mean by baby?

3402
02:21:50,030 --> 02:21:50,590
As a bird?

3403
02:21:50,830 --> 02:21:51,910
I think as a baby bird.

3404
02:21:56,090 --> 02:21:56,650
Officer.

3405
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:58,370
I didn't mean it like that.

3406
02:21:58,550 --> 02:21:59,370
Like a chicken.

3407
02:21:59,690 --> 02:22:00,690
Like a baby chick.

3408
02:22:00,870 --> 02:22:02,570
I need some bathroom after that.

3409
02:22:02,590 --> 02:22:04,030
I'll be right back.

3410
02:22:05,490 --> 02:22:06,470
I'm crying.

3411
02:22:06,470 --> 02:22:07,130
Why?

3412
02:22:08,670 --> 02:22:10,090
I'm squirming.

3413
02:22:10,430 --> 02:22:11,990
I'm writhing like...

3414
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:14,750
Like a snail you just sprayed salt on.

3415
02:22:15,630 --> 02:22:16,370
My bee.

3416
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:17,410
My bee.

3417
02:22:19,450 --> 02:22:20,330
Blending.

3418
02:22:26,230 --> 02:22:27,110
Poipole.

3419
02:22:27,890 --> 02:22:28,630
Very nice.

3420
02:22:28,730 --> 02:22:30,690
This definitely doesn't look just like an enema.

3421
02:22:31,730 --> 02:22:32,610
Poipole.

3422
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:33,470
Poipole.

3423
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:35,830
The Poipole.

3424
02:22:36,650 --> 02:22:38,870
It looks like it would be...

3425
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:40,010
A little trickster.

3426
02:22:40,390 --> 02:22:42,030
And it would install...

3427
02:22:42,030 --> 02:22:44,570
Really fricked up viruses on your computer.

3428
02:22:45,250 --> 02:22:46,610
And it would...

3429
02:22:46,610 --> 02:22:47,570
Find joy in that.

3430
02:22:47,570 --> 02:22:49,490
He would scam me on Gaia Online.

3431
02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:51,110
Yeah!

3432
02:22:51,910 --> 02:22:52,750
That's true.

3433
02:22:53,590 --> 02:22:55,070
Wait, this thing has like no...

3434
02:22:55,070 --> 02:22:57,370
It says...

3435
02:22:57,370 --> 02:23:01,870
This Ultra Beast is well enough liked to be chosen as a first partner in its own world.

3436
02:23:01,870 --> 02:23:02,970
Oh, it's like a...

3437
02:23:02,970 --> 02:23:04,970
It's like a Squirtle in its own world.

3438
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:07,650
It's like a starter Pokemon in an alternate world.

3439
02:23:07,750 --> 02:23:08,830
That's kind of cute, actually.

3440
02:23:09,290 --> 02:23:10,470
That is cute.

3441
02:23:10,930 --> 02:23:12,150
It got a big head.

3442
02:23:13,650 --> 02:23:15,110
Looks like a...

3443
02:23:15,110 --> 02:23:17,350
Like a cyber rotisserie chicken.

3444
02:23:18,010 --> 02:23:22,590
It cackles wildly as it sprays opponents with the poison needles on its head.

3445
02:23:23,410 --> 02:23:24,250
Those are needles?

3446
02:23:24,750 --> 02:23:26,450
Yeah, I guess it's...

3447
02:23:26,450 --> 02:23:29,350
It belongs to Ash.

3448
02:23:29,350 --> 02:23:29,790
Really?

3449
02:23:30,330 --> 02:23:32,890
I didn't know Ash had an Ultra Beast.

3450
02:23:33,530 --> 02:23:35,430
I've never seen this thing, really.

3451
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:36,910
In media or a game.

3452
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:39,210
It becomes a syringe dragon.

3453
02:23:39,490 --> 02:23:40,930
Wait, now I want to see its...

3454
02:23:40,930 --> 02:23:41,930
Oh my god.

3455
02:23:42,510 --> 02:23:44,090
What is that?

3456
02:23:44,570 --> 02:23:45,870
That's definitely an enema.

3457
02:23:47,730 --> 02:23:49,950
This is just the enema Pokemon.

3458
02:23:50,570 --> 02:23:51,070
No!

3459
02:23:58,310 --> 02:23:58,910
No!

3460
02:23:58,910 --> 02:23:59,270
No!

3461
02:24:01,570 --> 02:24:03,870
It's about to give me the COVID vaccine.

3462
02:24:03,970 --> 02:24:05,010
I hate it!

3463
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:08,530
It was so cute!

3464
02:24:08,610 --> 02:24:11,690
It has so much potential to be like a Curly or something.

3465
02:24:12,570 --> 02:24:13,930
Wait, what are you guys talking about?

3466
02:24:13,970 --> 02:24:14,910
Back, by the way.

3467
02:24:15,210 --> 02:24:17,290
Dude, look up this Pokemon's evolution.

3468
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:19,010
Please, right now.

3469
02:24:19,490 --> 02:24:21,850
Yes, look up Poipole Evolution.

3470
02:24:22,390 --> 02:24:23,690
Okay, wait, give me the picture.

3471
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:24,370
It's in the Discord.

3472
02:24:24,370 --> 02:24:26,430
Naganadel, I think is its name.

3473
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:28,530
Yeah, let me post the picture for you.

3474
02:24:29,630 --> 02:24:31,270
It looks like this.

3475
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:33,930
What the fuck!

3476
02:24:34,870 --> 02:24:36,470
That's what I've been saying!

3477
02:24:36,910 --> 02:24:37,930
What the fuck!

3478
02:24:38,330 --> 02:24:39,670
Maybe you can stick something in.

3479
02:24:39,970 --> 02:24:40,850
Oh my god!

3480
02:24:43,230 --> 02:24:44,570
It's a literal douche!

3481
02:24:45,070 --> 02:24:45,990
I can't!

3482
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:47,630
That's what I'm saying.

3483
02:24:48,110 --> 02:24:50,810
Why is it a douche?

3484
02:24:51,170 --> 02:24:52,570
Why is it a douche?

3485
02:24:52,570 --> 02:24:53,350
Oh my god!

3486
02:24:53,830 --> 02:24:56,190
Why is it shaped like that?

3487
02:24:56,610 --> 02:24:57,550
Why is it?

3488
02:24:58,290 --> 02:24:59,630
Oh my god!

3489
02:24:59,650 --> 02:25:00,330
I can't.

3490
02:25:00,730 --> 02:25:01,330
I'm ill.

3491
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:02,610
I'm passing.

3492
02:25:03,250 --> 02:25:04,490
I'm passing.

3493
02:25:06,410 --> 02:25:07,910
That's just an anchor.

3494
02:25:08,190 --> 02:25:08,530
I'm passing.

3495
02:25:08,990 --> 02:25:11,630
I would grind against that thing, though.

3496
02:25:12,390 --> 02:25:12,750
No!

3497
02:25:13,370 --> 02:25:13,990
Why?

3498
02:25:14,590 --> 02:25:16,770
I mean, I can see like...

3499
02:25:16,770 --> 02:25:17,830
Yeah, I can see you guys.

3500
02:25:18,050 --> 02:25:19,870
That shit got quite the badussy.

3501
02:25:20,430 --> 02:25:22,230
The turkey baster.

3502
02:25:22,450 --> 02:25:23,890
I think like...

3503
02:25:23,890 --> 02:25:25,230
The ghost is this one.

3504
02:25:25,410 --> 02:25:27,590
The seaweed is the ghost part.

3505
02:25:27,750 --> 02:25:29,870
He just like grabs on to like...

3506
02:25:30,830 --> 02:25:31,650
Random stuff?

3507
02:25:31,830 --> 02:25:32,850
Yeah, apparently.

3508
02:25:33,030 --> 02:25:36,130
I remember it's the seaweed that's the actual part of him.

3509
02:25:36,310 --> 02:25:37,530
I wanna know the lore now.

3510
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:39,350
I love ghost Pokemon lore.

3511
02:25:39,850 --> 02:25:40,750
Oh my god, what is this?

3512
02:25:40,810 --> 02:25:44,890
Swinging its massive anchor, it can KO Wailord in a single blow.

3513
02:25:45,150 --> 02:25:45,950
It can KO Wailord?

3514
02:25:49,270 --> 02:25:54,330
It's like a brain damage.

3515
02:25:55,710 --> 02:25:58,430
It just crushes the skull in.

3516
02:25:59,590 --> 02:26:01,450
Dude, that's crazy.

3517
02:26:01,650 --> 02:26:05,390
It says it wraps its prey in green seaweed and sucks away their vitality.

3518
02:26:05,610 --> 02:26:08,670
It only likes to go after big prey like Wailord.

3519
02:26:09,150 --> 02:26:10,050
Oh, goodbye, Bao.

3520
02:26:10,050 --> 02:26:11,730
It specifically is a Wailord prey.

3521
02:26:11,870 --> 02:26:12,410
What the heck?

3522
02:26:12,690 --> 02:26:14,830
Oh my god, it just says, fuck you, Wailord.

3523
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:15,730
I'm passing.

3524
02:26:15,930 --> 02:26:17,130
It one shots me.

3525
02:26:17,330 --> 02:26:18,550
Get this guy away from me.

3526
02:26:20,410 --> 02:26:31,150
I want him to hold me in his little cape arms and cuddle me.

3527
02:26:31,370 --> 02:26:32,570
He looks like a gentleman.

3528
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:34,830
He looks like a perfect gentleman.

3529
02:26:35,990 --> 02:26:42,390
He's gonna clean your hair like a bird.

3530
02:26:42,730 --> 02:26:45,310
Oh my god, like preen you and everything?

3531
02:26:45,310 --> 02:26:46,110
He's gonna...

3532
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:48,870
You guys are like, hold on.

3533
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:51,050
It's so crazy.

3534
02:26:51,230 --> 02:26:51,750
I know.

3535
02:26:52,290 --> 02:26:55,350
And he has bird abs too, right here.

3536
02:26:55,530 --> 02:26:57,010
Oh my god, a bird abs.

3537
02:26:57,570 --> 02:26:58,370
That's crazy.

3538
02:26:58,830 --> 02:27:02,570
They look like abs, but then when you touch them, they're probably so soft.

3539
02:27:02,570 --> 02:27:03,310
They're soft.

3540
02:27:03,550 --> 02:27:04,430
Oh my god.

3541
02:27:04,810 --> 02:27:06,210
He's the perfect man.

3542
02:27:06,910 --> 02:27:07,850
How tall is he?

3543
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:09,030
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

3544
02:27:09,110 --> 02:27:09,890
Is this a Dew-Eye?

3545
02:27:10,210 --> 02:27:10,970
Yeah, this is a Dew-Eye.

3546
02:27:12,490 --> 02:27:13,710
He's five feet.

3547
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:15,050
He is perfect.

3548
02:27:16,490 --> 02:27:17,550
Alright, smash.

3549
02:27:17,650 --> 02:27:18,470
Dash me, man.

3550
02:27:18,630 --> 02:27:19,230
Pass.

3551
02:27:21,830 --> 02:27:23,030
Don't even...

3552
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:23,770
Wait.

3553
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:31,470
He can hold you.

3554
02:27:33,690 --> 02:27:36,770
This is literally like a human, practically.

3555
02:27:36,870 --> 02:27:38,670
He kinda looks like Barra Art, you know what I mean?

3556
02:27:38,670 --> 02:27:40,270
Yeah, yeah, I see that.

3557
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:42,910
Barra Yaoiya's art.

3558
02:27:43,870 --> 02:27:44,230
Yeah.

3559
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:45,470
Yeah.

3560
02:27:46,270 --> 02:27:50,250
I feel like...

3561
02:27:50,250 --> 02:27:52,770
There's like a specific artist...

3562
02:27:52,770 --> 02:27:54,610
that's very famous...

3563
02:27:54,610 --> 02:27:55,590
for Barra Art.

3564
02:27:56,210 --> 02:27:57,150
What's his name?

3565
02:27:58,190 --> 02:28:00,190
He looks like he'd be illustrated by him.

3566
02:28:02,050 --> 02:28:05,090
He looks like he's like an after school summoner's character.

3567
02:28:05,770 --> 02:28:06,630
I'd still smash them.

3568
02:28:06,630 --> 02:28:07,770
I feel like...

3569
02:28:09,190 --> 02:28:10,070
I'd pass.

3570
02:28:10,210 --> 02:28:11,930
I feel like he'd just use me as a beard.

3571
02:28:14,230 --> 02:28:14,990
That's crazy.

3572
02:28:18,430 --> 02:28:18,870
Wow.

3573
02:28:43,030 --> 02:28:43,630
Ooh.

3574
02:28:44,470 --> 02:28:45,290
Still pass.

3575
02:28:47,490 --> 02:28:49,630
My entire chat is chanting...

3576
02:28:49,630 --> 02:28:50,430
One pump chump.

3577
02:28:50,730 --> 02:28:53,190
One pump chump!

3578
02:28:53,430 --> 02:28:55,210
Because it says single strike.

3579
02:28:55,570 --> 02:28:57,070
That's wild.

3580
02:28:57,350 --> 02:28:58,090
He's just...

3581
02:28:58,090 --> 02:29:00,110
Bro, he's just not ready for it.

3582
02:29:00,270 --> 02:29:01,070
It's too much.

3583
02:29:01,070 --> 02:29:03,070
It's just too much for him.

3584
02:29:03,170 --> 02:29:04,290
Strike of his fist.

3585
02:29:04,990 --> 02:29:05,590
Instakill.

3586
02:29:05,590 --> 02:29:06,350
Up your ass.

3587
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:12,180
Oh, we're at 95 now, guys.

3588
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:13,720
You guys wanna call it when we hit 100?

3589
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:15,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3590
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:15,680
Alright.

3591
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:18,180
Our last 5, guys.

3592
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:19,360
Last 5.

3593
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:22,180
Pass.

3594
02:29:22,740 --> 02:29:24,220
I know like this...

3595
02:29:24,220 --> 02:29:26,340
The nails are supposed to be poisonous too.

3596
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:28,900
So it's like, he can't grip you...

3597
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:31,120
because he's gonna fucking poison you.

3598
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:32,500
No matter what.

3599
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:34,780
At night, you hear the...

3600
02:29:34,780 --> 02:29:35,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3601
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:39,260
You have like a fucking antidote.

3602
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:44,440
So you can't even like...

3603
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:46,740
So like, he licks you and then you get poison.

3604
02:29:49,320 --> 02:29:51,880
It just says the poison is in its knuckle claws...

3605
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:53,280
that secrete toxin...

3606
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:54,980
and it's pumped from the sack.

3607
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,620
So I don't think...

3608
02:29:56,620 --> 02:29:58,220
I think only the claws have the sack.

3609
02:29:58,420 --> 02:30:00,320
So like, you have to bandage it up.

3610
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:02,140
Go, yo, yo, yo, yo.

3611
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:03,680
I'm gonna pass.

3612
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:05,680
It's like a little stress ball.

3613
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:08,120
Ew, it's probably like...

3614
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:10,260
I would be scared I'd like pop it.

3615
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:12,480
Do you guys remember Brock's...

3616
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:14,000
crow gunk?

3617
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:16,140
And he would constantly like...

3618
02:30:16,140 --> 02:30:18,420
iron fist his ass whenever like...

3619
02:30:18,420 --> 02:30:19,700
Officer Jenny appeared?

3620
02:30:19,860 --> 02:30:20,440
Oh yeah.

3621
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:22,400
Kick him in the balls.

3622
02:30:24,820 --> 02:30:26,660
Yeah, that was so funny.

3623
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:27,520
Pass.

3624
02:30:28,020 --> 02:30:29,700
Poison stored in the sack, yeah.

3625
02:30:29,820 --> 02:30:31,500
Oh hey, that's your favorite Pokemon.

3626
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:32,080
Duffy.

3627
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:34,860
But like, bigger.

3628
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:36,800
This doesn't look as fun to go up the ass anymore.

3629
02:30:37,900 --> 02:30:39,620
There's no appeal whatsoever now.

3630
02:30:40,060 --> 02:30:41,020
Skip, pass.

3631
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:42,720
But he has the Hulk fist.

3632
02:30:43,140 --> 02:30:45,520
Wait, but he has the Hulk fist though.

3633
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:46,320
Nah.

3634
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:46,860
Your favorite.

3635
02:30:47,260 --> 02:30:49,180
Yeah, what's the difference between these?

3636
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:51,240
He looks so much scarier.

3637
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:52,840
He's angry just like Hulk.

3638
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:53,960
Darmanitan.

3639
02:30:55,020 --> 02:30:55,560
Darmanitan.

3640
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:59,540
So you're willing to put a...

3641
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:00,660
Hulk fist on top of a...

3642
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:01,200
Rhyhorn.

3643
02:31:01,540 --> 02:31:03,340
He looks like a freak.

3644
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:06,520
He's heavy breathing.

3645
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:07,620
He's like...

3646
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:09,300
That's a freak.

3647
02:31:13,080 --> 02:31:14,900
It says it's internal fire...

3648
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:17,140
burns at 2500 degrees...

3649
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:18,050
Fahrenheit, which is actually...

3650
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:18,720
more.

3651
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:20,460
That's hotter than the...

3652
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:21,500
flame in coal piles.

3653
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:23,700
Making it enough power...

3654
02:31:23,700 --> 02:31:25,660
that it can destroy a dump truck...

3655
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:26,640
with one punch.

3656
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:31,120
It just deflates your ass.

3657
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:34,680
It just starts deflating.

3658
02:31:35,780 --> 02:31:37,240
One punch.

3659
02:31:38,740 --> 02:31:39,660
Sudowoodo.

3660
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:44,020
I love Brock's Sudowoodo.

3661
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:45,500
He wouldn't want...

3662
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:49,120
He would take active damage.

3663
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:50,580
If like...

3664
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:52,660
Yeah, I feel like he's...

3665
02:31:52,660 --> 02:31:53,700
He always gets hurt, right?

3666
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:54,480
He's like...

3667
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:56,060
weak as hell in the end.

3668
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:58,320
Yeah, he's like a...

3669
02:31:58,320 --> 02:31:59,200
rock type.

3670
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:00,880
Yeah, he's a rock type, but he's like weak.

3671
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:02,380
He's a weak rock type.

3672
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:03,980
He's got bad stats.

3673
02:32:04,580 --> 02:32:06,060
I feel like if like...

3674
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:08,100
you do like one thing to him, he'll like...

3675
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:09,880
in critical care, he'd be like 1 HP.

3676
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:12,620
You'd have to take him to...

3677
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:13,560
Sudowoodo.

3678
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:14,320
He'd be scared of you.

3679
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:15,560
He like runs from people.

3680
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:16,680
Yeah.

3681
02:32:17,780 --> 02:32:19,800
Yeah, I feel like if I get robbed, I'd die.

3682
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:20,640
He'll just run away.

3683
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:22,260
This has got to be the worst Pokemon.

3684
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:25,220
Yeah, it has the ability...

3685
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:27,320
He's afraid of a watering can.

3686
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:28,980
He's afraid of a watering can.

3687
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:30,660
Is this anybody's favorite?

3688
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:32,840
I've never heard anybody say Sudowoodo is their favorite.

3689
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:35,900
And they say somebody's, you know, there's a Pokemon for everybody, right?

3690
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:37,900
Yeah, but he's so silly.

3691
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:39,140
I don't...

3692
02:32:39,140 --> 02:32:39,380
Really?

3693
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,760
He runs when it rains.

3694
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:41,740
He just kind of looks uncomfortable.

3695
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:43,060
I don't like his spots, too.

3696
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:44,480
He looks sick.

3697
02:32:46,380 --> 02:32:47,720
He's so cute.

3698
02:32:50,060 --> 02:32:51,540
I don't believe that person.

3699
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:54,280
He has a weakness to water.

3700
02:32:54,680 --> 02:32:56,860
There's no...

3701
02:32:58,820 --> 02:33:00,660
He's so weak to water.

3702
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:01,560
What do we do?

3703
02:33:01,940 --> 02:33:03,720
Anyone into piss play?

3704
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:10,560
We can't do anything with him.

3705
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:11,600
He's...

3706
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:12,680
He'll die.

3707
02:33:12,880 --> 02:33:14,260
He'll actually die.

3708
02:33:15,020 --> 02:33:17,280
No, do not the Sudowoodo.

3709
02:33:17,360 --> 02:33:18,280
Okay, pass.

3710
02:33:18,380 --> 02:33:19,740
I mean, like, what do I...

3711
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:21,640
It's just Ditto with a metal head.

3712
02:33:23,300 --> 02:33:25,560
It's like a Ditto, but like...

3713
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:26,320
Mercury.

3714
02:33:27,460 --> 02:33:27,980
Mercury.

3715
02:33:30,220 --> 02:33:33,080
He's not even an inch in height, also.

3716
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:37,280
But he weighs 17 pounds, despite being not even an inch tall.

3717
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,960
Oh, he's a tungsten cube.

3718
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:46,100
It says it melts particles of iron and other metals found in the subsoil, so it can absorb them into its body of molten steel.

3719
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:48,420
No, please don't call him the car!

3720
02:33:52,250 --> 02:33:53,010
Imagine that, dude.

3721
02:33:53,130 --> 02:33:56,910
Putting your thingy in there, and then, like, it's like jello.

3722
02:33:57,330 --> 02:33:57,970
Oh, it's like weighing you down.

3723
02:33:57,970 --> 02:33:58,930
It starts like...

3724
02:33:58,930 --> 02:34:00,550
Oh, you flex it.

3725
02:34:00,650 --> 02:34:01,610
You can make it stronger.

3726
02:34:02,590 --> 02:34:04,190
It's like a weight, you know?

3727
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:06,730
It's like one...

3728
02:34:07,430 --> 02:34:08,110
You know?

3729
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:09,550
Because, like, I can move that.

3730
02:34:09,550 --> 02:34:11,630
But it's like one, two...

3731
02:34:14,430 --> 02:34:15,590
It's draining!

3732
02:34:16,310 --> 02:34:18,230
What is bro training for?

3733
02:34:22,230 --> 02:34:24,070
What would you train?

3734
02:34:29,290 --> 02:34:30,730
I can't...

3735
02:34:30,730 --> 02:34:33,030
That is some bonky shit.

3736
02:34:33,130 --> 02:34:33,950
I can't.

3737
02:34:35,270 --> 02:34:38,610
What are the remaining Pokémon we're getting?

3738
02:34:40,450 --> 02:34:41,990
My bro on the...

3739
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:45,210
My bro's on the right nostril, and I'm on the left nostril.

3740
02:34:47,290 --> 02:34:49,370
And there's a third one, too, on the back.

3741
02:34:50,690 --> 02:34:52,950
We can have the bro on top, right here.

3742
02:34:53,110 --> 02:34:54,070
On top of it, right there.

3743
02:34:54,090 --> 02:34:56,670
I'm just gonna be fucking, like, umbrella-ing on that thing.

3744
02:34:57,070 --> 02:34:57,730
Spinning around.

3745
02:34:59,930 --> 02:35:03,350
So, you know how, like, there's, like, the Eiffel Tower?

3746
02:35:08,590 --> 02:35:14,250
There's one on top here, you lie on top here, and then one here, and the other here.

3747
02:35:18,730 --> 02:35:20,910
We are never joining the Pokémon League.

3748
02:35:21,430 --> 02:35:25,850
You know what we said about how, like, halfway through this, you would be...

3749
02:35:25,850 --> 02:35:29,990
I feel like now you're truly thinking with gusto.

3750
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:32,890
We're trying to think how it works.

3751
02:35:33,130 --> 02:35:33,990
How would it work?

3752
02:35:33,990 --> 02:35:35,010
Eiffel Tower and Hippopotas.

3753
02:35:36,190 --> 02:35:38,230
I'm so proud!

3754
02:35:40,270 --> 02:35:41,510
Still pass, though.

3755
02:35:41,890 --> 02:35:42,870
Still pass.

3756
02:35:43,390 --> 02:35:44,390
Still pass.

3757
02:35:45,010 --> 02:35:47,710
I try to think, I try to envision it.

3758
02:35:47,830 --> 02:35:48,610
Still pass.

3759
02:35:49,510 --> 02:35:51,230
Oh my god!

3760
02:35:51,570 --> 02:35:54,210
We are not ending on Vanilluxe.

3761
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:56,770
We are not ending on this guy.

3762
02:35:56,770 --> 02:35:57,690
Wow!

3763
02:35:59,130 --> 02:36:04,770
If you flip it over, if you flip it over, and then, like, stick it on the floor...

3764
02:36:05,950 --> 02:36:07,670
Dude, I gotta look up the pose again.

3765
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:09,770
This one I'm so curious about as well.

3766
02:36:09,950 --> 02:36:11,150
Let me consult the books.

3767
02:36:11,850 --> 02:36:12,590
Hold on.

3768
02:36:13,150 --> 02:36:15,450
Someone said the left one looks freaky.

3769
02:36:16,070 --> 02:36:17,250
Oh my god, wait!

3770
02:36:17,250 --> 02:36:19,970
You guys, I'm gonna post something.

3771
02:36:20,210 --> 02:36:20,890
It's gonna be...

3772
02:36:20,890 --> 02:36:23,790
I'm gonna spoiler it, though, because there's some little dirty...

3773
02:36:23,790 --> 02:36:25,090
Just, like, warning.

3774
02:36:27,030 --> 02:36:29,190
Oh my god, dude!

3775
02:36:32,450 --> 02:36:34,030
Oh my god!

3776
02:36:34,030 --> 02:36:37,390
Where did you find such a little piece of art?

3777
02:36:39,450 --> 02:36:42,450
I mean, it does look like two boobs right there.

3778
02:36:42,830 --> 02:36:46,210
So, like, guys, would you smash if, like...

3779
02:36:46,210 --> 02:36:49,270
The two...

3780
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:52,650
So, it's like, you know, it looks like a boob right there.

3781
02:36:52,830 --> 02:36:53,930
Would you smash?

3782
02:36:54,410 --> 02:36:57,030
I'm gonna show you the Tommy's ice cream coins.

3783
02:36:58,690 --> 02:37:01,070
I'm gonna show you the top one.

3784
02:37:06,150 --> 02:37:08,310
The last of one, master.

3785
02:37:09,230 --> 02:37:12,110
The left one truly was the freaky one.

3786
02:37:12,570 --> 02:37:14,870
Oh, that's not with cream at the top.

3787
02:37:15,190 --> 02:37:15,390
No.

3788
02:37:19,590 --> 02:37:23,010
Sir, this is a... this is a Dairy Queen.

3789
02:37:24,870 --> 02:37:27,610
Get out of the ice cream cake, sir.

3790
02:37:29,530 --> 02:37:32,310
Get out of the ice cream cake section.

3791
02:37:32,470 --> 02:37:33,590
Okay, I'm gonna do another one.

3792
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:35,550
We are not ending up in the Lux.

3793
02:37:36,310 --> 02:37:36,770
Here we go.

3794
02:37:39,670 --> 02:37:40,910
A trad wife.

3795
02:37:41,950 --> 02:37:44,170
Yeah, she looks like a traditional wife for you.

3796
02:37:44,330 --> 02:37:44,630
Mega.

3797
02:37:45,030 --> 02:37:46,050
She, like, is...

3798
02:37:46,050 --> 02:37:47,470
She looks like she'll bake for you.

3799
02:37:47,590 --> 02:37:47,770
She's like a maid.

3800
02:37:47,770 --> 02:37:48,530
She's the new...

3801
02:37:48,530 --> 02:37:52,850
Yeah, she's the new, like, uh, chancy at the... what are they called?

3802
02:37:53,050 --> 02:37:58,410
Yeah, she looks like she'll take care of you and she'll let you, like, um, let you put your head on her laps.

3803
02:37:59,030 --> 02:38:00,870
She's like the Chobits Pokémon.

3804
02:38:01,370 --> 02:38:01,750
Yeah.

3805
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:04,390
This Pokémon has a kind heart.

3806
02:38:04,570 --> 02:38:09,130
By touching with its feelers, Ardino can gauge other creatures' feelings and physical conditions.

3807
02:38:09,610 --> 02:38:11,250
She will always know what's on her mind.

3808
02:38:11,910 --> 02:38:14,170
Oh my gosh, she'll always be there for you.

3809
02:38:14,210 --> 02:38:15,030
She's a mommy.

3810
02:38:15,890 --> 02:38:16,410
Marriage.

3811
02:38:16,850 --> 02:38:18,350
She'll be like, she's marriage material.

3812
02:38:18,490 --> 02:38:19,190
I'd smash.

3813
02:38:19,350 --> 02:38:19,650
Yes.

3814
02:38:19,790 --> 02:38:20,250
I'd smash.

3815
02:38:20,270 --> 02:38:22,070
Who said nurse play?

3816
02:38:22,470 --> 02:38:23,410
I'm gonna cry.

3817
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:26,130
Smash and marriage.

3818
02:38:26,250 --> 02:38:27,970
Smash and marriage right there.

3819
02:38:28,650 --> 02:38:29,770
She'll take care of me.

3820
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:31,750
I'll show her a place to sleep.

3821
02:38:32,110 --> 02:38:33,450
Oh my gosh.

3822
02:38:33,730 --> 02:38:36,730
Wait, how about we end it on Blastoise Gigantamax?

3823
02:38:37,390 --> 02:38:38,850
That's a canon every hole.

3824
02:38:40,470 --> 02:38:43,210
He looks bad at Big Man Blastoise.

3825
02:38:43,210 --> 02:38:45,130
Big Man Blastoise.

3826
02:38:47,270 --> 02:38:50,970
Isn't Gigantamax literally as tall as a building?

3827
02:38:52,050 --> 02:38:52,270
Yeah.

3828
02:38:53,150 --> 02:38:57,570
I feel like if you just sit on one of the canons, you'd get like, water gunned.

3829
02:38:58,250 --> 02:38:58,270
Yeah.

3830
02:38:58,870 --> 02:38:59,790
Hydro pump.

3831
02:39:00,510 --> 02:39:04,190
Just hydro pump it.

3832
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:05,930
Hell yeah.

3833
02:39:06,970 --> 02:39:10,010
I'd spit on one of his freaking claws.

3834
02:39:12,770 --> 02:39:13,130
Wow.

3835
02:39:13,150 --> 02:39:14,150
Like a freaking...

3836
02:39:14,150 --> 02:39:15,250
What are those things called?

3837
02:39:15,370 --> 02:39:16,210
A fidget spinner, dude.

3838
02:39:16,350 --> 02:39:17,330
I'd let him fidget spinner me.

3839
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:19,270
You'd just fidget spin you.

3840
02:39:19,430 --> 02:39:21,170
Like the water fidget spin.

3841
02:39:23,230 --> 02:39:23,590
Wow.

3842
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:25,970
I don't know what it is, but I just really like Blastoise.

3843
02:39:26,010 --> 02:39:27,770
I think he exudes...

3844
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:28,290
Look at this guy.

3845
02:39:28,310 --> 02:39:29,370
He's freaking aura farming.

3846
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:30,150
Look at him.

3847
02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:31,270
It's so true.

3848
02:39:31,570 --> 02:39:32,430
Oh, that's true.

3849
02:39:33,490 --> 02:39:34,890
The way he looks at you.

3850
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:36,090
I love it.

3851
02:39:36,150 --> 02:39:37,270
Yeah, he's such a badass.

3852
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:38,510
Sorry, Charizard.

3853
02:39:40,190 --> 02:39:41,550
Sorry, Charizard.

3854
02:39:42,390 --> 02:39:43,630
I'm with a badder boy now.

3855
02:39:45,770 --> 02:39:46,930
I get it.

3856
02:39:47,150 --> 02:39:47,910
No, I get it.

3857
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:49,110
I see...

3858
02:39:49,110 --> 02:39:51,250
I see her vision.

3859
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:53,770
I see it.

3860
02:39:54,330 --> 02:39:54,830
I see it.

3861
02:39:54,830 --> 02:39:57,090
I'm gonna look up Blastoise hentai and see what happens.

3862
02:39:58,510 --> 02:40:00,490
Oh my god.

3863
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:02,530
What's happening?

3864
02:40:02,990 --> 02:40:03,490
What happened?

3865
02:40:03,490 --> 02:40:05,150
What happened?

3866
02:40:05,310 --> 02:40:06,810
You're just gonna stop it there?

3867
02:40:07,150 --> 02:40:07,430
No!

3868
02:40:08,610 --> 02:40:09,950
What's happening?

3869
02:40:10,670 --> 02:40:13,890
This was everything I...

3870
02:40:13,890 --> 02:40:15,230
What do you mean this was everything?

3871
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:16,670
This was the third cannon.

3872
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:19,330
This was the third fucking cannon.

3873
02:40:19,710 --> 02:40:20,130
All right.

3874
02:40:20,490 --> 02:40:21,410
Share it in Discord.

3875
02:40:22,430 --> 02:40:23,710
I'm too scared.

3876
02:40:24,270 --> 02:40:27,950
I'm too scared to look it up.

3877
02:40:28,470 --> 02:40:28,730
Okay.

3878
02:40:30,130 --> 02:40:31,810
Oh my god.

3879
02:40:31,810 --> 02:40:32,330
I don't want it.

3880
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:35,490
This one's my favorite.

3881
02:40:36,470 --> 02:40:37,430
Which one?

3882
02:40:37,510 --> 02:40:38,730
Wait, what do you mean which one?

3883
02:40:39,050 --> 02:40:40,610
Is there more than one?

3884
02:40:41,010 --> 02:40:41,570
There's a lot.

3885
02:40:43,090 --> 02:40:43,850
There's that one.

3886
02:40:44,030 --> 02:40:46,070
What happened to his shell in all of these situations?

3887
02:40:46,350 --> 02:40:47,550
What the fuck?

3888
02:40:49,650 --> 02:40:51,190
Where did his shell go?

3889
02:40:51,430 --> 02:40:51,970
Why is he naked?

3890
02:40:52,450 --> 02:40:53,110
Why is he naked?

3891
02:40:54,090 --> 02:40:56,970
Dude, that's literally like the sonic arc.

3892
02:40:57,150 --> 02:40:58,550
Why is this just abhorrentance?

3893
02:40:58,550 --> 02:41:00,410
Why is it just...

3894
02:41:00,410 --> 02:41:02,070
Oh my god, okay.

3895
02:41:02,170 --> 02:41:04,190
The third cannon was pretty funny.

3896
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:06,370
The third cannon is pretty good.

3897
02:41:06,670 --> 02:41:09,290
The third cannon is pretty good.

3898
02:41:11,090 --> 02:41:12,450
These are crazy.

3899
02:41:12,770 --> 02:41:14,110
These are just...

3900
02:41:14,110 --> 02:41:15,410
Oh my god.

3901
02:41:15,490 --> 02:41:17,770
I get the first one.

3902
02:41:18,510 --> 02:41:19,590
He's just...

3903
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:21,230
Is this a donkey version?

3904
02:41:21,930 --> 02:41:23,670
Why does he just take...

3905
02:41:23,670 --> 02:41:25,730
He takes off his shell while he showers?

3906
02:41:26,590 --> 02:41:28,730
Wait, I could probably show this to chat.

3907
02:41:28,730 --> 02:41:29,670
Oh my god, it's the same...

3908
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:31,730
Oh my god.

3909
02:41:31,970 --> 02:41:33,190
Oh my god.

3910
02:41:33,330 --> 02:41:36,070
He looks more like a dodogama without his shell.

3911
02:41:36,470 --> 02:41:37,410
From Monster Hunter.

3912
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:39,570
He looks so cute.

3913
02:41:40,590 --> 02:41:41,770
Can I even...

3914
02:41:41,770 --> 02:41:43,990
I feel like the shell is part of the hotness for me.

3915
02:41:44,350 --> 02:41:44,850
I need it.

3916
02:41:45,390 --> 02:41:45,930
The shell?

3917
02:41:46,110 --> 02:41:47,630
Because that's where all the cannons are.

3918
02:41:48,210 --> 02:41:49,150
He's just cannonless.

3919
02:41:49,170 --> 02:41:50,210
He's actually naked.

3920
02:41:50,210 --> 02:41:50,430
He's naked.

3921
02:41:53,890 --> 02:41:55,330
This is awesome.

3922
02:41:56,850 --> 02:41:58,510
Guys, I can't show it on chat.

3923
02:41:58,650 --> 02:41:59,470
I'm sorry, guys.

3924
02:41:59,590 --> 02:42:00,990
It's a naked Blastoise.

3925
02:42:01,110 --> 02:42:01,610
I can't.

3926
02:42:03,370 --> 02:42:04,790
It's a naked...

3927
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:07,050
He doesn't even have a shell, guys.

3928
02:42:07,530 --> 02:42:09,530
Guys, he doesn't even have a shell on.

3929
02:42:09,610 --> 02:42:10,370
Guys, I can't.

3930
02:42:11,310 --> 02:42:13,850
He took it off just for you tonight.

3931
02:42:15,630 --> 02:42:17,250
Keep the shell on.

3932
02:42:20,210 --> 02:42:21,970
I have tears welling up in my eyes.

3933
02:42:21,990 --> 02:42:24,650
He doesn't love me if he takes off his shell.

3934
02:42:26,490 --> 02:42:28,270
He's an old boy, you know?

3935
02:42:28,450 --> 02:42:30,670
I feel like he's built to be Barra, though.

3936
02:42:30,770 --> 02:42:31,510
Look at him.

3937
02:42:31,670 --> 02:42:34,390
His face alone screams Barra.

3938
02:42:36,410 --> 02:42:37,470
That's not fair.

3939
02:42:37,790 --> 02:42:39,290
He's just a turtle.

3940
02:42:39,630 --> 02:42:41,010
He has to have a big shell.

3941
02:42:42,510 --> 02:42:43,650
He's just a turtle.

3942
02:42:43,650 --> 02:42:47,130
Let me remind you that this is just what he is.

3943
02:42:47,370 --> 02:42:49,130
This is screaming Barra, really?

3944
02:42:49,130 --> 02:42:50,990
Look at his regular, pure little face.

3945
02:42:52,090 --> 02:42:55,310
Yeah, but Bowser is filled with Barra art of him.

3946
02:42:55,490 --> 02:42:57,170
I feel like Bowser is like...

3947
02:42:58,010 --> 02:42:59,050
He's like...

3948
02:42:59,050 --> 02:43:01,030
He wants a wife, you know?

3949
02:43:01,090 --> 02:43:03,950
Bowser is seeking love, first of all.

3950
02:43:04,030 --> 02:43:05,070
So he's like...

3951
02:43:05,070 --> 02:43:05,750
What do they call him?

3952
02:43:06,170 --> 02:43:07,190
A bachelor?

3953
02:43:07,810 --> 02:43:10,070
Which already kind of makes him appealing.

3954
02:43:10,550 --> 02:43:11,550
Yeah, he's a Delph.

3955
02:43:12,170 --> 02:43:14,350
He's basically a Delph right there.

3956
02:43:15,550 --> 02:43:16,070
What?

3957
02:43:17,490 --> 02:43:18,010
What?

3958
02:43:18,750 --> 02:43:19,870
He has like...

3959
02:43:19,870 --> 02:43:20,330
10 kids.

3960
02:43:20,450 --> 02:43:21,910
Oh my god!

3961
02:43:22,550 --> 02:43:25,170
I am definitely not showing that.

3962
02:43:28,270 --> 02:43:29,930
Bow showed us a picture.

3963
02:43:30,150 --> 02:43:31,610
I'll describe it, guys.

3964
02:43:31,690 --> 02:43:33,050
So you can have it mentally in your head.

3965
02:43:33,210 --> 02:43:34,270
Because I had to look at it.

3966
02:43:34,730 --> 02:43:37,990
Bow sent us a picture of a...

3967
02:43:37,990 --> 02:43:40,470
Of a half-naked Blastoise.

3968
02:43:40,610 --> 02:43:41,690
Without a shell on.

3969
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:43,030
And he's rubbing his nipples.

3970
02:43:43,830 --> 02:43:46,410
Where is he rubbing his nipples?

3971
02:43:46,990 --> 02:43:48,810
I guess it kind of looks like...

3972
02:43:48,810 --> 02:43:50,510
He's ripping his shirt again.

3973
02:43:50,750 --> 02:43:52,730
He's ripping his shirt open.

3974
02:43:52,970 --> 02:43:53,650
And was like...

3975
02:43:53,650 --> 02:43:55,610
You want to rub these nipples?

3976
02:43:57,210 --> 02:43:58,470
And then...

3977
02:43:58,470 --> 02:43:59,510
And then...

3978
02:43:59,510 --> 02:44:01,650
She sent us another picture.

3979
02:44:02,150 --> 02:44:03,150
Of the same Blastoise.

3980
02:44:05,930 --> 02:44:07,290
And you can...

3981
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:07,430
He's wearing...

3982
02:44:07,430 --> 02:44:09,890
Someone said he was rubbing his nipples.

3983
02:44:09,890 --> 02:44:11,810
I thought... He kind of looks like he's doing that again.

3984
02:44:12,350 --> 02:44:13,390
And he's like...

3985
02:44:13,390 --> 02:44:15,490
Yeah, and then he's also half-naked.

3986
02:44:15,830 --> 02:44:17,250
And then he's in tighty-whities.

3987
02:44:17,510 --> 02:44:19,730
And you can clearly see...

3988
02:44:19,730 --> 02:44:21,370
His third cannon.

3989
02:44:21,830 --> 02:44:23,370
His third cannon.

3990
02:44:25,070 --> 02:44:26,270
Ready to...

3991
02:44:26,270 --> 02:44:27,670
To fire.

3992
02:44:28,210 --> 02:44:29,310
This is nothing but a waste lot.

3993
02:44:29,790 --> 02:44:30,610
I know!

3994
02:44:31,130 --> 02:44:33,070
Put in a waste lot.

3995
02:44:34,310 --> 02:44:36,990
I had a feeling someone would do this.

3996
02:44:38,430 --> 02:44:39,190
Okay.

3997
02:44:42,890 --> 02:44:45,890
I just found the art, okay?

3998
02:44:52,130 --> 02:44:53,490
Anyway, guys.

3999
02:44:53,610 --> 02:44:55,190
That was fun.

4000
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:58,090
That was a great experience.

4001
02:44:58,570 --> 02:44:59,410
I had a...

4002
02:44:59,410 --> 02:45:00,190
I need to go take a shower.

4003
02:45:01,970 --> 02:45:04,210
Cleanse the filth off of us.

4004
02:45:04,210 --> 02:45:05,950
Cleanse the filth.

4005
02:45:06,190 --> 02:45:07,750
I gotta...

4006
02:45:07,750 --> 02:45:10,690
Maybe I should go to confessional after.

4007
02:45:11,870 --> 02:45:12,170
Yeah.

4008
02:45:13,870 --> 02:45:15,210
I'll see you all on Sunday.

4009
02:45:15,930 --> 02:45:17,230
I need to repent.

4010
02:45:17,650 --> 02:45:20,950
I need to repent for my sins.

4011
02:45:23,950 --> 02:45:26,110
I should really use...

4012
02:45:26,110 --> 02:45:27,230
Some holy water today.

4013
02:45:28,850 --> 02:45:30,010
Anyway, guys.

4014
02:45:30,170 --> 02:45:31,730
Well, thank you...

4015
02:45:31,730 --> 02:45:33,610
Bow and Snuffy...

4016
02:45:33,610 --> 02:45:35,550
For joining me today...

4017
02:45:35,550 --> 02:45:37,190
On this wonderful adventure.

4018
02:45:37,790 --> 02:45:39,590
I saw a lot...

4019
02:45:39,590 --> 02:45:42,150
Of the visions you guys painted for me.

4020
02:45:42,290 --> 02:45:43,690
The imagery...

4021
02:45:43,690 --> 02:45:45,010
That was sent to me.

4022
02:45:45,690 --> 02:45:47,370
Either mentally...

4023
02:45:47,370 --> 02:45:49,430
Or actual pictures...

4024
02:45:49,430 --> 02:45:50,550
I looked at.

4025
02:45:52,290 --> 02:45:53,850
The different...

4026
02:45:53,850 --> 02:45:54,490
Possibilities.

4027
02:45:59,110 --> 02:46:00,510
I'm just saying...

4028
02:46:00,510 --> 02:46:02,870
A bunch of rocks and some coal...

4029
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:04,050
Have never gotten before.

4030
02:46:06,570 --> 02:46:08,110
It makes no sense.

4031
02:46:08,110 --> 02:46:08,710
Don't you guys...

4032
02:46:08,710 --> 02:46:10,970
Want to warm up your insides...

4033
02:46:10,970 --> 02:46:12,470
Like Snuffy does?

4034
02:46:12,570 --> 02:46:14,170
It's like sitting by the fire...

4035
02:46:14,170 --> 02:46:15,990
Except you're in the fire pit.

4036
02:46:18,270 --> 02:46:19,790
Third degree burns.

4037
02:46:20,470 --> 02:46:20,730
Wow.

4038
02:46:21,250 --> 02:46:22,910
I wonder what it's like to get...

4039
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:24,470
Third degree burns inside.

4040
02:46:24,470 --> 02:46:25,590
Inside your body.

4041
02:46:26,210 --> 02:46:26,990
Wow.

4042
02:46:29,270 --> 02:46:31,950
It was very educational.

4043
02:46:32,510 --> 02:46:33,650
Thank you, girls.

4044
02:46:33,830 --> 02:46:36,030
I enjoyed the experience.

4045
02:46:37,050 --> 02:46:37,490
Thank you for joining.

4046
02:46:37,490 --> 02:46:39,410
Can't wait to start our Pokemon journey.

4047
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:44,630
Spoiler, we've been banned from every region.

4048
02:46:45,310 --> 02:46:49,090
We're not allowed near any Pokemon Center.

4049
02:46:49,270 --> 02:46:52,250
Within 10 meters of a Pokemon Center.

4050
02:46:58,900 --> 02:46:59,920
We are...

4051
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:01,100
We are the problem...

4052
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:02,480
That Team Plasma tried...

4053
02:47:02,480 --> 02:47:04,200
To warn you about.

4054
02:47:04,860 --> 02:47:06,840
We have our own level of...

4055
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:08,580
Wanted by the...

4056
02:47:08,970 --> 02:47:10,920
Pokemon individual of the game.

4057
02:47:11,100 --> 02:47:12,400
We have our own evil org.

4058
02:47:12,660 --> 02:47:15,340
We have our own evil org.

4059
02:47:16,850 --> 02:47:18,760
Anyway, are you...

4060
02:47:18,760 --> 02:47:20,220
Are you going to keep streaming, Bell?

4061
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:22,000
Nah, I'm going to raid.

4062
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:23,560
You're going to call here?

4063
02:47:23,700 --> 02:47:24,040
Me too.

4064
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:26,280
I'm going to go talk to my chat.

4065
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:27,840
Real quick.

4066
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:29,500
Thank you, girls, for joining.

4067
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:31,340
I had a great time with you guys.

4068
02:47:31,820 --> 02:47:33,200
Thank you.

4069
02:47:33,240 --> 02:47:34,160
Very educational.

4070
02:47:35,140 --> 02:47:37,060
I'll have this Discord group chat.

4071
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:42,000
I can look back into this group chat...

4072
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,000
With fond memories.

4073
02:47:47,220 --> 02:47:48,360
Don't do that.

4074
02:47:49,980 --> 02:47:51,880
I'll see you guys later.

4075
02:47:51,880 --> 02:47:53,260
Bye-bye.

4076
02:47:53,260 --> 02:47:53,860
Bye-bye.

4077
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:56,840
Bye, guys.

4078
02:47:57,400 --> 02:47:58,080
Take care.

4079
02:47:59,620 --> 02:48:01,480
Oh my god.

4080
02:48:01,780 --> 02:48:03,720
That was...

4081
02:48:03,720 --> 02:48:06,140
What a wild ride.

4082
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:11,880
I was not expecting...

4083
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:14,180
How this stream was going to turn out.

4084
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:15,680
I went in like...

4085
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:17,780
I didn't know what degree of...

4086
02:48:17,780 --> 02:48:19,400
Degeneracy we were going to get into.

4087
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:20,820
Because I knew...

4088
02:48:21,400 --> 02:48:23,080
Inviting Bao and Snuffy...

4089
02:48:23,080 --> 02:48:24,360
Was going to open...

4090
02:48:24,360 --> 02:48:25,460
A whole new layer.

4091
02:48:27,080 --> 02:48:28,500
On this channel.

4092
02:48:29,880 --> 02:48:31,500
I was ready for it.

4093
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:32,560
I was ready for it.

4094
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:33,560
I was like...

4095
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:36,440
No restrictions.

4096
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:38,600
No barriers.

4097
02:48:39,260 --> 02:48:40,260
Let's go all in.

4098
02:48:40,980 --> 02:48:42,240
Let's go.

4099
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:44,360
Let's just...

4100
02:48:44,360 --> 02:48:47,080
It was rather tame.

4101
02:48:47,080 --> 02:48:49,580
Snuffy literally said...

4102
02:48:49,580 --> 02:48:50,780
She was going to stick...

4103
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:52,860
Electrodes up her ass.

4104
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:56,780
She was going to stick...

4105
02:48:56,780 --> 02:48:59,020
Voltorb up her ass.

4106
02:48:59,420 --> 02:49:00,920
And then I suggested...

4107
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:02,640
Give them all EXP share.

4108
02:49:02,940 --> 02:49:03,780
So then...

4109
02:49:03,780 --> 02:49:06,360
When you level one of them up...

4110
02:49:06,360 --> 02:49:08,820
You can evolve them.

4111
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:11,580
You think that's tame?

4112
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,220
That was freaking freaky.

4113
02:49:20,780 --> 02:49:22,080
That's vanilla.

4114
02:49:22,480 --> 02:49:24,280
Yeah, that's pretty tame.

4115
02:49:26,440 --> 02:49:28,600
You don't understand, Doki.

4116
02:49:29,140 --> 02:49:31,560
It could have been much worse.

4117
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:33,580
For me, that opened...

4118
02:49:33,580 --> 02:49:35,080
A whole other level for me.

4119
02:49:35,180 --> 02:49:37,820
I don't think I've gone that beyond...

4120
02:49:37,820 --> 02:49:39,800
Before they held back.

4121
02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:46,780
Anyway...

4122
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:47,060
I'm going to...

4123
02:49:51,100 --> 02:49:51,620
Anyway...

4124
02:49:51,620 --> 02:49:53,620
I hope you guys...

4125
02:49:53,620 --> 02:49:55,260
Had a...

4126
02:49:55,260 --> 02:49:56,560
Great time today.

4127
02:49:56,800 --> 02:49:57,960
I had a great time with the girls.

4128
02:49:58,320 --> 02:49:59,160
It was definitely...

4129
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:00,820
I've never done a Smasher Pass before.

4130
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:02,200
This was a charity...

4131
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:03,240
Reward.

4132
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:06,040
This was a charity goal.

4133
02:50:06,640 --> 02:50:08,700
For last year's charity stream.

4134
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:10,700
Where I said if we reach the amount...

4135
02:50:10,700 --> 02:50:11,720
We'll do a Pokemon Smasher Pass.

4136
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:13,640
So I hope you guys enjoyed the stream.

4137
02:50:14,540 --> 02:50:16,140
We went through...

4138
02:50:16,140 --> 02:50:17,880
Layers that we haven't...

4139
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:18,520
Went through before.

4140
02:50:19,400 --> 02:50:20,420
Especially for me.

4141
02:50:23,260 --> 02:50:25,160
Before I go...

4142
02:50:25,160 --> 02:50:26,840
I do want to show...

4143
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:28,600
One thing before I go.

4144
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:31,100
For those who don't know...

4145
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:33,980
These plushies are going to be...

4146
02:50:33,980 --> 02:50:35,700
Have one day left...

4147
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:36,300
To pre-order.

4148
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:38,620
So after 24 hours...

4149
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:40,320
These will be gone forever.

4150
02:50:40,320 --> 02:50:41,660
So make sure...

4151
02:50:41,660 --> 02:50:44,040
To grab your plushies before it's gone.

4152
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:47,020
We have 24 hours left.

4153
02:50:47,360 --> 02:50:47,720
So yes.

4154
02:50:47,860 --> 02:50:49,060
Find my merch.

4155
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:50,920
It's a great way to support me.

4156
02:50:51,300 --> 02:50:53,320
And also you get your very own Doki merch.

4157
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,860
That's the last thing I'm going to show today.

4158
02:50:57,280 --> 02:50:57,780
Hey guys.

4159
02:50:58,340 --> 02:50:59,260
As always everybody.

4160
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:00,620
Stay hydrated.

4161
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:01,800
Posture check.

4162
02:51:01,980 --> 02:51:04,020
To get that blood flowing.

4163
02:51:04,480 --> 02:51:06,560
Head to bed.

4164
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:08,160
Because you deserve it.

4165
02:51:08,520 --> 02:51:10,160
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4166
02:51:10,540 --> 02:51:11,400
Bye guys.

4167
02:51:11,700 --> 02:51:12,260
Bye.
