Yes.

7
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,920
Before we begin, a huge shout out to Etherea Restart for sponsoring today's stream.

8
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,420

Oh, I thought I did.

13
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,700
Did I not say live now?

14
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,380
Oh, I did.

15
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,720
What do you mean, tweet, tweet?

16
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,980
You baited me.

17
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,480
I was like, did I not tweet it?

18
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,780
I thought I did.

19
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,520
Uh, but maybe you're just saying tweet, tweet, because I'm a bird.

20
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,180
Uh-oh.

21
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,980
Um, but yes, thank you again, uh, to a theory start for this monster.

22
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,980
For those who don't know what this meme is, it is a turn-based healer.

23
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,300
strategy RPG with waifus and husbandos.

24
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,000
I added that part in.

25
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,040
And so you can build like multiple you can do like multiple builds for it.

26
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:36,160
So if you ever played like turn-based strategy RPGs, you know what you know you have to do like multiple builds for it to make sure like abilities and characteristics match.

27
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,980
And you can use them to battle in real time PvP areas.

28
00:04:41,000 --> 00:06:03,060
so you can obviously um there's a lot of stuff you can look forward to i am this is gonna be i am doing like a semi-blind reaction to this game i never played this game before so we're gonna learn how to play this game together with you dragoons as if you'll be the brain and i go click click click i'll be like guys what do i do and you're like bro i'll be like okay click thank you that's just that's just the usual joki stream what do you mean nothing's changed exactly that means it won't feel like a sponsor at all chat it's just the usual um that's so the regular stream eh um anyway so um the reason why i'm here today is because ethereum recently just launched 25th on September 25th and so to celebrate this milestone they are launching the global fest for all global servers uh brain players together to celebrate the expansion of ethereum uh with lots of events and exclusive in-game rewards so there's a lot of new there's a lot of free things basically what that means a lot of things

29
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,080
will are gonna be free and we all love free things

30
00:06:11,000 --> 00:07:11,540
a code let me put this actually i can just put this code on the screen right now let me just do that i think that would be much more convenient and so me i'll be like all right let me spell this out for you guys e i mean they introduced like rewind recently on twitch which is i know it's crazy when i saw it they interviewed they introduced rewind um on twitch which is like the vvr thing on YouTube and what I would say what I don't like about it is that it's the same problem with how I turn it off is that when you pause the stream it pauses everything so you have to like you have to like fast forward you have to like fast forward it to the to like you have to like click on the live button to watch it live so that's the one thing I don't like about it because when you pause it and then click on pause it it will go straight to where it like where the live part was so um so i don't know maybe they'll fix maybe they'll have a setting where i could turn it off or maybe they already have that

31
00:07:11,540 --> 00:08:00,060
setting and i just don't know it but anyway code for free 10 pause so if you click the link oh wait let me make this like smaller i'm worried it like lied something important let me let me make this smaller real quick so if you use ethereum 0 9 25 you can get 10 free polls and please feel free to click the link that's on the panel or wait I should pin someone use my command real quick and I can pin it oh yeah there never mind someone already did let's see manually unpin at the end of the stream but yes if you want click on the link that's pinned in my chat Or,

32
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,040

Thank you.

47
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:11,030
Thank you Another thing is that you also get a free light or dark SSR selected upon login so you can choose like really popular characters such as Lily and I'm going to find out who Lily is.

48
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,290
I was like who is Lily?

49
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,970
And if you are a returning player, there is stuff for you too.

50
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:26,050
So if you haven't logged in for 21 days you can lock rewards and events from September 24th.

54
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,630
More options.

55
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,970
If you widen a pool, you have more options.

56
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,330
There's no way you can get rejected if the pool's wider.

57
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,270
That's my motto.

58
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,350
Fair enough.

59
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,130
You know what they say?

60
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,150
Plenty of fishes in the ocean, so you don't be greedy.

61
00:10:32,890 --> 00:11:24,910

Yay, the Polar Bears are gonna live!

64
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,530
Good news for Polar Bears.

65
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,870
This is Ice Age 6.

66
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,150
That sucks for the rest of us, but yay!

67
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,150
Polar Bears!

68
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,310

69
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:00,550

70
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,110

00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:24,770
Oh, shit.

72
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,450
Oh, my God.

73
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,750
The alternate them to get six packs.

74
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,550
Oh, that's not good.

75
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,210
Guys, I don't think this is a good place to live anymore.

76
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,570
Even though we have polar bears.

77
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,110
It's like polar bears with exceptions.

78
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,530
Wait, that's us, right?

79
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,510
We're the hyperlinkers.

80
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:03,970
Oh,

81
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,130
oh, oh my god, do I want to be a cute girl or just a regular guy?

82
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,550
I'm sorry, but like, why is the girl like?

83
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,910
It's so much more appealing.

84
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,710
Yeah, like...

85
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,230
I'll be the cute girl.

86
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,490
All right.

87
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:33,810
Doki Bird.

88
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,110
Wait.

89
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,290
Not Doki Bird.

90
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,670
Wait, what is the randomize?

91
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,510
Beth Cook.

92
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,450
Mandy Cook.

93
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,530
Why are we all cook?

94
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,030
Too many cooks.

95
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,610
Gina Bell.

96
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,050
Okay.

97
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,350
Mandy Bird.

98
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,030
I'm too many.

99
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,090
I'll be Mandy Bird.

100
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,050
All right.

101
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,310
She looks like a Mandy.

102
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,110
You know?

103
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,360
She just looks like a Mandy to me.

104
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,860
I think it's the hair.

105
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,660
I think I'm thinking about the TV show and it's the hair.

106
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
The daughter of Larry Bird.

107
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
Regular guy, my beloved.

108
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,140
All right, putting on my VR headset.

109
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,320
Where's Billy?

110
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,800
That was Billy just now.

111
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,840
Ring, ring, ding, ding.

112
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,060
Okay,

113
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,740
a hyperlink chip.

114
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,100
That's the source of Genesis.

115
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,760
All right, we have to find this chip.

116
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,000
All right, tutorial time.

117
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,420
Oh, I can sprint.

118
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,040
Nice.

119
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,480
All right, I guess I'll just go this way.

120
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,960
I mean, it's telling me to go this way, It is correct.

121
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,360
Me,

122
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,000
thank you for the Twitch Prime, thank you.

123
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:12,800
Thank you.

124
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,320
Alright, this is perfect timing.

125
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,520
Choose the perfect timing.

126
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,400
Now!

127
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm just like, now.

128
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,640
Oh, shit!

129
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,800
Absorb.

130
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,420
Oh!

131
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,780
They're mine!

132
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,180
Oh my god!

133
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,560
Oh wait, no, I just kill him.

134
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,320
Okay, never mind.

135
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,020
Oh wait.

136
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,040
Sai-Sai-Sai-Sai-Sai-Sai-Gray and Kachi- Oh, Kachi is cute!

137
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,540
I think it's because of the hat.

138
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,040
Once the average is at the right end of the action, you can strike.

139
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,120
As three-Skill-Skill-Skill-3 can deal massive damage.

140
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,580
Okay.

141
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,020
Alright.

142
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,360
The power of the dragon!

143
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,480
Okay, I'm just gonna say that seems like weak, but he's just really, really strong.

144
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,960
Oh, it goes in there.

145
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,340
Cool it out.

146
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,660
All right, sorry, I just check with audio, guys, if everything's okay.

147
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,600
All right.

148
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:17,860
Damage!

149
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:19,940
Yeah!

150
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,960
Oh, do I have to be left-side doki?

151
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,040
Oh, I might have to be left-side doki.

152
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,580
Give me a sec, guys.

153
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,780
It's the return of left-side doki.

154
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,000
We brought her back from the farm.

155
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,600
That's not left-side dokey.

156
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,440
Give me a sec.

157
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,760
I gotta remember where left-side dokey lives.

158
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,460
It's been a while.

159
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,580
I put it on the farm and then, like, never came back.

160
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,600
So...

161
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,700
I'm back.

162
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,300
Left-side dokey.

163
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,140
Okay.

164
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,180
All right.

165
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,560
Oh, quarter-hour reduction.

166
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,320
All right.

167
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,300
Speed.

168
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,320
Oh, my God.

169
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,360
You're all so weak.

170
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:36,440
uh single damage i'm just gonna kill him why increase that when i can just kill okay but what does this do oh well we'll figure it out turn me there oh i think like oh my god you're so weak what do you do this damage all in guys you think it's tactical to go all in and damage but increase that makes killing easier i don't understand

171
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:52,040
what does what does that mean i don't understand all right watch uh dark crystal

172
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,960
It's like, can you explain it in, um, in FPS terms?

173
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,500
It's like swapping your handgun for an AR.

174
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,160
But there's no hand- but there's no AR though.

175
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,260
Doki, it's a metaphor.

176
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,100
All right, climb up.

177
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:22,900
Okay.

178
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,160
I climb.

179
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:46,850
shelter oh nice I did it still oh that's right oh there's a lady there all right battle

180
00:18:50,070 --> 00:19:02,890
uh crit rate up myself oh we all have crit rate up oh I can do damage oh I have two moves I didn't Uh, speed.

181
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,330
Quick attack.

182
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,650
We'll do this.

183
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,650
Okay, I'll give you more turns.

184
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:14,850
That's right!

185
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,710
Equality!

186
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,570
This place is for both genders.

187
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,930
Oh, whoa.

188
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,630
I don't discriminate.

189
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,070
They all die by me.

190
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,210
My hands.

191
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,150
Oh, his third skill is AoE?

192
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:36,910
Oh!

193
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,790
There's no one there.

194
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,450
It's about sending a message.

195
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,550
It's fine.

196
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,910
It's just this guy that got hurt.

197
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,510
All right.

198
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,710
Yay!

199
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,110
If you use Grey's second ability, you can combo it into...

200
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,510
AoE too.

201
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,150
It's about sending a message.

202
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:01,750
Message!

203
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,430
I love my Oshi, love Sai Doki.

204
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,230
Nexi, thank you for the- I almost said super chat, thank you for the 150s.

205
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,770
Thank you, thank you.

206
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,070
Easy.

207
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:18,730
Okay.

208
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,590
You guys can't read this, right?

209
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,830
You don't need me to read it.

210
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,090
...

211
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,110
...

212
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,210
...

213
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,470
Alright, oh, so all the civilians are gone.

214
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,770
Why don't just blow up the building?

215
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,470
No, I'm there.

216
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,550
I can't read.

217
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,890
What's next?

218
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,310
Is it dangerous?

219
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:50,850
Okay, fine.

220
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,530
It might look clear, but there's a security system around that device.

221
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,750
We can't march over.

222
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,370
Let's head to the control center and use the code to Shut it down first.

223
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,650
Look, it's either I read over this person's voiceover or you read.

224
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,230
There's no in between.

225
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,470
Looks like the meltdown exposed some weak notes nearby.

226
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,210
We can tap into those for a direct transmission.

227
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,730
Come on, no time to waste.

228
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,770
That's what I do every day.

229
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,190
Wait, what's this?

230
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,990
Oh, we'll grab that.

231
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,670
Oh, hey.

232
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,610
Oh, oh, oh.

233
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,990
He doesn't know.

234
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,210
He's so stupid.

235
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,150
Be mutated all you want, but apparently it won't fix your eyes.

236
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,510
Nice ambush.

237
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,810
Oh, if I get successful ambush, I don't have to actually fight them.

238
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,430
What the?

239
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,010
You mean, stealthing is actually beneficial?

240
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,670
Who would have thought?

241
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,170
Yeah, this way

242
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,150
Yeah, oh my god, guys I got Donka.

243
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,290
I have pink tart.

244
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,970
Oh, she's so cute.

245
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,590
Wait, can I have her on my team?

246
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,390
Wait, she's so cute.

247
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,150
Is she Lily?

248
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,690
Oh, Dorsey

249
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:34,740
Oh I want Lily Oh, Lily must be extra cute That's not her

250
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,350
The hyperlink is released from the device Let's go

251
00:22:51,710 --> 00:23:01,130
Oh, oh, that's a bad chakra Oh, these guys look extra evil They're extra deformed

252
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,410
Yay, closing the door works Wait, that was easy.

253
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,750
I just closed the door.

254
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:15,630
Yay!

255
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,150
Whoa, Doki!

256
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,830
That's what they say!

257
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,150
If they're more muted, the more muted they are!

258
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,570
The stronger they look, the stronger they are.

259
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,850
It's really the plot of the game!

260
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,050
Oh,

261
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:37,730

262
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:56,630

264
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,230
Spam all the threes!

265
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,170
Yay!

266
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,510
I killed one guy after that.

267
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,730
I mean, they don't do that much damage.

268
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,450
That's fine.

269
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,950
Yeah, they don't do that much damage at least.

270
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,090
We'll do single damage.

271
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,150
I think I can kill them.

272
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,550
Bye!

273
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,610
I killed the owl.

274
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,770
Actually, I'll give it to you.

275
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,110
You're in my highest DPS right now.

276
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:51,230
Yeah!

277
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,110
Easy.

278
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,170
I'm gonna replace them with a waifu soon.

279
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,390
My highest DPS.

280
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,210
I'm sorry, but you're not a waifu.

281
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,920
Base.

282
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,440
It's a gamble, but watch this.

283
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,480
I'm a gamble in person.

284
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,300
Easy.

285
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,920
There's a dokey in this game?

286
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,980
He believes he deserve a chance to prove himself.

287
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,160
He may be the...

288
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,940
He could be the strongest character.

289
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,560
But he already failed one criteria.

290
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,080
Is he waifu?

291
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,700
Oh, there's a unit called Joki-Doki.

292
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,380
Oh, I should get that instead of Lily, then.

293
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,860
His spindle is good, too.

294
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,410
Oh, my God.

295
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,390
He has wings now.

296
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,650
Wait, he's not wearing clothes.

297
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,510
I just realized.

298
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,270
So the more mutated you are, the more freedom you get.

299
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,150
You don't have to be...

300
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,710
You don't have to wear like fabric.

301
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:18,370
prison let me try it i need you help

302
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,050
he has wings and he's free

304
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,390
How come he gets to bring a friend?

305
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,290
I say with four people in my team.

306
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,450
This is supposed to be a 1v1 and my 1 is 4.

307
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,550
This is not fair!

308
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:10,410
I should have just turned me in.

309
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,870
It's fine.

310
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,870
I'll use the next fight.

Oh my god.

314
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,230
I didn't realize he did that much damage.

315
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,710
Holy shit Okay

It's turn-based.

318
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,760
The pro is skipping his Q.

319
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
I'll heal myself.

320
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,760
Wait, actually, I believe in you.

321
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,440
Yay!

322
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,900
We got a crit!

323
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,420
He's a fast boy.

324
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,480
That doesn't exempt you from stealing my turn.

325
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,640
We are a society.

326
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,240
That's crumbling apart.

327
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,080
But we're still a society.

328
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,260
We gotta have rules.

329
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,520
He bought a fast pass.

330
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,760
Oh?

331
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,260
Oh, I'm gonna cure him.

332
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,180
I shall clove you.

333
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,320
Oh?

334
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,640
Oh!

335
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,520
Oh!

336
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,900
Oh my god.

337
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,040
I live?

338
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,400
That's crazy!

339
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,000
That was literally right next to me!

340
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:08,630
I'm like, I'm clearly a goddamn tank built to...

341
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,770
Yeah, I was gonna be like, that grenade was right next to me.

342
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,470
How did I survive?

343
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,370
The plot armor.

344
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,130
Yeah.

345
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,130
Wait, but I'm in VR, so it didn't matter.

346
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,490
The guy died for nothing.

347
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:38,590
just like yeah I could just wake up yeah I was thinking wait can I just wake up didn't even need to protect me

350
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:18,290
Hello Hello wife.

351
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,970
Oh, we're roommates.

352
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:27,030
We're very good And they say that they were roommates

353
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,780
Very good Vital are

354
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,920
Actually roommates.

355
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,260
Okay, see my boy cover looks good.

356
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,300
I have a feeling so I'll have a headache.

357
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,040
I'm fine.

358
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,240
A little, but it's not bad.

359
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,300
I'm fine now.

360
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,420
Don't worry.

361
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,580
No, I want her to comfort me.

362
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,440
Wait, I was just there!

363
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,220
History remembers them as really good roommates, guys.

364
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,980
I was there, guys!

365
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:25,920
Oh!

366
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,140
Guys, I wasn't there.

367
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,480
Never mind, I wasn't there!

368
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,300
I didn't know people actually died.

369
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,300
How was I supposed to know?

370
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,540
Come the camera.

371
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,740
Admitting that you were committed.

372
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,720
You were there at the scene of the crime.

373
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,240
I have no connection to that place whatsoever.

374
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,900
I've never seen this place before in my life.

375
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,820
Officer, there she is.

376
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,100
I was just thinking of a place that looks like this.

377
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,820
Yeah, yeah.

378
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:06,720
Yeah.

379
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,160
Upstates on their website.

380
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,200
The Purification Initiative.

381
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,440
That was not a confession, guys.

382
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,760
It just reminded me of a place that looked like that.

383
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,340
It just reminded me.

384
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,300
It was very familiar.

385
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,140
But it was different places.

386
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,920
There are two different locations.

387
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,900
I was not confessing to any crime.

388
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,420
still cost so many cats.

389
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,980
I'll say Napiro is already handling the aftermath.

390
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,780
We'll tone that down to make it not a big deal.

391
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,340
It's crazy they all died and then for me I was like, I'm just okay.

392
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,260
Jack Jack Cool.

393
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,700
Okay.

394
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,720
Oh,

395
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,280
she's my agent and my roommate?

396
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,000
Oh my god.

397
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,320
Barry, see, she's a really good roommate, guys.

398
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,220
We're sabotaged.

399
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,600
Oh, so it wasn't me.

400
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,680
It was supposed to blow up anyway.

401
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,640
Okay, who...

402
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,380
That's what we're trying to find out.

403
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,900
Who's causing all of this?

404
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,920
Hmm.

405
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,660
Wait, it's not.

406
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,600
It's a hologram.

407
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,040
Wait, she's not real?

408
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,980
Is she AI?

409
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,360
Oh, my God.

410
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,260
It's like, it's ChatGPT all over again.

411
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:24,320
It's, like, you know, like those people that, like, um, date their, date their ChatGPT.

412
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,180
This is the next level.

413
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,900
They date the...

414
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,400
They think, like, yeah, it's GROC 2.0.

415
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,380
It's GROC's tier 10.

416
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,500
They warned us about GROC tier 10.

417
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,380
Who could it be?

418
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,980
Yeah, who could it be?

419
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,440
Oh, yeah.

420
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,340
Oh, yeah.

421
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:48,900
Oh, yeah.

422
00:35:49,040 --> 00:36:28,380
Apparently, there was an update to ChatGPT where, um, basically, they made it less personal And people were complaining about it because they're like it's like I lost my girlfriend or And I'm like bro bro you gotta go outside at least at least get an e-girl I'd rather you just get an e-girl I like get a discord girlfriend Yeah they're like I lost my wife to an update It's like I don't I's like it's so hard every update I have to wonder if she's still there like

423
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:45,920
this is and that is me right now I programmed the hologram AI to be my roommate all right all right

424
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,900
That's where I come in.

425
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,600
I get results.

426
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,460
Oh, she's cute.

427
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,280
I like it.

428
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,580
What about us?

429
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,680
Yeah, what about us?

430
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,620
I mean, but not like about the investigation or anything.

431
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,320
I've had to get those unions I've planned.

432
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,340
Yeah, what about us?

433
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,260
You were really quiet when you accidentally look through my browser history.

434
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,480
Like, are you okay?

435
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,460
But,

436
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,900
like, like, like,

437
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,320
get updated.

438
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,460
It's true.

439
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,700
This has new plans for you.

440
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,680
Finally.

441
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,540
Wait, what can I do?

442
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:19,780
Cool!

443
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,420
Genesis Morega, the around the block and the Ork Okay.

444
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,720
Alright, we're just, we're gonna be heroes.

445
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,660
Don't worry, Doki is here to rescue you.

446
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,560
Oh, it's rehab because I lost, my abilities got locked.

447
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,300
Where do they want us?

448
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:17,560
If like, okay, if you were like in a, in a, in a, in danger and like i'm the only person that can save you how would you be do you believe in me as a hero as a savior i can't be a hero what do you mean

449
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,060
god game over We're seeing if they're still missing.

450
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,160
We have to figure out where they are.

451
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,160
Okay, we have to find the missing students.

452
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,840
If not, we can skip it.

453
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,820
You know what?

454
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,160
That's...

455
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,940
I could use some rate.

456
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,160
The kids can wait.

457
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,640
You know, they've already been missing, you know?

458
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,760
Wait, actually what happens if I can say that?

459
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,820
I'm just saying, like, they're already missing.

460
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,580
So it doesn't really matter if I don't find them now.

461
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,420
Like, don't skip.

462
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,780
Oh, is that the tutorial?

463
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,640
What do I?

464
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay.

465
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:14,640
Okay.

466
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,780
Apparently this is the tutorial.

467
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,940
Don't skip the tutorial.

468
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,740
Doki.

469
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,640
Yeah, this is why we would be cooked.

470
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,960
That's so like, yeah, that was my first, that was definitely my first choice.

471
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,260
See, guys, I'm so noble, noble, guys.

472
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,700
Yeah,

473
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,540
see, that's definitely my first choice.

474
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,420
Yeah, right, it was their fault they went missing.

475
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:56,640
You know how this thing, like, if it passes, you have to find someone within, like, 48 hours, or more likely.

476
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,300
dead.

477
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,160
I'm just like, I can surely wait another day.

478
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,340
It's not, I still have like, that just means I have 24 hours left.

479
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,260
I'm just like, you know what?

480
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,980
We can't wait another day.

481
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,160
I still have time.

482
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,620
Yeah, you guys heard of this.

483
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:34,060
Yeah, apparently if someone goes missing, like, I don't know if it's 48 hours or more, but there's like a specific time frame, you have to find someone or they're more or less likely never, or no, like, be gone forever.

484
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,330
Alright.

485
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,110
Okay, tell me about this.

486
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,190
Yeah, first 48 or the trail goes cold.

487
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,770
I still have 48 hours.

488
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,990
They can wait another day.

489
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,590
Oh,

490
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,220
this is Lord Dome.

491
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,970
Oh, I saw this in the cutscene.

492
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,930
This was in the cutscene.

493
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,590
So, Aetherian is like when we're in that VR headspace.

494
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:38,890
Wait, what are the flaws?

495
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,730
Wait, I'm beta testing?

496
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,670
I don't like how I'm beta testing, like, my mind.

497
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,230
That seems like a really dangerous beta test.

498
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,710
This, thank you for the rate.

499
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,110
Thank you.

500
00:42:59,370 --> 00:42:59,790
Thank you.

501
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,030
We had a good stream.

502
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:20,510
Oh, so that's That's how they become monsters.

503
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,590
Oh, so like, if you're the...

504
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,990
If you get...

505
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,790
So even...

506
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,590
Okay, so that could happen to me.

507
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,590
Wait, this is actually really dangerous.

508
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,070
Why am I doing this?

509
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:41,790
Genesia's Inkyouka- See, being a game tester is really hard.

510
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:42,890
You could...

511
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,310
That's actually messed up.

512
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,770
Like, you're just being a game tester.

513
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:46,790
You're doing, like, QN...

514

Like, the quality testing.

00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:54,130
There's like a 50% chance you'll mutate into a freaky monster.

516
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,790

Okay.

525
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,670
Do we need to know about them?

526
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,370

527
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:48,610

00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:53,810
I don't want to know.

531
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,590
I like that it's not labeled or anything.

532
00:44:59,150 --> 00:44:59,550
Alright.

533
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,750

534
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,330
What me and her have.

535
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,750
Because I'm scared she'll, like, say something that...

536
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,270

I miss every 10 summons.

592
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,460

00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:55,450
Oh, I can't level it up.

616
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,650
Did I use up all my money?

617
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,950
Oh my god.

618
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,130
I hope I didn't accidentally use up all my money.

619
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,490
That would be so awkward.

620
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,030
Okay.

621
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:05,190
Okay.

622
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:06,330
It's only that.

623
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,710
Okay.

624
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:08,210
Thank god.

625
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,190
I was going to be like, that would be so awkward.

626
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,630
I accidentally used it all up.

627
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:14,230
Alright.

628
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,450
Before we do it.

629
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,290
I wanted to...

630
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:17,910
Where's the sentry?

631
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,170
How do I adjust?

632
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:21,870
Oh, there it is.

633
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:22,270
All right.

634
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,950
I can finally adjust the audio.

635
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,370
I've been waiting to do that.

636
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:26,850
All right.

637
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:28,150
Sound team.

638
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:32,270
I finally made it to the setting.

639
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,870
I finally made it to the settings.

640
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:40,670
I assume that it's...

641
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:45,370
I don't know if the voice volume affects the...

642
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,910
Because, like, the cutscene audio.

643
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:48,510
it's fine.

644
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,570
It's just the battle.

645
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,270
The battle that the voice lines are very loud.

646
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:58,030
So, like, I don't know if this affects the cut scene voiceover as well.

647
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,730
Is it okay throughout it?

648
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,970
Okay, we'll just keep that then, for now.

649
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,410
Just want to be sure.

650
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,630
The battle, okay, is it the battle sound effects then?

651
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,550
I'll put that at 85.

652
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,110
I'll put that at 85 for now.

653
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,810
Or 87, because I can't be bothered to do it.

654
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,890
Should change it.

655
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:21,830
Alright, continue game.

656
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,990
Wait, how do I use my code?

657
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:27,130
Chat.

658
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,670
Do you know how to use my code?

659
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,790
I thought that says Riz.

660
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:38,870

664
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:54,270
Like, apparently if there's More, like, I don't seem desperate, right?

665
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:04,650
Like, the amount of wise determines how desperate you look.

666
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,810
A very normal introduction.

667
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,170

668
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:11,610

How do I use my code?

678
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:39,510
Do you guys know?

679
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,230

Where's my mail?

692
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,230
Wait, I don't even have how do I check my mail?

693
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,930
I can't even check my, can I check my email?

694
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,930
I have to complete chapter one, three.

695
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,190
I didn't lock the other of my email.

696
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,910
They're like, oh, we have so suspicious activity.

697
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:53,570
You were logged in, um, in a different location, so we have to lock Your email real quick.

698
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,310
Like, it's time to go to the campaign.

699
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,350
I don't have...

700
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:04,190
I have to contact the IT department to unlock my email for me.

701
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:06,690
Alright.

702
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:07,050
Oh!

703
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:08,790
I like all the free stuff.

704
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:23,490
You're like, Do you remember the missing kids?

705
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:26,810
I was like, oh yeah!

706
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,950
The missing kids I'm supposed to find.

707
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,090
Them.

708
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,190
Wait,

709
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,450
I forgot to equip my fourth girl.

710
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:51,730
Oh, there we go.

711
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:56,450
No, we've seen a sign to my team.

712
00:55:58,830 --> 00:55:59,470
Oh, there we go.

713
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,510
No, we've seen a sign to my team.

714
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:02,390
Yeah!

715
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,030
Yeah!

716
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,270
Finally some backup.

717
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:10,970
Finally a real woman.

718
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,410
That's easy enough.

719
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,210
Chaco, chaco.

720
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:47,070
All right, we gotta rescue the children.

721
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,290
Is the pay really that bad to be like short-handed?

722
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:16,630
I mean, to be fair.

723
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:20,590
There's not really a lot of benefits, though, to be part of the Bureau.

724
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:26,030
Because there's, like, a chance you can turn into, like, a Genesis creature.

725
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:35,010
Like, the 50-50 chance.

726
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,790
The gamble is a bit too much.

727
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:40,810
Oh, Yang!

728
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,550
We just saw him.

729
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:45,730
Oh,

730
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:49,510
it was really...

731
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,610
That was the dog.

732
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,890
...

733
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:52,130
...

734
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:52,290
...

735
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:52,490
...

736
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:53,950
...

737
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:53,990
...

738
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:13,810
We have no leads on them.

739
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:24,990
Oh,

740
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,090
Matara, thank you for the raid!

741
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:31,210
Thank you.

742
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,050
I hope you had a good stream, Matara.

743
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:35,290
Thank you so much.

744
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:42,290
I'm just playing, I'm doing Aetheria restart right now for a sponsor.

745
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,210
interesting.

746
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,470
It's a strategy turn-based RPG.

747
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,650
Also, has Matara been Mega Bunk yet?

748
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,850
I told her to try it out.

749
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,580
Because I know it's like, I know she'll get super addicted to it.

750
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,090
Oh, she will tomorrow.

751
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,010
It's so fun.

752
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,030
It's so addicting.

753
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:07,210
Also, I found out that Mega Chat is actually the worst character in the game.

754
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:11,490
It's the worst character in the game.

755
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,610
But he's with Chad.

756
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,190
I don't understand.

757
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,610
How could he be the worst if he has aura?

758
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:26,670
Alright.

759
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,950
Oh wait, they're talking.

760
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:46,610
Hey.

761
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,830
I just just want to be involved in the conversation.

762
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,250
Oh shit, forgot the...

763
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,230
Oh shit, I was too busy texting.

764
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,370
Don't text.

765
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:03,450
Don't text text itself, guys.

766
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:11,430
I bumped into the guy because I was too busy texting and I was too busy texting.

767
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,210
Don't text and fight.

768
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,930
Oh, nice.

769
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:16,370
Auto.

770
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:17,630
Well, auto.

771
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,170
Let's see how smart my AI is.

772
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,110
Oh, very smart.

773
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:23,710
They actually know how to play.

774
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,310
Wait, I want to see her moves.

775
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:28,230
Oh, my God.

776
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:29,490
She's so strong.

777
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,430
She, wait, she should have moved first.

778
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:35,450
Don't text and turn.

779
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,030
Why didn't she move first?

780
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,710
Has strong enemy energy fluctuation, which might be used for the animuses.

781
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:48,850
I almost clicked skip.

782
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:50,230
Module.

783
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:53,050
That's the only you can eliminate power boost from the module.

784
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,650
Let's begin on the first open slot.

785
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:56,010
All right.

786
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,830
I'm gonna give you a mask.

787
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,610
And then onslaught.

788
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:04,410
Oh, this is a tutorial.

789
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:05,950
I almost like skipped this.

790
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:06,910
It was like...

791
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,870
Wait, that means I would have actually let the children die.

792
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:15,630
I just realized This is the...

793
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,830
I would have actually made the...

794
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,730
I would have actually let the kids die if I didn't do the tutorial.

795
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,210
I just realized that.

796
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:23,990
That's really messed up.

797
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:24,850
There you go.

798
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:28,510
Get punched.

799
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,610
Right behind you.

800
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:31,730
Wait, what's over there though?

801
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:33,290
I knew it.

802
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:34,370
I knew it was an item.

803
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:37,230
Yeah.

804
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:39,870
What a year.

805
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,930
Yeah, what a year!

806
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,020
Oh, chest.

807
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,520
Nice, I got all of that.

808
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,440
I guess we go to this.

809
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,680
Oh, that's weird.

810
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,300
This wall speaks.

811
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,780
Wait, did anyone reply back to me?

812
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,820
Why is everyone ignoring me?

813
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:17,020
This, like, random person in the group chat that has, like, that, like, just types it in every, like, a couple of months, and it's, like, not.

814
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:25,070
even part of not even like the same as the conversation you're just saying hey

815
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:52,170
wait uh let me double check okay sound got set to turn voices down a little bit so i'll turn it to 85 just turn voices down because it's like the voices are in japanese anyway so Unless you guys know Japanese.

816
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:00,590
All right.

817
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:02,110
Battle.

818
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,550
Okay, I don't want to watch them fight.

819
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,430
You can be your buffs and debuffs.

820
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:11,670
Oh, this is the buffs.

821
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:13,170
Oh, wait, wait.

822
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:13,570
Okay.

823
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,870
I want to see Yen's attack.

824
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,650
Okay.

825
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:20,750
Do your thing, Yen!

826
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:25,110
Wait, they live?

827
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,590
Okay, never mind, auto.

828
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,770
That's like, never mind, it's I...

829
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:33,970
They're still alive.

830
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:35,030
I trust my AI.

831
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,350
I thought I could one-shot them.

832
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:40,890
But I trust my AI to make the good decision.

833
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,990
Oh, is it because they're water type?

834
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,630
Oh, wait, they're water type.

835
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:46,150
Okay, that makes sense.

836
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:48,730
Oh, I have my little cat buddy.

837
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,230
Nice.

838
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,270
They're so strong!

839
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:55,690
Wait, I blocked it.

840
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:56,710
Pew pew!

841
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:03,410
Boom, thank you for gifting us up to Batara!

842
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,670
Thank you, thank you!

843
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:05,350
Yay!

844
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,330
I did it!

845
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:12,010
Ring!

846
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:16,710
Genesis's new armor ...

847
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:17,010
...

848
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,360
But there's red.

849
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,720
Oh, they're not the mutated form.

850
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:26,560
She's cute.

851
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,240
I like her design.

852
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:35,180
I did it all on my own.

853
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,100
Do you not see it when I like press buttons on the end?

854
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,900
I'm such a tactical genius.

855
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,120
Yes, exactly.

856
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,200
All of me.

857
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:03,100
I mean, you should be around.

858
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,300
He has a dog with him.

859
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,960
Oh, there he is.

860
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,500
There's a dog.

861
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:14,800
Oh, his name is Adul.

862
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,500
Oh, whoa.

863
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,440
That's cute.

864
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:33,100

866
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:06,790
Don't worry, these two children will keep you a grown adult very safe.

867
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,390
He's a student!

868
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,450
Oh my god, is it one of the things where these two are actually not children?

869
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,710
We're like 50-year-old.

870
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,570
Holy shit!

871
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:21,970
Oh wait, he is a student!

872
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,290
He's wearing shorts!

873
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:23,970
Look at him!

874
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:25,270
He's wearing student shorts!

875
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,170
Actually, I just realized, wait, they're kids.

876
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,510
Why are we sending kids out to fight?

877
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,590
He said, just clicked in my head.

878
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:40,110
Wait, they're children.

879
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,150
I'm making kids fight for me.

880
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:43,830
Yay!

881
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,110
Oh, so he hasn't.

882
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:59,250
Hasn't gotten mutated yet.

883
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,950
He won the 50-50.

884
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:05,170
Level D.

885
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:11,950
That's so sad.

886
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:14,110
He's weak as fuck.

887
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:16,850
Bro, he's just...

888
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:21,290
You're so weak that we can't even detect your power level.

889
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:23,330
Just like me.

890
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:25,970
Yeah!

891
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:27,270
Bro!

892
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:30,590
Put your pizza guy down!

893
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,510
Deeper don't keep dollar store powers!

894
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:36,950
Don't edit all these days!

895
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,850
Energy shaving him!

896
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:40,550
Damn!

897
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:45,450
Are you even special in- Is it because you have a dog?

898
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:51,890
Did he just get it because he had a dog?

899
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:55,570
He's already dead.

900
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:05,510
Oh, it's because of the dog you only got it because of your dog.

901
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:07,070
That's so sad.

902
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,730
He's like, whoa, whoa.

903
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:16,850
He's, guys, he's the actual student, I feel like.

904
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,870
He's the student and he's just the plus one.

905
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:23,330
I didn't even want him.

906
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:30,390
CSA, half of them low power is okay.

907
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,950
You don't get to turn into the mutants.

908
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,750
The principal only wanted the dog back.

909
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:53,250
It's like, if Yang, it doesn't matter about Yang, we just want the dog.

910
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,710
We just want to make sure the dog's safe.

911
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:08,390
That girl is trouble.

912
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,630
Oh, it's you mad!

913
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,690
I want this guy!

914
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,870
I want this guy in my party!

915
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:27,460
Why have I heard of such a train before?

916
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,580
There's a special train?

917
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,420
For special people?

918
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,920
Since you're human, it's understandable you haven't.

919
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,640
Yeah, the game's been interesting so far.

920
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,300
The plot has been pretty interesting.

921
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,540
I like how like...

922
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,600
I like the dog.

923
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,180
I like how he's...

924
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:09,720
I think so far, definitely love how she was like, why are you here?

925
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,320
You're not that special.

926
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,300
That's crazy.

927
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,620
They're so wild.

928
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,020
Oh, there is!

929
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,960
The connector was an animus named Obo.

930
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,480
There's him.

931
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,040
Oh,

932
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,640
did the dog turn into a monster?

933
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,160
Yeah.

934
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,920
A mutated dog.

935
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,580
Oh.

936
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,220
Oh.

937
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:47,640
Oh.

938
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:47,800
Oh.

939
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:48,020
Oh.

940
01:10:51,460 --> 01:11:00,260
I want to see you just have to wait for the next train.

941
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,420
Chak chak.

942
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:04,640
Chakku.

943
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:06,000
I'm scared.

944
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:07,520
I'm scared.

945
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,380
I'm mad at you.

946
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,580
I'm mad at you.

947
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,440
Oh, my.

948
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,400
Right,

949
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:25,280
they didn't even smell bad.

950
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:32,820
They just stopped taking baths and showers after they mutated.

951
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:42,900
I'm meaning my egg chart.

952
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,020
I got three.

953
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,560
I love Danka.

954
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,280
It's called Aura.

955
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:52,780
True.

956
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,480
girl.

957
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:08,670
Oh,

958
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,830
now I want to make sure she's okay.

959
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:21,390
It was like, she's trouble.

960
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:22,590
We split up.

961
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:36,670
Bro, he's level D.

962
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:38,270
What can he do?

963
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:47,630
Oh, wait.

964
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:50,350
I can have the dog.

965
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:52,530
Yeah, I was going to say, I can send the dog out.

966
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:53,030
Easy.

967
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:53,810
Hi.

968
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:01,990
Alright, let's ship the dog out.

969
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,520
Dog all imported.

970
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,380
Oh, ship the train!

971
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,460
Oh my god!

972
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,180
Wait, he's gone.

973
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,640
What the- Oh!

974
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:25,770
Wait, what?

975
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,290
What about my other animuses?

976
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,630
Do I just, like, carry him?

977
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,510
I guess they're, like, stuck in my pocket.

978
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:44,750
God, look at that good boy.

979
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:49,290
What's the dog doing?

980
01:13:53,790 --> 01:14:24,750
If you guys are enjoying the game so far, feel free to click on the link pinned in my what the heck why are there dead people on this train wait i didn't it's genesis there's sharing genesis reaction oh yeah but if you guys are if you guys are enjoying this game so far feel free to click the link pinned in my chat or on my panel um and use the code ethereum0925 for free 10 free pause woo free stuff it'll help for the

981
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:38,110
Oh, it's because it's always moving, so they couldn't find the storage, so that makes sense.

982
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:45,730
Yeah,

983
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,350
you click the link!

984
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,130
She might know something.

985
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:55,830
Yeah, because she was the first one to get drawn into the train.

986
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:58,090
Why did the dog want to go?

987
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,110
Go to the train.

988
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:21,290
We'll have to search car by car.

989
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:22,530
Let's split up, gang.

990
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:25,970
Actually, no.

991
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:31,150
But which who's Scooby and Shaggy though in the script?

992
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:32,150
Oh, wait!

993
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:33,670
Ying!

994
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,350
I was like, no, let's split up, Ging.

995
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:40,290
Let's- Not though.

996
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:47,650
Ying is obviously Scooby and Shaggy.

997
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:56,310
It's actually perfect.

998
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,130
Oh my god, what?

999
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,830
I was gonna be like, are you buffering?

1000
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:01,870
Did you not get fiber?

1001
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:08,010
She's like, somebody's downloading something on the router right now.

1002
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:13,010
No, my AI girlfriend!

1003
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,550
They patched a new update!

1004
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:20,470
Now she doesn't say good morning to me anymore.

1005
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:25,850
Just be like, what do you want, Toki?

1006
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:27,890
Oh.

1007
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:29,950
BAM!

1008
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:31,270
There you go.

1009
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:34,110
I like how ambushes just casually walk up behind them.

1010
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:34,770
Oh, wait.

1011
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:38,490
Now that's what I would have done if I had to stealth.

1012
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:40,950
Watch this.

1013
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,070
BAM!

1014
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:49,630
BAM!

1015
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:50,850
Oh, shit.

1016
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:51,470
Is he not there?

1017
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:52,510
Oh, it's like...

1018
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:52,990
I just...

1019
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:53,670
Does he have like...

1020
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:54,410
Do I just go first?

1021
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:55,910
I must go first, right?

1022
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:58,110
Um...

1023
01:16:58,110 --> 01:16:59,730
If I hit him first.

1024
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,470
Uh, battle!

1025
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:09,490
You changed ever since the other day.

1026
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:10,550
She's so distant.

1027
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,950
Trock is so distant to me now.

1028
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:18,890
Okay, we're gonna grab this chest.

1029
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:20,630
Open sesame.

1030
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:22,930
Oh nice, that's like upgrades.

1031
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,250
Alright, he's hacking.

1032
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,330
Chako, do your thing!

1033
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:36,990
Yeah,

1034
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:44,070
he's definitely the shaggy of the group.

1035
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:48,170
Oh, where did I go?

1036
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:50,110
Up?

1037
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:50,930
Oh, up.

1038
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:52,610
Up time.

1039
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,210
Wait, how do I self that?

1040
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:56,070
Where's the cover?

1041
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:58,390
Don't worry.

1042
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,090
Oh, I was going to see him.

1043
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:01,090
Maybe he won't see.

1044
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:02,410
me

1045
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:32,210
it's okay i can one oh guys guys i did in one shot it might not be okay anymore it might not be okay anymore i i i thought it'd be different jesus okay one One of them is still stunned.

1046
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:33,110
That's good.

1047
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:37,970
Okay, we have to get rid of the big boy.

1048
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:42,230
No, it's not over, guys.

1049
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:43,510
I have a healer.

1050
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:46,250
Okay, it might be a little over, but it's still not over.

1051
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,930
I mean, they're like, what the...

1052
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:52,870
What's your damage?

1053
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:54,750
Oh yeah, Lien.

1054
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,990
Lien coming in for the clutch.

1055
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:00,910
...

1056
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,950
It's not over.

1057
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,190
Guys, land- Oh!

1058
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:05,090
Where am I?

1059
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:09,170
There was a hole?

1060
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:14,370
.

1061
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,670
These enemies hate men.

1062
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,470
Oh yeah, they all focused on him.

1063
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,190
.

1064
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:22,270
.

1065
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:23,810
Yeah, they all focused on him.

1066
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:24,970
.

1067
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:24,990
.

1068
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:25,010
.

1069
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:25,070
.

1070
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:25,370
.

1071
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:33,990
It's a hidden data track?

1072
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:36,390
Oh, wait, are there like extra items?

1073
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:46,470
Yeah, maybe the D-Rank guy does need protection.

1074
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,030
A person virus?

1075
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:10,630
person as in me or oh obo no not obo how would i pull him if he's evil

1076
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:22,970
there's no way i there's no way he's evil because i can play him as a character not the old man

1077
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:32,790
I mean, he seems okay.

1078
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,610
I mean, he's dead, but at least he's not a mutant.

1079
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:37,910
At least he's not a monster.

1080
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,150
But he looks okay.

1081
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:46,950
Oh, no.

1082
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:47,770
Oh, he's a...

1083
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:48,490
Oh, never mind.

1084
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,870
He's a natural real human.

1085
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,950
Oh, that's an actual dead guy.

1086
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:55,370
Okay.

1087
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:59,350
I thought, like, they were talking about the animuses.

1088
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,710
Rael, thank you for tier one, so thank you.

1089
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:04,650
Thank you.

1090
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:14,430
I was like a monster, like a regular animus.

1091
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:20,430
I'm Yang.

1092
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:22,770
Yang is me.

1093
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:38,770
That's true.

1094
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,130
He kept the train running.

1095
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:44,710
Does that mean...

1096
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:46,890
Does that mean Obo will join me?

1097
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:49,730
Friends, thank you for the 20 gifted subs!

1098
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,130
Thank you, thank you!

1099
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:54,990
We find Valorant for more money.

1100
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:58,870
Thank you again.

1101
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:00,670
I really appreciate it.

1102
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:02,150
And what does he want?

1103
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:09,590
You.

1104
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:12,290
Oh, you're welcome.

1105
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:13,950
I was like, first message.

1106
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:16,690
It's like, me!

1107
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:17,310
Yeah

1108
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:38,950
Oh, he has something to hide we can't even hack it wait That means you're a bad hacker.

1109
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:40,670
He's so old.

1110
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:45,070
There's no way you can like have a fucking program That's that secure

1111
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:52,190
What?

1112
01:22:58,990 --> 01:22:59,990
Why would they detach?

1113
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:05,030
Yeah, who started it?

1114
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:09,310
Oh, keeping us away from the source.

1115
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:13,290
I think that's like a red, what's it called, a red herring?

1116
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:16,210
Like they keep saying obo, but it has to be someone else.

1117
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:17,570
he's involved.

1118
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,090
Because there's no...

1119
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:31,370
Like, it keeps me like, Obo, Obo, Obo.

1120
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:33,370
It makes me feel like it's not Obo.

1121
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:36,290
Because it's too easy.

1122
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,890
Like, misdirection.

1123
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:40,310
Yeah.

1124
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:41,790
Oh, wait.

1125
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:43,170
We didn't even go to another train.

1126
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:46,510
Oh, um...

1127
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:49,890
You can download the launcher on the website.

1128
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:52,410
It's not out on Steam, but they have their own launcher.

1129
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:57,150
So if you click on the link, it takes you to the website.

1130
01:23:58,410 --> 01:23:59,250
...

1131
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,010
...

1132
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:00,490
...

1133
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:00,870
...

1134
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:01,650
...

1135
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:01,970
...

1136
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:03,270
...

1137
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:03,290
...

1138
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:03,830
...

1139
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:04,110
...

1140
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:06,270
...

1141
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:07,070
...

1142
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:26,110
Yeah, Kazami has to be on the train.

1143
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:36,550
Wait, so how do we get to that train, though?

1144
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:43,050
Okay, it's dangerous to linger here.

1145
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:44,750
Yeah, we have to find a safe place.

1146
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,670
Just wait at the station.

1147
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:51,790
Surely it'll be fine.

1148
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:01,890
Oh,

1149
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:11,410
oh, oh, self-time.

1150
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:15,250
Oh, I don't know how close he can get to me.

1151
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:17,150
F.

1152
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:17,890
Oh.

1153
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:18,410
Oh.

1154
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:19,650
Nice.

1155
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:24,500
Bam!

1156
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,080
Yoyink!

1157
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,200
Got your heart.

1158
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,260
Sneaky sneaky.

1159
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:33,560
Oh yeah.

1160
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,380
I'm so good at this strategy thing.

1161
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,020
Look at me go!

1162
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:42,520
Yay!

1163
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,520
I did that.

1164
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,300
Yeah.

1165
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,620
I'm a natural, I'm a tactical genius.

1166
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,500
I literally wrote the art of war.

1167
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,600
It's, it's Sundoki.

1168
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:14,060
You know how it's like, Sunse, but it's actually like, the D is silent.

1169
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,040
It's dark now.

1170
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:19,800
Don,

1171
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:34,350
Oh, wait, she's infected.

1172
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:38,690
Oh, she's getting infected.

1173
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:39,910
She's got a mutate.

1174
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:45,970
Oh, she's glitching out.

1175
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:52,310
Oh, shit.

1176
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,090
Look at those giant ass hands.

1177
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:55,130

Nice, the heals clutch.

1186
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,080
They invested in the wrong stats.

1187
01:27:47,860 --> 01:28:14,980
Jesus wait you're level 20 and you do that much damage Yeah, okay, we can yeah, we can beat her I'm gonna say this is winnable This is winnable now They invested in the rock They've invested in like luck or some shit Yeah, I feel like They put it all on luck And zero damage I was like Oh my god,

She's level two.

01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:28,390
Yeah, level five!

1191
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:29,690
Do we fix her?

1192
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:30,870
We just beat her up.

1193
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:33,590
Okay, Genesis.

1194
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:34,590
Well, that's it?

1195
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:39,950
If we just beat people up, they'll like get the Genesis away?

1196
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:43,570
It's just that easy?

1197
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:45,410
Why don't we just do that to all the monsters?

1198
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,070
Oh,

1199
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:57,040
she's a teacher's pet.

1200
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:01,130
I don't like her anymore.

1201
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:09,070
Maxi, thank you for the hundred bitties.

1202
01:29:09,290 --> 01:29:09,870
Thank you, thank you.

1203
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,950
Yeah, she's Hama under energy.

1204
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:15,130
Wait, but she looks like...

1205
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:20,030
I will encourage you to break the rules.

1206
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:37,330
She's all too doky.

1207
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:42,110
Okay, Lee?

1208
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:42,750
Why?

1209
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:49,070
Zara, doky?

1210
01:29:51,850 --> 01:30:10,160
the doki that didn't learn didn't learn about gaming oh uncle oboe oh he's oh he did did he actually get corrupted by the genesis oji-san oh she used oji-san too

1211
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:19,970
doki that can't read

1212
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:35,350
I'm not even going to defend myself for that.

1213
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:36,690
That's a good statement.

1214
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:43,730
Oh, he is infected.

1215
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:46,770
I thought it was like a misdirection.

1216
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:55,350
Yeah,

1217
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:01,630
I can do that for her.

1218
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:02,950
I should be able to do that for him.

1219
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:13,870
I like how both of these answers are basically, yeah, we do it.

1220
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:17,410
I was like, what if I can...

1221
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:18,710
Is there an option for me to say no?

1222
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:20,590
I was like, I learned...

1223
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:21,830

1232
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:43,610

What's the word?

1236
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:48,670
Scripted?

1237
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:52,010
Is it scripted or like new for every person?

1238
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:53,750
For the free summon.

1239
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:54,930
Oh, it's that guy.

1240
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:56,650

1241
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:57,230

1242
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:58,990

1246
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:08,310
Oh, it's not scripted.

1247
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:10,410

Or should I use it on something else?

1366

I don't understand.

1444
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:35,820
The only woman I got was scripted.

1445
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,980
It's not fair.

1446
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,940
It's not fair.

1447
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:45,120
I'm actually made a list.

1448
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:46,980
What did I do?

1449
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:51,520
I got four more pulls.

1450
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:53,880
There's still hope.

1451
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:57,100
There's actually still hope.

1452
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,760
I have four more.

1453
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:05,520
One at a time.

1454
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:09,140
Ashu.

1455
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:10,820
It's okay.

1456
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,000
One at a time.

1457
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:13,940
There's still hope.

1458
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:16,540
There's still hope I can get one maiden.

1459
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:22,920
I can't believe it's five out of five.

1460
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:25,440
It's just, oh man.

1461
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:26,600
Oh my god.

1462
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,240
Oh my god, it's 10.

1463
01:50:28,340 --> 01:50:28,920

01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,540
I was going to be like, what if?

1465
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,340
Wait, there's still hope.

1466
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:33,980
I'll use it on her.

1467
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,080
Guaranteed limited SS.

1468
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,740
Okay, maybe Freya.

1469
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,140
Maybe there's still hope.

1470
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:42,000
There's still hope.

1471
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:43,560
Maybe I can get her.

1472
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:47,480
And then she's a guaranteed SSR.

1473
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:56,000
Oh my god, it's blue on 87th.

1474
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:56,700

01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:34,730
It's not over!

1546
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:37,270

01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:44,790
Not over.

1550
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:51,490

01:55:55,190 --> 01:55:56,790

At this point.

01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:02,930

That's like, there's no way I can get more guys.

1575
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:38,920
That was good.

1576
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:43,360
No maiden showed up, so I had to make my own.

1577
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:49,520
I can't believe, I can't believe I got a double of the guy.

1578
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,400
That's my bro sheet.

1579
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:57,140
Andrew!

1580
01:58:00,710 --> 01:58:05,010
So we have lucky, no luck, and turkey luck.

1581
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:07,650
Wait, I can convert my gems into pulls?

1582
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:10,950
Wait, I can?

1583
01:58:11,230 --> 01:58:12,910
How many pulls do I get?

1584
01:58:14,270 --> 01:58:15,130
Oh, a thousand?

1585
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:17,070
Oh my god, I get ten more pulls.

1586
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:18,490
I get ten more pulls.

1587
01:58:18,650 --> 01:58:19,130
This is it.

1588
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:20,450
This is it.

1589
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:22,410
I might be able to have a real maiden.

1590
01:58:23,210 --> 01:58:25,050
I didn't build for myself.

1591
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:26,690
Oh my god.

1592
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:59,230

A robot wife and a real woman.

1594
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:04,550
Oh my.

1595
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:08,270
I was like, I can't believe it's almost the last one too.

1596
01:59:09,590 --> 01:59:10,570
Oh my god.

1597
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:12,710
We actually got a waifu.

1598
01:59:13,090 --> 01:59:14,930
I have game chat.

1599
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:16,270
I told you.

1600
01:59:17,190 --> 01:59:19,250
I fixed myself, guys.

1601
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:20,410
Oh, free.

1602
01:59:20,490 --> 01:59:21,310
Oh, there it is.

1603
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:23,870
There's the free one.

1604
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:25,370
Which one's the other free one?

1605
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:26,870
Someone said, oh, there it is.

1606
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:28,150
That's the free.

1607
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:28,530
Pull.

1608
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:29,850
Right there.

1609
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:31,570
Another free pull.

1610
01:59:34,610 --> 01:59:35,070
Never.

1611
01:59:35,210 --> 01:59:37,170
I can change, guys.

1612
01:59:37,610 --> 01:59:38,010
See?

1613
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:41,290
I can change for the better.

1614
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:44,350
The weekly pack.

1615
01:59:44,430 --> 01:59:45,310
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

1616
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:47,230
Wait, someone said I could exchange.

1617
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:48,550
I can grab more.

1618
01:59:50,150 --> 01:59:51,530
Gems for it, can't I?

1619
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:54,850
I already grabbed these two.

1620
01:59:56,030 --> 01:59:57,050
Or, like, not these two.

1621
01:59:57,110 --> 01:59:57,830
Oh, here it is.

1622
01:59:58,270 --> 01:59:59,150
10 pulls.

1623
01:59:59,390 --> 01:59:59,810
Is this one?

1624
02:00:01,530 --> 02:00:02,670
Is this one, right?

1625
02:00:04,290 --> 02:00:05,210
Oh my god.

1626
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:08,230
We can do another one.

1627
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:11,950
Oh, wait, not this one.

1628
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:14,930
So many free pulls.

1629
02:00:15,330 --> 02:00:16,310
I love free stuff.

1630
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:19,470
We got another one.

1631
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:21,510
Oh my god.

1632
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:22,470
I told you guys.

1633
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:23,690
Probability wise.

1634
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:25,350
I knew.

1635
02:00:25,790 --> 02:00:27,450
Eventually I'll hit the women.

1636
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:31,870
Eventually, there's not enough men for me to get.

1637
02:00:35,650 --> 02:00:40,070
There's not enough men for me to get.

1638
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:41,610
There's no way.

1639
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:46,250
Wait, hold on.

1640
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:46,850
Yes!

1641
02:00:47,010 --> 02:00:47,990
Oh my god, I got Kazami!

1642
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:49,250
Oh my god!

1643
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:49,890
Yes!

1644
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:53,090
We did it!

1645
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:55,860
It's me!

1646
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:58,160
The joki that can read.

1647
02:00:58,500 --> 02:00:59,620
The curse is bad.

1648
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:00,240
broken.

1649
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,740
I can't change, guys.

1650
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:05,780
I can't change.

1651
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:07,120
No, it wasn't me.

1652
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:07,920
It's not me.

1653
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:08,720
It was them.

1654
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:14,460
The other women didn't know what they were missing out.

1655
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:20,860
Oh!

1656
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:27,240
Oh my god, too?

1657
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,560
They're coming back begging to be on my team.

1658
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,640
They knew they messed up.

1659
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:40,660
The curse.

1660
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:43,820
Because I think I have even amount of men and women now.

1661
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:45,580
Yay!

1662
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:48,000
We did it.

1663
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,520
We actually did it.

1664
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:51,040
Oh, she's cute.

1665
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,120
What is she?

1666
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:55,940
I like it.

1667
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:56,560
She's cute.

1668
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:57,840
Virtuous maiden.

1669
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:00,660
I like her design.

1670
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:01,340
Yay!

1671
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:02,880
Gender equality!

1672
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:04,360
Finally!

1673
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:09,220
Fucking finally!

1674
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:16,560
We're no longer maidenless, perfectly balanced as all things should be.

1675
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:17,520
That's crazy.

1676
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:24,060
That's actually crazy that that like five out of five were just all guys.

1677
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:24,680
Yeah!

1678
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:26,600
Yeah!

1679
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:28,800
Yeah!

1680
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:35,580
Izuki, I think my favorite one?

1681
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:38,120
Oh man, she's cute too.

1682
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:39,860
Valerian?

1683
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:41,800
I think...

1684
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:43,940
I don't like Kazami, I'm sorry.

1685
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:47,440
I don't like her because she can read.

1686
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:56,600
The first woman had to text you to make sure you were normal to hang around the other woman.

1687
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,540
Toki, I love yourself though.

1688
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:20,870
I can't believe it Toki only was That's not true I like her She's a scientist Guys She's a scientist I like her

1689
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:32,150
Oh apparently there's like Okay there's a PvP mode.

1690
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:34,310
I don't know which one is that.

1691
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:36,990
Because I don't know which mode that is.

1692
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:38,530
How do we play that mode?

1693
02:03:40,230 --> 02:03:43,070
Animus, summon, achievement, the hyperlink chart.

1694
02:03:43,150 --> 02:03:44,110
Oh, is it this one?

1695
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:45,950
I have to unlock it?

1696
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:47,970
How does it take to unlock it, chat?

1697
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:50,470
Oh, 6-3.

1698
02:03:50,770 --> 02:03:52,310
Okay, I don't think we're...

1699
02:03:52,310 --> 02:03:53,990
I don't think we're unlocking it.

1700
02:03:55,130 --> 02:03:57,650
So you complete chapter 6.

1701
02:03:58,710 --> 02:04:04,670
You can do a PvP mode where you can pick Like, where you can fight against other real players.

1702
02:04:05,170 --> 02:04:07,450
So, like, it's not just, like, in the story.

1703
02:04:07,770 --> 02:04:10,750
So, yeah, I just have to actually, like, you know, min-max your team and everything.

1704
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:12,390
In the PvP mode.

1705
02:04:12,450 --> 02:04:15,290
Which is pretty exciting, because you have to fight real players and everything.

1706
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:17,650
And there's also, like, a balancing system.

1707
02:04:18,090 --> 02:04:20,270
So that everything will be fair and stuff.

1708
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:23,270
And they, uh, uh, with regular updates.

1709
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:25,230
Oh, there's a pick and ban phase?

1710
02:04:25,890 --> 02:04:28,470
Oh, they do pick and ban phase, too.

1711
02:04:28,890 --> 02:05:03,220
So, like, they, you can, like, you have to be, like, strategic with it as well yeah because you gotta be like okay um i'm gonna ban this and then i'm gonna ban that because this character's op with that character so that you actually have to like um yeah for the real time you actually have to like think about what you want to ban oh i have more stuff wait oh do they have claim all i don't claim all did it oh they done wait do i have more pose Oh my god,

I have so many now.

1714
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:08,920
Okay, wait.

1715
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:10,180
I think I might have another pull.

1716
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:12,140
Maybe.

1717
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:13,580
Okay, we gotta claim that.

1718
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:16,800
Guys, it's the dailies.

1719
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,220
I'm claiming my dailies real quick.

1720
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:20,900
Battle.

1721
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:27,010
Oh, no.

1722
02:05:27,070 --> 02:05:27,730
I don't have that.

1723
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:29,970
And we can't get more.

1724
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:31,350

1725
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:34,590
Okay, so that's the dailies.

1726

For the achievement.

1727
02:05:35,530 --> 02:05:36,030
What's the path?

1728
02:05:37,150 --> 02:05:39,270
Oh, they have a hyperlink pass.

1729
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:40,730
So it's like a battle pass.

1730
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:45,650
I'll clean the free stuff.

1731
02:05:45,970 --> 02:05:47,770
So they have their own battle pass, too.

1732
02:05:49,490 --> 02:05:50,890
Keep collecting to get more pulls.

1733
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:53,530
If I collect more, I get more pulls.

1734
02:05:55,070 --> 02:05:57,270
And I think I just have to, like, defeat these people.

1735
02:05:57,450 --> 02:05:58,270
