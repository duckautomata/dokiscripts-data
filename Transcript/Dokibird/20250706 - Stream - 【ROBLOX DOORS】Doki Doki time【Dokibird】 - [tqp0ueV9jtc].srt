1
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,590
Everybody, hello, hello.

2
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,510
I'm sorry for being late.

3
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,770
I had to teach my child how to use VTube Studios.

4
00:01:52,690 --> 00:02:00,570
So apparently, TvDoki has never used the collab feature during, um, ever.

5
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:07,250
So she was like, I've been just screen sharing my, my model for the other.

6
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,730
Who are the other VTubers?

7
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,830
And I was like, what?

8
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,390
So I was giving, I was like, no, no, I'm not in a call yet.

9
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,130
I'm not in a call yet.

10
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,730
I'm roasting her a little bit before I call her.

11
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,650
Uh, don't worry, I'll roast her, I'll roast her in the call too.

12
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,490
But I just need to explain why I am a little late.

13
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,250
But basically, she's never used VTube Studios collab feature before.

14
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,750
So I was giving her like a step-by-step guide.

15
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,170
Uh, yeah, I revoked her speaking rights though.

16
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,550
Don't talk to me or my child again.

17
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:48,730
So I was giving her a step-by-step guide on how to like turn it on and, um, and everything.

18
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,950
So I'm taking my child to the beach.

19
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,390
Alright, I'm gonna call it, I'm gonna call it, uh, Chibi real quick.

20
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,730
Uh, alright, uh, sound guy, I hope you're ready because I...

21
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,590
I hope you're ready.

22
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,790
Uh, cause we definitely need to balance this.

23
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,430
Okay.

24
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,460
Hello!

25
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,520
Oh, wow, wow.

26
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,820
Hello, Chibi!

27
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,820
Hello, hello!

28
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,820
I heard you were roasting me on your stream.

29
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,020
Oh, I mean, you roasted yourself plenty enough.

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,040
Listen, listen, listen, I figured that out.

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,200
It took way longer than it should've, but I didn't.

32
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,520
Okay, wait, wait, wait, can I, alright, let me, can I read your chat message, what you said?

33
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,280
I...

34
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,700
Oh, how do I do that?

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,980
I was like, okay, so, alright, what's your Steam ID so we can set up a collab room?

36
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,620
What is a collab room?

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,980
Dude, that's, like, self-reporting, I get no YouTube review words, bro.

38
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,620
I'm not collaborating with anyone.

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,180
I was like, I was like, Chibi, it's been out, it's been a feature for at least a year now.

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,140
All those friends are 36-year-old men with dongs.

41
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,740
Like, I don't like...

42
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,520
Don't tell the cops that.

43
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,600
Don't...

44
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,700
Alright, hello everybody, this is Chibi Doki, and I am regular size Doki.

45
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,280
We're just the Doki Doki alliance.

46
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,080
Yeah, we're the Doki squared.

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,040
Uh, when people will be like, I like Chibi Doki, they're like, which one?

48
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,760
I know, do you have a big head toggle?

49
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
I can't turn that off.

50
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,720
Oh, wait, that's a big head?

51
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,920
I thought that was your regular size head.

52
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,480
No, no!

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,860
Hold up, wait, turn off.

54
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,020
This is my... Oh, I could do that too, wait.

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,080
Wait, can you really?

56
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,140
Yeah, I could do that too, give me a sec, I need to plug something in my...

57
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,700
Sorry, I need to plug my extender.

58
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,540
Just eat a pencil, that's what does it for me.

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,880
Don't talk to me or my child again.

60
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,460
She's born!

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,820
Alright, don't worry, watch this.

62
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,680
There you go.

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,760
She ate a Prinkles can!

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,800
I'm taking my daughter to the beach right now, guys.

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,540
Yeah, guys, guess where I get my next one.

66
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,180
She has a little floaty or she'll die.

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,260
Without the floaty, she literally sinks down.

68
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,720
She's like a fucking giant ass rock, so she'll sink down the ocean.

69
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,620
My head is just a ball of lead.

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,340
Yeah, so you put this child into the ocean, she'll fall straight into the... straight to the bottom.

71
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,460
Why are you gonna pump me?

72
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,760
You're also very puntable, so be careful.

73
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,040
Yeah, yeah, kick the baby.

74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,900
Kick the baby.

75
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,180
Plan C, motherfucker.

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,500
But yeah, you can see the family resemblance, right?

77
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,220
I was so excited, because when you DM'd me, you're like, hey, do you want to play something?

78
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,820
You're like so good at games.

79
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
I was like, oh no, she's going to want to play like Apex or this game.

80
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,680
Don't worry, no, I will not drag you to hell.

81
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,320
Yeah, so I was like, alright, so we have...

82
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,200
I gave her like a list of games.

83
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,080
I was like, there's a Roblox doors.

84
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,300
Look at you, look at you!

85
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,740
What do you mean as a two-year-old?

86
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,720
Look at you!

87
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,020
You have a fucking rubber ducky floaty!

88
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,140
No!

89
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,320
That was your choice!

90
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,000
What do you mean?

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,140
Listen, you're telling me, you're telling me, you would not pick a rubber ducky floaty.

92
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,080
That's freaking lit!

93
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,260
Like, this is awesome!

94
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,420
We have the same theme!

95
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,800
You see a rubber ducky floaty right now?

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,080
Oh, wait, I forgot I can grab you.

97
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,160
This is awesome, dude.

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,980
You know, I was like, Chewie, you know you could like...

99
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,540
I shouldn't have taught you how to move ourselves.

100
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,360
Oh my god, Doki, stop!

101
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:36,780
Stop!

102
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,320
What are you doing?

103
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:37,920
Stop it!

104
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,460
Now you have too much power.

105
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,880
I know.

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
I'll give the people what they want.

107
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,600
What are you giving?

108
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,240
What are you giving?

109
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,060
We're just in a lot of toes.

110
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,740
Rent is new Doki at the last.

111
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,580
Rent is new Doki at the last.

112
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,080
Yeah, that's why she started collabing with YouTubers again.

113
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,780
The 40-year-old men weren't doing it for her.

114
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,080
So she had to come back crawling.

115
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, I hope.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,380
I know.

117
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,120
To what's worth coming, dude.

118
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,720
Oh my gosh.

119
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,880
You're like, please welcome me back.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,420
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,100
Give me back!

122
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,140
Please!

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,500
Alright, let me set up the Roblox doors game real quick.

124
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,160
I've never beaten doors, have you?

125
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,540
Never beaten doors?

126
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,340
Wait, have you not done chapter one at least?

127
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,500
I've never beaten it, no.

128
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,780
Not even chapter one?

129
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,880
Well, the thing is, like, it's really, really sad because I streamed doors with my best friend Nags.

130
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,240
Yeah.

131
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,400
And then we, like, got to room 90 and died.

132
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,420
And I was like, I can beat this.

133
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,460
So I played it off stream, like, five times and lost every single time.

134
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,560
Alright, but did you pay to win?

135
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,300
Oh my god, wait, hello?

136
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:43,900
Hello?

137
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,720
Oh, sorry, I think you got taken for a second.

138
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,180
Oh, what?

139
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,860
They got you.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,680
They got me.

141
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,660
They're like, she knows too much.

142
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,500
She taught Chibi how to, how to use VTube Studios.

143
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,060
I have so much power.

144
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,500
Dude, I'm gonna collab with so many VTubers now.

145
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Just for the fact that I can grab them and, like, ragdoll them.

146
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,240
You're just like, I didn't want to screen share, so I said no.

147
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,940
Although, now I can, like, grab my waifus and throw them at the wall.

148
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,400
It's awesome.

149
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,900
That was my breaking point screen sharing.

150
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,920
Dude, I feel so smart.

151
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,100
Like, this is so cool.

152
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,160
Whoa.

153
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,920
This is so awesome, dude.

154
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,020
Alright, we're going to the beach now.

155
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,240
Oh, we should have played a beach game.

156
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,160
A beach game?

157
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,260
Oh, like, yeah.

158
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,500
Alright, let me...

159
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:31,760
Go fishing.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,660
Go fishing.

161
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,320
That's not the beach.

162
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
I've been fishing at the beach.

163
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,140
You've been fishing at the beach?

164
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,760
Yeah.

165
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,940
Did he let you do that?

166
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,540
Wait, no, actually, that's a lie.

167
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:41,960
Is that illegal?

168
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,700
Yeah, I was going to say, isn't that illegal?

169
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,900
Yeah, I was going to say, isn't that illegal?

170
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,020
Yeah, I'm not going to lie for attention.

171
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,380
I caught a catfish.

172
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,720
Oh, shit.

173
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,520
Yeah.

174
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Did you eat it?

175
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,960
No, I actually chucked it back in.

176
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,360
You chucked it?

177
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,740
Oh, my God.

178
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,360
So, you basically tortured the fish by bringing it out of...

179
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,120
I gave it a cannon event for it to, like, you know, like, help his family.

180
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,740
You're like, I'm going to, you're like, change the trajectory of his life forever.

181
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,660
You killed his friends.

182
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,740
When I see a happy couple, I walk up through them and start ripping my eyes out.

183
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,160
You catch him and then killed, like, a bunch of his friends in front of him and then let him back into the ocean.

184
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,140
No one will believe you.

185
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,840
Your life won't change forever.

186
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:19,740
Alright.

187
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,080
Oh, my God.

188
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,740
How the fuck...

189
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,160
Where do you...

190
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,640
Doors.

191
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,720
Where the fuck is this game?

192
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,040
I don't want to add people.

193
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,600
Add friends.

194
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,340
Oh, God.

195
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,060
Uh, no, I already got...

196
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,820
I already added you.

197
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,020
Is your name DokiBird69?

198
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,720
No!

199
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,040
That's not me!

200
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,100
I did not!

201
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,960
What the fuck is that?

202
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,640
That is not me.

203
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,180
Their name is DokiBird69.

204
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,100
They didn't just add all the Doki's.

205
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,200
Like, you don't know...

206
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,480
Wait, are you Doki...

207
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,740
Are you DokiFPS?

208
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,520
Do you keep your wife?

209
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,720
That's me.

210
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:48,880
That's me.

211
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,860
You like my face?

212
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,640
I like how your avatar is just you.

213
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,760
Dude, look at my...

214
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,640
Look at my avatar.

215
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,100
You're...

216
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,120
Are you giving back shots?

217
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,720
The frickin'...

218
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,220
What's your name?

219
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,840
You're talking to take it?

220
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,700
Yeah, you're...

221
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,360
Dude, what the frick?

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,660
You're the caboose if you know what I'm saying.

223
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,400
Oh, yeah.

224
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,300
I'm here to give all...

225
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,460
Give all the trains some back shots.

226
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,420
There's people that are into that.

227
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,680
They just wanna fuck trains.

228
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,720
And...

229
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,020
Dragons wanna do cars.

230
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:14,640
Yeah.

231
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:14,940
What?

232
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,920
Have you seen that subreddit?

233
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,320
Oh!

234
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,340
Wait!

235
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,760
What?

236
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,280
I'm one of the founding fathers.

237
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
There's like a subreddit about dragons humping cars.

238
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,180
And that's some people's thing.

239
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,640
And I'm like...

240
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,660
Oh, there's a thing about where like...

241
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,180
There's like transformation where they...

242
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,540
People transforms into planes.

243
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,580
Have you seen that?

244
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,240
No, but I've seen one where they animorph into a diaper and then cry.

245
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,560
Okay, but like...

246
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,300
That's like...

247
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,400
That's like...

248
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,140
What?

249
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:39,840
That's common?

250
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,760
There's like people who are like...

251
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,430
Just obsessed with...

252
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,520
Um...

253
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,620
Just obsessed with like...

254
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,340
Diapers in general.

255
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,500
Are you speaking from experience?

256
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,820
No, I just...

257
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,220
I've been on the internet for too long.

258
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,320
Wait, Astrid...

259
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,820
Wait, look at this.

260
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,600
Show this to your stream.

261
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,620
Cause I can't do it on YouTube.

262
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,220
I...

263
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,160
Oh my...

264
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,120
Dude!

265
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,360
It's gaping!

266
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,880
Guys, I can't show this on YouTube.

267
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,360
Oh, I'll take a 3...

268
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,260
I'll take a 3D band.

269
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,040
Wait, can you see this one on YouTube studio?

270
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,260
No, no, no.

271
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:11,860
Okay, cool.

272
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,940
Okay, cool.

273
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,440
Okay, cool.

274
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,920
No, wait, I can!

275
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,560
Wait, I can!

276
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,740
It like popped up!

277
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,580
It like popped up!

278
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,400
It like popped up!

279
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,980
It's okay.

280
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,880
It's okay.

281
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,240
It's okay.

282
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,700
It was only there for 0.1 second.

283
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,240
I'm okay.

284
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,460
It's like the 5 second rule.

285
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,160
Listen.

286
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,960
There's nothing inherently sexual about this.

287
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,780
If you get a fan...

288
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:35,800
Yeah.

289
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,540
That's the reporter self-reporting.

290
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,080
They got hard.

291
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,700
So like that's...

292
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,560
That's their problem.

293
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,240
It's the moderators being like...

294
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,720
It's them.

295
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,140
Look how my sound guy was like, Okay, let's bring down Chimidoki just a little bit.

296
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,200
You have a sound guy.

297
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,580
I have a sound guy.

298
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,560
I was telling my chat that like I'm...

299
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,900
Like you are so professional.

300
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,560
And I'm like a freaking straight cat.

301
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,960
I was like, Dude!

302
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,640
Dude, I don't even know what the freaking collab room is!

303
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,340
I'm a sound guy!

304
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,280
Okay, yeah.

305
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,160
Do you have a boom mic?

306
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,560
Oh god, no.

307
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,820
I do have...

308
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,200
My mic is a thousand dollars.

309
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,380
I know.

310
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,660
Don't worry, Chibi.

311
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,200
I can tell.

312
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,100
Don't worry.

313
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,260
At that point, it's your brand.

314
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:21,720
You know?

315
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,740
It's your...

316
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,600
That's your...

317
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,460
It's my thing!

318
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,960
It's your thing, you know?

319
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,080
It's my thing!

320
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,580
Yeah!

321
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,320
Definitely!

322
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,220
Definitely!

323
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:29,580
Definitely!

324
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,140
Look, people enjoy when you peak your mic, you know?

325
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,660
Like, if you get a thousand dollar mic, you can't do that anymore.

326
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,460
Actually, no.

327
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:37,840
You can.

328
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,600
You can.

329
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,220
It like picks it up even better.

330
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,300
Okay.

331
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,420
Well, the worst thing is, like, three years ago, I bought a really expensive microphone.

332
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,840
And it's still in the box.

333
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,380
What?

334
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,160
Because...

335
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,400
Because...

336
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,940
Okay, the reason why is because this one...

337
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,640
This mic is a USB microphone, and I thought all microphones were USB.

338
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,060
Uh-huh.

339
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,380
This one has a different, like, doohickey at the end, but I don't know what...

340
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,420
Yeah, like an actual microphone.

341
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
I don't know what it is, so I never used it.

342
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,380
It's like...

343
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,360
Okay, wait, do you have a mixer?

344
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:02,840
What?

345
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,780
What?

346
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,460
Wait, wait, I'm curious.

347
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,180
How long...

348
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,700
How long have you been streaming, Chibi?

349
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,200
Wait...

350
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,040
Wait...

351
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,660
You're saving money.

352
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,340
That's good.

353
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,300
You're saving...

354
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,380
You're saving money, Chibi.

355
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:25,840
Don't...

356
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,260
Don't worry.

357
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,220
You're just a little kid.

358
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,260
You're just a little guy.

359
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,920
You're...

360
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,380
Stop!

361
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,220
It's like...

362
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,000
You give, like, your chat the...

363
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,280
I can take care of her experience, you know?

364
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,280
That's...

365
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,120
Well...

366
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,140
I don't know...

367
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,200
I don't know about that.

368
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't know, dude.

369
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,660
I like...

370
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,520
Dude, my audience, bro, they're worse than me.

371
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,080
Like, you don't even know.

372
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,620
Oh, so...

373
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,520
They're basically at...

374
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,760
They've, like, agreed that they can't fix you anymore.

375
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,020
I...

376
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,540
So they're like, I can't fix her.

377
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:52,800
But...

378
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,360
Listen...

379
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,380
People like bad girls, and I'm bad at everything.

380
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,960
I don't think that...

381
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,520
I don't...

382
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,800
I don't think you know what that means.

383
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,520
I...

384
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,720
What?

385
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,360
I...

386
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,460
I...

387
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,680
I don't think...

388
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,260
Man, I ulted.

389
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,120
I thought that was, like, a really good thing to say.

390
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,360
I don't think...

391
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,320
I don't think...

392
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,900
I think...

393
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,400
Eat a pencil.

394
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,340
It's like those things parents tell you, where you're like...

395
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,060
Uh...

396
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,220
Where you're like, don't worry, your dog went to a farm downstate.

397
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,440
And...

398
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,120
What?

399
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,800
Wait...

400
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,360
I actually had a family dog.

401
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:25,940
Go...

402
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,000
Dude...

403
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,600
Oh...

404
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,560
Don't worry, he's still there.

405
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,020
He's living his best life at that farm, you know?

406
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,640
Really?

407
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,320
Okay.

408
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,100
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,140
He's, like...

410
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,600
He's, like, playing with all the squirrels he wants to play with at that farm.

411
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,560
Oh my god!

412
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:40,600
Yeah!

413
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,520
That's so awesome!

414
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,560
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,820
It's been, like, how many years?

416
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,120
20 years since he's been in that farm?

417
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:46,740
Yeah!

418
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,100
Don't worry.

419
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,960
He's still...

420
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,260
Yeah, dogs can live, like, 40 years.

421
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,360
I don't know if you know that.

422
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,500
Jesus!

423
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,580
He should run for Senate.

424
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:52,860
Yeah!

425
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,780
I should go...

426
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,960
I should be a lawyer.

427
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,240
No!

428
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,720
No!

429
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,840
Alright, wait.

430
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,840
Did you add me yet?

431
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,060
Wait, I think I did.

432
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,860
Okay, just join my lobby.

433
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,080
Add friends.

434
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,780
Did I add you?

435
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,720
Yes, I did.

436
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,700
I'll also add DokiBird69.

437
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,140
Yeah, just add him for two.

438
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,800
Maybe he can join us.

439
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,120
Maybe we can beat doors with DokiBird69.

440
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,660
He could carry us.

441
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,020
Yeah!

442
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,780
Alright.

443
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,980
Do you see...

444
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,020
Game Capture?

445
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,700
Do you see...

446
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,120
Alright, I should Game Capture, too.

447
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,260
Alright, Sound Guy.

448
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,060
Let me know if the game volume's okay.

449
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,480
This is also why I was Sound Guy, too.

450
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,260
I love that their name is just Sound Guy.

451
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:30,840
Yeah!

452
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,240
What?

453
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,420
Sound Guy.

454
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,280
That's so freaking funny.

455
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,160
Alright.

456
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:36,700
Boom.

457
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,300
Alright, I'm almost ready.

458
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,300
Sorry, it's my first day.

459
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,800
Yeah, first day of the...

460
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,460
Year four.

461
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,080
Oh, I get the grab Doki.

462
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,200
Get in the frickin'.

463
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,640
Yeah!

464
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,300
Oh, I forgot.

465
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,760
Roblox, you have to do, like...

466
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,700
Window Capture.

467
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,140
Yeah, yeah.

468
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,820
I forgot, too.

469
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,460
Yeah, I was like, where the fuck are you?

470
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,200
Okay, they...

471
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,860
Wait, where are you?

472
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,760
Oh, they're...

473
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,240
I have scoliosis!

474
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,460
I have scoliosis!

475
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,220
What the frick?

476
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,800
You ate the list from the frickin'.

477
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,600
Look at her.

478
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,580
She has scoliosis.

479
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,260
It's in condition!

480
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,320
It's in condition!

481
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,180
Look at her.

482
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,080
Look at her.

483
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,420
Look at her.

484
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Look at her.

485
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
She has scurriosis.

486
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,240
Look at that.

487
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,620
Dude, your balls deep in fr... What's his name?

488
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,560
What's his name?

489
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,080
What's his name?

490
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,760
The tank guy?

491
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Thomas the Tank Engine.

492
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,180
You should know him.

493
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,400
That's like a show geared towards your age group.

494
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,960
Okay, how old are you?

495
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,220
Grandma!

496
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,040
Grandma!

497
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,100
Yeah?

498
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,160
I don't have to be older than you.

499
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,020
I just gotta be taller.

500
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,180
I think you're like 32.

501
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,480
Bro, what?

502
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,140
I bet you're like 36.

503
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,980
This is the girl that hangs out with 40 year olds.

504
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,680
They're my babysitters!

505
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,560
My mom pays them to be my friend.

506
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,780
Aww, that's okay.

507
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,180
She paid me too.

508
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,660
Let's get into this room.

509
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,700
Come on, child.

510
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,840
Let's get in here.

511
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,480
Hey!

512
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,140
Let me out!

513
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,440
Let me out!

514
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,220
Let me out!

515
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,620
Let's go.

516
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,700
Did you have that like dilemma when you first started streaming that you thought like your parents like paid bots to watch you?

517
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,200
Oh, yeah.

518
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,720
I did at first.

519
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,620
I did at first, yeah.

520
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,640
Alright, I don't need any of this.

521
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm not spending my Robux yet.

522
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,740
Oh my god!

523
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,420
Oh my god!

524
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,320
You hit puberty!

525
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,180
Holy shit!

526
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,020
Hey, what's up?

527
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,220
Whoa!

528
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,280
Do I stop Thomas?

529
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,300
Oh, I don't have Thomas anymore.

530
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:33,600
Wait, dude.

531
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,620
We were Eiffel... nevermind.

532
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,420
No, we were Eiffel Tower, Thomas.

533
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,680
Do you want... Okay, you can have his...

534
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,280
Oh my god, he's got a hole in the back!

535
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,460
His face is... I don't want...

536
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,920
He's got a hole in the back!

537
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,060
Okay, let me... Okay, Sound Guy said, Before she starts screaming, let's turn her down a little bit!

538
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,520
Hi, Sound Guy!

539
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,600
Oh my god.

540
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,320
Oh my god.

541
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,580
Whoa, what is... Wait, is that actually part of your... your outfit?

542
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,360
What are you looking at?

543
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:04,880
What are you looking at?

544
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,860
What are you doing?

545
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,220
I'm looking at the... the heart... the heart hole next to your crouch.

546
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,740
What the... what... what are you looking at?

547
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,520
Oh god, I'm getting insecure.

548
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,280
It's literally... it's literally positioned in your crouch area.

549
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,720
Listen, what does this do?

550
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,240
We gotta get the key.

551
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,620
Yeah, yeah, okay.

552
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,960
Wait, I need to change the settings for this.

553
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,400
Alright, where is the...

554
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,520
I don't like the...

555
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,100
Are you... are you Eiffel Towering Thomas right now?

556
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
You... you want... you really want his face?

557
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,240
Actually, no, I feel like he's a biter.

558
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,080
He looks like a biter.

559
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,760
Okay.

560
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,200
Okay.

561
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,960
Dude, his bump is so big.

562
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:46,700
Yeah?

563
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,560
Whoa, let's back it up.

564
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Open the fucking door, child.

565
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,860
Okay, okay.

566
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,820
Alright, let's go.

567
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:55,680
Alright.

568
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,220
Oh, look at all the closets.

569
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,200
Alright, let's go.

570
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,060
We can't go in the closet yet.

571
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,260
We're only at room three.

572
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,080
Oh.

573
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,040
Alright.

574
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,280
Three?

575
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,400
Okay, oh yeah, I forgot you can open these.

576
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,580
Oh, there's money.

577
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,340
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,600
We can actually buy stuff.

579
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,680
I forgot how to play this game, by the way.

580
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,180
Do you... do you remember how...

581
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,960
When was the last time you played doors?

582
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,720
What was that?

583
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,060
You bitch.

584
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,600
It's like I messed up.

585
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,420
God, I see your donkey before I see you.

586
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:33,980
Oh, it was rain.

587
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,060
Oh, it was rain.

588
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,700
Okay, nice.

589
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,360
I got the money.

590
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,500
Alright, so when was the last time you played doors, GB?

591
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,580
Uh...

592
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,500
Maybe like...

593
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,860
Uh...

594
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,240
Couple months ago, I think.

595
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,880
Okay, that's good.

596
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,100
So we were both going in with zero knowledge.

597
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,480
Yeah.

598
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,820
I played...

599
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,340
There's like...

600
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,940
There's like...

601
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,280
Twitch crowd control.

602
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:52,900
Uh...

603
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,620
Wait, for Roblox?

604
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,480
For doors?

605
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,300
Yeah, for doors.

606
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:56,960
Yeah, yeah.

607
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,780
How do they control it?

608
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,700
They type in chat and they vote what happens to you.

609
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,860
And uh...

610
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,440
It's really bad.

611
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,300
Yeah, you're never beating this game.

612
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,480
I was gonna say, you're never beating this game.

613
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,060
They pelt you with tomatoes.

614
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,960
It's bad.

615
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,660
It's really bad.

616
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,500
Don't worry, I believe.

617
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:13,960
Oh!

618
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,200
Wait, I heard you got something.

619
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,040
What is that?

620
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,640
I found a battery.

621
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,780
I'mma lick it.

622
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,860
I don't know what that does.

623
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,520
Have you ever actually licked a battery before?

624
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,740
No, but when I was a kid and often times an adult, I would plug it...

625
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,600
With your iPhone charger?

626
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,120
What do you mean often times?

627
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,320
Occasionally, I would...

628
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,760
You plug in your iPhone charger and you know like the little part you put in the phone, I'd lick it and it'd be spicy.

629
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,840
It's like a little sour and it like zaps you a little.

630
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,060
Yeah, and you'll never have to grow up after that.

631
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,820
Mentally, you'll always be there.

632
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,000
And life got good after that.

633
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,860
I found a key.

634
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,340
Oh nice, that's what we need.

635
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,840
Don't worry, I have money.

636
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,700
I also, as a kid, had a salt lamp, which was like a brick of like salt.

637
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,200
Oh.

638
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,500
And I would bite off chunks and eat it like religiously.

639
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,060
And I found out 20 years later, they got recalled because they cause brain damage when consumed by it.

640
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,600
I was not even getting there.

641
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,540
Wait.

642
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,860
Why did no one stop you?

643
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:16,460
Why?

644
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,900
Dude, I would bite off chunks and give it to my little sister too.

645
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,800
Oh my god.

646
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,700
You made your little sister.

647
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,980
You have to bring her down with you.

648
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,620
I know.

649
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,820
Well listen, she went to college and made the family proud.

650
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,260
I'm playing Mobox with Doki Burst.

651
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,020
Okay, but you...

652
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,580
You...

653
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,940
Okay, but like...

654
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,780
Because she ate it once, you know?

655
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,720
You were continuous.

656
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,800
There's a camera.

657
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,440
Yeah, I got that lamp.

658
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,760
That's legendary loot.

659
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,800
Is it?

660
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,300
I don't know.

661
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,800
I was just wondering.

662
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,940
I just wanted it to be special.

663
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,240
Maybe if it ate a salt lamp, maybe it is.

664
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,320
Okay.

665
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,440
Wait, that...

666
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,160
You can't open that.

667
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,840
Yeah, I don't got a key.

668
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Alright.

669
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,420
Number 10.

670
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,040
Yeah, I didn't buy us a key.

671
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,660
I wanted to save money.

672
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,040
Cause I don't think we're...

673
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,380
That's okay.

674
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,320
Don't look at it.

675
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,860
Don't look at it.

676
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,460
Okay.

677
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,100
I remember.

678
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,680
I remember.

679
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,200
She's Doki Burding.

680
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,860
I'm Doki Burding right now.

681
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,740
Sorry, I dropped out of college.

682
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,420
Don't scare me.

683
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,000
Jesus, that was loud.

684
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,200
It's why you didn't go to college, right?

685
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,520
No, I did.

686
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,180
I did.

687
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,060
For a time.

688
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,040
And then I made 10 bucks off of Twitch.

689
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,060
And I was like, you know what?

690
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,880
I don't make 10 bucks off of college.

691
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,980
Dude, and also the first thing I did when I got monetized was...

692
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,920
Don't go in that room.

693
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,500
Don't go in that room.

694
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,120
That's a bad room.

695
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,320
That's a bad room.

696
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,940
I turn around and you're a smear on the floor.

697
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,520
Do you remember what number we were at?

698
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:49,840
Oh!

699
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:49,920
Oh!

700
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:50,640
Yes!

701
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,000
Yes!

702
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,760
This one!

703
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,020
Look!

704
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,100
See?

705
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,260
I definitely knew that.

706
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,040
Yeah!

707
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,100
Thomas is sticking out!

708
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,960
Thomas the Tank Engine just scares at me.

709
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,100
His eyes are so lifeless like he was not sculpted by a creator.

710
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,360
He's seen...

711
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,780
He's seen some things.

712
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,940
You know like Roblox creators can make like...

713
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,000
Sorry.

714
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,120
There's a spider crawling around.

715
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,600
You know like...

716
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,420
Roblox creators, they can...

717
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,160
They make like six figures off of Roblox content.

718
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,360
What?

719
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,560
Yeah, I know.

720
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,040
We chose the wrong career.

721
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,000
What the frick?

722
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,800
Are you kidding me?

723
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,220
Yeah, no, I had a guy...

724
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,480
Came to me at a meet and greet at off guy.

725
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,600
And he was like, hey, like I make Roblox content.

726
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,020
I was like, oh cool.

727
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,820
How much do you make?

728
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,540
And he's like, six figures.

729
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,160
That's actually insane.

730
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,880
And they should be proud of that.

731
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,920
Cause like dude, stupid kids spend their Roblox.

732
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,900
Yeah, I'm gonna be spending Roblox soon.

733
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,920
Okay, it's this door.

734
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,020
It's number 18.

735
00:23:59,740 --> 00:23:59,980
Yeah.

736
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,340
Yeah, apparently the best paying 3D job you can do as a 3D content...

737
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,680
Like a 3D maker is to make models for Roblox.

738
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,820
Wow.

739
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:10,540
Yeah.

740
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,080
Wait, that's actually crazy.

741
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,080
Cause I mean, somebody made a chibi dokey model in Roblox and look at you.

742
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,760
You bought it.

743
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,760
I did.

744
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,580
I spent 3 Roblox on this.

745
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,000
I did.

746
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,620
Look at you.

747
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,960
You got Thomas the Tank Engine right here.

748
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,340
I got Thomas the Tank Engine.

749
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,980
He's like a parasite.

750
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,480
He's just like attached to you.

751
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

752
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,660
He just started it.

753
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,210
I'll be like...

754
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,780
Choo-choo, chibi.

755
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,320
Choo-choo.

756
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,340
Choo-choo.

757
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,040
Hey, come on.

758
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,660
Again!

759
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,880
Okay, I'm never opening doors.

760
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,960
You're a freaking victim.

761
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,100
I'm a victim.

762
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,420
Is your health okay?

763
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,740
Sure.

764
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,440
We're fine.

765
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,220
We're so fine.

766
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:52,680
Okay.

767
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,160
Oh.

768
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,240
Oh.

769
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,080
It's a big room.

770
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,800
Oh my gosh.

771
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,680
Look at all the money.

772
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,380
Hopefully we can find a band-aid for you keys.

773
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,220
Yeah.

774
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,260
Just put a...

775
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,120
Put a band-aid over my open gaping flesh wound.

776
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:09,860
Whoa.

777
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,900
Everything will be okay, right?

778
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,000
It's like when people...

779
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
Like when you get...

780
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,440
Oh.

781
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,180
Can I ask a question?

782
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,660
Yeah.

783
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,180
What is your bird noise?

784
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,480
Because you know some birds go...

785
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,860
And some scream.

786
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,560
Yeah.

787
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,000
What is your bird noise?

788
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,160
My bird noise?

789
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,620
Oh, I can do a really good crow.

790
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:40,920
Yeah?

791
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

792
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,560
Watch this.

793
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,660
Wait, I can't...

794
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,760
How do I light my candle?

795
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,960
How do I light my candle?

796
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,940
Okay, I guess we'll be in the dark.

797
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
That's how you say candle.

798
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,700
You go candle.

799
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,060
Cando.

800
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,280
Cando.

801
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,500
Oh my god.

802
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,300
How do we get a...

803
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:56,920
Okay, wait.

804
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,480
Wait, what's your best bird noise?

805
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,440
Wait, how did you light your candle?

806
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,200
This is...

807
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,460
This is not a candle, my dear.

808
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:03,740
Wait, wait.

809
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,540
Can you light my candle?

810
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,720
Oh, yeah.

811
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,420
I'll light your candle.

812
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:06,820
Yeah?

813
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,000
I've never made it this far.

814
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,280
I'm a throw.

815
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,620
Okay.

816
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:09,700
Okay.

817
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,820
Watch this.

818
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,380
Wait, watch out.

819
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,640
Watch out.

820
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,760
Okay, I think there's a bird in your room.

821
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,140
I think a crow just attacked her.

822
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,260
Oh my god, are you okay?

823
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,000
It's like a crow getting pelted.

824
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,900
Yeah, yeah.

825
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,700
Before he fucking stabs you.

826
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,570
Like, yours is like so majestic.

827
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,410
And I'm like...

828
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,010
Thank you, dude.

829
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,610
I'm known for being...

830
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,550
Oh, wait.

831
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,150
There's another key.

832
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,250
Oh, we gotta find another key.

833
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,210
Key time.

834
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,770
Oh, I found it.

835
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,170
I found it.

836
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:47,690
Oh, nice.

837
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,630
Yeah, it was right on the desk.

838
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,310
It's like just there.

839
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:51,910
Sitting there.

840
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,030
Okay, if I die first, you're gonna have to clutch this.

841
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:57,530
Wait.

842
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,810
If you die...

843
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,630
No.

844
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,890
You're gonna have to clutch this.

845
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,690
If you die first, I'm dying too.

846
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,090
Alright, you gotta live on for the family legacy.

847
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,990
The bloodline doesn't stop with you.

848
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,050
My bloodline went sideways.

849
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,720
You are disgusting.

850
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,420
Look, I seriously think...

851
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,160
You know, like, the goblin mask?

852
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,500
Yeah.

853
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,180
Like, I seriously think that's Thomas.

854
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,560
He's just taking over you.

855
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,220
He's turning you into a monster.

856
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,320
Wait, what's...

857
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,920
Where's the door?

858
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,340
I don't know.

859
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,980
Is there a door?

860
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,780
I don't think that was...

861
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:35,940
Yeah.

862
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,100
I don't think that was the...

863
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,140
Yeah.

864
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,380
No, it wasn't.

865
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,540
Look.

866
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,760
It's blurred out.

867
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,340
Okay, down here?

868
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,880
Where's this where we came from?

869
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,300
Yeah, down here, down here.

870
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

871
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,620
There it is.

872
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,660
Oh, Jesus!

873
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,280
The Thomas emerging from the darkness.

874
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,640
It's so creepy creepy.

875
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:48,960
It's like...

876
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,260
Choo-choo cheesy.

877
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,040
Choo-choo.

878
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,040
What?

879
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,220
It's the same...

880
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,300
I'm scared.

881
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,780
Someone needs to like...

882
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,260
This is a safety concern.

883
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,740
I swear to God, if the spider comes out in one of these drawers, I swear to God.

884
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,380
Oh, a lockpick!

885
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:05,860
You want a lockpick?

886
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,100
Oh, wait, wait.

887
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,180
No, you should have it.

888
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,300
Yeah?

889
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,100
I think you're gonna live on and continue the bloodline.

890
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,520
I don't feel so good right now.

891
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,120
Oh, frick.

892
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,320
We need to get to an anvil.

893
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,420
Maybe there's like a 7-Eleven...

894
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,660
Oh, frick.

895
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,160
Oh, what was that sound?

896
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,200
Oh, oh, oh!

897
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,300
There's a spider somewhere!

898
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,640
Oh.

899
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,880
I think it's on you.

900
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,340
Psst.

901
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,340
Okay, there's like 17 spiders on us.

902
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,040
I'm not even kidding.

903
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,820
Do you feel them?

904
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,720
Sure, they are.

905
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,180
Wait, I think you need to turn on the light.

906
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,620
I'm not lying!

907
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,720
Wait, hold on, let me move.

908
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,400
Dude, if you saw my wire management right now, I think you would have like...

909
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,940
Are you okay?

910
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,280
Are you okay?

911
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,400
Alright.

912
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,360
I don't know.

913
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,240
I feel spiders crawling inside of me.

914
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,560
I can't deserve that.

915
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,000
What?

916
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,100
I deserve that.

917
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,080
Oh.

918
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,600
Oh, I see the eyes.

919
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,620
They're looking at you.

920
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,180
Oh, hey guys.

921
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:02,780
Oh.

922
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,040
They're fans.

923
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,160
It was on Dolky Bird?

924
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:05,840
Oh my god.

925
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,320
Wait, what do you call your fans?

926
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,240
Idiots.

927
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,780
Wait, is that your fan community name?

928
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,640
Well, it really depends on the day, because sometimes it'll be incels, sometimes it'll be disappointment.

929
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,180
It really depends on the vibe we have going on.

930
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,600
Cause listen, the words they call me are so unacceptable.

931
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:24,980
Like what?

932
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,540
They call me...

933
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,220
They call me...

934
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,600
They call me cocky strokey.

935
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,740
It's actually disgusting.

936
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,020
It's disgusting.

937
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,240
Wait, where did that come from?

938
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,800
There had to be a story though.

939
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,280
There's not.

940
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,020
They literally...

941
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,260
No, no.

942
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,240
There is a story.

943
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,260
You're not telling me.

944
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,180
There is a story.

945
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,900
It doesn't just come out of nowhere.

946
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:42,980
I...

947
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,600
Something happened.

948
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,220
Do you recall that?

949
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,000
They like to call me names that pissed me off.

950
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,300
And that one just happened and it really, it really did.

951
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,240
Oh, so did you like get one guide and then...

952
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,640
One guide said...

953
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:57,700
I don't know.

954
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,620
Let's move on.

955
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,500
What's your favorite color?

956
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,200
Did you get one guide and now it's there forever?

957
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,800
Let's move on.

958
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
What's your favorite color?

959
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,360
Oh, that's a lot of eyes.

960
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,880
Oh, I got lockpick.

961
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,940
Wait, I got beer too.

962
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,720
You got beer?

963
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,460
Yeah, I got beer.

964
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,720
Want some, little child?

965
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,220
Oh, yeah.

966
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,520
I'll have some.

967
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,760
Dude, you drank it.

968
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,680
It was so loud.

969
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,560
Oh my god.

970
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,180
There is...

971
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,560
There is reduced motion.

972
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,280
If you press tab.

973
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,460
Thank god.

974
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,180
Reduced...

975
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,560
Oh!

976
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,620
Yeah, thank god.

977
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,220
That shit was bothering me so much.

978
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,440
I believe in us.

979
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,820
You think we'll beat this game?

980
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,720
I think...

981
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,040
As long as something scary happens.

982
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,380
Oh.

983
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,020
I think...

984
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,860
Wait, what room is this?

985
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,800
We haven't seen a monster in a while.

986
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,440
Oh, that's true.

987
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,320
We haven't seen...

988
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,800
Okay.

989
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,520
Oh no!

990
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,140
He's listening!

991
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,180
Wait, wait.

992
00:30:59,500 --> 00:30:59,900
Okay.

993
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,480
Okay.

994
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,740
I don't do well in these.

995
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,480
I don't...

996
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,700
I need you to know I have died to this level.

997
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,680
Many times.

998
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:06,960
Take my hand!

999
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,920
Can you hold on to my Thomas?

1000
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,400
Go left!

1001
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,840
It's left!

1002
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,600
Okay, I'm on left.

1003
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:12,980
I'm...

1004
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,500
The music is so lit.

1005
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:14,780
Okay.

1006
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,360
Okay, it's straight!

1007
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,100
Oh, it's straight?

1008
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,620
Sorry, Pride Month.

1009
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:19,700
God.

1010
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,880
Pride Month's over.

1011
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,260
It's okay.

1012
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,200
Oh!

1013
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,560
God, they're trying to dab me up!

1014
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,080
Oh!

1015
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,740
Did you make it?

1016
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,400
I made it.

1017
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,800
I made it.

1018
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,160
I'm okay.

1019
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm okay.

1020
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,040
Don't worry.

1021
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,860
The adult is here.

1022
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,200
The adult is here.

1023
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,440
Thank God.

1024
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,360
I need Thomas, dude.

1025
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,540
I need him.

1026
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,540
I need him.

1027
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,140
He's my emotional support.

1028
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,760
You know the best part?

1029
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,480
Is that my Thomas is sticking out of me.

1030
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,000
Wait.

1031
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,860
When you look down, it looks like you're kissing his head.

1032
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,780
He's a good boy.

1033
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,020
It's like you're whispering in his ear.

1034
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,020
So fucking creepy.

1035
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,720
Okay, there's a chest here.

1036
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,840
He looks like he's sculpted out of mashed potatoes.

1037
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,980
He's so freaking creepy and lifeless.

1038
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,220
You know they rebooted Thomas the Tank Engine?

1039
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,420
Really?

1040
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,240
They made him a child.

1041
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,600
They made him a child.

1042
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,220
Wait, wait.

1043
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,280
Listen, hear me out.

1044
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:11,680
Yeah?

1045
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,740
There's two rooms in this room.

1046
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,480
Which means one of them is real and one of them is fake.

1047
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,400
This is your redemption.

1048
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,720
You can figure out.

1049
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,240
Okay.

1050
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,480
No, it's okay.

1051
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,940
You want me to go?

1052
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,440
I believe in you.

1053
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,220
I believe in Chibi.

1054
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:23,960
This is your time.

1055
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,200
Yeah.

1056
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,820
I did it.

1057
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,460
What?

1058
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,000
Dude, I should do it.

1059
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,400
I should go to Vegas.

1060
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,820
Are you okay?

1061
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,280
Do you live?

1062
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,200
Yeah, you live.

1063
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,440
If I have fingers, I'd be doing the choice freaking gesture right now.

1064
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,540
I can tell like you don't pay attention to the lights.

1065
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,560
Don't look.

1066
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,220
Don't look.

1067
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,480
Don't look.

1068
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:01,600
Don't look.

1069
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,860
Everything bad is happening to me right now.

1070
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,460
Oh, don't look.

1071
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:06,860
What?

1072
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,640
Where's this?

1073
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,720
Where's this?

1074
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:08,860
Where's this go?

1075
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,280
I don't know.

1076
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,840
I think we gotta find the lever maybe?

1077
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,900
Oh, is this the lever again?

1078
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh, there's Jorzo.

1079
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,880
Okay, if that guy...

1080
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,820
Did you say there's Jordans?

1081
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,260
No, dude.

1082
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,280
Are you Jorking it?

1083
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,700
Look, I found some juice.

1084
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,860
Oh, yeah.

1085
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,020
It's heels.

1086
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,820
Oh.

1087
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,120
I'm smelling colors now.

1088
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,520
What color are you smelling?

1089
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,600
Purple.

1090
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,800
I knew it.

1091
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,040
Wait, are we supposed to do anything now I'm here?

1092
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,520
I think we should...

1093
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:40,600
Oh!

1094
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,480
I found it, I found it.

1095
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:41,700
Oh, we found it?

1096
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,240
Where did you go?

1097
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,460
Yeah, it was in the corner.

1098
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,560
Okay, now we go back up.

1099
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,660
Alright, I'm back up already.

1100
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,860
It's so dark, it's so creepy.

1101
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,320
Oh my god!

1102
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,020
The

1103
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,880
second I saw you, I heard, psst.

1104
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,960
I thought it was you and that it was an actual spider, you motherfucker.

1105
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,340
That's disgusting.

1106
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,540
That's so messed up.

1107
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,960
You'll never know if it's me or the spider.

1108
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,070
You'll never know.

1109
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,640
It's so messed up.

1110
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,740
It can be anyone.

1111
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,540
That $1,000 mic makes it sound real.

1112
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,140
That's the only reason why I invested in $1,000 mic.

1113
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,640
It's when I went because of Doris.

1114
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,480
Yeah, so I can be the best fighter in Doris.

1115
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,260
Alright, I think this is the last...

1116
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,060
Oh, it's...

1117
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,280
Oh!

1118
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,960
It's Stranger Things time.

1119
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,360
Okay.

1120
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,840
It looks like a, like a salami stick.

1121
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,740
I might be dead.

1122
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,220
Okay.

1123
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,810
We have to get the books.

1124
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,310
I'm dead.

1125
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:51,870
I'm dead.

1126
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,630
I'm dead.

1127
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:53,230
I'm dead.

1128
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,490
No, you're not.

1129
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,170
No, you're not.

1130
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,250
No, you're not.

1131
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:57,270
No, you're not.

1132
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,050
No!

1133
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,080
We still gotta find all the sparkly books.

1134
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,400
Yeah.

1135
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,560
God, it's been a hot minute since I've been in the library.

1136
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,260
Were you taken?

1137
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,260
I'm like in the ocean right now, looking out into the sun.

1138
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,060
Okay, seven, four, okay.

1139
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,260
I believe in you.

1140
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,400
I believe in you, Chibi.

1141
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,960
My child.

1142
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,160
You got this.

1143
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,060
Thanks, dad.

1144
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,350
No?

1145
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,390
I hear a book.

1146
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,130
Oh yeah, you know Espanol.

1147
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,950
I can res you!

1148
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,790
Do I have enough money?

1149
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:45,850
Yeah!

1150
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,810
Res me!

1151
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,870
30 Robux.

1152
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,030
Don't we have PSP?

1153
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,160
Did you res me?

1154
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,430
Did you do it?

1155
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,190
I'm under the water.

1156
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,050
I'm drowning.

1157
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,470
There's your body.

1158
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,490
Did I res you?

1159
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,030
Sure.

1160
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,370
Let's just say that.

1161
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,910
Wait, I got you up!

1162
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:26,450
I did it!

1163
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,890
Yeah, you did it.

1164
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,330
I'm so proud of you.

1165
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,730
Wait, oh my god.

1166
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,250
Thomas is sticking out.

1167
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,710
He's watching the door for you.

1168
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,310
You sure did, champ.

1169
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,250
You sure did.

1170
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,610
I'm really glad because I thought I just died.

1171
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,730
No, no.

1172
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,470
You did it.

1173
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,370
You did it, buddy.

1174
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:48,690
Thomas!

1175
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,750
Okay, I know you have a res.

1176
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,870
Wait, does it cost real money?

1177
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,410
It cost Roblox.

1178
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,630
Wait, so I spent 30 Robux on you?

1179
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:05,670
Yes.

1180
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,350
Oh, quick!

1181
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,260
Okay.

1182
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
That's my dog, Princess.

1183
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,360
You don't bite.

1184
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:16,700
You're good.

1185
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,700
Alright, so...

1186
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,800
Apparently, they made it so that you can't...

1187
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,960
You can't fucking stay in...

1188
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,860
Stay in the cupboards longer anymore.

1189
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:27,940
See?

1190
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,140
Oh, no.

1191
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,280
Oh, no.

1192
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,620
Oh, no.

1193
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,440
Oh, no.

1194
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,620
Chibi, you better tip your ass back into this game.

1195
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,960
Okay, okay.

1196
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,580
I'm doing it.

1197
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,080
I'm gone.

1198
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,920
Guys, could you please donate one dollar?

1199
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,920
I need my money back.

1200
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,420
Guys, I need my money back.

1201
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,060
Are you serious?

1202
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,460
I'll distract him.

1203
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,020
I'm sprinting.

1204
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,960
It didn't work.

1205
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,160
Okay, you go find the code.

1206
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,940
I'm in the cupboards right now.

1207
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,140
Okay.

1208
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,540
I'm looking for books.

1209
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,820
I'm playing a rhythm game.

1210
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,840
Lock the frickin.

1211
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,500
Okay.

1212
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,280
I think the rest of the books are up there.

1213
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,360
Oh, my God.

1214
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,560
Oh, my God.

1215
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,380
Let me out!

1216
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,160
This is so sad.

1217
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,560
Okay, you better be finding these codes.

1218
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,920
I'm barely playing a rhythm game.

1219
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,600
I'm just gonna walk past you.

1220
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,460
I think the books are up here.

1221
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,980
Okay, did you find them all?

1222
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,200
I don't know.

1223
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,560
The salami mommy is after me.

1224
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,700
Okay, is he?

1225
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,400
Okay, thank God.

1226
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:41,760
All right.

1227
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,320
He left.

1228
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:42,680
He left.

1229
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,820
Okay, I think the books are...

1230
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,460
What's the code?

1231
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,220
You need to get the map.

1232
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,820
Oh, there's a map.

1233
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,200
Okay, there's like the...

1234
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,760
It's at the center over there.

1235
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,060
The left side.

1236
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,820
Or left.

1237
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,500
Oh, I see it.

1238
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,220
Okay, I'll go get it.

1239
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:55,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1240
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,080
You go get it and I'll be at the code area.

1241
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,540
I think you have all of them.

1242
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,540
Who's he pissed at?

1243
00:38:59,540 --> 00:38:59,860
Who's he pissed at?

1244
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,500
He's...

1245
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,140
Oh, hey, Doki.

1246
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,480
Me?

1247
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,040
I think...

1248
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,080
I don't think he likes you.

1249
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,120
I think he's a hate watcher.

1250
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,140
Oh, my gosh.

1251
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,420
Nice.

1252
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,740
Let me run an ad real quick.

1253
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,880
Any exposure is good exposure.

1254
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:15,540
Yo.

1255
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,460
Yo.

1256
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,240
That is true.

1257
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:19,960
Okay.

1258
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,160
Okay, I got the paper.

1259
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,160
It's...

1260
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,900
Okay.

1261
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,420
Give me a sec.

1262
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,740
I'm playing a rhythm game still.

1263
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,020
Come on.

1264
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,480
No.

1265
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,260
Okay.

1266
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:28,880
It's...

1267
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,380
What is it?

1268
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:29,860
Uh...

1269
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,080
Goodbye.

1270
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,160
Oh, God.

1271
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:33,980
We're missing a book.

1272
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,100
Goodbye.

1273
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,660
Goodbye.

1274
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,720
I'm gonna die.

1275
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,120
Goodbye.

1276
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,700
It's up to you.

1277
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,640
It's up to you, Chibi.

1278
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,480
It's up to you!

1279
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:46,490
Wait.

1280
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,650
He's stuck on a wall.

1281
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,470
He's stuck on a wall.

1282
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,430
He's freaking gritting.

1283
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,050
He's stuck on a wall.

1284
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,130
Oh, no.

1285
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:52,630
He got out.

1286
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,030
He got out.

1287
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,030
I'm gonna res you.

1288
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:54,650
I'm gonna res you.

1289
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,770
Oh, frick.

1290
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,590
He's pissed off.

1291
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,970
Oh, my God.

1292
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:01,450
Are you...

1293
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:01,770
Free loot.

1294
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:02,470
Oh, nice.

1295
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,650
Oh, that's awkward.

1296
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,230
What is it, Chibi?

1297
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,310
Aren't you gonna res me?

1298
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:08,970
I'm right there.

1299
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,070
I don't think your God's favorite little barrel is still rushing.

1300
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,550
What do you mean?

1301
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:14,190
I...

1302
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,370
I see a heart floating there, Chibi.

1303
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,190
I see...

1304
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:17,910
Nothing popped up.

1305
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,510
I see a heart that's floating there.

1306
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,470
What do you mean?

1307
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,470
What do you eat?

1308
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,230
It's just...

1309
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,730
It's blank!

1310
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,750
There's something...

1311
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,090
You fucking...

1312
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,330
I'll remember this.

1313
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,910
Yo, that was your loot?

1314
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,910
That free loot was yours.

1315
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,210
Oh, frick.

1316
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,110
I found your candle.

1317
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,330
Okay, okay.

1318
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,090
I think...

1319
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,950
I think I'm missing one freaking book.

1320
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,710
I'm getting one book.

1321
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,590
Okay, just force it.

1322
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,230
Just force it.

1323
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,410
Okay, brute force.

1324
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,210
Okay, it's uh...

1325
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,030
What's the code?

1326
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,370
Seven...

1327
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,330
Question mark.

1328
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,670
We know seven...

1329
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,130
Two...

1330
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:51,870
Five...

1331
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,510
Seven...

1332
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:52,950
Two...

1333
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,530
Five...

1334
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,510
One...

1335
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:54,990
Four.

1336
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,150
I don't remember.

1337
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:56,710
You gotta remember.

1338
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,450
Okay, seven...

1339
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,430
Seven...

1340
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,630
Seven...

1341
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,110
Two...

1342
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,030
Five...

1343
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,510
What is it now?

1344
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:04,830
One...

1345
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,890
I miscalculated something.

1346
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,430
Yeah, you know, you don't know one, so you gotta, like, reinforce the second one.

1347
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:19,750
So it's seven, and then whatever number you want, and then two, five, one, four.

1348
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:28,770
No, it's seven, seven, two... Because it's seven, two, five, one, four.

1349
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,450
Seven, two, five, one, four.

1350
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,310
Oh my god, I'm just gonna read your paper.

1351
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:37,090
Seven, two, one, five, four.

1352
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:44,530
Seven, two... Seven, two, five, three, four.

1353
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:50,250
Seven, six... Okay, it's seven, six, one... That's an X, not a star?

1354
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,790
Seven, six, one, three, four.

1355
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,210
Oh!

1356
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,590
Oh, I thought that was a star.

1357
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,770
Okay, I'm missing a book.

1358
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,390
How do you... What?

1359
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,070
Seven... Seven...

1360
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,310
Two, two, five, one, three.

1361
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:05,970
And then we just guessed.

1362
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,690
Pick a number.

1363
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:07,350
Three.

1364
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:09,750
Nope.

1365
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:10,190
Nope.

1366
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,630
Okay, and then you can do it again.

1367
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,350
You keep doing it.

1368
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,370
I'll keep watch.

1369
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:13,970
Okay, okay.

1370
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,010
Seven, two, one... What was it?

1371
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:22,930
Seven, two, one, five... No, it's eight, zero, zero, eights.

1372
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:23,810
Or five.

1373
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,010
Wait, really?

1374
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,530
Yeah, eight, zero, zero, eight, five.

1375
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,650
Oh, fuck!

1376
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,410
I put the phone on!

1377
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:36,570
Seven... Seven... Two... One... Five... Nine?

1378
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,630
Yeah.

1379
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,570
Don't worry, you're fine.

1380
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,350
He's not near you.

1381
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:49,640
Seven... Two... One... Five... Six.

1382
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,520
I'm gonna go find the book.

1383
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,180
I'm gonna... I think... I think it's like right over here.

1384
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,500
Trust.

1385
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:56,900
Trust.

1386
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,200
Okay.

1387
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,200
You can do it.

1388
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:57,720
No, no.

1389
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,420
Just proof force it.

1390
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,640
You can literally proof force it.

1391
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,660
You're literally one.

1392
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,820
You're in this chest.

1393
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,800
One number!

1394
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,360
Don't worry.

1395
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,080
I'm keeping watch.

1396
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:05,480
Don't worry.

1397
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:05,980
You won't die.

1398
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,880
I'm keeping watch.

1399
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:07,800
Okay.

1400
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,140
Seven.

1401
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:08,540
What is it?

1402
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:08,920
Seven?

1403
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,040
Seven, two, five, one, and then just go number... Go up by one.

1404
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,080
Okay.

1405
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,860
I'll do... Three.

1406
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,520
And then you just keep going up.

1407
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,900
Seven... Seven, two... Five, one.

1408
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,720
Don't worry, you're fine.

1409
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,860
He's not near you.

1410
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,120
Seven.

1411
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,720
Seven.

1412
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:28,940
Seven.

1413
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,580
Two.

1414
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,040
Five.

1415
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:32,520
One.

1416
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,160
Eight.

1417
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,300
I feel like I am watching a child right now.

1418
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,220
One.

1419
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,100
Six.

1420
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,280
Seven.

1421
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,400
Seven.

1422
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,380
Two.

1423
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,180
One.

1424
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,500
Five.

1425
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,740
Seven.

1426
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,680
Seven.

1427
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,120
Two.

1428
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,560
Five.

1429
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,560
One.

1430
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,380
There's only nine numbers.

1431
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,440
I don't understand.

1432
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:16,740
There's only... There's only nine numbers.

1433
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:17,880
Seven.

1434
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,660
What was the second number?

1435
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,360
Two.

1436
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,020
Five.

1437
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,520
Am I good?

1438
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,940
There's no keys.

1439
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,180
There's no keys right there.

1440
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:26,660
Am I good?

1441
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,360
Am I good?

1442
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,080
Bro, that's

1443
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,080
cute.

1444
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,880
He likes me.

1445
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,840
He likes me.

1446
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,100
Actually, I can't believe.

1447
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,540
Seven.

1448
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,460
Two.

1449
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,120
Five.

1450
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:49,960
Not

1451
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,140
you.

1452
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,440
Just go by...

1453
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,560
Oh, what do you mean?

1454
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,360
Just go up by one every time.

1455
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,560
I just do it with the heart now.

1456
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,960
I just do it with the heart now.

1457
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,340
Two.

1458
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,740
You tried two.

1459
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,460
You did two twice.

1460
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,860
You put two in there twice.

1461
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,300
I'm not gonna put two a third time, Chibi.

1462
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:15,980
I did eight.

1463
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,300
I already did eight in nine.

1464
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,000
I already did eight in nine.

1465
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,600
You did six or seven.

1466
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,720
Seven.

1467
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,080
Seven.

1468
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,740
Two.

1469
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,440
I already did nine.

1470
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,560
The monster just ignores it because he's just too strong.

1471
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:37,620
Four.

1472
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,180
Seven.

1473
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,520
She's too small.

1474
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,240
Seven.

1475
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:40,860
Two.

1476
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,420
Seven.

1477
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:42,860
Two.

1478
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,480
Seven.

1479
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:45,780
Two.

1480
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:46,120
One.

1481
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,040
What is it?

1482
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:47,300
Seven.

1483
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:47,540
Two.

1484
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:47,980
Five.

1485
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:48,500
One.

1486
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,640
Three.

1487
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,600
Try three.

1488
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:52,920
No.

1489
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,420
What do you mean no?

1490
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,280
Did you try three?

1491
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,620
I did.

1492
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,540
Okay, four.

1493
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,000
We go up by one.

1494
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,080
This is like simple numbers.

1495
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:03,960
Try four.

1496
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,960
Okay, try four.

1497
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,740
Have you ever tried the game?

1498
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,120
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

1499
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:08,940
I'm just wondering.

1500
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,500
Yeah.

1501
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,800
Did you beat the game?

1502
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:13,740
No.

1503
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,400
Which grade?

1504
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,520
Four, right?

1505
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:19,880
Four?

1506
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,120
Four, yeah.

1507
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:21,560
Four.

1508
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,700
What if we're doing the code wrong?

1509
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,780
Okay, you do...

1510
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,160
No, what?

1511
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,460
Seven.

1512
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,580
What do we need?

1513
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,640
What do we need?

1514
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,500
Count Dracula.

1515
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,360
Oh, seven, two, five, one.

1516
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,720
Yep, seven, two, five, one.

1517
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,820
Have you tried four?

1518
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,060
Have you tried four?

1519
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,240
Wait, I don't think we've tried five.

1520
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,540
Okay, trash.

1521
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,560
I swear to God.

1522
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,240
If we just went from zero to ten.

1523
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,320
Zero to nine.

1524
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:01,640
Okay, okay.

1525
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,680
Okay, now I'll do six.

1526
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,040
Okay, if we did six, didn't we?

1527
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,420
Oh.

1528
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,140
You just haven't done...

1529
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,160
Seven.

1530
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,840
Is it seven, two, five, one?

1531
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:10,620
Seven.

1532
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,060
You want to do seven?

1533
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:11,460
Yeah.

1534
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,780
Okay.

1535
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,100
There's no way it's seven.

1536
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,420
It's not seven!

1537
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,800
Seven, two, five, one, six.

1538
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:19,540
Okay, six.

1539
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,620
Apparently six.

1540
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,040
It's gotta be six.

1541
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,020
Six or one.

1542
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,220
Oh!

1543
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:24,980
Maybe it's one!

1544
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,880
Oh my God.

1545
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,660
If it was one, we could have started on the number one and this would have been over.

1546
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,340
It was one, wasn't it?

1547
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,400
It was one, wasn't it, Chibi?

1548
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,780
It was fucking one!

1549
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,260
It was one.

1550
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,260
We could have started at one.

1551
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:55,940
We could have started at one.

1552
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,660
Why did you randomly pick, like, eight?

1553
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,380
Because I had a seance!

1554
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,020
I think God was speaking to me.

1555
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,180
Or at the gas leak.

1556
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,080
I don't know why.

1557
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,260
God was speaking through her.

1558
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,360
I'm sure it wasn't, like, a false prophet.

1559
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,500
I think it was a demon.

1560
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,060
It's kinda been a demon!

1561
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,360
Okay, now, now I'll walk in.

1562
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,260
Look, I'll speed run.

1563
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:18,720
I'll speed run.

1564
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,760
Okay, I'll believe in you.

1565
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,640
Look, I'm gonna go super fast.

1566
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,260
Brrrr, brrrr, brrrr, brrrr, brrrrr.

1567
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,000
Brrrr, brrrr, brrrr, brrrr.

1568
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,240
Brrrr.

1569
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,280
What?

1570
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,340
Oh.

1571
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,560
You're fine, see?

1572
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:35,840
I need no worry about it.

1573
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:36,580
You're fine with me!

1574
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,820
I don't...

1575
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,500
I...

1576
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,060
You have ears!

1577
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:42,900
She...

1578
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,660
She...

1579
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,920
You have ears!

1580
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,200
What do you mean?

1581
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,760
What?

1582
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,400
You're dead.

1583
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,300
You're dead.

1584
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,060
I am dead.

1585
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:53,840
Humans?

1586
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,260
I'm allegedly a human.

1587
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:56,800
It's okay.

1588
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,040
Your mom paid me extra for overtime.

1589
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,960
Yeah, shut up to my mother.

1590
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,580
She worked the pool.

1591
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,120
Yeah, I was there.

1592
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:05,600
Humans.

1593
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,240
That's where I met your...

1594
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,140
Your neck was the pool.

1595
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,860
That's where I met her.

1596
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,820
Are you my actual dad?

1597
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,660
Cause my mom jokes about me not knowing my real dad all the time.

1598
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,000
And like, it gets to the point where like, I'll laugh and she just will laugh.

1599
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,400
I don't think it was a joke anymore.

1600
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,700
No, that's what I'm thinking.

1601
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,680
Are you my dad?

1602
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,520
Are you actually my...

1603
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,500
Are you gonna...

1604
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,200
Are you gonna Mamma Mia it?

1605
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,940
Where like, you have multiple...

1606
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,640
You don't...

1607
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,220
There's multiple people that could be your dad.

1608
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,480
And you invite all of them to your island.

1609
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:36,840
No!

1610
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,400
I've never seen that movie.

1611
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,200
Oh, me too.

1612
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:39,940
I've never seen it.

1613
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,980
But the premise is apparently like, the same as you.

1614
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,960
She's just like you.

1615
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,400
She doesn't know her dad.

1616
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,620
But like, her mom...

1617
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,620
She's just like...

1618
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,220
I think you should've known her.

1619
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,380
She's just like you.

1620
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,300
And her mom...

1621
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,040
Like...

1622
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,460
Had...

1623
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,400
Had like multiple...

1624
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,160
Encounters.

1625
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,860
With multiple men.

1626
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:00,640
Hey, listen, listen.

1627
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,860
And then she was...

1628
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,940
She's about to get married.

1629
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,240
So she invited all the men that her mom slept with to an island.

1630
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:09,560
Um...

1631
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,380
And they...

1632
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,360
Trying to figure out who is the real dad.

1633
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,340
Jerry Springer!

1634
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:14,520
Who?

1635
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,180
Who?

1636
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,220
The guy is like...

1637
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,260
You know like the guy...

1638
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:18,580
I think...

1639
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:18,960
I think...

1640
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,620
I'm even getting it wrong.

1641
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,620
But the guy who like...

1642
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:20,920
Who like...

1643
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,940
It's like you were not the father.

1644
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,320
And the guys do backflips and stuff.

1645
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,280
Yeah, yeah.

1646
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:25,900
He like...

1647
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,180
They like...

1648
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,480
Entrapped them all on an island.

1649
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,520
And the only way to get out is to...

1650
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,340
Sing ABBA songs.

1651
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:33,720
Oh!

1652
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,760
Yeah, he's like...

1653
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,440
That sounds kinda lit.

1654
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,920
Here we go again.

1655
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,440
My, my, my...

1656
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,140
What if I just play a copyright song...

1657
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,040
Through my mic...

1658
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,620
On your...

1659
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,040
Honestly...

1660
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,460
I'd let you do it.

1661
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,360
Because I seriously don't care anymore.

1662
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,400
I showed gaping airplane butthole on my stream.

1663
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,480
You think the standards...

1664
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,340
You know like how...

1665
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,820
You know like some Twitch streamers...

1666
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,360
They don't care.

1667
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,200
They just use the band as like a vacation.

1668
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,120
Cause it's like...

1669
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,300
You know...

1670
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,220
A three day vacation.

1671
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,440
It's like...

1672
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,480
Sorry...

1673
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:10,800
Uh...

1674
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,560
Spider inside me.

1675
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:18,060
I've never gotten a band before.

1676
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,280
Yeah.

1677
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,200
Please...

1678
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,640
I cannot tell if it's you or not.

1679
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,740
It's actually...

1680
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,760
It's messed up.

1681
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,660
I can't...

1682
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,240
I can't tell.

1683
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,820
I can't tell too.

1684
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,300
You're looking around.

1685
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,540
Stupid.

1686
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:35,640
What happened?

1687
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,180
It looks like you're...

1688
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,160
It's there right now.

1689
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:38,960
I know that was you.

1690
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:39,940
No, I know that one was you.

1691
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,220
That actually was not me.

1692
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,080
What?

1693
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,160
What do you think?

1694
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,220
What do you think?

1695
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:58,440
What do you think?

1696
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,180
I'm being like...

1697
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:00,700
This is like...

1698
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,480
I feel like I'm in a toxic relationship.

1699
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,640
Oh, so like...

1700
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,780
Just like you're...

1701
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,360
Yeah, I know, dude.

1702
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,440
Which one's the pinky daddy?

1703
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,360
A flashlight!

1704
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,540
A flashlight!

1705
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,680
Listen, my mother was a party animal in her days.

1706
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:21,040
Yeah?

1707
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:21,600
But listen.

1708
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,000
Listen.

1709
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,740
At least she left the house.

1710
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,020
She gave word to a daughter who...

1711
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,040
I'm playing Roblox on a Saturday fricking night.

1712
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,420
Like what the frick are we doing?

1713
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,680
We should be out like getting lit.

1714
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:32,920
Right?

1715
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,240
What?

1716
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,580
What?

1717
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,100
What?

1718
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,560
What?

1719
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,120
What?

1720
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,820
Wait, so when was the last time you were out getting lit?

1721
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,260
I...

1722
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:44,900
I...

1723
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,040
I...

1724
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,200
I...

1725
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,360
I...

1726
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,420
I...

1727
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:45,560
I...

1728
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,060
You know the last time I went to...

1729
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,600
It's easier to say it than the two.

1730
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,820
The last time I went to a party, it was...

1731
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,140
High school anti-prob with theater kids.

1732
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,080
Oh my...

1733
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,660
Wait, you were a theater kid?

1734
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,280
Yeah, I was an improv kid.

1735
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,100
Oh my god!

1736
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,280
I explained so much.

1737
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,560
No, like I don't have a bath.

1738
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,480
I just want to explain that.

1739
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,060
I just explained...

1740
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,240
At least you weren't a bad kid.

1741
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,840
No, it was not.

1742
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,800
Those guys were wild.

1743
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:17,960
Those guys...

1744
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,980
I know, they were like t-pose and like whipping Nae Nae.

1745
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,960
They were like...

1746
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,200
They were like actually whipping it.

1747
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,400
Yeah, they'd like t-pose and go, oh my god.

1748
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,640
It's in the middle of class.

1749
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,680
Oh my god, you're at 62!

1750
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:31,960
Yo!

1751
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,440
Mods add...

1752
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,020
Wait, one...

1753
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,300
Mods add me.

1754
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,400
Add seven more.

1755
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,440
Add seven more.

1756
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:37,820
Add seven more.

1757
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,660
Did you get the key?

1758
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,880
There was a key on the second drawer.

1759
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,860
What would I do without you?

1760
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,440
Were you the voices speaking to me?

1761
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,080
Are you gone?

1762
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:47,940
Pick it up!

1763
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:48,500
No!

1764
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,060
Pick it up!

1765
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,380
Pick it up!

1766
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,040
Pick it up!

1767
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,480
I can't get it!

1768
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,180
No!

1769
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,200
Oh, I got it!

1770
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:58,980
I had it that whole time.

1771
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,080
Maybe we should turn it off...

1772
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,120
Turn on child mode.

1773
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:04,680
Child mode?

1774
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,120
You...

1775
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,000
You want that?

1776
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,880
No, I said child mode.

1777
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,540
Oh, I thought you said chat mode.

1778
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,300
I was like you...

1779
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,800
I'm good in here, right?

1780
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,520
Yeah, you are.

1781
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:14,740
You're in the room.

1782
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,140
Good, cool.

1783
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,140
You don't know me.

1784
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,580
Oh?

1785
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,500
Oh, Jesus.

1786
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:20,940
Whoa!

1787
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,280
That's some...

1788
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:22,700
That's...

1789
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,340
That's your dad.

1790
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,100
Oh, no.

1791
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,660
No, I'm kidding.

1792
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,760
I love my dad.

1793
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,740
If that was my uncle, I'd be scared.

1794
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:32,580
Alright.

1795
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:33,780
Oh!

1796
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,040
There's the room.

1797
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:36,720
There's the room.

1798
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,760
Okay, there's...

1799
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,280
There's...

1800
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,540
Yeah, but that one has the key.

1801
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,580
Oh, so it's this one?

1802
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:41,960
Yeah.

1803
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:43,540
Okay.

1804
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:44,960
Good.

1805
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,120
Thank you.

1806
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,540
How did you know that?

1807
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,400
I didn't.

1808
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,020
I just...

1809
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,940
I took the camera.

1810
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,440
I 50-50'd it.

1811
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:55,780
Oh, I took an edible.

1812
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,600
I'm getting lit!

1813
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,560
Oh, shit!

1814
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:58,820
Go outside!

1815
00:54:59,180 --> 00:54:59,900
Go outside!

1816
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:00,660
Oh!

1817
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,900
I'm getting lit!

1818
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:03,620
Flush!

1819
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:04,340
Flush!

1820
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:04,640
Oh, frick!

1821
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,440
Wait, what are you...

1822
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,740
What are you supposed to do in this room?

1823
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,600
You just go forward?

1824
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:08,620
Oh!

1825
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,080
Every time it, like, goes crazy on your screen, you have to turn around.

1826
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:12,660
Ah!

1827
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,220
Oh!

1828
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,860
Oh, it's this one!

1829
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:15,460
Yeah!

1830
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,500
Oh, I just see...

1831
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,360
Oh, so you are...

1832
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,020
You're literally fighting your inner demons, because all I see...

1833
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:20,540
I took a Benadryl.

1834
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,620
All I see is just you in the hallway, like, just running back and forth.

1835
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,900
That's literally all I see.

1836
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,180
Like, it looks...

1837
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:27,680
It's the hat man.

1838
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,800
It's the hat man.

1839
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,720
Have you ever seen him?

1840
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,060
No, I've never seen the hat man.

1841
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,480
Well, one time...

1842
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,760
One time I took a Mucinex and I played patty-cake with him.

1843
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,340
Oh!

1844
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:35,800
No!

1845
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,240
He won.

1846
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,760
Oh, frick!

1847
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,000
You got this!

1848
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:43,720
You're almost there!

1849
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,940
Wait, I think I did it!

1850
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:45,760
Yeah, you did it!

1851
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,060
Yeah!

1852
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:46,580
Ah!

1853
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,500
Why did you look back?

1854
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,720
Why...

1855
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,860
Why did you look at it?

1856
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,940
I...I don't know!

1857
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,920
Because I was turning around in the minigame.

1858
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,240
It was, like, instinctual.

1859
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,960
Watch this, I'm gonna time it.

1860
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,860
Alright, I'm watching.

1861
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,600
Okay.

1862
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,540
I'm watching.

1863
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:08,940
Yeah, he left.

1864
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,260
Watch this.

1865
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:10,980
Watch this.

1866
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,640
Watch this.

1867
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:22,170
Watch this.

1868
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,390
Watch this.

1869
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:25,910
Watch this.

1870
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,890
Watch this.

1871
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,230
Watch this.

1872
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:41,710
After the stream is over, I'll send you a clip.

1873
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,150
Why is this going to scare you?

1874
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,550
It's for eight-year-olds.

1875
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:45,530
Like, what the frick?

1876
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:48,930
Don't worry.

1877
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:55,550
It definitely looked as bad as how it does.

1878
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,090
Look at our profile pictures.

1879
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,770
Like, look at you.

1880
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,650
It definitely looked as bad as what you think it is.

1881
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,030
Did I just die?

1882
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,910
Did I even... Was I close?

1883
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:13,770
Oh, I'm sure you were, sweetie.

1884
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,730
Dang it.

1885
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:16,930
I just needed to make it one more room.

1886
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,670
Oh, no.

1887
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,930
Not nice.

1888
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,630
Not nice.

1889
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:25,410
Oh, wait.

1890
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:26,590
I actually went back to the lobby.

1891
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:27,750
Oh, that's okay.

1892
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:29,010
All right.

1893
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,290
I'll wait for you in the lobby.

1894
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,150
I like people watching in Roblox.

1895
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,750
Have you seen some people's avatars?

1896
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:35,090
Oh, yeah.

1897
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:35,310
I know.

1898
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,750
Some people have seen avatars.

1899
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:38,550
Okay.

1900
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,010
Why does it look like I'm pooping?

1901
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:41,690
Do you see this?

1902
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:42,110
What?

1903
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,750
It looks like I'm pooping.

1904
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:46,810
Oh, wait.

1905
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:47,970
You look like a... Oh, wait.

1906
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:48,730
Oh, my God.

1907
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,070
You look like a goddamn shrimp.

1908
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,090
With ass.

1909
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,150
My wife showed a baby.

1910
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:59,370
You look like you had, like... It looks like you got, like, a Brazilian butt lift.

1911
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,050
Oh, yeah, dude.

1912
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:01,430
Yeah.

1913
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:03,450
Yeah, but you only... I'm actually raising... I'm raising sub money.

1914
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:05,370
But you only focused on the butt.

1915
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,030
Yeah, the thighs don't match.

1916
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:09,410
Yeah, the other... Nothing else matters.

1917
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,470
It's just the butt.

1918
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:11,470
Oh, my God.

1919
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:12,050
Did you see that?

1920
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:12,970
Did you see Lucy?

1921
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:17,970
Oh, Lucy... Lucy went for, like, an actual Brazilian butt lift.

1922
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,670
Actual B... Well... Yeah.

1923
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:21,430
I don't know.

1924
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:24,190
I feel like the only reason I would get a BBL is because I'd use it...

1925
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:24,870
Oh, hey, it's your friend.

1926
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,510
Oh, that's Queso.

1927
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:27,050
What's that front?

1928
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:27,170
Yeah, it's your friend.

1929
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:27,590
Yeah.

1930
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,950
Oh, hold up.

1931
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:29,130
Hold up.

1932
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:29,270
Hold up.

1933
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:29,930
Oh, shit.

1934
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,150
Hi.

1935
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:37,310
That's my mod.

1936
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:38,570
That's your mod?

1937
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:39,530
Your Queso?

1938
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:39,710
Yeah.

1939
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,490
Yeah, Queso's my mod.

1940
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,390
Lord PuszPusz?

1941
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,310
Yeah, Lord PuszPusz.

1942
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,450
Is he also 40?

1943
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:50,850
Actually, I don't know how old he is, but he sounds like the doctor from TF2.

1944
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:54,570
So he's, like, he's, like, 60 then.

1945
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:01,110
Oh my god, it's Dragon Ball.

1946
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,750
Oh my god, is this real?

1947
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:04,230
Oh my god, are you real?

1948
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:05,610
At chat, are you real?

1949
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:07,470
Grog, is this true?

1950
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,510
At Grog, is this true?

1951
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,810
What movie is... At Grog, what show is this?

1952
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:13,670
Oh god.

1953
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:16,850
Is that Goku, guys?

1954
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,370
Oh my god, it's Goku, everyone!

1955
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:20,590
Whoa!

1956
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,450
Whoa!

1957
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,530
No, I think it's Piccolo.

1958
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,150
It's DokiBird69, I missed her.

1959
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:29,090
Yeah, let's get DokiBird69 here, and we'll do an Endocarius.

1960
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,710
Yeah, DokiBird69, get in here.

1961
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,810
Join Chibu's lobby.

1962
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,690
One of the Doki's will succeed, right?

1963
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,310
Yeah, eventually battle it out.

1964
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:48,790
Okay, if your name has a Doki in it, join our lobby.

1965
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:53,390
Yeah, and then we'll have a four... Yeah, yeah, we'll get the Dokiverse in here.

1966
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:58,710
Dude, you know how many parasocial people from your chat are downloading Roblox right now?

1967
00:59:59,450 --> 00:59:59,850
It's okay!

1968
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,430
I said the Dokiverse.

1969
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,470
It could be either of us.

1970
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,850
Dude, I'm eye-level with Thomas.

1971
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:09,470
Yeah?

1972
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:10,390
You want me in the bags?

1973
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:11,970
Oh, bleh bleh bleh bleh.

1974
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:15,110
What were you doing to Thomas, Chibi?

1975
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,090
I was giving him a check-up.

1976
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:22,370
Oh yeah, by the way, remember when you get older, you gotta check your prostate or you get prostate cancer.

1977
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,090
Yeah.

1978
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:23,670
Yeah, yeah.

1979
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,450
Yeah, actually true.

1980
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,170
You also need to practice for the exam.

1981
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:26,970
Yeah, you...

1982
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:28,990
You gotta study for it.

1983
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,270
You gotta practice for it.

1984
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:33,630
If you know how to check for cancer, you don't have to pay the doctors.

1985
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,350
Exactly.

1986
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:35,630
Check yourself for lumps.

1987
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,250
Yeah, check yourself for lumps.

1988
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,550
Just...

1989
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:39,450
It's actually true.

1990
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:40,990
Guys, we're not fucking with you guys.

1991
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:43,890
The older you get, the more likely you'll get prostate cancer.

1992
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:44,370
So you got...

1993
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,330
Yeah, it's really common.

1994
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:47,790
Yeah, it's very common when you're older.

1995
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,370
It's like girls should be checked for breast cancer.

1996
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,110
Guys, go get your kidney holes touched.

1997
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:53,230
Yeah.

1998
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:56,630
It's easier for the girls because we...

1999
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,350
Because we're so old.

2000
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:03,750
Have you ever had a mammogram?

2001
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,190
No, have you?

2002
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,450
No, I have not, but I'm kind of looking forward to it.

2003
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,010
To be fair, I feel like you'll need to.

2004
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:10,570
What?

2005
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,150
I feel like if there's a lump, it'll like protrude.

2006
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,490
I'll go up a cup size, is that what you're saying?

2007
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,010
God dang it!

2008
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:25,090
You'll know when you look in the mirror and you have breast cancer.

2009
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,710
My boobs will look like cottage cheese.

2010
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:27,770
Like, God dang it.

2011
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,690
There's freaking Owl Odie behind me.

2012
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:32,430
Yeah.

2013
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:33,690
Look at him.

2014
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,190
Oh my God, he's twerking!

2015
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:41,970
Guys, I think those are all our fans, Guys, change your name if you want to join up a lot.

2016
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:42,990
Hold on, I'm gonna stop speaking to them.

2017
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:43,230
Hold on.

2018
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:44,270
You guys gotta change...

2019
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,130
Do you actually have the mic option?

2020
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,550
Oh, I do actually.

2021
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:48,650
Oh, I'm scared.

2022
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:49,890
I'm scared of the children.

2023
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:51,110
You guys are losers.

2024
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,310
I just had someone...

2025
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,690
Which one's mouth breathing though?

2026
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,290
I'm scared we need to go upstairs.

2027
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,170
This is why I don't have the mic option because...

2028
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:06,750
First off, I'm scared children will talk in my...

2029
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:09,550
Like, children and I don't want to...

2030
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:11,590
It's all my...

2031
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:13,350
Oh my God, there's...

2032
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:16,110
Guys, I don't think this is for...

2033
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:18,390
I don't think these are for my fans.

2034
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,470
I think they're your fans.

2035
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,450
Don't worry, I'm in a chair watching in the corner.

2036
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:22,370
You cock.

2037
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:23,610
I'm looking...

2038
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:24,530
Hashtag Sneeko.

2039
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,770
Where the freak are you?

2040
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:28,330
Where did you go?

2041
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,010
We're gonna go lockdown!

2042
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:30,690
Yeah!

2043
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,050
All right, and he...

2044
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,850
Oh my God, see...

2045
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,730
Now that's an avatar right there.

2046
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:37,950
All right, any Doki's?

2047
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:41,530
Guys, if you want to join us, you have to have a Doki name, guys.

2048
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:44,450
That's the whole point of the Doki verse.

2049
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:45,430
We have, like, new ch...

2050
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:46,210
New members.

2051
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:47,910
Who the frick is this little baby?

2052
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:49,090
Look at this infant.

2053
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:50,850
What the frick are you?

2054
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,190
Are you trying to fight another...

2055
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:55,530
Oh my God, look at this!

2056
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:57,070
There's an actual baby in here.

2057
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,210
Now that's a baby.

2058
01:02:58,510 --> 01:02:58,950
Punt it.

2059
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,330
Yeah, punt that child.

2060
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:02,550
All right, any Doki's?

2061
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:03,550
I don't see a Doki yet.

2062
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,470
I see another Goku.

2063
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:06,850
Oh, I think we're nobodies.

2064
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:08,250
We're...

2065
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:10,630
I'm Doki in spirit.

2066
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:11,750
I'm not breathing, I'm scared.

2067
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,910
Look, I don't want a Minecraft situation here.

2068
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:18,090
I...

2069
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,430
Oh, that implies a lot of things.

2070
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,370
This is what...

2071
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:25,370
Like I said, this is why I'm afraid of turning on...

2072
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:27,430
Turning on the mic option.

2073
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:29,370
I didn't...

2074
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,790
I never turned it on, it just...

2075
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,370
Who did they whispering at me?

2076
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:35,850
Some kid just like, you should be Super Mario.

2077
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:39,350
You should play Super Mario 3.

2078
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,190
All right, I started the...

2079
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:44,630
Yeah, I gotta go.

2080
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,270
God just told me to play a...

2081
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:47,770
Super Mario 3.

2082
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:52,950
All right, since there's no Doki's, we gotta do a two rumor.

2083
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:54,670
Maybe next round, maybe next round.

2084
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,030
Yeah, next round, maybe next round.

2085
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,090
I can't get the...

2086
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:57,450
Goodbye.

2087
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,030
No, you're in, you're in, don't worry.

2088
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,290
Don't worry, you're in.

2089
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:01,230
You're in.

2090
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:02,390
Don't leave me here, Michael.

2091
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:06,210
Don't leave me here with my demons.

2092
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:07,590
All right.

2093
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:09,310
Let's see.

2094
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:11,310
I do have...

2095
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,950
Oh, actually, the...

2096
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:14,650
No, we're fine.

2097
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:15,310
Yeah?

2098
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,090
Yeah, what are you doing?

2099
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:19,890
I'm warming up.

2100
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:21,650
All right, we're in.

2101
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,850
All right, our best...

2102
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,190
Our best room was 68.

2103
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:27,830
That's our first attempt?

2104
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:28,330
Yeah.

2105
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:29,170
That's our first attempt, right?

2106
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,850
That's not bad.

2107
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,050
Yeah, that's pretty good for you.

2108
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:32,170
You really spent like 400 Robux.

2109
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:37,310
Yeah, and then we spent like 60% of that time in that room trying to guess the number.

2110
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:40,830
Who would have possibly known it was one?

2111
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,170
Who would have possibly known?

2112
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:42,390
I don't know.

2113
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,710
I would have started at...

2114
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:45,570
I would have honestly started at zero.

2115
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:50,030
So, instead of randomly choosing seven, I don't know.

2116
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:52,270
According to my calculations, there was no way it could have been one.

2117
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:53,170
Oh my god, that's bad apple.

2118
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:54,070
What is it?

2119
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,390
Oh, but...

2120
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:56,110
No, no, no, no, no.

2121
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:57,650
Ever on and on?

2122
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:00,110
That is such a good song.

2123
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,810
I used to listen to that song and play Minecraft.

2124
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:02,770
Bad apple?

2125
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:03,810
Yeah.

2126
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:15,710
Have you actually played Toho before?

2127
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:19,190
No, but it's been on my playlist since I was like 10.

2128
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,290
The games look so freaking cool and I love the music.

2129
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:23,490
Yeah, the music's really...

2130
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:24,770
I've never actually played Toho either.

2131
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:27,030
I don't even know what the plot of Toho is.

2132
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:32,910
I know it's like everything because there's like a lot of games and a lot of characters and it's like supposedly really good.

2133
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:34,850
Like there's a lot of characters and stuff.

2134
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,090
Have you played the horse game yet?

2135
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:45,190
I downloaded it yesterday, but I decided I want to play it on stream with chat since they really like it.

2136
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:46,650
Wait, even there's multiplayer?

2137
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:48,650
There is?

2138
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:51,450
Wait, oh, you mean like you play it on stream.

2139
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,250
Oh, I'm parasocial.

2140
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:53,530
I'm parasocial.

2141
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:53,670
Yeah.

2142
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:56,810
I'm a freaking loser.

2143
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,430
You're parasocial to your chat.

2144
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,150
I'm gonna have a collab room if I'm yours.

2145
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:02,190
You're not.

2146
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:09,150
I thought you meant like racing like chat chat.

2147
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:10,930
Let's see who has the best horse.

2148
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,490
Oh, there is multiplayer.

2149
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,530
Oh, there is?

2150
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:15,970
Yeah.

2151
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:21,590
All I know is I like the girl with the like gold and something who has like white hair and she looks up the camera.

2152
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:23,150
Oh, gold shit?

2153
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,930
That's that's that's her name.

2154
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:25,490
Gold shit.

2155
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,090
I don't know.

2156
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,570
I don't know.

2157
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,710
I never played a gold ship.

2158
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:33,050
Yeah.

2159
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,790
No ship as in like a boat.

2160
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:36,950
Oh my god.

2161
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:39,770
I was like...

2162
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:54,170
I don't even know it because it's like on my it's been on my Twitter feed apparently like she's like apparently like an actual really good horse and because they're all named after real horses and stuff and she's like a little shit.

2163
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,590
She is a little shit though.

2164
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:58,370
And like very like silly and like random.

2165
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:58,490
Yeah, yeah.

2166
01:06:58,710 --> 01:06:59,350
Oh, there you are.

2167
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:00,190
I'm here.

2168
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:00,870
Peek-a-boo.

2169
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:03,330
What?

2170
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:04,570
What?

2171
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:05,870
Okay, now I don't know what that was.

2172
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:07,170
I...

2173
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:07,550
What?

2174
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,110
Let's move on.

2175
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:08,790
What?

2176
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:13,090
No, I just I'm having issues and I already have like mental like...

2177
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,790
I mean you ate salt.

2178
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:16,310
So...

2179
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:17,090
I did.

2180
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:18,510
I did.

2181
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:18,830
I did.

2182
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:19,610
I also ate crayons.

2183
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:20,490
Wait, what?

2184
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,450
Dude, they smell good.

2185
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:23,310
I've eaten a lot of you.

2186
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,150
Wait, how old were you?

2187
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:26,830
Not that old like 10.

2188
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,070
Okay, so that was not bad.

2189
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:30,170
No.

2190
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,190
It's up here.

2191
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,950
Don't go in this door.

2192
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:43,570
Do not.

2193
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:45,290
Oh, I don't.

2194
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:46,070
I...

2195
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:47,090
Don't worry.

2196
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:47,830
I...

2197
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:48,570
I know.

2198
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:53,290
Dude, is that what got you before the guy would grab you?

2199
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:54,070
Yeah.

2200
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,410
Oh, uh...

2201
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:56,710
Yeah?

2202
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:57,470
Eh.

2203
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:00,230
What's in the Roomba?

2204
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:04,190
Did we both try to steal each other?

2205
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,480
Oh, I'm dead.

2206
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,580
We got in too early.

2207
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,820
Wait, did you die?

2208
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,280
I need to die.

2209
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,340
Give me the back shots.

2210
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:17,420
What?

2211
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,120
You're ripping his waist.

2212
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,960
I didn't die.

2213
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,540
I got in too early.

2214
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:27,760
Because I thought he was right behind us.

2215
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,140
Wait, did you die too?

2216
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,920
Oh wait, you're alive.

2217
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,640
Rez me.

2218
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,080
Rez you?

2219
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:38,340
Okay.

2220
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:39,140
Rez me.

2221
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:39,720
Wait.

2222
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:40,480
Wait.

2223
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,220
Rez me.

2224
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:41,540
Wait.

2225
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:41,920
Oh my god.

2226
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:42,760
I can kick you around.

2227
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,340
Rez me.

2228
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,440
Rez me.

2229
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:47,980
Rez me.

2230
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:48,780
Rez me.

2231
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,340
Rez me.

2232
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,360
I have...

2233
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,640
I have all.

2234
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,220
Rez me.

2235
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:54,940
Yeah, come on.

2236
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,140
Oh, thank you.

2237
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:56,520
Hey.

2238
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:57,620
You know...

2239
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:58,700
You know you...

2240
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:58,920
Where'd you go?

2241
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,020
I had Robux.

2242
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,180
You owe me.

2243
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,060
You owe me.

2244
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,540
That was like 30 cents, dude.

2245
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,920
Wait, where are you?

2246
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,840
I don't know.

2247
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,820
Where the frick are you?

2248
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,100
I'm in a room with paintings.

2249
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:15,140
Wait, me too.

2250
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:16,520
Wait, where are you?

2251
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,100
Wait, are we desigged or something?

2252
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,420
Wait, where...

2253
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,060
Wait.

2254
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,020
You're trolling me again.

2255
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,320
You're trolling me again.

2256
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,480
There's no way.

2257
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,480
You pillow princess motherfucker.

2258
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:28,600
I'm doing the puzzle.

2259
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,720
And you're watching from the sneaker chair again.

2260
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,020
I just don't know where I am.

2261
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,200
Where the frick are you?

2262
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,100
I don't know.

2263
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,700
I got money though.

2264
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,040
I spent 30 cents on you.

2265
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,420
Nice.

2266
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:42,920
Chat.

2267
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:43,880
I will never financially recover.

2268
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,060
Chat, can we get a gifted sub?

2269
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,180
Wait, I see you!

2270
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:48,900
You're just...

2271
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,200
I see you're in the darkness.

2272
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,460
Where are you?

2273
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,240
Get all the way over here.

2274
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:53,840
I don't know.

2275
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,520
I know that was you because I heard the frickin' spit on your lips motherfucker.

2276
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,020
And I know that was you too.

2277
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,740
Okay, do you know why I know it's you?

2278
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,340
Because you're louder than the actual game!

2279
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,900
You're like 2 times louder.

2280
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,300
I know that was you.

2281
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,660
What, what, what?

2282
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,740
That wasn't me?

2283
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,520
I think that was a spider, whoa.

2284
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,980
You're like 2 times louder than the game.

2285
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,930
Isn't that...

2286
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,360
Are they not coming?

2287
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:34,220
Oh, it is.

2288
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,480
Alright, we're good.

2289
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:45,480
I wasn't up to anything nefarious.

2290
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,680
Let us continue on our...

2291
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,260
That like took so long though.

2292
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,880
That was like actual forever.

2293
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,040
Sorry.

2294
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:58,850
Demons.

2295
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,090
Don't worry, your inner demons.

2296
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,350
Aren't you used to that though?

2297
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,990
Your entire existence is like fighting your inner demons.

2298
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,590
I took my vitamins today.

2299
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,630
My mom gave them to me in a piece of cheese and everything.

2300
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,090
Yeah, and then if you don't hear...

2301
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:23,110
No, if you don't take your meds, chat...

2302
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,790
If you take your meds, chat will disappear.

2303
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:29,810
They literally have a command to time themselves out.

2304
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:31,910
So whenever I do take my pills onto...

2305
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,730
Like my vitamins when I forget...

2306
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:33,910
Yeah?

2307
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:34,790
Everyone leaves.

2308
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:35,690
Yeah.

2309
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:39,210
Everyone just do exclamation point bad.

2310
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:42,370
Yeah, it's really freaking sad.

2311
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:44,370
Cause it's like seeing like my dog get put down.

2312
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:45,310
Oh shit.

2313
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,250
They just all just go away.

2314
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:46,870
Oh, you are...

2315
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,350
You are a parasocial.

2316
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,930
Uh, dude, it's...

2317
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:50,570
It's sad.

2318
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:51,830
Like all I do...

2319
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:51,970
It's...

2320
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:53,030
It's so freaking pathetic.

2321
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,110
I think it's so freaking pathetic.

2322
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:58,870
I wouldn't say that.

2323
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,670
Why?

2324
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:02,670
Oh, hey, it's right here.

2325
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:06,110
I like how if you take too long, though like it starts glowing.

2326
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:07,810
Like, cause we're like kids.

2327
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:09,710
I know.

2328
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:12,450
You're like...

2329
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:13,390
We're like eight year old.

2330
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:14,190
You're like...

2331
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:14,970
We don't even know where the buttons are.

2332
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,530
We need a yellow paint right now.

2333
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:16,910
Alright.

2334
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:20,290
This game needs some yellow paint on the doors.

2335
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:24,310
I swear to God, if I turn this corner and you're a smear.

2336
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:25,170
I swear to God.

2337
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:26,190
I'm okay.

2338
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:28,470
I'm okay.

2339
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:29,870
I'm okay.

2340
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:30,110
Are you?

2341
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:31,010
I'm...

2342
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:31,710
I'm alright.

2343
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:32,190
Here I am.

2344
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:32,830
I'm okay.

2345
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:34,270
Alright, it's this one.

2346
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:36,230
I just heard a...

2347
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:37,850
Alright.

2348
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:38,570
25.

2349
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,250
Apparently it was not 26.

2350
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:43,290
Who would have thought?

2351
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:45,230
Ooh.

2352
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:48,390
I'm sure we don't need that.

2353
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,790
Okay.

2354
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:51,150
Okay.

2355
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:54,970
Oh, it's here.

2356
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:57,250
Oh, I don't like that.

2357
01:12:59,270 --> 01:12:59,970
That's creepy.

2358
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:00,910
It's so dark in here.

2359
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:01,310
Yeah.

2360
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:04,210
I think that's where you just go for it, though.

2361
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,510
The silhouette of your tank engine makes me feel a lot more safe.

2362
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:08,270
Oh.

2363
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,190
I don't know about that.

2364
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,470
It's so dark.

2365
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:15,070
What the fuck?

2366
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,430
Where the fuck is the light?

2367
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:19,150
What the fuck?

2368
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:20,250
Oh, there it is.

2369
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:20,510
My turn.

2370
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:20,930
My turn.

2371
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,770
Oh, I don't like that.

2372
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:24,210
That means...

2373
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:24,990
Oh, wait, no.

2374
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:25,950
This is the running one.

2375
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,470
We're fine.

2376
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:27,270
Oh, yeah.

2377
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:28,110
Okay, okay.

2378
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:30,070
We're gonna have to start running.

2379
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:31,390
Alright.

2380
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:32,810
I might die, though.

2381
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,970
I'm not very good at this one.

2382
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:36,410
No, you won't live.

2383
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:36,890
Alright.

2384
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:38,450
Show me where we have to go.

2385
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:39,230
Okay.

2386
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:39,950
I'll...

2387
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:40,430
Sorry.

2388
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:40,970
Hold up.

2389
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:41,610
Wait, wait, wait, hang on.

2390
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:42,210
Move baby!

2391
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:44,370
Yeah, we're here, baby.

2392
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:47,670
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

2393
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,910
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!

2394
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,390
Have you ever tried seeing Tibi?

2395
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:54,790
Uh, yes, but then everyone told me this shot-off.

2396
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:58,670
Okay, but who's everyone, though?

2397
01:13:59,150 --> 01:13:59,690
Who's everyone?

2398
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:00,670
My mom.

2399
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:06,710
I- I don't know how to sing.

2400
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:07,990
I sing for fun.

2401
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:10,250
Have you ever- Oh, shit.

2402
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:10,990
I'm okay.

2403
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:11,470
Hold up.

2404
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,590
Look at you, you're a pro.

2405
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:14,490
There we go.

2406
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,310
I'm alive.

2407
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,910
Have you ever tried doing a karaoke stream?

2408
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:26,510
Um... Well, the thing is, I- I want to, but I'm- I am, like, I don't know how to sing.

2409
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:29,430
Okay, but how many subs will get you a karaoke stream?

2410
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:31,850
I would do it for free.

2411
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:32,990
Oh.

2412
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:33,770
Yeah.

2413
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:37,150
Unless people want to give me money, then $10,000.

2414
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,470
For free or $10,000?

2415
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:42,550
I'm a streamer.

2416
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:43,410
I want money.

2417
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:49,270
I feel like cats are food motivated.

2418
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,430
Streamers, dude.

2419
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,190
Streamers are money.

2420
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:54,750
I think we'll be fine here.

2421
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:56,550
Yeah, see?

2422
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:58,130
He doesn't know how to go into rooms.

2423
01:14:59,190 --> 01:14:59,590
Stupid.

2424
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:00,750
Yeah, stupid.

2425
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,090
What are you?

2426
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:02,950
A child?

2427
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,070
Okay, let's not throw around that one.

2428
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:11,010
Dude, the spiders hate me, dude.

2429
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:12,710
Stop.

2430
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:13,650
Stop.

2431
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,890
I can- I- I like- Like, I can tell sometimes when it's you, but I still check.

2432
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:21,890
Like, when you're like, I know that's you.

2433
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:25,650
Can you really tell, though?

2434
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:28,190
Can you really tell when I go- Stop.

2435
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,270
Women scare me, dude.

2436
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:33,290
They never know when they want to eat food and they go- Women scare me.

2437
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:36,530
Are you okay?

2438
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:39,230
Yeah, I just remembered you're a woman.

2439
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:41,470
You just thought about it.

2440
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:44,650
It's like, holy shit, I'm collabing with a woman right now.

2441
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:46,710
Are you good?

2442
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:47,590
Yeah, I'm good.

2443
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,110
I thought you forgot about it.

2444
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,350
You're just like, woman!

2445
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,290
Tits, tits, tits.

2446
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,690
Just think about tits.

2447
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:08,030
I don't remember that.

2448
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,070
You know something about women?

2449
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,290
We never forget.

2450
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:12,870
That's true.

2451
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,170
That's true.

2452
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,120
It's so dark in here.

2453
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,700
I found the door, I found the door.

2454
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,100
Nice.

2455
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,500
Oh, I found a bandaid.

2456
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,300
Oh my god, it only does that much.

2457
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,020
Just one bandaid.

2458
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:48,300
Oh shit.

2459
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,440
Oh shit, what hit me?

2460
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,880
What hit me?

2461
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,480
It means something hit me.

2462
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,300
Oh shit, it's the eye.

2463
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,180
What are you doing?

2464
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,640
Get the fuck off of me.

2465
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,520
Wait, what is my head doing?

2466
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,000
Why am I, like, motorboating the floor?

2467
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:19,530
Why did he die?

2468
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,790
I'll never be a good person again.

2469
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:26,870
Dude, you died of cringe.

2470
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:34,790
I tried to res you, and the moment I was trying to res you, the fucking... the spot it showed up.

2471
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:42,470
So I was stuck in the loading thing to get you up, and then the spider fucking ran at me.

2472
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:45,450
Dude, my character's twerking.

2473
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:46,270
Do you see this?

2474
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:46,870
Ding!

2475
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:49,450
She's throwing it back.

2476
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:50,330
Do you see that?

2477
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:54,230
I can't see it because I'm fucking dead.

2478
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:56,070
What do you mean?

2479
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:57,390
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2480
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:57,950
Go to the lobby.

2481
01:17:58,130 --> 01:17:58,530
Go to the lobby.

2482
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,050
The lobby?

2483
01:17:59,210 --> 01:17:59,330
Okay.

2484
01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:00,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2485
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:02,670
So we can see if there's any other jokies.

2486
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:03,530
Yeah.

2487
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:04,110
Alright.

2488
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:06,890
Alright, where are the jokies?

2489
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,150
In the jokieverse.

2490
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:11,430
How do I go to the lobby?

2491
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:13,310
Oh, it's returned to... yeah.

2492
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:17,810
Alright, are there any jokies?

2493
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:20,270
I saw CoolKid69.

2494
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:21,930
Oh, heck yeah.

2495
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,310
Nice.

2496
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:25,730
There's no jokies yet.

2497
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,070
I can't believe it.

2498
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:27,670
The jokies69...

2499
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:29,390
They don't like us.

2500
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,750
jokies69 added you, and then never showed up.

2501
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:32,690
That's fucked.

2502
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:34,410
Maybe it's my dad.

2503
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:37,370
Ooh.

2504
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:38,790
He never showed up.

2505
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:39,770
He never showed up?

2506
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:41,150
Don't worry, he'll show up.

2507
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,210
He just...

2508
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,070
You love your dad, that doesn't exist.

2509
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:47,190
No, no, my dad's in the other room playing...

2510
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:47,550
Playing...

2511
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:48,690
What's it called?

2512
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:49,990
It's okay.

2513
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:51,490
It's okay, you don't have to lie.

2514
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,830
You don't have to lie to us.

2515
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:53,670
It's okay, we're...

2516
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:54,070
He's playing Clash of Clans.

2517
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:55,050
We're here for you.

2518
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:56,430
You don't have to lie for us.

2519
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:57,370
We're here for you, chibi.

2520
01:18:57,370 --> 01:19:01,030
He's playing Clash of Clans on his iPad while watching the gold digger show.

2521
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,290
Where they dig gold.

2522
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:04,150
It's okay, chibi.

2523
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:04,810
We're here.

2524
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:06,330
We understand and we listen.

2525
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:07,630
Thanks, dad.

2526
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:09,470
Thanks.

2527
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:11,750
We're here for you.

2528
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:14,710
Chat can be...

2529
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:15,730
Wait, actually, no, that's bad.

2530
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:17,970
What?

2531
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,350
Chat can be my dad?

2532
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:19,970
Yeah.

2533
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:21,210
Oh, Jesus.

2534
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:22,030
That's gonna...

2535
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:23,030
No, I can't...

2536
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:23,970
That's a pipe one.

2537
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:25,070
No, that...

2538
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:25,550
I don't think you're not...

2539
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:26,770
You're not at that extent yet.

2540
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:27,530
You're not there yet.

2541
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:28,830
Give it a couple years.

2542
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:29,290
Give it...

2543
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:31,170
No, give it until like...

2544
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:33,150
Give it until...

2545
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,270
Until your...

2546
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:34,870
Your...

2547
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:35,390
Anniversary.

2548
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:38,690
That's super...

2549
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:41,530
That's still...

2550
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:41,710
Oh, shit.

2551
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:42,310
Hey, that's...

2552
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,570
Oh, I got the name.

2553
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:44,470
The name.

2554
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:45,650
That's a job application.

2555
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,030
No, look at the name.

2556
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:49,310
Which one?

2557
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:49,670
That one?

2558
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:50,150
Oh, jeez.

2559
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:50,550
Which one?

2560
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:50,930
Matt?

2561
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:52,790
Or the job application?

2562
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:53,830
No, the job application.

2563
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:54,850
The job application.

2564
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:57,110
Look at the name on the job application.

2565
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:59,150
And that's in reference to Diddy Kong.

2566
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:00,010
From Mario.

2567
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:00,470
Grow up.

2568
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:00,930
Grow up.

2569
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:01,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2570
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:02,390
Grow up.

2571
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:04,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2572
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:05,310
Grow up.

2573
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:06,910
Diddy Kong with, like, Paulina.

2574
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:09,090
I love Pauline!

2575
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:12,150
Yeah, but... but then they replaced Diddy Kong.

2576
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:14,310
He literally took her job.

2577
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,090
She took her... took his job.

2578
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:18,190
Wait, did they really kick him out?

2579
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:19,430
Yeah, they kicked him out.

2580
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:20,450
Yeah, you know.

2581
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:23,470
And they made Donkey Kong wear pants.

2582
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:25,390
Oh my god!

2583
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:26,150
DonkeyBird69!

2584
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:26,910
Wait!

2585
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,070
Okay, join us!

2586
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,090
DonkeyBird69, join us, join us.

2587
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:31,710
DonkeyBird69, get over here.

2588
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:32,090
And there's another one!

2589
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:33,150
There's someone named DonkeyMon.

2590
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,210
They're a cosplay agent.

2591
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:34,530
Oh, okay.

2592
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:35,130
We're DonkeyMon.

2593
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:35,610
That's perfect.

2594
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:36,270
Alright, join us.

2595
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:36,850
Four people.

2596
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:37,290
Okay.

2597
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:38,210
Four people.

2598
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:39,350
Alright.

2599
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:41,110
Okay, ready?

2600
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:42,570
Three, two, okay.

2601
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:43,450
Only Doki's in.

2602
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:43,690
Only Doki's in.

2603
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:45,070
Wait, okay, wait, wait.

2604
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:45,390
I saw it!

2605
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:45,610
I saw it!

2606
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:46,690
Get out, get out.

2607
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:48,450
The Doki's gonna get in.

2608
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:49,830
Okay, we'll try again.

2609
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,390
Okay.

2610
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:52,670
Okay, get in here, get in here!

2611
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,150
Oh, which one, which one?

2612
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:54,670
Get in here!

2613
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:55,690
Doki, get in here!

2614
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:56,950
This one?

2615
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:58,490
I'm with the Doki, I'm in!

2616
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,510
The Doki FPS VTuber!

2617
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:02,470
Oh, wait!

2618
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:02,650
Oh, wait!

2619
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:03,850
There you go.

2620
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:05,010
Get wrecked.

2621
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:05,970
Get wrecked.

2622
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:06,550
There we go.

2623
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,110
You see as you lose.

2624
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:08,130
Get the frick out.

2625
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:09,830
There we go.

2626
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:13,570
Oh, we got... Someone... I have to reconnect.

2627
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:15,870
I'm inside something.

2628
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:17,810
What?

2629
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:19,870
Wait, I couldn't even get in the game.

2630
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,710
Wait, I got disconnected.

2631
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:21,750
Hey.

2632
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,210
I got disconnected.

2633
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:25,930
I just saw your boobs.

2634
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:28,510
Okay, we have to make a new lobby.

2635
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:29,310
Okay, you have to leave.

2636
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:30,150
No, I'm staying.

2637
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:31,730
I'm on a date right now.

2638
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:33,270
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2639
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:38,850
This is a Doki lobby and you're missing one of the prime Doki's.

2640
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:40,170
I'm on a date right now.

2641
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,190
With your dad?

2642
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:46,550
No, no, this is... You don't know her.

2643
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,510
She goes to a different chat.

2644
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,830
Oh, she lives in... She lives in Canada, right?

2645
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,950
Yeah, you wouldn't know her.

2646
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:53,850
She's just a cute girl.

2647
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:55,450
I literally live in Canada.

2648
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,590
What do you mean?

2649
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:56,810
Oh, break!

2650
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:02,350
I literally am living in Canada.

2651
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:06,150
Hey, uh...

2652
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:07,510
I gotta go.

2653
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:09,050
I don't... I've never made it this far.

2654
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:09,510
I'm gonna throw up.

2655
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:10,130
Alright, I left.

2656
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:12,710
Alright.

2657
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:13,550
Okay.

2658
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:14,870
Okay, they have to join us again.

2659
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:16,170
Alright, Doki's!

2660
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,290
Doki's, we're ready to try again.

2661
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:18,930
Assemble!

2662
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:19,790
Doki's, assemble!

2663
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:21,550
I'm building a team.

2664
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,210
We have a Doki.

2665
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:28,350
Oh my god, well, because we have two other players, we can make them spend Robux on us.

2666
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:32,210
Okay, so you're... Guys, you're not allowed to do anything except follow us?

2667
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:36,270
Have your tail between your legs, don't sweep them unless you open to you, and buy things for us.

2668
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:38,850
Oh my god, Peter Griffin!

2669
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,170
Wait, I want him to be on our team.

2670
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:43,890
I want him to be on our team.

2671
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,770
Yeah, I'm following his lobby.

2672
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:49,570
I want him on our team.

2673
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:50,750
I want him on our team.

2674
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:53,870
We have Doki's and Peter Griffin.

2675
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:55,050
I like him.

2676
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:55,650
Oh my god, wait!

2677
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,170
Oh my god, that's my dad.

2678
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:57,850
This is my dad.

2679
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:00,750
Oh my god, bring your kid to work day!

2680
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:01,250
Yeah!

2681
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:02,690
Family photo!

2682
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:03,630
And then Goku's behind you.

2683
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,790
Oh my god, me and I have my child right here.

2684
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,830
Chibi Doki.

2685
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,410
When do I grow my train?

2686
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:10,470
Let's go.

2687
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:15,190
Don't talk to me or my child or my child's child again.

2688
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:16,210
Peanut.

2689
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:21,030
Oh my god, they're talking to each other.

2690
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:21,570
Yeah?

2691
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:22,390
What is he saying?

2692
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:23,990
He said, why'd you invite me?

2693
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:24,910
I'm trying to eat my food.

2694
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:30,590
And then he ran away.

2695
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:33,810
I don't know, I feel like I'm listening to a conversation I'm not meant to be a part of.

2696
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:38,230
If they are willing to publicly have a conversation in Roblox, it's free.

2697
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:39,410
It's free game.

2698
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:39,570
That's true.

2699
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:40,970
Why would you...

2700
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:42,750
There's a reason Discord is around.

2701
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:45,170
Why would you choose Roblox to talk to people?

2702
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,350
We need to go, a man just spoke to me and I'm scared.

2703
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,170
There's Chibi...

2704
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,130
Oh, there's Chibi guy.

2705
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:51,490
There's a Chibi person here.

2706
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:54,290
I think that's a regular guy.

2707
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:57,750
Come on.

2708
01:23:58,290 --> 01:23:59,230
Come on, Peter.

2709
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,290
Wait, Doki Mom's here.

2710
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:01,570
Okay.

2711
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:02,710
We have Doki Mom.

2712
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:04,150
Wait, we're still missing one more Doki.

2713
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,570
This guy goes, hello, Chibi.

2714
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:07,410
And I go, I'm scared.

2715
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:08,590
He goes, you shouldn't be scared.

2716
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:09,490
I'm scared.

2717
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:13,950
I'm scared.

2718
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:15,910
I'm scared for you.

2719
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:17,090
I know.

2720
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:18,950
Oh wait !

2721
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:21,790
It's Doki plus Peter.

2722
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:22,770
Alright, get in here, Peter.

2723
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,110
Okay, get out.

2724
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:26,910
Get out.

2725
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:27,310
Get out.

2726
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:28,130
Get out.

2727
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:29,270
Yeah, that's not Peter.

2728
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:30,170
Peter, couldn't get in.

2729
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,010
Get out.

2730
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,450
Peter.

2731
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:32,270
Couldn't get in.

2732
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:33,070
All right, come over here.

2733
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:33,470
Where are you?

2734
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:35,850
I see.

2735
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:36,270
Okay, go.

2736
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:36,630
Go, go, go.

2737
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:37,870
Go, go, go.

2738
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:38,810
Get him.

2739
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:39,130
Get him.

2740
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:39,370
Get Peter!

2741
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:39,710
No!

2742
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,510
He says evil!

2743
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:41,610
Get out, get out, get out!

2744
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:42,410
I don't say evil!

2745
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:45,130
Let's go share.

2746
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:47,750
Go, go, go, go!

2747
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:48,470
Where's Peter?

2748
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:49,230
Wait, where's Peter?

2749
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:49,810
No!

2750
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:50,570
Where's Peter?

2751
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:50,890
No!

2752
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:51,590
Peter left!

2753
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,590
He left us!

2754
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:56,830
Peter left us!

2755
01:24:57,330 --> 01:24:57,690
No!

2756
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,330
Alright, Doki's only now.

2757
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:01,690
Yeah, Doki's only.

2758
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,370
Everyone else gets on shock attack.

2759
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:04,670
Okay, I couldn't get in.

2760
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:05,670
I don't think these guys are Doki's.

2761
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:07,470
I don't think these are Doki's either.

2762
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:10,110
Oh frick, I joined the game.

2763
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:10,630
Okay.

2764
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:12,810
Side quest.

2765
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:13,690
I got a side quest.

2766
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:15,730
You got a side quest.

2767
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,590
We left Peter.

2768
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:19,410
I'm so sad.

2769
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,110
We don't have Peter anymore.

2770
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:25,550
You are not Doki.

2771
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:27,910
We only want Doki.

2772
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:28,770
Wait, wait a second.

2773
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,210
Okay, you can stay.

2774
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:31,130
You can stay.

2775
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:34,910
I can't believe Peter left us.

2776
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:37,190
I know.

2777
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:39,110
I can't believe it.

2778
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:41,770
Someone said Peter too big and then he disconnected.

2779
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:43,050
Maybe he's changing his phone.

2780
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,910
Peter's too big.

2781
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:46,210
Peter too big.

2782
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:47,910
What the frick is this?

2783
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:48,950
Wait, where are you?

2784
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:49,850
Doki.

2785
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:51,730
Do you see this?

2786
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:52,270
Which one?

2787
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:53,490
Do you see this little head?

2788
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:55,610
Do you see this little head with my face on it?

2789
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:56,850
Where?

2790
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:57,970
I don't see it.

2791
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:58,410
On the floor!

2792
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:59,290
On the floor!

2793
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:02,990
Wait, I like this.

2794
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:03,710
I like the speeder.

2795
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,710
Wait, let's put this Doki with us.

2796
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:06,350
Alright, Doki's.

2797
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,790
Doki's get over here.

2798
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,950
Doki's.

2799
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,270
Only Doki's in the Doki verse.

2800
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:13,170
Okay, here, here, here.

2801
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:13,590
This one.

2802
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,410
Go, go, go, go, go.

2803
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:16,030
I couldn't even...

2804
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:16,390
Okay, wait.

2805
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:17,010
No, no.

2806
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:17,710
That's not...

2807
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:20,450
One of them is like Baku.

2808
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:21,610
Baku, go, go, go.

2809
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:24,230
Wait, I'm not in, I'm not in.

2810
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:28,190
I got out, but you said you're not in.

2811
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:30,490
They tried to go over again.

2812
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:31,310
Oh, there you are.

2813
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:32,290
You're in it right here.

2814
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:32,630
This one.

2815
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,350
Wait, they go in.

2816
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:34,850
Wait, wait a minute.

2817
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:36,230
Go, get out, get out.

2818
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:39,850
They go in when I sat near an elevator.

2819
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,490
Okay, we sat in the middle.

2820
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,410
Okay, we sat in the middle and then we find it.

2821
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:43,770
Okay, ready?

2822
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:44,910
Okay.

2823
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:45,430
Are you ready?

2824
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:47,950
You see the other bit I'm looking at?

2825
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:48,870
Yeah, I do.

2826
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:51,030
Wait, wait I'm going to open.

2827
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:52,870
Wait, how am I left?

2828
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:57,130
Peter's back.

2829
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:57,890
Peter.

2830
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,130
Peter, there's here.

2831
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:00,250
Oh my God!

2832
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:00,570
Oh my God!

2833
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:00,590
Okay.

2834
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:01,230
Okay what if...

2835
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:01,690
Hey, okay?

2836
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:04,270
Peter, Peter, Peter... Go, Peter, lead the way.

2837
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:05,150
Yeah, Peter, Peter!

2838
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:06,430
You go to the elevator!

2839
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:07,350
We follow you.

2840
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,230
Peter, you are a leader!

2841
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:14,430
No, you- go...ario we follow there!onne asked!

2842
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:17,370
Get out!

2843
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:19,290
Oh, wait, wait.

2844
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:19,630
Get out!

2845
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:20,650
Oh my God!

2846
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:28,130
I got up... I got up, doctor!

2847
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:31,990
What the fuck is Peter?

2848
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:33,730
Wait, he's here with Peter.

2849
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:36,370
No, no, I'm coming over.

2850
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:38,290
I'm coming over.

2851
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:41,470
Don't worry, back in the lobby.

2852
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:45,210
I think we need to create a private server.

2853
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:49,050
Oh my god, that was so funny.

2854
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:49,990
The fear.

2855
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:50,770
The fear.

2856
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,150
It was so real.

2857
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:55,550
We just want one thing.

2858
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:57,990
Women just want one thing.

2859
01:27:58,130 --> 01:27:59,810
Yes, Peter Griffin train.

2860
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:02,470
Peter Griffin has a train.

2861
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:08,170
I want it so badly.

2862
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:14,390
I'm trying to join the lobby, but I think the lobby is full.

2863
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:17,410
I can't just yell at me and say, Cheapy, you're gay.

2864
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:19,930
It's fake, I can't just... It's your lobby.

2865
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,890
Okay, okay, I'm gonna join a random doors lobby.

2866
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:27,550
You gotta join me because everybody is trying to get up, get into our lobby.

2867
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:28,990
We gotta go quick.

2868
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:30,190
Alright, alright, I'm in.

2869
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:31,230
Alright, I don't think...

2870
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:31,590
Okay, I'm joining you.

2871
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:33,470
Alright, okay, okay, I'm here.

2872
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:35,070
Oh my god, they're all waiting.

2873
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:36,170
They're all waiting.

2874
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:37,130
All these jokies.

2875
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,690
Peter, where's Peter?

2876
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:40,690
Peter, get your ass in here, Peter.

2877
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,670
Get your... Oh wait, there's normal Peter.

2878
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:45,450
No, I won't train Peter.

2879
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:46,550
No, he's not good enough.

2880
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:48,230
He's not good enough.

2881
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:49,050
Where are you?

2882
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,130
I see you, I see you, I see you.

2883
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:50,570
Okay, okay.

2884
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:51,030
Okay, okay.

2885
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,670
Let's pick a room, let's pick a room.

2886
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:54,790
Okay, let's just settle for jokies.

2887
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:55,930
Here, here, here.

2888
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,150
Okay.

2889
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:57,190
Okay.

2890
01:28:58,050 --> 01:28:58,850
Okay, that's a Doki.

2891
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:01,950
Wait, I think that was number one Doki bird fan.

2892
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:02,570
I think that's fine.

2893
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:04,470
Okay, oh my god, they're...

2894
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,170
They're not even a Doki!

2895
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:07,670
Okay, okay.

2896
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:13,430
We try one more time, one more time.

2897
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:15,130
Wait, this isn't good enough for you?

2898
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:16,450
Look, you have a cosplayer!

2899
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:18,330
No, look at the other ones!

2900
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:20,070
The other ones are just a regular name!

2901
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,130
What's their name?

2902
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:23,030
Zayn!

2903
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,930
What the fuck is that?

2904
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:27,210
I'm turning my mic on, I'm turning my mic on.

2905
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,410
Zayn disconnect.

2906
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:30,010
Disconnect, leave now.

2907
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:30,850
Disconnect Zayn.

2908
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:31,550
Leave now.

2909
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:32,650
Disconnect Zayn.

2910
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:33,210
Leave now.

2911
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:34,830
Get out of my life.

2912
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:35,070
Leave!

2913
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:36,090
Okay, nice.

2914
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,560
Did we sign

2915
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:58,460
him off?

2916
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,220
Oh no, we're gonna be his 13th reason!

2917
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,120
Jimmy, how did you turn it?

2918
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,380
Jimmy, that's so fucked up!

2919
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:07,380
Listen, listen, it's this kid's make-a-wish.

2920
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,780
You're gonna be the mad 13th reason!

2921
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,580
How would you live with yourself, Jimmy?

2922
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:15,320
Listen, skill-based matchmaking, little fucker.

2923
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,000
I was just joking.

2924
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,660
I was just joking, guys.

2925
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,120
Guys, it wasn't me.

2926
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:24,720
Slash J.

2927
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:27,200
This is their make-a-wish.

2928
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:27,980
To hang out with you.

2929
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:28,220
Yeah.

2930
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,060
So you need to make sure it's a good experience, okay?

2931
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:30,760
Yeah, yeah.

2932
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,260
I'll be the cameraman.

2933
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,220
I'll be the cameraman.

2934
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:33,940
You guys gotta like...

2935
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:35,980
Okay, you have to open every door first.

2936
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,100
You're the front line.

2937
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:37,980
Okay, Doki?

2938
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,480
You're the front line.

2939
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,080
Alright, open that door.

2940
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,380
Open- You're failing your first- Open the door!

2941
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,000
Open the door!

2942
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:46,920
Open the door!

2943
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:47,580
Open the door!

2944
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:54,840
Did you know if you say any bad words with Roblox chat, you get banned?

2945
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:55,760
Oh yeah, that's true.

2946
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,000
Yeah, oh my god.

2947
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:00,380
Someone was like, my experience with Doki, Google Doc.

2948
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:08,640
Dude, one time I was playing Dress To Impress, and I wanted like, to like, everyone to start over, so I said, everyone get naked.

2949
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,900
I got a 3 day pants.

2950
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:12,660
I got a 3 day pants!

2951
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,060
My God!

2952
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:17,600
Fair enough, seeing get naked in Roblox is not a good one.

2953
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:18,520
I'm like, I...

2954
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,500
Yeah, like, you know there are children in this...

2955
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:22,140
Fair enough!

2956
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,140
I'm bad!

2957
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:24,420
I've been like in the game!

2958
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,580
That makes it worse!

2959
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:27,420
What do you mean?

2960
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,160
It's a dress up game!

2961
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:30,560
It's a dress up game!

2962
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,180
It's a dress up game!

2963
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:32,240
Get naked...

2964
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:35,680
It's like, it's like when people were like, I hope you die in Minecraft.

2965
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:38,400
That's, listen!

2966
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,140
Listen, I've said that before!

2967
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,520
Take off your clothes in Minecraft.

2968
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:47,200
Okay, wait, that actually does sound really bad.

2969
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,180
Yeah, yeah!

2970
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:48,940
Yeah!

2971
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:50,540
And then, yeah!

2972
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:52,980
Oh frick.

2973
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:57,200
Yeah, and then it does sound really bad right now.

2974
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:58,840
What did I find?

2975
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,460
I got a battery.

2976
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:01,660
Oh, lick it.

2977
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,140
Lick it?

2978
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:03,580
Yeah.

2979
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,940
Which end do I lick?

2980
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:09,240
I think you can do both ends to make sure you're... make sure you get...

2981
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,160
Your body will take a screenshot.

2982
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,540
Oh, that's true.

2983
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,600
What the frick is that noise?

2984
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,280
What do you think it's that noise?

2985
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,140
Something's laughing.

2986
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,100
Do you frickin' hear that?

2987
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:20,600
What is that?

2988
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,420
Oh my god!

2989
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,760
That's a child.

2990
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:25,680
Wait, what?

2991
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:27,620
Oh my...

2992
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:29,520
What happened to me?

2993
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:31,240
It just bean dipped me and ran away.

2994
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:35,660
It ran at me in the closet.

2995
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:36,920
The frick was that.

2996
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:37,260
Wait, what?

2997
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:38,300
Look at that.

2998
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:40,500
Oh, it's the eye.

2999
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,900
Oh, there's an eye now, yeah?

3000
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,720
Yeah, it like took half your life, right?

3001
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,100
Yeah, it did.

3002
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,600
Yeah, how do you avoid it?

3003
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,440
I think that's the wrong way.

3004
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,660
I think that's the wrong way.

3005
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:56,680
Okay, Doki mod is not living... Doki mod is not doing what she was supposed to be doing.

3006
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:00,360
You will be shot to death if you do not get us from one...

3007
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:01,320
Thick!

3008
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:03,140
I'm almost dead.

3009
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:04,400
Me too.

3010
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,260
You will be executed if you do not.

3011
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:11,780
We will replace you with another Doki.

3012
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:15,320
The Doki Primes are angry right now.

3013
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:16,680
Yeah, we're mad.

3014
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:17,280
We're mad.

3015
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,020
I'm looking at you and I can't believe you're the...

3016
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:21,760
Oh, it's another eye.

3017
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,340
Two eyes in like, level 12?

3018
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:27,640
All right.

3019
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:30,020
Um...

3020
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,060
Doki, open that door.

3021
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:33,980
Nevermind.

3022
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:35,720
Okay.

3023
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:38,710
Yeah, he's okay.

3024
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:41,850
Doki, go towards that door right now.

3025
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:43,310
Which door?

3026
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:44,370
Right here.

3027
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,990
I like...

3028
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:47,650
Wait, did you told him you're replaceable?

3029
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:51,110
No, but I can tell him that if you want me to.

3030
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:51,570
Okay, yeah.

3031
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:53,010
Okay, do it.

3032
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:54,830
There's plenty of Doki's in this verse.

3033
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,390
Okay, hold on.

3034
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:57,850
Hey, listen in, motherfucker.

3035
01:33:58,370 --> 01:34:01,110
You iPod freaking cheeto dusted apple juice smear on the lips.

3036
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:01,650
Motherfucker.

3037
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:03,810
I have had kid playing Roblox on a Saturday night.

3038
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:05,810
You will be with VTubers too.

3039
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:09,010
We'll be VTubers we could buy your family, sell them and buy them again.

3040
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:10,010
Don't keep me head.

3041
01:34:10,130 --> 01:34:10,970
What the frick are you doing?

3042
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,050
You will lead us.

3043
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:14,210
Oh, I got banned.

3044
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:15,550
I got ban- I got warning.

3045
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:17,510
I got a warning for saying come to the end.

3046
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:23,310
We've detective language that Violet's Roblox created.

3047
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:27,390
Wait, you could have cursed him out in Espanol.

3048
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:30,330
I don't think the Roblox detection...

3049
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:31,030
Okay, hold up.

3050
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:33,050
Yeah, cursed him out in Espanol.

3051
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:34,310
Let's test it out.

3052
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,550
Okay, I'm gonna say one thing, okay?

3053
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:36,190
Yeah.

3054
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:38,830
No, say many things, so then we'll...

3055
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:42,730
Alright, now... I didn't get a ban.

3056
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:43,450
I didn't get a ban.

3057
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:44,730
Yeah, alright, go off on him.

3058
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:45,330
Do it.

3059
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:47,830
Pendeja caliente pinche puto.

3060
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:49,010
Yeah, that's right.

3061
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:49,450
Yeah!

3062
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:50,650
Yeah!

3063
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:50,970
Yeah!

3064
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:52,710
Say some more stuff.

3065
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:56,470
Chibi, you will get banned.

3066
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:56,990
Oh, oh.

3067
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:57,910
No, no, say more.

3068
01:34:58,230 --> 01:34:58,630
No, you won't.

3069
01:34:58,710 --> 01:34:59,230
You'll be...

3070
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:09,590
I can't even click out of it.

3071
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:10,910
I can't even click out of it.

3072
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:12,350
Why the fuck did you listen to me?

3073
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:13,770
Are you...

3074
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:15,530
I got banned!

3075
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:17,450
I got banned!

3076
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:18,170
I got hip popping up!

3077
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:22,670
I can't believe...

3078
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:25,650
Chibi got banned in Roblox.

3079
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,310
It's sad.

3080
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:34,410
It's not the first time I was playing Roblox Squid Games, and that game pisses me off so much, because the kids piss me off and start yelling.

3081
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:34,930
Yeah.

3082
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:36,290
And we do not like that.

3083
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:39,510
Hello, little guy.

3084
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:42,070
Oh, oh.

3085
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:42,790
Whoa.

3086
01:35:42,930 --> 01:35:43,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3087
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:44,730
Don't worry, we're in that room.

3088
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:48,830
Wait, what's that?

3089
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:51,950
Goodbye, DokiFan.

3090
01:35:52,190 --> 01:35:53,390
Goodbye, DokiFan.

3091
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:57,110
Wait, is he good?

3092
01:35:57,390 --> 01:35:58,010
Oh, he's good.

3093
01:35:58,010 --> 01:35:58,890
Yeah, he's good, he's good.

3094
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:02,750
Good night, sweet child.

3095
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:04,610
Fish.

3096
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:08,490
Nice, why did he go under the bed?

3097
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:10,070
I think he's scared of you.

3098
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,150
He's nervous, you know?

3099
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:14,230
He's so nervous, yeah.

3100
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:15,950
He's got the full outfit and everything.

3101
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:17,430
Yeah.

3102
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:20,470
It's like his dream to get yelled at by the Doki's.

3103
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:21,070
Doki Square.

3104
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:21,550
Wait, wait, wait.

3105
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:22,130
I can't...

3106
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:23,910
Doki, pick a room.

3107
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:24,930
Pick a door, right now.

3108
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:25,830
Doki.

3109
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:28,610
Doki, stop going to drawers.

3110
01:36:29,370 --> 01:36:29,810
Pick a door.

3111
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:32,810
You can't talk to him, you got a bad room.

3112
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:36,370
Open it.

3113
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:40,530
Oh my god, they took it!

3114
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:41,450
He's dead!

3115
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:44,390
Alright, revive yourself.

3116
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:45,450
Alright, this way.

3117
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:45,810
Alright, goodbye.

3118
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:00,260
You're stupid.

3119
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:01,600
You're so...

3120
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,040
You're so stupid.

3121
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,420
You'll fucking revive yourself.

3122
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,220
I gifted you a fucking revive.

3123
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:08,900
Yo, easy 30 robux.

3124
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:13,240
That's karma right there.

3125
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,000
That's actual karma.

3126
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,760
I'd like to apologize to Doki Bird fan.

3127
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,440
I don't.

3128
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,240
I live.

3129
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,560
Zero consequences.

3130
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,120
Not there yet.

3131
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,280
Not there yet.

3132
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:37,300
Nice.

3133
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:38,780
Look at that.

3134
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:39,620
Okay, so...

3135
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:39,960
Let's go.

3136
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,460
Oh, it's this way.

3137
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:43,660
Alright.

3138
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:44,900
What?

3139
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:49,660
There's a spider on me, be careful.

3140
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:50,700
Oh no.

3141
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,180
If you get too close to me, I'm gonna get Ligma.

3142
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:54,960
What's Ligma?

3143
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:02,840
I found it, I found it.

3144
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,380
On this.

3145
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:07,200
Boom.

3146
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,160
Yay!

3147
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:10,120
Alright, follow the door.

3148
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:10,600
Alright, choose the door.

3149
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:11,300
No, oh.

3150
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:11,800
This way.

3151
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:12,140
What?

3152
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:12,840
Choose the door.

3153
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:13,320
Oh.

3154
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,300
You're so lucky.

3155
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:17,060
You're so lucky.

3156
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:18,660
I was like...

3157
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:20,600
Alright.

3158
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:21,960
Oh, we're almost there.

3159
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,760
And the next one is the running one.

3160
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:26,020
Oh, it is.

3161
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:26,540
Oh, it is.

3162
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:26,840
It is.

3163
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,180
I really hope we see DokiFan make it to the end.

3164
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,760
I'd be so sad if he doesn't knock through the door.

3165
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:32,580
Yeah.

3166
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:35,360
He's so freaking sad.

3167
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,690
I'm ready.

3168
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:53,250
I went the wrong way.

3169
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:53,590
Oh, wait.

3170
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:53,790
Straight.

3171
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:54,050
Okay.

3172
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:56,030
What?

3173
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:56,550
You're a pro.

3174
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,970
Just follow the voices.

3175
01:38:58,170 --> 01:38:58,690
Let them win.

3176
01:38:59,090 --> 01:38:59,370
Straight again.

3177
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:00,050
What do the voices say?

3178
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:01,330
What do the voices say?

3179
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:02,510
Straight.

3180
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:03,210
Okay.

3181
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:04,390
I got it.

3182
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:06,270
I'm doing it.

3183
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:07,070
I'm doing it.

3184
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:08,390
She's locking in.

3185
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:08,690
She's pressing field.

3186
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:09,610
I'm so locking in.

3187
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:11,370
I'm going left and right.

3188
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:13,150
It's like this game is made for children.

3189
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:13,850
Oh my god.

3190
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:15,550
Dokimon made it too.

3191
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:17,870
They did it.

3192
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,490
What a Chad.

3193
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:19,970
Okay.

3194
01:39:20,030 --> 01:39:21,010
That was actually impressive.

3195
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:21,750
Dokifan.

3196
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:22,850
Yeah, you did it.

3197
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:24,330
Nice.

3198
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:27,510
Alright.

3199
01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:29,770
Oh.

3200
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:30,730
Is there items here?

3201
01:39:30,730 --> 01:39:31,250
No.

3202
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:32,270
Oh.

3203
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:33,650
I found some piss.

3204
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:34,090
Oh, wait, wait.

3205
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:35,490
Oh, wait.

3206
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:36,150
Can you drop it?

3207
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:37,490
How do you drop items?

3208
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:38,570
Oh, here, here.

3209
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:39,110
I can drop it.

3210
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:39,490
Okay.

3211
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:39,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3212
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:41,250
Cause you're full HP cause you died.

3213
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:42,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3214
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:43,330
Here.

3215
01:39:44,410 --> 01:39:45,110
Freaking rap.

3216
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:46,650
Drinking, drinking piss in the van.

3217
01:39:46,970 --> 01:39:47,410
Like, what the frick?

3218
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:50,490
That's how I like it.

3219
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:51,250
Yeah.

3220
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:52,210
Is your guilt.

3221
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:53,730
Oh, it said door open.

3222
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:54,350
Oh, they did it.

3223
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:55,010
Nice, Dokifan.

3224
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:55,450
You did it.

3225
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:57,590
You're making all us Dokifans proud.

3226
01:39:58,490 --> 01:39:59,070
I know.

3227
01:40:00,730 --> 01:40:02,090
See, this is why we have you around.

3228
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:06,810
And why we did- Why we did cyberbullying off the game.

3229
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:07,850
Like the other guy.

3230
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:08,070
Well, I will.

3231
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:08,670
I will.

3232
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:11,410
Only if they perform adequately.

3233
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:12,710
Otherwise, they're gone.

3234
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:13,730
They're fucking gone.

3235
01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:15,990
The thirteenth reason will be you.

3236
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:17,830
I'll get more than a three day van.

3237
01:40:23,690 --> 01:40:24,590
Are you good?

3238
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:29,940
I'm ready for- Alright.

3239
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:32,080
Are you ready to spend your Robux?

3240
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,660
Are you- Oh, frick!

3241
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:35,320
I'm not- You know you're lucky.

3242
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,100
Spend your Robux.

3243
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:37,620
Where's that?

3244
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:38,820
Where's that?

3245
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:40,620
Where's that?

3246
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:41,600
Where's that?

3247
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:42,940
Where's that?

3248
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:43,700
Where's that?

3249
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:44,500
Spend your Robux.

3250
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:46,240
Come on!

3251
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:46,880
Did they do it?

3252
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:47,840
Are you good?

3253
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:49,300
Wait, what the frick?

3254
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:50,880
What the frick?

3255
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:51,480
Wait, are you good?

3256
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:53,100
Are you rest?

3257
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,260
What is that?

3258
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:56,340
Is that you?

3259
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:02,750
What the frick?

3260
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:03,010
What is that?

3261
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:04,250
Are you okay?

3262
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:07,410
Were you alive?

3263
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:08,090
Who was that?

3264
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:09,230
Are you alive?

3265
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:11,970
I'm under the water.

3266
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:13,530
I'm dropping.

3267
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:15,130
You died!

3268
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:18,970
You actually died!

3269
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:21,510
Oh my god!

3270
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:25,470
I'll just let you know, Chibi, I've been rest and I'm ahead of you guys.

3271
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:31,050
I was... I was ahead of you guys in the room.

3272
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:35,790
I'm meaning this not to be edgy or offended.

3273
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:37,650
But you're effectively turning me straight.

3274
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:39,610
And it's just a disrespect.

3275
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:40,230
Wait, you both died.

3276
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:41,510
You both died!

3277
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:44,110
The disrespect for woman is insane.

3278
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:48,810
I'm changing my preference on Tinder.

3279
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:52,830
You both died.

3280
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:55,210
Oh my...

3281
01:41:58,880 --> 01:41:59,740
No, walk in, walk in.

3282
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:00,520
Are you okay?

3283
01:42:05,690 --> 01:42:08,550
I can't believe you both died.

3284
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:12,790
I... This is so freaking disrespectful.

3285
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:13,570
That's actual karma.

3286
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:13,870
That's karma.

3287
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:17,530
And by the way, I was asking my audience for like, uh, dirt on you.

3288
01:42:17,550 --> 01:42:20,890
I could yell at you whenever you laugh at me for being stupid because I knew it would happen.

3289
01:42:20,990 --> 01:42:23,790
And all they had to say was you're a Marvel rival, you're an Overwatch fan.

3290
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,810
And I was like, but the frick, that's all she's got on her?

3291
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:26,710
God dang it.

3292
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:29,510
You see it, Chibi.

3293
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:38,370
When I was growing up, I didn't eat... I didn't eat salt or... Or licked batteries growing up.

3294
01:42:39,870 --> 01:42:41,030
There's always tomorrow.

3295
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:42,350
What, tomorrow?

3296
01:42:42,510 --> 01:42:47,570
I'm just gonna start licking some... Dude, do a mukbang stream where you just eat salt and like, licked batteries.

3297
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:50,930
That's weird.

3298
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:56,070
I heard like, I actually heard it, but... But it didn't show up.

3299
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:58,890
Ooh, that's weird.

3300
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:02,650
Dokimon just said, Chibi, this is your fault for cyberbullying.

3301
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:05,150
I'm about to... Shut up.

3302
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:08,470
This is your... Shut up.

3303
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:09,730
You're not gonna... You're gonna... Shut up.

3304
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:12,150
You're gonna... Don't lie.

3305
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:13,530
Psst.

3306
01:43:14,950 --> 01:43:15,670
Don't give a hat.

3307
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:15,950
Don't give a hat.

3308
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:20,770
What's your Twitch username?

3309
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:28,690
I didn't know what number we were at.

3310
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:31,410
What's your... Prick.

3311
01:43:31,590 --> 01:43:32,630
What's your IGN?

3312
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:43,430
Where am I?

3313
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:48,680
I'm trying to ban him.

3314
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,040
It's...

3315
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:51,820
Shibidoki and... Are you... Are you... Are you trying to ban him?

3316
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,060
Tell the world your plans.

3317
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:57,540
He said his username is Shibidoki.

3318
01:43:57,620 --> 01:43:58,520
That is not freaking true.

3319
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:58,880
Alright.

3320
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:03,460
We realize this Doki might not be the right Doki for this... For this game.

3321
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,160
But you have Thomas.

3322
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:05,920
You're never alone.

3323
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:07,160
That's true.

3324
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:07,560
Psst.

3325
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:10,680
That's so true.

3326
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:13,100
At least Thomas will be here for me.

3327
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:13,960
Oh, there's a flashlight on that desk.

3328
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,760
I don't need a flashlight.

3329
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:17,020
Oh my god.

3330
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:17,540
She's hurt.

3331
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:18,100
I'm... I'm hurt.

3332
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:18,620
She's go keep hurting.

3333
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:19,380
I'm gaming.

3334
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,980
I think this is about to be play of the game.

3335
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:26,760
Alright.

3336
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:27,340
Okay.

3337
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,040
I swear to god.

3338
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:31,040
If you get this done really quickly, I'm gonna be so freaking pissed off at myself.

3339
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:31,580
Alright.

3340
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:32,600
How many gifted subs?

3341
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:33,960
On my channel.

3342
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,620
Not on Shibid's channel.

3343
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:38,200
On my channel, like a hundred gifted maybe.

3344
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:39,420
Keep it, you know, humble.

3345
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:40,920
Yeah.

3346
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:41,920
Just a hundred, you know.

3347
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:43,740
Just... Just a low hundred.

3348
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,300
Are you good at stealth games?

3349
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:47,780
No.

3350
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:52,000
You literally... You literally saw me die like immediately.

3351
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,440
You've got this.

3352
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:55,360
Do I?

3353
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:57,460
I don't know.

3354
01:44:57,620 --> 01:44:59,260
I just, you know, want it to like make you feel good.

3355
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:00,740
You know, like cheer you on a little.

3356
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:01,580
Oh, nice.

3357
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:02,580
That's cool.

3358
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,360
I didn't really need it, but...

3359
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:06,320
Wait.

3360
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:07,280
Where are they?

3361
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:09,460
Where are the codes?

3362
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:12,320
They make little glitter noises like...

3363
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,180
Where is it?

3364
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,920
Oh, I got money though.

3365
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:23,460
Where the fuck are they?

3366
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:27,160
Let her cook, shh.

3367
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:28,260
I'm cooking, I'm cooking.

3368
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:32,060
Jessie, stop touching my balls.

3369
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:32,860
What?

3370
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,260
I can't, Mr. White.

3371
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:35,520
It feels really good.

3372
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:39,200
Where the fuck?

3373
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,140
Sorry, that was just a bonus episode of Breaking Bad.

3374
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:43,020
Yeah, I never watched Breaking Bad.

3375
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:44,560
It's pretty good.

3376
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:49,020
I watched like the first episode and I got so depressed because the guy got cancer.

3377
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:51,320
Yeah, actually that show...

3378
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:53,240
No, it's actually really sad.

3379
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:53,940
Yeah.

3380
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:54,740
It is.

3381
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,820
The first episode made me too depressed.

3382
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,180
And I was like, I can't do that.

3383
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:02,140
Well, like 10 years ago I read a spoiler that...

3384
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:05,380
I read online that Walter got cancer.

3385
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,220
And I thought that was a spoiler for the show.

3386
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,160
So I was so pissed off I didn't watch it for 10 years.

3387
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,580
And then I finally sat down and watched it.

3388
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:15,460
And I was like, wait, that's not even a spoiler.

3389
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,780
I can't believe he got cancer.

3390
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,500
I can't watch this anymore.

3391
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,620
Well, cause I thought that was like the big twist.

3392
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,220
Remember to check your prostate.

3393
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,300
No one starts with cancer.

3394
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,100
That's why he became a drug lord.

3395
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:31,220
Yeah.

3396
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,100
That's his whole shtick.

3397
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,900
Okay, why did you think he became a drug lord if it wasn't for cancer?

3398
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:38,800
I didn't know anything about the show.

3399
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:39,540
I didn't even...

3400
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:41,800
Like, I literally only knew that he was bald.

3401
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:43,460
So I just ate and had cancer.

3402
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:44,140
That's all I knew.

3403
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:46,540
What's this?

3404
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:47,620
Okay, I need...

3405
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:49,180
Sir, I need...

3406
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:50,660
Star, square, triangle.

3407
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:51,680
Okay.

3408
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:54,640
Where are the books?

3409
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:55,940
Where are the books?

3410
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,640
Mr. White, what do the books say?

3411
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,500
They go, they sparkle like...

3412
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:02,320
I hear it too.

3413
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:03,440
Oh, here you go.

3414
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:05,760
Okay, we need two more.

3415
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:06,760
Or one more.

3416
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:10,460
Okay, it has to be up front.

3417
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,360
Cause I...

3418
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,100
I looked at all of them here.

3419
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:15,140
She's cooking.

3420
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:18,100
I'm cooking right now.

3421
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:22,630
Oh, that's so creepy.

3422
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:24,170
I'm still cooking.

3423
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:30,430
Oh, I found another...

3424
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:32,810
Looks like you're like muffling Thomas' face in the door.

3425
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:34,590
Like your curb stomping him.

3426
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:35,890
Is that okay?

3427
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:36,270
Cool.

3428
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:37,590
Alright, there you go.

3429
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:39,030
It's...

3430
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:40,110
Okay, it's...

3431
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:41,130
Three...

3432
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:42,370
Six...

3433
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:43,530
Three...

3434
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:43,770
Six...

3435
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:44,390
Six...

3436
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:44,490
Two.

3437
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:45,270
Okay, three...

3438
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:45,570
six...

3439
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:45,690
Two.

3440
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:00,650
Okay.

3441
01:48:00,650 --> 01:48:01,470
Is this guy blind?

3442
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:06,450
Is he blind or something?

3443
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:08,390
Now you know how I felt!

3444
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:10,910
Now you know how I felt!

3445
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:14,650
Oh wait, he actually is blind?

3446
01:48:14,970 --> 01:48:16,110
Yeah he is!

3447
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:19,490
Did you try one?

3448
01:48:19,870 --> 01:48:22,670
Yes, that's the first one I did.

3449
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,730
That is actually the first one.

3450
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:29,450
You tried to?

3451
01:48:29,810 --> 01:48:31,630
I did that already, don't worry.

3452
01:48:31,910 --> 01:48:32,150
Oh frick.

3453
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:35,910
I'm going up by...

3454
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:38,110
3, 6, 6...

3455
01:48:38,110 --> 01:48:39,110
2...

3456
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:41,050
There we go.

3457
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:43,670
Okay, chat, who did it faster?

3458
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:44,790
One for me, two for...

3459
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:46,850
Okay, who do you think did faster?

3460
01:48:47,150 --> 01:48:48,490
Who do you think?

3461
01:48:48,690 --> 01:48:51,090
The one that put 7 twice?

3462
01:48:51,470 --> 01:48:55,370
And I wanted to put it in as the third time?

3463
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:58,530
And then I was like, Jimmy, why do you want to put...

3464
01:48:58,530 --> 01:48:59,450
put in...

3465
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:00,590
7 again?

3466
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:04,450
Because baby it was 7.

3467
01:49:07,710 --> 01:49:09,770
TokiFPS VTuber YouTube TT.

3468
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:14,590
Oh my god.

3469
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:14,970
Oh my god.

3470
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:18,410
This guy is taking fucking forever to get here.

3471
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:19,690
Holy shit.

3472
01:49:20,030 --> 01:49:22,550
God, the way Thomas just looks out the closet.

3473
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:25,610
Alright, where's my 100 gifted memberships?

3474
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:26,290
On my YouTube.

3475
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:27,790
Alright, TokiFan.

3476
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:28,350
Get on that.

3477
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:29,670
TokiFan.

3478
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:30,670
Alright, Tokis.

3479
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:31,070
Come on.

3480
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:32,290
Where's my 100 gifted?

3481
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:33,430
That was...

3482
01:49:36,050 --> 01:49:38,510
Literally carrying the Tokis on my back right now.

3483
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:40,890
You actually are.

3484
01:49:40,990 --> 01:49:42,170
This is like natural selection.

3485
01:49:42,770 --> 01:49:43,410
Do you think...

3486
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:45,570
Do you think I should go where it says humans?

3487
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:47,850
I think that's the store.

3488
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:48,630
I think it's okay.

3489
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:49,410
This way, humans.

3490
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:50,830
Humans.

3491
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:52,610
Welcome to the underground.

3492
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:56,370
Show us your balls.

3493
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:56,910
Show us your balls.

3494
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:58,810
Oh.

3495
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:01,610
Oh look, it's the freaking lone wolf.

3496
01:50:02,490 --> 01:50:02,930
Humans.

3497
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:04,850
Humans.

3498
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:06,450
Hey!

3499
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:07,590
Oi!

3500
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:08,650
Oh!

3501
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:09,530
Careful of the tentacles.

3502
01:50:10,110 --> 01:50:10,490
Alright.

3503
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:11,910
I have the key.

3504
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:13,430
I have a flashlight.

3505
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:14,130
I have a cross.

3506
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:15,130
What does a cross do?

3507
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:17,130
Um.

3508
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:19,530
Maybe it like keeps you alive or something.

3509
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:20,890
That's what it does in like phasmophobia.

3510
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:21,370
Oh.

3511
01:50:21,570 --> 01:50:22,290
Wait, I don't have enough.

3512
01:50:22,650 --> 01:50:23,190
I only have four.

3513
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:29,210
I'm not spending my money on you guys.

3514
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:31,150
That's not...

3515
01:50:31,150 --> 01:50:31,430
Understood.

3516
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:33,950
I get it.

3517
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:34,790
I get it.

3518
01:50:34,890 --> 01:50:35,830
It's not the first step.

3519
01:50:35,930 --> 01:50:36,370
No, it's fine.

3520
01:50:36,530 --> 01:50:37,430
I understand.

3521
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:38,290
Listen.

3522
01:50:38,430 --> 01:50:38,630
Listen.

3523
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:39,850
Women be shopping.

3524
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:40,550
I get it.

3525
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:43,970
Alright.

3526
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:44,410
Where's...

3527
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:44,890
Oh, there's the key.

3528
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:45,470
Nice.

3529
01:50:46,550 --> 01:50:46,970
Nice.

3530
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:47,510
Nice car.

3531
01:50:48,910 --> 01:50:49,770
What did you say?

3532
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:50,770
What?

3533
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:51,590
I said nice job.

3534
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:52,610
Oh.

3535
01:50:52,910 --> 01:50:53,350
I heard...

3536
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:54,770
I heard something completely different.

3537
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:55,530
Wait, what did you hear?

3538
01:50:56,730 --> 01:50:57,670
I can't say it.

3539
01:50:57,850 --> 01:50:58,150
Oh, no.

3540
01:50:58,190 --> 01:50:58,730
What did you hear?

3541
01:51:00,030 --> 01:51:01,270
I heard you say...

3542
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:02,450
I can't say it out of the word.

3543
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:02,790
No, no.

3544
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:03,830
What did you hear?

3545
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:04,510
Wait, what?

3546
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:06,130
What did you hear, Chibi?

3547
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,020
Chibi, what did you think I said?

3548
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:13,640
Chibi?

3549
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:18,640
Come on, Chibi.

3550
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:19,100
Come on.

3551
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:19,720
What was it?

3552
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:22,940
Here, instead I will perform as a gesture and entertain you while you...

3553
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:23,600
Here we are, Chibi.

3554
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:30,440
I will entertain you.

3555
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:31,520
No, Chibi, no.

3556
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:32,900
What did you think I said?

3557
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:34,120
I'm actually curious.

3558
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:35,080
What's this?

3559
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,320
I'm actually curious.

3560
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:37,440
What did you think?

3561
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:39,820
Your reaction was like, what the fuck?

3562
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:44,890
Oh, I prefer...

3563
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:45,650
Okay, give me a hint.

3564
01:51:45,790 --> 01:51:46,670
Give me a hint, Chibi.

3565
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:47,390
It...

3566
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:49,250
It rhymes with...

3567
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:49,470
Flock.

3568
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:51,790
What?

3569
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:54,750
I thought you said nice.

3570
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,450
Beep.

3571
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:56,850
Nice...

3572
01:51:56,850 --> 01:51:56,970
What?

3573
01:51:58,590 --> 01:52:00,750
You know, nice, um...

3574
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:02,770
Sock.

3575
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:05,050
What's wrong with that?

3576
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:09,770
No, but like, it was a different word that sounds like similar.

3577
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:11,770
So what was it?

3578
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:23,640
What?

3579
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:26,840
A male chicken.

3580
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:29,720
Rooster?

3581
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:31,500
Teeth?

3582
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,120
Oh, seven?

3583
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:33,560
No, the frickin' slurp.

3584
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:35,640
Jesus, you slurp so loud.

3585
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:37,600
Whoa, that's weird to say.

3586
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:45,420
Say it.

3587
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,460
What's wrong with saying it?

3588
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,020
I don't understand.

3589
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:48,200
Nice phallus.

3590
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:51,480
Nice phallus.

3591
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:52,680
That's what you thought you said.

3592
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,480
Blink, a different word for it.

3593
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:59,420
Blink, what's a different word?

3594
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:00,940
I can't...

3595
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:03,340
Blink, maybe I'll say it on Roblox chat.

3596
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:08,860
Should I spell it?

3597
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:10,380
Okay, yeah, I spell it.

3598
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:11,460
I'm confused.

3599
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:13,780
C-O-C-K.

3600
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:18,940
What is that word?

3601
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:20,100
I thought you said that!

3602
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:21,320
Because I did.

3603
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:34,880
It was a prank saduko with my eyes closed.

3604
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:35,880
Like, none of it mattered.

3605
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:37,880
None of it mattered.

3606
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:42,620
Watch out, there's a shark in there.

3607
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,240
Got him.

3608
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:56,720
It was very believable, wasn't it?

3609
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:01,120
I genuinely thought you didn't know what that word was.

3610
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,200
Yeah, you actually was, like, trying to teach me.

3611
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:11,360
I felt really smart.

3612
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:12,860
I was like, nice, I know something.

3613
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:14,400
I'm so intelligent.

3614
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:19,880
Nice.

3615
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:21,380
Nice rock.

3616
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:24,540
Nice rock.

3617
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:26,580
Nice rock.

3618
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:27,820
Nice rock.

3619
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:28,980
Nice rock.

3620
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:34,240
Oh, which room is it?

3621
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:36,240
What room?

3622
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:37,020
Pick a room.

3623
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:37,800
Any room.

3624
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Why did I just pick this room?

3625
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:43,840
I don't know.

3626
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:44,740
What's there?

3627
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:45,580
I heard feet.

3628
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:46,720
Nice.

3629
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:50,700
Nice stock.

3630
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:52,340
Nice rock.

3631
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Nice rock.

3632
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:00,100
I can't tell that light was, like, because sometimes they do, like, fake lights.

3633
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,820
For the monsters.

3634
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:02,940
So I can't tell.

3635
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:04,040
Okay, 64.

3636
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:04,820
Alright.

3637
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:05,720
Dokimon.

3638
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:07,440
Was it 64 or 63?

3639
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:08,980
It's 64.

3640
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:08,980
Trust.

3641
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,780
This is your time to shine.

3642
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:11,280
Okay, I said Dokimon.

3643
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:13,840
Sorry, I speak what's wrong with you.

3644
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:14,160
My bad.

3645
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:17,100
Why do you speak for him?

3646
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:18,760
Right?

3647
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:19,320
Okay.

3648
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:19,840
Wait.

3649
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:21,300
My right or your right?

3650
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,720
Okay, 64 or 63?

3651
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:26,820
Tokimon.

3652
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:28,160
69.

3653
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:28,960
Alright.

3654
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:30,440
See, I told you.

3655
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:31,260
I never lied to you.

3656
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:36,280
Wait, is that the... monster light or...

3657
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,460
Yeah.

3658
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:38,320
Yup, yup.

3659
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:42,760
How's this?

3660
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:44,320
Alright.

3661
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,320
Now we're in the painting room.

3662
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:48,260
Wait, this is our PD almost.

3663
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:50,320
Peanut butter.

3664
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:51,740
Nice.

3665
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,100
Alright.

3666
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,760
I know we swapped these two.

3667
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,180
Where am I in the Doki food chain?

3668
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:01,400
Because I... I'm, like, an honorary Doki.

3669
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,640
My name is Chibi, but my last name is Doki.

3670
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:06,140
So, like, am I, like, up there?

3671
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,840
Do I... do I have any respect?

3672
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,580
I feel...

3673
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:11,340
Oh, that's... that's cute.

3674
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:13,260
What?

3675
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:13,340
What?

3676
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:19,280
Do I have... like, like, do people look at me in the eyes when they speak to me?

3677
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,780
Or do they chuck, like, hammers at me?

3678
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:22,460
Like...

3679
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:22,740
It's like a spectrum.

3680
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:24,340
You're like... okay, you're like...

3681
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:28,020
Okay, you wanna know where you are in the Doki food chain?

3682
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:29,000
Yeah.

3683
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:29,740
You're like...

3684
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:32,260
You know when, like, you know, they're like...

3685
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,520
You're like, Chibi Doki entertain us.

3686
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:36,420
And then...

3687
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:37,800
You're the tiny little jester.

3688
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:41,580
And then Jax is in front of all the Doki's.

3689
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:42,380
You're the...

3690
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:45,020
Did I start busting it down?

3691
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:45,680
No, we just...

3692
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:46,180
You know the most...

3693
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:48,020
Saddest thing part.

3694
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:49,580
No, you know, like, that breakdance...

3695
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:50,720
Is it breakdancing Garfield?

3696
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:51,660
Like...

3697
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:52,680
Oh, yes!

3698
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:53,620
Break.

3699
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:54,720
Yeah.

3700
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:59,320
When I was a kid, my mom convinced me that I was really good at the robot.

3701
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:01,680
So, every family function for, like, 10 years.

3702
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:02,640
You just do the robot.

3703
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:04,600
They would surround me and go...

3704
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,300
Like, watch a white girl catch a groove, bro.

3705
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:08,220
I would be busting down the robot.

3706
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:09,000
And...

3707
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,840
One time I was dancing in the kitchen.

3708
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:11,200
Hey, wait.

3709
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,180
Before you go on the story.

3710
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:13,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3711
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,460
I beat you.

3712
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:20,980
Nice.

3713
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:22,660
Nice sock.

3714
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:24,000
Nice sock.

3715
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:24,940
Look at that.

3716
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:26,740
You're in a creepy room.

3717
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,380
I'm in a creepy room.

3718
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,580
But anyways, long story short, I'll keep it short.

3719
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,900
I was busting it down, white girl style, in the kitchen.

3720
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:35,860
And my mom ran in from the patio.

3721
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:37,360
Cause she thought I was having a seizure.

3722
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:38,020
And...

3723
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,380
That's how bad I am at dancing.

3724
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,960
Like, when I twerk, it looks like I'm a mosquito drinking blood.

3725
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:44,580
It's bad.

3726
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,040
Oh, where do these doors go?

3727
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,420
Where does this door go?

3728
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,080
Wait, so they didn't call the hospital?

3729
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:55,180
Well, she was on the phone and came running in.

3730
01:57:55,180 --> 01:57:56,260
And she thought I was seizing.

3731
01:57:56,260 --> 01:57:57,460
And she thought I was seizing.

3732
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,200
And she thought I was seizing.

3733
01:57:58,200 --> 01:57:59,700
She thought I was seizing.

3734
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,980
But no, I was just busting it.

3735
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:05,440
Oh, I know I'm running past the wall by the door.

3736
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,980
I was checking the items out.

3737
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:10,540
So you're like...

3738
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:11,420
So we basically...

3739
01:58:11,420 --> 01:58:13,080
If the other Doki's wanna be entertained...

3740
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:15,380
Um...

3741
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:16,040
We like...

3742
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:17,440
What we do...

3743
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:17,940
Yeah?

3744
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,560
Is basically, we're like, bring in the entertainment.

3745
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:22,040
And then we like, pick you up.

3746
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:24,580
And then just drop you into the center of the circle.

3747
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:26,180
Surrounded by all the Doki's.

3748
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:28,000
And we just watch you break down.

3749
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,740
Why aren't you dancing your banana outfit?

3750
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:36,320
Roll out the chibi.

3751
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:38,880
I'm like the freaking Scrappy Doo of the group.

3752
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:40,020
Oh, you are!

3753
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:40,860
That is like...

3754
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:41,420
Oh my god.

3755
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:43,400
That is the perfect example.

3756
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:46,620
That's actually...

3757
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:47,400
Oh.

3758
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:48,480
Wait, how do I do this?

3759
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:50,160
I don't know.

3760
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:51,960
I actually don't know.

3761
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:55,480
I don't know.

3762
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:56,660
That's kind of scary.

3763
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:59,640
He's like jumping in the distance watching you.

3764
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:00,180
We can't see that.

3765
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,240
I don't know how to do this.

3766
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:05,980
I...

3767
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:06,900
I don't know.

3768
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:10,350
I'm so confused.

3769
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:12,590
I'm actually...

3770
01:59:12,590 --> 01:59:14,650
I am so confused.

3771
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:15,750
I am so confused.

3772
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:17,570
She just falls over.

3773
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:18,810
I guess...

3774
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:20,090
I don't know.

3775
01:59:20,430 --> 01:59:21,610
I can't read.

3776
01:59:23,790 --> 01:59:25,670
That was like actual cinema.

3777
01:59:26,150 --> 01:59:26,770
I can't read it.

3778
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:27,710
That was beautiful.

3779
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:31,430
Alright, we go to the lobby.

3780
01:59:32,110 --> 01:59:34,470
We need another doki.

3781
01:59:34,930 --> 01:59:35,890
We need another victim.

3782
01:59:36,050 --> 01:59:36,990
Where's Peter Train?

3783
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:39,610
Fina.

3784
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:40,910
Fina, the horse is here.

3785
01:59:42,930 --> 01:59:43,990
He's like a cat.

3786
01:59:44,150 --> 01:59:45,050
Oh my god, Lois.

3787
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:46,870
That reminds me...

3788
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:47,810
You remember?

3789
01:59:48,170 --> 01:59:48,810
From the time?

3790
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:52,150
Did all the doki's die in doors?

3791
01:59:54,490 --> 01:59:55,770
Holy crap, Lois.

3792
01:59:55,890 --> 01:59:57,010
What the frick are you?

3793
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:58,430
Wait a second!

3794
01:59:58,790 --> 02:00:01,550
Why does this person have a better chibi doki model than I have?

3795
02:00:01,710 --> 02:00:05,430
Yeah, this is... Can we have... Can we invite this chibi doki?

3796
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:10,410
Okay, let's get... Wait, I thought you were banned.

3797
02:00:10,770 --> 02:00:11,670
How are you unbanned?

3798
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:14,290
Oh no, wait, am I unbanned?

3799
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:15,510
Yeah, you're talking.

3800
02:00:17,130 --> 02:00:17,610
Oh.

3801
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:19,350
I see like the microphone.

3802
02:00:20,630 --> 02:00:21,110
Hey.

3803
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:22,690
Oh my god.

3804
02:00:22,830 --> 02:00:23,990
I like your outfit.

3805
02:00:24,190 --> 02:00:24,350
Hey.

3806
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:26,510
Are you rizzing yourself?

3807
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:27,070
Hey.

3808
02:00:27,110 --> 02:00:28,010
Would you...

3809
02:00:28,010 --> 02:00:31,470
Okay, if there was another chibi doki, would you like...

3810
02:00:32,170 --> 02:00:35,210
You know, take your chibi doki to home run?

3811
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:39,730
No, because that would be so pathetic that like that's...

3812
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:42,810
That is the situation that I would only ever get that far, number one.

3813
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:45,310
And number two, God, I have freaking standards.

3814
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:46,770
I know the way I am.

3815
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:48,150
No, absolutely not.

3816
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:48,830
I'd like...

3817
02:00:48,830 --> 02:00:50,210
Absolutely freaking not.

3818
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:52,570
So someone else has to lower their standards to...

3819
02:00:52,570 --> 02:00:52,850
Yes.

3820
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:53,670
Absolutely.

3821
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:55,250
It's like...

3822
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:57,910
Satan is playing limbo with the freaking bar.

3823
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:59,330
So, so...

3824
02:00:59,330 --> 02:01:01,770
Yeah, they have to lower their standards.

3825
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:06,530
To go past first phase.

3826
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:12,950
Wait, if someone else is willing to lower their standards, why aren't you willing to lower your own standards?

3827
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:14,390
For my...

3828
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:14,470
For my...

3829
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:15,350
Well, okay.

3830
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:16,970
Because, listen, I...

3831
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:19,850
If I was with myself, that would be the worst...

3832
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:20,510
That guy is...

3833
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:21,030
Sorry, Ducky.

3834
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:22,690
Do you see Ducky running on this guy?

3835
02:01:22,930 --> 02:01:23,330
Yeah.

3836
02:01:23,770 --> 02:01:24,570
I'm giving him a lap dance.

3837
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:25,430
I...

3838
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:31,790
Dude, if I lowered my standards for myself, that would be such a bad relationship because I don't clean or anything.

3839
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:32,370
Oh, yeah.

3840
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:33,170
Who would be the cleaner?

3841
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:34,650
I know.

3842
02:01:34,790 --> 02:01:35,070
It'd be bad.

3843
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:35,590
Oh, my God.

3844
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:37,590
Wait, are we one?

3845
02:01:37,730 --> 02:01:39,010
Wait, look at Doki for...

3846
02:01:39,010 --> 02:01:39,730
Do you see this?

3847
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:40,350
Oh, Doki.

3848
02:01:40,470 --> 02:01:40,870
Okay, yeah.

3849
02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:42,010
Okay, get over here.

3850
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:42,950
We need that Doki.

3851
02:01:43,150 --> 02:01:43,890
Get over here.

3852
02:01:43,890 --> 02:01:44,390
You're the chosen one.

3853
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:45,010

Wait.

3861
02:01:53,170 --> 02:01:54,190
We need to...

3862
02:01:54,190 --> 02:01:54,730
These three.

3863
02:01:54,990 --> 02:01:55,490
These two.

3864
02:01:55,890 --> 02:01:56,870
Okay, Aubrey Doki.

3865
02:01:57,150 --> 02:01:57,830
Follow us.

3866
02:01:57,930 --> 02:01:58,930
Doki stroky.

3867
02:02:00,570 --> 02:02:01,050
Okay.

3868
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:01,570
Alright.

3869
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:02,210

Come here.

3872
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:05,990
Come here.

3873
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:06,510
Are you ready?

3874
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:07,070
Are you ready?

3875
02:02:07,210 --> 02:02:07,410
Come here.

3876
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:08,910
Alright.

3877
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:09,370
This one.

3878
02:02:13,290 --> 02:02:15,130
Okay, come on, get out, get out, get out.

3879
02:02:15,190 --> 02:02:15,410
Right here.

3880
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:18,270
Right here, right here, ready?

3881
02:02:18,510 --> 02:02:18,890
Okay, here.

3882
02:02:19,630 --> 02:02:20,130
Go, go, go!

3883
02:02:21,010 --> 02:02:24,170
Hey, hey, hey!

3884
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:28,390
Wait, you pick a room.

3885
02:02:28,530 --> 02:02:29,250
This one, this one!

3886
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:33,730
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

3887
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:34,530
Get in!

3888
02:02:34,650 --> 02:02:35,590
Why aren't you in?!

3889
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:37,650
I told you wanted the dookies!

3890
02:02:38,190 --> 02:02:40,130
That was one of the dookies!

3891
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:42,090
Oh, I told you wanted all the dookies.

3892
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:43,730
Oh my god.

3893
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:45,710
I'm leaving.

3894
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:47,110
I'm coming back to your lobby.

3895
02:02:47,530 --> 02:02:48,110
I'm coming.

3896
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,770
Hey.

3897
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:50,270
Uh I...

3898
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:51,390
Okay.

3899
02:02:51,730 --> 02:02:52,030
Okay.

3900
02:02:52,270 --> 02:02:52,590
Okay.

3901
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:52,910
Pick.

3902
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:53,630
Okay I'm here.

3903
02:02:53,730 --> 02:02:53,910
I'm here.

3904
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:54,250
Pick a room.

3905
02:02:54,270 --> 02:02:55,390
What the frick is this?

3906
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:56,010
Pick a room.

3907
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:57,470
Oh, okay.

3908
02:02:57,530 --> 02:02:57,630
Okay.

3909
02:02:58,090 --> 02:02:58,490
This one!

3910
02:02:58,570 --> 02:02:58,810
This one!

3911
02:02:59,910 --> 02:03:00,310
Okay.

3912
02:03:01,030 --> 02:03:02,090
Oh my god okay.

3913
02:03:02,210 --> 02:03:02,770
You've gotta try.

3914
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:03,430
You have to try again.

3915
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:04,010
You have to try again.

3916
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:04,650
Okay.

3917
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:07,390
One of the jokies has... What's it called?

3918
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:08,570
Chikawa, hummermermer.

3919
02:03:08,590 --> 02:03:09,210
Got it.

3920
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:09,850
Okay, okay, okay.

3921
02:03:10,350 --> 02:03:10,670
Ready?

3922
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:11,170
Pick another.

3923
02:03:11,370 --> 02:03:11,590
Pick another.

3924
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:12,110
This one.

3925
02:03:12,210 --> 02:03:12,310
This one.

3926
02:03:14,650 --> 02:03:14,970
Alright.

3927
02:03:15,730 --> 02:03:16,290
Good or no?

3928
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:16,790
Yeah, good.

3929
02:03:16,930 --> 02:03:17,210
It's fine.

3930
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:17,730
That's fine.

3931
02:03:18,310 --> 02:03:18,730
Oh, who's that?

3932
02:03:18,810 --> 02:03:19,570
Okay, I don't know.

3933
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:20,270
I don't know.

3934
02:03:20,550 --> 02:03:21,110
I don't care what's it.

3935
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:21,830
I want to play with these two.

3936
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:22,370
Alright, don't worry.

3937
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:22,870
We can end up.

3938
02:03:23,070 --> 02:03:23,190
Okay.

3939
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:23,690
Nice.

3940
02:03:23,870 --> 02:03:24,930
We got the Dokis.

3941
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:25,950
It's a Dokis squad.

3942
02:03:26,090 --> 02:03:26,890
It's a full Dokis.

3943
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:28,170
We're good.

3944
02:03:28,290 --> 02:03:28,550
We're good.

3945
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:29,590
We're good.

3946
02:03:29,790 --> 02:03:29,990
We're good.

3947
02:03:30,150 --> 02:03:34,330
We have... We have Aubrey Dokis.

3948
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:35,710
Yay, your favorite.

3949
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:36,490
It's the medic.

3950
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:38,450
It's the medic from Team Fortress 2.

3951
02:03:38,470 --> 02:03:39,830
Wait, this person, they're saying hi to us.

3952
02:03:40,290 --> 02:03:40,690
Hello.

3953
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:43,090
Alright, we have all the Dokis.

3954
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:43,610
This is it.

3955
02:03:43,790 --> 02:03:44,330
This is it.

3956
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:45,530
We're gonna hit 100.

3957
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:48,450
100.

3958
02:03:48,690 --> 02:03:49,570
100 doors.

3959
02:03:50,130 --> 02:03:50,810
We got this.

3960
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:52,870
Sorry, I had to establish myself as the Alpha.

3961
02:03:53,030 --> 02:03:53,890
The Alpha Dokie?

3962
02:03:54,370 --> 02:03:54,650
Yeah.

3963
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:55,110
Yeah, yeah.

3964
02:03:55,370 --> 02:03:57,010
Yeah, the Dokie Prime.

3965
02:03:57,110 --> 02:03:58,150
We are the Dokie Primes.

3966
02:03:58,270 --> 02:03:59,150
What we say is law.

3967
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:01,310
Oh, my God.

3968
02:04:01,490 --> 02:04:02,690
This is a pay-to-win Dokie.

3969
02:04:02,770 --> 02:04:04,270
They bought extra items for us.

3970
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:06,250
I want it.

3971
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:06,630
Give me.

3972
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:07,250
Give me.

3973
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:08,750
What is this?

3974
02:04:09,270 --> 02:04:09,930
Lead the way.

3975
02:04:10,150 --> 02:04:10,790
I don't know what it is.

3976
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:10,950
I don't know.

3977
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:11,630
Oh, my God.

3978
02:04:11,770 --> 02:04:11,930
Look.

3979
02:04:11,930 --> 02:04:12,950
She bought so much stuff for it.

3980
02:04:12,970 --> 02:04:13,170
Look, look.

3981
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:13,890
There's another one.

3982
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:15,170
Drink it.

3983
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:15,750
Oh, my God.

3984
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:16,170
Okay.

3985
02:04:16,330 --> 02:04:16,610
Drink it.

3986
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:18,210
What does it do?

3987
02:04:18,830 --> 02:04:19,230
Whoa.

3988
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:21,110
Does it make you faster?

3989
02:04:21,970 --> 02:04:23,490
I don't know what the frick that is.

3990
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:25,870
I don't even know what it does.

3991
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:29,150
Oh, that felt good.

3992
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:31,630
I don't know what that was, but it felt good.

3993
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:33,470
What is it?

3994
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:35,010
We're getting lit, like I said.

3995
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:35,830
Oh, it's health.

3996
02:04:36,070 --> 02:04:36,470
What?

3997
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:38,270
That was health.

3998
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:41,990
And she was like, please use it only in emergency.

3999
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:43,670
And we chugged it.

4000
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:49,310
Use only in emergency.

4001
02:04:49,730 --> 02:04:52,570
And that was... I don't think the Dokie understand.

4002
02:04:52,630 --> 02:04:54,630
It was an emergency.

4003
02:04:56,170 --> 02:04:57,230
So I was really thirsty.

4004
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:59,150
Yeah, we were so thirsty.

4005
02:05:02,110 --> 02:05:05,090
It was probably like 10,000 freaking coins.

4006
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:07,610
You got to go.

4007
02:05:07,730 --> 02:05:08,670
You got to go.

4008
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:12,210
Dokie, where's the keys?

4009
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:13,210
Okay, go away.

4010
02:05:13,330 --> 02:05:14,690
Why are we doing work, Dokie?

4011
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:15,550
Get over here.

4012
02:05:15,850 --> 02:05:16,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4013
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:17,310
Let's sit over here and commentate.

4014
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:18,230
We're the entertainers.

4015
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:19,310
Yeah, yeah, we're the entertainers here.

4016
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:21,070
Let's drink our piss and watch these peasants.

4017
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:21,650
Oh, yeah.

4018
02:05:22,170 --> 02:05:23,170
Are you drinking again?

4019
02:05:25,030 --> 02:05:26,090
I have no problem.

4020
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:27,050
Shut up, my uncle.

4021
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:30,250
We're sorry.

4022
02:05:31,810 --> 02:05:33,390
This Dokie has a problem.

4023
02:05:33,670 --> 02:05:34,850
Has a drinking problem.

4024
02:05:37,690 --> 02:05:39,030
Did you use it all up?

4025
02:05:40,990 --> 02:05:41,390
Chibi?

4026
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:42,870
Wait.

4027
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:43,930
Wait.

4028
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:46,910
This person's saying that this guy died.

4029
02:05:47,130 --> 02:05:47,510
Wait, really?

4030
02:05:47,810 --> 02:05:47,950
Wait, what?

4031
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:50,130
Oh, oh, they said they died.

4032
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:51,010
They said they died.

4033
02:05:51,150 --> 02:05:51,530
I don't know.

4034
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:52,230
Wait, what?

4035
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:56,010
I think he had it with us drinking the...

4036
02:05:58,010 --> 02:05:59,570
You don't sound like a club-yard boy.

4037
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:00,850
I think it's because...

4038
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:01,310
Have a good day.

4039
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:03,470
I think it's because we kept drinking...

4040
02:06:04,110 --> 02:06:07,270
We kept drinking his items that he left us.

4041
02:06:07,730 --> 02:06:08,370
He's had enough.

4042
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:08,590
Oh, wait.

4043
02:06:08,750 --> 02:06:10,550
Do we cyber-book another fucking camp?

4044
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:14,470
Okay, we need to be really nice to this Dokie.

4045
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:15,590
Because this is like...

4046
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:16,210
This is crowd...

4047
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:16,670
No, no.

4048
02:06:16,690 --> 02:06:17,590
This is a stress test.

4049
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:19,130
We're stress testing the Dokies.

4050
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:21,670
If they can't handle us...

4051
02:06:21,670 --> 02:06:24,650
If they can't handle us, they were not meant to be a Dokie.

4052
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:26,210
They revoked their Dokie card.

4053
02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:28,270
Yeah, they have to change their cosplay.

4054
02:06:29,610 --> 02:06:30,670
Yeah, they have to change it.

4055
02:06:33,570 --> 02:06:35,090
This Dokie is screaming.

4056
02:06:35,770 --> 02:06:36,210
You're scared.

4057
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:41,530
Why are you scared, Dokie?

4058
02:06:41,630 --> 02:06:42,090
Come on.

4059
02:06:42,650 --> 02:06:42,970
Do we work?

4060
02:06:43,090 --> 02:06:43,530
Yeah, keep up.

4061
02:06:43,670 --> 02:06:45,170
Come on, keep up, Dokie.

4062
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:46,710
This is our third attempt.

4063
02:06:47,810 --> 02:06:49,070
Get your ass over here.

4064
02:06:49,090 --> 02:06:50,850
I can hear my voice in their mic.

4065
02:06:53,330 --> 02:06:54,330
I hear it.

4066
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:55,970
I hear the voices, Ma.

4067
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:56,790
My ears.

4068
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:00,890
They're so cute.

4069
02:07:01,930 --> 02:07:02,230
Alright.

4070
02:07:03,910 --> 02:07:04,550
There it is.

4071
02:07:05,990 --> 02:07:06,150
Alright.

4072
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:07,830
Wait, they're so...

4073
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:08,610
Where are they?

4074
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:09,450
Where did they go?

4075
02:07:10,150 --> 02:07:11,130
Wait, where did...

4076
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:12,290
We lost our Dokie.

4077
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:15,610
I don't know, but the last thing I heard them say was...

4078
02:07:15,610 --> 02:07:17,490
I sound like a 12-year-old boy, but I'm actually a girl.

4079
02:07:17,490 --> 02:07:17,890
I swear.

4080
02:07:22,430 --> 02:07:23,290
I've been there, dude.

4081
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:27,230
It's like, child or female.

4082
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:28,970
Oh my god, dude.

4083
02:07:30,130 --> 02:07:30,830
Oh my god, I had...

4084
02:07:30,830 --> 02:07:31,430
I'm clearly a female.

4085
02:07:31,890 --> 02:07:33,030
I had a game.

4086
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:34,430
Do you remember Dark and Darker?

4087
02:07:35,150 --> 02:07:35,510
Yes.

4088
02:07:35,870 --> 02:07:38,230
Okay, so there was a time I was playing Dark and Darker.

4089
02:07:38,430 --> 02:07:40,150
And then I was talking, like...

4090
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:43,490
You know, the best part about Dark and Darker is when you get to talk to the random strangers.

4091
02:07:43,490 --> 02:07:46,450
And then, so I bumped into this guy.

4092
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:47,950
And then...

4093
02:07:47,950 --> 02:07:49,130
This train...

4094
02:07:49,130 --> 02:07:49,870
I swear to God.

4095
02:07:50,550 --> 02:07:51,190
I swear to God.

4096
02:07:51,570 --> 02:07:54,050
Wait, our Dokie is sobbing in a closet.

4097
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:56,130
I just heard her going...

4098
02:07:56,130 --> 02:07:57,070
I'm dead.

4099
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:57,830
I'm...

4100
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:00,610
I'm...

4101
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:05,510
I'm gonna talk to Dokie, number three.

4102
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:06,790
Hey, do you have any Robux?

4103
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:07,350
I'm dead.

4104
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:07,530
I'm dead.

4105
02:08:07,530 --> 02:08:07,930
I'm dead.

4106
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:08,650
I'm dead.

4107
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:16,630
I'm dead.

4108
02:08:21,170 --> 02:08:21,810
I'm dead.

4109
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:23,270
I'm dead.

4110
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:23,710
I'm dead.

4111
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:24,130
I'm dead.

4112
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:24,630
I'm dead.

4113
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:24,930
I'm dead.

4114
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:25,350
I'm dead.

4115
02:08:25,350 --> 02:08:25,690
I'm dead.

4116
02:08:25,690 --> 02:08:26,070
I'm dead.

4117
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:27,170
I'm dead.

4118
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:27,630
I'm dead.

4119
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:28,710
I'm dead.

4120
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:29,370
I'm dead.

4121
02:08:31,790 --> 02:08:32,990
I'm dead.

4122
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:33,610
financially.

4123
02:08:33,730 --> 02:08:35,910
Wait, DokiFPS declined your revive.

4124
02:08:36,590 --> 02:08:38,090
Where's my revive?

4125
02:08:39,690 --> 02:08:41,210
What do you mean?

4126
02:08:42,370 --> 02:08:43,590
Go through the rooms.

4127
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:44,710
Go through the rooms.

4128
02:08:46,710 --> 02:08:48,250
What do you mean?

4129
02:08:49,570 --> 02:08:54,110
It says, DokiFPS, VTuber, YouTube, TTV, Facebook denied your revive.

4130
02:08:54,550 --> 02:08:56,650
I was waiting for your revive.

4131
02:08:58,330 --> 02:08:59,270
Okay, listen.

4132
02:08:59,610 --> 02:09:00,730
We need to lock in.

4133
02:09:01,790 --> 02:09:02,590
What's up?

4134
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:07,610
Alright, I guess it's time.

4135
02:09:12,230 --> 02:09:12,870
Okay, yeah.

4136
02:09:13,070 --> 02:09:13,470
I'll keep it.

4137
02:09:13,490 --> 02:09:14,030
I'll keep it on.

4138
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:14,490
I'll keep it on.

4139
02:09:14,650 --> 02:09:15,950
Alright, I'm in the room ahead.

4140
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:16,830
I'm here.

4141
02:09:17,030 --> 02:09:18,290
Oh, did you rest yourself?

4142
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:20,190
I rest myself, you fuckers.

4143
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:21,470
I rest.

4144
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:23,630
You said it.

4145
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:24,530
You said it.

4146
02:09:24,630 --> 02:09:26,350
Don't let her revive you.

4147
02:09:26,510 --> 02:09:27,290
I was like, okay.

4148
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:32,510
And then I declined her revive so I can accept your revive.

4149
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:34,170
Listen, listen.

4150
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:35,510
I got freaking nervous.

4151
02:09:35,890 --> 02:09:36,770
I'm listening, okay?

4152
02:09:37,550 --> 02:09:37,890
Wait, wait.

4153
02:09:37,970 --> 02:09:38,510
I got you something.

4154
02:09:39,030 --> 02:09:39,170
Eh?

4155
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:41,870
Okay, don't fucking waste a flashlight.

4156
02:09:42,170 --> 02:09:43,130
We're literally in...

4157
02:09:43,130 --> 02:09:44,610
We're in room 18.

4158
02:09:44,850 --> 02:09:46,630
I got you a sample of my piss.

4159
02:09:46,970 --> 02:09:46,990
Okay.

4160
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:50,190
People spend... Can I have that back?

4161
02:09:52,990 --> 02:09:54,370
Don't, don't, don't give it to her.

4162
02:09:54,890 --> 02:09:55,750
You're in Doki.

4163
02:09:56,310 --> 02:09:57,190
You're in Doki.

4164
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:58,670
Doki, drop the item.

4165
02:09:58,830 --> 02:09:59,930
Doki, drop the item.

4166
02:10:00,330 --> 02:10:02,490
Doki, drop the item.

4167
02:10:02,710 --> 02:10:02,970
Doki.

4168
02:10:02,970 --> 02:10:04,210
I have a faster internet.

4169
02:10:05,210 --> 02:10:06,470
She's saying, drop it.

4170
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:08,470
I, I, but it's like a dog with chocolate.

4171
02:10:08,690 --> 02:10:09,290
I don't think you want to have that.

4172
02:10:09,290 --> 02:10:09,950
I did, I dropped it.

4173
02:10:10,490 --> 02:10:11,150
I dropped it.

4174
02:10:13,010 --> 02:10:13,670
I dropped it.

4175
02:10:13,670 --> 02:10:15,590
She said, how do I drop it and then drank it.

4176
02:10:18,770 --> 02:10:20,390
She went, how do I drop it?

4177
02:10:29,310 --> 02:10:30,010
Go, go.

4178
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:30,770
Open the doors.

4179
02:10:30,930 --> 02:10:31,450
Open the doors.

4180
02:10:31,650 --> 02:10:31,830
Go.

4181
02:10:31,830 --> 02:10:32,430
Go.

4182
02:10:32,790 --> 02:10:33,350
Go.

4183
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:33,950
Go.

4184
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:34,330
Go.

4185
02:10:34,330 --> 02:10:34,410
Go.

4186
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:35,050
Go far away.

4187
02:10:35,470 --> 02:10:36,530
Doki, go for it.

4188
02:10:36,570 --> 02:10:36,930
You clearly...

4189
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:40,890
She said she feels like you're bullying her.

4190
02:10:41,470 --> 02:10:43,790
Go far away.

4191
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:46,930
Doki Bird says, go far away.

4192
02:10:48,650 --> 02:10:49,990
Go, go far away.

4193
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:52,510
Go.

4194
02:10:53,590 --> 02:10:54,850
You will be executed.

4195
02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:55,150
Take it.

4196
02:11:00,070 --> 02:11:02,870
We will passage you from the Doki first.

4197
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:07,990
We will delete you from our existence if you don't go for it.

4198
02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:10,170
They will take you.

4199
02:11:10,510 --> 02:11:10,670
They will take you.

4200
02:11:11,110 --> 02:11:12,690
They will take you.

4201
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:13,830
They will...

4202
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:15,490
You will be taken to Rumble.

4203
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:16,550
No more...

4204
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:16,730
Ah!

4205
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:25,210
We're actually bullying me.

4206
02:11:25,630 --> 02:11:26,810
That was me.

4207
02:11:27,650 --> 02:11:28,820
We're so freaking...

4208
02:11:30,790 --> 02:11:32,550
In every universe.

4209
02:11:33,510 --> 02:11:36,430
In every universe, Doki bullies a child.

4210
02:11:38,910 --> 02:11:40,230
There's always...

4211
02:11:40,230 --> 02:11:41,470
No, no, no.

4212
02:11:41,530 --> 02:11:42,570
You don't sound like a child.

4213
02:11:43,010 --> 02:11:44,570
There's always one Doki...

4214
02:11:46,030 --> 02:11:48,170
One Doki in the lowest food chain.

4215
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:49,890
Oh, here.

4216
02:11:50,730 --> 02:11:51,530
Doki the third.

4217
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:52,310
Doki the third.

4218
02:11:52,870 --> 02:11:53,530
I bestow a...

4219
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:54,310
Where the frick did you go?

4220
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:55,250
Where the frick did you go?

4221
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:55,650
I'm here.

4222
02:11:56,670 --> 02:11:57,490
Oh, fuck.

4223
02:11:58,550 --> 02:11:59,450
Here, I give the...

4224
02:11:59,450 --> 02:12:00,770
Here, you can have that if you can't see.

4225
02:12:01,090 --> 02:12:01,670
There you go.

4226
02:12:01,770 --> 02:12:02,950
There you go.

4227
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:05,590
What the...

4228
02:12:05,590 --> 02:12:05,890
Did you...

4229
02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:08,670
They turned on their flashlight, looked at me and said, Ew, I'm done.

4230
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:09,470
I can't...

4231
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:10,810
The frick is wrong with the...

4232
02:12:10,810 --> 02:12:11,430
Wait, are you good?

4233
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:12,470
Are you good?

4234
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:13,630
Did she leave?

4235
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:16,990
Wait, I have a...

4236
02:12:16,990 --> 02:12:17,990
Wait, where's the key?

4237
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:19,370
Hello?

4238
02:12:21,730 --> 02:12:22,310
Hello?

4239
02:12:23,090 --> 02:12:23,730
Are you good?

4240
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:24,830
What?

4241
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:25,450
What happened?

4242
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:30,400
What happened?

4243
02:12:31,980 --> 02:12:32,960
Where are you?

4244
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:35,100
Wait, I'm making a friend one second.

4245
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:37,700
So I continue...

4246
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:38,080
Speak.

4247
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:40,140
Speak.

4248
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:45,240
I've lost track of them.

4249
02:12:45,420 --> 02:12:46,580
I have no idea where they went.

4250
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,860
Why is Doki society so cruel?

4251
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,120
It's a Doki Doki world.

4252
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,120
Bob Ryan.

4253
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:06,140
What the fuck are you guys doing?

4254
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:06,920
Wait, wait.

4255
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:07,760
Doki Bird.

4256
02:13:07,860 --> 02:13:08,620
I'm not even kidding.

4257
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:10,260
This person was being really sweet.

4258
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:11,400
Saying some really nice stuff to me.

4259
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:13,160
They got a freaking warning from Roblox.

4260
02:13:13,420 --> 02:13:14,880
From being nice to me.

4261
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:16,180
They got a warning in Roblox.

4262
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:17,800
They said, I love what you do.

4263
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:19,760
And then they got a freaking warning.

4264
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:21,840
They're like, you can't love.

4265
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:23,660
You can't love here.

4266
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:25,260
No love is allowed.

4267
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:29,020
Doki Bird, where are you?

4268
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:32,880
I guess we'll never know.

4269
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:34,940
Where is Doki Bird?

4270
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:38,180
Get in the closet.

4271
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:42,080
Love is forbidden here.

4272
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:42,940
Wait, are you...

4273
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:44,720
Are you good?

4274
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:45,960
Yeah.

4275
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:49,880
Doki Bird.

4276
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:50,720
Yeah?

4277
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:52,460
Our fan is dead.

4278
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:53,820
No, no, don't worry.

4279
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:55,700
She revived in front of me.

4280
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:02,850
I'm partially responsible except in the closet.

4281
02:14:03,030 --> 02:14:03,630
What did you do?

4282
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:04,590
You took her closet?

4283
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:07,270
After she told you how much she loves you.

4284
02:14:07,390 --> 02:14:09,670
After she told you how much she loves you.

4285
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:11,910
And what you do, you took her closet.

4286
02:14:12,230 --> 02:14:14,390
This is truly a Doki Doki world.

4287
02:14:14,830 --> 02:14:15,450
This is...

4288
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:16,090
Shit!

4289
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:19,050
This is truly...

4290
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:20,210
Sorry, I'm talking to her again.

4291
02:14:20,730 --> 02:14:22,650
A Doki Doki world.

4292
02:14:22,830 --> 02:14:24,830
It doesn't matter how much love you give them.

4293
02:14:26,330 --> 02:14:28,150
They'll take everything from you.

4294
02:14:28,630 --> 02:14:29,810
It's survival of the Doki.

4295
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:30,550
Yeah.

4296
02:14:32,510 --> 02:14:34,790
You're the lowest Doki in the food chain.

4297
02:14:35,010 --> 02:14:35,650
You deserve it.

4298
02:14:35,650 --> 02:14:37,150
You are the algae of this world.

4299
02:14:37,330 --> 02:14:38,170
We will consume you.

4300
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:40,010
You are the lowest food chain.

4301
02:14:40,150 --> 02:14:40,470
You are the lowest food chain.

4302
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:41,890
The lowest...

4303
02:14:41,890 --> 02:14:43,870
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

4304
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:46,850
I got the key.

4305
02:14:47,390 --> 02:14:47,950
Oh, nice!

4306
02:14:49,790 --> 02:14:56,810
Bro, that other Doki we had, I think that other Doki was honestly the better Doki out of all of us for this game.

4307
02:14:56,810 --> 02:14:58,590
I think they would have carried us.

4308
02:14:58,690 --> 02:14:59,330
And then they left.

4309
02:14:59,330 --> 02:15:00,530
Oh yeah, the one who bought us the loot?

4310
02:15:00,810 --> 02:15:04,290
Yeah, and then they left after you kept drinking the thing.

4311
02:15:05,310 --> 02:15:05,850
Listen.

4312
02:15:06,470 --> 02:15:07,010
Listen.

4313
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:08,150
They said they gave up.

4314
02:15:08,590 --> 02:15:11,150
They knew after two doors they gave up.

4315
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:12,770
They freaking left.

4316
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:14,950
Oh.

4317
02:15:16,050 --> 02:15:16,370
Oh.

4318
02:15:16,490 --> 02:15:17,910
Yeah, this is where we get chased, I think.

4319
02:15:18,050 --> 02:15:18,970
Yeah, we can just do this.

4320
02:15:19,170 --> 02:15:19,330
Here.

4321
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:20,010
Here.

4322
02:15:20,190 --> 02:15:23,710
Take these pills and use them whenever they chase you so you'll go fast.

4323
02:15:24,230 --> 02:15:24,610
Yeah, yeah.

4324
02:15:24,610 --> 02:15:26,070
Oh wait, guys.

4325
02:15:26,090 --> 02:15:26,690
Guys!

4326
02:15:27,610 --> 02:15:28,250
GUYS!

4327
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:29,570
GUYS!

4328
02:15:29,570 --> 02:15:29,610
GUYS!

4329
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:30,310
We're dead.

4330
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:40,960
I was freaking wrong.

4331
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:43,380
I was so wrong.

4332
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:44,840
I thought it was the other guy.

4333
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:46,480
I thought it was too.

4334
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,560
Didn't we all die?

4335
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:49,220
Yes.

4336
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:52,280
We all use the reds.

4337
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:53,200
Wait, Chibi, no.

4338
02:15:53,260 --> 02:15:54,060
You have one more reds.

4339
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:55,760
You have one more reds.

4340
02:15:55,880 --> 02:15:56,020
You...

4341
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:57,280
You will...

4342
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:58,060
You shall...

4343
02:15:58,060 --> 02:15:58,740
Good evening!

4344
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:01,260
I will lead us to Ufri Piss.

4345
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:02,980
Alright, I'll save this when I really need it.

4346
02:16:04,340 --> 02:16:05,460
Did you save it?

4347
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:07,680
Then...

4348
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,200
Did you save it, Chibi?

4349
02:16:09,880 --> 02:16:10,400
Did you?

4350
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:13,220
I'm lagging.

4351
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:17,300
Dude, I feel so smart at this puzzle for you guys.

4352
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:20,820
Alright, I got this, boys.

4353
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:25,120
Don't even worry about it.

4354
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:25,920
Easy frickin' game.

4355
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:26,800
I'm so worried.

4356
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:28,420
I'm so worried.

4357
02:16:28,980 --> 02:16:29,460
Nah.

4358
02:16:31,940 --> 02:16:32,420
Ooh.

4359
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:36,660
Slurp.

4360
02:16:37,380 --> 02:16:37,760
Alright.

4361
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:38,980
Let's speedrun.

4362
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:40,620
Pretty easy game, so I'll be real quick.

4363
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,200
Yeah, it's like this game is made for children or something.

4364
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:47,460
Shut the frick up.

4365
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:49,340
I'm in my element.

4366
02:16:50,060 --> 02:16:51,520
But can you be my personal best?

4367
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:53,780
Oh, what was it?

4368
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:54,680
It was like 70 something?

4369
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:56,600
It was 70, yeah.

4370
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,880
I got to 69 and then died at 70.

4371
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:01,240
I got...

4372
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:03,580
Voice chat suspended for five frickin' minutes.

4373
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:04,880
What the frick did I say?

4374
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:05,600
What the frick did I say?

4375
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:06,160
What did you say?

4376
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:07,380
What did I say?

4377
02:17:07,560 --> 02:17:08,120
Was it the birth?

4378
02:17:10,820 --> 02:17:12,320
What the frick did I say?

4379
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:20,910
I think I've only died to like...

4380
02:17:20,910 --> 02:17:21,890
Those fucking...

4381
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:22,510
The chasers.

4382
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:24,110
I know!

4383
02:17:24,950 --> 02:17:26,190
They are bullshit.

4384
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:27,210
They are so bullshit.

4385
02:17:27,510 --> 02:17:27,690
Debs...

4386
02:17:27,690 --> 02:17:29,050
Debs, please nerf them.

4387
02:17:29,090 --> 02:17:29,730
Please nerf.

4388
02:17:30,190 --> 02:17:33,370
Um, they're clearly too strong for this game.

4389
02:17:34,230 --> 02:17:35,570
Like, um...

4390
02:17:35,570 --> 02:17:36,090
It makes...

4391
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:37,350
My inner...

4392
02:17:37,350 --> 02:17:38,890
It makes my child cry.

4393
02:17:39,190 --> 02:17:39,570
Hello?

4394
02:17:40,890 --> 02:17:41,930
Why are you crying?

4395
02:17:41,930 --> 02:17:42,650
My child...

4396
02:17:42,650 --> 02:17:42,970
No, you.

4397
02:17:43,270 --> 02:17:43,590
You're my...

4398
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:44,450
Your child.

4399
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:46,870
How frickin' dare you?

4400
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:49,950
I am the sole survivor of the Doki army.

4401
02:17:52,830 --> 02:17:54,750
I'm a frickin' national hero.

4402
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:56,390
Look.

4403
02:17:56,770 --> 02:17:57,250
Look.

4404
02:17:58,230 --> 02:18:00,970
I don't even need to see which one because I know it's this one.

4405
02:18:01,310 --> 02:18:01,570
Boom.

4406
02:18:01,710 --> 02:18:02,930
You need to be at this...

4407
02:18:02,930 --> 02:18:05,450
At least this height to talk back to...

4408
02:18:12,030 --> 02:18:13,890
You're gonna drive me to frickin' drink.

4409
02:18:16,210 --> 02:18:17,110
Oh, that...

4410
02:18:17,770 --> 02:18:18,570
You weren't drinking earlier?

4411
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:19,570
Even Aubrey Doki.

4412
02:18:19,790 --> 02:18:22,750
Aubrey Doki said you're the sole survivor because everyone left you.

4413
02:18:24,330 --> 02:18:24,850
Maybe...

4414
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:26,830
You're at the bottom of the Doki chain.

4415
02:18:27,090 --> 02:18:30,470
Look, you're getting Aubrey Doki to cyber bully you right now.

4416
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:32,650
Don't!

4417
02:18:32,710 --> 02:18:33,830
I can't hear you over the...

4418
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:34,250
Boom!

4419
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:34,730
Boom!

4420
02:18:36,110 --> 02:18:36,490
Boom!

4421
02:18:37,190 --> 02:18:37,410
Boom!

4422
02:18:38,090 --> 02:18:38,330
Boom!

4423
02:18:38,330 --> 02:18:38,490
Boom!

4424
02:18:39,590 --> 02:18:40,110
Boom!

4425
02:18:45,230 --> 02:18:46,150
It's like a cat.

4426
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:46,510
It said...

4427
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:46,950
Heat in my ear.

4428
02:18:47,050 --> 02:18:47,530
You guys hear that?

4429
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:48,550
Meow.

4430
02:18:48,970 --> 02:18:49,490
Meow.

4431
02:18:50,630 --> 02:18:51,150
Meow.

4432
02:18:51,570 --> 02:18:51,850
Meow.

4433
02:18:52,090 --> 02:18:52,590
Meow.

4434
02:18:53,910 --> 02:18:54,430
Meow.

4435
02:18:56,090 --> 02:18:56,630
Meow.

4436
02:18:58,650 --> 02:18:59,190
Meow.

4437
02:19:00,530 --> 02:19:01,070
Meow.

4438
02:19:01,690 --> 02:19:01,790
Meow.

4439
02:19:03,530 --> 02:19:04,530
You did it.

4440
02:19:04,570 --> 02:19:05,470
You did it, Doki.

4441
02:19:07,130 --> 02:19:07,670
I...

4442
02:19:07,670 --> 02:19:09,130
Should I told you I'm good at this game?

4443
02:19:10,150 --> 02:19:10,690
Jack!

4444
02:19:20,750 --> 02:19:21,510
Yeah?

4445
02:19:22,910 --> 02:19:24,450
You're so good.

4446
02:19:28,630 --> 02:19:32,030
Oh, money.

4447
02:19:32,550 --> 02:19:33,270
Okay.

4448
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:34,890
Okay, 48.

4449
02:19:35,070 --> 02:19:35,510
That's not bad.

4450
02:19:37,310 --> 02:19:38,390
Oh, oh, oh.

4451
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:40,010
Hello?

4452
02:19:40,410 --> 02:19:40,950
Hello?

4453
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:41,710
Hello?

4454
02:19:43,390 --> 02:19:43,390
Hello?

4455
02:19:43,390 --> 02:19:43,990
Hello?

4456
02:19:44,970 --> 02:19:46,370
Okay, I think we're good.

4457
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:47,810
The lights flickered.

4458
02:19:47,890 --> 02:19:49,170
I thought it was the cheesy guy.

4459
02:19:49,310 --> 02:19:49,590
Yeah?

4460
02:19:51,510 --> 02:19:52,350
It's him!

4461
02:19:52,890 --> 02:19:53,810
It's him!

4462
02:20:03,950 --> 02:20:05,310
Why was he edging it?

4463
02:20:05,710 --> 02:20:07,910
He announced himself three minutes ago.

4464
02:20:08,630 --> 02:20:10,790
Why did he take so long to pull up?

4465
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:12,930
All right.

4466
02:20:13,710 --> 02:20:14,850
All right, you ready?

4467
02:20:15,610 --> 02:20:17,850
All right, Chibi, you want to do one more run?

4468
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:19,430
Let's make a team.

4469
02:20:19,570 --> 02:20:20,170
Let's make a team.

4470
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:21,610
Wait, let's build an army.

4471
02:20:21,850 --> 02:20:22,650
Let's build a team.

4472
02:20:24,630 --> 02:20:25,390
Let's build a team.

4473
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:29,430
We would've... Wait, your access to chat has been... voice has been disabled until...

4474
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:31,230
Until...

4475
02:20:31,230 --> 02:20:33,790
I got, like, an actual, like, month-long ban.

4476
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:34,970
You got a month-long ban.

4477
02:20:34,970 --> 02:20:35,530
What the heck?

4478
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:37,610
Who reported her?

4479
02:20:37,890 --> 02:20:39,790
Who reported my child?

4480
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:43,810
I'm like... I didn't even say anything bad.

4481
02:20:43,810 --> 02:20:43,870
Yeah.

4482
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:46,790
Okay, um...

4483
02:20:46,790 --> 02:20:52,670
Maybe it's, like, those delayed... delayed suspension when you were cursing... when you were cursing at the Tokyo.

4484
02:20:52,670 --> 02:20:54,290
Oh, maybe when I was, like, yelling at the kids.

4485
02:20:54,330 --> 02:20:58,730
Yeah, and then you got reported, and the... the real person looked through the chat logs.

4486
02:20:58,730 --> 02:21:01,110
I did say you will be gunned down.

4487
02:21:01,230 --> 02:21:01,670
What?

4488
02:21:02,570 --> 02:21:04,330
Did you say that in Espanol?

4489
02:21:05,490 --> 02:21:06,830
No, I said it in English.

4490
02:21:07,050 --> 02:21:07,510
I said...

4491
02:21:07,510 --> 02:21:08,410
Oh, you...

4492
02:21:08,970 --> 02:21:10,250
Oh, my God.

4493
02:21:10,550 --> 02:21:11,730
That might be why I got banned.

4494
02:21:11,890 --> 02:21:13,310
I'm sorry for saying I'd shoot people.

4495
02:21:13,650 --> 02:21:14,710
Oh, my God.

4496
02:21:14,890 --> 02:21:16,470
I'm sorry for saying I'd shoot people.

4497
02:21:16,470 --> 02:21:17,010
Yeah.

4498
02:21:17,030 --> 02:21:18,130
No, now I understand.

4499
02:21:18,310 --> 02:21:20,170
No, I understand now how you got banned.

4500
02:21:20,270 --> 02:21:20,910
I was...

4501
02:21:21,510 --> 02:21:23,670
That makes a whole lot more sense now.

4502
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:25,130
Alright, I'm in the lobby.

4503
02:21:25,390 --> 02:21:25,870
Can we please play with the minion?

4504
02:21:26,110 --> 02:21:26,910
Can we please...

4505
02:21:26,910 --> 02:21:27,830
Oh, where are you?

4506
02:21:28,150 --> 02:21:29,090
The freaking minion.

4507
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:30,030
Where are you?

4508
02:21:30,030 --> 02:21:31,010
Oh, I think we're in different lobbies.

4509
02:21:31,030 --> 02:21:31,530
Here, I'll join you.

4510
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:31,810
I'll join you.

4511
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:32,330
Okay, okay, okay.

4512
02:21:33,130 --> 02:21:33,850
There's so many...

4513
02:21:33,850 --> 02:21:34,270
Doodoo.

4514
02:21:34,670 --> 02:21:36,490
My mod is playing be a car.

4515
02:21:36,690 --> 02:21:37,290
What the frick is that?

4516
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:38,330
My mod is a grown man.

4517
02:21:38,490 --> 02:21:39,790
And he's playing be a car.

4518
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:44,650
Freaking grown man playing be a car.

4519
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:46,510
What the frick is he doing?

4520
02:21:46,610 --> 02:21:47,370
Is he also 40?

4521
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:49,470
He plays the German one.

4522
02:21:50,170 --> 02:21:50,530
Hello.

4523
02:21:51,010 --> 02:21:51,350
Hello.

4524
02:21:51,890 --> 02:21:51,910
My gosh.

4525
02:21:53,070 --> 02:21:53,430
Schmetterling.

4526
02:21:53,670 --> 02:21:54,550
Where are you?

4527
02:21:55,530 --> 02:21:56,250
I'm right...

4528
02:21:56,250 --> 02:21:56,730
Oh, where are you?

4529
02:21:56,910 --> 02:21:57,150
Alright.

4530
02:21:57,510 --> 02:21:57,710
Okay.

4531
02:21:57,910 --> 02:21:59,310
We need to build a doki army.

4532
02:21:59,490 --> 02:21:59,570
Build an army.

4533
02:22:00,210 --> 02:22:00,530
Alright.

4534
02:22:01,650 --> 02:22:02,710
This time it'll be...

4535
02:22:03,290 --> 02:22:03,850
Okay, okay.

4536
02:22:03,910 --> 02:22:04,470
We got doki's.

4537
02:22:04,490 --> 02:22:05,150
We got some doki's here.

4538
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:05,530
Okay, okay.

4539
02:22:05,610 --> 02:22:06,550
Okay, let's go.

4540
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:09,110
The frick it should be doki 69.

4541
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:09,590
I don't wanna...

4542
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:10,470
I don't feel safe with that one.

4543
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:10,950
Okay, wait.

4544
02:22:11,090 --> 02:22:11,490
I don't...

4545
02:22:11,490 --> 02:22:12,310
Wait, it's Zane again.

4546
02:22:12,310 --> 02:22:13,430
Let's get out of here.

4547
02:22:13,430 --> 02:22:13,830
No!

4548
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:15,170
Are you ready?

4549
02:22:15,270 --> 02:22:15,710
Are you ready?

4550
02:22:15,890 --> 02:22:16,530
Are you ready?

4551
02:22:16,730 --> 02:22:17,510
Tell him to leave.

4552
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:19,570
Okay, okay.

4553
02:22:19,690 --> 02:22:20,630
But I'm voice banned.

4554
02:22:20,970 --> 02:22:21,850
Oh shit, you're right.

4555
02:22:22,090 --> 02:22:22,470
I'm voice banned until...

4556
02:22:22,470 --> 02:22:23,970
I think I'm voice banned for three minutes.

4557
02:22:24,210 --> 02:22:24,610
Okay, okay.

4558
02:22:24,610 --> 02:22:26,750
So, you need three minutes and I'll yell at this kid.

4559
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:27,530
Okay, okay.

4560
02:22:27,750 --> 02:22:28,490
Let's do it.

4561
02:22:30,130 --> 02:22:30,770
Let's do it.

4562
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:32,230
Get out.

4563
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:33,270
Leave.

4564
02:22:33,910 --> 02:22:34,890
You're not joking.

4565
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:35,410
Leave.

4566
02:22:35,410 --> 02:22:35,570
Leave.

4567
02:22:36,570 --> 02:22:36,970
Leave.

4568
02:22:36,970 --> 02:22:38,070
You are not Dokie Master.

4569
02:22:38,090 --> 02:22:38,570
You're not.

4570
02:22:39,350 --> 02:22:39,430
Leave.

4571
02:22:40,090 --> 02:22:41,390
Wait, wait, wait.

4572
02:22:41,410 --> 02:22:42,210
I got my switch trap back.

4573
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:43,190
Oh, okay, okay.

4574
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:43,510
You must leave.

4575
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:44,290
You're not doki.

4576
02:22:44,510 --> 02:22:44,810
Get out.

4577
02:22:45,950 --> 02:22:46,550
Get out.

4578
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:53,600
You must leave.

4579
02:22:54,380 --> 02:22:54,780
Leave.

4580
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:01,620
Oh he kicked us out of the other way.

4581
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:02,380
Leave.

4582
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:03,780
You're not Dokie.

4583
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:04,180
Leave.

4584
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:06,880
Name change yourself until you're a Dokie.

4585
02:23:09,380 --> 02:23:10,820
Wait, they said they'll pay money.

4586
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:13,720
Okay, you can only say if when we die, you rez us.

4587
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:14,900
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, no.

4588
02:23:15,140 --> 02:23:16,460
No, no, wait, wait, wait, $5.

4589
02:23:18,940 --> 02:23:21,960
You lost only a collective $10, $5 each.

4590
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:24,440
$5 at Cheapidoki's...

4591
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:33,660
One gift itself on Cheapidoki's channel, and then $5 super chat.

4592
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:36,840
$5.

4593
02:23:37,340 --> 02:23:39,480
I'm broke, I'm homeless.

4594
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:41,460
He said he's homeless.

4595
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:42,900
Wait, I gotta talk to him.

4596
02:23:42,980 --> 02:23:43,480
I'll talk to him.

4597
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:47,160
Lord, you will use more than your house if you do not give us $5.

4598
02:23:48,820 --> 02:23:49,820
Give us $5.

4599
02:23:53,780 --> 02:23:55,260
The Toki extortion.

4600
02:23:57,840 --> 02:23:59,740
You said this is how you make money in Roblox, right?

4601
02:23:59,740 --> 02:24:01,160
Yeah, you said I'll pay you.

4602
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:02,200
Were you lying?

4603
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:04,120
Were you lying when you said I'll pay?

4604
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:06,620
How would you pay us?

4605
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:12,040
All right, we'll only let this person play If they go in front of us at all times.

4606
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,760
More like the Mr. Beast of YouTubers.

4607
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:15,680
We'll let this homeless guy play with us.

4608
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:16,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4609
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:23,420
Today, today, we're gonna let a homeless Roblox player play with us.

4610
02:24:25,460 --> 02:24:25,860
Distorties!

4611
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:30,140
If you win, if we get to room 100, you get a house.

4612
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:31,940
If not, Rob, find the house.

4613
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:35,320
You get a Tesla and a house.

4614
02:24:35,860 --> 02:24:37,340
If not, aww.

4615
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:40,480
If not, aww, you lose a leg.

4616
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:43,720
For every death, you lose a limb.

4617
02:24:44,020 --> 02:24:45,100
So lock the frick in, okay?

4618
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:45,320
Yeah.

4619
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:50,240
You think, you think your luck is already bad because you're homeless?

4620
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,220
Just wait.

4621
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:53,340
Just wait.

4622
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:56,920
Mr. Doki.

4623
02:24:58,100 --> 02:24:59,780
You'll be homeless and without legs.

4624
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:00,560
There's a lot of legs.

4625
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:01,220
Yeah, yeah.

4626
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:11,880
And then if you run out of, we're gonna, you know that like, that manga panel meme where the guy is, the guy is just like a head and like a, the body in the hospital bed.

4627
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:13,660
Yeah, that's what he'll turn into.

4628
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:14,340
That's what you will become.

4629
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:16,280
That's what you'll become if you don't.

4630
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:17,540
Wait, they're running away.

4631
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:21,720
Yeah, no, no, no, they're, remember I said they have to go forward if they want to play with us?

4632
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:22,000
Oh, okay.

4633
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:23,780
So, they're gaming right now.

4634
02:25:23,900 --> 02:25:25,140
They don't want to lose their limb.

4635
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:26,240
You're good.

4636
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:27,840
Go, keep going.

4637
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:29,280
They said, please, no.

4638
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:33,300
Please don't cut off my, you're the fucking meme.

4639
02:25:35,460 --> 02:25:36,800
Please don't cut off my leg.

4640
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:38,700
Please, I need those.

4641
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:39,840
I need those.

4642
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,100
You don't need your legs to play Roblox.

4643
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:42,620
Yeah, you can have your arms.

4644
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,100
Oh, I actually went under the bed.

4645
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,600
But then like, but then we'll eventually get to your arms too.

4646
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:51,740
Then you gotta start playing with like teeth or something.

4647
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:52,540
Yeah, with your mouth.

4648
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:53,960
You know like the...

4649
02:25:54,380 --> 02:25:57,040
Where you can like play with...

4650
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,080
I heard it though.

4651
02:25:58,460 --> 02:25:59,720
There's like fake ones too.

4652
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:00,600
I know.

4653
02:26:03,580 --> 02:26:04,500
Okay, oh, I got the key.

4654
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:08,620
All right.

4655
02:26:09,860 --> 02:26:10,820
I got the key.

4656
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:11,940
All right.

4657
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:12,900
Thomas looks like he's...

4658
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:13,840
Zane, go in here.

4659
02:26:15,020 --> 02:26:15,760
Where is he?

4660
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:16,880
Go.

4661
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:19,080
Go.

4662
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:19,720
Vamos.

4663
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:21,040
Pick a door.

4664
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:22,260
Oh wait, there's only one door.

4665
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:23,360
There's only...

4666
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:24,360
I thought it was those like...

4667
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:24,740
Yeah, pick a door.

4668
02:26:25,460 --> 02:26:26,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4669
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:31,440
I see you.

4670
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:32,140
I see you.

4671
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:33,860
I see what you want to do.

4672
02:26:41,930 --> 02:26:44,450
I swear to God, if I walk in here, you're a freaking smear.

4673
02:26:47,250 --> 02:26:48,810
Wait, I gotta go talk to the homeless guy.

4674
02:26:48,930 --> 02:26:49,270
Hold up.

4675
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:50,570
Tell them to...

4676
02:26:50,570 --> 02:26:51,290
Don't tell them to...

4677
02:26:51,290 --> 02:26:52,330
Wait, he died too!

4678
02:26:52,570 --> 02:26:53,450
Are you serious?

4679
02:26:57,790 --> 02:26:58,450
Hey, you.

4680
02:27:00,330 --> 02:27:01,130
All right, well.

4681
02:27:01,670 --> 02:27:02,070
All right.

4682
02:27:02,330 --> 02:27:04,390
You owe me one.

4683
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:05,330
You owe me a rez.

4684
02:27:05,550 --> 02:27:07,250
No, you owe me one.

4685
02:27:07,430 --> 02:27:07,470
You owe me one.

4686
02:27:07,470 --> 02:27:08,130
You owe me one.

4687
02:27:08,490 --> 02:27:09,390
That's fucking right.

4688
02:27:09,650 --> 02:27:09,730
There you go, there you go.

4689
02:27:09,990 --> 02:27:10,790
That's fucking right.

4690
02:27:10,990 --> 02:27:11,730
I know, I know.

4691
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:14,010
I respect the doki hierarchy.

4692
02:27:14,330 --> 02:27:16,330
Yeah, I respect the doki hierarchy.

4693
02:27:18,570 --> 02:27:20,290
Wait, does this guy not have a rez?

4694
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:22,110
Wait, this guy not.

4695
02:27:22,630 --> 02:27:23,350
They sent the face.

4696
02:27:23,890 --> 02:27:25,170
They sent the face.

4697
02:27:25,690 --> 02:27:26,470
So they were homeless.

4698
02:27:26,470 --> 02:27:28,930
They wouldn't have rezzed us, they wouldn't have rezzed us.

4699
02:27:30,150 --> 02:27:31,750
They said, I'll do anything.

4700
02:27:33,810 --> 02:27:35,010
Okay, hold on, I'm gonna speak up.

4701
02:27:35,290 --> 02:27:36,070
What will you do?

4702
02:27:36,790 --> 02:27:38,050
What will you do?

4703
02:27:41,490 --> 02:27:45,010
All right, it's time for the other Doki now to go for it.

4704
02:27:45,950 --> 02:27:47,170
Okay, yeah, they gotta prove themselves.

4705
02:27:47,450 --> 02:27:48,750
All right, other Doki, it's your turn.

4706
02:27:49,010 --> 02:27:50,110
It's time for you to lead.

4707
02:27:51,330 --> 02:27:52,250
Go for it.

4708
02:28:00,710 --> 02:28:02,570
They're panicking, they're saying, I don't know what to do.

4709
02:28:04,410 --> 02:28:04,790
Go!

4710
02:28:05,490 --> 02:28:07,510
Wait for you, no, no, no, no, no, don't.

4711
02:28:07,930 --> 02:28:09,750
We wait at the top, let's go smoke our cigarettes.

4712
02:28:09,970 --> 02:28:13,430
Exactly, I was like, I was like, don't stoop to their level, Chibi, what are you doing?

4713
02:28:15,370 --> 02:28:17,590
We wait here, look at that, see?

4714
02:28:17,710 --> 02:28:20,150
We're better than them, yeah, let's go, let's just go.

4715
02:28:22,630 --> 02:28:23,290
That's fine.

4716
02:28:23,950 --> 02:28:26,350
That's why they live down there and we live up here.

4717
02:28:27,650 --> 02:28:31,370
Jesus Christ, it's like, it's like a movie plot, you're the bad one.

4718
02:28:31,570 --> 02:28:34,550
Yeah, this Doki goes in the coal mines.

4719
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:35,510
Jesus!

4720
02:28:36,010 --> 02:28:37,890
We live up top of the mines.

4721
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:42,610
Wait, they never, oh, they're there, okay.

4722
02:28:42,930 --> 02:28:46,150
This is classism, classism in my Doki verse.

4723
02:28:48,450 --> 02:28:50,070
You must pick a door.

4724
02:28:50,430 --> 02:28:51,070
Any door.

4725
02:28:51,570 --> 02:28:52,550
You must pick a door.

4726
02:28:53,570 --> 02:28:53,850
All right.

4727
02:28:54,010 --> 02:28:56,030
Okay, I spoke to them and they went, what?

4728
02:28:56,610 --> 02:28:57,090
How?

4729
02:28:59,010 --> 02:29:00,510
You must pick a door.

4730
02:29:01,570 --> 02:29:04,710
All right, get out of here, Doki, get out, it's time.

4731
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:05,610
Go for it.

4732
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:06,950
That's right.

4733
02:29:08,730 --> 02:29:10,230
Wait, Doki, drop that beer.

4734
02:29:10,510 --> 02:29:10,930
Drop that.

4735
02:29:11,650 --> 02:29:12,330
Drop it.

4736
02:29:13,390 --> 02:29:14,130
Drop it.

4737
02:29:14,470 --> 02:29:15,750
Drop it like it's hot.

4738
02:29:16,170 --> 02:29:17,190
Drop it like it's hot.

4739
02:29:17,430 --> 02:29:18,590
Drop it like it's hot.

4740
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:21,950
You press X.

4741
02:29:23,950 --> 02:29:24,430
Thank you.

4742
02:29:24,490 --> 02:29:24,830
There you go.

4743
02:29:25,350 --> 02:29:26,310
Of course, of course, buddy.

4744
02:29:26,970 --> 02:29:27,370
That's right.

4745
02:29:27,430 --> 02:29:28,330
We're here for our taxes.

4746
02:29:28,750 --> 02:29:29,990
See, I respect people.

4747
02:29:30,410 --> 02:29:30,690
I see.

4748
02:29:30,910 --> 02:29:33,250
I, uh, ignore the past four hours.

4749
02:29:33,570 --> 02:29:34,890
I, I, I, I respect them.

4750
02:29:34,890 --> 02:29:39,090
Yeah, the last four hours when you cyber bullied of the kid.

4751
02:29:39,610 --> 02:29:40,690
I, I did, I did.

4752
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:41,870
I did get a three-day ban.

4753
02:29:41,950 --> 02:29:43,970
Oh, like a three-minute ban for saying I was gonna shoot them.

4754
02:29:43,970 --> 02:29:46,470
Yeah, when you said you're gonna gun someone down.

4755
02:29:47,170 --> 02:29:49,190
Well, to be fair, only a three-minute ban is not that bad.

4756
02:29:49,310 --> 02:29:49,790
Yeah, that's true.

4757
02:29:49,990 --> 02:29:51,130
Like, I mean, like, I wouldn't.

4758
02:29:51,130 --> 02:29:52,990
You changed that person's trajectory.

4759
02:29:54,950 --> 02:29:56,190
I was their canon event.

4760
02:29:58,150 --> 02:29:58,910
That was you.

4761
02:29:59,630 --> 02:30:01,710
Okay, we're not swindling children in Roblox.

4762
02:30:01,890 --> 02:30:02,550
The frick is that?

4763
02:30:02,730 --> 02:30:03,490
Yeah, we didn't tell them.

4764
02:30:03,490 --> 02:30:04,130
That sounds illegal.

4765
02:30:04,470 --> 02:30:08,510
Yeah, we didn't tell them to go to our YouTube channel and Twitch channel to give us money.

4766
02:30:08,750 --> 02:30:09,090
How could we?

4767
02:30:09,170 --> 02:30:10,010
That's so fucked up.

4768
02:30:12,170 --> 02:30:16,370
You remember those, like, old YouTubers that would tell people to gamble at CSGO?

4769
02:30:16,990 --> 02:30:17,630
You remember?

4770
02:30:17,770 --> 02:30:18,550
Oh my god, yes.

4771
02:30:18,690 --> 02:30:20,730
Like, dude nods at the stake ads.

4772
02:30:21,050 --> 02:30:26,290
Yeah, and then, like, they'll be like, yeah, use my CSGO website to gamble.

4773
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:28,890
Wait, am I good in here?

4774
02:30:28,970 --> 02:30:29,310
Yeah, no, yeah.

4775
02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:31,090
No, it's got, um, it was a bait.

4776
02:30:34,410 --> 02:30:35,630
Oh my god, I lived.

4777
02:30:37,590 --> 02:30:38,350
You did it.

4778
02:30:41,210 --> 02:30:42,950
Wait, wait, what's that?

4779
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:44,250
There's two!

4780
02:30:45,330 --> 02:30:46,750
There was two!

4781
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:53,360
There was two!

4782
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:03,410
There was two!

4783
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:10,750
Oh no, I can't rez you again.

4784
02:31:12,270 --> 02:31:13,070
Oh no.

4785
02:31:14,210 --> 02:31:15,810
It came back.

4786
02:31:16,230 --> 02:31:17,250
It came back.

4787
02:31:17,610 --> 02:31:19,530
Jin, stop freaking spamming.

4788
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,270
Rez me.

4789
02:31:20,270 --> 02:31:21,730
I'm not freaking rezzing you.

4790
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:26,530
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4791
02:31:26,710 --> 02:31:28,110
You go hang out with the other Doki.

4792
02:31:28,870 --> 02:31:29,290
I'm hiding a pee.

4793
02:31:29,290 --> 02:31:30,330
Have a nice freaking piss.

4794
02:31:30,730 --> 02:31:31,170
Thank you.

4795
02:31:31,830 --> 02:31:32,430
I'll lock in.

4796
02:31:35,930 --> 02:31:37,330
This is so freaking upsetting.

4797
02:31:37,810 --> 02:31:38,990
Hold on, I'm gonna talk to this Doki.

4798
02:31:39,390 --> 02:31:40,870
Hey, let's lock in, okay?

4799
02:31:41,110 --> 02:31:42,550
Listen, I need this.

4800
02:31:42,690 --> 02:31:43,450
This is all I have.

4801
02:31:49,050 --> 02:31:50,990
Oh my god, there's two doors.

4802
02:31:51,550 --> 02:31:53,210
It's almost like this game is called doors.

4803
02:31:55,890 --> 02:31:59,430
I muted the burp because I swear to god, I think that's why I got a three minute ban.

4804
02:32:07,940 --> 02:32:09,060
Wait, did they find the right way?

4805
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:12,440
Why the frick am I getting carried?

4806
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:13,760
This is so freaking upsetting.

4807
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:15,140
That's the wrong way.

4808
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:21,440
Oh, uh, trust, believe in yourself.

4809
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:24,200
Whatever your heart says is the correct door.

4810
02:32:26,060 --> 02:32:27,000
You can do it.

4811
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:29,960
Because I'm lagging.

4812
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:33,460
Give me five dollars and I'll pick a door.

4813
02:32:37,050 --> 02:32:37,690
Man, really?

4814
02:32:37,890 --> 02:32:39,090
You, you choose not over five.

4815
02:32:39,170 --> 02:32:40,410
Okay, you don't got five bucks?

4816
02:32:40,650 --> 02:32:43,650
Like, come on, you could, you could, you know, like just four dollars.

4817
02:32:43,830 --> 02:32:44,930
Four dollars and I'll pick a door.

4818
02:32:48,190 --> 02:32:49,430
I'm not, four dollars.

4819
02:32:49,890 --> 02:32:52,090
Three dollars, three dollars and I'll pick a door.

4820
02:32:52,090 --> 02:32:52,450
Listen.

4821
02:32:55,850 --> 02:32:57,410
Yeah, I bet you wish you had three bucks.

4822
02:33:00,790 --> 02:33:02,210
They're not speaking to me anymore.

4823
02:33:02,410 --> 02:33:04,790
I'm like, I, I, I, I, I think I'm yelling too much.

4824
02:33:04,910 --> 02:33:06,230
They're not speaking to me anymore.

4825
02:33:10,570 --> 02:33:12,150
They're not speaking to me anymore.

4826
02:33:13,730 --> 02:33:14,670
Is this backwards?

4827
02:33:14,670 --> 02:33:16,150
Oh my god, you're still alive?

4828
02:33:17,590 --> 02:33:20,170
Yeah, I think my, my guy's going backwards.

4829
02:33:21,470 --> 02:33:21,950
Wait, what?

4830
02:33:26,410 --> 02:33:30,970
I, I, I, I, I tried to ask them to spend money to, to, to, it didn't work.

4831
02:33:31,110 --> 02:33:33,610
This one is, uh, immune, immune to the extortion.

4832
02:33:34,210 --> 02:33:36,310
Wait, wait, did you see he going back?

4833
02:33:36,490 --> 02:33:37,950
Oh my god, he's always back.

4834
02:33:38,310 --> 02:33:38,770
He's back, he's back.

4835
02:33:38,870 --> 02:33:39,750
Okay, he found it.

4836
02:33:40,030 --> 02:33:41,150
He was lost.

4837
02:33:41,730 --> 02:33:42,130
Cyclops.

4838
02:33:42,430 --> 02:33:46,030
He was on his own, he was on his own little adventure.

4839
02:33:48,010 --> 02:33:50,150
Are you, are you, what happened?

4840
02:33:51,950 --> 02:33:52,650
Oh, they're not a guy.

4841
02:33:52,890 --> 02:33:53,810
They said they're not a guy.

4842
02:33:55,590 --> 02:33:58,510
Sorry, I think it's because your character looks, uh.

4843
02:33:58,930 --> 02:34:00,470
What, like, Mocho, what was his name?

4844
02:34:00,710 --> 02:34:01,710
The wrestler guy?

4845
02:34:02,570 --> 02:34:03,730
About Slim Jims.

4846
02:34:03,770 --> 02:34:04,870
Yeah, he's the Slim Jim guy.

4847
02:34:05,970 --> 02:34:07,270
Dude, Slim Jims are good.

4848
02:34:07,490 --> 02:34:08,610
I've never had a Slim Jim before.

4849
02:34:10,050 --> 02:34:14,450
They're like, they're like trashy food that like hits the spot that you regret eating.

4850
02:34:14,450 --> 02:34:16,010
Like a hot pocket, you know?

4851
02:34:16,450 --> 02:34:17,290
Oh, I see.

4852
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:21,110
Like it's garbage, but like, designated garbage you want.

4853
02:34:21,290 --> 02:34:23,010
Oh, it's, yeah, it's Ratty Savage.

4854
02:34:24,530 --> 02:34:26,050
Oh, I know who that is.

4855
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:29,930
Why are you letting, why are you letting, uh, this other Jokey be behind you?

4856
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:36,250
Because I am the alpha, and I, I, I, yeah, but alphas, alphas need to let the other, like, uh.

4857
02:34:36,250 --> 02:34:40,510
Have you, you hit me as the kind of girl who like, like, out on Omega.

4858
02:34:40,810 --> 02:34:41,370
The wolf movie.

4859
02:34:41,690 --> 02:34:43,590
Oh, you, the one where the wolf has tits?

4860
02:34:44,570 --> 02:34:47,290
Well, yeah, they have like bosoms, and I like had a crush on the white one.

4861
02:34:47,470 --> 02:34:48,350
The, the one named Louie.

4862
02:34:48,890 --> 02:34:50,610
The one with the big tits?

4863
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:51,410
The like emo one.

4864
02:34:51,530 --> 02:34:53,190
No, she, she was like emo shy.

4865
02:34:53,410 --> 02:34:54,370
She had like, she had like a face.

4866
02:34:55,950 --> 02:34:56,690
Please don't die.

4867
02:34:57,430 --> 02:34:58,170
Wait, are you furry?

4868
02:34:59,270 --> 02:35:00,490
No, but I'm an ally.

4869
02:35:00,690 --> 02:35:00,910
Represent.

4870
02:35:02,110 --> 02:35:03,550
You're a furry ally?

4871
02:35:04,070 --> 02:35:05,010
Yeah, I'm an ally.

4872
02:35:05,210 --> 02:35:06,230
Wait, what was your, no, no.

4873
02:35:06,230 --> 02:35:10,290
Okay, so, was she, was Lily your like, furry crush?

4874
02:35:10,610 --> 02:35:13,270
You know how like, everyone has one where it's like, you know, there's...

4875
02:35:13,270 --> 02:35:15,410
No, if you want to know which one mine was, it's really bad.

4876
02:35:15,670 --> 02:35:16,490
Which one was it?

4877
02:35:16,590 --> 02:35:18,870
It was Wallace and Gromit, Curse of the Were-Rabbit.

4878
02:35:19,630 --> 02:35:21,310
I had a crush on the rabbit.

4879
02:35:23,290 --> 02:35:24,690
When I was a kid.

4880
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:26,390
Oh frick.

4881
02:35:28,890 --> 02:35:31,790
I swear on my life, it was one of my first crushes.

4882
02:35:33,850 --> 02:35:36,030
When it turned into a rabbit, I was like, no.

4883
02:35:36,030 --> 02:35:37,550
It's the Were-Rabbit.

4884
02:35:37,890 --> 02:35:40,510
The Were-Rabbit.

4885
02:35:40,510 --> 02:35:40,730
The Were-Rabbit.

4886
02:35:40,910 --> 02:35:43,170
All right, let's- Rub it some cheese.

4887
02:35:43,510 --> 02:35:44,930
And then he turns into the fingers.

4888
02:35:46,130 --> 02:35:48,350
Wait, it's this guy.

4889
02:35:50,870 --> 02:35:51,890
This guy.

4890
02:35:51,890 --> 02:35:52,770
You just don't look it up.

4891
02:35:52,770 --> 02:35:53,590
Please don't look it up.

4892
02:35:53,690 --> 02:35:54,590
Please don't look it up.

4893
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:56,970
Just don't look it up.

4894
02:35:57,050 --> 02:35:57,870
Just don't look it up.

4895
02:35:59,090 --> 02:35:59,990
Don't look it up.

4896
02:36:01,690 --> 02:36:03,270
It's already too late.

4897
02:36:03,490 --> 02:36:05,110
That was the first thing I did.

4898
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:09,770
But like... I watched that movie as a kid and I was like...

4899
02:36:10,390 --> 02:36:10,990
Wait a minute.

4900
02:36:11,610 --> 02:36:11,850
Hey.

4901
02:36:12,270 --> 02:36:13,230
Like, I don't know.

4902
02:36:13,450 --> 02:36:14,470
This was... this was...

4903
02:36:14,470 --> 02:36:17,470
Chibi's... Chibi's first boyfriend.

4904
02:36:19,410 --> 02:36:21,690
Well, no, he blocked... he blocked my number.

4905
02:36:21,690 --> 02:36:22,150
What?

4906
02:36:24,450 --> 02:36:27,530
The first person Chibi has ever stalked.

4907
02:36:27,690 --> 02:36:30,370
Technically, my first like love was Bowser.

4908
02:36:30,590 --> 02:36:31,530
Does he count as a furry?

4909
02:36:31,970 --> 02:36:32,150
Yes, yes.

4910
02:36:32,150 --> 02:36:34,230
I had a crush on him after playing Super Mario Sunshine.

4911
02:36:35,130 --> 02:36:39,750
Okay, but are you talking about like the Bara version of Bowser or like regular Bowser?

4912
02:36:40,290 --> 02:36:40,470
Any.

4913
02:36:40,890 --> 02:36:42,350
Okay, what's your favorite Bowser then?

4914
02:36:43,310 --> 02:36:46,590
Probably Super Mario Sunshine because he's like really tall and big.

4915
02:36:47,690 --> 02:36:49,550
He's like, you know, he's like giant.

4916
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:50,610
Oh, so like...

4917
02:36:51,370 --> 02:36:52,850
The size difference.

4918
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:53,650
I see.

4919
02:36:54,290 --> 02:36:54,850
Size queen.

4920
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:55,390
Oh, wait.

4921
02:36:55,690 --> 02:36:58,070
Yeah, because you're into the were-ravid too.

4922
02:36:58,250 --> 02:36:58,670
And...

4923
02:37:01,350 --> 02:37:03,270
I didn't sign up for freaking therapy.

4924
02:37:05,370 --> 02:37:06,290
The frick.

4925
02:37:09,230 --> 02:37:11,010
Oh, Jesus, I do have a time.

4926
02:37:11,390 --> 02:37:11,790
That's bad.

4927
02:37:11,790 --> 02:37:12,710
Yeah, you have a time.

4928
02:37:12,990 --> 02:37:13,790
Yeah, you do.

4929
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:15,170
Wait, what other ones that...

4930
02:37:15,430 --> 02:37:18,330
What other ones that are similar to Bowser and...

4931
02:37:18,330 --> 02:37:19,810
What ever happened?

4932
02:37:20,630 --> 02:37:21,650
Shut the fr...

4933
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:21,990
Stop!

4934
02:37:21,990 --> 02:37:23,130
What other characters?

4935
02:37:23,390 --> 02:37:26,030
Guys, what other characters are just like that?

4936
02:37:26,130 --> 02:37:26,370
No.

4937
02:37:26,790 --> 02:37:27,230
No.

4938
02:37:27,570 --> 02:37:27,610
No.

4939
02:37:27,830 --> 02:37:29,030
We don't even talk about it.

4940
02:37:31,090 --> 02:37:31,830
Yes, we do.

4941
02:37:31,990 --> 02:37:32,930
Okay, we're here to...

4942
02:37:32,930 --> 02:37:34,030
We're here to like...

4943
02:37:35,290 --> 02:37:35,690
King K.

4944
02:37:35,810 --> 02:37:36,070
Rool?

4945
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:37,090
Oh, do you like King K.

4946
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:37,350

4947
02:37:37,570 --> 02:37:37,590
Oh!

4948
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:41,930
I honestly, I think he's cute, but his personality is too crazy.

4949
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:42,750
He's cute.

4950
02:37:42,890 --> 02:37:43,770
I like his little pun.

4951
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:44,550

4952
02:37:45,290 --> 02:37:45,890
He's cute.

4953
02:37:46,030 --> 02:37:47,190
He's got like a belly button.

4954
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:47,670
He's cute.

4955
02:37:51,230 --> 02:37:52,030

02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:12,890
Oh, what about Poe from Kung Fu Panda?

4969
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:14,510

4970
02:38:14,510 --> 02:38:15,510

4971
02:38:15,690 --> 02:38:16,130
So, no.

4972
02:38:16,250 --> 02:38:17,030
They gotta be smart.

4973
02:38:17,190 --> 02:38:18,150
Oh, they gotta be smart?

4974
02:38:18,430 --> 02:38:18,930
Oh, okay.

4975
02:38:19,070 --> 02:38:20,050
What about Bouncer gets an excuse?

4976
02:38:20,110 --> 02:38:21,610
Because he's like stupid smart.

4977
02:38:21,870 --> 02:38:22,190
You know?

4978
02:38:22,390 --> 02:38:23,430
Oh, I mean he's the king.

4979
02:38:23,430 --> 02:38:24,050
You know?

4980
02:38:26,290 --> 02:38:27,250
So, you're in here.

4981
02:38:27,530 --> 02:38:27,630
Oh.

4982
02:38:28,970 --> 02:38:30,450

4983
02:38:30,610 --> 02:38:31,530
Lock in Doki 3.

4984
02:38:34,850 --> 02:38:36,170
The blood rushed away.

4985
02:38:36,430 --> 02:38:37,610
The blood rushed somewhere.

4986
02:38:37,810 --> 02:38:39,630
The blood rushed downwards, right?

4987
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:40,770
Away from the brain.

4988
02:38:42,230 --> 02:38:42,790
Try one.

4989
02:38:44,870 --> 02:38:46,150
Alright, grab the map.

02:38:47,590 --> 02:38:47,830
Hey.

4992
02:38:48,490 --> 02:38:49,190
In the end...

4993
02:38:49,190 --> 02:38:50,450
In the end, I am...

4994
02:38:50,450 --> 02:38:51,710
The superior Doki.

4995
02:38:51,870 --> 02:38:53,010
I beat your personal best.

4996
02:38:53,010 --> 02:38:53,830
You did.

4997
02:38:54,030 --> 02:38:54,850
You actually...

4998
02:38:54,850 --> 02:38:58,470
I actually bowed down because you did actually do very good at this game.

4999
02:38:58,910 --> 02:39:00,230
Especially for this part.

5000
02:39:00,590 --> 02:39:00,790
The...

5001
02:39:01,550 --> 02:39:03,890
Like I'm actually kinda like picking at my skin right now.

5002
02:39:04,150 --> 02:39:05,790
I'm like kinda comparing the voices.

5003
02:39:05,790 --> 02:39:06,550
I'm really sad.

5004
02:39:07,050 --> 02:39:07,530
It's alright.

5005
02:39:08,190 --> 02:39:08,550
It's okay.

5006
02:39:08,550 --> 02:39:09,590
You can talk to the...

5007
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:10,110
Hear me out.

5008
02:39:10,690 --> 02:39:11,490
If mine...

5009
02:39:11,490 --> 02:39:12,150
If you're gonna laugh at me.

5010
02:39:13,770 --> 02:39:14,570

02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:19,970
Cause I'm pretty normal when it comes to...

5014
02:39:19,970 --> 02:39:21,330

No you are not normal.

5017
02:39:23,390 --> 02:39:26,050
It's the first time they came out when I'm one and you are not.

02:39:26,050 --> 02:39:26,370
Okay.

5019

5023
02:39:29,930 --> 02:39:31,110
From Transformers.

5024
02:39:31,490 --> 02:39:32,650

5025
02:39:33,030 --> 02:39:34,090

Plane mode.

5122
02:42:05,470 --> 02:42:07,670
Transformers more than meets the eye.

5123
02:42:12,250 --> 02:42:12,850
Alright.

02:42:16,750 --> 02:42:19,110
I can't remember the artist for this though.

5127
02:42:19,410 --> 02:42:21,390
This artist is like crazy good.

5128

Are you still alive?

5129
02:42:24,430 --> 02:42:24,750

5130
02:42:24,910 --> 02:42:26,030
But I'm making them do everything.

5131
02:42:26,410 --> 02:42:26,670
Nice.

5132
02:42:26,830 --> 02:42:27,930
You should just be at the lock then.

5133
02:42:28,110 --> 02:42:28,670
While you wait.

5134
02:42:29,370 --> 02:42:29,890
Oh you're right.

5135
02:42:30,050 --> 02:42:31,510
I should just be like twiddling my thumbs.

5136
02:42:31,810 --> 02:42:32,010
Yeah.

5137
02:42:32,530 --> 02:42:33,070
Grab the map.

5138
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:34,030
Did you grab the map though?

5139
02:42:34,350 --> 02:42:34,750
The...

5140
02:42:34,750 --> 02:42:35,430
The combination?

5141
02:42:36,610 --> 02:42:37,010
No.

5142
02:42:37,090 --> 02:42:38,210
I saw them going for it.

5143
02:42:38,350 --> 02:42:38,690
No, no.

5144
02:42:38,690 --> 02:42:40,350
You should grab it so...

5145
02:42:40,350 --> 02:42:42,210
You should grab it so you can like...

5146
02:42:42,210 --> 02:42:44,470
So you'll have the map and see what the code is.

5147
02:42:44,470 --> 02:42:46,970
I think they got it already and...

5148
02:42:46,970 --> 02:42:48,490
So I'm going to let them prove themselves.

5149
02:42:48,790 --> 02:42:49,150
Oh that's true.

5150
02:42:49,310 --> 02:42:49,850
Just stay here.

5151
02:42:50,350 --> 02:42:51,750
I just don't really want to do it.

5152
02:42:52,210 --> 02:42:52,290
You know?

5153
02:42:52,430 --> 02:42:52,750
I'm kind of...

5154
02:42:52,750 --> 02:42:52,890
You're right.

5155
02:42:52,910 --> 02:42:54,090
You're on the higher...

5156
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:54,930
Like hierarchy.

5157
02:42:56,130 --> 02:42:56,590
That's right.

5158
02:42:56,690 --> 02:42:57,790
Yeah, so you don't have to.

5159
02:42:58,030 --> 02:42:58,510
This person, sorry.

5160
02:42:59,370 --> 02:42:59,970
Don't worry.

5161
02:43:00,250 --> 02:43:01,130
This individual.

5162
02:43:02,290 --> 02:43:03,150
I believe...

5163
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:04,310
I don't really believe in them.

5164
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:05,190
But like, you know.

5165
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:06,970
It's good that they're trying.

5166
02:43:07,490 --> 02:43:07,750
Okay.

5167
02:43:07,810 --> 02:43:09,610
This is what the plane version looks like, guys.

5168
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:13,090
For this com...

5169
02:43:13,090 --> 02:43:14,150
For this comic series.

5170
02:43:16,530 --> 02:43:17,830
That's a good ass plane.

5171
02:43:22,590 --> 02:43:23,310
Uh oh.

5172
02:43:23,490 --> 02:43:23,890
Uh oh.

5173
02:43:24,450 --> 02:43:25,190
Oh my gosh.

5174
02:43:25,210 --> 02:43:26,210
Look at that expression though.

5175
02:43:27,610 --> 02:43:29,270
Are you seriously a gooning?

5176
02:43:33,190 --> 02:43:35,970
I don't want to know what your search history is right now.

5177
02:43:36,290 --> 02:43:38,370
That is a cool plane.

5178
02:43:42,890 --> 02:43:45,010
Her type is freaking airplane.

5179
02:43:46,990 --> 02:43:47,950
Parasocial Andi's in chat.

5180
02:43:48,110 --> 02:43:50,150
You will never be enough because you don't freaking fly.

5181
02:43:50,170 --> 02:43:50,410
Someone was like...

5182
02:43:50,410 --> 02:43:51,590
You don't turn into a plane.

5183
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:52,270
You don't...

5184
02:43:53,810 --> 02:43:56,610
I don't think this person knows what to do.

5185
02:43:56,690 --> 02:43:57,130
So you're right.

5186
02:43:57,130 --> 02:43:59,290
I have to go be the alpha and go get the thing.

5187
02:44:01,090 --> 02:44:01,830
It's my duty.

5188
02:44:04,690 --> 02:44:05,270
Oh frick.

5189
02:44:08,610 --> 02:44:09,310
Oh frick.

5190
02:44:09,630 --> 02:44:10,070
You just need...

5191
02:44:10,070 --> 02:44:10,610
They just need one.

5192
02:44:10,750 --> 02:44:10,830
Oh.

5193
02:44:11,090 --> 02:44:11,850
You just try...

5194
02:44:11,850 --> 02:44:13,170
Just get the map.

5195
02:44:13,690 --> 02:44:14,510
Get the map.

5196
02:44:14,750 --> 02:44:16,570
And then just try any number.

5197
02:44:16,770 --> 02:44:17,830
Because you're just missing one number.

5198
02:44:18,150 --> 02:44:18,990
I'll start with one.

5199
02:44:18,990 --> 02:44:19,870
So this is your redemption.

5200
02:44:20,190 --> 02:44:21,770
This is literally your redemption right here.

5201
02:44:25,350 --> 02:44:26,270
I'll start with one.

5202
02:44:27,230 --> 02:44:27,530
Okay.

5203
02:44:27,710 --> 02:44:29,650
Guys, I don't want to fix star screen.

5204
02:44:30,450 --> 02:44:30,870
So it's...

5205
02:44:31,310 --> 02:44:31,710
Zero...

5206
02:44:31,710 --> 02:44:32,970
Eight zero question mark.

5207
02:44:33,170 --> 02:44:33,930
Eight zero...

5208
02:44:35,230 --> 02:44:36,030
Eight zero...

5209
02:44:36,030 --> 02:44:36,330
Eight...

5210
02:44:36,330 --> 02:44:37,550
Oh wait no, we also need star.

5211
02:44:37,690 --> 02:44:38,350
They don't have star.

5212
02:44:38,490 --> 02:44:39,550
Oh, they don't have two?

5213
02:44:40,150 --> 02:44:40,550
Yeah.

5214
02:44:40,910 --> 02:44:41,350
Oh, okay.

5215
02:44:42,550 --> 02:44:43,130
I'll look.

5216
02:44:43,770 --> 02:44:45,590
It's eight zero zero eight five.

5217
02:44:48,150 --> 02:44:49,550
Mathematically, it could be that one.

5218
02:44:49,870 --> 02:44:50,270
Eventually.

5219
02:44:50,650 --> 02:44:51,050
Eventually.

5220
02:44:51,370 --> 02:44:54,510
Someone out there has got eight zero eight zero eight five.

5221
02:44:55,390 --> 02:44:56,830
Please take a screenshot and send it.

5222
02:44:57,030 --> 02:44:57,650
You need to see.

5223
02:44:59,110 --> 02:45:00,070
Oh, they got it.

5224
02:45:01,430 --> 02:45:02,090
They got it.

5225
02:45:02,210 --> 02:45:02,470
They got it.

5226
02:45:02,710 --> 02:45:03,930
No, they got the last symbol.

5227
02:45:04,250 --> 02:45:04,810
They got the diamond.

5228
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:05,970
Oh, they did.

5229
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:06,890
Okay, they can figure it out.

5230
02:45:07,030 --> 02:45:07,790
Okay, I'll make my way back.

5231
02:45:07,790 --> 02:45:08,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5232
02:45:08,750 --> 02:45:09,870
Just slowly make your way back.

5233
02:45:14,810 --> 02:45:17,530
Doki should like Chibi because she's kind of built like an airbus.

5234
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:18,630
What the frick does that mean?

5235
02:45:20,270 --> 02:45:21,210
What the frick does that mean?

5236
02:45:21,210 --> 02:45:21,230
What the frick does that mean?

5237
02:45:23,010 --> 02:45:24,170
Why do I catch trees?

5238
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:24,910
I'm like...

5239
02:45:24,910 --> 02:45:26,310
I'm locking the frick in.

5240
02:45:31,410 --> 02:45:31,930
All right.

5241
02:45:32,150 --> 02:45:33,250
The other guy's locking in.

5242
02:45:33,430 --> 02:45:34,010
You gotta head over.

5243
02:45:34,210 --> 02:45:35,210
He's unlocking the door.

5244
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:39,880
He unlocked it.

5245
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:42,820
He didn't unlock it, but...

5246
02:45:44,340 --> 02:45:44,940
That's okay.

5247
02:45:44,980 --> 02:45:45,840
We all start somewhere.

5248
02:45:47,940 --> 02:45:48,460
Okay.

5249
02:45:49,620 --> 02:45:50,580
Okay, it's on.

5250
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:51,640
Just stand in the corner.

5251
02:45:51,880 --> 02:45:53,220
So they can't get you.

5252
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:54,100
It's eight...

5253
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:55,400
Zero.

5254
02:45:56,460 --> 02:45:56,860
Zero.

5255
02:45:57,080 --> 02:45:58,720
Oh my god, it's actually eight zero zero.

5256
02:45:59,280 --> 02:45:59,980
Oh wait!

5257
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:02,760
Oh my god, it's actually eight zero zero eight!

5258
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:04,000
I'm not even...

5259
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:04,120
There's no way.

5260
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:06,180
No, you're fucking with me.

5261
02:46:06,180 --> 02:46:07,020
There's no way.

5262
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:08,060
No, you're fucking with me.

5263
02:46:08,780 --> 02:46:09,720
Hold up!

5264
02:46:09,720 --> 02:46:10,360
Hold up!

5265
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:11,200
Hold up!

5266
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:11,340
Eight?

5267
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:12,600
I'm open!

5268
02:46:13,360 --> 02:46:14,420
Zero zero eight!

5269
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:16,120
Five!

5270
02:46:17,260 --> 02:46:18,020
It's not!

5271
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:19,160
It is boob though!

5272
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:20,180
It is boob!

5273
02:46:20,440 --> 02:46:20,960
There's no way!

5274
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:21,820
It actually is boob!

5275
02:46:22,540 --> 02:46:23,520
No way!

5276
02:46:24,460 --> 02:46:26,440
I can't believe it!

5277
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:27,080
It's...

5278
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:28,160
Oh, what was it?

5279
02:46:28,700 --> 02:46:29,400
What was it?

5280
02:46:29,460 --> 02:46:29,900
What was it?

5281
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:30,700
No, we need to know!

5282
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:31,180
They got it!

5283
02:46:31,180 --> 02:46:31,960
We need to know!

5284
02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:33,300
What was it?

5285
02:46:33,620 --> 02:46:34,380
What was it?

5286
02:46:35,140 --> 02:46:37,020
What was it?

5287
02:46:40,100 --> 02:46:41,540
Oh my god, it was boob!

5288
02:46:46,370 --> 02:46:47,800
We were so close!

5289
02:46:48,670 --> 02:46:50,430
We got boob!

5290
02:46:50,670 --> 02:46:53,170
We got boobie!

5291
02:46:53,470 --> 02:46:55,550
We got boobie!

5292
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:00,660
It's boobie!

5293
02:47:00,940 --> 02:47:01,300
Oh my god!

5294
02:47:01,500 --> 02:47:02,240
That's so...

5295
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:03,720
We got boobie!

5296
02:47:04,240 --> 02:47:05,320
We got boobie!

5297
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:08,980
This is actually, like, a moment in this thing.

5298
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:10,920
Yeah, this is a 10 out of 10 game, right there.

5299
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:18,580
Incredible.

5300
02:47:18,580 --> 02:47:22,300
By the way, the monster's here, too, so you gotta get into a closet fast.

5301
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:23,480
What?

5302
02:47:24,260 --> 02:47:24,880
Get into a room.

5303
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:25,440
Get into a room.

5304
02:47:25,960 --> 02:47:26,340
What?

5305
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:28,700
Get into a room.

5306
02:47:29,700 --> 02:47:31,280
Yeah, because I know you don't listen.

5307
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:33,440
Shut the fuck up.

5308
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:37,460
By the way, the other guy died.

5309
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:38,460
You're the last Doki.

5310
02:47:38,920 --> 02:47:40,740
You're the last Doki.

5311
02:47:40,740 --> 02:47:42,080
The other guy died.

5312
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:44,140
I don't know how the other guy died.

5313
02:47:46,680 --> 02:47:49,380
I ain't spending money right now.

5314
02:47:49,480 --> 02:47:50,660
This is our last game.

5315
02:47:50,900 --> 02:47:52,420
Doki, you got locked in.

5316
02:47:52,600 --> 02:47:53,660
We all spent money.

5317
02:47:56,420 --> 02:47:58,800
I don't care how much you spam res me.

5318
02:47:58,860 --> 02:47:59,580
I'm not resing you.

5319
02:48:00,400 --> 02:48:01,700
I'm not... What the frick you mean?

5320
02:48:02,500 --> 02:48:03,340
It's time.

5321
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:05,920
It's time.

5322
02:48:07,600 --> 02:48:10,460
You joined our lobby and you're not spending money?

5323
02:48:10,820 --> 02:48:11,440
I'm homeless.

5324
02:48:12,680 --> 02:48:13,480
What the frick?

5325
02:48:13,780 --> 02:48:14,600
What is he?

5326
02:48:14,780 --> 02:48:15,460
Oh, oh, oh.

5327
02:48:16,100 --> 02:48:17,080
What does he have?

5328
02:48:17,260 --> 02:48:18,100
I got $200.

5329
02:48:19,020 --> 02:48:19,960
I'll take a flashlight.

5330
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:21,720
I don't think... I don't think it's worth it.

5331
02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:23,840
Listen, I just wanna...

5332
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:24,620
Wait, this is it.

5333
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:24,980
This is it.

5334
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,400
You can beat my personal best right here.

5335
02:48:28,100 --> 02:48:29,020
Easy, watch this.

5336
02:48:29,140 --> 02:48:29,560
You're almost there.

5337
02:48:30,100 --> 02:48:30,280
You know what?

5338
02:48:30,340 --> 02:48:30,820
No, don't.

5339
02:48:30,820 --> 02:48:31,520
Don't spend money.

5340
02:48:31,780 --> 02:48:33,060
I want her to be there by herself.

5341
02:48:34,860 --> 02:48:35,680
I got this.

5342
02:48:36,100 --> 02:48:36,880
I'm good with it again.

5343
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:38,380
All you have to do is get to 70.

5344
02:48:40,020 --> 02:48:41,540
You're like almost there an inch.

5345
02:48:42,860 --> 02:48:44,720
Yeah, but you'll also die too one day.

5346
02:48:45,560 --> 02:48:48,400
Actually, I feel like I'm gonna be that person who dies before everyone.

5347
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:50,900
I feel like you'll die before I die.

5348
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:52,640
Hashtag heart condition.

5349
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:54,160
Wait, do you actually?

5350
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:55,060
Yeah.

5351
02:48:55,380 --> 02:48:56,780
Wait, why are you playing horror games?

5352
02:48:58,080 --> 02:48:59,140
Wait, is that bad?

5353
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:02,580
Yes, if you're... if you have a heart condition.

5354
02:49:02,580 --> 02:49:02,980
Wait, really?

5355
02:49:05,020 --> 02:49:09,380
Did the doctor never tell you not to play games?

5356
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:11,440
Listen, my doctor thinks I'm a stripper, so...

5357
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:12,480
I don't know.

5358
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:14,820
Wait, how... where did he get that implication?

5359
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:16,780
What did you do?

5360
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:17,800
Did he see you somewhere?

5361
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:18,500
I moved to a new...

5362
02:49:20,780 --> 02:49:21,680
Paid me to go away.

5363
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:23,300
I, uh...

5364
02:49:23,300 --> 02:49:24,300
Moved to a new area.

5365
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:24,660
Yeah?

5366
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:26,780
And it was the first time I had to have this conversation with...

5367
02:49:27,480 --> 02:49:27,800
Sorry.

5368
02:49:28,040 --> 02:49:30,200
It was the first time I had like a conversation with...

5369
02:49:32,300 --> 02:49:33,160
A fake one.

5370
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:34,440
About... with a doctor.

5371
02:49:34,460 --> 02:49:34,920
That was me.

5372
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:35,920
And...

5373
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:36,140
I...

5374
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:37,200
I...

5375
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:39,920
Fumbled so hard.

5376
02:49:40,140 --> 02:49:43,440
I didn't know what to say because I didn't want to say I was a streamer because I was ashamed.

5377
02:49:44,020 --> 02:49:44,800
So I...

5378
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:45,620
I also...

5379
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:47,340
But I wanted to say like I made content.

5380
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:48,340
But I didn't...

5381
02:49:48,340 --> 02:49:49,780
Oh, so you thought you were only fans.

5382
02:49:50,620 --> 02:49:51,700
Yeah, I said I...

5383
02:49:51,700 --> 02:49:55,000
Well, for some reason I said I'm an adult content creator.

5384
02:49:57,320 --> 02:49:58,200
And they...

5385
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:59,120
They left the room.

5386
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:00,420
And then they...

5387
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:00,840
Yeah.

5388
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:02,020
And, um...

5389
02:50:02,740 --> 02:50:03,160
Yeah.

5390
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:05,300
It was bad and really embarrassing.

5391
02:50:05,300 --> 02:50:07,040
Like, did you just not see your doctor after that?

5392
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:07,940
Like, you couldn't...

5393
02:50:07,940 --> 02:50:10,400
Like, you couldn't show your face to the doctor?

5394
02:50:10,400 --> 02:50:10,720
Well, no.

5395
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:12,040
Like, I still go back.

5396
02:50:12,240 --> 02:50:13,120
And she's like...

5397
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:14,700
She'll be like, so...

5398
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:15,500
Are we active?

5399
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:16,980
And every time I have to go...

5400
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:17,160
No?

5401
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:19,600
So she's just thinking...

5402
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:20,620
Oh, she's like...

5403
02:50:20,620 --> 02:50:21,780
Those fetish ones.

5404
02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:22,400
You know?

5405
02:50:22,460 --> 02:50:22,840
Oh, yeah.

5406
02:50:22,940 --> 02:50:23,860
Like I eat like a...

5407
02:50:23,860 --> 02:50:24,860
No, like...

5408
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:25,740
Yeah, yeah.

5409
02:50:25,780 --> 02:50:27,280
You sit on cake or something.

5410
02:50:29,300 --> 02:50:29,820
You know?

5411
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:31,480
Yeah, like I dump like tart on my head.

5412
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:31,760
Yeah, yeah.

5413
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:32,960
Then you like take pictures.

5414
02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:34,360
Like show feet or something.

5415
02:50:34,540 --> 02:50:35,720
Like close-ups of feet.

5416
02:50:35,720 --> 02:50:36,120
And...

5417
02:50:36,980 --> 02:50:37,860
It's like...

5418
02:50:37,860 --> 02:50:38,000
You know?

5419
02:50:38,220 --> 02:50:39,120
That's the adult part.

5420
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:41,320
My doctor thinks I'm a fetish artist.

5421
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:42,320
Yes, I know.

5422
02:50:42,520 --> 02:50:43,140
Cause that's...

5423
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:44,280
You keep saying no.

5424
02:50:44,500 --> 02:50:46,400
When she asks you if you're active.

5425
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:47,540
Then you're like...

5426
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:48,280
Oh...

5427
02:50:48,280 --> 02:50:50,140
She does the other freaky shit.

5428
02:50:50,620 --> 02:50:51,740
She does...

5429
02:50:51,740 --> 02:50:53,280
And like shit on bananas.

5430
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:56,320
The fetish adult content creators.

5431
02:50:59,300 --> 02:51:00,000
Someone's like...

5432
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:00,900
Is that actually a thing?

5433
02:51:01,080 --> 02:51:01,400
Cake sitting?

5434
02:51:01,540 --> 02:51:02,080
Yeah, it is.

5435
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:02,900
You actually...

5436
02:51:02,900 --> 02:51:05,060
People get paid a lot of money to sit on.

5437
02:51:05,060 --> 02:51:05,680
Like...

5438
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:05,920
Things.

5439
02:51:06,300 --> 02:51:07,100
I don't do that kind of stuff.

5440
02:51:07,280 --> 02:51:07,660
But like...

5441
02:51:07,660 --> 02:51:09,540
I feel like that's the kind of stuff I would consider.

5442
02:51:09,700 --> 02:51:10,000
Like sitting on a cake.

5443
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:10,660
Like how much money?

5444
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:11,640
How much money?

5445
02:51:12,620 --> 02:51:13,120
Could I...

5446
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:14,560
Do I have to show my face?

5447
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:15,360
No, no.

5448
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:16,040
It's just your...

5449
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:17,300
Your butt on a cake.

5450
02:51:17,680 --> 02:51:17,920
Oh, ten bucks?

5451
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:18,320
Ten dollars?

5452
02:51:19,480 --> 02:51:20,620
How many subs is that?

5453
02:51:21,500 --> 02:51:21,900
Two.

5454
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:22,780
Alright guys.

5455
02:51:22,980 --> 02:51:23,340
You...

5456
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:26,960
No backsies.

5457
02:51:28,200 --> 02:51:28,600
Well...

5458
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:29,520
Actually...

5459
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:30,820
Like realistically...

5460
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:31,620
Like to do any...

5461
02:51:31,620 --> 02:51:33,500
I don't think I could do any like...

5462
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:34,440
Like smexy content.

5463
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:35,240
Because like...

5464
02:51:35,240 --> 02:51:35,820
Okay, but what...

5465
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:36,380
What...

5466
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:37,720
Okay, but what is the...

5467
02:51:37,720 --> 02:51:40,180
The sexy part of sitting on a cake?

5468
02:51:40,740 --> 02:51:41,480
But like...

5469
02:51:41,480 --> 02:51:44,760
Knowing that someone's tickling their pickle to the idea of them being the cake.

5470
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:46,620
Or like that my cheeks being covered in frosting.

5471
02:51:46,620 --> 02:51:47,620
I couldn't do it.

5472
02:51:47,620 --> 02:51:48,680
It's like when you try to...

5473
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:49,600
Like draw boobs.

5474
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:50,040
And you go...

5475
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:50,200
No.

5476
02:51:50,920 --> 02:51:51,500
That's me.

5477
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:52,280
Like I'd be like...

5478
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:53,900
Wait, don't you have a booba toggle?

5479
02:51:54,900 --> 02:51:55,300
No.

5480
02:51:57,740 --> 02:51:59,380
Oh, then what chibi was that?

5481
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:01,840
I don't have a boob toggle.

5482
02:52:02,300 --> 02:52:02,980
I don't have a boob toggle.

5483
02:52:02,980 --> 02:52:04,960
So now we're lying.

5484
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:07,480
I actually don't...

5485
02:52:07,480 --> 02:52:10,240
Like years ago I spent $5 on a boob asset.

5486
02:52:10,380 --> 02:52:11,180
And I used it twice.

5487
02:52:11,640 --> 02:52:13,160
I spent $5 on boob.

5488
02:52:13,480 --> 02:52:14,440
Wait, that's...

5489
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:15,300
That's like...

5490
02:52:15,300 --> 02:52:16,000
Oh my gosh.

5491
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:18,420
That's like double for sitting on cake.

5492
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:20,440
Oh, dude.

5493
02:52:20,660 --> 02:52:21,340
I should reinvest.

5494
02:52:21,740 --> 02:52:22,640
Yeah, you should reinvest.

5495
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:23,300
I should buy a cake.

5496
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:25,700
Come on.

5497
02:52:26,470 --> 02:52:27,120
Oh, frick.

5498
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:28,220
That's the flashy flash.

5499
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:28,960
Yeah.

5500
02:52:29,800 --> 02:52:30,880
There it is.

5501
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:32,020
Oh, you're too...

5502
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:33,780
You're too away from beating my record.

5503
02:52:34,740 --> 02:52:35,820
This is all I have.

5504
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:37,140
This is all you have.

5505
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:39,180
Oh, I think it's the bait one.

5506
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:39,600
Yeah.

5507
02:52:43,100 --> 02:52:44,580
You are sick.

5508
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:45,760
Wait, how did you...

5509
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:47,100
Why would you believe that?

5510
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:47,820
Why?

5511
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:49,260
Because I thought we were friends.

5512
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:51,900
Yeah, but friends lie.

5513
02:52:52,760 --> 02:52:53,340
They do?

5514
02:52:53,580 --> 02:52:54,020
Oh, frick.

5515
02:52:54,960 --> 02:52:55,460
Sorry.

5516
02:52:56,620 --> 02:52:58,620
It's freaking spicy in that room.

5517
02:53:00,400 --> 02:53:01,600
Okay, looking for a key.

5518
02:53:02,760 --> 02:53:04,660
Oh, the key is on the other side.

5519
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:07,240
Key over here?

5520
02:53:07,540 --> 02:53:07,880
Yeah.

5521
02:53:11,970 --> 02:53:13,250
Listen, I dodged it.

5522
02:53:13,390 --> 02:53:13,710
I'm better.

5523
02:53:14,870 --> 02:53:16,210
Where the frick is the key?

5524
02:53:19,430 --> 02:53:20,370
Where the frick?

5525
02:53:21,110 --> 02:53:21,610
Hey!

5526
02:53:22,690 --> 02:53:23,610
Because you found the key?

5527
02:53:23,610 --> 02:53:23,730
I'm sorry.

5528
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:24,670
Someone said...

5529
02:53:24,670 --> 02:53:25,950
Play the sound alert even though they're off.

5530
02:53:26,090 --> 02:53:27,090
I don't know the frick it happens.

5531
02:53:31,050 --> 02:53:32,030
What are you screaming?

5532
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:33,750
I don't even know what you're screaming at.

5533
02:53:35,810 --> 02:53:36,670
Where is the key?

5534
02:53:36,950 --> 02:53:37,950
It was right in front of me.

5535
02:53:38,090 --> 02:53:39,290
I'm gonna frick at my skin.

5536
02:53:39,810 --> 02:53:40,570
Wait, that's 69.

5537
02:53:40,690 --> 02:53:41,470
The next door is 69.

5538
02:53:42,030 --> 02:53:42,350
Nice.

5539
02:53:44,090 --> 02:53:44,410
Nice.

5540
02:53:44,410 --> 02:53:45,090
Nice.

5541
02:53:46,470 --> 02:53:47,050
Oh, oh.

5542
02:53:47,170 --> 02:53:48,170
You're 70.

5543
02:53:48,390 --> 02:53:49,050
That's my record.

5544
02:53:49,790 --> 02:53:50,030
Oh, frick.

5545
02:53:50,750 --> 02:53:52,890
Did you get the fucking nice room?

5546
02:53:53,490 --> 02:53:53,770
Go!

5547
02:53:54,110 --> 02:53:54,890
You get the...

5548
02:53:54,890 --> 02:53:55,910
Oh, my God.

5549
02:53:56,330 --> 02:53:57,290
Oh, my God.

5550
02:53:57,610 --> 02:53:58,610
Oh, she beat it.

5551
02:53:58,670 --> 02:53:59,410
She beat it.

5552
02:53:59,410 --> 02:54:00,410
She beat the...

5553
02:54:01,250 --> 02:54:03,070
She actually beat my record.

5554
02:54:03,750 --> 02:54:04,430
That's right.

5555
02:54:05,290 --> 02:54:05,350
Oh.

5556
02:54:05,570 --> 02:54:06,950
Well, this game was made for me.

5557
02:54:08,290 --> 02:54:09,110
Also wood.

5558
02:54:09,610 --> 02:54:11,170
I can't believe it.

5559
02:54:11,250 --> 02:54:14,410
I can't believe you didn't get this fucked up hallway shit.

5560
02:54:15,370 --> 02:54:15,910
Meow.

5561
02:54:17,610 --> 02:54:18,150
Meow.

5562
02:54:18,310 --> 02:54:18,690
Meow.

5563
02:54:21,970 --> 02:54:22,210
Meow.

5564
02:54:24,650 --> 02:54:25,190
Meow.

5565
02:54:29,590 --> 02:54:29,670
Meow.

5566
02:54:29,670 --> 02:54:30,810
It sounds like it.

5567
02:54:32,310 --> 02:54:32,850
Meow.

5568
02:54:33,230 --> 02:54:33,410
Meow.

5569
02:54:39,560 --> 02:54:39,800
Meow.

5570
02:54:39,800 --> 02:54:40,860
Cat in the backyard.

5571
02:54:41,980 --> 02:54:42,520
Meow.

5572
02:54:43,060 --> 02:54:43,360
Meow.

5573
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:43,980
Meow.

5574
02:54:44,060 --> 02:54:44,780
You did it!

5575
02:54:45,860 --> 02:54:46,340
Yeah.

5576
02:54:47,060 --> 02:54:47,680
Oh, my God.

5577
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:48,620
Look at you go.

5578
02:54:49,240 --> 02:54:50,600
This is Rocket League.

5579
02:54:53,290 --> 02:54:53,800
Oh, frick.

5580
02:54:53,960 --> 02:54:54,460
Oh, mother frick.

5581
02:54:54,460 --> 02:54:55,500
Oh, you're by yourself.

5582
02:54:55,500 --> 02:54:56,740
You're 20.

5583
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:58,080
It's the one that got you.

5584
02:54:58,900 --> 02:54:59,220
Oh, no.

5585
02:54:59,240 --> 02:54:59,540
Oh, my God.

5586
02:55:00,260 --> 02:55:01,560
You get that here.

5587
02:55:01,720 --> 02:55:02,260
Oh, my God.

5588
02:55:02,380 --> 02:55:03,020
You're so lucky.

5589
02:55:04,140 --> 02:55:04,600
Watch out.

5590
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:06,580
They're here to get you.

5591
02:55:07,360 --> 02:55:08,080
I'm scared.

5592
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:09,100
He's here to get you.

5593
02:55:09,380 --> 02:55:09,700
Oh, frick.

5594
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:10,540
Oh, my God.

5595
02:55:10,700 --> 02:55:11,060
He's here.

5596
02:55:11,780 --> 02:55:12,200
Stop.

5597
02:55:12,940 --> 02:55:13,120
No.

5598
02:55:14,580 --> 02:55:14,860
No.

5599
02:55:15,660 --> 02:55:16,040
Meow.

5600
02:55:30,180 --> 02:55:31,380
Where am I?

5601
02:55:35,580 --> 02:55:37,020
I got stuck on a chair.

5602
02:55:37,020 --> 02:55:39,240
Famous last words.

5603
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:41,740
Famous last words.

5604
02:55:41,740 --> 02:55:42,960
I got stuck on a fricking chair.

5605
02:55:44,660 --> 02:55:46,860
Famous last words.

5606
02:55:47,320 --> 02:55:47,780
TV.

5607
02:55:48,520 --> 02:55:50,000
We almost did it.

5608
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:51,420
We almost did it.

5609
02:55:51,500 --> 02:55:54,120
We were like 20 rooms away.

5610
02:55:54,580 --> 02:55:57,840
And like, she's just like, have you beaten the game?

5611
02:55:57,960 --> 02:55:58,300
I'm like, no.

5612
02:55:58,420 --> 02:55:58,800
And you're like, okay.

5613
02:55:59,160 --> 02:56:00,200
Like, I've already beaten it.

5614
02:56:00,280 --> 02:56:01,100
But I guess we can do.

5615
02:56:03,740 --> 02:56:05,220
And we didn't even get close.

5616
02:56:05,240 --> 02:56:06,980
We didn't get to chapter one.

5617
02:56:07,820 --> 02:56:08,760
We got 80.

5618
02:56:08,860 --> 02:56:10,100
We got 80 rooms.

5619
02:56:10,340 --> 02:56:11,580
That's not bad, though.

5620
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:12,140
That's pretty bad.

5621
02:56:12,320 --> 02:56:13,220
I mean, that's pretty good.

5622
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:14,820
That's pretty good.

5623
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:15,580
That's pretty good.

5624
02:56:15,660 --> 02:56:16,100
That's pretty good.

5625
02:56:16,240 --> 02:56:16,260
That's pretty good.

5626
02:56:16,260 --> 02:56:16,840
That's pretty good.

5627
02:56:17,880 --> 02:56:18,220
Yo!

5628
02:56:18,980 --> 02:56:19,320
Yay!

5629
02:56:21,480 --> 02:56:22,880
Alright, we are in the lobby.

5630
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:23,540
Where are you?

5631
02:56:23,540 --> 02:56:24,040
In the lobby, okay.

5632
02:56:24,400 --> 02:56:25,820
You can say goodbye to the...

5633
02:56:25,820 --> 02:56:26,220
We'll say goodbye.

5634
02:56:26,320 --> 02:56:27,160
Let's go to the...

5635
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:28,360
Yeah, let's go to the fireplace.

5636
02:56:29,340 --> 02:56:29,900
Fireplace, okay.

5637
02:56:30,120 --> 02:56:30,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5638
02:56:31,560 --> 02:56:32,600
Let's get in our chair.

5639
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:35,460
The doki's on the chair.

5640
02:56:35,700 --> 02:56:36,300
Wait, you're waiting.

5641
02:56:38,140 --> 02:56:39,520
Come here, doki's.

5642
02:56:39,640 --> 02:56:39,980
Come here.

5643
02:56:40,220 --> 02:56:40,440
Approach us.

5644
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:41,840
Come here, doki's.

5645
02:56:42,340 --> 02:56:45,280
If you're on... Welcome to our meet and greet.

5646
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:46,480
The doki greet.

5647
02:56:48,460 --> 02:56:50,860
Get everybody here for our meet and greet.

5648
02:56:51,240 --> 02:56:51,760
Alright guys, welcome.

5649
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:52,980
Welcome, welcome.

5650
02:56:53,280 --> 02:56:54,200
No, it's like $10.

5651
02:56:55,160 --> 02:56:57,220
Yeah, this will be $10 per case sitting.

5652
02:56:57,220 --> 02:56:58,120
$10 per second.

5653
02:56:59,120 --> 02:57:00,100
Oh, that's good.

5654
02:57:00,280 --> 02:57:00,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5655
02:57:00,820 --> 02:57:01,200
Don't worry.

5656
02:57:01,540 --> 02:57:04,200
I'm the business one of the cheap, the doki squad.

5657
02:57:05,540 --> 02:57:08,100
Out of the doki's, I'm the business one.

5658
02:57:08,540 --> 02:57:10,420
Chibi, what are you then, Chibi?

5659
02:57:11,240 --> 02:57:12,640
I'm the one that eats salt land.

5660
02:57:17,460 --> 02:57:20,260
The real, the real meet and greet.

5661
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:20,740
I eat cold chips.

5662
02:57:23,460 --> 02:57:24,720
That's our special doki.

5663
02:57:24,880 --> 02:57:25,820
Don't get close to her.

5664
02:57:26,420 --> 02:57:27,520
No, I bite.

5665
02:57:30,360 --> 02:57:30,720
GG's.

5666
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:31,080
This is so much fun.

5667
02:57:31,080 --> 02:57:32,180
Yeah, it was fun.

5668
02:57:32,480 --> 02:57:33,160
I'm glad to...

5669
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:33,640
Thank you so much.

5670
02:57:33,800 --> 02:57:34,800
Yeah, it was fun.

5671
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,320
Yeah, it took us so long to organize this collab.

5672
02:57:38,820 --> 02:57:41,260
I was still in my chat because like, I would keep like...

5673
02:57:41,260 --> 02:57:42,720
You were so sweet and reaching out.

5674
02:57:42,840 --> 02:57:44,200
And I'd be like, oh my god, I'm so excited.

5675
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:45,440
But then I'd get really shy.

5676
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:48,200
And then I'm like, I'll just respond tomorrow when I'm less nervous.

5677
02:57:48,480 --> 02:57:50,340
And then two weeks go by.

5678
02:57:50,500 --> 02:57:52,440
And I'm like, oh frick, now I can't respond.

5679
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:53,460
Because it'd be weird.

5680
02:57:54,320 --> 02:57:55,520
And then I would message you.

5681
02:57:55,620 --> 02:57:56,560
I was like, hey, yeah.

5682
02:57:56,740 --> 02:57:58,960
I was wondering if you still want to do this collab.

5683
02:58:00,800 --> 02:58:02,900
And I was like, you know, add me on Discord.

5684
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:04,800
And then like months passed.

5685
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:05,980
And I was like, okay.

5686
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:12,360
I would get so shy that I would be like, nah, I'll just push it off.

5687
02:58:14,300 --> 02:58:15,920
And then we finally got each other.

5688
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:16,940
After like, what?

5689
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:18,280
Like three to four months.

5690
02:58:18,420 --> 02:58:20,380
We finally got our Discord's added.

5691
02:58:20,580 --> 02:58:21,520
I'm not glazing.

5692
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:22,300
I'm not sucking up.

5693
02:58:22,380 --> 02:58:23,220
But you're just cool.

5694
02:58:23,440 --> 02:58:25,760
And like, I need to go under the slide at recess.

5695
02:58:26,100 --> 02:58:27,700
Like, you're the kid with like Bakugans, bro.

5696
02:58:28,680 --> 02:58:34,820
Yeah, you're the kid with the fake Pokemon cards that your grandparents bought.

5697
02:58:34,820 --> 02:58:36,520
That my step-dad got me.

5698
02:58:39,720 --> 02:58:40,940
They're always sticky.

5699
02:58:42,860 --> 02:58:43,780
Always eating them.

5700
02:58:43,880 --> 02:58:45,020
I'm using them to pick food out of my teeth.

5701
02:58:45,200 --> 02:58:47,480
You're like, hey guys, I also have the Pokemon cards.

5702
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:48,420
Look at that.

5703
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:50,860
Look at what my dad got me.

5704
02:58:51,240 --> 02:58:51,900
Oh my god.

5705
02:58:52,460 --> 02:58:52,860
Yeah.

5706
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:54,480
And then, but yeah, it was great.

5707
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:56,520
I'm happy we got to finally play.

5708
02:58:56,620 --> 02:58:58,640
The Toki's got to finally do a collab together.

5709
02:58:58,900 --> 02:58:59,440
It was really fun.

5710
02:58:59,440 --> 02:59:00,000
That was a lot of fun.

5711
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:00,400
Yeah.

5712
02:59:00,680 --> 02:59:01,600
My kid really loves you.

5713
02:59:01,700 --> 02:59:02,660
So they were very excited.

5714
02:59:02,840 --> 02:59:02,980
Yeah.

5715
02:59:03,140 --> 02:59:03,720
Very, yeah.

5716
02:59:03,720 --> 02:59:03,800
My dad.

5717
02:59:03,940 --> 02:59:04,940
Yeah, my child.

5718
02:59:05,420 --> 02:59:05,780
My...

5719
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:07,940
I finally have a dad.

5720
02:59:08,380 --> 02:59:08,920
This is wonderful.

5721
02:59:09,260 --> 02:59:09,380
Yeah.

5722
02:59:09,720 --> 02:59:09,960
Don't worry.

5723
02:59:10,020 --> 02:59:10,480
I'll be back.

5724
02:59:10,500 --> 02:59:11,700
I just need to get milk real quick.

5725
02:59:12,220 --> 02:59:12,900
Okay, don't worry.

5726
02:59:13,020 --> 02:59:13,800
I'll wait by the door.

5727
02:59:13,940 --> 02:59:14,820
I'll wait by the door.

5728
02:59:14,900 --> 02:59:15,380
Yeah, yeah.

5729
02:59:15,440 --> 02:59:16,620
Just wait by the door, child.

5730
02:59:16,800 --> 02:59:17,200
I'll be...

5731
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:19,040
I just gotta grab some milk real quick.

5732
02:59:19,180 --> 02:59:20,660
And then we'll definitely...

5733
02:59:20,660 --> 02:59:20,940
Don't forget the cigarettes.

5734
02:59:21,400 --> 02:59:21,620
Yeah.

5735
02:59:22,240 --> 02:59:22,580
Yeah.

5736
02:59:22,760 --> 02:59:24,240
We'll definitely collab again, guys.

5737
02:59:24,480 --> 02:59:25,480
This is our last collab ever.

5738
02:59:25,560 --> 02:59:27,440
The last collab that ever happened.

5739
02:59:28,280 --> 02:59:31,060
And then Dad never came back.

5740
02:59:31,460 --> 02:59:32,400
Yeah, you've never seen it again.

5741
02:59:32,400 --> 02:59:33,740
This is our graduation trip.

5742
02:59:34,320 --> 02:59:34,480
Yeah.

5743
02:59:35,400 --> 02:59:35,980
Like, I...

5744
02:59:35,980 --> 02:59:40,000
We'll bump into each other and like on the street and then I'll look away.

5745
02:59:40,400 --> 02:59:40,880
I'll...

5746
02:59:41,900 --> 02:59:45,840
Like, we're shopping at Walmart, we both reach for the raisin brand, and you just walk away.

5747
02:59:46,460 --> 02:59:47,940
And you're like, Dad?

5748
02:59:48,220 --> 02:59:49,980
And then I just walk away.

5749
02:59:52,840 --> 02:59:54,760
I'll find you in the milk aisle.

5750
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:58,260
Yeah, Dad, Dad, it's been ten years.

5751
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:01,240
Did you get the milk, Dad?

5752
03:00:05,720 --> 03:00:07,060
This is so real.

5753
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:10,020
But it's been fun, G.V.

5754
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:11,420
I had a great time.

5755
03:00:11,600 --> 03:00:13,680
I hope we do collab again.

5756
03:00:14,420 --> 03:00:16,940
Listen, that's up to you if you get the fucking milk.

5757
03:00:17,620 --> 03:00:24,280
If I come back with milk, whenever I come back from milk, we'll do another collab.

5758
03:00:24,520 --> 03:00:25,480
Alright, I'll see you in ten years.

5759
03:00:26,040 --> 03:00:27,800
Yeah, I'll catch you in ten years.

5760
03:00:27,800 --> 03:00:28,700
Oh, you need butter.

5761
03:00:29,040 --> 03:00:33,320
Yeah, I'll be like, son, I need to borrow...

5762
03:00:33,320 --> 03:00:34,000
I need five dollars.

5763
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:37,160
I need to borrow a thousand dollars real quick, son.

5764
03:00:37,640 --> 03:00:38,980
Why did you invest in hot coins?

5765
03:00:39,440 --> 03:00:43,300
I invested in this new cryptocurrency.

5766
03:00:43,300 --> 03:00:44,840
Do you know about cryptocurrency?

5767
03:00:47,420 --> 03:00:49,180
Oh, wait, but do you know anything?

5768
03:00:49,320 --> 03:00:52,060
Oh, you heard about those new cool things called NFTs?

5769
03:00:52,060 --> 03:00:53,220
They're non-refund...

5770
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:53,940
Oh, the lucky profile figures.

5771
03:00:54,580 --> 03:00:55,300
Yeah, they're...

5772
03:00:55,300 --> 03:00:56,240
What was it called?

5773
03:00:56,320 --> 03:00:57,060
The non-refundable...

5774
03:00:58,740 --> 03:01:00,100
Like, tokens or something?

5775
03:01:00,320 --> 03:01:00,800
I don't know.

5776
03:01:01,100 --> 03:01:02,120
Oh, my God, son.

5777
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:04,120
I heard so much about these NFTs.

5778
03:01:04,460 --> 03:01:05,460
Our next collab, guys...

5779
03:01:05,460 --> 03:01:06,280
I'm announcing it now.

5780
03:01:06,320 --> 03:01:07,340
I know you didn't want to say anything.

5781
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:07,660
Yeah.

5782
03:01:07,960 --> 03:01:09,920
But our next collab, we are starting a cryptocurrency.

5783
03:01:10,400 --> 03:01:12,720
And we're going to pull the rug to everything.

5784
03:01:12,920 --> 03:01:13,800
So, you guys are going to be there.

5785
03:01:13,820 --> 03:01:14,500
Show for five dollars.

5786
03:01:14,780 --> 03:01:15,740
It's going to be called...

5787
03:01:15,740 --> 03:01:16,420
Not a rug pull.

5788
03:01:17,100 --> 03:01:18,780
Yeah, not a hashtag not a rug pull.

5789
03:01:18,880 --> 03:01:19,180
Not a rug pull.

5790
03:01:19,960 --> 03:01:20,820
Get that trending.

5791
03:01:21,220 --> 03:01:21,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5792
03:01:21,500 --> 03:01:22,480
Invest, invest, invest.

5793
03:01:22,580 --> 03:01:23,860
Invest, invest, invest.

5794
03:01:24,080 --> 03:01:25,420
But Gigi's TV.

5795
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:26,380
Yes, Gigi, Gigi.

5796
03:01:26,460 --> 03:01:27,800
That was a really fun.

5797
03:01:28,160 --> 03:01:31,680
Um, I definitely hope we do something like this again when I come back from...

5798
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:32,080
With milk.

5799
03:01:34,120 --> 03:01:34,900
A little bit...

5800
03:01:34,900 --> 03:01:35,260
A big if.

5801
03:01:35,380 --> 03:01:36,120
Yeah, yeah, if...

5802
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:37,080
If I come back...

5803
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:38,740
If I come back...

5804
03:01:38,740 --> 03:01:41,280
But yeah, I hope you have a great time with your chat later on.

5805
03:01:41,400 --> 03:01:43,380
I'm not sure if y'all will keep streaming, but...

5806
03:01:43,380 --> 03:01:44,880
I'm probably going to go make dinner.

5807
03:01:45,100 --> 03:01:45,260
So...

5808
03:01:45,260 --> 03:01:45,640
Oh, okay, yeah.

5809
03:01:45,820 --> 03:01:46,680
Are you going to keep streaming?

5810
03:01:46,820 --> 03:01:47,800
Nah, I'm going to head off too.

5811
03:01:47,900 --> 03:01:49,000
I'm going to get food as well.

5812
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:50,720
I have a nice...

5813
03:01:50,720 --> 03:01:52,040
Oh, you're going to get some milk and...

5814
03:01:52,040 --> 03:01:52,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5815
03:01:52,680 --> 03:01:54,020
Remember, that's why I said go milk.

5816
03:01:54,180 --> 03:01:54,280
You know?

5817
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:55,040
Oh, I got some food.

5818
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:55,800
Oh, because you're going to make dinner.

5819
03:01:55,960 --> 03:01:58,480
Yeah, I'm going to make dinner for us.

5820
03:01:58,480 --> 03:01:58,740
Oh, my God.

5821
03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:01,020
Yeah, of course, for my child.

5822
03:02:01,340 --> 03:02:02,220
It's the best day in my life.

5823
03:02:02,220 --> 03:02:03,220
Yeah, don't worry.

5824
03:02:03,380 --> 03:02:05,180
Just wait at the door and I'll be there.

5825
03:02:05,420 --> 03:02:06,800
Okay, I'll wait at the door.

5826
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:07,820
I won't eat.

5827
03:02:07,960 --> 03:02:08,360
I'll wait for you.

5828
03:02:08,360 --> 03:02:10,080
Yeah, yeah, just wait there.

5829
03:02:10,260 --> 03:02:10,520
Don't worry.

5830
03:02:10,600 --> 03:02:11,520
Don't have to get any food.

5831
03:02:11,740 --> 03:02:12,180
Don't worry.

5832
03:02:12,700 --> 03:02:13,060
Yay.

5833
03:02:13,940 --> 03:02:14,620
I got out of the air.

5834
03:02:14,780 --> 03:02:17,060
And then it's like, she was never seen again.

5835
03:02:18,500 --> 03:02:21,780
You're like, Dad?

5836
03:02:30,200 --> 03:02:30,840
I'm sorry.

5837
03:02:30,920 --> 03:02:31,760
I forgot my watch.

5838
03:02:31,900 --> 03:02:35,420
Oh, frick.

5839
03:02:35,540 --> 03:02:36,480
I thought you'd be dead by now.

5840
03:02:36,680 --> 03:02:37,860
I forgot my book in the car.

5841
03:02:37,940 --> 03:02:37,940
I'm sorry.

5842
03:02:38,020 --> 03:02:39,360
I forgot my watch.

5843
03:02:39,580 --> 03:02:40,160
That was bye.

5844
03:02:41,540 --> 03:02:42,740
Forgot my keys in the car.

5845
03:02:42,840 --> 03:02:43,180
I'll be right back.

5846
03:02:43,220 --> 03:02:44,040
Yeah, I'll be right back.

5847
03:02:44,300 --> 03:02:44,600
Don't worry.

5848
03:02:44,680 --> 03:02:45,080
I'll be back.

5849
03:02:45,360 --> 03:02:46,220
Just wait here.

5850
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:48,660
Okay, Father.

5851
03:02:50,580 --> 03:02:52,520
But it was fun, Chibi.

5852
03:02:52,640 --> 03:02:53,380
It was fun.

5853
03:02:53,580 --> 03:02:54,280
I hope you have a good dinner.

5854
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:57,160
I'm glad I taught you about collab rooms.

5855
03:02:57,720 --> 03:02:58,980
I'm excited, dude.

5856
03:02:59,020 --> 03:03:00,380
I can't believe I can grab people.

5857
03:03:01,320 --> 03:03:03,040
You can also put props on them, too.

5858
03:03:04,300 --> 03:03:04,700
Yeah.

5859
03:03:06,160 --> 03:03:07,760
Okay, now she has ideas.

5860
03:03:09,960 --> 03:03:12,520
I waited until the end of the stream to tell her that.

5861
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:16,260
Because I knew she was going to take advantage of her new knowledge.

5862
03:03:16,260 --> 03:03:20,340
I... I knew she was going to take advantage of it.

5863
03:03:20,760 --> 03:03:21,940
But you can play... Why is it so tiny?

5864
03:03:22,340 --> 03:03:22,700
Sorry.

5865
03:03:23,320 --> 03:03:23,840
I don't know.

5866
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:24,580
That's a fun tip to you.

5867
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:26,060
Um, it's above average.

5868
03:03:26,820 --> 03:03:29,220
Wait, why is it upside down now?

5869
03:03:29,320 --> 03:03:29,660
What the more?

5870
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:30,620
Why is it big?

5871
03:03:30,700 --> 03:03:31,280
What is happening?

5872
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:35,080
I'm trying to make you... Okay, well, I guess this is how it works, then.

5873
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:36,560
It's above average.

5874
03:03:36,740 --> 03:03:37,160
I'm sad.

5875
03:03:37,680 --> 03:03:39,440
What the fuck are you doing?

5876
03:03:39,620 --> 03:03:40,820
How do I take item?

5877
03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:41,040
Yeah.

5878
03:03:41,240 --> 03:03:43,620
I'm trying to make you spin it glizzy, but it's consuming you.

5879
03:03:43,620 --> 03:03:44,400
I don't know.

5880
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:46,240
It's consuming you.

5881
03:03:46,340 --> 03:03:47,740
How do I get... It's stuck on you.

5882
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:48,720
I can't get it off.

5883
03:03:49,140 --> 03:03:50,440
What did you do?

5884
03:03:50,460 --> 03:03:51,580
I can't get it off.

5885
03:03:51,840 --> 03:03:52,740
I can't get it off.

5886
03:03:54,500 --> 03:03:54,960
I can't get it off.

5887
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:55,860
That's just me now.

5888
03:03:56,720 --> 03:03:58,860
Okay, well... Well, look at you go.

5889
03:03:58,860 --> 03:03:58,960
This is supposed to be on your chcevel.

5890
03:03:59,060 --> 03:03:59,220
Look at you go!

5891
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:06,060
Wait, I can't get it off.

5892
03:04:06,300 --> 03:04:07,400
What the fuck?

5893
03:04:07,460 --> 03:04:07,460
What the fuck?

5894
03:04:07,700 --> 03:04:08,420
I can't get it off.

5895
03:04:09,280 --> 03:04:10,280
Why is it...

5896
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:11,640
Wait, I see it!

5897
03:04:11,860 --> 03:04:12,780
I see it!

5898
03:04:13,020 --> 03:04:13,460
Oh my god!

5899
03:04:13,460 --> 03:04:13,740
It's home!

5900
03:04:13,860 --> 03:04:14,600
Okay, I can move it!

5901
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:15,860
I can move it!

5902
03:04:16,080 --> 03:04:16,280
Okay.

5903
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:16,960
Get it off minutes!

5904
03:04:17,420 --> 03:04:17,940
Get it off!

5905
03:04:18,400 --> 03:04:19,400
Get it off!

5906
03:04:19,400 --> 03:04:20,420
That's right.

5907
03:04:21,700 --> 03:04:22,680
That's right.

5908
03:04:22,900 --> 03:04:23,980
It's on you now.

5909
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:24,160
You think you're safe.

5910
03:04:24,360 --> 03:04:24,980
You think you're safe.

5911
03:04:24,980 --> 03:04:28,480
You think you're safe from the glizzies of it.

5912
03:04:29,700 --> 03:04:30,260
Yoink.

5913
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:31,400
I'm taking it.

5914
03:04:32,280 --> 03:04:32,840
Gold!

5915
03:04:33,440 --> 03:04:33,960
We stopped!

5916
03:04:33,960 --> 03:04:37,020
Why is there so many glizzies?

5917
03:04:39,080 --> 03:04:43,360
Why is there so many glizzies?

5918
03:04:43,700 --> 03:04:45,280
What are you doing?

5919
03:04:46,040 --> 03:04:46,940
Don't worry.

5920
03:04:47,940 --> 03:04:49,160
It took up my whole screen.

5921
03:04:49,400 --> 03:04:50,420
What the frick did you do?

5922
03:04:51,140 --> 03:04:52,040
More glizzies.

5923
03:04:52,100 --> 03:04:52,960
More glizzies.

5924
03:04:53,060 --> 03:04:53,760
Come on, we did more.

5925
03:04:54,100 --> 03:04:54,580
Alright.

5926
03:04:55,240 --> 03:04:57,060
Here's my child and her glizzies.

5927
03:04:58,900 --> 03:05:01,900
Here's my child trying to do a glizzie right now.

5928
03:05:02,460 --> 03:05:02,700
We did more.

5929
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:03,340
We did more.

5930
03:05:03,620 --> 03:05:03,920
Yeah.

5931
03:05:04,580 --> 03:05:05,620
You're like pinned on me.

5932
03:05:05,700 --> 03:05:07,000
Wait, I can pin you on me.

5933
03:05:07,360 --> 03:05:08,820
I... Wait!

5934
03:05:08,980 --> 03:05:09,500
Wait, really?

5935
03:05:09,720 --> 03:05:10,200
Yeah!

5936
03:05:10,540 --> 03:05:11,080
Oh my god!

5937
03:05:11,160 --> 03:05:12,440
The frickin' hotdog is back!

5938
03:05:12,740 --> 03:05:13,400
Wait, wait.

5939
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:16,580
You can pin... I can pin yourself... Pin you on me.

5940
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:17,280
There you go.

5941
03:05:17,460 --> 03:05:18,840
You're like dancing on my head.

5942
03:05:19,280 --> 03:05:19,280
No!

5943
03:05:19,360 --> 03:05:20,140
Look at you.

5944
03:05:20,980 --> 03:05:22,960
How will I get rid of this giant hot dog?

5945
03:05:23,420 --> 03:05:26,800
I don't think... No, you keep putting... I'm throwing them away.

5946
03:05:27,320 --> 03:05:29,020
I'm throwing these glizzies away.

5947
03:05:29,800 --> 03:05:31,320
I look like I'm infected.

5948
03:05:32,300 --> 03:05:34,300
Yeah, by the glizzy pox.

5949
03:05:35,340 --> 03:05:37,300
Look, I'm not... Dude, I'm holding you.

5950
03:05:37,820 --> 03:05:39,620
I'm holding you like a subway foot long.

5951
03:05:39,940 --> 03:05:41,780
You're like, um... You're just on my head.

5952
03:05:42,040 --> 03:05:42,240
I went fishing today.

5953
03:05:42,560 --> 03:05:43,480
I went fishing today.

5954
03:05:43,640 --> 03:05:44,100
Look at that cat.

5955
03:05:44,420 --> 03:05:49,260
Why is this... We have a minion on our... Look at that cat.

5956
03:05:49,320 --> 03:05:49,800
Look at that cat.

5957
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:49,900
Look at that cat.

5958
03:05:51,420 --> 03:05:52,800
I caught me a good one.

5959
03:05:53,020 --> 03:05:54,320
You're good now, brother.

5960
03:05:54,640 --> 03:05:55,400
Oh my god.

5961
03:05:55,720 --> 03:05:56,460
You go, child.

5962
03:06:00,080 --> 03:06:02,040
Dude, I love that you have crocs.

5963
03:06:02,340 --> 03:06:03,120
Oh yeah, you love it?

5964
03:06:03,180 --> 03:06:04,200
Yeah, it's on attack mode.

5965
03:06:05,380 --> 03:06:06,620
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5966
03:06:06,760 --> 03:06:09,200
Yeah, it's on attack... I'm always on attack mode.

5967
03:06:11,420 --> 03:06:12,280
Alright, anyway.

5968
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:16,120
That's... As much as your... The time's up.

5969
03:06:16,380 --> 03:06:17,320
Your mom paid this...

5970
03:06:17,320 --> 03:06:18,040
Did my make-a-wish?

5971
03:06:18,180 --> 03:06:18,300
Yeah.

5972
03:06:18,420 --> 03:06:20,300
Yeah, your mom paid...

5973
03:06:21,080 --> 03:06:21,480
Sorry.

5974
03:06:21,740 --> 03:06:26,180
Your mom only paid for this much amount of time for me to hang out with you.

5975
03:06:27,140 --> 03:06:27,780
I know.

5976
03:06:27,900 --> 03:06:28,380
It's okay.

5977
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:29,140
I understand.

5978
03:06:29,360 --> 03:06:30,720
You got... I know.

5979
03:06:31,380 --> 03:06:31,980
I know.

5980
03:06:32,100 --> 03:06:32,740
It's okay.

5981
03:06:32,760 --> 03:06:33,900
You understand, right?

5982
03:06:33,980 --> 03:06:34,820
You understand the drill.

5983
03:06:34,840 --> 03:06:35,380
I've seen 10 years.

5984
03:06:35,580 --> 03:06:36,000
Yeah, I know.

5985
03:06:36,100 --> 03:06:38,180
My mom had to pay for my dad to hang out with me.

5986
03:06:38,320 --> 03:06:38,900
Yeah, yeah.

5987
03:06:38,980 --> 03:06:40,780
She was like... He needed cigarette money.

5988
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:41,400
Yeah, yeah.

5989
03:06:41,580 --> 03:06:43,280
She told him... She's threatening him.

5990
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:44,500
She's threatening me.

5991
03:06:45,720 --> 03:06:46,120
Okay.

5992
03:06:47,320 --> 03:06:48,880
But... Goodbye, my child.

5993
03:06:49,420 --> 03:06:50,300
Goodbye, dad.

5994
03:06:50,600 --> 03:06:51,460
I'll see you soon.

5995
03:06:51,560 --> 03:06:52,420
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

5996
03:06:52,640 --> 03:06:54,120
Wait at the door for me, okay?

5997
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:55,760
Okay.

5998
03:06:55,960 --> 03:06:56,220
Okay.

5999
03:06:56,480 --> 03:06:56,740
Alright.

6000
03:06:56,740 --> 03:06:57,320
I'll wait.

6001
03:06:57,500 --> 03:06:57,880
Alright.

6002
03:06:58,160 --> 03:06:58,600
Bye-bye.

6003
03:06:58,920 --> 03:06:59,780
Bye-bye, Chibi.

6004
03:07:00,760 --> 03:07:01,280
Bye-bye.

6005
03:07:05,540 --> 03:07:06,620
Alright, that was good.

6006
03:07:06,780 --> 03:07:08,860
That was a really fun stream with Chibi.

6007
03:07:08,940 --> 03:07:12,600
I'm glad we were able to finally do our collab together.

6008
03:07:14,180 --> 03:07:14,540
Um...

6009
03:07:14,540 --> 03:07:16,800
Like I said, this has been, like, planned for...

6010
03:07:16,800 --> 03:07:20,100
Like, we've been trying to collab with each other for, like, the longest time.

6011
03:07:20,120 --> 03:07:22,420
Because, obviously, like, you know, Chibi with Chibi.

6012
03:07:22,700 --> 03:07:23,880
That, like, Doki with Doki.

6013
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:25,880
It makes so much more sense...

6014
03:07:25,880 --> 03:07:27,420
So much sense to do a collab together.

6015
03:07:27,740 --> 03:07:28,820
So, I'm really happy.

6016
03:07:28,880 --> 03:07:29,640
And it was really fun.

6017
03:07:29,640 --> 03:07:30,900
I had a lot of fun.

6018
03:07:31,060 --> 03:07:32,160
I'm glad her mom paid.

6019
03:07:34,540 --> 03:07:36,760
I'm glad her mom bought this cameo.

6020
03:07:41,060 --> 03:07:42,140
But, um...

6021
03:07:42,140 --> 03:07:43,840
I'm gonna head off now, guys.

6022
03:07:44,020 --> 03:07:47,320
I hope you guys had a fun time hanging out with us.

6023
03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:48,280
Um...

6024
03:07:48,280 --> 03:07:49,360
No stream...

6025
03:07:49,360 --> 03:07:49,580
Oh, wait.

6026
03:07:49,580 --> 03:07:49,740
Yes.

6027
03:07:49,760 --> 03:07:50,760
Yes stream on tomorrow.

6028
03:07:50,760 --> 03:07:55,460
I'll be playing two hours of Mecha Break at 12.30 p.m.

6029
03:07:57,040 --> 03:07:57,540
Um...

6030
03:07:57,540 --> 03:07:57,940
Uh...

6031
03:07:57,940 --> 03:07:58,560
For a sponsor.

6032
03:07:58,780 --> 03:08:00,620
So, tomorrow's a sponsor stream for Mecha Break.

6033
03:08:01,080 --> 03:08:01,260
Uh...

6034
03:08:01,260 --> 03:08:02,440
Monday, there's no stream, though.

6035
03:08:02,640 --> 03:08:03,620
Monday, there's no stream.

6036
03:08:03,900 --> 03:08:04,400
Uh...

6037
03:08:04,400 --> 03:08:05,520
But I will be streaming tomorrow.

6038
03:08:06,520 --> 03:08:07,020
Um...

6039
03:08:07,020 --> 03:08:07,700
Anyway, guys.

6040
03:08:07,880 --> 03:08:09,240
As always, everybody.

6041
03:08:09,620 --> 03:08:10,840
Stay hydrated.

6042
03:08:11,380 --> 03:08:12,120
Posture check.

6043
03:08:12,380 --> 03:08:14,480
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6044
03:08:14,700 --> 03:08:15,800
And if you...

6045
03:08:15,800 --> 03:08:16,840
Stay up for me.

6046
03:08:17,300 --> 03:08:18,000
Head to bed.

6047
03:08:18,140 --> 03:08:18,640
Because...

6048
03:08:18,640 --> 03:08:19,680
You deserve it.

6049
03:08:20,560 --> 03:08:22,100
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6050
03:08:22,460 --> 03:08:24,880
I hope you guys enjoyed the Doki Doki stream.

6051
03:08:24,880 --> 03:08:26,120
Bye, guys.

6052
03:08:26,440 --> 03:08:27,120
Bye.
