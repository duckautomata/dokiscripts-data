1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
No waiting room!

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,440
We're in!

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,720
Nah, this is the classic Scott.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,060
Best collab ever.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,460
30 minutes late, minus one person.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,500
Okay, you can't blame it on me!

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,700
I'm not the... I showed up!

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,560
I showed up!

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,580
I showed up!

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,400
I showed up!

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,500
You are gonna have to collab!

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,400
You told me not to kill you at the time!

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,280
I didn't tell you shit!

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,140
I woke up!

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,180
That is fucked up!

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,880
I woke up and I didn't even know which discord I'm going to!

17
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,040
Look, I woke up five minutes before...

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,400
No, ten minutes before our collab, but I showed up.

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,600
My only job was to show up.

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,380
I woke up half an hour before.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,100
Half an hour, that's so much better.

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,640
Alright, well you ditto.

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,440
Ditto!

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
What's your excuse?

25
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,280
I like Uta.

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,760
You didn't even tell Uta the time of the collab!

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,820
I can't wait for Uta to wake up and just flame you.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,420
No!

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,600
Boom!

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,080
Uta went offline for seven hours ago.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,200
And I don't think she's gonna wake up soon.

32
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,600
Seven hours ago?

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,240
That means she's gonna wake up in an hour.

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,960
Isn't it 5.30 in Japan?

35
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,920
What do you mean she's gonna wake up?

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,960
I don't know!

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,800
What do you mean?

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,420
What's too sketchy?

39
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,040
What the fuck?

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm amazing.

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,920
What do you mean?

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,620
It's 5.30 in Japan!

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,820
What do you mean she's gonna wake up?

44
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,220
I messaged her an hour before our collab, but she hasn't replied me yet.

45
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,340
Yeah, one hour is really a lot of time to make sure you show up in time.

46
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,960
That works.

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,140
Okay, guys.

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,820
Okay, before we say anything more, how is our volume?

49
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,540
How's the volume in everybody's stream?

50
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,340
How's the volume?

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,720
Is it okay?

52
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm gonna put you guys up a little bit just in case.

53
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,340
Alright, I'm gonna right... oh shit.

54
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,060
I accidentally took a photo of myself.

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,240
Oh my god, I'm a mess.

56
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,540
I'm a mess.

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,280
Why would you be sorry if it's not your fault, Uto?

58
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,640
Yeah, why would you be sorry if it's not your fault?

59
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,680
Look at me.

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,380
Look at me.

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,660
Look at my steam timer.

62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,440
Why do we have to look at you?

63
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,460
Look at me.

64
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,160
Look at me.

65
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:57,500
I would be like, Uto's not here yet because Ditto forgot to tell her the time.

66
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,540
I'm sorry, Uto.

67
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,900
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,000
Alright, let's go make some money.

70
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,020
Wait, wait, I'm not ready yet.

71
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,220
I didn't even check if my volume's okay.

72
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,160
What?

73
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,200
We just... you figured it out in midway.

74
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,400
Well, let's go make money.

75
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:15,660
What do you mean?

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,140
Okay, Ditto's a bit low.

77
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,160
Okay, let me... I need to raise up Ditto.

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,720
Let me raise up Ditto.

79
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,540
Yes.

80
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,260
Okay, I'm gonna...

81
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,780
I'm gonna...

82
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,720
raise up the...

83
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,260
I don't even know if my sound guy's alive, too.

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,580
Wait, how do we point again?

85
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,000
How do we point?

86
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,560
How do we point?

87
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,280
I don't remember.

88
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:41,660
Oh, two!

89
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,680
I remember now.

90
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,520
Here, two, two, two, two.

91
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,860
Alright, whose fault is this that we're late?

92
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,080
You have to apologize to Uto.

93
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,980
Yeah, you have to apologize.

94
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,640
Actually, you're right.

95
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,100
You know what?

96
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,540
Ditto's right.

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,180
Ditto's right.

98
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,020
You gotta apologize.

99
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,720
You have to apologize.

100
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,180
Ah, silence.

101
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,020
Wait, we're waiting for crew?

102
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,000
What about Uto?

103
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,340
What about... What about Uto?

104
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,660
I'm going alone.

105
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,220
Wait, I don't know if the volume's okay.

106
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,520
I'm going alone.

107
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,580
I don't know if the volume's okay.

108
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,900
It's okay.

109
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,460
It's okay.

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,160
I think he's okay.

111
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,840
Is it okay?

112
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,380
Is the volume okay, guys?

113
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,440
Is it okay now?

114
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,060
Yes.

115
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,740
It's okay for me.

116
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,960
Wait, what about me?

117
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,040
I'm talking about my stream.

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,700
You know, before our stream started... Wait, RPR, where did you go?

119
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,120
Yeah.

120
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,340
RPR, where did you go?

121
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,960
Wait for us, RPR!

122
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,120
RPR, where are you?

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,880
Okay, before we started the stream chat, we were talking about, you know, the whole it's RPR's fault and the lore behind it.

124
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,300
It only had... That whole thing started from one stream that RPR wasn't even in.

125
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,940
It wasn't even in.

126
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,340
Yeah.

127
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,020
That was almost two and a half years ago.

128
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,700
It wasn't even in.

129
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,900
And you guys are still not letting it go, bro.

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,840
I wasn't even part of the collab.

131
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,520
We never... I've never said anything after that stream and it's still going on.

132
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,760
It's still going on.

133
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,260
I was literally sleeping.

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,960
It's insane.

135
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,680
This is the lore.

136
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Welcome to the lore.

137
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,660
Are we going in?

138
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,460
Okay, let's go.

139
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,980
Whoa, I'm in.

140
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,860
Oh, there's a lot of stuff here.

141
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,040
Oh yeah, there is.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,780
I've been playing... Okay, I've only played this game on launch, so like, I don't know any of the new stuff.

143
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,000
I've never seen any of the new stuff.

144
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,800
Guys, I forgot guys.

145
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,040
New stuff?

146
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,260
Yeah, there's new stuff.

147
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,460
Oh, you've already played it recently, so you know what the new things are.

148
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,140
I don't.

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,260
Oh, hey.

150
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,900
Oh.

151
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,060
I don't know what you ate.

152
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,100
Yes, you do.

153
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,440
We're gonna get haunted.

154
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,760
Wait, we're gonna get haunted?

155
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,080
Why?

156
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,080
Oh, you took the battery.

157
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,420
Why did you take the battery?

158
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,560
Oh, shit.

159
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm leaving.

160
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,060
I'm leaving.

161
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,820
I'm leaving.

162
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,420
Don't worry.

163
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,040
Don't worry.

164
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:10,800
Leave.

165
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,080
Leave the loot here.

166
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,980
Okay, I'll bring this over.

167
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,160
I'm gonna bring it over.

168
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,440
What a fucking pussy.

169
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,760
Me.

170
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,380
I don't even know what the volume is getting.

171
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,400
Guys, is the volume good?

172
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,740
My sound guy's not here.

173
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,420
He's not here.

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,620
He's sleeping.

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,900
One of my mods, Silent Calcium, I see you in my chat.

176
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,200
Wait, where's the ladder?

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,180
How do we... Oh my God.

178
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,080
Why is it so bright?

179
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,180
Why is it so... Is it really bright for you?

180
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,700
Why is this so bright?

181
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,260
How... Where's the...

182
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,920
Oh my God.

183
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,080
Okay.

184
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,320
How do I get over here?

185
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,600
Oh, I got it.

186
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,660
Oh my god, it's so bright.

187
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
It's so bright.

188
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,580
Where's our ship?

189
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,520
Where's our ship?

190
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,280
I don't know where it is.

191
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,020
Wait, oh I see it.

192
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,440
You know the accident is not your fault.

193
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, RPR drove the truck.

194
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,800
We are gonna do later company at 10 a.m.

195
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,640
And RPR said, no I can't.

196
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, yeah, you know what?

197
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,620
We wanted to do the time that's not 1 a.m.

198
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,160
PST.

199
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,200
Guys, RPR vetoed it.

200
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,600
The only one.

201
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,060
Uto, Ditto and I, we were like, yeah, that's a good time.

202
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,940
Like it would have been 5 p.m.

203
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,400
PST.

204
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,180
We're like, yeah, that's a good, right?

205
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,680
Right, Ditto?

206
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,000
We're like, yeah, that's a good time.

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,260
And then RPR was like, no, that's...

208
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,220
That's too early.

209
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,840
That's too early.

210
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,720
That's his fault.

211
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,500
Yeah, that's his fault.

212
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,920
So we have to reschedule it.

213
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we had to reschedule it.

214
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,740
And now look what happened.

215
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,820
Uto's not here.

216
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,680
Wait, where did Ditto...

217
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,240
No, no, no, I saw something inside.

218
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,640
What do you mean?

219
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,520
There's an alien.

220
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,240
What?

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,460
Okay, we go in together.

222
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,900
It can't... we'll go in together.

223
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,920
Okay, okay, one...

224
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,840
One, two...

225
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,480
One, two, three.

226
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,240
Weren't you inside?

227
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,420
What are you doing?

228
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,860
I didn't trust you.

229
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,820
I didn't trust you.

230
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,200
Because I know you were gonna...

231
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,340
You were gonna fuck with me.

232
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,960
Okay, okay, for real, for real.

233
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,480
Okay, okay, one...

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,440
Okay, ready?

235
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,760
One, two, three.

236
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,880
One, two, three.

237
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,080
Weren't you inside?

238
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,520
Weren't you inside?

239
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,840
Weren't you inside?

240
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,460
Okay, okay, okay, three, two...

241
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,600
Okay, okay, okay.

242
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,800
Okay, okay, okay.

243
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,340
One, two, three.

244
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,800
Okay.

245
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,100
No, no, no, no!

246
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,760
There's... okay.

247
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,040
Is she dead?

248
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,940
I don't know.

249
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
You're fine, you're fine!

250
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,020
What happened?

251
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,600
Wait, what's going on?

252
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,320
It's gone, it's gone.

253
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,140
I see it.

254
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,440
I see it.

255
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,100
Okay.

256
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,580
He's camping, he's camping.

257
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
The main door.

258
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,340
Gorgz stop making money.

259
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,380
What?

260
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,280
Why are you talking?

261
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,560
He said we have to make money.

262
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,920
Hello?

263
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,300
Hello?

264
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,880
RPR?

265
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,620
Oh, it's this guy!

266
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,040
He's friendly!

267
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,820
That's a friendly guy.

268
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,780
Okay, I'm not scared anymore.

269
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,660
I'm playing with...

270
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,820
I'm playing with...

271
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,960
I got you, I'm helping, I'm helping!

272
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,060
I'm helping!

273
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,260
Yeah, yeah, you bring that energy.

274
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,940
We're helping!

275
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,580
We're so helpful!

276
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
Oh my god!

277
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,600
Okay, we made a lot of money!

278
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,680
Yeah, we made so much money!

279
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,400
Yeah!

280
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,080
Yippee!

281
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,980
We're so helpful.

282
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,120
We went to get the other one.

283
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,540
Okay.

284
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,060
All right.

285
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,660
Don't have that much.

286
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:31,860
Okay!

287
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,120
All right, don't worry RPR.

288
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,020
RPR I'll come in with you this time.

289
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,160
Yeah, sure you are.

290
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,160
RPR don't worry!

291
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,340
No!

292
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,840
I did it!

293
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,660
We're gonna head over with you!

294
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,980
We're gonna head over with you!

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,360
Don't worry.

296
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,100
Where are you?

297
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,920
Okay wait for us, wait for us!

298
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,300
We'll wait for Ditto, then we'll head there together.

299
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,460
I can't believe they're making Doki do all the work.

300
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,960
I know!

301
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,900
Dude, what do you mean?

302
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,480
Doki!

303
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,020
What do you mean I carried the stuff?

304
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,300
Is that not enough?

305
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,300
That I took out from the dangerous place.

306
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,260
That is not enough.

307
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,640
Oh yeah, you could have done any of that without Ditto and I.

308
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,640
It's enough.

309
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,200
It's dumb and dumber behind me.

310
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,340
We have G-Hundred.

311
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,380
Yeah, but he's greedy.

312
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
He likes money.

313
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,500
He's a greedy...

314
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,540
I can't wait to sacrifice you guys for the greater good.

315
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,460
See?

316
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,280
Look at him.

317
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,620
He doesn't care about the company.

318
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,380
He only cares about the money.

319
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,740
That's... Wait, R.P.O.

320
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,220
where are you?

321
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,060
Oh, he's so fast.

322
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,120
Where is he?

323
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,060
R.P.O., what are you doing?

324
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,080
That's not scary.

325
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,120
That's R.P.O.

326
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,300
We know that's you.

327
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,700
We know that's you, R.P.O.

328
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,380
That's you.

329
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,440
That's not even a good impression.

330
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,020
That's not even good.

331
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,100
That's you.

332
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,820
That's you.

333
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,880
Yeah, we're not scared of you.

334
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,260
What are you doing?

335
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,040
So why are you following me if you're not scared?

336
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,220
Because we're a company.

337
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,060
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,940
Go make money then.

339
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,540
Then we'll make money with you.

340
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,120
It's dark.

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,220
It's dark.

342
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,920
We don't have time.

343
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,680
We have to go.

344
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,460
We have to go back.

345
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,680
Company together strong.

346
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,200
It's 8 PM.

347
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,820
Company together strong.

348
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:20,960
It's enough.

349
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,100
What's going on?

350
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,020
What is that sound?

351
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,040
What is that sound?

352
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,400
What is it?

353
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,300
It's us walking.

354
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,140
What are you talking about?

355
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,200
I hear something.

356
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,860
Yeah, I hear something.

357
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,720
Don't you hear it?

358
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,380
Oh, it's so dark.

359
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,620
I hear like a laughing sound.

360
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,480
Wait, is this a dead end?

361
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,200
What is that sound?

362
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,100
Why is it so dark?

363
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,300
Should I put my brightness up?

364
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,420
Why are you closing doors right here?

365
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,500
Why do you have to close the door?

366
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,220
Yeah, that's not a team thing.

367
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,320
We're a team.

368
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,660
There's a jump here.

369
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,640
Yeah, there's a jump.

370
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,200
What?

371
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,520
How?

372
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,860
How?

373
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,080
What are you trying to do?

374
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,220
Huh?

375
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,420
What are you trying to do?

376
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,960
It's too dark.

377
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,700
He's gonna fall.

378
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,860
Wait, he's gonna leave us.

379
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,980
We have to...

380
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,140
It's locked.

381
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,340
It's locked.

382
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,840
It's locked.

383
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
What's that sound?

384
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,320
Okay.

385
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,840
Make the jump.

386
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,040
Yeah, go.

387
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,960
Make the jump.

388
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,800
Wait, what happened?

389
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,780
What did she do?

390
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,280
What happened?

391
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,440
What happened?

392
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:25,880
She fell.

393
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,940
What happened?

394
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,460
Wait, I'm scared.

395
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,140
How do I make the jump?

396
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,360
How do I make the jump?

397
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:33,880
I'm scared.

398
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,940
How do I make the jump?

399
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,540
So go back a little bit.

400
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,960
Go back a little bit and jump from a higher part.

401
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,480
Come on.

402
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,720
How do I make the jump?

403
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,280
Wait.

404
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,540
Oh, I got it.

405
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,140
There's a skinwalker with your voice.

406
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,460
Wait, what?

407
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,900
There's a skinwalker with your voice.

408
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,340
There is?

409
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,040
I don't hear it.

410
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,360
I just heard it.

411
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,520
Oh, shit.

412
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,220
Oh, shit.

413
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,800
I don't like that.

414
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,500
I don't like that.

415
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,060
That's not cool.

416
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,320
I don't like that.

417
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,600
I don't like that.

418
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,580
I just heard you twice.

419
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,820
It was really scary.

420
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,440
We're okay.

421
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,940
We're okay.

422
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,060
Oh, shit.

423
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,960
It's 9.51.

424
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,140
Wait, what time do we have to go?

425
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,380
Midnight, I think.

426
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,600
Oh, we're fine.

427
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:18,940
We're fine.

428
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,440
We have plenty of time.

429
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,060
You know, it's okay.

430
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,720
See?

431
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,460
Look, we survived.

432
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,400
I told you.

433
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,460
Company together is strong.

434
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,540
I heard you talking to me and then I heard you in the distance talking.

435
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,580
And I was like, huh?

436
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,960
Wait, was I saying the same thing?

437
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,200
No, a different thing.

438
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,360
Oh, that's spooky.

439
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,360
That's freaky.

440
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,600
Or some laughing or some shit.

441
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,100
That was really spooky because you were laughing.

442
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,320
That's freaky.

443
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,240
Yeah!

444
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,500
Yeah, we did it!

445
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,180
We did it!

446
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,760
Yeah, now that's your fault.

447
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,880
I can't believe that Ditto died.

448
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,320
How is that my fault?

449
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,560
She failed the jump!

450
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:57,800
That's so fucked up!

451
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,440
You let her... You didn't teach her!

452
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,040
She failed the jump!

453
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,320
You didn't teach her!

454
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,080
How do I teach her to jump?

455
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,520
You could have taught her to jump better!

456
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,280
She didn't ask!

457
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,220
That is not her fault!

458
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,220
Yeah, you failed the jump, but you failed it 15 times without asking.

459
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,300
Yeah, but I didn't die.

460
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,840
Yeah, because I helped you.

461
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah, then why didn't you help her?

462
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,520
Why didn't you help her?

463
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,180
Because she didn't ask!

464
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,320
She just jumped and died instantly!

465
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,420
There was no time for me to help her!

466
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,320
How much more do you lose?

467
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,300
What are you talking?

468
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,220
You took the light off.

469
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,020
Yeah, look at that!

470
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
Minus 20%!

471
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,900
You took the light off.

472
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,960
Minus 20%!

473
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,200
I took the light off.

474
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,040
You took the light off?

475
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,480
Yeah, if you didn't take the light, everything would have been fine.

476
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,360
I took the lights off.

477
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,940
I'm landing the ship.

478
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,940
We're going.

479
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,240
I can't handle this.

480
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,000
She died and you laughed.

481
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,600
I took the lights off.

482
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,260
She died and you laughed.

483
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,640
There was no reason to begin with!

484
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,460
I did laugh because it was funny because she was saying, oh, and then she died.

485
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,680
All you heard from Dita was, oh, and then she died.

486
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,460
And then she died.

487
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,080
I don't know if she was saying anything.

488
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,040
Oh, my God.

489
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,780
Someone in my chat said, Dito shouldn't have had to ask.

490
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,140
You should have been a good person and taught it.

491
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,200
Okay.

492
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,960
Okay, Doki.

493
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,760
But in my defense, Dito has been saying for the past.

494
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,640
I don't know how many days, but she's better than me at lethal company.

495
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,360
So, why do I need to teach someone that's better than me at the game how to jump over a fence?

496
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,200
You sort of write though, Dito.

497
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,300
I know.

498
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,140
I know how to jump.

499
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,020
I know how to jump, but I couldn't see anything.

500
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,340
So, it's your fault.

501
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,840
You didn't see.

502
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,200
Yeah, I couldn't see.

503
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,300
Whoa, where do we go?

504
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:53,840
There's a key.

505
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,660
Oh, there's a key.

506
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,320
You can see now.

507
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,820
Now we won't die because we can see.

508
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,380
I have a key.

509
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,780
I have a key too.

510
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,740
Oh, why is it so dark?

511
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,500
What?

512
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,680
It's more smoke.

513
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,980
Oh my god.

514
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,620
This is scary.

515
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,060
I'm scared.

516
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
This is sign of vision.

517
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,180
Okay, I got this.

518
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,040
No!

519
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,300
No!

520
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,600
No!

521
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,040
Oh

522
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,300
my god.

523
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,380
Oh my god.

524
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,460
Oh my god.

525
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,100
It's near us.

526
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,740
It's near us.

527
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
What is that?

528
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,440
What is that?

529
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,320
No!

530
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,800
Oh my god.

531
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,260
What is this?

532
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,220
How can I see this?

533
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,160
Oh my god.

534
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,400
Here is like a lift sign.

535
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,600
Oh, okay.

536
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,460
If we stay here, he won't hurt us.

537
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,540
If we stay here.

538
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,760
Oh, wait.

539
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,900
Did you hear something?

540
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,200
Your voice.

541
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,120
There's a monitor too.

542
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,120
Oh, I don't hear it.

543
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,720
Oh my god.

544
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,700
Oh my god.

545
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,100
Oh my god.

546
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,640
It's okay.

547
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,220
It's okay.

548
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,080
It's okay, it's okay.

549
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,620
It's okay.

550
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,520
We're here together.

551
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,360
We're here together.

552
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,540
It's okay.

553
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,580
I don't know how to fight with this one.

554
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,620
I don't know how to...

555
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,820
We have to go back.

556
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,200
We have to go back.

557
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,300
Where is back?

558
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,780
I don't know where back is.

559
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,840
Let me this way.

560
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,460
Let me this way.

561
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,880
I don't know where it is.

562
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,560
Are you sure?

563
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,260
Oh my god.

564
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,200
It's behind us.

565
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
It's behind us.

566
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,740
Okay.

567
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,180
Okay.

568
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,720
Wait, wait, wait.

569
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
This is dead end.

570
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,840
This is dead end.

571
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,320
I see it.

572
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,320
Okay, okay.

573
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,100
Where do we go?

574
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,160
Oh, okay.

575
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,900
I'm getting here.

576
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,560
Okay, okay.

577
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,180
Okay.

578
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,400
Okay.

579
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,840
Okay.

580
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,140
Okay, okay.

581
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,280
Okay, okay.

582
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,660
I'm leaving.

583
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,500
I'm leaving.

584
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,040
I'm leaving.

585
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,280
I'm leaving.

586
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,820
What the fuck was that?

587
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,420
Oh my god.

588
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,300
I'm going.

589
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm going.

590
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,780
I'm leaving.

591
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,740
Where's the ship?

592
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,320
I don't know where the ship is.

593
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,660
I don't know where the ship is.

594
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,440
Okay, we're gonna... We're okay.

595
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,980
We're alive.

596
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,720
Where's the ship?

597
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,960
I don't know where it is.

598
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,320
This ship went from zero to a hundred so fast.

599
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,520
Look.

600
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:00,740
Look.

601
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,920
It's survival of the fittest.

602
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,840
I have loot.

603
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,280
I have loot.

604
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,340
Where's the ship?

605
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,720
I'm so confused.

606
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,340
I'm so confused.

607
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,800
Oh, there it is.

608
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,260
There it is.

609
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,080
I found it.

610
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,140
I found it, guys.

611
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,720
I found it.

612
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,680
This is important.

613
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,660
We need... We need...

614
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,080
We need loot.

615
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,500
Okay.

616
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,440
Look.

617
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,180
We need the loot because... because...

618
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,000
Ditto keeps dying so we need the money.

619
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,060
Hey.

620
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,240
Is... What happened to Ditto?

621
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,560
Is Ditto dead?

622
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,040
I was gonna help her because there was a thing on her head.

623
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,320
Yeah.

624
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,620
But then Bracken came and I was like, Yeah, we're good.

625
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,220
Is she dead?

626
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,980
Yeah, she's dead.

627
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,520
I mean, why did you let her die again?

628
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,300
She's bad.

629
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,460
What do you want from me?

630
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,120
We're leaving.

631
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,740
Whoa!

632
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,100
That's fucked up.

633
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,340
She's not bad.

634
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,840
You're just a bad teacher.

635
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,820
You're just a bad teacher.

636
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,400
I was not even teaching her anything.

637
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,680
How is it my fault?

638
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,020
You're a bad teacher.

639
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,620
She's better than me apparently.

640
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,660
She's supposed to be teaching me.

641
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,660
She's better than me.

642
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,540
Oh, no.

643
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,420
This is the second time that you...

644
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,100
This is the second time you didn't teach her.

645
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,140
Okay, bro.

646
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,720
Oh my god.

647
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,080
Oh my god, dude.

648
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,120
You killed me.

649
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,400
Yeah, you killed her.

650
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,280
How did I kill you?

651
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:40,920
I didn't kill you.

652
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,460
I didn't kill you.

653
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I can't believe you blamed the student.

654
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,860
I was gonna help you.

655
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,920
I was gonna help you get the thing off your head by fucking through the door, but then Bracken showed up and then that was it.

656
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,420
That was it.

657
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,120
I can't believe it.

658
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,100
I can't believe it.

659
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,300
I can't believe you would do that to her.

660
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,560
You were supposed to be our supervisor.

661
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,460
You're like our supervisor.

662
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,520
You're not supervising good enough.

663
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,560
You should see the DMs between me and her.

664
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,140
She says she's better than me.

665
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,920
Is that true, Zito?

666
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,700
She's a part-timer.

667
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,580
Is that true?

668
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,940
What's my title?

669
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,340
Your title is leader.

670
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,260
That means you're better.

671
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,440
Your title is actually leader.

672
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,820
You have leaders.

673
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,180
You're literally the supervisor.

674
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,220
You're the leader.

675
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,240
Don't leave us.

676
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,200
You said you're better than me.

677
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,100
I am better than you.

678
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,300
So you should show me where to go.

679
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,820
She's a part-timer.

680
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,080
You're literally the leader.

681
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,400
I'm better than you just in text.

682
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,880
You're just better than me in text, but not in the actual.

683
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,080
So you're not better than me.

684
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,980
Are you better than RPR, Ditto?

685
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,800
Are you better than RPR?

686
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,540
I'm better than RPR.

687
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,680
Okay, then you're going first.

688
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,280
I follow RPR.

689
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,000
No, no, no.

690
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,400
You're going first.

691
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,760
Wait, but if you're better, then you should be the leader.

692
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,960
You should be the leader, Ditto.

693
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,520
You're better.

694
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,600
I know my place.

695
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,720
I know my place.

696
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,160
I'm bad.

697
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,040
She's so dead.

698
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,160
Where do we go, Ditto?

699
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,520
Come here.

700
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,760
Where?

701
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,660
Go first.

702
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,060
Where is here?

703
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,840
Here.

704
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,480
Okay, we're behind you.

705
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,300
We're following you.

706
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,640
Oh my god.

707
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,420
There's a turret.

708
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,120
You just gotta walk next to a turret.

709
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,080
Yeah, but we're okay.

710
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:35,480
Which one?

711
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,540
It's a turret.

712
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,280
It's a turret.

713
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,620
Wait, what is a turret?

714
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,840
What is a turret?

715
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,180
No, that doesn't.

716
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,160
The next turret is the third.

717
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,400
Wait, no.

718
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,600
We just have to run past it.

719
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,360
You can do it.

720
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,580
See?

721
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,120
Look, you did it, RPRO.

722
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,080
What is this?

723
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,900
The back room?

724
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,820
What is this shit?

725
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:01,720
See?

726
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,080
See?

727
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,120
She didn't...

728
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,180
She wasn't scared.

729
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,040
You almost died three times, Ditto.

730
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,420
It's okay.

731
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,880
I don't know.

732
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,900
She seems to...

733
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,160
She didn't die, though.

734
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,000
She's standing next to the turret.

735
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,700
And she's like, what?

736
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,680
I can see it.

737
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,760
That's true.

738
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
That's true, though.

739
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,200
That's true.

740
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,180
Oh, I'm scared.

741
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,420
It's...

742
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,040
It's so dark here.

743
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,360
It's so dark.

744
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,920
Wait, I thought Ditto was like...

745
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,540
Oh, shit.

746
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,380
What is that?

747
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,100
What is that?

748
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,620
What is that?

749
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,100
What is that?

750
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,140
I've never seen that before.

751
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,940
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

752
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,940
What is that?

753
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,440
That's a thing.

754
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
What is the thing?

755
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,380
Don't look away, you fucking...

756
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,340
I'm gonna rescue you.

757
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,180
I'll be okay.

758
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
Okay, okay.

759
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,820
If you look away, fall.

760
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,300
A little pause.

761
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,240
It's like the annual.

762
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
So, if I do this?

763
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,460
So...

764
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

765
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

766
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,000
Help me.

767
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,100
Help me.

768
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,120
No.

769
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,940
I got a flashlight.

770
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,780
I got a flashlight.

771
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:15,480
I got a flashlight.

772
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Pick up the load.

773
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,540
No!

774
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,120
No!

775
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,200
Keep looking!

776
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,100
Go!

777
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,880
Go!

778
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:24,900
Go!

779
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,380
Keep looking!

780
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,820
I'm watching!

781
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,320
Go, Eric!

782
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,040
Go, Eric!

783
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,060
Now it's over!

784
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,970
It's over!

785
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,370
It's over!

786
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,570
Wait,

787
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,420
she fell off the map, didn't she?

788
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,260
Oh my god!

789
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,600
That's so creepy!

790
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,980
That's so creepy!

791
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,760
I didn't realize that's a hole!

792
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,380
Oh my god!

793
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,200
I didn't realize that was a hole!

794
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,790
I'm scared!

795
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm so scared!

796
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,860
I'm so scared!

797
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,220
I'm so scared!

798
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,640
I'm so scared!

799
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,460
Oh no!

800
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,200
He's so dead!

801
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,000
Okay!

802
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,660
Can he open doors?

803
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,060
Can he open doors?

804
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,440
Door?

805
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,180
Oh, is he dead?

806
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,080
Yeah, can he open doors?

807
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,000
Wait, wait, wait!

808
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,720
Wait!

809
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,660
I hear your voice too!

810
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,780
Wait, you hear my voice?

811
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,100
I don't hear any of the skinwalkers!

812
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,500
I'm so dead right now.

813
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,380
Did I install it wrong?

814
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,140
Okay, he's dead end.

815
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,400
Oh, he's dead end.

816
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,120
He's so fucked.

817
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,020
He's dead end.

818
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,020
How can, how can we...

819
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,160
Oh, he's right there!

820
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,460
Wait, he can open doors!

821
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,720
He can open doors!

822
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,060
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

823
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,480
Oh!

824
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,800
It would be so funny if there was a monster behind him.

825
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,340
That would be so funny.

826
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,400
Oh, what the heck!

827
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,840
He can open the door too!

828
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,080
What?

829
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,000
It's scary!

830
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,060
Oh?

831
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,220
It's scary!

832
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,840
I need the fucking side door chat!

833
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,440
Wait, we can't...

834
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,740
He can't die though!

835
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,820
Because we have so much loot!

836
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
If he dies, we lose everything!

837
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,320
Oh, PR!

838
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,340
If he dies, we lose everything!

839
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,560
What's that sound?

840
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,760
Is, is he dead end?

841
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:40,840
No?

842
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,720
No, no, he's trying to find a side door.

843
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,120
He's thinking he's not following me without making any audio.

844
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I saw it!

845
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,280
I saw it!

846
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,220
Saw what?

847
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,640
Saw what?

848
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,620
I saw the, I saw the, the, the, the, the, the, the guy!

849
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,340
I don't think he saw it!

850
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:55,800
Okay, okay.

851
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,640
Oh, oh!

852
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,600
He went, he went the other side.

853
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,440
Get the fuck out of me, bitch!

854
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,880
What the fuck?

855
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,040
Oh shit!

856
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,900
Oh my god, he didn't see it!

857
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,700
I saw it!

858
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,920
How am I gonna get out?

859
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh, that's so scary!

860
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,460
Oh my god!

861
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,500
That's so scary!

862
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,220
Oh, that's so scary!

863
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,020
Oh my god!

864
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,060
Oh my god!

865
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,720
Oh my god!

866
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,860
Oh, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!

867
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,420
He's so dead!

868
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,600
What is he doing?

869
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,940
What is this spider bomb?

870
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,460
Oh my god!

871
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,500
Oh my god, what the fuck?

872
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,500
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

873
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,880
Okay, I'm gonna hot shit this, like it's Joe work.

874
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,700
Oh my god!

875
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,580
Oh my god!

876
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,020
What is he gonna do?

877
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,580
Joe, what are you doing?

878
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,840
What is he gonna do?

879
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,500
What the fuck is this?

880
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,360
Is it over?

881
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,780
I think so, I don't think he's gonna live.

882
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,380
What if I...

883
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,080
I don't think he's gonna live.

884
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,200
There's no way.

885
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,280
Fuck it.

886
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,760
Ah!

887
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,520
Yes!

888
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,880
I live!

889
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,720
I have no weapon!

890
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,680
Bro!

891
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,400
I feel like a guy!

892
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:24,280
The core is fine, but the big fucker with the white shoulders came, man.

893
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,540
Oh, how could you do this?

894
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,640
Why didn't you tell me there was a hole there?

895
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,980
How did you guys...

896
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,740
I jumped into the hole.

897
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,340
Oh, wait, we lost.

898
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,560
We lost everything.

899
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,520
Yeah, we lost everything.

900
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,980
We lost everything.

901
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,740
We jumped into the hole and it's a fucking bomb!

902
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,720
I didn't know!

903
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,960
I thought there was a platform!

904
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,580
You didn't tell me!

905
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,880
I didn't tell you!

906
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,240
You didn't tell me!

907
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,120
You're the leader!

908
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,540
You're the leader!

909
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,400
You're the leader!

910
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,980
Oh my God!

911
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,560
Ay caramba!

912
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,140
We're so dead.

913
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,120
There's no way!

914
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,880
It's zero days!

915
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
We don't have anything!

916
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,160
Goodbye!

917
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,120
Oh!

918
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,020
What's life?

919
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,360
How does anyone...

920
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,560
We all die!

921
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,620
There's no reason!

922
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,680
We have no money!

923
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,720
The company can't kill us if we kill ourselves first.

924
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,620
We have no money!

925
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,680
Our life was in our own hands.

926
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,740
Our life was in our own hands.

927
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,480
We had like 400.

928
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,320
Yeah, you guys definitely had 400.

929
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,280
You guys did great.

930
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,400
You guys did amazing, guys.

931
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,160
I can't believe we're getting a game over already.

932
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,540
I thought I was playing with pros.

933
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,600
What happened?

934
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,080
I'm doing my part.

935
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,740
I thought I was playing with pro players.

936
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,640
I'm the baby.

937
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,560
I told you guys I was the baby.

938
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,230
You know what?

939
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,490
If Uto was here...

940
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,810
If Udo was here, this wouldn't have happened.

941
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,070
It would go exactly the same.

942
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,750
If Udo was here, she would have helped carry us.

943
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,730
She's a good player.

944
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,270
She's very good at this game.

945
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,790
Yeah, she would be a team player.

946
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,550
So really, it's Ditto's fault we're losing because she didn't tell Udo the time.

947
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,050
Wow.

948
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,270
Yeah, honestly, I agree.

949
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,050
Because I know it's not my fault.

950
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,710
I showed up.

951
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,010
I was a guest.

952
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,850
I did my part.

953
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,950
That was my only job.

954
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:58,050
Put it on my schedule and then show up.

955
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,770
That was my only job.

956
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,330
I didn't look at the hazard level and now it's foggy.

957
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,190
I can't see anything.

958
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,050
Oh my god.

959
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,730
I can't see.

960
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,830
So many ads.

961
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,910
What is Tyler Wong doing?

962
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,810
I can't see.

963
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,790
I'm here.

964
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,670
Oh my gosh, where is the door?

965
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,430
Oh, there's the door.

966
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:20,930
Okay.

967
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,810
Okay, only one.

968
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,750
Where did he go?

969
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,970
There's a turret.

970
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,930
That's the only way we can go though.

971
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,930
No, we're going there.

972
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:32,790
Oh, okay.

973
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,350
Okay, okay.

974
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,830
Mine on the left.

975
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,350
There's a mine.

976
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,430
What's that?

977
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,350
Oh, is that a key?

978
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:44,810
Yeah.

979
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,070
Yeah.

980
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,590
I heard another mine.

981
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,830
There's another mine.

982
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,130
Where is it?

983
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,330
I hear it.

984
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,070
Don't you hear the...

985
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,530
Yeah, but I don't see it.

986
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,050
Wait, I hear my voice.

987
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,290
Oh, so we all want to go in.

988
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,170
Okay.

989
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,230
I heard my own voice somewhere.

990
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,930
Yeah, but you were talking.

991
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,590
Yeah.

992
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,690
I don't know if that was a skinwalker or something.

993
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,050
Or like...

994
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,150
Or like somebody's mic.

995
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,330
I didn't hear the skinwalker.

996
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,210
I didn't hear the skinwalker.

997
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,150
Oh, maybe it's the echo.

998
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:25,630
Okay.

999
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,170
Wait, isn't this the bracket room?

1000
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,490
Wait, there's a key.

1001
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,030
You need to take it.

1002
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,410
Wait, there's a key.

1003
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:32,410
You need to take it.

1004
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,230
Yeah, this is the back room.

1005
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,650
Like, east or right, I guess.

1006
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,110
Okay.

1007
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,970
What's that?

1008
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:40,750
Okay.

1009
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,890
There is a tattered metal sheet.

1010
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,470
I'll take that.

1011
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,210
It's like stuck.

1012
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,450
Yeah.

1013
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,050
How do I grab it?

1014
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,830
I took it.

1015
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,210
I took it.

1016
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,650
Oh, okay.

1017
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,310
Jumping time.

1018
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,170
Ow!

1019
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,170
I made it.

1020
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,090
There's two engines here, but I'm a fool.

1021
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,510
I can do this.

1022
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,070
Wait.

1023
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,350
I can do it.

1024
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:07,910
Can you carry this key?

1025
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,170
Yeah, I can carry it.

1026
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,710
Okay, there's two engines here, and those are expens- Uh-huh.

1027
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,690
Where do we do this?

1028
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,430
We have to find the side door.

1029
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,370
We can't jump backwards.

1030
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:20,930
We have to find the side door.

1031
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:20,930
We can't jump backwards.

1032
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,690
Wait, why can't we jump backwards?

1033
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:23,950
Why?

1034
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:24,750
Why can't?

1035
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,350
Because we're carrying an engine.

1036
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,390
Oh!

1037
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,310
Wait, why can't you jump forward?

1038
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,690
I mean, we could jump backwards.

1039
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,350
Wait, why can't I see shit in here?

1040
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,510
Yeah, why is this here?

1041
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,450
Oh, the exit is here.

1042
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,050
The exit is here.

1043
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:39,830
Wait, where?

1044
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,790
Right here, below.

1045
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,070
Oh, I can't see jack shit.

1046
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,070
Oh, I see it!

1047
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:45,270
Yeah!

1048
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,010
Okay, I'll bring it up.

1049
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,350
Alright.

1050
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,470
Yeah, I'm doing my part.

1051
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,630
I'm doing my part.

1052
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,230
Okay.

1053
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,650
Me too.

1054
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,830
I'm doing my part.

1055
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,490
Yeah.

1056
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,530
Okay, let's go.

1057
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,010
We're so helpful.

1058
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,650
I don't- No, I can't see.

1059
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,610
Where are you?

1060
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,610
Left side, left side.

1061
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,870
Left side?

1062
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:10,170
Okay.

1063
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,150
Yeah.

1064
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,350
I can't jump.

1065
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,690
I can't.

1066
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,950
My hands are so full.

1067
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,510
Wait, where are you, Ditto?

1068
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,330
I can't see!

1069
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,890
I'm blind!

1070
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,810
Under you!

1071
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,310
Under you!

1072
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:22,770
You're under?

1073
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,570
Okay, okay, okay.

1074
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,310
I'm gonna follow you.

1075
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,710
You're like my dog.

1076
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,670
You know, like blind people with dogs?

1077
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,450
What is the main- What is mantecoy?

1078
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:38,870
It's a bird.

1079
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,570
Oh, okay, that's just a bird.

1080
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,330
Okay, thank god.

1081
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,230
Okay, I was gonna say.

1082
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,570
I thought that was an enemy.

1083
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:44,970
It's your friend.

1084
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,990
Yeah, it's my friend.

1085
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,690
Wait, did I put it in?

1086
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,110
Okay.

1087
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,050
Why is it so fox- Foxy?

1088
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:57,650
Cause like, RPR didn't check the land, and it's- AHHHHH!

1089
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,610
What was that?

1090
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,330
What was that?

1091
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,990
What was that?

1092
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,410
What was that?

1093
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,290
Was that RPR?

1094
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,830
RPR, was that you, you bitch?

1095
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,170
You fucking bitch!

1096
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:08,930
You fucking bitch!

1097
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,590
You fucking let me in!

1098
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,470
You fucking!

1099
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,550
You fucking let me in!

1100
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,510
You fucking!

1101
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,290
Let me in!

1102
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,290
You fucking!

1103
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,670
You fucking!

1104
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,230
You fucking!

1105
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,090
We're leaving, right?

1106
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,790
Get us in!

1107
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:38,330
Then I swear to god, I will yell, and then I swear to god, I swear to god, dogs will come over.

1108
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,650
And then there will be no power, and it will be your fault.

1109
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,970
Dogs will come over, and I hope the fucking ship dies.

1110
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,850
Yes, yes, yes.

1111
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,630
Open the door!

1112
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,010
Oh, we're in!

1113
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,070
Oh, we're in!

1114
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:51,690
Yay!

1115
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,170
Look at that, the laziest employee!

1116
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,350
That's you!

1117
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,450
You got the laziest employee!

1118
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,890
And the most profitable employee.

1119
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,470
Most paranoid, yeah.

1120
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,410
Yeah, yeah.

1121
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,570
Oh, not according to the company, you're the laziest.

1122
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,170
Yeah, because you guys stole my loot!

1123
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,950
We got the loot together.

1124
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:19,610
No!

1125
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,690
Not!

1126
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,570
We were there with you when we got the loot!

1127
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,910
Stop slacking off!

1128
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,850
I brought us the most, I bring us the most money every time.

1129
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:35,670
That's not true.

1130
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,470
Because the last game, we didn't make any money.

1131
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,690
We didn't make any money last game.

1132
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,810
Yeah, but I had the most money on my dead body.

1133
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,670
Yeah, but you were dead.

1134
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,530
That doesn't count.

1135
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,650
You know what?

1136
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,330
We don't need you!

1137
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:51,710
You are this too!

1138
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,070
Ditto and I can do it without you.

1139
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,150
Right, Ditto?

1140
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:55,750
Yeah!

1141
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,730
Okay, we'll go.

1142
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,030
You go in first.

1143
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,170
Let's go, let's go.

1144
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,110
Why me first?

1145
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,730
Okay, because we're a team.

1146
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,290
Okay, okay, listen to me.

1147
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,050
Regular...

1148
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,430
Why me?

1149
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,270
Why me?

1150
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,600
Why was it me?

1151
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm so fucked up!

1152
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,880
I don't fucking want to be now!

1153
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,950
What the fuck?

1154
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,950
Oh, my God!

1155
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,450
Is Ditto dead?

1156
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,090
Is she dead?

1157
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,690
I feel like she's dead!

1158
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,690
Is she not making it?

1159
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,450
Oh, fuck!

1160
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,690
It's the back room!

1161
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,510
I'm not going to check!

1162
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,070
Because I'm waiting to be!

1163
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,650
Oh, fuck!

1164
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,970
Oh, my God!

1165
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,350
There's nothing here!

1166
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,150
Where's...

1167
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,450
She's dead!

1168
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,950
She's actually dead!

1169
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:24,890
Where's the ship?

1170
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,810
Where's the ship?

1171
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,610
I don't remember where the ship is.

1172
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,590
Oh, my God!

1173
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,270
Okay, I need to take her back to the ship!

1174
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,230
I don't know where it is!

1175
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,810
I don't know where it is!

1176
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,090
Oh, fuck!

1177
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,990
I can't believe she's dead!

1178
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,770
I can't believe she's dead!

1179
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,230
Wait, you didn't even leave the ship?

1180
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,250
Wait, you didn't even leave the ship?

1181
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,690
That's so fucked up!

1182
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,630
You didn't even leave the ship!

1183
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,130
What are you doing?

1184
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,230
Wait, you don't need me!

1185
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:04,650
I'm dead!

1186
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,990
I brought the load!

1187
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,650
And there's no loot in your hands!

1188
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,910
But you don't need me, right?

1189
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:10,710
I brought the load!

1190
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,190
I brought her!

1191
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:20,290
You guys don't need me, but she died within three seconds of being out!

1192
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,870
And you throw that...

1193
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,410
She died!

1194
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,510
No, no, no!

1195
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,450
She caused her own death!

1196
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,650
That was not...

1197
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,670
She tried to pick up the fucking...

1198
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,650
I'm going in!

1199
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,210
I'm 1 HP!

1200
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,930
Would it be fucked up if I start the ship while...

1201
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:51,490
Would it be fucked up if I start the ship while he's up there?

1202
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,910
Look, I...

1203
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,790
I did my job!

1204
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,050
Oh, I don't know about you.

1205
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,330
A boat has been cast.

1206
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,270
Okay, I didn't do that though.

1207
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,230
Okay, that's not my fault.

1208
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:06,810
RPR!

1209
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,990
RPR, the boat has been casted!

1210
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:16,510
It's okay.

1211
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,770
That's not my fault.

1212
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,390
That's not my fault.

1213
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,450
Ditto was the one that voted.

1214
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,370
I'm not leaving the ship now that I know.

1215
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,990
Okay, the moment... Okay, guys.

1216
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,850
The moment...

1217
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:37,730
I don't know if he's gonna come back!

1218
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,970
I need to see if he comes back!

1219
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,350
If he comes...

1220
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:51,390
And the moment I see his shadow... like a shadow of him or hear his voice, I'll make sure the ship flies away so he can see the ship flying away before he can get on.

1221
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,850
Wait, check the monitor?

1222
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:57,770
That's me.

1223
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,390
That's me.

1224
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,450
No, he's still alive.

1225
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:02,750
See?

1226
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,010
Oh, I can leave while he's still out there.

1227
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,350
Oh my god, look at him.

1228
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,070
Look, there he is.

1229
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,710
Whose body is that?

1230
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,350
Oh, goodbye.

1231
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,380
Goodbye.

1232
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,280
Oh, man.

1233
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:36,980
What happened?

1234
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,280
Why didn't you just leave me behind, you dumbass?

1235
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,980
I didn't do anything!

1236
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,120
I did not...

1237
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,360
I was bringing loot back!

1238
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,060
I'm too useless fucking dumbass!

1239
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:50,880
I didn't do anything!

1240
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,820
She voted!

1241
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,260
She voted!

1242
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,240
She voted!

1243
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:55,940
What did you do that?

1244
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,660
You're a dumbass!

1245
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,160
I didn't know!

1246
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,960
I didn't know!

1247
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,300
You die, you waste our money, and then you fuck us!

1248
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,760
I didn't know!

1249
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,840
I was just on the ship!

1250
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,100
I didn't do anything!

1251
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,640
I didn't know!

1252
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,580
What is that command?

1253
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,880
Don't click that shit.

1254
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,420
It makes the ship leave.

1255
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,860
Oh, it's I.

1256
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
Okay, okay, okay.

1257
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,500
Okay, alright.

1258
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:33,260
Not only did she die, she costed us money, and then she took the ship away!

1259
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,900
So I died too!

1260
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,240
I was just chilling in the ship.

1261
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,080
I don't know what was going on.

1262
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,580
Why were you hiding the ship?

1263
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,920
Because I was 1 HP!

1264
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,280
Because Zed-O fucking set up the whore next to us!

1265
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,340
I was whoring!

1266
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,560
So we can do this.

1267
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,720
Together, Zed-O.

1268
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,800
We don't need RPR.

1269
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,560
We go this way.

1270
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,000
Okay.

1271
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,540
No, no, no.

1272
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,380
We go this way.

1273
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1274
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,660
We're a team.

1275
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,540
Let's go.

1276
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,660
We don't need RPR.

1277
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,960
Oh, that's a joke.

1278
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,420
Yeah.

1279
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,720
Okay, okay, okay.

1280
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,420
RPR, RPR.

1281
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:20,820
We swap.

1282
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,400
RPR.

1283
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,840
RPR, we're swapping.

1284
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,760
RPR, we can go.

1285
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,400
RPR, we're swapping.

1286
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:26,860
RPR.

1287
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:27,760
RPR.

1288
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,060
Where is he?

1289
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,000
We swap.

1290
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,080
You go the other way.

1291
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,660
There's a turret.

1292
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
You go the other way.

1293
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,940
You're better at that.

1294
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,020
What's that sound?

1295
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,600
Do you hear that?

1296
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,280
What's that?

1297
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,100
Oh, he took the battery!

1298
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,360
Why did you take the battery?

1299
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,220
Oh my god.

1300
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,380
You're chewing the can.

1301
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,160
Why did you take the battery?

1302
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:46,880
We can't see.

1303
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:48,800
Yeah.

1304
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,920
Yeah, how are you gonna split up?

1305
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,740
I lied.

1306
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:52,740
Don't worry.

1307
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,780
We'll bring this back.

1308
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,660
We'll bring this back.

1309
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,960
We're gonna do our job.

1310
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:56,320
Okay, okay.

1311
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,160
I will bring it back to you.

1312
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1313
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:58,960
Don't jump.

1314
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,560
Don't jump.

1315
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,180
Don't jump.

1316
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,420
If we jump, this thing breaks down.

1317
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,320
Oh, I see.

1318
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,080
Alright, nice.

1319
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,960
Okay, where's... Oh, there's the ship.

1320
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,780
Wait, where's the ship?

1321
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,980
Do you remember where the ship is?

1322
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:17,540
Um...

1323
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,520
You wanna go?

1324
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,580
Here, here, here.

1325
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,360
Oh, okay, okay.

1326
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,060
I'm gonna follow you.

1327
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,640
I'm gonna follow you.

1328
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,160
I don't remember.

1329
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,540
You can... you can click... like...

1330
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1331
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1332
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,160
I see it now.

1333
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,360
Look at us go.

1334
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,040
We're such good... we're such good workers.

1335
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:35,960
See?

1336
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,800
We got loot.

1337
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,460
Yeah.

1338
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,800
We got loot for the company.

1339
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,980
Yeah, we're making money.

1340
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:44,880
Alright.

1341
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,420
Okay, I have to go.

1342
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:47,920
I went the wrong way.

1343
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,260
I went the wrong... it's this way.

1344
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,600
It's this way.

1345
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,020
Nice.

1346
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,660
Look at us.

1347
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,040
Money.

1348
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,240
We're team players.

1349
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,360
Okay, let's go.

1350
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,060
Let's go.

1351
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:01,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1352
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,620
We don't need him.

1353
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,260
We don't need him.

1354
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,580
Where's the main entrance?

1355
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,020
I have no idea.

1356
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,500
Wait, where's the... where is the...

1357
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,760
Maybe just... here, here, here.

1358
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,260
Over there.

1359
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:13,660
Over there.

1360
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:13,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1361
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,660
We can go down... let's do the side entrance.

1362
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:17,880
Because he's at main entrance.

1363
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,140
We'll do the side entrance.

1364
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,440
I see.

1365
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:21,980
I see.

1366
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:22,640
Yeah, yeah.

1367
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,340
We'll do the side entrance here.

1368
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,200
Okay.

1369
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,440
We can do this.

1370
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,240
I believe in us.

1371
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,200
We don't need RPR.

1372
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,360
We don't need him.

1373
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,100
Yeah, we can do each game.

1374
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:32,540
Yeah, yeah.

1375
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,900
We're better than him.

1376
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,740
Or two of us.

1377
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,520
Two is better than one.

1378
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:37,780
Yeah, yeah, see?

1379
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,060
Look!

1380
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,780
We have a sign!

1381
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:40,700
Yeah!

1382
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,100
Already!

1383
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,240
Okay, okay, okay.

1384
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,540
Two game.

1385
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,340
Two game.

1386
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:43,780
Two game.

1387
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,040
Two game.

1388
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,240
Oh, we have two weapons!

1389
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,380
Look at that!

1390
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,040
Okay, okay.

1391
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,180
We should kill... we should kill RPR with this.

1392
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,300
Oh, yeah!

1393
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1394
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,040
Before... before... before we take off the shield.

1395
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1396
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1397
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:57,800
No, no.

1398
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,540
Let's go to main entrance.

1399
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,540
We go to the main entrance and we wait for him.

1400
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:03,900
Okay.

1401
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1402
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,300
We wait for him.

1403
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,060
Can... can... where can we... um... go on top?

1404
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:11,940
Woo!

1405
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,140
Yeah, yeah.

1406
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:13,720
We go... he's here.

1407
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,060
He's here.

1408
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,460
This way.

1409
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,040
We go up to the main entrance and we wait for him.

1410
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,140
And then we steal his loot after.

1411
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,540
That's nice.

1412
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,080
Yeah, he won't know.

1413
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,400
He won't know.

1414
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,020
He won't know.

1415
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,420
He'll...

1416
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,240
Look

1417
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,700
at all this loot!

1418
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,440
Okay, okay.

1419
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,160
We will stand... you stand on the other side and then I'll stay.

1420
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:43,460
Okay.

1421
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,380
Nice!

1422
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,280
Nice plan!

1423
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,700
This is such a good plan!

1424
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,300
So good!

1425
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:57,800
Yes!

1426
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,540
Yeah!

1427
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,400
We can just wait here.

1428
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,200
We can just wait here.

1429
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,520
We can't be like you.

1430
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1431
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,060
We're gonna... we're gonna wait for him and then when he comes up we'll be like...

1432
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,920
Yeah, cause... cause fire.

1433
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,660
Cause fire.

1434
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,840
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna steal his money.

1435
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,160
We're gonna steal it.

1436
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,080
He won't be ready for this.

1437
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,740
I think he... he will get back in maybe one hour, one or two hours.

1438
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1439
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,020
He has to.

1440
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,540
He's gonna... he has to cause he has so much loot on him.

1441
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,060
Yup.

1442
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,140
We... we can... we will be able to do this.

1443
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:38,700
We'll be fine.

1444
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,320
Okay.

1445
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,860
Oh, wait, wait.

1446
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,200
What... what if he... he's dead?

1447
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,700
What if he's dead?

1448
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,580
If he's dead...

1449
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,260
Oh, if he's dead he would start the ship.

1450
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,120
He would start the ship if he's dead.

1451
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:53,420
Oh, right.

1452
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,260
Yeah, yeah.

1453
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:54,520
Yeah, yeah.

1454
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,240
There's no way.

1455
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,380
Oh, you're right.

1456
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,600
He would start the ship.

1457
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,220
He would be like, look at these dumbasses.

1458
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,740
And then he's gonna start the ship.

1459
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:00,620
Like...

1460
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,400
Oh, no.

1461
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,280
That makes sense.

1462
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1463
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,480
I don't... I think he's still alive.

1464
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:06,900
He has to be still alive.

1465
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,600
There's no way.

1466
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,560
There's no way.

1467
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,480
He's gonna come through this entrance here.

1468
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,920
We wouldn't hear him.

1469
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,140
If he... if he went through the side entrance we would hear him on the side.

1470
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:17,480
Okay.

1471
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,200
Yeah, don't worry.

1472
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,100
We're ready.

1473
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,580
We're ready for him.

1474
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,000
Look.

1475
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,020
He... he was cocky for too long.

1476
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,740
We were tired of his leadership.

1477
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,300
He's a bad leader, right, Ditto?

1478
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:39,900
Yes.

1479
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,240
He's a bad leader.

1480
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,580
So we have to get rid of him.

1481
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:43,880
He's a bad leader.

1482
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,920
He's a bad leader.

1483
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,460
Oh my god.

1484
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,800
If Uto was here...

1485
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:49,940
If...

1486
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,480
Wait!

1487
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,560
He's dead!

1488
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,140
He died!

1489
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,520
Oh shit, go away!

1490
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,260
You didn't hear that, right?

1491
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,880
Did he hear... do you think he heard that?

1492
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,600
Do you think he heard that?

1493
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,400
No, right?

1494
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,380
He didn't hear all of that, right, guys?

1495
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,540
He didn't.

1496
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,240
No, right guys?

1497
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,720
He didn't hear that.

1498
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,140
It's okay.

1499
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,240
It's okay.

1500
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,780
We're coming back to the ship.

1501
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,260
Wait, where did Ditto go?

1502
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,000
Wait, where the fuck did Ditto go?

1503
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,920
Ditto, where are you?

1504
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,060
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

1505
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,240
I can't align.

1506
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,460
Okay, here, don't worry, we're fine.

1507
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,240
Look at that, we lived!

1508
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,180
We lived.

1509
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,400
Wait, what the fuck was that?

1510
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:58,620
Ditto?

1511
00:50:59,140 --> 00:50:59,740
What is that?

1512
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,460
What is that sound?

1513
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,140
Wait, wait, wait.

1514
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,600
I hear something, I hear.

1515
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,320
What is that sound?

1516
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,780
I hear something!

1517
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,800
Let's go, let's go!

1518
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,740
Let's go, let's go!

1519
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,400
Let's go, let's go!

1520
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,620
Let's go, let's go!

1521
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,320
Oh my god.

1522
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,560
Look, we lived!

1523
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,120
We have loot and we lived!

1524
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,480
The most laziest employee!

1525
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:27,520
Yay!

1526
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,300
Wow!

1527
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,180
So lazy!

1528
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,600
The most laziest employee!

1529
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,460
I know, he's so lazy.

1530
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,760
What happened?

1531
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,400
What happened?

1532
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,040
What happened?

1533
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,700
Why were you so lazy?

1534
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:40,380
Why did you die?

1535
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,020
Why did you die?

1536
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,720
API?

1537
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,640
API?

1538
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,220
API?

1539
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,880
API, why don't you talk to us?

1540
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,260
API, why won't you talk to us?

1541
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,760
Are you mad at us?

1542
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,860
API, why don't you talk to us?

1543
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,780
API, why don't you talk to us?

1544
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,480
API, you don't talk to us, I'm gonna throw our loot off the ship.

1545
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,840
I'm crazy enough to do it, you don't believe me?

1546
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,080
I'm gonna fucking throw this sign off.

1547
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,560
I'm gonna throw this off the clip right now.

1548
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,580
I'm gonna throw this off if you don't talk to us.

1549
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,600
API, why don't you talk to us?

1550
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,420
API, don't do this.

1551
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,040
Don't do this, API.

1552
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,380
Why don't you talk to us?

1553
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,480
Talk to us.

1554
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,720
I'm flying!

1555
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,640
I'm flying!

1556
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:01,960
I'm flying!

1557
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,540
I'm going to

1558
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:08,630
test that.

1559
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:09,610
Test that, I think.

1560
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:10,810
Test that.

1561
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:11,030
Goodbye.

1562
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,310
What?

1563
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:13,730
What the fuck?

1564
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:19,110
Goodbye.

1565
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:22,190
Yay!

1566
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,950
We made money!

1567
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:26,990
We got money!

1568
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,350
Wait, oh wait!

1569
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:33,070
Guys, I don't think we made the money, guys.

1570
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:35,850
Yay, we reached the quota!

1571
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:43,070
I just want you to know, Doki, that when you least expect it, in the darkness of the caves, I'm coming for you.

1572
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,190
What do you mean?

1573
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:45,430
What did I do?

1574
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,750
How did we kill you?

1575
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,510
I'm coming for you.

1576
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,950
We didn't even kill you!

1577
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,370
We were like, alive!

1578
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:58,550
When you least expect it, in the deepest, darkest parts of the dungeons, I'm coming for you.

1579
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,450
What did we do?

1580
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:02,390
We were like, waiting for you.

1581
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,050
Oh, no!

1582
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:08,930
Waiting for me to kill me as I'm carrying 300 plus crap on me, yeah!

1583
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:10,850
You think I didn't see that?

1584
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,470
You think I didn't see all of that?

1585
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,710
And then you leave us!

1586
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,730
You leave me and Vito with all the loot outside the ship!

1587
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,290
So we just lost 500!

1588
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,150
But we made a hundred!

1589
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:23,990
We made the quota!

1590
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,110
Go back to part of me!

1591
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:26,650
I'll play along!

1592
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,990
Oh my god, he's angry!

1593
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:34,690
Why is he so angry?

1594
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:35,410
What do we do?

1595
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,690
Bro, what is wrong with him?

1596
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:39,830
Why is he so angry?

1597
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,350
If Uto was here, he would kill.

1598
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:48,310
No, no.

1599
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,270
But we didn't even do anything!

1600
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:51,590
It was just talking!

1601
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:52,790
Yeah!

1602
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:53,770
We're just talking!

1603
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,730
We're just having a conversation!

1604
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,450
We haven't done anything!

1605
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,130
Yeah, we can't talk now!

1606
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,390
Yeah, what's wrong?

1607
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,290
We can't even talk now?

1608
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:11,470
It's a bird!

1609
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,570
Oh, there's a jump!

1610
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:14,890
You first!

1611
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:16,010
Okay!

1612
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:17,530
I believe in you!

1613
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:19,110
Yes!

1614
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,250
Whoa!

1615
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,130
Okay, my turn!

1616
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:21,770
Woo!

1617
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,430
You did it!

1618
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:24,050
Okay!

1619
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:25,110
There's a door over here!

1620
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:25,710
Yeah!

1621
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1622
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,010
Yay!

1623
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,110
It's not a main entrance!

1624
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:30,050
Let's go!

1625
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:32,350
We don't need him!

1626
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,250
Wait, wait!

1627
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,210
There's a loot!

1628
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:34,470
Loot!

1629
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:35,110
I got loot!

1630
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:38,910
Okay, I already got loot!

1631
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:41,950
I already got his loot!

1632
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:43,850
Okay, nice!

1633
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:44,950
What is this?

1634
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:45,410
What is this?

1635
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:45,810
What is this?

1636
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:46,230
What is that?

1637
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,330
Oh, is it a switch?

1638
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:48,350
It's a switch!

1639
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:51,810
I don't like that!

1640
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:52,450
Oh, we can...

1641
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:53,970
What did you do?

1642
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:55,670
I don't know!

1643
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:56,170
What did you do?

1644
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,590
I don't like that.

1645
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:00,290
What did you do?

1646
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,190
Okay, the light's on.

1647
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,130
Oh, okay, I turned everything on.

1648
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:05,850
Okay.

1649
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:08,990
Here we go.

1650
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,010
Wait, what's that sound?

1651
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:13,930
Are you cursed?

1652
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,610
Wait, he's cursed!

1653
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:17,230
What's that?

1654
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:17,610
What's that?

1655
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,250
That's a cursed item!

1656
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,050
That's a cursed item!

1657
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:21,970
That's a cursed item!

1658
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:22,530
That's a cursed item!

1659
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,270
He's gonna kill us.

1660
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:28,270
I think he's gonna try to kill us.

1661
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:29,290
That's a cursed item!

1662
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,070
What was that item?

1663
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:35,950
So like when you hold onto it, a ghost monster is gonna chase you.

1664
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:38,310
Ahhhh.

1665
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1666
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:40,910
Is that cursed?

1667
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,130
Is that...

1668
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:43,390
Maybe.

1669
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,690
Oh, it's just a toy?

1670
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:46,850
Oh, never mind.

1671
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:47,350
I lied.

1672
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:48,130
I lied.

1673
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,190
It's just a toy.

1674
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:52,270
It's just a toy.

1675
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,130
I lied.

1676
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:56,910
But here, this item!

1677
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,570
Oh look, we found this.

1678
00:56:59,390 --> 00:56:59,870
This.

1679
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:00,550
Yeah.

1680
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:01,610
Nice.

1681
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,190
Go back.

1682
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,490
Yeah, let's go back where we came from.

1683
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:07,550
Because like, our player is gonna do the main room, right?

1684
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:09,070
Yes.

1685
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,570
So we can do this up.

1686
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:14,630
So we can do like the side room.

1687
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,570
We haven't gotten this way yet.

1688
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:18,770
Is this the back room?

1689
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:19,310
Oh, never mind.

1690
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,970
Oh, that's just the back room.

1691
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:22,290
Okay.

1692
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,070
Yeah, yeah, there's nothing there.

1693
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,390
We could go... we could go left.

1694
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,450
We could go here.

1695
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,230
Yeah, go left.

1696
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,190
Oh, there's nothing.

1697
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:33,370
This is so smart!

1698
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,270
But he was here, so we could go this way.

1699
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,050
Okay.

1700
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:39,670
Because he was on the other side.

1701
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:39,950
It's so dark.

1702
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:40,850
I know.

1703
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:43,330
Oh, it's a turret.

1704
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:43,710
Turret.

1705
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:44,010
Turret.

1706
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,190
Okay, we can go this way.

1707
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:47,190
There's not a turret here too.

1708
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:48,910
Oh, there he is.

1709
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:49,210
Hey.

1710
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:50,810
Hey, RPR.

1711
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:51,470
Hey, RPR.

1712
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:51,970
Hey, RPR.

1713
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,590
He ran away.

1714
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:56,630
He's not talking!

1715
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,730
Why is he not talking?

1716
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,190
Yeah, why you don't talk to us?

1717
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,450
Why you don't talk to us?

1718
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:04,730
Yeah, we're good people.

1719
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:06,510
I don't understand.

1720
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,950
We've been so nice to him.

1721
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:13,990
I think he was here.

1722
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,270
He went all the way here because all the doors are open.

1723
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:16,690
Okay.

1724
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:19,070
I don't know where we are now.

1725
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:20,550
Wait, there's a...

1726
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,370
Oh, hey!

1727
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:22,810
Look out!

1728
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:23,370
There's a sloop!

1729
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,070
Wait, why does he hate us all?

1730
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:27,790
He hates me!

1731
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:29,610
What are you doing?

1732
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,040
I'm still in the sloop!

1733
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:35,560
I'm still in the sloop!

1734
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,400
I'm still in the sloop!

1735
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,860
Here, come here!

1736
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,280
I'm still in the sloop!

1737
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,480
He's angry!

1738
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,780
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

1739
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,000
Woo!

1740
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:47,820
Okay.

1741
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,180
Okay.

1742
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,100
Okay.

1743
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:51,940
Okay.

1744
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,080
Okay.

1745
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,260
Okay.

1746
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:55,900
I'm 1 HP.

1747
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,700
I'm 1 HP.

1748
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,380
Okay, okay.

1749
00:58:59,060 --> 00:58:59,900
I'm alive.

1750
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,460
But where do we go?

1751
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,480
I don't know where to go.

1752
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,100
Oh, um...

1753
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,960
We should follow you.

1754
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,860
Maybe this way?

1755
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,540
I'm lost.

1756
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,080
I'm already lost.

1757
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,120
Maybe this way?

1758
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:20,520
Maybe this way?

1759
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,020
To the ship.

1760
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,080
I can't believe it.

1761
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,700
I stole his stuff.

1762
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,420
Let's go to the ship.

1763
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,320
Where's Afio?

1764
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:28,980
Is he dead?

1765
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,240
No, I think he's alive.

1766
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,440
If he was dead, he would start the ship.

1767
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,160
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1768
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,190
Wait,

1769
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,440
I hear...

1770
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,780
I hear you voice, too!

1771
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:23,820
Skinwalker!

1772
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,340
Oh my god.

1773
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,480
We did it!

1774
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,280
Yay!

1775
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,840
Afio is the laziest again!

1776
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,340
Yay!

1777
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:36,880
Yay!

1778
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,340
You literally got me killed.

1779
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,260
How did we...

1780
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:39,960
What did we do?

1781
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:45,160
You made the little dumbass mad.

1782
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,440
Which dumbass?

1783
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,220
Which what?

1784
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,140
The guy that wants to loot.

1785
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,820
Yeah, but like, why did he chase you?

1786
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,300
Just give him a piece of loot!

1787
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,840
Because you guys brought him to me!

1788
01:00:59,180 --> 01:00:59,820
It's unbelievable.

1789
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,100
I believe in karma.

1790
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,120
Karma is coming for you.

1791
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,020
Did you get killed by the bug?

1792
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:07,560
Yeah, he got...

1793
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,880
Look at him, he got killed by a bug.

1794
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:10,080
Look at him, he got...

1795
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:10,680
I can't believe it.

1796
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,380
He got killed by a tiny bug.

1797
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,100
Karma is coming.

1798
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,120
Karma is coming.

1799
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,440
I didn't die.

1800
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,300
What do you mean?

1801
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,380
He got killed by a bug.

1802
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,280
Look at him.

1803
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,220
He got killed by a bug.

1804
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,160
It's our fault, right?

1805
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,500
What did we do?

1806
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,940
I feel like he is getting karma.

1807
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,100
Not us.

1808
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,400
Not us, not us.

1809
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,100
Not us.

1810
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:39,940
We have been good.

1811
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,700
I only died one time.

1812
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,720
He is trying to...

1813
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,580
He is going to revenge us.

1814
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,480
Yeah.

1815
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:47,900
No...

1816
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,240
He can't.

1817
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,800
If he revenges...

1818
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,460
He loses everything.

1819
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,700
Woah, a bottle!

1820
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:55,400
Wait, I got something.

1821
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,280
Oh, you got something?

1822
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:56,900
Oh, nice.

1823
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:57,660
Yep.

1824
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,780
Oh yeah, we're already doing our job.

1825
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,980
Karma doesn't exist for us, because we're good people.

1826
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:06,520
Right?

1827
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,740
Right, Zitto?

1828
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,740
Yes, yes.

1829
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:10,820
It's so dark!

1830
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,180
Yeah, there's nothing in here.

1831
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,540
Oh, I think someone has nothing in there.

1832
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1833
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,700
It's too dark.

1834
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,020
There's nothing in here, too.

1835
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:20,680
I think we have to go to this side.

1836
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,080
It's Day-In!

1837
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,280
Yeah, it's all Day-In.

1838
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:25,900
All Day-In.

1839
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,120
Hello?

1840
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,380
Wait, Day-In's here.

1841
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:31,900
So we have to go up.

1842
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,220
It's Day-In, too!

1843
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, there's something here!

1844
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, Gavin.

1845
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:36,540
Oh, nice!

1846
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:37,680
It's moving.

1847
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:39,720
Look at us!

1848
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,760
We're so efficient!

1849
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,160
We're so good at this.

1850
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,520
Wait, it's all Day-In.

1851
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,320
Day-In!

1852
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,240
Oh, wait.

1853
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:49,960
Oh, where do we go?

1854
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,660
We should go here.

1855
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,140
Is that the Day-In?

1856
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,060
Yeah, that's the Day-In.

1857
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:53,300
It's also Day-In.

1858
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:53,660
Yeah.

1859
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,660
Wait, what?

1860
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,640
This is all Day-In.

1861
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,100
Oh, I guess we go.

1862
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:00,640
Alright.

1863
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:01,600
Okay.

1864
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,960
Okay, we just bring this back.

1865
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:03,600
Take it back to the ship first.

1866
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:03,900
Yeah.

1867
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:06,920
Yay!

1868
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:16,050
RPR has been the laziest employee the most.

1869
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:16,350
Yeah.

1870
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:17,330
Yeah.

1871
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:18,730
We're doing our job.

1872
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:20,750
Keep him busy.

1873
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:21,430
We're not gonna make any profit.

1874
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:22,190
I know.

1875
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:24,610
He's not gonna make any money for the company.

1876
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,750
Oh, he got the battery.

1877
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:27,950
Okay.

1878
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,630
He took the battery again.

1879
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,790
Okay, but wouldn't it be funny if we just start the ship?

1880
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,930
I think he's gonna quit the game.

1881
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:42,430
Okay, but if you do it, he won't.

1882
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,550
Are you sure?

1883
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:45,710
Are you sure?

1884
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,630
Are you sure about that?

1885
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:48,090
Yeah.

1886
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:48,970
Okay.

1887
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:49,970
Okay.

1888
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:50,750
Okay.

1889
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:51,850
He told that.

1890
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:52,550
He told...

1891
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:52,650
Yeah.

1892
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:53,050
No, no, no.

1893
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:53,930
The last time you saved...

1894
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,230
Okay.

1895
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:55,570
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1896
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:56,510
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1897
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:57,670
I think you should do it.

1898
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:58,810
I think...

1899
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:59,450
Is it okay?

1900
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:01,350
If you do it, he won't be mad.

1901
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:01,690
Okay.

1902
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:04,130
I think if you do it, he won't be mad.

1903
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:04,530
Yeah, yeah.

1904
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,350
We have one quarter.

1905
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:09,190
So, this time, it's my turn.

1906
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,350
You guys are insane.

1907
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,310
In the fucking head.

1908
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:16,810
Oh,

1909
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:20,570
it's just...

1910
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:20,730
I think we're gonna have to...

1911
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,030
I didn't do it!

1912
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:38,870
I didn't do it!

1913
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:39,490
It was ditto!

1914
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:42,290
I didn't do it!

1915
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:44,510
I didn't do it!

1916
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,790
I didn't do it!

1917
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:47,750
It was ditto!

1918
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:53,050
I wasn't even the one that did it.

1919
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:55,570
Let's go here.

1920
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,830
I can't believe he was the laziest employee again though.

1921
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,390
Are we gonna make quota?

1922
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:15,510
No, no, no.

1923
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:16,130
We have...

1924
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,490
If you go get the loot, we will.

1925
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,130
Our last time.

1926
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,290
Yeah, we got this.

1927
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,330
We can do this.

1928
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,110
Yeah, we can do it.

1929
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,070
Go fucking make money.

1930
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:25,790
We are making money.

1931
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:27,710
Look at all the stuff we brought in.

1932
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:32,750
I think it's because we keep splitting up.

1933
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,050
If we...

1934
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:34,330
Hello?

1935
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:36,150
Go make money.

1936
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,330
Go make money.

1937
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:37,830
I'm done.

1938
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:39,550
I'll make enough money.

1939
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,410
We made money.

1940
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:42,890
We made money too.

1941
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,170
Go make money.

1942
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:45,950
Go make money.

1943
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:49,910
Wait, why did you take us to the hardest world?

1944
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,310
Why did you take us to the...

1945
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,970
Why did you take us to the...

1946
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:54,050
Go make money.

1947
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,330
I'm done making... I made enough money.

1948
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,330
You guys can make money.

1949
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,690
It's too hard for us.

1950
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:00,790
It's the last day.

1951
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,450
If you guys don't make money, you will lose.

1952
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,270
So go make money.

1953
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,330
I'm not doing anything.

1954
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:05,970
It's the hard world.

1955
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:07,650
We need help.

1956
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:10,730
I'm gonna watch you guys through the cameras here.

1957
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:12,790
Yeah, but we don't have a walkie-talkie.

1958
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,890
Here, I'll buy you walkie-talkies.

1959
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,610
But that's a waste of our money.

1960
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:18,070
We're gonna waste money.

1961
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,430
Here, go pick up walkie-talkies, guys.

1962
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,270
Are you mad at us?

1963
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,250
I'm on a strike.

1964
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:24,970
I don't care.

1965
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:26,230
Are you mad at us?

1966
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,210
What do we do, RPR?

1967
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:28,190
Let's mediate.

1968
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,670
Go make money or we die.

1969
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,350
Go make money or we die.

1970
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:33,690
Go make money or we die.

1971
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:36,590
But where's the walkie-talkie?

1972
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,430
I don't mind dying.

1973
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:41,950
I don't mind dying because I've already been multiple times.

1974
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:45,310
What is... I have no puppy on this mind.

1975
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,910
Wait, where's the walkie-talkie?

1976
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,110
There it is.

1977
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,430
Can I get memory this way?

1978
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,650
But you need the walkie-talkie too, RPR.

1979
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,710
I don't need shit.

1980
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,210
I'll stop right now.

1981
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,820
They're so fucking dead.

1982
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:08,960
You're so fucking dead.

1983
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,040
Shit.

1984
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,080
Where's the end?

1985
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:24,760
Wow.

1986
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:27,780
Wow.

1987
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,280
AHHHHH!

1988
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,080
AHHHHH!

1989
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:29,980
AHHHHH!

1990
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,440
AHHHHH!

1991
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,650
That I'm here.

1992
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,130
That I'm gonna make money.

1993
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,950
I'm gonna make money.

1994
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:06,210
You think he's mad at us?

1995
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:08,530
You think he's mad at us?

1996
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:11,450
Yeah, he's mad at us.

1997
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,870
But what do we do?

1998
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:14,890
But what do we do?

1999
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,230
What do we do?

2000
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:19,090
We need like 50.

2001
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:20,530
We need like 50.

2002
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:22,970
Yeah, why don't we just go to the side entrance.

2003
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,510
Yeah, why don't we just go to the side entrance.

2004
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:25,050
Yeah, yeah.

2005
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,030
I don't know what we did.

2006
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:32,690
We were just like, We're good employees.

2007
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:33,210
What is this?

2008
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:36,230
Is this hard?

2009
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:39,650
How hard?

2010
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:40,810
What's that?

2011
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:44,030
There's a face hugger.

2012
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,070
There's a face hugger.

2013
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:46,850
What is this?

2014
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,970
It's a bag.

2015
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:50,910
Yeah, he like grabs your face.

2016
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:52,910
Okay, okay.

2017
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,390
Oh, oh.

2018
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:56,110
Is this 50?

2019
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,030
Let me see.

2020
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:00,550
Scan.

2021
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:00,790
Scan.

2022
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:02,910
Oh, we need one more.

2023
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:03,870
We need one more item.

2024
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:06,870
We need one more.

2025
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,250
Oh, I found the main entrance.

2026
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:13,750
Okay, okay.

2027
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:15,570
I found one more.

2028
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:16,210
Oh, okay, okay.

2029
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:16,750
We made it.

2030
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:17,110
We made it.

2031
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,060
Ditto?

2032
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:25,640
Ditto?

2033
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:27,720
Ditto?

2034
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,140
Ditto?

2035
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,480
Oh, I think she's dead.

2036
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:38,840
Oh, we made it.

2037
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:39,420
I think she's dead.

2038
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:40,680
Oh.

2039
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,620
I think she's dead.

2040
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:56,760
I think she's dead.

2041
01:09:59,240 --> 01:09:59,840
We have to get out of here.

2042
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:00,500
That sounds awful.

2043
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,440
I don't know how to get home.

2044
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,040
What do we do?

2045
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,100
They're all dead!

2046
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:17,720
They're all dead!

2047
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,440
They're all dead!

2048
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,340
They're all dead!

2049
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,440
They're swinging!

2050
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:21,900
They're swinging!

2051
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,200
They're swinging!

2052
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:23,980
I'm not dead!

2053
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,800
We got money!

2054
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,520
Wait, Ditto crashed.

2055
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,160
Wait, the game crashed.

2056
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,980
The game...

2057
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,230
They crashed the game!

2058
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,820
They crashed the game!

2059
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,860
What the fuck?

2060
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,600
Oh my god!

2061
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,120
Bro, it was lagging so hard!

2062
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,100
I've seen Ditto like running in the...

2063
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,780
in the stall, standing still.

2064
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,300
We did it, RPR!

2065
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:14,160
We did it!

2066
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,140
All you got was two pieces of loot.

2067
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,300
We did it!

2068
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,940
We made quota!

2069
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,680
Yeah, we made quota!

2070
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,180
Do I need to remind you that you murdered me?

2071
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:26,980
Lazy as a pony!

2072
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:32,440
You murdered me multiple times while I was carrying hundreds of thousands of scrap!

2073
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,120
Okay, you dying is not murder.

2074
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,200
Yeah!

2075
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,620
You leaving me on the planet is not murder.

2076
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,460
We didn't do anything.

2077
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,380
You leaving me...

2078
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:47,740
Let me put this into perspective.

2079
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,980
Put this into perspective, okay?

2080
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:56,680
You guys left me on the planet three times already while I was carrying loot.

2081
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:03,260
And then one time I go inside and you guys actually find loot, which are stop signs.

2082
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:19,200
I accidentally die with four pieces of loot, a lot of money on me, and I spectate you guys, planning to kill me as I walk through the door, carrying the loot to save you guys from the fucking company!

2083
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,740
But it was just talk!

2084
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,180
We didn't do it!

2085
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,060
We didn't do it!

2086
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,380
Yeah, we didn't do it!

2087
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,380
We were just talking!

2088
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,600
Do you think that we are gonna do that to you?

2089
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,980
Yeah, we were just talking!

2090
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,220
There's no way we're gonna do that to you!

2091
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,800
It was just a fantasy!

2092
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,680
We were just talking!

2093
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,420
There's no way we can do that!

2094
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,540
Yeah, why would we do that to you?

2095
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,160
Yeah, why would we do that to you?

2096
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,100
You had so much money!

2097
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:49,660
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

2098
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,520
We need 70 more!

2099
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,960
I got a key!

2100
01:12:59,020 --> 01:12:59,580
I got a key!

2101
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,160
No, don't sell keys!

2102
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:02,960
Don't sell keys!

2103
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,460
Why not?

2104
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,540
But we need more money!

2105
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,800
We have enough money!

2106
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Okay, okay!

2107
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,640
Look, we did it!

2108
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:12,800
It's over!

2109
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:13,420
We lost!

2110
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:14,140
Wait, what?

2111
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,720
I thought you said we had enough!

2112
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,560
Vito, you're carrying!

2113
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,440
You're carrying!

2114
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:18,620
Here, here, here!

2115
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,880
I will sell everything!

2116
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,760
I will sell the key!

2117
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:23,420
I will sell everything!

2118
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,180
Is that 40?

2119
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,500
That's 10 dollars!

2120
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,000
That's 24!

2121
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:30,980
We lost!

2122
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,360
No, no, I have a key!

2123
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:35,220
That key is 3!

2124
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,500
We have a key!

2125
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,220
We did it!

2126
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,640
We will use the corner!

2127
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:39,620
Yeah!

2128
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,540
Wait, there's a coffee mug!

2129
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2130
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,000
See?

2131
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,380
I told you!

2132
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,300
The key works!

2133
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,640
Yeah, we did it!

2134
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,480
We did it!

2135
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:56,660
See?

2136
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:56,780
We did it!

2137
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:56,780
See?

2138
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,100
You're lucky!

2139
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,060
We did it!

2140
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,500
I found the coffee mug!

2141
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,680
I found that coffee mug!

2142
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,120
I found that coffee mug!

2143
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:05,740
Nice, nice!

2144
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,060
I'm selling it!

2145
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,180
Oh, I saved the day!

2146
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,240
I'm selling it!

2147
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,300
Yippee!

2148
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,220
You have a coffee mug!

2149
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,480
Shut the fuck up!

2150
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:26,000
It would have literally had 3000 scrap right now if you guys didn't kill me!

2151
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,560
Look, we didn't do anything!

2152
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,560
You killed yourself!

2153
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:31,660
Yeah!

2154
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,700
You're crazy!

2155
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,160
You guys are crazy!

2156
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:37,260
You guys are literally plotting against us!

2157
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:37,740
No, no, no!

2158
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,460
We are the same team!

2159
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,620
If Uto was here, if Uto was here, Yeah!

2160
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,280
you wouldn't be yelling at us!

2161
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:44,860
Like this!

2162
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,420
Yes, I would!

2163
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,360
We're on the same fucking team!

2164
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,460
Yeah, so why are you so mean to us?

2165
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,400
Are you crazy in the head?

2166
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:00,980
Like, hello?

2167
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,440
Have you been here the past hour with me?

2168
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,460
I'm playing solo!

2169
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,420
We helped!

2170
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,940
We got the coffee mug!

2171
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,220
Right, Tito?

2172
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,640
We got the coffee mug that got us the quota!

2173
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:19,780
Yeah!

2174
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,360
Make money!

2175
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,300
More money, less talking!

2176
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,520
We need walkie-talkies!

2177
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,000
I want walkie-talkies!

2178
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:31,960
I'm gonna buy stuff!

2179
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,280
Alright, you wanna buy stuff?

2180
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,120
I'm gonna buy stuff.

2181
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,840
Help, store.

2182
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,120
Well, I'm gonna buy something that won't be a waste of money!

2183
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:46,620
I'm gonna buy stuff!

2184
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:47,860
Oh my god!

2185
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,540
What are you gonna buy?

2186
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,960
I'm gonna buy this.

2187
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,880
Walkie-talkie?

2188
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,020
I did it.

2189
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,520
I bought something.

2190
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:58,360
Nice.

2191
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,500
Don't worry, I bought something useful.

2192
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,480
Let's wait for the...

2193
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,240
Let's wait for the package.

2194
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:12,640
Oh my god, he go by himself!

2195
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,860
He go alone again.

2196
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,540
Don't worry, don't worry.

2197
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,760
If he die, he's gonna blame all of us.

2198
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,760
Yeah, he's gonna blame us if he dies.

2199
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:19,760
But it's not our fault.

2200
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:20,440
We didn't do anything.

2201
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,760
Yeah, we're shopping.

2202
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,960
Look, look what I got!

2203
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:26,460
What is this?

2204
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,460
How much?

2205
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,260
Did you buy things?

2206
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,900
Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

2207
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:37,880
Look.

2208
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:39,660
Look.

2209
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,380
Here, here.

2210
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,240
I'm just gonna...

2211
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,340
No, no, this is a good purchase!

2212
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,000
It's a good purchase!

2213
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,240
It's like motivation losing.

2214
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:50,740
Look.

2215
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,220
Nice one, nice one.

2216
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:55,800
Nice one, nice one.

2217
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,180
It's good money!

2218
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,260
Okay, wait, wait.

2219
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,420
I'll buy something else.

2220
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,320
Let's see.

2221
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:02,720
Store.

2222
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,420
We can buy...

2223

We'll buy two.

2225
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,360

01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,000
I have never seen toilet!

2233
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,260
Yeah, yeah, we can use this as bathroom things.

2234
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,520
We can buy a toilet!

2235
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:32,960
It's needed.

2236

Okay, okay.

2239
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,740
We don't tell him.

2240
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:40,000
Shh!

2241
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,500
Wait, is it inside?

2242
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,780

01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:54,900
It's here!

2247
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,500
Oh my god, toilet!

How do I use this?

2267
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,060
Okay.

2268
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:43,860
Hello?

2269
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,000
Hello?

2270
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,900
Yeah, I can hear you.

2271
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:50,200
Hello?

01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,440
Where's the entrance?

2276
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,320
Let's go.

2277
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:00,820

Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2282
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,680
See, we're being so...

2283
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:06,940
Careful!

2284
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,700
It's a flag.

2285
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:09,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2286
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,920
You can die from that.

2287
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,760
Yeah, I have every...

2288
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,860

01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:16,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2290
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,940
This is expensive walkie-talkie.

2291
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2292
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:20,500
This is expensive walkie-talkie.

2293
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,160
How much?

2294
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:21,920
How much?

2295
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,680
It was like $20.

2296
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:24,180
It was like $20.

2297
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:26,420
Where's the entrance?

2298
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,720
Oh, there, there, there, there, there!

2299
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,260
I see it, I see it, I see it.

2300
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,100
Okay, let's go.

2301
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,700
We have walkie-talkies now.

2302
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,400
Oh, there's a lot of stuff!

2303
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,720
There's a lot of stuff.

2304
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:36,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2305
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:37,540
Oh my god, that's a lot of stuff.

2306
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:38,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2307
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,460
Hello, do you hear me?

2308
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:41,800
Okay, okay.

2309
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,340
We're taking bags.

2310
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:47,880
We're taking bags?

2311
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2312
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,040
We're taking bags.

2313
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:51,740
Okay, okay.

2314
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:52,260
Look at us.

2315
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:52,800
Okay.

2316
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,300
With this, we can make a lot of money.

2317
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,280
Yeah, yeah, we can...

2318
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:56,800
We did it.

2319
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,140
We're doing our part.

2320
01:19:59,340 --> 01:19:59,860
Yes.

2321
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:00,640
Yeah.

2322
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:02,300
Look at us go.

2323
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,480
We're so helpful!

2324
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,820
We're making money!

2325
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:13,830
Okay, I'm 1 HP.

2326
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:14,190
Why?

2327
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:15,210
I'm 1 HP.

2328
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:16,650
Oh, me too.

2329
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:18,290
Me too.

2330
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,270
Okay, we shouldn't...

2331
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:21,510
I think we can come from this.

2332
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:22,370
This way, this way.

2333
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:24,810
I don't think we should go inside.

2334
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,010
We're 1 HP.

2335
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:27,130
We did our part.

2336
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:28,070
We...

2337
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:31,050
I have to wait for this sign.

2338
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:33,090
Alright.

2339
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:34,050
Wait, where's the ship?

2340
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:36,790
Do you know where the ship is?

2341
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:38,510
I never know where the ship is.

2342
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:40,550
Maybe on our left side?

2343
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:41,670
Oh, okay.

2344
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,010
Oh, I see it!

2345
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:43,310
I see it!

2346
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:44,870
Yeah, I scanned it.

2347
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:45,110
Which one?

2348
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,050
Oh, okay, okay.

2349
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:47,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2350
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:47,570
It's this way.

2351
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,030
I think?

2352
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,330
Okay, no, I don't.

2353
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:52,170
I don't see it.

2354
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:52,670
I'm lost.

2355
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:54,190
Oh.

2356
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:55,330
I'm lost.

2357
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:56,970
Did you lie?

2358
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:58,510
No, I didn't lie.

2359
01:20:58,750 --> 01:20:59,550
I'm just stupid.

2360
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:00,850
Where's the ship?

2361
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:01,510
Oh, I see it!

2362
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:02,090
I see it!

2363
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:02,410
I see it!

2364
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,690
You're just stupid!

2365
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:06,650
No!

2366
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:08,630
You can be stupid!

2367
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:10,650
Only up here stupid is enough, okay?

2368
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:12,690
Okay.

2369
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:15,530
Maybe we can all be...

2370
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:15,730
You can be more stupid.

2371
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:17,350
Okay, I'm stupid, but not that stupid.

2372
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:18,770
Okay.

2373
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,330
Only up here...

2374
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:23,010
is enough.

2375
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:23,690
Yay!

2376
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,410
We made money!

2377
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,410
Wait, where's our boombox?

2378
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:31,610
Wait, where does our music box go?

2379
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:32,530
Oh, I have it!

2380
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:33,210
Wait!

2381
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:34,430
Okay, okay.

2382
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,270
Is up here dead?

2383
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:37,330
Is he?

2384
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:38,470
Oh, no!

2385
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:39,230
He's dead!

2386
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:40,230
Wait, is he dead?

2387
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,550
No, maybe he's hiding.

2388
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:44,670
Is he hiding?

2389
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:46,870
I think he's dead.

2390
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,790
No, no, he has to be hiding.

2391
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:50,990
He doesn't move.

2392
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,370
Wait, how do I... where's my walkie-talkie?

2393
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,210
Did I drop it?

2394
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:56,710
Where's my walkie-talkie?

2395
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:01,750
I'm gonna go back again.

2396
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:03,510
Where's my walkie-talkie though?

2397
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:07,070
Oh, we should give him a little...

2398
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:07,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2399
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:09,590
Yeah, maybe.

2400
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:11,670
Maybe we should all go back.

2401
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:12,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2402
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,110
We should go back and get the loot.

2403
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:19,370
Oh, my... oh, where's my walkie-talkie?

2404
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:20,750
This way, this way.

2405
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:24,270
I think I dropped it when we fell.

2406
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:26,510
Okay.

2407
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:27,970
I think it's...

2408
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:29,130
Is it this way?

2409
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:29,470
You following?

2410
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:32,290
I don't know how to get back.

2411
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:34,670
This way, this way.

2412
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:35,410
Okay, okay, okay.

2413
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:36,750
I follow you.

2414
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:38,690
I'm already lost.

2415
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:41,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2416
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:42,130
This way?

2417
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:46,130
I think you dropped it at the main entrance.

2418
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:46,870
Oh, maybe.

2419
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:47,850
Yeah, I think so.

2420
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:49,170
When I was picking stuff up, yeah.

2421
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,250
Okay, we have...

2422
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:57,050
Oh,

2423
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:02,740
my gosh.

2424
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,760
I hear... I hear... I hear Doki's voice.

2425
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,660
I hear your voice!

2426
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,560
There's my walkie-talkie!

2427
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,180
Walkie-talkie!

2428
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,640
Why is she talking to you?

2429
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,580
Grab it, grab it, grab it.

2430
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:22,240
I got this.

2431
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,120
Okay, okay.

2432
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,220
Go back.

2433
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,660
Hey, hey, hey.

2434
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,320
Wait!

2435
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,540
It's dark now, so there's a lot of monsters outside.

2436
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:38,060
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

2437
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:38,180
Yeah.

2438
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,440
Don't worry.

2439
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:41,780
I have this.

2440
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,040
What the f...

2441
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,020
I don't know where to go.

2442
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,480
Maybe this way.

2443
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,080
Okay.

2444
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:07,670
Oh, there's...

2445
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:09,250
That's me, that's me.

2446
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:11,310
Oh, I see it, I see it.

2447
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:15,560
Oh.

2448
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:16,220
Oh, shh.

2449
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,520
Oh, shh, shh.

2450
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,680
Oh, shh, shh.

2451
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,300
Oh, no!

2452
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:36,560
Yeah!

2453
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:37,740
No!

2454
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,040
No!

2455
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,940
Dad, we're all dead!

2456
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,300
We're all dead!

2457
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,310
Are you dead?

2458
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:51,550
You dead?

2459
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:55,410
Karma has come out and bit you in the ass once again.

2460
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,110
What the f...

2461
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:57,470
What the f...

2462
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:01,050
What the f...

2463
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:06,710
I literally made so much money that run and you guys are f***ing around with walkie-talkies and that's why we...

2464
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:08,050
What do you mean?

2465
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,670
I made like over 400 in that run.

2466
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:12,230
No, but we...

2467
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:17,730
Just to watch you guys f*** with a toilet and f*** walkie-talkies.

2468
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:19,530
But f*** this toilet.

2469
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:20,450
No!

2470
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,970
What happened to our toilet?

2471
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,610
What is your toilet?

2472
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:26,690
What is your toilet?

2473
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:28,930
It's so hard.

2474
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:32,530
What happened to our toilet?

2475
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,110
F*** your toilet.

2476
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,870
I believe in it.

2477
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,310
You deleted the toilet!

2478
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:38,030
Do we get our money back?

2479
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:41,590
Do we get our toilet money back?

2480
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:42,830
Oh my god.

2481
01:25:42,990 --> 01:25:43,350
No!

2482
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:48,590
You guys don't get to have fun until we make money in this f***ing house!

2483
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:49,850
But we...

2484
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:51,590
We did make money!

2485
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,050
But you made zero!

2486
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:53,710
You all died!

2487
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:55,090
We were!

2488
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:56,430
Our toilet!

2489
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:58,670
Our toilet!

2490
01:25:59,290 --> 01:25:59,590
Our toilet!

2491
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:00,790
We worked so hard!

2492
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:03,330
Did he delete it?

2493
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:05,130
No, it's in storage.

2494
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:08,690
I bought us walkie-talkies!

2495
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:10,310
I bought us walkie-talkies!

2496
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:11,290
So we can use it.

2497
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:12,710
Okay.

2498
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:17,190
I couldn't buy us a boombox.

2499
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:18,730
We were broke.

2500
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:20,290
We didn't have enough.

2501
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:20,750
We didn't have money.

2502
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:25,670
It's in his storage.

2503
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:26,930
He kept it.

2504
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:28,830
Our walkie-talkie!

2505
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:30,430
Nice, nice!

2506
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:34,870
Oh, here!

2507
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:36,190
Where is it?

2508
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:37,750
Oh, there it is.

2509
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:39,270
Yay!

2510
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:40,910
Where's the other one?

2511
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:41,790
Oh, there it is.

2512
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:42,110
Yay!

2513
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:43,950
Alright, let's do it.

2514
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:45,090
Let's make money.

2515
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,410
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2516
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:46,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2517
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:47,850
We have walkie-talkies.

2518
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:51,710
We're gonna make some money.

2519
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:53,570
Yay!

2520
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:56,690
How do we get up?

2521
01:26:58,990 --> 01:26:59,470
Ummm...

2522
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:02,010
We have to go another way.

2523
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:05,750
Why does he always split up with us?

2524
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:06,270
Why does he always split up with us?

2525
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:08,110
Why doesn't he wanna work with us?

2526
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:09,390
Oh, here, here, here, here, here.

2527
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:11,270
I don't understand.

2528
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:13,250
We're like a team, right?

2529
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:16,750
Yeah, he always go alone, right?

2530
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:18,810
Yeah, why does he always go alone?

2531
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:22,870
If he stops going alone, then we wouldn't die.

2532
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:28,210
There's no point to play with cheap people if he runs off.

2533
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:28,690
There's no point to play with cheap people if he runs off.

2534
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:28,910
Yeah, yeah.

2535
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:31,530
If he's in a solo, no wonder he keeps dying.

2536
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:35,870
If he had us with him, he wouldn't be dying.

2537
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:36,330
If he had us with him, he wouldn't be dying.

2538
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:39,430
We're trying to be a team player.

2539
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:40,510
Let's find him.

2540
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,010
Let's try to find him.

2541
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:45,270
RPR!

2542
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:47,490
RPR!

2543
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:48,210
What's that?

2544
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:49,470
Oh, that's a slum.

2545
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:50,130
That's a slum.

2546
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:50,610
What is that?

2547
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:51,330
What happened?

2548
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:52,810
It's a slum.

2549
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:53,930
Does it kill you?

2550
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,530
Yeah, it kills you.

2551
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:57,530
Yeah, walk into it.

2552
01:27:57,570 --> 01:27:58,110
Let's see what happens.

2553
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,670
No, I think it kills you, right?

2554
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:02,230
It's gonna kill us.

2555
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:02,990
No, it's okay.

2556
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:03,290
We...

2557
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:04,170
Something is gonna kill you.

2558
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:05,510
Something is gonna kill you anyway.

2559
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:07,610
No, we have to work together.

2560
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:08,790
We make a line.

2561
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,070
RPR, we have to work together.

2562
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:13,670
As a team.

2563
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:18,730
We can work together.

2564
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:22,230
We have...

2565
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:23,190
I'm gonna die?

2566
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:24,850
I think he's gonna die.

2567
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:25,250
Isn't he?

2568
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:30,350
Where did he go?

2569
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:31,090
Oh, he's over there.

2570
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:33,350
Okay.

2571
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,490
Go get the loot while I'm dealing with this slum shit.

2572
01:28:35,490 --> 01:28:36,870
But we wanna work with you.

2573
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:38,890
I can't move!

2574
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,450
There's a slime in front of me!

2575
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:41,050
Go get the loot!

2576
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,110
Okay, we'll get the loot.

2577
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:45,950
Okay, okay.

2578
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:47,330
Okay, I got loot.

2579
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:47,890
Look.

2580
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:48,370
I saw you.

2581
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:49,730
You got GG loss.

2582
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:50,550
I got loot.

2583
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:51,150
I got loot.

2584
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:51,390
Look.

2585
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:51,710
See?

2586
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:52,910
I got loot.

2587
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:54,130
Yeah, bring it out the door.

2588
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:58,850
I did it!

2589
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:01,630
Okay, I'll go this side.

2590
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:03,530
Okay.

2591
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:06,490
Oh, I got more...

2592
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:07,850
The slime is mad at you.

2593
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:08,670
This time you will die.

2594
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:10,090
Oh!

2595
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:11,990
There's a bug!

2596
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:16,430
What do I do?

2597
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:21,110
He's

2598
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:26,550
dead!

2599
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:27,010
He's dead!

2600
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:27,710
He's dead!

2601
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:28,190
He's dead!

2602
01:29:28,190 --> 01:29:28,970
Oh my god, he's dead!

2603
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:29,870
He's dead!

2604
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:30,910
He's dead!

2605
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:30,950
He's dead!

2606
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:31,790
He's dead!

2607
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:31,930
I saw it!

2608
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:32,390
I saw it!

2609
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:33,530
Yes, he's dead!

2610
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:34,490
He's dead!

2611
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:35,290
I took...

2612
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:36,610
Yes, he's dead!

2613
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:37,490
Okay, okay, okay.

2614
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:38,650
I didn't do anything!

2615
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:39,230
I didn't!

2616
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:39,770
I took this stuff.

2617
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:40,590
He's dead!

2618
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:41,590
He's dead!

2619
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:42,970
Oh my god, oh my god!

2620
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:45,290
Let's go!

2621
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:45,950
Let's go back!

2622
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:46,490
He's dead!

2623
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:46,770
He's dead!

2624
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:48,430
He's dead!

2625
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:49,950
Where did we go?

2626
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:53,450
What's this monster?

2627
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:55,130
Oh, I don't know!

2628
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:56,070
I don't know!

2629
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:57,110
How do we get home?

2630
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:58,910
How do we get home?

2631
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:02,370
He's dead again!

2632
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:05,290
Wait, where's our ship?

2633
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:09,770
I don't know where the ship is!

2634
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:12,410
I always relied on you.

2635
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:15,550
What happened?

2636
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:16,590
What happened inside?

2637
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:17,250
I don't know!

2638
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:18,410
I don't know!

2639
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:21,610
He just... There was just so many things happening!

2640
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:23,170
I don't know what happened!

2641
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:25,670
I'm dying!

2642
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:28,850
This way, this way, this way!

2643
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:29,990
Okay, okay, okay.

2644
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:31,770
It's okay.

2645
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:34,870
I took his load.

2646
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,770
Oh my god.

2647
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:38,690
Wait, where's home?

2648
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:40,530
Where's home?

2649
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:42,450
Oh, here, here.

2650
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:44,170
I can't remember.

2651
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:45,130
This way.

2652
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:46,770
Okay, okay, okay.

2653
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,430
I don't know what happened.

2654
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:52,770
There were so many monsters!

2655
01:30:54,670 --> 01:30:55,150
Yeah!

2656
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:58,210
There were so many monsters and then he died!

2657
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:01,530
Why he die?

2658
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:03,310
He did again.

2659
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:04,710
I don't know!

2660
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,710
I don't know how he died this time!

2661
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:09,390
Oh, there he is.

2662
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:09,850
There he is.

2663
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:12,210
He died every time.

2664
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:12,710
I know!

2665
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,290
He's the laziest employee!

2666
01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:18,210
Okay.

2667
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:19,390
Nice.

2668
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:21,570
He's dead in two days.

2669
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:23,530
Oh yeah, I think he's dead.

2670
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:23,950
Look.

2671
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:26,170
Yeah, he's dead.

2672
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:27,210
Look, look.

2673
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:27,470
See?

2674
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:29,450
I saw he got eaten.

2675
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:31,050
You saw him get eaten?

2676
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:32,290
By what?

2677
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:32,710
Yeah!

2678
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:34,710
By the monster!

2679
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:35,330
The monster!

2680
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:35,790
Oh my god!

2681
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:37,830
Okay, then we go, I guess.

2682
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:40,570
I guess we have to go now.

2683
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:41,970
Oh, how much?

2684
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:42,890
How many?

2685
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:44,230
How much money we have?

2686
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:45,330
Not a lot.

2687
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:46,650
We made $79.

2688
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,450
But we have to go.

2689
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:49,090
Okay.

2690
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:53,750
Okay.

2691
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:54,890
Go next.

2692
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:55,490
We go next.

2693
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:56,410
Yeah, we go next.

2694
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:56,790
This next.

2695
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:57,950
We have walkie-talkies now!

2696
01:31:58,010 --> 01:31:59,310
We give one to RPR!

2697
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,070
Okay, yeah.

2698
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:02,610
Yeah, we give... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2699
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:03,730
Give one to RPR.

2700
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:04,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2701
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:07,410
Give one to him.

2702
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:10,770
Oh my god, he's... he's employee.

2703
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,200
How did you die?

2704
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,680
Don't talk to me.

2705
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:18,880
How did you die?

2706
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,000
How did you die?

2707
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:24,760
You literally brought the whole army of monsters to me.

2708
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:26,060
What do you mean how I died?

2709
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,660
I was so scared.

2710
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,740
I was trying to get out.

2711
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,380
Yeah, you got out.

2712
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:33,600
That's the expense of my life.

2713
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,640
But you could have got out too.

2714
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,300
Up here, here, here.

2715
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:36,960
Take my walkie.

2716
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:37,840
We're gonna help you.

2717
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,360
Take the walkie-talkie.

2718
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:40,520
Take the walkie-talkie.

2719
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:41,620
What do you mean you're gonna help me?

2720
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:42,020
You're going in there and you're making money.

2721
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:42,600
We'll guide you.

2722
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:43,040
No, no.

2723
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:43,840
We'll guide you.

2724
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:44,980
We're gonna take the walkie-talkie.

2725
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:45,720
You're not guiding me for shit.

2726
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:46,120
No, no, no.

2727
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:46,940
I'm good at this.

2728
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:47,940
You can... No.

2729
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,860
Walkie-talkie is a waste of space and we need all the money we can fucking...

2730
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:55,280
Yeah, but I can help you find the monsters so you won't get hurt.

2731
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:57,620
I don't need your help.

2732
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,780
But you died like twice because of the monsters.

2733
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:02,040
You're gonna help Ditto.

2734
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:02,760
She needs help.

2735
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:03,320
Okay, okay, Ditto.

2736
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,100
You go inside.

2737
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:05,560
I'll use the walkie-talkie.

2738
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:05,860
Okay?

2739
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,060
Charge your walkie-talkie.

2740
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,200
No, no, no.

2741
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,900
You should go inside.

2742
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:07,920
Why are you doing this?

2743
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:08,520
No, no, no.

2744
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,460
I'm good at this.

2745
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,060
Go skating.

2746
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:10,680
Go skating.

2747
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:10,680
Go skating.

2748
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,340
No, no, no.

2749
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:15,060
No, but I can look at the map and I'll tell you there's monsters, Ditto.

2750
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:17,760
Okay, I'll do... I'll do this.

2751
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:19,800
I'll do the... I'll go out the next day.

2752
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,860
The next day you guide me but today I guide you, okay?

2753
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:24,760
Okay, okay, okay.

2754
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:25,660
Okay, okay, okay.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2757
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:28,720
Alright, alright.

2758
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:28,980
Ready?

2759
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:30,680
I'm ready.

2760
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,480
I'm... Okay.

2761
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,160
Alright.

2762
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:33,260
I'll give you the main intent.

2763
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2764
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,840
I'll tell you if there's monsters.

2765
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:37,840
Okay, okay.

2766
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,180
Okay, okay.

2767
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:41,280
I believe in you, Ditto.

2768
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,080
Yeah, I believe in you too.

2769
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,040
Yeah, yeah.

2770
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,060
I won't let you die.

2771
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,220
I hope you won't lie to me.

2772
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,280
Don't worry.

2773
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,100
I won't let you die.

2774
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,100
Okay, okay.

2775
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,280
I saw the bee.

2776
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,300
Don't get the bee.

2777
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,280
Don't get the bee.

2778
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:56,520
Okay.

2779
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:07,080
I don't understand why he's so... He's so mad.

2780
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:09,280
Wait, there's something to your left.

2781
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:12,420
There's loot.

2782
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:13,680
Is there any monster?

2783
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:14,780
No, no monsters.

2784
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:15,400
No monsters.

2785
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,280
I'll let you know there's monsters.

2786
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:21,480
There's a lot of loot though.

2787
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:23,360
Fine.

2788
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,160
Okay.

2789
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,140
I'm watching.

2790
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:31,760
No monsters.

2791
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:32,500
No loot.

2792
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:32,940
No loot.

2793
01:34:39,230 --> 01:34:40,090
Where is the loot?

2794
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:41,070
No loot.

2795
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:44,890
No loot or monsters.

2796
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,630
Is there any monster?

2797
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:50,810
No, no, no.

2798
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:52,250
No monsters.

2799
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:53,630
See?

2800
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:54,790
I'm doing so well.

2801
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:56,510
I'm such a team player.

2802
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:03,960
I'm helping.

2803
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,700
I'm useful.

2804
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:07,100
No monsters.

2805
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:07,680
No loot.

2806
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,200
Nice, nice.

2807
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:15,700
There you go.

2808
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,020
I opened door.

2809
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:18,660
Okay.

2810
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:19,380
This here?

2811
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,500
Yeah, yeah.

2812
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:21,180
No monsters.

2813
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:21,800
No loot.

2814
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,420
Wait, what number is that?

2815
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,000
You're fine.

2816
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:28,500
You're fine.

2817
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:32,200
Which way?

2818
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,120
Which way should we go?

2819
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:34,760
Follow RPR.

2820
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:35,360

01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,340
Oh, there's loot.

2822
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:37,180
There's loot to your left.

2823
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:40,520
Okay, okay.

2824
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:40,680
I got it.

2825
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:40,900
There's loot.

2826
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:41,480
There's loot there.

2827
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:41,820
There's loot.

2828
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:43,840
Okay, okay.

2829
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:43,840
I got it.

2830
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,200
Look at me.

2831
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,360
I'm so good.

2832
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:49,500
I'm so good at this game.

2833
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:52,360
Dead end.

2834
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:52,740
Dead end.

2835
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,120
Yeah, there's loot there.

2836
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,200

There's loot.

2839
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:05,720
Wait, what is that?

2840
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,320
I'm such a team player.

2841
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,000
Oh, I lied.

2842
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:10,660
No loot.

2843
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,560

There's no monsters.

2846
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:28,670
You're perfectly healthy.

2847
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:30,630
Oh, upstairs loot.

2848
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:31,370
Upstairs loot.

2849
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:36,130
See?

2850
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:37,230
Look at that.

2851
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:42,590
I'm so fucking good at this game.

2852
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:45,590
Is there anything downstairs?

2853
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:45,970
No.

2854
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:47,930
I'm so lost looking at this.

2855
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:50,430
Oh, loot in center.

2856
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:51,290
Loot there.

2857
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:51,710
Loot there.

2858
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:53,790
Go forward.

2859
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:54,330
Go forward.

2860
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:58,210
Top.

2861
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:58,850
Top loot.

2862
01:36:58,950 --> 01:36:59,370
Top loot.

2863
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:00,910
Forward.

2864
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:01,450
Forward.

2865
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:01,870
Forward.

2866
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:03,410

Oh, loot right.

2869
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:08,570
Right side.

2870
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:09,270
Right side loot.

2871
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:10,610
Go back.

2872
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:10,990
Go back.

2873
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:12,130
Go back.

2874
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:14,930
Go back.

2875
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:15,270
Ditto.

2876
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:16,170
Loot.

2877
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:19,070
Wait, did she drop the walkie talkie?

2878
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:21,130
She can't even hear me.

2879
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:22,230
I just realized.

2880
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:29,910
I just realized she can't even hear me because she doesn't have her walkie talkie out.

2881
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:31,430
I just realized.

2882
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:38,710
Can you hear me now?

2883
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:46,370
Yeah, I can hear you.

2884
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:46,690
I can hear you.

2885
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:48,110
Okay, okay, okay.

2886
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:51,090
We need more.

2887
01:37:51,150 --> 01:37:52,030
Like, we need more.

2888
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:52,550
Like, 200.

2889
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:53,510
Wait, wait.

2890
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:54,550
There's loot to your...

2891
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:54,870
Wait.

2892
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:56,070
Where are you?

2893
01:37:57,190 --> 01:37:58,150
Bring the loot.

2894
01:37:58,270 --> 01:37:59,590
I'll come over and bring loot back.

2895
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:00,250
I'll come over.

2896
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:02,170
Okay, okay.

2897
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:05,230
Where am I?

2898
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:09,410
I don't know where the entrance is.

2899
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:11,550
It's not made in time.

2900
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:12,470
Oh.

2901
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:14,590
Where am I?

2902
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:16,110
Is this...

2903
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:17,310
Where is he?

2904
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:19,330
Okay, I'm trying to find the side entrance.

2905
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:23,690
Where am I?

2906
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:25,070
Oh, I see you!

2907
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:25,470
I see you!

2908
01:38:25,490 --> 01:38:25,890
I hear you!

2909
01:38:27,230 --> 01:38:27,550
Hello?

2910
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:28,710
Here, here.

2911
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:29,730
This way, this way, this way.

2912
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:31,590
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

2913
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:33,130
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2914
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:33,450
I'll come.

2915
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:33,830
I'll help.

2916
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:34,210
I'll help.

2917
01:38:34,610 --> 01:38:35,230
Take it back.

2918
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:35,810
Take it back.

2919
01:38:35,930 --> 01:38:36,450
Okay, okay, okay.

2920
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:36,790
Don't worry.

2921
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:37,090
I'll help you too.

2922
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:39,450
I'll help you too.

2923
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:40,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2924
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:41,730
I got my hands full.

2925
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:42,930
Can we come up here?

2926
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:43,870
No, we can't.

2927
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:44,310
Unfortunately.

2928
01:38:44,890 --> 01:38:45,870
How do we go back?

2929
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:46,230
Oh, here!

2930
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:48,350
Wait, how do we...?

2931
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:48,990
Where is the shoe?

2932
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:50,490
Wait, I don't think we can...

2933
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:51,170
We have to jump!

2934
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:51,530
Jump!

2935
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:51,850
Jump!

2936
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:53,610
Wait, can we...?

2937
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:55,650
Eh, eh?

2938
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:56,330
I think...

2939
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:57,170
Wait, wait, wait.

2940
01:38:57,650 --> 01:38:58,110
Oh, where?

2941
01:38:58,270 --> 01:38:58,690
How can we...

2942
01:38:58,690 --> 01:38:58,790
Yeah, we're stuck.

2943
01:38:58,830 --> 01:38:59,430
How can we get up?

2944
01:38:59,490 --> 01:39:00,390
Wait, I think we're stuck.

2945
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:01,070
How can we get up?

2946
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:01,770
I think we're stuck.

2947
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:03,130
I think we're...

2948
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:04,670
Wait!

2949
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:06,630
Wait!

2950
01:39:06,730 --> 01:39:07,690
I think I'm stuck!

2951
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:09,030
What?

2952
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:13,690
I think... I think we can come up from here.

2953
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:14,970
Maybe here.

2954
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:16,050
Can we?

2955
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:17,370
This way?

2956
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:23,110
Maybe it's too heavy?

2957
01:39:23,410 --> 01:39:23,910
No!

2958
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:25,550
No I can't!

2959
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:26,070
I can't!

2960
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,760
We're stuck!

2961
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,220
We're stuck!

2962
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:43,960
We can't get up!

2963
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:47,360
Okay, we can just bring the loot to the other exit.

2964
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,540
But where's the other exit?

2965
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:49,300
I don't remember!

2966
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:50,240
Maybe this way?

2967
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,100
I remember, just pick this...

2968
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:54,500
Okay, okay, I got the milk can.

2969
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:55,340
Okay, okay, okay.

2970
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:57,280
But who gets this?

2971
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:58,180
Where are we?

2972
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:58,980
We just follow him.

2973
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:00,800
Oh, I can get...

2974
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,240
Wait, where are you?

2975
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:05,280
Can you pick up this flask on the ground?

2976
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,540
My hands are full.

2977
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:07,020
No.

2978
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,820
We'll go back and get it later.

2979
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,160
I'm hands full.

2980
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:12,180
Do you have any empty slots?

2981
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:13,420
No, hands full.

2982
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:13,960
Oh, wait.

2983
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:14,840
I, I, wait.

2984
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:15,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2985
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:16,880
I'm, I'm, I'm...

2986
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:17,180
Here.

2987
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,080
Okay.

2988
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:18,600
Okay, stop.

2989
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,180
Okay.

2990
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:19,500
Okay.

2991
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,900
No, I won't keep talking.

2992
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,400
Oh wait, it's down here.

2993
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:25,340
Are you sure you remember?

2994
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:27,840
Yes, I was just there.

2995
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:28,800
Okay.

2996
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:31,820
Mom?

2997
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,120
Oh...

2998
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:39,170
Here.

2999
01:40:39,370 --> 01:40:40,410
I'm so scared.

3000
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:40,810
Okay.

3001
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:43,210
Oh, hey.

3002
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:43,910
There's another exit!

3003
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:45,470
Oh, there's another exit!

3004
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:46,010
Nice.

3005
01:40:46,010 --> 01:40:46,170
Nice.

3006
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,790
Oh, we're safe.

3007
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:48,930
Okay, okay, we have to go back.

3008
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:50,190
There's still like two items.

3009
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:53,810
There's still two more items we left in the exit.

3010
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:55,970
Wait, did we?

3011
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:57,890
Yeah, we didn't take everything.

3012
01:40:59,110 --> 01:41:00,390
Okay, we'll go pick it up.

3013
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:03,370
Yeah, yeah, there was like a big item we didn't pick up.

3014
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:07,230
Oh, can you get the walkie-talkie too?

3015
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:09,530
I think we took everything.

3016
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:11,650
No, no, no, we left the walkie-talkie.

3017
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:16,110
Fuck a walkie-talkie, I don't know.

3018
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:18,290
But that's like... that was $20.

3019
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:20,150
Oh, maybe the ship... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3020
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:22,210
Oh, I see it, I see the ship.

3021
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:25,270
Oh, we can... we can sell the walkie-talkie.

3022
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:28,370
Alright, nice.

3023
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:32,690
It was like... no, we actually left a big item though.

3024
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:34,750
Alright, no, we took it.

3025
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:37,510
No, there was a big item there, wasn't it?

3026
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:39,590
Yeah, but I took it in.

3027
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,610
Oh, I had empty slots.

3028
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:42,670
I didn't realize.

3029
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:45,230
She had an empty slot.

3030
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:46,090
I had three empty slots.

3031
01:41:46,770 --> 01:41:49,910
So we lost a walkie-talkie for no reason.

3032
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:52,610
Okay, and here's...

3033
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:55,050
So how much money do we make?

3034
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:57,350
Oh, we made $275.

3035
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:59,990
No, $306.

3036
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:01,610
We made it!

3037
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:03,130
There's things inside here.

3038
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:04,410
We did it!

3039
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:04,850
$354.

3040
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:07,510
We need $389.

3041
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:07,990
$354.

3042
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:09,970
We need $389 though.

3043
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:11,130
We have enough.

3044
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:12,490
How much more days do we have?

3045
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:14,150
This was our last day.

3046
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:14,870
Only one day.

3047
01:42:15,070 --> 01:42:15,970
Only one day.

3048
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:16,150
We gotta go in there then.

3049
01:42:16,150 --> 01:42:16,870
This is our last day.

3050
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:17,750
Yeah.

3051
01:42:17,790 --> 01:42:19,330
We gotta go in there and pick up one more thing.

3052
01:42:19,490 --> 01:42:21,390
Okay, we can sell our walkie-talkies.

3053
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:21,450
Okay.

3054
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:24,170
They're... no, they cost nothing.

3055
01:42:24,210 --> 01:42:25,490
I don't think we can sell it.

3056
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:26,210
Oh, okay.

3057
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:27,230
Do you want me to hold...

3058
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:27,910
Okay, I can help.

3059
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:28,590
I'll help.

3060
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:29,010
I'll help.

3061
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:30,990
Wait, but it's 8... 9 p.m.

3062
01:42:30,990 --> 01:42:31,150
now.

3063
01:42:32,370 --> 01:42:34,250
We can't take the honeycomb.

3064
01:42:34,530 --> 01:42:35,390
We can't take the bees.

3065
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:35,850
The bees.

3066
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:36,850
Oh, the bees!

3067
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:37,510
Yeah, the bees!

3068
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:39,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3069
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:40,230
How much is the bees?

3070
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:40,750
Okay, well, we...

3071
01:42:41,370 --> 01:42:43,170
It's like $70 or $80 or something.

3072
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:43,810
Oh, wait, the bees!

3073
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:45,150
Yeah, the bees and we make it.

3074
01:42:45,230 --> 01:42:46,050
Wait, giant, giant!

3075
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:50,990
Okay, you can take the bees, but do you know how to do it?

3076
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:51,430
No.

3077
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:54,330
Just pick it up and run to the ship.

3078
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:54,890
Oh, I did.

3079
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:55,390
I'll watch.

3080
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:58,650
The giant, the giant.

3081
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:00,410
Please come here, please come here.

3082
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:01,650
Take the bees, take the bees.

3083
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:02,210
Oh my god.

3084
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:03,910
No, no, the giant's...

3085
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:05,190
The giant's beside the bee.

3086
01:43:05,730 --> 01:43:06,430
No, he's not.

3087
01:43:08,450 --> 01:43:10,230
He's... he's there, he's there, he's there.

3088
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:11,170
Near the bees.

3089
01:43:13,190 --> 01:43:13,790
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3090
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:14,110
Watch, watch, watch.

3091
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:15,630
I'm running.

3092
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:18,750
Oh, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

3093
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:20,030
He's running, he's running, he's running.

3094
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:22,430
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!

3095
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:35,210
Did you guys take it?

3096
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:35,750
No!

3097
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:37,250
Ditto got scared!

3098
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,220
He can still grab you, he can still grab you here.

3099
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,760
We need to take it or we lose.

3100
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:47,620
Our bee...

3101
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:48,080
We...

3102
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:51,140
Ditto got scared and then the giant started chasing us.

3103
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:52,220
I think Ditto died.

3104
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,060
No, she's alive.

3105
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:54,860
Oh, she's alive?

3106
01:43:57,620 --> 01:43:58,020
Yeah.

3107
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:03,800
Maybe she grabbed the bees.

3108
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:07,500
She didn't.

3109
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,560
Did you get the bees, Ditto?

3110
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:09,500
Okay, I'll go get the bees.

3111
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,220
No, I don't get it, I don't get it.

3112
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:12,540
We believe in you, RPR!

3113
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:14,860
I can get it.

3114
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:19,000
There's... there's a giant beast alone near the bees.

3115
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:19,120
I can't see it.

3116
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:22,400
Where?

3117
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:24,500
I'm here... I'm here, Ditto.

3118
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:26,300
He's not, he's still alive, he's moving.

3119
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:29,300
Oh no, he's not... oh shit, oh yeah, he's moving.

3120
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:29,780
He's gonna grab the bees.

3121
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:30,380
He's gonna grab it.

3122
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,460
I'm gonna dance for victory.

3123
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:34,720
We believe in you.

3124
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,520
I believe in him too.

3125
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:35,720
Yeah.

3126
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,720
But he didn't grab the bees, he grabbed an item.

3127
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,160
I say.

3128
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:42,080
Oh, I say.

3129
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,140
Oh, I think...

3130
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:45,280
Fuck.

3131
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:46,760
The ship is leaving.

3132
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,880
I think the ship is leaving.

3133
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:52,180
I think the ship is leaving.

3134
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:53,940
The ship is leaving.

3135
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:56,280
I think he was too late.

3136
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,060
You guys are not real!

3137
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,680
It doesn't matter if you die to the giant, just pick up the loot or we lose anyway.

3138
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,560
There was an ant in there.

3139
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:21,680
The giant was chasing me.

3140
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:23,480
We fell off.

3141
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,700
The giant was chasing me.

3142
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,140
I don't care.

3143
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:30,380
They could have grabbed it when he was chasing.

3144
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,960
She could have grabbed it.

3145
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,860
One of you died, the other one take the bee.

3146
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:37,480
Yeah, to help.

3147
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:39,540
He was chasing me.

3148
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:41,820
He was chasing me.

3149
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:44,140
It wasn't my fault.

3150
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:46,180
That guy.

3151
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,140
Wait, we need ten dollars.

3152
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:51,180
One body is like ten dollars, right?

3153
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:52,800
No, it's...

3154
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,340
One body.

3155
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:55,440
How much is...

3156
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:57,160
That's me!

3157
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:58,420
It was Dino's fault!

3158
01:45:58,780 --> 01:45:59,980
It was Dino's fault!

3159
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,520
It was Dino's fault!

3160
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,500
I swear!

3161
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,940
It wasn't my fault!

3162
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,260
It was Dino's fault!

3163
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:11,920
It wasn't my fault, I swear!

3164
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:13,560
You need to die for the company.

3165
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:16,060
No, I didn't!

3166
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:16,860
I didn't die!

3167
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,500
You both need to die for the company.

3168
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,860
The more money, the better.

3169
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,240
Only one of us have...

3170
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:25,380
No!

3171
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:27,220
Only one of us is dead!

3172
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,900
There is behind you!

3173
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:30,800
There is behind...

3174
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:31,980
Huh?

3175
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,280
What is this?

3176
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,080
What do you mean?

3177
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:46,940
Why did I get pound nine?

3178
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:48,100
You think you're safe?

3179
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:48,840
You think you're safe?

3180
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:49,560
You think you're safe?

3181
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:58,680
No!

3182
01:46:58,680 --> 01:46:59,640
No, don't jump off!

3183
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:02,560
You're gonna make a fool of yourself.

3184
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:03,340
You're gonna make a fool of yourself.

3185
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:04,860
Why are you running?

3186
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:06,780
I'm not running!

3187
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:07,600
I'm not running!

3188
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,580
Why did you kill us?

3189
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:10,880
Why are you trying to kill us?

3190
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,080
Because your body is worth money!

3191
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,180
How about your body?

3192
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,240
How about your body?

3193
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:19,040
Yeah, well, I got the shovel, don't I?

3194
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:20,760
Yeah, you're gonna die.

3195
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,400
Okay, then we're gonna lose.

3196
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:22,900
Fuck it.

3197
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:23,340
Let's lose.

3198
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:24,240
I'm leaving.

3199
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:24,540
No!

3200
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:25,360
No!

3201
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:25,780
No!

3202
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,780
I sacrificed my body!

3203
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:31,440
I will sell your body.

3204
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,600
It's okay, we will win the game.

3205
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:49,360
We are going to win the game with our bodies.

3206
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,380
Are we going to make it?

3207
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:54,760
Yes, because it's 10 dollars.

3208
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:56,260
We just needed 10 dollars.

3209
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:01,720
We just needed that 10 dollars.

3210
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:02,820
Oh, we do.

3211
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:03,880
Blast.

3212
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,480
There's more.

3213
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:08,540
If he knows...

3214
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:11,660
Do I sell the walkie-talkie chat?

3215
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:13,880
Can I even sell the walkie-talkie?

3216
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,100
Why is he so mad?

3217
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,620
Yeah, why is he so mad?

3218
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,360
He's so mad today.

3219
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:27,580
I don't understand.

3220
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:31,280
Maybe we make him wake up too early.

3221
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:35,560
Yeah, maybe it's because it's too early.

3222
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:43,800
How much money do we get?

3223
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,580
How much do we get?

3224
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:51,320
We should have enough, right?

3225
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,920
We're short 25.

3226
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:56,360
25?

3227
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,220
What can we sell at 25?

3228
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,620
Then what's the point of killing us?

3229
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:01,820
45?

3230
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,000
25.

3231
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:04,980
Sell the toy.

3232
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:05,700
25.

3233
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,460
If only he could have sold it.

3234
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,840
Sold by one engine or one beehive.

3235
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:16,280
The nine of them took but had two fucking whole minutes to take.

3236
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,000
But instead they were running.

3237
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:22,000
Because living is more important than making money for the company.

3238
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,280
Now we die.

3239
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,080
All of us.

3240
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:26,960
We die as a team.

3241
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,840
We die as a team.

3242
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:32,040
Yeah.

3243
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:36,960
We die as a team.

3244
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,820
Yeah, we die.

3245
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:41,180
If Uto was here...

3246
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:43,440
If Uto was here...

3247
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,320
If Uto was here...

3248
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:48,240
If Uto was here, we would have made the money.

3249
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:51,140
We would have made the money if Uto was here.

3250
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:51,760
Listen to me.

3251
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:56,440
If one of you picked up the beehive or the engine...

3252
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:59,560
or the other person is being chased by the giant...

3253
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:00,580
Yeah, dude.

3254
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,960
I was being chased by a giant.

3255
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,440
I was being chased by a giant.

3256
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:05,960
Just die for the...

3257
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,480
Die for the car, you guys.

3258
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:17,910
It's unbelievable.

3259
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:18,070
It's unbelievable.

3260
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:23,470
Try your best.

3261
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:24,530
Will you always like this?

3262
01:50:25,170 --> 01:50:25,710
Yeah.

3263
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:29,210
If I always like this, you are so against it today.

3264
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,630
We will try our best.

3265
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:32,610
Holy shit.

3266
01:50:32,810 --> 01:50:33,690
Holy shit.

3267
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:35,390
After all of that.

3268
01:50:35,690 --> 01:50:37,270
That's what you say to me, Dito.

3269
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:38,690
Guys, listen.

3270
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:41,410
I will have a meeting in ten minutes.

3271
01:50:43,110 --> 01:50:44,150
You have a meeting?

3272
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:47,270
Yes, I have a meeting in ten minutes.

3273
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:48,910
I'm calling it here.

3274
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:49,890
It's a GG.

3275
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:50,750
So we're done here.

3276
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:52,270
It's a GG.

3277
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:54,270
Are we finally done?

3278
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:59,830
We did it.

3279
01:50:59,910 --> 01:51:01,530
Are we finally done with this culture?

3280
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:01,950
Yay.

3281
01:51:02,130 --> 01:51:04,070
Next time, next time...

3282
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:04,990
Next time...

3283
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:05,950
Hey, we're totally okay.

3284
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:08,290
Next time, Uto will be here, guys.

3285
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:09,910
Oh my god.

3286
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:11,810
Yay.

3287
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:13,510
I'm free.

3288
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:14,850
Yay.

3289
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:15,330
From this pill.

3290
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:18,710
Yay.

3291
01:51:18,710 --> 01:51:19,350
Oh my god.

3292
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:20,850
I thought it was never going to end.

3293
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:22,710
I thought it was going to separate here from...

3294
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:24,710
I had a great time, guys.

3295
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:26,150
It was a great...

3296
01:51:26,150 --> 01:51:27,930
I had a great time playing with all of you.

3297
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:28,410
Yeah, great time.

3298
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:29,810
This was so fun.

3299
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:30,190
Yeah, thank you.

3300
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:31,050
We were so...

3301
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:32,150
We had a lot of fun.

3302
01:51:32,210 --> 01:51:32,530
Yeah.

3303
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:33,170
We had a lot of fun.

3304
01:51:33,170 --> 01:51:34,090
I learned so much.

3305
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:36,890
I learned so much working in this company.

3306
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:38,690
Yeah, yeah.

3307
01:51:38,690 --> 01:51:39,530
Yeah, you guys definitely...

3308
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:40,990
You did so much work.

3309
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:41,510
Yeah.

3310
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:43,490
Yeah, you guys did so much work.

3311
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:45,430
I'm really happy to working with you up here.

3312
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:45,890
It's so nice.

3313
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:47,250
Yeah, I'm really happy to work with you up here.

3314
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:48,670
I'm really happy to work with you guys up here.

3315
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:48,710
Oh, I'm so happy to work with you.

3316
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:49,210
You are great leader.

3317
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:50,470
It's such a nice opportunity.

3318
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:52,410
I was so happy...

3319
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:59,950
Like if I could compare like working with you guys to anything, it's almost like playing Wii 9 in League of Legends.

3320
01:52:01,790 --> 01:52:03,550
You are a great leader.

3321
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:04,350
Yeah.

3322
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:05,390
Great boss.

3323
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:06,330
Good boss.

3324
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:09,870
I can't handle you guys.

3325
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:15,530
Even though you were the laziest employee, we think you were the best se- I'm the laziest!

3326
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:16,290
Yeah.

3327
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:20,490
Did you see how much money I made us every run?

3328
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:25,050
You bought a toilet with my hard earned money!

3329
01:52:25,250 --> 01:52:26,670
You bought a toilet!

3330
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:29,110
I was just reading the game stats!

3331
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:31,450
You bought a toilet with my money!

3332
01:52:31,650 --> 01:52:33,150
I was explaining what we thought.

3333
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:35,370
Yeah, I just read what the game said.

3334
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:37,570
You bought a fucking toilet!

3335
01:52:39,530 --> 01:52:41,930
You could have bought anything else!

3336
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:43,670
A poop box and a toilet!

3337
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:46,870
It was a good poop box, I had a good time.

3338
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:49,510
You could have bought a stun gun, a shovel, anything!

3339
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:52,450
I bought walkie talkies!

3340
01:52:53,110 --> 01:53:01,930
As I'm making money for you to survive, you guys are planning to kill me in front of the main entrance with stop signs?

3341
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:03,590
How are you real?

3342
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:05,410
Why are you so mad?

3343
01:53:05,850 --> 01:53:07,270
We were just talking!

3344
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:09,350
It was like girl talk, right?

3345
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:10,550
It was girl talk.

3346
01:53:10,870 --> 01:53:13,650
I was making so much money and then I died to a brat!

3347
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:15,730
I went to the dorm and I got an injection that slaps my neck in half!

3348
01:53:15,910 --> 01:53:18,550
And then I expected you guys to see what you guys are doing!

3349
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:21,770
Maybe you guys are making money, but no!

3350
01:53:22,410 --> 01:53:25,670
You guys are standing at the door and saying how you got enough of me!

3351
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:27,030
We also make money!

3352
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:29,070
Yeah, we brought money back!

3353
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:33,330
You are making money for me, you are trying to murder me, you are planning to kill me!

3354
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:38,350
If you didn't die, we could have made more money!

3355
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:41,150
If I didn't die you would have killed me!

3356
01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:42,410
No, we wouldn't.

3357
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:43,530
We were doing girl talk.

3358
01:53:43,630 --> 01:53:44,470
We wouldn't.

3359
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:45,690
We were just talking.

3360
01:53:46,290 --> 01:53:47,550
You wouldn't understand.

3361
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:49,910
You don't understand girl talk.

3362
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:55,070
Sometimes we just say we were joking.

3363
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:56,870
Yeah, we were like JK.

3364
01:53:58,290 --> 01:54:03,430
If you were respecting us earlier, you could tell they don't know.

3365
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:06,150
We were like, okay, let's pretend we're gonna kill him.

3366
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:07,990
It'll be so funny if we pretend, right?

3367
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:08,530
Yeah.

3368
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:10,250
We're gonna scare him.

3369
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:17,590
You guys really... after years of knowing you guys, you guys think I believe anything that comes out of your mouth?

3370
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:19,730
I don't.

3371
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:20,390
Ever.

3372
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:25,410
It's dumb and dumber, I hear from them.

3373
01:54:25,470 --> 01:54:26,230
Dumb and dumber.

3374
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:30,610
If Uto was here too, he wouldn't yell at us.

3375
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:34,070
If Uto was here, he wouldn't yell at us.

3376
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:38,510
Yeah, cause Uto's an actual angel that would try to get us out of this mess.

3377
01:54:38,530 --> 01:54:39,750
This godforsaken planet.

3378
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:42,930
While you two are sabotaging my hard fucking work.

3379
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:48,670
If only Uto was here.

3380
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:53,550
This is insane.

3381
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:55,910
I feel 20 years older after this.

3382
01:54:59,030 --> 01:55:00,650
It's not even funny.

3383
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:06,470
I had a great time, guys.

3384
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:08,650
Someone clicked this whole thing, bro.

3385
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:10,590
The descent into madness.

3386
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:18,450
I start off as a normal working employee, and as we keep going, I become a fucking villain, bro.

3387
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:21,390
You turn me into the fucking Joker in like an hour.

3388
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:29,290
You don't have to be this mad, just come down, come down, come down.

3389
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:29,290
Kill him.

3390
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:30,850
You can get HR in here.

3391
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:33,670
It's not good for your health, you know?

3392
01:55:33,710 --> 01:55:34,870
Yeah, it's not good.

3393
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:35,530
You're aging.

3394
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:36,110
You're too mad.

3395
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:36,770
You're getting older.

3396
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:37,730
You need to calm down.

3397
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:39,390
The stress isn't good for you.

3398
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:42,030
Your blood pressure is rising.

3399
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:43,610
You gotta calm down.

3400
01:55:43,870 --> 01:55:45,090
I'm only 27!

3401
01:55:48,050 --> 01:55:49,630
It's not good for you.

3402
01:55:49,690 --> 01:55:52,170
See, I told you the stress isn't good for you right now.

3403
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:54,330
The stress isn't good for you.

3404
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:59,430
You will get older faster.

3405
01:55:59,770 --> 01:56:01,470
Yeah, you'll get older faster.

3406
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:05,510
You could put a perfectly healthy man into a mental institution.

3407
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:06,310
In two hours.

3408
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:14,230
GG, Scott.

3409
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:14,690
I'm out of luck.

3410
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:15,070
Yay!

3411
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:16,750
Hey, shut...

3412
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:17,890
I'm taking the bag off!

3413
01:56:20,110 --> 01:56:20,770
I'm done.

3414
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:27,590
He's done.

3415
01:56:28,270 --> 01:56:29,370
Oh my God.

3416
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:32,290
I had a great time, guys.

3417
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:34,350
Next time, I will...

3418
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:37,730
I will definitely check with Jody next time.

3419
01:56:39,130 --> 01:56:40,410
Next time.

3420
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:51,710
Next time, if Uto joins and she's as bad as you guys, I will jump off the f-cking ship as we start playing every single time.

3421
01:56:53,330 --> 01:56:54,130
I swear to God.

3422
01:56:54,130 --> 01:56:55,310
Why would you do that?

3423
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:58,110
Uto better not be...

3424
01:56:58,110 --> 01:56:58,350
No.

3425
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:00,490
...corrupt by you two f-cking demons.

3426
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:02,070
No, we won't.

3427
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:02,830
We're not demons.

3428
01:57:03,230 --> 01:57:03,970
We're angels.

3429
01:57:04,090 --> 01:57:04,810
She's cheating.

3430
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:06,370
She's good like us.

3431
01:57:06,490 --> 01:57:08,270
Yeah, she's good just like you!

3432
01:57:09,130 --> 01:57:10,110
Like us.

3433
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:11,970
You're not good!

3434
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:12,950
We're good people!

3435
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:13,370
You're evil!

3436
01:57:13,630 --> 01:57:15,410
We're good people, we made us money!

3437
01:57:15,610 --> 01:57:17,470
You're two demons born of hell!

3438
01:57:17,790 --> 01:57:18,770
Both of you!

3439
01:57:23,290 --> 01:57:24,410
We'll be fine!

3440
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:25,650
We'll be okay!

3441
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:28,450
We'll be okay, guys!

3442
01:57:31,330 --> 01:57:31,950
I had...

3443
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:32,570
Save me!

3444
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:35,710
You know, guys, I had a great time.

3445
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:37,610
Yeah, me too.

3446
01:57:37,710 --> 01:57:39,150
It was great!

3447
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:40,630
It was amazing time.

3448
01:57:40,810 --> 01:57:41,950
It was great playing with you two.

3449
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:43,010
So much fun!

3450
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:44,350
It was so fun, guys!

3451
01:57:44,490 --> 01:57:45,570
So fucking fun!

3452
01:57:45,910 --> 01:57:47,130
It was so fun!

3453
01:57:47,490 --> 01:57:48,050
Yeah, see?

3454
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:49,470
You thought it was fun!

3455
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:50,690
See?

3456
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:51,810
So fun!

3457
01:57:52,090 --> 01:57:52,910
Yeah, great fun!

3458
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:59,210
Here, do you need a hug?

3459
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:00,390
Do you need a hug?

3460
01:58:02,810 --> 01:58:05,070
I'm going to Altifor in five seconds.

3461
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:08,270
Say your last words right now.

3462
01:58:08,670 --> 01:58:09,470
You were...

3463
01:58:09,470 --> 01:58:11,250
You were a great leader, Artie.

3464
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:12,470
You were the greatest employee.

3465
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:17,330
I didn't say that!

3466
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:18,450
She said that!

3467
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:18,990
What did she say?

3468
01:58:19,070 --> 01:58:19,870
What did she say?

3469
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:22,250
I didn't say anything!

3470
01:58:22,730 --> 01:58:23,730
What did she say?

3471
01:58:23,790 --> 01:58:24,610
What did she say?

3472
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:25,350
What did she say?

3473
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:27,490
You are the greatest employee.

3474
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:30,510
Employee?

3475
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:31,330
I'm an employee?

3476
01:58:31,330 --> 01:58:32,010
Yeah.

3477
01:58:32,150 --> 01:58:34,050
Yeah, you are paid to dance for sure.

3478
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:35,930
You are a fucking part-timer!

3479
01:58:36,130 --> 01:58:37,470
You are a great partner.

3480
01:58:38,350 --> 01:58:39,850
I said you were great.

3481
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:40,670
You are our great partner.

3482
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:41,610
Yeah.

3483
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:48,150
Can we self-destruct this fucking shit?

3484
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:50,770
GG's, guys!

3485
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:52,390
GG's!

3486
01:58:52,670 --> 01:58:54,810
I had a good time.

3487
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:56,770
I'll see you guys next time.

3488
01:58:56,850 --> 01:58:58,730
With Uto this time.

3489
01:58:58,850 --> 01:59:00,250
Yeah, it was a good game, guys.

3490
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,030
Good game!

3491
01:59:01,330 --> 01:59:02,830
I can't wait for another one of these.

3492
01:59:03,030 --> 01:59:03,490
Yay!

3493
01:59:04,590 --> 01:59:05,250
Yay!

3494
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:06,510
Yay!

3495
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:11,050
Bye-bye, guys.

3496
01:59:12,450 --> 01:59:13,110
Goodbye.

3497
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:14,030
Bye!

3498
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:22,190
Guys, I think I...

3499
01:59:22,190 --> 01:59:25,210
I had a great time, everybody.

3500
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:29,590
Guys, you heard RPO.

3501
01:59:29,690 --> 01:59:31,150
You had a great time.

3502
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:41,550
I am saying the entire stream since 3 am, and I don't regret one bit.

3503
01:59:41,730 --> 01:59:42,230
Thank you.

3504
01:59:42,290 --> 01:59:42,870
Thank you for the super chat.

3505
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:43,310
Thank you.

3506
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:43,750
Thank you.

3507
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:46,770
I think we had good teamwork.

3508
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:49,270
We worked really well together.

3509
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:50,350
Chat.

3510
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:52,150
What do you mean?

3511
01:59:55,210 --> 02:00:00,490
Guys, I think we had a good time together.

3512
02:00:00,510 --> 02:00:01,130
I think we had a great time.

3513
02:00:04,850 --> 02:00:13,230
I still can't believe... I still can't believe... Ditto organized this collab and she forgot to tell Uto the time.

3514
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:15,510
I thought that was the funniest shit.

3515
02:00:15,690 --> 02:00:21,590
Because she told me and RPR but then she forgot to tell Uto.

3516
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:28,470
Oh my god.

3517
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:32,610
Holy shit.

3518
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:34,450
I had a great time.

3519
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:35,430
This was great.

3520
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:39,890
It was good teamwork.

3521
02:00:40,110 --> 02:00:44,970
I think we... I think we had really good teamwork.

3522
02:00:47,150 --> 02:00:48,650
Rose, thank you for the super chat.

3523
02:00:48,710 --> 02:00:48,990
Thank you.

3524
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:49,530
Thank you.

3525
02:00:49,530 --> 02:00:51,570
I got to tell him but it was hilarious.

3526
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:52,310
Thank you for the super chat.

3527
02:00:52,470 --> 02:00:52,650
Thank you.

3528
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:52,970
Thank you.

3529
02:00:53,050 --> 02:00:56,970
Without us, RPR wouldn't be able to move the money.

3530
02:00:57,610 --> 02:01:00,450
Ditto and I got all the money to the ship.

3531
02:01:00,610 --> 02:01:01,030
Wait.

3532
02:01:01,130 --> 02:01:02,050
What are you guys talking about?

3533
02:01:02,450 --> 02:01:05,690
We moved all the money to the ship.

3534
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:07,310
Oh my god.

3535
02:01:07,410 --> 02:01:07,590
Okay.

3536
02:01:07,870 --> 02:01:11,010
Next week... By the way, next week is going to be a little bit...

3537
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:13,190
I don't... Actually, I'm trying to remember what we have next week.

3538
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:14,490
Alright.

3539
02:01:14,490 --> 02:01:15,350
Challenger Circuit.

3540
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:19,650
ALGS Challenger Circuit is like semi-confirmed.

3541
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:22,730
I will be participating in the Challenger Circuit.

3542
02:01:23,490 --> 02:01:25,990
I think it's like Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

3543
02:01:26,450 --> 02:01:27,970
If you make it to the finals.

3544
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:29,730
So mostly it may be just Saturday.

3545
02:01:33,170 --> 02:01:37,790
So I will be doing that with Nice Wig and Tempo.

3546
02:01:39,390 --> 02:01:43,170
So we're just waiting on Wig to like sign us up.

3547
02:01:43,290 --> 02:01:45,550
But he's like... He's going to be signing us up.

3548
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:48,630
And he said it's going to be on the 22nd, I think.

3549
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:51,450
22nd... Or was it 23rd?

3550
02:01:52,350 --> 02:01:53,410
I don't remember.

3551
02:01:53,830 --> 02:01:54,310
It's like...

3552
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:57,630
I don't... Let me... Wait.

3553
02:01:57,810 --> 02:01:59,450
I actually don't remember.

3554
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:03,290
Whichever date Challenger Circuit starts next week.

3555
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:04,190
But...

3556
02:02:05,310 --> 02:02:11,430
We're going to be doing ALGS Challenger Circuit with Nice Wig and Tempo next week.

3557
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:14,450
I don't remember if it was like Saturday, Sunday, or Monday.

3558
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:15,090
Oh!

3559
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:16,950
And also...

3560
02:02:18,210 --> 02:02:20,990
I'm trying to remember any other updates I have to give you guys.

3561
02:02:22,030 --> 02:02:24,350
But I think that's really...

3562
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:25,650
I got like so many...

3563
02:02:25,650 --> 02:02:28,050
I got like invites to some like...

3564
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:28,450
Another...

3565
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:29,870
Like a turn...

3566
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:30,930
Lots of tournaments recently.

3567
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,070
So like...

3568
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:34,250
To the point where I actually have to like...

3569
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:37,490
Pick and choose what to participate.

3570
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:40,770
Because there's like a lot of tournament invites.

3571
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:42,430
And I actually had to...

3572
02:02:42,430 --> 02:02:45,690
For the first time, I actually had to decline a tournament.

3573
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:48,930
It was a tournament because I just had too much going on.

3574
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:51,710
So it's crazy!

3575
02:02:52,050 --> 02:02:53,950
I actually had to decline a tournament off.

3576
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:54,930
Like a tournament invite.

3577
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:56,530
It's supposed to be like a...

3578
02:02:56,530 --> 02:02:58,010
Another PAL World tournament.

3579
02:02:58,450 --> 02:02:59,350
But it's just like...

3580
02:02:59,350 --> 02:02:59,770
I'm gonna...

3581
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:02,930
I have like Apex stuff going on next week.

3582
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:03,790
I can't do both.

3583
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:05,570
I can't do both.

3584
02:03:10,090 --> 02:03:10,810
But yeah!

3585
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:15,030
Other than that, I think that is really...

3586
02:03:15,970 --> 02:03:19,950
That is really the only updates I have for you guys.

3587
02:03:20,110 --> 02:03:21,030
I am so...

3588
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:21,830
I'm so tired.

3589
02:03:22,030 --> 02:03:24,510
I took like a little nap before the stream.

3590
02:03:24,630 --> 02:03:25,710
Because I was like...

3591
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:26,170
Oh my god.

3592
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:27,210
Oh my god.

3593
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:27,450
Okay.

3594
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:29,230
El Reno originally...

3595
02:03:29,230 --> 02:03:31,590
We were supposed to do 5pm PST.

3596
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:32,590
But then...

3597
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:34,870
Because like for RPR, he's still in...

3598
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:36,170
He's still in EU.

3599
02:03:36,850 --> 02:03:37,370
So...

3600
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:40,670
We had to change the time.

3601
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:44,230
So at first, like we suggested 8am PST.

3602
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:46,690
And I was like...

3603
02:03:46,690 --> 02:03:46,910
No!

3604
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:49,450
Because I was like...

3605
02:03:49,450 --> 02:03:50,990
I can stay up.

3606
02:03:51,130 --> 02:03:53,190
But I cannot wake up Saturday.

3607
02:03:53,710 --> 02:03:54,570
So I was like...

3608
02:03:54,570 --> 02:03:54,950
Yeah, no.

3609
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:55,730
Not 8am.

3610
02:03:55,730 --> 02:03:56,170
8am.

3611
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:57,650
I cannot do 8am.

3612
02:03:58,090 --> 02:04:02,310
So we settled on like 1am because I was like...

3613
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:02,910
I can't.

3614
02:04:02,910 --> 02:04:03,230
Guys.

3615
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:05,510
1am is too much.

3616
02:04:05,590 --> 02:04:05,910
Guys.

3617
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:06,630
Like...

3618
02:04:06,630 --> 02:04:07,270
I'm not wondering.

3619
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:08,990
8am is too much.

3620
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:10,110
I cannot do mornings.

3621
02:04:10,270 --> 02:04:11,430
I can only...

3622
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:12,910
I can only stay up.

3623
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:16,570
I can only stay up until like 3am...

3624
02:04:16,570 --> 02:04:17,590
Like 3am to 4am.

3625
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:20,210
I cannot wake up at 8am.

3626
02:04:22,650 --> 02:04:24,870
So we settled on 1am.

3627
02:04:24,870 --> 02:04:25,450
1am.

3628
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:29,410
Anyway guys, I'm gonna call it here everybody.

3629
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:31,870
Oh my god, I didn't even realize my music was off.

3630
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:32,970
My BGM was off.

3631
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:33,990
But I'm gonna call it here.

3632
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:35,630
I hope you guys had a great time.

3633
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:38,230
For everybody in NA that stayed up.

3634
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:41,710
Now you know how the dragoons on the other side of the world feels like.

3635
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:42,870
It's your turn.

3636
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:44,730
It was your turn to stay up.

3637
02:04:47,930 --> 02:04:50,890
It's your turn now, dragoons and NA.

3638
02:04:51,170 --> 02:04:54,670
To stay up for D-Gen hours.

3639
02:04:55,270 --> 02:05:00,870
Anyway everybody, as always everyone, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3640
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:02,990
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3641
02:05:03,110 --> 02:05:04,350
Cause you deserve it.

3642
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:05,530
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3643
02:05:05,850 --> 02:05:06,410
Bye guys.

3644
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:07,270
Bye!
