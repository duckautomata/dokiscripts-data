1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
So, Marvel Rivals just came out.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,220
The newest, hit craze, third-person shooter game.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,740
And, because it just came out, Top 500 at the time was just plat.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,160
So, there was no eternity player yet.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,660
There was no one above all.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,280
Everybody had to start from zero.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,980
So, I decided to challenge myself and see how fast I could get to Top 500.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
Surprisingly, it didn't take that long.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,540
It took me three days of just playing Link to get to Top 500.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,100
In the world, by the way.

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,440
This is a global leaderboard.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,780
By the way, I was the very first VTuber to hit it, too.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,040
How did I do it?

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,600
Well, it's time for you to keep watching to find out.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,220
Hello!

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,600
We're back with Marvel Rivals because I am this close to Top 500.

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,240
I mean, I'm platinum three.

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,520
With, like, 6.6 hours of gameplay.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,880
And you're like, plat, that's not good.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:07,080
Well, plat one is the cutoff for Top 500, might I add.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,500
And, not only that, this is a global leaderboard.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,200
So, it's not just NA.

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,920
So, I am this close to get Top 500.

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,740
I'm really proud of myself to be able to get this close to Top 500.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
With my incredibly fucking busy hours.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,420
But, yeah, I've been, like, super addicted to Marvel Rivals.

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,020
Only because, like, whenever a new shiny competitive game comes out, I speedrun to the leaderboards.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,760
And then after getting it, I stop.

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,520
So, like, I might try and end Top 500 in Marvel Rivals.

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,760
Because after I get it, I just don't care about it anymore.

31
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,480
Because that's how it usually goes.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,360
Like...

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,200
Alright, I'm ready to focus up.

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,320
I gotta make sure our Hela is having a good time.

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,120
Okay, nice.

36
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,120
Okay.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,460
That's fine.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,100
I'll just save people.

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,120
Come on, guys!

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,680
Let's go!

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,860
Have fun!

42
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,260
Do your DPS!

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,140
Let's go!

44
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,280
Let's go!

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,320
Okay, I need to heal you, though.

46
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,540
Let's go!

47
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,160
Do your thing!

48
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:10,980
Let's go!

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,620
Oh, shit.

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,700
Let's go!

51
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,540
Survive!

52
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm healing!

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,420
I'm a support!

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,700
Let's go, guys!

55
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,620
I'm a one-trick!

56
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,440
Like, everything I learned from Luna Snow is just me learning it myself.

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,560
I don't actually know how to play her that optimally.

58
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,580
So, like, I won't watch, like, an actual pro player.

59
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,840
Like, I basically self-taught myself Luna Snow since Alpha.

60
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,180
So, like, I don't know how to actually play her optimally.

61
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,960
Stop.

62
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,760
Stop.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,780
Stop feeding.

64
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,580
Stop.

65
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,360
Stop.

66
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,300
The fuck are you doing?

67
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,700
Stop.

68
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,000
Please!

69
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,220
Please!

70
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,400
All you have to do is stop!

71
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,080
Oh, they got him!

72
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,920
They got him!

73
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,080
They got him!

74
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,960
We did it!

75
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,820
They got him!

76
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,120
Yeah!

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,640
That's right.

78
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
Fuck you, Margo!

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh my god.

80
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,700
Okay, we'll do Jeff.

81
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,460
I'm Kat.

82
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,060
I'm weak.

83
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm so weak.

84
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,640
It's okay.

85
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,080
If we lose, it's her fault.

86
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,920
Not my fault.

87
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,820
Because she wouldn't let me play my one-trick.

88
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,580
Jesus.

89
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,540
Yes!

90
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,380
Do something!

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm reloading my mouse!

92
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,160
I'm going in.

93
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,360
Oh, they're scared.

94
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,160
They're so scared.

95
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,030
I got their support too.

96
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,080
Easy.

97
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,440
Alright, I'm gonna avoid Margo because she's a one-trick too.

98
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,240
I can't help.

99
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,860
That became the one thing I hated the most.

100
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,540
Goddamn.

101
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,640
One-trick was the silver.

102
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,060
No!

103
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,680
Oh no.

104
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,280
It's time for Jeff, I guess.

105
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh my god.

106
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,840
Do we have like three Luna players?

107
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,040
This is bad.

108
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,340
We have too many Luna players.

109
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,800
Why do we have so many support players?

110
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,280
No!

111
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,030
There we go.

112
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,890
I was hoping to kill him.

113
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,550
Okay.

114
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,770
Sorry, I have to kill.

115
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,710
Sorry, I have to work on killing the Hawkeye.

116
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,250
I'm sorry, I couldn't help you, bro.

117
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,230
I'm gonna swap.

118
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,830
Alright, let's try it.

119
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,090
Let's learn her live.

120
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,010
We're gonna learn her live.

121
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,270
I don't know how to play her, but we're gonna...

122
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,050
Oh, but at least we get to look at something nice, I guess.

123
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,650
I don't know what I'm doing.

124
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,130
Oh my god.

125
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,550
How?

126
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,310
Oh my god.

127
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,190
Okay, we gotta go in, though.

128
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,630
Oh, what the fuck?

129
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,250
Okay, nevermind.

130
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,190
Okay, I'm just...

131
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:06,390
Alright.

132
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,370
Come on, let's go in, guys.

133
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,930
Let's...

134
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,230
Okay, I...

135
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,310
Okay, I died so fast in my ult.

136
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,230
Wait, we had three ults?

137
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,390
What happened?

138
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,590
Gotta avoid all the Luna snow.

139
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,250
This is a detriment to me.

140
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,470
Yeah, everybody stop playing Luna.

141
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,510
She's actually trash.

142
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,810
But I make her look good, guys.

143
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,730
There we go.

144
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,090
Oh!

145
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,670
What?

146
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,410
Oh my god!

147
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:36,930
What?

148
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,690
I was so dumb!

149
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,310
That was actually bullshit!

150
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:49,870
Alright.

151
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,150
Of course, it's me and Sharma.

152
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,790
We were both not paying attention because I was so dumb.

153
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,110
Because we were fucking streaming.

154
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,310
I had to penny the door.

155
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,510
I was like, I don't give a fuck.

156
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,890
I'm not sure for it.

157
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,300
I was like, what the fuck was that sound?

158
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,000
Holy fuck!

159
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I just...

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,200
Oh my god!

161
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,380
What did I do?

162
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,600
Shit, there's Hawkeye.

163
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,260
There's...

164
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,340
There's Hawkeye's ult.

165
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,800
Oh no!

166
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,700
That's all of us!

167
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,510
I heard it!

168
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,090
I heard the...

169
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,170
I

170
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:54,700
don't...

171
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,680
Goodbye.

172
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,100
Oh my god.

173
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,100
I don't need to use it yet.

174
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,800
There's no reason to.

175
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,340
No!

176
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,260
No!

177
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:09,920
No!

178
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,080
You can't eat me!

179
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,340
I had to!

180
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,180
I fucking had to!

181
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,220
That was the only way to live.

182
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,940
I ulted to live.

183
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,420
I actually ulted to live there.

184
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,260
I'm so hungry.

185
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,460
So hungry.

186
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,960
Alright, I think I froze somebody.

187
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,460
Yeah, I did.

188
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,880
Oh shit!

189
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,060
Ah, bitch.

190
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,940
That's fucking right.

191
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,240
Be afraid of me.

192
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,420
I am a Luna Snow that can fucking aim.

193
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,360
I need to do this for the stronger heals.

194
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,680
Oh my god!

195
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,860
Be afraid!

196
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,020
That's fucking right.

197
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,160
That's fucking right.

198
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,180
Oh, the cat.

199
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,520
That's so toxic!

200
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,760
Easy.

201
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:08,960
Yay!

202
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,560
One more rank, guys!

203
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,760
One more rank up!

204
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,780
Oh my god, I'm doing it!

205
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,420
Plat 2!

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,180
Yes, it's still Plat 1.

207
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,260
Oh my god, we're so close.

208
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,160
Oh my god, we're so close!

209
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,500
Bro, bro, I'm trying so hard!

210
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,300
Oh my god, you're alive!

211
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,220
Guys, did you see how they lined up for the clap?

212
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,400
Holy fuck!

213
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,020
That was like the perfect lineup.

214
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,180
Oh my god, it literally hit everybody.

215
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,020
Nice, we got...

216
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,980
Wow, you're alive!

217
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,720
How'd he...

218
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,350
My fucking gamer!

219
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,950
How the fuck...

220
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,730
He was not supposed to live.

221
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,450
We recreated the movie.

222
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,910
I think I'm gonna go for...

223
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,850
I'm gonna go for Plat 1 and then I'm gonna call it.

224
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,630
Because then I don't have to like speedrun anymore.

225
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,290
I'm only speedrunning because I want to touch the leaderboard.

226
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,690
And just to be like, hey guys.

227
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,470
Haha, look at this.

228
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,170
Um...

229
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:27,970
Um...

230
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,270
Liv...

231
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,810
Oh my...

232
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,390
How much damage are you taking?

233
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,130
Oh my god!

234
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,270
He's Groot.

235
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,790
No, no.

236
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,750
Oh, thank god.

237
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,710
I'm trying!

238
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:47,610
Guys!

239
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,260
Oh my god!

240
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,640
That's Jeff!

241
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,440
I was like, where did he come from?

242
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,280
I should eventually hit him, right?

243
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,120
There's like a clusterfuck of people there.

244
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm just shooting in the general direction, hoping I hit something.

245
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,380
Oh no, oh no!

246
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,060
I had to reload at that time!

247
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,840
We had three healers and all of you guys had to reload!

248
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,300
Warlock is good, but like, his heals are very limited.

249
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,260
I think Luna's better for sustainability.

250
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,260
I personally think after playing for this long, I think it's Luna, Mantis, and Cloak and Dagger.

251
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,920
I feel like are the best healers.

252
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,300
Nice.

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,600
Wait, me too.

254
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,100
I am also ready to put on a show.

255
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,320
Hey, me too!

256
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,060
Oh.

257
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,660
Oh my god.

258
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,320
Okay.

259
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,800
Okay.

260
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,100
Oh guys, calm the fuck down!

261
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,020
Guys.

262
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,780
There can't all be- We gotta calm down with all the shows, guys.

263
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,810
Jesus Christ, how did I live through all of that?

264
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,350
Holy shit, we're coming in with five ults.

265
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,550
Like, if we don't win this, this is like, we deserve to lose that round.

266
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,470
Like, we're literally coming in with like, six ults, five ults.

267
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,410
Alright, go in.

268
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,990
I like how he set up a turret there, he's like, this is it.

269
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,700
Okay, nice.

270
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,680
Nice.

271
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,180
We almost didn't stand on point.

272
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,120
That would have been so fucking bad.

273
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,840
Guys!

274
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
You know what that means!

275
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,160
Let's put on a show!

276
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,680
Yeah!

277
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,700
Better than 99.93 for people in the world!

278
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,780
Wait!

279
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,620
No, I'm so close!

280
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,540
I'm so close!

281
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,040
Oh my god, I'm so close.

282
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,100
It's like, right there.

283
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah!

284
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,620
Oh my god, three more wins.

285
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,260
We just need three more wins.

286
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,620
Oh my god, surely I'll win three in a row, right?

287
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,840
Surely, I'll win three in a row, right?

288
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,780
Surely, right?

289
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,700
Oh my god.

290
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,640
I'm stuck in this loop.

291
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,280
No!

292
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,420
There's

293
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,130
no fucking way.

294
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,250
There's no fucking way.

295
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,330
I am losing it.

296
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,370
I am 100% losing it right now.

297
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,870
Please.

298
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,010
Please.

299
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,630
Please.

300
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,230
Oh my god.

301
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,840
Like, what?

302
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,920
I went through hell.

303
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,260
I'm a better fucking player than all of you.

304
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,080
Like, I built my character.

305
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,980
Okay, like, I don't...

306
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,460
I can't fucking save you there.

307
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,540
Like, Jesus Christ.

308
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,600
Oh my god.

309
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,060
Oh my god.

310
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,520
I don't know what you want from me.

311
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,780
I don't...

312
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,120
I'm dead.

313
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880
I gotta save my fucking KD.

314
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,820
Did I heard that correctly?

315
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,840
We were losing so hard.

316
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,360
And then finally, when we had a chance to win, our Dr. Strange got stuck under the map and we were 5v6.

317
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,080
Curse of Ra worked.

318
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,180
Where's my heals?

319
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,300
Oh, what do you mean?

320
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,000
You had an orb.

321
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,920
Where's my heals at?

322
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,540
You had an entire orb.

323
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,760
Where's my heals at?

324
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,760
Alright, goodbye.

325
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,160
Oh my god.

326
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,900
I guess I die.

327
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,700
I'm dead.

328
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,580
Everything is fine.

329
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,840
The panther is low.

330
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,980
I'm not fine.

331
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,960
I'm not fine.

332
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,820
Oh my god.

333
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,740
Yeah, you so want to see me, bitch.

334
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,620
I have the power of god on my side.

335
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,180
Go, fucking fight.

336
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:29,740
Go.

337
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm scared.

338
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,180
I so wanted to save you.

339
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm out of this bitch.

340
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,300
You better kill somebody.

341
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm out of this bitch.

342
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,700
Oh my god.

343
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,380
The whole team is here.

344
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,280
I can't do shit.

345
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,360
We're here.

346
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,040
I can't believe you didn't kill anyone.

347
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,880
I can't believe.

348
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm putting on a show as well.

349
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,020
Watch me dance.

350
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,660
I'm beating the shit out of this mantis.

351
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,340
Do it.

352
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,660
Do it.

353
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,580
Where was my lunar ult at?

354
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,020
You were definitely not on it.

355
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,400
You were definitely not on the lunar ult.

356
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,280
That's for sure.

357
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,400
I might be dead though.

358
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,280
Oh my.

359
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,620
No.

360
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,160
Oh my god.

361
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,360
Jeff, where's Jeff?

362
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,420
Oh, I'm dead.

363
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:15,740
I'm dead.

364
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,100
I'm dead.

365
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,320
I knew I should have fucking trusted only myself.

366
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,560
What?

367
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,180
And he jumps off.

368
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,240
Of course, this fucker.

369
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,800
I have no support.

370
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,220
Don't fucking get me.

371
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,740
Let me not get this.

372
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,660
Stop.

373
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,720
Stop.

374
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,760
Because there's a...

375
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,880
Oh no, not that ult.

376
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,020
I can't.

377
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,500
I'm catching you.

378
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,400
We see nine.

379
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,600
Guys, I think I deranked to plat 3 from that.

380
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,980
I think I got deranked.

381
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,100
Alright, GG's though.

382
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,060
Those were fun games.

383
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,320
I hope you suffer.

384
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,020
What?

385
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,160
Why would you say that?

386
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,220
Because Curse of Ra and Loser's Key was funny.

387
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,880
That's... no, come on.

388
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,800
Alright, even though we didn't make it to top 500, we will try again tomorrow.

389
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,240
I really, really want to have... I'm desperate.

390
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,520
If we don't make it to top 500, I will replace all my streams with Marvel Rivals until we get top 500.

391
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,020
So you better hope that I fucking get top 500 today.

392
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,480
You think I fucking care?

393
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,640
I care about numbers.

394
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,260
I care about being a top 500 gamer right now.

395
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,540
We have Wanted and SK playing with me.

396
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,000
At least, like, I'll actually have DPS players this time.

397
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,340
Because for some fucking reason, every other player are getting too many DPS players.

398
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,500
But I have the opposite of that problem.

399
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,940
I have too many support players.

400
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,020
So, to fix that problem, now I have two DPS players.

401
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,260
I'd rather have too many DPS players.

402
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,900
Oh, okay.

403
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,340
Now that I said that.

404
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,590
You fucker.

405
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,490
We will damage boost.

406
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,050
We will out-damage all of this.

407
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,290
There's no way.

408
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,630
You actual fucker.

409
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,850
I will do a dance-off with you.

410
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,710
You think you're a better dancer than me?

411
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,610
I've been dancing for definitely more than 20 hours.

412
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,710
He's in my queue though.

413
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,730
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

414
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,310
No, I also hate all spiders too.

415
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,850
I hate a lot of things.

416
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,690
I used to never hate a lot of things.

417
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,590
But after playing Marvel Rivals, I'm the hater now.

418
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,370
I'm definitely afraid of bugs.

419
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,530
I would fucking go outside and squish a spider.

420
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,390
For every time a Peter Parker annoys me.

421
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,000
Alright, run.

422
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,180
Run, you're such a bitch.

423
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,710
Alright, I'm going outside and squishing a spider.

424
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,170
Ashley, fuck you.

425
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,890
Okay, you gotta admit.

426
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,070
No!

427
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,930
If you watch like yesterday's stream versus today's stream.

428
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,110
You can tell I'm a different person now.

429
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,990
It only takes one really, really fucking bad day.

430
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,950
Her smile, her optimism.

431
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,510
Gone forever.

432
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,710
Oh my god, you're so not fine.

433
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,210
Oh my...

434
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,290
Oh, I actually got greeted by the fucking staircase.

435
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,730
I think this is one of the worst maps.

436
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,010
Honestly.

437
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,070
This is one of the worst maps.

438
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,190
This is...

439
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,450
This is actually one of the worst.

440
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,650
I hate all these stupid staircases.

441
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,950
But like...

442
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,850
No, no, no, no, no, no.

443
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,230
Holy shit!

444
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,270
Holy shit!

445
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,990
That portal was fucking insane!

446
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,170
That

447
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,560
was actually an insane portal.

448
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,000
But he didn't kill me.

449
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,580
He forgot about me.

450
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,540
That's right.

451
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,560
Fuck it!

452
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,780
Should've killed the fucking support.

453
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,140
That's Ashe's...

454
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,400
Oh my god, people are getting too good at this game, guys.

455
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,020
I need to get top 500 before people learn everything.

456
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,080
Oh, she's one!

457
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,800
Okay, nice.

458
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,900
That was an insane ice shot, though.

459
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,640
Holy...

460
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,940
Please get me in a plat one.

461
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,440
Please.

462
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,620
We just need one more win and I'll be plat one.

463
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,800
And then we need four wins and I'll be fucking diamond three.

464
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,580
Oh, wait.

465
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,560
No, I was...

466
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:03,900
Ah, I'm blocked!

467
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,840
Yay!

468
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,620
Okay, we need three wins.

469
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,820
Three wins and then I'll be top 500.

470
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,240
Please pray for me.

471
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,820
First with the same movies.

472
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,860
I'm not plat two.

473
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm plat one.

474
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,040
I'm just peeking the stairs.

475
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,960
Oh my god!

476
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,090
Big viking tries to pound small woman.

477
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,710
There we go.

478
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,830
Don't worry, I saved your life.

479
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,130
No need to thank me.

480
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,280
There we go.

481
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,140
Oh, okay, that's fine.

482
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,080
We did it!

483
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,880
Yes!

484
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,280
We're 99.92% better than all of you.

485
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,900
We're out of the plat mine.

486
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,900
Two more games.

487
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,980
It's two more games.

488
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,440
Holy shit.

489
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,430
What the fuck?

490
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,290
How?

491
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,290
Jesus.

492
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,350
How much damage are y'all taking?

493
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,770
I don't know.

494
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,210
Yes.

495
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,060
Oh my god, he also...

496
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,660
I hate this because I keep going back to the portal.

497
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,580
So it's like...

498
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,220
What?

499
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,180
Why?

500
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,400
Going back in.

501
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,720
Can't go back in.

502
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,780
Can't peek back in.

503
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,640
I don't want to peek back in.

504
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,780
I don't want to be there anymore.

505
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,720
Three more games.

506
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,520
Three more...

507
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,730
Oh, he got shielded!

508
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,550
That would have hit if he didn't get shielded.

509
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,130
Guys, four more games.

510
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,690
This is not looking good.

511
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:06,590
Yes!

512
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,790
Oh, not yes.

513
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,690
Not yes anymore.

514
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,550
No, not yes.

515
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,690
Guys.

516
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:20,970
No.

517
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,490
No.

518
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,690
No, I just...

519
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,770
No.

520
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,490
Fuck, he caught!

521
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,040
Guys.

522
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,680
No.

523
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,700
No!

524
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,420
He bumped me off the health pack!

525
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,260
Oh my god.

526
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,840
This hurts.

527
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,140
Put on the nose, Draver.

528
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,420
Put it on.

529
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,480
Put on the nose.

530
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,140
Guys.

531
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,480
Guys.

532
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,820
Oh my god.

533
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,400
Oh fuck.

534
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,860
Oh fuck, that's so painful.

535
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh no.

536
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,780
Oh no!

537
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,340
What?!

538
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,080
Actual sponge.

539
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,640
Do it again.

540
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,340
No.

541
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,680
No, not again!

542
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,820
How do we get back?

543
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,560
This is...

544
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,140
I need some...

545
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,680
I believe.

546
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,380
Nobody's getting damaged though.

547
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,960
That's fucking right.

548
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,580
When does it end?

549
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,060
When does it end?

550
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,510
No!

551
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,970
Oh crap.

552
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:48,890
No.

553
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,480
He has way too many notes.

554
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,480
No, it's over.

555
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,460
Yes, yes, we did it!

556
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,040
Oh my god, that's the last fight.

557
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,800
Oh my god.

558
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,440
Oh my god.

559
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,320
Block it, block it, we did it!

560
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,180
Oh my god, we're actually free.

561
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,320
Don't think it's over.

562
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,160
For today.

563
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,980
And then my game crashed.

564
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,200
Do I get the points?

565
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,800
My game crashed just then.

566
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,020
Surely you get the points.

567
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,060
Surely you get the points.

568
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,660
Do you want me to tell you if you got the points?

569
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,200
I didn't, did I?

570
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,240
I didn't get the points, right?

571
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,180
Toki, you got the points.

572
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,380
We're good.

573
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh my god.

574
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,780
We're good.

575
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,740
Oh my god.

576
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,160
Top 500 is Diamond 2 now.

577
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,200
I'm gonna fucking...

578
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,420
We did it.

579
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,080
Diamond 3.

580
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,820
We can go to bed.

581
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,660
Diamond 2 is Top 500.

582
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,400
We're always just one rank away.

583
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,720
Hello, hello!

584
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:44,980
I think I played like almost 20 hours of Marvel Rivals the last two days on stream.

585
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,180
My brain is like mush right now.

586
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,920
By the way, if you use the code JOKIBERRY, you get 10% off.

587
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,600
I've been on Gamersubs this entire Marvel Rivals grind just to like lock in and stay awake.

588
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,020
Clearly the only reason I'm able to function right now.

589
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,900
Back to back.

590
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,400
You're fine.

591
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,480
You're fine.

592
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,240
You're so fine.

593
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,900
You're so fine.

594
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,070
I don't feel fine no more.

595
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,190
I feel fine again.

596
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,130
I am so healthy.

597
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,970
We're dancing!

598
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,290
Cause we're dancing!

599
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,350
Dance your pain away!

600
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:32,330
You'll eventually get Top 500, JOKI, if you just keep dancing.

601
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,530
Nice, we did it!

602
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,010
Three games, chat.

603
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,930
Three fucking games.

604
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,870
Three fucking games.

605
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,110
Yes!

606
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,850
Two more fucking games!

607
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,270
And then only three.

608
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,430
It's fine.

609
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,370
Yay!

610
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,370
Oh my, is this it?

611
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,030
I need, oh my god.

612
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:01,850
One more game.

613
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,130
One more game, guys.

614
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,590
One more game.

615
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,530
No again!

616
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,250
That's right!

617
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,170
Whoa, okay.

618
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:13,850
That's it.

619
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,330
That scared me, though.

620
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,190
Wait, is this it?

621
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,430
Oh my god.

622
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,970
Oh my god!

623
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,330
Beat him up!

624
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,110
Beat him up!

625
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,530
I'm gonna fucking start fisting!

626
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,770
Beat him up!

627
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,270
Fuck you!

628
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,370
Yes!

629
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,790
I win two!

630
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,630
Wait, is that it?

631
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,010
47!

632
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:38,870
No!

633
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,890
I need one more!

634
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,050
I hope we're lucky, guys.

635
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,490
I hope we're lucky.

636
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,070
I hope we can be lucky.

637
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,850
There's no plat players in here.

638
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,870
There's a grandmaster?!

639
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,410
Bro, why does the enemy team have a fucking grandmaster?!

640
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,270
He's rank 41?!

641
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,230
Of course my top 500 game has to be, like, the hardest game.

642
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,950
Both teams are stacked as fuck.

643
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,910
I'm just getting Iron Man in the back, so I gotta heal.

644
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,690
No, Iron Man will...

645
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,850
Stop him, stop him, stop him.

646
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:19,410
Maximum!

647
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,510
Okay, okay.

648
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:21,730
Nice.

649
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:25,310
I won.

650
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,150
We're dead.

651
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,150
Oh yeah.

652
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,290
They don't live.

653
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,410
Let me get in there.

654
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,590
Let me get back.

655
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:41,850
Like this.

656
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,090
Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.

657
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,030
Oh my god.

658
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,510
First Nunu ult.

659
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,910
Suck buddy.

660
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:49,810
No!

661
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:50,930
No!

662
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,550
Oh.

663
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,990
Oh no!

664
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,890
I wasted it too.

665
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,530
Oh, I didn't think I'd get hit by that.

666
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,980
Oh.

667
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,040
Oh my god.

668
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,100
They all die so fast.

669
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,120
Oh!

670
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,300
He didn't stun him!

671
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,420
Oh my god.

672
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,500
Alright, I'm going up.

673
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,480
Woah!

674
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,440
Nice!

675
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,320
What is this?

676
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,340
Oh!

677
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,380
Alright, I'm going up.

678
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,080
Hulk is red.

679
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,940
Hulk one, Hulk one!

680
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,700
Nice.

681
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,360
I'm dead.

682
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,330
Do you have a Nunu ult though?

683
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:45,770
Do you have a Nunu ult?

684
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,250
Nice.

685
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:48,770
Nice.

686
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,230
I'm not dabbing, I'm not dabbing.

687
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,410
Oh!

688
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,370
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

689
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,130
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

690
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,890
Come back, come back.

691
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:03,970
I'm on, I'm on.

692
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,170
This side.

693
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:09,870
Starlord, Starlord.

694
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:13,830
He's low, he's low.

695
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,750
Oh, nice.

696
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,530
Oh my god, is that it?

697
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,610
Is that it?

698
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,850
Oh my god.

699
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,310
Did we do it?

700
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,310
Did we do it?

701
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,310
Is it over?

702
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,410
Is it over?

703
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,590
I don't know.

704
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,650
Is that it?

705
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:28,890
Yes!

706
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,030
Guys!

707
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,910
Grandmaster to get here.

708
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,530
I literally beat a Grandmaster to get my ELO.

709
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,190
And I played so well.

710
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,550
I played so fucking well.

711
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,050
And that's how I did it.

712
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:06,630
That's how I became the very first VTuber to touch Top 500 in the world for Marble Rivals.

713
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,270
Back then, that was Diamond Top 500.

714
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,910
Now, we're in One Above All.

715
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,630
So, the grind never stops.

716
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:24,230
Tune in next time to see how I become the very first VTuber to end in One Above All Top 500 for Marble Rivals Season 0.

717
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,770
And I played with the rank 1 player to get there.
