00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,600
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,840
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,580
Today is a chill working day.

4
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,460
I am low energy Doki T.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,860
And we have Doki Amber Doge dad here today with us.

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,420
Because usually we don't get to bring him out a lot, often.

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,080
Because, you know, he takes up a lot of my head space.

8
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,520
So, normally he's not there often for streams.

9
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,080
Just because, like, you know, I have to be down here when I'm talking or when I'm streaming.

10
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,160
But today I feel like, you know, a rare occasion.

11
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,180
Since this is a Guerrilla stream, this is a little hangout stream with you guys while we're trying to be productive together.

12
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,660
I decided to bring him out for us today.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, he makes me feel very short and I don't like that.

14
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,060
I need to be tall and superior!

15
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,540
But today is, like, today he gets to be here.

16
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,480
He gets to sit on top of my head today for a more chill relaxing stream.

17
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,520
Okay, so before we actually start being productive...

18
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,860
I shall...

19
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,300
I shall give you guys a life update as to why I had to cancel my stream on Saturday.

20
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,860
I told the reason why on my member stream on Sunday.

21
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,020
I was like, yesterday, but today's Tuesday.

22
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,720
So I realized that things are a little fucky right now with my scheduling.

23
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:24,280
So on Sunday, I gave the reason why I was not available on Saturday and how I got sick.

24
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,860
So, basically...

25
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,300
So...

26
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,540
Not to make you guys feel alarmed, I'm okay.

27
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,780
Because on...

28
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:55,860
So, basically what happened is that on Friday, all I had for lunch on Friday was a giant chocolate Easter bunny.

29
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,780
Because I bought that giant chocolate Easter bunny...

30
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,180
After Easter, because it was on sale.

31
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,700
And I was like, oh, I haven't had a chocolate bunny in a long time.

32
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,520
And then it was a giant chocolate Kinder Surprise Easter bunny.

33
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,420
And I was like, oh my god, you know what?

34
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,280
This Easter bunny has been sitting here for a couple of days now.

35
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,340
For maybe a week or two now.

36
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,520
I should really eat it, you know?

37
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,340
I should try it out, because I haven't had it in a long time.

38
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,640
I haven't had an Easter bunny Kinder Surprise in a long time.

39
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,640
So I was like, om nom nom nom nom nom.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,740
I was like, woah, this is actually really good.

41
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,580
Om nom nom nom nom.

42
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,720
And then I still kept eating it.

43
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,260
And I didn't break it open, I just chomped it down.

44
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,360
And I was like, oh man.

45
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,740
Oh, but like, I shouldn't put this in the fridge.

46
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,380
I might as well keep eating it.

47
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,700
I shouldn't.

48
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,520
I mean, it's there.

49
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,440
It would be foolish to just keep this in the fridge.

50
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,520
It's not going to taste as good, you know?

51
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,480
So I was just like, om nom.

52
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,360
And then, you know, there's still like a piece of chocolate left.

53
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,060
And I was like, oh, I don't feel so good.

54
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,240
Oh man, but like, it'd be such a waste to put such a tiny piece in the fridge.

55
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,940
I might as well finish it.

56
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,920
I might as well just finish it.

57
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,280
Makes sense.

58
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,340
Like, I can't just put this in the fridge.

59
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,340
Like, it's such a tiny piece.

60
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,080
And so, um, and then, you know, I did not feel so good right after.

61
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,220
Because that's all I ate for lunch.

62
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,900
I was talking to my friend while this was happening.

63
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,320
And then I was like, oh man, I don't feel so good.

64
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:02,220
And then my friend was like, of course you don't feel- you ate a whole chocolate Easter bunny!

65
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,520
And you didn't- that's all you ate for lunch.

66
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,160
So, let me give you a visual.

67
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,880
So I'll give you guys a visual on how, um, fucked up I was.

68
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,120
Okay, so, don't worry.

69
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:18,880
Don't worry.

70
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,820
So, um, I showed this on the member stream.

71
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,080
People in the members already know.

72
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,900
Like, they've already judged me, so it's okay.

73
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,980
So, this is how big that bunny was.

74
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,380
I already opened it.

75
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,760
You can see I was already eating it.

76
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,380
While I was taking, like, pictures for my friend.

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,680
I was, like, showing this to my friend.

78
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,160
And so this is, like, the size of it.

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,100
And then, and I got here, and I was like, I don't feel so good.

80
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,380
I don't feel so good.

81
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,720
And then, and then I got here.

82
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,480
I was just like, oh man, oh man.

83
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,180
I can't put this in the fridge.

84
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,500
There's just this piece left.

85
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,160
I can't, I can't just put this in the fridge.

86
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,480
There's just, look at how much there's left.

87
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,440
There's no reason.

88
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,860
And I might as well just finish it.

89
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,220
I might as well just finish this.

90
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:27,060
I might as well just finish the entire, all of it.

91
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,000
So, well, the story doesn't end here.

92
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,800
You think, like, oh, you had so much sugar.

93
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,040
So, like, on Saturday, you just didn't feel good.

94
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,480
Because, like, that's all you had.

95
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,840
Like, your tummy hurt because your entire stomach was just chocolate.

96
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,840
No, that's not the end of the story.

97
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,500
So, like, right after, for dinner, I had Dairy Queen.

98
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,900
Because one of my friends was, like, messaging me.

99
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,760
And I was like, oh my god, Doki.

100
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,940
Guess what?

101
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,140
The S'mores Blizzard is back in the menu.

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,900
And I was like, S'mores Blizzard?

103
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,280
And then my friend was like, yeah, that's their best flavor.

104
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,080
Oh my god, you gotta try it, Doki.

105
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,080
Oh my god.

106
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
And I was like, oh.

107
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,080
I was like, oh.

108
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,640
Oh, they say it's really good.

109
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,200
So, I was like, okay.

110
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,180
So, I ordered a S'mores Blizzard.

111
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,580
But not just a S'mores Blizzard.

112
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,140
I also ordered a Dairy Queen Chili Hot Dog.

113
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,880
So, like, you must be wondering, what?

114
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,360
Dairy Queen sells hot dogs?

115
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,940
Yes, and that's why you shouldn't order hot dogs from Dairy Queen.

116
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,480
Because...

117
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:15,880
You see, ordering a cooked meal from a place that's known for ice cream is not, like, the smartest thing to do in life.

118
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,080
And I learned that the hard way.

119
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,600
So, I...

120
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:30,880
And, like, the thing is, I don't know how long those sausages have been, like, on the grill thingy, on the rotating thing.

121
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,060
I mean, because I Uber Eats it.

122
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,620
So, like, I have no idea how long those sausages have been there for.

123
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,640
And...

124
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,900
So, you know.

125
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,300
And not only did I have a S'mores Blizzard with my Chili Hot Dog.

126
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,040
But I also had a Moo Moo Latte.

127
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,080
Which is basically, like, a caffeinated milkshake.

128
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,920
So...

129
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Because I was like, you know what?

130
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,920
I should get a drink with this meal.

131
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,520
Because that's what you do, right?

132
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,800
You should always order a drink with your meals.

133
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,900
And I was like, ooh, Moo Moo Latte.

134
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,240
That sounds cute.

135
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,820
So, that's why streams on Saturday were cancelled.

136
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,100
That's why we didn't have any Saturday streams.

137
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,960
I was not feeling so good after that day.

138
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:43,660
I might have mixed up a lot of stuff in my stomach that day.

139
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:50,680
You know, when I woke up on Saturday, I was not feeling like a person anymore.

140
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,980
It was sort of like a post-sugar rush.

141
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,400
Post-sugar rush, I feel like I'm gonna die.

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,480
With a questionable hot dog, too.

143
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,380
It's not just the sugar.

144
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,260
It was also questionable hot dog.

145
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,480
Let's just say it did not go down so well in the end.

146
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:37,960
So yeah, that's why I was missing in action on Saturday and I disappeared for a little bit.

147
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,960
Ink Demon, thank you for the super chat.

148
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,780
Thank you, thank you.

149
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,400
Doki, please get some food.

150
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,780
Thank you for the super chat.

151
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,540
Thank you, thank you.

152
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,900
Medi, thank you for the super chat.

153
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,640
Thank you, thank you.

154
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,420
Here's some money to buy better food.

155
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,340
Please.

156
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,660
Thank you for the super chat.

157
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,120
Thank you, thank you.

158
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,520
Don't worry, I ate real food today, though.

159
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,920
Don't worry, guys.

160
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,500
Today, we had real food.

161
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,340
Guys, don't worry.

162
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,120
No questionable meals today.

163
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,660
Anyway, but yeah, that was my day.

164
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,660
That was my Saturday.

165
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,940
I just wanted to let you guys know why I was missing on Saturday.

166
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,980
Stream schedule was going to be late because, well, I just confirmed my sponsor.

167
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,920
So I was wondering if I could announce it or not.

168
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,740
Because I'm supposed to make the official tweet on the day of the stream.

169
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,160
But then I was like, oh, can I just announce it early since I have a stream schedule?

170
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,080
And they're like, yeah, it's fine.

171
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,840
So I'm going to be doing a co-stream watch along on my own.

172
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,300
This sponsor is going to be on Twitch, by the way.

173
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:49,900
So I am going to be doing a Twitch stream and watching.

174
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,360
I'm going to try and see what it's called again, because sorry.

175
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:03,900
It's an official Samsung event for Samsung Galaxy Gear Cup, Gear Up Cup for the, I believe it's a Call of Duty mobile.

176
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:13,080
So Samsung is hosting a Call of Duty mobile tournament on April 25th.

177
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:21,880
And I'll be, I'm sponsored along with some other streamers to do like a watch along of the tournament itself.

178
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,580
Yeah.

179
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,340
And it's like to advertise their newest phone, like advertise their phone and stuff.

180
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,740
So I'll be doing it on Twitch, though.

181
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,800
So I have a stream on the 11th where they're doing a one hour draft stream, drafting stream.

182
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,920
I don't know, I'm not exactly sure what it is, but what a waste of time and money.

183
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,760
Not mine.

184
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Not my money.

185
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,200
But yeah, that'll be on Friday.

186
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:12,640
So I know, like I said, like, oh, Min and I are going to do a collab on Friday, but we had to move that to Thursday.

187
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,900
So we're actually, our collab is going to be on Thursday instead, because I have my sponsor on Friday.

188
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,860
So I just wanted to let you guys know, because I know some of you guys are like, oh, I can't wait for Friday.

189
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,200
But the schedule did change, it swapped around.

190
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,660
So sponsor is on Friday, but that'll be on Twitch.

191
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,300
And then collab stream is going to be on Thursday instead.

192
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,620
So that's like a little update regarding that.

193
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,720
But yeah, that's basically what my schedule is so far.

194
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,740
I don't know what else to do for the rest of the week.

195
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,980
I'll figure that out either on the stream or later.

196
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,920
And then I know some of you guys are like, Toki, I thought it was over.

197
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,820
I thought you were done with Marvel Rivals, ranked session, the leaderboards.

198
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,180
Why are you... Okay, guys, you don't understand.

199
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
The badge sparkles now, guys.

200
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,800
Like, you don't under...

201
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,360
Guys, you don't understand.

202
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,600
The badge... Okay, no, I will...

203
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
No, you don't understand, it's shiny.

204
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,380
It's different.

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,820
It's the same size, which is above average.

206
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,340
By the way, it's above average size, okay?

207
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,080
But like, it's... No, no, you don't...

208
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,420
Okay, guys, I'm gonna show you guys real quick.

209
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:29,920
I'm gonna...

210
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,180
No, I refuse to let you guys judge me.

211
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,300
I refuse.

212
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,500
I refuse to let you guys judge me right now.

213
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,320
I'll show you why we are making the choice we are making.

214
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,860
Look, we're not playing, I just...

215
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,760
I need to show you, okay?

216
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,480
I need to show you guys why, and you'll understand.

217
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,540
You'll understand now, okay?

218
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,120
I refuse to be judged.

219
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,040
Okay.

220
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,720
Give me a sec, it's loading up real quick.

221
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,100
It'll be fast, guys.

222
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,320
I'm just showing the badge of why I wanted to see if I could get it this season.

223
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,480
Okay.

224
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Okay, give me a sec.

225
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,580
I'm just...

226
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,140
Oh, shit, no, that's not what I...

227
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,640
Whoops, sorry.

228
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,480
Hey.

229
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,060
Don't judge me!

230
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,340
I'm in my shame.

231
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,020
I'm in my hidey box because you guys judged me now.

232
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,680
Look what you did.

233
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,780
I'm in my hidey hole because you guys tried to judge me.

234
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,800
Look at that.

235
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,820
Now, it won't come out.

236
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,700
Now, Dogekitty will never come out because of it.

237
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,460
Alright.

238
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,520
Okay, okay.

239
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,640
Let me show you guys.

240
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,000
Let me show you guys.

241
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,420
Okay.

242
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,560
Okay.

243
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,240
Alright.

244
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, guys.

245
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,200
Okay, so this is like last season, right?

246
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,880
Like, last season.

247
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,460
It's over here.

248
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,700
Guys, this above average badge right here.

249
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,300
Okay?

250
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,320
Like, you understand.

251
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,100
Like, yeah.

252
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,180
It doesn't sparkle.

253
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,180
Look at...

254
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,500
Okay.

255
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,080
So...

256
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,340
Next season.

257
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,440
Next...

258
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:17,780
This...

259
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,740
This season...

260
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,100
It sparkles.

261
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,510
Oh, my God.

262
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,330
Look at the sparkle.

263
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,650
No, no, no, no, no.

264
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,450
It's different.

265
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,450
The sparkle adds more length to the badge.

266
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,150
Guys, it's shiny.

267
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,210
It adds...

268
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,590
It adds more length to it.

269
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,550
It's a must-have.

270
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,110
It's a must-have achievement now.

271
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,910
It makes it longer.

272
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,450
And it also sparkles.

273
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:06,990
Okay?

274
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,450
So this is what I...

275
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,390
This is the plain one that no one gives a fuck about because it doesn't sparkle.

276
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,930
And then you get the sparkler.

277
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,350
It's just a simple bird.

278
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,430
If it shine, I want it.

279
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,170
Thank you for the super chat.

280
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:24,770
Thank you.

281
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,550
Thank you.

282
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,570
Like, alright.

283
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,330
Look at this.

284
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,050
This is what I will have if I don't get top 500.

285
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,410
This is what I could have, guys.

286
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,310
It's...

287
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,390
Oh, my God.

288
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,550
It's so shiny.

289
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,730
It's so shiny.

290
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,150
Look at that.

291
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,490
And it looks longer.

292
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,430
Which, I mean...

293
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,910
To be fair, it's already pretty long.

294
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,710
It's above average.

295
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,830
To be...

296
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,570
To be fair, it's already above average.

297
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,670
But it could be more.

298
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,550
It could be...

299
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,610
It could be more.

300
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:58,950
There you go.

301
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,530
So that's why...

302
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,590
Guys, that's why I'm gonna try...

303
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,110
That's why I'm trying to see if I could make it in, guys.

304
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,550
Even as a man, I think the skyscope is a bit much.

305
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,730
Thank you for the super chat.

306
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,410
Thank you.

307
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,310
Thank you.

308
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,270
Look.

309
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:18,610
Look.

310
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,930
Look.

311
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,170
Look.

312
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:19,690
Look.

313
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,930
All I'm saying...

314
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,290
Not only does...

315
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,210
Not only...

316
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,610
But does yours have lightning come out?

317
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,490
I don't think so.

318
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,010
I...

319
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,590
I don't think so, chat.

320
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,250
Does yours have lightning come out?

321
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,970
So that's why...

322
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,410
That's why...

323
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,950
That's why we're trying again this season.

324
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,690
Because they made it different, okay?

325
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,530
They made it...

326
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,650
Okay, look at how boring this is.

327
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,950
It's just yellow.

328
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:57,910
It's so boring.

329
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,150
But oh my god, look at this though.

330
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,990
Oh, woah.

331
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,470
It's so different, chat.

332
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,750
And it's gonna look so good right here at the top right corner.

333
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:18,330
That takes up 1 18th of the space on the top right.

334
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,290
Oh my...

335
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,170
It's gonna make a big difference, guys.

336
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,530
It's gonna make a huge difference on my banner.

337
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,890
So yes, that is why...

338
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:36,590
That is why we are trying this season to see...

339
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,750
We have literally two days left to see if we can get it.

340
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,910
But I'm like 100 points away.

341
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,350
So like, I don't know, maybe.

342
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,650
But don't worry, after that...

343
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,730
That would be my last...

344
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,310
That would be the last time I try.

345
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,670
I swear to god.

346
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,730
Unless they make it even shinier.

347
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,090
But like, there's no way.

348
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,730
There's nothing else they can add to the badge that'll make it any different, chat.

349
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,230
Unless they change the badge.

350
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,190
They change the badge design.

351
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,690
Maybe make it a little bigger.

352
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,450
Which I don't mind.

353
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,030
I don't care.

354
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,550
But I don't care, to be honest.

355
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,370
Cause like, I think it's the perfect size.

356
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,170
Which is above average.

357
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,810
I already think it's the perfect size.

358
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,750
But if it does get a little bigger...

359
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,910
And like, there's fireworks or something.

360
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,310
Or if the badge starts fucking, I don't know, running around my banner.

361
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,550
Or...

362
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,810
They make it like...

363
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,290
They make it like, I don't know.

364
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,770
It starts fucking going RGB or anything.

365
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,130
I might come back.

366
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,250
I might come back to the top 500 grind.

367
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,130
What about fireworks, rainbow glowing?

368
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,390
But...

369
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,050
But...

370
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,110
For now, this will be the last time.

371
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,850
I swear to god, this will be the last time.

372
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,450
Unless they change the badge.

373
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,430
And like, make it like, I don't know.

374
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,010
More special than the last one.

375
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,690
Make the badge twerk.

376
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,150
Unless the badge starts twerking or something.

377
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,010
It'll be fine.

378
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,670
Unless the badge starts doing the DVD logo.

379
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,770
Where it bounces around my banner.

380
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,190
Trying to hit the corner.

381
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,930
Maybe I'll come back to it.

382
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,410
But for now, that'll be the last time.

383
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,070
I swear to god.

384
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,190
It's just cause it's sparkling.

385
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,850
It's just cause it's that sparkly and shiny.

386
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,810
That's why I really want to get it.

387
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,210
That'll be it.

388
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:33,910
I swear to god.

389
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,990
But yes, that is why I'm trying again for this season.

390
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,490
I only have two days left.

391
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,630
I'll most likely be playing off stream for the last two days.

392
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,410
Just cause like, stream snipers.

393
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,130
And I am playing with like, an Iron Fist player.

394
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,590
So like, you know.

395
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:59,730
Most likely just, you know, pan his Iron Fist when he's streaming.

396
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,010
Cause it has happened before.

397
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,390
But yes, anyway.

398
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,610
Time to actually be productive.

399
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,710
Honey, thank you for the five get the shits.

400
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,850
Thank you, thank you.

401
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,830
Momohaku, thank you for the super chat.

402
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,630
Thank you, thank you.

403
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,870
How do we make Doki fall into the rabbit hole more, guys?

404
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,790
Give some sparkles to our badge.

405
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,690
You genius!

406
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,790
Thank you for the super chat.

407
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,650
Thank you, thank you.

408
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,610
Look, look.

409
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,030
Okay.

410
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,330
I am a simple cat slash bird.

411
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,410
If it shines, I'm in.

412
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,910
That's all it takes for me.

413
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,750
Annoying, welcome to Tomato Farm.

414
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,630
Welcome, welcome.

415
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,050
I really appreciate it.

416
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,050
What else did I write down regarding like...

417
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,950
Oh yeah!

418
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,130
Oh my gosh.

419
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,870
I did like...

420
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,050
I was doing a Hong Kong fan meet on...

421
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,930
Oh my god, what day was it?

422
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,710
On Saturday.

423
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,130
It was super cute.

424
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,150
I was actually very surprised.

425
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:24,730
I talked about it in my member stream, but 80% of the people there at my fan meet for my meet and greet, just my meet and greet, but there's a lot of people there at my fan meet as well.

426
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,130
My panel slash...

427
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,790
My panel there or slash fan meeting.

428
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,330
But my meet and greet was like 80% women.

429
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:42,390
And I was so surprised because my YouTube demographics does not say that.

430
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,130
So I was like, oh my god!

431
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,450
Oh my god!

432
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,910
The demographics was wrong!

433
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,190
My analytics was wrong!

434
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,850
Oh my god, there's so many women here to see me!

435
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,070
Yippee!

436
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,130
Oh my god.

437
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,690
That made me super happy because I was like, oh!

438
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,630
Doki for all ages and genders.

439
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,850
Ladies!

440
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,290
I'm not just a dude bro!

441
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,690
I'm also for the ladies.

442
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,730
God, I love ladies.

443
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,870
Oh, not all ages.

444
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,170
13 and up, please.

445
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,530
13 and up.

446
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,990
Anyway, women are real?

447
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,110
Oh yeah!

448
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,350
And then there was a dad!

449
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,590
A dad came to my...

450
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,130
An actual...

451
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,270
Not Doki Aberdoj.

452
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,630
But like an actual...

453
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,270
An actual dad-dad came to my meet and greet.

454
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,650
And then he was like, oh my god, I love watching you.

455
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,270
You like make me...

456
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,970
You make me so happy and stuff like that.

457
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,870
I was like, aw!

458
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,070
That's so sweet!

459
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,790
Oh my god!

460
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,050
See?

461
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,330
Doki for all...

462
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:02,650
No.

463
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,030
Doki for 13 and up ages.

464
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,110
Yippee!

465
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,630
Right up to 15%.

466
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,710
Thank you for the super chat, Zero.

467
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,970
Thank you, thank you.

468
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,850
I really appreciate it.

469
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,510
Yeah!

470
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,490
But yeah, he was like, oh yeah.

471
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,170
It was so sweet because he was like, oh yeah.

472
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,130
I was like really...

473
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,650
I was really in a rough place in my life.

474
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,950
And then I started watching you.

475
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,270
And then you helped me be so happy.

476
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,950
And cheered me up during some worse moments in my life.

477
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,950
And I was like, oh!

478
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,070
Thank you!

479
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,050
That makes me really happy.

480
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:47,170
That I helped a lot of dragons get past some rough patches in their life.

481
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,310
Like, and...

482
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,870
Despite...

483
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,130
See?

484
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,270
Despite the age.

485
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,990
Despite the age, I am...

486
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,690
I...

487
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,410
What's that word?

488
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:55,910
I'm trying...

489
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,810
I am appropriate for all...

490
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,230
For 13 and up ages.

491
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,270
I...

492
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,470
So, yeah.

493
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,810
That made me really happy.

494
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,790
That like, you know, a lot of people from different backgrounds.

495
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,350
Different parts in their...

496
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,050
Different stages in their life still enjoy my content.

497
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,610
PG 13 and up.

498
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,670
Yeah, if you're under 13, your parent has to watch me.

499
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,970
You have to have a parental...

500
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,750
Parental figure there beside you to watch me.

501
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,330
And also subscribe to me.

502
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,370
Doki is generational.

503
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,410
But, yeah.

504
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,930
That's basically...

505
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,150
That's why I love doing these, like, conventions.

506
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:43,710
And...

507
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,910
I love doing the conventions and, like, meet and greets.

508
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,450
And fan meets around the world.

509
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,710
Because I love meeting my dragons from around the world.

510
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,930
And being able to talk to everybody.

511
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,690
And being able to, like, interact with you guys.

512
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,650
Like, one on one.

513
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,910
And get to know more about each of you guys individually.

514
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,370
In a more personal manner.

515
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,050
I know it's, like, really hard to get my meet and greet tickets.

516
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,730
But...

517
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,580
I hope that...

518
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,430
I hope to keep doing the meet and greets and stuff.

519
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,490
Every year.

520
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,270
So, like, more and more dragons have an opportunity to meet me.

521
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,670
Yeah.

522
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,230
And be able to talk to me and stuff.

523
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,790
Which is nice, you know?

524
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,750
I always love talking to you guys individually, too.

525
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,970
But, yeah.

526
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,490
This was really fun.

527
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,230
I love doing these types of conventions.

528
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,170
I do a lot of them.

529
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,490
I am, like, trying to not do too much this year.

530
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,870
Because I got, like...

531
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,450
It was...

532
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,430
I was so fully booked last year.

533
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,670
Like, I feel like I had a convention...

534
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,810
A convention every month.

535
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,510
Two conventions almost every month.

536
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,090
And I was, like, so tired last year.

537
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,210
So, I'm trying to do less this year.

538
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,690
Just so I can keep up my energy throughout 2025.

539
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,430
Yeah.

540
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:47,950
I went hard.

541
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:48,730
Because I never...

542
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,530
I never had this much of an opportunity to do conventions before.

543
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,670
It was really difficult to be picked, in a way.

544
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:58,750
So, like...

545
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,870
To be picked to be able to do a convention.

546
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,210
So...

547
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,650
Because it's, like...

548
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,610
Like, you know...

549
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,970
Management picks for you and stuff.

550
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,370
So, you know...

551
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,350
You obviously don't have a choice if you can or can't do it.

552
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,410
So, that's why I'm, like, really happy to be able to actually do so many conventions.

553
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,270
And meet so many of you guys.

554
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,990
Without having to, like...

555
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,250
You know?

556
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,850
Without any, like, sort of restrictions and stuff.

557
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:30,790
Because I basically make my own rules regarding how the convention...

558
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,750
Like, my panel goes.

559
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,810
And how many people I want to meet.

560
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,550
And, like, the time.

561
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,910
I actually get to pick the time limit, too.

562
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,770
Regarding meet and greets.

563
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,970
And I try to do it for at least...

564
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,090
My personal request is that I always want to do...

565
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,990
For meet and greets, I always want it to be at least two minutes.

566
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,470
Because I think one minute is a little too short.

567
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,470
Sometimes, one minute does get through.

568
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,550
But then I would be like...

569
00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:00,430
Oh, next time, if you want me as a guest, I will want to have at least two minutes.

570
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,950
To be able to talk to my fans.

571
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,670
I don't really care about the pricing.

572
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,590
I just want two to three minutes to talk to my fans.

573
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,690
So they get to talk to me longer.

574
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,090
Especially if it's a paid meet and greet.

575
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,690
I don't mind it.

576
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:22,330
And I'd rather be able to talk to more...

577
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,310
I know you talk to less people.

578
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,410
But I'd rather have each person have a better...

579
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,710
Have a more memorable opportunity to have a one-on-one talk with me.

580
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,630
Than talking to more people in one hour.

581
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,690
And I usually always go over time too.

582
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,630
It is very tiring too.

583
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,310
Because I remember sometimes I would go one hour over time.

584
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,010
And I'd be super tired at the end.

585
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,310
But I feel like it's worth it.

586
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,650
It's worth it.

587
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,630
Because you guys paid to see me.

588
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,430
And a lot of people might be their first time talking to their Oshi.

589
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,350
So I want to make it a more memorable time.

590
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,530
In general.

591
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,410
So yeah, it's quality over quantity.

592
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,110
That's why I do a lot of these appearances.

594
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,150
Just because like, you know.

595
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,430
I like just hanging out with my Dragoons a lot.

596
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,090
And, you know.

597
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,270
YouTube means not forever.

598
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:19,650
So, I never got a chance to see my Oshi Daft Punk at his...

599
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,710
At their...

600
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,370
I know what it was like.

601
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,670
To never be able to see your Oshi.

602
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,850
Before they retired.

603
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,790
I never got the opportunity.

604
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:49,470
I never got to see Daft Punk do their...

605
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,390
Go on their World Tour concert.

606
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,590
Before they disbanded.

607
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,090
I never got to do it.

608
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,470
You don't understand.

609
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,830
Their World Tour concert was beautiful.

610
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,890
And I was...

611
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,230
And I never got a chance to see it live in person.

612
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,870
And then I was like, when I get a little older.

613
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:23,070
I'll be able to afford to see their World Tour concert when they do their next one.

614
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,710
But I didn't know.

615
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,310
There will never be a next one.

616
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,850
There was never a next one.

617
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,550
I was so...

618
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,310
I was like, after their last World Tour concert.

619
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,050
And their fucking Giant Pyramid DJ set up.

620
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,770
I was like, next time I'm gonna be there.

621
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,870
I will be there in the audience to see this live.

622
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,270
Little did Pastor Hebert knew.

623
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,690
There was never a next time.

624
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,890
There was...

625
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,070
There was never a next time.

626
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,790
So...

627
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,750
So...

628
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,910
So like, I don't want you guys to experience that too.

629
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,570
So that's why I do a lot of...

630
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,350
I do a lot of these meet and greets.

631
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,990
And a lot of these...

632
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,690
I do a lot of these conventions.

633
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:18,590
So you wouldn't get to experience the pain I had.

634
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,850
When I...

635
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,890
When I was not old enough.

636
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:30,190
To be able to afford to see the Daft Punk World Tour concert.

637
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,830
Not knowing it was the last one.

638
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,090
Bro, they're like 60 or something.

639
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,110
I don't want...

640
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,130
I said Toma.

641
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,010
Oh my god.

642
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,550
I know their real names too.

643
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,830
Yeah, they're like 50.

644
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,170
Okay.

645
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,410
They're like 50, but there's still a chance.

646
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,150
There's still...

647
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,350
Docs.

648
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:57,570
That's right.

649
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,090
Guy Manuel and Toma.

650
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,970
I know their real names.

651
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,150
That's how much of a fan I am.

652
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,130
Not the docs.

653
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,330
Gabbit, what do you mean?

654
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,670
You're here forever with us.

655
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,150
You're right.

656
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:18,910
You're right.

657
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,450
You're gonna be in your retirement home.

658
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,130
Still watching.

659
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,690
Still watching me.

660
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,690
Thank you for the...

661
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,430
Because I'm eternal.

662
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,630
Thank you for the super chat.

663
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,030
Thank you.

664
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,830
Thank you.

665
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,610
Gabbit.

666
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,330
Burrito, thank you for the super chat.

667
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:30,690
Thank you.

668
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,310
Thank you.

669
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,010
Doki, we all saw the Pokemon collab.

670
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,670
Thank you for the super chat.

671
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,190
Thank you.

672
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:36,510
Thank you.

673
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,150
That's why it's PG-13.

674
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,090
It was all PG-13, guys.

675
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,330
But yes.

676
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,090
I'm thinking about Daft Punk right now.

677
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,890
Because I saw the Fortnite rumors.

678
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,050
That Daft Punk is gonna be the next guest for the concert.

679
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,610
For the Fortnite concert.

680
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,810
And like...

681
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,210
That's all.

682
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,050
I'll take anything.

683
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,250
Guys, I'm that desperate.

684
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,110
I will fucking watch a Fortnite concert of Daft Punk.

685
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,830
I know it's not the same, guys.

686
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,850
But like...

687
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,310
I'll take anything I can get, guys.

688
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,230
I will...

689
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,450
Thank you for the crumb.

690
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,470
Oh my god.

691
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,430
This will feed me for 10 more years.

692
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,710
Oh my god.

693
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,710
A little small crumb for me.

694
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,270
Thank you.

695
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,030
Oh my god.

696
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,930
That will feed me for 10 more years.

697
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,950
Thank you so much, Daft Punk.

698
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,930
Oh my god.

699
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,630
We're gonna feast.

700
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,870
It shall be a national holiday.

701
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,730
For the great news.

702
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,490
For all Daft Punk fans around the world.

703
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,650
But yes.

704
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,690
Apparently...

705
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,470
I was like researching the leaks.

706
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,450
And...

707
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,370
I was researching the leaks.

708
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,410
And they said it's gonna be on June or something.

709
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,230
And I'll be there.

710
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,330
I will be there.

711
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,530
I will be taking the...

712
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,890
I will make my own private lobby of the concert.

713
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,830
Just to see...

714
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,670
It's only me.

715
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,430
It will just be me and Daft Punk.

716
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,470
Watching the concert together.

717
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,990
I will be there.

718
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,890
No matter what.

719
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,250
I swear to god.

720
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,150
It won't be like the Eminem concert.

721
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,050
Where it fucking crashed.

722
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,970
The moment...

723
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,990
The moment he starts singing.

724
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,890
And then it crashed.

725
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,330
Oh my...

726
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,510
That was so sad.

727
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,910
This time it will be different.

728
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,910
It will be different, guys.

729
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,570
I will be able to watch the entire concert.

730
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,450
For those who don't know.

731
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,490
I am a Daft Punk superfan.

732
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,170
How much of a superfan am I?

733
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,430
Well, I would buy almost all their...

734
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,510
When they first opened their Daft Punk website.

735
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,050
And I would buy a majority of the merch on their website.

736
00:36:59,430 --> 00:36:59,930
So like...

737
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,010
Their launching...

738
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,210
I remember their launch products.

739
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,670
Was like the Daft Punk belt buckle.

740
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,570
And then there's posters and everything.

741
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,550
And I even bought...

742
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,430
Daft Punk did like an original art gallery show.

743
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,810
In somewhere...

744
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,810
I don't remember where it was.

745
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,090
But there was an original art gallery show.

746
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,850
Of like different artists that Daft Punk reached out to.

747
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,250
To draw like different illustrations of them.

748
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,110
For an art gallery.

749
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,290
And I didn't buy the original print.

750
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,990
The original, original print.

751
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:27,890
But...

752
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,190
I bought the official like canvas print.

753
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,850
Of one of their Daft Punk paintings.

754
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,190
Of Guy Manuel.

755
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,670
Because I like Guy Manuel more than Tama.

756
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,110
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,530
His helmet was just so much cooler.

758
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,990
And it cost...

759
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,370
It was...

760
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,810
And I remembered...

761
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,430
I saved...

762
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,430
I like...

763
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,190
At that time...

764
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,450
I saved up a lot of money for it.

765
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,850
I literally like...

766
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,870
It was like a lot of money.

767
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,620
Because it was...

768
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,130
It might have been a thousand dollars.

769
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,390
It was...

770
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,950
It was a thousand dollars for an original canvas print.

771
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,990
Of one of the art gallery pieces.

772
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,970
Because they only sold a limited of 50.

773
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,530
Of the canvas print.

774
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,990
And then I had to have it.

775
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,670
No, you don't understand.

776
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,150
Let me...

777
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,730
I'll show you guys.

778
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,490
I still...

779
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,450
It's like locked up in a box somewhere.

780
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,850
Because I was gonna...

781
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,110
I'm gonna display it again.

782
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,270
I have a picture of it when I displayed it in my apartment.

783
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,200
But like...

784
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,330
Okay, let's see.

785
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,670
Daft Punk art gallery.

786
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,290
Alright, let me show you guys.

787
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,430
I shall...

788
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,910
I'll show you.

789
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,910
Oh, I still remember.

790
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,050
It was NME.

791
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,390
I think that was it.

792
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,910
And like...

793
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,510
I had...

794
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:42,970
I used...

795
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,610
I displayed it when I first got it.

796
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,310
But...

797
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,490
Oh my god, it's this one.

798
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,890
Oh my god, I still...

799
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,850
Oh my god.

800
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,890
Oh my god, I remember it.

801
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,410
They actually have it in...

802
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,670
It's called the Rediscovery Exhibition.

803
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,970
And this was the print I got.

804
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,430
I don't know...

805
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,450
I don't remember if I ever showed this to you guys.

806
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,670
On stream.

807
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,750
But this was the original canvas print that I got.

808
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:07,730
Here we go.

809
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,770
I got this one.

810
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,810
And I had it displayed in my apartment when I received it.

811
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,570
Because I love Guy Manuel so much.

812
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,430
Like, Guy Manuel...

813
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,850
Like, you have to love both equally.

814
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,550
And I was like, no.

815
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,290
I clearly have a favorite.

816
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:27,790
I...

817
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,030
So, I have this canvas print.

818
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,350
And it was like around $1,000.

819
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,570
Because they only had like, I think, $50?

820
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,310
They only like, sold $50 or so.

821
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,330
And I had to get this one.

822
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,550
I was like, it's so pretty.

823
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,010
And...

824
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,250
And also like, I have...

825
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,550
I actually have a replica of Guy Manuel's helmet.

826
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,530
And it has all the LED stuff.

827
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,890
So, it's like a mismatch of like, the 19...

828
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,530
Oh my gosh, I don't remember the helmet.

829
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,310
So, it's a mismatch.

830
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,690
Because it's not like an exact replica.

831
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,530
Because I love the LED stuff.

832
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,270
No, sorry.

833
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,650
Guy Manuel's original helmet.

834
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:26,630
With the smile.

835
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,030
Like, it can do like, rainbows.

836
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,250
And then the smiley.

837
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:34,230
And then the little like, the green like, heartbeat and stuff on the side.

838
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,390
But that is like, only one.

839
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,630
Like, oh my gosh, let's see.

840
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:38,210
Daft Punk.

841
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,230
Daft Punk helmet.

842
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,370
I wanted to show a picture.

843
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,270
But there's a reflection.

844
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,110
So, I can't.

845
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,230
Over the years.

846
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,690
Okay, let me...

847
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,970
It's been a while since I...

848
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,090
Look, they retired for a long time ago.

849
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,250
So, my helmet that I have.

850
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,830
It's not an exact replica.

851
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,390
Because I love the Discovery helmet.

852
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,210
So, let me give you guys.

853
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,250
I love the Discovery helmet.

854
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,910
The original Discovery helmet.

855
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:13,050
But also, I love the helmet design.

856
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,710
Of their newer helmets.

857
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,210
I can't believe it.

858
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,530
Okay, I need to like, make it smaller.

859
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,630
Because it's so big.

860
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,790
It's such a big file, guys.

861
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,270
I know this is supposed to be a chill working stream.

862
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,310
And like, there's a...

863
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,710
I started talking about Daft Punk.

864
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,050
So, I have to talk about...

865
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,590
Sorry, Tama.

866
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,130
I don't care.

867
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,830
So, my helmet that I have.

868
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,770
Is a...

869
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,210
It's basically...

870
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,130
Discovery helmet.

871
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,850
Mixed in with Human After All.

872
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,530
So, it has the wires from Human After All.

873
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:00,470
And then, the design and colors of Human After All.

874
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:04,850
But, it has the LEDs of Discovery.

875
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,470
So, because I love the LEDs feature.

876
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,650
Of the original helmet.

877
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,210
I also have the MediToys.

878
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,470
Of two of the Daft Punk figures.

879
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,930
And I have like...

880
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,510
I think I have the Tron one.

881
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,010
Sorry, they didn't make a Grammy.

882
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,070
I have the Tron one.

883
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,910
And the Tron cameo.

884
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,450
Sorry, I got the Tron cameo.

885
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:32,790
And the Grammy figures of them.

886
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,310
Which were really expensive back then.

887
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,010
Wait, let me see.

888
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,230
Let me see what they look like.

889
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,970
Tron Daft Punk figures.

890
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,090
I think they're called...

891
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:44,570
Oh, sorry.

892
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,150
MediCom.

893
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,310
Yeah, they're called MediCom.

894
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:49,850
These guys.

895
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,550
I have...

896
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,970
I have these figures.

897
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,270
And they're really hard to get.

898
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,670
Because they only made a super limited amount.

899
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,090
Guys, no, you don't understand.

900
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,430
I love them so much.

901
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,110
You don't...

902
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,410
I have these.

903
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,650
I have these figures.

904
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,490
And I also have the Grammy ones too.

905
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,190
And they're like...

906
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,510
How much?

907
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,770
Oh my god, they're $2,000 now.

908
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,570
Oh my god.

909
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,070
These figures are now $2,000.

910
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,410
Holy shit.

911
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,850
Oh my god.

912
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,250
Okay, they were not $2,000 when I first got them.

913
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,250
They were like...

914
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,570
I got them for retail.

915
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,290
I got them because...

916
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,130
I bought them in Hong Kong when they first came out.

917
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,810
And they were like retail prices.

918
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,670
Holy shit.

919
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,690
They're $2,000 now?

920
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,670
Oh my fucking god.

921
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,110
That's crazy.

922
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,430
Sorry.

923
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,250
Knowing that they're $2,000 now is actually insane.

924
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,410
Oh my god.

925
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,750
I did not get them for $2,000.

926
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,470
It's insane.

927
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,650
Okay, I also have this one too.

928
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,730
Apparently, these are $500 for one.

929
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,990
I also have these figures.

930
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,910
They're apparently now $500 for one of them.

931
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,050
But I have both of them.

932
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,750
And I also have...

933
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,090
I also have...

934
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,930
Which one is the...

935
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,450
Oh my god.

936
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,590
Where's the Grammy ones too?

937
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,090
I have the Grammy ones as well.

938
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,010
Where is it?

939
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,250
I need to find a better picture of the Grammy ones.

940
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,190
Is it mint?

941
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,350
They're all in their boxes.

942
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,810
I only took...

943
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,370
Well, the Tron one, I took them out for display.

944
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,350
This one is in their box because I never had time to take them out.

945
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,150
And I think the Grammy ones are also in the boxes as well.

946
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,030
Oh wait, I have this one.

947
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:07,150
Oh wait, no.

948
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:10,630
Do I have Random Access Memories or the Grammys?

949
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,810
I think I have the Random Access Memories.

950
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,970
No, I have RAM.

951
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,490
I didn't have the Grammy ones.

952
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,210
I had the RAM one.

953
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,170
So, this is the other one I have.

954
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:20,910
I have this one too.

955
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,550
I have these two.

956
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,950
And I don't know how much they are now.

957
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,730
But I have these guys as well.

958
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,710
And...

959
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,350
These guys, I know they're in their boxes.

960
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:45,290
I also have a replica of the triangle necklace that Guy Manuel wears as well.

961
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,990
Because I thought it was really cool.

962
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,990
And so I also have, like I said, the merch.

963
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:57,690
When they first did their store launch, I bought all their merch on their store launch.

964
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:00,750
So I bought the Daft Punk belt buckle.

965
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,110
And then I have all the prints they had on the store.

966
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,690
Like all the official store launch prints that they sold.

967
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,090
I see Daft Punk.

968
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,370
Store launch.

969
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,030
Merch.

970
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,410
Let me see if they still kept...

971
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,790
And the shirts too.

972
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,270
I had the shirts and everything.

973
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,110
I don't even know if they still have like...

974
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:23,670
Oh my god, this is what they had when they first launched the store.

975
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,290
And I bought like...

976
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:27,710
I bought like...

977
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,710
There's the patches.

978
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,890
The iron-on iron-on patch.

979
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:31,790
The shirts.

980
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:32,590
The prints.

981
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,010
The belt buckle.

982
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,750
And like...

983
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,850
I'm sorry, I had a problem.

984
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,970
Guys, you don't understand.

985
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,690
I take any crumb they'll give me.

986
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,990
You don't understand.

987
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,510
Every time...

988
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,050
They would like occasionally update their website.

989
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,670
To play with my heart.

990
00:46:59,150 --> 00:46:59,710
Like...

991
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,150
Sometimes...

992
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,230
Sometimes they'll add something on the website.

993
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,670
And then I'll be like...

994
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,610
Is it a tab?

995
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,710
And then it's just...

996
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,990
They just try to milk their fans even more.

997
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,090
And then I fall for it every time.

998
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:12,710
I...

999
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,290
I let them milk me.

1000
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:16,590
I...

1001
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:23,430
I...

1002
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,370
I take anything I can get.

1003
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:28,790
I take anything they'll give me.

1004
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,340
I'm just like a...

1005
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,740
I laugh at Nintendo fans.

1006
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,140
But I'm just like them.

1007
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,460
But worse because my Oshi's dead.

1008
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:41,920
My...

1009
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,300
I'm worse.

1010
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,700
My Oshi's dead.

1011
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,730
And I'm still giving them my money.

1012
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:56,750
I'm...

1013
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,810
I'm still giving them my money.

1014
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:00,390
Guys.

1015
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:01,210
No.

1016
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,510
They're dead.

1017
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:03,090
Okay.

1018
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:04,850
You were not there.

1019
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:05,650
Alright.

1020
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,130
I know some of you guys are like...

1021
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,430
Were not there.

1022
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,290
When they posted their retirement video.

1023
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,670
They...

1024
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:14,950
You were not there.

1025
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,410
The retirement video that Daft Punk posted...

1026
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,910
Was literally the two of them...

1027
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:22,210
Fucking exploding.

1028
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,470
Like...

1029
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,450
Dude.

1030
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,490
They actually fucking died.

1031
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:27,850
Like...

1032
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,450
And I fucking cried.

1033
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,650
I was so sad.

1034
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,730
They actually...

1035
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,630
They actually self-destructed.

1036
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,710
I was so sad.

1037
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,170
You're like...

1038
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,050
They're retired.

1039
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:44,690
I was like...

1040
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:44,930
No.

1041
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,350
They're dead.

1042
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:47,650
Like my heart.

1043
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:50,350
Yeah.

1044
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,770
So they used the clip from one of the movies they made.

1045
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,850
That was like based off their robot personas.

1046
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,010
And it's like...

1047
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,590
The movie ends with them literally like...

1048
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,630
Killing themselves by self-destructing.

1049
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:04,350
And...

1050
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,590
And I was like...

1051
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,890
That's how they fucking...

1052
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,010
And then they used that clip to basically be like...

1053
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:12,590
We're retiring.

1054
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,870
And I was like...

1055
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:17,290
I thought that was just the movies.

1056
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:22,390
It was never supposed to be real life.

1057
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,890
I can't believe it.

1058
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,110
It was never supposed to happen in real life.

1059
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:29,490
I thought it

1060
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,160
was...

1061
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,340
They gotta have a backup somewhere.

1062
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,060
They just...

1063
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,160
They must have a backup.

1064
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,560
Just install them a new body.

1065
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,500
But yeah.

1066
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,160
That was basically my...

1067
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,880
Daft Punk obsession.

1068
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,360
If they ever...

1069
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:01,880
I don't know.

1070
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,200
I don't want to have hope anymore in this world.

1071
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,680
If they ever come back.

1072
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,200
I don't know.

1073
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,580
I try not to have too much hope in this world.

1074
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,780
With them coming back.

1075
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,080
I think...

1076
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,420
I think it's better to be pleasantly surprised.

1077
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,900
Than being crushed again.

1078
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,760
Just like last time.

1079
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,120
I'll take my Fortnite concert, guys.

1080
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,760
I'll take my one piece of crumb.

1081
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,180
That they'll give me.

1082
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,280
And I'll be satisfied for another 10 years.

1083
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,280
I'll be happy for 10 more years.

1084
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,140
Let's just say.

1085
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:46,880
Anyway, guys.

1086
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,460
I realized there was no BGM.

1087
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,100
So I'm gonna...

1088
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,320
I'm gonna play some Nintendo...

1089
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,160
Speaking of Nintendo.

1090
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,960
I'm gonna play some Nintendo instrumentals.

1091
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,040
Because we're not gonna be monetized on this.

1092
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,740
They can have my advertising money.

1093
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,140
They can have my ad money.

1094
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,760
No, I'll be too distracted.

1095
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,340
I'll cry if we listen.

1096
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,480
After everything I went through today.

1097
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,160
Blazing, thank you for the magenta soup.

1098
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,340
Thank you, thank you.

1099
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,220
I am a Daft Punk fan as well.

1100
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,980
And was not old enough to see them live as well.

1101
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,600
And I'm super excited for Daft Punk skins in Fortnite as well.

1102
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,320
I was super sad when they broke up.

1103
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,460
Also super happy to follow another fellow Daft Punk super fan.

1104
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,700
Thank you for the magenta soup.

1105
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,480
Thank you, thank you.

1106
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,600
Yeah, I literally...

1107
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,480
I literally saw...

1108
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,920
The Tron movie.

1109
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,440
Just for Daft Punk.

1110
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,840
But then I fell...

1111
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,160
I like...

1112
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,200
Fell in love with the Rinzler design.

1113
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,460
Cause like...

1114
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,860
I don't know.

1115
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,180
It's just something about the helmet.

1116
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,180
It's like...

1117
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,620
I only saw it...

1118
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,340
When you find out who Rinzler is...

1119
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,520
And you're like...

1120
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,880
Put the helmet back on!

1121
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,800
And you find out who he is.

1122
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,540
Never take it off!

1123
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,260
You're so cool with it.

1124
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,220
Sorry, Rinzler.

1125
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,220
You're so...

1126
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,680
With the helmet.

1127
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,480
The helmet stays on!

1128
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,340
Yes, he did!

1129
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,800
The flashback scene ruined it.

1130
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,360
When you find out who he really is.

1131
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,140
I'm like...

1132
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,580
Never take it off!

1133
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:57,700
It does.

1134
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,640
It ruined my immersion.

1135
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,010
It ruined my fucking immersion.

1136
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,240
I didn't need to know who he was.

1137
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,080
I just needed him to keep his helmet on.

1138
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,460
That's all I wanted.

1139
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,360
Like...

1140
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,240
Not gonna lie.

1141
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,740
I was not interested in...

1142
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,720
Majority of the designs.

1143
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,400
And the...

1144
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,760
I wanna say Neutron movie.

1145
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,580
The Tron sequel.

1146
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,540
Because like...

1147
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,120
Because they take off their helmets.

1148
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:34,960
And then...

1149
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,260
I don't know.

1150
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,380
And then Clue was also pretty fucking weird.

1151
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,380
But then when Daft Punk shows up...

1152
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,360
I was like...

1153
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:40,380
Yeah!

1154
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,620
I'm here for you!

1155
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,600
I'm here!

1156
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,440
And then I was satisfied.

1157
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,540
My 30 second cameo...

1158
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,140
Made me happy throughout the movie.

1159
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,260
The 30 second cameo...

1160
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,000
Was enough for me.

1161
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,400
That was...

1162
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:01,540
Yeah.

1163
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,340
That was enough for my entire movie.

1164
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,800
My entire movie journey.

1165
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,000
The best part...

1166
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:09,940
Yeah.

1167
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,700
And then I bought...

1168
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,920
Obviously I have the movie soundtrack.

1169
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,300
I bought the movie soundtrack and everything.

1170
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,940
And I also have...

1171
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,140
I have it on my phone as well.

1172
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,220
I have the songs on my phone.

1173
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,000
God, I love...

1174
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,900
God, I love what they did with the soundtrack.

1175
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,220
Um...

1176
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,240
It was more like 5 seconds.

1177
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:30,900
No!

1178
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,400
No!

1179
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,460
They appeared again.

1180
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,640
They were there for like 30.

1181
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,560
Guys, you can see them in the corner.

1182
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,400
In the corner of the background.

1183
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,580
When they start fighting.

1184
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,060
They could be like...

1185
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,180
And then they start jamming to the music that they're making while they're fighting.

1186
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,240
So it was like...

1187
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,420
It was like 30 seconds.

1188
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,340
They're like right there.

1189
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,680
Oh yeah.

1190
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,060
When Sook's song...

1191
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,400
You know like...

1192
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,800
I saw... You know how like...

1193
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,980
Okay, I didn't watch the direct.

1194
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,200
Um...

1195
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,160
I didn't watch the direct...

1196
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,960
Direct of the...

1197
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,700
When they announced Sook's song.

1198
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,200
And you know how I saw how everybody was freaking out about it.

1199
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,620
So then I saw the clip.

1200
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,200
It was nearly 5 seconds.

1201
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,520
It was like...

1202
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,320
A 5 second cut.

1203
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,800
And then like...

1204
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,000
I was like... Wait, that's it?

1205
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,180
I was like...

1206
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,260
Wait a minute.

1207
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:23,420
That's it?

1208
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,060
I thought...

1209
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,640
And it was like an afterthought.

1210
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,900
It's not like...

1211
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,000
They didn't have their own feature.

1212
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,640
It was just...

1213
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,540
It was just an afterthought in the entire trailer.

1214
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,320
Of like 20 other games.

1215
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,320
The crumbs...

1216
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,960
I'm just like you guys.

1217
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,320
I'm just like you Nintendo fans.

1218
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,720
But at least your game is still alive.

1219
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:47,500
Uh...

1220
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,020
5 seconds.

1221
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,440
But I am full now.

1222
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,040
5 seconds but I am full now.

1223
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,260
5 seconds but I am full now.

1224
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,400
So I'll talk about...

1225
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,200
I know...

1226
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,920
So I'll talk about.

1227
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,220
This always happens when I do...

1228
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:06,820
A working stream.

1229
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,220
I never work because I just want to talk to you guys.

1230
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,500
I'm starving.

1231
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,440
I'm starving for social interaction.

1232
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:29,680
Oh my god, I didn't realize the new Universal Park expansion opened like this week for like test previews.

1233
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,660
Did you guys see it?

1234
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,580
I saw so many clips of like the how to train your dragon island.

1235
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,540
Um, um, that's at the, what was it called?

1236
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:42,480
The, um, Universal, Epic Universal or whatever.

1237
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,040
Yeah, yeah, I didn't realize that was a thing.

1238
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:50,160
I didn't realize that was like being like built for like, how many years?

1239
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,300
For like five years?

1240
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,000
It was being built for five to six years.

1241
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,420
No, it looks so cool.

1242
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,760
I really want to just go to the how to train your dragon.

1243
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,920
There's the how to train your dragon land looks amazing.

1244
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,120
And they actually got like actors who sound just like yeah, the hiccup act.

1245
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,840
Yeah, let me see if I saved.

1246
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:10,120
Oh, I know like I sent it to a friend because I was like, oh my god, this is so cool.

1247
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,740
And then like, they made the little dogs.

1248
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,240
Um, you know, like the dog robots.

1249
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,180
Um, what are they called?

1250
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,500
The, the Boston dog robots.

1251
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,640
They bought one of the Boston dog robots.

1252
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,620
And like, yeah, they're doing test previews like this week or something.

1253
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,200
And like, they put like a fucking dragon.

1254
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,180
They made a dragon.

1255
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,060
I'll show you guys.

1256
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,160
Look, it's so cute.

1257
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:40,000
Oh my god, that's that's literally the Boston dog robots right there.

1258
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,940
And yeah, the Boston dynamic dogs for Toothless's kid.

1259
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,960
And it's so fucking cute.

1260
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,560
Oh my god, I was like, I was like, oh my god, what?

1261
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,500
They're so interactive.

1262
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:02,000
And then there's the one where you can do a meet and greet with hiccup and stuff and hiccup and Toothless and it's so cute.

1263
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,240
Like I love the animatronics for it.

1264
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,500
It's so cute.

1265
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,420
Wait, let me see.

1266
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,580
Epic universe.

1267
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:14,260
Universe.

1268
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,220
Okay, epic universe.

1269
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,700
Let me see if I can find the clip of the hiccup one.

1270
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:23,620
Okay.

1271
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:29,180
Sorry, you might hear like clips of me trying to... Oh yeah, here's the, here's the hiccup actor for the meet and greet.

1272
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,920
They actually have like this accent and everything.

1273
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,020
I was so impressed.

1274
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,160
I was actually and then the animatronic for Toothless looks really cool.

1275
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:44,700
Yeah, I know I really want and then there's one with what's your hiccups his girlfriend?

1276
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,800
I don't remember her name.

1277
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,460
Or wife.

1278
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,800
Sorry, they're married now.

1279
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,680
But there's one with how long the animatronics are actually really, really cool.

1280
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,080
I'm like so impressed by it.

1281
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:57,660
Astrid.

1282
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,720
Yeah, yeah, Astrid.

1283
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:07,360
I'm just incredibly impressed with the, with the design and like the world building of everything.

1284
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,160
It's just so cool.

1285
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,540
I really want to go.

1286
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:18,780
I know it's gonna be like super fucking, it's gonna be like super cramped and everything when it actually goes live.

1287
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,760
Yeah, oh my god.

1288
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,260
And then look at them.

1289
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:25,980
They're so cute.

1290
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,580
They're so tiny.

1291
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,480
Oh my god, they're so cute and tiny.

1292
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:32,940
Look at them.

1293
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:35,700
Yeah, the lines.

1294
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,740
I wish I was famous enough to be at the previews, the sneak previews.

1295
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,500
God damn it.

1296
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,580
Why am I virtual?

1297
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,760
If I was made of flesh, they would have invited me.

1298
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,060
I would be a theme park YouTuber for a day.

1299
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:56,040
If I get to, if I get to see the test previews.

1300
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,860
Then, thank you for the super chat.

1301
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,480
Thank you, thank you.

1302
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,280
Someone made a free dragoon YouTuber model.

1303
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,840
Do I have your blessing to try streaming it a bit?

1304
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,380
Of course, of course you guys can.

1305
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,400
You can use any of the free models.

1306
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,940
Are they dragoon related?

1307
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,020
Of course you can use it, because you're a dragoon.

1308
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:15,940
Thank you for the super chat.

1309
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,800
Thank you, thank you.

1310
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,860
Oh my god, oh my god.

1311
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,860
I'm sorry, I'm just gushing over how cute they are.

1312
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,140
I just, I wish I could, I haven't been to a theme park in so long.

1313
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,460
Because like, I just hate lines.

1314
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:37,320
I just, I hate, I hate, you don't understand.

1315
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:42,360
I hate, I think everyone hates lines, but like, you don't understand.

1316
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:58,880
I grew up so spoiled and sheltered that I never got, I never was raised to like experience, actually experiencing living through a line.

1317
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:11,040
I hate, I was like, okay, so like, like, I was, I was a fast pass kid.

1318
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:30,900
I, if it was possible, my parents and family would always get like the fast pass slash like bypassing all lines type shit, because like, like, they were not patient, and thus they raised a very impatient kid as well.

1319
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,700
So, but I didn't do a lot of theme parks too growing up.

1320
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:51,600
Um, so like, uh, I think, um, I've only, I know I went to Disney World when I was like, six or five.

1321
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:59,580
Like, I think I only went to one American, like I went to one or two American Disneyland's, but I was like six or five.

1322
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,380
So I don't even remember what the fuck I did there.

1323
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:09,140
Like, I don't, and then the other experience I've had at a Disneyland was Hong Kong Disneyland.

1324
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:27,260
And like, I don't know if you guys know that this, but Hong Kong Disneyland is very tiny, and it's so small that you can finish it within a day, especially if you just use, um, if you just use like the fast pass system.

1325
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:33,580
It was, it, you do not stand in line for longer than like 10 to 15 minutes in Hong Kong Disneyland.

1326
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:47,220
And, um, and, um, I think I went, I remember going to the Universal Park, like six years ago, but even then it was not that busy.

1327
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:51,280
Because I think I was stood in line for like, I also was, was with some friends.

1328
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:57,840
So I stood in line for like, at most like 15 to 20 minutes, because we were there during a not busy time.

1329
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,020
So like, I never, I, I just didn't grow up with lines.

1330
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,820
So I'll die in the line.

1331
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:20,020
If you leave this cat in a line for 30 minutes or longer, she'll, she'll just, she'll, she'll just suffer a heart attack.

1332
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,340
She'll die.

1333
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,260
Perish.

1334
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:42,920
Um, but yeah, I just never got a chance to go to like adapt to it.

1335
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,640
So I got, I really, oh wait, no, I went to, I remember Tokyo Sea.

1336
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:51,220
I went to Tokyo Sea, but that was when I was like seven.

1337
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,360
Okay.

1338
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,820
You know what's fucked up?

1339
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:54,260
Okay.

1340
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:59,420
So I remember going to go to Tokyo Disneyland when I was a little, when I was a young bird.

1341
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:08,320
And then I went there like twice and I wanted to go again because, okay, my family used to love to go to Japan a lot growing up.

1342
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,400
I don't remember much from those trips though.

1343
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,320
Cause I was super young.

1344
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,640
Um, and then I wanted to go again.

1345
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,780
I was like, Tokyo Disneyland.

1346
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,580
And they were like, no Tokyo Sea because it's new.

1347
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:21,280
And I was like, but I like, I don't like water.

1348
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,540
I was like, but I don't like water.

1349
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,380
Why do we have to go to Tokyo Sea?

1350
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,480
I don't like water.

1351
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:41,860
I remember I was crying in the tour bus cause, um, it was like a tour group.

1352
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:50,880
And then one, we get to pick to go with the group that goes to Disneyland or the group that goes Tokyo Disneyland or the group that goes to Tokyo Sea.

1353
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,280
And I was like, I want to go to Disneyland.

1354
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,300
And my mom was like, no, we're going to Tokyo Sea cause we haven't been there before.

1355
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,020
You went to Disneyland twice already.

1356
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,440
And I was like, no!

1357
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,640
I was crying in the bus.

1358
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:04,800
I was like, no!

1359
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,940
I want to go to sea!

1360
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,880
I hate the ocean!

1361
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,360
I was just like, I want to!

1362
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,200
I don't like water!

1363
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,000
I want to go to Disneyland!

1364
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,120
And then, but I went to Tokyo Sea.

1365
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:37,760
I don't remember much from it.

1366
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:42,080
Like I said, I don't think I've ever went to, like, theme parks.

1367
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:43,880
Like, other than Universal.

1368
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,520
Universal was the last one I went to.

1369
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:50,640
But like, I think that was the only theme park I went to where I'm like, you know, an adult now.

1370
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,640
Where I'm like an adult.

1371
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,760
So it's been a long time since I've experienced a theme park.

1372
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,200
I think that's also because of COVID.

1373
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,940
No, it's, yeah, it's because, also because of COVID too.

1374
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:12,080
COVID sort of, COVID sort of like, you know, made people not go outside.

1375
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:19,240
No, I don't, I never went to any roller coaster themed theme parks because I'm not a fan of roller coasters.

1376
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,220
And I'm not that fan of roller coasters.

1377
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,160
And I just prefer, I don't know.

1378
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,060
I just, I like the world building of things.

1379
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,540
And stuff, so.

1380
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:34,980
I'm very limited to, like, some of the theme parks that, like, the rides that I want to go to.

1381
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,740
Pearl Land?

1382
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,240
Pearl Land is not a theme park.

1383
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,400
It is an experience.

1384
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,860
It is a lifestyle.

1385
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,640
That doesn't count.

1386
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,260
Pearl Land is a lifestyle.

1387
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,400
It is an experience.

1388
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,620
There's no theme park there.

1389
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:04,060
It is a rite of passage for every Sanrio fan.

1390
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,540
If you are a Sanrio fan, you have to go to Pearl Land.

1391
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,280
But it is not a theme park.

1392
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:19,240
It is like your indoctrination into the land of Sanrio.

1393
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:27,220
And guys, we haven't been productive once at all during this stream.

1394
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:33,780
It just, yes, it is like a pilgrimage.

1395
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,360
It is a pilgrimage for all Sanrio fans.

1396
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,780
Like, it is a requirement to go there.

1397
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,160
Anyway, yeah guys, we haven't been productive at all.

1398
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,100
We should really get going there.

1399
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,160
We should really get started.

1400
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,500
Guys, have you guys done anything while I was talking?

1401
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,240
Because I sure haven't.

1402
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,980
Nah, I mean, though, yeah.

1403
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,980
Alright, let me look at my message.

1404
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,340
I had like a lot of messages I had to go through.

1405
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,740
Oh, fuck.

1406
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:14,380
Oh yeah, I saw people were like, what happened to your... Okay, so, for the member goons, I'm sorry.

1407
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,480
I got... I procrastinated.

1408
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,940
Like, typical Doki fashion.

1409
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:27,380
You know when you have like a lot of stuff going on and then you do none of them because you're just so overwhelmed?

1410
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,520
That was me.

1411
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,300
That was me.

1412
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,640
That was me last night.

1413
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:44,460
And then, like, I did do some stuff because, like, okay, so, my manager has figured out a way that makes me more productive.

1414
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:48,000
In a way that, like, I'll do like 30% of the to-do.

1415
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,380
Like, 30% of the stuff I have to do.

1416
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:56,000
Basically, every other day, he gives me a list and was like, at least do these things.

1417
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,020
And I do like 30 to 40% of the list he gives me every day.

1418
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,820
So, like, not every day, every other day.

1419
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,720
That's why he gives me a to-do list every other day.

1420
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,120
But it works.

1421
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:13,720
But it works though.

1422
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,560
It does work.

1423
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,540
Yoko, thank you for the super chat.

1424
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:19,900
Thank you.

1425
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:20,580
Thank you.

1426
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,980
I walked my dog and start cooking tomorrow's lunch.

1427
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:23,800
Oh, good for you.

1428
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:24,520
Thank you for the super chat.

1429
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:24,820
Thank you.

1430
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,500
Thank you.

1431
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,900
I really wanna start being more healthier starting at least this week or next week.

1432
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,040
I wanna start, like...

1433
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,020
Well, not going outside more.

1434
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,340
That's too much of a big step.

1435
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,060
Baby steps.

1436
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,020
Baby steps, everybody.

1437
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,000
I wanna start...

1438
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:49,540
I wanna start, like, doing more, like, being healthier in general.

1439
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,120
So, like, exercising more and eating healthier and stuff like that.

1440
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,360
And then, one of my friends was like, okay, one at a time.

1441
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,000
Either you eat healthy or you exercise more.

1442
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,000
Start exercising more.

1443
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,200
Because...

1444
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,720
It's trying to do both.

1445
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,680
I know you're gonna give up.

1446
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,320
It's like, let's not get too crazy.

1447
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:12,620
So...

1448
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,440
I don't know if I wanna start eating healthier first.

1449
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:21,260
Maybe start eating healthier first and then we'll slowly do more and more exercising and stuff.

1450
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:24,220
I do have, like, a treadmill in my apartment.

1451
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:28,140
But I also have a building gym.

1452
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,240
In my apartment complex, there is, like, their own gym.

1453
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:40,140
So I was thinking... I feel like I'd be more motivated if I had to go downstairs to, like, the apartment gym.

1454
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,000
And use the stuff there versus just using the treadmill in my own apartment.

1455
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,420
But yeah.

1456
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:53,000
I don't know what to start first, but I wanna try either this week or next week.

1457
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,580
Just to be a bit more healthier.

1458
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,760
Because I haven't been very healthy the last year, almost.

1459
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,820
Just because, like, you know, lots of stuff was going on.

1460
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,300
And then I was just, like...

1461
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,540
I was eating my feelings away.

1462
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,380
Or not.

1463
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,060
Or not.

1464
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,440
I was either eating or not eating.

1465
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,640
It was, like, a mix-match between the two.

1466
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,020
And then, like...

1467
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,040
Also, like, I'm always so fucking busy.

1468
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,900
So it's hard to, like, get exercise in as well.

1469
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,380
Because I've been, like, so fucking busy all the time.

1470
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,080
I wanna start, like, slowly putting that into my scheduling as well.

1471
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,360
I wanna start, like, introducing it back into my schedule.

1472
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:31,580
Let's see.

1473
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,900
Could get wallpaper that's darker sometime soon?

1474
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:38,180
Yeah!

1475
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:40,380
I think, like...

1476
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,860
April's wallpaper will be...

1477
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:46,000
The theme I chose for April will maybe be a darker wallpaper.

1478
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,260
But I definitely will.

1479
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,280
Thank you for the super chat, Tastyus.

1480
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,160
Thank you, thank you.

1481
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,040
I definitely want to go into more variety.

1482
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:56,180
It's just the theming of each month was, like...

1483
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,420
It didn't help as well.

1484
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,160
Because the theming of each month was more so, like, bright colors and stuff.

1485
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,040
Also, yes, I should...

1486
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,500
The first thing I'll do, I'll post a member's wallpaper too.

1487
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,420
For March.

1488
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,980
I'll show you guys the outfit concept.

1489
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,480
Outfit concept is always public.

1490
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,660
But I love the outfit for...

1491
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:15,240
I might...

1492
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,400
I might...

1493
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,180
I might ask...

1494
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:24,180
This artist to design an outfit for me.

1495
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,640
Because, like, I really love her outfit.

1496
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:27,780
It's so cute.

1497
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,140
Wait, let me...

1498
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,360
I really love the outfit design for the Sakura...

1499
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,640
For the March theme.

1500
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,660
Let me see if I can find...

1501
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,000
Okay, let me see where the file is.

1502
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,840
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1503
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,480
Let me grab the file.

1504
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:48,210
Alright, here's the character...

1505
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,570
The concept art for it.

1506
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:53,190
Woah, it's a big file.

1507
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:54,590
Give me a sec.

1508
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:58,510
Can I make it so that transform...

1509
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,190
Fit to screen.

1510
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:05,710
Is that it?

1511
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:07,010
Oh!

1512
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,950
How cute this outfit is, guys.

1513
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:14,030
Wow!

1514
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:16,890
Look at that.

1515
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:18,510
It's such a cute outfit.

1516
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,010
This is for...

1517
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:23,290
This is for the March wallpaper.

1518
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,130
I really like this outfit.

1519
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:26,990
It's so cute.

1520
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:28,270
I think I like the...

1521
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,190
I just like...

1522
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,510
I love the dress shirt combo.

1523
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:32,630
It's really cute.

1524
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:34,410
But yeah, this is the March wallpaper.

1525
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,190
If you guys wanna...

1526
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:36,730
I'll post the wallpaper now.

1527
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:40,410
But if you guys wanna download the wallpaper for March...

1528
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,570
Gotta join the membership.

1529
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:44,210
I try to post the wall...

1530
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:47,810
I try to have member wallpapers every month for us.

1531
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,110
But yeah!

1532
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:49,910
Wow!

1533
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,850
I love the dress.

1534
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:55,910
It's so cute.

1535
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:57,430
Alright, let me...

1536
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,150
Let me...

1537
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:01,790
Post this real quick.

1538
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:05,590
PNG.

1539
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:07,670
There's the PNG.

1540
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:08,630
There's the PSD.

1541
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:13,390
Okay.

1542
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:16,630
Download.

1543
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,050
Did I download it?

1544
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:20,730
Oh, I did.

1545
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:22,030
Oh yeah, I need to upload this.

1546
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:22,910
Okay, work time.

1547
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,370
Work time.

1548
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:30,950
In the right folder?

1549
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:31,610
No.

1550
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:37,950
Aww...

1551
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:39,930
Where are my folders?

1552
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,710
Kaiser, thank you for the super chat.

1553
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:42,570
Thank you, thank you.

1554
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:46,030
Can we expect another drawing or profile pictures within the next six months?

1555
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:46,890
Yes, Kaiser!

1556
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:48,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1557
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:48,790
Thank you, thank you.

1558
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:50,110
Thank you for reminding me.

1559
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:52,570
Yes, we just had like...

1560
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,590
I tried to make the member stream variety.

1561
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:59,230
That's why we haven't had another part three of the profile pictures one.

1562
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:03,150
Because I was trying to make sure there's varieties going on for the member stream.

1563
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,970
But we'll definitely have another one within six months.

1564
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:06,970
Thank you for the super chat.

1565
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:08,870
Thank you, thank you.

1566
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,430
Trying to find where the wallpaper folder is.

1567
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:16,590
So I can upload the newer wallpapers.

1568
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:17,670
Oh, there you go.

1569
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:18,530
Member wallpaper.

1570
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,970
Let me rename this.

1571
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,560
Gonna blow my nose.

1572
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,300
Yeah, I'm still doing the ones from before times.

1573
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,620
I've been like balancing between before times and current.

1574
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,380
Bop bop bop.

1575
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:52,040
Um, what did I name this?

1576
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:54,780
File information.

1577
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:58,180
Okay, members wallpaper for March.

1578
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:58,900
Okay.

1579
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,140
February, March.

1580
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,040
Rename.

1581
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:04,800
Members.

1582
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,620
March wallpaper.

1583
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:08,960
Yippee!

1584
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,360
Share.

1585
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,200
Link.

1586
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,720
Okay, and I have to make the preview file too.

1587
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,560
Yeah, it was supposed to be March, but then the artist was like...

1588
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,600
Got sick, so she's gonna work on it in...

1589
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:29,780
May.

1590
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,820
Um, cause like...

1591
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,560
I missed January's wallpaper.

1592
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,940
So I missed January's wallpaper.

1593
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,560
And she got sick, so her schedule got messed up a little bit.

1594
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,520
So...

1595
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:48,500
Um, she's gonna...

1596
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,720
She's gonna work on it later.

1597
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,960
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

1598
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:56,880
Thank you, thank you.

1599
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,080
Since you mentioned wanting to exercise more...

1600
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,280
Here's hoping you can work your glutes muscles to the point you get the A...

1601
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,760
The A-S-S and thighs that you can be proud of.

1602
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:07,140
Thank you for the super chat.

1603
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,220
Thank you, thank you.

1604
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,100
GenXide, thank you for the super chat.

1605
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,040
Thank you, thank you.

1606
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,760
Um, working on a project for my class.

1607
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:17,280
It's about gorilla marketing and I'm using you for one of my examples.

1608
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,360
Also about to head into Home Depot to pick up some stuff for my...

1609
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,040
For some stuff for my car.

1610
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:24,340
I'm fabricating a wing.

1611
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,480
Thank you for the super chat.

1612
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,300
Thank you, thank you.

1613
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,440
Yeah, hope you manage to...

1614
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,380
Um, get all that done.

1615
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,260
Hope you guys should be productive.

1616
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,740
Not like me though, hehe.

1617
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,340
Where did I put the wallpaper icon?

1618
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:39,280
Wallpaper...

1619
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,360
I have like...

1620
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:41,240
Oh, there you go.

1621
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,260
Wallpaper thumbnail.

1622
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,700
I have like a specific thumbnail that I use for wallpapers.

1623
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:56,890
February...

1624
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:58,870
March wallpaper.

1625
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,500
I forgot my schedule tonight.

1626
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,200
I don't know what to do tomorrow.

1627
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,500
March thumbnail.

1628
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,300
Oh, I'll show you guys the thumbnail for it too.

1629
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,180
This is the thumbnail.

1630
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:23,980
It's cute.

1631
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:26,820
Yay!

1632
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:29,800
That's pretty cute.

1633
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,660
I love working with Japanese artists.

1634
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:37,820
Um...

1635
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,000
Their work is so pretty.

1636
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:56,020
I'll post this here.

1637
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:57,660
And this is the March thumbnail.

1638
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,020
The March wallpaper.

1639
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,500
I always ask them to...

1640
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,860
I try to get them to always include dragons for the wallpaper.

1641
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,640
Cause like, I'm like, you're with me, you know?

1642
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,440
I like having you guys there.

1643
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,520
I think every wallpaper so far has you guys included.

1644
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,240
Yeah, I'm looking through all the wallpapers and all of you guys are always like there.

1645
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:39,810
This is not just me.

1646
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:00,090
What is it?

1647
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,570
Oh, maybe in the future.

1648
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:04,250
I'll have a DoughKitty member's wallpaper next time.

1649
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:08,730
Or not next time, whenever I contact them for the next couple of months.

1650
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:19,230
Alright, let's see.

1651
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:20,910
Oops, I accidentally closed it.

1652
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:25,390
Who said no lube loser?

1653
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:26,450
Thank you for the super chat.

1654
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:27,290
Thank you, thank you.

1655
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:29,790
Alright, post.

1656
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:31,210
Members.

1657
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:36,030
All channel members.

1658
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:41,350
March, and then the concept art too.

1659
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,150
It's not what I wanted.

1660
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:24,390
Okay.

1661
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:31,150
I'm trying to make it so the picture, the entire outfit shows on the...

1662
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:35,250
...membership post thumbnail.

1663
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,760
There it is, DoughKitty outfit.

1664
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,180
Yeah, there it is.

1665
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:57,090
Boom, boom, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, boom.

1666
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:06,270
I know.

1667
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:07,630
Yeah!

1668
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:12,750
Okay, now I copy and paste what I wrote from before.

1669
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:17,230
Edit.

1670
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:28,340
It is... it is Sakura themed.

1671
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,120
And...

1672
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:35,170
Who did the art for this?

1673
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:36,890
I'm gonna look up the artist again.

1674
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:39,910
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1675
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,090
This art.

1676
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:43,830
This person.

1677
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,090
Download here.

1678
01:22:57,730 --> 01:22:58,290
Share.

1679
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:03,650
Share.

1680
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,960
Okay, I have posted it!

1681
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:23,620
Yay!

1682
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:28,100
Alright guys, you can now download the wallpaper!

1683
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,360
It has been posted, everyone.

1684
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,940
If you are a member, good.

1685
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:37,500
The March wallpaper is now out.

1686
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,200
I posted it on the community post.

1687
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:42,540
So you can download it now, guys.

1688
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:43,120
Yippee!

1689
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,580
It's super cute.

1690
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,640
It's really, really cute.

1691
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,080
I like the Sakura blossom.

1692
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:53,720
Because I wanted a Sakura themed... wanted a Sakura themed wallpaper.

1693
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,960
Whatever you want.

1694
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:08,920
Whatever you want.

1695
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:09,880
I have no preference.

1696
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,540
Whatever you feel looks best.

1697
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:15,760
I appreciate it.

1698
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,420
Yeah, it's pretty cute.

1699
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,600
I love the outfit.

1700
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,340
I should make a tweet about it, too.

1701
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,740
Yeah, I'm productive.

1702
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:23,880
Look at that.

1703
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:28,720
Okay.

1704
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,120
Oh, Mac!

1705
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,220
Thank you for the 5 gifted ships.

1706
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,480
Thank you, thank you.

1707
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,280
I really appreciate it.

1708
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,960
I should make this tinier, because it's covering me.

1709
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,780
I'll put it here.

1710
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,740
Like my little advertising space.

1711
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:55,260
Let me just learn to show more.

1712
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,940
I haven't been showing stuff as often.

1713
01:24:59,040 --> 01:24:59,440
Zekka!

1714
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,220
Thank you for the 5 gifted ships.

1715
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,180
Thank you, thank you.

1716
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,700
I really appreciate it.

1717
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:06,040
I'll put it here.

1718
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:07,160
I'll put it here.

1719
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:07,940
I don't know.

1720
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:10,080
I don't know.

1721
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:12,380
Left or right?

1722
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:13,980
Spanish or English?

1723
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,360
Wow.

1724
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:18,700
No, I think it's too crowded on the right.

1725
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:19,620
I'll put it to the left.

1726
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:21,780
Yeah, it's a little too crowded.

1727
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:23,640
Alright.

1728
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,220
Let me make my tweet.

1729
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,060
Also, I'm so sad.

1730
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,400
I don't know if Twitter's broken or like...

1731
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,640
I mean, Twitter's always broken.

1732
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,680
I don't fucking know what to do.

1733
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,440
Who am I kidding?

1734
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,500
Twitter's always broken.

1735
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,600
But I don't know if you guys noticed.

1736
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:53,300
The media tab is like fucked up right now on Twitter.

1737
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,100
So like you can't scroll past 15 images.

1738
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:57,620
And you have to keep like...

1739
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:03,680
If you want to scroll past 15 images, you have to keep refreshing over and over and over again.

1740
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,240
It's so fucking annoying.

1741
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:06,360
I'm just...

1742
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:11,500
It's...

1743
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:13,700
It's so annoying.

1744
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,080
I hate it so much.

1745
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,340
Yeah.

1746
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:24,180
I have no idea what's going on.

1747
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:04,180
Work, work, work, work, work.

1748
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,780
Mike, thank you for the gifted chat.

1749
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:08,720
Thank you, thank you.

1750
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,540
Angrius, thank you for the super chat.

1751
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,700
Thank you, thank you.

1752
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:21,570
Getting ready for this year's Sage I'm Sad?

1753
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:23,090
There's another one this year?

1754
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:24,290
Thank you for the super chat.

1755
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:24,830
Thank you, thank you.

1756
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:25,210
I haven't...

1757
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:28,250
I really... I don't know.

1758
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:29,470
I don't know.

1759
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:30,170
I'm not sure.

1760
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:32,090
Is Sage I'm Sad another one?

1761
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,210
I'm not sure.

1762
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:36,590
Cause like I did the Sage I'm Slam based off of vibes.

1763
01:27:39,010 --> 01:27:41,490
And I guess like the game as well.

1764
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:42,430
Cause like...

1765
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:48,870
I'd rather be on the team that I vibe with the most.

1766
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:50,010
You know?

1767
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:54,930
And it's based off of like... And also if I'm not super overworked too.

1768
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:57,930
Because like Kony was telling me how like...

1769
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:03,530
How he felt he was like so overworked with everything.

1770
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:08,530
Because he joined Twitch Rivals and the Sage I'm Slam at the same time.

1771
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:10,470
So he had no time to practice.

1772
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:14,930
So he chose Twitch Rivals in terms of practicing over...

1773
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:20,490
Over... Cause like he practiced more for the Marble Rivals tournament.

1774
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:21,490
Over like...

1775
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:23,730
Over like...

1776
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,110
What game were they playing that time?

1777
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:26,410
Was it Street Fighter as well?

1778
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:27,330
It was Street Fighter, right?

1779
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:30,190
It was Street Fighter.

1780
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:32,630
So it really depends on like the time too.

1781
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:37,760
I don't know.

1782
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:39,280
It depends on the...

1783
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,260
It depends on who the people are that signed up.

1784
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,100
And also like...

1785
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,300
It's just like vibes for me.

1786
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,180
I enjoy Sage I'm Slam.

1787
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:50,420
I enjoy like...

1788
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:54,440
I enjoy the vibes from the Sage I'm Slam more than like...

1789
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:56,380
The competitive side.

1790
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,920
Oh, I'm munching on a cough drop.

1791
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,460
And the timing well too.

1792
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,380
Yeah, and the game.

1793
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:06,840
Game as well.

1794
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,720
But yeah, there's a lot of factors that go in.

1795
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:48,110
Alright.

1796
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,390
Sorry, I blanked out.

1797
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:54,690
Because I was like, what do I have to do next?

1798
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:55,010
Oh, yeah.

1799
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:56,370
I was trying to post my wallpaper.

1800
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:00,210
The boy who falls...

1801
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:00,750
Fails.

1802
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:01,090
Sorry.

1803
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:02,190
The boy who fails.

1804
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:03,210
Welcome to Tomato Farm.

1805
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:03,530
Welcome.

1806
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:03,970
Welcome.

1807
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:05,170
Exposed.

1808
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:06,170
Thank you for the super chat.

1809
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:06,490
Thank you.

1810
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:07,190
Thank you.

1811
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:13,570
Everyone shall know that I'm watching this at 144p while being on top of the Eiffel Tower eating a baguette with a...

1812
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:16,990
That's how you spend your Tuesday morning.

1813
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:18,090
Thank you for the super chat.

1814
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:18,710
Thank you.

1815
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:19,430
Thank you.

1816
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:19,810
Okay.

1817
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:20,610
Wallpaper.

1818
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:22,630
Thank you for the super chat.

1819
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:22,930
Thank you.

1820
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:23,270
Thank you.

1821
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:24,530
Thank you for the super chat.

1822
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:24,810
Thank you.

1823
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:25,390
Thank you.

1824
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:25,670
Okay.

1825
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:27,470
I have to search up my old tweets.

1826
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:29,430
That's how fucked up it is.

1827
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:29,950
I...

1828
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:33,190
Like, I have to use the search function because I can't...

1829
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:35,070
I can't use my media tab.

1830
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:40,910
I am not refreshing my media tab like 20 times just to find my old membership.

1831
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:42,850
My old, like, wallpaper posts.

1832
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:48,230
Sub Sharky.

1833
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:51,570
Thank you for the five gifted ships.

1834
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:52,610
Thank you, thank you.

1835
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:54,410
I really appreciate it.

1836
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:55,390
Alright, there you go.

1837
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:57,490
I found it.

1838
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:00,170
Yay!

1839
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:03,430
Okay.

1840
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:04,530
There's the march.

1841
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:12,230
It still sucks that I have to, like, search this up every time.

1842
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,480
Bottom, bottom, bottom.

1843
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:21,540
Wallpaper.

1844
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:30,040
And then, I always do, like, the outfit.

1845
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,860
Download the...

1846
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:40,340
March wallpaper.

1847
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,540
Alright, where's the...

1848
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,760
Where's my community post?

1849
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:48,840
There it is.

1850
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,640
Wait, no, that's not it.

1851
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:02,180
Post.

1852
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,300
This one?

1853
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:15,240
No, it should be Eugene.

1854
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,160
Okay, does this work?

1855
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:24,600
Yay, it worked!

1856
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,340
Okay, I'm gonna tweet it out now.

1857
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:31,220
And then, bonus outfit concept.

1858
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:40,790
Oh, let me fix that.

1859
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:49,770
Defected, thank you for the super chat.

1860
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:50,850
Thank you, thank you.

1861
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:52,390
Greetings from Japan, Doki.

1862
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:53,970
So, it's Wednesday morning!

1863
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:55,430
Thank you for the super chat.

1864
01:32:55,490 --> 01:32:56,410
Thank you, thank you.

1865
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:59,170
Good morning over there on the other side of the world.

1866
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:00,410
Morning!

1867
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1868
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:02,870
Thank you, thank you.

1869
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:09,760
Cheat secure.

1870
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,140
Is there one I wanna upload?

1871
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:21,140
Or is it this one?

1872
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,220
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1873
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,080
Which one did I name it as?

1874
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:27,780
I don't remember.

1875
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,140
Oh, it's character sheet Sakura.

1876
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,140
Is it?

1877
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,100
Oh, it is.

1878
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:39,320
Uh...

1879
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,020
More balls!

1880
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:40,600
More balls!

1881
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:42,100

01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,760
And Chris, thank you for the 5 gifted shares!

1884
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:47,920
Thank you, thank you!

1885
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,200
I really appreciate it, guys.

1886
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,200
Thank you so much!

1887
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:51,440
Alright.

1888
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,120
Alright, I'm tweeting about...

1889
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,780
March wallpaper now.

1890
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:58,320
Yippee!

1891
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:00,440
Post all.

1892
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:01,960
Post all.

1893
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,340
That should work, right?

1894
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:06,420
Yay!

1895
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:11,340
Okay.

1896
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:12,880
What's that have to do?

1897
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:18,510
Uh...

1898
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:20,750
Alright, let me answer my Discord messages now.

1899
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:25,110
Um...

1900
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:39,690
Oh yeah, I need to set up my account to be paid.

1901
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:41,910
That's important.

1902
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:47,390
My manager is like, remember to set up this account so you can be paid for your sponsor.

1903
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:47,530
Yay!

1904
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,930
That's something I gotta do.

1905
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:55,050
I gotta do that.

1906
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:22,570
Okay.

1907
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,150
Text me.

1908
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:31,760
Alright,

1909
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:38,750
um...

1910
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,860
I'm...

1911
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,560
Okay, I am a corporation.

1912
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,160
Yes.

1913
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,040
Yay, it works!

1914
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:58,420
Yippee!

1915
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:00,640
Okay.

1916
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,640
Okay, I was really scared...

1917
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,060
Cause like...

1918
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:05,820
Okay, so...

1919
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,020
Without like...

1920
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:09,580
Doxxing myself...

1921
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:14,300
Okay, it's not really doxxing, but like...

1922
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:17,240
I have to use bill.com for one of my...

1923
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,540
So like, this is business talk.

1924
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:23,520
So I have to use bill.com for one of my sponsors to be paid.

1925
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,700
And like, they had to send...

1926
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:26,120
Um...

1927
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:27,290
I tried to like...

1928
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:28,260
Uh...

1929
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:29,240
Log in via...

1930
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:30,120
Google.

1931
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,740
For the account.

1932
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,490
Because bill.com is like...

1933
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,460
Mostly for American payments.

1934
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,020
So like, I got really...

1935
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:38,390
So when I tried to log in...

1936
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:39,860
Um...

1937
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:40,740
Via like...

1938
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:41,420
My...

1939
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:42,440
Like my...

1940
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,880
Via Gmail, like via Google.

1941
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,640
It wouldn't let me put in my company's address.

1942
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:48,620
Which is Canadian.

1943
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:50,260
So I got really confused.

1944
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:50,880
I was like...

1945
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:51,540
What?

1946
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:52,820
It's only...

1947
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:54,340
It's like locked into American.

1948
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:55,800
So, but like...

1949
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,900
The thing is...

1950
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:59,900
The only way Canadian companies...

1951
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,700
Can like...

1952
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:01,880
Register to bill.com...

1953
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,960
Is if they send you an invite...

1954
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:06,200
And you have to create an account...

1955
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,060
On there.

1956
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:09,060
You can't log in via Google.

1957
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:10,040
Uh...

1958
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:10,620
Via Google.

1959
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:12,280
You can use your Gmail and create an account.

1960
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,160
But you log in...

1961
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,420
Via your Google account...

1962
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,420
It locks it to an American address.

1963
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:19,400
So...

1964
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:24,040
So I had to have them...

1965
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:26,480
Send me a new invite...

1966
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,040
To a different email.

1967
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,280
So I can create a Canadian account...

1968
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,240
On that website.

1969
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:35,380
It's so fucking...

1970
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,820
It is so weird.

1971
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:38,060
So I have to...

1972
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:38,780
So I...

1973
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:39,720
So I have to like...

1974
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,340
Go through like several hoops for it.

1975
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:42,520
Yeah.

1976
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:44,400
No, bill.com is like...

1977
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,060
It's like supposed to be like...

1978
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,460
Only American addresses.

1979
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,680
Unless...

1980
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,300
Unless like you get invited.

1981
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,600
Um...

1982
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,720
Business type.

1983
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,260
I am a corporation.

1984
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:03,890
Uh...

1985
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:07,910
Media and entertainment industry.

1986
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:16,890
Um...

1987
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:17,510
Services.

1988
01:38:17,870 --> 01:38:19,750
I'm providing a service.

1989
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:22,090
I use QuickBooks.

1990
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:23,330
QuickBook Online.

1991
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:25,270
Alright.

1992
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:28,570
Yeah, I'm a company technically.

1993
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:30,770
Um...

1994
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:31,890
Cause it's easier...

1995
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:33,610
For taxes.

1996
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:35,250
Tax reasons.

1997
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:36,310
It's also like...

1998
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:38,030
Easier to deal with.

1999
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:39,970
And then like...

2000
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:40,570
Um...

2001
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:42,030
Paying via my company...

2002
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:43,890
Is like...

2003
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:44,850
Easier...

2004
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:45,670
It's like...

2005
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:47,690
What's the word?

2006
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,090
Logistic wise?

2007
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:51,670
Logistic wise, it's like...

2008
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:54,590
Less...

2009
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:55,550
Mentally draining.

2010
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,270
It's just simpler to deal with.

2011
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:02,970
Logistically.

2012
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,020
I don't think you guys...

2013
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,920
I feel like a lot of you guys don't know this...

2014
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,400
But a lot of VTubers...

2015
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,700
Actually have their own...

2016
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:14,160
Or like...

2017
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:17,140
Have their own like...

2018
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:19,140
Like not company company...

2019
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:22,220
But they register their VTubing activities...

2020
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:23,580
As their own business.

2021
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,160
So a lot of them have their own like actual...

2022
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,220
Business business.

2023
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,200
Because like...

2024
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,220
It's just easier to...

2025
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:30,400
Like...

2026
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,040
Um...

2027
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,120
Especially when you're getting paid.

2028
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:33,040
Yeah, LLCs.

2029
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:33,260
Yeah.

2030
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:35,900
A lot of like VTubers have like...

2031
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:36,760
Or entertainers.

2032
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:37,600
Or content creators.

2033
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:39,360
Um...

2034
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:40,880
Use like...

2035
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,520
LLC or like...

2036
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:43,420
Incorporated.

2037
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:44,500
I'm incorporated.

2038
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,280
It's just...

2039
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,530
Easier in terms of like...

2040
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:49,920
Taxes and branding.

2041
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:50,280
Yeah.

2042
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:56,270
Like even like...

2043
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:56,990
Indies too.

2044
01:39:57,470 --> 01:39:58,450
I know like a lot of...

2045
01:39:58,450 --> 01:39:59,570

2046
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:00,530
Corporate VTubers.

2047
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:03,090
A lot of Indies and corporate VTubers...

2048
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:04,990
Are registered under a...

2049
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:06,110
Um...

2050
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:07,130
Under like an...

2051
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:08,850

Like their own com...

2054
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:11,790
Like their own company.

2055
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:12,750
So when they get paid...

2056
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:14,130
It's just easier to...

2057
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:14,920
Have it go through...

2058
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:15,930
The company.

2059
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:17,770
Versus go through themselves.

2060
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:27,180
Yeah.

2061
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:27,760

2062
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:28,760

I just saw...

2069
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:43,440
The funniest title for a stream called...

2070
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,040
Helping Doki not be...

2071
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:45,580
A pain.

2072
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:46,160
Weeb.

2073
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,640

Thank you.

2080
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:52,520
As IT...

2081
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:55,360
Trying to incorporate both American and Canadian addresses...

2082
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,120
Is such a pain.

2083
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:58,060
That usually an entire new system...

2084
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:59,560
Is just made for one or the other.

2085
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:00,620
Thank you for the super chat.

2086
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:00,980

Yeah.

2090
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:03,800
It is.

2091
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,040
It's pretty painful.

2092
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:06,380
Um...

2093
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:07,440
I feel like it's...

2094
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,300
Like coding-wise...

2095
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:09,560
There's a lot to go into it.

2096
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:10,580
Um...

2097
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:10,900
Maddie.

2098
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:11,860
Thank you for the super chat.

2099
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:12,180
Thank you.

2100
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:12,780
Thank you.

2101
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:15,760
How much is a share of Doki Bird Incorporated?

2102
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:16,760
Thank you for the super chat.

2103
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:17,100
Thank you.

2104
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:17,680
Thank you.

2105
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,080
I own all the shares.

2106
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:20,180
So...

2107
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,560
I'll never go public.

2108
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,420
In the current stock market?

2109
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,720
Are you fucking crazy?

2110
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:30,540
Like...

2111
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:30,960
Thank you.

2112
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:34,700
This is the time where you don't go public.

2113
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:35,960
Like...

2114
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:36,960
I saw...

2115
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:37,820
Bro...

2116
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:39,160
In the current economy...

2117
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,080
In the current stock market...

2118
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:44,460
Why the fuck would you ever right now?

2119
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,000
Bro, it's so...

2120
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,860
Bro...

2121
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:54,160
The scariest part is that apparently America's stock...

2122
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:56,960
America's stock market has not opened yet.

2123
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,060
But you can see the rest of the world...

2124
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:01,700
That's so scary.

2125
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,920
That's so scary.

2126
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,800
It's like...

2127
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:11,200
America's slowly watching each country opening their stock market before...

2128
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,160
Before the time zone catches up right now.

2129
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:15,260
Like...

2130
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,100
It's like...

2131
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,140
It's like...

2132
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:19,080
NA...

2133
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,480
NA and EU's just looking at what's going on in Asia and they're like...

2134
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:24,260
And it's like...

2135
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:24,860
Like a...

2136
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:25,780
A fucking...

2137
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:27,420
It's like a pandemic, you know?

2138
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:29,900
And then you can see it's like a zombie apocalypse.

2139
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:33,060
And you see it slowly approaching you.

2140
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,920
It's like...

2141
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,440
It's slowly approaching you right now.

2142
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:40,200
You're like...

2143
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,800
It's almost opening time.

2144
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,680
Oh my god.

2145
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,480
And you can't do anything right now.

2146
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,840
All you can do is watch.

2147
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:51,840
All you...

2148
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:55,780
Um...

2149
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:58,200
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

2150
01:42:58,320 --> 01:42:59,280
Thank you, thank you.

2151
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,140
CEO's can see when.

2152
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:01,920
Thank you for the super chat.

2153
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,840
Thank you, thank you.

Thank you, thank you.

2177
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,060
Let's see...

2178
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,380
I don't remember my address.

2179
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,320
Like, for my business.

2180
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:51,280
Because it's different.

2181
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:57,740
Uh...

2182
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:58,620
Let's see.

2183
01:43:58,740 --> 01:43:59,620
I pinned it somewhere.

2184
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:01,280
I pinned it with my manager's chat.

2185
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:05,000
I just put all the most important information in my chat with my manager.

2186
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:06,580
So I can...

2187
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:07,620
Uh...

2188
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:08,100
I just...

2189
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,080

01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:19,290

Ah, yes.

2198
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:35,110
The VTuber market is where the stock won't crash.

2199
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:42,630
The smartest investment is right here.

2200
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:46,710
Everything is crashing.

2201
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:47,950
But not...

2202
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:49,110
Not this market.

2203
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:53,290
They're too big to fail!

2204
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:55,610
The bubble's not gonna pop, guys!

2205
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:00,110

Thank you, thank you!

2213
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:24,620
Alright.

2214
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:27,820
Let's see...

2215
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:30,900
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

2216
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,080
Oh!

2217
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,700

2218
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,480
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

2219
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:43,840

2220
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,660
So, at least you guys can save up for it.

2221
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,160

2222
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:48,360
It'll be like...

2223
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:49,580
Sometime in the future.

2224
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:52,260
So, it won't be a surprise and be like...

2225
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:53,360

Um...

2229
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,080

2230
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,560
You know, we have a lot of plushies.

2231
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:04,200

2234
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:09,540
We don't...

2235
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,620

That's my city.

Do they not rep... do they not see my city?

Imagine he's gonna be so proud of me that I did this live on stream.

2338
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:30,550
Is he gonna be so proud of me and I didn't leak any details.

2339
01:55:35,070 --> 01:55:36,690
He's gonna be so proud.

2340
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:41,150
Yay!

2341
01:55:47,410 --> 01:55:49,030
Oh, what's my password?

2342
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:54,310
I have like a million tabs open right now.

2343
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:03,920
What

2344
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:09,140
card is this one?

2345
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:11,220
Oh.

2346
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:15,460
Oh.

2347
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:19,780
Which... which one is this one?

2348
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:22,780
I don't know how to look at my bank.

2349
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:24,580
I don't know which account this one is.

2350
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:28,480
Is it this one?

2351
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:36,160
No, it's not.

2352
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:38,300
Okay, it's this one.

2353
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:43,400
Hope this is the right account I'm looking because then it'd be awkward.

2354
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:55,860
Connect to my bank, please.

2355
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:01,380
You're getting verification data.

2356
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:04,400
It's loading.

2357
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:07,720
Where's my tissue?

2358
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:10,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2359
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:12,540
I was gonna use the bathroom.

2360
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:13,340
I'll be right back, guys.

2361
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:14,420
I gotta use the bathroom.

2362
01:58:19,570 --> 01:58:20,450
I'm back.

2363
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:21,710
What the fuck?

2364
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:24,150
It says my credential's not correct.

2365
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:25,830
Okay, no, that can't be right.

2366
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:29,630
I think I need like... Oh, it might be different.

2367
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:31,450
Okay, that'll be awkward.

2368
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:35,390
Alright, I'm gonna add.

2369
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:36,730
Maybe it's this?

2370
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:40,570
Oh, no.

2371
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:45,760
Okay, copy.

2372
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,560

01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:51,180
Continue.

2374
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:59,800
Also, Mehdi, Solid, Zekra, Allen, MorphBoss, Bitesize, Johnny, Mike, Smug, and JL.

2375
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,120
Thank you for the super chat.

2376
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:02,340
Thank you, thank you.

2377
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:09,700
Please, please connect.

2378
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:12,040
Why you no connect?

2379
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:16,540
Oh, no.

2380
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,180
It's not.

2381
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:20,420
Oh, come on.

2382
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:22,240
It's getting verification data.

2383
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:23,820
Come on.

2384
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:24,680
Connect.

2385
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:28,500
Please.

2386
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:30,620
That's all I want.

2387
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,080
Or else I'm gonna get paid.

2388
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:50,620
Did it work?

2389
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:52,720
Oh, it's still working.

2390
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:53,640
Stay with us.

2391
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:53,960
Okay.

2392
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:58,980
They're getting a verification to try to connect to my bank account.

2393
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,960
My corporate bank account.

2394
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:02,760
What?

2395
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:05,280
Huh?

2396
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:11,720
Hey, what the fuck?

2397
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:12,900
Why is it not connecting?

2398
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:17,600
Oh, that's not good.

2399
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:22,600
Why is it not connecting to my bank account?

2400
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:27,340
But I literally logged in.

2401
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:30,400
I logged in.

2402
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:33,160
I'm literally in the account right now.

2403
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,340
I'm in my bank account.

2404
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:40,020
That doesn't make sense.

2405
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:41,880
I'm literally in the account.

2406
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,580
It's okay, I can fix this.

2407
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,500
Yeah, that's the password.

2408
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:55,840
Okay.

2409
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:58,540
Okay, guys, this is...

2410
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:04,680
I'm gonna try this again.

2411
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:10,220
Yeah, that's correct.

2412
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:14,700
Yeah.

2413
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:18,620
I fucking hate this bank.

2414
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:23,100
I hate... I hate this bank!

2415
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:26,580
Actually...

2416
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:30,240
I hate this bank so much.

2417
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:33,940
And I have like a bank teller that like, recognize...

2418
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:38,540
Okay, remember when I told you guys the story about that bank teller that asked me if I was JokieBee?

2419
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:42,900
And then like, I didn't go back to the bank for months.

2420
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:47,420
I didn't go back to that bank for fucking months.

2421
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:52,220
And then I went back because I needed to do a Y transfer and I didn't want to go far.

2422
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:54,860
So I came back and I saw him there.

2423
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:56,260
I saw that guy there.

2424
02:01:56,500 --> 02:02:01,580
So I purposely like, left the line like, in the middle of the line because I counted.

2425
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:05,320
And I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna have to go to that guy again.

2426
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:05,920
And then...

2427
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:14,260
And then I left the line and then I went out, walked around, came back to line up and I still got him.

2428
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:15,160
I still...

2429
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:21,440
And then I... I... Oh my god, it worked.

2430
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:22,640
Oh my god, it worked.

2431
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:25,460
Okay, and then I... And then I like...

2432
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:35,660
Approached the desk and then before I gave him my card, he was like, is this for... Is this for Doki?

2433
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:37,220
Like, Doki Braid?

2434
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:42,020
And then I was like, oh my god, I didn't come back for months.

2435
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:54,000
And now I'm... Now I don't go back.

2436
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:56,020
I'm avoiding the bank again.

2437
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:04,600
I didn't go back.

2438
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:10,960
I didn't go back.

2439
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:15,140
Oh my god.

2440
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,140
That is just crazy.

2441
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:22,420
I... Also, I'm... Sorry, I need to grab the code.

2442
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:24,080
I looked away, so I need the code.

2443
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:29,220
I have a two-factor verification because it has a lot of money in there.

2444
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:35,220
Oh my god.

2445
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:37,720
He has to pretend he doesn't know who I...

2446
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:41,100
He has to pretend he doesn't know who it's for.

2447
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,560
It's not taxes!

2448
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:53,860
I'm trying to like, register an account to get paid for a sponsor.

2449
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:57,120
You're watching me get paid right now.

2450
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:01,960
I'm trying to get paid.

2451
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:11,540
Meemen, thank you for the super chat.

2452
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:12,960
Thank you, thank you.

2453
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:17,000
This is maybe the first time you're watching a YouTuber do their taxes on stream.

2454
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:19,360
Johnny Lacone, thank you for the super chat.

2455
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:20,400
Thank you, thank you.

2456
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:22,460
My host, she hates banks.

2457
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:23,880
Let's go.

2458
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:25,880
Wait, what?

2459
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:35,200
We connected to your financial institution, but couldn't find an eligible checking or savings account for money movement.

2460
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:36,340
However, other...

2461
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:39,060
What do you mean?

2462
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:48,140
Are you fucking this bank so much?

2463
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:49,700
I hate this.

2464
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:51,380
Oh my god, I hate this.

2465
02:04:51,580 --> 02:04:53,080
I hate this bank.

2466
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:53,940
I, I...

2467
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:54,920
Oh my god.

2468
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,240
I actually, I...

2469
02:04:56,240 --> 02:05:00,780
You have no idea how much I fucking hate this bank so much.

2470
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:04,020
Like, it has brought me more pain than...

2471
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:04,600
Oh my god.

2472
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,580
I, I...

2473
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:07,080
Oh my god, why did I...

2474
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:10,600
Oh, why did I use this bank for my business?

2475
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:17,520
This fucking bank.

2476
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:19,000
Oh my god.

2477
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:22,400
Apparently, it's not eligible to receive money.

2478
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:23,220
I do.

2479
02:05:23,320 --> 02:05:24,800
I have a USD...

2480
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:26,300
I have a USD account.

2481
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:32,940
I have a USD account in my business account.

2482
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:35,340
So, I have a USD and a Canadian...

2483
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:41,200
I have a USD and a Canadian account to accept both.

2484
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:42,040
Because I only...

2485
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:47,740
I usually, when I work with companies outside of Canada, I only accept US dollars.

2486
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,120
Because no matter what, even the economy might be crashing soon.

2487
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:54,180
Let's hope not.

2488
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:55,280
Let's hope not.

2489
02:05:55,640 --> 02:06:00,300
But like, no matter what, American money will always be worth more than Canadian money.

2490
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:03,080
So, our money is not doing...

2491
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:04,900
Our currency will never do well.

2492
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:15,660
No matter what happens, I know American money will always be worth more than the Canadian money.

2493
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:17,220
So, that's why...

2494
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:21,260
That's why, like, I have to...

2495
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:31,490
Let's see.

2496
02:06:34,510 --> 02:06:35,470
Oh, you don't understand.

2497
02:06:35,650 --> 02:06:36,990
Our paper money is...

2498
02:06:36,990 --> 02:06:39,070
Unless our new prime minister...

2499
02:06:40,210 --> 02:06:41,710
Like, I don't know.

2500
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:45,550
Okay, the only way I can see it is that our prime minister...

2501
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:46,750
Oh, wait.

2502
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:48,630
Fucking pull is a miracle.

2503
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:49,450
Like, I don't know.

2504
02:06:49,550 --> 02:06:51,710
Cuts off the United States from the body.

2505
02:06:57,790 --> 02:06:58,310
Just...

2506
02:06:58,310 --> 02:06:59,770
Because we're connected.

2507
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:03,650
So, like, if something happens to America, it happens to us.

2508
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:05,310
Like, it doesn't matter.

2509
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:08,910
It's like, you know, okay.

2510
02:07:09,130 --> 02:07:11,410
So, it's like we're like conjoined twins, basically.

2511
02:07:13,790 --> 02:07:14,730
Also, like...

2512
02:07:14,730 --> 02:07:16,470
Sorry, I have to use the code.

2513
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:17,190
That's why I'm AFK.

2514
02:07:18,030 --> 02:07:19,270
We're like conjoined twins.

2515
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:20,570
So, like, you know...

2516
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:23,470
You know how, like, if one conjoined twin...

2517
02:07:23,470 --> 02:07:23,930
Because we're all...

2518
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:24,890
We share organs.

2519
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:26,230
So, if one...

2520
02:07:26,230 --> 02:07:27,070
One of the...

2521
02:07:27,070 --> 02:07:27,990
Because we share organs.

2522
02:07:28,070 --> 02:07:33,270
So, if the other twin dies, like, it fucks over the other person because, you know, you're dead.

2523
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:37,930
But we still share the same bloodstream, the same organs, and stuff like that.

2524
02:07:38,010 --> 02:07:42,210
So, like, if anything happens to America, we get, like, collateral damage.

2525
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:45,810
Just because we're connected.

2526
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:54,690
So, like, whatever happens, it happens.

2527
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:09,020
Alright, getting verification data.

2528
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:10,380
Okay, let's see if this works.

2529
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:15,460
It's not eligible!

2530
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:19,280
I fucking...

2531
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:19,860
I hate...

2532
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:20,180
I...

2533
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:21,800
Oh my God!

2534
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:25,360
I hate my bank.

2535
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:31,550
I hate my bank.

2536
02:08:32,130 --> 02:08:32,630
I hate...

2537
02:08:32,630 --> 02:08:33,610
I have to manually add.

2538
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:36,530
I have to manually add!

2539
02:08:37,990 --> 02:08:39,110
I have to...

2540
02:08:39,110 --> 02:08:40,470
Oh my God.

2541
02:08:41,370 --> 02:08:44,070
I can accept American dollars!

2542
02:08:44,930 --> 02:08:47,670
Okay, I have to manually add my...

2543
02:08:47,670 --> 02:08:49,510
I can't do it automatically, apparently.

2544
02:08:53,110 --> 02:08:53,790
Okay.

2545
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:59,170
Okay, this entire stream will be me figuring out this bill.com shit.

2546
02:08:59,170 --> 02:09:00,050
Let's see...

2547
02:09:05,490 --> 02:09:07,590
JL, thank you for the Akasupa.

2548
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:08,830
Thank you, thank you.

2549
02:09:09,170 --> 02:09:12,690
Everything may be going to hell in handbasket, but at least I have Dogekiddy here.

2550
02:09:12,950 --> 02:09:16,830
To have anxiety attacks, or diabetes attacks from LQ shoes.

2551
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:17,070
Yay!

2552
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:22,030
As long as we have anime girls, everything will be okay, guys.

2553
02:09:22,410 --> 02:09:24,310
Thank you for the Akasupa.

2554
02:09:24,530 --> 02:09:25,650
Thank you, thank you.

2555
02:09:28,310 --> 02:09:28,830
Yippee!

2556
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:32,110
Let's escape our problems together.

2557
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:37,580
Okay.

2558
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:02,560
This is the account name!

2559
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:03,320
It's literally...

2560
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:04,040
Oh my God.

2561
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:06,080
It's my business name!

2562
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:06,860
Oh my...

2563
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:07,220
Okay.

2564
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:09,180
All right, whatever.

2565
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:09,760
Whatever.

2566
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:11,420
Whatever.

2567
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:12,660
That's fine.

2568
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:15,420
Uh...

2569
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:16,120
Business...

2570
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:18,440
Oh my God, my OBS disconnected.

2571
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:19,920
Hello, am I back live?

2572
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:21,940
Am I back live?

2573
02:10:22,020 --> 02:10:22,600
Did it reconnect?

2574
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:24,960
It just says OBS connection.

2575
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:26,000
Uh...

2576
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,080
Okay, thank you.

2577
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:28,440
All right, welcome back.

2578
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:28,820
Okay.

2579
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:29,960
Uh...

2580
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:30,600
Yeah!

2581
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:31,980
Yeah.

2582
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,080
It got cut briefly.

2583
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:39,040
Even my internet was going through it right now.

2584
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:43,300
Okay, I'm not in the stream until I figure this fucking build.com shit.

2585
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:46,460
I will not name my bank.

2586
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:48,940
Because I don't want to...

2587
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:49,720
I don't want...

2588
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:51,940
I don't want them to be mad at me.

2589
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:53,880
Hahahaha!

2590
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:58,620
I fucking hate this bank so much.

2591
02:10:59,000 --> 02:10:59,560
I...

2592
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:03,580
Okay.

2593
02:11:11,370 --> 02:11:12,050
Uh...

2594
02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:14,730
Where is my bank number?

2595
02:11:16,190 --> 02:11:17,490
There it is.

2596
02:11:19,230 --> 02:11:20,550
I don't know why.

2597
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:22,410
I should have picked a different bank.

2598
02:11:22,630 --> 02:11:24,710
We don't have a lot of options, guys.

2599
02:11:25,470 --> 02:11:25,910
Hahahaha!

2600
02:11:28,470 --> 02:11:28,910
Okay,

2601
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:35,540
what is my...

2602
02:11:40,910 --> 02:11:42,090
Is this for a Canadian?

2603
02:11:46,710 --> 02:11:48,690
We don't have a lot of bank...

2604
02:11:48,690 --> 02:11:49,610
Good bank options.

2605
02:11:49,770 --> 02:11:51,890
But apparently the one I chose was the worst one.

2606
02:11:56,430 --> 02:11:57,350
Oh my god!

2607
02:11:57,390 --> 02:11:58,330
I'm forced to...

2608
02:11:58,330 --> 02:12:00,810
Oh my god, I'm forced to be paid in Canadian dollars.

2609
02:12:01,490 --> 02:12:02,790
No, they can't do this to me.

2610
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:03,330
I refu...

2611
02:12:03,330 --> 02:12:03,870
Hahahaha!

2612
02:12:04,690 --> 02:12:06,890
I refuse to accept Canadian money.

2613
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:08,050
Hahahaha!

2614
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:14,950
No, please.

2615
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:17,870
I refuse to accept Canadian money.

2616
02:12:19,050 --> 02:12:19,870
Hahahaha!

2617
02:12:24,050 --> 02:12:25,270
You don't understand.

2618
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:28,070
Nobody wants to accept Canadian money.

2619
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:29,070
Hahahaha!

2620
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:36,280
They can't do this to me.

2621
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:38,400
They can't do this to me.

2622
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:41,540
Don't make me accept this.

2623
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:51,340
Okay.

2624
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:53,300
Does this work?

2625
02:12:58,050 --> 02:12:59,170
I have to verify...

2626
02:12:59,170 --> 02:12:59,750
Okay, guys.

2627
02:12:59,770 --> 02:13:01,210
I have to verify my email now.

2628
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:01,830
Hahahaha!

2629
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:02,440
They're like...

2630
02:13:02,910 --> 02:13:03,490
Please!

2631
02:13:05,070 --> 02:13:05,510
Okay.

2632
02:13:08,590 --> 02:13:10,130
Where does it say...

2633
02:13:10,130 --> 02:13:10,350
Oh.

2634
02:13:15,310 --> 02:13:16,010
Where?

2635
02:13:18,130 --> 02:13:19,870
How's my email not verified?

2636
02:13:21,090 --> 02:13:22,230
Are you fucking...

2637
02:13:22,230 --> 02:13:22,770
No, you cannot.

2638
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:23,330
Okay.

2639
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:25,330
Please try again.

2640
02:13:26,750 --> 02:13:30,350
What the fuck do you mean my email address has not been verified?

2641
02:13:30,750 --> 02:13:32,650
Like, what do you mean?

2642
02:13:32,990 --> 02:13:33,510
Hahahaha!

2643
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:42,080
Oh my god.

2644
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:42,940
There's no way.

2645
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:43,460
There's no...

2646
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:44,280
They didn't even...

2647
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:44,780
Nope, nope.

2648
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:46,120
It's not in my trash.

2649
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:47,620
It's not in my spam.

2650
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:51,800
There's no way.

2651
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:53,160
Like...

2652
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:55,980
What do you mean my email has not been verified?

2653
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:57,640
I don't understand.

2654
02:13:57,980 --> 02:13:59,660
Don't do this to me right now.

2655
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:01,220
I'm gonna fucking freak out.

2656
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:01,560
I'm...

2657
02:14:05,060 --> 02:14:06,960
Don't do this to me.

2658
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:07,400
I'm mad.

2659
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:10,840
Oh, don't do this to me.

2660
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:15,500
There's no verification anywhere!

2661
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:19,640
Just let me get paid!

2662
02:14:24,130 --> 02:14:25,470
Please, I just...

2663
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:26,730
I just want to get paid.

2664
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:29,150
Please.

2665
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:32,770
All right.

2666
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:34,290
I'm checking my junk.

2667
02:14:34,410 --> 02:14:35,710
There's nothing in junk.

2668
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:42,440
Oh my god.

2669
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:43,540
Do I have to put my Canadian money?

2670
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:44,460
I swear to god.

2671
02:14:51,370 --> 02:14:52,050
Oh, fuck.

2672
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:52,310
Okay.

2673
02:14:52,570 --> 02:14:54,950
I'm gonna put my Canadian money bank account.

2674
02:14:55,090 --> 02:14:55,930
See if that works.

2675
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:02,260
Please.

2676
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:03,880
Please, for the love of god.

2677
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:11,920
It's like email address has not been verified.

2678
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:13,360
But like...

2679
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:14,960
They never send me anything!

2680
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:21,280
They never send me a thing to verify my email.

2681
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:25,140
So, what do you want from me?

2682
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:27,760
What do you want from me?

2683
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:33,400
Okay.

2684
02:15:33,740 --> 02:15:34,320
It's okay.

2685
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:35,140
I'm okay, guys.

2686
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:38,960
I'm okay.

2687
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:40,400
Everything is fine.

2688
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:42,340
Everything...

2689
02:15:42,340 --> 02:15:44,900
I feel so healthy.

2690
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:46,260
Mentally.

2691
02:15:46,460 --> 02:15:47,260
I...

2692
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:58,680
Never send me a verification email.

2693
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:01,320
I don't understand.

2694
02:16:02,060 --> 02:16:08,860
How do I verify something if they don't even give me an email to verify it?

2695
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:10,060
How?

2696
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:14,100
I never got a verification email.

2697
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:18,740
Please, make it make sense.

2698
02:16:26,230 --> 02:16:27,650
Oh my god.

2699
02:16:28,870 --> 02:16:30,130
Oh my god.

2700
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:30,610
I'm gonna...

2701
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:33,590
I'm gonna go crazy.

2702
02:16:33,830 --> 02:16:35,690
It won't let me fucking get...

2703
02:16:35,690 --> 02:16:36,790
Oh my god.

2704
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:38,010
I need help.

2705
02:16:38,210 --> 02:16:39,090
Oh my god.

2706
02:16:39,290 --> 02:16:39,850
I need help.

2707
02:16:39,950 --> 02:16:40,430
It's uneven.

2708
02:16:41,050 --> 02:16:43,150
I can't get past this!

2709
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:51,120
They won't let me get past this part.

2710
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:01,840
Please.

2711
02:17:01,980 --> 02:17:03,180
I just want to get paid.

2712
02:17:03,180 --> 02:17:04,580
Please, for the love of god.

2713
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:06,320
Just pay me.

2714
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:08,580
That's all I want.

2715
02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:09,720
Just pay me.

2716
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:11,980
Just pay me.

2717
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:24,280
Okay, so there's two options if I can't get the build.com set up.

2718
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:28,680
They mail me a check, which I feel so safe about.

2719
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:30,900
Or they do PayPal.

2720
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:32,780
The thing is, I do PayPal.

2721
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:34,660
PayPal takes a percentage off of it.

2722
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:36,860
So, of course, I would go with...

2723
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:39,920
I would go with something where I get like the full deposit.

2724
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:42,500
So, I was like...

2725
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:47,240
I do not feel very safe with the check option.

2726
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:49,320
So, I'm not going with that.

2727
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:02,520
Okay.

2728
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:06,200
All right.

2729
02:18:12,490 --> 02:18:13,370
Oh my god.

2730
02:18:13,410 --> 02:18:14,350
I swear to god.

2731
02:18:14,390 --> 02:18:16,190
I'm gonna fucking freak out.

2732
02:18:16,250 --> 02:18:17,450
I swear to god.

2733
02:18:17,570 --> 02:18:17,930
I...

2734
02:18:19,390 --> 02:18:20,010
Okay.

2735
02:18:20,550 --> 02:18:21,750
Company address.

2736
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:23,270
Don't worry.

2737
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:25,410
I got this, guys.

2738
02:18:32,220 --> 02:18:33,980
Okay, I think I figured it out.

2739
02:18:51,790 --> 02:18:52,410
Hello?

2740
02:18:54,830 --> 02:18:56,610
No, you don't do this to me.

2741
02:18:58,290 --> 02:18:59,510
No, you don't.

2742
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:08,080
Okay.

2743
02:19:08,860 --> 02:19:10,120
Okay, we're fine.

2744
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:11,420
Everything is okay.

2745
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:16,000
I might have to ask them to mail me a check.

2746
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:16,420
I...

2747
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:25,260
Oh my god.

2748
02:19:25,300 --> 02:19:25,580
Okay.

2749
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:26,920
Okay.

2750
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:29,360
We sent you an email with verification link.

2751
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:29,840
Okay.

2752
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:31,120
Oh my god.

2753
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:32,220
They sent me an email.

2754
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:34,660
Resend email, please.

2755
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:35,940
You've never sent me an email.

2756
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:38,080
You've never sent me an email.

2757
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:40,140
Send it to me again, please.

2758
02:19:44,660 --> 02:19:45,760
Okay, now I wait.

2759
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:53,940
There's no way it takes that long to send me an email.

2760
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:55,600
There's no way.

2761
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:06,420
Oh my god, how long does this take?

2762
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:07,640
How...

2763
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:09,100
No, it's the right email.

2764
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:12,980
I'm literally logging in to the right email.

2765
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:21,360
I only have one email connected to it that I created to log in to build.com.

2766
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,460
Oh my god.

2767
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:26,900
Confirm.

2768
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:32,480
Confirm my email address right now.

2769
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:37,560
My email has been verified.

2770
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,060
I have successfully verified my email.

2771
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:45,260
Oh my...

2772
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:46,940
Oh my god.

2773
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:48,240
It has been done.

2774
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:56,260
Oh my god.

2775
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,340
Did I do it?

2776
02:20:58,240 --> 02:20:59,240
Oh my god.

2777
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:00,760
I connected my account.

2778
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:03,160
My fucking god.

2779
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:09,640
Please do not pay me in.

2780
02:21:09,740 --> 02:21:12,080
I beg of you, do not pay...

2781
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:13,080
Oh no.

2782
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:16,920
Do not pay me in Canadian, please.

2783
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:19,180
Don't pay me in this.

2784
02:21:19,380 --> 02:21:21,300
My dog shit currency.

2785
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:27,040
Let me...

2786
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:30,700
Let me connect my American account.

2787
02:21:39,430 --> 02:21:39,970
Okay.

2788
02:21:40,510 --> 02:21:44,310
Add your United States dollar bank account to receive payments through what?

2789
02:21:44,390 --> 02:21:46,790
Make sure to only add accounts located...

2790
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:46,990
Okay.

2791
02:21:48,090 --> 02:21:48,470
Okay.

2792
02:21:49,350 --> 02:21:50,350
Okay, there we go.

2793
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:51,030
Okay.

2794
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:52,670
Maybe I'll...

2795
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:52,830
Okay.

2796
02:21:52,990 --> 02:21:55,450
Okay, I'm gonna try and see if I can add my American account.

2797
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:00,570
Please.

2798
02:22:01,110 --> 02:22:01,870
Please.

2799
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:03,650
You know the worst part?

2800
02:22:03,970 --> 02:22:06,030
Is that they're originally paying...

2801
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:08,730
They're originally paying in American.

2802
02:22:09,330 --> 02:22:10,450
So they're gonna have...

2803
02:22:10,450 --> 02:22:11,630
The currency trans...

2804
02:22:11,630 --> 02:22:15,650
There's gonna be a fee in my Canadian bank account.

2805
02:22:16,330 --> 02:22:21,510
Because they have to transfer the American money to Canadian.

2806
02:22:22,290 --> 02:22:25,110
But then the bank takes a fee and...

2807
02:22:25,910 --> 02:22:27,650
Doing the currency trans...

2808
02:22:27,650 --> 02:22:29,250
Like, the currency...

2809
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:31,590
The...

2810
02:22:33,170 --> 02:22:33,850
Transition.

2811
02:22:34,430 --> 02:22:36,110
So I need to...

2812
02:22:36,550 --> 02:22:37,910
I need to make sure...

2813
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:41,090
I need to make sure it goes directly...

2814
02:22:41,090 --> 02:22:41,830
Conversion, sorry.

2815
02:22:42,190 --> 02:22:43,590
Currency transition.

2816
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:46,410
The currency transition.

2817
02:22:46,930 --> 02:22:48,750
I'm sorry, my brain's not working.

2818
02:22:48,850 --> 02:22:50,430
The currency conversion fee.

2819
02:22:51,630 --> 02:22:59,670
So I'm trying to make sure it goes directly to my American account.

2820
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:03,150
So it doesn't go through the exchange.

2821
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:05,590
There's so many hoops.

2822
02:23:10,330 --> 02:23:13,470
When I say I hate my bank, I hate my...

2823
02:23:18,310 --> 02:23:21,350
JR, thank you for the super chat.

2824
02:23:21,470 --> 02:23:22,590
Thank you, thank you.

2825
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:25,030
They put me through so much.

2826
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:27,970
Okay.

2827
02:23:30,150 --> 02:23:30,970
Account number.

2828
02:23:31,310 --> 02:23:31,850
Alright.

2829
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:41,080
Where is the transit number?

2830
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:42,260
There it is.

2831
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:46,320
Okay, this should work.

2832
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:48,160
Text me my code.

2833
02:23:56,990 --> 02:23:57,830
Alright.

2834
02:23:59,630 --> 02:24:01,130
Trust this computer.

2835
02:24:03,350 --> 02:24:04,590
Did it work?

2836
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:05,810
Save.

2837
02:24:06,890 --> 02:24:08,090
Oh my god!

2838
02:24:09,930 --> 02:24:10,910
I did it.

2839
02:24:11,460 --> 02:24:13,570
I fucking... I fucking did it.

2840
02:24:13,810 --> 02:24:14,170
Okay.

2841
02:24:14,530 --> 02:24:15,870
Okay, I have a united...

2842
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:16,890
Okay, I added...

2843
02:24:16,890 --> 02:24:17,910
Okay, I did it.

2844
02:24:18,010 --> 02:24:19,890
But why is it still trying to send me an...

2845
02:24:19,890 --> 02:24:21,470
Oh my god, why is it...

2846
02:24:21,470 --> 02:24:22,550
Stop, don't...

2847
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:25,260
I swear to god, if they send me an...

2848
02:24:26,710 --> 02:24:27,210
Okay.

2849
02:24:27,690 --> 02:24:28,810
Oh my god, I did it.

2850
02:24:28,890 --> 02:24:29,370
I...

2851
02:24:29,370 --> 02:24:31,170
Oh my god, I did it.

2852
02:24:32,050 --> 02:24:32,550
I...

2853
02:24:33,890 --> 02:24:34,390
God.

2854
02:24:35,930 --> 02:24:39,030
Oh my god, I fucking did it.

2855
02:24:39,030 --> 02:24:40,990
Oh, I have...

2856
02:24:41,550 --> 02:24:42,970
Guys, I did...

2857
02:24:42,970 --> 02:24:45,790
Guys, I got my USD account in there.

2858
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:47,070
I don't know if it works though.

2859
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:50,210
I don't... I don't know if it...

2860
02:24:50,210 --> 02:24:50,990
If it's...

2861
02:24:50,990 --> 02:24:53,010
If it's accepted it.

2862
02:24:53,170 --> 02:24:55,230
But like, I've added it.

2863
02:24:55,350 --> 02:24:58,070
Oh my god, I fucking did it.

2864
02:24:58,470 --> 02:25:00,670
Okay, now all I need to do...

2865
02:25:02,090 --> 02:25:04,370
Is accept the invoice.

2866
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:08,920
Okay.

2867
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:11,860
Okay, it created it.

2868
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:17,080
Okay, does it go directly?

2869
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:20,080
Oh, I hope this goes directly to my USD account.

2870
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:28,080
Oh dear lord, I hope it does.

2871
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:31,220
I would be very sad if it doesn't.

2872
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:35,420
I will be very sad if this doesn't.

2873
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:36,380
Okay.

2874
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:38,340
All right.

2875
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:50,960
All right.

2876
02:25:57,970 --> 02:25:58,870
All right.

2877
02:25:59,990 --> 02:26:01,110
I've sent it.

2878
02:26:01,390 --> 02:26:01,770
Okay.

2879
02:26:02,590 --> 02:26:03,410
All right.

2880
02:26:03,650 --> 02:26:05,510
I don't know if this is...

2881
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:06,850
Okay, I...

2882
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:08,650
It could... I fucking... I don't know.

2883
02:26:11,130 --> 02:26:12,410
It's been done.

2884
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:14,330
It's been done.

2885
02:26:14,650 --> 02:26:15,790
Guys, all right.

2886
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:18,210
I think that's been a productive day.

2887
02:26:18,310 --> 02:26:20,290
I did at least two things today.

2888
02:26:22,350 --> 02:26:22,950
I...

2889
02:26:23,550 --> 02:26:25,610
Let's hope I received the money.

2890
02:26:25,870 --> 02:26:26,250
I think I did.

2891
02:26:30,690 --> 02:26:32,450
The build.com was...

2892
02:26:33,030 --> 02:26:34,450
It was a fucking struggle.

2893
02:26:36,030 --> 02:26:39,450
So I hope I received my money.

2894
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:42,290
All right, guys.

2895
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:43,170
I'm gonna call it here.

2896
02:26:43,710 --> 02:26:46,770
I hope you guys had a great time hanging out with me today.

2897
02:26:47,410 --> 02:26:49,510
I always have a great time hanging out with my dragoons.

2898
02:26:49,710 --> 02:26:51,390
I hope you guys enjoyed this guerrilla stream.

2899
02:26:52,610 --> 02:26:53,470
I'm gonna...

2900
02:26:53,470 --> 02:26:54,570
I'm gonna head off now.

2901
02:26:54,570 --> 02:26:57,290
I'm gonna do some Rivals grind off stream.

2902
02:26:59,190 --> 02:27:01,970
And see if we get top 500 today.

2903
02:27:02,370 --> 02:27:04,810
For the Shiny Sparkle Badge.

2904
02:27:06,030 --> 02:27:07,770
And I'll do my schedule too today.

2905
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:08,870
Anyway, guys.

2906
02:27:09,230 --> 02:27:10,250
As always, everybody.

2907
02:27:10,510 --> 02:27:11,490
Stay hydrated.

2908
02:27:11,790 --> 02:27:12,370
Posture check.

2909
02:27:12,570 --> 02:27:14,590
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2910
02:27:14,690 --> 02:27:18,070
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

2911
02:27:18,170 --> 02:27:19,650
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2912
02:27:19,950 --> 02:27:20,790
Bye, guys.

2913
02:27:21,230 --> 02:27:21,710
Bye!
