1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,030
bad i at least say discord wait dokey i'm actually live
you're really a active white dude with like gelled up hair

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:20,890
that sounds british yeah that's me oh yeah we've been to
that okay she looks like lemon from uh bullet train yeah

3
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:28,270
yeah damn you're saying the black dude also you're saying
everybody before i start before i start thank you to post

4
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:45,890
your blind spot for the sponsor um we have because sure for
is missing yes we don't know where he is oh no he is missing

5
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:56,850
right now and we are you don't know where he is he has
disappeared uh he has disappeared from society we have

6
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,030
called him better than the japanese version we have called

7
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,950
Uh, we don't know where he is.

8
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,510
But yeah, check out PUBG blind spot while we figure this
out.

9
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,110
Oh, Japanese is so much better.

10
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,210
I think the Japanese version, she's too quiet.

11
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,250
She lacks huge.

12
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,630
There's no sauce in her voice.

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,530
I need the sauce.

14
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:28,870
But it, but it gives like, it gives like a sense of like of
Clarency and kind of like the like of herself and gives like

15
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,790
a more emotion because she's not a loud person.

16
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,810
so when you okay sorry i'm just like listening so we are
trying to she feels like she's not taking that same emotion

17
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,710
like she's in the japanese i sound like such a weak right
now we are trying to figure out what to do right now and

18
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:53,350
trying to find us up we at one point we were like do we just
grab a random chat member like does anyone in chat have

19
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:00,590
played the game what's your defense you might have a chance
to play with us the linking sounds of the dad makes when he

20
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:11,230
becomes a or we pull a random chat member that's all you
were talking about okay whatever and uh no but also why cry

21
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,350
no in the movie so anytime she opened her mouth i would just
start crying maybe it's because i'm a father now if you

22
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,950
don't have experience we can't play with you she went
through all of those trials and tribulations just to save

23
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:31,770
her parents from touching so we need we can either go one or
two ways because i watched like the first part of the

24
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,410
japanese version i was like wow is she not saucing her voice
like why is she anyway oh my god he went to bed at six in

25
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:48,350
the morning no no i i do get the i do get the cool sort of
artistic angle of her not being a professional actor which

26
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,870
actually gives a lot more yes i just feel it gives a lot
more realism to the role i get it guys i just noticed sure

27
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:02,110
for went to bed at six in the morning i i have no idea i
think he's at yeah he might have been in bed at six or seven

28
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,770
in the morning

29
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:27,610
well reset the clock anyway guys feel free to scan the qr
code you're like a really super good player i just realized

30
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,390
that I didn't know who you were.

31
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,170
Oh, you're really good at video games.

32
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,430
Oh, no, I'm pretty mad.

33
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,890
No, no, no, I'm pretty mad.

34
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,590
All right, all right.

35
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,510
So you're going to have to carry us.

36
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,150
You're going to have to carry all of us.

37
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,430
You're the guy with over 3,000 hours in season.

38
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,350
That is true.

39
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,050
You have like a huge brain compared to me.

40
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,170
Wait.

41
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,570
Okay, but hold up.

42
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,930
You are wearing a jersey in your photo.

43
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,850
Oh, I think that trumps any kind of playtime.

44
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,010
Don't look at that photo.

45
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,150
No, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

46
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,190
I'm not bald, by the way.

47
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,910
I'm not bald.

48
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:07,110

don't know he's gonna be really mentally prepared i'm sure

50
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:28,510
yeah yeah he's definitely gonna be very awake Thatcher, I
played Siege for like 50 hours and I was trying to learn the

51
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,210
game in and out.

52
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,910
I get, and then I go straight into ranked and I'm getting
rolled by gold players.

53
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,810
And you're telling me, you're telling me that you don't have
a bigger brain than me.

54
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,730
You're telling me that.

55
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,690
But I haven't played Siege in a while.

56
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,970
Yeah, but your, your experience doesn't go.

57
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,390
It's like riding a bicycle though.

58
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:44,810
Yeah, true.

59
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,470
It doesn't go.

60
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,410
All transfers, I guess.

61
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,330
Like it's just, you just have the, like I'm expecting you to
carry the shit out of me.

That's me.

75
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,690
It's gonna be one of our first interviews.

76
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,510
Welcome in.

77
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,930
Hello.

78
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,930
Hello, hello.

79
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,230
How are you?

80
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:32,830
How's things?

81
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,310
I see you've been grinding the game.

82
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,850
Well, we almost had a little emergency because SureFour
wasn't awake, so we were like, what do we do?

83
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,230
So we're like, how about we pull a random chat member?

84
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:48,070
We were like, all right, let's pull a random chat member and
like whoever has PUBG Blast Black Spirits, come right in.

85
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,190
And then, but then now he's here.

86
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:50,690
So we're fine.

87
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,830
We're not 4v5ing.

88
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,090
So everything's great.

89
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,430
do you know what that would have been quite fun i must admit
but to be fair phalanx here would have been like let me sub

90
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,270
me and get me out of the cast this year he's been playing
quite well so so you're back to a five let's let's talk

91
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,730
about the team though obviously you guys been having a bit
of practice so how you find in the game obviously is out now

92
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:16,810
um who's your go-to character who's the agent that you kind
of i don't know i think her name is claris right yeah oh yes

93
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,730
yeah yeah so amazing my friends yeah one of my friends was
like she's the easiest character i'm like that's

94
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,850
I must admit, I'm going to hold my hands up.

95
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,570
I like her as well.

96
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,010
I like the motion detection.

97
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,230
I like to be able to kind of throw those sensors out and
watch those players come in.

98
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,170
So I think a critical player.

99
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,050
I think a critical player.

100
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,430
And for Alex, I'll hand over to you, mate, because I know
it's a character you like to play as well.

101
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,090
I mean, you just answered the most important question,
right?

102
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,850
And we seem to be very well aligned in the way we like to
play our characters.

103
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,410
Good thing about Clarice also is you never run out of
bullets.

104
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,570
You just never get it reloaded.

105
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,190
Any other things you're doing about it.

106
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,950
Is this similar to any of the games you've played before?

107
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,650
Any touch-ups, anything's regarding the general structure of
the game?

108
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,950
Because a lot of people keep referring to some other games,
but I still feel like it has its unique take.

109
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:12,130
Well, I think the difference is that it's top-down, so a lot
of stuff, there's a lot of new angles and stuff to look into

110
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,590
and stuff.

111
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,630
And there's the util being matched to each agent, so it
really depends on the certain play styles you want to go

112
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:17,830
for.

113
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,790
Are you more like a lurker?

114
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,150
Or are you more like a campy-type style and stuff like that?

115
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,590
where like all your vision is shared with your entire team
too which adds into the whole like teamwork thing where

116
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:36,050
maybe the lurker sees them and then the people who are on
site can come out and help the lurker as well because they

117
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:43,490
have the same sites as well so that's like the new stuff to
be aware of definitely some really new mechanics as well

118
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,850
yeah final final one for us final one for us before we let
you go because you know you need to get ready right yeah

119
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,810
what game style is this team going to bring and more
importantly who should be watching are you an aggressive

120
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:03,770
team are you going to be campy stuff what are we expecting
though from this team i have honestly i have no idea i like

121
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:11,770
we'll see how it goes we're trying to honestly we're going
to figure out our style live on on like in our first match

122
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:17,850
well don't you look obviously it's been a pleasure coming in
obviously this is day number one first and foremost though

123
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:25,950
best of luck for the team i like that get this creativity uh
on the spot so again best luck i let you guys get ready

124
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,970
we've got a couple other teams that we need to get through
um i'm not even gonna ask you you're expected to win right

125
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:39,490
because this is your crate that's pretty awkward i got
knocked out on my own own tournament i i don't even show up

126
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:48,010
for day two i just look you gotta bring it you gotta bring
it you got five up so yeah that's true we just did win one

127
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:54,030
we just did win one that's all we need to win we're getting
more than one we're getting more one we're here to support

128
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:00,990
you don't believe we'd like the character we believe we
believe much love yeah yeah calling fouls be like oh we

129
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:08,750
gotta eliminate someone on the other team it looks like they
they they messed up there gotta make it up 45 oh what points

130
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:16,790
for jokie bird i believe no we're believers we are believers

135
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,410
what character are you playing we're

136
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:05,060
going to do great guys i believe it all right i picked a
white guy by the way are they like wait but like there's

137
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:13,000
multiple white guys in there which one is it no but i mean
like well you're thinking of white skin oh yeah yes no i'm

138
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,760
talking about the guy that was wearing a white shirt oh
you're thinking about skin i was talking about the guy that

139
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:26,240
was wearing the white shirt no no goldberg has a white
jacket and a white white mask yeah and wilson Whistle has

140
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:34,820
white hair and I'm pretty sure a full-blown cloak trumps you
here and his whole face is white.

141
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,840
Yeah, but his other, the rest of his outfit is black.

142
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,620
Half of his outfit is black if you think about it.

143
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,660
No, but from the... Alright, I'm gonna leave this up to you.

144
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,560
I don't know if I'm the right person to make this call, but
I'm playing Goldberg.

145
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,240
Alright, wait, we have a room already.

146
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
Oh, his special ability is white too.

147
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,480
Which one?

148
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,030
No, I actually have a real issue with this sometimes, Doki,
because sometimes in video games you have thermal scopes and

149
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,390
sometimes the background is white and everybody's black.

150
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,350
And sometimes the background is black and everybody's white.

151
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,310
And you have to be like, what do you get?

152
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,430
And what happens after that?

153
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,350
Thermal scopes you like more.

154
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,230
And it's like, uh, you better answer that question.

155
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,690
I'm making coffee while I wait for him to get in the lobby.

156
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,350
All right.

157
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,030

172
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:02,550
okay who's seen those pro siege players that literally sit
like eight millimeters away from on their screen what the i

173
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:11,010
feel like what the and they got their keyboards curved like
crabs i don't like cs players are also like that too they so

174
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,290
i saw one where like someone just taped a magnifying glass
on the crosshair

175
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:27,650
this bio 4k monitor dog just break up with 1080p what's
wrong you bro yeah but 1080p is like nice you know it's kind

176
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:36,110
of like the the go-to it feels the good the watch and look
at now you're not familiar with the gilded resolution 2k

177
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:44,390
1440p was it was that hashtag ad i couldn't tell i'm sorry
do you have a code for it do you have a you have a code for

178
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:55,310
it no hardware manufacturer will sponsor me so no why what
did you do okay i gotcha when truthfully i know nothing

179
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:03,770
about high level play in video games so you're probably
right no you again you got like 4 000 hours you got you got

180
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:12,810
the dumbest thing you can think possible yeah we do want to
support the game like i know the game really well but i also

181
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:19,410
played it um but here's the thing when you don't play the
game properly way more than anyone when you play the game

182
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:27,790
more like out of anyone and you know how to like manipulate
the mindset of a player then that technically makes you a

183
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:34,270
very smart player compared to the normal average person
because they're so sheepbrained when it comes to playing one

184
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:41,950
game yeah so you you they only know how to play one way and
you innovate it and then you make it really uh different and

185
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:47,850
then they don't know what to do and that shows that you're
smarter it's just I'm very in that's why okay I see it

186
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:56,930
that's why with your 5 000 hours you know how to play the
game I'm just gonna listen am I am I allowed to I'm just

187
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:03,430
right i'm just gonna listen to just gotta listen that's okay
i don't feel like i'm that good at siege because i watched

188
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:09,490
siege like over the long time ago but i i still think all
the neurons are still there i'll be okay i believe i know i

189
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:18,650
upped up heavenly oh yeah jinks he's the greatest but he's
not even siege anymore he's more of a clash of clans guy

190
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:24,790
right clash that's where he's every time and he's not a
siege guy anymore whatever it is is he a rocket league guy

191
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:34,450
now kind of he kind of like reinvents himself a lot and he
goes to like different games and just revitalizes each game

192
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,290
for a couple of months this guy's on rocket league yeah i
was just he was on rocket league early he did this whole

193
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:49,690
thing where he's like oh my god this is like a thumb right
now wait he's a he has no eyebrows and no hair yeah he

194
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,670
shaved up his eyebrows that it would regrow and tune it
because i think he's in his three weeks it's like three to

195
00:16:53,670 --> 00:17:00,730
four months so Oh, wait, that takes like two, that takes
like over two months.

196
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,790
Yeah, what if he's just born different?

197
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,550
No, I, oh yeah, born different.

198
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,790
He's not going to grow his hair back.

199
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,290
You don't know that.

200
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,390
Look at him.

201
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,270
Look at him right now.

202
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,990
Pull up his Twitch.

203
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,190
He told me that's going to grow back.

204
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,770
Does he ever have hair?

205
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,150
I thought he's always bald.

206
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,230
Wasn't he, yeah, he has like very little hair.

207
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,170
But is that choice or just genetic?

208
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:37,970
do you know do you know in the vine days the the guy that
says web is is like he looks like that so he looks like that

209
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:47,110
guy surely right i feel like i feel like i'm not i'm not
like exaggerating right i didn't even check up the games i'm

210
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:56,310
so out of it bro no they're doing interviews right now so
like we still like a ton of no i'm gonna kill man see you in

211
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,970
two hours I'm here to shoot people and talk shit in their
chats afterwards.

212
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,410
Unless they win, which case I won't.

213
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,110
Yeah, what do we do?

214
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,130
What do we do if they win?

215
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,650
I'd just be like, I wasn't even playing.

216
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,130
That's right.

217
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,750
I was checking the rules this year.

218
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,210
If I can trash talk and all chat during.

219
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,590
Wait, so can you?

220
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,450
That's probably okay.

221
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,530
Yeah, that's probably being a little toxic.

222
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,970
It's just a little friendly banter.

223
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,420
I held my own team.

224
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,400
Without crossing the line, Heavenly, you can't say you want
to blow up.

225
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:40,920
somebody's house or something i know okay i want kernel
level access to your pc yeah i don't see nothing into this

226
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:51,020
is i can't technically you can say it just you have to say
in game ask for forgiveness not permission that's what they

227
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,000
say aru hodo naru hodo naru hodo

228
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,020
I can't wait to repeat that phrase from the inside of a jail
cell.

229
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,580
Please.

230
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,040
Why would you be in a jail cell?

231
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,460
I missed my taxes one year.

232
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,480
Because I didn't ask permission to go on to the military
base.

233
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,240
You know what I'm saying?

234
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,640
Why are you going on the military base?

235
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,720
I got bored.

236
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,920
I wanted to fly a plane.

237
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,800
I played enough.

238
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,060
I wanted to see the funny helicopters.

239
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,860
I've played enough GTA I know how to fly a helicopter.

240
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,180
You just go up and then forward.

241
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:26,720
Simple.

242
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,360
And how many helicopters have you crashed gta yeah then you
get against the the flying bike and then you get shot out of

243
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,700
the air by someone with it with a controller aim body you
across the map only time i ever played gta and i was like oh

244
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:49,940
this game is ass and i was like the only time you don't have
experience flying helicopters and i was like nah

245
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:01,480
oh they're ready to start apparently everyone ready to run
the set yeah let's go i think it's like what first to five

246
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:09,020
points right or first to four points or five points i don't
remember four points all right four points is not yeah all

247
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:21,080
right first to four points we play it well we get three
defense points all right i don't feel that i'm level nine

248
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,420
everyone's one and level four and low five and then there's
a there's someone that's level 25.

249
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,500
don't worry about that we combine all our levels together
we're still Oh, that is true.

250
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,140
That is true.

251
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,060
I didn't do that, but you could have done.

252
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,180
Yeah, yeah, but Surefort definitely did that, right?

253
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,280

00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,200
What did I do?

256
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,520
Yeah, you're on your smurf account, right?

257
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,900
That's why you're level one.

258
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:47,780
Oh.

259
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,180
I have like three team death matches.

260
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,760

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,440
Did you?

262
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,040

No, he's speaking backwards.

278
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,120
I was going backwards in time.

279
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,300
Trying to recount everything.

280
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,100
He's casting a spell on you.

281
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,480
Go back in time.

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,580
Why are you seeing this?

287
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,120
I do not believe this.

288
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,220
Doki's chat and the person's name is Tana Kaoki.

289
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:58,980
Kanahoki.

290
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,340
Shouts out to you for recognizing me when I'm a lame chud.

291
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,180
Thank you so much.

292
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,060
I appreciate it.

293
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
I appreciate it a lot.

294
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,100
Wait, is he said Doki's shot or the blind spot shot?

295
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,580
My main broadcast up on Twitch.

296
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,780
They're using my Twitch.

297
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,060
Oh, they can't even hear me.

298
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,020
What's the point of saying that?

299
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,240
What's the point of saying that?

300
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,860
I can't even hear you.

301
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,220
Then they can clip that.

302
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,200
You can clip that and send it over to them.

303
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,440

The shield, the shield try.

Hold on.

Yeah, yeah.

466
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,140
So the shields in this game work like my other shield guy
and other shield things.

467
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,220
So if I have the shield and put it up and you plant, they

That entire round, I just tried the frickin wall bang.

507
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,620
I didn't care about anything else.

508
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,700

00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,500
I have, I have an idea.

513
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,140
So, that whole other house that's over there, I'm just gonna
go through that.

514
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:55,960
Okay?

515
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,340
You're gonna go through the entire house.

516
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,160
I'm going through the entire house.

517
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,200
I'm gonna look at the scenery.

518
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:01,920
That is a long walk.

519
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,920
I'm gonna make my way there.

520
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,920
No, it's the long run.

521
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,980
It's how you...

522
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,760
You make them...

523
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,740
I made that run.

524
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,760
It's a long run.

525
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,180
Oh, you did it?

526
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,140
Oh, I didn't even notice.

527
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,500
It's like he was...

528
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:12,680
Wait.

529
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,200
When we were our first defense, I ran to the opposite side
of the map.

530
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,840
I'm like, guys, this place is so big.

531
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,460
Where is everyone?

532
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,140
Bro, why, bro?

533
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,580
How's exploring?

534
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,640
He wanted to know, he wanted Matt's knowledge, you know?

535
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,220
That doesn't break the barricade in one shot.

536
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,440
Crazy.

537
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,780
Where are we at?

538
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,400
Okay.

539
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,580
On the side of the map.

540
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,500
I'm on my way through the house.

541
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,580
So I do have the guns, the bombs, so.

542
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,820
That's fine.

543
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,140
We all have guns, Doki.

544
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,880
Yeah, but my gun's better.

545
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,060
Hi.

546
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,280
Oh, there's a guy over here.

547
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,920
There's a guy over here.

548
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:54,460
Nice.

549
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,720
Got one.

550
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,360
Good kill team.

551
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,340
Don't worry, I'm still making my flank.

552
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,160
Is that a camera?

553
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,300
Yeah.

554
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,160
Stop telling me you got motion, dog.

555
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,200
I know you got motion.

556
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,360
I got motion.

557
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,560
I want a motion sensor.

558
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,020
Hold on.

559
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,180
My motion sensor sees motion.

560
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,380
Can you kill motion sensors?

561
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
They're one in there.

562
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,380
Oh, shit.

563
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,540
Oh, my God.

564
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:15,780
I'm dead.

565
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,660
Cover me.

566
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,540
Foam wall.

567
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:17,880
Now.

568
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,360
No, shortboard.

569
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,240
Don't around.

570
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah.

571
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,100
You let him kill me.

572
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:25,960
The bomb.

573
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,100
I'm on the other side.

574
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,160
Yeah.

575
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,380
Just walk around, bro.

Yeah.

578
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,520
I may have walled you off on accident.

579
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:33,960
Yeah.

580
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,880
I couldn't go past anywhere.

581
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,360
That guy is out.

582
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,060

00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,360
They're just shooting.

643
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,400
Nothing's even there.

644
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,540
Once again, they're just...

645
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,160
You can't go past because we got them.

646
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,080
Molotov doubt.

647
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,940
Yeah, we got Molotovs.

648
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,020
Yeah, yeah, so I'm waiting.

649
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,480
Full scan that person.

650
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,040
Someone in the corner.

652
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,320

653
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,100
Oh my god, there's more Molotovs.

654
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,880
Oh yeah, I can't shoot.

655
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,220
I can't shoot through that.

656
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,360
There's a fence.

657
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,900
There's a wire there, so you get slowed.

658
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,240
Oh, hard right.

659
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,840
Oh, hard right on the site.

I'm googling the number, so I ignored it.

750
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,500
It doesn't come up with us anything.

751
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,940
I can't believe that happened in your context, man.

752
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,500
What the?

753
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,380

around robin so yeah it's like one round each we freaking

760
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,500

763
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,180

character because doki's character has the tightest pants

764

think they're just, they just look really uncomfortable.

766
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,500
Why would you want to subject your character to that?

767
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,140
What if she's into it?

768
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,120
We're live, so I can't say what I was going to say, but
something with all of us know that.

00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,360
Oh, wait, it is best of three.

770
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,680
Like Ariana Grande won't tell you that her ponytail is
actually really painful if you put your hair in a ponytail

771
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,360

774
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,460
Well, it depends on how tight you do it.

Are you trying to say we're not going to win the next one?

809
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,540
We're going to go to three maps.

810
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,300
No, no, no, we're going to the next team.

811
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,200
Go into the next team instead.

812
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,040
I believe.

813
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,320
Okay, they did pick defense, so we might be a little fucked
now.

814
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,440
No, no, we have an idea.

815
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,160
We have an idea.

816
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,660
We just have to win our ones.

817
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,600
Let's make sure for it.

oh that was whoa that was a wet one and then dry one what
the have you never heard that A wet one.

822
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:34,410
You can tell when someone's hydrated.

Yeah.

824
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:36,410
Wait, which one's hydrated?

825
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:37,690
We have to search sides.

826
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,310
The first one was hydrated.

827
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,030
The second one, not really.

828
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:42,910
Guys, swap sides.

00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:57,030
It's okay.

838
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,010
We got Barry on our team, the level 25.

839
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,490

00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,390
It doesn't even require any effort.

854
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,570
And it's funnier than anything else that does.

855

00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:23,810
Yeah, so you gotta play.

911
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:24,450
Lord, how does it go?

912
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,350
Go, go, play, play, play, play.

00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:26,630
Just play.

914
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:27,310
Just go, play.

915
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:27,730
I'm planting.

916
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,470
We're all planting.

917
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:29,170
He's planting.

918
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:30,630
He's sensitive.

919
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:32,890
Okay.

920
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,610
Hold on, I have an idea.

921
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,190
Anyway, I got another one.

922
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:41,970
Okay, I have my position.

923
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,730
This is my position.

924
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:45,510
This is my position.

925
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,290
This is my home.

926
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:48,570
Okay, okay, okay.

927
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,130
Thou shalt show no fear.

928
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:52,430
And eyes are not alone.

929
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,950
We did it, guys.

930
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:55,970
We did it.

931
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:03,590
I can see my king heavily just slowly meleeing the wall
trying to get in.

932
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:08,890
How the fuck do we get through the heavy reinforcements?

933
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,270
You gotta use the heavyware.

934
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,670
That was plenty of time.

935
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,630
That was at least 300 milliseconds.

936
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,930
Bro, there was like two seconds left.

937
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,090
It was like...

938
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,050
I'm like, dude, you don't understand, bro.

939
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,250
I can play that time.

940
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,930
The spawn across the map strat worked.

941
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,910
They probably started playing the mom head-ass.

942
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,390
See, look at it.

943
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,950

00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:09,670
Man down!

977
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:10,870
Man down!

978
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:12,610
Shoot him!

979
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,590
They got him!

980
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:15,910
They got him!

981
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:16,270
Please!

982
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:17,650
Please!

983
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,210
Do you really want me to avenge you?

984
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:22,050
Oh my god, no!

985
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,670
There's one more.

986
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:22,930
One more.

987
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:23,010
One more.

988
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,270
Sure fork.

989
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:24,710
Sure fork.

990
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:25,350
All right, there you go.

991
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,090
I'm not about to let a crocodile beat me, bro.

992
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,190
I walk on land.

993
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:29,850
You swim.

994
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:30,770
Move.

995
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:31,870
Move.

996
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:39,210
I don't think you wanted me to avenge you because the person
that killed you was a teammate.

997
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:40,630
That's not true.

998
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,970
If I had avenged you, it would have became a 1v1.

999
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,390
I don't think we would want the 1v1, guys.

1000
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,170
I don't think you're...

1001
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,270
Wait, I'm fracking out this round though.

1002
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,070
Oh, shit.

1003
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:58,090
Let's look at your accuracy after.

1004
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,890
Don't worry about that.

1005
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,790
You guys never heard of suppressing fire.

1006
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:12,230
People don't understand accuracy by volume, and it's kind of
credentialing.

1007
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:12,910
I'm going with your wall.

1008
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,130
Sorry, I don't know the math.

1009
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,170
You got calculator for me.

1010
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,770
Hey, does anybody else want the decryptor?

1011
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,450
Yeah, I'll tell you.

1012
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:22,170
I'll tell you.

1013
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,210
Do not give it to them.

1014
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,450
Do not give them.

1015
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,030
I can be trusted with the decryptor, though.

1016
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,750
I might put it on A if we want B.

1017
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,290
I'm just feeling a little saucy, you know?

1018
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:35,470
They're very nice to each other.

1019
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:35,990
It's fine.

1020
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:39,870
Alright, girl squad.

1021
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,230
Let's go.

1022
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,650
I'm going the long way.

1023
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:47,770
Make sure for our thing a little stroll together.

1024
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,210
That's a reinforced wall.

1025
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,910
How do we go through that?

1026
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:51,550
You break it.

1027
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:51,950
I blow it over.

1028
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:52,530
I blow it over.

1029
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,910
You're punching it for like six years, man.

1030
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:55,810
Just throw a grenade.

1031
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:00,890
Oh, and we have to break this wall.

1032
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,550
Enemy gadget destroyed.

1033
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,110
Okay.

1034
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,070
Follow me.

1035
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,050
I know where I'm going.

1036
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,610
I'm getting close so I can scan.

1037
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:11,810
Oh, okay.

1038
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:12,450
I'm on your scan.

1039
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:14,370
Boom.

1040
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,850
And he was spotted right there.

1041
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:16,970
And he spotted.

1042
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:18,810
Oh, wait.

1043
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,130
I'm lining up my grenade.

1044
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,130
Wait, bro, they're not even on A.

1045
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:24,690
Oh, they threw a grenade here.

1046
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:25,010
Goodbye.

1047
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:26,050
Wait, what?

1048
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:29,810
Wait, what?

1049
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:30,570
I can't get there yet.

1050
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:31,490
I'm wall off.

1051
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,570
Wait, how do we get there?

1052
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,410
Don't keep breaking this wall.

1053
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:34,850
Wait, this wall?

1054
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:38,690
No, that's where we just came from.

1055
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:40,710
No, you doofus.

1056
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:43,890
Wait, they're over there.

1057
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:44,790
Where's our bomb at?

1058
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:46,550
You know where...

1059
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:47,530
Got it.

1060
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:48,190
Don't you remember this?

1061
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:49,610
Wait, don't...

1062
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:50,710
We beat you in the back of the head.

1063
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:52,090
Unfortunately, we beat you in the back of the head.

1064
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:53,130
Me?

1065
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,010
Me?

1066
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,370
Oh, you actually meleeed.

1067
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,970
You actually just ran up the freaking bomb button there.

1068
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,110
Wow.

1069
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:03,010
You actually ran up the game.

1070
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:04,350
That's cool.

1071
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:05,970
Bro, that's how it is right here, bro.

1072
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:06,870
I don't play no games.

1073
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:08,150
Your own kind?

1074
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:12,210
You- I'm evil, bro.

1075
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,430
I'm on my nefarious shit right now.

1076
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:16,130
This guy has a shotgun.

1077
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,590
I'm gonna run up and shotgun.

1078
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:19,610
We're defense right now.

1079
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:20,030
Yeah, yeah.

1080
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:21,750
Well, any of them are pretty good.

1081
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:22,850
Oh yeah, he has mines too.

1082
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:26,210
The guy has mines, so you can put mines, like, in places.

1083
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:26,690
What the Sigma?

1084
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:27,390
Yeah.

1085
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,610

1086
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:30,970
Oh.

01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:31,430
Okay.

1088
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:32,770
I got an AK-47.

1089
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:46,530
and a saunoff and uh okay okay i'm gonna put this here and

1092
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:07,710
Razor wires down!

1093
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:08,950
Alright, I'm ready.

1094
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:11,850
Almost, bro.

1095
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,900
He's ready to miss here for now.

1096
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,620
I heard some gunfire, so I'm gonna run towards it
immediately.

1097
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,460
That's very smart.

1098
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,300
This is my territory.

1099
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,620
I got motion!

1100
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,000
You do, twin?

1101
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,740
Let me see how money's spreading.

1102
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:31,780
Whoops.

1103
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,220
Nah, this shit, gallery department.

1104
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,820
Oh, I hear the chime.

1105
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:40,960
Wait, where was that?

1106
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:41,620
Where did that?

1107
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:42,500
Over here.

1108
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,120
I was hoping I catch somebody lacking.

1109
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,820
They're going to run into my mine.

1110
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,420
Oh, that's a grenade.

1111
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,300
Oh, that's a grenade.

1112
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:49,860
They're coming.

1113
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,760
Oh, my detector's over here.

1114
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,760
My detector's detecting.

1115
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:54,860
They're here.

1116
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,180
Why are you making the wall?

1117
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:56,580
I'm barricading.

1118
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:57,160
Wait, don't shoot.

1119
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:57,360
Don't shoot.

1120
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,080
I'm a barricade.

1121
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,420
I'm a barricade.

1122
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:59,560
Enemy down.

1123
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,440
That was a good shot.

1124
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:05,460
Oh.

1125
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:05,780

Wait, my accuracy is insane.

1138
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,960
Two shotgun shells at the end of the game just to make that
number happen, so.

You're welcome.

Look at that, guys.

At least you didn't have the lowest damage in the guys.

We're gonna make it.

1146

bullets right yeah yeah yeah but then you know doesn't gun

01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:51,020

stats are telling me is dokey barely hit anyone and when she

01:03:51,020 --> 01:04:03,960
did shoot she missed all of her that is not true i took the
shot that i literally killed i took the shot that counts the

P89 corners before you get to the site.

Coke Zero Coke Zero like Coke Zero is good Coke Zero is just

1193
01:06:54,870 --> 01:07:02,110

I'd rather have brown water

1194
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:12,390
does it have the same caffeine profile of 45 milligrams like
I mean myself, by the way, but it's every I was all this is

1195
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:13,050

1196
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:13,630
It's 34.

1197
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:18,810
It's 34 right now That's actually a pretty good amount just
a teeny tiny bit.

1198
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:25,870
It's actually a good idea 34 per 12 fluid ounces But yeah,
anyway, thank you again for playing spot for the sponsor.

check out my dokeybird twitch because that's where the main

1201
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:42,150
broadcast is playing right now of Luffy and Ace doing a
handshake?

1202
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,070
Oh, what?

1203
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:49,670
We're talking about how, or I'm talking about Adam Sandler,
is it going to be in one piece?

1204
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,130
Oh, yeah, I saw that tweet.

1205
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,750
I saw, I don't think they can afford Adam Sandler.

1206
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:55,410
Can they?

1207
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:55,910
Just they can.

1208
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,030
There's no way.

1209
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:59,710
I mean, it is Netflix, yeah.

1210
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:08,930
It is Netflix, so most likely, I think they have a contract
with Adam Sandler, too, that he has to be with them for a

1211
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:09,230
while.

1212

radicalizing.

Yeah, I got it right here.

1421
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,270
Like 86 different angles.

1422
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:25,530
Just push in.

1423
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:25,970
Just push in.

1424
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:26,490
I can't.

1425
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:28,670
There's literally, yes, in front of us.

1426
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:30,010
Peek it.

1427
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:31,810
Bro, just hold your breath.

1428
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:32,850
What?

1429
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:34,430
You're going?

1430
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:35,290
How does that miss?

1431
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:35,850
Oh.

1432
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:39,130
Oh my.

1433
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:40,510
I got guys.

1434
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:41,090
Not gonna lie.

1435
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:42,370
Their util game is pretty good.

1436
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:44,950
Their util is a lot better than our util for sure.

1437
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:47,810
They don't have enough bullets to shoot all of us at once.

1438
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,450
Just push.

1439
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:48,930
Right across.

1440
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:54,450
All right.

1441
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:54,890
How about this?

1442
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:56,110
How about I go a shield character?

1443
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:58,410
If I go a shield, do you think we got it?

1444
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:00,730
No, that's a good choice.

1445
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:01,150
Do that.

1446
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:01,370
All right.

1447
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,030
That's what we were.

1448
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:02,890
That's what we were.

1449
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,490
And then the bullet didn't hit him.

1450
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:06,570
Maybe you missed.

1451
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:06,710
Oh yeah.

1452
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,110
I keep forgetting you've been playing the sniper character
this whole time.

1453
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:10,750
Maybe you just missed.

1454
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,530
Oh, we got this, bro.

1455
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:13,230
But how?

1456
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:16,690
The little line was on him.

1457
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:19,090
Okay, Patrick has to ask the Bob.

1458
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:20,350
I swear it's going to work this time.

1459
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,510
I swear it's going to work this time.

1460
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:25,530
Just like last time.

1461
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,050
Yeah, I'm smoking a cigarette and I got a giant hammer, so
don't worry.

1462
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,210
Yeah, just like last time.

1463
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:31,170
So what's going to happen is, right?

1464
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:32,930
So here's where y'all go this way.

1465
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,210
I go this way.

1466
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:34,590
Easy entry.

1467
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:38,330
And when y'all get blown up here, I'll be here to cross and
then, you know what I'm saying?

1468
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:42,690
Or or you can put a miner.

1469
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:43,590
I can't click it.

1470
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:44,230
Okay, whatever.

1471
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:46,630

Yeah, yeah.

1571
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:50,230

01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:18,950
You're not.

1650
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:19,970
Why did this guy push me?

1651
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:23,110
I was going to go on the plane.

1652
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:23,910
You were healing.

1653
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:25,530
You're not allowed to do that.

1654
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:27,190
Streep sniper.

1655
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:30,630
Yo, those dudes are really skilled.

1656
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:33,970
All right, team.

1657
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:34,870
We can win the next one.

1658
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:35,670
So we got this.

1659
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:37,310
Let's all turn on monitors.

1660
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:41,850
Yeah, yeah, now that, yeah, let's all just get ready for
real this time.

1661
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:45,210
We're just fucking around.

1662
01:29:45,410 --> 01:29:46,950
We're just giving them a chance, you know?

1663
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,650
Do we want to select the side or the map?

1664
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:50,690
I don't think, do you want to attack or defense?

1665
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:53,170
Let's attack.

1666
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:53,910
Just attack.

1667
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:55,110
We got this.

1668
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:57,590
Wait, attack or defense, guys.

1669
01:29:58,990 --> 01:29:59,770
All right, we'll do defense.

1670
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:00,250
Do you?

1671
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:01,070
Let's do a defense.

1672
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:02,610
Let's show them the power.

1673
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:03,210
All right, defense.

1674
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:03,810
All right.

1675
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:05,830
That's the hardest part.

1676
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:08,310
All right, guys, guys.

1677
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:09,970
This time we're locked in, right?

1678
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:11,870
Well, not me, but I hope you guys are.

Two?

1682
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:27,090
The one that hit and the one that missed.

1683
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:27,610
That's it.

1684
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:31,710
You have two bullets in an M249 saw?

1685
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:32,430

This gives me a chance to move my Spotify over to my right
source because there we go.

1726
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:56,990
Your right source?

1727

1728
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:01,370

1730
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:06,130
So I couldn't hear y'all because I had my music play.

1731
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:10,150

01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:18,870
To be fair though.

1738
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:21,210
That's how he locks in.

1739
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:22,730
That's how he locks in.

1740
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,430

01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:55,370
Okay.

1825
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:55,630
Oh, nice.

1826
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:56,410
You're trying to go through this door.

1827
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:57,530
No, it's okay.

1828
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:59,390
I'm just, I'm just walking behind you, man.

1829
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:00,510
Hold on.

1830
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:01,450
Where do I go?

1831
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:03,290
I'm also trying to, yeah, there we go.

1832
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:05,410
All right.

1833
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:06,070
I'm leaving.

1834
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:06,810
Boom.

1835
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:09,720
Boom.

1836
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,360
Boom.

1837
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:13,540
Okay.

1838
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:14,560
Motion detector placed.

1839
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:17,470
Fires down.

1840
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:18,550
We got motion.

1841
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:19,650
We got motion.

1842
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:20,410
Don't worry.

1843
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,690
Motion sensor placed.

1844
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:26,790
Oh my God.

1845
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:27,310
They're all here.

1846
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:27,710
Oh my God.

1847
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:27,930
They're coming.

1848
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:30,530
I may have sent ever.

1849
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:32,330
I may have sent up everything in A.

1850
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:34,730
Oh, nice.

1851
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:35,990
See, I told you.

1852
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:36,910
Oh, I told you.

1853
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:38,030
I'm behind you.

1854
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:39,110
We're after.

1855
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,350
My brain is in the corner.

1856
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:42,650
This is hell, dude.

1857
01:37:43,410 --> 01:37:45,410
There's only two left alive!

1858
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:50,410
There's only two left alive!

1859
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:51,150
He crouched!

1860
01:37:51,670 --> 01:37:51,950
Fuck!

1861
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:52,810
Do you have to crouch?

1862
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:55,370
Yeah, I didn't know how to- Okay, I got him!

1863
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:56,090
I got him!

1864
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:58,350
To aim down, you hold control.

1865
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:00,510
You don't have to hold control.

1866
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:01,290
Yes.

1867
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:02,550
Motion detector placed.

1868
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:04,330
Oh, they know I'm here, by the way.

1869
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:04,930
Motion in the kitchen?

1870
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:05,550
In the kitchen?

1871
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:07,450
Yeah, directly ahead of you.

1872
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:08,050
I got him!

1873
01:38:08,530 --> 01:38:08,830
Yeah!

1874
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:10,450
What did I say, bro?

1875
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:11,850
What did I say, bro?

1876
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:12,750
What did I say, bro?

1877
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,750
I was a sacrificial lamb.

1878
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:18,590
Yeah, the motion works.

1879
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:19,290
Do it again, bro.

1880
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:20,130
Yeah, just do it again.

1881
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:20,430
Yes, bro.

1882
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:23,130
I'm a bit lost though in this area, but we could do it
again.

1883
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:23,770
Yeah.

1884
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:26,570
No, I'm, well, I have definitely just not lost at all.

1885
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:30,050
They're probably going to expect that this time and just go
to site.

1886
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:31,250
Oh, that's true.

1887
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:37,990
And if they go to, as long as we have, as long as we're near
site, but not on site, they have to figure out where we are

1888
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:38,370
first.

1889
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:39,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1890
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:41,090
They don't have like a way to see ahead of us, you know?

1891
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,430
We just stay like, you know, like B, right?

1892
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:49,730
We just stay in like this general area down here, and they
go in, we shoot them in the back.

1893
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:54,670
Okay, we're just gonna reinforce a little bit.

1894
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:55,910
Reinforcing?

1895
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:58,650
Yeah, swam it down a little bit.

1896
01:38:58,690 --> 01:38:59,150
Go over there.

1897
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:00,270
I got motion over here.

1898
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:01,770
Got motion over here.

1899
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:06,030
Wait, do I have infinite barricades?

1900
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:07,750
No, we have 14.

1901
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:08,890
The top left, the top left.

1902
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:10,750
Dude, top left.

1903
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:11,510
Yeah, I think it's a cheerful.

1904
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:14,850
Yeah, I just barricade the entire map.

1905
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:16,470
Konichi Wagwan, Mina Slime.

1906
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:17,790
Phone wall now!

1907
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:19,930
Oh, I hear people over there.

1908
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:23,010
You could never say that again.

1909
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:24,950
Watch find us!

1910
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:26,270
What's wrong, Kroski Kudu?

1911
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:27,370
Guys, they're heading to me!

1912
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:29,730
They're heading to me and I'm a bit fucked up here.

1913
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:31,350
Oh, they're over by me too.

1914
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:34,250
They did a flashbang, but I didn't get a flashboard bang.

1915
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:37,230
Oh my god, you farted on me!

1916
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:38,910
Did you bring out a run of me?

1917
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:41,630
Is there a way way out here?

1918
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:42,410
They're bringing down there.

1919
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:43,930
They boosted.

1920
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,390
They boosted.

1921
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:44,930
They boosted.

1922
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:45,350
I don't have walls.

1923
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:45,990
Yeah, mollies.

1924
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:47,150
Mollies.

1925
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:47,910
Yeah, mollies.

1926
01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:51,390
Oh my god, they're coming over.

1927
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:52,090
Don't need help.

1928
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:55,510
Wait, I hit him with giga grenades.

1929
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:56,830
Yo, behind me.

1930
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:57,510
Motion detecting.

Got it.

1932
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:59,830

01:41:55,850 --> 01:41:57,370
They're moving towards side, but they're not on it yet.

1974
01:41:57,470 --> 01:42:00,310
I'm just trying to keep blue grenades on it so we can see
when they come in.

1975
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:02,530
Motion.

See, they tried my plan, but they didn't go deeper.

2003
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:37,870
So I went deeper than their flank on the flank, bro.

2004
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:47,830
what me and gomez saw which is them literally foaming off
their only entrance to their own site the other exit and

2031
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:43,810

We got around.

2070
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:28,950
Bro, I'm telling you, they can't sit still that one minute
wait.

2071

I'm telling you, bro.

2072
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:34,590
Can't predict us.

2073
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:37,890
They never know what's going on.

2074
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:44,430
coming next we don't know what they won't know you were like
they're valerie players i was like oh that means they have

2075
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:51,250
like one thing in their mind they want to get a kill what if
you don't give a super gomez shooting that the whole time

2076
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:59,830
what do you mean a fucking iron wall i'm shooting the your
iron wall yeah don't get mad at me it's not my fault i'm i

2077
01:45:59,830 --> 01:46:11,370
was partnering up with a guy that you're talking to 790
contribution smirks yeah what was your contribution gomez

2078
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:17,770
what the fuck were you doing oh i don't i don't know i i
don't know how to check it again how do i check it oh of

2079
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:25,410
course you didn't i think you can swap sites on defense if
you hit e on the operator select oh can that's true i don't

2080
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:31,750
want to do that did we just learn some tech oh i don't want
to do If any of these guys have practiced taking sites, if

2081
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:34,790
we just switch the site, then they're going to be so
grieved.

2082
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:37,150
They're going to be like, where the fuck am I?

2083
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:45,070
Okay, you're doing it because I have no clue how to do it.

2084
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:51,190
Well, they're probably going to pick defense first, so I'm
going to switch to observe.

2085
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:51,490
Let's see.

2086
01:46:52,450 --> 01:46:53,250
They're thinking.

2087
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:54,410
They're thinking right now.

2088
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:56,290
They're strategizing.

2089
01:46:57,590 --> 01:46:58,710
Oh, it's the hospital.

2090
01:46:59,350 --> 01:47:03,450
Oh, my God.

2091
01:47:03,770 --> 01:47:05,590
Okay, do we want attack or defense?

2092
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:07,350
Attack or D?

2093
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:10,090
I feel like...

2094
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:12,790
I could do like a...

2095
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:13,670
I could do a coin flip.

2096
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:15,110
What were we good at?

2097
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:15,710
I don't even remember.

2098
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:16,630
What were...

2099
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:18,450
Oh, we're already good at defense.

2100
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:19,370
We're good at defense.

2101
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:20,410
All right, I'll go D then.

2102
01:47:20,650 --> 01:47:20,850
Defense.

2103
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:24,430
There we go.

2104
01:47:24,830 --> 01:47:25,990
I spelled defense wrong.

2105
01:47:28,090 --> 01:47:28,510
Defense.

2106
01:47:28,970 --> 01:47:29,910
Ooh, defense!

2107
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:31,210
That's not...

2108
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:31,830
That's correct.

2109
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:32,970
No, I spelled defense right.

2110
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:35,350
Oh, that's not...

2111
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:36,250
No, no, it's right.

2112
01:47:36,430 --> 01:47:36,710
It's right.

2113
01:47:36,770 --> 01:47:38,410
I just wanted to see if you guys noticed.

2114
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:41,510
Oh, that's...

2115
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:41,810
Yeah.

2116
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:43,170
I mean, if you're British, it's different.

2117
01:47:46,510 --> 01:47:47,650
All right, we're so ready.

2118
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:48,330
Oh, just one.

2119
01:47:48,490 --> 01:47:51,530
The British spelled defense different.

2120
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:52,270
Probably.

2121
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:53,290
They spelled with a C.

2122
01:47:53,770 --> 01:47:54,590
Yeah, I spelled with a C.

2123
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:55,510
I thought that was only...

2124
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:58,090
I'm from Canada originally, and yeah, you spelled with a C.

2125
01:47:58,090 --> 01:48:04,890
Commonwealth countries spell it with a yeah I was gonna say
but then ENCE I was just testing who's American and who's

2126
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:17,070
Canadian they spell it American spell with an S and
Canadians aluminum aluminum oh I think aluminum is dumb as

2127
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:28,310
well and if you say yeah I just think it's stupid aluminum
is too much too many syllables aluminum and He's getting

2128
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:30,450
like 10 IQ points by saying aluminium.

2129
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:34,230
What?

2130
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:35,470
I love that video.

2131
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:36,450
What is this?

2132
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,410
A ghoul.

2133
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:38,890
This.

2134
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:40,450
A cadaver.

2135
01:48:42,290 --> 01:48:43,490
A manna.

2136
01:48:43,930 --> 01:48:45,110
A casket.

2137
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:50,690
They disabled switching sites and stuff, I think.

2138
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:51,310
No!

2139
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:54,930
I see the prepared option there, but it's like great.

2140
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:57,410
Oh, I see it, yeah.

because it provides no utility to our team yeah i'm gonna do

2144
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:24,410
that i'm gonna do that

2145
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:28,850
We can cross in here.

2146
01:49:28,850 --> 01:49:28,910
No, no.

2147
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:30,510
Yeah, yeah.

2148
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:32,090
I'm gonna set it up now.

2149
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:33,610
Oh, no, I canceled it.

2150
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:37,510

And then we have this whole area to it, like, just to be
able to, to go in between.

2154
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:46,430
All right.

2155
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:48,610
I might have a barricade.

2156
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:49,650
Where would they go?

2157
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:50,670
Oh, come my way.

2158
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:51,210
Come in my way.

Don't worry.

2163
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:56,190
I'm showing a motion sensor.

2164
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:57,230
I don't know.

2165
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:59,510
This angle is insane.

2166
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:00,590
Look at my angle.

2167
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:01,590
Holy shit.

2168
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:04,450
I can see the whole hallway from this up.

2169
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,390
Oh, oh, they're over there.

2170
01:50:06,630 --> 01:50:06,770

2186
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:18,470

01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:19,690

2193
01:50:28,190 --> 01:50:29,750

01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:35,670
Oh, me.

2199
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:36,530

2206
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:46,890
No, I did the thing where I didn't switch to my weapon
again.

2207
01:50:49,090 --> 01:50:51,310
I pressed left click and it just made it click.

2208
01:50:51,470 --> 01:50:52,630
And then you wouldn't shoot.

2209
01:50:53,010 --> 01:50:53,850
One minute remaining.

2210
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:55,370
Wait, one minute.

2211
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:56,410
Oh, my God.

2212
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:57,390

2241
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:22,180

Nice.

2247
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:26,280

Dirt.

2249
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:27,640
Dirt's planning.

2250
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:28,120
Hold on.

2251
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:29,120

Oh, boom.

2256
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:36,380
Wait, he's safe.

2257
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:38,460
Oh, last one is melee, melee, melee.

2258
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:39,440
Okay, you guys got.

2259
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:40,140
Oh, no.

2260
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:42,160
Do you want it or ask for you?

2261
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:44,220
You want it or I need all charge.

2262
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:45,040
So like, I'll take it.

2263
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,040
The fire.

2264
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:47,180
We're dying.

2265
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:47,760
We're dying.

2266
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,460
Holy shit.

2267
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,240
It's true.

2268
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:53,240
There was a lot in there.

2269
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:53,920
So I can watch out.

2270
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,560
You can't kill me on the portal right now.

2271
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,640
I'm actually invincible.

2272
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:06,200
You cannot kill me in a way that matters.

2273
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:06,860
I am.

2274
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,020
Do you really know what you do?

2275
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:12,620
They have like three stacked on top of each other and I was
just throwing impact nades.

2276
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:16,060
And then Gomez walked into my gas launcher and killed
himself.

2277
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:18,240
Wait, did you kill me?

2278
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:18,800
Yes.

2279
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:19,900
There's friendly fire.

2280
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:20,780
Of course there is.

2281
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:22,640
Oh, wait, no.

2282
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:23,640
I thought I got shot.

2283
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:24,560
That was the gas.

2284
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,140
No, you went into my gas.

2285
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:26,540

2286
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:27,020

although the barricades are shared yeah so basically you

2290
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:00,800

barricade before other people barricade what they want to

2291

You're outskirts.

2434
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,480

Someone got double shotgun in the face.

2442
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:26,380

02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:27,380

Yeah, that's true.

2451
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:43,020
Who gave me back the bomb?

I have the bomb.

2461
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:54,340
Why can I jump through this?

2462
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:56,620
Oh, dokey, you are the bomb.

2463
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:57,560
Damn.

2464
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,360
That was oddly wholesome.

2465
02:01:59,820 --> 02:01:59,920
Mine.

2466
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:04,160
No, does the blue grenade on the black guy with the weird
haircut, does that do damage?

2467
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:08,040
Yes, that's like it's like there's no we denial.

2468
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:10,360

Okay, you shot.

2472
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:19,780
Oh, corner camping.

2473

He's right there through the I fucked up my motion.

2474
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:26,400
If this guy peeks me, he's dead.

2475
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:28,200
They are so dead.

2476
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:29,720
Can you destroy motion sensors?

2477
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:30,500
Yeah, you can melee.

2478
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,500
You shoot it or yeah, you shoot it.

2479
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,100
And you can shoot it.

2480
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:33,880
You have to melee it.

2481
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,900
Do you have to crouch shoot it or how?

2482
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:39,680
Uh, I think someone's got a shotgun in there.

2483
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:40,780
You have to shoot at the ground.

2484
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:42,820
Oh, you see that motion sensor?

2485
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:43,560
I was right.

2486
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:45,440

Yep.

You're looking, I'm so sorry for your motion sensor.

2489
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:54,240
What did you do to my motion sensor?

2490
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:56,320
Blowing that hole up.

2491
02:03:01,610 --> 02:03:02,210
You should basically.

2492
02:03:02,430 --> 02:03:03,610
Motion sensor deployed.

2493
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:05,970

I'm trying to keep the morale up, man.

2517
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:58,020
Why are you keeping your morale up and you bring up the fact
that we're losing?

2518
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,580
They freaking kicked us on the ground.

2519
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:03,700
You're putting dirt in our face, man.

2520

You were supposed to carry, Gomez.

2521
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:08,720
What's the point of being level nine?

2522
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:13,780
I can't say anything.

2523
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:14,560

2529
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:51,800
No, I was like, I, I did that for like two weeks.

2530
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:53,620
You truly want our forgiveness.

2531
02:06:54,180 --> 02:06:54,960
That's what you must do.

2532
02:06:55,120 --> 02:06:57,480
Yeah, that must, you must do that.

2533
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:03,380
Oh, actually, you know what?

2534
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:07,840
Sure, for us, since you haven't played the game at all, I
was playing on Rocket for like two weeks straight, and I got

2535
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:10,960
to the point where I started like VPS rocketing, and I, and
I was like climbing.

2536
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:12,900
I started climbing again.

2537
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:13,980
It was pretty, it was pretty fun.

2538
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:16,240
Why were you playing Rocket for two weeks straight?

2539
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:24,520
yeah i wish you did yourself because it's either it's either
triple support and i have to go with third support or or i

2540
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:29,980
have three deep or four dps players on my team and i have to
get i have to play support it sucks see what i do and just

2541
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:38,600
like play flank adam and then watch everything unfold around
you the lot what's your win rate on that you know he can fly

2542
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:43,540
now i had like a 75 win rate on it and people were crashing
out

2543
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:49,140
You can do that now because he can fly now.

2544
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:50,220
Yeah, he can fly.

2545
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:51,360
You can flank.

2546
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:51,560
It's right.

2547
02:07:51,620 --> 02:07:52,820
You're not playing it for that.

2548
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,540
He doesn't want to go through triple support.

2549
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,440
He doesn't want fucking go against triple support.

2550
02:07:59,240 --> 02:07:59,900
No, no, no, no, no.

2551
02:08:00,020 --> 02:08:00,820
But he doesn't understand.

2552
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:05,900
If he picks Adam, they're going to think he's running triple
support, but then he's actually on the flank.

2553
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,720
So he's just another DPS.

2554
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:12,700
What's going to happen is I'm going to pick Adam, then we're
going to have one other support and then they go, what the

2555
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:13,240
hell dude?

2556
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,560
Are Adam is flanking?

2557
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:15,360
Bro.

2558
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:15,880
Bro.

2559
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:24,540
no no no you trust me just if there's a if there's a game
with two supports already just pick out them you you like

2560
02:08:24,540 --> 02:08:31,780
bait them so hard think about it you can you can mind-boggle
them if you just if you just play into their mind into their

2561
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:45,060
mindset i don't think so waves my finger no no he doesn't
want to do that i'd rather play dead walk we're playing

2562
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:53,140
deadlock i feel like you played the the guy with the pillow
rem i play him sometimes no he does like he does what he

2563
02:08:53,140 --> 02:09:02,640
plays he plays like all the new characters right who's the
best out of all the new characters uh silver probably i

2564
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:09,300
thought she had like a shitty ass win rate on launch no
there's no way there's no way you're not playing ram i

2565
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:14,520
should say you character but that is a new character Celeste
is not stronger than Silver.

2566
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:15,540
That's Cap.

2567
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,500
Who said that?

2568
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:19,800
My chat.

2569
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:21,880
You're streaming.

2570
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:22,940
I don't even know that.

2571
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:24,320
What do you mean?

2572
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:29,360
Dude, I'm just so used to having a movie in Russian, just
not streaming.

2573
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:32,320
So I thought, I was like, oh, you know, those two, those two
are not streaming.

2574
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:33,400
Surefire is not going to stream.

2575
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:34,220
Oh, he's streaming.

2576
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:35,980
I didn't know that.

2577
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:37,540
Yeah.

2578
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:40,680
I mean, streaming versus not streaming is really just a
choice between whether you want to be live on the internet

2579
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:40,920
or not.

2580
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:42,900
I mean, what do you?

2581
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:44,020
Yeah.

2582
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:47,720
It's an old choice at the end of the day.

2583
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:54,580
So Super Gomez, do you play a lot of...

2584
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:56,240

2585
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:57,880
I play a lot of Overwatch.

2586
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:01,080
I used to play a lot of Overwatch, and then I played a lot
of rivals.

2587
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:01,600
Overwatch?

2588
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:02,140
Yeah.

2589
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:07,260
You know, me and Shorfour used to be together when we were
on Sentinels, but now it's just him, right?

2590
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,660
Since he's the only one signed in it.

2591
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:11,560
No, they picked up a new team.

2592
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:19,920
used to yeah they did pick up a new team yeah but me and him
like we're skipping together holding hands and shit and you

2593
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:29,480

that that decision ever oh he was saying how you and you and

2597

2598
02:10:57,020 --> 02:11:05,540
little too excited there no i was impressed to myself i was
like if i mess this up all my all my recognition for him is

2599
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:13,820
gone cool i was gonna get booted to the to the ground like
all of his other duos where he just leaves them in the dirt.

2600
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:14,600
Hmm?

2601
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:15,300
I don't do.

2602
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:17,140
I know.

2603
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:19,800
You denied me.

2604
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:20,480
What do you mean by all my other duos?

2605
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:21,840
It's just me.

2606
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:22,720
Oh.

2607
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:26,040
Maybe not feel special, man.

2608
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:27,200
Because you're not.

2609
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:29,600
Fuck you.

2610
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:30,460
Why do you say that?

2611
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:34,200
Why do you say that?

2612
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:36,180
What do you mean?

2613
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:38,640
I can't handle this music anymore.

2614
02:11:38,860 --> 02:11:39,420
It's looping.

2615
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:41,300
Oh, that's a PUBG.

2616
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:43,480
I cut it off as soon as I booted up the game.

2617
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:56,020
So Gomez and SureForbes play video games for money.

2618
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:56,900
That's crazy.

2619
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:59,200
Don't you technically play for money, Badger?

2620
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:00,940
Making you good videos are for money.

2621
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:02,640
You're good at video games for money.

2622
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:06,580
Not like you play them or you fool around and talk about
them for money.

2623
02:12:06,820 --> 02:12:07,220
It's different.

2624
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:11,200
Technically, technically Russian Badger, I'm unemployed at
the moment.

2625
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:12,980
We got a new...

2626
02:12:12,980 --> 02:12:14,720
Well, we're all unemployed, so that's not saying much.

2627
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:15,400
Yes, okay.

2628
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:16,000
What's up?

2629
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:16,800
New code, by the way.

2630
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:17,420
New code.

2631
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:18,240
What?

2632
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:22,220
I have a bad wrist, so I'm waiting to get that fixed.

2633
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:24,360
Yes, I'm playing with a bad wrist right now.

2634
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:28,020
It's not fun, but it's also not that bad.

2635
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:28,980
Surprisingly.

2636
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:32,780
Not too bad, not too shabby.

2637
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,300
You guys are all super young, too.

2638
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:37,080
You guys are real zoomers.

2639
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:39,300
You got like two at the beginning of the year that you were
born.

2640
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:41,180

02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:15,860
Once it hits 20, I'm giving up and dying at all.

2646
02:13:16,120 --> 02:13:16,940
Why you calling it a day?

2647
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:18,900

2672
02:15:42,150 --> 02:15:43,570
They just not told us.

2673
02:15:43,770 --> 02:15:44,570
Is it Lily Peach's team?

2674
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:45,130
I dropped my grenade.

2675
02:15:45,330 --> 02:15:46,130
Can I pick that back up?

2676
02:15:46,630 --> 02:15:47,230
Oh, I can't.

2677
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:48,730
Once I drop it, it's drop.

2678
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:50,630
It's over.

2679
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:52,070
When I drop up a live grenade.

2680
02:15:52,470 --> 02:15:53,210
Dude, is this live?

2681
02:15:53,230 --> 02:15:53,690
Not my grenade.

2682
02:15:53,870 --> 02:15:54,870
I'm at my C4 charge.

2683
02:15:56,030 --> 02:15:58,350
I dropped my C4 is what I'm going to say.

2684
02:16:00,650 --> 02:16:03,350
Me when I set forth a chemical reaction that cannot be
stopped.

2685
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:04,370
Dude, how do I stop this?

2686
02:16:04,810 --> 02:16:07,070
Dude, how do I turn off the bomb when it's bombing?

2687
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:09,110
Guys, the pins up.

2688
02:16:09,250 --> 02:16:11,470
Can someone insert their finger?

2689
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:13,770
Okay, I'm here in Stuff West.

2690
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:14,650
I'm here in Stuff West.

2691
02:16:15,030 --> 02:16:16,250
I'm East, though.

2692
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:17,590
Foam wall now.

2693
02:16:18,890 --> 02:16:19,190
Wait.

2694
02:16:20,330 --> 02:16:20,550
Motion?

2695
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:23,870
They broke up from the wall over here.

2696
02:16:24,850 --> 02:16:25,550
I don't know how to ping.

2697
02:16:27,010 --> 02:16:28,350
It's Z or X.

2698
02:16:28,510 --> 02:16:29,150
Oh my god, I'm dead.

2699
02:16:30,610 --> 02:16:32,710
Wait, I'm throwing motion for you.

2700
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:34,030
Fulting.

2701
02:16:35,090 --> 02:16:38,030
Okay, you were blocking me, so I couldn't throw the motion.

2702
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:40,110
Oh, I can't.

2703
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:40,830
I'm no motion.

2704
02:16:41,070 --> 02:16:41,790
I'm reloading.

2705
02:16:42,830 --> 02:16:43,250
There's one over.

2706
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:43,950
Oh, my God.

2707
02:16:44,170 --> 02:16:45,410
There's one here.

2708
02:16:46,170 --> 02:16:47,590
There's one over here.

2709
02:16:48,410 --> 02:16:52,350
Oh, they're on, they're on site, they're on A.

2710
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:53,570
They're over here.

2711
02:16:54,170 --> 02:16:55,230
They're on point situation.

2712
02:16:55,570 --> 02:16:56,310
Is it 2v3.

2713
02:17:00,490 --> 02:17:03,130
Oh, my God, they were all here with the H1.

2714
02:17:04,530 --> 02:17:05,350
Oh, they are.

2715
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:07,170
No, no, there was another person that was holding that
angle.

2716
02:17:07,170 --> 02:17:14,290
there was another person that was holding an angle that was
right now you were so fucking uh vulnerable there i thought

Oh my god.

2722
02:17:34,550 --> 02:17:36,930
Yeah, I was gonna say I'm pretty sure he saw you.

2723
02:17:37,990 --> 02:17:40,430
I hit control instead of C because I'm old.

2724
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:41,990
So I didn't crouch under the desk.

2725
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:42,850
I aimed down.

2726
02:17:43,070 --> 02:17:43,710
Yeah, yeah.

2727
02:17:43,730 --> 02:17:44,590
I rebinded all that.

2728
02:17:44,750 --> 02:17:45,750
I rebinded my desk control.

2729
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:46,730
I actually had an old man moment.

2730
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:47,070
I might.

2731
02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:48,410
Yeah, I'm rebinding right now.

2732
02:17:48,490 --> 02:17:49,470
That actually got me killed.

2733
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:52,030
I'm surprised he didn't.

2734
02:17:52,030 --> 02:17:53,070
That actually pushed me off.

2735
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:54,530
Oh my god, bro.

2736
02:17:55,170 --> 02:17:57,170
C is like how you crouch your aim.

2737
02:17:57,250 --> 02:17:57,430
Yes.

2738
02:17:58,110 --> 02:17:58,310
Yeah.

2739
02:17:58,310 --> 02:18:01,090

The fuse right here.

2796
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:17,820
Oh, they had an angle.

2797
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:19,060
Oh, I could see this is his head.

2798
02:22:20,580 --> 02:22:21,840
Well, why don't there's one shot?

2799
02:22:23,460 --> 02:22:24,180

What do we want to show?

2802
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:27,080
You know I'm here.

2803
02:22:27,180 --> 02:22:27,620
They know I'm here.

2804
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:32,120
I got one.

2805
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:33,260
That was the one shot.

2806
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:33,700
I got two.

2807
02:22:33,940 --> 02:22:34,220
Oh my God.

2808
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:34,780
Go my double.

2809
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:36,400
One left.

2810
02:22:36,700 --> 02:22:37,100
Uno mass.

2811
02:22:37,420 --> 02:22:37,760
Uno mass.

2812
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:43,680
I was bait.

2813
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:50,560
Okay.

2814
02:22:50,840 --> 02:22:51,520
We're attacked now.

2815
02:22:51,640 --> 02:22:52,000
We're attacked.

2816
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:57,000
I think we got this, guys.

2817
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:00,420
We can do it.

2818
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:07,120
I thought it was like line of sight where you have to get
hit by it, but I think it has to be on top of you.

2819
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:08,860
It has to be on top of you.

2820
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:10,560
Oh, I see.

2821
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:11,100
Like an alien.

2822
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:15,080
And then their whole, getting flash by it is really bad
though, because your whole screen is black.

2823
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:17,000
It gives you like two inches of a sight.

2824
02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:18,140
Wow.

2825
02:23:18,980 --> 02:23:20,520
I have a little secret.

2826
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:24,100
You can see, for some reason, you can see their bullets,
like from their gun.

2827
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,100
Like the, the, the, the flash muzzle from the gun.

2828
02:23:27,160 --> 02:23:28,700
So I just, I just look at whatever is shot.

2829
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:29,560
The tracers?

2830
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:32,120
Like the, you know, the, you know, like the muzzle flash.

2831
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:33,240
Like the muzzle flash.

2832
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:34,420
Oh, okay.

2833
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:34,600
Okay.

2834
02:23:35,060 --> 02:23:36,660
For some reason you can see it.

2835
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:38,880
I don't think it's intentional, but it's, you can see it.

2836
02:23:40,740 --> 02:23:49,560
that's cool all right what's the plan what what's on here
the plan is when you're one if we're on the main screen and

2837
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:55,960
i get like killed the announcers have to call me headass oh
my god you see that guy that was there what the one front

02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:37,260
You didn't see it.

2896
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:38,900

This is our very first one.

2950
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:55,860
This sniper lady works half the time and doesn't work the
other half.

2951
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:57,180
Maybe you're missing.

I don't, I don't need the bomb.

2953
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:02,660

Yes, you're not.

Okay, do you want map?

We have the reassurance.

3012
02:31:11,580 --> 02:31:12,820
They think that we're tilted.

3013
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:13,760
No, we're not.

3014

Yeah, who said we were tilted?

3016
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:19,840

02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:20,620
We're not, though.

3018
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:21,300
That's the thing.

3019
02:31:21,480 --> 02:31:21,800
That's true.

3020
02:31:21,800 --> 02:31:22,420

No, I won't.

3059
02:34:21,970 --> 02:34:25,170
I don't think you should... I don't think you should hold
the bomb then.

3060
02:34:25,510 --> 02:34:27,210
Oh, Schirfer's not coming with us.

3062
02:34:30,730 --> 02:34:32,090
That guy's a loner.

3063
02:34:32,190 --> 02:34:32,490
It's okay.

3064
02:34:33,530 --> 02:34:34,870
We're a team, guys.

3065
02:34:35,010 --> 02:34:35,670
What happened?

3066
02:34:36,770 --> 02:34:37,930
I thought we were a team.

3067
02:34:38,250 --> 02:34:39,790
Yo, I don't want to hear that shit, Doki.

3068
02:34:39,930 --> 02:34:41,750
You literally just said I got my one.

You guys suck.

02:34:42,910 --> 02:34:43,630

3071
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:44,850
I didn't say the last part.

3072
02:34:44,930 --> 02:34:45,910
That's an assumption.

3073
02:34:46,530 --> 02:34:47,730
I said I got my one.

3074
02:34:47,870 --> 02:34:49,830
I was very happy that I got my one.

3075
02:34:49,970 --> 02:34:51,670
It was up to you guys to get your other ones.

3076
02:34:52,730 --> 02:34:54,410
What is our strategies?

3077
02:34:55,170 --> 02:34:56,710

3083
02:35:59,610 --> 02:36:00,010

3084
02:36:00,530 --> 02:36:01,610
Yo, my fault gang.

3085
02:36:02,570 --> 02:36:03,470
My fault gang.

3086
02:36:04,030 --> 02:36:04,690
Oh my god.

3087
02:36:05,050 --> 02:36:05,670
That guy's got a shotgun.

3088
02:36:05,970 --> 02:36:06,830
And then there was one.

3089
02:36:07,010 --> 02:36:07,850
He's got a shotgun.

3090
02:36:08,050 --> 02:36:08,610
That's a real deluge.

3091
02:36:08,610 --> 02:36:09,670
Who's a range though?

3092
02:36:09,990 --> 02:36:11,330
I can't wait to try that shotgun.

3093
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:12,050
Oh my god.

3094
02:36:12,870 --> 02:36:13,130
I did.

3095
02:36:13,550 --> 02:36:15,110
If you can see a shotgun, it should kill you.

3096
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:16,330
I can't wait to try it out.

3097
02:36:16,450 --> 02:36:17,370
I want to try it out so bad.

3098
02:36:17,670 --> 02:36:19,650
How am I supposed to get through here?

3099
02:36:20,010 --> 02:36:21,370
You shoot the...

3100
02:36:21,370 --> 02:36:23,010
You can just melee the foam.

3101
02:36:23,230 --> 02:36:24,070
You have a scan.

3102
02:36:24,090 --> 02:36:24,390
Shoot it.

3103
02:36:24,590 --> 02:36:25,110
Melee it.

3104
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:26,950
You can go outside and go get the go.

3105
02:36:27,290 --> 02:36:35,090
like so many choices wouldn't be funny if you guys shot from
behind though they're pretty funny nah you guys aren't nerdy

3106
02:36:35,090 --> 02:36:39,650
enough that would never help that paint looks like weight
paint and blender it does look like it's been pissing me off

3107
02:36:39,650 --> 02:36:51,850
a little bit damn did they have one crouch or one standing
up oh my god that was supposed to do that that was true also

3108
02:36:51,850 --> 02:36:58,490

our communication around revo heard you i felt like i

That's unfair.

3116
02:37:33,630 --> 02:37:34,230
That's cheating.

3117
02:37:34,550 --> 02:37:35,390
He didn't have cover.

3118
02:37:36,610 --> 02:37:37,690
He didn't have cover.

3119
02:37:37,910 --> 02:37:38,270
You did.

3120
02:37:38,390 --> 02:37:38,830
You're cheating.

Win the one.

3122
02:37:40,490 --> 02:37:41,570

Oh, shoot behind me.

3176
02:40:41,210 --> 02:40:42,010
Right here.

3177
02:40:42,150 --> 02:40:42,350
Flanking right here.

3178
02:40:42,470 --> 02:40:45,950
Flanking right here.

3179
02:40:45,950 --> 02:40:46,110
Oh, you there.

3180
02:40:46,110 --> 02:40:46,450
Where's the bomb?

3181
02:40:46,970 --> 02:40:48,190
This was short for it.

3182
02:40:48,490 --> 02:40:48,770
What the fuck?

3183
02:40:48,830 --> 02:40:50,490
He's short for fighting his life right now.

3184
02:40:50,490 --> 02:40:50,990
Oh, he's right there.

3185
02:40:51,430 --> 02:40:52,090
Okay, nice.

3186
02:40:52,250 --> 02:40:52,590
Okay, sorry.

3187
02:40:52,790 --> 02:40:52,930
Sorry.

3188
02:40:53,050 --> 02:40:53,510
What are you saying?

3189
02:40:53,730 --> 02:40:54,050
Well done.

3190
02:40:54,050 --> 02:40:56,650
No, I was just watching you because I was like, how are you
gonna kill me?

3191
02:40:56,650 --> 02:40:58,910
I don't think the sniper is 100% accurate.

3192
02:40:59,350 --> 02:40:59,990
It's not.

3193
02:41:01,130 --> 02:41:01,530
What?

3194
02:41:02,350 --> 02:41:03,150
Yes, it's a shotgun.

3195
02:41:03,430 --> 02:41:04,210
Wait, did you think it was?

3196
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:06,950
It's a sniper that isn't 100% accurate.

3197
02:41:07,130 --> 02:41:08,850
No wonder I've been missing it.

3198
02:41:09,770 --> 02:41:11,110
Wait, you didn't even notice that?

3199
02:41:11,450 --> 02:41:14,250
Yeah, I noticed because I've been missing.

3200
02:41:14,990 --> 02:41:17,450
It's because we've been gaslighting.

3201
02:41:17,630 --> 02:41:19,930
Maybe we didn't hit your shots, bro, maybe.

3202
02:41:20,730 --> 02:41:22,630
You're not, I promise you're not asked.

3203
02:41:22,870 --> 02:41:24,030
The sniper is just not 100.

3204
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:27,090
That's fucked!

3205
02:41:27,530 --> 02:41:30,090
It's a one shot and then I have to bolt it.

3206
02:41:30,190 --> 02:41:30,650
What do you mean?

3207
02:41:30,790 --> 02:41:34,650
It's just fucking random R&D that it just fucking not hit
him.

3208
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:36,010
Shoot Doki again.

3209
02:41:36,350 --> 02:41:36,970
It hits her.

3210
02:41:37,070 --> 02:41:38,890
Yeah, it barely hits me though.

3211
02:41:40,990 --> 02:41:43,150
It's only accurate when you're friendly fire.

3212
02:41:43,510 --> 02:41:44,790
Wait, did you say R&D or R&G?

3213
02:41:44,850 --> 02:41:46,490
R&G is research and development.

3214
02:41:47,270 --> 02:41:49,210
I thought you said RTE Doki.

3215
02:41:50,170 --> 02:41:50,310
Yeah.

3216
02:41:51,130 --> 02:41:52,210
How do I put this ball?

3217
02:41:52,310 --> 02:41:53,990
Kind of like, I can rotate it.

3218
02:41:55,410 --> 02:41:56,890
Can you see me spinning it?

3219
02:41:56,890 --> 02:41:57,290
All right, all right.

3220
02:41:57,310 --> 02:41:58,010
Here we go.

3221
02:41:58,770 --> 02:41:59,410
Oh, I was gonna.

3222
02:41:59,770 --> 02:42:00,430
One in a minute.

3223
02:42:00,430 --> 02:42:00,930
One in a minute.

3224
02:42:01,210 --> 02:42:01,630
Mindset.

3225
02:42:02,030 --> 02:42:02,450
Don't worry.

3226
02:42:02,590 --> 02:42:04,330
I got motioning is...

3227
02:42:04,330 --> 02:42:05,910
You guys are barricading shit.

3228
02:42:06,070 --> 02:42:07,190
We still got seven barricades.

3229
02:42:07,990 --> 02:42:09,150
I never barricaded one.

3230
02:42:09,450 --> 02:42:09,890
I barricaded one.

3231
02:42:09,890 --> 02:42:10,370
I barricaded one.

3232
02:42:10,690 --> 02:42:11,190
Coming in east.

3233
02:42:11,450 --> 02:42:11,970
Where's east?

3234
02:42:12,690 --> 02:42:13,290
Coming in east.

3235
02:42:13,590 --> 02:42:14,810
A lot of this is not reinforced.

3236
02:42:15,290 --> 02:42:16,210
There's people over here.

3237
02:42:16,310 --> 02:42:16,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3238
02:42:16,690 --> 02:42:17,070
Hold that angle.

3239
02:42:17,270 --> 02:42:17,550
Hold that.

3240
02:42:17,850 --> 02:42:18,330
Hold that hallway.

3241
02:42:18,450 --> 02:42:18,850
I got you.

3242
02:42:20,750 --> 02:42:21,870
But there's people on Gomez?

3243
02:42:23,230 --> 02:42:23,590
Or where?

3244
02:42:23,590 --> 02:42:24,450
Oh, okay.

3245
02:42:24,610 --> 02:42:24,830
Don't worry.

3246
02:42:24,930 --> 02:42:25,570
I have I have.

3247
02:42:26,110 --> 02:42:26,530
Oh, I see him.

3248
02:42:26,530 --> 02:42:27,090
I see him right here.

3249
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:27,730
Right here.

3250
02:42:27,810 --> 02:42:30,490
Watch out It's right there.

3251
02:42:32,730 --> 02:42:33,830
Motion detector motion.

3252
02:42:34,090 --> 02:42:34,470
Okay, badger.

3253
02:42:34,610 --> 02:42:34,830
Okay.

3254
02:42:35,270 --> 02:42:36,490
I hit short force head.

3255
02:42:38,310 --> 02:42:38,630
Nothing.

3256
02:42:38,630 --> 02:42:39,470
Don't they're over by you.

3257
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:40,170
I'm trying to pin them.

3258
02:42:40,250 --> 02:42:40,690
I'll try to pin them.

3259
02:42:40,830 --> 02:42:41,310
I'll go around.

3260
02:42:42,350 --> 02:42:44,210
This Glock got a switch, baby.

3261
02:42:45,250 --> 02:42:46,350
They still need Nintendo.

3262
02:42:46,670 --> 02:42:46,950
You got it.

3263
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:52,090
Oh, it's coming to be there.

3264
02:42:52,130 --> 02:42:53,250
Okay, they're blowing and they're coming.

3265
02:42:53,590 --> 02:42:53,850
I'm coming.

3266
02:42:54,490 --> 02:42:55,590
I'm coming.

3267
02:42:57,170 --> 02:42:57,690
Oh, my motion.

3268

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3269
02:42:59,570 --> 02:43:00,350
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3270

02:43:05,690 --> 02:43:05,930
I'm just.

3274
02:43:05,930 --> 02:43:06,810
Gomez team killed me.

3275
02:43:07,850 --> 02:43:09,330
Are you evil?

3276
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:10,330
Are you in?

3277
02:43:10,390 --> 02:43:11,250
No, I didn't.

3278
02:43:11,390 --> 02:43:11,850
I didn't shoot.

3279
02:43:11,910 --> 02:43:13,090
Are you a bad guy?

3280
02:43:14,310 --> 02:43:14,570
No.

3281
02:43:14,790 --> 02:43:15,370
He's Gomez.

3282
02:43:15,830 --> 02:43:16,590
Problematic media?

3283
02:43:17,110 --> 02:43:17,810

3387
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:34,170
No, Instagram.

3388
02:47:34,710 --> 02:47:35,750
Instagram is so much better.

3389
02:47:37,190 --> 02:47:37,390
Instagram?

3390
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:38,810
You told me...

3391
02:47:38,810 --> 02:47:39,110
Yeah.

3392
02:47:39,610 --> 02:47:40,870
Who uses Instagram?

3393
02:47:41,990 --> 02:47:43,270
I only use it for the memes.

3394
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:43,970
Only.

3395
02:47:45,170 --> 02:47:45,950
Like, if you...

3396
02:47:46,510 --> 02:47:47,930
Like, what else are you going to use Instagram for?

3397
02:47:49,070 --> 02:47:49,790
Like, what do you mean?

3398
02:47:49,970 --> 02:47:51,690
You tell me, suss emoji.

3399
02:47:51,690 --> 02:47:52,910
I thought only women used Instagram.

3400
02:47:53,130 --> 02:47:54,510
Also, I do watch YouTube shorts.

3401
02:47:55,310 --> 02:47:55,550
I do.

3402
02:47:57,630 --> 02:47:59,430
Is YouTube shorts as bad as TikTok?

3403
02:48:00,050 --> 02:48:01,370
I feel like it's same, isn't it?

3404
02:48:03,330 --> 02:48:03,970
Is it the same?

3405
02:48:04,110 --> 02:48:04,750
Someone said fat.

3406
02:48:05,010 --> 02:48:06,170
No, YouTube shorts.

3407
02:48:07,430 --> 02:48:07,850
What?

3408
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:10,430
I feel like if you're racist, you use Instagram.

3409
02:48:11,090 --> 02:48:11,530
What?

3410
02:48:11,970 --> 02:48:14,570
I feel like if, yeah, yeah.

3411
02:48:14,670 --> 02:48:16,510
Yeah, that's true.

3412
02:48:16,670 --> 02:48:17,450
That's pretty true.

3413
02:48:17,710 --> 02:48:18,110
That's true.

3414
02:48:18,330 --> 02:48:19,670
No, I'm not using it.

3415
02:48:19,790 --> 02:48:20,130
That's true.

3416
02:48:20,370 --> 02:48:21,030
No, I am not.

3417
02:48:21,070 --> 02:48:21,670
That's true.

3418
02:48:21,810 --> 02:48:23,010
I'm not using it because of it.

3419
02:48:23,130 --> 02:48:26,030
We keep saying that's true, but it has to be true.

3420
02:48:26,270 --> 02:48:26,470
Look at this.

3421
02:48:27,170 --> 02:48:27,590
How about this?

3422
02:48:27,710 --> 02:48:29,850
Do you have an Instagram account, Badge?

3423
02:48:32,590 --> 02:48:33,070
Me?

3424
02:48:33,430 --> 02:48:33,730
No.

3425
02:48:33,970 --> 02:48:34,450
Of course not.

3426
02:48:34,670 --> 02:48:35,050
Why would I?

3427
02:48:35,170 --> 02:48:35,430
Me?

3428
02:48:35,870 --> 02:48:36,190
No, dude.

3429
02:48:36,690 --> 02:48:40,510
But look at any bio Instagram post.

3430
02:48:40,870 --> 02:48:47,650
Look at any bio Instagram post and open up the comment
section and it will be completely indecipherable.

3431
02:48:47,930 --> 02:48:56,170
You never have Instagram, no account, but you need Instagram
to look at Instagram, but talking about the cops no all

3432
02:48:56,170 --> 02:49:03,190
right here's my workaround it gets cross-posted to Twitter
and they show you the comment section on on Instagram and

3433
02:49:03,190 --> 02:49:11,310
that is why I do not download Instagram all right we're
gonna be at Hospital B yeah as map is Hospital B attack or

3434
02:49:11,310 --> 02:49:22,970
defense uh you know what defense why not what okay okay
never mind tag no no no okay okay attack on team guys

3435
02:49:23,130 --> 02:49:29,990
defense defense defense defense okay okay what if you guys
type it out then what if you guys type it in chat uh d d d e

3436
02:49:29,990 --> 02:49:40,550
okay type it type it defensive okay hold on i misspelled
that so bad oh wait i put in the wrong who did you type it

3437
02:49:40,550 --> 02:49:49,250
to who the fuck did you type it to this college discord that
i'm coaching i was in there for no reason all right then we

3438
02:49:49,250 --> 02:50:01,590

3439
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:07,490

all right i feel like observer is kind of comfy right now

3440
02:50:07,490 --> 02:50:14,250
i'm in i'm in my observer i have a counterpoint you said
instagram users are racist but you just said that you use

3441
02:50:14,250 --> 02:50:20,370
twitter and i would say it but i'm going to i mean it's not
like twitter users can't also be racist.

3442
02:50:20,570 --> 02:50:22,110
I'm just saying that Instagram is racist.

3443
02:50:22,550 --> 02:50:27,490
I'm just saying that when she streams, she does bingo for
Instagram Reels.

3444
02:50:28,550 --> 02:50:32,930
Hey, let me tell you, every spot that says racism is always
in every stream.

3445
02:50:33,330 --> 02:50:34,470
That's, oh, it's checked in hard.

3446
02:50:34,850 --> 02:50:35,990
It's damn near a free space.

3447
02:50:36,550 --> 02:50:39,950
I mean, Grok did say he was Mecca.

3448
02:50:42,290 --> 02:50:45,170
I forgot to keep lobotomizing him.

3449
02:50:46,910 --> 02:50:48,970
They're not allowing it to be his true self.

3450
02:50:51,250 --> 02:50:55,060
you keep hitting them with anti-woke patches bro we gotta
fix them

You got the boat.

3714
03:04:21,510 --> 03:04:21,970
They're both down.

3715
03:04:22,150 --> 03:04:22,550
They're both down.

3716
03:04:22,730 --> 03:04:23,190
There's a third one.

3717
03:04:23,210 --> 03:04:24,310
There's a third one in this room.

3718

We were, I think we were definitely the most chaotic team.

3749
03:07:59,240 --> 03:08:04,520
I'm pretty sure the other teams were very, very much more
serious than our team.

3750
03:08:06,020 --> 03:08:09,920
The amount of team kills that we had as a team.

3751
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:10,880
I think we had more team.

3752
03:08:11,260 --> 03:08:15,120
Honestly, I'm pretty sure we had the most team kills out of
any team.

3753
03:08:15,380 --> 03:08:18,360
I don't even think any other team had team kills compared to
us.
