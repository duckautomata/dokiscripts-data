1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
I got it!

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,000
No no no no no.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,200
Where are you guys?

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,160
You wanna shoot this meat?

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,300
RUN!

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,700
RUN!

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,360
Oh my god!

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,620
Where are you guys?

9
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,680
Which one is Rune?

10
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,680
Which one is Rune?

11
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,260
I started my... we haven't introduced anybody.

12
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,060
We just went straight in.

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,800
Hello everybody!

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,760
We are here playing Who-phobia!

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,040
Who-phobia, yeah!

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,220
My name is Doki.

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,860
We're jumping right into it.

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,600
We're jumping right into it.

19
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,200
You guys missed out the saddest deer limping I've ever seen.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,840
It was so sad.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,380
It's great.

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,700
Anyway, should we all introduce ourselves?

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,300
Instead of being like, who the fuck are these people right now?

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,960
Just a bunch of people yelling, no big deal.

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,100
No big deal, no big deal.

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,420
Who wants to go first?

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,360
Who wants to go first?

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,200
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

29
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,040
No one was gonna say anything.

30
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,180
I was gonna say, guys?

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,120
Guys?

32
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:14,740
Guys?

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,600
Guys?

34
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,980
We are all dead, we're all dead.

35
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,360
We all just point to each other and we're like, not you!

36
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,680
Stupid.

37
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,520
Stupid!

38
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,220
Oh my god.

39
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,420
Oh my god.

40
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:24,480
Let's go!

41
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,900
Oh my god.

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,460
Would you like to explain your in-game name too?

43
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,340
No, no, no, don't explain it.

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,300
It's funnier that way.

45
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,380
That's my, that's my, um, that's my government name.

46
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,920
Oh yeah, yeah.

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,640
Wait, so Daddy's the last name?

49
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,580
Oh, my game crashed.

50
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,150
Great game, great game.

51
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,030
Great game, great game.

52
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,570
It's a title, like, it goes backwards.

53
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,570
Oh, so your first name is Daddy.

54
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,430
And then your last name is at Mercy.

55
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,110
It's like Mr., Mrs., Miss, Daddy.

56
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,690
Ishi, Wee, Wombo.

57
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,130
Oh, I'll do an imposter hunt.

58
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,570
That's the one where, like, everybody is a, there's like lots of deers.

59
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,410
And you have to figure out which is the right deer.

60
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,270
Yeah.

61
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,670
I was watching the trailer.

62
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,490
Apparently there's like, there's like a herd.

63
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,090
And you have to like pretend to be a deer.

64
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:24,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:24,990
Yeah.

66
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,830
What the hell.

67
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,270
Let's see.

68
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,990
All right, got you guys.

69
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,730
I invited you guys.

70
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,970
I sort of accidentally made the match public.

71
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,850
So please get in fast before I leave.

72
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,470
Oh.

73
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,230
Oh, oh.

74
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,230
But who's actually playing this game?

75
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,990
Well, now that I said that, people are gonna buy the game that hopefully I'm gonna make another public lobby.

76
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,050
You're welcome, Who-phobia.

77
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,610
You're welcome for the free advertising.

78
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,370
Not sponsored, by the way.

79
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,750
Yeah, not sponsored.

80
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,790
I was like, early access.

81
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,490
Wait.

82
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,350
Hold on.

83
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,050
What is this music?

84
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,590
It's called, yeah, what do you mean?

85
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,310
It's called Hunter Pride.

86
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,270
Art drop.

87
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,210
The music is killing me.

88
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,450
It was going crazy on the banjo.

89
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,490
The trailer is like, orchestral music.

90
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,250
It's kind of funny.

91
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,990
Oh, yeah, yeah.

92
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,430
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,890
Like, nada, bum bum bum, bum bum.

94
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,890
We're organized.

95
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,150
We're so organized.

96
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,630
We haven't even finished introducing ourselves.

97
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,550
Oh, yeah.

98
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,290
Oh, yeah.

99
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,570
Oh, my God.

100
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,070
Look at all these deers.

101
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,790
Fanlan Park.

102
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,070
Fanlan Park.

103
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,050
Wait, I think we just...

104
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,090
Oh, my God.

105
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,850
It's just like nada in Japan.

106
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,150
Okay.

107
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:44,550
Wow.

108
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,110
Who is...

109
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,250
Oh.

110
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,050
Oh, hey.

111
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,930
Who is the deer?

112
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,750
Who is the deer?

113
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,610
Yeah, guys.

114
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,350
Who's the deer?

115
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:52,710
I wonder.

116
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,870
Oh, no.

117
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,510
Oh, no, no, no.

118
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,610
You should have taken a shot.

119
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,890
You should have taken a shot.

120
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,990
Who's the deer?

121
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,070
Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,490
Before we get to it, do this, I guess.

123
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,670
Yeah, you should probably...

124
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,610
Wait, you killed me so hard that my stream died.

125
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,090
Man, I killed the game.

126
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,330
I killed the stream.

127
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,710
Stream died?

128
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,590
Wait, where did she go?

129
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,370
Where did she...

130
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,990
Yeah, what...

131
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,070
Where did she go?

132
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,610
Where am I, guys?

133
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,370
I'm scared.

134
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:36,990
Holy crap.

135
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,430
Wait, wait, wait.

136
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,370
I think I know where she is.

137
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,250
I think I...

138
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,050
Oh, no.

139
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,890
She doesn't know.

140
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,530
Oh, my God.

141
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,350
Oh, my God.

142
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:48,910
Goodbye.

143
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,210
Goodbye.

144
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,930
That's so loud.

145
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:52,810
It's terrifying.

146
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,250
Who is the deer?

147
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,410
She got the wrong one.

148
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,110
No.

149
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,530
Oh, that was a loud gunshot.

150
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,750
Mine's sanity.

151
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,070
I think I'm dead, guys.

152
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,190
Oh, my God.

153
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,230
I've been shot.

154
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,290
Oh, no.

155
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,870
Are you lifting?

156
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:15,870
Oh, my God.

157
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,530
Shit.

158
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,590
Oh, my God.

159
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,650
You killed the deer.

160
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,150
Oh, my God.

161
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,810
That's basically what it looked like when you get the deer.

162
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,150
It's the saddest thing ever.

163
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:25,850
Look at you.

164
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,430
I don't mind me.

165
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,550
Wait, your neck is bent completely.

166
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,270
Yeah, yeah.

167
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,350
Wait, wait, wait.

168
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,190
Look, look.

169
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,010
You wouldn't finish me off, would you?

170
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,650
Oh, no.

171
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,390
Don't worry.

172
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,300
No.

173
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,680
I'm a hero.

174
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,140
I'm a hero.

175
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,220
Oh, my God.

176
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,460
Jesus.

177
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:48,760
I got you.

178
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,220
I got you.

179
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,680
I got you.

180
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,300
There's no way she's gonna miss.

181
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,140
She's gonna miss.

182
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,580
Go get shot.

183
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,160
She's gonna miss.

184
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,260
Get him up.

185
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,920
Get him up.

186
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,460
I know you.

187
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,100
Get him up.

188
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,280
Get him up.

189
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,580
Get over here behind the tree.

190
00:05:59,580 --> 00:05:59,940
Get him up.

191
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,260
Behind the tree.

192
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,640
Get over here.

193
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,040
Behind the tree.

194
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:04,980
My line.

195
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,580
My line.

196
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,760
Stop moving.

197
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,960
I got you.

198
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,600
Just don't.

199
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:09,920
Okay.

200
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,900
Okay.

201
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,840
She can't shoot me.

202
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
I have tree as a cover.

203
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,600
I have tree as cover.

204
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,080
You were trying to find me.

205
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,200
Are you sure?

206
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,700
No.

207
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,440
I told you.

208
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,260
I told you she can't aim behind the tree.

209
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,240
Okay.

210
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,120
Wait.

211
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm just gonna eat her.

212
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,240
I got no aim assist by the tree.

213
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,600
Okay.

214
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,000
Wait, wait.

215
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,380
Okay.

216
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:26,800
Here you go.

217
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,800
I got you.

218
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,820
I got you.

219
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,700
There you go.

220
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,860
I got you.

221
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,300
You didn't even give me a chance.

222
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,160
I got you.

223
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,200
Just keep standing behind the tree.

224
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,760
Don't worry.

225
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,180
No.

226
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,520
Hey, hey.

227
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:42,800
Hey.

228
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,180
I'm trying.

229
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm trying.

230
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,580
I'm trying.

231
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,300
You're trying so hard.

232
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,680
Oh, there's a deer body blocking.

233
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,000
There you go.

234
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,960
Yes, you have to keep running.

235
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,040
Oh my god.

236
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,700
I can't see.

237
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,020
I have a t-shirt in my hand.

238
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,700
I got aim.

239
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,240
Okay.

240
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,800
Go here.

241
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,280
Get closer.

242
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,340
Get closer.

243
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,940
The tree will save us.

244
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,580
The tree will save us.

245
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,040
The tree will save us.

246
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,880
Move.

247
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,800
Move.

248
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,420
Move.

249
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,920
Oh my god.

250
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,560
Okay.

251
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,240
All right.

252
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,180
All right.

253
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,560
Okay.

254
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:15,860
I'm gonna...

255
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,440
Get closer.

256
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,960
Get closer to the tree.

257
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,520
You missed.

258
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,000
You missed.

259
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,820
Okay.

260
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,100
I got you.

261
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,020
I got you.

262
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,920
She's distracted.

263
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,380
You're free.

264
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,140
You missed.

265
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,640
Stop it.

266
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,180
You're free.

267
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,120
Take that.

268
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,060
Oh my god.

269
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,580
Oh, yeah.

270
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,820
You're gonna miss again.

271
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,640
We got him, fellas.

272
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,180
We got him.

273
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,300
We got that.

274
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,280
Kidding.

275
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,060
Wasn't me.

276
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,500
You got it.

277
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,220
You want to play the swings?

278
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,860
You want to play the swings?

279
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,720
Oh my god, what the fuck?

280
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,740
I'm standing.

281
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,620
I'm standing.

282
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,140
What is this?

283
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,420
What the hell is that?

284
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,520
You were like wheeling.

285
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,300
What's up?

286
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,040
You've never seen a deer stand on two feet?

287
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,700
Oh my god.

288
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,660
Yeah, never saw that.

289
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,560
Alright, don't worry chat.

290
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,220
I lowered the game.

291
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,260
Holy shit.

292
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,040
This is the game of the year.

293
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,220
Game of the year, Goaty.

294
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,320
Alright, quick, before the game starts, go!

295
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,240
Quick!

296
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,300
Oh my god, wait, who's the...

297
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,920
Oh, okay.

298
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,900
Oh...

299
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,360
You'll never know who it is.

300
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,900
Oh, oh.

301
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,540
Woah.

302
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
This is the worst.

303
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,300
Woah.

304
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,460
Who's the deer?

305
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm Sayu.

306
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,760
And I'm the one with the gun.

307
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,460
Oh!

308
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,180
Yes!

309
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,420
Hello.

310
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,820
Quick, come over here, behind the tree.

311
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,980
That works every time.

312
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,160
Quick,

313
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,420
quick.

314
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,860
Oh my god, my neck.

315
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,740
What the frick...

316
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,860
I'm tickling his toes!

317
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm tickling his toes!

318
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,760
There's no way you can't hit me!

319
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,620
I'm tickling your toes!

320
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm tickling your toes!

321
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,340
That's why you have to reload by sucking the...

322
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,820
You can't hit me!

323
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:22,820
You can't hit me!

324
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:22,820
No!

325
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,500
No!

326
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,380
Frick!

327
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,600
Oh yeah!

328
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,720
Anyway, sorry.

329
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,700
We forgot to introduce ourselves again.

330
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,340
We're all so distracted by the deer.

331
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,180
The only person who's been introduced is having my seat back.

332
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,340
Yeah!

333
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,240
Have mercy daddy!

334
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,680
Oh my god.

335
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,620
He killed all the skinwalkers.

336
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Oh god.

337
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,120
Alright, before we start shooting...

338
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,460
Let's introduce ourselves.

339
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,660
Let's introduce ourselves.

340
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,200
I'll go, I'll go.

341
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,480
Hello, it's me!

342
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,480
Have mercy daddy!

343
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,540
A.K.A.

344
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,920
Amelie.

345
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,500
Hello, hello.

346
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,520
I am a voice actor and Vtuber.

347
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,100
Nice to meet you.

348
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,160
You may have heard me in anime or video games.

349
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,600
Such as My Dress of Darling as Maureen or Uta in One Piece Film Red.

350
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,980
Among many others.

351
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,240
That's her!

352
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,960
That's me!

353
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,680
Wow!

354
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
We have mercy daddy.

355
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,740
We have mercy daddy?

356
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,200
We have mercy daddy?

357
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,900
We daddy of mercies?

358
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,900
Wow.

359
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,580
Wow.

360
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,940
No mercy will be halved in this deer game.

361
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,460
Sure won't.

362
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,500
Wait, who has the gun now?

363
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,280
Not me.

364
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,780
I think it's Fruit.

365
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,560
No...

366
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,600
Yeah, yeah it is!

367
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,560
Alright Fruit, since you have the gun and could kill us at any moment.

368
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,340
Who are you?

369
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,900
Yeah, I totally have a gun.

370
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,180
Hello, I'm Apricot.

371
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,760
Also known as Fruit and...

372
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,500
I am a part-time frog!

373
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,560
Part-time frog?

374
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,600
When did you become a frog?

375
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,540
I'm a frog.

376
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,640
Since I could go...

377
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,680
That's why she's...

378
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,160
That's why she's...

379
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,120
Part-time.

380
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,760
Part-time.

381
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,540
She's still interning right now.

382
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,960
Under the frog ship.

383
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,260
I'm an intern.

384
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,060
I'm a frog intern.

385
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,380
Frog intern.

386
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,320
Alright, hello everybody!

387
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,740
I'm Doki.

388
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,280
A.K.A Doki Bird.

389
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,620
That's it.

390
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,660
There's nothing else.

391
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,780
Good.

392
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,720
Right intro.

393
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,540
Yo!

394
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,360
I'm Sayu.

395
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,300
I'm a Vtuber, voice actor, and...

396
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,620
things.

397
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,240
I've been in Genshin as Saino.

398
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,600
If you wanna hear a dad joke, I got a dad joke book here.

399
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,180
Alright, hold on.

400
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,540
Uh...

401
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,280
Did you hear about the cowboy with dietary restrictions?

402
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,000
Did you hear about the cowboy with dietary restrictions?

403
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,500
He was rootin' tootin' free of gluten!

404
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,280
Oh my god!

405
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,500
I have, uh...

406
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,920
Fans have given me two versions, actually.

407
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,920
I have another book of these.

408
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,540
Uh... and yeah.

409
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,380
That's me.

410
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,300
I've voiced in other things.

411
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,440
But you can look it up.

412
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,200
But yeah.

413
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,740
Hello.

414
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,120
I'm here to, uh...

415
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,620
kill the hunter today.

416
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,440
Or, you know, kill some deer.

417
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,240
Depending on who I'm playing as.

418
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,060
Your team hunter?

419
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,260
Despicable.

420
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,660
Oh my... how dare you.

421
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,620
Do you hate deer?

422
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,660
Do you hate the environment?

423
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,460
Oh wait, it's Monarch?

424
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:37,920
Yeah!

425
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

426
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,920
I can't believe you.

427
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:43,840
Stop it!

428
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:44,980
Stop it!

429
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,720
Yeah, that's right!

430
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,120
You're at the wrong territory!

431
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,560
You fucking...

432
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,060
Guys, revive me.

433
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,200
Revive me.

434
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,160
Please, I'm living.

435
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,460
Get in the bush, get in the bush.

436
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,940
You son of a bitch!

437
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm in the bush!

438
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,800
Get in the bush!

439
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,200
Wait, up look, up look.

440
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:05,800
I'm dying!

441
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,800
She's gonna shoot in the bush!

442
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,120
I'm okay.

443
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,820
She can't aim in bushes!

444
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,820
She can't aim in bushes!

445
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,300
I'm okay.

446
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm okay.

447
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,520
Wait, wait, you forgot to...

448
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:15,700
No!

449
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,280
Idiot!

450
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,380
Revive, revive!

451
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,460
She's in the bush!

452
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,320
I can't even think of my tears!

453
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,240
Oh my god!

454
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,080
Oh no!

455
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,160
Oh no!

456
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,160
I'm not okay.

457
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,380
Wait, did you die?

458
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:33,880
I'm not okay.

459
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,220
I don't know.

460
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,400
I'm still alive.

461
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,760
But I'm not okay.

462
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,440
I'm not okay.

463
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,360
Why is there scary music?

464
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,440
What is happening?

465
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,160
What is happening?

466
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,120
Yeah, stupid!

467
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
Oh, that's like full insanity.

468
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,200
Oh my god.

469
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,540
Oh, hunter insanity.

470
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,900
I was like, what's that countdown?

471
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:56,940
Yeah.

472
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,940
What's that deer in my ears?

473
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,300
Oh, if you don't kill the deer fast enough, the deer becomes sentient.

474
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,780
That's right.

475
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,140
The deer evolves.

476
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,700
The other deer?

477
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,480
We're gonna grab your gun and we're gonna shoot you.

478
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,080
That's right.

479
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,960
Let's see.

480
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,860
True story.

481
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,800
Oh, fruit's the hunter.

482
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,640
Fruit's the hunter.

483
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,720
Yeah, it ends up talking.

484
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,140
You know what?

485
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,400
I hate more than deer on this place.

486
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,820
What do you hate more than deer?

487
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,380
Ah!

488
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,480
It could be any of us, Fruit.

489
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,600
We could be right behind you right now.

490
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,040
I just hit...

491
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,240
Eating the grass.

492
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,240
And this is the scariest thing I've ever heard in my life.

493
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,740
We could be right to your left.

494
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,340
Or to your right.

495
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,240
Are you following me?

496
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,640
That could be us.

497
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,640
Right now.

498
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,040
I could be right behind you.

499
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,760
Oh my god!

500
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,000
Holy crap!

501
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:00,460
I'm so scared!

502
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,780
I'm so scared!

503
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,620
Who's the actual deer?

504
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,000
Who's the imposter?

505
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,460
I wonder if I can fix my FOV.

506
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,960
Oh no, don't.

507
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,420
There is no FOV settings.

508
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,420
I checked.

509
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,660
You think this game has FOV settings?

510
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,360
This game has like...

511
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,980
Oh shit!

512
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,680
You died?

513
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,620
Oh no, don't worry.

514
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,180
I tried to rush her.

515
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,260
Oh my god!

516
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,940
Get behind the tree!

517
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,220
Get behind the tree!

518
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,760
Get behind the tree!

519
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,420
Don't worry!

520
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,920
Oh shit!

521
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,880
She doesn't know.

522
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,740
I found a guy on you!

523
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,400
What the frick?

524
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,780
Don't worry, she didn't know.

525
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,540
Staying to the corner I see.

526
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,080
Stand behind the tree, Emily!

527
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,140
What are you doing?

528
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,100
I can hit my footsteps behind me.

529
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,840
It's so scary.

530
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,920
The closest tree.

531
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,820
The bushes!

532
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,620
Yeah, the bushes work.

533
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,700
The bushes work.

534
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,560
Okay.

535
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,120
Hey, I wonder if that's suspicious at all.

536
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,880
I'm shooting you!

537
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
Oh my god!

538
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,540
Relax!

539
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,880
Relax!

540
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,320
I'm shooting you!

541
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,900
Oh my god!

542
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,000
Jesus Christ!

543
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
I got you!

544
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,200
The sanity!

545
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh my god!

546
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,400
It's crazy now!

547
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,820
We have no other choice!

548
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,380
You pushed me!

549
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,680
You pushed me!

550
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,280
You pushed me!

551
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,780
You pushed me!

552
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,320
I need to reload!

553
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,000
Holy crap!

554
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,140
Bro, Fruit, when you...

555
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,380
You are the scariest!

556
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,420
I don't f***ing know what you did!

557
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,060
You flung me to the other side of the f***ing map!

558
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,120
Oh my god!

559
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,180
Oh my god!

560
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,820
Okay, we'll do one more of this, one more of this game mode cause there's like four game modes!

561
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,700
There's four different game modes!

562
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,140
Oh my god!

563
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,000
We have now started.

564
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,100
I can't leave the...

565
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,440
My settings are broken!

566
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,460
Can't leave at all!

567
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,380
I'm stuck in the settings!

568
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,040
It doesn't work!

569
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,920
No!

570
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,260
No!

571
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,980
I'm gonna be blind.

572
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,120
I'm blind.

573
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,120
Don't worry.

574
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,860
I have my ears.

575
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,380
I have my ears.

576
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,620
Jesus.

577
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,080
I'm shooting everything.

578
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,120
I'm shooting.

579
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,180
I'm like stuck in the...

580
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,400
Oh, you can't see us, can you?

581
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,280
You wanna bully a blind man with you?

582
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah, time to bully.

583
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
We're doing that right now.

584
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,740
No!

585
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm in bed.

586
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,180
I'm in bed.

587
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,660
I'm in bed.

588
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,160
That's right.

589
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,120
You can't see.

590
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,520
You can't see.

591
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,560
I'm in bed.

592
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,320
I can't see anything.

593
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,500
Don't worry.

594
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:00,920
I got you.

595
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,780
I can't see anything.

596
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,800
I'm gonna eat the grass.

597
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,760
No!

598
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,660
It's hunting season.

599
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,200
Guys.

600
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,900
Guys, I'm limping.

601
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,660
Please.

602
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,300
I'm stuck.

603
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,860
I'm not trying to play the game.

604
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,080
So, Suvi, you are...

605
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,420
I'm in bed.

606
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,200
Guys, revive me.

607
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,840
Eat the grass.

608
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,640
Eat the grass and I'll come back to life.

609
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:25,920
Oh!

610
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,340
Oh, you're going crazy.

611
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,600
All I see is brown blurs.

612
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,380
I just see brown blurs.

613
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,780
Yeah?

614
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,580
See this?

615
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
I need glasses.

616
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,960
I love my glasses.

617
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,860
I wanna revive.

618
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,720
How do you revive?

619
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,740
I wanna revive.

620
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,340
You need to revive.

621
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,160
I got two layers of settings.

622
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,580
What?

623
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,980
Oh, no.

624
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,680
What exactly happened?

625
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,400
She got stuck in her settings page.

626
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,220
Yeah, cause I'm the...

627
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,260
In your settings page.

628
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,760
Yeah, it's early access.

629
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,000
Alright, fellas.

630
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,760
If anybody comes near me, you're done.

631
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,700
Oh.

632
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,540
Yeah, but the more tears you kill, the crazier you get.

633
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
Oh, you're already almost crazy.

634
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,900
So you're saying I should just make y'all stand up?

635
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,320
Oh, fuck.

636
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,680
Oh, whoa, whoa.

637
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,360
I'm not Slim Shady.

638
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,340
I'm not Slim Shady.

639
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,200
You think I don't see you in them bushes?

640
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,180
Yeah, that's fucking wrong.

641
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,600
You can't aim for shit.

642
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,220
It's not that I couldn't aim.

643
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,360
It's just that I'm getting surrounded.

644
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:34,960
Ah!

645
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,540
Ah!

646
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,860
Oh, my god.

647
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,300
We're gonna stand up soon, Si.

648
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,560
We're gonna be standing up soon.

649
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,780
Get away from me, you freaks!

650
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:48,480
Ah!

651
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,860
Ah!

652
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,560
Ah!

653
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,600
Surround him.

654
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,400
I got stuck in a pumpkin.

655
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Oh, whoa.

656
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,700
You're crazy now.

657
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,240
Crazy on the side.

658
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,760
This is terrifying.

659
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,900
Yeah, this is so scary.

660
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,740
Okay, I'll start a new lobby.

661
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,940
Okay, okay, okay.

662
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,280
So Hunter and Sam.

663
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,780
Insanity.

664
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,940
It's like the more insane you are, like they get up, but then if you get hit, you're fucked.

665
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,060
Yeah, then you lose automatically.

666
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,640
They have more HP too.

667
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,300
Gotcha.

668
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,500
I don't know what stay close is.

669
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,840
I think stay close is...

670
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,460
You get a point if you're in proximity, I think.

671
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,740
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,680
So you have to figure out who is the right deer.

673
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,640
Yeah.

674
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,260
Like if a deer is close to you.

675
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,280
Yeah, like if a fake deer, the skinwalker deer.

676
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,660
Can I ask what inspired you to want to play this game?

677
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
Look, it's very hard to find multiplayer games.

678
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,220
Sure, sure.

679
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,140
No disagreement there.

680
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,980
But I'm just like...

681
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,280
I saw this trailer and I was like, oh, sweet.

682
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,120
This looks cool.

683
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,920
But then when it came out, there was no multiplayer.

684
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,440
It was like, why?

685
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,200
It was like, there's no private server.

686
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,220
So I was like, okay, maybe another time.

687
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,720
And then I heard they recently updated it with private servers.

688
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,940
And I was like, this is it.

689
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,720
This is my time to shine.

690
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,420
You're the one person on Steam, you're like constantly checking.

691
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,580
It's like, I'm waiting.

692
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,560
There's private servers.

693
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,000
You were the one target audience.

694
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,200
They updated for you.

695
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,520
This is...

696
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,720
This is gonna be the next streamer game.

697
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,980
I can feel it.

698
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,920
It's just the private servers.

699
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,020
Last update was March 5th.

700
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,700
I'll give them that.

701
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,740
Biggest issue with the sound setting slider is not having any of that.

702
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,820
Guys, if the devs are watching this, please, we want sensitivity settings.

703
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:54,920
Oh, yes.

704
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,860
Mouse sensitivity.

705
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,500
Please.

706
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,980
I want outfits.

707
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,940
I want cosmetics.

708
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,340
You want...

709
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,700
I wanna give the deer a top hat.

710
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,740
Yeah.

711
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,900
That's definitely gonna make sure that, you know, that the deer is wearing a top hat.

712
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,680
You're definitely not the deer.

713
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,600
Wait.

714
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,780
But they have to give random cosmetics to the other deer.

715
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,900
Yeah, the other deer have random cosmetics.

716
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,720
I'm not gonna lie, fellas.

717
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.

718
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,560
A deer with a clown nose.

719
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,860
We have to go to the hunter.

720
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,420
You see the big beam in the sky?

721
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,480
Like moving around.

722
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
Oh, the what?

723
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,860
Sorry.

724
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,160
Where's the deer?

725
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,280
Where's the honey?

726
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,260
Where is he?

727
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,900
He's very close to you.

728
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,000
Huh?

729
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,260
Or am I lying?

730
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,660
I'll never tell.

731
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,420
Oh, those are my footsteps.

732
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,840
I'm gonna instead of my own footsteps.

733
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,340
But I know I'll know of a deer's footsteps when I hear them.

734
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,800
You sound like the guy that did the voiceover for the trailer.

735
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,940
Oh, really?

736
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,780
Maybe I did.

737
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,100
I actually don't know.

738
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,900
You're pro bono.

739
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,460
You heard the concept.

740
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:17,520
I watched the trailer and I thought there was gonna be voiceover for the hunter.

741
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,000
Because in the trailer he's like, You effin' deer.

742
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,940
There is.

743
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,440
But it's just so quiet.

744
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,860
Oh, really?

745
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,300
Yeah, when you spawn in he starts spewing a bunch of stuff.

746
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,280
But it's so quiet.

747
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,680
All he's like...

748
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,980
Where the fuck is he?

749
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,160
That's what I'm saying.

750
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,720
Where the fuck are they?

751
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,580
I'm deer hunting, not sightseeing.

752
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,780
What's going on?

753
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,160
The moment Si sees just one of us, he's just gonna start shooting.

754
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,860
He doesn't care.

755
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,580
He's just like, Deer spotted.

756
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,860
I'm hunting deer.

757
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,400
I don't see any fake deer.

758
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,440
Do you guys see any fake deer?

759
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
No, I don't.

760
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,340
Oh, maybe it's more so like hiding next to him.

761
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,720
Oh.

762
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,240
That's what the crouch button is for.

763
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,640
That's why there's so many trees and bushes.

764
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,480
Oh yeah, there's a crouch button.

765
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,260
Yeah, yeah.

766
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,520
Wait, it is!

767
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,400
We have to hide behind him.

768
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,360
We're being paranoid.

769
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,840
I see a deer across the forest just crouching.

770
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,240
What the fuck is that?

771
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,360
I wonder who that could be.

772
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,660
Like, look across the forest.

773
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,880
Look across, you might see me.

774
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,340
Turn around.

775
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,120
I see you crouch spamming.

776
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,340
Oh no, that must be fruit.

777
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,100
That must be fruit.

778
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,360
Yeah.

779
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,180
Must be nice knowing where the deer are.

780
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,200
Yeah.

781
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,560
Yeah, like be nice.

782
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,480
I mean, just give us the coordinates.

783
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,280
Wait, I see...

784
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,220
Okay, wait, that's you.

785
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,700
Dude, I can't even give you the coordinates if I wanted to.

786
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,440
Who the fuck is he?

787
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,980
One of us will find him.

788
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,720
How close are we?

789
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,880
You see, look in the sky.

790
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,220
Look, look, look.

791
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,500
I'll signal you guys.

792
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,380
Look in the sky.

793
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,380
Oh, I see him.

794
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,700
He's really close by.

795
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,400
Oh, there's like a thing in the sky that shows where he is.

796
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,200
Oh, I see it.

797
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:09,920
He's like an alien.

798
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,660
I see it.

799
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,500
Oh my god, we're close.

800
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,220
I knew those deer were out of this world.

801
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,440
Sia, we're right by you.

802
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,240
We're next to you.

803
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,400
Yes, we are.

804
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,080
I don't need to prove it.

805
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,740
Oh, I see you shooting in your orange jacket.

806
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,220
Oh, I see you shooting in your orange jacket.

807
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,600
You're aiming right down to the west.

808
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,180
We see you, Sia.

809
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,860
I actually don't like that.

810
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,280
I don't like that.

811
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,400
Why are you running?

812
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,260
Why are you running?

813
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,960
Why are you running, Sia?

814
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,220
Wait a second, hold on.

815
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
What are you doing?

816
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,160
Oh, I see you.

817
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,360
You're looking to the right.

818
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,820
I just wanted to see if the sound effects were the same as the deer running.

819
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,640
Like if I ran, if they're the same sounds as deer running.

820
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,180
Why are you running to the right?

821
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,280
I don't like this game.

822
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,580
We could be anywhere.

823
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,100
We could be in front of you.

824
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,280
We could be behind you.

825
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,520
You know what's the worst part?

826
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,700
There's like a radius around me that is clearly that thing you guys are talking about.

827
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,780
You can see it.

828
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,800
Like when I zoom in, it looks like it's a deer.

829
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,680
It blocks out some of the stuff so I can't even see.

830
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,660
It blocks out some of the stuff so I can't even see.

831
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:36,980
Oh.

832
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,840
Oh my god!

833
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,340
No!

834
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,800
I'm back!

835
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,380
He's getting crazy!

836
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,380
Get in!

837
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,740
Get in!

838
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,960
Get in the circle!

839
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,800
We can come back, Sia.

840
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,460
We come back.

841
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,900
Wait, I respawned.

842
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,140
Yeah.

843
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,280
You can't kill us forever.

844
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,060
Oh god.

845
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,900
We come back.

846
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,100
These deer are fucking crazy.

847
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,260
Don't keep moving.

848
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,460
No, we could be in front of you.

849
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,380
You don't know that.

850
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,620
I could already be right next to you in a bush.

851
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,460
Yeah.

852
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,380
Get in the circle!

853
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:22,880
Get in the circle!

854
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,900
Oh.

855
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,080
I sneaked right in.

856
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,580
I sneaked...

857
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,020
Yeah, that's right.

858
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,760
You don't give a terrible shot!

859
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,960
That's right.

860
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,740
You don't know where we are now.

861
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,980
My chat's like Five Nights in the Forest.

862
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,880
We're right behind you.

863
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,440
Oh god!

864
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,540
This is terrifying!

865
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,780
Oh, you sigh.

866
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,240
I don't like this game anymore.

867
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
Oh shit!

868
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,920
I won't die you!

869
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,280
No!

870
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,220
It's like the Slenderman.

871
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,680
The eight pages collect the eighth page.

872
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,380
Maybe if I get high ground.

873
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,940
Where is he?

874
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,920
Oh no!

875
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,180
It's only five minutes.

876
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:16,700
Who won?

877
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,440
How do you know who wins that?

878
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,620
You won because we didn't make you go crazy.

879
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,140
Yeah.

880
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,000
We just made you...

881
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,260
Yeah, we just made you slightly paranoid.

882
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,580
Oh, okay.

883
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,780
Man, I killed that shit!

884
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,900
You feel anxious?

885
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,740
You feel an anxious?

886
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,740
To be fair, the first half of this was us figuring out how to play.

887
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,840
Yeah, true.

888
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,740
Don't worry guys.

889
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,660
If I'm a...

890
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,880
Okay, I know how to troll.

891
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,540
I'm here.

892
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,440
I know what I'm doing.

893
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,660
You know what the...

894
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,820
site looks like.

895
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,620
Okay guys.

896
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,880
Hey guys.

897
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,680
I'm in my neighbor chair.

898
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,720
I'm in my neighbor position.

899
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,800
Did you put your glasses on?

900
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,940
I think you'll need them.

901
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,160
I see you.

902
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,500
I see you.

903
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,020
Where?

904
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,000
Next to you.

905
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,580
Where?

906
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,620
You would like to know where.

907
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,360
You had...

908
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,240
She's coming right for us.

909
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
She's coming right to us.

910
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,300
We gotta make her go crazy.

911
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,380
Oh my ass!

912
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,640
What?

913
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Oh, she missed.

914
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,020
She missed.

915
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,280
She doesn't know where I am anymore after that.

916
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:31,920
I just spawned, bro!

917
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,880
Let me play!

918
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,240
She doesn't know.

919
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,640
She's scared.

920
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,420
I see you running back and forth.

921
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,720
Back and forth.

922
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,480
What?

923
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,360
I see you.

924
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,360
That's right!

925
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,280
Oh my god!

926
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,600
That's a D.

927
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:50,860
Red!

928
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,980
Oh, there's a bounce!

929
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,920
Oh!

930
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,480
Oh!

931
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,880
I'm good.

932
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,160
Where am I?

933
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,000
Where am I?

934
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,420
You should...

935
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,280
I'm

936
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,840
locked!

937
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,340
You locked her!

938
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,800
She's locked there!

939
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,400
I'm locked there!

940
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,460
I'm locked there!

941
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,500
She's going to Zed!

942
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,480
Oh no!

943
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,780
I'm locked in!

944
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,040
Kill me!

945
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:27,880
Don't worry!

946
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,100
She can't aim!

947
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,080
Whenever they kill a deer!

948
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:34,780
Oh!

949
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,740
Guys, we worked so hard!

950
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,040
We had to die now!

951
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
I see now!

952
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,940
I fixed it!

953
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,920
She just turned to me!

954
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,440
Holy crap!

955
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,360
We worked so hard getting that meter up, guys.

956
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,820
We have to be more stealthy.

957
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,680
So this really is a stealth game.

958
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,460
Where are you guys?

959
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,000
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

960
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,040
Please, please, I have a family.

961
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,400
I have a family of deers, please.

962
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,640
You wouldn't kill Bambi's father, would you?

963
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,180
Guys, you can... I distracted a...

964
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,060
Oh no!

965
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,220
You wouldn't kill the father of Bambi now, would you?

966
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,980
Oh, I 100% would.

967
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,340
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

968
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,660
He's an asshole!

969
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
What do you mean?

970
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,440
Have you not seen Bambi 2?

971
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,980
I think I'm like the one person that saw Bambi 2.

972
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,300
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, do you want that?

973
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,340
You put the glasses on!

974
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,420
I am the ten people that watch Bambi 2.

975
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:33,860
Are you running?

976
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,400
I won't!

977
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

978
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,900
I'm gonna run in a circle!

979
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,720
Serpentine, serpentine!

980
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,140
Oh, it's working!

981
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,300
What am I, a gator?

982
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,060
Oh, shit!

983
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,260
Wait, why are you here?

984
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,620
Oh, it would be great if there were fake deers on this map.

985
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,420
Oh, shit!

986
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Wait, why are you here?

987
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, but there's lots of bushes, though.

988
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,680
Bushes!

989
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,660
We have the bushes for cover.

990
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,280
I think we might have glitched the hunter and chenny.

991
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,840
No!

992
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,460
No, it lost us the points!

993
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,320
But they stayed.

994
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,540
Holy shit, this one's harder.

995
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,020
This one's so...

996
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,580
The reset is hard.

997
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,340
Why are you hiding in that bush, Monarch?

998
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,020
Why are you hiding in that bush, Monarch?

999
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,380
But then, if we all hide in bushes, she can't see us.

1000
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,540
The hunter becomes the hunted.

1001
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,920
Why are you hiding in that bush?

1002
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,480
What?!

1003
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,480
The hunter becomes the hunted.

1004
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,920
How did you know?!

1005
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,020
I saw your little booty!

1006
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,380
I saw your little pixels!

1007
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,460
Surely she can't see me, chat.

1008
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,240
Well, I know for sure you're not in the circle.

1009
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,640
She can't see me, chat.

1010
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,180
There's no way.

1011
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,280
There's no way.

1012
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,520
Where did she go?

1013
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,960
Do what?

1014
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,620
Do what?

1015
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,080
Do what?

1016
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,740
What are you doing?

1017
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:52,500
What are you doing?

1018
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,240
Get away from me!

1019
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,960
You want to rape that bitch?!

1020
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,400
What are you doing?

1021
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,920
Whoa!

1022
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,120
You can't hit in this game!

1023
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,440
Guys, don't forget!

1024
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,400
Don't forget, guys.

1025
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,040
We can crouch.

1026
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,200
She can't.

1027
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,400
She can shoot though.

1028
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,480
It's okay.

1029
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,120
She doesn't know.

1030
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,180
She's standing in the open!

1031
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,900
Oh my god!

1032
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,860
I got launched!

1033
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,420
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1034
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1035
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1036
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,760
No, please, they see!

1037
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,940
You don't know anymore.

1038
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,080
What's funny is I'm like...

1039
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,760
I'm like spamming reload every time I see something.

1040
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,500
I'm in the shadows.

1041
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,420
Is it working out?

1042
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,840
She hasn't got me yet.

1043
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,660
Bro, she's so paranoid!

1044
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,720
I'm shaking!

1045
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,440
I'm shaking in my boots!

1046
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,100
I'm shaking!

1047
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,360
Bro, it's like she every Saturday goes out and...

1048
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh dear, this is not an amateur.

1049
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,600
This is not an amateur.

1050
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,200
She definitely killed Bambi before.

1051
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,700
Yeah.

1052
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,060
She's a Bambi killer.

1053
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,840
I can feel it.

1054
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,160
That's not...

1055
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,060
She's a prodigy.

1056
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,940
She got me.

1057
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,080
Apex Legends, baby.

1058
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,120
Dude, I...

1059
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,780
I actually do think we may have glitched the insanity a bit.

1060
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,880
No, no, no, wait up a little bit.

1061
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,060
I saw it go up.

1062
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,380
We just keep dying.

1063
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,180
Okay, there's 20 seconds on the clock.

1064
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,460
Just to test it out.

1065
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,340
Monarch, don't kill us.

1066
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,600
Let's just be in the circle.

1067
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,540
All in the open.

1068
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,640
Just to test it out.

1069
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,980
She ran past me.

1070
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,380
I got a little bit.

1071
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,300
We're just helpless little deer.

1072
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,920
We're just helpless little deer.

1073
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,220
We're helpless little deer.

1074
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,860
We just wanna talk.

1075
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,440
We just wanna talk.

1076
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,220
Uh oh.

1077
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,520
Well, I just wanna talk.

1078
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,800
Talking's over.

1079
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,860
Talking's over.

1080
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,200
No one is talking.

1081
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,980
Oh my god, I feel like...

1082
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,640
Wait, why is the insanity going up?

1083
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,260
We're not even playing the game.

1084
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,920
Did we spawn?

1085
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,000
I was just thinking, one of us spawned into the circle.

1086
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,440
I was locked in, baby.

1087
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,240
What?

1088
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,780
I'm the killer again?

1089
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,300
Alright, alright, alright.

1090
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,440
We just wanna talk.

1091
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,780
We just wanna talk.

1092
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,940
Use flashlight.

1093
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,940
There's a flashlight?

1094
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,280
There's a flashlight?

1095
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,580
Wait, there's a flashlight?

1096
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,460
I'm glitched in the grass.

1097
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,700
This is our chance, guys.

1098
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,460
This is it.

1099
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,500
We could win.

1100
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,160
Go, go, go, go.

1101
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,400
She's stuck.

1102
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,640
Go, go, go, go.

1103
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,980
I don't see anything.

1104
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,660
Don't you worry.

1105
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,080
Oh, yes, yes.

1106
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,940
Oh, no.

1107
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,460
What's the shame?

1108
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,000
Do you hear that?

1109
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,240
Clip, clop.

1110
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,000
Clip, clip.

1111
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,360
Clip, clop.

1112
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,340
I think it's like deer T6.

1113
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,680
Go.

1114
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,940
Man, we're...

1115
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,980
I can't see shit.

1116
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,040
You won't see shit.

1117
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,360
You will never see anything.

1118
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,280
I can't see anything.

1119
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,080
The grass is so thick.

1120
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,840
The tall grass.

1121
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,800
Get out of the tall grass.

1122
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,460
She's running away.

1123
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,920
While Pokemon comes for you.

1124
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,060
Nice shot.

1125
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,060
No, die.

1126
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,680
I swear to God.

1127
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,420
Don't die.

1128
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,680
The sand.

1129
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,180
The grass.

1130
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,140
We're so close.

1131
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,240
We can't climb up.

1132
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,880
No.

1133
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,320
Friend, don't die.

1134
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,380
I'm going.

1135
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,200
Just hide in the grass.

1136
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,460
Just hide in the grass.

1137
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,060
I gotta go to Candy Mountain.

1138
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,220
Come on.

1139
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,380
The water is so loud.

1140
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,120
Dude, the water is extremely loud.

1141
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:02,900
That's it.

1142
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,560
That makes her more paranoid.

1143
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:04,980
Woo.

1144
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,300
Where am I?

1145
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,860
Where am I now?

1146
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,740
We almost got this.

1147
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,540
I can't see shit.

1148
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:14,700
I can't see shit.

1149
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,960
You should have called the wild grass when you had the chance.

1150
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,380
Wow.

1151
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,700
You're the coolest bitch.

1152
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,140
You better run.

1153
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:27,980
Yes, right.

1154
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,800
Run.

1155
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,780
So wait, what happened?

1156
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,400
I was like a foot tall.

1157
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,420
I was like an ant.

1158
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,880
She couldn't see past the wild grass.

1159
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,200
Oh my god.

1160
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,600
An animated movie?

1161
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,080
Oh, when you lost?

1162
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,320
No, that whole time.

1163
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,780
The whole game.

1164
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,120
Oh.

1165
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,280
Why?

1166
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,300
Yeah, because she was too short for the tall grass.

1167
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,680
You know, like in Pokemon.

1168
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:50,960
Oh.

1169
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,660
Well, looks like it's my turn, fellas.

1170
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,000
Your turn.

1171
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,480
Where is he?

1172
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,260
Oh, he's over there.

1173
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,080
Oh, it's daytime.

1174
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,080
That's cheating.

1175
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,840
You get the sun to your advantage.

1176
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,440
I gotta find me an open field.

1177
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,880
Oh no!

1178
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,520
Don't let him get the open field.

1179
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,960
I hear you.

1180
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,380
Yeah, you do.

1181
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,080
In the bushes.

1182
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,160
Yeah, you definitely hear me in the bushes.

1183
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,460
I have an idea.

1184
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,180
You're still not in the open field.

1185
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,200
I'm trying.

1186
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,700
Oh, I know you're here.

1187
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,120
No, you don't.

1188
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,560
No, you don't.

1189
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,580
I know you're in when I hear the...

1190
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,100
I hear the timer.

1191
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,460
You hear the timer?

1192
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,720
Don't worry.

1193
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,920
There's bushes all around you.

1194
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,880
How did you see the force peeling?

1195
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,200
Yes, walk...

1196
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,840
I didn't see.

1197
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,580
I was like, where did he go?

1198
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,140
Also, it didn't reset.

1199
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,200
Oh, that was a bug on the other map.

1200
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,080
Early access.

1201
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,700
Early access.

1202
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,900
I mean, that's pretty good for an early access.

1203
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,380
You hear that?

1204
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,360
You hear that?

1205
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:07,820
You hear that?

1206
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,180
Oh, yeah, it works now.

1207
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,980
Yeah, that's right.

1208
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,600
You can't 360.

1209
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,920
They made it so much easier for you guys.

1210
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,060
They made it so much easier for you guys.

1211
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,220
You can't say that.

1212
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,680
Amelie fucked you up.

1213
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,140
You can't say that.

1214
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,680
Why can't you be more like Amelie?

1215
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
Why are you running?

1216
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,520
Why are you running?

1217
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,380
Why am I running?

1218
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:40,920
Why am I running?

1219
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,220
Oh, she reset!

1220
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,980
This is a dead line!

1221
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,220
No!

1222
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,860
Why me?

1223
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,460
I just got here.

1224
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,660
I tried this, motherfucker!

1225
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,500
Oh, no!

1226
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,080
We died too many times.

1227
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,780
It resets.

1228
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,020
Well, well, well.

1229
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,580
No, no.

1230
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,300
If it is the consequences of our own...

1231
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,180
Looks like I win this round.

1232
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,980
We can get it back up.

1233
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,400
You can.

1234
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,700
That's right.

1235
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,360
That's right.

1236
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,100
Try to shoot this.

1237
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,360
You can't leave this.

1238
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,560
I'm out of ammo.

1239
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,440
He's reloading!

1240
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,120
He's reloading!

1241
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,440
Out of ammo.

1242
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,360
We going for the kill.

1243
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,540
I'm a Halo player, not an Apex player!

1244
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,200
I'm a Halo player, not an Apex player!

1245
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,020
It's okay.

1246
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,020
He can't shoot the tree.

1247
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,200
Just like last time.

1248
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,660
Oh, no!

1249
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,960
For democracy.

1250
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,480
We're still in here.

1251
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,200
But you don't know where.

1252
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,500
Yeah, where could we be?

1253
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,220
I wonder.

1254
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,680
What?

1255
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:45,720
What?

1256
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,160
You're lucky I had to reload.

1257
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
Shall I find an issue?

1258
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:55,920
No!

1259
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,520
It's okay.

1260
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,220
For democracy, you son of a bitch.

1261
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,280
Tick tock.

1262
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,880
Yeah, you're still in here.

1263
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,600
It's like playing dodgeball.

1264
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,300
I've always been in here.

1265
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,680
If you can dodge a bullet, you can dodge a ball.

1266
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,120
What do I look like?

1267
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,760
Wait, don't shoot me.

1268
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,680
What the frick is happening to me?

1269
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,420
Oh my god, you look like a spider, dear.

1270
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,020
No!

1271
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,860
No!

1272
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,300
I said dodge!

1273
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,620
I'm sorry, I didn't hear the dodge.

1274
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,080
There were too many people yelling.

1275
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,380
No!

1276
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,500
It's a dumb bounce!

1277
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,760
I couldn't go anywhere.

1278
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,620
Whale.

1279
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,400
I can't believe it.

1280
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,840
Sy is exploiting.

1281
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,140
He's exploiting!

1282
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,740
Exploiting?

1283
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,680
Hey, don't blame me for the game making an invisible wall.

1284
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,700
Lions!

1285
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,540
Mons!

1286
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,320
This ain't democracy!

1287
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,680
You're right.

1288
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,900
This is a dictatorship.

1289
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,260
No.

1290
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,060
God damn.

1291
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,660
What are you looking at?

1292
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,400
What are you looking at?

1293
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,960
What are you looking at?

1294
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,880
Maybe that jump in the air over there.

1295
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,240
No!

1296
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,440
You can't catch me!

1297
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,120
I'm 360!

1298
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,020
Oh dear!

1299
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,380
I took you right...

1300
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:26,940
That's right!

1301
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,000
You right about me!

1302
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,600
Oh my god!

1303
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,440
I got one bullet left.

1304
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,960
One bullet left.

1305
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,200
No more bullets!

1306
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,660
Oh, I used to be alone!

1307
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,320
No!

1308
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,420
He has to cool down!

1309
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,680
Oh my god!

1310
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,580
What happened to my body?

1311
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,480
My body!

1312
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,340
The game said stop exploiting.

1313
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,660
No, it stopped working.

1314
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,000
The timer stopped working.

1315
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,380
He stopped going crazy.

1316
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,620
He's becoming sane.

1317
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,980
Oh no, he's going crazy again.

1318
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,040
That's good.

1319
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,900
Guys, we can't let him kill us.

1320
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,220
Oh my god!

1321
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,860
Put him against the tree!

1322
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,720
I'm stuck!

1323
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,180
I'm stuck!

1324
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,180
What was going on here?

1325
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,260
You'll never know.

1326
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,300
That's right!

1327
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,060
You're in the wrong territory!

1328
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,260
What happened to my body?

1329
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,700
I'm in the wrong negative woods now.

1330
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah, that's right.

1331
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,020
You're in the wrong territory!

1332
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,220
I was thinking right.

1333
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,460
Get out of here!

1334
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:30,760
What?

1335
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,400
Yes!

1336
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:32,960
Get him!

1337
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,740
You son of a bitch!

1338
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,820
I got one of you!

1339
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,780
Oh, you did it.

1340
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,480
Well, you missed!

1341
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,560
Yeah!

1342
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,660
That's for Bebi!

1343
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,660
I'm on the map!

1344
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,120
I'm on the map!

1345
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,400
I can feel!

1346
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,520
That's for Bebi!

1347
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,000
That's for Bebi!

1348
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,580
Chat, they're cheating!

1349
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,100
Chat, they're cheating!

1350
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,840
You literally won!

1351
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,080
I still won!

1352
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,020
I still won!

1353
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:03,800
No!

1354
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,640
Did I find out ping is a thing?

1355
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,020
Did I find out ping is a thing?

1356
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,440
On my end, I literally was under the map.

1357
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,720
I'm like, I still win!

1358
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,440
He like disappeared from me.

1359
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,440
I was like, where did he go?

1360
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,100
I think the night maps are the scariest.

1361
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:24,940
Oh, yeah.

1362
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,340
For sure.

1363
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,220
It's gonna make me the hunter.

1364
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,420
I wonder what the proximity chat sounds like.

1365
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,840
I wonder what the what?

1366
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,480
Huh?

1367
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,540
I don't like where I am.

1368
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,320
I wonder what the proximity chat sounds like.

1369
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,760
Like, is it just the deer running by?

1370
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:46,240
The funny thing is, it's like one of those things where I like looked and there's no way to pick what microphone to use in the game.

1371
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,040
Unless you have to do it.

1372
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,800
But specifically in your settings?

1373
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,980
I can't see anything!

1374
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,580
I can't see anything!

1375
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,040
I just hear the humps.

1376
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,460
Just hear me right beside you.

1377
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,440
Right beside you.

1378
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,920
Come on, Fru, be apex!

1379
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,800
Oh, we're right here.

1380
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,600
I can't with this high sense.

1381
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,060
Hey guys!

1382
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,080
Can you hear me?

1383
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,180
Oh my god, I'm flying off the map!

1384
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,140
I don't think you're near us.

1385
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,040
Are you near us, Sai?

1386
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,240
Hold on.

1387
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,040
I don't see you.

1388
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:16,900
Proximity chat?

1389
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,620
Proximity chat?

1390
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,100
Oh no, we don't hear you.

1391
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,180
I don't think you're near us.

1392
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,780
I'm right behind you.

1393
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,220
No, I don't hear you.

1394
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,640
Well, proximity chat is a lie.

1395
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,720
So, next update.

1396
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,260
Don't worry.

1397
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,740
Actually, add proximity chat.

1398
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,740
We're the early pioneers.

1399
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,800
Where'd Fruit go?

1400
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:37,940
On me.

1401
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,760
My aim is broken, guys!

1402
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,360
It's broken!

1403
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:44,880
It's broken!

1404
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,340
I broke the game!

1405
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,060
I broke the game!

1406
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,280
I broke the game!

1407
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,520
It happened to me.

1408
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,480
Just zoom in and out.

1409
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,340
Oh, this is so trippy!

1410
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:54,560
No!

1411
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,600
I hit the tree!

1412
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,340
My tree!

1413
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,040
Apex!

1414
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:01,660
Apex.

1415
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,320
I literally broke the game!

1416
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,660
Yo, she broke the game!

1417
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,680
There's a chance for us!

1418
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,700
There's a chance!

1419
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,660
Spawning at the edge of the fucking map!

1420
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,400
I can't... I can't like ADS anymore.

1421
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,160
You can't ADS!

1422
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:18,820
No!

1423
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,200
It's broken!

1424
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:21,840
No!

1425
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,360
What?

1426
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,940
The water is so loud.

1427
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,420
That's why we need to take her to the water.

1428
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,980
It's our only chance.

1429
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,660
We need to take her to the water.

1430
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,540
Push her to the water.

1431
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,720
Fruit, you know where you wanna go.

1432
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,480
Come on, Fruit.

1433
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,340
Go to the water.

1434
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,680
Fruit, come on!

1435
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,260
Go to the tall grass.

1436
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,960
Hey guys, hey guys!

1437
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,820
Go to the tall... to your left.

1438
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,440
I don't know how to swim.

1439
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,040
Come on, Fruit!

1440
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,020
This way, follow us, Fruit!

1441
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,180
I don't know how to swim.

1442
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,900
I don't know how to swim.

1443
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,700
If you wanna be a full frog, you have to go to the water!

1444
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,640
Oh, that's true.

1445
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:03,800
That is true.

1446
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,060
Fruit, it's right here.

1447
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,380
It's calling your name, Fruit.

1448
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,820
Just like the rainbow connection.

1449
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,280
Oh shit.

1450
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,740
You're almost there, Fruit!

1451
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,640
I can't shoot you even if I wanted to because I cut ADS.

1452
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,420
Into the water!

1453
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,620
Into the water!

1454
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,820
Why do I keep breaking my game?

1455
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,540
Just head straight down!

1456
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,260
To your left!

1457
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,040
Fruit, to your left!

1458
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,440
You're going away from the water!

1459
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,620
I can't see anything.

1460
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,880
You're going away from the water!

1461
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,600
Have you tried pressing F?

1462
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,060
YES!

1463
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:37,820
It's worse!

1464
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:38,560
It's worse?

1465
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:41,620
YES!

1466
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,040
Try...

1467
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,840
What worked for me was zooming in and out.

1468
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,360
Like using the scope again.

1469
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,620
I was like, what's in this bush?

1470
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,760
And I just see like a huge...

1471
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,620
Okay,

1472
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,300
we'll put you out of your misery.

1473
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,380
I'm like a million miles away.

1474
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:06,920
I am.

1475
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,800
I like being a million miles away.

1476
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,640
Some maps are tiny as fuck.

1477
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,760
And then this one is like 200 miles away from the honey.

1478
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,260
Like what?

1479
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,060
Hunty?

1480
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,020
Hunty?

1481
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,540
Hunty?

1482
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,320
She's got that aim.

1483
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,100
Hunty?

1484
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,200
At Apex Legends.

1485
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,640
You're going in an open field?

1486
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,880
What is this?

1487
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,580
What is this?

1488
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,440
You're in the fucking corner!

1489
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,260
I just hear the shots.

1490
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,440
I'm like 200 meters away.

1491
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,600
I'm within all these bushes.

1492
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:46,960
I'm gonna run!

1493
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,000
Which is the right bush?

1494
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,420
Whoa!

1495
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,500
Fruit, what are you doing?

1496
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,180
I don't know.

1497
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,800
Fruit is so paranoid right now.

1498
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,900
I'm so scared!

1499
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:58,420
I'm so scared!

1500
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,240
Hey, how's it going pal?

1501
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:02,860
Hey.

1502
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,580
How's it going pal?

1503
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,060
Wait, I'm stuck!

1504
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,960
Oh my god, my W key doesn't work!

1505
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,640
She's stuck!

1506
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,360
We got this!

1507
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,820
I didn't even do anything!

1508
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,060
Hey, I don't need a W key to shoot.

1509
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,980
Damn, that's crazy.

1510
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,820
I was just watching your back.

1511
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,980
And this is the thanks I get.

1512
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,420
I'm gonna reload.

1513
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,340
You're jumping in so funny.

1514
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,800
You're jumping in the funniest looking thing.

1515
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,560
Come on, Fruit.

1516
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,720
This is not like you, Fruit.

1517
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,960
You wouldn't kill a deer, would ya?

1518
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,620
You wouldn't kill a deer with glasses, would ya?

1519
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,200
You wouldn't download a deer, would ya?

1520
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:48,320
You wouldn't download a deer, would ya?

1521
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,000
Oh my god, my gear!

1522
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,320
Wait, I died and my scope is perma- I'm perma-sculpted.

1523
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,400
Wait, is she perma-sculpted?

1524
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:54,940
No!

1525
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,500
We're so close!

1526
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,900
We're so close!

1527
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,300
The sense is alive!

1528
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,000
That's actually right.

1529
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,860
She doesn't know.

1530
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,320
Oh wait.

1531
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,460
She doesn't know.

1532
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,940
Oh no, don't walk away from the bushes.

1533
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,680
Come on.

1534
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,700
Fruit doesn't know.

1535
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,300
You don't know.

1536
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:12,760
I don't know.

1537
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,360
Come on, we're just- Wait, I don't.

1538
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,160
I'm stupid.

1539
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,840
We're just shooting.

1540
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,320
No!

1541
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,980
Every time we get close, she shames us!

1542
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:31,800
That's right.

1543
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,620
That's like you're right.

1544
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,840
Back into the bushes I go.

1545
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,080
No!

1546
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,920
Wait, I found them!

1547
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,520
The closest we got was getting Amelie crazy.

1548
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,980
That's the closest we ever got.

1549
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:45,880
No!

1550
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,140
No!

1551
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,980
Will I ever get to be the hunter?

1552
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,800
Have you even been a hunter yet?

1553
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,100
No, I've been zero times!

1554
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,460
I've never gotten a chance to be a hunter!

1555
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,460
Doki, it really hates you.

1556
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,380
Can the host not be the hunter?

1557
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,140
I don't know.

1558
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:03,620
Maybe.

1559
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,820
Maybe that's why.

1560
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,100
That would make a lot of sense.

1561
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,160
I say as I'm the hunter.

1562
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,280
I'm the hunter now.

1563
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:10,940
Alright fellas.

1564
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,920
Time to bully the shit out of Doki Bird.

1565
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,440
Let's go.

1566
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,760
Oh my god, bro.

1567
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,700
The flashlight fucking sucks.

1568
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,580
What the fuck?

1569
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,080
It's so bad!

1570
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,340
It's so bright!

1571
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,680
Hey, deer in headlights?

1572
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,160
What?

1573
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,620
Wait, wait, wait.

1574
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1575
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,620
I understand now.

1576
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,000
I understand now.

1577
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,380
I understand now.

1578
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:37,940
I understand now.

1579
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,340
Please!

1580
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,870
I'm sorry for bullying all deers before.

1581
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,640
Oh no.

1582
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,220
This is for my cousin Bambi!

1583
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,140
Join Bambi in heaven!

1584
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,440
Wow, thanks.

1585
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,220
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

1586
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,800
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

1587
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,000
Gotta be alone.

1588
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:01,700
Gotta be alone.

1589
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,740
Oh my god, now I know.

1590
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,220
Now I know.

1591
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:07,840
Oh my god.

1592
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,020
It's like a fucking flashbang every time.

1593
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,440
Oh, there's so many of you.

1594
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,440
Oh my god, you should see how funny the 360 jumping is.

1595
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:15,840
No!

1596
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,440
Oh, just...

1597
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,920
Oh god, where's the other deer?

1598
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,080
Why are you jumping?

1599
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,280
Jumping at a deer?

1600
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,320
If I jump, maybe you won't clip my hip box.

1601
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,240
If I jump, maybe you won't clip my hip box.

1602
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,700
Hold the sword!

1603
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,320
Oh my god.

1604
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,020
Oh my god.

1605
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,060
Oh my god.

1606
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,140
I keep moving.

1607
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,580
They won't know.

1608
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,460
I see you in the bushes.

1609
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,620
I know you're in the bushes!

1610
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,020
We're always in the bushes.

1611
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,380
We're always in the bushes.

1612
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,900
I know what to do.

1613
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,580
Into the water I go!

1614
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,920
That's hacking right!

1615
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,620
I see you in there.

1616
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,380
You're in that bush!

1617
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,800
I'm strafing!

1618
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,480
I'm strafing!

1619
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,440
She's tap strafing!

1620
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,640
That's hacking right.

1621
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,380
I have aim assist.

1622
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,000
I know you're near me.

1623
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,120
Behind you.

1624
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:14,820
Oh, Doki.

1625
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,340
Behind you, Doki.

1626
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,700
No, no, no, no, no!

1627
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,960
You're not in my circle!

1628
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,120
You're not in my circle!

1629
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,100
Maybe I'm in that bush right next to you.

1630
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,520
There's a bush next to me?

1631
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,500
There's no bushes next to me.

1632
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,020
You're in an open field, you chicken!

1633
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,100
That's hacking right.

1634
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:33,700
No!

1635
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,180
Yes!

1636
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,560
Oh god, oh god, oh god!

1637
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,360
I said behind you.

1638
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,240
I'm flogging, I'm flogging.

1639
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,220
No, no, no, no.

1640
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:47,860
There's too many trees.

1641
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,500
We're in the trees.

1642
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,340
We're in the trees.

1643
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,840
We're in the trees.

1644
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,340
Looking good, Doki.

1645
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,300
Oh god, oh god.

1646
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,060
Where are you?

1647
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:04,960
Where are you?

1648
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,100
I can't go!

1649
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,020
Has the paranoia settled in yet?

1650
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,500
It's okay.

1651
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,420
It's okay.

1652
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,180
One of you will go down.

1653
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,960
As long as I bring one of you down.

1654
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,720
Yes!

1655
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,120
Run, run.

1656
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,920
Where are you running?

1657
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,180
Away from you.

1658
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,820
I see you, I see you right there.

1659
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,880
I see you to my left.

1660
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,160
You think I don't see you?

1661
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,080
Now you're to my right.

1662
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,580
You think I don't see you?

1663
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,680
Are you sure that's me?

1664
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,580
I'm pretty sure I killed the other two.

1665
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,820
You're the only dear left in the world.

1666
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,060
I'll make sure you all go extinct.

1667
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:40,340
Really?

1668
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,120
Cause I'm the one right in front of you.

1669
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,520
Oh, you're serpentine-ing.

1670
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,120
I see you serpentine-ing right now.

1671
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:45,960
That's right!

1672
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:46,680
Serpentine!

1673
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,000
Serpentine!

1674
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,040
I told you, you weren't alone.

1675
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,040
I warned you.

1676
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,700
You know what?

1677
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,300
I'm gonna do a 360 no-scope.

1678
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,940
Where did you come from?

1679
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:06,860
No!

1680
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:07,680
Woah!

1681
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,660
Did I hit anybody?

1682
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:12,940
I

1683
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,420
didn't get to play.

1684
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,180
Oh!

1685
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,160
Okay.

1686
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,720
Reload, reload, reload, reload, reload, reload!

1687
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,160
Yes!

1688
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:31,880
Okay.

1689
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,040
You can do this, fellas.

1690
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,280
Oh my god!

1691
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,700
My couple's got you!

1692
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,820
Serpentine motion!

1693
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,460
Serpentine!

1694
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,360
There's so many serpentines!

1695
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,540
Give me a lot!

1696
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,360
There's a lot of bullets firing.

1697
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,160
Fuck em up!

1698
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:51,680
Fuck em up!

1699
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,380
Oh my god!

1700
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,320
Oh my god!

1701
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,240
Oh my god!

1702
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:01,580
Please!

1703
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,300
Just bob and weave, boys.

1704
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,900
Just bob and weave, boys.

1705
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,400
Oh god.

1706
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:09,740
Oh no!

1707
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,640
I'm so far away.

1708
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,680
Wait, who left?

1709
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,000
What happened?

1710
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,060
There I go.

1711
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:18,880
There I go.

1712
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,540
You all went way too quiet for this game.

1713
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,020
Everyone just stopped laughing.

1714
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,580
Okay.

1715
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,040
Oh, I see you.

1716
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,040
I see you.

1717
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,320
You can't run that fast.

1718
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:29,940
Just maneuver.

1719
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,880
Oh, the bobber!

1720
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,160
Oh, fuck!

1721
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:35,880
Hello!

1722
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,240
Leave me alone!

1723
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,540
This is just our hobby!

1724
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,460
Oh my god!

1725
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,680
Leave me alone!

1726
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,460
There's a new cow tipping!

1727
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,220
Oh shit.

1728
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,120
You have like a mastiff.

1729
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:48,680
Fuck!

1730
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,100
I always miss the one deer.

1731
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,860
I get two.

1732
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,260
Two is my limit.

1733
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,060
Fellas, I don't think we're gonna be able to do it.

1734
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,060
Yeah, that's true.

1735
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,760
You guys, if we're not being stealthy, that's for sure.

1736
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,120
Alright, let's bully the fuck out of them.

1737
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:07,180
No!

1738
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:08,600
Please!

1739
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,420
I'm just doing this for a hobby!

1740
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,500
We're gonna be so dumb!

1741
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,260
Yeah!

1742
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,840
That's making me right.

1743
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,140
Dear Hunter Superior.

1744
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,580
Alright, let's do the next game mode.

1745
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,360
This is the next one.

1746
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,120
Alright, alright, alright.

1747
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,720
Now that you said I've never been Hunter, watch you be Hunter like ten times in a row.

1748
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,460
What's gonna happen?

1749
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,700
Oh no!

1750
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,520
Hit and run.

1751
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,160
Connection failed.

1752
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,240
Yeah, I was the host.

1753
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,280
Switch game one.

1754
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,320
Who wants to be the host?

1755
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,620
Oh wait!

1756
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,540
Let's see.

1757
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:47,380
Let's have Fruit be the host and see what it's like on EU ping.

1758
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,480
On EU ping?

1759
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:49,980
Really?

1760
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,420
Really?

1761
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,380
EU ping?

1762
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:53,760
Let me see.

1763
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,800
This will go swimmingly.

1764
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:57,920
Oh no.

1765
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,940
Have mercy.

1766
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,380
It's okay.

1767
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,060
As long as we're not Hunter, you'll be fine.

1768
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,160
Oh god.

1769
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,040
No, the 200 ping.

1770
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,200
200 ping on EU servers?

1771
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:11,720
Nah.

1772
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,860
There is a single player.

1773
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,760
There is a single player mode by the way.

1774
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,520
How the fuck is there a single player mode?

1775
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,380
The deers are the NPCs.

1776
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,420
They're all imposters.

1777
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,440
Are they all NPCs?

1778
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:19,860
Yeah.

1779
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,620
It's like deer hunt.

1780
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,140
You can't trust nobody.

1781
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,180
Wait, I said...

1782
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,480
Oh, I got it.

1783
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,280
Sayu?

1784
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,600
Sayu?

1785
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:30,760
Yes?

1786
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,540
Oh, wait, wait.

1787
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,040
Can we add?

1788
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,040
Maybe we can add them to the party.

1789
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:36,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1790
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:36,840
We can.

1791
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,200
Oh, nice, nice.

1792
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:38,680
Okay, okay.

1793
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1794
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,580
Okay, well I confirm for future.

1795
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,040
This is a great game.

1796
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:45,560
Good job.

1797
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,240
Yeah.

1798
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,160
Add more game modes.

1799
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,260
Give us more setting options, please.

1800
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:52,600
I know.

1801
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,600
More game modes.

1802
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,160
What if there was like a back room?

1803
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,400
It's deers but the back room.

1804
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,600
Party leader matchmaking.

1805
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,400
Oh, matchmaking?

1806
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,100
Oh, wait.

1807
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,300
You're supposed to do create match.

1808
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,220
Oh.

1809
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:07,960
Yeah.

1810
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,060
Yeah, they invite us again.

1811
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,980
I love how there's deer emotes.

1812
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,180
I can't wait for the cosmetics.

1813
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,180
There's deer emotes?

1814
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

1815
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,140
One, two, and three.

1816
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:21,580
Wait, really?

1817
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,720
Was that how you guys were shaking your booties?

1818
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,440
Yeah.

1819
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,160
That's how you shake the booty.

1820
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,560
Eat the grass.

1821
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,640
Alright.

1822
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:35,640
I'm in.

1823
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,680
Hit it red.

1824
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,220
Let's go.

1825
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:39,580
Let me in.

1826
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,340
Get in here.

1827
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,060
The good old banjo.

1828
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,400
Yup.

1829
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,520
Yup.

1830
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,260
Let's do this.

1831
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,860
I can't wait to put deer ready up.

1832
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,100
I can't wait to put our little hats on.

1833
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,800
I'm ready for democracy.

1834
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:58,900
Deer-mocracy.

1835
00:59:58,980 --> 00:59:59,560
Let's go.

1836
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:01,920
Who's high?

1837
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,280
Who's high?

1838
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,180
We're going to school.

1839
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,020
High school for deers.

1840
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:09,780
So...

1841
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,740
Oh, brother.

1842
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,940
Hit and run.

1843
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,380
Is this like DVD?

1844
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,940
Is there an inside and outside?

1845
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,120
Oh, I wonder.

1846
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,240
I'm eating the grass right now.

1847
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,840
You don't know where I'm...

1848
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,200
I'm in this court, you say.

1849
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,820
So we have to stay outside of the bubble, but we have to hit...

1850
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,680
the hunter.

1851
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,460
Wait, it's just us.

1852
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,220
I just realized it's just us.

1853
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,480
That's right.

1854
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,640
Finish him!

1855
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,560
Oh, what the fuck?

1856
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,820
Where is he?

1857
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,840
Oh my gosh, he's so low!

1858
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,900
There's like a little boss.

1859
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:48,840
Oh, yeah.

1860
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:49,960
Oh, that's right.

1861
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:50,840
Yes!

1862
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,160
Stay inside the bear!

1863
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,240
That's right!

1864
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,900
Oh, he gets less!

1865
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,300
We just had it!

1866
01:00:58,780 --> 01:00:59,260
No!

1867
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:01,720
That's right.

1868
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,200
You don't know where I'm...

1869
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,060
You don't know where I'm...

1870
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,200
You don't know where I'm...

1871
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,020
Don't skin me, please!

1872
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,320
You don't know where I'm...

1873
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,100
No, I'm getting skinned!

1874
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,100
But escape!

1875
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,680
We have to escape the boundary!

1876
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,840
Oh my god, you just kicked someone!

1877
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,960
Alright, I'm out, I'm out!

1878
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,620
I got the point, I got the point!

1879
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:21,900
Nice, nice.

1880
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,980
I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck!

1881
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:24,800
I'm stuck!

1882
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:28,880
Wait...

1883
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:30,800
Ow!

1884
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,620
Who is he?

1885
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,000
Oh my god!

1886
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,740
What happened?

1887
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,760
Oh my god!

1888
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,960
Oh, do we have to stay in the bubble?

1889
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:39,920
Oh...

1890
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,160
No, he killed all of us!

1891
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,900
No, he double tapped!

1892
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,860
He double tapped me!

1893
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,360
And now I'm gonna skin you!

1894
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,360
Ow!

1895
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,580
What the fuck, dude?

1896
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,900
What the fuck?

1897
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,320
No!

1898
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,800
Good thing I blend in with the ground.

1899
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:00,600
Oh shit!

1900
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,420
He like...

1901
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,740
I'm sorry, we have to stay in for the point!

1902
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,160
We have to stay in!

1903
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,600
Nice!

1904
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:07,880
Escape!

1905
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,600
We have to escape!

1906
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,660
No, no, we have to stay... No!

1907
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,520
We lost the point!

1908
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,480
Oh, we got the point, nice, nice, nice.

1909
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,720
I'm scared.

1910
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,260
I see you, I see you!

1911
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:20,820
Yes!

1912
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:22,720
Save me!

1913
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,260
I see you looking this way!

1914
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,400
That's right, you can't...

1915
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,220
I can't see!

1916
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,060
I notice you can't shoot me when I'm 360!

1917
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,200
Don't skin me!

1918
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,240
Don't skin me!

1919
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,040
That's a good...

1920
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:39,800
No...

1921
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,200
I'm gonna skin you out here!

1922
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,620
Got it!

1923
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:45,960
Got point, got point!

1924
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,180
If you'll excuse me, I'm skinning my brain.

1925
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:51,620
No!

1926
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,980
If you'll excuse me, I'm trying to skin my...

1927
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:54,780
No, no, no!

1928
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,080
I'm trying to skin my brain!

1929
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,740
I'm trying to skin my brain!

1930
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:00,960
You're never gonna skin her!

1931
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,360
I did it.

1932
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,300
No!

1933
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,460
Run down!

1934
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,880
Don't let him skin me!

1935
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,120
I'mma skin you!

1936
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,520
Don't let him skin me!

1937
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,160
No!

1938
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,880
Don't let him do it!

1939
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,400
My skin is worth so much money!

1940
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:17,300
I'm done.

1941
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:24,620
I was like, what are you doing?

1942
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,120
You can see me?

1943
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,080
You can see me now?

1944
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:28,520
No!

1945
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,080
I just...

1946
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,840
Frank, you let it do me!

1947
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,340
Give me your flesh!

1948
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,260
We gotta fight, we gotta fight, we gotta fight!

1949
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,040
We gotta fight!

1950
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,280
I'm skinned!

1951
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,760
Can you see the beer?

1952
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,420
Through walls?

1953
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:43,660
No!

1954
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:45,920
No!

1955
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,140
Where is he?

1956
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:50,940
Where is he?

1957
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,120
He's over there.

1958
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,380
I'm a pot car.

1959
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:56,860
I'm a pot car.

1960
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,520
How the fuck?

1961
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,580
That's right, I was always behind you!

1962
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:04,380
Wow!

1963
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,240
You're lucky I'm a bad shot!

1964
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,140
You guys are lucky I'm a shit shot!

1965
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,620
I'm glad I'm not the hunted.

1966
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,640
I just got up, baby.

1967
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,900
Yeah, that's right.

1968
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:22,160
You're gonna let yourself get bullied by a herd of deer.

1969
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,460
Wait, if you hold space...

1970
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,620
Oh my god, I didn't realize.

1971
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:26,840
Hey.

1972
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,260
Hey.

1973
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,000
Oh, that's right!

1974
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,300
You let that 360 spin fucking try!

1975
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,160
He let me have this one.

1976
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:36,660
Oh no!

1977
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,420
Don't let him see you!

1978
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,040
I'm a skater!

1979
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:39,600
No!

1980
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,500
Not my foot!

1981
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,740
I can't see you anymore!

1982
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,480
I'm trying to skin you but it won't let me!

1983
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,240
That's looking right...

1984
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,880
Holy shit!

1985
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,560
I look horrific!

1986
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,420
What the hell?

1987
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:55,800
Don't worry guys, another point.

1988
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:58,060
I realized...

1989
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,060
I realized...

1990
01:04:59,060 --> 01:04:59,100
I realized...

1991
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,660
I got shot.

1992
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,480
Oh, I'm reloading alright.

1993
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,620
Where am I going?

1994
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,620
The game is broken, hello?

1995
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,020
What's going on?

1996
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,220
The game looks like...

1997
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,160
The skin looks really graphic.

1998
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,700
It's okay, I'm right with you.

1999
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:17,180
E!

2000
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:17,900
E!

2001
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,620
You can't E anymore!

2002
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:22,820
Okay...

2003
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:23,580
No!

2004
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,040
So close!

2005
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,580
He got a triple!

2006
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,340
We're winning though!

2007
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,740
He can't skin us all!

2008
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,920
He can't skin us all in time!

2009
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:34,840
Why are we spawning one?

2010
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:35,900
He missed out!

2011
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,300
He missed out on my skin!

2012
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,880
Excuse me, I'm trying to skin my catch.

2013
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,220
No, you aren't!

2014
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,580
No skinning your catch here!

2015
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,520
Now you don't know where I am.

2016
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:51,840
I think.

2017
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,120
I can't move my camera but I think.

2018
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:54,640
He's gonna open!

2019
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,580
He's gonna open!

2020
01:05:59,360 --> 01:05:59,940
That's right.

2021
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,260
You don't know.

2022
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,440
I'm in the bushes.

2023
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,420
I'm a bushman.

2024
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:06,620
Get off me!

2025
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:07,460
Oh shit!

2026
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,860
Wait, can we not knock you over when the thing is up?

2027
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,640
I think if you only knocked him once, you can't do it again.

2028
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,340
That's right!

2029
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:15,760
Oh my god!

2030
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,200
He did it!

2031
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,960
Wait, he skinned me and then it ran away?

2032
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:32,460
Wait, you skinned the wrong one and skinned the one alive one but you still skinned the one alive one?

2033
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,060
You skinned me!

2034
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,600
Oh my god!

2035
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,920
I'm so fucked up!

2036
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,820
I'm so fucked up!

2037
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,120
This game dog.

2038
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,880
He just skinned the closest to you.

2039
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,260
Oh my god!

2040
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,460
My true form.

2041
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,100
Where is he?

2042
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,980
Where could the hunter be?

2043
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,260
Where could the hunter be?

2044
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,940
Who could it be?

2045
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,440
Who could it be?

2046
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,320
Who could it be?

2047
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,280
Get away, Prue!

2048
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,660
Aren't you having a great time, Prue?

2049
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:07,900
Aren't you having a great time, Prue?

2050
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,820
You can't hide from that tree!

2051
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,740
You can't hide from that tree!

2052
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,760
Yeah, that's right!

2053
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,800
Wait, this tree is back.

2054
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,920
Oh shit!

2055
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:18,920
Don't let her near me.

2056
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:20,140
She doesn't know where I am.

2057
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:21,700
Where my body is!

2058
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:22,700
Guys!

2059
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,140
No!

2060
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,680
It double-tacked me!

2061
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,260
Don't eat my body!

2062
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,300
She's not getting near my body.

2063
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:31,060
She can't get the point.

2064
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:31,580
I'm trying to get that point, fellas.

2065
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,100
Don't let her get that point.

2066
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,100
Don't let her get close to me.

2067
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:34,820
Don't let her touch me!

2068
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,620
Don't let her touch me!

2069
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,600
Zero point for you.

2070
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,020
Yeah, you better run.

2071
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,960
You better run!

2072
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,600
I was so fast.

2073
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:49,760
Yeah, you!

2074
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:51,940
Oh my god!

2075
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,200
I was scared to live in Cripple Bay!

2076
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,500
I was on your ass for a good five minutes.

2077
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:58,320
Oh...

2078
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,240
Oh...

2079
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:00,640
That's right!

2080
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,000
Yes!

2081
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,400
That's right.

2082
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,040
You can't shoot...

2083
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,540
Come on, try to shoot me here.

2084
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,900
Oh my god!

2085
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:08,440
That's right!

2086
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,400
Try to shoot me, Prue.

2087
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:12,720
Come on!

2088
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:13,560
360!

2089
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,900
Oh, that's a lot of wasted ammo there.

2090
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,860
I know I lost!

2091
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,360
That's a lot of wasted ammo!

2092
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:27,780
Oh!

2093
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:27,920
Shit!

2094
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,200
Guys, don't let her touch me!

2095
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,060
Guys, please!

2096
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:34,880
Don't let her touch me!

2097
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,080
Don't let her give me a lot of...

2098
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:38,180
No!

2099
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,360
My skin!

2100
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,100
My beautiful skin!

2101
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,200
My flesh!

2102
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,080
The bubble is...

2103
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,580
Oh, look at this!

2104
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:51,020
I'm not gonna go in there.

2105
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:55,600
So you gotta like, hit the hunter, stay inside the circle, and then leave.

2106
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,880
And then you gotta stay in the boundary, and then after...

2107
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,320
Oh shit!

2108
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,640
You guys traded!

2109
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,120
Yeah, you have to like...

2110
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,360
Make sure you kill the deer that hit you.

2111
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,800
So they can't get the point.

2112
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,600
I can't see anything!

2113
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:10,700
That's good.

2114
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,620
I thought we were like, nice!

2115
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,640
More points for us!

2116
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,120
Did you know that as a deer, there's a suicide button?

2117
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,200
Yes!

2118
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,560
Wait, what is this?

2119
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,760
Oh wait, there's a bugged deer right here!

2120
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,880
No, no, there's no deer!

2121
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:29,740
It's me!

2122
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:30,800
It was me!

2123
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,460
I missed my open meadow!

2124
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,540
I'm gonna go home!

2125
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,240
I'm gonna go home!

2126
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,080
No, don't worry, I'm gonna show you home.

2127
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,720
I'm gonna go home!

2128
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:44,480
Blackfruit!

2129
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,160
We know you're here!

2130
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,360
Blackfruit!

2131
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,700
The moment you get up, you're gonna get shot again!

2132
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,180
The moment you get up, you're gonna get shot again!

2133
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:53,860
Into the bushes I thought.

2134
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,580
Wait, oh no, my ADS broke again!

2135
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,120
It's perfect again!

2136
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,600
That's right, good.

2137
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,680
You shouldn't have told us that.

2138
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,160
Free points for us!

2139
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,300
Free points for us!

2140
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,480
Where are you, sons of bitches?

2141
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,020
Oh no, where are we?

2142
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:11,340
I smell you!

2143
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,920
I smell you!

2144
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,760
I got another point!

2145
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,060
You're not my ADS, don't worry!

2146
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,660
You don't need it, Fruit!

2147
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,040
I need it!

2148
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,420
I need it!

2149
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,600
I need it!

2150
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:26,460
I need it!

2151
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,720
I don't smell shit!

2152
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,700
It doesn't work, it doesn't work!

2153
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,320
You're better than this!

2154
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,480
Come on, you only got three of us!

2155
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,380
Come on, Fruit!

2156
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:39,740
My head is sticking out!

2157
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,220
Well, my head is not sticking out anymore.

2158
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,880
Dude, Fruit, in the last one you literally walked over my body like twice.

2159
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,040
Dude, Fruit, in the last one you literally walked over my body like twice.

2160
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,320
Whoa!

2161
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,260
Whoa!

2162
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,860
Will you get back at me?

2163
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,180
It's real, it's real!

2164
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,720
I got an ADS!

2165
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,980
No, he can see that!

2166
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,920
My butt popped out of the bush!

2167
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,360
No, please!

2168
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,880
Don't let it get me, guys!

2169
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,320
Don't let it touch my skin!

2170
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,860
It bit my skin!

2171
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,060
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm trying to get his points.

2172
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,120
Wait, how many points did you get, huh?

2173
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,520
Huh, Sy?

2174
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,040
How many points?

2175
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,860
I'm pretty sure like four or five.

2176
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,560
Get back here!

2177
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,260
And I'm about to get us another!

2178
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:25,120
You're welcome!

2179
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,660
You son of a bitch!

2180
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,460
That was my friend!

2181
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:32,300
Don't worry!

2182
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,200
Get the other bushes!

2183
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,700
Don't let it double tap!

2184
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,440
I got you!

2185
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,500
No audio!

2186
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:42,600
Man, that sure sucks!

2187
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,360
Your skin got ripped off!

2188
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:45,100
Man, that sure sucks!

2189
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:45,780
That's crazy!

2190
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,720
I'm so crazy!

2191
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,040
I can't do anything about your skin!

2192
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,360
No!

2193
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,020
Man, your skin fell off!

2194
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,280
That shit's wild!

2195
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,340
Oh my god!

2196
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,720
Don't double tap!

2197
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,320
You could say it was buck wild!

2198
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,580
Why the fuck did I do that?

2199
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:03,820
Who let this guy in here?

2200
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,140
I'm hearing stuff!

2201
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:07,300
Hey, what's good, fellas?

2202
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,920
Head on my knee, I'm just gonna...

2203
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,100
I'm just gonna be right here.

2204
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,040
Shit!

2205
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,100
Guys, I think we're losing our touch, guys.

2206
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:17,920
She's getting better.

2207
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,400
She's improving!

2208
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,080
She's getting better!

2209
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,760
Oh my god!

2210
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:25,640
She's adapting!

2211
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,380
Apparently, my last point didn't count.

2212
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,080
I just wanna let me know.

2213
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:30,820
She's adapting!

2214
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,260
She's gaming!

2215
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,680
She's using Apex!

2216
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,240
I am so close!

2217
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:39,940
Oh my god!

2218
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,840
I'm hip firing the whole time!

2219
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,460
I'm keeping her!

2220
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,500
I can respawn and she won't get my skin!

2221
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,000
I got it!

2222
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,620
She got my skin.

2223
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:51,500
Oh shit!

2224
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,260
My ankles!

2225
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,740
Top 10 fruit noises.

2226
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:54,540
Here we go.

2227
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,760
We did it!

2228
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,800
We won!

2229
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,040
I could have been peeled off, but I won!

2230
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,460
That was so close!

2231
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,840
You can't catch us off!

2232
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,400
I figured out the game too late!

2233
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:14,760
You can just jump over my head!

2234
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,980
That's the strat!

2235
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,720
Oh no!

2236
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,920
Not the night map!

2237
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:21,900
Oh brother!

2238
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:21,900
Not at night!

2239
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,420
Not the night map!

2240
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,100
Not at night time!

2241
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:26,500
Please!

2242
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,360
I don't wanna be hunted!

2243
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,220
Oh thank god!

2244
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,020
Brother!

2245
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:30,140
It's me!

2246
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,540
Sucks to be you!

2247
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:35,280
Sucks to be you, Sy!

2248
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:36,420
Yeah!

2249
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,200
I'll help you and draw your vision beam!

2250
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:41,620
Where are you?

2251
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:41,980
I hear them!

2252
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,300
Oh that's it!

2253
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,720
How do you get the spot in the open?

2254
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:48,800
You have no son to help you now!

2255
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,740
I hit him!

2256
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,240
Why is your tea bag right in front of me?

2257
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:53,900
Oh shit!

2258
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,420
Where do you live?

2259
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:57,860
I got a little copy.

2260
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,020
You don't know I'm in the dark!

2261
01:13:59,100 --> 01:13:59,740
No he knows!

2262
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,300
Now let me skin you!

2263
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,460
Don't touch me!

2264
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:03,840
Please!

2265
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,920
It won't let me.

2266
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,480
Oh there we go.

2267
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,360
Look at my beautiful skin!

2268
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:13,340
I have a very long skin routine!

2269
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,660
You ruined it!

2270
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,580
Your beautiful coat!

2271
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,120
No!

2272
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,160
Your beautiful coat!

2273
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,740
I will avenge you!

2274
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,980
Will I make this make a pretty coat?

2275
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:23,900
Will I?

2276
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:26,920
Thanks for your flesh!

2277
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:28,260
That was so close!

2278
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,440
You almost saved me!

2279
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:30,820
Okay wait wait I see him.

2280
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,080
Don't worry I'm coming over.

2281
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,540
Guys we don't have any points!

2282
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,300
We gotta up our game!

2283
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:36,720
Get him!

2284
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,100
Get him!

2285
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:37,860
I got a single!

2286
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,580
Guys I got us some points but not for us.

2287
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,320
You tried!

2288
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:44,020
You tried!

2289
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,140
Get on the ground and let me skin you!

2290
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:47,680
No!

2291
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,440
I didn't get us the points.

2292
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,980
I got a single point.

2293
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,260
We did it!

2294
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,940
You're the clutch!

2295
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,420
You can't see shit!

2296
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,420
The blue does not help fellas.

2297
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:01,640
That's great.

2298
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,820
My zoom does not work anymore.

2299
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,500
That's right you got the fruit nerf.

2300
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:08,960
I sure did.

2301
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,100
Looks like we're no scoping everything.

2302
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:13,800
Gotta get higher and all.

2303
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,340
Nevermind my zoom works now.

2304
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,460
Oh my god where is he?

2305
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,520
We gotta beat him up!

2306
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:19,980
Beat him up!

2307
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,760
My camera doesn't work by the way so I need to...

2308
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,100
Get him boy!

2309
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,980
That jump shot!

2310
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,040
It's okay don't let him near me!

2311
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,200
Don't let him near me guys!

2312
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,100
Don't let him near me!

2313
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:32,920
Someone hit him!

2314
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:34,460
No!

2315
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,040
Yes!

2316
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:36,760
Get him!

2317
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,200
You sumbitch!

2318
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,960
We found him!

2319
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,000
Don't let him near me!

2320
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,180
Get him away from me!

2321
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,860
He's gonna do it!

2322
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:47,620
No!

2323
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,420
Get off of me!

2324
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,960
You bastards!

2325
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,320
I lived!

2326
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:58,580
I can't believe you fucking disgusting deer!

2327
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,040
We did it!

2328
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,040
That's right.

2329
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,660
Deer together strong!

2330
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,700
And this is some great age bullshit!

2331
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:10,320
Oh dear!

2332
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:10,560
Oh my!

2333
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,700
Okay guys I realized running straight on...

2334
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:17,740
was not the right idea.

2335
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,400
You gotta bob and weave!

2336
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,660
You gotta bob and weave!

2337
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,680
I didn't...

2338
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,620
You're a sumbitch!

2339
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,520
I didn't really...

2340
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,440
bob and weave.

2341
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:28,060
Guys I think this map might suck as a hundred.

2342
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:30,420
Wait really?

2343
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:30,640
Really?

2344
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,580
No way!

2345
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,940
The insta skin?

2346
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:37,900
Oh my god!

2347
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,940
The night map is bad for the hunter?

2348
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,560
No fucking way!

2349
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,540
Who would've thought?

2350
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,260
Who would've thought?

2351
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,520
Who would've thought?

2352
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,160
He missed!

2353
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,240
The bob and weave!

2354
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,140
The bob and weave is pissing me off!

2355
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,500
Bob and weave!

2356
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:57,840
That's it!

2357
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,820
That was actually fucking hilarious.

2358
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,120
What are you guys doing?

2359
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,220
It's upsetting me!

2360
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:07,700
Woo!

2361
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:07,940
Woo!

2362
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,620
There's no more stealth it's just bob and weave.

2363
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:12,560
Woo!

2364
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,740
I'm scared!

2365
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,740
I'm hungry!

2366
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,720
I just want my deer skin!

2367
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,580
You're at F4!

2368
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:20,200
Don't you have enough?

2369
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,280
Is F4 not enough for you?

2370
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,620
Get over there!

2371
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,400
No!

2372
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:26,940
Fruit!

2373
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,040
I'm not gonna lie, here's the weird thing.

2374
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,000
The body glitches so I don't even know where Fruit's body is.

2375
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,940
Yeah I can't move.

2376
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,040
Go!

2377
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,400
Get over here!

2378
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:41,020
Did you see me crouch back?

2379
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,500
Yeah!

2380
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,760
Yes I did!

2381
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,360
That's how he found you!

2382
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,220
I can't help you!

2383
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:48,660
I have to escape the battery!

2384
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,860
It's for the greater good!

2385
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,800
Oh if you hold space it's pretty pog.

2386
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,880
Give me your flesh.

2387
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:56,020
Boom!

2388
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:56,840
There you go!

2389
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,060
That's right!

2390
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,060
Bob and weave time!

2391
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,700
Bob and weave!

2392
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,200
Bob and weave!

2393
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,600
Where do I go?

2394
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:05,940
Oh my god!

2395
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,400
I gave you that point.

2396
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,300
I felt bad for you.

2397
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,980
My E button isn't working so...

2398
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,200
Wait that means the body is just somewhere else.

2399
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:17,940
No.

2400
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,680
It won't let me harvest!

2401
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,920
Is the body somewhere else?

2402
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,340
It's a skill issue.

2403
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,340
I think.

2404
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,800
This game might...

2405
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:31,140
This game might suck.

2406
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:37,120
Just because you're bad at the game doesn't mean the game sucks.

2407
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,320
Yeah!

2408
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:43,600
I'm pretty sure that's the definition of a game suck you guys.

2409
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:48,160
I think this game has been great so far.

2410
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,000
And I've been enjoying my time as a dick.

2411
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:51,800
Bob and weave!

2412
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,480
I just said I got stealth 100.

2413
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,480
Stealth 100.

2414
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:57,140
Yeah I see that.

2415
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,140
It's definitely user error.

2416
01:18:58,540 --> 01:18:59,880
I missed a point!

2417
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,540
We have to go back.

2418
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:03,960
That's right.

2419
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,560
Bro.

2420
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,820
I only have half a point.

2421
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,740
Not even anymore.

2422
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,440
I'm just shooting the button.

2423
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,440
I was watching Simon's all his shots in front of me.

2424
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,960
I'm not even zooming in anymore.

2425
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:22,820
I'm just doing it.

2426
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:23,780
No!

2427
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,560
Apex is looking kind of weird right now guys.

2428
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,580
This new season is smacking.

2429
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,800
I like fell through the map.

2430
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,980
You're not getting any skin.

2431
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:32,500
No!

2432
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:34,220
Yeah!

2433
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,760
I still got to shoot you.

2434
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,120
We did it!

2435
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,140
Yay!

2436
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,480
Yay!

2437
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:44,860
Yay!

2438
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,720
I'm saying a slot though.

2439
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,560
You want to do one more then posture one?

2440
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,440
I think that one was a fun game.

2441
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,380
I'm so happy.

2442
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,120
I got to hear my favorite fruit noise.

2443
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:56,640
Which is...

2444
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,560
Are you?

2445
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:00,060
Are you?

2446
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,180
Who's making that lobby?

2447
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,480
Who's making the lobby for...

2448
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:08,300
For imposter.

2449
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:09,480
Someone else.

2450
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,480
Someone else.

2451
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:11,000
I can do.

2452
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,520
I can do.

2453
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,560
Create match?

2454
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,180
Yeah.

2455
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,320
Wait a second.

2456
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,260
I think I fucked up.

2457
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:19,500
Wait.

2458
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,220
Invite friends.

2459
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,700
You got this.

2460
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,220
She's got this.

2461
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,280
I'm my own teleport.

2462
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,940
Half mercy daddy invited me to some bullshit.

2463
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:35,500
Wait.

2464
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,540
Hit and run was not right.

2465
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:37,600
It's the...

2466
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:38,740
Sorry.

2467
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:40,580
You're learning.

2468
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,160
Hit and run.

2469
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,160
Imposter.

2470
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:45,860
I got it.

2471
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:47,980
Don't worry.

2472
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,880
That one is so fun.

2473
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,540
This one you can use emotes.

2474
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:56,900
I'm in.

2475
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,480
I got this gamers.

2476
01:20:58,660 --> 01:20:59,080
Don't worry.

2477
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,940
I tried at the end but then they fucked up.

2478
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:03,700
I'm in.

2479
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:04,740
On the first one.

2480
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,920
I'm more important than all of you because I'm the first one.

2481
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:08,360
I got it.

2482
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,660
First is the worst actually.

2483
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,020
Second and third are better.

2484
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,540
My antlers are better.

2485
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,600
Yours are bigger than yours.

2486
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,240
You wanna prove it?

2487
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:22,160
I have so much testosterone right now.

2488
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,400
I have so much.

2489
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:24,640
I've got so much.

2490
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:27,780
That's right.

2491
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,780
You wanna measure our antlers together?

2492
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,980
I've got a huge pair of antlers right now.

2493
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,360
I've got a huge pair of antlers right now.

2494
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:37,400
I've got a huge pair of antlers right now.

2495
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:40,220
My antlers are at least 10 inches.

2496
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:40,480
My antlers are at least 10 inches.

2497
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:40,860
Come on.

2498
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,880
At least.

2499
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,920
It's not about the size.

2500
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,140
It's how you use your antlers, fellas.

2501
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,340
Alright.

2502
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:53,580
It's the motion of the ocean.

2503
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:54,420
Right, guys?

2504
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,660
We can't even go in the ocean.

2505
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,380
What are you talking about?

2506
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,800
I can't swim.

2507
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:03,500
I can't swim.

2508
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,260
Oh, the school.

2509
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,380
The school.

2510
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:13,060
Man, I sure hope I don't have a gun between my hands.

2511
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:13,860
I mean, I don't have a gun.

2512
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,640
I mean, hooves between your hands.

2513
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,940
Oh, I know.

2514
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,080
The one deer that instantly ran.

2515
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:21,820
No.

2516
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,460
I have no idea.

2517
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:27,120
Oh my God.

2518
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:27,700
What's happening?

2519
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,380
No idea who that could be.

2520
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:30,740
No idea.

2521
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:33,540
I have no deer.

2522
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:34,340
No.

2523
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,780
That's a fucking wrong deer.

2524
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,720
I have no deer.

2525
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,380
Wrong deer.

2526
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,440
I'm sure you can make it into a pun.

2527
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:45,540
I'm out!

2528
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:45,880
I'm out!

2529
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:49,600
I'm out!

2530
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,980
This shit is so scary!

2531
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,460
It's so scary!

2532
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,680
I heard him say, I'm gonna fucking get you!

2533
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,560
You ain't getting shit.

2534
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,500
Oh my god.

2535
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,620
Wait, you're already insane?

2536
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,280
Wait, you're already insane?

2537
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,600
I shot one deer accidentally.

2538
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,180
You're gonna go insane.

2539
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,500
No, no, no.

2540
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:09,720
Just no way.

2541
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,100
Come on, no way.

2542
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,340
What is the countdown for?

2543
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,920
I know one of you is the deer.

2544
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,440
I know one of you is not real.

2545
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:17,840
You're not real.

2546
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,340
I took my meds today.

2547
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,600
I know one of you is not real.

2548
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,900
Are you real?

2549
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,620
Are you real?

2550
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,620
Let's test that theory.

2551
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,480
Oh no.

2552
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,600
Which one is it?

2553
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,380
I was trapped in a room once.

2554
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,280
Are you real?

2555
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,960
Are you a real deer?

2556
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:40,200
You're a real deer.

2557
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,120
Oh no.

2558
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,200
Who's not real?

2559
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,760
I can see them in my wall.

2560
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,520
How do you know, Anna?

2561
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,660
Everyone's a real deer until they're not.

2562
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,140
How do you know?

2563
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,460
I was crazy once.

2564
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,840
I was crazy once.

2565
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,120
Let me out.

2566
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,640
Where even are you?

2567
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,060
Grab your room full of deer.

2568
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,740
You'll never know.

2569
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:11,400
Oh my god, why are you following me?

2570
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,260
Why is this the only one?

2571
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,800
Two deer are following me.

2572
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,120
There's a lot of deer following me right now.

2573
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,100
There's a lot of deer following me right now.

2574
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,220
You know what?

2575
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,880
I'm sick and tired of waiting.

2576
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:26,900
Me too.

2577
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:27,780
Run!

2578
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,520
Run!

2579
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,080
I got rushed.

2580
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,080
Someone call the ambulance.

2581
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:43,140
Lori!

2582
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,120
Help.

2583
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:53,560
Where did he go?

2584
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,400
Where did he go?

2585
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,480
We're delicious.

2586
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,200
This is the last one.

2587
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,180
Look,

2588
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:05,800
I killed Ron.

2589
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:06,400
I saved his life.

2590
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:07,160
Yes.

2591
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:07,160
No!

2592
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:07,700
No!

2593
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:09,220
Get away!

2594
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:09,700
Get away!

2595
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:10,420
Get away!

2596
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:10,780
Get away!

2597
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,700
There's two of them!

2598
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,240
There's two of them!

2599
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,140
What the...

2600
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,460
Ah, fuck my ankles!

2601
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,240
Oh, there's one left.

2602
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,320
He's wiggling it.

2603
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,060
Oh my god!

2604
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,920
This isn't terrifying enough.

2605
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:28,560
No, it isn't!

2606
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,100
Woo!

2607
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:31,680
Woo!

2608
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:32,680
Yes!

2609
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,100
Ah!

2610
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,640
I can't die!

2611
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,860
I can't die!

2612
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:37,620
Yeah!

2613
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:39,320
Yeah!

2614
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,680
I cannot die!

2615
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,360
Oh no!

2616
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,240
No!

2617
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:49,860
I did it!

2618
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:50,520
I did it!

2619
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,020
I thought I'd poke my head.

2620
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,320
Is foof-phobia a real thing?

2621
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:54,880
Bro!

2622
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,000
It's like Phasmophobia.

2623
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:58,540
Yeah.

2624
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,540
I can't wait for the deer to appear in Lethal Company.

2625
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,160
How tiny is your garden?

2626
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,700
Now, hold up.

2627
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:10,900
In Lethal Company, that actually would be terrifying.

2628
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,260
Just ahead of a deer.

2629
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:13,700
Just ahead of a deer.

2630
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,040
Just ahead of a deer hunting you.

2631
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,380
Chasing you down.

2632
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,460
Oh my god!

2633
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:21,220
I'm gonna go insane.

2634
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,600
This is an awful map.

2635
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,300
Holy crap!

2636
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,700
I'm gonna shoot!

2637
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:28,880
I'm gonna shoot!

2638
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:30,680
I'm gonna shoot!

2639
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,100
Oh fuck!

2640
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,300
Which one is the right deer?

2641
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:35,260
Yeah!

2642
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:37,420
You!

2643
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:39,800
Which one is it?

2644
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,500
Why are you staring at me?

2645
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:42,780
That's why!

2646
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:43,540
Yes!

2647
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:44,260
No!

2648
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:45,380
Don't get her!

2649
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,560
I got stuck in the wood!

2650
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:51,400
Guys, I got stuck on a tree.

2651
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:52,580
Slap it in the wood!

2652
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:53,560
Slap it in the wood!

2653
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:54,740
Where's me?

2654
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:55,380
Where's me?

2655
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:56,400
That's right.

2656
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:56,680
That's right.

2657
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,060
There's no way.

2658
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:57,620
He doesn't know.

2659
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,440
He doesn't know.

2660
01:26:59,520 --> 01:26:59,980
He doesn't know.

2661
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:00,660
No!

2662
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:01,620
He doesn't know!

2663
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:01,900
No!

2664
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,420
It's up to you!

2665
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,380
It's up to you!

2666
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:10,540
I'm not heading... Just so you know, I am not walking towards Sai.

2667
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,140
Just so you...

2668
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:13,640
I think I killed Sai.

2669
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:17,940
Just so you know, I'm not walking towards Sai.

2670
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:19,020
No, you killed me.

2671
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:19,760
I can't double shoot you.

2672
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,240
Oh shit!

2673
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,080
In my defense, the tree trunk got in my way.

2674
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:27,640
She did it!

2675
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,440
She won!

2676
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,940
For the hunters!

2677
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:33,960
That map is so hard!

2678
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:37,060
That tree really fucked me over.

2679
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:37,640
I gotta say.

2680
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:42,320
My hoof got stuck on the branch and I couldn't...

2681
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,400
My hoof got stuck on the branch and I couldn't...

2682
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,520
I told you it's not about the size!

2683
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:45,800
I told you it's not about the size!

2684
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,620
It's how you use it!

2685
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,640
It got stuck!

2686
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,480
My antlers were too big!

2687
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,800
He's running already!

2688
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,320
I don't know who's running already.

2689
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,760
Hey, is that Amelie?

2690
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,740
Right there?

2691
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,160
Where?

2692
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,780
I'm gonna shake my booty!

2693
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,180
Not me!

2694
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,800
I'm shaking my booty right now!

2695
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:08,700
You're too close!

2696
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,140
You're too close!

2697
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,080
Oh, it's Sai?

2698
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,160
Oh, Sai...

2699
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:18,800
You're too close.

2700
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:19,760
I'm gonna shake my booty!

2701
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,840
I have an idea!

2702
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,760
Hey, that's my joke.

2703
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,200
You can't...

2704
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,700
I stole it!

2705
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,420
It's my nail!

2706
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:29,360
It's my nail!

2707
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,420
What the fuck?

2708
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:31,340
Yeah!

2709
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,660
Oh, you're so paranoid!

2710
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:36,200
You're like...

2711
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,800
It's like that old man in the house!

2712
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:44,140
It's like that old man in the house!

2713
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:44,160
It's like that old man in the house!

2714
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:44,780
You're so paranoid!

2715
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,920
You'll never get me, you son of bitches!

2716
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,420
The government can't catch me!

2717
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,480
That's why I never pay taxes!

2718
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,720
I'm off the grid!

2719
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:56,020
I'm going on the swim set!

2720
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:57,700
Swing!

2721
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:58,680
I don't know anymore!

2722
01:28:59,040 --> 01:28:59,280
Shit!

2723
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,300
Is it you?

2724
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,000
It could be any of us.

2725
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,660
There's so many of us.

2726
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,280
Turns out you're all in the fucking bank.

2727
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:09,400
I don't know who could it be!

2728
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:12,800
You're too close, man.

2729
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,360
You're too close!

2730
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,000
You're too close!

2731
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,360
You're too fucking close!

2732
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:21,280
You're too fucking close!

2733
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:21,580
No!

2734
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:24,720
You have to wait!

2735
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:25,440
There's a timer!

2736
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,640
We can't kill him yet!

2737
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,340
Oh no!

2738
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:29,680
It's okay!

2739
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,960
We can get close to him again!

2740
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,480
Oh no!

2741
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:34,080
Just keep walking!

2742
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,520
Oh yeah, I'll walk!

2743
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,480
I'll walk after you!

2744
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:39,420
I'll walk after you!

2745
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:43,640
There's so many of us!

2746
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:44,780
There's so many of us!

2747
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:45,980
There's so many of us!

2748
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,460
We don't know!

2749
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:51,140
He's shooting random deer now!

2750
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,940
He's shooting random deer!

2751
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:56,520
He's nervous!

2752
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:57,100
He's scared!

2753
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,160
He's so scared!

2754
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,600
He's so paranoid!

2755
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:02,280
He's so paranoid!

2756
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,640
He doesn't know which one's the right deer!

2757
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:07,360
He's so paranoid!

2758
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,400
Come on, Sayu!

2759
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,180
You love gacha!

2760
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:10,020
Just choose one!

2761
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,400
Just choose one!

2762
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,080
It could be any of us!

2763
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:13,420
Just choose one!

2764
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:13,420
It could be any of us!

2765
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:14,480
Come on!

2766
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:17,900
We're all in your favor!

2767
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,220
You know what?

2768
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,120
The gacha rates?

2769
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,640
I think the gacha rates is in your favor right now.

2770
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,260
I've seen you pull.

2771
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,100
You've been pretty lucky.

2772
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,660
No, I have not!

2773
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:28,480
Prank!

2774
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:29,040
Prank!

2775
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:30,980
Don't be a coward!

2776
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,720
Take a shot!

2777
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:32,740
Take a shot!

2778
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,100
That could be me right now!

2779
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:34,900
Take the shot!

2780
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:36,240
You're on the floor!

2781
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:37,260
Take the shot!

2782
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,560
Take the other shot!

2783
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:45,520
I'm texting you right now!

2784
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,540
You should take the shot!

2785
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:48,900
Test your gacha!

2786
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,680
Don't you wanna look at my...

2787
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,380
Test the gacha!

2788
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:55,060
Test the gacha!

2789
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:55,720
Test the gacha right now!

2790
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,480
Test the gacha!

2791
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:58,740
Quick!

2792
01:30:58,740 --> 01:30:58,920
Quick!

2793
01:30:59,020 --> 01:30:59,260
Oh yeah!

2794
01:30:59,320 --> 01:30:59,460
Quick!

2795
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,620
There's so many of us here!

2796
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:00,780
Yeah!

2797
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,320
There's so many of us here!

2798
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,020
Take the shot!

2799
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:04,920
Take the shot!

2800
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,000
I'm rezzing!

2801
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:07,920
I'm rezzing right now!

2802
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,380
You're not rezzing!

2803
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:11,980
You're not rezzing at all!

2804
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,700
You're not see me rezz!

2805
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,300
You're not see me rezz!

2806
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,480
Wait, why do I keep getting the E to revive?

2807
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,740
Why do I get a silver?

2808
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:22,680
Take the shot!

2809
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:23,360
Take it!

2810
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:24,880
Take the shot!

2811
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,100
Oh my god!

2812
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:29,620
Holy crap!

2813
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,180
Nice gacha, idiot!

2814
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:35,080
No!

2815
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:35,920
Yeah!

2816
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,100
It was an early pull!

2817
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,560
I still take that as a win.

2818
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,380
That's crazy!

2819
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,280
That's a win in my book!

2820
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:50,460
That's my win!

2821
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:56,360
Oh!

2822
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:56,640
Oh!

2823
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:58,760
Oh!

2824
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,220
Have we played on this one?

2825
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:00,500
Oh!

2826
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:02,880
Oh, we haven't?

2827
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,800
I think he got a pity there.

2828
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:05,860
That was a pity pull.

2829
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,040
That 100% was hard pity!

2830
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:09,260
Oh!

2831
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,480
Oh!

2832
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:14,960
We know who it is now!

2833
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:17,440
I'm scared!

2834
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,020
I'm scared!

2835
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,020
A gun isn't enough to hold you back!

2836
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,040
A gun isn't enough!

2837
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:22,780
It's nighttime!

2838
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,620
Welcome to the circus!

2839
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,440
It's nighttime!

2840
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,160
Welcome to the circus!

2841
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:29,860
I just came to see a funny clown!

2842
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,500
I just came to see a funny clown!

2843
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,780
Welcome to the circus of value!

2844
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:36,760
In the end, it was you!

2845
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,200
You were the clown!

2846
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:39,120
You were the clown!

2847
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:42,400
Kill the clowns!

2848
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,100
Where is she?

2849
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,140
Wait, where is she?

2850
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:46,900
I can't find her!

2851
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:49,680
Why are you getting close to her?

2852
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,440
Who are you?

2853
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:52,980
Oh, I see her!

2854
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,500
Oh, I see her too!

2855
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,460
Stay away from me!

2856
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,740
Stay away from me!

2857
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:58,220
Fuck!

2858
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,360
I'm right next to you!

2859
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,600
I'll come out wherever you are!

2860
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:03,760
Fruit, look behind you!

2861
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,200
This is so funny!

2862
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:06,840
Wee-oo!

2863
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,540
Wee-oo!

2864
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,000
Look behind you, Fruit!

2865
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,320
Why are you running?

2866
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:15,280
Why are you running?

2867
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,700
Oh my god!

2868
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:19,140
Oh my god!

2869
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:20,220
She screams!

2870
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,920
Holy shit!

2871
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,900
That's so scary!

2872
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:24,920
Oh my god!

2873
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,400
I'm in the woods.

2874
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:29,920
I'm behind a tree right now watching your every movement.

2875
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:32,460
Wait, there's another tree!

2876
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:35,360
I'm watching your every move!

2877
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,380
This map is so hard!

2878
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:38,940
Oh dear!

2879
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:41,540
I love that you backed yourself into a corner!

2880
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,340
Oh dear!

2881
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:44,780
What shall we do?

2882
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:48,440
Fruit, where...

2883
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,620
I'm looking at you.

2884
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:51,180
Why are you running to the left, Fruit?

2885
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,940
Why are you running that way?

2886
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,640
I stopped with something over here.

2887
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,080
You're going to the light.

2888
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,560
You're going to let you hear those hoop steps right now.

2889
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:01,840
Why is it so dark?

2890
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:02,960
This is a horror game!

2891
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:03,820
I'm not even joking!

2892
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:04,960
That's right!

2893
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,660
Why is it so dark?

2894
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,960
Holy crap, it's so dark!

2895
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:13,060
I'm crouching in the bushes now!

2896
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:13,320
I'm crouching in the bushes now!

2897
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:15,100
I'm watching your every move.

2898
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,100
Welcome to the sun!

2899
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,000
Right there!

2900
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:21,800
I'm not alone!

2901
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,720
What?

2902
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:30,380
You have one more sanity point left.

2903
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:32,280
Now you're going to lose.

2904
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:35,640
This map is actually so hard!

2905
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,180
Come on, Fruit!

2906
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:40,540
Are you my friend?

2907
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,640
It's time for the next game!

2908
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:46,400
Why don't you come into this tent with some pumpkins?

2909
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,940
Oh my god, you're actually in...

2910
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:50,160
I thought you were in every scene!

2911
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:51,560
Fruit!

2912
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,480
Wake up!

2913
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:58,620
The skinwalkers are here!

2914
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,420
Holy crap!

2915
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:03,940
You missed out on this amazing event!

2916
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:04,960
Are you teabagging me?

2917
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:14,080
Yo, deadass though, there is a tent in there and inside of it are a bunch of scary ass jack-o-lanterns.

2918
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:21,440
And I was just standing on two feet being like, welcome come in.

2919
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,820
Oh shit!

2920
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:28,460
That was like the scariest game I've played all year.

2921
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:31,060
That is the true horror experience.

2922
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,280
It's true.

2923
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:33,380
I think I have hoophobia.

2924
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,860
Oh hey, that's the title of the game!

2925
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:38,740
That's the title of the game!

2926
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:39,360
Wrong game!

2927
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:41,920
Wrong game.

2928
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,720
Oh, it's Amelie!

2929
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,100
Oh no, I glistened the glass again!

2930
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:48,160
Oh no!

2931
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,560
Oh no!

2932
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,680
Whatever will we do?

2933
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:55,080
It's time to use those apex skills.

2934
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,640
Time to shake my ass.

2935
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:02,420
Holy crap!

2936
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,360
Worth it!

2937
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,100
Worth it!

2938
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:05,680
Worth it!

2939
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,280
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to retire now.

2940
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:10,620
I'm chewing.

2941
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:11,440
I'm chewing.

2942
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:14,820
Don't worry, he's definitely not crawling towards another deer.

2943
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:18,740
I'm just gonna shake.

2944
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:19,040
Oh!

2945
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,020
He's definitely not crawling to another deer waiting to get revived.

2946
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,600
Nope.

2947
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:26,180
Nope.

2948
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:27,480
That's not what I'm doing.

2949
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:28,740
Nope, he's not doing that.

2950
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,520
That's right, you should- What the fuck?!

2951
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,720
The reflex!

2952
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:36,060
Holy shit!

2953
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:36,880
Excuse me.

2954
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:39,140
I'm gonna keep...

2955
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,740
That's right.

2956
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,580
Guys, I'm so safe.

2957
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:44,700
Don't worry, I'm so safe.

2958
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,360
She is like not near me at all.

2959
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,560
Guys, I'm in the...

2960
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:51,320
I'm in the river.

2961
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:52,660
I'm in the river.

2962
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:57,640
Just start grazing on my body and I'll be okay.

2963
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,040
It's gonna be so natural.

2964
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,680
Where are you?

2965
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,440
Come out, come out wherever you are.

2966
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,980
She can't see me, I'm in the water.

2967
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:07,940
Are you scared?

2968
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:10,200
She's terrifying for you.

2969
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:11,860
We'll body block.

2970
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:19,000
You remember that scene from Toy Story 1 where all the dead toys were crawling to the same cat's you?

2971
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,380
You're safe now.

2972
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,120
I can't get out of the river.

2973
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,380
What are you doing?

2974
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,380
Which one is fruit?

2975
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:27,640
It's me.

2976
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,860
I'm fruit.

2977
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,480
We're all fruit here.

2978
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,960
We're all fruit here.

2979
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,840
We're all fruit here.

2980
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:35,920
Oh no.

2981
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,940
I might not have my fruit list anymore.

2982
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:44,560
But I have my passion.

2983
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:46,920
You're going crazy.

2984
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,520
We're all fruit here.

2985
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:52,160
Looks like we're all fruit here.

2986
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,180
Yeah.

2987
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:57,320
Bro, whatever we get on our two legs is just so fucking scary.

2988
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,360
It's so scary.

2989
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:00,420
It's so scary.

2990
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:04,820
It's always scary when you're not looking at the deer and you just hear the footsteps coming from behind you.

2991
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,040
Yeah.

2992
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:07,900
It is.

2993
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:09,040
It's so loud too.

2994
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,860
You never know which is the right one.

2995
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,340
Oh, back where it all started.

2996
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,680
Going back to school.

2997
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,220
That's why we banned all the rules.

2998
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:24,140
Hey guys, how about we give them an education?

2999
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,540
What the fuck?

3000
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,600
How did you die already?

3001
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:27,720
Dude.

3002
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:29,860
I didn't see that she was right there.

3003
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,820
Dude, sigh.

3004
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,740
I was just excited.

3005
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:36,080
I was excited about deer school.

3006
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,560
I'm gonna camp your body.

3007
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,060
You're a whore.

3008
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:42,220
That's so fucked up.

3009
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:44,100
Get away from me, you freak.

3010
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,680
Bro, how could you do that to him?

3011
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,480
He's just trying to be a deer.

3012
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,060
He's trying to go to deer high.

3013
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,780
He's trying to get an education.

3014
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:57,720
Yeah, he's trying to get a degree.

3015
01:38:58,620 --> 01:38:59,260
Get away from me.

3016
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,220
I can't believe it.

3017
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,640
Now he's gonna be held back and it's gonna be your fault.

3018
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:10,060
What will his dear parents say?

3019
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:13,420
Oh.

3020
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,740
He has no future.

3021
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,060
Get away from me.

3022
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:23,680
I don't like you.

3023
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:24,620
Go away.

3024
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,320
Ain't nobody gonna revive you.

3025
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,780
Oh shit, did you get her?

3026
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:32,360
Oh shit, did you get her?

3027
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:33,260
Are you limping?

3028
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,000
Run!

3029
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:36,940
Save yourself!

3030
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,680
Don't be a hero!

3031
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:41,540
Don't be a hero!

3032
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:43,640
I'm falling.

3033
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:44,560
Oh no.

3034
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,840
I'm falling off of Lego bridge.

3035
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:48,100
Guys, get behind the tree.

3036
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:49,680
We will do the tree strat.

3037
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,000
It's always worked.

3038
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,020
Oh fruit.

3039
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,800
The tree strat.

3040
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:56,440
Yeah.

3041
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,460
Wait, where are ya?

3042
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:00,380
I don't know.

3043
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:01,460
Maybe she gotcha again.

3044
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:02,640
Gotcha.

3045
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:04,000
I'm in your right motion.

3046
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:06,920
Could this be you fruit?

3047
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:08,780
Are you shaking your booty?

3048
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,000
I'm shaking my booty.

3049
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:11,760
What happened?

3050
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:15,900
Are you entertained?

3051
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:18,080
Are you entertained?

3052
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:19,600
Woah,

3053
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,440
that was perfect.

3054
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:24,300
What the frick?

3055
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:25,980
God damn it.

3056
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,680
That deer followed me.

3057
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:31,920
Oh.

3058
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,080
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

3059
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,620
Come on fruit.

3060
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:39,260
Don't be scared.

3061
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,980
I gotta shake my ass first.

3062
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:42,920
Are you not up?

3063
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:44,960
You're alive!

3064
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:46,580
You're alive Zy!

3065
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:48,780
Wait, what?

3066
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,580
I'm not alive.

3067
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,960
I gen revive you like two times.

3068
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,420
Hey, don't look at me.

3069
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,700
I'm still flopping around like a big guy.

3070
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,580
I can't believe it.

3071
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:59,840
This is why you flunked out of deer high.

3072
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:02,720
Why do you think I was trying to get educated?

3073
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,700
This is exactly why you flunked out.

3074
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,920
This is exactly why you flunked out.

3075
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:09,240
Don't worry.

3076
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:10,460
Don't worry.

3077
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:11,600
I got you.

3078
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:12,760
You are...

3079
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,840
Oh fruit!

3080
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:23,820
All I'm saying Zy is that fruit was an easy run.

3081
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,120
Yeah.

3082
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,920
I'm not that easy.

3083
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,040
Did you ever think about that?

3084
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:29,960
Oh!

3085
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:31,380
Here we go.

3086
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,840
It's time to cast.

3087
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:37,840
I want to shoot an eye out.

3088
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:39,960
I'm from the tree guys.

3089
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:43,940
Yay.

3090
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:47,980
We contributed.

3091
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,240
You can actually teabag when you're still up.

3092
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,080
It's so funny.

3093
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,380
I tried to.

3094
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,500
I am free.

3095
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,260
I didn't do shit.

3096
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,360
I'm just part of the group.

3097
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:02,560
Yay.

3098
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:05,660
Tiny got it.

3099
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:06,200
Oh no.

3100
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:07,200
Oh no.

3101
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:10,020
Please don't hunt that.

3102
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:11,820
God damn it.

3103
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:15,660
If you say please don't hunt that, you're gonna get hunted.

3104
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:17,600
I'm a hunter.

3105
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:19,020
Oh you're going in the corner.

3106
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,520
I'm a deer just like you guys.

3107
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:21,880
Okay never mind.

3108
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:23,520
I'm a deer just like you guys.

3109
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:26,820
Oh man.

3110
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:27,960
I see you.

3111
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:30,500
You should do a gotcha pull.

3112
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:31,820
Anyone who gets close to me, I'm shooting.

3113
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:33,320
You should do a gotcha pull.

3114
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:35,700
Yeah do a gotcha pull.

3115
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:36,900
Test your luck.

3116
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,180
Come on.

3117
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:40,180
I bet you have good luck.

3118
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:41,920
It's just one shot.

3119
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,220
Oh god no.

3120
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,320
I have the worst luck.

3121
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:45,240
It's just one shot.

3122
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:47,300
Yeah.

3123
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,280
Why are you scared of one shot?

3124
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:50,980
Come on.

3125
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,200
It's one out of five shots.

3126
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:55,900
Why do I feel like the one shot is actually going to get us?

3127
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:58,380
Test it.

3128
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:59,220
I hope you get side.

3129
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:01,160
That would be so funny if you use that one shot.

3130
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,940
Take that one shot right now.

3131
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,880
Take that one shot.

3132
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:11,900
AHHHHH I knew it was you.

3133
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:12,600
I was gonna shoot.

3134
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:13,220
I was gonna shoot.

3135
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,940
I knew that was you.

3136
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,100
I should have shot.

3137
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:16,820
I should have shot.

3138
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:17,580
I told you.

3139
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,600
You should have done it.

3140
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:21,120
My luck was on my side there.

3141
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,040
It was right there.

3142
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:24,980
Take that shot now.

3143
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,600
Take that shot.

3144
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,180
Take that shot.

3145
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:32,960
Wow.

3146
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:34,160
Wow.

3147
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,060
You almost had me.

3148
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:41,320
What the fuck?

3149
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,520
Wait did my character just say the F word?

3150
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:44,940
How did you get me?

3151
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:47,160
Hey.

3152
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,200
Not to alarm anyone.

3153
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:53,920
But uh.

3154
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:55,380
You kicked me out of the map.

3155
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,180
Yeah.

3156
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,720
I think it was like back there.

3157
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:00,800
Wait look at him.

3158
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:01,560
It's so funny.

3159
01:44:02,130 --> 01:44:03,820
I'm gonna explore the...

3160
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:08,340
I'm gonna explore the outside world.

3161
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:09,140
No.

3162
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,960
Oh my god.

3163
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,600
Are you seeing things?

3164
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:16,460
This is the trippiest shit ever.

3165
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,280
I'm falling off.

3166
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,680
You like off the map?

3167
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:26,240
Bro I am literally falling.

3168
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,200
Bro.

3169
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,720
I am in another world now.

3170
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:30,820
Oh my god.

3171
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,720
Did you see that?

3172
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:34,940
Where is he?

3173
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:36,000
I'm deer.

3174
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:36,800
I'm deer.

3175
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,120
I'm deer.

3176
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,280
I'm deer.

3177
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:37,440
I'm deer.

3178
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,360
I'm deer.

3179
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:51,460
I'm leaving.

3180
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:57,620
See this is what happens when you let me play a game.

3181
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:59,940
I have the tendency to break these fucking things.

3182
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:02,140
I'm just saying.

3183
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:03,640
I think this game is pretty broken.

3184
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:05,260
Emily is definitely not heading towards me.

3185
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:06,640
She was more early on in the game.

3186
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:07,660
I'm gonna head to the bushes.

3187
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:09,240
Yeah so I can break them all.

3188
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,320
I'm gonna head to the bushes.

3189
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,060
I'm in there.

3190
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:13,880
I'm in there.

3191
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:18,580
You stay away from me.

3192
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:18,720
Where are you?

3193
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,800
Which one is the real deer?

3194
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:27,220
And I sure wish I could see my friends playing the deer game.

3195
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:30,700
Should have fallen through the map.

3196
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:34,240
I was like you following me as I crawl around the floor.

3197
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:35,700
Yep.

3198
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:36,780
Why do you guys do that?

3199
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:38,320
Oh my god.

3200
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:42,140
You Which one are you?

3201
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:45,160
We are gonna start standing up.

3202
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,380
We are gonna get our two legs.

3203
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:10,400
I can't believe it.

3204
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:13,840
Bro, Fruit has the luckiest scotch out of all of us right there.

3205
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:15,460
That was so lucky.

3206
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:17,520
I wasted my gacha for the...

3207
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,440
Well, it's time for a paranoid old man.

3208
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:21,760
There he is.

3209
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,240
I'm gonna step on your line.

3210
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,680
Please don't.

3211
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:27,020
Don't play!

3212
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,160
I said no!

3213
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,740
You're surrounded.

3214
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,360
I could be that deer right next to you right now.

3215
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:38,260
That's right.

3216
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,960
Oh, look at him.

3217
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,360
Left and right.

3218
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:44,640
Look at him go.

3219
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,560
I still don't know what the timer is.

3220
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,760
Shooting random things I see.

3221
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:52,500
Yeah.

3222
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,220
Come on.

3223
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:53,840
Do your gacha pull.

3224
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:54,900
Come on.

3225
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,820
Just do a gacha pull.

3226
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,380
Yeah, do a gacha pull.

3227
01:46:58,380 --> 01:46:58,900
Come on.

3228
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:02,740
If my chat gives subs, I'll shoot blindly right now.

3229
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,020
How many gifted subs?

3230
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:07,940
Do the pull.

3231
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,480
Maybe you'll get the pity.

3232
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,140
Just for five.

3233
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:11,840
That'd be fun.

3234
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,360
You'll get the pity right there.

3235
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:13,640
I'm crazy.

3236
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:15,420
Yeah, do it.

3237
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:15,620
Do it.

3238
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:15,900
Do it.

3239
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,660
I dare you.

3240
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:20,100
I double dare you.

3241
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:22,400
I triple dare you.

3242
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:23,600
You're getting awfully close there.

3243
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,340
Hey, thanks for the five gifted, you'll want...

3244
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:28,300
Oh!

3245
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,940
Well, well!

3246
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:34,180
Okay, you're getting the pity.

3247
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:35,800
You're lucky I'm a match.

3248
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:36,820
That's right.

3249
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:37,520
You can't even get me.

3250
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,040
You look mighty good in orange.

3251
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:41,640
Ooh, are you gonna look at that boulder now?

3252
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:44,320
Whoever comes out of that boulder might be me.

3253
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:44,820
I'm gonna do it.

3254
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:44,980
I'm gonna do it.

3255
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:45,000
I'm gonna do it.

3256
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,220
The boulder.

3257
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:48,100
Do it!

3258
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:48,800
Distracting him!

3259
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:49,520
Go, go, go!

3260
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:53,060
Oh, God!

3261
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:53,460
You missed him!

3262
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:54,660
We're moving in.

3263
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:56,620
We're moving in.

3264
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,300
Wait, Emily, are you...

3265
01:47:59,300 --> 01:47:59,900
Are you dead?

3266
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:01,760
Nope.

3267
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:03,600
No, Emily's just a...

3268
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,220
Oh, shit!

3269
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:06,760
It's crouching next to me.

3270
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,280
You're lucky I'm a bad shot!

3271
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:12,280
You missed again, old man!

3272
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,600
That's right.

3273
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,420
I'm an old man.

3274
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:16,700
Oh, damn.

3275
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,220
Bro, what are you doing with that other deer fruit?

3276
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:22,900
What are you...

3277
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:23,640
I don't know!

3278
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:24,420
I don't know!

3279
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,480
My cap freaked out.

3280
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:26,880
What are you doing with that other deer?

3281
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:27,920
Come on, Ty, you're in the corner!

3282
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:28,320
Are you scared?

3283
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:30,760
I'm not fucking scared!

3284
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:33,100
You're in the corner!

3285
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:33,880
Come on!

3286
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:34,580
Come on!

3287
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:36,580
That's me over there.

3288
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:37,980
That's me.

3289
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,260
Okay, I...

3290
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:39,800
That's me.

3291
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:40,540
Ow!

3292
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:42,180
Dude, I...

3293
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:42,880
My leg!

3294
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,260
What the fuck?

3295
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:44,460
What the fuck?

3296
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:44,560
I'm...

3297
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,860
Bro, I shot three different times.

3298
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:48,200
Chat, you saw that.

3299
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:49,240
My bullets weren't working.

3300
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,100
My bullets weren't working!

3301
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:51,260
I don't know.

3302
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,460
Maybe you were just missing.

3303
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:57,080
What are you shooting at?

3304
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:58,820
Where are you shooting at?

3305
01:48:58,900 --> 01:48:59,560
I'm shooting at that deer!

3306
01:48:59,560 --> 01:48:59,720
I got it!

3307
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:00,920
I'm shooting at that deer!

3308
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:02,660
Where are you shooting at?

3309
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:03,540
Bro...

3310
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:03,840
Wait.

3311
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:06,340
Is there no deer there for you guys?

3312
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,360
There was never a deer there.

3313
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:08,720
No.

3314
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:12,080
All the deer are on that one side of the map right now.

3315
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:13,640
No, you're shooting at nothing.

3316
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:14,900
We were shooting at nothing.

3317
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:16,820
Alright, alright, but no one trample me.

3318
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,920
Yeah, no problem.

3319
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:19,520
This?

3320
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,600
I shot you!

3321
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:25,320
At different times!

3322
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:27,780
I stopped you, chat!

3323
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,480
You all saw it!

3324
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,680
You all saw it!

3325
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:35,920
You all saw it!

3326
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,140
I shot that deer!

3327
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:39,700
That specific deer!

3328
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:41,940
At different times!

3329
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:44,720
I don't know, maybe you're doing this...

3330
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,840
Game is beyond rigged!

3331
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:49,140
I don't know, maybe you just missed.

3332
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,420
Maybe you were missing.

3333
01:49:57,580 --> 01:49:58,140
What?

3334
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:59,440
Did he shot you guys?

3335
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:00,780
No, yeah!

3336
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:02,500
He got both of us somehow!

3337
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:04,220
He got both of you guys!

3338
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:05,360
Not me!

3339
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:09,260
That's fucking karma, you sons of bitches!

3340
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:10,320
He did not get me!

3341
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,840
But he got both of you!

3342
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:14,800
He did!

3343
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:20,260
What the...

3344
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:21,380
Oh, you're just joking.

3345
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:22,960
For a second I thought you were levitating.

3346
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:23,800
I was like, oh!

3347
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:26,560
Boing, boing, boing!

3348
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:27,500
Boom!

3349
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:31,120
You've got to be fucking kidding me!

3350
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:35,520
You never get me!

3351
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:40,900
I'm like that... what's that whale story?

3352
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:45,740
The Moby Dick, I'm your Moby Dick right now!

3353
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,260
Yeah!

3354
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:49,320
This is such bullshit!

3355
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:52,160
The walking animation is so funny!

3356
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,000
The walking animation is so funny!

3357
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,340
The walking animation is so funny!

3358
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:58,060
I'm your Moby Dick!

3359
01:50:58,220 --> 01:50:59,340
You'll never catch me!

3360
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:00,180
I'm stuck!

3361
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:00,900
I'm stuck!

3362
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:03,360
You're walking...

3363
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,880
Bro, I don't know what it is!

3364
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:07,080
Oh, no!

3365
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:08,460
No!

3366
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:08,700
No!

3367
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:12,420
I got you, you son of a bitch!

3368
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:14,020
Bro!

3369
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:15,800
I'm...

3370
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:16,900
Bro!

3371
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:22,920
I am telling you, I shot you five different times!

3372
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,780
Just get good!

3373
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,640
Just get good!

3374
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,540
Oh my god!

3375
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:31,740
Hi, are you ready?

3376
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:33,960
Back where it started.

3377
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:35,520
You want this to be LG?

3378
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,920
Oh, brother!

3379
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,720
Is that Psy again?

3380
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:43,080
Oh, I knew it!

3381
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:46,240
I'm not going to live this shit down, fellas!

3382
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:47,780
LG on Psy!

3383
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:48,440
Let's go!

3384
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:51,280
Life begins after school!

3385
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,000
That's where we've been!

3386
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:54,840
All the rules!

3387
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:56,900
Oh, there they are!

3388
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:58,960
There they are!

3389
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,440
There they are!

3390
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:01,840
I'm shaking my booty for you!

3391
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:03,540
Just like deer hide!

3392
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:04,460
Oh, my god!

3393
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,760
My throne has...

3394
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,040
How much screaming I did!

3395
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:12,540
The place where we belong!

3396
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:14,300
He didn't get the good pause!

3397
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,040
You guys are too close!

3398
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,500
Psy, are you scared?

3399
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,040
Yeah, why are you so scared?

3400
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,480
Don't make me jump on top of my RV!

3401
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,420
Get down from the RV, old man!

3402
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:26,620
You're going to break your back!

3403
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:28,580
RV, you say?

3404
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:29,620
You're going to break your back!

3405
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,020
You're awfully close!

3406
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:35,620
Shoot him!

3407
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,360
That's me!

3408
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:37,040
Shoot it!

3409
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:37,560
Take the shot!

3410
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:39,440
Oh, dude!

3411
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:43,720
Now you'll never know if that one...

3412
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:45,740
If any other deer is going to be me now!

3413
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:48,360
Now you'll never know!

3414
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,040
You see that deer over there that you're looking at?

3415
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,140
Take the shot!

3416
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:54,080
Take the shot!

3417
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:54,540
That's me!

3418
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,680
Take the shot!

3419
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:57,240
That's me right there!

3420
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:58,360
Come on!

3421
01:52:58,380 --> 01:52:58,600
Do it!

3422
01:52:58,640 --> 01:52:59,080
That's me!

3423
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:01,940
Take the shot!

3424
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,020
That deer you're looking at!

3425
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:04,580
Take the shot!

3426
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:07,600
Take the shot!

3427
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:08,740
You're so paranoid!

3428
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:17,710
You're so paranoid!

3429
01:53:17,830 --> 01:53:19,290
He's so fucking scared!

3430
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:21,270
I'm a pig!

3431
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:22,750
I sold Hunter's sanity!

3432
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:24,750
You should have taken the shot!

3433
01:53:25,150 --> 01:53:25,690
Oh!

3434
01:53:27,610 --> 01:53:28,810
Where did you go?

3435
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:29,750
You only got one shot!

3436
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:32,310
You only got one shot at deer high!

3437
01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:34,330
Oh my god!

3438
01:53:35,170 --> 01:53:37,050
Hey, that deer that's really close to you...

3439
01:53:37,050 --> 01:53:37,530
Take the shot!

3440
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:38,430
Take it!

3441
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:41,370
Take the shot!

3442
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:42,130
Come on!

3443
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:42,970
That's me right there!

3444
01:53:43,170 --> 01:53:43,550
Come on!

3445
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:49,750
I'm losing my goddamn mind here, fellas!

3446
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:50,910
Take that shot!

3447
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:51,310
That deer!

3448
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:52,230
That's me right here!

3449
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:53,110
Come on!

3450
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:53,550
Take the shot!

3451
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:55,690
You know you want to!

3452
01:53:57,310 --> 01:54:00,050
You should have taken the shot when you had to!

3453
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:00,490
No!

3454
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:01,930
No!

3455
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:03,290
He took the shot!

3456
01:54:04,330 --> 01:54:06,210
There's one of you motherfuckers left!

3457
01:54:06,350 --> 01:54:09,070
Oh, now you're going crazy!

3458
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:11,970
Oh!

3459
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:12,430
Oh no!

3460
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:13,670
Yeah!

3461
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:15,810
Yay!

3462
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:19,670
Wait, you're like slow and you're like on your...

3463
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:20,890
Oh my god.

3464
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:22,050
He took the shot!

3465
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:24,230
He took the shot!

3466
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:25,630
My god!

3467
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:27,090
He actually did it!

3468
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:28,430
That was fun!

3469
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:29,910
I don't know about you, but...

3470
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:31,270
Yeah, this is so much fun.

3471
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:31,870
This is amazing.

3472
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:32,570
This is great.

3473
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:33,470
I love this game.

3474
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:34,310
This is what this game is all about.

3475
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:36,010
This is what this game is all about.

3476
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:38,650
They gotta increase the player...

3477
01:54:38,650 --> 01:54:40,050
Oh yeah!

3478
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:41,350
That would be so fun.

3479
01:54:41,430 --> 01:54:43,730
The player size and more maps.

3480
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:45,110
I think it would be so fun.

3481
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:47,410
It's still early access.

3482
01:54:47,650 --> 01:54:48,510
It's still early access.

3483
01:54:48,730 --> 01:54:52,030
I definitely like the imposter one the most.

3484
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:54,010
That one was my favorite game though.

3485
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:55,290
That was the best.

3486
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:57,530
And GG's!

3487
01:54:57,590 --> 01:54:58,710
Thank you for joining me!

3488
01:54:59,210 --> 01:54:59,310
Yeah!

3489
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:00,070
Super fun!

3490
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:01,310
GG's!

3491
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:03,470
I had a great time!

3492
01:55:04,050 --> 01:55:06,530
I never laughed so much in my life.

3493
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:06,850
I know!

3494
01:55:07,990 --> 01:55:09,550
It was super chaotic.

3495
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:13,870
I think my favorite part was just making Sy so fucking paranoid.

3496
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:15,750
I think my favorite part was just making Sy so fucking paranoid.

3497
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:16,850
Well, it worked!

3498
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:18,050
Well, it worked!

3499
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:20,090
You know, I looked at you...

3500
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:21,090
I hope you have wonderful dreams.

3501
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:24,530
I was so close to you for so long, but you never took the shot.

3502
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:24,930
I do!

3503
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:27,650
She was saying take the shot.

3504
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:29,470
That was actually her the whole time.

3505
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:30,610
I do!

3506
01:55:30,610 --> 01:55:31,250
I was so happy!

3507
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:35,170
Oh my god!

3508
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:37,110
That was so good!

3509
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:40,310
GG's!

3510
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:40,770
GG's!

3511
01:55:40,810 --> 01:55:41,610
Thank you everybody!

3512
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:43,970
Thanks for having me!

3513
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:46,330
I'll see you guys later guys!

3514
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:47,470
Bye!

3515
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:48,050
Bye!

3516
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:48,990
Bye!

3517
01:55:51,970 --> 01:55:53,070
Oh my god!

3518
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:53,690
That was so fun!

3519
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:56,230
I'm glad to be able to try out this game.

3520
01:55:56,350 --> 01:55:57,630
Yeah, this is early access.

3521
01:55:57,710 --> 01:56:00,270
When the game first came out, it was like...

3522
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:00,590
I don't know.

3523
01:56:00,610 --> 01:56:04,730
When the game first came out, it was just like no multiplayer servers.

3524
01:56:05,070 --> 01:56:05,950
Or private servers.

3525
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:07,990
So I was like waiting.

3526
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:10,130
When I saw that they finally had private servers, I was like...

3527
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:11,030
Oh my god, this is going to be so fun.

3528
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:15,730
I definitely enjoyed the imposter one the most.

3529
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:17,750
That one was so fun!

3530
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:20,130
That was so fun with all the deers.

3531
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:23,630
Yeah!

3532
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:25,890
I'm glad to be able to try it out guys.

3533
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:27,050
And I hope you guys had fun.

3534
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:29,730
I had fun with...

3535
01:56:30,610 --> 01:56:32,570
Sy, Amelie, and Fruit.

3536
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:34,030
I had a great time with them.

3537
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:36,190
Let me swap screens real quick.

3538
01:56:36,970 --> 01:56:37,770
Oh my god!

3539
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:40,550
I laughed so much and screamed so much.

3540
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:43,110
My voice is dying already.

3541
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:44,630
Holy shit!

3542
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:45,370
But yeah guys!

3543
01:56:45,490 --> 01:56:46,670
Did you guys see the new emotes?

3544
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:48,450
Did you guys see the new emotes?

3545
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:50,810
I added more... these are all like placeholder emotes.

3546
01:56:51,190 --> 01:56:53,750
Until like I actually have new emotes.

3547
01:56:53,770 --> 01:56:54,570
I haven't like...

3548
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:56,150
commissioned any new emotes yet.

3549
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:57,690
Because I won't wait until...

3550
01:56:57,690 --> 01:57:00,070
I'm waiting until like we have...

3551
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:03,190
We have our new skin suit.

3552
01:57:03,370 --> 01:57:07,470
Because I don't want to commission them and then be like, oh shit now I have to like redo all my emotes.

3553
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:09,250
So that's why we haven't got them yet.

01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:12,820

That's like the hardest part about streaming.

3570
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:31,760
Just like... um...

3571
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:33,720
Just like...

3572
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:37,640
Trying to find like times for everybody that will work for everyone.

3573
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,520
That's why we like redid our...

3574
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:47,880
um... um... changed our schedule lineup a bit to have it today instead of tomorrow.

3575
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:50,740
Because it fit everybody's schedule.

3576
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:54,360
Because I was like, oh my gosh if we play this one we should have a full party.

3577
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,180
Because um...

3578
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:58,540
Obviously it's going to be more chaotic.

3579
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,320
And it will be more fun to have...

3580
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:00,740
Jesus!

3581
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,980

01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,820

I think my favorite part was just the 360.

3630
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:15,300
The 360...

3631
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:18,620
Every time I was just...

3632
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:25,080
I was using movement on everybody with the with the 360 uh... jump.

3633
01:59:29,650 --> 01:59:33,310
It's just the 360 like... Oh you can't catch me!

01:59:33,470 --> 01:59:34,730
You can't catch me!

Is ketchup a sauce or a gravy?

It's a sauce!

3642
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:47,880

Thank you!

3646
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:53,000
I love another stream for this game.

3647
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:53,480
That was hilarious.

3648
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:54,160

Thank you!

3652
01:59:55,600 --> 02:00:05,600
I think like um... Definitely in the future for this game, I'm gonna wait until there's more uh... There's more like modes to it and more like maps and stuff.

3653
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:06,540
Because like...

3654
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:07,800
It's definitely a one off.

3655
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:14,940
This is uh... This is definitely a one off game because um... At a point it gets... It gets old.

3656
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:16,560
We play it too long.

3657
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:17,260
Uh...

3658
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:18,820
Yeah.

3659
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:23,060
When there's more content in there, it'd definitely be more fun.

3660
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:24,320
Um...

3661
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,780

Thank you!

3664
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:32,360
I was surprised that you didn't run when the hunter was looking away so that they would be more paranoid when they hear hooves and stomp after a bit.

3665
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:33,260
Thank you for the super chat!

3666

02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:36,460

3669
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:39,080
say next... Like run around him and just stay there.

3670
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:39,960

02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:35,160
I can... I bet you I have some vouchers in my chat.

3710
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:38,060
This is how hunting is all about guys.

3711
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:38,940
This is...

3712
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,780
This is the true hunting experience.

3713
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:43,600
Like if you're...

3714
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:47,120
If the deers don't stand up on their two feet, that's not real hunting.

3715
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,940
That's not real hunting.

3716
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:52,120
You gotta watch out for those skinwalkers.

3717
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:53,700
They're right there.

3718
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:54,700
Hahaha!

3719
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:58,160
They could be any one of us.

3720
02:01:58,320 --> 02:01:58,620
Hahaha!

3721
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:00,520
It's like that adventure time.

3722
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:02,460
Um...

3723
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:03,560
That adventure time.

3724
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:07,380
Uh... uh... deer meme where he takes off his hose and he's like...

3725
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:07,860
Hahaha!

3726
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:11,600
Uh...

3727
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:13,020
Uh... wait!

3728
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:13,840
Thank you for the super chat!

3729
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:14,120
Thank you!

3730
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:14,580
Thank you!

3731
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:15,460
I'm in Europe.

3732
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:17,200
Night shift lets me watch... Yeah!

3733
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:18,220
Thank you for the super chat!

3734
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:18,520
Thank you!

3735
02:02:18,580 --> 02:02:19,020
Thank you!

3736
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:24,140
Yeah, trying to... get like... I always have like a very consistent stream schedule.

3737
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:30,140
So most of the time it's just usually like 5pm PST and 12.30pm PST.

3738
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:34,020
And if I collabs with people on the other side of the world, obviously it's gonna be a little later.

3739
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:38,380
Um... so I do try to keep it very consistent.

3740
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:39,660
Um...

3741
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:43,720
But I do apologize for people on the other side of the world because...

3742
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:44,320
Hahaha!

3743
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:45,660
It's not...

3744
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:48,840
My streams for them is like super early in the morning.

3745
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
So like... I do apologize for that.

3746
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:51,820
My usual streams.

3747
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:54,100
Uh... let's see.

3748
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:56,820
Endwatcher Thank you for the super chat!

3749
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:57,140
Thank you!

3750
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:57,560
Thank you!

3751
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:59,420
Only the tomato skin is expensive.

3752
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:00,260
Not the skin.

3753
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:01,240
So thank you for the super chat!

3754
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:01,620
Thank you!

3755
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:02,040
Thank you!

3756
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:02,500
Oh my god!

3757
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:03,900
But speaking of like...

3758
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:06,100
Uh... streams on the other side of the world.

3759
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,880
Uh... streams for the people on the other side of the world.

3760
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:13,340
I will be collabing next week with... uh...

3761
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:16,660
Ditto, Uto, and RPR I think.

3762
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:19,340
We're doing Lethal Company next week.

3763
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:20,020
I think we are.

3764
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:23,860
We're still setting that up but I assume it was supposed to be this week.

3765
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:30,120
But there's so many stuff happening for me this week that we decided to move it to next week.

3766
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:32,540
So we're still deciding the date and the time.

3767
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:35,620
But we'll be playing Lethal Company for next week.

3768
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:36,960
Uh... but yeah!

3769
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:38,160
That's... I think that's...

3770
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:48,180
I mean... it's really hard because I try to organize... I try not to like... stuff... so the thing about this was like I'm planning on doing a stream talking about like how I... my mind works when it comes to streaming.

3771
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:49,840
But like... um...

3772
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:59,460
the best advice I can give people is that... this is like a sneak peek to this like the stream that I'm planning that I've been writing notes for about like... um... making... not just VTubing but like content creation.

3773
02:03:59,780 --> 02:04:02,020
But like... um...

3774
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:05,120
I try not to put too many collabs in one week.

3775
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:10,120
But if there is a lot of collabs in for a week, I balance it out with more solo streams.

3776
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:14,540
Um... because you don't want to have two more collabs than solo streams.

3777
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:18,040
And it's more so like... um... you try to do...

3778
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:19,920
for me right now, my...

3779
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:25,740
uh... for me right now I try to have like at least one to two collabs a week.

3780
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:27,260
Um... just to get started.

3781
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:33,440
Uh... I think you might notice that this is a similar pattern when I first uh... when I first started streaming.

3782
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:35,860
Um...

3783
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:40,160
When I first started... not first started streaming but when I first started being serious with streaming.

3784
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:41,620
When I kicked things off.

3785
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:45,320
Because when you're first starting out, you have to get your name out there.

3786
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,760
So like collabing is a great way to do that.

3787
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:54,980
And um... and so you I had like a whole thing where I was like every week I would like to have at least one collab.

3788
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,160
Just to get my name out there.

3789
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:01,560
And to like uh... make people know who I am because I was new.

3790
02:05:02,020 --> 02:05:03,360
I was new in the...

3791
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:05,120
basically new in the world.

3792
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:05,740
Uh...

3793
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:13,000
So like because like now I'm restarting my career again.

3794
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:18,040
So that's why I try to make sure like every week I have at least one to two collabs.

3795
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:22,560
Um... if I don't have two collabs I have like something like you know the tournaments or something.

3796
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,120
Because that's considered a collab.

3797
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:25,220
Um...

3798
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:32,740
So it's more so of like uh... like every week I want at least one collab with someone.

3799
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:35,680
Um... and it's good to like networking.

3800
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:43,580
Uh... and despite me being an introvert I try my best to socialize as much as I can.

3801
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:44,320
.

3802
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:49,720
Um... Chris thank you for the super chat.

3803
02:05:49,820 --> 02:05:50,080
Thank you.

3804
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:52,520
I couldn't be more proud of you and your new journey.

3805
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:53,280
I can't have I tried.

3806
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:55,460
Can't wait to 100% my Doki...

3807
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:56,000
You'll never.

3808
02:05:56,060 --> 02:05:58,200
You'll never 100% your Doki shrine.

3809
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:00,760
But you can try.

3810
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:05,060
You can have 99% because you'll never beat me.

3811
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:08,600
It'll never be 100% because you'll never beat me.

3812
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,940
Keep doing your best.

3813
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:11,120
Thank you for the super chat.

3814
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:11,520
Thank you.

3815
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:12,140
Thank you.

3816
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:13,260
Thank you.

3817
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:13,540
Thank you.

3818
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:16,380
I can't really wait for the intro to collab again.

3819
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:17,080
Is it coming...

3820
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:18,260
Is it still coming soon?

3821
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:19,020
Um...

3822
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:21,500
I'm just uh... it is soon TM.

3823
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:22,360
Soon TM.

3824
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:25,720
I don't have really have any updates other than the last time I showed it.

3825
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:27,340
Sean thank you for the magenta suit.

3826
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:28,340
Thank you.

3827
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:28,860
Thank you.

3828
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:30,020
It was a great game.

3829
02:06:30,140 --> 02:06:30,880
It was funny.

3830
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:32,820
Especially the dear Fomia.

3831
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:34,180
Thank you for the super chat.

3832
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:35,500
Thank you for the magenta suit.

3833
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:36,700
Thank you.

3834
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:37,300
Thank you.

3835
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:38,560
I really appreciate it.

3836
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:38,980
Thank you.

3837
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:40,820
But yeah I think like right now...

3838
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:41,300
Osai!

3839
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:42,580
Welcome to the TM!

3840
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:44,870
Welcome!

3841
02:06:46,490 --> 02:06:47,390
Thank you!

3842
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:49,470
Thank you for joining Osai.

3843
02:06:49,790 --> 02:06:52,770
I hope you had a great time being paranoid now.

3844
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:55,710
Now you trust me less.

3845
02:06:56,890 --> 02:07:00,210
I could be right behind you right now.

3846
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:02,970
I could be right behind you right now.

3847
02:07:03,890 --> 02:07:04,390
Um...

3848
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:05,410
Um...

3849
02:07:05,410 --> 02:07:06,910
What was I saying?

3850
02:07:07,130 --> 02:07:09,730
Oh yeah I think the hardest part about...

3851
02:07:09,730 --> 02:07:18,810
Also like the reason why I've been like trying to like reach out to as many different people as possible to collab is that I want to try and find like...

3852
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:22,030
I want to have like a consistent group to have.

3853
02:07:22,350 --> 02:07:27,190
And so like if I ever want to do more group collabs I can easily like hit people up for it.

3854
02:07:27,270 --> 02:07:29,670
Because there's a lot of group games I really really want to do.

3855
02:07:29,770 --> 02:07:34,470
Like I want to do like Trouble in Terrace Town again and stuff like that.

3856
02:07:34,610 --> 02:07:47,450
So I want to like get to know as many people as possible in the community and um... and cause like you know it's harder as an indie I think to have a consistent group of people to play with.

3857
02:07:47,670 --> 02:07:51,910
And a consistent group of people to like hit up and stuff to play.

3858
02:07:52,170 --> 02:08:03,890
And like the thing is I have a lot of people I know and a lot of people I'm friends with outside uh like not just like in the indie VTuber scene not just in the VTuber scene but like outside the VTuber scene.

3859
02:08:04,070 --> 02:08:07,830
But like the risky part is like mixing that group of people.

3860
02:08:08,070 --> 02:08:17,330
So like I always try to keep it consistent like oh like VTuber collabs and then collabs outside mix collabs and stuff like that.

3861
02:08:17,470 --> 02:08:22,590
So um and like uh...

3862
02:08:23,070 --> 02:08:34,430
I try to expand my network and meet as many people as possible so I can have like consistent people I wanna do collabs with or like wanna do group games with cause like there's so many fun multiplayer games that I really really wanna do.

3863
02:08:34,630 --> 02:08:39,230
And um... I wanna have like a group of like people I can hit up on easily.

3864
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:40,530
Be like you wanna do this game?

3865
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:41,350
You wanna do that game?

3866
02:08:41,710 --> 02:08:47,830
Um so a lot of people I'm like interacting with for the first time or like uh haven't interacted really much before.

3867
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:49,470
Never had a chance to do collab with.

3868
02:08:49,670 --> 02:08:52,670
So it's a lot... my social battery

3869
02:08:58,670 --> 02:09:00,330
I'm trying my best.

3870
02:09:00,510 --> 02:09:01,470
I'm trying my best.

3871
02:09:01,530 --> 02:09:01,870
I'm trying my best.

3872
02:09:01,870 --> 02:09:01,870
I'm trying my best.

3873
02:09:01,870 --> 02:09:04,410
Anyway I'm gonna read like three more super chats and then I'm gonna call it here.

3874
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:06,730
Because I need to rest my voice for tomorrow.

3875
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:08,690
Cause we do have a stream tomorrow.

3876
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:10,970
Um... let's see.

3877
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:12,650
Uh oh yeah by the way.

3878
02:09:12,770 --> 02:09:20,410
By the way um... Tempo confirmed to me that because I made it to the finals I can't participate in the other tournaments.

3879
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:22,670
I only go straight to the final tournament.

3880
02:09:23,070 --> 02:09:23,930
I'm like no!

3881
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:29,530
I'm like I was like I should have threw but then I like bracket I'm joking.

3882
02:09:31,690 --> 02:09:37,370
I was like I should have I should have threw my game bracket I'm joking bracket.

3883
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:45,360
I was like no!

3884
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:47,460
I really wanted to do the third.

3885
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:49,320
I really wanted to do the third one.

3886
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:51,180
The third one looked so fun.

3887
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:53,340
But the finals they have it too.

3888
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:53,920
No!

3889
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:54,900
The free money!

3890
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:01,360
But were you serious about joking?

3891
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:04,680
Nami thank you for the super chat.

3892
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:05,280
Thank you thank you.

3893
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,300

3894
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:08,280

3895
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:09,020
Thank you thank you.

02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:09,900
I really appreciate it.

3897
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:13,040
I always get like a lot of anxiety right before the collab.

3898
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:19,980
Um because like obviously like when I'm collabing people... even if it's like with people I'm like used to collabing with.

3899
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:22,500
Like if it's like a ditto collab or something like that.

3900
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:25,300
I still get a lot of anxiety right before like an hour before the collab.

3901
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:32,120
I just need you guys to know when I woke up I ate lunch and then I took a four hour nap right before the stream.

3902
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:34,200
I really woke up at like 4.30.

3903
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,980
I was so stressed out.

3904
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:38,860
I was just like really tired.

3905
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:43,000
I was just like alright wake up food.

3906
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:43,960
Oh wait brush teeth.

3907
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:44,660
Food.

3908
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:45,760
And then I was like

3909
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:52,700
And then I was like okay.

3910
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:56,960
And then my dad was like Doki!

3911
02:10:57,380 --> 02:10:58,300
It's 4.

3912
02:10:58,360 --> 02:10:59,920
It's 4.40!

3913
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:00,800
Wake up!

3914
02:11:01,120 --> 02:11:02,820
I was like okay.

3915
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:08,020
I did it.

3916
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:09,240
I did it.

3917
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:10,180
I did it.

3918
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:17,960
I always get really nervous because the thing about collabs is that versus a solo stream is that you can't control what happens in a collab.

3919
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:19,720
You don't know what's gonna happen.

3920
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:22,000
You don't know what the chemistry is gonna be like.

3921
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:24,900
Especially with people you don't you've never played with before.

3922
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:28,060
So it's more so like oh you don't know what the chemistry is gonna be like.

3923
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:33,360
You don't know what the what the what the game is gonna be like.

3924
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:35,220
If it's a new game you've never played with before.

3925
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:36,460
And all that stuff.

3926
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:39,220
So I always get super anxious right before the collab.

3927
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:41,400
I know it doesn't look like it.

3928
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:43,560
Like you know fake it till you make it.

3929
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:44,780
That's like my whole thing.

3930
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,060
My entire streaming career.

3931
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:53,420
has been majority fake it till you make it.

3932
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:58,300
Cause like people don't know I'm an introvert when I first started.

3933
02:11:58,540 --> 02:12:01,700
And it's like no I'm a full on introvert.

3934
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:05,120
But like I'm very good at faking it.

3935
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:12,020
So yeah.

3936
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,540
Anyway I'm gonna go call it here guys.

3937
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:17,820
As always everybody stay hydrated.

3938
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:18,940
Posture check.

3939
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:20,760
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3940
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:24,260
And if you stayed up for me head to bed cause you deserve it.

3941
