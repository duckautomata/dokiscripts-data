1
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,100
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,420
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm slowly waking up because, like you guys know, it is a 12.30 stream, so I'm very tired.

4
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,900
I'm always tired in the morning.

5
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,000
Alright, story time!

6
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,300
Okay, you saw me react already on the chat, but like...

7
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,960
Okay, so like, I actually got really worried.

8
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,300
So like, the last couple of days...

9
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,780
Doki Amber Doge was like, not really into his food.

10
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,560
And I got really concerned because I was like, Oh no, is he getting sick?

11
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:29,440
So like, over the last couple of days, he was eating his food less and less enthusiastic.

12
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,460
And then, um, so he was just like... He was just like, he's just like, you know, he was like...

13
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,980
And then, okay, I should've got this as message yesterday.

14
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,220
Because like, I fed him yesterday for dinner.

15
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,280
And I fed him, and then he suddenly walked over to my door.

16
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,480
And he was like...

17
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,440
And I was like, why?

18
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,620
Like, I just fed you.

19
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,580
And I was so confused.

20
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,460
I was like...

21
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,800
Why are you angry at me?

22
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,340
So I walked out, because I was like, oh, maybe I need to refill his water.

23
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,680
Did I forget to refill his water?

24
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,160
Like, the automatic water dispenser was empty now.

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,460
So I walked over...

26
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:28,900
And then, I was like, and then he like, went to his food, looked at the food, looked at me, and started eating the rest of his food.

27
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,380
Because he wasn't eating it, he just... I walked over, and then he just started eating the rest of his food.

28
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,700
So I was like, oh, okay.

29
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,480
Maybe he was just feeling weird today.

30
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,200
He was just feeling a little quirky.

31
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,380
I was just like, oh, maybe he just wants a little attention.

32
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,620
That's why.

33
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,060
And then I went back to my PC.

34
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,380
I was like, maybe he just wants a little attention from me.

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,180
And I just went back to my PC to get back to work.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,180
And then, and then...

37
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:10,260
And so, today, I was like, I was really worried today.

38
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:19,860
Because I fed him this morning, and then he had no reaction to his food this morning.

39
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,160
And I was so scared, because I was like, oh my god, why isn't he eating?

40
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,980
I was like, he has zero, he doesn't even go to his, he doesn't even go to his like, little bowl when I put food in it.

41
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,420
And, um, so then like, I got worried.

42
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,380
And I was like, oh, maybe he's just not, maybe he's like, maybe he's just trying to sunbathe, and he's not that hungry.

43
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,200
He just wants to relax a little more.

44
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,020
Like, I don't know, I was so tired.

45
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,000
He like, he didn't even wake me up.

46
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,320
The thing is, he didn't even wake me up in the morning to demand to be fed today.

47
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,420
Which was already weird, because he usually wakes me up in the morning to be like, FEED ME!

48
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,280
FEED ME!

49
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:10,820
And I would like, you know, I would begrudgingly wake up and like, feed him early in the morning, because I am whipped as fuck by my dog.

50
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,380
But he didn't do it.

51
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:22,020
So I like, you know, naturally woke up and saw him just like, sunbathing, like, um, in the living room.

52
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,540
And then he, and I fed him, and I went back to bed.

53
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,920
Like, I went back to bed.

54
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,060
And, uh, and then so like, and then I woke up at a more, you know, more natural time.

55
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,500
Like, you know, like 12 p.m.

56
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,020
I woke up, 12 p.m.

57
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,280
And I was like, alright, it's, it's, uh, okay, then, who am I kidding?

58
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,560
I didn't instantly go like, walkies time.

59
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:54,000
I laid in bed for 20 minutes, and, no, sorry, I laid in bed for 15 minutes, and then I was like, walkie time, walk, walk.

60
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,800
And I saw that, I saw that the food bowl was still full.

61
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,220
So I got really concerned.

62
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,580
I was like, oh my god, are you sick?

63
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:12,460
Like, like, you are the most food motivated motherfucker, like, dog I've ever owned.

64
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,720
So like, I was like, oh my god, is my dog sick?

65
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,860
Like, you're so food motivated, I don't understand.

66
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,360
Like, why is, why does this bowl still have food?

67
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:35,560
And then, so I was like, texting my friends, because I was freaking out, while I was on the walk too, because I was like, I have stream in 20 minutes, I was like, I have stream in 10 minutes.

68
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:44,000
I was like, texting my friends about this, while I was walking in, because I was trying to multitask, because I was like, oh, I have a stream in 10 minutes, oh fuck, okay, I need to figure this out.

69
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,480
I need to figure this out.

70
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:59,540
So, I was texting them, and then I was like, and while I was texting them, I was also Googling, I was like, oh, I left my dog food bag open for like, I think a week and a half now.

71
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,920
I was like, is that the reason why?

72
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,180
Like, is that, I like, left it open for a week and a half, is that why?

73
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,480
Because I know it's supposed to be sealed, but like, I, there were so many things going on, I forgot to seal it.

74
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,620
And every time, I was like, okay, I'm gonna seal it this time.

75
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:22,060
And then, so like, it's dry dog food, so I didn't realize, usually I would put it in a little box thing, like those like, dispensers.

76
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,820
So I was like, oh man, Bibi, is that the reason why?

77
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:39,440
And then, so like, so like, I do, I usually have those big plastic containers, but, um, but like, I recently opened this big dog bag, because he finished his old one.

78
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,060
And, oh, not recent, but like, the last week and a half, I didn't close it, because I was so tired.

79
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:53,260
I've been really tired lately, so like, I would just put my scooper in there, and then scoop it out from that, because like, it was too heavy.

80
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,880
It was like those giant bags, too.

81
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,760
It was like the biggest ones.

82
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:04,560
And like, and I was too, I couldn't, I can't lift it and pour it into the plastic container, because it was so, um, it was so big.

83
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:13,700
And then, so like, I was just like, so I just grab a scooper and just scoop it, and, but I just left the bag open.

84
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:28,440
And, um, and so like, I didn't realize dry food can, I didn't realize dog dry, because I Googled it, and then like, I was like, can dry dog food go stale?

85
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,680
Or like, I was like, can, I left, left dry dog food bag open.

86
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:43,920
I Googled it, and then, um, and then like, and then the Google was like, it can go stale and moldy.

87
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,060
And I was like,

88
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:59,500
I was like, I didn't, I was like, I

89
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,460
didn't know dry dog food,

90
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,300
you're supposed to, I was like,

91
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,850
oh my god.

92
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,630
So, so like, I don't know if the food is moldy, but it's definitely stale.

93
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:46,150
I, yeah, it's, it's definitely, um, it's definitely stale.

94
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:53,270
And so I was, I, I, I was like, oh, so I came back home.

95
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:00,670
Um, I came back home, and then like, I was just like, you know, I grabbed the dog food, and it was hard.

96
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,650
It was harder than it should be.

97
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:09,630
And then I like, I like, and then I was like, okay, and then my friends was like, try and give him treats and see if he, if he's eating.

98
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,030
And then I got the dog treats, like, you know, the sealed dog treats.

99
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:24,830
I, I, I gave the, the, the, the sealed dog treats, and then like, he like, I like, and then he instantly gobbled up.

100
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,690
He was like, I was like, oh, I'm so sorry.

101
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:40,130
And then, and then I picked up the dog, one piece of the dog food, and I gave it to him, and then he just sniffed it.

102
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,990
And he sniffed it, put it, he sniffed it, put it in his mouth, and then spit it out.

103
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,610
And I was like, I'm so sorry.

104
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,630
Oh my god, and he's like, and he just sniffs it, and he's like, nope, and then, bleh.

105
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,850
Right after the treats, because he thought it was another treat.

106
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,850
Oh my god.

107
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,950
I was like, oh my god, I didn't know.

108
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,090
I'm so sorry.

109
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,950
I didn't, I didn't know.

110
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:23,330
I thought because it was dry, it'd be okay, but I didn't know it could come still.

111
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,270
I thought I didn't know.

112
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,670
It was the first time I actually left a bag open, too.

113
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,750
Okay, but like, it's my, it is my fault.

114
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,130
I left it open for a week and a half.

115
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,290
I was going through a lot, so I was just like, oh, it can't be that bad.

116
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,250
And then now I, I don't know, I lost a lot of money now.

117
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,750
Because I, I bought those giant ass fucking bags, too.

118
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:58,630
So like, so like, it was even halfway done, and so I need to buy, I need to go and buy, buy like, another bag of dog food for him.

119
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:06,250
And then this time I will remember to seal the bag, to seal the bag next time so it doesn't go stale.

120
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,750
I, I was like, I didn't know.

121
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:20,350
I, I thought last night when he was parking at me and I thought, I don't know, I thought he wanted attention.

122
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,610
I didn't realize he was yelling at me for giving him shit food.

123
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:32,190
I, I didn't, I didn't know that's why he was yelling at me.

124
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,110
He gave me a warning.

125
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,430
He still ate the food last night, but he was, that was his last straw.

126
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:50,930
He was like, he was like, you know, I'll, because I like you, I'll still finish this food, but like, this is the last straw.

127
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,190
I'll eat it, but I'm still mad.

128
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,610
And then today he was like, did I not warn you?

129
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,910
Did I not tell you that, that this is not food anymore?

130
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:14,410
This morning he was, this morning he was just like, I thought I told you.

131
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,570
Oh my God.

132
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,310
Oh, I'm so sorry.

133
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,130
I learned something new today.

134
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,770
I, I, I learned something new.

135
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,930
I, I do have the plastic container.

136
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,290
It was just so heavy.

137
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,170
I, it was a lot.

138
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,430
It was like the big dog food bags.

139
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:42,350
Like I bought the biggest one because in my mind, I was like, oh, if I buy the biggest one, I don't need to buy a refill later on.

140
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,470
So like, I couldn't fill the plastic container cause I can't fucking pick it up.

141
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,970
I had like my Uber driver bring the dog food bag.

142
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:58,930
I was like, if you, if you help me, if you help me bring it up to my apartment, I'll give you a tip.

143
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,610
So he brought the dog food bag up for me.

144
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:12,150
So I was just like, oh my God.

145
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,850

155
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:25,930
Thank you.

156
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,730
Thank you.

157
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,910
I didn't know!

158
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,460
I should have known food can go stale.

159
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:42,300
I, I don't know why I had like, um, I had like dog food as its own unique category.

160
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,020
I was like, of course food can go stale.

161
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:52,980
But then for some reason in my head, I saw like dry dog food as this like magical substance that could never go stale.

162
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,800
Like I was like, I was like, there's no way.

163
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,560
It's like magic food.

164
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,740
I've never, I've never heard about like dog, I don't know.

165
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,140
I just, I was like dogs will eat anything.

166
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,060
Like, you know, in my head I was like, dogs will eat anything.

167
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,120
There's no way it could go stale.

168
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,360
It's just, it's just, it's just dry food.

169
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,080
It's kibble.

170
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:28,640
Like, the fact that my very food motivated dog refused to eat it, I fucked up.

171
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,220
I, I, I would, I fucked up.

172
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,800
Like, you don't understand.

173
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,540
He is incredibly food motivated, but apparently he also has standards too.

174
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,020
So like, I was like, oh man.

175
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,260
So I learned something today.

176
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,380
Thank you for the super chat.

177
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,700
Thank you.

178
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,540
Thank you.

179
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,200
Thank you for using my art as your thumbnail.

180
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,280
It's worth drawing at 12am because I'm so hyped you're streaming this game.

181
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,440
I hope you liked it.

182
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,220
Thank you for the super chat.

183
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,460
Thank you.

184
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:58,820
Thank you.

185
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,260
Thank you for drawing such a lovely, um, artwork for just for this stream.

186
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,460
Um, I would always, I'd always love to use artwork that's themed towards the stream.

187
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,440
So I really appreciate it when artists like draw something in anticipation for a stream that I'm going to be doing.

188
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,760
So thank you so much.

189
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,260
I'm really happy to be using it.

190
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,500
Um, yeah, so, um, I gave him some treats.

191
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:26,840
So I hope that that will sustain his hunger for now until I'm able to like go buy him actual food after.

192
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,540
So yeah, that's update number one.

193
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,920
Update number two.

194
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm so fucking stupid because I didn't realize like, um, I didn't realize that like you don't need your passport to book like plane tickets and stuff.

195
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:49,780
So like, um, so like, uh, I was just like, oh yeah, I should like book some plane tickets to go somewhere.

196
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,660
And I won't say where.

197
00:16:52,620 --> 00:17:03,220
But like, anyway, so then, cause I had to get my passport and I realized, wait, I could have booked this ticket like months ago for cheaper.

198
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,560
And I was just like, um, and I was like, cause like, I was like, where do I put the passport number?

199
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,480
But then you could, you do it later after you pay for the ticket.

200
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,900
And I did, I was like, oh my God, I could have saved money.

201
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:23,840
I could have, oh my God, I could have, I could have saved money.

202
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,160
I felt so fucking stupid.

203
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,700
I was like, oh my God, I'm so, I'm so sad.

204
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,240
I didn't know.

205
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,280
It's like you can, I didn't realize like, oh my God.

206
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,980
Anyway, there's been a lot of girl fail lately.

207
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,240
I'm so sad.

208
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,900
I was like, why didn't anyone tell me this?

209
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,700
I was like, I was like, oh my God.

210
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,660
I could have got this plane ticket a thousand dollars cheaper.

211
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,640
And I was like, oh man, I can't get my passport.

212
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,260
I can't, I can't book this yet.

213
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,120
I have to wait until I get my passport and like pick it up.

214
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,400
And then I'm like.

215
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,520
Anyway, Astro, thank you for the super chat.

216
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:22,880
Thank you.

217
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,680
Thank you.

218
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
Dad food fund contribution.

219
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,280
Thank you for the super chat.

220
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,680
Thank you.

221
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,320
Thank you.

222
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,180
Anton, you owe him a steak for this.

223
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:31,540
Yes.

224
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,220
I, I, yeah, I should have known.

225
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,920
I, oh my God.

226
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,200
Like I was like, that's why I thought he was sick.

227
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,700
Cause he's like incredibly food motivated.

228
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,520
So when he like doesn't want to eat the food, like something is wrong.

229
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,040
I was like, oh my God.

230
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,820
Like you don't want to eat.

231
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,600
What's wrong?

232
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,300
I was like, are you dying?

233
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,360
I was so scared.

234
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
I was like, is my dog dying?

235
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,320
Like I was so, I don't know.

236
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,540
I did not know what to do.

237
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,640
All right.

238
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,020
What is this game window?

239
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,580
The heart, the weirdest part is that, oh, it's called windows.

240
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,140
Okay.

241
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,860
I like, it had a weird name for the screen.

242
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,100
Okay.

243
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,240
So let's play the game.

244
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,780
All right.

245
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,140
So needy streamer overload typing of the net.

246
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,220
So, oh my God, it's like I'm on an actual YouTube channel.

247
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,540
Oh my God.

248
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,240
All right.

249
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,500
So, oh, wait, it is search.

250
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,020
Doki bird.

251
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,980
Is there a Doki bird streamer in here?

252
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,740
I guess not.

253
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,460
I don't, I don't exist on this channel.

254
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,200
All right.

255
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,820
So apparently this is a spinoff of needy streamer overload typing of the net.

256
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,200
Oh, sorry.

257
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,660
It's called, it's a, I'm sorry.

258
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,920
My brain is like so frazzled right now after dealing with the goddamn panic thinking my dog was dying.

259
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
I was like so fucking scared.

260
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:04,940
And then I went through like three to four different spans of emotions within like 15 to 20 minutes.

261
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,180
Cause I was like trying to figure out what the fuck is going on with my dog.

262
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,300
And I'm like, my mind is like incredibly frazzled right now.

263
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,260
I was just like, I was so, so scared.

264
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,380
And then later I was like, oh, oh man, it was my fault.

265
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,540
I'm so sorry.

266
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,920
I'm so sorry.

267
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,680
You warned me yesterday.

268
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,720
You fucking warned me.

269
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,240
You're like, you gave me this shit.

270
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,660
If I didn't know, I thought you just wanted attention.

271
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,500
Orca, thank you for the super chat.

272
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:43,820
Thank you.

273
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,480
Thank you.

274
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
Doki, it is Orca day.

275
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,500
Can I get a, can an Orca get a big happy Orca day?

276
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,980
And fandom leave happy Orca day.

277
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,440
Yahoo.

278
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,060
Thank you for the super chat, Orca.

279
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,480
Thank you.

280
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,140
Thank you.

281
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,720
All right.

282
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,640
Happy birthday to you.

283
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,700
Happy birthday to you.

284
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,720
Happy birthday, dear Orca.

285
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,560
Happy birthday to you.

286
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,020
Yeah, happy birthday.

287
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,440
Happy birthday to you.

288
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,020
Also, Johnny, Kush, and Han, thank you for the 10, 15 gifted ships.

289
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,380
Thank you.

290
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:14,860
Thank you.

291
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:22,780
So apparently this is a typing game, but like I did read the reviews and I found, cause like people were like, oh no, unsubscribe.

292
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,600
Um, I'm a lurk.

293
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:32,720
Did you know that like 30% of you guys aren't subscribed to my, I actually don't know this actual statistic.

294
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,840
But you know how like YouTubers were like, look at this graph.

295
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,380
30% of you aren't subscribed.

296
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,300
So press that subscribe button right now.

297
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,640
Well, like Nidistreamer, I don't know.

298
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,160
What's her name?

299
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,760
KaAngel.

300
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,840
It's been so long since I played Nidistreamer Overload.

301
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,940
But like, um, KaAngel has not impressed me yet.

302
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:58,420
She only has one video and like, um, I don't subscribe until like I see what her actual real personality is.

303
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:07,760
You know, you know how like, um, debut videos are not their real personalities until like, like, you know, debut me was so different from me now.

304
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,000
She just, yeah.

305
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,200
So I need like, I need two to three more videos until like I figure out who she, if she could be my Oshi.

306
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,060
Alright.

307
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,380
That's true.

308
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,420
That's, that's true.

309
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,340
Oh my gosh, my head.

310
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,140
Alright.

311
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,900
Hey, hey cuties.

312
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,200
Hello, it's KaAngel, your favorite tippy typing angel.

313
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,240
Guess what we're doing today.

314
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,800
We're exploring internet slang together.

315
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,320
Now get your keyboard ready and work those fingers.

316
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
It's gonna be super epic.

317
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:42,640
Ready?

318
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,700
Oh my god, wait.

319
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:44,980
Hater?

320
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,780
Nice.

321
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,840
Why do I have any?

322
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,160
I've never done anything wrong.

323
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,960
Geez, why was everyone so random and obs... what?

324
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,920
Coin, coin, some things.

325
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,680
Rule, excuse me?

326
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,120
Rule 34?

327
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,540
Lurker?

328
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,140
Someone reads post but rarely on, never post.

329
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,300
What?

330
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,300
Wait, what's this?

331
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,480
Khamij?

332
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,680
Eternal goat.

333
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,620
Okay.

334
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,220
Um, what am I learning?

335
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,980
What?

336
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,960
What am I?

337
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,180
Oh my god.

338
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,140
I can't even like, figure.

339
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,220
I can't even, I can't register the stuff I'm typing.

340
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,700
What happens when I see a smexy?

341
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,780
Stop?

342
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, stop it.

343
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,900
Solo YOLO?

344
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,340
What are these new terms?

345
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,740
Am I getting old?

346
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,800
Geez.

347
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,440
Or like, are they like, stuff that like, older people are putting in this game?

348
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,040
She just like for, she's just like me for real.

349
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,620
For real, for real.

350
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,220
Oh, the faster I type, the more viewers she gets.

351
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:56,220
All for my oshi, all your... Okay, this is definitely some old guy that... I'm sorry, I'm not old.

352
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,660
That is definitely old internet slang.

353
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,660
Uh...

354
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Well then, let's take it up a notch.

355
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,140
Alright, you can handle it, right?

356
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,440
I mean, that's really easy.

357
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,380
Keep up or you're gonna get pwned.

358
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,200
Skill issue?

359
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,880
That can't be me.

360
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,720
Something I would never have...

361
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,840
True kai angel.

362
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:42,740
I remember when that was a thing for conventions, and like, people actually broke their bones, cause like, random stranger would like, glomp each other out of nowhere.

363
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,540
And then so like, glomping became banned in conventions.

364
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,260
Isn't that like, an old internet term?

365
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,620
Normies have money!

366
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,820
Cause they have jobs!

367
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,660
How dare you?

368
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,060
I'm technically like, a normie.

369
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,040
It's more likely than you think.

370
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,520
Oh my God.

371
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,840
Mother of God.

372
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,920
It's hard to like, talk and like, she goes so fast.

373
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,740
Can't be me.

374
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,500
Oh my God, view count go up.

375
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,720
Vanity search?

376
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,400
Oh, everyday.

377
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,100
It's called ego searching.

378
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,320
My friends always tell me to stop ego searching.

379
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,280
They judge me every time.

380
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,400
I just go on Twitter and be like...

381
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,660
Recent tweets.

382
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,660
What's my score?

383
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,900
Oh nice, S.

384
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,720
Almost S rank.

385
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,700
Stop.

386
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,760
I told you guys, I read everything.

387
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,920
I read like, recent tweets.

388
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,660
I always see what you guys are trying to tweet out and post.

389
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,100
Alright, she still hasn't impressed me yet, guys.

390
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,420
I don't know, I don't know if I want to subscribe to her right now.

391
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:37,520
I'm still not impressed with her content enough to be a subscriber.

392
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,540
Alright, level 2.

393
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,140
Goat typing battle with Ca-Angel and those haters.

394
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,840
Nice.

395
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,920
Like... Oh God.

396
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,160
Okay.

397
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,220
I'm like going through like... Oh, this is like 2010.

398
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,980
Oh wait, did I die?

399
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,640
Okay guys, I should focus.

400
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,300
It won't even let me commentate!

401
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,300
She won't let me commentate!

402
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,700
She's like, I'm the streamer here.

403
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,000
Why are you talking to your chat?

404
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,900
This is my chat now.

405
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,320
Okay guys, actually, she won't let me commentate.

406
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,620
She won't let me do commentary.

407
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,400
I just have to focus up.

408
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,260
Alright, give me a sec.

409
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,400
I'm locking in, guys.

410
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,780
I'm locking in.

411
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,740
She won't be the better streamer.

412
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,000
Your argument...

413
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,280
She won't let me stream!

414
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,340
She won't let me be a streamer!

415
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,360
Okay, okay, okay.

416
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,100
I'm locking in.

417
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,980
I'm locking in.

418
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,800
Alright, let's fast forward this.

419
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Let's fast... She has... I can't even fast forward.

420
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,640
Alright, I'm locked in this time.

421
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,180
It's Kai Angel's stream now.

422
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,580
Alright, it's super fun.

423
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,720
IRC channel?

424
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,120
Wait, what's an IRC channel?

425
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,700
I feel old.

426
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,340
Wait, what is an IRC?

427
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,200
I actually don't know.

428
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,700
Ragebait?

429
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,180
That's what I do everyday.

430
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,560
No, sorry, those are Twitch... Those are some Twitch streamers.

431
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:47,900
Jilted?

432
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,640
I'm not.

433
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,120
Checky?

434
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,500
Oh, I know what Checky is.

435
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,340
Katasha?

436
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,140
Sage?

437
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,380
This feels so 2010 right now.

438
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,320
Some of these I recognize from like 20... Oh, oh, she!

439
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,020
That's me!

440
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,660
Just... According... To... Hikkaku.

441
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,180
What?!

442
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,500
Okay, I typed it in time.

443
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,180
Creepypasta.

444
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,850
That was... This is aging me.

445
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,920
Press F to pay respects.

446
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,860
I actually don't know what game that was originally for.

447
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,780
Mods are asleep.

448
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,340
Sage is like 2003.

449
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,480
I remember Sage from Neopets.

450
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,880
Let's take it up a notch.

451
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,760
You can handle this.

452
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,880
Keep up or you're gonna get pawned.

453
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,580
Wubi?

454
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,220
Wubi.

455
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,180
Yaoi paddle?

456
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,000
Oh, God.

457
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,200
Things I'm glad are not a thing anymore.

458
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,940
Ujoshi.

459
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,540
Not me.

460
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,760
That's not me, guys.

461
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,480
I swear to God.

462
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,700
Squee.

463
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,220
Leap.

464
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,880
Lolita.

465
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,360
That was my past, okay?

466
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,980
I will admit, that was my past, but I'm reformed.

467
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,800
I'm a reformed Fujo.

468
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,860
I discovered gaming.

469
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,180
Okay, on the internet.

470
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,000
That feel when... When I beat this game.

471
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,020
Shitposting.

472
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,960
Oh, that's what I do every day, honestly.

473
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,500
Even for, like, sponsoring.

474
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,420
Nice.

475
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,400
Wow, you're a lot better than I thought.

476
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,160
Pretty base and epic, in fact.

477
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,420
All that shitposting really popped off.

478
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,100
Oh, God.

479
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,120
You're so cringe, Kai Angel.

480
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,720
If I could, I might just block you instead.

481
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,800
Instead of subscribing to her, I might just block her.

482
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,360
What was it?

483
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,640
Do not recommend this channel.

484
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,370
Hey, cuties.

485
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,350
It's Kai Angel, your favorite angel.

486
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,370
Guess what we're doing today?

487
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,710
We're exploring internet slimes together.

488
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,950
Now, get your keyboard ready and work those fingers.

489
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,030
It's gonna be super epic and super fun.

490
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,610
Go, Lurkmore.

491
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,950
Do this before you post.

492
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,490
Oh, shit.

493
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,250
Oh, shit.

494
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:57,990
Oh, shit.

495
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,270
Okay.

496
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:58,910
Okay.

497
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,950
Guys, I can't.

498
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,370
She won't let me commentate anymore.

499
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,870
She won't let me be a streamer anymore.

500
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,770
Oh, it's so much faster.

501
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:05,230
Okay.

502
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,090
Alright.

503
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,830
I heard you like...

504
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,810
No, fuck!

505
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:12,770
Ah!

506
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,090
Oh, okay.

507
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:14,430
Okay.

508
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,070
I'm... okay.

509
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:16,990
We're fine.

510
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,110
I don't do well in pressure situations.

511
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:20,870
The laws...

512
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,850
Green text...

513
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:26,870
Pwned...

514
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,950
Oh, I'm locking in.

515
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,550
I'm locking in.

516
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,810
I'm pre-typing too now.

517
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,250
Problematic...

518
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,470
Can't be me.

519
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,090
I'm the most unproblematic fave.

520
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,110
It's...

521
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,550
Oh, and then you have to add numbers into a typing game!

522
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,130
Oh, what's this?

523
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,450
Alright, nice.

524
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,110
Forever alone.

525
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,290
Forever alone.

526
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,290
Is that it?

527
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,590
Not bad.

528
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,610
Not bad at all.

529
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,330
Well then, let's take it up a notch.

530
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,430
You can handle this, right?

531
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,950
Keep up or you're gonna get pwned.

532
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:12,990
Gotcha.

533
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,430
Okay.

534
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,890
Om nom nom.

535
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,130
Alright.

536
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:19,950
LARPing.

537
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,010
New achievers are the strongest.

538
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:23,790
Oh, shit.

539
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,490
Problem...

540
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,650
What's belated?

541
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,850
No, um, beli...

542
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,690
Oh, sh...

543
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:31,810
No!

544
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,650
I was... I wanted to know what...

545
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,790
I was so curious!

546
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,870
I was like, what is that word?

547
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,050
I...

548
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,570
I wanted to know what that word meant!

549
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,330
I actually wanted to learn!

550
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,110
I actually wanted to learn, guys.

551
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,330
I was like, belated?

552
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,670
The fuck is that?

553
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,070
I've never heard of that word before.

554
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,090
Okay.

555
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,350
Ready and super fun.

556
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,290
Oh, I'm sorry.

557
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,630
Oh, I can't even learn?

558
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,190
I thought this was learning about internet slang.

559
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,390
But it won't... she won't even let me learn.

560
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,490
She's like, just type this.

561
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,510
I'm like, yes, queen, I will.

562
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,170
Akimakura.

563
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,890
Oh, the one time I was like, I wonder what that means.

564
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:13,870
Noob.

565
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,170
Say so.

566
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:17,970
Me.

567
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,790
Oh, I know you are not...

568
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,370
Oh, really?

569
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,110
In before...

570
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,370
Wo... Wojack?

571
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,290
Wait, what's Wojack?

572
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,230
What's... what's Wojack?

573
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,430
Some of these are like, fucking terrible descriptions.

574
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,090
Doom scrolling.

575
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,250
Oh, I...

576
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,410
Twitter right now.

577
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,230
Problematic.

578
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,010
Problematic.

579
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,970
Zettai Ryukyai?

580
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,630
No...

581
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,790
I was so confused.

582
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,850
Words I don't know.

583
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:09,070
I was like, how to spell?

584
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,370
You can handle this, right?

585
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,650
Keep up, you're gonna get pwned, Yuri.

586
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,270
Means lily, but also...

587
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,490
Oh, shit.

588
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,430
Oh, shit.

589
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,850
Why was it that way?

590
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,230
Sorry, it like, threw me off.

591
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,330
The four letter word threw me off.

592
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,270
I was like, wait, excuse me?

593
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,770
I don't know why.

594
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,750
They're like, spell dealt and I...

595
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:53,270
I type every letter except for the right letters.

596
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,850
I was like, oh.

597
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,290
The cake is alive.

598
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,710
Good night.

599
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,590
Sweet prince.

600
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,790
Jesus Christ.

601
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,470
Alright, nice.

602
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,430
Notice me, senpai.

603
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,550
Alright.

604
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,330
Mom, holy fuck?

605
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,870
Kicks down the...

606
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh, that's the cadence meme.

607
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,730
Wow, you're a lot better than I thought.

608
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,570
Pretty based and epic, in fact.

609
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,230
All that shit posting really paid off.

610
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:30,970
Now go.

611
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,550
Sally Fork, my little internet explorer.

612
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,750
Show the sweet summer child who the goat poster is.

613
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:37,310
Bless.

614
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,230
Yay!

615
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,230
Okay, I will admit, I think it was the dill part that fucked me up.

616
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,490
Alright, streams...

617
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,710
Okay, I know streams not...

618
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,230
So, apparently, you guys might be thinking, that's it?

619
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,550
That's...

620
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,210
It's only a 37 minute game?

621
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,730
Do not leave.

622
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,870
Because I found out that...

623
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,630
There's actually more to this game.

624
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:04,570
So a lot...

625
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,030
I was reading it, because I was very surprised.

626
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,130
Because I was like, wow.

627
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,030
Why is there, like, mixed reviews?

628
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,110
And then people were like...

629
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,170
People were giving...

630
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,370
And I was reading the reviews.

631
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,210
So there were people like, this is too short.

632
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,230
I can't believe I paid $9 for three levels.

633
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,170
And...

634
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,470
And...

635
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,190
Okay, mostly it was a 10 minute game.

636
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,170
And so, like, people were like...

637
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,490
Oh, man.

638
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,950
Because I was getting worried.

639
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,630
I usually don't read reviews, if it's positive.

640
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,990
So I was like, oh, shit.

641
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,030
So, people...

642
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:41,550
People apparently didn't click Endless Nightmare at the end.

643
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,230
They didn't...

644
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,170
They didn't look at...

645
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,070
At the end, where it says Endless Nightmare.

646
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,170
And so people were like...

647
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,670
People just instantly closed the game and refunded it.

648
00:37:59,350 --> 00:37:59,830
And...

649
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,630
So...

650
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,470
Because I was wondering why it had negative reviews.

651
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,310
And that's the only reason when I...

652
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,250
That's the only reason I'll read reviews.

653
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,930
Because I'd be like, why is this game garbage?

654
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,890
Because I was confused.

655
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,230
Because it's Needy Girl Overdose.

656
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,470
Like, why the fuck would they release a 10 minute game?

657
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,010
So...

658
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,310
So, like...

659
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,310
So, in the reviews, people were like...

660
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,430
If you see negative reviews, they skipped the credits.

661
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,170
I was like, oh, okay.

662
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,030
That's interesting.

663
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,050
I was like, oh, okay.

664
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,450
They skipped the credits.

665
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,150
What do they mean by that?

666
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,010
Alright.

667
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,710
So, now...

668
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,150
Now, it's a platformer game.

669
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,570
Oh, you don't even see it.

670
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,670
Open a new browser.

671
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,850
Alright.

672
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,010
Anyway...

673
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:55,420
Now...

674
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,490
Now, it's an entirely new game that I'm playing.

675
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,410
Now, I'm playing a new game, guys.

676
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,350
Alright.

677
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,970
Let's see...

678
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,930
Windows size.

679
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,180
Actually, let's...

680
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,870
Let's make this bigger for my...

681
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,430
Fucking...

682
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,350
For my sake.

683
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,090
Alright, let's fix this.

684
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,270
Oh, my god.

685
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,110
Kai Angel.

686
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,770
I hate it when you have to make me change my resolution.

687
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,790
Alright.

688
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,370
So, yeah.

689
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,770
Now, we're playing a platformer game.

690
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,870
Game number two.

691
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,690
Now, this is epic like a boss.

692
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,470
Cas, thank you for the super chat.

693
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:41,890
Thank you.

694
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,910
Hello, Evo, Kai Angel.

695
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,310
So, yeah.

696
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,090
Now, I'm on the platformer game.

697
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,560
Hello.

698
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,960
Wait, I have a chainsaw?

699
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,280
Okay.

700
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,400
Alright.

701
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,720
Okay.

702
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,180
There's...

703
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,920
There's a projectile.

704
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:04,760
Alright.

705
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,400
I have...

706
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,560
I actually don't know what it really is about other than the fact that it's a platform...

707
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,180
Oh, my god!

708
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,640
Oh, jump.

709
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,400
Okay, thank you.

710
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,660
Alright.

711
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,800
Jumping.

712
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,120
Double jump.

713
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,820
Okay.

714
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,440
There's a double jump.

715
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,840
Apparently, this platformer is extremely hard, too.

716
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,700
Okay.

717
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,960
Jump goes through.

718
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,300
Nice.

719
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,500
Sis.

720
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,940
Slash, slash, slash.

721
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,480
Jade.

722
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,640
Go up by collecting items.

723
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:38,940
Drop.

724
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,280
But that's like the only thing I know so far about the second game.

725
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,580
The second hidden game.

726
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,480
Is there any sound?

727
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:50,980
There is.

728
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,920
It's just...

729
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,220
The only sound is me jumping and the slash.

730
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,170
Okay, nice.

731
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,210
Oop.

732
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,270
So easy.

733
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,050
I'm just gonna use my projectile.

734
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,530
Uh, throw a knife.

735
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:07,310
Dodge.

736
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,110
Oh, whoop.

737
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,470
The power's decreased if your gauge reduces.

738
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,550
Oh, shit!

739
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:11,870
Oops.

740
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,330
Whoops.

741
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,610
I didn't realize that that requires power.

742
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,230
Oopsie.

743
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,590
That's fine.

744
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,550
I have more power here.

745
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,230
Hello.

746
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,710
Hello, evil me.

747
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,470
Hello.

748
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,070
Oop.

749
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,530
But how is this platformer hard?

750
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,370
Why do people say this took a long time to beat?

751
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,850
Oh, no.

752
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,930
Use one unit of your gauge to heal?

753
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,270
Oh, it's like...

754
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,970
It's like Hollow Knight.

755
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,700
Hello?

756
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,800
Hello?

757
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,390
You're literally in the tutorial.

758
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,530
How many levels is there?

759
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,750
Stage 1?

760
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,330
How many levels is there?

761
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,470
Up the sound effects a little bit?

762
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:16,810
Okay.

763
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,570
I just need you to know there's like no option menu.

764
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,830
When you're in the...

765
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,510
When you're in the second game, there is...

766
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,010
Oh, shit.

767
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,030
Now they can do projectile.

768
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,930
Okay, that's a little bad.

769
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,610
Oh, that's where the...

770
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,430
Oh, what?

771
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,230
You touched me one time!

772
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,450
Oh.

773
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,050
It's fine.

774
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,290
Okay.

775
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,710
I don't want him getting near me.

776
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,210
Because apparently, like, even like a little poke can fuck me up.

777
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,490
Okay.

778
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,070
Oh, I can like...

779
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,950
I can slide.

780
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,370
Wait, it never taught me slide?

781
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:51,970
Dash.

782
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:55,830
Oh.

783
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,430
Wait, this is so much faster.

784
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,330
It never even taught me...

785
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:00,470
Oh.

786
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,310
Oh.

787
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,030
Oh.

788
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,890
Oh.

789
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,370
It's fine.

790
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,410
They're just little babies.

791
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,830
Nothing to worry about.

792
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:08,730
Look at that.

793
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,270
Just a little baby.

794
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,470
Can't even move.

795
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:12,470
Look at that.

796
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,710
You have no free will.

797
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:14,970
Look at you.

798
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,970
You're so weak.

799
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,750
Look at you.

800
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,390
I could literally just stay there and then up the volume of my game.

801
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,610
Alright, I upped it a little bit.

802
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,070
This is a boss fight?

803
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,850
I can literally just stay there and up the volume.

804
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:40,870
What's this?

805
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,530
I have like a shirt at the bottom right.

806
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,270
But it hasn't told me what it is yet.

807
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:44,730
Whoa!

808
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,210
Secret!

809
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:46,790
Oh, there it is.

810
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,630
Okay, I got the shirt.

811
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:49,830
There's the shirt.

812
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,450
What the heck is this shirt?

813
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,470
I don't want to use it.

814
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,530
Because it didn't tell me what it does.

815
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,440
Okay.

816
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,200
I'm just worried about my shirt.

817
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,460
Is it collectible?

818
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,000
What happens if I click it?

819
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,840
Oh, it doesn't do it.

820
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,760
Oh, it is a collectible.

821
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,880
I thought if I click it, something would happen.

822
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,380
Alright.

823
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,800
How do I...

824
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,580
Wait, how do I get my health back?

825
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,600
How do I get my health back?

826
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,620
Is this like...

827
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,220
You can use your gauge?

828
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,900
Wait, what?

829
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,840
What do I press?

830
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,820
What do I press to hold E?

831
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,240
Oh, it's E!

832
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,580
Okay, it's E.

833
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:46,730
Alright.

834
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,710
Oh.

835
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,250
That's easy.

836
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,030
Is there a secret on the other side?

837
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,390
Why is it like that?

838
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,070
No?

839
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:55,490
What?

840
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,650
There's not even a secret on the other side.

841
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:02,870
Hello?

842
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,520
Oh, shit!

843
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,680
It's a cat!

844
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,080
Hello, cat.

845
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:10,880
Oh!

846
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:11,980
Oh, it's an evil cat!

847
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,020
It's an evil cat!

848
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,080
Oh, is he dead?

849
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:16,940
Oh!

850
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:17,200
Oh!

851
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:17,540
Oh!

852
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,020
No!

853
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,100
Wait, I can just tank this.

854
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,420
Wait, I can just tank this.

855
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:25,740
Oh!

856
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,220
Hardest boss fight of my goddamn life!

857
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,460
Oh my God, this is so hard!

858
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,820
Proceed, please.

859
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,440
Just face tank it.

860
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,960
That's my...

861
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,800
That's how I play every game.

862
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,580
Stage 2.

863
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,960
Okay, so there's five stages.

864
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,300
Hello, cat!

865
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,740
Jada charge...

866
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,060
Oh.

867
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:53,580
Okay.

868
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:56,940
Wait, what?

869
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,480
Oh!

870
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,600
Okay.

871
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,420
Alright, so now I have a charge attack.

872
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,120
What's this?

873
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,400
Touch the glowing wall while charging up to climb it?

874
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,340
Oh my gosh.

875
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,360
Oh, it's like...

876
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,340
Oh, that's so cool!

877
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,040
Okay, I like these new mechanics.

878
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,040
Up I go.

879
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,760
Up I go.

880
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,260
Oh, I can damage people too.

881
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,020
Up I go.

882
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,480
What are you gonna do?

883
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,120
Kill me?

884
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,220
Oh, wait, this is so broken!

885
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,120
I can literally just do that.

886
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,700
Oh, shit!

887
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,400
Never mind.

888
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,260
I shouldn't do that.

889
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,600
That's actually a waste of my power-ups.

890
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,920
Hey, I would be a Mega Man now.

891
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,040
Oh, shit.

892
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,080
While climbing, hold and then when I move in, jump to the other side.

893
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,800
Oh, wall climb.

894
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,560
Wall jumps.

895
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,460
Okay, this way.

896
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,900
Oh, this is like...

897
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,720
Not as smooth as I think it is.

898
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,880
Yeah, there's like low damage for the wall climb shit.

899
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,120
Like...

900
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,780
The damage is not that high for when you're walking up.

901
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,540
But it's really high when you're...

902
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,800
It's really high during wall climbing.

903
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,760
Not during the actual fight itself.

904
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,580
Crouch while jump.

905
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,220
Charging up to move quickly.

906
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,060
While you're moving quickly, hold where direction and press to long jump.

907
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:31,340
Oh!

908
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,740
Oh, my god!

909
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,240
I'm so fucking fast!

910
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:36,780
Oh, shit!

911
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,080
Okay.

912
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,520
I'm not used to it.

913
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,320
I'm not used to how fast I'm moving.

914
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:43,420
Wait.

915
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:44,900
There we go.

916
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,840
God, fuck.

917
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,100
Okay.

918
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,220
No.

919
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:49,920
Please.

920
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,300
Okay.

921
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,320
Okay, nice.

922
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,300
Oh, my god.

923
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,000
This is not...

924
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,620
I can't.

925
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,880
This is not natural for me.

926
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,180
It's not natural.

927
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,360
God damn it!

928
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:04,640
Okay.

929
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,920
Okay, I can do this.

930
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,100
It's just...

931
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,960
It's just not natural.

932
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,720
It's just not natural.

933
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,820
I'm like so disoriented.

934
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,360
Okay.

935
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,100
And then...

936
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,140
God damn it.

937
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,280
Please.

938
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,220
Be that secret.

939
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,040
Okay.

940
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,080
Okay.

941
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,440
This tech is weird.

942
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,780
This is a very weird tech.

943
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,700
Are you serious?

944
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,600
How am I not making that jump?

945
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:36,580
Alright.

946
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,300
I got this.

947
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,520
I just need more momentum.

948
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:39,680
Right here.

949
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,340
Okay.

950
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,300
Alright.

951
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,080
I need a whole jump.

952
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,900
I need to do a double jump.

953
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,220
Okay.

954
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,100
Here we go.

955
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:52,820
I got the momentum.

956
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,800
Nice.

957
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,540
Okay, I did it.

958
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,380
First try.

959
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,040
I keep forgetting to double jump.

960
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,340
It's so hard.

961
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,460
You guys don't understand.

962
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,140
Okay.

963
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,100
Okay, nevermind.

964
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,720
I think I do not like this mechanic.

965
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,980
I'm so sorry.

966
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,420
Guys, can you tell I'm not a platform player?

967
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,720
Guys, is it noticeable?

968
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,020
Is it noticeable, guys?

969
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,160
Guys, is it...

970
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,220
Don't laugh.

971
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,260
Is it...

972
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,860
No, right?

973
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,760
Because I'm such a fucking gamer.

974
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,960
It's not right, guys.

975
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,520
Okay.

976
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,520
Okay.

977
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,680
Okay, give me a sec.

978
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,020
I need to figure out how to get up here now.

979
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:53,780
Okay.

980
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,320
Oh, I figured it out.

981
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,520
Oh my god.

982
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,800
No!

983
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,500
Please!

984
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,040
Please!

985
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,500
I am...

986
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,520
You nice?

987
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,920
Oh my god.

988
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,520
Please!

989
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,820
Okay, I just...

990
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,380
I don't know why my mind isn't, like, alive.

991
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,520
My mind isn't...

992
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,940
My mind doesn't know what to do.

993
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,320
My mind doesn't know what to do in wall jumps.

994
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:24,880
I died.

995
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,640
Okay.

996
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,620
Okay.

997
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,000
Okay, we did it.

998
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,020
We did it.

999
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,320
We fucking did it.

1000
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,760
I hope there's not more of this part.

1001
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,500
Oh man, it'll be so unfortunate the game adds more.

1002
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,820
No, man, think about 20 gifted ships they could take you.

1003
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,700
That would be so unfortunate.

1004
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,260
Oh hey, there's another heart.

1005
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,020
Oh, it's a bunny.

1006
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,780
Can I face tank you too?

1007
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,200
Oh no.

1008
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,120
Oh no.

1009
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,540
Oh no, don't do this to me.

1010
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,920
Oh no.

1011
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,860
Does this hurt me?

1012
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,680
No, we're fine.

1013
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,880
Don't do this to me.

1014
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:08,720
Okay, nice.

1015
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,640
It's not that hard.

1016
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,420
Okay, he just shoots the ray and the center.

1017
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,740
And with my speed, it'll be okay.

1018
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,800
Slow and steady wins the race, guys.

1019
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,800
Slow and steady.

1020
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,100
Oh shit.

1021
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:32,440
Guys, slow and steady wins the race.

1022
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,180
Okay, let's go.

1023
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,100
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

1024
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,240
Thank God.

1025
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,420
No!

1026
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,120
Okay,

1027
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,060
I figured it out.

1028
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,680
I figured it out.

1029
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,420
Alright, just one more hit.

1030
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,680
Oh shit, what?

1031
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,360
How does this go?

1032
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,360
Okay.

1033
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,960
Okay, okay, give me a sec.

1034
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,620
I'm downloading.

1035
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,760
I'm downloading this right now.

1036
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,320
Give me a sec.

1037
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:13,780
Okay.

1038
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,380
God damn it!

1039
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,020
I'm just gonna tank this.

1040
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,660
I have enough HP.

1041
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,440
Alright, nice.

1042
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:27,940
We did it.

1043
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,960
Yo, human versus gravity.

1044
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,340
I just... I don't know.

1045
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,360
My brain just can't fucking comprehend.

1046
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,080
It just doesn't comprehend wall riding for some reason.

1047
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,240
Like, it's like... My brain is like, this is unnatural.

1048
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,340
This is a work against physics.

1049
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,400
And I'm like, you're right.

1050
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,200
That's how... I'm like, you're so right, brain.

1051
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,940
That's actually unnatural.

1052
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,900
Physics should not work there.

1053
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:01,370
Anyway.

1054
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,250
Oh, I have to...

1055
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,470
Close the eyes.

1056
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,130
And then go here.

1057
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,350
Can I use my chainsaw for it?

1058
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,190
Or... Yeah, I can.

1059
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:15,690
Okay, I didn't want to waste my...

1060
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,770
I didn't want to waste my...

1061
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,610
My power move here.

1062
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:22,910
My range.

1063
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,050
If I can just use the chainsaw.

1064
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:26,790
Hello there.

1065
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,630
Hello there, you unnatural freak.

1066
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,050
Yay, I fly now.

1067
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,830
At least they give me this instead.

1068
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,110
Okay, that's fine.

1069
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,590
I don't mind killing them while they're in the air.

1070
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,650
I'll just face tank it, as always.

1071
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:48,330
Like, they just do one damage, so I'm not scared.

1072
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,130
I thought this game was about typing.

1073
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:53,730
Oh, you didn't look at the... Me too.

1074
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,250
I was just so excited about a typing game too.

1075
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:57,790
But like... Oh, hey.

1076
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,310
Did it actually hurt me this time?

1077
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,350
Wait, what?

1078
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,730
Oh, it's like a...

1079
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,370
I don't know, I feel like...

1080
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,930
I might play Typing of the Dead in the future.

1081
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,170
Because I actually really like typing games.

1082
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:17,390
But then I realized it's so hard to talk while you type.

1083
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:22,530
Like, she barely let me try and commentate because she's like, I'm the streamer here.

1084
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,110
Kat Angel doesn't even let me talk.

1085
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,730
She's like, how fucking dare you take over my stream.

1086
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:37,190
Okay, let me figure out this first.

1087
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:38,550
Alright.

1088
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:46,290
A lot of these enemies aren't actually a threat because they're just like giant fodder for me to chainsaw.

1089
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:47,150
Oh, shit.

1090
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:51,410
Okay, that's a little cheap because he landed on me.

1091
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,490
Yeah, all typing, no yapping.

1092
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,990
She's like, excuse me, I'm the Yoshi here.

1093
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:03,620
Alright.

1094
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,060
Nice.

1095
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,000
I just think that wall riding one was like...

1096
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,600
The wall riding one was like...

1097
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,760
Like, this is so much easier than...

1098
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,180
I don't know.

1099
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,400
Am I bad?

1100
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,120
No, I'm not bad.

1101
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:14,800
I'm a streamer.

1102
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,640
I'm not bad.

1103
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,520
This is my channel.

1104
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:18,580
I don't know.

1105
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,300
I just think the wall riding one was definitely a lot harder than this level.

1106
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,260
I knew it.

1107
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,540
I knew there was a secret there.

1108
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,540
It was so predictable.

1109
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:40,860
Wait, what?

1110
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:42,580
Okay.

1111
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:44,540
Nice.

1112
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,340
Wait, is this another secret entrance to somewhere?

1113
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,200
Where does this go?

1114
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,140
Hello?

1115
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,460
Where does this go?

1116
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,940
Okay.

1117
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,060
Wait, what?

1118
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,540
I just keep...

1119
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,220
No, no, no, come on.

1120
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,260
Go up, go up, go up.

1121
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,200
Go up.

1122
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:11,560
Nice.

1123
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,040
Yippee!

1124
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,420
Okay, we got another secret.

1125
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,860
Wait, why would I need to close his eyes?

1126
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,740
Huh?

1127
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,360
Why would his eyes ever need to be closed?

1128
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,460
Okay, I don't understand.

1129
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,460
I don't understand why...

1130
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:31,800
Oh!

1131
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,240
Oh, okay.

1132
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,560
Wait.

1133
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,660
What?

1134
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,480
Huh?

1135
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,620
Huh?

1136
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,380
I have to close the eyes down there, but how?

1137
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,240
What?

1138
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:00,200
Okay, so I do have to close it, but how?

1139
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,300
I just use the dash?

1140
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:15,410
What?

1141
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,300
Wait, how do I...?

1142
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,200
Oh, does the chainsaw go through this?

1143
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,040
Oh, it does!

1144
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,100
Oh, okay.

1145
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,580
Okay, I now know.

1146
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,040
I'm learning, guys.

1147
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,500
I'm learning.

1148
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,340
Look, I'm sorry.

1149
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,920
My hand needs to be held.

1150
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,180
Or I'll never learn.

1151
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:45,400
It has to be directly in my face and be like, Doki, you gotta do this.

1152
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,760
And I'll be like, okay.

1153
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:46,880
Okay.

1154
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,920
They need to, like, put it in front of my face.

1155
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,240
And be like, this is how you play the game.

1156
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,700
And I'll be like, thank God.

1157
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,320
Where is my yellow?

1158
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,420
Exactly, where the fuck is my yellow paint?

1159
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,860
Alright, can I face tank this, too?

1160
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,020
I have, like, literally three power-ups.

1161
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,220
Like, three healers.

1162
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,840
Alright, let's see.

1163
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,820
Oh, wait.

1164
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,160
It's just a dolphin.

1165
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,140
Or I can just be here.

1166
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,140
I can just be in the middle.

1167
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,520
Oh, shit!

1168
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:24,980
I can't beat him!

1169
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,960
Guys, apparently, I cannot just be in the middle yet.

1170
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,820
What the fuck?!

1171
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,820
Wait, how do I...

1172
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:40,410
Okay, nice.

1173
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:41,810
Okay, guys.

1174
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:45,590
Apparently, this dolphin is not just gonna sit there and let me beat the shit out of him.

1175
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:46,750
Like...

1176
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:48,550
Understandable.

1177
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,030
Understandable.

1178
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,270
Like, who wouldn't want to just get, like, chainsawed to death?

1179
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,050
Okay, nice.

1180
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:02,790
I can't believe... I can't believe he wouldn't just, like, sit there and just let me do this to him.

1181
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,150
Alright, nice.

1182
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:06,690
Get over here.

1183
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,370
Wait, I can't even reach him.

1184
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:12,210
Okay.

1185
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:14,650
Okay.

1186
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:15,910
Alright, where is he going?

1187
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,370
Where is he going?

1188
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:16,730
Here.

1189
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,510
That's fucking right!

1190
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:19,610
Let me beat the shit out of you!

1191
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:21,850
That's right!

1192
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:23,570
That's right!

1193
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,450
You think I won't take this?!

1194
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:27,330
I'm too dumb to realize how to dodge!

1195
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,130
That's fucking right!

1196
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:34,150
I'm way too dumb!

1197
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,690
Okay, I can't do anything about it, though.

1198
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,300
Okay, 50.

1199
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,740
That's a fucking rough face to take this!

1200
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,220
Get over here!

1201
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,360
Get over here!

1202
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,800
Get over here!

1203
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,980
I'm gonna start swinging!

1204
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,360
Oh, I heard dolphin meat is pretty good!

1205
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,880
Get over here!

1206
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,340
I'm in a chain!

1207
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,720
That's right.

1208
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,660
To be fair, they're like a menace to society anyway.

1209
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,440
So, like, nothing is actually lost if we eat a dolphin.

1210
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,040
You think they're cute?!

1211
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,720
They're actual, like, they're like the...

1212
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,600
They're like criminals of the ocean world.

1213
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:31,900
They're like the mafia.

1214
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,000
The mafia of the ocean world.

1215
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,680
They literally will, like...

1216
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,760
They actually can, like, take other sea creatures hostage.

1217
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,260
Or, like...

1218
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,800
Or, like, commit crime.

1219
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,600
They murder for fun.

1220
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,800
Yeah, they're one of the few...

1221
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:56,440
They're also one of the few animals in the world that, like, bang for fun.

1222
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,160
Like, for pleasure.

1223
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,780
Like, a lot of...

1224
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,100
You know, like, a lot of the animals in the...

1225
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,160
A lot of the animals in the, like...

1226
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,560
In the...

1227
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,840
In the world are, like, reproduction, you know?

1228
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,340
But dolphins are, like, pleasure.

1229
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,700
There's no laws in the ocean, exactly.

1230
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,240
They're like, wait a minute.

1231
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,420
This is fun.

1232
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,600
But, like, they're one of the few...

1233
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:32,840
They're one of the few animals that actually realize that, like, it's more than just, like, babies.

1234
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,440
There's...

1235
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,080
There's no laws in the ocean, exactly.

1236
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,440
Get over here.

1237
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,820
Come on, one more swing.

1238
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,080
I know you just need one more.

1239
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,540
Okay, maybe two more swings.

1240
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,240
Maybe three more swings.

1241
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,800
Get over here.

1242
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,100
What if I...

1243
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,000
No, I can't.

1244
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,160
Alright, I'll just wait.

1245
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,860
Oh my god, please.

1246
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,840
He's literally one.

1247
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,320
There we go.

1248
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,000
Wait, what?

1249
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,660
Okay, now he's literally one?

1250
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,040
What?

1251
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,280
Okay, now he's literally one.

1252
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,120
There's no way he's not one now.

1253
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,700
There's no way.

1254
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:26,820
Yay!

1255
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,340
Alright, nice.

1256
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,560
Okay, we're at stage four.

1257
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,520
Get up for stage four!

1258
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:45,430
What is this?

1259
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,010
He's literally one, guys.

1260
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:54,150
It's like when I play, like, competitive shooters and I'm like, he's literally one, guys.

1261
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:55,610
And he was actually half HP.

1262
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:57,530
But, like...

1263
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:02,070
You say that so people would, like, shoot him so he could be one later.

1264
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:07,090
And then I'll just do that, right?

1265
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,090
Yeah.

1266
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:11,910
Goddammit, wait, what?

1267
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:14,470
Do I...

1268
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,390
Do I do this?

1269
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:17,630
And then...

1270
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:21,110
Do I do?

1271
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:22,830
Wait, what?

1272
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:24,430
How do I hit that?

1273
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,330
Yeah, he's one if you shoot at him enough, exactly.

1274
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,290
I'm talking about one in the future.

1275
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,420
How do I...

1276
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:38,690
I'm, like, trying to figure out.

1277
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,390
Yeah, because I can't do that in time.

1278
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:45,850
How?

1279
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,770
Yeah, because I can't make that.

1280
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,210
I can't make that in time.

1281
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:54,010
Hello?

1282
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:56,390
Hello?

1283
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:01,160
What?

1284
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,300
Oh, okay.

1285
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:05,680
Do I just charge it?

1286
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,500
Oh my God, I...

1287
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,120
This is exposing me.

1288
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,420
This game is exposing me and I don't like it.

1289
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:34,600
You guys are like, oh no, thank God we didn't vote for her for Gamer of the Year.

1290
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,060
Doki, that's exactly why you didn't get nominated.

1291
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,940
You can't be Gamer of the Year if you're only good at one genre.

1292
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,960
I'm, like, ow!

1293
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,500
I'm so confused!

1294
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,820
I'm actually so confused.

1295
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,380
Why can't I do anything?

1296
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,660
Okay, I figured this out.

1297
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,460
I figured this out.

1298
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,340
I can't do this.

1299
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,840
I don't know.

1300
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,120
Guys, please.

1301
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,320
I'm so confused.

1302
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,160
Where's the yellow pin?

1303
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,780
Guys, I don't understand.

1304
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,100
Oh my God.

1305
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,500
Okay, double jump after the charge.

1306
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,640
Oh my God, I'm so smart, guys.

1307
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:51,360
I always knew.

1308
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,000
I knew what I was doing.

1309
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,700
Okay.

1310
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,940
So easy.

1311
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,420
Oh shit, okay.

1312
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,100
Let's do this.

1313
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,720
Okay.

1314
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:11,540
Alright.

1315
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,300
Oh, don't.

1316
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,060
Okay, I figured it out.

1317
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,560
I figured it out, guys.

1318
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,760
Oh my God, natural.

1319
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,640
I'm a natural.

1320
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,020
Where does this go?

1321
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,020
What is this?

1322
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,780
That's my OG, everybody.

1323
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,680
Milanta, thank you for the super chat.

1324
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:43,820
Thank you, thank you.

1325
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,140
Guys, it wasn't brute force.

1326
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,020
I naturally knew what to do.

1327
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,830
Oh my God, please.

1328
01:06:58,730 --> 01:06:59,530
Please.

1329
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,860
Oh, please, please, please.

1330
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,320
Please, I don't understand.

1331
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:10,560
Please.

1332
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,260
Please!

1333
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:13,880
Please!

1334
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,640
Why did they bring me back?

1335
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,520
Why did they bring me back?

1336
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,600
Okay, I understand.

1337
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,640
I understand now.

1338
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:30,960
Look at that.

1339
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:31,980
The first try.

1340
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,300
It's so smooth.

1341
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,740
So smart.

1342
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,900
Wait, there's something over here.

1343
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,880
What's over here?

1344
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,280
It won't let me go down.

1345
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,670
What the fuck was over there?

1346
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,860
Yeah, I knew there was something over here.

1347
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,420
Oh, okay, never mind.

1348
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:59,220
It was just welcome back to hell.

1349
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,480
Alright, so if you fuck up, you have to do this all over again.

1350
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:04,680
But that's the best part.

1351
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,700
I would not fuck up.

1352
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,300
That's the best part.

1353
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,100
I would not fuck up, guys.

1354
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,380
Oh my God, please.

1355
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,740
Get me out of here.

1356
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:21,280
Get me out of the wall right now.

1357
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,040
Please, I don't...

1358
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:24,500
Please.

1359
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,660
Please.

1360
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,520
Get me out.

1361
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,140
Get me out.

1362
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,360
This is the worst mechanic.

1363
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:37,900
This is the worst mechanic they have.

1364
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:41,840
Okay.

1365
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:43,160
Okay.

1366
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,900
Okay.

1367
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:47,640
Okay.

1368
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,020
Oh my God, Buzz!

1369
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,480
Buzz, let me back out!

1370
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,160
Alright, we can do this.

1371
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,000
We can do this.

1372
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,200
Right here, right now.

1373
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,220
Okay, not now.

1374
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,820
Not now, but right here.

1375
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,560
Okay, right here.

1376
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,220
I think now.

1377
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,140
Oh my God, yes.

1378
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,220
Oh my God, yes.

1379
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:21,940
Oh my God, yes.

1380
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:26,970
Okay.

1381
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:28,450
There you go.

1382
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,270
I told you, right here, right now.

1383
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,390
I told you, right here, don't.

1384
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,930
Please, don't do this to me.

1385
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:37,330
Please, don't do this to me.

1386
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:38,670
Okay.

1387
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,190
Put him, put him back on.

1388
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,810
Thank you for the super chat.

1389
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,000
Okay, there we go.

1390
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,760
Oh, thank God, I figured it out.

1391
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:52,820
Alright, nice.

1392
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,080
We got another Tetris piece.

1393
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,420
How far do I- How many do I have to do?

1394
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,240
Do I, like, put them in now?

1395
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,220
No, I have to get all the Tetris pieces.

1396
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:04,260
Alright.

1397
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,920
That can't be that bad, right?

1398
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:08,940
Alright.

1399
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,440
Okay, now that I got the hard ones off...

1400
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,920
Things would be easier now.

1401
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,180
I got the harder levels away now, guys.

1402
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,660
This part is super easy.

1403
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,060
Okay, just...

1404
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:24,920
Give me a sec.

1405
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,920
I'll get there eventually, guys.

1406
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:31,560
Just- It's like three to four business days, but I'll get there.

1407
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:34,500
Okay, apparently not.

1408
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,520
Alright, I touched it.

1409
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:37,880
Nice.

1410
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,700
I told you, three to four business days.

1411
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,700
Wait, what?

1412
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:49,520
Okay.

1413
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:49,700
Okay.

1414
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:52,920
Okay.

1415
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:53,800
Wait.

1416
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,040
Wait, wait.

1417
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,220
Wait, wait a minute.

1418
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:56,800
Wait a minute.

1419
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,540
Wait a minute.

1420
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,520
Right here, and then...

1421
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:03,960
What?

1422
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:08,580
Okay, nice.

1423
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:10,920
I figured it out.

1424
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,480
And then...

1425
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,180
Wait, what?

1426
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,080
Oh, okay, I do- I jump...

1427
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:20,280
And then I use my powers here, and then...

1428
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,780
Okay, alright, that's not it.

1429
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,160
But like, I jump...

1430
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,280
And then...

1431
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,360
And- Oh my god, please.

1432
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,400
Okay, I jump...

1433
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,400
I- I- I jump...

1434
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:34,780
And then...

1435
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,280
Okay...

1436
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,380
And then from here...

1437
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,580
Oh my god, please.

1438
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,360
Alright, I jump...

1439
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,780
And then from here...

1440
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,280
And then...

1441
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,920
Oh my god, I am a fucking gamer.

1442
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,280
That's fucking right.

1443
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,000
That's me.

1444
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,160
The hard part's done.

1445
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,580
Nice, alright.

1446
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,420
See, look at that.

1447
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,860
That was so much easier than the fucking wall ride.

1448
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,160
I just don't know.

1449
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,720
My mind just...

1450
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,080
My mind just can't, like...

1451
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,360
Comprehend, like...

1452
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,160
Wall jumping.

1453
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:11,960
It just feels so unnatural.

1454
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,920
My brain is like...

1455
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,040
This is- This goes against all laws of aviation.

1456
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,810
The fuck are these babies doing here?

1457
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:28,230
Like...

1458
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:29,030
They're so weak.

1459
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:33,550
I should- I should use this one so I can get my full HP now.

1460
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,450
We're so slow though.

1461
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,690
I don't like how slow we are.

1462
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:44,330
Is it supposed to be slow?

1463
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:46,370
I can't tell.

1464
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:50,450
I can't tell if I'm supposed to be slow as fuck.

1465
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:54,150
Alright.

1466
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:55,650
Next level.

1467
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:57,210
Wait, that was it?

1468
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,010
They were like...

1469
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:00,950
Unarmed and everything.

1470
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,660
Yeah, I know.

1471
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,040
I was like, they were unarmed.

1472
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,320
They were just babies.

1473
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:14,330
Alright.

1474
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,430
Let's get this power up.

1475
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,310
Yeah!

1476
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:19,870
I got the secret.

1477
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,090
Yippee!

1478
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,780
I feel like I'm gonna die.

1479
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,140
I feel like I'm getting slower and slower.

1480
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,200
But I don't know if it's my game.

1481
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:31,600
Oh, hey.

1482
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,120
Hello.

1483
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:33,900
Are you the boss right now?

1484
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,240
I'm gonna kill you.

1485
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:40,680
Oh, shit.

1486
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:41,880
I'm gonna take it.

1487
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,640
That's how I'm gonna kill you.

1488
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,380
You think I learned how- Oh, fuck!

1489
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,300
You think I learned how to dodge this entire time?

1490
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,640
Let's go!

1491
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,140
Oh, shit.

1492
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,580
Oh, wait.

1493
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,140
Okay, this is awkward now.

1494
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:03,880
It's alright.

1495
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:05,280
I still killed you.

1496
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,820
Who needs to do mechanics?

1497
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:14,820
There you go.

1498
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:15,840
Stage 5.

1499
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,880
I didn't pay exactly.

1500
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,160
I didn't pay $9 to fucking dodge.

1501
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:27,870
I should have everything.

1502
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:28,410
Oh, my god.

1503
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:29,470
I'm Kaenjo now.

1504
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:32,810
Hello.

1505
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:34,010
Wait, what?

1506
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,570
Hold to charge it up.

1507
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,670
Okay, I don't wanna waste my charge up though.

1508
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,730
Wait, unless I do?

1509
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:45,310
Oh, shit.

1510
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:46,610
Yeah, I'm not wasting that.

1511
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:49,450
Wait, are we like Touhou now?

1512
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:50,430
Is this Touhou?

1513
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:53,810
Mental illness?

1514
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:54,450
Why?

1515
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:56,730
Oh, no.

1516
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:58,050
Oh, it is Touhou.

1517
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:02,030
Oh, it is.

1518
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:07,730
Okay, I need to like charge it up to...

1519
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,470
Oh, I should not leave people die.

1520
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,370
What is this game?

1521
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,770
Now I'm in Touhou?

1522
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,570
I'm just gonna hold this for now.

1523
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:24,790
Oh, shit.

1524
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,090
That's so much damage.

1525
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,370
Oh, it's side scroll.

1526
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:30,850
Okay.

1527
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:33,490
Alright.

1528
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:34,610
Oh, bullet hell.

1529
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:35,110
Exactly.

1530
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:36,490
I see bullet hell.

1531
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:37,210
Is this Touhou?

1532
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:43,490
Alright.

1533
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:44,790
Goodbye.

1534
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:48,050
I'm just gonna be full HP just in case.

1535
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,910
Goodbye.

1536
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:52,930
Nice.

1537
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,610
Okay, goodbye.

1538
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,920
I'm gonna AD strafe just in case.

1539
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,900
Don't worry, this AD strafe will be helpful later on.

1540
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:05,760
You just don't understand.

1541
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:11,280
Okay, I took damage because I was AD strafing, but you don't understand.

1542
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:11,980
It will be useful.

1543
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,380
Oh, god.

1544
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,480
Oh, god.

1545
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,960
Oh, that's way too many things.

1546
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,620
And then...

1547
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,220
I need to...

1548
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,560
Make sure I get past this in time.

1549
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,040
Yay, I lived!

1550
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,500
Oh, shit.

1551
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:32,220
Oh, shit.

1552
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:32,460
Okay.

1553
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:34,420
It's fine.

1554
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,180
I still lived.

1555
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,700
Trust the process.

1556
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,840
I'm dodging bullets like this.

1557
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,880
Trust the process, guys.

1558
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,460
I'm practicing for Marvel Rivals tomorrow.

1559
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,760
Trust the process.

1560
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,200
Oh, my god.

1561
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,660
There's so many things on my screen.

1562
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,040
Okay.

1563
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,260
Okay, nice.

1564
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,260
Okay, that's me, but evil.

1565
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,620
I'm just gonna...

1566
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,440
I didn't learn.

1567
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,680
I didn't learn.

1568
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,480
What do you think I learned?

1569
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,400
I didn't learn.

1570
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,020
Oh, shit.

1571
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:05,860
Maybe I should learn.

1572
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:06,600
You're doing...

1573
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,960
You're doing a lot of damage.

1574
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,220
Whoa!

1575
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:11,180
Whoa!

1576
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:11,900
Whoa!

1577
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:12,580
Whoa!

1578
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,780
What is this?

1579
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:14,540
Whoa!

1580
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:15,800
Okay.

1581
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:19,680
It's fine.

1582
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,580
That's not fine.

1583
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:22,060
Whoa.

1584
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:22,500
Okay.

1585
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:23,280
Give me a sec.

1586
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,600
Okay, now that I know...

1587
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:28,570
Oh, my god.

1588
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,390
Like, I barely...

1589
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,910
Do I need to charge this up?

1590
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,210
Okay, maybe.

1591
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:37,410
Oh, okay.

1592
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:38,170
I have to do that.

1593
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:38,490
Okay.

1594
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:39,410
I realize now.

1595
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,030
Oh, okay.

1596
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:42,610
Now it's Touhou.

1597
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:43,630
Now it's Touhou.

1598
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:45,110
Now it's Touhou, guys.

1599
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:46,730
Now it's Touhou.

1600
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:47,970
Now...

1601
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,450
This is definitely Touhou now.

1602
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:50,210
This is...

1603
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,410
Oh, this is definitely Touhou.

1604
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:56,630
Oh, shit.

1605
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,650
Oh, shit.

1606
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:58,030
Okay.

1607
01:17:58,330 --> 01:17:58,970
Okay.

1608
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:02,010
Okay, I think I'm actually in Touhou.

1609
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,450
Oh, fuck.

1610
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:07,870
Okay.

1611
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:09,110
Okay.

1612
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:12,050
Okay.

1613
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:13,530
Okay, buddy.

1614
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:15,590
Okay.

1615
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:17,650
Okay.

1616
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:18,610
Okay, buddy.

1617
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:19,290
Okay.

1618
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:20,070
Okay.

1619
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:21,370
Alright, calm down.

1620
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:22,410
Calm down.

1621
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,590
Oh, I did not...

1622
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:26,050
I'm not...

1623
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:26,630
I'm not ready for Touhou.

1624
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,330
I'm just gonna say it.

1625
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,310
I am 100% never ready when it's Touhou.

1626
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,890
I do not know what to do when it's Touhou.

1627
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,970
I'm not a Touhouer.

1628
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,370
I didn't grow up with Touhou.

1629
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:37,990
I'm sorry.

1630
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:39,010
I'm fake.

1631
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:42,710
Okay.

1632
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:44,850
Alright.

1633
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:49,430
Wait, what is he doing?

1634
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:50,670
Wait, what?

1635
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:51,810
Wait, what?

1636
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:54,930
Okay.

1637
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:56,790
Alright.

1638
01:18:57,710 --> 01:18:58,550
Okay.

1639
01:18:58,930 --> 01:18:59,750
Is he dying?

1640
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:00,150
Oh, wait.

1641
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:01,850
He's like dying while doing that.

1642
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:03,450
Oh, nice.

1643
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:05,530
Nice.

1644
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:09,010
Woah.

1645
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:11,970
Woah.

1646
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:13,010
Okay.

1647
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:13,670
Nice.

1648
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,610
Alright, goodbye.

1649
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:25,610
Toki is sad now.

1650
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,430
Yay, I did it!

1651
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:34,430
Did I win?

1652
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:40,230
How the fuck did you know to spam tap?

1653
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:41,290
It says J.

1654
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:46,570
If I see a key button, I tap.

1655
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:48,710
Is that it?

1656
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:50,790
Wait, this was so easy.

1657
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:53,570
People in the reviews were like...

1658
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:55,990
The last level was so hard.

1659
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:56,610
I can never...

1660
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:58,370
It's so hard to beat the last level.

1661
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,930
Bro, I'm not even the Touhou-er.

1662
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:06,790
I don't even Touhou.

1663
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:08,450
Wait, that's it?

1664
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:10,350
What?

1665
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:11,970
Okay.

1666
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:15,730
You know, I expected the last level to be a lot harder.

1667
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:19,710
Okay, wait, wait.

1668
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:24,670
I need you guys to see the reviews for this.

1669
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:27,970
People were like, Oh man, that last level was so difficult.

1670
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:29,430
I'm like, what?

1671
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:36,790
What?

1672
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:39,970
Let's see.

1673
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:41,030
People were like...

1674
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:43,030
The person who thought was probably saying, What do you mean?

1675
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,690
Seven years for such a short gameplay?

1676
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,650
I mean, it looks cool, but...

1677
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:51,310
For three levels!

1678
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,510
It's not just three levels.

1679
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:58,630
It was actually six levels.

1680
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:00,130
And...

1681
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:03,610
My fingers hurt.

1682
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:06,290
We're not real gamers.

1683
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:08,570
Yeah, that was the last level.

1684
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,350
To be fair, at least it wasn't...

1685
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:14,430
To be fair, at least it wasn't like...

1686
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,870
Just the...

1687
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:19,390
Just the typing game.

1688
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:22,150
Because then, the typing game was literally ten minutes of content.

1689
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:24,410
At least we got an hour out of this.

1690
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:29,430
At least...

1691
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,670
At least we...

1692
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:35,050
I'm glad we got an hour out of this game, at least.

1693
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:35,770
You know?

1694
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:38,790
An hour worth of gameplay.

1695
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,930
And, anyway, tonight...

1696
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:43,110
We still have a second stream tonight, anyway.

1697
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:47,030
So, at least...

1698
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:48,950
At least we have a second stream.

1699
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:54,390
Yeah, I was...

1700
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,490
Very surprised how easy it was.

1701
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:59,470
I heard some people were saying the last level was gonna be really hard.

1702
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:01,650
And I was like, that's it?

1703
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:07,430
I was like, bro, I don't even Touhou.

1704
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,410
I'm not even a Touhou-er.

1705
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:12,710
That was so easy!

1706
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:17,630
What's sound test?

1707
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,390
Oh, I think it was just...

1708
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:24,310
It was just to test the music out to see if you liked the volume.

1709
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25,470
I'm pretty sure.

1710
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:26,850
Alright, nice.

1711
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:27,530
We did it.

1712
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:29,410
We beat Touhou.

1713
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:30,330
We did it, guys.

1714
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:36,690
Oh my god.

1715
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,330
I can't believe that.

1716
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,110
That was a short stream, guys.

1717
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:41,170
I had a great time.

1718
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:44,690
At least I have time to buy dog food.

1719
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:46,250
At least now.

1720
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:50,110
At least now I have time to buy dog food before Toraba.

1721
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:53,590
But yeah, this is like a little appetizer, I guess.

1722
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:57,370
We got a little appetizer before tonight.

1723
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:02,150
We do have a second stream tonight with Toraba, the creating game.

1724
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:04,330
So I'll see you guys tonight for that.

1725
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:12,230
And tomorrow, we do have a stream tomorrow on Sunday with Doobie.

1726
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:16,730
So we're going to be playing Marble Rivals tomorrow on Sunday with Doobie at 5pm PST.

1727
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:20,070
So get ready to be there.

1728
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:22,090
Oh, she's...

1729
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:24,670
Spark, the story for pre...

1730
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:26,230
Sorry, my brain is so frazzled today.

1731
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:29,270
Like, you can tell I'm stumbling words and I don't know what to say today.

1732
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:31,350
Because, like, legitimately, like...

1733
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,310
I went through so many...

1734
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,690
Like, when I go through a lot of emotions in a short...

1735
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:38,230
In a short amount of time...

1736
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:41,210
Like, I just don't know what to say.

1737
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:43,450
Like, my mind takes slower...

1738
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:45,150
It takes slower to process things.

1739
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:47,410
Or, like, longer to process...

1740
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,910
It takes longer for me to process things.

1741
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:52,610
And my mind is, like, stumbling and buffering a lot.

1742
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:54,770
Because I legitimately thought my dog was dying.

1743
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:57,170
But it's because I gave him stale food and he's like...

1744
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:59,150
She's like, the fuck is this, bitch?

1745
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:00,170
Like...

1746
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:02,610
He's like, excuse me.

1747
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:06,310
I am a purebred pedigree wiener dog.

1748
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:09,170
And you expect me to eat stale food?

1749
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,170
And then, like, you know, I...

1750
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:16,850
So, like...

1751
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:19,750
So, like, I was freaking out about that for a while.

1752
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:23,850
Hey, guys.

1753
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:26,330
I'm gonna go buy dog food now.

1754
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:28,830
So my dog doesn't starve.

1755
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:31,850
I'll see you guys next...

1756
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:32,950
I'll see you guys tonight, everybody.

1757
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:34,170
As always, everyone.

1758
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:35,110
Stay hydrated.

1759
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:36,090
Posture check.

1760
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:37,150
Get up and move around.

1761
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:38,030
Get that blood flowing.

1762
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:38,750
And stay up for me?

1763
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:41,290
Stay up a little longer, because I do have another stream at 5 PM.

1764
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:42,990
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1765
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,350
Bye, guys.

1766
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:45,350
Bye!

1767
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:52,090
Also, I realized I could've finished the platformer section, like, legitimately 30 minutes earlier.

1768
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:56,370
If, like, my brain understood the game breaking physics during wall...

1769
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:57,730
If I understood wall jumping.

1770
01:24:57,990 --> 01:24:58,890
I just... I can't.

1771
01:24:58,910 --> 01:24:59,670
I don't know why.

1772
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:01,030
My brain is like...

1773
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:02,670
This should not work...

1774
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:04,170
Like, this should not work in real life.

1775
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:10,150
I see wall jumping and my brain cannot compute.

1776
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:11,030
And it's like...

1777
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:12,650
This breaks all laws of physics.

1778
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:13,470
How dare you?

1779
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:14,610
Fucking witchcraft.

1780
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:17,230
Hey, guys.

1781
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:18,310
See you, everybody.

1782
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:19,530
Bye, guys.

1783
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:20,110
Bye!
