1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
If you don't win, it's okay.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,300
It's all right.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,340
Don't worry about that.

4
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,020
You know, unless it's Sunday, then it's not okay.

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,040
And we're having fun.

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,360
We're having fun.

7
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,260
Guys, we're having fun.

8
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,040
Good luck.

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,540
Have fun.

10
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,900
We can all fall back on our regular 9-5s.

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,840
Don't worry about it.

12
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,460
This is my 9-5, though.

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,760
No need to stress.

14
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,580
Oh, no.

15
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,300
Let's go, Dougie.

16
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,620
Let's go.

17
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,160
Yes!

18
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,940
Okay, okay.

19
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,180
Get going.

20
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,520
He's burnt.

21
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,640
Wait, how come that grab didn't go through?

22
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,100
Don't worry about it.

23
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,880
Get in there.

24
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,580
Nice.

25
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,360
There you go.

26
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,700
Yes!

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,240
You can just hit her again.

28
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,040
Okay.

29
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,560
Nice!

30
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,120
Get her ass!

31
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,140
Come on!

32
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,880
Oh, no.

33
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,500
It's all right.

34
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,640
No worries.

35
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,820
No biggie.

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,740
Health is a resource.

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,580
All right?

38
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,280
That's just the tax.

39
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, my gosh.

40
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,720
Oh, my gosh.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,860
Yeehaw, baby.

42
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,580
Okay.

43
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,260
She doesn't know.

44
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,380
She can't see.

45
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,480
No!

46
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,360
I like it.

47
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,140
I like it.

48
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,180
You're absolutely insane, dude.

49
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
Dougie, I'm nice key, dude.

50
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,320
Dougie, I'm nice bird.

51
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,400
I don't think the delay is that much.

52
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:34,840
My turn.

53
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,400
I literally just saw it in real time.

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,980
Are you one and done, her?

55
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,120
That's my turn.

56
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,940
Listen, you're concerned about player two.

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
That was the freest match I've seen for you on player two ever.

58
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,920
True.

59
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,600
I think you got it.

60
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,600
I don't think you gotta worry about this.

61
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,140
Don't sell yourself short, Dougie.

62
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,220
You messed up my spectator.

63
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,660
There's no left or right when you press triangle, so you got this.

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,340
I'm back in there.

65
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm back in there.

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,740
I'm in.

67
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,580
Nice!

68
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,420
Oh, my God.

69
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,660
I felt that.

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,140
I'm excited here.

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,900
I gotta calm down.

72
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,720
Come on!

73
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,040
Nice punish!

74
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,300
I just covered that.

75
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:32,740
Let's go.

76
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:33,820
What?

77
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,380
I'm getting too excited here.

78
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,640
The lab work is paying off.

79
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,680
Oh, man.

80
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,860
It's about to be the freest match.

81
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,200
I won't hold back.

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,820
I'd be scared to go in.

83
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,540
I'd be scared, too.

84
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,040
Nice.

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,820
Good job.

86
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,320
Yeah!

87
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,600
Good jump over.

88
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,700
You're mine!

89
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,900
You're mine!

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,560
I am almighty!

91
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,380
Next DI, you get level 3.

92
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,160
Okay.

93
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,330
That was a good attempt.

94
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,590
That was really smart.

95
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:18,990
That's one!

96
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,330
It's over!

97
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,510
Let's go!

98
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,010
The freest match I've seen!

99
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,170
Oh, my goodness.

100
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,010
That was dopey!

101
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,130
Dude, training matters!

102
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,570
The training paid off!

103
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,110
That was night and day from last time.

104
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,210
You played so...

105
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,050
You knew the matchup.

106
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,590
Good job!

107
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,670
That was so sick, dude.

108
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,990
Training does work.

109
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,870
I call that revenge.

110
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,870
For Ultima, the only thing about Ultima SK is that this guy DI's randomly all the time.

111
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,870
But he also knows how to counter DI.

112
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,150
So, just chill on your DI and punish his.

113
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,030
You know how to punish that now.

114
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,350
And do everything you know how to do.

115
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,610
You got the training.

116
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,870
I have been waking up at night to counter DI's.

117
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,310
So, he will throw DI randomly and you will cook him for it.

118
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,950
I've been downloading those one-hour videos with random DI's splattered here and there.

119
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,430
No, I didn't even download it.

120
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,150
I made it.

121
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:20,910
It's so much worse.

122
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,350
She created it.

123
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,110
You made it yourself.

124
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,670
She's the mad scientist herself.

125
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,650
That's crazy.

126
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,810
Alright, here we go.

127
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,690
Woah!

128
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,530
It's the blaze over.

129
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,260
Nice break.

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,840
Nice!

131
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,060
Now you can use DI yourself.

132
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,780
Let's go!

133
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,220
That's alright.

134
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,640
You can learn from the next one.

135
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,420
When you do it against him, right?

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,880
No, he countered DI's.

137
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,620
That's the only thing.

138
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,420
Don't use DI against him when he has meter.

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Jesus Christ, he does so much damage.

140
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,520
That's Luke, baby.

141
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,520
Nice, that's fine.

142
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,240
Take the throw.

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,820
Very good.

144
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,620
That's close.

145
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,180
You're seeing it.

146
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,080
Just let him wake up.

147
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,020
He's in neutral.

148
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,800
Your drive rushes are great.

149
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,940
Just let him wake up.

150
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,740
Good defense.

151
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,820
You're sick with it!

152
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,780
You're sick with it!

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,640
That's insane!

154
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,800
Yeah, rush him down.

155
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,660
He has no meter, so you can eat a DP.

156
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,160
It's fine.

157
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,340
Let's go!

158
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,000
He's burnt out.

159
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,620
Do it again.

160
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,380
Have you punched a DI?

161
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,520
It's fine.

162
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,220
It's over.

163
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,700
Just chill.

164
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,660
No way!

165
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,700
Just chill.

166
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,800
It's alright.

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,680
Composure.

168
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,120
No worries.

169
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,400
Sorry, he stuffs so much HP.

170
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,760
Let's get out of the corner.

171
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,280
Nice.

172
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,080
Nice!

173
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,240
It's fine.

174
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
You're playing better than him.

175
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,480
Very close.

176
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,560
You're playing better than him.

177
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,240
You know the game plan.

178
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,400
He's just YOLOing a lot.

179
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,240
And it's like, wow, he's really doing that.

180
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,500
You know what I mean.

181
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,550
Nice.

182
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:53,820
Combo!

183
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,640
Get her!

184
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,500
You could've still grabbed him there.

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,900
Have you punched a DI when you get him in the corner?

186
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,100
Yep.

187
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,980
Rush him down.

188
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,800
Combo!

189
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,880
Eske, you're so sick.

190
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,320
Let's go.

191
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:10,820
It's okay.

192
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,920
No worries.

193
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,660
Just do it again.

194
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,240
You're gonna chip him out.

195
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,980
Yeah, you can just jab.

196
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,040
Exactly.

197
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,340
Let's go.

198
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,640
Eske.

199
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,350
Fine.

200
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,190
Nice defense.

201
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,430
That eating a throw is totally cool.

202
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:36,770
You're good.

203
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,250
Get him.

204
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,950
Okay, just chill on the meter.

205
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,030
That's fine.

206
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,950
Just chill.

207
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,130
Nice.

208
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,770
Nice defense.

209
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,230
Yeah, just chill on the meter.

210
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:54,890
Nice.

211
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,750
Now you can use meter.

212
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:57,910
You're good.

213
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,010
You have your super.

214
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,150
Okay, that's alright.

215
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,190
Yeah, just let him wake up.

216
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,500
Oh, nice.

217
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,200
Oh, no meter.

218
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,240
Yeah, just chill on the DI.

219
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,000
He's just gonna jump.

220
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,060
He's just jumping whenever he's in burnout.

221
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:30,860
Nice.

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,780
Oh, I love it.

223
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,680
Oh, nice combo.

224
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,380
See, he's just gonna jump.

225
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,900
There we go.

226
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,580
Oh, you're sick with it.

227
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,440
Oh, nice again.

228
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,380
Oh, let's go.

229
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,020
Eske!

230
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,920
You have the game plan.

231
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,580
You adapted so good.

232
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,140
Yeah.

233
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,900
Yeah, the only thing.

234
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,900
You figured it out.

235
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,880
When he's burned out, don't do DI right away.

236
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,640
He's gonna leapfrog.

237
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,820
Wait to get a clean heavy punch into DI.

238
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,620
And you got this.

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,400
Nice.

240
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,800
This is perfect for you.

241
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,280
Perfect for you.

242
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,260
Nice.

243
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,540
Nice DI.

244
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,600
Nice DI.

245
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,180
Heavy punch into DI.

246
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,420
Oh, that's good too.

247
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,880
Yep, guaranteed.

248
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,400
Oh, you're so sick, Eske.

249
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:23,800
Let's go.

250
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,500
That's okay.

251
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,640
Just keep it cool.

252
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,500
Keep it cool.

253
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:28,860
No worries.

254
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,160
He's in the corner.

255
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,500
He's gonna jump.

256
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,600
Nice grab.

257
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,720
Just chill.

258
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,220
Just chill.

259
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,220
Yeah, you're good.

260
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:50,530
Nice.

261
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,710
Let's fucking go.

262
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,130
That's my goat.

263
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,010
Oh my god, kill her.

264
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,090
No.

265
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,280
Nice DI kick.

266
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,040
That's cool.

267
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,040
Don't worry about it.

268
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:16,930
Yeah.

269
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,110
If you get in, just dry rush medium.

270
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:19,990
Okay.

271
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,570
Nice.

272
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,090
That's fine.

273
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,030
Just block it out.

274
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,790
He's gonna try to...

275
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,890
Let him wake up DP.

276
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:32,910
That's fine.

277
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,730
Guys, call out Eske.

278
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,450
Let's go.

279
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,190
Let's go.

280
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,830
Holy shit.

281
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,750
Eske, in two days, you have become a Street Fighter fucking player.

282
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:47,970
Oh my god.

283
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,750
Nah, she's goaded with the sauce, dude.

284
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,730
She's so sick.

285
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,530
I'm gonna kick the street gun out.

286
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,550
You have learned so much.

287
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,450
I left the room again.

288
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,790
I don't know what to do.

289
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,750
It's okay.

290
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,830
Listen, you win, you can do whatever you want.

291
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,510
Let's go, Eske.

292
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,050
That was amazing.

293
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,810
Oh my god.

294
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,310
I know her.

295
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,230
I know her.

296
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,190
Alright, Bravo.

297
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,530
You better 3-0 this.

298
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,090
No pressure.

299
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,090
No pressure.

300
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,590
Hold on a minute.

301
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,190
We gotta play.

302
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,570
What is the point of pressuring me?

303
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,790
You're already used to it.

304
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,090
You didn't take it.

305
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,970
No shot, dude.

306
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,190
We're freaking on a streak and Doki decides to jinx it.

307
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:26,710
Oh god.

308
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,090
No pressure.

309
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,190
No pressure, though.

310
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,650
No pressure.

311
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,210
She won her match.

312
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,350
Now it's time to...

313
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,410
Oh, gloves are off.

314
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,070
Everyone.

315
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,910
Esfan just...

316
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,410
He neutral jumps at a distance a lot.

317
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,670
He plays very patient, too.

318
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,870
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,590
Just don't go...

320
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,510
Don't whiff too many knees on him.

321
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,770
He likes to go to the air a lot.

322
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,350
That's about it.

323
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:51,810
You got this.

324
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,390
Let's go, Weepy.

325
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,850
Whoa, whoa.

326
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,450
Dragon Ball Z.

327
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,210
Every time, man.

328
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,650
Nice!

329
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,550
Yeehaw!

330
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,510
Let's go.

331
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,950
Too good, dude.

332
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,290
Too good.

333
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,170
Oh.

334
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,010
He's scared.

335
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,470
You tried to do your signature move.

336
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,190
Just chill with the knee on him.

337
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,650
He's just gonna jump back and do weird shit.

338
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,670
Yeah, just punish.

339
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,030
That's extremely punishable.

340
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,490
Sorry, that was too much pressure.

341
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,230
Okay.

342
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,950
We're now...

343
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,890
It ain't over yet.

344
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,890
Just chill.

345
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,310
Just chill.

346
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,070
He's gonna do something unsafe.

347
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:47,890
Just walk him down.

348
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,710
Oh, suck!

349
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,070
The fucking suck!

350
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:55,770
Oh!

351
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,450
Oh, sick!

352
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,670
Who is this guy?

353
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,250
Yep, sweet.

354
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,130
You can sweep that in return.

355
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,750
Nice.

356
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:04,930
It's alright.

357
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,030
Huge.

358
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,670
Punish that with SPD.

359
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,330
Oh, it's okay.

360
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,530
It's okay.

361
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:13,870
We're good.

362
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,050
We're good.

363
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,430
Oh, this is close.

364
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,730
Oh.

365
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,650
No way!

366
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,090
Does that work?

367
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,370
Oh, you're so sick!

368
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,650
Oh, the reaction!

369
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,590
That was amazing!

370
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,970
Oh my god, the reaction!

371
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,530
Holy shit!

372
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,690
Yeah, so just let him wake up.

373
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,910
And he's gonna do neutral jump in your grill every time.

374
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,510
It's time to lariat his ass, man.

375
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,370
If he gets a knockdown.

376
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,070
Yeah, don't even fucking bother teching a throw against him.

377
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,230
Oh, you know he's tilted.

378
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,190
He's tilted.

379
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:40,630
Get him.

380
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,430
Get his ass.

381
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,060
Oh.

382
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,280
Oh, yeah.

383
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,240
Oh, nice.

384
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,700
Oh, yeah.

385
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,100
Oh my goodness.

386
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,440
One day I'll be able to do that.

387
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:56,580
Yeah, just let him do something weird.

388
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Yeah, he wakes up dumb.

389
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:57,940
Oh, nice!

390
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,320
Oh, man!

391
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,320
This is clean.

392
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,120
You know you ain't gonna get command grab.

393
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,700
I love it.

394
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,340
I love it.

395
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,860
Holy shit!

396
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,240
He's scared, dude.

397
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,200
He's gonna be dreaming tonight, dude.

398
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,220
He's so locked in.

399
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,620
He's back in New York City.

400
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,380
Yes, sir.

401
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,860
Don't play it on me, player.

402
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,820
Yes, sir.

403
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,580
You know how to get Oki.

404
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:23,940
You're safe.

405
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,720
Oh, that was good block though.

406
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:28,880
Oh, he's killing himself now.

407
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,740
Yeah, that's fine.

408
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:29,980
That's fine.

409
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,120
Just block it out because he's gonna jump.

410
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,320
Oh my God.

411
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,060
You're so lucky.

412
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,340
Oh, he's killing him.

413
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,240
Oh my God, dude.

414
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,720
Almighty!

415
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,160
God, that damage is outrageous.

416
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,420
Don't burn yourself out and you win.

417
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,180
Oh my God!

418
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,380
Jackhammer!

419
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,380
Let's go.

420
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,720
Easy.

421
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,520
Easy.

422
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,660
Get down.

423
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,140
Get the fuck down.

424
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,980
That was so sick, dude.

425
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,020
Oh my God.

426
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,940
Oh my goodness.

427
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,660
Alright, Cole.

428
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,440
Are you gonna break our streak?

429
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,360
God, I need to go to the bathroom so bad.

430
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,820
I'm using this piss buff right now.

431
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,740
You can go.

432
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,380
You can stall.

433
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,900
Are you sure, man?

434
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,900
No, it's fine.

435
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,280
This is the piss buff.

436
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,100
This is it!

437
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,260
I'm about to show you right now.

438
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,180
Alright.

439
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,440
Are you gonna show us?

440
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
I don't know if I need to see it.

441
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,420
No, I'm talking about the performance.

442
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,000
Not anything else, you sicko.

443
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,700
Okay.

444
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,200
Let's go.

445
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,320
Oh, look at that above 1500 MR.

446
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,220
Flexing out a room.

447
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,560
Why do you leave the room, dude?

448
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,040
Gotta reflect.

449
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,020
Let's go, Cole.

450
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,520
Yes, sir.

451
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:52,780
Nice.

452
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,460
Nice.

453
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,520
Oh, that threw a loop.

454
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,800
Oh, no more loop.

455
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,360
A team of all grapplers.

456
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,820
That's this game, man.

457
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh my gosh.

458
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,180
What the fuck did I just watch?

459
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,780
Yes, sir.

460
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,720
Oh my goodness.

461
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,540
That's burnt.

462
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,640
Oh, nice!

463
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,660
That's the round.

464
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,900
Go, clean.

465
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,100
I really like Aki now.

466
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,840
Should be scooping.

467
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,840
Oh, I see the tricks.

468
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,340
Her movement is really cool in general.

469
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,660
Nice defense.

470
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,140
You're good.

471
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
How can he be part of the Fee Fighters when he's playing character with shoes?

472
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,680
Not committed to a bit.

473
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,900
Nice jump out.

474
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,680
Does he have a car?

475
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,840
Did you cross him with no shoes too?

476
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,120
Yes.

477
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,040
He's a fraud.

478
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,880
He needs to lock in.

479
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,840
Oh my god, look at the anti-airs.

480
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,020
That's fine, he's burnt.

481
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,720
You're in control.

482
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,380
Yep.

483
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,240
I messed up.

484
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,880
That's cool.

485
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,600
That's fine.

486
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,980
It's all right, we give those one round.

487
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,380
Just to make them feel better.

488
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,400
Nice.

489
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,720
Nice big throws.

490
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,750
Yeah, I almost had it.

491
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,970
It's all good, man.

492
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,250
That was close.

493
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,750
Oh, nice.

494
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:48,830
Poison him.

495
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,010
One more.

496
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,330
He's scared.

497
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,410
Very nice.

498
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,250
I saw the vision.

499
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,230
You got the new toy.

500
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:57,570
Yeah.

501
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,610
I'm going to get it today, coach.

502
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,230
I'm going to get it.

503
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,630
He had to tech chat.

504
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,970
He had to tech.

505
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,170
We'll know when he lands it.

506
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,510
Never mind.

507
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:16,930
Nice defense, man.

508
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,630
The control.

509
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,690
Yes, sir.

510
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,550
Pop that poison.

511
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,010
Keep him in that corner.

512
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,170
Don't let him leave.

513
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,270
Lay down the puddle.

514
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:31,870
Yes, sir.

515
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,430
Set.

516
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,410
Play, baby.

517
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,250
Hold this.

518
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,010
It's all good.

519
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,610
One mistake he had to capitalize.

520
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,890
Yeah, he just wants to make him feel better.

521
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,340
I hate that.

522
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,340
Oh my god.

523
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,480
You're killing it, man.

524
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,020
Let's go.

525
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,940
The shimmy on the floor makes me so uncomfortable.

526
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,680
Get off the floor.

527
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,960
Oh, what the fuck was that?

528
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,320
Dude, your movement is so good.

529
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:13,860
Yeah.

530
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,500
That was crazy.

531
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,640
The slithers.

532
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,700
Nice.

533
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,660
That's good.

534
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,000
Good news for the medium punch.

535
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,560
True.

536
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,140
Yes, sir.

537
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,080
Nice.

538
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
Yes, sir.

539
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,080
Just can't do anything.

540
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,380
Yep.

541
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,960
Very nice.

542
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,120
Oh my god.

543
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,980
It's getting cooked.

544
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,980
That shit's so tilting, too.

545
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,480
Oh my god.

546
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,820
Roll loops are cool when your teammates is over.

547
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,440
Yeah.

548
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,980
Let's get it.

549
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,240
Oh my gosh.

550
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,680
He needs a miracle.

551
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,180
We're good.

552
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,840
No miracle for him.

553
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,180
Oh my goodness.

554
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,000
Nice job.

555
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,480
Nice.

556
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,000
You're dealing with the fireballs.

557
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,920
Your anti-fireball movement was so much better already.

558
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,020
And you jumped out of the corner like 30 billion times like I told you.

559
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,600
Let's go.

560
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,720
That was so good.

561
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,940
Awesome.

562
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,560
Nice.

563
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,140
Now you can go pee.

564
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,800
You don't have to watch the coach.

565
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,400
Okay.

566
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,940
Did he leave already?

567
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,360
Sorry.

568
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,800
Sorry.

569
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,240
Okay.

570
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,120
Just keep it chill.

571
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,720
We'll just cheer you on.

572
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,580
Just keep it chill.

573
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,100
I'm going to lower you guys volume for me.

574
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,580
Okay.

575
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,620
We won't make you laugh.

576
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,020
Top tier.

577
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,040
JV trying to get those five points.

578
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,800
Those five points for his team.

579
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,160
They need it.

580
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,440
Wait.

581
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,180
Didn't we have 36 yesterday?

582
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,780
We already have half of the points.

583
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:02,980
We already have half of the points.

584
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,540
We had 39.

585
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,220
But like the other teams...

586
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,980
Oh my goodness.

587
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,820
Yeah, we did really good.

588
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,840
Also, Bronpo, Fumi got a point off Roy.

589
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,760
It's possible.

590
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,840
I remember you played around with Fumi.

591
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,080
I remember you played around with Fumi.

592
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,100
So maybe he can get a point off Roy too.

593
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:22,660
So maybe he can get a point off Roy too.

594
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,200
I believe.

595
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,100
Sorry stream.

596
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,160
I left you on read.

597
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,080
Well, they started when I didn't realize.

598
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,860
It's all right.

599
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,220
Dragon Ball Z time for you.

600
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,860
Dragon Ball Z.

601
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,160
Super fast water.

602
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:43,800
Nice.

603
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,500
Nice grab.

604
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,940
Punish kill.

605
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,700
Okay.

606
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,780
There you go.

607
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,800
Oh my god.

608
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,480
That's insane.

609
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,800
That's insane.

610
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,360
Nice.

611
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,300
Oh my god.

612
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,420
This is what happens when we don't distract the coach.

613
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,920
Yeah.

614
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,640
I feel so bad now.

615
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,980
We're holding it back.

616
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,620
Oh, that was good.

617
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,840
Rashid is so obnoxious.

618
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,440
Oh my god.

619
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,530
Whose idea was it?

620
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,850
Holy shit.

621
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,850
We can't have conversations.

622
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,330
We can't talk about it.

623
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,050
Oh, my bad.

624
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,510
Okay, sorry.

625
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,490
He needs full focus, especially against Rashid.

626
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,480
Fall.

627
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,440
Into the ball you go.

628
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,120
Into the ball you go.

629
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,020
How does he hit it every time?

630
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,440
How does he hit it every time?

631
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,060
Oh my god.

632
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,440
This is why he's meta.

633
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,140
Look at that pretty boy right there.

634
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,680
Look at him.

635
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
He slowed the fight down.

636
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,680
I can actually see it.

637
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,280
Oh my goodness.

638
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,140
Okay, what do you do here?

639
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,300
Just block it?

640
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,220
I think so.

641
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:10,580
That's fine.

642
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,320
We'll take those.

643
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,840
Yeah, it's just one little hit.

644
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,440
He can steamroll like this.

645
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,720
That's Rashid's special.

646
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,880
Oh no.

647
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,950
No, you did really good though.

648
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,410
Yeah, you're in his head.

649
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,010
You're in his head.

650
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,750
You played really good though.

651
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,410
If Rashid was slightly worse, you would have won that.

652
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,330
Yeah, if he was rank 121, you would have won that.

653
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,180
Oh god.

654
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,780
Look at my watching.

655
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,720
Rashid, bro.

656
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,160
So stupid.

657
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,900
He's super hard to play too, right?

658
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,800
No, not really.

659
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,600
Oh.

660
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,520
Why aren't we playing Rashid?

661
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,500
Because he's stupid.

662
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,940
Oh, nice.

663
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,820
Oh, here we go.

664
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,300
Nice.

665
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,580
I think that's it.

666
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,420
Yeah, it's over.

667
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,540
So dumb.

668
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,540
I hope Capcom butchers this character, bro.

669
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,380
I hope Capcom is watching.

670
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,400
They're most likely watching.

671
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,240
And then before they nerf instead.

672
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,220
It's Geef's time to shine.

673
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,480
Nice.

674
00:24:59,480 --> 00:24:59,800
Nice.

675
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,450
I'm so close.

676
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,150
Oh yeah, here we go.

677
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,670
Level 2.

678
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,670
Let's go to the corner.

679
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,870
Fuck it, we ball.

680
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,450
Ball time.

681
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,530
Oh, you're mine.

682
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,570
Oh my goodness.

683
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,290
Oh, the bait.

684
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,890
That's dead.

685
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,310
That's dead.

686
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:29,930
Stand still.

687
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,990
Hey, stand still.

688
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:32,650
Yeah.

689
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,190
You have the right to remain silent.

690
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,000
Nice.

691
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,780
Oh, I don't know if you can get anything out of that.

692
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,280
I don't play it.

693
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,740
Oh, okay.

694
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,160
Oh, God.

695
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:47,880
Here we go.

696
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,980
Tornado's coming.

697
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:49,920
Tornado warning.

698
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,760
Tornado warning.

699
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,580
Oh, nice.

700
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,460
There you go.

701
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,920
To the corner.

702
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,460
Your teammate left the lobby.

703
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,260
Fuck it, we ball.

704
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,840
Oh, he didn't do the big one.

705
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:06,910
Oh, yes.

706
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,670
Oh.

707
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,250
Oh.

708
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,790
Nice hit.

709
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,770
Oh my gosh.

710
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,410
Oh.

711
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,930
Just get out.

712
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,230
That's what I'm talking about.

713
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,370
Let's fucking go.

714
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,730
Dude, this is like a night and day difference from fucking Wednesday 2.

715
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,990
Yeah.

716
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,030
He's playing so good.

717
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,630
The coach is like Batman, dude.

718
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,010
Just some prep work is all he needs.

719
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:33,650
He can beat anyone.

720
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,150
He just needs us to shut up.

721
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,570
That's it.

722
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,040
Oh, nice grab.

723
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,260
Yes, sir.

724
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,420
He's so good.

725
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:48,960
That was good.

726
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,860
Oh, yes.

727
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,600
Okay, that's insane.

728
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,120
Oh, yeah.

729
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,320
Mix up.

730
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,540
Oh, he started dancing.

731
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,860
Oh, my God.

732
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,880
That fireball is so stupid.

733
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,820
What the fuck?

734
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,020
Nice.

735
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,260
Nice.

736
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,520
Nice.

737
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,740
Get him.

738
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,860
Let's go.

739
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,360
That's insane.

740
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,240
I think that's death.

741
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:17,820
Maybe.

742
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,440
I don't know.

743
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,020
Just barely.

744
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,780
He's scared.

745
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,260
What the fuck?

746
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,440
How does he predict that?

747
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,040
Just barely.

748
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,640
He's so scared.

749
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,020
Oh, God.

750
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm so scared.

751
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,800
Oh, no.

752
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, God.

753
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,840
You're sick, man.

754
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,700
You're sick.

755
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,020
My booty hole is so clenched right now.

756
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,340
Oh, my God.

757
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,430
Okay, hold on.

758
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,400
Oh, my goodness.

759
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,140
The corner.

760
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,800
You'll just never be in the corner against Rashid.

761
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,100
That's very hard.

762
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,140
Yeah.

763
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,940
What the fuck am I looking at?

764
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,940
What the fuck?

765
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,720
Locking in.

766
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,280
Locking in.

767
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,680
Yeah, we're locking in.

768
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:16,940
Let's go.

769
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,320
They're both adapting to each other.

770
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,840
Here we go.

771
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,680
Touch the toes.

772
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,280
Don't let him touch the floor.

773
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:41,750
Pull.

774
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:44,770
Ah,

775
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,220
the burnout.

776
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,180
It's hard.

777
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,160
Oh, no.

778
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,100
Oh, nice.

779
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,440
Oh, nice.

780
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:06,740
Oh, good punish.

781
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,620
Good punish.

782
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,300
Nice try.

783
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,940
That was close.

784
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,160
That was so close.

785
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,280
That was way better than last time.

786
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,340
Incredible set, dude.

787
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,180
One of the undefeated.

788
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,980
It's okay.

789
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,560
That was awesome.

790
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,420
That's all right.

791
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,760
They needed those points anyway.

792
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,020
But, no.

793
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,580
That fight was incredible.

794
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,060
Yeah.

795
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,120
That was insane.

796
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,680
That was so good.

797
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,360
Rashid is so...

798
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,300
I will forever be a Rashid hater for the rest of my life.

799
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,260
That was so close.

800
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,080
That was good.

801
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
That was a good match.

802
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,020
It was.

803
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,300
It was.

804
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,360
I knew when you got him in the corner, I was like, dude, he's going to jump out.

805
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,180
And he did.

806
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,040
Fuck.

807
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,200
And he did.

808
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,140
But that was so hard to stop Rashid from jumping out.

809
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,940
It's just part of it.

810
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,380
Yeah.

811
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,160
Yeah, because he can mix up his timing of coming down and...

812
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,780
Oh, God.

813
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
He needs a wall jump.

814
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,480
Yeah, that shit is...

815
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,360
There's too much stuff going on.

816
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,520
That was awesome.

817
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,480
Yeah, against a rank 120?

818
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,120
That shit was insane.

819
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,800
We got to stop, Dokie.

820
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,520
We got to stop.

821
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,940
You're killing me every time you talk about their rank.

822
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,600
I'm not going to lie.

823
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,680
That rank...

824
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,080
Don't...

825
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,680
Let's just move on.

826
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,260
That's not the point.

827
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:11,820
It's JB.

828
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,420
It's just JB.

829
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
It's just Nephew.

830
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,020
We'll beat their asses.

831
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,620
You don't understand.

832
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,140
He's rank 110.

833
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:19,880
Yeah.

834
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,460
Those numbers are so not important.

835
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,580
Oh, man.

836
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,900
Those are so unimportant ones.

837
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,320
This is the difference with fighting games.

838
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,760
We're just human and we're going to beat their asses.

839
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:35,820
Not wrong.

840
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:35,820
Not wrong.

841
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,320
I don't care if you're number one or number 210.

842
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,480
You're getting your ass beat.

843
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,520
There we go.

844
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,020
That was good shit.

845
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,800
I think everybody played way fucking better.

846
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,120
Like, it's crazy.

847
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,860
Yeah, I think we played pretty good.

848
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,120
That set the tone.

849
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,300
I think we're in a good spot.

850
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,540
Dude, I'm surprised with the SK.

851
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,660
SK made that adaptation like on the fly.

852
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,380
That was sick.

853
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,400
Yeah.

854
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,180
They started beating up on DPs and...

855
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,480
Oh, that was awesome.

856
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,840
Doki, you let her get a chance.

857
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,580
Yeah, that was insanity.

858
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, my God.

859
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,440
Finally.

860
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,560
And then BrawlPro over there styling.

861
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,980
It's like, all right, let me play.

862
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,880
I'm in training room right now.

863
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,180
You're just like, I also got coached.

864
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,640
I got coached by Justin.

865
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,800
Damn, I got to get coached by Justin now, too.

866
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,020
Hey, I coach all of you and you're all winning.

867
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:29,980
True.

868
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,340
But we can take it one step further beyond.

869
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,460
Every game plan that happened today was me telling you guys what to do.

870
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,860
Let's remember this.

871
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,180
Justin is out here teaching you drive rush DP OS shit that nobody does.

872
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,560
Yeah, I got coached by Brian.

873
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,540
A little bit of credit would be nice.

874
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,480
No, no, no.

875
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,380
I wrote the documents you guys aren't reading.

876
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,200
I made the video.

877
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,220
I read the documents.

878
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,400
Doki, you did not read that document.

879
00:31:59,660 --> 00:31:59,820
I did.

880
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,220
I actually did.

881
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,300
I made you a whole Modern Geek video guide.

882
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,440
You did not watch it.

883
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,200
I watched it, coach, just to let you know.

884
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,380
Oh, he did not make a video.

885
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,840
Oh, she didn't watch it.

886
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,460
Oh, my God.

887
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,300
I'm going to watch this fucking video right now.

888
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,100
I'm just saying, coach.

889
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,960
Gremlin is awake at 4 in the morning only.

890
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,120
I made a whole video because we could never meet up.

891
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,220
You made a video?

892
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,920
I saw the document.

893
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,080
No, Sha, you didn't see it?

894
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,360
No, I just saw the document.

895
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,480
I just saw the document.

896
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,720
Dude, he did a hand cam and everything, bro.

897
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:33,780
What?

898
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,900
You did a hand cam?

899
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,860
Okay, okay.

900
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,500
I'll watch the video tonight.

901
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,080
So, I'll join the finals.

902
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,300
I'll be even better.

903
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,200
I'll be even better.

904
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,240
I know you didn't watch it.

905
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,900
I knew from the beginning.

906
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,580
I was like, I made this.

907
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,460
But I didn't read.

908
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,420
I didn't read, though.

909
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,260
Read back the documents.

910
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,760
The documents.

911
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,960
Let the record show that there is a video, Your Honor.

912
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,720
10 minutes long, to be exact.

913
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
With a hand cam.

914
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,740
If I say, hey, Doki, in the beginning of it...

915
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,480
That shit is unlisted, alright?

916
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,040
It's okay.

917
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,180
I'm going to watch it.

918
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,360
I'm going to watch it before the finals.

919
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,020
And then it'll be like night and day.

920
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,600
Well, listen.

921
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,380
You didn't watch it and you're kicking ass.

922
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,580
So, maybe it's all for the best.

923
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,180
Whatever path we took to get here, it's working out.

924
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,820
Not wrong.

925
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,540
Dude, if she watches the video, all of a sudden she's doing like crazy-ass mix-ups.

926
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,400
No, that video is like really...

927
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,420
You're actually beyond that video.

928
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,700
I was extra baby mode.

929
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,920
I was like, this is a triangle.

930
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,820
This is a circle.

931
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,800
Like the blocks.

932
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,560
Sorry about it.

933
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,960
The triangle goes in the triangle hole.

934
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,020
Yeah, it was pretty much color and shape matching.

935
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,960
And that was about it.

936
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,240
So, we're good.

937
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,420
Nice.

938
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,800
Well, I think we're doing pretty good.

939
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,020
We clean house.

940
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,660
Holy shit.

941
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,900
Did any of them get any...

942
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,480
Just JB.

943
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,580
Like a game.

944
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,200
Oh yeah, I lost the first round.

945
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,440
Yeah, but you adapted.

946
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,640
You had a better game plan.

947
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,900
Just clean it up.

948
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,560
I didn't expect them to wake up DB every single time.

949
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,460
Yeah.

950
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,140
If I tell you someone's going to do something every time, just believe it.

951
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,200
Until it's really proven otherwise.

952
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,980
Because they are just going to do it.

953
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,300
Especially if they're like gold or whatever.

954
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,640
They will literally do it every time.

955
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,240
They can't help it.

956
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,460
Practice that stun combo.

957
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,560
Yeah, I'm doing it right now.

958
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,640
It was just the nerves.

959
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,040
I hit it every time in training.

960
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,200
I feel you.

961
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,800
I've dropped yesterday.

962
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,320
I don't know if you know SK with the stun combo, but you can walk forward first and then jump forward.

963
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,900
You have a lot of time before you have to do the jump in.

964
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,540
So don't rush it.

965
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,020
You can walk forward for one Mississippi and then jump.

966
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,280
Oh, okay.

967
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,160
Yeah, the stun lasts a while.

968
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,220
Yeah.

969
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,080
Where are we up next?

970
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,740
You have time to breathe.

971
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,660
We have Team Shine.

972
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,020
Oh, Team Shine.

973
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,900
So I'm playing...

974
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,520
I don't remember that one.

975
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,920
The Ed Blitz.

976
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,300
The Abundance of Ed Blitz.

977
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,680
Team Shine is...

978
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,220
Kana Yanagi.

979
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,760
So I'm playing against Bison again.

980
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,620
That was Bison, right?

981
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,240
Bright Shield and Fumi, I think, are the two Eds.

982
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,600
And then Infernasu, Akuma, and then Shine, which he'll play me with Ed or Kim.

983
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,200
Or Kim, yeah.

984
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,760
So...

985
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,440
Added an Eddy over there.

986
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:35,940
Yeah.

987
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,180
All his teammates wanted to copy him.

988
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,140
That's pretty cute, though.

989
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,500
Well, actually, they wanted to do the combo I'm doing, the level 2 combo.

990
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,620
Shine was like, oh, I didn't beat him, but I landed it on him.

991
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,840
He's like, you're wasting your minds.

992
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,640
Like, all they want to do now is...

993
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,440
Level 2?

994
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Hey, it worked.

995
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,080
Poisoned the well, coach.

996
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,660
Good job.

997
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,440
Let's go.

998
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,380
Oh, Chad is snitching.

999
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,460
They said Fumi has a JP pocket.

1000
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,880
So that would be against...

1001
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,640
Me?

1002
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:07,980
No.

1003
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,340
Uh-oh.

1004
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,500
I actually haven't had that hard of a time against JP, I'm not gonna lie.

1005
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,660
Well, you played JP too, right, coach?

1006
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,360
Yeah, I played a lot of JP.

1007
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,160
But that is an annoying matchup, right?

1008
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,300
It is, yeah.

1009
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,460
It can be, but it also can go both ways.

1010
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,240
Like, you can steamroll the fuck out of JP if they're not precise.

1011
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,360
So, I wouldn't be too scared.

1012
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,440
If you're getting zoned out real hard, we can take a breather and talk about it.

1013
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,020
But I wouldn't put it off your game plan.

1014
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,440
So, I know that you can amnesia regular grabs, but can you amnesia command grabs?

1015
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,160
Yes, it beats everything besides projectiles.

1016
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,280
In Season 1, it was unscaled and you got full combos.

1017
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,860
That was great, I remember that.

1018
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,900
It did more damage than a wake-up level 3.

1019
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,520
If I did amnesia and you SPD'd me, I would just combo you for a full 60 seconds.

1020
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,880
Yeah, you'd be just juggled over and over.

1021
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,560
It was fun.

1022
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,000
Good times.

1023
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,380
You can still do that, but it's not worth it.

1024
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,000
I'll be right back.

1025
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:10,840
The combos now, the optimal combo if you wake up amnesia in the corner and they throw you, is just to back throw them.

1026
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,480
You can still do all the cool combos, but the scaling is so bad that you literally do more damage just throwing them.

1027
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,740
It's better for balance, but they made them definitely a little less saucy.

1028
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,320
Are there anybody still playing JP competitively?

1029
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,980
Most people dropped him.

1030
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,160
They also nerfed his anti.

1031
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,520
I think that's the main thing that sealed the deal.

1032
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:35,420
His crouch fierce used to be god crouch fierce anti-air, and now it randomly loses.

1033
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,840
And that's just too much.

1034
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:45,240
And his burst damage isn't as good as other characters, so it's like they're all jumping at you, your anti-air is sometimes losing, and then you can't go as ham on them.

1035
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,640
So for the most part, most top players dropped him.

1036
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,060
He's still good though.

1037
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,160
I'll be honest, I'm okay with this change, to be honest with you.

1038
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,420
Yeah, he was not a fan favorite, huh?

1039
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,040
Dude, people hated me.

1040
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,780
Season 1 of Street Fighter VI, I got so many haters just for playing JP.

1041
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,340
Yeah, people did not like JP, dude.

1042
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,860
It did long-term damage to my brand.

1043
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,160
Really?

1044
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,020
Straight up, dude.

1045
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,960
Street Fighter VI is hot, brand new, great, woo.

1046
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,200
Content should take off, right?

1047
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,140
I had a lot of people just fucking hate me.

1048
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,880
Because you played JP?

1049
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,540
Like, straight up.

1050
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,940
This guy's never won a tournament in his life.

1051
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,580
He's never played Street Fighter before, he's been spamming.

1052
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:25,820
Damn!

1053
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,440
I've earned the shit on my YouTube channel.

1054
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:28,860
That's like crazy.

1055
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,620
Damn, dude.

1056
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,180
Yeah.

1057
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,360
Dear God.

1058
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,240
Good guys.

1059
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,220
Uh, let's see here.

1060
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,800
So are we ready for the EDs?

1061
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:42,780
So...

1062
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,020
I gotta worry about Akuma, that little bitch.

1063
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,800
I hate him.

1064
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,640
So for Doki, for Kanna...

1065
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:51,960
Yeah?

1066
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,120
My only notes were like, she just jumps all day.

1067
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,440
Yeah, yeah.

1068
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,580
And jumping forwards.

1069
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,080
So DI randomly is not as good against her.

1070
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,340
But, you know, down triangle or your jump air-to-air triangle would be good.

1071
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,360
She literally like jumps backwards, bunny hops, and then jumps forward.

1072
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,700
So you can like walk her down, and then when she jumps at you, do your anti-air.

1073
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,840
Okay.

1074
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,580
The person I'm fighting does flicker on every knockdown.

1075
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,980
Is there anything I can do about that?

1076
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,420
They do the charge one?

1077
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,600
Yeah, yeah.

1078
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,300
To like pull you in?

1079
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,120
Yeah, so this is Bright Shield.

1080
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,240
Okay, so...

1081
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, her anti-airs are mad good.

1082
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,780
Don't jump at her.

1083
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,080
But the charge flicker...

1084
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,680
She likes to start by doing backdash in charge flicker.

1085
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,880
So why don't you backdash and build your fireballs?

1086
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:39,780
Okay.

1087
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,160
In the beginning.

1088
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,160
Yeah, because you can back away from her even further.

1089
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,940
And then the flicker will whiff at max range.

1090
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,900
You just...

1091
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,460
1, 2, 3, build all your fireballs.

1092
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,500
And then you know what to do.

1093
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,400
Throw them out and drive her in.

1094
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,380
But if she pulls you in...

1095
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,020
She usually just throws you over and over.

1096
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,460
Or you can backdash.

1097
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,960
You can try to backdash away from it.

1098
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,880
Throw attack or OD DP.

1099
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,860
If I backdash, do I get to punish?

1100
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,140
Not...

1101
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,660
mid-screen, I don't believe.

1102
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
But you can press a button first.

1103
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,700
Okay.

1104
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,620
What if I jump?

1105
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,960
If you jump, she's going to modern DP you.

1106
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,740
Oh yeah, good point.

1107
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,240
Anyone else, like not modern, not her...

1108
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:19,900
would say jump.

1109
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,400
They'd fuck up the uppercut.

1110
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,300
But she actually uppercutted every time.

1111
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,120
It was kind of crazy.

1112
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,420
She never stopped DI though.

1113
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,580
I cheesed her so hard.

1114
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,680
Yeah.

1115
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,840
The other thing was she would do light kick, light kick.

1116
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,400
With add that 1, 2.

1117
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,260
And it has like the air wisp effect.

1118
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,740
And then throw you after.

1119
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,700
That's negative.

1120
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,380
That's your turn.

1121
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,640
With light move only or with medium move?

1122
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,380
Negative 3.

1123
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,320
You can press stand medium.

1124
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,920
Let's go to the lobby real quick.

1125
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,920
Wait, are you using Chun-Li or Juri?

1126
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,960
I'm Juri gaming today.

1127
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,100
Let's go.

1128
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,180
I have the lobby open.

1129
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
Join my lobby real quick.

1130
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,260
Password 1, 2, 3, 4.

1131
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,880
If you can search me up.

1132
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,980
How do I input a password?

1133
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,120
Search for my name.

1134
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,360
You can search lobbies.

1135
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,980
Or what's your name again?

1136
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,720
I don't know how to search for a lobby.

1137
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,220
I'm kind of on the same.

1138
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,320
What's your in-game love, Reyna?

1139
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,280
Yes, I love Reyna.

1140
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,140
How do you spell that?

1141
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,140
Oh, Reyna.

1142
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,520
You don't know how to spell Reyna?

1143
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,560
Not tech and play, eh?

1144
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,060
R-E-I-N-A.

1145
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,940
How could you?

1146
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,520
R-E-I-N-A?

1147
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,020
I said that.

1148
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,540
Is it one word?

1149
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,900
Yeah, one word.

1150
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,700
It's one word, yeah.

1151
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,420
Let me see if I can find you guys.

1152
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,280
I can't believe this.

1153
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,560
Juri!

1154
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:45,680
Juri!

1155
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,860
Juri!

1156
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,440
Juri!

1157
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,780
The annoying thing about this is it's even hard to add people as friends.

1158
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,480
I have you here.

1159
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,680
I guess I can add you now as a friend.

1160
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,780
A matchmaking error has occurred.

1161
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,340
I backed out.

1162
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,960
Oh, that would do it.

1163
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,880
I followed you.

1164
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,660
Oh fuck, I kicked you.

1165
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:07,920
That's funny.

1166
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,820
I think you can rejoin.

1167
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,560
I'll re-invite.

1168
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,200
My bad.

1169
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,500
First you don't know how to spell Reina.

1170
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,600
And then you kick me.

1171
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:19,920
That's fucked.

1172
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,420
I want a different team.

1173
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,260
I'm out of here.

1174
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,980
Damn, alright.

1175
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,700
Maybe when I played Tekken for a week I didn't really like the cut of her jib.

1176
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,180
You know what I'm saying?

1177
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,140
And now you're...

1178
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,880
It's over.

1179
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,940
She's going to throw down.

1180
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,000
She's not a very nice lady.

1181
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,980
Justin is my real coach.

1182
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,500
Fighting Rashid poisoned the well.

1183
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,820
Oh my god.

1184
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,700
This lady is not very nice.

1185
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,580
She's proud of me.

1186
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,340
I never said that, coach.

1187
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,500
There's a couple things you should not do in this tournament.

1188
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,460
And that's dis Reina.

1189
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,960
Disrespect Reina in front of SK.

1190
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,320
My bad.

1191
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,740
Oh, I think we're up.

1192
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,180
We got a second.

1193
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,820
So just block this move.

1194
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,640
So if I...

1195
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,780
Just press stand medium punch or jab.

1196
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,600
So the only options you have are like your jabs or stand medium.

1197
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,200
Oh my god, Nephew lost his first game!

1198
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,220
Hey!

1199
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,440
The diaphone beat him.

1200
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,660
He can bleed!

1201
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,820
She would also do this.

1202
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,040
He can bleed.

1203
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,780
And he's legend 72 or whatever.

1204
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,640
I didn't say any numbers.

1205
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,860
Can you believe it?

1206
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,680
It's also like really insulting to the players.

1207
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,680
You've been saying it over and over.

1208
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:50,300
Like to call Nephew online ranked number 72.

1209
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,960
Like that is extremely insulting.

1210
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:53,960
Let's go!

1211
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,560
We found the nerve!

1212
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,940
Let's poke it!

1213
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,900
Yeah, that's just tilting me.

1214
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,440
It's not them.

1215
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,680
They don't hear a damn shit.

1216
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,960
We're nerfing him!

1217
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,720
I didn't say it!

1218
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,320
I didn't say it!

1219
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,000
I stopped.

1220
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,640
So if I throw you...

1221
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,900
I can't really do it there.

1222
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,120
Maybe jump at me?

1223
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,500
I'm gonna do it again.

1224
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh, I suck.

1225
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,500
I lost my uppercuts.

1226
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,080
I'm gonna do this.

1227
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,940
I'm gonna pull you in.

1228
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,440
They're getting ready to send invites.

1229
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,580
Just jump at me.

1230
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,560
Alright, back.

1231
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,000
Sorry.

1232
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,720
The other thing you can do is if it's that close, you can DI.

1233
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,020
Okay.

1234
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,780
So if I'm this close, DI.

1235
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,180
This far, it's risky.

1236
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,360
Got it.

1237
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,100
But if it's like right here, you can try DI.

1238
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:49,580
Whoa!

1239
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,700
Invites out.

1240
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,600
The thing is, if you block it, she likes to throw you after.

1241
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,080
That's fine.

1242
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,200
Okay, let's go join the invites.

1243
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,960
I don't know how to leave.

1244
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,920
Oh, you beat me up.

1245
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,500
I already have a round.

1246
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,580
Yeah, beat me up.

1247
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:10,090
What?

1248
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:12,430
Excuse me?

1249
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,890
Oh, I just learned that like 20 minutes ago.

1250
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,850
Excuse me?

1251
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,430
That was the combo.

1252
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,810
That was the real dry rush combo.

1253
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:21,710
That's the real one?

1254
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,090
That's the real one.

1255
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:23,870
That was for real.

1256
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,700
Who do we join?

1257
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,420
Is it Slamman?

1258
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,940
Probably Slamman.

1259
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,350
Online.

1260
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,030
What the fuck?

1261
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:47,610
What?

1262
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,530
I posted first.

1263
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,590
On my screen.

1264
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,390
I see you first too, Doki.

1265
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,170
Oh, it's Tails.

1266
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,510
Sorry, it's Tails.

1267
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:58,050
Collusion for us.

1268
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,130
Save by ping.

1269
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,430
Collusion for us.

1270
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:02,970
Let's go.

1271
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,790
Save by ping.

1272
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:07,710
Let's fucking go.

1273
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,170
This side swapping business.

1274
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,810
This is... yeah.

1275
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,490
SageM definitely poisoned your guys' brains by doing Tekken first.

1276
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:20,870
Everyone's a Tekken player in here.

1277
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:21,850
Right.

1278
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,150
Yeah, for all of us playing Tekken.

1279
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,730
Yeah, I can tell.

1280
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:28,670
It's obvious.

1281
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,230
It's so hard.

1282
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,770
It's like the moves...

1283
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,350
The button swap.

1284
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,310
It's weird.

1285
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,030
My fingers aren't used to that.

1286
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,230
To the swapping.

1287
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:41,830
Yeah, I get you.

1288
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,450
I'm teasing.

1289
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:43,170
It makes sense.

1290
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,290
I can't handle it.

1291
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,110
Let's go, Doki.

1292
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:51,970
Jumping.

1293
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,170
I don't understand why she hasn't...

1294
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:01,950
Yeah, she's just gonna walk back and randomly jump.

1295
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,070
Brace yourself.

1296
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,450
I'm on the other side.

1297
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,250
This is bad.

1298
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:08,150
Nice.

1299
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:12,370
Alright, we're good.

1300
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,210
Let's get clean.

1301
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,070
Let's game.

1302
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,550
Doki's a menace, dude.

1303
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:20,390
What?

1304
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,930
She's a menace, bro.

1305
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:27,170
She's a menace, bro.

1306
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:27,190
She's a menace, bro.

1307
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:27,590
It's all here.

1308
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,430
Just triangle.

1309
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,290
Just triangle.

1310
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,050
Okay.

1311
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,610
Okay.

1312
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:40,290
Yeah!

1313
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:41,690
Yeah!

1314
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:42,970
Condition.

1315
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:44,690
She's starting to...

1316
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,350
She's predicting that now.

1317
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,010
Oh, okay.

1318
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,430
She's mashing out a combo.

1319
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,790
It was tickle.

1320
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:53,130
You're good.

1321
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:56,750
Yeah.

1322
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:57,090
Yeah.

1323
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,630
Did level 3, but do you care?

1324
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:00,390
No, not really.

1325
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,170
Not at all.

1326
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:01,630
No.

1327
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,690
Who cares, dude?

1328
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:03,590
Just get in there.

1329
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:05,850
Oh, that's alright.

1330
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,510
Good idea.

1331
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,610
But she jumps again.

1332
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,890
She just does the same thing over and over.

1333
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,630
You know what to do.

1334
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:14,450
Okay.

1335
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:14,730
Okay.

1336
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,150
Oh, wait a minute.

1337
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:23,850
Okay.

1338
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,110
I got my own scissor kick, amigo.

1339
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:28,450
Oh.

1340
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:30,530
Unlucky.

1341
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,190
Yeah, we just block it out.

1342
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,450
You gotta wait for her to jump and down triangle.

1343
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,600
Oh, my God.

1344
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,620
Oh, my God.

1345
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,540
Oh, my God.

1346
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:42,640
Yo.

1347
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,440
Unlucky.

1348
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,140
Okay.

1349
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,460
Did she jump?

1350
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,120
Oh, my God.

1351
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,580
Oh, you got it.

1352
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,060
Oh, my God.

1353
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:52,520
Nice.

1354
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,020
Dude, watching Doki play is way better than anything on Disney Plus right now.

1355
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,860
This kid is crazy.

1356
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,460
Yeah.

1357
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,660
Holy shit.

1358
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,220
This is great.

1359
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,580
That was awesome.

1360
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:06,820
Good job.

1361
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,900
The only thing is the jump triangles.

1362
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,200
If you can do a down triangle, that'll get her every time.

1363
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,140
But if not, it's all good.

1364
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:15,800
Okay.

1365
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,780
Oh, my God.

1366
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,520
It doesn't even matter.

1367
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:21,380
Unlucky.

1368
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,760
I pressed the wrong button reflexively.

1369
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,220
Nice defense.

1370
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,120
Nice defense.

1371
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,860
That was so good.

1372
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,140
Perfect.

1373
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:31,660
Yeah.

1374
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,520
Great blocks.

1375
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,260
Nice.

1376
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,200
Get in there.

1377
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,460
Get in there.

1378
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,560
Press triangle.

1379
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:41,600
Yeah.

1380
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,200
After you land the command grab, just don't even do nothing.

1381
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,320
She wakes up DI there every time.

1382
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:46,620
Okay.

1383
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,900
Oh, I didn't even realize that.

1384
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,340
Burned out.

1385
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,760
Yeah.

1386
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:51,460
Nice.

1387
00:49:59,160 --> 00:49:59,640
Let's go.

1388
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,120
Oh, my God.

1389
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:07,540
If you land a triangle, just don't attack her after.

1390
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,600
That's the only thing.

1391
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,240
All right.

1392
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:09,920
Everything else is perfect.

1393
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,220
Yeah, that's fine.

1394
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,500
What do I do here?

1395
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,540
You just block.

1396
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,240
You know, she's gonna just jump at you randomly.

1397
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,360
Just block it out a little bit.

1398
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:23,700
Okay.

1399
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:25,980
Okay, you're good.

1400
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:26,720
Exactly.

1401
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,080
See?

1402
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,540
Oh, whoops.

1403
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:32,600
Okay.

1404
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:33,760
Nice.

1405
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,120
Ah, I need to remember to...

1406
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,160
See, she does that every time.

1407
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:36,220
Yeah.

1408
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,300
Every time you knock her down, she's gonna wake up with that.

1409
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:38,480
Yeah.

1410
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,900
So, when we knock her down...

1411
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,360
Let's do it back.

1412
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,960
My loyal fans!

1413
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,700
Okay, so she's probably gonna wake up with the DI again.

1414
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,300
Yeah.

1415
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,980
So you can walk up and jump over her or walk up and block.

1416
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,120
But don't do a big move.

1417
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,640
Oh, okay.

1418
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,280
Nice.

1419
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,340
Wait, is this death?

1420
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,060
No.

1421
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,980
I get it.

1422
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:00,620
Yeah!

1423
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,160
Let's go, Doki!

1424
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:04,940
Let's go!

1425
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,340
Yeah!

1426
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,240
I'm gold!

1427
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,220
I'm gold!

1428
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,160
I'm a gold player!

1429
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,120
I'm a gold player.

1430
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,580
I'm a gold player.

1431
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,540
I don't need a rank.

1432
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,040
Yeah, just don't even worry about rank, dude.

1433
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,780
I don't need rank.

1434
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,580
It hurts them even more to lose to a lower-ranked player.

1435
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,340
Exact mind games!

1436
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,060
Yes!

1437
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,280
Just be a new challenger.

1438
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,400
Just make a new account.

1439
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,300
Just be a new challenger.

1440
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,220
Make a new account!

1441
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:31,400
Make a new account!

1442
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,800
You'll look like a smurf if you're on there.

1443
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,480
You'll look like a smurf if you're on there.

1444
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,300
I'll buy a new game.

1445
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,240
I'll buy a new game.

1446
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:43,960
Awesome time.

1447
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,220
I wonder what rank number you are, Doki.

1448
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,580
I'm rank 119.

1449
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,000
Damn.

1450
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,760
That's up there, Doki.

1451
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,800
Looks like his name is Med with that M there.

1452
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,460
Med, let's go!

1453
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,880
You know the game plan.

1454
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,520
Let's go.

1455
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,240
Yep, perfect.

1456
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,880
Exactly, yep.

1457
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,020
Nice.

1458
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,340
Nice.

1459
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,620
Oh, yes!

1460
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,140
Nice!

1461
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:21,780
Nice!

1462
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,060
Sick!

1463
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,200
That's alright.

1464
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,720
Oh, yay!

1465
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,660
My poor heart!

1466
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,300
That's fucking gold!

1467
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,260
She cheated against Chun-Li, not you!

1468
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,760
There you go, that's good.

1469
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,200
The lab work, hell yes.

1470
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,340
Oops.

1471
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,400
It's all good.

1472
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,680
That was good by her.

1473
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,380
Okay.

1474
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:57,980
Nice.

1475
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,400
Yeah, just save your meter a little bit.

1476
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,600
Like, just don't do anything.

1477
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,740
That's fine.

1478
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,680
We'll survive.

1479
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,880
Oh, goodbye cube.

1480
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:06,680
It's alright.

1481
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,320
You're alive, but you're in a bad situation.

1482
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:08,480
You're in a bad spot.

1483
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,620
But they spent the super early, so you're good.

1484
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,760
The comeback is real!

1485
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:16,760
Nice.

1486
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,120
Good job backing out of the range.

1487
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,140
If that happens again, just backdash and build your fireballs.

1488
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,900
And you're good.

1489
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:24,740
Okay.

1490
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,480
Yeah, she's giving you space.

1491
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,620
When she gives you all that space, just build a fireball.

1492
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:36,610
Nice.

1493
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:37,830
Okay.

1494
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:40,790
Yeah!

1495
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:44,670
We can hit that on the right side every time, huh?

1496
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:45,610
Yup.

1497
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:48,590
That feels like a callout.

1498
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:50,550
Oh.

1499
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:51,830
I'm slow.

1500
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,470
Oh, she baited it.

1501
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:57,170
Oh my goodness.

1502
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:57,610
That's okay.

1503
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,350
You blocked it though.

1504
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,210
So let's just let her rock a little.

1505
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:01,190
Nice!

1506
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:01,950
Exactly.

1507
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:03,970
Oh, what the hell.

1508
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,390
Don't use that sweep anymore.

1509
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,250
You can't DI cancel it.

1510
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,650
Yeah, don't use sweep.

1511
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:13,570
Okay, back up.

1512
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,170
You can back up, and then...

1513
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,400
Nice.

1514
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,240
That's a good block.

1515
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,800
Oh, that was a good parry.

1516
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,600
Oh, that's close!

1517
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,580
That's close.

1518
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,140
It's fine.

1519
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:47,240
When you're approaching, you're gonna back up, you're gonna throw the fireball, and when she gives you space, just keep building fireball over and over and throwing it, and when you dry brush, you dry brush mediums.

1520
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,620
You're doing the big buttons, she's mashing DI.

1521
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,320
Do small buttons, like mediums.

1522
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,280
Yup, there you go!

1523
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,380
And then she mashes on wake up every time.

1524
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,380
And then she does DI.

1525
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,020
So just after, just let her wake up, and let her do DI.

1526
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,020
And then just counter DI.

1527
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,140
And you know what to do after that.

1528
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:09,520
See?

1529
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,040
Yeah, she's just doing DI over and over.

1530
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,080
Nice!

1531
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,180
She's gonna do DI.

1532
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,640
I'm just slow.

1533
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,540
That's cool.

1534
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,980
Let's just let her do DI and try to bait it.

1535
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,000
Okay, I will counter every single one.

1536
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,540
I believe!

1537
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,780
When you're up close to her, don't press buttons.

1538
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,700
Just don't press buttons when you're close to her.

1539
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,460
She's just mashing and then doing DI.

1540
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,420
Okay, just block.

1541
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,140
Don't do that.

1542
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,060
Just block.

1543
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,380
There you go.

1544
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:53,580
Yup.

1545
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,820
Nice.

1546
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,000
Yes!

1547
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,620
Nice!

1548
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,560
Oh, that's insane!

1549
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,400
That shit was insane!

1550
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,440
Good control.

1551
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,600
Let's go!

1552
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,400
Oh my god!

1553
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,520
That's what I'm talking about!

1554
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,220
Super?

1555
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,520
Oh no, that's okay.

1556
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,260
And now just back up.

1557
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:26,720
Just back up.

1558
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,540
She's gonna throw you.

1559
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,340
Oh, nice throw!

1560
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,260
You get one button on offense.

1561
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,140
And then you gotta stop and she's gonna DI.

1562
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,160
Download complete!

1563
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,280
Yeah, no meter spent.

1564
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,200
Lovely.

1565
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,900
Throw your fireball.

1566
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,520
And then that shields you.

1567
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,860
So you can drive her behind it.

1568
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,300
She's gonna DI.

1569
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,260
Yeah, don't press.

1570
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,620
Just let her jab, jab, jab.

1571
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,720
Yeah, that's fine.

1572
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,760
Okay, no problem.

1573
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,160
Composure.

1574
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,540
You have your super too.

1575
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,420
Okay.

1576
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:21,880
Nice.

1577
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,240
Oh, you can't do it out of that one move.

1578
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,600
Oh, it's alright, it's alright.

1579
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,440
Good try, SK.

1580
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,900
Good try, good try.

1581
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,280
It was way better than last time.

1582
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:33,800
That's for sure.

1583
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,400
You were adapting real good.

1584
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,100
Yeah.

1585
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,000
Good try.

1586
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,100
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

1587
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,200
Just don't do anything when you're next to her.

1588
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,440
No, I want to do things.

1589
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,420
I want to do things.

1590
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:42,800
Yeah.

1591
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,400
I didn't pay $70 for all the moves I was doing.

1592
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,340
Except the last one.

1593
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,180
I was just too slow.

1594
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,480
This kind of player, they don't...

1595
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,580
Oh boy, they're actually using JP.

1596
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,540
Oh, they're going for the JP.

1597
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:53,920
Oh, they are!

1598
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,380
Have they been training JP a lot?

1599
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,540
I haven't, so...

1600
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,300
I mean, they're Diamond 4, so...

1601
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,900
Yeah, they're pretty good.

1602
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,020
That's true.

1603
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,860
I mean, you know about his command grab, right, Brawl?

1604
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:08,840
Yes.

1605
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,860
Yeah, that's the only thing.

1606
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,780
Like, if you're pairing too much, you might try to command grab.

1607
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,660
So, just do what you got to do.

1608
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,680
And just be wary if he starts using that move a lot.

1609
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,120
And you're good.

1610
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,100
Fast forward into command grab.

1611
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,500
I love this move.

1612
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:22,460
Oh.

1613
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,290
Oh, nice!

1614
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,370
There we go.

1615
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,790
Oh, he's scared.

1616
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,310
She's scared, she's scared.

1617
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:39,950
Good blocks.

1618
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:40,630
Alright, you're good.

1619
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,390
The patience.

1620
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:48,410
Oh, yeah!

1621
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:49,850
Yee-haw!

1622
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:52,430
Yee-haw!

1623
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:55,050
Nice.

1624
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:58,410
Even when she counter-picked.

1625
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:01,290
Oh,

1626
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:11,150
nice.

1627
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,750
Oh, that was a good grab.

1628
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,110
That does so much damage.

1629
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,790
Yeah, the EX-1 is a lot.

1630
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,550
Oh, the overhead.

1631
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:24,850
No.

1632
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:25,250
No.

1633
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:25,890
Just parry.

1634
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:29,330
Bro, what the fuck?

1635
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,490
He just fills the screen with shit.

1636
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,170
Okay.

1637
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,810
Oh, wow, she got those.

1638
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,570
Oh, yeah, she definitely got those.

1639
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:50,810
Whoa.

1640
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,410
She adapted so fast.

1641
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,910
Which is really hard for Gief to get in.

1642
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:58,370
Yeah.

1643
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,630
You have to be real patient.

1644
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:03,610
Oh.

1645
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:04,890
Alright, just get...

1646
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:05,310
There you go.

1647
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:06,270
No more nose.

1648
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,870
And now we go in.

1649
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:09,210
Yeah!

1650
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:09,970
Party time.

1651
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:13,110
Just try not to whiff knee because they'll jump out.

1652
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,630
Nice!

1653
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:15,770
Oh, my God.

1654
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:16,470
Get them.

1655
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:18,270
One more and you get level three.

1656
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:20,530
Nice.

1657
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:23,770
You're right about the knee.

1658
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:24,610
You're right, you're right.

1659
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:25,850
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1660
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,270
Just parry, just parry, just parry.

1661
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,430
I said parry.

1662
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:33,650
You got this, man.

1663
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:35,750
You got this, amigo.

1664
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:36,570
Composure.

1665
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,030
Composure.

1666
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:43,010
Damn.

1667
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:44,330
Okay.

1668
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:46,730
When she does level two, just hold parry.

1669
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:47,750
Just hold parry.

1670
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:48,890
It's a high-low mix.

1671
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:49,630
You can't block it.

1672
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:54,830
And then when you parry a projectile, you can try threatening parry, hold parry, then dry brush in.

1673
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:57,990
And then she's just jumping when you're close.

1674
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:58,670
You got to larry it.

1675
01:00:59,070 --> 01:00:59,430
Okay.

1676
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:03,710
Nice.

1677
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:03,990
Get them.

1678
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,030
Don't do need SPD.

1679
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:08,770
Don't do none of that.

1680
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:09,450
She's just a jumper.

1681
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:13,830
Just everything, just buttons and lock her down until you're really confident about the SPD.

1682
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,590
Yeah.

1683
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,970
Try to jump out of the corner.

1684
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:17,670
Doesn't matter.

1685
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:21,090
Jesus.

1686
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:22,670
So much damage.

1687
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,430
So you can try dry rushing in if she does...

1688
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:26,870
Oh, no.

1689
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:28,230
That was an accident.

1690
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,560
That's so obnoxious.

1691
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:39,720
Yeah.

1692
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,140
You see why Bryan lost a little bit of reputation.

1693
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,520
Now I know why people hated him.

1694
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:49,580
Yeah.

1695
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,120
Watching this makes me angry.

1696
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,080
After you parry a fireball, dry brush at them.

1697
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,620
She's doing fireball, then setting the portal up above your head.

1698
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,300
So if you're at a distance and you absorb a fireball, then she does the portal, you dry brush in.

1699
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,880
If you don't dry brush in, you're never going to threaten anything.

1700
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,260
Okay.

1701
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,020
There you go.

1702
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:10,400
There you go.

1703
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:10,600
There you go.

1704
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,080
You could have let that go all the way.

1705
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,540
Just let the dry brush rock and get closer.

1706
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:13,900
Nice.

1707
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,580
Okay, here we go.

1708
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:19,400
Okay.

1709
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,320
Okay, conserve your meter.

1710
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,520
There you go.

1711
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,240
Free combo.

1712
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,140
Nice.

1713
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,240
Conserve your meter still.

1714
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,820
She's just a jumper, man.

1715
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,700
She just jumps.

1716
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,060
Okay.

1717
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:36,720
Jesus.

1718
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,520
Okay, you're good.

1719
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,500
Now you're exactly that.

1720
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,300
Exactly that.

1721
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,600
She throws fireball, then does portal.

1722
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:48,520
If she does that, you can just dry brush all the way fullscreen and attack.

1723
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:52,060
Nice.

1724
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,120
Remember, she just likes to jump on Oki.

1725
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,420
That's what she wants to do.

1726
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:58,460
Yeah.

1727
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,160
Okay, that's cool.

1728
01:02:59,180 --> 01:02:59,580
Exactly.

1729
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,880
Yep, she's going to still try to jump or do random cane swing.

1730
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,340
Oh, nice.

1731
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:05,660
What was that?

1732
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,040
See, she's still jumping.

1733
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,140
It was a counter.

1734
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,580
Hold parry, hold parry.

1735
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,760
Just hold parry.

1736
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,940
There you go.

1737
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:16,740
Let's go!

1738
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:17,300
Nice!

1739
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,620
Now you can threaten dry brush.

1740
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,120
Let's go!

1741
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:20,920
Whoa, whoa!

1742
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:21,840
I quit!

1743
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:24,780
The adaptation!

1744
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:25,860
That's going to be your best jump.

1745
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,160
We're in this.

1746
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,060
Hold parry, hold parry.

1747
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,540
When the portals are about to pop above your head, you can parry.

1748
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:38,380
Okay, you're good.

1749
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,120
Back in the corner you go, Migo.

1750
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,960
You know, buttons, pressure.

1751
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,600
I have to respect her a little more.

1752
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,180
Yeah, she's adapting to me.

1753
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:52,880
Yeah, there you go.

1754
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,480
Nice, nice.

1755
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,060
So parry.

1756
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,700
Yeah, when the portals are about to pop.

1757
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:58,300
Yeah, good dry brush.

1758
01:03:59,080 --> 01:03:59,440
Nice!

1759
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,160
Okay, just don't let her jump out.

1760
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,660
Yeah, just keep it solid.

1761
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:04,280
Keep her in there.

1762
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,760
Don't whip a knee.

1763
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:07,220
Just keep her caged.

1764
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:09,240
I see.

1765
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,060
Yeah, you got to do this the old-fashioned way.

1766
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:15,560
Yeah, you got to do this the old-fashioned way.

1767
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:16,880
Yeah.

1768
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,280
Yeah, I think this is where things get really bad.

1769
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:20,740
Yeah.

1770
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,900
So this is why don't use your defensive options with meter.

1771
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,060
Consider your meter.

1772
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,700
You need it for when you're zoned out.

1773
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:30,560
Nice.

1774
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,000
Nice.

1775
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:31,520
Nice.

1776
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:32,420
Okay.

1777
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,480
There you go.

1778
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:36,880
Yeah, exactly.

1779
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,780
She just wants to jump out or do random DI.

1780
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:39,660
Nice!

1781
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,520
There you go, get him!

1782
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,140
So just be aware.

1783
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,260
Told you!

1784
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,740
That's what you need, control.

1785
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,080
Keep them caged in the corner.

1786
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,940
Don't need to go for SPD over and over.

1787
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,120
Nice!

1788
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:57,640
Let's fucking go.

1789
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,240
Get that damage, amigo.

1790
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:02,380
Oh!

1791
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,040
Okay.

1792
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,060
Displace all defense.

1793
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:07,780
Yes.

1794
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,300
She has no two.

1795
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:11,800
It's all right.

1796
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,680
Just block, just block.

1797
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:13,660
Yeah, you're good.

1798
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,480
Yeah, she's just gonna try to jump over and over.

1799
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,300
Nice!

1800
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,260
Now you can stun her.

1801
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,280
Drive rush, crash medium.

1802
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,680
Let's go, baby!

1803
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:25,840
Let's go!

1804
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,280
Bro, bro, baby!

1805
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:29,780
Nice adaptation!

1806
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:32,220
Adaptation!

1807
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,780
Dude, you're playing disgusting, dude.

1808
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,420
On the fly, dude.

1809
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,020
I had no idea.

1810
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:41,460
I had no idea what to do in game one.

1811
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:42,440
Learn the matchup.

1812
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,260
You learned the matchup on the fly.

1813
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,020
That's so impressive.

1814
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:45,580
You have no idea.

1815
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,040
Yeah!

1816
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,800
That's the master player right there!

1817
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,280
Thank you for listening.

1818
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,760
Dude, you said stun her, but I almost did, but I'm like, no, she's gonna level three.

1819
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:57,960
That's fine, that's fine.

1820
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,940
You have better Oki reads than me.

1821
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,340
The only thing I know is she's jumping.

1822
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,460
And you're not antering.

1823
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,160
That's the only thing.

1824
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,420
You're the grappler player.

1825
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,060
I started to, thank God.

1826
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,220
All right, here we go.

1827
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,680
My heart, I hate the slam.

1828
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,740
Yeah, dude.

1829
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:17,900
I agree.

1830
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,560
So, you're not the tiebreaker anymore.

1831
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,420
It's easier.

1832
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,600
That is a little better, yes.

1833
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,220
The tiebreaker was unreal.

1834
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:27,540
Ugh.

1835
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,560
And you finally, you parried level two.

1836
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,060
Thank God.

1837
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:30,580
Oh my God.

1838
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:34,320
That shit's literally a high-low, left-right, like you have to parry.

1839
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:36,900
Okay.

1840
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:38,860
Let's go, go.

1841
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:40,580
Oh.

1842
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:57,990
Nice jump out.

1843
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:58,630
Let's go.

1844
01:06:59,070 --> 01:06:59,690
That's fine.

1845
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:00,970
It's all good.

1846
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:04,150
He's doing that medium kick to overhead turret combo a lot.

1847
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,650
It's just kind of a gimmick.

1848
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,290
So, just don't worry about it.

1849
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,090
Yeah.

1850
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:11,550
Nice.

1851
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,210
Nice tech.

1852
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:24,010
Nice.

1853
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:26,410
Yeah.

1854
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:27,790
Time to play, let's go.

1855
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:29,850
I love when he starts grabbing.

1856
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,090
I've heard grabs are so nice.

1857
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:31,490
Yeah.

1858
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:35,590
Typical Akuma bullshit.

1859
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:36,910
Fireball.

1860
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,110
He's low in drive meter.

1861
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:39,110
Yeah, that's cool.

1862
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:44,630
Nice.

1863
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:45,190
Nice.

1864
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:45,910
Let's go.

1865
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,670
That was a good jump.

1866
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,070
Nice.

1867
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:51,750
Nice prediction.

1868
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:53,770
Stun him immediately after this.

1869
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:55,670
Stun him.

1870
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:58,710
Yes, sir.

1871
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,150
Nice.

1872
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:03,350
Nice.

1873
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:03,770
Good drop.

1874
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,130
Nice K.O.

1875
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:05,510
Let's go.

1876
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:07,710
Yeah,

1877
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:21,070
every time he does medium kick, he's just going to overhead.

1878
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:24,290
There's so many blocking.

1879
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:26,350
This is a heavy defense game.

1880
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,070
Yeah, yeah.

1881
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,010
I mean, you saw my match.

1882
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:31,770
Like, what the fuck?

1883
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:36,870
It's a Roy practice for you.

1884
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:38,310
Nice.

1885
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:42,090
Yep.

1886
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:45,930
That's fine.

1887
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:46,350
That's fine.

1888
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:49,310
Oh, yes.

1889
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,350
He's almost burnt, too.

1890
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:55,310
What?

1891
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:57,210
That's spaghetti.

1892
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,050
Don't worry about it.

1893
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:58,650
You got lucky.

1894
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:07,980
Nice break.

1895
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:08,620
Oh, my gosh.

1896
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,220
Oh, that's close.

1897
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:15,380
When he demon flips and he comes down with the chop, he's plus there.

1898
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,180
So you keep getting hit and then he just goes into overhead.

1899
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:17,920
So just chill for a second.

1900
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:18,560
Don't hit rematch.

1901
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:19,620
Oh, sorry.

1902
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:26,660
And so just throw him into dry brush medium, dude.

1903
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,280
Like, you're respecting him too much.

1904
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:29,380
This guy is not going to fucking react.

1905
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,420
You can do stabby hands also to get over his zoning.

1906
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,020
He's not going to deal with any of that shit.

1907
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,660
Like, you're better than him.

1908
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:36,900
Just rush him down.

1909
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,120
That's fucking right.

1910
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:38,520
You're better.

1911
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,880
Rank up the offense.

1912
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,500
You know what to do.

1913
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,240
Yes, sir.

1914
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:48,920
Yes, sir.

1915
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:49,260
Let's go.

1916
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,060
That was just random.

1917
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:51,980
Don't worry about it.

1918
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,680
He got a lot out of that bullshit, though.

1919
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:57,520
Nice.

1920
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,260
Nice interruption.

1921
01:09:59,440 --> 01:09:59,800
Punish.

1922
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,060
Don't be scared to rush him down, man.

1923
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:08,020
After throw, do dry brush medium, dry brush heavy, and do stabby hands if it's zoning too much.

1924
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,960
This guy is not going to deal with it.

1925
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,420
Holy shit.

1926
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,680
I've never seen that move before.

1927
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,460
That's the stabby hands.

1928
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,460
Look how much damage this does.

1929
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,660
Get into your flow, bro.

1930
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,800
He's not going to know what to do.

1931
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,840
He's so confused.

1932
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,420
I'm confused, too.

1933
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,180
I'm not going to lie.

1934
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,840
I was like, wait.

1935
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,140
I've never seen that.

1936
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:31,400
Nice, sir.

1937
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,160
There you go.

1938
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:34,700
He's dead.

1939
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:35,160
Let's go.

1940
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,500
He's 100% dead.

1941
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,660
He's not going to know what to do.

1942
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,080
Just rush him down your normal game.

1943
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,000
Just don't play slow.

1944
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,440
If it's too slow, stabby hands.

1945
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,180
Got you.

1946
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,660
Let's go, man.

1947
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:47,680
No respect.

1948
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,620
One more.

1949
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:48,960
One more.

1950
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,340
Now he's scared.

1951
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,120
He's throwing so many.

1952
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,020
Okay.

1953
01:10:59,060 --> 01:10:59,280
Good.

1954
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,740
It's good that he punished that.

1955
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,280
Oh, shit.

1956
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,360
Damn.

1957
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:08,740
Jeez.

1958
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,020
Nice escape.

1959
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:11,660
Nice.

1960
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:21,350
What did he do there?

1961
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:24,450
Dive kick.

1962
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:27,430
Oh, you're both burned out.

1963
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:27,730
Okay.

1964
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:28,150
Nice.

1965
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:28,910
Nice back throw.

1966
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:30,570
Yep.

1967
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:31,150
He's not going to know what to do.

1968
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:32,330
That's fine.

1969
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:32,690
That's fine.

1970
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:32,810
Oh.

1971
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,050
Yeah.

1972
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:36,210
If he blocks, he blocks low.

1973
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,430
So, dry rush medium so you can throw him again.

1974
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:39,830
Or dry rush overhead.

1975
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:43,590
Got you.

1976
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,370
Oh.

1977
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:57,450
Nice defense.

1978
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:03,730
Oh.

1979
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:08,370
Nice.

1980
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:11,610
Nice.

1981
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:13,610
Nice jump out.

1982
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:14,110
Yes, sir.

1983
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,910
So, he's probably going to mash super.

1984
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:19,990
Yep.

1985
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,130
Oh, nice move.

1986
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:25,990
Oh, nice punish.

1987
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:27,150
Yes.

1988
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:27,630
Good jump.

1989
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,090
Oh, nice.

1990
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:31,150
There we go.

1991
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:31,510
Exactly.

1992
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:32,130
Exactly.

1993
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:32,750
Let's go.

1994
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:33,990
What a read on that coat.

1995
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:34,370
Yeah.

1996
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,060
Man, these matches are more intense than last...

1997
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,980
the first day.

1998
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,920
Yes, sir.

1999
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:45,740
You know the combos.

2000
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:46,160
We got the lead.

2001
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:47,980
Mixing.

2002
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:48,640
Mixing his ass.

2003
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,760
He's confused.

2004
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:50,700
Nice attack.

2005
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:51,200
Nice attack.

2006
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,320
Yes, sir.

2007
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,820
He's just on... Oh.

2008
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:55,320
That's fine.

2009
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,360
He's even messing up his mash.

2010
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:56,740
He's tilt.

2011
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,560
He's almost burnt, so don't worry about it.

2012
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:20,680
I didn't miss it.

2013
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:21,800
Yeah.

2014
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,200
Yeah.

2015
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:23,960
So close.

2016
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,440
That was such a wonky anti-air.

2017
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,800
That was such a wonky anti-air.

2018
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,860
It was all into the cross-up at the end.

2019
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:32,220
Yeah.

2020
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,120
It was just one interaction.

2021
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,940
Could have gone either way, I think.

2022
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:35,420
Yeah.

2023
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:35,960
Yeah.

2024
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:40,320
He was doing a bunch of random silly demon flip shenanigans.

2025
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:42,520
And Akuma's so awkward.

2026
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,040
You try to anti-air, but his dive kick stalls him.

2027
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,380
I hope they butcher this character.

2028
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,300
I'm not even gonna lie.

2029
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:49,140
I hope they fucking gut him.

2030
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,380
Capcom, you're watching this?

2031
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,820
His fireballs are so annoying.

2032
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,020
Next patch, nerfed Aki.

2033
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,400
Alright.

2034
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,420
God, I hope not.

2035
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,520
They just barely buffed.

2036
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,240
She was so bad.

2037
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,200
Alright, coach.

2038
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:04,180
Good luck.

2039
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:04,800
Good luck.

2040
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,040
You got this, coach.

2041
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,400
Oh, is Shine here, actually?

2042
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:12,560
Oh.

2043
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:13,280
Wait, what?

2044
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:14,160
Oh, yeah.

2045
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,200
Yeah.

2046
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:17,440
Yeah.

2047
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,740
Did he leave already?

2048
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:24,080
Well, he might be in his match for the other thing, so I guess we have to see.

2049
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,960
It says he's muted.

2050
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:26,760
He's here.

2051
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,440
DQ.

2052
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,300
DQ.

2053
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:30,900
DQ.

2054
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,000
DQ.

2055
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:31,320
DQ.

2056
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:31,800
DQ.

2057
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,360
DQ.

2058
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,660
If the teacher doesn't arrive in 15 minutes, then it's...

2059
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,460
We can legally leave the class.

2060
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,200
He's here.

2061
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:45,520
I don't know what he's doing.

2062
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:47,020
He got DQ'd on the last round.

2063
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:48,980
He is here, though.

2064
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,920
It's not like he's in the Capcom thing.

2065
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:55,740
Maybe he's just watching the other, like, watching the players from the other tournament.

2066
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,740
Oh, well, he's gotta get going here.

2067
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:04,420
I can't imagine him not coaching his master rank player.

2068
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,020
DQ.

2069
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:10,820
DQ.

2070
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:10,820
DQ.

2071
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:11,180
He's coming.

2072
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:12,940
Just kidding.

2073
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,100
Oh, okay.

2074
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,020
You just switched to Kim.

2075
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:18,620
Oh, okay.

2076
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:18,840
Okay.

2077
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,480
That's the way he played last time, though.

2078
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,520
I don't even remember.

2079
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,560
It was kind of close last time.

2080
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,700
It was very close, yeah.

2081
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:26,680
Okay, cool.

2082
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,000
Let's go.

2083
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,640
Alright, let's do this.

2084
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:29,660
Good luck, coach.

2085
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:30,760
Let's go.

2086
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:31,100
Let's go.

2087
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:31,400
Let's go.

2088
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:33,380
Oh,

2089
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:01,990
that's so cheap.

2090
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,440
Kimberly's just oppressive as hell.

2091
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:19,840
Kimberly's just oppressive as hell.

2092
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,780
Yeah, she's very offensive.

2093
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:25,600
I like Kimberly's default costume more than this one.

2094
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:25,960
I like Kimberly's default costume more than this one.

2095
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:27,280
I like Kimberly's default costume more than this one.

2096
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:27,680
Really?

2097
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,860
Yeah, I think your default costume's cute.

2098
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,900
I like the baggy pants one.

2099
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:33,660
My bad.

2100
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:34,140
My bad.

2101
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,540
Go, Brian.

2102
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:35,780
Go.

2103
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:37,680
Let's go, coach.

2104
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:54,070
That was a good break, man.

2105
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:01,510
Just straight up nooch.

2106
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:01,870
Just straight up nooch.

2107
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,150
Oh, that's a nice carry.

2108
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:10,030
Let's go to the other side, and they're burnt out soon.

2109
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,550
Let's go to the other side, and they're burnt out soon.

2110
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,270
Their end players never did this before.

2111
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:15,610
Oh, I think they're dead.

2112
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,270
He's dead.

2113
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:17,770
Yeah.

2114
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:20,830
Oh, nice!

2115
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:24,050
Oh, we're crossing into the Z-axis with this one, boys.

2116
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:24,410
Let's go.

2117
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,410
That was a Tekken 7 wall carry.

2118
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:27,530
Uh-oh.

2119
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,590
They kicked you out?

2120
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,090
Oh, they kicked me out?

2121
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:32,010
Oh, okay.

2122
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:32,390
Sorry.

2123
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:35,690
Because I had a conversation, so I got kicked out.

2124
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,530
Violated the code of conduct.

2125
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:41,850
It's okay.

2126
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:46,470
I swear we won't have conversations anymore.

2127
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,220
Oh, man.

2128
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,060
Oh, he baited the anti-air.

2129
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:04,640
Yeah.

2130
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:06,980
That's the hard part.

2131
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:15,180
Oh, for having Akuma and Kim just like those stop momentum type of air moves.

2132
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:15,740
I hate them.

2133
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:17,960
Oh, here we go.

2134
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,780
Oh, pressure time.

2135
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:22,240
And chip.

2136
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:22,900
Oh, nice!

2137
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,040
Oh, you can turn into Rashid like that.

2138
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:25,920
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2139
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:26,900
Hey, that's so cool.

2140
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:32,900
Oh, here we go.

2141
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:33,540
Oh, nice blocks.

2142
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,060
Nice interrupt!

2143
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,320
Let's go, coach!

2144
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,800
Oh, go, coach!

2145
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:42,920
Yes!

2146
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:45,300
Slam dunk.

2147
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,140
Let's fucking go!

2148
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:50,860
Hell, yeah.

2149
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:51,600
Look at that pretty boy.

2150
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,320
Oh, my God.

2151
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,780
That was so cool.

2152
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,220
Oh, man.

2153
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:56,780
Nice.

2154
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,200
One more, coach.

2155
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,140
One more just like that.

2156
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,060
Dude, he's so good.

2157
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:01,640
Did you guys see the last set, too?

2158
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,180
That was crazy.

2159
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:02,800
All right.

2160
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,320
No conversation.

2161
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:07,260
No conversation.

2162
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,420
No conversations or you get kicked out by the Capcoms.

2163
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,040
Here we go.

2164
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,700
That was a good call.

2165
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:13,020
Nice.

2166
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:13,540
Nice mash.

2167
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:22,620
Oh, nice.

2168
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:23,880
Okay, nice DP.

2169
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,620
Oh, out of the air, Amiga.

2170
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,000
Good block.

2171
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:30,700
Good block.

2172
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,180
That's one of the things with Kimberly.

2173
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,520
She can put you back in the corner.

2174
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,200
Here we go.

2175
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:43,480
Oh, nice.

2176
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:43,780
Oh, nice.

2177
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,120
Oh, nice counter.

2178
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,780
Back in the corner, Amiga.

2179
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,080
Back in the corner, you go.

2180
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,140
It's fucking go.

2181
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:51,740
No punish.

2182
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:52,360
Okay, nice.

2183
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,580
They're just throwing each other in the corner.

2184
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,020
Yeah.

2185
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,140
Let's go.

2186
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh, my God.

2187
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,260
And still.

2188
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:04,920
Oh.

2189
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,460
Should have taught your end players this.

2190
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,100
Here we go.

2191
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,500
Oh, the shimmy.

2192
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,240
Oh, my God.

2193
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:13,940
He's disgusting.

2194
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,120
He's disgusting.

2195
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:24,300
Nice blocks.

2196
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,580
Back in here.

2197
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:28,640
Get over here.

2198
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:29,800
Turn into Scorpion.

2199
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,080
Oh, the mash.

2200
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:35,560
God, he's so oppressive.

2201
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,560
Uh-oh.

2202
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,520
That was good.

2203
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,600
Yeah, he had to.

2204
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:41,480
He had to.

2205
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:42,680
He saw him.

2206
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:43,520
He saw him charging.

2207
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:44,160
He saw him charging.

2208
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,560
He was too tired of the corner.

2209
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,840
Oh, that was a good jump for me.

2210
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:50,260
Grambled eggs.

2211
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:53,440
Oh, that's so nasty.

2212
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,320
What the fuck?

2213
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:58,740
And to another blender mix-up.

2214
01:20:58,960 --> 01:20:59,740
Ay, ay, ay.

2215
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,560
Ay, ay, ay.

2216
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,080
Ay, ay, ay.

2217
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:04,820
Holy shit.

2218
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,100
What the fuck?

2219
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,600
I hate characters like this, dude.

2220
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,580
Why can't they do that?

2221
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,320
Blender characters, dude.

2222
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:11,100
Fine.

2223
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,980
I don't even know what just happened.

2224
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,000
Neutral happened, Doki.

2225
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:17,540
Neutral.

2226
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:19,920
That's also annoying.

2227
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,080
He baits out the anti-air.

2228
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:21,940
Yeah.

2229
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,060
Alright, it's not over.

2230
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:25,160
Still in there.

2231
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,380
She has her power-up, and that's the only thing.

2232
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,820
Oh, now he's counting.

2233
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,400
Yeah.

2234
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:46,600
Yeah.

2235
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,040
He baited.

2236
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,960
Good try.

2237
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:49,700
Nice try.

2238
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,160
Nice try.

2239
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:51,980
Nice try.

2240
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:54,140
We adapt.

2241
01:21:58,270 --> 01:21:58,750
Alright.

2242
01:21:59,190 --> 01:21:59,790
Here we go.

2243
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:01,050
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

2244
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:02,490
Easy.

2245
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:03,430
I believe.

2246
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:17,510
Woo!

2247
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:18,290
Conversion!

2248
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,470
Oh my god.

2249
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:20,510
Oh, that was crazy.

2250
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:26,820
Oh.

2251
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:27,880
Oh.

2252
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,580
The spacing, though, is crazy.

2253
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,120
Let's go!

2254
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,480
Watch your toes, amigo!

2255
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:51,340
Nice.

2256
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,580
A meter, though.

2257
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:55,560
Yeah.

2258
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,080
Take a easy.

2259
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,640
Rock, paper, scissors.

2260
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:02,980
Nice.

2261
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,820
Get back in the corner.

2262
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:04,000
Nice.

2263
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:14,480
Let's go!

2264
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,600
Get in there, coach!

2265
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:16,140
Let's go!

2266
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:17,600
Yeah!

2267
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:22,040
Oh, this is so intense.

2268
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:22,940
Yeah.

2269
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,100
Coach's match is so scary.

2270
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,000
I know.

2271
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,760
Yeah, I'm feeling it for him.

2272
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:43,270
Let's go!

2273
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:43,830
Nice!

2274
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,500
This is neutral.

2275
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,040
It's okay.

2276
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,480
Everybody's just...

2277
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:03,320
Oh, nice

2278
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,140
shot!

2279
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,400
That shot was insane!

2280
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:13,820
It's gonna be a lot of damage, but not death.

2281
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:16,040
Oh, that combo was sick.

2282
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:17,700
Oh, this fucking combo!

2283
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,300
Oh!

2284
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:18,840
Did you have one?

2285
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:19,680
For the fans!

2286
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:22,960
For the fans!

2287
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,760
Give me the damn points!

2288
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,500
Give me them points!

2289
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:28,320
That's right!

2290
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,240
Oh my god!

2291
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:31,920
Let's go.

2292
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,120
GG's.

2293
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,060
Dude, hold on.

2294
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,280
We gotta do this.

2295
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:41,540
We gotta... GG's.

2296
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:42,160
Oh!

2297
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:44,820
Hold on.

2298
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,540
I'm not done yet.

2299
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,000
Where are you?

2300
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:48,820
What are you typing?

2301
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,140
GG's smile.

2302
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:54,200
Let's go, baby!

2303
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:55,320
Oh my god.

2304
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,440
You guys gotta understand.

2305
01:24:56,780 --> 01:25:00,440
Shine has been like my tournament demon for like seven years.

2306
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,360
Oh, has he?

2307
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,320
Seven years?

2308
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,640
I have maybe like three set wins out of like 30.

2309
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:08,220
Oh!

2310
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:09,040
Wow!

2311
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,780
We got four now, man!

2312
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,740
We have to end up with a four!

2313
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,060
Oh my god.

2314
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:14,820
Let's go.

2315
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,940
That's insane.

2316
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,360
Dude, that's...

2317
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,760
The neutral jump into the overhead punch and then the jump into the low.

2318
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,860
No, empty jump low was...

2319
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:26,820
That was the icing on top, dude.

2320
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:27,360
That was sick.

2321
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,780
4-26, baby!

2322
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,100
We're 4-26!

2323
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:31,880
We're cooking.

2324
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,660
He's gonna think about that in his tournament now.

2325
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,140
I feel bad.

2326
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:37,860
Shine's my boy.

2327
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:38,860
We're good friends.

2328
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,820
I don't gotta blame him for Cap'Em Cup.

2329
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:43,440
I don't gotta blame him for Cap'Em Cup.

2330
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,900
I want him to cook there, just not here.

2331
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,800
That's fucking tough.

2332
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:54,120
We actually don't have a break because Lillipichu's internet exploded, so we're doing this one next.

2333
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,260
We're going next.

2334
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,980
Oh, okay.

2335
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:57,920
So we're saving Lill...

2336
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,060
So Doki's match, we're saving from last.

2337
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,140
Oh, okay.

2338
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:01,760
What's going on?

2339
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,040
No, look at stage three.

2340
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,080
They just tagged us.

2341
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,680
Group B first.

2342
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,220
We're towards the end.

2343
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,940
For Lillipichu's internet exploded.

2344
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,020
So we're going to do Group B.

2345
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,440
So I don't have to play yet.

2346
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,260
Doki will play later.

2347
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:21,220
Me and you need to test something real quick.

2348
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,400
Me and you need to test something real quick.

2349
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,220
Do they have trainee spots open in there?

2350
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,800
I don't think they...

2351
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:28,560
Did they send out the invites?

2352
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:29,960
I'm checking.

2353
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:33,760
I only have Slam Man, which is the...

2354
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,900
I got an invite from Claire.

2355
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:35,500
Okay.

2356
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:39,060
Okay, so Doki, meet me in the training thing real quick.

2357
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,480
Okay.

2358
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,140
Meet me in the field.

2359
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,060
I only have Slam Man's invite.

2360
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,280
Oh, for my game, I have a request.

2361
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:47,660
Oh?

2362
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:54,580
Everyone can talk and all this is good, but for coaching, I only want to know if I'm like getting scammed by something.

2363
01:26:54,780 --> 01:27:04,860
Like if I'm not punishing a move that is punishable, or if like when Skar was fighting me, he was doing two heavy punches into the grab, but you can just jump it, and I thought it was guaranteed.

2364
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,140
Like that kind of thing.

2365
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,900
Okay, I'll shut up.

2366
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:09,120
No, no.

2367
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:10,800
No, that's good.

2368
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,700
Tell me to shut up, especially if I don't shut up and I need me to shut up.

2369
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,460
Please tell me to shut up.

2370
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,280
I totally understand.

2371
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,860
I'm in the...

2372
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:24,940
It's just like extra mental attack when there's like backseat and I think about what I want to do.

2373
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,260
I'll make sure to be quiet.

2374
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:28,380
Which one is this one?

2375
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,520
This is team who?

2376
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:30,520
Oh, Nephew.

2377
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,840
But I'll also ask SK, please then don't hit rematch.

2378
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:34,900
Okay.

2379
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,740
For everybody, we don't have to hit rematch.

2380
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,500
You can go back to lobby.

2381
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,480
I will not do that.

2382
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:44,780
I can fake Chun-Li swap too, to get in their heads.

2383
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:50,440
Yeah, because if there's something obvious that can help you, we need a little bit of time to just say it, right?

2384
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,220
Okay, got it.

2385
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,400
Alright.

2386
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:58,130
I'm in training room four.

2387
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:00,670
Okay, I'm heading over there.

2388
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,700
I got shopper backseating, true.

2389
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:10,820
Shopper backseating.

2390
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,100
Yeah.

2391
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,680
Yeah, I got banned.

2392
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:21,420
Okay, so the move you gotta look out for, Doki, is this move.

2393
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,120
Yeah.

2394
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,380
So this is what gives her the soar.

2395
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:31,760
So in the top right by my name, it shows a number, and then every time I do this move, it burns one of those resources.

2396
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,860
The thing is, this is plus.

2397
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:34,560
Okay.

2398
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,020
So if she's able to back up, she wants to do this and build up.

2399
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:44,280
So in the beginning, you can rush her down and do DI, like get closer in the beginning so that she doesn't build this up.

2400
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:48,760
Yeah, but once she has this, what's gonna happen is this is gonna come out out of nowhere.

2401
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:49,220
Yeah.

2402
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,700
So when you block this, how does she do command grab?

2403
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,240
Let me see, hold on a second.

2404
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,560
Yeah, she can do a command grab after that spinny spin.

2405
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,380
I can't grab it back.

2406
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,700
I want us to start.

2407
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:03,220
I'm scared.

2408
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,800
No, just play your game.

2409
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:06,120
It's okay.

2410
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,740
You got it, SK.

2411
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,940
Should I wait for your training thing or do I just go?

2412
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:11,720
I can go.

2413
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,320
Wait one second.

2414
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:14,840
We'll stop for one second.

2415
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:18,080
So yeah, if you block this, just jump.

2416
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:23,120
If you block the one that's enhanced with wind, because I'm gonna try to do a command grab after.

2417
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:23,320
Okay.

2418
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:28,460
Yeah, so if you block the fancy one, block, jump I mean, sorry.

2419
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:32,000
Now if you block, when she doesn't have one, it's gonna look way less cool.

2420
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:33,740
Yeah.

2421
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,680
That one you can press your squares or whatever.

2422
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,400
Or a triangle, whatever.

2423
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:39,660
These are not very good.

2424
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:47,200
But the one where it's super, all the wind and everything, she's gonna back up and do this and just fly at you, you need to jump after.

2425
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,040
She's gonna try to grab you after.

2426
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:49,780
Alright.

2427
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,900
We leave.

2428
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,420
I'm going.

2429
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,280
We watch now.

2430
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,840
We'll watch and cheer calmly.

2431
01:29:59,120 --> 01:29:59,560
Yeah!

2432
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:01,180
Okay.

2433
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:05,640
Manon.

2434
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2435
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,300
Manon, Manon.

2436
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:09,980
You got it.

2437
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,700
You lab for this.

2438
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,240
Manon.

2439
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,780
Is she French?

2440
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:17,380
Yes.

2441
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,700
Yeah, Scar only plays French characters.

2442
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:20,180
Yeah.

2443
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:21,500
He's so French.

2444
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,860
Yeah, that's true.

2445
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:25,820
Yeah, dude.

2446
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,440
Let's go.

2447
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:28,460
Let's go.

2448
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:40,130
Ouch.

2449
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:41,830
Okay, I need to jump so much more.

2450
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:43,890
Nice.

2451
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,360
I'm just gonna hold up.

2452
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:53,460
Yeah?

2453
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:54,940
Mhm.

2454
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:57,020
And just get a big punish when she whips.

2455
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:00,500
Nice.

2456
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:00,940
Nice.

2457
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,200
Nice.

2458
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:05,880
Beautiful.

2459
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:08,240
That's alright.

2460
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:17,650
There you go.

2461
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:18,130
Got him.

2462
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:19,310
Nice.

2463
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:20,290
Alright.

2464
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:20,790
Very nice.

2465
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:21,550
Oh, rush him down.

2466
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:24,390
Burn him out.

2467
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:24,810
Nice!

2468
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:25,890
He's burnt.

2469
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:26,270
Let's go.

2470
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:28,310
Get him!

2471
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:30,710
Let's go!

2472
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:31,830
Very clean.

2473
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:32,370
Let's go!

2474
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:45,930
Take that, Scarra.

2475
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:48,470
Oh, yeah.

2476
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:49,950
Dude, get a little toxic with it.

2477
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:50,510
I love it.

2478
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:51,810
Yeah!

2479
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:54,390
He doesn't know what to do when you're in the air.

2480
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:56,550
Woo!

2481
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,370
Oh, what a grab!

2482
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:00,590
What the fuck?

2483
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:01,430
Reset his ass.

2484
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:03,350
Let's go.

2485
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:04,010
Nice.

2486
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:07,110
Oh, my god.

2487
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:09,070
Just rush him down.

2488
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:09,910
Let's go, SK.

2489
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:10,730
That's insane!

2490
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:11,750
Let's go.

2491
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:12,310
Play your game.

2492
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,470
Let's go.

2493
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:15,590
Go.

2494
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:19,650
What a game.

2495
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:22,330
My dog is getting excited, too.

2496
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:22,650
Oh, no.

2497
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:24,090
My dog's getting hyped.

2498
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:25,310
Oh, it must be a good match, then.

2499
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,390
He's enjoying it.

2500
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:35,450
Oh, he's getting jump-happy now.

2501
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:36,810
Oh, I'm old.

2502
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:37,810
That's alright.

2503
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:38,950
Alright, he's older.

2504
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:40,190
I'm old.

2505
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:41,990
Skarra's, like, 49.

2506
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:42,490
Yeah!

2507
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:43,610
What?

2508
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:48,890
So, he just always command grabs there, SK.

2509
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:49,530
Okay.

2510
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:52,350
So, too heavy punch, if you get just pulled up, straight up.

2511
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:52,730
Okay.

2512
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:54,750
He always command grabs there every single time.

2513
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:57,350
And then you can do those splits as you land, those heavy kicks.

2514
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,280
Nice anti-air!

2515
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:03,620
God damn!

2516
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:06,720
Nice!

2517
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:07,400
Let's go!

2518
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:08,820
Holy shit, look at you go!

2519
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:17,800
Oh, I was holding...

2520
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,160
I was holding jump there.

2521
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:18,860
Was that one real?

2522
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:19,940
That's a combo, yeah.

2523
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,220
Okay, okay.

2524
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,200
Nice!

2525
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,520
Burn her out!

2526
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:30,740
Nice.

2527
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:32,460
Let's go!

2528
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:33,060
Burn her out!

2529
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:38,130
That's okay, block her!

2530
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:38,690
Oh, nice jump!

2531
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:42,170
That's a grab.

2532
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:43,670
Oh, okay.

2533
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:45,990
Just chill.

2534
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:46,970
What do I do to get out of this?

2535
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:50,630
Yeah, you have to... the only way out of that...

2536
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:51,590
You could have leveled three.

2537
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:52,470
Yeah.

2538
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:54,590
Level three or level one.

2539
01:33:55,150 --> 01:33:57,770
Spamming that, you have to do super, and you have to do it right away.

2540
01:33:58,010 --> 01:33:58,910
So it's very tough.

2541
01:33:58,990 --> 01:33:59,290
Yeah.

2542
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:01,130
So just try to not burn yourself out.

2543
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:05,490
Okay, I see you.

2544
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:17,750
Okay, he's doing the hits instead of command grabbing you right now.

2545
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:19,830
There you go.

2546
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:20,050
Yeah.

2547
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:25,800
Nice!

2548
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:28,300
Nice!

2549
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:28,860
Nice!

2550
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:29,140
Nice!

2551
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:31,980
Nice combo!

2552
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,160
Oh, almost had it.

2553
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:34,800
Good idea, good idea.

2554
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,140
Nice jump out.

2555
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:38,460
Holy shit, that was insane!

2556
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,840
One more time.

2557
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:42,740
Woo!

2558
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,220
Oh my god!

2559
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:46,660
You're so sick with it!

2560
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,040
You're so sick with it, SK!

2561
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:50,900
I can't believe this.

2562
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:51,460
He's mortal!

2563
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:52,060
He's insane!

2564
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:53,580
Very clean.

2565
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,540
Make him bleed!

2566
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:09,360
Oh, where's my health?

2567
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,600
That's called grabbing.

2568
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,240
Remember, he always command grabs there.

2569
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,360
You can just DP also.

2570
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:17,180
That beats everything.

2571
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,080
He does two slaps and he presses something.

2572
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:20,320
Just always DP there.

2573
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,780
He never blocks there.

2574
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:22,800
He's always doing something.

2575
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:24,520
Let's do this.

2576
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:27,980
Woo!

2577
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:28,980
That was clean!

2578
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:29,420
That was good.

2579
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,200
Oh.

2580
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,820
What the fuck?

2581
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:43,350
Oh nice!

2582
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:43,710
Nice!

2583
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:50,350
Oh, I missed him with my super.

2584
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:52,810
Fine.

2585
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:53,470
No!

2586
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:54,770
Oh, sorry.

2587
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:55,610
It was close.

2588
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:57,070
It was a close match.

2589
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:58,070
He had that level three.

2590
01:35:58,270 --> 01:35:59,390
Oh, that would have turned it around.

2591
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:00,590
That was a good try though.

2592
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:01,870
Good try.

2593
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:02,170
Good try.

2594
01:36:02,610 --> 01:36:03,810
You had a good game plan.

2595
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:08,870
It's just like when you went in with the drive rush, you would press the medium too early.

2596
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:10,750
Like it's just, you know, experience.

2597
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:14,870
You whiff the medium and then the second medium would come out and he would hit you or DI you.

2598
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:16,290
Oh, okay.

2599
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:20,450
I was trying to press it earlier because he was like hitting me out of it.

2600
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:21,830
Dude, SK.

2601
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:23,590
Sunday, you're going to be a beast.

2602
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:24,510
Yeah, yeah.

2603
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:29,190
You're going to give them a false sense of security and you're going to beat the shit out of them.

2604
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:30,150
That's right.

2605
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:30,550
Yeah.

2606
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:35,930
Yeah, your strategy is better.

2607
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:38,290
It's just tightening up the timing.

2608
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:42,490
I see this.

2609
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:44,910
Go, go, go!

2610
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:47,290
Hey, hey!

2611
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:54,670
Oh, nice grab!

2612
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:58,170
Holy shit, his HP's gone.

2613
01:36:59,050 --> 01:36:59,850
Yeah, right?

2614
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:01,690
It's gone.

2615
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:02,490
Dissipated.

2616
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:03,390
That was fast.

2617
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:05,050
It took like five seconds.

2618
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:06,090
Oh my gosh.

2619
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:07,470
Let's go.

2620
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:14,140
Ooh, I like that.

2621
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:15,120
Oh.

2622
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:19,320
I thought you were not fast, dude.

2623
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:20,000
That's fine.

2624
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,040
Has he got these?

2625
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:24,440
Interesting combo, yeah.

2626
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:26,100
Oh, he don't have the rhythm.

2627
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,200
Nah, he don't got this.

2628
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:30,180
That's hard, too, to be honest.

2629
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:32,780
Nice.

2630
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,020
Ooh, that was unlucky.

2631
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:41,020
It's all good.

2632
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,200
You can turn this around.

2633
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:45,500
Yeah.

2634
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,080
He'll be so sick, too.

2635
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:50,280
Oh, he's so scared.

2636
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,780
That was unlucky with Elaria.

2637
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:53,940
Yeah, that was unlucky.

2638
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:57,240
Just don't worry about it.

2639
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:58,200
He's trying to walk away from you.

2640
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:58,540
Yeah.

2641
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:02,600
So just, you know, jump towards him and use your jump medium kick and stuff like that.

2642
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:08,660
See?

2643
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:09,440
Yeah.

2644
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:10,340
Yeah.

2645
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:12,480
Yeah.

2646
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:15,280
Yeah.

2647
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:16,300
Yeah.

2648
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:16,960
Yeah.

2649
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:17,240
Yeah.

2650
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,260
Yeah.

2651
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:19,740
Yeah.

2652
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,500
I don't know if he's going to jump but the ball is going to be on his head anyway.

2653
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,240
Oh, that was a good one.

2654
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:27,840
Yeah.

2655
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:33,340
Nice.

2656
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:33,660
Oh, nice.

2657
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:33,960
You're in.

2658
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:35,180
You're inside.

2659
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,240
You're in his head.

2660
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:39,460
Oh!

2661
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:40,100
Nice grab!

2662
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:40,860
Here we go.

2663
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:46,350
Oh, come on.

2664
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:47,630
That prediction is crazy.

2665
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:48,810
That's right, he tried, he tried, he tried.

2666
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:51,270
Oh my gosh!

2667
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:53,150
One more, he might super...

2668
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:53,730
Yeah.

2669
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,670
Ooh, I like it.

2670
01:38:58,070 --> 01:38:58,610
Woo!

2671
01:38:59,170 --> 01:38:59,710
Nice!

2672
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:02,090
He's from the tip!

2673
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:04,310
Let's go.

2674
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:06,150
Nice!

2675
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:08,210
Woo!

2676
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:13,790
I can't believe he had time.

2677
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:16,890
So that's a super fast sweep.

2678
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:18,610
He has a unique sweep.

2679
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:19,810
But you can't punish it.

2680
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:27,650
Oh yeah!

2681
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,760
Oh nice punish, he knows about it.

2682
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,120
Yeah, just...

2683
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,020
Don't need the gimmicks.

2684
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:40,680
Yeah, just secure the win.

2685
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:49,790
Yeah, just secure the win.

2686
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:50,390
Ooh, BJ's fun.

2687
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:51,410
Hey, hey, hey.

2688
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:53,550
Okay.

2689
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:56,210
No worries, no worries.

2690
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,180
Oh, nice!

2691
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,760
Oh, so close!

2692
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:08,900
Just need a little pixel.

2693
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,220
That was good.

2694
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,680
Nice parry though.

2695
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,460
Damn it.

2696
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:15,660
Fine, I'll stop DIing.

2697
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,380
Yeah.

2698
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:20,040
You can DI, but not like, defensively up close.

2699
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,100
Like, you're gonna DI from further away.

2700
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:22,780
Mhm.

2701
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:26,260
He's gonna be trying to press bigger buttons, not up close.

2702
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:27,920
Got it.

2703
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:29,480
Do you have level 3?

2704
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,560
You got level 3, just in case things fail.

2705
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,160
Yeah, beat him.

2706
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:36,700
You got level 2 also.

2707
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:41,260
Nice.

2708
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:41,760
Nice.

2709
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:43,520
Yep, good patience.

2710
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,220
Oh, nice!

2711
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:46,780
Nice.

2712
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:49,140
He's cornered.

2713
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:53,980
Well, that's too far.

2714
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:54,940
Is it?

2715
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,540
That was close.

2716
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:58,460
Alright, you got one more game.

2717
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:01,720
Yeah, the knee stuff is not gonna work on him at all.

2718
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:04,120
He's always out of that range.

2719
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:05,660
He's always walking away, always jumping.

2720
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:09,080
Don't work on people who are constantly out of your range.

2721
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,020
Okay.

2722
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:24,870
There you go.

2723
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:25,370
Nice!

2724
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:27,290
Let's get in there.

2725
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:30,730
Oh, he's disoriented!

2726
01:41:39,690 --> 01:41:43,610
That was close.

2727
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:52,450
Nice!

2728
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:52,790
Nice!

2729
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:56,290
Nice!

2730
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:58,210
Oh, nice combo!

2731
01:41:59,030 --> 01:41:59,710
Nice!

2732
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:00,990
Let's go, baby!

2733
01:42:01,070 --> 01:42:02,370
The call-out, dude!

2734
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,070
The call-out.

2735
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:06,690
Nice!

2736
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:22,310
That's good.

2737
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:24,250
Oh yeah, I can make him pay.

2738
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:26,050
That's a good punish.

2739
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:26,350
That's a good finish.

2740
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:30,010
Uh-oh.

2741
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:31,650
I see the vision.

2742
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:35,390
Okay.

2743
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,720
Yeah, just conserve your meter.

2744
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:42,720
Yeah, good play.

2745
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,940
Come on!

2746
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:44,600
Baby!

2747
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,120
Yeah!

2748
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,240
Come on!

2749
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:52,000
Yeah!

2750
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:54,920
Oh my god!

2751
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,000
You're disgusting, bro!

2752
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,660
You're disgusting, brother!

2753
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,420
My loyal fans!

2754
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:00,840
My loyal fans!

2755
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:02,260
Let's go!

2756
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:04,780
You just traumatized them.

2757
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:07,180
Good patience, dude.

2758
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:08,240
That was incredible.

2759
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:09,180
That was sick!

2760
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,340
That's legit what you do.

2761
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:16,080
If there's dry brush cancels, you buffer level 3 like that.

2762
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:16,980
That's the thing to do.

2763
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:17,720
What's level 3?

2764
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:18,920
Is it 720 in this game still?

2765
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:19,740
Yes.

2766
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:21,340
Oh, you turned that shit hard.

2767
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:23,120
That was crazy fast.

2768
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,180
Let's go, dude.

2769
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:29,260
See, I'm so good with the tournament pressure, bro.

2770
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:30,200
Period.

2771
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:31,640
End it there, bro.

2772
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,760
I'm so good.

2773
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,500
You're just so used to it.

2774
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:35,740
Let's go.

2775
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:39,000
Alright, let's see this.

2776
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:41,860
Alrighty.

2777
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,720
It's so nerve-wracking, though.

2778
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,080
It really is.

2779
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:49,160
You're chasing a feeling.

2780
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,040
You can win.

2781
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:51,300
I believe, I believe.

2782
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,540
Who is he playing now?

2783
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:54,560
Huntress.

2784
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,840
Huntress is in training right now.

2785
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,360
I got notes.

2786
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:01,360
Let's see.

2787
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:10,180
Dude, I just realized I think Zangief is the most Tekken character in his entire roster.

2788
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:11,280
Yeah.

2789
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:17,640
He's the only one that has to dry brush to gain space just like a Tekken game.

2790
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,540
And his damage is insane, too.

2791
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,160
From just, like, four hits.

2792
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:26,080
Yeah, but you have to find them, though.

2793
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:26,420
Yeah.

2794
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:32,040
What is Huntress Tekken right now?

2795
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:33,960
Another DQ.

2796
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:34,400
Let's go.

2797
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:36,080
She wants coin flip.

2798
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:39,020
I can just give it up.

2799
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,700
I don't care, really.

2800
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:43,240
Damn, you can do either side?

2801
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:44,680
Oh, yeah.

2802
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:45,800
That's cheating.

2803
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:51,060
You should probably coin flip just so she can get to player two, though.

2804
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:52,440
Oh, no, you should.

2805
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:53,480
Yeah, you should have.

2806
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:55,560
On Sunday, we should do that.

2807
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,160
On Sunday, we should do that, for sure.

2808
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:58,980
It really does not matter.

2809
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:03,060
At least we have to be the heel.

2810
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,320
We did the training.

2811
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:06,400
It doesn't matter.

2812
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:07,920
We don't need any bullshit advantages.

2813
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:10,700
No, but we're the heel of the tournament.

2814
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:14,340
There's nothing more heel than just being fucking better.

2815
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,980
But it's like just salt on the wound.

2816
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,600
You gotta win first to do that.

2817
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,100
Let's get the W.

2818
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:35,010
Oh, what?

2819
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:38,010
Nice jump out.

2820
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:38,350
Nice.

2821
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:39,330
Let's go, man.

2822
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:43,670
Yeah, at first knockout, she always does that.

2823
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:44,230
She draws it, though.

2824
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:46,110
You're good.

2825
01:45:46,190 --> 01:45:46,390
You're good.

2826
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:55,540
Oh, nice.

2827
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:03,470
Oh, nice.

2828
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:04,950
She's buffering super, so don't throw a fireball.

2829
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:05,350
She's buffering super, so don't throw a fireball.

2830
01:46:07,330 --> 01:46:08,350
What the fuck?

2831
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:08,990
Nice.

2832
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:10,670
Yeah, just don't throw a fireball.

2833
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:12,390
Just fucking goomba stomp.

2834
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:13,830
Nice.

2835
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:15,430
Oh, nice!

2836
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:15,810
Nice!

2837
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:16,070
Yeah!

2838
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:18,290
That shit's insane!

2839
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:19,170
Let's go.

2840
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:36,210
Nice defense.

2841
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:37,430
That's totally fine.

2842
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:38,450
She's so low on meter now.

2843
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:41,930
Nice.

2844
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:42,690
Yes, sir.

2845
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:44,690
Yes, sir.

2846
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:45,750
Oh, another grab!

2847
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:50,610
Yeah.

2848
01:46:51,450 --> 01:46:52,250
Holy shit!

2849
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:54,750
Nice.

2850
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:55,950
Oh, beautiful.

2851
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:56,710
She's at level three.

2852
01:46:58,130 --> 01:46:59,190
Oh, shit, yeah.

2853
01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:00,910
You forced her to burn it.

2854
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:03,130
And now you have your super in case she does DI.

2855
01:47:11,330 --> 01:47:13,570
Yeah, she has no super, so you can throw fireballs.

2856
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:15,130
Don't worry about this, aren't you?

2857
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:20,810
Yeah, that's fine.

2858
01:47:21,010 --> 01:47:21,110
That's fine.

2859
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:22,090
Don't wanna go.

2860
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:35,080
Nice.

2861
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:35,860
Oh, beautiful.

2862
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:36,820
Oh, nice grab!

2863
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:40,620
Mine!

2864
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:42,260
Level three.

2865
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:45,740
Yeah, poison her!

2866
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:50,020
Oh my god.

2867
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,920
She fed it all on that.

2868
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:54,940
Yeah, what a gamble.

2869
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:56,300
Fine.

2870
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,660
Oh, what the fuck was that?

2871
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,440
Oh, wow.

2872
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:08,280
Oh, nice grab!

2873
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:10,160
Just be careful about her level two.

2874
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:10,980
Nice!

2875
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:13,320
Let's go!

2876
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:18,280
One thing, just remember, drive rush medium punch after throws, too.

2877
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,560
They're all blocking down back or overhead.

2878
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:24,280
And if you do drive rush medium punch, you can easily get another throw without walking and all that.

2879
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:27,680
So it's the only thing that can tighten up your pressure a little bit.

2880
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:28,700
Oh, team of grapplers.

2881
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,980
Yeah, and that goes straight into the coward crouch after that.

2882
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:01,140
Nice challenge.

2883
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:03,740
Oh!

2884
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,480
A little pokey poke.

2885
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:07,400
Yeah!

2886
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:09,800
Nice!

2887
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,280
Today is so...

2888
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,440
It's so intense.

2889
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,280
Hey, conserve your meter after this.

2890
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,200
Yeah, just don't drive rush for a little while.

2891
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,220
What the fuck?

2892
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:27,560
Oh, wow.

2893
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:28,540
Oh my god!

2894
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:30,180
Oh!

2895
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:30,700
Nice!

2896
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:32,140
You're back!

2897
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:33,440
Oh!

2898
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,300
What the fuck!

2899
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:36,120
What are you doing?

2900
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:36,940
I knew it!

2901
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:37,640
I knew it!

2902
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:39,420
I knew it had something in my heart, dude!

2903
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:39,700
Let's go!

2904
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:42,660
You are crazy!

2905
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:44,040
I don't even know what happened!

2906
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:45,900
You are crazy!

2907
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,000
This guy...

2908
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,200
I can't believe it.

2909
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,100
It just looked sick, though!

2910
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:56,380
I...

2911
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:57,240
Dude.

2912
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,140
Oh, she has can-cans.

2913
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:05,680
Nice.

2914
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:06,900
Getting cheeky with it.

2915
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:07,680
She's flustered.

2916
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:09,580
Oh my god.

2917
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:10,140
You're in her head!

2918
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:10,780
You're in her head!

2919
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:11,600
Ko, you're in her head!

2920
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:12,640
Oh my god.

2921
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:13,540
Oh!

2922
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:16,880
It's the throw loop!

2923
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:18,060
Let's go!

2924
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:19,720
I can't believe you!

2925
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:22,380
Oh my god.

2926
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:23,080
Let's go, baby!

2927
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,400
You throw looped a master plan!

2928
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:27,480
That's fucking insane!

2929
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:29,840
That's actually so toxic.

2930
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:32,380
Oh my... That's so toxic.

2931
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:34,220
I'm team grappler, dude.

2932
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:35,320
I got brawl pro and doki.

2933
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:37,240
I got a grapple, dude.

2934
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,740
That's what I'm saying, dude.

2935
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:39,700
Get grappled!

2936
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,180
Get grappled!

2937
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:45,380
Get grappled!

2938
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:46,360
You are crazy.

2939
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:46,780
Get grappled!

2940
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:52,380
I should've converted that counter hit like forward heavy kick, but...

2941
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:52,840
I'll be right back.

2942
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:53,760
Damn.

2943
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,600
You mind broke her.

2944
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:59,160
That shit's gonna haunt her.

2945
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:05,300
That shit's gonna haunt her.

2946
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:06,580
She's so good.

2947
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:08,700
I've been dreading that matchup so much.

2948
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:09,400
She's so good.

2949
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:09,400
I've been dreading that matchup so much.

2950
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,340
I'm like, ah shit.

2951
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:14,240
Because I raided her and she's like analyzing my matches.

2952
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:14,360
Because I raided her and she's like analyzing my matches.

2953
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:15,220
I'm like, oh shit.

2954
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:18,000
That's fucked.

2955
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:22,180
I was definitely afraid of her matchups.

2956
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:22,300
I was definitely afraid of her matchups.

2957
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:23,140
That's intense, yeah.

2958
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:26,620
Alright, so is Lily ready?

2959
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:28,960
Am I playing Lily or is it coach match?

2960
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:31,700
I think she's still downloading.

2961
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:33,500
I think she's still downloading.

2962
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:34,300
I think she's still downloading.

2963
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:35,740
Wait, downloading what?

2964
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:37,660
I think she had to reinstall or something.

2965
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,980
I think.

2966
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:40,840
Okay.

2967
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:45,520
Dude, the less points we can give Team Nephew, the better.

2968
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:45,840
Alright?

2969
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:49,400
I mean, we actually are catching up to Team Nephew.

2970
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:51,200
Huh?

2971
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,880
We're catching up to Nephew's team.

2972
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:53,980
Are we?

2973
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:56,560
We're currently tied with Shine's team.

2974
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:00,300
We both have 79 points and Nephew has 89 points.

2975
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:01,320
We both have 79 points and Nephew has 89 points.

2976
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:02,200
Oh wow, wow.

2977
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:02,420
Yeah.

2978
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:03,260
So we're catching up.

2979
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:03,480
Oh wow, wow.

2980
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:03,480
Yeah.

2981
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:03,480
So we're catching up.

2982
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:03,800
Yeah.

2983
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:04,200
Nice.

2984
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,980
But Shine's team played more games.

2985
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:08,700
Oh, okay.

2986
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:09,040
Sweet.

2987
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:09,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2988
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:13,060
Let's see here.

2989
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:15,200
Yeah, no.

2990
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:19,220
I don't know why, but I had this weird feeling that she was going to super there.

2991
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:21,300
Bro, but even...

2992
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:23,020
That was sick though.

2993
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:24,680
But still, the grabs.

2994
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:26,680
That was so funny.

2995
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,680
And the thing is, she doesn't even have a good throw loop.

2996
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:32,740
Her throw loop is not as easy as like Jury's or...

2997
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:34,000
Oh, any other character.

2998
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:35,460
Yeah, yeah.

2999
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:42,560
Dude, apparently I hit my zone minutes on my Fitbit.

3000
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,040
Let's go.

3001
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:46,920
Let's go.

3002
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,920
That's enough exercising for the year.

3003
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:52,680
Yeah, my watch is like, hey, slow down, dude.

3004
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,820
I just started her Joker arc.

3005
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,640
I didn't mean to start her Joker arc.

3006
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,920
I just want to play video games.

3007
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,380
Now she's only going to train for you.

3008
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:09,280
Oh, there's an outage in her area.

3009
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:11,580
Oh, so she has to download...

3010
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:13,340
She has to go somewhere else to download.

3011
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:14,460
Possibly, yeah.

3012
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:15,740
I'm pretty sure.

3013
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:17,380
Or DQ.

3014
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:20,520
I'm going in, guys.

3015
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:22,160
Alright, get in there, brother.

3016
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:25,520
This is going to be probably the hardest match of the day, so let's do this.

3017
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,500
Ain't no pressure.

3018
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:27,460
You got this, amigo.

3019
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:27,880
Oops.

3020
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:32,770
SK's trying to fight.

3021
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:34,950
She's trying to throw hands.

3022
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:36,230
He's like, me next, me next.

3023
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:40,770
That match with Skara left her hungry.

3024
01:53:41,190 --> 01:53:41,990
Oh, yes.

3025
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:44,630
That was definitely winnable, yeah.

3026
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:46,430
He just did the command throw.

3027
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:49,630
All of your matches that you've lost are 100% winnable.

3028
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:50,330
Just one more.

3029
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:51,930
Couple more days of training.

3030
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:52,570
Oh my god.

3031
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:53,270
You're going to be nasty.

3032
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:55,070
Alright, coach has to lock in.

3033
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:56,150
Alright, lock in, coach.

3034
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:58,750
No conversations, I guess.

3035
01:53:59,710 --> 01:54:01,390
I'm going to use the backdoor.

3036
01:54:06,290 --> 01:54:06,650
Nice.

3037
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:28,190
Yeah, that was good.

3038
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:30,310
Nice try, nice try.

3039
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:44,720
Perfect parry.

3040
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:45,220
Get him.

3041
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:48,140
Oh, and the optimal punish for meter damage.

3042
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,500
Oh my god.

3043
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:54,760
Oh, yeah.

3044
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,460
Nice anti-air.

3045
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,020
Woo, and throw up that.

3046
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:08,280
Nice.

3047
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:12,720
Nice.

3048
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:20,600
Does it kill?

3049
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:21,840
Yes.

3050
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,200
No, yeah, that's definitely going to kill.

3051
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:26,580
Alright.

3052
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,540
Neph, he is very...

3053
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:32,200
He does the offensive stuff very often.

3054
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:33,540
Like he'll jump frequently.

3055
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:35,600
He's at the right time.

3056
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:38,780
He's also super optimal in every situation.

3057
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:42,880
Yeah, like right here.

3058
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:46,080
Nice DP, get him off.

3059
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,200
Woo, that's the toes.

3060
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:52,460
Woo.

3061
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,240
Nice block.

3062
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:55,660
Oh, Superman punch.

3063
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:57,100
That was sick.

3064
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,800
I like that.

3065
01:55:58,820 --> 01:55:59,740
That's some jury only tech.

3066
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:00,180
I like that.

3067
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:01,360
Yeah.

3068
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:08,460
Blitz.

3069
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:09,680
Oh.

3070
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:11,680
He was mashing that shit down.

3071
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:13,040
God damn.

3072
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:16,700
Oh, what the fuck?

3073
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:18,960
He almost had him.

3074
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:19,700
Oh, yeah.

3075
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:20,580
I didn't even know what that was.

3076
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:24,600
Yes.

3077
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:24,880
Yes.

3078
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:25,320
Oh, nice.

3079
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:26,780
Let's go.

3080
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:27,940
Let's fucking go.

3081
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:35,980
Eat it.

3082
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,420
Oh, my God.

3083
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:39,480
Big punish.

3084
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,340
To the corner we go.

3085
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,040
Oh.

3086
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,360
Oh.

3087
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:45,500
Oh.

3088
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:48,460
Oh, my God.

3089
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:49,060
It was on purpose.

3090
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:50,100
American reset.

3091
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:51,460
Oh, my God.

3092
01:56:57,950 --> 01:56:59,470
Oh, Superman punch.

3093
01:57:00,330 --> 01:57:01,190
Let's go, Bryan.

3094
01:57:06,410 --> 01:57:07,470
Oh, Superman.

3095
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:09,530
Let's fucking go.

3096
01:57:10,450 --> 01:57:13,070
Dude, we're calling shit out today.

3097
01:57:13,210 --> 01:57:13,690
Let's go.

3098
01:57:15,150 --> 01:57:15,710
Woo.

3099
01:57:16,010 --> 01:57:16,990
One more, coach.

3100
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:21,590
I wish this was Sunday.

3101
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:22,770
Yeah, I wish this was the finals.

3102
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:23,730
I'm done after this.

3103
01:57:26,410 --> 01:57:28,090
This feels like Sunday.

3104
01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:28,210
Sunday.

3105
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:45,000
Blocks.

3106
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:51,140
What the fuck?

3107
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,600
So much defense here.

3108
01:57:58,940 --> 01:57:59,220
Yeah.

3109
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:01,080
All right, all right.

3110
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:02,900
Yeah, that's just Juri in a nutshell.

3111
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:04,240
She just overwhelms you.

3112
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:04,540
Yeah.

3113
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:07,940
The zoning.

3114
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:16,290
Oh, nice.

3115
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:17,730
The defense is on point, though.

3116
01:58:17,730 --> 01:58:18,390
Holy shit.

3117
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:20,930
It's just whoever messes up first.

3118
01:58:21,550 --> 01:58:22,170
Mm-hmm.

3119
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:24,090
Which is scary.

3120
01:58:24,350 --> 01:58:25,250
Nice anti-air.

3121
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:25,630
Nice.

3122
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:29,510
Oh, nice carry.

3123
01:58:30,790 --> 01:58:32,070
Oh, that works.

3124
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:32,530
Oh, my God.

3125
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:34,570
Is that level one?

3126
01:58:35,230 --> 01:58:36,170
Level one, yeah.

3127
01:58:37,450 --> 01:58:38,710
Let's save, I think.

3128
01:58:42,210 --> 01:58:43,130
Oh, damn.

3129
01:58:43,170 --> 01:58:43,990
Back in the corner.

3130
01:58:44,010 --> 01:58:44,310
All right.

3131
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:45,530
Here we go.

3132
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:48,330
Good reactions.

3133
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:51,450
Oh.

3134
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:52,490
This is rough.

3135
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:55,610
Oh, my God.

3136
01:58:55,610 --> 01:58:56,650
Oh, that was close.

3137
01:58:57,090 --> 01:58:57,670
Yeah.

3138
01:58:57,670 --> 01:58:57,870
All right.

3139
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:58,170
GG.

3140
01:58:58,250 --> 01:58:58,830
GG.

3141
01:59:00,610 --> 01:59:02,730
That was intense, though.

3142
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:04,610
That was super intense.

3143
01:59:04,970 --> 01:59:05,290
Yeah.

3144
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:07,430
That was close.

3145
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:08,490
It was.

3146
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:08,870
It was.

3147
01:59:08,870 --> 01:59:10,310
And you had him in that last move.

3148
01:59:11,430 --> 01:59:11,550
Yeah.

3149
01:59:12,490 --> 01:59:13,890
Yeah, and it does a ton of chip.

3150
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:15,330
I didn't realize how much chip that did.

3151
01:59:15,570 --> 01:59:17,490
I think Lily's back for real.

3152
01:59:18,790 --> 01:59:19,410
Oh, flip.

3153
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:20,610
Heads.

3154
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:23,190
Heads.

3155
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:25,770
Every time heads, you're not...

3156
01:59:25,770 --> 01:59:28,710
I swear to God, if I get P2, I have heads.

3157
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:34,450
You're an always rock player, aren't you?

3158
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:34,710
All right.

3159
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:34,970
Hold on.

3160
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:36,670
Doki is the main event.

3161
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,230
Yeah, true.

3162
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:37,870
No.

3163
01:59:40,130 --> 01:59:42,570
You're the tiebreaker now, right?

3164
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:42,910
No.

3165
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:45,490
Yeah, you are the tiebreaker, Doki.

3166
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:46,350
No pressure.

3167
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:48,530
No pressure, Doki, but you are the tiebreaker.

3168
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:50,330
I reserved myself, all right.

3169
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:50,950
Right.

3170
01:59:51,070 --> 01:59:54,550
We don't go to TwitchCon if you don't win this, remember?

3171
01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:55,270
Okay.

3172
01:59:55,310 --> 01:59:56,290
Yeah, remember that.

3173
01:59:56,870 --> 01:59:57,390
It's okay.

3174
01:59:57,630 --> 01:59:58,710
We don't need TwitchCon.

3175
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:01,050
We have the power of friendship together.

3176
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:08,530
Yeah, who needs TwitchCon?

3177
02:00:08,590 --> 02:00:09,470
We can watch party together.

3178
02:00:09,930 --> 02:00:13,250
I don't remember if Lily jumps this.

3179
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:14,230
Oh, she does.

3180
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:14,730
Okay.

3181
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:19,390
Okay, sorry.

3182
02:00:19,530 --> 02:00:21,350
I'm out of my groove because of this.

3183
02:00:22,610 --> 02:00:24,410
Oh, she jumps a lot.

3184
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:26,530
You know what to do.

3185
02:00:26,830 --> 02:00:26,930
Yeah.

3186
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:28,630
Let's go.

3187
02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:30,410
All right.

3188
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:33,010
She hits through that.

3189
02:00:35,070 --> 02:00:35,590
Okay.

3190
02:00:38,630 --> 02:00:38,960
Nice.

3191
02:00:39,410 --> 02:00:40,050
Okay.

3192
02:00:41,630 --> 02:00:42,290
Oh.

3193
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:43,490
I thought she was going to jump.

3194
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:45,010
Yeah.

3195
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:47,670
All right.

3196
02:00:49,530 --> 02:00:50,770
You got this, Doki.

3197
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:53,090
Let's go.

3198
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:57,920
Oh.

3199
02:00:58,220 --> 02:00:58,880
Nice.

3200
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:06,800
She hits.

3201
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,060
Damn.

3202
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:10,900
Yep.

3203
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:11,920
Let's conserve your meter.

3204
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:12,580
Okay.

3205
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:18,240
Oh, I forgot that.

3206
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:18,780
Yeah.

3207
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:22,040
Oh.

3208
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:24,000
Oh.

3209
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:25,340
Oh, so close.

3210
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,140
Do I hit this?

3211
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:31,540
I do.

3212
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:31,920
Okay.

3213
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:33,160
Do I hit this?

3214
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:33,500
Yes.

3215
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:34,160
The classic.

3216
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:35,280
Okay.

3217
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:36,940
You're going to need one more hit.

3218
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:37,760
Yeah.

3219
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:38,320
One more.

3220
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:39,160
He might super on wake up.

3221
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:40,260
No, but he might super.

3222
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:43,260
I mean, just the overhead will be nice.

3223
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:45,120
Just block.

3224
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:46,500
What?

3225
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:49,000
That's so unfortunate.

3226
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:54,040
I don't know what that move was.

3227
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:54,180
Yeah, that's just hard.

3228
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:54,680
Yeah.

3229
02:01:56,020 --> 02:01:56,400
Familiarity.

3230
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:57,240
Smiley out of range.

3231
02:01:58,120 --> 02:01:59,200
But you had the right read.

3232
02:01:59,620 --> 02:02:00,000
Yeah.

3233
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:01,020
Okay.

3234
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:02,140
Nice.

3235
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:03,700
You got this.

3236
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:04,040
You got this.

3237
02:02:06,340 --> 02:02:07,400
That would have been sick.

3238
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:08,880
Okay.

3239
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:09,920
There you go.

3240
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:11,160
There we go.

3241
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:12,860
Let's go.

3242
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:14,180
Oh, yeah.

3243
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:15,960
Oh, yeah.

3244
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:17,060
Go ham.

3245
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:18,720
Do your thing.

3246
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:19,760
Okay.

3247
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:20,340
She's burnt out.

3248
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:22,460
Nice jump.

3249
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:23,620
Oh.

3250
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:28,380
You can do DI, yeah.

3251
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:29,240
Okay.

3252
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:34,120
I didn't remember that's a plus.

3253
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:35,500
Is that what it's called?

3254
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:37,520
You got it.

3255
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:39,860
Is that what plus means?

3256
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:42,340
Is that what plus means?

3257
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:43,160
Okay.

3258
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:43,720
Yes.

3259
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,200
Yes.

3260
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:45,300
That is a plus.

3261
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:50,240
Now that I know what plus means.

3262
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:51,340
Almighty.

3263
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:52,760
Yeehaw.

3264
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:53,580
Yeehaw.

3265
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:54,860
Yeah.

3266
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:58,060
But keep playing.

3267
02:02:58,220 --> 02:02:59,980
But yeah, just don't do too many drive rushes right now.

3268
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:01,680
Get closer.

3269
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:02,580
Okay.

3270
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:06,640
So she has no stores.

3271
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:08,020
Going.

3272
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:09,420
Get closer to her.

3273
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:17,360
So she's going to do that move randomly and fly at you.

3274
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:18,020
So she's going to do that move randomly and fly at you.

3275
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:19,720
Yeah.

3276
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:23,240
Let's go, my loyal fans.

3277
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,200
Let's go, my loyal fans.

3278
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:26,160
Well played.

3279
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:28,680
My loyal fans.

3280
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:33,160
I hate, I hate playing against Lily.

3281
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:34,360
That's my bird.

3282
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:35,880
That's my bird.

3283
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:37,460
It never changes.

3284
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:39,900
It's so hard to predict.

3285
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:43,640
It's like...

3286
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:44,200
Nice.

3287
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:46,420
Almighty.

3288
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:47,460
Yeehaw.

3289
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:48,600
Yeehaw.

3290
02:03:49,740 --> 02:03:50,140
Yeah.

3291
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:52,400
Now she's...

3292
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:55,440
Oh, she jumps now.

3293
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:58,020
Yeah, but she's plus there.

3294
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,920
So you want to jump.

3295
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,540
Don't do triangle after that one.

3296
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:01,940
That's when you got to get away from her.

3297
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:03,300
So she has it.

3298
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:04,180
Now she's going to do it.

3299
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:04,740
Okay.

3300
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:05,580
That's fine.

3301
02:04:05,620 --> 02:04:07,600
Take that.

3302
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:08,020
That's fine.

3303
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:09,840
Woo wee.

3304
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:10,700
Go ham.

3305
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,820
Okay, she's going to do it again.

3306
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:16,540
Did I jump this?

3307
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,900
You just keep moving towards her and blocking.

3308
02:04:20,620 --> 02:04:21,580
Okay, she has three of them.

3309
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:23,440
So she's going to try to throw one at you randomly.

3310
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:26,620
But you can try to jump at her with like X if you get a little closer.

3311
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,540
But if she does the move, just block and jump.

3312
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:30,680
Oh.

3313
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:32,340
That's fine.

3314
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:32,560
That's fine.

3315
02:04:32,980 --> 02:04:33,400
It's okay.

3316
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:33,620
It's okay.

3317
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:34,320
Composure.

3318
02:04:38,980 --> 02:04:39,380
Oh.

3319
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:39,860
Oh.

3320
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:40,380
Okay.

3321
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:41,400
Okay, just block.

3322
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:44,080
You can try like dry rush overhead.

3323
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:45,500
But like a burst option.

3324
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:46,960
But if she does that move, you know what to do.

3325
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:47,980
Oh.

3326
02:04:51,580 --> 02:04:53,820
That shit was like American Ninja, dude.

3327
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:54,200
That shit was like American Ninja, dude.

3328
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:55,080
That was so sick.

3329
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,860
That's a neutral game.

3330
02:04:57,580 --> 02:04:58,740
That's the neutral Doki.

3331
02:04:58,860 --> 02:05:00,900
You get your side now.

3332
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:01,880
Doki, you get your side.

3333
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:03,500
Oh my god.

3334
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:04,040
I'm on the side.

3335
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:06,020
I'm not used to that.

3336
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:08,000
No.

3337
02:05:08,120 --> 02:05:08,540
Alright.

3338
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:09,660
Now we got excuses.

3339
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,100
Cause she been playing.

3340
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:12,320
Go in.

3341
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:12,520
Go in.

3342
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:12,740
Go in.

3343
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:13,760
Okay.

3344
02:05:14,660 --> 02:05:16,540
I did not mean to do that, but okay.

3345
02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:18,220
Now you can go in.

3346
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:19,140
Okay.

3347
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:20,640
Oh yeah.

3348
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,840
You can keep the pressure up.

3349
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,480
Oh my god.

3350
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:27,200
She's disgusting.

3351
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:28,660
That's so funny.

3352
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:30,780
That was...

3353
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:32,980
I love this face of Doki.

3354
02:05:32,980 --> 02:05:33,900
You hated the shit out of her.

3355
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:35,020
Okay.

3356
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:35,460
That's fine.

3357
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:36,180
That's fine.

3358
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:37,320
You don't have to worry about it.

3359
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:39,440
I don't know.

3360
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:39,920
I think she died.

3361
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:40,760
Oh my god.

3362
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,580
She's so sick.

3363
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:45,400
Here they go.

3364
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:48,900
Doki, you are actually a menace, dude.

3365
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,460
You are undefeated on this team.

3366
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:50,940
Did you know that?

3367
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:53,320
You won the tiebreaker for us.

3368
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:55,280
You won the tiebreaker.

3369
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:57,380
We're going to TwitchCon.

3370
02:05:57,940 --> 02:05:58,460
We're going to TwitchCon.

3371
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:59,040
We're going to TwitchCon.

3372
02:05:59,040 --> 02:05:59,800
We're going to TwitchCon.

3373
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:00,380
We're going to TwitchCon.

3374
02:06:00,380 --> 02:06:00,380
We're going to TwitchCon.

3375
02:06:00,380 --> 02:06:00,460
We're going to TwitchCon.

3376
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:02,660
Ryan would not have had to play this.

3377
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,180
No, Brian wouldn't have to play this.

3378
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:06,160
All my faith in you guys.

3379
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:07,220
Good job.

3380
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:11,900
You are the only one on this team that's undefeated, Doki.

3381
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:13,280
No, don't jinx me!

3382
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,060
No pressure, though.

3383
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:17,940
The jinx!

3384
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:19,320
Did I lose?

3385
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:19,600
No pressure.

3386
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:21,840
Did you lose to the DJ?

3387
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:23,080
No.

3388
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:29,080
I think he lost to JP only.

3389
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:30,600
No, I beat him.

3390
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,000
Wait, where am I, dude?

3391
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:34,720
What the fuck?

3392
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:36,340
Where am I?

3393
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,860
Wait a minute, do we have two people undefeated?

3394
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,960
Hold on a minute, I'm lost.

3395
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:43,780
I lost to Roy last time, not today.

3396
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:45,120
Not yet.

3397
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:48,780
Damn, alright!

3398
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,840
No, no, no, that's the target.

3399
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:51,220
That's crazy.

3400
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:55,520
The only thing, BrawlPro, is that you're still doing a lot of nice SPDs.

3401
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,000
That's the thing that got you killed against Roy.

3402
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,100
Let's just minimize that.

3403
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:00,320
I'll just chill on it.

3404
02:07:00,540 --> 02:07:02,760
I mean, who are you fighting against?

3405
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:03,940
Diaphone's team, though?

3406
02:07:04,540 --> 02:07:07,640
It's Fi, and then also Roy is left.

3407
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:08,480
Against PDX.

3408
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:09,960
Who am I fighting?

3409
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,300
Who's the next game?

3410
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:14,040
Apparently, Shine, 5-0, Diaphone's team.

3411
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:16,560
That's crazy, holy shit.

3412
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:18,400
That's actually really good.

3413
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:19,220
That's not good for us.

3414
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:25,500
I'm really hoping that the next team just destroys them.

3415
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:27,100
Is it updating?

3416
02:07:27,620 --> 02:07:28,640
Is it updating?

3417
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:30,300
Yeah, it is.

3418
02:07:30,640 --> 02:07:32,220
It's automatic now, the scores.

3419
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:35,320
Yeah, it's on round day 2 results.

3420
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:36,680
Um...

3421
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:38,560
I don't know.

3422
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:39,480
Our points aren't updating.

3423
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:40,760
Nah, not yet.

3424
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,100
I think we gotta wait till the end.

3425
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:44,320
And then we can audit again, you know?

3426
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:46,480
Oh no, there is an update.

3427
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:47,840
They played more games than us, though.

3428
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:50,040
If we look at it right now, it's not over.

3429
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:52,140
We have the most points by 50.

3430
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:54,360
We have 50, the next one has 30.

3431
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:55,180
So that's...

3432
02:07:55,180 --> 02:07:56,120
Well, we're ahead.

3433
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:59,800
My chat's saying we're like two wins behind Nephew's team.

3434
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,220
Damn, that'd be sick.

3435
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:04,200
Well, is that overall?

3436
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:06,060
I guess.

3437
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:10,140
To be fair, though, Sunday is where this shit matters for real.

3438
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:11,960
But we get a buy, though.

3439
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:13,620
If we get the buy, we're automatically...

3440
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:16,480
I need to get top of the leaderboard, you don't understand.

3441
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:19,280
Do we automatically go to TwitchCon?

3442
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:19,880
No, that's not true.

3443
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:22,440
No, we have to win only one if we get a buy.

3444
02:08:22,780 --> 02:08:23,220
Okay.

3445
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:25,780
We have to go to TwitchCon.

3446
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:26,920
If we get a buy.

3447
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:28,960
If we don't get a buy, we have to win two.

3448
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:29,960
That's a lot.

3449
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:31,100
Two is more than one.

3450
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:37,000
So on Sunday, what are they gonna do?

3451
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:38,980
Only, like, we'll only have to play one time?

3452
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:41,080
Because they want to do the top four at TwitchCon?

3453
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:41,300
Yeah.

3454
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:43,980
Because only four teams make it in.

3455
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:46,120
Wait, that's gonna be a really fast finals.

3456
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:47,360
Yeah.

3457
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:51,260
Maybe Seijin has some other stuff planned.

3458
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:52,400
Maybe there'll be show matches.

3459
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:53,140
Possibly.

3460
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:55,320
Maybe.

3461
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:57,520
Okay, they should put us up against JB's team.

3462
02:08:57,920 --> 02:08:59,320
For the first game.

3463
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,480
Yeah, can we do that?

3464
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:04,640
I love those guys, I think.

3465
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:06,280
But, I don't know.

3466
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:09,140
What do we have here?

3467
02:09:09,620 --> 02:09:10,940
We'll have to run to the bathroom though.

3468
02:09:10,980 --> 02:09:11,440
I'll be right back.

3469
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:15,480
Oh, I don't have the...

3470
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:16,580
No, it should be Trinity.

3471
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:18,840
But it's from Slamman.

3472
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:21,700
I only have Slamman and Claire.

3473
02:09:21,860 --> 02:09:22,240
That's it.

3474
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:24,300
Yeah, Slamman is Trinity.

3475
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:25,480
Trinity's in the lobby.

3476
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:27,400
Wait, what the fuck?

3477
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:28,480
Wait, Trinity is in the lobby.

3478
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:31,820
Trinity said the CFN we're looking for is Trinity 5.

3479
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:32,980
Oh, okay.

3480
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,720
Oh, I don't have...

3481
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:36,900
You're saying they're in the Slamman lobby?

3482
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:38,800
Yeah, they're in the Slamman lobby.

3483
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:42,040
I'm literally with the Trinity 5 people.

3484
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:44,100
Well, why is JB in here?

3485
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:45,460
Yeah, I was like, why is he in here?

3486
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,180
Oh, okay.

3487
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:48,900
So we're not the crazy ones.

3488
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:49,620
Okay, cool.

3489
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:51,040
I was like, what are you talking about?

3490
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:51,620
He's right here.

3491
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:54,460
Okay.

3492
02:09:54,940 --> 02:09:55,380
Cool.

3493
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:57,540
Alright.

3494
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:01,880
I don't know if I played enough against...

3495
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:04,680
I heard that Sykkuno practiced hard against...

3496
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:04,820
I heard that Sykkuno practiced hard against...

3497
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:05,420
This is Sykkuno?

3498
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:08,980
I heard he practiced really hard against Gif, so I'm like a little nervous.

3499
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:10,600
My only note for you against Sykkuno...

3500
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:11,820
My only note for you against Sykkuno...

3501
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,640
was LOL.

3502
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:15,940
Yeah, I saw that!

3503
02:10:15,980 --> 02:10:18,380
I was like, oh no, he could've learned new moves!

3504
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:22,000
I wrote like a page and a half for you.

3505
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:24,960
Or two pages total, but Sykkuno's one line.

3506
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:25,380
Yeah.

3507
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:26,440
I think it was too quick!

3508
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:33,760
No, it's cause like, literally before the tournament started, I got him in rank and it tilted him.

3509
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:38,060
But I didn't play rank today, so I don't know...

3510
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,680
I didn't play rank today.

3511
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:43,820
So I don't know if it tilted him or not.

3512
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:45,120
If he's gonna be tilted or not.

3513
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:47,260
Yeah, I didn't realize until after.

3514
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:49,760
It's like, oh, he went four and one only losing to you.

3515
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:54,520
I heard the strat is he does jab, jab, jab and if it hits, he goes to spiral arrow.

3516
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,240
Yeah, he spams jab a lot.

3517
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:58,160
That's what I noticed.

3518
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:02,120
So if you block that, then it's over and he'll just cancel the DI and you can counter DI.

3519
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:05,000
So blocking when he knocks you down might be good.

3520
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:08,060
But everything else you're doing when you're attacking is just keep doing it.

3521
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:10,900
He already lost the match, just to let you know.

3522
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:12,060
Okay, nice.

3523
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:14,220
So his confidence has been shooketh.

3524
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:15,060
Shooketh.

3525
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:16,740
He's got a crown.

3526
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:17,960
He's gonna crumble this side of Doki.

3527
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:22,880
I cannot get over this frame one P one side strat that she's got going.

3528
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:26,820
Everyone's got She's got everyone playing heads or tails.

3529
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:29,980
The influence right now.

3530
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,560
Oh my gosh.

3531
02:11:33,820 --> 02:11:35,640
The influence that this bird has.

3532
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,240
Why is it, dude?

3533
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:39,580
This is rigged.

3534
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:40,840
It's good.

3535
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,320
It's like Uno chose heads.

3536
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:43,600
Oh, Diddy.

3537
02:11:43,660 --> 02:11:44,300
Oh, my bad.

3538
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,100
You know what side.

3539
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:49,180
That's funny.

3540
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:50,400
Leave the queue.

3541
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:52,920
Here comes a new challenger.

3542
02:11:58,440 --> 02:11:59,060
All right.

3543
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:00,940
I don't remember how he plays though.

3544
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:02,280
I didn't bump into him in rank.

3545
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:05,040
That's the only reason I remember how he plays.

3546
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:08,920
The only thing is if he knocks you down, just try to block for a little while and then he'll do DI.

3547
02:12:09,220 --> 02:12:11,340
But everything else, just keep doing what you're doing.

3548
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:12,640
Is this Slamman or Last Clair?

3549
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:14,080
Slamman.

3550
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:15,060
Okay.

3551
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:15,260
Okay.

3552
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:18,700
Yeah, so he does DI like that.

3553
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:20,680
All right.

3554
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:22,580
Okay.

3555
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:26,280
Oh, he started grabbing now.

3556
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:27,520
That's good for him.

3557
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:29,040
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

3558
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:30,440
Oh, yeah.

3559
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:35,740
Oh, I wanted to grab him first, but he got me.

3560
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:38,320
Yeah, he's jumping and throwing.

3561
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:40,560
So he's throwing over and over.

3562
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:41,040
Yeah.

3563
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:42,640
Okay, that's his strat now.

3564
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:47,920
He's just going to try to throw you over and over.

3565
02:12:47,980 --> 02:12:49,200
Yeah, he's trying to throw you at me.

3566
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,080
This is quite a match.

3567
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,140
Yeah, that's nice.

3568
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:55,620
If he jumps and throws, you can just punish him on the ground.

3569
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:56,180
Oh, okay.

3570
02:12:57,220 --> 02:13:00,380
When he's jumping in the air like that and whiffing a throw, just throw him when he lands.

3571
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:01,220
Okay.

3572
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:04,440
That's very not real.

3573
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:04,860
Nice!

3574
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:05,160
Nice.

3575
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:08,380
Okay.

3576
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:12,040
That's okay.

3577
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:13,680
There's a tickle.

3578
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:15,620
Oh, he's on classic?

3579
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:17,640
Yeah, he is.

3580
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:19,760
Oh my god, did y'all see that?

3581
02:13:20,260 --> 02:13:20,980
The combo?

3582
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:23,360
Nice punish.

3583
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:24,680
Oh, the booty.

3584
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:27,120
We got a focus squad.

3585
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:29,400
It's hard!

3586
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:31,800
Yeah!

3587
02:13:32,360 --> 02:13:33,600
Nice one, Doki!

3588
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:34,320
Nice!

3589
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:36,780
Do that again.

3590
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:42,060
About to start breaking out the dollar bills real soon here.

3591
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:45,040
And you remember, he's looking to throw now.

3592
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:47,740
Nice try.

3593
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:49,540
Block that move.

3594
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:50,740
Thank you, Doki.

3595
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:54,280
Nice, good patience.

3596
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:56,040
Oh my god.

3597
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:00,280
Oh my god!

3598
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:01,620
That was so sick.

3599
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,260
That was actually so good.

3600
02:14:06,820 --> 02:14:08,120
Doki's actually tanked.

3601
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:09,800
Oh my goodness!

3602
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:10,620
She's cracked!

3603
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:12,280
That was okay.

3604
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:14,160
Alright, that's good.

3605
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:16,680
Well played, well played.

3606
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:18,960
I legit think she's the best player.

3607
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:21,800
I don't know what I'm doing!

3608
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:22,700
What the hell?

3609
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:26,500
I'm not strategizing, I'm just playing.

3610
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:31,500
Listen, you can sandbag for your opponents, but you can come clean to us.

3611
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:35,680
I'm literally just...

3612
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:38,280
My head is just like...

3613
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:39,960
I do... okay, I do this now.

3614
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:40,680
Like...

3615
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:43,600
Yeah, and it worked!

3616
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:46,240
Nah, dude.

3617
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:48,920
Let's do it, dude.

3618
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:51,220
I'm about to jump out the window.

3619
02:14:51,320 --> 02:14:53,220
I can't, dude.

3620
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:55,280
I can't, dude.

3621
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:58,460
Okay.

3622
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:02,060
Dude, you're giving him emotional damage.

3623
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:04,640
He's not gonna be the same person after this.

3624
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:07,740
Oh.

3625
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:09,620
He throws me first, cause I...

3626
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:10,540
Okay.

3627
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:12,920
He gets your look back!

3628
02:15:13,140 --> 02:15:13,720
Let's go.

3629
02:15:16,300 --> 02:15:17,140
He's blind!

3630
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:19,100
Toki, he's blind!

3631
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:21,340
I don't know if he jumps.

3632
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:22,040
Does he jump?

3633
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:22,660
No, he doesn't.

3634
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:23,120
Okay.

3635
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:23,720
Oh god!

3636
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:27,960
One more.

3637
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:31,780
He's gonna be broken after this.

3638
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:36,100
He doesn't know what's going on.

3639
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:37,000
No!

3640
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,680
Let's go, Toki.

3641
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:42,720
Okay.

3642
02:15:45,420 --> 02:15:46,060
It's over.

3643
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:47,120
Let's go, Toki.

3644
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:48,720
It's crazy.

3645
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:52,160
5-0, Sykuna.

3646
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:53,320
5-0.

3647
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:54,380
This is crazy.

3648
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:56,880
Nah, this is insane.

3649
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:58,720
I'm losing my mind here.

3650
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:02,820
So who are you fighting?

3651
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:05,620
I can't believe that Toki has footsies.

3652
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:08,100
So, Eske, the only thing about Amore is...

3653
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:09,680
He DI'd so much.

3654
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:12,540
He DI'd a bunch, and also...

3655
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:16,100
He jumps back a lot, too.

3656
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:18,760
The medium punch, heavy punch target combo?

3657
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:19,300
Yeah.

3658
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:21,460
They always do medium punch, heavy punch.

3659
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:23,160
And that's just unsafe on block.

3660
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,300
And if they cancel to DI, you DI back.

3661
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:27,580
So it's that one, two punch.

3662
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:29,160
Always spams that.

3663
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:30,620
And you can just press medium punch after.

3664
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:35,040
And if they DI cancel it, you cancel your medium to DI.

3665
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:36,600
Other than that, player game.

3666
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:40,280
I still don't know what I'm doing.

3667
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:44,100
Toki, I never want you to know what neutral is.

3668
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:47,520
We need to keep you as pure as possible.

3669
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:50,020
I believe in you, Eske.

3670
02:16:51,140 --> 02:16:51,780
Thank you.

3671
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:53,820
Eske, you got this, Chica.

3672
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:57,480
It's a battle of the... I think we're both one and something.

3673
02:16:57,800 --> 02:16:58,820
Or like two and six.

3674
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:00,620
This is about to be your second dub.

3675
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:03,760
I think you both went one and four the first day, I think.

3676
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:04,680
Yup, yup.

3677
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:06,780
Now she's gonna be one and four.

3678
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:10,260
Believe in you.

3679
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:13,360
It didn't start, did it?

3680
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:14,800
No, we're waiting.

3681
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:17,820
We need to wait a second.

3682
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:19,820
Okay, okay, I got it.

3683
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:20,320
I'm going now.

3684
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:23,980
They gotta give Sykkuno some therapy real quick.

3685
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:27,500
I can't believe we're making the Triforce of birds, dude.

3686
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:30,440
We got Angry Bird, Big Bird, and now Doki Bird.

3687
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:33,180
Triforce of birds, dude.

3688
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:36,080
I got the bird in me.

3689
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:39,320
I got that bird in me.

3690
02:17:41,060 --> 02:17:42,600
With the power of the birds.

3691
02:17:45,140 --> 02:17:46,980
I think you sent Sykkuno to therapy.

3692
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:48,120
I'm getting that.

3693
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:49,240
Yeah, yeah.

3694
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:55,460
Oh, that's new.

3695
02:17:57,520 --> 02:17:58,000
Nice.

3696
02:18:11,580 --> 02:18:12,060
Oh.

3697
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:14,600
No worries, no worries.

3698
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:17,200
Nice.

3699
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:17,840
Okay, nice.

3700
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:21,380
Nice.

3701
02:18:25,970 --> 02:18:26,370
Ouch.

3702
02:18:26,810 --> 02:18:29,690
Yeah, they're gonna spam that and then throw you after.

3703
02:18:30,610 --> 02:18:31,010
Okay.

3704
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:31,790
Dragon Lash.

3705
02:18:31,930 --> 02:18:32,370
It's plus?

3706
02:18:32,410 --> 02:18:33,590
You can DP it.

3707
02:18:33,870 --> 02:18:35,490
Oh, I can DI it?

3708
02:18:35,530 --> 02:18:35,990
Oh, DP it.

3709
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:40,110
You can DI it or DP it, but it's just hard to react to, but if you block, she's plus.

3710
02:18:40,130 --> 02:18:40,470
That's all.

3711
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:41,590
Ha!

3712
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:52,530
Oh, bro, you left.

3713
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:54,350
Yeah, it kicked me out.

3714
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:55,330
That's toxic.

3715
02:18:56,490 --> 02:18:57,670
Oh, it kicked me out.

3716
02:18:57,690 --> 02:18:58,170
I'm toxic.

3717
02:18:59,570 --> 02:19:00,450
Talking that shit.

3718
02:19:00,630 --> 02:19:01,370
That's what you get.

3719
02:19:04,390 --> 02:19:04,750
Nice.

3720
02:19:04,850 --> 02:19:05,030
Nice grab.

3721
02:19:07,930 --> 02:19:08,290
Nice.

3722
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:12,290
Good try.

3723
02:19:13,190 --> 02:19:14,130
Let's wait a second here.

3724
02:19:15,090 --> 02:19:15,450
Okay.

3725
02:19:15,470 --> 02:19:15,650
Yeah.

3726
02:19:17,350 --> 02:19:20,990
So, they're really good at countering DI, but they will also throw a random DI.

3727
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:22,450
I'm not gonna press it anymore.

3728
02:19:22,710 --> 02:19:23,430
Yeah, it's just...

3729
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:25,450
That's about it.

3730
02:19:25,630 --> 02:19:26,870
Do I just need to hold block more?

3731
02:19:28,510 --> 02:19:30,570
You're mashing sweep, crouching heavy kick.

3732
02:19:30,750 --> 02:19:32,530
I want you to not use that move.

3733
02:19:33,310 --> 02:19:36,530
That's a new habit I think you got since I last saw you.

3734
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:37,950
Don't use that.

3735
02:19:38,850 --> 02:19:39,210
Okay.

3736
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:41,150
It's getting you killed in all these matches I've noticed.

3737
02:19:41,310 --> 02:19:43,770
So if you can just, in those moments, just block a little bit more.

3738
02:19:44,810 --> 02:19:45,630
And then you're good.

3739
02:19:45,670 --> 02:19:45,850
Okay.

3740
02:19:47,290 --> 02:19:47,670
Okay.

3741
02:19:49,530 --> 02:19:51,030
Oh my gosh, Sycuna reported me.

3742
02:19:51,050 --> 02:19:52,750
You're jumping over all of my...

3743
02:19:54,090 --> 02:19:54,470
Fireballs.

3744
02:19:55,590 --> 02:19:56,270
All of... yeah.

3745
02:19:57,850 --> 02:19:58,230
Yeah.

3746
02:19:58,730 --> 02:20:00,190
You gotta back up and let them jump.

3747
02:20:01,130 --> 02:20:01,510
Okay.

3748
02:20:01,770 --> 02:20:04,490
This is the type of player where you kinda let them come to you.

3749
02:20:04,630 --> 02:20:09,830
And if you get the DP knockdown, then you can dry rush in medium, and then if they block that, go for a throw or something.

3750
02:20:10,170 --> 02:20:13,870
But they're gonna always jump forward, or they're gonna always do dragon lash.

3751
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:18,470
And both those options could be interrupted by DP, or, you know, dragon lash with DI.

3752
02:20:18,750 --> 02:20:19,330
But they're...

3753
02:20:19,330 --> 02:20:23,590
If you get too close to them, they're gonna try to jump over you, and that's gonna be really awkward to anti-air.

3754
02:20:23,850 --> 02:20:29,270
So if you keep distance and then get knockdown, then dry rush when you get a clean knockdown, you can pressure.

3755
02:20:29,790 --> 02:20:31,850
If your pressure ends, don't mash sweep.

3756
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:34,170
That's not a good habit to have.

3757
02:20:34,450 --> 02:20:35,550
So just block it out.

3758
02:20:35,790 --> 02:20:36,150
Okay.

3759
02:20:36,150 --> 02:20:38,710
And then maybe backdash once you block a few moves and try again.

3760
02:20:39,510 --> 02:20:40,290
Okay, got it.

3761
02:20:42,430 --> 02:20:43,070
Let's go.

3762
02:20:44,650 --> 02:20:45,310
Let's go.

3763
02:20:45,570 --> 02:20:45,690
Let's go, SK!

3764
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:46,670
Let's go!

3765
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:48,370
I'm rooting.

3766
02:20:48,730 --> 02:20:48,910
I'm rooting.

3767
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:53,350
You gave her that hesitation.

3768
02:20:58,110 --> 02:20:59,330
Iced her out.

3769
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:07,780
I wanna make the pouty face.

3770
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:13,460
Yeah, get those mind games in the pre-lobby.

3771
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:13,780
Yeah.

3772
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:21,930
Gotta do this.

3773
02:21:22,030 --> 02:21:22,790
Come on.

3774
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:24,810
Oops.

3775
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:30,420
Hadouken!

3776
02:21:30,660 --> 02:21:31,140
Hadouken!

3777
02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:34,600
Dragon buzzy, actually.

3778
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:36,520
Yeah, there you go.

3779
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:37,560
Nice.

3780
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:39,980
Yeah, they messed up.

3781
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:40,300
Yeah.

3782
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:41,940
How can I watch?

3783
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:46,740
How's this?

3784
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:47,220
Oh, nice!

3785
02:21:47,620 --> 02:21:48,180
Nice!

3786
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:52,560
Oh, nice.

3787
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:52,700
Nice tech.

3788
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:53,280
Ooh.

3789
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:54,500
There we go.

3790
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:54,940
Oh, yeah!

3791
02:21:57,320 --> 02:21:57,760
Cool.

3792
02:21:58,540 --> 02:21:59,420
I pressed sweep.

3793
02:21:59,480 --> 02:21:59,840
Not bad.

3794
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:00,380
That's fine.

3795
02:22:00,660 --> 02:22:01,540
No, that was a punish.

3796
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:02,480
Sweeps with sweeps.

3797
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:02,940
That's great.

3798
02:22:03,360 --> 02:22:04,080
Okay, okay.

3799
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:06,520
But otherwise, this is chill.

3800
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:07,400
But you're doing great.

3801
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:12,100
Ow.

3802
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:13,420
Just the idea to block.

3803
02:22:15,420 --> 02:22:16,680
And now it's time to DI.

3804
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:17,520
Yes!

3805
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:19,160
So good, actually.

3806
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:23,550
Oh, I'm old.

3807
02:22:25,490 --> 02:22:26,310
No, it's okay.

3808
02:22:26,390 --> 02:22:27,670
You couldn't DI cancel that.

3809
02:22:27,670 --> 02:22:29,450
Yeah, you did a cancelable move.

3810
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:31,470
So you can't DI there.

3811
02:22:31,930 --> 02:22:34,810
Still DI when her back is against the wall, low on HP.

3812
02:22:35,070 --> 02:22:36,030
It's like a trump card.

3813
02:22:36,670 --> 02:22:37,110
Yeah.

3814
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:37,650
Okay.

3815
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:40,190
She said, oh, I'm old.

3816
02:22:44,310 --> 02:22:44,750
Nice.

3817
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:45,090
Oh, nice.

3818
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:46,730
That's a sick jump.

3819
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:53,640
What?

3820
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:55,660
What did I just saw?

3821
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:57,600
Nice grab.

3822
02:22:57,780 --> 02:22:59,380
She's gonna mash something.

3823
02:22:59,540 --> 02:22:59,760
Let's go.

3824
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:03,380
Oh, nice.

3825
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:03,860
Nice!

3826
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:05,720
Get her!

3827
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:08,120
What a jump!

3828
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:09,160
Holy shit!

3829
02:23:09,620 --> 02:23:10,160
Great.

3830
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:11,260
That jump was insane.

3831
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:12,920
Jumpy.

3832
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:15,340
I'm going in.

3833
02:23:17,380 --> 02:23:18,140
Oh, I like that.

3834
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:19,240
I'm going in.

3835
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:20,040
Block.

3836
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:20,540
Oh, block.

3837
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:21,200
Nice.

3838
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:21,760
Sorry.

3839
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:24,240
Yeah.

3840
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:26,160
Yeah!

3841
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:26,960
Get her!

3842
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:29,220
Oh my god!

3843
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,060
She jumped!

3844
02:23:30,140 --> 02:23:31,040
You caught her!

3845
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:32,300
You caught her jump!

3846
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:34,140
It wasn't a combo, but we take those.

3847
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:35,100
It was a read.

3848
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:35,800
It was a read.

3849
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:36,980
She knew the jump was coming.

3850
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:39,760
Okay, yeah.

3851
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:42,260
No more.

3852
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:45,640
They will try to DI you, and you will stop it.

3853
02:23:52,230 --> 02:23:53,090
Oh, okay.

3854
02:23:53,290 --> 02:23:54,850
That was great.

3855
02:23:55,970 --> 02:23:58,010
That was an awesome time to dry rush in also.

3856
02:23:58,310 --> 02:23:59,090
That was great.

3857
02:23:59,210 --> 02:23:59,350
Let's go!

3858
02:24:02,190 --> 02:24:03,070
EMSK, let's go!

3859
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:14,720
Okay.

3860
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:15,500
Good interrupt.

3861
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:18,680
Oops.

3862
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:20,420
That's fine.

3863
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:22,020
Just block, yeah.

3864
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:26,500
Oh, I pressed just...

3865
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:26,980
See?

3866
02:24:26,980 --> 02:24:29,220
You gotta press medium into DI there, yeah.

3867
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:30,260
You're so bad.

3868
02:24:30,980 --> 02:24:31,160
That's cool.

3869
02:24:31,220 --> 02:24:31,760
Just block it out.

3870
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:38,140
Yeah, that's fine.

3871
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:38,700
That's fine.

3872
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:39,320
You see the game plan.

3873
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:40,340
Yep.

3874
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:45,160
My DI reactions are broken today.

3875
02:24:45,980 --> 02:24:46,640
It's okay.

3876
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:46,900
It's okay.

3877
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:48,200
Finals is what matters.

3878
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:49,520
Yep.

3879
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:49,960
Yeah.

3880
02:24:50,380 --> 02:24:50,960
This is...

3881
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:52,840
It's like practice run number two.

3882
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:55,500
Good parries.

3883
02:25:02,170 --> 02:25:02,570
Oh.

3884
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:04,670
Time to DP out.

3885
02:25:04,670 --> 02:25:05,290
Amore.

3886
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:06,450
Oh my god, Amore.

3887
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:07,310
Oh, nice.

3888
02:25:08,790 --> 02:25:09,770
She pressed that.

3889
02:25:09,770 --> 02:25:10,690
That was not a reaction.

3890
02:25:11,130 --> 02:25:12,410
Yeah, she's just doing DI.

3891
02:25:13,390 --> 02:25:14,230
You got this.

3892
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:15,750
And now she's out of meter.

3893
02:25:15,910 --> 02:25:16,110
Yeah.

3894
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:16,790
Oh, yeah.

3895
02:25:16,850 --> 02:25:17,390
Time to go in.

3896
02:25:18,370 --> 02:25:19,750
Only gotta worry about her super.

3897
02:25:19,830 --> 02:25:20,130
That's it.

3898
02:25:24,580 --> 02:25:25,000
That's good.

3899
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:25,820
Just block.

3900
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:26,600
Nice.

3901
02:25:31,530 --> 02:25:32,270
Good defense.

3902
02:25:33,490 --> 02:25:34,250
Good defense.

3903
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:37,110
Nice try.

3904
02:25:37,110 --> 02:25:37,290
Nice try.

3905
02:25:37,350 --> 02:25:37,670
Nice try.

3906
02:25:37,850 --> 02:25:38,750
Good try.

3907
02:25:39,650 --> 02:25:40,530
Oh, man.

3908
02:25:40,610 --> 02:25:42,010
Amore is a DI monster.

3909
02:25:42,270 --> 02:25:43,290
I know, right?

3910
02:25:43,610 --> 02:25:44,810
What the heck is that?

3911
02:25:45,010 --> 02:25:45,630
That's crazy.

3912
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:46,330
It's okay.

3913
02:25:46,330 --> 02:25:46,910
More training.

3914
02:25:46,930 --> 02:25:48,390
More training for Sunday.

3915
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:49,550
Yeah.

3916
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:56,010
Yeah, once you recognize that they're literally just always gonna do DI, it'll click.

3917
02:25:56,390 --> 02:25:59,750
When I play ranked, I react like 90% of the time.

3918
02:26:00,570 --> 02:26:02,370
I think it's just like tournament issues.

3919
02:26:02,370 --> 02:26:04,350
Tournament is a different piece.

3920
02:26:04,530 --> 02:26:04,770
Yeah.

3921
02:26:05,150 --> 02:26:05,590
Yes.

3922
02:26:05,790 --> 02:26:06,230
Yes.

3923
02:26:07,110 --> 02:26:11,170
And they did do it slightly like different timing, but yeah.

3924
02:26:14,010 --> 02:26:15,010
I feel ya.

3925
02:26:15,150 --> 02:26:16,050
It happens.

3926
02:26:17,330 --> 02:26:18,070
Good try.

3927
02:26:22,110 --> 02:26:22,670
Right.

3928
02:26:25,370 --> 02:26:27,550
I hate Cammy.

3929
02:26:29,910 --> 02:26:30,630
It's cool.

3930
02:26:30,770 --> 02:26:30,990
It's okay.

3931
02:26:31,070 --> 02:26:31,950
They hate Zangief.

3932
02:26:32,450 --> 02:26:33,010
Okay.

3933
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:43,840
Oh, I tried to SPD.

3934
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:44,340
Didn't work.

3935
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:45,860
Nice.

3936
02:26:48,060 --> 02:26:48,380
Nice.

3937
02:26:48,480 --> 02:26:49,020
There you go.

3938
02:26:51,220 --> 02:26:52,420
That's a good button for this match.

3939
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:56,440
Oops.

3940
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:57,400
Oh, it's all right.

3941
02:26:57,540 --> 02:26:58,380
You grappled him.

3942
02:26:58,500 --> 02:26:58,640
It's all right.

3943
02:26:58,640 --> 02:26:59,240
She's burned out.

3944
02:26:59,320 --> 02:26:59,780
No worries.

3945
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:00,400
Oh, no.

3946
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:00,840
You're burned out.

3947
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:01,900
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

3948
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:02,640
Wrong one.

3949
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:03,620
Never mind.

3950
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:06,520
One guy is a buffy wrestler.

3951
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:07,660
That was good for him.

3952
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:08,460
Yeah.

3953
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:09,620
Just don't...

3954
02:27:09,620 --> 02:27:11,840
Be more reserved with your drive meter.

3955
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:14,040
Do like drive rush after SPD to crash medium kick.

3956
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:14,840
He's jumping a lot.

3957
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:15,620
He's holding up back.

3958
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:19,340
Just do the light stuff to keep him pinned down a little bit.

3959
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:21,460
And then do jump MK.

3960
02:27:21,780 --> 02:27:22,600
Keep empty jumping.

3961
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:25,320
He's not gonna DP or jump MK.

3962
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:26,180
And if he does, good shit.

3963
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:26,560
Fuck it.

3964
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:29,680
Yeah, that's good.

3965
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:30,560
Look at his drive meter.

3966
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:32,880
Threaten something.

3967
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:34,780
Oh!

3968
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:35,900
Nice.

3969
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:38,200
Oh, yeah.

3970
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:41,640
Yeah, conserve your drive meter for a little while.

3971
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:43,940
Okay.

3972
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:44,700
Oh, man.

3973
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:45,500
If you knew that...

3974
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:48,040
If you knew the air grab, I've been sick.

3975
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:51,320
It's not the same as pressing triangle.

3976
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:54,040
If only he had a single button.

3977
02:27:58,780 --> 02:27:59,180
Nice.

3978
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:00,840
Oh, nice!

3979
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:02,380
There we go.

3980
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:03,760
All right.

3981
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:06,660
All right.

3982
02:28:06,660 --> 02:28:07,000
All right.

3983
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:07,240
All right.

3984
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:10,260
All right.

3985
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:10,900
All right.

3986
02:28:12,360 --> 02:28:12,880
Strike.

3987
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:25,580
Come on, strike!

3988
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,340
Come on, strike!

3989
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:31,520
Remember, Larry beats all the shenanigans.

3990
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:32,680
Nice.

3991
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:34,080
Nice block.

3992
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:34,920
Nice grab!

3993
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:37,100
That was a big grab, too.

3994
02:28:37,220 --> 02:28:37,600
Let's go.

3995
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:38,800
Oh!

3996
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:40,640
He's mashing.

3997
02:28:42,220 --> 02:28:44,280
Okay, let's not do that.

3998
02:28:44,320 --> 02:28:44,800
That's too much.

3999
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:45,640
Yeah.

4000
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:47,080
Level 3.

4001
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:47,420
Okay.

4002
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:48,800
He's still alive.

4003
02:28:48,820 --> 02:28:49,500
Is that kill?

4004
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:50,480
You're still alive.

4005
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:51,160
No, no.

4006
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:51,640
He's still alive.

4007
02:28:53,160 --> 02:28:54,760
And he's burned out, so...

4008
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:55,500
And he has level 3.

4009
02:28:58,380 --> 02:28:59,160
Nice check.

4010
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:02,980
Oh, that hesitation there.

4011
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:04,100
Yeah.

4012
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:05,160
Oh!

4013
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:07,700
Let's go!

4014
02:29:07,980 --> 02:29:08,840
Oh my god!

4015
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:09,800
Let's go!

4016
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:10,100
Let's go!

4017
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:10,620
Let's go!

4018
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:15,120
Can you try jump MK a little more?

4019
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:16,200
That's the only thing, man.

4020
02:29:16,300 --> 02:29:16,640
Yeah.

4021
02:29:17,940 --> 02:29:18,480
There you go.

4022
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:18,660
Yeah.

4023
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:19,260
There you go.

4024
02:29:19,540 --> 02:29:19,900
Perfect.

4025
02:29:20,820 --> 02:29:21,300
You're cooking.

4026
02:29:21,640 --> 02:29:23,820
I tried a reversal, but he whiffed.

4027
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:24,020
Yeah.

4028
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:24,380
I feel you.

4029
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:25,660
That's annoying.

4030
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:31,320
Nice.

4031
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:33,300
Nice chop.

4032
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:33,500
Nice chop.

4033
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:33,900
Nice chop.

4034
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:35,060
Nice chop.

4035
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:35,140
Nice chop.

4036
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:35,980
Nice chop.

4037
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:36,640
Nice chop.

4038
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:41,440
Nice chop.

4039
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:43,240
He's out nuching now.

4040
02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:45,340
That's fine.

4041
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:46,120
Expensive for him.

4042
02:29:46,260 --> 02:29:46,700
Yeah.

4043
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:48,400
Look how little damage he did there.

4044
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:50,900
Mm!

4045
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:51,500
Mm!

4046
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:52,340
The first chop!

4047
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:52,720
Oh, slap him!

4048
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:53,800
You're out nuching now.

4049
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:54,140
Yep.

4050
02:29:54,220 --> 02:29:54,920
You're playing better.

4051
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:56,860
Get him!

4052
02:29:57,260 --> 02:29:57,740
Yeah!

4053
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:00,000
Oh yeah, baby!

4054
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:01,100
He's mashing!

4055
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:02,560
He's mashing!

4056
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:02,820
He's mashing!

4057
02:30:02,820 --> 02:30:02,920
He's mashing!

4058
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:03,320
Fuck yeah!

4059
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:03,680
Of course!

4060
02:30:08,940 --> 02:30:09,660
Oh yeah.

4061
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:10,740
Get that combo.

4062
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:12,040
That's all good.

4063
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:13,280
Yeah.

4064
02:30:13,380 --> 02:30:14,060
Drop the punish.

4065
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:16,180
Okay.

4066
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:17,420
Oh, I tried to lower again.

4067
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:22,380
Oh yeah.

4068
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:23,360
He be mashing for sure.

4069
02:30:23,640 --> 02:30:24,040
That's so fine.

4070
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:26,480
Oh!

4071
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:30,360
After that spinny kick, she's negative four, so you can jab or medium.

4072
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:31,120
Mm-hmm.

4073
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:31,640
Mm-hmm.

4074
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:32,640
There you go.

4075
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:33,460
Are you winning?

4076
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:34,080
I can't tell.

4077
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:35,440
I got kicked out.

4078
02:30:35,800 --> 02:30:36,840
Oh yeah, baby!

4079
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:38,000
Oh, you got him on the ropes.

4080
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:38,380
Oh no!

4081
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:40,200
I failed to log in.

4082
02:30:41,140 --> 02:30:42,520
I can share screen for you.

4083
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:43,240
Wait.

4084
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:44,740
I haven't even logged in.

4085
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:49,520
I'm restarting my game.

4086
02:30:49,660 --> 02:30:49,800
All right.

4087
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:50,800
Oh, nice anti earlier.

4088
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:52,320
Oh no!

4089
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:53,980
The QSK.

4090
02:30:54,220 --> 02:30:54,940
All right, guys.

4091
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:56,880
Give me a sec.

4092
02:30:57,340 --> 02:30:58,260
There's an update?

4093
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:01,020
Oh, you're alive.

4094
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:01,360
You're alive.

4095
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:01,840
Oh, you got this.

4096
02:31:01,860 --> 02:31:02,160
Nice!

4097
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:02,300
Oh!

4098
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:03,780
So close!

4099
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:04,980
You're playing good.

4100
02:31:05,360 --> 02:31:06,080
You're playing good.

4101
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:07,780
You got this.

4102
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:08,840
Just...

4103
02:31:08,840 --> 02:31:09,200
Yeah.

4104
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:09,860
Okay.

4105
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:10,180
Nice.

4106
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:11,300
What the fuck did he just do?

4107
02:31:11,540 --> 02:31:12,860
Oh, this is dry rush.

4108
02:31:13,140 --> 02:31:13,580
Cancel.

4109
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:14,060
Cancel.

4110
02:31:14,060 --> 02:31:15,060
Oh, nice.

4111
02:31:16,300 --> 02:31:16,700
Nice.

4112
02:31:16,700 --> 02:31:17,500
That was...

4113
02:31:17,500 --> 02:31:17,620
Yeah.

4114
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:18,460
That one on the head?

4115
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:19,820
That's a free drip jab.

4116
02:31:21,980 --> 02:31:22,520
Mm-hmm.

4117
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:23,660
Nice!

4118
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:24,160
Oh, nice!

4119
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:24,800
Headbutt, man.

4120
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:29,300
That's fine.

4121
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:29,640
That's fine.

4122
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:31,600
All right.

4123
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:32,160
I'm back in.

4124
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:34,300
Thank you for letting me swatch.

4125
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:35,640
Nice.

4126
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:35,760
Yeah.

4127
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:35,940
Yeah.

4128
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:36,240
Okay.

4129
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:36,520
Okay.

4130
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:37,160
Nice reversal.

4131
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:40,820
Okay.

4132
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:41,860
Okay.

4133
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:43,320
You got plenty of health.

4134
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:51,480
It's like cool.

4135
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:58,320
Oh, my God.

4136
02:31:58,500 --> 02:31:59,660
Oh, what's going on?

4137
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:00,700
Okay.

4138
02:32:00,700 --> 02:32:01,760
Just get that last poke.

4139
02:32:02,360 --> 02:32:02,820
That's fine.

4140
02:32:03,380 --> 02:32:03,740
Composure.

4141
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:04,500
You can't kill.

4142
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:07,980
Nice.

4143
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:08,660
Nice defense.

4144
02:32:11,320 --> 02:32:11,880
Oh, no.

4145
02:32:11,980 --> 02:32:12,160
Okay.

4146
02:32:12,460 --> 02:32:12,860
It's fine.

4147
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:13,040
It's fine.

4148
02:32:13,060 --> 02:32:13,300
You're alive.

4149
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:13,780
You're good.

4150
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:14,060
You're good.

4151
02:32:14,060 --> 02:32:14,240
You're good.

4152
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:23,020
Oh, God.

4153
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:23,600
Damn it.

4154
02:32:23,620 --> 02:32:23,700
Oh, no.

4155
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:24,560
That was close.

4156
02:32:24,820 --> 02:32:25,960
And these stare downs.

4157
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:27,500
Remember, you got your stand MK.

4158
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:28,460
You got your pokes.

4159
02:32:29,300 --> 02:32:30,780
He's lulling you into that game.

4160
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:31,600
You can use them occasionally.

4161
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:32,220
Okay.

4162
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:34,180
Not always, but just use them occasionally.

4163
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,840
Especially when you got to tap it in.

4164
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:36,520
You got this, brother.

4165
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:37,980
Leave for all pro.

4166
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:38,500
You got this.

4167
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:40,400
Yeah, slap her.

4168
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:41,500
She deserves it.

4169
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:42,340
Oh, the people's chop.

4170
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:43,700
Oh.

4171
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:44,000
Yeah.

4172
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:44,540
She a ho.

4173
02:32:44,740 --> 02:32:45,240
Slap her.

4174
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:46,600
Oh, I didn't say that.

4175
02:32:46,660 --> 02:32:47,020
Okay.

4176
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:52,360
She's just a bad person.

4177
02:32:52,460 --> 02:32:52,740
Yeah.

4178
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:53,320
Yeah.

4179
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:53,700
Yeah.

4180
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:55,000
She's a terrible person.

4181
02:32:55,720 --> 02:32:56,300
Oh, yeah.

4182
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:57,420
Oh, that's okay.

4183
02:32:58,360 --> 02:32:58,720
Nice.

4184
02:32:58,880 --> 02:32:59,180
Nice.

4185
02:32:59,240 --> 02:32:59,820
Nice army.

4186
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:04,860
Best friend.

4187
02:33:04,860 --> 02:33:05,300
The corner.

4188
02:33:05,460 --> 02:33:06,080
Nice predict.

4189
02:33:06,140 --> 02:33:06,820
Oh, my goodness.

4190
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:07,660
Oh, they're freaking out.

4191
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:08,680
Oh, no.

4192
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:09,500
Now you're in the corner.

4193
02:33:13,650 --> 02:33:14,110
Damn it.

4194
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:23,540
Oh.

4195
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:24,560
That's fine.

4196
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:24,980
He's in the corner.

4197
02:33:25,100 --> 02:33:26,060
He's going to try to jump out or something.

4198
02:33:26,340 --> 02:33:26,700
Yeah.

4199
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:27,100
Nice.

4200
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:28,140
Oh, my gosh.

4201
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:28,980
Nice attack.

4202
02:33:29,020 --> 02:33:29,300
Nice.

4203
02:33:29,360 --> 02:33:31,460
You have to drive rush knee or get in there.

4204
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:35,500
You have ways to get in if she's doing too much from way far away.

4205
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:37,900
Nice.

4206
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:39,380
Let's go.

4207
02:33:47,690 --> 02:33:48,370
Oh, yeah.

4208
02:33:48,510 --> 02:33:48,790
Nice.

4209
02:33:49,470 --> 02:33:50,250
That's a good combo.

4210
02:33:50,570 --> 02:33:51,510
I used the drive meter for a little bit.

4211
02:33:53,070 --> 02:33:54,030
But you can walk up.

4212
02:33:54,210 --> 02:33:54,530
Yeah.

4213
02:33:54,530 --> 02:33:55,350
You can still walk at them.

4214
02:33:55,490 --> 02:33:55,830
Yeah.

4215
02:33:55,830 --> 02:33:55,910
Uh-huh.

4216
02:33:56,730 --> 02:33:57,070
Yeah.

4217
02:33:57,810 --> 02:33:58,330
Nice bait.

4218
02:33:58,410 --> 02:33:58,890
Oh, I see.

4219
02:33:58,970 --> 02:33:59,250
I see you.

4220
02:33:59,250 --> 02:33:59,570
I see you.

4221
02:34:01,210 --> 02:34:01,710
You're good.

4222
02:34:01,830 --> 02:34:02,050
You're good.

4223
02:34:04,610 --> 02:34:05,010
Nice.

4224
02:34:05,010 --> 02:34:05,250
Nice.

4225
02:34:06,470 --> 02:34:07,530
I love your fans.

4226
02:34:07,850 --> 02:34:08,190
Yes.

4227
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:08,470
One more.

4228
02:34:08,730 --> 02:34:09,370
Tap it in.

4229
02:34:09,410 --> 02:34:09,750
Yes.

4230
02:34:10,690 --> 02:34:11,210
Let's go.

4231
02:34:11,770 --> 02:34:12,270
Yes, sir.

4232
02:34:13,130 --> 02:34:14,810
The Geef players are undefeated.

4233
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:15,210
This is...

4234
02:34:15,210 --> 02:34:16,070
There's something wrong here.

4235
02:34:16,590 --> 02:34:17,110
Let's go.

4236
02:34:17,230 --> 02:34:17,510
Oh, man.

4237
02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:19,230
Maybe we should have all just been Geef guys.

4238
02:34:19,350 --> 02:34:19,710
Maybe...

4239
02:34:20,990 --> 02:34:21,550
You're right.

4240
02:34:21,650 --> 02:34:22,890
I'm starting to think I should have been Geef.

4241
02:34:22,890 --> 02:34:23,090
Yeah.

4242
02:34:23,090 --> 02:34:24,330
That happens in the future brawl.

4243
02:34:24,330 --> 02:34:24,670
Like...

4244
02:34:24,670 --> 02:34:25,110
Yeah.

4245
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:28,450
When you guys are staring at each other from full screen, Geef just has drive rush knee.

4246
02:34:28,590 --> 02:34:29,670
Like, that's your, like, fuck it.

4247
02:34:29,690 --> 02:34:29,890
Okay.

4248
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:30,350
Okay.

4249
02:34:30,350 --> 02:34:30,570
Okay.

4250
02:34:30,570 --> 02:34:30,830
Yeah.

4251
02:34:30,910 --> 02:34:30,950
Yeah.

4252
02:34:32,070 --> 02:34:34,070
That's the only, like, ham move you're not using when you can.

4253
02:34:34,390 --> 02:34:34,750
Got it.

4254
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:38,470
Like, you're doing a shit ton of drive rush cancels, though, so you're burning yourself out super early.

4255
02:34:38,690 --> 02:34:39,050
Okay.

4256
02:34:39,050 --> 02:34:40,530
So, if you minimize using those and just...

4257
02:34:40,530 --> 02:34:41,030
If you're...

4258
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:45,670
If he's walking back and forth trying to play proper neutral, just say, fuck it, you're going to check my drive rush knee?

4259
02:34:45,970 --> 02:34:46,570
Probably not.

4260
02:34:46,690 --> 02:34:48,710
And if that gets in, you're plussed instantly in their face.

4261
02:34:49,390 --> 02:34:49,750
Okay.

4262
02:34:49,850 --> 02:34:50,270
Got it.

4263
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:51,070
Yeah.

4264
02:34:51,130 --> 02:34:51,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4265
02:34:51,290 --> 02:34:52,150
I will use that more.

4266
02:34:52,310 --> 02:34:52,590
Yeah.

4267
02:34:52,670 --> 02:34:52,890
Yeah.

4268
02:34:53,110 --> 02:34:55,550
It could have been easier, I feel like.

4269
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:56,170
But you...

4270
02:34:56,170 --> 02:34:56,770
Yeah.

4271
02:34:56,990 --> 02:34:57,410
You read him really well.

4272
02:34:57,410 --> 02:34:58,090
That was really difficult.

4273
02:34:58,330 --> 02:34:58,690
Yes.

4274
02:34:58,710 --> 02:34:58,910
Yeah.

4275
02:34:58,990 --> 02:34:59,390
It really was.

4276
02:34:59,610 --> 02:35:06,770
And I actually thought about waking up level three-ing when I died the round before, but I didn't think about it in time.

4277
02:35:06,930 --> 02:35:09,570
It would have worked, too, but yeah.

4278
02:35:09,830 --> 02:35:10,150
Eh.

4279
02:35:11,070 --> 02:35:12,150
That's all guessing, right?

4280
02:35:13,970 --> 02:35:14,370
Yeah.

4281
02:35:14,810 --> 02:35:15,210
Okay.

4282
02:35:15,730 --> 02:35:16,230
Let's go.

4283
02:35:16,690 --> 02:35:17,090
Okay.

4284
02:35:17,190 --> 02:35:17,470
Let's grab.

4285
02:35:20,530 --> 02:35:21,190
Yes, sir.

4286
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:32,880
Oh.

4287
02:35:39,860 --> 02:35:40,260
Nice.

4288
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:40,680
Nice jump out.

4289
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:40,840
Nice.

4290
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:41,080
There you go.

4291
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:41,320
Exactly.

4292
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:42,760
Nice.

4293
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:42,940
There you go.

4294
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:43,040
What the fuck?

4295
02:35:43,880 --> 02:35:44,680
Just nuttiness.

4296
02:35:44,860 --> 02:35:45,460
I don't even know why.

4297
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:46,960
What the fuck was that?

4298
02:35:47,260 --> 02:35:48,020
I didn't...

4299
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:50,460
There you go.

4300
02:35:50,540 --> 02:35:50,900
It was empty.

4301
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:55,840
So just remember, he can modern level one your DI, so you can rush him down normal.

4302
02:35:57,180 --> 02:35:57,580
Yeah.

4303
02:35:57,580 --> 02:35:58,060
Nice throw.

4304
02:35:58,600 --> 02:35:59,000
Nice.

4305
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:00,480
Oh.

4306
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:00,800
No.

4307
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:02,640
Not against modern, yeah.

4308
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:03,360
Yeah.

4309
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:03,860
Yeah.

4310
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:05,980
Modern will just pop that uppercut.

4311
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:07,120
Yeah.

4312
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:08,240
Just throw him over and over.

4313
02:36:11,220 --> 02:36:12,120
There we go.

4314
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:12,740
There we go.

4315
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:13,080
Nice.

4316
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:13,680
Nice combo.

4317
02:36:18,280 --> 02:36:18,760
Yeah.

4318
02:36:18,780 --> 02:36:20,000
That was a good whiff punish by him.

4319
02:36:29,610 --> 02:36:30,090
Nice.

4320
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:30,570
Yeah.

4321
02:36:30,570 --> 02:36:30,770
Nice.

4322
02:36:30,770 --> 02:36:31,050
Pick up.

4323
02:36:41,630 --> 02:36:42,490
Nice grab.

4324
02:36:42,490 --> 02:36:43,150
Oh my gosh.

4325
02:36:43,370 --> 02:36:44,810
What a fucking grab.

4326
02:36:46,730 --> 02:36:47,950
Just think this is Rink.

4327
02:36:48,110 --> 02:36:49,970
That is so...

4328
02:37:00,810 --> 02:37:01,510
Nice drink.

4329
02:37:03,530 --> 02:37:04,930
So he's waiting to...

4330
02:37:04,930 --> 02:37:05,190
Yeah.

4331
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:05,870
He's waiting to react.

4332
02:37:06,130 --> 02:37:06,610
Yeah.

4333
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:10,200
Nice.

4334
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:10,800
Be careful.

4335
02:37:14,170 --> 02:37:14,490
Nice.

4336
02:37:14,790 --> 02:37:15,110
Nice.

4337
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:15,370
Oh.

4338
02:37:15,730 --> 02:37:16,590
Fuck me, man.

4339
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:16,830
Oh.

4340
02:37:16,830 --> 02:37:17,490
That's so close.

4341
02:37:18,250 --> 02:37:18,770
That's so close.

4342
02:37:18,890 --> 02:37:19,190
Yeah.

4343
02:37:19,270 --> 02:37:19,450
Wait a moment.

4344
02:37:20,250 --> 02:37:21,790
Do you ever parry the fireballs?

4345
02:37:21,910 --> 02:37:23,210
You can parry all these fireballs.

4346
02:37:23,590 --> 02:37:23,910
Yeah.

4347
02:37:23,990 --> 02:37:24,470
I should be.

4348
02:37:24,570 --> 02:37:24,810
Yeah.

4349
02:37:24,830 --> 02:37:24,970
Yeah.

4350
02:37:25,050 --> 02:37:25,090
Yeah.

4351
02:37:25,090 --> 02:37:27,190
You should be thinking every time you see that, try to parry it.

4352
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:29,890
And then you can try to drive rush potentially after the fireball.

4353
02:37:31,150 --> 02:37:32,070
And that's your gap.

4354
02:37:32,170 --> 02:37:32,990
Otherwise, you're doing good.

4355
02:37:33,090 --> 02:37:35,470
You know, you can try to jump out of the corner like you're doing.

4356
02:37:36,070 --> 02:37:39,630
But when you're doing offense on him, just keep it super simple.

4357
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:41,350
Don't ever do the jump throw bait, whatever.

4358
02:37:41,350 --> 02:37:46,110
Just throw him or do like drive rush medium or drive rush towards heavy kick.

4359
02:37:46,370 --> 02:37:50,650
Just keep it strike throw because anything with a reaction test, he's going to pass.

4360
02:37:50,990 --> 02:37:51,350
Okay.

4361
02:37:51,430 --> 02:37:51,910
So that's about it.

4362
02:37:52,010 --> 02:37:55,570
Like if he's in that zone fireballing you, just try to parry them.

4363
02:37:55,730 --> 02:38:00,670
And then, yeah, remember to jump out of the corner because you can eat an uppercut when you have enough life and go back to mid-screen.

4364
02:38:01,110 --> 02:38:03,470
He'll drive rush at you after you uppercut him.

4365
02:38:03,610 --> 02:38:06,090
And then he'll try to neutral jump in your face to throw bait you.

4366
02:38:06,210 --> 02:38:08,670
If he throws you mid-screen, let it happen.

4367
02:38:08,850 --> 02:38:09,950
Eat a DP and a throw.

4368
02:38:10,130 --> 02:38:11,330
At that point, you're back to mid-screen.

4369
02:38:11,350 --> 02:38:11,550
Just neutral.

4370
02:38:11,610 --> 02:38:13,030
Just quick rise and you're good.

4371
02:38:13,390 --> 02:38:14,550
It's a nice combo.

4372
02:38:14,830 --> 02:38:15,230
Oh my god.

4373
02:38:15,230 --> 02:38:15,650
Nice combo.

4374
02:38:17,310 --> 02:38:17,590
Meaty.

4375
02:38:18,050 --> 02:38:19,610
Oh, is he dead?

4376
02:38:19,910 --> 02:38:20,830
He's fucking dead.

4377
02:38:21,150 --> 02:38:22,390
Oh my god.

4378
02:38:22,710 --> 02:38:23,090
The adaptation!

4379
02:38:30,010 --> 02:38:30,570
Nice.

4380
02:38:40,190 --> 02:38:40,750
Oh.

4381
02:38:42,410 --> 02:38:43,850
Nice defense, Ko.

4382
02:38:43,950 --> 02:38:44,550
Holy shit.

4383
02:38:44,630 --> 02:38:44,990
Yeah.

4384
02:38:45,170 --> 02:38:45,710
Nice.

4385
02:38:45,710 --> 02:38:45,750
Nice defense, Ko.

4386
02:38:45,750 --> 02:38:45,970
Yeah.

4387
02:38:46,270 --> 02:38:46,830
Yeah.

4388
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,660
Let the drive rush ride.

4389
02:38:58,880 --> 02:38:59,260
Oh!

4390
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:07,140
What is he even saying?

4391
02:39:07,240 --> 02:39:07,700
Head blast?

4392
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:11,420
Uh, what is...

4393
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:11,820
I don't know.

4394
02:39:11,880 --> 02:39:12,100
Sand blast.

4395
02:39:12,100 --> 02:39:13,400
What in the fuck is that even?

4396
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:13,980
Sand blast.

4397
02:39:13,980 --> 02:39:14,340
Don't worry about it.

4398
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:14,840
Let's go, Ko.

4399
02:39:15,640 --> 02:39:17,040
Don't worry about it, Doki.

4400
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:19,000
Sorry.

4401
02:39:22,500 --> 02:39:23,140
We did it!

4402
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:23,640
We did it!

4403
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:23,920
We did it!

4404
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:24,020
We did it!

4405
02:39:24,020 --> 02:39:24,120
Oh!

4406
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:24,680
And now he's burned.

4407
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:25,400
Oh!

4408
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:25,660
Nice!

4409
02:39:25,740 --> 02:39:27,280
Now he's gonna look for level one, but you're good.

4410
02:39:31,780 --> 02:39:32,340
What?

4411
02:39:33,100 --> 02:39:33,660
Block?

4412
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:34,120
Not...

4413
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:34,500
Nice!

4414
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:36,100
Oh my god.

4415
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:36,660
Let's go.

4416
02:39:36,680 --> 02:39:37,480
Let's fucking go!

4417
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:38,960
That was sick.

4418
02:39:39,320 --> 02:39:40,780
Oh, he has like pocket sand.

4419
02:39:40,780 --> 02:39:41,800
That's my last blue player right there.

4420
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:45,400
He's showing his pocket sand at you.

4421
02:39:58,440 --> 02:39:59,560
Nice blocks.

4422
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:04,860
Oh, nice grab!

4423
02:40:05,380 --> 02:40:06,000
All right.

4424
02:40:06,020 --> 02:40:06,040
Nice grab.

4425
02:40:06,060 --> 02:40:07,760
Just watch your drive meter and you should be okay.

4426
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:13,520
Nice!

4427
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:14,460
Excellent jump.

4428
02:40:15,180 --> 02:40:15,200
Nice.

4429
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:15,600
Push.

4430
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:18,680
Oh, he doesn't know what to do!

4431
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:18,980
Oh.

4432
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:19,400
Sequence.

4433
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:21,500
Oh!

4434
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:23,020
Yes, sir.

4435
02:40:23,100 --> 02:40:23,200
Oh my god.

4436
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:23,740
Holy shit!

4437
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:24,920
What the fuck am I watching?

4438
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:26,380
That's fine.

4439
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:26,720
That's fine.

4440
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:28,360
Good defense.

4441
02:40:30,040 --> 02:40:30,440
Yes!

4442
02:40:30,460 --> 02:40:31,280
Drive rush meter!

4443
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:32,280
Yes, sir!

4444
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:34,000
That's what I'm talking about.

4445
02:40:34,240 --> 02:40:34,680
Let's go, Ko.

4446
02:40:34,780 --> 02:40:36,400
Is my poison kicking in?

4447
02:40:36,780 --> 02:40:37,180
Damn.

4448
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:38,220
One, two, three!

4449
02:40:38,660 --> 02:40:38,920
One, two, three!

4450
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:39,040
One, two, three!

4451
02:40:44,730 --> 02:40:45,170
Jeez.

4452
02:40:45,510 --> 02:40:46,470
What the fuck?

4453
02:40:47,110 --> 02:40:47,770
Oh, nice.

4454
02:40:47,990 --> 02:40:48,290
Yeah.

4455
02:40:48,530 --> 02:40:50,150
Boxbox plays like a gorilla, man.

4456
02:40:50,910 --> 02:40:51,350
Yeah.

4457
02:40:51,630 --> 02:40:52,990
Thank god he's on modern.

4458
02:40:53,090 --> 02:40:53,970
That did barely anything.

4459
02:40:55,630 --> 02:40:56,070
Yeah.

4460
02:40:57,650 --> 02:40:58,090
Yeah.

4461
02:40:58,110 --> 02:40:59,910
Last season, that would have done so much more, too.

4462
02:41:00,910 --> 02:41:01,670
Nice punish!

4463
02:41:01,910 --> 02:41:02,310
Nice.

4464
02:41:04,850 --> 02:41:05,290
Nice.

4465
02:41:05,470 --> 02:41:05,910
Oh!

4466
02:41:06,050 --> 02:41:06,490
Oh!

4467
02:41:06,490 --> 02:41:06,850
Oh!

4468
02:41:06,850 --> 02:41:07,050
Nice.

4469
02:41:07,050 --> 02:41:07,470
Okay.

4470
02:41:07,510 --> 02:41:08,390
Oh my god!

4471
02:41:08,390 --> 02:41:09,630
The first level three!

4472
02:41:09,950 --> 02:41:10,690
What the dang!

4473
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:11,690
I love this character.

4474
02:41:11,710 --> 02:41:11,950
Let's go!

4475
02:41:11,970 --> 02:41:12,130
I love this character, man.

4476
02:41:12,790 --> 02:41:13,670
Because of this.

4477
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:18,240
Oh!

4478
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:18,920
Just blocked?

4479
02:41:20,040 --> 02:41:20,440
Oh!

4480
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:20,920
Nice!

4481
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:22,100
Oh, yeah!

4482
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:23,180
Let's go!

4483
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:24,060
Let's go!

4484
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:24,640
Let's go!

4485
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:26,040
Nice and easy.

4486
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:27,960
Patience.

4487
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:28,600
Let's go, man.

4488
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:30,020
Oh, technically, you won the set.

4489
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:30,840
Let's go, man.

4490
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:30,860
We did it!

4491
02:41:30,860 --> 02:41:33,420
And, coach, you wouldn't have had to play, either.

4492
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:33,680
Yeah, you won the play!

4493
02:41:34,180 --> 02:41:34,720
Thank you.

4494
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,000
Oh, really?

4495
02:41:35,220 --> 02:41:35,680
Thank you.

4496
02:41:36,100 --> 02:41:37,180
If this was Sunday, we wouldn't have to play.

4497
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:37,420
Hell yeah!

4498
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:38,640
Yeah, it was the 3-0.

4499
02:41:38,700 --> 02:41:39,400
Yeah, 3-1.

4500
02:41:39,580 --> 02:41:39,740
Thank you, guys.

4501
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:43,200
But we do need him to play for the points, though.

4502
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:43,600
That's all right.

4503
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:44,420
Yeah.

4504
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:44,640
Yeah.

4505
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:45,720
We need you to play.

4506
02:41:45,800 --> 02:41:46,700
I guess I'll try.

4507
02:41:47,140 --> 02:41:47,860
I guess.

4508
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:52,460
I like how Kolo always forgets to leave the thing.

4509
02:41:53,060 --> 02:41:55,500
He forgets to leave the lobby every time.

4510
02:41:56,940 --> 02:41:57,860
He's still forgetting.

4511
02:41:57,960 --> 02:41:58,080
Oh!

4512
02:41:58,180 --> 02:42:00,060
I definitely got lucky with those, like, jump-ins.

4513
02:42:00,060 --> 02:42:01,620
Oh, he still doesn't realize.

4514
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:02,360
Oh!

4515
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:03,200
Fuck me!

4516
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:03,740
Sorry!

4517
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:04,220
Sorry!

4518
02:42:04,260 --> 02:42:04,500
Sorry!

4519
02:42:04,540 --> 02:42:04,980
I'm so sorry.

4520
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:05,300
Okay.

4521
02:42:05,780 --> 02:42:07,420
Now we can revel in the victory.

4522
02:42:07,900 --> 02:42:10,980
Now you can start talking about it.

4523
02:42:11,240 --> 02:42:11,260
Yeah.

4524
02:42:12,820 --> 02:42:13,260
Woo!

4525
02:42:14,820 --> 02:42:16,720
I've been chugging water to fight the nerves.

4526
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:17,220
What the hell?

4527
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:17,960
Hold on a minute.

4528
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:18,420
I gotta...

4529
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:19,320
Did he pick the wrong character?

4530
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:20,400
Wait.

4531
02:42:20,420 --> 02:42:20,620
He's...

4532
02:42:20,620 --> 02:42:20,800
Okay.

4533
02:42:20,820 --> 02:42:21,240
There we go.

4534
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:21,680
Oh.

4535
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:22,200
Sorry.

4536
02:42:22,280 --> 02:42:22,620
There we go.

4537
02:42:22,660 --> 02:42:22,860
What?

4538
02:42:23,020 --> 02:42:23,080
Oh, yeah.

4539
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:23,780
I was gonna be like, what?

4540
02:42:23,780 --> 02:42:25,400
Did we pick the wrong coach, though?

4541
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:28,320
I was like, oh, shit.

4542
02:42:28,460 --> 02:42:32,120
All right.

4543
02:42:32,140 --> 02:42:33,140
I'm stalling a little bit.

4544
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:35,500
All right.

4545
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:38,520
I'm gonna get some water while I'm...

4546
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:39,640
I gotta pee, bro.

4547
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:41,200
But I gotta watch this, too, though.

4548
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:43,060
I'm telling you, bro.

4549
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:43,420
Bro.

4550
02:42:43,420 --> 02:42:43,540
I'm gonna pee.

4551
02:42:43,540 --> 02:42:44,000
Don't for Roy.

4552
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:45,440
Save the piss puff for Roy.

4553
02:42:46,180 --> 02:42:47,680
Dude, that doesn't work.

4554
02:42:48,220 --> 02:42:49,860
It works.

4555
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:50,520
I promise.

4556
02:43:04,820 --> 02:43:05,420
Yippee!

4557
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:17,520
Nice.

4558
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:19,760
Stand still.

4559
02:43:22,540 --> 02:43:23,600
Oh my.

4560
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:26,980
Nice block.

4561
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,220
Oh my.

4562
02:43:28,220 --> 02:43:28,360
The flush.

4563
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:28,380
Oh my.

4564
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:28,720
Nice one in.

4565
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:29,480
Oookay.

4566
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:30,540
Oh my.

4567
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:32,780
Oh!

4568
02:43:32,780 --> 02:43:34,100
The counter grab.

4569
02:43:40,100 --> 02:43:41,340
Holy cuck.

4570
02:43:41,360 --> 02:43:43,300
Oh, she doesn't need the meter!

4571
02:43:56,760 --> 02:43:58,320
Oh, send that back.

4572
02:44:00,260 --> 02:44:01,840
That's really Dragon Ball Z.

4573
02:44:01,960 --> 02:44:03,000
Yeah, it is!

4574
02:44:06,700 --> 02:44:08,200
Yeah, stand the fuck still.

4575
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:22,360
Oh, nice!

4576
02:44:22,860 --> 02:44:23,940
Oh my gosh.

4577
02:44:23,960 --> 02:44:24,880
Nice, Perfect Parry!

4578
02:44:25,420 --> 02:44:26,260
Ball time!

4579
02:44:30,320 --> 02:44:32,180
That combo is so sick.

4580
02:44:32,220 --> 02:44:32,640
It looks so cool.

4581
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:34,200
That's like the sickest combo in the game.

4582
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:38,260
I wish it does more damage.

4583
02:44:38,820 --> 02:44:39,860
Oh my god, Brian!

4584
02:44:41,480 --> 02:44:42,240
Let's go, Brian!

4585
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:42,980
The coach is locked in.

4586
02:44:43,300 --> 02:44:43,900
Let's go.

4587
02:44:44,180 --> 02:44:45,520
Oh my god.

4588
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:46,140
Yeah!

4589
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:47,000
Oh my lord.

4590
02:44:47,080 --> 02:44:48,640
Holy shit.

4591
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:51,540
He is hella locked in because he knows it's fine.

4592
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:51,800
He has a variety.

4593
02:44:51,820 --> 02:44:52,780
He has a weekend ahead of him.

4594
02:44:52,860 --> 02:44:54,320
He doesn't have to worry about work tomorrow.

4595
02:44:55,060 --> 02:44:56,900
He doesn't have to worry about the 9-5.

4596
02:44:57,840 --> 02:44:58,280
Yeah.

4597
02:45:01,980 --> 02:45:04,100
Another Perfect Parry?!

4598
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:14,560
He doesn't have meter though.

4599
02:45:20,480 --> 02:45:21,460
Where are we at, team?

4600
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:23,260
Brian's cooking.

4601
02:45:23,980 --> 02:45:24,940
Brian's gonna set.

4602
02:45:25,400 --> 02:45:25,840
Brian's cooking.

4603
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:26,820
That's one more round.

4604
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:27,260
Brian's cooking.

4605
02:45:27,260 --> 02:45:27,260
Let's go.

4606
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:29,300
Oh my gosh.

4607
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:29,300
Oh my gosh.

4608
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:30,300
Oh, let's go.

4609
02:45:30,500 --> 02:45:31,340
That's fucking awesome.

4610
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:31,740
Oh, that's free.

4611
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:32,940
Yeah, yeah.

4612
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:34,640
That's the only thing he could do.

4613
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:36,380
It's level 1, right?

4614
02:45:36,860 --> 02:45:37,900
Yeah, it's level 1.

4615
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:39,020
Okay, so...

4616
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:43,420
Oh yeah, he just barely got it back.

4617
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:43,960
Yeah.

4618
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:46,800
That was a good timing.

4619
02:45:47,560 --> 02:45:48,060
Just barely.

4620
02:45:48,060 --> 02:45:49,280
The frame, it came back.

4621
02:45:49,880 --> 02:45:50,380
Yeah.

4622
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:55,840
This guy's been watching coefficient.

4623
02:45:57,700 --> 02:45:59,780
The coach is watching coefficient.

4624
02:46:01,740 --> 02:46:02,740
He's been taking notes.

4625
02:46:08,430 --> 02:46:09,210
Well, that was good.

4626
02:46:09,730 --> 02:46:10,470
That was, yeah.

4627
02:46:13,770 --> 02:46:14,970
Oh, he met... Oh, I know.

4628
02:46:14,990 --> 02:46:15,730
He did a frame kill.

4629
02:46:16,110 --> 02:46:16,910
Oh, nice jump.

4630
02:46:17,130 --> 02:46:17,690
Nice jump.

4631
02:46:18,050 --> 02:46:18,290
Oh my gosh.

4632
02:46:18,890 --> 02:46:19,930
Oh, ball time!

4633
02:46:21,130 --> 02:46:22,070
I love that move.

4634
02:46:22,070 --> 02:46:22,530
Here we go.

4635
02:46:22,690 --> 02:46:23,050
Time for ball.

4636
02:46:23,050 --> 02:46:23,650
Oh, the desync.

4637
02:46:23,650 --> 02:46:24,150
Here we go.

4638
02:46:24,590 --> 02:46:25,710
On both sides.

4639
02:46:25,970 --> 02:46:26,530
Oh, okay.

4640
02:46:26,830 --> 02:46:29,590
Yeah, that was... Yeah, he messed up a little bit, but it's okay.

4641
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:31,110
Yeah, but he got confused.

4642
02:46:33,470 --> 02:46:34,710
Oh, nice jab.

4643
02:46:35,110 --> 02:46:35,690
Oh my gosh.

4644
02:46:36,010 --> 02:46:36,930
Not gonna kill.

4645
02:46:36,990 --> 02:46:37,670
We're gonna keep going.

4646
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:41,630
Oh.

4647
02:46:42,110 --> 02:46:43,250
Nice jump out, though.

4648
02:46:43,310 --> 02:46:43,690
Yeah.

4649
02:46:43,690 --> 02:46:44,410
Oh, they're burnt out.

4650
02:46:46,950 --> 02:46:48,090
Gotta be careful here.

4651
02:46:51,130 --> 02:46:52,310
Oh, nice flicker.

4652
02:46:53,030 --> 02:46:54,350
Oh, ball time.

4653
02:46:54,570 --> 02:46:56,150
Oh, you have to deal with it.

4654
02:46:56,190 --> 02:46:57,390
You have to deal with it now.

4655
02:46:57,470 --> 02:46:57,690
Yeah.

4656
02:46:58,770 --> 02:47:00,550
No, that ball when you're burnt out.

4657
02:47:00,730 --> 02:47:01,350
Nah, dude.

4658
02:47:01,370 --> 02:47:02,550
Yeah, it's just impossible.

4659
02:47:02,550 --> 02:47:03,550
Impossible for him.

4660
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:09,980
Oh, nice.

4661
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:10,880
Okay, that was tricky.

4662
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:14,000
Yeah, no, she's a little freaky.

4663
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:20,240
Okay.

4664
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:23,720
Nice jump out.

4665
02:47:23,740 --> 02:47:24,040
Nice.

4666
02:47:24,060 --> 02:47:24,200
Let's go.

4667
02:47:24,320 --> 02:47:25,200
Taking his own advice.

4668
02:47:25,340 --> 02:47:25,700
Let's go.

4669
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:27,100
Oh, yeah.

4670
02:47:27,180 --> 02:47:28,000
Aki has that.

4671
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:30,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4672
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:32,940
Safe jumps.

4673
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:33,300
Good.

4674
02:47:36,140 --> 02:47:36,580
That was good.

4675
02:47:36,740 --> 02:47:37,360
Come here.

4676
02:47:37,420 --> 02:47:38,080
Get over here.

4677
02:47:39,640 --> 02:47:40,620
Oh, it's the blitz.

4678
02:47:40,660 --> 02:47:41,920
You get a combo off of that.

4679
02:47:43,300 --> 02:47:44,280
Oh, nice jump.

4680
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:44,460
Oh, my God.

4681
02:47:44,780 --> 02:47:45,360
He's desperate.

4682
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:46,680
He's desperate.

4683
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:47,920
It's okay.

4684
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:49,240
Composure.

4685
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:51,680
Nice tech.

4686
02:47:52,900 --> 02:47:53,800
Oh, she doesn't have it.

4687
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:53,840
Oh, they're burnt out.

4688
02:47:53,980 --> 02:47:54,160
Let's go.

4689
02:47:56,980 --> 02:47:58,860
Yeah, good reactions.

4690
02:47:59,100 --> 02:47:59,880
Sounds good.

4691
02:47:59,920 --> 02:48:00,100
Yeah.

4692
02:48:00,100 --> 02:48:01,500
No, Diafone's reactions are insane.

4693
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:04,220
All right.

4694
02:48:04,440 --> 02:48:04,800
Composure.

4695
02:48:04,820 --> 02:48:05,180
No worries.

4696
02:48:05,980 --> 02:48:06,740
They'll burnt out.

4697
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:11,860
Oh, time to throw this out.

4698
02:48:12,020 --> 02:48:12,320
We're seeing it again.

4699
02:48:13,020 --> 02:48:13,740
Time to throw.

4700
02:48:13,900 --> 02:48:15,020
You got to deal with this ball now.

4701
02:48:15,900 --> 02:48:16,260
Yup.

4702
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:16,600
Yup.

4703
02:48:16,660 --> 02:48:16,760
Yup.

4704
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:19,540
Oh, yeah.

4705
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:20,620
That was crazy.

4706
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:22,540
That guy is crazy.

4707
02:48:22,980 --> 02:48:23,900
Let's go, dude.

4708
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:24,960
How did you know?

4709
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:25,720
That was so good.

4710
02:48:25,960 --> 02:48:26,320
That was sick.

4711
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:26,660
Nah, dude.

4712
02:48:26,700 --> 02:48:27,400
You got to tell me.

4713
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:28,000
How did you know?

4714
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:29,380
Did you know he was going to do that?

4715
02:48:29,380 --> 02:48:29,780
That was insane.

4716
02:48:29,780 --> 02:48:30,180
Nah, I didn't.

4717
02:48:30,260 --> 02:48:31,460
I just knew he was in a bad spot.

4718
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:32,800
Oh, cool.

4719
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:33,860
Hey, all right.

4720
02:48:34,220 --> 02:48:34,280
Good job.

4721
02:48:34,280 --> 02:48:34,400
That was crazy.

4722
02:48:34,400 --> 02:48:34,900
He does that.

4723
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:35,520
He gets fucked.

4724
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:36,580
He doesn't block low.

4725
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:38,680
It's a high-low mix and beats drive reversal.

4726
02:48:39,300 --> 02:48:40,960
That was insane.

4727
02:48:42,060 --> 02:48:44,120
Dude, the checkmate was awesome.

4728
02:48:44,260 --> 02:48:44,700
Yeah.

4729
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:45,660
Good stuff.

4730
02:48:46,060 --> 02:48:47,540
That was incredible, bro.

4731
02:48:47,620 --> 02:48:50,000
I love watching all your sets so far, dude.

4732
02:48:50,580 --> 02:48:51,720
They're so good, dude.

4733
02:48:51,720 --> 02:48:53,420
Yeah, they're all intense as hell.

4734
02:48:53,420 --> 02:48:55,160
This might as well be Sunday.

4735
02:48:55,800 --> 02:48:56,640
Oh, come on.

4736
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:57,960
I wish it was, dude.

4737
02:48:58,040 --> 02:48:58,820
Mr. Jam Man.

4738
02:48:58,840 --> 02:48:59,180
Please.

4739
02:48:59,220 --> 02:48:59,360
Please.

4740
02:48:59,380 --> 02:49:00,380
Just let this be Sunday.

4741
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,100
Yeah, let's just...

4742
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:03,080
Let's just let this be Sunday.

4743
02:49:03,380 --> 02:49:05,780
The teams with the most points go to the finals.

4744
02:49:05,940 --> 02:49:07,160
Go to the TwitchCon.

4745
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:08,520
They just win.

4746
02:49:08,540 --> 02:49:09,740
The team with the most...

4747
02:49:09,740 --> 02:49:10,920
The team with the most points.

4748
02:49:11,020 --> 02:49:12,200
Yeah, but that'd be Nephew.

4749
02:49:12,200 --> 02:49:12,660
What do you mean?

4750
02:49:16,040 --> 02:49:16,840
Oh, damn.

4751
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:19,720
Coach, you just gave my chat a huge payout, apparently.

4752
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:21,080
Yeah, fuck you guys, chat.

4753
02:49:22,040 --> 02:49:23,860
How do you not believe in my coach, huh?

4754
02:49:24,280 --> 02:49:25,240
How could they?

4755
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:27,420
How could they do that?

4756
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:28,520
I know, right?

4757
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:29,360
I beat Dynaphone last time, too.

4758
02:49:29,360 --> 02:49:30,720
Yeah, exactly.

4759
02:49:31,100 --> 02:49:31,720
Yeah, exactly.

4760
02:49:32,820 --> 02:49:34,040
They're just hating, man.

4761
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:34,220
No, dude.

4762
02:49:34,220 --> 02:49:34,460
Don't worry.

4763
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:35,700
I'm going to give them a nice scolding.

4764
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:35,920
They're haters.

4765
02:49:37,780 --> 02:49:39,820
Chat, you and I are going to have a talk after this, all right?

4766
02:49:45,410 --> 02:49:46,130
All right.

4767
02:49:46,530 --> 02:49:47,230
Bathroom break again.

4768
02:49:47,430 --> 02:49:47,970
All right.

4769
02:49:48,110 --> 02:49:48,730
Bathroom break.

4770
02:49:49,110 --> 02:49:49,710
Bathroom break.

4771
02:49:50,290 --> 02:49:51,290
Oh, I need hot water.

4772
02:49:51,890 --> 02:49:52,250
Break time.

4773
02:49:52,250 --> 02:49:52,790
Break time.

4774
02:49:52,970 --> 02:49:54,290
To the last match here.

4775
02:49:54,470 --> 02:49:54,550
Yeah.

4776
02:49:54,550 --> 02:49:56,450
So, we played the same team last year.

4777
02:49:57,390 --> 02:49:57,750
Automatic.

4778
02:49:58,730 --> 02:49:59,090
Automatic.

4779
02:49:59,090 --> 02:49:59,450
Okay, cool.

4780
02:49:59,450 --> 02:49:59,550
Last year.

4781
02:49:59,550 --> 02:50:00,650
Last year.

4782
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:00,990
Last year.

4783
02:50:01,190 --> 02:50:01,430
Last year.

4784
02:50:02,210 --> 02:50:03,010
Last year.

4785
02:50:03,010 --> 02:50:04,090
Do you guys don't remember?

4786
02:50:04,490 --> 02:50:05,510
See, this is what I mean.

4787
02:50:05,550 --> 02:50:07,190
I can't speak when playing.

4788
02:50:07,950 --> 02:50:08,870
Last year.

4789
02:50:09,150 --> 02:50:10,610
I start losing motor function.

4790
02:50:13,310 --> 02:50:13,770
Yeah.

4791
02:50:13,970 --> 02:50:16,110
The games are still going on for other people.

4792
02:50:17,130 --> 02:50:18,630
ShinySea might have another 5-0.

4793
02:50:19,350 --> 02:50:21,690
They currently have 1-5-0 right now.

4794
02:50:22,610 --> 02:50:23,290
Oh, really?

4795
02:50:23,570 --> 02:50:23,770
Yeah.

4796
02:50:24,050 --> 02:50:27,090
And their other matchup is 4-0 at the moment.

4797
02:50:28,210 --> 02:50:28,670
Man.

4798
02:50:28,670 --> 02:50:28,930
Oh, man.

4799
02:50:28,970 --> 02:50:29,410
So, they're...

4800
02:50:29,410 --> 02:50:29,530
Oh, man.

4801
02:50:29,530 --> 02:50:30,590
It's a coach's match.

4802
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:35,460
All right.

4803
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:40,700
What is Shine's...

4804
02:50:42,980 --> 02:50:45,320
We almost did a 5-0.

4805
02:50:45,500 --> 02:50:46,060
Almost.

4806
02:50:46,260 --> 02:50:47,080
It is close.

4807
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:48,280
Yeah.

4808
02:50:48,280 --> 02:50:49,520
We haven't lost a single leg set, technically.

4809
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:51,460
I think we're the best performing team today.

4810
02:50:52,420 --> 02:50:53,260
I agree.

4811
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:54,480
100%.

4812
02:50:55,620 --> 02:50:59,120
So, we're in the leading points overall right now.

4813
02:50:59,120 --> 02:50:59,220
Best performing?

4814
02:50:59,860 --> 02:51:00,660
I don't know.

4815
02:51:00,660 --> 02:51:02,940
Because Shine is on, like, a crazy streak.

4816
02:51:02,940 --> 02:51:02,960
Yeah.

4817
02:51:02,960 --> 02:51:03,460
Shine is on, like...

4818
02:51:03,460 --> 02:51:03,780
Like a 9-0.

4819
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:04,700
9-0 streak right now.

4820
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:04,980
Team Shine.

4821
02:51:04,980 --> 02:51:05,940
They have a 5-0.

4822
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:07,720
Wait.

4823
02:51:07,780 --> 02:51:08,080
I think they...

4824
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:09,380
I think they had another 5-0.

4825
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:11,900
So, they're about to do a 5-0.

4826
02:51:11,980 --> 02:51:12,180
No.

4827
02:51:12,200 --> 02:51:14,020
They just got the 5-B.

4828
02:51:14,140 --> 02:51:14,440
Oh.

4829
02:51:14,460 --> 02:51:14,700
They did.

4830
02:51:14,860 --> 02:51:15,520
They just got...

4831
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:16,640
They got two 5-0s.

4832
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:18,320
That's crazy.

4833
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:19,500
Yeah.

4834
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:21,160
Us and Shine's team are doing the best today.

4835
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:21,880
Yeah.

4836
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:23,700
But we beat them overall.

4837
02:51:23,880 --> 02:51:24,180
Right?

4838
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:25,480
So, that's good for us.

4839
02:51:25,480 --> 02:51:25,620
Yeah.

4840
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:26,200
We did beat them overall.

4841
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:28,320
We gate-hipped them from some points.

4842
02:51:28,780 --> 02:51:29,300
Let's go!

4843
02:51:31,460 --> 02:51:32,240
All that matters.

4844
02:51:33,280 --> 02:51:33,640
Let's go!

4845
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:33,760
Let's go!

4846
02:51:34,520 --> 02:51:35,440
I think we...

4847
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:36,400
There's a potential...

4848
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:36,520
Yeah.

4849
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:36,640
Shine is doing a lot.

4850
02:51:36,660 --> 02:51:44,440
We could get second if we do well in the next set because Nepia's team isn't doing so hot this round...

4851
02:51:44,440 --> 02:51:45,000
This...

4852
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:45,200
Today.

4853
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:48,620
Right now, we're in the lead in points overall.

4854
02:51:48,860 --> 02:51:53,300
As of right now in the score sheet, for day one and two, we are in first place right now.

4855
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:53,760
Oh, nice!

4856
02:51:53,840 --> 02:51:54,380
Hell yeah, dude.

4857
02:51:54,580 --> 02:51:56,560
I don't know if it has to update a bunch.

4858
02:51:56,660 --> 02:51:57,540
It's kind of hard to read.

4859
02:51:57,620 --> 02:52:02,040
I think Shine and JB's team hasn't updated yet.

4860
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:03,200
Yeah.

4861
02:52:03,780 --> 02:52:07,580
So, it's going to be like a race between us, Shine's team, and Nepia's team.

4862
02:52:07,640 --> 02:52:07,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4863
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:09,400
There's a clear division right now.

4864
02:52:10,460 --> 02:52:11,360
We're pulling ahead.

4865
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:12,440
Like, us three.

4866
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:14,020
So, I think we're...

4867
02:52:14,020 --> 02:52:14,160
That'd be sick.

4868
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:17,320
Like, let's clean it up, but we're looking really good for winners.

4869
02:52:17,960 --> 02:52:18,400
Oh, it just updated it.

4870
02:52:19,500 --> 02:52:20,540
Did it just update?

4871
02:52:22,380 --> 02:52:23,260
Who's Automatic?

4872
02:52:23,260 --> 02:52:23,680
That's right.

4873
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:25,100
Who's Team Automatic?

4874
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:25,880
Oh, the DJ.

4875
02:52:26,780 --> 02:52:27,220
ASNW.

4876
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:27,540
Okay.

4877
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:30,320
Oh, we're tied at 109 with Shine.

4878
02:52:31,480 --> 02:52:31,920
Yeah.

4879
02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:33,520
So, Automatic is...

4880
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:33,620
Yeah, but overall...

4881
02:52:33,620 --> 02:52:33,760
Yeah, but overall...

4882
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:37,460
I feel like there's a clear divide, like us, Shine, and Nephew.

4883
02:52:38,820 --> 02:52:39,340
So...

4884
02:52:39,340 --> 02:52:39,700
Okay.

4885
02:52:40,760 --> 02:52:41,280
Okay.

4886
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:41,560
Cool.

4887
02:52:42,900 --> 02:52:44,240
Let's just close out strong.

4888
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:44,560
Whee!

4889
02:52:52,500 --> 02:52:53,020
Oh,

4890
02:52:56,340 --> 02:52:56,640
SK.

4891
02:52:56,820 --> 02:52:58,120
So, you're Ken.

4892
02:52:58,320 --> 02:52:58,360
Yeah.

4893
02:52:58,380 --> 02:53:00,400
I think you fight another Ken now.

4894
02:53:00,560 --> 02:53:03,080
And the thing is, they do a lot of the same thing.

4895
02:53:03,220 --> 02:53:03,740
Okay.

4896
02:53:03,740 --> 02:53:05,620
Minus the Dragon Lash.

4897
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:06,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

4898
02:53:06,260 --> 02:53:09,120
They do the same idea of like the medium punch, heavy punch, and DI.

4899
02:53:10,820 --> 02:53:12,940
Oh, Shine and Nephew face each other last.

4900
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:17,840
So, if Nephew loses against Shine, then we do really well in our matches.

4901
02:53:17,940 --> 02:53:19,220
We can get second or first.

4902
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:20,760
Okay.

4903
02:53:20,760 --> 02:53:21,000
Yeah.

4904
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,040
I mean, we're good for winners is what I think.

4905
02:53:23,140 --> 02:53:23,420
Right?

4906
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:24,200
I think we're just...

4907
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:25,200
It's only bottom two go to losers.

4908
02:53:25,340 --> 02:53:25,540
Right?

4909
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:26,440
We just want to be top four.

4910
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:27,240
Yeah.

4911
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:28,980
So, let's just close out strong.

4912
02:53:29,180 --> 02:53:30,420
And we should be set.

4913
02:53:30,900 --> 02:53:31,260
Yeah.

4914
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:32,160
Should be good.

4915
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:32,380
Yeah.

4916
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:34,580
SK, the same idea with...

4917
02:53:34,580 --> 02:53:35,800
I think they're going to be weaker.

4918
02:53:35,800 --> 02:53:42,820
They're not going to be as good at doing DP and Dragon Lash, but they're going to do medium punch, heavy punch, and then they're going to do DI.

4919
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:48,920
So, if you can press medium punch there in return and DI back in the rest of your regular game plan, it should be fine.

4920
02:53:49,220 --> 02:53:50,360
But they also do...

4921
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:50,480
Does Seratina jump?

4922
02:53:52,040 --> 02:53:52,400
Seratina?

4923
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:53,220
That's your question?

4924
02:53:53,220 --> 02:53:53,540
The Eki.

4925
02:53:53,760 --> 02:53:54,340
Yeah, yeah.

4926
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:55,740
Does she jump?

4927
02:53:55,820 --> 02:53:56,340
I don't remember.

4928
02:53:56,780 --> 02:53:56,800
They do...

4929
02:53:56,800 --> 02:53:58,720
She waits for your DI in the corner.

4930
02:53:58,880 --> 02:53:59,220
That's what I...

4931
02:53:59,220 --> 02:53:59,600
Oh, yeah.

4932
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:00,620
She does the counter DI.

4933
02:54:00,720 --> 02:54:01,080
Okay.

4934
02:54:01,320 --> 02:54:02,540
So, as long as I don't DI.

4935
02:54:02,740 --> 02:54:03,100
Yeah.

4936
02:54:03,640 --> 02:54:05,120
So, just don't use DI against her.

4937
02:54:05,880 --> 02:54:11,980
Just walk up to her and press triangle or do like jump X and get in.

4938
02:54:12,160 --> 02:54:16,160
You know, she's waiting for you to DI, so that lets you do your other moves like your jumps.

4939
02:54:16,780 --> 02:54:17,180
Okay.

4940
02:54:17,180 --> 02:54:19,440
So, we're currently tied with Shyvana now.

4941
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:19,820
Yeah, yeah.

4942
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:24,680
But they're facing Nephew, so like no matter what, like Nephew's going to...

4943
02:54:24,680 --> 02:54:24,960
Oh, okay.

4944
02:54:25,080 --> 02:54:25,860
So, they have a tough one.

4945
02:54:25,860 --> 02:54:26,880
One of them are going to drop points.

4946
02:54:26,940 --> 02:54:27,600
Either of them.

4947
02:54:27,640 --> 02:54:27,960
Yeah, yeah.

4948
02:54:28,320 --> 02:54:28,920
Which is...

4949
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:29,460
Oh, that's...

4950
02:54:29,460 --> 02:54:30,040
Oh, man.

4951
02:54:30,300 --> 02:54:31,080
Oh, boy.

4952
02:54:31,280 --> 02:54:35,520
So, we just have to do well on this set and we're guaranteed second or first.

4953
02:54:36,780 --> 02:54:39,940
No guarantees, but we're going to kill this.

4954
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:40,780
Let's do this.

4955
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:41,180
Yippee.

4956
02:54:42,540 --> 02:54:43,160
Let's go.

4957
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:45,440
Let's go.

4958
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:46,840
Actually, what's their challenge?

4959
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:49,140
I love that our training is showing results.

4960
02:54:50,460 --> 02:54:50,900
Yeah.

4961
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:51,640
You guys put in work.

4962
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:52,160
It really has.

4963
02:54:52,920 --> 02:54:53,860
I beat those.

4964
02:54:53,980 --> 02:54:55,000
I beat those two that beat me.

4965
02:54:55,160 --> 02:54:59,500
I think fighting viewers was more productive than doing rank, what I've learned.

4966
02:54:59,620 --> 02:55:03,360
Because then I can like figure out the matchups much easier because I kick anybody else...

4967
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:05,500
I kick anybody that's not playing the character.

4968
02:55:05,500 --> 02:55:06,500
I'm playing against.

4969
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:08,620
And you also play more than one game.

4970
02:55:09,080 --> 02:55:09,560
Yeah.

4971
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:10,740
Yeah.

4972
02:55:10,820 --> 02:55:11,280
See.

4973
02:55:11,280 --> 02:55:12,320
Because I'm not losing either.

4974
02:55:12,380 --> 02:55:13,300
There's something to it.

4975
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:13,380
And I don't care.

4976
02:55:15,300 --> 02:55:15,780
Damn.

4977
02:55:15,860 --> 02:55:16,900
There's something to it, right?

4978
02:55:17,080 --> 02:55:17,560
Exposed.

4979
02:55:19,640 --> 02:55:20,820
There's something to it, yeah.

4980
02:55:20,940 --> 02:55:22,140
Oh, thanks, Justin.

4981
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:28,440
Thanks, Justin.

4982
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:28,800
For what?

4983
02:55:28,920 --> 02:55:30,200
Oh, Justin just came in.

4984
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:31,240
He's like, I'm doing good.

4985
02:55:31,700 --> 02:55:32,340
Oh, okay.

4986
02:55:32,460 --> 02:55:32,980
Yeah, yeah.

4987
02:55:34,200 --> 02:55:35,480
It's like Brian gives a...

4988
02:55:39,580 --> 02:55:40,740
That's how I'm feeling right now.

4989
02:55:40,760 --> 02:55:42,440
Remember who made you that video you didn't want.

4990
02:55:42,580 --> 02:55:43,060
That's how I'm feeling.

4991
02:55:43,160 --> 02:55:46,180
I watched the video after this.

4992
02:55:46,280 --> 02:55:47,100
But you know what's crazy?

4993
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,600
Justin is my coach.

4994
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:49,600
Oh, shit.

4995
02:55:50,820 --> 02:55:51,620
I did...

4996
02:55:51,620 --> 02:55:55,260
They have a semi-pro thing for Street Fighter called Street Fighter League.

4997
02:55:55,420 --> 02:55:56,460
And I was in season one.

4998
02:55:56,600 --> 02:55:57,780
And he was my captain.

4999
02:55:57,800 --> 02:55:58,200
Oh, yay.

5000
02:55:59,580 --> 02:55:59,980
Yeah.

5001
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:01,940
And he was a godlike captain and coach.

5002
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:03,980
Like, he gives you such good advice.

5003
02:56:04,180 --> 02:56:04,900
Like, yeah.

5004
02:56:04,980 --> 02:56:05,480
So shout out to him.

5005
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:05,720
Shout out to Justin.

5006
02:56:05,800 --> 02:56:06,320
Oh, my god.

5007
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:07,420
Let's go, Justin.

5008
02:56:07,980 --> 02:56:09,520
He's like grandpa coach over there.

5009
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:13,560
Dude, I'm so tempted to do the knock-knock feature on Sajam.

5010
02:56:13,720 --> 02:56:14,780
I want to collaborate with him.

5011
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:19,700
You heard the reason why this feature is going to get taken down.

5012
02:56:20,560 --> 02:56:20,960
Sajam.

5013
02:56:20,980 --> 02:56:23,560
Twitch, this guy, coefficient, keeps knocking on my stream.

5014
02:56:23,660 --> 02:56:24,560
I want to knock.

5015
02:56:24,760 --> 02:56:26,740
I want to collaborate, Sajam.

5016
02:56:26,820 --> 02:56:27,500
Come on.

5017
02:56:27,900 --> 02:56:29,400
What a strange feature, dude.

5018
02:56:30,060 --> 02:56:32,120
I'm going to be knocking on your door real soon, coach.

5019
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:33,780
Does anybody actually use that feature?

5020
02:56:33,880 --> 02:56:34,280
Like...

5021
02:56:34,980 --> 02:56:35,480
I don't know.

5022
02:56:35,500 --> 02:56:35,760
No.

5023
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:37,140
Like when...

5024
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:38,740
Twitch just focuses on the wrong things.

5025
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:39,820
It's very strange.

5026
02:56:40,060 --> 02:56:40,500
Damn.

5027
02:56:42,760 --> 02:56:45,340
Okay, so we're going to be on stage two.

5028
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:48,700
We haven't sent invites yet, so we're just chilling.

5029
02:56:48,840 --> 02:56:48,920
Yeah, I'm not waiting.

5030
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:50,120
Nah, I'm chilling.

5031
02:56:50,380 --> 02:56:50,640
Yeah.

5032
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:51,720
I'm just watching the stream right now.

5033
02:56:53,460 --> 02:56:55,660
Oh, it's Kana and Lily right now.

5034
02:56:57,020 --> 02:56:57,700
Oh, yeah.

5035
02:56:57,820 --> 02:56:58,200
It's Shine.

5036
02:56:58,880 --> 02:57:00,140
We beat both these teams.

5037
02:57:00,260 --> 02:57:00,920
Oh, hell yeah.

5038
02:57:00,920 --> 02:57:01,380
All right.

5039
02:57:01,480 --> 02:57:02,360
We're freaking sick.

5040
02:57:02,780 --> 02:57:03,680
Welcome back.

5041
02:57:03,740 --> 02:57:04,180
Welcome back.

5042
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:06,160
Thanks.

5043
02:57:06,620 --> 02:57:08,240
We're just waiting for our lobby.

5044
02:57:08,860 --> 02:57:10,420
Do you feel less powerful now?

5045
02:57:11,180 --> 02:57:11,580
No.

5046
02:57:11,700 --> 02:57:12,920
I feel better.

5047
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:14,300
I feel like a better human.

5048
02:57:14,500 --> 02:57:14,720
Co-efficient?

5049
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:16,980
You got this all backwards, man.

5050
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:21,200
Dude, I think your body's telling you the wrong information.

5051
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:28,500
Yo, before a tournament, when you're pulled 15, 10 minutes out, you check in, you tell the bracket runner, be right back, and you go to the bathroom.

5052
02:57:28,640 --> 02:57:29,200
It's just what you do.

5053
02:57:29,200 --> 02:57:29,660
That's what I do.

5054
02:57:30,020 --> 02:57:30,420
Yeah.

5055
02:57:30,460 --> 02:57:30,640
Yeah.

5056
02:57:30,780 --> 02:57:31,600
I don't do that.

5057
02:57:31,660 --> 02:57:34,120
See, I think about the TO bracket runners, you know?

5058
02:57:34,120 --> 02:57:35,440
I was like, no, bro.

5059
02:57:35,540 --> 02:57:35,860
I took it.

5060
02:57:36,220 --> 02:57:37,180
We checked in.

5061
02:57:37,260 --> 02:57:40,120
We told them, and we'll be right back before the time is called.

5062
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:41,360
I even asked them.

5063
02:57:41,400 --> 02:57:43,340
I was like, hey, I got enough time.

5064
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:44,940
They're like, yeah, yeah, you're good.

5065
02:57:45,660 --> 02:57:46,020
Exactly.

5066
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:47,860
That's the flow chart.

5067
02:57:48,240 --> 02:57:51,240
Not this psycho over here trying to hold it in the whole time.

5068
02:57:51,740 --> 02:57:54,080
I'm just, I'm telling you guys, the piss buff is real.

5069
02:57:54,240 --> 02:58:00,720
The thing is, like, the nerves make me thirsty, and then I've chugged so much water, and then I have to keep using the bathroom.

5070
02:58:00,780 --> 02:58:01,000
It sucks.

5071
02:58:01,300 --> 02:58:01,960
Oh, no.

5072
02:58:01,960 --> 02:58:03,120
These pretzels are making me thirsty.

5073
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:04,040
Yo, I feel the same way, dude.

5074
02:58:04,100 --> 02:58:04,460
Yeah.

5075
02:58:04,520 --> 02:58:05,220
Oh, we got the code.

5076
02:58:06,360 --> 02:58:07,100
Oh, we got it?

5077
02:58:07,140 --> 02:58:07,260
Okay.

5078
02:58:07,400 --> 02:58:08,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5079
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:11,600
You mean the invite?

5080
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:12,700
Yeah, the invite.

5081
02:58:13,780 --> 02:58:14,620
Who's it gonna be from?

5082
02:58:15,080 --> 02:58:15,780
Stage one.

5083
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:18,040
Is it The Bones?

5084
02:58:18,160 --> 02:58:18,540
I'll check.

5085
02:58:18,640 --> 02:58:18,840
Stage one.

5086
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:20,940
Yeah, Bones.

5087
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:21,340
It's The Bones.

5088
02:58:21,540 --> 02:58:22,700
Oh, Da Bones.

5089
02:58:24,100 --> 02:58:24,640
All right.

5090
02:58:24,720 --> 02:58:25,760
Let's finish this off.

5091
02:58:26,240 --> 02:58:27,640
Oh, I haven't even received mine.

5092
02:58:27,780 --> 02:58:28,060
Damn.

5093
02:58:29,120 --> 02:58:30,120
Oh, sorry, bro.

5094
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:30,780
The piss keeps me sharp.

5095
02:58:31,060 --> 02:58:31,420
Exactly.

5096
02:58:32,940 --> 02:58:33,420
You're so mean.

5097
02:58:33,420 --> 02:58:34,060
It keeps me on edge.

5098
02:58:34,060 --> 02:58:34,080
It keeps me on edge.

5099
02:58:34,100 --> 02:58:36,000
We'll see how sharp you are after your match ends.

5100
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:37,080
I'm telling you, bro.

5101
02:58:38,180 --> 02:58:38,620
Yeah.

5102
02:58:38,980 --> 02:58:44,840
You're sharp if you remember to leave the lobby after your match ends.

5103
02:58:44,920 --> 02:58:45,760
That's when we'll know.

5104
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:46,420
You're locked in.

5105
02:58:46,440 --> 02:58:47,800
That's my only weakness right now.

5106
02:58:48,160 --> 02:58:49,460
I'll do it.

5107
02:58:49,620 --> 02:58:52,460
This time, I'm gonna remember to get out immediately.

5108
02:58:54,140 --> 02:58:57,420
Listen, if it lets you win, do whatever you gotta do.

5109
02:58:57,540 --> 02:58:58,240
Stay there.

5110
02:58:58,700 --> 02:58:59,760
Dance on their grave.

5111
02:59:00,340 --> 02:59:00,780
Okay.

5112
02:59:01,160 --> 02:59:02,420
What else does Seratina do?

5113
02:59:02,420 --> 02:59:03,720
What else does Seratina do?

5114
02:59:03,880 --> 02:59:04,080
I don't know.

5115
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:05,940
I don't remember.

5116
02:59:06,360 --> 02:59:10,420
So, the only other thing she does is she likes to do the full-screen flying punch.

5117
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:11,060
Oh, okay.

5118
02:59:11,080 --> 02:59:12,080
So, I just block that.

5119
02:59:12,820 --> 02:59:13,260
Yeah.

5120
02:59:13,380 --> 02:59:16,540
Just the one where she lays down and then goes, wah, and like dives at you.

5121
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:16,920
Yeah.

5122
02:59:16,960 --> 02:59:18,980
If you block it, just press triangle or level three.

5123
02:59:19,120 --> 02:59:19,320
Okay.

5124
02:59:20,740 --> 02:59:21,180
Okay.

5125
02:59:21,180 --> 02:59:26,400
Other than that, she's waiting for you to DI, so just don't use DI randomly like that.

5126
02:59:26,400 --> 02:59:26,660
Yeah.

5127
02:59:26,660 --> 02:59:27,420
I'll just grab more than...

5128
02:59:27,860 --> 02:59:28,300
Yeah.

5129
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:28,580
Or jump.

5130
02:59:28,580 --> 02:59:29,120
Which is worse.

5131
02:59:29,320 --> 02:59:30,720
Which is worse for her.

5132
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:34,440
Yeah.

5133
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:36,000
I'm sorry.

5134
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:37,280
Okay.

5135
02:59:37,940 --> 02:59:38,420
No!

5136
02:59:38,420 --> 02:59:39,280
She chose heads!

5137
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:39,920
No!

5138
02:59:40,440 --> 02:59:41,060
Don't worry.

5139
02:59:41,260 --> 02:59:41,860
Don't worry.

5140
02:59:41,960 --> 02:59:42,560
Wait, hold on.

5141
02:59:42,600 --> 02:59:43,120
Come on.

5142
02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:43,640
Come on.

5143
02:59:44,140 --> 02:59:44,620
No!

5144
02:59:44,720 --> 02:59:45,440
Well, damn, dude.

5145
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:46,400
The one time, bro.

5146
02:59:46,780 --> 02:59:49,180
The one time I failed the coin flip.

5147
02:59:50,320 --> 02:59:50,980
God damn it.

5148
02:59:50,980 --> 02:59:51,680
Can I have P1?

5149
02:59:51,780 --> 02:59:52,560
Damn, bro.

5150
02:59:52,740 --> 02:59:53,340
What is this, dude?

5151
02:59:53,340 --> 02:59:54,500
Is everyone the older sibling?

5152
02:59:54,620 --> 02:59:56,640
Why doesn't anyone like player two, dude?

5153
02:59:56,740 --> 02:59:57,060
It's not.

5154
02:59:57,340 --> 02:59:58,680
It's because I'm left-brained.

5155
02:59:58,680 --> 02:59:59,500
I'm left-brained.

5156
03:00:00,180 --> 03:00:00,660
I'm left-brained.

5157
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:02,320
I'm left, right?

5158
03:00:02,720 --> 03:00:04,880
I can only process the left.

5159
03:00:07,220 --> 03:00:08,300
Wait, I don't remember...

5160
03:00:08,300 --> 03:00:09,960
Does she... I'm knowledge check.

5161
03:00:10,020 --> 03:00:11,960
I don't remember if she has the knowledge.

5162
03:00:12,280 --> 03:00:13,240
Does she have the knowledge?

5163
03:00:14,060 --> 03:00:16,080
If you know what that means, do it.

5164
03:00:16,180 --> 03:00:16,560
I don't know.

5165
03:00:17,240 --> 03:00:19,020
You're getting so solid, Doki.

5166
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:24,180
One day, you don't have to do the knowledge check.

5167
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:26,400
I mean, that says something about the coach.

5168
03:00:26,400 --> 03:00:27,220
Just letting you know.

5169
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:29,440
Okay, she knows it.

5170
03:00:29,480 --> 03:00:30,100
She knows it.

5171
03:00:31,660 --> 03:00:33,140
It don't even matter.

5172
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:34,480
We're good.

5173
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:36,560
I'll just...

5174
03:00:37,220 --> 03:00:38,480
Walk her down.

5175
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:40,340
Just walk her down.

5176
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:42,620
Oh my god!

5177
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:43,760
Exactly.

5178
03:00:44,220 --> 03:00:47,180
She doesn't drive, so I'll just walk up and grab.

5179
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:48,240
Exactly.

5180
03:00:48,540 --> 03:00:51,520
She's trying to counter DI me, so I'll walk up.

5181
03:00:52,400 --> 03:00:53,960
They're gonna make you fight SK.

5182
03:00:54,180 --> 03:00:56,060
They're gonna make you fight SK's people, man.

5183
03:00:57,220 --> 03:00:57,640
I'm bad.

5184
03:00:57,780 --> 03:00:58,420
I swear.

5185
03:00:58,540 --> 03:01:00,240
I swear the guy.

5186
03:01:01,620 --> 03:01:03,020
Oh my lord.

5187
03:01:03,080 --> 03:01:04,040
I don't know.

5188
03:01:04,220 --> 03:01:04,720
I'm P1!

5189
03:01:04,820 --> 03:01:05,220
Let's go!

5190
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:06,920
That's not right!

5191
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:09,200
The real dub of the day.

5192
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:14,240
Okay, I need to focus.

5193
03:01:14,300 --> 03:01:16,140
Oh my god.

5194
03:01:16,420 --> 03:01:18,200
She's got real combos.

5195
03:01:18,880 --> 03:01:19,780
That's not fair.

5196
03:01:20,980 --> 03:01:22,680
Well, you got real combos too.

5197
03:01:22,820 --> 03:01:23,480
Do I?

5198
03:01:24,060 --> 03:01:25,580
Yeah, do your real combos.

5199
03:01:25,840 --> 03:01:26,120
Do I?

5200
03:01:27,220 --> 03:01:27,520
Oh no.

5201
03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:29,400
Oh no.

5202
03:01:30,020 --> 03:01:31,640
But she improved a lot.

5203
03:01:32,440 --> 03:01:33,040
It's okay.

5204
03:01:33,060 --> 03:01:33,840
Don't worry about it.

5205
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:35,120
Can we get a hand can?

5206
03:01:35,340 --> 03:01:36,140
Is this her playing?

5207
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:37,440
Damn.

5208
03:01:40,180 --> 03:01:40,620
Proof?

5209
03:01:40,620 --> 03:01:41,140
Question mark?

5210
03:01:41,860 --> 03:01:42,920
That's fucking toxic.

5211
03:01:43,720 --> 03:01:44,600
Oh no.

5212
03:01:45,020 --> 03:01:46,240
I don't think you should be talking.

5213
03:01:46,620 --> 03:01:49,440
I don't think you should be talking right now.

5214
03:01:49,800 --> 03:01:50,320
Let's go.

5215
03:01:51,060 --> 03:01:52,260
I don't think you should be talking.

5216
03:01:52,380 --> 03:01:54,780
Modern has to be inhumane.

5217
03:01:54,780 --> 03:01:56,360
How can you just do that?

5218
03:01:56,800 --> 03:02:00,840
This makes me so mad because this is like a classic versus modern.

5219
03:02:01,240 --> 03:02:02,640
She's just having the time of her life.

5220
03:02:02,800 --> 03:02:04,120
And she's struggling over there.

5221
03:02:04,340 --> 03:02:05,460
Oh no, the DI.

5222
03:02:07,080 --> 03:02:08,920
She's really good at DI counting.

5223
03:02:09,140 --> 03:02:09,980
Yeah, she's not bad.

5224
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:11,080
Nice.

5225
03:02:12,060 --> 03:02:15,560
She waits for that, so that's why triangle and everything else works.

5226
03:02:17,420 --> 03:02:18,300
Hey, go.

5227
03:02:18,400 --> 03:02:18,840
Good job.

5228
03:02:19,940 --> 03:02:20,620
Oh no.

5229
03:02:20,980 --> 03:02:21,940
Oh, the spacing.

5230
03:02:21,940 --> 03:02:23,340
That was a good idea, that was a good idea.

5231
03:02:23,420 --> 03:02:23,640
Yeah.

5232
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:26,560
Oh, unlucky.

5233
03:02:27,440 --> 03:02:28,740
Yeah, that's fine.

5234
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:30,340
The jump-ins are still a good idea.

5235
03:02:30,540 --> 03:02:33,620
Oh, she's gonna throw loop you.

5236
03:02:33,800 --> 03:02:34,080
Okay.

5237
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:38,700
Can you focus?

5238
03:02:39,180 --> 03:02:40,060
Good parry.

5239
03:02:40,440 --> 03:02:43,340
Oh, that's the move.

5240
03:02:43,380 --> 03:02:43,840
Oh shit.

5241
03:02:43,940 --> 03:02:44,700
Oh fuck, goodbye.

5242
03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:46,200
That's alright.

5243
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:48,700
You can find a jump.

5244
03:02:49,020 --> 03:02:51,080
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

5245
03:02:51,940 --> 03:02:52,720
You're selling this.

5246
03:02:52,760 --> 03:02:53,560
Never say never.

5247
03:02:54,840 --> 03:02:57,000
Okay, it's okay, block it.

5248
03:02:57,240 --> 03:02:58,200
And walk up.

5249
03:02:58,440 --> 03:02:58,880
No!

5250
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:03,000
Focus, I guess.

5251
03:03:03,020 --> 03:03:03,960
That's fine, you made her waste the meter.

5252
03:03:04,120 --> 03:03:05,240
I guess, I guess.

5253
03:03:07,280 --> 03:03:08,060
No worries.

5254
03:03:12,610 --> 03:03:13,490
Oh shit.

5255
03:03:15,790 --> 03:03:17,410
You're just like me for real.

5256
03:03:17,930 --> 03:03:18,770
What the hell.

5257
03:03:20,250 --> 03:03:20,690
Alright.

5258
03:03:23,790 --> 03:03:24,190
Oh, what?

5259
03:03:24,370 --> 03:03:25,290
That block stat?

5260
03:03:27,270 --> 03:03:28,190
Oh, she's...

5261
03:03:30,290 --> 03:03:31,570
Nice, keep her there.

5262
03:03:32,310 --> 03:03:32,790
Nice.

5263
03:03:35,350 --> 03:03:36,550
She improved a lot.

5264
03:03:37,350 --> 03:03:37,830
Yeah.

5265
03:03:38,410 --> 03:03:40,090
You did too, you did too.

5266
03:03:40,150 --> 03:03:40,610
You got this.

5267
03:03:41,650 --> 03:03:42,470
You got this.

5268
03:03:42,470 --> 03:03:43,490
Oh no.

5269
03:03:44,030 --> 03:03:44,830
It's alright, it's alright.

5270
03:03:47,970 --> 03:03:48,450
Alright.

5271
03:03:48,810 --> 03:03:49,290
Okay.

5272
03:03:49,930 --> 03:03:50,550
Okay, okay.

5273
03:03:50,550 --> 03:03:52,510
Time to sit up, lock in Doki.

5274
03:03:53,150 --> 03:03:54,990
DI off the table against her, right?

5275
03:03:55,210 --> 03:03:55,790
DI off?

5276
03:03:55,910 --> 03:03:58,110
No, it's off the table.

5277
03:03:58,430 --> 03:03:59,990
Okay, no more DI's, okay.

5278
03:04:00,330 --> 03:04:01,790
Yeah, she's too good at counter DI.

5279
03:04:02,170 --> 03:04:02,610
Okay.

5280
03:04:03,430 --> 03:04:05,830
Jump X is still good, if you're close to her.

5281
03:04:05,970 --> 03:04:07,410
The squares are also your friend.

5282
03:04:07,850 --> 03:04:09,430
But beyond that, playing good.

5283
03:04:10,550 --> 03:04:10,990
Okay.

5284
03:04:11,990 --> 03:04:12,430
Yeah.

5285
03:04:14,430 --> 03:04:15,790
She's like waiting for me.

5286
03:04:16,950 --> 03:04:17,390
Yep.

5287
03:04:17,970 --> 03:04:19,350
Oh, I need to not do that.

5288
03:04:19,650 --> 03:04:20,070
Yeah, yeah.

5289
03:04:20,550 --> 03:04:21,810
She's throwing you instead of...

5290
03:04:21,810 --> 03:04:22,290
Yeah.

5291
03:04:23,230 --> 03:04:24,050
...doing DI.

5292
03:04:30,030 --> 03:04:31,370
Yeah, I can't jump too.

5293
03:04:32,390 --> 03:04:34,210
Yeah, so that's when you gotta use your other buttons.

5294
03:04:35,530 --> 03:04:36,030
What?

5295
03:04:39,950 --> 03:04:40,450
Hmm.

5296
03:04:44,520 --> 03:04:46,340
They're trying to go to Toshicon pretty bad.

5297
03:04:47,480 --> 03:04:48,400
I respect that.

5298
03:04:48,580 --> 03:04:50,200
Nice punish, nice punish.

5299
03:04:50,320 --> 03:04:51,060
Now you can get in.

5300
03:04:52,660 --> 03:04:53,160
Ooh.

5301
03:04:56,260 --> 03:04:57,020
Okay, okay.

5302
03:04:57,480 --> 03:05:02,060
Yeah, she's got a mix between hit and throw and her wake up.

5303
03:05:03,640 --> 03:05:04,160
Let's

5304
03:05:08,120 --> 03:05:08,600
see.

5305
03:05:13,240 --> 03:05:15,720
Nice walk down to the corner.

5306
03:05:16,700 --> 03:05:17,440
Oh, shit.

5307
03:05:17,480 --> 03:05:18,040
What the fuck?

5308
03:05:18,120 --> 03:05:18,960
That was an accident.

5309
03:05:20,400 --> 03:05:21,100
You're good.

5310
03:05:22,120 --> 03:05:22,640
Oh.

5311
03:05:22,640 --> 03:05:23,400
There you go.

5312
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:24,200
Nice.

5313
03:05:24,880 --> 03:05:25,400
Nice.

5314
03:05:28,280 --> 03:05:28,800
Yeehaw.

5315
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:29,400
Let's go.

5316
03:05:30,820 --> 03:05:31,300
Nice.

5317
03:05:32,080 --> 03:05:35,720
She's making me very less aggressive, so I'm not used to it.

5318
03:05:38,140 --> 03:05:38,620
Nice.

5319
03:05:38,800 --> 03:05:40,060
You're playing well.

5320
03:05:40,660 --> 03:05:42,280
You're playing really good, actually.

5321
03:05:43,860 --> 03:05:44,380
That's okay.

5322
03:05:44,960 --> 03:05:45,840
We take those.

5323
03:05:48,280 --> 03:05:51,280
She's backing up a lot, so I'm not used to that at all.

5324
03:05:51,300 --> 03:05:52,880
But she's in disadvantage at the wall like that.

5325
03:05:53,260 --> 03:05:53,740
Nice!

5326
03:05:53,840 --> 03:05:54,320
Get her!

5327
03:05:54,960 --> 03:05:58,700
When she corners herself, it's bad for her, so it's okay.

5328
03:05:58,800 --> 03:05:59,840
I don't know what to do when...

5329
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:01,680
Because she does like...

5330
03:06:04,500 --> 03:06:07,400
Because she anti-airs me too, so it's like...

5331
03:06:08,320 --> 03:06:10,780
You can press heavy punch if you have her near the corner.

5332
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:11,480
Oh, I know.

5333
03:06:11,680 --> 03:06:12,160
Okay.

5334
03:06:12,360 --> 03:06:12,820
Yeah.

5335
03:06:19,990 --> 03:06:20,470
Nice.

5336
03:06:20,470 --> 03:06:20,790
Okay.

5337
03:06:21,110 --> 03:06:21,590
Nice!

5338
03:06:22,390 --> 03:06:22,870
Okay.

5339
03:06:26,290 --> 03:06:26,770
Okay.

5340
03:06:27,070 --> 03:06:27,550
Okay.

5341
03:06:27,670 --> 03:06:28,210
Let's go.

5342
03:06:28,450 --> 03:06:28,810
Oh.

5343
03:06:32,270 --> 03:06:32,710
Oh.

5344
03:06:32,830 --> 03:06:33,310
I'm lucky.

5345
03:06:38,130 --> 03:06:38,570
Nice!

5346
03:06:38,710 --> 03:06:39,670
Oh my gosh.

5347
03:06:40,330 --> 03:06:41,390
Remember, you have level three.

5348
03:06:41,570 --> 03:06:42,010
Yeah.

5349
03:06:42,390 --> 03:06:43,770
Yeah, next level three will kill.

5350
03:06:46,970 --> 03:06:47,930
Oh, I hit that.

5351
03:06:48,050 --> 03:06:48,390
I'm lucky.

5352
03:06:50,970 --> 03:06:51,410
What?

5353
03:06:52,850 --> 03:06:53,370
It's okay.

5354
03:06:53,450 --> 03:06:53,650
It's okay.

5355
03:06:58,130 --> 03:06:59,010
Oh no!

5356
03:06:59,650 --> 03:07:00,090
Okay.

5357
03:07:00,730 --> 03:07:01,170
Okay.

5358
03:07:02,470 --> 03:07:03,350
Do I hit that?

5359
03:07:03,710 --> 03:07:04,190
Yes.

5360
03:07:04,670 --> 03:07:06,290
The legendary!

5361
03:07:06,290 --> 03:07:07,190
Do I hit that?

5362
03:07:07,190 --> 03:07:08,210
Oh my god.

5363
03:07:08,770 --> 03:07:09,250
Okay.

5364
03:07:10,210 --> 03:07:10,730
Let's go.

5365
03:07:11,430 --> 03:07:12,470
You did it!

5366
03:07:12,530 --> 03:07:13,710
You went undefeated today.

5367
03:07:13,710 --> 03:07:14,710
I'm undefeated.

5368
03:07:15,110 --> 03:07:17,590
I don't know what to do when she does that.

5369
03:07:17,810 --> 03:07:18,870
She's so passive.

5370
03:07:19,210 --> 03:07:20,830
Well, you adapted really... I'm... I'm...

5371
03:07:20,830 --> 03:07:21,810
I'm serious.

5372
03:07:23,310 --> 03:07:25,210
I'm surprised how well you did today.

5373
03:07:25,310 --> 03:07:26,230
You did really good.

5374
03:07:26,750 --> 03:07:28,270
And you didn't even watch the video.

5375
03:07:28,430 --> 03:07:28,910
How the hell?

5376
03:07:29,490 --> 03:07:30,690
I went undefeated!

5377
03:07:30,750 --> 03:07:31,090
Let's go!

5378
03:07:31,850 --> 03:07:33,970
You are a master of neutral.

5379
03:07:34,230 --> 03:07:35,690
I'm so proud right now.

5380
03:07:35,690 --> 03:07:36,530
You are a master of neutral.

5381
03:07:36,610 --> 03:07:39,350
You have to keep up the gif streak.

5382
03:07:39,770 --> 03:07:42,410
Dude, I gotta fight the final boss.

5383
03:07:42,490 --> 03:07:44,690
You gotta fight the raid boss.

5384
03:07:45,310 --> 03:07:45,910
I got this.

5385
03:07:46,170 --> 03:07:47,550
Gotta cheer him on, dude.

5386
03:07:47,690 --> 03:07:50,550
As he enters the fog gate and sees Roy there.

5387
03:07:51,090 --> 03:07:51,910
No, for real.

5388
03:07:51,950 --> 03:07:53,390
That was good though.

5389
03:07:53,430 --> 03:07:55,110
That was wonderful gif gameplay.

5390
03:07:55,270 --> 03:07:56,370
It was really good.

5391
03:07:56,970 --> 03:07:57,650
Good job.

5392
03:07:58,910 --> 03:07:59,090
You ready for this one?

5393
03:07:59,870 --> 03:08:01,230
Alright SK, you got this.

5394
03:08:01,950 --> 03:08:02,590
Let's do this.

5395
03:08:02,730 --> 03:08:03,790
You're gonna mash that tower combo.

5396
03:08:04,110 --> 03:08:06,390
You got the mediums and you got DI's to counter.

5397
03:08:06,770 --> 03:08:08,150
I'm very nervous today.

5398
03:08:08,190 --> 03:08:09,930
I'm playing nothing like I usually play.

5399
03:08:10,150 --> 03:08:10,650
That's okay.

5400
03:08:10,850 --> 03:08:13,470
You just gotta lean into the nerves.

5401
03:08:13,710 --> 03:08:14,690
You know, you can't fight it.

5402
03:08:15,150 --> 03:08:17,230
I've been accepting them, you know.

5403
03:08:17,610 --> 03:08:18,630
Yeah, me too.

5404
03:08:21,170 --> 03:08:22,230
You're gonna be nervous.

5405
03:08:22,390 --> 03:08:23,350
It's part of the fun.

5406
03:08:24,050 --> 03:08:27,690
Alright, here we go.

5407
03:08:35,400 --> 03:08:35,800
Nice.

5408
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:38,300
That's fine.

5409
03:08:38,600 --> 03:08:39,080
That's fine.

5410
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:40,980
No punish on them.

5411
03:08:41,220 --> 03:08:41,700
Oh,

5412
03:08:45,750 --> 03:08:48,070
I keep throwing.

5413
03:08:48,430 --> 03:08:49,470
I will not throw.

5414
03:08:50,330 --> 03:08:50,990
Here we go.

5415
03:09:01,180 --> 03:09:01,660
Nice.

5416
03:09:03,100 --> 03:09:03,580
Alright.

5417
03:09:05,120 --> 03:09:06,080
Oh, yeah.

5418
03:09:10,820 --> 03:09:11,300
Okay.

5419
03:09:14,200 --> 03:09:14,680
Oh.

5420
03:09:15,460 --> 03:09:16,080
That's alright.

5421
03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:16,840
Good try.

5422
03:09:16,920 --> 03:09:17,080
Good try.

5423
03:09:18,220 --> 03:09:19,020
You're playing great.

5424
03:09:19,480 --> 03:09:19,920
Yeah.

5425
03:09:24,420 --> 03:09:25,380
Very close.

5426
03:09:27,120 --> 03:09:27,600
Nice.

5427
03:09:27,720 --> 03:09:28,200
Nice.

5428
03:09:28,380 --> 03:09:28,860
Nice.

5429
03:09:29,260 --> 03:09:29,780
I'm back.

5430
03:09:30,240 --> 03:09:30,720
Awesome.

5431
03:09:32,800 --> 03:09:33,500
She's crazy.

5432
03:09:33,520 --> 03:09:34,360
She burned the meter.

5433
03:09:38,230 --> 03:09:39,190
Nice blocks.

5434
03:09:39,410 --> 03:09:39,950
Good blocks.

5435
03:09:39,990 --> 03:09:40,350
Good blocks.

5436
03:09:46,630 --> 03:09:47,470
How is this?

5437
03:09:50,590 --> 03:09:51,290
Oh, nice.

5438
03:09:51,570 --> 03:09:52,050
Alright.

5439
03:09:54,890 --> 03:09:55,690
Good grab.

5440
03:09:58,310 --> 03:09:59,150
Oh, nice.

5441
03:09:59,610 --> 03:10:00,090
Oh, nice.

5442
03:10:02,820 --> 03:10:03,680
Nice punish.

5443
03:10:04,020 --> 03:10:04,780
That was unsafe.

5444
03:10:04,880 --> 03:10:05,300
Good punish.

5445
03:10:05,500 --> 03:10:06,100
Let's go!

5446
03:10:06,300 --> 03:10:07,420
Yeah, let's go!

5447
03:10:07,420 --> 03:10:11,960
Yeah, that was the medium punch, heavy punch right there that you punish with a throw.

5448
03:10:12,400 --> 03:10:12,880
Oh.

5449
03:10:21,290 --> 03:10:22,250
Good parries.

5450
03:10:22,910 --> 03:10:23,390
Hadouken!

5451
03:10:24,150 --> 03:10:24,630
Hadouken!

5452
03:10:25,810 --> 03:10:26,330
Hadouken!

5453
03:10:28,510 --> 03:10:29,030
Punish.

5454
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:29,390
Yes.

5455
03:10:29,510 --> 03:10:29,970
Good job.

5456
03:10:29,990 --> 03:10:30,430
Nice punish.

5457
03:10:31,830 --> 03:10:32,990
Oh, I like the baits.

5458
03:10:33,190 --> 03:10:34,190
Good one!

5459
03:10:34,810 --> 03:10:35,430
That was perfect.

5460
03:10:36,270 --> 03:10:36,790
Nice!

5461
03:10:37,070 --> 03:10:37,750
And get the super.

5462
03:10:37,950 --> 03:10:40,850
All they do is drag and lash.

5463
03:10:41,330 --> 03:10:41,970
Let's go.

5464
03:10:43,050 --> 03:10:44,910
That felt good, didn't it?

5465
03:10:46,830 --> 03:10:48,170
Oh, my god!

5466
03:10:48,190 --> 03:10:48,670
You're sick!

5467
03:10:48,750 --> 03:10:49,750
Another punish?

5468
03:10:53,540 --> 03:10:54,760
He's scared now.

5469
03:10:54,940 --> 03:10:55,540
Okay, okay, okay.

5470
03:10:57,060 --> 03:10:57,540
Nice.

5471
03:10:58,720 --> 03:10:59,200
Yup.

5472
03:10:59,340 --> 03:10:59,760
Yup.

5473
03:11:00,600 --> 03:11:01,080
Oh!

5474
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:01,540
Yes!

5475
03:11:01,620 --> 03:11:02,560
Oh, my god!

5476
03:11:02,640 --> 03:11:03,120
You got the...

5477
03:11:03,120 --> 03:11:04,900
You got a stock combo!

5478
03:11:06,960 --> 03:11:07,880
You're sick with it.

5479
03:11:08,060 --> 03:11:08,540
Yes!

5480
03:11:09,560 --> 03:11:10,240
Let's go!

5481
03:11:10,540 --> 03:11:11,440
Let's go, SK!

5482
03:11:12,420 --> 03:11:13,380
Team SK!

5483
03:11:14,160 --> 03:11:16,360
Oh, my goodness.

5484
03:11:16,860 --> 03:11:17,600
That was clean.

5485
03:11:17,640 --> 03:11:20,180
That was so clean, dude.

5486
03:11:21,120 --> 03:11:21,720
Yeah, you got this.

5487
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:25,640
Nice!

5488
03:11:25,780 --> 03:11:26,120
Get him!

5489
03:11:26,520 --> 03:11:27,520
Oh, perfect!

5490
03:11:28,840 --> 03:11:29,820
Oh, the pressure!

5491
03:11:30,080 --> 03:11:32,080
Oh, the pressure!

5492
03:11:32,820 --> 03:11:33,540
That's fine.

5493
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:34,620
She's locked in!

5494
03:11:37,160 --> 03:11:38,900
She doesn't expect it twice in a row.

5495
03:11:39,740 --> 03:11:40,840
That's right, SK!

5496
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:42,900
You didn't expect the second one!

5497
03:11:44,960 --> 03:11:46,240
What about three in a row?

5498
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:47,000
No, actually, don't troll.

5499
03:11:49,680 --> 03:11:50,120
Nice.

5500
03:11:50,120 --> 03:11:50,860
Super grab.

5501
03:11:51,120 --> 03:11:51,920
They were trying to bait the DP.

5502
03:11:56,350 --> 03:11:57,270
Oh, no.

5503
03:11:57,370 --> 03:11:58,670
She expected it three times.

5504
03:11:58,710 --> 03:11:59,290
Alright, alright, alright.

5505
03:11:59,630 --> 03:12:01,530
Two is the magic number, not three.

5506
03:12:02,810 --> 03:12:03,590
Mid-screen?

5507
03:12:04,010 --> 03:12:06,570
Remember, mid-screen blocking is all good.

5508
03:12:06,770 --> 03:12:07,550
Chill, chill.

5509
03:12:10,510 --> 03:12:10,950
Nice.

5510
03:12:11,110 --> 03:12:11,430
Good life.

5511
03:12:11,470 --> 03:12:11,910
Woo!

5512
03:12:15,570 --> 03:12:16,010
Okay.

5513
03:12:17,330 --> 03:12:18,030
Oh, get him!

5514
03:12:19,530 --> 03:12:20,290
Nice combo.

5515
03:12:20,830 --> 03:12:21,330
Let's go.

5516
03:12:22,950 --> 03:12:23,310
Okay.

5517
03:12:23,650 --> 03:12:25,390
Oh, throw a loop on her.

5518
03:12:25,430 --> 03:12:26,370
Oh, you know what to do here.

5519
03:12:30,270 --> 03:12:31,670
Oh, thank god she messed up.

5520
03:12:34,510 --> 03:12:35,230
Yep, that's fine.

5521
03:12:38,570 --> 03:12:38,930
Nice!

5522
03:12:39,610 --> 03:12:40,330
Good reactions!

5523
03:12:41,530 --> 03:12:42,110
Get him!

5524
03:12:42,310 --> 03:12:43,370
You got those on player one!

5525
03:12:44,230 --> 03:12:45,770
You got those on player one!

5526
03:12:47,730 --> 03:12:48,150
Let's go.

5527
03:12:48,270 --> 03:12:48,630
Alright.

5528
03:12:50,290 --> 03:12:51,070
They got one more hit.

5529
03:12:51,130 --> 03:12:53,590
SK is more confident with the super-each now.

5530
03:12:53,630 --> 03:12:54,090
Nice!

5531
03:12:54,090 --> 03:12:54,590
Jump in!

5532
03:12:54,710 --> 03:12:55,990
You're playing so clean.

5533
03:12:56,070 --> 03:12:56,630
Oh, my god.

5534
03:12:56,830 --> 03:12:57,530
One more.

5535
03:12:58,030 --> 03:12:59,030
Oh, you needed one more.

5536
03:13:00,410 --> 03:13:01,290
Oh, god.

5537
03:13:01,810 --> 03:13:02,290
Oh,

5538
03:13:07,310 --> 03:13:07,470
nice.

5539
03:13:15,480 --> 03:13:15,960
Nice.

5540
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:18,900
He got mad.

5541
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:19,880
He went flowchart.

5542
03:13:20,760 --> 03:13:21,640
Nice block.

5543
03:13:21,700 --> 03:13:22,200
Mid-screen.

5544
03:13:22,200 --> 03:13:23,020
So good.

5545
03:13:23,320 --> 03:13:25,940
Here we go.

5546
03:13:26,900 --> 03:13:27,780
Oh, nice!

5547
03:13:28,040 --> 03:13:28,100
Nice.

5548
03:13:28,280 --> 03:13:28,920
Jump in.

5549
03:13:30,920 --> 03:13:31,520
Oh.

5550
03:13:33,080 --> 03:13:34,100
Level three.

5551
03:13:34,780 --> 03:13:35,560
That's fine.

5552
03:13:35,980 --> 03:13:38,760
I forgot my kick out of that low.

5553
03:13:39,100 --> 03:13:39,700
Right.

5554
03:13:40,540 --> 03:13:41,940
Sorry, you're still...

5555
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:43,740
You're still in this.

5556
03:13:45,480 --> 03:13:46,160
Uh-huh.

5557
03:13:46,740 --> 03:13:47,720
Very good.

5558
03:13:48,220 --> 03:13:48,820
Okay.

5559
03:13:50,900 --> 03:13:51,340
Okay.

5560
03:13:51,340 --> 03:13:52,420
Oh, that might be it.

5561
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:53,180
Oh, ow.

5562
03:13:54,300 --> 03:13:55,440
Okay, okay.

5563
03:13:56,140 --> 03:13:58,580
Yeah, you're playing very well.

5564
03:13:58,760 --> 03:13:59,200
Yeah, yeah.

5565
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:01,760
And you're adapting and...

5566
03:14:02,480 --> 03:14:04,340
It's just very good, but I feel like...

5567
03:14:04,340 --> 03:14:05,100
Okay, let's go.

5568
03:14:05,160 --> 03:14:05,940
I'm done talking.

5569
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:06,800
Okay, let's go.

5570
03:14:12,340 --> 03:14:13,100
That's the punish.

5571
03:14:13,480 --> 03:14:14,160
There you go.

5572
03:14:15,120 --> 03:14:16,720
Okay, let's just bait those out.

5573
03:14:16,900 --> 03:14:17,660
She's crazy.

5574
03:14:18,100 --> 03:14:20,440
Oh, that combo.

5575
03:14:21,340 --> 03:14:21,620
Let's go.

5576
03:14:21,660 --> 03:14:22,660
You know these.

5577
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:27,440
Nice, Rob.

5578
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:29,540
Step on in.

5579
03:14:30,340 --> 03:14:31,260
Good baits, though.

5580
03:14:31,480 --> 03:14:33,160
We dug highs out here?

5581
03:14:35,120 --> 03:14:36,600
Very all the confidence.

5582
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:37,480
Nice!

5583
03:14:37,700 --> 03:14:38,560
The confidence.

5584
03:14:40,560 --> 03:14:41,760
We got this.

5585
03:14:42,180 --> 03:14:42,880
One more.

5586
03:14:43,340 --> 03:14:43,940
Come here.

5587
03:14:45,380 --> 03:14:47,280
Oh, she didn't get him.

5588
03:14:49,380 --> 03:14:50,820
Okay, that TP was nutty.

5589
03:14:52,380 --> 03:14:53,020
Okay, okay.

5590
03:14:53,100 --> 03:14:54,300
All right, all right.

5591
03:14:54,400 --> 03:14:54,860
That's fine.

5592
03:14:55,860 --> 03:14:56,340
Hadouken.

5593
03:14:58,400 --> 03:14:58,880
Hadouken.

5594
03:15:00,080 --> 03:15:01,000
Nice jumping!

5595
03:15:01,080 --> 03:15:02,620
Oh, so good.

5596
03:15:05,880 --> 03:15:07,400
I need to block every time.

5597
03:15:07,620 --> 03:15:09,240
Yeah, mid screen, just block.

5598
03:15:10,380 --> 03:15:10,980
Get him.

5599
03:15:11,080 --> 03:15:11,640
Did you punish that?

5600
03:15:11,820 --> 03:15:14,140
That's always punishable.

5601
03:15:15,280 --> 03:15:16,140
Oh, nice.

5602
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:19,180
That counter DI was pretty good, though.

5603
03:15:19,200 --> 03:15:19,560
Yeah.

5604
03:15:19,560 --> 03:15:19,820
Yeah.

5605
03:15:20,300 --> 03:15:21,180
Level three.

5606
03:15:21,340 --> 03:15:22,600
Oh, level two.

5607
03:15:22,660 --> 03:15:23,300
That was smart.

5608
03:15:26,420 --> 03:15:28,500
Just block mid screen and you got this.

5609
03:15:28,720 --> 03:15:29,020
All right.

5610
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:29,900
Last game, last round.

5611
03:15:30,020 --> 03:15:30,460
Let's do this.

5612
03:15:30,640 --> 03:15:31,600
I believe.

5613
03:15:32,660 --> 03:15:33,380
I believe.

5614
03:15:47,470 --> 03:15:49,010
The adaptation, though.

5615
03:15:52,250 --> 03:15:52,730
Nice!

5616
03:15:52,970 --> 03:15:53,450
Excellent.

5617
03:15:55,510 --> 03:15:56,330
Cash out.

5618
03:15:56,330 --> 03:15:56,990
Let's go.

5619
03:15:57,130 --> 03:15:58,610
That was great defense.

5620
03:15:58,910 --> 03:16:00,270
All right, all right, all right.

5621
03:16:00,830 --> 03:16:01,810
Did she DP?

5622
03:16:03,490 --> 03:16:04,430
Let's find out.

5623
03:16:04,990 --> 03:16:07,050
Yeah, she did.

5624
03:16:07,470 --> 03:16:08,850
But she's burnt out.

5625
03:16:09,050 --> 03:16:10,130
She's burnt out, yep.

5626
03:16:10,510 --> 03:16:11,450
Don't do it immediately.

5627
03:16:11,810 --> 03:16:14,370
She'll try to jump.

5628
03:16:20,240 --> 03:16:20,720
Nice.

5629
03:16:21,340 --> 03:16:21,820
Nice.

5630
03:16:22,720 --> 03:16:23,460
Yep, heavy.

5631
03:16:24,860 --> 03:16:26,260
Oh, is that death?

5632
03:16:26,760 --> 03:16:27,660
Modern is crazy.

5633
03:16:28,040 --> 03:16:29,860
That was so close, though.

5634
03:16:30,060 --> 03:16:31,140
That was so close.

5635
03:16:31,620 --> 03:16:33,380
Yeah, she wanted to jump.

5636
03:16:33,400 --> 03:16:34,100
She was burnt out.

5637
03:16:34,980 --> 03:16:35,400
Yeah.

5638
03:16:38,180 --> 03:16:39,460
That was a good set.

5639
03:16:39,560 --> 03:16:40,640
That was a really good set.

5640
03:16:40,760 --> 03:16:40,780
Yeah, yeah.

5641
03:16:42,820 --> 03:16:43,940
It was very close.

5642
03:16:44,660 --> 03:16:45,480
That was really good.

5643
03:16:45,580 --> 03:16:46,180
That was my bad.

5644
03:16:46,240 --> 03:16:46,660
I'm sorry.

5645
03:16:46,860 --> 03:16:47,880
I should have muted myself.

5646
03:16:48,100 --> 03:16:48,820
I said heavy punch.

5647
03:16:56,580 --> 03:16:57,380
You're cooking.

5648
03:16:57,900 --> 03:16:58,800
No, that was my bad.

5649
03:16:58,880 --> 03:16:59,920
Sunday's payback day.

5650
03:17:00,260 --> 03:17:03,440
I need a fucking Red Bull for this bullshit character, man.

5651
03:17:03,480 --> 03:17:04,860
Pop that Red Bull, Miko.

5652
03:17:06,440 --> 03:17:07,360
Get that caffeine.

5653
03:17:07,560 --> 03:17:08,720
Fuck Jamie, dude.

5654
03:17:09,340 --> 03:17:10,080
I hate Jamie.

5655
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:12,420
Remember the notes on this one, man.

5656
03:17:12,500 --> 03:17:13,960
Just use your stand medium.

5657
03:17:14,540 --> 03:17:16,340
Punch, stand medium kick, crouch medium kick.

5658
03:17:16,420 --> 03:17:18,100
And don't do the knee.

5659
03:17:18,240 --> 03:17:19,420
And just anti-air his ass.

5660
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:20,260
He's just a jumper.

5661
03:17:20,660 --> 03:17:21,680
Yeah, you gotta out-poke him.

5662
03:17:26,520 --> 03:17:27,660
Yeah, you're good.

5663
03:17:27,740 --> 03:17:27,860
Okay.

5664
03:17:32,920 --> 03:17:33,400
Ah,

5665
03:17:47,180 --> 03:17:47,560
fuck.

5666
03:17:49,920 --> 03:17:51,360
Oh, we went over that too.

5667
03:17:52,560 --> 03:17:54,140
Harness the power of the youth.

5668
03:17:56,200 --> 03:17:56,680
Believe.

5669
03:17:57,160 --> 03:17:57,660
Slap him.

5670
03:17:59,760 --> 03:18:00,720
Keep slapping.

5671
03:18:01,160 --> 03:18:01,880
Yeah, it's chill.

5672
03:18:01,940 --> 03:18:02,360
Just remember.

5673
03:18:02,640 --> 03:18:03,780
He's gotta just be in the air.

5674
03:18:03,880 --> 03:18:05,340
Just wait for that and there he is.

5675
03:18:05,840 --> 03:18:06,200
Okay.

5676
03:18:24,780 --> 03:18:27,000
Oh, I tried to jump and he does that.

5677
03:18:27,240 --> 03:18:28,360
Yeah, you can't jump there.

5678
03:18:30,140 --> 03:18:32,400
Ah, it's just so much to deal with.

5679
03:18:32,540 --> 03:18:33,760
I need an opening.

5680
03:18:36,120 --> 03:18:37,040
Oh, that's an opening?

5681
03:18:37,180 --> 03:18:37,300
Get him.

5682
03:18:37,300 --> 03:18:38,660
You heard your call.

5683
03:18:38,740 --> 03:18:39,480
Let's fucking go.

5684
03:18:39,580 --> 03:18:40,460
Time to party.

5685
03:18:40,920 --> 03:18:41,360
Nice.

5686
03:18:41,740 --> 03:18:42,280
Let's go.

5687
03:18:43,740 --> 03:18:44,180
Nice.

5688
03:18:46,360 --> 03:18:47,000
Fucking go!

5689
03:18:48,720 --> 03:18:50,660
I didn't fucking OD.

5690
03:18:50,800 --> 03:18:51,700
How did I not OD?

5691
03:18:53,080 --> 03:18:54,220
Oh, that was so close.

5692
03:18:55,140 --> 03:18:56,420
I thought I did, bro.

5693
03:18:57,320 --> 03:19:01,580
Okay, if you're staring him down from a distance too much, dry brush knee.

5694
03:19:01,800 --> 03:19:02,920
That's the only other thing you can do.

5695
03:19:03,180 --> 03:19:03,580
Okay, got it.

5696
03:19:03,580 --> 03:19:05,620
Other than that, use your post a little sparingly.

5697
03:19:05,620 --> 03:19:06,900
Don't mash the medium punch.

5698
03:19:08,900 --> 03:19:09,280
Okay.

5699
03:19:11,140 --> 03:19:11,760
There we go.

5700
03:19:11,920 --> 03:19:12,120
Nice.

5701
03:19:14,200 --> 03:19:14,880
We're getting it.

5702
03:19:15,780 --> 03:19:16,160
Nice.

5703
03:19:16,260 --> 03:19:16,900
We're getting it.

5704
03:19:18,200 --> 03:19:18,760
That's fine.

5705
03:19:18,860 --> 03:19:19,500
Don't worry about it.

5706
03:19:21,100 --> 03:19:21,480
Oh!

5707
03:19:21,520 --> 03:19:22,280
That's so good!

5708
03:19:23,020 --> 03:19:23,800
Okay, no knee.

5709
03:19:23,980 --> 03:19:25,040
Wow, that's really bad, huh?

5710
03:19:25,160 --> 03:19:26,500
You can use knee like that.

5711
03:19:26,780 --> 03:19:28,760
Just don't do it in neutral and just use a jumper.

5712
03:19:31,980 --> 03:19:32,480
That's fine.

5713
03:19:32,500 --> 03:19:32,940
He's burnt out.

5714
03:19:32,940 --> 03:19:33,160
Yeah.

5715
03:19:43,860 --> 03:19:44,180
Nice.

5716
03:19:44,780 --> 03:19:45,100
Nice.

5717
03:19:50,240 --> 03:19:50,560
Nice.

5718
03:19:56,060 --> 03:19:57,040
You're gonna be close to burn out.

5719
03:20:00,160 --> 03:20:00,480
Oh.

5720
03:20:01,580 --> 03:20:02,360
Good try, good try.

5721
03:20:02,420 --> 03:20:03,200
That was a good round, though.

5722
03:20:03,580 --> 03:20:04,560
That's the rhythm.

5723
03:20:05,620 --> 03:20:06,820
He's burning the matchup.

5724
03:20:15,130 --> 03:20:16,010
Nice.

5725
03:20:24,800 --> 03:20:26,280
Wow, that reached me.

5726
03:20:32,300 --> 03:20:33,180
Nice.

5727
03:20:40,280 --> 03:20:40,980
Okay.

5728
03:20:41,220 --> 03:20:41,620
Nice.

5729
03:20:49,840 --> 03:20:50,740
You got this.

5730
03:20:50,800 --> 03:20:52,220
Just hit him and don't let him hit you.

5731
03:20:52,380 --> 03:20:52,420
You got this.

5732
03:20:52,420 --> 03:20:52,420
Just hit him and don't let him hit you.

5733
03:20:52,420 --> 03:20:52,760
You got this.

5734
03:20:52,760 --> 03:20:52,760
Just hit him and don't let him hit you.

5735
03:20:53,240 --> 03:20:54,140
It's that easy.

5736
03:20:54,440 --> 03:20:54,600
It's that easy.

5737
03:20:54,700 --> 03:20:55,340
That's it.

5738
03:20:55,480 --> 03:20:55,900
I'm dead.

5739
03:20:56,500 --> 03:20:57,540
Am I dropped?

5740
03:20:58,860 --> 03:20:59,620
No, yeah.

5741
03:21:00,280 --> 03:21:01,300
Good try, man.

5742
03:21:01,420 --> 03:21:01,940
Good try.

5743
03:21:02,300 --> 03:21:03,020
Thanks, thanks.

5744
03:21:03,020 --> 03:21:03,440
It's hard.

5745
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:05,480
It's a hard matchup.

5746
03:21:05,680 --> 03:21:06,960
He's keeping his offense real clean.

5747
03:21:08,200 --> 03:21:11,540
There's not gonna be the traditional drops and gaps with this guy.

5748
03:21:12,020 --> 03:21:13,360
There's not gonna be the traditional drops and gaps with this guy.

5749
03:21:13,360 --> 03:21:15,880
He's playing nice, so you have to not let him get in.

5750
03:21:16,020 --> 03:21:17,060
You have to anti-arm him.

5751
03:21:17,100 --> 03:21:18,980
You have to convert your offense every time.

5752
03:21:19,020 --> 03:21:19,080
Yeah.

5753
03:21:19,960 --> 03:21:21,460
Guys, it's a tough one, man.

5754
03:21:21,920 --> 03:21:22,820
He's playing good.

5755
03:21:23,220 --> 03:21:25,100
That's better than a 1500 MR player.

5756
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:26,700
Swap him.

5757
03:21:26,800 --> 03:21:28,120
Swap him for the finals.

5758
03:21:30,740 --> 03:21:32,400
They can play the last seed.

5759
03:21:34,640 --> 03:21:36,820
Yeah, because I was like, I can take on that DJ.

5760
03:21:37,160 --> 03:21:37,860
Give me this DJ.

5761
03:21:39,260 --> 03:21:40,580
Make co-fight him.

5762
03:21:40,580 --> 03:21:42,080
That was my demon in the last slam.

5763
03:21:42,300 --> 03:21:43,020
I'm good, dude.

5764
03:21:43,600 --> 03:21:44,840
He's your problem now.

5765
03:21:44,920 --> 03:21:45,920
You had to fight his Jhin.

5766
03:21:46,280 --> 03:21:47,660
Yeah, I had to fight his Jhin.

5767
03:21:50,140 --> 03:21:51,400
Wait, why am I in the queue?

5768
03:21:52,060 --> 03:21:54,420
Wait, I thought you were a coach last slam.

5769
03:21:55,680 --> 03:21:56,500
Bro, bro, yeah.

5770
03:21:56,720 --> 03:21:57,120
Oh, me?

5771
03:21:57,480 --> 03:21:59,320
Yeah, you were coefficient.

5772
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:01,520
No, he was a player.

5773
03:22:02,860 --> 03:22:03,560
I'm dumb.

5774
03:22:03,880 --> 03:22:05,340
Oh my gosh.

5775
03:22:07,100 --> 03:22:08,540
There was no team coefficient?

5776
03:22:09,420 --> 03:22:09,860
No.

5777
03:22:10,580 --> 03:22:10,760
Really?

5778
03:22:11,040 --> 03:22:11,400
No.

5779
03:22:11,620 --> 03:22:12,040
What?

5780
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:16,340
It's okay.

5781
03:22:16,440 --> 03:22:18,440
Roy's team is last place on points or whatever.

5782
03:22:18,760 --> 03:22:19,500
I think.

5783
03:22:19,500 --> 03:22:19,880
I don't know.

5784
03:22:22,860 --> 03:22:24,260
Oh my gosh.

5785
03:22:24,920 --> 03:22:27,000
We've been in your backpack long enough, RallPro.

5786
03:22:28,680 --> 03:22:29,720
No, they're not.

5787
03:22:29,940 --> 03:22:30,620
They're four.

5788
03:22:31,740 --> 03:22:32,620
What do you mean?

5789
03:22:32,740 --> 03:22:33,480
We got it.

5790
03:22:33,620 --> 03:22:34,240
Let's go, Ko.

5791
03:22:41,470 --> 03:22:42,490
Come on, Ko.

5792
03:22:45,330 --> 03:22:45,730
Nice.

5793
03:22:50,960 --> 03:22:51,500
Oh, man.

5794
03:22:52,400 --> 03:22:53,220
Did that kill?

5795
03:22:53,420 --> 03:22:54,000
Oh, it does.

5796
03:22:54,060 --> 03:22:54,460
That's for sure.

5797
03:22:54,460 --> 03:22:55,360
Yeah, that was a good combo.

5798
03:22:56,800 --> 03:22:57,540
You're playing good.

5799
03:22:57,620 --> 03:22:57,860
Let's go.

5800
03:22:59,180 --> 03:22:59,860
You got this.

5801
03:23:03,220 --> 03:23:03,620
Nice.

5802
03:23:14,880 --> 03:23:15,880
Oh, that's fast.

5803
03:23:15,920 --> 03:23:16,620
He messed up his punish.

5804
03:23:17,800 --> 03:23:18,240
Let's go.

5805
03:23:19,240 --> 03:23:19,980
It's poison.

5806
03:23:20,280 --> 03:23:20,680
Yes.

5807
03:23:21,180 --> 03:23:22,280
Oh, another throw.

5808
03:23:22,680 --> 03:23:23,120
Nice.

5809
03:23:26,740 --> 03:23:27,980
Thought I could get it.

5810
03:23:28,120 --> 03:23:29,000
Oh my goodness.

5811
03:23:29,500 --> 03:23:31,400
That was a sick dub you did.

5812
03:23:49,650 --> 03:23:51,110
Ah, I didn't think he was going to cross over.

5813
03:23:51,330 --> 03:23:51,430
That's unlucky.

5814
03:23:51,790 --> 03:23:53,390
Yeah, that's the DV special.

5815
03:23:53,730 --> 03:23:54,730
It's always going to land in front.

5816
03:23:55,130 --> 03:23:55,570
Okay.

5817
03:23:57,610 --> 03:23:59,530
I mean, you don't see him.

5818
03:23:59,610 --> 03:24:00,970
You got your game plan.

5819
03:24:16,400 --> 03:24:17,220
Oh, god.

5820
03:24:17,300 --> 03:24:18,020
Holy shit.

5821
03:24:18,180 --> 03:24:18,740
How much...

5822
03:24:18,740 --> 03:24:20,240
DJ has a lot of offense.

5823
03:24:21,180 --> 03:24:21,700
Yeah.

5824
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:23,120
Holy...

5825
03:24:26,320 --> 03:24:27,660
Nice, you're out of the corner now.

5826
03:24:28,260 --> 03:24:28,780
Hmm.

5827
03:24:30,260 --> 03:24:30,780
Nevermind.

5828
03:24:31,860 --> 03:24:32,980
Yo, mid screen?

5829
03:24:33,340 --> 03:24:34,680
Try DI-ing this guy.

5830
03:24:34,780 --> 03:24:35,760
He's just fucking flailing.

5831
03:24:37,860 --> 03:24:39,300
Doing all that shit?

5832
03:24:39,460 --> 03:24:39,880
Like, yeah.

5833
03:24:44,560 --> 03:24:45,120
Nice.

5834
03:24:45,140 --> 03:24:45,500
Nice.

5835
03:24:45,620 --> 03:24:46,380
Good call.

5836
03:24:46,560 --> 03:24:47,920
He needs to slow down.

5837
03:24:48,580 --> 03:24:49,380
All good.

5838
03:24:50,660 --> 03:24:51,220
Nice.

5839
03:24:53,440 --> 03:24:54,300
Here we go.

5840
03:24:55,220 --> 03:24:56,280
Another grab.

5841
03:24:56,500 --> 03:24:58,020
Give him with that hunter special.

5842
03:24:58,720 --> 03:24:59,720
Oh, he learned.

5843
03:25:02,660 --> 03:25:03,960
Oh, that was sick.

5844
03:25:04,040 --> 03:25:04,640
That was sick.

5845
03:25:04,740 --> 03:25:05,300
Yeah.

5846
03:25:11,150 --> 03:25:12,170
Careful with your meter.

5847
03:25:13,130 --> 03:25:13,690
What?

5848
03:25:15,310 --> 03:25:15,690
Is that clean?

5849
03:25:16,710 --> 03:25:18,090
Oh, that was so...

5850
03:25:18,090 --> 03:25:18,730
That was barely.

5851
03:25:22,930 --> 03:25:23,530
Let's go.

5852
03:25:23,810 --> 03:25:24,310
Nice.

5853
03:25:24,690 --> 03:25:26,450
We take those.

5854
03:25:26,630 --> 03:25:27,510
Oh, that's intense.

5855
03:25:27,890 --> 03:25:30,850
Avoid burning yourself out if possible against DJ.

5856
03:25:45,840 --> 03:25:46,340
Okay.

5857
03:25:46,400 --> 03:25:46,840
Yeah.

5858
03:25:47,480 --> 03:25:48,720
That might be it there.

5859
03:25:49,020 --> 03:25:50,080
Yeah, it might be.

5860
03:25:50,260 --> 03:25:50,680
Yeah.

5861
03:25:51,260 --> 03:25:53,880
Ah, good try, good try.

5862
03:25:53,880 --> 03:25:54,820
Good try, man.

5863
03:25:55,080 --> 03:25:55,740
Offense game.

5864
03:25:55,980 --> 03:25:56,840
Oh, still alive.

5865
03:25:58,200 --> 03:25:59,540
Come back at the century.

5866
03:26:00,200 --> 03:26:01,500
Oh, so close.

5867
03:26:02,300 --> 03:26:04,540
Yeah, good try, man.

5868
03:26:04,700 --> 03:26:05,700
I have...

5869
03:26:05,700 --> 03:26:09,020
Yeah, I know that he was lapping this match super hard.

5870
03:26:09,160 --> 03:26:09,340
Yeah.

5871
03:26:10,060 --> 03:26:12,480
I ran into him a couple times in ranked.

5872
03:26:13,240 --> 03:26:14,700
And I beat him every time.

5873
03:26:14,800 --> 03:26:16,880
So I know he was lapping the shit out of this match.

5874
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:20,740
DJ's offense is just really good.

5875
03:26:20,860 --> 03:26:22,540
Like, you kind of have to stop him before it starts.

5876
03:26:22,540 --> 03:26:23,960
If you get cornered, it's almost over.

5877
03:26:23,960 --> 03:26:26,080
I was definitely playing a lot more defensively.

5878
03:26:26,100 --> 03:26:26,980
And I don't think I should have.

5879
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:29,520
Yeah, neutral, you kind of have to force it.

5880
03:26:29,620 --> 03:26:30,360
Like, that's why I said DI.

5881
03:26:30,640 --> 03:26:32,600
Like, you just got to go in and make it happen right away.

5882
03:26:32,780 --> 03:26:34,860
Because if you get cornered, then it's all downhill.

5883
03:26:35,100 --> 03:26:35,660
It's all right.

5884
03:26:35,660 --> 03:26:37,160
They're the worst performing team.

5885
03:26:37,500 --> 03:26:39,740
No, no, they're not.

5886
03:26:39,800 --> 03:26:40,880
They're fourth place.

5887
03:26:41,820 --> 03:26:42,700
Don't worry about it.

5888
03:26:42,700 --> 03:26:43,340
One of them.

5889
03:26:43,820 --> 03:26:45,720
Alright, let's get some more points.

5890
03:26:46,100 --> 03:26:50,420
We're doing the worst against the worst team.

5891
03:26:50,520 --> 03:26:51,140
They're the worst.

5892
03:26:51,180 --> 03:26:51,660
I don't care.

5893
03:26:52,540 --> 03:26:53,100
What makes us worse?

5894
03:26:53,400 --> 03:26:54,540
I'm just kidding.

5895
03:26:54,820 --> 03:26:56,180
I don't give a shit, dude!

5896
03:26:58,760 --> 03:26:59,660
Alright, alright.

5897
03:26:59,740 --> 03:27:01,540
DJ's gonna laugh against me, guys.

5898
03:27:01,660 --> 03:27:02,000
Please.

5899
03:27:05,640 --> 03:27:08,000
Yeah, you're definitely the person to beat now, Doki.

5900
03:27:08,760 --> 03:27:09,880
No pressure, though.

5901
03:27:10,400 --> 03:27:11,940
No, I can't.

5902
03:27:11,940 --> 03:27:12,720
I can't, guys.

5903
03:27:28,200 --> 03:27:30,120
Nice and obnoxious button, dude.

5904
03:27:34,500 --> 03:27:34,940
Okay.

5905
03:27:36,440 --> 03:27:37,660
Oh my god.

5906
03:27:37,660 --> 03:27:38,720
He just did it.

5907
03:27:39,980 --> 03:27:41,680
He's feeling a certain way today.

5908
03:27:42,280 --> 03:27:45,240
Man, Jamie players are such crazy nuts.

5909
03:27:47,340 --> 03:27:48,860
That's nicer than what I would have said.

5910
03:27:49,020 --> 03:27:50,040
But yeah, let's go with that.

5911
03:27:51,320 --> 03:27:52,520
I'm trying to keep it PG.

5912
03:27:53,440 --> 03:27:54,100
I know.

5913
03:27:54,180 --> 03:27:54,640
I'm JK.

5914
03:28:00,200 --> 03:28:00,900
Oh, Vic.

5915
03:28:01,700 --> 03:28:02,500
Oh my goodness.

5916
03:28:03,560 --> 03:28:03,920
Oh.

5917
03:28:05,940 --> 03:28:06,440
Oh, nice!

5918
03:28:06,460 --> 03:28:07,100
What is that?

5919
03:28:08,300 --> 03:28:09,280
Okay, he's burnt.

5920
03:28:09,420 --> 03:28:10,640
He has to get out, though.

5921
03:28:10,800 --> 03:28:11,620
Nice back dash!

5922
03:28:12,260 --> 03:28:13,240
To the corner!

5923
03:28:13,620 --> 03:28:14,680
Did he just kill?

5924
03:28:16,700 --> 03:28:17,780
Uh, I think...

5925
03:28:17,780 --> 03:28:19,560
Yeah, I think if he uses level 1, he can.

5926
03:28:21,560 --> 03:28:21,960
It's okay.

5927
03:28:22,300 --> 03:28:22,960
He's still burnt.

5928
03:28:23,400 --> 03:28:23,760
Nice!

5929
03:28:24,680 --> 03:28:25,040
Oh,

5930
03:28:35,950 --> 03:28:36,090
nice.

5931
03:28:37,610 --> 03:28:38,130
Time to party.

5932
03:28:39,270 --> 03:28:39,690
Blitz.

5933
03:28:41,610 --> 03:28:42,190
Uh-huh.

5934
03:28:43,070 --> 03:28:44,190
Don't be mashing on me, amigo.

5935
03:28:44,790 --> 03:28:45,750
Uh-uh-uh.

5936
03:28:46,530 --> 03:28:47,110
Safe jump.

5937
03:28:47,190 --> 03:28:49,470
Uh-uh-uh.

5938
03:28:49,510 --> 03:28:50,390
Don't be mashing on me, amigo.

5939
03:28:51,310 --> 03:28:52,150
Oh, yes!

5940
03:28:57,430 --> 03:28:59,310
Just barely built that with that meter.

5941
03:28:59,330 --> 03:28:59,870
I saw that.

5942
03:29:01,530 --> 03:29:02,890
Never underestimate me.

5943
03:29:05,370 --> 03:29:05,790
Jackpot!

5944
03:29:07,610 --> 03:29:07,850
Let's get it.

5945
03:29:08,790 --> 03:29:09,570
Let's get it!

5946
03:29:10,570 --> 03:29:11,030
Woo!

5947
03:29:17,770 --> 03:29:19,070
Nice jump, dude.

5948
03:29:20,250 --> 03:29:21,170
Stand still!

5949
03:29:21,490 --> 03:29:21,630
Oh!

5950
03:29:22,110 --> 03:29:22,570
Oh!

5951
03:29:22,810 --> 03:29:24,130
He dropped it.

5952
03:29:24,170 --> 03:29:24,530
He messed up.

5953
03:29:24,690 --> 03:29:27,310
It was a safe jump, so he couldn't really do much.

5954
03:29:27,630 --> 03:29:28,310
Oh, okay.

5955
03:29:40,200 --> 03:29:42,240
Oh, nice bait!

5956
03:29:43,040 --> 03:29:43,440
Nice!

5957
03:29:43,640 --> 03:29:44,220
Yeah, flicker!

5958
03:29:46,620 --> 03:29:47,420
Nice counter!

5959
03:29:48,320 --> 03:29:49,340
He's almost burnt out.

5960
03:29:49,640 --> 03:29:51,460
Oh, he burned himself out!

5961
03:29:51,480 --> 03:29:51,760
Let's go!

5962
03:29:52,100 --> 03:29:52,920
That's how you go!

5963
03:29:54,580 --> 03:29:55,080
He's scared now.

5964
03:29:55,080 --> 03:29:56,380
He has to look out for the level 1 now.

5965
03:29:57,600 --> 03:29:58,800
Oh, I can't believe that worked.

5966
03:29:59,200 --> 03:30:01,280
Oh, my goodness!

5967
03:30:02,580 --> 03:30:04,580
Yo, coach is playing real good today, bro.

5968
03:30:04,720 --> 03:30:05,080
He's so big, dude.

5969
03:30:09,400 --> 03:30:11,400
He's gonna salvage the points here, hopefully.

5970
03:30:13,360 --> 03:30:14,280
Nice punt.

5971
03:30:14,440 --> 03:30:14,960
Nice.

5972
03:30:15,400 --> 03:30:16,880
You're pissing me off!

5973
03:30:18,580 --> 03:30:19,720
It's so good, dude.

5974
03:30:20,500 --> 03:30:21,060
Woo!

5975
03:30:21,600 --> 03:30:22,480
Oh, the low!

5976
03:30:22,560 --> 03:30:23,860
Oh, my God!

5977
03:30:24,020 --> 03:30:24,660
Oh, my God!

5978
03:30:26,980 --> 03:30:27,720
Scrambled eggs!

5979
03:30:27,880 --> 03:30:28,240
Okay.

5980
03:30:30,720 --> 03:30:31,660
Back to neutral.

5981
03:30:36,240 --> 03:30:37,780
Oh, my God!

5982
03:30:38,720 --> 03:30:39,280
Let's go!

5983
03:30:39,280 --> 03:30:39,560
Yeah!

5984
03:30:40,120 --> 03:30:41,080
Almost clean.

5985
03:30:41,680 --> 03:30:46,780
Guys, okay, because of that, we're on a three-way tie with Nephew and Shine.

5986
03:30:47,260 --> 03:30:48,260
No shot.

5987
03:30:48,400 --> 03:30:48,740
Yeah.

5988
03:30:48,840 --> 03:30:49,620
There's no way.

5989
03:30:50,760 --> 03:30:51,280
Yeah.

5990
03:30:51,860 --> 03:30:53,800
Do we have to play the...

5991
03:30:53,800 --> 03:30:55,080
Yeah, the coaches have to play.

5992
03:30:56,000 --> 03:30:57,760
No, dude, hold on.

5993
03:30:57,780 --> 03:30:58,720
We need auditors.

5994
03:30:58,840 --> 03:30:59,960
The other two coaches?

5995
03:31:00,360 --> 03:31:03,440
We all have 119 points.

5996
03:31:03,560 --> 03:31:04,440
I don't either.

5997
03:31:04,780 --> 03:31:05,940
We don't know how to match.

5998
03:31:05,940 --> 03:31:10,300
Because Nephew's coach won against Shine's team, so they got another five points.

5999
03:31:11,040 --> 03:31:13,800
So now we have a three-way tie.

6000
03:31:15,700 --> 03:31:18,240
But what about with Brian's match?

6001
03:31:18,240 --> 03:31:21,100
It'll be 119, 119...

6002
03:31:22,560 --> 03:31:24,040
So no, how is it a three-way?

6003
03:31:25,120 --> 03:31:27,520
119, it's Nephew, Shine, and us.

6004
03:31:28,540 --> 03:31:30,100
Oh, so Nephew won, you're saying?

6005
03:31:30,200 --> 03:31:35,160
Yeah, Nephew got the coach win, so because of that, they tied it up with Shine.

6006
03:31:36,060 --> 03:31:36,800
Oh, shit.

6007
03:31:37,000 --> 03:31:38,940
So does that matter?

6008
03:31:39,180 --> 03:31:41,520
Do we need to... I guess we do have to...

6009
03:31:41,520 --> 03:31:43,100
They're gonna make us replay.

6010
03:31:43,800 --> 03:31:47,720
So they're gonna make you guys play, and you have to beat both of them.

6011
03:31:48,720 --> 03:31:50,760
Like, what are we exactly doing here?

6012
03:31:50,760 --> 03:31:56,500
The first one, apparently the first one to win against the other two coaches is the one that gets to win.

6013
03:31:56,500 --> 03:31:58,400
Oh my god, I should've beat Roy, dude.

6014
03:31:58,560 --> 03:32:01,220
I should've beat freaking Bald Icon!

6015
03:32:01,360 --> 03:32:02,120
Damn it!

6016
03:32:02,740 --> 03:32:03,940
I did my job.

6017
03:32:08,000 --> 03:32:09,960
We all did our job today.

6018
03:32:10,340 --> 03:32:11,740
We all did our job.

6019
03:32:12,720 --> 03:32:15,780
We went from tied for third to tied for third.

6020
03:32:16,200 --> 03:32:17,180
Yeah, we're all tied.

6021
03:32:18,420 --> 03:32:20,560
We won more sets, though.

6022
03:32:20,800 --> 03:32:23,120
Like, we lost less the least amount of sets.

6023
03:32:23,580 --> 03:32:27,240
Like, Shine's team lost one set more than us.

6024
03:32:27,900 --> 03:32:28,840
Yeah, there it is.

6025
03:32:28,980 --> 03:32:29,700
Three-way tie.

6026
03:32:30,200 --> 03:32:32,880
Are they judging by sets, too, or...?

6027
03:32:33,860 --> 03:32:37,680
I think they're just doing points, because the whole idea is that the sets today are worth more.

6028
03:32:37,920 --> 03:32:38,480
That's the idea.

6029
03:32:38,480 --> 03:32:39,540
There is actually a three-way tie.

6030
03:32:39,620 --> 03:32:40,120
That is nice.

6031
03:32:40,180 --> 03:32:40,580
Yeah.

6032
03:32:40,620 --> 03:32:41,540
Oh, god.

6033
03:32:41,780 --> 03:32:42,960
I'm sorry, Brian.

6034
03:32:43,420 --> 03:32:44,320
That is crazy.

6035
03:32:45,880 --> 03:32:46,600
All right.

6036
03:32:46,600 --> 03:32:48,080
I mean, it's time to put on the big boy pants.

6037
03:32:48,480 --> 03:32:49,320
Yeah, all right.

6038
03:32:49,480 --> 03:32:51,320
This is major focus time.

6039
03:32:51,440 --> 03:32:52,100
I'm not talking.

6040
03:32:52,160 --> 03:32:52,760
I'm muting.

6041
03:32:53,080 --> 03:32:53,680
All right.

6042
03:32:55,120 --> 03:33:01,120
I mean, I like the whole, like, cheer like you're the background in Smash Brothers kind of aspect.

6043
03:33:01,740 --> 03:33:02,740
That's my favorite part.

6044
03:33:02,880 --> 03:33:03,080
All right.

6045
03:33:03,120 --> 03:33:03,540
Sounds good.

6046
03:33:03,560 --> 03:33:05,800
Don't philosophically get into the definition of neutral.

6047
03:33:10,740 --> 03:33:11,540
Sounds good.

6048
03:33:11,700 --> 03:33:13,760
Oh, my god, dude.

6049
03:33:15,060 --> 03:33:15,460
Well...

6050
03:33:15,460 --> 03:33:16,440
That's going to haunt me, dude.

6051
03:33:16,460 --> 03:33:19,600
Bro, you got to fucking blab against Roy.

6052
03:33:21,020 --> 03:33:23,300
Just tell Roy, hey, Roy, why don't you do some sets?

6053
03:33:23,340 --> 03:33:23,880
No reason.

6054
03:33:23,920 --> 03:33:26,460
You, Ko, or SK are, like, the deciding factor.

6055
03:33:28,120 --> 03:33:29,580
Dude, he's tough, man.

6056
03:33:29,820 --> 03:33:30,860
I don't know what you're doing.

6057
03:33:30,860 --> 03:33:31,880
I'm going to go get some water, guys.

6058
03:33:31,880 --> 03:33:33,040
Let me know what they figure out.

6059
03:33:33,560 --> 03:33:34,000
Okay.

6060
03:33:35,260 --> 03:33:35,720
All right.

6061
03:33:35,800 --> 03:33:36,240
He's so good.

6062
03:33:36,660 --> 03:33:37,100
Damn.

6063
03:33:37,540 --> 03:33:41,820
I did my job so I can chill now.

6064
03:33:43,940 --> 03:33:44,780
That's all chill.

6065
03:33:46,320 --> 03:33:48,880
But everybody's going to lab against me, so I don't know what to do.

6066
03:33:53,720 --> 03:33:54,600
Oh, man.

6067
03:33:55,080 --> 03:33:57,240
The slams are so stressful, dude.

6068
03:33:57,520 --> 03:33:58,120
But they're fun.

6069
03:33:58,200 --> 03:33:58,440
I can't believe how...

6070
03:33:58,440 --> 03:34:01,040
I've been to, like, many tournaments before.

6071
03:34:01,040 --> 03:34:04,140
And, God, dude, this is something else, let me tell you.

6072
03:34:04,740 --> 03:34:05,140
Yeah.

6073
03:34:06,540 --> 03:34:08,660
I've hit my zone minutes twice today.

6074
03:34:08,980 --> 03:34:09,380
Goddamn.

6075
03:34:10,160 --> 03:34:10,560
Yay.

6076
03:34:13,300 --> 03:34:13,700
Wow.

6077
03:34:14,240 --> 03:34:15,340
Yeah, Doki did real good.

6078
03:34:15,480 --> 03:34:15,900
Yeah, she did.

6079
03:34:16,020 --> 03:34:16,260
She did.

6080
03:34:16,360 --> 03:34:17,200
I did my job.

6081
03:34:17,460 --> 03:34:20,500
I'm the only beginner that 5-0'd out of the two days.

6082
03:34:21,180 --> 03:34:21,580
Yeah.

6083
03:34:23,060 --> 03:34:24,700
They're going to practice hard, though.

6084
03:34:24,720 --> 03:34:26,020
They're going to practice hard against Keith.

6085
03:34:26,040 --> 03:34:26,260
Yeah.

6086
03:34:26,320 --> 03:34:27,040
No, I'm fucked.

6087
03:34:28,600 --> 03:34:29,000
Nice.

6088
03:34:29,500 --> 03:34:29,900
Nice.

6089
03:34:31,060 --> 03:34:36,840
Something good for SK is if she practices against Ken, that's two of her players that play that character.

6090
03:34:37,020 --> 03:34:37,340
Yeah.

6091
03:34:37,340 --> 03:34:37,680
That's true.

6092
03:34:37,780 --> 03:34:38,180
That's smart.

6093
03:34:38,400 --> 03:34:38,560
True.

6094
03:34:39,340 --> 03:34:41,180
I lost everything 1-2.

6095
03:34:42,240 --> 03:34:42,720
Yeah.

6096
03:34:42,720 --> 03:34:43,240
And they're all close.

6097
03:34:43,320 --> 03:34:45,880
I just need to get better, and then I will win everything.

6098
03:34:46,940 --> 03:34:47,600
That's right.

6099
03:34:47,720 --> 03:34:48,000
Yeah.

6100
03:34:48,020 --> 03:34:48,280
Yeah.

6101
03:34:48,460 --> 03:34:49,640
That is very true.

6102
03:34:57,920 --> 03:35:02,880
And the Automatic team, oh, so they are, like, not last.

6103
03:35:03,260 --> 03:35:05,720
Diaphones and JB's is last.

6104
03:35:05,720 --> 03:35:06,020
Yeah.

6105
03:35:06,040 --> 03:35:07,100
Yeah, that's what I've been saying.

6106
03:35:07,120 --> 03:35:08,200
I kept saying that.

6107
03:35:08,200 --> 03:35:08,620
Oh, nice.

6108
03:35:08,620 --> 03:35:09,880
Which is fucking annoying.

6109
03:35:09,940 --> 03:35:11,800
Dude, they could be the first team.

6110
03:35:11,840 --> 03:35:11,860
He needs to lock in.

6111
03:35:12,180 --> 03:35:16,460
They could be the first in the leaderboards, and I'd still call them the worst team.

6112
03:35:16,540 --> 03:35:16,840
No.

6113
03:35:16,900 --> 03:35:18,080
Team Jamie, no.

6114
03:35:18,220 --> 03:35:18,980
I don't think so.

6115
03:35:19,220 --> 03:35:19,900
I know.

6116
03:35:19,940 --> 03:35:23,360
And the thing with Roy is his coach mains the character he's using, too.

6117
03:35:23,460 --> 03:35:24,740
That kind of sucks to ask.

6118
03:35:26,400 --> 03:35:28,520
And so, okay, here's the thing.

6119
03:35:28,560 --> 03:35:34,380
If we, this tiebreaker, whoever gets third will have to play Team Auto, right?

6120
03:35:34,540 --> 03:35:34,800
Yeah.

6121
03:35:34,800 --> 03:35:36,200
I don't know.

6122
03:35:36,260 --> 03:35:38,400
We'll have to fight Auto, because they're at the fourth place.

6123
03:35:38,720 --> 03:35:46,360
If Bryan, like, loses to both the coaches, then at, I think, Sunday, we'll have to fight that Jamie team in the bracket.

6124
03:35:46,360 --> 03:35:47,500
Yeah, we're fighting Auto's team.

6125
03:35:48,740 --> 03:35:52,360
If Bryan loses both the coaching matches.

6126
03:35:52,380 --> 03:35:56,940
If he wins one of them, we fight, like, Phones' team.

6127
03:35:58,140 --> 03:35:58,660
Yeah.

6128
03:35:58,820 --> 03:36:00,100
Or JB's.

6129
03:36:00,300 --> 03:36:04,780
No, JB's going to be fighting whoever wins two.

6130
03:36:04,780 --> 03:36:05,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6131
03:36:05,700 --> 03:36:06,000
Yep.

6132
03:36:06,340 --> 03:36:08,960
So, it's Nephew and Shine.

6133
03:36:10,180 --> 03:36:10,540
So...

6134
03:36:10,540 --> 03:36:10,820
All right.

6135
03:36:11,440 --> 03:36:13,880
If we get one win, we get to fight Phones.

6136
03:36:17,180 --> 03:36:19,940
Three-way round robin for tiebreaker invite incoming hostess.

6137
03:36:19,940 --> 03:36:20,740
Okay, I got to...

6138
03:36:20,740 --> 03:36:21,340
Oh, that's...

6139
03:36:21,340 --> 03:36:21,720
Oh, I'm here.

6140
03:36:21,820 --> 03:36:22,200
All right.

6141
03:36:22,200 --> 03:36:23,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

6142
03:36:23,440 --> 03:36:23,780
Wait, no.

6143
03:36:23,800 --> 03:36:24,020
Hostess...

6144
03:36:24,020 --> 03:36:24,800
Where can we watch it?

6145
03:36:25,900 --> 03:36:26,480
The mainstream?

6146
03:36:26,760 --> 03:36:27,120
Or...

6147
03:36:27,120 --> 03:36:27,680
I guess stream.

6148
03:36:27,880 --> 03:36:29,080
Can we go in?

6149
03:36:29,200 --> 03:36:31,300
You can watch my stream, but it's going to be delayed a little.

6150
03:36:31,600 --> 03:36:31,960
Wait.

6151
03:36:31,960 --> 03:36:33,000
I'm not going to invite us.

6152
03:36:36,320 --> 03:36:37,240
I'm going in.

6153
03:36:37,340 --> 03:36:37,680
Oh, no.

6154
03:36:37,760 --> 03:36:38,360
That's not it.

6155
03:36:39,760 --> 03:36:40,160
No.

6156
03:36:42,060 --> 03:36:42,700
All right.

6157
03:36:42,740 --> 03:36:44,500
I'll just watch Seijan's stream.

6158
03:36:45,200 --> 03:36:45,600
Okay.

6159
03:36:45,760 --> 03:36:46,160
Yeah.

6160
03:36:47,920 --> 03:36:49,800
And join Seijan's stream and...

6161
03:36:49,800 --> 03:36:51,360
Well, you can watch my stream.

6162
03:36:51,380 --> 03:36:55,480
If you want to react without me deafening, my stream will be the least delayed.

6163
03:36:56,200 --> 03:36:56,600
Okay.

6164
03:36:56,900 --> 03:36:59,700
So, it'll make the most sense to me if you react to my stream.

6165
03:37:00,760 --> 03:37:01,160
Okay.

6166
03:37:01,220 --> 03:37:01,720
Let's do it.

6167
03:37:01,820 --> 03:37:02,860
But then, if I...

6168
03:37:02,860 --> 03:37:02,980
All right.

6169
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:03,660
I won't talk.

6170
03:37:03,660 --> 03:37:04,700
If you want to.

6171
03:37:04,940 --> 03:37:05,500
That's all right.

6172
03:37:05,580 --> 03:37:06,380
You're deafening, right?

6173
03:37:08,940 --> 03:37:10,260
I don't have to.

6174
03:37:11,340 --> 03:37:13,540
I'm just going to keep it to the match only.

6175
03:37:13,740 --> 03:37:14,540
Hype moments.

6176
03:37:14,700 --> 03:37:15,140
That's it.

6177
03:37:15,700 --> 03:37:16,140
Yeah.

6178
03:37:16,160 --> 03:37:16,480
Me too.

6179
03:37:16,560 --> 03:37:18,720
No philosophical neutral discussions.

6180
03:37:19,100 --> 03:37:19,660
I promise.

6181
03:37:19,700 --> 03:37:21,980
We'll be like the crowd behind you when you're playing a tournament.

6182
03:37:22,240 --> 03:37:22,900
Hell yeah.

6183
03:37:23,300 --> 03:37:23,740
Yippee.

6184
03:37:24,940 --> 03:37:25,380
Yay.

6185
03:37:28,340 --> 03:37:30,120
Except when they root for you to lose.

6186
03:37:30,300 --> 03:37:30,740
No.

6187
03:37:30,900 --> 03:37:31,400
Oh, no.

6188
03:37:32,060 --> 03:37:32,900
That's not fun.

6189
03:37:35,660 --> 03:37:36,640
Part of the game.

6190
03:37:38,420 --> 03:37:40,020
I mean, we do fight auto.

6191
03:37:40,720 --> 03:37:43,440
At best, all of us just need to lab against all the characters.

6192
03:37:44,380 --> 03:37:51,460
They said in the chat where this is happening, which is stage two, they said react if you want an invite.

6193
03:37:52,960 --> 03:37:53,400
Oh.

6194
03:37:54,320 --> 03:37:55,740
Where the fuck is stage two?

6195
03:37:55,880 --> 03:37:55,980
Oh.

6196
03:37:56,500 --> 03:37:57,320
I'm reacting.

6197
03:37:57,560 --> 03:37:57,860
I'm reacting.

6198
03:37:57,860 --> 03:37:59,700
There's only 16 spots in any of the lobbies.

6199
03:37:59,760 --> 03:38:00,220
Come on.

6200
03:38:00,340 --> 03:38:00,640
Yeah.

6201
03:38:00,660 --> 03:38:00,960
Well.

6202
03:38:01,140 --> 03:38:01,380
Come on.

6203
03:38:01,900 --> 03:38:02,300
Yeah.

6204
03:38:02,320 --> 03:38:03,300
I'm just going to watch.

6205
03:38:06,140 --> 03:38:08,580
Honestly, if you watch my stream, it might be less delayed.

6206
03:38:08,800 --> 03:38:09,640
It's in stage two.

6207
03:38:10,720 --> 03:38:11,480
Stage two.

6208
03:38:11,540 --> 03:38:12,680
Ned versus Brian first.

6209
03:38:13,800 --> 03:38:14,440
All right.

6210
03:38:17,280 --> 03:38:18,180
They said that?

6211
03:38:18,260 --> 03:38:19,100
Ned versus Brian first?

6212
03:38:19,140 --> 03:38:19,420
Winner first?

6213
03:38:19,500 --> 03:38:19,900
Yeah.

6214
03:38:19,900 --> 03:38:20,580
They did say that.

6215
03:38:20,660 --> 03:38:20,780
Okay.

6216
03:38:20,800 --> 03:38:21,280
Stage two.

6217
03:38:21,400 --> 03:38:23,920
And then I guess all you guys fight each other once, right?

6218
03:38:25,200 --> 03:38:25,600
Yeah.

6219
03:38:25,640 --> 03:38:26,580
I think that's the idea.

6220
03:38:26,760 --> 03:38:27,020
Yeah.

6221
03:38:27,040 --> 03:38:27,580
Because it's a tie.

6222
03:38:27,880 --> 03:38:28,480
All right.

6223
03:38:28,980 --> 03:38:30,040
Is it two out of three?

6224
03:38:30,440 --> 03:38:31,280
I think it is.

6225
03:38:31,360 --> 03:38:31,580
Okay.

6226
03:38:31,640 --> 03:38:32,860
We're starting now, guys.

6227
03:38:33,100 --> 03:38:33,500
They didn't send me the invite.

6228
03:38:33,500 --> 03:38:33,960
You got this.

6229
03:38:34,060 --> 03:38:34,700
All right.

6230
03:38:34,700 --> 03:38:35,000
All right.

6231
03:38:35,000 --> 03:38:35,220
Amigo.

6232
03:38:50,340 --> 03:38:51,140
All right.

6233
03:38:51,160 --> 03:38:52,120
I'm watching on Brian's stream.

6234
03:38:52,420 --> 03:38:52,780
Yeah.

6235
03:38:52,840 --> 03:38:53,040
Me too.

6236
03:38:53,040 --> 03:38:53,700
I think I'm going to do the same.

6237
03:38:53,840 --> 03:38:54,800
They didn't send me the invite.

6238
03:38:56,040 --> 03:38:56,640
Me too.

6239
03:38:57,380 --> 03:38:58,300
They just started.

6240
03:38:58,400 --> 03:38:59,160
It's in 97.

6241
03:38:59,720 --> 03:39:00,120
96.

6242
03:39:00,920 --> 03:39:01,320
95.

6243
03:40:20,590 --> 03:40:20,990
Hmm.

6244
03:40:22,870 --> 03:40:23,270
Okay.

6245
03:40:23,750 --> 03:40:24,830
What is that grab?

6246
03:40:25,010 --> 03:40:25,410
Dude.

6247
03:40:25,610 --> 03:40:26,610
I hate jury.

6248
03:40:26,870 --> 03:40:27,030
That grab is crazy.

6249
03:40:27,030 --> 03:40:27,430
What the hell?

6250
03:40:27,550 --> 03:40:27,790
Yeah.

6251
03:40:27,910 --> 03:40:28,310
Dude.

6252
03:40:28,390 --> 03:40:29,270
I hate it, dude.

6253
03:40:29,350 --> 03:40:30,490
That throw loop is insane.

6254
03:40:30,570 --> 03:40:30,870
You got it.

6255
03:40:31,890 --> 03:40:32,890
That grab.

6256
03:40:33,310 --> 03:40:34,170
So good.

6257
03:40:34,590 --> 03:40:35,630
You got this.

6258
03:40:37,090 --> 03:40:37,950
Adapting time.

6259
03:41:25,290 --> 03:41:25,870
Nice.

6260
03:41:25,870 --> 03:41:26,770
Perfect parry.

6261
03:41:26,790 --> 03:41:27,530
Punish, dude.

6262
03:41:28,830 --> 03:41:29,410
Oh.

6263
03:41:33,300 --> 03:41:35,380
That grab is so obnoxious.

6264
03:41:36,280 --> 03:41:36,860
Yeah.

6265
03:41:36,880 --> 03:41:37,200
Yeah.

6266
03:41:37,200 --> 03:41:37,900
It's really good.

6267
03:41:39,480 --> 03:41:41,280
I hate that even as a gif.

6268
03:41:41,520 --> 03:41:42,100
Oh.

6269
03:41:42,100 --> 03:41:42,640
Oh.

6270
03:41:42,720 --> 03:41:42,880
Oh.

6271
03:41:42,880 --> 03:41:43,200
Oh.

6272
03:41:43,360 --> 03:41:44,160
Here we go.

6273
03:41:44,260 --> 03:41:44,680
Yes.

6274
03:41:44,900 --> 03:41:45,540
Let's go.

6275
03:41:45,840 --> 03:41:46,060
Let's go.

6276
03:41:47,760 --> 03:41:48,720
Come on, coach.

6277
03:41:48,800 --> 03:41:49,100
Let's go.

6278
03:41:49,200 --> 03:41:49,580
Oh.

6279
03:42:18,660 --> 03:42:19,960
That stupid grab.

6280
03:42:20,520 --> 03:42:21,620
The loops, man.

6281
03:42:21,800 --> 03:42:22,020
Yeah.

6282
03:42:23,100 --> 03:42:23,640
Dang it.

6283
03:42:24,740 --> 03:42:25,300
It's all right.

6284
03:42:25,300 --> 03:42:25,500
All right.

6285
03:42:25,560 --> 03:42:25,960
Composure.

6286
03:42:26,040 --> 03:42:26,460
No worries.

6287
03:42:40,610 --> 03:42:41,010
Nice.

6288
03:42:41,630 --> 03:42:42,030
Okay.

6289
03:42:43,290 --> 03:42:43,870
Here we go.

6290
03:42:43,950 --> 03:42:44,890
You're pissing me off.

6291
03:42:45,230 --> 03:42:45,630
Okay.

6292
03:42:45,710 --> 03:42:45,830
Yeah.

6293
03:42:45,850 --> 03:42:46,050
Yeah.

6294
03:42:46,050 --> 03:42:46,530
There you go.

6295
03:42:46,730 --> 03:42:47,130
Yeah.

6296
03:42:47,210 --> 03:42:47,790
Piss him off.

6297
03:42:47,890 --> 03:42:47,910
That's good.

6298
03:42:47,910 --> 03:42:48,850
Build some drive gauge back.

6299
03:42:49,030 --> 03:42:49,410
That's good.

6300
03:42:49,450 --> 03:42:49,670
Yeah.

6301
03:42:49,750 --> 03:42:50,650
Piss him off.

6302
03:42:52,610 --> 03:42:53,010
Okay.

6303
03:42:53,170 --> 03:42:53,490
Okay.

6304
03:42:55,490 --> 03:42:56,130
Idiot jump.

6305
03:43:01,170 --> 03:43:02,150
Still in this.

6306
03:43:13,730 --> 03:43:15,110
Oh my God.

6307
03:43:16,190 --> 03:43:17,270
It's all good.

6308
03:43:17,410 --> 03:43:18,130
All right.

6309
03:43:18,310 --> 03:43:19,270
All right.

6310
03:43:19,270 --> 03:43:19,690
No worries.

6311
03:43:19,810 --> 03:43:21,570
We still have the Rasheed match.

6312
03:43:21,670 --> 03:43:22,150
So no worries.

6313
03:43:22,710 --> 03:43:24,230
These throws, man.

6314
03:43:24,330 --> 03:43:25,330
Jury just gets into...

6315
03:43:25,330 --> 03:43:27,950
Dude, that shit is obnoxious to watch.

6316
03:43:28,050 --> 03:43:28,530
Yeah.

6317
03:43:28,530 --> 03:43:28,850
Yeah.

6318
03:43:28,850 --> 03:43:30,070
It's obnoxious, dude.

6319
03:43:30,110 --> 03:43:30,350
Yeah.

6320
03:43:30,350 --> 03:43:31,950
Jury is not fun to fight.

6321
03:43:32,370 --> 03:43:33,270
Yeah, dude.

6322
03:43:33,510 --> 03:43:34,890
But that's what makes her good.

6323
03:43:35,170 --> 03:43:35,690
Yeah.

6324
03:43:35,690 --> 03:43:36,870
So what is the idea now?

6325
03:43:37,950 --> 03:43:38,690
I don't know.

6326
03:43:38,750 --> 03:43:40,190
I think we can wait for the next one.

6327
03:43:40,810 --> 03:43:45,790
Nephew is going to fight Rasheed, and then I guess whoever loses it will fight you.

6328
03:43:45,850 --> 03:43:47,230
It's the Kim player.

6329
03:43:47,390 --> 03:43:47,590
Kim.

6330
03:43:47,670 --> 03:43:47,810
Yeah.

6331
03:43:47,830 --> 03:43:48,530
Oh, the Kim player.

6332
03:43:48,570 --> 03:43:49,650
Rasheed, not the Rasheed player.

6333
03:43:49,910 --> 03:43:50,590
Oh, I thought it was Rasheed.

6334
03:43:50,590 --> 03:43:51,190
No, that's JB.

6335
03:43:51,490 --> 03:43:51,830
He's...

6336
03:43:51,830 --> 03:43:52,670
Oh, okay.

6337
03:43:52,750 --> 03:43:56,030
So say there's a 1-1 tie.

6338
03:43:56,170 --> 03:43:56,910
What happens there?

6339
03:43:57,070 --> 03:43:58,130
I think you just keep going.

6340
03:43:58,390 --> 03:43:58,830
I don't know.

6341
03:43:58,910 --> 03:43:59,510
You keep going?

6342
03:43:59,510 --> 03:43:59,990
You keep going, bro.

6343
03:43:59,990 --> 03:44:01,730
Because it doesn't make sense for...

6344
03:44:01,730 --> 03:44:03,430
Because everybody tied up.

6345
03:44:03,490 --> 03:44:04,270
So it doesn't make sense to have...

6346
03:44:04,270 --> 03:44:05,030
Oh, Shining and CPT.

6347
03:44:05,170 --> 03:44:06,030
Oh my God.

6348
03:44:06,630 --> 03:44:07,310
Well, this is...

6349
03:44:07,310 --> 03:44:08,030
This is going off the rails.

6350
03:44:08,030 --> 03:44:08,830
This is...

6351
03:44:08,830 --> 03:44:09,490
This is going nuts.

6352
03:44:09,790 --> 03:44:10,230
Oh, no.

6353
03:44:10,410 --> 03:44:12,590
They should make him forfeit because he can't show up.

6354
03:44:12,870 --> 03:44:13,310
Yes.

6355
03:44:13,910 --> 03:44:14,350
Oh.

6356
03:44:14,430 --> 03:44:14,550
Okay.

6357
03:44:14,590 --> 03:44:16,890
I guess now what we all do...

6358
03:44:16,890 --> 03:44:18,190
Oh, that's what...

6359
03:44:18,190 --> 03:44:19,090
Sajam's streaming.

6360
03:44:19,190 --> 03:44:19,390
Okay.

6361
03:44:20,530 --> 03:44:20,970
Okay.

6362
03:44:21,050 --> 03:44:21,850
Sajam's streaming.

6363
03:44:21,930 --> 03:44:22,530
Shine's stream.

6364
03:44:22,750 --> 03:44:23,950
Oh, so we just wait and...

6365
03:44:23,950 --> 03:44:26,530
Dude, I'm just going to see your stream of him...

6366
03:44:26,530 --> 03:44:28,970
Sajam seeing Shine's stream.

6367
03:44:29,470 --> 03:44:30,650
We got stream exception.

6368
03:44:31,450 --> 03:44:32,790
There's too much going on here.

6369
03:44:33,110 --> 03:44:33,550
Yeah.

6370
03:44:33,630 --> 03:44:36,030
So Sajam watching this.

6371
03:44:36,050 --> 03:44:36,270
DEQ.

6372
03:44:36,430 --> 03:44:36,750
DEQ.

6373
03:44:37,070 --> 03:44:37,710
This is...

6374
03:44:38,030 --> 03:44:38,450
So...

6375
03:44:38,950 --> 03:44:40,050
Doing so fucking much.

6376
03:44:40,050 --> 03:44:40,470
People were saying that...

6377
03:44:40,470 --> 03:44:41,710
This tournament's very important that he's in.

6378
03:44:41,970 --> 03:44:44,590
It resets if Nephew loses the next one.

6379
03:44:46,590 --> 03:44:47,810
Ah, I see.

6380
03:44:47,810 --> 03:44:50,570
So whoever wins two of them gets to be first.

6381
03:44:51,630 --> 03:44:52,910
Well, whoever wins...

6382
03:44:52,910 --> 03:44:53,990
No, they'll just play me.

6383
03:44:54,110 --> 03:44:54,530
Whoever...

6384
03:44:54,530 --> 03:44:55,510
If someone gets to...

6385
03:44:55,930 --> 03:45:01,030
Like, if I lose both, then it's over for that person or in general.

6386
03:45:01,090 --> 03:45:01,250
Yeah.

6387
03:45:01,250 --> 03:45:02,490
So if I win one, it's going to be tied.

6388
03:45:02,870 --> 03:45:03,310
Yeah.

6389
03:45:03,390 --> 03:45:04,310
And they'll have to keep playing.

6390
03:45:08,260 --> 03:45:09,660
So basically, it's all up to Shine.

6391
03:45:09,660 --> 03:45:10,220
Yeah.

6392
03:45:10,460 --> 03:45:10,860
Yeah.

6393
03:45:11,240 --> 03:45:11,960
Pretty much.

6394
03:45:12,240 --> 03:45:14,700
Dude, I can't believe he's playing in this tournament and doing...

6395
03:45:15,640 --> 03:45:16,500
That's a lot, man.

6396
03:45:16,740 --> 03:45:17,020
Yeah.

6397
03:45:17,080 --> 03:45:18,600
Like, this tournament is super...

6398
03:45:19,460 --> 03:45:20,040
It's important.

6399
03:45:20,300 --> 03:45:22,860
Like, one of the hardest tournaments in the world, what he's doing right now.

6400
03:45:22,940 --> 03:45:23,700
The online one?

6401
03:45:24,140 --> 03:45:24,540
Yeah.

6402
03:45:24,700 --> 03:45:26,000
Is this specifically NA?

6403
03:45:26,520 --> 03:45:27,260
This is for...

6404
03:45:27,260 --> 03:45:29,920
This is NA East, which is one of the most stacked regions.

6405
03:45:30,020 --> 03:45:31,640
So it had Punk and Mena in it before.

6406
03:45:31,820 --> 03:45:32,540
Oh, this is weird.

6407
03:45:32,580 --> 03:45:33,440
They don't enter anymore.

6408
03:45:33,660 --> 03:45:33,680
Top eight.

6409
03:45:34,840 --> 03:45:35,240
So...

6410
03:45:35,240 --> 03:45:35,760
Oh my gosh.

6411
03:45:35,760 --> 03:45:37,480
Whoever wins this goes to top eight.

6412
03:45:37,480 --> 03:45:37,600
Oh, they got it.

6413
03:45:38,520 --> 03:45:39,000
Yeah.

6414
03:45:39,060 --> 03:45:39,900
So they want points.

6415
03:45:40,040 --> 03:45:40,560
Who the hell's in West Coast then?

6416
03:45:41,000 --> 03:45:42,580
West Coast is Nephew.

6417
03:45:42,780 --> 03:45:45,840
Nephew players like Noah the Prodigy.

6418
03:45:46,300 --> 03:45:47,060
Oh, Noah.

6419
03:45:47,140 --> 03:45:47,320
Yeah.

6420
03:45:47,380 --> 03:45:47,700
And others.

6421
03:45:49,620 --> 03:45:53,320
And then Midwest has like Duel Kevin, Just a Kid.

6422
03:45:53,560 --> 03:45:54,760
And then I'm in Midwest.

6423
03:45:55,300 --> 03:45:55,780
Yeah.

6424
03:45:56,600 --> 03:45:57,860
Oh, you got Jack on yours.

6425
03:45:57,960 --> 03:46:00,060
So you already get your fill of jury.

6426
03:46:00,380 --> 03:46:00,860
Yeah.

6427
03:46:01,300 --> 03:46:01,780
Yeah.

6428
03:46:01,800 --> 03:46:02,920
I got him last time, luckily.

6429
03:46:03,420 --> 03:46:03,900
Wait.

6430
03:46:03,980 --> 03:46:04,220
Look.

6431
03:46:04,280 --> 03:46:04,480
Look.

6432
03:46:04,480 --> 03:46:04,800
Nephew.

6433
03:46:04,800 --> 03:46:06,700
Magic Pixel from Shine.

6434
03:46:06,980 --> 03:46:07,580
Do you know what?

6435
03:46:07,600 --> 03:46:09,480
If there's a character that can do it, it's Kimberly.

6436
03:46:09,820 --> 03:46:10,540
Oh my gosh.

6437
03:46:10,840 --> 03:46:12,300
Oh, I think he's going to do it.

6438
03:46:12,520 --> 03:46:13,040
Oh, okay.

6439
03:46:13,060 --> 03:46:13,360
Yeah.

6440
03:46:13,360 --> 03:46:13,960
String into super.

6441
03:46:14,060 --> 03:46:14,760
It's checkmate.

6442
03:46:14,880 --> 03:46:15,280
Checkmate.

6443
03:46:15,320 --> 03:46:16,800
Oh my God.

6444
03:46:17,140 --> 03:46:18,240
That is insane.

6445
03:46:18,600 --> 03:46:19,440
That's actually insane.

6446
03:46:19,440 --> 03:46:19,580
It's over.

6447
03:46:19,820 --> 03:46:20,760
That's crazy.

6448
03:46:20,880 --> 03:46:22,280
He still needs to win one more.

6449
03:46:22,280 --> 03:46:23,480
I can't shut up when you guys are playing.

6450
03:46:23,700 --> 03:46:25,280
And I need to remember that.

6451
03:46:25,520 --> 03:46:32,900
Like, what he just did right there, the checkmate, you guys, all of you have so many moments where it's a guaranteed win and then you let it slip away.

6452
03:46:33,120 --> 03:46:33,680
And I'm like...

6453
03:46:35,080 --> 03:46:35,760
I get that.

6454
03:46:35,760 --> 03:46:36,560
But I just got to shut up.

6455
03:46:36,560 --> 03:46:36,840
Yeah.

6456
03:46:37,780 --> 03:46:38,580
The checkmate.

6457
03:46:39,220 --> 03:46:39,620
Yeah.

6458
03:46:39,660 --> 03:46:40,780
This game has a lot of checkmates.

6459
03:46:40,980 --> 03:46:41,080
Not me.

6460
03:46:43,320 --> 03:46:43,720
Checkmate.

6461
03:46:43,720 --> 03:46:44,400
Oh, true.

6462
03:46:46,320 --> 03:46:46,720
Okay.

6463
03:46:46,840 --> 03:46:48,840
So now it's going to be...

6464
03:46:48,840 --> 03:46:50,440
He has to play one more, doesn't he?

6465
03:46:51,300 --> 03:46:54,240
Well, it depends on which tournament he holds up.

6466
03:46:55,260 --> 03:46:55,660
Yeah.

6467
03:46:55,660 --> 03:46:56,420
What's going on here?

6468
03:46:56,560 --> 03:46:59,000
Because the other guy won one as well.

6469
03:46:59,080 --> 03:46:59,200
Oh.

6470
03:46:59,700 --> 03:47:02,880
I am not jealous of Shine right now.

6471
03:47:02,960 --> 03:47:05,160
That's crazy what he has to do right now.

6472
03:47:05,660 --> 03:47:06,060
Yeah.

6473
03:47:09,230 --> 03:47:10,270
Shine entered the room.

6474
03:47:11,750 --> 03:47:14,030
Immediately from one crazy match to another.

6475
03:47:14,410 --> 03:47:15,570
Two back-to-back.

6476
03:47:15,630 --> 03:47:16,190
He is going the distance.

6477
03:47:19,760 --> 03:47:20,380
All right.

6478
03:47:20,380 --> 03:47:24,440
I mean, to be honest, this is a high-pressure match, but, like, the CPT tournaments are different.

6479
03:47:24,580 --> 03:47:25,920
I mean, you lose twice, it's over.

6480
03:47:26,360 --> 03:47:26,800
Yeah.

6481
03:47:26,900 --> 03:47:27,220
Damn.

6482
03:47:27,220 --> 03:47:29,980
Like, a double elimination bracket is a whole other beast.

6483
03:47:29,980 --> 03:47:31,380
That's us on Sunday.

6484
03:47:31,820 --> 03:47:32,260
Yeah.

6485
03:47:32,260 --> 03:47:32,680
Yeah.

6486
03:47:32,680 --> 03:47:33,080
Yeah.

6487
03:47:33,080 --> 03:47:33,400
Exactly.

6488
03:47:33,720 --> 03:47:35,200
The nerves are going to hit different.

6489
03:47:36,560 --> 03:47:39,060
Oh, so he's going Ed against Nephew.

6490
03:47:39,220 --> 03:47:39,660
Yeah.

6491
03:47:39,660 --> 03:47:40,620
Let's see what he does.

6492
03:47:40,760 --> 03:47:41,000
Oh, okay.

6493
03:47:41,000 --> 03:47:42,680
I just got fucking shimmied over and over.

6494
03:47:43,400 --> 03:47:44,320
Oh, you're not playing it at all.

6495
03:47:44,320 --> 03:47:44,820
I can't tell you at all.

6496
03:47:45,040 --> 03:47:45,120
Okay, yeah.

6497
03:47:45,420 --> 03:47:49,140
No, we're just watching the Nephew versus...

6498
03:47:49,900 --> 03:47:50,720
I'll pull on...

6499
03:47:50,720 --> 03:47:52,040
I'll do it on Sajam's stream.

6500
03:47:52,400 --> 03:47:53,080
Yeah, I have.

6501
03:47:54,360 --> 03:47:55,040
Same, same.

6502
03:47:55,800 --> 03:47:56,620
I'll do the same.

6503
03:47:56,640 --> 03:47:57,000
Scouting.

6504
03:47:58,600 --> 03:47:59,000
Scouting.

6505
03:47:59,560 --> 03:48:00,960
Oh, Shine's playing Ed?

6506
03:48:01,760 --> 03:48:02,880
Yeah, he plays Ed too.

6507
03:48:02,960 --> 03:48:03,220
Yeah.

6508
03:48:03,220 --> 03:48:06,120
He doesn't do the mirror match with the...

6509
03:48:06,820 --> 03:48:07,220
Yeah.

6510
03:48:07,220 --> 03:48:07,740
He switched Ed.

6511
03:48:07,860 --> 03:48:08,220
...with Bry this season.

6512
03:48:08,340 --> 03:48:09,640
And he just picks Kim for the mirror match.

6513
03:48:09,660 --> 03:48:09,860
Oh, that's interesting.

6514
03:48:09,860 --> 03:48:10,400
For certain matchups.

6515
03:48:11,760 --> 03:48:12,520
Oh, that's interesting.

6516
03:48:12,800 --> 03:48:14,100
Like Aki.

6517
03:48:14,240 --> 03:48:15,280
Against Aki, he was Kim.

6518
03:48:19,070 --> 03:48:20,350
He doesn't like Ed mirror?

6519
03:48:21,590 --> 03:48:22,950
I think he just tries to win with...

6520
03:48:22,950 --> 03:48:23,490
...mirrors in general.

6521
03:48:23,830 --> 03:48:25,270
Yeah, mirrors are kind of cringe.

6522
03:48:25,710 --> 03:48:26,110
Yeah.

6523
03:48:26,490 --> 03:48:27,090
Mirrors are not fun.

6524
03:48:27,090 --> 03:48:27,950
I like beef mirrors.

6525
03:48:28,090 --> 03:48:28,850
They're funny.

6526
03:48:29,130 --> 03:48:29,970
That's like...

6527
03:48:29,970 --> 03:48:30,430
That's...

6528
03:48:30,430 --> 03:48:31,430
That's uncommon.

6529
03:48:32,810 --> 03:48:33,470
It's so funny.

6530
03:48:33,470 --> 03:48:34,430
That is very uncommon, Doki.

6531
03:48:36,370 --> 03:48:37,570
I like random mirrors.

6532
03:48:37,670 --> 03:48:38,230
That's it, though.

6533
03:48:38,250 --> 03:48:38,970
I hate dreamers.

6534
03:48:40,250 --> 03:48:40,850
Oh, wait.

6535
03:48:40,850 --> 03:48:41,030
Dude.

6536
03:48:41,130 --> 03:48:41,490
Dude.

6537
03:48:41,510 --> 03:48:41,910
Do you not...

6538
03:48:41,910 --> 03:48:43,090
Do you like random mirrors?

6539
03:48:43,330 --> 03:48:45,510
I love random mirrors because I win every time.

6540
03:48:47,150 --> 03:48:47,850
I see.

6541
03:48:52,800 --> 03:48:53,980
Oh, this is really close.

6542
03:48:54,000 --> 03:48:54,240
That's...

6543
03:48:54,240 --> 03:48:54,520
Didn't...

6544
03:48:55,400 --> 03:48:57,700
Didn't Shine beat Nephew on Wednesday?

6545
03:48:58,380 --> 03:48:58,800
I don't know.

6546
03:48:58,800 --> 03:48:59,380
He beat JB.

6547
03:48:59,760 --> 03:49:01,400
I don't remember if he beat Nephew.

6548
03:49:01,440 --> 03:49:02,660
No, Nephew was undefeated.

6549
03:49:02,660 --> 03:49:02,740
Oh, yes.

6550
03:49:02,740 --> 03:49:03,460
I think Nephew went undefeated.

6551
03:49:03,500 --> 03:49:03,620
Yeah.

6552
03:49:03,760 --> 03:49:04,000
Yeah.

6553
03:49:04,100 --> 03:49:04,180
Yeah.

6554
03:49:04,260 --> 03:49:06,760
I think Nephew did lose today, too.

6555
03:49:06,940 --> 03:49:07,460
No, he did.

6556
03:49:07,480 --> 03:49:08,100
He lost to two.

6557
03:49:08,780 --> 03:49:09,680
He lost to Diaphone, right?

6558
03:49:09,680 --> 03:49:10,460
Oh, he lost two of them.

6559
03:49:10,560 --> 03:49:10,860
Yeah.

6560
03:49:10,940 --> 03:49:11,560
Lost to Diaphone?

6561
03:49:14,120 --> 03:49:14,480
That's an upset.

6562
03:49:14,620 --> 03:49:15,980
Diaphone is very good.

6563
03:49:16,080 --> 03:49:19,420
Like, a naturally good fighting game player, but he's not, like, a competitive Street Fighter player.

6564
03:49:19,500 --> 03:49:20,400
Like, it's not his main game.

6565
03:49:20,580 --> 03:49:20,940
Oh, wow.

6566
03:49:20,940 --> 03:49:23,320
He plays random selection fighting game.

6567
03:49:24,120 --> 03:49:24,720
There you go.

6568
03:49:24,720 --> 03:49:24,960
I got it.

6569
03:49:24,960 --> 03:49:25,600
That's awesome that he did that.

6570
03:49:25,740 --> 03:49:25,960
Yeah.

6571
03:49:26,280 --> 03:49:26,640
Yeah.

6572
03:49:26,720 --> 03:49:27,440
Oh, that was...

6573
03:49:27,440 --> 03:49:28,480
I love that Superman punch.

6574
03:49:28,520 --> 03:49:30,080
It's better than Keef's knee over that.

6575
03:49:31,280 --> 03:49:32,340
It just can't be plus.

6576
03:49:32,660 --> 03:49:32,780
That Superman punch is sick.

6577
03:49:33,220 --> 03:49:33,580
Yeah.

6578
03:49:33,660 --> 03:49:34,460
It goes over...

6579
03:49:34,460 --> 03:49:36,620
It's good for Juri because it goes over fireballs.

6580
03:49:36,620 --> 03:49:36,760
Yeah.

6581
03:49:36,780 --> 03:49:37,180
I want to play Ed.

6582
03:49:37,280 --> 03:49:37,860
That looks fun.

6583
03:49:38,760 --> 03:49:39,760
The level two.

6584
03:49:39,920 --> 03:49:40,240
Yeah.

6585
03:49:40,580 --> 03:49:41,700
Learn it against Roy.

6586
03:49:41,740 --> 03:49:42,040
Damn, you too, huh?

6587
03:49:42,040 --> 03:49:45,020
It takes a while to get down, I'm telling you.

6588
03:49:45,040 --> 03:49:46,320
That combo is not normal.

6589
03:49:47,300 --> 03:49:47,720
Yeah.

6590
03:49:47,720 --> 03:49:48,860
The desync is kind of hard.

6591
03:49:49,360 --> 03:49:50,820
Do you do it on Mudden?

6592
03:49:52,220 --> 03:49:52,640
No.

6593
03:49:53,120 --> 03:49:53,540
No.

6594
03:49:53,560 --> 03:49:58,960
No matter what you do, it's hard because it's a manual timing to get that specific juggle.

6595
03:49:59,100 --> 03:50:00,740
Like, yeah.

6596
03:50:00,840 --> 03:50:01,740
That's easy to drop.

6597
03:50:01,920 --> 03:50:02,440
Oh, he's dead.

6598
03:50:07,370 --> 03:50:08,210
Oh, unless...

6599
03:50:08,210 --> 03:50:09,110
Oh, that's it.

6600
03:50:09,470 --> 03:50:10,470
Oh, yeah.

6601
03:50:10,590 --> 03:50:11,230
Critical art.

6602
03:50:12,650 --> 03:50:13,070
Yeah.

6603
03:50:13,090 --> 03:50:13,170
Damn.

6604
03:50:13,170 --> 03:50:14,290
When Juri has the...

6605
03:50:14,290 --> 03:50:14,350
Yeah.

6606
03:50:14,350 --> 03:50:17,610
When she has the stores ready, she can burn them in combos and like...

6607
03:50:17,610 --> 03:50:18,030
Oh, he's alive.

6608
03:50:18,250 --> 03:50:18,410
Wait.

6609
03:50:18,450 --> 03:50:18,770
No, he's dead.

6610
03:50:18,810 --> 03:50:19,190
No, he's not.

6611
03:50:19,530 --> 03:50:20,830
He forgot the final hit.

6612
03:50:21,250 --> 03:50:21,690
Yeah.

6613
03:50:22,610 --> 03:50:24,050
If it was regular, maybe.

6614
03:50:24,310 --> 03:50:25,350
But CA, no.

6615
03:50:28,680 --> 03:50:29,320
All right.

6616
03:50:29,960 --> 03:50:30,540
Let's see.

6617
03:50:33,100 --> 03:50:34,740
Nephew knows this matchup well, too.

6618
03:50:34,860 --> 03:50:38,100
There's the other really good NA is Chris ECH.

6619
03:50:38,360 --> 03:50:39,120
He's West Coast.

6620
03:50:39,700 --> 03:50:40,140
Oh.

6621
03:50:40,140 --> 03:50:41,680
So it's like Nephew and Chris ECH fighting.

6622
03:50:41,900 --> 03:50:42,680
So why did...

6623
03:50:42,680 --> 03:50:43,440
Oh, Chris ECH.

6624
03:50:43,440 --> 03:50:44,780
...Try and pick Ed, though, for this matchup?

6625
03:50:45,280 --> 03:50:45,480
Yeah.

6626
03:50:46,400 --> 03:50:48,180
Because he doesn't like him versus that.

6627
03:50:48,240 --> 03:50:49,940
Kim is not a great character overall.

6628
03:50:50,280 --> 03:50:53,320
She's really scrambling fast, but she does low damage.

6629
03:50:53,540 --> 03:50:56,300
And in tournament, most characters are like just shitting out damage.

6630
03:50:56,540 --> 03:50:56,780
Yeah.

6631
03:50:56,900 --> 03:50:58,860
So you have to hit them a bunch.

6632
03:50:59,020 --> 03:50:59,500
I see.

6633
03:50:59,580 --> 03:51:02,200
So she's really scary, but she's not a consistent character.

6634
03:51:02,420 --> 03:51:03,800
So he's trying to move away from Kim.

6635
03:51:04,780 --> 03:51:05,600
I see.

6636
03:51:05,920 --> 03:51:06,320
Woo.

6637
03:51:06,620 --> 03:51:07,380
That overhead.

6638
03:51:07,380 --> 03:51:07,800
Oh.

6639
03:51:07,980 --> 03:51:09,240
Oh, that's nice.

6640
03:51:20,610 --> 03:51:21,470
Clean, clean, clean.

6641
03:51:21,530 --> 03:51:22,470
Really good versus Juri.

6642
03:51:22,570 --> 03:51:22,810
God.

6643
03:51:22,870 --> 03:51:23,130
Yeah.

6644
03:51:23,330 --> 03:51:24,090
Superman punch.

6645
03:51:24,550 --> 03:51:25,270
Nice punish.

6646
03:51:25,390 --> 03:51:25,530
Oh.

6647
03:51:25,530 --> 03:51:25,610
Oh.

6648
03:51:29,860 --> 03:51:32,060
How do I make people want to duck my dry brush?

6649
03:51:33,220 --> 03:51:35,160
You do the low when you do it.

6650
03:51:35,200 --> 03:51:35,500
So they...

6651
03:51:35,500 --> 03:51:36,700
Crouching light kick after.

6652
03:51:36,860 --> 03:51:37,720
Oh, I never do that one.

6653
03:51:37,720 --> 03:51:37,780
Yeah.

6654
03:51:37,780 --> 03:51:39,300
Crouching medium kick or crouching light kick?

6655
03:51:39,360 --> 03:51:39,820
One of those two.

6656
03:51:39,940 --> 03:51:41,420
He dropped the desync there.

6657
03:51:42,780 --> 03:51:43,180
Wow.

6658
03:51:43,240 --> 03:51:43,740
What a noob.

6659
03:51:45,760 --> 03:51:47,160
My coach wouldn't drop that.

6660
03:51:47,160 --> 03:51:47,520
I would never do such a thing.

6661
03:51:47,680 --> 03:51:48,460
No way.

6662
03:51:48,740 --> 03:51:50,520
Speaking of noobs, look at Nephew.

6663
03:51:52,200 --> 03:51:52,600
Oh.

6664
03:51:53,260 --> 03:51:53,660
Oh.

6665
03:51:53,940 --> 03:51:54,980
That was bad.

6666
03:51:55,340 --> 03:51:56,440
That's bad for Nephew.

6667
03:51:56,460 --> 03:51:56,700
Damn, dude.

6668
03:51:56,700 --> 03:51:56,800
Me.

6669
03:51:57,000 --> 03:51:57,840
But wait a minute.

6670
03:51:57,840 --> 03:51:58,640
That's me.

6671
03:51:59,820 --> 03:52:00,920
Oh, he hits those.

6672
03:52:00,920 --> 03:52:02,240
He really called that out?

6673
03:52:02,500 --> 03:52:02,940
What the hell?

6674
03:52:03,340 --> 03:52:03,600
Yeah.

6675
03:52:04,420 --> 03:52:07,920
He would have looked like a scrub if like even that didn't work either, right?

6676
03:52:08,420 --> 03:52:08,820
Because...

6677
03:52:09,340 --> 03:52:11,380
Can you back dash that after the super flash?

6678
03:52:11,420 --> 03:52:13,060
He was too close, I think, to back dash it.

6679
03:52:13,120 --> 03:52:15,880
You can back dash it, but I think Nephew recognized the situation that it was guaranteed.

6680
03:52:17,220 --> 03:52:17,840
That's insane.

6681
03:52:19,440 --> 03:52:19,840
Yeah.

6682
03:52:19,840 --> 03:52:20,380
He's really...

6683
03:52:20,380 --> 03:52:20,520
Oh.

6684
03:52:21,180 --> 03:52:21,900
The counter.

6685
03:52:21,980 --> 03:52:22,260
Oh, nice.

6686
03:52:22,400 --> 03:52:22,640
Oh.

6687
03:52:23,020 --> 03:52:23,560
This is bad.

6688
03:52:23,560 --> 03:52:23,960
This is very close.

6689
03:52:26,580 --> 03:52:26,980
Oh.

6690
03:52:27,280 --> 03:52:27,620
Wait.

6691
03:52:27,720 --> 03:52:27,820
This is bad.

6692
03:52:27,840 --> 03:52:28,080
Does that kill?

6693
03:52:28,180 --> 03:52:28,320
No.

6694
03:52:30,080 --> 03:52:31,280
Oh, but he doesn't...

6695
03:52:31,280 --> 03:52:31,320
Okay.

6696
03:52:31,380 --> 03:52:32,740
This is bad for Shine now.

6697
03:52:32,760 --> 03:52:32,980
Yeah.

6698
03:52:34,420 --> 03:52:35,220
Oh, that's it.

6699
03:52:35,980 --> 03:52:36,340
Oh.

6700
03:52:36,500 --> 03:52:38,720
How does Nephew find these, man?

6701
03:52:39,500 --> 03:52:40,280
Like, what the...

6702
03:52:40,280 --> 03:52:41,840
It's because he quit his job at Google.

6703
03:52:43,360 --> 03:52:44,880
He quit his job at Google.

6704
03:52:45,320 --> 03:52:45,680
Yeah.

6705
03:52:45,720 --> 03:52:45,860
Yeah, dude.

6706
03:52:45,980 --> 03:52:46,740
That's the only reason.

6707
03:52:46,920 --> 03:52:47,880
He better be finding these.

6708
03:52:48,280 --> 03:52:48,640
Yeah.

6709
03:52:48,660 --> 03:52:50,680
He left his job at Google.

6710
03:52:50,720 --> 03:52:51,520
Come on, guys.

6711
03:52:51,600 --> 03:52:52,580
He don't got a nine to five no more.

6712
03:52:52,580 --> 03:52:53,080
I'm finding these a lot.

6713
03:52:53,160 --> 03:52:56,600
Maybe it's time to quit my high paying...

6714
03:52:56,600 --> 03:52:57,820
That's the next level.

6715
03:52:57,820 --> 03:52:58,120
That's the next level, coach.

6716
03:52:58,280 --> 03:52:58,740
I'm telling you.

6717
03:52:58,800 --> 03:52:59,120
Career.

6718
03:52:59,420 --> 03:53:00,700
Right next to the piss buff.

6719
03:53:00,840 --> 03:53:02,540
It's the quitting your job and the piss buff.

6720
03:53:02,940 --> 03:53:03,680
That's how it is.

6721
03:53:03,800 --> 03:53:07,080
Well, the thing is Nephew started winning before he quit, so...

6722
03:53:07,080 --> 03:53:07,960
No, Nephew was...

6723
03:53:07,960 --> 03:53:10,540
I like watching his Colleen in five.

6724
03:53:10,820 --> 03:53:11,100
Yeah.

6725
03:53:11,160 --> 03:53:12,100
He's always been Godlike.

6726
03:53:14,440 --> 03:53:15,680
All these guys have, right?

6727
03:53:15,720 --> 03:53:17,100
Like Shine, Nephew...

6728
03:53:17,100 --> 03:53:17,440
Oh, yeah.

6729
03:53:17,740 --> 03:53:18,180
...JB.

6730
03:53:19,420 --> 03:53:22,040
We've been playing Street Butterfly tournaments for so long.

6731
03:53:23,800 --> 03:53:24,240
Ooh.

6732
03:53:24,800 --> 03:53:26,560
Oh, he could have converted that.

6733
03:53:26,760 --> 03:53:27,200
Oh.

6734
03:53:27,940 --> 03:53:28,380
Jumping medium.

6735
03:53:28,600 --> 03:53:29,040
Oh.

6736
03:53:29,520 --> 03:53:30,140
Jumping medium.

6737
03:53:30,560 --> 03:53:31,360
Nephew's about the style.

6738
03:53:31,600 --> 03:53:32,920
I think Nephew is gonna...

6739
03:53:32,920 --> 03:53:33,120
Yeah.

6740
03:53:34,080 --> 03:53:34,520
Oh.

6741
03:53:35,160 --> 03:53:35,600
Okay.

6742
03:53:35,640 --> 03:53:35,820
Yeah.

6743
03:53:35,860 --> 03:53:36,160
It's over.

6744
03:53:36,340 --> 03:53:36,800
It's over.

6745
03:53:37,060 --> 03:53:37,320
Okay.

6746
03:53:37,320 --> 03:53:39,960
Well, Nephew maybe demoralized him and then I got to play...

6747
03:53:39,960 --> 03:53:40,940
You got to play Shine.

6748
03:53:41,220 --> 03:53:42,360
I got to play Shine.

6749
03:53:42,420 --> 03:53:42,700
Yeah.

6750
03:53:42,720 --> 03:53:43,260
We'll see what he does.

6751
03:53:43,420 --> 03:53:45,460
God, Shine is going through the ringer right now.

6752
03:53:47,120 --> 03:53:50,080
Maybe he'll like mentally break after that, you know?

6753
03:53:50,960 --> 03:53:51,520
We'll see.

6754
03:53:51,740 --> 03:53:52,420
We'll see.

6755
03:53:52,420 --> 03:53:52,500
We'll see.

6756
03:53:52,660 --> 03:53:53,000
Okay.

6757
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:54,100
Time to lock in.

6758
03:53:54,100 --> 03:53:54,460
All right, amigo.

6759
03:53:54,460 --> 03:53:55,420
Get in there.

6760
03:53:55,740 --> 03:53:56,240
All right.

6761
03:53:56,240 --> 03:53:57,420
Whatever happens, GG's.

6762
03:54:01,770 --> 03:54:02,170
Okay.

6763
03:54:02,270 --> 03:54:03,470
I should knock Brian's stream.

6764
03:54:03,470 --> 03:54:04,030
Absolutely zero pressure.

6765
03:54:04,490 --> 03:54:04,890
Yeah.

6766
03:54:04,930 --> 03:54:05,630
Zero pressure.

6767
03:54:05,650 --> 03:54:07,730
Even if you lose, we will clutch out tomorrow.

6768
03:54:08,090 --> 03:54:08,330
Yeah.

6769
03:54:08,570 --> 03:54:08,970
No.

6770
03:54:08,970 --> 03:54:09,610
Just Saturday.

6771
03:54:10,090 --> 03:54:10,490
Sunday.

6772
03:54:10,590 --> 03:54:10,790
Sorry.

6773
03:54:10,870 --> 03:54:11,250
Sunday.

6774
03:54:11,970 --> 03:54:12,490
Fear not.

6775
03:54:12,490 --> 03:54:12,510
No fear.

6776
03:54:12,510 --> 03:54:15,450
If you lose, we do have to fight the team that killed us, but that's fine.

6777
03:54:15,450 --> 03:54:18,810
Guys, I need you guys to lab them because I know they're gonna lab me, please.

6778
03:54:19,630 --> 03:54:21,350
I don't know if I can clutch it.

6779
03:54:21,630 --> 03:54:22,790
I don't know if I can clutch.

6780
03:54:22,790 --> 03:54:22,810
Come on, coach.

6781
03:54:23,090 --> 03:54:23,670
Let's go.

6782
03:54:23,830 --> 03:54:24,250
All right.

6783
03:54:24,250 --> 03:54:24,930
Let's do this, brother.

6784
03:54:25,290 --> 03:54:26,290
Team Brian Fury.

6785
03:54:26,850 --> 03:54:27,250
Get in there.

6786
03:54:29,900 --> 03:54:30,580
Let's go.

6787
03:54:30,880 --> 03:54:31,180
Let's go.

6788
03:54:31,920 --> 03:54:33,040
Let me use the bathroom.

6789
03:54:33,100 --> 03:54:33,500
Too much pressure.

6790
03:54:57,100 --> 03:54:57,580
Nice.

6791
03:54:57,700 --> 03:54:58,380
I got that jump back.

6792
03:54:58,660 --> 03:54:59,820
That was so clean.

6793
03:55:06,100 --> 03:55:06,800
There you go.

6794
03:55:06,920 --> 03:55:07,300
Okay.

6795
03:55:07,400 --> 03:55:07,600
Keep it.

6796
03:55:07,720 --> 03:55:08,800
Oh, the jump out.

6797
03:55:08,920 --> 03:55:09,600
The flip out.

6798
03:55:09,800 --> 03:55:10,280
Spaghetti.

6799
03:55:15,330 --> 03:55:16,290
The trades.

6800
03:55:16,730 --> 03:55:17,210
Okay.

6801
03:55:20,690 --> 03:55:21,170
Ooh.

6802
03:55:21,410 --> 03:55:22,510
Got the classic.

6803
03:55:26,740 --> 03:55:27,220
Nice.

6804
03:55:34,740 --> 03:55:35,220
Ooh.

6805
03:55:35,340 --> 03:55:35,580
Good play.

6806
03:55:35,600 --> 03:55:35,760
Good block.

6807
03:55:35,880 --> 03:55:36,180
Nice.

6808
03:55:38,140 --> 03:55:38,720
Ah, yeah.

6809
03:55:38,740 --> 03:55:38,900
Okay.

6810
03:55:39,020 --> 03:55:39,520
That's fine.

6811
03:55:39,860 --> 03:55:40,320
That's it.

6812
03:55:40,560 --> 03:55:41,880
No meter for next round.

6813
03:55:41,960 --> 03:55:42,200
Let's go.

6814
03:55:45,320 --> 03:55:48,060
Those are really good blocks, but yeah, can't block everything.

6815
03:55:48,520 --> 03:55:49,300
Yeah, dude.

6816
03:55:49,620 --> 03:55:52,620
She's so obnoxious, too, sometimes with her corner pressure.

6817
03:56:10,420 --> 03:56:10,860
Ooh.

6818
03:56:11,020 --> 03:56:11,460
Good.

6819
03:56:11,820 --> 03:56:12,260
Nice.

6820
03:56:13,040 --> 03:56:13,700
Good hit.

6821
03:56:14,720 --> 03:56:15,360
Let's go.

6822
03:56:19,140 --> 03:56:20,060
Let's go, coach.

6823
03:56:20,220 --> 03:56:20,460
Let's go, coach.

6824
03:56:20,460 --> 03:56:20,840
Let's go, coach.

6825
03:56:20,840 --> 03:56:21,060
Let's go, coach.

6826
03:56:23,590 --> 03:56:23,990
Let's go.

6827
03:56:23,990 --> 03:56:24,370
Get over here.

6828
03:56:29,380 --> 03:56:29,780
Nice.

6829
03:56:29,820 --> 03:56:30,200
Oh, yeah.

6830
03:56:30,200 --> 03:56:30,420
Oh, nice.

6831
03:56:36,320 --> 03:56:36,720
Okay.

6832
03:56:39,060 --> 03:56:39,900
Oh, good entire.

6833
03:56:40,540 --> 03:56:40,940
Yes.

6834
03:56:40,940 --> 03:56:41,200
Yes.

6835
03:56:41,660 --> 03:56:43,020
I love the jump low.

6836
03:56:43,120 --> 03:56:43,200
Oh, my God.

6837
03:56:43,320 --> 03:56:44,040
I love that.

6838
03:56:44,220 --> 03:56:45,980
That is trademark Brian Fury.

6839
03:56:46,380 --> 03:56:46,920
Let's go.

6840
03:56:48,300 --> 03:56:48,700
Oh.

6841
03:57:03,080 --> 03:57:03,860
Oh, thank God.

6842
03:57:03,920 --> 03:57:04,500
That didn't go through.

6843
03:57:04,640 --> 03:57:05,000
I know.

6844
03:57:05,040 --> 03:57:05,300
Right?

6845
03:57:09,530 --> 03:57:09,930
Okay.

6846
03:57:10,070 --> 03:57:10,370
Yes.

6847
03:57:10,470 --> 03:57:10,630
Yes.

6848
03:57:10,670 --> 03:57:11,030
Big grab.

6849
03:57:34,990 --> 03:57:35,710
Oh, yes.

6850
03:57:35,850 --> 03:57:36,130
Wow.

6851
03:57:36,130 --> 03:57:36,970
Get the drive rush.

6852
03:57:37,010 --> 03:57:37,170
Get the drive rush.

6853
03:57:37,190 --> 03:57:37,370
Cancel.

6854
03:57:37,390 --> 03:57:37,690
Let's go.

6855
03:57:42,780 --> 03:57:44,120
Oh, good anti-air.

6856
03:57:44,900 --> 03:57:45,840
Oh, my God.

6857
03:57:46,660 --> 03:57:47,200
Oh, my God.

6858
03:57:47,200 --> 03:57:47,420
Oh, yes.

6859
03:57:47,660 --> 03:57:48,540
Keep him in the corner.

6860
03:57:48,660 --> 03:57:48,920
Nice.

6861
03:57:50,660 --> 03:57:51,460
Oh, yeah.

6862
03:57:51,620 --> 03:57:52,840
That trade was not in his favor.

6863
03:57:55,060 --> 03:57:55,660
All right.

6864
03:57:55,740 --> 03:57:56,080
That's all right.

6865
03:57:56,240 --> 03:57:59,400
You're playing neutral like very solid, dude.

6866
03:58:00,000 --> 03:58:00,400
Super.

6867
03:58:06,470 --> 03:58:07,330
Ah, okay.

6868
03:58:07,570 --> 03:58:07,970
Okay.

6869
03:58:10,550 --> 03:58:11,630
Oh, that's close.

6870
03:58:12,250 --> 03:58:12,870
Very close.

6871
03:58:12,950 --> 03:58:13,490
So close.

6872
03:58:13,830 --> 03:58:14,230
That's close.

6873
03:58:14,250 --> 03:58:14,730
Very close.

6874
03:58:14,830 --> 03:58:15,630
Still in there.

6875
03:58:17,430 --> 03:58:18,630
Still in there.

6876
03:58:36,400 --> 03:58:37,080
Oh, good.

6877
03:58:37,280 --> 03:58:37,760
Interrupt.

6878
03:58:43,900 --> 03:58:44,380
Oh.

6879
03:58:44,400 --> 03:58:44,840
Nice.

6880
03:58:45,060 --> 03:58:45,640
That's insane.

6881
03:58:46,060 --> 03:58:46,580
Uh-huh.

6882
03:58:54,890 --> 03:58:55,850
Good blocks.

6883
03:59:01,900 --> 03:59:02,380
Hmm.

6884
03:59:10,620 --> 03:59:11,100
Okay.

6885
03:59:11,120 --> 03:59:11,300
Okay.

6886
03:59:11,340 --> 03:59:11,720
No worries.

6887
03:59:12,220 --> 03:59:12,920
Win a bolt.

6888
03:59:13,460 --> 03:59:14,140
Win a bolt.

6889
03:59:14,200 --> 03:59:14,420
Win a bolt.

6890
03:59:54,290 --> 03:59:54,770
Ah.

6891
03:59:56,450 --> 03:59:56,930
No.

6892
03:59:57,090 --> 03:59:58,170
Oh, it's all right.

6893
03:59:58,250 --> 03:59:58,390
Good game.

6894
03:59:58,410 --> 03:59:58,870
All right.

6895
03:59:58,870 --> 04:00:00,210
We'll rap against Otto.

6896
04:00:00,650 --> 04:00:01,050
No.

6897
04:00:01,050 --> 04:00:01,450
Don't worry.

6898
04:00:01,910 --> 04:00:03,850
We're going to learn all tomorrow.

6899
04:00:04,290 --> 04:00:04,810
We're going to...

6900
04:00:04,810 --> 04:00:05,010
Yeah.

6901
04:00:05,050 --> 04:00:05,310
Got it.

6902
04:00:05,350 --> 04:00:05,750
Yeah.

6903
04:00:05,750 --> 04:00:06,530
They got me this time.

6904
04:00:06,530 --> 04:00:08,010
They just jumped at me so much.

6905
04:00:08,010 --> 04:00:09,670
I was scared of the elbow drop the whole time.

6906
04:00:10,730 --> 04:00:11,130
Yeah.

6907
04:00:11,150 --> 04:00:12,950
I didn't see an elbow drop like at all.

6908
04:00:13,310 --> 04:00:13,710
No.

6909
04:00:14,210 --> 04:00:14,850
All right.

6910
04:00:14,890 --> 04:00:15,470
All right.

6911
04:00:15,470 --> 04:00:15,870
Well, GG.

6912
04:00:16,090 --> 04:00:17,310
Well, overall, we played really good, though.

6913
04:00:17,430 --> 04:00:18,490
Sorry I didn't clutch it up.

6914
04:00:18,750 --> 04:00:18,910
Yeah.

6915
04:00:18,990 --> 04:00:19,510
It's all right.

6916
04:00:19,510 --> 04:00:19,970
It's all right.

6917
04:00:19,970 --> 04:00:20,770
No, we were good, dude.

6918
04:00:20,950 --> 04:00:22,050
We got this.

6919
04:00:22,090 --> 04:00:23,470
I'm sorry I didn't win more than one match.

6920
04:00:25,330 --> 04:00:26,030
It's all good.

6921
04:00:28,410 --> 04:00:30,830
I think all of us played so much better today.

6922
04:00:30,950 --> 04:00:30,990
I'm sorry I won all five.

6923
04:00:33,190 --> 04:00:36,310
We all played so much better today, so I think we should have improved.

6924
04:00:36,490 --> 04:00:36,630
Yeah.

6925
04:00:36,630 --> 04:00:41,150
Even if we didn't win the same stats or whatever, the game plans are much more consistent.

6926
04:00:41,790 --> 04:00:42,190
Yeah.

6927
04:00:42,470 --> 04:00:42,670
Yeah.

6928
04:00:42,890 --> 04:00:43,210
Yeah.

6929
04:00:43,710 --> 04:00:44,530
We're in a good spot.

6930
04:00:44,590 --> 04:00:47,930
I'm worried because I feel like a lot of people are going to lab me now because of that.

6931
04:00:47,930 --> 04:00:50,090
They will, but just run your game.

6932
04:00:50,170 --> 04:00:50,930
Should be okay.

6933
04:00:51,990 --> 04:00:54,650
And you don't have to fight everyone against Sunday, right?

6934
04:00:54,710 --> 04:00:55,610
You'll have to fight the models.

6935
04:00:55,610 --> 04:00:56,570
We have to fight Otto.

6936
04:00:56,890 --> 04:00:57,290
Yeah.

6937
04:00:57,910 --> 04:01:02,410
And then after Otto, we have to fight either JB or Phon.

6938
04:01:04,730 --> 04:01:06,550
We can just fight for those teams then.

6939
04:01:06,610 --> 04:01:07,110
We're chilling.

6940
04:01:07,950 --> 04:01:09,890
Like, we're for sure fighting Otto?

6941
04:01:10,130 --> 04:01:11,310
I don't know if we're fighting.

6942
04:01:11,390 --> 04:01:11,870
I don't know.

6943
04:01:11,890 --> 04:01:14,810
Yeah, because if they're fourth place, then we fight them.

6944
04:01:14,810 --> 04:01:17,990
I don't know if it's like third and fourth play and then fifth and sixth play.

6945
04:01:18,050 --> 04:01:21,290
No, usually first fights fourth and then third fights second.

6946
04:01:21,690 --> 04:01:22,150
Oh.

6947
04:01:22,810 --> 04:01:23,270
Yeah.

6948
04:01:23,290 --> 04:01:24,210
It's kind of the same thing.

6949
04:01:24,370 --> 04:01:24,430
Yeah.

6950
04:01:24,430 --> 04:01:25,570
I don't know.

6951
04:01:25,590 --> 04:01:26,910
The higher seed will fight the lower seed.

6952
04:01:27,090 --> 04:01:28,290
That's the point.

6953
04:01:28,410 --> 04:01:30,870
You should get an advantage for being the best.

6954
04:01:31,210 --> 04:01:32,650
Second, we'll fight fifth then.

6955
04:01:32,790 --> 04:01:34,110
So who will we fight then?

6956
04:01:34,150 --> 04:01:35,190
We'll fight Phon then.

6957
04:01:35,210 --> 04:01:35,750
So then we'll fight Dia third.

6958
04:01:36,030 --> 04:01:37,450
So we'll fight team Shine.

6959
04:01:37,450 --> 04:01:40,030
Sykuna, Morphe, Box, and Dia.

6960
04:01:40,190 --> 04:01:40,730
Team Shine then.

6961
04:01:40,810 --> 04:01:41,290
Okay, cool.

6962
04:01:41,370 --> 04:01:41,610
Oh, Shine.

6963
04:01:41,810 --> 04:01:42,870
Oh, we're fighting Shine's team?

6964
04:01:43,110 --> 04:01:43,790
Okay, okay, okay.

6965
04:01:44,150 --> 04:01:44,930
Are you sure?

6966
04:01:45,450 --> 04:01:48,290
Wait, is everybody in winners or do the other teams start in losers?

6967
04:01:48,970 --> 04:01:49,750
No, no, no.

6968
04:01:49,890 --> 04:01:50,570
Everyone's in winners.

6969
04:01:50,930 --> 04:01:51,630
Oh, never mind.

6970
04:01:51,770 --> 04:01:53,490
Yeah, but the winner teams get a buy.

6971
04:01:53,510 --> 04:01:54,410
Yeah, the winner teams get a buy.

6972
04:01:54,410 --> 04:02:01,510
We'll play the fourth seed, we're seed three, and then we'll play the winner of...

6973
04:02:01,990 --> 04:02:02,570
I guess...

6974
04:02:02,570 --> 04:02:03,250
Well, it depends on...

6975
04:02:03,250 --> 04:02:06,290
Normally we'd play seed fourth or if we didn't have a buy, but we have a buy.

6976
04:02:06,410 --> 04:02:06,950
So that means...

6977
04:02:06,950 --> 04:02:07,530
No, we don't.

6978
04:02:07,530 --> 04:02:08,290
We don't have a buy.

6979
04:02:08,330 --> 04:02:08,830
I thought only...

6980
04:02:08,830 --> 04:02:09,250
No, we don't.

6981
04:02:09,490 --> 04:02:10,810
One and two have a buy.

6982
04:02:11,030 --> 04:02:13,810
Nephew and Shine have a buy, because that's what happened in Tekken.

6983
04:02:14,090 --> 04:02:14,130
Oh.

6984
04:02:14,130 --> 04:02:15,850
So then wasn't it third versus fourth?

6985
04:02:16,050 --> 04:02:16,810
I thought...

6986
04:02:16,810 --> 04:02:17,590
Yeah, this is crazy.

6987
04:02:17,790 --> 04:02:18,050
Yeah.

6988
04:02:19,350 --> 04:02:20,870
I think we're going to play sixth place.

6989
04:02:21,150 --> 04:02:22,070
Oh, we're playing sixth place?

6990
04:02:22,070 --> 04:02:23,050
It's third versus sixth.

6991
04:02:23,190 --> 04:02:23,350
I think.

6992
04:02:23,350 --> 04:02:24,230
It's third versus sixth.

6993
04:02:24,230 --> 04:02:24,390
I think.

6994
04:02:24,390 --> 04:02:24,510
It's third versus sixth.

6995
04:02:24,510 --> 04:02:24,850
Yeah.

6996
04:02:24,930 --> 04:02:27,510
We become the seed of the remaining team.

6997
04:02:27,970 --> 04:02:28,410
Oh.

6998
04:02:28,590 --> 04:02:30,330
So we're just going to be fighting...

6999
04:02:30,330 --> 04:02:32,010
We're fighting JB's team.

7000
04:02:32,050 --> 04:02:32,410
JB's team.

7001
04:02:32,470 --> 04:02:32,630
JB.

7002
04:02:32,750 --> 04:02:33,190
Okay.

7003
04:02:33,550 --> 04:02:36,630
So Gumi, Ultima, S-Fan, and Cosmonaut.

7004
04:02:37,490 --> 04:02:37,930
Okay.

7005
04:02:37,990 --> 04:02:38,310
Gotcha.

7006
04:02:38,570 --> 04:02:38,810
Yeah.

7007
04:02:38,810 --> 04:02:40,570
God, that's so confusing, man.

7008
04:02:40,730 --> 04:02:41,030
Yeah.

7009
04:02:41,130 --> 04:02:41,530
Yeah.

7010
04:02:41,530 --> 04:02:42,190
It's a little weird.

7011
04:02:42,370 --> 04:02:43,990
They'll tell us the final thing.

7012
04:02:44,910 --> 04:02:47,430
I guess if we beat JB...

7013
04:02:48,170 --> 04:02:49,930
Then we have to win one more.

7014
04:02:50,190 --> 04:02:50,870
One more.

7015
04:02:50,950 --> 04:02:51,150
Yeah.

7016
04:02:51,550 --> 04:02:53,590
So we have to win two to get top four.

7017
04:02:53,870 --> 04:02:54,310
Guaranteed.

7018
04:02:55,170 --> 04:02:55,530
Guaranteed.

7019
04:02:55,530 --> 04:02:55,630
Guaranteed.

7020
04:02:55,630 --> 04:02:55,870
Okay.

7021
04:02:56,710 --> 04:02:57,810
And that buy would have been nice.

7022
04:02:58,050 --> 04:02:58,290
Ugh.

7023
04:02:59,330 --> 04:02:59,810
It's okay.

7024
04:02:59,950 --> 04:03:00,090
Couldn't lock in.

7025
04:03:00,710 --> 04:03:01,070
No.

7026
04:03:01,190 --> 04:03:01,470
You...

7027
04:03:01,470 --> 04:03:03,270
You have some hard-ass...

7028
04:03:03,270 --> 04:03:04,070
I mean...

7029
04:03:04,630 --> 04:03:06,630
They're jumping so much at me too.

7030
04:03:06,710 --> 04:03:06,870
Yeah.

7031
04:03:06,870 --> 04:03:07,050
With Shine.

7032
04:03:07,170 --> 04:03:07,830
That's so smart.

7033
04:03:07,950 --> 04:03:08,550
Because the elbow drop.

7034
04:03:08,610 --> 04:03:11,290
He did elbow drop with me so many times in the first match.

7035
04:03:11,290 --> 04:03:12,610
He did it more in the first set.

7036
04:03:12,690 --> 04:03:13,010
Yes.

7037
04:03:13,130 --> 04:03:13,790
And then he switched it up here.

7038
04:03:13,790 --> 04:03:13,810
Yeah.

7039
04:03:13,810 --> 04:03:14,990
And my DP got baited.

7040
04:03:15,010 --> 04:03:15,910
And I was like, okay, don't DP.

7041
04:03:16,130 --> 04:03:17,090
Because he's going to elbow drop.

7042
04:03:17,330 --> 04:03:19,470
But that's why Kim is annoying to fight as Ed.

7043
04:03:19,590 --> 04:03:23,990
It's hard to stop or jump sometimes if you're not super locked in.

7044
04:03:24,090 --> 04:03:24,370
Yeah.

7045
04:03:24,390 --> 04:03:24,470
Yeah.

7046
04:03:24,470 --> 04:03:26,330
That's why I like when you did like the jump back stuff.

7047
04:03:26,430 --> 04:03:26,890
It's so...

7048
04:03:26,890 --> 04:03:27,390
I'm like, yeah.

7049
04:03:27,590 --> 04:03:27,790
Wait.

7050
04:03:27,810 --> 04:03:28,090
Yeah.

7051
04:03:28,170 --> 04:03:28,530
Yeah.

7052
04:03:28,550 --> 04:03:29,730
Jumping back mid-screen is good.

7053
04:03:29,790 --> 04:03:30,550
Just avoid the throws.

7054
04:03:30,850 --> 04:03:39,050
Guys, all I'm saying is that if we do get to TwitchCon, Shine's team is hella nerfed because they have two VTubers that can't make it to TwitchCon.

7055
04:03:40,790 --> 04:03:41,670
I mean, we got...

7056
04:03:41,670 --> 04:03:42,630
Who was replacing them?

7057
04:03:42,630 --> 04:03:43,010
We don't know.

7058
04:03:43,350 --> 04:03:43,790
The two team...

7059
04:03:43,790 --> 04:03:44,030
Yeah.

7060
04:03:44,030 --> 04:03:44,510
We don't...

7061
04:03:44,510 --> 04:03:45,170
The two...

7062
04:03:45,170 --> 04:03:49,350
Well, it's replacing them as like two players from the teams that get eliminated.

7063
04:03:50,970 --> 04:03:51,770
Oh, true.

7064
04:03:51,970 --> 04:03:52,330
Yeah.

7065
04:03:52,350 --> 04:03:52,930
I don't know.

7066
04:03:53,030 --> 04:03:53,830
Oh, is that how it is?

7067
04:03:53,830 --> 04:03:53,990
Yeah.

7068
04:03:54,010 --> 04:03:54,610
That's how it is.

7069
04:03:54,790 --> 04:03:55,090
Yeah.

7070
04:03:55,150 --> 04:03:55,550
That doesn't mean anything.

7071
04:03:55,650 --> 04:03:57,670
There could be godlike players in any...

7072
04:03:58,110 --> 04:03:59,530
You know, you can't call it.

7073
04:03:59,950 --> 04:04:00,350
Yeah.

7074
04:04:00,390 --> 04:04:00,710
True.

7075
04:04:00,870 --> 04:04:01,270
That's all I'm saying.

7076
04:04:02,490 --> 04:04:03,750
That's all I'm saying.

7077
04:04:04,950 --> 04:04:05,690
I'm just saying.

7078
04:04:05,690 --> 04:04:07,130
They're losing two of their players.

7079
04:04:07,370 --> 04:04:08,070
Madoki, you'll go, right?

7080
04:04:08,070 --> 04:04:08,530
That's all I'm saying.

7081
04:04:08,970 --> 04:04:10,950
Because I know we'll be nerfed if you don't go.

7082
04:04:10,950 --> 04:04:11,990
I'll never tell.

7083
04:04:13,790 --> 04:04:15,410
Oh, we're going to be so nerfed.

7084
04:04:16,250 --> 04:04:17,890
We might get buffed, actually.

7085
04:04:18,110 --> 04:04:18,470
Yeah, we might.

7086
04:04:18,470 --> 04:04:18,910
We don't know yet.

7087
04:04:20,350 --> 04:04:23,770
If we can negotiate with Sejam, we might get buffed.

7088
04:04:23,770 --> 04:04:23,810
Yeah.

7089
04:04:25,050 --> 04:04:26,390
We know a guy.

7090
04:04:26,590 --> 04:04:27,130
We just gotta put a wig on him.

7091
04:04:27,130 --> 04:04:28,150
He's not going to allow it.

7092
04:04:28,410 --> 04:04:29,050
No, he will.

7093
04:04:29,430 --> 04:04:30,770
He owes me one.

7094
04:04:31,650 --> 04:04:33,190
He owes me one.

7095
04:04:33,550 --> 04:04:35,150
That's like literally free.

7096
04:04:35,150 --> 04:04:35,330
Damn.

7097
04:04:36,970 --> 04:04:38,450
He owes me one.

7098
04:04:38,710 --> 04:04:40,190
And he knows I'll make content.

7099
04:04:40,310 --> 04:04:42,090
He knows I'll give us content.

7100
04:04:43,030 --> 04:04:43,530
Yeah.

7101
04:04:43,530 --> 04:04:45,650
But with money for other people on the line.

7102
04:04:47,190 --> 04:04:49,130
Suddenly you're messing with other people's money.

7103
04:04:49,790 --> 04:04:52,810
Sejam might not approve, but we'll see.

7104
04:04:52,870 --> 04:04:53,190
We'll see.

7105
04:04:53,830 --> 04:04:54,350
It's okay.

7106
04:04:54,590 --> 04:04:58,230
I will negotiate if we get into TwitchCon.

7107
04:05:01,750 --> 04:05:03,550
Man, I should have won against Sejam.

7108
04:05:03,650 --> 04:05:04,130
Wow, dude.

7109
04:05:04,270 --> 04:05:04,590
Damn.

7110
04:05:04,910 --> 04:05:06,470
What threw you off against him?

7111
04:05:06,650 --> 04:05:07,530
I couldn't tell.

7112
04:05:07,910 --> 04:05:11,650
I think it's when I was starting to play neutral.

7113
04:05:12,670 --> 04:05:13,730
Like, unironically, Doki.

7114
04:05:13,830 --> 04:05:14,250
Like, real talk.

7115
04:05:14,510 --> 04:05:18,850
Like, when I started to kind of like, feel him out from full screen, that's when I stopped.

7116
04:05:19,330 --> 04:05:21,270
Stopped kind of like, I don't know.

7117
04:05:21,410 --> 04:05:23,110
I get like very, very...

7118
04:05:23,110 --> 04:05:23,790
I don't know.

7119
04:05:23,790 --> 04:05:23,970
I don't know.

7120
04:05:23,970 --> 04:05:24,650
What's the word for it?

7121
04:05:25,130 --> 04:05:25,530
Like...

7122
04:05:26,030 --> 04:05:26,430
Apprehensive?

7123
04:05:27,310 --> 04:05:27,710
No.

7124
04:05:27,850 --> 04:05:28,710
It's like one...

7125
04:05:28,710 --> 04:05:29,670
One dimensional.

7126
04:05:29,750 --> 04:05:31,210
What the world am I talking about?

7127
04:05:31,310 --> 04:05:33,830
I basically stick to one strat and one strat only.

7128
04:05:35,690 --> 04:05:36,770
It's like tunnel vision.

7129
04:05:36,890 --> 04:05:37,290
That's what it is.

7130
04:05:37,290 --> 04:05:37,570
Tunnel vision.

7131
04:05:37,690 --> 04:05:41,890
I get tunnel vision on like one strat instead of like trying to go for like other things.

7132
04:05:42,090 --> 04:05:42,830
But once my...

7133
04:05:42,830 --> 04:05:44,270
I think my offense is really good.

7134
04:05:44,410 --> 04:05:48,510
It's just like feeling out the neutral and getting to that offense is what's throwing me off right...

7135
04:05:48,510 --> 04:05:49,610
What threw me off in that match.

7136
04:05:49,970 --> 04:05:50,370
Yeah.

7137
04:05:50,530 --> 04:05:53,770
I mean, you gave him more time to breathe in neutral and then DJ can zone from it.

7138
04:05:53,770 --> 04:05:54,110
From a distance.

7139
04:05:54,470 --> 04:05:54,790
Yep.

7140
04:05:54,790 --> 04:05:55,810
We already came up with the DJ set, right?

7141
04:05:56,330 --> 04:05:56,650
Yeah.

7142
04:05:56,690 --> 04:05:56,850
Yeah.

7143
04:05:56,850 --> 04:05:57,890
No, this is the DJ set in particular.

7144
04:05:57,890 --> 04:05:58,170
Yeah.

7145
04:05:58,170 --> 04:05:58,330
Yeah.

7146
04:05:58,450 --> 04:06:01,990
You give him a chance to zone from a distance and that can be tough for Aki.

7147
04:06:02,290 --> 04:06:04,490
Like if she steamrolls DJ, then it's all good.

7148
04:06:04,630 --> 04:06:08,190
But if he zones you and then rushes you down, that's like playing into his best game plan.

7149
04:06:08,350 --> 04:06:08,670
Yeah.

7150
04:06:08,670 --> 04:06:15,590
That's why like you have to just figure out better times to fireball and coward crouch to get the lunging punch or like driver stand medium.

7151
04:06:15,730 --> 04:06:16,210
That's the thing.

7152
04:06:16,270 --> 04:06:17,930
You still weren't using that much driver stand medium.

7153
04:06:18,170 --> 04:06:26,370
And I think that would have been like a godlike burst option to just get in and then driver stand medium into coward crouch, immediate command grab or kicks.

7154
04:06:26,630 --> 04:06:27,090
You know what I mean?

7155
04:06:27,330 --> 04:06:27,730
Yeah.

7156
04:06:27,790 --> 04:06:31,070
Like the burst options had to be a little bit more ready.

7157
04:06:31,470 --> 04:06:34,410
But once you slow down, it actually helped him out so much.

7158
04:06:34,650 --> 04:06:35,050
Yeah.

7159
04:06:35,050 --> 04:06:38,850
So I think that's definitely something I have to work on with him in particular.

7160
04:06:39,450 --> 04:06:42,330
I know that he parries a lot, so I'm like, oh, I can...

7161
04:06:42,990 --> 04:06:50,070
I think the flow chart that I got works a lot on him, but it's all about like keeping the pressure on.

7162
04:06:50,630 --> 04:06:51,030
Right.

7163
04:06:52,110 --> 04:06:52,510
Yeah.

7164
04:06:52,530 --> 04:06:53,050
Your offense is...

7165
04:06:53,390 --> 04:06:53,890
It's crazy good.

7166
04:06:54,010 --> 04:06:57,570
If we win our first match, who would we play against?

7167
04:06:57,830 --> 04:06:58,450
So we could...

7168
04:06:58,450 --> 04:06:59,630
We might be able to calculate.

7169
04:06:59,710 --> 04:07:02,350
I'm waiting for the Jam Man to send out the bracket, dude.

7170
04:07:02,370 --> 04:07:03,050
Let's see the bracket.

7171
04:07:03,190 --> 04:07:03,510
Yeah.

7172
04:07:03,510 --> 04:07:04,150
It's getting too complex.

7173
04:07:04,150 --> 04:07:05,310
Is he going to send it today or...

7174
04:07:05,310 --> 04:07:05,910
Or yeah.

7175
04:07:05,910 --> 04:07:06,530
Right now or...

7176
04:07:06,530 --> 04:07:06,730
I see.

7177
04:07:07,970 --> 04:07:08,550
We'll see.

7178
04:07:08,590 --> 04:07:10,890
I think the bracket will be...

7179
04:07:10,890 --> 04:07:11,910
We'll have to cook it up.

7180
04:07:11,930 --> 04:07:12,630
It might take a little while.

7181
04:07:13,030 --> 04:07:13,430
Yeah.

7182
04:07:14,550 --> 04:07:15,430
It might be a little bit later.

7183
04:07:15,430 --> 04:07:16,250
It's like, how did the Tekken...

7184
04:07:16,250 --> 04:07:19,350
Do you remember, Brawl Pro, how the Tekken bracket was like?

7185
04:07:19,670 --> 04:07:21,270
I don't remember.

7186
04:07:21,870 --> 04:07:22,770
That was a while ago.

7187
04:07:22,770 --> 04:07:23,110
Season 4, when the game's out.

7188
04:07:23,250 --> 04:07:24,050
It was on his stream.

7189
04:07:24,230 --> 04:07:24,410
Oh.

7190
04:07:24,550 --> 04:07:25,530
He said it's...

7191
04:07:25,530 --> 04:07:26,350
Oh, shit.

7192
04:07:26,390 --> 04:07:26,770
Oh, it's out?

7193
04:07:27,130 --> 04:07:27,650
All right.

7194
04:07:27,650 --> 04:07:28,810
So where is it at?

7195
04:07:29,470 --> 04:07:30,230
Where is it?

7196
04:07:30,670 --> 04:07:31,790
All right, guys, do you know?

7197
04:07:31,930 --> 04:07:32,270
Shine.

7198
04:07:32,450 --> 04:07:32,750
Okay.

7199
04:07:33,870 --> 04:07:35,590
So if we win our first...

7200
04:07:35,590 --> 04:07:36,870
Oh, we have to play Shine again.

7201
04:07:37,730 --> 04:07:38,090
Basically.

7202
04:07:39,030 --> 04:07:40,110
If they win?

7203
04:07:40,270 --> 04:07:41,430
Well, it depends on who wins what.

7204
04:07:41,590 --> 04:07:42,630
So overall, they have to buy.

7205
04:07:42,810 --> 04:07:43,970
So we're going to go into Shine.

7206
04:07:44,130 --> 04:07:49,630
So, we're fighting JB's team and then if we win against JB's team, we have to fight Shine.

7207
04:07:50,050 --> 04:07:50,690
That makes sense.

7208
04:07:50,770 --> 04:07:51,590
Because they have to buy.

7209
04:07:51,630 --> 04:07:51,650
Okay.

7210
04:07:52,330 --> 04:07:55,090
We did pretty good against them today, right?

7211
04:07:55,950 --> 04:07:56,470
We...

7212
04:07:56,470 --> 04:07:59,650
Yeah, because Brian wouldn't have had to...

7213
04:07:59,650 --> 04:08:00,510
I won my...

7214
04:08:02,990 --> 04:08:05,050
Who's the guy I fought on his team?

7215
04:08:05,650 --> 04:08:06,890
You fought...

7216
04:08:07,450 --> 04:08:08,410
Oh no, we tied.

7217
04:08:08,650 --> 04:08:09,190
Who me?

7218
04:08:09,190 --> 04:08:09,810
The JP?

7219
04:08:10,330 --> 04:08:12,070
Oh god, that was so annoying.

7220
04:08:12,410 --> 04:08:13,750
You fought the JP, yeah.

7221
04:08:13,990 --> 04:08:16,970
And then SK fought the ED.

7222
04:08:17,490 --> 04:08:18,850
And then I guess...

7223
04:08:18,850 --> 04:08:20,850
Yeah, and then I don't remember who Chloe fought.

7224
04:08:22,110 --> 04:08:23,070
Who did you fight?

7225
04:08:23,750 --> 04:08:24,730
That's doable, guys.

7226
04:08:24,850 --> 04:08:26,350
We could probably...

7227
04:08:26,350 --> 04:08:29,270
I think I can do that matchup.

7228
04:08:29,550 --> 04:08:29,950
We'll...

7229
04:08:29,950 --> 04:08:31,390
We'll lab two things, dude.

7230
04:08:31,510 --> 04:08:32,910
Like, you got beat by...

7231
04:08:32,910 --> 04:08:33,690
Yeah.

7232
04:08:34,190 --> 04:08:35,790
Cause like, I don't know...

7233
04:08:35,790 --> 04:08:42,910
I don't know, like, how well I'm gonna do on the finals, cause all the beginners are gonna lab against me now.

7234
04:08:43,050 --> 04:08:43,890
So like...

7235
04:08:44,450 --> 04:08:45,710
Okay, you labbed right.

7236
04:08:46,010 --> 04:08:51,910
You know, sometimes I've labbed against you and I've labbed against these players for years and sometimes you just still eat shit.

7237
04:08:52,210 --> 04:08:52,370
You know?

7238
04:08:54,790 --> 04:08:56,850
So much, and see what happened today.

7239
04:08:57,350 --> 04:08:57,790
Yeah.

7240
04:08:58,430 --> 04:08:58,870
True.

7241
04:08:59,170 --> 04:09:01,690
The only one that got close was the Aki player.

7242
04:09:01,910 --> 04:09:03,730
Yeah, cause Aki...

7243
04:09:03,730 --> 04:09:06,830
She played a different playstyle than...

7244
04:09:06,830 --> 04:09:07,910
No, she's not.

7245
04:09:08,450 --> 04:09:11,030
She's definitely a wolf in sheep's clothing, for sure.

7246
04:09:11,130 --> 04:09:11,610
She's not bronze.

7247
04:09:12,030 --> 04:09:13,090
She's way better than bronze.

7248
04:09:13,270 --> 04:09:18,090
She had different combos, and then she actually adapted to my playstyle so I had to like...

7249
04:09:18,850 --> 04:09:20,230
From my understanding...

7250
04:09:20,230 --> 04:09:21,550
She got coached by broski.

7251
04:09:21,830 --> 04:09:24,250
That's the only person I would be concerned about.

7252
04:09:24,590 --> 04:09:26,130
Well yeah, she probably also got coached.

7253
04:09:26,530 --> 04:09:27,650
She got coached by broski.

7254
04:09:27,670 --> 04:09:28,310
Automatic's a really good coach.

7255
04:09:29,170 --> 04:09:30,430
I wouldn't count him out either.

7256
04:09:30,690 --> 04:09:34,830
He knows the game on such a technical level.

7257
04:09:35,070 --> 04:09:36,050
I'd be scared of his team.

7258
04:09:36,170 --> 04:09:37,430
That's a lab rat right there.

7259
04:09:37,670 --> 04:09:40,790
Yeah, he's really good at communicating and giving tech.

7260
04:09:40,930 --> 04:09:41,250
Who's?

7261
04:09:42,290 --> 04:09:42,750
Automatic.

7262
04:09:43,070 --> 04:09:44,970
Oh yeah, I've noticed bro.

7263
04:09:44,970 --> 04:09:47,410
His players will keep leveling up the most.

7264
04:09:47,510 --> 04:09:49,430
I think he'll probably be the most efficient coach.

7265
04:09:49,550 --> 04:09:50,690
And I think he's doing this like...

7266
04:09:50,690 --> 04:09:51,310
He's riding hard.

7267
04:09:53,190 --> 04:09:53,590
100%.

7268
04:09:55,530 --> 04:09:56,770
Yeah, so Saratina...

7269
04:09:56,770 --> 04:09:57,350
Is that who it was?

7270
04:09:57,690 --> 04:09:59,330
She is playing the game for real.

7271
04:09:59,430 --> 04:10:01,390
She'll be really good soon.

7272
04:10:01,770 --> 04:10:02,950
So that's definitely a threat.

7273
04:10:03,750 --> 04:10:05,910
Brian, what do I...

7274
04:10:05,910 --> 04:10:08,970
You said you don't think he's a 1500 MR player.

7275
04:10:09,330 --> 04:10:10,730
What do I do?

7276
04:10:12,410 --> 04:10:12,810
Automatic's...

7277
04:10:12,810 --> 04:10:12,990
Roy?

7278
04:10:15,370 --> 04:10:17,110
I have to play very solid.

7279
04:10:17,590 --> 04:10:18,170
It's like...

7280
04:10:18,170 --> 04:10:19,810
I can't do anything gimmicky.

7281
04:10:20,570 --> 04:10:23,510
Like, you know when you're getting mauled in the corner and you just hate life?

7282
04:10:24,670 --> 04:10:25,710
That's just part of the game, man.

7283
04:10:26,470 --> 04:10:27,250
He's playing the game.

7284
04:10:27,570 --> 04:10:32,250
Sometimes I'm getting mauled in the corner and I manage to fight out and I win and sometimes I don't.

7285
04:10:32,270 --> 04:10:32,970
And that's just the game.

7286
04:10:34,970 --> 04:10:37,030
So you have to really pick your spots.

7287
04:10:37,290 --> 04:10:40,590
And like, for example, you're still not doing Leiried Anti-Air.

7288
04:10:40,670 --> 04:10:42,790
If you do not Leiried Anti-Air, you will not be this good.

7289
04:10:42,810 --> 04:10:43,470
Okay.

7290
04:10:43,910 --> 04:10:49,810
If you block on a wakeup and he neutral jumps to bait your throw and you don't Leiried Anti-Air, you're never getting out of that corner.

7291
04:10:50,170 --> 04:10:50,570
Okay.

7292
04:10:50,810 --> 04:10:53,050
It's getting real now.

7293
04:10:53,350 --> 04:10:56,450
The later rounds, I started doing it a little bit.

7294
04:10:56,710 --> 04:10:57,110
Yeah.

7295
04:10:58,390 --> 04:10:59,850
Yeah, I'll lock that in.

7296
04:11:00,290 --> 04:11:01,830
That is the number one thing.

7297
04:11:01,910 --> 04:11:05,290
You must have these Anti-Airs because that's going to be the only gaps he's going to give you.

7298
04:11:06,610 --> 04:11:07,010
Okay.

7299
04:11:08,870 --> 04:11:10,010
Roy is for real.

7300
04:11:10,050 --> 04:11:10,570
What about me?

7301
04:11:10,570 --> 04:11:12,090
I'm kind of trolling you about him, but he's for real.

7302
04:11:12,810 --> 04:11:13,510
What do I need to do?

7303
04:11:15,170 --> 04:11:16,530
Don't worry, you're...

7304
04:11:16,530 --> 04:11:17,070
Oh, okay.

7305
04:11:19,010 --> 04:11:26,210
Dude, real talk, Doki, they're so afraid of you that anything they learn just goes out the window sometimes, you know?

7306
04:11:26,550 --> 04:11:30,210
Apparently, Sykkuno was raging a little bit.

7307
04:11:30,210 --> 04:11:32,210
He reported me right after.

7308
04:11:32,710 --> 04:11:34,750
I would like the clips of that.

7309
04:11:34,890 --> 04:11:37,370
I would love clips of Sykkuno.

7310
04:11:37,570 --> 04:11:39,330
That guy is too nice for his own good.

7311
04:11:39,330 --> 04:11:40,990
Street Fighter 6 will fix him right now.

7312
04:11:41,030 --> 04:11:42,250
Bro, he's laughing so hard.

7313
04:11:42,570 --> 04:11:44,610
He's like calling on game mates.

7314
04:11:44,710 --> 04:11:47,010
He's like freaking telling viewers to play Zangief.

7315
04:11:47,330 --> 04:11:48,370
That's so fucked.

7316
04:11:53,930 --> 04:11:58,970
Bro, he's actually laughing specifically against Zangief.

7317
04:11:59,630 --> 04:12:02,330
We're not even going to play against each other.

7318
04:12:02,450 --> 04:12:03,490
I don't think it'll matter.

7319
04:12:03,750 --> 04:12:05,870
We're not even going to play.

7320
04:12:06,390 --> 04:12:07,770
Well, you never know.

7321
04:12:07,830 --> 04:12:08,230
Who knows?

7322
04:12:09,830 --> 04:12:11,930
He's fighting modern geese right now, too.

7323
04:12:12,430 --> 04:12:12,870
Yeah.

7324
04:12:13,510 --> 04:12:14,770
Modern geese, dude.

7325
04:12:14,890 --> 04:12:17,010
I mean, yeah.

7326
04:12:17,570 --> 04:12:21,430
You just present a problem that is very difficult to solve when you're new at the game, Doki.

7327
04:12:22,130 --> 04:12:23,550
That's the reality of it.

7328
04:12:23,850 --> 04:12:24,930
That's how it is.

7329
04:12:24,990 --> 04:12:27,590
They're just going to have to get much better, everyone at your tier.

7330
04:12:27,830 --> 04:12:34,430
And like I said, I think Seratina, she's the one who's like most concerned about beating you.

7331
04:12:36,370 --> 04:12:39,070
Is Aki a counter pick to Geek?

7332
04:12:39,070 --> 04:12:39,430
It's not Aki.

7333
04:12:39,490 --> 04:12:40,250
It has nothing to do with Aki.

7334
04:12:40,410 --> 04:12:44,670
This is all 100% universal mechanics and just understanding the flow of the game.

7335
04:12:44,790 --> 04:12:50,590
Seratina is the one player that gets the flow of the game as equal as you or maybe, I don't know.

7336
04:12:50,810 --> 04:12:59,790
I was looking but she hasn't won a single match so I came in with like...

7337
04:12:59,790 --> 04:13:00,910
That's very common.

7338
04:13:01,210 --> 04:13:05,770
If you learn the right way to play in the beginning you might just get overwhelmed by people mashing.

7339
04:13:05,870 --> 04:13:08,910
But eventually you'll get over that hump and you'll steamroll.

7340
04:13:09,930 --> 04:13:10,970
She's playing the long run.

7341
04:13:11,410 --> 04:13:16,190
You're mashing like crazy but you're also starting to pick up the flow of the game really well.

7342
04:13:18,090 --> 04:13:20,170
You're no longer just a mindless masher.

7343
04:13:20,290 --> 04:13:24,430
You're like a scary sort of playing neutral also masher.

7344
04:13:25,390 --> 04:13:28,370
It's very difficult for new players to beat you.

7345
04:13:28,410 --> 04:13:29,470
It's so hard to read you.

7346
04:13:29,870 --> 04:13:30,610
It is.

7347
04:13:30,610 --> 04:13:31,170
It's very...

7348
04:13:31,170 --> 04:13:31,930
You're very unpredictable.

7349
04:13:31,930 --> 04:13:32,570
Yay!

7350
04:13:34,470 --> 04:13:34,950
Yeah.

7351
04:13:35,090 --> 04:13:36,890
We played Team JB first.

7352
04:13:37,590 --> 04:13:39,610
I think we can lab it.

7353
04:13:39,910 --> 04:13:40,390
Okay.

7354
04:13:41,110 --> 04:13:42,370
Which one is Team JB?

7355
04:13:43,110 --> 04:13:44,750
It's the S-Fan team.

7356
04:13:44,930 --> 04:13:45,630
It's F-San.

7357
04:13:47,050 --> 04:13:47,530
Cosmonaut.

7358
04:13:49,330 --> 04:13:50,330
We 4-0'd them.

7359
04:13:50,330 --> 04:13:52,490
We played them first every single time.

7360
04:13:52,790 --> 04:13:53,390
That's true.

7361
04:13:56,050 --> 04:13:59,050
S-Fan does 0-10 but he's playing alright.

7362
04:13:59,910 --> 04:14:00,710
He's not playing bad.

7363
04:14:00,710 --> 04:14:00,810
He's playing good.

7364
04:14:01,050 --> 04:14:01,810
Don't cut him out.

7365
04:14:02,990 --> 04:14:05,470
He's also getting additional coaching by Justin too.

7366
04:14:05,850 --> 04:14:10,350
And when I play S-Fan next time, I just think he won't fireball.

7367
04:14:10,530 --> 04:14:15,270
He would've won but he fireballed and I just reacted to it and jackhammered or whatever.

7368
04:14:15,530 --> 04:14:19,090
With S-Fan, he has played fighting games for a long time actually.

7369
04:14:19,250 --> 04:14:20,450
I think he's just set in his ways.

7370
04:14:20,670 --> 04:14:21,790
He's a boomer.

7371
04:14:22,210 --> 04:14:23,570
He's a boomer fighting game player.

7372
04:14:23,730 --> 04:14:28,870
You'll run into them and they have habits from 15 plus years of doing the same patterns.

7373
04:14:29,190 --> 04:14:32,210
So if something works against them, just keep doing it.

7374
04:14:32,690 --> 04:14:33,570
He might change.

7375
04:14:34,190 --> 04:14:34,730
There's hope.

7376
04:14:35,330 --> 04:14:37,750
But I see this time and time again, dude.

7377
04:14:38,170 --> 04:14:42,450
You'll fight people who have been playing Ryu for 40 years and they do the same thing over and over no matter what.

7378
04:14:43,750 --> 04:14:48,450
Old man Ryu with the cigarette in his mouth and just mashing away, dude.

7379
04:14:48,910 --> 04:14:50,850
Those level 2's are pretty sick though.

7380
04:14:50,970 --> 04:14:53,150
I was like Nah, those were clean, bro.

7381
04:14:53,270 --> 04:14:54,330
Your matches were nuts.

7382
04:14:55,190 --> 04:14:56,050
You were styling.

7383
04:14:56,290 --> 04:14:56,710
It was great.

7384
04:14:58,770 --> 04:15:00,450
Guys, let's serve our Sykkuno on.

7385
04:15:00,510 --> 04:15:01,270
I'm gonna scare him.

7386
04:15:03,450 --> 04:15:04,930
A jump scare?

7387
04:15:05,070 --> 04:15:05,750
Nah, dude.

7388
04:15:05,790 --> 04:15:06,210
You're evil.

7389
04:15:07,990 --> 04:15:09,270
He's in the battle of.

7390
04:15:09,690 --> 04:15:12,130
He's in the battle of right now.

7391
04:15:13,350 --> 04:15:14,190
Whaddup, Sajam?

7392
04:15:14,370 --> 04:15:14,890
Thank you.

7393
04:15:15,170 --> 04:15:16,550
He's congratulating us.

7394
04:15:17,350 --> 04:15:18,270
Oh, he is?

7395
04:15:19,350 --> 04:15:20,590
Nice job, gamers.

7396
04:15:20,590 --> 04:15:21,150
Thank you, Jamman.

7397
04:15:21,390 --> 04:15:22,570
Yeah, good stuff running the event.

7398
04:15:23,150 --> 04:15:24,010
It's been fun.

7399
04:15:24,970 --> 04:15:25,890
It was fun.

7400
04:15:26,770 --> 04:15:32,530
Yeah, so do you guys want, like, more notes or anything, or just try to sync up tomorrow?

7401
04:15:33,670 --> 04:15:35,310
Does anyone care about the written stuff?

7402
04:15:35,350 --> 04:15:38,710
I want, like, notes on, I guess, like, Shine's team.

7403
04:15:38,850 --> 04:15:50,890
I think Gumi, I sort of understand how she plays now, but I think, like, if it kind of stops jumping, I might be like, I might get a little confused if she stops jumping.

7404
04:15:51,550 --> 04:15:51,990
Right.

7405
04:15:52,090 --> 04:15:52,430
Yeah.

7406
04:15:52,530 --> 04:15:55,870
Cause, like, I'm basically taking advantage of her jumps, basically.

7407
04:15:56,610 --> 04:15:57,010
Yeah.

7408
04:15:57,230 --> 04:16:01,490
I honestly think she will keep doing that, and I think we just get even better at beating that.

7409
04:16:01,630 --> 04:16:02,310
That's what I think.

7410
04:16:04,250 --> 04:16:11,210
I'm probably gonna lab against Cosmonaut's Ken just to see how he plays, cause even though, like, I won both times, I'm still, I don't want any surprises.

7411
04:16:12,150 --> 04:16:17,530
The only thing you gotta lab, dude, is medium, medium punch, cancelled into light demon flip into the chop.

7412
04:16:18,190 --> 04:16:21,630
He does it over and over, and when he comes down, he does it...

7413
04:16:22,150 --> 04:16:23,690
This is for Cosmonaut, his Ken.

7414
04:16:24,450 --> 04:16:25,430
Oh, Cosmonaut.

7415
04:16:25,890 --> 04:16:34,810
Both times, but I'm still, like, I still wanna be prepared, and then, oh, absolutely, I need to lab out that Akuma magic, for sure.

7416
04:16:34,990 --> 04:16:36,130
Yeah, you should beat him.

7417
04:16:36,590 --> 04:16:39,690
I might even try and do, like, the jump back stuff that you were saying.

7418
04:16:41,690 --> 04:16:43,630
Like against, like, demon flip chop.

7419
04:16:45,230 --> 04:16:47,150
Is that him?

7420
04:16:47,410 --> 04:16:47,570
Huh?

7421
04:16:48,910 --> 04:16:51,110
Someone made a meme, I haven't watched it yet, though.

7422
04:16:51,250 --> 04:16:51,950
Is this Sykkuno?

7423
04:16:52,930 --> 04:16:53,410
Okay.

7424
04:16:55,870 --> 04:16:56,650
Sykkuno hunting.

7425
04:16:57,670 --> 04:16:59,450
I'm gonna be packing it up here, squad.

7426
04:16:59,830 --> 04:17:01,050
Good shit, everybody, today.

7427
04:17:02,070 --> 04:17:03,310
I'm gonna quit stream.

7428
04:17:03,750 --> 04:17:04,230
GG.

7429
04:17:06,150 --> 04:17:06,790
GG's, everybody.

7430
04:17:07,250 --> 04:17:07,870
GG's, guys.

7431
04:17:08,210 --> 04:17:09,350
Good luck with the labs.

7432
04:17:09,810 --> 04:17:10,210
GG's.

7433
04:17:11,150 --> 04:17:14,010
I'll be on tomorrow, so let's sync up, let's do whatever.

7434
04:17:15,350 --> 04:17:16,270
Let's get it done.

7435
04:17:17,590 --> 04:17:18,070
Alright.

7436
04:17:18,070 --> 04:17:18,950
Alright, guys.

7437
04:17:19,430 --> 04:17:20,270
Have a good one, guys.

7438
04:17:20,870 --> 04:17:21,450
Bye-bye.

7439
04:17:23,510 --> 04:17:23,950
Okay.

7440
04:17:25,110 --> 04:17:28,030
I was surprised how well I did today.

7441
04:17:29,190 --> 04:17:30,070
I mean...

7442
04:17:30,070 --> 04:17:33,190
I mean, we're gonna be playing as JB, so I'm not too worried.

7443
04:17:33,530 --> 04:17:34,670
I mean, I don't know, actually.

7444
04:17:34,690 --> 04:17:35,110
I don't know.

7445
04:17:35,350 --> 04:17:38,690
It depends on how hard they lab against me.

7446
04:17:38,850 --> 04:17:40,410
Oh, well done!

7447
04:17:40,490 --> 04:17:40,990
That's me!

7448
04:17:41,790 --> 04:17:44,150
Your fans are congratulating me!

7449
04:17:44,470 --> 04:17:44,910
Sykkuno!

7450
04:17:50,330 --> 04:17:50,810
Yippee!

7451
04:17:52,210 --> 04:17:52,690
Yippee!

7452
04:17:53,650 --> 04:17:54,530
Oh, my God.

7453
04:17:54,550 --> 04:17:55,430
I was very surprised.

7454
04:17:55,730 --> 04:18:00,850
Honestly, I'm very surprised I managed to 5-0 today.

7455
04:18:00,990 --> 04:18:03,370
I think I'm like the only beginner that 5-hoed.

7456
04:18:03,590 --> 04:18:08,010
So, like, I did not expect that because I don't know what I'm doing.

7457
04:18:08,270 --> 04:18:09,370
I don't know!

7458
04:18:09,830 --> 04:18:15,250
Like, people think I have a strategy going in, but I'm playing very reactive.

7459
04:18:17,010 --> 04:18:17,830
I'm just...

7460
04:18:18,070 --> 04:18:20,430
I'm just playing super reactive when I'm...

7461
04:18:20,430 --> 04:18:23,370
when I'm playing Street Fighter.

7462
04:18:24,810 --> 04:18:27,350
So, like, I'm very... I was very surprised.

7463
04:18:28,350 --> 04:18:31,030
But, yeah, I think, like, as long as my team... I don't know.

7464
04:18:31,150 --> 04:18:35,990
The thing I'm worried about is that everybody is, like, labbing... will be labbing against me.

7465
04:18:36,090 --> 04:18:38,090
So, like, that's what I'm really worried about.

7466
04:18:41,710 --> 04:18:45,290
I don't give a fuck what Street Fighter would play.

7467
04:18:45,290 --> 04:18:48,550
I play safe.

7468
04:18:49,550 --> 04:18:53,430
Because, like, they're easier...

7469
04:18:53,430 --> 04:18:57,430
A lot of the characters that people are playing requires you to jump.

7470
04:18:57,630 --> 04:18:59,230
Like, it requires them to jump.

7471
04:18:59,510 --> 04:19:02,130
And, like, I'm very good at, like, countering jumps.

7472
04:19:03,490 --> 04:19:05,870
Yep, he's gonna, like, lab me.

7473
04:19:10,050 --> 04:19:11,170
Okay, Axis.

7474
04:19:11,990 --> 04:19:12,990
Join queue.

7475
04:19:13,170 --> 04:19:13,550
No!

7476
04:19:14,070 --> 04:19:15,030
Everybody's joining!

7477
04:19:15,290 --> 04:19:16,470
I can't!

7478
04:19:17,070 --> 04:19:18,350
Everybody's in the queue!

7479
04:19:24,030 --> 04:19:25,910
I don't think he noticed.

7480
04:19:26,290 --> 04:19:28,530
I don't think he noticed.

7481
04:19:29,110 --> 04:19:31,130
No, the queue is huge!

7482
04:19:33,770 --> 04:19:35,170
How's he doing, though?

7483
04:19:35,250 --> 04:19:35,850
Is he okay?

7484
04:19:36,210 --> 04:19:38,050
I don't understand why he's labbing me!

7485
04:19:38,170 --> 04:19:39,430
We're not gonna fight!

7486
04:19:39,650 --> 04:19:40,570
That's the thing!

7487
04:19:41,030 --> 04:19:43,070
Like, I don't know why!

7488
04:19:43,250 --> 04:19:52,230
Like, we're not gonna be matched up at all, so there's, like, no reason for him to have to lab against me!

7489
04:19:53,990 --> 04:19:55,210
He's literally not!

7490
04:19:55,390 --> 04:19:59,430
Like, I play Gumi, and then I play Kanna.

7491
04:19:59,650 --> 04:20:02,210
Like, we're not matching up!

7492
04:20:02,450 --> 04:20:05,150
Like, he's not even gonna see me at TwitchCon!

7493
04:20:05,350 --> 04:20:07,330
Like, he's not gonna fight me at TwitchCon!

7494
04:20:07,450 --> 04:20:08,830
That's the thing!

7495
04:20:11,070 --> 04:20:12,810
I broke him!

7496
04:20:15,390 --> 04:20:17,830
You might break him right now!

7497
04:20:18,430 --> 04:20:19,690
Oh my god!

7498
04:20:20,630 --> 04:20:23,970
It's not about the tournament at that point!

7499
04:20:27,290 --> 04:20:29,690
Bro, he already beat a Gief, though!

7500
04:20:31,710 --> 04:20:34,350
Like, there's no way he has not won!

7501
04:20:34,430 --> 04:20:34,770
No, see?

7502
04:20:34,890 --> 04:20:35,890
He already beat a Gief!

7503
04:20:35,970 --> 04:20:37,910
Not every Gief knows what they're doing!

7504
04:20:39,950 --> 04:20:41,430
Oh, that's embarrassing.

7505
04:20:42,730 --> 04:20:44,350
It's personal now.

7506
04:20:45,770 --> 04:20:52,650
Also, guys, I won't be streaming it, but I got invited to a collab for tomorrow.

7507
04:20:52,950 --> 04:20:54,110
I think it's Monopoly?

7508
04:20:54,310 --> 04:20:55,510
I don't know who's streaming it.

7509
04:20:55,910 --> 04:20:58,090
I think it's, like, EleM invited me.

7510
04:20:58,390 --> 04:21:06,030
It was really sweet of him, because he was like, EleM from Twitch Rivals yesterday, he was like, Oh, you're so funny!

7511
04:21:06,110 --> 04:21:06,810
You wanna do this collab?

7512
04:21:07,110 --> 04:21:07,850
And I was like, okay.

7513
04:21:07,970 --> 04:21:13,930
It's like Monopoly with him, NiceWig, Sykkuno, and IronMouse.

7514
04:21:14,290 --> 04:21:17,330
So, I won't be streaming it, but I'll be showing up.

7515
04:21:17,730 --> 04:21:25,410
He even tried to invite me to like, a lockdown protocol collab today, but I was like, I can't, buddy.

7516
04:21:25,510 --> 04:21:27,150
I have to do Street Fighter.

7517
04:21:30,470 --> 04:21:32,490
Oh, poor Sykkuno!

7518
04:21:33,190 --> 04:21:35,130
Oh, that shit's toxic.

7519
04:21:41,430 --> 04:21:44,970
Oh, that shit's toxic!

7520
04:21:45,630 --> 04:21:46,550
Damn!

7521
04:21:49,750 --> 04:21:51,890
Oh my god!

7522
04:21:51,950 --> 04:21:55,190
That shit is so toxic!

7523
04:21:57,290 --> 04:21:59,410
Holy fuck!

7524
04:21:59,930 --> 04:22:01,890
Oh my god!

7525
04:22:02,430 --> 04:22:04,010
Wait, where did Sykkuno go?

7526
04:22:04,350 --> 04:22:05,490
Where did he go?

7527
04:22:06,330 --> 04:22:07,530
Is that him?

7528
04:22:07,970 --> 04:22:08,310
Hey.

7529
04:22:13,050 --> 04:22:13,530
No!

7530
04:22:13,870 --> 04:22:16,170
I wanted to join you!

7531
04:22:16,610 --> 04:22:18,110
Oh, I'm on the... Oh, nice.

7532
04:22:18,190 --> 04:22:18,490
Okay.

7533
04:22:20,510 --> 04:22:20,990
Um...

7534
04:22:21,750 --> 04:22:22,230
Sure.

7535
04:22:24,570 --> 04:22:25,210
There we go.

7536
04:22:25,870 --> 04:22:26,350
EG.

7537
04:22:29,230 --> 04:22:33,390
No, guys, I'm gonna do something really...

7538
04:22:34,730 --> 04:22:37,190
Guys, I'm gonna do something super toxic.

7539
04:22:49,690 --> 04:22:53,110
Please stop harassing this poor man.

7540
04:22:53,710 --> 04:22:56,670
No, no, it's gonna be worse than a one and done.

7541
04:23:01,270 --> 04:23:02,430
Oh, man.

7542
04:23:03,430 --> 04:23:09,550
I'm just surprised that I... I'm... Like, I was even the only person he lost against.

7543
04:23:09,890 --> 04:23:10,050
I...

7544
04:23:13,590 --> 04:23:15,230
Like, I don't understand.

7545
04:23:15,610 --> 04:23:17,910
He lost against... Who did he lose to?

7546
04:23:18,510 --> 04:23:19,770
He lost to...

7547
04:23:19,770 --> 04:23:21,410
Okay, where's Sykkuno's matchup?

7548
04:23:21,450 --> 04:23:22,090
Okay, pink.

7549
04:23:22,490 --> 04:23:25,670
He lost to... He lost to Shine as well!

7550
04:23:26,690 --> 04:23:27,630
He lost...

7551
04:23:27,630 --> 04:23:28,550
He lost to Shine!

7552
04:23:29,950 --> 04:23:31,230
And... Oh, wait, and me.

7553
04:23:31,350 --> 04:23:31,890
That's me.

7554
04:23:33,230 --> 04:23:33,910
That's me.

7555
04:23:34,090 --> 04:23:34,650
Yeah.

7556
04:23:36,650 --> 04:23:37,210
Yeah.

7557
04:23:37,650 --> 04:23:38,470
He lost to Shine.

7558
04:23:39,330 --> 04:23:40,550
I broke him.

7559
04:23:47,530 --> 04:23:48,530
That's pretty funny.

7560
04:23:50,250 --> 04:23:51,230
I'm just happy.

7561
04:23:51,870 --> 04:23:56,950
I'm just happy that I did the best because a lot of people think I'm not that great at fighting games.

7562
04:23:57,290 --> 04:23:59,510
So, like, this is to prove the haters wrong.

7563
04:24:00,470 --> 04:24:02,730
I still am not that good at fighting games.

7564
04:24:03,010 --> 04:24:05,950
But, like, my one moment to Shine.

7565
04:24:06,370 --> 04:24:09,410
My one moment to Shine.

7566
04:24:10,570 --> 04:24:11,130
Yeah.

7567
04:24:16,850 --> 04:24:18,750
I opened my third eye.

7568
04:24:20,350 --> 04:24:20,910
Um...

7569
04:24:21,490 --> 04:24:22,970
Am I having fun with Street Fighter?

7570
04:24:23,270 --> 04:24:26,190
I think... I still think King is more fun to play.

7571
04:24:26,410 --> 04:24:27,650
Because, like, the reason...

7572
04:24:27,650 --> 04:24:33,830
The difference between me playing King and me playing Zangief... Like, I actually have to be very aware of what I'm doing.

7573
04:24:34,110 --> 04:24:35,910
So, like, um...

7574
04:24:36,870 --> 04:24:39,530
I have to be... I have to... I still have...

7575
04:24:39,530 --> 04:24:42,130
I have to, like, think reactively.

7576
04:24:42,130 --> 04:24:45,690
As King, I... It's very easy to button mash.

7577
04:24:45,990 --> 04:24:47,350
So, like, I'm...

7578
04:24:47,350 --> 04:24:48,830
I'm more... I like that.

7579
04:24:48,970 --> 04:24:49,370
Like...

7580
04:24:49,990 --> 04:24:52,970
I like... There's more cheese when it comes to King.

7581
04:24:53,270 --> 04:24:56,410
And, like, the game is much more fast-paced.

7582
04:24:56,470 --> 04:24:58,330
Playing King lets me play super fast.

7583
04:24:58,630 --> 04:25:02,770
Playing Zangief, I have to balance between fast-paced and slow.

7584
04:25:02,950 --> 04:25:04,130
And I hate that.

7585
04:25:04,250 --> 04:25:04,490
Like...

7586
04:25:06,610 --> 04:25:09,170
Like, I play King super head-empty.

7587
04:25:09,310 --> 04:25:11,770
But on Zangief, like, I can have a conversation.

7588
04:25:12,170 --> 04:25:15,430
I can have a conversation while playing King at the same time.

7589
04:25:15,650 --> 04:25:18,850
Because, like, I can literally be, like, like, head-empty and stuff.

7590
04:25:20,710 --> 04:25:26,210
Um... But, uh... For Zangief, I actually have to focus and be like, okay, what is he gonna do?

7591
04:25:26,690 --> 04:25:28,570
What do I think he's gonna do next?

7592
04:25:28,670 --> 04:25:30,430
I do a lot of prediction on Zangief.

7593
04:25:30,450 --> 04:25:31,590
Like, I do reads a lot.

7594
04:25:31,670 --> 04:25:33,290
Like, a lot of people say, like, wow, she's...

7595
04:25:33,290 --> 04:25:38,270
Because, like, people said that I was very lucky with the... with that throw on the first round.

7596
04:25:38,390 --> 04:25:39,950
Oh my god, Sykkun, and that's...

7597
04:25:40,750 --> 04:25:43,330
People say I did it, like, luck.

7598
04:25:43,450 --> 04:25:45,270
But, like, I... It was reflex.

7599
04:25:45,770 --> 04:25:49,290
It was... Like, not reflex, but it was, like, um...

7600
04:25:50,170 --> 04:25:51,770
Wait, who am I requesting to fight?

7601
04:25:51,970 --> 04:25:53,290
I don't... Oh, no.

7602
04:25:53,350 --> 04:25:53,750
Not you.

7603
04:25:55,630 --> 04:25:56,570
Wait, where's...

7604
04:25:56,570 --> 04:25:57,510
Where's Sykkun?

7605
04:25:58,910 --> 04:25:59,390
No!

7606
04:25:59,590 --> 04:26:00,910
I wanted to fight!

7607
04:26:00,910 --> 04:26:01,030
I...

7608
04:26:02,190 --> 04:26:02,910
No!

7609
04:26:03,250 --> 04:26:04,810
I lost a cube!

7610
04:26:05,490 --> 04:26:07,110
I lost it!

7611
04:26:09,170 --> 04:26:11,550
Wait, where is he?

7612
04:26:11,790 --> 04:26:12,850
Where did he go?

7613
04:26:12,970 --> 04:26:13,810
I lost it!

7614
04:26:14,670 --> 04:26:15,030
No!

7615
04:26:15,490 --> 04:26:17,150
Wait, did he...

7616
04:26:18,390 --> 04:26:21,890
Wait, he left?

7617
04:26:22,610 --> 04:26:23,330
No!

7618
04:26:25,330 --> 04:26:27,910
He actually left.

7619
04:26:28,570 --> 04:26:29,290
Bro...

7620
04:26:30,910 --> 04:26:31,170
Fuck.

7621
04:26:31,170 --> 04:26:32,310
I can't believe he...

7622
04:26:32,310 --> 04:26:33,170
He joined!

7623
04:26:33,550 --> 04:26:34,670
Wait, which server?

7624
04:26:34,970 --> 04:26:35,830
Which server?

7625
04:26:36,010 --> 04:26:37,110
I wanna fight him!

7626
04:26:37,150 --> 04:26:38,270
Which server is he?

7627
04:26:38,910 --> 04:26:39,410
He...

7628
04:26:40,530 --> 04:26:43,450
Oh, there he is.

7629
04:26:43,630 --> 04:26:44,370
Oh my god.

7630
04:26:44,390 --> 04:26:45,330
There he is.

7631
04:26:45,610 --> 04:26:46,350
Oh my god.

7632
04:26:46,410 --> 04:26:47,430
I just wanna do the thing.

7633
04:26:47,550 --> 04:26:47,810
I just...

7634
04:26:47,810 --> 04:26:50,090
I just wanna do the thing.

7635
04:26:50,170 --> 04:26:53,070
I wanna leave and do the thing.

7636
04:26:53,270 --> 04:26:54,690
Oh, I think everybody joined the queue.

7637
04:26:57,670 --> 04:26:58,670
You menace.

7638
04:26:58,710 --> 04:27:00,850
I just wanna... I just wanna...

7639
04:27:00,910 --> 04:27:01,570
I just wanna do the thing.

7640
04:27:01,770 --> 04:27:04,430
Oh my god, this queue is too fucking long.

7641
04:27:04,650 --> 04:27:05,830
This queue...

7642
04:27:05,830 --> 04:27:08,910
This queue is too long.

7643
04:27:09,210 --> 04:27:10,210
I can't...

7644
04:27:12,890 --> 04:27:14,590
They're protecting him.

7645
04:27:16,030 --> 04:27:17,130
Wait, but...

7646
04:27:17,130 --> 04:27:20,750
Didn't he say he'll end the stream after he wins against the GEEF?

7647
04:27:21,050 --> 04:27:22,650
Like, didn't he say that?

7648
04:27:24,090 --> 04:27:25,450
And he's still streaming.

7649
04:27:26,790 --> 04:27:28,290
Like, he's still stream...

7650
04:27:37,680 --> 04:27:38,360
Alright...

7651
04:27:38,360 --> 04:27:38,640
Alright...

7652
04:27:42,040 --> 04:27:42,720
Alright...

7653
04:27:42,720 --> 04:27:44,440
Wait, has he actually?

7654
04:27:44,960 --> 04:27:45,020
Wait, has he actually?

7655
04:27:45,020 --> 04:27:46,460
Oh my god.

7656
04:27:47,180 --> 04:27:48,500
I feel bad.

7657
04:27:49,640 --> 04:27:51,800
Like, I mind broke this guy.

7658
04:27:52,640 --> 04:27:53,320
Like...

7659
04:27:53,320 --> 04:27:55,940
Holy shit!

7660
04:27:56,260 --> 04:28:00,260
He did that on... Bro!

7661
04:28:00,900 --> 04:28:04,120
Bro, even Braum doesn't know how to do this on Classic!

7662
04:28:04,500 --> 04:28:05,060
Oh my god!

7663
04:28:05,080 --> 04:28:07,900
He's so... Bro, this guy's better than me!

7664
04:28:08,800 --> 04:28:10,940
Bro, he's actually...

7665
04:28:10,940 --> 04:28:12,240
Oh my god!

7666
04:28:12,300 --> 04:28:15,260
He's actually... He's still queueing.

7667
04:28:15,420 --> 04:28:17,720
Bro, this guy is better than me!

7668
04:28:18,180 --> 04:28:19,680
He's a legit GEEF.

7669
04:28:19,780 --> 04:28:21,980
The fact that he did it on Classic was insane.

7670
04:28:22,520 --> 04:28:25,100
Cause Braum doesn't know how to do it on Classic.

7671
04:28:26,380 --> 04:28:26,980
Like...

7672
04:28:27,740 --> 04:28:28,340
Like...

7673
04:28:28,940 --> 04:28:29,740
He's dead.

7674
04:28:31,000 --> 04:28:32,200
Real GEEF.

7675
04:28:32,200 --> 04:28:33,420
Yeah...

7676
04:28:36,540 --> 04:28:39,500
Oh my god!

7677
04:28:42,240 --> 04:28:43,880
Holy shit!

7678
04:28:44,140 --> 04:28:45,460
Poor guy!

7679
04:28:45,940 --> 04:28:47,240
Poor guy!

7680
04:28:48,260 --> 04:28:50,320
Bro, he doesn't deserve this.

7681
04:28:50,520 --> 04:28:53,600
He actually doesn't deserve this.

7682
04:28:53,700 --> 04:28:54,280
Is he okay?

7683
04:28:55,020 --> 04:28:56,740
Like, Kudo, are you okay?

7684
04:28:57,040 --> 04:28:58,780
Are you okay?

7685
04:28:58,780 --> 04:28:59,360
Okay...

7686
04:29:05,260 --> 04:29:07,300
Does he want to fight me?

7687
04:29:07,520 --> 04:29:08,920
I'm literally the GEEF...

7688
04:29:08,920 --> 04:29:12,340
Like, the GEEF that he wants to beat.

7689
04:29:15,740 --> 04:29:16,340
Okay...

7690
04:29:17,340 --> 04:29:17,940
Alright...

7691
04:29:18,640 --> 04:29:21,000
I waited so long to do this.

7692
04:29:21,220 --> 04:29:23,140
I waited so long...

7693
04:29:23,140 --> 04:29:24,700
to do this.

7694
04:29:24,820 --> 04:29:25,020
Wait!

7695
04:29:25,200 --> 04:29:25,980
This is not...

7696
04:29:25,980 --> 04:29:27,320
This is not Sykkuno.

7697
04:29:28,160 --> 04:29:29,060
This is...

7698
04:29:30,680 --> 04:29:31,240
Whoops!

7699
04:29:33,300 --> 04:29:33,860
Alright!

7700
04:29:34,080 --> 04:29:35,280
GEEF versus GEEF.

7701
04:29:35,340 --> 04:29:36,200
Let's let him go.

7702
04:29:38,100 --> 04:29:41,500
I think fighting a GEEF is so funny.

7703
04:29:41,640 --> 04:29:44,020
Like, the mirror match between two GEEFs.

7704
04:29:44,420 --> 04:29:45,300
Oh my god!

7705
04:29:45,320 --> 04:29:46,760
This guy actually knows what he's doing, though.

7706
04:29:55,300 --> 04:29:57,100
The GEEF versus GEEF.

7707
04:29:57,400 --> 04:29:58,740
It's so goofy.

7708
04:29:58,900 --> 04:30:00,760
It's actually so goofy.

7709
04:30:02,440 --> 04:30:03,240
Oh my god!

7710
04:30:03,260 --> 04:30:04,120
This guy knows what he's doing.

7711
04:30:04,260 --> 04:30:06,200
He's a classic GEEF player, guys!

7712
04:30:06,460 --> 04:30:09,620
This guy was gonna beat the shit out of Sykkuno no matter what!

7713
04:30:18,340 --> 04:30:19,420
He's on classic.

7714
04:30:19,440 --> 04:30:20,040
He knows.

7715
04:30:21,580 --> 04:30:23,180
Bro, he actually knows.

7716
04:30:23,300 --> 04:30:24,680
This is like me fighting BrawlPro.

7717
04:30:28,900 --> 04:30:30,120
Oh my god.

7718
04:30:32,160 --> 04:30:32,640
Wait.

7719
04:30:32,780 --> 04:30:33,920
Oh, I'm not green.

7720
04:30:34,060 --> 04:30:35,540
I thought I was green for a sec.

7721
04:30:35,800 --> 04:30:36,820
Guys, he's good.

7722
04:30:36,980 --> 04:30:39,060
He actually knows what he's doing, guys.

7723
04:30:41,400 --> 04:30:42,000
What?

7724
04:30:42,100 --> 04:30:42,580
What is that?

7725
04:30:43,500 --> 04:30:44,340
What is that?

7726
04:30:44,520 --> 04:30:45,040
Oh my god!

7727
04:30:45,060 --> 04:30:45,480
He jumps!

7728
04:30:46,700 --> 04:30:47,300
GG's.

7729
04:30:47,460 --> 04:30:48,540
There was no way.

7730
04:30:49,200 --> 04:30:51,280
That steal is dead!

7731
04:30:59,160 --> 04:31:00,760
Okay, where is he?

7732
04:31:01,840 --> 04:31:02,900
Where is he?

7733
04:31:03,780 --> 04:31:05,500
Where is he?

7734
04:31:05,660 --> 04:31:06,680
Oh my god!

7735
04:31:06,700 --> 04:31:07,520
He jumps!

7736
04:31:08,700 --> 04:31:09,600
Where the fuck is he?

7737
04:31:09,620 --> 04:31:10,120
Where the fuck did he go?

7738
04:31:14,260 --> 04:31:16,120
That GEEF butted in!

7739
04:31:21,110 --> 04:31:22,470
Okay, where is he?

7740
04:31:22,850 --> 04:31:23,830
Don't worry, guys.

7741
04:31:24,150 --> 04:31:25,990
I know what I'm gonna do.

7742
04:31:26,770 --> 04:31:27,590
Where the fuck?

7743
04:31:28,010 --> 04:31:30,830
Bro, he was definitely not gonna win against that GEEF.

7744
04:31:30,930 --> 04:31:34,050
That GEEF actually knows what the fuck he's doing.

7745
04:31:35,110 --> 04:31:36,430
There was no way.

7746
04:31:37,170 --> 04:31:41,110
The GEEF I just fought knew exactly how to play.

7747
04:31:41,490 --> 04:31:42,650
Oh, there he is.

7748
04:31:42,750 --> 04:31:43,690
Alright, let's go.

7749
04:31:45,770 --> 04:31:46,370
Alright.

7750
04:31:46,510 --> 04:31:48,810
I'm gonna do something very toxic, guys.

7751
04:31:49,150 --> 04:31:49,770
I'm gonna...

7752
04:31:54,370 --> 04:31:55,510
I'm gonna...

7753
04:31:58,450 --> 04:31:59,650
Watch this.

7754
04:32:01,350 --> 04:32:03,470
I'm gonna do something very toxic.

7755
04:32:04,510 --> 04:32:04,810
...

7756
04:32:04,810 --> 04:32:05,070
...

7757
04:32:05,070 --> 04:32:06,070
...

7758
04:32:07,270 --> 04:32:07,790
...

7759
04:32:09,450 --> 04:32:09,970
...

7760
04:32:14,250 --> 04:32:15,590
Okay, watch this.

7761
04:32:17,350 --> 04:32:19,770
Oh, wait, actually let me just do this real fast, though.

7762
04:32:19,930 --> 04:32:20,450
...

7763
04:32:20,450 --> 04:32:25,050
Let me just do this real fast.

7764
04:32:25,370 --> 04:32:25,890
...

7765
04:32:25,890 --> 04:32:26,650
...

7766
04:32:30,450 --> 04:32:30,970
Okay.

7767
04:32:36,770 --> 04:32:40,110
Oh okay, I just needed to...

7768
04:32:43,650 --> 04:32:44,350
Alright.

7769
04:32:46,970 --> 04:32:47,710
Goodbye!

7770
04:32:54,720 --> 04:32:55,540
Whoa!

7771
04:32:58,040 --> 04:33:00,840
Watch this.

7772
04:33:19,450 --> 04:33:20,490
No way!

7773
04:33:37,060 --> 04:33:39,460
You can't kill me one round in a row.

7774
04:33:39,540 --> 04:33:40,480
You can't unplug your internet!

7775
04:33:41,300 --> 04:33:42,500
That's not legal!

7776
04:33:43,100 --> 04:33:44,140
What the?

7777
04:33:46,360 --> 04:33:47,760
I couldn't choose.

7778
04:33:48,060 --> 04:33:51,360
Who is this guy?

7779
04:33:51,820 --> 04:33:52,500
What the?

7780
04:33:53,260 --> 04:33:54,680
Is that Chipotle Burrito?

7781
04:33:57,440 --> 04:33:58,760
I waited.

7782
04:33:59,120 --> 04:34:00,540
I waited a whole...

7783
04:34:00,540 --> 04:34:03,860
I waited a whole time to do this!

7784
04:34:09,540 --> 04:34:10,320
If I could do this once.

7785
04:34:12,000 --> 04:34:13,480
This is insane man.

7786
04:34:13,720 --> 04:34:14,420
That is insane.

7787
04:34:16,040 --> 04:34:17,260
How do you play this game?

7788
04:34:17,440 --> 04:34:19,080
How does anybody play this game?

7789
04:34:19,080 --> 04:34:19,600
Look at that guy!

7790
04:34:19,720 --> 04:34:20,240
That's me!

7791
04:34:20,820 --> 04:34:22,240
That looks like Zangief.

7792
04:34:22,340 --> 04:34:23,940
That's a picture of me right now.

7793
04:34:24,600 --> 04:34:26,120
George thank you for the superchat.

7794
04:34:26,480 --> 04:34:27,540
You're so nice.

7795
04:34:27,720 --> 04:34:27,740
Smile while you play everybody.

7796
04:34:27,780 --> 04:34:27,940
You gonna die?

7797
04:34:28,020 --> 04:34:30,280
I didn't learn how to play.

7798
04:34:31,720 --> 04:34:34,420
How many Q's has he FOUGHT so far?

7799
04:34:34,980 --> 04:34:35,620
He has a green ring.

7800
04:34:35,720 --> 04:34:36,520
He has a green ring.

7801
04:34:36,540 --> 04:34:36,920
You're so crazy!

7802
04:34:36,920 --> 04:34:37,420
That's mine.

7803
04:34:38,580 --> 04:34:39,520
Your so crazy.

7804
04:34:39,520 --> 04:34:40,480
So evil.

7805
04:34:40,880 --> 04:34:42,800
Alright, that's how I want to end today's stream.

7806
04:34:43,080 --> 04:34:45,440
GG's everybody, we 5-0'd today.

7807
04:34:45,560 --> 04:34:47,320
I did pretty well in the beauty's division.

7808
04:34:48,800 --> 04:34:51,060
Thank you all for supporting and watching!

7809
04:34:51,420 --> 04:34:52,560
I really appreciate it.

7810
04:34:52,680 --> 04:34:57,180
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture checked, get up, and move around to get that blood flowing.

7811
04:34:57,360 --> 04:35:00,760
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

7812
04:35:00,820 --> 04:35:02,300
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

7813
04:35:02,800 --> 04:35:03,560
Bye guys!

7814
04:35:03,880 --> 04:35:04,300
Bye!
