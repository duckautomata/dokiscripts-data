1
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,490
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,210
I am... I am a mess right now.

3
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,590
But when am I not a mess?

4
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,830
That's a good question.

5
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:08,670
I literally just installed Fortnite, like, my installation of Fortnite just stopped, like, finished, like, ten minutes ago.

6
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,290
Because I forgot I didn't install Fortnite on this PC.

7
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,230
Anyway, um, we have our Fortnite bodyguard, Doryu.

8
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,710
Um, he plays Fortnite a lot.

9
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:39,770
By the way, I need you guys to know, um, I had, I had, like, three other Fortnite pros that were supposed to play with me, but then they, like, I don't know, I think they found out I wasn't a Fortnite player and they dropped out.

10
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,800
So I'm glad, Doryu, you didn't drop out.

11
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,570
I didn't drop out.

12
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,810
Let me tell you a story.

13
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:02,990
So they asked me, the staff, Twitch staff asked me, um, asked me if, like, if I was willing to join the Fortnite Twitch Rivals.

14
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,050
And I was like, how sweaty is it?

15
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,810
And then they were like, oh, it's pretty sweaty.

16
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,870
And I was like, oh.

17
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:20,270
And I was like, uh, um, can you give me a Fortnite pro?

18
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,370
I can, I can do it, but, like, I think I need a Fortnite pro.

19
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,290
And they're like, don't worry, we got you.

20
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:36,210
Um, so then, so then three, I, we had three different people that we asked and, like, yeah.

21
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,250
Cause I was like, hey, um, I don't know about this.

22
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,830
Seems like this, I thought, you know, there'd be, like, people like me, you know, I thought there'd be, like, people like me.

23
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,390
And then I looked at the roster and then, cause, like, some, one of them suggested, the staff suggested me to recruit this player.

24
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,350
And I looked up this person's Twitter and they were, like, a fucking Fortnite professional.

25
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,070
And then they're, and they're recruiting for their Fortnite Twitch rivals.

26
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,310
They were, like, looking for a pro Fortnite pro player for Twitch rivals.

27
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,870
And I'm like, but he's already pro.

28
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,110
What, what do you mean?

29
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,270
Why is he looking for a Fortnite pro if he's already pro?

30
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,770
What do you mean?

31
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,790
I thought it'd be, like, you know, not pro with pro.

32
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,210
And this is what I would say.

33
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,950
I was like, hey, are there any other teams, like, like me?

34
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,330
And they're like, no, don't worry.

35
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,770
There's an Overwatch team as well.

36
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,450
There's, like, two Overwatch players together, um, in a team together.

37
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,370
Um, so they're just like you.

38
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,090
I'm like, okay.

39
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,450
But I looked at it and it's J3 and Apply.

40
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,430
Apply is in, you know, has been in Overwatch Cup.

41
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,910
J3 has been top 500 for, like, since Overwatch began.

42
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,450
So I was just like, oh.

43
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,450
I was just like, oh.

44
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,990
And then we, and then finally we got it.

45
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,590
We got an Overwatch pro.

46
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,430
Not Overwatch pro.

47
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,050
We got Fortnite.

48
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,170
We got, we got a Fortnite pro.

49
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,030
We got a Fortnite pro.

50
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,170
And literally, we met up.

51
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,250
We were like, hey, I'm not, I'm not a Fortnite player.

52
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:24,910
Is that okay?

53
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,810
And then the guy was like, oh, don't worry.

54
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,310
It's okay.

55
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,210
Don't worry.

56
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,870
We got this.

57
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,870
I was like, oh, thank God.

58
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,270
Okay.

59
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:37,310
Um, and then, like, literally, like, 15 minutes later, I got a message from the staff.

60
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,350
It was like, we need to find a new player.

61
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,050
And I was like, what happened?

62
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:51,190
And then the guy that was supposed to be my duo messaged me and was like, sorry, we had a family emergency.

63
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,550
I have to drop out.

64
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,970
I was like, we met for 15 minutes.

65
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,810
I was like, what?

66
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,850
We met for 15 minutes and then you got a family emergency?

67
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,550
What is my luck?

68
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,750
What is my luck?

69
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:22,890
And that was like an hour before, an hour before Twitch rivals, um, an hour before Twitch rivals start.

70
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,890
So luckily we managed to get, we managed to get Doryu, who plays a lot of Fortnite.

71
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,670
Um, and I was like, that's my new bodyguard.

72
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,810
I have a new bodyguard.

73
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,410
I finally have, I have another.

74
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,710
It took us a while, but we got another Fortnite bodyguard.

75
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,490
Um, so I hope I'll live long enough in this tournament.

76
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:56,590
I can't believe I, the 15 minute part was the most absurd.

77
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,330
Literally we were in a group chat with me and the Twitch staff and the other pro.

78
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,890
I was like, hey, I don't play Fortnite.

79
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,030
And then we were discussing drops too.

80
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,630
They're like, oh yeah, what kind of, what place do you want to land?

81
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,010
And I was like, oh, I don't know.

82
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,090
You can pick it.

83
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,090
You pretend, I know like I'm captain by name, but like you can, you can decide everything.

84
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,850
And then 15 minutes later, family emergency.

85
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,820
So my, my Fortnite bodyguard is an actual wolf.

86
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
Um, we can't lose this.

87
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,580
We literally have an actual werewolf.

88
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,660
So like, we can't lose this.

89
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,780
It's like that ZZZ game, right?

90
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,400
Where people were thirsting over that wolf boy.

91
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,220
Like, like I have a wolf boy too.

92
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,880
So like, we'll be fine.

93
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,840
It's just like that wolf boy.

94
00:07:51,900 --> 00:08:09,760
I have zero context of like what, what that guy is, but like, but like if that, if ZZZ can survive a wolf boy, maybe I can survive with also a wolf boy.

95
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,160
All right.

96
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,460
Okay.

97
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,900
I don't know where we're starting.

98
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,840
I'm going to unmute.

99
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,400
Hey, who are you?

100
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,240
Are we supposed to, do we have the code for the game yet?

101
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,180
Or like, no, not yet.

102
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm like watching it right now.

103
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,860
Everyone is, I think still like getting situated.

104
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,040
Oh, that's great.

105
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,500
Okay.

106
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,320
Yeah.

107
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,940
I'm watching the general chat right now.

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,200
Okay.

109
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,660
That's good.

110
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,340
Anyway, did you read the rules?

111
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,440
Cause there's a lot of rules.

112
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,500
And I, I read one paragraph and I was like, I, I already tuned it out.

113
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,100
So I assume your brain was just like naughty?

114
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,700
No, it's so long.

115
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,140
Like why is the rules so long?

116
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,720
I don't know.

117
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,280
Let me be your guide wolf and I will, I will be the slightly lesser smooth brain.

118
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:03,820
Cause I'm very smooth.

119
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah.

120
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,360
Yeah.

121
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,740
Like it's so long.

122
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,760
Okay.

123
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,100
That's for day two.

124
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,240
Oh, nevermind.

125
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,580
Day two is crazy, but day one is going to be bad.

126
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,100
We're not going to make it.

127
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,080
I was like, you have great confidence.

128
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,100
I'm like, no.

129
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,520
Okay.

130
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,600
You don't understand.

131
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,160
Like I did.

132
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:42,100
I told them the story of like how we ended up getting you, but basically I had three different Fortnite pros that dropped out.

133
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,560
Are you serious?

134
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,480
No fucking way.

135
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,120
And then the last Fortnite pro, the last four, like they were all Twitch aside too.

136
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,520
They were trying to like assign me a pro player.

137
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,900
Cause I was like, please, I need a Fortnite pro.

138
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,800
Like if you want me in this tournament, I'm not going to survive.

139
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,880
I feel your pain.

140
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:17,560
And then, um, and then like, and then so like, like Todd told them like the last Fortnite pro we like, I literally, we got in a group chat.

141
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,820
It was like an hour before the tournament before Twitch rivals.

142
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,860
And then we were like in a group chat, like we got them at like, um, 12 or something, 12 PM.

143
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,920
And then, and then like, and then we were like talking, I was like, Hey, I don't play Fortnite.

144
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,640
Is that okay?

145
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,020
And then he was like, yeah, that's fine.

146
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,520
It's cool.

147
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,220
And then, and then we're like, yeah, where do you want to travel?

148
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,000
It's like, I don't care.

149
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,460
I don't, I don't know what I'm doing.

150
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,960
Like, this is all on you, man.

151
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,440
And then 15 minutes later, he messaged me.

152
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,000
It's like, sorry, family emergency.

153
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,980
I can't do it.

154
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,850
Did their family emergency not be a family emergency?

155
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:08,210
Like literally right before the Like, wait, no, she's bad, bad.

156
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,150
Alright, got a phone in a family emergency.

157
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,130
Okay, do they even know that you used to play Apex?

158
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,610
Like, yeah, I said, I was like, Oh, I'm an Apex Overwatch player.

159
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,670
And then, but I honestly think it was, it could be, it could be a family emergency.

160
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,970
But like the timing, that was fucking crazy.

161
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,130
15 minutes after, like, I don't know, like realization struck for him.

162
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,910
And he's like, wait a minute.

163
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,830
I was fucking brushing my teeth, checking my phone.

164
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,570
I need somebody that knows how to play Fortnite.

165
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,770
You give me too much credit.

166
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,350
I know how to die very fast.

167
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,630
There's clips of you.

168
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,310
No, you're supposed to be my bodyguard.

169
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,430
You were like the last hope.

170
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,900
I don't remember this episode of Fortnite.

171
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,840
I, what is it called?

172
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,520
Like, is it literally like Dory, the last protector?

173
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,960
In reality, he's actually a big inting.

174
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,630
I'll eat the bullets.

175
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,670
No, you're not supposed to eat the bullets.

176
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,070
You're supposed to kill them.

177
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,330
Jogi, we're doomed.

178
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,050
We're doomed.

179
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,870
Oh, no, it's okay.

180
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,430
We're not going to make it to day two.

181
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,450
What if we make it to day two?

182
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,210
What if we're literally off on the board?

183
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,430
Then God actually hates us.

184
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,450
And God said, let there be VTubers and furry VTubers.

185
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,150
Oh my God.

186
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,110
You have sinned.

187
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,170
Oh my God.

188
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,570
I fucking, we're fucked.

189
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,930
Okay.

190
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,090
Jogi, we ready.

191
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,350
We fucking ready.

192
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,750
Oh my God.

193
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,990
Okay, they have the code.

194
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,970
We're supposed to be in a party together.

195
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,810
Yeah, here, let me invite you.

196
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,630
Let me invite you.

197
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,610
Also, are you Peter Griffin?

198
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,290
No, I'm John Cena now, so they can't see me.

199
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,770
I do have Peter Griffin, though.

200
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,210
Should I be Peter?

201
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,110
Wait, I could be Peter.

202
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,290
I could be whatever chat wants me to be.

203
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,970
Wait, what is chat going to make you?

204
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,970
Because then I can be something to match you.

205
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,430
Well, I have Meeseeks too.

206
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,610
Yeah, I have Meeseeks.

207
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,770
We could be Rick and Meeseeks.

208
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,270
Do you have Rick?

209
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,350
Uh, I don't have... Yeah, I have Rick.

210
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,170
Wait, you have Rick?

211
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,850
Oh my God!

212
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,410
Yeah, I'm being Rick.

213
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,370
Wait, wait, wait.

214
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,090
That's great.

215
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,710
Okay, wait.

216
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,770
How do I...

217
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,250
Okay, wait.

218
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,590
How do I go back to... Wait, am I not?

219
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:52,910
Oh, wait.

220
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,510
Am I not?

221
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,050
Join party.

222
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:54,450
Okay.

223
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,530
Oh my God.

224
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,350
You have Morty!

225
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,150
I have Morty!

226
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,350
Same character.

227
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,070
Same character.

228
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,730
Okay, okay.

229
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,850
Morty and Meeseeks.

230
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,230
Okay, they'll know who to kill first.

231
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,150
That's great.

232
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,650
They'll know who to get for easy points.

233
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,610
That's how we're going to send the message.

234
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,770
Um, I think I need to... Okay, let me enter the code real quick.

235
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,390
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,510
You do the code entering.

237
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,190
Ready.

238
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,270
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

239
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,750
Okay, I got it.

240
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,810
So, guys, how's Doryu?

241
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,170
Is Doryu's volume okay?

242
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,610
Yeah, same for you guys, chat.

243
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,690
Can you guys hear Doki fine?

244
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,350
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,770
Can you hear Doryu okay?

246
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,790
And can you hear me okay?

247
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,010
As long as I'm loud in Doryu, that's all that matters.

248
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,890
But also, you can't be like... You can't hear him.

249
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,950
My brain is still burning up.

250
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:47,090
I literally, like, got home, like, 30 minutes ago to install Fortnite.

251
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,750
Deadass.

252
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,650
Oh my God.

253
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,030
Doryu, we're so ready.

254
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,830
We are so fucking ready.

255
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:56,650
We're so ready.

256
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,490
We're so ready.

257
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,210
Okay, hit ready on that.

258
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,330
Okay, let me... I'm going to boost you up a little bit.

259
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,410
And then... Alright.

260
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,450
Okay, I boosted you up.

261
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,510
Chat, I got Morty on his back.

262
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,950
Or I got Rick on his back, okay?

263
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,650
Where's Rick?

264
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,590
Oh, you got Pickle Rick?

265
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,650
Wait, I think I have Pickle Rick, too.

266
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,290
Wait, actually, I don't know.

267
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,630
I buy a lot of stuff.

268
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,590
I have the snake... the pickaxe for the snake.

269
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,630
Oh, you got the snake pickaxe, too?

270
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,830
Yo, I'm going to hook that.

271
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,770
Yo, I'm fucking doing it.

272
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,590
I'm doing it.

273
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,650
Guys, you have to be, like, at a certain IQ to understand this.

274
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:32,990
Uh, let's see.

275
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,390
Wait, wait, wait.

276
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,270
Uh, what's it called?

277
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,130
It's called the snake?

278
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:35,590
Yeah.

279
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

280
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,510
I got it.

281
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,090
I got it.

282
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,730
Alright, we're so fucking back.

283
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,030
Funniest shit ever, guys.

284
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,750
Oh, you're fucking endless.

285
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,970
They ain't even ready.

286
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,910
Yeah, yeah.

287
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,210
They know we're a great team.

288
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,370
We're, like, matching.

289
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,650
We got the drip.

290
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,270
Exactly.

291
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,330
We got the drip.

292
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,510
Am I supposed to radio up?

293
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:55,790
Oops.

294
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,930
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and radio.

295
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,250
Alright, we're fine.

296
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,890
By the way, I was watching.

297
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,390
I was checking your stream out.

298
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,010
Because we went live earlier.

299
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,370
And you were doing game training.

300
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,510
I just want you to know, I was definitely not doing any of that.

301
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,570
Yo, but were you doing food training?

302
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,390
Because I'm...

303
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,390
Yeah, I was definitely not warming up.

304
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:24,970
The last time I shot the pew pew was at four in the morning two days ago.

305
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,690
Because I was ringing for an Apex scrim.

306
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,410
Yo, wait, you were doing Apex scrims?

307
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,910
No, it was for, like, somebody's... it was for a Japanese tournament.

308
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,910
So, like, I was ringing for somebody.

309
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,650
Oh my gosh.

310
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,950
Wait, who are you going to be playing?

311
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,310
Man, can you believe we haven't played Apex since, like, three years ago?

312
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,850
Yeah, I think that's like three or four years ago.

313
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,350
Three or four years ago when we did that Apex rank grind.

314
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,730
Yeah, we ancient.

315
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,590
Yeah, we're fucking old.

316
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,170
Yeah, you used to still be... you weren't a werewolf yet.

317
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,270
You used to be full fleshy.

318
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,010
I used to be a gross human flesh tuber.

319
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,490
Yeah, and then you got bit by a wolf.

320
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,270
Yeah, you guys don't get bit by a wolf.

321
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,850
And then you got that dog in you.

322
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,830
You was that 00... that ZZZ wolf before ZZZ came out.

323
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,270
Oh, husbando.

324
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,290
Oh, God.

325
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,330
Wait, you're like 30-something, right?

326
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,330
Yeah, I'm like... I'm ancient AFM.

327
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,710
Oh my God, you're old old.

328
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,390
Yeah, I'm like literally old old.

329
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:21,990
Oh my God.

330
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,870
I'm like Krusty Krusty.

331
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,150
I invented the Krusty Krab.

332
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:26,590
That's all about it.

333
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,650
Holy shit.

334
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,650
Oh my God.

335
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,010
Yo, how did you befriend a Krusty-ass Krusty Krab like me?

336
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,610
Apex?

337
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,570
I don't remember.

338
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,790
I think it was like a friend of a friend in Apex.

339
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,290
And then we just like played in rank.

340
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,230
Oh, I think it was like a rank.

341
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,930
Yeah, it was rank, yeah.

342
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,390
Yeah, we needed a plus one.

343
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,910
I don't know if it was you who needed a plus one or I needed a plus one.

344
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,350
But we were granting rank or something for Apex.

345
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,430
Wait, was that like LFG back then?

346
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,130
Was it LFG?

347
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,870
In Apex Discord?

348
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,010
I don't remember.

349
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,750
I feel like it might have been.

350
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,670
I feel like it might... Yeah, because like...

351
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,370
Otherwise, it would have been through... No, it had to be through a friend.

352
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,050
I think it was through a friend.

353
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,630
Because I remember one of us needed like a plus one for rank.

354
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,450
And then we were trying to get Pred or something.

355
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,010
And we were just LFG-ed.

356
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,990
We just like...

357
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,170
We were like, oh, I know some...

358
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,090
Like a mutual friend was like, we know somebody.

359
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,850
And it was like you or me.

360
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,290
God, like...

361
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,570
Wait, was it you that tweeted that clip from Apex days?

362
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,190
Yeah, yeah.

363
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,750
When we were like WKing?

364
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,610
When we was like me, you, and Sang.

365
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,230
And we like fucking killed like some fucking pro Pred team.

366
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,650
And they were like, what?

367
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,670
Because I didn't...

368
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,130
I stopped grinding rank at that time.

369
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,810
So I was Plat.

370
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,010
And then he was like, who the fuck is this Plat player?

371
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,090
DokiBread.

372
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,930
Who the fuck is she?

373
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,510
Or they don't even say, is he?

374
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,110
Who the fuck is he?

375
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,230
We were being so gremlin.

376
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,410
Yeah, because they were like, he's Plat.

377
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,350
What the fuck?

378
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,510
Yeah, look at this Plat Doki.

379
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,830
DokiBread looking ass.

380
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,970
Yeah, yeah, because we shit on them.

381
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,070
They were literally like top ten Pred or whatever.

382
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,430
Damn.

383
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,190
Oh my god.

384
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,610
I've not been playing Apex at all.

385
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,690
I'm still watching that game now.

386
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,130
Oh, it's alright.

387
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,850
Same here.

388
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,690
Doki, we in this.

389
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,550
We in this.

390
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,050
Wait, where are you?

391
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,270
I don't know.

392
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:14,910
I'm still connecting.

393
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,590
I'm still connecting.

394
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,170
Oh my god, it's us.

395
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,710
Look, it's us.

396
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,170
We had a pick a rank fight.

397
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,250
Wait, what emotes you got?

398
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:21,890
What emotes you got?

399
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,390
Wait, I don't remember.

400
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,170
What button is it?

401
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,010
What button is it?

402
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,250
I think I have B on mine.

403
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,510
Oh shit, we're like going...

404
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,710
Where's your drop spot?

405
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,010
We're going here.

406
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,230
We're going here.

407
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,430
So land on the blue mark.

408
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,150
Land on the blue mark.

409
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,350
That's yours.

410
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,670
Land on the blue mark.

411
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,530
Let me know when to drop.

412
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,710
That's all yours.

413
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,210
Do I drop?

414
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,690
Uh, drop...

415
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:35,990
Now.

416
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:36,430
Drop now.

417
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:36,670
Okay.

418
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,110
I'm gonna go here.

419
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,310
And I'm gonna get all the loot from that and I'll run over here.

420
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,550
Oh, so I land on the red, right?

421
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,730
Yeah, you land on the red.

422
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:42,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,590
Okay, okay, okay.

424
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,290
Guys, is Dory's volume better now or does he need to be lifted up more?

425
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,530
Yay!

426
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,270
Let's go!

427
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,710
Let's go!

428
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,710
I have no idea what the equipments are, so...

429
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,930
Oh, there's the plunger gun.

430
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,530
Literally run everything and anything you want to run.

431
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,610
Okay, cool.

432
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,590
And I will try to like...

433
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,450
And then you do everything else.

434
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,190
Basically, basically.

435
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,730
I'll just exist.

436
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,810
Yeah, yeah, I'll exist.

437
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:12,810
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,890
As long as I'm alive, then we've already accomplished a lot.

439
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,650
You have, um...

440
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,330
You know about shields and stuff, though, yeah?

441
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,370
Okay, okay, cool.

443
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,830
Yeah, I know.

444
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,670
I know about shields.

445
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,990
I have cosmetics, so at least I know that.

446
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,530
You know that cosmetics?

447
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:28,850
Whoa!

448
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,250
What did I do?

449
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,970
Oh, there's a little trampoline.

450
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,070
Alright, I got all my loot over here, so I'm gonna run with you.

451
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,410
Wait, I got a fucking trampoline thing.

452
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,730
Oh, those are really, really good.

453
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,250
I think I actually already used it.

454
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,530
The thing...

455
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,710
Oh, yeah, if you double jump, it like auto-deploys it, which is really annoying.

456
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,050
Yeah, because I was like, what the fuck?

457
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,290
How did that happen?

458
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,110
Wait, how do I...

459
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,950
Just watch in the house.

460
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,930
I'm gonna try to find us like...

461
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,350
So you know how in build mode, everyone turns into like a freaking tower or whatever?

462
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,410
By the way, I have...

464
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,690
I dropped a grappler if we want it.

465
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,570
Oh, you don't want that?

466
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,850
I don't think I can use it.

467
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,690
I don't think it's smart for me to use it.

468
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,790
Do you want to use shockwaves?

469
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,770
Do you know how to use shockwaves?

470
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,710
What's shockwaves?

471
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,150
It's the purple thing that basically like launches you into the air.

472
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,910
Oh, yeah, no.

473
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,930
Any movement stuff, do not rely on me for this game.

474
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,050
Look, my job is to exist.

475
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,490
What do I drop?

476
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,410
What do I drop, though?

477
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,790
Oh, wait, what guns are you using?

478
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,890
I have...

479
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,570
Okay, I'll drop... I have one gun.

480
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,310
Do you want a shotgun?

481
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,890
No, I'll take this gun.

482
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,950
This gun is tracking.

483
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,770
I can track.

484
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,330
Yo, okay, okay, okay.

485
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,610
So if you're gonna take tracking, I'm trying to think of what the other good weapons are.

486
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,010
Because the bloom is fucking booty in this game.

487
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,750
It's so annoying.

488
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,510
Oh, I don't know what any of those words are.

489
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,790
The RNG in the bullets is very, very bad.

490
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,110
Oh, okay, okay.

491
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,410
Oh, bloom, bloom, as in FPS.

492
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,590
Okay, I thought it was like a Fortnite word.

493
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,510
I thought you were using a Fortnite word on me.

494
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,790
No, Orlando Bloom is atrocious because he's gonna be in the co-op very soon.

495
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,150
Okay.

496
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,670
So zone is closing and... wait, what the hell?

497
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,830
We're right next to it.

498
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,990
We're next to the zone.

499
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:25,730
Oh, hey, there it is.

500
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,610
Oh, there's a chest there.

501
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,130
Yeah.

502
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:28,930
Oh, okay.

503
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,650
So you see these little bunkers right here on the ground?

504
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:31,830
Yeah, yeah.

505
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,070
Oh, I know the portal bunkers.

506
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,430
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,190
Yeah, yeah.

508
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,930
Grab those.

509
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,330
It's okay.

510
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,050
We're right next to the zone.

511
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:36,790
I'm gonna slash this guy.

512
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:38,930
Okay.

513
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,130
Yeah.

514
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,010
All right, let's go to the right?

515
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,630
All right, sure.

516
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,390
Let's go through here.

517
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,350
Come here, Meeseeks.

518
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:50,990
Oh, my God.

519
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,670
Wait, somebody's dead.

520
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,470
We're not last.

521
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,750
No, we're not last.

522
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,350
We're vibing.

523
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,750
We're fucking vibing right now.

524
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,670
Oh, we're not last.

525
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:57,830
Let's go.

526
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,830
We're actually vibing.

527
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,210
Let's fucking go.

528
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,050
We're doing so much already.

529
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,690
Yo, all we gotta do is exist, okay?

530
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,710
That's all we have to do.

531
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,250
We already got points for not being last.

532
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:09,790
Let's go.

533
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,050
Yeah, we're fucking chilling right now.

534
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,550
We should, like, change our skins every game just so they don't farm us.

535
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,510
I'm down.

536
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,850
Oh, there's a team here.

537
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,890
I'm gonna go back real quick.

538
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:19,850
Let's go around.

539
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,670
Let's try to be evasive.

540
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,110
Okay.

541
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,130
Let's go, like, over here.

542
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:22,970
Yeah.

543
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,810
It was a condom skin.

544
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,210
You know the gray superhero ones?

545
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,330
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

546
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,270
Hold on.

547
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,510
They're gonna be to the right.

548
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,810
Oh, yeah, they see us.

549
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,090
Oh, they do.

550
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,410
They do.

551
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,170
Oh, they're jumping up.

552
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,470
Let's go over here.

553
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,570
Yeah, no, I feel like they have matching skins, too.

554
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,650
So, they could be really, really good matching skins or really, really bad matching skins like us.

555
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,230
They might be just as scared as us.

556
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,030
That's true.

557
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:48,490
Oh, my God.

558
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,370
I keep watching back.

559
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,930
They're gonna be probably mirroring us over here.

560
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,110
Oh, there's a team over here.

561
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:52,570
All right.

562
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,430
Let's go under the bridge.

563
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:53,990
Let's go under the bridge.

564
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,210
Okay.

565
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,230
Let's go here.

566
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,450
All right.

567
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,990
I'm heading down with you.

568
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,510
I'm looking for you.

569
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,410
Oh, we're chilling here.

570
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:02,790
We're chilling.

571
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,070
We're chilling.

572
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,250
All right.

573
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,130
Nice, nice, nice.

574
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,890
Okay, I'm gonna just kind of crouch here.

575
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,650
We can just, we can vibrate here.

576
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,490
Oh, I hear them shooting.

577
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,870
They're shooting already.

578
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,850
Not last.

579
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,610
Yeah, we're chilling.

580
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,290
Look at me, number one.

581
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,750
Level 146.

582
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,030
You said you didn't play.

583
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,570
I don't play this game.

584
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,050
What do you mean?

585
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,670
Level 146.

586
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm literally level one.

587
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,170
Yeah, that's scrub levels, right?

588
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:25,870
That's scrub.

589
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,210
What am I?

590
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,410
What am I?

591
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,730
You're Mr. Meeseeks.

592
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,590
You got a little...

593
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,130
I'm level one.

594
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,770
What am I, then?

595
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:35,650
You're...

596
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,070
I don't know.

597
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,570
You're level...

598
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,450
Can they hear that?

599
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,130
They definitely can't hear me.

600
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,550
What the fuck?

601
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,850
Now they know we're down here.

602
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,350
No, we're chilling.

603
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,210
I think I'd be super close to it, so know that we're here.

604
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,890
They apparently said I don't have the visual feedback.

605
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,630
Oh, you don't?

606
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,110
Okay, hold on.

607
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,610
I got an idea.

608
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:54,990
I got an idea.

609
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:55,730
Hit escape.

610
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,670
Oh, no, actually, don't do it.

611
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,970
There's people above us.

612
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,230
I was gonna say.

614
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,230
I didn't...

615
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,450
I don't know.

616
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,590
You're gonna be right here?

617
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,410
I didn't turn that off.

618
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,590
Okay, I'll watch for us.

619
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,230
I'm watching for us.

620
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,990
Okay.

621
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,730
Oh, this thing got cracked above us?

622
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,890
We might be able to get them if they, like...

623
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:14,390
Dropped out?

624
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,070
Yep, 38.

625
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,230
Wait, what?

626
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,010
They are right above us.

627
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,550
We're gonna put pressure on them if they try to, like...

628
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,210
Don't look down.

629
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,050
Don't look down.

630
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,470
Don't look down.

631
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,910
We're gonna have to move, so...

632
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,030
Oh, fuck, I have a crown!

633
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,870
I'm so dumb.

634
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,930
Wait, you have a crown?

635
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:32,810
What's that?

636
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,890
Yeah, I did not want this crown.

637
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,850
Oh, it means I won the last game.

638
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,310
Oh, we didn't turn that off!

639
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,250
That's so unfair!

640
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,170
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

641
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,930
Doki, Doki, come here.

642
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,610
Come, come, come, come.

643
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,010
Look at this, look at this, look at this.

644
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,230
We can choose guys in the back.

645
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,710
3, 2, 1.

646
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,190
The one on the left.

647
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,450
Oh, no, never mind.

648
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:47,770
Okay.

649
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,430
Okay, okay.

650
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,070
Okay, well, we're gonna go to the left then.

651
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,710
Alright, goodbye.

652
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:53,850
Goodbye.

653
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,460
Oh, yep, I'm gonna do this.

654
00:25:59,480 --> 00:25:59,740
Okay.

655
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,220
I'm gonna do this again.

656
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,680
And I'm gonna splash us.

657
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,560
Nice.

658
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,060
Oh my god, that was a quick reaction.

659
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,900
You want my portal bunker?

660
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,580
Uh, carry.

661
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,920
You sure you don't want to carry it?

662
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,140
No, I'm pretty sure.

663
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:13,980
Okay.

664
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,440
Okay.

665
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,260
Okay, so follow me here.

666
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,940
Follow me, follow me.

667
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
We're gonna crouch.

668
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,000
We're gonna go to the side.

669
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,480
Am I crouching?

670
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:25,760
No.

671
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,380
There you go, there you go.

673
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,380
Okay, get ready.

674
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,180
And we're gonna run in 3, 2, 1.

675
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,640
Let's start going.

676
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,280
Okay.

677
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,280
We're gonna see this team in a sec.

678
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,060
Oh, they're right in front.

679
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,220
I'm gonna get on here.

680
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,300
We're gonna show on the left.

681
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,560
Uh, okay.

682
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,180
Doki, we're gonna have to go over here.

683
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,980
So, stand right on me.

684
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,540
Stand right on me.

685
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:50,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

686
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,220
Oh, we're gonna show on the back.

687
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:52,940
What the fuck?

688
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,300
What are they doing here?

689
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,340
I got us, I got us, I got us.

690
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,660
Okay.

691
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,400
Uh, okay.

692
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,280
So, do you know how to shockwave yourself?

693
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,560
We'll find out.

694
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,840
Take that thing and use it like a pathfinder.

695
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,260
Okay.

696
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,120
Alright.

697
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,800
Like this?

698
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,840
Oh, shit!

699
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,780
Oh, did I knock you?

700
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:13,860
No!

701
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:14,980
No!

702
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,360
Hey, we got 16!

703
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,640
I think you shocked me into the other team.

704
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,500
No, it doesn't look kind of good.

705
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,080
Oh, fuck.

706
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,820
Do you think you shocked me?

707
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,420
No, no, no, that was all part of the plan.

708
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,660
It was gonna be an evasive shockwave and then we're gonna go...

709
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,300
That was part of the plan.

710
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,680
What was the plan?

711
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,800
What was the plan?

712
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,920
Oh, they have the apex thing now.

713
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,520
They have that thing.

714
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,780
Wait, you had the grapple.

715
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,380
Oh, I had the plunger grapple.

716
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,660
I could have used that.

717
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,520
They're using my...

718
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:07,740
Yeah, plunge.

719
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,240
They're using my plunge.

720
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,160
Oh, that's where you died.

721
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,540
Yeah, that's where I died at.

722
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:11,840
Yeah.

723
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,220
See these skins?

724
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,480
These are what we call the condom skins.

725
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,440
Oh, wait.

726
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,660
So, you do play Fortnite.

727
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,760
You know all the lingo.

728
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,000
You know the lingo.

729
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,360
Yeah, Chad.

730
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,600
Do you guys know about the condom skins?

731
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,660
Wait, okay.

732
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,360
So, how do I turn on the audio feedback?

733
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,660
So, under settings, go to...

734
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,040
Oh, is it the very last one?

735
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,320
Oh, no, no.

736
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,040
I think it's under...

737
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,680
Oh, where is it?

738
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,780
I gotta find it again.

739
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,260
Is it visual sound effects?

740
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,640
Yeah, yeah.

741
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:43,920
It's that one.

742
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,580
Just turn that on.

743
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:45,920
Yeah, yeah.

744
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,520
All right, all right.

745
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,280
We're good.

746
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,380
We're good to go.

747
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,280
Guys.

748
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,480
Yo, we weren't dead last.

749
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,200
We were not dead last.

750
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah, we're not last.

751
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,040
How many teams are in it?

752
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,220
Per game?

753
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,220
I think it's 40 teams.

754
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:56,760
I think.

755
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,260
What?

756
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,300
We did it all the way?

757
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,360
20 teams.

758
00:28:59,560 --> 00:28:59,940
Oh, okay.

759
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

760
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,760
You should have lied and said 40, so I felt happier.

761
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,720
I think if I remember right now...

762
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,320
Let me look at the team numbers.

763
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah, out of 20 teams, we were...

764
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think...

765
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,380
Twelve?

766
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,120
No, we were 16.

767
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,000
We played 16.

768
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,140
We were 16?

769
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,020
Oh, you're right.

770
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:22,900
Yeah, we were 16.

771
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm like, there's numbers at the top.

772
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,640
There's literally a number right there at the top.

773
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,300
There's literally a number at the top.

774
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,260
I was like, where did you get the 12 from?

775
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,220
I'm like over here looking at Discord.

776
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,860
Like, hold on.

777
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,320
Let me put on my nerd glasses real quick.

778
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,640
Yeah, yeah.

779
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,200
I got them.

780
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,760
All right.

781
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,520
Let me...

782
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:39,800
Okay.

783
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,180
My audio guy said, turn you down just a little bit.

784
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,840
And then boost up the audio.

785
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,940
So give me a sec.

786
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,620
I'm going to turn you down just a little bit.

787
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,060
And then...

788
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,660
All right, guys.

789
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,320
Does the game sound a lot better, chat?

790
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,160
Does the game sound a lot better?

791
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,400
Yeah, how does Doki sound to you guys?

792
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,400
Is Doki pretty okay?

793
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,230
Thank you, Sombob.

794
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,620
Thank you.

795
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,320
All right.

796
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,580
I just got to make sure.

797
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,200
All right, guys.

798
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,660
That was our warm-up game.

799
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,540
Yeah, that was a warm-up.

800
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,340
That was literally the warm-up game.

801
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,920
That was a warm-up, chat.

802
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I had literally no idea what I'm doing.

803
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,260
I still don't, but like now...

804
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,780
At least, like, I know a little bit more.

805
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,660
That's all that matters.

806
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,380
What the fuck?

807
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,440
They said no build.

808
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,640
Put all these port-a-bunkers.

809
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,020
Yo, fucking...

810
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,720
This is what I tell chat all the time.

811
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,660
I'm like, yo, I love Zero Hell.

812
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,060
How is it no build if there's bunkers?

813
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,600
Thank you.

814
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,900
That's counterintuitive to no building.

815
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,500
Because we're still building our bunker.

816
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,100
I literally complain about this all the time.

817
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,240
I'm like, I love Zero Hell.

818
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,920
Zero build, wait.

819
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,340
I love...

820
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,420
Oh my god, that's how you do...

821
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,940
Oh my god, that's how you do the jump.

822
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,040
Oh, it doesn't matter.

823
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,240
She's still dead.

824
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,840
Yeah, you like...

825
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,660
You throw...

826
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,520
You basically throw...

827
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,180
It's like a grenade.

828
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,240
You like throw it at your feet.

829
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,900
And then it'll launch you wherever direction that your character is standing on.

830
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,280
Oh.

831
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,040
I see.

832
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,660
But the nice thing about this mode is that it responds...

833
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,140
Did you ever play Three Strikes?

834
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

835
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,540
It's like Three Strikes.

836
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,220
It's like Three Strikes in Fortnite.

837
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:14,940
Yeah.

838
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,660
So, as long as one person's still alive, we're chilling.

839
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,840
These guys are such nerds.

840
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,920
They're doing, like, same skin.

841
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:21,860
They're not...

842
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,520
I know, right?

843
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,480
You could do, like, matching themed skin.

844
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,320
That's like...

845
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,660
You know how, like, um...

846
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,060
Like...

847
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,540
Like...

848
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,220
Beta...

849
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,760
Betas use same skin.

850
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,020
Alpha and Sigma males use matching themed.

851
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,520
Yeah, I don't see any, like...

852
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,560
There is no chat right now.

853
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,060
Everyone's using a condom.

854
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,100
Same skin is boring.

855
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,760
It's all about the theme.

856
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's the theming of the skin.

857
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,340
Wait, do you have Dragon Ball skins?

858
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

859
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,560
I have all the good ones.

860
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,720
Which one do you want?

861
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,340
Do you have all of them as well?

862
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,520
I think I do, yeah.

863
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,640
I'm pretty sure I have all the...

864
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,020
Well, all the first wave.

865
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,560
Because I think they did a second wave of, like, Dragon Ball skins.

866
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,260
I have, like...

867
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,420
I have Frieza and Cell and Vegeta.

868
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,320
What?

869
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,260
Do you have Frieza and Cell?

870
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:03,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

871
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,920
I have Goku too, I think.

872
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,300
Oh, so jelly.

873
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,380
Okay, I don't have Frieza.

874
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,040
But I do have Goku and, like, Vegeta.

875
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:09,920
Oh, okay.

876
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,240
Wait, we could do Goku, Vegeta.

877
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,720
I got Team Big Forehead.

878
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,600
Oh, my God.

879
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:14,820
Okay.

880
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,940
Do we want to do the...

881
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,860
Or we do villains.

882
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,180
Do we want to do villain hero or just the heroes?

883
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,660
I'm down.

884
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,680
I'm down for villains.

885
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,260
Villain hero?

886
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:24,720
Okay.

887
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,420
I can do Frieza and you can be Goku.

888
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,660
All right.

889
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,840
The teamwork of the century.

890
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,460
The collab of the century.

891
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,860
Frieza and Goku working together in Fortnite to beat the Fortnite players.

892
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,520
Kakarot.

893
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,360
I must beat Fortnite players.

894
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,080
I can't believe it.

895
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
The team up.

896
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,160
They teamed up together so they can beat Fortnite.

897
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,920
I never foresaw this happening.

898
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,780
If you ever asked me in the past.

899
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:51,880
I can't believe it.

900
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,120
The ending we all wanted.

901
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,240
The tournament of power loss episode.

902
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,560
Let's go.

903
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:13,320
I am so happy that out of all the teams that are playing in this tourney, no one is ready for Team Kakarot and Vegeta.

904
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,180
No, we're Frieza.

905
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,100
Frieza, I mean.

906
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,680
Yeah, Frieza.

907
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,340
How could you?

908
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,040
Fake fan.

909
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,780
Fake fan.

910
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,640
No.

911
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,000
Not like this.

912
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,180
You're a fake fan.

913
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,180
You try to pretend you're a real fan by using Kakarot, but you're a fake fan.

914
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,040
You mistaken Frieza with Vegeta.

915
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,920
I'm more of a Naruto fan.

916
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,080
I can't believe it.

917
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,480
I have not watched Dragon Ball since, I think, Z?

918
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,600
What was after Z?

919
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,740
They did GT on Cartoon Network.

920
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,060
GT, which is not canon.

921
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,740
Yeah, which is not canon and doesn't exist in Dragon Ball eyes.

922
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,940
I know one person that is sinned by GT being amazing and otherwise everyone has sinned against it.

923
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,120
Wait, you think GT is amazing?

924
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,400
Me?

925
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,260
No, no.

926
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:05,800
I do not think so.

927
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,480
Okay, okay.

928
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,520
I was going to say, then we know you're an actual fake fan.

929
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:22,800
I remember when, you know, in Dragon Ball, they Dragon Balled and then they, like, did the Z thing and then they know when Naruto...

930
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,260
What is the Z thing in your world?

931
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,260
Holy shit, this guy's a Fortnite player.

932
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,480
Oh, you want to know what Z means?

933
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,260
You want to know how I got the fucking Z?

934
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,780
Yeah.

935
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,900
It's literally because someone took Doryu on Twitch.

936
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,620
Oh, so then you're like, Doryu Z.

937
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,160
Yeah, so like, everyone who's like, yo, what's the cool lore to your name?

938
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,180
I'm like, I couldn't take my original name.

939
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,700
That's my lore.

940
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,180
Fake Dragon Ball fan over here.

941
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,240
I was like, his name is Naruto, Goku is his dad.

942
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,180
And you know when Bulma, like, did the Bulma thing and then...

943
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:20,480
Yeah, you know when Bulma and Sakura, like, worked together to rescue Boruto and then after that, that, like, Bleached Man came over and...

944
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,540
Yeah.

945
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,260
I can't believe...

946
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,220
Sasuke Kurosaki, right?

947
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,740
Yeah, yeah.

948
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:33,320
And then, like, Sasuke came over with Luffy D-something to help him find the One Piece.

949
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,520
That's it, right?

950
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,300
You know, I was hurting my brain by trying to formulate all these thoughts.

951
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,040
But, like, we're hurting our brain collectively as a team right now.

952
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,100
Wait, Bleached Man's name isn't Bleach?

953
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,760
He has an actual name?

954
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,860
Yeah, you know, his name is Man Bleach or John Bleach.

955
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,300
Oh, it's John Bleach Man, right?

956
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,240
John Bleach Man, yeah.

957
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,120
Yeah, when he carries that big-ass gun, you know?

958
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

959
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,980
From that one Final Fantasy game.

960
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,680
And he's out there to find the Dragon Balls.

961
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,980
Yeah, and then he throws the Dragon Balls and then he summons Ifrit, right?

962
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,520
Yeah, yeah, and then he summons Vegeta.

963
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,280
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

964
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,260
Oh, that was such a good episode.

965
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,340
That's, like, the big-ass monkey.

966
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,740
Vegeta, the monkey.

967
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,320
Oh, you mean that Tarzan?

968
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,140
Tarzan?

969
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,020
Yeah.

970
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,060
Wait, they made Japanese Tarzan?

971
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,080
You know, they probably did.

972
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,460
There's just a fanfic of, like, anime Tarzan.

973
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,380
And then they saved the world!

974
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,400
I guarantee someone is searching it right now on, like, DeviantArt.

975
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,780
If DeviantArt even still is alive.

976
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,160
So I lost all my fans by butchering five different big fandoms in anime.

977
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,460
Five of the biggest anime fandoms ever.

978
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,980
But we didn't slander Evangelion yet, though.

979
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,100
Evangelion?

980
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,920
Which I literally just watched it for the first time.

981
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,280
Did you realize, like, the company went bankrupt recently?

982
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,360
Wait, what?

983
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,660
Yeah, for, like, money laundering or something.

984
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Are you talking about Studio Trigger or the studio behind it?

985
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,460
The original studio behind it.

986
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,000
They, like, Jesus Christ, what the fuck am I watching?

987
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,720
Why is there a fucking easter egg head?

988
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,300
There's an easter egg head.

989
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,460
That's what it was, Genix.

990
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,300
Yeah, yeah.

992
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,420
Genix died years ago, but they officially died recently.

993
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,780
Like, as in, like, I think, like, there was a news article saying they just, like, recently got, like, a sentence or whatever.

994
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:37,740
What?

995
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,240
Like, the directors for, like, behind, the CEO behind Genix.

996
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,020
Oh my god, the condom man won!

997
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:43,780
Yo, what?

998
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,240
A condom man?

999
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,120
There's several condom men?

1000
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,160
Yo.

1001
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,900
There's several condom men.

1002
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,800
So fucking sweaty.

1003
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,840
I feel like, when the condom skins get put on, you know that, like, clown image of the guy in the mirror?

1004
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,240
Yeah.

1005
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,100
Like, putting the makeup on?

1006
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1007
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,940
It's like the condom skins, like, it's time.

1008
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,620
Why do you think they're so cool?

1009
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,160
Other games don't think you're cool with the condom man skin.

1010
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,920
They think you're fucking nerds.

1011
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,780
You're basically the bald wraith of Apex.

1012
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,440
That's not a compliment.

1013
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,840
I have always called him the bald wraith of Apex.

1014
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,540
I fucking love you.

1015
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,620
Yeah, you can be exact.

1016
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,080
It's almost like, you can literally be Goku.

1017
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,880
Why would you be a condom?

1018
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,580
Exactly!

1019
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,440
That's what I'm saying.

1020
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,060
How do we back out?

1021
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,780
Return to lobby?

1022
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,560
Yeah, I think we back out.

1023
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,280
Yeah, return to lobby.

1024
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,540
Alright, I'm gonna be...

1025
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,720
You can literally be...

1026
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,780
You can be Eddie!

1027
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,480
You can be the fucking people in Lethal Company!

1028
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,640
They literally added Lethal Company in Fortnite and you decided to be a condom?

1029
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,140
No, I wanna be a condom.

1030
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,980
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1031
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,540
Anyway, I'm gonna be Frieza.

1032
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,840
Alright, so I'm being Vegeta, right?

1033
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,760
Yeah, yeah.

1034
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,620
No, no, Goku.

1035
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,160
Oh, I'm gonna be Goku, okay.

1036
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,440
Alright, I'm gonna see what's in the shop.

1037
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,680
What the fuck is this?

1038
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,960
The signature style?

1039
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,800
Do you see that?

1040
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,280
The Mad Mochi outfit?

1041
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,500
Oh, is it the big, like, the thing that looks like they're from Super Mario?

1042
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,240
What?

1043
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, like the build-up.

1044
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,040
A tall, like, mochi ball man.

1045
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,460
Yeah!

1046
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,940
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

1047
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,800
You can literally be a Mad Mochi person.

1048
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,010
Oh my god, I thought you had the blue...

1049
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:42,130
Guys, by the way, if you wanna support a creator, you can use that Doki Bird right here.

1050
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,220
So, um, when you buy stuff...

1051
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,890
Yeah, use code Doki Bird.

1052
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,550
No, chat, use code Doki.

1053
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:51,890
Yeah, yeah, Doki Bird.

1054
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,190
Doki Bird, Doki Bird.

1055
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1056
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,230
Oh my god, it's the weekend.

1057
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,330
Lady Gaga's in here?

1058
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,710
Yeah, they have Lady Gaga, they have Ariana Grande.

1059
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,970
Oh my god, I was so behind.

1060
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:09,330
The only thing I remember from it was the Lethal Company men in there.

1061
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,510
Doki, the night is young.

1062
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,530
We can literally play so many combos.

1063
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:16,690
Oh my god, there's, like, oh, they added more Marvel characters.

1064
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,750
Yeah, we could literally be Thanos and, like, Black Widow.

1065
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,570
Or we could be...

1066
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,590
Oh my god.

1067
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:27,610
I can't believe Pius the Caribbean is in here.

1068
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:28,510
Right?

1069
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,050
What the fuck?

1070
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:35,510
They're doing a big update on Friday, where they're gonna add a bunch of, like, Pirates of the Caribbean stuff.

1071
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,050
Oh!

1072
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,810
And they're adding in this, like, pirate ship movement item, where, like, you basically, like...

1073
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,070
What?

1074
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,050
Yeah, I think you, like, summon a ghost pirate ship.

1075
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,310
You guys summon a ghost pirate ship?

1076
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,490
What the fuck?

1077
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,650
Yeah, yeah.

1078
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,470
Isn't that broken?

1079
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,910
Does that seem...

1080
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,730
Oh, that's why Fortnite competitive is dead.

1081
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,550
Don't say a lot of them in the back.

1082
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,270
Now I understand.

1083
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:08,650
How the fuck do you balance a giant pirate ship?

1084
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,590
Like, how the fuck?

1085
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,810
Okay, I think I got all the right stuff equipped right now.

1086
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,150
Okay.

1087
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,230
Oh, okay.

1088
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,250
Let me see what I can equip, too.

1089
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,450
I got Frieza.

1090
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,190
What are you doing in the back?

1091
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:25,910
For the back?

1092
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,290
Oh, for the back?

1093
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:27,750
Yeah, yeah.

1094
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,430
I have the oxygen tank.

1095
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,690
Oh, you have the oxygen tank?

1096
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,010
Okay.

1097
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:31,990
Do you have a crewmate?

1098
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,750
Like the little Amogus?

1099
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,810
No, I didn't buy it.

1100
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,370
Yeah, I think they have that for when they start selling the game on Epic.

1101
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,310
No, I don't have it.

1102
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:44,990
I have...

1103
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,290
Let's see.

1104
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,130
I have...

1105
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,650
I'll put it on baby bender.

1106
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,450
You're going to put baby bender?

1107
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,170
Oh, baby bender.

1108
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:51,990
I have that, too.

1109
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,370
I'm going to put baby bender.

1110
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,790
And then my pickaxe is still going to be...

1111
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,630
I'm going to keep my pickaxe the same because I don't think we're going to be using that much often.

1112
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:00,630
Yeah.

1113
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,910
Should I put on Yoda?

1114
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,050
I can put Yoda on my back.

1115
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,730
Oh, is he a baby Yoda?

1116
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:05,470
Yeah.

1117
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:05,790
Oh, my God.

1118
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:06,370
Baby bender.

1119
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,390
It's grown-ass.

1120
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,290
Oh, sorry.

1121
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,110
Sorry.

1122
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,750
Grown-ass Yoda.

1123
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:11,830
Oh, wait.

1124
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:12,850
What the fuck?

1125
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,550
Wait, how do I turn yourself back so I can see it?

1126
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:17,750
Oh, wait.

1127
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,430
I can do an emote.

1128
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,250
Let me do an emote real quick.

1129
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:19,630
Okay, okay.

1130
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,910
I want to see baby Yoda.

1131
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,250
Or, like, grown-ass Yoda.

1132
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,470
I think he'll jump on the back.

1133
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:28,570
No, okay.

1134
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:28,830
Never mind.

1135
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,210
He does not jump on the back.

1136
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:30,990
Wait, what about...

1137
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,150
Uh...

1138
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,570
This one?

1139
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,610
I can barely...

1140
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,270
I, like, sort of see it.

1141
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,990
I gotta find one where I just turn around.

1142
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,350
Where's the turn-around one, Chat?

1143
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,090
Oh, wait.

1144
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,870
Did we get the next code?

1145
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,670
Oh, okay.

1146
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,270
We got the next code?

1147
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,090
We did.

1148
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,710
We got the next code.

1149
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:53,990
Okay.

1150
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:56,770
Uh...

1151
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:57,930
Let me enter the...

1152
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,630
We'll never see big, grown-ass Yoda.

1153
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,610
Alright, let me...

1154
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,410
Okay, I got it.

1155
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,370
Okay, go ahead and ready up.

1156
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:08,810
Alright.

1157
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,350
What else do I have?

1158
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,850
I have...

1159
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,550
I have...

1160
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,130
The Macarena.

1161
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:16,750
What do you have?

1162
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,110
Oh, yeah!

1163
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,570
Wait, I have that, too!

1164
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:20,550
Let's go!

1165
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,210
No, you got a one.

1166
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,210
Let's fucking go!

1167
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,870
Let's fucking go!

1168
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,390
Bring back this era!

1169
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,830
Oh, my God!

1170
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,510
The moment I saw that in the store, I needed to have it.

1171
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,230
Have you actually watched that video again recently?

1172
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:35,870
Yeah.

1173
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,930
Did you watch the video where they all got together and recreated?

1174
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:40,690
They got together again?

1175
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,050
Yeah, they got together and recreated!

1176
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,490
And you can see that it's not the same because they went corporate.

1177
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,370
Some of them became businessmen and women.

1178
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:53,430
And you can see that it's not as good as before.

1179
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:54,870
Dang!

1180
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,590
Life hit them hard.

1181
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,250
Corporate hit them hard.

1182
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,550
Let me see if I can find it.

1183
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,090
Oh, my God.

1184
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:01,530
Wait, okay.

1185
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,050
What was it called?

1186
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,370
Was it a goth dance?

1187
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,310
It's called Infectious.

1188
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,550
Oh, it's a cyber goth dance party.

1189
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:09,830
Okay.

1190
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,110
Cyber goth.

1191
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,070
They just went...

1192
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,190
Oh, it's called the video, right?

1193
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,690
Cyber goth dance reunion.

1194
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,450
And you can tell it's not the same.

1195
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,910
My boyfriend and I were talking about it the other day.

1196
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,450
And we were like, dang.

1197
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,710
You know, everyone used to make fun of them back then.

1198
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,410
And then the comment section changed to everyone vibing with them.

1199
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,290
Everybody was just like, God, I wish I could feel the joy they felt back then.

1200
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:33,930
Right.

1201
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,930
Their soul.

1202
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,470
And then the moment they went and became adults, their soul was gone.

1203
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,910
Hey, would you type in cyber goth party?

1204
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,450
Cyber goth dance.

1205
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,110
Cyber goth dance reunion?

1206
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,230
I don't know.

1207
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:51,830
I don't remember.

1208
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,750
I saw like a video of it, but I don't know.

1209
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,890
I don't know where I found it.

1210
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,830
What was the cyber goth dance reunion?

1211
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,790
I like how there's like a video pops up called goth rave at a funeral.

1212
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,950
Oh, there it is.

1213
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:09,670
There it is.

1214
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,250
I found it.

1215
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:10,810
I found it.

1216
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:11,830
I'm going to link it.

1217
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:12,790
Send it.

1218
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:13,090
Send it.

1219
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,950
I'm going to link it in my chat first.

1220
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:15,990
And then I'll send it over.

1221
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,950
All right.

1222
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,570
I need to make sure I can send it.

1223
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,570
Guys, it's not the same.

1224
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,170
You can tell.

1225
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,270
You can tell.

1226
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,170
One of them is literally wearing a suit.

1227
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,210
You can tell.

1228
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:29,750
It's not.

1229
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,330
It's not the same.

1230
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,250
Why is this like a 10 year reunion?

1231
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,030
Oh, my God.

1232
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,390
It's like 12 years later.

1233
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,250
That's crazy.

1234
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:44,330
This guy, one of them just came back from work and he's like, all right, don't worry.

1235
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,610
I'll be here.

1236
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,940
There's some very interesting results.

1237
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,800
I love seeing all these different things I'm like going through right now.

1238
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,380
That was 10 years ago.

1239
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,100
12 years ago.

1240
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,240
You can see it.

1241
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,380
It's not the same.

1242
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,940
It was before they got real jobs.

1243
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,100
Before they became adults.

1244
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,120
I never saw this ending.

1245
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,220
That guy in the fishnet shirt, though.

1246
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:13,920
Holy shit.

1247
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,920
I'll pull up your stream.

1248
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,280
I gotta see it on your side.

1249
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,900
No, I'm not even looking at it.

1250
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,640
I'm not looking at the stream.

1251
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,440
This is on my other tab.

1252
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,120
They changed that.

1253
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,980
Reality hit them hard.

1254
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,220
And they became businessmen.

1255
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,880
They had to earn money.

1256
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,920
They had to make money.

1257
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,840
And pay taxes.

1258
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,720
Wait, this is them?

1259
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah, that's them.

1260
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,520
It's the reunion.

1261
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,630
They were sore for days after that.

1262
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,070
This is what's going to give us power for the next game.

1263
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,030
Exactly, right here.

1264
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:00,750
We're gonna...

1265
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,170
We're gonna bring back CyberGoth.

1266
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:05,410
What?

1267
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,350
I gotta pause it.

1268
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,450
Dang, look at her.

1269
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:09,890
What?

1270
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,430
Oh my God.

1271
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,370
The main one at the front is the guy who was at the front of the other video.

1272
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,110
I think they're all placed in the same spot, right?

1273
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:18,570
Yeah.

1274
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:19,950
What?

1275
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,590
That's so crazy.

1276
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,710
We're bringing it back.

1277
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,010
We gotta sync it up.

1278
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,630
A buddy in my chat said they're...

1279
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,670
They're basically Fortnite skins.

1280
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,410
They're basically Fortnite skins.

1281
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,150
Wait, we gotta sync the dance.

1282
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,530
You guys ready to emote together?

1283
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,950
Yo, yo, wait, we sync it?

1284
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:40,990
Yeah, three...

1285
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,590
Wait, okay, wait.

1286
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:42,030
Okay.

1287
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,270
Let me...

1288
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,850
Wait, I have it on.

1289
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,830
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1290
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,070
I just defeated them!

1291
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,870
Okay, we got this, we got this.

1292
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,350
Okay, you count down, you count down.

1293
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:58,530
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1294
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,350
No, we're so close!

1295
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:02,750
We're so close!

1296
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:10,790
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1297
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,630
Yes!

1298
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,850
No!

1299
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,530
Let's fucking go!

1300
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:19,490
Oh my god, we look so good!

1301
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,110
Wait, mine even synced on my end.

1302
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,230
Wait, you synced on my end?

1303
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:28,510
As long as it synced on someone's side, that's all that matters.

1304
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:31,030
It's like, to the frame, it's actually, like, perfect.

1305
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:35,070
We're gonna bring back Cybergod!

1306
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,290
Yeah, this is the revival here.

1307
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:38,250
This is the revival.

1308
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,570
The revival is coming.

1309
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:40,610
It's happening.

1310
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,010
Pretty perfect.

1311
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:45,850
I think it's great that we used Dragon Ball Z skins for Cybergod.

1312
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,850
I also just love that you're running like Baby Bender on your back.

1313
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,670
You have Adult Yoda and I have Baby Bender.

1314
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,330
Wait, what other ones do you have?

1315
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:56,970
Let me see if I have, like...

1316
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:57,390
What's this one?

1317
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,090
I wish you had, like, Baby Yoda.

1318
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,390
Oh my god, why does he look like that?

1319
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,750
Yoda looks so fucking off.

1320
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:05,690
I know, right?

1321
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,750
He looks like a Kyrian old man.

1322
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,510
He's literally Star Wars.

1323
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,370
He's literally an old man.

1324
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:12,710
Yeah!

1325
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:13,990
He's just an old man on my back.

1326
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:18,950
Goku, you're Luke Skywalker, but Goku.

1327
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,010
I gotta see... Are you playing with pretty graphics on your game?

1328
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:22,970
I'm playing on medium.

1329
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,070
Oh, you're playing... I'm so jealous.

1330
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,890
I play on, like, ugly, sweaty graphics.

1331
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,590
So everything doesn't look as nice.

1332
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,790
Let me do it again.

1333
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,650
I know my place, so I can play medium.

1334
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,070
There's no point in putting it on low.

1335
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,350
I know there's no point in putting it on low.

1336
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,230
I'm literally gonna get shit on no matter what.

1337
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:46,930
Oh, your new model looks so good.

1338
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,490
He's in his skin suit.

1339
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,890
Oh, we're starting, we're starting.

1340
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,610
Oh shit, yo, we're going in, we're going in.

1341
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:59,270
Hey guys, is the volume a lot better now, chat, by the way?

1342
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:03,370
My usual sound guy, he's at Evo right now, so...

1343
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,550
Oh, what game is he playing at Evo?

1344
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:06,530
I don't know.

1345
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,230
I don't know.

1346
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:12,210
I know he's like, that's why he's like, oh sorry, I can't do sound check.

1347
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,410
Look at my Yoda, look at my Yoda.

1348
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,870
Oh my god!

1349
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,330
Wait, get rid of that crown, get rid of that crown.

1350
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,470
Yeah, I got rid of it, I got rid of it.

1351
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,990
Okay, you remember our Josh Plotter, yeah?

1352
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1353
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,250
We're pretty far from it.

1354
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,190
Yeah, we're pretty far.

1355
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,730
We got some time, we're chillin'.

1356
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,910
We're chillin'.

1357
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,790
Look at this battle bus, we're, like, literally vibing.

1358
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,050
Okay, alright, don't worry.

1359
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,890
I'm gonna adjust the sound now, guys.

1360
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:43,070
Uh, sound effects, music, sound effects, alright.

1361
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:44,750
That should be better now.

1362
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,690
Alright, drop now.

1363
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:47,990
Oh, just in time.

1364
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:49,770
Yay!

1365
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,090
Maybe you'll land a little short too?

1366
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,010
Like, we have all this side, so we should be okay.

1367
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:54,670
Alright.

1368
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,410
I'm gonna land right here, but you should pop your parachute now.

1369
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1370
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,450
My parachute is the dragon.

1371
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,650
Oh, you're using the dragon?

1372
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:02,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1373
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,230
I'm using fucking Nike kicks.

1374
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,170
You have Nike, what?

1375
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,250
Why?

1376
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,130
I'm using Nike.

1377
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,110
I see their fucking shoes.

1378
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,030
Yeah, I am playing on 60 frames.

1379
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,470
Why am I on 60 frames?

1380
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,370
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1381
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,190
Oh my god, Yoda is laughing.

1382
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,090
It is weirding me out right now.

1383
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:24,570
Alright, let's see.

1384
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,090
Alright, let's see.

1385
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:28,530
I'm grabbing the guns.

1386
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,170
Oh my god, it's so weird seeing, like, all these footstep icons.

1387
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,650
Yoda is really, really creeping me out.

1388
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,350
Yoda is creeping me out just looking at him, staring at me.

1389
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,690
No, he makes sounds.

1390
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:41,570
He goes like...

1391
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,810
Wait, does he actually?

1392
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:43,330
Yeah.

1393
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,490
That's fucking weird.

1394
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,170
Yoda, that's fucking cringe.

1395
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,070
Yoda, you got something cringe, dude.

1396
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:50,330
Yeah, don't be cringe, Yoda.

1397
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,410
We're trying to play a tournament right now.

1398
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,610
I'm thinking of our croissant.

1399
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:54,290
Yeah.

1400
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,290
Wait, there's a...

1401
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,930
There's a little crash thingy.

1402
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,250
There's a plunger gun here.

1403
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,850
Oh, that gun is so nasty.

1404
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:03,730
You should get it.

1405
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:04,490
No, you should use it.

1406
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:04,930
You should...

1407
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:06,170
It's hitscan.

1408
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:06,930
No, it's hitscan.

1409
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:07,490
It's so good.

1410
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,150
That's a plunger gun.

1411
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,270
No, that one?

1412
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,250
No, the gun that you pinged?

1413
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:11,970
Oh, that one.

1414
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:12,250
Okay.

1415
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,510
No, the one next to it?

1416
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,230
The one next to it is nasty, though.

1417
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:15,790
It's so good.

1418
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,490
Oh, there's a gun next to it?

1419
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:17,830
Oh!

1420
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,230
Yeah.

1421
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:20,930
That gun is so good.

1422
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:21,750
Wait, I'll give it to you.

1423
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:22,550
No, you should use it.

1424
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,730
You know how to use this.

1425
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,050
There's that?

1426
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:25,770
And then...

1427
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,790
Yeah, you use it.

1428
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:27,990
I'll get the grappler.

1429
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,850
No, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1430
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,210
I don't know... I mean, I kind of know what I'm doing.

1431
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,090
You don't even know what this gun is!

1432
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,590
I was like, what the fuck is this gun?

1433
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,270
I was like...

1434
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,330
Alright, here, I'm going to splash this in.

1435
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:40,750
Actually, no, you pop that big pot.

1436
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:41,150
Okay.

1437
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,270
Pop the big pot.

1438
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:42,770
Okay.

1439
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,310
And then I'm going to finish looting this.

1440
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,450
Alright, I'm drinking.

1441
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,030
I'm sipping my thing.

1442
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:48,710
Oh, we're in zone.

1443
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:49,350
That's good.

1444
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:51,110
Yeah, we're... Oh my god, we're hella in zone, too.

1445
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:51,410
We're chillin'.

1446
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,510
Okay, wait, I'm gonna...

1447
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,090
How was I locked in 60?

1448
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:55,710
What the fuck?

1449
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,650
I didn't even realize.

1450
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,130
Were you locked in 60?

1451
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:59,870
Yeah, I was locked in 60.

1452
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,590
I swear I, like, changed it.

1453
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,770
I wonder if the settings actually reset for you.

1454
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,930
I wasn't sure if it would, like, do it or not.

1455
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,610
No, it, like, half reset.

1456
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,410
So, like, I had to fix some of the stuff, but, like...

1457
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:11,630
Yeah.

1458
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,710
I remember changing it past 60.

1459
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:17,330
Oh my god, we're so much more fluid now.

1460
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:18,490
Okay, you see this, uh...

1461
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:18,810
This is so weird.

1462
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,050
You see this shield bubble?

1463
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:20,650
Yeah.

1464
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,350
That I just pinged?

1465
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,510
Okay, like, did you ever play Halo back then?

1466
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,810
Oh, actually, no, better yet, this is like a fucking Gibby bubble.

1467
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:26,310
Oh!

1468
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:28,790
You throw it at your feet, and it basically protects you.

1469
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:29,410
Okay, that's good.

1470
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:30,650
I think it's like 10 seconds.

1471
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,390
There's another one there.

1472
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,430
What gun is this?

1473
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:33,890
Is that a rifle?

1474
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,250
Yeah, they're all hitscan too.

1475
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,050
Okay, that's good.

1476
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,790
I have all jumping stuff.

1477
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:41,870
Wait, we have to move again.

1478
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:43,410
Oh, we have to go past Dusty.

1479
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:45,050
Okay, so we can go over here.

1480
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:45,890
We're gonna go towards the condo.

1481
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:46,970
Whoa, we gotta do this.

1482
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:47,290
Nice.

1483
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,990
Yeah, we gotta do it for good luck.

1484
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,210
Okay, where is it?

1485
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,150
Where's my...

1486
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,190
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1487
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,670
We're doing it for good luck, guys.

1488
00:53:58,750 --> 00:53:59,530
We need this.

1489
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:04,090
We are also not the last team again, by the way.

1490
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:04,570
Okay, nice.

1491
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:05,250
We're not last.

1492
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:05,790
That's all that matters.

1493
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:06,730
We are not dead last.

1494
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,490
Alright, let's go...

1495
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,570
Yeah, I guess let's go down here.

1496
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:13,550
I don't even have a shotgun.

1497
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,230
This is terrible.

1498
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:15,330
Oh, no.

1499
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:16,530
It's okay.

1500
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:17,210
We're not last.

1501
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,150
We're not last.

1502
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,070
That's all that matters.

1503
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:20,310
We're not last.

1504
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,210
Just be thankful.

1505
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:24,630
Let's see.

1506
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:25,390
Is there...

1507
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:25,970
Oh, we got movement.

1508
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,570
Okay, sweet.

1509
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:29,450
So, I have these jumpy pads that are...

1510
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,450
Yeah, I have jump pads, too.

1511
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,510
Oh, you have those, too?

1512
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:31,890
Okay, okay.

1513
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:32,790
Oh, in front of us?

1514
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,130
I'm gonna back up real quick.

1515
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:34,570
Whoa.

1516
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:35,510
I'm gonna do this.

1517
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:36,370
Pausing this.

1518
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:36,730
Oh, god.

1519
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:37,930
Wait, I got knocked already?

1520
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:38,750
Oh, actually, I'm gonna bleed.

1521
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:39,070
I'm gonna bleed.

1522
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:39,490
I'm gonna bleed out.

1523
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:40,130
Run away from me.

1524
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:40,370
Run away.

1525
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:40,970
Use the jumpy pad.

1526
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:41,470
Use the jumpy pad.

1527
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:42,270
What the fuck?

1528
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:44,070
No!

1529
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:45,430
What?

1530
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:46,430
No!

1531
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:47,310
Sam again!

1532
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,690
The condom skins!

1533
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:50,290
No!

1534
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:51,410
No!

1535
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,530
I got shot before I could even see them.

1536
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:58,730
Like, I was literally out of LOS, and I literally died because of ping around the corner.

1537
00:54:58,850 --> 00:54:59,170
Oh, no!

1538
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:04,370
It's because they land next to us, so their condom men are always gonna be there.

1539
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:08,190
Okay, now that I know they're gonna do that, I'm gonna literally play hyper-aggressive.

1540
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,890
Like, I am confident I can definitely kill one of them.

1541
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,510
I believe.

1542
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:12,590
I believe in you.

1543
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:14,590
Alright, don't worry.

1544
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,630
Now we can talk strategy.

1545
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:21,410
So the strat is gonna be that we literally kill these guys.

1546
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,150
That is the strat.

1547
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,110
No, okay.

1548
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:23,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1549
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,090
Yeah, we gotta swap.

1550
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:30,190
We didn't get a chance to use more of Dragon Ball Z, so we gotta keep going.

1551
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,890
We gotta swap Dragon Ball Z characters.

1552
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,310
Goku and Frieza just were not it.

1553
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,930
They were raving a little too hard, but not hard enough.

1554
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:40,710
Yeah, yeah.

1555
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:44,150
We gotta do different Dragon Ball Z characters.

1556
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,970
I have Cell, and you have Vegeta, right?

1557
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,750
Yeah, I have Vegeta.

1558
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,530
Alright, we'll go Vegeta and Cell.

1559
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,070
We'll go Vegeta and Cell.

1560
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,430
They're better than Goku and Frieza.

1561
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,050
So seeing how this team is playing though, since they're...

1562
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,350
I think usually what ends up happening, it's kinda like how Apex is.

1563
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:05,750
We're like, once you get a feel for the team that lands next to your POI, they'll basically play off of that.

1564
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,870
And the team knows that we're being very evasive.

1565
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:12,570
So what we'll do is that we'll be ready for whatever angles they're gonna hold.

1566
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,330
And we'll just play counter-aggressive on them.

1567
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:15,790
Okay.

1568
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:26,170
And if the zone ends up pulling where we have to run past them again, we can do a thing where we go towards the Loot Lake house on the island.

1569
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:26,930
Yeah.

1570
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:28,730
And then we can kinda rotate from there.

1571
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,390
Okay.

1572
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:35,710
And they're probably gonna either look for us from where we usually rotate, or they're just gonna not even mind us and go deal with the team to the right.

1573
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,590
And I think that'll be the plan.

1574
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,550
I think that'll be the plan.

1575
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:41,550
I have no idea what you said, but I agree.

1576
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,790
I'll just follow you.

1577
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,190
Just nod your head and say yes.

1578
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,690
Yeah.

1579
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,790
And then we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good, we're good.

1580
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:54,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1581
00:56:54,670 --> 00:57:00,030
I was like, alright, from everything I heard from what you said, I just need to follow you.

1582
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:01,190
Okay, I got that.

1583
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,010
I understand.

1584
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:10,530
I think what I should've probably did though, too, is just been like, oh, just, you know, give me bubble me if I go down.

1585
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:11,530
Oh, that's true.

1586
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,450
That's on me.

1587
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:13,910
That's on me.

1588
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,270
I didn't even like say any of that, so.

1589
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,230
No, I'm pretty sure they would've killed us because they were there so fast.

1590
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,910
They also had like, they had shockwaves ready for the moment they got a nod.

1591
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:22,470
Yeah.

1592
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:23,970
We just got unlucky on our way.

1593
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,490
Picking your sweats, condiment.

1594
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,230
What are these guys doing?

1595
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,150
And you chose condiment.

1596
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:36,630
Look at this team on top of the hill.

1597
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:43,110
They're probably some very colorful Fortnite skins, and these guys are like, no, we're gonna eat a condom.

1598
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:49,910
Fortnite made billions of dollars off of skin sales, and you decide to be condoms?

1599
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,270
Condoms are, I guess, the new thing.

1600
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:56,830
They're not even good skin.

1601
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,790
They look so ugly.

1602
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,750
Say it louder for the people in the back.

1603
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,070
Say it louder for the people in the back.

1604
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,070
Is it because it's hard to see them?

1605
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:07,970
Like, I don't understand.

1606
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,110
Like, what's the appeal?

1607
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,010
So, it's pretty much that.

1608
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,770
It's like, if you're playing on like, ultra pretty graphics, it's harder to see them.

1609
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:19,530
And then, also, it's like the, it's a very minimal, slim hitbox skin.

1610
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:22,770
Wait, it affects the hitbox?

1611
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:27,490
Yeah, so there are, I think it's like four different hitbox sizes in the game.

1612
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:29,250
Wait, this is sweaty Wraith skin!

1613
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:33,990
The reason why people play the bald Wraith is because it's a smaller hitbox.

1614
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:37,850
Yup, yup, it's very much that, so...

1615
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,890
It's a funny skin, it's pay to win!

1616
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:41,770
Oh, these guys are gonna fight?

1617
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:43,310
What the fuck is this tree?

1618
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,590
Wait, you can grow a tree?

1619
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:49,330
Wait, what?

1620
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,510
Are they growing a tree?

1621
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:52,430
What kind of condoms?

1622
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:52,770
What?

1623
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:53,850
They're gonna make love?

1624
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:54,650
What the fuck?

1625
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,170
You can grow trees?

1626
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:58,690
Is this Mr. Beast?

1627
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:00,370
Yo, what?

1628
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:01,950
Mr. Beast growing trees?

1629
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:03,770
Yeah, is this Mr. Beast growing the trees again?

1630
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:05,230
You know they have a Mr. Beast skin, right?

1631
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,690
Wait, did you see what happened to them?

1632
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:10,690
You saw they got jumped?

1633
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:11,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they like fucking...

1634
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,390
It's like what we almost did to them last game.

1635
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,070
Oh, they're probably gonna die here!

1636
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:16,770
They might die here.

1637
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,330
Oh, no, no, wait, they're resetting?

1638
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:23,550
Okay, so, you know how you respawn as long as one person is alive?

1639
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:24,090
Yeah.

1640
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:28,010
No, what I did was you can choose to bleed out very fast.

1641
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,330
So that way it respawns you faster.

1642
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:30,850
Oh!

1643
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:38,450
So if you feel like it's just gonna be like a sucky situation, you can just say, Alright, I'm out, bye, and then just respawn.

1644
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,410
Oh, but I have to live long enough.

1645
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:42,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1646
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:43,030
What the fuck?

1647
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,270
How do you keep growing trees?

1648
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:46,870
Why are they still planting?

1649
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,930
Is there Mr. Beast in a condom?

1650
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:54,590
What was that Mr. Beast growing trees thing that he did?

1651
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,170
Yeah, that was like...

1652
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:56,770
What was it called?

1653
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:59,450
I planted a bajillion trees in some country or whatever.

1654
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:00,910
What was it called again?

1655
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:02,830
Team Trees!

1656
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,370
They're fucking Team Trees!

1657
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:05,650
Yo, Team Trees?

1658
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,490
Oh my god, I'm gonna burn some plastic to counteract this.

1659
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:16,810
If you can plant trees in Fortnite, you should be able to burn plastic.

1660
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:18,570
Oh my god.

1661
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:21,810
Yo, yo, screw planting trees, you burn plastic outta here.

1662
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:26,010
Yeah, yeah, it should be like the nerf to the tree thing.

1663
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:30,430
In game guys, it's all, it's in game.

1664
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,990
Aaron's like, why would you do that, Doki?

1665
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:39,310
Like, if these guys are gonna plant trees, we just wanna burn the plastic in the game.

1666
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:43,930
Yeah, we gotta burn the plastic to counteract all the trees that they're planting.

1667
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:46,430
It's crazy.

1668
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,530
For anyone wondering, the hitbox thing is a myth.

1669
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:53,090
Oh no, that's true, that's true.

1670
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:57,170
Cause like, I think there's like three or four body types in Fortnite?

1671
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,970
I don't think it actually changes the hitbox.

1672
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,350
Peter Griffin's definitely not the same hitbox as this.

1673
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:04,990
Yeah, he's like...

1674
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:05,790
There's no way.

1675
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:06,390
Gigantic.

1676
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,750
Oh, you know we could play?

1677
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:08,290
Do you have the chicken?

1678
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:09,770
I do have the chicken, I have the chicken.

1679
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:10,730
You have the chicken, I have Peter!

1680
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:11,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1681
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:13,490
Yo, we could do the chicken and Peter.

1682
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:14,110
Oh my god, we're gonna burn the chicken!

1683
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:17,290
Okay, we gotta do it on like game four or something like that.

1684
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:18,690
Unless we wanna do it next game.

1685
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:19,190
No, no, no.

1686
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:24,950
We'll do Peter the chicken next game, and then game four we'll bring back Dragon Ball.

1687
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:26,530
Alright, I'm down, I'm down.

1688
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:30,230
Someone's like, they're playing wide hitbox, they want to lose.

1689
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,610
Oh, what do you mean that?

1690
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:33,890
That's like the Gigachat move.

1691
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:35,990
Everyone's gonna respect that.

1692
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:38,990
They're gonna be like, oh, I do not wanna mess with the chicken and Peter Griffin.

1693
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:42,210
They see our skins and they're just like, oh, they definitely don't know what they're doing.

1694
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:47,850
We can definitely farm them.

1695
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:52,690
Oh my god, I love how like coordinated everyone is with their jumps.

1696
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,330
Holy shit, these guys are sweat.

1697
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:59,430
No wonder my three Fortnite pro players fucking dodged me.

1698
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,690
Wait, they're all condom skins!

1699
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:04,690
Jesus!

1700
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:06,530
It's 500!

1701
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:11,110
Oh my god, they're all condom skins!

1702
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:22,790
I love how like Fortnite compared to Apex is like the strats to a 1v1 fight is running in circles to get a right hand peek on someone.

1703
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:23,830
That's literally Fortnite.

1704
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:32,490
Oh my god, I would be the only one that's not running the skin.

1705
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:38,490
Everyone's running some like condom skin and we're just like very, very colorful chickens.

1706
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:41,770
They definitely know where to find us, that's for sure.

1707
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:46,170
These look like NPCs fighting, they do.

1708
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,450
They naturally do.

1709
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,870
They look like NPCs.

1710
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,090
They say, I don't wanna be the main character.

1711
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:57,670
I'm just gonna be an NPC.

1712
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,910
Oh my god, all reboots are disabled now.

1713
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:02,750
Another condom?

1714
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:06,490
Yeah, we're playing an attorney, so everyone I think wants to be a condom.

1715
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,510
Yeah, everybody wants to be the condom players.

1716
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,750
Please show me somebody that's not a condom!

1717
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,970
Yeah, I'm gonna actually cycle through all the players.

1718
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:20,310
Oh, I got someone who's not a condom!

1719
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:20,710
Wait, who?

1720
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:21,050
Who?

1721
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:23,350
Uh, it's... who is this?

1722
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:24,510
Oh my god, this guy!

1723
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:24,670
Gene?

1724
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:25,110
Gene?

1725
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:29,050
Wait, they're all like... they have the same skin!

1726
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,110
Ew, there's another green condom.

1727
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,730
Why are they all growing trees?

1728
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,390
Oh, these are the like, OG sweatskins.

1729
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:38,030
Oh wait, there's more!

1730
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,430
Wait, can I cycle through the next one?

1731
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,170
Is this like a fucking skill?

1732
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:48,090
Why do some of them have trees growing or are they hiding in the trees?

1733
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,070
Oh, these ones have like, cat ears?

1734
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:53,170
Let's see...

1735
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:55,110
Oh hey, this is green condom!

1736
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,360
This one has green condom!

1737
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,400
Whoa, these chicks are from the Witcher, I think.

1738
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:12,420
Okay, so there's like, Witcher skins and then there's some like, cat ear skins that I can't find.

1739
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,000
Oh my god, they're all the same skin!

1740
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,980
Fucking beta male shit!

1741
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,940
Why could you do fiend?

1742
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,420
Be more fun!

1743
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,780
Oh, condom's dead!

1744
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,540
Fucking same skin?

1745
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,620
That's so like, 2002.

1746
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,360
Whatever happened to not being a condom?

1747
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:41,000
I remember back in the good old days when no one wanted to be condoms.

1748
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,360
They're growing trees again!

1749
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,580
I'm gonna literally use that call out now because of you.

1750
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:49,440
Yeah, I'm growing trees?

1751
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:50,100
I'm growing trees?

1752
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,220
Where's the individuality?

1753
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:58,120
This is what like, the other players that bailed on you missed out on.

1754
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,160
There's like, new call outs that no one else is gonna know.

1755
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:01,880
Exactly.

1756
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,300
You're just inventing new slangs.

1757
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,960
I swear, it's not fair!

1758
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,320
Like, why can't I burn plastic in Fortnite if I can grow trees?

1759
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,800
Like, it should be perfectly balanced.

1760
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,340
Wait, what?

1761
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,260
Oh, okay, it's the Witcher skins again.

1762
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,300
Oh, nice.

1763
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:21,980
Okay.

1764
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,580
I respect this team.

1765
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,080
Who is this?

1766
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:24,780
Oh, they're all anonymous.

1767
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,980
What the fuck?

1768
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,420
I think these are Witcher skins.

1769
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,780
Are these guys from Witcher?

1770
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,220
All three of them are the same skin!

1771
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,860
None of them are like different!

1772
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,840
They're all actually the same skin!

1773
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,100
Holy shit!

1774
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:42,080
Everybody that's alive is wearing the same thing!

1775
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,720
So boring.

1776
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:48,300
This is why Fortnite is competitive instead.

1777
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,880
I've been asked so many times, like, why don't I play competitive this game?

1778
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,380
I'm like, I like playing this game in a very, very dumb manner.

1779
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,860
I like it for all the giant toonie chicken skins.

1780
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:02,560
Yeah!

1781
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,240
Are you playing Fortnite competitive?

1782
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:09,140
All you see are these dumb, dumb condom skins in different colors.

1783
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:16,140
Then there's also, like, this is zero build, but everyone still builds ramps.

1784
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,960
Because there's fucking... they should be able to remove items like Smash Brothers.

1785
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,600
That's what I've always said.

1786
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,820
I'm just like, yo, remove that shit!

1787
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:29,940
Like, you know how, like, in competitive Apex, they remove, like, all the, uh, what is it called?

1788
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,040
The... the heat shields?

1789
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:33,060
Yeah, yeah, the heat shields, yeah.

1790
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:33,800
The heat shields are removed?

1791
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,320
But Portal Bunkers should be removed!

1792
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,320
In competitive!

1793
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:44,320
I'm pretty sure they are modifiable, but, like, I think they just leave them because they want it to be, like, how it is in the regular mode?

1794
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:44,880
I don't know.

1795
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:51,400
Yeah, they couldn't... Fortnite could... can have even more... Fortnite competitive can have more sponsors.

1796
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,080
And they force all of them to wear, like, funny skins.

1797
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:59,120
No, I would do that tournament in a heartbeat.

1798
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:02,560
They're like, no, no sweat skins, no matching skins.

1799
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,840
You have to be all different.

1800
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,760
Yeah, everybody... you know how, like, you gotta claim your drop spot?

1801
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,080
You gotta claim your skin.

1802
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,720
Each person has to have a different skin, so you gotta claim whichever skin you're wearing.

1803
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,560
Yo... yo, okay, I think you're cooking right now.

1804
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,760
I think you're actually cooking.

1805
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,000
You are cooking something, Doki.

1806
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,660
Is this the next tournament that's gonna happen?

1807
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,180
Like, I would actually do a tournament like that.

1808
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:30,400
That would be so fucking fun.

1809
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:34,040
That's, like, literally free advertisement with, like, for the other pieces.

1810
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:40,180
Like, imagine, like, the person wearing the weakened skin won, like, a million dollar Fortnite bucks.

1811
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:44,100
Like, and then, like, you know, the weakened get, like, free advertisement.

1812
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:48,560
And then, like, and then people be like, well, I want to wear the weakened skin.

1813
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:53,620
And then people, and then all the little kitties are gonna buy the weakened skin even more.

1814
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,120
Yo... okay, okay, no, no, no.

1815
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:03,660
On the real, okay, I'm, like, I'm even thinking, what if you do that and, like, you force everyone to not use any of these items, right?

1816
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,400
Like, it's all, like, just movement items.

1817
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:09,000
All, like, things that just add more chaos to the mix.

1818
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,260
That would be so stupid fun.

1819
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,560
That would be so fun.

1820
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,560
Just, you know, just remove all items in general.

1821
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:18,960
Just...

1822
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:26,140
The thing is, the reason why they need this is because Fortnite is so, such an open map in general.

1823
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,820
They don't have enough cover.

1824
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:34,640
And, like, Apex or, and, like, Apex and other FPS games, maps are designed to have cover.

1825
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:38,620
Fortnite is designed to not have cover because they expect you to make your cover.

1826
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,560
Yeah, so zero build players just go through it.

1827
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,000
They need to have the bunkers.

1828
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,260
The diet bunkers.

1829
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,920
They need the bunkers.

1830
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,600
Look at this nerd, he downed himself.

1831
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,880
My water's still...

1832
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,100
Oh!

1833
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,220
Condom dead!

1834
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,960
A non-condom team won!

1835
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:55,060
Yeah!

1836
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,300
We had a non-condom team!

1837
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,960
Yeah, but they have the same skin, don't they?

1838
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,600
Are they wearing the same skin together?

1839
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,400
I think they are, yeah.

1840
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,200
No!

1841
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,900
Oh, they're gonna win!

1842
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:06,740
It's like, it's okay.

1843
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:11,040
As long as, as long as there's no condom winners, we all win.

1844
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,720
They go against the meta!

1845
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,420
They go against the meta, that's all that matters.

1846
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,100
Okay, I put Peter Griffin on.

1847
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,620
Alright, I'm putting the chicken on.

1848
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:22,900
It's time to be a chicken.

1849
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:23,660
Alright.

1850
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:27,240
Let's see what dance, is there any cool dances on?

1851
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,240
On the store?

1852
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,280
Oh, yeah, let me, let me actually change...

1853
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,100
It's time to shop.

1854
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,040
My emotes.

1855
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,140
Wait, do you have Batman later?

1856
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,300
Do you have Batman?

1857
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:36,520
Wait, Batman?

1858
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:37,880
Yeah, do you have Batman?

1859
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,020
The skin?

1860
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:39,660
Or like the emote?

1861
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,080
Yeah, the skin.

1862
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,900
No, no, I don't have Batman.

1863
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,000
No!

1864
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,000
Okay, because I have the Batman who laughs.

1865
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,380
Oh, that skin's sick!

1866
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,100
Okay, actually...

1867
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,260
Wait, I have Mr. Beast!

1868
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,180
I bought Mr. Beast!

1869
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,520
Oh my god!

1870
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,440
I forgot it was in the store!

1871
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,180
I was like, I gotta have Mr. Beast.

1872
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,620
Oh my god.

1873
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:06,340
Wait, if we find the trees, I wanna be Mr. Beast and plant the trees.

1874
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,740
I don't care if we die, I just wanna plant some trees.

1875
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:11,920
Wait, if you were to play...

1876
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,720
Okay, one of these rounds, we have to do Mr. Beast and someone else.

1877
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:15,220
Who would I be?

1878
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,180
Who would you be?

1879
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,000
Chat, who would match with Mr. Beast?

1880
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,140
Who would match Mr. Beast, guys?

1881
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:27,560
I'm like watching him dance right now.

1882
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:29,740
Nia?

1883
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:31,700
Uh, wait.

1884
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,920
Is there another YouTuber?

1885
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,800
Is there another YouTuber skin that you have?

1886
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,900
Uh, let me see, let me see.

1887
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:38,560
Uh, there is...

1888
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,300
Oh, I guess I could be like Cabbie Lane.

1889
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,540
Uh, the guy who does the shrug?

1890
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,620
You know, he's really big on TikTok.

1891
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,080
He does the shrugging all the time.

1892
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,980
Oh my god, Peter.

1893
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,540
Oh my god, I'm looking at like the different emotes.

1894
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,260
Like the emotes that I could get.

1895
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,240
What the fuck?

1896
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,160
Oh my god, wait, I need to buy this.

1897
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,380
Give me a sec, I'm gonna hide my screen.

1898
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,020
Yeah, you're good, you're good.

1899
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,300
I need to buy this, guys.

1900
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,420
Okay, I'm gonna equip.

1901
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:09,980
Nice.

1902
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,140
Okay.

1903
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:13,820
What's this?

1904
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,500
Oh my god, he's fucking spreading it.

1905
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:18,720
Oh my god.

1906
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,220
I have so many anime skins.

1907
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,060
Wait, wait, show me the other YouTuber.

1908
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:23,420
The other YouTuber?

1909
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:24,300
Um...

1910
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:24,420
Yeah.

1911
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,700
Dang, I...

1912
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,280
He's partially on YouTube.

1913
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,460
He's like more TikTok, but...

1914
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:29,920
This guy.

1915
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,160
Oh, wasn't he like banned on YouTube?

1916
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,020
Wait, did he get banned on YouTube?

1917
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,540
I remember he like got banned somewhere.

1918
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:39,120
It was a Twitter.

1919
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,580
Oh, I know, I know.

1920
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:40,920
Oh, I don't know.

1921
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,760
Wait, how the fuck did he get any...

1922
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,380
How did he...

1923
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,800
How did he get a Fortnite skin?

1924
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,140
I don't know, I'm just a wolf.

1925
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:49,920
I just work here.

1926
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,660
Bro, somebody must really...

1927
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:55,820
Somebody at Fortnite must really, really like this guy.

1928
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,220
Just don't expect him to get a Fortnite skin.

1929
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,160
Wait, what other guys do they have?

1930
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,180
Let's see, do I have another YouTuber?

1931
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,960
I'm going through all these.

1932
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,860
I don't know if I have another...

1933
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:15,040
I mean like I might have like a gamer YouTuber, but I don't have like...

1934
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,100
I'm like MrBeast.

1935
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,420
Watch this, look who I got.

1936
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,040
Wait, who you got?

1937
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,020
Wait, what do I buy?

1938
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,600
Look at him go.

1939
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:23,860
Yo, I have the emote.

1940
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:24,820
I have that one, I have that one.

1941
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:24,940
You have the emote?

1942
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1943
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:27,620
Oh, did you get the new code?

1944
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:28,640
Oh, we just got a new code.

1945
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,060
Oh, okay.

1946
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:34,160
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.

1947
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,180
Did you guys hear that chat?

1948
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,660
The bot killer.

1949
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,200
Oh yeah, I should...

1950
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,240
No one is ready.

1951
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,760
I should change some of my emotes too.

1952
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:46,680
Emotes.

1953
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,660
Okay, what do I...

1954
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:48,740
I want to keep the Macarena.

1955
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:52,740
Oh, Christmas tree skin for MrBeast.

1956
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,280
Let's see.

1957
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,000
Oh, that's true, you should be a tree.

1958
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,000
You should be a tree.

1959
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:58,740
Yeah, I can be a tree.

1960
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:59,680
I have a Christmas tree.

1961
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,480
I have a Christmas tree.

1962
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:01,780
Okay, I need...

1963
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,740
Where's the...

1964
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,500
What's that emote called again?

1965
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,360
Which one?

1966
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,720
The one you were just doing.

1967
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,440
That's the Master of Puppets.

1968
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:12,980
Oh, Master of Puppets, okay.

1969
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:13,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1970
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,860
It should be at the top.

1971
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,420
Wait, where's the...

1972
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:17,860
Where's the fucking...

1973
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,300
Oh, there it is.

1974
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,220
Okay, I got it, I got it.

1975
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,760
I gotta make sure this is in there.

1976
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:23,800
You have it?

1977
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,000
Okay, let's go.

1978
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:34,470
Look at the guitar, it's like out of his skin.

1979
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:38,190
His body is so fucking massive.

1980
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:40,690
It's so fucking big.

1981
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:41,950
Oh my god.

1982
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:44,610
I'm winning in spirit.

1983
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:47,590
Go!

1984
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:52,390
Look at his giant toony eyes.

1985
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:53,810
What the fuck?

1986
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:55,550
How many emotes do you have?

1987
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,030
I have way too many.

1988
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,690
You don't even want to know how many I have.

1989
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:02,070
Oh wait, that's the witchy.

1990
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,130
Which one?

1991
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:03,410
This one?

1992
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:04,430
No, the bathtub.

1993
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:05,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1994
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:05,730
Is that the witchy?

1995
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,530
Oh, is that from The Witcher?

1996
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:07,710
Is it?

1997
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:08,990
Does he take a bath?

1998
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,890
Yeah, he takes a bath in that thing.

1999
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,270
Yeah.

2000
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:13,510
I had no idea.

2001
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,950
Oh my god, I was so concerned.

2002
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:15,170
I thought that was the witchy.

2003
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:17,770
This is...

2004
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:18,970
He has a little truck.

2005
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,170
Yay, beep beep.

2006
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,510
Beep beep.

2007
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:23,510
Oh my god, I clipped in the chair.

2008
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,070
I think you're gonna die first.

2009
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:30,770
But I will never...

2010
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:33,630
Holy shit, you have so...

2011
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:35,330
Wait, how do you scroll through more?

2012
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:36,750
Oh, there's more pages.

2013
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:38,230
Yeah, I got the classic.

2014
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:39,230
I have way too many pages.

2015
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:40,750
Oh my god, I got the classic.

2016
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,230
Oh, wait, I didn't win round two.

2017
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:45,830
Guiltiest way...

2018
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:46,770
Okay, not that.

2019
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:46,830
What is that?

2020
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:49,130
What is that?

2021
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,510
It's in a type on tiny mode.

2022
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:52,870
It's the AOT one.

2023
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,190
Wait, what's the other one?

2024
01:14:58,730 --> 01:14:59,410
What is that?

2025
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:00,610
It looks so terrifying.

2026
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:01,690
It's a silly bird.

2027
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:02,990
Oh my god.

2028
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:06,210
Oh my god, these all look so good.

2029
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,090
Do you have Futurama?

2030
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,290
What the fuck is that?

2031
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:09,770
Is that...

2032
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:11,410
What is that?

2033
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:12,550
What is that for?

2034
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,710
I think it's a DC.

2035
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,870
It's a DC co-op.

2036
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:18,910
Oh, it's from one of the DC comics.

2037
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:22,770
I have Dead Space.

2038
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:23,970
What the fuck?

2039
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:28,210
I'm in the classic Fortnite.

2040
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:29,230
Yo, the classic one.

2041
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:30,010
We gotta do the classic.

2042
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,530
Yeah.

2043
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:31,870
Wait, where do I have that one?

2044
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:36,990
Oh, hey, Gumi.

2045
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,130
Yeah, I just love Fortnite emotes.

2046
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:40,630
Oh, wait, I have this.

2047
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,690
Wait, no, I have this.

2048
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,190
Wait, where the fuck did I get this?

2049
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:43,790
Oh, Black Adam.

2050
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:44,490
That's what it is.

2051
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:47,370
Is that Kung Fu Panda?

2052
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:51,650
Oh my god, I get to look at Kung Fu Panda.

2053
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:52,590
I think it's supposed to be...

2054
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,070
There's like a master Sifu skin or something.

2055
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:58,630
Nuh-uh.

2056
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:02,970
They have so many things in this game.

2057
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:04,850
That's why I keep making this game serious.

2058
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:09,410
Wait, did we get it?

2059
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,430
Did we get it?

2060
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:11,470
Did we get missed?

2061
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:12,870
Did we get missed?

2062
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,370
Oh, no, we got it.

2063
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:16,470
Wait.

2064
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,270
Oh, no, no, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.

2065
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:27,570
I couldn't help it.

2066
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:30,070
Look at all these cool emotes.

2067
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:32,810
Oh, we just made it.

2068
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:36,290
We just made it.

2069
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:39,750
They're like, we're missing one duo.

2070
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:43,450
Who could it be?

2071
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:44,970
Who could it be?

2072
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:45,970
Nami!

2073
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:47,750
Here, here, here.

2074
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:48,670
Emo with me, emo with me.

2075
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:52,870
Yeah!

2076
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:55,970
Yeah, join us!

2077
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:56,250
Wait!

2078
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:56,550
What?

2079
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:57,470
It's gone!

2080
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:59,170
Why'd they bring us?

2081
01:16:59,410 --> 01:16:59,470
Yeah, no!

2082
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,180
Jeff!

2083
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,400
It's not even Christmas, lady.

2084
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:08,320
Okay.

2085
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,240
Tell me when to drop.

2086
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,260
All right, all right.

2087
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,260
We're good about now.

2088
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:17,560
All right, we're good.

2089
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,720
All right, guys, I increased the game volume more.

2090
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,320
I'm going to land right here.

2091
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,280
I hope the volume's better now.

2092
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:30,440
We're so locked in, guys.

2093
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,200
We're locked in.

2094
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,080
We are locked in.

2095
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,880
No one even knows how locked in we are.

2096
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,800
Yeah, we're so locked in.

2097
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:37,520
Yeah.

2098
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,080
This is the skin that will make us be like, we haven't been last yet, guys.

2099
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,540
We're so locked in.

2100
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,680
There's another team that is losing before us, and that's all that matters.

2101
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,020
And it's not us.

2102
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,440
Oh, I got a shotgun.

2103
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:55,560
All right, we're good.

2104
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:56,140
We're good.

2105
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,040
Nice.

2106
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,960
All right, I'm about to be done looting.

2107
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,920
Drinking some stuff.

2108
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,460
Oh, the chest is space now.

2109
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:07,200
That's cool.

2110
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,480
There's a llama over here.

2111
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,120
Oh, it's so risky for me to go for that.

2112
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:10,960
Okay, I'm going to go to you.

2113
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:11,520
I'm going to you.

2114
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,980
Oh, I got the same thing.

2115
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:14,960
Wait, J3?

2116
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,380
We're doing better than J3?

2117
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:16,920
That's right.

2118
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:19,000
That's what you get for having two Overwatch players.

2119
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,300
Oh, is that an Overwatch player?

2120
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,920
Yeah, they're both Overwatch players.

2121
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,240
Oh, I did not know that.

2122
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,780
Their team is literally the Overwatch team.

2123
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:26,900
That's what you get.

2124
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,420
Do we get counted as Apex players?

2125
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,080
I don't know.

2126
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:29,640
One at a time?

2127
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,320
I don't know what they count.

2128
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,520
They count me as the person from YouTube that they're bringing over.

2129
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:41,540
I'm just the trusty sidekick, the V2 werewolf chicken.

2130
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,120
The chicken.

2131
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,480
You're the Fortnite bodyguard.

2132
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,000
To make sure I don't die first.

2133
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:49,060
I'm going to bodyblock with my giant, sweet chicken meat.

2134
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,980
Yeah, you got to make sure you're not last.

2135
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:51,560
That's it.

2136
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,640
I'm the exchange student.

2137
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:55,220
Yeah, I'm the exchange student.

2138
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:56,520
What is this?

2139
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,380
What gun is this?

2140
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,240
I don't know.

2141
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:00,320
Oh, it's an infantry rifle.

2142
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,800
Which is...

2143
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,620
Actually, really, really good.

2144
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:04,600
I have one too.

2145
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,280
You can splash us.

2146
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,460
And then you can splash us one more time.

2147
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:08,700
Yay!

2148
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:10,120
Alright, we're good.

2149
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:10,660
We're good.

2150
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,420
Alright, so...

2151
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,480
Now that we're kind of on zone, we can watch out for this team.

2152
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,080
Or we can just keep rotating north.

2153
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:18,840
We can go over here.

2154
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:19,740
Alright.

2155
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:20,700
It's your pick.

2156
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,380
I have no idea what I'm doing.

2157
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,640
Let's rotate right now.

2158
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,420
Okay, I'm going to go down on the...

2159
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:28,140
Actually...

2160
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:32,300
It's kind of a scary rotate because we kind of got to go out in the open.

2161
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:33,080
Yeah.

2162
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,420
It is pretty scary.

2163
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,240
Do you have any, like, protection at all?

2164
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,360
Before we get pushed?

2165
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:39,520
I have...

2166
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,800
I have the shockwave grenade.

2167
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,120
Oh, you have the shockwave.

2168
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,140
Okay, you saw how it works, right?

2169
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:45,560
Okay, I'm going to give you my shockwave grenades.

2170
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,640
No, you don't want that.

2171
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,020
I don't think I can do the things they were doing.

2172
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,460
Okay, we can literally chill inside here.

2173
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:58,460
Or we can keep on moving towards...

2174
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,480
Wait, can we...

2175
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,500
Let's see.

2176
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,200
Oh my god, we can't go into the bathroom?

2177
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,640
We can't hide in the bathroom?

2178
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,620
What we could do is we could chill here and wait.

2179
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:14,160
Oh yeah, okay.

2180
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,360
So we're going to have to keep on rotating.

2181
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,360
We can keep going this way.

2182
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,000
So I'm going to go outside.

2183
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,020
Keep on following me.

2184
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:19,780
Hey, I'm following.

2185
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,400
Okay, okay, okay.

2186
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,080
It's okay.

2187
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:24,700
Did anyone die yet, guys?

2188
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,380
Nobody's dead yet?

2189
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,340
One team has died.

2190
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:27,820
One team died.

2191
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:28,760
Oh, good.

2192
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,220
Yeah, we're not dead last.

2193
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,020
Okay, good.

2194
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:31,520
That's great.

2195
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,820
That's what I like to hear.

2196
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:33,540
Oh my god.

2197
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,480
Wait, the Overwatch player is dying.

2198
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:36,340
Yeah!

2199
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,140
Oh my god, that's great.

2200
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,180
That's great to know.

2201
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,700
We can hide here in the bush.

2202
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,180
Oh my god, we can be bushmen too.

2203
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:43,740
Wait, what's up?

2204
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,120
What's up?

2205
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,100
I'm going to crouch.

2206
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:45,960
Wait, they probably know.

2207
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,060
I'm going to move to the left.

2208
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,580
Can I get an angle?

2209
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:51,280
Yeah, they're on rooftop.

2210
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:52,700
They don't...

2211
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:53,320
Oh, they know.

2212
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,200
They are at...

2213
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:57,760
Looping?

2214
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:58,320
Okay.

2215
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:59,840
Are they looking at us or...?

2216
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:02,100
They know that we're here.

2217
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:02,520
They're rotating.

2218
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:02,900
They're rotating.

2219
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:03,420
Okay.

2220
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:05,700
Oh my god, I can see the...

2221
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:06,640
Day one.

2222
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,400
Almost cracked one.

2223
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,140
Oh my god, they're planting trees again!

2224
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:10,320
Let's go left.

2225
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:10,680
Let's go left.

2226
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:11,940
How did I keep getting the trees?

2227
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:15,300
I'm going to throw on the side.

2228
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:15,920
I'm good now.

2229
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:16,220
I'm good.

2230
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:16,920
Oh, I'm not.

2231
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,040
I'm going to do this.

2232
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:18,440
I'm doing this.

2233
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:18,860
Oh, god.

2234
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:20,620
I'm not good.

2235
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:21,380
We're good.

2236
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:21,620
We're good.

2237
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:21,820
We're good.

2238
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,040
We're good.

2239
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:22,800
We can go inside here.

2240
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,020
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2241
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:24,860
Yeah, just watch yourself.

2242
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,240
And then, uh, let's see.

2243
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,440
Let me actually get an angle to, like, try and shoot them.

2244
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:31,560
They're still on the rooftop.

2245
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:32,240
Okay.

2246
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,860
We can keep moving to the next house over.

2247
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,160
So, let's go outside here.

2248
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,540
And I'm going to start rotating.

2249
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,860
We are safer now.

2250
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,460
All these minis here are huge.

2251
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:47,780
I feel safer inside.

2252
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,780
I think we can move over to the next house.

2253
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:53,980
Alright.

2254
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:57,140
I'm going to, uh, see.

2255
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:58,640
Should I break the wall?

2256
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:00,880
Okay, we're going to go with the back door like we did the last house.

2257
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,580
Okay, let's go now.

2258
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,880
Thank you, Fortnite bodyguard.

2259
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:05,640
You're welcome.

2260
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,880
Other Fortnite bodyguard.

2261
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,020
Alright, we're chilling.

2262
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:10,640
We're chilling here.

2263
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:11,040
We're good.

2264
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,620
We're good.

2265
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,900
Protect me, Fortnite bodyguard.

2266
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,640
Alright, we get to just hang out here until the next...

2267
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,480
Oh, they're in the bush.

2268
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,180
Oh, they're bush people.

2269
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,140
How can you be a bush person if you're not Mr. Beast?

2270
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,560
I know, right?

2271
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:25,920
These guys are...

2272
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,880
How could you?

2273
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:28,580
Oh, wait.

2274
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,700
Okay, I don't know if there's anyone below us.

2275
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,000
There's footsteps.

2276
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,080
I'm going to actually just move around.

2277
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:34,060
I'm going to make noise.

2278
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:36,700
They're on the other house.

2279
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:37,500
Get away!

2280
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:38,180
This is our house!

2281
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,020
Watch your back here.

2282
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,940
Because they could shoot you in the back.

2283
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:41,340
Okay.

2284
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,520
But they're rotating away.

2285
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,460
I hear you.

2286
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,400
Yeah, I hear them.

2287
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,800
I think they might want to fight.

2288
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,200
Yeah, I hear them.

2289
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,220
I'm below.

2290
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,560
They should get shot on the top.

2291
01:22:58,640 --> 01:22:59,660
What are you doing?

2292
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,220
I have my shotgun too!

2293
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,480
Okay, so you know how the shockwaves work, kind of, yeah?

2294
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:06,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2295
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:11,960
If they push you guys, don't feel bad to shockwave yourself carelessly.

2296
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:12,860
Okay.

2297
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:18,080
If you shockwave me into the storm, that's okay, because I can shockwave myself another direction.

2298
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:18,480
Okay.

2299
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:22,060
So, just play selfishly if they end up trying to push you.

2300
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:26,260
They're waiting for an opportunity to jump us, so I'm just watching around.

2301
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:27,640
Yeah, that's right.

2302
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:28,860
I have my bodyguard here.

2303
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:30,920
It's a fucking dog.

2304
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:31,940
Is there a rooftop?

2305
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:32,520
Okay.

2306
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:34,280
Oh, wait, they're getting shot at.

2307
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:35,320
Are they?

2308
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:36,880
Wait, no, they fell, they fell.

2309
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,580
Wait, are they rotating?

2310
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,820
They might be rotating.

2311
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,020
I think they're rotating.

2312
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:44,600
Yeah, they're rotating.

2313
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,680
Okay, okay.

2314
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:48,300
Okay, so, we're going to have to rotate.

2315
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,240
Let me see what's available.

2316
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,020
I think, is that in?

2317
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,880
Alright, so we're going to go out the back again.

2318
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,880
And we're going to, okay, I want you to slide run onto...

2319
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,720
Fuck, through that.

2320
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:03,360
Oh, team on our side, on the right side.

2321
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:03,940
I see them, I see them.

2322
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,540
Almost cracked them.

2323
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,840
Cracked, almost cracked the other two.

2324
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,620
I'm going to, we're going to shockwave to the other house over here.

2325
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,080
Okay.

2326
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,520
So, just get away from me, get away from me, get away from me.

2327
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:15,320
Okay.

2328
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,040
And then I'm going to shockwave.

2329
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,160
I'm going now.

2330
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,040
And I'm going to launchpad.

2331
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,200
And go this way.

2332
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,660
I'm looking for you, I'm looking for you.

2333
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,160
You're good.

2334
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,280
You're good, Toki.

2335
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,320
I'm looking for you, I'm looking for you.

2336
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,580
I'm over here, I'm over here.

2337
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,120
You're good.

2338
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:31,340
Yo, you're good.

2339
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,160
I did it.

2340
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:33,580
Yo, we're good.

2341
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,940
Okay, we're in the next zone, we're in the next zone.

2342
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:37,120
We're in the next zone, we're chilling, we're chilling.

2343
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:43,900
There's also a...

2344
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:46,540
There's a Gibby bubble right here as well.

2345
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,800
Okay, yeah, yeah, I can take it.

2346
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,440
Oh, we're also in the next zone too, we're in the next zone too, we're chilling.

2347
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:53,380
Oh thank god, oh thank god, I'm going to be hiding in the bunker.

2348
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,960
The fallout's coming, I'm going to hide in the bunker.

2349
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,740
I think we forced that team to rotate onto another team, so we're good, we're good for now.

2350
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,560
Okay, I'll stay here.

2351
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:09,340
I think I'm going to get onto...

2352
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:13,600
Someone killed the Overwatch squad already, so at least I can be better than the Overwatch people.

2353
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,660
That's all I want.

2354
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:25,680
I cracked one in Storm, but they're eating a lot of damage over here, so I'm going to keep pressure on them.

2355
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,380
I think I'm actually okay up here.

2356
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:28,540
I'm worried.

2357
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,400
We have this whole house.

2358
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:31,340
Okay.

2359
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,660
I'm so scared of peeking though.

2360
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,860
Yeah, no, you can chill inside, you can chill inside.

2361
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,060
Okay, okay, I'm looking into... I'm looking here.

2362
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:40,740
Are we still in zone?

2363
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,020
Yeah, we're still in zone.

2364
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:45,340
The team that you're shooting, are they still in zone?

2365
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:48,300
Yeah, they're still out in the blue right now.

2366
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,040
I think they rotated to the water side.

2367
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,340
Are you getting shot at?

2368
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,420
No, did you hear that?

2369
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,060
That was an RPG.

2370
01:25:59,200 --> 01:25:59,620
Oh, what?

2371
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,820
They're shooting RPGs at us.

2372
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,380
It was like...

2373
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,440
I was like, what the fuck was that?

2374
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,880
I think this guy went over here.

2375
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,160
Oh, thank God the Overwatch duo is dead.

2376
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,680
We're vibing right now.

2377
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,920
We're not vibing as much anymore.

2378
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:18,060
That is so far.

2379
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:21,440
We have the beach that we can play on.

2380
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,280
What the fuck?

2381
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,040
Let's see, what can we actually play here?

2382
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,880
I'm going to kind of look out for a spot that we can get to.

2383
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:31,920
Is that in?

2384
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,180
Oh, that is very in.

2385
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,140
Okay, we can get to that rock there, I think.

2386
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,100
There's also a team play.

2387
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:42,080
I have another shock if you want one.

2388
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,400
How many do you have?

2389
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,880
Oh, you do?

2390
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,860
No, keep it for yourself because I have launch pads.

2391
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,340
We're going to go with the zone very, very last second.

2392
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,720
You know how the crash pads work?

2393
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,880
Okay, just slide crouch onto it.

2394
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,900
I'm going to burn some right now.

2395
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,980
Okay, we're going to try to get to my blue ping.

2396
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:00,500
Let me go now.

2397
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,360
We're going to go here.

2398
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:04,900
I'm going to chill here for a sec.

2399
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,140
Oh, what's in here?

2400
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,200
Wait, did I get shot?

2401
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,020
Okay, no.

2402
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:10,980
No, we're good.

2403
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,140
We're going to do a slow rotate.

2404
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,860
We're going to be little babies.

2405
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:20,300
Is that team on the porta bunker right there?

2406
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,560
Don't blow yourself up.

2407
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,500
Oh my god, I see you.

2408
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,100
You're good.

2409
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,980
I don't feel good.

2410
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,500
I might be dead.

2411
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,880
I don't feel good.

2412
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,100
They're like in the ocean.

2413
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,160
I was so confused.

2414
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,120
They're over there.

2415
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:35,920
Wait, can I reboot?

2416
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:37,180
Oh, I might be dead.

2417
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,040
No, don't die!

2418
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:39,440
I can reboot!

2419
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:40,500
No!

2420
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:44,220
I might have been able to res you.

2421
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:45,240
Oh, you're still alive?

2422
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:46,580
No, I died.

2423
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,440
No!

2424
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:50,880
No!

2425
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,400
I was so confused.

2426
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,520
I was like, what was that?

2427
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:55,460
What was shooting me?

2428
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,860
He's hiding in the fucking bush!

2429
01:27:58,860 --> 01:27:59,100
I got shot.

2430
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:04,780
No one expects them to be in the water!

2431
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:07,020
Fortnite moment.

2432
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,260
No!

2433
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:09,920
It's okay.

2434
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,160
We did better.

2435
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:12,300
We did better.

2436
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,860
We did not die in dead last.

2437
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,860
We were 15th?

2438
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,200
Yeah, and we didn't die to the condom people.

2439
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:24,900
I died to the condom on height, but you didn't die to the water people.

2440
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,240
At least one of us is better, I guess.

2441
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:31,140
No, I died to a condom.

2442
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:31,740
It's over.

2443
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,220
You died to a condom person.

2444
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,400
I can't believe it.

2445
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,960
What the fuck is going on here?

2446
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:42,600
We actually did really good there, though.

2447
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,260
Look, we got our synergy down.

2448
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,140
Yeah, we're getting better and better.

2449
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,280
We're getting better placements.

2450
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:48,040
Yeah.

2451
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:55,360
We got 15th, 16th, and we don't talk about the other one, but 15th and 16th.

2452
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:56,640
That's pretty good.

2453
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,960
That's really good.

2454
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:59,120
That's really, really good.

2455
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,020
I'm proud of us.

2456
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:04,400
Against all these other Fortnite gamers, that's pretty.

2457
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,400
And no matter what, we win money.

2458
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:13,060
No matter how well we do, everybody wins money.

2459
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:14,980
Holy shit.

2460
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,460
Oh my god.

2461
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,340
How many bunkers is this one?

2462
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,780
Is the entire loot just bunkers?

2463
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,800
Okay, so I've been playing Reloaded with a bunch of friends lately.

2464
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,960
And my biggest complaint is literally the fact that bunkers exist.

2465
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:33,540
Because it turns into this, but in casual too.

2466
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,780
It feels like they have like 20 houses.

2467
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,180
I know, right?

2468
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:39,140
Yeah.

2469
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,880
When you play quads, it's literally like fortresses that you're going against.

2470
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,900
How many houses can you carry?

2471
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,640
It's four per stack.

2472
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,660
You can carry four houses?

2473
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,900
This guy must have like eight or some shit.

2474
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,740
There's no fucking way.

2475
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:04,740
I literally saw him build like four different houses, and he still had houses.

2476
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,580
He still has bunkers!

2477
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,640
He still has another bunker?!

2478
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,340
This guy doesn't realize that he's going to break his bush.

2479
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:18,660
He broke his bush!

2480
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:19,100
No!

2481
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:22,040
And he still has a house!

2482
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,100
So your reactions are filling me with life.

2483
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,780
Because that is all of my reactions when I first started playing Fortnite.

2484
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,720
And it still is the same.

2485
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:37,660
What the fuck is like the real estate market in Fortnite?

2486
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,960
They're going to burst a bubble?!

2487
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,280
How many houses does he have?!

2488
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,740
Wait, which guy are you watching?

2489
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:47,700
I'm watching this like JF guy.

2490
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:48,280
I don't know.

2491
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:50,180
He's either JF or The Anonymous.

2492
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:56,860
I'm expecting Anonymous264, because this guy has like fucking Anonymous mode on.

2493
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:01,680
But his team is like JF or something on Twitch.

2494
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,640
Yeah, his teammate has like 200,000 houses.

2495
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:12,620
Every fucking time he wants to advance or run away, he has a fucking house.

2496
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:13,540
Oh, here we go.

2497
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,640
Yeah, I'm watching JF right now.

2498
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:17,180
You see all those houses around you?

2499
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:18,880
He built all those houses.

2500
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,220
He built this.

2501
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,460
Maybe he's MrBeast.

2502
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:23,000
It might actually be him.

2503
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:26,240
Oh my god, he's the MrBeast that builds houses.

2504
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,360
Last game was the MrBeast that could plant trees.

2505
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,400
This one fucking builds houses.

2506
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,960
Oh my god, that's the RPG I heard.

2507
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,500
Yeah, that was the RPG I heard.

2508
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,540
Oh, it's the Christmas chicks.

2509
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,800
Or the Christmas hats.

2510
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:43,700
Oh my god.

2511
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:44,960
Oh, does he have another house?

2512
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:45,580
I swear to god.

2513
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,860
If he throws another fucking house down, I swear...

2514
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:52,120
Okay, this is why us FPSers cannot main Fortnite.

2515
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,460
I swear to god.

2516
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,100
The meta is literally you turn into a house.

2517
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:56,840
That's the meta.

2518
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,620
I swear to fucking god.

2519
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,740
I swear it's so easy to find houses too.

2520
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,420
Oh my god, please someone kill him!

2521
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,300
Oh thank god.

2522
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,240
He was ruining the economy.

2523
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:10,820
Oh my god, they're fully dead.

2524
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:11,480
Thank god.

2525
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:15,340
His teammate had a house that he was about to throw.

2526
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,300
I saw him.

2527
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,440
I saw him hold the fucking port-a-bunker.

2528
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:22,320
He was like, I'm ready for it.

2529
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,240
I'm gonna grow a house again.

2530
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,260
I saw the port -a -bunker in his fucking hand.

2531
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,040
I'm not watching condom men.

2532
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,840
I'm gonna watch somebody else.

2533
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,580
Wait, wait, there's Christmas people in the house right now.

2534
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,160
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching the Christmas people.

2535
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:37,080
Jesus Christ, they're getting their house being destroyed.

2536
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,580
Oh my god.

2537
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:42,640
It's okay, they're fine.

2538
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,220
They also built their own house.

2539
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,940
Oh my god, they built two houses!

2540
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:51,360
Aww, they have three more houses in their inventory too.

2541
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:53,780
Yo, that's cute though.

2542
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:54,780
Oh my god.

2543
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,400
The housing market is going crazy.

2544
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,700
That's four houses.

2545
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:00,240
That's four fucking port-a-bunkers.

2546
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,760
He has a big one right there.

2547
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:02,700
That's five.

2548
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:03,940
Does he have another one?

2549
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:04,400
Oh, there's six!

2550
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,900
He's complaining about not having a house anymore.

2551
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:07,040
Oh, there's seven!

2552
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:08,720
Oh, and he goes down!

2553
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:10,960
Don't worry, throw another one down!

2554
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:11,680
Eight!

2555
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,160
Nine!

2556
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:21,060
This one team threw nine houses in 30 seconds, I swear.

2557
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:24,700
And he had another one in his head!

2558
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:26,660
Yo, you are my inner monologue.

2559
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,620
I fucking love you so much.

2560
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,900
He had ten houses in his head!

2561
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:42,020
Finally,

2562
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:46,430
30 seconds!

2563
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:49,710
And he's like, oh, you can hold four.

2564
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:53,750
This man's entire inventory was literally just port-a-bunkers.

2565
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:55,250
He had nothing else.

2566
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:56,870
Oh my god.

2567
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:59,270
Alright, these are the new comms.

2568
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:01,170
I'm literally using Yoki comms from now on.

2569
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:04,510
I am not using any more of the comms that I've acquired throughout my time playing.

2570
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:06,470
Did this guy even have guns?

2571
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:09,570
I'm just gonna call it growing a house.

2572
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:10,970
There's no way!

2573
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:17,890
I think that guy that was watching had literally one gun and the other four spots were port-a-bunkers.

2574
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:20,010
Oh, the condom Gibby bubbled!

2575
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:22,830
He's doing a temporary house.

2576
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:29,870
Oh, they're making boobs!

2577
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:35,690
They made boobs!

2578
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:37,170
I literally saw it!

2579
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:38,290
Look, they're doing it again!

2580
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:40,930
Oh, they're making houses again.

2581
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:43,210
Yeah, it's boobs and houses now.

2582
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:43,930
That's the meta.

2583
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:48,790
Oh, he blew the condom away!

2584
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:51,110
That was actually a really good play.

2585
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:51,590
He recycled them.

2586
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:54,990
Oh, wait, wait.

2587
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:56,770
He's gonna grow a house on him.

2588
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:57,770
Oh no, he blew him out!

2589
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:58,970
That's so smart!

2590
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:02,270
How many fucking what?

2591
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:03,850
Oh, his teammate's dead.

2592
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:06,230
His teammate got a two-copy.

2593
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:08,630
Oh my god, yes, don't have to try this hard.

2594
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:09,950
You're gonna be in day two anyway.

2595
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:12,870
Oh, the condoms are dead!

2596
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:14,790
It's a 1v1, it's a 1v1.

2597
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:15,270
He's dead.

2598
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:17,230
Oh, another condom.

2599
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:18,590
Yeah.

2600
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:21,650
Three games.

2601
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:22,330
Wait, what?

2602
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:22,890
There's more?

2603
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:24,670
Oh, I thought there was another team.

2604
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:29,410
Chat's like, do we need to show Doki the port-a-fortresses?

2605
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:33,370
Wait, when did... Oh, the Christmas... There's another Christmas team.

2606
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:34,510
Wait, what?

2607
01:35:34,690 --> 01:35:35,710
Oh my god, there is more.

2608
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:39,070
Oh yeah, look, there's like a white one and a red one.

2609
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:41,550
Yeah, it's 1v2, it's 1v2 now.

2610
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:42,710
What the fuck?

2611
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:44,410
These guys third-partied!

2612
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:46,150
I was like, where did these guys come from?

2613
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:47,750
Oh?

2614
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:48,310
Wait, what?

2615
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:49,170
Where's the other team?

2616
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:50,590
Are these healing?

2617
01:35:51,610 --> 01:35:53,010
Is he just healing in the storm?

2618
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:59,830
Oh my god, I like how it's still like... a build-mode heal-off.

2619
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:02,210
Oh no, he's... Yeah, he couldn't heal from that.

2620
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:04,030
He's dead-dead.

2621
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,310
They won.

2622
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:06,150
Oh, thank god.

2623
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:08,530
I'm glad it's not...

2624
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:10,230
Doki, the people's winner.

2625
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:12,290
Or the people's choice won.

2626
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:13,990
We didn't have condoms win.

2627
01:36:14,410 --> 01:36:15,550
Oh my god, thank god.

2628
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:18,610
Two of the four games were not from the condoms.

2629
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:19,650
That's all that matters.

2630
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:21,350
The games were not completely cursed.

2631
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:22,250
They were not cursed.

2632
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:23,470
Yeah, yeah.

2633
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:24,790
They were slightly, slightly cursed.

2634
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:25,650
Yeah, yeah.

2635
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:27,930
Wait, this is... Two out of three.

2636
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:28,630
That's great.

2637
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:29,570
That means like...

2638
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:32,490
They tried so hard to be sweaty, but only one condom team won.

2639
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:33,870
That's all I wanted.

2640
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:36,090
Game number...

2641
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:37,030
Game four.

2642
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:37,630
Yeah, yeah.

2643
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:39,710
Are we gonna do Mr. Beast or Dragon Ball Z?

2644
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,050
Um... I'm down for Dragon Ball again.

2645
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:44,530
Or do you wanna do... No, let's switch it up.

2646
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:45,230
Let's do Mr. Beast.

2647
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:45,770
Alright.

2648
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:48,250
I was gonna say it was gonna be Capulet.

2649
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:49,130
We're gonna be a tree.

2650
01:36:49,690 --> 01:36:50,170
Oh, yeah.

2651
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:50,390
Tree.

2652
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:51,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2653
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:51,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2654
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:53,090
Alright.

2655
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:53,770
Let's see.

2656
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,170
And I'll have Mom's Spaghetti on my backpack.

2657
01:36:57,970 --> 01:36:58,370
Wait, no.

2658
01:36:58,410 --> 01:37:00,030
I should have like... Gough.

2659
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:01,610
Cause he's Mr. Beast.

2660
01:37:01,770 --> 01:37:02,850
I bet he loves golfing.

2661
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:07,840
Oh my god, but he could be the people's champion.

2662
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:09,640
I'm gonna be the tree!

2663
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:11,840
I'm trying to figure out my backpack.

2664
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,080
Wait, what is the tree's name?

2665
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:13,640
Christmas?

2666
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:14,760
No?

2667
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:17,960
Uh...

2668
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,300
I know I have them here.

2669
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:20,860
I could also be a big giant corn.

2670
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,060
Oh, I could have!

2671
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:27,540
Wait, I'm gonna... I'm gonna put... I'm gonna put a pizza delivery in my backpack.

2672
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,000
Maybe Mr. Beast is delivering pizza.

2673
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:37,540
I have an Amogus, but I could also put a... Actually, what would Mr. Beast put on the Christmas tree?

2674
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:41,060
Oh, what would he put on the Christmas tree?

2675
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,040
Do you have money?

2676
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,880
Uh... I might have money.

2677
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,860
I think I have a money bag.

2678
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,100
Hold on, where's the money bag?

2679
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:53,120
If you have money, we could put money in the backpack.

2680
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,420
It would make sense!

2681
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:54,940
Yeah!

2682
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:57,280
I'm gonna use pom-poms too.

2683
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:58,420
That's right, okay.

2684
01:37:58,420 --> 01:37:59,040
A briefcase.

2685
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:00,060
I think I have a briefcase.

2686
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:03,020
A briefcase full of money, let's go.

2687
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:05,860
We're gonna be planting some trees, let's go.

2688
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:11,140
Uh... I think that one might be okay.

2689
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,520
Oh, is there one with money, like, that's pouring out of it, Jack?

2690
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,340
Okay, that one's fine.

2691
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,320
Okay, we're using that.

2692
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:24,880
We're using that.

2693
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:28,580
And then... Oh, what are you using for your pickaxe?

2694
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:29,620
Oh, my pickaxe?

2695
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:30,580
I'm using pom-poms.

2696
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:32,440
Oh, I have the pom-poms too!

2697
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,540
Yeah, let's both have pom-poms.

2698
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:35,920
Alright, pom-poms.

2699
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:38,140
MrBeast is gonna cheer us on.

2700
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:40,740
Yeah, we're gonna go plant some trees, guys.

2701
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:43,820
Today, we're gonna be planting a hundred thousand trees.

2702
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,400
Alright, what glider do I use?

2703
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,920
I guess I'll just use...

2704
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,240
Oh, no, I have a money bag one, I forgot.

2705
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,800
It's actually money, like, flowing in the sky.

2706
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,380
Oh, my God, that's so good!

2707
01:38:58,420 --> 01:38:59,160
Wait, that's perfect!

2708
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,820
Yeah, do you have that one too?

2709
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:01,700
No, I don't.

2710
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,400
Yeah, but that's perfect.

2711
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,040
Uh, I'll do the banana.

2712
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:08,020
Wait, I have bling!

2713
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:09,140
Wait, is that bling?

2714
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:11,860
No, here's rockets.

2715
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:12,300
What is this?

2716
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:13,300
Skyscratch.

2717
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:14,880
What is that?

2718
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:15,400
Skyscratch.

2719
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:17,420
What the fuck is that?

2720
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,100
Let's see, I'll still use... Ooh, diamond!

2721
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:22,200
Wait, when did you start playing the game?

2722
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,400
I feel like we have a lot of the same Battle Pass stuff.

2723
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:25,380
I have no idea.

2724
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:26,900
I, like, play it on and off.

2725
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,780
That was me this season.

2726
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,440
When the season first started, I was like, okay, I'm definitely not playing this car game.

2727
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:40,780
Too real.

2728
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:42,120
Too real.

2729
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:46,660
Wait, maybe if they have, like... Do they have any money-related trails?

2730
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:49,660
I have a staircase.

2731
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,400
Ooh, go, Mr. Peace, go!

2732
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:56,220
Go support the trees, Mr. Peace!

2733
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:58,180
And cure the blind!

2734
01:39:58,340 --> 01:39:59,120
You got this!

2735
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,740
I'm gonna buy this, actually.

2736
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:01,840
I'll do that.

2737
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:02,480
I'll do that.

2738
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,580
The money bag item is called Goldilocks.

2739
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:06,540
Oh, I have that.

2740
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:08,720
Goldilocks.

2741
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:11,220
No, I don't have it.

2742
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,440
I bought a really good emote.

2743
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:13,560
Alright.

2744
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:25,440
Guys, if you guys want to support me so I can buy more... more cosmetics...

2745
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:30,800
Use DokiBird and support a creator.

2746
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:32,560
And then you keep that.

2747
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:33,960
Use code DokiBird.

2748
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,180
Use code DokiBird so we can buy more pretty cosmetics.

2749
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:40,920
Alright, this is... I bought a new dance emote.

2750
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:41,360
You wanna see?

2751
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:42,800
Yeah, yeah, do it, do it, do it.

2752
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,040
Okay, okay, okay.

2753
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,680
Let's see, where is it?

2754
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:47,680
Oh my god, where did I buy it?

2755
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:49,240
Did you just get it in the shop right now?

2756
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I just got it.

2757
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,400
I wanna see if I can find it from regular scrolling.

2758
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:55,040
Is it glitter?

2759
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:55,540
No!

2760
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:56,960
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2761
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:57,540
I bought glitter.

2762
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,260
Oh, I love that one!

2763
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:00,340
Wait, did you just buy it?

2764
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,740
No, I have that one in my inventory right now.

2765
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:02,940
Okay, wait, wait.

2766
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:04,300
I just gotta find it.

2767
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:05,440
Yeah, I need to find glitter.

2768
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,380
Wait, it's called glitter.

2769
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:08,980
Alright, there it is.

2770
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:10,800
Go, Mr. Peace!

2771
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:11,140
Okay.

2772
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,720
Where is it?

2773
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,560
Where's my main inventory for emotes?

2774
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:20,200
Oh, there it is.

2775
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:21,980
Go, Mr. Peace, go!

2776
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,860
Plant those trees!

2777
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:29,180
Show the world that you can be the next president of America!

2778
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,100
You see this tree here?

2779
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,060
I planted that!

2780
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:33,080
You see that?

2781
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:35,320
I planted that tree!

2782
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:37,000
I'm Mr. Peace!

2783
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:42,320
Save the world!

2784
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:49,380
Every day we get closer and closer.

2785
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:53,840
And also, lock 100 people into a supermarket battle royale style!

2786
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:55,800
That's what they want!

2787
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,000
But woo!

2788
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,120
We cured the blind!

2789
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,160
I planted houses in Fortnite!

2790
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:07,100
Yeah!

2791
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:11,800
Oh, we got the new code.

2792
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:13,300
Don't worry!

2793
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,400
Let me throw money at you!

2794
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:21,220
But first, you gotta do this grueling 10-hour obstacle course if you wanna want that money, though!

2795
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,560
And then I'm gonna give you V-Bucks!

2796
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:24,200
Woo!

2797
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:24,200
V-Bucks!

2798
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:29,580
And then you're gonna buy things in the video game using code Mr. Peace, and then I'm gonna cure you!

2799
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:30,180
Yeah!

2800
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:30,800
Alright,

2801
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:35,180
cool.

2802
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,240
I'm gonna get ready up for real this time.

2803
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,020
I'm gonna run the bathroom real quick.

2804
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:44,100
I will BRV, because I've been needing to pee.

2805
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,520
Maybe after you pee, you'll get better, too.

2806
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,660
I feel like that's gonna happen.

2807
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:52,540
I'm gonna exhaust all of my bad skills.

2808
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:55,440
Yeah, the moment you pee, you'll become a better player.

2809
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:56,820
It's happening.

2810
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,040
Alright, BRV!

2811
01:42:58,500 --> 01:42:59,300
BRV chat!

2812
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:00,700
Alright, see you later!

2813
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,820
Guys, do you guys think we're gonna do better?

2814
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,900
Guys, every game we're getting a little bit better, you know?

2815
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:10,420
As long as we're better than the Overwatch people, that's all that matters to me.

2816
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,300
As long as...

2817
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:16,520
We're better than the Overwatch team.

2818
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:17,500
That's all that matters.

2819
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,640
And also, yeah, we can only go up from here.

2820
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:27,480
And I bet you, we are the team that's having the most fun!

2821
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:37,380
I bet you, nobody else is having just as much fun as we are, because that's all we have.

2822
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:43,360
Like, we know our place in this tournament.

2823
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:48,780
As long as we're having fun, that's all that matters.

2824
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:54,080
True.

2825
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:58,600
If we don't have fun, what else can we do?

2826
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,060
What else do we have?

2827
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,760
We have six matches.

2828
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,800
This is four, so we have three more games.

2829
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:07,780
Where's the aimbot?

2830
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:12,600
Guys, you know damn well that I'm not pulling up the aimbot.

2831
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:18,740
I think I shot my gun, like, one time.

2832
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,960
We've only shot our gun one time.

2833
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,320
I know my place.

2834
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,560
I know my place.

2835
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:35,660
I'm just here to spend money on Fortnite and do silly dances.

2836
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,200
That's what you need.

2837
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:40,180
I'm here to dance!

2838
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:41,620
Yes, I landed one!

2839
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:43,780
The one shot I landed...

2840
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,900
The one shot...

2841
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:50,460
The one shot I landed, it hit.

2842
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:51,880
And that's all that mattered.

2843
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:54,480
That's right!

2844
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,920
Flex it, Mr. Beast!

2845
01:44:58,020 --> 01:44:58,380
Flex it!

2846
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:02,240
Yeah, why shoot gun when everybody builds a fucking house?

2847
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,080
We're out here trying to find houses to live in.

2848
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,700
Everybody else is just building houses.

2849
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,800
How did they find all those port-a-bunkers?

2850
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:10,640
Like, that's what I'm confused about.

2851
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:16,760
How does one drop spot have 200 fucking port-a-bunkers?

2852
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,260
I don't understand.

2853
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:23,000
When will I have my Fortnite skin?

2854
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:25,220
Guys...

2855
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,060
Guys, would you like...

2856
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:27,960
Want me to have...

2857
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:30,000
Would you guys like...

2858
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,540
Spend at least $100,000 on Fortnite if I have my skin on there?

2859
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,780
Maybe that's how what it takes.

2860
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:45,320
No.

2861
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:47,820
Guys, this is exactly why I don't have a Fortnite skin!

2862
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:48,840
I need commitment!

2863
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:49,240
Commitment!

2864
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:54,440
I need commitment here!

2865
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:57,680
I mean, maybe.

2866
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:01,200
Guys, I need some commitment here.

2867
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:02,940
I need to have a Fortnite skin.

2868
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:06,160
Dude, I don't even give...

2869
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:09,220
Okay, how many Fortnite players have they given skins to?

2870
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:13,240
Okay, Fortnite skins of Fortnite players.

2871
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:14,100
Other than Ninja.

2872
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:16,160
Other than Ninja.

2873
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:20,120
Is there actual Fortnite skins for actual Fortnite...

2874
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:23,020
Okay, not like I'm saying Ninja isn't a Fortnite player.

2875
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,320
Quite a lot?

2876
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,200
Wait, really?

2877
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:28,180
Wait, really?

2878
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,480
Okay, I'm looking.

2879
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,080
Okay, they have Ninja.

2880
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:36,920
They have Travis Scott.

2881
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:38,260
I forgot about that.

2882
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:39,780
All the time?

2883
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,840
Oh, you're right!

2884
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,400
I see Loserfruit there!

2885
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:43,980
Wait, you're right!

2886
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:47,480
Guys, I need you guys to spend $100,000.

2887
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,980
I'm going to shoot Fortnite an email and be like...

2888
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:57,360
I mean, if like... What's his name?

2889
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:00,280
The... Kabi... Lame?

2890
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:01,100
Lame?

2891
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:02,600
What's his name?

2892
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:04,200
The guy that shrugs.

2893
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,220
If he gets a Fortnite skin...

2894
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:09,700
Oh, because he has 81 million followers on Instagram.

2895
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,640
That makes a lot more sense now.

2896
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,180
Guys, this guy...

2897
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:20,980
He has 81 million followers.

2898
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:24,220
He has a video with Will Smith?

2899
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,340
Guys, I don't have...

2900
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:33,140
Welcome back, Doryu.

2901
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:34,580
Wait, what are we talking about?

2902
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:35,120
I heard Will Smith.

2903
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:38,740
Let's talk about that YouTube skin you have.

2904
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:39,940
What's his name?

2905
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,080
Oh, Kabi Lame?

2906
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,360
Yeah, Kabi Lame.

2907
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:45,640
I was like, if he can have a Fortnite skin, I should have one.

2908
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:49,240
But then I looked him up and he has 81 million followers on Instagram.

2909
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,370
And I was like...

2910
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,360
I was just like...

2911
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:58,160
That is insane.

2912
01:47:58,640 --> 01:47:59,480
That's why.

2913
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:03,360
I had no idea he had that much...

2914
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:05,660
That's crazy.

2915
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:06,840
That's so cool.

2916
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,560
People in my chat was like, who's that guy?

2917
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,780
I was like, this guy did a fucking video with Will Smith.

2918
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:16,440
Where's my Will?

2919
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:18,440
And they're like, where's your Will Smith collab?

2920
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:19,900
I don't fucking know.

2921
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,220
Wait, when did you collab with Will Smith?

2922
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,200
Will Smith answered my DMs.

2923
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:33,840
That's gonna be such a wild collab if you ever play with him or Kabi Lame.

2924
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,760
Do you even think Kabi Lame plays Fortnite?

2925
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:36,840
Does he play Fortnite?

2926
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,440
Wait, is that why he got a Fortnite skin?

2927
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:40,100
I don't know.

2928
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:41,760
Do you think Eminem plays Fortnite?

2929
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:44,020
Because Eminem also has a skin too in the game.

2930
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:44,940
Well, Eminem doesn't play Fortnite.

2931
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:48,100
He's just there for his music.

2932
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,700
I mean, do you think Lady Gaga plays Fortnite?

2933
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,800
I think Lady Gaga did play Fortnite.

2934
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,420
Wait, does Lady Gaga play Fortnite?

2935
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,100
I think...

2936
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:59,120
Wait, no.

2937
01:48:59,220 --> 01:48:59,940
She has to have.

2938
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:00,680
There's no way.

2939
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:03,480
She has like three skins in the game.

2940
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:04,620
She has three skins?

2941
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,820
Lady Gaga has three.

2942
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,980
Why does Lady Gaga need three skins in Fortnite?

2943
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:14,760
Lady Gaga has like, I think, two variants.

2944
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:18,980
And then, I think she might have like one that you can change.

2945
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:19,920
Like a different variant.

2946
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,020
There's no way.

2947
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:24,780
Wait, she fucking tweeted out about Fortnite.

2948
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:28,040
Wait, two years ago today, Lady Gaga kicked...

2949
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,580
Oh wait, no, that's just somebody's like Lady Gaga Fortnite account.

2950
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:32,460
I was like, oh my god, did Lady Gaga tweet about Fortnite?

2951
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,020
But no.

2952
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:35,300
She also has 170 million TikTok followers?

2953
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,340
Oh, for Cabbie?

2954
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,280
Yeah, I know about that.

2955
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:40,540
Bro, Brandon Urie plays Fortnite.

2956
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,380
He used to be a Twitch streamer.

2957
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:43,620
Dang.

2958
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,280
Oh, I made sure to hydrate.

2959
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:47,280
Wait, did I ready up?

2960
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:47,980
I did, okay.

2961
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:50,380
Okay, Fortnite skin.

2962
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,640
Does Brandon Urie have...

2963
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:53,580
Brandon Urie doesn't even have a Fortnite skin.

2964
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:57,360
If anybody deserves a Fortnite skin, it's Brandon Urie.

2965
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,100
Wait, who's Brandon Urie?

2966
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:02,560
Brandon Urie, he did the...

2967
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,980
He did like the...

2968
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:06,820
He's Panic at the Disco.

2969
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:08,460
Oh, wait, what?

2970
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:08,980
Yeah.

2971
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:09,420
Oh shit.

2972
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,360
Yeah, he streams Fortnite.

2973
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,180
I've seen him stream Fortnite.

2974
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,040
Dang.

2975
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:15,460
I don't know if he still streams it.

2976
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:18,100
I see there's like some singers who actually have...

2977
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,160
Like, time in the game.

2978
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:22,480
I know that...

2979
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:23,580
Oh, who was it?

2980
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,960
There's like another singer recently.

2981
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:26,880
Who was like doing a lot of clips.

2982
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:31,380
Because she streamed after Lady Gaga's skin came out.

2983
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:31,740
Oh.

2984
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:34,320
That's interesting.

2985
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:34,980
Wait, where do we go?

2986
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:36,360
Let's get it, Donkey!

2987
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:37,900
Let's fucking go!

2988
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,060
We're gonna survive extra long again.

2989
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:42,400
Okay, that's good.

2990
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:44,000
We actually rotated really fucking good last game.

2991
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,660
Yeah, we did really good rotate.

2992
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,200
When will we get middle of the zone?

2993
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:47,740
This is not good.

2994
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:48,620
We can drop now.

2995
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:50,020
I know, right?

2996
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:53,080
Wait, I don't think it's possible for us to get middle of the zone because we're at the side.

2997
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:53,960
When will we get like...

2998
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:54,620
No, I can pull.

2999
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:55,780
I can pull over here for sure.

3000
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:57,900
Yeah, where's our pull?

3001
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:00,220
I wanna live in this house right here.

3002
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,520
Are you being nice and cozy in there?

3003
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:02,980
Yeah.

3004
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:05,480
There's so many gliders?

3005
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:07,360
I wanna plant a tree.

3006
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:08,960
We haven't got a single tree.

3007
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,960
Oh, I will call the trees and we're gonna...

3008
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,160
I mean like I'm a walking tree, but planting one just hits diff, you know?

3009
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:17,940
Alright.

3010
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,700
Yeah, tree planting a tree.

3011
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,540
That's all we wanted.

3012
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,520
Oh, I got the shocking thing.

3013
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:28,100
Let's see.

3014
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:29,800
Please don't shoot me.

3015
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:32,220
Why would they shoot you?

3016
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,160
They would never shoot a tree, right?

3017
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:34,740
Yeah.

3018
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:35,380
They would never shoot you.

3019
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:36,640
Wait, I found a tree!

3020
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,120
Found one!

3021
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:38,760
Let's go!

3022
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:39,340
I got the tree!

3023
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:40,680
Tree meta!

3024
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:40,980
It's over.

3025
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:42,380
It's fucking over.

3026
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:45,160
I can't believe it.

3027
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,260
It's as MrBeast that I found the tree.

3028
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,560
It's like...

3029
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,540
I found two trees!

3030
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:52,680
Oh my...

3031
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,160
It's so fucking over.

3032
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,100
I literally found two trees.

3033
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,300
Your personal walking tree is running up to you right now.

3034
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,500
Oh my god.

3035
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,400
The MrBeast buff.

3036
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:05,900
I had zero trees going in for the last three games.

3037
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:10,100
And then on the fourth game, when I decided to be MrBeast, I find the tree.

3038
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:11,700
It was meant to be.

3039
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:11,940
It was!

3040
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:14,320
It's like MrBeast was meant to be a tree.

3041
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:15,160
It was!

3042
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:16,380
Is this...

3043
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:17,280
Oh no, it's a shield bubble.

3044
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:19,340
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of this then.

3045
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:21,580
See, I have the plunger.

3046
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,580
The plunger?

3047
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:24,140
Oh, you have the plunger and also have the pistol.

3048
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:25,800
Oh, you got the pistol too?

3049
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:26,280
Yeah.

3050
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,120
Oh, huge.

3051
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:27,920
Oh, open that chest.

3052
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:28,420
It's a blue.

3053
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,000
Oh, that's what you need.

3054
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:30,640
It's a pump.

3055
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:32,640
Oh my god, it's a bunker!

3056
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:33,740
You should have it.

3057
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,220
Do you have one?

3058
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:35,580
You don't want the shotgun?

3059
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:37,460
No, no, no, no, no.

3060
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,760
I would not be using that.

3061
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:39,000
What?

3062
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:39,620
What?

3063
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:40,600
What?

3064
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:41,320
Oh, okay.

3065
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:41,660
Alright.

3066
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:42,900
And then you wanna grow houses?

3067
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:44,340
You saw the houses work, right?

3068
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:44,820
Yeah.

3069
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,280
Should I grow houses?

3070
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:48,440
If you wanna grow trees, what do you feel like?

3071
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:49,160
I have shield.

3072
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,320
Okay, shield or...

3073
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:53,340
I'll grow...

3074
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:54,680
I'll give you the shield.

3075
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,680
I'll grow a house.

3076
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:56,240
Alright.

3077
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:58,280
I build a house and I plant trees.

3078
01:52:58,620 --> 01:53:01,480
The houses belong in this universe's inventory.

3079
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:02,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3080
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:03,020
It's immersive.

3081
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:05,460
Well, there's more trees here.

3082
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:06,020
There's more trees here.

3083
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:09,000
Oh my god, there's all the trees!

3084
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:11,400
Yeah, we got so many trees here.

3085
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:12,420
Oh my god, you know what?

3086
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:13,680
I don't need shockwave grenade.

3087
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:14,640
I'll have...

3088
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,580
Wait, maybe I do.

3089
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:18,080
Maybe I'm getting a bit too overconfident here.

3090
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,420
No, no, no, no, no.

3091
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:20,440
Let the confidence out.

3092
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:21,220
Let the confidence...

3093
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:22,600
Wait, this is our time to shine.

3094
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:23,300
You know what?

3095
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:24,100
I don't need guns.

3096
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:25,080
I don't need guns.

3097
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:26,720
Wait, we gotta heal you.

3098
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:27,280
I'm so dumb.

3099
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:28,580
I did not realize I popped a big.

3100
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:30,240
Wait, you don't have any shields.

3101
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:30,920
It's okay.

3102
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,220
I don't need...

3103
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:33,060
I don't need a...

3104
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:34,780
I don't need a gun.

3105
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:35,700
I need one gun.

3106
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:37,400
Is there minis here?

3107
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,300
Uh, can you...

3108
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:41,720
Oh my god, there's no heals here.

3109
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:43,220
There's no heals at all.

3110
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:46,660
I swear I dropped a mini somewhere.

3111
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:47,760
I don't need heals.

3112
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:51,320
All I need is a tree.

3113
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:52,940
Let's go this way.

3114
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:56,160
Cause I feel like that condom team is gonna do the same thing.

3115
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:57,240
We're gonna try to hold this out.

3116
01:53:58,040 --> 01:53:58,280
Alright.

3117
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:00,240
Oh, I see a chest up there.

3118
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:00,620
No.

3119
01:54:00,820 --> 01:54:01,400
Hang on there.

3120
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:04,060
We're good.

3121
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:04,460
We're good.

3122
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,520
Did you see shots?

3123
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:07,620
I'm holding the trees just in case.

3124
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:10,280
I'm holding...

3125
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:15,920
As somebody that has no armor, I feel like I need to hold these trees out.

3126
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:19,880
Yeah, if the moment that you get shot, just throw the tree down on your feet.

3127
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:20,560
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

3128
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:21,400
This is why.

3129
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:24,320
Oh, here, here.

3130
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,000
I got minis.

3131
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:25,740
I'm gonna toss them to you.

3132
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:28,080
Wait, you can throw items?

3133
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,320
Yeah, yeah.

3134
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:30,100
You can heal over there.

3135
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:31,640
And I'm gonna toss that one.

3136
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:33,380
Oh my god.

3137
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:36,000
What the fuck?

3138
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:37,180
Right?

3139
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:38,960
What the fuck?

3140
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,640
I feel like I should probably not use a plunger.

3141
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,660
No, you can throw.

3142
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:44,380
Oh, I throw.

3143
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:45,340
I'm a tree.

3144
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:47,340
Okay, yeah.

3145
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:48,400
I know that, but...

3146
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,060
Where do we go?

3147
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:52,740
Alright, we're gonna go...

3148
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:53,640
We're gonna keep going this way.

3149
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:56,560
We're gonna go on top of the hill.

3150
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:59,760
I've never been to the top of this area before.

3151
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:00,200
Right?

3152
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:02,380
Because the condoms keep, like, cutting us off.

3153
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,400
I know.

3154
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:04,580
They know we're right by...

3155
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:06,180
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

3156
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:07,440
Yeah, tree, tree, tree, tree, tree.

3157
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:08,180
You're good.

3158
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:09,280
You're good.

3159
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:09,980
Look.

3160
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:10,880
Oh, we're fucking chill.

3161
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:12,260
We're fucking chilling.

3162
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:12,820
Alright.

3163
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:13,860
Drink.

3164
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:14,980
I'm watching.

3165
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:16,120
I'm drinking.

3166
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:20,020
This team's gonna force to eat storm, I think.

3167
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:22,300
It's okay, we have a tree.

3168
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:23,820
Doggy, that was such a good reaction.

3169
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,020
Keep doing that if we ever get shot at.

3170
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:25,720
Oh my god, don't worry, I got you.

3171
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:26,060
That was really good.

3172
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:27,520
I have the tree out.

3173
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:27,580
That was good.

3174
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,440
I still have the tree out.

3175
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:31,620
Watching for the team.

3176
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:33,680
Okay, oh, I see them.

3177
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,460
Chill in there, chill in there.

3178
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:37,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3179
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,280
We're good, we're good, we're good.

3180
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:40,280
I don't think I have to meds for this.

3181
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,160
Oh, they're fighting.

3182
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:43,060
Wait, are they fighting someone?

3183
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:46,900
Okay, follow my lead.

3184
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,600
Stick to me and we're gonna go to the left, okay?

3185
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:49,860
Ready, and let's go now.

3186
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,260
Don't worry, I have another tree if I have to.

3187
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:00,160
We can technically eat storm still, but...

3188
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,600
Yeah, let's go this way, let's go this way.

3189
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:03,660
I'm gonna toss a little crash pad and we're gonna go to the side.

3190
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,120
I'm gonna toss another one.

3191
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:07,220
We're gonna go over here.

3192
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:08,440
Oh no.

3193
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,420
And then there's a medkit here.

3194
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:11,440
Oh, I need that.

3195
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,900
I need that medkit so badly.

3196
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,240
Take the medkit.

3197
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,040
I need that so badly.

3198
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:18,040
Oh, there's also a big pod here too.

3199
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:19,180
Oh, there's another medkit here.

3200
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:19,640
We're good.

3201
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:22,520
I'm okay.

3202
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,120
We are a group, John.

3203
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:24,960
We are literally a group.

3204
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:28,400
Oh no, I have to ditch it.

3205
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:29,940
I have to ditch it for meds.

3206
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:33,260
I think we're still chilling.

3207
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:34,000
We're chilling.

3208
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:36,740
Alright, and then we can start running up the hill here.

3209
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:38,900
Don't worry, my tree...

3210
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:41,320
I hear gunshots to my left.

3211
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:42,280
Oh, team up here.

3212
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:44,680
I'm gonna bubble you.

3213
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,000
Oh, they put a bunker.

3214
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:47,760
So we're gonna... I'm gonna cut to the left.

3215
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:48,500
I'm gonna cut to the left.

3216
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:49,440
Follow me.

3217
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:50,860
And we're gonna use the bunk.

3218
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:51,380
Or this.

3219
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:53,560
What the...

3220
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:53,860
Tree!

3221
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:54,980
Tree!

3222
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:56,400
I'm gonna bug.

3223
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:57,240
No!

3224
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:58,080
No!

3225
01:56:58,420 --> 01:56:59,100
It bugged me.

3226
01:56:59,180 --> 01:56:59,660
Play your life.

3227
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,140
Tree!

3228
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:01,260
Tree!

3229
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:02,720
Tree!

3230
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:06,020
Nice try.

3231
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,060
Nice try.

3232
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:09,520
Nice try.

3233
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:10,480
I can't believe it.

3234
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:11,480
It fell.

3235
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,880
It's okay, I planted enough trees.

3236
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:19,120
Honestly, I'm really, really proud of how you're playing that.

3237
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:20,220
You're actually doing really good.

3238
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:22,860
I unfortunately... I died to a bug, Doki.

3239
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:23,900
Wait, what happened?

3240
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:27,860
My characters, like, didn't teleport or didn't jump on the pad.

3241
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:30,660
It, like, glitched me into the ground.

3242
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,220
And then I had to run back on it.

3243
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:33,980
Yeah.

3244
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,420
I was like, well, GG's me.

3245
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:39,260
How did they count in the tree strat?

3246
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:42,220
I should have used my shot grenades.

3247
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:45,900
I should have used my shot grenades instead of tree.

3248
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:47,140
Honestly, I think what we're gonna do...

3249
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:48,160
We're gonna do what this team's doing.

3250
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,580
You see how they're just living in storm right now?

3251
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,240
Yeah, yeah.

3252
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:54,980
We can live so long if we just prioritize, like, medkits and stuff.

3253
01:57:55,100 --> 01:57:55,560
Wait, really?

3254
01:57:55,580 --> 01:57:56,460
I think we're gonna do that.

3255
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,300
Yeah, like, look how long they get to live out here.

3256
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,740
Oh!

3257
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:00,520
Yeah.

3258
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,200
We're gonna definitely do that next game.

3259
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:03,520
I think that'll be the strat.

3260
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:06,300
We saved the environment by planting trees.

3261
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:10,100
We planted, like, at least five trees.

3262
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,600
Bro, they hate trees.

3263
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,680
These guys hate the environment!

3264
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,280
Cancel them!

3265
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:21,440
They don't want MrBeast to save the world or Fortnite.

3266
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,420
They could have let everyone just plant trees.

3267
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:27,520
Exactly!

3268
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:29,860
They also don't even want anyone to have houses.

3269
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:30,620
They're buying?

3270
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:32,220
Wait, what?

3271
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:33,900
They did not have shields.

3272
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:34,860
That's crazy.

3273
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,440
They can shop?

3274
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:39,960
Yeah, if you have enough gold.

3275
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:42,520
I think they've been, like, getting a lot of gold from the chests.

3276
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,740
They can basically just keep on healing.

3277
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:45,900
What the fuck?

3278
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,920
These guys are just healing!

3279
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:53,640
I thought buying wasn't allowed.

3280
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:57,720
No, buying is allowed.

3281
01:58:57,820 --> 01:58:59,420
They just reset the gold each game.

3282
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:00,040
Oh!

3283
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:02,120
So you have to literally start from zero.

3284
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,940
Maybe that's for day two.

3285
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:08,800
Oh, that might be tomorrow or whatever.

3286
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:14,660
Yeah, I think that was day two.

3287
01:59:15,180 --> 01:59:18,100
I'm going to send Fortnite an email and tell them to make me a Fortnite skin.

3288
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:24,220
You gotta be your own skin, but then they're going to throw a little Christmas hat on you.

3289
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:27,700
It's like, make me a Fortnite skin.

3290
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:30,400
I will be a Fortnite streamer if you give me a...

3291
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,120
Yeah!

3292
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:35,820
They kind of have my skin in the game.

3293
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:36,840
There's a werewolf in here.

3294
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:41,840
I usually like running the werewolf team.

3295
01:59:42,380 --> 01:59:45,620
There is a day two, but we're not making it to day two.

3296
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:48,560
What if we actually do make it to day two?

3297
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:49,360
Is it day two?

3298
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,600
Like, you gotta make it?

3299
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:53,000
Wait, what?

3300
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:53,980
Hold on, let me see...

3301
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:55,140
Do we have to play day two?

3302
01:59:57,660 --> 01:59:58,500
I thought day...

3303
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:01,420
Oh, I think we are playing day two.

3304
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:02,480
I'm pretty sure.

3305
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:04,100
We're playing day two?

3306
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:09,500
I thought day two was like, we gotta make it.

3307
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,780
No, I think we're actually playing day two.

3308
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,380
Wait, what the fuck?

3309
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:18,400
Total number of first place finishes.

3310
02:00:21,140 --> 02:00:22,740
Total number of elims.

3311
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,460
Wait, why is there a day two?

3312
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:30,460
It's gonna be on normal mode, so it won't even be on OG.

3313
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:34,460
It's just gonna be like all the new stuff.

3314
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,860
Wait, I think...

3315
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:44,140
Yeah, I think we played day two.

3316
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:44,880
We played day two?

3317
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:46,660
I don't see anything saying that we have to qualify.

3318
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:47,980
Yeah, we literally just played day two.

3319
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:49,700
But like, what's the point?

3320
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,680
The suffer more joke.

3321
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:57,240
It's just the same game.

3322
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,780
Wait, what's the difference between day one and day two?

3323
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:05,620
On day two, it's gonna be the current build of the game.

3324
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:08,400
Cause this is like a special mode that came out.

3325
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:10,280
Oh, this is three strikes.

3326
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,040
Yeah, it's like three strikes basically.

3327
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:13,140
This is three strikes.

3328
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:14,980
And then the other ones could be like regular.

3329
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:19,320
Wait, so does the regular also have bunkers?

3330
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:23,080
Um, regular has... yes, it does have bunkers.

3331
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:23,640
But...

3332
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:24,000
What's the difference?

3333
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:32,340
There is way more... there's like different weapons and different like movement items and all that stuff.

3334
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:35,940
So it's like a way, way different like style of the game.

3335
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:37,560
I see.

3336
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:42,600
Oh, it's just no reboots.

3337
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,300
Yeah, no reboots.

3338
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:46,740
All right, guys, we're gonna plant more trees tomorrow.

3339
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,780
Guys, I read the rules wrong.

3340
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:56,200
I thought it was... I thought like day one is like qualifies.

3341
02:01:57,020 --> 02:02:01,140
And then day two is like, you don't qualify, you don't have to play it.

3342
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:02,720
So I was like, I'm not gonna qualify.

3343
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:08,240
What I don't see is like, I don't know like what place gets paid what?

3344
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:13,400
Cause like whenever I played in Twitch Rivals, it's usually everyone gets like paid.

3345
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:14,700
Yeah, no, everybody gets paid.

3346
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:15,020
Yeah.

3347
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:16,320
Oh, that's cool.

3348
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,100
So we just have to exist.

3349
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:19,240
Yeah, exactly.

3350
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,600
We just have to exist.

3351
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:26,340
We get like literally $125 by just existing.

3352
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:28,240
$125 McChickens.

3353
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:29,880
Yeah, that's actually pretty good.

3354
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:32,860
Under $25 just by existing.

3355
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:35,340
And we're making memories.

3356
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:36,980
We're having a good time.

3357
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:39,560
We're literally watching houses get built.

3358
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:41,280
We're watching trees get planted.

3359
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:42,160
Exactly.

3360
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:43,280
We're planting the trees.

3361
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:46,360
And we're also doing it together.

3362
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:50,860
Now I understand why the three Fortnite pros were like, I can't do two days with her.

3363
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:59,440
Cause like, I guess I like feel like one day then they're fine with that.

3364
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:03,100
But like two days might be like a bit too much with me.

3365
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:04,740
Never.

3366
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:08,460
They just don't know how insanely cracked you are.

3367
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:10,900
The moment that you get your time to shine.

3368
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:12,060
Yeah, exactly.

3369
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:13,060
This is just the beginning arc.

3370
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:15,080
We didn't have time to shine yet.

3371
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:16,080
We didn't have...

3372
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,660
We didn't have our moment.

3373
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:22,980
We didn't have a proper gunfight.

3374
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:27,220
Basically get to just watch everyone else.

3375
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:30,760
And we're gonna thrive off of everyone else's energy.

3376
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:31,280
Yeah, yeah.

3377
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:33,140
Like we're gathering...

3378
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:36,340
Like I'm learning how to play the game right now by watching others.

3379
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:39,700
Oh, thank God.

3380
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:40,380
Get rid...

3381
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:41,960
Oh, what the fuck?

3382
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:44,520
Holy shit.

3383
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:45,960
Who is this guy?

3384
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:49,840
I love that they're using the mammoth pistol.

3385
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:51,760
That's that like revolver that they're using.

3386
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:53,260
Oh my God.

3387
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:55,460
That pistol is actually so good.

3388
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:56,360
That guy is crazy.

3389
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:58,260
Oh, never mind.

3390
02:03:58,860 --> 02:04:01,040
Get fucking comedy or curse.

3391
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:05,580
That's fucking right.

3392
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:07,480
Oh, it's my condoms.

3393
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,600
The reboot's disabled.

3394
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:11,080
Oh, it's the condoms again.

3395
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:15,920
I feel like the storm doesn't hurt as much.

3396
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:17,260
Because this is...

3397
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:18,260
This is build mode.

3398
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:19,440
I mean, zero build mode.

3399
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:21,540
Sorry.

3400
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:23,020
He's gonna die in zone.

3401
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:25,960
Is he gonna live?

3402
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:28,160
Oh, by building a house.

3403
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:29,260
That sounds right.

3404
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:33,340
Oh, condom down.

3405
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:34,060
Condom down.

3406
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:35,180
Wow, they're just...

3407
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,760
He's just throwing their game.

3408
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:38,640
Condom dead.

3409
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:40,580
By the other condoms.

3410
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:41,060
What the fuck?

3411
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:42,520
What the fuck was that flick?

3412
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,960
He actually hit it too.

3413
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:47,580
Oh, this guy's actually one HP.

3414
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:49,600
Oh my God.

3415
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,640
Wait, why is he dropping a weapon?

3416
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:55,080
He has enough slots.

3417
02:04:58,940 --> 02:05:01,260
Wait, why did he drop his weapon?

3418
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:02,620
I don't understand Fortnite players.

3419
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,500
He has enough item slots for this.

3420
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,000
Oh, they get to splash some HP?

3421
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:10,800
He said.

3422
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:11,400
There's no...

3423
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:11,560
Yeah.

3424
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:14,880
Oh, that's a skin I haven't seen before.

3425
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:15,960
Wait, which one?

3426
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:17,220
Oh, I'm going to another team.

3427
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,120
Oh my God.

3428
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:20,380
They actually have not matching skins.

3429
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:21,900
I like this team.

3430
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:23,220
Wait, this is a team.

3431
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:23,960
Oh, it's this guy.

3432
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:24,800
They swapped skins.

3433
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:26,960
Wait, which...

3434
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,320
Oh, is it the guys with the pink skirt?

3435
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:29,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3436
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:31,160
They actually have skins that don't match.

3437
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:31,840
Yo.

3438
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:34,220
They actually have color in their skin.

3439
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:36,220
That's crazy.

3440
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:38,560
Seeing like actual color.

3441
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:42,200
Oh, the guy's going to heal.

3442
02:05:44,180 --> 02:05:45,420
We're still like...

3443
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:46,500
There's still so many teams.

3444
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:47,420
What the fuck?

3445
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:48,060
Oh.

3446
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:55,080
I love watching this with you because like, even though I know what's going on.

3447
02:05:55,780 --> 02:06:00,240
It's why I don't play this game competitively because the tick rate is horrible in this game.

3448
02:06:00,380 --> 02:06:01,000
Oh, is it?

3449
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:04,540
And yeah, in like in zero build, it's literally like diet build mode.

3450
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,100
Oh.

3451
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:07,840
And for me, I'm just like, yo, I'm not trying to play diet build mode.

3452
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:10,520
Like I chose zero build for WKing.

3453
02:06:12,860 --> 02:06:13,360
You really?

3454
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:14,600
I wish you can just edit.

3455
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:17,540
Like the organizers just don't tell anybody.

3456
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:21,380
They just edit the bunker to like 1% spawn rate.

3457
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,000
I wish you could just do that.

3458
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,600
Oh, that'd be so sick.

3459
02:06:25,940 --> 02:06:30,860
For one game, they edit the spawn rate to 1% and I just want to know what they're going to do.

3460
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:34,060
I want to know what the players would do.

3461
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:36,940
Like, what do we do?

3462
02:06:36,940 --> 02:06:37,280
What do we do?

3463
02:06:37,400 --> 02:06:37,820
I can't build.

3464
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:38,240
I can't build.

3465
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:38,920
I can't believe it.

3466
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:41,200
The place I landed had no bunkers.

3467
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:42,400
Like, what is my luck?

3468
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:43,920
And then everybody just doesn't know.

3469
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:45,620
That's not that they have terrible luck.

3470
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:47,360
It's that it just wasn't spawning.

3471
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:48,220
Right?

3472
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,220
It's like, my RNG is horrible, actually.

3473
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:54,700
Oh, I'm rooting for this team.

3474
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:55,740
The colorful team.

3475
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:56,780
Yeah, the colorful team.

3476
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:58,020
As long as they beat the condom team.

3477
02:06:58,080 --> 02:06:59,100
That's all that matters.

3478
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:01,780
That's all that matters to me.

3479
02:07:02,260 --> 02:07:03,300
Oh, they shockwave now?

3480
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:04,380
Oh!

3481
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:07,280
Oh my god, the reaction time for it.

3482
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:09,520
And they rebuilt the house.

3483
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:10,200
Right?

3484
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:13,060
They actually rebuilt the house.

3485
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:14,160
Holy shit.

3486
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,680
What the fuck?

3487
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:21,320
The thing is that this is only slightly sweatier than normal reload lobbies.

3488
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,840
I wouldn't say slightly.

3489
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,120
Like, it's definitely sweatier.

3490
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:26,300
But like, reload lobbies are pretty sweaty.

3491
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:29,300
They're like diet rank mode.

3492
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:33,900
Oh my god.

3493
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:35,380
Are they going to shockwave them out?

3494
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:36,700
Is that a shockwave?

3495
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:39,140
Wait.

3496
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:41,560
How come we can't do that together?

3497
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:43,140
Oh, they're going to build a house.

3498
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:43,840
They're going to build a house.

3499
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:44,880
Oh my god, they did it.

3500
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:45,680
They built the house.

3501
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:48,580
Let's go, colorful team.

3502
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:52,620
Oh, and they're destroying...

3503
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:54,120
Oh no, I missed that one.

3504
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:56,540
How do you hit it so that it destroys it?

3505
02:07:57,540 --> 02:08:02,000
You have to basically throw it at an angle where it's going to connect with the player next to it.

3506
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,040
Oh, so it has to connect to the player.

3507
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:06,340
Oh, so the launch bricks that has...

3508
02:08:06,340 --> 02:08:07,760
It has to be like an LOS, yeah.

3509
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:09,900
Oh, that makes sense.

3510
02:08:09,980 --> 02:08:11,440
Wait, somebody's living behind them.

3511
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:12,440
They're squatters.

3512
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,300
Oh, the squatters are gone.

3513
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:17,640
Let's go, colorful team.

3514
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:18,340
Yeah!

3515
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:20,840
Oh shit.

3516
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:22,380
Who the fuck shot him?

3517
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:23,280
Yeah, right?

3518
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:25,360
Yeah, who the fuck shot him?

3519
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:27,300
Shoosh, get out of here.

3520
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:29,860
Dude's shooting our pink...

3521
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:30,580
Oh no, don't worry.

3522
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:32,900
He's holding a porta potty.

3523
02:08:33,420 --> 02:08:34,400
He's holding it.

3524
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:36,400
Porta potty.

3525
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:38,160
He's holding the porta potty.

3526
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:40,780
I'm going to start calling it a porta potty and a house now.

3527
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:42,440
Oh my god.

3528
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:45,380
Holy shit, what the fuck?

3529
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:48,760
No, is it condom versus condom?

3530
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:50,100
There's one solo alive.

3531
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:50,880
Wait, who's the solo?

3532
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:51,820
Oh, the solo.

3533
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:54,640
There's one solo non-condom team alive.

3534
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:55,760
Let's see, wait.

3535
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:56,580
Oh, is it non-condom?

3536
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:57,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3537
02:08:57,700 --> 02:08:58,960
He literally has one.

3538
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:02,260
Wait, no, it's actually a full team.

3539
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:04,700
Yeah, they did it!

3540
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:06,200
The non-condoms won!

3541
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:07,840
They literally had zone.

3542
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:12,280
They had zone and they just built like several fucking bunkers to make their own building.

3543
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:15,300
Dang, was that three games out of five?

3544
02:09:15,620 --> 02:09:17,100
That like they're all non-condoms?

3545
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:20,240
Yeah, they're all non-condoms.

3546
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:24,460
I mean, they still have a small-ass hitbox because they're playing like the girl skins.

3547
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:27,720
But maybe our next team should be the girls.

3548
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:29,920
Yeah, what skin do you want to run?

3549
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:30,420
Okay, wait.

3550
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,100
What girl skins do we have?

3551
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,020
I don't think I have any.

3552
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:35,480
Wait, really?

3553
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:36,440
I don't think so.

3554
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,440
I think all my skins are guys.

3555
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:41,020
Wait, do you have any like furry character skins?

3556
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:42,120
Let's see.

3557
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:44,400
Wait, I have a girl.

3558
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:45,980
I have Evie.

3559
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:47,820
Oh, I have her, Adria.

3560
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:49,440
And then...

3561
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:49,920
Wait, put it on.

3562
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:50,680
I don't fucking know.

3563
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:52,400
Like, I don't know what this is from.

3564
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:54,400
Oh!

3565
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:56,240
I don't know what it is.

3566
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:58,620
I have the 2.0.

3567
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:01,360
She's from the very first season of Zero Build, I think.

3568
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:01,820
Oh!

3569
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:09,360
It's like when I re-installed Fortnite because I literally did not play Fortnite until Zero Build came out.

3570
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:11,320
And then like I played it for a little bit.

3571
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:13,820
And I was like, alright, there's tanks in this game.

3572
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:14,300
I'm good.

3573
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:15,180
I went back to Apex.

3574
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:19,700
Oh, you have Oscar.

3575
02:10:19,860 --> 02:10:20,840
I have Oscar.

3576
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:26,980
Wait, if you're going to be Oscar, should I be the shark?

3577
02:10:26,980 --> 02:10:28,360
Wait, the shark?

3578
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:33,280
This is ZZZ.

3579
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:38,740
Or should I also be a different variant of Oscar?

3580
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:42,260
This is doking.

3581
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:46,480
I could be, um...

3582
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,800
Oh, where's the other one?

3583
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:50,520
Oh my god!

3584
02:10:58,370 --> 02:11:00,170
Is this a squad?

3585
02:11:00,330 --> 02:11:00,850
Is this it?

3586
02:11:00,850 --> 02:11:03,210
Oh my god, what the fuck?

3587
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:06,750
Our fucking hitbox is so bad.

3588
02:11:08,610 --> 02:11:09,590
I don't know.

3589
02:11:09,630 --> 02:11:11,350
I don't know about our hitbox, though.

3590
02:11:11,850 --> 02:11:13,890
I'm worried about our hitbox.

3591
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:16,230
Alright, do you want to be the...

3592
02:11:16,230 --> 02:11:18,130
I have tomato, boy!

3593
02:11:18,190 --> 02:11:18,930
I have a classic!

3594
02:11:19,710 --> 02:11:20,550
Oh, be food!

3595
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:21,170
Be food!

3596
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:21,990
I have tomato head!

3597
02:11:22,410 --> 02:11:23,950
I can be a food skin, too.

3598
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:24,990
Oh my god!

3599
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:27,070
Here, let me swap.

3600
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:27,750
Let me swap mine.

3601
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:31,390
Oh my god, okay.

3602
02:11:31,570 --> 02:11:34,170
I wanna... I'm gonna be food.

3603
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:37,350
I'm gonna be food.

3604
02:11:38,670 --> 02:11:39,430
Yes!

3605
02:11:40,230 --> 02:11:41,830
Wait, that's so good!

3606
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:46,670
Oh my god!

3607
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:48,230
Wait, this is so good!

3608
02:11:50,230 --> 02:11:51,950
Tomato and corn!

3609
02:11:57,750 --> 02:11:58,950
The perfect duo.

3610
02:12:00,670 --> 02:12:01,790
Where's my gritty?

3611
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:02,570
Yeah!

3612
02:12:03,210 --> 02:12:04,150
Let's go!

3613
02:12:05,230 --> 02:12:06,830
Team tomato and corn!

3614
02:12:07,870 --> 02:12:08,290
Yeah!

3615
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:13,650
Eat your veggies!

3616
02:12:14,670 --> 02:12:15,590
Eat your vegetables!

3617
02:12:15,910 --> 02:12:17,910
Eat your vegetables, guys!

3618
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:20,050
Now I wish I had more Fortnite skins.

3619
02:12:21,850 --> 02:12:26,670
Now that I have two days of Fortnite, I wish I had more Fortnite skins.

3620
02:12:27,030 --> 02:12:29,890
I'm about to literally just give to you some random ass cursed skins.

3621
02:12:30,170 --> 02:12:31,510
Now that we have each other added.

3622
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:33,770
Oh my god!

3623
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:38,190
Wait, I remember there's like this funky ass emote with these guys, isn't there?

3624
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:39,350
You have it?

3625
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:41,850
Oh yeah, you're talking about the one from the Battle Pass, right?

3626
02:12:42,190 --> 02:12:42,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3627
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:44,690
I saw it on Twitter.

3628
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:46,270
Oh, where is it?

3629
02:12:46,370 --> 02:12:46,530
Where is it?

3630
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:46,930
You have it?

3631
02:12:46,930 --> 02:12:47,750
I can't remember what it's called.

3632
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:48,790
I do have it unlocked, yeah.

3633
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:51,150
Is it this one?

3634
02:12:51,870 --> 02:12:52,390
Yeah, here it is.

3635
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:53,610
We're team veggies.

3636
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:54,770
I quit this one.

3637
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:55,950
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3638
02:12:55,950 --> 02:12:57,470
It's this one.

3639
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:08,620
Yeah, I saw that.

3640
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:11,440
I saw that funky emote.

3641
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:12,480
I was like, what the fuck?

3642
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:16,720
Oh, did they have the code out yet?

3643
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:19,060
Yeah, they just posted it.

3644
02:13:19,180 --> 02:13:22,540
Okay, I was going to say, it would be funny if we missed it again.

3645
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:23,860
Alright, we're good.

3646
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:24,400
We're good.

3647
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:25,180
Alright, going radio.

3648
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:26,420
Nice.

3649
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:31,520
Wait, what are you using for your pickaxe?

3650
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:33,360
I'm using the poultry pummelers.

3651
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:35,500
Oh, the poultry pummelers.

3652
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:36,600
I'm going to beat them up with meat.

3653
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:38,500
Oh, is that the one that's in the shop right now?

3654
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:41,300
I don't think so.

3655
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:42,180
I don't see it in the shop.

3656
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:44,780
I bought it before for the Peter Griffin skin.

3657
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:47,140
I have drumsticks.

3658
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3659
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:50,920
That's perfect.

3660
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:52,900
Okay, I'm doing that one then.

3661
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:55,280
And then, what's my glider going to be?

3662
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:01,010
Oh, wait, I have the ice cream sandwiches.

3663
02:14:01,410 --> 02:14:02,270
The ice cream sandwiches?

3664
02:14:04,330 --> 02:14:07,290
My gliders are like... I don't have a lot of gliders.

3665
02:14:07,570 --> 02:14:08,850
Not a lot of cool ones.

3666
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:11,010
I have a lot of battle pass ones.

3667
02:14:11,530 --> 02:14:15,350
My only cool one is literally Shenron.

3668
02:14:16,370 --> 02:14:18,090
That's literally the only cool one I have.

3669
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:18,290
Wait, really?

3670
02:14:18,790 --> 02:14:19,650
I have a car.

3671
02:14:19,870 --> 02:14:20,650
I like that one.

3672
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:21,430
I have a car.

3673
02:14:21,770 --> 02:14:23,230
Wait, you have a car?

3674
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:23,770
You have Regalia?

3675
02:14:24,050 --> 02:14:25,510
No, I have Victory Vaunter.

3676
02:14:26,230 --> 02:14:29,270
I also have the Woolly Mammoth, the monster truck.

3677
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:31,270
Oh, do I have that one?

3678
02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:33,310
The Woolly Mammoth?

3679
02:14:33,410 --> 02:14:35,370
Oh, I have...

3680
02:14:35,370 --> 02:14:37,150
Do you have the Inflatable Horse?

3681
02:14:37,590 --> 02:14:38,770
The Inflatable Horse?

3682
02:14:38,890 --> 02:14:39,190
No.

3683
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:39,770
What?

3684
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:40,850
Yeah, I think it was like a Witcher.

3685
02:14:41,250 --> 02:14:42,590
It was like a Witcher Unlocked.

3686
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:43,570
What the fuck?

3687
02:14:43,650 --> 02:14:44,870
The Inflatable Horse?

3688
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:45,390
Yeah, I know.

3689
02:14:45,430 --> 02:14:46,590
I definitely do not have that.

3690
02:14:49,090 --> 02:14:50,470
Yeah, eat your veggies!

3691
02:14:50,470 --> 02:14:53,010
Everyone else is sweating and you two are having fun and vibing.

3692
02:14:53,230 --> 02:14:53,670
Yeah!

3693
02:14:54,050 --> 02:14:55,510
Eat your veggies, everybody!

3694
02:14:55,930 --> 02:14:59,450
Listen, Doki and I assembled literally an hour before the tournament.

3695
02:14:59,450 --> 02:15:00,730
Yeah, we were not ready.

3696
02:15:01,250 --> 02:15:02,270
We are vibing.

3697
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:03,070
We accept our fate.

3698
02:15:03,090 --> 02:15:06,450
Doki was like the only Fortnite player that was like free.

3699
02:15:07,950 --> 02:15:10,370
I would say we're doing pretty damn good.

3700
02:15:10,430 --> 02:15:11,450
We're doing pretty good.

3701
02:15:11,630 --> 02:15:13,290
We're better than the Overwatch duo.

3702
02:15:13,450 --> 02:15:14,430
That's all that matters.

3703
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:15,290
Let's go!

3704
02:15:15,650 --> 02:15:17,050
Wait, where's the Mercy res?

3705
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:19,570
Wait, there's a Mercy res?

3706
02:15:20,010 --> 02:15:21,610
That's what the Overwatch players are saying.

3707
02:15:21,710 --> 02:15:22,650
They're like, where's our Mercy res?

3708
02:15:23,690 --> 02:15:25,170
Where's our fucking Reinhardt shield?

3709
02:15:26,930 --> 02:15:29,410
Oh, that's so cute!

3710
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:33,270
What's the other one that's similar to that?

3711
02:15:34,330 --> 02:15:35,530
Merry Christmas!

3712
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:38,170
Merry Christmas, everybody!

3713
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:40,270
Yay!

3714
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:43,910
I mean, are you using the bathroom?

3715
02:15:44,630 --> 02:15:45,790
Yeah, how do peas pee?

3716
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:46,850
Literally.

3717
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:48,690
Do they even piss?

3718
02:15:49,030 --> 02:15:49,690
Zorro!

3719
02:15:55,470 --> 02:15:57,930
Yeah, I wish I spent more money on Fortnite.

3720
02:15:58,950 --> 02:16:01,130
You're gonna probably get random gifts from me now.

3721
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:02,990
I think I have like zero crowns.

3722
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:06,330
Look at my zero crowns, everybody!

3723
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:08,890
Yo, zero crowns?

3724
02:16:09,550 --> 02:16:09,670
Oh, I got the bird!

3725
02:16:10,250 --> 02:16:11,030
Yeah, do you have the one too?

3726
02:16:11,410 --> 02:16:12,310
Wait, no!

3727
02:16:12,530 --> 02:16:13,790
Wait, no, I didn't!

3728
02:16:13,810 --> 02:16:15,410
I didn't buy bird, it's the worst!

3729
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:17,070
No!

3730
02:16:20,390 --> 02:16:21,710
It's okay, in spirit.

3731
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:23,350
You have bird, it's the worst.

3732
02:16:23,350 --> 02:16:26,810
Yeah, you do bird is the word for me.

3733
02:16:26,990 --> 02:16:31,790
Oh, I love this one.

3734
02:16:32,430 --> 02:16:33,270
What is that?

3735
02:16:34,170 --> 02:16:36,090
He like makes it pretty hard, I think.

3736
02:16:36,950 --> 02:16:37,910
Oh no, he just sparkled.

3737
02:16:38,470 --> 02:16:39,570
Oh, there we go, he does make it hard.

3738
02:16:40,110 --> 02:16:40,170
Oh,

3739
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:44,210
this is fine.

3740
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:47,530
Wait, that's such a good emote!

3741
02:16:47,770 --> 02:16:48,430
Oh man, I wish I...

3742
02:16:48,430 --> 02:16:49,550
It's so big too.

3743
02:16:49,690 --> 02:16:50,250
Oh, I wish I bought this.

3744
02:16:50,250 --> 02:16:51,790
When you use it in game, it's ridiculous.

3745
02:16:51,790 --> 02:16:55,690
I wish I bought the Lethal Company dance one.

3746
02:16:55,710 --> 02:16:57,430
Did you buy the Lethal Company dance one?

3747
02:16:58,230 --> 02:16:59,350
Uh, yeah, do you have that one too?

3748
02:16:59,530 --> 02:17:00,530
No, I didn't!

3749
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:01,590
I wasn't on Fortnite.

3750
02:17:02,530 --> 02:17:05,970
Alright, you're gonna get gifted the next time it's in the shop.

3751
02:17:06,030 --> 02:17:07,090
Wait, what does it look like?

3752
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:10,350
Um, it's... oh, do I have it equipped yet?

3753
02:17:11,210 --> 02:17:12,010
Oh, here it is.

3754
02:17:16,750 --> 02:17:17,790
It's so good.

3755
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:23,570
I love it.

3756
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:24,990
It's so funny.

3757
02:17:26,870 --> 02:17:29,630
It's so good on, like, all the skins too.

3758
02:17:29,870 --> 02:17:31,690
I don't think it looks bad on anyone.

3759
02:17:31,890 --> 02:17:33,110
He's gonna meet the quota!

3760
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:35,210
We're gonna meet the quota, guys!

3761
02:17:35,990 --> 02:17:36,890
We're meeting the quota!

3762
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:38,130
We're not gonna be in Dead Last!

3763
02:17:38,450 --> 02:17:38,910
Yeah!

3764
02:17:41,430 --> 02:17:42,950
I think it's Macarena.

3765
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:44,810
Oh, they have Just Dance?

3766
02:17:45,410 --> 02:17:46,850
They have Just Dance?

3767
02:17:48,410 --> 02:17:49,730
Oh my god.

3768
02:17:49,730 --> 02:17:52,590
I think we just get to vibe here and just do all these emotes.

3769
02:17:52,690 --> 02:17:56,870
Yeah, everybody else is, like, fucking, like, strategizing now.

3770
02:17:57,230 --> 02:17:58,230
I know my place.

3771
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:01,810
Oh, there's Chewbacca!

3772
02:18:02,990 --> 02:18:03,910
Wait, you have Chewbacca?

3773
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:05,570
No, I can buy Chewbacca.

3774
02:18:06,670 --> 02:18:07,670
Wait, what do you have?

3775
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:09,890
Do you have, like, Han Solo?

3776
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:16,950
I think out of all the Fortnite skin collabs I have, I don't think I have any ones from Star Wars.

3777
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:19,230
You don't have... Oh, you don't have...

3778
02:18:19,230 --> 02:18:19,470
Let me see.

3779
02:18:19,830 --> 02:18:22,350
Yeah, because it's Lego, but it includes Chewbacca.

3780
02:18:22,870 --> 02:18:23,390
Oh, no, I do.

3781
02:18:23,510 --> 02:18:24,730
I have, like, Darth Vader and stuff.

3782
02:18:24,950 --> 02:18:25,190
No!

3783
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:27,270
You don't have Han Solo!

3784
02:18:27,930 --> 02:18:29,890
I have a Clone Trooper.

3785
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:32,890
I have Ahsoka.

3786
02:18:33,570 --> 02:18:34,950
And then I have...

3787
02:18:35,590 --> 02:18:37,850
No, we can't match because we don't have Han Solo.

3788
02:18:38,610 --> 02:18:38,930
No!

3789
02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:39,910
Oh, do you have Princess Leia?

3790
02:18:40,570 --> 02:18:41,330
No, I don't.

3791
02:18:41,450 --> 02:18:41,810
I don't.

3792
02:18:42,030 --> 02:18:43,990
Because you can buy Chewbacca right now.

3793
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:45,710
Oh, wait, what?

3794
02:18:46,090 --> 02:18:47,050
Oh, they added Chewbacca?

3795
02:18:47,390 --> 02:18:48,350
Yeah, they added Chewbacca.

3796
02:18:48,550 --> 02:18:50,250
You have to buy the Lego Pass, though.

3797
02:18:50,850 --> 02:18:51,890
Oh, that's where it's at.

3798
02:18:51,910 --> 02:18:52,770
Okay, it's in the Lego Pass.

3799
02:18:52,770 --> 02:18:55,090
Yeah, but you can, like, get Chewbacca regularly.

3800
02:18:56,830 --> 02:18:58,870
Oh, I forgot to put on a back bling.

3801
02:18:59,010 --> 02:18:59,410
I'm sad.

3802
02:18:59,950 --> 02:19:00,390
It's okay.

3803
02:19:00,470 --> 02:19:01,410
I'm naked on my back.

3804
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:04,250
Look at all these condom people.

3805
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:08,210
Is there any non-condom players in the lobby right now?

3806
02:19:09,130 --> 02:19:09,770
Alright, cool.

3807
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:10,730
We got our spot.

3808
02:19:11,450 --> 02:19:12,110
Oh, we're landing.

3809
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:13,210
We can actually drop right away.

3810
02:19:14,030 --> 02:19:15,270
I'm gonna do it right now.

3811
02:19:16,090 --> 02:19:16,450
Yay!

3812
02:19:17,410 --> 02:19:19,010
Alright, chat, game number six.

3813
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:20,130
Let's fucking go!

3814
02:19:20,170 --> 02:19:21,070
Wait, is it game number six?

3815
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:21,990
I thought it was game five.

3816
02:19:21,990 --> 02:19:22,150
I think so.

3817
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:22,730
I think it's game five.

3818
02:19:22,810 --> 02:19:23,230
Is it game five?

3819
02:19:23,250 --> 02:19:23,950
No, it's five.

3820
02:19:24,810 --> 02:19:25,870
Okay, game number five.

3821
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:26,310
Let's go!

3822
02:19:26,310 --> 02:19:26,770
Let's go!

3823
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:29,650
Summon the fucking dragons!

3824
02:19:35,590 --> 02:19:36,770
Slowly drifting down.

3825
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:40,900
Alright.

3826
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:41,380
Oh, nice.

3827
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:42,540
I got crash pads.

3828
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,340
Ooh, that's good.

3829
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:47,500
Alright, what's in here?

3830
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:48,540
A shotgun?

3831
02:19:49,420 --> 02:19:50,680
I got a shotgun.

3832
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:54,860
Let's see.

3833
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:55,860
They're all guns.

3834
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,520
The moment I stop being Mr. Beast, there's no more trees.

3835
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:00,580
What the hell?

3836
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:01,240
Trees?

3837
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:02,400
It's actually crazy.

3838
02:20:02,940 --> 02:20:04,220
The trees just stopped spawning.

3839
02:20:05,180 --> 02:20:06,960
I actually have zero trees.

3840
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:09,400
Well, we are the plant, I mean.

3841
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:09,960
Or the food.

3842
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:11,220
You're the vegetable.

3843
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:14,240
It actually stopped spawning.

3844
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:16,180
The game knows.

3845
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:18,580
Oh, hey, a sniper.

3846
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:23,680
I'm outside your building.

3847
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:26,400
Okay, I'm trying to see what I'm... Oh, there's one more.

3848
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:28,000
Oh, there's a tree here.

3849
02:20:28,660 --> 02:20:29,720
Oh my god, one tree!

3850
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:31,040
Yeah, one tree.

3851
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:31,800
We got one tree.

3852
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:33,420
That's all we needed.

3853
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:37,400
Oh, I got more Gibby bubbles.

3854
02:20:37,980 --> 02:20:39,100
Nice, we need that.

3855
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:42,080
I'm gonna drink my shield.

3856
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:46,340
Alright, I'm gonna see if there's any shields over here.

3857
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:47,580
Oh, we're also in zone, too.

3858
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:48,360
Yay!

3859
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:53,120
Okay, I feel like I might not be able to snipe here.

3860
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:54,920
Everybody's always close range.

3861
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:58,720
Yeah, I've been thinking about what I'm gonna run.

3862
02:20:59,060 --> 02:21:01,840
And I think I'm gonna swap up my weapon.

3863
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:03,240
I have the crash pad.

3864
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:04,320
Oh, you do?

3865
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:05,080
Oh, same, same.

3866
02:21:05,140 --> 02:21:05,400
I have six.

3867
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:08,020
Okay, I'm just grabbing stuff over here.

3868
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:08,780
I'm coming back.

3869
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:11,000
We just don't have the porta potty.

3870
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:16,360
We're just missing the... how are we gonna build a house?

3871
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:18,100
I have four Gibby bubbles.

3872
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:22,640
I have six launch pads and two shockwaves.

3873
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:24,360
Oh, sweet.

3874
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:25,000
Okay, okay.

3875
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:27,120
You're a shockwave master now.

3876
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:27,800
And trees.

3877
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:29,380
And trees?

3878
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:30,000
Okay, sweet.

3879
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:33,620
Oh, I got houses!

3880
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:35,960
We got a house?

3881
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:37,480
We can afford it!

3882
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:39,340
Alright, I'm going back to you.

3883
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:40,480
Oh my god!

3884
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:42,000
Guys!

3885
02:21:43,320 --> 02:21:44,580
We're gonna make it!

3886
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:47,820
I think we have to just chill here for a little bit.

3887
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:49,400
Oh, you know what we can also do too?

3888
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:50,360
Were there medkits here?

3889
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:53,420
Uh, there were like bandages, but not a medkit.

3890
02:21:53,860 --> 02:21:55,480
We might be able to live storm again.

3891
02:21:55,560 --> 02:21:56,580
We can do that strat.

3892
02:21:56,660 --> 02:21:57,980
Remember how that team was living forever?

3893
02:21:58,740 --> 02:21:59,940
Yeah, I'm gonna try that.

3894
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:00,520
I'm gonna try that.

3895
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:01,420
Did you grab the bandages?

3896
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:02,640
Because there was...

3897
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:04,980
No, let me check up here.

3898
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:06,520
I know I dropped some.

3899
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:11,780
We also have a lot of space to work with and we can like go all the way over there too.

3900
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:12,840
But...

3901
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:14,860
Oh, what do I drop?

3902
02:22:14,860 --> 02:22:15,540
There's a butt?

3903
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:17,340
Do you wanna...

3904
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:19,500
Butts?

3905
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:19,900
Ayo?

3906
02:22:21,880 --> 02:22:24,580
Do you wanna build houses or do you wanna make Gibby bubbles?

3907
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:27,960
I feel like the house is stronger.

3908
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:35,300
When I saw like 200,000 houses and like two Gibby bubbles, I feel like people were running houses more.

3909
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:38,680
I'm gonna drop the houses and I'm gonna try to find some heals.

3910
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:41,380
Because we also have to move too.

3911
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:42,960
But we can also move with storm.

3912
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:43,940
We're gonna like eat storm.

3913
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:47,120
Because it's pretty far.

3914
02:22:47,380 --> 02:22:49,260
Wait, you're not gonna pick up the bunker?

3915
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:51,680
Oh yeah, I can pick it up for now.

3916
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:54,880
Yeah, because like I'm gonna try to find us medkits and heals.

3917
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:56,500
But we're gonna go slow with storm.

3918
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:57,360
We're gonna go at like 10 seconds.

3919
02:23:01,880 --> 02:23:04,920
I don't think that team's gonna come over from...

3920
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:06,780
Where we've died before.

3921
02:23:07,820 --> 02:23:11,780
Knowing them, I think they're gonna rotate like all the way in the south, so I think...

3922
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:15,060
Yeah, we're gonna try to go back to looping.

3923
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:16,640
Alright, let's start going.

3924
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:18,060
Alright, let's go.

3925
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:19,340
Team Veggies!

3926
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,780
I see a team on the island, but we're gonna go with storm.

3927
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:24,660
Team Veggies!

3928
02:23:27,380 --> 02:23:28,180
Okay, let's...

3929
02:23:28,180 --> 02:23:29,060
Oh, there's a team on the right.

3930
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:29,900
Crouch, crouch.

3931
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:32,260
We're gonna chill here.

3932
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:35,020
Please leave us alone.

3933
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:36,640
We're just poor little veggies.

3934
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:40,160
We're trying to save the environment.

3935
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:44,340
I also have a lot of jump pads, so that way we can keep rotating.

3936
02:23:44,620 --> 02:23:45,600
Not last.

3937
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:46,560
Yay!

3938
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:51,660
It's all that matters.

3939
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:55,700
How much gold do I have?

3940
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:56,520
I only got 9 gold?

3941
02:23:57,760 --> 02:23:59,180
I have 9 as well.

3942
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:01,860
Okay, let's go in this bush here.

3943
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:02,400
Come up here.

3944
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:05,620
We're gonna look around.

3945
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:07,040
Oh yeah, there's definitely still a team on the island.

3946
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:07,620
So this is good.

3947
02:24:08,420 --> 02:24:09,900
I don't have any meds.

3948
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,860
We're gonna find meds to the left.

3949
02:24:12,900 --> 02:24:14,540
We're gonna go all the way over here.

3950
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:15,560
What if we don't?

3951
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:17,460
If we don't?

3952
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:18,340
GG.

3953
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:22,440
It's because your plan relies very heavily on the meds part.

3954
02:24:23,860 --> 02:24:25,220
This guy is also healing.

3955
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:27,320
I think we're good.

3956
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:28,180
Okay, let's go left.

3957
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,240
I'm a little concerned because...

3958
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:36,800
I'm pretty sure I did find meds here earlier.

3959
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:37,100
I fell down.

3960
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:38,380
Oh, you fell?

3961
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:39,260
Oh, here.

3962
02:24:39,300 --> 02:24:39,820
I got a crash pad.

3963
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:40,340
Here you go.

3964
02:24:41,660 --> 02:24:43,340
I think that should work?

3965
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:45,160
Does it work?

3966
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:46,260
Goodbye.

3967
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:47,760
Oh, here.

3968
02:24:47,860 --> 02:24:48,500
I'll toss you a med kit.

3969
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:49,020
I'm gonna toss you a med kit.

3970
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:49,340
Goodbye.

3971
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:50,280
Hello.

3972
02:24:51,320 --> 02:24:51,680
Yay!

3973
02:24:55,460 --> 02:24:56,860
Wait, do you have any heals though?

3974
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:58,880
No, I can find something though.

3975
02:24:58,920 --> 02:24:59,460
I'll find something.

3976
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:05,240
There is a bunch of chests up here.

3977
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:06,840
Oh, I got splashes.

3978
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:07,300
Yeah, we're good.

3979
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:07,760
Nice!

3980
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:08,680
I'm gonna light a campfire.

3981
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:13,850
And then I got more splashes.

3982
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:15,010
Oh, there's more bandages.

3983
02:25:15,470 --> 02:25:17,810
Alright, so I'm gonna splash us once this thing goes out.

3984
02:25:17,930 --> 02:25:18,150
Alright.

3985
02:25:19,070 --> 02:25:21,130
Because if I splash us now, it goes away.

3986
02:25:21,710 --> 02:25:22,190
Oh no.

3987
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:24,590
We can live here forever.

3988
02:25:25,490 --> 02:25:27,270
This is our new home now.

3989
02:25:28,230 --> 02:25:31,650
We're drinking some grape juice.

3990
02:25:37,310 --> 02:25:38,350
There's nobody here.

3991
02:25:38,470 --> 02:25:39,130
I can even...

3992
02:25:41,110 --> 02:25:42,150
Oh, what the fuck?

3993
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:43,310
I cracked him.

3994
02:25:43,650 --> 02:25:44,130
I knocked him.

3995
02:25:44,790 --> 02:25:45,410
I knocked him.

3996
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:45,830
I knocked him.

3997
02:25:45,930 --> 02:25:46,030
I knocked him.

3998
02:25:46,770 --> 02:25:47,670
Okay, I'm gonna push.

3999
02:25:47,730 --> 02:25:48,190
I'm gonna push that.

4000
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:49,030
Oh, he died.

4001
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:49,310
He died.

4002
02:25:49,510 --> 02:25:50,070
Okay, let's go left.

4003
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:50,450
Let's go left.

4004
02:25:50,450 --> 02:25:50,910
Let's go left.

4005
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:08,870
That was actually so fucking terrifying.

4006
02:26:09,110 --> 02:26:11,870
I was literally... I was literally trying to jam out.

4007
02:26:15,210 --> 02:26:16,510
Holy shit.

4008
02:26:17,070 --> 02:26:18,030
Oh my god.

4009
02:26:18,030 --> 02:26:20,050
Oh my god, Jokey.

4010
02:26:20,070 --> 02:26:21,470
That was fucking terrifying.

4011
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:22,510
That was so funny.

4012
02:26:22,610 --> 02:26:23,070
Holy shit.

4013
02:26:23,930 --> 02:26:26,970
At that moment, I was like, there's nobody here.

4014
02:26:27,210 --> 02:26:30,510
Finally, Emo and I see a guy next to me.

4015
02:26:30,510 --> 02:26:33,930
I was chilling and Emo and this dude's running up like, yo, word?

4016
02:26:36,590 --> 02:26:38,090
I think we're good here.

4017
02:26:38,170 --> 02:26:38,970
I think we're good here.

4018
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:39,510
I think.

4019
02:26:39,690 --> 02:26:41,070
There's a bunch of where I want us to get to.

4020
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:43,270
Okay, I'm trying to head there.

4021
02:26:43,370 --> 02:26:44,190
I don't know if I can...

4022
02:26:44,190 --> 02:26:45,370
Oh, I fucking have a crown.

4023
02:26:45,450 --> 02:26:46,070
I'm so dumb.

4024
02:26:46,490 --> 02:26:47,450
Oh my god, again.

4025
02:26:48,110 --> 02:26:49,970
It keeps on respawning on us.

4026
02:26:50,070 --> 02:26:51,610
Yeah, you have to... what's the word?

4027
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:52,870
You have to drop it, right?

4028
02:26:53,430 --> 02:26:55,650
Yeah, if I drop it, though, people are going to see it on the map.

4029
02:26:55,710 --> 02:26:56,950
So, I'm just going to chill here.

4030
02:26:57,710 --> 02:26:58,430
Okay, I'm good.

4031
02:26:58,490 --> 02:26:58,810
I'm good here.

4032
02:27:00,530 --> 02:27:02,910
I'm going to look around for heals.

4033
02:27:03,890 --> 02:27:04,870
I'm in the bush.

4034
02:27:05,510 --> 02:27:07,930
I feel like there's going to be a team on top of the tower here.

4035
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:09,490
Not if I'm in the bush.

4036
02:27:14,890 --> 02:27:15,530
I'm terrified.

4037
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:17,190
I don't know if there's heals here.

4038
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:18,830
I'm so scared.

4039
02:27:18,830 --> 02:27:22,270
Dude, this bug FPS died like four times.

4040
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:26,390
It wasn't... I didn't see him die like four times in this game.

4041
02:27:26,670 --> 02:27:29,350
Okay, Doki, I'm going to try... we have to move forward.

4042
02:27:29,770 --> 02:27:31,710
So, we can try to get over here.

4043
02:27:32,070 --> 02:27:34,750
Or we can get to here and build a house together.

4044
02:27:35,170 --> 02:27:36,710
Okay, I believe in the house stack.

4045
02:27:36,730 --> 02:27:37,170
I'm going to go.

4046
02:27:37,290 --> 02:27:37,570
I'm going to go.

4047
02:27:37,590 --> 02:27:40,790
I'm going to actually burn a bubble on this because I need to see if there's heals on here.

4048
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:45,460
Heals?

4049
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:47,500
There's no heals.

4050
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:47,740
Oh no.

4051
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:48,820
Oh no.

4052
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:51,580
Okay, I'm going to your bush.

4053
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:56,000
Trying to ping what's in.

4054
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:58,740
Someone is getting closer.

4055
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:01,660
I see the blueberry juice coming in.

4056
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:02,500
Let's go to this bush.

4057
02:28:02,620 --> 02:28:03,120
Let's go to this bush.

4058
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:06,920
Oh no.

4059
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:07,740
Oh no.

4060
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:10,060
There you go.

4061
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:11,520
We're good.

4062
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:12,740
I'm looking.

4063
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:13,720
Wait, where did they shoot you from?

4064
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:14,460
Over here?

4065
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:17,460
I'm going to go behind.

4066
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:19,280
I'm okay.

4067
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:20,840
Oh, are they in the bush?

4068
02:28:20,980 --> 02:28:22,220
I think they might be in the bush over here.

4069
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:24,160
Where is here?

4070
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:26,700
Let me see if I can ping it.

4071
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:28,500
Right there, I think?

4072
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:29,740
Oh my god.

4073
02:28:30,060 --> 02:28:30,720
Oh my god.

4074
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:31,260
There they are.

4075
02:28:31,300 --> 02:28:31,660
There they are.

4076
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:35,660
Where are they?

4077
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:37,960
I'm going to... they're like hiding in there.

4078
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,320
In that bush in front of us?

4079
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:40,740
Yeah, they're literally in that bush.

4080
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:43,160
What the fuck is wrong with them?

4081
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:46,600
Wait, where did you go?

4082
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:47,940
I'm behind you.

4083
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:48,380
I'm behind you.

4084
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:49,780
Oh, there you are.

4085
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:53,500
Okay, we can keep... Oh, actually, Goki, I have an idea.

4086
02:28:53,780 --> 02:28:54,420
Here, run back to me.

4087
02:28:54,780 --> 02:28:55,060
Yeah?

4088
02:28:55,300 --> 02:28:57,420
And we're going to cut all the way to this on that.

4089
02:28:57,900 --> 02:28:58,220
Okay?

4090
02:28:58,300 --> 02:28:59,560
I'm going to toss a little jump pad.

4091
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4092
02:29:00,180 --> 02:29:01,480
Get ready and let's go.

4093
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:03,060
Oh, I'm being fucking bugged!

4094
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:03,660
You missed it!

4095
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:04,320
You missed it!

4096
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:05,780
No, it's bugging me.

4097
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:06,640
It's bugging me.

4098
02:29:06,740 --> 02:29:07,320
Okay, just keep going.

4099
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:07,600
Keep going.

4100
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:07,860
Keep going.

4101
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:08,140
Keep going.

4102
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:09,360
There we go.

4103
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:10,360
Oh my god.

4104
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:12,780
This game...

4105
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:14,340
This game...

4106
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:17,180
I'm going... Oh my god, it's bugging again.

4107
02:29:17,300 --> 02:29:18,520
I hate it here, dude.

4108
02:29:20,260 --> 02:29:20,920
I'm okay.

4109
02:29:21,160 --> 02:29:22,000
I feel safe.

4110
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:22,800
Oh, I see them.

4111
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,180
I see them.

4112
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:23,640
I'm okay.

4113
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:24,020
I'm okay.

4114
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:26,000
I found bandages.

4115
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:26,320
I'm here.

4116
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:27,060
I'm here.

4117
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:27,940
I found bandages.

4118
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:29,440
I'm going to toss this down.

4119
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:31,900
It's okay.

4120
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:32,380
I'm here.

4121
02:29:34,140 --> 02:29:36,520
I launched pad like two times to get here.

4122
02:29:37,740 --> 02:29:39,060
Alright, we're covered on both sides.

4123
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:39,400
We're good.

4124
02:29:39,460 --> 02:29:39,640
We're good.

4125
02:29:39,660 --> 02:29:39,980
Okay.

4126
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:42,500
I feel safer.

4127
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:47,880
I'm just watching the other team behind us.

4128
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:50,240
Holy shit.

4129
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:53,380
Where's this RPG coming from?

4130
02:29:54,220 --> 02:29:55,140
Wait, is someone RPGing?

4131
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:56,080
Yeah.

4132
02:29:56,620 --> 02:29:57,820
Oh, I think I know where.

4133
02:29:57,940 --> 02:29:58,800
It's... I'll ping it.

4134
02:29:59,120 --> 02:29:59,920
I think it's right there.

4135
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:03,560
I hear like...

4136
02:30:04,580 --> 02:30:08,060
Doki, if we get pushed, I'm going to immediately just shield bubble.

4137
02:30:08,060 --> 02:30:09,600
I'm going to give you bubble.

4138
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:10,600
Okay, okay.

4139
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:13,420
Should I come to you or be in this house?

4140
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:13,780
No, no.

4141
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:14,560
You're good on that side.

4142
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:15,060
You're good on that side.

4143
02:30:17,180 --> 02:30:17,520
Alright.

4144
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:18,880
Oh, that's you.

4145
02:30:19,080 --> 02:30:20,000
Okay, I was like, who's that?

4146
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:23,000
Yeah, I see a team that's fighting over here.

4147
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:25,920
Wait, there's like a shield potion right in front of me.

4148
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:26,940
Oh, there is?

4149
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:27,540
Oh, that's good.

4150
02:30:27,880 --> 02:30:28,280
Okay, yeah.

4151
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:28,920
You can pop that then.

4152
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:30,060
I'm going to...

4153
02:30:33,390 --> 02:30:33,730
Yay!

4154
02:30:35,370 --> 02:30:36,830
I should probably not peek that.

4155
02:30:39,530 --> 02:30:42,630
They're fighting to our side?

4156
02:30:44,110 --> 02:30:45,330
I don't have an angle.

4157
02:30:47,110 --> 02:30:50,010
You can feel free to shoot whoever just so that way we have presence.

4158
02:30:50,290 --> 02:30:50,570
What's that sound?

4159
02:30:52,030 --> 02:30:53,910
Oh, that's people responding, I think.

4160
02:30:54,150 --> 02:30:54,510
Oh!

4161
02:30:55,050 --> 02:30:56,110
Oh, the respawn is ending.

4162
02:30:56,230 --> 02:30:57,350
Okay, I was like, what the fuck?

4163
02:30:57,350 --> 02:30:58,710
Oh, we're good here.

4164
02:30:58,850 --> 02:30:59,650
We're literally chilling.

4165
02:30:59,750 --> 02:30:59,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4166
02:30:59,850 --> 02:31:01,510
I feel a little safer now.

4167
02:31:01,530 --> 02:31:02,330
We're chilling.

4168
02:31:03,030 --> 02:31:04,170
Oh, there's people in front of us.

4169
02:31:05,010 --> 02:31:06,190
Oops, I shot my house.

4170
02:31:09,730 --> 02:31:10,790
Oh, I hit that.

4171
02:31:11,550 --> 02:31:13,390
I randomly griefed this guy.

4172
02:31:14,190 --> 02:31:15,350
77 on someone?

4173
02:31:16,010 --> 02:31:17,970
Don't you love just griefing people in VR?

4174
02:31:20,930 --> 02:31:22,110
Is it safe for me to go up here?

4175
02:31:22,130 --> 02:31:22,550
I'm terrified.

4176
02:31:22,650 --> 02:31:23,410
I could get shot from there.

4177
02:31:23,490 --> 02:31:24,830
Yeah, I know.

4178
02:31:24,950 --> 02:31:25,850
It's so terrifying.

4179
02:31:27,430 --> 02:31:28,470
Can I peek this?

4180
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:31,990
I can't even peek on the right.

4181
02:31:33,290 --> 02:31:34,910
There's so many gunshots.

4182
02:31:38,110 --> 02:31:39,990
Come on, come out of that house!

4183
02:31:40,310 --> 02:31:44,150
If this bunker is safe, I'm going to...

4184
02:31:44,150 --> 02:31:45,090
Oh, yeah, there were people here.

4185
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:48,230
There's people going to be right here on the left.

4186
02:31:48,570 --> 02:31:48,770
Okay.

4187
02:31:50,270 --> 02:31:51,770
I don't have an angle on that.

4188
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:52,830
Yeah, you're good.

4189
02:31:52,890 --> 02:31:53,150
You're good.

4190
02:31:53,350 --> 02:31:55,070
Yeah, the only thing is, she was in front of me.

4191
02:31:55,530 --> 02:31:56,790
And a little bit to the left.

4192
02:31:57,510 --> 02:32:01,730
If you get shot at, I can throw the bubble down where it can connect on your side of the building.

4193
02:32:02,130 --> 02:32:02,490
Yeah.

4194
02:32:03,130 --> 02:32:04,330
I think I'm fine for now.

4195
02:32:04,330 --> 02:32:05,490
Like, I still have this house.

4196
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:06,230
Yeah.

4197
02:32:07,130 --> 02:32:08,490
Yeah, we made this house.

4198
02:32:08,570 --> 02:32:08,830
Yeah.

4199
02:32:09,170 --> 02:32:09,470
This bar house.

4200
02:32:10,070 --> 02:32:11,230
Oh, they're coming out of the house.

4201
02:32:11,370 --> 02:32:12,130
Oh, wait, never mind.

4202
02:32:12,590 --> 02:32:14,410
Okay, so we are going to have to move.

4203
02:32:16,030 --> 02:32:16,470
But...

4204
02:32:16,470 --> 02:32:16,810
Okay.

4205
02:32:17,370 --> 02:32:19,250
I have one house I can build.

4206
02:32:21,270 --> 02:32:21,710
Alright.

4207
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:23,490
We can try to get over here.

4208
02:32:23,950 --> 02:32:26,390
I feel confident with that one house.

4209
02:32:28,550 --> 02:32:30,570
Actually, Doki, come to this side of the house.

4210
02:32:31,030 --> 02:32:34,630
Because I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a launch pad.

4211
02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:39,750
Wait, you can come inside the door.

4212
02:32:40,710 --> 02:32:41,830
No, I'm going to die from this.

4213
02:32:42,210 --> 02:32:42,450
No, I'm here.

4214
02:32:43,130 --> 02:32:43,270
No, no.

4215
02:32:43,830 --> 02:32:44,670
What the fuck?

4216
02:32:44,710 --> 02:32:45,970
What the fuck, Doki?

4217
02:32:46,230 --> 02:32:49,250
You didn't tell me I could open the door.

4218
02:32:50,030 --> 02:32:50,750
I can't.

4219
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:51,550
Okay, we're going to have to go.

4220
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:53,950
No, we're going to go.

4221
02:32:54,210 --> 02:32:55,390
I'm going to die.

4222
02:32:55,470 --> 02:32:56,210
Yeah, I'm dying.

4223
02:32:56,210 --> 02:32:57,110
No, you're going to live.

4224
02:32:57,230 --> 02:32:57,650
You're going to live.

4225
02:32:59,290 --> 02:32:59,790
Oh, you're good.

4226
02:32:59,850 --> 02:33:00,090
You're good.

4227
02:33:01,410 --> 02:33:02,010
I got you.

4228
02:33:02,030 --> 02:33:02,310
I got you.

4229
02:33:02,390 --> 02:33:02,630
I got you.

4230
02:33:04,250 --> 02:33:05,130
I got you.

4231
02:33:05,210 --> 02:33:05,450
I got you.

4232
02:33:05,530 --> 02:33:05,870
I got you.

4233
02:33:05,970 --> 02:33:06,330
I got you.

4234
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:06,370
I got you.

4235
02:33:06,390 --> 02:33:09,310
Why didn't you tell me that the door...

4236
02:33:09,810 --> 02:33:10,910
Alright, so this might be a GG.

4237
02:33:11,130 --> 02:33:11,610
I'm dead.

4238
02:33:15,770 --> 02:33:17,250
You said go over.

4239
02:33:17,370 --> 02:33:18,210
I was like, okay.

4240
02:33:18,490 --> 02:33:19,350
I think that's a dead climb.

4241
02:33:19,610 --> 02:33:21,690
There was a door on the other side.

4242
02:33:22,490 --> 02:33:24,470
I can't tell there was a door.

4243
02:33:27,770 --> 02:33:29,690
I got so confused.

4244
02:33:30,470 --> 02:33:32,550
No, you can't climb.

4245
02:33:37,110 --> 02:33:38,890
Oh my god.

4246
02:33:40,310 --> 02:33:42,770
No, you can't climb.

4247
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:46,170
All I heard was go over.

4248
02:33:46,410 --> 02:33:47,770
I was like, okay.

4249
02:33:51,950 --> 02:33:54,330
You mean there was a door?

4250
02:33:54,330 --> 02:33:57,330
Oh my god.

4251
02:33:59,830 --> 02:34:09,730
I think my favorite part about that whole scenario is that you could have literally walked inside safely to the other side and you weren't around.

4252
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:11,030
I thought that.

4253
02:34:11,370 --> 02:34:12,530
You said go over.

4254
02:34:13,430 --> 02:34:14,990
Oh my god.

4255
02:34:15,230 --> 02:34:16,910
I said go over.

4256
02:34:19,530 --> 02:34:21,770
Oh my god.

4257
02:34:24,330 --> 02:34:25,450
Oh my god.

4258
02:34:25,530 --> 02:34:26,850
I'm fucking crying right now.

4259
02:34:26,930 --> 02:34:28,170
That was so funny.

4260
02:34:28,830 --> 02:34:30,950
I can't see the door.

4261
02:34:36,370 --> 02:34:38,290
Oh my god.

4262
02:34:39,590 --> 02:34:41,890
I got so scared.

4263
02:34:46,830 --> 02:34:48,950
Oh my god.

4264
02:34:49,330 --> 02:34:50,390
Guys, we got a kill.

4265
02:34:51,050 --> 02:34:53,090
Guys, that's all that matters.

4266
02:34:54,550 --> 02:34:56,250
We got one kill.

4267
02:34:56,250 --> 02:34:57,250
We ended on 50.

4268
02:34:57,370 --> 02:34:57,630
You know what?

4269
02:34:57,670 --> 02:34:58,150
No, no, doggie.

4270
02:34:58,230 --> 02:34:59,750
We have consistency, okay?

4271
02:34:59,750 --> 02:35:01,250
You know these things don't have?

4272
02:35:01,330 --> 02:35:02,530
They don't have consistency.

4273
02:35:03,130 --> 02:35:03,610
Exactly.

4274
02:35:04,230 --> 02:35:05,390
We're never last.

4275
02:35:05,470 --> 02:35:07,890
They're not ending on the same number as we are.

4276
02:35:08,030 --> 02:35:09,310
Every single round.

4277
02:35:11,070 --> 02:35:13,050
We're 15th place Andes.

4278
02:35:15,270 --> 02:35:16,890
Oh my god.

4279
02:35:17,110 --> 02:35:19,330
Oh my god, the houses are real.

4280
02:35:19,350 --> 02:35:23,410
I swear, we died to the Christmas theme so many times.

4281
02:35:23,410 --> 02:35:26,710
They want to wish us Merry Christmas in July.

4282
02:35:26,730 --> 02:35:27,770
Why are they always next to us?

4283
02:35:30,330 --> 02:35:31,210
I swear, it's like they know.

4284
02:35:31,330 --> 02:35:35,410
They're like, look, these guys are the different people who keep on becoming other skins.

4285
02:35:35,570 --> 02:35:37,390
Yeah, they know.

4286
02:35:38,270 --> 02:35:39,870
They fucking know.

4287
02:35:41,090 --> 02:35:42,950
That was the fucking best one up, Joe.

4288
02:35:42,970 --> 02:35:43,970
They know that's us.

4289
02:35:47,790 --> 02:35:49,630
Holy shit, they figured out our tracks.

4290
02:35:49,650 --> 02:35:50,130
I'm literally crying.

4291
02:35:50,370 --> 02:35:52,150
My cheeks hurt from laughing.

4292
02:35:52,310 --> 02:35:53,710
That was so fucking funny.

4293
02:35:53,710 --> 02:35:56,530
I don't know what it looked like on their stream.

4294
02:35:58,070 --> 02:36:00,910
They tried to climb the house and get knocked off.

4295
02:36:01,590 --> 02:36:02,590
Wait, are they alive still?

4296
02:36:02,910 --> 02:36:03,850
Are the Christmas people alive?

4297
02:36:03,870 --> 02:36:04,990
Yeah, they're still alive.

4298
02:36:05,450 --> 02:36:06,330
Wait, who was it?

4299
02:36:06,510 --> 02:36:07,850
I don't know, they're anonymous.

4300
02:36:07,870 --> 02:36:08,450
They're anonymous.

4301
02:36:08,510 --> 02:36:09,510
Yeah, we don't know.

4302
02:36:11,110 --> 02:36:12,330
Oh my god.

4303
02:36:12,410 --> 02:36:14,430
I want to watch their POVs so bad.

4304
02:36:14,510 --> 02:36:17,170
They're going to be like, why is this guy running outside?

4305
02:36:17,990 --> 02:36:20,370
I didn't know there was a door.

4306
02:36:20,370 --> 02:36:22,370
I don't know.

4307
02:36:23,630 --> 02:36:25,110
Wait, what the fuck?

4308
02:36:25,170 --> 02:36:26,490
He threw a trophy at us.

4309
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:27,590
What the fuck?

4310
02:36:28,030 --> 02:36:29,850
Oh my god, they died in one second.

4311
02:36:30,110 --> 02:36:32,710
I like, fucking closed my eyes and they're dead.

4312
02:36:33,470 --> 02:36:37,130
That is some OG ass thing I've never ever seen.

4313
02:36:37,170 --> 02:36:37,750
What the fuck?

4314
02:36:37,750 --> 02:36:38,430
What is that?

4315
02:36:38,970 --> 02:36:40,330
What are they holding?

4316
02:36:42,430 --> 02:36:43,470
What is that?

4317
02:36:44,010 --> 02:36:46,670
They're holding a giant, like, a giant trophy.

4318
02:36:47,070 --> 02:36:47,610
What the fuck?

4319
02:36:47,610 --> 02:36:48,430
And then they, like, throw it?

4320
02:36:49,170 --> 02:36:50,890
I've never seen this before.

4321
02:36:51,010 --> 02:36:52,410
That's how, like, not OG I am.

4322
02:36:53,310 --> 02:36:56,210
What are they doing with the trophy?

4323
02:36:57,270 --> 02:36:58,490
I think it one-shots.

4324
02:36:59,990 --> 02:37:03,530
Oh, it does 200 damage in one hit.

4325
02:37:04,030 --> 02:37:04,770
What the fuck?

4326
02:37:04,790 --> 02:37:05,950
How did you get the trophy?

4327
02:37:06,750 --> 02:37:08,870
Fuck, FPS is still alive?

4328
02:37:09,590 --> 02:37:14,810
This man has died, like, this is the fifth time I see him died on the kill feed.

4329
02:37:15,250 --> 02:37:17,030
How is he still alive?

4330
02:37:19,270 --> 02:37:21,610
I want to watch this guy get a kill with this.

4331
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:29,830
Are they just, like, is Buck FPS just landing on somebody and just his other duo is just, like, waiting until, like, he respawns?

4332
02:37:29,890 --> 02:37:31,330
Like, what's the strat?

4333
02:37:32,150 --> 02:37:33,130
He's coming back.

4334
02:37:33,690 --> 02:37:34,490
Oh, is this guy gonna live?

4335
02:37:34,690 --> 02:37:37,330
I want to see him throw the freaking fish at someone, even though it's a quantum skip.

4336
02:37:37,330 --> 02:37:38,570
Wait, that's so risky.

4337
02:37:39,050 --> 02:37:40,350
Like, yeah, he's so dead.

4338
02:37:40,370 --> 02:37:40,930
Just throw it now.

4339
02:37:41,170 --> 02:37:41,310
Oh, he's dead.

4340
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:41,830
He's dead.

4341
02:37:41,890 --> 02:37:43,790
No, you guys threw it out of the hell, man!

4342
02:37:44,110 --> 02:37:44,490
No!

4343
02:37:44,830 --> 02:37:45,930
You could've thrown it!

4344
02:37:47,170 --> 02:37:47,810
You're dead already.

4345
02:37:47,810 --> 02:37:49,310
He was gonna die anyway!

4346
02:37:50,530 --> 02:37:56,030
Oh my god, thank god, thank god.

4347
02:37:56,030 --> 02:37:56,730
Let's go!

4348
02:37:56,810 --> 02:38:00,750
Only one cotton team has won throughout this tournament.

4349
02:38:02,430 --> 02:38:03,370
Chad, you hear that?

4350
02:38:03,910 --> 02:38:05,310
Quantum skins don't help you.

4351
02:38:05,430 --> 02:38:06,670
Yeah, they don't help you.

4352
02:38:07,130 --> 02:38:08,310
And you don't have fun.

4353
02:38:08,430 --> 02:38:10,310
You will never have fun if you have it on.

4354
02:38:14,070 --> 02:38:15,810
That's my favorite comment in chat.

4355
02:38:16,740 --> 02:38:18,270
Oh shit, sorry.

4356
02:38:18,430 --> 02:38:19,850
Out of context, by the way.

4357
02:38:22,450 --> 02:38:24,950
I did not mean it like that.

4358
02:38:25,570 --> 02:38:27,170
I'm freezing.

4359
02:38:28,510 --> 02:38:29,330
Oh no!

4360
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:41,280
STDs is a problem.

4361
02:38:48,170 --> 02:38:49,280
Oh no.

4362
02:38:53,320 --> 02:38:55,260
Oh, I'm fucking dying.

4363
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:56,160
I'm dying.

4364
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:03,880
Oh my god.

4365
02:39:05,140 --> 02:39:07,200
I'm making it worse.

4366
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:08,340
I literally cannot.

4367
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:09,700
I cannot right now.

4368
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:15,800
Doki, I didn't know I was gonna literally die of laughter this entire tournament.

4369
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:17,060
This tournament.

4370
02:39:17,060 --> 02:39:17,180
This tournament.

4371
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:22,840
Wait, what's our thing this next one?

4372
02:39:22,900 --> 02:39:23,520
What are we gonna be?

4373
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:24,740
Oh yeah, last one.

4374
02:39:25,320 --> 02:39:26,280
Yeah, it's our last one.

4375
02:39:27,420 --> 02:39:28,540
And then we have day two tomorrow.

4376
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:30,060
Okay, then we have day two.

4377
02:39:33,400 --> 02:39:36,500
Wait, do you have any Futurama?

4378
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:37,840
Oh, I do.

4379
02:39:37,940 --> 02:39:38,640
I do have Futurama.

4380
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:39,340
I have Bendy.

4381
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:40,960
Okay, I have Leela.

4382
02:39:42,340 --> 02:39:43,460
Oh, you don't have Fry?

4383
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:44,420
No!

4384
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:45,880
No, I do have Fry.

4385
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:46,340
I have Fry.

4386
02:39:46,420 --> 02:39:47,640
Fry and Bendy, let's go!

4387
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:50,640
Fry and Bendy.

4388
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:52,820
Fry and Bendy, I'm gonna go get a golf club.

4389
02:39:53,980 --> 02:39:56,840
Yeah, we're gonna be pay to lose looking at it.

4390
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:00,380
Have you ever seen how big these freaking skins are?

4391
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:01,340
Yeah!

4392
02:40:02,140 --> 02:40:03,620
They are so ridiculous.

4393
02:40:04,500 --> 02:40:05,360
Let's go!

4394
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:07,420
Oh my god.

4395
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:09,660
Are we winning?

4396
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:10,740
Oh, we are totally winning.

4397
02:40:11,220 --> 02:40:12,020
We're winning in life.

4398
02:40:12,100 --> 02:40:12,940
That's all that matters.

4399
02:40:12,940 --> 02:40:15,620
We are consistent on our placement.

4400
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:17,460
We got one kill last game.

4401
02:40:18,060 --> 02:40:19,440
Pay to lose.

4402
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:23,320
What are you?

4403
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:24,460
I'm gonna use the stop sign.

4404
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:26,620
I'm running out of skins for tomorrow.

4405
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:29,760
Do Fortnite skins change hitbox size as well?

4406
02:40:30,040 --> 02:40:31,600
No, I believe they're all the same.

4407
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:35,640
There might be like three different variants, I think.

4408
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:37,800
There's like the very chonky big skins.

4409
02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:43,700
That's why you see all of them use that same fucking skin.

4410
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:46,260
Over and over again.

4411
02:40:46,820 --> 02:40:47,560
Giant Chicken Riot?

4412
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:48,780
We were already Giant Chicken.

4413
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:49,840
Yeah, we already did Giant Chicken.

4414
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:51,060
Somebody wasn't watching.

4415
02:40:51,800 --> 02:40:52,160
Yeah.

4416
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:54,160
It's there.

4417
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:55,040
Look in the VOD.

4418
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:56,700
I love you.

4419
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:58,380
I don't.

4420
02:40:59,320 --> 02:41:00,220
Fuck you.

4421
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:05,520
Yeah, cry!

4422
02:41:11,240 --> 02:41:13,500
I'm gonna use the Giant Inflatable Horse.

4423
02:41:14,220 --> 02:41:15,800
This is the win team right here.

4424
02:41:18,020 --> 02:41:18,860
41312 hours.

4425
02:41:24,260 --> 02:41:25,180
This is it.

4426
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:26,120
I believe.

4427
02:41:26,180 --> 02:41:26,200
This is it.

4428
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:27,000
Last game, guys.

4429
02:41:27,940 --> 02:41:31,020
This is last game and then we'll be free until tomorrow.

4430
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:32,380
Oh my god.

4431
02:41:32,420 --> 02:41:33,460
Are you ready for tomorrow?

4432
02:41:33,660 --> 02:41:34,060
Are you ready?

4433
02:41:34,220 --> 02:41:35,700
Today was just the warm up day.

4434
02:41:37,980 --> 02:41:39,800
Today's just the warm up.

4435
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:42,220
Wait, you haven't played this season, have you?

4436
02:41:42,420 --> 02:41:44,140
No, of course not.

4437
02:41:46,300 --> 02:41:47,720
Dude, you're in for a treat.

4438
02:41:47,860 --> 02:41:49,220
There's so much to digest.

4439
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:49,980
Holy shit.

4440
02:41:49,980 --> 02:41:51,260
In the current season.

4441
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:55,660
After this game, we gotta play one chill lobby.

4442
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:57,620
I'm down to do a chill lobby.

4443
02:41:57,820 --> 02:41:57,960
I'm down.

4444
02:41:57,960 --> 02:41:59,340
I wanna know what it feels like to actually shoot my gun.

4445
02:42:04,720 --> 02:42:06,900
No, you shot your gun once, right?

4446
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:08,640
Yeah, I shot my gun once last game.

4447
02:42:08,740 --> 02:42:12,400
But still, I wonder what it feels like to shoot more than one time.

4448
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:14,460
You know, get a kill, you know?

4449
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:16,620
I wanna know what it's like to be top 5.

4450
02:42:18,680 --> 02:42:21,100
Oh, we're gonna get so many top 5.

4451
02:42:21,140 --> 02:42:22,240
We're gonna get a top 1.

4452
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:23,660
Oh, it's okay.

4453
02:42:23,720 --> 02:42:24,340
They've posted the code yet.

4454
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:24,900
Oh, they haven't?

4455
02:42:24,980 --> 02:42:25,440
Thank god.

4456
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:27,140
Oh, they're typing it right now.

4457
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:29,460
Oh, I can Radiant Events.

4458
02:42:29,800 --> 02:42:30,160
That's good.

4459
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:30,720
Thank god.

4460
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:32,340
Oh yeah?

4461
02:42:32,580 --> 02:42:32,900
Oh shit.

4462
02:42:32,900 --> 02:42:33,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4463
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:37,020
They have... Oh wow, you're right.

4464
02:42:37,080 --> 02:42:38,400
They did add League of Legends back in.

4465
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:39,660
I didn't even notice that.

4466
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:41,520
Oh?

4467
02:42:41,940 --> 02:42:42,660
Wait, they stopped typing.

4468
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:47,860
Doge, are you gonna be a Fortnite streamer now after this tournament?

4469
02:42:48,140 --> 02:42:50,400
If I get a Fortnite skin, I'll be a Fortnite streamer.

4470
02:42:50,420 --> 02:42:51,140
You hear that, Fortnite?

4471
02:42:51,700 --> 02:42:52,280
Yeah, Fortnite.

4472
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:53,900
You hear that?

4473
02:42:55,100 --> 02:42:56,380
Doge, Doge's skin or Riot?

4474
02:42:58,020 --> 02:42:58,380
Yeah.

4475
02:42:59,060 --> 02:42:59,920
If you don't...

4476
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:04,000
Imagine, imagine the money you'll make...

4477
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:05,880
Having a VTuber skin.

4478
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:08,060
They have no VTuber skins yet.

4479
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:09,580
Yeah, imagine.

4480
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:11,820
Imagine.

4481
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:15,140
I am all in all for a VTuber skin.

4482
02:43:15,900 --> 02:43:17,800
And some furry skin.

4483
02:43:18,140 --> 02:43:19,080
Even though they already have a lot.

4484
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:21,520
The fuck?

4485
02:43:22,140 --> 02:43:23,100
Don't listen to him.

4486
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:23,860
I just want...

4487
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:25,420
I just want...

4488
02:43:25,420 --> 02:43:26,400
My skin.

4489
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:29,340
Doge, doge your Riot.

4490
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:30,180
Yeah.

4491
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:33,180
I just want my skin.

4492
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:37,100
I can't believe that guy had a...

4493
02:43:37,100 --> 02:43:38,480
A golden flopper.

4494
02:43:38,660 --> 02:43:39,260
Or whatever it's called.

4495
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:40,740
It's like apparently really rare.

4496
02:43:41,300 --> 02:43:42,680
Yeah, that's what like...

4497
02:43:42,680 --> 02:43:43,780
That's what peeps are saying.

4498
02:43:44,040 --> 02:43:46,760
Yeah, everybody's like, oh yeah, that's so rare to get.

4499
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:49,700
And then he threw that trophy and the guy just died.

4500
02:43:50,340 --> 02:43:52,340
It was like blunt head trauma.

4501
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:54,920
We got to like watch one person die to it.

4502
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:56,080
That's all that matters.

4503
02:43:56,400 --> 02:43:57,080
It's fucking crazy.

4504
02:43:57,200 --> 02:43:58,080
We witnessed a murder.

4505
02:43:58,540 --> 02:44:00,540
We witnessed a lot of murders, but like...

4506
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:02,920
That murder was like extra gruesome.

4507
02:44:03,560 --> 02:44:05,340
Are they streaming the tournament right now?

4508
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:07,320
Well, I mean, it's Twitch Rivals, so...

4509
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:08,420
Oh yeah, Twitch Rivals.

4510
02:44:08,520 --> 02:44:10,400
Yeah, cause you forget we're in the Twitch.

4511
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:11,560
Like, why are we playing?

4512
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:13,980
I saw that it was like State Farm.

4513
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:16,840
I wonder if State Farm is streaming.

4514
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:19,500
Oh, we got the code.

4515
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:20,180
Okay, we got the code.

4516
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:21,180
Nice.

4517
02:44:23,060 --> 02:44:23,540
Guys...

4518
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:24,620
I wanna...

4519
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:26,320
Doki a Fortnite skin.

4520
02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:30,940
I have children watching me.

4521
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:32,500
Even though they're not supposed to.

4522
02:44:34,900 --> 02:44:36,780
I found out.

4523
02:44:38,100 --> 02:44:39,180
There was a child...

4524
02:44:39,180 --> 02:44:41,500
There were children at my panel during a convention.

4525
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:42,780
So I know they exist.

4526
02:44:43,320 --> 02:44:43,760
And Fortnite...

4527
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:46,960
Yeah, one of my conventions I did.

4528
02:44:47,060 --> 02:44:48,620
I was like, I hope there's no children here.

4529
02:44:48,620 --> 02:44:50,040
Because I'm gonna swear.

4530
02:44:50,580 --> 02:44:52,180
And then there was a Q&A time.

4531
02:44:52,260 --> 02:44:54,780
And then they gave a microphone to a child that was like...

4532
02:44:54,780 --> 02:44:56,100
11 years old.

4533
02:44:56,520 --> 02:44:58,140
Cause I was like, how old are you?

4534
02:44:58,160 --> 02:44:58,880
And he's like, 11.

4535
02:44:59,180 --> 02:44:59,960
And I'm like, fuck.

4536
02:45:00,500 --> 02:45:01,800
And he just like...

4537
02:45:01,800 --> 02:45:04,480
Shriveled into a very...

4538
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:06,060
Shriveled up reason.

4539
02:45:07,700 --> 02:45:09,240
I was like, oh no.

4540
02:45:09,400 --> 02:45:11,320
Children should not be watching me.

4541
02:45:12,380 --> 02:45:15,080
I wonder if Twitch Rivals has shown us like...

4542
02:45:15,080 --> 02:45:15,720
Surviving.

4543
02:45:18,620 --> 02:45:20,320
If they want content, they gotta like...

4544
02:45:20,320 --> 02:45:21,240
Be in our call.

4545
02:45:23,180 --> 02:45:23,660
Oh,

4546
02:45:27,320 --> 02:45:28,200
there's condoms over there?

4547
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:29,020
There's condoms over there?

4548
02:45:29,380 --> 02:45:31,540
And we're the Coco Melon of YouTubing.

4549
02:45:31,720 --> 02:45:32,640
Yeah, that's me.

4550
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:36,560
What do you mean?

4551
02:45:36,620 --> 02:45:37,480
We literally...

4552
02:45:37,480 --> 02:45:38,500
Are you okay, Doryu?

4553
02:45:38,700 --> 02:45:39,920
No, I'm not okay.

4554
02:45:42,260 --> 02:45:43,860
We're literally the characters.

4555
02:45:44,260 --> 02:45:45,420
Everything's a blur.

4556
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:45,640
How?

4557
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:54,720
Wait, we gotta let...

4558
02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:56,780
We gotta let Fortnite know...

4559
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:58,280
That we do have children in our audience.

4560
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:01,700
Because Fortnite loves knowing that there's kids watching us.

4561
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:02,680
Cause that's...

4562
02:46:02,680 --> 02:46:03,880
People who spend money.

4563
02:46:04,340 --> 02:46:04,900
Apparently.

4564
02:46:06,020 --> 02:46:08,240
They watched us when we were Morty under the bridge?

4565
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:11,220
When we were what under the bridge?

4566
02:46:11,620 --> 02:46:13,260
Remember when we were Morty and...

4567
02:46:13,260 --> 02:46:14,360
Oh, we were...

4568
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:17,680
Yeah, they were watching us.

4569
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:22,240
Nice.

4570
02:46:23,340 --> 02:46:25,120
All I'm saying is that...

4571
02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:26,480
Oh, they're showing the standings.

4572
02:46:26,760 --> 02:46:27,880
Oh, no.

4573
02:46:28,140 --> 02:46:29,640
You don't want to watch that, Doryu.

4574
02:46:30,400 --> 02:46:31,580
We're gonna be in 15th.

4575
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:32,520
I'm calling right now.

4576
02:46:32,680 --> 02:46:36,300
I saw somebody mentioned that we were last at one point.

4577
02:46:36,420 --> 02:46:37,280
So you don't want to watch it.

4578
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:41,340
They obviously were not in last.

4579
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:42,380
Obviously.

4580
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:44,540
We've been playing out of our minds.

4581
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:47,500
No, it's gonna break your heart, Doryu.

4582
02:46:47,860 --> 02:46:48,640
I wouldn't...

4583
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:50,700
It's gonna break your heart when you see it.

4584
02:46:55,800 --> 02:46:56,320
Yo!

4585
02:46:56,580 --> 02:46:58,040
We're only two points behind the...

4586
02:46:58,040 --> 02:47:00,440
The other teams that are behind us.

4587
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:01,640
Or in front of us, I mean.

4588
02:47:02,260 --> 02:47:04,800
There's three teams that have eight points.

4589
02:47:04,840 --> 02:47:05,720
And we have six points.

4590
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:07,620
Wait, we have six points?

4591
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:08,880
We have six points.

4592
02:47:08,880 --> 02:47:10,220
How did they get eight points?

4593
02:47:10,340 --> 02:47:11,520
I literally see...

4594
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:12,820
J3 died.

4595
02:47:13,140 --> 02:47:15,200
First, like, 200 times.

4596
02:47:16,080 --> 02:47:18,440
That's because we're consistent on not dying.

4597
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:23,220
What the fuck?

4598
02:47:26,380 --> 02:47:27,400
Oh, they get kills.

4599
02:47:27,720 --> 02:47:29,620
Because we're just doing placement, but they have kills.

4600
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:30,600
Oh, that makes sense.

4601
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:32,200
That should make sense.

4602
02:47:32,300 --> 02:47:33,040
It's not fair.

4603
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:39,240
Seriously, the people around us are like the sweats that make it to top five every time.

4604
02:47:39,560 --> 02:47:40,240
Is it really?

4605
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:44,520
Yeah, we have the condom people and the Christmas hats people right next to us.

4606
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:45,560
Oh, you're right.

4607
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:46,640
It is the Christmas hat people.

4608
02:47:47,020 --> 02:47:48,660
It's the Christmas hats and the condoms.

4609
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:49,440
It's not fair!

4610
02:47:51,400 --> 02:47:55,580
I wonder, since it's the last game, if we're gonna get, like, ego sent on.

4611
02:47:56,120 --> 02:47:57,600
Maybe, for the points?

4612
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,340
Yeah, they're probably gonna be like, Mmm!

4613
02:48:00,100 --> 02:48:02,200
We killed one of them last time, though.

4614
02:48:03,400 --> 02:48:04,320
That's true.

4615
02:48:05,460 --> 02:48:06,580
Oh, I have Macarena.

4616
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:10,420
All it took was you to be like, Wait, there's someone here!

4617
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:14,540
And then we literally locked onto them and just destroyed them.

4618
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:19,220
Wait, let's sync up the Macarena.

4619
02:48:20,140 --> 02:48:20,480
Okay.

4620
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:21,440
Ready?

4621
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:23,740
You should keep a count.

4622
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:28,180
Three, two, one, go.

4623
02:48:37,060 --> 02:48:37,420
Macarena.

4624
02:48:45,900 --> 02:48:46,620
Macarena.

4625
02:48:49,480 --> 02:48:54,020
Yeah, no one can do it like we can.

4626
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:56,080
Yeah, at least we're having fun.

4627
02:48:57,800 --> 02:48:59,140
Yeah, what are those guys doing?

4628
02:48:59,420 --> 02:49:00,480
Not having fun?

4629
02:49:00,700 --> 02:49:01,300
Exactly!

4630
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:05,600
They're too busy strategizing.

4631
02:49:06,160 --> 02:49:07,840
We're peak Fortnite gamers.

4632
02:49:08,320 --> 02:49:11,660
Fortnite's not about sweating, it's about skins and dancing.

4633
02:49:12,580 --> 02:49:12,800
Yeah.

4634
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:15,460
That's how they got 5 million followers.

4635
02:49:16,300 --> 02:49:19,840
And RP servers, where you emote with Chun-Li and...

4636
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:22,020
The richest Fortnite streamer!

4637
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:27,520
All they do is dance and eat, dance and buy skins.

4638
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:30,680
We embody the real Fortnite gamers.

4639
02:49:31,720 --> 02:49:33,900
We are playing for the people.

4640
02:49:34,520 --> 02:49:35,760
Yeah, we're the people.

4641
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:40,080
You think the children are building 500 houses?

4642
02:49:40,580 --> 02:49:41,000
No!

4643
02:49:41,900 --> 02:49:44,400
They're out there being fucking bender.

4644
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:47,020
They're literally bender and emoting.

4645
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:50,340
And being every Jujutsu Kaisen skin variant.

4646
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:51,340
Exactly.

4647
02:49:51,720 --> 02:49:54,520
While playing Fortnite Festival.

4648
02:49:57,060 --> 02:49:59,120
Use my creator code, JokeyBrit.

4649
02:49:59,140 --> 02:50:00,220
Oh, I have that too!

4650
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:01,260
Oh, you have that one?

4651
02:50:01,420 --> 02:50:02,980
You have the My Hero Academia skins?

4652
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:03,700
No, I didn't.

4653
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:04,640
I just bought this.

4654
02:50:06,560 --> 02:50:08,800
I wanted this with John Cena.

4655
02:50:10,040 --> 02:50:11,260
Oh my god.

4656
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:12,480
I did not think of that comment.

4657
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:13,340
That's actually terrifying.

4658
02:50:14,460 --> 02:50:17,040
I bought this emote just for John Cena.

4659
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:20,340
Or for the people.

4660
02:50:22,080 --> 02:50:24,280
What is happening to my eyes?

4661
02:50:24,400 --> 02:50:25,100
We're gonna plant trees!

4662
02:50:26,400 --> 02:50:29,160
We're gonna plant trees and burn plastic.

4663
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:30,340
Yeah!

4664
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:32,620
Cause it's all about the balance.

4665
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:35,740
What the fuck is that?

4666
02:50:37,100 --> 02:50:38,520
What the fuck?

4667
02:50:38,940 --> 02:50:42,040
I love how everyone has that same reaction with this emote.

4668
02:50:42,160 --> 02:50:44,100
I had the same reaction when I first saw it.

4669
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:46,520
I'm like, what the fuck is he riding on?

4670
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:49,320
What the fuck is that?

4671
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:55,900
Ballerina, dancer, metal, rock and roll.

4672
02:50:56,080 --> 02:50:57,480
This is how you dance to metal, right?

4673
02:51:13,260 --> 02:51:15,940
This is the world that we grew up in.

4674
02:51:15,940 --> 02:51:16,720
Zero.

4675
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:18,560
Yay!

4676
02:51:19,580 --> 02:51:21,620
Doesn't this reset every season?

4677
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:24,600
I know I've won Fortnite games!

4678
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:26,940
Oh yeah, it resets every season.

4679
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,940
I was like, why did I have zero crowns?

4680
02:51:33,540 --> 02:51:35,280
It doesn't even cover my hair.

4681
02:51:35,880 --> 02:51:36,660
Wait, it doesn't?

4682
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:37,380
Yeah, the umbrella.

4683
02:51:38,580 --> 02:51:39,680
It's got a big ass head.

4684
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:42,960
Go Doki, give us nothing!

4685
02:51:47,860 --> 02:51:50,360
Chat, what is this one?

4686
02:51:50,640 --> 02:51:52,140
I don't remember having that.

4687
02:51:52,320 --> 02:51:53,420
Nice if I had a crown.

4688
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:56,880
Obviously, chat, we're gonna kill the whole lobby.

4689
02:51:57,760 --> 02:51:58,760
This is different.

4690
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:03,220
Oh my god, there's condoms all around us.

4691
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:05,680
Wait, I've never seen these guys before.

4692
02:52:05,780 --> 02:52:07,560
They must die before they can do anything.

4693
02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:09,460
Oh, I see you.

4694
02:52:10,040 --> 02:52:11,040
Oh, did you drop your crown?

4695
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:12,080
I did.

4696
02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:12,780
Nice.

4697
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:16,240
Nobody wants to join our band, they know we're losers.

4698
02:52:18,320 --> 02:52:21,220
We were cool before they even knew what the word cool was.

4699
02:52:24,380 --> 02:52:25,880
Alright, let's go!

4700
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:27,940
This is the one!

4701
02:52:28,140 --> 02:52:29,340
Alright, let me know when to land.

4702
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:31,420
Okay, let me ping it.

4703
02:52:32,320 --> 02:52:34,400
And then drop...

4704
02:52:34,400 --> 02:52:34,680
now.

4705
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:36,960
Oh my god!

4706
02:52:37,080 --> 02:52:38,440
We got the floaties!

4707
02:52:38,440 --> 02:52:40,440
We got the little floaties!

4708
02:52:43,260 --> 02:52:43,640
Yay!

4709
02:52:44,460 --> 02:52:46,220
Bender has summoned Shenron!

4710
02:52:47,540 --> 02:52:48,840
Alright, here we go again.

4711
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:50,060
I'm gonna laugh.

4712
02:52:50,140 --> 02:52:52,000
These guys are gonna probably shockwave on me one day.

4713
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:53,920
Like right now.

4714
02:52:55,280 --> 02:52:56,860
Oh, I got a shockwave!

4715
02:52:57,460 --> 02:52:58,160
Oh, I got trees!

4716
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:00,100
Oh, I got trees!

4717
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:01,880
Let's go!

4718
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:03,380
Tree time!

4719
02:53:05,360 --> 02:53:07,300
Oh, I got more shockwaves?

4720
02:53:08,740 --> 02:53:10,260
I'm getting faster at looting.

4721
02:53:10,460 --> 02:53:12,000
You can see each game I'm improving.

4722
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:13,040
Dang!

4723
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:14,540
See, they don't even know.

4724
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:16,800
Oh, they're trying to push me.

4725
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:17,880
Wait, are they actually?

4726
02:53:18,100 --> 02:53:19,100
Yeah, they're actually pushing me.

4727
02:53:19,540 --> 02:53:20,760
Wait, that's not good.

4728
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:23,440
I am gonna do this.

4729
02:53:23,540 --> 02:53:24,560
Guys, let's play the game!

4730
02:53:27,160 --> 02:53:27,600
Shockwaving?

4731
02:53:28,620 --> 02:53:31,500
These guys, I knew they were gonna be so horny for me.

4732
02:53:32,100 --> 02:53:32,600
Right here?

4733
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:36,340
Where are they?

4734
02:53:36,860 --> 02:53:37,660
On my bunk?

4735
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:40,160
Wait, where are you?

4736
02:53:40,580 --> 02:53:42,340
I'm on your rooftop right now.

4737
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:43,840
I'm gonna loot.

4738
02:53:44,100 --> 02:53:45,300
They're not gonna kill me, right?

4739
02:53:45,860 --> 02:53:47,840
Nah, they're gonna kill Fry.

4740
02:53:49,080 --> 02:53:49,600
Yeah.

4741
02:53:52,160 --> 02:53:55,400
They burned their three jump pads, so...

4742
02:53:55,400 --> 02:53:56,620
I'm just gonna get up.

4743
02:53:56,700 --> 02:53:58,660
I have those splash juices.

4744
02:53:59,340 --> 02:54:01,120
Okay, yeah, just loot everything.

4745
02:54:01,260 --> 02:54:01,940
I'm gonna push on the rooftop.

4746
02:54:02,120 --> 02:54:02,880
I'll tell you if they push or not.

4747
02:54:02,880 --> 02:54:03,080
Okay.

4748
02:54:09,500 --> 02:54:10,220
I'm ready.

4749
02:54:10,380 --> 02:54:11,300
Stop pushing?

4750
02:54:13,380 --> 02:54:14,980
Are you still chilling on the roof?

4751
02:54:15,300 --> 02:54:16,600
Yeah, I'm still chilling up here.

4752
02:54:16,640 --> 02:54:17,640
I'm just watching for them.

4753
02:54:18,140 --> 02:54:18,400
Hello.

4754
02:54:19,360 --> 02:54:20,760
I'm gonna smash splashes.

4755
02:54:22,860 --> 02:54:23,700
Oh, yeah.

4756
02:54:24,080 --> 02:54:24,520
Splash.

4757
02:54:26,520 --> 02:54:27,540
You're gonna get shot.

4758
02:54:27,740 --> 02:54:28,620
I hope you get shot.

4759
02:54:31,440 --> 02:54:33,260
Oh, you fucking get shot, dude.

4760
02:54:34,700 --> 02:54:35,360
There's a...

4761
02:54:35,360 --> 02:54:36,500
There's a shield potion here.

4762
02:54:36,900 --> 02:54:37,300
Oh, there is?

4763
02:54:37,320 --> 02:54:37,840
Oh, can you grab that?

4764
02:54:38,140 --> 02:54:39,120
I'm gonna chill up here.

4765
02:54:39,160 --> 02:54:40,160
I'm gonna keep watching for them.

4766
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:42,700
I'm pretty sure they just, like, ran.

4767
02:54:43,640 --> 02:54:44,620
But we're gonna, like...

4768
02:54:44,620 --> 02:54:48,780
We can eat some storm and we can literally wrap all the way around here.

4769
02:54:49,480 --> 02:54:52,460
Or we can swim all the way around over here.

4770
02:54:52,720 --> 02:54:53,060
Okay.

4771
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:56,020
We're living this.

4772
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:56,620
We're living.

4773
02:54:56,920 --> 02:54:58,040
Yeah, we're survivors.

4774
02:54:58,040 --> 02:55:00,140
Oh, there's...

4775
02:55:00,140 --> 02:55:01,640
Why is it peaked again?

4776
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:04,140
Oh, I see a condom scene down there.

4777
02:55:05,080 --> 02:55:05,780
Wait, where's the...

4778
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:06,940
Where's the shield at?

4779
02:55:07,320 --> 02:55:08,840
Oh, I can drop it.

4780
02:55:09,260 --> 02:55:09,780
Okay, okay.

4781
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:12,320
Thank you.

4782
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:18,040
Honestly, we can probably just go...

4783
02:55:19,220 --> 02:55:20,700
We can go in the water now.

4784
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,320
Here, follow me.

4785
02:55:21,580 --> 02:55:21,840
Alright.

4786
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,340
We're gonna eat storm.

4787
02:55:23,340 --> 02:55:24,660
We're gonna get some weapons.

4788
02:55:25,420 --> 02:55:27,700
I have bandages, so I'm fine with that.

4789
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:28,460
Oh, you got bandages?

4790
02:55:28,640 --> 02:55:28,980
Sweet.

4791
02:55:33,640 --> 02:55:34,480
I'm gonna laugh.

4792
02:55:34,600 --> 02:55:35,760
This guy's gonna be in the bush right here.

4793
02:55:35,820 --> 02:55:36,660
I'm calling it right now.

4794
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:37,960
No, please don't.

4795
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:39,340
Please don't.

4796
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:41,340
Please.

4797
02:55:42,660 --> 02:55:43,660
Please, I'm scared.

4798
02:55:44,300 --> 02:55:45,080
I'm just a robot.

4799
02:55:47,420 --> 02:55:48,560
Get to the left.

4800
02:55:48,820 --> 02:55:50,300
I'm just a little robot.

4801
02:55:51,740 --> 02:55:52,820
At least you got bandages.

4802
02:55:52,940 --> 02:56:00,020
The only thing you gotta make sure of is don't heal until we're away from the scene because it'll show an indicator when we're healing.

4803
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:00,840
Oh wait, really?

4804
02:56:01,420 --> 02:56:04,920
Yeah, it's all for that sound thing, yeah.

4805
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:07,440
Oh, so that's why everybody has it on.

4806
02:56:08,380 --> 02:56:11,240
Yeah, and it'll show that and then you can just see all the footsteps and stuff.

4807
02:56:11,300 --> 02:56:12,140
It's really, really good.

4808
02:56:12,440 --> 02:56:12,700
Oh.

4809
02:56:14,620 --> 02:56:15,740
We're so good.

4810
02:56:16,840 --> 02:56:19,220
Guys, guys, kill this duo!

4811
02:56:21,300 --> 02:56:22,720
What is he doing?

4812
02:56:23,880 --> 02:56:24,900
Oh, I got bandages.

4813
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:25,240
We're good.

4814
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:26,000
Okay, we can heal here.

4815
02:56:29,160 --> 02:56:30,940
There's some pads here if you need movement.

4816
02:56:31,900 --> 02:56:33,500
Oh, yeah, I'll take that.

4817
02:56:35,560 --> 02:56:36,320
We're living.

4818
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:38,200
I feel alive.

4819
02:56:38,380 --> 02:56:40,680
I feel so alive with my 40 HP.

4820
02:56:41,420 --> 02:56:42,600
Oh my god, I see a team out here.

4821
02:56:42,700 --> 02:56:43,240
Okay, chill inside.

4822
02:56:43,980 --> 02:56:44,400
We're good.

4823
02:56:44,480 --> 02:56:44,740
We're good.

4824
02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:46,260
Oh, they heard me bandage.

4825
02:56:46,360 --> 02:56:47,580
They're all the way across.

4826
02:56:47,740 --> 02:56:48,560
No, I don't think they saw us.

4827
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:50,680
I see one.

4828
02:56:50,860 --> 02:56:51,740
Oh, they definitely see us.

4829
02:56:53,740 --> 02:56:54,700
Almost cracked this guy.

4830
02:56:56,440 --> 02:56:57,940
I'm just gonna slide to the side.

4831
02:56:59,120 --> 02:56:59,640
I see them.

4832
02:56:59,800 --> 02:57:00,620
They're in the bunker, yeah.

4833
02:57:03,780 --> 02:57:04,220
It's fine.

4834
02:57:04,300 --> 02:57:06,560
I just want to apply pressure just so that way they keep on moving.

4835
02:57:07,140 --> 02:57:07,980
Oh, I got a medkit.

4836
02:57:09,360 --> 02:57:10,200
Okay, I'm bandaging.

4837
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:11,120
Okay.

4838
02:57:11,940 --> 02:57:12,740
I'm gonna chill on the roof.

4839
02:57:13,620 --> 02:57:14,720
Why are you doing it?

4840
02:57:14,940 --> 02:57:15,120
Leave!

4841
02:57:15,840 --> 02:57:17,600
We have none of meds for you!

4842
02:57:20,220 --> 02:57:21,380
Keep on looting the house.

4843
02:57:21,500 --> 02:57:22,440
Come over here to this house.

4844
02:57:22,780 --> 02:57:25,180
And then we can see maybe there's heals over here.

4845
02:57:30,040 --> 02:57:31,860
Oh, they just bonked again.

4846
02:57:32,480 --> 02:57:34,020
Stop wasting your resources!

4847
02:57:35,100 --> 02:57:36,000
So real.

4848
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:37,000
They're right there.

4849
02:57:40,580 --> 02:57:42,200
You're gonna get nothing from us.

4850
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:45,920
Oh, they threw a medkit.

4851
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:47,320
Okay, well I'm gonna have to heal.

4852
02:57:48,040 --> 02:57:49,480
I have more bandages so you need some.

4853
02:57:49,880 --> 02:57:51,380
Okay, just keep on holding on to those.

4854
02:57:51,740 --> 02:57:53,380
You can play that angle.

4855
02:57:54,060 --> 02:57:54,340
Oh!

4856
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:56,440
Okay, I guess not.

4857
02:57:56,560 --> 02:57:58,000
They might push.

4858
02:57:58,360 --> 02:57:58,820
I'm watching.

4859
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:00,520
You can heal.

4860
02:58:00,620 --> 02:58:00,820
You can heal.

4861
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:01,440
I'm watching.

4862
02:58:01,540 --> 02:58:02,260
Yeah, it's fine.

4863
02:58:02,380 --> 02:58:06,180
I just popped the medkit.

4864
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:06,960
I'm good.

4865
02:58:07,360 --> 02:58:08,920
I'm good too, I think.

4866
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:11,500
I'm gonna get on the rooftop.

4867
02:58:12,260 --> 02:58:13,620
I'm gonna non-stop heal.

4868
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:15,600
There's another launch pad.

4869
02:58:15,660 --> 02:58:16,400
I'm gonna grab those.

4870
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:20,300
Yeah, but you can shockwave away.

4871
02:58:20,700 --> 02:58:21,460
Wait, they have the crown?

4872
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:22,140
What the frick?

4873
02:58:23,940 --> 02:58:24,300
Timing?

4874
02:58:25,220 --> 02:58:27,420
Okay, I'm gonna shockwave to the right.

4875
02:58:27,500 --> 02:58:28,060
I'm gonna go right.

4876
02:58:29,560 --> 02:58:32,360
I'm gonna try to get ahead of them so they don't wrap around us.

4877
02:58:32,860 --> 02:58:33,400
Should I come over?

4878
02:58:34,020 --> 02:58:34,540
Uh, yeah.

4879
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:35,000
Come on over.

4880
02:58:36,300 --> 02:58:36,660
Wee!

4881
02:58:36,700 --> 02:58:37,360
Oh, I fucked up.

4882
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:38,960
Woo!

4883
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:44,260
So I'm just trying to find some heals.

4884
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:46,880
We can actually go through here?

4885
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:48,480
Those bandages.

4886
02:58:50,200 --> 02:58:51,240
Oh yeah, there's bandages.

4887
02:58:51,400 --> 02:58:51,800
There's bandages.

4888
02:58:54,780 --> 02:58:55,880
Oh, do you need shockwaves?

4889
02:58:56,380 --> 02:58:56,840
I'm good.

4890
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:58,080
There's a heal here.

4891
02:58:59,020 --> 02:59:00,280
Do you have any gold for me?

4892
02:59:00,920 --> 02:59:01,400
Oh, no.

4893
02:59:01,460 --> 02:59:01,840
I have zero.

4894
02:59:02,040 --> 02:59:02,920
I didn't realize you need money.

4895
02:59:03,340 --> 02:59:03,880
Okay, you're good.

4896
02:59:04,360 --> 02:59:05,080
Oh, I have a medkit.

4897
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:06,220
Yeah, just go and heal on that.

4898
02:59:06,760 --> 02:59:10,840
And then we're gonna have to, like, run into storm on the... or run from storm.

4899
02:59:11,660 --> 02:59:12,740
Um, on this next one.

4900
02:59:15,100 --> 02:59:16,140
Oh, there's a chest here.

4901
02:59:17,360 --> 02:59:18,400
Oh, I found bandages?

4902
02:59:18,740 --> 02:59:19,060
Sweet.

4903
02:59:19,640 --> 02:59:21,380
Oh, I found splashies.

4904
02:59:21,380 --> 02:59:22,580
Oh, huge, huge, huge.

4905
02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:23,880
Okay, you can just use them on yourself.

4906
02:59:24,620 --> 02:59:26,680
And then, um, I'm gonna have bandages for us.

4907
02:59:29,380 --> 02:59:30,460
Oh, I have gold too.

4908
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:32,060
Oh, we got medkits here.

4909
02:59:32,200 --> 02:59:32,700
There's medkits.

4910
02:59:32,860 --> 02:59:33,920
Oh, I need those.

4911
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:35,300
Yay, I'm gonna toss it your way.

4912
02:59:36,140 --> 02:59:38,120
And then, uh, come out from the cave over here.

4913
02:59:38,860 --> 02:59:40,280
Uh, just come towards me on this side.

4914
02:59:40,440 --> 02:59:40,680
Okay.

4915
02:59:44,900 --> 02:59:47,780
Then I'm just gonna toss it here at the edge.

4916
02:59:48,920 --> 02:59:51,900
And then, uh, before you use your splashes...

4917
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:52,720
I already used it.

4918
02:59:53,320 --> 02:59:53,740
Oh, you did?

4919
02:59:53,800 --> 02:59:55,180
Okay, use those first.

4920
02:59:58,400 --> 02:59:59,340
Oh, where's the medkit?

4921
02:59:59,980 --> 03:00:03,120
Uh, it's to the... it's right below, uh, right here.

4922
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:04,280
Oh, okay.

4923
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:07,560
Wait, where?

4924
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:09,000
Oh, it's right here.

4925
03:00:09,020 --> 03:00:09,520
I got another one.

4926
03:00:09,940 --> 03:00:10,940
Oh, it's right there!

4927
03:00:11,060 --> 03:00:11,720
Okay, it's my turn.

4928
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:12,080
Grab it.

4929
03:00:12,160 --> 03:00:12,360
I can grab it.

4930
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:13,460
I'll toss you another one.

4931
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:16,020
I'm coming back.

4932
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:18,140
We got 30 seconds and we're gonna have to start going.

4933
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:20,980
I think I see a team over here.

4934
03:00:25,300 --> 03:00:26,820
We're medkitting up now.

4935
03:00:27,320 --> 03:00:28,400
Okay, I'm gonna medkit too.

4936
03:00:32,910 --> 03:00:34,890
Oh, I see a team's literally on the edge.

4937
03:00:34,890 --> 03:00:37,010
No, leave us alone!

4938
03:00:38,390 --> 03:00:39,110
Uh, where's this next one?

4939
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:41,290
Oh my god, this zone pull sucks.

4940
03:00:45,810 --> 03:00:53,530
It's not until we eat, uh, I think 500 storm damage that it starts doing storm sickness, so we should be okay.

4941
03:00:53,830 --> 03:00:54,710
Storm sickness?

4942
03:00:55,290 --> 03:00:58,190
Yeah, that's where, like, you start taking, like, increased damage rapidly.

4943
03:00:58,190 --> 03:00:59,130
What the fuck?

4944
03:00:59,230 --> 03:00:59,510
Okay.

4945
03:01:03,610 --> 03:01:08,770
Okay, there's gonna be a team on the other side of that mountain, but we should be okay down here for now.

4946
03:01:11,750 --> 03:01:12,810
More running over.

4947
03:01:13,150 --> 03:01:13,830
I'm scared, though.

4948
03:01:13,830 --> 03:01:14,810
Okay, we're gonna go left.

4949
03:01:15,590 --> 03:01:18,170
Oh, there's, is that, is 9 gold enough?

4950
03:01:18,930 --> 03:01:21,130
No, it's, uh, I think 50.

4951
03:01:21,790 --> 03:01:22,230
Goddammit.

4952
03:01:25,770 --> 03:01:27,570
Wow, no one is dying this game.

4953
03:01:27,830 --> 03:01:29,330
Please don't tell me that was to me.

4954
03:01:29,890 --> 03:01:31,690
Okay, I'm gonna shockwave over here, Doki.

4955
03:01:32,030 --> 03:01:33,110
Okay, I need healing.

4956
03:01:33,110 --> 03:01:34,790
Okay, I might be able to just run in.

4957
03:01:35,670 --> 03:01:36,290
I had to heal.

4958
03:01:36,850 --> 03:01:39,350
Yeah, you're good, you're good, you're good.

4959
03:01:41,550 --> 03:01:43,610
Why is everybody being careful?

4960
03:01:44,010 --> 03:01:44,510
Oh, there's nobody!

4961
03:01:45,430 --> 03:01:46,090
Oh, no!

4962
03:01:46,390 --> 03:01:47,090
Are they shooting you?

4963
03:01:47,310 --> 03:01:48,850
Uh, jump yourself, or launch yourself.

4964
03:01:48,950 --> 03:01:49,410
I'm looking, I'm looking.

4965
03:01:50,210 --> 03:01:52,010
Oh my god, there's a team here!

4966
03:01:52,450 --> 03:01:53,390
Oh, respawn, respawn, respawn.

4967
03:01:53,970 --> 03:01:54,370
Live!

4968
03:01:54,790 --> 03:01:55,050
Live!

4969
03:01:55,810 --> 03:01:57,110
I'm living, I'm living, I'm living.

4970
03:01:57,450 --> 03:01:58,550
Just live!

4971
03:01:59,130 --> 03:01:59,830
I'm living!

4972
03:02:00,270 --> 03:02:01,370
You're gonna be good!

4973
03:02:01,370 --> 03:02:01,370
Live!

4974
03:02:02,310 --> 03:02:07,170
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

4975
03:02:07,730 --> 03:02:08,430
We're good!

4976
03:02:08,490 --> 03:02:10,990
Wait, I should just die in the... Oh wait, no, I have nothing.

4977
03:02:11,210 --> 03:02:12,530
I didn't realize you lose everything.

4978
03:02:12,590 --> 03:02:14,870
You can land on the house, land on the house right there, the one I pinged.

4979
03:02:14,930 --> 03:02:15,210
Okay.

4980
03:02:17,530 --> 03:02:20,210
Please be nobody, I'm just Bender.

4981
03:02:22,750 --> 03:02:24,550
Alright, I'll let you know if there's people in here.

4982
03:02:25,030 --> 03:02:25,350
Alright.

4983
03:02:27,130 --> 03:02:28,870
There's nobody here for now.

4984
03:02:29,730 --> 03:02:31,590
Where is this team at?

4985
03:02:31,650 --> 03:02:33,330
They're like, in storm?

4986
03:02:36,770 --> 03:02:39,530
Jesus, I'm hearing all of these fucking noises.

4987
03:02:40,050 --> 03:02:41,530
Oh, it's ending in a minute.

4988
03:02:42,050 --> 03:02:42,050
I'm going in.

4989
03:02:42,390 --> 03:02:43,770
I'm here with you, I'm here with you.

4990
03:02:44,190 --> 03:02:45,410
We inside this.

4991
03:02:46,910 --> 03:02:48,850
I'm gonna give you the jump pads for now.

4992
03:02:48,950 --> 03:02:49,150
Okay.

4993
03:02:50,190 --> 03:02:51,930
Don't worry, I have 500 guns.

4994
03:02:52,910 --> 03:02:53,990
Ayo, you got 500 guns?

4995
03:02:54,010 --> 03:02:54,490
Oh, you need ammo?

4996
03:02:54,850 --> 03:02:55,590
No, I'm good.

4997
03:02:55,870 --> 03:02:56,270
I have ammo.

4998
03:02:56,270 --> 03:02:56,450
Okay.

4999
03:02:58,010 --> 03:03:00,270
Next zone is...

5000
03:03:01,670 --> 03:03:04,570
Do they have 200 RPGs?

5001
03:03:05,410 --> 03:03:06,210
Oh, team coming over?

5002
03:03:07,530 --> 03:03:08,270
I think?

5003
03:03:09,050 --> 03:03:09,490
Where?

5004
03:03:09,910 --> 03:03:10,930
From which direction?

5005
03:03:11,250 --> 03:03:12,710
People here?

5006
03:03:13,530 --> 03:03:14,570
Wait, there's teams on top.

5007
03:03:16,690 --> 03:03:19,010
I don't have SMGs.

5008
03:03:19,350 --> 03:03:20,270
And a rifle.

5009
03:03:21,070 --> 03:03:23,250
I'm trying to see what I can...

5010
03:03:23,250 --> 03:03:24,190
what we can play.

5011
03:03:25,710 --> 03:03:26,910
Oh, we can go this house.

5012
03:03:27,010 --> 03:03:27,250
Okay.

5013
03:03:27,510 --> 03:03:29,230
We're gonna try to get to the blue house, okay?

5014
03:03:30,110 --> 03:03:31,190
Okay, how do we get there?

5015
03:03:31,970 --> 03:03:34,690
Let's burn a shockwave where your jump pad to get over, okay?

5016
03:03:34,850 --> 03:03:37,410
Get to the blue ping, I'm gonna go now.

5017
03:03:38,150 --> 03:03:40,470
I think there's actually a team in here, but I'm going in.

5018
03:03:41,250 --> 03:03:42,630
Oh, I see a team outside.

5019
03:03:42,910 --> 03:03:43,830
I'm safe inside.

5020
03:03:44,610 --> 03:03:47,290
Oh, he saw me, they saw me.

5021
03:03:48,130 --> 03:03:48,850
You're good, you're good, you're good.

5022
03:03:49,450 --> 03:03:50,270
It's a lower cross.

5023
03:03:50,630 --> 03:03:51,950
They saw us, they saw us.

5024
03:03:53,350 --> 03:03:54,490
I think they're gonna try to push us.

5025
03:03:55,170 --> 03:03:55,490
100%.

5026
03:03:55,490 --> 03:03:56,390
I'm just waiting for the bubble to go down.

5027
03:03:56,390 --> 03:03:58,210
It's gonna go down in 3, 2...

5028
03:03:58,210 --> 03:03:59,770
Oh, no, never mind, they tossed another one.

5029
03:04:01,990 --> 03:04:05,270
It's gonna go down in...

5030
03:04:07,250 --> 03:04:08,730
3, 2, 1.

5031
03:04:09,070 --> 03:04:09,950
Okay, they burned another one.

5032
03:04:10,410 --> 03:04:11,550
They burned another?

5033
03:04:12,130 --> 03:04:14,090
Yeah, they're just trying to prolong the...

5034
03:04:14,090 --> 03:04:16,030
You know how it'd be in BRs, they're just trying to live.

5035
03:04:16,110 --> 03:04:16,410
Yeah.

5036
03:04:17,390 --> 03:04:18,710
I see them, they're running to our left.

5037
03:04:18,770 --> 03:04:19,510
They're running to our left.

5038
03:04:19,630 --> 03:04:21,110
Okay, this is good, we're chill inside.

5039
03:04:21,970 --> 03:04:24,290
I see them, I see them, they're to our left right now.

5040
03:04:24,970 --> 03:04:25,930
They might try to get to here.

5041
03:04:26,270 --> 03:04:27,530
On the roof, yeah, yeah.

5042
03:04:31,150 --> 03:04:33,390
They should theoretically get shot at by...

5043
03:04:33,390 --> 03:04:34,330
Oh, they're underneath, they're underneath.

5044
03:04:34,450 --> 03:04:35,350
They're gonna try to climb on this.

5045
03:04:36,270 --> 03:04:36,810
Are they wearing a shotgun?

5046
03:04:39,450 --> 03:04:40,550
Oh, they're climbing.

5047
03:04:40,690 --> 03:04:41,210
They're climbing right here.

5048
03:04:41,210 --> 03:04:41,930
They're right here, right here.

5049
03:04:44,290 --> 03:04:45,450
Okay, watch the staircase.

5050
03:04:46,210 --> 03:04:47,390
Okay, I'm gonna go underneath, go underneath, go underneath.

5051
03:04:47,810 --> 03:04:48,350
Come, come, come.

5052
03:04:51,690 --> 03:04:52,230
What the?

5053
03:04:52,350 --> 03:04:53,130
Oh, I'm trying to move.

5054
03:04:53,290 --> 03:04:53,890
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.

5055
03:04:55,050 --> 03:04:56,290
They're getting shot, they're getting shot.

5056
03:04:58,130 --> 03:04:58,710
Oh, god.

5057
03:04:59,770 --> 03:05:00,470
Knocked one, knocked one.

5058
03:05:00,850 --> 03:05:03,170
Thirsting, I got the thirst.

5059
03:05:03,250 --> 03:05:04,110
It's okay, I got the thirst.

5060
03:05:04,990 --> 03:05:05,510
I'm good.

5061
03:05:05,770 --> 03:05:07,370
I got the thirst for you.

5062
03:05:08,010 --> 03:05:09,550
I got the thirst.

5063
03:05:09,850 --> 03:05:10,190
Oh, god.

5064
03:05:10,990 --> 03:05:12,410
Just live, we have a point.

5065
03:05:12,430 --> 03:05:12,930
I'm living.

5066
03:05:14,870 --> 03:05:15,670
Just live.

5067
03:05:17,370 --> 03:05:18,170
Oh, shit.

5068
03:05:19,090 --> 03:05:21,110
Oh, that's another team, that's a full team, that's a full team.

5069
03:05:21,390 --> 03:05:22,430
Live in the bush if you can.

5070
03:05:22,730 --> 03:05:24,030
Live in somebody's house.

5071
03:05:24,690 --> 03:05:25,550
Faster, hustle.

5072
03:05:26,670 --> 03:05:27,790
There's a point.

5073
03:05:28,370 --> 03:05:28,870
You get a point.

5074
03:05:30,790 --> 03:05:32,210
You get a point.

5075
03:05:32,810 --> 03:05:35,090
We got a point, I was trying to get the other one.

5076
03:05:35,090 --> 03:05:36,070
Oh, my god.

5077
03:05:38,950 --> 03:05:39,630
Oh, my god.

5078
03:05:39,630 --> 03:05:40,810
We got a point.

5079
03:05:43,070 --> 03:05:43,970
That's what it is.

5080
03:05:44,810 --> 03:05:47,110
Yo, Doki, we placed 13th, we got 13th.

5081
03:05:47,130 --> 03:05:47,750
We did better.

5082
03:05:49,530 --> 03:05:51,470
Wait, you killed the guy that's in first?

5083
03:05:51,550 --> 03:05:52,030
That's a victory?

5084
03:05:52,310 --> 03:05:52,890
Wait, what?

5085
03:05:54,010 --> 03:05:56,050
Oh, no, you're saying that's a victory in general.

5086
03:05:56,230 --> 03:05:59,070
Oh, no, we got, we got, we killed somebody.

5087
03:05:59,170 --> 03:06:00,310
That's a victory, yeah.

5088
03:06:00,710 --> 03:06:03,570
We got randomly rocketed, it wasn't even the same team.

5089
03:06:03,570 --> 03:06:04,510
Wait, really?

5090
03:06:04,710 --> 03:06:05,570
No, we could have got two points.

5091
03:06:05,570 --> 03:06:07,650
You didn't notice our sneak and kill, yeah.

5092
03:06:07,890 --> 03:06:10,510
Yeah, because I was like, no, there's three of you.

5093
03:06:14,930 --> 03:06:17,830
Bro, they should remove rocket launchers.

5094
03:06:18,170 --> 03:06:21,050
Remove bunkers and rocket launchers.

5095
03:06:21,130 --> 03:06:22,170
That's all I want.

5096
03:06:25,030 --> 03:06:26,770
Random RPG moment.

5097
03:06:27,290 --> 03:06:29,760
Is there a special rule for killing the first place player?

5098
03:06:30,690 --> 03:06:31,290
Let me see.

5099
03:06:31,290 --> 03:06:32,790
I don't think so.

5100
03:06:33,650 --> 03:06:35,190
Because he still lives.

5101
03:06:37,610 --> 03:06:39,430
He's the one that got dokey in Storm?

5102
03:06:39,550 --> 03:06:40,430
Epic revenge moment?

5103
03:06:40,670 --> 03:06:41,670
Yes, let's go.

5104
03:06:41,690 --> 03:06:43,030
Nice, fuck them.

5105
03:06:43,530 --> 03:06:44,670
Yeah, fuck them.

5106
03:06:45,550 --> 03:06:46,910
Eat a wiener, end game.

5107
03:06:47,390 --> 03:06:48,710
Or IRL, if that's your thing.

5108
03:06:48,910 --> 03:06:50,750
I love how you broke into that guy's house just to kill him.

5109
03:06:50,790 --> 03:06:51,430
That's fucked up.

5110
03:06:51,790 --> 03:06:53,030
That's so fucked up.

5111
03:06:53,910 --> 03:06:55,410
He's probably like, leave me alone, bro.

5112
03:06:55,510 --> 03:06:56,310
I'm just here.

5113
03:06:58,430 --> 03:07:00,390
Let me see the rules.

5114
03:07:00,530 --> 03:07:00,830
Let's see.

5115
03:07:01,250 --> 03:07:01,930
Format.

5116
03:07:08,110 --> 03:07:10,370
Total number of players in the event.

5117
03:07:10,910 --> 03:07:11,530
Oh my god.

5118
03:07:11,910 --> 03:07:14,070
There's only one condom team.

5119
03:07:14,870 --> 03:07:16,130
Wait, only one condom team?

5120
03:07:16,130 --> 03:07:17,450
Yeah, there's only one.

5121
03:07:17,990 --> 03:07:20,730
JK, there's two.

5122
03:07:22,410 --> 03:07:24,050
The other guy's a solo.

5123
03:07:25,490 --> 03:07:26,550
Wait, no, what?

5124
03:07:26,770 --> 03:07:28,050
How is this...

5125
03:07:29,010 --> 03:07:30,170
What the fuck?

5126
03:07:31,410 --> 03:07:32,410
Hey, they have high ground.

5127
03:07:32,490 --> 03:07:33,770
How do they always have zone?

5128
03:07:33,990 --> 03:07:34,890
This is not fair.

5129
03:07:36,310 --> 03:07:37,710
These guys are on to something.

5130
03:07:37,730 --> 03:07:38,550
Oh wait, what the hell?

5131
03:07:38,770 --> 03:07:39,990
Oh, that's the POI.

5132
03:07:40,090 --> 03:07:41,950
I was so confused by that giant metal structure.

5133
03:07:45,210 --> 03:07:46,550
Wait, is that POI?

5134
03:07:47,170 --> 03:07:47,810
Or like...

5135
03:07:47,810 --> 03:07:49,630
It's like an iconic thing, I think.

5136
03:07:49,790 --> 03:07:51,210
Yeah, yeah, because there's a llama.

5137
03:07:52,270 --> 03:07:53,630
Oh, that's what it is.

5138
03:07:53,630 --> 03:07:54,130
It's a llama.

5139
03:07:56,810 --> 03:07:57,110
Yeah.

5140
03:07:57,430 --> 03:07:59,730
It's a llama, so it has to be part of the structure.

5141
03:08:00,970 --> 03:08:03,370
To kill the number one player that makes you number one?

5142
03:08:03,490 --> 03:08:05,450
Yeah, that should be the case.

5143
03:08:05,650 --> 03:08:05,890
It's true.

5144
03:08:06,510 --> 03:08:08,490
Oh shit, they knew he was in the bush.

5145
03:08:09,030 --> 03:08:09,870
So smart.

5146
03:08:11,590 --> 03:08:14,490
Once you play the game long enough, you eventually just never trust bushes.

5147
03:08:16,010 --> 03:08:17,710
You're like, I hate bushes.

5148
03:08:19,370 --> 03:08:21,330
Oh, that's the number one player, I think.

5149
03:08:21,630 --> 03:08:22,130
Which one?

5150
03:08:22,670 --> 03:08:23,970
The one that just died.

5151
03:08:24,250 --> 03:08:25,830
Oh yeah, fuck that guy.

5152
03:08:26,110 --> 03:08:27,290
I'm watching the...

5153
03:08:27,290 --> 03:08:29,710
I should not give the condom people views.

5154
03:08:30,130 --> 03:08:31,350
I'm watching the...

5155
03:08:33,510 --> 03:08:35,070
I'm watching the plunger people.

5156
03:08:35,510 --> 03:08:38,010
I'm watching a grandma team right now.

5157
03:08:38,250 --> 03:08:39,870
Oh my god, they're growing trees.

5158
03:08:40,230 --> 03:08:41,110
They're planting a tree.

5159
03:08:46,500 --> 03:08:48,300
The item shop just refreshed?

5160
03:08:48,680 --> 03:08:50,880
Thank you for the real updates that I care about.

5161
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:51,760
Hey yo.

5162
03:08:54,660 --> 03:08:55,740
What's in the item shop?

5163
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:56,680
Are there any cool emotes?

5164
03:08:58,460 --> 03:09:00,400
The thing I actually care about.

5165
03:09:06,440 --> 03:09:06,920
Oh?

5166
03:09:08,540 --> 03:09:10,600
I'm watching a red-headed team.

5167
03:09:10,700 --> 03:09:12,080
I'm watching the plunger team.

5168
03:09:12,360 --> 03:09:13,340
They have the plunger gun.

5169
03:09:14,320 --> 03:09:16,260
They're the ones that has a push.

5170
03:09:17,140 --> 03:09:18,240
Oh, the guys with the push!

5171
03:09:18,240 --> 03:09:20,600
I think these guys have won a bunch.

5172
03:09:20,840 --> 03:09:22,320
They've won like two games back to back.

5173
03:09:22,520 --> 03:09:23,040
Did they?

5174
03:09:23,280 --> 03:09:23,880
I can't tell.

5175
03:09:23,980 --> 03:09:24,680
They're all the same.

5176
03:09:25,940 --> 03:09:28,460
They're all the fucking same to me.

5177
03:09:28,820 --> 03:09:30,120
They're all on novice mode.

5178
03:09:31,100 --> 03:09:33,560
Get off of novice mode, you fucking pussies!

5179
03:09:34,580 --> 03:09:36,260
Who's stream-styping you?

5180
03:09:36,620 --> 03:09:36,900
Who?

5181
03:09:37,800 --> 03:09:38,860
I'm telling you.

5182
03:09:39,260 --> 03:09:41,920
You're literally the voice of the people.

5183
03:09:45,740 --> 03:09:47,260
Oh, they're getting pushed by a condom.

5184
03:09:47,500 --> 03:09:47,900
Oh, they're getting pushed by a condom.

5185
03:09:47,900 --> 03:09:48,400
On 5 HP.

5186
03:09:50,120 --> 03:09:51,820
Oh, they got on a condom.

5187
03:09:53,600 --> 03:09:55,120
I'm watching the grandma team again.

5188
03:09:57,620 --> 03:09:58,600
Oh, the grandmas are dying.

5189
03:09:59,340 --> 03:10:00,960
Oh god, not the grannies.

5190
03:10:01,500 --> 03:10:02,900
No, let the grannies live.

5191
03:10:04,560 --> 03:10:06,060
Oh, the granny team's dead.

5192
03:10:06,220 --> 03:10:07,120
To a condom again.

5193
03:10:07,760 --> 03:10:08,200
Oh shit.

5194
03:10:08,200 --> 03:10:10,940
It's like redheads versus condoms.

5195
03:10:11,480 --> 03:10:12,760
And just one guy.

5196
03:10:13,040 --> 03:10:13,680
Just one solo.

5197
03:10:14,200 --> 03:10:16,300
That out of context sounds so good.

5198
03:10:20,400 --> 03:10:21,880
Oh my god.

5199
03:10:25,980 --> 03:10:27,520
Oh, big brain.

5200
03:10:28,060 --> 03:10:28,980
Oh, but they're dead.

5201
03:10:30,320 --> 03:10:32,080
My god, this guy's level 445?

5202
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:36,920
That's a Fortnite player right there.

5203
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:37,440
What is this guy?

5204
03:10:37,500 --> 03:10:37,940
Level 167.

5205
03:10:38,560 --> 03:10:40,120
I'm watching somebody that's...

5206
03:10:40,120 --> 03:10:41,500
I'm watching Feast right now.

5207
03:10:41,680 --> 03:10:43,280
Isn't he an OG Fortnite player?

5208
03:10:44,440 --> 03:10:44,880
Oh, who is?

5209
03:10:45,300 --> 03:10:45,780
Feast.

5210
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:46,920
Oh, Feast?

5211
03:10:50,080 --> 03:10:50,700
Everyone's a no.

5212
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:51,740
I can't even spectate them.

5213
03:10:52,080 --> 03:10:52,460
No!

5214
03:10:55,520 --> 03:10:56,360
It's okay.

5215
03:10:56,560 --> 03:10:58,020
Get out of my screen.

5216
03:10:58,820 --> 03:11:01,860
I'm not even gonna watch you dance.

5217
03:11:03,860 --> 03:11:04,640
Oh, he said Feast.

5218
03:11:04,700 --> 03:11:05,220
I'm so dumb.

5219
03:11:05,340 --> 03:11:06,200
I thought he said Feast.

5220
03:11:06,960 --> 03:11:07,640
No, no.

5221
03:11:07,800 --> 03:11:09,260
T-H-I-E-F-S.

5222
03:11:09,500 --> 03:11:11,080
Yeah, Feast is actually really good.

5223
03:11:11,460 --> 03:11:13,600
He's like one of the players I knew when I saw the list.

5224
03:11:13,600 --> 03:11:16,020
We want your feedback on a scale from 1 to 10.

5225
03:11:16,120 --> 03:11:17,700
How would you rate 1?

5226
03:11:18,500 --> 03:11:20,640
I strongly disliked it because the condoms won.

5227
03:11:21,220 --> 03:11:22,020
Negative 69.

5228
03:11:23,880 --> 03:11:25,720
Alright, let's play one game.

5229
03:11:26,200 --> 03:11:28,460
Oh my god, we get to play a normal game!

5230
03:11:28,840 --> 03:11:29,280
Let's go!

5231
03:11:30,700 --> 03:11:31,920
I wanna be Mr. Beast.

5232
03:11:32,040 --> 03:11:33,100
No, I wanna be John Cena.

5233
03:11:33,100 --> 03:11:34,400
I'm gonna be John Cena.

5234
03:11:35,540 --> 03:11:36,400
Who do I play as?

5235
03:11:37,700 --> 03:11:38,860
Play as you dream.

5236
03:11:39,180 --> 03:11:39,720
As content.

5237
03:11:40,280 --> 03:11:43,100
Let me play as...

5238
03:11:44,120 --> 03:11:46,760
I can be a big cat man.

5239
03:11:47,540 --> 03:11:48,160
Alright, let's see.

5240
03:11:48,240 --> 03:11:49,860
John Cena with the pom-poms.

5241
03:11:50,120 --> 03:11:50,400
Yeah!

5242
03:11:51,820 --> 03:11:52,940
John Cena.

5243
03:11:53,160 --> 03:11:53,900
I'm gonna be a person.

5244
03:11:54,340 --> 03:11:54,680
Oh, you're right.

5245
03:11:54,740 --> 03:11:55,680
Thanks for the reminder again.

5246
03:11:55,720 --> 03:11:56,000
I forgot.

5247
03:11:56,320 --> 03:11:56,840
Oh!

5248
03:11:57,720 --> 03:11:58,940
Oh my god!

5249
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:00,620
Will, the song singer!

5250
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:03,280
They added so many emotes.

5251
03:12:03,340 --> 03:12:05,640
Oh my god, they added emotes that matter to me.

5252
03:12:07,820 --> 03:12:08,620
What's this?

5253
03:12:10,300 --> 03:12:10,640
Oh!

5254
03:12:11,700 --> 03:12:13,120
Let him go!

5255
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:14,480
Let John Cena go!

5256
03:12:15,540 --> 03:12:17,000
Oh my god!

5257
03:12:17,720 --> 03:12:18,880
Oh my god!

5258
03:12:19,960 --> 03:12:21,960
Alright, wake up.

5259
03:12:22,080 --> 03:12:22,520
What's this?

5260
03:12:24,300 --> 03:12:26,100
Alright, I know which one I want.

5261
03:12:26,180 --> 03:12:27,040
I know exactly.

5262
03:12:27,260 --> 03:12:28,140
Okay, Pirates of the Caribbean.

5263
03:12:28,600 --> 03:12:30,480
Okay, they did not refresh these.

5264
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:32,260
Oh, what the fuck?

5265
03:12:32,280 --> 03:12:33,120
Is that a monkey?

5266
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:35,380
Ayo?

5267
03:12:35,560 --> 03:12:36,080
Wait, what?

5268
03:12:36,220 --> 03:12:37,440
Oh, I didn't see the rest of the shop.

5269
03:12:37,900 --> 03:12:39,380
There's like a monkey.

5270
03:12:43,480 --> 03:12:44,280
Is that it?

5271
03:12:44,480 --> 03:12:45,780
Oh, the stock monkey!

5272
03:12:45,940 --> 03:12:46,340
Yeah!

5273
03:12:47,500 --> 03:12:48,320
There's a monkey.

5274
03:12:50,140 --> 03:12:50,900
So ugly.

5275
03:12:52,960 --> 03:12:55,180
Okay, I know exactly what I'm gonna buy.

5276
03:13:00,080 --> 03:13:01,180
Oh my god.

5277
03:13:02,620 --> 03:13:05,400
Okay, so we are playing tomorrow for sure, I guess.

5278
03:13:05,520 --> 03:13:05,660
Yeah.

5279
03:13:06,800 --> 03:13:09,280
Dang, look at us.

5280
03:13:09,540 --> 03:13:10,620
We made it through day two.

5281
03:13:10,720 --> 03:13:12,960
We fucking did it.

5282
03:13:13,300 --> 03:13:15,680
We made it through the day.

5283
03:13:16,140 --> 03:13:18,080
Alright, I got new emotes.

5284
03:13:18,820 --> 03:13:19,380
Let's see.

5285
03:13:20,520 --> 03:13:21,900
Let's see, where is...

5286
03:13:21,900 --> 03:13:23,560
I wanna see what the standings were for the end.

5287
03:13:25,400 --> 03:13:27,500
Did that one point matter to us?

5288
03:13:27,500 --> 03:13:28,640
Did it?

5289
03:13:28,880 --> 03:13:35,100
I wonder if we actually got more points than the other teams that were ahead of us.

5290
03:13:35,220 --> 03:13:37,120
They were only ahead of us by like two points.

5291
03:13:37,400 --> 03:13:38,480
You're a duck!

5292
03:13:42,660 --> 03:13:44,080
Oh my god.

5293
03:13:47,020 --> 03:13:48,400
This is what I bought.

5294
03:13:49,740 --> 03:13:50,560
Oh, you have that one.

5295
03:13:50,920 --> 03:13:51,620
Yeah, fine.

5296
03:13:53,860 --> 03:13:55,200
Let's call it Gunslinger, right?

5297
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:56,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5298
03:13:56,860 --> 03:13:57,560
Pew, pew.

5299
03:14:00,500 --> 03:14:02,220
And I have this too.

5300
03:14:02,820 --> 03:14:04,880
Oh, look at him go.

5301
03:14:06,720 --> 03:14:07,860
Look at him go.

5302
03:14:08,020 --> 03:14:09,200
Go, Cena, go.

5303
03:14:10,920 --> 03:14:12,780
Show those moves.

5304
03:14:13,220 --> 03:14:14,460
Oh, don't see what's going on.

5305
03:14:14,620 --> 03:14:15,780
Look at him go.

5306
03:14:16,540 --> 03:14:18,320
Go, Cena, go.

5307
03:14:18,880 --> 03:14:20,760
I forgot to ready up.

5308
03:14:21,900 --> 03:14:23,260
Oh, I forgot about that.

5309
03:14:23,260 --> 03:14:25,940
I forgot about the actual part of the game.

5310
03:14:28,140 --> 03:14:30,540
No, we're playing the game right now.

5311
03:14:30,660 --> 03:14:32,920
Oh my god, now we can actually play the game.

5312
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:33,380
Wait, okay.

5313
03:14:34,740 --> 03:14:36,420
Oh my god, what would it look like?

5314
03:14:37,160 --> 03:14:38,300
I'm proud of us.

5315
03:14:38,380 --> 03:14:40,080
We got 13th on our last game.

5316
03:14:40,180 --> 03:14:41,080
Yeah, we improve.

5317
03:14:41,300 --> 03:14:42,580
We're consistently improving.

5318
03:14:43,140 --> 03:14:44,140
That's all that matters.

5319
03:14:44,880 --> 03:14:51,980
One of my really, really goated Fortnite buddies was like, I know 90% of that lobby list, and you guys did really good.

5320
03:14:53,600 --> 03:14:54,500
You know what?

5321
03:14:54,580 --> 03:14:55,720
That's all that matters.

5322
03:14:56,940 --> 03:14:58,240
I told you!

5323
03:14:58,760 --> 03:15:00,040
My bodyguard!

5324
03:15:01,900 --> 03:15:05,580
I told you I'd block all the bullets with my big body.

5325
03:15:06,100 --> 03:15:07,540
We did it!

5326
03:15:08,680 --> 03:15:10,860
I'm not fluffy for any other reason.

5327
03:15:11,500 --> 03:15:13,000
We got our bodyguard.

5328
03:15:13,820 --> 03:15:14,380
Mixxy!

5329
03:15:14,960 --> 03:15:16,020
Hello, Mixxy.

5330
03:15:16,180 --> 03:15:16,580
Yeah, I know.

5331
03:15:16,880 --> 03:15:19,320
We're continuing on the trend of condom skins.

5332
03:15:22,040 --> 03:15:22,520
Alright.

5333
03:15:22,880 --> 03:15:23,360
Nice!

5334
03:15:23,620 --> 03:15:25,000
Oh my god, I get to actually play the game.

5335
03:15:25,160 --> 03:15:26,880
I get to actually play the game.

5336
03:15:26,980 --> 03:15:32,140
Holy shit, I swear to god, if I see a fucking bunker person, I'm going straight up to them and shotgunning them in the face.

5337
03:15:32,500 --> 03:15:34,440
Yeah, let's fucking go!

5338
03:15:34,460 --> 03:15:37,080
I feel like I played against Fortnite pros today.

5339
03:15:37,180 --> 03:15:38,440
You don't matter to me.

5340
03:15:38,600 --> 03:15:39,400
You are nothing.

5341
03:15:39,880 --> 03:15:41,260
You're beneath us.

5342
03:15:43,540 --> 03:15:45,480
Oh my god, you have pom-poms!

5343
03:15:45,720 --> 03:15:46,400
I do.

5344
03:15:47,100 --> 03:15:48,580
You're all beneath me.

5345
03:15:48,580 --> 03:15:51,260
I fucking played against Fortnite pros.

5346
03:15:52,400 --> 03:15:54,840
Who carried ten buildings.

5347
03:16:00,480 --> 03:16:04,660
Who is this loser with thirty- fifty-eight crowns?

5348
03:16:04,740 --> 03:16:05,660
Get out of here!

5349
03:16:06,060 --> 03:16:09,180
Get the fuck out of here!

5350
03:16:09,420 --> 03:16:11,020
Fifty-eight crowns, you loser!

5351
03:16:11,020 --> 03:16:11,200
Get out of here!

5352
03:16:16,640 --> 03:16:18,560
That's fucking right, my crown.

5353
03:16:19,260 --> 03:16:19,720
Damn.

5354
03:16:21,080 --> 03:16:21,600
Damn.

5355
03:16:22,820 --> 03:16:23,940
They were like, nah.

5356
03:16:24,600 --> 03:16:25,080
Nah.

5357
03:16:26,860 --> 03:16:28,140
Alright, I'm ready.

5358
03:16:28,760 --> 03:16:29,580
Alright, where do you want to go?

5359
03:16:29,640 --> 03:16:30,580
Where do you feel like going?

5360
03:16:31,580 --> 03:16:32,620
I don't know.

5361
03:16:35,320 --> 03:16:36,620
You have railways.

5362
03:16:36,760 --> 03:16:37,460
Let's fucking do it.

5363
03:16:37,460 --> 03:16:37,940
Railways.

5364
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:41,420
You see that icon on the map?

5365
03:16:41,620 --> 03:16:41,780
The skull?

5366
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,300
That's like the best medallion in the game.

5367
03:16:45,400 --> 03:16:46,860
And it randomly spawned over here.

5368
03:16:46,940 --> 03:16:48,400
So we have like a hell of people here.

5369
03:16:48,480 --> 03:16:49,160
Holy shit.

5370
03:16:49,940 --> 03:16:51,200
We can kill them, right?

5371
03:16:52,600 --> 03:16:59,380
Oh my god, why are my frames dropping like crazy for this area?

5372
03:17:00,380 --> 03:17:01,340
Holy shit!

5373
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:04,720
What the fuck?

5374
03:17:04,720 --> 03:17:06,960
I destroyed the first spot!

5375
03:17:09,700 --> 03:17:12,180
It's not even coming to us!

5376
03:17:14,660 --> 03:17:15,980
I killed one!

5377
03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:18,240
Come on, I'm with you.

5378
03:17:19,660 --> 03:17:20,700
I'm scared.

5379
03:17:21,400 --> 03:17:22,220
Freaking die!

5380
03:17:23,080 --> 03:17:23,600
I killed one.

5381
03:17:23,620 --> 03:17:24,260
We're good, we're good.

5382
03:17:24,460 --> 03:17:25,300
Wait, is there loot on you?

5383
03:17:26,240 --> 03:17:27,520
There should be, yeah.

5384
03:17:28,820 --> 03:17:30,580
Okay, I'm just gonna head to you.

5385
03:17:30,940 --> 03:17:31,900
Knock knock!

5386
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:34,120
John Cena, he's here.

5387
03:17:34,400 --> 03:17:35,340
John Cena!

5388
03:17:35,960 --> 03:17:37,900
And his name is...

5389
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:39,320
Oh?

5390
03:17:39,800 --> 03:17:40,960
I got ammo.

5391
03:17:44,310 --> 03:17:45,330
Oh, they ran.

5392
03:17:45,470 --> 03:17:46,470
Okay, well...

5393
03:17:46,470 --> 03:17:49,350
What the fuck is this?

5394
03:17:50,010 --> 03:17:51,530
I have Nitro Splash.

5395
03:17:51,850 --> 03:17:52,250
Is there a gun?

5396
03:17:53,410 --> 03:17:54,930
And then here's the ammo.

5397
03:17:55,450 --> 03:17:56,290
Nice, okay.

5398
03:17:57,370 --> 03:18:01,130
And then once you're done popping those, stand next to me and I'm gonna hit these canisters here.

5399
03:18:01,130 --> 03:18:02,650
Okay, I'm just gonna grab this gun.

5400
03:18:03,030 --> 03:18:04,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're good.

5401
03:18:04,830 --> 03:18:05,710
And this too.

5402
03:18:06,190 --> 03:18:06,750
Alright, I'm good.

5403
03:18:07,350 --> 03:18:08,650
What the fuck is this gun that you got me?

5404
03:18:08,810 --> 03:18:09,950
Flint Knock Pistol.

5405
03:18:10,270 --> 03:18:10,450
Okay.

5406
03:18:11,150 --> 03:18:11,450
I'm ready.

5407
03:18:11,490 --> 03:18:12,990
Okay, so let's hit these.

5408
03:18:14,570 --> 03:18:16,830
And then I'm gonna do this and you can run forever.

5409
03:18:17,270 --> 03:18:17,630
There you go.

5410
03:18:17,710 --> 03:18:18,270
Oh, shit!

5411
03:18:19,370 --> 03:18:19,750
Oh!

5412
03:18:21,710 --> 03:18:23,530
JustDV, get shit on!

5413
03:18:24,690 --> 03:18:25,090
Yeah!

5414
03:18:25,270 --> 03:18:26,090
This team's dead!

5415
03:18:26,230 --> 03:18:27,790
Oh my god, what the fuck is happening?

5416
03:18:27,970 --> 03:18:29,130
Oh, get fucking...

5417
03:18:29,810 --> 03:18:30,350
Where are you?

5418
03:18:30,350 --> 03:18:30,850
I'm alive somewhere.

5419
03:18:30,930 --> 03:18:31,750
Where the fuck are you?

5420
03:18:31,990 --> 03:18:33,550
Where the fuck are you?

5421
03:18:35,150 --> 03:18:36,150
It's a Peabody!

5422
03:18:36,510 --> 03:18:37,370
Where is the Peas?

5423
03:18:37,430 --> 03:18:37,890
Where is he?

5424
03:18:40,710 --> 03:18:41,390
Oh, god.

5425
03:18:41,770 --> 03:18:42,190
You guys won?

5426
03:18:42,930 --> 03:18:44,230
Oh, I'm pushing him.

5427
03:18:45,230 --> 03:18:46,130
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

5428
03:18:47,910 --> 03:18:49,050
I'm going in, I'm going in.

5429
03:18:51,490 --> 03:18:52,450
I got lost.

5430
03:18:52,830 --> 03:18:53,710
There's too many doors.

5431
03:18:54,450 --> 03:18:56,010
How do I get out of this house?

5432
03:18:56,010 --> 03:18:57,350
Life has too many doors.

5433
03:18:57,810 --> 03:18:59,010
How do I get out?

5434
03:19:00,190 --> 03:19:01,310
Fuck away, chest!

5435
03:19:02,090 --> 03:19:02,770
We're alive!

5436
03:19:02,950 --> 03:19:03,470
We're good!

5437
03:19:03,670 --> 03:19:04,370
We're good, we're good.

5438
03:19:04,490 --> 03:19:05,190
Everything's fine.

5439
03:19:06,010 --> 03:19:07,770
I don't know what guns I'm holding, but everything's fine.

5440
03:19:07,770 --> 03:19:09,850
Oh, you're not like... You're like owning right now.

5441
03:19:09,870 --> 03:19:11,690
We just fucking own some humans.

5442
03:19:12,610 --> 03:19:13,750
Yeah, that's right.

5443
03:19:14,290 --> 03:19:15,650
Get fucking shit on!

5444
03:19:16,770 --> 03:19:18,170
I need this.

5445
03:19:18,730 --> 03:19:19,350
Can I eat my apple?

5446
03:19:20,730 --> 03:19:21,750
Oh, I'm gonna break in.

5447
03:19:21,790 --> 03:19:22,730
I'm gonna steal some gold.

5448
03:19:23,410 --> 03:19:24,050
I'm gonna steal...

5449
03:19:24,050 --> 03:19:25,390
Ooh, I'm gonna steal a cabbage.

5450
03:19:25,870 --> 03:19:29,150
Do you need any like...

5451
03:19:29,150 --> 03:19:30,410
ammo for your flintlock?

5452
03:19:30,550 --> 03:19:31,190
No, I'm good.

5453
03:19:32,730 --> 03:19:34,390
How many bullets do I have?

5454
03:19:34,450 --> 03:19:35,570
Is this one shot?

5455
03:19:36,090 --> 03:19:38,650
Yeah, it's like a one shot, but it acts kind of like a shotgun.

5456
03:19:39,050 --> 03:19:40,850
And it also launches you into the air.

5457
03:19:41,190 --> 03:19:42,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's what I felt.

5458
03:19:42,870 --> 03:19:44,050
I was like, what the fuck?

5459
03:19:44,570 --> 03:19:46,290
Was that what was happening when you were fighting him?

5460
03:19:46,310 --> 03:19:47,310
Yeah, I was like fighting him.

5461
03:19:51,430 --> 03:19:52,430
That's fucking right.

5462
03:19:52,430 --> 03:19:53,350
Knocked one.

5463
03:19:53,590 --> 03:19:54,690
Nice, get over here.

5464
03:19:55,990 --> 03:19:57,290
That's fucking right.

5465
03:19:57,730 --> 03:19:58,430
Get out.

5466
03:20:01,570 --> 03:20:02,310
Where is he?

5467
03:20:02,790 --> 03:20:03,950
I cracked his kite.

5468
03:20:05,190 --> 03:20:06,070
No, I missed!

5469
03:20:06,490 --> 03:20:07,250
They're dead!

5470
03:20:08,090 --> 03:20:09,730
That's why I was like, no.

5471
03:20:10,590 --> 03:20:11,710
I'm gonna try shockwaves.

5472
03:20:12,330 --> 03:20:13,970
There we go.

5473
03:20:14,270 --> 03:20:18,310
Oh my god, I'm actually one HP.

5474
03:20:18,830 --> 03:20:20,430
Holy shit, I have cabbages.

5475
03:20:22,430 --> 03:20:23,170
You want cabbages?

5476
03:20:23,510 --> 03:20:24,690
Yeah, yeah, don't make it count.

5477
03:20:24,850 --> 03:20:26,970
Okay, here's some cabbages.

5478
03:20:27,510 --> 03:20:29,210
Thank you, Doncino, you're my favorite.

5479
03:20:29,370 --> 03:20:30,950
Don't worry, I'm here to feed you.

5480
03:20:31,450 --> 03:20:34,810
Don't worry, little duck, I'm gonna feed you some cabbages at the lake.

5481
03:20:37,210 --> 03:20:38,290
Alright, let's go to the left.

5482
03:20:39,170 --> 03:20:39,970
Alright, I'm fucking going.

5483
03:20:41,610 --> 03:20:43,610
I'm feeding some ducks at the pond.

5484
03:20:44,190 --> 03:20:45,270
We are fucking owning.

5485
03:20:45,650 --> 03:20:46,930
Way better than these guys could own.

5486
03:20:47,830 --> 03:20:48,570
Yeah, that's right.

5487
03:20:48,570 --> 03:20:48,610
Okay.

5488
03:20:50,390 --> 03:20:51,830
Alright, let's keep going left.

5489
03:20:52,110 --> 03:20:53,050
This is a shotgun.

5490
03:20:53,670 --> 03:20:56,150
Run and gun harbinger SMG.

5491
03:20:56,310 --> 03:20:56,890
Is that good?

5492
03:20:57,610 --> 03:20:58,510
Uh, the harbinger?

5493
03:20:58,670 --> 03:20:59,930
Yeah, what color is it?

5494
03:21:00,050 --> 03:21:00,370
Green.

5495
03:21:01,350 --> 03:21:02,150
Yeah, it's not too bad.

5496
03:21:02,530 --> 03:21:04,850
It got like crazy buffed.

5497
03:21:04,850 --> 03:21:06,410
I think like a few patches ago.

5498
03:21:09,070 --> 03:21:11,430
Oh my god, I'm listening to Twitch Rivals in the background.

5499
03:21:11,890 --> 03:21:13,210
I have the nitro splash.

5500
03:21:14,190 --> 03:21:15,010
Oh, you have nitro splash?

5501
03:21:15,010 --> 03:21:16,570
Is that the...

5502
03:21:16,570 --> 03:21:18,590
That's the one that you splashed on me, right?

5503
03:21:19,150 --> 03:21:21,470
Yeah, that gives you like um...

5504
03:21:21,470 --> 03:21:23,130
infinite sprinting.

5505
03:21:23,210 --> 03:21:23,970
Oh, okay.

5506
03:21:24,490 --> 03:21:25,610
Here, I'll give it to you.

5507
03:21:26,090 --> 03:21:28,170
No, no, you should use it.

5508
03:21:29,130 --> 03:21:30,510
I don't know what I'm doing.

5509
03:21:30,990 --> 03:21:33,690
All you gotta do is use it and then you start going really fast.

5510
03:21:34,390 --> 03:21:35,590
I can split it with you.

5511
03:21:35,790 --> 03:21:37,430
There you go.

5512
03:21:38,170 --> 03:21:39,830
Alright, sweet.

5513
03:21:40,090 --> 03:21:41,870
I'm gonna pop it and we can start sprinting.

5514
03:21:41,870 --> 03:21:42,610
Alright.

5515
03:21:43,930 --> 03:21:45,370
Let's fucking go!

5516
03:21:45,970 --> 03:21:48,610
Oh my god, you destroyed a fucking bush!

5517
03:21:48,990 --> 03:21:50,590
Yeah, you can literally just run through stuff.

5518
03:21:50,790 --> 03:21:51,410
You like break everything.

5519
03:21:51,410 --> 03:21:52,110
Can I run through this?

5520
03:21:52,730 --> 03:21:53,990
Oh shit!

5521
03:21:55,550 --> 03:21:56,990
John Cena's here!

5522
03:22:02,250 --> 03:22:03,290
Holy shit!

5523
03:22:03,830 --> 03:22:04,710
That's crazy.

5524
03:22:05,010 --> 03:22:06,390
Oh no, I don't have it anymore.

5525
03:22:06,390 --> 03:22:08,450
It's going left for like, I think, what is it?

5526
03:22:08,510 --> 03:22:08,970
10 seconds?

5527
03:22:09,170 --> 03:22:10,310
I think it's like 10 seconds.

5528
03:22:10,330 --> 03:22:11,130
Wait, somebody's here.

5529
03:22:11,250 --> 03:22:11,910
I hear footsteps.

5530
03:22:12,430 --> 03:22:13,370
Oh yeah, that might be them.

5531
03:22:15,170 --> 03:22:16,190
Run me, run me.

5532
03:22:16,750 --> 03:22:17,810
I ran too far.

5533
03:22:19,430 --> 03:22:20,190
I cracked one.

5534
03:22:20,390 --> 03:22:20,750
Nice.

5535
03:22:20,990 --> 03:22:25,070
I cracked the other guy.

5536
03:22:25,150 --> 03:22:25,550
I knocked him.

5537
03:22:26,030 --> 03:22:27,330
Where is he?

5538
03:22:27,430 --> 03:22:27,930
They're dead!

5539
03:22:28,090 --> 03:22:28,950
There's another vehicle here.

5540
03:22:29,730 --> 03:22:30,090
Nice.

5541
03:22:31,310 --> 03:22:32,470
Alright, give me your shit.

5542
03:22:32,470 --> 03:22:33,450
Oh my god.

5543
03:22:33,570 --> 03:22:34,650
Give me your shit.

5544
03:22:34,910 --> 03:22:37,490
Give me your fucking shit.

5545
03:22:37,610 --> 03:22:39,290
What is this?

5546
03:22:39,610 --> 03:22:42,150
What did you throw at me?

5547
03:22:42,470 --> 03:22:42,990
What the fuck?

5548
03:22:43,750 --> 03:22:45,450
I'm going to swap my flint gun.

5549
03:22:45,550 --> 03:22:46,390
I don't want it anymore.

5550
03:22:46,490 --> 03:22:47,670
I'm done playing with you.

5551
03:22:49,390 --> 03:22:50,870
I don't want to play with you anymore.

5552
03:22:53,470 --> 03:22:54,830
I got a sniper now.

5553
03:22:55,370 --> 03:22:57,570
I cannot wait to find the movement item of the season.

5554
03:22:57,890 --> 03:22:59,770
Because you're going to be like, what the fuck, League of Legends?

5555
03:22:59,770 --> 03:23:00,610
What?

5556
03:23:01,270 --> 03:23:02,510
Have you ever played League before?

5557
03:23:02,910 --> 03:23:03,130
No.

5558
03:23:05,630 --> 03:23:07,150
I still have a life.

5559
03:23:12,910 --> 03:23:13,790
Tell him.

5560
03:23:17,350 --> 03:23:18,490
Get in here.

5561
03:23:18,630 --> 03:23:20,570
We're going to go for a little drive.

5562
03:23:22,290 --> 03:23:23,370
I'm heading over.

5563
03:23:23,930 --> 03:23:24,830
You're going to drive your own car?

5564
03:23:25,270 --> 03:23:26,050
I'm next to you.

5565
03:23:26,050 --> 03:23:26,870
Wait, you're right.

5566
03:23:27,670 --> 03:23:28,990
Where did he go?

5567
03:23:29,710 --> 03:23:30,910
Where did he go?

5568
03:23:32,590 --> 03:23:34,290
What the fuck happened here?

5569
03:23:34,390 --> 03:23:35,130
Look, it's all broken.

5570
03:23:35,390 --> 03:23:35,990
Wait, you're right.

5571
03:23:36,070 --> 03:23:36,830
What the fuck?

5572
03:23:38,770 --> 03:23:39,770
There's people fighting.

5573
03:23:39,930 --> 03:23:40,630
They have the medallion.

5574
03:23:42,890 --> 03:23:46,470
We don't have any movement other than our infinite nitros.

5575
03:23:46,790 --> 03:23:48,250
That's enough movement for us.

5576
03:23:48,390 --> 03:23:49,170
We're going to kill you.

5577
03:23:49,850 --> 03:23:50,910
We're going to go to them.

5578
03:23:51,210 --> 03:23:52,150
We ain't no pussies.

5579
03:23:52,150 --> 03:23:54,150
Yeah, we don't have anomalous mode on.

5580
03:23:54,210 --> 03:23:55,430
That's when you know we're gamers.

5581
03:23:55,890 --> 03:23:57,130
I'm going to get out of here.

5582
03:23:57,830 --> 03:23:58,630
Get out of the car.

5583
03:24:01,750 --> 03:24:03,730
Sorry for calling you pussies.

5584
03:24:04,110 --> 03:24:04,690
They're right here.

5585
03:24:05,410 --> 03:24:07,350
We're going to kill these dudes.

5586
03:24:09,330 --> 03:24:10,870
He's fucking running.

5587
03:24:11,710 --> 03:24:12,750
Stop running, bitch.

5588
03:24:18,180 --> 03:24:19,680
Oh my god.

5589
03:24:22,200 --> 03:24:23,240
I'm going to reload.

5590
03:24:23,680 --> 03:24:24,000
I'm going to reload.

5591
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:24,300
We're good.

5592
03:24:25,700 --> 03:24:27,900
I don't have an angle on them.

5593
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:34,660
There's people behind us.

5594
03:24:34,860 --> 03:24:35,740
There's people behind us.

5595
03:24:36,120 --> 03:24:36,960
Oh shit.

5596
03:24:37,100 --> 03:24:38,100
They're gloving away.

5597
03:24:38,880 --> 03:24:40,840
I might be fucked then.

5598
03:24:41,560 --> 03:24:42,140
We're good.

5599
03:24:42,800 --> 03:24:45,040
I'm going to run back the way we came.

5600
03:24:45,900 --> 03:24:46,200
Okay.

5601
03:24:46,200 --> 03:24:48,200
Because I might...

5602
03:24:49,820 --> 03:24:50,020
I'm looking.

5603
03:24:50,320 --> 03:24:50,720
Help me.

5604
03:24:52,080 --> 03:24:53,460
Oh, he's so low.

5605
03:24:53,860 --> 03:24:54,200
I knocked him.

5606
03:24:55,840 --> 03:24:56,820
Where's his buddy?

5607
03:24:58,060 --> 03:24:58,960
I'm going to come to you.

5608
03:24:59,360 --> 03:25:00,740
John Cena's going to live.

5609
03:25:02,760 --> 03:25:04,560
John Cena did not live.

5610
03:25:05,440 --> 03:25:05,820
They're dead.

5611
03:25:05,820 --> 03:25:06,840
Pick me up.

5612
03:25:07,120 --> 03:25:10,940
I have bandages on me.

5613
03:25:10,940 --> 03:25:14,120
Oh no.

5614
03:25:14,480 --> 03:25:15,500
John Cena, please.

5615
03:25:16,140 --> 03:25:18,180
I need to be the people's champion.

5616
03:25:19,440 --> 03:25:19,960
Okay, we're good.

5617
03:25:20,240 --> 03:25:21,320
You can heal.

5618
03:25:22,280 --> 03:25:23,660
I have bandages.

5619
03:25:24,560 --> 03:25:24,740
Okay.

5620
03:25:26,860 --> 03:25:28,300
I'm going to toss you one.

5621
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:29,900
Yeah, I'm going to catch it.

5622
03:25:29,980 --> 03:25:30,560
It's like baseball.

5623
03:25:31,620 --> 03:25:32,440
Where is it?

5624
03:25:34,200 --> 03:25:35,860
Oh my god, it's so far.

5625
03:25:36,820 --> 03:25:39,080
I'm going to toss you a big shield.

5626
03:25:39,080 --> 03:25:40,360
Okay, got it.

5627
03:25:40,420 --> 03:25:41,200
After you're done.

5628
03:25:43,820 --> 03:25:45,180
Oh my god, we're alive.

5629
03:25:45,300 --> 03:25:47,020
We're still healthy.

5630
03:25:47,220 --> 03:25:47,860
Oh, they're shooting.

5631
03:25:48,060 --> 03:25:49,560
They're still shooting.

5632
03:25:49,900 --> 03:25:52,160
We can full top off over here.

5633
03:25:52,380 --> 03:25:54,080
Let's go back over to the train station.

5634
03:25:54,840 --> 03:25:56,680
And then we're going to top off.

5635
03:25:56,900 --> 03:25:57,360
Let's go.

5636
03:25:57,980 --> 03:25:58,860
Let's fucking go.

5637
03:26:00,060 --> 03:26:02,700
John Cena wants to eat everything.

5638
03:26:02,980 --> 03:26:03,380
I think.

5639
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:05,720
By the way, this is legal.

5640
03:26:05,720 --> 03:26:07,200
I'm drinking legal stuff.

5641
03:26:08,800 --> 03:26:10,340
Oh shit, we're out of bigs here.

5642
03:26:10,460 --> 03:26:11,620
I have heals.

5643
03:26:11,740 --> 03:26:12,500
I have gold.

5644
03:26:13,100 --> 03:26:13,440
Oh, you do?

5645
03:26:14,220 --> 03:26:17,220
Oh, it's out of stock.

5646
03:26:17,360 --> 03:26:19,720
Oh, I thought you meant like...

5647
03:26:21,220 --> 03:26:21,620
That's...

5648
03:26:21,620 --> 03:26:23,300
Yeah, I was going to buy...

5649
03:26:23,300 --> 03:26:24,500
See, you call them shield bats too.

5650
03:26:24,600 --> 03:26:25,620
I fucking call them shield bats.

5651
03:26:27,260 --> 03:26:28,380
Oh, they're coming over.

5652
03:26:30,660 --> 03:26:31,760
What the fuck?

5653
03:26:32,040 --> 03:26:32,720
Are they driving you?

5654
03:26:32,720 --> 03:26:34,020
Yeah, they're shooting.

5655
03:26:34,140 --> 03:26:35,680
They have a machine gun on top.

5656
03:26:36,220 --> 03:26:37,960
Oh, they're going to keep running, I think.

5657
03:26:39,640 --> 03:26:41,160
What the fuck is wrong with you?

5658
03:26:41,260 --> 03:26:42,020
Oh, they're gone.

5659
03:26:42,220 --> 03:26:42,880
They're gone.

5660
03:26:43,120 --> 03:26:47,160
That was a drive-by.

5661
03:26:48,380 --> 03:26:48,920
Alright, well...

5662
03:26:48,920 --> 03:26:50,120
I guess we can keep looting here.

5663
03:26:50,400 --> 03:26:51,880
I can't believe we don't have any movement.

5664
03:26:52,740 --> 03:26:54,680
There's actually so many movement items in this game.

5665
03:26:54,960 --> 03:26:55,780
Yeah, like what kind?

5666
03:26:56,400 --> 03:26:57,980
They have these gloves.

5667
03:26:58,500 --> 03:26:59,460
Oh, the magneto?

5668
03:27:00,120 --> 03:27:03,760
They have the magneto gloves, but then they have these gloves where you can launch yourself in the air.

5669
03:27:04,160 --> 03:27:04,600
Oh!

5670
03:27:06,400 --> 03:27:07,660
Oh, they came back.

5671
03:27:08,320 --> 03:27:09,200
They're leaving!

5672
03:27:09,780 --> 03:27:10,120
No!

5673
03:27:12,600 --> 03:27:13,660
Wait, what are they shooting at?

5674
03:27:13,660 --> 03:27:15,500
Wacky inflatable guys over here.

5675
03:27:17,640 --> 03:27:18,520
Alright, well...

5676
03:27:19,240 --> 03:27:20,440
Let's try to find...

5677
03:27:20,440 --> 03:27:21,280
I want to like...

5678
03:27:21,280 --> 03:27:22,300
Top off on heals.

5679
03:27:22,380 --> 03:27:23,000
I can't find any.

5680
03:27:23,240 --> 03:27:24,680
Yeah, I can't find any either.

5681
03:27:25,840 --> 03:27:26,640
Is there any down here?

5682
03:27:26,640 --> 03:27:27,640
I don't like bullets.

5683
03:27:28,500 --> 03:27:29,680
Wait, what gun is that?

5684
03:27:30,520 --> 03:27:31,260
Laser rifle.

5685
03:27:31,280 --> 03:27:32,580
This place is so dry.

5686
03:27:33,680 --> 03:27:35,160
I got distracted and do every match?

5687
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:37,760
Oh, that thing's hitscan.

5688
03:27:38,900 --> 03:27:40,980
Oh, that's what I like to hear.

5689
03:27:44,300 --> 03:27:45,340
Where do we go?

5690
03:27:46,380 --> 03:27:48,740
Let's go this way.

5691
03:27:49,240 --> 03:27:49,880
Oh, I can't ping.

5692
03:27:50,480 --> 03:27:53,040
Alright, well the game's ping system sucks, but I'm trying to ping over here.

5693
03:27:53,760 --> 03:27:54,620
I'm just going to follow.

5694
03:27:54,620 --> 03:27:55,580
I follow.

5695
03:27:56,260 --> 03:27:57,500
Follow the duck.

5696
03:27:58,260 --> 03:27:59,660
Don't worry.

5697
03:28:00,100 --> 03:28:01,860
John Cena never dies!

5698
03:28:02,540 --> 03:28:03,860
Do you have nitrous?

5699
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:04,320
Yeah.

5700
03:28:04,980 --> 03:28:07,980
Oh my god, we can run on water!

5701
03:28:08,180 --> 03:28:08,680
We're Jesus!

5702
03:28:10,280 --> 03:28:11,940
Oh my god!

5703
03:28:15,720 --> 03:28:17,720
Just like Jesus, my hero.

5704
03:28:22,400 --> 03:28:24,840
I fucking knew he was Jesus.

5705
03:28:26,840 --> 03:28:28,620
The almighty, powerful duck.

5706
03:28:28,920 --> 03:28:31,320
Oh wait, more nitrous?

5707
03:28:31,540 --> 03:28:32,900
There's nitrous in here if you need.

5708
03:28:33,300 --> 03:28:33,640
Nice.

5709
03:28:34,080 --> 03:28:34,940
What's this?

5710
03:28:35,940 --> 03:28:36,760
There's a repair?

5711
03:28:36,880 --> 03:28:37,700
Oh, that's for the car.

5712
03:28:38,440 --> 03:28:38,720
Yeah.

5713
03:28:39,760 --> 03:28:40,960
We can actually drive.

5714
03:28:41,080 --> 03:28:42,200
Oh, I got an idea.

5715
03:28:42,260 --> 03:28:43,480
We're going to try to get some movement.

5716
03:28:43,740 --> 03:28:45,740
Grab those nitrous.

5717
03:28:46,520 --> 03:28:46,980
Which one?

5718
03:28:47,280 --> 03:28:50,680
I don't know why it keeps doing the shotgun.

5719
03:28:51,240 --> 03:28:51,940
Yeah, I got it.

5720
03:28:52,500 --> 03:28:53,660
I'm trying to unping that.

5721
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:54,880
We're getting the car.

5722
03:28:56,200 --> 03:28:58,320
Let's go over here.

5723
03:29:00,040 --> 03:29:01,720
There might be some movement over here.

5724
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:05,420
There's also stuff we can heal on.

5725
03:29:05,740 --> 03:29:06,040
Like these.

5726
03:29:07,620 --> 03:29:08,280
Wait, does that heal you?

5727
03:29:08,280 --> 03:29:08,920
Oh, the cactus!

5728
03:29:09,860 --> 03:29:10,980
Wait, that's so cool!

5729
03:29:12,240 --> 03:29:14,740
The cactus, they regen in the desert area.

5730
03:29:14,740 --> 03:29:15,060
Yeah.

5731
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:19,800
And the desert area has a higher chance of spawning the gloves.

5732
03:29:20,840 --> 03:29:22,820
So I'm going to check over here.

5733
03:29:23,260 --> 03:29:24,500
To see if there's anything.

5734
03:29:25,520 --> 03:29:26,740
Yeah, you have 16 seconds.

5735
03:29:28,660 --> 03:29:31,860
We're also pretty close to zone 2, so we don't have to run for 5 ever.

5736
03:29:33,060 --> 03:29:34,440
Oh, and a nitro drill!

5737
03:29:35,140 --> 03:29:36,100
Let's get out of the car here.

5738
03:29:36,220 --> 03:29:37,480
Then we can just run around here.

5739
03:29:39,320 --> 03:29:41,240
My god, this place is sick.

5740
03:29:41,880 --> 03:29:42,240
Right?

5741
03:29:42,240 --> 03:29:44,520
These were one of the medallions spawned at 2.

5742
03:29:45,760 --> 03:29:47,240
This place is fucking sick.

5743
03:29:48,840 --> 03:29:49,280
Whoa!

5744
03:29:50,160 --> 03:29:51,460
What the fuck?

5745
03:29:52,540 --> 03:29:53,420
What's that?

5746
03:29:53,740 --> 03:29:54,860
Does that hurt you?

5747
03:29:55,940 --> 03:29:56,800
Uh, the flames?

5748
03:29:56,920 --> 03:29:59,160
Oh, the flames?

5749
03:29:59,320 --> 03:30:01,140
No, I'm talking about the fucking spinning.

5750
03:30:02,200 --> 03:30:03,940
Oh, the blades or whatever?

5751
03:30:03,980 --> 03:30:05,720
Oh my god, I got a house!

5752
03:30:06,160 --> 03:30:07,080
You got a house?

5753
03:30:07,200 --> 03:30:08,100
I got a house.

5754
03:30:08,100 --> 03:30:09,800
It's over for them.

5755
03:30:10,040 --> 03:30:11,440
It's fucking over.

5756
03:30:16,300 --> 03:30:17,800
We have real estate.

5757
03:30:19,860 --> 03:30:21,680
Alright, well, at least we ran through there.

5758
03:30:24,520 --> 03:30:26,560
This is what we're going to be playing on tomorrow.

5759
03:30:27,000 --> 03:30:27,940
Oh, this map?

5760
03:30:28,220 --> 03:30:29,520
So people are just going to...

5761
03:30:29,520 --> 03:30:31,200
Wait, did you claim a spot for tomorrow?

5762
03:30:32,460 --> 03:30:33,260
Uh, no.

5763
03:30:33,640 --> 03:30:35,160
Wait, can we actually claim those right now?

5764
03:30:35,160 --> 03:30:35,860
I don't remember.

5765
03:30:36,500 --> 03:30:37,780
We gotta look at the rules.

5766
03:30:38,140 --> 03:30:40,320
Yeah, I'll look at the rules and I'll see if I can claim something.

5767
03:30:42,260 --> 03:30:43,620
Am I basically a VTuber?

5768
03:30:43,840 --> 03:30:44,880
No, I'm a werewolf IRL.

5769
03:30:45,240 --> 03:30:45,900
He's a werewolf.

5770
03:30:46,020 --> 03:30:49,480
He used to be, when I met Doryu, he used to be a fleshy.

5771
03:30:49,740 --> 03:30:51,680
And he got bit by a wolf in between.

5772
03:30:51,860 --> 03:30:52,760
That's why, I don't know.

5773
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:55,220
I was like, yo, being a fleshy is cringe.

5774
03:30:55,320 --> 03:30:56,360
He got bit by a wolf.

5775
03:30:56,820 --> 03:30:57,960
So now he's a werewolf.

5776
03:30:59,380 --> 03:31:01,440
I know a wolf that also knows a wolf.

5777
03:31:02,340 --> 03:31:03,060
And then...

5778
03:31:03,060 --> 03:31:04,200
They also know another wolf.

5779
03:31:04,860 --> 03:31:05,760
Wait, are they all werewolves?

5780
03:31:05,780 --> 03:31:08,280
These things also are going to give us the nitro too.

5781
03:31:08,460 --> 03:31:09,080
Oh, shit.

5782
03:31:09,940 --> 03:31:11,040
Nice, we're super fast.

5783
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:13,380
Do you want those shockwaves?

5784
03:31:13,420 --> 03:31:14,480
Do you want to keep practicing with those?

5785
03:31:15,100 --> 03:31:15,920
No, I'm good.

5786
03:31:17,500 --> 03:31:19,080
I've already mastered it.

5787
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:22,580
I don't need anymore.

5788
03:31:23,940 --> 03:31:25,060
There's a tourney coming up?

5789
03:31:25,360 --> 03:31:26,940
Uh, so we're doing day 2 of the tourney.

5790
03:31:27,060 --> 03:31:28,280
Today was day 1.

5791
03:31:28,900 --> 03:31:30,280
And then tomorrow is day 2.

5792
03:31:30,280 --> 03:31:32,480
But we were doing on a reload.

5793
03:31:32,740 --> 03:31:34,300
Yeah, I thought...

5794
03:31:34,300 --> 03:31:37,180
I thought day 2 was when you qualify.

5795
03:31:38,420 --> 03:31:39,440
We did qualify.

5796
03:31:40,040 --> 03:31:41,160
Oh, it's true, true.

5797
03:31:41,220 --> 03:31:42,640
Guys, we qualify for day 2.

5798
03:31:42,740 --> 03:31:44,180
That's how good we are, guys.

5799
03:31:44,900 --> 03:31:47,840
Only 20 teams can qualify to day 2.

5800
03:31:48,220 --> 03:31:49,060
And we made it.

5801
03:31:49,740 --> 03:31:50,140
Wait, what?

5802
03:31:50,340 --> 03:31:52,500
You don't take fall damage with this either.

5803
03:31:52,860 --> 03:31:54,080
So you just jump from here.

5804
03:31:54,920 --> 03:31:56,300
And there's Baja Blast down here.

5805
03:31:56,440 --> 03:31:57,780
Oh, there's Baja Blast?

5806
03:31:57,840 --> 03:31:58,420
What does it do?

5807
03:31:58,420 --> 03:31:59,520
You walk into it.

5808
03:31:59,800 --> 03:32:00,620
And then look what you do.

5809
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:03,720
You literally become Tracer.

5810
03:32:04,220 --> 03:32:05,360
Wait, how did you do that?

5811
03:32:05,920 --> 03:32:07,140
It's a double jump.

5812
03:32:07,780 --> 03:32:08,240
Woah!

5813
03:32:09,480 --> 03:32:13,160
And every time you touch the Baja Blast, you get the dashes.

5814
03:32:14,160 --> 03:32:15,680
Wait, how long does it last?

5815
03:32:16,180 --> 03:32:16,960
It lasts forever.

5816
03:32:17,120 --> 03:32:18,880
It'll stay on you as long as you have the charges.

5817
03:32:19,660 --> 03:32:21,080
So you only get 3 charges.

5818
03:32:21,520 --> 03:32:21,800
Oh!

5819
03:32:22,880 --> 03:32:24,140
Okay, Baja Blast time.

5820
03:32:25,380 --> 03:32:27,040
Dude, Fortnite changed so much.

5821
03:32:27,040 --> 03:32:28,280
I know, right?

5822
03:32:30,060 --> 03:32:31,740
Wait, there's someone here?

5823
03:32:36,120 --> 03:32:36,760
Where?

5824
03:32:37,060 --> 03:32:38,940
I knocked a wolf man!

5825
03:32:39,060 --> 03:32:40,260
Where is he?

5826
03:32:40,320 --> 03:32:41,580
I killed him.

5827
03:32:42,780 --> 03:32:43,660
Where's his teammate?

5828
03:32:45,220 --> 03:32:47,080
You think you can get away?

5829
03:32:47,880 --> 03:32:49,640
I fucking have Baja Blast.

5830
03:32:53,740 --> 03:32:54,980
Yeah, tell him!

5831
03:32:56,140 --> 03:32:57,060
Fuck him up!

5832
03:32:57,060 --> 03:32:59,080
Oh my god, he has Nuka Cola?

5833
03:32:59,640 --> 03:33:01,660
What the fuck does the Nuka Cola do?

5834
03:33:03,320 --> 03:33:05,320
It heals 75 shields.

5835
03:33:05,880 --> 03:33:08,220
And then I think it heals like 50 HP.

5836
03:33:09,220 --> 03:33:10,360
What the fuck?

5837
03:33:10,720 --> 03:33:12,060
What is FalleN doing here?

5838
03:33:15,660 --> 03:33:16,720
They have FalleN?

5839
03:33:16,800 --> 03:33:18,580
When will they have Doki Bird?

5840
03:33:19,700 --> 03:33:20,620
They're throwing.

5841
03:33:20,760 --> 03:33:21,900
They gotta add Doki.

5842
03:33:24,140 --> 03:33:24,880
What's that?

5843
03:33:25,980 --> 03:33:28,040
We need to teleport you over here.

5844
03:33:31,140 --> 03:33:33,240
Where is... I hear gunshots.

5845
03:33:34,240 --> 03:33:35,620
Gunshots are on top of the hill.

5846
03:33:35,880 --> 03:33:37,980
They're over here.

5847
03:33:38,460 --> 03:33:38,860
Let's go.

5848
03:33:39,540 --> 03:33:40,600
Alright, let's fucking get it.

5849
03:33:40,680 --> 03:33:41,680
I don't like them.

5850
03:33:42,900 --> 03:33:43,980
I don't like them either.

5851
03:33:44,760 --> 03:33:46,400
Yeah, I don't like them.

5852
03:33:46,760 --> 03:33:48,180
I'm gonna kill them right now.

5853
03:33:50,520 --> 03:33:51,780
They're in my lobby.

5854
03:33:52,020 --> 03:33:52,920
I already hate them.

5855
03:33:55,240 --> 03:33:56,660
I'm gonna nitro here.

5856
03:33:57,080 --> 03:33:57,700
Where?

5857
03:33:58,240 --> 03:33:59,540
Can we run up here?

5858
03:34:00,060 --> 03:34:01,340
What the hell?

5859
03:34:01,400 --> 03:34:03,040
My character is teleporting.

5860
03:34:04,800 --> 03:34:06,500
I'm gonna nitro us again.

5861
03:34:07,300 --> 03:34:08,480
And then...

5862
03:34:08,480 --> 03:34:09,580
I'm gonna shockwave.

5863
03:34:12,590 --> 03:34:14,060
Did I shockwave you off?

5864
03:34:15,740 --> 03:34:18,160
Did I shockwave you away?

5865
03:34:18,260 --> 03:34:21,020
No, I'm gonna run the baby way.

5866
03:34:21,780 --> 03:34:22,380
Oh my.

5867
03:34:24,880 --> 03:34:25,540
I'm coming down.

5868
03:34:26,700 --> 03:34:29,340
They are handholding like crazy.

5869
03:34:32,460 --> 03:34:34,300
Moments before disaster.

5870
03:34:36,180 --> 03:34:38,700
These guys have all the movement.

5871
03:34:38,940 --> 03:34:40,100
And I'm just a little dude.

5872
03:34:42,780 --> 03:34:43,980
They're handholding.

5873
03:34:44,140 --> 03:34:46,940
I looked at them and I died so fast.

5874
03:34:48,680 --> 03:34:50,880
I am going to...

5875
03:34:51,880 --> 03:34:52,700
Yeah, I can grab your card.

5876
03:34:54,880 --> 03:34:55,620
This is teleport.

5877
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:56,880
I keep lag teleporting.

5878
03:34:59,960 --> 03:35:02,220
I died so fast.

5879
03:35:02,460 --> 03:35:05,040
Yeah, I literally was up here about to fight one of them.

5880
03:35:05,640 --> 03:35:07,580
And then they literally both handheld on me.

5881
03:35:07,620 --> 03:35:09,160
I was like, what is happening right now?

5882
03:35:11,760 --> 03:35:12,440
It's okay.

5883
03:35:12,780 --> 03:35:14,160
I have 200 seconds.

5884
03:35:15,540 --> 03:35:16,240
I got you.

5885
03:35:16,540 --> 03:35:17,500
You got me.

5886
03:35:17,640 --> 03:35:18,500
I have nitro too.

5887
03:35:18,620 --> 03:35:19,400
I have nitro.

5888
03:35:19,880 --> 03:35:22,840
I got your discord nitro.

5889
03:35:22,840 --> 03:35:24,020
We're going to live this.

5890
03:35:24,100 --> 03:35:27,560
Are they fighting?

5891
03:35:29,060 --> 03:35:30,180
It's so safe.

5892
03:35:31,180 --> 03:35:32,140
It's so safe.

5893
03:35:33,240 --> 03:35:36,200
This is the slowest rez ever, but we're so safe.

5894
03:35:38,570 --> 03:35:38,860
No.

5895
03:35:40,820 --> 03:35:41,960
I'm proud of y'all.

5896
03:35:42,280 --> 03:35:43,660
I'm proud of y'all.

5897
03:35:46,960 --> 03:35:48,120
Holy shit.

5898
03:35:48,200 --> 03:35:49,200
That movement though.

5899
03:35:50,120 --> 03:35:51,260
Wait, they're fighting now.

5900
03:35:51,360 --> 03:35:52,320
I might be able to get in.

5901
03:35:53,660 --> 03:35:55,920
No, they're camping the rez.

5902
03:35:57,020 --> 03:35:58,360
That's fucking right.

5903
03:36:01,860 --> 03:36:03,200
Is this guy buffed?

5904
03:36:06,040 --> 03:36:07,040
I see them.

5905
03:36:07,120 --> 03:36:07,820
Oh, they thirsted him.

5906
03:36:08,580 --> 03:36:10,160
Is that medallion good?

5907
03:36:11,200 --> 03:36:12,760
It gives me unlimited ammo.

5908
03:36:13,980 --> 03:36:14,540
But...

5909
03:36:15,120 --> 03:36:17,580
I don't think it's going to be what it will save me.

5910
03:36:17,580 --> 03:36:19,580
Oh, the gloves!

5911
03:36:19,740 --> 03:36:20,320
Is that good?

5912
03:36:20,780 --> 03:36:21,360
Yeah, it's good.

5913
03:36:21,840 --> 03:36:24,360
Holy shit, what is this movement?

5914
03:36:25,640 --> 03:36:27,040
What the fuck?

5915
03:36:27,760 --> 03:36:31,100
You literally traveled across the map in one second.

5916
03:36:31,560 --> 03:36:36,540
I told you, the movement in the other mode is so cursed.

5917
03:36:37,540 --> 03:36:38,080
Oh, no.

5918
03:36:38,340 --> 03:36:39,980
This is going to be tomorrow.

5919
03:36:41,460 --> 03:36:43,740
Oh, we are...

5920
03:36:43,740 --> 03:36:45,820
This is going to be tomorrow.

5921
03:36:45,820 --> 03:36:47,100
Oh, I get it.

5922
03:36:47,200 --> 03:36:48,140
I'm proud of you.

5923
03:36:48,620 --> 03:36:49,520
Oh, no.

5924
03:36:51,980 --> 03:36:54,800
Wait, is the hats going to exist tomorrow?

5925
03:36:55,440 --> 03:36:56,740
I think so.

5926
03:36:56,920 --> 03:36:57,880
Oh, no.

5927
03:37:00,400 --> 03:37:01,840
Oh, no.

5928
03:37:02,400 --> 03:37:03,020
No!

5929
03:37:04,580 --> 03:37:06,120
Oh, my God.

5930
03:37:06,480 --> 03:37:09,280
It took the whole game to find gloves.

5931
03:37:09,740 --> 03:37:11,160
Holy shit.

5932
03:37:11,640 --> 03:37:12,920
Oh, my God.

5933
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:14,460
Oh, my God.

5934
03:37:14,600 --> 03:37:18,160
We got to deal with that tomorrow?

5935
03:37:19,600 --> 03:37:20,560
Yup, yup.

5936
03:37:22,960 --> 03:37:26,920
Oh, wait, it said hands are not in rank, nor are cars.

5937
03:37:27,140 --> 03:37:27,800
Oh, thank God.

5938
03:37:27,880 --> 03:37:29,700
Oh, thank God.

5939
03:37:29,820 --> 03:37:30,000
Okay.

5940
03:37:34,860 --> 03:37:37,640
I really... I don't think I would like to play.

5941
03:37:38,100 --> 03:37:41,800
I don't think I'll have fun with the pros?

5942
03:37:42,260 --> 03:37:43,920
The pros with the hands?

5943
03:37:44,080 --> 03:37:45,000
I don't know.

5944
03:37:45,600 --> 03:37:47,180
You got hands.

5945
03:37:47,340 --> 03:37:48,220
That's what they don't have.

5946
03:37:48,300 --> 03:37:49,460
They don't have hands.

5947
03:37:49,620 --> 03:37:50,760
Oh, Jesus Christ.

5948
03:37:50,840 --> 03:37:51,760
Thank fucking God.

5949
03:37:51,900 --> 03:37:52,440
Gee, geez.

5950
03:37:52,520 --> 03:37:52,960
I had fun.

5951
03:37:53,120 --> 03:37:54,280
Gee, geez, Doki.

5952
03:37:54,820 --> 03:37:56,260
What a great day one.

5953
03:37:56,400 --> 03:38:00,920
Thanks for dropping by like an hour before the tournament.

5954
03:38:01,460 --> 03:38:02,960
I really appreciate it.

5955
03:38:03,340 --> 03:38:11,660
I was actually joking with my boyfriend about how I have this luck with Fortnite where I will always get pulled into something very last second.

5956
03:38:11,740 --> 03:38:13,100
And I'm like, you know what?

5957
03:38:13,740 --> 03:38:14,100
Fuck it.

5958
03:38:14,140 --> 03:38:14,580
We fall.

5959
03:38:14,680 --> 03:38:16,400
I'm just going to go all in.

5960
03:38:16,640 --> 03:38:17,080
Fuck it.

5961
03:38:18,940 --> 03:38:19,900
Thank God.

5962
03:38:21,100 --> 03:38:22,200
Gee, geez.

5963
03:38:22,460 --> 03:38:24,120
I'll see you on day two.

5964
03:38:24,980 --> 03:38:26,060
I'll see you day two.

5965
03:38:26,200 --> 03:38:27,360
I miss your face.

5966
03:38:28,500 --> 03:38:30,580
It's been a long time.

5967
03:38:32,200 --> 03:38:32,940
It's been a long time.

5968
03:38:32,940 --> 03:38:35,820
Let me know if you want to play a bit too before the tournament.

5969
03:38:35,820 --> 03:38:36,860
Yeah, I think I do.

5970
03:38:36,960 --> 03:38:38,820
I think I definitely need to warm up.

5971
03:38:41,640 --> 03:38:43,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5972
03:38:43,300 --> 03:38:44,720
Alright, I'll see you later.

5973
03:38:45,660 --> 03:38:46,820
Alright, bye Doki.

5974
03:38:47,260 --> 03:38:48,660
Bye Doryu.

5975
03:38:49,260 --> 03:38:50,700
Bye everyone in Doryu's chat.

5976
03:38:50,900 --> 03:38:52,320
Bye everyone in Doryu's chat.

5977
03:38:54,160 --> 03:38:55,340
Oh my God.

5978
03:38:55,800 --> 03:38:56,700
That was so fun.

5979
03:38:56,780 --> 03:38:57,840
I had a fun time.

5980
03:38:59,180 --> 03:39:02,500
Just playing with Doryu and just like being dragged around.

5981
03:39:04,380 --> 03:39:05,640
I didn't realize...

5982
03:39:05,640 --> 03:39:08,120
Wow, Fortnite changed so much.

5983
03:39:11,480 --> 03:39:12,940
Thank you everybody for watching.

5984
03:39:13,180 --> 03:39:18,200
I guess tomorrow, also, we're going to be playing Fortnite tomorrow for day two.

5985
03:39:19,320 --> 03:39:22,660
So, there's going to be more of the tournament with Doryu.

5986
03:39:23,200 --> 03:39:28,840
So if you guys want to check it out, it's going to be same time, 2pm PST on Twitch.

5987
03:39:29,820 --> 03:39:31,000
It always happens.

5988
03:39:31,000 --> 03:39:36,460
Every time I'm resting, there's a Twitch Rivals tournament that I get invited to, which I think...

5989
03:39:36,460 --> 03:39:37,760
It's happened a lot.

5990
03:39:37,960 --> 03:39:42,040
I realize it has happened frequently.

5991
03:39:42,860 --> 03:39:43,920
It's a pattern.

5992
03:39:46,300 --> 03:39:48,240
But it's been really fun.

5993
03:39:48,380 --> 03:39:49,760
I've been having a great time.

5994
03:39:50,420 --> 03:39:51,760
It's fun to...

5995
03:39:51,760 --> 03:39:54,380
I haven't talked to Doryu in a long, long time.

5996
03:39:54,660 --> 03:39:57,320
Like I said, I knew him back in Apex.

5997
03:39:58,820 --> 03:40:01,540
And he was still a fleshy.

5998
03:40:02,080 --> 03:40:03,340
Now he's a werewolf.

5999
03:40:04,060 --> 03:40:06,160
Now I have a werewolf bodyguard.

6000
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:16,220
But I'm glad that we had somebody to do this Twitch Rivals with.

6001
03:40:16,440 --> 03:40:27,020
Because like I said, we went through three different Fortnite pros and then I'm so happy that Doryu was able to sub in at super fucking last minute for us.

6002
03:40:29,100 --> 03:40:31,900
And with Twitch staff helping us too.

6003
03:40:32,540 --> 03:40:33,520
But yeah!

6004
03:40:34,000 --> 03:40:35,980
I really appreciate everybody for coming in.

6005
03:40:36,120 --> 03:40:37,720
If you guys don't know me, my name is DokiBird.

6006
03:40:38,280 --> 03:40:42,500
I usually stream on YouTubes, but today I am on Twitch for the tournament.

6007
03:40:42,680 --> 03:40:43,600
Usually for Twitch Rivals.

6008
03:40:44,040 --> 03:40:46,900
I am on Twitch for Twitch Rivals.

6009
03:40:47,060 --> 03:40:48,720
So please check me on YouTube.

6010
03:40:49,340 --> 03:40:52,760
If you guys want to know whenever I stream on Twitch, please follow me on Twitter.

6011
03:40:53,400 --> 03:40:55,060
We have a lot of promo stuff.

6012
03:40:55,140 --> 03:40:57,180
You guys know my Gamersub code.

6013
03:40:59,140 --> 03:41:01,240
You can support me via other means.

6014
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:03,900
I have so many other ways to support me with.

6015
03:41:04,140 --> 03:41:08,200
Like Gamersubs, the Hyatt merch, the merch store.

6016
03:41:09,100 --> 03:41:13,700
And thank you everybody for all the subs, the gifted subs, the bitties and the follows.

6017
03:41:13,940 --> 03:41:15,680
I really, really, really do appreciate it.

6018
03:41:15,960 --> 03:41:17,820
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

6019
03:41:18,020 --> 03:41:20,000
Pause, check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6020
03:41:20,300 --> 03:41:22,160
And if you except for me, head to bed.

6021
03:41:22,260 --> 03:41:23,380
Cause you deserve it.

6022
03:41:23,480 --> 03:41:24,580
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6023
03:41:25,060 --> 03:41:26,020
Bye guys!

6024
03:41:27,320 --> 03:41:27,760
Bye!
