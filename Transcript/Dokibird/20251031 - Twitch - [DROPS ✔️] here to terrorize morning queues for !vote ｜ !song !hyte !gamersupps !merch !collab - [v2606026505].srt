4
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,800
Like, I know I'm so sorry.

5
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,020
I know it's so, it's the last minute.

6
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,700
But I, like, yeah, I received the thing, like when I was asleep.

7
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,740
So I couldn't be awake to look over everything.

8
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,360
But yeah, I'm nervous.

9
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,180
I'm nervous about the Halloween thing, as always.

10
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,920
Like whenever I do something special, like, oh, you're hearing static.

11
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,320
Oh, that's just my bathroom.

12
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,000
It's because my bathroom thing is...

13
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,420
on.

14
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,600
It's not static.

15
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,560
It's, I don't know what it's called in English.

16
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,940
It's called Taofung in Cantonese.

17
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,800
I don't know what it's called in English.

18
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,260
It's like the, you know, when you're taking a shower, is it, is it called the extraction fan?

19
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,080
Is that what it's called?

20
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,440
But that was on.

21
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,480
That's what you were hearing.

22
00:05:34,800 --> 00:06:33,640
Yeah, I never knew what the English word for it is called because that my you know my parents would call it uh taofong in cantonese and so that's the only thing i know it as i never learned the the english word for it they'll just be like oh turn off the the exhaust fan in chinese and i'll just be like okay we're gonna turn it on uh but yes i am back for more rivals um for your consideration for the nom that just be because i realized i i wanted to stream this week just so I could like you know pad my stats up for the nomination and shit but I was so I was I've been like super tired um lately because I literally I told you guys like yesterday um that's why we had like such a short stream yesterday because I was so fucking exhausted because of what I had to do the day before yesterday um so like all the the tiredness is building up so I literally passed out at 10 p.m.

23
00:06:33,740 --> 00:07:07,500
and I woke up at 4 in the morning and I was like fuck I was just like fuck I was supposed to do my DJ now stream so I guess we're here I guess we're alive at this time what you're gonna do morning stream it's still um we're still terrorizing people but now we're gonna terrorize them in the morning as well because who because you're because like the people Are either people who like have been playing since three in the morning or?

24
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,400
Or they want to like they want us or they just don't have a job, I guess, or they're not going to.

25
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,640
Or they hate themselves and they're playing in the morning.

26
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,020
True.

27
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,020
Most of them.

28
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,400
So or they're European or they're European.

29
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,500
You're right.

30
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,240
Or they're children.

31
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,820
I mean, bullying kids.

32
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,920
What else is new?

33
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,300
Ring or they're sneaking in ring before work.

34
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,220
Why the fuck would you do that to yourself?

35
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,780
Why the fuck?

36
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,660

37
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,020
Thank you, thank you.

38
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:54,680
Or they worked the night shift and they just got off of work and now they have to deal with me terrorizing their lobbies.

39
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,220
That's fucking right.

40
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,180
All right, let me make sure the sound and everything is good to go.

41
00:08:01,500 --> 00:09:06,540
up anything yet so um i literally just put put myself on the screen and i was like that's good enough i'll do that lot i'll do the rest live all right i always save my sound settings uh okay now it's time to boot up the rivals the marble rivals yeah exactly that they can't get any worse when they started off with rivals but yes please for your consideration feel free to nominate me um for best marvel rival streamer i'm doing this for this i technically i do have a pack schedule this week but like apparently nominations ends next week and like my twitch channel looks really sad so i when the i don't want the judges to look at my twitch channel and be like wait they wanted us to nominate her like so um So I have to make sure my Twitch chat looks not as sad when they look at it.

42
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,280
Yeah, because I'm pretty sure the other nominations, they like stream this game every day.

43
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,260
So they'll be like, did we just got like bought it or some shit?

44
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,800
So I don't want to think that I bought it the nominations.

45
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,420
Like, I don't want them to think that.

46
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,460
Wait, she shoots two times a year.

47
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,640
Yeah.

48
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:41,140
You know, so, you know, for your consideration, I gotta make myself look like, uh, look like I'm alive on this, on this channel.

49
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,480
Uh, let me fix my display real quick.

50
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,520
All right.

51
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,640
All right, it's so weird.

52
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,720
My, my rivals keep spooting up on my second monitor.

53
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,140
I don't know why it does that.

54
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,580
I have not, I couldn't fix.

55
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,180
I can't.

56
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,900
I try to fix it, and I spent like an hour.

57
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:59,360
it and I was like that's enough that's how much it deserves like oh shit let me okay I gotta send an update on something um let's see I got sent a um all right sorry give me I need to do some notes real quick like I said like they're only a live for another hour so they're only they're only a for another hour and then like after that what we get is what we get for halloween so i gotta fix this um i stream more than there's no way i stream more than necros and uh bogey because like rivals is like their main shit i'm just the appetizer to the main meal Okay.

58
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,560
Alright, this part, okay.

59
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,840
Okay, I'm trying to make sure I don't accidentally say anything because then it'll reveal what this is.

60
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,470
Sorry, I gotta make sure I don't reveal what this is.

61
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,690
So I'm, like, saying it in my head and hoping I don't, like, say it out loud.

62
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,510
That's basically it.

63
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,670
Okay, there we go.

64
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,550
But yeah, I don't know why my, oh, by the way, remember the guy that said the gamer word?

65
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,310
There you go.

66
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,410
He got muted.

67
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,750
That's fast, actually.

68
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,110
The guy got muted for saying the gamer word.

69
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,030
Anyway, all right, let's go.

70
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,390
Let's go queue up, I guess.

71
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,170
Let's go terrorize the morning people.

72
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:54,830
They thought, I mean, to be fair, if they're playing this game this early in the morning, like, they know what they're getting.

73
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,770
They're not here to climb.

74
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,750
They're not here.

75
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,490
Climbing is not what they're aiming for right now.

76
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,490
It's just pain and suffering.

77
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,050
And I'm here to give it to them.

78
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,150
I am their EOMM agent clocking in.

79
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,770
Well, to be fair, I'm not grinding for anything.

80
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,870
I'm just here to make sure someone's not having a good time.

81
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,310
Not on purpose, of course.

82
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,290
Not on purpose.

83
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,070
It's just my mirror exists.

84
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,670
They'll be like, oh no, Jokey Burr's back online.

85
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,990
Is it lagging?

86
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,010
No, that's fine.

87
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,930
Oh yeah, I found a new...

88
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,430

89
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,090

90
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,830
Oh, there it is.

91
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,450

92
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,530

93
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,030
Okay, wait, why are we fighting?

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,540

No animals allowed!

173
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,790
Get out of here.

174
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,570
No animals allowed in the strip club.

175
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,330
Only one per club.

176
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:30,470

177
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,210

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,490
What the fuck out of here?

180
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:43,430
How can I be a successful business owner if everyone He's destroying my one only poll that I can have.

181
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,790
That the health inspector allows me.

182
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,790
Only I am an entrepreneur.

183
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,850

184
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,350

187
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,730

I took a seventh loan at the bank.

220
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,990
Pulls are apparently buried.

221
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,650

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,610

229
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,450
Oh, they didn't ban anything.

230
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,810

231
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,220
Alright.

232
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,600

I know, right?

234
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,420
Like, there's just no place for an honest businessman anymore.

235
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,560
It's just no place for me.

236
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,580
And then, town.

Thank you.

240
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,260
What the fuck?

241
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,520
They banned zero?

242
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,800
Like, how do you ban nothing?

243
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,420
A smoky.

244
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:58,720
Thank you.

245
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,600

Yeah, I'm like, what the fuck?

252
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,140
Also, why the fuck is this guy still playing at this time?

253
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,540
Not banning nothing.

254
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
They're that confident.

255
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,540
I fear the man who bans nothing.

256
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,680
He's like, I can play it.

257
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,800
They're like actual flex guides.

258
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,140
They're like, I fear nothing.

259
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,720
That's crazy.

260
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,400
Not banning Daredevil, too.

261
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
That's looking insane.

262
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,240
Yeah, I have known many over the years who would wish to control me.

263
00:21:52,160 --> 00:23:13,800

Come on.

268
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,080
There we go.

269
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:31,740
Look at that.

270
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,740
We did it.

271
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,180
What the fuck?

272
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,120
Oh, that's unlucky.

273
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,980
I did not realize that he also wanted to be.

274
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,220
Put his res here.

275
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,920
Look, both of us had the same idea.

276
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,820
Look, we both, unfortunately, had the same idea of what we wanted to do as Rocket.

277
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,540
He just was there first because it was his home.

278
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,600
Who requires healing?

279
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,520
Well, you're like all the way there, so I don't know.

280
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,260
Oh, shit, he's alive.

281
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,680
That's surprising.

282
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,840
I still died.

283
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,540
I just threw it off.

284
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,180
Guys, I don't think it's winnable.

285
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,180
I don't think it's winnable.

286
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,660
I have a feeling that my team, you know what?

287
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,520
No wonder they didn't ban anything.

288
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,960
No fucking wonder.

289
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,380
What am I supposed to do?

290
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,700
I'm just a fucking a fucking trash panda.

291
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,980
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

292
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm not even allowed in restaurants.

293
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,380
Here we go.

294
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,180
There we go.

295
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,680
Can we move up?

296
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,980
Oh, shit.

297
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,480
Why did she double support Altan?

298
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,820
What the fuck?

299
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,700
I mean, all right.

300
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,420
There you go.

301
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,560
I don't know why we double support Altan's that.

302
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,140
Like, oh, wow, that's on you.

303
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,500
You know, you double support Altan.

304
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,220
Thank you.

305
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,680
All right.

306
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,700
Now you have...

307
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,680
No one.

308
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,260
Hello guys.

309
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,980
I'll stay here.

310
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,200
Wait, I can stay here.

311
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,880
Wait.

312
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,560
Wait, this is, wait.

313
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,920
Wait a minute.

314
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,900
Oh shit!

315
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,460
Okay, I did not think he was gonna look at me.

316
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,020
Like out of everybody, I guess he decided to look up.

317
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,820
Who the fuck looks up?

318
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,480
That was so fucking smart of me.

319
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,920
Who the fuck looks up?

320
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,340
Like how good of a life you have that you actually are aware of your surroundings.

321
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,200
Yeah, just like fucking casual.

322
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,220
Only casuals look up.

323
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,320
Who the fuck does that fucking freak?

324
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,000
Looking up in this economy?

325
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:11,960
Exactly.

326
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,860
No, I don't think we're winning this.

327
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:48,680
I- I have- there's- I'm not confident in our- team anymore yeah there's nothing i could do there like all i could do is just go in my team and hope y'all kills everyone too and hope everyone dies for the y'all so i'm not alone i can't even put my reds the spider-man's gonna look for it the right queen's reign begins oh yeah i was gonna say Oh,

Oh, he fucking fucked up.

Yeah, he's bent.

00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,300
Oh, shit.

332

He's bent.

All right, guys, let's go.

00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,300

Oh, they're doing a shark native.

337
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,420
Thing is, I can't really put it here.

338
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,700
The spy man's gonna show up on that side.

339
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Yep.

340
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,820
Oh, I hope we do something about that shark.

341
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,840
Well, that's fine.

342
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,880
We're not.

343
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,620
We don't need to do anything.

344
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:48,920
I mean the fact that oh hello goodbye goodbye I'm a little worried about that there's a spider-man behind us guys against their cough all right so if I go up here the spider-man's gonna fucking come up to me but like I guess that's the risk I'll take oh sharks oh no shark Do we have up?

345
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,720
Oh, nice.

346
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,200
Oh.

347
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,600
Goodbye, Punisher.

348
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,160
Oh, unless.

349
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,400
Unless.

350
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,460
Oh, is he going to kill anybody?

351
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,260
Well, let's find out.

352
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
He has one kill.

353
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,300
Look at him go.

354
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Look at him go.

355
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,120
Oh, that poor Loki.

356
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,660
I can't believe it.

357
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,940
The Spider-Man didn't see me.

358
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,160
He doesn't look up anymore.

359
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,860
Look at that.

360
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,060
He thought he was becoming a gamer.

361
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,320
So you stopped looking up.

362
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,520
Oh, yeah.

363
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,940
I mean, yeah, Mag is good against anything.

364
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,960
Mag is like, literally, like, the best tank you can play.

365
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:30,940
Overall.

366
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,140
Like, where the fuck do I put this that's not gonna get destroyed?

367
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,740
Like, everywhere I go, the Spider-Man's just gonna show up.

368
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,000
You know what?

369
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,340
You know what?

370
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:41,960
Fuck this.

371
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,500
Oh, wait.

372
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,140
I thought I had ult.

373
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,320
Okay, there we go.

374
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,420
There we go.

375
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,580
There we go.

376
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,380
There we go.

377
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,520
We timed it perfectly

378
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,880
See look at that perfectly timed as expected No, no, no, no, no, no.

379
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:21,120
See look me like see because I I didn't have all I had it just in time for spider man It's not awkward guys because it worked out in the end It can't be awkward if it actually worked out.

380
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,160
You might...

381
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,240
Oh, they got my...

382
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,060
Why the fuck?

383
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,660
Okay, he got my...

384
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,480
Alright, guys, this is awkward.

385
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,540
Now it's awkward because we don't have res.

386
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,500
Oh, and there's that.

387
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,720
Yeah, mag is just good overall.

388
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,200
It's just...

389
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,540
That's just how it goes.

390
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,280
Oh my god, did our mag...

391
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,600
No, that was the enemy mag.

392
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,560
I mean, it'd be good if we have...

393
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,720
If we have portal.

394
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,600
Portal, guys.

395
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,120
Is anyone on a portal?

396
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,300
Wait, we alted?

397
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,120
We fucking Luna alted?

398
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,500
We are not portaling.

399
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,040
We are not portaling.

400
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,220
Okay.

401
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,840
That's cool.

402
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,400
I thought one of us would go to portal, but that's alright.

403
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,900
The current score is 2.

404
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,020
That's okay.

405
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,000
Alright.

406
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,440
See, we have one last.

407
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,920
Time to switch things up.

408
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,000
Including which side you're on.

409
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:55,060
all right nice okay we're good we're good to go yeah I was surprised I thought someone would pour it out that's okay we don't need it right we don't need it we're so confident about it oh dad's awake he's awake I let him he won the mental battle so now he's allowed on the bed again I'm a good guy who occasionally takes stuff that doesn't belong to him.

410
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:02,680
It's like, you know, if he doesn't get in my bed, he gets really angry.

411
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,720
And like I, oh my god, okay, give me a sec.

412
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,260
Mine's near entrance.

413
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,720
This round shall be no different.

414
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,880
I suppose you've made quite a name for yourself.

415
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:32,420
So the issue is that ever since I got the noise complaint, I'm a little more worried of whenever he starts barking.

416
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:41,740
Whenever, yeah, so like, I just get like a little nervous when he starts barking because I don't want to get kicked out.

417
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,760
If I'm going to kick out, it's on my terms, not on his.

418
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,220
Really?

419
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,160
Oh my god, there's nothing I can do.

420
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,220
There's no...

421
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,640
He has to play Animal Crossing if he wants to live.

422
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,060
Like, he has to play, like, Jeff or some shit.

423
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,060
Like, or he's not gonna be alive with this guy.

424
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,720
You'll be able to patty kick this way.

425
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,700
I don't even think a patty kick is gonna do anything.

426
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,300
I'm doing my best to, like, keep them up.

427
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:50,680
as in like right click I'm literally I'm just right-clicking I have I have not stopped right-clicking since we started like I I don't know man I've just been right-clicking bro they're gonna heal it yeah but we're we're out of we're out of fucking resources too okay you and me you and me oh no that's That's fine.

428
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,220
That's fine.

429
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,660
Look at that.

430
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,620
My one-old has saved this team.

431
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,380
Jeff's silent ulted.

432
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,540
Jeff's silent ulted.

433
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,420
Oh, that's fine.

434
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,100
Oh, that is not fine.

435
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,280
I mean, can we, it's, oh, bro.

436
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,960
Oh, goodbye, Envis.

437
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,100
Don't worry, I got you.

438
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,620
Oh, you had to walk into the Spider-Man.

439
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,960
I love you.

440
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,520
Oh, why can't you walk to me?

441
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,160
I had a res, bro.

442
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,380
I had a res.

443
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,520
Jeff is opening.

444
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,920
I feel like that's a bit too much.

445
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,280
Bro, there's nothing I could do.

446
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,740
That's okay.

447
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,780
We have res.

448
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,900
It's getting Jeff's coming over.

449
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,460
Another healer is coming over.

450
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,140
We're just taking shifts right now.

00:33:48,300 --> 00:34:20,460

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,260
You might have to kite it.

454
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,200
Oh.

455
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,380
Did we, were we kiting it?

456
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:28,940
Are we kiting?

457
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,160
Oh, we're not kiting it.

458
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,020
I think we win this.

459
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,700
I think we win this one.

460
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,720
Guys, we're down three.

461
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,480
I don't know.

462
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,240
Do we have a res?

463
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Do we have a portal?

464
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,480
Use a portal right now!

465
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,600
Oh, okay.

466
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,520
It's okay.

467
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,340
He's using it.

468
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,980
We're TPing?

469
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,320
Just fight.

470
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,240
Good.

471
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,440
Don't worry.

472
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,380
I'm gonna have to run it down.

Guys, guys, we have to, guys, we have to stay on point, guys.

503
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,240
Just literally, oh my god, there you go.

504
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,120
Fuck it, we're gonna fight this.

505
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,820
We have to fight this.

506
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,940
We have to all kill something.

507
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,300
We have to kill something here.

508
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,940
Alright, at least we stabilize, that's all that matters.

509
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,980
Okay, I'll take the stabilization.

510
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,760
Because we only have one fight.

511
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Now we made it so there's one fight left.

512
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,520
Oh, and now we have three tanks.

513
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,180
All right.

514
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,740
Strange, please.

515
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,720
Okay, that's good.

516
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,120
That's good.

517
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,620
That's good.

518
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,760
They don't know why I'm here.

519
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,620
I don't know who's there, too.

520
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,340
Bez?

521
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,620
They don't know why I'm here.

522
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,080
I don't know why I'm here, too.

523
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,640
I'm back.

524
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,160
This is like a magic shot.

525
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,940
I hope my heels are going over.

526
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,660
Like that's all that matters.

527
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,000
I think my heels are.

528
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,740
Yeah my heels are.

529
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,640
Okay my heels are.

530
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,960
Yeah yeah.

531
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,500
They don't know.

532
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,460
What they don't know won't.

533
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,920
Oh shit my only cover from Spider-Man.

534
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,220
Okay this could be like the biggest eat of all time for them.

535
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,480
Okay.

536
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,380
Okay.

537
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:37,860
Hello!

538
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,480
Please, we need to kill one guy.

539
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,280
Please!

540
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,840
Okay.

541
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,410
Oh my god, they have Spider-Man.

542
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:51,390
Oh, it's over.

543
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,290
It's over already.

544
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,270
Guys, it might be over.

545
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:58,490
We're not killing anything and we use all our alks.

546
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,230
We're not killing...

547
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,210

Come here, I will make you a star.

560
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,130
Relay deployed

561
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:55,140
No No It would let me open my My establishment I don't understand My perfectly legal establishment There's no laws against stripping How dare they sabotage my business How dare I know some very powerful people in the government

562
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,520
If anyone in Marvel could be a pimp, it'd be Rocket.

563
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,380
Yeah, there's no laws against stripping.

564
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,100
Only prostitution.

565
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,620
But only to get cut.

566
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,300
Capitalism is not a crime.

567
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:18,860
Exactly.

568
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,480
I'm surprised Loki doesn't have a dance emote.

569
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,120
That's what the curtains are for.

570
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,920
Can't get caught if there's a curtain there.

571
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,940
It's only illegal if you paid.

572
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,360
Let my people strip.

573
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,180
Wait, where is he?

574
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,740
Wait.

575
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,040
Oh my god, my usual...

576
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,240
Okay.

577
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,220
Big venom.

578
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,580
Do you have booty shake emo?

579
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,460
Things are gonna be different this time.

580
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,480
Loki should have a dance emote.

581
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,320
I don't understand.

582
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,140
Why everyone's so violent in the morning?

583
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,340
How dare you?

584
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,060
Oh wait, Star... Yeah, but I don't think... No, this Starlord's a bitch.

585
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,860
He's not an role player.

586
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,440
He ain't no RP here.

587
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,820
Now dance.

588
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,040
That's right.

589
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,280
Open for a bit.

590
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,720
No!

591
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,080
That's right.

592
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,820
He only did one shake and that's it.

593
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,240
I pay very well.

594
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,760
I'll let you know.

595
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,580
Why does no one want to go to the club?

596
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,440
I don't understand.

597
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,460
Does no one want to support your local businesses anymore?

598
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,420
What happened to supporting small businesses?

599
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:54,940
What happened?

600
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,420
I don't understand.

601
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,400
You know, um, the customers pay, and that's all that matters.

602
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,900
They get paid, and it's like working at fast food, where, like, majority of your pay comes from tips.

603
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,440
I like that.

604
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,960
How else do you think franchises stay that?

605
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,040
How else do you think they stay that big?

606
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,740
You get majority of your pay from tips.

607
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:58,280
look at that you get experience and dollar bills what's more than what else is there to ask for hey guys oh in the bedroom oh this is a private show now this is a private show guys i swear to god i've been here for five minutes i still have yet to have a have staff at my business Come on big venom.

608
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,640
Come on.

609
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,120
Come on.

610
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,560
Come on.

611
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,100
Come on.

612
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,160
It's right here.

613
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:07,920
Come on.

614
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,520
This is a very expensive pull.

615
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,000
Oh, that's right, girl.

616
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,600
Oh, she gone.

617
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,020
Not even in the honeymoon suite.

618
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,800
You think I made up money?

619
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,220
I can only afford one pull.

620
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:22,560
Guys.

621
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,360
That's all I have.

622
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,380
I only can afford one pull.

623
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,320
We gotta start small.

624
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,360
I got this.

625
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,000
I got the lease for like $300 a month.

626
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,170
I don't even own this pull.

627
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:42,990
I rent it.

628
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:44,250
Alright.

629
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:46,250
Come on.

630
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,090
It's just this easy.

631
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,210
Look, I'll give you an example.

632
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:48,710
Look at that.

633
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:49,190
Whoa.

634
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,810
It's like this.

635
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,110
And now you do it.

636
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,490
Look at that.

637
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,090
Whoa!

638
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:54,950
Look at that.

639
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:58,850
that easy.

640
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,330
Now you go, Jeff.

641
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,170
We don't discriminate.

642
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:07,490
Look at him.

643
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,870
I'm doing tricks on him, too.

644
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,040
Can't believe it.

645
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,180
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

646
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,300
Doki's business?

647
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,080
That's a crazy first message.

648
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,280
Doki's business is show business.

649
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,560
Now show me that booty shake.

650
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,320
Alright.

651
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,480

I believe in you.

655
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,540
Why are they so successful?

656
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,920
How did they get three mantises?

657
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,680
I could barely get one.

658
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,720
I don't understand why they don't want to work with me.

659
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,740
Oh, we have four support players.

660
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,820
Okay, that's not good.

661
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,020
I don't understand.

662
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,000
I don't understand.

663
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,140
Lady PS in this elo?

664
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,140
Also, why the fuck are you awake, Gomez?

665
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,620
Oh, wait, it's like...

666
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,960
Never mind, I forgot your East kiss.

667
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,800
Oh, shit, we're in the tier 3?

668
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,760
If this battle is to be won, it will be because you are on our side.

669
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,640
I didn't realize, Gomez, that's a Dragoon right there.

670
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:46,040
Because I took a nap, technically asleep, at 10 p.m.

671
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,500
Alright We really are gonna run.

672
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:55,840
Oh, Jesus Christ.

673
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:02,840
Oh, I mean we have in this so like Was it really like that scary?

674
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,440
Oh I do see a spot man, so goodbye

675
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,160
Okay, I hope we kill them.

676
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,680
Oh we don't that's why it's just streaming.

677
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:28,800
I mean we're here to make our dreams a reality Jesus Christ that's five minutes just gonna keep pulling

678
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:40,390
I'm just scared about this oh there you go goodbye there's so many pullers when we have one Invis

679
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:53,500
I mean everybody's just pulling like I don't know how to stop him oh he was so low too oh poor Phoenix I did everything thing I could.

680
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,060
Which is not that much, but like I'm just one little guy.

681
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,760
Oh my god.

682
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,700
Maybe we just don't have enough damage.

683
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,640
Just maybe.

684
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,620
We have so many heals.

685
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,080
Like I cannot build it all charge.

686
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,820
I just have to build all from just DPSing, which is bad because I don't play Mantas that much anymore.

687
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,280
Oh shit, Yes!

688
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,840
Or Jeff did it.

689
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,800
You know, I believe.

690
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,530
I have not fucking played Mantis in so long.

691
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,170
Like, I just play her like irregularly whenever I'm forced to play triple.

692
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,870
Because she's the best triple of Sephora character.

693
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,930
Don't worry, I wake you up.

694
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,430
No sleeping time on the job.

695
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,250
I'm not paying overtime.

696
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,690
I mean, I hope we have up where, um...

697
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,310
There we go.

698
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:02,750
Nice.

699
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:03,810
Goodbye.

700
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:10,150
Um, it's a little bad that, uh, because I don't have up yet.

701
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,530
Oh my god.

702
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:14,810
Oh my god, please.

703
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,330
I literally just hit one.

704
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:16,990
Okay, there we go.

705
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:18,010
There we go.

706
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,310
Okay, so we don't have up.

707
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,670
Or the only issue is that we might not have up.

708
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:53,910

709
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,740
I don't know who messed with him, but someone did.

710
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:01,520
Oh.

711
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,480
I'm a little worried, so...

712
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,540
There's a guy right here.

713
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,140
Oh, he's one.

714
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:11,780
There you go.

715
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,780
That's strange as up, so I'm a little worried, too.

716
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,340
Jesus, they all have up.

717
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,200
There's so many else right now.

718
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,420
We only have Jeff defensive up, too.

719
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:22,940
Okay, okay.

720
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,900
Bye.

721
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,060
Oh, I need a heal.

722
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:39,670
Good luck Okay, don't worry, I'm healing There is a guy right here.

723
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:43,550

724
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:47,810
Oh we do Oh, invis please I'm dying.

725
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:54,760
No, invis No, she held it.

726
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,040
Why?

727
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,660
Why did she hold it invis?

728
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:28,000
Oh my if she didn't hold it we win she held it the last second too that's so unlucky because i had my own right after we could have fucking rotated else there that's so unlucky the timing she even used it too that's the worst part the fact that she used it too so they don't we only have my i mean i could start it with my Fuck it.

729
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,740
I believe in us.

730
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,060
You know what?

731
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:30,540
Fuck it.

732
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,180
Let's go.

733
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,500
Okay, we don't need to start with my arm.

734
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,780
There you go.

735
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,120
I think we...

736
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,480
Oh my...

737
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,660
Don't worry, I got you.

738
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,320
Oh my god!

739
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,180
Never mind, I don't got you.

740
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,620
I...

741
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,600
Never mind.

742
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,100
Oh my god.

743
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,080
I didn't think we were gonna push that up.

744
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,760
That's so unlucky.

745
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,420
I should have ulted early, too.

746
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,340
I was like, Whoa, everyone!

747
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,580
Whoa, whoa!

748
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,120
Whoa, guys!

749
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:10,440
Whoa!

750
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,080
This sucks because, like...

751
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,800
This is bad just because, like, the strange has all...

752
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,820
Because I've interrupted it, so it's, like, at 50%.

753
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,460
oh no

754
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:44,960
nice I don't know who I'm healing that is also an issue I don't really know who I'm healing right now there's so many people in front of me

755
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:58,510
so fuck get this guy get this fucking raccoon wait wait he's so low I mean he's 1h He's 5 HP, but he's so low.

756
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,150
There you go.

757
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,730
I love here.

758
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:05,850
Oh!

759
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,990
TP, TP, TP, TP, TP.

760
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:10,150
Did I?

761
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,070
I don't think I did.

762
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,070
You stunned the stranger, I was hoping.

763
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,010
Where is he though?

764
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:18,910
I don't think I can.

765
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,270
Oh my god, I'm scared.

766
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,630
All right, the double.

767
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,330
Oh my god, he dodged it.

768
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:34,830
Okay.

769
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:38,970
Oh, I don't know how he died to that.

770
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:43,290
I don't know how he died to it.

771
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,370
Oh, she got ulted.

772
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,490
She got strange ulted.

773
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:48,750
That's so unlucky.

774
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,410
That's so unlucky for her.

775
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,170
I didn't even realize she got ulted.

776
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,050
That was, I could have, I could have healed her.

777
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,830
I thought she was fine just because she got her alt off.

778
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,850
I didn't realize she fucking ulted so early.

779
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:14,550
I mean that's smart, she predicted it, but yeah, because of that I didn't realize.

780
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:24,840
Normally you know, everybody's like reactionary, so the fact that she was able to get that alt off.

781
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,240
Oh, guess I'll go down now, we don't have a tank anymore.

782
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,480
He's so low.

783
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,420
That's unlucky.

784
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,480
We only used a leopard for the last fight.

785
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,220
Where is that?

786
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:39,960
Where is that?

787
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,140
Oh my god.

788
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,980
He is not having a good time.

789
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,640
He is absolutely.

790
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:49,980
Bro, I'm trying.

791
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,600
I'm trying, Jeff.

792
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,220
I don't have heals.

793
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,580
How many there are Jeff yet?

794
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,060
He got the mantis.

795
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,180
Don't give them another inch.

796
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,440
Our rocket is not having a good time.

797
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,220
No, our rocket is...

798
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,620
Oh my god, I gave you everything!

799
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,800
We are undefeatable!

800
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,820
I don't have leaves anymore, I'm sorry.

801
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,960
I'm taking every damage possible.

802
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,040
Yeah, that's unlucky.

803
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:55,700
Oh man, that first point That fucking first point Time to switch things up Including which side you're on Life energy is a powerful weapon Yo Who's he yo-ing for?

804
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,080
Yo

805
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:17,100
Yo yo I don't think I was the problem I'll just say that.

806
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,000
It ain't me.

807
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,360
I'm never the issue.

808
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,420
If I stream, I'm not the problem.

809
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,000
That's how it goes.

810
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,220
30 seconds before you attack.

811
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,060
Yeah.

812
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,300
It's called a streamer buff.

813
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,960
Oh yeah, these feel free to nominate me for my rival streamer.

814
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,160
I really appreciate it.

815
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:59,680
It's why I'm doing these fucked up hours stream because these are the only times I can stream rivals outside of my regular schedule.

816
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,920
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

817
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,340
All right, I just got to follow the widow around.

818
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,740
I don't know if our widow's good, but I'll follow her around.

819
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,440
There's our way to go.

820
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,380
That is all I can do.

821
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:24,900
There you go.

822
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:25,920
She's asleep now.

823
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,800
Like, can we wake her up?

824
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,580
What the fuck?

825
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,180
I look away for one second.

826
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,880
I'm gonna say, what the fuck happened?

827
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,540
Oh my god, she actually dodged it.

828
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,020
Can we get that...

829
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:52,420
Strange?

830
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,060
That's like, literally... Oh, never mind.

831
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:54,880
Yes, he lives.

832
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:58,780
Unless...

833
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,400
There's our widow.

834
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:01,520
There you go.

835
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,180
Just push up with that.

836
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:04,560
Yay!

837
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,980
Oh my god, there's a Starlord right here.

838
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,100
Oh, shit!

839
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:10,780
Okay, it's fine.

840
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,600
He's got the healers.

841
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:18,070
Alright, here's a little damage boost for you.

842
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,130
I don't know if I should, like, let her trust in my Adam res.

843
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:28,010
Or just use it.

844
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:29,390
I don't know.

845
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,830
He's like, do I trust...

846
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,010
He's like, do I trust my atom?

847
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:36,710
Oh, I can't.

848
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:38,030

Was that one star lord all?

880
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,800
It could happen.

881
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,000
You know, it was possible.

882
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,980
Maybe, I know I could have trusted my team, but it was possible.

883
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,620
I have to go to my widow.

Oh, that's unlucky.

891
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,020
Um, our team's dead.

892
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,920

01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,380
There you go.

Just run at him.

901
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,300
There you go.

902
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,360

903
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,500

01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,240
Oh, never mind.

905
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,160
He went to steal.

926
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:13,410

01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,370
I don't know if he gets that.

928
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:15,750
Okay.

01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:21,010
Go.

938
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:21,710
Go.

939
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:21,910
Go.

940
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:22,670
Go.

941
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:23,130
Go.

942
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:23,470
Go.

943
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:25,410
Go.

944
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:26,330
Oh.

945
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,790
We have to live this.

946
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:33,610
Please keep on getting.

947
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,930
Please, kill him!

948
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:43,830
Oh, no.

949
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:46,950
Okay, that's fine.

950
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:48,990
I don't have leaves.

951
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,710
It might not be fine anymore.

952
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:52,990
Stay on point.

953
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:53,850
Stay on point.

954
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,260
It's okay.

955
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,280
Jesus Christ.

956
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,380
It's literally just the tanks.

957
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:05,760
There we go.

958
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,860
Okay, this is a little worrisome now.

959
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:18,240
This is a little bit worrisome now.

960
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:19,560
Oh, nice!

961
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:20,460
Nice!

962
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,920
Now I just need to do zero assists after that.

963
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,780
Life energy is a powerful weapon against evil.

964
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,080
The right heroes could make all the difference.

965
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,720
after that.

966
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,020
Buy a threat.

967
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,980
I mean, to be fair, I'm literally just babysitting our widow.

968
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,400
I'm not, like, doing anything else.

969
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,280
I'm just, like, I'm, like, take my leaves.

970
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,320
I'm just, like, take it, you whore.

971
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:51,680
Take these leaves.

972
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,590
No, I'm not doing so.

973
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:06,290
You can, like, the Simba 9-0 guy, the other Mantis he's vibing.

974
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:34,230
You can tell that he does play DPS all I do is pocket I'm supposed to do more kills as mantis but like I don't know I'm just not used to playing here it's been so long I mean if it was like season 0 or 1 then maybe but it's just I don't have a lot of time on her since I started playing the other supports

975
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,110
I don't want to waste nice.

976
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:48,590
I'm trying to make sure.

977
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,470
I'm trying to make sure she always has two.

978
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:59,350
But the thing is, I'm also not really...

979
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,130
Nice.

980
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:06,010
I'm not doing... I'm not building ults right now, which is bad.

981
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:11,410
Oh, this is...

982
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:12,610
I think we guys, we...

983
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:15,130
You might have to, you know, stop the cart.

984
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:21,050
Guys, we should stop the cart, guys.

985
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:23,730
Oh, or not.

986
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:27,370
You know, it's just like, you know, suggestion.

987
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:33,970
It's just a nice suggestion to have.

988
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:38,330
There you go.

989
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:41,470

990
01:13:43,070 --> 01:14:17,370

991
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:19,730
Oh, this is bad.

992
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:21,390
Oh, this is so bad.

993
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:22,870
I thought we were going to rush in.

994
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:30,670
They have Starlob portal now, so good luck everyone.

995
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:32,190
Legendary.

996
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:34,430
Oh, there we go.

997
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:39,190
Yay!

998
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:41,970
Who let Strange die first?

999
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,870
Or last.

1000
01:14:44,390 --> 01:15:06,450

1001
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:19,900
jesus christ stat wise we should win but it's not about stats apparently

1002
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:37,110
guys i don't know stat wise logically we should win but i don't know anymore anything can happen in marvel rivals

1003
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:52,100
i'm just i'm the assist mantis all i do is just all i do is just damage booster i met our widow i follow her around like a fucking die.

1004
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:57,080
They're like, I want damage boost and I'll be like, bow, wow.

1005
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:11,860
Four, three, two, one.

1006
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,700
Maybe she can get like a chickpea.

1007
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,700
Oh, that's not what I wanted to damage boost.

1008
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,960
No more leaves.

1009
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,800
We just need that, you know.

1010
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:27,420
One hit.

1011
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,240
Oh my god.

1012
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:35,880
I want a heal and I want a damage boost.

1013
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,740
It's like, I'm so conflicted.

1014
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:44,040
I'm just trying to give them as much damage boost as possible.

1015
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,120
Well, which is two.

1016
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,400
I'm trying, guys.

1017
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,420
I'm trying to save it all for our widow.

1018
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,320
Where did she go?

1019
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,420
Careful getting pushed off the map.

1020
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,680

Jesus Christ.

1028
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,390
That's his name.

1029
01:17:59,190 --> 01:17:59,770
He's easy.

1030
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:00,490
Is he streaming?

1031
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:01,770
Yeah, he is.

1032
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:05,350
.

1033
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:05,650
.

1034
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:09,830
Well, not the widow.

1035
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:11,850
I know forky fucking streams.

1036
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:15,170
But I don't know.

1037
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:16,650
Like, usually...

1038
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:19,970
No snitching.

1039
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:25,150
Someone's really like, no snitches.

1040
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,210
We'll never know, I guess.

1041
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:38,910
We'll never know who he is.

1042
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,350
That guy is crazy.

1043
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:44,350
He has to be somebody.

1044
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:47,770
An average key.

1045
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:48,270
All right.

1046
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:49,490
What the fuck?

1047
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,650
Okay, I was going to say, why is there Luna?

1048
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:57,690
I guess we'll never know.

1049
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,840
I was going to be like, what the fuck?

1050
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,240
Why is he playing Luna?

1051
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:09,280
If I can play DPS, I'm touching Luna anymore.

1052
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,780
Yeah, no, it's obviously an all-out account.

1053
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,040
Of course.

1054
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:36,360
all I'm saying is like if I if I can aim like that like goodbye support I'm done with you like no it's someone it's just someone smurfing like not smurfing but just someone um on a on a secret oath account we'll

1055
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:44,350

they avoided all wait I got avoided Like, they're like, no worry, I avoided our whole, what did I do?

1057

1058
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:11,590

01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:15,490
I followed you around and everything.

1061
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:17,610
What is fuck me for?

1062
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:24,690
After all the leaves I gave you, he said, fuck you too.

1063
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:27,630
I gave him so many leaves.

1064
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:32,530
I don't understand the betrayal.

1065
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,570
The actual betrayal.

1066
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:43,480
I pocketed him out.

1067
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,500
He's banned from my strip club.

1068
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:46,640
That's it.

1069
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,360
I'm blacklisting this man from my strip club.

1070
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:54,060
He ain't getting any from the mantises I have in my club.

1071
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,880
Yeah, he took all my leaves and for what?

I found my...

1077
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,620
I found them.

1078
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,900
Which hero do you think I fucking found them?

1079
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,060
Oh my gosh.

1080
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,800
Do I have to play Mantis again?

1081
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,540
Do I...

1082
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,600
Oh yeah, no.

1083
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,760
I've been wanting to play Dispatch.

1084
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,740
It's just my schedule is super...

1085
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:18,400
schedule is just super uh packed for this week and like i didn't have time to do like a long playthrough but i wanted i did want it to do like two parts for um two parts for batman i can't play adam because we don't have luna might as well just go to

1086
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:44,160
pick your hero all right i'm not judging this is five energy is a powerful weapon against evil The Dispatch Episode 1 is out now, and it's like five hours.

1087
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:55,090
So, but I didn't have a time to do, like, an actual long, long stream today.

1088
01:23:55,470 --> 01:24:03,970
Or not today for this week, so I was just like, oh, I'll just, I'll just, yeah, for next.

1089
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:07,330
Actually, I can't even do next week, because next week it's, like, freaking Street Fighter.

1090
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:17,050
Also, I'm going to, I, it's not announced yet, but I'm, I mean, you'll see in my schedule for next week, But I also have an Apex Legends hide-and-seek tournament on Saturday as well.

1091
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,390
So it's like mega fucking packed.

1092
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:21,070
Because it's like Tree Fighter tournament.

1093
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:23,050
And I haven't even practiced that yet.

1094
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:26,210
I'm planning on doing that like either today or tomorrow.

1095
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:28,970
But there's Tree Fighter.

1096
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:32,830
And then there's apparently I'm one of the seekers for the hide-and-seek tournament.

1097
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:34,570
That's hosted by Nokia.

1098
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:37,350
So there's that.

1099
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:38,410
And yeah.

1100
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:40,270
So it's like all over the place.

1101
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:42,970
So I don't have a lot of space to do anything else.

1102
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:50,670
No, no, and there's a sponsor thing I have to do next week as well You'll find out what no don't worry next week.

1104
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:11,830

Guys, can we kill this one giant tree?

1111
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:34,710
Like, is that a little bit too much to ask for?

1112
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:40,470
Alright, they're running triple as well.

1113
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:44,170
I didn't realize we capped it.

1114
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:45,310
I was just like waiting.

1115
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:46,810
I was like, why is it not capping?

1116
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:51,430
Oh my god, that's so many headshots.

1117
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:53,030
Wait, I'm giving you two leaves after that.

1118
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:54,190
That was a lot.

1119
01:25:55,290 --> 01:26:00,030
All I heard was ding ding ding But you get two leaves now.

1120
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:04,070
I swear to god if you avoid me after I give you two leaves, I swear to god

1121
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:12,170

01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:17,750
Here here's two leaves you whore That's right, I know what you want.

1123
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:22,610
Okay, he's gonna ult, so I'm not gonna do anything.

1124
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:25,970
Jesus.

1125
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:28,650
I'm backing up for that.

1126
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:32,050
I am ready to put on a show.

1127
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:34,030
He poured the ult.

1128
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:35,810
He's so confused.

1129
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:38,810
Look at how fucked the ult, girl.

1130
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,870
Oh wait, that's the raccoon.

1131
01:26:47,210 --> 01:27:19,060

1132
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:27,180
I got a gamer move right here.

1133
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,400
Watch this.

1134
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,540
It's called pressing Q!

1135
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:34,680
Don't worry, I'll wake you up.

1136
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:38,240
That's right!

1137
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,520
Look at that!

1138
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:45,670
Look at that, guys.

1139
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:47,930
Isn't that crazy?

1140
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:48,610
He has all.

1141
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:49,590
He has all.

1142
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,270
I'm fucking giving me a sec.

1143
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:51,790
I'm leaving.

1144
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:56,770
Oh my god, I...

1145
01:27:57,610 --> 01:27:58,170
What?

1146
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:01,630
Okay, that was, that should have hit.

1147
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:04,510
It literally gave the hit sound marker too.

1148
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:06,410
Which that sucks.

1149
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:08,370
Oh, nice.

1150
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:08,770
He none.

1151
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:12,370
Oh god, she pressed the button.

1152
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:14,490
No, Loki fucking sucks.

1153
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:19,750
Unless you're, I guess like he's okay in triple support, but he's fucking terrible in general.

1154
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:23,390
Nobody has ever pressed Q like that before.

1155
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:25,810
I feel empathy for an enemy and still destroy.

1156
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:27,290
Yeah, I know all the pros are like in it.

1157
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:29,770
Yeah, all the pros aren't playing, so the games are a lot easier.

1158
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:31,950
It's more of a comp point flip, though.

1159
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:34,330
I'd say all the casuals are just playing.

1160
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:40,270
No, he's, like, hard nerfed.

1161
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:41,690
He's not really, like, meta.

1162
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:47,570
And he's only okay in triple support, and even then, there's better characters to play in triple support, like, Adam.

1163
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:48,550
Right over.

1164
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:49,650
Adam over Loki.

1165
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,590
He's still pulling my heart.

1166
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:57,290
Yeah, they, like, got a bad nose, like, you're next.

1167
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:36,690
he's okay in triple support but even then like um like you have to have like really good coordination that's why he's terrible in ring you have to have really good coordination for it to work in a in a pro environment which is basically what pro play is but even then like only a couple of teams can utilize it well that's why you don't see a lot of teams use and then triple support because only a few care only a few pro teams can use him okay what you fucking shimmy to the left that's it oh

1168
01:29:43,810 --> 01:29:45,790
that's so fucked up

1169
01:29:50,040 --> 01:30:02,920
he literally gave him a five man our and the Angela gave him a fucking five man that's one again like you know That's not fair!

1170
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,060
Like, are you- are you actually got the assist?

1171
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,280
That's so fucked up.

1172
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:11,800
There we go.

1173
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,760
Oh, there I go, apparently too.

1174
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,940
I swear, please, please!

1175
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,540
Get him out of here!

1176
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:24,660
Alright.

1177
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:27,720
That's fine.

1178
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,140
Oh no, please, I don't want to get in the noise clip.

1179
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:30,920
Please, please!

1180
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,180
This is not fair!

1181
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:32,640
Please!

1182

Are you serious?

01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:06,870
I...

1187
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:14,470
I was trying so hard to avoid him.

1188
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:15,910
That's crazy.

1189
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:24,050
I was doing everything I can to avoid him.

1190
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:25,050
Holy fuck.

1191
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:27,750
Okay.

1192
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:28,670
That's fine.

1193
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:31,670
I need a farm for these.

1194
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,590
There you go.

1195
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,870
Oh my god, thank god the mags save- Oh!

1196
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:42,510
Thank god the mags save me.

1197
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:48,490
Okay, we still- we're still rotating our support ults.

1198
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:54,730
Gotta make sure our Hella gets all the damage boost he needs.

1199
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:57,790
Goodbye.

1200
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:00,530
Goodbye.

1201
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:04,970
He's doing it.

1202
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:05,950
He's putting on a show.

1203
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:10,590
Go do your fucking headshot shit while I back up.

1204
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:16,770
They do have mantis, which I am afraid of.

1205
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:20,970
Alright.

1206
01:33:23,070 --> 01:33:24,250
I'm so confused.

1207
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:25,470
Like, what are they looking at?

1208
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:30,030
I'm trying my best to help out.

1209
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:31,330
I'm like, what are you guys looking at?

1210
01:33:34,090 --> 01:34:02,930

01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:06,950
Oh, it's to rotate this, which is pretty bad.

1212
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:12,070
Are you serious?

1213
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:13,850
He was so low, too.

1214
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:18,150
Okay.

1215
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:22,320
Nice.

1216
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:24,640
No!

1217
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,460
I am trying my best.

1218
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:38,420
I am... Oh my god, it's too late for us.

1219
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,020
It's okay, we have a rocket.

1220
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:41,180
We have...

1221
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,380
Oh my god.

1222
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:49,800
Like, yeah, we lived that.

1223
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,340
Winning, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1224
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:55,540
I was, like, fucking trying to make sure our hello was alive.

1225
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:57,760
He was, she was, like, carry out of all of that.

1226
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:01,120
I was like, I see her deleting everyone.

1227
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:05,800
I was like, this guy will get all the leaves possible.

1228
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,940
He's the only one getting leaves.

1229
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:13,800
Single final Mattis goes fucking crazy.

1230
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:21,000
Look, my goal, I see Loki, I farm Loki heads, and then I give it to our Hella.

1231
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:21,760
Yeah.

1232
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,500
That's it.

1233
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:25,920
I'm not here to kill.

1234
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,420
That's my Hella's job.

1235
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,820
I'm here to farm damage.

1236
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,520
Farm damage to get.

1237
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,140
Look, this man just had two.

1238
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:40,800
Double me, but, but like, it's all of, it's Hella's.

1239
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,140
Today is Hella's Day, not my day.

1240
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:43,720
All right, I'm gonna.

1241
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:47,060
I want to give dad food because I don't want to get a noise complaint.

1242
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,780
I'll be right back.

1243
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:48,980
Wait, don't worry, guys.

1244
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:50,400
Don't worry, though.

1245
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,980
I'll make sure you get a dinner and show.

1246
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:55,760
I'll be right back.

1247
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:47,860
Clip to Club Doki.

1248
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,000
Everyone.

1249
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:53,580
Alright, do a match.

1250
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,060
I gotta expand my business.

1251
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,620
One day.

1252
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:04,300
One day my business will be just like those other.

1253
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,020
Rockets.

1254
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:06,820
One day.

1255
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,900
What the fuck?

1256
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:10,600
Hate crime.

1257
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,720
What's going on?

1258
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:14,060
What's going on in my premises?

1259
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,520
No hate crime allowed.

1260
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:19,340
Everyone's equal in my strip club.

1261
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:20,600
As long.

1262
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,940
As long as you know what you want.

1263
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:27,900
Ladies.

1264
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:30,860
Whoa!

1265
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:32,940
Okay.

1266
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:34,800
Okay.

1267
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,220
She's not a... She's blacklist.

1268
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:38,840
Who is harassing me?

1269
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,780
Except for that fucking widow player.

1270
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,380
Fuck that guy.

1271
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:45,380
I did so much for him.

1272
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,140
And he's like, I avoided the whole team.

1273
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:49,320
Fuck you.

1274
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:54,540
All I did was shove leaves in your mouth.

1275
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,480
What more do you want from me?

1276
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:00,100
Alright.

1277
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,260
The club is open.

1278
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,280
Club Doki Bird is back in.

1279
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:07,820
back in action.

1280
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,280
Hello, do we have any dancers?

1281
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:17,300
I'm scouting out some talents right now.

1282
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,460
Any dance.

1283
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,220
Look, here, this is what you have to do.

1284
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,960
Here, I'll give you guys an example.

1285
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,560
You go up here and you're like, Whoa!

1286
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:29,040
That's all you have to do.

1287
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:35,540
And that's like, yeah, we have an all you can eat wings buffet, too.

1288
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:38,440
That's when you know it's a good club.

1289
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:39,660
It's a...

1290
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:42,280
That's when you know.

1291
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,520
Here, I'll give lessons, guys.

1292
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:45,340
Look, look.

1293
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,360
Look at this.

1294
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,020
That's what you gotta do, ladies.

1295
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,500
Is that easy?

1296
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,620
Is that easy?

1297
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,240
Any takers?

1298
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:58,500
Come on, come on.

1299
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:01,160
A business needs only one dancer.

1300
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,360
The startup club.

1301
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,880
They do not want it.

1302
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,280
What kind of RP server?

01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:31,720

She saved my life.

1305
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:41,460
Here is the lore.

1306
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,540
Okay, this is apparently...

1307
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:43,920
This is the RP session now.

1308
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,880
Alright, we're gonna hear somebody's life story.

1309
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,820
It was me against a gang called Diablos.

1310
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,640
Citywide gang.

1311
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,900
I won.

1312
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:57,880
So how the fuck did she...

1313
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:01,540
How did she save your life if you already won?

1314
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,240
story time at my strip club

1315
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:32,360

1316
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:46,360
If I give you two cookies, would you advertise my channel?

1317
01:40:55,390 --> 01:41:03,210
I'm gonna poach his viewers.

1318
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:06,250
Yeah.

1319
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:10,910
Leave her.

1320
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,630
There we go.

1321
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:18,630
This is not the roleplay I wanted.

1322
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:20,470
Bye-bye now.

1323
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:22,450
Follow, please.

1324
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:27,310
You can't just ask him to leave it.

1325
01:41:29,310 --> 01:41:29,590
What?

1326
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:30,250
He had...

1327
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:33,390
Bro, he had such low expectations, man.

1328
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:35,410
One cookie and...

1329
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:39,190
That's all it takes for him to, like, ride or die for her?

1330
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:44,090
You gotta...

1331
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:48,730
You know, he's gotta, you know, look bigger.

1332
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:51,550
For most guys, yeah.

1333
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:53,030
You know?

1334
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:54,650
What's that word?

1335
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:56,930
He's gotta, like, have higher standards.

1336
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:01,550
It was a really good cookie.

1337
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,320
I'm sad.

1338
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:09,900
My strip club is failing.

1339
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:11,180
I don't know what I can do

1340
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:25,360
Hey guys I don't know what to do guys I took a loan and everything like no one wants to dance I don't understand.

1341
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:27,720
Why does no one want to dance?

1342
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:41,970
Oh my god, wait Wait, why do we have a fucking wait, I'm fucking Celestia 3.

1343
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:42,570
Why?

1344
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:46,030
One guy is one above all.

1345
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:49,510
Okay, can I chill now?

1346
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:50,890
I don't want to aim anymore.

1347
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:54,910
Now, who am I going to banish from this match?

1348
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:56,750
Can I chill now?

1349
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:07,110
Alright, I believe in my team I'm doing bans because I don't know how to... I don't play enough this season to know what the...

1350
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:08,730

1424
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:13,300
Wait, what?

1425
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:14,580

01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:18,140
Who the fuck TP'd?

1427
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,060
What happened to her TP?

1432
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:27,960
What the fuck?

1433
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,160
No one says anything.

1434
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,620
We don't know.

1435
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:36,980
Who the fuck used TP?

1436
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:39,840

01:49:39,860 --> 01:49:43,620
Jesus, where the- Where did we have a fucking string?

1438
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:51,300
Someone- Oh, I think someone used TP and then swapped off.

01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:56,520
Like, they- they were not expecting.

1440
01:49:58,440 --> 01:49:59,100

1441
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,320

1445
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:15,980
There we go.

1446
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:20,180

Avoid Luna jet pump zero belly.

01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:45,140
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

1470
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,040
You'll need a top notch team to...

1471
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:49,380
I felt like I was in a horror film.

1472
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,000
Like, what the fuck was happening?

1473
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:54,480

It's so like people don't target bad.

1507
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:04,020
If you're a streamer, you just pull up your stream anyway.

1508
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:09,420
So you didn't... Jesus, are you somehow... Jesus fucking Christ.

Alright, I'll do one more.

1519
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:41,760
If they're still introducing the teams.

1520
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:43,820
Doesn't hurt.

1521
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:47,680

01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:30,400
I don't understand.

1528
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:33,900
There was no cons.

1529
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,040
I find I'm doing it myself.

1530
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:39,000
Like, I don't understand.

1531
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,160
It's foolproof.

1532
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:44,820
Like, why doesn't anyone want to invest in my strip club?

1533
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:48,240
I don't understand.

1534
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,900

There you go.

We got Spider-Man.

1546
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:09,900
My first...

1547
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,440
My first worker.

1548
01:59:12,580 --> 01:59:13,280
My first worker.

1549
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:14,160
My first staff.

1550
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:17,060
We got a Spider-Man.

1551
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:19,120
But where is he?

1552
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:20,380
Spider-Man!

1553
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:21,320
Spider-Man!

1554
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,880
That's right.

1555
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:28,980
Yeah!

1556
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:32,000
Yeah!

1557
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:33,860
Let's go!

1558
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:36,900
I can't believe it.

1559
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:37,720
We're doing it.

1560
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:40,300
We're becoming successful business owners.

1561
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:43,140
Support your small businesses.

1562
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,400
He knows this assignment.

1563
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:49,460
Support your small local businesses right now.

1564
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:52,040
Oh, look at that.

1565
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:53,040
Oh, me.

1566
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,340
Girls.

1567
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,980
And we have Spider-Man!

1568
01:59:58,500 --> 01:59:59,080
Yep.

1569
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:02,080
It's printing, but he's a probe.

1570
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:04,040
He's a professional.

1571
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:07,100
Baby, I'm making you a star tonight.

1572
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:08,160
Spider-Man.

1573
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:11,000
All those amateur photos you're taking?

1574
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:13,220
That's...

1575
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:14,840
That's peasant stuff.

1576
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:16,840
I'm taking you to Hollywood.

1577
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:21,700
You don't have to take those photos anymore for your only fans, girl.

1578
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:24,820
One of those...

1579
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:25,860
on your iPhone.

1580
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,920
You don't have to take those photos on your iPhone.

1581
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:30,420
I got something better for you.

1582
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,540
He's done this before.

1583
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:37,060
I don't trust me, Spider-Man.

1584
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:43,080
Of course, regarding the split, there'll be a 80-20.

1585
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:46,300
Obviously, I get the 80 because I scouted you.

1586
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:47,700
I discovered you.

1587
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:50,220
If it weren't for me, you would have been nothing.

1588
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:55,720
You'd still be in that bedroom of yours, to JJ.

1589
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:57,060
That's right.

1590
02:00:57,340 --> 02:01:00,020
Now those voters are gonna go everywhere, girl.

1591
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:02,260
Now...

1592
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:05,300
You can even keep the tips.

1593
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:12,040
No, the toxic gaslight.

1594
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:18,260
Oh, do we get the same team from last game?

1595
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:19,820
What you think you wanna be today?

1596
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:22,120
I don't even know.

1597
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:25,160
Uh...

1598
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:26,600
Sure.

1599
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:27,100
Sure.

1600
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:31,660
Let's just play Bakun.

1601
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:36,200
Now, who am I going to banish from this match?

1602
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:45,200
I think it's, yeah, I think this might be LG, depending on, uh, this might be LG.

1603
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,280
Doki tempting Spider-Man, like the green goblin in the first movie.

1604
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:56,820
If I could bring a couch out for Peter, I would.

1605
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,500
I'm Forky's widow.

1606
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:04,000
I know you thought I avoided you, but you were the only...

1607
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:04,320
Yay!

1608
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:05,500
Wait, I was!

1609
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:08,340
Val, you're not banned from the strip club.

1610
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:09,620
I'll let you back in.

1611
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:12,320
I'll let you even pick the ladies you want.

1612
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:16,940
Yay!

1613
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:22,600
Not avoided.

1614
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:23,800
Let's go.

1615
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:25,980
Let's go, guys.

1616
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:27,580
I didn't get avoided.

1617
02:02:27,780 --> 02:02:28,060
See?

1618
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:31,480
I knew I didn't fuck up.

1619
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:34,640
Pick your hero.

1620
02:02:40,050 --> 02:02:40,570
Yippee.

1621
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,840
All right, you're off the blacklist, buddy.

1622
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:54,690
See, pocketing the curious...

1623
02:02:54,690 --> 02:02:58,610
I mean, if you have a widow, you could just fucking follow them around like a dog.

1624
02:02:59,390 --> 02:03:01,810
Like, that's really your only job as Mantis.

1625
02:03:02,590 --> 02:03:04,310
I told you it's never me.

1626
02:03:04,990 --> 02:03:05,970
I told you.

1627
02:03:10,890 --> 02:03:12,730
Can't beat me, I'm streaming.

1628
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:20,570
Streamers never fuck up.

1629
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:26,350
We don't talk about the Stewie 2K situation right now, but streamers never fuck up.

1630
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:32,030
Well, that's crazy, though.

1631
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:33,570
I guess that's crazy.

1632
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:37,670
This guy has won a million plus dollars in just prizes.

1633
02:03:37,690 --> 02:04:04,230

Yeah, their devil literally was terrorizing me for five minutes straight.

Guys, I don't think we winning this.

1639
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:27,960
Like, you know what we need?

1640
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:32,460
One singular Bucky can change everything, but I guess not.

1641
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:34,800
Oh, yeah, goodbye.

1642
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:37,180
I get it.

1643
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:43,140
You gotta believe.

1644
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:47,700
I don't think we win this, guys.

1645
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:51,600
Guys, this ain't looking so good.

1646
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:55,440
I think we're like, the booty munchers gonna win.

1647
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:00,880
Yeah, but it's actually...

1648
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:03,420
It's actually crazy that...

1649
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:06,240
I mean, gambling addiction is like no joke in general.

1650
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:11,340
Like, it is really sad that...

1651
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:13,420
That that's the thing.

1652
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:15,340
But it's crazy, though.

1653
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:17,260
Like a million dollars.

1654
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,400
Yes, gamble that away.

1655
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:21,060
More than a million.

1656
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:26,640
Goodbye.

1657
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:30,040
There we go.

1658
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:34,280
Believe in my teammates.

1659
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:34,980
I believe.

1660
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:38,560
The fact that the cloak and I lived that long.

1661
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:40,000
After what we went through.

1662
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:42,780
We went through so much.

1663
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:56,390
he was like and like he sold skins that belong to other people too which is crazy i think that's fucked up whoa you know my only platform where else can i go on high ground

oh there's a daredevil whoa there i go no whoa oh my god oh my god get me out of here get me out

1665
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:16,600
It's time I wanted to be eaten.

1666
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:19,280
That's so unlucky.

1667
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:22,000
I was one second too late to get to eat.

1668
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:25,380
Oh my god.

1669
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:27,400
I was literally one second away.

1670
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:32,040
That's unlucky.

1671
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:35,740
Alright, I do have a...

1672
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:37,280
He might just destroy it.

1673
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:38,180
But like, you know.

1674
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:40,740
It's a nice cosmetic.

1675
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:44,260
It looks cool.

1676
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:45,900
for five seconds.

1677
02:08:46,860 --> 02:08:48,420
And that's all that matters.

1678
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:50,320
You know?

1679
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,100
There we go.

1680
02:08:58,800 --> 02:08:59,740
Oh, my god.

1681
02:08:59,900 --> 02:09:00,140
Goodbye.

1682
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:02,080
Goodbye.

1683
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,460
Yeah, I ain't getting eaten tonight.

1684
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:07,420

Thank you.

1701
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:33,180
That was crazy.

1702
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:34,400
I'm surprised we won that.

1703
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:35,380
That was...

1704
02:10:36,340 --> 02:10:39,120
They're going, like, fucking hard-ass time.

1705
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:41,820
I'm surprised we lived long enough for that.

1706
02:10:47,190 --> 02:10:48,150
The game started?

1707
02:10:48,350 --> 02:10:49,590
Yeah, that's why I'm saying this is LG.

1708
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:53,570
I won't be like, hey, can you guys, like, Game started, guys.

1709
02:10:53,650 --> 02:10:54,610
Do you guys want to watch it?

1710
02:10:55,570 --> 02:10:57,250
If we win, we can end it early.

1711
02:10:57,570 --> 02:11:00,510
So we can all watch Friday the 8th night matches.

1712
02:11:00,910 --> 02:11:03,350
Playoffs at Atlanta DreamHack, guys.

1713
02:11:03,730 --> 02:11:04,450
Isn't that cool?

1714
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:07,070
You're missing out, everyone.

1715
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:08,690
Come on.

1716
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:10,710
Do you guys want to end the game now?

1717
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:12,450
If you just let us win?

1718
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:18,770
No, I'm not going to watch it, though.

1719
02:11:19,050 --> 02:11:19,490
I don't care.

1720
02:11:21,730 --> 02:11:23,270
That much for a watch-along.

1721
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:26,790
Also, I have to prep my Halloween stream, too.

1722
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:29,550
Mostly, like, I don't care.

1723
02:11:29,710 --> 02:11:31,610
I'm just not a watch-along person, you know?

1724
02:11:31,870 --> 02:11:33,290
It's just really that.

1725
02:11:33,590 --> 02:11:36,110
Like, it's all preferences, and I'm not...

1726
02:11:36,590 --> 02:11:38,930
I don't do watch-alongs in general.

1727
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:40,090
Unless I get paid.

1728
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:41,830
If I get paid, I'll do a watch-along.

1729
02:11:42,070 --> 02:11:44,410
But, unfortunately, that ain't happening.

1730
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:48,230
Oh, shit.

1731
02:11:48,550 --> 02:11:48,750
Okay.

1732
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:51,550
I did not expect that...

1733
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:55,990
I mean, I use...

1734
02:11:55,990 --> 02:11:56,850
I mean, we live?

1735
02:11:57,790 --> 02:11:58,990
It's not all I meant.

1736
02:12:00,990 --> 02:12:01,410
Hello.

1737
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:04,070
Like, he's alive.

1738
02:12:05,510 --> 02:12:06,670
I'm just gonna do this.

1739
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:08,250
I think, like, they're fine.

1740
02:12:08,410 --> 02:12:09,150
They don't need me.

1741
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:15,380
That's crazy.

1742
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:17,440
They, like, dove our...

1743
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,080
Our Hawkeye for 20 years.

1744
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:22,240
And nothing happened.

1745
02:12:28,270 --> 02:12:31,010
Okay, so there is a Angela here.

1746
02:12:33,610 --> 02:12:34,910
This is why we go Animal Crossing.

1747
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:39,930
I don't know why they're not going Animal Crossing because, like, it would help a lot.

1748
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:41,090
Oh my god!

1749
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:44,190

02:12:44,530 --> 02:12:44,770

I help you and you help me.

1752
02:12:49,890 --> 02:12:50,890
That's all we need.

1753
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:53,350
Oh, we should!

1754
02:12:55,170 --> 02:12:57,330

02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:39,820
Yeah, it is different because I'm an active participant.

1759
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:43,300
It is different.

1760
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:47,920
I'm an active participant in this lobby.

1761
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:53,800
That was that long.

1762
02:13:53,900 --> 02:13:55,560
