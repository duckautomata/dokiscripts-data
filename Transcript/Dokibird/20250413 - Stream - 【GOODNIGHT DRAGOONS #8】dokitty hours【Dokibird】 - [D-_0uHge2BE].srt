00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,260
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,660
Today is a chill day, yippee.

3
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,560
Hello, hello.

4
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,880
It's been a while.

5
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,980
It's been a while since we have a Good Night, Dragons.

6
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,520
It is 10pm for me, so I am definitely at lower energy.

7
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,320
I also got ice cream.

8
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,420
I ordered myself some ice cream.

9
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
I am a child.

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,040
You guys must be like, why are you a child?

11
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,080
Well, the two flavors I picked was blue cotton candy and bubble gum.

12
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,600
I don't know why.

13
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,220
I just love... I don't know.

14
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,020
I just love the cotton candy flavor.

15
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,680
I always just grab the cotton candy.

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,880
If I can, I would always order cotton candy because, I don't know, it's just a flavor that I really enjoy in general.

17
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,620
So yeah, I guess I am just a child.

18
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,340
So I'm like wondering, am I smaller?

19
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,560
I don't know.

20
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,680
I don't know if I'm smaller.

21
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm trying to figure out, do I look smaller?

22
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,640
Should I be a little bigger?

23
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,720
I can't tell.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,560
I can't tell anymore.

25
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,980
I feel like I did mess with the sizes.

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,120
Let me double check, guys.

27
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,420
Let me double check if this is the same.

28
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,740
No, I am smaller.

29
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,420
Am I?

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,440
I can't tell.

31
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,640
Hmm.

32
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,900
I can't tell if I'm smaller or not.

33
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,100
Give me a sec.

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Let me double check.

35
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,300
No, this should be the right size.

36
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,000
No, I am.

37
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,100
I can't tell.

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,060
I'm a purple.

39
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,900
I'm a tiny bit smaller.

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,180
No, that can't be it.

41
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,060
Let me double check real quick.

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,600
I just need to look.

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,860
Okay, there you go.

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,740
I am the same size.

45
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,500
I think I am.

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,520
I think I am the same size.

47
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,740
Let me see.

48
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,020
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,160
I'm like really out of it too, by the way.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,740
I think I'm the same size as I normally am.

51
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,900
As I normally am.

52
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,580
I don't know.

53
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,960
It's like my go-to ice cream flavor.

54
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,860
I always try to get cotton candy flavor.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,880
Because, I don't know.

56
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,780
It's just my favorite ice cream flavor is either cotton candy or green tea.

57
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,360
But it's so hard to find good places that make green tea here in Canada.

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:28,780
Because like, you know, green tea ice cream just doesn't hit, just doesn't taste right in like NA.

59
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,440
Like Asia green tea ice cream, oh my god, it's so good.

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,600
But like when I try to eat green tea ice cream in Canada, it just doesn't taste right.

61
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,440
It feels like there's a lack of flavor.

62
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,980
I think that's the right word.

63
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,020
There's just no flavor to it when I try to eat green tea ice cream here.

64
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:54,320
Even when I'm like going to like Asian places, like Asian ice cream stores or Asian restaurants to try to order green tea ice cream.

65
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,880
It's just, I think it's just like the ingredients here is harder to get versus in Asia.

66
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,380
So like I, now like in NA, I just get cotton candy ice cream because at least like it tastes like something.

67
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,700
If I try to get like green tea ice cream here in Canada, like I barely taste anything.

68
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,040
It's like barely a taste of like a barely any flavor or my taste buds are dying.

69
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,480
I don't know.

70
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,600
It could be one or the other.

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
It could be both.

72
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,600
My taste buds might just be dying.

73
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,620
I don't know.

74
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,520
The older I get, the less I taste.

75
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,020
And then I need like more sweetness in there to actually like...

76
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,200
I need more sweetness to actually taste anything these days.

77
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,760
Like I don't know anymore.

78
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,540
I honestly, I don't know.

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,940
It could be one or the other.

80
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,860
Um...

81
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,240
Let's see.

82
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,800
Oh my god.

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,520
Do I... Actually, sorry.

84
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm like super anal about this.

85
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,140
I'm like, do I look smaller?

86
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,620
Trying to figure out if I look smaller or not.

87
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,420
I can't tell.

88
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,380
I can't tell if I'm smaller or not.

89
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,780
No, no, I was leaning back.

90
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,300
Oh, okay.

91
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,140
No, I figured it out.

92
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,300
It's because I was leaning back.

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Okay.

94
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,600
No, I'm a perfectly right size for a cat.

95
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,180
I'm a perfectly okay size cat, guys.

96
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,080
No, it does.

97
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,020
I'm like super like anal about these things.

98
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,680
I'm a perfectionist.

99
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,000
So I hate it when I'm like different.

100
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,700
Like if I'm on the screen and if I'm like, oh...

101
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,520
If something's positioned like weird, like positioning is off just a little bit.

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,020
Like everything is off for me.

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,080
So I'm like, oh my gosh, why am I a little smaller?

104
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,740
I don't like this.

105
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,480
And then like, I'm very like particular about these things.

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,880
It's also similar to like...

107
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,320
If my monitor moves in any way, I hate it.

108
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,560
It like throws me off for like a week or so until I get used to it.

109
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,920
Yabby, thank you for the super chat.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,880
Thank you, thank you.

111
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,400
Hi Doki.

112
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,140
What was your choice of drink during massage?

113
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,920
Thank you for the super chat.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,640
Thank you, thank you.

115
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,940
It was the orange soju flavor.

116
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,080
I had that for... I had an entire bottle of the citron soju.

117
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,660
Citron?

118
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,000
Citron soju flavor.

119
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,980
Because I think that one tastes the best out of all the soju flavors.

120
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
I mean, it's that or lemon.

121
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,560
I think that lemon and peach are the best flavors from soju.

122
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,680
But yeah, I got that for my alcohol, my alky-ha.

123
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,520
Thank you for the super chat.

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,320
Thank you, thank you.

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,080
Today is a chill day because it's goodnight dragons.

126
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,400
So we're just going to be yapping.

127
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,040
We're going to hang out together.

128
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,800
And just chill a little bit.

129
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,180
I am a little eepy right now because of the blood moon.

130
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,600
It's really bad.

131
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,380
So I am already a little eepy.

132
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,240
I don't know what to talk about.

133
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,440
But I hope you guys have a great day today.

134
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,400
We had a great day hanging out with me today.

135
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,180
And doing whatever you guys have been doing.

136
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,700
For me, I think literally my entire day was wake up.

137
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,880
Exist as a person in bed for like an hour.

138
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,900
And then stream.

139
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,600
No, wait.

140
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,220
No, okay.

141
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,180
No, that's not right.

142
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,100
Because then my stream was at 5.

143
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,760
Alright, exist as a person for two hours.

144
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,680
And then stream.

145
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,240
There we go.

146
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,000
That sounds better.

147
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,420
And then I ordered ice cream after...

148
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,940
After a good hunt where I killed all those kangaroos.

149
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
And... Sorry, I'm like ripping.

150
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,860
I have... Okay.

151
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,260
I have this habit of like...

152
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,100
When I... If there's a label on a bottle...

153
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,840
I only do this for bottles.

154
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,480
Like if there's a label on a bottle, I like to rip the label off.

155
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
And it's like my way of fidgeting.

156
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,040
Alright, see you.

157
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,880
Thank you for the super chat.

158
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,780
Thank you, thank you.

159
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,620
Hi Doki, hope your evening is good.

160
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,280
I definitely want to post art of you eventually.

161
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,300
Thank you for the super chat.

162
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,300
Thank you, thank you.

163
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,520
I hope you... I hope you do.

164
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,640
I look forward to seeing it.

165
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,840
Just use my art tag.

166
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,780
Doki Gallery.

167
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,040
I had to think a little bit.

168
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,780
I was like... I almost...

169
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,960
Okay, not gonna lie.

170
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,060
I almost said my old art tag.

171
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,860
Because it like rolls off the tongue easily.

172
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,540
I had to think for a sec.

173
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,740
I was like... Doki Gallery.

174
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,420
So that's why I had to pause.

175
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,280
So you hear me ripping paper right now.

176
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,500
Is...

177
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm literally just ripping the label off of the soju bottle.

178
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,780
Because I just have a habit...

179
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,780
I have a habit of...

180
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,780
Ripping labels off of things.

181
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,340
Not things, but just bottles in general.

182
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,040
Just any drink related stuff.

183
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,280
I just like ripping it off.

184
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,740
It's just very comforting.

185
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,460
Coyote!

186
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,480
Thank you for the super chat.

187
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Thank you, thank you.

188
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,760
No, because I'm a kitty.

189
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,520
I'm Doki.

190
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm not Doki Bird.

191
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:10,920
I'm Doki.

192
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,660
No, it does not coexist with the feather.

193
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,060
Because this is when...

194
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,180
The feather is when I'm in bird form.

195
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,080
And the ears is when I'm on kitty form.

196
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,520
So this is like the difference between one and the other.

197
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,320
But thank you for the super chat.

198
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,380
Thank you, thank you.

199
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,580
Um...

200
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,740
What was I gonna say?

201
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,820
What was I gonna say?

202
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,560
Fuck, okay.

203
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

204
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,320
Thank you, thank you.

205
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
I just got back from the hospital.

206
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm good, but I just wanna say thanks for being a bundle of joy.

207
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,000
You're an inspiration to me and many others.

208
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,320
Thank you for the super chat.

209
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,180
Thank you, thank you.

210
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,180
Exactly, birds and cats cannot coexist.

211
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,980
But yes, thank you for the super chat.

212
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,900
Thank you, thank you.

213
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm glad you're feeling a lot better.

214
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,080
I hope whatever it was, you're at the hospital for it.

215
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,180
Things are okay over there.

216
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,360
But thank you for the super chat.

217
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,960
Thank you, thank you.

218
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,600
Oh yeah, I wanna say about next week's schedule.

219
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,140
Next week, I wanna play Super Mario Man.

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,100
So that's the only thing...

221
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:15,500
The only thing confirmed for next week is Super Mario Man and Visage chapter...

222
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,640
The second chapter with Min.

223
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,020
It'll be same time, same day for the Visage stream.

224
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,440
So yeah, that's the only two things that I've confirmed for this week.

225
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,700
Just those two.

226
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,280
What are things that I wanna talk about?

227
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,660
I feel so, so, so, so, so chill right now.

228
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,140
I'm like, low energy, don't kidding.

229
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,080
I'm a lazy cat right now.

230
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:41,960
Meow.

231
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,020
Oh yeah.

232
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,260
Doki Amber Doge did it yesterday.

233
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,380
So like, he likes to...

234
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,960
When he likes to roll around and roll on his back when he's playing with his toy.

235
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,260
And then he got so excited, like, so into his toy that he like, rolled off the bed.

236
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,480
I was like, freaking out.

237
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,580
I was like, like, are you okay?

238
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,560
And then he just like, he just looked at me and then just walked...

239
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,760
Like, I have many stairs.

240
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,640
I have many stairs for him to walk to my bed.

241
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,440
Walk up to my bed, cause I don't wanna encourage him to jump a lot.

242
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,280
But like, he doesn't give a fuck.

243
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,280
He still jumps off the bed.

244
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,700
And he just like, he looks at me and just walks back up in the bed.

245
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,740
Stupid dog.

246
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,540
Oh, oh, oh yeah.

247
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:32,900
Oh yeah.

248
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,100
Did you guys see that?

249
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,420
You can use...

250
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,180
There's...

251
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,360
Okay, I'm not talking about like, AI.

252
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,840
I know there's like, AI.

253
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,160
Where you can play Minecraft AI or something.

254
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,100
That was a long time ago.

255
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,380
But someone made actual AI.

256
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,200
You can make AI Minecraft houses in Minecraft now.

257
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,260
Did you guys see that?

258
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,140
That's fucking crazy.

259
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,040
There's like, a new plugin that generates Minecraft houses.

260
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,580
Yeah, in Minecraft.

261
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,520
Yeah.

262
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,860
You can like, it would like, AI generate an actual Minecraft house.

263
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,860
This is fucking crazy.

264
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,940
I wonder if I like, saved the tweet.

265
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,360
I saw a video of it.

266
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,800
I was like, what the fuck?

267
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,020
Like, you don't even make your own house anymore.

268
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,380
You can fucking generate...

269
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,400
You can AI generate a house now.

270
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,360
I...

271
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,600
That's insane.

272
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,460
That's fucking insane.

273
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,600
Like, we're at this point, like, point now.

274
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,180
In life where like, people don't even make their own houses anymore.

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,680
Let me see if I can find it guys.

276
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,380
I'm gonna scroll.

277
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,720
I know like, I wrote it down.

278
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,860
So I don't know if I actually like...

279
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,960
I don't know if I actually...

280
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,440
Saved the tweet.

281
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,660
The video of it.

282
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,380
Cause that blew my mind when I saw that.

283
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,620
And I was like, Jesus fucking Christ.

284
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,500
How lazy are we getting right now?

285
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,960
We're AI generating.

286
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,700
We're literally AI generating Minecraft houses.

287
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,700
Just build a fucking dirt house.

288
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,160
Okay, Minecraft AI.

289
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,060
AI house.

290
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,500
Let me see if I can find it.

291
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,440
Trying to...

292
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,460
Alright, let's see.

293
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,320
I don't even know.

294
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,260
Minecraft house.

295
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,440
I don't even know if I can find...

296
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,180
Oh, there it is.

297
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:29,860
Alright.

298
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,340
Here.

299
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,680
They use like...

300
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,380
It's based off of diffusion.

301
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,420
It was crazy.

302
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,320
I was like, what the fuck?

303
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,200
It's so...

304
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,840
It's so like, fucky too.

305
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,520
It's so...

306
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,220
I don't know what's the right word to say.

307
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,480
It's like...

308
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,540
I know there's like a better...

309
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,840
Like a better tweet of it.

310
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,420
But it's just...

311
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,120
It's so like, weird to see.

312
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,400
Just...

313
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,760
You know.

314
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,160
You put up TNT down and it just makes a fucking house.

315
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,320
Yeah, it looks so trippy.

316
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:00,720
Yeah.

317
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,860
Like, it explodes and then a house appears.

318
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,860
Yeah.

319
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,880
Yeah, but like, it just removes like the whole point of being creative in Minecraft.

320
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,540
Like...

321
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,520
Like...

322
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,120
It just like, removes the entire like, point of playing Minecraft.

323
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,920
Like, you're supposed to...

324
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,100
It's all about being creative and like, making whatever you want.

325
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,840
Um...

326
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,920
Yeah, what's the point of...

327
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,080
Yeah, it's just more...

328
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,460
I think I saw that they made this.

329
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,500
It's more so like, can I make something like this?

330
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,120
It's not more like, uh...

331
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,980
Not like, uh...

332
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:38,980
Oh...

333
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,180
Uh...

334
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,320
Oh, I don't wanna build anymore.

335
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,920
They're just like, can I do it?

336
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,360
You know?

337
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,560
Yeah.

338
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,700
It is, it's incredibly trippy.

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,460
Mac, thank you for the super chat.

340
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,460
Thank you, thank you.

341
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
With Doki pray on...

342
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,480
Oh yeah, Doki would eat...

343
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,840
Doki would 100% eat Doki Bird.

344
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,180
100%.

345
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,560
It's a Doki Doki world.

346
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,440
It's called Survival of the Doki.

347
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,960
Um...

348
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,280
Yeah, I like...

349
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,600
I like a lot of random stuff.

350
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,000
Um...

351
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,560
On Twitter.

352
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,900
Also, Rocky Raccoon's meta now.

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,620
And I'm sad.

354
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,000
One of my friends...

355
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,880
I asked my friend...

356
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,440
One of my friends.

357
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,620
I was like, how's the new season?

358
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,460
And they're like, it's so fun.

359
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,900
It's really fun right now.

360
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,620
Like, uh...

361
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,060
I was like, okay.

362
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,140
But like, do you think I'll like Marble Rivals?

363
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,480
New season.

364
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,900
And they're like, well, Raccoon's meta.

365
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,960
I was like, okay.

366
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,460
Okay.

367
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,200
It looks like I'm gonna be a raccoon, man.

368
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,740
It looks like...

369
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,240
No, they made it...

370
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,660
They made Raccoon just a little bit more skilled.

371
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,400
Because from what I've heard...

372
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,660
His left click, his heals...

373
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,020
His heals, you have to have the heal land on somebody to do more healing.

374
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,560
So like, it requires some form of aim now.

375
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,580
Instead of just randomly chucking the orbs at people.

376
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,920
So a lot of the shittier one-tricks who can't aim are not climbing a lot.

377
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,880
In our swap...

378
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,240
I saw...

379
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,780
Okay, I saw a game...

380
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,840
I was watching a game.

381
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,100
Yeah, you have to directly hit somebody to actually heal someone.

382
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,300
There are AoE healing, but it's not as good.

383
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,080
It's not as good as directly hitting someone with the heal.

384
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,420
So like, it's really funny.

385
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,480
Because I was watching a game.

386
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,080
And there was this raccoon one-trick.

387
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,040
That...

388
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,920
That was trying to play raccoon.

389
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,260
But obviously, he was a shitty player.

390
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,520
Like, he was a shitty player that can't aim.

391
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,140
So he was like a fucking raccoon crutch.

392
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,280
And then, he obviously was not doing so well.

393
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,420
And then he swapped to Cloak and Dagger for the auto-aim.

394
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,820
He swapped to Cloak and Dagger.

395
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,940
Because he couldn't fucking actually aim.

396
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,640
And then, like...

397
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,060
And this team was like...

398
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,120
Why are you not playing Rocket?

399
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,340
He's so...

400
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,460
Like, you have to have a Rocket to win.

401
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,480
That's the thing.

402
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,880
You need a Rocket to win the game.

403
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,660
Because he's like the must...

404
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,960
Must have healer on your team.

405
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,000
Like...

406
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,920
So...

407
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,980
So like, you have...

408
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,060
At least like, there's more skill now.

409
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,340
Involve your Rocket.

410
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,660
No, they increased the projectile speed of his heals.

411
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
Yeah, you need to actually have some...

412
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,100
Like, at least one hand to play Rocket now.

413
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,420
But he's still fucking easy as hell.

414
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,740
It's just, you know...

415
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,440
If it directly hits somebody, it does more healing.

416
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,540
No, I still don't respect Rocket 1 tricks.

417
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,700
I respect support players that can play Rocket.

418
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,840
Because they're usually the better support player.

419
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,200
They're usually just better at Rocket than Rocket 1 tricks.

420
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,480
But yeah, my friend was just like...

421
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,140
Yeah, Rocket's meta.

422
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,680
So I don't know how you're gonna feel about that.

423
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,920
And I was just like, well, I start...

424
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,880
I knew he was gonna be meta this season.

425
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,920
Because of early access.

426
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,020
Like, how strong he was in early access.

427
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,500
So I was just like, I'm not surprised.

428
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,640
But like, I'm still, you know...

429
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,280
I can still be sad.

430
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,700
I can still mourn.

431
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,680
Uh, no name.

432
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,480
Thank you for the super chat.

433
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,320
Thank you, thank you.

434
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,380
On the plus side, every Marvel hero got a buff buff from what I've heard.

435
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,140
Thank you for the super chat.

436
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,560
Thank you, thank you.

437
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,540
Yeah, we talked about it during last stream.

438
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,840
Last stream, we talked about it.

439
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,580
How like, all the other...

440
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,620
All the men got like a huge buff on their butts.

441
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,280
They all went to Brazil.

442
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,180
Yippee!

443
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,380
And Wolverine had several buffs.

444
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,660
Dude, the...

445
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,300
He had the front buff as well.

446
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,740
He got the...

447
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,540
He expanded the bulge while he was there.

448
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
He regenerated like a lizard and it got bigger.

449
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,400
But we talked about the...

450
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,480
Oh, for those who missed out on the hunting stream.

451
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,820
We were talking about it earlier today.

452
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,340
During the hunt stream.

453
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,240
I even linked it.

454
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,380
But basically...

455
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,760
Basically, so you guys know how...

456
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,700
So there's this buff.

457
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,820
I'll link it again.

458
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,960
There's this one.

459
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,880
And then there's also the Wolverine buff.

460
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,620
That, you know, they never mentioned too.

461
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,100
I love how they didn't even mention this in any patch notes.

462
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,740
It's just...

463
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,720
You know, usually developers would talk about like the cosmetic updates, you know.

464
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,200
You know, they didn't even bother to like say anything about cosmetic-wise.

465
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,280
It just...

466
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,360
It just like, you know, it was like a secret.

467
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,960
Like hotfix or some shit.

468
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,740
Behind the scenes hotfix.

469
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,520
But yeah, that's...

470
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,120
That's basically it.

471
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,300
The secret update.

472
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:19,680
Anyway.

473
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,820
Thank you for the super chat.

474
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,840
Thank you, thank you.

475
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,080
Hey Doki, currently at work right now.

476
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,300
But I want to say thank you for all the great content you gave us.

477
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,220
All the laughs you bring us.

478
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,400
And Marble Rivals, love you.

479
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,300
Thank you for the super chat.

480
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,280
Thank you, thank you.

481
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,800
I really appreciate that.

482
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,480
I hope you have a great day at work.

483
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,020
And yeah, don't have any bosses yelling at you.

484
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,900
That's the best part.

485
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,180
Thank you for the super chat.

486
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,700
Thank you, thank you.

487
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,820
Trey, thank you for the super chat.

488
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,540
Thank you, thank you.

489
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,800
Doki, wish me luck on my battle with cancer.

490
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,840
Thank you for the super chat.

491
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,500
Thank you, thank you.

492
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,240
You got this.

493
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,100
Good luck, man.

494
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,620
I hope everything will go well.

495
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,840
Thank you for the super chat.

496
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,880
Thank you, thank you.

497
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,420
What was I gonna say?

498
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,460
Don't worry, we dragoons are here for you.

499
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,740
Okay.

500
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,440
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

501
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,300
Okay, so I found out that...

502
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,300
You know how every year, Sanrio does the favorite...

503
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,900
Like, you know, the fan poll of which character is your favorite Sanrio character.

504
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,260
And it's now...

505
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,600
You know, they just launched the newest fan poll for Sanrio.

506
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,340
And apparently, there is...

507
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,120
It's the 40th...

508
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,480
Oh, it's the 40th anniversary for the Sanrio character ranking contest.

509
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:51,900
And apparently, Cinnamoroll has won the character ranking contest 7 years in a row now.

510
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,360
And people are mad.

511
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,760
No, it's 7...

512
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,400
He has had his 7th year win in a row.

513
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,320
And I saw this tweet.

514
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,040
And then I...

515
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:14,260
People are actually, like, uniting together to take down the dog.

516
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,500
I love this tweet.

517
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:21,340
I swear to fucking god, if you chocolate dice, let that greedy fucking capitalist dog win.

518
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,680
For the 7th year in a row, I'm going to commit an act of resistance.

519
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,060
And then, it's like an actual war right now.

520
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,180
It's like a fucking war going on in the Sanrio community.

521
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,480
And then, I love, like, the replies.

522
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,860
And, like, you know, it's like...

523
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,020
I will not be silenced.

524
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,440
Greedy or not, we will stand with our leader.

525
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,060
They will not silence me.

526
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,360
Doing my part as a Cinnamoroll truther.

527
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,700
Can't hear you.

528
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,340
My king is winning.

529
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,980
If you guys actually want to take down...

530
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,320
If you guys want to take down Big Dog...

531
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,260
The Big Dog upstate.

532
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,880
You have to all unite together under one character.

533
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,340
Like, that's the only way to win.

534
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,900
So, it's like, thank you for reminding me to vote for my president.

535
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,700
Like, you can't just say that and not, like, band together to vote for, like...

536
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,040
To vote for, like, one character.

537
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,680
Like, that's all you have to do.

538
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
And then...

539
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,260
And then, my favorite...

540
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,540
And then, there was a quote or tweet about it.

541
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,060
And I didn't know this was...

542
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,060
Okay, this is a fun fact, apparently.

543
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,740
But, the lore...

544
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,700
So, you know how Cinnamoroll doesn't look like a fucking dog?

545
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,960
So, Cinnamoroll was originally pitched as a bunny rabbit.

546
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,300
And the creator, Cinnamoroll, made, like, was like...

547
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,540
Yeah, Cinnamoroll's a bunny.

548
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,520
And then, Samuel was like...

549
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,980
Oh, we're not looking for a bunny right now.

550
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,600
We actually want a dog character.

551
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,780
A new dog character.

552
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,700
So then, the creator was like...

553
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,640
Okay, he's a dog.

554
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,520
So, yeah, you're a dog now.

555
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,900
And that's why he looks like that.

556
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,380
It's just that simple.

557
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,160
He was originally created as a fucking rabbit.

558
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,560
That's everything for money.

559
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,100
Yeah, because he doesn't look like a dog!

560
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,820
He doesn't look like...

561
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,780
He doesn't look like a dog.

562
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,360
He looks like a rabbit.

563
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,700
But, yeah, he didn't change anything.

564
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,620
He just said...

565
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,720
No, he's a dog now.

566
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,480
JK.

567
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,580
JK, guys.

568
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,140
I said rabbit?

569
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,200
No, no, I meant dog.

570
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,700
And then Samuel was like...

571
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:19,900
Okay.

572
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,780
They're just like...

573
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

574
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,780
Yeah, it's a dog.

575
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,380
Wait, I'll bring it back.

576
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:29,900
I need more water.

577
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,300
I forgot to refill my water.

578
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,340
I'll be right back, guys.

579
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,260
I'm back.

580
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,120
I'm back.

581
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,580
Hey, guys.

582
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,460
Thank you for the super chat.

583
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,160
Thank you, thank you.

584
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,260
Sorry for bringing this up again.

585
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,500
But people are locked out of the Lawn Winter server again due to a recent update.

586
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,620
Could you please take care of it later?

587
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,240
Thank you.

588
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,300
Alright, thanks for reminding me.

589
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,940
I'll go...

590
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,920
I'll go fix that right now, actually.

591
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,780
I can fix the Lawn Winter server.

592
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,640
I'll post this later, but we're gonna be doing...

593
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,360
The tomorrow at 5 PM on Sunday.

594
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,760
Just for the members, we're gonna do the final Battle Royale.

595
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,240
But this is all off-stream, so I'm not streaming it.

596
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,060
Just for you to let you guys know.

597
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,620
Cause I forgot to tweet...

598
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,120
Not tweet.

599
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,540
I forgot to make a post about it.

600
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,960
But just for you guys to know that it will be tomorrow at 5 PM.

601
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,940
Alright, let's see.

602
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,000
Oh, it expires in one day, everyone.

603
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,720
The server expires in one day left.

604
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,780
Okay, next due date.

605
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,000
I wonder if that's like...

606
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,420
Oh wait, no.

607
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,120
Is this 14th?

608
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,240
14th...

609
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
In the UK?

610
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,620
Or 14th NA?

611
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,940
Well, we're gonna find out.

612
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,920
We're gonna find out tomorrow if the server is still around.

613
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,100
We'll find out tomorrow.

614
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,560
Uh-oh.

615
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,880
Cause I used the GTX gaming for the server.

616
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:32,240
So I have no idea if it follows like UK hours or NA hours.

617
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,360
So we're gonna find out tomorrow if the server is still around.

618
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,150
Gamble time.

619
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,890
Yeah, I'm fixing it right now.

620
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,790
Oh, thank you for the...

621
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,810
Welcome to tomato farm.

622
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,750
Welcome, welcome.

623
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,130
I'm a

624
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,520
pee cat right now.

625
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,220
I'm a pee cat.

626
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,740
I didn't do much today either.

627
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
I think it's because of the blood moon, honestly.

628
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,060
I honestly...

629
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,320
I think it's just...

630
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,380
I think it's just the blood moon that I'm super eepy.

631
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,700
The loss of blood does that to a person.

632
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,520
I have not had zinc at all.

633
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,480
I should take my vitamins now that I mention it.

634
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,420
Gotta take my vitamins.

635
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,780
Yay, vitamin time.

636
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,410
Did my thing update yet?

637
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,390
Process has completed.

638
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:45,950
Okay.

639
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,770
Alright, the server's back.

640
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,810
I have...

641
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,110
I have...

642
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,810
I have updated the server for long winter.

643
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,630
You guys should have it back now.

644
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,990
There's something I want to talk about I forgot.

645
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,490
What do I want to talk about?

646
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,730
Was it DohKitty related?

647
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,420
Fuck, okay.

648
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,340
My memory's not good right now.

649
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,180
I think it's the lack of sleep.

650
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,580
No, it's just not the lack of sleep.

651
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,200
I've been sleeping a lot.

652
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,800
I think it's just I've been super tired.

653
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,620
Swarm, thank you for the super chat.

654
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,680
Thank you, thank you.

655
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,040
Yay, been a while since Good Night Dragons.

656
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,400
Anyway, DohKitty, when's the good movie watching on?

657
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,520
Thank you for the super chat.

658
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,780
Thank you, thank you.

659
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,760
Hmm, I don't know.

660
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,360
I don't know when.

661
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,540
I haven't...

662
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,320
Usually, when I decide...

663
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,700
I try to like...

664
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,860
Um, paste things...

665
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,060
From each other, like make sure it's not like back to back to back when I do member stuff.

666
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,440
In terms of like the...

667
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,780
The theming of what the member stream's gonna be.

668
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,440
So, when was the last time we had a movie watching on?

669
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,120
Let me double check.

670
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,380
Let me look at when the last time we had a movie watch along.

671
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,440
And then maybe...

672
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,580
It was two months ago.

673
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,740
Maybe next members.

674
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,320
Yeah, next members we can...

675
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,580
Um, I...

676
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,020
Since we did like four like back to back to back to back member stream though.

677
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,260
There's not gonna be a member stream for this week.

678
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,600
Or slash next week.

679
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,080
If you...

680
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,040
There won't be a member stream for next week.

681
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,680
Just cause like we had like non-stop member streams for like four weeks in a row.

682
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,500
So, I'm gonna like chill.

683
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,640
I'm gonna...

684
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,600
Next week there won't be a member stream.

685
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,340
But the week after that will be a member stream.

686
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,600
So, um...

687
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,180
I can make a good movies watch along for that one.

688
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,720
Yeah, it'll be a good...

689
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,800
A good movie.

690
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,500
But I...

691
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,960
But a good movie in my definition of a good...

692
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,670
It's gonna be...

693
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,360
What I think is a good movie.

694
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,260
What?

695
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:51,500
What?

696
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,140
I have good taste, guys.

697
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,120
My taste are pretty good.

698
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,320
What are you guys talking about?

699
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,540
I have really good taste in movie.

700
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,900
It's gonna be a good movie, guys.

701
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,480
Don't worry.

702
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,880
It'll be my definition of a good movie.

703
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,900
Thank you for the super chat.

704
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,240
Thank you.

705
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:18,940
Thank you.

706
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,860
Alright, Smetty.

707
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,700
Thank you for the super chat.

708
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,500
Thank you, thank you.

709
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,060
No name.

710
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,980
Thank you for the super chat.

711
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,840
Thank you, thank you.

712
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,240
I don't...

713
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,040
Sam will never do something like that.

714
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,080
They want...

715
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,760
They don't care.

716
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,820
They want you to fight.

717
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,840
They don't care.

718
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,940
They need you to fight.

719
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,940
The more you fight, the more you wanna buy.

720
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,460
And the more you wanna buy, the more money they'll make.

721
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,360
They don't fucking care.

722
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,140
Oh yeah!

723
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,780
Oh yeah, that's what I was gonna say!

724
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,760
Okay, so like...

725
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,120
I was thinking about how like...

726
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,500
Doe Kitty is like...

727
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,760
Okay, so you know like...

728
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,660
Hello Kitty is not an actual kitty.

729
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,060
Hello is like her first name.

730
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,760
And kitty is like her last name.

731
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,800
So like...

732
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,700
So, like, she's not an actual cat.

733
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,180
She's just, like...

734
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,880
Oh, sorry, it's Kitty.

735
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,800
Was it Kitty White?

736
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,740
Oh, sorry, Kitty White.

737
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,100
Sorry, Kitty is her first name and White is her last name.

738
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,700
I don't... I don't remember why it's, like, Hello Kitty.

739
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,640
Sorry, White, yeah.

740
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,420
Or is it Kitty is her last name?

741
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Fuck, I don't remember.

742
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,580
Is it Kitty?

743
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,040
Kitty is... Yeah, she's a cat-shaped human.

744
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,940
So, is either Kitty is her first name or last name?

745
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,760
I think it's Kitty.

746
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,000
Kitty is her last name, right?

747
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,920
Because her sister is Mimi Kitty.

748
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,120
Yeah, okay, so...

749
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,060
Yeah, Mimi Kitty, yeah.

750
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,060
So...

751
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,720
Wait, is it?

752
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,320
Mimi White is Hello Kitty's...

753
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,520
Is White her last name?

754
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,940
Okay, let me double check.

755
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,900
I need to make sure.

756
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,600
Because, like, Mimi is her sister's name.

757
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,880
And... Okay, Mimi White.

758
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,060
Okay, so yeah, so her full name is actually...

759
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,740
Kitty White.

760
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
That's her full name.

761
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,620
So, she's actually a cat-shaped human.

762
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,320
So, she's not like an actual cat.

763
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,020
Because, if you guys didn't know...

764
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,440
Hello Kitty owns an actual cat named Charming Kitty.

765
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,440
That looks just like her.

766
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,960
So...

767
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,620
So...

768
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:33,560
Hello Kitty owns an actual cat that looks just like her.

769
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,000
And her name is Charmy Kitty.

770
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,580
And...

771
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,920
Yeah, okay, so...

772
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,720
Yeah.

773
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,840
No, cause it's not like Goofy and Pluto.

774
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,780
Because Pluto is Mickey's dog.

775
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,880
Like, Hello Kitty...

776
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,520
Hello Kitty has her own pet cat.

777
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,220
And... The pet cat.

778
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,460
And then, the thing is, Pluto doesn't look like Goofy.

779
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,340
Her pet cat looks just like her.

780
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,880
Like, she even has, like, the bow and everything.

781
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,200
I used to really love... I used to really like Charmy Kitty.

782
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,240
When she first came out, she was incredibly popular.

783
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,440
And, like, she was, like...

784
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,620
She was, like, based off of more, like, bougie merch type deal.

785
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,060
Like, fan... Like, she was, like, fancier type merch.

786
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,200
Because, like, it was all about her being, like, a rich cat.

787
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,160
Like, a... Like, purebred cat or some shit.

788
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,100
But I wanted to talk about Charmy Kitty.

789
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,660
Cause I think it's, like, a char... Like, a...

790
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,780
Do-kitty, doki-bird situation.

791
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,680
Like...

792
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,720
What if I am Doki-bird's cat pet cat?

793
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,660
Do-kitty.

794
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,820
Yeah, oh yeah, so Charmy Kitty is, like, an Arista cat.

795
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,360
That's what I meant.

797
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,200
She's more so, like, an Arista cat.

798
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,980
And, like, what if I'm, like...

799
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,500
Just the pet cat of Doki-bird.

800
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,420
I could just be, like, a Charmy Kitty situation.

801
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,040
So... So, I'm a pet pet, exactly.

802
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,700
I'm a...

803
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,600
I am...

804
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,360
I am, like, we coexist in this universe.

805
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,120
This... The Doki universe.

806
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,540
New lore.

807
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,260
But yeah, I don't know.

808
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,720
Sanrio characters are fucking weird.

809
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,940
Let me... Alright, let me look at... Okay, all...

810
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,400
All Sanrio characters.

811
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,900
There's some really weird ones out there.

812
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,400
Okay, let's... Hello, Kitty.

813
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,760
Alright.

814
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,320
Let's see.

815
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,420
What the fuck is Hundrick?

816
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,620
There's Cake-chan?

817
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,340
There's a... There's a character that's just a cake?

818
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,200
She is a whole cake.

819
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,020
Cake-chan.

820
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,400
I don't keep up with some of these characters.

821
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,120
Like, Sanrio releases new characters every fucking year and I can't keep track of it anymore.

822
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,300
There's too many.

823
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:00,600
Okay.

824
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,340
New Sanrio character...

825
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,580
20 at 25.

826
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,680
Oops, sorry.

827
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,140
I forgot to...

828
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,300
Okay, Yoshi... Yoshi Kitty is selected for... For the 11th...

829
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:15,840
Wait, what?

830
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,580
Who's... Who's Yoshi Kitty?

831
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,420
The beloved... Inspired by international music icon Yoshiki has once again been selected...

832
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,000
Wait, there's a...

833
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,400
There's a Hello Kitty character based off a real person?

834
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,540
Who is the newest...

835
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,040
Oh!

836
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,280
Is that the newest?

837
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,860
No, that can't be the newest one.

838
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,500
Who's the newest Sanrio character?

839
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,400
I'm trying to look.

840
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,760
Newest... Newest...

841
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,360
Newest... Sanrio character.

842
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,780
Alright.

843
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,660
Oh, the Hana... Hana Maru Ba... Oh, I've seen this one!

844
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,320
This was created in 2022 before... Oh my god, the newest one was 2023?

845
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,580
I've seen this one around Japan.

846
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,700
I didn't realize it was a Sanrio character.

847
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,000
I thought they're... It's really cute.

848
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,540
It's like a little...

849
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,640
Ghost thing, right?

850
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,460
The...

851
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,500
This guy?

852
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,160
The Hana Mo...

853
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,340
Hana Mori...

854
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,340
Ba... Ba... Bake or Ba... I don't fucking...

855
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,520
I'm so bad at languages.

856
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,120
Hana Maru...

857
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,460
Bake?

858
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,460
I don't know.

859
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,400
I've seen like little gacha toys of it when I was in Japan.

860
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,260
I didn't realize it was a... It was a new Sanrio character.

861
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,540
I thought it was cute.

862
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,360
This little guy is pretty cute.

863
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,040
Look at him.

864
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,000
Or her.

865
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,740
It's pretty cute.

866
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,800
I like it.

867
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,560
I like the design.

868
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,260
What is it though?

869
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,240
It's a ghost with...

870
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,800
And then Hana Maru on his buttocks?

871
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,500
The fuck is that?

872
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:48,940
Oh!

873
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,920
It has the...

874
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,420
Oh!

875
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,640
It has the little...

876
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,080
The udon...

877
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,920
The fishcake thing.

878
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,420
It's a shy...

879
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,940
Maoru Maru is a shy, mysterious ghost...

880
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,600
Who appears without warning to give you a Hana Maru for your daily efforts.

881
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,080
Everyone has their own Hana Maru...

882
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:14,040
Bake that comes in a different form, like a future goal and an important memory...

883
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,160
That motivates them to keep working hard every day.

884
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Wait, that's cute!

885
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,320
What is this?

886
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,760
Hana Maru goods?

887
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,800
Oh my God!

888
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,260
Look, he's encouraging you to...

889
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,740
Buy more stuff for capitalism.

890
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,120
Good for you, Hana Maru.

891
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:30,960
Good.

892
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,980
Good for you, let's go.

893
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,060
They're like... I don't know what this means, but all I can think about is like...

894
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,320
He's like, yes, buy more stuff.

895
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,860
If you wanna be...

896
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:46,380
Hana Maru fan, remember to buy all these items from Sanrio.

897
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,720
I don't know what it actually says, but this is what it...

898
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,560
This is what it's saying to me.

899
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,800
It's like, yes.

900
00:39:59,240 --> 00:39:59,820
Yes.

901
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,600
Keep buying.

902
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,980
Yeah, I didn't know this was Sanrio.

903
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,640
I mean, I guess it does look like Sanrio stuff, like the Sanrio style.

904
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,800
Oh look, and he's like with all the other...

905
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,900
All the other characters.

906
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,820
Alright, who else is new?

907
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,240
Who else is the newest?

908
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,780
Okay, list of...

909
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,900
Sanrio next kawaii project.

910
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,280
Meet Sanrio's top 10 new characters.

911
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,440
Wow.

912
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,800
Who are they?

913
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,580
Oh my God, I'm so excited.

914
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,380
Oh, there was like a poll.

915
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,280
Oh!

916
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,220
So like, oh I see.

917
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,800
I see.

918
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,620
So there was like a merch poll.

919
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,000
And like, whoever wins the merch poll...

920
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,480
Becomes the next Sanrio character.

921
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,140
So like, Hana Maru won.

922
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,820
Oh man, okay, not gonna lie.

923
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,440
The other guys look so...

924
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,420
Pudu Pudu on pizza.

925
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,460
Is that...

926
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,400
What the fuck is...

927
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,680
What the fuck is Pudu Pudu on pizza?

928
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,380
It looks like poop.

929
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,680
It looks like...

930
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
It looks like fucking poop.

931
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,440
Okay, but like...

932
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,480
Hana Maru had like zero competition.

933
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,840
Like, I mean like...

934
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm sorry, but like what the fuck was his competition?

935
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,580
There's... Okay, I would say that Kumal...

936
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,380
Kumalino...

937
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,180
Was...

938
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:30,960
Is...

939
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,100
I think Kumalino is a pretty cute design.

940
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,440
But like...

941
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,680
Kaburen Boku Rabu...

942
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,460
Creamy Afternoon...

943
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,380
Haranochi...

944
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,840
Okay, that is...

945
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,680
That's not...

946
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,060
This is barely any competition for this guy.

947
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,360
Like, all the other guys are like...

948
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,380
So generic compared to like...

949
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,800
I guess like the concept of Hana Maru is really cute too.

950
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,440
Like the artwork.

951
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,440
But like all these other guys like...

952
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,260
What the fuck...

953
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,980
I think the bear is really cute.

954
00:41:59,260 --> 00:41:59,780
The...

955
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,020
The Kumalino is really cute.

956
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,460
Just cause I like the...

957
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,140
I just...

958
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,360
I think this little cute...

959
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,740
I like his little outfit there.

960
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,500
Yeah, he looks really dapper.

961
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,360
But everybody else was like...

962
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:11,860
Barely...

963
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,440
Like, what the fuck is...

964
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,240
Puraren Pukara...

965
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,000
Like...

966
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,160
Looks like...

967
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,280
He looks like a...

968
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,360
He looks like...

969
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,420
A psychopath.

970
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,500
Like...

971
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,540
He looks like someone...

972
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,040
Somebody...

973
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,640
Something you see in a creepypasta.

974
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,400
Yeah, I think the Kumalino is really cute.

975
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,800
But other than that, there's like barely any competition there.

976
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,080
I miss...

977
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,800
I'm...

978
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,080
I haven't bought Sanrio stuff in a long time though.

979
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,880
It's been a while since I bought Sanrio stuff.

980
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,400
At least just cause like...

981
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,560
I've just been so busy.

982
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,140
I don't really shop a lot either.

983
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,180
Yeah, like...

984
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,780
What the fuck?

985
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,280
This is barely a competition!

986
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,560
Like, look at this.

987
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,440
What kind of...

988
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
I'm just looking at like...

989
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,320
The competition on who would be like...

990
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,300
The next Sanrio...

991
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,620
Sanrio character.

992
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,520
And like...

993
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,440
There's barely...

994
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,080
This is...

995
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,720
Like, okay.

996
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,020
Yeah, it's literally the two bears.

997
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,480
The two bears, I would say...

998
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,600
Oh my god, the...

999
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,400
Fucking...

1000
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,200
Okay, like...

1001
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,300
Remember when I said the guy looks like a goddamn psychopath?

1002
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,160
Like...

1003
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,800
That looks like a fucking killer.

1004
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,860
Like, look at him.

1005
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,620
Look at that guy.

1006
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,680
It's just...

1007
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,260
He looks like he's gonna kill me.

1008
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,220
He's observing.

1009
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,080
He looks like he has committed...

1010
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:35,760
Like...

1011
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,660
He looks like the guy you first go to...

1012
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,000
As like the first...

1013
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,060
Like...

1014
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,900
The first suspect...

1015
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,620
Like, for a murder.

1016
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,200
He's a bad, bad man.

1017
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,280
He looks...

1018
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,900
He's watching me.

1019
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,120
He's seen too much.

1020
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,720
The prime suspect...

1021
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,480
Like, he'll be like...

1022
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,000
He has an alibi...

1023
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,380
But you know he did it.

1024
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:06,300
You know he fucking did it.

1025
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,760
But like, other than that...

1026
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,220
Like...

1027
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,320
This guy barely had...

1028
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,260
Like, cause the art style is really cute too.

1029
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,820
He knows.

1030
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,940
Yeah, like...

1031
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,940
Looking at all this competition...

1032
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,540
The only ones that I think...

1033
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,080
Could have beat...

1034
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,520
Hanamaru...

1035
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,980
Was literally the two bears.

1036
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,940
Like, oh my god, he's so cute though.

1037
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,560
The little outfit he has.

1038
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,140
He's like a little waiter too.

1039
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,880
He looks like a little waiter.

1040
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,700
Aw, he's so cute.

1041
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,640
I wish he won.

1042
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,380
I wish that the two little bears won.

1043
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,420
But I think it's just...

1044
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,940
I guess it looks a little too generic.

1045
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,940
Cause like, Hanamaru seems like a more...

1046
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,040
It seems like a more unique concept.

1047
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,120
And IP versus just two...

1048
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,000
Two fucking bears.

1049
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,100
Matrix, thank you for the super chat.

1050
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,140
Thank you, thank you.

1051
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,500
Your collab with Mint was funny, including two horses.

1052
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,480
And thank you for the super chat.

1053
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,240
Thank you, thank you.

1054
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,440
I'm glad you enjoyed the collab.

1055
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,860
I always love collabing with Mint.

1056
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,260
I feel like we just...

1057
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,960
We just bounce off each other really well.

1058
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,360
And then, like...

1059
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,680
I never know what to expect...

1060
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,720
When I collab with her.

1061
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:18,840
And...

1062
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,620
You know, things always go pretty crazy.

1063
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,720
Every time.

1064
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,700
Thank you for the super chat.

1065
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,680
Thank you, thank you.

1066
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,960
TastyDs, thank you for the super chat.

1067
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,960
Thank you, thank you.

1068
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,460
You're gonna do a sleep clinic to check your sleep apnea?

1069
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,120
I still haven't checked my sleep apnea.

1070
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,080
If I do have sleep apnea.

1071
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,140
But, like, the nasal...

1072
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,760
I don't do the nasal strips a lot.

1073
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:40,780
But...

1074
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,860
It does help my sleep a lot.

1075
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,400
Because, like...

1076
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,220
In the past, I used to sleep with my mouth.

1077
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,480
Like, through my mouth.

1078
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,260
But, ever since I did the nasal strip.

1079
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,220
Even without it.

1080
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,100
I started, like, breathing through my nose when I'm sleeping.

1081
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,400
So, when I go to sleep.

1082
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,460
I sleep with my mouth open.

1083
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,220
But, ever since I did the nasal strip.

1084
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,600
Like, I've been sleeping with my mouth closed.

1085
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,200
And just, like...

1086
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,080
You know...

1087
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,840
Just...

1088
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,280
Like, breathing through my nose when I'm sleeping.

1089
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,780
I still think I snore.

1090
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,060
I still think I snore.

1091
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,320
Because, when I do wake up.

1092
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,300
I do feel, like, dryness in my throat sometimes.

1093
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,600
So, I still think I'm still snoring.

1094
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,740
But, I'm not sure yet, obviously.

1095
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,700
Like, I don't fucking know.

1096
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,360
I live alone.

1097
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,860
I think the only way to test it out.

1098
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,060
Is if I, like, record myself on the phone.

1099
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,560
But then, I'm, like, worried about what I...

1100
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,200
Like, I'm worried.

1101
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,560
What if I just start sleep talking?

1102
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,660
And, like, I think it's really freaky.

1103
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,980
If I listen to myself sleep.

1104
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,080
And I just...

1105
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,940
I don't know.

1106
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,760
What if I just say something really fucking crazy in my sleep.

1107
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,860
And being, like...

1108
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,720
I'm gonna kill you.

1109
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,720
I don't know if I wanna, like...

1110
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,530
Experience that.

1111
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,800
I'm feeling, like...

1112
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,420
I'm gonna kill you.

1113
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,080
And all that.

1114
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,680
Like, that's, like, an actual...

1115
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,680
Like, not fear.

1116
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,780
But, like...

1117
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,420
That's something I don't wanna find out about myself.

1118
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,360
I...

1119
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,220
Cause, like...

1120
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,400
I don't...

1121
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:03,620
No.

1122
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,400
I know, like, I have...

1123
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,940
I...

1124
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,560
I have slept talk before in the past.

1125
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,400
So, I...

1126
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,620
I'm scared of, like, listening to my recording.

1127
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,720
And then, I just say some fucking demonic shit.

1128
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:18,680
Oh.

1129
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,880
But, thank you for the super chat.

1130
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,280
Thank you.

1131
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:21,820
Thank you.

1132
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,020
Also, I need to get...

1133
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,760
First, like...

1134
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,820
I need to get, like...

1135
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,660
I know I have more...

1136
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,980
Cough drops somewhere.

1137
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,220
Give me a sec, guys.

1138
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,920
Let me find some extra cough drops real quick.

1139
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,220
Give me a sec, guys.

1140
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,840
Trying to find my...

1141
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,140
I know I have extra cough...

1142
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,500
Cough drops?

1143
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,640
Yeah, there you go.

1144
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:46,840
There you go.

1145
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,720
Just had to get extra cough drops real quick.

1146
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,000
No, it's not food!

1147
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,880
Every time he hears, like, the crinkling of stuff, he thinks it's food.

1148
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,960
He thinks...

1149
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,180
He thinks it's fucking food.

1150
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,360
He's like, Are you trying to feed me?

1151
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,060
No, you...

1152
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,580
You hungry dog.

1153
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,440
It's not food.

1154
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,620
Can't open it.

1155
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,160
Oh my god.

1156
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,340
No, it's not food.

1157
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,680
You're not allowed to eat it.

1158
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,100
Food time?

1159
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,920
He's always hungry.

1160
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,300
I don't think he'll ever be full.

1161
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,900
He's, like, incredibly food motivated.

1162
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,980
Like, I think you can kidnap my dog if you just give him treats.

1163
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,380
Like, a lady actually tried to do that as a joke.

1164
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,260
I told you that story before, right?

1165
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:33,820
Yeah, I did.

1166
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,460
Like, there was this lady walking her dogs.

1167
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,020
And then, like...

1168
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,280
Dad really liked her.

1169
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,800
Because she had treats on her.

1170
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,240
And she was, like, walking...

1171
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,900
I think she was a dog walker or something.

1172
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,020
And she was, like, walking two dogs.

1173
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,320
And then, like, she was giving him treats and stuff.

1174
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,320
And then she was like, Haha, what if I just, like, take him away?

1175
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,160
Do you think he'll, like, look back at you?

1176
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,440
And he didn't look back.

1177
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,420
He didn't look back.

1178
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,560
So I think you can actually kidnap...

1179
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,200
I mean, I wouldn't say...

1180
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,800
He wouldn't feel like it's a kidnapping.

1181
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:21,120
He would just be like, Freedom!

1182
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:27,720
But yeah.

1183
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,260
Let's see.

1184
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:30,820
Aphelion.

1185
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:31,960
Thank you for the super chat.

1186
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,800
Thank you, thank you.

1187
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,480
Hey, Dokia.

1188
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,080
Love the Goodnight Dragoons streams.

1189
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,060
They're some of my favorites.

1190
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,060
Thanks for the good vibes.

1191
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:37,880
Thank you for the super chat.

1192
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,420
Thank you, thank you.

1193
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,140
I'm glad you've been...

1194
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,240
I'm glad you enjoy Goodnight Dragoons.

1195
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,720
And I'm happy to bring it back for you guys.

1196
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,280
I just figured, like, you know...

1197
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,260
I did took, like...

1198
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,260
A three-day...

1199
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,920
Was it three or four days?

1200
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,480
I don't remember.

1201
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,520
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.

1202
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,720
I streamed on Wednesday, right?

1203
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,480
Yeah, I did.

1204
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,620
I did a gorilla stream on Wednesday.

1205
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,020
But it's technically a four-day break.

1206
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,580
Well, it wasn't a break for me.

1207
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,020
It was a...

1208
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,780
Four -day locked in the Marvel Rivals dungeon.

1209
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,700
And getting nothing in return.

1210
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,900
So, I did feel bad.

1211
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:10,820
Because I didn't stream.

1212
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,340
For, like...

1213
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,980
Technically, I didn't stream for four days.

1214
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,080
So, I'm gonna schedule stuff for four days.

1215
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:16,780
So, I was like...

1216
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,540
Okay, I'm gonna...

1217
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,260
I'm gonna bring back Goodnight Dragoons.

1218
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,240
So, you don't hate me.

1219
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,260
You'll be like...

1220
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:23,960
This is it.

1221
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,300
This is the final straw.

1222
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,020
I'm gonna finally unsubscribe.

1223
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,320
And then, you see Goodnight Dragoons.

1224
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,220
And you're like...

1225
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,240
Never... Oh, never mind.

1226
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,940
All is forgiven now.

1227
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,040
The Dragoons have been appeased.

1228
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,280
All is...

1229
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,300
You have been forgiven.

1230
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,220
You are forgiven.

1231
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,920
Oh, yeah.

1232
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,620
Tyler, thank you for the super chat.

1233
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,780
Thank you, thank you.

1234
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,000
Word through the grapevine is your dignity.

1235
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,300
Can we be bought?

1236
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,160
Can we get a...

1237
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,520
Can we get a super chat, Tyler?

1238
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,520
Thank you, thank you.

1239
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,060
I mean, just...

1240
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,060
You think...

1241
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,440
You think that's how cheap my dignity is?

1242
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,660
I am a high-class cat.

1243
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,260
I am a house cat, alright?

1244
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,860
I come from a very...

1245
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,960
A very...

1246
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,640
Rich line of pure-blooded cats.

1247
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,220
You think $20 is enough for my dignity?

1248
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,600
I am an indoor-inside house cat.

1249
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,360
Alright?

1250
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1251
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,260
Thank you, thank you.

1252
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,120
A very prestigious...

1253
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,320
Mr.

1254
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:48,470
Stan, thank you for the stacca soup.

1255
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:51,030
Thank you, thank you.

1256
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:56,530
Anyway...

1257
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:58,770
Anyway...

1258
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,550
Let's see, where was I?

1259
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,530
Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

1260
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:08,550
Thank you, thank you.

1261
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,430
Aren't you a bit too intelligent to be a pet?

1262
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,410
I guess...

1263
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,370
Thank you for the super chat.

1264
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:17,290
Thank you for thinking I'm smart.

1265
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,990
I really appreciate it.

1266
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,690
Thank you for the super chat.

1267
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:21,590
Thank you, thank you.

1268
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,730
Akuma, thank you for the super chat.

1269
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,530
Thank you, thank you.

1270
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,810
Oh, it's based off of Ato's character too?

1271
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,110
Like the singer?

1272
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,310
The singer Ato?

1273
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:31,910
Ato?

1274
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:33,530
Is it really?

1275
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:34,350
I didn't know that.

1276
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:34,850
Hanamaru?

1277
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,510
I mean, to be fair, I found out about Hanamaru, like, just now.

1278
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,670
Like, not just now, but like, this week.

1279
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,130
When I was looking at the Sanrio character rankings.

1280
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,470
JL, thank you for the aka soup.

1281
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,610
Thank you, thank you.

1282
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:48,130
One...

1283
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:51,870
Piraka.

1284
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:52,710
There we go.

1285
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,050
Thank you for the aka soup.

1286
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:58,970
Thank you, thank you.

1287
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:06,930
Orca!

1288
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:08,870
Dorkness, thank you for the super chat.

1289
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:09,910
Thank you, thank you.

1290
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:11,670
What was I gonna say?

1291
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,490
There's something I wanna talk about, but I forgot.

1292
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,140
What did I wanna say?

1293
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,400
It was a good attempt.

1294
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,420
You know, you tried.

1295
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,300
Tried, good for you.

1296
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,160
Good for you.

1297
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,700
Oh my god, did you guys see?

1298
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,040
Did you guys see?

1299
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,380
Okay, I know I talked about...

1300
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,960
Okay, so you know how I mentioned about AI stuff?

1301
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,280
So...

1302
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,000
I thought it was really crazy that...

1303
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,640
There's, like...

1304
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,240
You can...

1305
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:45,860
Like, there was...

1306
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:49,420
Okay, I don't know if, like, people are actually allowed to do it.

1307
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,260
Because a judge was like, what the fuck?

1308
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:52,700
But...

1309
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,620
There was a video of this guy that tried to use an AI lawyer...

1310
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,260
To defend his case.

1311
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,220
And there's, like, an actual video of it.

1312
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,700
I was like...

1313
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:11,120
You know, I thought it was, like, some tech bro that tried to do it.

1314
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,680
Because, like, you know, it would make sense.

1315
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,500
But it's, like, some 74-year-old man.

1316
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,700
Like, some grandpa that tried to have, like, an AI to represent them as their lawyer.

1317
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:21,700
Like...

1318
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,880
I thought...

1319
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,920
Oh, I thought I was actually...

1320
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,760
I thought, like, it was...

1321
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,600
I was crazy.

1322
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,240
I was like...

1323
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,940
I mean, like...

1324
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:33,940
It's understandable.

1325
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,080
Like...

1326
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,440
It's free.

1327
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,340
But he got thrown out for it.

1328
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,580
Like...

1329
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,920
It's definitely cheaper than a real lawyer.

1330
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,580
I have to admit.

1331
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,020
It's definitely cheaper.

1332
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,120
But still, like...

1333
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,620
That's so stupid.

1334
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,740
Mizuki, thank you for the...

1335
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,920
Welcome to Tomato Fire.

1336
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,720
Welcome, welcome.

1337
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,100
Oh my god, they are taking our jobs.

1338
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,200
Oh my...

1339
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:00,500
Okay.

1340
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,380
And...

1341
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,380
And, like...

1342
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,780
I remember reading something about how there's gonna be a new season of South Park.

1343
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:07,800
But, like...

1344
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,880
You guys don't understand, like...

1345
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,840
How long it's been since South Park has released an actual new season.

1346
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,900
Because the creators were like...

1347
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,620
Yeah.

1348
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,340
It's really hard these days to write for a full season now.

1349
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:26,460
Because there's not enough content for us to make for each episode.

1350
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,980
So that's why we're doing these...

1351
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,120
That's why they've been doing the...

1352
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,400
The movie stuff.

1353
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,380
Because they were like...

1354
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,480
They were like...

1355
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:35,800
Yeah.

1356
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,940
It's so hard to find and make enough content for...

1357
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,900
For just...

1358
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,020
We're just so burnt out.

1359
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,980
So the fact that they're releasing a new...

1360
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,500
Too much shit has been happening.

1361
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,000
Every day.

1362
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,160
There is so much content.

1363
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,100
That there's just too much shit happening in this world now.

1364
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,300
That they're like...

1365
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:58,560
Oh, fuck.

1366
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,360
Oh, yeah.

1367
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,260
There's enough content for us.

1368
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,660
Also, thank you so much for the raid.

1369
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,060
I really appreciate it.

1370
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,300
Thank you so much, Azura.

1371
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,780
Thank you, thank you.

1372
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,760
But, yeah, like...

1373
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,700
I thought...

1374
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,840
I'm so excited.

1375
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,840
I love South Park.

1376
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,580
I'm sorry.

1377
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,980
I'm so...

1378
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,060
I'm so excited.

1379
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,300
Like, cause Canada's involved now.

1380
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,980
Apparently, there's gonna be an episode...

1381
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,680
Dedicated to Canada.

1382
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,840
So, like, I'm looking forward to see, like, what...

1383
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,160
What they're gonna do.

1384
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,340
And, like, the song that they used for the trailer for South Park...

1385
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,520
Was literally Blame Canada.

1386
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,240
But, like, spooky.

1387
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,880
It was like...

1388
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,440
Spooky Blame Canada.

1389
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:47,880
I'll show you guys.

1390
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,320
There you go.

1391
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,080
I'll link the trailer.

1392
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,160
The fact that they're actually making a new season is crazy.

1393
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,060
Like I said, they've, like...

1394
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,960
They said...

1395
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,040
The creators have said in interviews were like...

1396
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,520
We just don't have enough content.

1397
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,320
It's, like, to make a full season.

1398
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,000
So, we decided to do the movies.

1399
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,880
Cause then we can focus everything on just...

1400
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,300
On that one...

1401
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,780
Like, these, like, hour-long episodes and stuff.

1402
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:13,820
The horror...

1403
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:14,860
Horror...

1404
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,280
It's, like, you know, like the...

1405
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,080
Like...

1406
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,180
One, two, Freddy's coming for you.

1407
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,920
But it's like...

1408
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,000
Blame Canada.

1409
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,620
Blame Canada.

1410
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,620
But, yeah, I'm really...

1411
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,260
I'm really looking forward to the new season.

1412
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,860
Just cause Canada's gonna be involved in it.

1413
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:46,900
Hmm...

1414
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,660
Oh, yeah.

1415
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,840
You know...

1416
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,520
Speaking of...

1417
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,200
Speaking of, like, Canada...

1418
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,440
You know I made a joke in the hunting stream?

1419
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,680
How, like...

1420
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,700
My dog was trying to...

1421
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,900
Cross the border to Canada.

1422
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,240
You guys know that, like...

1423
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,760
Americans have been trying to, like...

1424
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,280
Illegally cross the border to live in Canada.

1425
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,720
And, like...

1426
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,520
We have, like, a Canadian border patrol now.

1427
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,980
To stop Americans from illegally coming into Canada.

1428
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,380
I thought it was so funny.

1429
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:28,520
We have people...

1430
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,560
I know...

1431
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,420
I know it's wild.

1432
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,860
Like, the Mounties are, like, patrol...

1433
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:41,160
Patrolling the Canadian-American border.

1434
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,320
To make sure no one crossed...

1435
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,660
The Americans don't cross over.

1436
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,200
It's so...

1437
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,700
It's so fucking funny to me.

1438
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,720
It's just like, what's up?

1439
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,320
They're like, alright, turn around.

1440
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,180
They're like...

1441
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,130
You guys hear about that?

1442
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:04,150
That's so wild.

1443
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,070
I know.

1444
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,010
That's actually...

1445
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,810
That's actually so wild.

1446
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,230
I just think it's so funny.

1447
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:15,430
That the Mounties are, like, patrolling the border right now.

1448
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:20,930
Yeah.

1449
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,690
Alright, I just wanted...

1450
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,950
I just wanted to mention that.

1451
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:29,650
Anyway.

1452
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:30,810
Anyway.

1453
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:32,230
Other than that...

1454
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,650
I don't know how to turn this table.

1455
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:37,830
Thank you.

1456
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,210
Thank you for the super chat, Mike.

1457
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,110
Thank you.

1458
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:41,990
Thank you.

1459
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,970
Anyway.

1460
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:43,710
Anyway.

1461
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:44,310
Anyway.

1462
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,490
Change of topic.

1463
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:51,450
But I just recently found out that Dreamworks was originally gonna make...

1464
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:55,350
Dreamworks was originally gonna make a McDonald's movie.

1465
00:59:55,670 --> 01:00:00,490
And there was, like, a leaked concept art of the Ronald McDonald's family.

1466
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:05,130
And I was like, that shit is so fucking scary.

1467
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,510
It's okay.

1468
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:09,190
I saw the...

1469
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,190
I saw...

1470
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:13,230
Like, it was, like...

1471
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:17,650
Dreamworks was concepting a McDonald's movie.

1472
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:21,390
And they're, like, you know, doing concept art and everything and pitching it and stuff.

1473
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,050
But they had the rights to do it.

1474
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:24,450
And...

1475
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,390
Oh my god.

1476
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,430
Okay, let me show you the concept art.

1477
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:32,230
It looks so fucking...

1478
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,150
Like...

1479
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:34,490
That looks like...

1480
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:35,990
It looks so scary.

1481
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,290
Like...

1482
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:38,230
I'm...

1483
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,410
Okay, but...

1484
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:42,230
Also, it's really fucking funny that there's, like, um...

1485
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,730
They made, like, you know, the dream...

1486
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:46,230
The, like, Pixar mom.

1487
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:47,750
The Pixar mom.

1488
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:53,110
Even though this is Dreamworks, they made the Pixar mom of, like, Ronald McDonald's wife.

1489
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:58,150
With the hourglass figure and everything.

1490
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,030
But oh my god, this is terrifying.

1491
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,670
Like, this is actually...

1492
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,190
Oh yeah, the hot clown kink.

1493
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:08,250
No, you...

1494
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,850
I know that's a...

1495
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,990
I know that's somebody's kink right there.

1496
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:13,430
When they want their...

1497
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:16,450
When they want their women to dress up like a clown.

1498
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:24,890
Stay away from his wife.

1499
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,910
I'm loving it, alright.

1500
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:30,250
But, like, his children, though.

1501
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,910
Like, what the fuck is wrong with his son?

1502
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:35,450
Like, what is...

1503
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,010
Oh my god.

1504
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,050
I don't know, his children...

1505
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:44,290
His children's freaky as hell.

1506
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,690
His son actually got that...

1507
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,430
His son looks like he was not born right.

1508
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,310
That's all I can say.

1509
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:58,050
There's something wrong with that boy.

1510
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:01,030
I'm loving it, alright.

1511
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:03,290
I don't...

1512
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,270
I don't...

1513
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:05,510
I don't think he's okay.

1514
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,770
Would you...

1515
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,470
That kid ain't right, boy.

1516
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:10,210
That kid ain't right.

1517
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:11,710
Stay away from that boy.

1518
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:18,690
Let's see.

1519
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:19,530
Stub!

1520
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:20,690
Thank you for the super chat.

1521
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,710
Thank you, thank you.

1522
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,170
Toki, prepare a serious chat.

1523
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,050
Oh, hey!

1524
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,570
Thank you again for the rate.

1525
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:26,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1526
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:27,630
Thank you, thank you.

1527
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:28,210
Medi!

1528
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:29,510
Thank you for the super chat.

1529
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:30,630
Thank you, thank you.

1530
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,950
Do you still buy any plushies for yourself even when dad is destroying around?

1531
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,090
Thank you for the super chat.

1532
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:35,890
Thank you, thank you.

1533
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,410
Yes.

1534
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,270
Because, like, it's so weird.

1535
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,070
He's so weird.

1536
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:45,270
Okay, so if I don't, like, specifically tell him not to...

1537
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:47,470
Okay, so I have a giant ass otter.

1538
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:53,670
I can't show the otter, by the way, because it's sort of, like, I bought it at a place near me.

1539
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:57,670
So, like, if you see the otter, people will know where I...

1540
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:03,970
People will, like, know where to get it.

1541
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:14,530
But I have a giant ass otter plushie that I, like, sleep with.

1542
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,710
Like, I cuddle it and everything.

1543
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:18,150
And, yeah, it's too local.

1544
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:20,670
So, like...

1545
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:24,010
So...

1546
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:29,730
So, like...

1547
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,650
I was, like, I told my dog.

1548
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,430
I was, like, no!

1549
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:33,490
No!

1550
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:36,330
Like, maybe I can look at it and I'll be, like, no!

1551
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,770
And then he has not done anything with the plushie.

1552
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:42,110
But, like, if I don't give him a warning...

1553
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,330
If I don't give him any warnings at all, he will destroy it.

1554
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:48,530
So, like, obviously, he destroyed the dragoon plushie.

1555
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,170
Like, your ancestor.

1556
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:51,570
Because, I...

1557
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,350
You know, he fucking...

1558
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:57,250
He fucking broke into one of the boxes and just stole it.

1559
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,990
And was, like, pretending to be super sneaky about it.

1560
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:02,330
So, um...

1561
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:05,810
So, like, he, like, fucking ripped it apart and everything.

1562
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,170
So, obviously, like, he...

1563
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:08,950
I didn't give him the warning.

1564
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:13,170
I also have, like, a sleeping Pikachu that's sitting on my windowsill.

1565
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,170
And I literally showed it to him.

1566
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,030
And I was, like, no!

1567
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,130
No!

1568
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:18,510
No!

1569
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,570
And then he hasn't touched it.

1570
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:21,870
He hasn't touched it at all.

1571
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:24,790
And then the windowsill is, like, you know, at, like, I love...

1572
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:27,210
Like, it's not even, like, far.

1573
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,450
It's not even hard to reach.

1574
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:29,950
He can literally grab it if he wants to.

1575
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,010
But he doesn't do it because I already warned him.

1576
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:33,130
I was, like, you don't...

1577
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:33,690
Because he knows.

1578
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,750
He knows when he fucked up.

1579
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:39,330
Because when I found out, he, like, stole the dragoon plushie.

1580
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,010
He instantly hid from me.

1581
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,190
And, like, looked at me, like, guiltily.

1582
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,170
Like, he was, like...

1583
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:45,750
I'm sorry.

1584
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:48,690
I'm sorry.

1585
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,250
He's, like...

1586
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:54,810
Me.

1587
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:56,790
Me.

1588
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:57,990
I'm sorry.

1589
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,850
My bad.

1590
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,230
But, yeah.

1591
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:09,450
So, he doesn't...

1592
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:10,050
He only...

1593
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:12,850
He won't do it if I, like, specifically tell him not to.

1594
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:15,090
Because I think he's scared of, like, what happened.

1595
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:16,230
Because, yeah.

1596
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:16,930
He's, like, oh, no.

1597
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,730
I got the warning.

1598
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,510
Yeah, the guilty dog look.

1599
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:21,510
And everything.

1600
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:31,970
Okay,

1601
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,410
but I do that when I'm not sleeping.

1602
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:49,790
Like, if I can say that when I'm not sleeping, imagine the things I could say when I am sleeping.

1603
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,790
Because those aren't my intrusive thoughts.

1604
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,110
I feel like...

1605
01:05:55,110 --> 01:06:00,850
I'm just worried that if I'm sleep talking, I'd say, like, inner deep thoughts that even I didn't.

1606
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:05,970
Like, the thoughts that, like, I don't think about, but it's, like, in my soul.

1607
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:15,510
Like, what if, like, I listen to the recording, and then I'm, like, so this is how I...

1608
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:21,430
This is how the assassination of JFK happened.

1609
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:23,930
Like that shit.

1610
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:24,650
Like that.

1611
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:29,550
Like, I'm, like, really worried.

1612
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:32,530
I'm, like, what the fuck would I say when I...

1613
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,730
The real thoughts.

1614
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:35,530
Wait.

1615
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:36,550
What the...

1616
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,410
I don't know.

1617
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:40,010
I don't know what you're talking about.

1618
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:45,790
Anyway.

1619
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:48,870
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

1620
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:49,490
Thank you.

1621
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:50,730
Thank you.

1622
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,670
CJ, thank you for the super chat.

1623
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:57,050
Thank you.

1624
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:57,870
Thank you.

1625
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:00,830
Confidential information.

1626
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,730
What does that mean?

1627
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:07,750
I guess we'll never know, because I'll never record myself sleep talking.

1628
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:13,430
Well, the official documents are out now.

1629
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,450
That's what you think.

1630
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:17,870
Yeah, sure.

1631
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:18,650
Official.

1632
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,210
Tyranna, thank you for the super chat.

1633
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:26,630
Thank you.

1634
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:27,950
Thank you.

1635
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:32,130
Doki, we aren't like dad who could leave you that easily.

1636
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:32,970
Thank you for the super chat.

1637
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,950
Thank you, thank you.

1638
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,650
Megan, thank you for the super chat.

1639
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:37,390
Thank you, thank you.

1640
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:38,090
Hey, Doki.

1641
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:40,490
Been a while since I've seen a stream and forgot how enjoyable they are.

1642
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,130
Also, do you think I could tug your...

1643
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:44,730
How do you pronounce it?

1644
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:46,110
Ahoge?

1645
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,770
Is that how you pronounce it?

1646
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,030
Ahoge?

1647
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:52,470
Well, it's not...

1648
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,250
Which one?

1649
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:54,070
The one at the bottom?

1650
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:56,670
No.

1651
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:01,670
Ahegao.

1652
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:02,770
Ahoge.

1653
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:05,530
Ahe...

1654
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:06,350
Ahe...

1655
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:07,010
Ahe...

1656
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:08,830
Ahegao.

1657
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:10,810
Um, what?

1658
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,450
Wait, what?

1659
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:17,250
What did I say?

1660
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:19,950
I was just pronouncing stuff on the...

1661
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:20,510
I was just...

1662
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:21,650
But now...

1663
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:21,790
Oh, no.

1664
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:22,630
I got baited.

1665
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:24,150
I got fucking baited.

1666
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:25,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1667
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:26,670
Thank you, thank you.

1668
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,850
What was that in the super chat?

1669
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:31,910
Mizuki, welcome to the tomato farm.

1670
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:32,250
Welcome,

1671
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:40,290
welcome.

1672
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,270
Moro, thank you for the super chat.

1673
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,250
Thank you, thank you.

1674
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,570
I think they just can't compete what crazy reality is at the moment.

1675
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:48,370
Oh, that's true.

1676
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:49,830
Every day is like...

1677
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:52,450
New shit coming up.

1678
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:53,350
Oh my god!

1679
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,430
Okay, I don't watch Aisho Speed.

1680
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:58,330
But like, I saw clips of his trip to China.

1681
01:08:58,830 --> 01:08:59,990
And like, oh my god.

1682
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:03,290
I felt so homesick watching it.

1683
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,330
Cause like...

1684
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,730
Oh my god.

1685
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,330
Like, okay, there's a lot of stuff that...

1686
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:10,790
Like, it's been a while since I've been back to China and Hong Kong.

1687
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:12,170
So like...

1688
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:12,950
The...

1689
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:16,910
I was feeling like incredibly like homesick watching it.

1690
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:18,210
And...

1691
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:19,810
And...

1692
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:21,450
And like...

1693
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,810
Like, the stuff he was showing.

1694
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,170
Like, I did not realize there were like...

1695
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,770
Oh my god, there's like so many new things back like now.

1696
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:29,290
Because it's been like, I think...

1697
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:33,690
More than six years, I think.

1698
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:35,990
More than five years since I've been back.

1699
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,570
And it made me incredibly homesick.

1700
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,550
I thought it was so sweet.

1701
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,930
Okay, so like...

1702
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:45,750
There was this girl.

1703
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:46,730
I think this was during...

1704
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:47,330
In Hong Kong.

1705
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,090
When she was...

1706
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:51,530
When he was in...

1707
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:55,710
Okay, apparently the officials in Hong Kong were like, Speed did everything in China.

1708
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:56,890
We didn't arrange anything for him.

1709
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:57,970
This is unacceptable.

1710
01:09:59,090 --> 01:09:59,850
But like...

1711
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:02,330
Did you guys see the one about how...

1712
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,330
He like...

1713
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:04,170
There was this girl.

1714
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:05,510
I think this was from Hong Kong, right?

1715
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,210
And he was like...

1716
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,150
This girl and her...

1717
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:11,410
Like, he was with this girl.

1718
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:14,290
And like, the chat was being like really mean to the girl.

1719
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,750
Because like her voice was like super high-pitched and stuff.

1720
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:18,190
And he was like, don't let...

1721
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,330
Don't let anyone say that about you.

1722
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:21,150
And like...

1723
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,330
Just be stronger.

1724
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:25,230
And I was like, oh my god, that's so fucking sweet.

1725
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:25,970
I was like...

1726
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,070
That's so...

1727
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:29,610
Yeah, that was really sweet of him.

1728
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:30,630
And then...

1729
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:36,390
I didn't realize we have flying cars.

1730
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:45,190
When they showed him on a flying car, I was like, we have that?

1731
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:52,390
I was like, wait, what?

1732
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:54,590
We have flying cars?

1733
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:56,450
Since when?

1734
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:01,450
And then it was basically like...

1735
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:07,030
Okay, but to be fair, the flying car was like basically a giant fucking drone that you can sit on.

1736
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:11,490
Yeah, it was like...

1737
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:13,270
Okay, so the base is a car.

1738
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:14,630
Like the car thing.

1739
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:18,230
And then they just put like drones at the bottom.

1740
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,690
And then it just...

1741
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:20,170
It's like...

1742
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:22,130
It's like, you know, like Amazon delivery.

1743
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:25,570
Where you're delivering, you know, drones are delivering packages.

1744
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:28,870
So like, drones can now deliver a fucking human being.

1745
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:33,950
It was like, it's a giant fucking drone.

1746
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:40,810
Now we can deliver you.

1747
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:41,410
Wait, let me...

1748
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:42,050
I'll show you guys.

1749
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:43,310
I saw the clip.

1750
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:44,970
I was like, what the fuck?

1751
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:47,430
That shit looks...

1752
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:48,150
Okay, not gonna lie.

1753
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:51,030
That shit looks so fucking scary.

1754
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:55,970
A human-sized drone.

1755
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:57,270
Alright, let me show you.

1756
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:01,110
You became the first streamer to drive a fly.

1757
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,850
Like, it's just a drone.

1758
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,850
It is.

1759
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:04,870
Oh, wait, sorry.

1760
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:05,650
That's subpar.

1761
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:08,590
I linked you guys to subpar trailer again.

1762
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:10,570
Okay, wait.

1763
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,250
Here we go.

1764
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:14,590
Look at this.

1765
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,370
Look at this.

1766
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:17,870
It's literally...

1767
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,090
It's literally...

1768
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,330
It's literally...

1769
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:25,290
It's a fucking Amazon drone delivering a person to you.

1770
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:33,450
Bro, it's like...

1771
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,890
The inside is like a car.

1772
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:38,930
It's literally...

1773
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:39,350
Yeah.

1774
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:42,130
That looks so scary though.

1775
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:44,330
Like, if I was like in that...

1776
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:49,670
I don't know if I can say it's safer than a helicopter.

1777
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:52,210
I think like...

1778
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:53,650
I don't know.

1779
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:55,410
I don't know.

1780
01:12:55,910 --> 01:13:01,570
No, cause like a helicopter is like a lot different from what the fuck...

1781
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:03,390
Whatever I'm looking at right now.

1782
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,930
It's an inverted helicopter.

1783
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:12,910
What if we just...

1784
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:14,970
No, it's literally a drone.

1785
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,390
I don't know.

1786
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,830
I can't tell if it's safer.

1787
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,550
I legitimately cannot tell.

1788
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:26,950
Because like...

1789
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:28,990
Helicopters are also like...

1790
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:29,510
I don't know.

1791
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:32,550
I don't find helicopters very safe either.

1792
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,030
It was very interesting.

1793
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:38,850
I think the whole...

1794
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,850
I show speed...

1795
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:41,430
Cause I...

1796
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:44,670
I'm not the audience for speed streams.

1797
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:47,010
Obviously, he's like...

1798
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:47,970
I know he's like...

1799
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:50,130
He seems like a really genuine guy though.

1800
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,130
Cause like, you know...

1801
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:56,910
I feel like the content he does is incredibly creative.

1802
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:58,970
And like very...

1803
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:02,670
Fun to watch where he travels around to different countries.

1804
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:06,650
And you know, experiencing their culture and everything.

1805
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:10,430
And actually like seems interested in learning about other people's cultures.

1806
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,250
And like...

1807
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,030
I wish...

1808
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:15,870
In my time, we had like...

1809
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:16,970
For like the generation...

1810
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:19,390
Of content creators that I watched.

1811
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:20,770
That...

1812
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:24,170
We had more people like speed.

1813
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:25,410
Because like...

1814
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:26,090
You know...

1815
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:28,250
He seems like a very genuine person.

1816
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:30,410
And his content is like...

1817
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:30,910
You know, so...

1818
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:32,670
His content, he's actually...

1819
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:35,650
He's actually like trying to like...

1820
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,710
Introduce different cultures and stuff.

1821
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:38,850
To like different...

1822
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:39,970
To like...

1823
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,330
To people around the world.

1824
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:43,470
And yeah, he created like...

1825
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:45,070
And like he has fans from...

1826
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:45,870
Yeah, we had...

1827
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:48,070
We had Jake and Logan Paul.

1828
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:58,590
Yeah, I like that he highlights like the different cultures.

1829
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:02,790
Like different cultures and stuff from all the places he visited and stuff.

1830
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:05,630
But yeah, it was so interesting.

1831
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:06,770
I really...

1832
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:08,510
I enjoyed the clips I saw.

1833
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,870
Of his entire trip throughout...

1834
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:13,110
Of his entire trip in China.

1835
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,790
It was like...

1836
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:15,470
It was very interesting.

1837
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,030
Like it would pop up in my Twitter feed.

1838
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:19,210
And I got like actually homesick.

1839
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:20,370
I was like, oh my gosh.

1840
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:22,830
I miss living there.

1841
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:25,290
And like obviously...

1842
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:27,310
Like I miss the malls.

1843
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,110
The malls were fucking crazy back there.

1844
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:37,330
No, he's not...

1845
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:37,910
He's like...

1846
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:38,690
He's an actual...

1847
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:41,070
He's a really good...

1848
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,610
I think he's good at...

1849
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:45,550
He's really, really good at what he does.

1850
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:48,800
And he's like...

1851
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:51,250
He likes to communicate and like...

1852
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,870
Talk to people from around the world.

1853
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:56,370
Like he unites cultures from around the world and stuff.

1854
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:59,910
I wanna go back to Hong Kong this year.

1855
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,610
But like I also like wanna...

1856
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:03,930
You know, I'm like...

1857
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:07,190
I wanna go back when things are much more calm.

1858
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:09,470
In my life.

1859
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:14,370
When things are more calm in my life, then I'd go back.

1860
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:15,470
But right now...

1861
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:19,070
Right now, I'm obviously like...

1862
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:21,010
I'm always busy almost every day.

1863
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:25,470
And like, you know, things have been like...

1864
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:27,050
You know, so chaotic and stuff.

1865
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,430
So yeah, I'll go back one day.

1866
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:29,970
One day.

1867
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:31,250
I wanna go back this year.

1868
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:33,250
Let's see.

1869
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:35,570
Let's...

1870
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:39,350
I have no...

1871
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,530
What?

1872
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,050
What is this?

1873
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:44,250
Is this the one where he like...

1874
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:45,590
Kills him?

1875
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,090
Oh yeah!

1876
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:49,330
Oh yeah!

1877
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:50,530
I've seen it.

1878
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:51,550
I've seen it.

1879
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,130
And he was like...

1880
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:54,090
What the fuck?

1881
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,790
I've seen that clip.

1882
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:59,310
Thank you for the super chat.

1883
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:00,670
Thank you, thank you.

1884
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:03,210
And everybody was like...

1885
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,410
What the fuck?

1886
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:09,130
Like, you didn't know what the fuck happened.

1887
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:10,450
Yeah, I sent a...

1888
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:14,530
I sent a clip of it.

1889
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:16,550
That shit was crazy.

1890
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,130
That shit was fucking crazy.

1891
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:21,750
I remember seeing it.

1892
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:25,210
If you ever thought wrestling was fake...

1893
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:36,170
Let's see.

1894
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:39,610
What?

1895
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:45,370
Thank you for the super chat.

1896
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:46,390
Thank you, thank you.

1897
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:48,290
I don't know what that was referenced to.

1898
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:49,910
I've read the super chat too late.

1899
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:50,410
I'm sorry.

1900
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:51,420
I'm sorry.

1901
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,390
Cat fake gravity.

1902
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:57,170
He killed that kid.

1903
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,010
It...

1904
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,950
Vivas, thank you for the super chat.

1905
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:04,970
Thank you, thank you.

1906
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:09,090
I was at a birthday party for my friend's 30th birthday today and someone gave him your merch.

1907
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:09,810
The body pillow.

1908
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:16,270
That's so evil.

1909
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,150
I love it.

1910
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:20,810
His mother and grandpa were confused.

1911
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1912
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:23,410
Thank you.

1913
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:24,610
Oh my...

1914
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:26,570
That's so fucking evil.

1915
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:27,930
But like...

1916
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:30,330
That's a dragoon right there.

1917
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,830
Thank you for the super chat.

1918
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:37,190
Thank you, thank you.

1919
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:40,390
Good for him.

1920
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:41,610
I hope he had a good birthday.

1921
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:44,590
In front of the whole family.

1922
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:50,490
Oh my god.

1923
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:53,570
A soccer clip just showed up on my...

1924
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:57,210
On my Twitter timeline.

1925
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:03,090
And I just remembered about the fact that Ronaldo is a fucking character in the fighting game.

1926
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:06,630
Did you guys see the trailer of the Ronaldo character?

1927
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,390
And like his movesets and everything.

1928
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:11,650
Alright, Ronaldo...

1929
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:13,490
Is it Ronaldo or is it...

1930
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:16,330
Oh yeah, it was Fatal Fury, right?

1931
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:18,110
Yeah.

1932
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:20,110
They showed a trailer...

1933
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:21,530
Of Ronaldo.

1934
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:24,570
Or not Fatal Fury.

1935
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:25,290
Yeah, Fatal Fury.

1936
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:26,510
Yeah, here's the trailer.

1937
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:28,110
I thought it was...

1938
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:30,590
It was so funny.

1939
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:34,750
It's not even him.

1940
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:38,270
He doesn't even voice act his own character.

1941
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,610
Who the fuck is Juan Felipe Sierra?

1942
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,190
Like...

1943
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:45,490
Bro, he doesn't even...

1944
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:48,030
Bro, you can't even do the bare minimum.

1945
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:50,070
Of voice acting yourself?

1946
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:50,870
Like...

1947
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:55,070
He doesn't...

1948
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:57,910
I was like, who the fuck is Juan Felipe Sierra?

1949
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:58,990
Like...

1950
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,490
Why does it look so...

1951
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:01,310
Why does it look good?

1952
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:04,610
Because Ronaldo doesn't voice act his own fucking character.

1953
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:10,490
It's funny.

1954
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:12,050
That's crazy.

1955
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:13,290
I'm like...

1956
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:15,050
When I saw that trailer...

1957
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:20,790
He was...

1958
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,950
He just got into a video game.

1959
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:26,210
Well, I know for sure what...

1960
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:26,390
What...

1961
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:28,350
Like...

1962
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:29,390
How many people are gonna...

1963
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:32,150
Like, who are the players are gonna play this game just for Ronaldo?

1964
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,110
It might not even be...

1965
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,490
Like, they might not even be, like, fighting game fans.

1966
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,210
They're just playing it for Ronaldo.

1967
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:44,900
That's crazy.

1968
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,980
I'm re-watching the trailer.

1969
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,280
I'm re-watching the trailer right now.

1970
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,840
Okay, the finisher looks so cool, though.

1971
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,140
Imagine getting your ass beat by fucking Ronaldo.

1972
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:00,900
Alright,

1973
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:08,460
where was I?

1974
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:21,640
Um...

1975
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1976
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:23,700
Machato Super...

1977
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:25,840
Thank you, thank you.

1978
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:26,900
LostPlanet2?

1979
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,440
What's that?

1980
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,240
It's a third person shooter.

1981
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,000
That's sold over 2.

1982
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:37,240
Why is that mixed reviews?

1983
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,500
Is it, like...

1984
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,400
Are they dinosaurs?

1985
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:40,880
Is this a mecha game?

1986
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:41,940
What is this?

1987
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:45,480
Why is it mixed re...

1988
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,440
Hold on.

1989
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:53,220
Uh...

1990
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:54,900
Wait, it's not even available.

1991
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,440
Wait, you can't even get this.

1992
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:06,200
Wait, we're temporarily disabling the purchase option on Steam while we investigate the matter.

1993
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,500
We'll keep you informed.

1994
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,400
Wait, what happened?

1995
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:09,860
Wait.

1996
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,140
Wait, it's been...

1997
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,200
How long has this game been delisted for?

1998
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,340
Hold on.

1999
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,620
Wait, it's been...

2000
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:19,600
Yeah, it's delisted.

2001
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:25,660
It's been delisted for at least, like, a month plus now.

2002
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,340
It's literally unplayable.

2003
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,220
I feel nothing but rage.

2004
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,140
Caveat for leaving this game for dead.

2005
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,620
Oh my God, what happened?

2006
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:38,880
LostPlanet...

2007
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,440
I'm looking at LostPlanet2.

2008
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,700
Apparently, this game has been, like, delisted for, like...

2009
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,520
Like, almost two months now.

2010
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:51,100
Yeah, like, multiplayer is unplayable.

2011
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:52,080
I'm sorry.

2012
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:56,500
I'm sorry, man, that you just found out that the game doesn't exist anymore.

2013
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,360
I'm sorry.

2014
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:09,160
I'm sorry that this is how you found out you're sharing your love for your game and now the game doesn't exist anymore.

2015
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,800
This is how you had to find out.

2016
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,960
Valentine, thank you for the super chat.

2017
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,080
Thank you, thank you.

2018
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,320
I haven't heard...

2019
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,280
I've heard of clown phobia, but not clown.

2020
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:29,000
Yeah, no, there's apparently a surprising amount of people that are sexually attracted to clowns.

2021
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,160
Thank you for the super chat.

2022
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,100
Thank you, thank you.

2023
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,180
No, it's a real thing.

2024
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,320
It's actually, like, a real...

2025
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,820
I think it's because of, like, Harley Quinn, honestly.

2026
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:43,600
I won't be surprised if, like, Harley Quinn helped with that.

2027
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,980
Thank you for the super chat.

2028
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:46,820
Thank you, thank you.

2029
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:48,920
Only sexy clowns.

2030
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,300
But, like, what makes a sexy clown sexy?

2031
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:58,620
Let's see.

2032
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,380
Where was I?

2033
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:00,440
Let's stop.

2034
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,360
Thank you for the super chat.

2035
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,380
Thank you, thank you.

2036
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:06,600
I remind you that according to the X-Men movies, JFK was a muni.

2037
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,480
Also, it's, like, 100 degrees where I am.

2038
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,600
Please send some of the Canadians Canada coldness down here.

2039
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:12,540
Thank you for the super chat.

2040
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,620
Thank you, thank you.

2041
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:21,800
Speaking of X-Men, I just found out that, like, Charles Xavier has been able to walk for years now.

2042
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,820
Like, why would you do that to him?

2043
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,740
How dare you make him walk?

2044
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,920
I can't believe it.

2045
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:34,940
I was so looking forward to play him in a wheelchair.

2046
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:37,260
Like...

2047
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,860
How dare you cure...

2048
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:43,980
How dare you cure his disability?

2049
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:49,800
Bro, I was so looking forward to play

2050
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,520
him in his wheelchair.

2051
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:56,080
What happened?

2052
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,960
You could have represented the wheelchair gaming.

2053
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,400
How dare they make him walk?

2054
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,300
Like, why does he have...

2055
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:03,940
I don't understand.

2056
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,680
Make him sit down.

2057
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:06,920
Someone...

2058
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,460
Someone get his back.

2059
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:11,660
Imagine the movement.

2060
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,280
I swear to God.

2061
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,240
No, I...

2062
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,300
It's confirmed that...

2063
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,780
He's not gonna be in a wheelchair.

2064
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,060
Because in the Corcoa...

2065
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,380
Corcoa map...

2066
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:22,640
Where...

2067
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:23,460
The fuck...

2068
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,520
The stupid...

2069
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,460
Mutant safe haven.

2070
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:30,220
That there's a...

2071
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,700
There's a statue of him.

2072
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,060
Of him walk...

2073
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:35,540
Like, there's a statue of him in his walking form.

2074
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,640
So like...

2075
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,860
It's confirmed that he's not gonna be on...

2076
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,100
He's not gonna be like...

2077
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:42,700
In a...

2078
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:43,660
In a wheelchair.

2079
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,360
I'm so sad.

2080
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,220
And then like...

2081
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,040
I was seeing people debate about it.

2082
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:48,480
They're like...

2083
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,640
The Marvel fans.

2084
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,700
Were like...

2085
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:51,360
Oh my God.

2086
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,380
I hate how like...

2087
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,880
People don't know that like...

2088
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:54,840
He can walk now.

2089
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:55,140
Like...

2090
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,620
You can tell who's a fake fan.

2091
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,860
For not knowing that he can walk for like...

2092
01:25:58,860 --> 01:25:59,460
Years now.

2093
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:00,840
And I was like...

2094
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,200
Because him being in a wheelchair...

2095
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,720
Is so much cooler.

2096
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:05,700
Like...

2097
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,900
You don't understand.

2098
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,440
Everybody can fucking walk.

2099
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,420
Well, not obviously.

2100
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,080
Not everybody.

2101
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:12,380
But like...

2102
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:16,220
Almost all the characters in Marvel Rivals can fucking walk.

2103
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,020
I'd wanna play a guy in a wheelchair.

2104
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,160
Rolling around.

2105
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,180
Running over people.

2106
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:21,580
Like...

2107
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:22,360
That's cool.

2108
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:28,380
I wanna play as a wheelchair guy in Marvel Rivals.

2109
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,400
And then just start fucking going...

2110
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,280
Like...

2111
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,980
Why can't I have that?

2112
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:34,800
Like...

2113
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,220
Why can't I have him do fucking wheelies?

2114
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:38,780
Like...

2115
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,440
I want him to do wheelies.

2116
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,860
Imagine the...

2117
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,980
Imagine the wheelchair skins.

2118
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:48,480
Exactly!

2119
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,360
Like...

2120
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,640
I'm just saying.

2121
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:55,760
Yeah.

2122
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,280
He's wheelchair bound.

2123
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:57,900
And like...

2124
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:58,940
Most of the...

2125
01:26:58,940 --> 01:26:59,500
Like...

2126
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,140
Non-comic adaptations.

2127
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:05,940
We could make it hover.

2128
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:06,780
For all of it.

2129
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,660
I wanted a Tokyo Drift on the wheelchair.

2130
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,960
Like, is that too much to ask for?

2131
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:14,980
Like...

2132
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,380
And then there's like...

2133
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:17,500
I can see...

2134
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,300
Can't believe people don't know that he can...

2135
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,800
Yeah, cause the design is fucking boring.

2136
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,240
Oh my god.

2137
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,080
Do you know what he looks like when he can walk?

2138
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,020
He's like some fucking nerd.

2139
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,180
Alright.

2140
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,400
Charles Xavier.

2141
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:32,360
His like walk...

2142
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:36,160
His like walking design is so fucking stupid.

2143
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:37,240
I hate it.

2144
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,040
I...

2145
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,820
His new design is so lame.

2146
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,160
Give me back the wheelchair.

2147
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:43,920
Like...

2148
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:45,400
Like...

2149
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,400
He just wears black tights.

2150
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,060
Like...

2151
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,460
It's so lame.

2152
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:52,000
Look at how lame he is.

2153
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:55,620
I wanna fucking give him a swirly and stuff him in the goddamn locker.

2154
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:56,980
Like...

2155
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,680
Alright, let me show you guys.

2156
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:03,900
Let me show you guys how fucking lame it looks.

2157
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,500
Now he's just standing.

2158
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:07,620
Alright.

2159
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,320
This is what he looks like.

2160
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,120
Look how lame he looks.

2161
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:13,920
Like, what is he wearing?

2162
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,360
He's just...

2163
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,580
He's just wearing black tights.

2164
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,360
Like, what the fuck is he...

2165
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,640
He looks like the fucking Mr. Fantastic skin.

2166
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:25,720
Like...

2167
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,500
He looks like...

2168
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,520
Yeah, he looks like the maker.

2169
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:31,260
Like, why is he buff?

2170
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,460
You've been wheelchair bound for, like, years.

2171
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,400
Why are you buff?

2172
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,500
I don't...

2173
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,480
That's not how muscles work.

2174
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:43,440
You were not moving your body enough to have that.

2175
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,680
You're old!

2176
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:55,880
What's with the helmet?

2177
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,480
No, that's him!

2178
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,420
That's actually him.

2179
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,740
It's not the maker.

2180
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,580
It's him when he...

2181
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,180
When he's...

2182
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,140
His new design.

2183
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,800
His stupid fucking new design.

2184
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,880
I hate this.

2185
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,320
Dude, like, he stepped out of Warframe.

2186
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,320
Zero, I think he was a super...

2187
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,340
It is ugly!

2188
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,440
That's like...

2189
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,160
I don't understand how, like, the Marvel fans...

2190
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:30,580
Like, the comic book Marvel fans are, like, being so pretentious about how they're like...

2191
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:33,160
Oh, um, I don't understand.

2192
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,780
Like, they're like...

2193
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:40,640
I can't believe they don't know that Charles Xavier hasn't been in a wheelchair for fucking...

2194
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,640
Cause it's boring!

2195
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,420
Like, look at this man!

2196
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,600
I wanna stuff him in a fucking locker!

2197
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,040
All the other guys, they are so iconic.

2198
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:51,720
Yes, Lay.

2199
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,040
And then there's him!

2200
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,200
Like, what the fuck am I looking at?

2201
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,440
He's so...

2202
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,140
He's so boring!

2203
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:02,440
Like, okay.

2204
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:06,660
If I google Charles Xavier, they're all in wheelchairs!

2205
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:10,000
Why play this guy?

2206
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:12,060
When I can play...

2207
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,160
When I can play this guy.

2208
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:15,980
Doing fucking wheelies.

2209
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,820
Doing a Tokyo Drift.

2210
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,600
Alright, this is...

2211
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,780
Okay, why play him when I can play him?

2212
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,780
He does the...

2213
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:32,000
Like...

2214
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,040
Imagine the possibilities!

2215
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,360
The things I can do!

2216
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,260
Oh, Dango, thank you for the super chat.

2217
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,700
Thank you, thank you.

2218
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,580
He just, he lost...

2219
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:48,900
Yeah, I know, he lost his aura.

2220
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,200
He really did.

2221
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:50,940
At least...

2222
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:53,420
Okay, if you don't want to make him look like...

2223
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:54,580
Sir Patrick Stewart.

2224
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,780
At least make him look like James McAvoy.

2225
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,100
Because at least that's hot.

2226
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,640
At least give me McAvoy.

2227
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,520
In his first class uniform.

2228
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,060
I'll take that.

2229
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,780
At least...

2230
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:10,980
At least...

2231
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:11,500
True.

2232
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,540
At least...

2233
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:16,500
At least give me James McAvoy in first class.

2234
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,420
I'll take that over the stupid ass...

2235
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:23,280
Black tighties that he has.

2236
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,700
So that's what this is about.

2237
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:33,860
Oh my god.

2238
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,320
Or just give me this.

2239
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:35,900
I don't care.

2240
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,080
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

2241
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,280
I'm not...

2242
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,300
Look, I'm not demanding much.

2243
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:41,740
Or just give me this.

2244
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,060
I'll even take the fucking hover wheelchair.

2245
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,920
Like, I'll even take this.

2246
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:47,500
Give me this.

2247
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,540
I'll take this too.

2248
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,560
Like, just put him back in the chair.

2249
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,080
No one...

2250
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:56,560
Of course no one knows about the Mr. Fucking...

2251
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,880
Fucking a nerd.

2252
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:59,500
Of course no one knows.

2253
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,880
Of course no one knows about this design.

2254
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:02,740
Like, the mainstream.

2255
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:04,580
It's so boring.

2256
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,460
It's actually...

2257
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:09,000
Why would anybody know about this design?

2258
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:11,600
It's so fucking boring.

2259
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:13,340
Like, it's just...

2260
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:14,960
Like, why is it so tight?

2261
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:15,880
Why?

2262
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,560
Like, from this...

2263
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,300
This to this.

2264
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:20,580
Like...

2265
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:24,920
Like, please.

2266
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:25,730
Someone...

2267
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:29,660
Someone find where he lives and get a crowbar.

2268
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,160
Like, I don't know.

2269
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,140
Like...

2270
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:37,440
Why does he have abs?

2271
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,260
Like...

2272
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:40,600
No, it's him.

2273
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,040
It's actually...

2274
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,560
Like, why can't he walk just now?

2275
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,140
Why...

2276
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,480
Like...

2277
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:51,100
So, like...

2278
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,640
Alright, so apparently...

2279
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,080
He dies yet again.

2280
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,540
And then he was reborn.

2281
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:57,580
So, and...

2282
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,840
He was reborn.

2283
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:03,380
And then he can walk now.

2284
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,720
Like, that's the whole thing.

2285
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,720
He dies a million times.

2286
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,500
But, you know, this is the time where he was born again.

2287
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:12,520
But this time with the ability to, like, walk.

2288
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:13,860
Yeah.

2289
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:14,840
Yeah.

2290
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:19,160
That's basically how it happens.

2291
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,100
I just...

2292
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:20,840
But yeah, so...

2293
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,280
So, most...

2294
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,780
He's not gonna be in a wheelchair and that makes me sad.

2295
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:30,640
I thought it'd be so cool to play, like, a wheelchair support character.

2296
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:33,540
Just, like, the possibilities of you just, like...

2297
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:34,980
You know, like...

2298
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:41,080
You know, like, there's an ability where you could, like, you know, run someone over in your wheelchair.

2299
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:42,360
Like...

2300
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:47,280
I thought that would be, like...

2301
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,400
I thought that would be really fun to do.

2302
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,040
It would be really funny in-game.

2303
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:52,740
That would... Yeah, exactly.

2304
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:02,000
So I get boring-ass fucking guy in a black tight suit.

2305
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,580
With, like, Mr. Van...

2306
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:08,740
Like, Mr. Fantastic-looking-ass here.

2307
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,860
Anyway, that's how I like to end my day.

2308
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,440
That's how I like to end my stream, guys.

2309
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,340
That's...

2310
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,800
This rant is how I like to end my stream.

2311
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,500
Because, um...

2312
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,800
Because I'm tired now.

2313
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,040
I'm gonna... I'm gonna head off now.

2314
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:33,540
Oh yeah, Professor...

2315
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:36,780
Instead of Professor X, we get Professor Latex.

2316
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:41,280
Anyway, guys.

2317
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,720
I'm gonna call it here.

2318
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,780
I'm gonna rest a bit.

2319
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,760
I'm gonna post...

2320
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,720
For the member goons, I'm gonna post the members...

2321
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:51,080
About what time the final Battle Royale event will be.

2322
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:53,860
Let's hope the server is still up by then.

2323
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:58,060
Because I don't know what exactly the time it's gonna shut down.

2324
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:00,820
It would be awkward if it shut down.

2325
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:02,840
Before then.

2326
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,040
But hopefully, it won't be.

2327
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:08,700
Anyway, guys.

2328
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,020
As always, everybody.

2329
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,440
Stay hydrated.

2330
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:12,360
Pause to chat.

2331
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,360
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2332
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:15,480
And if you...

2333
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,460
Stay up for me...

2334
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,840
Head to bed, cause...

2335
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,660
You deserve it.

2336
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:19,420
Hey, guys.

2337
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,420
I'll see you guys later, everybody.

2338
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,020
I don't know why I said anyway, guys.

2339
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:27,060
I got way too passionate about my rant.

2340
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:29,440
I'll see you guys later, everyone.

2341
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,480
Bye bye, everybody.

2342
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,480
I hope you guys enjoyed...

2343
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:32,800
Good Night, Dragoons.

2344
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,880
It's been a long time.

2345
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:35,540
So, I hope you guys sleep well now...

2346
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:37,260
Or have a good rest of your day.

2347
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,400
Bye bye, everyone.

2348
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,260
Bye!
