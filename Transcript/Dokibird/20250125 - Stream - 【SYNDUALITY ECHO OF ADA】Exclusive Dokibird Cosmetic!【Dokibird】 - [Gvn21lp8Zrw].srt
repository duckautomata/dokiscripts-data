00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,110
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,570
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,610
I'm so nervous.

4
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,430
There's a lot of new people.

5
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,370
Okay, so...

6
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,630
Hello, people on the official Bandai channel.

7
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,670
They're like, what the...

8
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,790
I'm trying not to swear.

9
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,970
I guess I'm on the official channel.

10
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,970
They're like, who the heck is this anime girl talking to me right now?

11
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,450
What the heck?

12
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,730
This says Dragon Ball Z 2023.

13
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,530
What is this?

14
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,570
That's not Dragon Ball.

15
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,210
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,390
I noticed the YouTube title was like, Dragon Ball Z Sparkling Zero 2023.

17
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,430
And I was like, wow!

18
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,810
They're in for some disappointment.

19
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,690
Hello, hello, hello.

20
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,650
There's gonna be a lot of new people here watching.

21
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,810
So, I'm nervous, guys.

22
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,150
I'm so nervous.

23
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,490
A lot of people are gonna...

24
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,710
So, anyway.

25
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,930
My name is Doki Bird.

26
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:37,410
I am an indie VTuber who primarily specializes in shooters, FPS, third-person, all that stuff.

27
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,350
I have high rankings.

28
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,770
I've been top 500 in Overwatch, Apex, and peak top 30 in Marvel Rivals.

29
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,150
Last season.

30
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,470
Or this season, actually.

31
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,710
Last season, I ended top 500 in Marvel Rivals.

32
00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:00,710
So, I'm here to talk to you guys about Senuality and the Echo of Ada.

33
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,930
And it just launched recently.

34
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,070
Yeah, I know.

35
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,430
The Bandai chat is very confused.

36
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,150
I know.

37
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,850
It doesn't help that it says Dragon Ball Z.

38
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,230
They're like, this isn't Dragon Ball Z.

39
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,070
Anyway.

40
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:24,070
So, I'm here to celebrate and introduce to people the launch of Senuality Echo of Ada.

41
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,970
And for those completionists out there, I'm also giving away an exclusive code from watching the stream.

42
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,650
And I believe the code is limited time.

43
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,710
And it is for all platforms.

44
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,410
Also, I have a sound guy.

45
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,530
So, sound guy, please let me know if the volume is too loud.

46
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:47,390
Because I didn't keep any records from the previous sound balancing for this game.

47
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:56,770
So, if you use my code that I'll be showing on the stream, you will unlock a special t-shirt.

48
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,910
That's just me.

49
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,970
It has my face on it.

50
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,650
But it's also really good if you're a completionist.

51
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,150
Because you don't want to have this...

52
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,310
You don't want to be missing a shirt, you know, from your whole collection.

53
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,830
But for my fans out there, of course, they would really want this shirt.

54
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:12,450
Of course.

55
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,530
Because they're like, oh my gosh, a Dookie Boo shirt on an official Bandai game.

56
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,450
And all of that.

57
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,410
And all of that.

58
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,730
So, yes.

59
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,210
So, I'll be giving away a code for you guys.

60
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,470
So, you can claim it.

61
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,170
And unlock this special shirt that you can use in-game for your waifu.

62
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,570
I think the guys can wear it too.

63
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,310
But like, we all know it's for waifus.

64
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,270
By the way, I am hyped up and a lot of caffeine right now.

65
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,270
Because I had to wake up early.

66
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,030
Okay, I'm sorry.

67
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,350
I know this is not the sponsored part of this portion.

68
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,850
But like, I had to wake up early to go get my passport today.

69
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,150
So, I am hyped up and a lot of caffeine right now.

70
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,750
Because I was so tired lining up to get my passport today.

71
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,670
Because if I don't get it today, I have to wait Monday.

72
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,370
Because of bureaucracy and shit like that.

73
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,510
It really sucks.

74
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,250
I'm Canadian.

75
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,330
And we have to line- Okay, so like, when I got my passport, I had to like, line up.

76
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,830
I had to line up to go to the passport office.

77
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,250
And I had to line up to tell them I need my passport.

78
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,430
And then after I line up to tell them I need my pas- I need to renew my passport.

79
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,550
I had to line up to give them my application for my passport.

80
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:40,250
And then after that, it was like three hours of just lining up.

81
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,510
Lining up in three different lines.

82
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,730
And then I had to pick up my passport.

83
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,730
I had to line up to tell them what I have to do.

84
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,930
Why I'm here at the passport office.

85
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,730
And then after that, they made me line up to pick up my passport.

86
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,390
And you think it would be really fast because you're just picking up your passport.

87
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,370
But no!

88
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,690
They had to go through so many- Like, it was a long line.

89
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,090
It was- It was- It was- It was a long line.

90
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,710
And it was just- I thought it'd just be like, here you go.

91
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,270
Like, here's your- the receipt.

92
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,530
And they just give you the passport.

93
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,470
But then they'd be like- I don't know what they're checking.

94
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,650
I don't know what they're checking.

95
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,970
There's so many.

96
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,310
There's so many paperwork.

97
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,030
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,030
That's a little off topic.

99
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,670
For those who are new here and were like, I thought you were gonna show us sinuality.

100
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:31,850
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,870
I just got a little distracted there.

102
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,890
I usually do, like, life updates.

103
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,290
And I know this is a sponsored stream by me.

104
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,350
That's why I'm on Bandai right now.

105
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,470
That's why I'm on the official channels.

106
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,370
By the way, I'm not employed by Bandai.

107
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,750
I am a sponsored streamer.

108
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:59,470
That they have sponsored me to come here to talk to you guys about sinuality.

109
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,010
But this is basically, like, a snippet of my streams and stuff like that.

110
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,870
So please, if you're curious, check me out on Doki Bird.

111
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,110
I'm actually streaming on YouTube right now on my own channel.

112
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,390
But I'm doing a multi-stream right now.

113
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,750
This is my very first time doing a multi-stream.

114
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,990
I was very scared.

115
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,130
Because I've never done a multi-stream.

116
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,750
And then I also have to record this stream.

117
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,250
So that it puts on a loop on the Steam.

118
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,110
It's gonna be on looped.

119
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,850
The stream is gonna be looped on Steam as well.

120
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,710
When you are on sinuality.

121
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,970
And then I'm multi-streaming on both the Bandai official channel.

122
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,190
And also the Bandai official Twitch.

123
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,050
So I was like, is my PC gonna die?

124
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,210
I was Googling it.

125
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,310
And they were like...

126
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,070
It was like, you gotta have the bandwidth.

127
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,570
And like the internet.

128
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,350
And like the PC to handle all of this.

129
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,330
And then I looked at the instructions.

130
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,210
And I was like...

131
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,530
I was like, oh man.

132
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,950
My PC is either gonna god damn explode.

133
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,770
Or everything will be okay.

134
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,430
I could have tested it on like other channels.

135
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,470
But I was like, the fun part is to do it live.

136
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,670
I could have tested this out earlier.

137
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,570
I didn't realize.

138
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,790
I forgot about the recording part too.

139
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,850
I was just like, oh man.

140
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,530
I forgot I have to record.

141
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,430
I live for the rush.

142
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,210
Especially when I get paid for it.

143
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,850
I live for the potential for it messing up.

144
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,490
But anyway.

145
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,050
So I was just like, okay.

146
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,610
Clearly, you know, I was like multi-streaming on YouTube and Twitch.

147
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,370
And my own YouTube channel.

148
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,430
It can't be that bad.

149
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,370
But then I forgot about the recording part.

150
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,770
So then I was like, oh that could be a little risky.

151
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,170
That's a little bit too much.

152
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,830
So, if I suddenly disappear.

153
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,750
I hope I'm okay.

154
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,830
I hope I'm okay if I disappear.

155
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,450
Anyway, guys.

156
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,530
Alright, so.

157
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,730
Like I said.

158
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,680
I am ready to check out Senuality.

159
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,130
Well, to be fair, we checked it.

160
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,150
This is going to be our third time checking out Senuality.

161
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,250
But it's the official launch.

162
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,930
So more Dragoons, more fans.

163
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,910
You guys can go into my lobbies.

164
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,010
And then I'm going to steal your goddamn legs.

165
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,130
But the best part is that this time.

166
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,550
You can wear my t-shirt while I steal your legs.

167
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,010
So for those who don't know.

168
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,110
Senuality Echo of Ada is an extraction shooter.

169
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,410
So if you die, you lose everything.

170
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,450
Because I'm going to kill you.

171
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,490
Sorry.

172
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,870
In-game.

173
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,850
In Senuality.

174
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,870
In Senuality.

175
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,530
Because if you die, most likely by me.

176
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,370
I'm going to steal your legs.

177
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,010
And then you lose everything.

178
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,270
And your waifu too.

179
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,330
Apparently I can kidnap your wives too.

180
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,650
So like, we've done it before.

181
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,730
Multiple times.

182
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,730
And I'm looking forward to that.

183
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,710
So don't go in thinking you're not going to lose everything.

184
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,530
Because you will.

185
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,710
And it's going to be to me.

186
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,750
Anyway.

187
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,170
To my sound guy.

188
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,550
Yes, I can see your messages.

189
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,130
I can see mostly on my own channel messages.

190
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,070
So like just put it on my channel.

191
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,010
There's a lot of chat messages going around.

192
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,930
But like, I cannot.

193
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,990
Oh my gosh.

194
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,290
I already am multi-streaming.

195
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,670
There's too many chat things everywhere.

196
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,570
So like, at best, comment.

197
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,310
My mods, please comment on my YouTube channel.

198
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,150
So I know what's going on.

199
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,870
If you don't, I will freak out.

200
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,550
Alright.

201
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,350
So yes, let me know about the sound later on.

202
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,130
If everything is okay.

203
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,450
Anyway guys, let's actually get into it.

204
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,510
This is actually my third time checking out Senuality.

205
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,270
We've checked it.

206
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,450
We're going to create our waifu for the third time.

207
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,610
I don't remember what she looked like anymore.

208
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,990
It's been a while.

209
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,270
Oh, I forgot to do the options.

210
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:19,850
God damn it.

211
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,050
Okay.

212
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,470
I forgot the options part.

213
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,230
I'm trying my best guys.

214
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,590
Alright.

215
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,090
Alright.

216
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,250
So...

217
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,590
For those...

218
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,510
Basically, it's like...

219
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,650
Mecha waifu's extraction shooter.

220
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,430
So if you know like, games...

221
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,430
Like...

222
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,770
Tarkov...

223
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,050
It's like...

224
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,670
That, but like mechas.

225
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,210
And with hotter waifus and that stuff.

226
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,850
So like, it's actually an improvement if you think about it.

227
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:54,610
Alright.

228
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,570
Not...

229
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,110
Doki.

230
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,750
How would they know?

231
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,430
If I name...

232
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,310
How is no one ever still not Doki?

233
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,230
I don't understand.

234
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,830
It's like the best name...

235
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,690
Out there.

236
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,490
Okay.

237
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,550
This is the third time I watched this intro.

238
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,730
But to be honest, I already...

239
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,590
I feel like...

240
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,090
Um...

241
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,330
I feel like I need to rewatch this again.

242
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,430
How would they know?

243
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,170
I'm totally ready.

244
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,390
You can tell I'm really hyped up and caffeine right now.

245
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,570
Not okay.

246
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,250
Alright, brought up overall sound, guys.

247
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,390
Oh my god, that's so crazy.

248
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,750
Oh my god,

249
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,470
so very cool.

250
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,390
For reasons unknown to this day, the great city of Amasia collapsed.

251
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,550
Humanity returned to the surface, but faced constant energy shortages.

252
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:15,530
As if that were not enough of a challenge, Enders, an unknown lifeform, appeared, further threatening humanity.

253
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,050
Oh my god.

254
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,530
The evil Y-Hot.

255
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,510
That's us.

256
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,770
That's gonna be us, basically.

257
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,750
We're the Drifters.

258
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,170
I'll bring up a little bit more.

259
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,130
Okay.

260
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,770
Can't wait to mine.

261
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,690
So... that's their hot android waifus.

262
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,270
Or husbandos, but like...

263
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,090
We checked the rank- the last time...

264
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,410
The last time we played this game, we checked the top 500 rankings for this game.

265
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:58,430
And there was only one player that had a guy as their companion.

266
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,650
The solo chat amongst the waifus.

267
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,570
That's where we're proud of.

268
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,170
Then we can be evil too and kill other Drifters.

269
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,730
For money.

270
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,270
And to kidnap other Drifters waifus.

271
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,530
Which is like- I mean like...

272
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,530
Being a good guy is so goddamn boring.

273
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:51,890
Like,

274
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,630
why become friends when we can just kill each other in game?

275
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,610
It makes life more exciting, you know?

276
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,830
Tokino!

277
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,630
Thank you for watching.

278
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,510
The final section of the selection exam will now begin.

279
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,330
We wish you the best of luck.

280
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,590
Please proceed to your mark in the little coffin.

281
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,250
Alright, so we are basically dropped into- the tutorial is really fast.

282
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,490
Like, I've done this tutorial like three times already.

283
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,530
This is gonna be my third time doing this tutorial.

284
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,610
Spoken like a true League- So this is our temporary waifu.

285
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,670
I like how this is my third time, but I still forget how- I still forget the instructions.

286
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,730
Alright, we gotta look at the display.

287
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,650
Clear, clear.

288
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,690
It always surprises me every time.

289
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,850
Oh my gosh.

290
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,670
Okay, I forgot.

291
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,290
I need to...

292
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,790
Motion blur off.

293
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,230
Guys, I can't fix the gra- I keep forgetting to fix the graphics settings, guys.

294
00:17:59,550 --> 00:17:59,810
Sorry.

295
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,390
The graphics for this game is so- I might be lagging a little bit.

296
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,830
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,350
Just...

298
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,570
Give me a sec.

299
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,130
We gotta finish the tutorial.

300
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,490
And then I- My waifu is way too HD right now.

301
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,850
So I need to finish the tutorial.

302
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,930
And then everything will be okay.

303
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:25,650
I can't- I can't adjust anything yet until I- Until I finish the tutorial.

304
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:32,770
So like- My waifu is just too pretty.

305
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,530
Too beautiful.

306
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,930
So that's why I look like this right now.

307
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,350
So she can look like that.

308
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,350
Don't worry.

309
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,830
I can do this really fast though.

310
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,910
Alright.

311
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,350
I'm gonna touch grass for the first time.

312
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,050
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,490
I gotta make sure you look a little uglier, waifu.

314
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,450
So I can- I can actually move.

315
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,450
I look like this.

316
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,490
So she can move like that.

317
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:14,550
But- But- Guys, the sacrifices I make for her.

318
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,710
I- She's not even my- My permanent waifu.

319
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,090
I do it for her.

320
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,350
She's not even my permanent waifu.

321
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,690
She's so little.

322
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,690
She's like my- My teacher.

323
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,470
I do it for her.

324
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,070
I do it for her.

325
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,210
AO search.

326
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,250
What was it again?

327
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,670
Uh, C.

328
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,610
Okay, AO searches.

329
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,830
C.

330
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,970
Okay, it was time to get the crystals.

331
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,630
Oh my god.

332
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,250
But at least it's so- At least it's beautiful.

333
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,170
Let's run over the dog.

334
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,810
The things I do for her.

335
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,190
Okay.

336
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,270
Alright, we gotta speedrun this.

337
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,650
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:06,170
I know you guys are like, Yoki, please read the- Guys, we gotta- We have to speedrun this so I can fix my graphics.

339
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,470
I can at least move at 30 frames.

340
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,410
Like, that's the goal.

341
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,050
Alright, and then basically- Excavate real fast.

342
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,270
Alright, let's pick this up.

343
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,730
Guys, guys, please.

344
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,110
We're almost there.

345
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,150
Like, we have like, three more- Two more sections of this tutorial.

346
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,170
Guys, we're almost there.

347
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,250
I always forget.

348
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,170
I always forget how- How many polygons my wife has.

349
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,630
Like, every time.

350
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,750
You'd think I would learn after the first- First time playing.

351
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,170
But I keep forgetting.

352
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,470
I'll be like, alright, let's just go in.

353
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,410
But then I forget- I forgot that my wife has so many polygons.

354
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,070
That like- Like, I have to look like this for a bit until I get to the settings.

355
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,430
I never learn.

356
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,630
I just never learn.

357
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,030
But I learned how to multi-stream.

358
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,990
Oh no, by the way, water hurts me.

359
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,250
For those who are new here and forgot about that.

360
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,270
Or like, being like, who the hell is this anime girl?

361
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,830
Water hurts me, just like real life.

362
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,070
I'm already having to touch grass and now I have to deal with water.

363
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,330
It's like basically acid rain.

364
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,810
Oh, the sound, guys.

365
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,110
Does the sound better now?

366
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,910
Water's my mortal enemy.

367
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,570
Yeah, the wicked witch of the west.

368
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,430
Because it forces me to- Okay, guys.

369
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,050
I actually shower, guys.

370
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:57,930
But as a gamer, I am obligated to make a- Gamers don't shower joke, but I do shower.

371
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,670
I legitimately- I shower today, guys.

372
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,430
I am not a fake gamer.

373
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,170
Just because you shower, that's- Oh, who cares about the rain?

374
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,950
Just, you know, I don't even care.

375
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,970
Oh my god, please.

376
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,590
Please, I am getting damaged by rain.

377
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,470
Can you not talk faster?

378
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,210
Okay.

379
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,750
Okay, so I remember I can do the multi-skill.

380
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,690
So each wife has like its own unique skill.

381
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,530
That like is basically for a specific playstyle.

382
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,770
So this wife basically- This wife's playstyle is a PvE playstyle.

383
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,590
Okay, and then I have to open the door.

384
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,790
How do I send it?

385
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,990
Okay, here we go.

386
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,850
Yay, the rain stopped!

387
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,530
Yippee!

388
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,170
So you guys got my mandatory shower.

389
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,250
With acid rain.

390
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,690
And then I just started blasting- Oh shit.

391
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,470
There's no fall damage, so you're fine.

392
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,890
Alright, and then we head home.

393
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,630
Don't make it weird.

394
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,490
Alright, heading home now.

395
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:34,250
Alright, so once your durability reaches zero, your unit will be destroyed and you'll lose both your- Oh, like I said, this is an extraction shooter.

396
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,970
So if you die, you lose everything unless you get insurance.

397
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,430
But I ain't no coward and I don't get insurance.

398
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:46,110
It's like when you- Oh yeah, she's- I'm on the- Doki, you're on the official Bandai channel.

399
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,450
You can't say really messed up stuff right now because you might not be able to get away with it.

400
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,050
I was gonna say, why get insurance?

401
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,350
It's better to get insurance, guys.

402
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:05,930
Especially if you live in places where, you know, hospital bills are very expensive.

403
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,590
Insurance is really good.

404
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:16,650
Anyway, so there are- Alright guys, now that I'm not lagging anymore.

405
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,630
Make sure you put your insurance on your waifus too.

406
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,410
So, there's like four different templates you can choose.

407
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,990
Nobody picks him.

408
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,050
I wonder why.

409
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,610
I'm sorry, Beta.

410
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,290
Also, they're apparently called Betas and the women are Alphas.

411
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,690
So like, you can sort of tell why no one wants to pick the Beta.

412
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,730
We're not picking the Beta male!

413
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,210
You guys are a very vocal minority.

414
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,070
I swear, last time I gave you guys a chance to vote for it.

415
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,870
And I saw a lot of Beta people asking for the Beta male character.

416
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,230
But then, when I put up the poll, the Alpha woman won.

417
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,690
Like, you guys are like so vocal, but yet there's like ten of you.

418
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:19,130
I won't be surprised if you made like twenty counts each to make yourself look like you're the majority.

419
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,810
Like, re-roll.

420
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,850
Come on, let us re-roll.

421
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:38,490
Alright, I swear, if I made the poll and gave you guys a minute to choose the character, the Alpha woman will still win.

422
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,410
The lurker majority will still outpace you.

423
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,790
Alright, alright, let's see.

424
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,070
Beta male, Alpha woman.

425
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:58,010
Who should my wife, my android waifu husbando be?

426
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,290
Alright.

427
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,170
Alright, guys.

428
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,170
I'll give you guys... For those who want to know, where are we voting?

429
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,490
Where are we voting?

430
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,650
It is usually... This is our default.

431
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,330
IBAlpha09 is our default.

432
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,530
Then a lot of...

433
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,910
The vocal... Oh, look at that!

434
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,450
The Alpha woman won with a 69% majority.

435
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,350
Look at that!

436
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,850
For those who are wondering, where are we voting?

437
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,010
We're voting on my main channel on YouTube at Toki Bird.

438
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,130
But wow!

439
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,770
What a surprise!

440
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,750
Oh wow!

441
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,890
It even went up a percentage!

442
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,070
It went up!

443
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,330
Cowards!

444
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,230
Oh my god, it keeps going up!

445
00:26:54,310 --> 00:27:02,290
I literally... And then if I scroll up and look at my chat, I see so many people that were like, Come on, let us try!

446
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,770
Reroll, coward!

447
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,190
Make the pull!

448
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,750
Pick him, you coward!

449
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,550
Rigged!

450
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,450
Pull again!

451
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:19,990
I have not seen... I've only seen one person in the sea of beta male be waifu, of course.

452
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:25,250
So I was like, if we scream loud enough, we can win!

453
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,470
No!

454
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,210
Double or... nothing!

455
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,450
Jdu, thank you for the super chat!

456
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,510
Thank you, thank you!

457
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,710
Guys messed up.

458
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,670
Beta male would be funnier because it's what streamers don't want.

459
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,950
Thank you for the super chat, Jdu!

460
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,050
Thank you, thank you!

461
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,730
Weak chat goes for not voting for beta male.

462
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,310
Mike, thank you for the super chat!

463
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,250
Thank you, thank you!

464
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,330
Wow, look at that!

465
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,850
The alpha woman has won for the third time!

466
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,510
The silent... look at that!

467
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,510
The silent majority has won yet again!

468
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,690
Remember the vote!

469
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,810
Alright.

470
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,470
Okay, so we wanna be... we wanna be...

471
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,350
God, I love women.

472
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,330
We wanna have...

473
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,130
Which one was the one that specializes on specifically PvP?

474
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,010
Because I'm here to beat up other players.

475
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,230
That's right, I'm coming for you.

476
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,950
Alright, a system specializing in anti-cradle combat.

477
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,090
I think it was this, right?

478
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,210
Okay, anti-cradle.

479
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,970
Displays cradle's health, features a magic skill that restrains any...

480
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,910
Oh, it's this one, yeah.

481
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,350
So anti-cradle is basically...

482
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,950
Also, like, who wants to be a weatherman?

483
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,930
Okay, so there's one other skill that's called weathergazer.

484
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,110
And all you do is just tell the weather.

485
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,410
I'm sorry, but that is such a useless waifu skill.

486
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,050
You're literally like a news reporter.

487
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,510
I've killed many weathergazer because I know they don't know what to do.

488
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:01,970
So...

489
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:13,670
So if you are a weatherman or a reporter, I will hunt you down.

490
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,190
Because I know you have nothing.

491
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,070
I ended the weatherman.

492
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,990
Alright, so there's cradle support.

493
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,630
This one is mostly like, it heals you more.

494
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,570
And this one is like for PvE, anti-enders.

495
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:31,750
This one is PvP, and then defensive, I believe, is just...

496
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:36,030
I just focus on defensive in general.

497
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,710
Alright, here we go.

498
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,070
Alright, let's...

499
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,410
I wanted to make myself, right?

500
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,730
I don't remember how I made myself last time.

501
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,990
Oh yeah, it was this.

502
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,610
It was retro doki.

503
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,530
They don't have classic doki.

504
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,150
They don't have, like, current doki.

505
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,930
So, like, let's make retro doki.

506
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,690
Oh, but then... No, wait, I can be dead mom doki.

507
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,610
Oh my god, I should be dead mom doki.

508
00:29:59,730 --> 00:29:59,970
Okay.

509
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,710
Alright, give me a sec.

510
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,410
I'm gonna make...

511
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,490
I'm gonna make dead mom doki.

512
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,330
Alright, let's see.

513
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,010
Honestly, everything else is perfect at that point.

514
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,570
I just really needed the different hair.

515
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,930
Alright, and then...

516
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,310
Let's see.

517
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,970
Yeah, very accurate.

518
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,390
There you go.

519
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,350
Just a little...

520
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,290
Just very, very accurate.

521
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,340
Oh yeah, the eye color.

522
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,540
I almost forgot my eyes.

523
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,960
Eye color.

524
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,520
I need to look at my own eyes.

525
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,120
Because sometimes I don't pay attention to what my eyes are.

526
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,120
Eye color.

527
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,260
There you go.

528
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:46,940
There you go.

529
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,740
This is me in the future.

530
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,260
Because I'll be... Oh, I'm sorry.

531
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,320
End game.

532
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,220
End game.

533
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,160
End game.

534
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,020
Okay, alright.

535
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,420
I think everything is...

536
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:03,820
Alright.

537
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,300
Alright, anyway.

538
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,560
Complete.

539
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,480
Yes.

540
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,840
Real...

541
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,600
Doki.

542
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,520
Alright.

543
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,840
Request accepted.

544
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,820
By the way, I'm sponsored by Bandai.

545
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,820
This is gonna be looped on the Steam page.

546
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,860
If you see this on Steam...

547
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,620
That means the stream got approved.

548
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,940
Oh yeah, my own house again.

549
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,520
We're counting on you to mine precious AO crystals.

550
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,960
Hey, nice.

551
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,080
Can't wait for my...

552
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,600
Waifu to not actually clean my base...

553
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,500
For the third time.

554
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,180
This is my welcome to my gamer crib.

555
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,720
There are a lot of jokes I really wanna make.

556
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,840
But then I have to remember I am on the official channel.

557
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,140
The things that are getting through...

558
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,940
It's been rough.

559
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,600
Yes, I live like this.

560
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,500
I'm a gamer.

561
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,240
You think gamers with millions...

562
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,080
I don't have millions of dollars, by the way.

563
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,500
Guys, I don't have millions of dollars.

564
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,380
But you guys all know...

565
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,860
Gamers with millions of dollars...

566
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,820
Also still live like this.

567
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,900
All we need is...

568
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,960
Legitimately, all we need...

569
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,740
Is a PC...

570
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,000
And a fridge to put all our...

571
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,740
All our ready-made...

572
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,920
Actually, who am I lying?

573
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,600
A lot of gamers just Uber Eats.

574
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,120
What are you doing?

575
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,820
Okay, she's just...

576
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,880
She's just cleaning, as always.

577
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,380
Oh, I have school uniforms?

578
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,460
Oh my god!

579
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,480
Alright, guys!

580
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,900
I think...

581
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,240
Wait, I can get a new waifu already?

582
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,820
Let's alter the existing...

583
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,100
Okay.

584
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,540
Okay, so...

585
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,560
Now, it's time...

586
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,500
To...

587
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,600
Okay, I hope I'm doing this correctly.

588
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,740
Okay, before we do that...

589
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,880
Let me fix my graphics settings real fast.

590
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,940
Let me...

591
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,680
Okay, low...

592
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,600
2x...

593
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,540
I'm sorry, waifu.

594
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,560
But like...

595
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,960
I love how you look...

596
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,880
But like, I'm struggling right now.

597
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,300
I'm struggling at the moment.

598
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,560
Alright, let's see.

599
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,840
Alright, so...

600
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,780
Let me get the code out.

601
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,320
So, like I said...

602
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,320
There is an exclusive...

603
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,660
Doki Bird t-shirt...

604
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,440
That you can claim...

605
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,120
In-game, right now!

606
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,480
Let me grab the code real quick for all of you guys.

607
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,480
And I'm gonna pin it...

608
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,160
I'm gonna pin it on the channel...

609
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,120
On the...

610
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,320
In the YouTube chat, and I'll put it on the screen too.

611
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,640
For those who are on the other channels.

612
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,680
I think I believe...

613
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,320
Actually, I don't know.

614
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,040
I don't know if there's mods that can like...

615
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,400
Put the code on the other channels.

616
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,600
I'm multi-streaming right now.

617
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,980
But let me grab the code real quick.

618
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,220
And then I'll show you how to do it.

619
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,300
So, basically all you have to do...

620
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,440
Is you go to...

621
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,120
Options.

622
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,540
You have to be in the base first.

623
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,220
You gotta be in base.

624
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,780
I found out that you can't do it...

625
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,160
When you boot up the game for the first time.

626
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,160
So you go to other.

627
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,580
And then you enter...

628
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,600
Serial code entry, right here.

629
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,120
And then, I just...

630
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,800
Okay, let me see if I copied and pasted the right thing.

631
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,160
It'd be so weird if I had like something else that I copied and pasted.

632
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,820
And then, this is literally the code.

633
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,640
You click confirm.

634
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,680
And then, Doki Bird...

635
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,940
Okay, wait.

636
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,440
Oh my god.

637
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,660
Wait.

638
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,140
I just realized I have...

639
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,360
Sorry.

640
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,420
I covered it.

641
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,080
Look at that.

642
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,160
Doki Bird t-shirt and a Bandai game.

643
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,180
That's me.

644
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,800
You guys wanna know who Doki Bird is?

645
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,440
That's me.

646
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,220
Alright.

647
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,080
Anyway, so like I said.

648
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,120
You go to other, serial code entry.

649
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,040
You click here.

650
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,520
You just copy and paste and then confirm.

651
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,800
That's basically it.

652
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,080
It's so easy.

653
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,800
Also, do not enter the incorrect code 10 times.

654
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,380
Or you'll get an error.

655
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,520
You can claim this on any platform.

656
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,240
You buy...

657
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,320
You buy Senuality Echo Veda.

658
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,780
So you buy it on Playstation.

659
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,540
You buy it on the PC.

660
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,640
It can be on any platform.

661
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,200
Let me pin it real...

662
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,360
See, I'm not scamming you guys.

663
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,500
Hahaha.

664
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,020
Go to claim Doki Bird t-shirt.

665
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,280
Alright.

666
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,440
Let me pin this real quick now.

667
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,040
Uh...

668
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,160
And then let me put it on...

669
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,720
Alright.

670
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,780
There you go.

671
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,200
Code for shirt.

672
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,680
Alright.

673
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,400
Oh my god, it's a little too big.

674
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,780
Here you guys go.

675
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,340
For those who are...

676
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,220
On the other platform.

677
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,180
Yes, it is time limited.

678
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,840
I don't know when it ends.

679
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,580
So like, that's a surprise.

680
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,040
I'm asking right now.

681
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,100
When does the code end?

682
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,340
That's the best part.

683
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,140
It's a surprise.

684
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,460
You don't know when it's gonna end.

685
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,680
That's a very good question.

686
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,260
Let me ask real quick to the...

687
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,140
To the Bandai staff.

688
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,840
It means that like...

689
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,620
You will have the shirt forever.

690
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,640
But...

691
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,900
Claiming it is time limited.

692
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,960
So the shirt is gonna be in your account forever.

693
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,300
It's just that...

694
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,700
I don't remember when it ends.

695
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,760
When it comes to like claiming the code.

696
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,760
So like...

697
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,360
That's the issue right now.

698
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,800
Other than that...

699
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,280
Wow!

700
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,960
I'm officially in the game, everybody.

701
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,060
Technically.

702
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,860
Alright, let's see if there's anything else I can do to fix this up.

703
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,800
Alright, so...

704
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,840
Now, you can see...

705
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,800
We can give my waifu...

706
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,160
Some shirts.

707
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,000
So, where's my shirt?

708
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,960
Oh my god, that's so cute though.

709
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,780
Okay, I believe...

710
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,480
I think the code is so ugly.

711
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,440
Oh my god, wait, that's so cute.

712
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,060
Wait, oh my god, wait, that's so cute.

713
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,580
Okay, no, you gotta...

714
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,920
You're sponsored, you gotta put your...

715
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
You gotta put your shirt.

716
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,880
Where's my shirt?

717
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,120
Wait, where is my shirt?

718
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,740
Give me a sec, I need to find my shirt real quick, guys.

719
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,900
Okay, tops...

720
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,480
Eyeglasses, hat...

721
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,660
Wait, I get to have tails?

722
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,700
Wait, I get to have a tail?

723
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,260
Oh my god, wait, that's so cute.

724
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,960
Wait, guys, I'm sorry.

725
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,620
I should... I need to put on my own clothes.

726
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,520
Wait, where's my shirt though?

727
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,920
Wait, oh, drifter pass.

728
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,260
Oh, there's a battle pass?

729
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,280
Wait.

730
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,120
Once you reach the highest, you'll be granted an EX rank.

731
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,160
When you gain EXP, whenever you gain a certain amount...

732
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,380
You can receive EXP rank rewards.

733
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:47,800
Okay.

734
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,980
Wait, what does the...

735
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,700
Oh, you can like, claim like...

736
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,640
Cuter wives.

737
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,380
That would never replace me.

738
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,440
That would never replace my OG waifu.

739
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
She's here forever.

740
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,860
Wait, did I not fully claim it?

741
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,620
Oh my gosh, guys, I'm a professional.

742
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,080
Okay, let me try this again.

743
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,120
No, I did!

744
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,220
Wait, where did it go?

745
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,200
Oh, I have to go to the top, sorry.

746
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,300
Afterwards, you go... Guys, I'm a professional.

747
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,320
But after you claim the code, and you're like...

748
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,480
Where's the code?

749
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,900
Yeah, return back to the title screen.

750
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,280
I knew that.

751
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,300
I...

752
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,460
Guys...

753
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,040
I knew that, guys.

754
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,560
Of course I do.

755
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,380
It's a sponsored stream.

756
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,540
I'm so prepared.

757
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,140
It was funny...

758
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,540
The staff before I started the stream...

759
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,300
Was like...

760
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,360
Oh yeah, remember...

761
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,480
Remember to claim it.

762
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,340
Go back to the start to claim it.

763
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,600
Oh my god, there it is!

764
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,800
I was like, I got you.

765
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,860
Alright, so there it is!

766
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,560
There's my shirt!

767
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,800
Oh my god, there it...

768
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,560
Okay, I need to...

769
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,620
Alright, I just want to make sure she has...

770
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,500
No pants here.

771
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,940
Actually, I don't know.

772
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,340
Okay, the white shoes is pretty cute.

773
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,240
Oh, the yellow shoes matches, I feel like.

774
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,500
And then... Wait, do I have glasses?

775
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,960
Oh my god, I can just be blind.

776
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,920
I'm sorry.

777
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,200
If you see the hair, it's like this right now.

778
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,100
The hair looks a lot better.

779
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,700
It's just that like...

780
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,380
Me and my wife have to make sacrifices for each other.

781
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,400
Okay, like...

782
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,080
I'm sorry.

783
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,420
I'm streaming right now.

784
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,860
So like, I'm sorry that you have to look like this for a little bit.

785
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,720
Just for a little bit.

786
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,760
Just for a little bit.

787
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,000
Okay, and then...

788
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,380
No, actually...

789
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,520
Yeah, this is perfect.

790
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,900
Oh, okay.

791
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,640
Let's see.

792
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,880
No, I think this is perfect.

793
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,480
The IV extra bodice suit looks so nice on her.

794
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,680
But yes, there's my t-shirt.

795
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,980
Okay, just for the sake of the fact that like...

796
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,880
You know, I gotta make sure it looks really nice.

797
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,040
Give me a sec.

798
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,080
I realize like...

799
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,260
It should be better if I actually...

800
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,800
Alright, just for everybody to look at how beautiful my wife is.

801
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,020
Let me put it on high real quick.

802
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,960
Alright, there we go.

803
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,440
There we go.

804
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,340
Look at her.

805
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,720
She's beautiful.

806
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,260
There we go.

807
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,620
There we go.

808
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,840
And that's how you claim my shirt.

809
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,060
Right here.

810
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,940
That's how you claim it.

811
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,240
Let me just...

812
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,920
Now I need to put her at like 10 polygons.

813
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,120
Let me just...

814
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,620
Let me put her back at 10 polygons real quick.

815
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,100
Alright, anyway.

816
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,640
So yeah, that's my beautiful wife.

817
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,380
With my beautiful shirt.

818
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,240
Buy my merch.

819
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,340
I don't have this as merch, but buy my other merch.

820
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,460
Oh, and also I can make her do settings too.

821
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,700
Alright, so okay.

822
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,000
So like, this is my favorite part.

823
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,800
About...

824
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,660
This is my favorite part.

825
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,420
About...

826
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,240
The stuff you can do.

827
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,940
In Extraction Shooter.

828
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,020
It's the fact that like...

829
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,880
You can emote to other actual players.

830
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,100
And...

831
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,860
The thing is...

832
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,980
Other players in this game...

833
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,240
Try to be friendly.

834
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,660
And then...

835
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,520
You can try to be friendly too.

836
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,060
But like...

837
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,520
It doesn't mean you're genuine.

838
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,240
like, when...

839
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,380
HAHAHAHAHA!

840
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,020
It doesn't mean...

841
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,520
You have to mean it.

842
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,200
haha

843
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,080
And that's the best part.

844
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,880
So here are the request that you have to do.

845
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,580
These are like mini missions when you start out.

846
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,860
So the whole thing is...

847
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,740
You have to upgrade your base and like...

848
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,120
Make it a better and better base and get more resources to improve your base and everything.

849
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,140
So I said...

850
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:12,080
This is where you basically get your like missions and stuff So basically I have to bring back some AO crystals and then this is like the top 500 the ranking so you can tell a lot about the people by like how Hot, okay.

851
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,100
Sorry, not hot.

852
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:27,620
You can tell a lot about the people in this game by what they're what they're Waifus look like so you can tell exactly like, you know They're in their soul by

853
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:55,260
How they make their Android waifu So this guy went default this guy doesn't care this guy actually is there to just play the game Nora Everyone else is like customizing their Android but like Nora over here is actually just here to game He just went default and was like it's perfect That's a gamer right there Look at that.

854
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,180
Now, let's see when we hit like...

855
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,700
Now, this is where we realized that like...

856
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,820
No one had no... Okay.

857
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,080
We already are at like 54, but we have yet to see a husbando.

858
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,420
That's all I'm gonna say.

859
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:19,200
We have yet to see a beta male and we are at 58 right now.

860
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,360
And at that point, that's when I knew that the beta male...

861
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,220
The beta male lovers are a very vocal minority.

862
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,960
Not the beta male.

863
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,780
I'm sure there's... I don't know.

864
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,020
We are at 65 right now.

865
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,920
He's out for blood.

866
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,440
Apparently, the last time we found... Okay.

867
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:53,340
The one... The one time we found like a beta male enjoyer is like within the um...

868
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,820
It's within the bounty hunter category.

869
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,640
So like... I believe it's this one, right?

870
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,640
Is it this one?

871
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,360
Loser boy?

872
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:01,940
Oh, yeah.

873
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,700
This is like... This is basically the people who are here to kill.

874
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,600
So like...

875
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,140
Um, all these people are evil... are evil people.

876
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,340
So...

877
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,580
These are the murderers in this world.

878
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,880
I like how there's some guy Harmo at Twitch.

879
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,600
So these are the murderers.

880
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,980
Uh, but like I said...

881
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,220
I have yet to see a beta male.

882
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,820
Oh, there it is!

883
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,420
Number seven!

884
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:27,620
All right.

885
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,320
I like how his name is Jarvis.

886
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,640
He named him Jarvis!

887
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,160
He named as a beta male Jarvis!

888
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,100
Of course, of course he did.

889
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,460
Jarvis clipped that.

890
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,340
Jarvis was this anime girl in my... in my anime game.

891
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,040
All right, that was our... the only time we saw a beta male.

892
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:07,480
Oh, yeah, I forgot to do the audio 65... the 65 sound effects.

893
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,620
All right.

894
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,480
Thank you, Yoshio.

895
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,360
I really appreciate the educational video.

896
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,600
I love these animations.

897
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,460
I think these animations are really cute.

898
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,420
It reminds me of like...

899
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,720
Uh, I don't know.

900
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,900
It's just really cute in general.

901
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,020
Nice stroll on the surface.

902
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,840
Take note of where materials can be found.

903
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,360
And keep your eyes out for the ever-important A.O.

904
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:41,780
crystals.

905
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,600
Collect those A.O.

906
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,700
crystals because you can exchange them for cash.

907
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,540
I love the little mech legs.

908
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,120
Me too.

909
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,560
That's why it inspires me to...

910
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,660
To just be like just there to steal the legs.

911
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,180
That's literally my inspiration right now.

912
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,950
All right, anyway, so...

913
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,050
Thank you, wife, for washing my dishes.

914
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,450
Um, let me increase the sound effects volume.

915
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,610
Real quick and then that should be good.

916
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,190
And then, uh...

917
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:23,570
Swordy prep.

918
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,570
So this is where you prep for your mission.

919
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,730
If you're lazy like me...

920
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,350
Guess you automate it.

921
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:37,770
Because I don't want to bring... Oh, I could bring in my own legs, but I feel like I said so much shit.

922
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:41,210
I feel like somebody's gonna try and rob, you know...

923
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,410
Okay, I'll get... I can get insurance.

924
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,410
I believe.

925
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,190
Okay.

926
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,470
All right, I believe.

927
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,070
Okay, I'll just bring in... I'll just bring in...

928
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:53,150
I'll just bring in DLC legs.

929
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,970
I feel like I'm gonna get robbed, but like I believe.

930
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,290
Okay, so you can lose items.

931
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,010
But if you don't want to lose items, obviously you can insurance them.

932
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,950
So like right now, I'm...

933
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,150
I need... Okay, how much money do I have?

934
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:12,830
Okay.

935
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,470
Apparently, I'm broke.

936
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,150
So this is a little awkward.

937
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:18,830
So I'm risking it all right now.

938
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:20,970
Um, I'm...

939
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,070
I'm risking it all right now, hoping that I won't get robbed.

940
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,050
I like how someone's like, you don't need insurance, you live in Canada.

941
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:38,830
All right, let's hope that I get to keep my DLC legs.

942
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,290
Get her, she has the DLC!

943
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,310
That's right, you can't get me if I'm faster though.

944
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:51,610
All right.

945
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:54,870
So...

946
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,870
Like I said, this is an extraction shooter.

947
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,730
So it's all about trying to get loot and...

948
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,810
And kill the other players and everything.

949
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:02,810
Um...

950
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,690
No, I'm pretty sure I have heals, right?

951
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:05,990
Did I pack heals?

952
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,490
No, I'm pretty sure I did.

953
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,710
There's no way I didn't.

954
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:09,790
There's no way.

955
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:13,390
There's no way I forgot one of the most important things.

956
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:14,810
Heals and ammo.

957
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,070
I pressed automated replacements.

958
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,910
There's no way I didn't get ammo.

959
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,830
I pressed M.

960
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,530
There's no way.

961
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,570
I didn't get any ammo.

962
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,370
Oh my god, I...

963
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,750
Oh my god, what happened to my inventory?

964
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,590
Okay, let's head home.

965
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,110
We're gonna head home straight away.

966
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,590
We're heading home.

967
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,470
I'm gonna head home.

968
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,110
This is very dangerous.

969
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:51,170
I'm a little scared.

970
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:51,970
Oh my god.

971
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,090
Okay.

972
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,390
All right, I'm gonna try and head home.

973
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:56,590
Really?

974
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,470
Oh my god.

975
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:01,550
Oh no.

976
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,010
All right, don't worry.

977
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,170
We're gonna... our main mission is to survive right now.

978
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,370
There's no...

979
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,190
Our main mission right now is to survive.

980
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,290
There's no way.

981
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:12,630
Oh no.

982
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:14,530
There's no way.

983
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,810
They don't know who I am.

984
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,070
Okay.

985
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:17,870
All right, guys.

986
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,950
This is looking a little rough right now.

987
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,930
I don't remember if... there is fall damage, by the way.

988
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:22,770
Guys, guys, there is...

989
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:26,450
From what I remember, there is absolutely is fall damage.

990
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,050
Okay, I don't hear anybody.

991
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,130
We're very safe.

992
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:33,630
Okay.

993
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,150
We're very safe.

994
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,050
We gotta be careful.

995
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,470
We have zero bullets.

996
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:40,390
Oh no.

997
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,270
Oh no.

998
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:41,950
I'm gonna jump.

999
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:42,990
Oh no.

1000
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:43,410
Okay.

1001
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:44,730
Okay, it's okay.

1002
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:45,910
Everything is fine.

1003
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,110
Wait, what?

1004
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,070
Okay.

1005
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:51,530
Okay, that's okay.

1006
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,190
They don't know I'm here.

1007
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,430
All right, that's... that's the... that's how to get out of here.

1008
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:57,030
All right.

1009
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:58,510
That's a gazing.

1010
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,870
They fire long-range attacks from above.

1011
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,670
Watch for signs of incoming attacks.

1012
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:04,890
That's the... okay.

1013
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:05,750
It's fine.

1014
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,010
The mission right now is to survive because I forgot to bring bullets.

1015
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,470
I forgot to bring any bullets.

1016
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:13,690
It's okay.

1017
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,910
We should be fine.

1018
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,870
I hear zero gunshots around me.

1019
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,170
We should be okay.

1020
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,310
There are zero gunshots around me.

1021
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,590
We'll just ride around.

1022
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,070
We'll just...

1023
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:32,790
All right.

1024
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:35,770
Okay, there we go.

1025
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:37,670
Okay.

1026
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:38,650
All right.

1027
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:39,290
Oh no.

1028
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:41,890
Oh no.

1029
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:43,430
No.

1030
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:45,130
No, there's an engine near me.

1031
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,330
Oh no, there's an engine near me.

1032
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:47,550
Please.

1033
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,650
There's an engine near me.

1034
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:51,570
Oh my god.

1035
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:51,990
Please.

1036
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,850
I don't want people to find me.

1037
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:54,790
Please.

1038
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:56,530
Please.

1039
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:00,010
I don't have... you can't... you can't... you can't kill me.

1040
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:00,810
I have nothing.

1041
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,970
Oh, it's okay.

1042
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:04,810
We're surviving.

1043
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,670
We're... we have zero bullets.

1044
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:07,750
We have zero ammo.

1045
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,270
I... I forgot to bring it.

1046
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,290
The one thing I forgot.

1047
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,190
Oh my god.

1048
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:13,930
Oh my god.

1049
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,390
We're okay.

1050
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,510
We're okay.

1051
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:16,190
All right.

1052
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,790
So like, please disregard this first mission.

1053
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:21,450
I forgot to bring the most important thing in this game.

1054
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,570
I forgot which is ammo.

1055
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,390
I...

1056
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:28,890
I forgot... oh, there's gunfire near me.

1057
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,210
Oh my god.

1058
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:32,890
There's gunfire near me.

1059
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,230
Oh no, they don't know.

1060
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,570
Okay, we're safe.

1061
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:37,050
All right.

1062
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,730
Nice mission success, guys.

1063
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,850
We did it.

1064
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,830
Look at that, guys.

1065
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,690
And that's how you do a mission, everybody.

1066
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:53,730
That's... we might not have accomplished much, but I survived and I still have my legs.

1067
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,910
All right, so every map... game you get to see like...

1068
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:05,010
Like, you know, what happened basically in the background.

1069
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,170
So like, there's nobody around me.

1070
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,610
Thank god at that point.

1071
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,810
I don't think they're...

1072
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,090
Successfully... no, no, no.

1073
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:13,970
Not a coward.

1074
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,330
I had zero ammo.

1075
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,110
I was basically unarmed.

1076
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,470
You don't shoot an unarmed man.

1077
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,250
Is there like actual people next to me?

1078
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,190
I can't tell.

1079
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,930
Did anyone else realize where I am?

1080
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,930
Okay, I think we can fast forward.

1081
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,690
I'm actually curious.

1082
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,330
Did anyone actually know where I am?

1083
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:37,770
Oh, no.

1084
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,170
Oh, look at that.

1085
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:39,690
Look at that.

1086
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:40,410
Never punished.

1087
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,950
There was nobody near me.

1088
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:45,850
There's no... I would never.

1089
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:48,090
I would never shoot an unarmed mech, guys.

1090
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:50,270
I would never do such a thing.

1091
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,850
I got materials too.

1092
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,250
I didn't complete my mission.

1093
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:56,370
Wait, no, I did.

1094
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:56,950
I got a daily.

1095
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:57,630
Okay.

1096
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:58,770
Okay, now...

1097
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,930
Okay, let me teach you how to actually play this.

1098
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:04,290
Look, I was trying to show you guys how to not play this game.

1099
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:12,750
So, like, the basic first rookie mistake playing a Sinuality Echo of Ada is, you know, you forget to...

1100
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:14,070
See?

1101
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:16,070
My wife thought I did amazing.

1102
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:20,890
She thought I did amazing.

1103
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:26,070
So I was just teaching you guys how to not play the game.

1104
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:34,270
And now I'm gonna teach you guys how to actually play Sinuality to make this game so much easier for all of you.

1105
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,450
To make some critical repairs.

1106
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:39,890
So, yeah, I live like this basically and she doesn't like that I live like this.

1107
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:43,790
So because I had... you just press this and then now you have everything.

1108
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,570
I have no idea how I forgot how this could have happened.

1109
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,670
But now I... okay, I should bring more than... more than the one.

1110
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,970
I don't know why it gave me one.

1111
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:53,970
All right, so...

1112
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:59,330
Now I have my repair kit and I'm ready for real this time.

1113
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,810
Can I... okay, I still don't have enough money to...

1114
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:04,310
To do insurance, but that's okay.

1115
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,970
I have ammo now, so I'm not scared.

1116
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,370
I am not scared this time because I have...

1117
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,610
I have ammo, so I'm not afraid.

1118
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,290
I don't need insurance.

1119
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:24,590
I don't need insurance.

1120
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,050
I have DLC legs.

1121
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,290
Currently no deaths.

1122
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,770
All right, now let me show you how to actually play this game.

1123
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,290
I know that shirt is so cute.

1124
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:35,910
It's actually really cute.

1125
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,610
It's cute because it's me.

1126
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:38,610
All right.

1127
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:39,110
Okay, now...

1128
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,130
Now that there's nice weather.

1129
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:43,470
Okay, where's the closest?

1130
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,290
Oh my god.

1131
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:45,410
It's like on the other side.

1132
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,390
Okay, we gotta go this way.

1133
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,170
So it's on the other side, so let me just...

1134
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:57,110
We need to get crystals, so I believe I have to...

1135
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,790
Where is it?

1136
00:55:59,210 --> 00:55:59,730
Wait, what?

1137
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,450
Where is the AO crystals?

1138
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,590
Oh, oh it's right here.

1139
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:06,670
It's next to me.

1140
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,030
All right, time to farm.

1141
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,490
Time to farm.

1142
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:19,190
It would be a shame if something happens to the person that tries to kill me.

1143
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,390
Okay, I feel like I can find a lot of crystals just by heading there though.

1144
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,770
I feel like...

1145
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,750
There's no way like I...

1146
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:32,230
I feel like I'm gonna bump into like so many other... so many crystals.

1147
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,770
So I don't have to like actively look for them.

1148
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,910
I keep trying to use my emotes.

1149
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:37,650
All right.

1150
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,370
Hello, anybody here?

1151
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:43,150
Any friendly mechs like me?

1152
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,650
Who is also incredibly friendly?

1153
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,230
Anybody here?

1154
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,690
Oh, I forgot to get my shotgun!

1155
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:52,990
Okay, the shotgun is so much better.

1156
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,450
I forgot to equip the shotgun.

1157
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:59,230
I think the shotgun has to be the best weapon in this game.

1158
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,490
Oh shit, not the... no, no, no, no, no, no.

1159
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,270
Okay, let me get rid of him.

1160
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:07,670
I don't- I don't like this.

1161
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,130
Okay, let's get rid of these guys.

1162
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,490
Why are you still here?

1163
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,690
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1164
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:16,670
Oh god, okay.

1165
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,270
How is he so strong?

1166
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,390
Perform repairs in a safe area.

1167
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:24,550
Oh, no.

1168
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,050
Oh, no.

1169
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:25,590
Oh, no.

1170
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:26,210
Oh, no.

1171
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,490
I cannot lose my DLC legs on this!

1172
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,870
Okay, I didn't realize how strong they are.

1173
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,050
I didn't realize how strong they are.

1174
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,970
Oh my god.

1175
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,150
Oh, no.

1176
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:36,930
Oh, no.

1177
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:38,630
Are they still chasing me?

1178
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,210
In a safe area.

1179
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:41,470
Oh my god.

1180
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,050
How do I repair?

1181
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:42,810
How do I repair?

1182
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,770
I don't remember how to repair.

1183
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:45,070
Oh, I'm freaking out.

1184
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:45,670
Oh, it's H.

1185
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:46,150
It's H.

1186
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:48,430
Durability has been reduced.

1187
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,170
You should conduct repairs now.

1188
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:50,850
I'm still okay.

1189
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:51,750
I'm- I'm so healthy.

1190
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,090
I'm so healthy.

1191
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:54,510
It's all right.

1192
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,530
I'm not freaking out.

1193
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,230
I'm not- guys, guys.

1194
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,610
I'm not freaking out, guys.

1195
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:00,450
I'm not.

1196
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:02,830
Durability is partially back on the map.

1197
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:06,550
I need to protect the leg.

1198
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,190
Guys, I didn't realize they're that strong.

1199
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,370
It's been so long!

1200
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:16,050
It's been so long since I tried to kill a regular freak.

1201
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:17,350
Okay.

1202
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,090
Nah, guys.

1203
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,630
I'm not- I- I was panicking, okay?

1204
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,210
I was just panicking.

1205
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:24,850
Um, I swear to god, it was a lot better before.

1206
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:25,970
Oh my god.

1207
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,010
Now, it's raining?

1208
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,590
What is this?

1209
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:32,830
Oh, no.

1210
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,410
Where's the goddamn cover?

1211
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:39,250
I'm trying to find a shelter.

1212
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:40,430
It's all right.

1213
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,610
A little rain doesn't hurt.

1214
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,290
I'm on a terrible- are you serious?

1215
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,090
Are you serious?

1216
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,390
Oh my god, why are they so strong?

1217
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,250
I'm just a baby!

1218
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,010
I don't understand.

1219
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,690
Why are they so strong?

1220
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:57,450
I'm feeling just a child!

1221
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,970
All right, everything is fine.

1222
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,950
Okay, let's just...

1223
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,570
Let's just get to cover.

1224
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:07,950
Wait, is this- did it stop raining?

1225
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:09,910
Okay, it stopped raining.

1226
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:11,250
All right.

1227
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:11,610
See?

1228
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,070
Oh, it did not stop raining.

1229
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:15,390
Is this covering me?

1230
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,230
Oh my god.

1231
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:21,570
Does this cover me?

1232
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:22,510
Okay, there we go.

1233
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:23,930
I'm safe now.

1234
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,050
So, I gotta wait here because outside is scary.

1235
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,950
They know my sins.

1236
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,350
When did these guys get so strong?

1237
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:40,450
I- they used to die so fast and now they take up like 80% of my health.

1238
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:45,130
Who gave these monsters like performance enhancing...

1239
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:45,910
pills?

1240
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,550
Oh no, does he know I'm here?

1241
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,490
Does he know I'm here?

1242
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,290
He doesn't know I'm here.

1243
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:55,910
He's just chilling.

1244
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,530
The rain empowers me.

1245
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,450
I'm so happy right now.

1246
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,930
All right, nice.

1247
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:03,390
Okay, wait.

1248
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:04,290
Is this next to me?

1249
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:05,710
Okay, I'm gonna go to this area.

1250
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,250
I haven't found like a single...

1251
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,710
Wait, it rained again?

1252
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,510
Oh my god, what is wrong?

1253
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,050
What did global warming do?

1254
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:17,830
Oh, I'm sorry.

1255
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,070
Oh no.

1256
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:26,410
But showering too much is actually really bad for you.

1257
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,350
Okay, so we have an escape route here.

1258
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,270
But like I don't see anybody around me.

1259
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:36,810
Where are the people?

1260
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,090
Where are the people?

1261
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:47,770
If only, if only Doki could predict the weather.

1262
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:52,230
We don't need to be we- being a weatherman.

1263
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,850
Being a weatherman is a goddamn scam.

1264
01:00:56,110 --> 01:01:00,370
I'm trying to see if I could find- there has to be somebody that's also wants to escape, right?

1265
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:02,690
Are there any friends?

1266
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,070
Any friends here?

1267
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:09,290
Come on, anybody wanna become friends with me?

1268
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,210
Come on.

1269
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,370
Look at this like...

1270
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,610
Entrance way right here.

1271
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:21,910
It's looking at so inviting and everything.

1272
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:25,970
Does anyone want to be my friend?

1273
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:28,830
There has to be somebody here.

1274
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,070
Do not trust her.

1275
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:32,430
What do you mean?

1276
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:38,390
I'm such a kind robot, kind mech here to help out all the other mechs.

1277
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:44,970
Come on, anybody wanna become a friend?

1278
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,210
What is that?

1279
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:47,770
Hello?

1280
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,350
Anybody here?

1281
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:55,050
Kind, what for- I- you don't know that.

1282
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,390
You don't know if I'm anti-creative.

1283
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,970
Sorry, that's my friendship thing.

1284
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:06,930
It's for friendship only.

1285
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:09,950
See?

1286
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,850
Slowly go down with friendship.

1287
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:16,670
Where are the friends?

1288
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,410
Also, I need to buy- I need more health.

1289
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,690
I accidentally- I actually messed up.

1290
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,130
Go back.

1291
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:26,250
I need to go back.

1292
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:27,930
My friendship circle, exactly.

1293
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:30,430
It's my friendship circle.

1294
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,590
I actually messed up with the- with the mobs.

1295
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:34,110
Assault.

1296
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:43,310
All right, anyway, mission number two is another example of how not to play this game.

1297
01:02:48,790 --> 01:03:01,970
Look, I- I purposely let the mobs hit me to show you guys just how strong the mobs are if you don't pay attention.

1298
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:13,370
And how you have to grab shotgun instead of the other guns because shotgun is like so much better than the other regular guns until you get better- until you get better equipment, obviously.

1299
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:16,990
There has to be friends somewhere.

1300
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,050
Is it because I just started that they put me in the baby lobby?

1301
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:24,250
No way.

1302
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,250
Where- where's everybody?

1303
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:30,130
Is it just because I'm in- oh my god.

1304
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,870
Are all of you guys like professionals now?

1305
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:39,210
I haven't seen anybody around me yet.

1306
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:41,490
There's no one here.

1307
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:45,110
All right, end search replay.

1308
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:53,770
Probably I'm in the baby lobby because of the stuff I've been doing.

1309
01:03:55,850 --> 01:04:03,890
They're like this- This person is not doing- this person forgot to bring ammo.

1310
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:07,130
We gotta put him in the baby lo- Oh my god.

1311
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:13,550
We gotta put her in the baby lobby until she knows how to bring ammo.

1312
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,810
You know like the bottom 500.

1313
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:27,670
They're like, all right, we gotta make sure she doesn't get like- She doesn't get killed by 20 people.

1314
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:30,790
She doesn't get killed by 20 people.

1315
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:36,410
See, see, this is where I'm showing skill-based matchmaking actually works, guys.

1316
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:40,890
I didn't bring ammo and then the game was like, oh no.

1317
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:48,770
They're like, oh no, she's one of those players.

1318
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:51,250
I'm crazy.

1319
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:55,710
The moment I get out of the kiddie pool, I'll show you how a real gamer works.

1320
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:56,710
Oh shit, nice.

1321
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:58,130
I got- I got gloves.

1322
01:04:59,210 --> 01:04:59,850
All right, nice.

1323
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:00,590
I got new requests.

1324
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:01,510
What's my new request?

1325
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:10,110
All right, the next mission is where my training wheel gets out- goes out.

1326
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,400
Obviously, the more missions you complete, the better rewards you get.

1327
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,540
This is the run.

1328
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,720
This is the run!

1329
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,560
This will be the run where we meet somebody.

1330
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,280
I'll get out of the kiddie pool today.

1331
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,080
This is where I get out of the kiddie pool.

1332
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:44,660
Yay!

1333
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,200
Helping- see guys?

1334
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,060
Helping others helps you.

1335
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,220
See?

1336
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,460
I love helping people.

1337
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:53,940
Real.

1338
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,460
All right.

1339
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,280
Uh, so I can- do I have enough money?

1340
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,380
If you're gonna play a garage, try repairing.

1341
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,100
Okay, this is where I have to- oh, I don't.

1342
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,120
I need more metal scraps.

1343
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:07,780
So I need to like, find more resources so I can upgrade my gaming pad.

1344
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,180
Yes, guys.

1345
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,760
Doesn't anyone want to be my friend?

1346
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:17,960
All right, so I need more- I need more repair kits because I'm running out of that.

1347
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:18,820
Which one- is this a shotgun?

1348
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,880
Okay, I'm gonna grab the shotgun.

1349
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,040
I'm gonna throw away the shotgun.

1350
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:26,600
Uh, we need shotgun because shotgun is the strongest gun in this- in this game.

1351
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,260
Uh, cable equipping both live and energy ammo.

1352
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:35,100
Uh, allows a long and high movement to reinforce improved damage reduction.

1353
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,720
Wait, it has damage reduction.

1354
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:37,300
Wait.

1355
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,260
Wait, that's good.

1356
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,260
All right, that's right.

1357
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,560
Now I have- okay.

1358
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,040
No, no, no.

1359
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:48,500
I should have- No, I should have the bad head so people will think I'm a baby.

1360
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:55,520
So they'll treat me nicer because I'm a ba- They'll treat me nicer because I'm a baby.

1361
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:59,820
So they'll be like, oh, oh man, obviously she doesn't know what she's doing.

1362
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,480
No, they don't look at- they- gamers don't look down.

1363
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,760
So they don't want to look at my legs.

1364
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,200
They won't look at my legs.

1365
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:15,040
It's gonna be a- We're gonna be- we're gonna- they'll think I'm a baby and then I'll give them like a false sense of security.

1366
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:25,300
And because I give them a false sense of security, um, they'll think that like, um, they'll think that, you know, um, I'm no threat.

1367
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,340
I'm not a threat to them.

1368
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,380
Okay, let's get rid of this.

1369
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,440
I have the heavy energy ammo.

1370
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,200
All right, they won't think I'm a threat.

1371
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,820
Gamers don't look up and down.

1372
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,540
Gamers just look in the center.

1373
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:43,560
Okay.

1374
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,460
That's me!

1375
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,060
Yeah, I got the correct ammo.

1376
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,180
What?

1377
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:03,620
Really?

1378
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:03,720
Really?

1379
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,200
Don't listen to him.

1380
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,800
Don't listen to him.

1381
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:20,040
Turn your- make sure to always turn your backs, especially towards baby drifters.

1382
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,380
Don't- he doesn't know what he's talking about.

1383
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,640
Don't listen to him.

1384
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,640
He's not even- he's not even hot.

1385
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,400
Are you really gonna listen to somebody that's not even hot?

1386
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:34,420
Hahaha

1387
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,520
Yeah, he doesn't know what he's doing.

1388
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,300
He doesn't even have actual legs.

1389
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,860
Come on, guys.

1390
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,340
Where's his legs?

1391
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:58,050
All right, this is where- this is where I get out of the kiddie pool.

1392
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:59,370
This is it.

1393
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:01,190
I'm ready.

1394
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,670
I'm out of the kiddie pool now.

1395
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:06,370
Okay, there has to be someone over here.

1396
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:12,190
I'm literally gonna go across the- What's my current objective?

1397
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:17,510
All right, hello, is there anybody here?

1398
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:23,770
Look, I'm holding a really bad gu- There's a faint sound.

1399
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:25,670
Wait, wait, there's people.

1400
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:26,890
Wait, there's people.

1401
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:27,950
Wait.

1402
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:29,830
There's people.

1403
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:31,810
Wait, you see that?

1404
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,390
You see that?

1405
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:34,050
That's a person.

1406
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,450
Hello.

1407
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,610
Hello, I am so friendly.

1408
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:42,450
Hello, I just got here.

1409
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:45,450
And I'm here to make friends.

1410
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:46,490
Hello.

1411
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:50,450
Where did he go?

1412
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:52,790
He was like right here.

1413
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:55,250
Wait, where did he go?

1414
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:05,390
No, those are- There's like regular PvE people.

1415
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:08,670
Wait, where's- Where did he go?

1416
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:11,590
Where did he go?

1417
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:12,570
He just drove away.

1418
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:15,990
Wait, he just disappeared.

1419
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:19,010
I don't like that he just disappeared.

1420
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:20,730
That's a little- I'm a little worried here.

1421
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:21,930
Wait, wait, I hear him.

1422
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:23,810
He's like close by.

1423
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:25,870
Hello?

1424
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:27,610
Friend?

1425
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:31,650
Where is he?

1426
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:34,250
I literally saw him roll by.

1427
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:36,950
But he left.

1428
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,650
All right, that's when you know he's easy.

1429
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,090
He ran away.

1430
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,750
Okay, let's just get rid of this guy first.

1431
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:47,670
Oh, okay.

1432
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:50,970
Now I realize the recoil for this.

1433
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:54,590
Okay, that- this recoil fucking sucks.

1434
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,950
Okay, give me a sec.

1435
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:02,330
Let me- let me start tapping.

1436
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,710
Let me start- start- oh, okay.

1437
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:06,870
At least this NPC has worse aim than me.

1438
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,150
Okay, get closer so I can do this.

1439
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:12,710
There we go.

1440
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:15,350
All right.

1441
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:24,270
No, I was using the worst gun in the game and then when he got closer I swapped my gun to the best gun in the game.

1442
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:26,770
Where did- where did he go?

1443
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:29,990
There was a person here.

1444
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:33,010
He just rolled away just like that?

1445
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,210
I don't understand.

1446
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:36,730
I was not a threat.

1447
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:39,610
I literally- wait, what?

1448
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,350
Wait, where?

1449
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:43,510
Where?

1450
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:44,710
Okay, give me a sec.

1451
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:45,790
Let me- wait.

1452
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:47,930
An association member?

1453
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,350
Wait a minute, where?

1454
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,070
Oh, hello?

1455
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,830
Oh, it's a rookie.

1456
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:00,450
He's a baby.

1457
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:03,970
He's a baby just like me.

1458
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:11,970
He's a baby just like me, but I don't want to get away- Wait, where did he go?

1459
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:15,350
Wait, where did he go?

1460
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:15,870
He disappeared.

1461
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:18,510
Wait, he disappeared again?

1462
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,270
Where did he go?

1463
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:22,930
Where- why did they all keep running away?

1464
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:29,950
I don't understand.

1465
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:32,590
I'm so friendly.

1466
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:36,190
How much more friendly could I be?

1467
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:41,890
I just wanted to say hi.

1468
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:44,350
He disappeared.

1469
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,370
He was literally right here.

1470
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:52,050
Oh my god, he was literally right here.

1471
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:52,850
I saw him.

1472
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:54,050
Wait, is that him?

1473
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,930
Is that- oh no, no, that's just- that's the enemy.

1474
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:00,430
Okay, I need to get rid of these guys.

1475
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:02,130
That's fine.

1476
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,330
The ring can't hurt me too much, right?

1477
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:06,970
Right?

1478
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,030
There's no way he's gonna shoot me.

1479
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:14,850
Oh shit!

1480
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:19,150
Okay, he is a lot tankier than I expected.

1481
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:25,350
What hit me?

1482
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:26,930
What hit me?

1483
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:28,110
What hit me?

1484
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,110
Oh no.

1485
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:30,510
Oh, no.

1486
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,050
Oh, no, it wasn't- it wasn't people.

1487
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:36,370
It was NPCs.

1488
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,810
Okay, it's okay.

1489
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:38,310
It's okay.

1490
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:39,090
It's okay.

1491
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:40,070
Everything is fine.

1492
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,950
Everything is fine.

1493
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:50,430
I've never struggled so much against NPCs.

1494
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:51,470
I don't understand.

1495
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:53,210
Why are they so strong?

1496
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,030
When did they become so strong?

1497
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:57,930
What?

1498
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:00,290
It equals minus 800 HP.

1499
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,030
Oh my god.

1500
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,290
Who made you?

1501
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:04,710
I'm still celebrating!

1502
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:08,370
Why is it still raining?

1503
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:18,330
Okay,

1504
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:23,030
it's okay.

1505
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:23,810
We'll stay here.

1506
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:25,030
We'll stay here.

1507
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:25,470
Okay.

1508
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:26,290
All right.

1509
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:28,390
Oh my god.

1510
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,690
How is it still raining?

1511
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:34,150
If only she could tell the weather.

1512
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,670
Everything is killing me.

1513
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,350
The nature is killing me.

1514
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:42,870
Guys,

1515
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:47,750
outside is dangerous.

1516
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:54,890
Please, I just wanna make friends.

1517
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,470
It's so rough out here.

1518
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,670
It's actually so rough.

1519
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:01,410
Right now.

1520
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,150
All right, everything will be fine.

1521
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,390
Everything is gonna be fine, guys.

1522
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:12,390
We might be like running a little low on HP, but like everything will be fine.

1523
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,730
Oh, I don't want to cross the river.

1524
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:16,410
The last time I crossed the river, it was not okay for me.

1525
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:17,030
I'm just gonna go.

1526
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,950
I'm just gonna go here.

1527
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:21,050
I am not crossing the river after last time.

1528
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:23,610
It's okay.

1529
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,430
I'm gonna make some friends, guys.

1530
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,370
I believe.

1531
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:30,490
I believe that we can find some friends.

1532
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:34,030
And nothing bad is gonna happen to us.

1533
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:34,810
Hello?

1534
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,190
Everything hurts.

1535
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:40,310
I didn't know...

1536
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:44,290
I didn't know the outside can be this dangerous.

1537
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,970
I didn't know.

1538
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,190
When did the outside get this bad?

1539
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:53,230
And there's matching?

1540
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:54,950
What could it be?

1541
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:57,610
Okay, let's...

1542
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:59,910
Let's grab...

1543
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:02,390
Wait, there's a fellow association member?

1544
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:04,510
Oh no.

1545
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,750
Friend?

1546
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:07,550
Friend?

1547
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:09,470
Wait, where?

1548
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,030
Oh, here.

1549
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:11,990
Friend.

1550
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,330
Oh my god, friend.

1551
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:20,430
Flush with the good stuff?

1552
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:23,950
Hmm...

1553
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:24,470
Hello?

1554
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:27,050
Oh.

1555
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:28,610
Hello?

1556
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:33,310
Wait, wait, wait.

1557
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:33,930
That's an elevator.

1558
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:34,830
I need the elevator.

1559
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:36,010
Hello, elevator.

1560
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:37,450
NOOOOO!

1561
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,710
I wanted to use the elevator!

1562
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:43,850
NOOOOO!

1563
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:47,530
We could've been friends!

1564
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:48,950
Oh!

1565
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:50,450
Whatever.

1566
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,270
We could've been friends!

1567
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:54,790
I don't understand!

1568
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:55,170
I don't understand!

1569
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:56,950
What is...

1570
01:16:56,950 --> 01:17:00,350
Why is everyone avoiding me?

1571
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:05,970
More friends?

1572
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,110
I just...

1573
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,650
I'm not even threatening!

1574
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:12,630
I'm just rolling around!

1575
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:14,810
There's no way he doesn't know.

1576
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:15,530
Look at me.

1577
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:16,490
Look at me.

1578
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:17,670
I'm literally a baby.

1579
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:19,230
How would he know?

1580
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:21,070
How would he know?

1581
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:21,130
Hello?

1582
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:24,270
Faint gunfire?

1583
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:25,570
Oh.

1584
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:26,390
Okay.

1585
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:32,150
Hello?

1586
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:33,930
Hi!

1587
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:36,910
Hi, friend!

1588
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:42,630
Wait, is he dead?

1589
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:45,550
Is friend dead?

1590
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,350
Wait.

1591
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,790
He's busy fighting a bandit.

1592
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:52,430
Oh, you know what that means.

1593
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:53,630
Wait, the bandit's still there.

1594
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:54,510
Wait, where did he go?

1595
01:17:56,850 --> 01:17:57,990
Wait, that's still a bandit.

1596
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:58,730
Wait, where did he go?

1597
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:02,470
Wait, where did the other guy go?

1598
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:06,750
Okay.

1599
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:08,590
It's time to third party.

1600
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,830
Oh no, he's on me.

1601
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:11,550
Oh no.

1602
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:14,830
I was trying to look for friend.

1603
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,330
They're both bandits!

1604
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,770
Where's the other guy?

1605
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:25,990
Wait.

1606
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:27,350
Magus hunter.

1607
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:29,570
Battle recommendations.

1608
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:30,870
Where's the other guy?

1609
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:32,710
Did they all just appear?

1610
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,370
Wait, the battle's over?

1611
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:36,750
No, he left.

1612
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:37,490
He ran away.

1613
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:39,370
Oh my god.

1614
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:42,750
I don't understand why all of them are so scared.

1615
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:48,950
There has to be like one guy that would want to be my friend.

1616
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:49,790
No, no.

1617
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,430
There was a real guy.

1618
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:52,850
His name was Lost.

1619
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:54,530
We were going to be friends.

1620
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:56,870
We were going to have an adventure together.

1621
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,690
But he disappeared.

1622
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:02,650
Why did they run away?

1623
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,450
I don't understand.

1624
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:08,010
Is this about teamwork?

1625
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:09,990
And friendship?

1626
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:11,310
Is it?

1627
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:15,870
Is it?

1628
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:18,650
This is basically reverse stream sniping.

1629
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,070
I'll get rid of these guys.

1630
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:24,530
These guys are scary.

1631
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,890
These guys like explode on you.

1632
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,170
And I don't want to deal with that.

1633
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:31,850
I found like three people.

1634
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:32,990
And they all ran away.

1635
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:33,970
It's actually crazy.

1636
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:36,950
I did not expect like everybody to just disappear.

1637
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:38,690
Oh, it's back here.

1638
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:40,470
It's this door again.

1639
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:43,450
Someone has to use the escape pod, right?

1640
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:47,210
Okay, I'm going to travel a little bit more.

1641
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:50,670
I don't understand.

1642
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:52,790
Like, look at me.

1643
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:54,770
What is there to be afraid of?

1644
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,170
Like, oh my god.

1645
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:58,270
Okay, we need to find shelter.

1646
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:59,770
Just in case it starts raining.

1647
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,010
I don't have the weather feature.

1648
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:10,870
Where's... I heard...

1649
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:12,850
I heard people running around.

1650
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,270
Is that friend?

1651
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:15,410
Friend!

1652
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:18,250
Oh my god, friend!

1653
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:20,810
Hello, friend!

1654
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:23,590
Friend!

1655
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,930
Do you not want to be friends with me?

1656
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:30,690
Oh my god.

1657
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:31,550
Okay, nevermind.

1658
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:32,810
Okay, that's a bandit.

1659
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:33,690
Okay, it's fine.

1660
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:34,910
It's fine.

1661
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:35,490
It's fine.

1662
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:36,430
That was just a bandit.

1663
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:37,490
That was an NPC.

1664
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:38,910
That's another NPC.

1665
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:41,010
Is there, like, anybody that's real?

1666
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,350
Are there real people?

1667
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:43,450
In my game?

1668
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:45,290
Okay.

1669
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:46,570
Wait, there's a friend right here.

1670
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:48,830
Friend.

1671
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,390
I'm going to slowly walk up to him.

1672
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,750
And then, non-threateningly.

1673
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:58,630
And then he'll be like, Oh my god, are you a good person?

1674
01:20:58,730 --> 01:20:59,730
And I'll be like, yeah!

1675
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:03,170
She said with confidence.

1676
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:05,770
Oh, come on.

1677
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:06,490
Look at me.

1678
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:08,070
Look at me!

1679
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:09,930
Come on!

1680
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:14,410
Look at me!

1681
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:17,730
Oh, there she is.

1682
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:19,130
Hello!

1683
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:22,050
Oh, origin!

1684
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:22,770
Wait.

1685
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:24,290
Drifter's soul.

1686
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:27,050
Wait, isn't that...

1687
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:27,350
Hello!

1688
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:31,070
Hello!

1689
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:32,310
Hello!

1690
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,430
Hello!

1691
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:37,010
I'm a new...

1692
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:39,330
I'm a new player!

1693
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:43,330
Hi!

1694
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:44,950
I'm a new player!

1695
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:47,090
Wait, he's ignoring me.

1696
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:49,630
Oh, he said hello!

1697
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:51,610
Okay, do you think he'll let me get close?

1698
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:53,930
Run away, Drifter.

1699
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:55,670
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1700
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:57,690
I'm pretty sure he'll want to be friends, right?

1701
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,150
Okay, I need to figure out how to get up though.

1702
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:03,030
Give me a sec.

1703
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,470
I need to figure out how to parkour.

1704
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:05,790
Where did he go?

1705
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:08,570
Wait, why is he running away?

1706
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:10,010
Oh, that's a bandit.

1707
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,670
Wait, is that...

1708
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:13,170
Hello!

1709
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:17,770
Hello!

1710
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:21,270
Hi!

1711
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:23,670
Friend?

1712
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:25,930
Hello?

1713
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:28,230
Hi!

1714
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:30,310
Yeah?

1715
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:33,190
Hi!

1716
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,330
I'm so happy to see you!

1717
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:38,110
I feel like I don't...

1718
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:39,430
I never see other people.

1719
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:40,510
Can we play together?

1720
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:42,510
Hi!

1721
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:45,670
Can we play together?

1722
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:46,050
There?

1723
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:51,790
We can work together to kill bandits together.

1724
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:52,790
Yeah!

1725
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:53,110
Yeah!

1726
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:56,350
Don't worry, I'll help you.

1727
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,030
I can help you.

1728
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:02,230
Oh my god, wait.

1729
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:03,530
He actually knows how to play this game.

1730
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:04,250
Wait a minute.

1731
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:07,390
Look at him dodge and weave.

1732
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:08,610
Wait a minute.

1733
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:12,170
Wait a minute.

1734
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:14,750
I think he actually knows how to play, guys.

1735
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:17,010
I'm a little...

1736
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:19,330
I'm a little worried.

1737
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:21,090
Yeah, he actually...

1738
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:22,190
He's like using...

1739
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:24,370
He's using cover and everything.

1740
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:26,610
He's actually playing...

1741
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,310
Okay, I'm gonna pretend to help him.

1742
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,170
And I'm gonna be like...

1743
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:33,210
But then he's gonna see me be like really bad.

1744
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:34,530
So he's gonna be like...

1745
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:37,390
Oh, that's cute that he's like trying, you know?

1746
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:40,350
That's cute that he's trying his best, you know?

1747
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:41,410
But then I'm like...

1748
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,130
But where did he go?

1749
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,270
Wait, where did he go though?

1750
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:46,990
How am I supposed to third party him if he just runs away?

1751
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:48,710
Wait, where did he go?

1752
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:52,510
Wait a minute.

1753
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,570
No, he disappeared my target!

1754
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:57,230
He disappeared!

1755
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:59,870
How am I supposed to steal his legs?

1756
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:03,350
Oh, shit.

1757
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:03,730
Okay.

1758
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,670
Oh, no.

1759
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:06,110
Okay.

1760
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:07,690
Oh, no.

1761
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:08,390
Oh, no.

1762
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:08,970
Oh, no.

1763
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:09,870
Where did he go?

1764
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:11,850
Oh, no.

1765
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:13,590
He disappeared!

1766
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,190
He disappeared!

1767
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:15,810
He was here!

1768
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:19,990
Okay, we have to leave anyway.

1769
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:21,550
We have five minutes left.

1770
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,310
Five minutes before the fun begins.

1771
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:25,990
I just realized what time it is.

1772
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:28,010
He like disappeared!

1773
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,610
I had a whole plan and everything!

1774
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:34,110
No legs today.

1775
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:37,490
When will I ever get my legs?

1776
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:39,170
I don't understand.

1777
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:39,710
I don't understand!

1778
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:43,550
I was gonna third party!

1779
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:47,110
I was gonna give him like a full sense of security!

1780
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:50,310
And then I was gonna shoot him in the back!

1781
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:51,710
And then now he's gone!

1782
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:54,750
Now he's just gone.

1783
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:57,510
I can't believe it.

1784
01:24:57,530 --> 01:25:00,710
This has been the hardest PvP run I've ever had.

1785
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:02,590
Yes, last time!

1786
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:03,910
Last time I like...

1787
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:05,890
Oh my god, last time was so easy.

1788
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:07,950
Like people were so...

1789
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:08,950
Like people...

1790
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,250
Nobody ran away.

1791
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:13,050
And everybody wanted to be friends.

1792
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:15,210
But like...

1793
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:16,430
I don't understand.

1794
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:18,550
Like...

1795
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:20,190
You can tell I look like a baby.

1796
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:23,070
I don't understand!

1797
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:25,550
Like...

1798
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:27,670
Another Kratos?

1799
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:30,050
Someone else wants to use it too.

1800
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:30,330
Okay.

1801
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:33,990
Someone else here.

1802
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:36,830
There's someone else here.

1803
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:37,810
I said another Kratos.

1804
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:39,530
Where are they?

1805
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:42,450
How did people learn?

1806
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:45,470
I thought like everybody would be nice.

1807
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:46,310
Like no...

1808
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:49,430
Nobody would be hardened by the lies.

1809
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:51,210
And cruel fate of the world.

1810
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,090
Nobody else here wants to escape.

1811
01:25:58,230 --> 01:25:58,890
Okay.

1812
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:01,650
I can't believe it.

1813
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:05,130
No one else wants to be my friend.

1814
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,590
The world is so messed up.

1815
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:09,310
The world...

1816
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:11,850
The world is so messed up.

1817
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:13,250
No one wants to be...

1818
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:16,330
I swear everybody just ran away from me.

1819
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:17,610
I don't understand.

1820
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:21,910
My entire mission was to just...

1821
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:22,710
Make friends.

1822
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:29,030
I think it is my first stream sniper.

1823
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:34,450
You're all so mean.

1824
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:35,950
I don't understand.

1825
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:42,070
Alright.

1826
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:45,590
How many people have I missed out on?

1827
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:48,110
Oh, there's me walking around.

1828
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:48,770
Look.

1829
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:49,010
Okay.

1830
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:49,670
I saw this guy.

1831
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:50,470
I saw him.

1832
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:51,190
Where did he go?

1833
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:53,450
We literally saw this man.

1834
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:54,930
Where the hell did he go?

1835
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:59,770
Time to see all the PvP we missed.

1836
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:01,630
Like, he just ran away.

1837
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,470
He was right here.

1838
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:05,110
This entire time.

1839
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,710
He was right here this entire time.

1840
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:13,870
He just stood there and watched me.

1841
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:14,450
Okay.

1842
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:21,490
Oh, and then he just...

1843
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,950
He just left.

1844
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:25,810
He was right here this entire time.

1845
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:26,450
He was...

1846
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:29,950
He was just watching me.

1847
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,130
He was just watching me.

1848
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:35,090
Alright.

1849
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,390
Oh.

1850
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:36,090
Oh my god.

1851
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:36,310
Wait.

1852
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:36,830
Wait.

1853
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:38,610
How did I miss like 20?

1854
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:39,710
Oh my god.

1855
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:40,430
What the...

1856
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:43,510
Oh no.

1857
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:44,350
That's the bandit.

1858
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:45,490
I was gonna be like, excuse me.

1859
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:46,670
What the heck is that?

1860
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:47,350
Okay.

1861
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:48,530
Alright.

1862
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:49,430
So we saw this.

1863
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,650
I need to know how many other people I missed out on.

1864
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:52,170
Okay.

1865
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:52,810
There's rain.

1866
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,470
And then...

1867
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:56,590
Why are the bandits like half-naked men?

1868
01:27:56,930 --> 01:27:57,090
Okay.

1869
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:58,230
There's Lawrence right there.

1870
01:27:58,290 --> 01:27:59,010
I saw Lawrence.

1871
01:27:59,110 --> 01:27:59,230
Yeah.

1872
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:00,410
I wanted to meet up with Lawrence.

1873
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:03,690
And then...

1874
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:05,610
I just walked past Lawrence?

1875
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:09,910
Where was Lawrence?

1876
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:11,110
Okay.

1877
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:12,770
And then I saw this guy.

1878
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:14,530
This guy was the one I...

1879
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:16,310
This guy I was trying to find.

1880
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:17,290
Oh, and then...

1881
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:20,510
He legitimately just walked past all the other hunters.

1882
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:24,790
And then there's one more guy over here too.

1883
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:27,130
And...

1884
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:31,610
There were three other people right here and I didn't see any of...

1885
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:32,390
I'm so blind.

1886
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:35,630
There were three other people around me and I didn't see them.

1887
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:37,110
But like, where did he go?

1888
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:38,410
Like, I...

1889
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:39,570
Where did he go?

1890
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:41,030
Okay.

1891
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:41,770
And then...

1892
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:42,890
I lost him here.

1893
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:45,910
I lost him right here.

1894
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:48,710
I was watching him fight these three bandits.

1895
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:51,210
And then he just disappeared.

1896
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:54,430
Where did he go?

1897
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:57,490
He just left!

1898
01:28:57,850 --> 01:28:58,270
He just...

1899
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:00,810
Oh my...

1900
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:05,930
They all...

1901
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:08,610
Lawrence is still there!

1902
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:09,790
Just sitting...

1903
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:13,450
Lawrence is still there!

1904
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:17,550
Let's just say that Lawrence is still just sitting there.

1905
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:20,230
Like...

1906
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:23,630
I traveled halfway across...

1907
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:25,390
And Lawrence never moved him.

1908
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:26,430
He's just surviving.

1909
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:28,870
He was just still there.

1910
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:30,490
I... Oh my god.

1911
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:32,410
Legend said he's actually...

1912
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:33,750
He's still just...

1913
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:34,470
Still there.

1914
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:35,250
Just sitting there.

1915
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,810
Some say he's still there to this day.

1916
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,350
Please.

1917
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:49,390
My only mission is to make a friend.

1918
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:51,110
That's all I want.

1919
01:29:51,330 --> 01:29:53,890
Why do they all want to run away from me?

1920
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:56,950
I don't understand.

1921
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:01,750
Do they not want to be my friend?

1922
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:03,850
I look so welcoming.

1923
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,750
I went on three expeditions...

1924
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:12,170
And everybody keeps running away from me.

1925
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:20,590
I...

1926
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:23,530
I can't even do any missions...

1927
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:25,410
Because I'm too busy trying to make friends.

1928
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:42,390
Oh, I know.

1929
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:43,290
I have a strat.

1930
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,970
I'm going to carry...

1931
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:46,070
Extra materials.

1932
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:48,810
And then when I see a friend...

1933
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,890
I'm going to drop some of my loot.

1934
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:52,010
And then...

1935
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,630
And then they'll turn their backs on me.

1936
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:55,170
Oh my god.

1937
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:55,910
I'm so smart.

1938
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:57,490
Okay, this is my new strat, guys.

1939
01:30:57,950 --> 01:30:58,810
Alright, let me see.

1940
01:30:58,890 --> 01:30:59,830
I need to grab...

1941
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:01,290
New health packs real quick.

1942
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,150
And then I'm going to grab this healing kit.

1943
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,530
Because I'm getting...

1944
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:06,910
I'm accidentally like...

1945
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:08,870
And then I'm going to grab...

1946
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:11,610
I'm going to give them...

1947
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:12,850
I'm going to grab ammo.

1948
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:14,070
I'm going to grab extra ammo.

1949
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:15,810
And then throw...

1950
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:16,650
Oh, you're right.

1951
01:31:16,690 --> 01:31:17,630
I'm going to rain shields.

1952
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:18,170
You're right.

1953
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:19,070
You're so right.

1954
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:21,090
I'm going to grab extra medkits.

1955
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:23,550
And I'm going to drop medkits to them.

1956
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:25,910
I'm going to grab one of each.

1957
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,430
And I'm just going to drop medkits.

1958
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:30,050
What are you trying to trick?

1959
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,570
They'll just think I'm really friendly.

1960
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,090
Guys, they're just going to think...

1961
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:36,690
I'm really, really friendly.

1962
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:38,950
This is it.

1963
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,570
This is where I'm going to finally make friends.

1964
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:42,010
This is it, guys.

1965
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:44,110
I'm going to finally make a friend.

1966
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,900
It's like RuneScape, you know?

1967
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:58,760
It's like ye olde RuneScape scams.

1968
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,980
Surely it'll work in this game.

1969
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,240
It has worked for decades.

1970
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,280
In RuneScape.

1971
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,900
It shall work in Simuality.

1972
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:08,060
Echo of Ada.

1973
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:17,820
Echo of Ada.

1974
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:19,680
Free gold trimming here, guys.

1975
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:22,480
Free armor trimming.

1976
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:24,980
All you have to do is just drop your armor.

1977
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:27,140
And then I'll trim it for you.

1978
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:32,340
I have played these games before.

1979
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:33,760
Alright, this time.

1980
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,180
Surely I'll make a new friend here.

1981
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:42,300
Surely it'll be different.

1982
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,600
Alright, let's see.

1983
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:47,780
Did I take out my legs?

1984
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:48,920
No, it's the same legs.

1985
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,780
Oh wait, hey, there's loot here.

1986
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,800
Okay, my entire mission...

1987
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,620
I'm not here to upgrade my house or anything.

1988
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,720
It's just to make one friend.

1989
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:58,560
That's all I want to do.

1990
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:00,180
Hello.

1991
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,260
I want to make a friend in my extraction shooter game.

1992
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:07,220
Hello, everybody.

1993
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,260
Anybody here?

1994
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:12,920
Surely there's one mecha that wants to talk to me.

1995
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:15,300
What about that we are not doing a bathtub?

1996
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:17,800
I refuse to give my wife a bathtub.

1997
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,500
If I can't shower, she can't shower.

1998
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:25,220
Okay, I hate...

1999
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:28,120
Okay, nice.

2000
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:29,600
These take two shots!

2001
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:35,680
These guys take two shots but then the other one takes like 20.

2002
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,380
Okay, friend.

2003
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,320
Hello!

2004
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:43,100
Anybody wants to be my friend?

2005
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,740
There's a faint sound of an engine.

2006
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:48,520
There's a friend nearby.

2007
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,200
Antenna?

2008
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,680
There has to be.

2009
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:56,960
There's someone rolling around.

2010
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:58,420
Okay.

2011
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:02,780
These are bandits, so they're like NPCs.

2012
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:04,500
But like, where's...

2013
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,500
Where's real people?

2014
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:06,680
Hello?

2015
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:09,660
Any friendships here?

2016
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:14,200
Hello, I'm just a little baby learning how to play the game.

2017
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:18,380
And like, nothing bad's gonna happen to you when we get close together.

2018
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:21,100
We're just gonna have a good time.

2019
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,580
We're gonna work together.

2020
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,980
Gathering materials and resources.

2021
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,380
Like good friends should do.

2022
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:33,120
Hello?

2023
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,740
Hello, anybody?

2024
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:37,960
Hello?

2025
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:42,800
Why is it so quiet?

2026
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,240
Hello?

2027
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,560
Hello?

2028
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,700
Please!

2029
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,980
It's so lonely!

2030
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,820
I'm so alone!

2031
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:02,420
I'm so alone!

2032
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:02,620
Please!

2033
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,980
I'm like the last mech on Earth!

2034
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,960
Please, it's so lonely!

2035
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:19,540
I'm gonna bet Toki ran past 20 people.

2036
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,880
I'm so alone!

2037
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,940
Is there anybody that wanna be my friend?

2038
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:36,210
Please!

2039
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:42,270
I keep killing my friends.

2040
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:45,030
I can't even say that!

2041
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:47,350
I haven't killed a single soul!

2042
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:56,150
I rode all the way here and not a single soul has been found!

2043
01:35:59,230 --> 01:36:00,030
Alright.

2044
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:01,570
It's alright.

2045
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:03,570
Any dragoons too?

2046
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:07,610
Oh wait, no.

2047
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:09,890
Oh wait, these are like regular.

2048
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:17,090
Oh my god, that's right.

2049
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:18,910
Okay, that was a little scary.

2050
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:20,770
That was not gonna lie, a little scary.

2051
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:23,050
I thought I was gonna get hit.

2052
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:27,290
There has to be like at least one person around.

2053
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:29,130
Alright, we're gonna go here.

2054
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:31,150
Let's see if we can see anything.

2055
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:34,390
I keep using emotes instead of...

2056
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:36,490
Instead of doing like the crystal search.

2057
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:40,630
Oh my god!

2058
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:41,710
Almost shot my wife.

2059
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:44,190
Not the green ones!

2060
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:45,550
The green ones are strong!

2061
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:48,610
I don't trust the green ones.

2062
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:54,130
Hello?

2063
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:56,350
Anybody?

2064
01:36:56,350 --> 01:36:57,150
Anybody?

2065
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,570
Anybody here?

2066
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,230
Please?

2067
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:05,290
I just wanna be somebody's friend!

2068
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:11,450
Please?

2069
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:15,170
I'm here to bring free armor trimming here!

2070
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:20,150
I'm here to drop free armor trimming!

2071
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:23,170
How do I drop?

2072
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,750
Look at that!

2073
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:28,130
Free armor trimming right here!

2074
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:30,230
Faint sound of engine.

2075
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,310
There's one nearby.

2076
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,030
Where are they?

2077
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:38,310
Faint...

2078
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:39,190
Faint engine.

2079
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:41,570
That means there's someone nearby.

2080
01:37:43,410 --> 01:37:44,930
Where could they be?

2081
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:46,170
Come on.

2082
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:47,490
I hear them.

2083
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:50,370
My wife said she heard somebody.

2084
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:54,150
Hello?

2085
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:57,900
Hello?

2086
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,080
You guys heard that?

2087
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:08,000
Guys, I swear I'm not going crazy.

2088
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:09,220
I heard something.

2089
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:10,240
I swear.

2090
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:12,320
I heard something.

2091
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,420
There's no way I'm not going crazy, guys.

2092
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:16,700
Something came up.

2093
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,400
Hello?

2094
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:26,680
Anybody?

2095
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:26,940
Please?

2096
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:29,940
Please?

2097
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,740
I'm gonna go insane.

2098
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:32,680
Please?

2099
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:37,220
I don't even want to kill no more.

2100
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:40,840
I just want to know that I'm not alone.

2101
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,080
Hello?

2102
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,380
Wait!

2103
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:53,980
Friend!

2104
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:54,300
Friend!

2105
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:54,700
Friend!

2106
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,180
Hello?

2107
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:59,560
Coffin Ogre!

2108
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:00,900
Hello?

2109
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:04,960
Hi!

2110
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:10,180
Oh my god!

2111
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:12,900
Hey there!

2112
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,080
Can I follow you?

2113
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:16,120
Hi!

2114
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:19,440
Hi there!

2115
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:21,700
I was so alone!

2116
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:28,380
I was looking for somebody for the longest time!

2117
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,320
I thought I was alone.

2118
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:33,080
I thought I was the last mech on Earth.

2119
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:37,880
I was desperate for human contact.

2120
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:42,300
Sir, please stop right away!

2121
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,740
Why?

2122
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,280
Why are you running away from me?

2123
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:49,240
Please!

2124
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,260
Come back!

2125
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,120
Please!

2126
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:52,720
He knows!

2127
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:54,880
Come back!

2128
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:58,140
Where did he go?

2129
01:39:58,500 --> 01:39:59,300
Where did he go?

2130
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,080
He actually disappeared!

2131
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,060
Please!

2132
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:05,300
Drifter, please!

2133
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:06,980
I was so alone!

2134
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,200
Why are you running?

2135
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,360
I was so alone!

2136
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:17,280
I just wanted human contact!

2137
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:21,380
I was so alone and I was scared!

2138
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,200
Don't shoot me!

2139
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,700
I just want friends!

2140
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:29,720
I just want friends!

2141
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,900
Oh my god!

2142
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,320
I'm so happy!

2143
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,460
You're real!

2144
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:47,820
You're a real person!

2145
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,080
Let's stay together!

2146
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:57,200
You're real!

2147
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,000
Let's all work together!

2148
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,480
I'll give you something.

2149
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:09,180
Do you want that?

2150
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,220
Do you want that?

2151
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:16,700
Look at that!

2152
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:18,680
Oh my god!

2153
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:28,900
Let's walk together!

2154
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,460
Let's build a friendship together!

2155
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:32,920
Drifter!

2156
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:34,040
Let's go!

2157
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:35,160
Yeah!

2158
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:37,940
Let's go!

2159
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:42,900
Oh my god!

2160
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,460
What do you want to do?

2161
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:46,440
Yeah?

2162
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:53,320
Oh!

2163
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:54,180
Wait!

2164
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:54,780
Don't!

2165
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:55,800
Don't leave me!

2166
01:41:56,780 --> 01:41:58,760
Don't leave me!

2167
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,580
Don't leave me!

2168
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:01,560
Can I follow you?

2169
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,900
Don't leave me!

2170
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:07,340
Hey!

2171
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:09,580
I thought we were friends!

2172
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:10,280
Stop!

2173
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:11,480
Don't run away!

2174
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:13,420
Can I follow you?

2175
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:13,680
Oh my god!

2176
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:19,400
What do you mean?

2177
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:20,560
Come on!

2178
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,000
Let's all walk together!

2179
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:27,600
Nothing bad is gonna happen to us!

2180
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,180
Whoa!

2181
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:30,320
Wait, what happened?

2182
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,300
What is that?

2183
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,480
What is that?

2184
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:36,060
What are you doing?

2185
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:37,880
What?

2186
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,160
I don't think I can...

2187
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:40,560
What?

2188
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:42,280
What did he do?

2189
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:43,720
What?

2190
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:47,400
Are these...

2191
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,640
Are these things that you can...

2192
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,200
Oh, it's his later mission.

2193
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,320
Wait, how...

2194
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:56,280
Wait, how high level is this guy?

2195
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:03,380
I'm just a baby.

2196
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,000
There's nothing wrong.

2197
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:06,800
It's rain!

2198
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,360
We should get cover!

2199
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,020
To get there?

2200
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:11,040
Oh!

2201
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,800
Oh, thank you!

2202
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:20,420
Wait, why did he give me my repair kit back?

2203
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,000
Wait, that's another drifter!

2204
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:24,820
Wait, that's another drifter!

2205
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:25,520
Who is he?

2206
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,540
Oh my god, let's all...

2207
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:30,420
Let's all sit down here...

2208
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:32,260
And become good friends!

2209
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:33,760
Who's this?

2210
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,080
Hey there!

2211
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:36,680
Hey friend!

2212
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:39,860
We're all good friends now, right?

2213
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:41,900
Hello?

2214
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:45,120
Oh my god, there's three of us now!

2215
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,400
Oh, he is?

2216
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,340
Hey!

2217
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:53,440
Hi!

2218
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:56,180
My new target...

2219
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:58,520
Because he's a baby just like me.

2220
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,640
Hahaha!

2221
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:03,860
Friend 2!

2222
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:04,960
Hey!

2223
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:05,400
Hey!

2224
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,600
Come on, I dropped this for you!

2225
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,180
Rearmor trimming!

2226
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:16,360
The other target, I was like...

2227
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:16,480
Hey!

2228
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:19,700
Rearmor trimming!

2229
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:21,940
Wait, he's not taking it!

2230
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,620
Oh, he took the bait!

2231
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:25,380
He took it!

2232
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:26,760
He took the bait!

2233
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:27,880
He knew it!

2234
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:30,240
Okay, it's working!

2235
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:31,880
It's working!

2236
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:35,160
Okay, wait, I got an idea!

2237
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:37,840
Take this!

2238
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:39,860
There's a rope here!

2239
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:41,540
Take this!

2240
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:43,300
Yeah, you don't want the rope?

2241
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,600
Oh, I know what you want!

2242
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,120
Hahaha!

2243
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:55,940
Hahaha!

2244
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,080
Oh!

2245
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:05,160
Hey!

2246
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:07,900
Hahaha!

2247
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:11,880
Hahaha!

2248
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:15,200
Hahaha!

2249
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:17,520
Hahahaha!

2250
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:18,820
He was...

2251
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:19,700
Hahaha!

2252
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:22,860
Hahaha!

2253
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:24,700
Oh my god.

2254
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:26,860
I told you.

2255
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,640
Oh my god.

2256
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,580
Oh shit, where did I put my heels?

2257
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,860
He walked away.

2258
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,780
Guys, it's okay.

2259
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,440
He walked away, guys.

2260
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,340
Oh no!

2261
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:41,040
No!

2262
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:42,700
No!

2263
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:44,820
Wait.

2264
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2265
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:46,540
I swear.

2266
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,160
I swear.

2267
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:48,420
I swear.

2268
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:48,700
I swear.

2269
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:51,760
I swear.

2270
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,060
I swear he did it first.

2271
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:55,100
He shot first.

2272
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,220
I swear to god.

2273
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:00,720
I swear to god he shot first.

2274
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,500
I swear.

2275
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:03,460
Please.

2276
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:04,560
I did it.

2277
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,260
I found him like that.

2278
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,660
I swear to god I found him like that.

2279
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:12,160
I swear.

2280
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,960
I swear to god.

2281
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,040
I swear.

2282
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:25,620
He was like that when I got there, didn't he?

2283
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:26,900
Wait, I didn't steal his legs.

2284
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:27,880
Let me get his legs first.

2285
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:29,240
Let me get my trophy.

2286
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:34,100
Let me get my trophy real fast.

2287
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:37,460
Guys, this is... Oh no.

2288
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:38,560
Oh no.

2289
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,320
Wait, there's... I hear them.

2290
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:43,160
I can't get my trophy if they come down.

2291
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:45,000
I swear.

2292
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:48,180
He turned around and he was just dead.

2293
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:49,920
There's no way.

2294
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:52,800
Oh my god.

2295
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:55,000
How am I supposed to get my trophy?

2296
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,160
He hit me.

2297
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,500
Oh my god.

2298
01:46:59,600 --> 01:46:59,760
Okay.

2299
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:03,060
Can you get rid of stuff?

2300
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:05,540
What's my inventory limit?

2301
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:05,980
Okay.

2302
01:47:08,620 --> 01:47:11,320
Why can't I grab the legs?

2303
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,160
No, it's 300.

2304
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,320
Oh.

2305
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:16,920
Oh.

2306
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:17,720
Hello.

2307
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:18,660
Hi.

2308
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:21,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2309
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:27,040
I didn't... He shot first.

2310
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,880
He shot first, I swear to god.

2311
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:29,940
He shot first.

2312
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:30,520
Look, look.

2313
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:31,400
He shot first.

2314
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:34,000
He... I swear.

2315
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:35,500
He shot first.

2316
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:36,580
I swear to god.

2317
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,340
I swear he shot first.

2318
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,180
I tore the body.

2319
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:45,360
It wasn't me.

2320
01:47:45,820 --> 01:47:46,160
Oh.

2321
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:47,340
Oh.

2322
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,560
I swear to god.

2323
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:49,420
He shot first.

2324
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:50,980
Let me grab the legs.

2325
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:53,220
Please.

2326
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:55,940
I didn't mean it.

2327
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:03,640
I gotta leave the scene of the crime.

2328
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:04,520
Oh no.

2329
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:05,700
Oh no.

2330
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:07,060
I gotta leave the scene of the crime.

2331
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:10,740
Oh no.

2332
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:12,540
Oh no.

2333
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,340
Oh no.

2334
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,520
There's no way.

2335
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:19,540
There's no way.

2336
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,620
Who shot me?

2337
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:23,820
It wasn't the other guy.

2338
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:24,900
It was someone new.

2339
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:26,760
It was someone new.

2340
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,000
It wasn't even the original guy.

2341
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,420
It wasn't even the original guy.

2342
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:36,280
It was a different guy that shot me.

2343
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:37,620
He was spectating.

2344
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,920
He was a witness, but where was he?

2345
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,380
There was a witness that I didn't know of.

2346
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:47,180
There was a witness that I didn't know existed.

2347
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:53,480
I don't even know who the witness was.

2348
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,440
There was a peeping tom that saw everything.

2349
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:01,980
Oh my god.

2350
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,760
I know I'm trying to get to a safe place.

2351
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,640
I don't trust the other area.

2352
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:14,440
There was a witness everyone, but I don't know where he went.

2353
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:16,120
Where did he come from?

2354
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,240
The other guy looked away.

2355
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:27,900
The thing is, the first guy, he looked away.

2356
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:34,600
He judged me, but he looked away and pretended nothing happened.

2357
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:38,400
There was a secret second witness that I do not know of.

2358
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,260
I don't know where he... No, not the rain.

2359
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,140
Not the rain.

2360
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:48,260
I don't know where to go.

2361
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:55,920
I need to head to the... I need to find a way to... Oh no, I have to go here.

2362
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:56,860
This has to be closer.

2363
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,940
I need to figure out how to get there though.

2364
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:03,880
I'm so lost.

2365
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,920
Oh my god, I'm so lost.

2366
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:08,000
I only have two minutes.

2367
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:11,880
I'm so lost, everyone.

2368
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:16,120
Okay, okay, this is it.

2369
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,060
I'm trying!

2370
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:19,340
Oh no.

2371
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,360
Oh no, no, no.

2372
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:22,300
Two minutes.

2373
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:25,080
I'm cutting it so close right now.

2374
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:25,820
I'm overheated.

2375
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:27,520
I'm trying my best.

2376
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:30,780
Wait, wait.

2377
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:34,120
I think it's the second witness.

2378
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:36,100
I think he's hunting me down.

2379
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,720
Oh my god, the second witness is hunting me down.

2380
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:45,100
Oh my god, I hear the second witness.

2381
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:46,680
He's near me.

2382
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:47,420
He's nearby.

2383
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,800
The second witness is nearby.

2384
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:50,400
I hear him.

2385
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:51,920
I actually hear him.

2386
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:53,780
He's somewhere near me.

2387
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:56,780
The second witness...

2388
01:50:59,460 --> 01:50:59,660
Hello?

2389
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,480
Oh my god.

2390
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,200
He saw me!

2391
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:12,740
Oh, wait, wait, no.

2392
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:13,940
He's friendly.

2393
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:15,640
He's friendly.

2394
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:20,380
Wait, is he not the second witness?

2395
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,100
Was he not the hidden cop?

2396
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:25,440
Is he?

2397
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:27,700
Oh fuck, I don't know.

2398
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:29,820
I don't know if he was the secret cop.

2399
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,160
I don't know.

2400
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:40,000
10, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7...

2401
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,960
No!

2402
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:43,460
No!

2403
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:44,260
He was!

2404
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:46,940
He was the second witness!

2405
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:48,940
No!

2406
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:51,960
He was!

2407
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:56,240
He was the cop this entire time!

2408
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:58,300
It was him!

2409
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:01,060
I couldn't tell!

2410
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:02,780
I couldn't tell if he

2411
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,650
was...

2412
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,190
I thought I counted correctly.

2413
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:14,090
He saw everything.

2414
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:17,850
He actually saw everything.

2415
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:21,030
Oh my god.

2416
01:52:21,410 --> 01:52:23,610
Crap doesn't pay.

2417
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:26,350
Oh my god.

2418
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:29,170
Oh my god.

2419
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:32,350
I can't believe it.

2420
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:34,590
I knew he was the cop!

2421
01:52:34,830 --> 01:52:40,150
I could tell he was the cop by trying to like... See, I could sneak into the elevator.

2422
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:50,510
I can't believe it.

2423
01:52:57,330 --> 01:52:58,930
No, he was the witness.

2424
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:01,090
He saw me kill the first baby.

2425
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:03,610
He saw me.

2426
01:53:04,030 --> 01:53:10,410
He was the one that was up in the hill with a fucking sniper and saw it all.

2427
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:16,190
My DLC legs.

2428
01:53:22,140 --> 01:53:22,950
Wait, what?

2429
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:25,090
He took my wife?

2430
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:27,770
Wait,

2431
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:32,630
did he take my wife?

2432
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:39,830
Oh my god, are you okay?

2433
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:45,250
Oh, oh man.

2434
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:46,870
Okay.

2435
01:53:58,270 --> 01:53:59,050
Um.

2436
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:00,630
Oh.

2437
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:04,070
I don't.

2438
01:54:05,050 --> 01:54:05,550
Oh.

2439
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:06,810
Hello.

2440
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:07,610
Um.

2441
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:08,910
Oh.

2442
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:12,530
You'll lose all the items you're carrying.

2443
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:14,050
You'll lose.

2444
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:16,730
You can pick up starter items for free though.

2445
01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:19,150
Oh.

2446
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:22,370
You're running low on ceiling kits.

2447
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:24,590
Better stock up before the next sorting.

2448
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:30,310
Maybe I should have let him take my wife.

2449
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:33,730
Maybe I'm the shithead.

2450
01:54:35,190 --> 01:54:36,530
Oh man.

2451
01:54:37,290 --> 01:54:38,710
My legs.

2452
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:41,750
My beautiful legs.

2453
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:48,610
My beautiful legs.

2454
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:50,250
They're all gone.

2455
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:51,710
There must be.

2456
01:54:51,790 --> 01:54:54,650
Wait, I must be able to buy starter guns, right?

2457
01:54:55,530 --> 01:54:56,110
250?

2458
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:57,150
Okay, there we go.

2459
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:57,650
Nice.

2460
01:54:57,770 --> 01:55:01,030
I can buy the starter shotgun.

2461
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:02,170
Okay.

2462
01:55:03,090 --> 01:55:04,670
And then, there we go.

2463
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:05,870
Things will be fine.

2464
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:07,590
Things will be fine.

2465
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:11,730
I can't believe they took my legs.

2466
01:55:11,730 --> 01:55:14,910
I can't believe it.

2467
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:17,070
I'm angry now.

2468
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:18,970
I'm so angry.

2469
01:55:19,810 --> 01:55:21,690
Wait, I got new legs!

2470
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:24,290
Oh, but it's not the same.

2471
01:55:25,150 --> 01:55:29,110
My DLC legs that I got for free because I got sponsored.

2472
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:33,110
Now they got my DLC legs.

2473
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:34,590
They got it.

2474
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:36,510
What's the point?

2475
01:55:37,150 --> 01:55:38,610
What's the point?

2476
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:38,730
Wait.

2477
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:45,910
Not the exclusive legs.

2478
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:49,670
I had to preorder.

2479
01:55:51,490 --> 01:55:52,990
Oh my god.

2480
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:55,610
Now it's like they don't even have to spend...

2481
01:55:56,210 --> 01:55:59,030
I lost my sponsor merch, guys.

2482
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:00,670
He took my merch.

2483
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:06,430
He took my Jordans.

2484
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:10,710
Alright, fix up my home.

2485
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:11,910
I'm sad now.

2486
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:18,340
I can't believe it.

2487
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:21,460
I didn't realize he saw.

2488
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:25,000
The other drifter looked away.

2489
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,740
I didn't have enough bribes.

2490
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,320
I didn't have enough bribes.

2491
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:37,760
What?

2492
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:40,740
Alright, nice.

2493
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,340
So you just make... She basically does nothing.

2494
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:49,000
It says she upgraded the floor, but it looks just as messed up as before.

2495
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:50,500
I don't know.

2496
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:52,900
That's definitely... Look, she's still learning.

2497
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,480
My wife is still learning, guys.

2498
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:58,620
She was born last week, so guys, come on.

2499
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,400
Guys, please.

2500
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:03,560
Have mercy on my wife.

2501
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:04,340
We got beat up.

2502
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,560
We got robbed, okay?

2503
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:09,280
We got robbed by an undercover cop.

2504
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:09,880
Like how?

2505
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:10,980
Come on, guys.

2506
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:17,640
We're having it really rough right now.

2507
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:21,420
We don't even have a bathroom.

2508
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:24,140
She has to look like this right now.

2509
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:27,480
You did this to her.

2510
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:35,460
I was brought to justice.

2511
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,500
I was unarmed.

2512
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,360
He shot an unarmed citizen who was with his wife.

2513
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:44,080
I was with my wife.

2514
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:53,560
That's the ceiling?

2515
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:55,260
How did I...

2516
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:56,840
Oh my god.

2517
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:57,640
No, please don't.

2518
01:57:57,740 --> 01:58:00,520
No, we're so poor and now we're eating weeds too.

2519
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:03,940
Oh no, she's feeding me weed.

2520
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:04,980
I forgot.

2521
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:07,520
Oh my god.

2522
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:12,300
We're not... Our home life is not okay right now.

2523
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:17,560
Our home life is really rough right now.

2524
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,520
We can't even afford real food.

2525
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:26,520
We can't even afford real... I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2526
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:28,760
I'm so sad.

2527
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,600
I'll be right back.

2528
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:37,880
Look, just because my wife can't use the bathroom doesn't mean I can't either.

2529
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:39,400
Okay, guys.

2530
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,520
At least one of us has to win something.

2531
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,680
Okay, we're gonna do this strat again because it clearly worked out for us.

2532
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:54,900
So all we need to do is we're gonna put some... We're gonna grab some health packs.

2533
01:59:55,180 --> 02:00:00,220
And then so like they'll think I'll be like free armor trimmings again.

2534
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:02,060
And it's gonna... It worked.

2535
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:02,620
It worked.

2536
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:07,980
What I... I just didn't bring enough armor trimming for the other witnesses.

2537
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:12,380
Okay, I just... I didn't bring enough, guys.

2538
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:17,900
I brought enough for one witness and he looked away.

2539
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,780
But I didn't bring enough for two witnesses.

2540
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:22,480
I didn't bribe enough people.

2541
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:23,720
That's the thing.

2542
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:24,920
It did work.

2543
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:27,660
I just didn't account for a second bribe.

2544
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:31,900
I... I didn't bribe the cops, okay?

2545
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:35,860
I forgot about bribing the cops to get away with murder.

2546
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:37,700
That was my problem.

2547
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:39,360
That was... And it's raining?

2548
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:42,540
Like I came in here and it has to rain?

2549
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:45,600
Where the... Where is the crowd?

2550
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:47,420
Are you serious?

2551
02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:49,260
I just got here.

2552
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:51,800
How could it rain now?

2553
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:53,480
Okay.

2554
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:58,680
Alright, let's figure out how to get out of... Let's figure out how to get covered.

2555
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:03,160
I can't believe it's raining.

2556
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:04,740
I literally just got here.

2557
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:07,560
I just arrived.

2558
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,080
Alright.

2559
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:15,900
These guys die super fast.

2560
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:17,720
Nice.

2561
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:19,980
Okay, and then let's grab some...

2562
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:22,020
Oh my god.

2563
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:25,220
Not having good nigs sucks so much.

2564
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:28,780
Like, what do I do when I can't zoom zoom?

2565
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:30,220
Oh.

2566
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:35,260
Stop dissing the weatherman.

2567
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:38,520
I can't believe it.

2568
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:41,520
I didn't bring enough bribes.

2569
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:44,440
I... I forgot to pay off the police.

2570
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:52,360
I paid off the... I paid off the residents, but not the police.

2571
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:55,660
No sign of pursuit.

2572
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:57,200
Who was I escaping from?

2573
02:01:57,980 --> 02:01:59,940
Okay, we gotta... we gotta go here.

2574
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:02,480
We must bump into somebody.

2575
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:05,480
It's okay.

2576
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:06,080
It's okay.

2577
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:07,300
I figured it out.

2578
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:08,720
I figured out how to win.

2579
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:09,980
It's alright.

2580
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:13,740
I have like... I have... I have like stronger armor too.

2581
02:02:14,380 --> 02:02:15,980
Oh my god, it's taking so long.

2582
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:17,600
What do we do to this world?

2583
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,260
Why is it still raining?

2584
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:20,260
I don't understand.

2585
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:22,160
Don't worry.

2586
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:22,900
Everything will be okay.

2587
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,660
Everything will be okay.

2588
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:28,360
We just need to wait until the rain stops.

2589
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:31,980
I'm gonna have the shittier gun out so they won't see me as a threat.

2590
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:33,460
So they know what they think.

2591
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:35,000
Like, oh, she doesn't know what she's doing.

2592
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:37,580
She has the... she has the bad gun.

2593
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:39,140
Alright.

2594
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:41,940
No, no, no, no, no.

2595
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:43,020
Don't harvest me.

2596
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,460
I'm just a... I... I just have money.

2597
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:46,040
That's it.

2598
02:02:46,340 --> 02:02:48,180
Please don't harvest me.

2599
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:49,600
I paid for this DLC.

2600
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:50,880
Please.

2601
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:53,000
I actually got it for free, but they don't know that.

2602
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,680
They'll be like, oh my god, this poor guy.

2603
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:57,400
This poor guy.

2604
02:02:57,900 --> 02:03:03,020
She really wanted to play this game and paid for the DLC for the DLC armor parts.

2605
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:05,580
Like, we're not gonna hurt her.

2606
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:08,420
Alright, here we go.

2607
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:10,140
Oh hey, nice.

2608
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:11,900
Wait, we needed these crystals anyway.

2609
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,580
Let's excavate this real fast.

2610
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:15,980
Be careful, Doki.

2611
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,220
There are dragoons out.

2612
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:18,380
There's no way.

2613
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:23,700
A dragoon would want to let me have... a dragoon would want me to have their legs.

2614
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,460
Are you serious?

2615
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:26,540
Are you serious?

2616
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:29,720
Oh no, not the green end.

2617
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:32,520
These guys are so annoying.

2618
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:34,900
They're so strong!

2619
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,240
Okay, I'm gonna slap you.

2620
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:39,140
Oh my god, I'm...

2621
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:41,500
Oh, now you're gonna run, you little bitch?

2622
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:45,000
Okay.

2623
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:47,280
It's fine.

2624
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:47,760
We're fine.

2625
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:49,220
Alright, let's go over here.

2626
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:54,000
The other dragoons would want me to collect their legs as a trophy.

2627
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:58,760
Okay, that's fine.

2628
02:03:59,780 --> 02:03:59,980
It's fine.

2629
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:03,600
There's a faint sound of an engine.

2630
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:06,320
That means there's people rolling by near me.

2631
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:08,200
Hello, friends?

2632
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:09,580
Friends!

2633
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:15,620
Hello, any vulnerable mechs out there that would like to be friends with me?

2634
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:20,620
I am just a lowly poor mecha...

2635
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:25,460
that wants to befriend all the other mechas in the town.

2636
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:28,960
Let me just slap them real fast.

2637
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:31,400
Reload.

2638
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:32,800
Hello?

2639
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:36,760
Hello, any kind-hearted mechs...

2640
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:42,060
that wanna travel the mecha world with me...

2641
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:44,200
but nothing bad happens?

2642
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:46,460
Hello?

2643
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,440
Anybody?

2644
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:50,660
Come on!

2645
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:53,660
Don't we all love friendship here?

2646
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:58,040
Wait, faint gunfire?

2647
02:04:58,860 --> 02:05:01,060
Okay, that means it's like...

2648
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:02,520
Okay, it's definitely close by.

2649
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:04,380
But there's faint gunfire.

2650
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:07,300
Hello?

2651
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:10,840
Hello, friends?

2652
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,480
I'm just a baby.

2653
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:15,520
I don't know what I'm doing.

2654
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:20,520
He's right here.

2655
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:21,260
Oh, he's right here.

2656
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:23,020
He's right here.

2657
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:27,260
Wait, wait a minute.

2658
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,780
Wait, excuse me?

2659
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:32,520
Wait, an excavation person died.

2660
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:33,940
Wait a minute.

2661
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:36,980
That's a little concerning.

2662
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:39,580
Wait a minute.

2663
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:43,840
There is a dead excavation member here.

2664
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,750
Okay, um...

2665
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:48,260
I'm a little worried now.

2666
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,900
Somebody killed someone near me.

2667
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:54,280
And it wasn't me.

2668
02:05:56,740 --> 02:05:57,160
Wait, what?

2669
02:05:59,060 --> 02:05:59,580
Where?

2670
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:05,680
There's an...member?

2671
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:07,840
Down here?

2672
02:06:10,540 --> 02:06:13,220
He said there's like 20 different things.

2673
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:16,580
Are they here?

2674
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:22,700
Caution?

2675
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:35,800
Wait a minute.

2676
02:06:39,580 --> 02:06:40,720
We gotta leave.

2677
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,840
We gotta leave.

2678
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,660
We gotta leave.

2679
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:52,560
We gotta leave.

2680
02:06:52,820 --> 02:06:53,660
That's a killer.

2681
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:57,020
That's a killer.

2682
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,140
I was like, why he gold?

2683
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:02,580
And then I'm like...

2684
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:03,340
Oh...

2685
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:06,720
Oh, he...

2686
02:07:07,470 --> 02:07:07,840
Oh...

2687
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,480
He's gold.

2688
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:13,850
I was like...

2689
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:15,200
Wait, that's a...

2690
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:16,220
That's a weird color.

2691
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:20,700
That's a weird color.

2692
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:23,280
I've never seen that color before.

2693
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:24,280
I...

2694
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:32,860
Oh, that is definitely not friend-shaped, guys.

2695
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:33,900
That is...

2696
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:36,560
That is not friend-shaped.

2697
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:39,880
Guys, you thought I was like...

2698
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:42,500
This guy actually kills for fun.

2699
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:43,440
He wasn't...

2700
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:46,340
You see, I'm being paid to kill for fun.

2701
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:47,500
This guy...

2702
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:48,520
He paid...

2703
02:07:48,860 --> 02:07:53,140
He paid Bandai to kill for fun.

2704
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:53,740
Like...

2705
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:56,400
I got paid by Bandai to kill for fun.

2706
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:58,640
But he paid Bandai for this.

2707
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:00,260
So you know...

2708
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:01,300
You know I'm dead.

2709
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:02,280
I'm...

2710
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:06,560
That's when I know I have to run.

2711
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:07,820
That's...

2712
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,280
Sounds fun.

2713
02:08:11,700 --> 02:08:12,920
That's when I know.

2714
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:14,680
That's when I know.

2715
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:19,380
He doesn't put the love of the game in nothing else.

2716
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:20,580
Yeah, I gotta leave.

2717
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:22,680
I don't trust that man.

2718
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:25,000
I 100% do not trust him.

2719
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,560
Alright, let's just move on.

2720
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:33,880
I don't...

2721
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:34,680
I don't trust...

2722
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:37,680
I don't think I...

2723
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:39,720
What is this?

2724
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:44,540
Alright, let's see what we can find.

2725
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:45,980
Any crystals.

2726
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:50,360
Oh, we have the escape pod here.

2727
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:52,540
Hello?

2728
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,340
Hello, tiger.

2729
02:08:58,600 --> 02:08:59,040
Hi.

2730
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:00,960
Hey.

2731
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:03,260
Hey, you want some loot?

2732
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:03,820
Here.

2733
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:05,440
Here, buddy.

2734
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:06,420
Here.

2735
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:09,340
Hey.

2736
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:10,580
You want this?

2737
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:14,020
Hello?

2738
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:15,880
Thanks.

2739
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:20,240
Can I come over and...

2740
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:20,540
Look, look, look.

2741
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:22,660
I don't mean to hurt you.

2742
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:24,240
I don't mean to harm you.

2743
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:24,860
Come on.

2744
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:28,580
I don't mean to hurt you.

2745
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:29,000
Here.

2746
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:31,740
Wait, where did it go?

2747
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:34,480
Wait, where did I drop it?

2748
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:37,500
Wait, where did I drop my thing?

2749
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:39,120
Where did it go?

2750
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:41,080
Did it fall into this?

2751
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:42,740
Where did it go?

2752
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:44,780
Where did my...

2753
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:47,300
Where did my heals go?

2754
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:49,240
Hello?

2755
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:51,900
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

2756
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:52,680
Here, here, here.

2757
02:09:54,660 --> 02:09:55,060
Here.

2758
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:58,240
Here.

2759
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:01,620
Take this.

2760
02:10:03,660 --> 02:10:04,520
Take this.

2761
02:10:08,660 --> 02:10:09,840
I forgot to shoot.

2762
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,400
I got it wrong.

2763
02:10:12,940 --> 02:10:14,640
I was gonna shoot him.

2764
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:17,420
God damn it, I forgot to shoot.

2765
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:20,420
I was trying to pick up my items.

2766
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:25,940
I wanted to pick it up.

2767
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:31,440
I was trying to pick up my heals and I forgot to shoot him.

2768
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:34,780
Because I was like, wait a minute, I don't want to lose this.

2769
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:38,140
I didn't want to lose my heals.

2770
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:40,100
And he fell.

2771
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:46,380
I lost my heals too because I glitched into the goddamn elevator.

2772
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:49,100
I don't win.

2773
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,560
I just don't win.

2774
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:57,780
I was like, wait a minute, I don't want to lose this.

2775
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:06,360
I donated my items to the elevator.

2776
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:10,640
And she actually made them for us.

2777
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:14,200
I was like, oh no, I don't want to lose this.

2778
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,040
I don't want to lose this item.

2779
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:21,380
She is so fucking devilish.

2780
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:25,180
I'm so sad.

2781
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:26,740
I was so...

2782
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:29,020
The elevator has been fed.

2783
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:33,600
It was so nice to trip that guy's armor for free.

2784
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:38,940
I'm so sad.

2785
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:40,100
I was so close.

2786
02:11:41,220 --> 02:11:42,520
Oh my god.

2787
02:11:43,180 --> 02:11:44,900
I was just like, oh man.

2788
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:46,860
My item.

2789
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:48,240
I'm so sad.

2790
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:49,880
I'm so scared about my item.

2791
02:11:50,380 --> 02:11:51,360
Hey guys, hey.

2792
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:58,360
Oh my god, look at his legs.

2793
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:00,660
Oh, that could have been...

2794
02:12:00,660 --> 02:12:01,520
Okay, I'm doing one more.

2795
02:12:01,860 --> 02:12:03,120
That could have been my legs.

2796
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:05,500
That could have been my legs.

2797
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:06,820
Because he didn't even have a shotgun.

2798
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:15,700
I'm so sad.

2799
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:21,000
I got so preoccupied with making sure I picked up my items.

2800
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,300
I forgot to shoot.

2801
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:32,620
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

2802
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:38,900
I'm seeing you log some progress for a request.

2803
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:40,620
Oh my god.

2804
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:41,760
I'm so sad.

2805
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:42,700
One more.

2806
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:43,640
One more.

2807
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,580
I need at least one murder.

2808
02:12:45,940 --> 02:12:47,540
I need...

2809
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:48,760
I need a...

2810
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:50,620
I need one trophy leg.

2811
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:51,880
That's all I want.

2812
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:52,540
I need...

2813
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:55,360
I need one trophy leg.

2814
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:56,940
I don't need much.

2815
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:01,040
I just need to be able to have one leg.

2816
02:13:02,620 --> 02:13:03,900
That's all I want.

2817
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:06,200
I need one trophy leg.

2818
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:09,900
I donated all my goddamn heals.

2819
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:10,660
Okay.

2820
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:11,900
Armor trimming.

2821
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:14,060
I got my armor trimming right here.

2822
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:16,040
Okay, manage, divide.

2823
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:18,380
Okay, wait.

2824
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:19,460
How do I...

2825
02:13:19,460 --> 02:13:20,960
How do I divide this?

2826
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:24,440
Okay.

2827
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:26,280
One.

2828
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:28,060
Okay, there we go.

2829
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:28,900
And then...

2830
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:30,220
There we go.

2831
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:32,300
I have two armor trimmings right there.

2832
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:33,900
Okay, this is it.

2833
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:34,680
This is where...

2834
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:35,780
This is where we're gonna do it.

2835
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:36,820
This is it.

2836
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:38,920
Alright.

2837
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:40,280
We're gonna...

2838
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:41,080
I need one...

2839
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:42,260
I just need one trophy leg.

2840
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:42,760
That's it.

2841
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:43,400
I don't care.

2842
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:45,820
I need to bring back home a trophy leg.

2843
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:46,300
I need...

2844
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:51,100
I need...

2845
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:53,200
I need to bring home just...

2846
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:54,980
That's all I asked for.

2847
02:13:55,900 --> 02:13:56,400
That's...

2848
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:57,940
That's all I need.

2849
02:13:57,940 --> 02:13:58,640
A trophy.

2850
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:07,640
Also, I just got word from the devs...

2851
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:09,480
And the code does not expire.

2852
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:10,460
So...

2853
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:11,740
So, do not...

2854
02:14:11,740 --> 02:14:12,680
You don't have to rush to get it.

2855
02:14:12,700 --> 02:14:13,920
The code doesn't expire.

2856
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:16,500
I just got word.

2857
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:18,680
So, good news, everybody.

2858
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:19,560
Good news.

2859
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:22,360
Alright.

2860
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:25,860
Okay, this time it'll work, guys.

2861
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:27,680
I can scam somebody.

2862
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:29,020
This time.

2863
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:31,060
I think I'll be like...

2864
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:32,140
Wow, Doki, you did it.

2865
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:33,260
You actually made a friend.

2866
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:37,880
Doki, isn't that what you wanted all along?

2867
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:42,000
I thought you wanted to make a friend all along, Doki.

2868
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:45,220
Isn't that what you were trying to accomplish?

2869
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:48,420
Yeah.

2870
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:50,520
A friend.

2871
02:14:57,400 --> 02:14:57,960
Okay.

2872
02:14:58,900 --> 02:14:59,200
Alright.

2873
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:00,580
Surely, we'll meet somebody.

2874
02:15:01,780 --> 02:15:02,320
Friend?

2875
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:03,520
Friend?

2876
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:05,280
Any friends here?

2877
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:07,900
Wait, what?

2878
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:08,920
What's left behind?

2879
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:10,240
Oh, wait.

2880
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:11,420
That's somebody's body.

2881
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:14,060
At least...

2882
02:15:14,060 --> 02:15:14,340
Oh, wait.

2883
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:14,440
No.

2884
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:15,760
They're like the bandits, right?

2885
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:17,980
Friends?

2886
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:20,320
You should be...

2887
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,680
I'm so happy, guys.

2888
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:23,360
I've always wanted to make...

2889
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:24,960
I've always wanted a brother.

2890
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:29,740
Oh, somebody's been killing all these bandits.

2891
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:32,180
There's a bandit killer here.

2892
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:36,340
Which is good because I don't have to worry about the bandits shooting me.

2893
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:38,460
Hello, everyone!

2894
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:42,120
I'm here for friends.

2895
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:44,180
Hello?

2896
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:47,480
Anybody here?

2897
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:50,060
Anyone at all?

2898
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:54,000
That's why I know.

2899
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:55,160
That's why I need to avoid that.

2900
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:59,680
Wait, that geezer is shooting someone.

2901
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,220
He's shooting somebody.

2902
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:03,080
That means someone's here.

2903
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:05,080
Hello?

2904
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:09,260
Hi.

2905
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:11,420
Hi.

2906
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:13,620
Hi.

2907
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,600
What the fuck?

2908
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:17,660
What?

2909
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:21,460
Why did he put the shield up?

2910
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,260
I'm not trustworthy!

2911
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:26,380
Why did you put the shield up?

2912
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:31,620
He built a wall!

2913
02:16:35,740 --> 02:16:39,020
He built a goddamn wall!

2914
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:41,680
He didn't even trust me!

2915
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:44,340
He didn't even say hi!

2916
02:16:48,410 --> 02:16:51,360
He actually built a wall.

2917
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:54,920
All I did was like, hi.

2918
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:58,700
I didn't even get a chance to say hi and he built a wall.

2919
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:00,660
That man had zero trust.

2920
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:03,860
He said not today.

2921
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:05,520
Trust nobody.

2922
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:09,120
I didn't even say hi.

2923
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:12,960
He just assumed I was gonna kill him.

2924
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:14,540
I mean, I was going to.

2925
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:19,200
He didn't have to assume it right away.

2926
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:21,680
What happened to trust, guys?

2927
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,740
What happened to friendship here?

2928
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:30,480
What happened to innocent before proven guilty?

2929
02:17:32,060 --> 02:17:34,120
Kids these days.

2930
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:36,200
Guy has kids.

2931
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:43,540
Wait, there's a...

2932
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:45,520
Wait, there is a...

2933
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:47,140
There's another friend nearby.

2934
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:51,080
They auto-blocked for animal request.

2935
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:56,060
There's an engine nearby.

2936
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:59,220
Wait, what's that?

2937
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:02,940
Wait, there's...

2938
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:05,140
There's someone here.

2939
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:06,780
There's someone here.

2940
02:18:06,860 --> 02:18:07,620
They opened it.

2941
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:09,280
Hello!

2942
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:16,560
What?

2943
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:18,800
I don't understand.

2944
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:21,640
Why does everyone leave?

2945
02:18:22,220 --> 02:18:23,740
I just...

2946
02:18:26,460 --> 02:18:28,860
No reason.

2947
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:31,860
Oh my god.

2948
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:34,660
I can't believe it.

2949
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:39,660
What happened to innocent until proven guilty?

2950
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:44,200
When did children not stop trusting others?

2951
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:46,920
That's so messed up, guys.

2952
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:50,120
They know what you wanted to do.

2953
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:54,660
Word has spread of your armor trimmings.

2954
02:18:55,220 --> 02:18:56,660
Word has spread.

2955
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:02,340
Wait, he's shooting somebody.

2956
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:04,400
Wait, that thing.

2957
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:05,420
That NPC.

2958
02:19:06,860 --> 02:19:08,120
He's chasing after someone.

2959
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:11,060
You were proven.

2960
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:12,460
They don't know that.

2961
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:14,200
How do they know?

2962
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:16,000
How do they know?

2963
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:18,340
This is my fresh run.

2964
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:20,460
How would they know?

2965
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:23,740
Okay, that guy is chasing after someone.

2966
02:19:28,820 --> 02:19:31,040
Wait, I thought he was chasing after somebody.

2967
02:19:32,940 --> 02:19:34,080
Where is it?

2968
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:37,700
Oh my god.

2969
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:41,340
Wait, they clearly...

2970
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:43,900
That was chasing someone.

2971
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:45,740
It was chasing somebody.

2972
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:48,320
I thought I saw him chasing someone.

2973
02:19:50,140 --> 02:19:51,720
Let me just kill this real fast.

2974
02:19:53,580 --> 02:19:54,820
There we go.

2975
02:19:56,820 --> 02:19:59,500
Oh my god, there has to be more people here.

2976
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:02,120
Alright, I'm gonna make some noise.

2977
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:03,720
Gonna make some noise.

2978
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:06,560
Come on, I just need one leg.

2979
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:08,160
Just one leg.

2980
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:09,780
Like...

2981
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:11,160
One tiny leg.

2982
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:12,980
That's all I asked for.

2983
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:18,400
That's all... I'm just committing one crime.

2984
02:20:19,540 --> 02:20:21,100
I commit one crime.

2985
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:24,000
Like, everybody gets one pass, you know?

2986
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:27,660
Like, you know how like when you're a child, you can commit like...

2987
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:29,000
You know, you can do one wrong thing.

2988
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:30,840
This is my one wrong thing.

2989
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:32,860
That's all I want.

2990
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:39,780
Can I not just commit one thing and then I'll be like an upstanding citizen for the rest of my life?

2991
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:46,660
And then after that, I won't do anything bad ever again.

2992
02:20:48,060 --> 02:20:49,520
No, you don't know that.

2993
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:49,980
I bribe...

2994
02:20:50,580 --> 02:20:51,740
I bribe witnesses.

2995
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:54,040
It's not even on my record.

2996
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:55,200
Oh my god.

2997
02:20:56,140 --> 02:20:57,200
Okay, I might need to heal though.

2998
02:20:57,920 --> 02:20:59,400
I might need to heal after that.

2999
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:01,560
I need to make sure I'm full HP for my crime.

3000
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:08,740
Wait, wait, wait.

3001
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:10,120
There has to be like...

3002
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:11,780
At least one.

3003
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:16,760
Let me get rid of this guy real fast.

3004
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:20,300
Come on, one guy!

3005
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:22,640
One guy!

3006
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:24,540
I can't get one guy!

3007
02:21:28,340 --> 02:21:29,240
Give me a sec.

3008
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:30,880
I need to find shelter now.

3009
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:33,140
I need to find cover.

3010
02:21:33,740 --> 02:21:34,800
The ring!

3011
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:38,120
There's too many polygons on the ring too!

3012
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:42,360
Okay, crawler.

3013
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:45,080
There has to be cover somewhere here.

3014
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:47,240
We're literally in the city.

3015
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:49,380
There has to be one cover.

3016
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:50,600
I didn't bring any...

3017
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:53,340
I didn't bring any mega armor heals here.

3018
02:21:54,220 --> 02:21:56,740
There has to be... Oh my god, please.

3019
02:21:56,860 --> 02:21:59,320
I just need like a tiny bit of cover, please.

3020
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:03,620
Oh...

3021
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:09,460
Oh, of course the weather gets better when I... Oh my god, the weather gets better when I...

3022
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:11,920
When I'm trying to find the cover.

3023
02:22:13,180 --> 02:22:14,500
Loli, thank you for the super chat.

3024
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:15,240
Thank you, thank you.

3025
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:16,260
You want their leg?

3026
02:22:16,480 --> 02:22:18,280
I don't know you...

3027
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:21,180
Okay, I'm not finishing that super chat.

3028
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:23,820
I'm not finishing that super chat.

3029
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:28,080
Like, where did everybody go?

3030
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:32,880
Where did they all go?

3031
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:36,540
I don't want to stray too far from the escape portal.

3032
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:38,880
Because like the other ones are like...

3033
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:42,620
One is like all the way here and the other one is like all the way on the other side.

3034
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:44,840
So like I want to be close to...

3035
02:22:44,840 --> 02:22:46,720
I want to be sure I'm like here.

3036
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:49,100
Like close to here so I don't have to worry.

3037
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:52,860
Everything is just PvE.

3038
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:55,300
Hello?

3039
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:57,420
Any friends?

3040
02:22:58,100 --> 02:23:03,720
I just played this game today and all I want to do is make a friend so I can tell everybody...

3041
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:07,700
How a wonderful experience I had and how everybody was so nice and kind to me.

3042
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:10,120
Like and we all want to work together.

3043
02:23:11,940 --> 02:23:15,240
Like I just want to spread the good word about how...

3044
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:16,460
Everyone here...

3045
02:23:18,260 --> 02:23:20,720
Wants to work together and like...

3046
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:23,260
Become good friends with me and like...

3047
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:27,240
We all go on many adventures together and it's crazy how...

3048
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:30,540
A lifelong 10 year friendship started because of...

3049
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:32,340
Senuality, Echo of Ada.

3050
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:33,760
That's all I want.

3051
02:23:34,820 --> 02:23:35,820
The lies.

3052
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:38,080
No, no, no, no.

3053
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:39,700
I'm just really lonely.

3054
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:43,120
Cut stuff.

3055
02:23:43,300 --> 02:23:44,540
I sound so pathetic.

3056
02:23:45,220 --> 02:23:51,260
I sound so pathetic right now.

3057
02:23:56,100 --> 02:24:00,560
I don't want to be the last mech alive.

3058
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:03,580
Wait, I hear...

3059
02:24:03,580 --> 02:24:04,960
Wait, there's bandits here.

3060
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:07,840
But he's shooting somebody.

3061
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:12,840
He was shooting someone.

3062
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:19,260
Okay, that's a bandit but...

3063
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:21,260
Where's the...

3064
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:23,460
Where's the regular...

3065
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:23,660
Wait.

3066
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:25,440
The battle is over.

3067
02:24:27,060 --> 02:24:29,020
But where is the...

3068
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:30,600
Where's the cradle?

3069
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:38,420
Where are they?

3070
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:40,400
I don't understand.

3071
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:42,440
Where is...

3072
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:44,400
I just want one person.

3073
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:45,880
One person...

3074
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:46,060
Wait.

3075
02:24:46,340 --> 02:24:47,640
Wait, is he chasing after somebody?

3076
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,700
No, he's just rolling around.

3077
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:53,320
Hello?

3078
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:58,260
Is there anybody that wants to go see the bandit?

3079
02:24:59,380 --> 02:25:02,760
There's a lot of really juicy loot over here.

3080
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:06,680
Hello?

3081
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:10,960
Look at all that juicy loot.

3082
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:13,420
Just lying around.

3083
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:15,440
Oh my god.

3084
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:20,640
I'm never gonna...

3085
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:24,640
I either find nobody or I find five people.

3086
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:26,820
That wants me dead.

3087
02:25:27,180 --> 02:25:28,080
There's no in between.

3088
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:31,040
Or somehow I made a friend.

3089
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:34,520
After everything I've been through, I just made...

3090
02:25:34,520 --> 02:25:35,360
I would make a friend.

3091
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:41,480
It's not gonna work?

3092
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:43,480
Then how do I find people?

3093
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:44,520
How?

3094
02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:48,820
How can one achieve friendship?

3095
02:25:52,140 --> 02:25:53,540
Did you hear that?

3096
02:25:54,960 --> 02:25:56,260
Did you hear that, guys?

3097
02:25:57,080 --> 02:25:58,140
Wait, I heard something.

3098
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:02,920
Okay, no, that's a bandit.

3099
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
No, I heard something.

3100
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:05,500
I swear.

3101
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:06,740
I heard something.

3102
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:08,660
I swear to god.

3103
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:10,720
It wasn't a bandit.

3104
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:11,840
It was like a real person.

3105
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:14,060
I swear to god, I'm not crazy.

3106
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:16,560
I heard a real person just then.

3107
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:21,680
I swear.

3108
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:23,700
Oh my god.

3109
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:28,180
I'm not going crazy.

3110
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:30,160
I'm not.

3111
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:31,940
I swear, I'm not.

3112
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:34,240
There was a real person.

3113
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:36,660
I heard the... I heard the engine.

3114
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:39,140
I heard it the moment we look at the map.

3115
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:41,400
The moment we look at the map, we'll know.

3116
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:45,320
This has to be the hardest mission I've ever had.

3117
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:48,060
Finding one real... finding a friend.

3118
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:52,740
I'm not hearing things.

3119
02:26:52,820 --> 02:26:53,880
I'm not going crazy.

3120
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:56,060
I'm not going crazy.

3121
02:26:56,540 --> 02:26:58,120
There was a real person.

3122
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:01,220
There was a real person.

3123
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:05,120
Okay, I'm gonna go...

3124
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:07,400
I'm gonna go to the...

3125
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:11,220
Okay, that...

3126
02:27:11,220 --> 02:27:11,980
Whoops.

3127
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:16,180
Guys, there's fall damage if you forgot.

3128
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,060
Okay, it's okay.

3129
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:21,680
It's okay.

3130
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:24,820
Oh, there's no way that hits me.

3131
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:29,440
Yeah, I was gonna say, there's no way.

3132
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:32,160
I'd be so sad if that actually hit me.

3133
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:35,220
This is quite the rare item.

3134
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:37,820
Okay, maybe I'm...

3135
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:40,820
We don't have a reason to attack them.

3136
02:27:41,060 --> 02:27:41,360
Hello.

3137
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:44,260
And how are you today?

3138
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:44,680
Hello.

3139
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:47,720
I've detected the drive sounds of an incoming cradle.

3140
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:48,600
Oh, hello.

3141
02:27:48,760 --> 02:27:50,160
Do you want me to...

3142
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:52,900
This one's in good standing with the Association.

3143
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:54,100
No!

3144
02:27:55,140 --> 02:27:55,920
Incoming fire.

3145
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:57,280
The source is...

3146
02:27:57,920 --> 02:27:58,560
Oh my god.

3147
02:27:58,660 --> 02:27:59,540
The Association member?

3148
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:02,200
Oh my god.

3149
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:02,580
That's right.

3150
02:28:03,780 --> 02:28:05,500
That's fucking right!

3151
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:06,180
I'm better!

3152
02:28:06,860 --> 02:28:09,460
I'm so much better than you!

3153
02:28:09,980 --> 02:28:11,320
That's right!

3154
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:14,420
Oh my god, you got him!

3155
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:17,020
Bro, I was gonna do armor trimming!

3156
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:25,540
Oh my god, if I died to...

3157
02:28:25,540 --> 02:28:31,480
If I died to an NPC after everything I've been through, I would have been so sad.

3158
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:32,800
I got a leg!

3159
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:34,560
I got a leg, everybody!

3160
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:42,800
Oh my god, why does he take 20 years to kill?

3161
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:48,520
How is he still alive?

3162
02:28:50,140 --> 02:28:52,820
Oh my god, I can't loop because he's like on me.

3163
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:55,380
Oh my god, thank god.

3164
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:56,380
Okay, I got the leg.

3165
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:58,500
I got the leg, everyone.

3166
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:00,320
I'm stealing your husband!

3167
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:04,580
I'm gonna steal your goddamn husband!

3168
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:06,980
Oh my god!

3169
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:09,820
Where's your legs?!

3170
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:14,160
That's right!

3171
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:17,540
I stole your husband!

3172
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:23,940
Beta male, here's your goddamn beta male!

3173
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:25,260
I need cover.

3174
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,280
I swear to god, if I die before...

3175
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:34,320
Oh my god, if I swear to god, after everything I've been through and I die because of rain, I'm so sad.

3176
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:36,020
I'd be so sad.

3177
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:48,620
Disapply.

3178
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:53,540
They self-destructed so I don't have legs?!

3179
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:55,280
Hello.

3180
02:29:57,100 --> 02:29:57,400
Hello.

3181
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:01,460
Hi.

3182
02:30:04,660 --> 02:30:05,120
Hi.

3183
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:06,480
Woah, woah, woah.

3184
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:08,120
Hi.

3185
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:11,680
What the hell?

3186
02:30:12,220 --> 02:30:13,260
Battery remaining?

3187
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:14,100
Half.

3188
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:17,280
How are you today?

3189
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:21,280
One of your rounds almost hit an assassination target.

3190
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:24,760
Play with fire and we'll debrief you once we're back in the garage.

3191
02:30:24,780 --> 02:30:25,760
We still made it.

3192
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:28,500
I got a little caught.

3193
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:32,420
I was like, I want two pairs of legs.

3194
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,080
That's awkward.

3195
02:30:39,460 --> 02:30:40,460
That was awkward.

3196
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:48,160
I got, I was like, but what if I had two pairs of legs?

3197
02:30:55,380 --> 02:31:01,300
I'm so sad, he self-destructed just to prevent me from stealing his legs.

3198
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:04,660
There were two people right here and I didn't see them.

3199
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:09,700
I was like, I told you, I wasn't hearing things.

3200
02:31:09,860 --> 02:31:11,920
I knew I heard them.

3201
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:14,020
I told you I wasn't hearing things.

3202
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:20,180
I knew I heard, there were four, there were seven people around me.

3203
02:31:20,660 --> 02:31:22,600
Oh my god.

3204
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:26,480
There were actually seven people around me.

3205
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:32,420
And I didn't see any of them.

3206
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:34,880
I thought I was alone.

3207
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:38,700
I knew I wasn't crazy.

3208
02:31:39,080 --> 02:31:41,640
I knew I wasn't crazy.

3209
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:49,180
There were four right here.

3210
02:31:54,320 --> 02:31:56,180
Oh my god.

3211
02:31:56,580 --> 02:32:00,280
I was just walking around trying to find one guy.

3212
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:03,660
They were Bruce and Steve Snipes.

3213
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:11,560
Oh my god.

3214
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:14,160
Hiding from the serial killer.

3215
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:21,540
I killed two people and now I'm a criminal?

3216
02:32:22,220 --> 02:32:23,760
I don't know about that.

3217
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,060
That feels a bit unfair.

3218
02:32:26,060 --> 02:32:31,160
It feels a little bit unfair.

3219
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:35,060
One of them was self-defense, technically.

3220
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:38,440
Technically, one of them was self-defense.

3221
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:42,380
I was gonna do my armor trim scam and he shot me.

3222
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:45,960
I don't understand why.

3223
02:32:46,660 --> 02:32:49,840
It wasn't like my scam was gonna hurt anybody.

3224
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:52,920
Like...

3225
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:58,540
My scam wasn't actually gonna hurt no one.

3226
02:33:01,970 --> 02:33:03,450
Who did I kill?

3227
02:33:07,710 --> 02:33:14,230
He asked for that fight.

3228
02:33:14,550 --> 02:33:16,370
He could've had a free health kit.

3229
02:33:23,990 --> 02:33:25,830
Wait, but like, who was it?

3230
02:33:25,950 --> 02:33:27,190
Who was the guy I killed?

3231
02:33:27,410 --> 02:33:29,370
I like how I never left this area.

3232
02:33:33,450 --> 02:33:34,270
Wait, that was...

3233
02:33:34,270 --> 02:33:36,210
That was a trap!

3234
02:33:37,310 --> 02:33:38,350
Who was it?

3235
02:33:38,970 --> 02:33:41,230
Murray, I stole your husband.

3236
02:33:41,430 --> 02:33:42,910
What you gonna do about it?

3237
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:48,970
Yeah, it was a trap.

3238
02:33:51,550 --> 02:33:52,610
That's right.

3239
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:55,890
If you want your husband back, you gotta pay for it.

3240
02:33:55,970 --> 02:33:57,670
Oh my god, that was...

3241
02:33:57,670 --> 02:34:01,570
No wonder he did not believe me.

3242
02:34:06,750 --> 02:34:09,230
That's the other dragoon I tried to tell.

3243
02:34:13,370 --> 02:34:16,190
That's right, you gotta pay for him back.

3244
02:34:16,630 --> 02:34:18,290
This is a hostage situation.

3245
02:34:18,470 --> 02:34:19,890
I demand a ransom.

3246
02:34:19,890 --> 02:34:21,890
I'm demanding a ransom right now.

3247
02:34:23,550 --> 02:34:25,470
I like how he...

3248
02:34:25,470 --> 02:34:30,010
I like how he like, armored up and like, put on health too.

3249
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:32,410
He did not trust me at all.

3250
02:34:34,830 --> 02:34:37,650
And I almost got away with it too.

3251
02:34:38,010 --> 02:34:40,350
I almost got away with it.

3252
02:34:44,250 --> 02:34:45,610
Zero fate.

3253
02:34:46,510 --> 02:34:49,030
You guys wanna see the guy I kidnapped?

3254
02:34:49,490 --> 02:34:50,930
Wait, where is it?

3255
02:34:52,050 --> 02:34:53,110
Where's the guy I kidnapped?

3256
02:34:56,010 --> 02:34:56,750
Look at that.

3257
02:34:57,790 --> 02:35:00,650
I got $280,000!

3258
02:35:01,890 --> 02:35:07,390
That's right, if you want your husband back, I demand $280,000.

3259
02:35:11,370 --> 02:35:13,230
I rescued him.

3260
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:17,670
We're rich!

3261
02:35:17,910 --> 02:35:19,290
We're rich!

3262
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:22,910
It's okay, this is better than legs.

3263
02:35:23,450 --> 02:35:25,730
Guys, this is actually better than legs.

3264
02:35:25,810 --> 02:35:29,730
I stole some... I kidnapped somebody and got rewarded for it.

3265
02:35:30,670 --> 02:35:33,830
Woah, kidnapping's pretty profitable.

3266
02:35:36,750 --> 02:35:37,350
Yay!

3267
02:35:39,250 --> 02:35:41,210
Finally, we end on a high.

3268
02:35:42,470 --> 02:35:45,130
We end on a goddamn high.

3269
02:35:47,270 --> 02:35:48,550
It works!

3270
02:35:50,370 --> 02:35:52,370
Kidnapping works, let's go!

3271
02:35:53,130 --> 02:35:53,670
End game.

3272
02:35:53,870 --> 02:35:54,810
End game, guys.

3273
02:35:55,030 --> 02:35:55,510
End game.

3274
02:36:00,770 --> 02:36:01,530
Yay!

3275
02:36:03,650 --> 02:36:05,410
Let's apply what we learned.

3276
02:36:06,110 --> 02:36:08,170
What did we learn today, dragons?

3277
02:36:09,390 --> 02:36:12,110
What did we learn today?

3278
02:36:15,390 --> 02:36:18,190
Alright, I think it was a good time to call it.

3279
02:36:18,310 --> 02:36:22,090
Wow, what a wild... I feel like every playthrough gets more wild.

3280
02:36:22,610 --> 02:36:25,510
Every playthrough, something new happens, guys.

3281
02:36:28,230 --> 02:36:32,110
Anyway, it was a great time streaming for all of you guys.

3282
02:36:32,110 --> 02:36:41,090
Especially for the new viewers on Bandai's official channel on YouTube and Twitch.

3283
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:43,750
For those who are new here, my name is DokiBrain.

3284
02:36:44,010 --> 02:36:47,990
I am an indie VTuber specializing in FPS and shooter-type games.

3285
02:36:48,170 --> 02:36:51,410
And that's why I'm here to talk about Senuality.

3286
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:54,310
Senuality for you guys.

3287
02:36:54,670 --> 02:36:58,110
And I do have an exclusive cosmetic, as you see my waifu is wearing.

3288
02:36:58,190 --> 02:36:58,890
It's a little dirty.

3289
02:36:59,370 --> 02:37:02,090
We got sort of messed up earlier.

3290
02:37:03,630 --> 02:37:08,930
But if you want to unlock this code, it's not time-limited.

3291
02:37:09,110 --> 02:37:11,230
It can be unlocked on any platforms, by the way.

3292
02:37:11,490 --> 02:37:16,330
So if you have a game on console or PC, you can unlock this t-shirt.

3293
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:18,750
And it's not limited, so you can unlock it whenever.

3294
02:37:19,170 --> 02:37:21,350
So a huge thank you to Bandai for the sponsor.

3295
02:37:21,530 --> 02:37:22,630
I will be dropping the code.

3296
02:37:23,730 --> 02:37:25,410
The code is pinned in my chat.

3297
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:28,270
And also it's on my screen right now at the bottom left, as you see.

3298
02:37:28,270 --> 02:37:29,510
You just type the code down.

3299
02:37:30,070 --> 02:37:32,770
Here I am putting in the chat in my own YouTube channel chat.

3300
02:37:33,090 --> 02:37:36,910
So if you guys liked what you saw, if you guys are interested in my channel, I do a lot of variety stuff.

3301
02:37:36,970 --> 02:37:39,450
As well as other FPS games, other shooter-type games.

3302
02:37:39,890 --> 02:37:43,190
You can subscribe to me on YouTube for Doki Bird.

3303
02:37:43,330 --> 02:37:45,130
I'm also on Twitch at Doki Bird.

3304
02:37:46,390 --> 02:37:51,750
And if you guys didn't know, I try to stream almost every day.

3305
02:37:52,470 --> 02:37:54,190
And I do a lot of other stuff too.

3306
02:37:55,130 --> 02:37:58,130
Also if you guys want to know how to unlock this shirt, it's very easy.

3307
02:37:58,130 --> 02:38:00,130
You just go to...

3308
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:04,670
You have to play through the tutorial, by the way, to do this.

3309
02:38:04,850 --> 02:38:08,470
You just go to Other, and then click Serial Code Entry right here.

3310
02:38:08,670 --> 02:38:10,150
And then paste the code right here.

3311
02:38:10,210 --> 02:38:11,210
And then you can unlock it.

3312
02:38:11,410 --> 02:38:15,670
If you want to see the shirt right away, you have to return to the main menu.

3313
02:38:17,030 --> 02:38:17,850
Return to the title.

3314
02:38:18,290 --> 02:38:19,470
And then just log back in.

3315
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:20,210
And then you should get it.

3316
02:38:20,270 --> 02:38:21,910
So like I said, this is an extraction shooter.

3317
02:38:22,330 --> 02:38:25,030
So we did die, and then we lost everything.

3318
02:38:25,450 --> 02:38:26,090
But it's okay.

3319
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:27,870
I stole somebody's...

3320
02:38:27,870 --> 02:38:31,750
I stole somebody's husband and made back all the money.

3321
02:38:31,950 --> 02:38:33,990
So kidnapping is okay in this game.

3322
02:38:34,370 --> 02:38:37,790
I might not have got any legs today, but like I got...

3323
02:38:37,790 --> 02:38:39,050
I got somebody's man.

3324
02:38:40,070 --> 02:38:43,070
I am not a homewrecker, okay?

3325
02:38:43,350 --> 02:38:44,830
I rescued him.

3326
02:38:47,390 --> 02:38:49,390
It was a rescue mission.

3327
02:38:49,810 --> 02:38:51,370
I am not a homewrecker.

3328
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:58,390
Hey guys, huge shoutout to Bandai.

3329
02:38:58,530 --> 02:38:59,490
Thank you again.

3330
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:03,510
Thank you again for sponsoring me.

3331
02:39:03,630 --> 02:39:05,710
I had a great time going through the whole entire journey.

3332
02:39:06,190 --> 02:39:08,930
Uplink, Senuality, Echo Beta.

3333
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:11,530
I think I've done like three playthroughs with them.

3334
02:39:12,050 --> 02:39:14,390
And it's been quite a journey.

3335
02:39:14,630 --> 02:39:15,490
So yes, thank you again.

3336
02:39:15,550 --> 02:39:19,250
And I'm really happy that I got to be part of an actual official Bandai game.

3337
02:39:19,650 --> 02:39:22,270
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

3338
02:39:22,710 --> 02:39:23,230
Posture check.

3339
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:25,170
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3340
02:39:25,170 --> 02:39:28,890
And if you sail for me, head to bed cause you deserve it.

3341
02:39:28,970 --> 02:39:30,410
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3342
02:39:30,910 --> 02:39:31,730
Bye guys.

3343
02:39:32,170 --> 02:39:32,690
Bye.
