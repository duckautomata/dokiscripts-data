1
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,540
Whoa!

2
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,620
Batman!

3
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,940
I'm sorry that... I just... one of my friends linked me the fucking... linked me the tweet.

4
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,640
And I was like, wait, that's actually so good.

5
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,000
I was just like, oh my god, I love that comic.

6
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,020
I love that meme.

7
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,740
I was like, Doki, this is where my parents die.

8
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,560
Whoa!

9
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,600
Batman!

10
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,150
I'm sorry, it was just so good.

11
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,350
It actually was so fun.

12
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,770
That guy, whoever voice acted for Batman, bro, shout out to that guy.

13
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,550
That was actually a really good voice acting for Batman.

14
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,290
That was actually really fucking good.

15
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,450
Jeremy, thank you for the super chat.

16
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,330
Thank you, thank you.

17
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,670
And Mon, thank you for the 20 gifted chips.

18
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,750
Thank you, thank you.

19
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,010
Link, don't worry, it's pinned on my chat.

20
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,150
It's pinned on the chat.

21
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,210
Link to the video.

22
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,830
I love that fucking meme.

23
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,950
Anyway, it's Batman time.

24
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:06,150
For those who are actually new here and never watched a Doki stream before, most likely, 90%, I forgot the majority of the controls.

25
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:17,110
If I'm not playing a game right away, like if I... every time I leave a game for a while and I come back to it, I'm just like, what are the controls?

26
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,690
What do I do?

27
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,310
I think the only thing I can remember is the punching mechanic.

28
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,450
I think I only... where am I?

29
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,570
Where am I?

30
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,690
Okay, this is the...

31
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,130
Alright, punch.

32
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,870
Give me a sec.

33
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,230
Run.

34
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,670
Alright, Batarang.

35
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,690
Uh, dude, it's been three days.

36
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,250
Okay, detective mode.

37
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,590
God, I still like... I really hate the... um...

38
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,150
I do not... what is this?

39
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,490
Crouch.

40
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,850
Okay.

41
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,710
Alright, what is this?

42
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,530
What is RB?

43
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,430
What the fuck is RB?

44
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,830
Okay, RB is throw.

45
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,150
Okay.

46
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,310
Alright, we got this.

47
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,390
We got this.

48
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,390
We're figuring it out.

49
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,670
Very slowly but surely.

50
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,170
Wait.

51
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,990
Oh my gosh, there's so many plays.

52
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,430
Oh, hey!

53
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:02,870
Ridley!

54
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,050
Nice.

55
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,290
Always want more Ridley trophies.

56
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,770
Alright, RB is grapple.

57
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,890
Okay, I got this.

58
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,770
I hate the detective mode because the detect... the...

59
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,690
Sorry, detective mode makes it so that it's harder to like... see what...

60
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,370
Like, the flashes.

61
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,190
I hate the flashes so much.

62
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:22,610
Uh...

63
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,110
Broomstick, thank you for the super chat.

64
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:24,750
Thank you, thank you.

65
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,410
Glad to see you.

66
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,870
So happy to hear you're still good stream.

67
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,450
Thank you!

68
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,350
Thank you for the super chat.

69
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,150
Thank you, thank you.

70
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,570
Pretty sure this is not the right way.

71
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,170
Yeah, it's like the little flashbang.

72
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,370
I really don't like it.

73
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:35,570
Oh.

74
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,590
Alright, time to beat up.

75
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,110
Do I need to be stealthy?

76
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,350
No.

77
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,710
Hey.

78
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,310
Wait, how do I dodge?

79
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,550
Oh, it's okay.

80
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,550
They're just dead.

81
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,850
Alright.

82
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,410
Wait, wait!

83
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,290
No, I forgot how to do the finisher move!

84
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,070
Okay.

85
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,830
Um... Why?

86
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,030
Okay, there we go.

87
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,370
We're fine.

88
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,070
Alright, it's coming back to me.

89
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,090
It's like driving a car.

90
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,570
I haven't drove a car in ten years.

91
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,490
But it's just... it's just like driving a car.

92
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,990
There you go.

93
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,890
It's almost just like driving a car.

94
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,590
Alright.

95
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,190
I don't think I should touch a car for... I don't think...

96
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,150
Condition unconscious.

97
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,750
Oh, I can like see their heart rate.

98
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,450
Alright, nice.

99
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,570
At least they're just unconscious.

100
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,450
Uh... I mean like if I can't kill...

101
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,510
Okay, not gonna lie.

102
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,410
If I can't kill, I feel like legally...

103
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,610
Like in the bat rules, I should be able to use a crowbar.

104
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,590
As long as I don't kill anybody.

105
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,290
Like if I can use the battering rams, I should be able to use them.

106
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:53,270
Because like... I feel like batter... the batterings are like... they're still metal.

107
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,070
Right?

108
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:00,070
So legally, if you think about it, I should be able to also use a crowbar.

109
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,010
Because I'm already giving them brain damage.

110
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,070
Right?

111
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,630
So if I'm giving...

112
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,770
Okay, yes.

113
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,550
For people like...

114
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,930
Batman doesn't kill.

115
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,250
I'm not gonna kill them.

116
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,230
Like... making them paralyzed is not killing.

117
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,150
It's just very cruel.

118
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,450
But they're not gonna die.

119
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,030
Like... they're not going to die.

120
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,310
I'm just shutting... I don't know how to dodge in the middle of kicking ass.

121
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,010
Super thank you for the super chat.

122
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,650
Thank you.

123
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,430
Thank you.

124
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,070
Like, why do you assume I'm gonna aim for the head?

125
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,270
I can... I can...

126
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,750
I can aim for...

127
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,830
Jesus Christ!

128
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,650
Think of the Jason Fats!

129
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,610
He lived!

130
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,810
He's still alive!

131
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,810
You can't say that!

132
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,170
Poetry guys.

133
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,730
He's still alive!

134
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,770
Like, a serious injury.

135
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,910
But like... Batman doesn't care.

136
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,990
He doesn't care if someone's seriously injured.

137
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,210
Let me introduce you to old Josh.

138
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,250
He's a good boy.

139
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,110
I'm talking about you and your people.

140
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,590
Hello.

141
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,830
Hello, turkey.

142
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,610
Are you allowed to eat pizza?

143
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,090
Is that...

144
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,570
Of course I'm allowed to eat pizza.

145
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,130
I fucking eat tomatoes all the time.

146
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,030
Thank you for the super chat.

147
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,390
Thank you.

148
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:23,830
Thank you.

149
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,970
Like, all I'm saying is that...

150
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,770
Look, Batman picks and chooses a lot with his rules.

151
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,750
That's all I'm saying.

152
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,250
Alright, hello.

153
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,930
Oh shit!

154
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,530
Oh shit!

155
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,530
Don't worry, I got you.

156
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,630
I got you!

157
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,910
Oh my god!

158
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,210
It's okay.

159
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,910
But all he uses are bat things.

160
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,770
He can't pick up a weapon without bat in front of the name.

161
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,790
I can literally call this a bat bar!

162
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,170
Thank you for the super chat.

163
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:06,490
Thank you.

164
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,340
I mean, you're still getting air in there.

165
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,300
As long as the gas doesn't...

166
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,500
You really think you can beat the Joker?

167
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,000
I can't even beat the Joker.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,460
Can you control the ventilation system in there?

169
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,280
Drag.

170
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,380
It's a no go.

171
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,000
He disabled remote access.

172
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,600
I'll find a way.

173
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,080
Wait, does he have like a fucking hook for a hand?

174
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,460
Where's your hand, sir?

175
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,780
Wait, that's not even like...

176
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,740
I guess like Arkham Asylum doesn't pay very well.

177
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,500
Because that's not even a prosthetic.

178
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,360
That's literally a hook hand.

179
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,360
Holy shit.

180
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,940
Holy shit.

181
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,980
Where is my...

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,820
Where is my funding going?

183
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,900
I'm fucking...

184
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,800
Where's Wayne?

185
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
Where is my funding going?

186
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,640
I funded like five million dollars to this fucking asylum.

187
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,300
And all you can get is a fucking metal...

188
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,280
That's not even good.

189
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,380
I feel like if you have a metal literally attached...

190
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,780
Like, how does that help you?

191
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,680
It's not even a prosthetic.

192
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,520
You can't even pick anything.

193
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,720
You might as well just have a stump hand.

194
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,540
Like...

195
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,080
Yes.

196
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,140
This is a prison.

197
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,540
You...

198
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,980
Like, I feel like there's no actual use of it.

199
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,380
I'm not even used to that.

200
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,300
Because you can't pick anything.

201
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,580
What are you gonna do?

202
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,480
Make holes or something?

203
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,980
On like pieces of paper?

204
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,120
Like...

205
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
Go put the TV down.

206
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,800
Oh, use it to press buttons on the TV?

207
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,900
Oh yeah, sorry.

208
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,440
All the money went to the TV.

209
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
High on caffeine.

210
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
Thank you for the magenta soup.

211
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,260
Thank you, thank you.

212
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,060
Wait, you eat tomatoes?

213
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,260
Wouldn't that be capitalism?

214
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,780
Someone clearly didn't know my lore.

215
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,720
I don't know.

216
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:00,760
I don't know.

217
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:00,960
I don't know.

218
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I have an entire stream dedicated to eating all my tomato children.

219
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,040
Open the door.

220
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,800
Oh, the door is blocked.

221
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,520
Okay, what do we do?

222
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,500
All right, clearly we don't do anything here.

223
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,760
All right, yeah, the weak should eat the strong.

224
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,160
Exactly.

225
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,760
Now you're speaking my language.

226
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,160
It's called survival of the fittest.

227
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,280
Bruce Wayne has money.

228
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,300
You're Batman.

229
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,940
Right, thank you for the soup.

230
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,040
Super chat, thank you, thank you.

231
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,400
All right, check the map.

232
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:36,880
No!

233
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,380
I'm going to figure this out by pure instinct.

234
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,620
This is called the gamer instinct.

235
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,780
Can I just leave that guy to die?

236
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,840
Does he actually matter?

237
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,440
I'm pretty sure he doesn't matter.

238
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,800
Okay, let's see.

239
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,540
Where do I go?

240
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,740
Where the fuck do I go?

241
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,700
I clearly can't do anything here.

242
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,800
Can I jump?

243
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm gonna jump.

244
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm gonna jump.

245
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,240
Okay, I should not have jumped.

246
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,860
Use detective mode?

247
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,020
No!

248
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,540
Okay, I should use detective mode.

249
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,280
Oh.

250
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,840
Use to remove purify.

251
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,480
Okay, but how do I get there?

252
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,560
Can I just...

253
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,920
Can I just do this?

254
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,040
Okay, no.

255
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,900
What do I do?

256
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,640
Condition 10.

257
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:32,900
I'm terrified.

258
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,940
Can I just kill him?

259
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,240
There you go.

260
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,600
I mean, he's unconscious, so he's still okay.

261
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,210
I can't let this man die.

262
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,310
Well, that's unfortunate then.

263
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,590
He's okay.

264
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,390
I mean, look.

265
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,930
See, he still has a heart rate.

266
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,030
Like...

267
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,130
What's gonna happen to him?

268
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,470
I mean, he's still okay.

269
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,110
That was a big fall.

270
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,690
Look, he's okay!

271
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,910
Look at him.

272
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:14,850
Look.

273
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,730
We can...

274
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,170
Look, see?

275
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,010
It's not even red.

276
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,210
It's like yellow.

277
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,570
Alright.

278
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,330
We gotta figure this out.

279
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:25,690
Okay.

280
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,750
Where the fuck do I...

281
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,050
Let's see.

282
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:31,710
Like, see?

283
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,350
He's unconscious.

284
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,630
Guys, he's not dead.

285
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,650
He's just unconscious.

286
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,830
I can't fucking grapple anywhere.

287
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,530
Where is it?

288
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,390
Where do I go?

289
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,570
I feel like this is not where I should be going.

290
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,850
He's just...

291
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,190
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,610
I'm just gonna leave him.

293
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,510
I feel like we don't have to do anything with this guy.

294
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,410
Glide?

295
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,310
Glide where?

296
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,530
I feel like I can't even...

297
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,190
Okay, let's try.

298
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:08,950
We...

299
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:09,690
Okay.

300
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,530
Don't worry.

301
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:14,950
I'm okay.

302
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,610
I'm okay.

303
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,010
I'm okay.

304
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,670
Let's try this again.

305
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,130
I can...

306
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:20,570
I got this.

307
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,790
I can...

308
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,370
Wait, wait, wait.

309
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,030
I got this.

310
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,030
I have so much HP.

311
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,730
I have so much...

312
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,290
How do I glide again?

313
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,410
There we go.

314
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,870
God damn it!

315
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,510
I'm so...

316
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:38,570
I'm so...

317
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:39,930
Okay.

318
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:40,430
Okay.

319
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,250
I got this.

320
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,510
We...

321
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,810
I'll eventually make it!

322
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,670
It's okay.

323
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,070
I'm alive.

324
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,710
Oh...

325
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,110
Hey...

326
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,870
Someone help Batbaby.

327
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,510
I was...

328
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:56,950
Sorry.

329
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,510
I didn't realize there was a limit to how many times I could do...

330
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:01,930
No!

331
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,270
I have to do this again?

332
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,010
God damn it.

333
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,330
Okay.

334
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,930
I didn't realize.

335
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,490
It's okay.

336
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:08,550
I'm okay.

337
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,130
I wanted to beat him up again anyway.

338
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,170
Alright.

339
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,470
It's alright.

340
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:12,990
It's fine.

341
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,530
It's fine.

342
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,090
Alright.

343
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,830
But he's laughing!

344
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,430
He's clearly having a good time.

345
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,000
Alright.

346
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,960
We'll be fine.

347
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,060
Let's see.

348
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,120
Alright.

349
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,380
If he's laughing, why are you dead?

350
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,880
I tinked out!

351
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,720
Thank you for the super chat!

352
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,060
Thank you!

353
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,520
Thank you!

354
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,680
Yo, Golden Trophy Bird.

355
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,320
Hope you're doing well.

356
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,900
Thank you!

357
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,680
Yeah, I'm doing great.

358
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm fine.

359
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm good to play Batman.

360
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,480
Okay.

361
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,120
Alright.

362
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,540
Here we go.

363
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,280
We can do this again.

364
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,180
Alright.

365
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,460
Don't worry.

366
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,180
You'll be okay.

367
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,080
Yay!

368
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,520
See?

369
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,000
He's fine.

370
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,160
See?

371
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,940
I got XP!

372
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,160
If it's not fine, why did I get XP?

373
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,740
Just think of that.

374
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,740
If...

375
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,000
If...

376
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,520
If it was not fine, why did it give me XP?

377
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,060
Oh my god.

378
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,960
It's right here.

379
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,780
Guys.

380
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,140
Who the fuck said glide?

381
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,600
Who the fuck said glide?

382
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,340
Who said glide?

383
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,080
It was literally right there.

384
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,800
Oh.

385
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,380
Whoops.

386
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,280
Whoops.

387
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:32,840
Sorry.

388
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,140
No!

389
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,540
I thought I fended.

390
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,700
Now glide.

391
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh.

392
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,320
Wait.

393
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,520
Wait.

394
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,140
Is that not...

395
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,340
Did I not fix the gas?

396
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,720
Where else would there be gas?

397
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,420
I thought I fixed it.

398
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,400
Used to remove...

399
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,820
Wait.

400
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,420
Where did I not fix it?

401
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,080
Look.

402
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,400
It's going on.

403
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,420
It lessened?

404
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:02,740
Oh!

405
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,720
Okay.

406
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,540
Glide to...

407
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
Part above the gas.

408
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,000
Okay.

409
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,120
Weeeeee.

410
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,740
Nice.

411
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,220
I did it.

412
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,520
Alright.

413
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,460
Where do I have to go?

414
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,820
See?

415
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,180
It's okay.

416
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,120
Look.

417
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,980
He's still unconscious.

418
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,220
Alright.

419
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,460
Nice.

420
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,280
I'm doing it.

421
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,660
Okay.

422
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,700
There's...

423
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:28,860
Yeah.

424
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,300
There it is.

425
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,880
Oh.

426
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,160
Boop.

427
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,040
There we go.

428
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,940
I'm doing it!

429
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,340
Of course I am.

430
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,840
I'm Batman.

431
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm Batman.

432
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,420
Alright.

433
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,240
Is that everything?

434
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:43,840
Sam!

435
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,680
Thank you for the super chat!

436
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,000
Thank you!

437
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,580
Thank you!

438
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,160
Hey Doki.

439
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,040
I'm the one who invented the wallow swallow thing.

440
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,780
If you have time, I was wondering if you could give a short motivational speech for anybody who is down in the dumps.

441
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,220
Love you platonically.

442
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:56,960
Always...

443
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,620
Always...

444
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,900
Always swallow with the help of me.

445
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,660
Alex, thank you for the gifted ship.

446
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,420
Thank you.

447
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,980
Thank you.

448
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,140
Is that everything?

449
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,040
What else is there?

450
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,820
Oh hey.

451
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,540
Boop.

452
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,080
Wait.

453
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,980
Did I get the xp?

454
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,280
I did.

455
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,820
Nice.

456
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,220
What do I glide?

457
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,260
What else?

458
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,880
Is this still laughing gas?

459
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,740
No, it's not.

460
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,080
Okay.

461
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,540
Boop.

462
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,280
All defense agreed.

463
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,560
We've got full power.

464
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,240
What do you mean?

465
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,240
I literally solved this myself.

466
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,280
You guys said glide.

467
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,760
You guys gave me instructions.

468
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:39,960
It's not the same.

469
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,580
It comes out of order and I figured it out myself.

470
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,680
Nice.

471
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,680
Look at that.

472
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,760
Not the Joker?

473
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,020
I mean, I guess like, cause like the killer croc ate his hand.

474
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,880
I still think that is like the worst prosthetic you can ever get.

475
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,280
Because you can't do anything with that.

476
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,040
Like, it's literally just two hooks.

477
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,660
What can you grab?

478
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,060
I guess like your shirt?

479
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,260
What if you need to like...

480
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,920
Like, it's so useless.

481
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,520
Like, what do you grab?

482
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,740
What?

483
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,060
Oh shit, he's a real person.

484
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,560
In 2003.

485
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,520
Hello.

486
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,220
I saved your life.

487
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,340
You're welcome, guys.

488
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,160
So what's going on?

489
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,860
My radio went dead soon after you brought Joker in.

490
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,460
We lock him up, he gets out and more people die.

491
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,320
If I just have one minute alone with that animal.

492
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,540
A back scratcher.

493
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,800
Who's gonna use this?

494
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,240
Patient's name is Edward Nygma.

495
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,880
What if they use the bathroom?

496
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,020
Thank you for the super chat.

497
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,420
Thank you.

498
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,880
Thank you.

499
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,340
You can talk about your childhood

500
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,220
fascination with the...

501
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,320
To be fair, a lot of villains have like terrible childhoods.

502
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,580
Explain your compulsive behavior.

503
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,940
That's why they hate the world.

504
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,460
Very well.

505
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,220
I was determined to prove him wrong.

506
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,800
So I entered a contest.

507
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,500
A prize to the kid who could figure out an almost impossible...

508
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,240
He was convinced I had cheated.

509
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,940
He kept yelling, you must have cheated.

510
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,780
Admit it, you moron, you cheated.

511
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,120
I swore I did.

512
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:53,700
Whoa.

513
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
And he hit me for lying.

514
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,360
Where's the mom?

515
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,920
I'm sorry to hear that, Edward.

516
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,710
He was right.

517
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,730
Wait, he did cheat?

518
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:03,670
You're a fucking...

519
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,450
You're a fucking cheater?

520
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,210
Oh my God.

521
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,450
I can't believe it, Riddler.

522
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,930
What about integrity?

523
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,850
Astrid, thank you for the gifted ship.

524
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,170
Thank you.

525
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,670
Thank you.

526
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,110
All right, where do I go?

527
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,530
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

528
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,530
I already got a doc.

529
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,610
Oh, we have to get multiple doctors.

530
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,270
I forgot.

531
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,970
It's not just one doctor.

532
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,630
Okay, but is there like anything important here?

533
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,150
At all?

534
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,690
I feel like there was like a vent above here, right?

535
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,070
Wait.

536
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,990
Oh, I can open doors.

537
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:38,790
Hello.

538
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,410
Oh, hey, he's a guy.

539
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,030
See, he's alive.

540
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:42,890
See?

541
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,650
Look at that.

542
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,950
Batman never kills.

543
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,130
Look at that.

544
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,730
I told you I can't kill.

545
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,460
There's a riddle in there.

546
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:57,900
There is?

547
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,140
Wait, where is it?

548
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,780
Is it in here?

549
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,080
Because I can't open that yet.

550
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,040
I think it has to be in there.

551
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,960
It's fine.

552
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,820
We don't need it yet.

553
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,580
I told you.

554
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,500
Just like, you know, permanent damage to the physical body.

555
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,460
But that's okay.

556
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,580
That's what doc.

557
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,140
That's why we're saving the doctors.

558
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,440
That's why.

559
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,980
Oh, it's in the mirror.

560
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,200
Oh shit.

561
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,520
Okay.

562
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,460
Newspaper articles in room with man.

563
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,500
Oh shit.

564
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,500
What was the, what was this firefly too hot?

565
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,200
All right.

566
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,600
Let's see.

567
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,080
All right.

568
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,520
Don't worry.

569
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm not going to do that.

570
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,460
Okay.

571
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,460
This is important, sir.

572
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,540
Okay.

573
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:39,760
Wait.

574
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,160
There you go.

575
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,500
So they're too small.

576
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,600
What else am I supposed to look at?

577
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,000
How is it too small?

578
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,760
Is it because I'm looking at it too hard?

579
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,940
Oh, zoom in.

580
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,400
Okay.

581
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,960
All right.

582
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:00,780
Okay.

583
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,560
Clearly not.

584
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,100
How much more?

585
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,700
How do I zoom?

586
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,000
I have to zoom in.

587
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,900
Oh, okay.

588
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,780
There we go.

589
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,000
Alright, here we go.

590
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,020
I did it!

591
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,940
Firefly escapes Gotham on high alert.

592
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,020
Oh my god, I recently...

593
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,080
YouTube shorts, thank you.

594
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,460
For destroying the comics industry.

595
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,340
I learned about... there's like this villain in Batman called the Calendar Man.

596
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,400
And like, before they retconned him to be like a super serious villain...

597
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,700
He would like kill villains on holidays.

598
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,240
Which, I don't know.

599
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,320
It feels like...

600
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,100
Okay, I... in my opinion...

601
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,140
If the villain, all he does is kill people...

602
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,180
Wait...

603
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,680
Kill people on holidays...

604
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,700
Then like, you know who did it.

605
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,800
Like...

606
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,560
Oh shit, what?

607
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,780
Cause it's like...

608
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,020
Oh my god, somebody died on Christmas.

609
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,940
He was murdered.

610
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,060
Who could it be?

611
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,980
Well, the only person that kills people during the holidays...

612
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,800
Is this one particular villain.

613
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
So it has to be Calendar Man.

614
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,100
Like...

615
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,920
It just feels very...

616
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,220
I don't know.

617
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,060
Like, if you're gonna kill somebody...

618
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,100
I feel like you should...

619
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,860
It should be more random than a fucking holiday.

620
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,860
Nice, thank you for the free stuff.

621
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,060
I actually thought it was gonna be like...

622
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,740
Nice.

623
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,080
Yay!

624
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,060
That's the point.

625
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,680
Some villains like that...

626
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,780
But it's stupid!

627
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,740
Like...

628
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,240
They don't wanna get caught!

629
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,820
So why would you do the one thing that gets you caught?

630
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay, we gotta go for this one.

631
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,560
Why is it yellow?

632
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,240
Okay.

633
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,060
He did more than kill people.

634
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,460
He did a ton of holiday themed crimes.

635
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,360
Then you know who did it!

636
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,820
Monster, thank you for this super chat.

637
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,900
Thank you, thank you.

638
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,300
It doesn't matter!

639
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,720
It's still on a holiday!

640
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,760
They wanna get caught?

641
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,060
The rehabilitation doesn't work, Batman!

642
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,800
He's encouraging... Oh, is this Saw?

643
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,900
Just not for me.

644
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,940
It's true!

645
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,880
You really are the world's greatest detective!

646
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,620
It's not even a puzzle.

647
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,610
The hell?

648
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,190
Get down there, boys!

649
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,010
It's a trap!

650
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,130
Oh yeah, really?

651
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,910
Who would've thought this was a trap all along?

652
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,170
Oh my god!

653
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,490
He's alone in there by himself!

654
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,770
What could happen?

655
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,810
Wow, okay.

656
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,510
Hey man.

657
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,450
I'm trying to do a combo move right now.

658
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,310
Excuse me, why are you disturbing my combo?

659
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,150
Oh shit, no!

660
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,030
Come on!

661
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,010
Let me beat him up!

662
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,630
Let me give your friend brain damage!

663
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,670
Nice.

664
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,450
Come on.

665
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,010
Let me punch you in the dick!

666
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,890
Come on, you know you want to!

667
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,410
Okay, nice.

668
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,330
Easy.

669
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:29,810
Excuses.

670
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,270
Yay!

671
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,050
You're too full of yourself, Bats.

672
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,870
I'm just softening you up.

673
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,950
Think of this as a preview to the main event.

674
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,290
You'll see.

675
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,090
What's up here?

676
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,490
I'll free you later.

677
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,190
Sorry, this is important.

678
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,270
Counter button?

679
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,930
What do you mean?

680
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,750
I counted so much!

681
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,850
Okay, Arkham Knight Shift.

682
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,770
Dr. T.

683
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,150
Elliot.

684
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,450
Dr. P. Young.

685
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,390
Dr. ... Wait!

686
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,570
Time.

687
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,810
Week 1, Week 2.

688
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,470
Wait, there's only one doctor per week?

689
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:01,970
Week 2 for night shift?

690
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,920
Killer Croc Transfer?

691
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,140
Week 2?

692
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:09,640
Nurses?

693
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,280
That is not a lot of nurses.

694
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,240
For like, an asylum...

695
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,460
Because the asylum is filled with like, crazy people...

696
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,900
Because that's what an asylum is for.

697
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,040
I feel like 9 nurses...

698
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,100
That is...

699
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,700
That is definitely understaffed.

700
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,220
That is definitely understaffed...

701
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,740
I'll have solved all the puzzles by now.

702
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,160
Yeah, this feels incredibly understaffed.

703
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:37,700
Hush.

704
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,900
Oh, that's the crazy guard!

705
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,180
Right?

706
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,880
Oh no, it wasn't the guard.

707
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,220
Okay, this is a different person.

708
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,460
I know there was a Batman movie about this.

709
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,840
I just realized how many like...

710
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,880
There was like... Did you know they made a movie about Soviet...

711
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,840
Soviet Superman and Batman?

712
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,440
And I was like, what the fuck?

713
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,880
There are so many different types of DC movies.

714
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:29,500
Yeah, called the Red... It's like, what if Superman didn't land in America and landed in fucking Russia?

715
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,420
And I was like, holy fuck.

716
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,740
Yeah.

717
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,100
And then like, Russian Batman kills everybody.

718
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,900
Like, I was just like, holy shit!

719
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,580
Russian Batman does not give a fuck!

720
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,760
He murders everyone!

721
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,500
Um...

722
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,660
Uh...

723
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,780
Anyway...

724
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,320
Coolera, thank you for the superchat.

725
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,180
Thank you, thank you.

726
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,420
It's the freaking bat.

727
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:53,740
Yeah.

728
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,060
Yeah, Russian... Russian Batman kills everyone.

729
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,040
And then Lex Luthor becomes fucking president of the United States of America.

730
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,560
Okay.

731
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:02,680
Okay.

732
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,840
A childhood sociopath.

733
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,200
When his plans failed, partly due to the surgical skills of Thomas Wayne, Bruce's father, Elliot Blaine Bruce.

734
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:18,340
An incredibly skilled surgeon as an adult, Elliot planned an elaborate revenge scheme on Batman.

735
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:25,540
He disguised himself as the villain Hush, his face covered in bandages, but was in the end defeated and unmasked by the Dark Knight.

736
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,920
Hush still plots revenge against Batman, generating complicated schemes with surgical precision.

737
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,900
Wait, so he's just Batman with too much money?

738
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,960
So he's literally just Bruce Wayne with a lot of fucking money.

739
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,060
That's cool.

740
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,160
But instead he's evil.

741
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:51,800
But if he's like, okay, all I'm saying is that, like, okay, Batman, he runs a company that develops weapons.

742
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,760
Tommy Elliot is just a surgeon.

743
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,020
Hahahaha!

744
00:29:59,380 --> 00:29:59,980
Hahahaha!

745
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,560
Where is he?

746
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,800
How is he?

747
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,040
I don't know how you can compare to, like, anything else.

748
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,400
He's literally just a surgeon.

749
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,380
Like, how is he getting his weapon?

750
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,460
He has guns.

751
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,620
Yes, but clearly they're not great weapons.

752
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,580
He's literally just a surgeon.

753
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:28,820
Batman at least has a fucking, like, what is it, Fortune 500 company that specifically develops weapons and armor.

754
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,200
Um...

755
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,700
Great physical strength.

756
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,100
Augmented by a hatred of Bruce Wayne.

757
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,720
World-class surgeon.

758
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,060
Capable of extraordinary medical breakthroughs.

759
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,120
Master of disguise.

760
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,580
But... how?

761
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,800
How is he a master of disguise?

762
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,480
He's just... he just has...

763
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,420
It's still gonna be the same body!

764
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,080
Hahahaha!

765
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,620
I have so many questions about this one character.

766
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,140
I don't... extreme...

767
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,940
He's just so hateful.

768
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,880
He changes his face?

769
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,240
But he still has the same body type!

770
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:11,960
Whoa.

771
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,380
Don't you need to be, like, have anesthesia for...

772
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,020
For, like, any type of surgery?

773
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,740
Holy shit.

774
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,780
There's no way.

775
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,360
Okay.

776
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,100
Alright.

777
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,680
I know, like, we keep...

778
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,120
We keep interrupting this game.

779
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,240
We keep interrupting this game play with, like, fun facts.

780
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,420
But, like...

781
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,380
Eventually, by the time...

782
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,200
If you keep fucking giving yourself plastic surgery...

783
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,060
There's, like, nothing left to fix.

784
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,000
Hahahaha!

785
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,840
There is!

786
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,260
Hahahaha!

787
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,360
Because, like...

788
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,160
At that...

789
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,580
Are you okay?

790
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,620
Also, are you okay, Dr. Adrian Chen?

791
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,660
Like...

792
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,080
You are mentally not okay.

793
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,120
Um...

794
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,880
But, like...

795
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,080
The more plastic surgery you get...

796
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,440
The more fucked up your face is gonna get.

797
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,260
Um...

798
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,120
Anyway...

799
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,220
Um...

800
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,840
Not so Deadpool.

801
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,440
American Batman's parents were killed.

802
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,280
Soviet Batman had...

803
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,300
Oh my god.

804
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,000
They tortured me.

805
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,420
Set me as bait.

806
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,620
I'm sorry.

807
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,960
Are you okay?

808
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
I think I will be okay.

809
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,280
Thank you for stopping them.

810
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,300
How did they torture you?

811
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,080
Oh my god.

812
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,940
They're syringes.

813
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,720
Are you okay?

814
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,180
How much...

815
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,100
How many, like...

816
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,460
Meds did they put in you?

817
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,520
They tortured me.

818
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,780
Set me as bait.

819
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,000
I don't think he's gonna be okay.

820
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,600
I'm sorry.

821
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,440
Can I go through here?

822
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,760
I don't think I can.

823
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,880
How do I deactivate this?

824
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,280
Alright.

825
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,620
Good night.

826
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,080
Thank you for this super chat.

827
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,580
Thank you.

828
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,220
Thank you.

829
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,380
Doki Hush's body type is just a large white man.

830
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,420
Do you have any idea how many of those are in the DC universe?

831
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,760
I'm sorry.

832
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,160
Okay.

833
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:58,820
Oh my god.

834
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,880
You got me there.

835
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,260
It's true.

836
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,320
You got...

837
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,680
You got me there.

838
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,140
Do you want to get a present?

839
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,120
Yay!

840
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,600
Yay!

841
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,200
More XP.

842
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,560
Let's go.

843
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,220
Alright, let's see.

844
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,360
Where's the last one?

845
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,040
The last one is all the way over here.

846
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,360
Okay.

847
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,080
Okay, nice.

848
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,260
Alright, I figured it out.

849
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,280
It's this way.

850
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,200
Presence!

851
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,270
There's a lot of meds.

852
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,750
Oh, that's a lot of shotgun bullets.

853
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,070
Oh, where do I go?

854
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,410
Okay, this way.

855
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:42,650
Oops!

856
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,090
Sometimes the map is really difficult to navigate.

857
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,710
Hello!

858
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:57,830
Hello!

859
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,030
I swear, everybody in the DC Universe is jacked as fuck.

860
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,150
Everyone has a 20-year membership in...

861
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,890
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

862
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,010
Really, Joker?

863
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,050
Is this the best people you can send?

864
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,550
Woop!

865
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,250
There you go.

866
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,210
Nice.

867
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,130
I love just pressing A.

868
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,890
I mean X.

869
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,950
Look down!

870
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,050
I had to look down my controller there.

871
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,530
It's all just...

872
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,390
There is a problem in there, in the Gotham water supply.

873
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,750
Whoa.

874
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,350
Oh shit, that's a lot of people.

875
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,350
Wait!

876
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,070
I'm gonna tag this wall.

877
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,110
No.

878
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,810
How do I tag the wall?

879
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,830
How do I, how do I do it?

880
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,070
Oh, there it is.

881
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:09,970
Yeah!

882
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,930
I did it.

883
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,270
Wait.

884
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,450
Wait, there was an innocent person over there?

885
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,370
No.

886
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:40,190
I didn't realize there was an innocent person there.

887
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,650
I didn't.

888
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,170
Alright, don't worry.

889
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,190
Okay, I didn't realize...

890
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,350
Okay, look.

891
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:04,710
I didn't realize that, you know, there were important people here.

892
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,890
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

893
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,450
Oh hey, they're really listening.

894
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,210
I thought like they were just having a nice conversation.

895
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,990
Like, together.

896
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,250
How is there more than one wall?

897
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,030
Don't worry, it's not legal.

898
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,930
Okay, I'm not killing civilians.

899
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,910
They're the ones killing civilians.

900
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,470
I'm just here to have a good time.

901
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,810
What the fuck?

902
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,050
Oh, okay, there's the other wall.

903
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,930
Alright, I'm gonna tag this wall, I guess.

904
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:49,950
Alright.

905
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,230
I fucked up.

906
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,590
I fucked up.

907
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:53,910
No.

908
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:54,710
No.

909
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,430
No.

910
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,290
No!

911
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,890
Let me finish tagging!

912
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,510
I pressed the wrong one!

913
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,110
I pressed...

914
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,770
I'm sorry, I can't read!

915
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,470
I pressed R, B!

916
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,390
I was like, hold R, T.

917
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,870
Oh, hold R, B.

918
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,110
Hold R, B.

919
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:23,990
Alright.

920
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,810
Okay, I figured it out.

921
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,270
Guys, this time...

922
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,810
This time it's different.

923
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,090
This time it's different.

924
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,190
Okay.

925
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,730
Alright.

926
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,270
R, T.

927
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,670
There we go.

928
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,770
Guys, I don't use controller very often.

929
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,530
Guys, is it noticeable that I don't use controller?

930
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,470
And...

931
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,350
Dr. Young!

932
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,990
First try!

933
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,150
Let's go!

934
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,570
Dr. Young!

935
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,490
First try.

936
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:08,050
You definitely did not die two times before I saved you.

937
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,730
Unfortunately, yes.

938
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,990
But not for long.

939
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,690
I'm very confident in my job.

940
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,010
The warden was very specific.

941
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,090
He wanted Joker cured.

942
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,070
Bad publicity will affect his campaign for mayor.

943
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,790
That'll be the least of it.

944
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:24,790
God.

945
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,170
I almost forgot.

946
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,730
They said they were moving through the facility.

947
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,490
Hunting down the other doctors.

948
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,090
Oh, do not worry, Penny Young.

949
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,810
You were the last one I saved.

950
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,030
Don't worry, doctor.

951
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,530
All the medical staff are safe.

952
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,630
Yeah, all of them are safe now.

953
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,530
They're all...

954
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,130
You were...

955
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,250
You were the last one.

956
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,770
All right.

957
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,890
Let's see.

958
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,770
I want to make sure I...

959
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,230
Make sure I didn't miss anything here.

960
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,810
Let's see...

961
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,770
Is there anything... Is there anything I'm missing?

962
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,230
JP, thank you for the super chat!

963
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,310
Thank you, thank you!

964
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,150
I didn't fuck up, guys!

965
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,550
I didn't fuck up!

966
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,510
I made a slight miscalculation.

967
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,750
And no lies were injured in the process.

968
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:16,510
Okay?

969
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:21,550
As the greatest detective in the world, it was just a little oopsie.

970
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,470
That can be... It's fixable.

971
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,910
Where's the last present?

972
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:28,610
Hello!

973
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,240
I'm so calm.

974
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,480
I'm so calm.

975
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,260
Alright, nice.

976
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:54,860
See?

977
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,800
I told you!

978
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,640
I told you!

979
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,040
Told you I'm calm!

980
00:39:59,500 --> 00:39:59,940
Nice!

981
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,140
Oh wait, I should put back the battery right now so I can...

982
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,400
Nice.

983
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,580
Boop!

984
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:07,780
Boop!

985
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,940
Fucking popped out like Marilyn Monroe there.

986
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,540
Don't keep me messed up!

987
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,860
Thank you for the super chat!

988
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,640
Thank you, thank you!

989
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,480
Alright, where do I go?

990
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,240
Uh... Oh, I gotta go back.

991
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,080
I was so calm.

992
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,900
What do you mean?

993
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,200
I beat the shit out of him.

994
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
There's a children's area?

995
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:42,260
There's fucking super villains and we put a children's area in the asylum?

996
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,000
What the fuck is wrong with Gotham?

997
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,900
What?

998
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,480
Evil kids.

999
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,960
Bro!

1000
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,260
Bro!

1001
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,700
Why is there a children's area?

1002
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,800
There's a mansion?

1003
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,880
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1004
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,540
Thank you, thank you.

1005
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,860
I think she's beginning to figure out the problem where I come to the asylum.

1006
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,480
There's like... This is not even like a problem.

1007
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,660
This is like...

1008
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,000
This is a mistake.

1009
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:34,900
Alright,

1010
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,620
don't worry.

1011
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,200
We got... Oh shit, they have guns.

1012
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,220
Okay, that's not good.

1013
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,580
Okay, they have guns now.

1014
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,940
Alright, let's see.

1015
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,080
Oh fuck.

1016
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,940
They have shotguns.

1017
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,580
Wait a minute.

1018
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,880
Oh wait, I wanna grab these.

1019
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,400
Okay.

1020
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,960
Maybe if I do that and I grapple here.

1021
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,840
And then...

1022
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,540
Alright, wait, where are they?

1023
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,880
Where the fuck are they?

1024
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,980
Where are they going?

1025
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,240
Okay, they're going here.

1026
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:12,700
Okay.

1027
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,420
Let me head to the gargoyle.

1028
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,320
And then...

1029
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,700
Come over here.

1030
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,980
Come over here.

1031
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,140
Come on!

1032
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,820
Come over here.

1033
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,740
Come on!

1034
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,700
How the fuck am I supposed to get you over here?

1035
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,860
No... No Batman.

1036
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,500
Oh shit!

1037
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:33,880
Okay.

1038
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,300
Use detective mode?

1039
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,120
Why do I need to use detective mode?

1040
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,300
I need them to like come over to me.

1041
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,920
Wait, the floor is breakable?

1042
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,860
The floor is breakable?

1043
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,520
No it's not.

1044
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,220
Oh yeah it is.

1045
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,880
Oh shit, you're right!

1046
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:55,840
Okay.

1047
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,960
The structural weakness critter.

1048
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,140
Why is there structural weakness?

1049
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,760
Did no one fucking do anything to this critter?

1050
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,980
All I'm saying is...

1051
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,660
Why the fuck is there structural weakness in it?

1052
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,640
Okay.

1053
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,460
Alright.

1054
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,220
This whole entire area is fucked man.

1055
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,780
Can I just land there and...

1056
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,420
Okay, wait.

1057
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,400
And then...

1058
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:30,940
Pew!

1059
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,860
Tagging it real fast.

1060
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,940
You know why.

1061
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:44,340
Every time I learn more about how poorly this place is built, I'm still surprised and I don't know why.

1062
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:49,180
I should stop being surprised about how terrible this place is.

1063
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,860
Hello?

1064
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,740
Hello?

1065
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,500
Come over here.

1066
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,780
Come on!

1067
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,340
I have the wall!

1068
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,280
Over here!

1069
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,280
Come on!

1070
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,820
Get over here!

1071
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,440
Come on!

1072
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,100
Are you fucking kidding me?

1073
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:13,980
Yeah.

1074
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,460
Yeah.

1075
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:14,640
Yeah, I did.

1076
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,300
Don't look up.

1077
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,500
No?

1078
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:19,960
No?

1079
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,580
Yeah, come over there.

1080
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:25,900
Yeah.

1081
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1082
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1083
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:30,380
Yeah.

1084
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,120
Wait, where are they?

1085
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,280
Where are they going?

1086
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,240
You know, I might as well just kill this guy.

1087
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,160
You know, fuck it.

1088
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:39,940
Oh shit!

1089
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,120
No!

1090
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,860
Oh wait, nice.

1091
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,160
He's unconscious!

1092
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,340
Okay, I'll take that.

1093
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,180
I'll take that actually.

1094
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,280
Okay, nice.

1095
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,560
Alright.

1096
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,300
Okay, I'm just making it much more complicated than it should be.

1097
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,960
Wait, wait, wait.

1098
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,420
Yes!

1099
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:07,860
No!

1100
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,140
Get over here!

1101
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:12,370
No!

1102
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,090
Okay, I fucked up.

1103
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,050
I thought he...

1104
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,550
I thought he was gonna get closer to me.

1105
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,250
Yes!

1106
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:23,770
Yes!

1107
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:24,390
Nice!

1108
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,470
Alright.

1109
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,090
I failed successfully.

1110
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,810
And then glad kick.

1111
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,450
Yay!

1112
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:34,390
Easy.

1113
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,850
But uh...

1114
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,070
Failed successfully.

1115
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,730
I told you guys I can do this.

1116
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,910
Alright, where am I supposed to go now?

1117
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,650
Can I actually upgrade my stuff?

1118
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,670
No, I don't have enough.

1119
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,110
But, dookie, Batman does have guns.

1120
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,650
Two incredibly well-toned guns.

1121
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1122
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,070
Thank you, thank you.

1123
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,430
Uh, poetry guys.

1124
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:04,170
Alright.

1125
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,650
Backseat time.

1126
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:06,670
What do I upgrade?

1127
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:07,890
What's important?

1128
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,510
I don't know.

1129
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,570
What is important, guys?

1130
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:13,830
Extreme violence.

1131
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:15,570
Alright.

1132
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,250
What is important, guys?

1133
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,070
HP?

1134
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:21,770
Throw?

1135
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:22,610
Health?

1136
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,650
Okay, health.

1137
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:24,950
Alright, here.

1138
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,390
Nice.

1139
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:27,610
Martha!

1140
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,130
Alright, nice, alright.

1141
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:30,990
HP time.

1142
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,290
Okay, where do I go?

1143
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,430
Do I still have to go here?

1144
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,350
Return to the doctors and pick up Gordon's...

1145
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:38,630
uh...

1146
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,410
tobacco trail.

1147
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:39,770
Okay.

1148
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:41,990
Alright, I gotta figure this out.

1149
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,690
Is it like...

1150
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,450
here?

1151
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:45,310
No?

1152
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,830
Okay, wrong way.

1153
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,670
Wrong way.

1154
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,730
I'll forever be lost in this hellhole.

1155
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,390
Oh my god.

1156
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,210
Okay, this way.

1157
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:58,830
Up I go.

1158
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:05,570
Cool, man.

1159
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,510
Thank you for the super chat.

1160
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,230
Thank you, thank you.

1161
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:07,470
Oh!

1162
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,130
Do it!

1163
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,010
Do it!

1164
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:17,370
No pause!

1165
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:25,710
Joker would never do it because like, he gets his kicks going by having Batman as like an archenemy.

1166
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,790
Got a few more surprises in store for you.

1167
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,490
Prepare to face your fears.

1168
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:38,970
His greatest fear is like, losing Batman and then becoming an office worker.

1169
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:40,750
Nice.

1170
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,440
Holy scarecrow.

1171
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,240
Wait, what?

1172
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,020
Wait, scarecrow?

1173
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,260
What the fuck is scarecrow?

1174
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:13,430
Oh, Sean.

1175
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,250
Are you gonna take your hat off to Harley bats?

1176
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,490
Wait, is it gonna become a horror story?

1177
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,090
Is it gonna come out last?

1178
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,810
What is Batman scared of?

1179
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:33,810
Riddles!

1180
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,650
I'm scared of not getting that riddle trophy.

1181
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,150
Haha!

1182
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,400
Haha!

1183
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,220
Joker, no matter what, there is one fangirl out there that would love to see you in a thong.

1184
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,260
I.E.

1185
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,600
Harley.

1186
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,020
Tax is my number one fear.

1187
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,260
Okay, let's see.

1188
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,400
Oh, wait, what?

1189
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,540
I just...

1190
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,380
Developed by Wendy's control points are considered hack-proof.

1191
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,940
That is such a fucking lie!

1192
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,000
Why does it keep telling me it's hack-proof?

1193
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,100
It is not hack-proof!

1194
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,380
Even Joker can fucking hack into this.

1195
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,180
Okay, let's put this on.

1196
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,540
Hanging this.

1197
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,940
Nice.

1198
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,220
Okay.

1199
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,400
What every billionaire's fear of Texas.

1200
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,960
Yeah, I feel like Batman has multiple offshore accounts.

1201
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,340
Gordon?

1202
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,640
Gordon!

1203
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,820
Watch it.

1204
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,680
Thank you for the super chat.

1205
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,020
Thank you.

1206
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:45,540
Thank you.

1207
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,020
Oh, yeah, it is canon.

1208
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,020
His biggest fear is the IRS.

1209
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,040
I forgot about that.

1210
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,650
Oh.

1211
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,480
All right, let's go.

1212
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,140
Let me in.

1213
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,800
Let me in.

1214
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:10,900
Let me in!

1215
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:14,820
Gordon?

1216
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,380
Gordon, you okay?

1217
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,140
Hey.

1218
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:19,980
Gordon?

1219
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,820
Gordon?

1220
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,300
Gordon, look at me.

1221
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,220
You got a blink or your eyes are gonna dry out.

1222
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,860
I'm sorry, Jim.

1223
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,880
Wait, is he dead?

1224
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,500
What?

1225
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,640
They just killed off Jim Gordon?

1226
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:39,880
Wait, no.

1227
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,960
I have to be having a nightmare right now.

1228
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,260
There's no fucking way Jim Gordon just dies like that.

1229
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,000
There is no way.

1230
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,000
This has to be a nightmare.

1231
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,360
Batman, wake up!

1232
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:56,720
You there.

1233
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,300
Please hang up your phone.

1234
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,030
Hunt down Commissioner Gordon.

1235
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,850
There's no fucking way.

1236
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,490
There's no way.

1237
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,530
There's no way they just kill him like that.

1238
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,150
I must be dreaming.

1239
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:14,510
I must be having a nightmare from the scarecrow.

1240
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,570
Yeah, this is definitely a nightmare.

1241
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:17,870
Okay, look.

1242
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:21,330
Look, this place sucks, but it doesn't suck that much.

1243
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,400
The morgue.

1244
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:29,860
Oh, shit.

1245
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,240
People are gonna come alive, aren't they?

1246
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,420
I don't like this.

1247
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,600
Oh.

1248
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,660
Oh.

1249
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,360
Oh.

1250
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,820
I am not a fan of this.

1251
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,580
I am not a fan.

1252
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,380
When did this become Outlast?

1253
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:53,840
Wait,

1254
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:58,910
this is the morgue.

1255
00:51:58,910 --> 00:51:59,770
Where are the dead bodies?

1256
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:02,370
Hello?

1257
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,070
Hello?

1258
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,850
How do I get out?

1259
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:09,370
How do I?

1260
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:09,590
I don't know.

1261
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:11,090
How do I get out?

1262
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:12,830
I don't know how!

1263
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,780
Do I just...

1264
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,080
I'm thinking!

1265
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,660
You can't keep saying get out of here.

1266
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,460
You don't tell me how!

1267
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,540
The voices.

1268
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,740
The voices.

1269
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,620
They're getting louder.

1270
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,200
Okay, fine.

1271
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:40,620
Fine.

1272
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:40,920
Fine!

1273
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,240
Oh, shit.

1274
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,340
Oh, hey.

1275
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,900
Oh, he did want me to get out of here.

1276
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:47,620
Okay.

1277
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:47,960
Oh, shit.

1278
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,100
Wait.

1279
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,220
Wait.

1280
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,580
Are you telling me I should have got out of there?

1281
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,200
No way.

1282
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,160
Dad?

1283
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,080
This is where my parents died.

1284
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,600
No way.

1285
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:08,350
Mom?

1286
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,030
Turns out it was dad.

1287
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:13,910
You see?

1288
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:15,970
I should have got out of there.

1289
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:20,910
Jesus Christ.

1290
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:21,770
Trauma.

1291
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,910
Is this going to be long?

1292
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:23,030
Is this going to be me?

1293
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:25,210
Bruce?

1294
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:28,250
Oh, scarecrow.

1295
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,670
The voices told me to...

1296
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:40,130
Whoa!

1297
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,770
Well, I actually got goosebumps from that.

1298
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:44,850
That's so fucking cool.

1299
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,990
Oh, I don't have detective mode.

1300
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:48,190
No.

1301
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:48,610
No!

1302
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,610
He took away the one thing I have!

1303
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,390
I'm the world's greatest detective, but I can't get into detective mode!

1304
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,350
Stephen, thank you for the super chat.

1305
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:02,750
Thank you.

1306
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,310
Thank you.

1307
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,650
The voices told you to get...

1308
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:05,670
I like how they were like, get out of there.

1309
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:05,890
I was like...

1310
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:06,990
What do I do, chat?

1311
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,270
I don't understand!

1312
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,350
Oh, shit.

1313
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,910
Giant scarecrow.

1314
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,050
Oh, my little bat.

1315
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,490
You're in my world now!

1316
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,510
Put a shirt on.

1317
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,330
Oh, shit.

1318
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:36,490
I'm dead.

1319
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:38,370
Ow.

1320
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:40,690
Wait, what do I do?

1321
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,030
I just run?

1322
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,590
I'm just gonna run.

1323
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,570
Okay.

1324
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:48,790
Where...

1325
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:52,940
Haha!

1326
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:54,400
Okay.

1327
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,880
Okay, I gotta go up.

1328
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,280
I'm just gonna wait.

1329
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,320
Alright.

1330
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,340
Does this scan me?

1331
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:10,760
Nice.

1332
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,480
Okay, that does it.

1333
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,520
Alright.

1334
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,040
Where do I go?

1335
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,420
Where do I go?

1336
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,820
Do I... what?

1337
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:20,880
Huh?

1338
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,180
What happened?

1339
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:23,840
Wait.

1340
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,880
Is this the... this has to be the...

1341
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,660
Just punch the wall, scarecrow!

1342
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,040
Okay.

1343
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,780
Oh my god.

1344
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,160
Please!

1345
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,000
Tag faster!

1346
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,280
Please tag faster!

1347
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:34,960
Oh shit!

1348
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:35,460
Okay!

1349
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,920
Oh shit!

1350
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,720
He got so fast!

1351
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,800
Dude, this trip is crazy!

1352
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,440
Thank you for the super chat!

1353
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,000
Thank you!

1354
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,480
Okay, how the fuck was I supposed to know he was gonna go faster?

1355
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,320
Alright.

1356
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,400
Alright, nice.

1357
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:01,640
Okay.

1358
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,440
Just gotta run.

1359
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,000
Just gotta run.

1360
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,520
Just gotta run.

1361
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,020
Just gotta run.

1362
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,940
And then crouch.

1363
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,000
Alright.

1364
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,340
If he really wanted to kill me, he could just punch the wall.

1365
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,040
It's not that hard.

1366
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,200
Crouch, crouch, crouch, crouch, crouch!

1367
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,300
Alright, nice.

1368
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:27,460
Alright.

1369
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,480
Okay, we gotta bring out...

1370
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,200
I wish he could tag things faster, but he still needs to draw the bat signal on everything.

1371
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,540
Alright.

1372
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,220
Please, please, please, Batman!

1373
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:37,800
Please!

1374
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,900
It's not that quick!

1375
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,200
It's not that quick!

1376
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:43,680
Nice.

1377
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,780
I'm not here.

1378
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,880
Where could I be?

1379
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:51,900
Whoa!

1380
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,760
I wonder where I could be right about now!

1381
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,100
Whoa!

1382
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,020
Whoa!

1383
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,180
Okay.

1384
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,800
Nice.

1385
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,800
There's no way he's gonna look past this wall, right?

1386
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,720
There's no fucking way.

1387
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,320
There's no fucking way.

1388
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,120
Okay, I don't know his pattern right now, so I'm like, scared.

1389
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,640
I'm actually scared.

1390
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,580
Okay.

1391
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,140
Nice.

1392
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,920
I swear, if he like fucking looks back as like a little gotcha moment...

1393
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:28,470
What was that?

1394
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,010
My biggest fear!

1395
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,070
Light!

1396
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,820
That's fucking right!

1397
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,380
Get flash banged!

1398
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:44,380
What silent killer of the oceans can be found in a tiny jar?

1399
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,020
What?

1400
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,300
Cat?

1401
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:47,720
Wait.

1402
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:48,320
What?

1403
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,400
Alright.

1404
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,400
Character bio.

1405
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,840
Where is he?

1406
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:52,540
Is that him?

1407
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,220
The scarecrow?

1408
00:57:53,960 --> 00:58:00,940
Taunted and bullied as a youth, Jonathan Crane vowed to overcome his fear through the study of psychology and biochemistry.

1409
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:13,780
Kicked out of his university for experimenting on human subjects, Crane then adopted the identity of the scarecrow and armed himself with specialized fear-inducing gas that makes the person's deepest phobias become frightening and frighteningly real.

1410
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:19,480
His ongoing criminal reign of terror makes him one of Batman's most psychologically dangerous foes.

1411
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,920
Stupid Crane.

1412
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:26,680
You have to go through animals and then experiment on humans.

1413
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,960
Because apparently that's how ethical... apparently that's more ethical.

1414
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,100
You can experiment on humans all you want!

1415
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,800
You just gotta follow the process!

1416
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,080
Alright, let's see.

1417
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,780
Professional... what the fuck?

1418
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,520
Occupation.

1419
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,040
Professional criminal.

1420
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,480
That's his job.

1421
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,320
Alright.

1422
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:00,960
He just needs to follow the process and then he can experiment on as many humans as he wants.

1423
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,580
Welcome to science.

1424
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,130
The jar.

1425
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:14,950
Oh, there's the jar.

1426
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:16,310
There it is.

1427
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:17,770
What is that?

1428
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:18,590
Is that a finger?

1429
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:20,850
Oh shit, no.

1430
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:21,990
Not my explosive jar.

1431
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,710
Subject too small?

1432
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:25,750
Do I have to fucking scan this?

1433
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:26,390
Okay.

1434
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:27,810
Alright.

1435
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,050
What the fuck is that?

1436
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:36,590
What is that?

1437
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:37,290
Oops, sorry.

1438
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,490
The great white shark.

1439
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:43,270
A crooked financer who stole millions of dollars.

1440
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:48,230
Warren Wright thought he'd scored a legal victory when his insanity pili went through.

1441
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,010
But when he got to... I actually don't know this criminal.

1442
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:53,990
But when he got to Arkham Asylum, he realized his mistake.

1443
00:59:54,270 --> 01:00:01,930
Driven insane by the other inmates, he was also disfigured by an encounter with Mr. Freeze that left him without hair... Oh my god, it's Voldemort!

1444
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:04,510
A nose, ears, or lips.

1445
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,070
Calling himself the great white shark.

1446
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:13,670
He filed his teeth into fangs to more perfectly resemble his new namesake.

1447
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:20,270
Putting the financial skills to use, he has become a major player in Gotham's underground crime scene.

1448
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:26,710
Running a number of rackets from his... Oh, so he's like the... the accountant for like, criminals.

1449
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:33,150
He's like the main accountant!

1450
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:34,270
Warren White!

1451
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,130
The underrated villain.

1452
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:38,390
I mean...

1453
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,390
I mean, he's an accountant!

1454
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,610
So...

1455
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,850
Like, wow!

1456
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:45,910
I'm so scared.

1457
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:49,570
What she uses for her variety of criminal purposes.

1458
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,330
Scarred visage that makes him resemble a shark.

1459
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:53,370
Thief sharpened...

1460
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:55,370
Like, I'm just saying...

1461
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:59,570
He's... He's just... He's an accountant.

1462
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,930
He's not like, an actual villain.

1463
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:05,390
He's just there to help the villains do their taxes.

1464
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:12,700
Cause like, I assume the villains can't have like regular accountants, right?

1465
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:18,600
So like, obviously it makes sense that, like, they have to get a villain accountant.

1466
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,340
Also, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1467
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,040
I'll be right back.

1468
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:30,650
I'm back, guys!

1469
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:36,570
Okay, the best part about like, playing on controller is that I can actually...

1470
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,230
I can actually just...

1471
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:39,730
I'm like lounging on my chair.

1472
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,110
While playing this game.

1473
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,310
Thanks for the super chat.

1474
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:47,130
Thank you, thank you.

1475
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,090
Are your eyes green or gray?

1476
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:50,110
Um, it's green.

1477
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:54,690
If it's sometimes gray, it's because I accidentally have the green screen on.

1478
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:00,210
That's the only reason why sometimes it's gray.

1479
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,090
Okay, oh hey.

1480
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,730
What's the... Why is there arrow signs?

1481
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,530
Am I that stupid?

1482
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:08,230
I need...

1483
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:11,990
Is Batman and Batman actually challenged that the game was like...

1484
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,510
I knew it!

1485
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:15,250
Knew it!

1486
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:17,110
There's no way they would just kill Gordon!

1487
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:18,910
That fast!

1488
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,450
Same here.

1489
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,690
Just roll with the dots.

1490
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:33,030
It gets easier once you get in.

1491
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:34,550
It really does.

1492
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:36,550
But really...

1493
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:36,990
Whoa!

1494
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:37,670
Shit!

1495
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:39,410
Don't worry.

1496
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,650
Don't worry.

1497
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,250
Oh, I can't... Wait, can I dodge that?

1498
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:43,070
No, I can't.

1499
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,670
If I just keep...

1500
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,890
If I just keep punching!

1501
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,330
If I just keep punching!

1502
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:51,090
He'll die eventually!

1503
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:52,650
Okay.

1504
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:53,810
Oh shit.

1505
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:54,150
No.

1506
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,370
No, come on!

1507
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,670
Let me fucking finish him!

1508
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:03,650
Alright, nice.

1509
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,030
Oh my god!

1510
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:06,250
Okay.

1511
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:08,090
I did not need to dick punch that guy.

1512
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,250
Alright, nice.

1513
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,730
How come I can't dodge?

1514
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:14,070
Nice!

1515
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,410
Oh wait, it won't let me like...

1516
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:21,290
It won't let me punch him when like he's upright.

1517
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,590
No more tricks!

1518
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,010
Just one more!

1519
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,430
I don't know this puzzle.

1520
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:29,330
You're not the riddler.

1521
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:31,170
Alright.

1522
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:35,190
Okay, he wants me to go this way, but what if I don't go that way?

1523
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,850
What if I go this way?

1524
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:42,430
Okay, actually I don't know where this way goes.

1525
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,030
Okay, does this go back?

1526
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:46,050
Like...

1527
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,930
Okay, maybe I should go this way.

1528
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,590
I didn't really...

1529
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:54,010
Okay, but like isn't Gordon... I feel like Gordon's pretty fucking shit at his job.

1530
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,210
Not gonna lie.

1531
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:57,910
His whole thing was like to defeat corruption.

1532
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,290
But like...

1533
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:03,190
Does it look like it's going well?

1534
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:08,370
Crime doesn't come cheap if they got to pay their taxes.

1535
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,910
Rob, thank you for the super chat.

1536
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:10,330
Thank you.

1537
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,090
He's trying his best.

1538
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,150
Is this bear the bane of his life?

1539
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:32,030
I'm gonna get to Harley without anyone realizing.

1540
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:34,310
I'll give you your next present.

1541
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:37,410
Fail, and the old carter dies.

1542
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:40,650
Hell, I may even give you Harley.

1543
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,190
Bro, what the fuck?

1544
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,930
You could use a new sidekick.

1545
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:47,990
Bro, why do you keep fucking giving Harley a...

1546
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:49,950
Harley a way?

1547
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,390
No, it's a stealth mission!

1548
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:56,430
Okay.

1549
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,210
Alright, it's time to stealth.

1550
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,110
Alright, not gonna lie.

1551
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,810
The fact that he keeps giving away Harley...

1552
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:06,090
It's not great.

1553
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,930
I only saw 10%.

1554
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,290
Alright, let's open this.

1555
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:20,210
Yeah, this is really giving me some heavy NTR vibes, man.

1556
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:27,070
Joking, I'm not... I don't really want to know what's going on in your bedroom life right about now.

1557
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,750
But like, as Batman, um...

1558
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:30,550
I don't know.

1559
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:35,670
I... Batman has enough lady problems at the moment.

1560
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,590
So like, I really don't care.

1561
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:45,370
Thank you, Super Chat!

1562
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:46,150
Thank you!

1563
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,930
Joker more like the cucker!

1564
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:49,950
Oh my god!

1565
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:53,670
Ah, yes.

1566
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,850
Goo number 20 hundred is gonna kill me.

1567
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:58,690
Alright, here I go.

1568
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:02,910
Harley, please.

1569
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:06,250
Is this really what you want, Harley?

1570
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:08,530
Harley, please.

1571
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,460
Can I kill him?

1572
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,720
Or do I just walk past?

1573
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,380
Do I just...

1574
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,700
walk past him?

1575
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,200
walk past him?

1576
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:29,300
walk past him?

1577
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,400
There's no way he'd notice.

1578
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,260
There's no way he'd notice.

1579
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,220
There's no way.

1580
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:41,550
There's no...

1581
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:42,670
There's no...

1582
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,470
You know what?

1583
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:46,430
Fuck it.

1584
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,550
There's no way, right?

1585
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:49,350
There's no way.

1586
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:52,110
Nice.

1587
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:52,370
Alright.

1588
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:54,190
It's okay.

1589
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:57,870
If I don't see what they actually look like, Um...

1590
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,470
I can't humanize him.

1591
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,030
That's fucked up!

1592
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:03,850
That's what like...

1593
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,790
That's like an actual, like, strategy.

1594
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:07,770
Oh, hey, Ridley!

1595
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:08,810
Nice.

1596
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:17,430
As long as you don't humanize them, and you don't see what they look like, it's okay.

1597
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:20,110
Get over here.

1598
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:26,110
So, like, I'm not actually killing anybody.

1599
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:34,780
Alright.

1600
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,620
Can he see me through the...

1601
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,800
Can he see me through this?

1602
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:40,700
It's great.

1603
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,440
There's just skeletons.

1604
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:42,720
Skeletons aren't real.

1605
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:46,400
Alright.

1606
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,260
Is that him?

1607
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,750
Skeletons aren't real.

1608
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:58,290
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1609
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:00,430
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1610
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:00,830
Woah, woah, woah.

1611
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:01,030
Come on.

1612
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:01,490
Turn around.

1613
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:02,870
Turn around.

1614
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,010
Turn around.

1615
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:06,410
Okay.

1616
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:06,850
Nice.

1617
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:09,110
So...

1618
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:13,210
I like how I, like, jab him in the fucking back.

1619
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,010
Alright.

1620
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:16,110
We gotta get the last guy.

1621
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,190
Okay.

1622
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:18,990
How the fuck do I get the last one?

1623
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,170
Guess what's inside you right now.

1624
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:23,670
Blood!

1625
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,230
What else would be inside me?

1626
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:31,660
Okay.

1627
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,360
You can't see me from there.

1628
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,280
Okay.

1629
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,160
Wait.

1630
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,120
Who's that over there?

1631
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,060
A blue skeleton.

1632
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:39,540
Hahaha.

1633
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,260
I'm just gonna...

1634
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,360
Okay.

1635
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,340
It would really suck if he just turns around.

1636
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,560
There you go!

1637
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:48,460
What's...

1638
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:48,620
Yeah!

1639
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:48,920
Tomato!

1640
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:52,100
See?

1641
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:53,720
Okay.

1642
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,200
There's a no right?

1643
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,500
Holy fuck!

1644
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:00,940
Okay.

1645
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:01,820
Okay.

1646
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,380
That would've been...

1647
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,820
That would've been awkward.

1648
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,360
Okay.

1649
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,620
How do I do this?

1650
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:12,280
Alright.

1651
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,200
A little oopsie there, but it's okay.

1652
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,000
They can't hear.

1653
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,280
How do I get past this?

1654
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:20,720
Okay.

1655
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,460
Oh!

1656
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,580
You can't hear this?

1657
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,180
Okay.

1658
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:27,560
Pick up.

1659
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:34,100
Can I just drop down?

1660
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:35,740
Hahaha!

1661
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,060
What if I just drop down?

1662
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,440
Okay.

1663
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,260
I'm like worried if I drop down.

1664
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,440
Do I drop?

1665
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,460
Wait.

1666
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:45,960
Is that...

1667
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,260
That's glass, right?

1668
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,280
Is that glass?

1669
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,660
I can't tell if that's glass.

1670
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:55,880
I can't tell if that's glass.

1671
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,480
Oh shit!

1672
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:56,860
It is!

1673
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,280
Okay.

1674
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,480
Can I... No I can't.

1675
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,460
Now I can be broken with enough force.

1676
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:04,620
Okay.

1677
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:11,120
Rrrrrrrr.

1678
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:11,960
Tagging it?

1679
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,020
Okay.

1680
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,400
Okay.

1681
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,880
I feel like I might die if I do this.

1682
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:17,600
Okay.

1683
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,300
I'll stand over.

1684
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:23,920
Nice!

1685
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:37,940
Gordon!

1686
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,540
Please just kill him, Gordon!

1687
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,800
Batman will keep thinking rehabilitation will work!

1688
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:44,760
Gordon!

1689
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:45,620
Just kill him!

1690
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Oh!

1691
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:48,420
Am I killing to you?

1692
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:49,400
Am I?

1693
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,300
Good!

1694
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,860
You're going to love this next bit.

1695
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:06,530
It wants Dr. Young's login.

1696
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:07,690
Never mind that.

1697
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:08,610
Get behind me.

1698
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:09,050
Now.

1699
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:11,170
Bane.

1700
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:12,410
Oh shit.

1701
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:14,850
Wait.

1702
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:15,910
That's Bane?

1703
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:17,450
I thought he broke up.

1704
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:22,250
What is Joker doing?

1705
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,190
Dr. Young.

1706
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,250
The brooch.

1707
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,640
What say we cut him down?

1708
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,080
Huh?

1709
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:41,620
No!

1710
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,140
Wait.

1711
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,700
Was one of the doctors...

1712
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:48,220
Was that doctor I saved evil?

1713
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,560
Gordon!

1714
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,080
Run!

1715
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,740
Oh fuck!

1716
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,060
No!

1717
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:04,460
No!

1718
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:05,520
Please don't break my back!

1719
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,220
Oh wait.

1720
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:07,360
Like I said.

1721
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,240
That's not going to do anything.

1722
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:09,140
No!

1723
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,060
My back!

1724
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:15,800
Oh shit.

1725
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,700
Oh fuck.

1726
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,240
Okay.

1727
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,520
Oh shit.

1728
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:23,300
Okay.

1729
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,420
How do I do this?

1730
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,420
Oh!

1731
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,980
I forgot to dodge!

1732
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:27,640
How do I dodge?

1733
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,200
How do you dodge?

1734
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:31,860
Oh shit.

1735
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,260
Oh!

1736
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:33,640
Okay.

1737
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,240
Guys.

1738
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:34,600
Guys.

1739
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,100
How the fuck do you dodge again?

1740
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:36,860
I don't remember!

1741
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,300
Okay.

1742
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:39,860
Okay.

1743
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,660
Can I just punch you?

1744
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:42,120
Oh!

1745
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,600
Oh!

1746
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:45,820
Fuck!

1747
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:46,760
Bro!

1748
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:48,880
Bro!

1749
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,540
Oh my god!

1750
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:52,760
Bane please!

1751
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:53,900
Please!

1752
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,060
Oh my... Okay.

1753
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,560
I figured it out.

1754
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,040
Oh god.

1755
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:03,600
Okay.

1756
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:03,920
Okay.

1757
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,980
What if I just throw batarangs at you?

1758
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:08,220
Okay.

1759
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:10,080
What did I do?

1760
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,320
I wasn't the doctor!

1761
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,700
What the fuck did I do?

1762
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:18,500
Okay.

1763
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,240
Okay.

1764
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:20,840
Alright.

1765
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,860
Come over here.

1766
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,200
There's a wall!

1767
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,120
Oh shit!

1768
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,080
There was a wall.

1769
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,300
Okay.

1770
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,380
What the fuck did I do?

1771
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:35,660
What did I do?

1772
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:38,600
I...

1773
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,540
Oh shit!

1774
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:40,340
Okay.

1775
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,540
That was my bad.

1776
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,200
How could you not run into a wall to stun Bane while he is charging?

1777
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:47,700
Oh.

1778
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,080
Okay.

1779
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,020
Okay.

1780
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,960
I have to stun him while he's charging.

1781
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,200
I thought to make him run into a wall.

1782
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,000
Okay.

1783
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,160
Oh!

1784
01:14:59,160 --> 01:14:59,640
Alright.

1785
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,120
There you go.

1786
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:00,880
Come on.

1787
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:01,380
Charge me.

1788
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:03,680
That's right.

1789
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,820
That's fucking right!

1790
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:07,960
Oh.

1791
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:08,240
Oh.

1792
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:08,520
Oh.

1793
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,200
I'm sorry.

1794
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,060
I'm so sorry.

1795
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,000
I didn't mean that.

1796
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,060
I didn't mean that.

1797
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:14,140
Okay.

1798
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,780
That's fucking right.

1799
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,120
Yeah!

1800
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,580
That's fucking right!

1801
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,300
Get a concussion.

1802
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:23,580
It's the legal way where you can't die.

1803
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,060
Can't see.

1804
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,440
That's right.

1805
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,360
Open your eyes.

1806
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:29,020
I don't want to get near.

1807
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,580
I don't want...

1808
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:32,980
I got near him.

1809
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,460
He fucking punched me back.

1810
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,120
Wait!

1811
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,280
He can heal himself?

1812
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:40,620
Whoa!

1813
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:40,880
Whoa!

1814
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:41,680
Okay.

1815
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:45,840
Oh shit!

1816
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:46,860
Oh!

1817
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,060
I do have to get near him!

1818
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,360
Nice!

1819
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:51,100
Yoink!

1820
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,080
Alright.

1821
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:53,780
I figured it out.

1822
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,380
I figured it out.

1823
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:56,680
Guys!

1824
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,120
I'm learning!

1825
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:57,440
...

1826
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,400
...

1827
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:02,980
Wait, what?

1828
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,180
That's not fair.

1829
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,280
This is a 1v1!

1830
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,980
Wait a minute, this is a 1v1!

1831
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,000
Wait a minute.

1832
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,260
Wait a minute.

1833
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,320
What happened to the 1v1?

1834
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,420
Oh, I am so fucked.

1835
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:15,540
Please.

1836
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,020
PLEASE!

1837
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:17,480
NO!

1838
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,340
I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THAT!

1839
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:25,160
Please, where's myself here?

1840
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,300
Please, friendly fire!

1841
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:31,320
Friendly fire!

1842
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,580
YES, THERE IS!

1843
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,780
Okay, there's friendly fire.

1844
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,360
That's all that matters.

1845
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,720
I'm so happy there's friendly fire.

1846
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,600
Holy fuck.

1847
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,240
Alright, we're fine.

1848
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:44,820
We're fine.

1849
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:45,320
We're fine.

1850
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,500
Alright, I'm learning.

1851
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,000
That's fucking right.

1852
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,000
They're dead.

1853
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,720
I'm like one hit.

1854
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,840
I'm so fucked.

1855
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,560
Bro, I'm so fucked.

1856
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:03,900
Oh my god, please.

1857
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:04,920
Please hit each other.

1858
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:05,520
Please.

1859
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,760
Please hit each other.

1860
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:07,500
Please.

1861
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,280
Oh, please!

1862
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:09,760
Yes!

1863
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,300
I'm just... I'm just hoping...

1864
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:16,720
Yes!

1865
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,220
Nice!

1866
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,240
Okay, I don't have to worry about them.

1867
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,340
I just need them to hit each other.

1868
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,100
That's fucking right.

1869
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:26,840
What are you gonna do, huh?

1870
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,760
If I keep running!

1871
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:31,900
There you go.

1872
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:35,830
Nice.

1873
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:37,810
YES!

1874
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:38,850
1 HP!

1875
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:40,790
And a dream!

1876
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,910
It's like bowling.

1877
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:44,430
It really is, actually.

1878
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:46,850
It actually is like bowling.

1879
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,140
I learned I didn't have to do anything.

1880
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,540
Thank fucking god there's friendly fire.

1881
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:12,980
Ooh!

1882
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:14,120
The Batmobile!

1883
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:15,940
I'm fine, Jim.

1884
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:16,800
Where's Quinn?

1885
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:17,820
Gone.

1886
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,440
Must have gotten loose while Bane was throwing you around.

1887
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,200
We need to get you off the island.

1888
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,040
I'm not a rookie.

1889
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:26,420
I can handle myself.

1890
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:28,300
Oh!

1891
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,300
What the fuck?

1892
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,660
How do you still have all those juices?

1893
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,520
No!

1894
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:36,080
No!

1895
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,020
Not my back!

1896
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,080
Not my back!

1897
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,820
Land the Bruja!

1898
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,700
No, Bane.

1899
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:44,960
This time I break you!

1900
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,820
Oh shit!

1901
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:50,800
Oh ho ho ho ho!

1902
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,120
My car!

1903
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,620
Bro, that was like... 50 million dollars!

1904
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:01,980
Bruce!

1905
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:03,640
Jim, get back here!

1906
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:08,400
We could have... we could have solved the homeless problem in Gotham City with that money.

1907
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,680
Not the Batmobile.

1908
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,620
Tax rate up.

1909
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:31,280
It has to be the doctor that went back to the mansion to get the papers.

1910
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,920
Frosty and Kai, thank you for joining the tomato farm!

1911
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,160
Thank you!

1912
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:36,600
Go through the city's computers.

1913
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,820
Pull up all you can find on Dr. Young.

1914
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,120
Alright.

1915
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:50,300
Imprisoned from birth to serve his dead father's sentence, Bane was raised inside the horrific remains of a Santa Prisca prison.

1916
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,540
His only friend in the hell hole was a teddy bear named Osito.

1917
01:19:54,240 --> 01:20:00,320
Finding solace in smuggled books and meditation, he developed incredible powers of concentration.

1918
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:10,920
When he was subjected to military experience using a steroid code named Venom, his iron-forged will helped him survive when other test subjects had died, and he managed to escape.

1919
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:16,000
Determined to prove his worth, he sought out Batman and broke the Dark Knight's spine.

1920
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,400
I feel like... okay.

1921
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,800
Like if he knew that worked, why doesn't he just always try to break his spine?

1922
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:24,440
Hehehehe.

1923
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,000
Think about it.

1924
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,020
Okay, but if you think about it, like you know...

1925
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:33,540
At like... it put him out of commission for a very long time.

1926
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:35,440
So like, it clearly worked.

1927
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:40,120
So like, why doesn't he just keep breaking his spine until he can't walk?

1928
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,420
Rage, thank you for the Akasupa!

1929
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,640
Thank you, thank you!

1930
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,320
Just lurking.

1931
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,360
Oh my god, thank you for your first Akasupa slash super chat!

1932
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,340
Thank you!

1933
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,260
Awesome, welcome!

1934
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,120
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships!

1935
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,040
Thank you, thank you!

1936
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,620
Uh, alright.

1937
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,900
But Batman recovered and managed to...

1938
01:20:59,020 --> 01:20:59,620
...best Bane.

1939
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:02,000
But like, he never tries to break his spine again!

1940
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:08,560
Cutting off the precious Venom supply, it transforms Bane into... into a superhuman.

1941
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,840
He just gave up after the first time.

1942
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,040
Went on Venom green.

1943
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:15,920
5'6".

1944
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,040
He's 5'6 without Venom?!

1945
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:20,820
Bro!

1946
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:21,860
Hahaha!

1947
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,000
Master strategist.

1948
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,000
Intense focus.

1949
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,260
Abnormally strong reactions.

1950
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:34,000
Determined to best Batman and all the others who's challenged him.

1951
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,140
I'll go through anything you find once I get to the cave.

1952
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,120
A...Venom?

1953
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,380
There's a Batcave here?

1954
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,160
It's best to plan ahead for situations like this.

1955
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,140
How'd you manage to keep this a secret?

1956
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,860
Batman, there's nine nurses and you built a Batcave!

1957
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:52,660
Do you think Dr. Young's been experimenting with animals?

1958
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,320
Yes, I'm worried.

1959
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,740
Bane seemed even more powerful than usual.

1960
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,500
Joker wants the Venom and that can only be trouble.

1961
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,080
I'm heading to Dead Man's Point in Arkham North.

1962
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,800
I'll contact you once I'm back.

1963
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,120
Bane is a short game.

1964
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,160
CJ, thank you for the super chat.

1965
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,440
Thank you, thank you.

1966
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,840
Holy shit, X!

1967
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,540
Thank you for the 50 gifted ships!

1968
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,740
Thank you, thank you!

1969
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:14,540
Thank you so much!

1970
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,680
Oh my god, that's a lot.

1971
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,880
Batman, you could have given them free healthcare.

1972
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,820
That is so true!

1973
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,220
I was like...

1974
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:28,800
There's like so many things wrong with Batman's logic!

1975
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:29,840
This...

1976
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,220
The Asylum...

1977
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:35,720
This entire island is run by nine nurses.

1978
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,880
Plus like five doctors or some shit.

1979
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,880
And then he built a fucking Batcave!

1980
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,540
He was like...

1981
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:49,200
What can we do to fix the mental health issues in Gotham City?

1982
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,820
Let me build another Batcave.

1983
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,000
To like beat up the issue.

1984
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,840
Like I don't understand his logic.

1985
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,560
More...

1986
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,460
Yeah, there's more security than there are nurses.

1987
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:07,940
Oh shit!

1988
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:08,500
Whoops!

1989
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:09,380
Okay, you know what?

1990
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:09,700
Fuck it.

1991
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,000
I need XP anyway.

1992
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,520
Like it's always nice to have XP.

1993
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,300
Oh.

1994
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,640
Critical strike.

1995
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:17,860
Nice.

1996
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:21,240
Oh my god, look at how strong I am now.

1997
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:21,560
Ow.

1998
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,240
Please!

1999
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,400
I'm pressing Y!

2000
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:30,850
Nice.

2001
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:32,950
If I keep pressing Y...

2002
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:34,830
X will die eventually.

2003
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:37,730
Okay.

2004
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:38,290
Come on.

2005
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:39,110
Get over here.

2006
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:44,790
If you solve all the problems...

2007
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,910
There will be no need for Batman.

2008
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:50,730
That is actually so fucking dark.

2009
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:51,530
Like...

2010
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:55,810
Like this is just a fucking ego trip for Batman.

2011
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:56,710
You know?

2012
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:58,630
Like he's just like...

2013
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:02,430
He does all of this just to feel good about himself.

2014
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,430
Like oh wow.

2015
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:06,210
Not having...

2016
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:08,990
Being a billionaire is just not good enough.

2017
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:10,790
He needs more.

2018
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:15,100
Your appointment?

2019
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:16,620
Very rude.

2020
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:20,580
Well seeing as you're here now, we might as well get started.

2021
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,320
Tell me about your childhood.

2022
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,720
Anything stand out?

2023
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:26,820
My parents died.

2024
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,680
Is that a tear I see?

2025
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,580
Too painful?

2026
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,840
You'll come back soon.

2027
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:35,900
I'll talk to it later then.

2028
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:39,380
How about baby boy then?

2029
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:41,940
Oh, bet you were shocked to see him...

2030
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,520
Well not really.

2031
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,960
This is like an asylum for criminals.

2032
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:50,200
I was hoping he'd fold you up like a piece of paper and let me stab you crazy.

2033
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:52,620
But even I don't get everything I want.

2034
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,720
So what was he doing here?

2035
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,020
Oh, questions, questions, questions.

2036
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:06,450
Well I'm assuming because you wanted to research the venom, right?

2037
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:07,430
Yeah.

2038
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:12,770
If you're researching the venom, then... then like that's why you brought him here?

2039
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:14,670
Because of the doctor?

2040
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:19,390
Alright, here we go.

2041
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:21,150
It's counting you find his work.

2042
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:22,450
Where the fuck is Zask?

2043
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:24,210
Turn around.

2044
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:26,470
Well, too late.

2045
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:31,070
Alright, let's go.

2046
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:32,370
Where am I?

2047
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:33,130
I'm still lost.

2048
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:37,330
Oh shit.

2049
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:38,210
Okay, more XP.

2050
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:38,990
Oh shit.

2051
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:39,130
Hello!

2052
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:41,510
I gotta beat you up for XP.

2053
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,530
Let's go.

2054
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:47,390
Grab the Bat Crowbar!

2055
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:52,050
Nice.

2056
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:53,670
Wait, do I actually get XP?

2057
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:55,330
I can't tell.

2058
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:55,830
Yes, I do.

2059
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:56,550
Nice.

2060
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:00,050
Easy.

2061
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:03,350
The Bat Crowbar.

2062
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,730
Someone was like, no, Batman can't use regular items.

2063
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:08,970
He only uses...

2064
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:10,850
items with the word bat in it.

2065
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:14,790
What's stopping him from fucking dubbing this the crowbar?

2066
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:15,830
Alright, a Bat Crowbar.

2067
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:16,750
Get the Bat Gun!

2068
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,500
Well, the door is locked.

2069
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:26,420
Alright.

2070
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:27,760
The fuck?

2071
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,560
I guess I have to go all the way backwards?

2072
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:32,320
Oh, I have to go...

2073
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,340
Oh my gosh, I have to go like the other way around.

2074
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:39,700
Like, okay.

2075
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,640
You know how he's like he can't kill, right?

2076
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,400
I can get a Bat Gun and I just shoot the legs.

2077
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:48,060
Like, shoot the foot.

2078
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,880
Like, that's all I don't kill.

2079
01:26:51,960 --> 01:27:00,300
Like, I feel like giving a minor foot injury is better than brain damage.

2080
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:04,440
It's been a favorite suicide location on Arkham Island for over 100 years.

2081
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,940
Yeah, I know.

2082
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:09,940
I once saved an unfortunate inmate from leaping off into the rocks below.

2083
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:11,920
I found a cave entrance...

2084
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:12,720
Okay, sorry Batman.

2085
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,400
This is more important.

2086
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:13,920
Upgrades.

2087
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,640
Alright, guys.

2088
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,760
What do I upgrade next, guys?

2089
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:22,300
What's next?

2090
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:25,420
Sorry.

2091
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,240
Sorry for the lore interruption.

2092
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,060
What should I get next?

2093
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:37,200
Remote combo throw?

2094
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,480
Is the throw actually better?

2095
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,860
Okay, I'm gonna get the combo throw.

2096
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:44,180
Let's get a combo throw.

2097
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,240
Someone said maybe armor.

2098
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:45,960
Because you almost...

2099
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,860
I almost died but, like, I didn't.

2100
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,440
Yes, I almost but I didn't.

2101
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,600
Twin Batter has...

2102
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,660
Because they're cool.

2103
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,600
Okay.

2104
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,600
Okay, we're not taking advice from the guy that just wants it to look cool.

2105
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:08,820
We're not taking advice from that.

2106
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,300
Upgrade the twin... okay.

2107
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,200
I'm gonna get the combo there then.

2108
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,180
Alright,

2109
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,180
let's see.

2110
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,820
This way.

2111
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,360
Open.

2112
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:28,180
What?

2113
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,280
How the fuck do I get out?

2114
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:31,520
Open?

2115
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,500
I don't remember.

2116
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:35,200
Oh, it's this way.

2117
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,260
TwitterD and TwitterDom saw it.

2118
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,040
Can you see it?

2119
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,380
Alright, you guys have to help me with these riddles.

2120
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,580
I'm not smart enough for this.

2121
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,260
Alright, up I go.

2122
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,480
Okay, not up, clearly.

2123
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:54,440
Oh, wait, really?

2124
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:55,800
Nice.

2125
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:58,340
He can't use a crowbar, Jason.

2126
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,260
We're suffering from PTSD.

2127
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,640
He doesn't give a fuck about Jason.

2128
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:02,140
What?

2129
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:08,260
Oh shit, that's a lot of them.

2130
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,360
That's okay, free XP.

2131
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:10,320
Get over here.

2132
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:13,180
That's fucking right.

2133
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,140
God damn it!

2134
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:19,440
I can't believe they would just interrupt me like this!

2135
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:21,140
That's so fucked up.

2136
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:23,900
Alright, nice.

2137
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,400
Don't let him hit you.

2138
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,420
Why did you do that?

2139
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,700
How could you let him hit you like that?

2140
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,740
Just dodge, forehead.

2141
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:40,160
Okay, nice.

2142
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,340
Okay, nice.

2143
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,200
Nice.

2144
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,820
Alright, let's see.

2145
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:56,420
If he actually cared about Jason, he would stop getting orphans.

2146
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:57,980
To replace.

2147
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:02,700
That's my hot take.

2148
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:07,780
If he actually cares about them, why are they so easily replaceable?

2149
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:16,770
I don't know.

2150
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:17,330
Alright, let's see.

2151
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:20,070
See-saw by outer gate?

2152
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:21,730
Where the fuck does that mean?

2153
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:23,310
What the fuck?

2154
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:25,030
Where is the other gate?

2155
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:28,990
Here?

2156
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:35,410
All cards, all ID cards are to be shown.

2157
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:36,750
Where is the other gate?

2158
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:37,590
Here?

2159
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:43,060
What does outer gate mean?

2160
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:44,700
North?

2161
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:45,840
West?

2162
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:46,900
Where's north?

2163
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,800
Where is north?

2164
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:50,200
Where is north?

2165
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,100
Where is north?

2166
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:51,620
Oh!

2167
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,260
I figured it out!

2168
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,920
Where's the see-saw?

2169
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:03,180
See-saw?

2170
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,320
This is north, right?

2171
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,580
Oh, there it is!

2172
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,520
There it is, I figured it out.

2173
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:14,060
Nice.

2174
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,580
Why is there tweedledee and tweedledoo?

2175
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,580
That's a real criminal?

2176
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,800
That's just Alice in Wonderland.

2177
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:24,800
Cousins with an uncanny resemblance to each other.

2178
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,520
Deaver and Dumfreetweet.

2179
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,300
Why the f- I feel so bad for these kids.

2180
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:32,360
That's when you know their parents did not love them.

2181
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:38,900
Deaver and Dumfreetweet both shared criminal leanings and a fixation on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.

2182
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:44,700
Teaming up, they've modeled themselves after tweedledum and tweedledee from that book.

2183
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:50,460
Planning often outrageous and absurd schemes that trap the- That is their real name.

2184
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:50,900
Wow.

2185
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,100
1940- Yeah, that seems like characters made it from 1943.

2186
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,900
Oh yeah, the Mad Hatter!

2187
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,060
Yeah, I remember the Mad Hatter.

2188
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,180
I remember that from Teen Titans.

2189
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,140
Do you know about the hidden room later on in the game?

2190
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:11,980
No, this is my first time playing this game.

2191
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,860
Thanks for playing one of my favorite games.

2192
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:14,140
Thank you.

2193
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:14,800
Thank you for the super chat.

2194
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:15,120
Thank you.

2195
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:15,580
Thank you.

2196
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:15,820
Columbus.

2197
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:16,720
Thank you again.

2198
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,680
Wait, Jason uses guns?

2199
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:23,840
The fuck?

2200
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,380
Batman, you clearly have not taught your robins well.

2201
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,560
Wait, the Mad Hatter wasn't in Teen Titans?

2202
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,020
Where was he in?

2203
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:38,840
Was he in the Justice League Unlimited?

2204
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:43,240
I swear he was in like one of the TV shows.

2205
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:47,460
Because I like- Unless he was in the comic book series.

2206
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,880
I actually own some of the TV shows.

2207
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,540
I don't know if it's in the Teen Titans comics.

2208
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:53,400
That was based off the- That was based off the show.

2209
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:59,460
I know that he was from somewhere, but I don't remember.

2210
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,420
I remember seeing the Mad Hatter in something.

2211
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:09,880
Where's the Batcave?

2212
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,660
I'm literally below it.

2213
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:15,500
Is it like right here?

2214
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:21,700
Locate the cave at- Did I locate it?

2215
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,260
Oh, it's there.

2216
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:26,480
Okay, I was gonna be like, where?

2217
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,220
Oh my god.

2218
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,000
I was like, I- I located it?

2219
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:32,980
Question mark?

2220
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:35,940
I'm Batlost.

2221
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,560
I am directionally challenged Batman.

2222
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:43,300
One of my favorite Batman episodes from the anime series.

2223
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:45,720
I don't know which anime series this is.

2224
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,520
But like, oh is it the Music Meister?

2225
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,020
Only because Neil Patrick Harris.

2226
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,100
That's why I had my How I Met Your Mother craze.

2227
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:01,700
Scan the thing beside me?

2228
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:02,880
There's something beside me?

2229
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,680
Oh, the Brave and the Bold.

2230
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:10,880
There's so many anime shows that I've like- I have not kept track of like what they're called.

2231
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:11,300
Oh, there is!

2232
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:14,500
The puzzle.

2233
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:18,500
My family's blood ran through the heart of my heart.

2234
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:23,000
We were doctors, politicians, and teachers.

2235
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:28,640
We have been the organ cleaning the arterial filth from the city.

2236
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:33,060
We have been its servants, giving all to protect it.

2237
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:37,060
And still it has chosen to hurt us.

2238
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,200
So yeah, thank you for the super chat.

2239
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:41,480
Thank you.

2240
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,400
All villains in the game are from the comics except for Harley.

2241
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,760
Oh yeah, I know Harley Quinn was invented just for the animated show.

2242
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:49,020
Yeah.

2243
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,240
I remember that.

2244
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:53,980
Alright, Apako.

2245
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:02,820
Let's see.

2246
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:09,340
I think like the best DC anime show was 100% of Justice League.

2247
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,920
Slash Justice League Unlimited.

2248
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:15,200
I think cause like- I think it aged quite well.

2249
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:18,080
The writing for that show aged incredibly well.

2250
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:21,520
And it was not just for kids, but like adults could watch it too.

2251
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:24,540
Cause it tackled like- It tackled like- It tackled like- Um...

2252
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:28,580
Moments in there that was meant for like- Like even adults could understand.

2253
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,520
Like actual real moments.

2254
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:34,000
Like they didn't like pussy out on shit.

2255
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:58,000
I will forever- I will forever associate the voices- Cause like when they like redub Martian Manhunter, I could never- I could never like- Deal with the new voice actors for Martian Manhunter.

2256
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:02,500
Because the only voices I associate with Martian Manhunter was from the Justice League.

2257
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:04,920
Nice, I did it.

2258
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,520
God millions- It's not paying taxes.

2259
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:09,220
He does this.

2260
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:17,900
Young Justice was good.

2261
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:18,840
Young Justice was good.

2262
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:22,300
But then every time you reboot a show, It never goes well.

2263
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:25,440
Cause they have to compromise if they're rebooting a show.

2264
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,780
And also it takes like a- A couple of years for that to happen.

2265
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:35,040
So like- The story that they wanted to tell was already like, watered down.

2266
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:39,180
Except Samurai Jack?

2267
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,540
Okay, remember the ending of Samurai Jack, then say that again.

2268
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:07,600
Looks like she was experimenting on the Arkham patients.

2269
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:11,780
This new chemical only barely resembles the original venom compound.

2270
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:16,220
There are a number of changes that appear to amplify the strength of the drug.

2271
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:19,120
Multiple references to a Titan formula.

2272
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:26,580
Even a small amount could trigger a venom-like transformation in the host, eliminating the need for the storage tank Bane requires.

2273
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,880
Hang on, these notes aren't complete.

2274
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,540
The formula is missing.

2275
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:33,780
That must be the secret.

2276
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:34,900
The secret Dr. Young is hiding.

2277
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:38,640
If Joker gets his hands on this, he will create an army of a thousand Banes.

2278
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:40,900
Thank God.

2279
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:43,080
Is Joker crazy enough to do that?

2280
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:50,100
What kind of- What kind of- Yeah, it's gonna be like, Barba, what the fuck are you saying?

2281
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:52,780
Is Joker crazy enough to do- Bro!

2282
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:53,940
What?

2283
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:01,960
You should never question about Joker sanity.

2284
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:03,540
Bruce, wait!

2285
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,180
Thank you for the 50 gifted chips!

2286
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,020
Holy fuck, thank you.

2287
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:12,560
They're appreciated, Bruce Wayne, instead of helping your city.

2288
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,700
I mean, you know what?

2289
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:15,360
Fuck it.

2290
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,380
That's all right, you don't need to help your city.

2291
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,680
Just keep gifting me.

2292
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:24,400
Alright, nice, I upgraded my- my fucking grapplehook.

2293
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:28,280
I'm going after her.

2294
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:30,680
She was heading to the mansion with Cash.

2295
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:35,840
I'm going up top by- Why would Cash have like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like a- like This is like a fucking... phone.

2296
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:38,300
Just be like, Cash don't do it!

2297
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:40,520
She's fucking crazy!

2298
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,860
Answer your phone, Cash!

2299
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,860
Alright, how do I get out of here?

2300
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:50,530
Is he crazy enough to do it?

2301
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:51,890
If he asks if somebody...

2302
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:54,890
Barbara, bro, she shot... Barbara!

2303
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:59,730
He literally made you paralyzed and you're asking, is he crazy enough to do this?

2304
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:08,620
Alright, so let Batclaw... LT, aim my Batclaw.

2305
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:11,040
But what does the Batclaw do?

2306
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,280
Oh, it just moves boxes.

2307
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,220
That's stupid!

2308
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:23,800
Whoops!

2309
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:26,260
Sorry.

2310
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:31,920
Oh my god, Batman, these platforms fucking suck.

2311
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,160
Alright, let me...

2312
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,880
Okay, I didn't realize I had to move all the boxes.

2313
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,640
Oh my god.

2314
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:46,000
This Batclaw cost...

2315
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,360
$100,000.

2316
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:50,280
What is its purpose?

2317
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,940
To remove boxes.

2318
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:55,620
Gator, thank you for the super chat.

2319
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:56,560
Thank you, thank you.

2320
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:59,020
Oh, it opens vents too?

2321
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,380
Oh, thank fucking god.

2322
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:01,660
Alright.

2323
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,160
Alright, $100,000 Batclaw.

2324
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:05,840
So fucking worth.

2325
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:09,820
Why would you hurt me reminding me the ending of Samurai Jack?

2326
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:12,360
Okay, what I hate was that people be like...

2327
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:15,180
But Doki, they like...

2328
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,340
They like fixed it in the game.

2329
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,600
Yeah, but the game is like mediocre.

2330
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,840
It wasn't even like...

2331
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:28,120
The best fucking game ever.

2332
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:29,640
It was like...

2333
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:30,620
Super...

2334
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,640
It was like just an average game.

2335
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,740
And not everybody fucking...

2336
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:37,800
Plays the Samurai Jack game too.

2337
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:39,140
So it's like...

2338
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:40,720
Yeah, so people were like, there was a game?

2339
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:43,000
So it's like...

2340
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,440
Like, I understand why, but it's still...

2341
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,160
Doki...

2342
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,000
Might as well just put that ending in the actual show.

2343
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:19,700
I'd be scared to criticize Joker.

2344
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:31,810
There was a Samurai Jack game?

2345
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:38,490
Whoa!

2346
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:55,330
I feel like that's like one of Joker's many things.

2347
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:56,850
Like he doesn't kill.

2348
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,370
He just does that.

2349
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:00,490
Because like the amount of people he just...

2350
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,170
Puts people in wheelchairs.

2351
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:03,290
Is like...

2352
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:04,970
Surprisingly a lot.

2353
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:08,210
It's like...

2354
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:09,890
His like go-to thing.

2355
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:11,410
Where he's like...

2356
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:13,230
Where instead of killing, he just...

2357
01:42:13,230 --> 01:42:14,630
Puts them in wheelchairs.

2358
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:17,590
Which IMO is pretty fucked up.

2359
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:19,870
Just like Batman.

2360
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,860
Yeah, he does kill.

2361
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:29,180
But then it's like...

2362
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:30,480
It's either kill or wheelchair.

2363
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:38,380
Double tap for it.

2364
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,040
This ain't even the main door.

2365
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:45,220
Wrong one.

2366
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,260
Wrong one!

2367
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:50,480
I fucking...

2368
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,240
I fucking chose the wrong one!

2369
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:53,440
Whoa!

2370
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,380
Why is it still not...

2371
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:57,760
Oh wait!

2372
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,500
Sorry, I didn't know my left and right.

2373
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:06,220
Sorry!

2374
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:07,380
I pressed...

2375
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,360
I pressed left T instead of...

2376
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:10,940
Right T.

2377
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:12,220
Sorry.

2378
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,780
I'm still learning my left and right right now.

2379
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,400
That makes much more sense actually.

2380
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:19,280
No!

2381
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,840
I was about to send your guy to the hospital!

2382
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:24,720
Oh shit.

2383
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:27,060
Oh fuck!

2384
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:27,820
Not a box.

2385
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:30,720
Okay, nice.

2386
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:34,540
No, come on!

2387
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,240
How did you bet up?

2388
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:37,240
Okay.

2389
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:39,600
Nice.

2390
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:44,780
I'm currently at work but real quick, I wanna say that I've enjoyed your streams for a while.

2391
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,040
You're so infectious when you're feeling joy.

2392
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:47,780
You're truly wonderful.

2393
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:48,940
Thank you Plastergame!

2394
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:49,760
Thank you to Super Chat!

2395
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:50,100
Thank you!

2396
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:50,700
Thank you!

2397
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,720
Alright, I think...

2398
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:56,040
I think I need to look at the map real quick.

2399
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:56,520
Oh wait, nice!

2400
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:58,300
I can actually open that now!

2401
01:43:59,520 --> 01:43:59,920
Okay.

2402
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:00,820
Oop!

2403
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:02,540
Get over here.

2404
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:06,900
Alright.

2405
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:07,740
Nice.

2406
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:08,380
Oop!

2407
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:10,480
And then...

2408
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,400
Yoink!

2409
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:12,780
Mine now!

2410
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,400
Yay!

2411
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,040
Alright, Riddler!

2412
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:28,420
You don't even have like an actual presence in the game!

2413
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:43,020
If Killer Croc can find love, so can you, Chat.

2414
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:48,470
Woah!

2415
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,700
Here you go, thank you for the super chat!

2416
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:00,460
Thank you, thank...

2417
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:00,840
Also, Josh!

2418
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,060
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships!

2419
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:02,540
Thank you!

2420
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:03,200
Thank you!

2421
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:16,390
One of Joker's oldest aliases.

2422
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:21,590
So, Joker pays Dr. Young to create his army and then all of a sudden he stops.

2423
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:23,250
Doesn't make any sense.

2424
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:26,190
Open the door behind me?

2425
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:28,170
There's a door behind me?

2426
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:29,930
Here?

2427
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:32,330
Is that Killer Croc?

2428
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:33,310
Guys, I don't know.

2429
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:35,710
The room where it's like glowing?

2430
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:39,490
Also, Sat, welcome to the doke... uh... the tomato farm.

2431
01:45:39,570 --> 01:45:40,470
I was gonna say dokey farm.

2432
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:41,850
Welcome to the tomato farm!

2433
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:42,530
Welcome, welcome!

2434
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:45,090
Also, I didn't manage to read your super chat, Liga.

2435
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:48,250
The Joker stalked and terrified a dude for cutting him off in traffic.

2436
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:50,490
That's some next level intense right there.

2437
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:59,210
What you didn't know is that, um, he... one... one journalist started criticizing him and then he like told him, he's like, you know what?

2438
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:00,810
You're right, I don't have friends.

2439
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:02,890
You're gonna become my best friend now.

2440
01:46:02,950 --> 01:46:03,290
And then he's like, you know what?

2441
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:03,390
I'm your best friend.

2442
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:10,870
And then he like stalked this man for like several years and he wouldn't let him have any friends after that because he was like, you don't need friends.

2443
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,970
I am your best friend.

2444
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:17,790
And then he like killed his roommates and also like hurt his wife and everything.

2445
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:22,750
And then... because he was like, you don't need anybody else now.

2446
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:25,990
I'm your best friend now forever and ever.

2447
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:30,570
But yeah, anyway, I don't know about opening this door.

2448
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:32,650
I don't know.

2449
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:32,670
I don't know.

2450
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:32,910
I don't know.

2451
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:35,210
I don't know.

2452
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:36,190
Oh no!

2453
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:40,670
I'm gonna do it.

2454
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:44,770
I shouldn't have done it.

2455
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:53,930
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

2456
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:57,890
All right nice.

2457
01:46:58,050 --> 01:46:58,950
All right we go this way.

2458
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:01,930
Oh more teeth!

2459
01:47:02,490 --> 01:47:03,330
Teeth time!

2460
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:04,150
Yes!

2461
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:05,730
Teeth XP!

2462
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:07,950
Teefexp.

2463
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:08,510
Nice.

2464
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:11,570
Alright, door open.

2465
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:14,910
Friendship goals!

2466
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:17,030
No name, thank you for the super chat.

2467
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:17,450
Thank you.

2468
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:20,230
A puzzle has many sides.

2469
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:22,410
And I couldn't read the rest of the riddle.

2470
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:23,830
There's a wall!

2471
01:47:23,890 --> 01:47:24,670
I forgot about the wall.

2472
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:25,730
Alright.

2473
01:47:26,050 --> 01:47:28,050
I noticed... There's a Riddler trophy!

2474
01:47:29,330 --> 01:47:32,910
I'm gonna be 15% done with the Riddler trophies after this.

2475
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:40,490
Alright.

2476
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:47,240
Alright, where's the...

2477
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,540
God, I still hate that flashbang.

2478
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:50,940
There's a wall!

2479
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,280
I swear I saw... Oh, there it is!

2480
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:54,240
Nice!

2481
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,120
Another Riddler trophy!

2482
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:55,720
Okay.

2483
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:58,140
I'm gonna tag the wall real quick.

2484
01:47:58,380 --> 01:47:59,680
Gonna do a Banksy.

2485
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:01,580
Boop!

2486
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:04,200
It's a mysterious wall.

2487
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:06,060
Yoink!

2488
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:08,060
Nice.

2489
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:11,660
I'm gonna build over that one.

2490
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,560
Where's your 3D model, Riddler?

2491
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:16,700
That's fucking right.

2492
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,520
Puzzle, but only some are visible.

2493
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,680
Let's see... The Riddler put...

2494
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,080
Actually, wait, you're right.

2495
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,460
Sounds like she had a change of heart.

2496
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,300
She tried to block the payments.

2497
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:38,100
Joker doesn't like it when his partners try to back out.

2498
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:40,620
So he decided to get himself back to our...

2499
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:44,840
Exactly.

2500
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:48,580
I just realized the Riddler has been, like...

2501
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:50,800
placing drywall around the place.

2502
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:53,420
Oh my god, he's even a handyman?

2503
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:54,900
Well...

2504
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:56,600
Wait.

2505
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,580
I feel like... Is this...

2506
01:48:59,400 --> 01:48:59,500
Oh.

2507
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:01,340
Yeah, I was gonna say...

2508
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:04,340
I was gonna say this is not safe.

2509
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:08,420
This is actually not safe at all.

2510
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:13,700
He had so much free time.

2511
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,520
I've hacked into her email accounts.

2512
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:16,860
Wait.

2513
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:22,250
I've hacked into her email accounts.

2514
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:22,950
I've hacked into her email accounts.

2515
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:23,510
And the second.

2516
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:24,770
A message from Joker,

2517
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:39,940
picture of a dead baby...

2518
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:41,640
Whoa, Joker!

2519
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,040
He says, I'm coming for you,

2520
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:51,180
donkey.

2521
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,200
No mystery why she's so scared.

2522
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:55,920
Again with the wheelchairs, Joker?!

2523
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:01,660
Payton, thank you the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2524
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:03,980
You're the first streamer I've ever got on my way to watch.

2525
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,400
I'm so happy to be a Dragoon.

2526
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,000
Love the content, but I'm glad you're heroes.

2527
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:08,460
Thank you the super chat, Payton.

2528
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:09,220
Thank you, thank you.

2529
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:12,040
I'm glad you've been enjoying the content so far.

2530
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:17,340
I told you guys!

2531
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:19,460
It's either kill or wheelchair!

2532
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:20,900
Like Joker!

2533
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,300
That's like his whole thing!

2534
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,820
He's like, I'm not gonna kill you, but wheelchair.

2535
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:36,800
Alright, let's see this way.

2536
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:42,280
The wheelchair kick is crazy!

2537
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,560
Guys, I think the Joker has a problem.

2538
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:00,260
Let's see.

2539
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,140
I'll make sure there's nothing here.

2540
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,420
Oh, Sonaya, thank you for the Akasupa!

2541
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:05,800
Thank you, thank you!

2542
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,640
I'm just happy to be held back.

2543
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,320
Take this red because you're a tomato.

2544
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,340
Thank you, thank you for the Akasupa!

2545
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:12,480
Thank you, thank you!

2546
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:13,760
Alright, this way.

2547
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:15,300
There's a light.

2548
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:17,560
There's a lot of wheelchairs in this series.

2549
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:21,980
Oh nice, you're saying we can get over there?

2550
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:25,760
Fuck.

2551
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:26,660
Oh wait.

2552
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:30,160
Wait, what the fuck?

2553
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:31,200
How do I get over there?

2554
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:34,760
Okay, let's get back here.

2555
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:39,980
I'm glad I could like not have to worry about losing... going back from the beginning.

2556
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:41,900
Oh, not yet?

2557
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:44,400
Use the back claw?

2558
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:47,560
I feel like the back claw is not the right way.

2559
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:50,620
Is it... is it actually the back claw?

2560
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:51,900
Can I pull this?

2561
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,360
What's the point if I can't pull this?

2562
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,440
What if I just pull this wall down?

2563
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:01,740
Need line launcher.

2564
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:02,800
Oh, I don't have that yet.

2565
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:03,400
Okay.

2566
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:04,460
We'll just go.

2567
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,320
Oh, teeth.

2568
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:10,100
Okay, I'm gonna make sure there's no fucking drywall again.

2569
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,120
That the Riddler put out.

2570
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:14,420
Teeth.

2571
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:19,080
Max, thank you for the ten gifted chips.

2572
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:20,100
Thank you, thank you!

2573
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:23,500
And welcome to the tomato farm, mossy pickles and toaster.

2574
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:24,280
Welcome, welcome.

2575
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:25,200
I'm also Payton.

2576
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,040
Alright.

2577
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:29,360
Oh!

2578
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:31,520
Let's see.

2579
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:33,020
No drywall.

2580
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:35,340
Tape patient session two.

2581
01:52:35,580 --> 01:52:37,480
Patient name, Waylon Jones.

2582
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:38,700
A.K.A.

2583
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:39,360
Killer Crook.

2584
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:04,070
Poor choice of words.

2585
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:05,350
No one

2586
01:53:09,310 --> 01:53:10,490
figured as much.

2587
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:13,670
So, how about this, Doc?

2588
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:17,710
You let me go now, and I won't eat you.

2589
01:53:18,170 --> 01:53:20,150
You don't really eat people.

2590
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:22,590
It's just an urban myth.

2591
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:23,510
Oh, you think?

2592
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:33,010
I don't know if you would like to play chicken with, like, a guy that has Killer in his name.

2593
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:37,810
I feel like...

2594
01:53:37,810 --> 01:53:37,990
I feel like...

2595
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:40,510
You know, you're like, you don't eat people.

2596
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:42,770
Mr. Killer Crook.

2597
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:46,930
I don't know.

2598
01:53:47,170 --> 01:53:48,190
I feel like...

2599
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:50,930
For the sake of your safety...

2600
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:54,210
If this guy's first name is fucking Killer...

2601
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:55,050
I don't know.

2602
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:57,730
I wouldn't fucking try and test that name out.

2603
01:54:00,570 --> 01:54:02,330
He kills not eat.

2604
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:04,190
Yes, but...

2605
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:06,110
It's like, similar thing.

2606
01:54:06,330 --> 01:54:07,410
Like, you still die.

2607
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:10,310
And she's like, you won't eat me.

2608
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:11,770
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2609
01:54:11,850 --> 01:54:13,110
Instead of eating, he kills.

2610
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:13,750
Wow.

2611
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:17,490
That is clearly the better alternative.

2612
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:21,370
Vegetarian Croc.

2613
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:25,150
Pacifist Croc.

2614
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:31,500
Alright, let's see.

2615
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:32,540
I feel like...

2616
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:33,760
I shouldn't go over here.

2617
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,600
Crocs puts her in the wheelchair.

2618
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:40,380
Alright.

2619
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:47,730
Return to surface via... Oh, I did it.

2620
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,390
Yeah.

2621
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:52,300
Ding dong.

2622
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:13,270
Oh.

2623
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:20,800
There's snipers?

2624
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:26,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2625
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:28,120
No, no, no, no, don't climb down.

2626
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:31,460
Oh, shit.

2627
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:32,740
Wow.

2628
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:33,520
Oh, fuck.

2629
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,360
You can't.

2630
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:36,220
Oh, shit.

2631
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:36,460
No.

2632
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:37,060
Okay.

2633
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:37,780
Nice.

2634
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:39,060
Did not mean to...

2635
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:41,460
Did not mean to tag the fucking floor.

2636
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,940
Where the fuck is the other sniper?

2637
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:45,480
Okay.

2638
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:47,200
That scared the shit out of me.

2639
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:48,280
Oh, there he is.

2640
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:50,720
Sorry.

2641
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:53,520
I panicked.

2642
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,360
Oh, my God.

2643
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:56,540
I panicked so hard.

2644
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:57,500
Alright.

2645
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:00,000
Give me a sec here.

2646
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:01,560
Okay.

2647
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:03,060
No way.

2648
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:03,320
Oh, shit.

2649
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,360
Okay.

2650
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:06,800
If I just do that.

2651
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,400
Can I just...

2652
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:12,780
Okay.

2653
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,360
This is fucking useless.

2654
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:18,460
Okay.

2655
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:19,480
Alright.

2656
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:20,420
Where do I go?

2657
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:22,120
Where is this?

2658
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:22,960
Okay.

2659
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:23,700
Arkham Mansion.

2660
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:24,980
If I keep running...

2661
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:27,120
If I keep running, I'll be safe.

2662
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:28,280
Alright.

2663
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:31,660
Wew.

2664
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:33,280
Wew.

2665
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:34,880
Okay.

2666
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:35,780
Which way is this?

2667
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:36,620
Alright.

2668
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:37,360
I'll just keep running.

2669
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:41,220
There is no way they can catch me.

2670
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,160
Am I going the right...

2671
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:43,340
Okay.

2672
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:43,700
Nope.

2673
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:46,160
I will never go the right way apparently.

2674
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:49,160
If I keep running...

2675
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:52,700
If I keep running, there is no way a bullet is fath...

2676
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:53,740
You know I'm gonna beat up the sniper.

2677
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:54,580
Actually.

2678
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:55,220
Fuck this.

2679
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,820
I'm gonna beat up this sniper.

2680
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:58,120
Do I have stamina?

2681
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:58,260
I'm gonna beat up this sniper.

2682
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:58,920
I forgot!

2683
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:02,420
No, this is not a modern game anymore.

2684
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:03,620
Get over here.

2685
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,480
Get the fuck over here.

2686
01:57:05,540 --> 01:57:05,920
I forgot!

2687
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,380
Stamina- Oh shit!

2688
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:10,880
My punch is so strong.

2689
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:15,140
The sheer velocity of my punch fucking hit him.

2690
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:17,300
I forgot.

2691
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:20,160
This game came out like 14 years ago.

2692
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:23,360
So stamina wasn't invented back then.

2693
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,720
Alright, how do I get there?

2694
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:33,520
I think that's like the best part.

2695
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:36,080
Like- Oh shit, nice.

2696
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:40,700
The good old days.

2697
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:46,000
Where people were just- were just so good at running.

2698
01:57:47,010 --> 01:57:50,060
Legacy of this island has been well and truly buried.

2699
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:50,840
No?

2700
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:52,760
Okay.

2701
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:53,540
Ah shit!

2702
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:56,040
Whoops.

2703
01:57:57,380 --> 01:57:58,000
Alright.

2704
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:59,200
Don't worry, I got it.

2705
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:00,700
No!

2706
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:01,100
Nice!

2707
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,260
That's fucking right.

2708
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:05,920
The good old days.

2709
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:09,460
Like, I understand they want things to be realistic.

2710
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:14,060
But like, also like, I play video games not for the realism.

2711
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:19,120
I play video games to escape reality.

2712
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:24,500
If I wanna have no fucking stamina, I want no stamina.

2713
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:30,440
It's 14 years ago, games were actually made to be good.

2714
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:33,660
I feel like now games are just made to be like, realistic.

2715
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:37,680
But it's like, I don't want things to be realistic.

2716
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,180
They give us a super chat.

2717
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:41,340
Thank you, thank you Breezy.

2718
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:42,260
Should I save them?

2719
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:47,750
Oh, they're dead.

2720
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:50,090
Wait.

2721
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:51,910
Just to be sure.

2722
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:53,370
Oh yeah, they're dead.

2723
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:54,250
Wait!

2724
01:58:55,890 --> 01:58:56,590
They disappeared.

2725
01:58:57,250 --> 01:58:59,530
Oh my god, where the fuck did the monsters go?

2726
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:02,690
Where the fuck did the people go?

2727
01:59:06,050 --> 01:59:06,590
Saved.

2728
01:59:06,830 --> 01:59:08,290
Good job, Doki.

2729
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:09,290
You did it.

2730
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:16,020
Oh shit!

2731
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:19,180
What the fuck!

2732
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:19,840
Okay.

2733
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:21,100
Oh my!

2734
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:21,840
Get over here!

2735
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:23,820
Get over here!

2736
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:25,480
Get over here!

2737
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:27,660
Oh my god.

2738
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:29,880
Okay.

2739
01:59:43,850 --> 01:59:47,190
It's all about sending a message chat.

2740
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:50,970
Look, I sent a message to that one guy.

2741
01:59:53,190 --> 01:59:59,390
As long as that one guy knew what he was saying.

2742
01:59:59,390 --> 02:00:00,090
Knew what came.

2743
02:00:01,410 --> 02:00:02,910
Knew what went for him.

2744
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:05,230
That's all that matters.

2745
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:11,390
Woooo!

2746
02:00:13,190 --> 02:00:15,690
How the fuck can I start hacking?

2747
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:19,790
Okay.

2748
02:00:22,490 --> 02:00:23,810
Don't worry, I got this.

2749
02:00:25,170 --> 02:00:25,710
Alright.

2750
02:00:26,270 --> 02:00:28,410
I'm just gonna fucking beat the shit out of him.

2751
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:31,950
My only solution.

2752
02:00:33,290 --> 02:00:33,730
Fucking...

2753
02:00:34,650 --> 02:00:35,090
Punch.

2754
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:38,110
Oh shit, that's a wall.

2755
02:00:38,850 --> 02:00:39,550
Okay, it's fine.

2756
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:40,770
Get over here.

2757
02:00:41,390 --> 02:00:42,430
Get over here.

2758
02:00:44,530 --> 02:00:45,390
Alright, nice.

2759
02:00:46,470 --> 02:00:47,310
What's over here?

2760
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:48,230
Is this also a hack?

2761
02:00:48,350 --> 02:00:49,890
Or can I just bat around this?

2762
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:54,260
Can I?

2763
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:55,820
Oh I... Boom.

2764
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:56,980
Boom.

2765
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:57,900
No I can't.

2766
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:58,320
I have to hack.

2767
02:00:59,060 --> 02:00:59,500
Alright.

2768
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,280
Well fuck these snipers.

2769
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:03,240
Status deceased.

2770
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:06,520
Oh wait, recording.

2771
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:20,730
I don't think this is a persona.

2772
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,820
Bro, you just said you have a girlfriend!

2773
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:43,480
Bro!

2774
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:43,960
No!

2775
02:01:52,670 --> 02:01:54,210
The Joker Riz.

2776
02:01:54,430 --> 02:01:54,970
I don't know.

2777
02:01:56,210 --> 02:01:57,250
I feel like...

2778
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:59,310
I think like...

2779
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:03,230
I don't think you would want to have Joker be infatuated with you.

2780
02:02:03,430 --> 02:02:07,830
Because like, he would do some crazy shit just to have your attention.

2781
02:02:08,610 --> 02:02:11,590
I'd rather have Joker not be aware of my existence.

2782
02:02:18,690 --> 02:02:19,250
Weeeeee.

2783
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:23,110
Or you know, just don't live in Gotham.

2784
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:29,490
I feel like a lot of the criminals, like, Gotham City has all the worst ones.

2785
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:30,570
Like...

2786
02:02:34,210 --> 02:02:36,330
Like, not gonna lie.

2787
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:38,370
Ah yes, your friend's gonna die here.

2788
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:39,430
Like...

2789
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:45,890
Of every single criminal, definitely, like, Batman's handling the worst ones.

2790
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:52,540
Alright, nice.

2791
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:52,940
Easy.

2792
02:02:57,470 --> 02:03:00,010
Just don't fucking live in Gotham.

2793
02:03:09,450 --> 02:03:10,610
Like, okay.

2794
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:12,590
So like, I feel like...

2795
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:13,330
Um...

2796
02:03:13,330 --> 02:03:22,570
Out of like, all the most well known DC villains, majority of the most famous DC villains all live in fucking Gotham City.

2797
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:30,090
Like, the Penguin, Bane, Joker, uh...Scarecrow, uh...

2798
02:03:30,570 --> 02:03:31,530
Mr. Freeze.

2799
02:03:32,350 --> 02:03:35,810
Um... Alright, now think about the Flash villain.

2800
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:36,970
Reverse Flash.

2801
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:40,490
It was me.

2802
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:42,050
I did Barry.

2803
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:43,770
I did all of that.

2804
02:03:43,890 --> 02:03:45,010
Alright, yeah.

2805
02:03:45,070 --> 02:03:52,670
Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Catwoman, Grundy, Two-Face, uh...

2806
02:03:55,390 --> 02:03:56,190
Alright.

2807
02:03:58,350 --> 02:03:58,750
Superman.

2808
02:03:59,370 --> 02:04:00,370
His villain.

2809
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:02,090
Reverse Sup...

2810
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:02,610
What was it?

2811
02:04:02,670 --> 02:04:03,570
Reverse Superman.

2812
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:04,990
Lex Luthor.

2813
02:04:05,150 --> 02:04:08,030
Who's just like the evil billionaire Batman.

2814
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:10,090
But like, even then, it's like...

2815
02:04:10,090 --> 02:04:12,290
It's not as bad as like the Joker.

2816
02:04:12,730 --> 02:04:13,290
Like...

2817
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:14,990
Superman.

2818
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:16,310
Lex Luthor.

2819
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:18,550
Um...

2820
02:04:19,510 --> 02:04:20,190
Um...

2821
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:22,030
Chucking...Bizarre...yeah.

2822
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:23,430
Bizarro.

2823
02:04:23,730 --> 02:04:25,590
And he was not even that bad.

2824
02:04:27,230 --> 02:04:28,550
And then...

2825
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:29,550
What was it?

2826
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:31,810
Like...General Zod.

2827
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:32,170
Yeah.

2828
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:33,570
And then...Darkseid.

2829
02:04:33,810 --> 02:04:38,070
But then like...Okay, Darkseid is like sort of like the Thanos of DC.

2830
02:04:38,530 --> 02:04:43,430
But even then, he just shows up like once every fucking five years.

2831
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:47,090
Joker is every day.

2832
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:56,160
Anyway...

2833
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:59,160
What I'm saying is that...I don't know.

2834
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:00,340
Maybe we should stop living.

2835
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:05,580
Maybe Batman is outrageously terrible at his job.

2836
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:10,240
If like 80% of the most well-known villains live in Gotham City.

2837
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:17,180
And me.

2838
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:37,580
Bam!

2839
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:38,480
Oh shit.

2840
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:39,560
Alright.

2841
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:41,660
There has to be like a place to grapple, right?

2842
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:46,280
Owning real estate in Metro City is a bad idea.

2843
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:47,640
Wait, what?

2844
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:49,400
I guess we have to like go up?

2845
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:02,280
Anton.

2846
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:03,080
Thank you for the super chat.

2847
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:03,400
Thank you.

2848
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:03,980
Thank you.

2849
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,340
But don't you forgot Captain Code.

2850
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:08,040
A man who best splashed with a hand-held refrigerator.

2851
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:11,640
I feel like it has to be...Oh, there it is.

2852
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:12,120
I see it.

2853
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:14,280
Is that a vent?

2854
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,120
Alright, now I have to go back.

2855
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:18,140
Use detective mode.

2856
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:19,560
Wait, that's a vent, right?

2857
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,220
Oh shit.

2858
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:28,780
Clayface is also Gotham City!

2859
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,940
You're just making me more right!

2860
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:36,980
Alright,

2861
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:42,460
nice.

2862
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:43,700
I'm here now.

2863
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:47,180
Alright.

2864
02:06:48,430 --> 02:06:48,720
Nice.

2865
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:50,460
Door open.

2866
02:06:57,660 --> 02:06:59,360
He just walked away!

2867
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:19,880
Okay, we have to kick the one with the gun.

2868
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:21,360
Wheee!

2869
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:25,100
Oh my God!

2870
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:28,660
It's like it came from a mile away!

2871
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:30,260
Nice.

2872
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:32,320
Countered.

2873
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:34,180
That's fucking right!

2874
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:35,160
BAM!

2875
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:36,740
Hospital bills!

2876
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:44,770
I guess I was like, but what about Cyborg Superman?

2877
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:46,730
Who knew about Cyborg Superman?

2878
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:52,050
More people know who the fuck the Riddler is!

2879
02:07:52,510 --> 02:07:54,210
The fucking cyborg Superman!

2880
02:07:54,650 --> 02:07:57,010
Who the fuck is Cyborg Superman?

2881
02:07:57,750 --> 02:08:01,450
That was the first time I even heard about Cyborg Superman!

2882
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:06,380
Alright.

2883
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:09,480
I had to tab out because my chat died.

2884
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:11,300
Me.

2885
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:16,790
Alright.

2886
02:08:20,030 --> 02:08:20,930
Let's see.

2887
02:08:21,590 --> 02:08:22,970
Okay, Dr. Young.

2888
02:08:23,250 --> 02:08:24,330
Okay, it has to be like here.

2889
02:08:24,330 --> 02:08:27,290
Let's see if there's anything I have to find out.

2890
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:34,510
If I remember correctly, the reason why that Gotham's criminals always got out of Arkham was due to this warden, Hugo Strange.

2891
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:37,730
Who purposely let them loose to study Batman.

2892
02:08:38,070 --> 02:08:40,010
And this is also Batman's problem!

2893
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:44,470
He funded- He fucking funded Arkham Asylum!

2894
02:08:45,010 --> 02:08:46,250
So like...

2895
02:08:47,450 --> 02:08:48,850
Isn't that his fault?

2896
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:51,530
For like, hiring practices?

2897
02:08:54,330 --> 02:08:56,170
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

2898
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:56,730
Thank you.

2899
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:57,450
Thank you.

2900
02:09:01,850 --> 02:09:09,310
Like, they could literally just have like an inspection to make sure there's no corruption r- Cause like, wouldn't Batman be like, That's weird.

2901
02:09:09,610 --> 02:09:12,850
Why are the criminals keep escaping almost every day?

2902
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:17,310
Surely the justice system isn't corrupt because of that.

2903
02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:22,730
Maybe it's just very unlucky that they keep fucking escaping Arkham Asylum.

2904
02:09:22,730 --> 02:09:26,570
Like, I- World's greatest detective, my fucking ass.

2905
02:09:35,330 --> 02:09:37,750
Claire, thank you for the 20 gifted chips.

2906
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:38,270
Thank you.

2907
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:38,830
Thank you.

2908
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:43,810
Damn, that's fucking crazy that people keep escaping.

2909
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:51,130
That's so crazy.

2910
02:09:57,170 --> 02:09:58,450
Oh shit, look, wheelchair.

2911
02:09:58,450 --> 02:09:59,750
Oh no.

2912
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:01,510
No, he brought it to work.

2913
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:05,570
What do I do here?

2914
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:07,770
Detective moding right now.

2915
02:10:08,870 --> 02:10:12,450
This is where- Isn't this where- Oh, there's a vent up here.

2916
02:10:12,570 --> 02:10:12,890
Okay.

2917
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:16,940
There.

2918
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:18,440
Run!

2919
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:19,480
There's a wheelchair!

2920
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:21,220
The Joker is near!

2921
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:24,420
Alright, nice.

2922
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:24,740
Okay.

2923
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:29,280
Alright, let's see.

2924
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:33,500
We gonna ל

2925
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:39,320
Oh!

2926
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:46,000
I remember there was, like, in the comic where Superman kills the Joker, and then Batman was like.

2927
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:52,460
There was, like- Batman was like- I think that's, like, one of my favorite, like, illustrate- I think that's one of my favorite, like...

2928
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:55,320
one of my favorite scenes because Batman is just like.

2929
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:58,080
Cause he's like, you can do that?

2930
02:10:58,360 --> 02:10:58,440
Because he's like, you can do that?

2931
02:10:58,540 --> 02:10:59,540
Batman did that right?

2932
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:28,680
Is this Mr. Freeze?

2933
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:32,500
No, no, because it's a scarab.

2934
02:11:32,940 --> 02:11:37,920
Because it feels like the body thing, but then I'm not sure because it's a scarab.

2935
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:47,680
But yeah, if you guys didn't know that, that Injustice, Superman, it's where basically it's like evil, the evil league or whatever.

2936
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:54,320
And then it's so fun, there's like a comic scene of the illustration of Superman killing Joker.

2937
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:57,580
And I just love Batman's face.

2938
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:04,300
I just love Batman's face in that because it's just so fucking stupid.

2939
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:06,080
It's just...

2940
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:12,540
Who is the main man in the main hall?

2941
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:13,540
Him?

2942
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,420
This guy?

2943
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:18,420
Who else would it be?

2944
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:24,370
I need to make sure there's like nothing here.

2945
02:12:24,790 --> 02:12:26,950
Oh shit, that's a lot of people here.

2946
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:27,490
Whoops.

2947
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:30,810
I was like, let me make sure there's nobody here.

2948
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:39,620
What the fuck?

2949
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:40,700
What am I supposed to do?

2950
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:41,640
Oh wait, upgrade time.

2951
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:45,480
Alright.

2952
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:48,040
Let's see.

2953
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:49,580
What do we upgrade, guys?

2954
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:52,760
Guys, what do we... Oh wait, I can do that?

2955
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:54,140
A and X.

2956
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:58,160
Oh my god, I've just been pressing X this entire time.

2957
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:03,360
Okay, powerful Batarang.

2958
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:04,700
Alright, let's see.

2959
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:09,220
Remote Batarang is really fun.

2960
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:10,340
Okay, we'll try that.

2961
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:12,000
Remote Batarang.

2962
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,400
Okay, upgrade it.

2963
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:14,680
Alright, how do I do this?

2964
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:16,440
Alright.

2965
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:19,120
Whoops.

2966
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:20,720
How do I...

2967
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:23,420
How do I fucking do that?

2968
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,560
How do I control it?

2969
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:30,240
I'm so confused.

2970
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:31,980
Oh shit.

2971
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:34,920
How do I...

2972
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:37,100
But how do I control it?

2973
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:38,260
Fucking hell no!

2974
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:38,680
How do I...

2975
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:41,100
Switch.

2976
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:42,140
Oh, I have to select it?

2977
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:42,900
Oh!

2978
02:13:44,260 --> 02:13:44,600
Okay.

2979
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:47,020
My experiment.

2980
02:13:52,360 --> 02:13:53,400
Oh shit, okay.

2981
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:54,920
This is a lot harder.

2982
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:55,440
Give me a...

2983
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:56,420
Give me a sec.

2984
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:58,580
This is actually... I need to charge it?

2985
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:04,580
Thank you for the super chat.

2986
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:05,460
Thank you, thank you.

2987
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:06,740
World's greatest detective.

2988
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:07,560
Also Batman.

2989
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:08,980
Just one more trip to Asylum.

2990
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:10,280
It'll work this time, I swear.

2991
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:12,020
Okay.

2992
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:13,100
Okay, here we go.

2993
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:13,920
Alright.

2994
02:14:19,580 --> 02:14:20,840
Okay, that's pretty funny.

2995
02:14:20,980 --> 02:14:22,180
I'm just gonna chuck this.

2996
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:22,720
I don't...

2997
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:24,780
I'm just gonna chuck this.

2998
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,880
And then I want... It'll eventually die.

2999
02:14:32,020 --> 02:14:34,120
Fuck this one guy in particular.

3000
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:35,500
Wait, can I actually kill him?

3001
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:36,960
There's no way.

3002
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:39,320
Okay, no way.

3003
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:40,080
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

3004
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:41,560
Alright.

3005
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:46,680
There we go.

3006
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:49,820
Alright, I'm just gonna fucking kill him.

3007
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:50,800
Yeah!

3008
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:54,180
Boop!

3009
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:55,480
There we go.

3010
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:57,820
Okay, how do I throw you?

3011
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:58,960
I need to throw you.

3012
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:00,600
Please!

3013
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:02,320
I need to throw you!

3014
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:04,400
Let me throw you!

3015
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:06,960
No!

3016
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:08,620
It won't let me throw you!

3017
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:11,250
Ow.

3018
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:14,010
Okay, nice.

3019
02:15:15,110 --> 02:15:15,590
Alright.

3020
02:15:16,330 --> 02:15:17,190
Get over here.

3021
02:15:17,350 --> 02:15:19,430
Give me that free fucking juicy XP.

3022
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:21,910
I didn't eight combo?

3023
02:15:22,270 --> 02:15:23,070
Oh my god.

3024
02:15:23,150 --> 02:15:23,310
Alright.

3025
02:15:24,070 --> 02:15:25,050
Don't worry, I'm getting it.

3026
02:15:25,170 --> 02:15:25,550
Yes!

3027
02:15:25,930 --> 02:15:26,410
Yes!

3028
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:27,810
Let me throw!

3029
02:15:28,270 --> 02:15:28,750
Yes!

3030
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:33,150
Alright, now I'll never do that again.

3031
02:15:33,150 --> 02:15:34,570
That aim!

3032
02:15:34,690 --> 02:15:35,330
Thank you!

3033
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:37,030
It's a great aim right there.

3034
02:15:37,230 --> 02:15:38,350
Thank you, the super chat!

3035
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:39,350
Thank you, thank you!

3036
02:15:41,650 --> 02:15:42,210
Nice.

3037
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:46,430
I'll never have to throw again after that.

3038
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:49,830
Use the bat, bat.

3039
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:51,910
Alright, easy.

3040
02:15:52,690 --> 02:15:53,830
Oh yeah, that was easy.

3041
02:15:55,670 --> 02:15:56,230
Okay.

3042
02:15:56,230 --> 02:15:56,790
Let's...

3043
02:15:57,550 --> 02:15:58,670
Let's grab...

3044
02:15:58,670 --> 02:16:00,530
the Riddler thing here.

3045
02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:01,270
I need that XP.

3046
02:16:02,270 --> 02:16:03,130
I need that XP.

3047
02:16:03,130 --> 02:16:04,790
More wheelchairs.

3048
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:07,910
Alright.

3049
02:16:08,070 --> 02:16:08,590
Give me.

3050
02:16:10,510 --> 02:16:11,070
Give me.

3051
02:16:13,630 --> 02:16:14,070
Okay.

3052
02:16:14,170 --> 02:16:14,810
Let's see.

3053
02:16:14,910 --> 02:16:16,050
I need to make sure...

3054
02:16:16,050 --> 02:16:16,770
Alright.

3055
02:16:16,890 --> 02:16:18,530
What was up this riddle?

3056
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:19,590
Oh, hey, teeth.

3057
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:20,990
Teeth.

3058
02:16:22,150 --> 02:16:24,010
Alright, what's the answer to this riddle, guys?

3059
02:16:24,230 --> 02:16:24,950
Riddle me this.

3060
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:29,430
So many, like, areas to...

3061
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:34,500
Alright, open.

3062
02:16:39,030 --> 02:16:39,690
What's this?

3063
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:40,630
Oh, another tape.

3064
02:16:54,090 --> 02:16:54,610
Whoa!

3065
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:10,880
Oh, he's doing his own interview?

3066
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:14,200
Oh!

3067
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:15,300
What a plot twist.

3068
02:17:24,730 --> 02:17:26,750
Oh, that was the scarecrow!

3069
02:17:28,150 --> 02:17:30,390
Okay, it's still underneath the statue?

3070
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:31,530
What does that even mean?

3071
02:17:32,390 --> 02:17:33,870
Oh my god, look at all these bodies.

3072
02:17:35,810 --> 02:17:38,730
Also, like, it's not great that they passed out, too.

3073
02:17:39,350 --> 02:17:40,970
That just means, like...

3074
02:17:41,570 --> 02:17:43,190
Like, it's, like, even worse.

3075
02:17:44,390 --> 02:17:45,550
Okay, no, not that.

3076
02:17:46,510 --> 02:17:47,490
No, not that.

3077
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:49,670
No, not him.

3078
02:17:50,610 --> 02:17:51,770
That's a gargoyle?

3079
02:17:55,590 --> 02:17:57,150
I'll never figure out.

3080
02:17:57,370 --> 02:17:59,210
I'll never figure it out, apparently.

3081
02:18:02,050 --> 02:18:02,690
Let's see.

3082
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:03,650
Is there anything I'm missing?

3083
02:18:03,730 --> 02:18:03,850
I don't know.

3084
02:18:05,150 --> 02:18:07,710
Just need to make sure I'm not missing anything.

3085
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:09,410
Ah, shit, more TVs.

3086
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:13,810
Left?

3087
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:15,970
The west wing.

3088
02:18:16,210 --> 02:18:16,950
Nope, not that.

3089
02:18:17,310 --> 02:18:18,550
Wait, there's a scare up there.

3090
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:19,310
Nope, not that.

3091
02:18:20,430 --> 02:18:21,270
Density unknown?

3092
02:18:21,410 --> 02:18:22,190
Nope, not that.

3093
02:18:23,650 --> 02:18:24,930
It's in the side hall.

3094
02:18:25,390 --> 02:18:27,110
The fuck is a side hall?

3095
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:32,930
What the fuck is a side hall?

3096
02:18:33,910 --> 02:18:35,090
This hall wing?

3097
02:18:36,330 --> 02:18:37,370
Did you see it?

3098
02:18:39,890 --> 02:18:41,350
I'm just gonna grab these teeth.

3099
02:18:43,130 --> 02:18:44,770
It's a hall on the side.

3100
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:49,130
Thanks, guys.

3101
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:52,930
Oh my god, this fucking tooth.

3102
02:18:54,270 --> 02:18:55,050
Alright, nice.

3103
02:18:55,390 --> 02:18:56,570
Can I just open this door?

3104
02:18:56,910 --> 02:18:57,510
That's it?

3105
02:18:57,790 --> 02:18:58,870
It's just for the teeth?

3106
02:19:00,110 --> 02:19:00,970
Let's see.

3107
02:19:03,410 --> 02:19:05,270
Where do I go from here?

3108
02:19:06,890 --> 02:19:09,170
I can't get through from here.

3109
02:19:10,310 --> 02:19:12,230
Because all the area is locked.

3110
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:14,430
Huh.

3111
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:21,660
Where the fuck do I go?

3112
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:27,210
Straight ahead to the left?

3113
02:19:27,970 --> 02:19:29,410
Wait, okay, what's the map?

3114
02:19:29,850 --> 02:19:30,790
Oh, there's a door!

3115
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:32,430
Wait, there's a door right here.

3116
02:19:34,910 --> 02:19:35,990
I can open doors.

3117
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:37,390
Oh, there it is!

3118
02:19:37,410 --> 02:19:38,070
The side hall!

3119
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:42,970
Arrest recognition award for your outstanding contribution.

3120
02:19:43,550 --> 02:19:46,910
Well, to be fair, if they keep getting out, you can always keep arresting.

3121
02:19:47,650 --> 02:19:48,990
Like if you think about it.

3122
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:50,650
Easy, isn't it?

3123
02:19:51,170 --> 02:19:52,130
Well, we'll see.

3124
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:54,150
We'll see.

3125
02:19:57,800 --> 02:19:59,180
Oh my god, we found it.

3126
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:00,420
It was the hall on the side.

3127
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:03,040
What does a bird need in the rain?

3128
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:03,880
I don't know.

3129
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:04,620
Okay.

3130
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:06,480
Cover?

3131
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:11,040
Let me make sure that...

3132
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:13,440
Alright, there is one person here.

3133
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:15,860
An umbrella.

3134
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:20,100
I mean, everybody needs an umbrella.

3135
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:21,560
Why is it just a bird?

3136
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:23,240
Boop.

3137
02:20:24,580 --> 02:20:26,160
Destroyed five joker teeth.

3138
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:27,880
I'm pretty sure I destroyed more.

3139
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:31,860
Aim and throw well-being scene when you're in the corner cover.

3140
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:33,720
Okay, watch this.

3141
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:33,860
Okay.

3142
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:34,960
Maybe he knew what was coming.

3143
02:20:35,740 --> 02:20:36,260
Maybe...

3144
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:36,860
Watch this.

3145
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:38,980
The third has brought someone in to deal with it.

3146
02:20:39,180 --> 02:20:39,940
Watch this.

3147
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:41,900
...I don't mean a talk.

3148
02:20:41,980 --> 02:20:42,980
Would have been fun.

3149
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:48,900
Give me a sec.

3150
02:20:49,380 --> 02:20:49,640
Okay.

3151
02:20:52,540 --> 02:20:54,240
Oh, it's a penguin!

3152
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:57,300
Riddle me this.

3153
02:20:57,660 --> 02:20:58,960
I totally knew that.

3154
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:02,140
No!

3155
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,760
I got the gun!

3156
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:20,840
I got the gun!

3157
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:23,760
It's okay, I got the gun guys.

3158
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:26,420
It's okay, he's not gonna pick up the gun.

3159
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:27,800
He's not smart enough for that.

3160
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:32,160
He's not smart enough.

3161
02:21:32,980 --> 02:21:34,840
It was so close!

3162
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:36,280
What do you mean?

3163
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:39,080
I almost got it!

3164
02:21:42,220 --> 02:21:44,020
Thank you for the super chat.

3165
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:45,000
Thank you, thank you.

3166
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:51,560
If Doki got hit with the Scarecoast Nightmare Gas, she could hallucinate a giant map.

3167
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:53,480
Thank you for the super chat.

3168
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:54,580
Thank you, thank you.

3169
02:21:54,700 --> 02:21:56,540
How was I supposed to know?

3170
02:21:58,660 --> 02:21:59,360
Okay.

3171
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:01,140
I'll paint that.

3172
02:22:05,610 --> 02:22:06,310
Nice.

3173
02:22:07,050 --> 02:22:08,010
What's in here?

3174
02:22:08,550 --> 02:22:09,590
Oh, it's just this.

3175
02:22:10,350 --> 02:22:11,830
It's another chronicle.

3176
02:22:35,070 --> 02:22:39,950
Yeah, I was gonna say, whenever they're like, I'm eager to see my family, they're never alive.

3177
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:43,470
Poor guy, he lost his family.

3178
02:22:46,270 --> 02:22:47,290
Oh hey, what's this?

3179
02:22:49,430 --> 02:22:52,470
Alright, pull that down.

3180
02:22:52,690 --> 02:22:53,710
Pull that down.

3181
02:22:56,430 --> 02:22:57,830
It's in one of the cases?

3182
02:22:57,830 --> 02:23:00,290
Where the fuck is the umbrella?

3183
02:23:02,030 --> 02:23:03,190
Is it... no?

3184
02:23:05,070 --> 02:23:06,290
Where's the umbrella?

3185
02:23:07,450 --> 02:23:09,470
Okay, that's not an umbrella.

3186
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:12,310
Where the fuck is the umbrella?

3187
02:23:13,110 --> 02:23:14,330
Oh, there it is!

3188
02:23:15,250 --> 02:23:17,390
Shit, that's a lot of umbrellas.

3189
02:23:17,990 --> 02:23:18,670
Nice.

3190
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:21,130
Riddle solved.

3191
02:23:22,890 --> 02:23:23,910
The Penguin.

3192
02:23:24,250 --> 02:23:26,170
One of Batman's oldest foes.

3193
02:23:26,170 --> 02:23:28,110
Is an eccentric criminal mastermind.

3194
02:23:28,250 --> 02:23:32,290
Known as much for his love of ornithology and trick umbrellas.

3195
02:23:32,290 --> 02:23:33,910
As for shady business dealings.

3196
02:23:34,090 --> 02:23:40,190
Gotham's popular Iceberg Lounge serves as Cobblepot's front for a number of illegal financial activities.

3197
02:23:40,510 --> 02:23:42,430
That fund much of the city's underworld.

3198
02:23:42,790 --> 02:23:49,570
Despite his short stature, the Penguin is a wildly foe whose umbrellas conceal a variety of deadly weapons and gadgets.

3199
02:23:49,990 --> 02:23:52,150
Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.

3200
02:23:52,450 --> 02:23:54,630
I like how this one's not a professional criminal.

3201
02:23:54,630 --> 02:23:56,990
He's just like a restaurant owner.

3202
02:24:00,730 --> 02:24:01,910
No big deal.

3203
02:24:02,230 --> 02:24:03,190
He's just...

3204
02:24:03,190 --> 02:24:07,010
Okay, that is... there's no way he's 5'2".

3205
02:24:07,010 --> 02:24:08,890
I'm 5'2".

3206
02:24:08,890 --> 02:24:12,390
There's no fucking... he's lying about his height.

3207
02:24:12,850 --> 02:24:14,190
There's no way.

3208
02:24:14,590 --> 02:24:17,750
Because if Batman is 6 feet...

3209
02:24:17,750 --> 02:24:18,950
You think about it.

3210
02:24:19,010 --> 02:24:19,750
Okay, Bruce Wayne.

3211
02:24:19,810 --> 02:24:20,510
Where's Bruce Wayne?

3212
02:24:20,750 --> 02:24:22,870
Where the fuck is Bruce Wayne?

3213
02:24:24,630 --> 02:24:26,050
I refuse to...

3214
02:24:26,510 --> 02:24:28,330
There's no fucking way.

3215
02:24:29,230 --> 02:24:31,070
Bruce Wayne is 6'2".

3216
02:24:31,070 --> 02:24:33,730
Okay, if you imagine 5'2".

3217
02:24:33,730 --> 02:24:36,070
Like, it's not like... okay.

3218
02:24:37,630 --> 02:24:39,290
Oh, it counts the top hat?

3219
02:24:39,510 --> 02:24:39,910
Okay.

3220
02:24:41,190 --> 02:24:42,910
That makes more sense now.

3221
02:24:43,150 --> 02:24:45,230
Because I was like, there's no fucking way.

3222
02:24:45,430 --> 02:24:47,610
This guy is 5'2".

3223
02:24:47,610 --> 02:24:50,110
When like, every time you put him next to the...

3224
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:52,310
Penguin... like, if you put him next to the Batman.

3225
02:24:52,310 --> 02:24:56,490
He's like... he reaches his like, Batman's crouch or something.

3226
02:24:56,710 --> 02:24:58,710
And I'm like, there's no fucking way.

3227
02:24:58,890 --> 02:25:01,930
A 5'2 prince will feel like that short.

3228
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:05,890
You guys are like...

3229
02:25:05,890 --> 02:25:09,310
Doki, that's some sick copium right now.

3230
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:16,590
I refuse to believe that that's a 5'2".

3231
02:25:19,810 --> 02:25:21,510
There's no fucking way.

3232
02:25:22,390 --> 02:25:24,250
I refuse to believe it.

3233
02:25:24,350 --> 02:25:25,810
That's just too sad.

3234
02:25:26,810 --> 02:25:27,770
Oh, hey guys.

3235
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:30,770
Let me go back outside.

3236
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:34,370
Doki, go.

3237
02:25:36,610 --> 02:25:38,490
Why is it up here?

3238
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:41,030
I'm like, trying to think.

3239
02:25:41,150 --> 02:25:42,490
Okay, I'm just gonna beat people up here.

3240
02:25:42,570 --> 02:25:44,650
Wait, I'm just gonna make sure there's no...

3241
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:45,410
Um...

3242
02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:46,210
What?

3243
02:25:46,730 --> 02:25:48,170
Oh, I have to open the door.

3244
02:25:48,410 --> 02:25:49,770
I wanna make sure there's no guns.

3245
02:25:49,810 --> 02:25:50,330
No guns?

3246
02:25:51,350 --> 02:25:52,030
No guns.

3247
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:52,670
Okay.

3248
02:25:53,330 --> 02:25:54,290
Well, I don't really care.

3249
02:25:54,350 --> 02:25:55,150
I'm just gonna beat them up.

3250
02:25:56,030 --> 02:25:56,470
Yeah!

3251
02:25:58,730 --> 02:25:59,450
Oh shit.

3252
02:26:00,610 --> 02:26:01,910
I really don't care.

3253
02:26:06,250 --> 02:26:06,690
Okay.

3254
02:26:07,190 --> 02:26:08,010
Oh shit!

3255
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:08,870
There's so many people!

3256
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:12,490
It's okay.

3257
02:26:12,610 --> 02:26:13,070
I'm good.

3258
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:16,710
Nice.

3259
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:17,110
You're all stunned.

3260
02:26:18,750 --> 02:26:19,210
No!

3261
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:19,650
Counter!

3262
02:26:22,890 --> 02:26:23,490
Okay, stunned.

3263
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:24,890
Nice.

3264
02:26:25,570 --> 02:26:28,330
If all else fails, just keep pressing X.

3265
02:26:28,770 --> 02:26:30,070
And sometimes Y.

3266
02:26:31,910 --> 02:26:33,810
Six and Black, thank you for the super chat.

3267
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:34,670
Thank you, thank you.

3268
02:26:35,170 --> 02:26:36,830
Oh no, I got... made him back up.

3269
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:43,590
Who needs stealth when I can just stealth them with my fists?

3270
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:47,590
You can just stroll downstairs and save the helpless hostages.

3271
02:26:48,050 --> 02:26:48,650
Right?

3272
02:26:48,810 --> 02:26:50,130
There's hostages here?

3273
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:51,430
Oh shit!

3274
02:26:55,150 --> 02:26:57,830
That's clearly not caring about that.

3275
02:26:59,310 --> 02:27:01,630
Thank you for the super chat.

3276
02:27:01,770 --> 02:27:03,110
Thank you, thank you.

3277
02:27:03,110 --> 02:27:06,570
I didn't know Burnt Doki comes in penguin size.

3278
02:27:06,870 --> 02:27:13,530
The only way I could have made that one easier to find is if I strapped into the hood of that ludicrously ostentatious beast.

3279
02:27:16,230 --> 02:27:16,830
I'm not sure if that's the right word.

3280
02:27:16,830 --> 02:27:21,350
Alright, let's make sure that there's no other criminals around.

3281
02:27:25,410 --> 02:27:26,790
That's what I'm saying!

3282
02:27:27,150 --> 02:27:28,510
That's why I'm like, there's no way...

3283
02:27:28,970 --> 02:27:31,050
There's no way Penguin is five foot two.

3284
02:27:31,270 --> 02:27:33,590
He's lying about his fucking height.

3285
02:27:35,910 --> 02:27:37,370
I'm basically correct!

3286
02:27:41,860 --> 02:27:42,460
Okay.

3287
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:44,480
Oh, okay.

3288
02:27:44,540 --> 02:27:46,740
I was like, I'm gonna cut the chandelier.

3289
02:27:47,780 --> 02:27:49,420
Why don't they cut the chandelier?

3290
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:03,260
Oh shit, two minutes?

3291
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:05,260
Wait, does it count?

3292
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:09,040
Let's try to figure out how to do the chandelier!

3293
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:12,020
Oh god.

3294
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:14,400
Oh god, don't do well under pressure, Joker!

3295
02:28:14,400 --> 02:28:14,620
Joker!

3296
02:28:15,580 --> 02:28:17,240
Never do well under pressure!

3297
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:18,560
Oh god.

3298
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:19,500
Oh god!

3299
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:23,640
Oh god, okay.

3300
02:28:23,860 --> 02:28:25,440
Okay, I need to be in detective mode.

3301
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:27,060
I can think better.

3302
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:33,380
I don't even know if it's time yet!

3303
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:34,880
What do I do?

3304
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:36,960
Cutting!

3305
02:28:37,300 --> 02:28:37,780
Cut!

3306
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:43,920
Gotta say, I'm getting bored already.

3307
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:46,100
Maybe I should just pass the buck.

3308
02:28:46,860 --> 02:28:47,340
Boo.

3309
02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:48,820
What do I do?

3310
02:28:48,820 --> 02:28:49,980
I'll be joking.

3311
02:28:51,460 --> 02:28:55,330
What do I do?

3312
02:28:55,430 --> 02:28:56,170
Oh, there it is!

3313
02:28:57,530 --> 02:28:57,970
Open.

3314
02:28:58,070 --> 02:28:59,650
Do not open before... Okay.

3315
02:29:06,140 --> 02:29:07,000
Thank you, Batman.

3316
02:29:07,180 --> 02:29:08,120
Are they all gone?

3317
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:10,480
Yes, you're safe.

3318
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:11,640
What happened?

3319
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:13,520
It all happened so fast.

3320
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:18,120
Some patients broke in, began tearing up the place, like they were looking for something.

3321
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:20,100
Bill here fought back, but there were too many.

3322
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:21,440
They took Dr. Young.

3323
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:23,540
She rushed in here and they followed.

3324
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:24,660
I'm sorry.

3325
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:27,080
When I came to, we were all tied up.

3326
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:28,360
Doc Young was gone.

3327
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:29,840
You're not a doctor, you're a guard!

3328
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:34,020
Factory, thank you for the super chat.

3329
02:29:34,060 --> 02:29:34,940
Thank you, thank you.

3330
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:36,500
Thanks for the fun stream and funny moments.

3331
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:37,400
Keep your head up, Doki.

3332
02:29:37,440 --> 02:29:37,920
Thank you!

3333
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:38,640
Thank you for the super chat.

3334
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:39,520
Thank you, thank you!

3335
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:40,660
I'm glad you've been enjoying the stream!

3336
02:29:41,260 --> 02:29:41,900
Oh my god.

3337
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:42,480
Alright, guys.

3338
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:43,140
I need help.

3339
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:45,080
How do I solve... Riddle me this.

3340
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:46,240
How do I solve this?

3341
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:49,940
It was like something out of thin air.

3342
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:51,660
Riddle me this.

3343
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:53,740
What the fuck does that mean?

3344
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:01,080
Do not open before April 1st.

3345
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:02,260
Love, Joker.

3346
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:03,640
No clue.

3347
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:06,420
There's a book.

3348
02:30:07,380 --> 02:30:08,840
There's so many books.

3349
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:11,140
Whoa!

3350
02:30:11,320 --> 02:30:11,960
Maybe this?

3351
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:15,380
Open door?

3352
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:18,060
No, that's where I came from.

3353
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:21,120
This Finnish puzzle.

3354
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:22,700
The library.

3355
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:23,420
Oh, wait!

3356
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:24,540
There's no puzzle here.

3357
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:26,600
Look at the map.

3358
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:27,060
Oops.

3359
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:30,200
This?

3360
02:30:30,580 --> 02:30:32,580
Oh, there's a sitting... Wait.

3361
02:30:32,740 --> 02:30:35,080
Did I go in that hidden room yet?

3362
02:30:39,030 --> 02:30:39,690
Can't tell.

3363
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:46,780
There's a book in the library.

3364
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:49,440
There is?

3365
02:30:50,980 --> 02:30:52,400
I think it has to be above.

3366
02:30:56,220 --> 02:30:56,820
Oh, hey.

3367
02:30:56,860 --> 02:30:57,780
There's another... Wait.

3368
02:30:57,820 --> 02:30:58,380
I didn't see this.

3369
02:30:58,380 --> 02:30:59,460
What's this?

3370
02:31:04,470 --> 02:31:06,790
Oh, in the previous room.

3371
02:31:06,870 --> 02:31:07,070
It's okay.

3372
02:31:07,170 --> 02:31:07,890
I needed this anyway.

3373
02:31:08,350 --> 02:31:09,790
I need the riddler trophy.

3374
02:31:11,190 --> 02:31:11,810
Alright.

3375
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:13,070
Down I go.

3376
02:31:14,830 --> 02:31:15,450
Alright.

3377
02:31:15,990 --> 02:31:16,610
Goodbye.

3378
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:18,210
Goodbye.

3379
02:31:18,930 --> 02:31:19,550
Okay.

3380
02:31:19,610 --> 02:31:21,570
Where is the door?

3381
02:31:21,650 --> 02:31:21,990
Fuck.

3382
02:31:24,830 --> 02:31:26,630
I'm so fucking lost.

3383
02:31:27,230 --> 02:31:28,370
I'm so...

3384
02:31:28,370 --> 02:31:30,490
There's two riddles in here?

3385
02:31:33,870 --> 02:31:34,830
Joker... riddler!

3386
02:31:35,950 --> 02:31:38,210
Why did mom let you have two riddles?

3387
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:43,420
There is?

3388
02:31:45,160 --> 02:31:46,440
There's no book here.

3389
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:48,300
Readings for losers.

3390
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:51,020
What?

3391
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:53,300
Where the fuck is the book?

3392
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:57,460
I'm gonna go up here just in case.

3393
02:31:58,600 --> 02:32:00,080
Look to my left.

3394
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:08,540
Guys, don't you guys remember that like... I don't know my left and my right?

3395
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:10,160
There is a question mark.

3396
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:10,920
Fuck.

3397
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:11,280
Okay.

3398
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:12,640
Okay.

3399
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:14,620
Okay.

3400
02:32:16,580 --> 02:32:18,480
This is a little embarrassing.

3401
02:32:19,780 --> 02:32:20,300
Oh!

3402
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:21,520
There it is!

3403
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:28,440
Okay.

3404
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:28,960
Alright.

3405
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:29,540
Let's see.

3406
02:32:30,260 --> 02:32:31,880
I must be able to...

3407
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:33,320
Alright.

3408
02:32:39,930 --> 02:32:40,410
Oh!

3409
02:32:40,430 --> 02:32:40,670
Oh!

3410
02:32:40,670 --> 02:32:40,670
Fuck!

3411
02:32:40,770 --> 02:32:41,310
Not the floor!

3412
02:32:45,340 --> 02:32:45,820
Wait.

3413
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:46,760
It doesn't matter?

3414
02:32:48,740 --> 02:32:49,660
What do you mean perspective?

3415
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:53,820
Like this?

3416
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:55,040
Oh!

3417
02:32:57,380 --> 02:32:58,720
What the fuck do you mean?

3418
02:33:02,070 --> 02:33:04,230
Grapple on the vent and do the perspective.

3419
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:05,990
Alright.

3420
02:33:06,190 --> 02:33:06,970
We got this.

3421
02:33:08,530 --> 02:33:09,230
Like that?

3422
02:33:10,930 --> 02:33:11,810
That's not a line.

3423
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:14,070
What the fuck?

3424
02:33:15,630 --> 02:33:16,570
Go higher?

3425
02:33:16,830 --> 02:33:18,430
I'm already as high as I can be.

3426
02:33:21,540 --> 02:33:22,100
Okay.

3427
02:33:22,180 --> 02:33:22,740
Maybe...

3428
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:26,000
God damn it!

3429
02:33:26,420 --> 02:33:26,980
Sorry.

3430
02:33:27,180 --> 02:33:28,100
I'm too stupid for this.

3431
02:33:29,360 --> 02:33:30,720
Are you fucking...

3432
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:33,080
Are you fucking serious?

3433
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:35,640
There's a dot next to my feet.

3434
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:37,680
There's a dot next to my...

3435
02:33:42,090 --> 02:33:42,650
Oh!

3436
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:43,730
Oh!

3437
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:48,900
I figured it out.

3438
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:54,220
It's like I'm standing it this entire time.

3439
02:33:54,680 --> 02:33:55,980
Oh my god.

3440
02:33:56,140 --> 02:33:59,680
I didn't realize I was standing on the fucking dot.

3441
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:03,140
I was like what the fuck do you mean there's a dot next to my feet?

3442
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:04,400
I'm... Whoa!

3443
02:34:05,740 --> 02:34:06,420
Yes.

3444
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:07,280
XP time.

3445
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:10,620
Thanks Joker for sending me more experience points.

3446
02:34:11,860 --> 02:34:12,540
Boom.

3447
02:34:13,700 --> 02:34:14,620
Concussion time.

3448
02:34:15,800 --> 02:34:18,860
World's greatest detective by the way.

3449
02:34:19,700 --> 02:34:20,820
That's me!

3450
02:34:24,260 --> 02:34:25,460
That's me guys.

3451
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:26,700
Do you guys know?

3452
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:29,720
I am the world's greatest detective.

3453
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:35,240
I'm just wondering...

3454
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:37,520
Where do I go now?

3455
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:39,540
Because like this door is still locked.

3456
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:42,520
Biggie.

3457
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:43,480
Biggest brain moment.

3458
02:34:45,060 --> 02:34:46,940
Go back to the library?

3459
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:48,780
Where's the library?

3460
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:53,860
Did I go back?

3461
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:55,580
Did I went the wrong way?

3462
02:34:56,540 --> 02:34:58,420
Please don't tell me they're back already.

3463
02:34:59,260 --> 02:35:00,620
The south corridor.

3464
02:35:04,570 --> 02:35:05,710
There's another door?

3465
02:35:06,290 --> 02:35:07,850
How did I miss the other door?

3466
02:35:08,650 --> 02:35:09,450
Oh wait.

3467
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:10,310
Because I'm blind.

3468
02:35:13,250 --> 02:35:13,850
That's it.

3469
02:35:15,790 --> 02:35:16,390
That's it.

3470
02:35:16,390 --> 02:35:18,290
Oh there is another door.

3471
02:35:18,390 --> 02:35:18,830
Right here.

3472
02:35:20,670 --> 02:35:21,230
No!

3473
02:35:21,450 --> 02:35:23,070
Stop tagging your signature!

3474
02:35:26,210 --> 02:35:27,010
There you go.

3475
02:35:30,740 --> 02:35:31,620
God damn it.

3476
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:33,260
God damn it.

3477
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:39,040
Just gonna make sure.

3478
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:43,200
Just gonna make sure I don't miss anything.

3479
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:44,640
Wait no.

3480
02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:45,280
I was here.

3481
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:49,420
Batman was here.

3482
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:51,600
Where's the map?

3483
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:54,520
Where did I not go?

3484
02:35:57,060 --> 02:35:58,340
Chat lied.

3485
02:35:58,780 --> 02:36:00,140
God damn it chat!

3486
02:36:00,420 --> 02:36:01,340
Where do I go?

3487
02:36:05,740 --> 02:36:07,400
Oh my god.

3488
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:08,660
God fucking...

3489
02:36:09,180 --> 02:36:10,400
Okay I guess...

3490
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:12,180
I guess I leave?

3491
02:36:14,360 --> 02:36:16,380
Where do we top up the tower?

3492
02:36:18,140 --> 02:36:18,940
Okay.

3493
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:21,160
Don't believe our lies.

3494
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:22,700
Back to the main hall.

3495
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:24,440
God fucking damn it.

3496
02:36:24,520 --> 02:36:24,900
I knew it.

3497
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:26,500
I knew you guys were fucking with me.

3498
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:27,680
I knew it.

3499
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:35,980
Go to the north corridor.

3500
02:36:37,100 --> 02:36:38,540
The main hall.

3501
02:36:39,220 --> 02:36:39,980
Where's north?

3502
02:36:40,580 --> 02:36:41,520
North is up.

3503
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:44,160
North is up.

3504
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:45,460
Is this north?

3505
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,300
Don't believe their truths either?

3506
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:52,400
But there's a door?

3507
02:36:56,130 --> 02:36:57,630
Get over here.

3508
02:36:59,270 --> 02:37:00,210
That's fucking right.

3509
02:37:01,390 --> 02:37:01,830
Bam!

3510
02:37:05,030 --> 02:37:05,470
Nice.

3511
02:37:06,910 --> 02:37:07,350
What?

3512
02:37:08,970 --> 02:37:09,610
Wait what?

3513
02:37:10,770 --> 02:37:11,850
What's that collar do?

3514
02:37:12,470 --> 02:37:13,870
Why is it making that noise?

3515
02:37:14,350 --> 02:37:15,710
It's the suicide collar.

3516
02:37:15,910 --> 02:37:16,990
But it sounds weird.

3517
02:37:17,890 --> 02:37:18,750
Suicide collar?

3518
02:37:18,930 --> 02:37:19,150
What?

3519
02:37:19,250 --> 02:37:23,250
Well they've got some other name but well we just use them to monitor patients heartbeats.

3520
02:37:23,310 --> 02:37:26,450
If it drops too low the alarm goes off and a crash team rushes in.

3521
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:27,910
Wait I killed?

3522
02:37:29,910 --> 02:37:30,470
What's that?

3523
02:37:30,470 --> 02:37:31,170
How do you like that?

3524
02:37:31,430 --> 02:37:31,990
Apple's bath?

3525
02:37:32,650 --> 02:37:34,290
Standing around in the...

3526
02:37:34,290 --> 02:37:35,990
Let's see...

3527
02:37:35,990 --> 02:37:38,450
Ah, the west wing...

3528
02:37:38,450 --> 02:37:39,990
Oh this is definitely not north.

3529
02:37:40,090 --> 02:37:43,530
They'd be here now if they weren't busy knocking a little cents into cash.

3530
02:37:44,050 --> 02:37:45,130
I'll tell you what.

3531
02:37:45,210 --> 02:37:48,670
I won't spoil the surprise and let them know you're coming.

3532
02:37:48,750 --> 02:37:49,330
Wait did I kill?

3533
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:51,150
Did I kill?

3534
02:37:51,930 --> 02:37:52,770
Oh hey upgrade.

3535
02:37:53,610 --> 02:37:54,170
Alright.

3536
02:37:54,710 --> 02:37:56,110
It's upgrade time guys.

3537
02:37:57,290 --> 02:37:58,270
What are we getting?

3538
02:37:58,690 --> 02:37:59,250
I think it's a box.

3539
02:37:59,250 --> 02:38:04,370
Alright, I am never... guys, all I know is that...

3540
02:38:05,330 --> 02:38:10,450
is that it was a mistake to listen to you guys when you said remote BATTERAD.

3541
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:15,390
Oh wait, no upgrades, never mind.

3542
02:38:15,830 --> 02:38:22,110
All I'm saying was that the remote BATTERAD was not helpful.

3543
02:38:27,230 --> 02:38:29,910
It's not because I can't aim, alright?

3544
02:38:30,110 --> 02:38:31,390
I'm just gonna let you guys know.

3545
02:38:31,610 --> 02:38:33,970
It's not because it was me.

3546
02:38:34,370 --> 02:38:36,230
It's not a me issue, okay?

3547
02:38:36,670 --> 02:38:39,390
It is... it is not a me issue.

3548
02:38:39,710 --> 02:38:40,890
I just want you guys to know that.

3549
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:46,730
It is not a skill issue!

3550
02:38:47,470 --> 02:38:48,410
I don't know why...

3551
02:38:49,230 --> 02:38:51,690
It says like a structural weak... oh wait, look.

3552
02:38:52,410 --> 02:38:54,250
Security, okay I can't get there yet.

3553
02:38:54,430 --> 02:38:56,070
And I can't do that yet either.

3554
02:38:58,690 --> 02:39:00,050
I guess I'll open the door?

3555
02:39:00,370 --> 02:39:00,770
Oh!

3556
02:39:01,130 --> 02:39:04,310
That's a lot of... that's a lot of guns.

3557
02:39:06,710 --> 02:39:07,830
Can I?

3558
02:39:08,830 --> 02:39:09,390
Boop!

3559
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:10,370
Hello.

3560
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:17,720
Boop!

3561
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:21,960
Oh, I guess like... it can be used to...

3562
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:23,540
Uh...

3563
02:39:26,220 --> 02:39:27,040
Come on, come on, come on.

3564
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:27,460
No!

3565
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:28,420
It was so close!

3566
02:39:28,900 --> 02:39:30,820
What if I just do this and then I...

3567
02:39:31,540 --> 02:39:32,060
Oh.

3568
02:39:32,300 --> 02:39:32,720
Oh.

3569
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:34,360
Okay.

3570
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:38,280
Oh, that's awkward.

3571
02:39:38,940 --> 02:39:40,480
That is so awkward.

3572
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:42,460
That is so awkward.

3573
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,180
Alright, come over here.

3574
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:48,020
Come over here.

3575
02:39:51,980 --> 02:39:52,740
Come on!

3576
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:55,940
Okay, but what...

3577
02:39:56,860 --> 02:39:57,760
What if...

3578
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:01,660
Oh my god, there's way too many people here.

3579
02:40:02,140 --> 02:40:03,040
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

3580
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:04,040
This is what we do.

3581
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:06,500
There's no way I...

3582
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:06,840
Okay.

3583
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:08,960
Okay.

3584
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:10,820
What did I do?

3585
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:12,380
You still came from over there.

3586
02:40:19,860 --> 02:40:23,000
There's no way I could fuck this up, guys.

3587
02:40:25,060 --> 02:40:25,520
Whooooooa!

3588
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:26,140
Bam!

3589
02:40:26,140 --> 02:40:26,220
Bam!

3590
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:27,300
I told you!

3591
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:30,940
I told you there was no way I could fuck this up!

3592
02:40:33,380 --> 02:40:35,440
I wonder if he can pick up his gun again.

3593
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:38,360
I wanna know if he can pick up his gun.

3594
02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:39,940
Can he pick up his gun?

3595
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:48,440
Okay, let's just go glad kick him.

3596
02:40:49,360 --> 02:40:49,840
Boom.

3597
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:53,280
Okay.

3598
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:54,440
Making sure...

3599
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:55,400
Keep quiet!

3600
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:56,880
Nice.

3601
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:58,200
Whoooooo!

3602
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:00,440
Oh shit!

3603
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:00,740
No way he knows!

3604
02:41:01,460 --> 02:41:02,820
There's no way he knows!

3605
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:06,180
There's no way!

3606
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:10,520
Okay.

3607
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:14,360
Wait!

3608
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:24,920
Maybe it is good!

3609
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:26,160
Oh wait!

3610
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:28,420
I didn't realize I could do get triple kill!

3611
02:41:29,780 --> 02:41:30,420
Whoooooooa!

3612
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:31,320
I didn't realize it was bullying!

3613
02:41:33,880 --> 02:41:37,940
If I knew it was bullying...

3614
02:41:37,940 --> 02:41:46,420
Alright, whoever... whoever fucking suggested the remote control batarang...

3615
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:47,840
You were right.

3616
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:49,040
You were right.

3617
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:50,960
You were right.

3618
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:58,280
Oh boy, a trippa!

3619
02:42:00,780 --> 02:42:01,180
Thanks.

3620
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:03,260
Where did Dr. Young go?

3621
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:04,540
I told her to run.

3622
02:42:04,720 --> 02:42:06,360
These guys came in looking for her.

3623
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:08,220
I told her to go to her office and hide.

3624
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:10,220
Does she keep her records there?

3625
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:11,260
I guess.

3626
02:42:11,500 --> 02:42:13,200
She was pretty desperate to get in there.

3627
02:42:13,360 --> 02:42:14,480
Her office is over there.

3628
02:42:14,820 --> 02:42:16,140
How long ago was this?

3629
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:19,460
I need to find her notes before Joker gets his hands on them.

3630
02:42:19,880 --> 02:42:21,160
20 minutes, maybe more.

3631
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:23,740
I really hate the bat suit that he's wearing.

3632
02:42:23,820 --> 02:42:24,880
His ears are too long!

3633
02:42:26,380 --> 02:42:27,560
Like, I just wanna...

3634
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:29,120
Not a problem.

3635
02:42:29,300 --> 02:42:30,320
I wanna grab a pair of scissors.

3636
02:42:30,420 --> 02:42:31,180
And just cut it.

3637
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:36,120
Okay, investigate Dr. Young's location.

3638
02:42:40,620 --> 02:42:42,440
I just don't like how fucking...

3639
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:44,400
Short... long it is.

3640
02:42:44,460 --> 02:42:46,820
I just wanna grab a pair of scissors and just go snip snip.

3641
02:42:49,980 --> 02:42:50,900
Alright, this way.

3642
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:55,620
It would be better if it was just Mr. Mad.

3643
02:42:59,470 --> 02:43:01,470
Go mad or was he just dizzy?

3644
02:43:01,470 --> 02:43:05,170
Going after the notes yourself, eh, bat?

3645
02:43:05,290 --> 02:43:06,470
That's fucking right, Joker.

3646
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:10,390
I've got a crew working over the daughter as I speak.

3647
02:43:11,850 --> 02:43:14,710
Yeah, but your crew is just like... criminals.

3648
02:43:15,430 --> 02:43:17,790
Like... like the jockeys.

3649
02:43:18,150 --> 02:43:19,210
They're not scientists.

3650
02:43:19,570 --> 02:43:21,030
Not a net, a body of clouds ripping the...

3651
02:43:34,400 --> 02:43:36,300
Never, Joker!

3652
02:43:36,740 --> 02:43:39,800
Because I have too much money to stop now!

3653
02:43:42,140 --> 02:43:44,660
This is literally just my hobby.

3654
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,020
Hey, teeth.

3655
02:43:48,060 --> 02:43:48,620
Nice.

3656
02:43:49,660 --> 02:43:51,140
I only destroyed ten?

3657
02:43:51,300 --> 02:43:53,140
I feel like I destroyed so many.

3658
02:43:57,380 --> 02:43:58,240
Alright, what?

3659
02:43:58,440 --> 02:43:59,100
That's it?

3660
02:43:59,320 --> 02:44:00,040
That's it?

3661
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:00,900
Where'd I go?

3662
02:44:01,580 --> 02:44:03,360
Justin, welcome to Tomato Farm!

3663
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:04,080
Welcome, welcome!

3664
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:06,540
Oh, hey.

3665
02:44:11,440 --> 02:44:12,000
What?

3666
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:16,620
I feel like this is a...

3667
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:18,960
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3668
02:44:19,140 --> 02:44:23,300
Oh, it's him!

3669
02:44:24,980 --> 02:44:25,460
Alright.

3670
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:26,580
Oh, he's a crazy guy.

3671
02:44:26,820 --> 02:44:29,660
Founded the Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the criminally insane.

3672
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:31,400
Naming it after his...

3673
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:33,860
Oh my god, why would you name that after your mom?

3674
02:44:34,760 --> 02:44:35,900
Oh, that's why.

3675
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:38,480
Who he euthanized as treatment for dementia.

3676
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:43,440
Building it on the old grounds of his family historic mansion on the outskirts of California.

3677
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:43,780
Got them.

3678
02:44:44,020 --> 02:44:47,380
Personally treated his first patient, Martin Mad Dog Hawkins.

3679
02:44:47,640 --> 02:44:49,660
But killed the wife and daughter.

3680
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:57,240
After administering fatal electroshock treatment to Hawkins, he lost all grip on his sanity and was admitted into his own institution.

3681
02:45:00,810 --> 02:45:02,130
Oh shit, how tall is he?

3682
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:09,790
The most important information I need to know.

3683
02:45:12,350 --> 02:45:14,090
How tall was he?

3684
02:45:17,610 --> 02:45:18,570
Alright, nice.

3685
02:45:20,550 --> 02:45:21,150
Is it?

3686
02:45:22,470 --> 02:45:23,910
This is where I... Oh wait, no.

3687
02:45:24,030 --> 02:45:24,650
This is...

3688
02:45:25,210 --> 02:45:25,730
different.

3689
02:45:26,290 --> 02:45:28,590
God, there's so many vents and everything.

3690
02:45:29,450 --> 02:45:29,970
Nice.

3691
02:45:30,070 --> 02:45:30,670
Riddle me this.

3692
02:45:33,530 --> 02:45:34,050
Go!

3693
02:45:34,110 --> 02:45:35,190
Welcome to Jemaya Farm!

3694
02:45:35,290 --> 02:45:35,830
Welcome, welcome!

3695
02:45:37,190 --> 02:45:38,470
Alright, down I go.

3696
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:43,660
Too unarmed.

3697
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:46,100
Oh, there he is.

3698
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:47,040
I was like, what the fuck?

3699
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:53,960
And... boop!

3700
02:45:54,740 --> 02:45:55,320
Alright.

3701
02:45:55,560 --> 02:45:57,660
Oh no, let me make sure he doesn't pick up his gun again.

3702
02:45:58,300 --> 02:45:59,560
That's fucking right.

3703
02:45:59,720 --> 02:46:00,380
Dodge this!

3704
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:02,060
My fucking fist!

3705
02:46:03,980 --> 02:46:05,520
I have too much money!

3706
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:08,260
Ow.

3707
02:46:09,160 --> 02:46:11,000
The little fucking...

3708
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:13,420
The little fucking slap.

3709
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:15,840
Nice.

3710
02:46:16,040 --> 02:46:17,440
It was that easy.

3711
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:24,080
Punch it.

3712
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:25,960
Oh my god, wait!

3713
02:46:26,180 --> 02:46:29,580
Okay, but why can't I just blow it up with my fucking...

3714
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:31,700
Bata explosion?

3715
02:46:33,300 --> 02:46:36,600
Like, there's no way it only works on drywall.

3716
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:39,660
That's so fucking stupid.

3717
02:46:39,660 --> 02:46:42,180
Why can't I just blow it up?

3718
02:46:43,140 --> 02:46:45,620
Because it's not that strong.

3719
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:51,120
Fucking weak.

3720
02:46:51,220 --> 02:46:54,620
What's the point of having explosives if they're weak as fuck?

3721
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:57,360
I have so much money!

3722
02:46:58,600 --> 02:47:02,700
It's anti... it is anti-drywall explosion.

3723
02:47:04,380 --> 02:47:05,740
Scan the body?

3724
02:47:06,280 --> 02:47:07,080
Really?

3725
02:47:07,080 --> 02:47:07,160
Really?

3726
02:47:10,570 --> 02:47:12,090
Hey, those bodies don't matter.

3727
02:47:12,610 --> 02:47:14,250
Oh, these bodies?

3728
02:47:18,430 --> 02:47:20,170
That's a cold day in hell when this...

3729
02:47:20,170 --> 02:47:21,450
Oh wait, is that Raul Gull?

3730
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:23,730
That's him?

3731
02:47:24,670 --> 02:47:27,070
Little is known of the early years of the...

3732
02:47:27,070 --> 02:47:28,490
That's your future...

3733
02:47:29,090 --> 02:47:29,610
Uh...

3734
02:47:29,610 --> 02:47:30,950
Father-in-law.

3735
02:47:31,890 --> 02:47:33,950
Whose name means the demon's head.

3736
02:47:34,190 --> 02:47:40,830
But it's known that he has lived for many centuries due to Lazarus Pith's mystical and alchemical bruise that restored his youth.

3737
02:47:40,830 --> 02:47:43,050
A brilliant master of strategy and organization.

3738
02:47:43,770 --> 02:47:50,950
Uh, Raul Gull's goal is to save the Earth from ecological devastation by destroying most of its population.

3739
02:47:51,550 --> 02:47:57,190
He recognized Batman as both a wealthy foe and a possible ally.

3740
02:47:57,590 --> 02:48:01,750
Except that Batman cannot escape his dystopian worldview.

3741
02:48:02,110 --> 02:48:06,110
Batman also shares his love-hate relationship with Raul's daughter.

3742
02:48:07,070 --> 02:48:08,770
The beautiful Talia.

3743
02:48:08,990 --> 02:48:10,090
You know, like...

3744
02:48:10,090 --> 02:48:12,710
I would never understand why Batman is like...

3745
02:48:12,710 --> 02:48:13,270
Ageless.

3746
02:48:13,350 --> 02:48:15,570
But like his robins grow up.

3747
02:48:15,870 --> 02:48:17,250
I find that like...

3748
02:48:17,250 --> 02:48:18,090
Really weird.

3749
02:48:18,290 --> 02:48:18,610
Like...

3750
02:48:18,610 --> 02:48:21,570
Like I understand they don't want him to like...

3751
02:48:21,570 --> 02:48:22,130
Age.

3752
02:48:22,390 --> 02:48:23,850
Because then like...

3753
02:48:23,850 --> 02:48:24,750
Cause he's Batman.

3754
02:48:26,410 --> 02:48:28,190
So they can use him forever.

3755
02:48:28,690 --> 02:48:30,290
But like...

3756
02:48:30,290 --> 02:48:31,070
But like...

3757
02:48:31,070 --> 02:48:33,970
All his like adopted sons and daughters like...

3758
02:48:33,970 --> 02:48:35,010
Age with him.

3759
02:48:35,130 --> 02:48:39,850
And then like at one point Dick Grayson is now like sort of the same age as Batman.

3760
02:48:39,890 --> 02:48:40,070
And then like at one point Dick Grayson is now like sort of the same age as Batman.

3761
02:48:40,090 --> 02:48:41,190
If you think about it.

3762
02:48:41,230 --> 02:48:42,810
Because like if he's like 20...

3763
02:48:42,810 --> 02:48:44,850
If Dick Grayson is like 20 and 30.

3764
02:48:45,110 --> 02:48:47,730
Then how old is fucking Batman at that point?

3765
02:48:47,830 --> 02:48:48,790
He would be like...

3766
02:48:49,410 --> 02:48:50,530
60 or something.

3767
02:48:50,610 --> 02:48:51,310
But he's not.

3768
02:48:56,370 --> 02:48:58,250
Like if you think about it.

3769
02:48:58,630 --> 02:48:59,710
That's why I don't understand.

3770
02:49:00,110 --> 02:49:02,210
I don't understand why like...

3771
02:49:02,210 --> 02:49:03,330
Just don't age.

3772
02:49:04,270 --> 02:49:06,050
But I guess they're like we need more robins.

3773
02:49:06,250 --> 02:49:07,930
We need more robins!

3774
02:49:08,570 --> 02:49:10,070
We can't keep having them!

3775
02:49:10,070 --> 02:49:11,130
We can't keep having Dick as a robin!

3776
02:49:11,390 --> 02:49:12,390
Cause I don't...

3777
02:49:12,390 --> 02:49:13,910
We hate calling him Dick.

3778
02:49:17,420 --> 02:49:19,120
He's been in the pit.

3779
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:21,620
Like it's understandable like Superman's aged this.

3780
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:23,180
Cause he's a fucking alien.

3781
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:33,040
The doctor?

3782
02:49:41,620 --> 02:49:42,840
The surfer Richard?

3783
02:49:43,940 --> 02:49:45,200
Yeah but he's still...

3784
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:46,620
Everyone still calls him fucking Dick.

3785
02:49:51,680 --> 02:49:59,340
It's like he doesn't take the ا for being Desktop...

3786
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:03,850
Here comes the next stop sign.

3787
02:50:03,850 --> 02:50:06,310
Now we have 3 sleep He's sleeping?

3788
02:50:06,310 --> 02:50:06,390
Shut up!

3789
02:50:07,090 --> 02:50:12,590
Shut up!

3790
02:50:12,590 --> 02:50:12,990
Turn if off!

3791
02:50:17,960 --> 02:50:19,320
Push

3792
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:24,900
them all!

3793
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:26,000
Push them all!

3794
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:26,800
Huh?

3795
02:50:27,900 --> 02:50:29,180
What do I have to press?

3796
02:50:29,560 --> 02:50:31,480
Oh, finish this mission first.

3797
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:34,800
I don't know where he wants me to look at.

3798
02:50:35,160 --> 02:50:36,100
The cameras?

3799
02:50:38,380 --> 02:50:39,580
Oh, here.

3800
02:50:39,720 --> 02:50:41,160
Oh, the safety deposit.

3801
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:41,840
Okay.

3802
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:43,040
Whoops.

3803
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:46,280
Whoops.

3804
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:46,880
Scanning.

3805
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:48,040
It has to be here.

3806
02:51:16,390 --> 02:51:17,630
Oh, shit.

3807
02:51:18,290 --> 02:51:19,910
Okay, now I can scan.

3808
02:51:20,350 --> 02:51:20,970
No.

3809
02:51:21,230 --> 02:51:22,690
Now I can scan.

3810
02:51:22,910 --> 02:51:23,370
Nice.

3811
02:51:26,310 --> 02:51:26,930
Yay!

3812
02:51:26,930 --> 02:51:27,550
Whoops.

3813
02:51:29,910 --> 02:51:34,470
Following the suspicious death of this man, his multi-million parents... Oh my god, how many...

3814
02:51:34,470 --> 02:51:35,590
Okay, there's a lot of millionaires.

3815
02:51:35,690 --> 02:51:37,750
But how many millionaires live in fucking Gotham?

3816
02:51:38,610 --> 02:51:39,090
Like...

3817
02:51:43,050 --> 02:51:46,490
Inherited their fortune and then went on to bankrupt their company.

3818
02:51:46,930 --> 02:51:51,130
Saved by a buyout by Bruce Wayne, he came to resent and hate Wayne.

3819
02:51:51,230 --> 02:51:55,270
Oh my god, everyone hates him because he just spends money, I guess.

3820
02:51:55,750 --> 02:52:02,050
Fixated on the concept of masks, he carved one from his family's black coffin and sell it revenge.

3821
02:52:02,090 --> 02:52:07,130
His ensuing battle with the Dark Knight caused him as the...

3822
02:52:07,130 --> 02:52:11,870
Caused his mask to be burnt into his skin, remaking him as the Black Mask.

3823
02:52:12,070 --> 02:52:17,930
He is now a feared gang leader and one of the most powerful mod bosses in Gotham.

3824
02:52:17,970 --> 02:52:20,230
A burning hatred of Batman.

3825
02:52:20,970 --> 02:52:23,490
Bro, like, everybody hates him.

3826
02:52:23,550 --> 02:52:24,590
Get in line!

3827
02:52:27,870 --> 02:52:30,190
Get in fucking line!

3828
02:52:30,190 --> 02:52:32,350
Everyone hates him!

3829
02:52:32,550 --> 02:52:33,690
You're not special!

3830
02:52:34,370 --> 02:52:36,390
I forgot what upgrade you guys wanted.

3831
02:52:37,170 --> 02:52:38,890
What was the upgrade you wanted?

3832
02:52:39,670 --> 02:52:40,790
Wait, his height!

3833
02:52:41,170 --> 02:52:41,530
Wait!

3834
02:52:41,890 --> 02:52:44,010
Doki, you have to look at his height!

3835
02:52:47,410 --> 02:52:49,310
Okay, what do we upgrade first?

3836
02:52:49,510 --> 02:52:50,030
Takedown?

3837
02:52:50,410 --> 02:52:51,570
Instant Takedown?

3838
02:52:51,630 --> 02:52:52,070
Is this it?

3839
02:52:52,690 --> 02:52:54,310
Special Combo Takedown.

3840
02:52:54,390 --> 02:52:55,450
It's not available yet.

3841
02:52:55,690 --> 02:52:57,570
Unless it's in another one.

3842
02:52:57,930 --> 02:52:58,770
Armor upgrade?

3843
02:52:59,050 --> 02:52:59,310
Nope.

3844
02:52:59,310 --> 02:53:00,230
Better at Power.

3845
02:53:01,010 --> 02:53:01,950
Not available.

3846
02:53:03,010 --> 02:53:05,750
Where the fuck is the Instant Takedown?

3847
02:53:06,190 --> 02:53:07,890
Auto Proximity...

3848
02:53:10,250 --> 02:53:11,130
It is?

3849
02:53:12,930 --> 02:53:14,110
Lock in your...

3850
02:53:14,110 --> 02:53:14,530
Oh, is this...

3851
02:53:15,180 --> 02:53:15,470
Takedown...

3852
02:53:15,470 --> 02:53:16,110
Oh!

3853
02:53:17,060 --> 02:53:18,310
Okay, I didn't see that.

3854
02:53:18,550 --> 02:53:18,770
Okay.

3855
02:53:19,510 --> 02:53:20,090
Whoops.

3856
02:53:20,890 --> 02:53:21,470
BNY.

3857
02:53:21,870 --> 02:53:22,750
Alright, nice.

3858
02:53:24,030 --> 02:53:25,610
Okay, now I can open doors.

3859
02:53:27,010 --> 02:53:27,590
No.

3860
02:53:29,310 --> 02:53:30,290
Okay, apparently not.

3861
02:53:30,330 --> 02:53:31,230
Not that we go through.

3862
02:53:32,050 --> 02:53:33,270
Apparently not, guys.

3863
02:53:37,340 --> 02:53:38,760
Where did I come from?

3864
02:53:42,160 --> 02:53:43,880
It's just like, where am I?

3865
02:53:45,540 --> 02:53:46,600
Alright, here we go.

3866
02:53:52,140 --> 02:53:52,920
Alright, don't worry.

3867
02:53:52,980 --> 02:53:55,060
I want to see your faces when I beat the shit out of you.

3868
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:57,420
Bam.

3869
02:53:59,180 --> 02:53:59,720
It's alright.

3870
02:53:59,720 --> 02:54:03,120
I love pressing spamming X.

3871
02:54:03,440 --> 02:54:05,040
It's my favorite part.

3872
02:54:05,780 --> 02:54:07,300
That's fucking right.

3873
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:09,480
You thought you can beat me up?

3874
02:54:09,860 --> 02:54:11,720
You're just goons.

3875
02:54:11,740 --> 02:54:13,360
You're not special.

3876
02:54:14,560 --> 02:54:16,300
You don't even have names.

3877
02:54:17,880 --> 02:54:19,300
Get out of here.

3878
02:54:19,700 --> 02:54:21,160
His height...

3879
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:22,500
We'll never know.

3880
02:54:26,720 --> 02:54:29,060
We'll never know his height.

3881
02:54:29,060 --> 02:54:29,260
Alright.

3882
02:54:30,920 --> 02:54:33,340
It's gonna be a mystery forever.

3883
02:54:38,830 --> 02:54:40,350
Oh, I forgot this one, T.

3884
02:54:40,490 --> 02:54:41,670
Where's the records office?

3885
02:54:43,770 --> 02:54:44,610
This way?

3886
02:54:47,170 --> 02:54:48,130
The tape.

3887
02:54:49,270 --> 02:54:50,130
Go back.

3888
02:54:50,490 --> 02:54:51,710
I missed the tape.

3889
02:54:52,210 --> 02:54:53,410
It wasn't tape.

3890
02:54:53,890 --> 02:54:56,030
I was too busy beating people up.

3891
02:54:57,750 --> 02:54:58,810
Oh, there it is.

3892
02:55:00,370 --> 02:55:00,990
Oh, there it is.

3893
02:55:43,630 --> 02:55:48,670
I feel like Bruce should spend more money on the mental health situation here.

3894
02:55:50,210 --> 02:56:00,110
Is there like a multiverse where Bruce Wayne actually spends his money on fixing the mental health issues in Gotham rather than beating up mentally ill people?

3895
02:56:03,330 --> 02:56:05,770
I didn't think about it.

3896
02:56:11,670 --> 02:56:18,070
I just realized, wouldn't it be better to fund research on like...

3897
02:56:20,350 --> 02:56:23,470
I mean, I feel like he didn't try that hard.

3898
02:56:23,610 --> 02:56:29,250
I feel like beating up people is sort of like the last resort.

3899
02:56:29,730 --> 02:56:31,410
If you think about it.

3900
02:56:32,670 --> 02:56:34,930
I feel like... I don't know.

3901
02:56:35,110 --> 02:56:40,650
It doesn't feel like he tried all that hard to fix the issue.

3902
02:56:50,890 --> 02:56:56,370
You raised more money for mental health in 24 hours than Bruce Wayne did in his whole career.

3903
02:56:56,630 --> 02:56:58,110
Thank you for the super chat.

3904
02:56:58,270 --> 02:56:58,770
Thank you.

3905
02:56:58,830 --> 02:56:59,550
Thank you.

3906
02:57:02,590 --> 02:57:04,190
Prince thank you for the magenta soup.

3907
02:57:04,270 --> 02:57:04,870
Thank you.

3908
02:57:04,870 --> 02:57:05,450
Thank you.

3909
02:57:05,610 --> 02:57:06,410
Hey Toge.

3910
02:57:06,410 --> 02:57:07,970
Glad to see you are enjoying this game.

3911
02:57:08,170 --> 02:57:09,370
I used to play it when I was a kid.

3912
02:57:09,570 --> 02:57:12,910
Can't believe how old it looks now compared to when it came out.

3913
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:14,070
Thanks for the fun stream.

3914
02:57:14,550 --> 02:57:17,970
I recently lost my Oshi and these are keeping me alive.

3915
02:57:18,090 --> 02:57:18,650
Thank you for the money.

3916
02:57:18,650 --> 02:57:20,030
Thank you!

3917
02:57:21,250 --> 02:57:22,950
I'm glad you've been enjoying it.

3918
02:57:24,330 --> 02:57:24,970
Thank you.

3919
02:57:28,280 --> 02:57:30,240
I thought you guys said go to the library.

3920
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:31,480
Is this not the library?

3921
02:57:33,580 --> 02:57:35,260
Is this not the fucking library?

3922
02:57:39,140 --> 02:57:41,100
Guys, I think I got baited.

3923
02:57:41,580 --> 02:57:43,680
I think I got baited.

3924
02:57:52,120 --> 02:57:53,060
Find a book.

3925
02:57:53,180 --> 02:57:53,940
Oh, is it book time?

3926
02:57:54,380 --> 02:57:55,100
Is this it?

3927
02:57:58,240 --> 02:57:59,500
Is this not the library?

3928
02:57:59,660 --> 02:58:00,260
But there's books!

3929
02:58:02,180 --> 02:58:03,740
There's more than one library?

3930
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:10,960
Guys, there's more than one library?

3931
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:13,780
Why the fuck did we fund all these libraries for?

3932
02:58:15,760 --> 02:58:16,960
Oh, there it is.

3933
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:18,080
Okay, fingerprints.

3934
02:58:20,020 --> 02:58:20,520
Fingerprints.

3935
02:58:20,660 --> 02:58:22,180
Okay, I found the fingerprints.

3936
02:58:23,240 --> 02:58:23,740
Okay.

3937
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:30,540
And then the trail disappears?

3938
02:58:33,280 --> 02:58:34,120
Okay.

3939
02:58:36,880 --> 02:58:37,720
Alright.

3940
02:58:40,440 --> 02:58:42,440
Where the fuck are the prints?

3941
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:46,460
I followed it!

3942
02:58:46,860 --> 02:58:49,200
I followed all the fingerprints!

3943
02:58:49,560 --> 02:58:51,100
That- the two fingerprints!

3944
02:58:56,140 --> 02:58:59,500
I mean, Harleen Quinzel was a psychiatrist.

3945
02:58:59,500 --> 02:59:01,440
And look where she ended up.

3946
02:59:01,860 --> 02:59:03,280
Uh, the- uh, the junkie.

3947
02:59:03,300 --> 02:59:03,940
Thank you for the superchat.

3948
02:59:04,020 --> 02:59:04,560
Thank you, thank you.

3949
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:08,980
Yes, but then that- they gotta hire people outside of Gotham City!

3950
02:59:09,660 --> 02:59:12,720
Why are we still hiring doctors in Gotham City?

3951
02:59:13,960 --> 02:59:15,780
They're clearly not reliable!

3952
02:59:17,360 --> 02:59:18,480
They're clearly not reliable!

3953
02:59:22,290 --> 02:59:23,890
Okay, it's the bottom floor.

3954
02:59:27,810 --> 02:59:28,890
Oh, there it is.

3955
02:59:30,010 --> 02:59:32,430
I didn't realize it was like super close.

3956
02:59:32,610 --> 02:59:33,170
I didn't realize it was like super close.

3957
02:59:35,890 --> 02:59:38,550
Oracle, I found Dr. Young's formula.

3958
02:59:38,850 --> 02:59:38,990
Great.

3959
02:59:39,350 --> 02:59:41,050
So does that mean you've stopped Joker?

3960
02:59:41,290 --> 02:59:42,510
You never stopped Joker.

3961
02:59:42,510 --> 02:59:43,030
What do you mean?

3962
02:59:43,270 --> 02:59:44,070
It's never this simple with him.

3963
02:59:44,250 --> 02:59:45,150
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3964
02:59:46,570 --> 02:59:47,870
What's that you've got there?

3965
02:59:47,990 --> 02:59:48,070
He

3966
03:00:07,100 --> 03:00:09,560
was acting out some twisted fantasy.

3967
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:12,360
Maybe he could get her talking?

3968
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:15,580
I think he probably can!

3969
03:00:16,160 --> 03:00:16,680
Great!

3970
03:00:19,590 --> 03:00:20,110
What?

3971
03:00:20,110 --> 03:00:23,810
Rescue Dr. Young from Zass in the warden's office?

3972
03:00:24,710 --> 03:00:25,230
What?

3973
03:00:25,250 --> 03:00:25,750
Wait, is that gas?

3974
03:00:29,510 --> 03:00:30,590
Not good.

3975
03:00:31,190 --> 03:00:32,330
Okay, we gotta go back.

3976
03:00:32,830 --> 03:00:34,130
Oh, that's not good.

3977
03:00:34,710 --> 03:00:36,630
Well, let me leave those two back there.

3978
03:00:41,790 --> 03:00:43,350
Sucks to be those...

3979
03:00:43,350 --> 03:00:46,130
Oh no, I missed the scarecrow gas.

3980
03:00:49,710 --> 03:00:51,310
It's the scarecrow gas.

3981
03:00:51,610 --> 03:00:52,630
God damn it.

3982
03:00:52,630 --> 03:00:55,730
I still left those two people there, so...

3983
03:00:55,730 --> 03:00:57,450
Sucks to be those two.

3984
03:01:04,430 --> 03:01:06,410
Oh no, it's the crime alley.

3985
03:01:14,430 --> 03:01:17,930
Alright, time to relive trauma.

3986
03:01:18,550 --> 03:01:19,690
This is where you're...

3987
03:01:19,690 --> 03:01:20,050
Oh shit!

3988
03:01:20,210 --> 03:01:22,930
Wait, it's actually called crime alley?

3989
03:01:23,430 --> 03:01:25,090
I thought that was a joke!

3990
03:01:25,150 --> 03:01:26,070
It's like a joke in Teen Titans!

3991
03:01:26,710 --> 03:01:28,150
And like...

3992
03:01:32,870 --> 03:01:33,510
Wait!

3993
03:01:34,810 --> 03:01:35,450
Okay...

3994
03:01:35,870 --> 03:01:38,550
The wave valley is actually stupid as fuck.

3995
03:01:38,810 --> 03:01:44,410
If you are like, multi-billionaires, you would not go down crime alley.

3996
03:01:45,050 --> 03:01:45,690
Like...

3997
03:01:45,690 --> 03:01:47,250
That's just like...

3998
03:01:47,250 --> 03:01:49,030
That's actually just fucking stupid.

3999
03:01:49,490 --> 03:01:50,870
Like, I thought that was a joke.

4000
03:01:50,950 --> 03:01:52,930
I didn't realize it was actually called crime alley.

4001
03:01:55,150 --> 03:01:55,270
I'm tired.

4002
03:01:55,450 --> 03:01:56,910
Can't we just wait for him here?

4003
03:01:57,050 --> 03:01:57,950
Come on, keep up.

4004
03:01:57,990 --> 03:01:58,630
We're nearly there.

4005
03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:03,720
Alright, here we go.

4006
03:02:03,880 --> 03:02:05,460
Down in crime alley!

4007
03:02:06,620 --> 03:02:07,700
Here we go!

4008
03:02:08,980 --> 03:02:10,560
Self-fulfilling prophecy!

4009
03:02:11,900 --> 03:02:12,860
Stay where you are.

4010
03:02:13,060 --> 03:02:13,820
I'll shoot.

4011
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:15,000
I'll give you whatever you want.

4012
03:02:15,060 --> 03:02:15,580
Oh!

4013
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:18,360
Did

4014
03:02:30,480 --> 03:02:32,160
we die in crime alley?

4015
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:35,580
It's true, that's crime-yally.

4016
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:36,760
Hahaha!

4017
03:02:37,220 --> 03:02:37,740
Hahaha!

4018
03:02:40,450 --> 03:02:41,130
Um...

4019
03:02:41,130 --> 03:02:42,770
Doki, it's Latin.

4020
03:02:46,990 --> 03:02:47,670
Why?

4021
03:02:48,290 --> 03:02:50,350
Crime alley was supposed to be safe!

4022
03:02:51,090 --> 03:02:52,350
Oh, there's my bat.

4023
03:02:52,890 --> 03:02:54,270
My bat signal.

4024
03:02:56,050 --> 03:02:57,210
Oh, I can move?

4025
03:02:58,390 --> 03:02:59,070
No.

4026
03:03:03,190 --> 03:03:03,870
Jesus.

4027
03:03:11,630 --> 03:03:12,510
You better just get the bat.

4028
03:03:12,510 --> 03:03:14,150
I mean, money can not fix trauma.

4029
03:03:14,510 --> 03:03:15,410
Whatever you say, Gordon.

4030
03:03:15,590 --> 03:03:17,730
His butler is on his way to pick him up.

4031
03:03:17,830 --> 03:03:18,550
You hear that?

4032
03:03:18,670 --> 03:03:19,290
He's got a hot puff.

4033
03:03:19,310 --> 03:03:20,470
Bro, that's fucked up.

4034
03:03:20,530 --> 03:03:21,510
Wait, what is...

4035
03:03:21,510 --> 03:03:22,810
I mean, there's no blood!

4036
03:03:23,250 --> 03:03:24,710
I just need to ask you some questions.

4037
03:03:25,310 --> 03:03:26,510
Can I get you anything?

4038
03:03:27,030 --> 03:03:28,650
I'm a tiny little boy.

4039
03:03:29,910 --> 03:03:35,460
You don't feel like answering me, but it's the only way to catch you did this.

4040
03:03:43,790 --> 03:03:44,870
I don't know.

4041
03:03:45,510 --> 03:03:45,950
It's a cut.

4042
03:03:53,910 --> 03:03:54,390
Whoa!

4043
03:03:55,750 --> 03:03:57,790
I look back and I'm like, oh, my parents are okay.

4044
03:03:58,330 --> 03:03:58,810
Alright.

4045
03:04:00,110 --> 03:04:02,810
Alright, so that was James Gordon.

4046
03:04:03,790 --> 03:04:06,350
Oh no, back to the scarecrow we go.

4047
03:04:07,150 --> 03:04:08,190
Alright, here we go.

4048
03:04:09,190 --> 03:04:10,310
Here we go again.

4049
03:04:13,730 --> 03:04:14,670
There is he.

4050
03:04:17,070 --> 03:04:17,610
Whoa!

4051
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:27,800
He's back!

4052
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:29,580
I thought I beat the shitter out of you.

4053
03:04:31,560 --> 03:04:32,100
Okay.

4054
03:04:32,800 --> 03:04:35,000
Okay, I can hide here.

4055
03:04:35,780 --> 03:04:36,320
Nice.

4056
03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:38,100
I can keep running.

4057
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:39,900
I can- NOOOO!

4058
03:04:41,600 --> 03:04:42,140
Fuck!

4059
03:04:43,220 --> 03:04:43,760
Okay.

4060
03:04:47,900 --> 03:04:49,820
Alright, use the black- OHHHH!

4061
03:04:50,340 --> 03:04:52,240
The back cloud to create new cover!

4062
03:04:52,320 --> 03:04:53,560
Okay, I didn't realize you could do that.

4063
03:04:53,660 --> 03:04:54,040
Fuck!

4064
03:04:54,720 --> 03:04:57,580
Sorry, I got a little impatient.

4065
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,540
I got a little impatient.

4066
03:05:00,740 --> 03:05:02,360
I thought I could run fast!

4067
03:05:03,480 --> 03:05:03,960
Okay.

4068
03:05:07,980 --> 03:05:08,900
Okay, here we go.

4069
03:05:10,320 --> 03:05:10,800
Okay.

4070
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:13,740
Alright, now I know.

4071
03:05:15,020 --> 03:05:15,500
Whoa!

4072
03:05:16,640 --> 03:05:17,300
Here we go.

4073
03:05:18,600 --> 03:05:20,560
What did I- Okay, okay, I was gonna say.

4074
03:05:20,780 --> 03:05:22,360
I was worried that like...

4075
03:05:23,120 --> 03:05:23,580
Uhh...

4076
03:05:25,440 --> 03:05:29,000
I was worried that like me pulling it down would also trigger him.

4077
03:05:30,600 --> 03:05:32,660
I like all these different mechanics though.

4078
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:35,720
Cause it's not- It doesn't- It's not just one thing.

4079
03:05:36,400 --> 03:05:38,100
Alright, run, run, run, run, run.

4080
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,760
They were murdered by Joe Chill?!

4081
03:05:42,620 --> 03:05:43,660
That's just sad.

4082
03:05:45,240 --> 03:05:45,700
Oh!

4083
03:05:51,300 --> 03:05:51,940
Nothing?

4084
03:05:53,220 --> 03:05:54,380
It was nothing?

4085
03:05:54,860 --> 03:05:55,600
Oh shit.

4086
03:05:55,880 --> 03:05:57,560
Alright, I can beat up the skeletons.

4087
03:05:57,980 --> 03:05:58,620
Sorry!

4088
03:05:59,280 --> 03:06:04,960
Okay, it's a little funny to see a skeleton try to sucker punch me.

4089
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:09,200
It's a little quirky there.

4090
03:06:10,200 --> 03:06:12,080
Yeah, you got a little bit of no chill.

4091
03:06:12,240 --> 03:06:14,020
Also, they're billionaires.

4092
03:06:14,040 --> 03:06:17,840
Why are they watching a movie with the public?

4093
03:06:23,860 --> 03:06:26,700
I bet you they have their own home theater.

4094
03:06:30,280 --> 03:06:32,360
Wouldn't they have their own home theater?

4095
03:06:36,650 --> 03:06:37,170
Okay.

4096
03:06:39,410 --> 03:06:42,170
I wanna know how this is gonna go back and forth.

4097
03:06:47,010 --> 03:06:50,450
Okay, what if they just wanna live a normal life?

4098
03:06:51,190 --> 03:06:52,850
Alright, you don't understand.

4099
03:06:53,330 --> 03:06:58,070
They wanted to know what it was like out there.

4100
03:06:58,210 --> 03:06:59,870
Like the common folk.

4101
03:07:03,090 --> 03:07:04,250
Alright, let's see.

4102
03:07:06,210 --> 03:07:07,370
It wasn't a theater.

4103
03:07:07,590 --> 03:07:08,630
It was like a movie.

4104
03:07:10,430 --> 03:07:12,550
Unless they retconned that again.

4105
03:07:15,490 --> 03:07:16,730
Oh god.

4106
03:07:17,290 --> 03:07:18,150
Oh god.

4107
03:07:18,630 --> 03:07:19,470
Oh god.

4108
03:07:19,610 --> 03:07:19,990
No!

4109
03:07:20,310 --> 03:07:22,630
I jumped the wrong way!

4110
03:07:23,350 --> 03:07:24,790
It was the opera?

4111
03:07:24,910 --> 03:07:26,670
I thought it was movie theater.

4112
03:07:31,810 --> 03:07:34,350
Unless it got retconned.

4113
03:07:34,470 --> 03:07:36,530
I went the wrong way.

4114
03:07:40,470 --> 03:07:41,970
I swear to god.

4115
03:07:42,150 --> 03:07:44,410
At one point, it was a movie.

4116
03:07:47,490 --> 03:07:49,030
Yeah, it was the movie.

4117
03:07:49,130 --> 03:07:53,090
Okay, they retconned it so many times that it stopped making sense.

4118
03:07:54,510 --> 03:07:57,590
This is why the comic industry is dying.

4119
03:07:58,250 --> 03:08:01,410
Because they keep... they retcon... like... oh my god, please.

4120
03:08:03,090 --> 03:08:11,390
They retconned so many times that like... that like it's just hard to like keep up with anything.

4121
03:08:13,710 --> 03:08:16,670
And they rebooted so many fucking times.

4122
03:08:16,810 --> 03:08:19,610
Like it's just... it's just a headache.

4123
03:08:21,230 --> 03:08:23,950
Because you guys were like, no, it's the opera.

4124
03:08:24,110 --> 03:08:25,490
And I was like, it was the opera?

4125
03:08:27,250 --> 03:08:28,370
I thought it was the movies.

4126
03:08:34,310 --> 03:08:37,050
Okay, well, I guess I'm not gonna get off the pillar.

4127
03:08:37,230 --> 03:08:38,170
I can't get off of it.

4128
03:08:39,750 --> 03:08:40,190
Alright,

4129
03:08:46,660 --> 03:08:47,760
move on the other side.

4130
03:08:47,980 --> 03:08:48,240
Okay.

4131
03:08:50,400 --> 03:08:50,840
Nice.

4132
03:08:50,940 --> 03:08:51,260
Okay.

4133
03:08:51,480 --> 03:08:52,300
They got us.

4134
03:08:52,800 --> 03:08:54,340
Please let me go.

4135
03:08:55,660 --> 03:08:57,280
Alright, give me the skellies!

4136
03:08:58,460 --> 03:09:00,140
Give me the skellies!

4137
03:09:01,320 --> 03:09:02,220
Get over here.

4138
03:09:02,520 --> 03:09:03,820
Get the fuck over here.

4139
03:09:03,880 --> 03:09:05,880
I just love how they have the...

4140
03:09:06,540 --> 03:09:07,580
They even have the...

4141
03:09:07,580 --> 03:09:08,260
They have crowbars.

4142
03:09:10,280 --> 03:09:12,300
You think that's gonna kill me?

4143
03:09:12,780 --> 03:09:14,900
You have no muscle on those bones!

4144
03:09:17,100 --> 03:09:17,940
Alright, nice.

4145
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:20,660
I got a bone to pick with you.

4146
03:09:20,720 --> 03:09:22,200
Hello, Mr. Bones.

4147
03:09:22,580 --> 03:09:23,820
Thank you for the super chat.

4148
03:09:23,940 --> 03:09:24,820
Thank you, thank you.

4149
03:09:25,320 --> 03:09:26,040
Alright, climb.

4150
03:09:28,900 --> 03:09:29,740
Oh, RB.

4151
03:09:32,080 --> 03:09:32,600
Okay.

4152
03:09:33,540 --> 03:09:35,480
Oh, there's no...

4153
03:09:36,400 --> 03:09:39,320
I don't think there's... Okay, yeah, there's here.

4154
03:09:42,240 --> 03:09:43,400
Can you stop looking?

4155
03:09:44,420 --> 03:09:45,560
Where is he looking at?

4156
03:09:47,820 --> 03:09:48,660
I can't tell.

4157
03:09:48,900 --> 03:09:50,000
Where is he looking at?

4158
03:09:50,540 --> 03:09:52,120
No, thank you for the aca soup!

4159
03:09:52,240 --> 03:09:53,400
Thank you, thank... What?

4160
03:09:53,640 --> 03:09:54,040
No!

4161
03:09:55,620 --> 03:09:58,540
Oh my god, but it's an aca, aca, aca, aca soup!

4162
03:09:58,600 --> 03:09:59,360
It was worth it.

4163
03:09:59,540 --> 03:10:00,760
It was worth it.

4164
03:10:01,160 --> 03:10:02,920
It was worth it.

4165
03:10:03,120 --> 03:10:05,460
Thank you for the aca, aca, aca, aca soup.

4166
03:10:06,980 --> 03:10:08,660
It was worth it.

4167
03:10:09,060 --> 03:10:10,600
It was worth it.

4168
03:10:10,880 --> 03:10:11,400
It was worth it.

4169
03:10:11,400 --> 03:10:11,400
It was worth it.

4170
03:10:13,160 --> 03:10:14,000
I made it.

4171
03:10:14,140 --> 03:10:14,960
I made it.

4172
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:15,540
There you go.

4173
03:10:16,680 --> 03:10:18,100
It was totally worth it.

4174
03:10:21,100 --> 03:10:22,140
I can get there.

4175
03:10:22,280 --> 03:10:24,600
I can get there before he looks at me!

4176
03:10:24,860 --> 03:10:25,320
Nice.

4177
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:29,560
The scarecrow hired them.

4178
03:10:45,460 --> 03:10:46,180
I'm here.

4179
03:10:51,270 --> 03:10:52,810
The scarecrow hired them.

4180
03:10:53,090 --> 03:10:53,610
Anyone?

4181
03:10:54,570 --> 03:10:55,050
No?

4182
03:10:56,070 --> 03:10:56,590
No.

4183
03:10:56,590 --> 03:10:57,270
That's good.

4184
03:10:59,330 --> 03:11:01,790
Zazz has Dr Young trapped in the warden's office.

4185
03:11:02,010 --> 03:11:03,090
I've got to get out of here.

4186
03:11:03,250 --> 03:11:04,230
How do I get out of here?

4187
03:11:06,670 --> 03:11:07,830
Am I stuck here?

4188
03:11:08,810 --> 03:11:09,750
Do I...

4189
03:11:10,270 --> 03:11:10,590
Wait.

4190
03:11:12,290 --> 03:11:12,810
Okay.

4191
03:11:13,350 --> 03:11:17,090
I didn't think I could break that rope because it's a pretty thick rope.

4192
03:11:17,090 --> 03:11:17,310
Broke.

4193
03:11:21,330 --> 03:11:21,770
Yay!

4194
03:11:23,310 --> 03:11:24,870
Who needs to tell time?

4195
03:11:25,390 --> 03:11:27,050
I'll just fix it with money later.

4196
03:11:27,830 --> 03:11:28,270
Yay!

4197
03:11:28,970 --> 03:11:30,870
Property damage does not matter for me.

4198
03:11:34,600 --> 03:11:35,040
Alright.

4199
03:11:35,340 --> 03:11:37,080
Oh hey, the bridge is fixed.

4200
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:39,320
Or like, not the bridge, the gates.

4201
03:11:39,560 --> 03:11:40,940
Oh my god, wait, yeah!

4202
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:42,860
Property damage does not fucking matter!

4203
03:11:43,060 --> 03:11:45,240
Because like, I'm so fucking rich, I...

4204
03:11:45,240 --> 03:11:48,140
If I break property, I can just fix it with money!

4205
03:11:50,440 --> 03:11:52,820
A game of cat and mouse can be painful.

4206
03:11:53,780 --> 03:11:54,340
Okay.

4207
03:11:59,480 --> 03:11:59,960
Let's see.

4208
03:12:04,830 --> 03:12:06,010
That's my superpower.

4209
03:12:06,470 --> 03:12:07,890
I'm just gonna fucking beat him up.

4210
03:12:09,370 --> 03:12:10,470
Oh shit!

4211
03:12:11,010 --> 03:12:11,810
You know what?

4212
03:12:12,050 --> 03:12:13,210
I can take him.

4213
03:12:17,380 --> 03:12:17,940
Alright.

4214
03:12:20,540 --> 03:12:21,720
That's fucking right.

4215
03:12:21,880 --> 03:12:22,320
Boom!

4216
03:12:22,660 --> 03:12:24,100
That's- Oh shit!

4217
03:12:24,200 --> 03:12:24,540
Okay.

4218
03:12:26,080 --> 03:12:26,640
What?

4219
03:12:26,700 --> 03:12:27,120
Okay.

4220
03:12:28,800 --> 03:12:29,320
Alright.

4221
03:12:29,580 --> 03:12:29,840
Alright.

4222
03:12:30,920 --> 03:12:31,160
Come on.

4223
03:12:33,880 --> 03:12:34,660
There we go.

4224
03:12:34,960 --> 03:12:36,560
Wait, how do I kill him then?

4225
03:12:37,380 --> 03:12:38,580
How do I kill him?

4226
03:12:38,620 --> 03:12:39,780
Do I just...

4227
03:12:42,720 --> 03:12:43,240
Oh!

4228
03:12:44,120 --> 03:12:44,640
Okay.

4229
03:12:46,320 --> 03:12:47,740
That was easy.

4230
03:12:48,780 --> 03:12:49,300
Nice.

4231
03:12:50,840 --> 03:12:52,200
Sorry, how do I...

4232
03:12:52,940 --> 03:12:54,680
Make sure he just doesn't...

4233
03:12:54,680 --> 03:12:55,580
Get up.

4234
03:12:56,200 --> 03:12:57,560
But like, still be alive.

4235
03:13:03,680 --> 03:13:10,100
All of us.

4236
03:13:12,800 --> 03:13:14,680
My great father...

4237
03:13:14,680 --> 03:13:15,760
I'm going to be like...

4238
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:19,500
Well, that's my way of saying...

4239
03:13:19,500 --> 03:13:20,300
Bye!

4240
03:13:20,540 --> 03:13:20,600
Well, let's go.

4241
03:13:20,600 --> 03:13:20,740
I got some of that.

4242
03:13:20,740 --> 03:13:21,220
Uh...

4243
03:13:22,360 --> 03:13:23,040
I don't want to be like...

4244
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:24,720
I'll tell you what, I think that this is awesome.

4245
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:25,160
I don't want to be like...

4246
03:13:25,160 --> 03:13:25,600
I don't know why but...

4247
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:25,960
No!

4248
03:13:28,620 --> 03:13:29,300
What.

4249
03:13:29,420 --> 03:13:29,440
I'm gonna die!

4250
03:13:29,500 --> 03:13:30,020
I won't die!

4251
03:13:30,160 --> 03:13:30,380
I'll kill you!

4252
03:13:30,380 --> 03:13:30,560
I don't know what.

4253
03:13:31,020 --> 03:13:31,540
I don't know.

4254
03:13:31,560 --> 03:13:32,160
Oh no!

4255
03:13:33,920 --> 03:13:35,860
Maybe... is there... let me... this?

4256
03:13:37,440 --> 03:13:41,380
Wait a minute.

4257
03:13:41,780 --> 03:13:43,440
Oh no, that's just the bathroom.

4258
03:13:43,860 --> 03:13:46,940
Sir, I would like to use the bathroom real quick.

4259
03:13:47,440 --> 03:13:49,880
Not the ears!

4260
03:13:50,200 --> 03:13:51,940
But what about all the wheelchairs?

4261
03:13:51,940 --> 03:13:52,380
The ears!?

4262
03:13:57,920 --> 03:13:58,480
Joker!

4263
03:13:58,940 --> 03:14:01,480
That is a waste of a perfectly good wheelchair!

4264
03:14:03,920 --> 03:14:04,480
Servers!

4265
03:14:04,580 --> 03:14:06,080
Welcome to the tomato farm!

4266
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:06,740
Welcome Welcome!

4267
03:14:07,320 --> 03:14:08,600
Is that everything?

4268
03:14:10,080 --> 03:14:12,500
I thought there would be an actual...

4269
03:14:17,840 --> 03:14:21,380
I felt like there would be an actual trophy here.

4270
03:14:21,920 --> 03:14:23,900
Servers, thank you for 10 gifted shards!

4271
03:14:23,960 --> 03:14:24,920
Thank you- Thank you!

4272
03:14:27,860 --> 03:14:28,560
The fuck?

4273
03:14:28,660 --> 03:14:29,860
What's the point of going in here?

4274
03:14:30,220 --> 03:14:31,280
There's no trophy?

4275
03:14:31,980 --> 03:14:33,120
I feel scammed.

4276
03:14:34,500 --> 03:14:36,240
I can't believe there was no trophy.

4277
03:14:39,140 --> 03:14:39,620
Hello?

4278
03:14:43,600 --> 03:14:45,340
Who the fuck is this guy?

4279
03:14:45,420 --> 03:14:45,940
Is that Zazz?

4280
03:14:47,480 --> 03:14:48,980
Don't worry, I'm coming over!

4281
03:14:50,820 --> 03:14:51,520
Oh shit.

4282
03:14:54,260 --> 03:14:57,860
If you had arranged a murder, I would show the more of a doctor.

4283
03:14:59,880 --> 03:15:00,680
I'm sorry!

4284
03:15:00,960 --> 03:15:03,200
The trophy was right there!

4285
03:15:04,040 --> 03:15:04,060
Who are you?

4286
03:15:04,600 --> 03:15:08,280
Playing you like a violin and cutting your strings?

4287
03:15:08,400 --> 03:15:10,600
But the trophy...

4288
03:15:11,400 --> 03:15:13,140
No, you don't understand!

4289
03:15:13,560 --> 03:15:15,720
The trophy was right there!

4290
03:15:16,520 --> 03:15:17,580
Listen to me carefully.

4291
03:15:18,380 --> 03:15:19,500
Help me!

4292
03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:21,140
What is happening out there?

4293
03:15:21,140 --> 03:15:22,260
I'm coming over.

4294
03:15:22,680 --> 03:15:23,860
Come any closer.

4295
03:15:24,260 --> 03:15:25,040
Help me!

4296
03:15:26,380 --> 03:15:26,740
No!

4297
03:15:26,800 --> 03:15:27,720
Who the fuck is this?

4298
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:30,340
Who do you think is arranging a murder?

4299
03:15:30,400 --> 03:15:31,440
What is going on?

4300
03:15:32,100 --> 03:15:34,000
I crouched on everything!

4301
03:15:36,500 --> 03:15:38,940
I'm too lazy.

4302
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:41,840
Playing you like a violin and cutting your strings?

4303
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:42,820
I don't understand!

4304
03:15:43,360 --> 03:15:45,200
I even crouched!

4305
03:15:45,840 --> 03:15:47,800
Listen to me carefully.

4306
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:49,420
Help me!

4307
03:15:49,420 --> 03:15:50,580
What is happening out there?

4308
03:15:50,580 --> 03:15:52,140
I guess I'll help.

4309
03:15:52,580 --> 03:15:53,760
Come any closer.

4310
03:16:06,400 --> 03:16:07,760
I'm sorry!

4311
03:16:08,100 --> 03:16:10,000
The trophy was so dis... No!

4312
03:16:10,240 --> 03:16:11,220
Give me my trophy!

4313
03:16:24,260 --> 03:16:24,680
I know.

4314
03:16:25,500 --> 03:16:26,860
Joker threatened me.

4315
03:16:26,960 --> 03:16:29,080
I wanted to stop the experiment.

4316
03:16:29,600 --> 03:16:31,660
I tried to give him his money back.

4317
03:16:31,940 --> 03:16:36,900
You don't just give back money from... Yeah, you don't just give back money from... He doesn't give a fuck about money!

4318
03:16:37,740 --> 03:16:39,800
You think he cares about money?

4319
03:16:40,340 --> 03:16:41,820
So now he has venom.

4320
03:16:41,960 --> 03:16:43,100
End your formula.

4321
03:16:43,460 --> 03:16:44,500
God, I hate his ears.

4322
03:16:44,540 --> 03:16:46,380
I want to like just cut his ears off.

4323
03:16:46,540 --> 03:16:48,280
There's a lamp hidden in the gardens.

4324
03:16:48,520 --> 03:16:53,180
It's locked off, but the security key codes for the entire island are in the warden's safe.

4325
03:16:53,320 --> 03:16:54,120
What else?

4326
03:16:54,260 --> 03:16:56,200
It's just in the warden's safe?

4327
03:16:56,380 --> 03:16:56,800
Everything?

4328
03:16:59,280 --> 03:17:01,480
Oh my god!

4329
03:17:02,400 --> 03:17:03,580
Oh shit!

4330
03:17:03,860 --> 03:17:05,760
Yeah, I thought it was just obviously a bomb.

4331
03:17:09,150 --> 03:17:12,250
I feel like he'd see the Joker's face first.

4332
03:17:13,370 --> 03:17:15,870
Like the spray paint.

4333
03:17:21,270 --> 03:17:21,990
Oh!

4334
03:17:23,050 --> 03:17:23,630
Oh!

4335
03:17:40,940 --> 03:17:42,340
He needs to watch.

4336
03:17:43,440 --> 03:17:44,700
Oh shit, there he is.

4337
03:17:44,780 --> 03:17:45,620
Wait, what about the doctor?

4338
03:17:48,520 --> 03:17:49,580
Is he okay?

4339
03:17:51,340 --> 03:17:52,140
All right, nice.

4340
03:17:55,720 --> 03:18:00,620
All right, as long as the fucking guy with the shocker doesn't get near me, it's fine.

4341
03:18:03,320 --> 03:18:05,600
Let me get this guy out real quick.

4342
03:18:05,760 --> 03:18:06,960
Okay, get out of here.

4343
03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:07,740
Oh shit, no.

4344
03:18:07,760 --> 03:18:08,340
Get out of here.

4345
03:18:08,620 --> 03:18:09,940
Let me kill this guy first.

4346
03:18:11,700 --> 03:18:13,220
God damn it, get out!

4347
03:18:13,680 --> 03:18:14,400
Leave me alone!

4348
03:18:16,220 --> 03:18:17,360
Okay, there we go.

4349
03:18:18,160 --> 03:18:20,540
Let me just run around him.

4350
03:18:20,980 --> 03:18:22,620
Reggie, thank you for the five Kimفسious!

4351
03:18:22,720 --> 03:18:22,940
Thank you!

4352
03:18:23,100 --> 03:18:23,540
Thank you!

4353
03:18:24,780 --> 03:18:26,400
Mecca he's not going anywhere!

4354
03:18:26,620 --> 03:18:28,380
He's already got out twice tonight.

4355
03:18:28,500 --> 03:18:29,660
Thank you for the super shot.

4356
03:18:29,760 --> 03:18:30,060
Thank you.

4357
03:18:30,120 --> 03:18:30,420
Thank you.

4358
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:35,220
Oh shit, she's dead?!

4359
03:18:38,540 --> 03:18:39,880
Oh shit, she's dead?!

4360
03:18:39,880 --> 03:18:39,920
Oh shit, she's dead?!

4361
03:18:59,510 --> 03:19:00,930
Oh, she's dead!

4362
03:19:03,950 --> 03:19:06,490
I was like, where is she?

4363
03:19:07,270 --> 03:19:10,310
Oh, you mean the body part that's surrounded by blood?

4364
03:19:10,310 --> 03:19:10,530
Blood?

4365
03:19:14,270 --> 03:19:15,910
Where could she be?

4366
03:19:19,410 --> 03:19:21,390
Sorry, I didn't notice that was actually her.

4367
03:19:28,060 --> 03:19:28,540
Nice.

4368
03:19:31,460 --> 03:19:32,540
Oh shit, what's this?

4369
03:19:33,180 --> 03:19:34,320
Oh, there's a secrets map.

4370
03:19:34,480 --> 03:19:34,720
Nice.

4371
03:19:41,380 --> 03:19:42,940
Apparently there's a secret room?

4372
03:19:44,900 --> 03:19:46,860
She was not bombproof?

4373
03:19:46,940 --> 03:19:48,220
There's no fucking way.

4374
03:19:50,440 --> 03:19:52,460
Oh hey, there is a related trophy here.

4375
03:19:57,580 --> 03:19:59,780
Scan surface in room.

4376
03:20:00,280 --> 03:20:01,160
Which surface?

4377
03:20:04,440 --> 03:20:05,360
Which surface?

4378
03:20:05,560 --> 03:20:09,140
Oh hey, there's the ventriloquist.

4379
03:20:11,140 --> 03:20:13,460
Isn't the warden too old for a puppet show?

4380
03:20:14,340 --> 03:20:15,400
Wait, that's Scar.

4381
03:20:15,480 --> 03:20:15,640
Yeah.

4382
03:20:15,640 --> 03:20:18,500
The Scarface and the Ventriloquist.

4383
03:20:18,940 --> 03:20:28,320
Gothen's Blackgate Penitentiary once had a gallows tree from which 313 criminals with death sentences were hanged.

4384
03:20:28,360 --> 03:20:32,120
The wood from the tree was widowed by an inmate into the puppet Scarface.

4385
03:20:32,400 --> 03:20:39,560
And that inmate was worth his height and was murdered by Arnold Wesker, a man who would soon fall under Scarface's influence.

4386
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:48,800
While most believe that Scarface is simply a tool through which Wesker, as the criminal mastermind, the Ventriloquist, acts out a dark side to his personality.

4387
03:20:49,080 --> 03:20:57,760
Wesker himself believes that Scarface is possessed by the souls who died beneath the gallows tree and the puppet actually motivates him to commit the duo's many crimes.

4388
03:20:58,080 --> 03:21:04,260
I hear like Scarface is now like under like a woman is now the new Ventriloquist.

4389
03:21:04,520 --> 03:21:07,320
Because the original Ventriloquist fucking died.

4390
03:21:10,260 --> 03:21:12,000
So where is the secret?

4391
03:21:12,380 --> 03:21:13,520
You guys said there's a secret!

4392
03:21:17,100 --> 03:21:18,080
Where's the secret?

4393
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:21,500
It's in the walls.

4394
03:21:25,640 --> 03:21:27,780
It's in the walls, Dokie!

4395
03:21:27,880 --> 03:21:29,160
It's in the walls!

4396
03:21:30,840 --> 03:21:31,780
That wall!

4397
03:21:31,900 --> 03:21:33,240
Thank you guys.

4398
03:21:33,660 --> 03:21:38,140
I really appreciate the guidance of the walls.

4399
03:21:38,540 --> 03:21:39,240
This wall?

4400
03:21:40,940 --> 03:21:42,300
I'm up against the wall.

4401
03:21:42,500 --> 03:21:43,880
Punch every wall.

4402
03:21:44,600 --> 03:21:47,080
Okay, now I actually don't know if I should...

4403
03:21:47,080 --> 03:21:47,960
I can't tell if you're fucking with me.

4404
03:21:48,140 --> 03:21:52,480
I cannot tell if you're fucking with me.

4405
03:21:53,840 --> 03:21:54,860
Left entrance.

4406
03:21:55,320 --> 03:21:58,680
Oh, secret has to use a gel.

4407
03:21:59,880 --> 03:22:00,560
A gel?

4408
03:22:00,840 --> 03:22:01,660
Okay, so...

4409
03:22:01,660 --> 03:22:03,500
But then I don't see it though.

4410
03:22:04,320 --> 03:22:05,000
Okay.

4411
03:22:06,680 --> 03:22:07,600
That wall.

4412
03:22:09,760 --> 03:22:11,700
If I keep... If I gel everything.

4413
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:15,380
If I gel everything eventually.

4414
03:22:17,640 --> 03:22:18,740
Three gels.

4415
03:22:19,560 --> 03:22:20,700
There we go.

4416
03:22:22,980 --> 03:22:24,620
It was not that wall.

4417
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:28,100
It was not that wall.

4418
03:22:28,340 --> 03:22:29,860
Right next... This one?

4419
03:22:32,580 --> 03:22:34,220
All will be gel.

4420
03:22:36,120 --> 03:22:37,740
All will be gel.

4421
03:22:40,180 --> 03:22:42,040
All will be gel.

4422
03:22:44,320 --> 03:22:45,620
Eventually... Oh, and the floor.

4423
03:22:45,780 --> 03:22:46,360
I guess.

4424
03:22:47,080 --> 03:22:48,180
And the floor.

4425
03:22:53,010 --> 03:22:55,070
Oh, three in the same place?

4426
03:22:55,630 --> 03:22:56,270
What?

4427
03:22:58,710 --> 03:22:59,610
Look up.

4428
03:22:59,650 --> 03:23:01,110
Why the fuck would I look up?

4429
03:23:01,750 --> 03:23:02,390
Okay.

4430
03:23:04,510 --> 03:23:06,390
It's technically the same place.

4431
03:23:09,810 --> 03:23:10,450
Wow!

4432
03:23:10,450 --> 03:23:11,490
I did it.

4433
03:23:12,890 --> 03:23:14,490
A floor... What is this?

4434
03:23:18,750 --> 03:23:19,390
What?

4435
03:23:19,390 --> 03:23:20,190
What's that?

4436
03:23:24,770 --> 03:23:26,190
Oh, is this Scarface?

4437
03:23:27,790 --> 03:23:28,410
Like...

4438
03:23:30,310 --> 03:23:31,450
Secret tunnel.

4439
03:23:33,450 --> 03:23:34,790
Look at the blueprint.

4440
03:23:36,270 --> 03:23:37,010
This one?

4441
03:23:42,180 --> 03:23:43,140
This blueprint?

4442
03:23:46,120 --> 03:23:48,100
Blueprint to a... Is this Arkham City?

4443
03:23:48,240 --> 03:23:49,740
Oh, is this like... Oh!

4444
03:23:51,280 --> 03:23:53,820
Oh, is this like a... Oh, zoom in?

4445
03:23:54,960 --> 03:23:56,200
Yeah, I was gonna say.

4446
03:23:56,280 --> 03:23:57,820
Is this like a plan for...

4447
03:23:58,820 --> 03:23:59,260
Uh...

4448
03:24:03,360 --> 03:24:03,800
No?

4449
03:24:08,950 --> 03:24:09,890
Not letting me zoom.

4450
03:24:14,140 --> 03:24:16,060
This is a plan for the sequel, right?

4451
03:24:18,900 --> 03:24:19,780
Oh, that's cool.

4452
03:24:20,880 --> 03:24:22,360
It's like a sequel bait.

4453
03:24:24,900 --> 03:24:27,540
Well, I already know Arkham City was next.

4454
03:24:27,920 --> 03:24:28,360
Hahaha!

4455
03:24:28,360 --> 03:24:28,460
Hahaha!

4456
03:24:34,240 --> 03:24:41,000
It just makes me think that... Because like back then, I feel like 10 years ago or 14 years ago, people don't really like...

4457
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:43,200
Was it datamined stuff back then?

4458
03:24:43,420 --> 03:24:44,700
I mean, people did, I feel like.

4459
03:24:44,740 --> 03:24:45,380
I'm sure people did.

4460
03:24:45,640 --> 03:24:52,100
But like it wasn't as like intense as it was in the... as it is now, I feel like.

4461
03:24:53,780 --> 03:24:55,920
Wait, there must be like a cat and mouse here somewhere.

4462
03:24:55,920 --> 03:24:58,260
If it's like cat and mouse.

4463
03:24:58,560 --> 03:25:00,080
Yeah, it wasn't as common.

4464
03:25:00,400 --> 03:25:03,280
I feel like someone must have been like just fucking...

4465
03:25:03,910 --> 03:25:06,460
Just spraying every fucking wall.

4466
03:25:08,420 --> 03:25:09,460
That's pretty cool.

4467
03:25:09,960 --> 03:25:11,120
Alright, riddle me this.

4468
03:25:12,020 --> 03:25:13,100
Scan the display.

4469
03:25:13,280 --> 03:25:13,760
This one?

4470
03:25:15,580 --> 03:25:16,500
Which display?

4471
03:25:22,070 --> 03:25:23,710
Bathroom mirror, scan yourself.

4472
03:25:23,930 --> 03:25:24,650
There's a mirror?

4473
03:25:26,470 --> 03:25:27,950
There is no mirror here.

4474
03:25:31,510 --> 03:25:32,810
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

4475
03:25:32,870 --> 03:25:34,070
There is no mirror here.

4476
03:25:34,430 --> 03:25:36,570
I feel like it has to be a display case.

4477
03:25:36,850 --> 03:25:37,450
Is that it?

4478
03:25:38,030 --> 03:25:38,790
Oh, there it is.

4479
03:25:40,190 --> 03:25:40,710
Catwoman.

4480
03:25:46,250 --> 03:25:49,510
An orphan who learned to survive on Gotham City streets.

4481
03:25:49,930 --> 03:25:52,230
Selina Kyle took to thievery to survive.

4482
03:25:52,490 --> 03:25:54,130
But determined to do it in style.

4483
03:25:54,130 --> 03:26:01,690
She learned martial arts and trained extensively to perfect her skills at cat burglary.

4484
03:26:02,090 --> 03:26:06,710
Her criminal activities are often tampered with by reluctant altruism.

4485
03:26:06,890 --> 03:26:09,050
Making her an inconstant...

4486
03:26:09,050 --> 03:26:10,510
Oh, he's like an anti-hero.

4487
03:26:10,790 --> 03:26:12,050
Is that the right word?

4488
03:26:12,450 --> 03:26:15,590
An inconstant villain and occasional hero.

4489
03:26:15,770 --> 03:26:19,090
She regularly eludes captured by the Dark Knight.

4490
03:26:19,330 --> 03:26:23,310
And maintains a complicated aversive relationship with Batman.

4491
03:26:23,310 --> 03:26:27,290
That frequently turns flirtatious and occasionally legitimately romantic.

4492
03:26:28,990 --> 03:26:29,550
Nice.

4493
03:26:29,750 --> 03:26:30,330
Oh, teeth!

4494
03:26:32,210 --> 03:26:33,330
That's right, Batman.

4495
03:26:33,630 --> 03:26:34,210
You got some.

4496
03:26:38,360 --> 03:26:38,920
Alright.

4497
03:26:40,100 --> 03:26:41,500
Does that save my game?

4498
03:26:41,680 --> 03:26:42,380
I think it does.

4499
03:26:42,540 --> 03:26:42,920
Alright!

4500
03:26:44,180 --> 03:26:47,540
We are gonna call it here, guys.

4501
03:26:49,020 --> 03:26:49,580
Oh!

4502
03:26:49,940 --> 03:26:51,940
Oh my gosh, I'm really tired.

4503
03:26:52,220 --> 03:26:53,320
I'm gonna call it here.

4504
03:26:53,600 --> 03:26:54,600
I had a long...

4505
03:26:55,240 --> 03:26:55,800
day.

4506
03:26:56,940 --> 03:26:57,500
Oh!

4507
03:26:58,220 --> 03:26:59,760
That was really fun, though!

4508
03:26:59,940 --> 03:27:01,540
That was really, really fun.

4509
03:27:01,840 --> 03:27:04,460
I've been enjoying Batman Arkham Asylum.

4510
03:27:04,520 --> 03:27:09,120
I'm so happy to actually be able to play this game now.

4511
03:27:09,280 --> 03:27:14,040
Because it's like, it's honestly been like a game I've been wanting to play for the longest time.

4512
03:27:14,620 --> 03:27:15,180
And...

4513
03:27:16,060 --> 03:27:18,000
It's honestly been...

4514
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:19,480
It's been really fun.

4515
03:27:19,720 --> 03:27:20,540
I have to say.

4516
03:27:20,600 --> 03:27:23,640
It's actually been very, very fun so far.

4517
03:27:23,840 --> 03:27:24,280
And...

4518
03:27:24,280 --> 03:27:26,100

It's just nice to like actually like talk about like the DC lore.

4524
03:27:41,280 --> 03:27:44,900
And like the DC comics and the DC shows and stuff like that.

03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:48,160

So it's like nice to know you guys understand my references.

4527
03:27:51,740 --> 03:27:53,420
And even if you like didn't.

4528
03:27:53,480 --> 03:27:56,080
It's because you guys get to learn with me too.

4529
03:27:57,060 --> 03:27:57,840
But yeah.

4530
03:27:57,960 --> 03:27:58,700
Thank you everybody.

4531
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:01,480
I noticed I wanted to do a super chat reading after this.

4532
03:28:01,600 --> 03:28:03,620
But I did read some super chats as we went along.

4533
03:28:03,920 --> 03:28:06,180
But I'm very, very tired right now.

4534
03:28:06,220 --> 03:28:07,180
So I'm going to call it here.

4535
03:28:07,480 --> 03:28:08,600
And rest up.

4536
03:28:08,940 --> 03:28:10,200
But thank you everybody.

4537
03:28:10,540 --> 03:28:13,500
I really enjoyed streaming today for you guys.

4538
03:28:13,580 --> 03:28:14,360
As always everyone.

4539
03:28:14,680 --> 03:28:15,560
Stay hydrated.

4540
03:28:15,920 --> 03:28:16,460
Posture check.

4541
03:28:16,520 --> 03:28:18,400
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4542
03:28:18,500 --> 03:28:19,860
And if you stay up late for me.

4543
03:28:19,960 --> 03:28:20,740
Head to bed.

4544
03:28:20,740 --> 03:28:22,020
Because you deserve it.

4545
03:28:22,320 --> 03:28:23,620
Helldivers 2 tomorrow.

4546
03:28:23,820 --> 03:28:27,040
And I hope that the servers won't be too bad tomorrow.

4547
03:28:27,700 --> 03:28:28,260
Guys.

4548
03:28:28,400 --> 03:28:28,960
Please.

4549
03:28:29,240 --> 03:28:32,080
I request you guys to not go.

4550
03:28:32,380 --> 03:28:34,400
To not play Helldivers 2.

4551
03:28:34,500 --> 03:28:36,740
So I can play on the server.

4552
03:28:41,530 --> 03:28:42,090
Guys.

4553
03:28:43,630 --> 03:28:46,790
I would like to be able to play Helldivers 2 tomorrow.

4554
03:28:47,050 --> 03:28:47,610

Let me have.

4556
03:28:48,770 --> 03:28:50,730
Let me get into the server.

4557
03:28:53,450 --> 03:28:54,010
No.

4558
03:28:54,070 --> 03:28:54,730
You have to.

4559
03:28:54,730 --> 03:28:55,210
Guys.

4560
03:28:55,650 --> 03:28:57,730
If you want to watch me play Helldivers 2.

4561
03:28:57,870 --> 03:29:00,130
You guys need to pause real quick.

4562
03:29:00,250 --> 03:29:02,250
And not play that day.

4563
03:29:04,330 --> 03:29:06,130
You can watch me play.

4564
03:29:06,810 --> 03:29:08,430
Live vicariously through me.

4565
03:29:08,830 --> 03:29:09,390
Anyway.

4566
03:29:09,390 --> 03:29:10,990
