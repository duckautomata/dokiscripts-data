1
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:11,860
I am the most unlucky PC person in the world!

2
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,240
SHOWER!!!

3
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,060
Okay...

4
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,100
For those....

5
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,360
For those...it's not over by the way!

6
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,420
Cause I found out something!

7
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
But let me go from the very...

8
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,600
Not the very beginning, but from where we left off.

9
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,980
So, you guys know how The first RAM set I bought It was faulty.

10
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,520
Hehe!

11
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,080
I took my PC over because I gave up.

12
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,440
I gave up trying to fix it myself.

13
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,240
Never again will I ever fix PCs by myself.

14
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,200
I give up.

15
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,820
I give up.

16
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,060
But the second set of RAM was also faulty.

17
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,500
How have I managed to buy two faulty RAMs?

18
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,460
Two sets from two different brands.

19
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:19,560
And the PC people were so confused because I was waiting because they're like, alright, we're gonna We're gonna check what's up with this RAM that you just bought today.

20
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:29,060
So I was like, okay Can I go out and like get dinner slash lunch because I didn't eat lunch today So I ate lunch and dinner at the same time.

21
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,220
Um, and then yeah, yeah, you can go out.

22
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,680
We're just gonna check what's up So then also I'm like getting up because I need to turn on the lights.

23
00:03:36,860 --> 00:04:03,120
So give me a sec It's like echoey because there's like almost no furniture in my room I need out more So then I came back from after getting lunch slash dinner And then I just see like all the tech guys surrounding my PC I thought that was weird because you know Usually it's like divided like there's tech guys on one side of the room There's tech guys on the other side of the room,

24
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,560
but all the tech guys were around my PC.

25
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,440
So I was like, that's weird That's weird.

26
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:09,920
That's fucking weird.

27
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,040
Like, why were they...

28
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,460
Why were they there?

29
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,420
That's not a good sign.

30
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,180
That's...

31
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,440
That's not a good sign.

32
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,160
So then they were like, discussing about what was going on with my PC.

33
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,460
And...

34
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,640
And they were like, Yeah, so...

35
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,300
Your second set of RAM is also faulty.

36
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,020
And I was like...

37
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,540
Twice in a row?

38
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,840
I was like...

39
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,280
Twice in a row?

40
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,340
And like...

41
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,540
How is that possible?

42
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,620
Cause like one of the...

43
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,120
The guy that sold me the fucking upgrade.

44
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,140
Yesterday.

45
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,320
The one that was like...

46
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,640
Yeah, the guy that was like, oh, you can buy this one.

47
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,120
Or you can buy the other one.

48
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,340
And it's just $20 more, but it's an upgrade.

49
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,020
So then they were like...

50
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,760
He was there.

51
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,600
He was there.

52
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,820
Around the circle of fucking tech people surrounding my PC.

53
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,780
And he was like...

54
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,440
Yeah, I sold you this yesterday.

55
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
And it was defective.

56
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,800
But then this one is defective too.

57
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,300
So then I was like...

58
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,820
So they were like...

59
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,280
Yeah, it's very rare.

60
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,580
And I was like...

61
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,540
What do you mean?

62
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,880
And they were like...

63
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,360
It's very rare...

64
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,420
That like...

65
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,540
You would get two sets of defective RAM...

66
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,220
In a row.

67
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
And so they were like...

68
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,140
It might be your motherboard...

69
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,700
Is slowly killing your RAM.

70
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,960
Cause like how else would you have...

71
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,040
Two sets of defective RAM?

72
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,440
Your motherboard might have fried it or something.

73
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,180
Or like...

74
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,380
It might be slowly killing it.

75
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,700
I was like...

76
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,440
What do you mean?

77
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,460
So they were like... Alright, we're gonna...

78
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,020
So they were like...

79
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,320
Yeah, we're trying to figure it out.

80
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,240
Because it's not very common.

81
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,180
That like...

82
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,620
You would get two defective RAM in a row.

83
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,680
It's very very rare for that to happen.

84
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,900
And I'm like...

85
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,840
Clearly you haven't met me.

86
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,080
If anything can happen...

87
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,180
I'll do it.

88
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,840
If anything can happen...

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,480
That's very bad for your PC.

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,220
That's why I'm here.

91
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,940
So they were like...

92
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,640
Alright, we're gonna like grab a...

93
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,040
Cause like they checked that RAM...

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,100
On a different PC.

95
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,820
And they were like... Yeah, this RAM is defective.

96
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,080
They didn't just check it on my PC.

97
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,340
They checked it on other PCs to make sure.

98
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,280
So they were like...

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,020
Alright, we're gonna get the RAM test.

100
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,100
The RAM test kit.

101
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,440
To make sure your motherboard is okay.

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,780
And it's not...

103
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,880
Your motherboard is not killing every RAM that you put in.

104
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,060
Um...

105
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,200
So I was like...

106
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,500
Okay, we're gonna stress test it.

107
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
So we're not...

108
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, it's all under warranty by the way.

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,300
So we're gonna...

110
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,980
That's why I'm still going back to that place.

111
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,140
Because it was free.

112
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,220
The swaps are free.

113
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,180
So they're like...

114
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,880
Alright, we're gonna do a RAM stress test.

115
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,960
So you don't kill the rest of our stock of RAM.

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,080
Cause like you know...

117
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,440
They have to keep replacing the RAM.

118
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,140
So they're like...

119
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,240
We're just gonna get like...

120
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,000
One of our test kits.

121
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,300
So you don't keep killing our RAM.

122
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,400
So they went through a stress test on it.

123
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,240
On the motherboard.

124
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,340
And they're like...

125
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,640
The RAM...

126
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,320
The RAM test kit...

127
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,520
Passed the test.

128
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,980
So it's not a motherboard issue.

129
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,380
I guess it's just your RAM.

130
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,540
You just got fault defective RAM.

131
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,860
So they're like... Alright, we're gonna try...

132
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,980
The third set of RAM.

133
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,620
And then we're gonna see...

134
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,520
How it goes.

135
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,360
We're gonna see...

136
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,140
If your third set of RAM...

137
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,680
Is gonna make it.

138
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,420
And they're like...

139
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,640
Are you sure you didn't like...

140
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,160
Mix and match your RAMs?

141
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,460
I was like... No I didn't.

142
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,200
I did not do that.

143
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,160
My chat has yelled at me not to mix and match RAM.

144
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,540
I'm pretty sure.

145
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,880
And they're like... Okay.

146
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,800
They were trying to figure out...

147
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,260
Did I accidentally fry it?

148
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,040
But I was like... No I didn't.

149
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,140
I'm pretty sure I didn't mix and match it.

150
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,920
My chat yelled at me...

151
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,000
Not to do that.

152
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,020
So I didn't.

153
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,560
But I didn't say my chat.

154
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,620
I know I didn't.

155
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,040
But they were like... Are you sure?

156
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,480
And I was like... Yeah I'm sure.

157
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,960
Because they were trying to figure out...

158
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,460
How the fuck...

159
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,020
Did this happen?

160
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,220
No I didn't.

161
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,420
I didn't turn it on.

162
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,820
But I did like...

163
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,380
I mean I did turn it on.

164
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,460
But I accidentally...

165
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,880
Had my outlet plugged in.

166
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,260
And then so like...

167
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,680
So then I was like...

168
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,720
They're like... Okay.

169
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
So they were trying to figure it out.

170
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,680
And...

171
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,080
Uh...

172
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,780
So they were like...

173
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,000
We're gonna like...

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,740
Put the third set in there.

175
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,580
So then they put the third set in there.

176
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,800
And...

177
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
They were like...

178
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,880
We're gonna stress test this to make sure it worked.

179
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,140
And I was like...

180
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,640
Okay.

181
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,620
So I had to wait for a long time.

182
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,140
At the PC store.

183
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,480
Because they were stress testing.

184
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,360
To make sure fully...

185
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,500
That it would work.

186
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,440
And it was okay!

187
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,300
It worked!

188
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:57,840
Yay!

189
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,280
I have 64 gigabytes of RAM!

190
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,820
And then I came home.

191
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,840
And then I plugged in everything.

192
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,000
And then...

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,520
I realized...

194
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,260
Oh my sound settings might be messed up.

195
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,940
Right now.

196
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,020
And then...

197
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,460
I looked at my sound settings.

198
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,780
And do you know what I had to look at?

199
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,760
You...

200
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,260
Especially how unlucky I am.

201
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,980
I'll show you guys what I saw.

202
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,780
The moment I...

203
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,020
The moment I went...

204
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,360
Into...

205
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,900
Went into my sound settings.

206
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,280
Because...

207
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,180
What...

208
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,340
Showed its face to me.

209
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:49,190
The moment I plugged...

210
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,650
Everything in.

211
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,090
What else could go wrong?

212
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,610
Doki?

213
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,730
I wonder what else that could go wrong...

214
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,990
In my life!

215
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,870
What a good question!

216
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,770
Oh my god.

217
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,950
Are you fucking kidding me?

218
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,470
Oh my god.

219
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,330
Are you fucking...

220
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,490
Did my download stop?

221
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,390
Give me a sec.

222
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,150
My folder froze.

223
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,550
This is what I saw.

224
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,130
This is...

225
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,750
For some reason...

226
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,930
For some reason...

227
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,970
After all of that...

228
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,330
For some...

229
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,370
Fucking reason!

230
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,870
My windows...

231
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,450
Unactivated itself!

232
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,240
It unactivated itself!

233
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,180
So I...

234
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,860
I don't know what to do!

235
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,560
I don't know what to do!

236
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,580
And so...

237
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,540
Yeah!

238
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,050
By the way, none of the extra keys worked!

239
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,230
I don't know why!

240
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,950
I don't know...

241
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,690
None of the extra keys worked!

242
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,730
So be the king!

243
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,740
I was panicking!

244
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,580
I was like...

245
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,260
Oh no!

246
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,880
My windows are unactivated!

247
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,420
So I paid $50...

248
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,520
To get a new key!

249
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,620
But then I realized...

250
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,680
It didn't work!

251
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,900
It didn't work!

252
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,170
It didn't work!

253
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,930
So my windows are still...

254
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,090
So my windows are still...

255
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,030
And I sent in an SOS...

256
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,350
And I sent in an SOS...

257
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,530
To hide it and being like...

258
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,150
I need a new key!

259
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,870
I need a new key!

260
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,970
I need a new key!

261
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,880
I need a new key!

262
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,980
I bought the official one!

263
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,020
Because...

264
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,700
Because I don't want any...

265
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,280
I don't do anything illegal!

266
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,720
I was like...

267
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,920
I was scared!

268
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,900
I was like...

269
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,960
What if the cheaper sites don't work?

270
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,700
Maybe I should go with the official site!

271
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,980
The official Microsoft website!

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,380
To buy it!

273
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,080
And then I was like...

274
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,000
But it didn't work!

275
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,040
I even went on the official site!

276
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,700
It didn't work!

277
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,520
When you overfill your PC...

278
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,440
This can occur...

279
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,500
But it goes away!

280
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Thank you!

281
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,280
Thank you!

282
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,730
So...

283
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,250
I panicked!

284
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,610
And I spent another $50!

285
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,030
I spent...

286
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,510
$50!

287
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,550
Anyway...

288
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,050
I don't know...

289
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,870
I am truly the most...

290
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,090
Unlucky...

291
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,390
PC person in the world!

292
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,750
I...

293
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,230
I'll never have good...

294
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,430
PC times!

295
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,870
I'll always have...

296
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,250
PC issues!

297
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,270
No matter what I do!

298
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,630
No matter where I go!

299
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,750
The PC...

300
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,650
Will always haunt me!

301
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,850
But hey...

302
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,470
I have 64 memory now!

303
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,270
That's pretty cool!

304
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,110
But guys...

305
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,750
Despite all of that...

306
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,110
Guys...

307
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,230
Despite all of that though...

308
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,950
Guys look...

309
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,230
Look guys...

310
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,310
Despite all the struggle...

311
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,430
I went through...

312
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,170
Guys look...

313
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,610
I only have...

314
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,090
It only uses...

315
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,500
telesh où But guys...

316
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,080
Guys look!

317
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,120
I guess it was just 36% this time...

318
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,760
Laugh

319
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:48,460
I'm sorry that I've been plagued with PC issues for three years now.

320
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,640
I won't lie, your whole ordeal is super impressive.

321
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,460
So, uh, funds for your Uber, food, key, and headpads.

322
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,780
64 gigabytes, gang.

323
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,460
Let's go!

324
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,240
Thank you for the Akasupa.

325
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,180
Thank you, thank you, Shady.

326
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,440
I really appreciate it.

327
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,940
It's just... I think, like, this has been the worst it's ever been for me.

328
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,540
Because it's, like, a build-up, you know?

329
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,340
So, like, it kept building up more and more and more and more.

330
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,400
When it came to PC problems.

331
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,980
And, like, that... the past two days was, like, my breaking point.

332
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
It's not about the RAM anymore.

333
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:39,400
It's about how unlucky I have been for the past three to four years.

334
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,600
When it comes to PC issues.

335
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,750
It's like... it's like... that was my breaking point.

336
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,410
It was actually a sigh.

337
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,630
I know.

338
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,510
I always worry.

339
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,670
Because I know it's, like, super annoying, too, for you guys.

340
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,270
Because I always have to, like, reschedule stuff.

341
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,710
And, like, I always feel, like, really scared and stuff.

342
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,530
Being like, oh, no.

343
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,770
You guys give up your time for me.

344
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,030
And then, like, I can't stream.

345
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,150
So I always get really nervous and scared whenever stuff like this happens.

346
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,310
Because I hate it when I can't control what's going on.

347
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,450
And I feel really bad.

348
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,510
But I do hope... I do hope you guys are okay with it.

349
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,130
Okay with the little issues that's going on.

350
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,830
Why does this happen to me?

351
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,380
I don't understand.

352
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,240
How do I keep...

353
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,940
How does this keep happening?

354
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,840
I just... I don't understand.

355
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,680
That's the worst part.

356
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,860
When will it stop?

357
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,080
Oh, my God.

358
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,020
Anyway.

359
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
Anyway.

360
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,300
Yeah.

361
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,420
I think... I think we're okay now.

362
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,980
By the way.

363
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,820
My download...

364
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,700
My downloads folder is, like, frozen.

365
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,100
There.

366
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,880
And, like, I don't know how to...

367
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,920
I don't...

368
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,220
I can't close it.

369
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,440
And it's not...

370
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,700
Oh, there it is.

371
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay.

372
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,360
Okay.

373
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,720
I'm going to force quit it.

374
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,940
Force quit.

375
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,100
End task.

376
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,950
Oh.

377
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,370
My...

378
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,710
The bottom thing is gone.

379
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,590
My task bar is gone.

380
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,070
Where did my task bar go?

381
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,570
Oh.

382
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,430
Oh.

383
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,770
I can't swap.

384
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,790
Where did my task bar go?

385
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,070
I...

386
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,010
I...

387
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,350
Where did it go?

388
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,150
I force quit the downloads folder.

389
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,130
I force quit the Windows Explorer.

390
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,710
And my task bar is gone.

391
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,450
Where did...

392
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,930
Where did it go?

393
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,800
It's gone.

394
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,820
It's...

395
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,400
I don't know what I did.

396
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,160
Wait a bit.

397
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
It's not coming back, guys.

398
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,760
It's not coming back.

399
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,220
Next scene.

400
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,200
Thank you for the super chat.

401
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,580
Thank you.

402
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,000
Thank you.

403
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,220
It's a form of entertainment.

404
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,920
Thank God.

405
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,280
Okay.

406
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,120
I'm glad you guys are entertained by my pain.

407
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,360
Because at least somebody is enjoying it.

408
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,100
Thank you for the super chat.

409
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,880
Thank you.

410
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,640
Thank you.

411
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:45,960
Okay.

412
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,180
Windows R.

413
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,980
Windows R?

414
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,060
What did you make me do?

415
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,820
What did you make me do?

416
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,860
What did...

417
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,260
Oh.

418
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,520
Oh.

419
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:57,760
Oh.

420
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,740
Oh.

421
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,300
My desktop is gone.

422
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,220
Where did my desktop go?

423
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,560
Where did it go?

424
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,620
Where

425
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,710
did my desktop go?

426
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,710
My God, what did I do?

427
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,310
What did I do?

428
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,830
What did I do?

429
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,570
I don't think...

430
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,560
I don't think I was supposed to do that.

431
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,760
Oh no!

432
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,180
Time from where?

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
I can't access anything!

434
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,920
Alt...

435
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,900
Ctrl...

436
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,660
Shift...

437
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,300
B Nothing came up.

438
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,020
I was lied to.

439
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,000
Nothing came up.

440
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,620
What did I press?

441
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,620
W-WR doesn't show up anywhere!

442
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,980
Wait, it just... it's the task manager!

443
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,480
Oh no, why did I do that?

444
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,980
I have the task manager out!

445
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,000
Now...

446
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,140
It's gone!

447
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,440
My desktop is gone!

448
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,080
My... my desktop...

449
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,880
It's gone!

450
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,210
It's gone!

451
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,570
Explorer... EXE...

452
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,870
Okay, I still have my...

453
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,610
Guys, I still... I still have...

454
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,130
I still have...

455
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,790
Oh, there's no Explorer EXE.

456
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,830
How do I...

457
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,250
How do I find Explorer EXE?

458
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,130
Guys, this is the stress test part.

459
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,470
Guys, this is...

460
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,070
Guys, I'm very stressed out.

461
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,770
Guys, I'm very stressed out, guys.

462
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,170
This is... this is the stress test...

463
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,270
They... they visited the studio stress...

464
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,350
...the Tokyo stress test.

465
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,210
WHERE DO I GET FILE?

466
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,090
Where do I... where do I get...

467
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,390
Everything is just a black...

468
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,190
Not black, it's actually gray.

469
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,350
Everything is just a gray space.

470
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,390
File in the ribbon of the task manager.

471
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,630
What about the manager?

472
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,930
What about the ribbon?

473
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,190
There's no file?

474
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,150
Where are you seeing this file that you speak of?

475
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,810
I see details.

476
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,050
I see app history.

477
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,630
Okay, let me see if I can pull up.

478
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,410
Maybe I can pull up Winoki plus R type.

479
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:06,050
I don't look for run new tasks next to processes.

480
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,870
Oh, run new task.

481
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,090
Oh, okay.

482
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,610
And then what do I type?

483
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,710
What do I...

484
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,770
Okay, explorer.

485
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,810
Okay, then explorer exe.

486
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,990
Okay, open.

487
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,020
Okay, guys, I learned my lesson.

488
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,980
Guys, I did it.

489
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:37,220
Okay, for those who don't know, I accidentally deleted Windows Explorer.

490
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,820
Now I know.

491
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,920
Do not end task for Windows Explorer.

492
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:59,080
Because I thought... I saw Windows Explorer.

493
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,500
Underneath Windows Explorer was my downloads folder.

494
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,860
And my downloads folder was...

495
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,820
And my downloads folder was next to Windows Explorer... was underneath Windows Explorer.

496
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,860
So I was like, okay, I'm gonna end Windows Explorer.

497
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,020
Because Windows Explorer comprised the frozen downloads folder.

498
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,280
But little did I know... little did I know, it ended my entire desktop.

499
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,900
You guys wanna know, like, what it looks like?

500
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:45,260
You should go to task manager and go to Windows Explorer and end it.

501
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,640
And then you can be trapped in the void like I was.

502
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,000
You can... you can also be trapped in the void like me.

503
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,640
Alright.

504
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,680
Jerry, thank you for the Akasupa.

505
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,920
Thank you, thank you.

506
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,800
Nice, the stress test has begun.

507
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,560
Okay, guys, did you guys enjoy...

508
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,060
Part 1 of the stress test?

509
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,000
I had a great time.

510
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,980
I had a great time.

511
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,820
Part 1 of the stress test.

512
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,060
Anyway, the whole point of the reason why I got the RAM upgrade...

513
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,460
Was so, like, I would stop stuttering.

514
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,180
But it's not just for Apex.

515
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,920
It's for any other future games.

516
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,140
Because if I was stuttering in Apex, I was worried that I was gonna...

517
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,800
I was gonna stutter for other games as well.

518
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,020
So this was the only reason why I was here.

519
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,180
I need, like, my own IT team at this point.

520
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,840
I really... I really do.

521
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,780
Oh my god.

522
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,560
The stress test has successfully stressed Doki the fuck out.

523
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,780
Thank you for the super chat.

524
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,980
Akas, thank you, thank you.

525
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,600
Yeah, that was...

526
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,780
That...

527
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,080
That's pretty stressful.

528
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,900
So did it fix the stuttering?

529
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,620
I don't know.

530
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,120
We're trying it out right now.

531
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,080
I don't know if I wanna play.

532
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,360
Nah.

533
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,380
I'll do Vantage.

534
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,240
I wanna snipe.

535
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,580
Oh my god.

536
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,900
That was so stressful.

537
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,600
Now I learned.

538
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,380
Now I learned.

539
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,320
Do not delete Windows Explorer chat.

540
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,120
Did you guys know that?

541
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,500
Guys.

542
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,040
Did you guys know?

543
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,020
If you close Windows Explorer, you close everything?

544
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,500
Now you do.

545
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,780
Now you do.

546
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,240
My keyboard...

547
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,460
My mouse isn't working.

548
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
Why is my...

549
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,340
Where's my mouse?

550
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,540
Oh.

551
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,060
Okay.

552
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,860
That's like...

553
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,620
That's like...

554
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,340
Is my mouse actually not working now?

555
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,800
Oh my god.

556
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,960
Like.

557
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,540
How...

558
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,280
How is this still going on?

559
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,160
All right.

560
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,220
I have to tie it back in, y'all.

561
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,360
I have to tie it back in.

562
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,400
But it's okay, everything is oka-, everything is almost okay now.

563
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,840
Everything...

564
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,920
I am like doing my fist.

565
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:31,040
You are the reason Inter-Explorer restarts by default instead of terminating Windows...

566
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,700
Thank you for the super chat, Anton.

567
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,840
Anton, thank you, thank you.

568
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,940
Guys, did you guys like the stress test so far, chat?

569
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,980
I did not.

570
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,740
I don't know if you guys know this, but I did not like it.

571
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,160
It was not the best time.

572
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,700
Are you sure?

573
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,840
Did you change the FOV?

574
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,460
Did I?

575
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,180
Let's see.

576
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,020
Nope, it's 100.

577
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,040
It's always been 100.

578
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,020
It's always been that way.

579
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,140
Alright.

580
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,680
I'm stressed now?

581
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,180
Good.

582
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,340
Now you know how I feel.

583
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,280
Are there even people here?

584
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,420
Alright, the ultimate stress test.

585
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,980
Running a wingman.

586
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,880
Oh, guys, I need to... I'm going to breathe.

587
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,020
Guys, I want to say, like, I'm not here for lunch.

588
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,200
It's not even a good time, but a good time.

589
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,460
But I don't think it's even a good time anymore.

590
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,420
Guys, I don't...

591
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,400
Guys, I don't think it's a good time anymore.

592
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,260
I've been stressed.

593
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:49,800
Whoa!

594
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,720
Guys, I'm looking at chat!

595
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:55,800
Whoa!

596
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,440
This is fucked up.

597
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,640
I was reading chat.

598
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,480
Oh, shit.

599
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,800
Okay, he's going to shoot me now.

600
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,500
That's fucking right.

601
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,640
That's fucking right.

602
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,660
Yeah, that's right.

603
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,740
You don't want to come to me now, huh?

604
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,980
Now I hear.

605
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,040
Now I hear.

606
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,280
Wow!

607
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,660
Okay...

608
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,880
Okay...

609
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,300
Fuck you, I'm going to come back and kill you.

610
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:34,820
What's your name?

611
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,740
What's your name?

612
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,620
This is not fair.

613
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,020
I didn't think he was actually going to come back!

614
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,640
I didn't...

615
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,920
How is I supposed to know he actually came back?

616
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,820
I thought he got like intimidated.

617
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,620
What was his name?

618
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,540
I already forgot his name.

619
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,180
What was his name chat?

620
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,580
I already forgot.

621
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,080
But now I'm gonna remember.

622
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,160
Now I'm gonna remember.

623
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,220
Now I will remember his name.

624
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,800
What was your name?

625
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,600
What was your name?

626
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,360
Is that him?

627
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,240
That was him.

628
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,080
Okay.

629
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,640
Alright.

630
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,340
He'll come back.

631
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,840
He's gonna come back.

632
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,400
And I'm gonna kill him with his own weapon.

633
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,260
So I'll grab this too.

634
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,660
I'm gonna kill him with his own fucking weapon.

635
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,420
That's right.

636
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,920
This is personal.

637
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,180
He was generosity.

638
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,540
He wasn't like, how do you blow bubbles?

639
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,920
Then who's this other Pathfinder?

640
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,920
There's two Pathfinders?

641
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
Like who the fuck was this other guy?

642
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,560
Okay.

643
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,300
Okay.

644
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,320
We need one more mozab.

645
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,060
Yeah, but I don't have the other mozab.

646
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,340
Isn't two Pathfinders?

647
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,200
I don't feel the stutters yet.

648
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,920
So that's good news.

649
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,680
My frame seems to be consistent.

650
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,800
So like, that's good.

651
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,520
That's what we like to see.

652
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,580
We like consistency here.

653
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,520
I just still can't believe it.

654
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,540
Like, it's been like three months of like...

655
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:46,160
PC problems and like, you know, you would think like after like the first month, it'll be over but like I even I managed to impress myself because two sets of faulty rams of two different brands being defective back-to-back, like, how is that possible?

656
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,180
It's actually unreal.

657
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,420
I don't have ammo.

658
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,480
I...

659
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,740
Well, this is my ammo.

660
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,240
This is my ammo.

661
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,240
And it was worth it.

662
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,720
Oh, he's so low!

663
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,100
No!

664
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,780
Run!

665
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,720
Oh wait, that's my teammate.

666
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,680
Generosity is my teammate, guys.

667
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,380
Oh, he's fucked.

668
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
He's so fucked.

669
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,600
No!

670
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,140
It's alright.

671
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,400
God damn it.

672
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,000
I was not expecting it.

673
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,500
Okay, wait.

674
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,220
Actually, now that like my frames are okay.

675
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm gonna...

676
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:25,800
Okay, wait.

677
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Actually, now that like my frames are okay.

678
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,680
I uncapped my frames.

679
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,380
Give me a sec.

680
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,780
We're uncapping frames now.

681
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,240
Okay, delete.

682
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,520
Okay, delete.

683
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:31,920
All right, guys.

684
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,020
All right, guys.

685
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,140
Now that like I have no stutters, I'm gonna uncap real fast.

686
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,880
All right, I'm gonna do it.

687
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,400
Actually, no.

688
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,040
I'm gonna uncap to 240.

689
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,600
All right.

690
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,780
Guys, this is it.

691
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,600
This is the ultimate stress test.

692
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,820
This is...

693
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,140
This is gonna be so wrong.

694
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,280
No!

695
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,460
No!

696
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,260
It's gonna be okay!

697
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,980
This is the ultimate stress... I told you it's a stress test.

698
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,300
I told you.

699
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,860
Daniel, thank you for the super chat.

700
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,200
Thank you.

701
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,700
Thank you.

702
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,380
I'll suggest you to start using two PC streaming setup.

703
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,420
It could help PC-kun reduce burden for stream with Skin Suit and gaming.

704
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,700
Thank you for the super chat.

705
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,080
Thank you.

706
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,600
Thank you.

707
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,260
I don't have two cuppy holes.

708
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,100
The one thing that's stopping me now...

709
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,280
I only have one cuppy hole.

710
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,380
How would I fit two?

711
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,600
I only have the space for one!

712
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,000
I don't have two cuppy holes!

713
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,960
For two PCs!

714
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,440
You can get a new desk, you know.

715
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,300
Okay, the amount of money I have spent...

716
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,480
I have spent on like...

717
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,620
PC stuff in general.

718
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,960
I am not buying a new desk.

719
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,460
Not this month.

720
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:19,460
Maybe I'll look into it in the next couple of months, but I have went beyond my fucking living budget right now.

721
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:37,640
Like, I spent so much on uber, on uber PC, and it's just life, surviving, moving.

722
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,860
I'm gonna think about the new desk.

723
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,200
I'll think about a new desk in the next couple of months.

724
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,640
I need to like, I need to like be in a better place.

725
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:50,760
I need to like, I need to like be in a better place.

726
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,820
I need it.

727
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,720
And, and, guys.

728
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:04,120
For those who didn't watch the earlier, the VOD earlier this morning, I was so stressed out I went to Korean BBQ.

729
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,740
By myself.

730
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,520
And then a lot of people were like, that's sad.

731
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,500
Haha!

732
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,400
I'm just like...

733
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,900
I'm just like...

734
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,660
I needed it.

735
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,740
I needed it.

736
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,560
I didn't eat a Korean barbeque!

737
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,580
I haven't done that.

738
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,060
By the way, the leftover meat is still in my fucking fridge.

739
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,460
It's still...

740
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,840
I forgot my rice!

741
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,440
That's like the saddest part!

742
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,120
I didn't...

743
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:43,820
I asked the lady to pack up my ba... like to pack up my rice because I didn't want to...

744
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,580
Oh hey, that's cool.

745
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,980
Hey, it's like a little ride.

746
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,620
Yippee!

747
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,680
I asked the server to pack up my...

748
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,220
Oh, I'm a third wheel on this date.

749
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,380
I asked the server to pack up...

750
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,500
Oh my god, her fucking date is on console?

751
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,340
Oh my god, so they can't even get on Discord?

752
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,960
Sorry, I got a little distracted.

753
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:04,800
But...

754
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,660
So...

755
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,000
Jesus Christ, I feel so awkward here.

756
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,820
I feel like a third wheel right now.

757
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,980
You are a addicted.

758
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,660
Bro, this guy is shooting his shot.

759
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,400
Bro, this guy is shooting his shot.

760
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,460
On this map, it's weird too.

761
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,240
Like, I don't use your thinker, but I have a lot of loot, don't.

762
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,900
Yeah, um...

763
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,520
I don't know what you're talking about, because I'm a fully engaged...

764
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,500
And...

765
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:40,900
Who asked?

766
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,880
I have the bruiser off to you.

767
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,240
And I have the roller optics on this arse.

768
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,280
Ohhhhhhh!

769
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,320
You're doing playful flirting right now.

770
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,780
And you're like...

771
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,260
Who asked?

772
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,240
Help the bro out!

773
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,900
Oh, I could make it awkward.

774
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,140
I could make it awkward.

775
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,760
Do I make it awkward?

776
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,840
He's so in.

777
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,680
He's so in!

778
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,160
Is this on right?

779
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,560
I don't know.

780
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,660
Don't make it awkward!

781
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,500
Help the bro out!

782
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,840
It literally...

783
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,300
This is actually a fucking...

784
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,020
Gamer date right now.

785
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,200
Little does

786
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,080
The guy know

787
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,440
3k people are watching him!

788
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,280
Listen to him fumble the fact...

789
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,700
Can you guys hear him well?

790
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,280
Or should I boost it louder?

791
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,760
Louder.

792
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,040
Everyone's got favorites.

793
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,700
And that's mine.

794
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,300
I'll type something in when they talk again.

795
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,500
Are you and Peter still together?

796
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,740
Yeah.

797
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,320
Right next to me playing...

798
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,560
Warcraft.

799
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,160
Did you hear?

800
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,910
Did you?

801
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,740
I can't believe!

802
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,740
Holy shit!

803
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,120
The first thing...

804
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,820
Oh shit!

805
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,200
No fucking way!

806
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,200
No fucking way!

807
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,620
Are you and Peter still together?

808
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,260
Are you and Peter still together?

809
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,540
Are you and Peter still together?

810
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,220
Oh my god!

811
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,640
Oh my god!

812
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,760
Yeah, he's like right next to me right now.

813
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,720
Yeah,

814
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,640
he's like right next to me right now.

815
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,000
He actually stopped talking!

816
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,700
Oh my god!

817
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,640
Oh my god!

818
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,060
It's...

819
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,960
Arrested beast again!

820
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,340
Arrested beast again!

821
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,940
For what?

822
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,980
Wait!

823
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,770
He actually left!

824
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,050
Afterwards!

825
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,990
Oh my god!

826
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,010
I don't want to say anything!

827
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,430
That is so awkward!

828
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,190
Holy shit!

829
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,450
That's actually so awkward!

830
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,170
Who wants to say anything after that?

831
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,110
Dang.

832
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,110
I'm just kidding.

833
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,630
I know.

834
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,030
I'm sorry.

835
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,710
I DC'd as soon as I finished that sentence.

836
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,870
Oh my god!

837
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,910
Even he was like, that's so awkward!

838
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,090
I just saw your series of posts that I thought were kind of awkward.

839
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,770
Like last week or something.

840
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,510
Wow!

841
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,230
Calling me weird?

842
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,850
If I was a republician, I would shoot you.

843
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,430
I mean...

844
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:05,930
That's so funny.

845
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:11,150
But the one that got me was when you posted, what's your type?

846
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,910
And then it was like, I don't have a type.

847
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,830
And then it was like, men who are a little bit gay.

848
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,070
And then it dropped.

849
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:18,870
What the fuck!

850
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,470
I can't believe you're calling me out.

851
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,470
What the fuck!

852
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,070
I can't even play the game!

853
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,750
I can't!

854
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,630
Holy shit!

855
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,310
What the...

856
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,570
What the fuck!

857
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:46,850
I have no shields.

858
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,490
Because I could not lose for any of this.

859
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,870
Holy shit!

860
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,270
Holy shit!

861
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,410
Holy shit!

862
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,170
I can't play!

863
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,510
I can't play properly!

864
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,270
I can't play properly!

865
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:06,590
Bro!

866
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,410
Oh my god!

867
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,270
Oh my god!

868
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,670
I hate this game!

869
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:17,950
Bro!

870
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,370
This is mad!

871
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,530
I feel so mad for him!

872
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,610
He's like stalking her!

873
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,450
He's like stalking her!

874
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:28,670
He's like stalking her!

875
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,550
Are you and Peter still together?

876
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,370
I can't!

877
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,730
I can't!

878
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,110
Oh no!

879
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,210
Oh no!

880
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,610
Not all of us know about salt water.

881
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,190
Okay, wait.

882
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:52,750
So...

883
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,930
Salt like a good friend of yours?

884
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,230
Salt like

885
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,640
a good friend of yours?

886
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,460
Was he trying to shoot a shot at you?

887
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,900
Was he trying to shoot a shot at you?

888
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,140
She is oblivious.

889
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,020
She is actually oblivious.

890
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,060
No!

891
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,280
That guy!

892
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,640
The moment he asked are you and Peter still together?

893
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,480
He was gauging.

894
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,620
He was 100%...

895
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,320
Oh wait, is that a window?

896
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,500
Goodbye.

897
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,720
There's no way!

898
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,980
Oh shit!

899
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,560
I died!

900
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,120
I'm sorry!

901
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,360
No!

902
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,700
I died of cringe.

903
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,720
Chat, I died of cringe.

904
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,820
I can't!

905
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,740
Give me a second to be in a room right now!

906
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,380
I died of cringe right now.

907
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,180
Okay, I'm back.

908
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,380
I'm back.

909
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,800
Dies of cringe.

910
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,560
I like how she was like, no!

911
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,420
And I'm like, bro, this med literally asked if...

912
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:32,940
Literally is asking about her taste of guys and everything.

913
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,760
There's no way.

914
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,560
There's no...

915
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,920
Cringe is so shocking.

916
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,140
I'm just farming.

917
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,940
Bro, he keeps DCing.

918
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,660
I'm gonna go get that.

919
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,620
No shock.

920
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,200
No shock.

921
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,480
You guys hear it properly by the way.

922
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,620
Please.

923
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,120
Oh my weird squad.

924
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,840
Cops in Discord.

925
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,280
Holy shit.

926
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,420
Oh my god, why is my thing over there?

927
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,360
It's okay.

928
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:12,880
Wow!

929
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,140
Guys, it was not okay.

930
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,240
It was not okay.

931
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,760
Oh my god.

932
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,000
It was not okay.

933
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,060
Oh my god.

934
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,180
You can't live for four seconds!

935
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,100
What the fuck?

936
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,560
Alright, it's okay.

937
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,140
Now she can die.

938
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,920
I'm alive, though.

939
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,420
That's all that matters.

940
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,930
I'm alive.

941
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,070
I'm alive.

942
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:06,950
Oh, please don't tell me I'm gonna die.

943
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,450
Goodbye.

944
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,170
Goodbye.

945
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:18,830
Goodbye.

946
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:21,170
Run for us.

947
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,570
Oh!

948
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,030
Oh!

949
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,930
Why did his optics move like that?

950
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,830
Doki.

951
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:35,290
The absent cake is what I'm seeing right now.

952
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:38,370
What?

953
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,650
What do you mean?

954
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,950
I'm just running.

955
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,290
I'm just fucking running.

956
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,850
What do you mean?

957
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:53,210
How am I cheating if I'm running?

958
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:56,550
Oh, did I snap to somebody?

959
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:01,910
Alright.

960
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,730
There we go.

961
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,390
Hide your aimbot eye!

962
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,770
That's what I'm saying.

963
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,550
Oh god.

964
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,350
They really should get Discord.

965
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,020
They really...

966
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:33,140
I want to shoot at this team, but I have no high ground for it.

967
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,100
And I feel very unsafe being here.

968
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,340
But the team...

969
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:46,440
I'm literally a third wheel right now to the most awkward one-sided relationship ever.

970
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,140
I did not expect this to be my stress test.

971
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:50,960
I...

972
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,400
No, I'm getting stressed over different circumstances right now.

973
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,340
Like, when I say stress test, this is not what I meant.

974
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,720
This is not what I meant.

975
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,140
Putting me in this most awkward scenario ever of the most one-sided relationship.

976
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,060
Where this man literally asked the girl if she was still with Peter.

977
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,000
Like...

978
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,900
That is so fucked.

979
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,620
That is action.

980
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,720
This is the true stress test.

981
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,000
Yes.

982
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,520
Oh, I actually made it.

983
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:26,800
Nice.

984
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,460
What?

985
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,020
How does that still hit me?

986
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,520
I had a fucking door.

987
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,580
Alright.

988
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,140
No!

989
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,900
Sami, please!

990
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,200
Okay.

991
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,380
That's fine.

992
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,720
That's fine.

993
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,960
What is that, right?

994
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,160
So this is what you meant by PC stress test.

995
00:47:59,320 --> 00:47:59,780
Don't leave!

996
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,220
Leave, Sami!

997
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,820
Sami's so dead.

998
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,720
Alright.

999
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,380
We are free.

1000
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,280
We are free, guys.

1001
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,360
We are...

1002
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,280
We are free.

1003
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,400
This stress test is his and Peter's.

1004
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,500
My head.

1005
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,940
We are free.

1006
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,360
Jesus Christ.

1007
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,980
Can you...

1008
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,300
Okay we are going to try to hear voice comms.

1009
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:28,800
I mean...

1010
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:28,940
Like...

1011
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,160
I could not focus at all.

1012
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,980
That was like, so hard to focus.

1013
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,280
That was actually so difficult.

1014
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,260
Oh my God.

1015
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,100
Okay.

1016
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,820
Alright, let me turn down sound effects by 70.

1017
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,100
7D.

1018
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,980
And then we will turn it up.

1019
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,260
Oh my god.

1020
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,360
And then...

1021
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,240
And then we can turn it up.

1022
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,140
Alright.

1023
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,360
Turn up by...

1024
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,500
Let's see.

1025
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,380
6.2.

1026
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,160
There should be better.

1027
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,300
What a PC stress test.

1028
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:11,820
I know.

1029
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,300
This is not what I expected today.

1030
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,400
I honestly... How am I... Am I not cued?

1031
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,140
If you exit the queue, the queue will be...

1032
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,700
How am I still cued up?

1033
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,000
So this is going to be a Doki fight.

1034
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1035
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,660
Thank you for the super chat fight size.

1036
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,120
Thank you.

1037
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,920
Doki Poki.

1038
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,000
Thank you for magenta soup.

1039
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,620
Thank you.

1040
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,060
Thank you.

1041
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,360
Doki.

1042
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,460
After your issues yesterday, I saw that I was 90% of my memory.

1043
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,560
So I went to buy more RAM.

1044
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,100
But it's way too expensive for me.

1045
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,040
So I looked for other ways to get RAM.

1046
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,800
Did you know that you can download RAM for completely free?

1047
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,400
So I'm doing that.

1048
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,260
Make sure you download several copies too.

1049
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,140
And if your PC tells you that...

1050
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,960
Tells you to not run it anyway, run it.

1051
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,060
Because that's just a lie.

1052
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,500
Your PC doesn't want you to get stuff for free.

1053
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,320
So make sure you download as many as you can so you can fill up your RAM.

1054
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,720
How am I not in the game yet?

1055
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,880
Jesus Christ.

1056
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,820
I'm going to leave match and queue up normally.

1057
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,830
Holy f**k.

1058
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:23,510
That...

1059
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,230
That was stressful.

1060
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:26,890
That really was.

1061
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:27,790
That...

1062
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:29,350
That really...

1063
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,930
That really was very stressful.

1064
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,180
I never... You know, like I joke about these things about actually being the third wheel.

1065
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,180
How do I have zero friends?

1066
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,180
How...

1067
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,580
How...

1068
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,380
How...

1069
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:55,840
How...

1070
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,380
How...

1071
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,280
How...

1072
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,340
How...

1073
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:58,380
How...

1074
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,600
Today truly is... How f**ked can we make Doki?

1075
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,420
How...

1076
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,880
How f**ked up can we give... can we provide?

1077
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,340
Oh my god.

1078
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,000
I'm not soloing this.

1079
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,920
I'm not... Why... I'm not soloing this.

1080
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,520
Why would they do that to me?

1081
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,120
Why would they do that to me?

1082
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:31,640
Why would they do that to me?

1083
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,020
Why would they do that to me?

1084
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,140
The patch came out yesterday!

1085
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,760
I'm not soloing it!

1086
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,520
It's just... It came out yesterday!

1087
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,700
You need to solo.

1088
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,380
Oh my god.

1089
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,540
The funniest thing is...

1090
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:04,780
It's...

1091
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,300
It's bot bot, which is lucky in Chinese tradition.

1092
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,140
Clearly, I didn't... Clearly, I didn't get the memo.

1093
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,360
Oh my god.

1094
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,740
Alright.

1095
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,020
Okay.

1096
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,800
Today will be...

1097
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,460
Today will end on a good day.

1098
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:26,660
Alright.

1099
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,160
We will end on a good day.

1100
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,300
Alright, sound guy.

1101
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,060
Let me know.

1102
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,900
If the sound is a lot better, if I should turn down the sound effects or anything.

1103
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,220
Ben and Jerry's deserve fun.

1104
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,700
You sound like you need it.

1105
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,160
Oh yeah.

1106
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,500
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

1107
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:47,780
Thank you.

1108
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,300
I am definitely going to get ice cream after today.

1109
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,640
After today's stream.

1110
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,500
I definitely need some ice cream.

1111
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,700
Ended on being the champion.

1112
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,020
Look, with how today went...

1113
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:04,760
Like...

1114
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,320
With how it's been going for today.

1115
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,720
That's like a really tall order right now.

1116
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,220
It seems a little too much now.

1117
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,640
Let's not get too crazy here.

1118
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:23,860
Alright.

1119
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:24,720
Fuck it.

1120
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,440
I don't know.

1121
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,200
Let's land here.

1122
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,240
Did my third DC?

1123
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:31,740
How?

1124
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:32,680
What?

1125
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,160
Will I have a regular game?

1126
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,640
Will I?

1127
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,480
Will I have a regular game?

1128
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,920
I fucking left.

1129
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,100
Where's my fucking real game?

1130
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,960
I just want a real game.

1131
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,560
I just wanted...

1132
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,900
Oh my god.

1133
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,800
I wanted to fucking...

1134
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,980
I just wanted to make sure my PC is okay.

1135
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,640
That's it.

1136
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:11,840
Alright.

1137
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,600
Here we go.

1138
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:14,820
Here we go.

1139
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,700
The third wheel to solo or to duo.

1140
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:20,980
Alright.

1141
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,720
Let's see.

1142
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,340
Everything will be fine.

1143
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,060
Everything will be fine.

1144
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,760
I think the super...

1145
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,240
Oh shit.

1146
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,700
It's fine.

1147
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,860
It's fine.

1148
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,240
There's like a guy right here.

1149
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:35,860
But it's fine.

1150
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,640
It's fine.

1151
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,580
Everything is fine.

1152
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
I have my buddy here.

1153
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,400
Derog.

1154
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,340
Because I get to catch your stream.

1155
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,180
I hope you get to enjoy whatever kind of stream you get after this.

1156
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:49,960
Thank you for the super chat.

1157
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:50,460
Thank you.

1158
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,460
What the fuck?

1159
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:51,780
Okay.

1160
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,740
One, two, three.

1161
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,060
Alright.

1162
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,720
Three teams.

1163
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,120
We're a fourth team heading into the fight.

1164
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,320
Guys, please don't come...

1165
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,680
Whoa!

1166
00:54:59,400 --> 00:54:59,840
Whoa!

1167
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,260
Please.

1168
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,360
I'm going through a lot right now.

1169
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,360
Alright.

1170
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,420
Where are they?

1171
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:13,700
Okay.

1172
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,860
We're gonna go from this side.

1173
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,180
Oh!

1174
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,100
And then there's people from this side too.

1175
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,260
Alright.

1176
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,480
That poor man though.

1177
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,440
I'm still thinking about that.

1178
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,520
Like...

1179
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,800
I'm still thinking about...

1180
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,300
Are you and Peter still together?

1181
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,520
And then like...

1182
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,660
The fact that like...

1183
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,420
He...

1184
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,700
He didn't say anything after she said...

1185
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:36,820
Yeah.

1186
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,140
He's like right next to me right now playing World of Warcraft.

1187
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,460
That...

1188
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,760
That shit blew my mind.

1189
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,420
Like I cannot...

1190
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,680
I cannot stop thinking about it.

1191
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,480
I actually can.

1192
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,720
Thank you.

1193
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,640
He's there right here.

1194
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,900
But they can't get to us.

1195
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,180
Whoa!

1196
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,340
Man!

1197
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,460
Open the door!

1198
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:12,720
Oh!

1199
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:14,900
Oh!

1200
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,440
Haha!

1201
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:15,960
Okay.

1202
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:16,440
Nevermind.

1203
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,600
You know what?

1204
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:17,940
Yeah.

1205
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,500
Fuck you guys.

1206
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,800
I don't wanna deal with you guys too.

1207
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,320
Oh.

1208
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,060
What the fuck?

1209
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:24,960
Oh no!

1210
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,440
What?

1211
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,620
If I hit that shot, that would've been so sick though.

1212
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,560
Okay.

1213
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,740
I wish I did hit those...

1214
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,100
That shot.

1215
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:37,880
No!

1216
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,060
Yeah.

1217
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:39,360
It's okay.

1218
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,580
Please.

1219
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,520
No!

1220
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:49,490
It would've been cool if I did hit it.

1221
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,110
Oh wait.

1222
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:51,510
We're back?

1223
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,150
It's...

1224
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:53,230
Oh!

1225
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:54,450
We get like second life.

1226
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,530
I see.

1227
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:56,890
I see.

1228
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:00,510
Wait.

1229
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,430
How the fuck did you die so fast?

1230
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:03,470
What?

1231
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:05,150
How?

1232
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,730
I died before you.

1233
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:09,890
What?

1234
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:12,530
I died before this guy.

1235
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,130
Oh no.

1236
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,270
Am I gonna land on a team?

1237
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:18,370
Oh.

1238
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:23,110
Where?

1239
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,090
Where?

1240
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:27,510
Wait.

1241
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:27,730
What?

1242
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:30,610
Somebody shot me.

1243
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:32,730
I don't like that.

1244
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,710
Who shot me?

1245
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,770
I'm scared I'm gonna get shot to my side.

1246
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:39,870
Okay.

1247
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:44,510
Oh.

1248
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:47,210
God.

1249
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:49,570
I've never been so stressed out before.

1250
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,370
No.

1251
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,290
That's a lie.

1252
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,670
But like...

1253
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,810
That's a lie, but like...

1254
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,230
Why me?

1255
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,250
I don't know why.

1256
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,610
Why is my life like this right now?

1257
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:04,710
Is that shot from behind?

1258
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,690
That was a sentinel shot.

1259
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,150
Oh, okay.

1260
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:11,510
Okay.

1261
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:12,430
Alright.

1262
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:13,310
I'm gonna head closer.

1263
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:16,150
I'm gonna head closer.

1264
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,210
Can I get like a normal team?

1265
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:18,990
Like...

1266
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:19,690
Can I...

1267
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:20,770
Can I get...

1268
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:23,070
Can I get a normal team today?

1269
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:24,950
Holy fuck.

1270
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:27,950
Why is...

1271
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:30,110
Why are my teams like this?

1272
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,810
By the way, I still think this map sucks.

1273
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,130
A lot of people are like, no, it's fun.

1274
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,090
I hate the fucking high high ground.

1275
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,050
High high ground is dog shit.

1276
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:41,770
I hate it.

1277
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:44,770
Wait.

1278
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:45,090
What?

1279
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:45,890
Where did he go?

1280
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,330
Oh, there he is.

1281
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:53,490
Alright.

1282
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:57,330
Come on.

1283
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:57,690
Get closer.

1284
00:58:59,230 --> 00:58:59,970
That's right!

1285
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:01,110
Whoa!

1286
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,390
How does this keep happening?

1287
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,490
Every time I want to be confident!

1288
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:10,530
No!

1289
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,010
No!

1290
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,610
How does this keep happening?

1291
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:13,630
How?

1292
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:16,410
How?!

1293
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,030
I ...

1294
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,950
I don't understand.

1295
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:25,190
How?

1296
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,090
How?!

1297
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,310
Has happened twice!

1298
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:29,510
Bro!

1299
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,690
This is not fair.

1300
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:35,290
This is actually not fair.

1301
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,590
Like, every...

1302
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:38,930
Every time.

1303
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:40,530
This is the second time.

1304
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:41,030
Ugh.

1305
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:43,710
This is actually the second time!

1306
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:50,250
This dreadpun is not my day.

1307
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:53,130
It's not my day at all.

1308
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:59,430
I mean, maybe it'll be easier in rank because it's not E-District.

1309
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:06,170
Because it fucking... I hate Broken Moon, but I hate E-District even more.

1310
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,130
Alright.

1311
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,190
Vantage time.

1312
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:18,970
Oh!

1313
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:21,730
Today you're being blessed by the God.

1314
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:22,670
Thank God!

1315
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:23,730
Thank you!

1316
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,870
Thank you, thank you, Black.

1317
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,660
Alright, here we go.

1318
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,620
Maybe it won't be that bad in rank, you know?

1319
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,660
Maybe it won't be...

1320
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,240
My third D-Seed.

1321
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,700
This is my first ranking of the season!

1322
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,420
This is actually my first ranking of the season!

1323
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:08,820
How did I... How did my Thane leave?

1324
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,170
Ain't no damn way.

1325
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,890
Ain't no way!

1326
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,250
Oh my God.

1327
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:39,150
It truly is... It truly is a day today.

1328
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:44,810
Oh...

1329
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:46,810
Let me grab...

1330
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:47,750
Is there a gun?

1331
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:48,930
Is there any gun?

1332
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,050
Is there one gun?

1333
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:55,050
One measly gun for little old me.

1334
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,030
This game will be normal, surely.

1335
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,350
Alright, guys!

1336
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,930
It's alright!

1337
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:03,210
I got one gun!

1338
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:05,290
I got one gun.

1339
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,670
That's all I asked for.

1340
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:08,150
That's all I wanted.

1341
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:09,510
That's all I wanted.

1342
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:10,190
One gun.

1343
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,130
Now I have two guns!

1344
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,790
I have no idea if there's anybody on us.

1345
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:17,930
Alright, now we know.

1346
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:18,890
Okay.

1347
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:20,730
Okay.

1348
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:23,670
There's people on us.

1349
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,350
Um...

1350
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,110
Um...

1351
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:32,830
Okay.

1352
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:37,930
Okay.

1353
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:47,190
Oh...

1354
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,840
They're, like, here.

1355
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,640
Are you serious?

1356
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,560
Wait, I don't have enough ammo!

1357
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,300
I'm lucky.

1358
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,300
I'm dead.

1359
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,820
Oh my God, this is not great for me.

1360
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,880
This is...

1361
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,360
This is...

1362
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:16,300
I...

1363
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,660
I'll give as many craps as prisoners will take.

1364
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,060
None.

1365
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:22,700
None.

1366
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:23,540
None.

1367
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,700
I...

1368
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,980
I...

1369
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,220
I don't understand.

1370
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,580
I need...

1371
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,420
I'm gonna pee out of sadness.

1372
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,940
I'll be right back.

1373
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,980
I'm gonna sad pee.

1374
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,860
I'm back.

1375
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,500
I...

1376
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,620
I'm back.

1377
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,160
I'm back.

1378
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,280
I'm...

1379
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:31,440
I'm back!

1380
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,480
I'm back!

1381
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,140
I'm back.

1382
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,040
Shirley!

1383
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,420
Shirley!

1384
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,640
This match can't be that bad!

1385
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,400
Shirley!

1386
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,580
My luck will turn around here!

1387
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,620
Okay.

1388
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,580
Okay.

1389
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,300
This time... this time it will be different!

1390
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,400
It will be different!

1391
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:10,820
Alright.

1392
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,500
Is there anybody landing with us?

1393
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,220
Yes, there is!

1394
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,560
A lot of buddies.

1395
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,480
I'm gonna get a guarantee gun first.

1396
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,120
Alright.

1397
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,140
Guarantee gun.

1398
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,520
Guarantee gun.

1399
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:34,580
If you guys didn't know, these lupins are like guarantee guns now.

1400
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:36,780
You know what?

1401
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:37,980
Let's do it for the hipfire.

1402
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:41,400
Oh wait.

1403
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:42,800
Shirley.

1404
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,100
Wow!

1405
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,400
I was fucking around too much!

1406
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,400
Oh my god.

1407
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,740
This sucks.

1408
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,020
Okay.

1409
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:06,380
I got one.

1410
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,500
Where's the last guy?

1411
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,160
Give me your fucking helmet.

1412
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:13,720
I mean, armor.

1413
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,980
Oh my god.

1414
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,220
I scared the shit out of him because I wasn't paying attention!

1415
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,580
To be fair, I never pay attention.

1416
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,740
But like, I was absolutely not paying attention right now.

1417
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,800
I'm not!

1418
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,640
Finally!

1419
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,700
We win our first team fight of the day!

1420
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,520
I think my luck is turning around!

1421
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:40,840
Chat!

1422
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,040
This is it!

1423
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,520
My luck is turning around, everybody!

1424
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,460
This is it!

1425
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,800
I can feel it!

1426
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,840
I can feel it, guys!

1427
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,760
I can feel it!

1428
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,120
Alright.

1429
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,380
Let me go grab this...

1430
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,920
Let me grab this armor thing.

1431
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,160
And then we can go in.

1432
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,580
It can only go up from here, right?

1433
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,380
That's what they say!

1434
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,220
Alright.

1435
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,280
I heard, like, people shooting from there.

1436
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,440
I think.

1437
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:16,920
It's up here?

1438
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,060
Yeah.

1439
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:20,480
Were they shooting up there?

1440
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:23,820
Alright.

1441
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,180
Here we go!

1442
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,600
Haha, JK!

1443
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,680
Didn't I hear shots from here?

1444
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,450
No, it's not looted.

1445
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:40,790
I thought I did.

1446
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:43,930
Alright.

1447
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:45,130
Let's grab some heals.

1448
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:47,190
Let's grab this.

1449
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:50,250
What?

1450
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,150
Where were those shots?

1451
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,110
They were on this side.

1452
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,310
Yeah, what could possibly go wrong?

1453
01:07:59,070 --> 01:07:59,750
You're right.

1454
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:01,670
What could possibly go wrong?

1455
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:04,170
We already got through all the bad luck.

1456
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,830
Surely, like, no more.

1457
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:06,690
No more.

1458
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,810
I won my first team fight.

1459
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,450
So that means there's no more bad luck now.

1460
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,630
After winning the first team fight.

1461
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,410
Them's the rules!

1462
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:16,850
Where?

1463
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:22,920
Where?

1464
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:25,600
Oh.

1465
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,120
Where?

1466
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:34,230
Oh!

1467
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:35,790
Okay.

1468
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:38,870
I was like, where the fuck are they looking at?

1469
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,810
Oh, that's so far.

1470
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:43,710
What the fuck?

1471
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:44,230
I'm gonna loot.

1472
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:46,710
That's so fucking far.

1473
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:48,630
I assumed they would be closer.

1474
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:49,850
I'm gonna craft two.

1475
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:50,970
Yeah!

1476
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:53,630
Yippee!

1477
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:59,490
I'm not running the akimbo anymore.

1478
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,070
They're just bad luck for me these days.

1479
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,790
Haha, I swear.

1480
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:05,230
Unless!

1481
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:08,690
Unless I run double P20!

1482
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:10,450
You know what?

1483
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:13,690
Surely nothing can go wrong if I run double P20.

1484
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:15,050
It's like Christmas!

1485
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:21,090
Alright, let's see.

1486
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:24,650
It's like Christmas!

1487
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,070
Merry Christmas!

1488
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,570
What gives season's greetings to everybody?

1489
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:33,430
Let me fucking scan this now.

1490
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:35,310
Oh, I should have done the ring console.

1491
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,690
Because it's rank.

1492
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:37,650
Oh well.

1493
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,110
I don't care about my teammates that much.

1494
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:44,730
Oh, there's people behind us here.

1495
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,510
I'm gonna fight them.

1496
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:48,310
Let's do it.

1497
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,350
You know what?

1498
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:49,890
Let's do it.

1499
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:50,570
I'm feeling wild.

1500
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:55,250
I feel exceptionally wild today.

1501
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:57,190
I went through so much shit.

1502
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:00,110
I'm fucking ready.

1503
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,360
That's fucking right.

1504
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:07,980
I tagged you.

1505
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,180
What you gonna do, little guy?

1506
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:13,900
You scared now?

1507
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:17,140
Oh.

1508
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:18,780
I shot that late.

1509
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,080
That was some slow reflexes.

1510
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:23,900
What?

1511
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,420
Wait, your friend is so...

1512
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:34,110
Let's see.

1513
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,270
Come on, look at me.

1514
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:37,050
Look at me.

1515
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:38,930
Look at me.

1516
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:43,250
Yeah!

1517
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:45,090
Look at me again!

1518
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:47,570
Look at me again, guys!

1519
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,770
Oh, they don't wanna look at me anymore!

1520
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:53,010
Look at me again!

1521
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:53,630
Keep looking!

1522
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:54,570
Keep looking!

1523
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:56,590
Oh, okay, wait.

1524
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:59,950
Keep looking!

1525
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:02,650
I have one more bullet!

1526
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:06,550
I'm going in.

1527
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:12,810
There you go.

1528
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,290
Wait.

1529
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:16,110
Oh, shit!

1530
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:17,350
I was like, wait a minute.

1531
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,430
Don't you fucking lose this!

1532
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:21,530
They're back!

1533
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:22,310
Everything I did!

1534
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:24,830
I was gonna say!

1535
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:28,870
All right.

1536
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:29,470
Nice.

1537
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:33,190
I'm gonna take this real fast.

1538
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:34,170
Oh, shit!

1539
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:34,910
Wait, what?

1540
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:36,170
How do I still have shields?

1541
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:39,450
Okay.

1542
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:40,710
Everything is fine.

1543
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:42,950
I was...

1544
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:48,830
I would be so mad they actually lost that fucking 3v1 after I did all that.

1545
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:51,090
I would have been so fucking sad.

1546
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:53,070
All right.

1547
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:53,570
Let's see.

1548
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:54,190
Give me that.

1549
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:54,710
Ooh!

1550
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:55,990
What do you have?

1551
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:57,810
Nice.

1552
01:11:58,670 --> 01:11:59,450
Oh, my God.

1553
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,550
Maybe this is it.

1554
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:04,350
Guys, maybe, like, my luck is finally turning around.

1555
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:06,070
I can feel it!

1556
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,690
I can actually feel it!

1557
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:09,730
Did I took the shield core?

1558
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:11,910
Guys, things are going by so fast.

1559
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,510
Now, my brain can't handle it.

1560
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,810
There's so much that my brain actually can't handle.

1561
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:19,770
I can't handle things any more.

1562
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,630
Refresh on hits with ultimate.

1563
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:28,170
Oh, shit!

1564
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:28,850
Yeah, fuck it.

1565
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:29,310
Let's do it.

1566
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,170
I should have done the left side, but it's too late.

1567
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,630
I can't refund it.

1568
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,090
I was not paying attention.

1569
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,750
I was just like, refresh hits?

1570
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:38,750
But I didn't realize it meant, like, uh...

1571
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:40,890
Um...

1572
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:44,110
I didn't realize that, like, um...

1573
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,530
It's not that good.

1574
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,050
Alright.

1575
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,650
Let's see.

1576
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:53,810
Is there any...

1577
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:57,950
What does my eyes see?

1578
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:01,850
What does my sniper eyes see?

1579
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:02,990
Nothing!

1580
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:05,610
I want to scan this.

1581
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:10,110
There's still, like, 12 squads, which is very surprising in this elo.

1582
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:13,730
Oh, my god.

1583
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:15,210
What a day.

1584
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:16,610
What a fucking day.

1585
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:18,730
I feel like I haven't been able to breathe in a while.

1586
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:21,550
I felt like I...

1587
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:24,230
What a fucking day.

1588
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:26,950
It's been a rollercoaster of emotions.

1589
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:29,610
Alright.

1590
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:32,410
Nobody shows up.

1591
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:32,870
Okay?

1592
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,210
Nobody pop up.

1593
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:36,230
Unexpected.

1594
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,610
Okay, everybody?

1595
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:40,630
I'm just having a nice walk.

1596
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:42,530
Who do you scan?

1597
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:45,470
I just want to scan the survey beacon.

1598
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:48,210
To know what's going on.

1599
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:48,810
Oh, my god.

1600
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:50,770
I'm just having a nice walk.

1601
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,090
So, be chill.

1602
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,710
Be chill, everybody.

1603
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:57,250
Okay.

1604
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:59,970
There shouldn't be anybody there.

1605
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,890
Like, what kind of freak would be there?

1606
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:02,530
Anyway.

1607
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:05,450
It's literally the other side of the world.

1608
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:07,770
Wow!

1609
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,840
He's, like, behind here.

1610
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,740
Now I know what kind of freak would be here.

1611
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,660
I was like, what kind of freak would be here?

1612
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,440
Fucking freaks.

1613
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:29,820
Freaks.

1614
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,420
Jesus Christ.

1615
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,300
I found the freak.

1616
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,480
I found him.

1617
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:40,440
Oh, my god.

1618
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,000
They're chasing after this poor guy.

1619
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,700
Oh, my god.

1620
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:44,700
That poor fucking freak.

1621
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,180
He's not deserved.

1622
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:47,920
No, he did.

1623
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,480
He absolutely did.

1624
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:50,280
He scared me.

1625
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,160
He deserved that.

1626
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:51,940
Oh, my god.

1627
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:52,260
Oh, my god.

1628
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,260
Wait.

1629
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:53,300
You're supposed to be the only one in here.

1630
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,340
There should be people down here.

1631
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,880
In this choke.

1632
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:56,760
Oh, I see him.

1633
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:00,540
Alright.

1634
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,460
Oh!

1635
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,820
I didn't hit that!

1636
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:05,880
God damn.

1637
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,580
I thought I did.

1638
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,560
Oh, he's running.

1639
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,260
He's running.

1640
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,640
Come on, little guy.

1641
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,320
Come on!

1642
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,520
Where did he go?

1643
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:20,860
Here we go.

1644
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:21,100
That's it?

1645
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:21,500
Alright.

1646
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:22,120
Let's go.

1647
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:22,180
Look at theplay.

1648
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:22,640
Okay.

1649
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,220
Wait, isn't that the same guy tagged?

1650
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,460
No, that's a different guy.

1651
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:30,980
No!

1652
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,560
That would've been cool though.

1653
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,600
That would've been so cool!

1654
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,080
Wait, can they even go over this?

1655
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,080
I don't think these guys can go over this.

1656
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:44,960
Where did they go?

1657
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,900
Where did they fly to?

1658
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:55,220
Where did they fly to?

1659
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:55,220
Where did they fly to?

1660
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,500
Did they fly like here?

1661
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,660
I guess here?

1662
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,120
Would they be behind us?

1663
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,480
Where did they go?

1664
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,220
That was so confusing.

1665
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,020
Did they went behind us?

1666
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,980
I'd assume they would like go like...

1667
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:26,860
Oh shit.

1668
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:31,240
The fuck?

1669
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,200
Where did all these freaks keep coming from?

1670
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,200
That's fucking right.

1671
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,100
That's fucking right.

1672
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,720
Oh shit, okay.

1673
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,080
I was the better sniper until I had to snipe somebody else.

1674
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,180
Alright.

1675
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:48,980
That's fine.

1676
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,260
Ugh.

1677
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:54,480
There's so many weird ass people.

1678
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,880
What are you doing just crouching?

1679
01:16:58,980 --> 01:16:59,780
Wait, what?

1680
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,860
What are you doing just crouching there?

1681
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,900
He's just crouching!

1682
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,120
Okay, we should hit this.

1683
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,200
I don't like this spot.

1684
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,420
It's a full squad team, people.

1685
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,260
I don't know about standing here, but okay.

1686
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,380
Feel like we should not be in the open.

1687
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:28,500
But, you know.

1688
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:30,740
That's alright.

1689
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,480
I mean, you do you guys.

1690
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,260
We should like head back.

1691
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,300
Yeah, we should head back.

1692
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,480
Let them fight that.

1693
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,300
I'm fine with chilling.

1694
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:46,310
Seems a little dangerous, you know, with no cover.

1695
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:48,130
But what would I know?

1696
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:53,410
I don't need any of those, but I'll take it.

1697
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:56,610
I'll take it so nobody else can take it.

1698
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:02,870
Does any of my team need this?

1699
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:07,790
Look at that!

1700
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:08,570
I'm a team player!

1701
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:13,930
I saw that my teammates needed energy ammo.

1702
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:16,330
Look at that!

1703
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:19,690
I'm a team player!

1704
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,030
Oh, I need that, actually.

1705
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:25,530
Alright.

1706
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:27,170
I did my part, exactly.

1707
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:33,570
I need to remember this is not the tweaking 800 lives game.

1708
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:37,500
Let's see.

1709
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:40,240
I'm over here.

1710
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:41,860
What?

1711
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,360
Over there.

1712
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:43,780
Oh!

1713
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:43,880
Woah!

1714
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:49,730
Oh god.

1715
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:53,050
Oh no.

1716
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:54,030
He tagged me.

1717
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:55,050
Woah.

1718
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:57,050
Woah.

1719
01:18:58,370 --> 01:18:59,210
I'm safe.

1720
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:01,410
I feel safe in my safe zone.

1721
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,310
I don't have shield cells, though.

1722
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:06,910
Alright.

1723
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:10,370
He downed somebody behind us.

1724
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:12,790
But like, I don't know if he thirsted.

1725
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:13,790
He didn't thirst him.

1726
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:14,430
Though I know.

1727
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,630
Oh shit!

1728
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,090
You know what?

1729
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:24,090
Fuck you in particular.

1730
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:29,370
Yeah.

1731
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,990
Fuck you in particular.

1732
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:38,010
What?

1733
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,250
He has a... Oh, it was a sniper mark.

1734
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:42,650
It was a sniper mark.

1735
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:43,410
I was like...

1736
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:44,610
What?

1737
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:44,810
What?

1738
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,450
That was like super cocky.

1739
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:53,570
I'm safe.

1740
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:54,210
I'm safe.

1741
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,310
If you don't look at him, they can't see you.

1742
01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:00,190
If you don't look at them, they can't see you.

1743
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:02,670
If you don't look at them, they can't see you.

1744
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:05,670
That's all.

1745
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:07,090
That's all that matters!

1746
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,810
You don't see you don't die.

1747
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,070
Them's the rules.

1748
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,040
There's a heat shield, but like...

1749
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,160
God damn it!

1750
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,200
That's a full squad!

1751
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:28,880
Come back here!

1752
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,320
Or not.

1753
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,060
Or don't.

1754
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,380
Well, alright, okay.

1755
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:36,500
Oh!

1756
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:38,700
Okay.

1757
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,340
I feel safe here.

1758
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,400
I do not feel safe here anymore.

1759
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:46,980
Alright.

1760
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:47,800
Alright.

1761
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,380
Alright.

1762
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,920
Guys!

1763
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:51,480
Oh!

1764
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,260
Okay!

1765
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,540
That's...

1766
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:57,100
Wow!

1767
01:20:58,940 --> 01:20:59,460
Hey!

1768
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,560
Let's just...

1769
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,460
Fuck everybody!

1770
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:02,420
Let's party!

1771
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:08,120
Let's fucking party in that room!

1772
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:10,940
God damn!

1773
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,540
Oh my God!

1774
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,760
What the fuck did I... What was that?

1775
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:17,100
I...

1776
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,880
I got fucking...

1777
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,140
Ran so hard down there!

1778
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:24,040
Like...

1779
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,200
I got shot by three...

1780
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:29,440
It's a monster house.

1781
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,460
Like...

1782
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:30,980
Alright!

1783
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:32,780
Who cares?

1784
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,760
I know, like, real estate is, like, an issue.

1785
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,240
Oh, that guy is actually blind.

1786
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:46,880
Guys, I know, like, um, real estate is really hard to find good places.

1787
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,700
to live these days.

1788
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,080
Like, I know.

1789
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,080
But, like, one at a time!

1790
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:58,960
If you want a viewing, one at a time, guys!

1791
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:02,320
This is not an open house!

1792
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,840
It's not an open house, everybody!

1793
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:09,580
It certainly wasn't a party in the USA.

1794
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,960
Holy fuck!

1795
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:14,580
That was actually fucking crazy.

1796
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,080
Like, what the fuck did I went through?

1797
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,620
Alright, Octane, you better live for us.

1798
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,080
Crouch!

1799
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:23,560
Octane!

1800
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,580
He doesn't know how to crouch?

1801
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:27,580
Okay.

1802
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:32,420
This guy isn't... This guy might be Diamond, but he's not, like...

1803
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,520
He doesn't look at game knowledge.

1804
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,400
Like, I don't know.

1805
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,300
Did they change it?

1806
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,760
If you crouch in a serial, they can't see you.

1807
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,540
They can't see you if you crouch in a serial.

1808
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:47,880
So, like, I don't know if they changed it, but, like, that usually...

1809
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,440
Octane players don't crouch.

1810
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,020
Oh, what the fuck?

1811
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:56,620
That's a spot?

1812
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,640
Is this a ratting diamond?

1813
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,160
That's a spot?

1814
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,020
What the fuck?

1815
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,320
Okay, he knows the spots.

1816
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:05,960
What a chat.

1817
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,300
No crouching.

1818
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,340
Way to be aggressive.

1819
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,700
I fucking love you.

1820
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:13,840
I don't know if that's sarcasm or, like, not.

1821
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,680
I don't.

1822
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:19,500
I can't tell it's Apex.

1823
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,520
I can't tell.

1824
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:23,060
Because he definitely ran away from us.

1825
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,720
He knows that I don't know.

1826
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,320
And then he covers his tracks.

1827
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:30,660
Yeah.

1828
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:35,500
I can't tell because Apex people are always sarcastic.

1829
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:38,860
So I can't tell if he's being sarcastic or not.

1830
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:39,860
I...

1831
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,060
Okay.

1832
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,460
There's still five squads?

1833
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:46,400
How?

1834
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,760
He's so dead.

1835
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,340
Like, what is he...

1836
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:50,360
What is he trying to do?

1837
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,560
What is he...

1838
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,260
Okay.

1839
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,460
After all that...

1840
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:57,300
After all that...

1841
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:58,600
I'm just like...

1842
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,280
What was he...

1843
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,360
What was that?

1844
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,080
Legend.

1845
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:11,620
He panicked.

1846
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:12,280
He really did.

1847
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,000
You know what?

1848
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,140
Oh, no, no, no.

1849
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:14,960
Absolutely not.

1850
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,580
No, no, no, no.

1851
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:19,940
Yay!

1852
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,020
All right.

1853
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:24,940
All right.

1854
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,380
Before...

1855
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,260
We're not ending yet.

1856
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:29,240
We have one last ultimate stress test to do, guys.

1857
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,720
We have one last stress test to do, chat.

1858
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,340
To make sure everything is okay.

1859
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,420
Guys, just one last stress test.

1860
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,280
Swap.

1861
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:40,860
Let me swap real fast.

1862
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:41,260
Oh, yeah.

1863
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,420
You guys can be big again.

1864
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,440
Guys, I fixed it.

1865
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,460
Apparently, it was an OBS issue, but you guys can be big now.

1866
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:49,500
Congratulations.

1867
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:53,580
You guys...

1868
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:58,240
You guys can be big boys again.

1869
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,300
But the ultimate...

1870
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,720
The ultimate stress test...

1871
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:05,900
What?

1872
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,060
What?

1873
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,560
Wait a minute.

1874
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:16,480
What?

1875
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:24,430
Wait.

1876
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:26,330
Wait a minute.

1877
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,330
Wait a minute.

1878
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,150
Oh.

1879
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:31,130
Oh, that scared me.

1880
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:38,570
It said... It said my Overwatch uninstalled.

1881
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:40,270
And I was like, what?

1882
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:43,970
I was like, how did it...

1883
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:46,990
Anyway, the ultimate stress test.

1884
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:51,130
I was like, there's no way it uninstalled.

1885
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:53,230
I've been playing Overwatch every day.

1886
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:58,150
I was like, I'm fixing my PC.

1887
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:59,790
I got it uninstalled.

1888
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,190
How is that possible?

1889
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:04,390
Anyway, that's the ultimate stress test.

1890
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:04,890
Let's go.

1891
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:08,610
Let's go.

1892
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:10,190
We're only doing one game.

1893
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:11,910
We're only doing one game, though.

1894
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:14,210
Okay.

1895
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:17,870
Alright, let me make sure what sound I have to do for Overwatch.

1896
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:18,710
Overwatch.

1897
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,450
12.0.

1898
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:23,150
Okay.

1899
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,070
Here.

1900
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:29,070
Alright.

1901
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:34,110
I need to make sure where my sound balancing was for Overwatch.

1902
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,750
Apparently, it is 12.0.

1903
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:38,570
I think.

1904
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,310
Unless it's not.

1905
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:41,870
Let me make sure.

1906
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:42,890
Overwatch.

1907
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:45,430
Yeah, that should be it.

1908
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:46,270
Alright, guys.

1909
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:48,590
Then we know it's okay.

1910
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,210
Then we know.

1911
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:51,510
If we lose, we lose.

1912
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:53,990
Because I can gain it back later.

1913
01:26:56,810 --> 01:27:00,330
I'm just like two games away from, you know.

1914
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:02,870
Wait.

1915
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:06,190
Oh, God.

1916
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:06,590
Please.

1917
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:07,610
Please.

1918
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:09,230
Please, no!

1919
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:19,500
I saw my tap.

1920
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,580
There's nothing I can do!

1921
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,240
There's really nothing I can do!

1922
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:29,420
She just slowly titled the way over!

1923
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,680
What can I do about it?

1924
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:32,060
Nothing!

1925
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:34,500
That's the worst part!

1926
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,800
I need this kill.

1927
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,980
This might not be it.

1928
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,920
I need this kill.

1929
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,040
Why is there a Junker and Hammond?

1930
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:48,880
Oh, and a Sigma?

1931
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:49,820
I heard a Sigma.

1932
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,080
I heard him.

1933
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,060
Please!

1934
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:54,480
Please!

1935
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:55,700
Oh, hey.

1936
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:00,220
I be friends with him so he doesn't kill me.

1937
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:05,160
Oh, my God.

1938
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:08,080
Alright, here we go.

1939
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:10,840
One last game.

1940
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,580
One last game.

1941
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,920
The ultimate stress test.

1942
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,600
Yay, I stole the kill.

1943
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,140
That's all that matters.

1944
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:26,560
No!

1945
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,860
I can't shoot like this!

1946
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,240
I can't shoot.

1947
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:31,800
Alright.

1948
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,580
That's fucking right.

1949
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,200
That's right.

1950
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,180
You can't do nothing.

1951
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,060
Can't do nothing.

1952
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,460
I can't do nothing either.

1953
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:42,800
Alright.

1954
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,300
Oh, my God.

1955
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:48,460
Yes, it's rough.

1956
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,740
What the fuck are you doing?

1957
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,280
It's just me and you, Chuno.

1958
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:56,180
Yay!

1959
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:58,320
Now I'm killed either.

1960
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:00,580
Oh, my God.

1961
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,080
There's three stack that joined in.

1962
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,100
I hear him.

1963
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,220
I hear him.

1964
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:07,480
Where is he?

1965
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:09,100
I hear you.

1966
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,240
Is he above me?

1967
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,780
He's above me right now, isn't he?

1968
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:13,460
Oh, there's the echo.

1969
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:14,360
Oh, thank God.

1970
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,480
All the tank players left.

1971
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:17,500
No.

1972
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,500
Oh, God.

1973
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:18,840
Guys.

1974
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,820
I played too much Apex.

1975
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,140
And by too much, I meant I played Apex just then.

1976
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:26,860
My aim.

1977
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,860
My aim can't do it.

1978
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,380
My aim's not used to Overwatch sense anymore.

1979
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:35,360
Alright.

1980
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,840
I'm trying to...

1981
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,240
Oh, God.

1982
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,100
There's a... No!

1983
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:41,240
Leave me alone.

1984
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:42,120
Leave me alone.

1985
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,480
Leave me alone.

1986
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:45,500
I hate Venture so much.

1987
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:46,960
Alright.

1988
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:47,340
That's good.

1989
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:48,920
Alright.

1990
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:49,940
The Venture left.

1991
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,060
Oh, no.

1992
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,360
It's just me and the Venture.

1993
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,040
How am I not in the game?

1994
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,980
I don't understand.

1995
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,060
Hello?

1996
01:29:59,120 --> 01:29:59,660
Friendly?

1997
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:02,840
I'm desperate.

1998
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,920
I'm desperate right now.

1999
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:15,040
I joined Deathmatch not to have a skirmish.

2000
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,600
Venture, if you want to say hi, join a skirmish.

2001
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,800
This is literally Deathmatch.

2002
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:22,920
Okay.

2003
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:24,620
Ooh.

2004
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:25,460
Ooh, Pharah.

2005
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,680
Wait, that's good aim practice.

2006
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,700
Oh, shit!

2007
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:32,920
That wasn't a Pharah.

2008
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:34,460
Please!

2009
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,620
Why you open me?

2010
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,640
The fuck is...

2011
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,780
Three people.

2012
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,660
Why did all three people showed up?

2013
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,500
That's so fucked up.

2014
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:51,140
Not gonna lie.

2015
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,560
Holy shit.

2016
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,840
That's actually fucked up.

2017
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:58,800
No!

2018
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,180
That Rein was so low!

2019
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,160
What is that?

2020
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,900
Oh, that's Pharah.

2021
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:08,600
I was gonna say, why did it take so long to...

2022
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,160
Oh my god, please.

2023
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:13,420
Somebody show up.

2024
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:15,540
I just wanna get in the game.

2025
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:16,040
Please!

2026
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,400
Give me a game!

2027
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:22,900
No!

2028
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:26,020
No!

2029
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,020
God damn it.

2030
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:28,120
Oh.

2031
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:30,420
I'm leaving.

2032
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,600
He actually died for that deflect.

2033
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:34,860
What a fucking idiot.

2034
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,320
That guy actually died for...

2035
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,820
You can tell how long I've been here.

2036
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,860
Everybody else has...

2037
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:44,980
Everybody else has found the game and I'm still here.

2038
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:46,400
This is so sad.

2039
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:49,600
Like, how am I still here?

2040
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,680
There's nobody...

2041
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,160
There's nobody...

2042
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,580
There's nobody else that's been here as long as I have.

2043
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,420
There's nobody else that's been here as long as I have.

2044
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:07,200
Please.

2045
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,180
Oh thank god.

2046
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,260
Thank god.

2047
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,280
Free me.

2048
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,660
Chris and Teyv match forever.

2049
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:17,460
GM5!

2050
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:18,420
GM5!

2051
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:21,460
It's 9pm!

2052
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,680
I didn't wanna try that hard!

2053
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:29,860
Oh.

2054
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,120
What do people play?

2055
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:32,840
I don't know.

2056
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:33,280
Meta?

2057
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,240
Who GM?

2058
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,680
I didn't wanna fucking play...

2059
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:40,900
I

2060
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:46,380
didn't wanna fucking play...

2061
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:47,480
Oh my god.

2062
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,160
I fucking...

2063
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:55,340
I played Overwatch like on and off this past week.

2064
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:55,660
I played Overwatch like on and off this past week.

2065
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:56,200
And there was...

2066
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,180
I didn't get into a single GM5.

2067
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,240
I didn't get into a single GM game.

2068
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:01,180
They were all like...

2069
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,500
The highest was like Master 1.

2070
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:03,920
And like now...

2071
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,100
Oh!

2072
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:04,920
The one game!

2073
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,080
The one game I wanted to play on stream with you guys!

2074
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,860
To stress test my PC!

2075
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,080
And it's GM5!

2076
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,220
I didn't...

2077
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:18,060
I wasn't expecting...

2078
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:18,980
I wanted to stress test!

2079
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,300
I'm trying to stress test my PC!

2080
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:26,840
Not...

2081
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,020
Not...

2082
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,700
Not my fucking...

2083
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:31,520
My stuff!

2084
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,500
Jesus Christ.

2085
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,360
I'm not okay everybody.

2086
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,600
I am not okay right now.

2087
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,040
Play.

2088
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:42,760
I'm not okay.

2089
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,800
Oh shit.

2090
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:49,180
Oh that was close.

2091
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,940
I saw her at the last second.

2092
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,580
Oh nice now I can peek.

2093
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:57,660
Oh what the fuck?

2094
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,500
I'm stressed already.

2095
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:02,080
I'm stressed already.

2096
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,480
I actually need to try!

2097
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,400
But what if I don't want to try?

2098
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,040
But what if I don't want to try?

2099
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,780
But what if I don't want to try?

2100
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,640
What the fuck is...

2101
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:15,780
Wow!

2102
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,340
Alright.

2103
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:23,800
Alright.

2104
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:25,600
Okay.

2105
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:29,920
Okay.

2106
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:31,060
Okay.

2107
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:33,300
Okay.

2108
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:36,380
Can you shoot him?

2109
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,200
No!

2110
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:38,440
He was so low!

2111
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,320
We almost got him.

2112
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:43,620
For those who don't know.

2113
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,480
GM5 is currently...

2114
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,560
It's currently top 200.

2115
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:49,920
So like...

2116
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:50,980
That's why I'm like...

2117
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:53,480
I did not want to do a GM...

2118
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,460
GM game right now.

2119
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:57,320
It's literally top 200.

2120
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,640
If you're GM5.

2121
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,260
Like why?

2122
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:02,640
Like why?

2123
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:08,900
Alright.

2124
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:09,540
Here we go.

2125
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:18,600
Yeah GM5 is top 200 at the moment.

2126
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,760
You're really close to top 500.

2127
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,340
I'm like two ranks.

2128
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:25,140
Two tiers.

2129
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,020
From top 500 right now.

2130
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,380
Oh shit.

2131
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:33,520
Oh.

2132
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:35,800
Oh my god.

2133
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:37,140
Yippee!

2134
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,800
My team is carrying me!

2135
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,140
Let's go!

2136
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:44,120
Let's fucking go!

2137
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:45,700
Woo!

2138
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,840
That was scary though.

2139
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:48,360
Not gonna lie.

2140
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,280
Yeah!

2141
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,360
I can chill!

2142
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:57,920
A little bit.

2143
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,940
Until I can't.

2144
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,160
Okay.

2145
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,040
Oh!

2146
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,700
This is where I die!

2147
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:07,000
Nope.

2148
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,060
I made it.

2149
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:10,860
I made it.

2150
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:12,620
I made it.

2151
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,860
I think our Tracer is the top GM5.

2152
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,460
The Tracer is like killing everybody right now.

2153
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:19,660
Which is great.

2154
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,000
I love it when like...

2155
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,980
Oh shit!

2156
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,140
Fucking whoa!

2157
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,320
Oh.

2158
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,400
The...

2159
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,400
I mean...

2160
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:30,740
You live.

2161
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,740
This Lucio is fucking around.

2162
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:36,780
Holy fuck!

2163
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:38,380
This poor Lucio.

2164
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,220
This team has a...

2165
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:43,460
This team has a troll Lucio.

2166
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,380
That's for sure.

2167
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:48,320
Oh my god.

2168
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:50,580
Oh nice.

2169
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,020
Whoa!

2170
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,540
I'm gonna stay here.

2171
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:55,660
Alright.

2172
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:56,280
I'm gonna stay here.

2173
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:58,640
I don't feel safe.

2174
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,020
I don't...

2175
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,480
I'm gonna stay here guys.

2176
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,060
I'm gonna stay here.

2177
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:07,320
I'm gonna stay right here.

2178
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,720
Yay!

2179
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,200
My mouse died!

2180
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:12,480
When that happened!

2181
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,200
Okay no it's just slow mode.

2182
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:14,860
Okay thank god.

2183
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:24,380
I'm so happy I have the GM5 on my team.

2184
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,100
I'm so happy.

2185
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:27,480
And he's not a support.

2186
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:32,460
I'm so happy.

2187
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:34,240
Holy shit.

2188
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:36,380
Who the fuck was that Lucio?

2189
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:37,500
Like...

2190
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,120
Actually...

2191
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,180
Okay it's either ink or...

2192
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,240
Cause like one of them is actually throwing.

2193
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:47,140
One of them is fucking not playing the game.

2194
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:47,780
One of them is fucking not playing the game.

2195
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:51,580
And he's definitely not playing the game.

2196
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:52,860
And he's definitely not playing the game.

2197
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:53,420
Is it Lilac?

2198
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,100
No.

2199
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:58,260
He's the master 5.

2200
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,040
He's the master 5?

2201
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:02,160
Who the fuck is our GM5?

2202
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:05,200
There's no way the GM...

2203
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:05,900
I do not...

2204
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:09,000
There's no way the GM5 is...

2205
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:09,560
Um...

2206
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:11,820
I don't believe...

2207
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:15,960
The GM5 is on the enemy team with how they're doing right now.

2208
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:16,540
Also...

2209
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:18,360
Zero thank you for the super chat.

2210
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:18,660
Thank you.

2211
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,040
It was I the Lucio.

2212
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,640
Who the fuck is throwing?

2213
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,440
Who the fuck is throwing?

2214
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:28,020
Alright.

2215
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:31,760
Cause this does not feel like a high elo game.

2216
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:35,660
Alright.

2217
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,000
Is there a Widow?

2218
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:39,720
Widows are winning the duels.

2219
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:42,320
Everybody's incognito mode.

2220
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:43,280
Including me.

2221
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,880
I can hear the Lucio.

2222
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:50,880
They have the Widow so I don't wanna peek.

2223
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,500
I'm scared of peeking.

2224
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:55,640
I'm gonna peek only when the...

2225
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:56,460
Uh...

2226
01:38:58,420 --> 01:38:59,100
Wow!

2227
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,000
He died to a Lucio!

2228
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:00,440
Wow!

2229
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:09,490
Oh my god.

2230
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:10,270
He's so low.

2231
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:12,050
Wait, maybe this Lucio is...

2232
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:13,950
What the fuck?

2233
01:39:14,410 --> 01:39:16,650
What the fuck is he doing?

2234
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:24,110
Guys, I'm too tired to be doing this Ana Lucio.

2235
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:26,890
From what?

2236
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,610
From BBC?

2237
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:30,490
What the fuck?

2238
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:32,870
Guess I'm too tired to be...

2239
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:34,830
Handling that Lucio right now.

2240
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:35,630
Like...

2241
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:39,830
Like really?

2242
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:42,530
I'm gonna Kiriko here.

2243
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:45,230
Cause like...

2244
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:48,770
Oh no, I can't...

2245
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:49,490
Kill...

2246
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:52,050
Oh no.

2247
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:53,690
I'm fucking...

2248
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:56,510
I'm mis-positioning myself for you Winston!

2249
01:39:57,070 --> 01:39:58,730
I'm... Alright, I'm going Kiriko.

2250
01:39:58,730 --> 01:39:59,970
This team...

2251
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:01,210
This team's a mess.

2252
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:03,010
This team...

2253
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:04,670
I can't position!

2254
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,690
I can't position at all!

2255
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:09,610
Everybody's everywhere!

2256
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:15,110
Don't you hate it when everybody is just everywhere?

2257
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:16,970
Don't you hate it when everybody is just everywhere?

2258
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:18,850
Alright, I saved the...

2259
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:19,330
Uh...

2260
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:22,330
Guys, I'm... I'm here.

2261
01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:24,930
But I don't know how long...

2262
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:26,830
I don't know how long...

2263
01:40:26,830 --> 01:40:27,930
I can be here though.

2264
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:29,970
I'm gone.

2265
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:31,250
I'm gone.

2266
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:33,950
Maybe Ink is GM5.

2267
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:35,990
He literally got 3k.

2268
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:40,550
He literally 1v1'd the Widow.

2269
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:42,470
Oh my god.

2270
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:46,670
Oh my god, maybe he is.

2271
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:50,290
Holy shit.

2272
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:52,410
We're a mess because of this Lucio now.

2273
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:55,090
Holy fuck.

2274
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:55,490
Oh.

2275
01:40:56,830 --> 01:40:57,410
He went back to me.

2276
01:40:57,570 --> 01:40:58,930
I honestly thought that...

2277
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:01,210
I'm not timing stuff correctly right now.

2278
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:01,950
Which is bad.

2279
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:05,110
Because I need to time my stuff better.

2280
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:06,970
Oh no.

2281
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:08,990
I don't know why we went rigged.

2282
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:11,210
Like, none of our...

2283
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:14,210
None of what they're playing is...

2284
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:15,310
Oh my god, we did it!

2285
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,570
Raid boss is down!

2286
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:19,050
Raid boss is down!

2287
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:19,870
I repeat!

2288
01:41:22,430 --> 01:41:24,070
The raid boss has...

2289
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:25,670
Where is the Winston?

2290
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:28,750
Oh my god, there he is!

2291
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:31,290
I was like trying to find him.

2292
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:35,710
Oh no.

2293
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:37,210
Whoops.

2294
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:39,790
Oh, I hear the Lucio.

2295
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:41,310
I hear him.

2296
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:43,290
Nice.

2297
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:46,690
I need to save the Brig though.

2298
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:49,130
Oh my god.

2299
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:50,910
No, he's not throwing.

2300
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:53,010
He's playing very aggro.

2301
01:41:54,110 --> 01:41:54,990
And...

2302
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:55,590
He's dead.

2303
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:03,490
Jesus Christ.

2304
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:05,510
Okay, we're fine.

2305
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:06,630
For now.

2306
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:09,710
We're fine for now.

2307
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:11,390
We're fine.

2308
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:12,490
Okay.

2309
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:14,030
Alright.

2310
01:42:15,410 --> 01:42:16,670
Hey guys.

2311
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:18,730
Hey.

2312
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:22,470
Oh, goodbye everybody.

2313
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:32,690
Please.

2314
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:37,090
Please, why are we playing Brig?

2315
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:38,090
Get off Brig.

2316
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:40,810
We don't need Brig right now.

2317
01:42:41,230 --> 01:42:41,870
Everybody...

2318
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:44,110
We don't have dive characters.

2319
01:42:44,850 --> 01:42:45,490
Brig.

2320
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:46,530
Ma'am.

2321
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:48,110
We don't have dive characters.

2322
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:50,030
Nobody's playing dive.

2323
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:51,250
Why?

2324
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:53,470
Why are we on Brig?

2325
01:42:54,150 --> 01:42:56,250
Nobody is diving anybody.

2326
01:42:56,570 --> 01:42:57,870
They're all there.

2327
01:42:59,260 --> 01:42:59,550
They're...

2328
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:01,770
I don't understand.

2329
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:04,110
How are you dying to win?

2330
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:09,470
I really, really wish he was not playing Brig.

2331
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:12,670
No, it's cause like, the comp does not need a Brig right now.

2332
01:43:13,070 --> 01:43:13,850
That's why.

2333
01:43:14,050 --> 01:43:17,010
That's why like, there's no reason to play Brig.

2334
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:20,350
Because like, we're not brawling on point.

2335
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:23,210
Maybe both teams are just equally bad.

2336
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:28,730
Both teams are just not good.

2337
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:31,390
Not good at defense.

2338
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:33,290
Honestly?

2339
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:34,010
Yeah.

2340
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:35,770
I think...

2341
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:38,570
I don't...

2342
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:40,430
I think we're both not good at defense.

2343
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:41,630
Now that I've seen it.

2344
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:43,370
He definitely has.

2345
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:46,590
Alright.

2346
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:48,970
God damn it!

2347
01:43:50,030 --> 01:43:51,470
God damn it!

2348
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:52,910
Really?

2349
01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:54,730
Alright.

2350
01:43:55,150 --> 01:43:56,530
Nice, we got the Soldier.

2351
01:43:58,070 --> 01:43:59,270
They have...

2352
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:01,790
He has Sigma ult.

2353
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:03,270
There it is.

2354
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:05,290
Oh, there they go.

2355
01:44:05,550 --> 01:44:06,770
They are both dead.

2356
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:07,810
There's no saving that.

2357
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:08,850
There's no...

2358
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:11,310
We're both just really bad at defense.

2359
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:12,930
Like, that's good to know.

2360
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:14,610
That's good to know.

2361
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:16,690
That is very good to know!

2362
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:20,900
I blame the Brig pick.

2363
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:21,940
100%.

2364
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:23,840
Okay,

2365
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:31,680
I wanna like, make sure that our Hog is alive.

2366
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:34,740
Okay.

2367
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:35,820
There you go.

2368
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:36,940
Alright.

2369
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:38,620
Please.

2370
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:46,100
All I ask is that you all fucking get one pick.

2371
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:46,740
One pick!

2372
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:48,140
Oh, thank god!

2373
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:49,260
Two picks!

2374
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,600
Two picks!

2375
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:53,100
Let's go!

2376
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:54,640
Two picks!

2377
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,240
Oh, he's living on the edge right now!

2378
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,360
And I'm gonna stand here because I feel like that Lucio's gonna backcap.

2379
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,260
I think that Lucio's gonna backcap.

2380
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,320
So I'm gonna stay right here.

2381
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:07,740
I'm gonna stay right here.

2382
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,320
Alright.

2383
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:11,500
This is fine.

2384
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:12,580
It's not fine.

2385
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,340
But like, I gotta be optimistic for a little bit.

2386
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,100
So like, this is as fine as it can get.

2387
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:21,460
This is as fine as it can be right now.

2388
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:23,900
What?

2389
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:24,460
That hit?

2390
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:25,620
That didn't hit him?

2391
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:26,980
That sucks.

2392
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:29,260
That fucking sucks.

2393
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:31,420
Okay, now the Brig is good.

2394
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:34,480
Now this is the perfect time to stay Brig.

2395
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:38,200
Because Brig is very good against D.Va.

2396
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,740
Because D.Va is a Dive character.

2397
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,120
And he can knock off.

2398
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:47,380
Okay, now I can like go back up.

2399
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:48,260
Whoa.

2400
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:51,720
Okay, that's not good.

2401
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,200
Oh.

2402
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:57,780
Oh, okay!

2403
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:00,420
I literally went to...

2404
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:02,200
Okay, my buddy.

2405
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,120
My buddy.

2406
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,900
We are dead.

2407
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,140
Alright.

2408
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:10,140
Can anybody touch?

2409
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:11,740
Can you guys touch?

2410
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:12,740
Okay.

2411
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:16,600
Okay.

2412
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:17,480
Okay.

2413
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,660
The dragon is becoming!

2414
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:19,420
Oh!

2415
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:20,940
Genji, no!

2416
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:22,460
Alright.

2417
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:25,700
Wait, Temmin is still alive!

2418
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:27,180
Oh, okay!

2419
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:28,800
Alive is a good word.

2420
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,680
A good statement.

2421
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:30,380
Okay.

2422
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:31,920
I'm not kidding.

2423
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:37,240
Oh my god.

2424
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,880
This is rough.

2425
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:42,420
We are both really bad at defense.

2426
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
We're both really bad at defense.

2427
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:49,300
Go Astrid, go.

2428
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:53,000
Okay, you know, I feel a lot better with that pick.

2429
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:54,220
I feel...

2430
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,240
I feel a little bit better with that pick, you know?

2431
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:04,820
Alright,

2432
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:09,020
here we go.

2433
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:10,720
This is one game!

2434
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,780
I'm still in that one game!

2435
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:14,320
I'm still...

2436
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:18,140
I'm still in this one game!

2437
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:21,640
Oh, I had to jinx it when I was like, Yay!

2438
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:25,960
I'm so happy that, like, I'm getting carried right now!

2439
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,120
Yippee!

2440
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,880
In the GM5 lobby!

2441
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:30,380
Let's go!

2442
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:32,620
And I had to jinx it.

2443
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:34,460
I had to jinx it.

2444
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,020
I had to make this harder for myself.

2445
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:36,960
I really did.

2446
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:39,460
Yippee.

2447
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:40,620
I am...

2448
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,000
not focused at all, too.

2449
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,680
Like, that's the worst part.

2450
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:46,300
Like, I am definitely not focused right now.

2451
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:52,120
This is a stress test in a whole nother level.

2452
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:56,400
Zero, thank you for the five!

2453
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:57,120
Get the ships!

2454
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:57,900
Thank you, thank you!

2455
01:47:57,900 --> 01:47:59,080
Okay, I don't wanna get sniped accidentally.

2456
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:01,560
Okay.

2457
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:04,140
Okay.

2458
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:05,800
They have Widow?

2459
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,400
They have... why?

2460
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,680
That's interesting.

2461
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:14,640
Oh!

2462
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:16,440
Nice!

2463
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:17,720
We got rid of...

2464
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:18,660
No Widow!

2465
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:21,280
Okay, I can play more, like, uh...

2466
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:22,100
Whoa!

2467
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:23,840
Okay.

2468
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:26,600
This Hanzo's good, so I'm like...

2469
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:29,800
What the fuck was that Reaper doing?

2470
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:32,500
Alright.

2471
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:33,880
Gotta make sure...

2472
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,840
I was like, where's that... where is...

2473
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:36,860
Oh, nice!

2474
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:37,280
Okay.

2475
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:42,700
Oh my god, that Lucio's so low!

2476
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:46,900
What?!

2477
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:49,460
That doesn't stop charges anymore!

2478
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:53,510
On charge!

2479
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:55,330
No, I threw!

2480
01:48:56,490 --> 01:48:57,250
No!

2481
01:48:57,930 --> 01:49:00,010
It used to stop charges!

2482
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:02,250
I actually threw that!

2483
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:07,050
That used to stop Ryan's charge, and I didn't realize they changed it!

2484
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:09,610
I actually didn't know!

2485
01:49:09,970 --> 01:49:11,310
Oh my god!

2486
01:49:12,190 --> 01:49:13,690
It used... it actually does!

2487
01:49:13,870 --> 01:49:15,430
I'm not... I'm not fucking with you guys.

2488
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:20,110
It actually used to stop Ryan's charges, so I was, like, not expecting that at all.

2489
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:22,310
No... no...

2490
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:25,050
That's so... that sucks.

2491
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:26,610
That actually sucks.

2492
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:27,690
I'm gonna back up.

2493
01:49:28,110 --> 01:49:29,970
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

2494
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:31,550
I'm actually so sad that happened.

2495
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:33,950
Stop.

2496
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:36,470
It's okay, team.

2497
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:38,530
I don't feel okay.

2498
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:39,690
I don't feel okay.

2499
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:41,570
I do not feel okay.

2500
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,070
How am I not real?

2501
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:43,450
Yo!

2502
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:45,290
Yo, what the fuck, man?

2503
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:46,750
I'm not bashing one trick, man.

2504
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:47,530
Come on, knock it off.

2505
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:50,090
Oh my god, I actually threw!

2506
01:49:50,210 --> 01:49:51,170
I feel so bad!

2507
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:54,450
I feel so bad, because, like...

2508
01:49:57,690 --> 01:50:00,910
Oh my god, if I didn't die, we would've won.

2509
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:02,230
We actually would've won that.

2510
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:07,750
I actually was like, kiki, I'm just gonna...

2511
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:08,790
Oh no.

2512
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:10,050
Oh no.

2513
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:12,550
We need a reset here.

2514
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:15,430
Oh shit.

2515
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:17,370
No!

2516
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:20,030
It's okay, the Zarya died too.

2517
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,470
Oh!

2518
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:25,370
Yo, why are you... yo, you're on Zarya and a Rein, bro.

2519
01:50:32,610 --> 01:50:34,250
Okay, they don't blame me!

2520
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:35,950
They don't blame me, guys!

2521
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:37,490
They don't blame me!

2522
01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:38,490
Guys!

2523
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:38,790
Guys!

2524
01:50:38,990 --> 01:50:40,790
It's great, they don't blame me!

2525
01:50:41,150 --> 01:50:43,270
They didn't blame me for the loss!

2526
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:45,290
Oh my god, I'm so happy!

2527
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:47,570
I didn't get blamed for it!

2528
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:50,510
That's all that matters.

2529
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:54,990
Okay.

2530
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:56,430
Alright.

2531
01:50:58,730 --> 01:51:00,610
They don't know what I did.

2532
01:51:00,970 --> 01:51:02,130
Oh, thank god.

2533
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:03,890
When did they change that?

2534
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,210
When did they change the charge?

2535
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:08,070
Oh, thank god.

2536
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:08,950
They don't blame me.

2537
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:09,650
Not our fault.

2538
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:11,410
They're blaming each other.

2539
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:13,170
That's like my...

2540
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:14,350
That makes me so happy.

2541
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:19,390
In the end, nobody expects that I threw there to cause the momentum.

2542
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:20,910
Nobody expects it.

2543
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:22,710
And that's all that matters, everybody.

2544
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:26,930
As long as they don't think it's my fault.

2545
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:32,550
But now I know!

2546
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:35,030
Now I literally know.

2547
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:37,470
Now...

2548
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:41,070
Now I know!

2549
01:51:41,490 --> 01:51:42,090
Now I know!

2550
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:43,050
For future's sake!

2551
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:45,650
We know what you did!

2552
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:47,070
Shhh!

2553
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:48,430
It doesn't matter, bro.

2554
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:49,110
It was a free win, bro.

2555
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:50,230
Put it down.

2556
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:51,430
Shhh!

2557
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:55,030
They don't know it was me!

2558
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:57,390
When I thought it...

2559
01:51:58,330 --> 01:52:01,030
But actually, when did they change that?

2560
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:02,670
Did they change that?

2561
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:04,170
Like, what season was it?

2562
01:52:04,290 --> 01:52:07,210
How behind was I in Kiriko Tech?

2563
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:08,550
That they...

2564
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:12,070
They made it so that Suzu doesn't stop charges anymore.

2565
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:14,430
No one tell anybody!

2566
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:15,650
Okay?

2567
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:21,870
I literally was like, he...

2568
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:24,730
I can just Suzu myself and he can't charge me.

2569
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:28,410
Was it actually last season?

2570
01:52:29,010 --> 01:52:30,010
Oh my god.

2571
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:30,730
This...

2572
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:32,690
Was it actually this season?

2573
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:34,150
I am...

2574
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:37,370
I can't believe it!

2575
01:52:37,370 --> 01:52:39,250
I can't believe it!

2576
01:52:39,330 --> 01:52:42,150
It was like two months ago when I didn't play this game!

2577
01:52:42,410 --> 01:52:43,190
As frequently!

2578
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:50,970
Why does, like, all the tech I know, they just... they just change it?

2579
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:52,230
That is actually so unlucky.

2580
01:52:53,050 --> 01:52:54,710
That's two months ago.

2581
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:57,950
They changed it two months ago and I wasn't playing that game two months ago.

2582
01:52:59,490 --> 01:53:02,890
Guys, I don't think we're gonna win this.

2583
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:03,390
Guys.

2584
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:04,370
Guys.

2585
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:05,650
I...

2586
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:08,430
I have a feeling...

2587
01:53:08,430 --> 01:53:09,470
That...

2588
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,090
Um...

2589
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:13,150
We're not gonna win this.

2590
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:14,990
I have...

2591
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:15,930
I...

2592
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:17,670
Ooh...

2593
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:18,690
Ooh...

2594
01:53:18,690 --> 01:53:18,870
I...

2595
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:19,410
Sorry, Zanebotter.

2596
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:23,530
Sorry, Zanebotter.

2597
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:33,740
I got the Lucio.

2598
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:35,940
Oh, shit.

2599
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:37,240
I wanna heal...

2600
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:38,060
Okay.

2601
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:42,160
Oh, there is a Widow again.

2602
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:43,620
And I don't...

2603
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:44,440
I'm gonna push the cart.

2604
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,080
We need as much time as possible.

2605
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:47,660
Like, I...

2606
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:51,900
I don't know if we're actually gonna win this, but, like, you know, I don't want them to think it's my fault.

2607
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,280
They don't know.

2608
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,360
They don't know.

2609
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,360
That's okay.

2610
01:53:58,440 --> 01:53:59,600
They don't know.

2611
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:04,820
Nobody blames me.

2612
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:12,140
I'm so happy.

2613
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:15,760
In the end.

2614
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:17,600
Knowing that...

2615
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:21,000
Knowing that no one actually saw what happened...

2616
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,100
Will help me.

2617
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,480
It's what gives me life.

2618
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:32,520
Oh, they're running full, like, alt counters, though.

2619
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:35,220
They're making it so that...

2620
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:36,420
So that...

2621
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:37,320
Oh, they're like...

2622
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:37,520
Whoa.

2623
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:38,080
Hello.

2624
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:40,240
You guys didn't see anything.

2625
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:41,520
Guys.

2626
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:42,360
Shhh.

2627
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:43,800
Shhh.

2628
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:51,100
They think it's the Hog and the Blados' fault, guys.

2629
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,060
Not me.

2630
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:54,040
Not me.

2631
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,320
Not me, though.

2632
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:00,880
I need to push the cart with our guy.

2633
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:02,340
Um...

2634
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:03,680
This is so hard, guys.

2635
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:06,480
We need to keep up the momentum right now.

2636
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,040
Jesus Christ.

2637
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,480
Like, I'm trying so hard.

2638
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,920
Like, Weaver and I are trying so hard.

2639
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:20,060
It's like, I know what you did last summer.

2640
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:21,480
Or, like, pretty...

2641
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:25,360
Or, either pretty-lyring this, or, like, I know what you did last summer.

2642
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:33,920
Oh.

2643
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:34,980
That was a dink.

2644
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:36,120
Right there.

2645
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:40,840
Woo.

2646
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:42,320
Nice.

2647
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:45,440
Tracer, please tell me you have recall, Tracer.

2648
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:46,780
She did not have...

2649
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:48,220
She didn't have recall.

2650
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:49,020
Oh, no.

2651
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:49,600
Our momentum.

2652
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:50,180
Our momentum.

2653
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:51,240
They

2654
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:00,380
knew.

2655
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:01,360
They knew.

2656
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:05,760
I should have died instantly.

2657
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:06,640
Our momentum.

2658
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:10,700
Oh, my God.

2659
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:14,740
Oh, our momentum.

2660
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,160
Oh, my God.

2661
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,860
I'm just gonna stay back here.

2662
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:22,200
I don't... I don't feel safe up here.

2663
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,180
I'm just gonna go stay here.

2664
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:25,360
Hey guys!

2665
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:31,240
I feel like we should maybe not take 200,000 damage right now.

2666
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:32,120
You know?

2667
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,000
Alright.

2668
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:35,100
Alright!

2669
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:37,720
That is a lot of ults.

2670
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:38,760
That's alright.

2671
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:44,500
It's not, but like... you know... like I don't know what else to do.

2672
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:49,020
Alright.

2673
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:50,560
Momentum!

2674
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,960
We have two... we literally have two fights.

2675
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:53,920
Kill his D.Va.

2676
01:56:56,740 --> 01:56:57,880
Just in case.

2677
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,220
Just in case.

2678
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:00,420
I'm gonna push cart.

2679
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:01,160
I'm gonna push cart.

2680
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,880
You save the life viewer.

2681
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:03,620
You save her.

2682
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:04,960
That is literally your only mission.

2683
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:06,260
They have Pharah ult.

2684
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,160
They have Junk ult.

2685
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:08,460
They have everything.

2686
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:11,340
We gotta kill at least... make them use something.

2687
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:15,600
Oh yes!

2688
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:16,880
I have C9.

2689
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:17,620
I have C9.

2690
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:17,860
I have C9.

2691
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,480
I told you it was an easy win, bro.

2692
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:19,800
You know?

2693
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:21,000
I had that in the bag.

2694
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:25,340
Never punished!

2695
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,740
Oh my god!

2696
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:31,220
Never fucking punished!

2697
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:34,560
Let's fucking go!

2698
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:36,400
They'll never know!

2699
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,180
They'll actually never know!

2700
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:45,500
So I can go.

2701
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:47,520
I might have thrown.

2702
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:47,860
I might have thrown.

2703
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:49,180
But they threw harder.

2704
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:54,340
They threw a lot harder than me.

2705
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,520
Yippee!

2706
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:58,060
Alright.

2707
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:00,960
And I think that's where we're gonna call the stress test.

2708
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:03,680
Thank you for coming to the stress test today.

2709
01:58:04,140 --> 01:58:09,280
When I said stress test, I didn't realize it was gonna test me mentally as well.

2710
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:10,460
But here we are.

2711
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:13,280
Here we are.

2712
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:17,200
We got tested both mentally and physically.

2713
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,120
And on my PC.

2714
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:20,920
But I had a great time.

2715
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:25,120
I hope you guys had a great time hanging out with me too.

2716
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:30,100
As always everybody, say hi, join, pause, check in, and move around to get that blood flowing.

2717
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:31,960
And if you stood up for me, head to bed.

2718
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,460
Cause you deserve it.

2719
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:36,200
By the way guys, tomorrow is gonna be the God of War stream.

2720
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:38,760
So yeah, if you're looking for that, we're gonna have that tomorrow.

2721
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:40,340
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2722
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:41,320
Bye guys!

2723
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:42,140
Bye!
