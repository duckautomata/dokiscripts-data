1
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,980
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,460
Hello, hello.

3
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:54,400
Sorry, I've been getting so many, like, work messages and, um, like, stuff I have to do right before I stream.

4
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,900
So I have to, like, answer them and be like, oh, okay, I can get that done, like, real quick, just right before.

5
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,920
And I'll just loop one more time to get this done.

6
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,700
Everything.

7
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,660
It's really busy.

8
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:14,200
Really, really, really busy week this week as well as next week before, like, I think, like, as soon as the birthday stuff is over, like, things are gonna...

9
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,460
cool down a little bit and then get busy again.

10
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:24,700
But, but, yes, there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes right now.

11
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,520
Um, okay, do you guys want that update first or do you want announcement?

12
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,400
Well, not announcement, but more like, um, update.

13
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,300
A different update.

14
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,180
Uh, all right, that update or that update first.

15
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,080
Okay, that update.

16
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,400
Oh, it's not big announcement, guys.

17
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,540
It's not a really big announcement.

18
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,740
It's, it's, it's, it's merch related.

19
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,400
So it's not, it's not that big of an announcement, guys.

20
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,000
Um, okay, I'll do, uh, okay, let me read this.

21
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,400
Uh, uh, okay, I'll do, okay, I'll do that update first.

22
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,040
So I have to read, like, read the thing that I have to say later.

23
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,160
Um, anyway, so, dad update.

24
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,740
So, um, this happened a couple of days ago because I'm, like, spacing out these dad updates.

25
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:26,560
Um, so, um, so, basically, uh, a few days ago, I found out that dad can experience jealousy.

26
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:40,760
Because, um, I sat down on a bench and another dog came up to me and, like, jumped onto the bench next to me and sat next to me and was, like, hi.

27
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,000
And I was, like, hello there.

28
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,100
And then, and then, like, you know, like, I mean, I have a dog next to me.

29
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,880
So I was just, like, you know, I'm gonna pet you.

30
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,420
And then that dog was, like, super happy.

31
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,100
He's, like, yippee, pets.

32
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,940
And then, dad saw us.

33
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,400
He, he saw us and then started approaching us.

34
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,540
And he was, like, what the fuck are you doing in front of me?

35
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,900
And he got really mad.

36
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
He started, like, barking at us.

37
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,640
He's, like, what are you doing?

38
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,420
It's, like, how fucking dare you touch him in front of me?

39
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,020
He's, like, he was, like, really mad.

40
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,580
And he tried to, obviously, he's, like, really short.

41
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,080
He can't jump.

42
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,960
So, like, he tried to, like, you know, he tried to perch his legs on the bench.

43
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,200
He's, like, let me up!

44
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,160
Let me up!

45
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,880
Because he can't jump on the bench.

46
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,920
And then me and the other dog just, like, licked at him.

47
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,660
I was, like, I'm sorry.

48
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm sorry that he's, like, this to the other dog.

49
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,700
I'm just, like, what?

50
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,560
What, you can go up to other women and let them pet you, but I can't pet another dog?

51
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,200
Like, what about the quality here?

52
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,300
Why?

53
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,540
I have to watch you go up to other women and let them pet you.

54
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,540
You show your belly to them, but I can't touch another dog.

55
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,220
I...

56
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,020
Um, Petra...

57
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,120
Uh, Petra has said, thank you for the super chat.

58
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,120
Thank you, thank you.

59
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,340
I watched your fight against the Godskin Nova.

60
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,360
I just want to say, lol, nice one.

61
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,180
Thank you for the super chat.

62
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,300
Thank you, thank you.

63
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,640
I can't pet a different dog, apparently.

64
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,920
But yes, he had, um...

65
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,140
That's different, Doki.

66
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,220
Uh, but yes, he...

67
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,020
I found out that he does experience jealousy.

68
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,120
Because no other dog has actually, like, approached me before for, like, pets.

69
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,320
Like, usually the other dogs would just do their own thing.

70
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,020
They don't randomly approach owners.

71
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,300
Like, my dog.

72
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,780
Where dad would literally just, like, walk up to random people and just be like, Pet me!

73
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,100
But, like, this is the first time a dog actually went up to me.

74
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,660
And, like, sat, like, actually jumped onto the bench and sat next to me.

75
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,100
And was like, yay, you want to pet me?

76
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,080
I was like, okay.

77
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,340
Um, but yeah.

78
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,160
Anyway, so that's the dad...

79
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,100
That's the, uh, dad update.

80
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,440
Um, he...

81
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,740
He has finally experienced jealousy.

82
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,660
And he was not happy that I was petting other dogs.

83
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,360
All right!

84
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,420
Announcement time!

85
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,880
So, um, I was just sent in graphics for the birthday merch.

86
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,600
That will be, uh, the birthday concert merch.

87
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,860
Not the actual birthday merch.

88
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,860
Because there will be actual birthday merch.

89
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,960
But, uh, obviously.

90
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,880
Ha ha ha!

91
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,840
Handled by my new distributor.

92
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,080
Uh, so, um...

93
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,860
For those who are wondering, for the actual birthday merch that's coming out next week.

94
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,580
On my birthday.

95
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,460
Not the concert one.

96
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,000
Um, we're gonna have some of the stuff already in, um...

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,780
Um, in, uh, the warehouse.

98
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,140
So, some of the things.

99
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,940
If you're ordering, like...

100
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,420
If you're ordering, like, single items.

101
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,540
There will be, like, uh...

102
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,460
Some of them will ship out right away.

103
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,480
Uh, because we do already have some of the items in the warehouse.

104
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,000
Uh, we don't have all the items.

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,060
But we have some of them.

106
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,080
Um, but...

107
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
So, you're planning ordering the bundles.

108
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,540
You might have to wait, like, maybe, like, a month or two.

109
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,060
But it's already a lot faster than last year.

110
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:29,380
But, so, I just sent graphics for my concert birthday merch at Anime Expo.

111
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:39,360
And for those who are wondering, oh, I won't be at Anime Expo, we are planning on doing pre-orders for it after the concert.

112
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,080
But it will be like maybe like two weeks after, one to two weeks after the concert.

113
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,220
So, we are planning on doing pre-orders for it.

114
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,760
But for those who will be going to Anime Expo, I will be showcasing the graphics for it and where to find the booth.

115
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,660
For those who are like wondering, like, oh, where do I get these items and stuff like that.

116
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,400
So, like for those who are planning a trip to Anime Expo, let me grab the graphics real quick and show you guys.

117
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,700
Okay, let's see.

118
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,900
And then let me like copy the map too.

119
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:27,360
Okay, grabbing, I was literally, they literally sent this to me like two minutes before the stream, like, I'm sorry.

120
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,920
When the stream went live.

121
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,680
They sent this to me when the stream went live.

122
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,060
So, I was like, whoa, gotta grab everything.

123
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,160
So, here is the birthday concert merch.

124
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,680
So, you sort of see there's going to be like tickets, standee, buttons, and a sticker.

125
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,340
So, you know, it's not like that, like, like, because we have to get all of these done, like, within a month.

126
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,800
This was done within a month because, you know, was it in one month or a month and a half?

127
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,920
A little more than a month basically.

128
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:09,260
So, we have to get a lot of these done very soon so it's not like, obviously, it's not like super big merchandise stuff, but it's still a lot of cute things.

129
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,220
So, it will be at the Noms Cafe booth.

130
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,400
They will have a separate section that's dedicated to, dedicated to Doki Bird.

131
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,580
Me, as in me.

132
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,820
So, they have, like, a separate booth dedicated to me, and we will be selling concert merch.

133
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,220
So, I'll give you guys close-ups.

134
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,400
Yeah, it's on... my concert will be on July 3rd, but the booth will be there for the entire Anime Expo.

135
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,580
So, I'll give you guys, like, close-ups of the illustration.

136
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:46,300
So, we will have a standee and also a ticket right here.

137
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:57,460
The reason why we have two... the reason why we have two separate artwork is because we didn't know if we were going to get any of these artwork done in time.

138
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,460
So, I commissioned two different artists to see if we could get them done in time.

139
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,400
And luckily, both of them got them done in time.

140
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,220
So, because they were like, oh, you know, I don't know if I could get it done in time.

141
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,860
But luckily, we got both of the artwork done in time.

142
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,640
So, this one is buttons and stickers as well.

143
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,360
So, you can get dad button and me button and then a giant sticker.

144
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,720
I don't know how big the sticker is.

145
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,460
It might not be that big.

146
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:32,200
So, these will be merchandise at Anime Expo that you could get at my booth.

147
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,780
And this will be dedicated to the, um, birthday merch.

148
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,440
So, you can... if you guys want, you know, a more boorish outfit or a more girly outfit.

149
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,620
We have two types of do... we have two doki flavors.

150
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,300
So we can have two Doki flavors.

151
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,120
So the more girly Doki or the more boyish Doki.

152
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,680
So yeah, so these are the two different types of... not two, sorry.

153
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,940
Two different types of artworks you can get for your merch.

154
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,240
And the booth will be right here.

155
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,560
I know it's a little hard to see, but it's right there.

156
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,180
So, uh, right over here.

157
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,400
So it's next to... it's basically close to the Square Enix booth.

158
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,960
So it will be at booth 3724.

159
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,260
The... what is it called?

160
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,140
I don't fucking know.

161
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,080
The self-hall?

162
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,420
I think this is a self-hall.

163
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,340
It's right here.

164
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,160
Let me... right over here.

165
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,500
If you see Square Enix, you'll find the booth.

166
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,580
It's right there.

167
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:45,900
So if you are at Anime Expo, um, you will be able to grab these there.

168
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,400
We were planning... I know some of you guys were like, oh, is it gonna be exclusive merch?

169
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:56,440
We are planning on putting the merch on pre-order, but it will be after the...

170
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,380
It'll be after the con... it'll be after Anime Expo.

171
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,140
So it'll be maybe, like, a month... like, two... two weeks to a month, basically.

172
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,640
Um, for when you can get the merch for, uh, for the Anime Expo concert merch.

173
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,380
So these are, like, the concert merch, basically.

174
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,860
Um, there is gonna be, like, actual birthday birthday merch.

175
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,400
Uh, but that's the concert merch on itself.

176
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,760
Um, anything else?

177
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:32,880
Oh, yes, if you are at Anime Expo and you were never able to get the, uh, discontinued Doki merch, we are planning on selling some extra stock.

178
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,620
Uh, we have a couple of extra stock of the old merch.

179
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,320
So the Retro Edition and the Lunar New Year.

180
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:51,080
We're not planning on putting this back up on the online store, but they do have, because, uh, Nam's Cafe was actually, uh, helping me with distributing for, uh, my old merch.

181
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:59,280
Um, um, and helped me a bit with distributing a little bit of the old merch, uh, when, um, things were getting really delayed and everything.

182
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,260
So they do have some of the, uh, retro...

183
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,980
They do have, like, some remaining stock of the Retro Edition and the Lunar New Year merchandise.

184
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:17,120
So if you're at Anime Expo and you never were able to get any of this, these merch, merchandise, you can, you will be able to get them at Anime Expo.

185
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,760
Uh, so they will be selling the remaining stock of this there as well.

186
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,400
So, anything else?

187
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,140
Anything else?

188
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,380
Uh, I do also have a collab going with Nam's Cafe as well.

189
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,740
So there's a lot of merch there.

190
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,080
There's a lot of stuff.

191
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,700
So if you're at Anime Expo, I also have a collaboration with them.

192
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,820
So, um, so there's gonna be, like, little chibi stuff as well.

193
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,800
So you need to be wanting, like, more chibi stuff, chibi charms.

194
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,660
There's, like, charms, uh, a print as well.

195
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,260
And, uh, because they are also helping me with distribute...

196
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,820
They are helping me with selling my, uh, Anime Expo stuff.

197
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:06,980
So, um, I am doing a collaboration with them as well, since they are helping me out with selling, um, my Anime Expo concert merch, as well as, like, being there as a booth for me.

198
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,200
Um, because, like, you know, without them, I wouldn't even have, like, a booth there.

199
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,640
So, and it's, like, they...

200
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,200
It's, like, a whole...

201
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,080
They're dedicating, like, half of their booth to my stuff, too.

202
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,280
So it was really nice of them to do that.

203
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,320
So I, um, I was, like, yeah, we can do a collaboration as well at Anime Expo.

204
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,380
So, um, there's gonna be...

205
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,480
Anime Expo, if you're, like, looking at these things, I believe you can only get them at Anime Expo, this collaboration.

206
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,340
So, or, like, wherever conventions that Nam's Cafe is at.

207
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:40,260
So, um, you'll be able to grab these at, not, uh, at the Anime Expo booth as well.

208
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,700
So there's several collaboration in works.

209
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,660
Oh, well, several.

210
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,520
One collaboration.

211
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,440
There's, uh, there's one collaboration as well.

212
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,740
So, yes, that is all the updates regarding, uh, Anime Expo.

213
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,340
Um, the concert is at July 3rd at, I believe...

214
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,460
Oh, my gosh.

215
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,700
I think it was, like, 1 p.m.

216
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,360
or 2 p.m.

217
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,580
Um, I think so.

218
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,000
So, if you guys didn't know, there is a con...

219
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,700
I will be doing a 1 p.m.

220
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:14,760
I will be doing a Anime Expo, uh, 3D concert for, uh, on July 3rd.

221
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
Uh, but that doesn't mean July 4th.

222
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,720
There isn't also anything...

223
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,120
Uh, there's also something very special planned on July 4th.

224
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:28,500
And on July 3rd, I'll be doing a countdown stream where I'll be announcing something very, very special related to my birthday stream.

225
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,340
So, uh, uh, on July 3rd, uh, I will have a stream at night.

226
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,720
I think it'll be, like, at 11 p.m.

227
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,060
PST where I will be doing a countdown stream.

228
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,660
And, um, and, uh, I'll be doing a countdown stream.

229
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,680
And we will be announcing something very special, uh, that will lead up to my birthday.

230
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,560
So...

231
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,520
And there will be another announcement on my birthday at the end of the stream.

232
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,840
That's why I've been so busy.

233
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,980
There's so many announcements.

234
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,660
There's...

235
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,660
There's so many!

236
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,120
It's so hard to keep track.

237
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:13,100
So, there is a special announcement on the countdown stream and also a very special announcement at the end of my actual birthday stream.

238
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,100
And also, next week, there's a...

239
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,280
Finally, we're collabing with Chibi-Doki next week.

240
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,700
We're gonna play Roblox Doors.

241
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,360
Sorry, I just dumped everything onto you guys.

242
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,740
I...

243
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,160
Chibi-Doki and I finally have arranged a collab for next week.

244
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,940
So, the two Doki's are finally gonna do something.

245
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,780
It was very hard to organize, by the way, because we're both very, very busy people.

246
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,520
I think this collab has been in the works for, like, months now because we're always so fucking busy.

247
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,200
And then, like, because of that, we, like, don't respond to each other.

248
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,980
Like, when we're really busy.

249
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,300
Okay, sometimes it's me.

250
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,600
It's, like, both of us.

251
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,680
So, like, um...

252
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,300
At one point, like, we didn't talk to each other for, like, a month because, like, we were both so busy while we're in the middle of trying to organize a collab.

253
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,240
Because, like, I remember, it was, like...

254
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,400
Okay, so, like, recently...

255
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,440
The most recent one was basically, it was like, Oh, yeah, are you free next week?

256
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,860
And then I got sick.

257
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,200
And I was like, I'm sorry, I can't do it.

258
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,560
I'm, like, really sick right now.

259
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,280
I was like, I'm, like, super...

260
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,400
And then he's like, it's all right.

261
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:14,800
We can...

262
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,580
Oh, and then she was like, oh, I have to go travel next week.

263
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,620
But, like, I could do it, like, when I get back.

264
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,940
I was like, yeah, we could do that.

265
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,820
And then I replied.

266
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,480
And then, like, after she got back, she's like, oh, yeah, when you want to do it?

267
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,480
And I was like, I'm sorry.

268
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,780
I need to take a break right now.

269
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,700
I'm so burnt out.

270
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,420
And my brain is so fried.

271
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,200
And then she's like, oh, it's all right.

272
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,940
And I was like, sorry, I have to travel for this concert.

273
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,640
So, it was fucking...

274
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,740
We were all, like...

275
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,040
Like, there was always so many fucking delays leading up to this collab.

276
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,940
But now, confirmed.

277
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,360
Oh, yeah.

278
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,280
And then...

279
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,700
We were supposed to collab this week.

280
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,700
And then we were actually about to, like, announce...

281
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,040
Like, I was about to put it on my schedule.

282
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,660
It was supposed to be this week, too.

283
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,060
On Saturday.

284
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,140
And then we were...

285
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,800
I was about to put it on my schedule.

286
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,720
And then Saba announced that she was debuting on Saturday.

287
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,100
And then I was like, oh, Chibi.

288
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,020
It was like, oh, Chibi.

289
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,440
We got to reschedule.

290
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,040
I don't know what time that collab...

291
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,920
What time her debut is.

292
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
But, like, we can't do it on Saturday.

293
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,540
So, then it got pushed to next week.

294
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,140
Because it was just...

295
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,120
All of it just didn't fall in line.

296
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:20,740
Nothing.

297
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,540
And it was before Saba announced her debut time.

298
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,680
Because, like, I think she announced when she's debuting.

299
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,780
Like, today.

300
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,400
Or was it...

301
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,260
It was Iron Trader yesterday.

302
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,000
But, like, you know, when we were...

303
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,580
We had the collab planned on Saturday.

304
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,360
Like, we were talking about it on Monday.

305
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,080
We were like...

306
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,280
Oh, yeah.

307
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,800
On Sunday.

308
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,080
We were like, oh, yeah.

309
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,060
Let's, like, put the collab on Saturday.

310
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,440
And then...

311
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,040
And then we didn't know what time.

312
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,680
And then, like, you know, I checked.

313
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,020
We were like, yes, let's do it.

314
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,460
Yeah.

315
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:51,960
Yeah, all right.

316
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,400
Saturday.

317
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,620
And then...

318
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,580
And then, like...

319
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,940
And then I looked at my schedule.

320
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,000
And I was like, wait.

321
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,720
Isn't, like, Saba debuting this week?

322
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,380
What day was it?

323
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
And I looked at it.

324
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,180
I was like, oh, fuck.

325
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,540
Okay.

326
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,120
I was like, sorry, Chibi.

327
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,380
We gotta reschedule again.

328
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,340
Because we can't do it this Saturday.

329
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,100
And Chibi was busy the entire week.

330
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,580
She was busy on, like, Thursday.

331
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,000
Um, Thursday, Friday, and Friday.

332
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,440
So then I was just like, oh, fuck it.

333
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,680
We'll push it to next week.

334
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,100
Oh,

335
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,440
fuck it.

336
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,520
Oh, fuck it.

337
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,300
I was like, oh, fuck it.

338
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:25,540
Okay.

339
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,420
Next week, then.

340
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,540
Next week, Saturday.

341
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,480
Nothing is gonna be in our way this time.

342
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,100
Nothing.

343
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,460
We will be okay this time.

344
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,160
Um, so, um, yeah, sorry.

345
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,380
Wednesday, Thursday.

346
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,500
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, she was busy.

347
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,180
So, like, basically, like, we, the whole week, this week, it was just, like, impossible for us.

348
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,180
And that's why!

349
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,120
If the collab was pushed to next week.

350
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,100
Um, next, next week, thank you for the super chat.

351
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,120
Thank you, thank you.

352
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,640
But are you going to use the Chibi-Doki so you can be Chibi-Doki and Chibi-Doki?

353
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,380
No, so then, so people can distinguish between the Doki.

354
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,580
One will be Chibi, and then the other one will be regular-sized Doki.

355
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,980
Thank you for the super chat.

356
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,480
Thank you, thank you.

357
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,460
So, so, finally, the collab won't be rescheduled.

358
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,020
Finally!

359
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,280
Um, yes, it's big Doki and little Doki.

360
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,700
Anyway, it's Elder Ring time.

361
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,220
All right, so I played around with some more fixes to see if I could...

362
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,240
I don't know, it was for some fucker reason.

363
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,840
That world was so fucked up in Elder Ring.

364
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,480
That was, like, I don't know why.

365
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,240
Maybe it was because I had maximum grass.

366
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,520
But, like...

367
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,660
That shit, like, stuttered, like, crazy compared...

368
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,280
Because, like, the other playthroughs, it was...

369
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,240
There was still some stuttering, but it wasn't that bad.

370
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,420
For some fucking reason, Lava Mane was so fucked up.

371
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,120
All right, I did save my sound settings for Halo this time.

372
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,740
So, we should be good to go.

373
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,780
Wait, I didn't.

374
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,920
JK.

375
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,940
I did not.

376
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,660
But that's okay.

377
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,420
Like, I can do...

378
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,420
I can save it now.

379
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,000
Because I haven't adjusted my sound system yet.

380
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:12,800
All right.

381
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,060
And then, I think...

382
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,920
Let me double check.

383
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,260
Uh...

384
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:17,540
Okay.

385
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,280
Eleven.

386
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,380
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

387
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,060
There we go.

388
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,780
Gotta make sure the sound is all correct.

389
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,580
All right.

390
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,020
I don't know if I fixed it.

391
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,940
But, like, maybe it'll be a little better.

392
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,700
Maybe.

393
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,180
Okay.

394
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,760
Let's...

395
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,120
Let's make sure...

396
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,720
I'm just gonna make sure that...

397
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:39,820
Uh...

398
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,800
I'm just changing the graphics real quick.

399
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,920
You're like, I can't see anything!

400
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,500
It's okay.

401
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,420
You're not missing out much.

402
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,740
I'm literally just on the settings, guys.

403
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,240
Okay.

404
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,640
Advance.

405
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,180
Okay.

406
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,840
It's on high.

407
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,180
Okay.

408
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,480
Good.

409
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,140
All right.

410
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,380
Everything seems to be okay.

411
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,700
And I put grass on medium.

412
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:56,860
Uh...

413
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,180
Justin, thank you for the super chat.

414
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,520
Thank you.

415
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,120
Thank you.

416
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,520
You should be croaky during your collab with Chibi-Doki.

417
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,560
So you can both be the same size.

418
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Thank you for the super chat, Justin.

419
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,140
Thank you.

420
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,580
Thank you.

421
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,760
It's actually crazy the amount of stuff I have to, like, play around with for Elden Ring.

422
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,820
So, I'm on borderless window now.

423
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,640
So, um...

424
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,280
How the fuck are my messages are still there?

425
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:19,580
I was...

426
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,380
So...

427
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,520
I'm on borderless window.

428
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,060
So, I don't know if that will work.

429
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,640
But, like, that was apparently one of the fixes.

430
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,240
All right.

431
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,080
Apparently...

432
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,880
Guys, okay.

433
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,380
There's, like, a little silver war going on in my chat.

434
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,360
And, like, in the Dragoon community about whether or not she'll be doing this side quest.

435
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,840
Like, guys are saying...

436
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,120
Some of you guys are saying she's never gonna use any of these items in the chat.

437
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,260
So, is that true, guys?

438
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,800
Am I picking up items that I will never use?

439
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Or am I actually picking up items that...

440
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,540
That I am never going to equip, guys?

441
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,540
Is that true?

442
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,700
Yes, I don't care.

443
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
Do the side...

444
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,580
Who cares if she uses them or not?

445
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,180
What do you mean?

446
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,820
Who cares?

447
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,040
I care!

448
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,420
What do you mean?

449
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,000
What's the point?

450
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,380
The side quest and the rewards aren't worth it!

451
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,700
They are essential.

452
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,920
You get a legendary...

453
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,880
Yes, but am I gonna use it as a thing?

454
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,620
I already got a fucking 0.05...

455
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,180
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1% item drop on my first try.

456
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,460
And I'm not even using that item.

457
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,340
Alright.

458
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,800
How about this, guys?

459
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,020
We'll do...

460
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,820
Put the story in lore.

461
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,240
Guys, we already killed Patches.

462
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,340
What other...

463
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,300
We already killed him.

464
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,740
I think the story part is already shut down.

465
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,200
Okay.

466
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,500
Okay, but it's the poison katana.

467
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,940
Better than my current katana.

468
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,300
Guys.

469
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,480
Besides...

470
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,360
Patcher...

471
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,800
Or Anton!

472
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,020
Patcher Esu!

473
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,120
Thank you for the super chat.

474
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,480
Thank you.

475
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,260
Thank you.

476
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,440
It's content.

477
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,120
And people like the heckin' cute characters.

478
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,800
Besides Moonvale or Rivers of Blood, which are not side quest rewards.

479
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,740
We probably won't change weapons this run.

480
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,100
Okay.

481
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,940
Say goodbye to that red spot.

482
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,860
But I can use two katanas.

483
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,460
Wait!

484
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,820
I can use two katanas?

485
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,320
Okay.

486
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:42,620
Wait.

487
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:42,900
Okay.

488
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,900
Now you're speaking my language, guys.

489
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,680
Guys.

490
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,060
Okay.

491
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,900
Now you're speaking my language.

492
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,700
What...

493
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,140
Will my two katanas do more damage?

494
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,520
Versus one katana...

495
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:54,700
Oh yeah.

496
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,460
My death counter.

497
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,320
Why did...

498
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,520
The important thing is...

499
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,860
Will my two katanas...

500
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,680
Do more damage...

501
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,260
Than my one katana?

502
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,820
Yes?

503
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,280
Alright.

504
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,040
See?

505
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,620
You should have started with that.

506
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,620
Guys.

507
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,340
If you guys started with...

508
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,820
You can get two katanas.

509
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,180
We'd be down there already.

510
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:19,820
Alright.

511
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,780
It's like here somewhere.

512
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,200
I don't know.

513
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,400
Somewhere here.

514
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,600
Didn't expect dragon.

515
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,080
Okay.

516
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,400
Loco.

517
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,620
Thank you for the super chat.

518
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,040
Thank you.

519
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,800
Thank you.

520
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,740
Thank you, Doki.

521
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,080
For being a little goofy goober.

522
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,500
We all love and enjoy.

523
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,280
Guys.

524
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,120
What do you mean it's our fault that I'm...

525
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,140
You didn't mention two katanas.

526
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,300
All you did was like...

527
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,060
There's loot.

528
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,560
What kind of loot?

529
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,940
I need details.

530
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,440
Okay.

531
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,300
Alright.

532
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,740
Oh my god.

533
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,040
Me and my horse...

534
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,500
Is having a rough time.

535
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,100
No down ahead.

536
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,680
Okay.

537
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,620
Then why am I here?

538
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,920
What the fuck?

539
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,480
Oh, is it here?

540
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,220
Try jumping up?

541
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,060
Oh, there it is.

542
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,860
Okay, maybe...

543
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,960
Yeah, maybe this would help me.

544
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,020
I think I need a nightlight.

545
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:31,880
Here.

546
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,260
Okay.

547
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,300
This has to be it.

548
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,120
What's this?

549
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,520
Oh, no horses allowed.

550
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,000
If only...

551
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
I had a horse.

552
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,080
Professor Oak is like...

553
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,220
This is not the time and place for this right now.

554
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,220
I got Professor Oak'd.

555
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,240
Hey.

556
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,600
Apparently, uh...

557
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,940
There is a dragon here.

558
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,140
What?

559
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,140
It's so empty.

560
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,410
Oh, Zyko.

561
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,530
Thank you for the super chat.

562
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:09,890
Thank you.

563
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,510
Thank you.

564
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,410
Naga.

565
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,030
Kaiba.

566
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,950
The longest katana.

567
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:13,810
Poison katana.

568
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,330
Oh, wait.

569
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,390
There is River of Blood.

570
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,190
The best bleed katana.

571
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,750
Oh my god.

572
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,910
There's so many katanas.

573
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,210
How many katanas do I need?

574
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,850
Thank you for the super chat.

575
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,230
Thank you.

576
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:23,970
Thank you.

577
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,430
No secret ahead.

578
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:27,650
Wait.

579
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,370
Why am I here?

580
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,230
Oh.

581
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,690
Okay.

582
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,310
JK.

583
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,390
I didn't see below me.

584
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:33,170
Oh.

585
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,650
There's a dragon down here.

586
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,150
Isn't it?

587
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,870
There is a dragon.

588
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,750
Thank you for the super chat.

589
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,130
Thank you.

590
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:42,570
Thank you.

591
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:42,930
Toki.

592
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,710
If you play the DLC right at the beginning, you can get the cool dragon katana.

593
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,070
Thank you for the super chat.

594
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,390
Thank you.

595
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:48,810
Guys.

596
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,210
You did say...

597
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:50,490
What was it?

598
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,170
Seven bosses?

599
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,050
Guys.

600
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,210
If you want me to...

601
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,570
If you want me to...

602
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,410
Do the DLC...

603
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,650
That concert was very expensive.

604
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,470
You had a crowd fun for that.

605
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,890
You had a crowd fun for the DLC.

606
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,110
Don't worry.

607
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,390
Down ahead.

608
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,710
Therefore, try jumping.

609
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,130
Okay.

610
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,110
Beware.

611
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,450
Oh wait.

612
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,070
Is that pit?

613
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,670
Yeah.

614
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,770
That's a fucking pit right there.

615
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,580
All right.

616
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,640
It's either we crowd fun or 900k.

617
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,360
And I'll continue Elden Ring.

618
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,700
900k subscribers.

619
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,300
I'll continue Elden Ring.

620
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,260
Next thing.

621
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,960
Thank you for the Akasupa.

622
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,520
Thank you.

623
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,200
Thank you.

624
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:39,820
Alan.

625
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,080
Thank you for the super chat.

626
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,540
Thank you.

627
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,320
Thank you.

628
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,120
We're playing Elden Ring for charity here.

629
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,360
At that time, it was for the...

630
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,380
What was it?

631
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,560
The mental health charity.

632
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,720
Now, I'm the charity.

633
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,080
To progress past seven story bosses, you need to help me.

634
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,140
I'm the charity.

635
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,220
Okay.

636
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,200
We go straight?

637
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,520
Is this actually where...

638
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:07,980
Okay.

639
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,220
Wait.

640
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,800
I think I actually fixed the stutters, guys.

641
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,640
I say maybe...

642
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:13,940
Wait.

643
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,620
I think I fixed it.

644
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,580
God fucking damn it.

645
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,420
I've only did that before.

646
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,420
I've only...

647
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,940
Zekra, thank you for the Akasupa.

648
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,040
Thank you.

649
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,980
Can I also contribute...

650
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,860
Funding for DLC shenanigans.

651
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,040
Frozen, thank you for the super chat.

652
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,460
Thank you.

653
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,220
Thank you.

654
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,120
What's this?

655
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,110
Try lightning.

656
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,610
Alright, it's too late.

657
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,290
Betrayal, no treasure ahead.

658
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,350
Oh shit, I feel it.

659
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,350
I feel like these guys are gonna fucking push me off the clip.

660
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,510
We're in a Doki charity.

661
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,350
Thank you for the super chat, Mike.

662
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,970
You'll understand why.

663
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,930
Later on when...

664
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,350
After the concert, you'll understand why.

665
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,970
Why we need a crowd fund for more Elden Ring.

666
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,490
You'll understand.

667
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,720
Alright.

668
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,180
Oh shit, that's not why I want Waste God.

669
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,140
Am I like...

670
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,080
Heading the...

671
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,600
What the fuck?

672
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,540
How did you miss three times?

673
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,700
Couldn't be me.

674
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,740
You'll understand.

675
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,820
Something incredible ahead?

676
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,180
Wait, how did all these guys die?

677
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,110
My first Akasupa to contribute.

678
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,550
Zekra, thank you for the Akasupa.

679
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,830
Thank you, thank you.

680
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,530
Alright.

681
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:46,930
Oh, there's a...

682
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,070
No, that's for...

683
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,390
That's not an important item, right?

684
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,330
Wait, these guys are so easy to kill.

685
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,950
I don't understand.

686
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,010
Toki is suffering charity.

687
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,310
Thank you for the...

688
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,810
Oh shit.

689
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:01,490
What the fuck?

690
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,490
How did you miss that?

691
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,910
Thank you for the Akasupa airport.

692
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,590
Thank you.

693
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,350
Thank you.

694
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:08,990
Okay.

695
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,330
Let's grab this guy.

696
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,410
I feel like I don't...

697
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,710
I swear to...

698
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:14,970
Whoa.

699
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,750
Did I get it?

700
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,910
What pushed he...

701
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,710
Guys, he...

702
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,750
He jumped off first.

703
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,850
I didn't do it.

704
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,870
I'm not a murderer.

705
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,430
He jumped off first.

706
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:29,870
Okay.

707
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,190
No snow horse ahead.

708
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,350
Liar ahead.

709
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,370
Am I like over leveled for this area?

710
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,170
I was like, Why did all these people die?

711
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,250
I have to be over leveled.

712
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,970
Or were they pushed off?

713
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,210
Oh, they were just pushed off?

714
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,130
Asim, thank you for the super chat.

715
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:51,530
Thank you.

716
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,250
Thank you.

717
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,990
I'm doing...

718
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,050
I'm doing my part.

719
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,770
Jumping require...

720
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,690
That has to be a lie.

721
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,110
Lie.

722
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,530
Poor...

723
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,050
Okay, guys.

724
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:05,390
Guys.

725
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,830
All right.

726
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,050
Wait, where is it?

727
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,290
Necessary item ahead.

728
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,110
All right.

729
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,090
Make sure when you're here, make sure to upload this.

730
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,430
Downvote this.

731
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,790
And then upload this.

732
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,590
Uh-oh.

733
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,190
AHHHHHHHHH!

734
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,840
Where am I?

735
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:47,800
There!

736
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,700
I don't like...

737
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,240
Oh!

738
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,500
I'm different!

739
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,920
I don't know how...

740
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,930
I just tried to be unclear.

741
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,710
I jumped off the cliff.

742
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:14,690
I...

743
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,410
Okay, I want more Elden right now.

744
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,510
Look, thank you for the super chat.

745
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,090
I don't know how to get back...

746
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,320
I...

747
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,620
Where is it?

748
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,000
I... I don't know where it is.

749
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,860
Okay, I think it's... I'm gonna explain that again.

750
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,940
Okay, I'm back.

751
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,940
I'm back.

752
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,220
I'm back.

753
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,500
Okay, let me figure out how to get there again.

754
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,900
It's so long.

755
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,820
I think it was here.

756
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,060
Okay.

757
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,720
Okay, I remember.

758
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,420
I'm pretty sure.

759
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,880
Okay, I remember.

760
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,700
Carbo is real.

761
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,640
I accidentally pressed circle.

762
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,600
I'm so sad.

763
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:07,980
I jump.

764
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,520
No!

765
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,920
My sauce!

766
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,460
Why did I jump?

767
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,660
Oh!

768
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,410
Okay, I remember.

769
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,310
I'll get back though.

770
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:20,350
Oh!

771
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,850
Why did I jump?

772
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,270
Oh!

773
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,760
I forgot the plan!

774
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,840
I thought I could make it!

775
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,600
Oh my god, thank you for the super chat.

776
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,200
Thank you.

777
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,920
Thank you.

778
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,160
Doki is a true leader.

779
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,560
Oh my god, please.

780
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,100
I'm already having a bad day, Mr. Bear.

781
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,540
I'm sorry!

782
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,100
Okay.

783
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,220
Alright.

784
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:52,700
Alright.

785
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:52,900
I remember.

786
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,520
I'll get there.

787
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,840
Oh my item.

788
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,940
My runes!

789
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,920
My beautiful runes!

790
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,140
What did I do to deserve it?

791
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:14,040
I can't possibly think of what I did to deserve this.

792
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,780
I...

793
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,860
I... I don't understand.

794
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,060
What could I have possibly done to deserve this?

795
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,380
Okay.

796
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,280
How the fuck do I...

797
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,420
Oh, it's right here.

798
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,820
The worst part is that I made it through, like, all the bullshit here.

799
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,980
And then I died to, like, the dumbest thing.

800
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,680
Alright.

801
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,960
Uh, terminated.

802
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,960
Thank you for the super chat.

803
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,820
Thank you, thank you.

804
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,660
I, too, would like to contribute to this crowdfund, as we need more Elder Ring Souls content from Doki.

805
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,960
Also, Doki, watch where you land.

806
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
Oh my god.

807
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,040
This is right here.

808
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,760
I almost forgot how to traverse this place.

809
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:08,960
Okay.

810
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,240
I'm okay, guys.

811
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,060
I'm so healthy.

812
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,580
I'm so healthy.

813
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,230
Alright.

814
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,650
Everything is okay.

815
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,490
I made it.

816
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,830
I made it.

817
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,610
I'm back.

818
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,790
Guys, I'm back where I started.

819
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,690
Alright, here we go.

820
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,690
All for this stupid fucking side quest.

821
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:52,900
Okay.

822
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:54,920
Alright.

823
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,680
We gotta go this way.

824
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,660
Get over here.

825
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,960
I'm mad.

826
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,100
I'm mad now.

827
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,520
Get your ass over here.

828
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,700
Oh my god.

829
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,280
Okay, now I understand how you can die here.

830
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,120
Now I understand.

831
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,060
Now I understand.

832
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,060
Now I understand.

833
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,220
Now I understand.

834
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,660
Okay.

835
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,260
I understand that.

836
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,480
I might get knocked off.

837
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:25,620
Alright.

838
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,620
We're fine.

839
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,580
Oh my god.

840
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,400
I actually fixed it.

841
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,320
Why did I not do this sooner?

842
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,080
Okay, anyway.

843
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,620
As I was saying, make sure to upload this.

844
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,200
Uh...

845
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,660
No!

846
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,300
Oh my god!

847
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,140
I almost did it again!

848
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,080
Okay.

849
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,860
Okay.

850
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,700
Okay.

851
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,620
Okay.

852
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,780
And then, upload this.

853
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,260
Okay.

854
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,340
I almost did it again.

855
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,260
I know.

856
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,580
Okay.

857
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,040
It's fine.

858
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,940
It's fine.

859
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:53,740
We're okay.

860
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,600
We're okay.

861
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,040
Everything is okay.

862
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,240
I keep pressing circle accidentally.

863
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,140
Alright.

864
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,560
Seek left and then precious item.

865
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,040
Here.

866
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,140
Okay.

867
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,400
Oh, there is the precious item.

868
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,540
Oh, you didn't die.

869
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,200
Hahaha.

870
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,180
She just doesn't learn.

871
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,200
I...

872
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,240
Look, I did...

873
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,360
I'm learning now.

874
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,560
I'm learning now, chat.

875
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,880
I figured it out.

876
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,040
Try horseback battle.

877
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,140
Oh, can I...

878
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,840
Use my great...

879
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,740
Use my horse now?

880
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,160
That's what I didn't expect.

881
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,740
Behold summoning...

882
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,300
Oh, what?

883
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,340
Okay.

884
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,800
Uh...

885
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,660
No, I can't.

886
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,600
Wait, what?

887
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,700
Why did I say horseback battle?

888
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,540
I'm confused.

889
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,420
Do I live?

890
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,580
Okay, I live.

891
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,520
Okay.

892
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,580
I'm always worried about that.

893
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:01,810
Okay.

894
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,030
Those deaths don't count, guys.

895
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,070
They don't count.

896
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,030
I didn't die, but...

897
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,950
The environment does not count, guys.

898
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,590
The environment means nothing.

899
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,670
The environment deaths are not real.

900
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,330
Oh my God.

901
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,210
We'll get rid of him first.

902
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:23,250
We'll get rid of him first.

903
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,120
Oh my god.

904
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,480
Guys, okay, actually, I'm just gonna lean...

905
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,640
I'm not just... Oh, thank god there's a grace.

906
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,960
Oh, thank god, okay.

907
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,340
I'm... I got worried.

908
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,720
Gravity... Gravity does not count.

909
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,200
Okay, like, when you trip and fall, you don't go to the hospital.

910
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,640
Okay, I'm here now.

911
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,040
Oh my god, wait, he has fucking armor.

912
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,740
Okay.

913
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,440
Oh my god!

914
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,820
What's this?

915
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,800
Oh shit!

916
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,820
There we go, that's fine.

917
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,100
That's fine.

918
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,560
Oh shit, wait, that's not fine.

919
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,520
There's something to do with these spirits.

920
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,280
I don't like it.

921
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,010
Okay, we gotta get rid of these guys though.

922
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:27,770
Alright.

923
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,910
I'm like a little... a little scared.

924
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:30,350
Don't worry.

925
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,850
That arrow in my head, it just missed my brain.

926
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:34,510
So we're fine.

927
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,350
You know like those like...

928
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:45,310
Like, you know like sometimes bullets basically like get past all your internal organs?

929
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,450
That's what happened to me.

930
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,550
It literally just missed my brain.

931
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,990
Like it's crazy.

932
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,550
Oh my god, I hit every fucking wall?!

933
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,770
Holy shit!

934
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,470
Okay, we're okay.

935
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,950
I somehow hit every single wall there.

936
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,010
Wait, where am I?

937
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,150
What the fuck?!

938
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,750
Oh, I'm here.

939
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:15,130
Okay, is this part of the side quest?!

940
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,310
Yeah, I'm like in the...

941
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,390
Okay, yes.

942
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,890
Okay, I got a worry there.

943
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,550
I was like, I don't know if this is...

944
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,430
I couldn't tell.

945
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,610
Alright, let's grab this guy.

946
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,930
Let's just backstab him.

947
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,270
Here we go.

948
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,450
Yeah, that's on Neo.

949
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,330
Ooh!

950
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,550
Wait, I need all of these.

951
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:47,270
Nice.

952
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,850
Neo is just chilling.

953
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:58,810
Alright.

954
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,430
Let's get rid of him.

955
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,750
Bye!

956
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,230
Yay!

957
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,250
Why is he fighting this guy?

958
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:11,930
Yeah.

959
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,470
Get out of here!

960
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:14,730
I'm faster.

961
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:18,570
Yeah.

962
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,750
Alright.

963
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,210
I think this is a good place.

964
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,570
Alright.

965
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,690
This is a good place for this.

966
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,330
I'm like 13.

967
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,290
Alright.

968
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,950
This is my message of praise section.

969
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,550
Right here, with a view.

970
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,210
I think it's a nice...

971
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,430
Nice place for it.

972
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,770
I like kill everything here.

973
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,330
Alright.

974
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,190
Let me go this way.

975
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,490
A very lovely place.

976
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,310
I hope that's...

977
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,790
I hope that's the...

978
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,550
I hope that was from...

979
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,130
From where I just put the...

980
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:07,370
Whoa!

981
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:11,230
Oh my god.

982
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,390
That better be where I just put my last message.

983
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,410
That better be it.

984
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,510
I better go back there and see...

985
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,290
Like...

986
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:18,730
One...

987
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,390
Upvote on that message of praise.

988
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:23,170
Okay.

989
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,550
We need this for jellyfish.

990
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:27,310
Nice.

991
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:29,930
Alright.

992
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:30,850
Then we'll kill this guy.

993
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,230
Oh my god.

994
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:32,450
Oh my god.

995
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:32,450
Look.

996
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:32,910
No...

997
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:33,510
Actual...

998
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,410
No more studies.

999
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:35,650
Oh my god.

1000
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:36,970
It only took five parts.

1001
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:38,390
Wait...

1002
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,110
It actually...

1003
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,950
Guys, it only took me five parts to figure that out.

1004
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:43,890
To fix this.

1005
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,710
So apparently...

1006
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,070
Elder Ring has this weird thing...

1007
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:49,750
Where like...

1008
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,010
You can't play Elder Ring on full screen...

1009
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,330
If you have a monitor...

1010
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,770
That goes above 60 hertz.

1011
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:57,170
Which is...

1012
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:57,850
Fucking crazy.

1013
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:58,490
Like...

1014
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,070
That's...

1015
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,670
Like you have to play it...

1016
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:01,190
On...

1017
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,450
Borderless window.

1018
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,810
Because like...

1019
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,610
It will stutter because of it.

1020
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:07,790
Yeah.

1021
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,810
So I have to...

1022
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,290
I had to play on...

1023
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,010
Borderless window.

1024
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,210
Uh...

1025
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:12,890
Because like...

1026
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,410
I...

1027
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,690
My hertz was like...

1028
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,950
Higher than the game itself.

1029
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:17,390
So...

1030
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,250
Uh...

1031
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,430
Uh...

1032
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,110
So like...

1033
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:22,810
Uh...

1034
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,410
So that's what was causing the studies.

1035
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,390
Because the...

1036
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,130
Elden Ring can't...

1037
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,010
Deal with...

1038
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:28,890
Like any...

1039
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,190
Can't deal with monitors...

1040
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,130
Higher than...

1041
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:31,670
Oh my god.

1042
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:32,630
I should have killed you first.

1043
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:34,250
Uh...

1044
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,790
That's higher than...

1045
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:36,430
60.

1046
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,270
Which is fucking weird.

1047
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,390
That's so weird.

1048
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,560
Yeah.

1049
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,440
So that's why...

1050
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,720
So now we don't stutter anymore.

1051
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,540
This is not for Volcano Matt!

1052
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,420
Where the fuck am I?

1053
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,500
Oh, these fuckers.

1054
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,500
Oh, these fuckers.

1055
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,620
Me...

1056
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,760
I'm for mimicry?

1057
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,580
Alright, at least we're at...

1058
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,820
We're at some fucking random boss, I guess.

1059
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,580
What the fuck?

1060
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,520
Wait, that's...

1061
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,280
Who is he?

1062
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,660
Oh my god!

1063
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,380
Who are you?

1064
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,280
What the fuck?

1065
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,140
She has a whip!

1066
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,560
Hit!

1067
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,560
Alright.

1068
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,220
What the fuck is this guy?

1069
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,040
What the fuck?

1070
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,140
Okay, I'm trying like figure out her like pattern, but she...

1071
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,820
Okay, I didn't need a fig...

1072
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,380
Alright, jump.

1073
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:58,760
Yes.

1074
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,140
Yes.

1075
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,020
You're so close.

1076
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:02,640
Okay.

1077
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,260
I...

1078
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,100
Whoa.

1079
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,560
Whoa.

1080
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,340
Okay.

1081
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,860
You're like not that scary actually.

1082
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:12,900
I'm sorry.

1083
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,860
I'm so sorry.

1084
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,140
I am so sorry for saying that.

1085
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:16,620
You're...

1086
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,520
You are so scary.

1087
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,060
Oh my god.

1088
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:24,820
You're right.

1089
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,760
Oh my god.

1090
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,980
Maybe she was scary.

1091
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,800
The ego check.

1092
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,080
Okay.

1093
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,640
There she is.

1094
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,080
Ah!

1095
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,320
That's where I was before.

1096
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,680
We might need to find some churches here.

1097
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,020
What the fuck?

1098
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,200
Oh, is that a trap?

1099
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,780
Oop, that's funny.

1100
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,660
Oh, yeah, that was a trap.

1101
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,200
Big fan of don't have more fun at the park next time, Igor Samoyan.

1102
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,600
Thank you for the super chat.

1103
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,980
Thank you, thank you.

1104
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,180
All right, let's get these guys out of the way.

1105
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:26,940
All right.

1106
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:29,680
Okay.

1107
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,300
Wait, there's something here.

1108
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,340
Oh, I missed an item here.

1109
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,040
Yeah, I definitely wish I knew that earlier on about the borderless window thing.

1110
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,660
Then we didn't have to deal with all those stutters.

1111
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,740
I wasn't too intrusive, guys.

1112
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,840
I hope those stutters weren't too intrusive in the earlier playthroughs.

1113
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:01,810
Down item.

1114
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:05,670
First off, behind.

1115
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:06,750
Oh, there it is.

1116
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,510
All right, it wasn't that bad.

1117
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,050
That's good.

1118
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,410
Now it's, uh...

1119
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:19,850
But now, now it's easier.

1120
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,570
All right.

1121
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:21,750
It's time.

1122
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,640
Wait.

1123
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,500
Offer joy.

1124
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,140
Weakest boss ahead?

1125
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,740
This boss is a joke?

1126
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,800
Okay, guys, I don't...

1127
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,360
Pathetic sword ahead!

1128
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,940
Guys, I don't know.

1129
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,000
I feel like I may or may not be getting gaslit, too.

1130
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,800
It's all right.

1131
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,580
All right.

1132
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:58,700
Hello.

1133
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,360
Hello?

1134
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,240
Is it this guy?

1135
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,740
Wait, that's it?

1136
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,340
Wait, it's me.

1137
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,120
Wait, it's me.

1138
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,220
Oh, shit!

1139
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,140
Are you saying he's weak because he's me?

1140
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,900
Oh, that's what you meant!

1141
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,220
Oh, I'm so dumb!

1142
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,300
It's me!

1143
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,820
That's how you're like!

1144
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,000
Don't worry, Doki.

1145
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,020
She's so weak.

1146
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:34,800
Hey!

1147
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:35,460
Hey!

1148
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,120
Hey!

1149
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,740
Hey!

1150
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,480
He is strong, all right?

1151
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,860
She will be the strongest opponent I've ever faced, guys!

1152
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,880
Oh, my God!

1153
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,140
Oh, my God!

1154
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,520
Why are you using your hands?

1155
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,560
Oh, my God!

1156
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,300
Oh, she is me!

1157
00:51:59,300 --> 00:51:59,860
She...

1158
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,560
Bro, she doesn't even know what to do!

1159
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,740
She's just as confused as me!

1160
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,720
You heard a Doko bird?

1161
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,480
This is a bird Doki.

1162
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,440
Oh, my God!

1163
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,780
She doesn't even know my patterns!

1164
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,160
Wait, no, she does know my patterns!

1165
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,140
She's...

1166
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,460
He actually used his lucky fist!

1167
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,480
Because that's what I've done before!

1168
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:28,700
I...

1169
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,880
She is...

1170
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,560
She is me!

1171
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,020
Boki Dirt!

1172
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:35,880
Oh, my God!

1173
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,840
It's Boki Dirt!

1174
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,700
Oh, my God!

1175
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,420
Oh, my God!

1176
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,840
The one time I lock it in!

1177
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,280
The one time Boki Dirt locks it in!

1178
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,700
Oh, my God!

1179
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,980
Okay, that's not fair!

1180
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,720
My Oshi Boki Dirt!

1181
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,000
It's bad!

1182
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,100
Oh, my God!

1183
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,280
Look!

1184
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,440
She's rolling so much!

1185
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,380
I do that, too!

1186
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,400
Look!

1187
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,320
She's panic rolling!

1188
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,540
Oh, my God!

1189
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,420
She can heal!

1190
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,380
Message of Praise!

1191
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,120
Guys, how many times can I heal, guys?

1192
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:12,860
I need to know!

1193
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,520
Oh, my God!

1194
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:18,740
What?

1195
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,660
Dude!

1196
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,700
He's like, what do I use?

1197
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,880
You always get so confused!

1198
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,480
What do I use?

1199
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,080
That's me, too!

1200
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,720
Me, too, Boki Dirt!

1201
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,320
Sometimes, I don't know what I'm doing, either!

1202
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,100
Okay, nice!

1203
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,680
Whoa!

1204
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,540
Which one is the real Doki Dirt?

1205
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,340
I can't tell!

1206
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,520
They're both!

1207
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,260
I can't tell!

1208
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,300
Which one is her?

1209
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,420
Same.

1210
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,120
Oh, my God!

1211
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,900
She's panic rolling and everything!

1212
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:52,840
Oh, my God!

1213
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,580
She does jump attacks like me!

1214
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,960
It's okay, I'll kill her by...

1215
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
with pure poison.

1216
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,880
The real Boki Dirt way.

1217
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,360
There we go, we did it!

1218
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,580
Yeah!

1219
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,780
Yay!

1220
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,000
We did it!

1221
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,220
So easy!

1222
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,520
We won!

1223
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,940
We defeated Boki Dirt!

1224
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,960
Alright, here we go.

1225
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,900
I guess we go this way.

1226
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:26,960
Oh, Grace!

1227
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:26,980
Nice!

1228
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,200
How do I raise a message for the other one?

1229
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,120
Cora!

1230
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,780
Thank you for the super chat!

1231
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,780
Thank you, thank you!

1232
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:38,460
Workshop!

1233
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,820
The best way to be a double ganger!

1234
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,900
Thank you for the super chat!

1235
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:43,820
Thank you, thank you!

1236
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,640
Alright.

1237
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,400
Oh, wait.

1238
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,680
I think I have enough runes, actually, for this.

1239
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,060
How much do I need?

1240
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,900
I can...

1241
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,800
Oh, I can just use that.

1242
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,040
I think it was like...

1243
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,500
Yeah.

1244
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,820
5k should be enough.

1245
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,760
Uh, Brewer!

1246
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,600
Thank you for the super chat!

1247
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,540
Thank you, thank you!

1248
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,840
Is that fight murder or suicide?

1249
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,900
Um, do we do dexterity?

1250
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:12,500
Right?

1251
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,560
Dexterity.

1252
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,060
Alright.

1253
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,420
And then what do we do after dexterity, guys?

1254
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,080
The weakest doki had to...

1255
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,260
Had to 2v1 the other doki.

1256
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,140
Shake my head!

1257
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,340
Time for horse!

1258
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:32,800
Try horse.

1259
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,720
Wait, isn't that, like, where...

1260
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,760
Wait, this is familiar.

1261
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,400
Why horse?

1262
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,840
Still no tree.

1263
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,180
Oh, yeah.

1264
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:49,650
There we go.

1265
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:51,890
Yeah!

1266
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:55,950
Bird.

1267
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:57,650
Why horse?

1268
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,590
Okay, I'm gonna do horse.

1269
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,590
Cause I'm scared.

1270
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:07,150
Cause everybody's like, Use horse, doki!

1271
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:07,890
Use horse!

1272
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:09,790
I'm like, why?

1273
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:11,750
What's over there?

1274
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,850
Just deers.

1275
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,350
Nothing over here.

1276
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,980
Oh, I remember this area.

1277
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:27,700
Death ahead.

1278
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,700
Okay, I guess we don't go this area.

1279
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,080
Oh.

1280
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,060
Oh.

1281
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:38,680
Oh.

1282
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,340
Where...

1283
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,600
Just a big area?

1284
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,260
I feel like I've been here.

1285
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,480
Is there, like, areas I haven't explored here?

1286
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:48,960
Chat?

1287
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,440
Like, is there some place I haven't gone to yet?

1288
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,330
I've been to a lot of places.

1289
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,250
I've already explored a lot of this area.

1290
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,610
Oh, hey, there's a guy here.

1291
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:15,590
Hello.

1292
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,550
Lord of blood, your eminence.

1293
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,390
I beg you, grant me a seat at a table of destiny.

1294
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,810
Long live the Mogwen dynasty.

1295
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,090
Gorgeous view.

1296
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,150
Oh, it is pretty.

1297
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,430
That is really beautiful.

1298
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,010
He just says the same thing.

1299
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,410
Where the fuck do I go?

1300
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,210
Do I have to light this up?

1301
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:45,070
Oh, my God.

1302
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:45,730
Do I have to?

1303
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:46,370
Oh, my God.

1304
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,390
They have...

1305
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,250
Oh, my God.

1306
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:48,950
They have dogs.

1307
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:49,870
Oh, wait.

1308
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:50,430
No, they're deers.

1309
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:50,970
Oh, wait.

1310
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:51,870
They're not that threatening.

1311
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,590
Do I have to, like, light those up, chat?

1312
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,350
Can he seize me?

1313
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,050
Or is he just playing music?

1314
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:14,370
Oh, my God.

1315
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:16,430
Oh, my God.

1316
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,070
I forgot how strong these guys are.

1317
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:18,810
But it's okay.

1318
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:21,630
Oh, that's right.

1319
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,110
Invincible iframes, bitch.

1320
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:23,810
Oh, shit.

1321
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:24,810
Oh, shit.

1322
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,310
Oh, he doesn't care.

1323
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:31,130
Okay, maybe I should...

1324
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:31,670
Oh, my God.

1325
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,870
No, no, no!

1326
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:33,770
No!

1327
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,070
I had my mana potions out!

1328
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:40,910
No!

1329
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,150
I accidentally had my mana potions out.

1330
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:49,370
Oh!

1331
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,250
I...

1332
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,150
Oh, my God.

1333
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,090
Not the mana potions.

1334
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,830
God damn it.

1335
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,210
Okay, that was awkward.

1336
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,100
I can't believe, like, I didn't even get to, like...

1337
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,040
Where I actually had to...

1338
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,680
Oh, my God.

1339
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,320
That's fine.

1340
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,180
Let me light this up.

1341
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,640
Okay.

1342
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:32,820
Let's leave.

1343
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,480
Okay.

1344
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:40,740
Okay.

1345
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,320
I'm trying to, like, figure out where to go.

1346
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:47,760
Can I kill her?

1347
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,130
No more music.

1348
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,720
No more music for you!

1349
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,960
That's right!

1350
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,520
That's right!

1351
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,440
Oh, shit!

1352
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,580
That's right!

1353
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,360
I hate music!

1354
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:10,900
I'm like, oh!

1355
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,220
I...

1356
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:14,900
My God!

1357
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,020
She's so strong!

1358
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,440
Giant woman.

1359
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,460
She, like, pimp slapped me.

1360
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,120
Holy shit!

1361
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,560
Oh, my God.

1362
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,020
Her friends...

1363
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,620
She's like, how dare you hit my Oshi!

1364
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,130
That's right.

1365
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,050
Your Oshi graduated.

1366
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,170
That's right!

1367
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:41,550
See ya!

1368
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:45,650
Wait.

1369
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,090
Bye!

1370
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,170
Oh, fuck.

1371
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:57,190
There's another one here.

1372
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,740
Oh, shit.

1373
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,540
What the fuck?

1374
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,540
Alright.

1375
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,580
No sentries.

1376
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:18,980
Okay.

1377
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,280
Okay.

1378
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,020
There's a fire, right?

1379
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:20,280
Okay.

1380
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,100
I can just go behind.

1381
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:21,660
That's fine.

1382
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:25,760
Fine.

1383
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,800
I'll just do a...

1384
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,700
I'll just do a drive-by.

1385
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,200
Bye.

1386
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,480
Bye.

1387
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:36,960
That works.

1388
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,320
How many are there?

1389
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:44,400
How many flames do I have to get?

1390
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,360
Hey, guys.

1391
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,620
Guys, how many are there, anyway?

1392
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,640
For this puzzle?

1393
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,120
Six?!

1394
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,920
Jesus Christ.

1395
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:54,620
Okay, we got three.

1396
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,640
We got three, though.

1397
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:58,980
Okay.

1398
01:01:59,480 --> 01:01:59,980
Three more.

1399
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,920
Gotta figure out where the last three are.

1400
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,420
Alright.

1401
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,600
We got that.

1402
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,020
We got this one here.

1403
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,060
Oh my god.

1404
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,300
This wasn't even the lava fucking puzzle.

1405
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,520
I'm so sad.

1406
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,780
I don't even know how...

1407
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:22,260
I don't even know how to do this god damn stupid lava puzzle.

1408
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:31,020
Alright.

1409
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,060
We gotta find two more.

1410
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,360
Wish I knew where the lava puzzle was.

1411
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,440
Oh, wait.

1412
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:48,900
One more?

1413
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:49,860
Oh, okay.

1414
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,740
Oh, it's right here.

1415
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,320
Oh!

1416
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,420
Oh my god.

1417
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,360
I thought I could iframe that.

1418
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,880
I thought I could iframe it.

1419
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:00,860
I...

1420
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:02,820
Now I can.

1421
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:08,860
Now I can.

1422
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:09,440
That's right!

1423
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,320
Double iframe!

1424
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:10,580
Oh!

1425
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:15,540
Okay.

1426
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,440
We did it.

1427
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,680
We got the double iframe too.

1428
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:22,540
Okay.

1429
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,320
Oh my god.

1430
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,100
Oh my god.

1431
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,280
He came for me!

1432
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,780
Oh my god!

1433
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,020
That's okay.

1434
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,640
Oh, it's not okay.

1435
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:33,900
It's okay.

1436
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,580
I don't think he knows I'm here.

1437
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,760
I think he got tired.

1438
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,720
Oh my god.

1439
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,580
Guys, I don't think he knew I was behind.

1440
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:45,680
Guys, I don't think he knew I was behind.

1441
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,240
If...

1442
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,220
If...

1443
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,160
If...

1444
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,200
If...

1445
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,400
If he went home...

1446
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,580
He got tired.

1447
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,860
Then that's fine with me.

1448
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,820
I'm okay with that.

1449
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,240
No object from an instinct, guys.

1450
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,680
Okay, where do I go with these?

1451
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,060
Alright.

1452
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,640
We go up here?

1453
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:24,790
Is it that?

1454
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:28,450
No, that's where everybody... No, that's where I'd sneak in.

1455
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,190
Place with the torches?

1456
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,410
Hey, that's my jellyfish.

1457
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:34,730
Wait, you're still alive?

1458
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:41,790
Oh wait, no, this is like... That's where all the wild jellyfishes are.

1459
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:47,870
Oh my god, that's where I kidnapped my child.

1460
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:55,420
Okay.

1461
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,500
Yeah, but I wanna grab this item.

1462
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,280
Alright.

1463
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,360
That's where I kidnapped her.

1464
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,060
Oh, it's here.

1465
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,800
Oh my god, it's another one of these fucking deers?

1466
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,020
Oh my god, it's Spirit Away, the sequel.

1467
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,060
Where's the Grace, though?

1468
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,080
Apparently, is there Grace nearby?

1469
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:30,130
How the fuck is the other Grace?

1470
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,660
I'm gonna finish the job.

1471
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:40,940
I killed Bambi's mom.

1472
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,800
I'm gonna kill Bambi's dad now.

1473
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:47,870
It's South?

1474
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:48,530
Okay.

1475
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:52,840
Let's figure this out.

1476
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,880
Oh, this is not here.

1477
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,140
Is it South or West, guys?

1478
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,500
Is it here?

1479
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,230
Near the wolves?

1480
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,800
South, West?

1481
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:22,560
Here?

1482
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:22,620
Where?

1483
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,180
Nothing here.

1484
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:33,870
Oh, there's an item here.

1485
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:36,410
Nets.

1486
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:37,390
Item.

1487
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,210
Somewhere here.

1488
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:43,650
Yeah, we need this, actually.

1489
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,290
Okay, it's not here.

1490
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:53,850
Wait, were these wolves chasing me?

1491
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:55,650
They're like, Boss, we couldn't get him!

1492
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:57,050
He was too fast!

1493
01:06:58,550 --> 01:06:59,530
Okay, it's the other way.

1494
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:04,970
Oh, there it is.

1495
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:09,410
Oh.

1496
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,430
Alright, let's get this.

1497
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:18,480
Secret tier?

1498
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:18,560
There?

1499
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,760
Okay.

1500
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:25,030
I feel like...

1501
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:26,850
I feel like that's a bait.

1502
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,430
That feels so fucking bait-y.

1503
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:37,170
Alright, let's go for...

1504
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,430
Let's go for the deer.

1505
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,010
Alright.

1506
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,930
Killing the deer.

1507
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:52,210
The sequel.

1508
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,090
Electric tube boogaloo.

1509
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:55,790
Alright, here I am.

1510
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:56,990
Alright.

1511
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,530
Time to kill you again!

1512
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,090
I killed your wife!

1513
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:05,070
I'm back at it again!

1514
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,030
Only messages here?

1515
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:08,750
Oh, I can.

1516
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,390
Alright, let's see.

1517
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,220
I did it.

1518
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,620
That's right.

1519
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,920
I'm already congratulating future Doki.

1520
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,680
You go, future Doki.

1521
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,140
You fucking did it!

1522
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,620
How is this deer gonna do?

1523
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,960
Fucking die like his...

1524
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,780
Like his wife?

1525
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,360
Look at that.

1526
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,100
Look at him.

1527
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,280
He barely does nothing!

1528
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,700
Okay, I need to not lock in for this one though.

1529
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,660
This deer is at...

1530
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,280
The deer...

1531
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,640
Locking in is just not it.

1532
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,160
What?

1533
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:52,900
What he said?

1534
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,340
I bet I did it.

1535
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,580
Wait, is he just...

1536
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,080
Is he just respawning?

1537
01:08:59,020 --> 01:08:59,960
What the fuck?

1538
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:01,700
What happened?

1539
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,300
What the fuck happened?

1540
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,100
He came back to life!

1541
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,860
He's slowly walking towards me.

1542
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:16,780
Eh, loser.

1543
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:18,800
Look at him.

1544
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,780
He wanted to like get a rematch already.

1545
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,700
Stupid.

1546
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,140
He's so weak.

1547
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,560
Look at how weak you are!

1548
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,660
Look at you!

1549
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,860
Go die again!

1550
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,840
Born again.

1551
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,400
Yeah, he did a fucking...

1552
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:40,800
Born again.

1553
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:41,800
Oh my god.

1554
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:42,200
Whoa.

1555
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,100
Wait.

1556
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,520
What's going on with this guy?

1557
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:48,940
Oh my god!

1558
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,040
Wait, my jellyfish!

1559
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:50,660
Wait!

1560
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:51,780
Jellyfish!

1561
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,100
How did you lose all that HP?

1562
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,040
Jellyfish!

1563
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:57,460
Okay, that's how.

1564
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,220
That's how.

1565
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,980
Okay, that's how he did it.

1566
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,880
He lost.

1567
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,920
Okay, I understand now.

1568
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,380
I understand.

1569
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,000
Where did all the HP go, buddy?

1570
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,240
Wait, what?

1571
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,360
Evil Gear?

1572
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,560
Wait, what?

1573
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,180
What's going on?

1574
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:23,460
Wait, what?!

1575
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:28,900
My god!

1576
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,560
He rejects?!

1577
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,900
Oh my god!

1578
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,540
I needed a...

1579
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,100
Oh, that is so bullshit.

1580
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,100
Oh my god!

1581
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,200
He has appraisals too!

1582
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,820
Oh no!

1583
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,600
Wait!

1584
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,520
I got...

1585
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,450
Oh my god, this is not fair.

1586
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:58,890
Wait, he has appraisals!

1587
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:05,450
Oh my god!

1588
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:08,350
How do I kill something that can be appraisals!

1589
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:11,030
How do I kill something that can be appraised?!

1590
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:13,110
Not fair!

1591
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:17,970
No way!

1592
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,340
Oh, Jokey, it's not fair now, is it?

1593
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,900
When you're on the other side!

1594
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,920
It's not... Oh, now it's not fair!

1595
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:40,960
Oh god.

1596
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:50,860
There's only room for one content creator here, guys!

1597
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,080
Oh my god.

1598
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,340
Please don't heal again.

1599
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:57,860
Please.

1600
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,060
No, that's not fair!

1601
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,400
Oh no.

1602
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,110
Bro, he keeps dying!

1603
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,740
That message was appraised.

1604
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:29,320
Haha, tables have dirt.

1605
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,380
Wait, what?

1606
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:37,840
Okay, that was a roll.

1607
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,060
That was a roll.

1608
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,420
Bro, this guy just dodges every time, too.

1609
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,620
At least I'm not playing like a pussy!

1610
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,760
Guys!

1611
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,620
I take- NOOOOO!

1612
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,540
Okay.

1613
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:06,480
Okay, I didn't think he would do that much damage.

1614
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:10,700
I really- I didn't think so about that.

1615
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:12,880
Okay.

1616
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,040
Alright.

1617
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,000
Okay, now- Now I know what he does, guys.

1618
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:17,880
Now I know.

1619
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,240
Nice, nice, nice.

1620
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,940
Nice, Kevin.

1621
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,240
Thank you for the super chat.

1622
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,440
Thank you, thank you.

1623
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,440
Okay, now that I know.

1624
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,100
Now that I know.

1625
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:30,200
Oh.

1626
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,220
Okay, I need to grab my runes first.

1627
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,200
I know now.

1628
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,680
I know now.

1629
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,700
Oh my god, you literally just lived.

1630
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,150
Okay.

1631
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,430
Okay, I know now.

1632
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:04,250
Oh fucking hell.

1633
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:08,670
Oh my god.

1634
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:10,010
Oh my god.

1635
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:11,590
You guys- Please get poisoned.

1636
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,730
Oh, come on!

1637
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:22,310
Okay.

1638
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,270
No.

1639
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:26,330
No!

1640
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:33,670
Okay.

1641
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:35,630
Alright.

1642
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:36,710
That's fine.

1643
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:39,730
That's fine.

1644
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:42,950
Get over here.

1645
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:45,250
I'm not letting you message appraise.

1646
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:53,910
If I learn anything from my own build, I just gotta make sure you don't get message appraise.

1647
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:08,870
Gotta make sure- Don't you fucking- Don't you fucking dare get message appraise!

1648
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:11,770
That's fucker!

1649

1651
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:28,380
Okay.

1652
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,080
Oh my god, he's so- Come on.

1653
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,800
Oh shit!

1654
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,860
I didn't see my HP.

1655
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,060

1656
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,880

1658
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:53,680
It's the battle of the fucking streamers!

1659
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,440
Who has more fans?

1660
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,060
Fuck you!

1661
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,160
Who the fuck has more fans right now?

1662
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,200
The battle of the century!

1663
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,540
The message appraise.

1664
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,780
I will appraise more than you!

1665
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,540
Oh my god, I miss.

1666
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,900
Oh my god.

1667
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,920
Oh my god!

1668
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:27,960
Oh my god!

1669
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,040
Oh my god!

1670
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:30,220
Holy shit.

1671
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:31,360
Okay.

1672
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:32,420
That's fine.

1673
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:35,020
The dragoons will win!

1674
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,400
Fuck you, nature!

1675
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,500
The humans- Animals are going in danger, not dragoons!

1676
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,120
Alright, where is he?

1677
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,960
Get in there.

1678
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:50,960
Come on!

1679
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,200
Stop running away like a little bitch!

1680
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,140
Are you serious?

1681
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,380
Are you serious?

1682
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:00,500
Are you serious?

1683
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,180
Are you fucking kidding me?

1684
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,420
Oh my god, no!

1685
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,660
That's right, message appraise this!

1686
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,020
Fuck you!

1687
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,860
Our fandom won!

1688
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,360
That's right.

1689
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,020
Remember this, dragoons.

1690
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,240
We won the fandom war.

1691
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:26,180
It's like the Saja boys versus the Huntricks.

1692
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:26,840
We won!

1693
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,740
That's right!

1694
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,180
Victory chug!

1695
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:31,400
Let's go!

1696
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:36,400
Fandom of- This is why we're fandom of the year, guys!

1697
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:38,100
This is why!

1698
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,700
That's right!

1699
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:41,980
You're all gonna go in danger!

1700
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,020
You're gonna chop down all your trees now!

1701
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,340
That's right!

1702
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,180
This is Team Edward versus Jacob!

1703
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:50,420
And I won!

1704
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,780
And I won!

1705
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,000
That's right!

1706
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,340
Message appraise this!

1707
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,600
Alright!

1708
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,540
We did it!

1709
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,460
Uh...

1710
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,040
But fuck, guys!

1711
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,340
We did- This wasn't even the- God!

1712
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:17,180
The worst part is that this wasn't even the fucking- The fucking side quest too, for lava matter!

1713
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:20,780
Alright!

1714
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,740
Let's go- Oh yeah, we got it!

1715
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,460
Let's go- Wait, can I level up here?

1716
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,260
Okay, I can!

1717
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:33,800
Nice!

1718
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,300
Alright, guys!

1719
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:36,440
What do we do after- Do we still do Dexterity?

1720
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,240
What do we do after that?

1721
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:42,380
Chat!

1722
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,460
What do we do?

1723
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:53,620
What do we do?

1724
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:53,860
Arcane?

1725
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,120
Is it worth it now?

1726
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,940
Cause I know some people were like, don't do arcane yet!

1727
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:05,290
River of blood?

1728
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:07,450
Am I supposed to get the river of blood katana?

1729
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,200
Okay, it's okay to level up.

1730
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:18,260
Okay, I'll do 11 then.

1731
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,260
Alright, I'll get it later.

1732
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:21,640
Okay.

1733
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,640
Alright, let's go level up our little jellyfish.

1734
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:30,860
Nevermind.

1735
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,240
Let's not, I guess.

1736
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,640
Does that mean I shouldn't level up my katana anymore?

1737
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,060
So I can sh- Save?

1738
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:40,600
Uh...

1739
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,740
So I can save for, uh...

1740
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,860
Save up for like, level up for my other katanas?

1741
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:53,770
Okay.

1742
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,510
Alright, so like...

1743
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:58,810
I don't know what to do for this side quest.

1744
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:03,250
Like...

1745
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:05,550
The red dot is gone.

1746
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:07,130
Where do I go?

1747
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:11,770
There used to be a red mark here.

1748
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:12,470
It's gone.

1749
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:14,510
Unless I already explored it.

1750
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:18,030
I go to this one now?

1751
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,550
There used to be a red marker right here.

1752
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:22,170
But it's gone now.

1753
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:24,450
So I guess I'll go here?

1754
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:26,090
I guess I'll go there.

1755
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:31,950
There used to be a second red mark there.

1756
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:34,390
I guess it's gone now.

1757
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:36,630
This is where I met my first maiden.

1758
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:43,800
Alright.

1759
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,500
Okay, and then we go here.

1760
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,900
I need to make sure not to jump when I do that.

1761
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:05,160
Cause like, jumping apparently, like, raises my fall damage.

1762
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:14,470
Okay.

1763
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:18,190
Okay, it's somewhere here.

1764
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,420
Where is it?

1765
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,040
There?

1766
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,140
Oh, am I ready?

1767
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:31,100
Okay.

1768
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,660
Usually, no.

1769
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:34,740
Okay, I'm not.

1770
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,480
But like...

1771
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:37,600
It's fine.

1772
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,400
This one?

1773
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:46,070
Alright.

1774
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:49,800
Hello.

1775
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,500
Oh my god.

1776
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,360
I'm evil now.

1777
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:53,260
Oh, hey.

1778
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,120
Hello.

1779
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,100
I'm not...

1780
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:57,760
I'm friendly.

1781
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,200
Shit!

1782
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:02,720
Oh, shit!

1783
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,340
Oh, I forgot to go to Grace!

1784
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,480
I forgot...

1785
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,360
I forgot to get Grace!

1786
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,800
Oh, shit!

1787
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,020
Guys, guys.

1788
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:13,360
Guys, guys.

1789
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,580
We have to rely on...

1790
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,260
Oh, my god.

1791
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,820
Oh, my god.

1792
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,220
Oh, am I the invader or is he invading me at this point?

1793
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,240
Am I...

1794
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,040
Holy shit!

1795
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,250
You bitch.

1796
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:33,890
Oh.

1797
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:37,310
Oh!

1798
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:41,590
Oh, I get less heals if I invade.

1799
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:42,850
I was gonna say, wasn't I...

1800
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,610
I thought I had Grace!

1801
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:47,390
Like...

1802
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:52,510
Okay.

1803
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:52,530
Okay.

1804
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:55,530
Jesus Christ.

1805
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,090
Oh, my god.

1806
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,630
This guy does so much.

1807
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:04,210
Okay.

1808
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:04,690
That's...

1809
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:06,090
At least I know I'm faster there.

1810
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:08,990
Guys, I'm pretty fucked up.

1811
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:11,630
Wait!

1812
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:12,730
You can't hear me!

1813
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:13,830
I'm just saying!

1814
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:16,930
Oh, my god.

1815
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:18,110
Oh, my god.

1816
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:20,630
Do I get to keep my Grace at least?

1817
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:22,850
I died.

1818
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:29,650
Okay.

1819
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:32,590
Okay.

1820
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:33,450
Okay.

1821
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:33,610
We...

1822
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:34,430
Okay, now I know.

1823
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:35,870
Okay, I gotta get my shit back.

1824
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,290
My one build...

1825
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:40,810
No!

1826
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:42,670
He took away my...

1827
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,990
Wait, where's my...

1828
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,490
Wait, where's my shit?

1829
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,270
Wait, where's my Grace?

1830
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:52,850
Wait!

1831
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,750
He took my Grace!

1832
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,900
Oh, I didn't lose them?

1833
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:03,800
Thank god.

1834
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,080
Oh, thank god.

1835
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:05,880
I thought I lost him.

1836
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,360
Okay.

1837
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:11,760
Good to know.

1838
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:14,560
Alright.

1839
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,200
Fucker.

1840
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,520
Oh, my god.

1841
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:29,100
It's not fair.

1842
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,220
You have...

1843
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:30,960
You have...

1844
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,000
Grass by your side.

1845
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:33,880
Guys.

1846
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,400
Guys.

1847
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:35,500
Guys.

1848
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,180
I thought you said this guy was easy.

1849
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,860
Oh, my god.

1850
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:42,560
I hate him.

1851
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:50,280
Okay, guys.

1852
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,420
I think I need more churches.

1853
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:51,840
Maybe.

1854
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:56,120
He is.

1855
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:57,800
Guys.

1856
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,720
I definitely need more churches.

1857
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,180
I hate him.

1858
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:04,520
I hate him.

1859
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,800
Oh, my god.

1860
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,740
My appraisal heals does more heals.

1861
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,800
My appraisal heals does more heals.

1862
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:13,880
That's...

1863
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,800
My flask!

1864
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,580
It's so fucked up!

1865
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:17,600
Okay, guys.

1866
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,280
We gotta find churches after this.

1867
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,020
We gotta find...

1868
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,740
We gotta find churches after this!

1869
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:29,260
Okay.

1870
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:29,600
Okay.

1871
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:29,640
Alright.

1872
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:30,700
Let's go find a church.

1873
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,560
Let's see.

1874
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,880
I need religion.

1875
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,020
Oh, my god.

1876
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,140
The fact that my appraisal does more healing than my fucking flask.

1877
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,280
That's so awkward.

1878
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:53,060
Wait.

1879
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,340
My grace is gone.

1880
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:55,100
Wait.

1881
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:55,800
My runes are...

1882
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,720
You liars!

1883
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,740
I lost my runes!

1884
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,600
You guys said I don't lose runes!

1885
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,600
You liars!

1886
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,140
Oh, is...

1887
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,440
Was it, like, outside?

1888
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:17,940
Was it, like, here?

1889
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:23,020
Oh, when I died, they leave it...

1890
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:23,760
Oh, my god.

1891
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,600
Okay, that's fine.

1892
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:33,970
Oh, I didn't realize they were right here.

1893
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:35,170
I thought it meant I...

1894
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:37,230
Okay, where is the church near me?

1895
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:41,050
Where's the closest church, guys?

1896
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:44,610
Hey.

1897
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:45,490
No, wait.

1898
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:46,190
There's something here.

1899
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:47,710
Oh, my god.

1900
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,350
Those were my zero runes.

1901
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:50,630
Those were...

1902
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:51,730
Those were...

1903
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:52,350
Okay.

1904
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:55,450
All right.

1905
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:00,290
All right.

1906
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:01,190
Where is it?

1907
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:04,310
Go south?

1908
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:04,970
Okay.

1909
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:08,250
I just go south?

1910
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:10,170
All right.

1911
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:12,530
Okay.

1912
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:13,790
What should I get?

1913
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:16,110
How many plus flashs should I have?

1914
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,290
Guys.

1915
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:25,400
Okay.

1916
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:28,440
Wait.

1917
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,860
Is it easier if I just teleport?

1918
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,000
Can I just teleport here?

1919
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,420
Even further?

1920
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:44,080
Here?

1921
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,280
Further?

1922
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:46,840
Here?

1923
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,060
How much further can I go?

1924
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:57,900
Wait.

1925
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:58,300
Oh.

1926
01:27:58,920 --> 01:27:59,320
Here.

1927
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,500
Here?

1928
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:12,570
Oh, like here?

1929
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:18,900
Here?

1930
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:22,440
Here?

1931
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,840
We're here.

1932
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,300
That way?

1933
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:32,550
That's it.

1934
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:33,370
I'm...

1935
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:36,690
Churches in Elden Ring.

1936
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:37,870
Fuck you guys.

1937
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:38,870
We're never gonna...

1938
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:41,490
You guys are never gonna guide me to the right area.

1939
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:42,390
You guys...

1940
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,410
Fuck it.

1941
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:50,250
I don't...

1942
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,810
You guys are never gonna guide me to the right area.

1943
01:28:53,290 --> 01:28:53,470
All right.

1944
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:58,130
Okay.

1945
01:28:58,470 --> 01:28:58,930
Here.

1946
01:28:59,450 --> 01:28:59,630
Here.

1947
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:00,690
Here.

1948
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:01,510
Okay.

1949
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:01,830
Wait.

1950
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:03,350
Is it here?

1951
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:04,110
Wait.

1952
01:29:04,190 --> 01:29:05,430
Is there more to this map?

1953
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:07,350
Is there more?

1954
01:29:09,070 --> 01:29:09,770
Wait.

1955
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:10,450
Here?

1956
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:11,130
Wait.

1957
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:12,490
All the way here?

1958
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:14,950
Here?

1959
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:18,660
You are ungrateful.

1960
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:20,750
Wait.

1961
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:21,230
There's...

1962
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:21,990
Oh my god.

1963
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:22,550
Okay.

1964
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:23,610
Let's get over there.

1965
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:26,610
Okay.

1966
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,080
I didn't realize we're missing that much of the map.

1967
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:41,660
All right.

1968
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:43,000
Let's figure this out.

1969
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:49,770
Okay.

1970
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,090
Let's get rid of these two.

1971
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,050
We gotta go here.

1972
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:02,270
Wait.

1973
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:02,330
Wait.

1974
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:02,990
What number is that?

1975
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:03,310
That's two.

1976
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:04,330
Where the fuck is one?

1977
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:05,150
Oh, there's...

1978
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,270
One over here.

1979
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:08,030
The fuck is four?

1980
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:13,410
Where are my markers?

1981
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:15,450
Oh, there is one.

1982
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:15,770
Okay.

1983
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:16,190
Here we go.

1984
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:19,790
All right.

1985
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,310
Now, we should be fine.

1986
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,220
It should be, like, this way.

1987
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:33,920
I didn't realize I was missing, like, half this map.

1988
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:41,780
All right.

1989
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,060
Here we go.

1990
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,000
Oh, hey.

1991
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:47,360
There's stuff.

1992
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:47,820
Oh, hey.

1993
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:48,680
There's a merchant here.

1994
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,400
Hello.

1995
01:30:51,400 --> 01:31:11,690
Here we go.

1996
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:14,390
Oh.

1997
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:24,990
There you have me.

1998
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:27,130
Only worsens.

1999
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,330
Until the floodgates burst.

2000
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:32,410
Unleashing eternal torment.

2001
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:34,150
The strength of...

2002
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:35,450
Oh, he has a good katana?

2003
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,510
Magnificent.

2004
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:38,390
Oh, my god.

2005
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:40,050
That's the Roshi right there.

2006
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:42,210
It's no surprise that drug and communion...

2007
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,000
You must not forget the old super...

2008
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:49,220
Oh.

2009
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,540
It's a long sword.

2010
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,300
If we're trying to attack...

2011
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:54,440
Wait.

2012
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,480
Do I have to kill him?

2013
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:56,700
Is it worth it?

2014
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,260
This is like...

2015
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:08,570
Oh, you can do the quest.

2016
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:08,870
Okay.

2017
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:10,990
I was about to...

2018
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:11,890
I was like...

2019
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:12,710
Is it worth it, guys?

2020
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:14,690
Is it...

2021
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:17,150
Guys.

2022
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:20,830
I was about to do it.

2023
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:21,750
I was...

2024
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:22,610
I was this...

2025
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:26,150
I was ready.

2026
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:27,290
I was ready.

2027
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:28,430
No hesitation.

2028
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:29,170
I was like...

2029
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:29,210
Wait.

2030
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:29,730
Gear?

2031
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:30,510
Okay.

2032
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:36,310
He almost died there.

2033
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:36,630
Yeah.

2034
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:37,650
It was...

2035
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:39,310
This close to dying.

2036
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,160
She's right behind me, isn't she?

2037
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:49,880
He he.

2038
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,700
What are they all looking at?

2039
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,080
What are they all looking at there?

2040
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,580
They're scouting for stuff.

2041
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:12,550
Alright.

2042
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:13,510
I'll enter.

2043
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:18,760
What is this?

2044
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,070
What is this?

2045
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:26,170
Oh.

2046
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:28,410
Oh.

2047
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:30,410
Oh.

2048
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:32,010
Oh.

2049
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:32,570
Wait.

2050
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:33,490
Oh.

2051
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:34,230
Wait.

2052
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:35,570
I remember this guy from Night Ring.

2053
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:35,990
Oh.

2054
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:37,370
Wait a minute.

2055
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:38,770
I don't think I was supposed to be.

2056
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:42,750
I don't think I was supposed to be.

2057
01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:44,550
Oh my god.

2058
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:45,370
I actually like...

2059
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:46,310
Oh, hey.

2060
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:46,650
These...

2061
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:46,830
Oh.

2062
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:48,270
I'm so over level for this.

2063
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:49,070
I...

2064
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,120
I may or may not be over level.

2065
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:56,620
It's just maybe.

2066
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:57,760
Oh shit!

2067
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,340
If he gets bleed, maybe not!

2068
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:04,650
It's fine.

2069
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:06,310
I just wanna make sure I don't get bleed.

2070
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:06,690
Okay.

2071
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:07,190
Nevermind.

2072
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:11,390
Oh my god!

2073
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:11,790
Okay.

2074
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:12,470
Nevermind.

2075
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,680
No, please don't bleed me!

2076
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:20,140
Please!

2077
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:20,640
Please!

2078
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:21,480
Okay.

2079
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:21,980
We just gotta wait.

2080
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,760
We just gotta chill out.

2081
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:26,120
Okay.

2082
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,740
But I'm worried about the bleed though.

2083
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,520
Okay.

2084
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:35,980
It's fine.

2085
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,620
I did it.

2086
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:38,020
Yay!

2087
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,480
Message was appraised.

2088
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:42,520
Oh my god!

2089
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:44,960
This guy only gave me 1900?

2090
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,400
That was how over level I was.

2091
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,400
Holy shit!

2092
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:52,920
Okay.

2093
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,480
I was definitely not...

2094
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:58,580
I was definitely way too strong for that fight.

2095
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,320
Yeah.

2096
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:06,760
I probably could've tanked that shit.

2097
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:07,080
Nope.

2098
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,280
I probably could've.

2099
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:15,660
Uh...

2100
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:16,600
They all live here.

2101
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:18,480
Nice.

2102
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:21,940
Uh...

2103
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:22,540
For later, Doki.

2104
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,780
Go to the outskirts, Grace, and follow the road, Narve, East.

2105
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:28,380
You can find a church with sacred tear and a cool item.

2106
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,320
Thank you for the super chat!

2107
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:29,660
Thank you!

2108
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:30,300
Thank you!

2109
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,660
The fuck is that?

2110
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,440
The outskirts...

2111
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:35,000
What?

2112
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,940
I don't know where that is.

2113
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,120
What is this?

2114
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:42,560
Yeah.

2115
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,780
Can you give us a super chat thingy?

2116
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:47,320
Thank you.

2117
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:48,040
Oh my gosh.

2118
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:48,520
Okay.

2119
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,520
I don't know if I could live through that, though.

2120
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:52,060
There has to be...

2121
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:52,940
Oh, there is a parkour.

2122
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:53,460
There.

2123
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:00,940
Alright.

2124
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:06,520
Nice.

2125
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,680
I just have to get through this bridge.

2126
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:14,420
That should be easy enough.

2127
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:17,900
Shit!

2128
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,640
Okay.

2129
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:22,820
I need to...

2130
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:23,820
Kill this guy.

2131
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:25,180
Okay.

2132
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:26,760
Just in case.

2133
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:28,520
Alright, that is a key.

2134
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,420
Okay, and then...

2135
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,480
Follow this road?

2136
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:39,100
Weeping Peninsula?

2137
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:40,260
Oh, hey!

2138
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:41,300
Are you okay there?

2139
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:42,920
Hello?

2140
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,060
Is somebody there?

2141
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:45,720
That's me!

2142
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,540
Might I bend your ear for a moment, please?

2143
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,120
Here.

2144
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,300
My name is Irina.

2145
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,420
I've escaped from Castle Morn to the south.

2146
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,020
A new wife.

2147
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:54,200
A new maiden.

2148
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:56,240
I can't be sure what it is.

2149
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,180
My eyesight's been weak since birth, you see.

2150
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,700
But I swear I heard frightful howling from all over.

2151
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,060
Kofi, thank you for the super chat.

2152
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:04,400
Thank you.

2153
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:04,940
Thank you.

2154
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,540
Press Y, then X.

2155
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:08,040
Oh, shit!

2156
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:08,760
That's really helpful.

2157
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:09,460
Thank you again.

2158
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:10,840
The super chat.

2159
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,680
Okay.

2160
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:17,980
Oh, he's definitely dead, dead.

2161
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:19,060
I'm sorry, man.

2162
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:20,280
Won't live in my place?

2163
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:21,920
Because you're...

2164
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,760
You're technically an orphan now?

2165
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,120
Oh, I'll take care of you.

2166
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:28,240
Oh, there's the grace.

2167
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,220
There she...

2168
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:30,780
There it is.

2169
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:33,820
Alright.

2170
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,100
We gotta figure out where...

2171
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:37,200
Where...

2172
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,300
To get this church.

2173
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,200
No, guys.

2174
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,200
Her dad's dead.

2175
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,300
We don't need to find...

2176
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:44,880
Her dad.

2177
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:45,880
He's dead.

2178
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,300
Oh, she has a quest so I keep talking to her?

2179
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,040
I...

2180
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,300
I fear for father's loss.

2181
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,640
The servants are full wrath.

2182
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,540
Filled with hatred for every one of us.

2183
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,860
They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with.

2184
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,060
Oh, shit.

2185
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:04,980
The curse.

2186
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:07,220
I fear it's no different at Castle Morn.

2187
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,100
Please.

2188
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:09,740
I implore you.

2189
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:12,240
Would you mind taking a letter to my father?

2190
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:13,560
At the castle.

2191
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,640
My soul wishes that he escape.

2192
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:18,200
Even if his honor should be the price.

2193
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:19,080
Please.

2194
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,800
I just want him to be safe.

2195
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:24,000
Alright.

2196
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:24,580
Chair.

2197
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,100
Whoa!

2198
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:28,880
That's a cool head here.

2199
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:30,640
Alright.

2200
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:31,440
I got your letter.

2201
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,060
Deliver it to my father.

2202
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,640
Who remains in the castle.

2203
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:35,680
If you please.

2204
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:37,500
Okay, cool.

2205
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:39,480
Don't worry, man.

2206
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,780
I can just lie to her, right?

2207
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,120
And be like, I did it.

2208
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:47,960
How would she know?

2209
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,140
No strong foe ahead?

2210
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,160
Oh, it's that guy?

2211
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,500
What the fuck?

2212
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,220
How can she write?

2213
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:01,280
She's blind.

2214
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,180
That's fucked up.

2215
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,260
That's fucked up.

2216
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:08,120
So fucked up.

2217
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:13,900
Yeah, but I'll just come back, like, after, like, two to three business days.

2218
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,100
And be like, I delivered a letter.

2219
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,520
I did it.

2220
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:21,140
Oh, wait.

2221
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:22,290
We need this after we...

2222
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:25,320
Nice.

2223
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:27,820
Alright.

2224
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:29,760
Oh, there's a map here.

2225
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,340
Actually, let's grab the map first.

2226
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:37,530
Okay, uh...

2227
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:39,670
We'll grab the map first before we go anywhere.

2228
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:44,700
Hello.

2229
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,440
I'm here for the map.

2230
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:47,340
Map time!

2231
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,340
Map time, map time.

2232
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,600
Map time, map time.

2233
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:53,620
Here's the map.

2234
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,620
Fa-ba-da-da-dum.

2235
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:57,040
Nice.

2236
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:58,700
Do you know where...

2237
01:39:58,700 --> 01:39:58,960
Whoa!

2238
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:05,150
Okay, that guy's not a fan.

2239
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:09,450
Anyway, do you...

2240
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:10,890
Do you know where the...

2241
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:11,330
Oh my God.

2242
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:12,470
I can't even open the map.

2243
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:14,590
The fuck is the next church?

2244
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,200
I was trying to get the map!

2245
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:25,330
What is this?

2246
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:26,410
Oh, nice.

2247
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,700
What's that even coming from?

2248
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:38,900
Oh, that's where he was coming from.

2249
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,220
Holy fuck.

2250
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:43,120
I was like, who's shooting that?

2251
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,160
Oh, there he is.

2252
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,120
Oh.

2253
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,540
Oh.

2254
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:55,990
Okay, I can't Skyrim this.

2255
01:40:57,890 --> 01:40:58,570
Man.

2256
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:01,250
Can't Skyrim, so I kill.

2257
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:05,780
Alright.

2258
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:08,920
Up this way.

2259
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,740
You know they gave Jeff Jordans?

2260
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:16,860
That's, like, great.

2261
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:21,680
There's a new Jeff emote in Marvel Rivals and they gave him some Jordans.

2262
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:27,800
We don't need Grace.

2263
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:29,740
We just need to find a stupid church.

2264
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,140
Oh, wait.

2265
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:36,480
Item.

2266
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,200
Oh my god.

2267
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,340
It's a rat... rat bush.

2268
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:50,880
The fuck is this church?

2269
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:53,460
I'm here to have my sins forgiven.

2270
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:55,900
Ignore it?

2271
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:56,380
Okay.

2272
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,320
Ah.

2273
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,560
Down here?

2274
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,300
Oh, I found a new map.

2275
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,660
What looks like a church?

2276
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:18,860
Oh my...

2277
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:23,080
I don't even know what looks like a church here.

2278
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,080
Go west.

2279
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,240
On the other side?

2280
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:30,320
What?

2281
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:32,360
Oh my god.

2282
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:32,960
There's a bridge.

2283
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:44,700
Like... here?

2284
01:42:50,890 --> 01:42:53,210
Look for building shaped spots.

2285
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:54,970
Isn't this a church?

2286
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:01,570
No, it's not, right?

2287
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:03,310
I can't tell.

2288
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:07,680
Oh.

2289
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:13,890
What the fuck?

2290
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:14,410
What?

2291
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:15,270
Is this a church too?

2292
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:25,580
Oh.

2293
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:26,160
Okay.

2294
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,100
Oh hey, I found a grace.

2295
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:36,320
Okay, fuck that.

2296
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,560
I'm pulling up this map.

2297
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:41,560
Wait, no.

2298
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:42,940
There is a church somewhere here.

2299
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:44,540
It's what?

2300
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:45,980
Church...

2301
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,340
Kalu Baptismal Church?

2302
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:50,000
Where the fuck is that?

2303
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,120
Guys!

2304
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,960
There was a church right here!

2305
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,600
Oh my god.

2306
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:02,660
No, it says Kalu Baptismal Church.

2307
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,360
It's like somewhere here.

2308
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:09,440
Oh my...

2309
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,360
What the fuck is this?

2310
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:11,900
What the fuck is that?

2311
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:12,420
Guys!

2312
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:13,540
What the...

2313
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:15,680
You're trying to take me to like Nadia.

2314
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:17,180
There's a church right there.

2315
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:17,960
Oh!

2316
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,100
Oh yeah, I forgot.

2317
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:25,880
Fucking West bullshit.

2318
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:30,220
Oh yeah!

2319
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:36,140
Okay.

2320
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:39,160
Let's head over to the other church.

2321
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,400
I should make this, right?

2322
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:43,480
I don't know.

2323
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:44,660
There's a lot of depth here.

2324
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:45,760
I don't feel like I could.

2325
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:48,060
Can I make this?

2326
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:51,800
There's a lot of people dying here.

2327
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:53,820
Let me be here.

2328
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,720
Okay, yeah I can.

2329
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:01,570
Hello.

2330
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:02,710
Goodbye.

2331
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:04,450
Can I do a flip?

2332
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:08,570
Alright.

2333
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:11,010
Let's get it all the way up there.

2334
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:11,670
Okay.

2335
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:17,810
Alright.

2336
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:19,030
And then...

2337
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:21,710
Then we'll have...

2338
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:24,710
Then we should have enough for an upgrade.

2339
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:32,010
Alright.

2340
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:33,630
Come on, churchy.

2341
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:37,110
We gotta have more than plus two.

2342
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:40,470
Because we are not surviving the invasion.

2343
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:46,130
Alright, nice.

2344
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:47,910
Oh, and there's a grace here too.

2345
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:48,330
Nice.

2346
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:51,430
I think I have...

2347
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:53,850
I think I'm pretty sure I already have.

2348
01:45:55,890 --> 01:45:56,790
Yeah, I knew it.

2349
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:58,470
Yeah.

2350
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,340
Yeah, I knew it.

2351
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:06,300
I was sure I had enough right now.

2352
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,300
Wait, what is that?

2353
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,260
Oh, it's my thing.

2354
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:13,600
Okay.

2355
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,560
And then one more church is like...

2356
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:16,220
Here.

2357
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:17,800
Right?

2358
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:19,060
That's the church, right?

2359
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,440
Yeah, that's the last church.

2360
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:29,410
Guys, I pulled up the Google Maps.

2361
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:32,130
Siri!

2362
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:34,070
Where are all the churches?

2363
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:36,030
I have committed too much sin.

2364
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:40,430
Why is there a two?

2365
01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:42,250
Oh.

2366
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:44,750
Thank God.

2367
01:46:45,090 --> 01:46:46,150
For Google Maps.

2368
01:46:49,630 --> 01:46:50,150
Alright.

2369
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:55,430
We just gotta head that way.

2370
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:56,890
Wait, there's a turtle up there.

2371
01:46:57,070 --> 01:46:57,670
What the fuck?

2372
01:46:57,810 --> 01:46:58,310
What's that?

2373
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:02,510
Okay, that looks like a fucking...

2374
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:05,030
A moving island.

2375
01:47:05,330 --> 01:47:05,990
Right there.

2376
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:10,570
That giant turtle?

2377
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:17,130
Yeah, that looks like a fucking...

2378
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:17,970
Turtle house.

2379
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:19,190
Like, you know like the...

2380
01:47:19,190 --> 01:47:21,730
The old wives' tale with the...

2381
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:22,910
Um...

2382
01:47:22,910 --> 01:47:23,450
What was it?

2383
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:25,590
The...

2384
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:26,590
The Russian witch?

2385
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:27,930
What was her name?

2386
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:32,940
There you go.

2387
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:36,000
Yeah, the Russian witch that lives in the...

2388
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,220
The house with chicken legs.

2389
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,220
Yeah, Baba Yaga.

2390
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:40,680
That shit looks like Baba Yaga over there.

2391
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,000
Don't say her name!

2392
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:48,280
Alright, nice.

2393
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:51,780
Alright, well now we're plus four.

2394
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:56,500
What's going on there?

2395
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:57,480
Is she looking at me?

2396
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:05,260
Oh, look at that.

2397
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,680
Is that a boss?

2398
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,940
Oh, if I kill her, can I like explore that house?

2399
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:18,230
Alright, we got all the churches here.

2400
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:21,690
What other church are we missing now?

2401
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:27,300
Sorta?

2402
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:30,880
Oh, it won't hurt me?

2403
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:33,160
I'm gonna hurt these guys.

2404
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:35,840
Heh heh heh heh heh.

2405
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:38,460
Heh heh heh heh.

2406
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:39,780
That's right, you're so weak.

2407
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:44,900
Oh shit!

2408
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:48,000
Alright, let's get over.

2409
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:49,380
And say hi.

2410
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,660
They had no head.

2411
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,940
I had to get rid of them.

2412
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:54,500
For the sake of humanity.

2413
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,060
What can I...

2414
01:48:58,060 --> 01:48:59,200
How do I get in?

2415
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,860
Let me in!

2416
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:11,980
Let me in!

2417
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,700
There's barnacles on his feet.

2418
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:15,580
Let me in!

2419
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:17,980
Oh!

2420
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,860
I see it.

2421
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:22,300
Oh, I see it.

2422
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:23,400
Wait, those aren't barnacles.

2423
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,120
They're fucking human skulls.

2424
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:26,760
What the fuck?

2425
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:30,260
How many fucking humans have you crushed?

2426
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:34,900
Ew.

2427
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,120
That was easy.

2428
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,000
Okay.

2429
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:40,820
Oh my god.

2430
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:42,920
Okay.

2431
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,640
That was not easy.

2432
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:46,180
The skull barnacles.

2433
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,200
Okay.

2434
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:59,240
We're almost done.

2435
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:00,940
What the fuck?

2436
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:01,400
Okay.

2437
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:03,460
I don't know how the fuck that other foot got here.

2438
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,940
I have a feeling this is not important too.

2439
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:11,260
Okay.

2440
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:12,800
I think that's all of the skull barnacles.

2441
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,240
At this period.

2442
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:16,240
Oh, I did it!

2443
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:18,860
Wait, is he happy now?

2444
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:25,380
What?!

2445
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:27,480
Oh, I thought he was gonna crush me.

2446
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:29,540
Oh, he's happy.

2447
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:31,400
This is a filler episode.

2448
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,300
We're in a filler episode right now.

2449
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:38,620
Alright.

2450
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:39,420
Get up there.

2451
01:50:45,590 --> 01:50:46,750
Oh, it's over here.

2452
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:54,120
Alright.

2453
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:54,860
Hello.

2454
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:03,590
Oh.

2455
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:07,310
Oh, so it was useless.

2456
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:10,410
The fuck am I gonna do with this?

2457
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,060
What do I do?

2458
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,240
Oh.

2459
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:23,040
Oh, I could eat a...

2460
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,220
Oh, I could eat the souls!

2461
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:24,960
You're right!

2462
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:26,120
Wait.

2463
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:27,820
Should I do like...

2464
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,560
Should I do his?

2465
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,060
And then I eat the other souls?

2466
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,560
Yeah, I could just get free souls.

2467
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:38,520
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

2468
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:39,380
Yum,

2469
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:43,700
yum, yum, yum, yum.

2470
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:46,780
Yeah, but I'm gonna use katana.

2471
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:47,940
None of them have katana.

2472
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,600
Oh, save for later?

2473
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:52,060
Okay.

2474
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:53,420
I'll be back, little guy.

2475
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:56,140
I'll be back.

2476
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:59,760
Yeah, but do the boss weapons have katanas though?

2477
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:01,280
Wait.

2478
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,020
Is there loot?

2479
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:06,620
Yeah, if I'm not gonna use the boss weapons...

2480
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:07,040
Yum, yum, yum.

2481
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,460
It's like that guy...

2482
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:11,160
Like that gif of that guy that just steals...

2483
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,140
That doing something and stuffs it in his mouth.

2484
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:13,580
That's me.

2485
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:15,980
Oh, there is late game?

2486
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:16,580
Oh.

2487
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:17,600
Okay.

2488
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:20,540
Why is it a strong katana?

2489
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:23,620
That's the question.

2490
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,320
Alright, I think I'm ready now.

2491
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,640
Alright, it's time to do this again.

2492
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:37,680
Okay.

2493
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:38,780
We're trying...

2494
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:39,580
We're doing this again.

2495
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:50,360
If the most difficult boss in the game gives you a mid katana...

2496
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:52,740
Guys, you're not really selling this to me.

2497
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:54,400
I might go...

2498
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:55,700
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

2499
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:56,120
Guys.

2500
01:53:05,290 --> 01:53:05,730
Okay.

2501
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:10,010
It's like here.

2502
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:12,630
You're making this more...

2503
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:13,710
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

2504
01:53:13,830 --> 01:53:13,950
Time.

2505
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:16,330
Alright.

2506
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:18,010
He's gonna fuck me up again.

2507
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:18,830
But like...

2508
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:20,490
I'll try one more time.

2509
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:33,950
Okay.

2510
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:40,170
Oh my god.

2511
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:46,500
Oh my god.

2512
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:47,780
Oh my god.

2513
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:49,560
Okay.

2514
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:53,860
I know I can get like...

2515
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:54,940
At least one down there.

2516
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:56,140
Oh my god.

2517
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:56,480
Okay.

2518
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:57,240
Never...

2519
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:57,680
Wow.

2520
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:00,740
Oh shit.

2521
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:03,160
Oh my god.

2522
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:04,400
Okay.

2523
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:11,240
Jesus.

2524
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:12,720
I'm trying to lock in.

2525
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:17,620
Stupid.

2526
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:18,420
Oh my god.

2527
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,760
He has iframes too.

2528
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:26,650
Fucker.

2529
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:38,210
Holy shit.

2530
01:54:41,070 --> 01:54:42,210
It's not fair.

2531
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:43,750
He's also spamming.

2532
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:48,430
Only I should be allowed.

2533
01:54:51,330 --> 01:54:52,130
Oh fuck.

2534
01:54:57,660 --> 01:54:58,120
Okay.

2535
01:54:58,380 --> 01:54:59,540
I know he did that.

2536
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:01,480
Oh my god.

2537
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:02,120
He's faster.

2538
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:02,740
It's not fair.

2539
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:03,820
It's not fair.

2540
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:05,260
He's so much faster than me.

2541
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:06,720
He's so much faster.

2542
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:08,200
It's not fair.

2543
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,300
It's not fair.

2544
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:11,360
You're so fast!

2545
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:11,520
Yes!

2546
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,040
Ah!

2547
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:19,180
Okay, I'm dead.

2548
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:23,040
Oh...

2549
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:28,560
Okay.

2550
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:29,920
I need to like know his pattern.

2551
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:36,820
Okay, but like, not yet.

2552
01:55:44,090 --> 01:55:46,790
Okay, I sort of figured it out.

2553
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:47,290
Maybe.

2554
01:55:48,830 --> 01:55:51,090
I didn't know his pattern, guys.

2555
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:52,870
I didn't know.

2556
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:57,830
Okay, but like, I almost figured it out.

2557
01:55:57,950 --> 01:56:00,550
Where the fuck did my roots drop?

2558
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:07,190
Why did it drop so far?

2559
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:11,170
Okay.

2560
01:56:12,230 --> 01:56:13,310
We go back.

2561
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:22,310
Our invasion doesn't count, guys.

2562
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:24,010
I died in his world.

2563
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:27,150
So it doesn't count.

2564
01:56:27,610 --> 01:56:30,890
I can't use a heavy attack for my magic stuff.

2565
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:35,610
It's like... It's like two...

2566
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:38,490
Oh my god, it's not fair.

2567
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:43,050
I was trying to do my magic, but he, like, got to me before I could.

2568
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:46,810
Okay.

2569
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:50,930
Alright.

2570
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:55,720
Alright, got it.

2571
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:03,900
I should heal up, actually.

2572
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:05,060
Same.

2573
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:10,460
I like... We both at the same thought.

2574
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:14,740
Okay.

2575
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:17,780
Okay, I am faster.

2576
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:18,940
That's good to know.

2577
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:20,680
Well, now I know.

2578
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,000
Oh my god, really?

2579
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:29,020
Oh, they split!

2580
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:30,260
Oh!

2581
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:30,780
Fuck!

2582
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:31,140
Okay.

2583
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:32,620
I got too confident.

2584
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:36,760
There we go.

2585
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:37,740
We figured it out.

2586
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:39,200
Oh!

2587
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,640
I did it.

2588
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:41,620
Look at that.

2589
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:42,820
So easy.

2590
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:44,980
The green.

2591
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,540
I saw bleed.

2592
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,540
I was like, oh my god, this is my time to shine!

2593
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:52,460
Okay, nice.

2594
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:53,740
I got his armor.

2595
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:55,800
Alright.

2596
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:56,380
Alright.

2597
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:58,500
Is this armor that I'll actually use?

2598
01:57:58,680 --> 01:57:58,880
Chat.

2599
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:02,220
Wait.

2600
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:02,780
Now what?

2601
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:04,380
I did all the red spot.

2602
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:10,130
Is it actually better than this?

2603
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:12,850
But is it better than what I have right now?

2604
01:58:12,850 --> 01:58:12,890
I don't know.

2605
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:19,980
Is it this?

2606
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:31,630
I don't have this.

2607
01:58:37,450 --> 01:58:38,970
Oh my god.

2608
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:42,560
Okay.

2609
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:44,740
Let's see if we can make this work.

2610
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:53,100
Let's see if we can make this work.

2611
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:03,340
Keep up the helmet?

2612
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:03,820
Okay.

2613
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:06,660
Alright.

2614
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,840
We keep the helmet and then we'll...

2615
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:15,800
Is this fat a rose or a normal rose?

2616
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:16,420
I can't tell.

2617
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:23,390
I dropped the bow, but the bow has been so good to me.

2618
01:59:26,930 --> 01:59:27,910
Okay, that's normal.

2619
01:59:28,490 --> 01:59:28,830
Okay, that's normal.

2620
01:59:28,830 --> 01:59:29,330
Okay, what if...

2621
01:59:29,330 --> 01:59:30,110
Okay, what can I...

2622
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:36,730
Oh yeah, that's definitely fat rose.

2623
01:59:37,310 --> 01:59:39,090
Wait, did I have like light rose earlier?

2624
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,120
Did I have light rose earlier?

2625
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:48,240
Or was it...

2626
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:49,160
Oh, I had medium.

2627
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:51,280
Oh yeah, I just had normal.

2628
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:51,600
Okay.

2629
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:52,460
I couldn't tell.

2630
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:54,840
Okay, then I can put my arrows back then.

2631
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:58,500
Alright, I killed him.

2632
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:00,620
Did you read the letter left for you?

2633
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:04,660
That is the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.

2634
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:06,260
You will be called...

2635
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:06,960
Elden bling.

2636
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,000
Skysike, thank you for the...

2637
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,120
Uh, super chat, thank you, thank you.

2638
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,440
If you are loathed to hunt your own kin, so be it.

2639
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:15,800
But you must leave this house at once.

2640
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:18,480
This is a war against the Erdtree.

2641
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:20,680
We have no place for the meek.

2642
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:22,900
Nor the luxury of keeping...

2643
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:23,940
But I already did it.

2644
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:24,840
I killed him.

2645
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:27,380
Oh my god, I forgot that one.

2646
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:30,620
I forgot that was my face.

2647
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,880
You've completed your task.

2648
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:40,420
I am pleased.

2649
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,000
Yeah, look at me.

2650
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:42,000
Yeah, I did.

2651
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:43,540
You are a recusant truth.

2652
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:44,320
That's you guys.

2653
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:45,460
There it goes, that's you.

2654
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:47,020
I am a member of the Volcano Manor.

2655
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:48,880
This is your reward.

2656
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:50,280
As promised.

2657
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:53,220
Hey, I got magma shot.

2658
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:57,820
Never forget that the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion.

2659
02:00:58,240 --> 02:00:59,840
The way is tainted.

2660
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:04,100
But for this very reason, it is the true path.

2661
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:05,540
Is she working for the devil now?

2662
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,680
Kevin, thank you for the super chat.

2663
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:08,560
Thank you.

2664
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:09,480
Now you are a recusant truth.

2665
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:12,960
And a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.

2666
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:14,460
I am pleased.

2667
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:16,420
To have you on our side.

2668
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:20,180
Put the helmet back on, bro.

2669
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:20,860
Wait, I already did.

2670
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:23,120
Wait, do I not have another mission?

2671
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,780
Is that it?

2672
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:27,240
That's it?

2673
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:30,640
Oh, is there another?

2674
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:31,660
Oh, there is.

2675
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:33,900
Wait, no, there isn't.

2676
02:01:43,190 --> 02:01:44,250
Where's that table?

2677
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:51,840
Oh, it's in a different room.

2678
02:01:56,610 --> 02:01:57,870
Oh, is it in this room?

2679
02:02:01,900 --> 02:02:02,980
Oh, that guy?

2680
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:05,140
What, Alexa said no to?

2681
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,160
Oh, there it is.

2682
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:07,880
Alright.

2683
02:02:14,030 --> 02:02:16,270
Uh, at the Atlas Plateau.

2684
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:16,730
Okay.

2685
02:02:19,030 --> 02:02:19,850
What the fuck?

2686
02:02:20,050 --> 02:02:20,350
Where's that?

2687
02:02:21,390 --> 02:02:22,550
What the fuck is that?

2688
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:24,610
Guys, we need to find this map.

2689
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:26,430
Okay, let's find this map first.

2690
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:32,210
Alright.

2691
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:38,520
I need to get the map for this.

2692
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:41,160
I need to figure out where the fuck I am.

2693
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:46,680
What the fuck is that guy here?

2694
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,140
Can I, like, backstab him?

2695
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:56,040
Guys, I shouldn't have engaged.

2696
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:57,060
I shouldn't have engaged.

2697
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:58,600
Oh my god.

2698
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:00,660
I don't know why I engaged in him.

2699
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,500
Oh my god.

2700
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:03,660
Oh my god.

2701
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:04,140
Get me out of here.

2702
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:05,060
Get me out of here.

2703
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,040
Wait, that's just a cliff.

2704
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:16,880
Oh my god, they fucking killed so many of the other giants.

2705
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:22,060
What the fuck?

2706
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:23,280
What's that over there?

2707
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:26,320
What is that?

2708
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:31,440
What is that?

2709
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:35,080
What is that?

2710
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:40,320
What?

2711
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:44,680
Okay, fuck this.

2712
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:45,340
I'm...

2713
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:46,980
Give me this.

2714
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:49,720
And then, let me try and find the...

2715
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,560
Fuck that shit.

2716
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:03,830
I gotta do this.

2717
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:06,430
Wait, I have a heavy attack on the horse?

2718
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:07,870
Whoops.

2719
02:04:10,730 --> 02:04:11,290
Whoops.

2720
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:17,130
Oh my god, not the fingers.

2721
02:04:19,870 --> 02:04:21,250
Alright, Matt found.

2722
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:26,340
Grace found.

2723
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,160
Because I'm still learning.

2724
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:33,920
No one told her?

2725
02:04:38,150 --> 02:04:40,390
Okay, now we have plus five.

2726
02:04:41,870 --> 02:04:43,830
Okay, now we gotta figure out...

2727
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:45,710
Where the fuck is that?

2728
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:47,310
Wait, there's a red here.

2729
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:52,400
Where the fuck do I get here?

2730
02:04:55,180 --> 02:04:56,660
Did I get here from the cave?

2731
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:06,060
What the fuck do I get there?

2732
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:07,980
Did I get there from this cave?

2733
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,020
Oh my god, where's the exit?

2734
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,270
What the fuck do I get there?

2735
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:24,870
Oh, there's the exit.

2736
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:24,910
Oh, there's the exit.

2737
02:05:25,110 --> 02:05:25,250
Okay.

2738
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:35,080
Can I?

2739
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:37,260
The ruins?

2740
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:41,950
Here?

2741
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:51,140
Guys, this is a whole filler episode.

2742
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:52,300
We're never gonna...

2743
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:56,540
We're actually on our filler episode.

2744
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:03,580
Alright.

2745
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:08,690
We gotta go this way.

2746
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:11,430
The tree?

2747
02:06:11,810 --> 02:06:12,670
This side?

2748
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:16,830
Go to that giant ass tree?

2749
02:06:17,290 --> 02:06:18,510
Or run to this mark?

2750
02:06:18,670 --> 02:06:19,410
I'm just gonna run here.

2751
02:06:20,710 --> 02:06:21,330
Or what?

2752
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:22,390
Can I get it from here?

2753
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:27,400
Alright.

2754
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,440
Oh, we'll just go straight.

2755
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:43,160
That seems like a bad guy.

2756
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:44,980
Yep.

2757
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:47,620
What's over there?

2758
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:49,440
Wait, there's a dungeon here.

2759
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:53,320
Okay, we're having a filler episode.

2760
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:54,380
We'll be in our filler episode.

2761
02:07:04,230 --> 02:07:04,750
Alright.

2762
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:10,580
Oh, nice.

2763
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:16,740
A filler episode in the filler episode.

2764
02:07:17,540 --> 02:07:18,860
Wait, what the fuck?

2765
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:19,980
Wait, I could've jumped off there.

2766
02:07:32,190 --> 02:07:33,270
Alright, what's this?

2767
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:35,130
Cracked crystal?

2768
02:07:38,450 --> 02:07:38,830
I don't know.

2769
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:39,930
A lot of cracked crystals here.

2770
02:07:40,430 --> 02:07:41,210
Oh, shit.

2771
02:07:41,430 --> 02:07:42,170
Wait, I have piercing.

2772
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:49,500
What's he trying to do?

2773
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:51,340
Oh, he's trying to light the dynamite?

2774
02:07:56,570 --> 02:07:58,330
Why fuck do I do a cracked crystal?

2775
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:07,480
I mean, they seem to be friendly so far.

2776
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:10,980
Tear the head?

2777
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:12,420
Oh, nice.

2778
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:19,160
I'm scared.

2779
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:20,200
I'm scared.

2780
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,680
There's dynamite next to me.

2781
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:22,480
I'm scared.

2782
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:26,100
Oh my god.

2783
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:26,700
That's one.

2784
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:28,000
There's dynamite next to me.

2785
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:28,560
I'm scared.

2786
02:08:34,110 --> 02:08:34,550
I'm scared.

2787
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:35,750
He followed me?!

2788
02:08:42,170 --> 02:08:44,530
Guys, I don't like this filler episode anymore.

2789
02:08:47,370 --> 02:08:48,530
Guys, I'm gonna leave.

2790
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:50,370
I don't like this filler episode.

2791
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:53,170
I'll come back later.

2792
02:08:53,370 --> 02:08:53,750
I'll come back later.

2793
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:54,710
Guys, I'll come back later.

2794
02:08:54,910 --> 02:08:55,550
Just...

2795
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:56,790
Not the right time.

2796
02:08:57,790 --> 02:08:58,470
Not...

2797
02:08:58,470 --> 02:09:02,150
This game is very scary.

2798
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:03,770
We'll be back.

2799
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:09,670
Wait, there's something here.

2800
02:09:10,430 --> 02:09:11,330
Let's see here.

2801
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:14,590
Are you serious?

2802
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:16,210
Oh, wait.

2803
02:09:16,350 --> 02:09:16,730
I can...

2804
02:09:16,730 --> 02:09:17,790
Wait, I can fix this.

2805
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:19,630
Oh.

2806
02:09:21,290 --> 02:09:21,810
Oh.

2807
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:24,070
Oh.

2808
02:09:33,030 --> 02:09:34,070
Oh, okay.

2809
02:09:35,850 --> 02:09:36,370
What

2810
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:45,380
the fuck?

2811
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:47,340
Oh, he's trying to think there...

2812
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:48,060
Oh my god.

2813
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:48,860
I'm fucking up here.

2814
02:09:54,490 --> 02:09:57,590
Oh my god, I didn't think there was actually a platform here.

2815
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:01,530
Okay, that was a leap of faith.

2816
02:10:01,690 --> 02:10:04,670
I did not think there was an actual platform on that side.

2817
02:10:06,350 --> 02:10:06,870
All right.

2818
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:07,490
Nice.

2819
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:13,610
Never punished.

2820
02:10:14,030 --> 02:10:16,990
All right,

2821
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:26,140
I'll do this way.

2822
02:10:30,820 --> 02:10:32,120
What the fuck did I put on my mark?

2823
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:34,320
Where did it go?

2824
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:42,720
Wait, it's somewhere here.

2825
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:44,240
Is it above me?

2826
02:10:46,980 --> 02:10:47,900
Wait, what?

2827
02:10:51,570 --> 02:10:52,130
Wait...

2828
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:53,290
Oh, there it is!

2829
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:54,390
Okay, I found it.

2830
02:10:55,950 --> 02:10:56,350
Okay.

2831
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:58,590
All right.

2832
02:10:59,870 --> 02:11:01,730
Time to invade this guy's world.

2833
02:11:06,180 --> 02:11:07,500
Where is he coming from?

2834
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:08,940
Oh, there he is.

2835
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:09,760
Oh, he has arrows.

2836
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:11,020
That's a nerd.

2837
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,680
That nerd.

2838
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:15,540
Oh, shit!

2839
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,220
Oh my god, nerd with blood!

2840
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:21,620
Oh, fuck.

2841
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:25,260
Oh my god, this nerd is fast.

2842
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:29,980
Oh, shit!

2843
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:33,540
Nice, we both thought the same thing.

2844
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:39,320
Backing up though.

2845
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:53,940
Oh my god, we both got each other.

2846
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:54,460
Oh!

2847
02:11:58,350 --> 02:11:59,430
Get out of here, nerd!

2848
02:12:01,490 --> 02:12:02,790
Oh my god, you fucker.

2849
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:07,010
That's fuckin' right!

2850
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:07,970
I beat first!

2851
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:09,050
Ah!

2852
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:12,620
I'm faster!

2853
02:12:12,940 --> 02:12:14,280
Haha, that's fuckin' right!

2854
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:17,000
That's right, I'm faster!

2855
02:12:17,380 --> 02:12:18,220
Let's go!

2856
02:12:18,220 --> 02:12:18,480
Oh!

2857
02:12:20,860 --> 02:12:22,400
I'm so much faster!

2858
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:25,000
That's right!

2859
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:28,900
Using range weapons!

2860
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:31,340
Yeah, I got...

2861
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:32,820
I got stuff.

2862
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:36,360
What if I can like...

2863
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:36,560
What if I can like...

2864
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:38,820
Is there any grace nearby up here?

2865
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:43,780
Guys, is there grace here?

2866
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:50,660
No?

2867
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:52,020
Okay, I'll leave.

2868
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:55,350
Here, oh wait, there's like...

2869
02:12:56,130 --> 02:12:57,630
Is this like where I'm supposed...

2870
02:12:57,630 --> 02:12:58,530
...for the next area?

2871
02:13:02,230 --> 02:13:03,330
Where's the castle?

2872
02:13:03,810 --> 02:13:04,530
This one?

2873
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:05,410
Oh, here.

2874
02:13:09,070 --> 02:13:10,330
Oh, there's the castle!

2875
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:12,110
There it is!

2876
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:20,550
Oh, I see it!

2877
02:13:20,670 --> 02:13:21,330
It's right over there!

2878
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:22,230
Oh, okay.

2879
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:24,730
Oh, no.

2880
02:13:25,190 --> 02:13:25,950
Oh, thank god!

2881
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:29,250
I dropped down and I...

2882
02:13:30,090 --> 02:13:31,050
Actual fear.

2883
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:36,690
When I dropped down, I legitimately thought I was...

2884
02:13:36,690 --> 02:13:38,470
I went to my death.

2885
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:42,650
Alright, nice.

2886
02:13:43,510 --> 02:13:44,210
Safe.

2887
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:48,250
Alright, lady, I did your...

2888
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:51,410
I did your second assassination.

2889
02:13:52,070 --> 02:13:54,190
I did the thing, ma'am.

2890
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:03,600
I did your stupid little assassination thing.

2891
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:08,160
I see you've performed another task.

2892
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:08,600
That's me!

2893
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:10,980
Here is your usual reward.

2894
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:14,300
Please, take it.

2895
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:16,220
Oh!

2896
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,060
That's a cute sword.

2897
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:21,780
Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you...

2898
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:24,300
The true ruler of this manor.

2899
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:26,580
Lord Reichard.

2900
02:14:27,380 --> 02:14:29,800
The erd tree blessed the tarnished with grace.

2901
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:34,780
But it was all too meagre in the face of the enormity of their task.

2902
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,560
Oh, that's the poison katana?

2903
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:37,500
Oh, it's over then!

2904
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:39,400
Squabbling for crumbs.

2905
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:44,040
Like the shard bearers vying for power in the wake of the shattering.

2906
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:54,040
Our lord, indignant, has refused to scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us.

2907
02:14:54,300 --> 02:15:05,260
If the erd tree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so, then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy.

2908
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:12,360
We at the volcano manor, under lord Reichard, have sworn no rest until it is done.

2909
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:18,420
If you follow this heroic path, one day the lord will see you.

2910
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:23,160
The lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle.

2911
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:26,320
It cannot come a day too soon.

2912
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:30,460
All right, it's time to kill your lord.

2913
02:15:30,860 --> 02:15:32,540
If you follow this heroic path...

2914
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,340
Okay, now I can kill him, right?

2915
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:38,220
All right, let's grab...

2916
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:43,460
Where is it?

2917
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:45,880
Is this one?

2918
02:15:45,980 --> 02:15:46,640
Oh, there it is.

2919
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:48,880
And I have two.

2920
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:51,860
Slashy, slashy!

2921
02:15:52,340 --> 02:15:53,570
All right, and then...

2922
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,900
Uh, oh wait, was it Y, X?

2923
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:00,400
Oh,

2924
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:04,840
there it is, all right.

2925
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:08,900
All right, now it's time to upgrade my blade!

2926
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:14,930
Okay, now I can...

2927
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:17,050
Now I can kill the boss, right?

2928
02:16:26,820 --> 02:16:27,640
No way.

2929
02:16:28,420 --> 02:16:29,600
I should have it.

2930
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,240
Lay out your arm.

2931
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,800
Yeah, I know I have enough for this one.

2932
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:36,060
Okay.

2933
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:38,640
I know a guy!

2934
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:39,860
Don't worry!

2935
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:41,880
What guy was it?

2936
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:43,200
I forgot, it's been so long.

2937
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:45,900
It's been so long since we saw him.

2938
02:16:45,900 --> 02:16:47,540
We know a guy, chat!

2939
02:16:57,680 --> 02:16:59,180
Where was it?

2940
02:16:59,240 --> 02:16:59,920
Where did he live?

2941
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:00,600
I forgot!

2942
02:17:01,820 --> 02:17:02,700
The South Lake?

2943
02:17:03,380 --> 02:17:05,600
The fuck is the South Lake?

2944
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,880
Which guy sells the stone?

2945
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,120
We know him!

2946
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:14,860
We know him!

2947
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:20,180
Oh, by the entrance?

2948
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:22,340
Where's that?

2949
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:24,580
What is that?

2950
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:36,070
The Lake Merchant?

2951
02:17:38,170 --> 02:17:39,230
Is it this guy?

2952
02:17:40,050 --> 02:17:41,470
Is this the guy that we know?

2953
02:17:42,470 --> 02:17:43,310
Could be him.

2954
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:51,240
Oh, there he is!

2955
02:17:51,340 --> 02:17:52,620
I told you, I knew a guy!

2956
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:55,000
Hello.

2957
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:59,800
I told you guys I knew a guy.

2958
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:04,380
Okay, we don't have enough though.

2959
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:07,540
Okay.

2960
02:18:08,220 --> 02:18:08,820
Fuck!

2961
02:18:09,060 --> 02:18:10,240
Okay, where are the mines?

2962
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:12,780
Where are the mines?

2963
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:14,920
Guys, we don't have enough.

2964
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:16,060
We need one more.

2965
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:21,220
Wait, I can't use katanas versus the...

2966
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:21,680
Why not?

2967
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:26,720
Way northeastern.

2968
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:36,490
Guys, not that mine.

2969
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:37,570
Anything but that mine.

2970
02:18:41,210 --> 02:18:43,430
Oh, I can buy them at the round table?

2971
02:18:43,850 --> 02:18:44,130
All right.

2972
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:52,840
This one?

2973
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:05,190
Guys, I...

2974
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:11,770
Which barrel barrel barrel should I...

2975
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:12,590
Offer this one?

2976
02:19:32,580 --> 02:19:33,420
Oh.

2977
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:35,480
This is awkward.

2978
02:19:36,220 --> 02:19:38,460
I literally just need one more.

2979
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,320
I need one more stone.

2980
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:51,170
I'm pretty sure.

2981
02:19:55,570 --> 02:19:56,790
Oh my god, I did.

2982
02:19:56,970 --> 02:19:57,890
I do need one more.

2983
02:19:59,870 --> 02:20:02,110
I need level one smithing stone.

2984
02:20:02,110 --> 02:20:03,630
But I don't know which mine it is.

2985
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:10,050
Okay, I'm pretty sure that mine does not have the level one smithing stone that we need.

2986
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:13,490
It seems a little too hard.

2987
02:20:14,670 --> 02:20:15,850
Wait, should we get that?

2988
02:20:19,350 --> 02:20:20,450
Should we get this one?

2989
02:20:26,310 --> 02:20:27,250
What's that do?

2990
02:20:38,610 --> 02:20:39,130
Oh.

2991
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:44,650
Oh, it's an extra here.

2992
02:20:45,390 --> 02:20:45,650
Oh.

2993
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:51,120
Okay.

2994
02:20:59,180 --> 02:20:59,700
Okay.

2995
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:00,580
Okay.

2996
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:02,800
Now we gotta figure out which mine this is.

2997
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:03,620
Where's the mine?

2998
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:16,280
Where is it?

2999
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:18,280
Where is it?

3000
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:19,600
East of Magic Academy.

3001
02:21:23,790 --> 02:21:24,510
Here?

3002
02:21:36,210 --> 02:21:37,490
In the lake.

3003
02:21:37,690 --> 02:21:38,750
Oh, in the lake?

3004
02:21:38,990 --> 02:21:39,770
Oh, here.

3005
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:49,560
Here.

3006
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:53,890
East.

3007
02:21:54,750 --> 02:21:55,950
Oh, that's west.

3008
02:21:57,870 --> 02:21:58,590
Here.

3009
02:22:04,590 --> 02:22:05,150
Here.

3010
02:22:05,170 --> 02:22:05,250
Yeah.

3011
02:22:06,650 --> 02:22:07,210
Okay.

3012
02:22:07,630 --> 02:22:08,630
This should be...

3013
02:22:08,630 --> 02:22:09,390
Is this one?

3014
02:22:10,890 --> 02:22:12,530
The random dot?

3015
02:22:22,070 --> 02:22:23,250
Wait, this is level two.

3016
02:22:23,350 --> 02:22:24,590
Guys, we need a level one.

3017
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:26,650
We need level one stones, guys.

3018
02:22:27,310 --> 02:22:28,210
We need...

3019
02:22:28,210 --> 02:22:29,970
We need level one.

3020
02:22:30,850 --> 02:22:31,830
Oh, here.

3021
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:31,910
Where?

3022
02:22:35,660 --> 02:22:36,400
This one.

3023
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:38,760
Okay.

3024
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:39,840
We figured it out.

3025
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:44,100
Okay, now I have to figure out how to get down.

3026
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:44,200
Down.

3027
02:22:44,840 --> 02:22:46,260
Get downstairs.

3028
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:47,160
Okay.

3029
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:49,160
Uh, here.

3030
02:22:57,030 --> 02:22:57,470
Okay.

3031
02:22:58,090 --> 02:22:59,910
Now we figured it out.

3032
02:23:00,490 --> 02:23:01,210
This way.

3033
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:11,100
Guys, we figured it out.

3034
02:23:18,610 --> 02:23:19,490
We're doing it.

3035
02:23:19,570 --> 02:23:19,930
We're learning.

3036
02:23:20,110 --> 02:23:21,150
We're Elden ringing, guys.

3037
02:23:21,550 --> 02:23:22,470
We're doing it.

3038
02:23:26,690 --> 02:23:29,370
This is exactly why I brought up Google Maps.

3039
02:23:35,450 --> 02:23:36,170
All right.

3040
02:23:36,450 --> 02:23:37,270
Grab it this way.

3041
02:23:42,630 --> 02:23:43,470
Oh my god.

3042
02:23:43,630 --> 02:23:44,310
It's so far.

3043
02:23:44,770 --> 02:23:46,570
It's so fucking far.

3044
02:23:50,570 --> 02:23:51,730
Why can't you...

3045
02:23:51,730 --> 02:23:53,610
Why can't I level up my horse?

3046
02:23:55,430 --> 02:23:57,170
I should be allowed to level him up.

3047
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:04,370
Okay, we should be almost there.

3048
02:24:07,570 --> 02:24:08,890
What are these guys doing?

3049
02:24:09,490 --> 02:24:10,450
They're just chilling.

3050
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:12,370
Oh hey, there's jellyfish.

3051
02:24:14,690 --> 02:24:16,350
Hello, little jellyfish.

3052
02:24:17,030 --> 02:24:19,150
Oh, there's evil jellyfish too.

3053
02:24:19,730 --> 02:24:21,590
Hello, evil jellyfish.

3054
02:24:22,750 --> 02:24:24,110
Oh, they're all evil!

3055
02:24:24,310 --> 02:24:24,970
They're all...

3056
02:24:30,790 --> 02:24:32,350
Okay, they're all evil.

3057
02:24:36,170 --> 02:24:36,750
All right.

3058
02:24:36,990 --> 02:24:37,890
This should be it.

3059
02:24:38,050 --> 02:24:38,790
Oh, I hear a bell.

3060
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:46,090
Why is there a bell here?

3061
02:24:46,930 --> 02:24:47,730
Hello, guys.

3062
02:24:49,870 --> 02:24:50,950
What you guys doing?

3063
02:24:53,850 --> 02:24:54,730
Ping-bong.

3064
02:24:57,410 --> 02:24:58,430
Oh wait, I...

3065
02:24:58,430 --> 02:24:59,310
I'm not there yet.

3066
02:24:59,670 --> 02:24:59,910
Whoops.

3067
02:25:01,350 --> 02:25:02,630
Sorry, I got distracted.

3068
02:25:03,150 --> 02:25:04,290
I heard a giant bell.

3069
02:25:05,650 --> 02:25:07,870
Oh, it's another one of these things!

3070
02:25:08,570 --> 02:25:09,050
Oh!

3071
02:25:10,090 --> 02:25:11,450
We don't need that yet though.

3072
02:25:14,390 --> 02:25:15,650
Yeah, but we don't need that.

3073
02:25:17,950 --> 02:25:20,170
Okay, the mines should be somewhere here.

3074
02:25:21,570 --> 02:25:23,770
I'm yearning for the mines right now.

3075
02:25:27,370 --> 02:25:29,190
I yearn for the mines!

3076
02:25:32,350 --> 02:25:35,050
The filler episode was in my filler episode.

3077
02:25:38,190 --> 02:25:39,330
Oh, there it is.

3078
02:25:41,910 --> 02:25:42,510
Nice.

3079
02:25:44,550 --> 02:25:45,270
All right.

3080
02:25:51,350 --> 02:25:52,150
All right.

3081
02:25:53,710 --> 02:25:55,410
My filler within filler.

3082
02:25:58,010 --> 02:25:59,270
Okay, here I'll go.

3083
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:10,660
All right, let's make sure we have everything we need.

3084
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:11,600
All right, let's go!

3085
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:13,660
Filler attack.

3086
02:26:13,820 --> 02:26:14,260
What's he doing?

3087
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:16,340
What's he doing?

3088
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:19,080
What the fuck is that?

3089
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:20,020
What is that guy doing?

3090
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:23,520
All right.

3091
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:26,860
How do I...

3092
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:30,720
Oh my god, he's so fucking...

3093
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:33,340
Like...

3094
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:37,360
Guys, how do I use my second one?

3095
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:39,020
He didn't sleep.

3096
02:26:45,010 --> 02:26:46,870
Or is it because he's made of rocks?

3097
02:26:47,150 --> 02:26:47,910
Is that why?

3098
02:26:54,550 --> 02:26:56,710
Oh my god, he tried to nerd his way out.

3099
02:26:58,470 --> 02:26:59,850
L1 and L2?

3100
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:01,250
Oh!

3101
02:27:02,710 --> 02:27:03,250
Okay.

3102
02:27:04,830 --> 02:27:05,270
Okay.

3103
02:27:11,190 --> 02:27:13,710
Okay, L1 and L2 uses both.

3104
02:27:21,710 --> 02:27:22,950
Okay, that's good to know.

3105
02:27:26,110 --> 02:27:28,190
I need, like, the yellow rocks.

3106
02:27:28,250 --> 02:27:28,970
These aren't yellow.

3107
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:36,260
Do they hurt me?

3108
02:27:44,350 --> 02:27:45,430
My god.

3109
02:27:46,430 --> 02:27:48,090
Oh my god.

3110
02:27:48,330 --> 02:27:48,470
Okay.

3111
02:27:49,750 --> 02:27:50,390
Okay.

3112
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:01,100
Oh my god, what is he doing?

3113
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:04,120
All right, there we go.

3114
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:06,020
Wait, is this heavy roll?

3115
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:08,000
Oh my god, this is heavy roll.

3116
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:12,760
Okay, let's just...

3117
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:14,460
Let's use one for now.

3118
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:14,980
And then...

3119
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:19,900
Yeah, let's...

3120
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:21,460
Let's just use one for now.

3121
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:26,440
Do I have dead stain?

3122
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:28,780
Oh, but there's something over here.

3123
02:28:29,160 --> 02:28:30,080
Can I make that?

3124
02:28:31,420 --> 02:28:32,680
I don't know if I can.

3125
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:36,080
Can I make that jump?

3126
02:28:36,580 --> 02:28:38,080
Can I even make that?

3127
02:28:46,630 --> 02:28:48,650
Slow and steady, Doki.

3128
02:28:49,450 --> 02:28:50,710
Slow and steady.

3129
02:28:52,030 --> 02:28:52,210
No.

3130
02:28:52,450 --> 02:28:53,110
Wait, how did he die?

3131
02:29:04,690 --> 02:29:06,170
Okay, that's not him.

3132
02:29:11,570 --> 02:29:12,330
Okay.

3133
02:29:13,310 --> 02:29:14,870
He's a little special.

3134
02:29:15,410 --> 02:29:17,350
He's our special little guy.

3135
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:22,940
I did it.

3136
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:24,500
Coming in hot.

3137
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:25,660
On your left.

3138
02:29:38,830 --> 02:29:39,590
Okay.

3139
02:29:47,330 --> 02:29:48,290
All right, let's go.

3140
02:29:48,410 --> 02:29:49,310
Let's go back.

3141
02:29:49,570 --> 02:29:50,650
Let's go back.

3142
02:29:52,450 --> 02:29:54,270
I'm the special little guy.

3143
02:29:55,310 --> 02:29:56,450
Oh my god.

3144
02:29:56,630 --> 02:29:57,590
I'm not getting that.

3145
02:29:57,850 --> 02:29:59,090
That's not worth it.

3146
02:29:59,190 --> 02:30:01,330
It's absolutely not worth it.

3147
02:30:04,330 --> 02:30:05,210
It's not...

3148
02:30:05,210 --> 02:30:05,510
Unless...

3149
02:30:05,510 --> 02:30:06,450
Oh, I'm gonna be too!

3150
02:30:06,590 --> 02:30:06,770
Fuck!

3151
02:30:06,950 --> 02:30:07,470
Okay, it's fine.

3152
02:30:07,650 --> 02:30:08,090
That's fine.

3153
02:30:08,690 --> 02:30:09,350
That's fine.

3154
02:30:10,610 --> 02:30:11,790
It's 4,000.

3155
02:30:11,990 --> 02:30:14,030
We don't need 4,000.

3156
02:30:16,030 --> 02:30:16,810
It's fine.

3157
02:30:17,170 --> 02:30:18,290
I don't need that.

3158
02:30:23,530 --> 02:30:24,350
Thanks, guys.

3159
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:25,210
Wow, guys.

3160
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:27,090
You think I need a sprint jump for that?

3161
02:30:28,450 --> 02:30:29,390
I'm not...

3162
02:30:29,390 --> 02:30:31,150
We're not going...

3163
02:30:31,150 --> 02:30:31,770
Which one?

3164
02:30:31,930 --> 02:30:32,910
What did I miss?

3165
02:30:34,190 --> 02:30:35,210
Oh, there is one.

3166
02:30:35,310 --> 02:30:35,770
You're right.

3167
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:39,170
All right, we got it.

3168
02:30:43,570 --> 02:30:45,910
God, we found two, but we need a level one.

3169
02:30:47,770 --> 02:30:49,270
I haven't seen level ones yet.

3170
02:30:50,490 --> 02:30:50,950
Get

3171
02:30:57,500 --> 02:30:58,400
him out of the way through.

3172
02:31:02,470 --> 02:31:03,390
Jesus Christ.

3173
02:31:04,610 --> 02:31:05,630
Oh, fuck!

3174
02:31:05,930 --> 02:31:07,150
Oh my god!

3175
02:31:09,570 --> 02:31:10,810
I got ganged.

3176
02:31:11,230 --> 02:31:11,970
Ganged up on.

3177
02:31:14,170 --> 02:31:16,310
Gang violence is not a joke, guys.

3178
02:31:22,250 --> 02:31:22,810
Jesus!

3179
02:31:23,090 --> 02:31:23,310
Okay.

3180
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:25,410
I didn't think that was gonna happen, but okay.

3181
02:31:28,050 --> 02:31:29,130
All right, that's fine.

3182
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:37,200
Oh my god.

3183
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:38,120
I'm gonna brute force that.

3184
02:31:44,250 --> 02:31:45,890
No, I wanted to get this guy!

3185
02:31:48,510 --> 02:31:49,310
Oh, thank god.

3186
02:31:50,090 --> 02:31:51,530
Oh, thank god he stumbled.

3187
02:31:53,090 --> 02:31:53,870
God damn it.

3188
02:31:53,950 --> 02:31:55,290
I need level one!

3189
02:31:56,970 --> 02:31:58,470
Where are the level ones?

3190
02:31:59,810 --> 02:32:00,730
Oh, I didn't see...

3191
02:32:00,730 --> 02:32:01,910
Oh, I didn't see drop loot.

3192
02:32:03,790 --> 02:32:05,010
Somber smithing stone.

3193
02:32:06,890 --> 02:32:09,850
Oh no, I'm not using the poison katana right now.

3194
02:32:09,930 --> 02:32:11,370
I'm using the regular one.

3195
02:32:14,410 --> 02:32:15,730
Oh, I'll get it later?

3196
02:32:22,910 --> 02:32:23,530
All right.

3197
02:32:24,190 --> 02:32:25,690
Oh my god, they're all level threes.

3198
02:32:31,330 --> 02:32:32,570
All right, we go this way.

3199
02:32:35,050 --> 02:32:36,470
Longest filler episode.

3200
02:32:46,130 --> 02:32:47,490
Okay, this way.

3201
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:49,770
Whoops.

3202
02:32:50,210 --> 02:32:51,830
Actually set my elevator back...

3203
02:32:51,830 --> 02:32:52,450
back up.

3204
02:32:54,970 --> 02:32:57,870
Guys, we haven't seen a story boss in like...

3205
02:32:58,290 --> 02:33:00,390
I think two years now.

3206
02:33:03,430 --> 02:33:04,850
We gotta kill this guy.

3207
02:33:07,470 --> 02:33:08,890
And I hope that...

3208
02:33:08,890 --> 02:33:10,750
Oh my god, I keep thinking he's gonna like...

3209
02:33:10,750 --> 02:33:11,610
drop me or some shit.

3210
02:33:14,070 --> 02:33:14,470
Nice.

3211
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:21,660
He knows I'm here.

3212
02:33:23,220 --> 02:33:24,180
Please don't set magic.

3213
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:25,100
Please don't set magic.

3214
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:25,980
Please don't set magic.

3215
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:27,740
Oh my god.

3216
02:33:27,880 --> 02:33:28,620
Oh god, thank god.

3217
02:33:28,820 --> 02:33:29,120
Okay.

3218
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:32,180
Oh my god.

3219
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,060
That was so scary.

3220
02:33:34,340 --> 02:33:36,560
I thought he was gonna fucking send me off the...

3221
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:37,380
the tank.

3222
02:33:42,340 --> 02:33:42,560
Okay.

3223
02:33:43,540 --> 02:33:44,440
Oh thank god.

3224
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:45,540
I'm okay.

3225
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:47,980
I'm okay.

3226
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:49,460
I live.

3227
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:52,400
My death was exaggerated.

3228
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:55,560
Wait, you're so scared of a nerd.

3229
02:33:55,960 --> 02:33:56,480
Jokey.

3230
02:33:56,700 --> 02:33:58,560
Okay, I am next to a cliff.

3231
02:33:59,940 --> 02:34:02,760
There is a reason why I'm scared.

3232
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:06,220
If I wasn't next to a fucking cliff, I would be fine.

3233
02:34:11,490 --> 02:34:12,930
Okay, grab this.

3234
02:34:15,630 --> 02:34:17,070
Okay, into that tunnel.

3235
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:19,190
How far away is this boss?

3236
02:34:20,850 --> 02:34:21,990
You wear it, right?

3237
02:34:22,930 --> 02:34:23,550
That guy?

3238
02:34:25,070 --> 02:34:25,830
I got...

3239
02:34:25,830 --> 02:34:26,590
Oh, that guy!

3240
02:34:27,650 --> 02:34:28,330
Oh, wait.

3241
02:34:28,750 --> 02:34:29,490
Okay, never mind.

3242
02:34:31,610 --> 02:34:33,690
Okay, I may be over leveled for this area.

3243
02:34:37,130 --> 02:34:38,390
Oh, there we go.

3244
02:34:38,490 --> 02:34:38,950
We did it.

3245
02:34:39,070 --> 02:34:39,670
We got something.

3246
02:34:39,950 --> 02:34:40,230
Okay.

3247
02:34:40,710 --> 02:34:42,710
Okay, I'm over leveled.

3248
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:50,580
Okay, get out of here.

3249
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:52,200
Yeah, I think so.

3250
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:55,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3251
02:34:55,880 --> 02:34:56,400
These guys again?

3252
02:34:57,560 --> 02:34:58,060
There you go.

3253
02:34:58,900 --> 02:34:59,860
Use magic?

3254
02:35:03,900 --> 02:35:04,800
Oh, shit!

3255
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:05,860
Oh, shit!

3256
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:08,840
Oh, my God!

3257
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:09,780
They meant that right!

3258
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:10,760
He meant his right!

3259
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:14,840
Gravity was discovered by Isaac Newton.

3260
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:16,500
You are scared of a nerd.

3261
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:18,980
Thank you for the super chat, Kevin.

3262
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:20,140
Thank you, thank you.

3263
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:22,380
Yeah, but who's dead right now?

3264
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:25,240
That's right.

3265
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:27,940
You're king of the nerds is dead now.

3266
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:37,580
Yeah, this is a never-ending filler episode.

3267
02:35:44,690 --> 02:35:45,710
That's fine.

3268
02:35:49,350 --> 02:35:51,010
Oh, my God!

3269
02:35:51,350 --> 02:35:53,310
I, like, turned to my right!

3270
02:35:54,250 --> 02:35:55,510
Holy shit!

3271
02:35:55,510 --> 02:35:57,030
Oh, my God!

3272
02:35:57,130 --> 02:35:57,850
I did not expect that!

3273
02:35:58,050 --> 02:35:59,390
I did not expect that!

3274
02:35:59,810 --> 02:36:00,610
Holy shit!

3275
02:36:00,690 --> 02:36:01,570
Where did he come from?

3276
02:36:01,930 --> 02:36:03,910
Where the fuck did this guy come from?

3277
02:36:04,030 --> 02:36:05,110
Oh, my God!

3278
02:36:05,990 --> 02:36:07,470
It was not fun!

3279
02:36:09,950 --> 02:36:12,290
Where the fuck is this man came from?

3280
02:36:13,970 --> 02:36:16,230
He's here right behind me, isn't he?

3281
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:26,720
Who we got?

3282
02:36:29,710 --> 02:36:32,710
Okay, we got him killed before he could do anything.

3283
02:36:34,630 --> 02:36:36,910
He's here right behind me, guys.

3284
02:36:40,370 --> 02:36:42,230
We got Smithing Stone.

3285
02:36:43,410 --> 02:36:46,190
Holy shit, there's so many stones in this one area.

3286
02:36:51,710 --> 02:36:52,310
Hello?

3287
02:36:52,630 --> 02:36:53,790
Oh, nice item.

3288
02:36:58,120 --> 02:36:59,640
Oh, there's a stone here.

3289
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:03,080
Don't they be mad?

3290
02:37:03,400 --> 02:37:04,140
Oh, they are.

3291
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:11,600
Guys, I think they were mad.

3292
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:12,520
I think they were mad.

3293
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:19,880
Guys, they were definitely mad.

3294
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:26,700
I think they were mad.

3295
02:37:26,700 --> 02:37:27,200
What was that?

3296
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:29,860
All right.

3297
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:32,200
Yeah, but I feel like they don't have any in here.

3298
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:34,860
Yeah, see, they don't have, like, any yellow ones here.

3299
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:36,600
Yeah.

3300
02:37:37,220 --> 02:37:38,640
I don't know why they weren't so happy.

3301
02:37:38,940 --> 02:37:41,600
It took them, like, so long to grab those rocks.

3302
02:37:41,980 --> 02:37:44,120
And then he came over there and just yanked it out.

3303
02:37:44,740 --> 02:37:46,120
Why would they be so mad?

3304
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:46,540
Mad.

3305
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:49,260
First off here.

3306
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,060
And so I was like, you can grab it without fighting.

3307
02:37:55,140 --> 02:37:55,620
I was like, really?

3308
02:37:56,820 --> 02:37:59,040
See, this is why I have trust issues.

3309
02:38:03,790 --> 02:38:04,830
All right, this way.

3310
02:38:04,990 --> 02:38:05,870
Oh, there's the boss.

3311
02:38:10,010 --> 02:38:12,030
We foe ahead, just in case.

3312
02:38:12,510 --> 02:38:13,650
Just in case.

3313
02:38:16,990 --> 02:38:17,470
Head?

3314
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:25,620
What's this guy?

3315
02:38:26,620 --> 02:38:28,700
I don't have enough magic.

3316
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:30,260
Oh my god.

3317
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:35,120
What?

3318
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:37,220
Wait, what?

3319
02:38:42,020 --> 02:38:43,300
Oh my god.

3320
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:44,620
Okay, I don't know how it is that.

3321
02:38:45,580 --> 02:38:45,900
Okay.

3322
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:47,280
Jellyfish.

3323
02:38:50,940 --> 02:38:52,000
Oh, thank god.

3324
02:38:55,410 --> 02:38:56,770
Oh, now he's breakable.

3325
02:38:56,910 --> 02:38:57,170
Nice.

3326
02:38:57,410 --> 02:38:57,530
Okay.

3327
02:38:57,790 --> 02:38:58,470
That's good.

3328
02:39:01,490 --> 02:39:02,250
That's good.

3329
02:39:04,290 --> 02:39:05,410
Oh my god.

3330
02:39:05,590 --> 02:39:06,370
Okay, that's not good.

3331
02:39:09,150 --> 02:39:10,530
Get out of here.

3332
02:39:11,070 --> 02:39:12,250
Get shatted.

3333
02:39:12,850 --> 02:39:13,930
That's okay, right.

3334
02:39:15,310 --> 02:39:15,870
Easy.

3335
02:39:15,870 --> 02:39:16,070
Easy.

3336
02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:19,070
I did it.

3337
02:39:19,170 --> 02:39:19,610
Yippee.

3338
02:39:19,990 --> 02:39:22,970
Is there any extra stuff here?

3339
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:28,500
All right, nice.

3340
02:39:31,910 --> 02:39:32,950
That's right.

3341
02:39:33,470 --> 02:39:34,850
Backshot for days.

3342
02:39:36,610 --> 02:39:38,230
Now I have the stone.

3343
02:39:43,710 --> 02:39:44,210
Okay.

3344
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:51,020
Okay, I should have enough now.

3345
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:54,040
Okay, first, let's upgrade our katana first.

3346
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:57,340
Okay, let's upgrade.

3347
02:40:01,300 --> 02:40:02,420
All right.

3348
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:05,440
Oh wait, I have this.

3349
02:40:05,660 --> 02:40:06,600
Wait, I should upgrade this first.

3350
02:40:07,640 --> 02:40:07,920
Yeah.

3351
02:40:12,700 --> 02:40:13,400
All right.

3352
02:40:13,660 --> 02:40:14,700
I'll upgrade that first.

3353
02:40:16,780 --> 02:40:18,000
Okay, and then...

3354
02:40:22,370 --> 02:40:23,730
Then I'll grab this.

3355
02:40:25,230 --> 02:40:26,650
Back over in our mat town.

3356
02:40:27,490 --> 02:40:28,030
All right.

3357
02:40:28,450 --> 02:40:29,730
And I should have enough for this.

3358
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:29,990
Yeah.

3359
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:32,970
And then I need more smithing stone one.

3360
02:40:36,250 --> 02:40:36,910
All right.

3361
02:40:40,450 --> 02:40:41,090
Let's go.

3362
02:40:41,190 --> 02:40:44,630
Ever since I got my beach episode, it's been filler since.

3363
02:40:46,370 --> 02:40:49,790
We've been in an eternal Elden Ring filler episode.

3364
02:40:52,690 --> 02:40:53,190
Yeah.

3365
02:40:55,290 --> 02:40:55,790
What's this?

3366
02:40:56,010 --> 02:40:56,710
Oh, here it is.

3367
02:40:57,550 --> 02:40:58,790
I need like, what?

3368
02:40:59,070 --> 02:40:59,370
Four?

3369
02:40:59,850 --> 02:41:00,930
How many do I need?

3370
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:02,190
Six?

3371
02:41:02,770 --> 02:41:03,630
I don't remember.

3372
02:41:08,550 --> 02:41:09,170
All right.

3373
02:41:12,310 --> 02:41:12,790
Hello.

3374
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:15,330
I'm here to upgrade my katana.

3375
02:41:20,510 --> 02:41:21,170
All right.

3376
02:41:21,610 --> 02:41:22,850
Oh, I have enough for this.

3377
02:41:24,530 --> 02:41:26,430
Oh, now I need smithing stone three.

3378
02:41:26,490 --> 02:41:27,250
Okay, I don't have that.

3379
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:29,290
I don't have that.

3380
02:41:29,870 --> 02:41:30,230
All right.

3381
02:41:30,330 --> 02:41:30,890
But that's enough.

3382
02:41:31,690 --> 02:41:33,090
That should be enough now.

3383
02:41:33,930 --> 02:41:34,290
All right.

3384
02:41:34,370 --> 02:41:34,630
Nice.

3385
02:41:34,830 --> 02:41:35,050
Okay.

3386
02:41:35,050 --> 02:41:36,890
I forgot what the our main quest.

3387
02:41:37,670 --> 02:41:38,150
Okay.

3388
02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:38,690
Now.

3389
02:41:39,730 --> 02:41:42,930
Now we can beat up the other boss.

3390
02:41:43,070 --> 02:41:43,310
Okay.

3391
02:41:43,530 --> 02:41:44,370
Oh, I needed souls.

3392
02:41:44,630 --> 02:41:45,570
Oh, I just needed souls.

3393
02:41:45,770 --> 02:41:46,310
Oh my God.

3394
02:41:46,310 --> 02:41:47,510
I'm so out of...

3395
02:41:47,510 --> 02:41:48,010
Okay.

3396
02:41:48,170 --> 02:41:49,710
This isn't the area I have to go anyway.

3397
02:41:50,030 --> 02:41:50,690
That's fine.

3398
02:41:51,830 --> 02:41:52,530
It's fine.

3399
02:41:52,530 --> 02:41:53,590
I have more souls here.

3400
02:41:58,500 --> 02:41:59,120
All right.

3401
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:00,540
Back to the round table.

3402
02:42:00,740 --> 02:42:01,560
I got lost.

3403
02:42:06,950 --> 02:42:07,230
All right.

3404
02:42:09,050 --> 02:42:09,510
I made that...

3405
02:42:10,110 --> 02:42:10,970
That ain't mean.

3406
02:42:19,390 --> 02:42:19,990
Okay.

3407
02:42:20,690 --> 02:42:21,170
Okay.

3408
02:42:21,330 --> 02:42:21,550
Now.

3409
02:42:22,030 --> 02:42:22,890
Now we're done.

3410
02:42:23,110 --> 02:42:23,290
All right.

3411
02:42:23,630 --> 02:42:23,910
Now.

3412
02:42:23,930 --> 02:42:25,410
We gotta kill the guy.

3413
02:42:28,510 --> 02:42:30,670
But first off, apparently there's another letter.

3414
02:42:30,990 --> 02:42:32,890
One last letter and then I kill the guy.

3415
02:42:38,220 --> 02:42:38,640
Okay.

3416
02:42:38,820 --> 02:42:39,120
That's heavy.

3417
02:42:39,480 --> 02:42:39,820
Let's get that.

3418
02:42:40,840 --> 02:42:41,680
Let's fix that.

3419
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:45,340
Okay.

3420
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:48,100
Now.

3421
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:48,920
It should be fine.

3422
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:50,460
There we go.

3423
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:51,500
All right.

3424
02:43:00,250 --> 02:43:01,390
Is there any more letters?

3425
02:43:01,470 --> 02:43:02,030
Or no?

3426
02:43:02,790 --> 02:43:03,830
Or is that the last one?

3427
02:43:04,310 --> 02:43:04,630
Oh wait.

3428
02:43:04,670 --> 02:43:05,130
There's no letter.

3429
02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:07,110
All right.

3430
02:43:08,150 --> 02:43:08,850
Back to him.

3431
02:43:09,030 --> 02:43:09,310
Again?

3432
02:43:10,170 --> 02:43:12,530
So, you've blooded your sword in the hunt.

3433
02:43:13,250 --> 02:43:15,810
Then I shall introduce myself once more.

3434
02:43:16,410 --> 02:43:17,130
Banal.

3435
02:43:17,950 --> 02:43:19,150
A recusant.

3436
02:43:19,370 --> 02:43:20,230
Just like you.

3437
02:43:20,950 --> 02:43:23,390
Recusants have particular battle arts.

3438
02:43:24,110 --> 02:43:26,110
Styled to our methods of slaughter.

3439
02:43:26,890 --> 02:43:28,730
Why not add some to your repertoire?

3440
02:43:30,510 --> 02:43:31,230
Okay.

3441
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:32,430
What does he do?

3442
02:43:32,670 --> 02:43:33,530
Oh, I don't need that.

3443
02:43:34,170 --> 02:43:34,510
Bye.

3444
02:43:39,550 --> 02:43:40,270
Uh.

3445
02:43:42,490 --> 02:43:43,930
Where's my...

3446
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:47,300
What's that?

3447
02:43:49,320 --> 02:43:49,980
Fuck.

3448
02:43:51,300 --> 02:43:52,340
Yeah, no.

3449
02:43:54,660 --> 02:43:55,640
All right.

3450
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:57,260
Now.

3451
02:43:58,440 --> 02:44:01,060
Now it's time to kill him.

3452
02:44:01,360 --> 02:44:02,700
For real now.

3453
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:04,740
All right.

3454
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:06,860
There we go.

3455
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:08,460
Is it time?

3456
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:10,100
It's time, right?

3457
02:44:12,350 --> 02:44:13,780
Now it's time.

3458
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:15,500
I'm coming in.

3459
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:16,800
Oh no.

3460
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:19,540
Wait.

3461
02:44:20,300 --> 02:44:20,680
No!

3462
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,720
Keep accidentally pressing the wrong button.

3463
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:28,260
Are you fucking kidding me?

3464
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:31,020
Oh my god!

3465
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:37,200
All right.

3466
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:39,200
Where the fuck is my stu...

3467
02:44:43,950 --> 02:44:44,710
All right.

3468
02:44:45,110 --> 02:44:46,150
Can I upgrade this?

3469
02:44:46,330 --> 02:44:46,890
Can I...

3470
02:44:46,890 --> 02:44:48,170
Can I upgrade?

3471
02:44:51,010 --> 02:44:53,250
Are you fucking kidding me?

3472
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:54,330
I...

3473
02:44:54,330 --> 02:44:56,270
Oh my god!

3474
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:11,030
It said there's lava!

3475
02:45:18,070 --> 02:45:19,710
Stupid fucking snake!

3476
02:45:20,090 --> 02:45:21,390
Stupid snake!

3477
02:45:22,330 --> 02:45:23,790
Stupid snake!

3478
02:45:23,970 --> 02:45:26,090
I upgraded my katana just for you!

3479
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:37,520
I said it's just for the stupid snake!

3480
02:45:50,430 --> 02:45:52,490
Oh my god, of course.

3481
02:45:54,030 --> 02:45:54,590
Okay.

3482
02:45:56,410 --> 02:45:57,530
Get out of here!

3483
02:45:57,770 --> 02:45:58,630
Get out of here!

3484
02:45:59,270 --> 02:45:59,830
Castle

3485
02:46:23,370 --> 02:46:24,030
for free!

3486
02:46:29,670 --> 02:46:30,230
Okay.

3487
02:46:31,890 --> 02:46:32,850
Get out!

3488
02:46:33,350 --> 02:46:35,050
I'm gonna pay your bill!

3489
02:46:35,230 --> 02:46:35,890
Oh fuck!

3490
02:46:36,090 --> 02:46:37,810
Okay, maybe you can live here a little longer.

3491
02:46:38,050 --> 02:46:38,550
Oh, bye.

3492
02:46:39,230 --> 02:46:39,410
It's fine.

3493
02:46:39,590 --> 02:46:40,890
You can live here a little longer if you want.

3494
02:46:41,010 --> 02:46:41,470
It's fine.

3495
02:46:44,670 --> 02:46:45,450
There you go.

3496
02:46:45,810 --> 02:46:46,470
He's dead.

3497
02:46:47,790 --> 02:46:48,590
He's looking...

3498
02:46:48,590 --> 02:46:50,430
Wait, he's not dead?!

3499
02:46:50,430 --> 02:46:51,530
Okay, I was gonna sit.

3500
02:46:53,870 --> 02:46:55,010
What the fuck do I do?

3501
02:47:03,690 --> 02:47:05,030
Okay, this is a phase two.

3502
02:47:05,150 --> 02:47:05,910
There's no way.

3503
02:47:06,110 --> 02:47:06,390
There...

3504
02:47:06,390 --> 02:47:06,910
Oh my god.

3505
02:47:06,910 --> 02:47:07,550
I knew it.

3506
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:09,050
I knew there was a phase two.

3507
02:47:09,330 --> 02:47:09,810
I...

3508
02:47:10,750 --> 02:47:12,630
I fucking knew it!

3509
02:47:13,050 --> 02:47:15,690
How far did it go down all the way?

3510
02:47:17,490 --> 02:47:22,550
I understand your anger, but you didn't have to call me stupid repeatedly.

3511
02:47:23,190 --> 02:47:25,490
Snake, thank you for the super chat.

3512
02:47:25,710 --> 02:47:26,290
Thank you, Snake.

3513
02:47:26,530 --> 02:47:27,630
I fucking knew it.

3514
02:47:27,930 --> 02:47:30,030
I knew there was a phase two.

3515
02:47:30,030 --> 02:47:32,950
I was like, why is there...

3516
02:47:32,950 --> 02:47:34,310
Why is the head...

3517
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:35,910
Why is there not one HP?

3518
02:47:44,230 --> 02:47:47,430
I'm sorry, I'm sticking with the super chat.

3519
02:47:47,690 --> 02:47:51,150
Oh, that's gross.

3520
02:47:51,730 --> 02:47:52,470
Oh my god.

3521
02:47:52,670 --> 02:47:53,790
That's pretty fucking gross.

3522
02:47:54,470 --> 02:47:55,190
Look.

3523
02:47:55,650 --> 02:47:57,570
Like, that's like his innards and everything.

3524
02:48:07,310 --> 02:48:08,610
What the fuck?

3525
02:48:11,650 --> 02:48:12,830
Holy shit.

3526
02:48:13,330 --> 02:48:15,130
That was like arms and a snake.

3527
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:17,310
Oh my god.

3528
02:48:17,590 --> 02:48:21,910
Oh my god.

3529
02:48:22,210 --> 02:48:23,570
How do I kill you?

3530
02:48:23,870 --> 02:48:25,510
How do I kill you?

3531
02:48:25,510 --> 02:48:27,570
How do I?

3532
02:48:29,570 --> 02:48:31,530
Oh my god.

3533
02:48:32,750 --> 02:48:34,590
Oh my god.

3534
02:48:34,810 --> 02:48:36,650
Oh my god.

3535
02:48:36,830 --> 02:48:37,830
Please, dad.

3536
02:48:37,990 --> 02:48:39,450
I'm fucking freaking out right now.

3537
02:48:42,890 --> 02:48:43,430
Okay.

3538
02:48:45,990 --> 02:48:46,650
All right.

3539
02:48:48,330 --> 02:48:49,730
Oh my god.

3540
02:48:50,390 --> 02:48:53,630
I'm like getting hit by everything right now.

3541
02:48:55,510 --> 02:48:57,330
I'm actually getting hit by everything.

3542
02:48:57,610 --> 02:48:59,070
Because I'm so confused.

3543
02:49:02,050 --> 02:49:03,430
I'm so confused.

3544
02:49:03,910 --> 02:49:05,690
I'm worried that like...

3545
02:49:06,510 --> 02:49:08,110
I'm so confused guys.

3546
02:49:17,470 --> 02:49:18,670
Where am I?

3547
02:49:19,050 --> 02:49:20,450
Oh my god.

3548
02:49:20,790 --> 02:49:21,910
Where am I?

3549
02:49:21,910 --> 02:49:22,790
Oh my god.

3550
02:49:22,790 --> 02:49:26,050
Oh my god.

3551
02:49:26,290 --> 02:49:27,610
No, please.

3552
02:49:28,270 --> 02:49:30,150
I can't focus.

3553
02:49:30,990 --> 02:49:33,050
I can't fuck stop.

3554
02:49:34,610 --> 02:49:35,470
What do you want?

3555
02:49:35,930 --> 02:49:39,390
I don't know what you want.

3556
02:49:39,670 --> 02:49:41,150
It's not even feeding time.

3557
02:49:44,950 --> 02:49:45,530
Okay.

3558
02:49:45,990 --> 02:49:48,050
Is it worth upgrading this?

3559
02:49:49,330 --> 02:49:52,090
Is it worth upgrading this story?

3560
02:49:52,930 --> 02:49:55,030
Welcome to the Auris dimension.

3561
02:49:56,210 --> 02:49:56,630
Thank you.

3562
02:49:57,450 --> 02:50:00,250
Thank you for the super chat.

3563
02:50:00,730 --> 02:50:01,870

Thank you.

3568
02:50:06,230 --> 02:50:09,410
Now we can devour the gods together.

3569
02:50:15,370 --> 02:50:16,570
Oh my god!

3570
02:50:16,650 --> 02:50:17,690
And then he walked away!

3571
02:50:28,250 --> 02:50:30,390
He walked away.

3572
02:50:30,850 --> 02:50:33,670
He actually walked away.

3573
02:50:34,650 --> 02:50:35,930
I can't.

3574
02:50:36,570 --> 02:50:38,070
I can't with my dog.

3575
02:50:38,610 --> 02:50:39,610
I can't.

3576
02:50:44,170 --> 02:50:45,410
Here we go.

3577
02:50:48,870 --> 02:50:50,170
Here we go.

3578
02:50:52,210 --> 02:50:54,110
Oh my god.

3579
02:50:54,750 --> 02:51:02,670
He had... I'm so... I'm... I'm... I... I... I... I... I'm gonna use the bat too.

3580
02:51:03,330 --> 02:51:05,030
I'm so mad.

3581
02:51:05,330 --> 02:51:06,770
He walked away!

3582
02:51:59,730 --> 02:52:00,610
I'm back.

3583
02:52:00,610 --> 02:52:01,390
I'm okay.

3584
02:52:05,630 --> 02:52:06,150
I can't...

3585
02:52:06,150 --> 02:52:09,910
Cosmic, coyote, snake, many, thank you for the superchat.

3586
02:52:10,150 --> 02:52:10,370
Thank you.

3587
02:52:10,650 --> 02:52:11,850
No, you don't understand.

3588
02:52:12,430 --> 02:52:13,950
I was... I... I could!

3589
02:52:14,290 --> 02:52:14,950
I... Oh!

3590
02:52:19,170 --> 02:52:21,770

02:52:22,470 --> 02:52:22,990
Thank you.

3593
02:52:23,190 --> 02:52:25,610
He fucking walked away.

3594
02:52:26,170 --> 02:52:27,870
I am some fucking.

3595
02:52:31,390 --> 02:52:32,550
All right, here we go.

3596
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:35,230
I was doing so well, too.

3597
02:52:39,290 --> 02:52:40,390
Here I am.

3598
02:52:44,690 --> 02:52:46,250
Oh my god, that's fine.

3599
02:52:47,570 --> 02:52:48,490
That's fine.

3600
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:57,520
Okay, that's fine.

3601
02:52:58,600 --> 02:53:00,140
Oh fuck, that's not fine!

3602
02:53:04,780 --> 02:53:05,400
Okay.

3603
02:53:08,220 --> 02:53:09,280
Okay, that's fine.

3604
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:16,300
Oh my god.

3605
02:53:16,700 --> 02:53:17,520
Am I safe?

3606
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:18,500
I think I am.

3607
02:53:20,560 --> 02:53:22,120
Oh, I'm not safe!

3608
02:53:25,710 --> 02:53:27,110
Oh, what the fuck?

3609
02:53:29,070 --> 02:53:30,030
Oh my god.

3610
02:53:30,270 --> 02:53:32,150
Oh my god, the stupid fire.

3611
02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:37,150
Oh my god, the stupid lava!

3612
02:53:39,290 --> 02:53:40,310
I got lava.

3613
02:53:45,850 --> 02:53:46,910
Okay, thank god.

3614
02:53:52,700 --> 02:53:54,020

Okay.

3622
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:23,060
Oh my god, I'm like trying to figure this out.

3623
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:24,400
Oh no.

3624
02:54:26,420 --> 02:54:27,040
Oh my god.

3625
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:28,780
Oh my god, not the lava.

3626
02:54:29,560 --> 02:54:31,440
Not the goddam...

02:56:02,890 --> 02:56:03,650
I'm not okay.

3647
02:56:03,870 --> 02:56:05,210
Guys, a message of praise, please!

3648
02:56:05,430 --> 02:56:06,250
Message of praise!

3649
02:56:06,470 --> 02:56:06,750
No!

3650
02:56:10,290 --> 02:56:12,030
They were so close!

3651
02:56:14,810 --> 02:56:16,210
Us!

3652
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:22,900
No humble combo!

3653
02:56:26,100 --> 02:56:28,020
I got combos!

3654
02:56:29,200 --> 02:56:30,660
It's so hard!

3655
02:56:31,540 --> 02:56:33,080
Oh my god!

3656
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:38,540
I can't...

3657
02:56:39,240 --> 02:56:40,440
Okay.

3658
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:41,940
Oh!

3659
02:56:43,080 --> 02:56:44,120
Make reset.

3660
02:56:45,150 --> 02:56:49,020
Because someone would be proud of the amount of orange being shown here.

3661
02:56:50,360 --> 02:56:51,520
Okay, now...

3662
02:56:51,520 --> 02:56:54,620
Now I accidentally drank the flask.

3663
02:56:56,320 --> 02:56:57,100
For your...

3672
02:57:07,800 --> 02:57:08,260
My one.

3673
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:08,920
My zero.

3674
02:57:09,540 --> 02:57:09,760
Ruins.

3675
02:57:10,820 --> 02:57:12,040
Thank god for that.

3678
02:57:25,950 --> 02:57:25,970
Shit.

Oh shit!

3680
02:57:27,750 --> 02:57:29,910
Oh shit!

3681
02:57:30,690 --> 02:57:31,550
Nice.

3682
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:37,760
Nice.

3683
02:57:38,300 --> 02:57:41,120
I feel like I'm gonna die by lava any moment.

3684
02:57:47,450 --> 02:57:48,330
Okay.

3685
02:57:49,150 --> 02:57:49,770
Okay.

3686
02:57:49,770 --> 02:57:50,090
Okay.

3687
02:57:50,090 --> 02:57:50,230
No!

3688
02:57:50,910 --> 02:57:51,950
Oh thank god!

3689
02:57:52,130 --> 02:57:52,370
Oh!

02:57:52,610 --> 02:57:52,810
Please!

3691
02:57:58,730 --> 02:57:59,770
Oh thank god!

3692
02:58:01,610 --> 02:58:02,950
Oh thank god!

3693
02:58:03,670 --> 02:58:04,770
I was scared.

3694
02:58:05,070 --> 02:58:05,950
Okay, that was scary.

3695
02:58:07,830 --> 02:58:08,450
Okay.

3696
02:58:10,370 --> 02:58:12,570
That was a little too close.

3697
02:58:13,090 --> 02:58:14,550
That was a little...

3698
02:58:18,070 --> 02:58:19,310
Guys, I chose it!

3699
02:58:19,630 --> 02:58:21,010
Guys, I chose it!

3700
02:58:23,640 --> 02:58:24,680
Okay, there we go.

3701
02:58:26,420 --> 02:58:27,380
Holy shit.

3702
02:58:31,700 --> 02:58:32,220
Oh!

3703
02:58:38,120 --> 02:58:38,880
We did it!

3704
02:58:39,020 --> 02:58:39,500
We lived!

3705
02:58:45,360 --> 02:58:47,060
Let's be getting like two hits.

3706
02:58:47,220 --> 02:58:47,960
I don't know why.

3707
02:58:47,960 --> 02:58:49,120
Thank god.

3708
02:58:49,120 --> 02:58:49,180
Thank god.

3709
02:58:51,460 --> 02:58:52,340
Oh my god.

3710
02:58:52,500 --> 02:58:52,720
Thank god.

3711
02:58:54,040 --> 02:58:55,100
Oh shit!

3712
02:59:01,220 --> 02:59:02,460
Oh my god.

3713
02:59:04,300 --> 02:59:04,660
Okay.

3714
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:09,780
Okay, I need to back up a little.

3715
02:59:15,530 --> 02:59:15,890
Alright.

3716
02:59:16,810 --> 02:59:17,450
I healed.

3717
02:59:21,400 --> 02:59:22,040
Come on!

3718
02:59:22,260 --> 02:59:23,140
Get out of here!

3719
02:59:23,840 --> 02:59:24,540
Yeah!

3720
02:59:28,030 --> 02:59:28,630
That's right!

3721
02:59:33,730 --> 02:59:34,790
That's not me.

3722
02:59:38,090 --> 02:59:38,750
That's...

3723
02:59:38,750 --> 02:59:39,650
Honestly, I deserve that.

3724
02:59:40,410 --> 02:59:42,370
I fucking deserve that so much.

3725
02:59:42,570 --> 02:59:43,630
Oh my god!

3726
02:59:44,540 --> 02:59:44,870
Oh!

3727
02:59:45,490 --> 02:59:46,650
Where am I?

3728
02:59:47,230 --> 02:59:47,890
Where...

3729
02:59:47,890 --> 02:59:48,970
Where am I?

3730
02:59:49,170 --> 02:59:50,110
Where am I?

3731
02:59:59,220 --> 03:00:00,980
Welcome to hell!

3732
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:03,460
Holy shit.

3733
03:00:03,820 --> 03:00:04,940
Holy shit!

3734
03:00:05,300 --> 03:00:05,720
Holy shit!

3735
03:00:05,720 --> 03:00:06,420
Oh my god!

3736
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:08,780
Oh my god!

3737
03:00:08,960 --> 03:00:09,600
Welcome to

3738
03:00:14,230 --> 03:00:14,730
hell...

3739
03:00:15,490 --> 03:00:16,270
I'm okay.

3740
03:00:17,270 --> 03:00:17,970
I'm okay.

3741
03:00:18,550 --> 03:00:19,910
There's just...

3742
03:00:19,910 --> 03:00:27,950
A little bit of a flesh wound Just a... just a little bit.

3743
03:00:28,990 --> 03:00:32,730
Just... just a minor flesh wound, everybody.

3744
03:00:35,630 --> 03:00:36,470
Oh!

3745
03:00:41,510 --> 03:00:42,350
Ow!

3746
03:00:43,470 --> 03:00:44,150
Ow, many!

3747
03:00:44,710 --> 03:00:45,970
Oh my god!

3748
03:00:47,350 --> 03:00:49,030
How many is there?

3749
03:00:56,760 --> 03:00:58,480
Oh my god!

3750
03:00:59,280 --> 03:01:00,480
Oh my god!

3751
03:01:00,740 --> 03:01:00,980
Oh my god!

3752
03:01:00,980 --> 03:01:03,060
I'm living by a thread right now!

3753
03:01:10,770 --> 03:01:14,190
My... my death was greatly exaggerated.

3754
03:01:17,980 --> 03:01:18,660
Ah!

3755
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:23,340
Oh my god!

3756
03:01:23,560 --> 03:01:24,340
Oh my god!

3757
03:01:24,780 --> 03:01:25,240
Oh my god!

3758
03:01:25,240 --> 03:01:26,080
Oh my god!

3759
03:01:26,080 --> 03:01:29,340
Power of 70 hours!

3760
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:31,460
Holy shit!

3761
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:38,560
I should not be alive!

3762
03:01:38,860 --> 03:01:41,620
Oh, I should not be alive right now!

3763
03:01:43,640 --> 03:01:45,160
We did it!

3764
03:01:45,160 --> 03:01:46,060
Oh!

3765
03:01:46,940 --> 03:01:48,080
That's right!

3766
03:01:48,780 --> 03:01:50,660
No together for you!

3767
03:01:51,560 --> 03:01:55,460
That's fuck the power of Doki and the dragoons!

3768
03:01:56,640 --> 03:01:58,160
Let's let it go!

3769
03:01:58,620 --> 03:02:01,300
I should not be alive right now!

3770
03:02:01,640 --> 03:02:03,060
You have a snake?

3771
03:02:03,060 --> 03:02:05,500
I have 40 health bars!

3772
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:07,180
Okay, what do we...

3773
03:02:10,940 --> 03:02:13,340
Okay, what do we do?

3774
03:02:14,060 --> 03:02:15,540
Oh my god!

3775
03:02:16,240 --> 03:02:18,420
Laughing, thank you for the super chat!

3776
03:02:18,560 --> 03:02:19,480
Thank you, thank you!

3777
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:21,280
No one will keep me captive!

3778
03:02:21,940 --> 03:02:23,800
A serpent never dies!

3779
03:02:24,500 --> 03:02:25,760
Kevin, thank you for the super chat!

3780
03:02:25,900 --> 03:02:26,740
Thank you, thank you!

3781
03:02:26,740 --> 03:02:29,720
Now you know you can't take credit for that!

3782
03:02:29,880 --> 03:02:32,760
The appraisals won that battle!

3783
03:02:33,220 --> 03:02:34,880
Zyko, thank you for the super chat!

3784
03:02:34,980 --> 03:02:35,940
Thank you, thank you!

3785
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:37,960
We appraised this together!

3786
03:02:39,160 --> 03:02:40,680
Saber, thank you for the super chat!

3787
03:02:40,820 --> 03:02:42,060
Thank you, thank you!

3788
03:02:42,380 --> 03:02:43,720
Doki probably...

3789
03:02:43,720 --> 03:02:44,820
Where am I?

3790
03:02:44,920 --> 03:02:45,820
Why am I here?

3791
03:02:46,140 --> 03:02:47,880
How am I still alive?

3792
03:02:48,900 --> 03:02:49,920
Okay, we'll do...

3793
03:02:51,060 --> 03:02:52,180
Holy shit!

3794
03:02:52,420 --> 03:02:54,680
That is five levels worth of...

3795
03:02:54,680 --> 03:02:55,220
Oh my...

3796
03:02:55,220 --> 03:02:57,020
Did we just go all the way to 25?

3797
03:02:57,580 --> 03:02:58,100
For endurance?

3798
03:02:59,240 --> 03:03:00,540
Together, my dragon!

3799
03:03:02,560 --> 03:03:04,540
Thank you for the super chat state!

3800
03:03:05,140 --> 03:03:06,200
Thank you, thank you!

3801
03:03:07,700 --> 03:03:09,300
Space, thank you for the super chat!

3802
03:03:09,420 --> 03:03:10,260
Thank you, thank you state!

3803
03:03:10,260 --> 03:03:13,100
Got a 25 hit combo on you!

3804
03:03:13,580 --> 03:03:14,300
What do I do two?

3805
03:03:15,040 --> 03:03:15,980
Two on endurance?

3806
03:03:16,300 --> 03:03:16,900
And then...

3807
03:03:16,900 --> 03:03:17,840
What else do I need?

3808
03:03:18,580 --> 03:03:20,100
What else do I need after that?

3809
03:03:20,500 --> 03:03:20,940
Got it!

3810
03:03:22,640 --> 03:03:23,740
Good job chat!

3811
03:03:23,960 --> 03:03:24,880
We beat the boss!

3812
03:03:24,880 --> 03:03:26,380
Ha ha ha ha!

3813
03:03:29,140 --> 03:03:29,980
Oh, laughing!

3814
03:03:30,160 --> 03:03:30,940
Thank you for the super chat!

3815
03:03:31,120 --> 03:03:31,880
Okay, dexterity?

3816
03:03:32,100 --> 03:03:33,040
And then we can put...

3817
03:03:33,040 --> 03:03:33,880
Two on dexterity...

3818
03:03:34,860 --> 03:03:36,240
And then what after that?

3819
03:03:36,840 --> 03:03:37,800
What do we do after that?

3820
03:03:38,200 --> 03:03:39,020
An arcane?

3821
03:03:39,160 --> 03:03:40,260
And then we'll put one more on arcane.

3822
03:03:40,400 --> 03:03:40,880
Here you go!

3823
03:03:41,600 --> 03:03:42,240
Here you go!

3824
03:03:43,860 --> 03:03:44,700
Holy fuck!

3825
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:47,580
That's fucking crazy!

3826
03:03:47,580 --> 03:03:51,900
That was a fucking crazy boss fight we had!

3827
03:03:52,380 --> 03:03:53,800
Holy shit!

3828
03:03:58,230 --> 03:03:59,450
Oh my god!

3829
03:03:59,630 --> 03:04:00,350
Get this...

3830
03:04:00,350 --> 03:04:01,650
God damn...

3831
03:04:01,650 --> 03:04:02,870
Sword out of here!

3832
03:04:03,410 --> 03:04:04,190
Ha ha ha ha!

3833
03:04:08,390 --> 03:04:12,930
Okay, now I can use the stupid fucking katana that I built!

3834
03:04:15,850 --> 03:04:17,390
This isn't streamer luck!

3835
03:04:17,670 --> 03:04:18,830
This is streamer earned!

3836
03:04:19,330 --> 03:04:19,690
Ruben!

3837
03:04:19,750 --> 03:04:20,570
Thank you for the super chat!

3838
03:04:20,690 --> 03:04:20,950
Thank you!

3839
03:04:21,070 --> 03:04:21,630
Thank you!

3840
03:04:23,290 --> 03:04:23,650
MrBrokenFile!

3841
03:04:23,730 --> 03:04:24,610
Thank you for the super chat!

3842
03:04:24,730 --> 03:04:25,030
Thank you!

3843
03:04:25,170 --> 03:04:25,750
Thank you!

3844
03:04:26,610 --> 03:04:27,950
Well done, Doki!

3845
03:04:28,150 --> 03:04:29,110
You make it look...

3846
03:04:29,110 --> 03:04:31,470
So easy with the ADL bars!

3847
03:04:31,750 --> 03:04:33,430
We did it together!

3848
03:04:34,230 --> 03:04:35,230
Ha ha ha ha!

3849
03:04:37,350 --> 03:04:38,910
Thank god, chat!

3850
03:04:39,430 --> 03:04:42,270
We spent so long upgrading our two swords!

3851
03:04:45,010 --> 03:04:46,070
I did it!

3852
03:04:46,110 --> 03:04:46,710
It's true then!

3853
03:04:47,370 --> 03:04:48,510
Now I'm your lord!

3854
03:04:48,810 --> 03:04:50,130
You defeated our lord!

3855
03:04:50,770 --> 03:04:51,330
No!

3856
03:04:52,830 --> 03:04:54,470
I must thank you!

3857
03:04:55,950 --> 03:04:57,770
Our lord was yet weak!

3858
03:04:57,910 --> 03:04:58,310
That's right!

3859
03:04:58,430 --> 03:04:59,690
I'm your new lord now!

3860
03:05:00,910 --> 03:05:02,410
Defeat is not the end!

3861
03:05:03,270 --> 03:05:05,190
Our lord is immortal!

3862
03:05:05,610 --> 03:05:07,730
I'm the new daddy of this fucking hell!

3863
03:05:07,850 --> 03:05:08,090
Exactly!

3864
03:05:09,050 --> 03:05:09,590
Stronger!

3865
03:05:09,990 --> 03:05:10,750
Until then...

3866
03:05:11,710 --> 03:05:13,750
I must stay the path...

3867
03:05:14,270 --> 03:05:15,750
And do my part!

3868
03:05:18,690 --> 03:05:19,490
Wait, what?

3869
03:05:19,690 --> 03:05:20,710
What do you mean, go back?

3870
03:05:22,850 --> 03:05:24,880
What even is that area that fucking...

3871
03:05:24,880 --> 03:05:25,520
fucking good?

3872
03:05:26,760 --> 03:05:27,920
Go back here?

3873
03:05:34,020 --> 03:05:35,060
What's around here?

3874
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:36,200
Nothing here!

3875
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:43,360
Nothing here, guys!

3876
03:05:46,580 --> 03:05:47,120
What?

3877
03:05:54,710 --> 03:05:56,470
Oh, I didn't finish the die of that!

3878
03:05:56,550 --> 03:05:56,750
Whoops!

3879
03:05:56,890 --> 03:05:57,390
I didn't...

3880
03:05:58,490 --> 03:05:59,750
I got too excited!

3881
03:06:00,490 --> 03:06:00,950
Baby!

3882
03:06:01,130 --> 03:06:01,870
Thank you for the super chat!

3883
03:06:01,990 --> 03:06:02,210
Thank you!

3884
03:06:02,330 --> 03:06:02,830
Thank you!

3885
03:06:03,430 --> 03:06:04,970
Congrats on defeating Swordsnake!

3886
03:06:05,390 --> 03:06:07,950
I got gifted a Doki high case for my birthday!

3887
03:06:08,210 --> 03:06:09,170
May I have a happy birthday, please?

3888
03:06:09,310 --> 03:06:09,830
Oh my god!

3889
03:06:09,950 --> 03:06:11,290
Happy birthday to you!

3890
03:06:12,310 --> 03:06:13,930
Happy birthday to you!

3891
03:06:14,290 --> 03:06:16,030
Happy birthday, dear koala!

3892
03:06:16,470 --> 03:06:17,810
Happy birthday to you!

3893
03:06:18,770 --> 03:06:19,070
Yeah!

3894
03:06:19,630 --> 03:06:20,150
Happy birthday!

3895
03:06:20,150 --> 03:06:20,290
Yay!

3896
03:06:20,710 --> 03:06:21,990
I hope you enjoy your high case!

3897
03:06:22,290 --> 03:06:23,670
Shines all the more.

3898
03:06:24,050 --> 03:06:26,250
I always was an admirer.

3899
03:06:27,470 --> 03:06:28,070
Oh, nice.

3900
03:06:28,550 --> 03:06:29,850
Alright, now we go back.

3901
03:06:31,850 --> 03:06:33,130
I have a great birthday!

3902
03:06:36,930 --> 03:06:38,130
Okay, oh, there he is.

3903
03:06:39,390 --> 03:06:40,330
Oh, look at him.

3904
03:06:40,430 --> 03:06:41,810
Oh, it's just a face now!

3905
03:06:41,810 --> 03:06:44,850
Oh, she's crying at his head!

3906
03:06:45,310 --> 03:06:46,630
Oh, you...

3907
03:06:46,630 --> 03:06:47,090
Eh!

3908
03:06:47,770 --> 03:06:48,890
Allow me some time.

3909
03:06:49,710 --> 03:06:51,730
Our Lord's carcass is vast.

3910
03:06:52,250 --> 03:06:53,190
And not easily...

3911
03:06:53,190 --> 03:06:54,750
Are you like eating his head?

3912
03:06:55,090 --> 03:06:57,470
Dear Rikard, please...

3913
03:06:57,470 --> 03:07:00,170
Find purchase within me.

3914
03:07:00,210 --> 03:07:01,270
Oh my god, she's not...

3915
03:07:01,270 --> 03:07:02,710
I wish to be your servant.

3916
03:07:04,010 --> 03:07:04,630
Your family.

3917
03:07:04,990 --> 03:07:05,390
Together.

3918
03:07:06,590 --> 03:07:08,830
Let us devour the gods.

3919
03:07:08,830 --> 03:07:10,650
Oh, you ate half his head already?

3920
03:07:10,650 --> 03:07:11,070
What?

3921
03:07:11,430 --> 03:07:11,610
Jesus!

3922
03:07:11,830 --> 03:07:13,090
How hungry were you?

3923
03:07:13,790 --> 03:07:15,270
So hungry.

3924
03:07:15,890 --> 03:07:16,930
She was...

3925
03:07:17,410 --> 03:07:19,710
She was so hungry, guys.

3926
03:07:20,050 --> 03:07:22,410
Dear Rikard, please...

3927
03:07:22,410 --> 03:07:25,170
Find purchase within me.

3928
03:07:25,430 --> 03:07:27,730
I wish to be your serpent.

3929
03:07:28,450 --> 03:07:29,510
Your family.

3930
03:07:29,970 --> 03:07:30,750
Do I kill her now?

3931
03:07:31,530 --> 03:07:34,470
Let us devour the gods together.

3932
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:35,990
Wait, I have to kill her?

3933
03:07:36,230 --> 03:07:36,590
Why?

3934
03:07:37,630 --> 03:07:38,590
Cause she's weird?

3935
03:07:39,190 --> 03:07:39,630
Guys.

3936
03:07:39,850 --> 03:07:41,950
We can't just kill every weird person in this world.

3937
03:07:42,470 --> 03:07:42,630
Guys.

3938
03:07:42,830 --> 03:07:43,970
Then they can't be VTuber.

3939
03:07:49,310 --> 03:07:49,750
Alright.

3940
03:07:52,870 --> 03:07:53,550
Oh.

3941
03:07:57,910 --> 03:07:58,590
Oh.

3942
03:07:58,590 --> 03:07:58,890
Oh.

3943
03:07:58,890 --> 03:07:58,930
Okay.

3944
03:07:59,210 --> 03:07:59,550
Bye.

3945
03:08:00,190 --> 03:08:01,010
Oh shit!

3946
03:08:01,230 --> 03:08:01,370
What?

3947
03:08:01,630 --> 03:08:01,990
What?

3948
03:08:02,330 --> 03:08:02,410
What?

3949
03:08:03,450 --> 03:08:04,130
Ah!

3950
03:08:04,370 --> 03:08:05,310
You fuckers!

3951
03:08:05,610 --> 03:08:06,610
You fuckers!

3952
03:08:11,110 --> 03:08:11,710
You are me?

3953
03:08:11,710 --> 03:08:12,970
Oh my god!

3954
03:08:14,110 --> 03:08:14,950
Okay, die.

3955
03:08:15,230 --> 03:08:15,830
You fuckers.

3956
03:08:15,930 --> 03:08:16,930
You actual fuckers.

3957
03:08:18,210 --> 03:08:19,630
Oh my god!

3958
03:08:19,850 --> 03:08:20,010
Oh my god!

3959
03:08:20,010 --> 03:08:20,230
You ...

3960
03:08:20,230 --> 03:08:21,090
Boowo.

3961
03:08:21,150 --> 03:08:21,950
Oh my god!

3962
03:08:22,230 --> 03:08:23,010
You bated me!

3963
03:08:23,210 --> 03:08:24,870
You fuckers bated me!

3964
03:08:28,340 --> 03:08:29,600
Oh my god.

3965
03:08:29,600 --> 03:08:32,400
Oh, my God.

3966
03:08:34,900 --> 03:08:37,040
Oh, my God.

3967
03:08:40,060 --> 03:08:41,400
Holy shit.

3968
03:08:41,940 --> 03:08:42,700
Oh, my God.

3969
03:08:42,820 --> 03:08:44,240
I thought it was... Can I leave?

3970
03:08:44,900 --> 03:08:45,520
Oh, no.

3971
03:08:45,620 --> 03:08:46,520
Where's the grays?

3972
03:08:47,300 --> 03:08:47,860
Wait.

3973
03:08:48,280 --> 03:08:48,500
Wait.

3974
03:08:48,700 --> 03:08:49,020
Maybe.

3975
03:08:49,380 --> 03:08:49,960
Maybe.

3976
03:08:50,220 --> 03:08:51,480
I see the tunnel.

3977
03:08:52,020 --> 03:08:52,680
Maybe.

3978
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:53,940
Oh, my God.

3979
03:08:53,940 --> 03:08:54,580
I can leave.

3980
03:08:54,980 --> 03:08:55,820
Oh, my God.

3981
03:08:55,820 --> 03:08:56,520
I can leave.

3982
03:08:56,760 --> 03:08:58,820
Get... Wait.

3983
03:08:58,820 --> 03:09:00,320
Oh, my God.

3984
03:09:01,380 --> 03:09:02,820
There's a grays right here.

3985
03:09:03,580 --> 03:09:04,220
Oh, my God.

3986
03:09:07,640 --> 03:09:09,360
You didn't get me.

3987
03:09:11,960 --> 03:09:13,680
You thought you got me.

3988
03:09:13,940 --> 03:09:15,600
You thought you got me there.

3989
03:09:20,380 --> 03:09:21,660
That's a grays.

3990
03:09:23,220 --> 03:09:24,480
I love it.

3991
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:25,820
Fight.

3992
03:09:26,140 --> 03:09:26,260
Wait.

3993
03:09:26,340 --> 03:09:27,260
I think he's gone forever.

3994
03:09:28,400 --> 03:09:29,260
Oh, shit.

3995
03:09:29,300 --> 03:09:29,480
Wait.

3996
03:09:29,620 --> 03:09:30,000
She's gone.

3997
03:09:31,800 --> 03:09:33,540
I bravely ran away.

3998
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:34,500
Oh, shit.

3999
03:09:34,680 --> 03:09:35,420
Oh, shit.

4000
03:09:37,500 --> 03:09:38,220
Okay, wait.

4001
03:09:41,180 --> 03:09:42,580
Oh, my God.

4002
03:09:43,060 --> 03:09:44,780
Guys, I don't know if I can kill him.

4003
03:09:50,690 --> 03:09:51,190
Okay.

4004
03:10:02,850 --> 03:10:05,030
And then she bravely...

4005
03:10:05,030 --> 03:10:05,250
No!

4006
03:10:18,230 --> 03:10:22,170
I just grabbed my roots back.

4007
03:10:23,850 --> 03:10:24,790
Bravely what?

4008
03:10:25,130 --> 03:10:25,610
Doki?

4009
03:10:26,850 --> 03:10:27,450
Bravely...

4010
03:10:28,050 --> 03:10:30,630
She bravely died.

4011
03:10:30,630 --> 03:10:30,790
What?

4012
03:10:31,270 --> 03:10:32,150
What?

4013
03:10:32,690 --> 03:10:33,210
Bravely what?

4014
03:10:34,370 --> 03:10:35,870
Okay, we'll do one more.

4015
03:10:36,110 --> 03:10:37,430
We'll do one more.

4016
03:10:42,150 --> 03:10:42,810
Let's see.

4017
03:10:44,470 --> 03:10:45,350
Hit.

4018
03:10:52,710 --> 03:10:53,330
Ah!

4019
03:10:54,650 --> 03:10:55,430
Ah!

4020
03:11:06,350 --> 03:11:06,970
Ah!

4021
03:11:07,250 --> 03:11:07,570
Ah!

4022
03:11:07,570 --> 03:11:07,650
Ah!

4023
03:11:13,810 --> 03:11:13,930
Ah!

4024
03:11:13,950 --> 03:11:14,830
Sad.

4025
03:11:19,800 --> 03:11:21,740
Alright, we get out of here.

4026
03:11:22,180 --> 03:11:23,460
We leave now.

4027
03:11:29,700 --> 03:11:33,820
Okay, we grab our runes and we bravely run away.

4028
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,420
We bravely run away.

4029
03:11:45,940 --> 03:11:49,260
Let's just grab this and then...

4030
03:11:49,260 --> 03:11:50,020
Goodbye.

4031
03:11:50,620 --> 03:11:51,160
Goodbye.

4032
03:11:52,440 --> 03:11:54,200
Legend of brave Doki.

4033
03:11:55,040 --> 03:11:55,480
Alright.

4034
03:11:56,280 --> 03:11:57,940
I don't know where to go now.

4035
03:11:58,920 --> 03:11:59,980
Just go here.

4036
03:12:00,360 --> 03:12:00,560
No?

4037
03:12:01,460 --> 03:12:03,220
No, I think... you know what?

4038
03:12:04,040 --> 03:12:05,680
That's a story boss, right?

4039
03:12:06,100 --> 03:12:08,160
Was he a story boss, guys?

4040
03:12:08,360 --> 03:12:09,860
Where the fuck am I, actually?

4041
03:12:10,820 --> 03:12:12,140
Oh my god.

4042
03:12:12,520 --> 03:12:13,720
Where did I go?

4043
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:15,800
Where did I go?

4044
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:18,920
It was... alright, we caught it there.

4045
03:12:19,240 --> 03:12:20,720
Okay, this is a good time to call it.

4046
03:12:20,840 --> 03:12:21,320
We did it.

4047
03:12:21,500 --> 03:12:23,600
We finally finished our beach episode.

4048
03:12:23,760 --> 03:12:23,860
What?

4049
03:12:24,240 --> 03:12:24,640
Come on.

4050
03:12:24,960 --> 03:12:25,340
Come on.

4051
03:12:25,760 --> 03:12:26,000
What?

4052
03:12:27,080 --> 03:12:27,540
What?

4053
03:12:27,800 --> 03:12:28,200
Come on.

4054
03:12:28,540 --> 03:12:29,340
Come on for y'all.

4055
03:12:29,920 --> 03:12:30,200
Huh?

4056
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:32,600
I don't know why he's barking.

4057
03:12:33,840 --> 03:12:34,400
But...

4058
03:12:35,620 --> 03:12:36,180
But...

4059
03:12:36,180 --> 03:12:37,000
But we're gonna...

4060
03:12:37,420 --> 03:12:38,140
We're gonna...

4061
03:12:38,140 --> 03:12:38,780
We're gonna...

4062
03:12:38,780 --> 03:12:39,840
We're gonna call it here.

4063
03:12:40,060 --> 03:12:40,520
We...

4064
03:12:43,380 --> 03:12:44,920
I don't know why he's barking.

4065
03:12:45,480 --> 03:12:46,520
Uh... I don't know...

4066
03:12:46,520 --> 03:12:47,380
Okay, he's optional.

4067
03:12:47,500 --> 03:12:48,960
He's a story boss in my...

4068
03:12:48,960 --> 03:12:49,840
In my heart!

4069
03:12:50,420 --> 03:12:52,220
He was a story boss!

4070
03:12:52,220 --> 03:12:53,440
In my heart!

4071
03:12:55,760 --> 03:12:57,380
Oh, and then he walked away.

4072
03:12:57,620 --> 03:12:58,720
He's like, oh shit.

4073
03:12:58,940 --> 03:12:59,680
She's mad.

4074
03:13:01,700 --> 03:13:02,540
Anyway, guys.

4075
03:13:03,180 --> 03:13:04,980
I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

4076
03:13:05,720 --> 03:13:06,200
Um...

4077
03:13:06,200 --> 03:13:07,460
I have a lot of work to do today.

4078
03:13:07,720 --> 03:13:08,720
And also, tomorrow.

4079
03:13:09,060 --> 03:13:10,460
And also, uh...

4080
03:13:10,460 --> 03:13:12,640
All the days before my actual birthday stream.

4081
03:13:12,980 --> 03:13:13,740
But anyway, guys.

4082
03:13:13,740 --> 03:13:14,880
I hope you guys...

4083
03:13:15,340 --> 03:13:15,700
All...

4084
03:13:15,700 --> 03:13:16,880
Had a great time watching.

4085
03:13:17,780 --> 03:13:19,680
It was a very long filler episode.

4086
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:21,720
Today and...

4087
03:13:21,720 --> 03:13:22,260
Two days ago.

4088
03:13:22,600 --> 03:13:23,040
But...

4089
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:24,000
As always, everybody.

4090
03:13:24,540 --> 03:13:25,420
Stay hydrated.

4091
03:13:25,780 --> 03:13:26,360
Posture check.

4092
03:13:26,560 --> 03:13:27,460
Get up and move around.

4093
03:13:27,580 --> 03:13:28,520
To get that blood flowing.

4094
03:13:28,680 --> 03:13:29,280
And if you...

4095
03:13:29,280 --> 03:13:29,900
Stay up for me.

4096
03:13:30,060 --> 03:13:30,720
Head to bed.

4097
03:13:30,820 --> 03:13:31,260
Cause...

4098
03:13:31,260 --> 03:13:32,020
You deserve it.

4099
03:13:32,180 --> 03:13:33,460
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4100
03:13:33,520 --> 03:13:35,120
I'm glad we fixed the stutter issue.

4101
03:13:35,220 --> 03:13:36,600
I wish I fixed it earlier.

4102
03:13:36,980 --> 03:13:37,800
I wish I...

4103
03:13:37,800 --> 03:13:39,020
I wish I...

4104
03:13:40,300 --> 03:13:40,740
I...

4105
03:13:40,740 --> 03:13:41,960
Did the fix...

4106
03:13:41,960 --> 03:13:43,400
Like, the newest fix earlier.

4107
03:13:43,400 --> 03:13:46,200
But like, I hope the studies weren't too bad.

4108
03:13:46,460 --> 03:13:46,860
Uh...

4109
03:13:46,860 --> 03:13:47,800
During this playthrough.

4110
03:13:48,100 --> 03:13:48,800
But now it's...

4111
03:13:48,800 --> 03:13:49,720
Now we don't get any.

4112
03:13:49,820 --> 03:13:50,420
So that's good.

4113
03:13:50,660 --> 03:13:51,120
Hey, guys.

4114
03:13:51,260 --> 03:13:52,160
I'll see you guys later, everyone.

4115
03:13:52,360 --> 03:13:52,900
Bye, guys.

4116
03:13:53,320 --> 03:13:53,720
Bye!
