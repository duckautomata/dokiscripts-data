00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,880
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,140
Yes, I have revoked your right to rewind because I forgot to do that.

3
00:03:45,200 --> 00:04:58,100
The last couple of days I've been having my staff help me make my waiting room because I get like after the stream I have work to do and then I keep forgetting to make the waiting room but then I got too EP and I was like I'll be like I'll be like at staff can someone make my waiting room I'm too bed too comfy I'm like bed too comfy someone make waiting room I sleep here is thumbnail and because of that I keep forgetting because like every time when I make the waiting room I turn the rewind off so like it's just a habit so I don't have to worry about turning it off when I start the stream but like today like obviously like that's why I keep forgetting to turn off rewind because my staff has last three days because I would do work and then I'd be like I'm gonna lie in bed and I'm like oh bed comfy me no one could get up at staff someone make waiting room because you can't do it on the phone I don't understand I feel like the mobile YouTube creator app should allow you to make a waiting

4
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:07,280
room on your phone because my laziness knows no bounds I don't want to get out of my bed waiting room.

5
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,220
I wish I could just do it on my phone.

6
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,500
Uh, like, I don't understand.

7
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,280
We live in 2025.

8
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,140
Why can't I make my waiting room?

9
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,060
On my phone.

10
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,120
Then you will never get up.

11
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,180
Like, someone has, I still didn't get up.

12
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,460
I still didn't get up.

13
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,060
I literally went at steps.

14
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,780
Someone make my waiting room.

15
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,700
Like, it doesn't matter.

16
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,300
I still didn't get up.

17
00:05:35,600 --> 00:06:51,880
I just let my staff make it instead um oh yeah and i saw um today i saw the i saw the fortnite tesla car uh like i got it i don't know what it's called i don't know the actual name you know the one where it's like it shouldn't be a car it doesn't look like a car you know what it's i don't even know what it's called it's like it's like the it's like that tesla card in fortnite what is it called i don't know what it's called i really got my only knowledge of that car is that it's in fortnite the the cyber truck yeah i saw two cyber trucks in real life today i is i felt like it's like spotting the lockness monster i saw i saw two assholes today of us because i'm like it's so ugly like you know like you know okay when you see it in real life it's a lot uglier in person i legitimately i'm sorry if anyone actually owns a cyber truck i am so sorry but it is actually ugly in real life I yeah yeah it is it's like it shouldn't even be a car I'm it's so bulky too it's like it's like really big

18
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:09,980
for no reason and it just it doesn't need I just doesn't even look aesthetically pleased I don't understand is it supposed to be like for safety like why does it look like that like why I saw it too too I The thing is I don't understand like the yeah,

19
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:19,080
it looks like it looks like it's at like like 50 polygons or some shit I just don't understand I hear it explodes, right?

20
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,440
Like what are the benefits of having the car shaped like that?

21
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:54,880
It's futuristic thinking you don't and it's supposed to reflect the future I would assume in the future you want a pretty car It doesn't mean like in the future You just lost all sense of fashion like I'm just saying like you just lost like you just lost like the ability to see what looks good or not I that doesn't make sense to me like You just suddenly lost your like ability to comprehend what looks appealing or not in the future

22
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,480
But no it's actually it's so like you would think it's ugly like you're like oh it might look better in like in person

23
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:55,080
looks a lot worse it's and it's so bulky for no fucking reason too i feel like there's no like actual like protection benefits to having a car look that ugly anyway today we're gonna play uh a lot a lot more holiday night today this is our silk song waiting room i can't believe it's coming up technically it's coming on less than a week on thursday right yeah it's coming on thursday i'm so excited because i've been having a great time playing holiday i don't think we're completing it today but most likely we'll do one more part next week and then think will be good to go for a silk song so i'm really excited anyway let me boot up silk song or not silk song hollownay let me boot up hollownay right now all right guys among us

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,460
Oh, yeah, the double jump is a jetpack look.

46
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,740
Fog Canyon.

47
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,300
Where the fuck is that?

48
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,560
Deep Nester Fog Canyon?

49
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,280
Both of them sound Equally terrible.

50
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,940
One has the fog.

51
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,080
And then the other one is deep.

52
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,680
So I assume it's very dark.

53
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
So both of them sound very terrible equally.

54
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,180
Oh, I can beat the game today.

55
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,120

oh just because i'm from London.

164
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,300
Doesn't mean I'm sus.

165
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,280
Everyone in London stabs people.

166
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,820
Alright, it's this way.

167
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,880
I have the right to hold a knife.

168
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,130
Okay, bro.

169
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,130
True.

170
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,670
I have rights.

171
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,350
Okay.

172
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,850
Okay, go this way.

173
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:45,570
What the fuck?

174
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,810
Oh my god, these guys are so tanky.

175
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,970
Oh, and they...

176
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,870
Okay, it's a good thing I didn't stay there.

177
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,370
Oh my god, these guys are actually so annoying.

178
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,910
Alright, injecting.

179
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,670
Go and play trauma center.

180
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,670
Playing trauma center real quick.

181
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,950
Oh, these guys are so annoying, though.

182
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,970
Oh, I can't beam yet.

183
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,350
Okay.

184
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,830
Alright, nice.

185
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,190
You'll be fighting a lot of bosses to get steady body from Salubra.

186
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,690
It makes your attacks more consistent.

187
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,530
Let's see position easily.

188
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,330
Who Salubra?

189
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,430
Is she Salubra?

190
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,030
Oh, steady body.

191
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,350
Where and you'll be able to stay firmly when swinging your little nail around.

192
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,590
Wait, why do I have to stay?

193
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,150
Oh, so I don't get ricocheted?

194
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,370
I mean, I'll buy it for now.

195
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,010
I don't know about use it, but I'll just buy it for now.

196
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,250
Wait, why can't I buy this?

197
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,850
I'm not...

198
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:46,990
What?

199
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,310
Wait, why won't they let me purchase it?

200
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,230
I need...

201
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,810
Wait, what?

202
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,190
Oh.

203
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,190
Oh, I need 18 charms!

204
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,090
Wait, how many do I have?

205
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,610
I can't read.

206
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,510
You guys know that.

207
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,570
1, 2, 3, 4...

208
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,030
Wait, how does this say?

209
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:17,050
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

210
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,090
Okay, we have 13.

211
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,710
Yeah, exactly.

212
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,130
It's the London handshake.

213
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,450
I'm being restricted from my culture.

214
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,690
I'm being judged for my culture.

215
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,250
Okay, where do we go then?

216
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,470
Okay, guys, where do we go?

217
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,610
I need help.

218
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,170
I beat the Beatles.

219
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,030
Oh, I'm 17.

220
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,110
I literally need one.

221
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:49,550
Okay.

222
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,210
What's the closest charm?

223
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,950
I mean, I feel like if we go to a new area, we'll find a charm.

224
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,330
Dirt mouth, go left.

225
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,630
Wait, left.

226
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,390
Right from King Station.

227
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,250
Okay, which way?

228
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,410
Oh, I could have just bought one.

229
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,290
Oh, wait, you're right.

230
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,530
Wait, you're right.

231
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,790
I could have literally just bought another charm.

232
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,110
Okay, I'm going back.

233
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,150
I mean, I can afford it, technically.

234
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,310
I'll just buy another charm.

235
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,600
See, I can read at a first grade level.

236
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,640
I just want to go in and go out.

237
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,660
No, I just need one.

238
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,940
I still need more?

239
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,920
I just needed one.

240
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
Oh, I need five more.

241
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,560
Oh, I'm not giving you more of my money.

242
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,340
Fuck that shit.

243
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,020
Never mind.

244
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,980
I'll find...

245
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,200
What?

246
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,220
How did he...

247
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,360
Oh, they explode.

248
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:56,760
Okay.

249
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,560
I was gonna say, how the fuck did they explode?

250
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,140
Oh my god, I hate these.

251
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,460
These guys are actually so annoying.

252
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,820
Alright, I have to get used to being in Among Us 2.

253
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,700
A crewmate.

254
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,220
I have to get used to it.

255
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,720
I guess.

256
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,980
Because it's a different hitbox.

257
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,820
Well, it's not a different hitbox, but like, I need to remember where my hitbox is as a crewmate.

258
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,480
Alright, we go.

259
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,520
We go get to the station and then go to...

260
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,140
Okay, do we go to dirt map or the royal area?

261
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,620
Or what the fuck it's called?

262
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,680
Is that it?

263
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,860
Alright, do we go?

264
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, what the fuck?

265
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,420
Oh, I didn't even see them.

266
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,140
Wait, what the fuck?

267
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,240
Where the fuck is the exit?

268
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,960
Dirt map or the...

269
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,840
No, it doesn't change the hitbox.

270
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,440
It just fucked with me.

271
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,200
Wait, what?

272
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,580
Oh, the exit's blocked.

273
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,740
Wait, they blocked it.

274
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,500
How the fuck do I get there?

275
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,320
Wait, they blocked the area.

276
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,580
That's not legal.

277
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,280
They're doing construction.

278
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,440
I gotta go around.

279
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,100
I can't believe it.

280
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,700
They didn't notify me that there was... They were doing construction over there.

281
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,780
That's it.

282
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,120
I'm gonna contact my local government.

283
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,160
My taxpayer money is not paying for this.

284
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,650
Alright, I need... I'm just going to go to the other station.

285
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,610
It's tradition to block the path due to construction.

286
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,350
Just like Quebec.

287
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,790
And then they're like... And then the construction workers go on strike.

288
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,830
You can have your path, your road again.

289
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,990
Just like France.

290
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,450
I heard that's like a big issue in France.

291
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,530
Where the construction, there'll be construction.

292
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,030
And then like the workers would just go on strike.

293
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,530
And it happens like every couple of months.

294
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,990
Now you're getting it.

295
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,910
Roads get finished in Quebec.

296
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,830
Alright, we go this way.

297
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,950
That sounds fun.

298
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,730
Okay, we go right.

299
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,230
Which way?

300
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,070
I feel like we already went through everything here.

301
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,890
Like the resting ground, right?

302
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,170
Oh, down in, right?

303
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,850
The king's state.

304
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,610
Oh, there?

305
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,110
Here?

306
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,250
The old stack station?

307
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,090
The other construction area?

308
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,000
Hidden path here?

309
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Nope, not here.

310
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:08,940

But he's just...

315
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,420
Just flying.

316
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,960
Fuck you, I don't like that.

317
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,460
He's just chilling there.

318
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,560
And it's like, I don't like that.

319
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,100
I guess you're just gonna have to die.

320
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,220
What's this?

321
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,280
Oh, another journal.

322
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,660
He was just bro.

323
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,860
He was just mining his own business.

324
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,340
He was just a regular guy.

325
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,100
It's a traveler.

326
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,420
It's weird.

327
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,800
What the fuck?

328
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,120
Where did he drop from?

329
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,050
Oh, I can dream now the corpses.

330
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,070
Whoops, too late.

331
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,410
Is it here?

332
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,150
Oh shit.

333
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,510
How the fuck do I get across?

334
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,950
I'm just gonna go down for now.

335
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,170
Oh, like this corpse?

336
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,670
No, not like this corpse.

337
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,520
Oh, I hear somebody.

338
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,260
Below me.

339
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,860
Oh, there he is!

340
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,740
No, but fuck that guy in particular.

341
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,040
Okay, is it here?

342
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,920
There's a little gap here.

343
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,160
Oh, I knew it.

344
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,680
Oh, the cornea.

345
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,500
This is just a cozy place.

346
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,700
I've been mentioning about that wilderness beside here and thought a moment's freak was a little called for.

347
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,820
The night sky, you are out of your near the side of the city, but the entirety is here as ferocious as ever.

348
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,840
All right, I'll buy your map.

349
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,160
Buy your map DLC.

350
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,040
All right, city.

351
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,560
Okay, we gotta go down and then right.

352
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,100
That's right.

353
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,840
Making the nerd richer.

354
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,260
It's like, like, don't bully nerds or they're gonna become knights.

355
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,280
Tech CEOs.

356
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,770
There's nothing here.

357
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,870
So I guess we'll just go this way.

358
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,290
Why is it raining men?

359
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,320
Yeah, he's got an expensive way.

360
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,600
Where are these?

361
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,740
Oh.

362
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
Oh, I don't like that.

363
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,920
Okay, so these guys just jump.

364
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,980
He just jumped, but now they did.

365
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,500
Can I go?

366
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,460
Is there anything up here?

367
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,320
Okay, I literally can...

368
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,840
Okay, so they don't...

369
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,140
What I've realized is that they actually don't take any damage.

370
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,200
Like, they don't take...

371
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,960
There's no... What's it called?

372
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,240
Throwback?

373
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,040
You don't have knockback.

374
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,720
Yeah, there's no knockback on them.

375
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,160
I don't like that.

376
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,400
What the fuck?

377
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,000
What the fuck?

378
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,940
Where did you come from?

379
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,590
Oh, and now they're gone?

380
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,790
Where the fuck did these guys come from?

381
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,110
from.

382
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,190
Yeah, there's no knockback on these guys.

383
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,650
Oh my god, of course!

384
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,130
Get out.

385
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,030
Lads.

386
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,090
Oh, I don't... Oh, this is bad.

387
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,770
This is actually very bad.

388
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,090
Whoa.

389
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,570
No!

390
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,290
No!

391
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,270
No!

392
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,190
The one shot!

393
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:07,850
Oh!

394
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,690
Okay, how far am I?

395
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,610
How far?

396
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,530
Okay, it's not that far.

397
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:14,790
Wait.

398
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,430
Where am I?

399
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,130
Wait, actually, where am I?

400
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,450
Wait, why is my compass gone?

401
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,010
Now where am I?

402
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,150
Wait, how am I- Oh my god!

403
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,710
Okay, it's okay.

404
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,210
I forgot to sit on the chair.

405
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,120
Accident removed it.

406
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,660
And I forgot to...

407
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,120
I forgot to take- get on my chair.

408
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
I forgot to bench and do the other stuff.

409
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,260
I keep forgetting the bench.

410
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,250
Down I'll go.

411
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,090
Down I'll go.

412
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:03,850
No benches?

413
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,210
Okay, let's just...

414
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:07,850
Wait, what?

415
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,170
Do I have to kill them?

416
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:09,910
Oh, okay.

417
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,490
I was like... Jesus.

418
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,590
I need to make sure not to get hit by those guys.

419
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,390
Come on.

420
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,110
Okay.

421
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,710
These guys take two damage, and I don't like that.

422
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,590
All right.

423
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,750
Now I gotta figure out where my body is.

424
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,310
Where's my body?

425
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,270
Oh shit.

426
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,240
Okay, it's on this side.

427
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:51,510
Yeah.

428
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,350
There we go.

429
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,570
There we go.

430
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,010
Become one with me.

431
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,110
Fuck you!

432
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,470
Oh, that's not instant kill.

433
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,010
Okay, there is, like, slight knockback.

434
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:09,970
That's good to know.

435
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,490
Alright.

436
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,570
Where do I have to go?

437
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,410
Let's go far right so I can get the bench.

438
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,910
It's just not that obvious.

439
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,000
I want to make sure I'm full HP.

440
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,680
There has to be, like, a charm somewhere.

441
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,740
need just five more charms.

442
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,460
Technically, I can get two and just buy three charms from her.

443
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,160
I could try and buy cheaper.

444
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,820
Okay, wait.

445
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,220
Actually, I'm going to go to the bench.

446
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,180
I'm going to go to the bench first.

447
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
Maybe I'll find a vent to get to the bench.

448
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,540
You have a lot of money, so I can technically just pay to win.

449
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,560
Oh, shit.

450
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,780
Oh, shit.

451
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,120
Okay.

452
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,540
It's okay.

453
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,880
Oh, he got the...

454
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,440
I said it'd be like, it's okay.

455
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,440
He can't make it.

456
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,200
He's too short.

457
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,140
I forgot.

458
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,240
He can jump guys

459
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:29,540
He's just slowly getting into my aura too, which helps It was not I was gonna be like ha ha I have the high ground you can't reach me there And then he like jumped and I was like oh, oh, yeah, you could do that

460
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,170
My aura

461
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:43,290
Jesus Oh my god.

462
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,210
Alright, nice.

463
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,390
I just want to make sure I'm consistently full HP.

464
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,620
Oh, these guys are so annoying!

465
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:00,820
Alright.

466
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,590
The fact that they just follow you, instead of like, going in a pattern, too.

467
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,190
Get my bench.

468
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,290
Oh, is that a bench?

469
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,730
Ooh, this is a fancy bench.

470
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,770
A fancy bench for a fancy crewmate.

471
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:20,770
Hello?

472
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,450
Who's here?

473
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,090
How did you find me?

474
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,910
Down here, where the world ends.

475
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,790
Yes, I know why you're here.

476
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,790
You came to learn a nail art from the legendary nail master, Oro.

477
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:45,750
It is a lot of great nail sage that I must pass down my teaching to those who are worthy.

478
00:32:47,150 --> 00:33:01,870
law forbids me from extracting a exacting a payment for my time you truly wish to train under me prove it with geo they're in the master's nail art sure surely this is not a scam right

479
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,490
who's that guy

480
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:20,790
hold the car oh i get a charge it's like who's that guy that's trading over him that's not me That's John Hollenight.

481
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,730
We banished him.

482
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,770
All right, cons truly sublime on dashing to perform the dashed lies.

483
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,910
Hell a summit.

484
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,270
I must say, you are an excellent pupil.

485
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,750
Your skill with a nail and your thirst to become stronger.

486
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,930
You remind me of my brothers.

487
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,590
I've taught you all I can.

488
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,830
into the world, Traveler, and leave me to my solitude.

489
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,270
Alright, goodbye.

490
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,730
Sorry about my aura.

491
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,050
How do I do it?

492
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,610
Let's do this.

493
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,070
Wait, what?

494
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,670
How do I...

495
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,130
How does this attack work?

496
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,270
Oh, charge and dash... Oh, so when I do this, this is attacking?

497
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,050
Is that it?

498
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,150
Oh.

499
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,510

00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,530
Wait, how do...

00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,930
Charge, dash, let go.

00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:28,330
Oh!

503
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,470
Okay.

504

Okay, I got it.

505
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,710
Okay.

506
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,430
How come I didn't let me do it before?

507
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,010
Oh, because I didn't let go.

508
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,070
Okay, I had to time it correctly.

509
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,070
Okay.

510
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,730
I get it.

511
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,370
I just gotta time it correctly.

512
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,710
Hello?

513
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,210
Who's this guy?

514
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,470
Dream, dream, dream, dream.

515
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,550
Stronger, brothers.

516
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,470
So you...

517
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,610
It looks like you have a fire cloud following around.

518
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,490
Simple-minded.

519
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,530
Thank you for the super chat.

520
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:06,890
Thank you.

521
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,590
Thank you.

522
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,270
Dream!

523
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:10,890
Oh, okay.

524
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:11,490
That's it.

525
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,550
Enough dreaming.

526
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,810
Do you get a secret?

527
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:15,530
Keep hitting it?

528
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:15,970
Okay.

529
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,930
Did I dream it?

530
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,480
like normal hit it.

531
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,650
Surely something will happen, right?

532
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,210
Oh.

533
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,410
Hey, guys.

534
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,870
Oh!

535
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,450
Oh!

536
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:35,970
Okay.

537
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,640
Okay, I knew it.

538
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,070
That's okay.

539
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:41,570
Wait.

540
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:42,950
Wait, that's okay.

541
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:43,750
Oh, shit!

542
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,230
But I could literally just see you.

543
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,230
You're too thick!

544
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,550
Ha, ha, ha!

545
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,670
I'm gonna check some more.

546
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,870
What was that medicine that Dr. House uses all the time?

547
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,510
It's not lupus.

548
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,300
Oh, hey.

549
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,060
Where's those?

550
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,070
Oh.

551
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,270
Vicodin?

552
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,730
Yeah, I'm checking if I could get it on me.

553
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:18,870
Alright, let's see.

554
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,210
Oh, gosh.

555
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:19,850
It's a bench.

556
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,190
It's never lupus, guys.

557
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,010
Alright, we go this way.

558
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,970
I need to practice this move.

559
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,190
I feel like...

560
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,870
This move is hard to use.

561
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,470
There's two of them!

562
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,090
Ha ha ha!

563
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,970
Oh, wait, how did you get here?

564
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,770
Oh my god, he really wants to kill me.

565
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,110
How do I...

566
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,650
Oh my gosh, I'm so bad with this move.

567
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:49,750
Like, oh!

568
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,870
Nah, I'm not gonna use it.

569
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,770
I, like, I think it's a strong move, but I'm just so bad at using it.

570
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,720
Can you actually...

571
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,680
miss the charm?

572
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,780
Was it back there?

573
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,860
Or is it back here?

574
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,660
Where's the charm?

575
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,050
Ground?

576
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,230
The floor?

577
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,960
There's a breakable floor?

578
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,980
Oh, there it is.

579
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,300
Yeah.

580
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:37,640
Oops.

581
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,100
Mike, thank you for five.

582
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,780
Give the ships.

583
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,160
Thank you.

584
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,840
Thank you.

585
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,620
That's it.

586
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,800
There's nothing else.

587
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,480
Oh, here.

588
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,100
God, these guys are so annoying.

589
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,280
Okay, at the moment, the current most annoying enemy is this guy.

590
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:04,940
Oh.

591
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,480
Spoiler break.

592
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,560
Well, I hear a grub.

593
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,240
Okay, where the fuck did you guys come from?

594
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,680
No, I gotta kill this guy.

595
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,720
He cannot live.

596
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,340
That's fine.

597
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,660
I'll tank all of this.

598
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,220
I'm okay.

599
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,600
I'm okay with tanking it, y'all.

600
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,170
Currently the most annoying enemy at so far.

601
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
Get out of here.

602
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,540
Alright, there is a breakable down.

603
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,600
Oh, it's a rocket!

604
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,740
Oh, fuck!

605
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,700
I didn't realize.

606
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,640
There's so many spikes!

607
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:13,240
Oh my god, I'm landing in all the spikes I'm actually landing on all of it I can't I can't

608
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:30,580

He won.

611
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,180
Okay.

612
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,540
He's gonna attack this guy, though, just in case.

613
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:45,920
He won.

614
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,560
He knew.

615
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,160
Oh, my God.

616
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,700
I've got to get you out of here.

617
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:54,880
Terrain.

618
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,480
The final boss.

619
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,340
Wait.

620
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,240
What's this?

621
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,340

How is there two now?

632
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,650
Did they multiply?

633
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,390
I don't know what to do.

634
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,470
He's so scary.

635
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,470
I don't...

636
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,350
Oh, go back.

637
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:32,970
Why?

638
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,050
I freed him.

639
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,510
Is there a breakable floor that I'm missing?

640
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,460
Here?

641
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,360
Through the right of the spikes.

642
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,480
Oh, he...

643
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,480
Oh, I see it.

644
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:01,940
Where am I?

645
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,580
Oh.

646
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,940
Okay.

647
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,020
Oh my god, this is like a whole maze.

648
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,780
Natural maze right here.

649
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,880
Okay, money.

650
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,420
Is that it?

651
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,480
Oh, this way.

652
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,570
Okay, so there's something...

653
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,130
Okay, nice, I knew it.

654
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,510
Okay, never mind.

655
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:34,450
It does nothing.

656
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,810
I was like, I knew it.

657
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,550
Never mind.

658
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:39,710
It's nothing.

659
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,630
Is there anything here?

660
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,690
Just got baited?

661
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,690
There's like so many holes, but there's nothing in these holes.

662
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,930
Oh, I need to try them to read that.

663
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,910
Okay, I was gonna say, like, why is there nothing here?

664
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,690
Go down, I'll go.

665
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,670
Holy shit, this is a long-ass tunnel.

666
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,660
Can I go down again?

667
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,480
Oh, there's another little hole here.

668
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:17,740
Anything?

669
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,980
No, that's just bait.

670
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:19,780
Okay.

671
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,240
It's just all bait.

672
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,500
That's all right.

673
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,560
It's all right.

674
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,360
I've been baited so many times.

675
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,780
It's okay, I'm used to it now.

676
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,800
Uh-oh.

677
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,980
That's a lot of money.

678
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,380
It feels like a trap somehow.

679
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,140
Hmm.

680
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,140
I don't think...

681
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:48,580
It just feels a little too easy how there's just money there lying in this giant hole.

682
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,500
Wait, that's it?

683
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,440
Wait, that's it.

684
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,340
Oh.

685
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,920
It could just be that easy?

686
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,500
Yeah, it feels pretty sus.

687
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,120
Wait, it can actually...

688
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,240
Life can just be that easy?

689
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,740
No.

690
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,640
That can't be.

691
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,280
Life shouldn't be easy.

692
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,840
I can just get a hand up just like that.

693
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,160
No traps.

694
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,420
No bosses.

695
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,580
No flanks.

696
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,540
No ambush.

697
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,820
What is this building?

698
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,520
I know, 420 Geo.

699
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,120
Besides the three deaths, it took to get it.

700
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,440
Alright.

701
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,000
How do we go this way?

702
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,460
You mean I don't need to work for my money?

703
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,040
I can just have it hand out to me?

704
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,020
Oh my god.

705
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,920
I get to be a Nepo baby.

706
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:01,780
Let's go.

707
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,860
Wait, what's over here, though?

708
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,300
I never go in this side before.

709
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,750
Okay, nothing here.

710
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,050
God, I hate this guy so much.

711
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,030
Oh, and of course I missed.

712
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:27,510
It's okay.

713
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,430
It's not okay.

714
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,510
I didn't think that would hit me.

715
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,390
I'll just stay here.

716
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,010
Nah.

717
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:37,570
my aura.

718
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:41,370
Okay, not now, though.

719
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,750
God damn it.

720
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:44,310
God damn it.

721
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,130
Okay, come to my aura.

722
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,920
Okay, I'm just getting hit by all of it.

723
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,240
By all the misses.

724
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,220
I'm at.

725
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,740
That's right.

726
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,120
Oh my god, wait, I didn't get hit by that.

727
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:03,900
Nice.

728
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,340
Alright.

729
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:20,640
So nice Okay, I sort of don't like the aura talisman Only because sometimes I can't see the missiles Because it's literally the same It's almost the same color

730
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:41,270
So anybody gives extra hits on those guys plus bosses Oh boy, I like that Okay, maybe I'll swap it then I'll swap it Because I'm getting annoyed I'm getting annoyed because like They're both orange So it's, they're both like blending in

731
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,780
Okay, let's get first before...

732
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,210
All right.

733
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:52,590
But it's funny!

734
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,770
I can't see!

735
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,570
It can be funny, but I'm blind right now.

736
00:47:59,110 --> 00:47:59,850
All right, quick slash.

737
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:01,270
What's that?

738
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:04,990
Uh, slash, oh.

739
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,670
Is it funny when I'm blind?

740
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,470
That's a surprise for a bit.

741
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,630
Comedy is suffering.

742
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:19,410
Doki.

743
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,130
Just like how beauty is pain.

744
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,960
Alright, where am I?

745
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,300
I'm here.

746
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,900
Alright, let me... I'll swap then.

747
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,500
I'll swap just to...

748
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,080
I'm gonna swap then.

749
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,780
Jesus Christ, there's three of them.

750
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,780
Alright, get over here.

751
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,340
Okay, I guess not.

752
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,940
I'm going to swap the charms.

753
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:52,020
I'm going to swap this for...

754
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:52,620
What was it, SETI?

755
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,810
Yeah, no.

756
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,930
These guys are very annoying.

757
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,010
At least I can heal, though.

758
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,110
At least it gave me 30 for a hit, which is nice.

759
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,330
You can't even pogo it, too.

760
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,310
That's the worst part.

761
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,400
Alright.

762
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,160
That gives you a regenerating health.

763
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:26,440
Oh, I...

764
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,180
I like that.

765
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,780
I like regenerating health.

766
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,460
What the fuck?

767
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:33,820
Okay.

768
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,500
I got your nose.

769
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,300
Alright, let's see.

770
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,200
We go left.

771
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,530
Oh, so that's where they come from.

772
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:50,650
Okay, I see.

773
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:53,490
So I was, like, wondering how the little guys kept spawning in.

774
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:55,650
Here we go up, then.

775
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:21,160

779
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:14,880
Wait, maybe?

780
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,620
Oh, I knew it.

781
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,360
Oh, fucking curse.

782
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:20,920
Oh, my God!

783
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:21,440
I'm fucking...

784
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,940
Okay, I'm just gonna free you first.

785
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:25,940
Oh, my God!

786
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,640
Just hit me!

787
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,840
Just hit every fucking shot on me.

788
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,200
Okay.

789
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,300
I knew there was a grub there.

790
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,180
Okay.

791
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,580
I'm just gonna heal up.

792
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,060
What else is here?

793
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,540
Okay, I think I can pogo this?

794
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,400
Like, the small guys are easier to pogo.

795
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,280
But the big boys, the big boys are a little frustrating.

796
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,960
The small guys, like, is easier.

797
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,980
The big guy is just a little too big.

798
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,000
He's, like, too tanky for the pogo.

799
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,520
What hit me?

800
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,580
What hit me from the...

801
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,160
God just fucking threw a rock at me?

802
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,500
Where did that come from?

803
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:35,880
There.

804
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,060
Did he?

805
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,880
Oh, Mimi.

806
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,600
It did not seem like he shot me earlier.

807
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,080
Maybe I should have been shooting up.

808
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,840
Gamers usually can't look up.

809
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,120
I don't know where to go.

810
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,180
I'll go left first.

811
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:53,760
Oh, wait.

812
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,020
Left is...

813
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,440
Oh, left is just...

814
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:56,840
Okay.

815
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,100
Left is just this.

816
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,840
Wait, how did I not get there before?

817
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,680
I said I jumped here.

818
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,440
Yeah, the difficulty spike is crazy.

819
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,480
Ever since they added spikes, it's all downhill for me.

820
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,680
Alright, this way.

821
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,280
Oh, it's her.

822
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,100
Okay, I'm not going there.

823
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,980
Yeah, I was gonna say...

824
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,100
I feel like I got I gotta fight Silk Song.

825
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,660
Jane Silk Song soon.

826
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:45,740
Let me go.

827
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,820
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the bench.

828
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,540
I was like, oh yeah.

829
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,000
No, I'm most likely gonna fight her if she's trying to lead me somewhere.

830
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,880
This is this.

831
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,140
Okay, I knew it.

832
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,070
Oh, no, no, no, Jerno.

833
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:03,710
Can I slash him?

834
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,990
The slash trapped.

835
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,310
That's it?

836
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,470
Came all the way here for you to just say that.

837
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,890
Like, if you're gonna die, die at least with more of an essay.

838
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,430
Alright, we got the bench.

839
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,770
So that means it's time to fight Adidas.

840
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:29,650
Alright, six song time.

841
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,810
I did say it was a six song waiting room.

842
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,490
Make it worthwhile to read your story.

843
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,790
Alright, let me take a hydrate real quick.

844
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,770
It took me, it only took me an hour to read.

845
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:46,650
this fucking map.

846
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,050
Quick slash is good.

847
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,450
I don't know how to use quick slash effectively.

848
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,150
I feel like I'm really bad with it.

849
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,230
So you pursue the deeper truth.

850
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:10,550
So stupid.

851
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,690
I look so stupid here.

852
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,610
Oh, quick slash is the charm.

853
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,450
So you pursue the deeper truth.

854
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,810
This isn't one week.

855
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,120
one the weak could bear.

856
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,640
Prove yourself ready to face it.

857
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,960
I'll not hold back.

858
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,740
My needle is lethal.

859
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,120
Now I feel no sadness in the weakling's demise.

860
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,740
Because I don't know if I could first try this.

861
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,020
I feel like today's made me not my day.

862
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:50,000
Show me you can accept this kingdom's past and claim responsibility for its future.

863
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,200
Oh,

864
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,640
I forgot all her moves, by the way.

865
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,480
I don't remember any of her moves.

866
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:03,880
Okay.

867
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,540
Give me a sec.

868
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,460
I'm trying to remember what your moves are.

869
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,100
Okay.

870
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,040
Oh my god.

871
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,060
Yeah, I'm not first trying her.

872
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,720
I don't remember how she moves at all.

873
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:49,430
I think it's a it's a wait what what what is that wait can I go past that do something I was so confused I was like what are those moves okay she lays okay Okay, now I know.

874
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,970
Sorry, I was enamored by her beauty.

875
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:56,130
Oh, it's fine.

876
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,310
We don't need those charms.

877
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,490
I can slash them?

878
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:00,770
Oh, okay.

879
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:01,890
Oh hey, there's me.

880
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:02,570
Ow!

881
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:03,950
What the fuck?

882
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,690
I keep forgetting that I hurt myself.

883
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,050
Oh, she can parry.

884
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,560
Okay.

885
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,240
She's a lot faster.

886
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,960
No, she's 100% lot faster than before.

887
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,220
Adidas!

888
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:41,670
Alright.

889
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:44,090
We gotta focus.

890
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:45,770
Adidas!

891
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,970
She's so much faster.

892
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:54,650
Can I heal?

893
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:55,810
Nope.

894
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:00,250
That answers my questions.

895
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:01,610
Can I hear the air?

896
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:02,950
Yeah.

897
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:06,410
Oh, that's bullshit!

898
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,790
Oh, that's so bullshit!

899
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:12,170
Cheater!

900
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:18,410
All right.

901
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:23,690
Oh.

902
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:26,670
Oh, I have to hit the spike!

903
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:29,110
Okay, I thought I could hit the...

904
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,050
I thought I could hit the...

905
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,590
What was it?

906
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,030
Shaw!

907
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,670
Oh shit!

908
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,110
This truly is a hard-haired silkside.

909
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,350
Spikes, my worst enemies!

910
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,330
Yeah, I thought I could just hit the strands.

911
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,030
I was like, why isn't my...

912
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,370
Why isn't my knife cutting the rope?

913
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,570
It's made of silk.

914
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,030
It should be the most easy.

915
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:58,710
easily cut up a sting.

916
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,010
Uh, yeah, I'm not healing.

917
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:06,570
Oh my god, I hurt myself.

918
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:12,610
I'm not healing because I keep forgetting like, I don't know when I can heal because of her range.

919
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:18,910
Her range is that messes with me sometimes.

920
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:21,590
Like...

921
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,670
Oh my god!

922
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,010
I'm not playing well.

923
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,370
Today's not my day.

924
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,650
Today's not my day.

925
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,010
I need us.

926
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,410
Are you serious?

927
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,450
That was such a big.

928
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:42,270
Okay.

929
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:44,010
Don't get rage baited.

930
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,110
It's because of Among Us.

931
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:49,790
You gotta be Jane Silk Song.

932
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,850
If you wanna beat it.

933
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,490
Maybe you're right.

934
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:55,990
Maybe you're right.

I must kill myself.

938
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:34,530
Today's my birthday.

939
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:35,350
Can I get a happy birthday?

940
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:36,050
Of course, Rell.

Happy birthday!

950
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,910
Silk saw versus silk saw.

951
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,250
Oh my god.

952
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,730
I'm already feeling it.

953
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,510
I'm feeling it!

954
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,250
I am you!

955
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:03,050
Alright, I'm locking in.

956
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:06,490
Oh, Jesus.

957
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,190
Sometimes, like, that messes me up, too.

958
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:13,450
Adidas!

959
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:17,050
Okay.

960
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:21,890

961
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:23,070
Okay, that's bullshit.

962
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:24,890
That's bullshit!

963
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:25,770
That's it!

964
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,750

01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,560
But she does the back to back Adidas.

984
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:07,690
Yeah.

985
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:15,330

986
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,110
Oh, that's bullshit.

987
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,340
Right.

988
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:25,780
Okay.

989
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,540
I want to get rid of the spikes so at least I have space.

I'm you, but smaller and better.

999
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,520
Sometimes people, they get small.

1000
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,720
It's not the size.

1001
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,160
It's how you use it.

1002
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,600
It's so strong.

1003
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,780
And I'll have you know.

1004
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,380

01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,600
So strong.

1006
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,580
You could do it if you had the will.

1007
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,600
But could you raise your nail once knowing its tragic conception and knowing yourself?

But, uh, uh, smack that.

01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,800
Wait, he's not coming down.

1043

Excuse me, sir.

Oh, my God.

1047
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,400
I think he likes it.

01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,200
Oh, my God.

1049
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,960
You fucking freak it down.

Okay, stop harassing him.

1051
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,380
Okay, it's not harassing if he's enjoying it.

1052
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,240
He paid for his time.

1053
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,720
This is a house call.

1054
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,060
Smack that.

1055
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,260
Smack that.

1056
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,060
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

1057
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:24,440
Yeah, he's laughing.

1058
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,260
What am I...

1059
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,380
What is the secret?

1060
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,400
Is that it?

1061
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,980
Is that the secret?

1062
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,380
smacking his ass?

1063
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:41,960

01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,480
How do I keep going up?

1066
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,640
He's fucking blocking the only way.

1067
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,580
That's the secret?

1068
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:52,680
No, no.

1069
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:53,780
Keep going.

1070
01:10:59,360 --> 01:10:59,960
Whoops.

1071
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,480
That's the secret to smack a giant.

1072
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,780
That's the dev secret.

1073
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:08,780
It's a little Easter egg.

1074
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,980
that devs put in.

1075
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:12,080
You get to slap...

1076
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,660
You get to slap a giant bug's ass.

1077
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,800
What a great secret.

1078
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:27,790
Oh.

1079
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:29,150
What's over here?

1080
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:31,430
Wait, this is new.

1081
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:36,630
Oh, it's just the HP stuff.

1082
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,750
Okay, it's just extra HP.

1083
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:46,750
Wait, that's literally it.

1084
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,070
It was literally...

1085
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,150
That secret was just literally smacking his ass.

1086
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:55,710
Fucking freak.

1087
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:59,210
Wait, I hear him.

1088
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:01,570
Wait, I hear him.

1089
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:02,510
There he is.

1090
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,250
More tiny thing.

1091
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:07,310
You climb high.

1092
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,270
Seek the knowledge of these lands.

1093
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:13,250
This ashen place is grave a worm.

1094
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:18,770
Once told it came to die, but What is death for that ancient being?

1095
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,290
What transformation, methinks?

1096
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:26,130
This failed kingdom, this product of the being spawned from that event.

1097
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:27,750
Wait, that's it?

1098
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:28,950
Is there anything else?

1099
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:33,690
If you thought about my tale, rest is somewhat disturbed.

1100
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:37,170
But I find that sensation not a... Oh!

1101
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:38,090
Look, see?

1102
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:38,790
See?

1103
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:40,290
He liked it!

1104
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,450
He liked it, guys!

1105
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:46,130
I told you he liked it.

1106
01:12:46,330 --> 01:13:05,450
all right he's a freak one prefers mine not to be right it's rather unsettling rather invasive oh he did not consent to that i told you i knew that freak i knew he was a freak

1107
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:14,960
okay where do i go that was it Ow!

1108
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:20,320
Oh my god, I'm lost losing all my hidden- oh my god, I lost it all.

1109
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:21,540
Whoop!

1110
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,200
I lost it all.

1111
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,640
God, so annoying.

1112
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,700
These insects are so annoying.

1113
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,400
Go back out to the main area?

1114
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:32,920
What's the main area?

1115
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:39,640
Oh!

1116
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:47,940
I didn't figure out where to go for, uh...

1117
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,780
Okay, we gotta go up.

1118
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,360
Wait, I forgot where to go for the next story, the story boss.

1119
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,220
Is the Colosseum a story boss?

1120
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,140
Some people are telling me to do the Colosseum.

1121
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,350
I'm just gonna see if I can...

1122
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:14,370
God damn it!

1123
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,030
He's so relentless!

1124
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:19,590
This fucker is so relentless!

1125
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,300
Okay, it's not required for any ending, okay, so we won't have to do it.

1126
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,760
We'll do it another time.

1127
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:33,340
I don't want to focus on doing the story stuff.

1128
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:39,000
It's entirely unnecessary to beat that.

1129
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,180
Then why the fuck did I find myself?

1130
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:41,720
Wait.

1131
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,360
Wait, then why did I come here?

1132
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,780
Guys, what do you need to finish the game?

1133
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,200
It's because it's cool.

1134
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,560
Alright, I heard there's a charm here anyway, so.

1135
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,860
I'm gonna go here for the charm.

1136
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,860
Okay, but what about the basic ending?

1137
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:30,910
Poor Emma.

1138
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,620
Yeah, we have a lot of money.

1139
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,300
Alright, as it gives, good bonuses.

1140
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,460
Yes, thank you, and super chat.

1141
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:43,180
Thank you, thank you.

1142
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:47,460
I want to get close to the basic ending first before we do, like, the extra content.

1143
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:51,460
I'll do the extra content, like, in the future.

1144
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:54,360
I just want to get as close as I can to the basic ending.

1145
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:55,960
Wait, what's this?

1146
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:03,290
Our dream is the mascot.

1147
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,290
Oh, it's the mascot.

1148
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:04,790
Oh, okay.

1149
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:06,170
Do I go down?

1150
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:08,370
What is this?

1151
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,230
Oh, it's the kingdom's edge.

1152
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:14,270
Okay.

1153
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:15,950
Where the fuck is the charm?

1154
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:29,790
So quiet in here.

1155
01:16:43,150 --> 01:17:07,570
whoa what is here ah another war one wants to do is place your mark upon the trial board there's a small fee attached to trial i'm sure a skill to myself will have quite a wealth of you now before you draw your nail i offer one word of quick advice the reward pit just below where others like yourself await your trial i strongly advise using it to rest up before placing your mask.

1156
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:08,830
Oh, and I have no doubt.

1157
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:10,410
I'm a fearsome warrior myself.

1158
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:14,110
Don't go judging me by my size or my current or constraint.

1159
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:15,990
The Colosseum beckons us both.

1160
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:17,650
I'll be back in battle soon.

1161
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,950
Make a contribution and you can enter it.

1162
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:20,130
All right.

1163
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:21,790
No.

1164
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:27,070
No one ever won glory by clinging to the geo.

1165
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:30,530
No.

1166
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:31,730
All right.

1167
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:32,070
Goodbye.

1168
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,170
We'll come back later.

1169
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,710
I don't feel sussy enough for that.

1170
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:40,270
Well, yeah, thank you.

1171
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:40,810
Super chat.

1172
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,150
Thank you.

1173
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:41,870
Thank you.

1174
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:47,910
For basic ending, you need to do one boss, two dreamers, and a hollow night.

1175
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:49,730
Wait, but I'm hollow night.

1176
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:52,790
I mean, we kicked out hollow night.

1177
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,790
We banished John hollow night from this playthrough.

1178
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:58,450
All right, let's go.

1179
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:02,490
Uh, okay, what do we do?

1180
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:10,810
Wait, I just go far, right?

1181
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:18,940
Um, John Holloway is literally on the cover?

1182
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,330
Stop there.

1183
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:27,770
Just having me step over there quickly and bring your Gio with you.

1184
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:28,810
Where's the bench?

1185
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:32,970
Where do I go?

1186
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:33,530
Down?

1187
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:36,230
I'm so confused.

1188
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:42,930
Under?

1189
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:44,270
Under?

1190
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,870
Under?

1191
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,450
What the fuck is this?

1192
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:55,840
Hello?

1193
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,080
Oh, there's the bench.

1194
01:18:59,180 --> 01:18:59,720
Oh, hi!

1195
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,160
Hello!

1196
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,490
But I want to talk to you.

1197
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:10,030
Hell, when you found it, too, then.

1198
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,590
This perfect place.

1199
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:13,710
I'll soon be entering the battle.

1200
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:16,290
Just taking a moment to rest first.

1201
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:18,650
The field could truly challenge me.

1202
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:22,930
I'm hoping this arena presents the sort of weird challenge I'm after.

1203
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:25,630
Alright, how do I get out of here?

1204
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,550
I assume I can climb this.

1205
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:32,210
Okay, I'm...

1206
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:32,350
Oh.

1207
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:33,670
Okay, no.

1208
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:37,790
Wait, how do I get out?

1209
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:42,110
Oh, nice.

1210
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:43,290
Okay, there's a hidden wall.

1211
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:43,770
Thank God.

1212
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:44,310
Oh, hey.

1213
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:45,430
Hello there.

1214
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:48,350
This is not outside.

1215
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:52,430
The other way?

1216
01:19:55,730 --> 01:20:07,370
Secret up and right Up Oh, here There's another secret Hello What's this?

1217
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:24,070
Oh, now I'm out of here Okay Nice Wait, there was never a charm Guys, you lie Where the fuck is this charm?

1218
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:28,990
I was told that there would be a charm.

1219
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:33,560
Oh, hey.

1220
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,300
There's more stones here.

1221
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,660
Oh, it's a Coliseum reward.

1222
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:48,330
Go right?

1223
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,350
Hello there.

1224
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:55,070
Oh, he a little crazy.

1225
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,130
Is that...

1226
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:57,410
Is that bug golem?

1227
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:00,350
What the fuck was that?

1228
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,800
I hear him.

1229
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,160
Yeah, it's bug golem.

1230
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,120
Oh, okay.

1231
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,480
I'll just kill him like that.

1232
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,700
I'll just use magic.

1233
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,620
My precious.

1234
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,100
My precious.

1235
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,900
Just send fireball.

1236
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:33,360
Fireball.

1237
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:36,780
Where did he go?

1238
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:43,590
There we go.

1239
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:46,130
Get down there.

1240
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,830
Okay, I think he's back here.

1241
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:52,490
Oh, shit!

1242
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:53,810
Oh, my God.

1243
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:54,550
Fuck Golem.

1244
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:55,970
He's so smart.

1245
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:58,670
Oh, my God.

1246
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:00,450
Okay, that's fucked up.

1247
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:03,190
You know, at first I thought it was silly.

1248
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:06,210
But now I'm mad.

1249
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:08,970
Yoink, man.

1250
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:09,930
Wait, that's a key.

1251
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:12,350
Wait, this is not...

1252
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:14,270
This is not a charm.

1253
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:16,290
Just a fucking key!

1254
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,770
Alright, what do I do here?

1255
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:26,060
Okay, he's just sleeping.

1256
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,080
He's just eepey.

1257
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:29,660
Wait, is there an ending exit here?

1258
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:36,230
Is there an exit this way or no?

1259
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:41,450
Is that it?

1260
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:43,850
That was the fucking quickest tag of my life.

1261
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:47,950
How the fuck do I get out of here?

1262
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,470
Oh my god, this was it.

1263
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,390
That's everything.

1264
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,110
Alright, beat me up, Scotty.

1265
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,040
Okay, so it's just literally just the Coliseum shit.

1266
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:13,210
Alright, we'll go do this then.

1267
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:17,150
Alright, let's kill at least one of the aliens.

1268
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:20,670
Why the water?

1269
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:22,610
What's the water secret?

1270
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:26,980
Wait, Ben?

1271
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:27,980
Am I getting one guy?

1272
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:32,100
This one person spammed water secret three times.

1273
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,980
Pretending it's like three different people.

1274
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:36,700
So am I getting one guy?

1275
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,240
Yeah, I'm like, please do.

1276
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,660
That's one.

1277
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:46,460
Yeah, this one guy spammed it three times.

1278
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,900
Making me think it's three different people.

1279
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,080
And then I saw the name and it was just one guy.

1280
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,260
All right, let's go.

1281
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,980
Wait, how do I get out of this tunnel?

1282
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:14,730
I'm trying to figure out how to get out of the tunnel.

1283
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:18,370
I think I can buy some charms now.

1284
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:21,870
Oh.

1285
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,530
I'll just climb up from this way.

1286
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:25,530
All right.

1287
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:34,010
Down,

1288
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:39,070
out, go.

1289
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:43,130
No fall damage.

1290
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:44,630
All right.

1291
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:47,450
There's something in a while, but it's not really worth getting now.

1292
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:47,770
All right.

1293
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:48,850
Yes, thank you for the super chat.

1294
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:49,190
Thank you.

1295
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:49,850
Thank you.

1296
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:51,830
All right.

1297
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:56,250
I guess where do we have to go?

1298
01:24:58,670 --> 01:24:59,030
Uh...

1299
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:04,430
Okay, I guess we'll go with Fungal Waste.

1300
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:07,950
You're a queen station to access this guy?

1301
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:09,850
Ancient...

1302
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:11,510
Why Ancient Basin?

1303
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:17,890
Wait, why Ancient Basin instead of Fungal Waste or Deepness?

1304
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,540
What's Acid Skit?

1305
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,280
Okay, we don't have to worry about tree ending yet.

1306
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,380
Which is better?

1307
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:43,700
Okay, we don't have to worry about true ending yet.

1308
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,220
Alright, okay, I'll do what...

1309
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:50,860
Let me do one of the alien bugs, and then we'll go to Ancient Basin, or Basin.

1310
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,400
You want to grab the acid upgrade?

1311
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,160
Okay, I have to?

1312
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:03,400
Okay, I'll go then.

1313
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,660
If I have to get the upgrade.

1314
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,740
then I'll do it.

1315
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:09,480
If it's, like, a requirement.

1316
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,440
Or if it's, like, actually really good.

1317
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:14,960
Uh...

1318
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,880
Do I have a stag beetle for it?

1319
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:18,640
I don't know.

1320
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,540
Let me...

1321
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,700
Keep the rich real quick.

1322
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,420
Oh, fuck.

1324
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,460

Down!

1326
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,220
Down!

1327
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:35,760
Okay.

1328
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,880
Oh, I missed the statulation for it.

1329
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,020
Oh, technically, you don't have to.

1330
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,900
Just rather annoy.

1331
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,880
God damn, stupid anti-Parker!

1332
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:49,640
Where's the mirror?

1333
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:53,040
I need to talk to the mirror to have these spikes removed.

1334
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,980
Okay, I gotta go this way.

1335
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,620
Okay, oh my god, I hate these already so much.

1336
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,500
I don't know how to make it go left or right.

1337
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,240

1338
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,000

Guys, I just can't get my swimsuit wet.

1408
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:14,830
That's why I take it off when I swim.

1409
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:17,210
Alright.

How do I get it?

1413
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:23,850
Oh, it's this way.

1414
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:32,400
I swear, I've just been lost the entire time.

1415
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,700
This place here is just me trying to figure out where I'm at.

1416
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,260
We did one boss in like an hour and a half.

01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:50,350
Here?

1418
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:52,230

01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:02,360
Alright, see, now I learned the bench.

1420
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:05,060
Okay, then we have to go to...

1421
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:05,900
Where was it?

1422
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,340
To the hidden station?

1423
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:12,320
Where the fuck is up?

1424
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:17,710
Okay, so where do we go?

1425
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:20,150
We're in the ancient...

1426
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:22,490
We're in the ancient basin.

1427
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:24,050
Or whatever the fuck is called.

1428
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:25,430
Queen station.

1429
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,930
Sewers for the upgrade?

1430
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:35,450
Or left and dropped down the pit.

1431
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:39,900
Go down?

1432
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:42,220
You were saying for the acid stuff.

1433
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:51,250
Surr upgrade is useless.

1434
01:34:53,190 --> 01:34:53,550
Wait.

1435
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,590
So I'm not supposed to be here?

1436
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,410
Okay.

1437
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:02,210
Acid is unnecessary.

1438
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:03,850
Oh.

1439
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:05,450
Okay.

1440
01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:06,830
Then where do I go?

1441
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:08,390
Queen Station?

1442
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,620
I already fought Broken Kid.

1443
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,160
Isn't that the...

1444
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,080
Wait, isn't Broken Kid in the vessel thing?

1445
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,300
Guys, I'm so...

1446
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,000
Guys, I'm so confused!

1447
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,280
Where do I go?

1448
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,780
Alright, we're in Queen Station.

1449
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,060
Where do I go?

1450
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:37,860
My chat is fighting!

1451
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,280
Stop fighting!

1452
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,100
Stop fighting!

1453
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:51,950
I'm so lost.

1454
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:57,360
for this area.

1455
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:58,240
Then what do I do here?

1456
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,980
I'm fighting more.

1457
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:08,520
What?

1458
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:09,860
That hits me?

1459
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:10,540
Oh my god.

1460
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:13,560
I didn't realize it has like, um, what's it called?

1461
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,700
It had, like, it like, fucking hit me from there.

1462
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:20,620
Go towards, I don't have a map.

1463
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,140
Go towards the mask.

1464
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:26,300
My fucking map doesn't show me anything.

1465
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:27,820
Oh, here?

1466
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:29,620
I assume it's here.

1467
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,480
No, not homing.

1468
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,180
It had like...

1469
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,760
Wait, then how do I do this?

1470
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,480
Ow.

1471
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,320
How do I do that?

1472
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:53,490
Oh, sewers.

1473
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,980
Right side.

1474
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,740
Alright, it has the...

1475
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,500
It has another use either is needed here.

1476
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:12,680
The royal...

1477
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,380
Oh, it's had to go to...

1478
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:15,780
Go to Hidden Station.

1479
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:16,400
Go...

1480
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,280
Okay, two people came super chatted.

1481
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:21,100
Gave me two very different answers.

1482
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:27,420
Two people super chatted back to back.

1483
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:30,400
And they were both very different answers.

1484
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:33,880
I...

1485
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:37,740
Choose...

1486
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,420
one.

1487
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,100
Follow me.

1488
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,840
You need to bet, Toki.

1489
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:45,200
Don't you know how to play among us?

1490
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:50,400
You actually beat a pack of pain in the game before I'll drop an Akasufo when I get paid.

1491
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:52,800
Beat it after I'll drop a Magenta instead.

1492
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:53,200
I'll get paid.

1493

That's right.

1522
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:36,000
This is a hard lesson that your vote doesn't matter in the end.

1523
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:40,400
This is a lesson to all.

1524
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,660
Your vote never mattered.

1525
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,540
I'm already here.

1526
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:50,380

Here?

1536
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:39,500
Wait.

1537
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:41,020
Oh, my God.

1538
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:42,580
I can hear them fucking choking.

1539
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:43,380
Here?

1540
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,280
Is it this?

1541
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:45,980
Right here?

1542
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,460
Guys, is it this?

1543
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,020
Is that what I didn't do?

1544
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:54,500
Okay.

1545
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:54,940
Yeah?

1546
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:56,140
Alright, we'll get it.

1547
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:00,040
Oh shit, did I...

1548
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:02,880
You already went the wrong way.

1549
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:07,640
God, I hate these guys so much.

1550
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:11,500
I actually hate these guys so fucking much.

1551
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:15,040
And then when they pretend to be dead too, that's the worst part.

1552
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,940
Like, she'll never know.

1553
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:21,480
Don't go there.

1554
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,980
It's actually there.

1555
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:27,940
I'm just gonna fly over there because this might be easier.

1556
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:29,140
Oh, shit.

1557
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:32,820
Okay, it's this way.

1558
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:37,960
Lily, thank you for the super chat.

1559
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,020
Thank you, thank you.

1560
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:47,100
Down with the tote heater for democracy.

1561
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,120
Hey, guys, thank you for the super chat.

1562
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,340
Thank you, thank you.

1563
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:52,560
Okay, this is where I never got...

1564
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,000
Okay, so I haven't gotten here.

1565
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:05,840
I won't randomly fly, just in case.

1566
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:13,500
Get this way.

1567
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:21,820
Alright, these bugs are not as annoying after going through whatever the fuck the jumping guys were.

1568
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:36,800
Is this necessary?

1569
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:40,360
I keep going.

1570
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:47,380
Okay, I'm here.

1571
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:55,130
Alright, dash all, oh my god, it's these guys.

1572
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,920
Okay, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1573
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:04,460
I just saw it, I was like, no.

1574
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,900
I was like, cut my life.

1575
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:12,640
I do not have time for that shit.

1576
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,780
Okay, that's fine, actually, that actually works out for me.

1577
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:22,380
I think... No, that's not a grub.

1578
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,260
That's like those little flying fuckers.

1579
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:28,700
Wait, what are they doing here?

1580
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,380
Wait, what the fuck?

1581
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,040
What the fuck was that hitbox?

1582
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:39,800
Oh my god, this is an actual maze.

1583
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:42,420
Oh my god.

1584
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:45,180
This is an actual fucking maze.

1585
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,600
I don't even know if I'm going the right way.

1586
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:57,370
I hear something above me.

1587
01:45:57,690 --> 01:45:58,750
I hear someone laughing.

1588
01:45:59,630 --> 01:45:59,850
Hello?

1589
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:01,510
Oh, hi.

1590
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:06,270
Oh, what a surprise.

1591
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:08,370
It's not often I receive visitors.

1592
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:11,990
It's been so long, ages even.

1593
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:14,910
I just hope my manners haven't left me.

1594
01:46:15,470 --> 01:46:19,930
You've no doubt since my affluence, you're right to yes.

1595
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:23,370
I'm renowned upon the upper cast of hallowness.

1596
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:28,130
was once until those creedins cast me up.

1597
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:30,870
Have you met them, my farmer fellows?

1598
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:32,710
That's them outside.

1599
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:36,330
Their bodies shambly around, all mindless and empty.

1600
01:46:36,910 --> 01:46:40,270
And I'm still alive to witness their pathetic demise.

1601
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:41,230
Oh, she's petty.

1602
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:42,050
I like her.

1603
01:46:42,490 --> 01:46:46,670
I'm just so happy, making me a wonderful thing.

1604
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:47,890
What's that?

1605
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:48,550
Oh, it's shortcut.

1606
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:51,870
Okay, so I have a shortcut now.

1607
01:46:53,930 --> 01:47:23,810
You need a one-up grade or the other and you get one you don't need the other for a normal ending pin think of a super chat thank you thank you she's a petty queen i like that that's right embrace the pettiness okay i went the wrong way so i should not be here then where should i be i was like wondering like why the fuck are there royal royal guards here It's like,

1608
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:25,390
you're only for my money now.

1609
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:27,630
Should have hit it better.

1610
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:30,450
Oh, dream, too late.

1611
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:34,430
No dream now.

1612
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:36,910
I always forget to dream now.

1613
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:41,070
Only those who prove they're on in combat may enter the group beyond.

1614
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:46,250
Yeah.

1615
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:47,910
Yeah?

1616
01:47:51,650 --> 01:47:52,830
I always forget to dream now.

1617
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:53,250
dream nail.

1618
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:54,530
It's just not in my head.

1619
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:56,330
It's not mentally in there.

1620
01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:02,290
Jesus Christ.

1621
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:03,650
There's so many tunnels.

1622
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:05,550
Okay, I clearly can't do that.

1623
01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:06,810
Yeah.

1624
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:09,290
This has to be the upgrade thing that I need.

1625
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:14,800
Oh, wait.

1626
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:15,840
There's a trap.

1627
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:19,680
They're pretty weak, though, for a trap.

1628
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,760
Yeah, like, my nail is so upgraded now.

1629
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:27,980
I was gonna say.

1630
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,880
It's not a very effective trap when our nail is pretty upgraded.

1631
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,940
Alright, is there anything in here?

1632
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:40,100
Whoa, where am I?

1633
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,280
They're just trying their best.

1634
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,040
Oh, is it this?

1635
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:51,700
Yay!

1636
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:52,760
Yay!

1637
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:54,160
Now I can swim in acid!

1638
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,480
Let's go!

1639
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,160
Yippee!

1640
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:04,240
Look.

1641
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:11,300
look even though i'm immune to acid it doesn't mean my spacesuit is

1642
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:28,570
i gotta take off my spacesuit whenever i swim in it who is this i thought we banished john holland night what's this oh it's the trap

01:49:52,350 --> 01:49:53,250
All right, here you go.

1649
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:54,350
Oh, wait.

1650
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:55,350
I forgot about the shortcut.

1651
01:49:55,610 --> 01:49:56,350
I should go to the shortcut.

1652
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:58,410
Oh, what is the shortcut again?

1653
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:59,430
It was like here, right?

1654
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:03,570
It's like here, and then...

1655
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:06,810
Okay, so...

1656
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:08,550
So what you have to do is beat my land.

1657
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:10,590
Trust me, I'm never right.

1658
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:11,870
Thank you, Golden.

1659
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:13,070
Thank you, Super Chat.

1660
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:14,190
Thank you, thank you.

1661
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:19,990
Yeah, I'm like that guy in Rick and Morty that can swim in acid.

1662
01:50:22,430 --> 01:50:23,050
He was okay.

1663
01:50:23,190 --> 01:50:24,150
He was all right in the end, right?

1664
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:25,350
All right, what's the dream now?

1665
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:26,650
Free!

1666
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:31,350
I'm not like this one, or this one when we had to smize the nails of the city guard.

1667
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,590
I'll live here to not live here, too, little girl.

1668
01:50:33,930 --> 01:50:34,970
As I did the other.

1669
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:35,550
Oh, my God.

1670
01:50:35,630 --> 01:50:37,350
She's fucking, she's an evil bitch.

1671
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:38,370
Holy crap.

1672
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:41,690
Holy fuck, she's evil.

1673
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:44,670
Okay, maybe she's petty, petty.

1674
01:50:46,490 --> 01:50:47,090
Dream,

1675
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:51,270
dream, dream, dream, dream.

1676
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:56,570
Bro, hey, I didn't even do anything to you.

1677
01:50:58,510 --> 01:50:59,830
Kind of hot.

1678
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:03,050
Let's see.

1679
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:06,570
Alright, now that I got the thing, I can do...

1680
01:51:07,170 --> 01:51:07,890

1681
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:31,830

01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:50,250
Oh, it is.

1685
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:51,750
Oh yeah, that's why I hated this area.

1686
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:56,730
Wait, I should go back to the bank and get my money back.

1687
01:51:58,230 --> 01:51:58,570
Hello.

1688
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:01,730
How much money do I have?

1689
01:52:01,790 --> 01:52:02,390
Oh, it's 100.

1690
01:52:02,450 --> 01:52:02,690
Never mind.

1691
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:03,410
You can keep it.

1692
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:04,910
I don't really need $100.

1693
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:06,550
Goodbye.

1694
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:12,010
You can keep it.

1695
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:13,950
I'm not that desperate for my 100.

1696
01:52:14,910 --> 01:52:16,090
I'll come back later.

1697
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:23,180
Okay, we gotta go...

1698
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:27,660
This way.

1699
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:32,800
Oh shit.

1700
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:37,280
You didn't even super chat, did you?

1701
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:37,980
Thank you.

1702
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,800
All right, we go this way.

1703
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:42,740
Yay!

1704
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:48,180
Where am I?

1705
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,020
What is this place?

1706
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:52,000
Oh, boy, should I have a map?

1707
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,600
Oh, the Queen's Garden is.

1708
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,420
What does that mean?

1709
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,660
Oh, yeah, I have the Thorn Shit.

1710
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,000
That's why they're getting damaged.

1711
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:08,920
I need Basin to fight.

1712
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,860
But you guys said that I can just fight.

1713
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:11,900
I need one.

1714
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:14,260
Oh, my God.

1715
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,980
She dies and does...

1716
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:16,920
Oh, please!

1717
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,100
Stop firing me!

1718
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,980
Wait, I need Basin for this area.

1719
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,780
Oh my god!

1720
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:26,780
Okay, let me go back.

1721
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:29,160
I swear to God, we are making zero progress.

1722
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:32,260
Oh my god, your body is still there?

1723
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:38,340
I guess I'll go back.

1724
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:47,000
This area is true ending.

1725
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:48,720
Where do I go?

1726
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:55,180
What is a non-optional ending?

1727
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:56,200
Wait.

1728
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:07,060
How do I get to this guy?

1729
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:09,800
I thought I'd go to the fog, yeah, I get to get him.

1730
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:13,060
I don't know what other pathways lead to him.

1731
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:20,440
We're not doing a secret true ending today.

1732
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:25,960
Guys, we don't need to do true endings today.

1733
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,180
Okay, pungal waste.

1734
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,940
How do I get there?

1735
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:36,840
Oh, I see it.

1736
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:37,920
I see it.

1737
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,980
It's like this, right?

1738
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:42,240
Right here?

1739
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:44,360
Okay, there you go.

1740
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:45,500
We figured it out.

1741
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,240
But yes, then thank you for the super chat.

1742
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:48,580
Thank you.

1743
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:49,180
Thank you.

1744
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:49,980
Alright.

1745
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:51,800
Now.

1746
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:54,180
Now, guys, we figured it out.

1747
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,120
Sorry, we were just on episode.

1748
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,500
So 345 of one piece right now.

1749
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:00,180
Don't worry.

1750
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:00,740
No.

1751
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:06,200
All right.

1752
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:10,280
Surely we're going the right way this time.

1753
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:17,720
Whatever is the most recent suggestion is, I think we should do the opposite.

1754
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,860
Nerdy, thank you for the super chat.

1755
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:20,260

01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:53,710
Yay!

1770
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:55,690
Now we have 561.

1771
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:58,230
Oh, I don't like that.

1772
01:57:58,690 --> 01:57:59,670
We're back here.

1773
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:06,730
Oh my god, I forgot!

1774
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:09,890
I forgot they do that.

1775
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:12,510
I'm just like, I'm gonna kill you.

1776
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:16,370
I just wanted to kill them just because I can't.

1777
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:17,750
But I forgot they hurt.

1778
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,400
Okay, let me go this way.

1779
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:28,600
And then we swim, swim, swim, swim.

1780
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:33,460
Now we're at the infected crossroads.

1781
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:35,140
Wherever, where am I?

1782
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:35,940
Wait, I'm here?

1783
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:39,920
Oh, I think I should have went down.

1784
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,900
I'm like, where is this place?

1785
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,580
Yeah, I was like, wait a minute.

1786
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:49,140
I'm out here.

1787
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,160
Oh, it was just a shortcut.

1788
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:53,400
Yeah, I went the wrong way.

1789
01:58:58,410 --> 01:58:59,250
Just gotta make sure I don't.

1790
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:00,450
Ow!

1791
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:01,750
Ow, I hit...

1792
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:03,030
Oh, oh my god!

1793
01:59:03,550 --> 01:59:04,470
Am I okay?

1794
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:04,910
I'm okay.

1795
01:59:07,290 --> 01:59:10,550
I just, like, hit like, five different explosions.

1796
01:59:12,110 --> 01:59:13,290
I think I'm okay.

1797
01:59:13,310 --> 01:59:13,890
Okay guys.

1798
01:59:17,690 --> 01:59:18,730
Okay, that's good.

1799
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:21,150
I needed this.

1800
01:59:22,670 --> 01:59:24,310
A little worry there.

1801
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:28,030
Oh wait, I can swim this.

1802
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:28,690
I don't have to worry.

1803
01:59:32,130 --> 01:59:33,670
I literally can just swim all through this.

1804
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:39,810
Are you serious?

1805
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:43,070
Like how the fuck do I get rid of that?

1806
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:47,170
Oh my god.

1807
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,290
I don't know why I did that again.

1808
01:59:48,830 --> 01:59:50,650
I thought it was further away.

1809
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:54,390
I was like, surely I'm further away now from it, right?

1810
01:59:55,810 --> 01:59:57,790
Sorry, I had to test it again.

1811
01:59:58,250 --> 02:00:00,630
I just don't touch it.

1812
02:00:00,830 --> 02:00:06,550
I was like, but maybe maybe it'll be different.

1813
02:00:08,770 --> 02:00:14,310
I just thought it'd be different the second time I do it, guys.

1814
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:17,570
I was like, oh, It'll be different, I swear.

1815
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:19,670
But I can't even pass this.

1816
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:26,480
Toki, there is a jump button.

1817
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:30,820
Why would it be different?

1818
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:32,580
I don't know.

1819
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:33,840
I just thought...

1820
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:34,560
I don't know.

1821
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:37,320
In my head, I was like, oh, maybe this time.

1822
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:39,940
Maybe this time it'll work.

1823
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:41,880
Oh my god, there he is.

1824
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,220
Oh my god, finally a map.

1825
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:52,180
Oh, as much...

1826
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:57,260
As Yosemite Mohanus can be here, there's a whole new level of sweetness about these days.

1827
02:00:58,040 --> 02:00:59,800
Do you see the dark green for now?

1828
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:01,600
It's quite unsettling.

1829
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:04,980
To be near, I did my best to avoid it.

1830
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:08,300
Fortunately for me, I found another route in.

1831
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:12,420
Though I did end up a little since after weeding through some rashes.

1832
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:14,200
Which is a map?

1833
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:14,900
Yeah, I might as well.

1834
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:15,800
Give me that map.

1835
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:18,560
Oh, there he is.

1836
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:19,720
Okay, I just gotta go down.

1837
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:20,800
Oh, I see the alien.

1838
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,940
Wait, I don't have a bench.

1839
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:23,480
Oh, my God.

1840
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:24,540
When was the last bench?

1841
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,800
Okay, guys, maybe I can first try him.

1842
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:32,820
Maybe.

1843
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:35,260
Maybe there's hope.

1844
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:45,060
There is a bench there.

1845
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:47,780
Okay, you guys better not be lying.

1846
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:48,880
Surely.

1847
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:51,020
Surely there's a bench, right?

1848
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:55,380
Okay.

1849
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:55,640
Okay.

1850
02:01:56,020 --> 02:01:58,180
It's nice that they have these platforms when I can just...

1851
02:01:58,180 --> 02:02:00,000
Oh, I guess they can get one upgrade or the other.

1852
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:01,780
Depends on which upgrade you get.

1853
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:05,520
Ow.

1854
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,180
Ow!

1855
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:07,280
What the fuck?

1856
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,120
He, like, slapped me into the angelic fish.

1857
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:12,900
Okay.

1858
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:18,400
I guess I might be dying, but...

1859
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:21,280
But I'm gullible enough to believe in you.

1860
02:02:25,650 --> 02:02:26,050
Alright.

1861
02:02:26,770 --> 02:02:28,430
King's Pass, which is right before Dermot.

1862
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:30,550
I've heard you need to beat that before the first set.

1863
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:31,690
Can people confirm?

1864
02:02:32,230 --> 02:02:32,750
I'm just...

1865
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:32,970
Oh, shit!

1866
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:33,830
Oh, shit!

1867
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:35,990
I thought I was reading chat.

1868
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:38,370
I'm generally curious.

1869
02:02:38,830 --> 02:02:39,790
Thank you for the super chat.

1870
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:40,230
Thank you.

1871
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:41,110
Thank you.

1872
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:46,030
Okay, there he is.

1873
02:02:47,230 --> 02:02:48,170
Where's the bench?

1874
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:48,970
There's Quora.

1875
02:02:50,490 --> 02:02:53,110
Doesn't this kingdom just abound with surprises?

1876
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:55,810
A building atop an acid lake.

1877
02:02:56,770 --> 02:02:59,670
this site, I can't help but feel familiarity.

1878
02:03:00,690 --> 02:03:02,050
Something stirs in my mind.

1879
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:05,310
Although I can't tell yet, tell yet, tell what.

1880
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:10,210
I thought it meant less for discovery that led me here, but now there seems something else.

1881
02:03:10,770 --> 02:03:12,450
This building beckons me.

1882
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:13,870
Where's the bench?

1883
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:16,390
Oh wow, my chat died.

1884
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:18,590
I can't believe it.

1885
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:20,070
I have a shortcut!

1886
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:23,750
Oh, there's a bench inside.

1887
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:25,070
Oh, okay.

1888
02:03:26,770 --> 02:03:28,310
it's inside the hole.

1889
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:31,230
Alright, let's go inside.

1890
02:03:34,290 --> 02:03:35,570
Teachers Archives.

1891
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:37,530
Where have Bench yet?

1892
02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:43,610
Oh, there it is.

1893
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:45,490
Oh my god, Chad did it not!

1894
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:46,290
Let's go!

1895
02:03:48,190 --> 02:03:52,150
Okay, since I don't think I need the compass here, so I'll put that out.

1896
02:03:52,650 --> 02:03:53,730
I'll take this out.

1897
02:03:53,970 --> 02:03:55,830
And then let's see if I have anything I want to put.

1898
02:03:55,950 --> 02:03:56,590
That's two.

1899
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:57,850
Alright.

1900
02:03:58,210 --> 02:03:59,750
We'll be able to dash more often.

1901
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:29,780
not in the strike flow i'll do the strike flow from further away since i have two let's see i'm just gonna make sure all right compass is a must during this fight you gotta know where where you are on your on the map you don't understand in this boss but oh okay if i can do that then i'll grab the shaman stone Oh,

1902
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:30,100
wait, shit.

1903
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:30,560
I need that.

1904
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:31,480
Actually, I have.

1905
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:33,760
I'll grab the... Oh, I was gonna say the Soul Eater.

1906
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,220
Um, but it doesn't work like that.

1907
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:42,140
Um...

1908
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:43,980
Maybe...

1909
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:46,180
What can I... What should I put on?

1910
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:50,620
Quick Slash or Mark of Pride?

1911
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:53,920
I guess I'll do that.

1912
02:04:55,640 --> 02:04:57,100
I'll do... Oh, Quick Slash is better?

1913
02:04:58,140 --> 02:04:59,140
I feel that!

1914
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:00,380
Okay.

1915
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:03,120
Mmm...

1916
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:03,980
You want spells?

1917
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:05,900
Okay, then I'll just do...

1918
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:07,180
I'll do range then.

1919
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:09,740
I'm gonna do range.

1920
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:17,460
Oh man, I wonder where am I?

1921
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:24,100
It's like I haven't moved from this fucking map yet.

1922
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:28,900
God, if only I equipped the compass, guys.

1923
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:38,060
I assume it's this way.

1924
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:39,140
I assume it's just down.

1925
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:41,500
Like, you just go straight down.

1926
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:44,380
Which feels...

1927
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:45,200
Oh, there it is.

1928
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:47,840
Oh, it's just a giant jellyfish, isn't it?

1929
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:49,880
Oh, my God, it is.

1930
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,160
It's literally just a giant jellyfish.

1931
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,100
Oh, this...

1932
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:53,980
Oh, I...

1933
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:55,400
I hate it already.

1934
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:57,240
I hate it.

1935
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:59,040
Oh, I hate this bot.

1936
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:00,000
Oh, yeah, no.

1937
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:01,340
I can't stand still.

1938
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:03,120
Okay, now I know.

1939
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:06,060
But how do I kill him?

1940
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:09,300
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1941
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:12,220
Oh, hey, Quirl.

1942
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:13,660
Oh, Quirl's helping.

1943
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:14,760
Oh.

1944
02:06:16,420 --> 02:06:17,280
Oh, nice.

1945
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:19,440
Okay, I just got a...

1946
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:20,200
Okay, I get it.

1947
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:21,700
I literally just...

1948
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:23,120
What the fuck, Quirl?

1949
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,460
I thought you were helping me.

1950
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:29,020
Quirl, do your thing.

1951
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:32,760
Just slash him.

1952
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:39,140
I thought you were helping me.

1953
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:49,920
Oh my god, oh my god, okay.

1954
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:54,980
Jesus Christ, no, this guy.

1955
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:57,860
Oh, this guy is annoying, annoying.

1956
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,780
The fact that I can't charge anything here, too.

1957
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:11,310
Does he hurt me from...

1958
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:11,690
Okay, no.

1959
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:17,780
Yeah.

1960
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:20,580
Okay.

1961
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:23,540
Just focus on that running away.

1962
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:24,220
Running away!

1963
02:07:28,570 --> 02:07:30,610
We're bravely running away!

1964
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:32,450
We're bravely running away!

1965
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:36,870
Yeah, wait.

1966
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:40,650
I literally gotta wait till Quirl does his thing.

1967
02:07:41,490 --> 02:07:42,750
Gotta rely on...

1968
02:07:42,750 --> 02:07:43,830
It's like a group project.

1969
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:48,170
I gotta hope that my fucking buddy is doing his work in this group project.

1970
02:07:50,010 --> 02:07:51,410
Which is so risky.

1971
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:54,610
When your entire group project relies on one person.

1972
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:01,320
Okay.

1973
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:02,300
Just run.

1974
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:03,480
God damn it.

1975
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:05,640
A fucking range for that shit.

1976
02:08:08,420 --> 02:08:10,220
Yeah, I gotta wait for him to do his part.

1977
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:12,040
Okay.

1978
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:13,560
Absorb.

1979
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:18,000
Can I expect my boy Coral to help you about Orba farming?

1980
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:18,780
Doki.

1981
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:21,340
Thank you.

1982
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:21,880
Thank you.

1983
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:23,200
He's so cool.

1984
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:28,400
He spent 80% of that fucking fight going Hakim, Hakim.

1985
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:31,500
I just did nothing and then nothing.

1986
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:34,700
That's all he did.

1987
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:38,180
He said his like the catchphrase and then like did nothing.

1988
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:40,700
He's so cool.

1989
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:44,880
It's very... Which way do I go?

1990
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:45,740
Left or right?

1991
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:49,000
VD's or a farming dokey?

1992
02:08:54,100 --> 02:09:01,870
all right you couldn't do that without him does it matter all right i'll just go left then

1993
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:18,040
the fact that like this entire route project relies solely on him take full with charged lumiflimes okay

1994
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:27,160
oh wait what's this what the fuck i'm not reading that nerd shit.

1995
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:34,570
This.

1996
02:09:36,690 --> 02:09:37,630
Guess I go left?

1997
02:09:41,130 --> 02:09:42,810
There was so much stacks.

1998
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:46,550
I was like, this shit does not look like I didn't do anything.

1999
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:48,050
Something glows within this tank.

2000
02:09:49,890 --> 02:09:51,290
Something glows within that tank.

2001
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:52,070
Hello, Quiru.

2002
02:09:53,110 --> 02:09:54,690
She called to you, eh?

2003
02:09:55,270 --> 02:09:57,930
I realized it's no coincidence we arrived.

2004
02:09:57,950 --> 02:10:30,350
together though much of my memory is blank this plan I recall within these chambers to teach yourself to store the kingdom's knowledge and at its core she stored herself to save Holiness the teacher willingly became a seal but upon herself she enacted an additional protection though I cannot recall it happening I played a part in that fact she called me here now to reverse that protection all in need of you oh wait that's his mask Oh,

2005
02:10:30,570 --> 02:10:31,450
that's him!

2006
02:10:33,790 --> 02:10:34,210
Dream!

2007
02:10:35,110 --> 02:10:38,130
I think such a small creature will bear this kingdom's fate.

2008
02:10:39,130 --> 02:10:39,670
You're not Hesse.

2009
02:10:40,170 --> 02:10:42,830
The choice to reform was hers, not mine.

2010
02:10:43,230 --> 02:10:44,390
Oh my god, he gave it.

2011
02:10:44,450 --> 02:10:46,090
The mask was her all along.

2012
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:49,990
She knows what you would do and seem to welcome it.

2013
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:52,770
Oh, he's so naked now without the mask.

2014
02:10:52,890 --> 02:10:54,130
I like him with that mask.

2015
02:10:54,290 --> 02:10:54,810
This is weird.

2016
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:57,170
Do I dream her?

2017
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:58,570
Dream!

2018
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:01,710
Yeah, sexy lava lap.

2019
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:07,370
I assume she was a teacher.

2020
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:17,540
For diversity, a seal.

2021
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,420
A world forever unchanging.

2022
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:25,800
The seals must break.

2023
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:30,420
Forever.

2024
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:31,960
All right, goodbye.

2025
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:37,000
Welcome to London.

2026
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:44,880
It's a London handshake.

2027
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:47,440
Need a focus.

2028
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:49,500
Don't worry.

2029
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,410
I'm pumping a lot of stairwells into me right now.

2030
02:11:57,610 --> 02:11:58,050
Yay!

2031
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:11,640
I'm just giving her a welcome back.

2032
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:12,860
Bye!

2033
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:52,390

2034
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:56,650
Alright.

2035
02:12:57,830 --> 02:12:59,170
Go to Blue Lake, smile.

2036
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:10,770
There's people that want the other dragoons to suffer, and then there's people who, like, want you guys to not suffer.

2037
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:17,170
I don't even know where the fuck Blue Lake is.

2038
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:21,030
I don't even know where that is, guys.

2039
02:13:23,530 --> 02:13:25,190
No, there's nothing at the bottom, right?

2040
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:27,150
Is it a lake that's blue?

2041
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:34,240
I want war.

2042
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:40,110
Pull up my map.

2043
02:13:40,490 --> 02:13:41,890
Hmm, I wonder where I am.

2044
02:13:46,990 --> 02:13:47,510
Man.

2045
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:55,690
Yeah, I don't think I risked that.

2046
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:57,770
I was like, I don't think that was gonna hit me.

2047
02:14:00,510 --> 02:14:02,570
I shouldn't even remember how to get back up.

2048
02:14:03,890 --> 02:14:05,590
It's like up top somewhere.

2049
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:11,060
It's like here?

2050
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:11,820
I assume.

2051
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:13,880
I knew I like went up.

2052
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:14,840
Yeah, there you go.

2053
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:19,980
If only I had a compass to tell me where I am.

2054
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:23,000
Oh wait, I have to go back to this bend.

2055
02:14:30,970 --> 02:14:33,090
Alright, now I get rid of...

2056
02:14:33,850 --> 02:14:34,850
Mark of Pride.

2057
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:36,490
Get my compass back.

2058
02:14:37,090 --> 02:14:41,150
my gathering swarm and what is it thor in here

2059
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:47,390

2060
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:59,480

2061
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:07,600
first off i gotta figure out how to get there we're actually doing blue lake

2062
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:21,080
And that chat is filled with apostas and everyone is fighting.

2063
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:26,940
Please release us from this suffering ever since I put on the suit.

2064
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:32,160
The chat has been in shambles.

2065
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:34,120
Thank you for the super chat, Gabriel.

2066
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:34,900
Thank you.

2067
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:35,840
Thank you.

2068
02:15:39,130 --> 02:15:39,790
Whoa, wait.

2069
02:15:39,930 --> 02:15:40,770
Someone's sleeping.

2070
02:15:41,830 --> 02:15:42,570
Who's sleeping?

2071
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:55,130

02:16:03,370 --> 02:16:04,290
I could feel it.

2074

02:16:17,670 --> 02:16:18,670
Welcome to tomato farm.

2077
02:16:18,930 --> 02:16:19,570
Welcome, welcome.

2078
02:16:21,290 --> 02:16:22,330
Mentally prepared myself.

2079
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:22,750
Why?

2080
02:16:23,710 --> 02:16:25,210
Someone just, is someone gonna die?

2081
02:16:26,290 --> 02:16:28,770
People only say that if someone's gonna die.

2082
02:16:29,710 --> 02:16:30,550
Lucky for you.

2083
02:16:31,070 --> 02:16:31,750
Not all bug.

2084
02:16:31,850 --> 02:16:32,910
Oh my god!

2085
02:16:33,470 --> 02:16:34,250
What the fuck?

2086
02:16:36,410 --> 02:16:37,550
Lucky for you.

2087
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:41,890
Not all bug lives matters, especially hornets.

2088
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:44,770
I feel like it won't affect me that badly.

2089
02:16:52,830 --> 02:17:05,610
PSN Welcome to Tamia Farm Welcome, welcome I want to see blood Fight, fight, fight How could you?

Alright, here I am.

2094
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:02,840
It looks like Blue Lake has one.

2095
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:09,100
You saw Ramblin' exploding while we gaslight you through the wrong speedrunner strats.

2096
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:10,060
Thanks, Wings!

2097
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:11,440
Thank you for the super chat.

2098
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:12,620
Thank you, thank you.

2099
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:20,840
Alright, if you go to the deep nest to get the other alien mass upgrade, then that unlocks the final boss.

2100
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:22,880
lore and an upgrade.

2101
02:18:22,980 --> 02:18:34,260
Okay, we'll grab the last alien mask, and so that will unlock the final boss, and then because we unlocked it, we will do, um, the ancient Basin for the lore and upgrade then.

2102
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:35,180
Alright.

2103
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:36,200
Oh, there's Blue Lake.

2104
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:36,900
I see it.

2105
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:38,340
Alright, time to go to Blue Lake.

2106
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:40,160
Wait.

2107
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:41,860
Yeah.

2108
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:42,940
Alright, we're here.

2109
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:44,920
Alright, guys.

2110
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:49,760
It's time to see why you guys fought about this one particular area.

2111
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:51,700
I'm very curious.

2112
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:53,960
It made chat very divided.

2113
02:18:54,740 --> 02:18:55,760
All right, here you go.

2114
02:18:58,280 --> 02:18:59,300
What's in this lake?

2115
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:00,620
Oh, hey.

2116
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:01,480
It's him.

2117
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:03,740
Oh, is he gonna drown himself?

2118
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:05,900
Because he's maskless now?

2119
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:08,480
He's showing the world his mask.

2120
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:14,560
Again we meet, my short friend.

2121
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:18,300
Here, at last, I feel at peace.

2122
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:21,280
Twice I've seen this world.

2123
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:29,600
Though my services may have stripped the first experience for me, I'm thankful I could witness this beauty again.

2124
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:40,020
Holiness is a vast and wondrous thing, but with as many wonders as its holds, I've seen none quite so intriguing as you.

2125
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:46,640
Ah, my flattery turns only silent stoxism.

2126
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:48,360
I like that.

2127
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:50,320
Beep, boop, boop, beep.

2128
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:52,660
I like that very much.

2129
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:55,500
Alright, crewmates can only talk in beeps.

2130
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:01,980
Spend a final moment with Krull.

2131
02:20:02,320 --> 02:20:05,780
If I just leave and don't sit with him, does he just stay there?

2132
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:12,900
Oh, dream now.

2133
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:14,280
Dream!

2134
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:19,040
To live an age yet remember so little.

2135
02:20:19,720 --> 02:20:21,000
Perhaps I should be thankful.

2136
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:23,080
All tragedy erased.

2137
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:25,100
I see only wonders.

2138
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:28,120
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream.

2139
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:28,700
Dream, dream.

2140
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:31,300
All right, let's sit with him before he, I guess, dies.

2141
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:32,160
Oh, shit.

2142
02:20:33,240 --> 02:20:34,240
Who's this guy?

2143
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:36,620
All right.

2144
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,800
We're going to watch this live.

2145
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:41,580
Is he not going to get up?

2146
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:43,460
Oh, okay.

2147
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:44,880
I just put on my suit.

2148
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:46,700
I take it off.

2149
02:20:47,180 --> 02:20:47,680
Put it on.

2150
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:48,320
All right, come on, guys.

2151
02:20:48,380 --> 02:20:48,640
Come on.

2152
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:49,940
Come on.

2153
02:20:50,180 --> 02:20:50,580
Let's go.

2154
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:51,720
Come on.

2155
02:20:52,860 --> 02:20:53,900
Swim with me.

2156
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:56,040
We can go down together.

2157
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:56,660
Girl.

2158
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:00,540
I'll leave and come back the room.

2159
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:06,240
Alright, Quirrel, let's go!

2160
02:21:06,460 --> 02:21:06,940
Come on!

2161
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:09,280
Watch up close!

2162
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:11,660
You monster!

2163
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:13,020
What am I doing?

2164
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,480
I'm just going on a swim with my bro, Quirrel!

2165
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:20,220
Tokey, please!

2166
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:23,100
The water is so nice!

2167
02:21:24,380 --> 02:21:25,840
Alright, is he...

2168
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:26,060
Oh.

2169
02:21:29,250 --> 02:21:29,850
Oh.

2170
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:31,450
He's got...

2171
02:21:31,450 --> 02:21:33,710
I find his body floating in the water?

2172
02:21:36,810 --> 02:21:38,010
He's a...

2173
02:21:38,010 --> 02:21:40,710
Maybe he's still there in the water.

2174
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:43,150
Goodbye, Quirrel.

2175
02:21:45,050 --> 02:21:46,530
Oh no, he's gone, gone.

2176
02:21:48,830 --> 02:21:49,490
Oh my god.

2177
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:50,670
Goodbye, Quirrel.

2178
02:21:51,130 --> 02:21:52,190
We'll miss you.

2179
02:21:53,070 --> 02:21:53,650
Adios.

2180
02:21:54,110 --> 02:21:56,310
Maybe he's just on vacation, guys.

2181
02:21:56,430 --> 02:21:57,670
You don't know that.

2182
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:58,850
There's no body.

2183
02:22:00,430 --> 02:22:18,590

2185
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:39,190
He might as well be dead.

2186
02:22:39,930 --> 02:22:42,930
I remember how I get to ancient Bees and whatever it's called.

2187
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:46,250
Put on your water wings, bro.

2188
02:22:46,830 --> 02:22:49,150
Everyone is crying and joking.

2189
02:22:50,890 --> 02:22:52,710

2193
02:22:57,610 --> 02:23:00,070
You guys are so pessimistic.

2194
02:23:00,230 --> 02:23:02,310
You don't know if he's actually dead.

2195

Thank you.

2200
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:41,640
Also, I read it earlier.

2201
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:53,200
Someone said that that I should do the basin first so that I can so I can complete the Jane Silkson story.

2202
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:54,780
So I'll do that.

2203
02:23:57,860 --> 02:23:58,580
Wait, was there?

2204
02:23:58,620 --> 02:23:59,420
Oh, there is a bench.

2205
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:00,300
I just missed it.

2206
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:00,940
Whoops.

2207
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:06,200
Where's my bench?

2208
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:07,760
Oh, it's on the other side.

2209
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:08,760
Jesus Christ.

2210
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:10,700
It's not uniformed.

2211
02:24:15,290 --> 02:24:17,090
Okay, bugs normally don't live that long anyway.

2212
02:24:17,550 --> 02:24:20,290
He lived a very fulfilling life.

2213
02:24:21,250 --> 02:24:22,830
He lived way longer than he should.

2214
02:24:23,810 --> 02:24:24,450
There's a bug.

2215
02:24:24,510 --> 02:24:25,550
There's a fly out there.

2216
02:24:25,650 --> 02:24:37,390
There's lots of bug species out there who are born and they literally have like, what is it, five hours to live before they die.

2217
02:24:39,850 --> 02:25:39,390
so that crow lived a good life they are born they fuck give birth and then they die so that crow lived a good life oh they don't get knocked back okay I think it's less than that it's like three hours I don't remember I know there's some bugs out there that that's entire existence is literally just hatch out of an egg grow for an hour buck lay eggs then die before they can even see their kids hatch our pure vessel has ascended beyond lies only the refute and regret of its creation we shall enter that place no longer all right is it not here oh it's here knock knock that sounds like a live oh okay let me in I assume I just had to go down.

2219
02:25:47,810 --> 02:25:48,710
This way?

2220
02:25:49,710 --> 02:25:50,910
Don't wait for him to...

2221
02:25:54,190 --> 02:25:54,710
Ooh.

2222
02:25:55,890 --> 02:25:57,150
I'll be careful here.

2223
02:25:58,110 --> 02:26:00,170
I want to fall into the depths.

2224
02:26:02,810 --> 02:26:04,110
I don't know where to go.

2225
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:07,690
Do I really just go down?

2226
02:26:08,510 --> 02:26:09,890

2227
02:26:09,910 --> 02:26:12,970

Oh, shit.

2234
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:31,640
There's lots of ghosts here.

2235
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:33,580
Right?

2236
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:37,460
Left is an upgrade you don't have.

2237
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:38,700
Oh, should I go left then?

2238
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:39,220
Oh.

2239
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:43,160
Okay, left is an upgrade.

2240
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:49,060
Yeah, these look like my brothers.

2241
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:50,340
My god.

2242
02:27:50,460 --> 02:27:51,780
Whoever my mom is.

2243
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:52,840
And my dad.

2244
02:27:54,220 --> 02:27:55,780
They'd be having a good time.

2245
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:57,960
Oh, both are upgrades?

2246
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:58,320
Okay.

2247
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:02,720
I don't have the base thing to upgrade the left.

2248
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:06,700
Oh, I need an upgrade that I don't have.

2249
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:07,820
Oh, okay.

2250
02:28:11,630 --> 02:28:13,850
It's basically like...

2251
02:28:14,990 --> 02:28:15,550
Um...

2252
02:28:15,550 --> 02:28:20,230
It's like basically they're like, you are not successful, so we're just gonna make another one.

2253
02:28:21,450 --> 02:28:22,510
Another child.

2254
02:28:23,010 --> 02:28:23,530
What the?

2255
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:24,190
What?

2256
02:28:25,090 --> 02:28:26,230
What the fuck is that?

2257
02:28:28,270 --> 02:28:30,150
Ooh, I don't like that.

2258
02:28:31,730 --> 02:28:33,710
Looks like they're trying to grab for my soul.

2259
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:40,700
Here we go this way.

2260
02:28:41,940 --> 02:28:42,500
Yay!

2261
02:28:43,320 --> 02:28:43,700
Hello.

2262
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:46,540
Hello, brother.

2263
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:48,800
Not my fault you were a failure.

2264
02:28:49,700 --> 02:28:51,120
And that mom liked me more.

2265
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:55,140
Maybe if you didn't fail, you wouldn't be dead.

2266
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:58,080
Ow, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I did not mean that.

2267
02:28:59,860 --> 02:29:00,920
I was just joking.

2268
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:03,220
Just some sibling joking going on.

2269
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:08,840
You know, just a casual sibling sibling banter.

2270
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:13,900
Say that again, Toki.

2271
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:15,460
Alright,

2272
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:20,300
nice.

2273
02:29:20,780 --> 02:29:21,280
Out of them.

2274
02:29:21,820 --> 02:29:23,000
Wait, they don't even give souls.

2275
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:25,300
I'm literally killing a soul.

2276
02:29:25,860 --> 02:29:33,760
How do they not give souls if I'm killing a soul okay

2277
02:29:37,720 --> 02:30:03,540
oh there's more coming to me I actually needed that oh they don't have souls they're voids oh that's why they're like pitch black hello why am I still at the teacher's archive.

2278
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:07,160
Wait, what happens now?

2279
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:17,580
Oh, there is a dead guy.

2280
02:30:18,900 --> 02:30:19,420
Can it help?

2281
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:19,940
Cannot.

2282
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:21,280
My king, I'm sorry.

2283
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:22,460
The sea calls.

2284
02:30:28,660 --> 02:30:29,500
What do I do?

2285
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:30,480
What do I do from here?

2286
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:36,960
Go down and to the right.

2287
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:41,920
Oh, okay, I see it.

2288
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:43,940
I see the light.

2289
02:30:45,340 --> 02:31:14,840

2291
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:27,620
I shall drink the dark liquid without questions asked.

2292
02:31:29,740 --> 02:31:30,860
Oh, shit.

2293
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:33,060
Shade cloak.

2294
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:35,440
Press RT to dash forward.

2295
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:38,080
Use an attack without...

2296
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:38,500
Oh!

2297
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:40,300
It's like a roll.

2298
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:43,680
Dash through enemies and attacks without taking damage.

2299
02:31:43,860 --> 02:31:44,400
Oh, okay.

2300
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:46,280
It's like a...

2301
02:31:46,280 --> 02:31:47,240
I-frames, right?

2302
02:31:48,260 --> 02:31:50,220
I can I-frame it.

2303
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:55,080
Oh my god, I can dash through everything now.

2304
02:31:55,580 --> 02:31:55,600
Oh!

2305
02:31:59,320 --> 02:32:00,500
Oh, and I get charmed.

2306
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:00,960
Nice.

2307
02:32:04,360 --> 02:32:06,160
Yeah, I cannot dash through everything.

2308
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:07,380
That's pretty good.

2309
02:32:15,970 --> 02:32:17,730
Alright, now we go home.

2310
02:32:18,290 --> 02:32:19,310
Oh wait, I can just...

2311
02:32:19,310 --> 02:32:20,150
I can just UFO.

2312
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:23,630
You seem we have a problem.

2313
02:32:27,890 --> 02:32:28,810
Alright, nice.

2314
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:31,030
It's a little cool down.

2315
02:32:31,130 --> 02:32:31,750
Oh, it does.

2316
02:32:31,870 --> 02:32:32,370
I see it.

2317
02:32:34,830 --> 02:32:35,270
Alright.

2318
02:32:36,230 --> 02:32:39,990
Now that we do that, can I do the third alien now?

2319
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:51,780
This is in Queen's Garden?

2320
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:53,920
Okay, now I can do the third alien.

2321
02:32:54,760 --> 02:32:55,080
Nice.

2322
02:32:55,240 --> 02:32:57,340
Oh my god, how do I get back up?

2323
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:01,660
Oh, this is what the platform is for.

2324
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:07,760
Now I know why they gave me so many platforms.

2325
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:12,200
Oh, fuck yeah, I don't care that much.

2326
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:13,540
Not slowly.

2327
02:33:21,390 --> 02:33:22,610
Wait, how the fuck...

2328
02:33:22,610 --> 02:33:23,450
Oh, I was gonna say it.

2329
02:33:23,470 --> 02:33:24,350
Where do I go now?

2330
02:33:26,950 --> 02:33:27,770
This way.

2331
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:33,700
Oh, shit.

2332
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:35,380
Are you serious?

2333
02:33:35,580 --> 02:33:37,360
The platform was below me!

2334
02:33:44,060 --> 02:33:44,560
Okay.

2335
02:33:47,930 --> 02:33:49,250
I'll just go this way.

2336
02:33:49,550 --> 02:33:50,210
Fuck this.

2337
02:33:51,010 --> 02:33:51,430
No!

2338
02:33:52,290 --> 02:33:53,790
Oh my god, please, please.

2339
02:33:54,110 --> 02:33:55,390
Oh my god, thank god, thank god.

2340
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:57,110
Okay, I don't have to...

2341
02:33:57,110 --> 02:33:57,990
I don't have to do the...

2342
02:33:58,810 --> 02:33:59,990
The full clan.

2343
02:34:01,090 --> 02:34:01,750
Thank god.

2344
02:34:02,470 --> 02:34:06,710
Oh, thank god, okay.

2345
02:34:08,870 --> 02:34:11,250
Oh my god, I hate this.

2346
02:34:13,390 --> 02:34:14,930
Actually, I do go from here.

2347
02:34:19,410 --> 02:34:19,850
Okay.

2348
02:34:21,430 --> 02:34:23,270
This should be...

2349
02:34:24,170 --> 02:34:32,090
I can't do the left side yet apparently because I don't have the uh I don't have the spell for it

2350
02:34:39,540 --> 02:35:00,680
oh hey wait where did you come from did I go too far wait just in case just hello I see you face the place of your birth and now drape yourself in the substance of the shadow is born of similar size.

2351
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:05,620
That part of you, that crucial emptiness, I do not share.

2352
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:06,640
Hey, big sister!

2353
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:10,420
Funny then that such darkness gives me hope.

2354
02:35:11,020 --> 02:35:13,140
Within it, I see the chance to change.

2355
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:17,600
A difficult journey, you would face, but a choice it can create.

2356
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:21,140
Prolong our world's stasis or face the heart of its infection.

2357
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:27,140
I urge you to take the harder path, but what end may come, the decision rests with you.

2358
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:28,160
Dream!

2359
02:35:29,020 --> 02:35:31,820
It faced the void and said, Escape.

2360
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:33,920
Can you ignite such vast darkness?

2361
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:35,300
Where am I?

2362
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:36,180
Oh, that's...

2363
02:35:36,180 --> 02:35:37,820
Oh, she was meeting me here.

2364
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:39,700
Yeah, I met myself.

2365
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:41,440
All right, now back to Among Us.

2366
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:43,020
All right.

2367
02:35:44,580 --> 02:35:47,880
I gotta go this way.

2368
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:55,040
Okay.

2369
02:35:55,640 --> 02:35:58,520
Then we fly this way to the bench.

2370
02:36:01,460 --> 02:36:02,840
I had to be sure.

2371
02:36:03,460 --> 02:36:23,360
to be sure that like like she was telling me something important okay the abyss okay now we gotta go to we gotta go to the stack station and then go to queen station okay we gotta go this way

2372
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:52,770
oh wait don't worry the filler episode will end very soon don't we're all done with the filler guys we're almost done with the filler part okay queen station

2373
02:36:59,510 --> 02:37:38,380

2374
02:37:45,420 --> 02:38:16,560

2375
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:26,080
It is this way.

2376
02:38:30,820 --> 02:38:32,380
That place.

2377
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:38,760
Okay, and then go this way.

2378
02:38:41,080 --> 02:38:43,420
Surely it can't be that bad, guys.

2379
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:43,820
Haha!

2380
02:38:46,980 --> 02:38:49,160
And then this way.

2381
02:38:56,040 --> 02:38:58,180
And down I'll go into the hole.

2382
02:39:01,650 --> 02:39:04,510
And down I'll go to another hole.

2383
02:39:05,970 --> 02:39:07,230
A lot of backtracking.

2384
02:39:10,630 --> 02:39:13,230
The fact that they won't die for me is really fucked up.

2385
02:39:13,790 --> 02:39:15,950
What kind of cult do you have, Mantis Village?

2386
02:39:19,530 --> 02:39:20,050
Alright.

2387
02:39:21,730 --> 02:39:23,250
I'm at the deep nest now.

2388
02:39:25,190 --> 02:39:28,350
I got the map, though, for the deep nest for some fucking reason.

2389
02:39:34,450 --> 02:39:36,610
I'm like wondering, how do we get to that part?

2390
02:39:39,790 --> 02:39:41,470
Are you thinking here that I can?

2391
02:39:46,730 --> 02:39:48,390
Alright, this way.

2392
02:39:50,370 --> 02:39:52,330
Yay, I can watch them.

2393
02:39:53,430 --> 02:39:55,610
Just want to make sure there's no secret tunnel.

2394
02:39:56,270 --> 02:39:57,230
Secret tunnel.

2395
02:39:59,010 --> 02:40:02,810
I swear, everyone forgets Queen's Garden connects to Deep Nest 2.

2396
02:40:03,150 --> 02:40:04,230
Name is Super Chat Nicholas.

2397
02:40:04,430 --> 02:40:05,270
Thank you, thank you.

2398
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:06,470
Oh my god, I remember.

2399
02:40:08,210 --> 02:40:08,710
I...

2400
02:40:08,710 --> 02:40:11,290
I hear the tumbling.

2401
02:40:12,170 --> 02:40:13,750
The sound of the tumbles.

2402
02:40:14,290 --> 02:40:14,970
I remember.

2403
02:40:16,950 --> 02:40:18,110
What is this?

2404
02:40:18,230 --> 02:40:19,070
Oh, shit!

2405
02:40:27,970 --> 02:40:29,950
Okay, this went nowhere!

2406
02:40:30,270 --> 02:40:30,850
Oh, wait, no.

2407
02:40:31,950 --> 02:40:33,410
Okay, that was actual bait.

2408
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:34,730
I thought there would be...

2409
02:40:34,730 --> 02:40:35,490
Okay, oh, it's just...

2410
02:40:35,490 --> 02:40:36,630
I mean, it's money, I guess.

2411
02:40:40,130 --> 02:40:41,290
Alright, it's money.

2412
02:40:41,310 --> 02:40:43,310
I mean, I'll take it.

2413
02:40:45,730 --> 02:40:46,210
Oh my god.

2414
02:40:47,330 --> 02:40:49,050
I don't like this area already.

2415
02:40:50,470 --> 02:40:52,590
This area does not bring me joy.

2416
02:40:54,290 --> 02:40:56,650
I don't think it ever gave anybody joy.

2417
02:41:03,080 --> 02:41:03,140
Okay.

2418
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:06,020
What's on the left side?

2419
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:11,720
Wait, what the fuck?

2420
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:12,380
Oh, okay.

2421
02:41:13,220 --> 02:41:14,540
I couldn't tell what that does.

2422
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:15,960
Oh, what the fuck?

2423
02:41:16,220 --> 02:41:17,620
Oh, it's a Trap!

2424
02:41:19,180 --> 02:41:21,340
Oh, what am I looking at?

2425
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:23,980
What the fuck am I looking at?

2426
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:29,800
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

2427
02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:31,780
Okay, that's just money.

2428
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:32,920
We don't need money.

2429
02:41:38,350 --> 02:41:39,650
Okay, we can go up.

2430
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:44,840
Assume we can go...

2431
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:46,260
Oh my god, we can go up.

2432
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:47,620
I just heal real quick.

2433
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:57,080

2434
02:42:00,260 --> 02:42:03,640

2436
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:24,200
from me.

2437
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:26,260
Where do I go?

2438
02:42:31,020 --> 02:42:32,240
Down or up?

2439
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:34,820
I'll go down for now.

2440
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:43,000
Yeah, I'll keep going down.

2441
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:45,740
Oh!

2442
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:52,240
I- I- Okay, that was scary.

2443
02:42:52,780 --> 02:42:53,740
But like, we're okay.

2444
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:54,360
Oh!

2445
02:42:57,080 --> 02:42:57,380
Wait.

2446
02:42:59,340 --> 02:43:00,560
Can we not go that way?

2447
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:02,560
Where do I go?

2448
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:06,140
Oh my god.

2449
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:09,200
Oh, and I can't kill him.

2450
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:13,140
He's just so beefy.

2451
02:43:17,060 --> 02:43:17,500
Alright.

2452
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:19,580
Is anything up here?

2453
02:43:21,220 --> 02:43:21,760
No?

2454
02:43:23,220 --> 02:43:23,780
Oh.

2455
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:25,120
Still nothing?

2456
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:28,300
Oh, this is a maze.

2457
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:29,940
This maze fucking sucks.

2458
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:35,380
Welcome to the deep nests, baby.

2459
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:38,220
Where am I?

2460
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:40,900
Oh, that's...

2461
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:44,580
Okay, now I'm here.

2462
02:43:45,880 --> 02:43:47,100
Wait, there's bats there.

2463
02:43:49,560 --> 02:43:50,820
Okay, I figured it out.

2464
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:51,820
Oh, my God.

2465
02:43:51,940 --> 02:43:54,060
I don't know how, but I figured it out.

2466
02:43:57,360 --> 02:43:58,880
Alright, let's look at this map.

2467
02:43:59,340 --> 02:44:00,100
Oh, okay.

2468
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:01,820
We did it.

2469
02:44:02,360 --> 02:44:05,140
Why is there so many pitfalls?

2470
02:44:05,900 --> 02:44:07,300
We fucking did it.

2471
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:10,220
I don't know how, but we figured it out.

2472
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:13,300
That's America.

2473
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:19,280
Wait, now where is this area taking me?

2474
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:22,800
Oh my god, where am I going now?

2475
02:44:28,400 --> 02:44:30,060
It's just a break.

2476
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:31,440
Or go, wait.

2477
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:32,960
Where does left go?

2478
02:44:33,140 --> 02:44:35,080
The mask is all the way to the left.

2479
02:44:38,160 --> 02:44:43,180
Oh Right, it's just a charm Is the charm not good?

2480
02:44:45,020 --> 02:44:46,240
Do we not want the charm?

2481
02:44:51,750 --> 02:44:52,150
Oh shit!

2482
02:44:52,470 --> 02:44:52,670
Oh shit!

2483
02:44:53,570 --> 02:44:54,710
Oh shit!

2484
02:44:55,370 --> 02:44:55,650
Whoops.

2485
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:02,730
No, it's a pain in the ass to get.

2486
02:45:03,590 --> 02:45:04,570
I just got money.

2487
02:45:07,210 --> 02:45:08,410
Wait, where do I go here?

2488
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:15,700
Okay, clearly it's not there.

2489
02:45:16,860 --> 02:45:17,900
Where the fuck do I go?

2490
02:45:20,780 --> 02:45:21,880
Oh, here.

2491
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:25,540
And then up?

2492
02:45:30,880 --> 02:45:31,760
Where am I?

2493
02:45:32,500 --> 02:45:34,700
Where the fuck this map isn't helping me?

2494
02:45:35,420 --> 02:45:36,400
Oh, my God.

2495
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:44,040
Oh, no, not the spikes.

2496
02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:46,600
Oh.

2497
02:45:48,520 --> 02:46:19,600

2500
02:46:56,470 --> 02:46:57,910
It's so fucked up.

2501
02:46:58,270 --> 02:47:00,150
Like where the area I lost it in.

2502
02:47:00,990 --> 02:47:02,330
It's pretty fucked up.

2503
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:15,580
I guess it's so frustrating.

2504
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:20,360
Yeah.

2505
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:26,360
Maybe my soul would come visit me.

2506
02:47:33,420 --> 02:47:34,040

Hucking a demon K-pop on there right there.

2515
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:16,420
Do not have the range to sing that.

2516
02:49:16,820 --> 02:49:17,900
We actually did it.

2517
02:49:18,140 --> 02:49:19,780
And all I got was a fucking mask.

2518
02:49:20,600 --> 02:49:23,000
The deadliest elevator of all time.

2519
02:49:24,740 --> 02:49:26,820
All I got was a dumb mask.

2520
02:49:29,900 --> 02:49:30,080
Alright.

2521
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:35,140
And then, so how do we get the charge?

2522
02:49:36,360 --> 02:49:37,940
Where is the charm?

2523
02:49:39,700 --> 02:49:41,120
It's down, like here?

2524
02:49:41,240 --> 02:49:42,560
Oh, it's down there.

2525
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:46,420
Here.

2526
02:49:47,140 --> 02:49:47,740
Wait, no.

2527
02:49:48,560 --> 02:49:49,500
This is where I started.

2528
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:53,440
How the fuck did I get there?

2529
02:49:55,780 --> 02:49:56,440
Bottom, right?

2530
02:49:56,480 --> 02:49:57,160
Oh, here.

2531
02:49:57,940 --> 02:49:58,320
Oh, my God.

2532
02:49:58,380 --> 02:49:59,080
There was a hole there.

2533
02:49:59,180 --> 02:50:00,040
I didn't even see the hole.

2534
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:04,240
Which hole do I go?

Oh, never mind.

2542
02:51:13,900 --> 02:51:14,960
No dreaming for you.

2543
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:16,500
I guess.

2544
02:51:16,920 --> 02:51:20,060
No, you don't got the dream because you have no soul, I guess.

2545
02:51:20,140 --> 02:51:21,180
You didn't go to heaven.

2546
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:23,360
So you don't get the dream.

2547
02:51:24,220 --> 02:51:24,860
I'm dead.

2548
02:51:29,080 --> 02:51:31,620
What were your thoughts when he did that?

2549
02:51:31,820 --> 02:51:33,120
I don't know.

2550
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:34,840
I just, I dashed.

2551
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:38,700
I thought that was a good dash.

2552
02:51:41,440 --> 02:51:44,480
At least I can get healed.

2553
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:50,220
Alright, I triple heal.

2554
02:51:51,080 --> 02:51:52,780
That means I can triple live now.

2555
02:51:53,120 --> 02:52:03,640
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

2556
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:04,020
Alright.

2557
02:52:04,380 --> 02:52:07,240
We need 5 more to unlock another charm slot.

2558
02:52:08,700 --> 02:52:10,060
Oh, Spring gives full juice?

2559
02:52:10,220 --> 02:52:12,000
Oh yeah, I should give full juice.

2560
02:52:13,320 --> 02:52:16,100
Oh, I thought you meant, like, Solus, but just the HP.

2561
02:52:19,320 --> 02:52:20,860
These guys are little babies.

2562
02:52:21,140 --> 02:52:22,280
I can kill them.

2563
02:52:27,410 --> 02:52:29,430
Alright, I don't want to worry too much about these guys.

2564
02:52:30,110 --> 02:52:30,790
Pretty weak.

2565
02:52:34,090 --> 02:52:34,810
Oh, it does.

2566
02:52:34,930 --> 02:52:36,410
Alright, it doesn't really matter.

2567
02:52:37,610 --> 02:52:38,930
I'm very strong as fuck.

2568
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:43,640
What?

2569
02:52:45,180 --> 02:52:46,220
What's that sound?

2570
02:52:48,240 --> 02:52:49,080
It's like, oh.

2571
02:52:50,780 --> 02:52:52,620
Wait, something's chasing me.

2572
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:56,400
Something's trying to fucking chase me right now.

2573
02:53:00,270 --> 02:53:02,610
It was like scurrying and everything.

2574
02:53:05,070 --> 02:53:05,790
Oh, that's fine.

2575
02:53:07,550 --> 02:53:08,750
I can heal from this.

2576
02:53:09,850 --> 02:53:13,030
Yeah, I heard you was like, who's chasing me?

2577
02:53:15,110 --> 02:53:16,930
Oh, hey, he got captured again.

2578
02:53:17,730 --> 02:53:19,350
I thought he was a great mighty.

2579
02:53:20,130 --> 02:53:21,030
Whatever his name was.

2580
02:53:21,190 --> 02:53:21,950
I already forgot his name.

2581
02:53:24,190 --> 02:53:25,350
How do I save him?

2582
02:53:27,070 --> 02:53:27,850
Oh, my God.

2583
02:53:28,010 --> 02:53:29,250
That poor guy's washed.

2584
02:53:30,410 --> 02:53:33,210
Hate to break it to you, but you might be washed, old man.

2585
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:38,540
Don't save him.

2586
02:53:38,940 --> 02:53:39,600
Wait, what?

2587
02:53:43,460 --> 02:53:44,560
What did he do?

2588
02:53:48,460 --> 02:53:50,120
don't save him

2589
02:53:53,960 --> 02:53:58,040

02:54:01,230 --> 02:54:03,870

Now all bugs don't matter!

2596
02:54:33,880 --> 02:54:34,400

Is there...

02:54:44,380 --> 02:54:46,000
How do I get there?

2602
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:48,240
I don't even think I can save him.

2603
02:54:48,280 --> 02:54:49,620
I don't even know how to get there.

2604
02:54:55,790 --> 02:55:00,490
Yeah, nothing... none of the rocks break.

2605
02:55:02,790 --> 02:55:03,970

He's beyond saving.

2610
02:55:23,230 --> 02:55:24,090
Another room?

2611
02:55:24,270 --> 02:55:25,190

2615
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:04,140
Whatever.

2616
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:05,380
I don't have space anyway.

2617
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:08,060

Is there anything else here that I have to go?

2624
02:56:24,660 --> 02:56:25,180

All right.

2629
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:36,960
Oh my god, it spit out a child.

2630
02:56:38,340 --> 02:56:39,460
All right, that's gross.

2631

Bro, that's disgusting.

Go to the hospital for that.

2633
02:56:42,780 --> 02:56:45,420
I did not consent to see you do that.

2634
02:56:48,820 --> 02:56:51,140
I did not consent to see you give birth.

2635
02:56:59,380 --> 02:56:59,700
All right.

2636
02:57:00,060 --> 02:57:01,200

2638
02:57:04,060 --> 02:57:05,160
Butterfly is HP.

2639
02:57:07,440 --> 02:57:07,800
Yay.

2640
02:57:10,860 --> 02:57:11,700
What's here?

2641
02:57:12,600 --> 02:57:13,600
Oh, is this the tram?

2642
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:17,040
Oh, it's the old tram system.

2643
02:57:20,620 --> 02:57:21,460
Okay, here I go.

2644
02:57:27,140 --> 02:57:28,960
Stop getting pregnant.

2645
02:57:31,680 --> 02:57:32,680
Open that.

2646
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:37,160
Look at this open.

2647
02:57:37,260 --> 02:57:38,280
Oh, it gave me a shortcut.

2648
02:57:38,580 --> 02:57:38,780
Okay.

2649
02:57:41,440 --> 02:57:42,860
I'm not here to see.

2650
02:57:43,020 --> 02:57:45,000
The miracle of childbirth is very disgusting.

2651
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:55,900
Yeah.

2652
02:57:57,660 --> 02:57:58,720
Oh my god, there's more.

2653
02:57:59,620 --> 02:58:00,600
Oh my god.

2654
02:58:01,620 --> 02:58:03,460
He like spit his child on me.

2655
02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:11,500
He like threw his child on my body.

2656
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:13,600
That's fucking gross.

2657
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:15,780
Alright, I got the tram pass.

2658
02:58:16,820 --> 02:58:19,040
Okay, now do I just go all the way back, right?

2659
02:58:20,740 --> 02:58:23,120
I know he just threw his child.

2660
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:26,880
He didn't want to take care of it anymore.

2661
02:58:30,780 --> 02:58:31,260
Yeah.

2662
02:58:32,740 --> 02:58:33,680
Let's go this way.

2663
02:58:35,360 --> 02:58:35,800

2664
02:58:43,440 --> 02:58:45,040

02:58:50,260 --> 02:58:52,060
We go this way now.

2667
02:58:53,320 --> 02:58:54,380
Whoa, where am I?

2668
02:58:55,180 --> 02:58:55,840
Oh, shit.

2669
02:58:57,060 --> 02:58:57,420

2672
02:59:36,570 --> 02:59:37,750
Of course he spits up.

2673
02:59:38,210 --> 02:59:39,150
Oh my god, of course.

2674
02:59:41,150 --> 02:59:42,670
Gets like a little ledge here.

2675
02:59:47,870 --> 02:59:49,310
Is this where he lives?

2676
02:59:52,430 --> 02:59:53,850
Okay, no, not here.

2677
02:59:54,090 --> 02:59:54,830
Oh, right here.

2678
02:59:56,270 --> 02:59:57,750
Is this where Zot is?

2679
02:59:58,450 --> 02:59:58,810
Zot?

2680
03:00:00,590 --> 03:00:01,190
Are you here?

2681
03:00:01,310 --> 03:00:01,610
Zot?

2682
03:00:04,190 --> 03:00:05,190
Oh, there he is.

2683
03:00:05,450 --> 03:00:06,890
You're gonna go.

2684
03:00:07,010 --> 03:00:08,470
Oh, they're all like spotted.

2685
03:00:09,710 --> 03:00:11,710
Oh my, I just noticed that there's spiders.

2686
03:00:13,890 --> 03:00:17,290
Because we haven't seen, like, an actual spider bug yet that we've killed.

2687
03:00:17,790 --> 03:00:21,170
So I'm pretty sure the next boss is a fucking spider boss, isn't it?

2688
03:00:22,190 --> 03:00:23,870
It's a spider boss.

2689
03:00:25,250 --> 03:00:26,410
I can feel it.

2690
03:00:27,510 --> 03:00:28,690
Yeah, they're little spiders.

2691
03:00:41,020 --> 03:00:43,620
Where the fuck is the Zode passageway?

2692
03:00:45,660 --> 03:00:48,900
I guess that's a spider, but, like...

2693
03:00:48,900 --> 03:00:49,560
Oh, okay.

2694
03:00:49,580 --> 03:00:57,960
I just realized this guy's also a spider Because he has eight legs, I think But we haven't seen like a spider boss yet

2695
03:01:02,580 --> 03:01:05,720
Okay, oh Wait, I'm back here What the fuck?

2696
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:24,060

Wow!

2698
03:01:33,060 --> 03:01:36,220
I made so much progress, everyone.

2699
03:01:40,060 --> 03:01:41,240
Oh, I hear him crawling.

2700
03:01:43,680 --> 03:01:44,480
There he is.

2701
03:01:47,180 --> 03:01:49,060
Okay, I just gotta go left this time.

2702
03:01:53,600 --> 03:01:55,300
Oh, I thought it was this way.

2703
03:01:56,220 --> 03:01:57,880
How the fuck did this guy die?

2704
03:01:59,240 --> 03:02:00,200
How do I...

2705
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:01,660
Oh my gosh, I'm so confused.

2706
03:02:02,220 --> 03:02:03,620
Okay, we gotta go up.

2707
03:02:04,400 --> 03:02:05,520
And then left.

2708
03:02:07,300 --> 03:02:07,960
This time.

2709
03:02:11,860 --> 03:02:14,640
Okay, this time we go left instead.

2710
03:02:18,400 --> 03:02:19,600
And then...

2711
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:20,920
Yeah, we go full left.

2712
03:02:21,460 --> 03:02:21,760
Ow.

2713
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:28,400
There we go, full left this time.

2714
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:38,180
Oh, I don't like the sound they make when they're crotlit, when they're running away.

2715
03:02:39,060 --> 03:02:39,680
Oh, shit.

2716
03:02:39,900 --> 03:02:40,640
What the fuck?

2717
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:41,800
Oh, my God.

2718
03:02:42,100 --> 03:02:43,460
What the fuck?

2719
03:02:43,820 --> 03:02:45,700
I was not ready for that.

2720
03:02:48,980 --> 03:02:51,880
He literally just randomly showed up in my game.

2721
03:02:55,060 --> 03:02:56,640
What the fuck?

2722
03:02:57,920 --> 03:02:59,080
You win.

2723
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:02,360
I'll come back later.

2724
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:04,280
You can stay there.

2725
03:03:04,600 --> 03:03:05,520
I'll come back.

2726
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:08,500
Let me just farm some HP.

2727
03:03:12,780 --> 03:03:14,040
Okay, I shadow...

2728
03:03:14,040 --> 03:03:14,920
Oh, I can shadow dash.

2729
03:03:15,080 --> 03:03:15,440
I forgot.

2730
03:03:15,900 --> 03:03:17,140
I forgot about my shadow dash.

2731
03:03:18,420 --> 03:03:19,940
I'm using like...

2732
03:03:19,940 --> 03:03:20,620
Like...

2733
03:03:20,620 --> 03:03:21,440
Okay, never mind.

2734
03:03:21,580 --> 03:03:22,120
He's dead anyway.

2735
03:03:22,500 --> 03:03:22,820
Okay.

2736
03:03:25,540 --> 03:03:26,820
That works anyway.

2737
03:03:27,380 --> 03:03:27,660
Whatever.

2738
03:03:31,120 --> 03:03:32,820
It still works.

2739
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:37,320
Oh, is that a hidden area?

2740
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:39,600
Oh, it is.

2741
03:03:40,900 --> 03:03:42,760
Oh, I didn't have to fight him.

2742
03:03:51,430 --> 03:03:53,010
Okay, now they're all just spiders.

2743
03:03:53,410 --> 03:03:54,630
Okay, now this is just spiders.

2744
03:03:54,770 --> 03:03:56,750
The boss has to be a giant fucking spider.

2745
03:04:00,330 --> 03:04:01,570
I could feel it.

2746
03:04:03,690 --> 03:04:05,590
I could feel the spider boss.

2747
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:12,260
Wait, there's a grub above me.

2748
03:04:13,820 --> 03:04:14,840
How do I get above there?

2749
03:04:16,940 --> 03:04:18,200
Oh, I don't think I can yet.

2750
03:04:22,350 --> 03:04:22,990
Unless here?

2751
03:04:23,210 --> 03:04:23,870
Oh, I'm here.

2752
03:04:25,690 --> 03:04:26,050
What?

2753
03:04:26,670 --> 03:04:28,710
Oh, it's because I dashed already.

2754
03:04:29,230 --> 03:04:30,070
Oh, okay.

2755
03:04:30,670 --> 03:04:32,150
I was like, wait, why can't I do it?

2756
03:04:32,310 --> 03:04:33,470
Why can't I dash him?

2757
03:04:34,650 --> 03:04:35,770
Oh, this guy is annoying.

2758
03:04:36,450 --> 03:04:37,910
I'm going to try the dash thing again.

2759
03:04:38,590 --> 03:04:39,430
Yeah, never mind.

2760
03:04:39,910 --> 03:04:40,890
I don't have enough range.

2761
03:04:41,490 --> 03:04:42,010
What the fuck?

2762
03:04:52,090 --> 03:04:53,030
Okay, let's get it.

2763
03:04:53,030 --> 03:04:53,570
Oh, of course.

2764
03:04:53,690 --> 03:04:54,670
Of course that hits me.

2765
03:04:55,350 --> 03:04:56,310
Yeah, it doesn't work, guys.

2766
03:04:56,390 --> 03:04:58,270
Who told me to do the shadow step?

2767
03:05:00,130 --> 03:05:01,090
You lied.

2768
03:05:03,570 --> 03:05:04,910
It didn't work.

2769
03:05:11,150 --> 03:05:11,410
Oh.

2770
03:05:11,970 --> 03:05:13,330
Wait, he's fucking chipped.

2771
03:05:13,430 --> 03:05:14,450
Are you serious?

2772
03:05:14,690 --> 03:05:15,470
He does three.

2773
03:05:15,530 --> 03:05:17,410
He does three slant.

2774
03:05:17,490 --> 03:05:18,150
Okay, we're leaving.

2775
03:05:18,250 --> 03:05:19,150
You can have that area.

2776
03:05:19,590 --> 03:05:20,270
We're leaving.

2777
03:05:21,570 --> 03:05:22,030
You win.

2778
03:05:27,330 --> 03:05:34,970

2781
03:05:54,840 --> 03:06:00,960
Oh my god The one life and a dream right now The one Live in the dream.

2782
03:06:02,300 --> 03:06:03,960
The deep nest, baby.

2783
03:06:07,720 --> 03:06:09,120
Oops, saw spikes.

2784
03:06:20,860 --> 03:06:21,720
Oh my god.

2785
03:06:22,380 --> 03:06:23,100
He wins.

2786
03:06:23,420 --> 03:06:24,260
He wins.

2787
03:06:24,900 --> 03:06:25,540
He wins.

2788
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:31,100
Okay, I got the grub.

2789
03:06:39,180 --> 03:06:39,500
Goodness.

2790
03:06:41,920 --> 03:06:44,300
Oh, yeah, I have a feeling I need the...

2791
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:45,380
What is it?

2792
03:06:45,620 --> 03:06:48,380
The shadow charm that makes me dash further.

2793
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:52,920
Because I don't think I can do a dash with my current setup.

2794
03:06:54,620 --> 03:06:55,940
Like to dash past him.

2795
03:06:56,320 --> 03:06:59,480
Unless I'm like, I space it out correctly.

2796
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:03,280
But even then I feel like it's so hard to space it out.

2797
03:07:11,460 --> 03:07:12,320
He just wins.

2798
03:07:12,440 --> 03:07:13,800
Like he's just better than me.

2799
03:07:16,240 --> 03:07:17,120
Are you serious?

2800
03:07:19,380 --> 03:07:20,060
I'm like.

2801
03:07:20,300 --> 03:07:22,270
God, I'm trying to figure out how to kill this guy.

2802
03:07:29,150 --> 03:07:29,430
Oh.

2803
03:07:33,120 --> 03:07:34,500
Oh, thank you for this, Solus.

03:07:35,280 --> 03:07:36,420
Thank you for the HP.

2805
03:07:37,140 --> 03:07:38,540
Oh, that looks like a spot.

2806
03:07:38,680 --> 03:07:38,960
Oh!

2807
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:42,780
I hate this area.

2808
03:07:43,020 --> 03:07:45,700
I hate this area so much.

2809
03:07:48,440 --> 03:07:48,980

03:08:43,130 --> 03:08:46,570
Okay, I feel like the ball of yarn is the boss fight.

2816
03:08:47,370 --> 03:08:47,990
Oh, there it is.

2817
03:08:50,770 --> 03:08:52,470
Oh, goodbye, bench.

2818
03:08:55,390 --> 03:08:56,790
Oh, they broke my bench.

2819
03:08:57,210 --> 03:08:59,070
Guess I don't get the fucking rest.

2820
03:09:02,270 --> 03:09:06,690
But just in case, I'm gonna go to the stag, beater.

2821
03:09:07,590 --> 03:09:08,110
I...

2822
03:09:08,950 --> 03:09:09,550
I don't know.

2823
03:09:09,650 --> 03:09:10,930
I'll just get to resting ground.

2824
03:09:11,930 --> 03:09:12,590
Bench in the house?

2825
03:09:12,710 --> 03:09:12,830
Okay.

2826
03:09:13,010 --> 03:09:15,150
Just in case I get one guide.

2827
03:09:15,930 --> 03:09:18,250
I'm going to go to the bench in this random area.

2828
03:09:19,670 --> 03:09:20,370
And then.

2829
03:09:22,310 --> 03:09:23,310
And then.

2830
03:09:23,770 --> 03:09:25,170
I'll go to the back.

2831
03:09:28,780 --> 03:09:29,700
Just in case.

2832
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:31,760
I have trust issues now.

2833
03:09:35,180 --> 03:09:37,660
Can't believe they would break my bench like that.

2834
03:09:38,120 --> 03:09:38,760
What the fuck?

2835
03:09:38,840 --> 03:09:40,300
The government paid for my bench.

2836
03:09:40,320 --> 03:10:01,180
my tax pay my tax paying dollars pay for this bench how dare you hello oh hey there is a bench yay oh oh that was the trap oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh wait sir sir

2838
03:10:46,710 --> 03:10:48,150
Oh, Nassia.

2839
03:10:54,190 --> 03:10:55,310
To be fair, we didn't lie.

2840
03:10:55,450 --> 03:10:57,170
There was a bench in there.

2841
03:10:57,890 --> 03:10:59,350
Thank you for the super chat, Liam.

2842
03:10:59,750 --> 03:11:00,710
Thank you, thank you.

2843
03:11:01,130 --> 03:11:04,970
To be fair, there was a bench, Mr. Muffluckins.

2844
03:11:05,050 --> 03:11:06,290
Thank you for the super chat.

2845
03:11:06,410 --> 03:11:06,750
Thank you.

2846
03:11:06,930 --> 03:11:07,790
Thank you.

2847
03:11:09,950 --> 03:11:11,190
I knew it.

2848
03:11:11,470 --> 03:11:12,550
Another reason.

2849
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:21,660
The fact that it says double hit, fucking sucks.

2850
03:11:39,880 --> 03:11:41,320
Knock knock.

2851
03:11:41,780 --> 03:11:42,280
Oh, shit!

2852
03:11:47,460 --> 03:11:48,000
Oh, nice.

2853
03:11:48,200 --> 03:11:48,660
Knock knock.

2854
03:11:49,740 --> 03:11:50,900
Good distance.

2855
03:11:51,680 --> 03:11:53,400
I don't want to waste my healing.

2856
03:11:53,420 --> 03:11:54,520
spell on him.

2857
03:11:58,100 --> 03:12:01,820
Because he does, the thing is, he does double damage, and I'm getting so scared.

2858
03:12:03,080 --> 03:12:04,520
Oh my gosh, where does this go?

2859
03:12:05,860 --> 03:12:07,000
Wait, where does this go?

2860
03:12:08,080 --> 03:12:09,320
Oh, is this just a shortcut?

2861
03:12:09,400 --> 03:12:10,040
Oh, it's a shortcut.

2862
03:12:13,300 --> 03:12:15,040
Oh, I like that.

2863
03:12:16,160 --> 03:12:17,660
That statue looks scary.

2864
03:12:21,640 --> 03:12:22,020
Eh.

2865
03:12:23,740 --> 03:12:24,920
I hear a heartbeat.

2866
03:12:26,200 --> 03:12:48,200
whose heartbeat is that oh my god not you again knock knock I'm gonna do this now wait what it hurt me wait what hurt me yeah like what hurt me there

2867
03:12:54,020 --> 03:13:02,260
oh it reached me I didn't even realize he oh my god this goddamn fucking range I didn't even notice that that reached me.

2868
03:13:05,680 --> 03:13:06,280
Okay.

2869
03:13:06,900 --> 03:13:07,760
So one more here.

2870
03:13:12,090 --> 03:13:13,650
I don't trust going down.

2871
03:13:13,750 --> 03:13:15,310
I feel like down is just like...

2872
03:13:15,310 --> 03:13:17,890
It opens like either spikes or a shortcut.

2873
03:13:20,970 --> 03:13:21,570
Here?

2874
03:13:22,790 --> 03:13:23,990
That is...

2875
03:13:23,990 --> 03:13:27,630
That's either a grub or like those little wing things.

2876
03:13:29,110 --> 03:13:30,490
That seems like a trap grub.

2877
03:13:31,350 --> 03:13:32,430
Oh my god, he was a...

2878
03:13:32,450 --> 03:13:45,930
real grub thought it was a trap it was just so easy the fact that he was just there with nothing to guard him

2879
03:13:51,100 --> 03:14:08,240
okay oh my god are you serious look at this guy okay nice oh I actually have to like shoot me left and right.

2880
03:14:12,310 --> 03:14:14,230
Can I go this way?

2881
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:19,980
No!

2882
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:28,080
Oh no.

2883
03:14:33,300 --> 03:14:36,840
I'm not using

2884
03:14:50,300 --> 03:14:51,020
magic here.

2885
03:14:51,400 --> 03:14:52,720
I need to heal.

2886
03:14:55,640 --> 03:14:57,680
Jesus Christ, he takes fucking forever.

2887
03:14:59,960 --> 03:15:00,620
Back up.

2888
03:15:01,340 --> 03:15:02,140
Fuck it.

2889
03:15:02,760 --> 03:15:03,600
I'm gonna use that.

2890
03:15:03,660 --> 03:15:04,280
I gave up.

2891
03:15:04,940 --> 03:15:05,920
This took too long.

2892
03:15:06,760 --> 03:15:07,400
Oh, now I'm here.

2893
03:15:07,480 --> 03:15:08,460
Oh, there he is.

2894
03:15:10,360 --> 03:15:11,200
Oh, I made it!

2895
03:15:13,800 --> 03:15:14,200
Dream!

2896
03:15:15,820 --> 03:15:17,660
Oh, I should have talked to him first.

2897
03:15:17,780 --> 03:15:18,200
Oh, sorry.

2898
03:15:19,380 --> 03:15:20,560
I forgot to talk to him.

2899
03:15:20,940 --> 03:15:22,240
I just went straight for murder.

2900
03:15:28,540 --> 03:15:30,720
Bound for brood for child.

2901
03:15:32,400 --> 03:15:52,400
fair bargain made give all for her for her for her all right I'll give her the London special here we go

2902
03:15:59,720 --> 03:16:09,420
yay oh focus time get inside okay Oh my god, actual progress.

2903
03:16:09,700 --> 03:16:12,060
Now we're making actual progress.

2904
03:16:13,820 --> 03:16:15,200
Oh, that's Hornet's mom?

2905
03:16:15,840 --> 03:16:16,240
Damn.

2906
03:16:17,520 --> 03:16:18,300
She's sick.

2907
03:16:18,560 --> 03:16:19,380
Compared to her.

2908
03:16:24,540 --> 03:16:25,220
Oh, I should have...

2909
03:16:25,220 --> 03:16:27,420
If you told me earlier, I would have been Jane Silksong.

2910
03:16:29,680 --> 03:16:31,720
Could have been Jane Silksong there.

2911
03:16:32,320 --> 03:16:34,040
I could have stabbed my mom.

2912
03:16:34,880 --> 03:16:36,740
And that you have one boss left, the final one.

2913
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:38,280
In the temple of the black egg.

2914
03:16:38,660 --> 03:16:39,600
Liam, they give us Super Chat.

2915
03:16:39,660 --> 03:16:40,160
Oh, hi.

2916
03:16:40,700 --> 03:16:42,160
It's not about your mom.

2917
03:16:45,160 --> 03:16:48,520
So you slain the beast and you head towards that faded goal.

2918
03:16:49,500 --> 03:16:53,560
And now I've obstructed this happening, but it caused me some pain to knowingly stand idle.

2919
03:16:54,600 --> 03:16:54,600
What?

2920
03:16:54,960 --> 03:16:57,780
You might think me stern, but I'm not completely cold.

2921
03:16:58,480 --> 03:17:02,960
We do not choose our mothers or their circumstance into which we are born.

2922
03:17:03,620 --> 03:17:08,160
Despite all the ills of this world, I am thankful for the life she granted me.

2923
03:17:10,460 --> 03:17:16,260
Only allowing her to pass And taking the burden of the future and her said Can I begin to repay this?

2924
03:17:17,400 --> 03:17:18,420
Alright, what do you, how do you feel?

2925
03:17:19,180 --> 03:17:21,100
Mother, I give mine action.

2926
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:23,340
But another path may be possible.

2927
03:17:23,560 --> 03:17:24,100
Alright, guys.

2928
03:17:24,520 --> 03:17:26,180
Here's, alright, here are...

2929
03:17:26,180 --> 03:17:26,480
Okay.

2930
03:17:27,440 --> 03:17:30,420
Technically, we can get the first ending now.

2931
03:17:31,240 --> 03:17:34,220
And then we'll do the true ending Next week.

2932
03:17:34,440 --> 03:17:35,260
Before Silk's on.

2933
03:17:35,320 --> 03:17:36,500
Guys, I can do one more part.

2934
03:17:36,580 --> 03:17:38,460
And we can try and gather all the true ending stuff.

2935
03:17:39,220 --> 03:17:39,660
Or...

2936
03:17:40,680 --> 03:17:42,680
Actually, wait, do you think I get true ending?

2937
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:53,160
I can get the true ending uh uh next in one try in one playthrough or get the first ending now

2938
03:17:57,920 --> 03:17:59,800
go for it now no?

2939
03:18:00,260 --> 03:18:10,460
Alright, let's go fight the let's go get the first ending then alright, then we'll get the first ending oh fuck, there's of course there's Spice, hello

2940
03:18:13,760 --> 03:18:14,340
Hello.

2941
03:18:16,020 --> 03:18:16,260
Alright.

2942
03:18:16,620 --> 03:18:18,400
Then we'll get the first ending.

2943
03:18:20,880 --> 03:18:22,720
And then we'll do the...

2944
03:18:22,720 --> 03:18:24,380
Sorry, I made a little oopsie there.

2945
03:18:24,660 --> 03:18:25,860
You didn't see that.

2946
03:18:26,340 --> 03:18:26,700
Jane.

2947
03:18:31,150 --> 03:18:32,970
I don't even know how to get back.

2948
03:18:33,550 --> 03:18:35,090
I'm just like...

2949
03:18:35,090 --> 03:18:36,950
How do I get back?

2950
03:18:38,970 --> 03:18:39,550
Wait.

2951
03:18:40,370 --> 03:18:41,990
Aren't I trapped in...

2952
03:18:42,890 --> 03:18:45,510
Oh, left was the way out.

2953
03:18:45,890 --> 03:18:47,930
I was like, oh, wait a minute.

2954
03:18:48,030 --> 03:18:49,810
How do I get out of here?

2955
03:18:50,210 --> 03:18:56,570
Jamie, David, yeah, I'm sorry I killed your mom, but like, how do I leave this place?

2956
03:18:58,310 --> 03:19:00,630
She never told me how to leave.

2957
03:19:04,350 --> 03:19:04,790
Okay.

2958
03:19:06,910 --> 03:19:08,790
It's on the left side, this side.

2959
03:19:12,250 --> 03:19:15,410
I just realized, yeah, I was like, wait a minute, how do I get out of here?

2960
03:19:18,550 --> 03:19:19,610
Oh, here's the bench.

2961
03:19:20,090 --> 03:19:20,090
Nice.

2962
03:19:22,030 --> 03:19:22,310
Alright.

2963
03:19:22,990 --> 03:19:24,230
Now I go down.

2964
03:19:24,930 --> 03:19:25,490
Did I get out?

2965
03:19:25,590 --> 03:19:26,050
Oh, shit.

2966
03:19:26,190 --> 03:19:26,890
They all died.

2967
03:19:27,710 --> 03:19:28,870
Wait, what happened to them?

2968
03:19:29,710 --> 03:19:30,670
They're all gone.

2969
03:19:32,590 --> 03:19:34,710
Oh my god, and the bench is gone, too.

2970
03:19:35,590 --> 03:19:36,930
Alright, let's get the first ending.

2971
03:19:40,650 --> 03:19:41,070
Okay.

2972
03:19:43,390 --> 03:19:44,370
They weren't real.

2973
03:19:44,470 --> 03:19:45,510
It was just all in my head.

2974
03:19:45,570 --> 03:19:46,390
I fucking knew you.

2975
03:19:46,650 --> 03:19:48,450
I thank God I went to that bench.

2976
03:19:49,010 --> 03:19:51,950
Thank God I went to a random bench here.

2977
03:19:54,290 --> 03:19:54,890
But...

2978
03:19:54,890 --> 03:19:55,990
Wait, Zoet died?

2979
03:19:56,790 --> 03:19:57,850
Wait, we killed him?

2980
03:20:01,070 --> 03:20:02,310
No, it's okay.

2981
03:20:02,450 --> 03:20:03,470
It'll be fine, right?

2982
03:20:04,070 --> 03:20:05,490
I said I'll BRB.

2983
03:20:07,370 --> 03:20:11,190
Wait, no, we don't know that.

2984
03:20:11,390 --> 03:20:12,930
Guys, we don't know that.

2985
03:20:13,150 --> 03:20:16,150
Maybe he married a lovely spider lady.

2986
03:20:16,870 --> 03:20:17,470
Maybe...

2987
03:20:17,470 --> 03:20:18,750
It'll be fine.

2988
03:20:20,130 --> 03:20:21,750
Don't worry guys.

2989
03:20:22,170 --> 03:20:22,930
He'll be fine.

2990
03:20:23,030 --> 03:20:23,930
We don't know.

2991
03:20:24,130 --> 03:20:28,950
We never came back for him, but But he's fine.

2992
03:20:29,210 --> 03:20:31,850
He'll be I bet you he's like he's okay

2993
03:20:35,880 --> 03:20:44,420
You don't know that maybe he met a lovely spider lady It'll be fine

2994
03:20:50,620 --> 03:20:53,980
Doki stop coping he'll be okay.

2995
03:20:54,260 --> 03:21:25,580
Okay, we gotta figure out okay it has to be like the it's like what this one right the big black thing in the middle that looks that really does look like final boss thing like oh so went to go visit the farm yeah he just went to the farm of stay it should be fine we don't need gathering swarm we don't need compass.

2996
03:21:26,400 --> 03:21:27,100
You don't need that.

2997
03:21:27,460 --> 03:21:29,680
Okay, what should our, should we get shot?

2998
03:21:29,860 --> 03:21:33,020
Okay, we need, should we get the, oh, we can't do soul eater.

2999
03:21:34,640 --> 03:21:36,740
We can get rid of set, do we need steady body?

3000
03:21:36,860 --> 03:21:43,340
We can get steady body and grab soul eater and then have like a magic build too.

3001
03:21:44,180 --> 03:21:44,800
Quick slash?

3002
03:21:45,460 --> 03:21:46,740
Is steady body that important?

3003
03:21:47,880 --> 03:21:49,420
Oh, helps me stay alive?

3004
03:21:49,600 --> 03:21:49,840
Okay.

3005
03:21:51,380 --> 03:22:19,570

3006
03:22:29,870 --> 03:22:30,270
Yeah.

3007
03:22:34,060 --> 03:22:35,620
Gotta make sure I got everything.

3008
03:22:37,400 --> 03:22:37,580
Wait.

3009
03:22:38,940 --> 03:22:39,420
Oh, okay.

3010
03:22:39,600 --> 03:22:40,460
Mark of pride.

3011
03:22:40,800 --> 03:22:42,620
Wait, do I get mark of pride or...

3012
03:22:42,620 --> 03:22:43,640
Oh, it's a better one.

3013
03:22:43,760 --> 03:22:44,280
Oh, okay.

3014
03:22:44,360 --> 03:22:45,020
I wasn't sure.

3015
03:22:45,740 --> 03:22:46,720
I didn't realize that, too.

3016
03:22:48,400 --> 03:22:49,240
They were both...

3017
03:22:49,240 --> 03:22:50,140
They both looked like...

3018
03:22:50,140 --> 03:22:51,380
I thought it was just one charm.

3019
03:22:52,100 --> 03:22:53,520
Okay, I'll get that then.

3020
03:22:58,480 --> 03:22:58,880
Alright.

3021
03:23:00,260 --> 03:23:01,700
Oh, they also stab it.

3022
03:23:01,700 --> 03:23:02,260
Doesn't matter.

3023
03:23:03,280 --> 03:23:03,800
I can only get...

3024
03:23:03,820 --> 03:23:04,680
one anyway.

3025
03:23:11,900 --> 03:23:13,300
Ooh, that is long range.

3026
03:23:15,080 --> 03:23:16,780
Yeah, but I can't afford to.

3027
03:23:17,860 --> 03:23:20,320
Alright, we'll do the, we'll get the first ending.

3028
03:23:23,220 --> 03:23:23,640
Hello!

3029
03:23:25,440 --> 03:23:27,780
I'm here to kill you, I guess.

3030
03:23:28,080 --> 03:23:29,520
Just like how I killed the others.

3031
03:23:30,540 --> 03:23:33,200
Well, I'm here to give you a good old welcome to London.

3032
03:23:38,880 --> 03:23:39,740
There's a bench here?

3033
03:23:40,540 --> 03:23:41,540
Where's the bench?

3034
03:23:44,680 --> 03:23:46,040
Oh, that'll just go inside.

3035
03:23:46,640 --> 03:23:47,920
What's the worst that could happen?

3036
03:23:49,420 --> 03:23:51,980
I don't think I can first try a final boss, guys.

3037
03:23:56,600 --> 03:23:58,900
We'll see how long this will take me.

3038
03:24:05,220 --> 03:24:05,520
Oh.

3039
03:24:06,780 --> 03:24:08,700
Yeah, no, I'm not first trying this.

3040
03:24:12,210 --> 03:24:12,870
Is that my bench?

3041
03:24:12,990 --> 03:24:13,830
Oh, that's my bench.

3042
03:24:14,530 --> 03:24:16,170
Is any rock a bench now?

3043
03:24:16,510 --> 03:24:17,130
My god.

3044
03:24:17,390 --> 03:24:17,810
I have loads.

3045
03:24:17,830 --> 03:24:21,590
Of those standards, that does not look like a bench.

3046
03:24:25,450 --> 03:24:27,610
Oh, break this, I guess.

3047
03:24:28,410 --> 03:24:29,170
Oh, there he is.

3048
03:24:29,410 --> 03:24:29,650
Hello.

3049
03:24:31,470 --> 03:24:33,590
So I hear you're the Hollow Knight.

3050
03:24:35,330 --> 03:24:38,110
If I kill you, I become the Hollow Knight.

3051
03:24:43,210 --> 03:24:44,010
Hello, sir.

3052
03:24:46,530 --> 03:24:47,110
Hello?

3053
03:24:49,850 --> 03:24:50,430
That's...

3054
03:24:50,450 --> 03:24:51,470
John Hollow Knight?

3055
03:24:51,730 --> 03:24:52,610
Why is he so tall?

3056
03:24:52,770 --> 03:24:53,590
It's not fair.

3057
03:24:58,250 --> 03:24:59,270
Oh, shit.

3058
03:25:00,010 --> 03:25:01,770
My timing is fucked right now.

3059
03:25:03,690 --> 03:25:04,650
Wait, can I heal from here?

3060
03:25:04,890 --> 03:25:05,170
Hey.

3061
03:25:07,170 --> 03:25:08,810
He's like, no!

3062
03:25:11,690 --> 03:25:12,590
That's fucked.

3063
03:25:16,790 --> 03:25:18,150
Okay, I can heal, though.

3064
03:25:21,070 --> 03:25:22,410
Oh, what?

3065
03:25:22,490 --> 03:25:23,350
What?

3066
03:25:23,370 --> 03:25:26,870
What the fuck was that?

3067
03:25:31,900 --> 03:25:32,260
Okay.

3068
03:25:33,580 --> 03:25:34,640
I don't like that move.

3069
03:25:38,500 --> 03:25:39,220
Okay.

3070
03:25:42,340 --> 03:25:43,800
Yeah, I think he...

3071
03:25:43,800 --> 03:25:45,380
I definitely can't first try this.

3072
03:25:45,680 --> 03:25:47,300
Yeah, this... That move...

3073
03:25:47,300 --> 03:25:49,180
That explosion fucked me over.

3074
03:25:50,980 --> 03:25:52,820
That explosion fucked me over.

3075
03:25:53,860 --> 03:25:54,660
How's that...

3076
03:25:56,440 --> 03:25:56,880
Okay.

3077
03:25:59,500 --> 03:26:00,780
I don't know how to deal.

3078
03:26:00,900 --> 03:26:02,200
Do I just dash into him?

3079
03:26:02,820 --> 03:26:04,180
I didn't see the explosion from...

3080
03:26:04,180 --> 03:26:06,280
It went by so fast, I didn't see the explosion.

3081
03:26:08,100 --> 03:26:08,680
Oh my god.

3082
03:26:08,980 --> 03:26:09,800
What the fuck?

3083
03:26:10,500 --> 03:26:11,840
How did I not hit that?

3084
03:26:15,040 --> 03:26:15,480
Okay.

3085
03:26:22,520 --> 03:26:22,960
Okay.

3086
03:26:26,590 --> 03:26:26,910
Okay.

3087
03:26:29,190 --> 03:26:29,950
I hate...

3088
03:26:29,950 --> 03:26:30,990
Oh my god.

3089
03:26:32,070 --> 03:26:32,370
Nice.

3090
03:26:32,570 --> 03:26:32,910
I can heal.

3091
03:26:32,930 --> 03:26:35,790
I can grab two heals too.

3092
03:26:36,570 --> 03:26:38,410
Do I dash into that when he...

3093
03:26:38,410 --> 03:26:44,400
Oh my god.

3094
03:26:44,640 --> 03:26:46,440
He TP's when I was supposed to...

3095
03:26:46,440 --> 03:26:47,980
I was trying to pogo him.

3096
03:26:48,420 --> 03:26:49,580
Oh my god.

3097
03:26:50,060 --> 03:26:51,940
I wanted to pogo him.

3098
03:26:57,440 --> 03:26:58,400
That was bullshit.

3099
03:27:00,740 --> 03:27:02,060
A fucking course.

3100
03:27:03,400 --> 03:27:04,360
Oh, I see it now.

3101
03:27:05,500 --> 03:27:06,300
I see it.

3102
03:27:13,320 --> 03:27:13,920
That's...

3103
03:27:13,940 --> 03:27:52,740
thing fucks with me oh I understand it but like it's the explosion it's the explosion I like when he screams I'm like okay oh all right okay oh Fucking course, you dash again.

3104
03:27:54,620 --> 03:27:54,940
Oh.

3105
03:28:01,120 --> 03:28:01,600
Okay.

3106
03:28:02,940 --> 03:28:03,620
There you go.

3107
03:28:03,860 --> 03:28:04,380
At least I can heal.

3108
03:28:09,340 --> 03:28:10,420
Okay, I see it.

3109
03:28:11,180 --> 03:28:13,780
I have to be, like, on the ground when he does that.

3110
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:15,320
I need to remember to be on the ground.

3111
03:28:17,300 --> 03:28:17,680
Okay.

3112
03:28:22,340 --> 03:28:23,120
Okay, nice.

3113
03:28:30,880 --> 03:28:31,900
Nice, I can heal.

3114
03:28:35,450 --> 03:28:35,930
Okay.

3115
03:28:41,960 --> 03:28:42,360
Okay.

3116
03:28:46,140 --> 03:28:47,760
Oh, that was literally on me.

3117
03:28:48,060 --> 03:28:48,440
I...

3118
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:49,800
That's unlucky.

3119
03:28:51,040 --> 03:28:52,780
He was literally on me when that happened.

3120
03:28:55,580 --> 03:28:55,900
Okay, nice.

3121
03:29:02,310 --> 03:29:02,950
Oh, new move.

3122
03:29:03,110 --> 03:29:03,630
New move.

3123
03:29:04,370 --> 03:29:05,310
Can I heal when he does that?

3124
03:29:06,010 --> 03:29:06,390
Nice.

3125
03:29:08,010 --> 03:29:09,250
I don't know what he did.

3126
03:29:09,710 --> 03:29:10,110
I...

3127
03:29:10,110 --> 03:29:11,850
Oh, I don't like this!

3128
03:29:11,850 --> 03:29:12,610
I don't like this move!

3129
03:29:12,890 --> 03:29:13,730
I don't like it!

3130
03:29:13,790 --> 03:29:14,630
Oh, it's so oh!

Not Toho!

3134
03:29:22,180 --> 03:29:27,080
I don't know what to do with you Toho!

3135
03:29:31,560 --> 03:29:32,800
Oh god, not Toho.

3136
03:29:34,920 --> 03:29:35,520
Okay.

3137
03:29:36,460 --> 03:29:37,040
Okay.

3138
03:29:45,210 --> 03:29:45,870
Oh god.

3139
03:29:46,310 --> 03:29:46,530
Oh god.

3140
03:29:49,710 --> 03:29:49,990
No!

3141
03:29:50,330 --> 03:29:50,930
No you don't understand!

03:30:02,340 --> 03:30:03,400
Oh my god.

3144
03:30:03,520 --> 03:30:05,660
I'm so bad when it comes to Toho.

3145
03:30:13,570 --> 03:30:14,110
Okay.

3146
03:30:28,560 --> 03:30:29,260

Okay, I can heal.

03:30:46,930 --> 03:30:49,350
Okay, that should not have hit me.

03:32:15,170 --> 03:32:15,930
I did it.

3174
03:32:15,970 --> 03:32:17,370
I saved everyone.

3175
03:32:25,180 --> 03:32:26,360
Uh, wait, I am John.

3176
03:32:26,460 --> 03:32:27,780
Oh my god, Piccadino Vessa!

3177
03:32:28,260 --> 03:32:30,280
Crokey would have finished it fast.

3178
03:32:30,300 --> 03:32:31,420
Oh, thanks.

3179
03:32:31,500 --> 03:32:32,960
Thank you for the super chat.

3180
03:32:33,320 --> 03:32:33,520
Thank you.

3181
03:32:33,900 --> 03:32:34,300
Thank you.

3182
03:32:34,580 --> 03:32:37,320
Yeah, I'm John Hollow Knight now.

3183
03:32:38,860 --> 03:32:39,380
It's a second.

3184
03:32:39,460 --> 03:32:40,940
Okay, it's the second worst ending.

3185
03:32:41,160 --> 03:32:43,100
That's not the worst ending, guys.

3186
03:32:43,420 --> 03:32:45,900
It's only the second worst ending.

3187
03:32:46,360 --> 03:32:48,080
Not the worst ending.

3188
03:32:50,740 --> 03:32:52,700
It's not last.

3189
03:32:56,100 --> 03:32:57,960
Gabriel, thank you for the super chat.

3190
03:32:58,220 --> 03:32:58,340
Thank you.

3191
03:32:58,360 --> 03:32:58,660
Thank you.

3192
03:32:58,660 --> 03:33:00,280
You just doomed Hollow Knight.

3193
03:33:00,300 --> 03:33:31,680
congrats yeah but now but i became john hollow knight sacrifices had to be made okay i wanted to be the main character on the cover of the game sacrifices have to be made it's me or hollow nest and i picked me that's fun we're gonna don't worry this is not the last part played This is not the last part for Hollow Knight.

3194
03:33:32,100 --> 03:33:36,040
I will do another part before Silk Song.

3195
03:33:36,380 --> 03:33:38,640
And then we'll see if I don't know if we can get...

3196
03:33:38,640 --> 03:33:38,980
I don't know.

3197
03:33:39,020 --> 03:33:43,140
I'm not sure if we will be able to do everything for the true end.

3198
03:33:43,280 --> 03:33:44,420
But we'll do our best.

3199
03:33:44,720 --> 03:33:51,240
We're going to do our best to do everything for the true ending of Hollow Knight.

3200
03:33:51,620 --> 03:33:52,640
Before Silk Song.

3201
03:33:53,340 --> 03:33:53,860
Yeah.

3202
03:33:54,140 --> 03:33:55,140
Like next week.

3203
03:33:56,780 --> 03:33:59,200
And after then we're going to do it again.

3204
03:34:00,300 --> 03:34:04,160
that true ending is a lot of stuff that's why i'm saying we'll try

3205
03:34:08,700 --> 03:34:30,720
we'll try and then we'll go into silk sock yeah it's doable in one stream patrick we saved all of this meanwhile outside why the heck is their orange group thing still around refugio thank you the super chat thank you thank you go to him among us died for our sins thank you the super chat Thank you.

3206
03:34:31,000 --> 03:34:31,140
Thank you.

3207
03:34:31,260 --> 03:34:37,440
Now do 112% Meep, thank you for the Magenta Super.

3208
03:34:37,960 --> 03:34:38,260
Thank you.

3209
03:34:38,460 --> 03:34:38,940
Thank you.

3210
03:34:39,760 --> 03:34:40,340
Holy fuck.

3211
03:34:40,720 --> 03:34:43,220
What, okay, that is a little crazy though.

3212
03:34:43,460 --> 03:34:45,460
That might be a little crazy.

3213
03:34:48,300 --> 03:34:49,500
But I had a great time.

3214
03:34:49,600 --> 03:34:51,700
I can't believe we were able to beat Hollow Knight.

3215
03:34:53,380 --> 03:34:54,140
I don't know.

3216
03:34:54,220 --> 03:34:54,600
I don't know.

3217
03:34:55,140 --> 03:35:01,700
I'm not sure if we could do 112% But I'll do my best to do the true ending.

3218
03:35:02,200 --> 03:35:06,920
Because everyone is saying that the true ending leads to Silk Song, right?

3219
03:35:10,360 --> 03:35:14,440
True ending is where Silk Song follows up with, right guys?

3220
03:35:14,820 --> 03:35:15,460
Is that right?

3221
03:35:16,840 --> 03:35:17,960
My way, thank you for the super chat.

3222
03:35:18,060 --> 03:35:18,520
Thank you.

3223
03:35:18,540 --> 03:35:19,940
I don't know what my Halloween plans are yet.

3224
03:35:20,360 --> 03:35:20,700
Well done.

3225
03:35:20,800 --> 03:35:21,640
Achieving this great feat.

3226
03:35:21,780 --> 03:35:23,240
You persevered and triumphed.

3227
03:35:23,340 --> 03:35:25,500
Yay, I did it.

3228
03:35:28,740 --> 03:36:00,980
don't know yet no one actually knows okay then we'll just we'll just try it we'll try our best to get the true ending um 58 yeah guys i think we're a bit far off from 112 percent we're a bit we're oh it did in 12 hours wait that's pretty good i heard like an average playthrough was like what 27 hours to get to the end i mean i feel like that's pretty good for 12 yeah guys we're a little bit far off from 112 percent like Yeah,

3229
03:36:01,360 --> 03:36:05,540
just a little bit, yeah Yeah Yeah,

3230
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:30,680
no shade, no reviving Deficit, yeah, we're not doing that Uh, hi, thank you, Mr. Richard, thank you, thank you That was fun though, thank you guys Um, I'm happy we were able to Complete, we completed three parts Um, which was a lot faster, I feel I feel like that's a lot faster than I expected.

3231
03:36:31,200 --> 03:36:35,420
I thought we had to play more next week to actually get to the original, like, the first ending.

3232
03:36:35,840 --> 03:36:41,660
So I'm really happy that we were able to complete so much within three playthroughs.

3233
03:36:41,960 --> 03:36:43,720
And even then, the first playthrough was super short, too.

3234
03:36:43,760 --> 03:36:46,520
I think, like, I think I could have done it in two parts.

3235
03:36:46,780 --> 03:36:50,620
I definitely could have done it in two parts if the first stream wasn't so short.

3236
03:36:51,680 --> 03:36:54,300
And I enjoyed, like, I could have enjoyed instead all the way.

3237
03:36:55,080 --> 03:36:56,620
But it was definitely very addicting.

3238
03:36:56,780 --> 03:36:58,640
I can see why Hell in a Night was so hyped.

3239
03:36:58,740 --> 03:37:05,320
and because I played it just before silk song releases I didn't have to wait seven years

3240
03:37:10,160 --> 03:37:25,060
yay I get my sequel right after I finish holiday night yippee wow you cheater good for you

3241
03:37:28,800 --> 03:37:31,820

3242
03:37:32,420 --> 03:37:32,420
Yay!

3243
03:37:38,140 --> 03:37:40,140
So, had a great time.

3244
03:37:40,240 --> 03:37:42,060
I didn't understand the hype back then.

3245
03:37:42,260 --> 03:37:44,680
Now I now I do.

3246
03:37:46,500 --> 03:37:46,900
What?

3247
03:37:47,420 --> 03:37:49,000
That lucky you.

3248
03:37:52,600 --> 03:37:58,100
So, yeah, at first I didn't really understand the hype, but now, after playing Hollow Knight, I'm like, oh, wait, this is actually really, really fun.

3249
03:37:58,740 --> 03:38:29,720
to try out the sequel for it too so i'm really glad to be able to experience it soon in the next week uh but thank you all for watching guys i had a great time playing um playing holiday for you guys but next week we'll try and get the true ending next week before silk song um so it'll be another long stream and that means okay i'm trying to decide which what other skin to use um but um there is this there is one more skin i really want to use so i'm glad we're doing another part.

3250
03:38:31,940 --> 03:38:37,520
I think that's my favorite thing about doing like, you know, doing like different parts.

3251
03:38:37,740 --> 03:38:38,440
Do not use...

3252
03:38:38,440 --> 03:38:41,660
You don't even know which one I'm gonna use!

3253
03:38:42,120 --> 03:38:45,080
You guys don't even know which one I'm gonna use.

3254
03:38:45,380 --> 03:38:47,500
It couldn't be any of anything.

3255
03:38:47,780 --> 03:38:48,600
It could be anything.

3256
03:38:53,220 --> 03:38:55,880
Um, so I'm super excited.

3257
03:38:56,120 --> 03:39:29,920

I think six souls.

3260
03:39:31,780 --> 03:39:33,720
I've seen a lot of six souls.

3261
03:39:34,340 --> 03:39:35,200
Is that what's called?

3262
03:39:35,560 --> 03:39:37,920
The one where you play a little like wolf thing?

3263
03:39:38,260 --> 03:39:39,320
That looked really, really.

3264
03:39:39,440 --> 03:39:42,020
That looked really, I really liked the art style of that game.

3265
03:39:42,800 --> 03:39:44,860
And the sus night.

3266
