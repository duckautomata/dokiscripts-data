00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,410

I have to remind you guys.

9
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,550
Sunday is my off day.

10
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,230
My body is not used to working on a Sunday, guys.

11
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,030
I gotta remind you all.

12
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,950
This body always is like trained, has been trained to be
like Sunday is off day.

13
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,830
Like, I am the muscle memory.

14
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,870
It's not yet ready right now, so let me live now.

15
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,450
All right, it'll be a show match.

16
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,770
It is, we play three matches, and then I don't know what
else we're going to do after that.

17
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,050
We might just chill a little bit.

18
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,570
I might do some work stuff while I stream.

19
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,530
Devil, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

20
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,630
Thank you, thank you.

21
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,470
Yeah, I think I, I don't know.

22
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,690
I didn't stream all week.

23
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,550
I like, I did like guerrilla streams.

24
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,610
I think majority of my streams were on, well, actually, it's
like half, half.

25
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,830
I was going to say it was like half on Twitch.

26
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,970
Twitch and a half on YouTube.

27
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,950
I didn't warm up at all.

28
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,250
I did Doom queue after my stream.

29
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,460
I had a headache from coughing a lot last night.

30
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
And I was like, you know what's going to fix this?

31
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm going to start Doom queuing.

32
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,280
And you want to know how it went?

33
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,280
I'm almost about to lose Celestial 2.

34
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:50,560
yeah so it didn't go so well it did not go as well as i
thought who would have thought playing video games with a

35
00:05:50,560 --> 00:06:00,440
headache is not a great idea also it was weekend queues no
it was crazy i swear to god the moment i went the moment i

36
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,120
queued up off stream um at the gate like it was back it was
back

37
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,820
It got very doomy.

38
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,920
It really did.

39
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,260
All right, give me a sec.

40
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,700
So today, for those who are wondering why I am live on a
Sunday, because it is my...

41
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,560
Okay.

42
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,760
All right, I just thought, okay, I gotta do an important DM
real quick, guys.

43
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,380
I gotta, sorry, I'm like, I gotta do it in...

44
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,980
I gotta do an important message real quick, work message
real quick.

45
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,560
Everybody, everybody isn't even here.

46
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,720
Like, okay, as long as I'm not the last person in the VC, it
should...

47
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,980
Oh, it's because the matches are...

48
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,220
Sorry.

49
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,360
Okay, I forgot.

50
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,140
Let me double check.

51
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,720
Yeah, sorry.

52
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,060
I'm all over the place right now.

53
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,000
Sunday is my off day, so...

54
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,300
Sunday is my off day, so, like, my brain is like, why are
you alive right now?

55
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,240
Why are you working?

56
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,000
You're supposed to be still sleeping, and I'm catching up to
your sleep debt.

57
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,360
But anyway, I was invited to do the show...

58
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:19,200
show match uh for the j3 community clash tournament um
before the before their finals um and uh it's gonna be for

59
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:27,380
three matches we have to have a deadpool in our game which
that would mean that is flats um so my team will be flats

60
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:45,680
craiggy day malaya lulu and me and we are against booger fan
fan rain Kingsman and Moxie and what's crazy is that J3

61
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:59,320
purposely included three supports on each team so no matter
what we're gonna be playing with three supports we're gonna

62
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:09,100
be playing triple support against triple support that mad
man that absolute mad man

63
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:25,220
he really did that to us he really got to be playing triple
support the entire three games because all three it's not

64
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,980
like all three of us the three supports on each team does
not really flex

65
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,100
um right she thank you for those ray thank you thank you I
hope you have, uh, I hope you have a great stream.

66
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,660
Uh, this is gonna be so fun.

67
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,840
Um, anyway, uh, making a true support theme.

68
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,340
So it's gonna be one, two, three for the, it's like one
tank, two DPS, three supports.

69
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,600
Anyway, ah, where was that?

70
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, I got to shoot an important DM real quick.

71
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,740
Let me finish this DM super quick.

72
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,860
Uh, I can't even read out the DM while I'm typing.

73
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,500
I can't even read out what I'm typing, too, because I can't
spoil it.

74
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,760
It's something very important behind the scenes work.

75
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:29,180
I was going to do this when I woke up, and I didn't realize
I was going to wake up around 1 to 2 p.m.

76
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:38,160
I thought I was going to wake up earlier, but my body was
like, you got to catch up on that sleep debt because you are

77
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,100
so fucked up right now, and I'm like, You're so right.

78
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,680
You're so right, but good.

79
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,280
And then my body's like, it's a good thing.

80
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,540
Sunday's your off day.

81
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,040
And my body did not get the memo that Sunday, unfortunately,
was not my off day today.

82
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,440
My mind knew it.

83
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,300
My body not so much.

84
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,960
My body was just like, oh, good thing.

85
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,200
Today's your off day.

86
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,340
You can sleep as much as you want.

87
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,560
Sadly, that, sadly, that is not true.

88
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,700
All right, here we go.

89
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,400
Let's see it.

90
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,610
All right.

91
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,010
I shot my... I shot the DM.

92
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,430
Let's hope that...

93
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,870
Let's see.

94
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,410
All right.

95
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,690
I sent my message.

96
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,280
Let's hope that...

97
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,580
They saw my DM.

98
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,720
Can't say what it is.

99
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,500
I had to do a work message real quick.

100
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,280
Oh my god, that thing got...

101
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,900
I like clicked something.

102
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,200
I was like, oh my god, it was my...

103
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,680
It was my Chrome on.

104
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,380
Like, it was my Chrome on.

105
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,780
Oh my... Sorry, I'm a mess right now.

106
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,820
I really have...

107
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,480
I'm a fucking mess at the moment.

108
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,580
All right.

109
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,060
What else?

110
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,420
What else?

111
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:38,800
What else?

112
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,040
What else did I want to say?

113
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,100
Oh, yes.

114
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:43,940
Anniversary.

115
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,880
Anniversary.

116
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:54,460
I will reveal the special anniversary trailer after the show
match.

117
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,540
I will type the tweet live on stream.

118
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,440
And we can all react to it together after the show match,
guys.

119
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,420
Yeah.

120
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,100
Okay, let me shoot my...

121
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,520
Man, I'll join a message real quick.

122
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,760
Yeah, it'll be after the show match, so you gotta...

123
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,520
You gotta stay to the end.

124
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,480
And my brain is very slow.

125
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,800
My brain is very slow today.

126
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,580
It really is.

127
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,600

128
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,160
I'm not ready to work.

129
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm not ready to work at all.

130
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,680
Like, I'm not ready.

131
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,160
I don't think I'll ever be ready.

132
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,380

forky dog no it can't be a forky dog because or is it tyke

Cartman and rivals and he's like a penny one trick so I'm

favorite to win the entire championship because like their

163
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,730
team was so fucking good but i guess they just don't know
how to deal with mr fantastic

164
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:11,670
knocked out Terra's team during like um the the top eight
bracket but like to be fair when pro players fight against

165
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:22,490
like the same meta over and over again and then there's some
random mr fantastic like yeah like mr fantastic and and it's

166
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:30,230
working you're like what the fuck do I do I've never fucking
prepped for this I'm never fucking prepped for mr fantastic

167
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:41,250
like yeah nobody like one of the games they they literally
won one of the maps they won one of the maps because pizza

168
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,050
was on mr.

169
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,970
fantastic and they're like i can't believe we can't deal
with one mr.

170
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:53,190
fantastic like i remember i was watching the the i just
pulled up the stream because like someone um my team was

171
00:17:53,190 --> 00:18:00,270
like when uh someone i don't remember like i think like
someone someone was messaging me being like Oh my god.

172
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,390
Oh my god.

173
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:02,810
Wait.

174
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,470
Pizza's team is winning.

175
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,050
And then I pulled up one.

176
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,710
Like Tara.

177
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,430
I think it was.

178
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,410
I pulled up Tara's stream.

179
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,550
And then.

180
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,070
I don't remember which teammate.

181
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,410
But one of them was like.

182
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,270
How.

183
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,450
Why can't we kill one fantastic?

184
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,690
Like how are we losing to this fantastic?

185
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:23,450
Like.

186
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,810
It's.

187
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:34,590
It's just, it's just the fact that they did, I feel like
they just, they just didn't train for it, because they're

188
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,810
not used to playing against, against, like, weird-ass cops.

189
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,850
I mean, he is pretty fantastic.

190
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,050
He sure is.

191
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,640
He sure is.

192
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,120
Oh, my God.

193
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,420
All right, what do we do then?

194
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,180
I, I guess we queue up.

195
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Oh, man, but I don't want to.

196
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:12,760

206
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,190
Quarantine zone?

207
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,370
That's too much thinking right now.

208
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,510
I just want to react.

209
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,590
My brain is not awake right now.

210
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,610
My eyes are so fucking heavy.

211
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,210
You know what?

212
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,430
To fit how I feel right.

213
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,190
This is how I actually feel right now.

214
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,010
Oh my god, I haven't seen this map in 80 years.

215
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,810
React?

216
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,610
The thing is, I didn't prep my stream to pull up my Chrome.

217
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,390
So I'll pull out my browser and I always never trust myself
if I don't prep beforehand.

218
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,530
Like, I'm just scared of accidentally doxing myself.

219
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,810
Or, like, leaking anything.

220
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,390
Because I don't trust myself.

221
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,690
I'm incompetent.

222
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,230
And I know it.

223
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,150
Bro, how long has this guy been beating me up?

224
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,730
Oh, goodbye.

225
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,050
Where's my support?

226
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,130
I am not aiming right now.

227
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,550
I should really start aiming.

228
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,490
Whoa!

229
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:49,890
Whoa!

230
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,250
I did not expect him to show up.

231
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,850
Alright, here we go.

232
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,230
Let's go.

233
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,950
Let's play again.

234
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,410
I need, I should do full speed.

235
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:22,530
screen mode i should never doesn't mean i will i think we're
losing so much what the how is he allowed to just shoot me

236
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,450
from behind

237
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,120
i don't like that i don't like that he's just allowed to do
that

238
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:46,510

They're coming with me!

241
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,550
No matter what!

242
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,230
That's why you're not hiding from me too!

243
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,410
I see you!

244
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,290
I'm dead.

245
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,650
There you go.

246
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,450
I see you.

247
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,810
Alright, I got three guys.

248
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,390
In one all I became the ace.

249
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,070
I got mine.

250
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,750
All it took was one and I became the best player in the
world.

251
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,490
Or in this lobby.

252
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,170
Look at that.

253
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,660
That's all it took.

254
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,820
I assumed that...

255
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,280
There we go.

256
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,020
It's fine.

257
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,520
I got him out of Hulk form.

258
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,720
That's not fair!

259
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,320
Amma ulted and got ace now!

260
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,060
It's alright.

261
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,940
Second best.

262
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:01,940
SVP.

263
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,760
Doesn't hurt to be SVP.

264
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,740
There we go.

265
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,260
Let's go.

266
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:19,360
my eyes my eyes are so tired thank god i'm on support the
easiest role in game

267
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:37,090
until i get dope until until in a in a supports not the
easiest role in in an eu apparently apparently only in an a

268
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,670
is it's the easiest role i will say that like

269
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,470
The moment I get dope, it's over.

270
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,490
It's over.

271
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,270
Yeah.

272
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,190
No, no, trust me.

273
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,690
I'm not aiming right now.

274
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,290
I'm actually so tired.

275
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,450
My aim is actually a lot better.

276
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,510
A lot better when I'm actually awake.

277
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,470
When I'm actually awake.

278
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,670
It's, I see you.

279
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,250
This must be all how the hell it feels whenever I fucking...

280
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,570
Okay, apparently I don't see him.

281
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,490
This is my lazy...

282
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,710
Like, I would have killed... I would have hit that.

283
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,250
Literally my first game of the day.

284
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,030
No warm-up.

285
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,670
Please don't kill me.

286
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,320
Oh...

287
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:59,050
it's okay we chill I think I believe in my team all right

like I should help her no oh shit get my cloak Don't get me!

289
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,150
Please, aim for the club, not me!

290
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,390
Alright, there we go.

291
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,460
Alright, I think I might need coffee.

292
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,420
Alright.

293
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,560
We got this.

294
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,980
Alright, here we go.

295
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,580
Let's go.

296
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,300
Also realize I'm not on full screen right now.

297
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,040
If I was on full screen, maybe it'll be better.

298
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,760
I'm no, I say as I cope.

299
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,940
Maybe if I was on full screen.

300
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,880
Let's do it.

301
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,960
Warm up, warm up.

302
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,560
First game of the day.

303
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,640
But I feel like...

304
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,660
Alright, that's good.

305
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,480
I was a little worried.

306
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,580
Wait.

307
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,800
Is it raw input?

308
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,280
No, okay.

309
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,740
I cannot do raw input.

310
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:34,100
I know everybody uses raw input, but my muscle memory is so
trained without using raw input that, like, I just...

311
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm too lazy to go...

312
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,400
To retrain it.

313
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,960
I'm too lazy.

314
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,820
I know I shouldn't, but...

315
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,280
There's no way they know, right?

316
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,900
Like, get me out of here.

317
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,160
Alright.

318
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,560
I was like, there's no way they see me, right?

319
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,380
Stop healing!

320
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,940
I'm leaving this.

321
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:07,180
I assume that maybe if I shoot in this general direction,
that somebody will be in there.

322
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,100
How did he die?

323
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,180
Oh, I got you, Ultron!

324
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,100
Remember what I'm doing for you!

325
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,560
You're welcome, I'm a hero.

326
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,540
What the fuck?

327
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,440
What the fuck is that?

328
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,360
Really?

329
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,380
He lives?

330
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,560
I wish I had healers like that.

331
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Oh!

332
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,740
I might like get knocked out soon.

333
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,260
That's right!

334
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,080
That was like the most... I forgot about this thing.

335
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,140
I...

336
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,340
It's okay.

337
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,180
I got my one.

338
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,940
I got my one.

339
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,360
I forgot that that exists.

340
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,740
Oh, double stun.

341
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,040
That's awkward.

342
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,620
Alright.

343
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,860
Look, I did my job.

344
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,880
I got one guy.

345
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,760
Like, that should be, like, enough.

346
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,660
Oh, goodbye.

347
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,080
It's quick play.

348
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,620
I needed to warm up.

349
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,160
I'm so tired right now.

350
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,960
My aim is, like, super lazy.

351
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,700
I shall claim my victory.

352
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,680
Yeah, apparently, okay, J3 was like, there's only 10 minutes
left of this game.

353
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,020
Remember to get there in time because he didn't sink.

354
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,200
He thought Flats was going to 3-0.

355
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,060
And then the other team got a point in the last game.

356
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,980
So now, so we're, we got wait.

357
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,240
They might actually reverse, they could reverse sweep it.

358
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,340
Hey, missed though.

359
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,780
God, that fucking strafe is pretty neat.

360
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,760
This strafe is pretty good, I will admit.

361
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,060
Oh, whatever.

362
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,180
I'll stand here.

363
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,560
Yeah, I almost got her.

364
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,920
That was a pretty neat strafe that she had.

365
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:24,810
I know.

366
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,010
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

367
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:26,290
Thank you.

368
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:26,810
Thank you.

369
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,590
That's it.

370
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,270
It's time.

371
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,390
It's Call of Duty time.

372
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:31,890
Oh, wait.

373
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,250
That's not Sorry, I, like, whatever.

374
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,030
SILOC chat.

375
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,490
Wait, were they?

376
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,290
Yeah, it's fine.

377
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,390
There's no way I'll get fucked up, right?

378
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:41,930
It's alright.

379
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,010
I'm thinking about Twitch Prime.

380
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,030
Thank you, thank you.

381
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,110
Oh, they won?

382
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,210
Oh, shit.

383
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:48,570
Okay.

384
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,010
That was fast.

385
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,170
I thought we were going to have another 30-minute game.

386
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:55,790
Alright.

387
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,050
Don't worry, I'm almost done.

388
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,490
I mean, should I just leave?

389
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,990
Do I just leave?

390
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,170
Like, I'm not going to start right away, right?

391
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,270
Oh, they're on domination.

392
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,570
Yep, and Moxie might win his first tournament.

393
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,610
His first Rival's tournament.

394
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,070
I believe.

395
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,480
I believe.

396
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,720
I honestly don't know that...

397
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,320
I'm going to peel.

398
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,720
Never mind.

399
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,340
I leave.

400
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,320
I no longer want to peel.

401
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,660
I no longer want to help my team.

402
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,560
Boy, I actually forgot where the door is.

403
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,620
Wait, I could still help him.

404
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,390
Alright, it's fine.

405
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,770
We're fine.

406
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,170
I'm gonna go this way.

407
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,690
Oh, really?

408
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,870
That's fine.

409
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,370
I'll try and think.

410
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,510
Maybe they're here.

411
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,770
I will attempt to predict where they are.

412
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,930
Oh my god, this is so illegal.

413
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,930
It's like they're pocketing each other or something.

414
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,850
I know their game just finished up.

415
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,650
I'm just... I'm on domination too, so it'll be fast.

416
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,410
No, I haven't seen this map in 80 years.

417
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,230
So I'm like, where is everything?

418
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,350
That's it!

419
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,970
That's right!

420
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,290
Fuck that hook!

421
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,170
Oh, never mind.

422
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,390
I didn't realize the hawk can jump away.

423
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,870
That's crazy.

424
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,570
What the fuck?

425
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,550
Their support's got like the pocket of their lifetime.

426
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,090
At least I'm so tired.

427
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,990
Don't think that's it!

428
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:01,970
I'm going Punisher.

429
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,710
That's fucking... Oh fuck.

430
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,150
Okay, we're gonna fight this.

431
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,590
Never mind.

432
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,830
I was like, that's it.

433
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,830
I really want a shotgun to these guys.

434
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,520
Oh my god.

435
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,640
It must be nice to get pocketed.

436
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Oh, hey, I got a pocket.

437
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,070
He has a lot.

438
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,270
I'm just going to damage for him real quick.

439
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,890
As long as none of us cap the point, we're on our pathway to
finishing this game.

440
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,310
There we go.

441
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,360
We're not going to win, but let it...

442
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,830
Oh my god, they're actually patty-kicking each other!

443
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,690
What am I looking at?

444
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,790
I thought it was a quick game!

445
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,910
They're actually patty-kicking in quick play!

446
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,430
Oh my god, that's crazy!

447
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,430
They did a patty-kicking quick play!

448
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,670
They need this win.

449
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,510
I was not expecting what?

450
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,590
Alright, that's unfortunate.

451
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,350
It's fine.

452
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,750
That makes the game quick.

453
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,870
I legitimately was not expecting patty-kaking quickly.

454
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,570
Bucky, please!

455
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,410
I needed your help because they're patty-kaking!

456
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,310
I need one more DPS to shoot her!

457
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:43,870
I can't deal!

458
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,410
I can't kill them!

459
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,110
Thanks!

460
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,610
Punch you!

461
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,550
They're patty kicking.

462
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:55,010
I need one more DPS to shoot him.

463
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,890
He's learning.

464
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,910
At least it's over.

465
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,530
I can go to my game.

466
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,470
Oh, good.

467
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,330
But yeah, I didn't want to win anyway.

468
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,810
Bro, how the fuck?

469
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,670
I was not expecting Ace with that gameplay.

470
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,270
I was not expecting Ace.

471
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,070
I really...

472
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:24,110
It means they're like fucking covering each other like two
supports are just pocketing
