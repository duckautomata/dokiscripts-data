00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:52,510

2
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,250
okay, 12, 11.7.

3
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,690
All right, hello, everyone.

4
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,230
Hello, hello.

5
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,530
Today, we're going to, we're going back to Sleeping Dogs today.

6
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,930
But before I do, okay, wait, I want to listen to that.

7
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,330
Bram, over and over again while, over and over again while we're talking.

8
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:21,670
But, uh, did you guys see the new Mega Evolution for, uh, Pikachu 2.0?

9
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,390
No, Doki, it's for right...

10
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,690
No, no, you know...

11
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,850
You can see how badly they wanted to actually make a Pikachu mega evolution.

12
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,670
But because I assume like all mega evolution has to be like the final form of the Pokemon.

13
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,150
So...

14
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,150
So they're like, okay, we'll have to make right shoe.

15
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,510
But we'll make them look as close as possible to Pikachu.

16
00:06:55,250 --> 00:08:13,510
yeah they literally just just turned rachu into pikachu two point and it's i'm sorry but it's just it's so weird it just looks so fucking weird okay for those who didn't see it's like legally distinct pikachu i'm like just make pikachu make it break the rule make pikachu like the exception like at that point don't force this on a rachu i it could have looked um know it just and then they make them x and y but like i will like i don't know it's like okay i understand because like they did that for like you know the mu2 and charizard but like charizard x and y was so it's so subtle like the the design elements to make charizard to represent x and y is so fucking subtle like because like it's like all the flames are crossed so it's like an x and then the y comes from the charizard y's wings because it's shaped like a y um but then like Pikachu is like we're gonna tell sorry right to mega evil look okay I'm gonna show you guys I need to give you guys a visual before I I know it's much more

17
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:32,630
subtle I I didn't even realize was meant to represent, like, I didn't even realize Charizard Mega Evolution were meant to represent X and Y until I saw, literally the day I saw Pikachu X, Mega Evolution, sorry, literally the day I saw Ritue Mega Evolution,

18
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:42,150
I was like, oh, wait, Charizard was supposed to be X and Y, so that's when I realized, that's how long it took me to realize that.

19
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:51,590
So it was very subtle to me, but then, like, No, this is like, actually, like, like, they, they, they, like, smash it to your face.

20
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,810
Like, do you get it, guys?

21
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,190
Do you understand?

22
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,590
Look, Ritual is an X.

23
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,310
Look!

24
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:09,430
So, so this is, this is Ritual Mega Evolution X and Y.

25
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,650
And, okay, so my gripes about, do you understand it, kids?

26
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:35,050
But like, because like, it's, on Charizard, it's much more subtle, but like, on Ritu, it's really like, okay, we're gonna put, like, I don't know, we're just gonna stick two of his ears on, like, two of his tails onto his ears, and then, and that would look like an X.

27
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,970
And then, for Y, what if Ritu has two tails?

28
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:41,830
Whoa!

29
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,150
Oh, wait, no, that's X.

30
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,330
Sorry, but for X, what if Ritu has two tails?

31
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,730
Whoa!

32
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,570
Oh my god!

33
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,310
Awesome!

34
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,490
But like, like, I don't know.

35
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:08,290
It's just, they literally, it's like Pikachu trying to cosplay of Ezraichu, but he bought the cosplay at, at five and below or some shit at the dollar store at Dollarama.

36
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,770
And it's just so yellow.

37
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,450
It's so, it's just, it's just so weird.

38
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:23,890
like, I look at Ritue X and I think it's Pikachu, not Ritue.

39
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:29,650
I just, I just, I just think it's just, it's Pikachu with bigger ears.

40
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,030
Um, yeah, Pikachu from Timo.

41
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:44,430
I, uh, oh yeah, no, I saw the, I also saw the Mega Evolution for, um, Green Ninja, Del Fox and the other one.

42
00:10:44,550 --> 00:11:22,190
Uh, we all, know grass pokemon do not have any of our respect um but uh uh but it's just i don't know i think the oh and also the what's the other one the megalomar or whatever uh the water poke the water squid lady also got a megalitian and they're like guys look she's shaped like an m we're learning our I feel like it's like Sesame Pokemon Sesame Street right now.

43
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,870
It's like, hey everybody, do you know the leather M?

44
00:11:32,630 --> 00:12:45,890
But no, I just thought it was it was a bit disappointing to see the mega evolutions for for Pikachu 2.0 because I feel like but like the artwork of them looks really good like the two artwork actually looks okay like it it salvages whatever the fuck the 3d is but the the okay wait 2d 2d mega evolution but like the 3d screenshots are i don't know the 3d renders just there's just something it just looks so off i think it's the colors the 3d render of the cut the 3d render of the colors for right shoe mega evolution is just so off uh 2d mega evolution right i almost say pikachu again i i can't help it it just it just looks like pikachu like i there's no i cannot defend this it's just it's just pikachu how do i defend this like but this is what the this is what the 2D artwork.

45
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,470
The 2D artwork looks fine.

46
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,870
It actually like salvages it a little bit because like I think it's the yellow.

47
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:03,130
The yellow is just too bright on the 3D render and then I guess I don't have to look at as fucking stupid as whatever the fuck the ears are on the other one too.

48
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,510
I'm sorry but like also like what the fuck is that?

49
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:17,170
Like what like what is okay Like, what the fuck is wrong with his ears?

50
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,030
Like, does he just have four ears?

51
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,310
Like, what is that?

52
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,910
I don't understand.

53
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,130
Are they just another pair of ears?

54
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,470
Like, what is this?

55
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,310
What is this?

56
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,850
I need to know.

57
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,550
What the fuck is this part?

58
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,870
Is it hair?

59
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,930
Or are they like...

60
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,690
Is it hair?

61
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,490
Is it like an appendage?

62
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,030
Is it just...

63
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,190
Is it made of skin?

64
00:13:45,810 --> 00:14:16,450
horns what the fuck is that but anyway that's i just really wanted to show you guys uh why does he have pikachu's face wait what does right shoe look like right shoe 3d render also i just noticed that's literally just pikachu's face i just noticed that okay right shoe right shoe pokemon x where's this 3d render it just gives me 2d It just gets in 2D.

65
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,770
What does he look like in 3D?

66
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,670
I need to know.

67
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,350
Because like 3D and 2D just looks really...

68
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,150
It just...

69
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,590
Yeah, no, he does.

70
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,510
Wait, that's literally Pikachu's face.

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,210
That doesn't even...

72
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,950
That's not even right to his face.

73
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,670
Like, they barely even changed the model.

74
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,510

Oh, is it paid?

86
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,010
Oh, it's technically, oh yeah, it's technically paywalled because you have to pay for online services.

87
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,390

When you can just give that to Eevee?

93

Not even a hundred.

96
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,410
That's, like, way too much.

97
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,670
500 players in pokemon they're true

98
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:50,850
but that's really the only thing i really want to say today um also another thing i have a problem and i've relapsed into uh a rank addiction on marble rivals again um it is a problem because yesterday i was like i'm going to be productive right after i feel right after my silk song stream and then I then I proceed to spend um I think like six hours on I think no no that's too much okay at four hours I would say four I started at like what seven p.m.

99
00:17:51,070 --> 00:18:17,230
eight nine ten eleven twelve oh no never mind maybe it was never mind six hours it was I was like no that's too much and that counted in my head I was like what time did I stop play and I stopped to play stop playing rivals I was might be an accurate estimate to how much.

100
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:25,590
So I've accidentally relapsed into my rivals, not just rivals, sorry, I rank addiction again.

101
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,470
So today I'm going to try and be productive and not maybe play like one or two games of my rivals and that's it.

102
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,310
That's it.

103
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,630
So it is very unfortunate and my condolences to myself.

104
00:18:41,590 --> 00:19:38,710
it's bad because i'm actually sort of a little behind work right now um so today i am going to lock in on my backlog and to-do list today uh and maybe just play one or two games maybe just one or two games uh anyway today we're gonna play sleeping dogs i don't know how long i'm gonna play today um i do want to still keep short streams just because like i said i'm trying to um make sure this week to this week is basically like voice recovery week so um that's why i haven't been um streaming a lot a lot of doing long streams this week um so i might just do like two to three hours today and then next week we'll be back to regular hours um anyway let's go play sleeping dogs maybe one more game 12 matches in zekro thank you for the super chat thank you thank you Sing in the Super Chat.

00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,930
Wait, that's fine.

142
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,510
Please, I'm one of you guys!

143
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,710
Look, I have a police car!

144
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,990
Okay, I may have rammed the wrong thing.

145
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,330
Oh, shit!

146
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,370
Arran!

147
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,350
Okay, nice.

148
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,370
Oh, wait, now I'm closer to...

149
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,510
Okay, give me a sec.

150
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,470
I'm trying to remember the controls, guys.

151
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,810
Oh, wait, no, not my cop car.

152
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,330
All right, so...

153
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,590
All right, this is reverse.

154
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,930
Wait, what happened?

155
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,650
Oh, no, the cop didn't see it.

156
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,330
That's good.

157
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,290
All right, I gotta go back to ramming.

158
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,850
I hope I think...

159
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,430
Is this still...

160
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,390
Is this still around?

161
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,510
I think I lost it.

162
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,010
So...

163
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,890
Don't worry, I'm here to stop the criminal.

164
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,550
Don't worry, I'm here.

165
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,650
Wait, where's the drug bust?

166
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:17,430
Oh.

167
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,170
Oh, I lost a drug mission.

168
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,610
What happened to it?

169
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,370
It just disappeared.

170
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,050
What happened to the drug mission?

171
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,230
I don't understand.

172
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,930
What did I do wrong?

173
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:32,610
Wait.

174
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,270
I don't understand.

175
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,030
How could I lose my cop mission?

176
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,650
I thought I was being a really good cop.

177
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,210
Like...

178
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,050
What could...

179
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,390
What did I do to lose my job?

180
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,070
I don't understand.

181
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,010
What did I do right?

182
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,370
I can't believe it.

183
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,170
Alright.

184
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,730
That's it.

185
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:10,510
Oh.

186
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,230
Who's he talking to?

187
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,710
Hello, man.

188
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,430
It's the chairman.

189
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,530
Dahl.

190
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,050
Dahlia?

191
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,310
I like how they say they didn't translate Dahlia, but that means just big boss.

192
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,550
That's literally what it meant, but they didn't even translate that.

193
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,990
The rest of you, wait here.

194
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,190
Don't do anything until you hear from me.

195
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,470
What's going on?

196
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:42,390
You are staying here like I told you, and you are shutting the fuck up.

197
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,610
Got it?

198
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,610

202
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:24,730

203
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,910

00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:40,530
Oh, you should just be like should actually be a business owner If he's able to fucking run the night market.

207
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,690
What the fuck is he doing doing this?

208
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,610
He could literally just He can literally scam people legally.

209
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,090
Just be a...

210
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,450
Wasn't that blue-collar worker?

211
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,550
Conroy, they're good guys.

212
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,530
But they're not going to be leaders.

213
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:59,990
I know Conroy can earn more money by scamming regular people in a legal way.

214
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,270
Literally, he could be a CEO of a...

215
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,030
Look, I have to Peggy and my mom, too.

216
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,350
This can be a rough business.

217
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,630
But one thing we got going for us is each other.

218
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,690
Run it.

219
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,510
I know people use that.

220
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,850
of a Forbes company.

221
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,830
But it's not fun if it's legal.

222
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:32,270
I mean, technically, it's like, it's basically legal, but like, sort of illegal, but with 20 more steps.

223
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,750
He just needs to move his money on offshore bank accounts.

224
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,130
That's where he gets the balls to come after me.

225
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,570
He has a lot of power.

226
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,190
Along with drugs, he's in the process.

227
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,650
Institution for even sells women across the border into the rest of Asia.

228
00:27:50,130 --> 00:28:03,590
Holy shit like an industry Very sleazy But big money Winston we can't just walk in there not if it's it's technically legal If any if the CEO of a big company is not arrested.

229
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,990
It's legal

230
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:16,330
I'd rather see it coming, you know, you should be okay But if I get my ass shot Do not do anything stupid.

231
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:16,890
You hear me?

232
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,570
Oh, we got this.

233
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,470
Fuck off, Johnny.

234
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,430
Hey, Winston.

235

238
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,670
You guys used to be tight as shit.

00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:34,990
Is he here?

240
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,810
Nah, he left a while ago.

241
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,510
Without a scratch.

242
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,410
Doesn't bode so well for the other parties involved.

243
00:28:43,890 --> 00:29:37,850

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,770
Uncle Poe, there's really no need.

00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,370
Don't argue with me.

248
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,630
Do you know Roland Ho?

249
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,650
He has a business collecting debts.

250
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,970
The other day, he told me that he could use some help.

251
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,190
It's quite lucrative, you know.

252
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,250
Tell him I sent you.

253
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,890
Winston won't mind in the slightest.

254
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,470
Will you?

255
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,230

Look, it's not my car.

278
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,860
I don't have to worry about the paint job.

279
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,080
Hey, Roland Ho?

280
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,360

I hear you and Winston have been making trouble with Dog Eyes.

285
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,960
Dog Eyes has been asking for trouble.

286
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,920
I remember when I was like you.

287
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,780

00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,060
Don't take on a boss in your own triad.

291
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,180
Unless you know for a fact someone else is gonna back you.

00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,160
And he realized that the SUV was not car chase friendly.

305
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,740
Jesus.

306
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,500
Like, like, mini, mini mutes or some shit?

307
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,660
Action movie bullets.

308
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,360
Each bullet is its own grenade.

309
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,720
It's fine.

310
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,160
Oh, wait.

311
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,520
I didn't kill them yet.

312
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,040
There we go.

313
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,700
Alright, almost there.

314
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:25,980
Nice.

315
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,680
Oh my god, there's more cars!

316
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,120
What the fuck?

317
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,580
How is this car still that?

318
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,330
Okay, it's not my fault.

319
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,490
There's another car beside that car.

320
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:50,630
Okay, this car has to be made of like the head...

321
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,410
This car must be made of tank materials.

322
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,690
Because what the fuck was that car built out of?

323
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:01,770
Okay.

324
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,330

329
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,910
My car's not doing so well.

330
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,950
My car's starting to smoke.

331
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,530

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,900

It was so complicated, guys.

342
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,100

No one will know if he accidentally tripped on top of this rooftop because this meeting was technically off the records.

353
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,120
And then I can be undercover forever.

507
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,260
Guys, it was a speedrun tech.

508
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,380

00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:06,580
no problem at all mrs chew no problem i could take her for a ride and then i could take peggy for my fifth girlfriend

520
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:43,800
that's right i'm ready to meet my fifth girlfriend oh my god thanks for driving me around wait and she's settled for Winston I still have to pick the color I want he won't believe how much work it is to get ready for a wedding we've been planning for eight months now and there's still so much to be done I'm sure it better be perfect isn't wouldn't she be suspicious she'll be like how the fuck did Winston afford all the oh wait but she's just like as long as I get my dream wedding no oh

521
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,900
my your life is why it'd be good you have to have Someone you can be soft with, too, eh?

522
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,080
It's very important.

523
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,940
If you're hard all the time, one day you'll forget how to be soft.

524
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,280
What the fuck, Adam?

525
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,420
What was that?

526
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:14,140
If you're hard all the time, you won't know what it's like to be soft.

527
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,660
Uh, she's a handful, but, you know, her bark is worse than her bite.

528
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,480
That I know.

529
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,020
How about her me, Clever?

530
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:49,740
hard go hard or go home she used to scare me but then one day i was having a problem unless okay but if it's but then go see a doctor if it gets too long and mrs chew gave him a big lecture in front of the whole gang i thought she might use that cleaver on him ever since then winston's been an absolute doll and even though she still yells a lot i know her if it lasts longer than then uh

531
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,180
I mean, you know, I used to have a thing for blondes, too, and that drove her crazy.

532
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,880
Not enough if I went out with a Chinese-American girl, but...

533
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,700
But a whitey!

534
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,260
Well, if it's good to know she was loyal to her people.

535
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,020
No, she's loyal to her prejudices more like...

536
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:06,780
Congratulations!

537
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,560

538
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,660

I'll get back in the car.

549
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,260
You can wait five seconds.

550
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,900
I waited for you at that shop for two hours.

551
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,140
Actually, no.

552
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,340
Longer two hours.

553
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:26,060
I waited in that bridal shop for like maybe five hours while you're trying out dresses.

554
00:57:26,560 --> 00:58:04,540
You can wait in the car for five seconds while I'm doing like some blessings or whatever a temple will impress me it's our wedding oh is there a jay oh wait there's a jay sad okay wait for 10 more seconds it's her special day it's not even her special day this is not even her wedding day so emergency shop is called somebody is stealing our wedding cake must be that asshole dog i stopped the robbery little boy excuse me no it was me my sister Growing up in old prosperity,

556
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,560
All right, we got to steal a wedding.

557
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,780
We got to steal back a wedding cake, apparently.

558
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,360

559
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:14,880

560
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:15,840
Yeah, for a while.

561
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,160
It's fine.

562
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,120
I'm a good driver.

563
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:20,920
I can make it.

564
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,340
Winston mentioned that she passed away.

565
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,660
How did it...

566
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,060
She's not even the wedding day.

567
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:27,520
Wedding cakes?

568
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,160
No, it's good to remember.

569
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,900
Our wedding cakes usually made, like, on the day.

Like a fucking, what do you call it?

575
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,570
The Formula One race car engine?

576
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,150
A NASCAR engine?

577
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,030
Why is it so fast?

578
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:53,470
Get out there and get him.

579
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,770
My car, my car.

580
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:57,530
Here, here, take the wheel.

581
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:59,150
Careful, don't hurt my cake.

582
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:00,170
Oh yeah.

583
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:04,210
Just regular things you do to get your cake back.

584
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,550
Never late to deliver.

585
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:16,790
If you, this is the whole, like, if you get your pizza cake under, if you get your cake over 30 minutes, you get it for free.

586
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,960
Oh my god, if I, maybe if I stop shimmying back and forth.

587
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,860
Oh, I'm supposed to climb up.

588
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:33,740
I didn't realize I was supposed to climb up, like, climb to the driver's seat.

589
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,340
I thought that's automatic.

590
01:00:37,020 --> 01:01:06,600
so thoughtful wait slow down i was just like what is what is he doing but then in the end it's what am i doing i truly thought that like um it was automatic you know where i just have to stay there and then he'll just climb up by himself the ai will take a hold of him but where's acting hero I'm just busting it down on top of the van

591
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:17,370
He's not pulling over you're a gangster do something get out there and get him.

592
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,870
Wait, how does he know wait?

593
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:23,730
So she she knows that Winston's Winston's a gangster.

594
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:24,890
I thought she was lying.

595
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:36,470
I thought he lied to her about it She says don't hurt my cake as we casually just ran over a lady there Alright, there you go.

596
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:37,670
I'm still heading over.

597
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,230
Oh my god, don't worry.

598
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:41,770
I got you.

599
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,140
Wait, that was a...

600
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,880
That was a woman in there.

601
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,440
I thought it was a gang member.

602
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,940
Wait, maybe she was delivering someone else's cake.

603
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,080
That seemed like a regular citizen.

604
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,980
That did not seem like a triad lady.

605
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,000
I think we...

606
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,660
No, we didn't come.

607
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,600
commit a crime.

608
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:13,140
No.

609
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,520
Winston said that they were stealing their cake, and I believe Winston.

610
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,220
Wow, that's great.

611
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,500
I'll take it right to him.

612
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,160
Uncapped.

613
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,840
Thank you for the welcome to tomato farm.

614
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:23,720

Thank you.

618
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,120
Alright.

619
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,480
I'll drive Peggy to the temple and start robbing.

620
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,940
I guess we'll rob the temple.

621
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,300
We're going to the temple, aren't we?

622
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,800
I knew you'd understand.

623
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:46,600
Yeah, but she was like, she was like dressed like a regular citizen.

624
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,520
Not anymore.

625
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,780
Well, you're wrong way.

626
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:49,540
You have family.

627
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,380
You have us.

628
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:50,760
Thanks.

629
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:51,560
Yeah!

630
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:57,460
I know Winston's work can be rough, but it makes us a family too.

631
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:01,380
I'm surprised she like willingly married into like a triad.

632
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:11,660
I guess like, you know, she just closed her eyes and just be like, just be like, ooh, new Louis Vuitton bag.

633
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,380
Thanks, but I'm not looking for anything serious right now.

634
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,660
I wouldn't want it to reflect poorly on you.

635
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:26,840
I feel like the amount of stress and paranoia you get from being a wife of a triad gang member.

636
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:37,980
Because usually, don't they, like, you just lie to their girlfriends and be like, no, the reason why I work late nights is because, like, I'm just working a regular 9-5 job at the company.

637
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,040
Okay.

638
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,680
Wait here.

639
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,480
I'll be right back.

640
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,620
Get a robe?

641
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,440
Oh, cool.

642
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:45,920
Nice.

643
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:52,720
We're gonna perform sacrilegious deeds right now.

644
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,600
Surely I'll go to heaven with this.

645
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,340
Last walk past the monks to pick up the orchid.

646
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,280
How would they know?

647
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:08,540
How?

648
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:14,740
How would they know with my arms filled with triad tattoos?

649
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,060
How would they know?

650
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,160
When it...

651
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,760
When energy flows among flowers, we are all everywhere.

652
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,760
How do you do, fellow monks?

653
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,500
It's so true.

654
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,460
I love flowers too.

655
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,160
One simple trick for cheaper weddings.

656
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:40,840
Fevery.

657
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:41,920
Thank you for the super chat.

658
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:42,320
Thank you.

659
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:42,960
Thank you.

660
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,560
You'll never know.

661
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,100
You don't belong here.

662
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,900
What is belonging, brother, when we're all part of the same cosmos?

663
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,380
So true, besties.

664
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,160
He's like, oh, you're so true.

665
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,140
So true.

666
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:03,450
What happens if I...

667
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:06,950
Oh, wait.

668
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:12,630
I can't believe he snitched on me!

669
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:15,790
It was...

670
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:16,430
I tripped.

671
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:21,430
I tripped and my hand accidentally knocked him on his face.

672
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,170
I can't believe it.

673
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:24,950
What a narc.

674
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,370
Fucking narc.

675
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:37,470
That wasn't very cool of you, brother.

676
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,780
Oh, wait, I already grabbed the guy.

677
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:47,980
I tripped.

678
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:48,780
Don't belong here.

679
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,460
What is belonging, brother, when we're all part of the same cosmos?

680
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:53,940
Okay.

681
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,300
I didn't even beat him up!

682
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:06,860
My foot got caught on a pebble, and then I fell down, and my hand just accidentally brushed his face.

683
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:07,880
Oh, shit, money.

684
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:08,180
Yay.

685
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,000
What's this?

686
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,060
How do I do this?

687
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,200
Oh, it's...

688
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:24,650
Oh, my God.

689
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:25,450
What's the code?

690
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,770
Oh, it's 14?

691
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:30,050
14?

692
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:31,830
Am I timed?

693
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:32,950
I'm not timed for this.

694
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,790
I just have to slowly turn it up.

695
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:39,150
Alright, nice.

696
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:40,150
Oh, it was 23.

697
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:41,710
Wait, what the fuck?

698
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:42,850
Why didn't it go across?

699
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:43,490
There we go.

700
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:43,930
Oh!

701
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:47,130
I had to hold it in for a while.

702
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,410
That's why.

703
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,390
Alright, nice.

704
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:56,370
I got...

705
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,030
I got knockoff clothes.

706
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,570
I'm new here.

707
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:02,030
I'm a new... I'm a new intern.

708
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:05,370
part of a single great organism that never dies.

709
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,170
It's like, good enough.

710
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,930
Good enough.

711
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,850
Foxbowl, thank you for the super chat.

712
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:15,810
Thank you, thank you.

713
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,110
Thanks for elapsing, making my days better.

714
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:20,150
I'm a little late, but my birthday was two days ago.

715
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,110
So can I get a happy birthday from my Kamiyoshi?

716
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,230
Of course you can.

717
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,030
Happy birthday to you.

718
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:26,910
Happy birthday to you.

719
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:29,390
Happy birthday, dear Foxbowl.

720
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,150
Happy birthday to you.

721
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:35,090
Nice.

722
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:40,490
Wait, fight your way.

723
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:41,170
Oh, shit.

724
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:43,090
Your shell is soccering me.

725
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,090
Oh, my God.

726
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:45,690
It's okay.

727
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:46,710
I can just run away.

728
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:48,690
I bravely ran away.

729
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:49,030
Oh, wait.

730
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:49,710
Look, there's a shrine.

731
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:50,430
Give me a sec.

732
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,550
Let me do this shrine real quick.

733
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:56,790
I think I...

734
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,310
Wait, what's that?

735
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:58,530
Oh, yeah.

736
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,130
I think I lost him, guys.

737
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:02,250
I just ran so fast.

738
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,710
Who would have thought?

739
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,290
These monks got hands!

740
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:11,350
Wow, the best...

741
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:15,010
The best defense I've ever seen, guys.

742
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,470
Wow.

743
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:28,010
The greatest defense I've ever seen from a bunch of monks.

744
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:31,510
I can't believe it!

745
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:36,310
How did he do it?

746
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,690
They ran on the right side.

747
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,230
We were not prepared for that.

748
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:44,430
They are monks, not guys.

749
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,290
Oh, wait.

750
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,570
Thank you so much.

751
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:47,770
How can I say no?

752
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,950
They learned to fight, not run.

753
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:51,730
Do you have any wisdoms closing the backs?

754
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:54,570
I don't think these robes are going to make the right impression.

755
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,630
What do you think about this?

756
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:57,390
Our plan foiled.

757
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,390
Who could have expected him to run to the right?

758
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:09,350
Oh, I almost, I almost pressed the round button in the drive.

759
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,890
Uh, Winston is not gonna like this.

760
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:15,410
He's gonna like it because this was free.

761
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:17,710
We basically gave him a cheaper wedding.

762
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:21,150
Anything for a bargain.

763
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,470
A good deal is a good deal.

764
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,040
Alright.

765
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:30,280
Oops.

766
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,340
No, my police car.

767
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:46,540
All right, as long as I don't damage life, uh, I don't damage property, it'll be fine.

768
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:54,690
The police didn't expect a U-turn!

769
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,510
That's right!

770
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:03,630
The newest tech in police chases U-turns!

771
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:31,590
wait oh no oh no oh no he expected the U-turn oh my god this this alleyway was so tight holy shit this has to be like our best the best police driver ever bro this guy should like change careers right now

772
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,200
No, stop!

773
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,760
Holy shit, he's still behind me!

774
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:49,160
He's not giving up!

775
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:51,740
But that's...

776
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,260
Oh my god, he expected a U-turn.

777
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:56,340
But does he expect a U-turn of a U-turn?

778
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,380
He did, guys.

779
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,780
He's still right behind me.

780
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:00,520
Formula!

781
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,120
Oh yeah, that's right.

782
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,000
And then backwards!

783
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:07,560
And then forwards!

784
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:41,620
right get double juke's get uno reversal of an uno reversal thank you way thank you that's right did he expect an O-turn he may have expected a U-turn but what about an O-turn Peggy I know I know women's intuition it's It's the same with Winston.

785
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,920
He talks tough, but underneath he's a very caring man.

786
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:45,840
That's why I love him.

787
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:46,320
Thanks.

788
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:51,340
Oh, that guy fucking murdered like 10 guys, like in a week.

789
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,780
But he's so caring.

790
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:53,540
No, you don't understand.

791
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,380
He didn't murder me.

792
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,940
I hate that argument, though.

793
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,880
You know how like people say friends are really toxic or bad people?

794
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,160
But they're like, yeah, but he's not toxic towards me.

795
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,680
And I'm just like, bro, that person.

796
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,040
Bro, that person.

No, there's a regular massage parlor in front of me.

800
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:24,010
I'm dripless now.

801
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:26,530
I spent so much money, too.

802
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:29,410
I'm going to return to Jace statue real quick.

803
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:33,730
No, I need, like, 300k or some shit.

804
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:39,690
To buy the police uniform.

805
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,730
So they'll never know I'm actually a cop.

806
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:51,370
the skies they'll be like wow there's no way he's a cop because why would he make it that obvious

807
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,690
yeah i'm hiding in plain sight

808
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:17,650
i found one of your statues tiger oh the tiger ever think about going back to the states i didn't work the first time why would it again the past goes with you wherever you go so you will confront the past rather than from it.

809
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,130
Damn straight.

810
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:25,670
I wonder is the past something we can defeat or is it something we simply come to terms with?

811
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,130
You just gotta move on.

812
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:29,210
What would you like to learn?

813
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:30,850
Alright I want to learn.

814
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:32,590
What is this?

815
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:33,890
Oh nice!

816
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:36,050
I can finally break someone's arm!

817
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,270
Okay how do I do it?

818
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:46,830
Crack one two and then oh my god I break it Oh, wait, no, I already messed it up.

819
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:47,590
All right.

820
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:51,410
All right, now that I broke your leg, it's time to break your arm, too.

821
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,650
Oh, oops.

822
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:52,870
Sorry.

823
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:56,650
Okay, now that I gave you a concussion, it's time to break your arm.

824
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:58,410
There we go.

825
01:14:59,010 --> 01:14:59,030
Oh!

826
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,490
You paid for this.

827
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:04,610
That's the worst part.

828
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,410
Now it's time for your left arm.

829
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:13,190
He paid to get his arm broken.

830
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:18,750
All right, now I broke your arms in four places.

831
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:19,790
You're welcome.

832
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:20,850
What an honor.

833
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:22,070
Again?

834
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,350
All right.

835
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:24,570
Okay, Seifu.

836
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,030
Again?

837
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:29,750
Okay.

838
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:34,710
When does this end?

839
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,970
When will it end?

840
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:42,550
Oh, I think it's bugged.

841
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:44,350
I'm pretty sure.

842
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,610
Oh, yeah, it's bugged.

843
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,390
The first hit doesn't register.

844
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,590
Oh, okay, I'll bring you into this, too.

845
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:52,870
That's why you're in.

846
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:54,630
Okay, you're not bugged.

847
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:56,010
The other guy was bugged.

848
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:57,170
That's right.

849
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,620
Oh, my God.

850
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,840
Okay, yeah, this is bugged.

851
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:04,840
I'll just do it to this guy.

852
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:10,690
Okay.

853
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:12,250
Oh, now it works.

854
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:12,950
Okay, nice.

855
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:14,350
There we go.

856
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,330
We did it.

857
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:18,610
Now it's your turn.

858
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:20,350
That's right.

859
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:20,570
Oops.

860
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,330
Now it's your turn.

861
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:24,970
Oh.

862
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:28,390
Gotta make some ramen real quick.

863
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:29,450
Let me break the noodles.

864
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:30,950
Yeah.

865
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:34,070
He's like, please.

866
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:34,930
Not again.

867
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:35,530
Please.

868
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:41,470
Oh, man.

869
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:43,910
The arm crunch, too, afterwards.

870
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:45,730
It's crazy.

871
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:47,670
He's like, wait, wait, wait, wait.

872
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:51,930
It's like, not me!

873
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:52,510
Yeah?

874
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:52,990
What?

875
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:57,030
Holy shit!

876
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:01,750
Oh my god, now he's shouting soccering right now.

877
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:05,530
Like slapping, yeah, snap a glow stick real quick.

878
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:10,050
I'm making spaghetti.

879
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,200
Bro's got combos.

880
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,100
Nice.

881
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,160
I gained arm break.

882
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,960
learn how to break an arm.

883
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,180
We break the pasta.

884
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,420
I never break it, broke pasta.

885
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:32,020
I don't know, I just, I don't like, I don't like short noodles.

886
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,000
It's just, it's just weird, you know?

887
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,620
For me, it's just, it's just the taste.

888
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:43,000
I know it doesn't change the taste, but like, eating like, shorter noodles just, it's just so fucking weird.

889
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,720
It just, the texture is wrong.

890
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,800
Where am I supposed, where's my next mission?

891
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,820
Oh, Wait, it's just Water Street?

892
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,840
Wait, my only mission is Water Street.

893
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,660
Why is there another tempo?

894
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,140
Sheldon Showdown?

895
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,300
Oh my god!

896
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,420
Wait, I gotta go.

897
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,380
I'm gonna break some monks' arms.

898
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:19,660
Because, like, you're so used to the longer noodle, so when you start snurping and then, like, it's, like, stopping at 50%.

899
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:25,580
It's so unsatisfying Now that I learned how to break arms it's time.

900
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,780
There's no way they recognize me, right?

901
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:38,680
There's no way they recognize me as the guy that stole from them I know I would like to enter your I like to enter your tournament

902
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:57,540
Oh, shit Oops, I fucked up That's right Oh my god, that's right got your name Oh, shit.

903
01:18:58,740 --> 01:18:58,940
Okay.

904
01:18:59,400 --> 01:18:59,880
Oh, my God.

905
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:00,360
Wait.

906
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,500
These mugs are ungrabbable.

907
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:04,820
Oh, my God.

908
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:05,960
They're ungrabbable.

909
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,940
How do I grab something I can't grab?

910
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,460
That's crazy.

911
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:12,960
Okay, not.

912
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,500
Oh, my God.

913
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,500
They're actually ungrabbable.

914
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,100
They're so good.

915
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:19,220
Oh, my God.

916
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,060
Okay, I just do counters.

917
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:20,880
Just do counters.

918
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,920
I'm just going to counter.

919
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:24,980
There's no reason.

920
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,980
There's no reason to punch back.

921
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:29,720
That's right.

922
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,600
I'm playing defense now.

923
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,520
I'm going all on D.

924
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:40,710

Get out of here!

926
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,320
I can't believe it.

927
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,820
I learned all about breaking arms and I can't even use it.

928
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:53,520
Wait, is there more?

929
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,680
Oh shit, there's more.

930
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,640

Guys, I don't think it's a tournament anymore.

962
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,960
I think I'm actually doing an invasion.

963
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,680

It's the monk pit.

984
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:59,690
Yeah, I'm creating my own mosh pit, guys.

985
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,250
And they're like, sorry, Doki.

986
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:08,050
Doki, it was actually the tournament was supposed to be the temple from across the street.

987
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:14,280
You think I'm gonna go to heaven?

988
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:22,920
You think a temple will accept my spirit blessing?

989
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,680
Imagine if I got the wrong address.

990
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,600
Who the pile you go?

991
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,400
That's right.

992
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,580
Hostile down.

993
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,460
I like how we're calling them hostiles.

994
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:49,160
He was like, he came at me with his foot.

995
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,400
I had to defend myself, guys.

996
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:04,920
Their body parts are registered weapons.

997
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,620
Oh, dear.

998
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,040
This was all self-defense.

999
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,200
All 40 of these bodies.

1000
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,820
I was defending myself.

1001
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,960
up last one

1002
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:41,580
i think this is a little too much for some flowers but what do i know um it wasn't for flowers it was for a tournament wait i didn't even win guys i didn't win money guys i i'm starting to believe that was not a

1003
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,500
Where's my money reward?

1004
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,140
I got a quote.

1005
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:59,960
Yeah, I like raided the closet after I beat up 40 monks and be like, that's my reward for the day.

1006
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:10,250
I was like, guys, look, I got my trophy as I raided their closet.

1007
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,000
Let's see.

1008
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:16,360
Do I do this?

1009
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,000
People are saying this is a DLC mission.

1010
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,580
There's no other missions, though.

1011
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,780
Yeah, it's literally just Water Street.

1012
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,220
Like, go to Water Street now.

1013
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:33,090
That's right.

1014
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:36,210
I showed them how to do the real Kung Fu.

1015
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:40,940
Alright, we go this way.

1016
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,320
Oh, Water Street is not the SD.

1017
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,360
Okay, that's good to know.

1018
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:45,440
I got confused.

1019
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,540
Alright, we listened to this radio.

1020
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,060
I pee.

1021
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,000
I'll be right back.

1022
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:49,920
I'll just...

1023
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,100
Yeah, that's fine.

1024
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:52,020
I'll be right back.

1025
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:52,900
I need some bathroom.

1026
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:12,820
Okay, let me double check something real quick, guys.

1027
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:30,440
I'm not blocking traffic.

1028
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,200
Look, my car jams.

1029
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:33,340
It's not my fault.

1030
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:38,320
All right, let's go do the waterway.

1031
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,120
The waterway?

1032
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,280
Water street.

1033
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,280
Let's do water street now.

1034
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,200
I feel like not even at 50% of this.

1035
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,780
game for the story.

1036
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,080
Does anyone know, like, where?

1037
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:50,280
Am I even halfway?

1038
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:59,260
Because it's like, if this is like, it's like Hong Kong GTA, I assume the story is, like, really long.

1039
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:05,340
Classic curves never go out of style.

1040
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,060
Wait, is this a race?

1041
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,080
I don't want to do a race.

1042
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,820
Wait, do I have to race?

1043
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:15,280
Oh, I'm at 40%?

1044
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,180
Oh, I didn't even realize I did that much progress.

1045
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:25,190
Get away!

1046
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:33,300
She was in the way, guys!

1047
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:34,760
She was...

1048
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,660
I have the right away, chat.

1049
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:38,140
I...

1050
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,300
Oh, wait.

1051
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,580
There's a speed race there.

1052
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:42,420
Oh, shit.

1053
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:42,820
Okay.

1054
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,600
I have property damage for this.

1055
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,240
We're in a race and we care about property?

1056
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,920
Look, why she's standing in the middle of the road it's not my fault

1057
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:07,100
that was her own fault for standing in the middle of the road i was just trying to drive this is a race it's all about winning or losing

1058
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:23,220
no i drove straight guys she walked into my path you all saw that She walked into my road.

1059
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,900
I was driving straight.

1060
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:34,160
It was straight, guys.

1061
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,200
Yeah, I should win this race.

1062
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,900
Victory at all costs.

1063
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,480
Nice.

01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:51,700

1205
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,700
I don't even think I can look at him.

1206
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,460
I'm worried that I actually...

1207
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,380
YouTube's gonna...

1208
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:28,960
The YouTube AI is gonna...

1209
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:32,660
Like, take the stream down if I look at it for too long.

1210
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:33,980
I'm just...

1211
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:35,040
Whoa.

1212
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,320
Whoa.

1213
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:39,680
Whoa.

1214
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:41,600
There you go.

1215
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:44,520
You do not look at it.

1216
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,300
I like how there's, like, screaming in the background.

1217
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,400
I'm just kidding.

1218
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:53,600

There we go.

1224
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,840

1225
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,620

1226
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:13,880

1227
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:16,020

1228
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,320
Ball shot.

1229
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,520

Solid, thank you.

1232
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:31,660
I made a severe laugh subjunct.

1233
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,400
It said a chandelier.

1234
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,060
I was like, whoa, what am I going to do with a chandelier?

1235
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,500
What's that?

1236
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:40,780
Peggy?

1237
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:41,900
Oh, God.

1238
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:42,660

01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:48,540
Out of here.

1242
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:52,700
She doesn't deserve this.

1243
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:53,740
Wait, is she alive?

1244
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,520

1245
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:57,100
It's okay.

1246
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,840
It's just a little blood loss.

1247
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:08,340
it's okay she's just she is just a little blood loss and she's fainted guys that's not her blood

1250
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:35,760
That's the craziest shit you can do when someone is aiming at you.

1251
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:38,660
Wait, but like, I gotta make sure.

1252
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:43,420
Man, these are... Man, did we not tip the catering staff?

1253
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:46,260
Alright.

1254
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:50,740
Now, we gotta double tap just in case they turn in the zombies, you know?

1255
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:53,140
I just don't want... I just gotta make sure!

1256
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,560
What if they turn in the zombies?

1257
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:02,290
I'm securing the kill.

1258
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:04,830
Call the rest of the boys!

1259
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:06,330
I need them here now!

1260
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:10,950
Holy shit, these catering staff's hardcore.

1261
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:14,830
Okay, this gun fucking sucks.

1262
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:15,750
Not gonna lie.

1263
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:18,930
I should have stayed with the pistol.

1264
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:24,050
Alright, nice.

1265
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:24,850
Hostile down.

1266
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,250
See, they're the bad guys.

1267
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:27,790
It says Hostile down.

1268
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:30,710
There you go.

1269
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:32,970
Ready?

1270
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:34,630
Alright, it's a black...

1271
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:36,490
Are the white shirts part of my team?

1272
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:38,150
Is it... Oh wait, they are.

1273
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:42,310
I was gonna say, is this black shirts versus white shirts?

1274
01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:45,210
It's like skins versus shirts.

1275
01:43:46,170 --> 01:43:47,630
We're in PE right now.

1276
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:52,820
Wait, who shot me?

1277
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,200
Oh my god, it's like all the...

1278
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:59,520
Oh, of course you peek your head the moment I look on the other side.

1279
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:04,010
There we go.

1280
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:06,210
I think that's it, right?

1281
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,110
No, there's still one more guy over there.

1282
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:12,680
There we go.

1283
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:13,660
Go to the stairs.

1284
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,860
Where the fuck's the stairs?

1285
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:16,860
Oh, this way.

1286
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:24,070
Okay, I still have a lot of bullets.

1287
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:24,750
Nice.

1288
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:27,830
Wait, what's this gun?

1289
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:28,990
Oh, it's just regular.

1290
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:31,590
Wait, where's the white shirt?

1291
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:32,670
Wait, are they all dead?

1292
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:34,390
Bro, what the fuck?

1293
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:36,310
Wait, oh my god, you guys...

1294
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:37,790
Why didn't you take cover?

1295
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:41,590
Clear all the...

1296
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:43,250
Where did we... Did we hire this kid?

1297
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:44,450
you step at Timu?

1298
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:52,690
at that, what was that app where you can hire handyman to do, like, you can hire people to do, like, random tasks for you?

1299
01:44:53,850 --> 01:44:55,190
I forgot what it's called.

1300
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:57,490
It's like, it's like Uber, but for people.

1301
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,300
No, not Fiverr.

1302
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:07,500
There's like an, there's like a, task rabbit.

1303
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:08,900
Yeah.

1304
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:12,300
I felt like, did we hire these guys from task rabbit?

1305
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:17,600
And then we're like, and we accidentally gave them, like, one star, so they brought out their guns.

1306
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:21,580
Oh.

1307
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:24,020
It's okay, he's a lot.

1308
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:25,360
Sorry, buddy.

1309
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,280
I just had to make sure there were zero witnesses, guys.

1310
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:35,300
Uncle Poe, are you okay?

1311
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:36,340
Can you walk?

1312
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,120
What's going on?

1313
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,280
What happened to Winston?

1314
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:41,820
Okay, come on.

1315
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,380
We gotta get you out of here.

1316
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:51,420
I like how Winston was like save Peggy and then way was like I gotta help the old man

1317
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:00,860

1318
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:13,460

1322
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:08,360
That's the risk I'm gonna take.

1323
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:14,940
Usually you're not supposed to run when someone's bleeding out because it'll, like, cause them to lose their blood faster.

1324
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,640

1328
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:33,000
Alright, here we go.

1329
01:47:34,900 --> 01:48:09,290

1330
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:11,670
I got you, Uncle Poe!

1331
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:16,130
My uncle, he's hurt.

1332
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:17,090
We need a doctor.

1333
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:17,570
Now!

1334
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:18,230
What is this?

1335
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:19,850
What's going on here?

1336
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:25,470
My boy, maybe you'll want to leave before our friends, the police.

1337
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:27,770
Yeah, I catarized his wounds, guys.

1338
01:48:27,950 --> 01:48:29,430
That's why my HP went up.

1339
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:34,170
And if anything happens to him, I'm holding you personally responsible.

1340
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:34,850
Oh, thank God.

1341
01:48:34,910 --> 01:48:35,430
I'll be clear.

1342
01:48:36,170 --> 01:48:36,970
Okay, okay.

1343
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:45,580
I did it!

1344
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,180
Look at that.

1345
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:48,360
I'm gaming.

1346
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:53,820
I was gonna say, how is my cop score higher than my try-ass score?

1347
01:48:54,820 --> 01:49:01,160
I feel like, if anything, I'm gonna fail to count.

1348
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:01,900
Okay, we need that.

1349
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,440
We're doing a lot of counterings.

1350
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:06,140
That's crazy.

1351
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:17,300
Okay.

1352
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:20,680
Where have you been?

1353
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:21,960
Stuck in traffic.

1354
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:23,700
It's Hong Kong.

1355
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,540
That's so true.

1356
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:25,800
Chiff took the MTR.

1357
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:26,760
Is it easy for me?

1358
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:28,580
I know you've been through a lot, boy.

1359
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,340
More than we have any right to ask.

1360
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:32,320
Now the wedding.

1361
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:34,200
It was a massacre, Raymond.

1362
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:35,120
A massacre.

1363
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:36,500
Winston was a red pole.

1364
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:36,800
Sure.

1365
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:40,080
But his wife, a fucking gun down his wife on her wedding day.

1366
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:42,400
We knew you would become personally attached to her.

1367
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:43,480
It's inevitable.

1368
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:44,800
Not a snitch guy.

1369
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:46,380
I don't work for the cops.

1370
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,720
How dare they say that?

1371
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:50,820
No, it's not.

1372
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:51,740
You're a cop.

1373
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:54,440
So which one of you guys is under cover?

1374
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,860
I'll pull you out right now.

1375
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:57,600
Pull me out.

1376
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:59,320
Your job was to get close to Winston.

1377
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:00,820
Now, that's not much of a strategy.

1378
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:02,180
Get close to you.

1379
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:03,460
Open your eyes, Raymond.

1380
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:04,700
I am Winston.

1381
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:05,640
That's true.

1382
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:06,100
I'm gone.

1383
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,300
I'll be taking his place.

1384
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:08,200
Because they both died.

1385
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:09,580
I report to him now.

1386
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:10,620
You want the red pulse?

1387
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:11,800
I'm one of them.

1388
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:13,600
That's what worries me, Wei.

1389
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:15,140
You're one of them.

1390
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:19,260
You want to give up the best undercover HK PD

1391
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,080
I'm the best they've ever had.

1392
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,280
I'm the best they've ever had, guys.

1393
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,160
They'll never know.

1394
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:38,580
Guys, I'm the best they've ever had.

1395
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:40,460
They've never caught me.

1396
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,380
They'll never catch me.

1397
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:47,260
Oh, more PTSD.

1398
01:50:54,620 --> 01:51:22,460

1403
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:35,500
Oh my god, I can't believe it's been two hours since I got my last massage.

1404
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:37,060
Hello.

1405
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,600
I would...

1406
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:43,300
Hello, I'm about to get my seven stamps for another free massage.

1407
01:52:43,620 --> 01:52:44,780
I'm almost there.

1408
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:47,800
I'm almost gonna complete my stamp rally, guys.

1409
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:51,500
I'm so stressed out.

1410
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:56,600
After that wedding, yeah, massage is very needed.

1411
01:52:58,820 --> 01:52:59,260
Nice.

1412
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:01,120
Alright, let's go.

1413
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,360
We gotta stay in peak conditions.

1414
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:06,200
That's right, we can't have it all bottled up inside, guys.

1415
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:07,880
We gotta be relaxed for this.

1416
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,180
Wait, what?

1417
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,380
There was a drug bust?

1418
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,580
I was not paying attention.

1419
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:20,200
Oh, shit.

1420
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:23,140
I drove away from a drug bust.

1421
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:23,920
I didn't even know.

1422
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,480
Are they still there doing the drugs?

1423
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:26,880
Oh, they're gone now.

1424
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:28,620
Oopsie.

1425
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:33,900
Oopsie.

1426
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:36,920
I guess they're gonna still keep doing whatever they were doing.

1427
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:39,660
Not anymore, I guess.

1428
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:44,630
Where is it?

1429
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:45,290
Hot shot lead.

1430
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:46,330
Okay, it's this way.

1431
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:50,290
Look I was busy, okay?

1432
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:54,930
How do I reverse?

1433
01:53:56,910 --> 01:53:58,550
I was busy!

1434
01:53:59,210 --> 01:54:12,650
I had a very important meeting at that massage parlor This is where I conduct most of my business meetings All right, here you go

1435
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:35,360
Look they're they're police cones and I'm the police That's how I get that that is based they put those cones up to make sure that the police can use that part of the road See this is why you got wear helmets when you're on a motorcycle guys motorcycles are even more dangerous than driving a car and i'm gonna prove you why

1436
01:54:39,360 --> 01:55:04,100

I would wear my helmet from now on.

1438
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:09,280
What?

1439
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:13,460
Trace Ace's phone.

1440
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,520
Oh, I have to go to the center.

1441
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:18,820

1442
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:20,060
Oh, shit.

1443
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:20,900
That's cool.

1444
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:23,760
Where is the center, though?

1445
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:24,520
Like, here?

1446
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:29,460

1447
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:32,220
Guys, I'm trying to get to the center, guys.

1448
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:42,640

1452
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:14,220
Because it's taking me so long to trace this stupid-ass call.

1453
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:17,460
It might just be here.

1454
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,060
That has to be the center now.

1455
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,340
Is that not the- there we go.

1456
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,340

I looked everywhere, but top left.

1466
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:22,060
Okay, that's how fast her blood is flowing out.

1467
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,940
I didn't realize her help.

1468
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,180

What the fuck happened?

1472
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:43,220

01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,640

Where is she?

1481
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:10,860
Investigate the crash.

1482
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:11,520
Okay.

1483
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:14,640

01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:19,380
Oh my god, you're okay.

1485
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:29,090
Who's he?

1486
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:30,030
Ace?

1487
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:41,120
Oh my god.

1488
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:45,620
Were you wearing seatbelts?

1489
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:48,340
See, this is why you should wear seatbelts too, guys.

1490
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:49,540
This is her.

1491
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:51,560
She didn't wear seatbelts.

1492
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:52,740
You'll be alright.

1493
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:54,340
You think he's okay?

1494
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:58,400
He's fine, right?

1495
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:01,220
Yeah, I think he's fine.

1496
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:03,760
He's just hotboxing the car.

1497
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:07,120
Always wear your seatbelts, guys.

1498
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:11,320
Oh, photograph the car.

1499
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:13,820
Alright, don't worry.

1500
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:16,980
You might be dying, but I gotta take a photo.

1501
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:20,180
There we go.

1502
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:26,600
Calling Ting.

1503
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:28,560
Yes, Inspector.

1504
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:30,880
Hot shot kill days damn it way.

1505
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:32,160
We were supposed to catch them in the act.

1506
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:39,940
Yeah, well they acted too fast I have an eyewitness statement and all the evidence you need to get that you didn't call the ambulance or didn't just show up Don't bother.

1507
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:40,860
I have a better idea.

1508
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,480
I'll challenge him to a race and once we're in it.

1509
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:46,560
I'll lead him right to you all right But wait, I want him alive.

1510
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:51,870
Are they still there though see they're okay see?

1511
01:59:53,870 --> 01:59:55,110
What happens if I

1512
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:19,940
Wait He's gotta return to his people

1513
02:00:26,130 --> 02:00:49,440
Oh my god Oh my god I gotta go I gotta go I thought he'd float I thought he Oh my god is he still Is he still there See, it's the easiest to go.

1514
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:53,440
Guys, he returned to his people, guys.

1515
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:55,240
He returned to one story.

1516
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,420
I really need a man.

1517
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:58,500
He is.

1518
02:00:58,680 --> 02:00:59,740
He sure is floating.

1519
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:02,620
He's definitely floating now.

1520
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:05,140
Let's see who rules the street.

1521
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:07,300
Where are you hiding out?

1522
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:09,320
You come, we watch.

1523
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:11,460
Guys, look, nothing happened.

1524
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:12,980
There was no paramedic.

1525
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:13,340
See?

1526
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,200
There was no body.

1527
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,160
Guys.

1528
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:19,440
There was no body.

1529
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,840
Nothing happened.

1530
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,480
I didn't...

1531
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:29,300
Nothing happened.

1532
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:32,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

1533
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:33,500
Nothing happened.

1534
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,800
Wait, this is a fast car.

1535
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:38,720
This looks fast.

1536
02:01:43,540 --> 02:01:44,880
There's no body.

1537
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:46,440
No body means no evidence.

1538
02:01:46,460 --> 02:02:04,100
He's one nothing washed away Yeah, yeah, if anything it was hot shot I can't believe not only did he ram somebody and ram a car into the ocean He also he also drowned a paramedic.

1539
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:05,680
That's so fucked up sir.

1540
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:06,860
Thank you for the super chat.

1541
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:07,420
Thank you.

1542
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:08,260
Thank you

1543
02:02:18,490 --> 02:02:22,270
Yeah, I can't kill someone if there's no body I

1544
02:02:28,090 --> 02:02:40,430
anyway also does this look like an outfit of a murderer look at that also

1545
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:59,110
the car was in the ocean and a paramedic went out in the ocean to try to save them but it's just so sad he didn't make it guys he just didn't have the strength to swim that far it was so sad

1546
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:23,500
Like he managed to save the woman and the car, but he was just not strong enough to save himself How unfortunate he got the car though he used all his strength to

1547
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:34,020
That's my mom he tried with all his strength, but he used it all and get that car back onto land

1548
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:51,980
Holy shit the paces of him yet oh my god he's his car is so fast someone shoot the tires i should have brought a gun i wonder if i could bring a gun and just start shooting his car

1550
02:04:14,230 --> 02:04:16,630
I feel like I'm in like...

1551
02:04:16,630 --> 02:04:18,450
I feel like I'm some like...

1552
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:19,150
Oh, what's...

1553
02:04:19,150 --> 02:04:23,450
Oh my gosh, I'm trying to figure out like how to describe this feeling of this music.

1554
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:27,490
Is it D-pad?

1555
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:29,510
No, that's my phone.

1556
02:04:30,690 --> 02:04:31,570
That's my...

1557
02:04:31,570 --> 02:04:32,990
Oh, I actually paused.

1558
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:37,090
Oh, it's the left.

1559
02:04:39,710 --> 02:04:41,230
Oh, I went the wrong way.

1560
02:04:41,330 --> 02:04:42,970
Do you guys think I can catch up to him?

1561
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:45,610
This is a shortcut, right?

1562
02:04:47,110 --> 02:04:47,990
Oh, it is.

1563
02:04:50,350 --> 02:04:58,430
You're about to hear the awesome psychedelic from LFO, followed by Durbox, the dark dubstep track from Harmonic 313.

1564
02:04:58,510 --> 02:04:59,210
Wait, dubstep?

1565
02:04:59,650 --> 02:05:03,990
The big-time party vibe track, Parisian goldfish from Flying Lotus.

1566
02:05:04,510 --> 02:05:04,810
Oh.

1567
02:05:05,890 --> 02:05:06,570
Wait.

1568
02:05:07,030 --> 02:05:07,570
Ooh.

1569
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:10,330
Oh, I went to Aberdeen?

1570
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:12,310
Wait, this is Aberdeen?

1571
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:14,110
I went to Aberdeen Center.

1572
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:17,510
Okay, no, this is not a good dubstep.

1573
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:19,930
This is not a good dubstep.

1574
02:05:25,580 --> 02:05:27,180
Oh my god, I disabled his car.

1575
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:31,280
How the fuck do I disable this car?

1576
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:33,300
Did I do it?

1577
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:37,020
Come on!

1578
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,460
All right, how do I disable it?

1579
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:42,740
Do I just keep ramming it until he gets caught?

1580
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:49,350
All right.

1581
02:05:49,370 --> 02:05:50,590
Is it disabled?

1582
02:05:56,390 --> 02:05:57,610
Do I have to like ram it?

1583
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:00,110
That's it.

1584
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:02,310
Oh, there we go.

1585
02:06:02,710 --> 02:06:03,710
I did it.

1586
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:04,910
Oh, wait.

1587
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:06,970
Can I not do it?

1588
02:06:09,290 --> 02:06:10,250
Where is his car?

1589
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:12,670
Wait, did he flip back?

1590
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:16,750
How the fuck did he flip his...

1591
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:17,810
He lived that?

1592
02:06:18,890 --> 02:06:21,110
Bro, your car's on fire!

1593
02:06:22,930 --> 02:06:26,010
Your car is literally on fire, bro.

1594
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:27,590
Like, get out.

1595
02:06:28,030 --> 02:06:30,430
Like, get out of the car.

1596
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:37,170
His car is literally on fire.

1597
02:06:38,430 --> 02:06:39,170
We picked Tachana.

1598
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:40,750
Little Punk never shuts up.

1599
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,390
You should have seen the look on his face when we charged him with murder.

1600
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:43,810
Nice.

1601
02:06:44,090 --> 02:06:44,870
20 years at least.

1602
02:06:45,230 --> 02:06:45,710
Nobody pays much.

1603
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:48,430
Yeah, the three murders that he did.

1604
02:06:48,770 --> 02:06:51,910
The woman, the man, and the pyramid.

1605
02:06:52,270 --> 02:06:57,050
I can't believe it.

1606
02:06:57,390 --> 02:07:00,030
He murdered three people, guys.

1607
02:07:00,910 --> 02:07:02,990
Including the paramedic.

1608
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:04,810
Got high right.

1609
02:07:05,230 --> 02:07:06,390
Or high roller.

1610
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:08,410
Nice.

1611
02:07:09,190 --> 02:07:10,070
Got an upgrade.

1612
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:12,210
That's so fucked up.

1613
02:07:18,610 --> 02:07:22,790
I can't believe he committed three murders.

1614
02:07:23,890 --> 02:07:24,370
Fucking.

1615
02:07:24,410 --> 02:07:27,250

There's just too many people for me to grapple.

1749
02:17:58,590 --> 02:18:00,190
I'm such a saint, guys.

1750
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:02,710
Doing the bare minimum.

1754
02:18:15,130 --> 02:18:16,430
I'm such a saint.

1755
02:18:16,470 --> 02:18:17,530
Okay, that's enough now.

1756
02:18:18,330 --> 02:18:19,670

1759
02:18:22,410 --> 02:18:23,870
Oh, wait, nice.

1760
02:18:24,210 --> 02:18:26,470

Alright, get over here.

1762
02:18:31,350 --> 02:18:32,710
We're gonna have to feed the fishes.

1763
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:36,910
I'm glad you have self-restraint.

1764
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:41,230
There we go.

1765
02:18:43,350 --> 02:18:43,970
Oh my god.

1766
02:18:45,170 --> 02:18:47,230
And the body washed away.

1767
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:51,310
See?

1768
02:18:51,810 --> 02:18:53,290
I'm a good person.

1769
02:18:55,350 --> 02:18:56,550
Oh my god!

1770
02:18:57,570 --> 02:18:58,050
What?

1771
02:18:58,890 --> 02:19:00,250
Oh wait, that's not what I wanted.

1772
02:19:00,870 --> 02:19:01,730
There we go.

1773
02:19:02,910 --> 02:19:04,390
Give me a sec.

1774
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:08,390
Alright.

02:19:23,310 --> 02:19:27,470
Has to be- has to be- Whoa, what the fuck is that gun?

1778
02:19:28,290 --> 02:19:29,490
Has to be in the chest.

02:19:29,770 --> 02:19:30,410
No fun.

1780
02:19:32,910 --> 02:19:34,910
There's no way you survives that

1781
02:19:40,060 --> 02:19:48,880
We are We're giving that we're giving the people what they want the ass How do you survive 20 bullets in the ass?

1782
02:19:51,220 --> 02:19:52,260
Hostile down

1783
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:58,950
I think can you actually survive 20?

1784
02:19:59,270 --> 02:20:02,990
Okay if you just started firing at the ass like can you live through that?

1785
02:20:03,850 --> 02:20:15,710
Like it's just literally 20 bullets to the butt because it's just fat right it's just muscle and fat so as long as oh wait you can't and like and you don't bleed out

1786
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:41,400

1787
02:20:41,740 --> 02:20:50,180

1788
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:53,320
Or like it just hits the fat, you know?

1789
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:59,780

He shot me in the head.

1799
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:43,560
I got two.

1800
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:47,020
There was a guy that was like, oh man.

1801
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:47,720
Oh my god.

1802
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:48,700
He was all over again.

1803
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:50,180
Okay, I should not get distracted.

1804
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:51,820
All right, we're gonna headshot for real.

1805
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:52,780
No more butt shots.

1806
02:21:53,220 --> 02:21:54,960
Guys, no more butt shots.

1807
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,000
I didn't realize.

1808
02:21:59,140 --> 02:22:07,060
It's like that guy that was like trying to build immunity on bullet shots and shot himself like every, he shot himself every

1809
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:40,380
don't do that that's actually so fucking stupid he was micro he was literally trying to micro dose bullets yeah that that's like no i'm not joking that was legitimately a real thing there was a guy that tried to micro dose bullets and he was like he was like oh i couldn't i had to stop i hope someone else will continue my studies Holy fuck,

1810
02:22:40,580 --> 02:22:41,300
you're crazy.

1811
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:45,560
That's actually crazy.

1812
02:22:45,780 --> 02:22:50,840
And he's like, these are my, this is my study and I have to stop because I found the limit.

1813
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:56,760
He's like, I found my body's limit.

1814
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:01,160
Which is crazy.

1815
02:23:09,990 --> 02:23:10,890
There we go.

1816
02:23:15,860 --> 02:23:17,480
All right, I got cover.

1817
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:23,720
I'm actually aiming at their heads for real now.

1818
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:26,320
I was like, I'm not dealing with that.

1819
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:36,540
So anyways, so like on that topic, I wonder if you can like, I wonder how much your ass can take.

1820
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:39,720
Because it's technically just muscle and fat.

1821
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:45,000
Like there's no like, as long as you don't hit any important arteries.

1822
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:49,200
There should be a...

1823
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:51,500
Oh, shit.

1824
02:23:51,740 --> 02:23:52,720
See you later, motherfucker.

1825
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:54,600
I'm gonna fucking... I'm coming over.

1826
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:58,360
Guys, look, I have a helmet.

1827
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:00,080
A hat is technically a helmet.

1828
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:06,700
There we go.

1829
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:13,790
Guys, everything I say is a joke, by the way.

1830
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:14,690
Don't...

1831
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:19,930
Like, I gotta try to micro-dose fucking bullets.

1832
02:24:20,210 --> 02:24:21,690
I gotta... That's a joke.

1833
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:23,570
That's a joke, by the way.

1834

1936
02:32:01,650 --> 02:32:06,730
I'd say with my palest uniform, my palest friend.

There you go.

1941
02:32:32,420 --> 02:32:36,640
I only have, I have seven bullets, seven bullets to make this count.

1942
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:38,400
There you go.

1943
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:41,260
There you go.

1944
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:45,080
Okay, it doesn't help it that it does two damage per shot.

1945
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:46,300
Are you serious?

1946
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:48,060
Okay, give me a sec.

02:33:58,740 --> 02:34:00,640
Don't worry, everything is fine.

1964
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:05,280
Just an average day in Hong Kong, I guess.

1965

02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:43,200
I get to keep your purse.

2002
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:44,300
Going to my purse now.

2003
02:36:46,940 --> 02:36:47,340
Okay.

2004
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:48,360
Oh, my God.

2005
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:51,840
I picked everything but the white mask.

2006
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:57,140
That's right.

2007
02:36:58,020 --> 02:36:58,720
Oh, my God.

2008
02:36:58,800 --> 02:36:59,540
But what if?

2009
02:36:59,940 --> 02:37:00,820
What if I...

2010
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:01,880
Wait, wait a minute.

2011
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:04,760
Wait, I have an idea.

2012
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:07,860
I just need to get a little closer.

2013
02:37:08,720 --> 02:37:09,340
It goes with...

2014
02:37:09,340 --> 02:37:11,380
Yeah, it matches my outfit, guys.

2015
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:17,220
Yeah, they should have made the van yellow.

2016
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:18,040
Exactly.

2017
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:21,920
Okay, but what if, like...

2018
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:22,420
No!

2019
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:23,000
Jack!

2020
02:37:23,320 --> 02:37:23,580
No!

2021
02:37:28,150 --> 02:37:29,170
The throw button!

2022
02:37:29,550 --> 02:37:34,220
I was gonna throw...

2023
02:37:34,220 --> 02:37:37,140
I forgot which one was the throw button.

2024
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:38,560
No!

2025
02:37:38,840 --> 02:38:00,800

2030
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:19,260
I pressed why?

2031
02:39:25,230 --> 02:39:27,550
Okay, there you go.

2032
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:28,790
Who the fuck are you guys?

2033
02:39:29,230 --> 02:39:30,050
Change your tone, Shay.

2034
02:39:30,710 --> 02:39:31,250
Miss Yang?

2035
02:39:32,130 --> 02:39:32,830
Miss Yang?

2036
02:39:35,950 --> 02:39:38,310
I did not- I'm not driving the car.

2037
02:39:38,430 --> 02:39:40,790
My hands are actually off the controller.

2038
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:48,430
I can't believe it.

2039
02:39:48,430 --> 02:39:49,710
AI hates AI.

2040
02:39:50,910 --> 02:39:51,390
valuation.

2041
02:39:53,350 --> 02:39:54,330
I will get to the point.

2042
02:39:54,930 --> 02:39:58,690
You must realize that you cannot stand against Big Smile Lee alone.

2043
02:39:59,010 --> 02:40:00,110
That's what everyone tells me.

2044
02:40:00,670 --> 02:40:02,710
Roland Ho said I'd need other bosses to support me.

2045
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:05,410
Bro, it's in the back of the limousine.

2046
02:40:05,650 --> 02:40:06,690
How could it have been me?

2047
02:40:06,990 --> 02:40:08,770
I wasn't even in the scene of the crime.

2048
02:40:09,270 --> 02:40:09,270
Peace.

2049
02:40:09,890 --> 02:40:13,010
And I don't mind spilling a little blood to achieve it.

2050
02:40:14,430 --> 02:40:19,090
With Uncle Poe in the hospital, there's much uncertainty in the sun on Yi.

2051
02:40:19,590 --> 02:40:22,950
If he recovers, We will both be stable and strong.

2052
02:40:23,170 --> 02:40:26,750
But if he dies, the 18K presents a very real threat.

2053
02:40:27,190 --> 02:40:29,090
We cannot afford to appear weak.

2054
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:32,290
We will need to elect a new chairman quickly.

2055
02:40:33,430 --> 02:40:34,170
You, for instance.

2056
02:40:34,510 --> 02:40:39,470
Ah, Big Smile Lee represents a step backwards for the sun on you.

2057
02:40:40,170 --> 02:40:43,390
Why continue to force girls into prostitution and pornography?

2058
02:40:43,390 --> 02:40:44,570
Wait, we do that?

2059
02:40:44,830 --> 02:40:48,330
With other, less archaic, more profitable ways for us to make money.

2060
02:40:48,350 --> 02:40:50,530
Yes, it's time to force the boys.

2061
02:40:50,650 --> 02:41:24,370
to the man equality am I right but it would be a wise even for me to stand against big smiley unaided which brings me to you now we both appear to have the same problem Wei Shen and the opportunity to benefit if we work together so it seems I have my own reasons for hating big smiley's operation I feel like that's not what she's trying to imply.

2062
02:41:33,830 --> 02:41:34,210
Damn.

2063
02:41:35,790 --> 02:41:37,750
Oh, I guess she's the new boss now.

2064
02:41:42,940 --> 02:41:43,980
Alright, new story.

2065
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:45,780
Drugs, hookers, and boring.

2066
02:41:46,060 --> 02:41:46,380
What?

2067
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:48,720
What is this story?

2068
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:52,600
Some fucker named Naz is ripping me off at the top, Glamour.

2069
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:53,400
Need your help.

2070
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:55,940
read this report.

2071
02:41:58,120 --> 02:42:00,420
I'm curious what this report.

2072
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:00,960
Okay.

2073
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:03,520
Drugs, hookers, pornography.

2074
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:08,220
And these are the pillars of the rising crime empire in Hong Kong is hardly surprising.

2075
02:42:08,780 --> 02:42:13,040
These tyrants have controlled the drug rackets and sex trade for more than a hundred years.

2076
02:42:13,540 --> 02:42:14,200
Holy shit.

2077
02:42:16,660 --> 02:42:25,920
Some speaking on a report that he has been paying, parlayed his cash flow into a prime position It is now heir apparent to Sun Yi, On Yi, and possibly Olive.

2078
02:42:29,500 --> 02:42:33,780
The filmmakers wanted in on the lucrative porn industry, and Lee had the best women.

2079
02:42:34,260 --> 02:42:37,980
In return, Lee got access to the multi-billion dollar industry.

2080
02:42:38,380 --> 02:42:41,920
A large sum of money moved from one shell corporation to the next.

2081
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:42,880
Oh, shit.

2082
02:42:42,940 --> 02:42:44,900
He got in on the porn industry.

2083
02:42:45,700 --> 02:42:46,060
Wow.

2084
02:42:48,660 --> 02:42:51,560
I swear, I will say...

2085
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:54,150
Whoever...

2086
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:55,620
That's right.

2087
02:42:56,140 --> 02:42:57,840
The police give me their car!

2088
02:42:59,420 --> 02:43:07,920
I will say the genius who discovered streaming porn must be a millionaire.

2089
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:16,440
Whoever that guy is is a goddamn millionaire right now.

2090
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:18,080
Wall Street.

2091
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:18,860
Oh wait.

2092
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:21,700
Loose and cop job.

2093
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:27,320
Or, no, not million, sorry, billionaire.

2094
02:43:32,430 --> 02:43:34,650
They have to be billionaires.

2095
02:43:38,780 --> 02:43:40,440
There's a movie about it?

2096
02:43:44,460 --> 02:43:44,940
Oh, yeah.

2097
02:43:45,900 --> 02:43:50,260
And if they pattern it, that is, like, the smartest thing they've ever done.

2098
02:43:50,380 --> 02:43:51,860
Imagine trademarking porn.

2099
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:57,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2100
02:44:04,380 --> 02:44:06,740
You know what's even crazier?

2101
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:10,240
I'm pretty sure it was pre-Netflix, too.

2102
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:16,700
Now that I think about it, that had to be pre-Netflix.

2103
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:18,480
I just realized.

2104
02:44:23,480 --> 02:44:33,500
The fact that we came up with bad idea before we came up with streaming TV shows and movies, like priorities, you know?

2105
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:36,740
For actual priorities.

2106
02:44:43,250 --> 02:44:44,770
Was it pre-YouTube?

2107
02:44:45,330 --> 02:44:48,590
Oh my god, the fact that that's pre-YouTube?

2108
02:44:49,230 --> 02:44:51,270
Wait, you won't believe what those assholes did.

2109
02:44:51,970 --> 02:44:53,130
Those guys are top glamor.

2110
02:44:53,150 --> 02:44:53,970
The pioneer.

2111
02:44:54,950 --> 02:44:56,230
They brought them another load of watches.

2112
02:44:56,630 --> 02:44:58,890
They were supposed to give me 200,000 for them.

2113
02:44:59,010 --> 02:45:00,630
Instead, they give me this hunk of shit.

2114
02:45:01,290 --> 02:45:02,710
I don't even know how to ride this thing.

2115
02:45:02,830 --> 02:45:03,730
I have to push it here.

2116
02:45:04,270 --> 02:45:04,710
Calm down.

2117
02:45:05,810 --> 02:45:06,390
Give me the bike.

2118
02:45:06,690 --> 02:45:07,470
I'll get you your money.

2119
02:45:07,690 --> 02:45:08,330
What are you gonna do?

2120
02:45:09,210 --> 02:45:09,910
Same thing I always do.

2121
02:45:09,930 --> 02:45:13,110
I always do, Jackie.

2122
02:45:13,830 --> 02:45:14,470
What do we do?

2123
02:45:15,010 --> 02:45:15,530
Wait, what is?

2124
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:17,010
I do a lot of stuff way.

2125
02:45:17,210 --> 02:45:18,510
You gotta be more specific.

2126
02:45:18,950 --> 02:45:19,570
Like, what do you mean?

2127
02:45:19,570 --> 02:45:21,090
Same thing like I always do.

2128
02:45:21,170 --> 02:45:23,030
We've done so many things.

2129
02:45:23,590 --> 02:45:25,910
So many very legal things.

2130
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:34,720
Except for drowning people.

2131
02:45:34,820 --> 02:45:36,540
I've never went that far.

2132
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:40,080
That was, that's the one line I'll never cross.

2133
02:45:48,550 --> 02:45:48,990
Wee!

2134
02:45:49,810 --> 02:45:52,330
You gonna

2135
02:45:55,810 --> 02:45:56,530
let me in?

2136
02:45:57,110 --> 02:45:57,990
Knock, knock!

2137
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:05,390
Alright, go to the shipping yard.

2138
02:46:09,390 --> 02:46:09,490
What?

2139
02:46:10,410 --> 02:46:12,170
But actually I can do it from here, that's good.

2140
02:46:15,190 --> 02:46:16,890
Alright, that's easier too.

2141
02:46:28,090 --> 02:46:28,530
What?

2142
02:46:28,530 --> 02:46:29,390
Who is he?

2143
02:46:29,470 --> 02:46:31,490
I don't even know who he is.

2144
02:46:32,430 --> 02:46:33,870
You're sitting on it.

2145
02:46:34,210 --> 02:46:36,090
And when you get off strong-arming me, huh?

2146
02:46:36,250 --> 02:46:37,750
I know you're a cop and I know you're sick.

2147
02:46:37,770 --> 02:46:39,470
How would you know?

2148
02:46:40,150 --> 02:46:41,290
How would you know?

2149
02:46:41,930 --> 02:46:44,950
This is Polis, my Polis.

2150
02:46:45,750 --> 02:46:47,710
It's the newest luxury brand.

2151
02:46:48,610 --> 02:46:49,810
How would he know?

2152
02:46:52,610 --> 02:46:54,350
I don't understand.

2153
02:46:58,890 --> 02:46:59,450
I'm...

2154
02:46:59,470 --> 02:47:00,350
Undercover!

2155
02:47:02,050 --> 02:47:09,160
We're gonna get these guys out of here.

2156
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:12,480
I'm literally undercover.

2157
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:15,760
Woo!

2158
02:47:16,900 --> 02:47:18,280
Fast and Furious!

2159
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:20,800
Wait, what do I do from here?

2160
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:21,060
Oh.

2161
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:24,480
There we go.

2162
02:47:33,860 --> 02:47:35,940
Because we're in the Fast and Furious movie.

2163
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:38,660
That's why it explode when the tire is shot.

2164
02:47:41,860 --> 02:47:42,960
Come on, fuckers!

2165
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:49,400
It's okay.

2166
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:50,620
He won't die.

2167
02:47:51,960 --> 02:47:53,500
Wait, we put Nas in the truck?

2168
02:47:53,720 --> 02:47:54,560
Where is the truck?

2169
02:47:57,560 --> 02:47:58,800
Wait, does he die?

2170
02:48:00,940 --> 02:48:02,260
Give me a sec.

2171
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:03,260
I'm testing Ethereum.

2172
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:18,160
Where's the truck?

2173
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:22,740
Oh, is it this one?

2174
02:48:30,820 --> 02:48:31,580
There you go.

2175
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:33,200
There you go.

2176

Okay, there you go.

2177
02:48:34,860 --> 02:48:35,660
Go in the trunk.

2178
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:36,920
Go in here.

2179
02:48:37,380 --> 02:48:38,720

Get in here.

2181
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:43,360
He did it.

2182
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:46,260
He successfully micro-dosed down bullets.

2183
02:48:46,720 --> 02:48:48,380
And he has gain in unity.

2184
02:48:54,180 --> 02:48:55,480
I'm just gonna go straight.

2185
02:48:58,040 --> 02:48:58,440
Get rid of him.

2187
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:04,860

02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:16,920
You know what?

2191
02:49:26,050 --> 02:49:28,530

We did it.

2195
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:42,530
You only have yourself to play.

2196

2197
02:49:47,730 --> 02:49:48,850

2199
02:49:51,710 --> 02:49:52,630
There we go.

2200
02:49:53,690 --> 02:49:54,950
It was just that easy.

2201
02:49:55,890 --> 02:49:57,730
I was like, why am I driving?

2202
02:49:58,250 --> 02:50:00,850
Why am I making this harder for myself?

2203
02:50:02,210 --> 02:50:02,690
Inspector?

2204

That's all I'm gonna say.

2220

I'll take care of it.

2222
02:51:27,060 --> 02:51:29,220

03:04:04,460 --> 03:04:05,180
That's right.

2357
03:04:05,560 --> 03:04:06,360
I'm the killer.

2358
03:04:06,760 --> 03:04:09,200
I'm Freddy and five nights at Freddy's.

2359
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:10,300
Wait, no, it's golden.

2360
03:04:10,500 --> 03:04:11,020
Oh shit.

2361
03:04:11,340 --> 03:04:11,820
Oh shit.

2362
03:04:12,080 --> 03:04:13,300
I'm trying to think of one-liners.

2363
03:04:13,520 --> 03:04:14,140
It's been a while.

2364
03:04:16,840 --> 03:04:19,880
No one's gonna save you from golden Freddy.

2365
03:04:22,020 --> 03:04:23,400
The hook of 87.

2366
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:26,980
Guys, it's obvious I don't play Dead by Daylight.

2367
03:04:27,160 --> 03:04:28,300
It's literally just tag.

2368
03:04:30,740 --> 03:04:32,140
It's just tag.

2369
03:04:33,100 --> 03:04:35,220
Dead by Daylight is just tagged.

2370
03:04:40,780 --> 03:04:41,180
Yes!

2371
03:04:42,620 --> 03:04:44,660
If you think that's bad.

2372
03:04:47,220 --> 03:04:48,560
Alright, dodge.

2373
03:04:48,920 --> 03:04:50,000
Like, I feel like...

2374
03:04:50,980 --> 03:04:52,080
Okay, ball punch.

2375
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:57,260
Are you ready to get...

2376
03:04:57,260 --> 03:04:58,300
Get shanked?

2377
03:04:58,680 --> 03:05:01,240
This is London, but acting the ocean.

2378
03:05:02,380 --> 03:05:03,340
Ocean man!

2379
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:13,160

2380
03:05:13,640 --> 03:05:27,500
Oh, there it is That's right I'll tell you a little secret I'm actually the ocean killer Ocean man But No

2381
03:05:34,480 --> 03:05:35,680
No way!

2382
03:05:36,900 --> 03:05:37,980
He can't tell that...

2383
03:05:37,980 --> 03:05:40,100
He can't... Dead man can't tell tales.

2384
03:05:44,220 --> 03:05:45,640
Alright, I'll get this guy.

2385
03:05:46,780 --> 03:05:47,380
Oh shit.

2386
03:05:48,220 --> 03:05:49,560
Okay, I actually have to just do counters.

2387
03:05:51,400 --> 03:05:53,380
I'm so low HP right now.

2388
03:05:55,820 --> 03:05:56,500
Oh shit!

2389
03:05:57,800 --> 03:05:58,400
What?!

2390
03:05:58,400 --> 03:06:00,580
There's still HP there!

2391
03:06:01,600 --> 03:06:03,620
Draw him, not tell, no tales.

2392
03:06:04,200 --> 03:06:05,360
Oh my god.

2393
03:06:05,380 --> 03:06:06,620
No, not again.

2394
03:06:08,920 --> 03:06:10,120
Ocean man.

2395
03:06:10,480 --> 03:06:10,760
Bye.

2396
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2397
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:15,680
Da, no, no.

2398
03:06:17,100 --> 03:06:18,180
Ocean man.

2399
03:06:18,320 --> 03:06:19,840
Wait, actually, I have an idea.

2400
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:20,200
Okay.

2401
03:06:20,640 --> 03:06:23,720
I think this bot is already demonetized anyway, so it's fine.

2402
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:26,860
I...

2403
03:06:27,740 --> 03:06:29,180
I'm pretty sure.

2404
03:06:29,600 --> 03:06:31,040
I'm pretty sure.

2405
03:06:32,720 --> 03:06:35,360
I'm pretty sure this bot is already demonetized.

2406
03:06:46,340 --> 03:06:47,840
Oh shit.

2407
03:07:02,660 --> 03:07:03,920
Ocean man.

2408
03:07:07,900 --> 03:07:09,440
Wait, you guys can't hear it?

2409
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:11,340
Give me a sec.

2410
03:07:16,750 --> 03:07:17,530
Like Nance.

2411
03:07:18,290 --> 03:07:19,610
Ocean man.

2412
03:07:21,390 --> 03:07:23,370
Last time by the sand.

2413
03:07:24,030 --> 03:07:25,430
But not not not.

2414
03:07:26,130 --> 03:07:27,290
Ocean man.

2415
03:07:33,670 --> 03:07:58,790
Ocean man Oh my god, oh my god, I'm literally getting fucked up by these guys These guys are so tanky Look at them go What the fuck Ocean man Ocean man Ocean man Ocean man

2416
03:08:04,700 --> 03:08:06,800
Ocean man

2417
03:08:12,460 --> 03:08:31,520
Ocean man Ocean man Ocean man Ocean man Ocean man Ocean man Don Don Ocean man Ocean man

2418
03:08:38,360 --> 03:08:41,820
How is this fight still going on?

2419
03:08:42,340 --> 03:08:43,720
The song has ended.

2420
03:08:44,500 --> 03:08:45,140
How...

2421
03:08:45,140 --> 03:08:50,060
How dinky are they?

2422
03:08:50,960 --> 03:08:54,780
The song has ended and I'm still fighting them.

2423
03:09:01,620 --> 03:09:03,820
There we go!

2424
03:09:09,020 --> 03:09:14,040
That's the song I play before the ocean man gets you.

2425
03:09:19,420 --> 03:09:20,880
Alright, it's your turn.

2426
03:09:22,120 --> 03:09:23,280
There we go.

2427
03:09:27,380 --> 03:09:27,860
Come on.

2428
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:30,840
There we go, get out of here.

2429
03:09:31,520 --> 03:09:34,300
The ocean man strikes again.

2430
03:09:34,320 --> 03:09:35,960
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

2431
03:09:38,220 --> 03:09:38,480
Get out.

2432
03:09:42,850 --> 03:09:43,770
That's right.

2433
03:09:46,710 --> 03:09:48,650
Get your arm out of here.

2434
03:09:49,330 --> 03:09:50,610
The ocean punch.

2435
03:09:51,970 --> 03:09:54,550
Alright, we gotta make sure I don't accidentally it.

2436
03:09:57,350 --> 03:09:58,930
Alright, if the VOD is got...

2437
03:09:58,930 --> 03:09:59,530
I'm sorry.

2438
03:10:04,770 --> 03:10:05,650
That's okay.

2439
03:10:06,650 --> 03:10:13,950
Means I could, I will, if the, if the bond gets striked where it gets blocked, this entire, this entire fight is gone.

2440
03:10:14,330 --> 03:10:21,530
This, this, we just lose this, it'll just, this entire fight just gets deleted.

2441
03:10:23,890 --> 03:10:25,010
So weird.

2442
03:10:26,910 --> 03:10:28,750
We mean so long goes.

2443
03:10:28,930 --> 03:10:30,230
Oh shit, oops, sorry.

2444
03:10:31,190 --> 03:10:33,290
The wedding happened like yesterday.

2445
03:10:33,830 --> 03:10:34,850
What do you mean?

2446
03:10:36,790 --> 03:10:37,690
Oh, oops.

2447
03:10:38,250 --> 03:10:38,250
Sorry.

2448
03:10:38,750 --> 03:10:39,250
Is he dead?

2449
03:10:39,410 --> 03:10:40,150
He's still alive.

2450
03:10:40,370 --> 03:10:40,610
Okay.

2451
03:10:41,070 --> 03:10:43,510
Look, they just said bring him alive, okay?

2452
03:10:43,730 --> 03:10:45,810
They didn't say how alive he has to be.

2453
03:10:47,870 --> 03:10:49,630
They never said how alive.

2454
03:10:53,400 --> 03:10:54,280
Where are we going?

2455
03:10:54,560 --> 03:10:55,160
To the restaurant.

2456
03:10:56,360 --> 03:10:56,820
Oh, wait.

2457
03:10:57,100 --> 03:10:57,360
Oh, wait.

2458
03:10:57,360 --> 03:10:58,060
I'm not the driver.

2459
03:10:58,180 --> 03:10:58,700
Thank God.

2460
03:10:59,800 --> 03:11:00,720
Can I change the radio?

2461
03:11:01,340 --> 03:11:02,660
We're bringing him to Mrs. Chu.

2462
03:11:03,020 --> 03:11:04,440
She has something she wants to tell him.

2463
03:11:04,660 --> 03:11:05,340
Mrs. Chu.

2464
03:11:05,840 --> 03:11:06,040
Alright.

2465
03:11:06,320 --> 03:11:06,480
Alright.

2466
03:11:07,840 --> 03:11:08,280
Yeah.

2467
03:11:08,400 --> 03:11:10,060
What a lovely drive.

2468
03:11:10,320 --> 03:11:29,000
What a lovely What a lovely quiet drive where no murder happened Put it on softly the ocean that played softly as we drive the misses I am the passenger.

2469
03:11:29,320 --> 03:11:30,440
Oh, wait, it's time to shoot.

2470
03:11:30,720 --> 03:11:33,460
God damn it God damn it.

2471
03:11:33,660 --> 03:11:37,800
It's time to shoot Can't have nothing

2472
03:11:45,100 --> 03:11:46,340
Oh, nice

2473
03:11:52,030 --> 03:11:53,610
easy.

2474
03:11:53,990 --> 03:11:54,490
That's a card.

2475
03:11:55,130 --> 03:11:55,870
Okay, that's nice.

2476
03:11:56,070 --> 03:11:57,670
The card exploded itself.

2477
03:11:59,550 --> 03:11:59,830
There you go.

2478
03:12:00,390 --> 03:12:01,750
Oh yeah, my card's not okay.

2479
03:12:01,970 --> 03:12:03,670
I think I got shot a little too much.

2480
03:12:06,150 --> 03:12:07,470
What the fuck?

2481
03:12:07,690 --> 03:12:09,750
That motorcycle just spawned in front of me.

2482
03:12:14,320 --> 03:12:17,280
This is the perfect car chase on.

2483
03:12:21,220 --> 03:12:21,700
Hallelujah.

2484
03:12:22,440 --> 03:12:24,000
Oh my god!

2485
03:12:24,460 --> 03:12:25,560
Is my car okay?

2486
03:12:28,020 --> 03:12:28,540
There you go.

2487
03:12:31,160 --> 03:12:32,440
There's still one more behind.

2488
03:12:33,440 --> 03:12:34,600
I think I got it.

2489
03:12:35,920 --> 03:12:37,440
Let's got shoot at the general director.

2490
03:12:38,040 --> 03:12:38,040
Reloading!

2491
03:12:41,910 --> 03:12:42,770
There you go.

2492
03:12:45,170 --> 03:12:48,790
There's no way I can reach all the- is that- are these guys also part of it?

2493
03:12:49,330 --> 03:12:49,950
Can't tell.

2494
03:12:53,940 --> 03:12:54,640
There you go.

2495
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:57,600
There's still one more car.

2496
03:12:59,920 --> 03:13:01,360
Okay, there's still another car.

2497
03:13:01,960 --> 03:13:03,960
Holy shit, how far has Mrs. Shoes been?

2498
03:13:06,640 --> 03:13:07,520
There you go.

2499
03:13:07,940 --> 03:13:08,540
Oh, we're here.

2500
03:13:09,420 --> 03:13:10,000
We'll see.

2501
03:13:12,540 --> 03:13:12,780
Yay!

2502
03:13:15,100 --> 03:13:17,080
Some good driving there.

2503
03:13:18,420 --> 03:13:18,940
Thanks, man.

2504
03:13:19,140 --> 03:13:19,880
We did it.

2505
03:13:21,340 --> 03:13:21,820
All right.

2506
03:13:22,280 --> 03:13:23,220
Do you think he's okay?

2507
03:13:24,020 --> 03:13:25,360
Surely the bullets.

2508
03:13:25,440 --> 03:13:26,940
Did not hit the trunk, right?

2509
03:13:27,340 --> 03:13:28,120
Yeah, he's fine.

2510
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:30,660
Your people are really bad shots.

2511
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,360
I don't understand how they did not hit the trunk.

2512
03:13:33,400 --> 03:13:36,640
Sit down and shut the fuck up.

2513
03:13:42,080 --> 03:13:45,100
Jesus, I haven't been here in fucking years.

2514
03:13:45,540 --> 03:13:48,400
Sammy, I've waited on you while you're in the kitchen.

2515
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:49,000
You can see?

2516
03:13:49,440 --> 03:13:50,840
I'll leave my blood in the living.

2517
03:13:51,040 --> 03:13:52,520
You don't like it, right?

2518
03:13:52,900 --> 03:13:53,760
It's cool, Mrs. Choo.

2519
03:13:54,120 --> 03:13:54,720
I already ate.

2520
03:13:54,760 --> 03:13:55,720
Oh my God, Jesus.

2521
03:13:57,980 --> 03:13:59,920
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

2522
03:14:00,380 --> 03:14:02,000
Oh my god, it's his ear!

2523
03:14:03,640 --> 03:14:04,720
Oh my god!

2524
03:14:07,360 --> 03:14:10,140
He's feeding his Johnny red eyes!

2525
03:14:11,120 --> 03:14:11,920
A red face!

2526
03:14:12,620 --> 03:14:13,380
A red face?

2527
03:14:13,500 --> 03:14:15,020
A friend of Johnny.

2528
03:14:15,440 --> 03:14:16,360
A little shoo-zai?

2529
03:14:18,820 --> 03:14:20,600
He's not even calling him red face.

2530
03:14:20,700 --> 03:14:22,200
He just says he's a rat in general.

2531
03:14:22,620 --> 03:14:26,720
A little shoo-j- Wait, if you have a problem with me, then let's sort it out ourselves.

2532
03:14:26,740 --> 03:14:27,500
A little shoo-zai?

2533
03:14:27,960 --> 03:14:29,700
It's just rap boy

03:14:35,860 --> 03:14:45,720

All right, I'm going to call it.

2544
03:15:27,860 --> 03:15:29,800

2548
03:15:36,180 --> 03:15:40,540
Oh my god, oh no, he is definitely filled with PTSD right now.

2549
03:15:40,860 --> 03:15:42,300
He ain't looking too good, guys.

2550
03:15:42,320 --> 03:15:45,320
I think he's too deep and undercover guys

2551
03:15:49,180 --> 03:15:59,080
