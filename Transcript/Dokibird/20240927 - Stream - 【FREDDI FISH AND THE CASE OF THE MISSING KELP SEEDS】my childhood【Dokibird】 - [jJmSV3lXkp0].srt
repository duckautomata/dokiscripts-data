1
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Oh shit.

2
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,660
Oh, sorry.

3
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,500
I didn't even realize I... I wasn't even connected.

4
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,920
Sorry.

5
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
It was... the food was really good.

6
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,820
That's my... that's my only excuse.

7
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,440
The food was too good.

8
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,940
Um, yeah, I had to loop because it was like a... what was it?

9
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,280
It's like... it's like... it's like...

10
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,040
um, oh my god.

11
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,720
It was like some bread thing with like... it was like smoked salmon on top of it.

12
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,980
And it was really, really good.

13
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,480
And like, it's one of my favorite places right now.

14
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,780
Um, that I order for like breakfast slash lunch stuff.

15
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,640
Anyway, let me take a bite out of this too.

16
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,820
I also ordered a croissant.

17
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,660
There's a lot of bread.

18
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,620
But, um, no, it's not a sandwich.

19
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,660
It's like...

20
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,260
Okay, let me...

21
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,220
Let me look.

22
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,520
I'm gonna be like... I'm gonna be loading in real quick.

23
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,580
Let me see what it is.

24
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,320
I won't say what it is exactly.

25
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,140
But it's like...

26
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,840
Oh, tart... tartine.

27
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,520
Tartan?

28
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,560
Is that what it's called?

29
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,420
Tartan?

30
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,340
Um, it's like smoked salmon tartan.

31
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,260
I think that's how you pronounce it.

32
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,620
Um, but it's so good.

33
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,860
It's like one of my favorite places to order at the moment.

34
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,120
Um, no, it's like T-A-R.

35
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
T-I-N-T-E.

36
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,280
Wait, is that how you spell it?

37
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,360
T-A-R-T-I-N-E.

38
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,680
Sorry.

39
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,260
T-A-R-T-I-N-E.

40
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,800
It's a smoked salmon tartan.

41
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,120
And it's like my first time ordering something.

42
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:13,040
Not my first time, but ever since I ordered that, I've been like, um, I've been like ordering it quite...

43
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,920
Like, not like regularly, but like at least like once a week because it's just so good.

44
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,940
Like, it's just really, really good.

45
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,040
Um, Kasha's dad, thank you for the super chat.

46
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,960
Thank you, thank you.

47
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,540
Your very first super chat too.

48
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,720
Hi Toki, second time ever getting to participate in your stream.

49
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,120
As soon as the Dragoon won at loop number five, would that be possible?

50
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,220
I mean, that means I can eat more of my croissants, so sure.

51
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,440
Loop number five!

52
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,000
JK.

53
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,480
JK.

54
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,840
That's five.

55
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,120
That's ten Canadian dollars worth of loop number five.

56
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,160
I just want to take a bite out of that and see how it tastes like now that I finished my bite.

57
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:31,560
It's time to actually stream like, no, why Toki, you know, you know why, you know, because you guys, okay.

58
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,900
You guys want to know exactly why?

59
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,660
Because I ordered a drink and they didn't give me a fucking straw.

60
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,120
So now I take my anger out.

61
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,540
On you, Dragoons.

62
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:52,360
Because I don't have a straw for my drink and I have to drink it like a fucking caveman.

63
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm going to take their anger out on you.

64
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,260
It's going to be a paper straw.

65
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,680
I don't have straws in my new apartment.

66
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,620
Okay, I know it's like new, new, even though I've been like living here for like two months now.

67
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,320
I don't have any straws, guys.

68
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,080
I have forks.

69
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,660
I have forks.

70
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,340
I have knives.

71
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,860
I have spoons, but no straws.

72
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,640
You know what's even worse?

73
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,060
They gave me a fucking, they gave me a fucking fork.

74
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,340
And I'm like, why do I need a fork?

75
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,860
I'm eating a sandwich.

76
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,140
I'm eating a sandwich.

77
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,840
Like everything I ordered, like stuff that I eat with hands.

78
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,080
I was like, why did they give me a fucking fork, but no straw?

79
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,060
That's the only thing that I needed.

80
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm just, I can't believe it.

81
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,380
Yeah, so like, um, that's why I'm mad.

82
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,080
That's why you don't get an intro, you don't get intro number five.

83
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,100
Hmm.

84
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,600
That's why I own metal straws.

85
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,120
JL, thank you for the super chat.

86
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,500
Thank you.

87
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:13,880
Thank you.

88
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,060
Dude, metal straws taste fucking nasty.

89
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,640
I know it's like for the environment and everything, but like, it's just, it's like the metallic, it just makes things taste metallically.

90
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,380
And I'm like, I don't fuck with that.

91
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,080
I know, and also paper straws suck.

92
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:37,700
Why did we destroy, why did we destroy a planet so fast that now everything has to be out of paper metal?

93
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,720
Why can't, why can't that be the next generation?

94
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Why?

95
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,660
I'm sorry, that's really fucked up.

96
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,000
I, why do we have to go through with this?

97
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,380
Is that fair?

98
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,540
Don't keep me off.

99
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,040
We are the next, this is exactly why.

100
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,280
Being the final generation sucks.

101
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,560
The board of boomers sucks.

102
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:11,560
The board of boomers sucks.

103
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:11,560
The board of boomers sucks.

104
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:11,560
The board of boomers sucks.

105
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:11,560
The board of boomers sucks.

106
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:11,580
The board of boomers sucks.

107
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,640
The board of boomers sucks.

108
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,100
The board of boomers sucks.

109
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,100
The board of boomers sucks.

110
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,480
The board of boomers sucks.iec Yikes, I'm so sad.

111
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,260
We destroyed our planet way too fast that it has to affect us.

112
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:32,080
Because, like, okay, the reason why I think it's not fair, is that I grew up when we had plastic straws.

113
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,820
But now we have to transition to either metal straws or paper straws.

114
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,580
The next generation, they never grew up with plastic straws.

115
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,180
So they don't know what they missed out on.

116
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,700
They think paper and metal straws are the norm.

117
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,820
So they don't know what it was like with plastic.

118
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,660
They don't know.

119
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,540
They don't know what it was like.

120
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,220
And they don't understand.

121
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,100
So they don't know what they lost.

122
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,060
But we do.

123
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,300
We know what we lost.

124
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,960
They know what we lost.

125
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,680
I'd rather be born in the next generation.

126
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:29,740
Than be born in the generation where we had plastic straws and now we can't have them anymore.

127
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,780
You can still buy plastic straws but they're so...

128
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,540
I don't really fucking...

129
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,340
The price is like expensive.

130
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,200
Or they don't have it.

131
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,980
Because they're like, you know, we're trying to save the environment.

132
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,080
Which is justified.

133
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,240
Like we gotta save the planet.

134
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,060
But still, it's just...

135
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:58,020
I can't believe I had to grow up in a time where I have to miss plastic straws.

136
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,800
Anyway.

137
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,540
Stop feeding us microplastic.

138
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:10,760
Anyway.

139
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,920
Well, yeah.

140
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,480
Anyway.

141
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,280
Life update.

142
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,260
Life update, guys.

143
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,600
Sorry.

144
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,780
I got a message from Surefour.

145
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,500
Because...

146
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,820
I got...

147
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,780
There was like this...

148
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,540
There's like a tournament thing for Deadlock.

149
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,180
And they were like, do you want to be captain?

150
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,560
And I was like, I don't play Deadlock.

151
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,020
I was like, I don't play Deadlock.

152
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,040
I don't play Deadlock.

153
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,560
And I asked Surefour.

154
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,780
I was like, Surefour, do you want to...

155
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,400
Do you want to join this...

156
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Me joining this tournament is dependent on if Surefour joins my team.

157
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,520
Because I was like, I don't play it.

158
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,120
So I know he plays.

159
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,720
And then, anyway.

160
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,280
His first response was...

161
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,080
Have you even played Deadlock this month?

162
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,140
I will!

163
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,200
On tomorrow!

164
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,100
He's like, have you even played at all this month?

165
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,520
He's like, have you even played at all this month?

166
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,960
He's like, I will!

167
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,920
I will tomorrow!

168
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,740
He's like, I will tomorrow!

169
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,520
Anyway, me joining the tournament.

170
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,380
Really, heavily depends on if Surefour says yes.

171
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,840
If he says no, then I know I'm fucked.

172
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,120
If he says no, then I know I'm fucked.

173
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,140
Because I don't know how to play this game.

174
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,060
Because I don't know how to play this game.

175
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,080
Anyway, life update.

176
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,100
Yesterday was hell.

177
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:49,460
So, right after the stream, I did errands, um, I did errands until, until I got home at 8pm.

178
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:58,280
I, oh my god, if he, if my, if my bank teller watches my stream right now, I fucking hate you.

179
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:11,680
Okay, I, I, there's the, okay, so, like, every time I walk to the bank, I always get this specific bank teller.

180
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:26,160
Like, not always, but, like, 80% of the time, 80% of the time, he is my bank teller, because whenever I get there, um, he's there working at the, at the station, you know?

181
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:38,780
So, like, I always see, like, I always have to go to him, but, like, oh, anyway, he knows that, like, I'm, um, he knows that, like, the business is, because, like, I go to him for the business account and everything.

182
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,660
So, like, I don't know if he'll look it up, but if he...

183
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,140
If he does, and he watches me, I don't like you.

184
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,340
Please let me have another bank teller.

185
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,900
I really don't like you.

186
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,160
Because, like...

187
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,740
The reason why, the reason why is that...

188
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,620
Oh, like, I think he knows, because I was, I was, I'm always so annoying.

189
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm like...

190
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,060
Like, the reason why...

191
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,620
Because, like, he, like, makes it so much more complicated than it should be.

192
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,080
So, I was doing a wire transfer, right?

193
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,780
I was doing a wire...

194
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,680
I was doing a wire transfer yesterday, and then I was like, okay, I want to do this wire transfer.

195
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,960
And then he was like, why don't you do a bank draft?

196
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,300
And I was like, a bank draft?

197
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,020
No, like, fine, I can do a wire transfer.

198
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,560
He's like, no, no, you should do a bank draft.

199
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,900
Because it's, like, like, because, like, it's already close by, like, the neighboring bank that you're supposed to wire transfer to.

200
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,540
It's close by.

201
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,400
And I was like...

202
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,420
Oh, okay.

203
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,740
And then he was, like, prepping the bank draft.

204
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,740
And then I looked up the neighboring bank.

205
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,160
And it was closed!

206
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,620
And I was like, why the fuck did you suggest it?

207
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,070
Thank God I looked it up.

208
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,950
Because, like, I was like, okay, let me look up where it is.

209
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,810
And it was, like, closed.

210
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,450
And I was like, are you fucking serious?

211
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,470
Because he's like, it's cheaper.

212
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,130
Like, you don't have to pay a $50 fee if you do a bank draft.

213
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,690
And I was like, no, no, that's okay.

214
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,770
I don't, I don't care.

215
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,210
Like, I'm willing to pay the $50 fee.

216
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,150
Because I just want to get it over.

217
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,530
With, like, it's fine.

218
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,970
And he's like, no, no, it's just easier and cheaper.

219
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,530
And then he was, like, pushing it.

220
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,690
And I was like, okay, I don't want to, like, alright.

221
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,870
And then, like, and I was like, okay, I want to do a wire transfer instead.

222
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,610
And then, like, and then, like, he was like, wait, what's the business name?

223
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,130
And I was like, oh, isn't it in the email?

224
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,930
He's like, no, no, it's not in the email.

225
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,870
Is this a personal account or a business?

226
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,630
And I was like, well, it's being sent from this guy's email.

227
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,810
And it says his name.

228
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,210
So, maybe it's personal.

229
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,390
So, I got really confused.

230
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,410
I was like, I thought there was a business name in there.

231
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,210
And then I, like, texted the person I was supposed to wire transfer to.

232
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,710
And they're like, yeah, it's in the email.

233
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,770
This is the business name.

234
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,210
And I was like, what the fuck?

235
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,010
Like, I was just like, why the fuck did he keep saying that wasn't the business name?

236
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,770
And then, at that point, because he was like, okay, can you, like, sidestep?

237
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,790
And then I'm going to help the person behind you because it's taking too long.

238
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:12,130
And then, like, you know, when it's, oh, when I finish with this person, I'll get you back in the line.

239
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:12,730
Okay.

240
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,350
I was like, okay.

241
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,690
And then, like, and then the other bank teller, there was another bank teller there.

242
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,950
And then he was like, oh, hey, I'm free right now.

243
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,290
And I was like, oh, okay.

244
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,910
And then I literally gave him the wire transfer info.

245
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,230
And he just, he didn't ask anything.

246
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,390
He was just, okay, it's done.

247
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,670
And I'm like, what the fuck?

248
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,420
I was like, I had to answer so many questions.

249
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:43,900
I was like, because, like, he wasn't asking me about, like, oh, hey, where's the business name and everything.

250
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,720
And then, there's another step, too.

251
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:56,140
I was like, oh, okay, um, I want to, I want to change the address on my account because, like, I don't live there anymore.

252
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,640
And I recently moved.

253
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,440
And then he was like, oh, do you have any personal documents?

254
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,300
And I was like, um, well, I have my bills that, like, my bills, but they're all, like, I can print it.

255
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,280
I have it online.

256
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,260
And he's like, oh, is it, like, oh, you don't have any, like, personal documents, like, physical documents?

257
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,900
I was like...

258
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:23,880
Well, I just moved, but, like, I do have, like, rental agreements and, and, like, uh, the rental agreements and, like, bills I'm paying right now, like, BC Hydro and everything.

259
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,880
But they're all, like, digital, like, on email, either email or, like, um, from the BC Hydro stuff.

260
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:43,080
And then, um, and then he was like, oh, uh, well, we can't, sorry, it has to be, it has to be, like, uh, physical.

261
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,780
And you have to change, so you have to change the address on your, on your ID.

262
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,740
And I was like, what?

263
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,420
But my ID is a different address.

264
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:02,980
I was like, but, but my ID is an address from, like, five plus years ago.

265
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,000
Like, like, it's not even the same address that's registered at the bank.

266
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,280
And then I was like, how is that possible?

267
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,020
The address on my...

268
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,580
My bank account is different from the address on my ID.

269
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,360
But the address I'm changing at my bank account, I want to change it to my newest address.

270
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,660
And he's like, I don't know how that happened.

271
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,000
And I was like, what do you mean you don't know what happened?

272
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,360
Like, that doesn't make sense.

273
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:43,000
Like, I was like, wait, that doesn't make sense.

274
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,680
Anyway, I need to update the address on my ID.

275
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,840
I need to update the address.

276
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,700
I was like, the hell is that open?

277
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,240
Like...

278
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,560
That's my ID.

279
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,880
But yes, I will be updating my ID address.

280
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,960
I never had the time.

281
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,740
I never had the time.

282
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,900
And I got away with it for so long.

283
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,920
I'm just like, this is not a fit.

284
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,420
Anyway.

285
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,140
I fucking hate this guy.

286
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,880
Like, I get him every time.

287
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,080
Like, not every time, but like 80% of the...

288
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:26,120
80% of the time, 80% of the time, like, I'm like always, oh my God.

289
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,880
I'm like, oh, I always get this guy.

290
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,120
And like, he's been so fucking annoying.

291
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:30,700
I...

292
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,040
He doesn't explain things.

293
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,460
He doesn't explain things well.

294
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,060
And like, I had to like walk back several times.

295
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,200
I hate it.

296
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,360
Anyway.

297
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,400
Anyway.

298
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,260
That's over with for life update.

299
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,180
But I also had to do other stuff for errands and everything.

300
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,640
So like, I was so tired yesterday.

301
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,620
I literally was doing errands until 8 p.m.

302
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,480
And then I got home.

303
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,560
Also, like, I'm gonna get a dog trainer next...

304
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,380
And like, either next week or like in the middle of October.

305
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,080
Because...

306
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,340
Because that has been a little shit recently.

307
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,780
And like, I need the dog trainer to tell me what to do.

308
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,740
I need the trainer to tell me what to do.

309
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,120
Okay.

310
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,640
So, so I need, okay.

311
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:41,340
For some reason, he's been very aggressive to like, to like other, uh, to like other dogs.

312
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,840
Um, he's been incredibly like, not like, he doesn't like try to bite them.

313
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,200
Or anything.

314
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:59,240
He was, he's just been like, he's just, whenever he sees another dog, he's just goes like, like, he's really loud by the way, like the other dogs are just minding their own business.

315
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,900
And he gets incredibly aggressive.

316
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,860
And so like, so that's why I'm like, that's one of the reasons why.

317
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,240
Um, that's one of the reasons why.

318
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,060
So like, I'm trying to figure out like how to make sure he doesn't do that anymore.

319
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,620
Cause I'm like, cause, cause I'm just like, please, please.

320
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:26,240
Please, don't, please, I need you to calm down, I need you to calm down.

321
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,800
Um, so like, I'm going to see if I can get the dog trainer to help me with that.

322
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:37,440
And also, yesterday he's been, okay, I think I, now I need to supervise him when I get him toys.

323
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,420
I need to supervise him when I get him toys because, um, I need to buy him, I had to buy him a new dog.

324
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,740
I need, I had to order him a new dog bed today.

325
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:51,960
Which fucking sucks cause I literally got him a new dog bed, um, last week.

326
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,860
I got him a new dog bed last week and, um, I was like so excited cause it was super cute.

327
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:09,780
Like not cute, but it was like super, it seemed super comfy and, uh, and like, and like he could like burrow in it and stuff cause it was like a little, like a burrow bed.

328
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,640
Um, and then I got him a new toy today.

329
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,460
Um, and then I went to sleep.

330
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,520
Cause I, when I was doing errands, I was like, oh, I want to, I want to, you know, grab a little toy for dad.

331
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:27,780
Cause like, I was like, oh yeah, like he could got like, you know, a little present for after a long day out of home, like out of the apartment.

332
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,040
And then, and then I like, I went to take a, take a nap.

333
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,960
I want to take a nap.

334
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,200
I woke up.

335
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,520
Not only did he destroy the fucking toy.

336
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,260
Where there's like fluff.

337
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:57,880
Everywhere on my bed, on my bed, in my bedroom floor, everything I went out cause his bed is like, he's like his dog bed was outside.

338
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,700
I went out and there was fluff everywhere on his dog bed.

339
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,500
And then there was holes everywhere on his dog bed.

340
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,580
And I was like, what the fuck?

341
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,660
It was the first time I saw him.

342
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,820
Absolutely.

343
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,580
Destroyed a dog bed.

344
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,720
Cause there was literally holes everywhere.

345
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:31,520
And I think he got way too excited about destroying his dog toy that he like, he like was like, you're next.

346
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,960
He was like, you're fucking next.

347
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,660
And he went half on the bed as well.

348
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,740
So, so lesson learned.

349
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:51,980
I'm gonna, I need to supervise him when he has a toy so he doesn't fucking destroy his dog bed.

350
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:00,120
No, I did, I was like, I was like, I was like, dad, no, this is bad.

351
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,200
No.

352
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
I even took the stuff.

353
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,080
I was like, what is this?

354
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,240
And then he like sneaked under it and he sneaked under my own bed.

355
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,060
He sneaked under my own bed right after.

356
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,840
I was like, you can't hide from this.

357
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,420
You can't, you can't, why you, you know you fucked up.

358
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,440
He knew what he did.

359
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,880
Like every time, every time he knows he got in trouble or like he knows like, oh no, she's gonna give me a bath or something.

360
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:40,680
He just hides underneath my bed and I can't do anything about it cause he's underneath my bed.

361
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,360
Anyway.

362
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,640
No, it's actually crazy.

363
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,600
Like there's holes underneath the dog bed.

364
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,700
Like how there's holes underneath the dog bed.

365
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,900
There's holes on the side everywhere.

366
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,220
It's literally everywhere.

367
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,660
I am like, I'm, I'm so impressed.

368
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:07,940
I'm like, I'm so impressed that he managed to do that.

369
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,580
I'm like, what happened?

370
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,060
I was just taking a nap!

371
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,620
I was just taking a nap!

372
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,400
Anyway, that's another life update.

373
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,960
Okay, any other life updates?

374
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,800
I wrote some stuff down.

375
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:32,480
Oh yeah, I did yesterday, I know you guys might have seen it already, because I saw people already talking about it.

376
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:41,460
But, yesterday, LMDN me asking me to join an Among Us lobby filled with a lot of people.

377
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:48,320
I told him I can't join exactly at that time, because I was like, I have a stream.

378
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,720
I have a stream today, so I said I'll join.

379
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,580
I'm not gonna rush my stream, I'll join.

380
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,700
But it'll be after my stream's over, and then maybe I'll be there at 3 or 4pm.

381
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,140
That's what I told him, because I was like, I already have commitments.

382
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,740
But like, I know like, oh my gosh, what are the list of people that he gave me?

383
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:30,260
It's LM, Sykuno, Valkyrie, Allermouse, Mysayoshi, Blau, Mii, Huun, Foolish, Chatterbox, Selpid, Ettoz, I don't know who that is.

384
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,420
Janet, and Ludwig.

385
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,700
So like, I said that I'll join later.

386
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,200
Like, when I finish my stream, and I zoned out and like, you know, relax a bit.

387
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,440
And like, you know, relax a bit.

388
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,440
And like, you know, relax a bit.

389
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,440
And like, you know, relax a bit.

390
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,980
And then I'll hop by for a bit.

391
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,520
I won't... I don't know how that... I won't be streaming it.

392
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,940
I won't be streaming it, because I have like another stream at 11pm too.

393
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,660
So, um...

394
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,640
So it's...

395
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,580
Mostly it's gonna be like, where's JokeyBrain?

396
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:56,960
Mostly it's gonna be like, where's JokeyBrain?

397
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:58,980
Mostly it's gonna be like, where's JokeyBrain?

398
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,580
It'll be like, where's CarmenSanDiego?

399
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,420
But where's JokeyBrain?

400
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,720
But where's JokeyBrain?

401
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,060
So yeah.

402
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,340
There's that.

403
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,920
Who is Ettoz?

404
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,880
I actually don't know.

405
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,420
I know everybody here, but...

406
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,140
I don't know who this is.

407
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,000
Oh, he's a YouTuber.

408
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,700
Oh, he's a French YouTuber?

409
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,460
How the fuck did he get in here?

410
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,980
How the fuck did he get in here?

411
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,520
Wait, he IS a French YouTuber.

412
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,960
He's a French streamer.

413
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,640
Oh my god!

414
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,620
Wait, he's pretty big!

415
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,260
I'm sorry for hoo-ing you.

416
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,940
I'm so sorry.

417
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,740
I'm sorry.

418
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,940
Oh, weehoo, weehoo.

419
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,600
I'm sorry.

420
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,720
I didn't know.

421
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,400
I don't follow the French side of YouTube.

422
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,060
Anyway, so yeah there's that.

423
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:57,960
Let's get into it because it is... we've been talking for 30 minutes now... whoops, okay.

424
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,080
Let's put up the game.

425
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,240
I'm super excited to play this game.

426
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,120
I hope the company's not mad at me playing this game because it's definitely not going to be child-friendly.

427
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:20,960
Because I remember in the past when I would ask if I could stream this game and then the company actually replied back in email being like, no.

428
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:38,020
So I mean, now that I'm an indie, obviously we can stream whatever we want now, but I hope they don't stop me.

429
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:48,340
I really hope they don't try and stop me.

430
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,540
That would be embarrassing.

431
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
I'm super excited.

432
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,060
This is actually one of my... wait.

433
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,800
Why is it not... oh there it is.

434
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,060
Oh.

435
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,320
Oh my god, it goes straight in.

436
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,760
I'm sorry!

437
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,460
I'm sorry!

438
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,340
I didn't press it because it starts right away!

439
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,020
I didn't press it because it starts right away!

440
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,120
I didn't press it because it starts right away!

441
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,770
Oh my god, I didn't realize it would start right away.

442
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,730
Holy shit.

443
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,270
Freddy fish in the case of the missing kelp seed.

444
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,210
Alright, there's no sub to... oh it's Puppet!

445
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,490
Jason!

446
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,710
Oh my god, it's the Puppet!

447
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,490
Oh my god.

448
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,870
Puppet goes to the zoo has to be the number one.

449
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,750
My favorite game.

450
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,310
Puppet goes to the zoo.

451
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,650
Let's bring up Freddy.

452
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,190
Okay.

453
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,350
Oh, there's Grandma!

454
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,120
Keep gaming right here.

455
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,120
No!

456
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,790
Not the treasure chest!

457
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:15,630
No!

458
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:16,750
Ow!

459
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,960
He must have seeds in him!

460
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,880
Who steals from Grandmama?

461
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,140
Wait, can I not invite Luther?

462
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,920
He's a little... I don't like him.

463
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,460
...butter and jellyfish sandwich for your journey.

464
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,060
I'll say it right now.

465
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,600
I put in my description, but I hate Luther.

466
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,240
I think I'm a Luther... I'm a proud Luther auntie.

467
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,300
He is nothing but trouble.

468
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,640
No!

469
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,000
Not Luther!

470
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,140
He is nothing but trouble!

471
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,580
All he does is... all he does is cause shit!

472
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,680
And he doesn't help... he doesn't help anybody!

473
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,600
He...

474
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,360
He always gets us in trouble.

475
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,120
Grandmama should not let... let Freddy hang out with Luther.

476
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,680
Like, all he does is cause trouble and...

477
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,300
He's a menace to society!

478
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,960
Anyway, for those who don't know...

479
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,280
Luther is innocent.

480
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,560
So, for those who don't know about...

481
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,440
Freddy Fish, it's like a point-and-click adventure.

482
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,480
And like, this is basically like...

483
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,520
For kids who don't have access to the internet.

484
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,060
Oh, hey!

485
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,740
We have no food?

486
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,820
Wait!

487
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,740
But what about the peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

488
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,580
What about the peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

489
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,680
OH MY GOD!

490
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,200
MY GRANDMA KEEPS THE LAST FOOD IN HER...

491
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,480
IN HER CABINET!

492
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,180
NOW SHE'S GONNA STARVE!

493
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,780
Well, she's already old, so like...

494
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,480
That's fine, I'm a growing fish.

495
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,600
You gotta help her, Toki!

496
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,040
Anyway...

497
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,980
For those who don't know...

498
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,320
Like, the humongous entertainment games...

499
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,740
They're basically like children point-and-click adventures back then.

500
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,440
And like...

501
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,180
You can buy...

502
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,820
I know like, my parents would use to buy them in bulk...

503
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,980
For me...

504
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,660
Um...

505
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,860
At Costco...

506
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,200
Cause that's where all the games are.

507
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,980
That's where all the children games are!

508
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,080
You're either a jumpstart kid...

509
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,520
Or a humongous entertainment kid.

510
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,420
I...

511
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,900
I wrote this in chat...

512
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,400
But jumpstart children...

513
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,080
Jumpstart games are for fucking nerds!

514
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Humongous entertainment games are for gamers!

515
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,620
I played both.

516
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,520
Oh, then you're a nerd and a gamer.

517
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,240
You're a nerd and a gamer.

518
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,340
Because jumpstart games are all about...

519
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,320
Reading!

520
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,580
And math!

521
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,900
And science!

522
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,160
Humongous entertainment is about...

523
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,700
Problem solving!

524
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,480
It's about street smarts!

525
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,140
Not nerd smart!

526
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,040
So...

527
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,680
Um...

528
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,320
But yes...

529
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,440
It was...

530
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:30,720
Um...

531
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,700
They did a lot of them.

532
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,720
There was Spy Fox.

533
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,900
There's Freddy Fish.

534
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,100
There's Putt Putt.

535
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,200
There's Pajama Sam.

536
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,380
I think my fave...

537
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:37,900
I think I...

538
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,760
Um...

539
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,000
I actually like...

540
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,320
I think this is the...

541
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,860
This was the very first...

542
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,340
Uh...

543
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,740
Humongous entertainment game I've ever played.

544
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,600
Um...

545
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:46,860
So...

546
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,000
The Freddy Fish...

547
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And the Search for the Missing Kelp Seeds...

548
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,360
Was the very first...

549
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,740
Uh...

550
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,720
Game I've ever played.

551
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,540
Uh...

552
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,120
For...

553
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,000
Uh...

554
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,700
For...

555
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,080
Uh...

556
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,280
From Humongous Entertainment.

557
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,540
But my favorite ones was...

558
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,240
The...

559
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,740
Putt Putt Goes to the Zoo.

560
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,320
Because I replayed that a lot.

561
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,520
And also...

562
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,400
Pajama Sam.

563
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,540
And the...

564
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
Which one was it?

565
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,960
It's the one where he like...

566
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,600
Was trying to find his like...

567
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,100
Um...

568
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,440
His...

569
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,100
Trying to find his missing comic book.

570
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,780
Oh...

571
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,440
What was it called?

572
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,320
Was it the comic book?

573
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,880
Or the...

574
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,320
The...

575
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:17,980
The bit...

576
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,180
Oh...

577
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,160
Or is that two different ones?

578
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,040
I forgot.

579
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,000
There's two Pajama Sam ones that are really, really good.

580
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,640
But I don't remember the title names.

581
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,360
One where he goes under the bed.

582
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,160
And then he...

583
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,100
Uh...

584
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,560
He has to like...

585
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,280
Find a monster or something.

586
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:31,900
Like...

587
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,400
He has to feed the monster underneath his bed or something.

588
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,960
And then the...

589
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,100
There's the food one.

590
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,420
Yeah.

591
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,720
Yeah.

592
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:37,940
Yeah.

593
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,680
I remember.

594
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,300
Anyway...

595
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,960
Um...

596
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,780
I don't know...

597
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,940
I don't know if like...

598
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,280
I think like Freddy...

599
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,100
I think they're also like different...

600
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,280
Yep.

601
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,620
You can...

602
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,120
There's replayability too.

603
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,660
That's one of the best parts too.

604
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,800
Is that...

605
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,960
A lot of the games they main...

606
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
Has like...

607
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,820
Replayability.

608
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,620
And then...

609
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,120
So like...

610
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,520
There's...

611
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,500
Sometimes they'll have like different mini games.

612
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,280
And different like quest lines.

613
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,200
Um...

614
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,140
But the endings are the...

615
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,120
The endings are the...

616
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,780
Is the same.

617
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,460
But like to get to the ending is different.

618
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,300
I don't know about the first one.

619
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,720
I don't know about Freddy Fish and the Search of the Missing Kelp Seeds.

620
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,700
Is...

621
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,100
Just...

622
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,560
It has like different replay...

623
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,620
It has replayability.

624
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,060
But like...

625
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,560
Um...

626
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,240
I know like...

627
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,980
The...

628
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,380
Pajama Sam one.

629
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,760
And like the...

630
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,000
All that.

631
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,060
There's like...

632
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,540
Um...

633
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,380
It's non-linear.

634
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:23,680
Yeah.

635
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,600
It's non-linear.

636
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:24,720
I don't know what the final version is.

637
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,680
Which was pretty crazy for a children's game.

638
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,020
There was a lot of...

639
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,480
Oh, dude.

640
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,200
Fuck this kid.

641
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,120
Please don't...

642
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,520
Please don't...

643
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,980
Report my stream.

644
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,960
Humongous Entertainment.

645
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,600
I love your games.

646
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,460
I'm a big official...

647
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,180
We're literally in water, Luther!

648
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,180
Don't be stupid!

649
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,900
How can you not loop-de-loop?

650
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,380
Please don't report us!

651
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,270
Oh, no!

652
00:39:59,490 --> 00:39:59,930
Hello!

653
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,010
How are you?

654
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:01,230
I'm not here to play Mario.

655
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,230
I'm here to play Nintendo.

656
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,110
Luther!

657
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,670
This is my grandma's treasure!

658
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,290
Luther, you greedy fuck!

659
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,570
All the fish?!

660
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,090
What do you mean, all the fish?

661
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:30,230
Like, is grandma fucking feeding the entire population in this town?

662
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,410
Where do you have all of my homies?

663
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,310
All the fish are gonna die and we don't find...

664
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,710
Okay, I didn't realize that was the odds here.

665
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,290
We do not need to hear Luther.

666
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,890
No, we do not need to hear.

667
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,590
Hey, Sakuno.

668
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,190
Come on, we gotta find that bottle.

669
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,790
Oh, we're shark bait.

670
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,310
But sharks don't need kelp seed.

671
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,830
I don't understand.

672
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,450
Sharks don't eat kelp?

673
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:20,590
Oh, unless they want to monopolize the kelp seeds so then they can fatten up the other fishies.

674
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,910
So they can, by fattening up, they'll have more food.

675
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,950
So you can, every time you click somewhere, there's like new stuff here.

676
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,910
Cause that's the, there's the blue fish right here.

677
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,330
And then there's, there's another fish right here.

678
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,330
God, I hate Luther.

679
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,130
You're so dumb.

680
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,090
I hate you.

681
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:44,110
I hate you so much.

682
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,270
Why are you Freddy's sidekick?

683
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,790
Freddy deserves so much better.

684
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,550
Freddy, Freddy deserves so much...

685
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,170
Anyway, I brought up the sound a little bit.

686
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,870
Oh, I love all the, it's so pretty too.

687
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,550
Like the animation of the pixel animation and everything.

688
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,990
Like they put so much thought into this.

689
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,090
I wish they made new games.

690
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,110
I really do.

691
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,590
But like, I don't think children would play this.

692
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,990
It'll just be nostalgia bait.

693
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,930
It'll just be, it'll just be nostalgia bait.

694
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,540
Oh no, is your kid stuck?

695
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,340
Don't worry, I've got you man.

696
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,370
Luther, can you do anything right?

697
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:47,870
Is that your son?

698
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,110
Can he not swim out?

699
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,070
Where is he?

700
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,990
Alright, let's find this man's lost child.

701
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,950
Alright, do we get a reward for this?

702
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,490
Guppy, Guppy, Guppy.

703
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,270
Could you please help my Gabby?

704
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,650
Yes, Mrs. Halibut.

705
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,430
Alright, we gotta help the mom.

706
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,090
Hello?

707
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,370
Oh shit.

708
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,470
Wait, I remember this.

709
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,430
I was stuck here because I was such a stupid child.

710
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,530
Please help me.

711
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,230
Alright.

712
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:25,950
Get him out of here.

713
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,850
What are we going to do?

714
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,690
Don't worry Gabby.

715
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,110
We just need to find a bigger board...

716
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,570
to pry the rock off your fin.

717
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,130
Wait, how did you get stuck here?

718
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,190
Why can't we just cut the fin?

719
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,190
It's obviously just a fin that's stuck here, right?

720
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:40,650
Please help me.

721
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,290
He doesn't need that end of the fin.

722
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,430
It grows back, right?

723
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:44,310
I still got it.

724
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,190
It's a red purple.

725
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:46,790
Don't worry Gabby.

726
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,990
We just need to find a bigger board...

727
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,730
to pry the rock off your fin.

728
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,830
Why don't we just cut it?

729
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,550
Just rip the fin off.

730
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,890
Like, it's literally just a purple.

731
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,550
That'll do for it.

732
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,650
Like, he's not going to bleed out if it's just a thin fin, right?

733
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,630
The fin is just like skin.

734
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,270
Right?

735
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,870
Sorry, I don't know fish anatomy.

736
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:16,250
I do not rip the fish's fin back.

737
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,050
Don't be such a baby.

738
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,330
It grows back.

739
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,550
Please help me.

740
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,430
The rock.

741
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,790
Suck.

742
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,450
Don't worry Gabby.

743
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,990
We just need to find a bigger board...

744
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,450
Alright.

745
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,830
We just need to find something to pull him out.

746
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,250
I remember I could never...

747
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,050
I had the hardest time trying to save this child.

748
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:39,230
Because I kept coming back and I was like...

749
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,790
How the fuck do I get this guy out of here?

750
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,430
Oh, hey look.

751
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,150
Jumping seaweed.

752
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:45,810
Yay!

753
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,030
Did you guys see that flip?

754
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,130
Child?

755
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,130
Are you okay Luther?

756
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,750
Did you see the flip?

757
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,430
Did you see the flip?

758
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:54,670
Little kid!

759
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:55,910
Hahaha!

760
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:56,750
Hahaha!

761
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:58,130
Hahaha!

762
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,410
Wasn't that cool?

763
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,250
That was sick!

764
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:04,710
Woah!

765
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:06,630
Gabby's stuck.

766
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,930
But he's okay.

767
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,660
At least he's okay.

768
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,600
Don't worry.

769
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,580
Your child's not dead.

770
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,420
So you'll be fine.

771
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,860
And if he is, you're a fish.

772
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,760
So you can have like a lot of them.

773
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,320
Another treasure map!

774
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,700
What's in it?

775
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,240
The note says...

776
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,920
Go to the deep canyon.

777
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,760
We found another...

778
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,620
A deep canyon?

779
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,660
Where's the deep canyon?

780
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,720
There's so many arrows!

781
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,300
Oh, I found another board!

782
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,380
It's a wooden board.

783
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,920
I can use that to help the child.

784
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,820
Oh, the sea urchin!

785
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,480
That's money!

786
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,040
I remember!

787
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,320
We found a purple sea urchin.

788
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,620
Oh my god!

789
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,360
The sea urchin!

790
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,100
Okay, so sea urchins are money chat.

791
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,120
The beach is up there.

792
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,900
Alright, let's go to the beach.

793
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,140
Luther!

794
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,080
Luther, help!

795
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,620
He did something!

796
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,240
I don't know why you hid all those bottles.

797
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,020
I can't believe they just left the money on the floor like that.

798
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,180
Just sitting there.

799
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,400
Where are you, the kelp treasure?

800
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:17,080
Well, if you can't find that treasure chest, you're gonna have to answer to the squid father.

801
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,180
The squid father?

802
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,880
Not the squid father!

803
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,720
Oh my god, this was...

804
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,860
Finding Nemo stole...

805
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,220
I can't believe Finding Nemo stole from Freddy Fish.

806
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:27,700
Hahahaha!

807
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
I can't believe it!

808
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,220
I can't believe Finding Nemo would do such a thing.

809
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,160
Hello crab.

810
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,100
What's wrong?

811
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,440
Oh me oh my, oh me oh my.

812
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,970
I must get out of this cage.

813
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,010
Please help me get out.

814
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,730
And I'll give you my fishing pole.

815
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,550
Your fishing pole?

816
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:54,910
Wait!

817
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,810
That means you're also eating other fishes.

818
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,890
That means I could be next.

819
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,670
I don't know, maybe we shouldn't save him.

820
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,030
Yeah, why can't I just take the...

821
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:11,610
Wait, you're right.

822
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,310
Why can't I just take the pole?

823
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,190
Yeah, he can't stop me.

824
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,250
He's literally in jail.

825
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,450
Oh, is this a mini-game?

826
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:27,030
Do I win anything from this?

827
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,150
Who's in here?

828
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,150
Okay, okay, I was gonna be like...

829
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,090
Guys, this is where my FPS career started.

830
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,750
I actually don't remember this game.

831
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,230
Please.

832
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,130
What is the fucking hitbox?

833
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:52,750
Okay, it's not me, it's the hitbox, guys.

834
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,650
All three buckets of jellyfish left.

835
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,770
We can leave when the arrow flashes.

836
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:57,890
Let's play again.

837
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,090
Do I actually get anything?

838
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,250
Why can't we eat the jellyfish?

839
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,450
Isn't that also food?

840
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,930
I'm pretty sure, like, you know, we don't need to eat just kelp.

841
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,070
Wait, isn't that kelp right there?

842
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,690
To my right?

843
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,270
Or is that... No, that's kelp.

844
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,350
Yeah, this is kelp right there on the rock.

845
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:21,770
Can't we just harvest that?

846
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,290
Alright, Freddy!

847
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,890
You fed them all!

848
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:29,010
Get ready for some more animals, Freddy!

849
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,870
Can't we just feed... Can't we just harvest this kelp?

850
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,150
Okay, let's...

851
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:35,650
Go get them, Freddy!

852
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:36,710
That's fine.

853
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:37,750
This is so easy.

854
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:40,630
It's like this game is made for children.

855
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,050
Where's the difficulty scaling?

856
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,190
It's dead kelp.

857
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:47,710
It's not the same.

858
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:48,470
Okay.

859
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,610
Stop using logic!

860
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:56,050
All I'm seeing is that this is affecting my immersion right now.

861
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,550
Wait, there's fishes now?

862
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:04,770
See, I told you!

863
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,650
I told you the fish eat dead kelp!

864
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,790
I told you!

865
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,910
What do you mean the fishes are gonna starve?

866
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,990
These fishes are clearly fine!

867
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,230
They're...

868
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,950
They don't need grandma's kelp!

869
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:21,470
Alright, Freddy!

870
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,410
You have all three buckets of jellyfish left!

871
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:26,570
Let's play again, Freddy!

872
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,530
Fish don't buy everything.

873
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,750
You're a higher class fish.

874
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,330
Oh yeah, sorry.

875
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,710
This is like...

876
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:39,730
Those fishes are not the upper class.

877
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:45,150
These are the middle class and below fishies.

878
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:49,490
They don't deserve the kelp that me and Luther have.

879
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:49,970
Freddy!

880
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,950
There's a jellyfish left!

881
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,970
They're wild fish.

882
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,690
Freddy, it looks like the fish are hungry too.

883
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,230
Well, they're still...

884
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,490
The commoners are approaching.

885
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,750
Let me see if we can get to a hundred.

886
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,050
Alright, let's see.

887
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:09,770
Infinite ammo.

888
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:11,810
I don't understand.

889
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,930
Like, what happens to my bucket if they get close?

890
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,370
Do they just raid the buckets?

891
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,590
More points than others.

892
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:22,470
This is like those, like, videos where we are taking advantage of, like...

893
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,290
You know those, like, YouTubers?

894
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,290
TikTokers?

895
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:28,130
That take advantage of the homeless people for, like, uh...

896
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,710
For, like, content?

897
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,290
This is me and I put, like, three buckets of, like...

898
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,630
Three... Like, I'm just throwing food at them.

899
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,450
Am I a bad fish?

900
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:38,690
Am I...

901
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,410
Oh my god, am I...

902
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,490
Am I a bad fish?

903
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,570
Am I...

904
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,070
Monetizing their...

905
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:50,770
Their misfortune?

906
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:52,790
Am I Mr. B?

907
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,230
No, we're not there yet.

908
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:57,250
We're not there.

909
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,510
When I become a...

910
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:01,530
Maybe a millionaire, then maybe I can be Mr. Beast.

911
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,230
You fed them all!

912
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,670
Let's play again, Freddy!

913
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:04,770
I fed them all!

914
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,430
Watch out for the zigzagging octopuses!

915
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:08,970
Wait, is there octopus now?

916
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:10,870
Wait, how long does this go?

917
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:11,910
How many do they have?

918
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,070
Oh, they zigzag now.

919
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,990
Mr. Doki.

920
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,510
Guys, did you hear about the newest...

921
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:22,810
It's crazy.

922
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,270
And, like, within, like, two... four months...

923
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:33,790
Like, 2024 has been the fucking craziest year for, like, streamer downfalls.

924
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:40,210
Like, there's so many streamers that fell from grace within 2024.

925
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,310
It's actually crazy.

926
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,700
Wait, is there more than just the octopi?

927
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,360
Wait, what happened now?

928
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,080
Well...

929
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,220
There was the Moon Moon thing.

930
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,720
And then there's, like, Mr. Beast.

931
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,080
And then there's, like, uh...

932
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,040
You know...

933
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,240
The Moon Moon thing was fucking crazy.

934
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,510
I'm like, no!

935
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,190
That's too close!

936
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,410
I'm like, no!

937
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,270
That's too...

938
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,230
Oh,

939
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,370
no!

940
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,590
Yeah, that shit was insane.

941
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:27,350
When...

942
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,790
Because, like, Moon Moon has been a content creator for, like...

943
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:31,550
He was a...

944
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,330
I remember Moon Moon when he was Moon Moon underscore O-W.

945
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,630
So that shit was insane.

946
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:40,570
When I...

947
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:41,670
When I read the...

948
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,330
When I read the...

949
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,790
The logs or...

950
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:45,530
I read the logs.

951
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,010
I...

952
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,270
I couldn't fin...

953
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,690
I couldn't finish reading the logs.

954
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:49,630
It was...

955
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,190
It was...

956
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:51,930
It was...

957
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:54,050
It was...

958
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:54,910
It was too much.

959
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:55,450
I was...

960
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,830
I was like...

961
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,110
Oh, my God.

962
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:58,910
Wait, the fish is...

963
00:52:58,910 --> 00:52:59,710
Holy shit!

964
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,270
He's so fast!

965
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,050
He's so hungry!

966
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:02,710
He's...

967
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,770
Oh, my God!

968
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,150
He's so fucking hungry!

969
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,790
They are wild.

970
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,090
They are fucking wild.

971
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,090
Anyway...

972
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:16,130
The newest Mr. Beast thing is that apparently he's blacklisted from Las Vegas or something.

973
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:20,830
Because he's trying to do this reality show that's like the Squid Game.

974
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,010
And then apparently the working conditions for...

975
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:30,590
The working conditions for it was so bad that, like, they had...

976
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,530
They blacklisted Mr. Beast from ever working with them.

977
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:34,710
But, yeah!

978
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,330
Yeah.

979
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:46,110
Apparently, like, contestants were literally, like, having to go to the hospital and everything.

980
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:47,190
Anyway.

981
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,110
We'll let this crab die.

982
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:49,850
I guess.

983
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:51,850
Where do I go?

984
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:52,910
Which one is which?

985
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,350
There's no signs anywhere.

986
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:58,010
When this happened, I found out, like, this week about it.

987
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,250
Both of those things.

988
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:01,530
Oh, yeah.

989
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:03,570
And then the Lunchables shit was funny, too.

990
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,550
Well, it's not funny.

991
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:05,790
But...

992
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:07,590
Don't worry.

993
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,930
I will definitely help Gabby.

994
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,190
Even though he looks like...

995
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:13,390
Even though he looks like Luther, I will help him.

996
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,330
Oh, yeah.

997
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:15,670
The...

998
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,030
What was it called?

999
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:16,150
What?

1000
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,370
The Lunchly or whatever.

1001
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:17,990
Oh, hey!

1002
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,330
Oh, is that key for the crab?

1003
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,620
The fact that they're, like, it's...

1004
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,280
It's healthier than Lunchables.

1005
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,200
But then...

1006
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:36,200
You can't get through the shrimp net unless you got the super duper duka buka poly gizmo.

1007
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,400
The super duper poly gizmo?

1008
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,720
You can't get the super duper duka buka poly gizmo.

1009
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,320
Luther, you can literally fizz through it!

1010
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,640
You give me a clock.

1011
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,680
Why do you want a clock?

1012
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,380
Is he flashing me?

1013
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,560
Look in the junkyard.

1014
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,120
Luther!

1015
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,520
This is your one time to redeem yourself.

1016
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,400
Luther, this is literally your one time to redeem yourself.

1017
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,460
Luther, you fit in the hole!

1018
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,280
Luther, you literally fit in the hole!

1019
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,500
Please, do anything!

1020
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,220
Nice clock.

1021
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,060
This sounds like a scav.

1022
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,540
Okay, I got the key.

1023
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,880
Alright, sir.

1024
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,560
I got the key.

1025
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,680
I need your fishing pole.

1026
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,660
I'll get you out of the cage, fiddler crab!

1027
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,880
Are you surprised this jellyfish game was Luther's idea?

1028
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,780
Zane, thank you for the super chat!

1029
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,220
Thank you!

1030
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:31,960
Thank you!

1031
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,040
Get her down!

1032
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,540
Thank you for the super chat!

1033
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:34,840
Thank you!

1034
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,480
Thank you!

1035
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,480
Alright, give me your fishing pole.

1036
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,940
Bro, just throw it!

1037
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,820
You don't need it.

1038
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,540
Bro, if you throw it, what's closer?

1039
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:46,820
Lucy.

1040
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,800
Thank you, Mr. Crab.

1041
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,360
Yay!

1042
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,800
I could have stolen it.

1043
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:01,380
I could have literally stole the... Oh no, I don't want to play this game anymore.

1044
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,800
No, I didn't mean to!

1045
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,020
I didn't mean to!

1046
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,940
It was so close!

1047
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,040
Lucy, get me out of here!

1048
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,160
Is he giving the chat?

1049
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:11,860
No!

1050
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,200
No!

1051
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,300
Okay, I'm gonna... Alright, go eat my bucket.

1052
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,200
999.

1053
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,900
It's like giving a chat.

1054
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,140
Oh, he is!

1055
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,200
Oh my god, please, I can't leave!

1056
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,420
I have to wait for them to eat the bucket!

1057
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,740
But yeah, it's actually crazy how within four months, like...

1058
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,920
I think, like, literally he released a video.

1059
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:51,120
Four months ago, or three months ago, where he had, like, so many YouTubers and streamers from Twitch and YouTube participating in, like, the streamer games.

1060
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:54,560
And then, literally, like, the fall from grace.

1061
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,520
It's actually crazy.

1062
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,980
And also, like, the Lunchable Lunchly stuff was, like...

1063
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,220
Because I'm like, how is Prime healthier than Capri Sun?

1064
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,360
Like,

1065
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,620
I couldn't, like...

1066
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,840
Okay, you can just... You can try it.

1067
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:11,840
You can try it.

1068
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:11,840
You can try it.

1069
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:11,840
You can try it.

1070
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:11,840
You can try it.

1071
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:11,840
You can try it.

1072
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,900
I'm trying to say, like, okay, it's almost similar to Lunchables, like the crackers or whatever.

1073
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,440
But then, I'm just like, how is Prime, like...

1074
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,120
I don't feel like Prime is healthier than Capri Sun.

1075
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,900
Isn't Prime, like, filled with, like, sugar?

1076
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,440
Like, you can argue about everything else, but, like...

1077
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,680
Oh, hey, let's go... Let's go explore a dead...

1078
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,940
Let's go to a fish cemetery, Luther.

1079
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,940
That'd be so cool.

1080
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,300
Oh, and harvest the bone!

1081
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,500
Let's fucking go!

1082
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,620
Go, Freddy!

1083
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,140
Go!

1084
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,220
The electrolyte.

1085
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,760
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure Prime has, like, lots of sugar.

1086
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,160
Alright, let's go.

1087
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:05,840
Let's leave now.

1088
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,560
Yay, Luther!

1089
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:08,860
Let's play in the cemetery!

1090
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,760
And brave rob somebody's remains!

1091
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:12,940
Let's go!

1092
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,740
Yeah, it's an energy drink for children.

1093
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,760
Which I don't think it's really that healthy.

1094
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,720
I think it's sugar- There's no way Prime is sugar-free.

1095
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,640
Don't- I'm gonna Google that right now.

1096
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,900
I'm just thinking, there's no way.

1097
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,480
Is Prime sugar-free?

1098
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,200
There's no way.

1099
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,160
There's no added sugar in Prime?

1100
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,400
What makes it so sweet?

1101
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,840
Oh, artificial sweeteners.

1102
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,860
Oh, isn't that worse?

1103
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:53,120
Isn't- Isn't artificial sweetener worse?

1104
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,460
I think I- we're confusing the term healthy with less terrible.

1105
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,160
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

1106
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,500
Thank you, thank you.

1107
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:14,820
Okay, so it's sucralose and inosito and something potassium.

1108
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,280
I have no idea what that is.

1109
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,420
I can't believe it's sugar-free.

1110
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,960
But I feel like...

1111
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:25,560
I feel like artificial sweeteners may not be as safe- Okay.

1112
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:31,780
Okay.

1113
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,220
I love how- Okay.

1114
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,740
I like how- I like how this one was like, it's not as- It may not be a safe alternative.

1115
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,700
Especially for kids.

1116
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,280
Holy fuck!

1117
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,640
Okay.

1118
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,020
That caught me off guard.

1119
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,080
That caught me off guard.

1120
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,800
No way.

1121
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:00,820
No way.

1122
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,560
Oh my god.

1123
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:07,620
Okay.

1124
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,480
Um.

1125
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,820
Okay, let's- let's- Let's go back to Freddy Fish.

1126
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,500
Alright.

1127
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,540
Here you go.

1128
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,560
It's time to save you.

1129
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,740
So your mom can- Please help me.

1130
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,140
So your mom can reward me with some money.

1131
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,720
Ling, thank you for the super chat.

1132
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,640
Thank you, thank you.

1133
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,500
Toki, I'm kind of feeling happy today.

1134
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,760
And it's because I see you streaming today.

1135
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:29,860
Okay.

1136
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,660
Thank you, my super chat.

1137
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,560
Thank you, thank you.

1138
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:32,720
Yay!

1139
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:33,180
Yay!

1140
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,280
We saved the fish!

1141
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,200
Mommy!

1142
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:38,860
Gabby!

1143
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,360
My Gabby!

1144
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,760
Thank you both.

1145
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,620
You're welcome, Mr. Halibut.

1146
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:44,720
Of course.

1147
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,880
Mrs. Halibut.

1148
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,100
Please, this is the urgency urgent for saving my Gabby.

1149
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:49,640
Yay!

1150
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,760
We're rich!

1151
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,020
Hey, Mrs. Halibut.

1152
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,820
Wait, you said some.

1153
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,680
You gave me one.

1154
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,860
Hey, I think you miscounted.

1155
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,680
You said some.

1156
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,860
But you gave me one!

1157
01:00:59,040 --> 01:00:59,300
You gave me one!

1158
01:00:59,300 --> 01:00:59,400
You gave me one!

1159
01:00:59,400 --> 01:00:59,440
You gave me one!

1160
01:00:59,440 --> 01:00:59,740
You gave me one!

1161
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:17,820
I remember as a child, because I was so stupid and didn't use my problem-solving skills, my game plan going into, like, because, like, when I first started playing these games, my game plan going into these games was just click everything until something happens.

1162
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:23,960
I would click everything because I had no problem-solving skills whatsoever as a child growing up.

1163
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:29,640
I still don't, but, like, now that I've chat to problem-solve for me, like, it's a lot easier now.

1164
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,620
It's a lot easier.

1165
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,080
Yeah, keep clicking until something works.

1166
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,880
Oh, I have... I got you something!

1167
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,000
I wish I could get some sleep, Freddy.

1168
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,780
But this shell, it glows all day.

1169
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,320
It glows all night.

1170
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,480
Oh, no!

1171
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,940
I wish I could brave it for a shell that doesn't glow.

1172
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,600
Oh, my God!

1173
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:59,820
You know, this game was made in the 90s because, like, he's not using a can for a shell.

1174
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,300
The pollution hasn't hit yet.

1175
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,520
Hi, Herman.

1176
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,100
You look pretty.

1177
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,540
I wish I could get some sleep, Freddy.

1178
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,420
But this shell, it glows all day.

1179
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,960
It glows all night.

1180
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,620
I wish I could brave it for a shell that doesn't glow.

1181
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:16,880
Well, ain't you in luck, Mr. Crab.

1182
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,140
Second Crab.

1183
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,980
I got you a shell that doesn't glow!

1184
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,600
I got you a new shell that doesn't glow.

1185
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,660
The Radioactive Crab.

1186
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,900
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy!

1187
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,380
It's wonderful!

1188
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,000
It's okay.

1189
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,720
Back then, we thought radiation was really funny.

1190
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,720
And doesn't cause, like, cancer.

1191
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,000
Hey, you can use this glowing shell!

1192
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:38,860
Thank you, Freddy!

1193
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:39,500
But now we know.

1194
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:40,980
Now we know.

1195
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:41,780
Good night.

1196
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,220
Good night!

1197
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,220
We should hurry up and find the kelp treasure!

1198
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,380
Yay!

1199
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,180
We got a radioactive shell!

1200
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,360
The funny... Oh my god, he's gonna have superpowers now!

1201
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,020
Wait, who's here?

1202
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,020
Welcome to King Crab's Castle!

1203
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,720
There's so many crabs in this fish universe!

1204
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,020
Radiation makes superheroes!

1205
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,180
Oh yeah, you asked about the fire alarm earlier!

1206
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,620
Yeah, it was a fire alarm test.

1207
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,120
I just didn't know how long it was gonna go.

1208
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,140
So that's why, like, I stopped the stream.

1209
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:22,000
Because I was like, okay, it would be weird if it keeps going on for, like, 30 more minutes.

1210
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,880
While I pull cards.

1211
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,840
And people would be like, why the fuck are you pulling cards when you...

1212
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,160
I didn't go downstairs, by the way.

1213
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,600
I just... I... I just stayed...

1214
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,140
I just stayed in my apartment while the fire alarm kept going.

1215
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,720
I was like, it'll stop eventually, right?

1216
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,180
Cause I looked outside, there was no fire trucks.

1217
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,000
I didn't see, like, people downstairs.

1218
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,920
So then I was like, okay, so, like, it has to be a false alarm.

1219
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,800
Guys, I'm not... I'm...

1220
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,060
Guys, I might... I might have a...

1221
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,080
I might be fucked in life.

1222
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,460
Wait, you know me?

1223
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,220
Oh my god, you know me?

1224
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:06,040
Am I famous?

1225
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,360
Of course, I'm upper... upper class here in the fish universe.

1226
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,440
What happened?

1227
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:29,200
Wait, are we all depending on my grandma's food supply for the entire population?

1228
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,500
I think that's not very kingly of you.

1229
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,320
Like, I...

1230
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,280
Oh my god, it's his mistress right here.

1231
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,200
Did you see that?

1232
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,440
Oh my god, his mistress is right there.

1233
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,860
Mr. King, I don't think we should be relying on my grandma to... to fund the entire...

1234
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,120
food supply of your kingdom.

1235
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,020
No wonder I'm famous.

1236
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:00,480
I'm literally, like, holding on to, like, this population's...

1237
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,300
the population's life or death situation right here.

1238
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,580
Grandma is the unauthorized cup supplier.

1239
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,760
Only grandmama can supply the food.

1240
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,460
Nobody else!

1241
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,980
The potato famine!

1242
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,600
And thus, I was responsible for the potato famine.

1243
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,620
Alright, we go this way.

1244
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:24,620
This way.

1245
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,220
And then...

1246
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,560
Oh yeah, that's where the king is.

1247
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:29,540
You can see the crown.

1248
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,680
Alright, before we go, I need to use the bathroom.

1249
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,660
I'll be right back, chat.

1250
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,320
Oh wait, there's more money here!

1251
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,200
Wait, let me grab the money.

1252
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,720
This is much more important than the bathroom.

1253
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,380
Money is more important than using the bathroom right now.

1254
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:43,340
Alright.

1255
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,140
We're going this way.

1256
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:46,940
I'll be right back, chat.

1257
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:47,880
Wait, no!

1258
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,600
Wait, I think there's a club nearby.

1259
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,840
If I remember correctly, there should be a club.

1260
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,560
We could go watch the club while I use the bathroom.

1261
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,140
There has to be a club right here, right?

1262
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:58,560
No.

1263
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,360
God damn it!

1264
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,840
Alright, you guys see the pit.

1265
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,460
I'll be right back.

1266
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,220
I'm back.

1267
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,120
Dad tried to break in my room because he knew there was food inside.

1268
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:58,660
Uh...

1269
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,000
He knew there was food inside.

1270
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,400
And the moment I came out of the room, he tried to rush in.

1271
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,400
He's like, it's time!

1272
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,700
He's like, this is it!

1273
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,460
I can go in now!

1274
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,240
I thought that you guys...

1275
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:15,720
Oh, I thought that...

1276
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,920
I'm gonna head over here first.

1277
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,620
Alright, we're gonna go here.

1278
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,820
He took his shot!

1279
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,160
Oh, another sea urchin!

1280
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,260
Yay!

1281
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:28,520
More money!

1282
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,000
I can't believe they would just leave money on the floor like that!

1283
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,860
Hello, little starfish!

1284
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,080
Hello, Mr. Starfish!

1285
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:40,660
Class?

1286
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:42,880
What?

1287
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,640
You know what?

1288
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,600
It can't be that difficult.

1289
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,520
Like, this is a game for children.

1290
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,980
But also, why am I getting taught right now?

1291
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,700
Like, I didn't consent to being in this class.

1292
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,400
Oh, that's so easy!

1293
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:09,420
Three...

1294
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:10,940
Twenty-three!

1295
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:13,900
Look at that.

1296
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,460
Quick maths.

1297
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,980
Do I win anything?

1298
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,200
Teacher, where's my positive enforcement?

1299
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,860
Sixty...

1300
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:23,420
Four.

1301
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:25,980
Yay!

1302
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,280
What is the sum of...

1303
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,180
90, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

1304
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,060
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

1305
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,940
5, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

1306
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,360
95!

1307
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:45,220
95!

1308
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,760
Very good!

1309
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:47,360
Yay!

1310
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,600
Guys, in my head, I cannot do 8 plus 7.

1311
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,520
I don't...

1312
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,300
I don't know what...

1313
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,620
Oh, it's 20!

1314
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,760
It has to be 20-something!

1315
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,680
So it has to be 22!

1316
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,220
I can't...

1317
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:04,180
I can't...

1318
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:06,140
I don't know what 8 plus 7 is!

1319
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,140
Oh, 63.

1320
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:11,860
Okay, how is that advanced?

1321
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,360
What is 64 minus what?

1322
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,540
Okay, if that is advanced...

1323
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,720
What is...

1324
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,720
79.

1325
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,220
If this is advanced, what is easy?

1326
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,660
What the fuck is easy?

1327
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,600
Minus 1 is in your pants.

1328
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,160
2...

1329
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,560
This is 5...

1330
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,440
4...

1331
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,060
5...

1332
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:41,820
1...

1333
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,240
4...

1334
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:42,780
4...

1335
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:43,780
4...

1336
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,180
3...

1337
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:44,580
It's...

1338
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:44,940
4...

1339
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,060
5...

1340
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,440
15...

1341
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,700
Minus...

1342
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,620
7...

1343
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:53,580
14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9...

1344
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,400
8...

1345
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,100
It's 28!

1346
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:55,960
28!

1347
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,340
You're right!

1348
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,220
Yay!

1349
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:58,480
Yay!

1350
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,540
We've answered 7 questions right.

1351
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,460
We did it!

1352
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,520
Okay, I'm stopping.

1353
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,200
I don't think he's gonna stop.

1354
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,000
I did it!

1355
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,060
Wait, I wonder how easy is easy?

1356
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,800
How easy is easy?

1357
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,640
I'm Mr. Starfish.

1358
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,520
Your math teacher for today.

1359
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:23,880
Welcome to class.

1360
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,040
Guys, now you guys can tell why I almost failed math.

1361
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,240
How many seahorses do you see?

1362
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,160
3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12.

1363
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,360
Oh, he just count.

1364
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,520
That's easy.

1365
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,420
So like, we don't even get numbers.

1366
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,260
You just learn how to count.

1367
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,600
Another problem.

1368
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,920
Is it just seahorses?

1369
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,020
How many fish are there?

1370
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,280
4, 5, 6, 7...

1371
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:50,460
Okay.

1372
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,880
All right, so easy is literally just counting seahorses.

1373
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,440
Wait, then what about...

1374
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,020
What about North Sea Seahorses?

1375
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:02,080
Four.

1376
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:02,500
This is hard.

1377
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:04,820
Doki, I'm blind.

1378
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,180
Of course this is hard.

1379
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,180
How hard do you want...

1380
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:10,500
How...

1381
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,340
What's medium then?

1382
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,140
Some medium.

1383
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,680
Is medium only single digits?

1384
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,620
What is the difference between...

1385
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,100
Wait, this is so much harder.

1386
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,740
Oh no, this is four.

1387
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:19,180
Four.

1388
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,220
Very good.

1389
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:23,680
This is visual learning and I've got very good at the visual part.

1390
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,640
What is the difference between...

1391
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,680
Okay, nevermind.

1392
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,520
This is a lot easier.

1393
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,520
I can't believe I don't get rewarded.

1394
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,260
I don't get rewarded for this.

1395
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,080
Where are my stars?

1396
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,860
Where are my golden stars?

1397
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,820
Guys, I need my immersion.

1398
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:52,520
Can you give me gold stars for a good job well done?

1399
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,280
Thank you for the super chat.

1400
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,100
Thank you, thank you.

1401
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:00,720
Imagine if Doki Bird plays Winnie the Pooh Home Run Derby, a kid's game.

1402
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:08,100
More like hell in the form of baseball, especially when facing the torturous nightmares that are Tigger or Christopher Robin.

1403
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,740
Oh yeah, I heard about that game.

1404
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:14,720
I heard that it's like incredibly difficult for the baseball part.

1405
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:15,720
Thank you for the super chat.

1406
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,440
Thank you, thank you.

1407
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,680
You know what I'm excited about?

1408
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,240
I'm excited about the Backyard...

1409
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:20,740
What was it?

1410
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:21,800
The Backyard Baseball?

1411
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,420
Or Backyard Soccer?

1412
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,100
Or Backyard Basketball?

1413
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:29,820
That game was so fucking fun, and I think it's harder than the Home Run Derby.

1414
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,560
Oh, I have a bone!

1415
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:42,130
You want this little bone?

1416
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:43,210
That's right!

1417
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:45,810
It's your dead, dead mom.

1418
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,890
He's basically Cubone now.

1419
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:55,370
He's basically Cubone!

1420
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,010
I mean, could be.

1421
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,870
Holy shit, what the fuck is that?

1422
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:00,970
He could literally be his dead...

1423
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:01,610
It's dead mom.

1424
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:02,590
We found it in the graveyard.

1425
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,170
We grave robbed it.

1426
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:07,870
Shoutouts to Cuba!

1427
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:09,050
Oh!

1428
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:12,790
Nice cock!

1429
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:14,250
Clock!

1430
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:16,330
Nice clock!

1431
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:17,570
That's what I meant.

1432
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:18,130
I'm PG.

1433
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:19,790
Oh, there's a frog here.

1434
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:26,330
There's some kelp.

1435
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:28,410
We should be harvesting kelp while we're doing this.

1436
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:32,990
You know what I miss?

1437
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:33,750
Okay.

1438
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:43,210
The one thing I miss about Japan, or like Asia in general, living in Asia, is the konbinis.

1439
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:45,450
Or like the 7-Elevens.

1440
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:51,930
Because like, the food you can get at the markets and everything.

1441
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:59,110
And the one thing I miss the most is the egg sandwiches.

1442
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:01,310
The egg sand...

1443
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:02,470
Oh, it just doesn't...

1444
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:06,030
I've been trying to chase the egg sandwich high in Canada.

1445
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:08,510
But it's just... it doesn't... it's not the same.

1446
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:10,830
It's not the same!

1447
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:13,450
I got it!

1448
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:14,450
Thank you for the super chat!

1449
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:15,530
Thank you, thank you!

1450
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:18,090
It's just not the same.

1451
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:22,510
The egg sandwiches just doesn't taste like the egg sandwiches in Japan!

1452
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,170
Oh, so that's why...

1453
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,930
I didn't say no!

1454
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:30,890
What?

1455
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,690
It's a really nice clock!

1456
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:34,650
Look at it!

1457
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:36,270
It has numbers and everything!

1458
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:42,650
Hello, would you like... would you like a clock?

1459
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:44,110
A clock!

1460
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:50,930
You're welcome for the clock!

1461
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,210
You're welcome!

1462
01:16:58,170 --> 01:16:59,450
Nice doing business with you!

1463
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:03,150
I got it, guys.

1464
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:04,410
I got the clock.

1465
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:06,670
By the way, I'm eating an egg sandwich right now.

1466
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,510
That's what I'm talking about!

1467
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:09,790
Egg sandwiches!

1468
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:15,430
He said it was a great clock.

1469
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:17,790
To tell time.

1470
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,170
That's what clocks are for.

1471
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:24,930
Alright, let us...

1472
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,470
I think we have to go back there.

1473
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,790
I wonder if this is a game where we get to go to the club.

1474
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:33,510
It's like the club in one of the Freddy Fish games.

1475
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:34,930
And then you get like free entertainment.

1476
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:38,310
Alright.

1477
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,850
I don't think I finished...

1478
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:42,390
Oh yeah, did I finish this part yet?

1479
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:43,330
I think I did.

1480
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:43,750
Yeah, I did.

1481
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:44,030
I did.

1482
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:45,010
So we're going to the pit.

1483
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:47,130
To the pit!

1484
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:48,990
Where Bane was born!

1485
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,380
Clocks over time?

1486
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,260
That's true.

1487
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:59,200
I used to wear watches all the time.

1488
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,060
At school.

1489
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:04,480
But ever since the iPhone came out, there was no use for watches anymore.

1490
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,260
Luther, you fucking idiot!

1491
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,100
Why do we ever let him do anything?

1492
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,700
This is why I say it.

1493
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,180
Freddy Fish needs better friends.

1494
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,440
Freddy needs better friends.

1495
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,460
If I was Freddy's mom right now, I would make sure he...

1496
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,820
Oh, you're one of those moms.

1497
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:30,080
It sure is scary down there.

1498
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,600
Luther, my mom said we can't hang out anymore.

1499
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,960
She says you're a very bad influence.

1500
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,320
And I'm right!

1501
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:41,180
This place is scary.

1502
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,140
And I'm fucking right.

1503
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,120
You are a bad influence.

1504
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,020
I'm not the bottom.

1505
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:51,700
I

1506
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,100
have the glow-in-the-dark thing!

1507
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,040
He must like it.

1508
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,080
It's a glowing shell.

1509
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,740
It's a glowing shell.

1510
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:03,720
Yes, I know it's a glowing...

1511
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:04,600
Oh wait, maybe a fish?

1512
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,500
Maybe like I'll fish him out and then we kill him?

1513
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,760
I fucking knew it!

1514
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:13,760
Problem solving!

1515
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,980
Oh my god, it's like this is a game for children.

1516
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,380
I honestly, legitimately thought that we were gonna kill the fish.

1517
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,900
We're gonna fish that fish out.

1518
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,280
And then just chuck him out into the sky.

1519
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,680
Into the beach so it dehydrates and dies.

1520
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,900
It's literally self-defense!

1521
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,400
He started it!

1522
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,440
We're getting closer to the kelp treasure!

1523
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,080
Yay!

1524
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,920
Not the squid father?

1525
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,940
Oh, clam up, sponge head!

1526
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,960
You lost the treasure, so now you got to see the squid father!

1527
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,240
Oh, please, boss!

1528
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,560
Not the squid father!

1529
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:02,980
The squid father!

1530
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:03,560
That's right!

1531
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,780
You messed up!

1532
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,960
Did you guys know sharks and squids are Italian?

1533
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,480
All sharks and squids?

1534
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,760
Alright, where do we go?

1535
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:14,880
I guess we go here.

1536
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:15,640
There's holes there.

1537
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:18,760
Yeah.

1538
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,160
Back then in the 90s, everything was a Godfather reference.

1539
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:22,740
Whoa!

1540
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,640
The three caves!

1541
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:26,900
Whoa!

1542
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:29,820
Now no one gets past Eddie the eel.

1543
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,080
Why not?

1544
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,020
But we're looking for Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure.

1545
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:37,960
If we don't find it soon, all the fish are going to die.

1546
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,020
Yeah, and their blood is going to be on your hands.

1547
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:44,940
Look kids, why don't you just get out of here before I have to eat you?

1548
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:45,840
What?

1549
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:53,360
But like, if all of us dies, you won't have anything to eat anymore.

1550
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,440
What if I pay you?

1551
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,660
And Urchin, if you want past me...

1552
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:59,140
You're going to have to give me something better to eat.

1553
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,480
You want my only sandwich?

1554
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,800
That my grandma made?

1555
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:09,400
With the remains of all the fish population food?

1556
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:14,540
And if I give you this sandwich, I wouldn't be able to eat today?

1557
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,620
Give it.

1558
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,560
Yes, I starve.

1559
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:22,480
Yum!

1560
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,100
Grandma Grouper's famous peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich.

1561
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,240
I guess I could let you pass.

1562
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,340
Good luck finding Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure.

1563
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,880
Oh, now, okay.

1564
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,140
He's like, good luck.

1565
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,920
Maybe now you won't starve if you do find it.

1566
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,310
That's funny.

1567
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:45,010
He's like, all right.

1568
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:48,550
Well, now that I'm fed, I hope you guys get food later.

1569
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,750
All right, we'll go this way.

1570
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:52,770
Oh yeah, I think this is a labyrinth or something.

1571
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:53,550
Oh, I have the glowing...

1572
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,330
That's right.

1573
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:58,130
First try!

1574
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:04,430
The clue says the treasure is hidden in the sunken ship.

1575
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,850
A sunken ship?

1576
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:07,870
We will get the kelp seeds at the old ship.

1577
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:08,770
I know.

1578
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:09,550
You're right.

1579
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:11,970
Why didn't we just feed him looser?

1580
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:19,330
Oh, hey, there's the catfish.

1581
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:21,150
The crab!

1582
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:25,690
I thought I put the first bottle at the nexus.

1583
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:30,810
But the squid father...

1584
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:33,470
Or was the first bottle at the canyon?

1585
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:35,890
Come on, sponge head.

1586
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:37,750
There's dead fish next to him.

1587
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:41,810
The squid father trusted us to hide the stolen kelp treasure for him.

1588
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:43,710
Wait, why the fuck does he need kelp treasure?

1589
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:47,370
He literally doesn't even eat...

1590
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,510
He's not even a vegetarian.

1591
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:54,510
I remember where the treasure is.

1592
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:00,410
Come on, sponge head.

1593
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:02,950
Wait, where is the treasure?

1594
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,790
Oh, it's the sunken...

1595
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:04,850
It's in the sunken ship.

1596
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:05,830
Wait, did we...

1597
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:07,670
Did we just skip?

1598
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:09,850
I didn't finish exploring!

1599
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:11,550
What treasure should be?

1600
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,390
Aye, matey.

1601
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:15,830
That old shipwreck has held...

1602
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:16,730
How did we get here?

1603
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:18,830
...so many treasures over so many years.

1604
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,770
We're looking for grandma.

1605
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:24,230
Good luck, mates.

1606
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:27,310
Wait, I can't leave.

1607
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:30,170
No, I didn't finish exploring!

1608
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:34,130
No!

1609
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:37,510
That old ship sailed through hurricanes.

1610
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:39,430
I passed the point.

1611
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:42,190
But I have five dollars!

1612
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:47,270
I have five purple seers.

1613
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,590
I have five dollars!

1614
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,250
I didn't use my money!

1615
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,090
I didn't use my money!

1616
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:56,050
I didn't use my money!

1617
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:56,870
Wait, this was when I was a kid.

1618
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:59,750
It took me an hour to complete the sunken ship.

1619
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:03,070
I remember actually crying at one point.

1620
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:09,470
It's like I would cry too if I had to be stuck in the game for an hour.

1621
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:11,830
Stuck at this point for an hour.

1622
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:15,550
Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure is for everyone to share.

1623
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:22,700
And besides, the window is closed and it's much too heavy for the crank.

1624
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,300
We could crank open the window...

1625
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,580
I can't believe it!

1626
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,640
What am I going to do with my five dollars?

1627
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:36,920
What?

1628
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,660
Look, Luther.

1629
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:42,580
Grandma Grouper's...

1630
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,440
Oh, you can pause?

1631
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,820
Game pause.

1632
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,140
Okay, I can skip with escape.

1633
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,780
Thank God.

1634
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,860
I was going to be like, please, I don't want to listen to Luther talk again.

1635
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,120
Do it, Luther.

1636
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:59,020
I can't believe it.

1637
01:24:59,240 --> 01:24:59,920
I can't believe it.

1638
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,080
Oh, Papa Coss is here!

1639
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:06,450
There he goes!

1640
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:08,450
Oh, there's my grandma.

1641
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:11,250
Is she worrying about me?

1642
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:15,310
Are you worried, Grandma?

1643
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:18,010
Oh no, he's coming over.

1644
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:19,050
They're coming over.

1645
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:19,650
We gotta go.

1646
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:22,710
I need to find the crank.

1647
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,570
It's humongous.

1648
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:27,710
That crutch might come in handy.

1649
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,150
You know what I missed though?

1650
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:31,030
I missed the beginning of the...

1651
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:33,950
Because it didn't do the intro.

1652
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:35,810
The humongous entertainment intro.

1653
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:37,130
Wait, Papa.

1654
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:38,850
Random dinosaur.

1655
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:42,310
Oh, look at him.

1656
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:43,510
Go, Skelly, go.

1657
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:44,550
That's right.

1658
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:45,870
You're fucking dead, but go.

1659
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,570
Dance for our entertainment now.

1660
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:52,110
You're stuck in purgatoria.

1661
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:53,110
Dance for children.

1662
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,410
You cried from that?

1663
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:03,430
Alright, let's see.

1664
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:05,130
Yeah, this is apparently their first game.

1665
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:05,470
Yeah.

1666
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:06,490
Is anything in here?

1667
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:07,610
Hello?

1668
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:09,950
I'm Phineas McFinn.

1669
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:12,150
The finest sailor on the seven seas.

1670
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:13,450
Arrgg.

1671
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:17,510
Arrgg.

1672
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:19,550
There's just one word that says it all.

1673
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:20,530
Arrgg.

1674
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:21,890
Arrgg when I'm happy.

1675
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:23,110
Arrgg when I'm sad.

1676
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:24,890
Arrgg when I'm good or bad.

1677
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:26,330
Arrgg.

1678
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:27,370
Arrgg to port.

1679
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:28,690
Arrgg to starboard.

1680
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:29,430
Arrgg to port.

1681
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,570
Arrgg from stem to stern.

1682
01:26:31,090 --> 01:26:31,650
Arrgg.

1683
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:32,330
Arrgg.

1684
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:32,850
So simple.

1685
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:34,850
Arrgg.

1686
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:37,410
Yo ho ho hum hum my chum.

1687
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:38,350
Arrgg.

1688
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:39,270
Arrgg.

1689
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:40,010
What might you say?

1690
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:40,970
Arrgg.

1691
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:42,430
I can't hear ya.

1692
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:43,630
Arrgg.

1693
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:44,110
One more wave.

1694
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:44,150
Arrgg.

1695
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:45,550
Bro, he's dropping the bars.

1696
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,510
When will we get his 3D debut?

1697
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:52,450
Arrgg.

1698
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:54,190
The handle is broken.

1699
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:55,710
Oh, hey.

1700
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:56,450
Arrgg.

1701
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:59,250
If you could find old Phineas another musical instrument.

1702
01:26:59,290 --> 01:26:59,410
Arrgg.

1703
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:02,430
I would gladly trade you this useless crank handle.

1704
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:02,970
Arrgg.

1705
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:04,150
You want...

1706
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:05,090
Do you wanna...

1707
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:06,010
Do you want this?

1708
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:07,270
Arrgg.

1709
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:09,970
Okay, we gotta find another instrument somewhere.

1710
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:10,910
Arrgg.

1711
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:11,210
Arrgg.

1712
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:11,670
Arrgg.

1713
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:13,930
And starring Sam Miller.

1714
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:14,490
Arrgg.

1715
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:15,990
Starring Sam Miller?

1716
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:17,450
Who the fuck is Sam Miller?

1717
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:18,170
Arrgg.

1718
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,010
Such a polite sailor.

1719
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:21,530
Arrgg.

1720
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:22,450
Wait, no.

1721
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:23,450
Not this way.

1722
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:23,850
Arrgg.

1723
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:26,810
I think there's like another way up top here, right?

1724
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,470
Arrgg.

1725
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:27,810
Yeah.

1726
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:32,010
I thought I came over...

1727
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:32,510
Yeah, there we go.

1728
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:33,750
I gotta go this way.

1729
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,590
I can't believe it.

1730
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:36,010
Wait, no.

1731
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:36,910
What?

1732
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:41,000
Oh, no.

1733
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,100
Now I know why you cried.

1734
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:43,300
Arrgg.

1735
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:48,840
Oh, no.

1736
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,820
Now I know why he cried.

1737
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:51,920
Arrgg.

1738
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:54,900
It's a loop.

1739
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:56,460
Arrgg.

1740
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:57,340
Arrgg.

1741
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,560
Arrgg.

1742
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,000
Arrgg.

1743
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:00,780
Arrgg.

1744
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,680
Wait, maybe like...

1745
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,200
Wait, she has a...

1746
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:04,820
Oh!

1747
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,620
Da-da-da-da!

1748
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,300
Here!

1749
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:09,460
Would you like this crutch?

1750
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:10,420
Aye.

1751
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,720
Me old crutch.

1752
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:14,100
Thanks, matey.

1753
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:14,920
Oh, my God.

1754
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:15,360
There we go.

1755
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:15,800
We got a guitar.

1756
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,180
Now, I don't need this old mandolin.

1757
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,640
This is where you cry.

1758
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:19,160
You're absurd.

1759
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:20,380
That's right.

1760
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,840
I have problem-solving skills of a five-year-old.

1761
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,460
That's fucking right.

1762
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:28,620
Arrgg.

1763
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:29,260
Arrgg.

1764
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:30,620
Arrgg.

1765
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:30,720
Arrgg.

1766
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:30,780
Arrgg.

1767
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,660
I did it.

1768
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:34,680
I...

1769
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:40,380
We're so proud of you, Toki.

1770
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:43,720
My...

1771
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:47,640
Oh, she can problem-solve like a five-year-old.

1772
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:48,680
She's so smart.

1773
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,400
She beat a...

1774
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,060
She beat a game for kindergarteners.

1775
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,720
The brain rod hasn't won yet.

1776
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,100
Where's my gold stars, chat?

1777
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:00,760
At the end of the game.

1778
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,540
I want my gold stars for motivation.

1779
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,320
I won't be sad.

1780
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,760
But there's no string on your guitar.

1781
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,460
He's lip synching.

1782
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:29,920
He's playing from a recording.

1783
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:30,740
Does that sound all right?

1784
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,280
This isn't live!

1785
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:34,520
I want my refunds.

1786
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:38,940
I want my fucking refund.

1787
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,020
That wasn't even a live performance.

1788
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:44,860
Pre-recorded trash!

1789
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,700
The scandal of the century.

1790
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,620
Alright, let's see.

1791
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:55,840
Time to put that in.

1792
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,960
Okay, I'm so sad I didn't explore everything.

1793
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:05,000
I'll never know what that five sea urchins are for!

1794
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,280
Okay, there it is.

1795
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:17,040
What do I do here?

1796
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:20,100
Can I open?

1797
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:23,420
Yay!

1798
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:25,820
We saved the fish population!

1799
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,260
Yeah!

1800
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,960
Uh-oh.

1801
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:34,980
No!

1802
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:43,480
Yeah!

1803
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,040
Equality for all!

1804
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,160
No!

1805
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,240
Hahaha!

1806
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:00,620
Yeah!

1807
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,140
Toki!

1808
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,240
Sharing is caring!

1809
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:19,480
We all have the same amount of food for everybody!

1810
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,580
Okay, who's gonna tell the squid father?

1811
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:25,660
Guys, who's gonna tell the squid...

1812
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:25,960
Hahaha!

1813
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:30,800
I like how we just left and be like, well, we're not gonna tell the squid father, right?

1814
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:37,990
Gangsters.

1815
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:40,470
We all know gangsters love sharing.

1816
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:43,330
Wait, it was for the theater?

1817
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:48,350
I can't believe the bottle cut me out of the theater!

1818
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:52,770
Yay!

1819
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:56,510
Grandma, look!

1820
01:31:56,770 --> 01:31:59,710
I used our year's supply of kelp seed!

1821
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:01,790
Freddy, you found the treasure!

1822
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:07,310
We did it, Grandma Mom!

1823
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:09,450
I saved your treasure, Grandma Cooper.

1824
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:10,990
Okay, fuck off, Lucy.

1825
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:13,190
Well, it seems pretty ugly little, but I figured it out.

1826
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:13,870
I hate you.

1827
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:14,670
I was very brave.

1828
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:16,510
I will anti you forever.

1829
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:17,290
I'm sure you will.

1830
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:18,030
Hahaha!

1831
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:24,810
This is why your parents left you at Grandma Mom's doorstep.

1832
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:27,650
Shut up, Lucy.

1833
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:35,590
And as a child, I had hated Lucy as a child.

1834
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:41,050
And now, it's been years and I still hate Lucy.

1835
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:46,310
It was never a phase.

1836
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:48,030
Hahaha!

1837
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:53,210
It was deep-seated hatred that's gonna go for generations.

1838
01:32:56,450 --> 01:33:00,390
Mr. Doki saved the ocean with a thousand plants and kelp.

1839
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:01,130
Bless!

1840
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:03,170
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

1841
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:04,050
Thank you, thank you.

1842
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:06,070
What are they doing?

1843
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:08,770
Oh, we did it!

1844
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:10,010
Wait, we gotta go to the theater.

1845
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:11,590
It's not over yet, guys.

1846
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:13,830
Guys, it's not over.

1847
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:15,630
We have to go to the theater.

1848
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:18,170
We got it!

1849
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:18,390
Yay!

1850
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:19,710
Humongous presents!

1851
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:23,730
Guys, I just wanna know what the theater is like, guys.

1852
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:25,310
It's not over.

1853
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:26,810
I need to know what the...

1854
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,890
Oh, let's grab some money.

1855
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:30,010
Alright.

1856
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:32,610
I'm sorry for skipping the credits.

1857
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:33,770
I need to know what the...

1858
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:35,590
I forgot what the theater is like.

1859
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:38,290
We gotta explore, guys.

1860
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:41,350
I wanna know what the theater is like.

1861
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:45,470
I remember it vaguely, but not really.

1862
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:46,330
Hahaha!

1863
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:49,090
The theater speed run.

1864
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:53,130
Oh, that's the volcano, right?

1865
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:55,990
Oh, I need a...

1866
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,990
What do I put over here?

1867
01:33:57,150 --> 01:33:57,590
Do I put...

1868
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:58,430
Oh, it's a sea urchin!

1869
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:02,950
Oh, that's what I need the money for!

1870
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:06,150
The theater is at the volcano!

1871
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:07,750
Okay.

1872
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:09,170
We gotta go.

1873
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:13,270
Never skip credits again.

1874
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:15,550
No, I need to find five dollars.

1875
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:16,390
Five dollars again?

1876
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:17,910
Okay, that's fine.

1877
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:19,690
We're gonna go fast.

1878
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:22,590
Okay.

1879
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:23,710
That's three.

1880
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:27,010
I can count because Mr. Starfish taught me how to count.

1881
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:28,850
We did it!

1882
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:31,450
Theater percent.

1883
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:32,330
Let's go!

1884
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:33,170
Hahaha!

1885
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:35,710
We gotta get the money, guys.

1886
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:37,570
We gotta be able to afford it!

1887
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:39,670
Okay, we need two more.

1888
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:41,690
It should be last two here.

1889
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:44,850
Speed running chores.

1890
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:45,530
Okay.

1891
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:47,130
Okay, we don't care about the shark.

1892
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:47,590
Okay.

1893
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:50,230
I think one was with the king, right?

1894
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:53,910
I like how we went to the king to just be like...

1895
01:34:53,910 --> 01:35:04,110
I like how we just went to the king and he's just like, hey, um, we're sort of gonna die off because, uh, we don't have like any...

1896
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:06,150
We don't have any kelp anymore.

1897
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:09,630
Like, that's literally his purpose and the money.

1898
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:11,090
Okay.

1899
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:12,130
We need one more.

1900
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:15,110
One more should be...

1901
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:15,510
It should be...

1902
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:17,270
It should be like near the clock guy.

1903
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:22,530
Because there's like one for every area, right?

1904
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:26,230
So there should be either there or...

1905
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:29,970
Okay, I don't care about your son.

1906
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:32,990
I don't care about your son.

1907
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:33,390
Let's go.

1908
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:34,750
We gotta leave.

1909
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,270
There it is!

1910
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:38,570
Yay!

1911
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,420
Anyway, let's walk over the...

1912
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:44,820
Hahaha!

1913
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:47,200
Sidestep the bottom.

1914
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,160
Let's sidestep the bottom.

1915
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:49,700
Hahaha!

1916
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:51,460
Yay!

1917
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:52,940
Oh shit, there he is.

1918
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:54,720
Don't talk to the stranger.

1919
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:55,660
Hahaha!

1920
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,040
Guys, we don't...

1921
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,960
We don't talk to that stranger, guys.

1922
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:01,240
Hahaha!

1923
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,320
Alright, we'll grab the bottle just for now.

1924
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:05,660
Okay.

1925
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:06,900
And then we gotta...

1926
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:08,580
Well, I'll go this way.

1927
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:09,540
Whoop.

1928
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:10,960
Hey there, lady.

1929
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:14,340
Whoop, she's still stuck there.

1930
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:16,800
Stepfish, I'm stuck.

1931
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:17,540
I'm stuck.

1932
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:18,460
I'm stuck.

1933
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:18,500
I'm stuck.

1934
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:18,540
I'm stuck.

1935
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:18,780
I'm stuck.

1936
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:19,540
I'm stuck.

1937
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,100
Guys, I hope I can keep this bot up.

1938
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:22,140
Hahaha!

1939
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:25,820
Hi...

1940
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:26,960
I hope we...

1941
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:27,720
Hahaha!

1942
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:29,680
Hahaha!

1943
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:31,980
Okay, let's...

1944
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,780
Okay, I wanna go to the volcano area.

1945
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,920
I have five now, I think.

1946
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:40,860
Yeah, yeah, I have five.

1947
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:42,180
That should be enough.

1948
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,000
I wanna know what the pearl is for, though.

1949
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:47,240
Hahaha!

1950
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,100
Hahaha!

1951
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:48,460
Hahaha!

1952
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:48,760
Hahaha!

1953
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:52,720
Oh, there it is!

1954
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:56,440
Okay, but that doesn't matter.

1955
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:57,820
We're here for the volcano.

1956
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,120
No, I already put two in there.

1957
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:02,500
So like...

1958
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,580
We have one more left.

1959
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:06,600
Oh, we fit!

1960
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:06,980
Nice!

1961
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:07,500
Okay.

1962
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:08,620
Come on.

1963
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,080
We don't use all because we fit automatically.

1964
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:13,460
Oh, there's the volcano!

1965
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,320
There it is!

1966
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,020
The theater is over here!

1967
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,200
The theater!

1968
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:24,380
The live show!

1969
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,720
I want to go watch!

1970
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,880
Free entertainment!

1971
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:29,620
Let's go!

1972
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,140
Oh, it's at Augie's Magnificent Show!

1973
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:36,840
This is a good way to call it here.

1974
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:42,940
Welcome girls, boys, and fish of all ages to the great show under the sea!

1975
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:43,440
It's us!

1976
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,700
We've got some great acts here today.

1977
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:49,160
Sure to make your gills quiver with delight!

1978
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:54,920
So, put your fins together for our first fantastic performance!

1979
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,400
Wait, I don't want that on the Marvellous Show!

1980
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,140
I don't want to watch a fucking fraud!

1981
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:01,060
Boo!

1982
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:04,380
Boo!

1983
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,280
Looney Tunes did it better!

1984
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,960
Not the frog!

1985
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:18,300
Okay.

1986
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,220
Get him off the stage!

1987
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,760
Oh, it's Helga the Seeing Mermaid!

1988
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:28,590
Oh, that's it.

1989
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:29,430
That was three seconds.

1990
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:30,650
The frog was faster.

1991
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:31,370
What the fuck?

1992
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:32,090
Boo!

1993
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:35,590
Oh, Amazing Augie!

1994
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:38,130
I heard it's pretty amazing.

1995
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:40,450
What's he gonna do?

1996
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,640
I paid five dollars for this!

1997
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,600
Do you know how expensive sea urchins are?

1998
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,460
Worst opera ever.

1999
01:38:57,820 --> 01:39:00,580
At least there's like six plus performances.

2000
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,520
Wait, I can jam to this.

2001
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:08,040
Lucvis von Basethoven.

2002
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,120
What a rip-off.

2003
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,460
Oh, Carpet Marina!

2004
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,780
That's when you know this game is from the 90s.

2005
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:19,700
Everybody had the lady with the fruit on top.

2006
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:20,600
Woo!

2007
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:22,700
Shake those hips, ma'am!

2008
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,340
Shake it!

2009
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:29,500
You get what you pay for.

2010
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,340
Oh, the Flying Carp Brothers.

2011
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,200
What's this?

2012
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:35,560
They're just swimming.

2013
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:38,100
They're just...

2014
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,920
It's not that impressive when, like, they're just swimming.

2015
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,300
Like...

2016
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,840
Even a child could do this.

2017
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,500
You're just swimming!

2018
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,140
Oh, hey.

2019
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:55,820
Versailles featuring Clovis P. Portoy.

2020
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:01,680
What's he gonna do?

2021
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:04,900
Is he gonna read to us?

2022
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,340
What did I do?

2023
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:10,400
Boo!

2024
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:12,200
Swords!

2025
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:15,620
What?

2026
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:19,160
He didn't even fucking read!

2027
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,640
Oh, Puffo the Amazing Expanding Fish.

2028
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,660
Oh, is he gonna expand?

2029
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:34,480
Oh, my God.

2030
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,220
There he goes.

2031
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:37,280
We're making fun of his biology.

2032
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,720
Bump and Gump.

2033
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:44,560
Holy shit, this is way more shows than I remember.

2034
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:45,740
Oh, the clouds!

2035
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:47,520
Yay!

2036
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,280
Yay!

2037
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:50,660
Yeah!

2038
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:51,760
Kill him!

2039
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,480
That's just how it goes.

2040
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:56,100
That's just how he does.

2041
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:57,800
Bro is...

2042
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:00,240
Oh, no, no!

2043
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:01,700
Get Frank off the stage!

2044
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,920
Okay, there we go.

2045
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:04,120
Nice.

2046
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:05,520
We did it.

2047
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,300
We went to the theater.

2048
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:10,520
It was not worth $5, guys.

2049
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,480
The theater was not worth $5.

2050
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:14,340
Hahaha!

2051
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:14,740
Hahaha!

2052
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:19,700
I feel scammed!

2053
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,540
I can't believe it!

2054
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,520
Anyway, we call it a year.

2055
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:33,410
That's so Lutheran to the volcano.

2056
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:34,130
True.

2057
01:41:34,650 --> 01:41:35,290
True.

2058
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:39,930
But yeah, I'm really happy I get to actually finally play Ready Fish.

2059
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:41,950
It's such a nostalgia.

2060
01:41:42,230 --> 01:41:44,990
It's such a blast from the past type deal.

2061
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:49,870
This game, as a child, definitely took me a very long time to finish.

2062
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:56,770
I remember it would take me like hours because I'm so stupid.

2063
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:00,030
I couldn't problem solve correctly.

2064
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:07,150
But there was always like super... lots of replayability.

2065
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:09,550
I think we play another humongous game.

2066
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:14,410
I definitely want to play the ones I never got a chance to play growing up.

2067
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:18,810
Because I never got the actual CD-ROM for it.

2068
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:20,350
There was demos.

2069
01:42:21,110 --> 01:42:29,190
Back then, Humongous Entertainment would give you free demo games in cereal boxes and stuff.

2070
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:34,710
To give you a taste of what you could play and it would stop you.

2071
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:35,670
Yeah, the demo disc!

2072
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:36,130
Yeah!

2073
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:40,330
So there were a lot of them that I never got a chance to play at all.

2074
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:42,230
So definitely the next one.

2075
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:42,950
I want to try one.

2076
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:43,950
I want to try...

2077
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,850
One of them that I never got a chance to play growing up.

2078
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:50,550
But my favorite was definitely the Pajama Sam series.

2079
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:53,230
Pajama Sam and Putt-Putt for sure.

2080
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:56,090
I remember playing the Putt-Putt...

2081
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:59,110
I played Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo so many times.

2082
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:03,410
Because there were so much different scenarios you could do with Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo.

2083
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:04,610
But yeah!

2084
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:05,770
That was really fun!

2085
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:08,690
Going through nostalgia and childhood stuff.

2086
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:13,230
I had a great time just like going through like...

2087
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:15,150
Just playing through my childhood.

2088
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:16,910
You know what I wish they have?

2089
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:18,390
I wish they have...

2090
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:22,690
I wish they like put the Blue's Clues game back on Steam.

2091
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:27,610
I'm really happy that the Humongous Entertainment games are on Steam.

2092
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:34,050
But I wish that the Blue's Clues Treasure Hunt was on Steam as well.

2093
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:36,650
That one game was so fun growing up.

2094
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:39,010
I played that so many times with Steve.

2095
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:41,550
Yeah, Blue's Clues Treasure Hunt.

2096
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:42,430
I think that's what it's called.

2097
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:44,230
It's called Blue's Treasure Hunt.

2098
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:46,370
That was such a good...

2099
01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:46,870
That was...

2100
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:48,270
That was fucking fire!

2101
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:53,410
And then there would be like stuff from Steve where he goes like...

2102
01:43:53,410 --> 01:43:54,690
Blue's gonna do...

2103
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:55,710
You can do!

2104
01:43:56,170 --> 01:43:57,850
And he goes into like...

2105
01:43:57,850 --> 01:43:59,830
And then he does the thinking chair and everything.

2106
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:02,730
I'm this Blue's Treasure Hunt.

2107
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:07,250
They're all abandonware.

2108
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:08,770
Yeah, but I still...

2109
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:11,510
I wish they could put it up on Steam and stuff.

2110
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:11,970
Cause like...

2111
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:12,530
Even though they're...

2112
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,590
They're like...

2113
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:15,310
Um...

2114
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:15,910
Um...

2115
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:16,710
I feel like...

2116
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:17,210
I don't know.

2117
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:19,030
I still wanna like support...

2118
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:21,750
Support the people that made that game.

2119
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:25,170
Cause it was such a big part of my childhood and everything.

2120
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:27,210
It was just such a fun game back then.

2121
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:28,590
Um...

2122
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:29,410
Uh...

2123
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:29,690
Felia!

2124
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:30,530
Thank you for the farm!

2125
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:31,270
Get the shits!

2126
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:31,590
Thank you!

2127
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:32,130
Thank you!

2128
01:44:32,130 --> 01:44:32,610
Sir Ken!

2129
01:44:32,730 --> 01:44:33,970
Welcome to Tomato Farm!

2130
01:44:34,050 --> 01:44:34,390
Welcome!

2131
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:34,910
Welcome!

2132
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:36,050
But yeah!

2133
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:37,950
I'm really, really happy I was able to...

2134
01:44:37,950 --> 01:44:38,850
Uh...

2135
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:39,710
I'm really...

2136
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:43,090
I'm really happy I was able to actually like play the game for finally.

2137
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:43,950
Um...

2138
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:44,230
And...

2139
01:44:44,230 --> 01:44:46,950
Cause I haven't been able to play in a long time.

2140
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:48,430
Um...

2141
01:44:48,850 --> 01:44:49,370
Since you know...

2142
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:50,370
Since I was a child.

2143
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:52,450
Cause I never touched any of the...

2144
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:57,510
I never touched any of the Humongous Entertainment game until like today.

2145
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:01,650
It's been like so many years.

2146
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:03,050
It's been...

2147
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:08,450
The last time I actually played a Humongous Entertainment game was like I said when I was like a child playing it.

2148
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:11,530
So it was really nice to revisit like nostalgia and stuff.

2149
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:13,630
And revisit my hate for Luther.

2150
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:18,130
If as a kid I...

2151
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:22,990
If as a kid I recognized the feeling of hate for that stupid green fish.

2152
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:23,830
Um...

2153
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:29,170
That's when you know I hated him so much.

2154
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:34,070
All that he did was cause trouble.

2155
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:34,970
And...

2156
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:35,590
And...

2157
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:36,210
And...

2158
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:36,730
And...

2159
01:45:38,010 --> 01:45:41,570
He was a bad influence on Freddy.

2160
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:45,230
Um...

2161
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:45,850
But yeah.

2162
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:50,130
I hope you guys had a fun time watching and going through memory lane with me.

2163
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:51,330
Um...

2164
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:54,150
I am going to chill a little bit.

2165
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:56,590
I won't be in the Humongous collab right away.

2166
01:45:56,770 --> 01:45:58,450
I'm gonna chill and zone out.

2167
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:05,210
But we do have another collab as well at 11pm with Restia and RPR for Apex Legends.

2168
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:05,850
So...

2169
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:06,090
Uh...

2170
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:07,290
We're gonna be playing Rink I believe.

2171
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:10,090
I mean I feel like we should because our team is pretty stacked.

2172
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:13,530
So I feel like pubs would be like really boring if we played pubs.

2173
01:46:13,690 --> 01:46:14,510
But uh...

2174
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:14,850
So yeah.

2175
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:16,490
We're gonna be playing Apex Legends Rink.

2176
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:17,010
Uh...

2177
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:19,110
Later at 11pm.

2178
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:19,910
So that'll be fun.

2179
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:21,870
I haven't touched Apex in a bit.

2180
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:22,950
So uh...

2181
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:24,910
So I definitely need to warm up again.

2182
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:25,550
Uh...

2183
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:28,010
I definitely need to warm up a lot.

2184
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:29,610
Ahhhh.

2185
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:33,150
So I need to figure out if like...

2186
01:46:33,150 --> 01:46:33,730
I'm doing...

2187
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:35,710
If I'm gonna do this deadlock tournament or whatever.

2188
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:37,930
I've been getting so many invites to things.

2189
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:38,850
It's actually crazy.

2190
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:39,250
I...

2191
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:39,810
I...

2192
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:40,530
I like...

2193
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:41,170
I don't know.

2194
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:42,850
It's such a new feeling.

2195
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:43,690
I never...

2196
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:44,330
It's always like...

2197
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:46,030
In the past I always had to like...

2198
01:46:46,030 --> 01:46:48,150
Ask to be invited to things.

2199
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:48,970
Or like...

2200
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:49,390
You know...

2201
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:50,810
Ask if I could be invited to stuff.

2202
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:51,430
Or like...

2203
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:51,670
Um...

2204
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:52,990
If people wanna collab with me.

2205
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:53,470
I always had...

2206
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:54,410
I was the one to initiate.

2207
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:55,950
So it's like...

2208
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:56,430
It...

2209
01:46:56,430 --> 01:46:57,750
I feel so...

2210
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:58,270
I don't know.

2211
01:46:58,310 --> 01:47:02,370
I think like I'm really happy that people are asking me to join things now.

2212
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:03,350
Cause it's...

2213
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:04,670
It's such a nice feeling.

2214
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:05,830
To be asked for...

2215
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:07,250
Instead of doing the asking.

2216
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:10,410
But it's also like...

2217
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:12,950
It's so hard to say no too.

2218
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:14,030
Cause it's like...

2219
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:17,190
I've never had so many of these opportunities before.

2220
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:20,310
I've never had like...

2221
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:21,870
So much of these opportunities.

2222
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:23,470
So it's like...

2223
01:47:23,470 --> 01:47:24,550
It's so hard to say no.

2224
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:25,410
Cause it's like...

2225
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:25,950
Oh my god.

2226
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:27,110
I wanna do it all.

2227
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:27,690
You know?

2228
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:30,170
I was like...

2229
01:47:30,170 --> 01:47:31,110
I was just like...

2230
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:31,810
Oh my god.

2231
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:33,090
I just wanna do it all.

2232
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:35,510
Cause people were requesting me to join.

2233
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:35,830
And I was like...

2234
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:36,170
I feel...

2235
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:36,750
I feel like...

2236
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:37,350
Oh my god.

2237
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:38,930
You want me to join you guys?

2238
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:40,590
So then I feel like...

2239
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:41,650
Oh that's so sweet.

2240
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:42,770
So then I just say yes.

2241
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:43,350
Cause I was like...

2242
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:44,710
That's really sweet of you to ask.

2243
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:45,670
But like...

2244
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:46,830
For a deadlock tournament...

2245
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:47,690
I have to think about it.

2246
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:47,970
Because...

2247
01:47:47,970 --> 01:47:49,210
I don't know about deadlock.

2248
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:50,070
Like literally...

2249
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:51,070
If sureforce says no...

2250
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:51,850
I'm gonna say no.

2251
01:47:51,970 --> 01:47:52,230
Cause...

2252
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:54,630
My team is heavily dependent...

2253
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:55,290
On like...

2254
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:56,950
If sureforce is gonna join me or not.

2255
01:47:57,050 --> 01:47:58,650
Cause I don't know how to play deadlock.

2256
01:47:58,850 --> 01:47:59,250
Like...

2257
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:02,570
I don't know how to...

2258
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:05,510
And he's been grinding that shit non-stop.

2259
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:07,150
He's like the only person...

2260
01:48:07,150 --> 01:48:07,290
I've ever met.

2261
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:07,690
And I know...

2262
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:09,130
Who's currently streaming it.

2263
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:10,990
That's like a fucking gamer at that game.

2264
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:16,810
Where's the Among Us collab?

2265
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:17,690
I believe...

2266
01:48:17,690 --> 01:48:18,770
All the other people that are...

2267
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:19,910
Most of the people that are in it...

2268
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:20,730
Will be streaming it.

2269
01:48:20,810 --> 01:48:21,490
So let me...

2270
01:48:21,490 --> 01:48:22,050
See...

2271
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:23,030
Look at the names again.

2272
01:48:23,650 --> 01:48:24,130
Um...

2273
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:25,270
It is with...

2274
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:33,670
LM, Sykuno, Valkyrie, Ironmouse, Masayoshi, Blau, Hewn, Foolish, Chatterbox, Cellbit, Itolls, Janet, and Ludwig.

2275
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:34,470
So like...

2276
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:37,270
Those are the names that are apparently in the Among Us lives.

2277
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:39,950
But I'll be showing up later.

2278
01:48:40,210 --> 01:48:41,510
So I won't be showing up right away.

2279
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:42,930
Because like I need to chill.

2280
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:44,110
I need to relax.

2281
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:48,370
Um...

2282
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:48,650
Yeah.

2283
01:48:48,730 --> 01:48:50,150
He's a deadlock streamer now.

2284
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:51,890
That's the only reason why I'm asking.

2285
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:54,990
Because he knows what he's doing.

2286
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:57,510
But yeah.

2287
01:48:57,550 --> 01:48:58,010
There's like...

2288
01:48:58,010 --> 01:48:59,330
A lot of tournaments.

2289
01:48:59,430 --> 01:49:00,970
And a lot of events.

2290
01:49:01,210 --> 01:49:02,070
There's so...

2291
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,630
Like...

2292
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:03,950
The next couple of weeks.

2293
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:06,510
You're gonna see so many tournaments.

2294
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:07,250
And events.

2295
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:08,410
I'll be joining.

2296
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:09,930
Because like I said yes to them.

2297
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:11,290
And some of them are sponsored too.

2298
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:12,090
So like...

2299
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:13,770
So like it's gonna...

2300
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:14,690
It's gonna be wild.

2301
01:49:16,330 --> 01:49:18,450
My schedule is sooo...

2302
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:20,170
Packed.

2303
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:23,030
It's actually...

2304
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:26,290
It's soo fucking packed right now.

2305
01:49:29,290 --> 01:49:31,130
Next week is like...

2306
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:33,450
I think next week is like...

2307
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:35,890
There's a lot going on next week.

2308
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:36,630
I know like...

2309
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:39,370
Um, there's a lot of collapse next week.

2310
01:49:41,330 --> 01:49:43,770
And so, we'll see how it goes.

2311
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:48,590
Anyway, um, thank you all for hanging out with me.

2312
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:50,350
I always love hanging out with you guys, Dragoons.

2313
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:55,190
And as, oh wait, before I leave, I wanna talk, I just wanna chill and talk a little bit.

2314
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:57,310
But did you guys see the new anti-cheat in Deadlock?

2315
01:49:57,430 --> 01:50:00,930
Speaking of Deadlock, did you guys see the new anti-cheat in Deadlock?

2316
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:04,350
Where apparently they turn you into a frog and they find out you're cheating.

2317
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:09,930
The community can vote on either, like, banning you immediately or turning you into a frog.

2318
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:12,330
And, like, force you to play the game as a frog.

2319
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:19,430
And, like, what's fucking hilarious is that this update was supposed to be for CSGO.

2320
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:24,310
Like, you're supposed to be turned into a chicken or something.

2321
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:30,110
Originally, the first concept of it was originally for CSGO.

2322
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:32,930
And then you were supposed to turn into a chicken.

2323
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:34,330
And then the CSGO...

2324
01:50:34,350 --> 01:50:41,230
The CSGO players were so mad because they were like, I can't believe they released this...

2325
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:45,830
They released this update on the anniversary of CSGO.

2326
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:48,450
And I was like, that's so fucked.

2327
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:53,920
I was like, oh shit.

2328
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:58,010
And sighed.

2329
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:02,090
They literally took something that was for that game.

2330
01:51:02,090 --> 01:51:07,890
And it ended up fucking on the anniversary.

2331
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:12,010
Oh my god.

2332
01:51:12,410 --> 01:51:14,130
That's so sad.

2333
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:16,460
I was like, that's so sad.

2334
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:17,870
It's their anniversary.

2335
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:21,930
And you grave robbed the corpse.

2336
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:25,870
You took their only thing they wanted.

2337
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:28,390
Was a better anti-cheat.

2338
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:30,530
And you gave it to Deadlock.

2339
01:51:30,930 --> 01:51:31,550
I...

2340
01:51:35,050 --> 01:51:36,330
That's so...

2341
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:38,350
That's so sad.

2342
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:45,470
I feel so bad for them.

2343
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:47,450
I feel so bad.

2344
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:50,730
This is why I found it.

2345
01:51:51,150 --> 01:51:53,410
But yeah, I thought it was funny.

2346
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:55,030
But also a little sad.

2347
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:56,410
A little sad there.

2348
01:51:57,350 --> 01:51:58,070
And...

2349
01:51:59,250 --> 01:51:59,750
And yeah.

2350
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:03,310
FireRed moves by the death.

2351
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:04,930
King is dead.

2352
01:52:05,030 --> 01:52:08,370
And I think it's like CS2 didn't do as well as they expected.

2353
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:09,490
So...

2354
01:52:09,490 --> 01:52:12,270
Because CS2 didn't do as well as they expected.

2355
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:16,710
And Deadlock right now is like really, really, really popular at the moment.

2356
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:19,730
Despite being like closed invite only.

2357
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:23,270
I'm pretty sure they're just putting all their resources onto...

2358
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:26,350
Onto Deadlock now.

2359
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:27,190
They're just like...

2360
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:28,370
They cut the line on us.

2361
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:28,810
They're like...

2362
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:32,530
Alright, here are all the updates for CS2 that we had going in.

2363
01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:33,750
And then they're like...

2364
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:35,030
Alright, let's move all of that...

2365
01:52:35,030 --> 01:52:35,870
To Deadlock.

2366
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:39,290
They're just like...

2367
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:40,050
Yeah, they did.

2368
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:41,410
They released CS2 like...

2369
01:52:41,410 --> 01:52:44,630
Way too early to try and capitalize hype.

2370
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:45,990
But like...

2371
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:49,850
What was funny was that everybody was opening knife cases and everything.

2372
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:50,890
Knives and everything.

2373
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:51,710
Because they're like...

2374
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:53,630
Oh my god, CS2 is gonna be just like CSGO.

2375
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:54,790
And it's gonna like...

2376
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:56,110
Even increase the knife...

2377
01:52:56,110 --> 01:52:56,750
Knife...

2378
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:57,250
Um...

2379
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:59,010
The knife resale value.

2380
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:01,070
But it ended up sort of destroying the economy.

2381
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:02,110
Um...

2382
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:02,930
The knife economy.

2383
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:03,870
Because you know...

2384
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:04,510
CS2...

2385
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:06,170
Destroyed CSGO.

2386
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:08,970
CS2...

2387
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:09,510
Uh...

2388
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:10,750
Fucked over CSGO.

2389
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:12,070
And then...

2390
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:12,550
Um...

2391
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:14,210
And then the knife economy sort of collapsed.

2392
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:17,270
And now mostly people are trading knives to...

2393
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:17,950
Um...

2394
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:18,770
What was it called?

2395
01:53:18,990 --> 01:53:20,270
For embezzlement.

2396
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:20,730
Like...

2397
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:21,590
Is it embezzlement?

2398
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:22,130
What is it called?

2399
01:53:22,230 --> 01:53:23,590
When people are like...

2400
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:24,610
Um...

2401
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:25,550
Cause like...

2402
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:26,590
It's like art galleries.

2403
01:53:26,650 --> 01:53:30,630
Where people aren't buying the art for the actual art piece.

2404
01:53:30,850 --> 01:53:32,490
But they're using it to...

2405
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:33,270
Money laundering!

2406
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:33,730
Yes!

2407
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:35,430
Most like...

2408
01:53:35,430 --> 01:53:36,070
Mostly...

2409
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:38,210
The knife economy is...

2410
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:40,670
Is mostly a money laundering scam.

2411
01:53:42,170 --> 01:53:42,730
Yeah!

2412
01:53:42,970 --> 01:53:44,410
Yeah, you guys didn't know that.

2413
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:47,670
Like that's why some of the knives are incredibly expensive.

2414
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:50,070
Cause they use that to money launder.

2415
01:53:51,210 --> 01:53:52,750
Same with art galleries.

2416
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:54,070
People don't really buy...

2417
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:55,530
That's why some art pieces are incredibly expensive.

2418
01:53:55,530 --> 01:53:57,670
Because it's all...

2419
01:53:57,670 --> 01:53:58,810
It's mostly been like...

2420
01:53:58,810 --> 01:53:59,710
For money laundering.

2421
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:00,890
It's not actually for the artwork.

2422
01:54:01,690 --> 01:54:02,170
Um...

2423
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:03,770
Yeah.

2424
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:04,230
Haha.

2425
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:05,190
It's crazy.

2426
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:07,370
But yeah.

2427
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:10,370
CS2 sort of destroyed the knife economy.

2428
01:54:10,490 --> 01:54:11,650
Because everybody thought...

2429
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:12,230
It like...

2430
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:13,010
Popped the bubble.

2431
01:54:13,170 --> 01:54:13,930
The knife bubble.

2432
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:14,910
Uh...

2433
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:16,970
Because people thought it was gonna be the next big thing.

2434
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:17,510
And then...

2435
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:19,370
They ended up releasing the game...

2436
01:54:19,370 --> 01:54:21,470
A lot earlier than it should be.

2437
01:54:21,550 --> 01:54:24,170
So there are so many things that were missing in CS2.

2438
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:25,510
To a point where like...

2439
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:26,370
People just like...

2440
01:54:26,370 --> 01:54:27,930
Didn't care about CS2 anymore.

2441
01:54:28,290 --> 01:54:28,730
Anyway.

2442
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:29,810
Uh...

2443
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:30,890
I'm gonna cut it here.

2444
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,390
Guys.

2445
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:33,950
Gave you some nice trivia facts there.

2446
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:38,150
But I'm gonna cut it here.

2447
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:39,610
As always everybody.

2448
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:41,370
Stay hydrated.

2449
01:54:41,670 --> 01:54:42,330
Posture check.

2450
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:43,290
Get up and move around.

2451
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:44,550
To get that blood flowing.

2452
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:45,890
And if you stay up for me.

2453
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:46,790
Head to bed.

2454
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:47,750
Cause...

2455
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:48,770
You deserve it.

2456
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:50,530
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2457
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:52,130
Bye guys.

2458
01:54:52,890 --> 01:54:53,450
Bye.

2459
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:55,390
I just read the...

2460
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:55,490
There's a...

2461
01:54:55,510 --> 01:54:56,170
There was no chat here.

2462
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:56,690
So let me...

2463
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:57,330
I'll get...

2464
01:54:57,330 --> 01:54:57,570
Put...

2465
01:54:57,570 --> 01:54:58,470
I'll keep...

2466
01:54:58,470 --> 01:55:00,590
I'll save you guys for just one last second.

2467
01:55:00,830 --> 01:55:01,470
There you go.

2468
01:55:01,510 --> 01:55:02,810
You guys are live now!

2469
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:03,830
Anyway.

2470
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:04,430
I will see you guys.

2471
01:55:04,570 --> 01:55:04,830
Bye!
