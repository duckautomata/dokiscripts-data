00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,890
Hello, hello!

2
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:57,770
Today is a special day because we are playing, finally
playing the one Sonic game that I've been dying to play for

3
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,150
so fucking long.

4
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,110
Shadow the Hedgehog!

5
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:09,690
Some people were very confused what game this was because it
did say Shadow the Hedgehog reloaded.

6
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:21,390
So for those who are wondering what game this is, this is
literally the original uh yeah the the edge lord himself the

7

sorry second to 13th sorry uh i don't i'm so ahead of i'm so

20
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:30,770
professional i know i'm so well versed in all the things i'm
supposed to be in uh very up to date obviously um uh so

21
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:41,210
there's that um what else i want to say um oh yes so
Hedgehog Reloaded is actually is is the original shadow the

22
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:49,090
uh, I was gonna say edge lord Shadow you know fuck it shadow
the edge lord uh GameCube game but is a modded version of

23
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:59,430
the game where it makes it less I guess like less fucked up
less tilting the play because obviously for some reason

24
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:12,430
they've only made one game for shadow despite how popular he
is um because apparently when the game first came out it

25
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:26,110
wasn't that good who would have thought apparently one of
the issues is that he doesn't go very fast which is you know

26
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:33,010
crazy to think about because Sonic games the whole premise
is that you gotta go fast and one thing they fixed is that

27
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,490
Yeah, it's basically a quality of life.

28
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,050
They basically made quality of life changes.

29
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,510
In the Shadow the Edge Lord reloaded.

30
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,770
There were a lot of performance issues.

31
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:57,570
But the one thing, the one thing that I was looking forward
to the most for this game, like I said, I wanted to play

32
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,150
this game for a very, very long time, even when I was in
Corpa.

33
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:10,130
But the reason why I couldn't play it is because for some
reason they never remastered this game I don't know why is

34
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:20,770
it because he had a gun is it because like he is it because
he had a not just a gun but a submachine gun so they were

35
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:35,610
like maybe we shouldn't remaster it there's no way to
actually play this game on modern on PC until now and I had

36
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,830
I was looking up like how to play and a lot of people were
like oh yeah you gotta play the reloaded version because

37
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:47,330
they fixed all the issues of the original games I was like
okay um so this is the reloaded version so all the gripes

38
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:54,090
you had when you when this game first came out when you were
a little kid um look no further they apparently fixed all of

39
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:04,330
that but still kept the edge because he is the greatest life
form um also a life update um okay I forgot to tell you guys

40
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,990
this story But basically, I was shopping for groceries.

41
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,770
I think like a week or two ago, I was shopping for groceries
like two weeks ago.

42
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,390
And it was like, you know, two weeks ago, it was around like
the 10th to 15th timeline.

43
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,430
This is very important, by the way.

44
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,610
This is very important.

45
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,890
So, and then I decided I was just like, you know what?

46
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:44,350
want to buy some string cheese i haven't had mozzarella
string cheese in so long oh i feel like a child today and

47
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:52,190
i'm craving some mozzarella string cheese so it was a good
good choice from doki too good choice from past doki because

48
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:59,710
every day i had one stick of string cheese because i forgot
how addicted i was eating mozzarella string cheese um

49
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,730
because when i was in middle school i my mom would always
get me mozzarella string cheese and i would have it like i

50
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:11,210
would have one stick every day because I was just so
addicted to it it's just the good shit anyway so after a

51
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:21,430
week plus of eating you know one stick of string cheese
every day I finally decided to look at the expiration date

52
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:30,390
because I was like oh you know what how when do these expire
I gotta make sure I'm not eating expired cheese and the

53
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:46,290
expiration date on it was no 5th and do you remember when I
bought the string cheese I was like how is this expired

54
00:08:46,290 --> 00:09:04,590
before I even bought the cheese so technically I've been
eating expired cheese the entire time and I was just like I

55
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,310
was like how is this still in the grocery store.

56
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,210
I didn't think I had to check the bag of string cheese
before I purchased it.

57
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,450
Because you would assume those would, they would have not
even been purchasable.

58
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,750
Because I purchased it after it expired.

59
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,930
Neglected cheese.

60
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,770
And it's not, it was, I took the first pack.

61
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,830
I didn't like scrounge at the back and took the last pack.

62
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:49,130
I took the, I took the first pack i saw i so so i i've ate
i've been eating expired string cheese for like at least

63
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:57,050
eight days straight before i realized that this expired
before i even like fucking paid for it

64
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:13,670
um so yeah no this was just a little life update because now
i realize i'm i can't i didn't realize i you know what okay

65
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,950
so the thing is i would look for like milk and stuff i'll
look at expiration for milk because like milk and eggs

66
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:25,290
because like that's like more important to me but i would
never thought that there would be something like i don't

67
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:34,530
know i guess i'm so fucking naive to think that like what's
in the store will not be expired by then you know like

68
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:43,590
Because I'm like I bought it a week after it expired So
that's why I was I was so confused.

69
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,370
No, it says expired.

70
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:59,730
It's not So So I was just like I don't know I felt like you
would it would still be fucking purchasable if it's already

71
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,230
past the date But yeah

72
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:18,550
so so that's a life update now i need it now i know that i
have to make sure everything is now i gotta make sure that

73
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:26,770
everything um everything is like the correct date before i
buy stuff uh angriest thank you for super chat thank you

74
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:32,330
thank you grocery store tech always grab the item from the
back of the stock because they usually have the furthest

75
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,770
expiration date they use super you.

76
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:36,630
Gus, thank you.

77
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:44,190
The ultimate life form uses guns because guns are the
ultimate weapon, not that nerd magic pew pew shit.

78
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,890
I mean, all Sonic does is just he jumps on people.

79
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,310
That's like so fucking, what's the word?

80
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,910
That's so prehistoric, you know, like get on with the time,
Sonic.

81
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,090
Here, have a gun.

82
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,270

Just what was that all about?

163
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,360
If he says he knows the truth about who I am, then like it
or not, I have to believe that.

164
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,520
Yes, listen to the devil.

165
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,920

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,920
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

176
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,860
I have a feeling that I'm supposed to be able to go a little
faster.

177
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
Oh, there you go.

178
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,040
All right, there you go.

179
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,040
I figured it out.

180
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,640
Okay, why am I not going forward?

181
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,440

There we go.

187
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,520
Alright, there we go.

188
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,360
I figured it out.

189
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,620
Hello, sir.

190
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,860
The X-Bug lets me spin-dash and perform other actions.

191
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,680
Alright, sir.

192
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,600
I figured it out.

193
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,100
And finally, how do I talk to you?

194
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
Sir, how do I talk to you?

195
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,320
Sir, I want to talk to you.

196
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,000
Are you, can I talk to you?

197
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,020
I press X to love.

198
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,900
Let's see this.

199
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
Touch the question.

200
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,100
I have no question mark button.

201
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,420
Okay, let's see.

202
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,760
I have I binded everything.

203
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,240
What else am I missing?

204
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,280
Oh, is he dead?

205
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,980
No, see he's raising his arm.

206
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Look.

207
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,640
He's Guys, he's raising his arm.

208
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,160
There's no way he's dead.

209
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,760
All right, fuck it.

210
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll kill him.

211
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,860
All right, hello, Sonic.

212
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,040
Sonic?

213
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,220
Sonic?

214
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:09,720
What?

215
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,100
Sonic?

216
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,980
You on top?

217
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,400
Okay, bye.

218
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,340
I guess he doesn't.

219
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,100
Oh, shit.

220
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,340
Oh, my God.

221
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,500
Am I not shooting you?

222
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,720
Okay, we gotta go fast.

223
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,200
Please, just, I think I just need a gun.

224
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,780
Oh, shit.

225
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,560
Oh, I don't know.

226
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,740
Is he a good guy?

227
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,480
Oh, that was his HP.

228
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,640
Okay, I'm figuring it out.

229
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,460
Guys, I need a gun.

230
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,300
Okay, I killed him.

231
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,240
We didn't see it.

232
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,500
Guys, he's not dead.

233
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, he has a gun.

234
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,580
Let's go.

235
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,560
Okay, nice.

236
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,440
Okay, we have to kill him.

237
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:57,280
him zero in and attack enemies by pressing the a bar in the
middle of a jump okay now now that's why that's that's what

238
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,820
i like let's go what the heck is hq doing i can swap the
weapon on here

239
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,060
oh wait he has a gun too oh okay it's okay it's okay i just
got one one ring.

240
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,000
Okay, okay, it's not okay.

241
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:17,640
It's okay.

242
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,180
I'll hit the man.

243
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,360
He's easier to kill.

244
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,240
Oh my god!

245
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,000
Okay, he is not easier to kill.

246
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,480
It's okay.

247
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,100
Oh my god, it's okay.

248
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,340
He is easier to kill.

249
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,940
There you go.

250
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,920
Alright, I figured it out.

251
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,000
Now I have a gun.

252
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,000
Alright.

253
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,740
Guys, now I think I know why this game didn't get a sequel.

254
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,340
Okay.

255
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,600
I think I don't now.

256
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,880
I think it's getting pretty obvious why.

257
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,680
And this is the quality of life version.

258
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
A skill issue.

259
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,780
I'm a little concerned what the non-quality of life version
was like.

260
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,980
It's okay.

261
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,840
That sounds like a skill issue.

262
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,040
You're right, you're right.

263
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,660
It was a skill issue, guys.

264
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,620
You're right, you're right.

265
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,440
How dare I tell perfection?

266
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,580
Alright, don't worry.

267
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,200
We can slowly go up.

268
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,460
Oh, nice shortcut.

269
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,820
Wait, what?

270
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,600
What am I supposed to do with this?

271
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,600
With this?

272
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,460
Oh.

273
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,440
Alright, here we go.

274
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,220
Oh, cool.

275
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
I'm not gonna go down.

276
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,340
Whether they like it or not.

277
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,260
Wee!

278
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,640
Oh my god, behold!

279
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,300
The ultimate power!

280
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,400
Oh, I'm so fast.

281
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,820
I am so fast right now.

282
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,900
Child, please, get down.

283
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,460
I repeat, this is not a grill.

284
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,380
That's right!

285
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,380
Oh, that's it.

286
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,340
Okay, that was a bit anticlimactic.

287
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,160
Not gonna lie.

288
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,420
Oh, where am I?

289
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,340
Oh!

290
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,900
How did I just happen to...

291
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,620
Okay, it's fine.

292
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,960
It's fine.

293
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,880
I went too fast.

294
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,840
That was on me.

295
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,620
That was on me, guys.

296
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,820
I went too fast.

297
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,880
Oh.

298
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,060
What's this?

299
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,740
I think I can use this.

300
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,460
I can try.

301
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,800
Oh my god.

302
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,720
I don't need a license for this.

303
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,440
What if I...

304
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,140
playing.

305
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,420
What is this game?

306
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,920
I don't know!

307
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,060
Shadow!

308
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:49,720
No!

309
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm too fast!

310
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,940
I'm too fucking fast, Cash.

311
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,830
I can't help it!

312
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,080
GTA Edge Lord, let's go.

313
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,680
Do I even have a lifespan on this car?

314
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,240
Oh my god, this car is so fucking strong.

315
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,780
I don't know.

316
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,480
I don't even know what the fuck is happening.

317
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,240
We found it.

318
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,380
We got the chaos emerald.

319
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,540
There you go.

320
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,740
She's not playing.

321
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,980
Once I find all of the emeralds, then I'll find the truth.

322
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,460
Nice.

323
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,440
We did it, guys.

324
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,040
We got two chaos emeralds.

325
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,480
Since you're playing Silent Fan News, Mad Record, Project
06, it's Sonic 06, but good.

326
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,680
James, thank you to Super Chat.

327
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,120
Thank you.

328
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,880
Thank you.

329
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,520
So they use super chat.

330
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,140
Thank you.

331
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,540
They shadowed a headshot.

332
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,520
Hit and run.

333
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,820
I... Yeah, E for excellent, guys.

334
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,860
E for excellent.

335
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,720
E for easy.

336
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,220
The black aliens have hit six major cities around the world.

337
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,700
And every city is reporting significant damage and
casualties.

338
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,460
Oh my god.

339
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,820
Surely it's not my fault, right?

340
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,580
The defense system.

341
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,440
Downtown Westopolis has been almost...

342
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,660
Completely destroyed.

343
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,220
Unconfirmed sources have also reported This is the original
game, but better.

344
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,220
They did quality of life changes.

345
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,920
It's crazy that this is the quality of life change.

346
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,460
Then kill them all.

347
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,480
But, sir, isn't Shadow on our side?

348
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,960
I gave you an order, soldier.

349
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,680
He's evil and he's the enemy.

350
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,980
Just because I'm edgy, I'm evil.

351
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,500
Oh, guys, come on.

352
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,940
That's racist.

353
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,740
You're mine.

354
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,020
and I have my rights to bear arms.

355
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,880
This is America.

356
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,980
I'll have two now.

357
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,040
You've deliberately disobeyed me, Shadow.

358
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,080
No one tells me what to do.

359
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,440
I have my own reasons for collecting the Chaos Emeralds.

360
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,800
You really don't understand the situation here, do you?

361
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,440
Perhaps Professor Gerald has done more to your memory than I
imagine.

362
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,480
You know who I am?

363
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,800
You know about Maria?

364
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,400
Strange that you don't remember.

365
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,780
Your maker.

366
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,600
I have a father?

367
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,560
Silence.

368
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,340
The ramifications of your disobedience will be severe.

369
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,760
You're not American.

370
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,140
You don't know that.

371
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,560
My creator was American.

372
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,820
And so by proxy, Shadow is also American.

373
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,720
I was made in America.

374
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,430
Where am I?

375
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,530
Where am I?

376
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:14,810
USA USA Whoa, I guess I underestimated his powers He was
made in space You don't know that he lost his memory

377
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,160
I don't remember this place.

378
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,920
Oh, I'm so fast.

379
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,780
Yeah Oh my god.

380
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,400
Sonic has nothing on me.

381
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,840
Look how fast I am as I slowly fall down.

382
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,960
I like how like they try to talk to me.

383
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,760
Oh wait, it's Knuckles.

384
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,480
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit.

385
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,840
Quick grab a gun, Knuckles.

386
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,200
It's the only way.

387
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,000
Wait, what?

388
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,460
I'm trying.

389
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,680
Wait, how did you jump?

390
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,400
Oh there.

391
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,100
Alright, there you go.

392
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,520
Knuckles.

393
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,320
Why are you using knuckles?

394
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,100
Just grab a gun there everywhere.

395
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,540
Alright, wait, wait.

396
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,840
Boom.

397
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,460
Oh, wait.

398
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:09,980
What's this?

399
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,860
Oh, alright.

400
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,300
Sucked up.

401
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,400
We're sucked up by the cyclone.

402
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,960
Wait, where are we now?

403
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,320
Oh, God, we're so fast.

404
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,540
Loop the loop.

405
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,360
That's right.

406
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,960
Truly the perfect life for.

407
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,920
Oh, shit!

408
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,040
What are you guys doing with a sword?

409
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,500
That's for pussies!

410
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,380
Wait, I gotta grab the gun.

411
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,040
Oh, no, wait.

412
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,800
It's heat seeking.

413
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:48,910
Wait.

414
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,550
Gun.

415
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,470
Oh, shit!

416
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,630
He cheated!

417
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,670
He hit behind!

418
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,810
Wait, I want this.

419
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,170
This has more ammo.

420
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,450
Grab the sword.

421
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,570
Why get a sword when I have bullets?

422
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,570
What the fuck is a sword gonna do for me, guys?

423
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,210
When there is guns!

424
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,510
Oh shit.

425
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,870
I should have shot all of it off.

426
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,290
Going to...

427
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,570
Going to Wicked now.

428
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,970
That sword makes you look cool.

429
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,070
Oh my god, shadow, please.

430
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,110
Right here you go.

431
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,330
Apparently in the original game, you had to kill everyone.

432
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,350
Like...

433
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,490
Oh, whoops, sorry.

434
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:56,810
In the original, like the non-reloaded version, you would
have to kill every single enemy.

435
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:09,990
to progress so like yeah this is why we're playing the
reloaded no don't say that no no we don't can i kill him oh

436
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:17,770
i killed it oh that's oh that's awkward oh that's awkward
it's okay i might have actually used my entire machine gun

437
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,110
on it what's this

438
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:35,020
only for oh i don't know what i did what happened Oh my god.

439
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
Oh my god.

440
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,140
And it makes me do all...

441
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,940
Okay, there you go.

442
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,220
It makes me go back to the beginning.

443
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,980
Oh, there's good and evil paths?

444
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,580
Watch out.

445
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,060
Alright.

446
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,620
Slow and steady in my Sonic game.

447
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Do I just destroy it?

448
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,240
What the fuck do I do?

449
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:20,670
I do is this how do I destroy it guys what do I do oh okay

No!

453
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,810
Take me back!

454
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,010

Why?

458
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,110
Why does the kid take you back?

459
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,790
Okay.

460
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,390
Alright, let's grab this and leave.

461
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,910
Alright, here we go.

462
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,550
Guys, you don't understand.

463
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,450
I think... I think sometimes he goes too fast.

464
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:02,950
Oh my god.

Oh, it's a secret ring?

472
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,460

473
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,300
I'm like, oh!

474
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,000

All right.

487
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,940
I think I actually prefer the gun more, but it's okay.

488
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,360
Activated another one?

489
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,280
Surely that's not gonna...

00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,800

I didn't realize there's like different stages for different
paths.

I like how it's like non-descript flag.

00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,310
We all know it's America.

504
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:28,450
Tell the commanding generals that the United Federation will
never surrender to terrorists.

505
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,110
Yes, Mr. President.

506
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,680
Sonic and my best friend, Shadow and Sonic.

00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,180
Does he not keep a photo of his fucking family?

508
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,800
We must stand united to defend our world against these
invaders.

509
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,500
What about his family?

510
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,180
Me and my bestie.

511
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,140

Okay, I thought I had more.

568
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,730
For some reason, it looks...

569
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,650
Looked like I had a lot of ammo.

570
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,730
I don't know why.

571
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,590

Large gun, not large mag.

00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,530
This sounds very evil.

So, I don't know.

662
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,240

00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,020
Alright, guys.

664
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,300

Okay, I thought there was a way...

691

Yeah, it sounds like an overlaid.

00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,440
But I guess this is different rules.

695

853
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:07,980
play both sides.

854
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,080
He doesn't know which side I'm on.

Gotta play both sides.

856
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,780

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,900

1404
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,440

01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,380
I'm sorry.

1411
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:05,160
I'm just not that evil.

1412
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,880
I hope so I tried.

1413
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:15,000
I tried to be evil if I just didn't have it in me.

1414
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,140
Why is being evil?

1415
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:33,300
lot so high why not that evil i was so close it was right
there

1416
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:52,800
i thought i could do it but i was not that evil in the end
i'm just a poser i'm sorry you had to I was just a posy.

1417
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:57,680
Oh my god.

1418
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:02,840
I don't even know where I am anymore.

1419
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,520
Embrace the neutrality.

1420
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:12,190
We know you're evil.

1421
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:15,710
It's just you haven't been able to prove it yet.

1422
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:20,650
It's bad.

1423
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:27,630
evil why it's hard why why is it so hard to be evil

1424
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:37,390
it's too late i've lost all hope on being evil

1425
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:44,990
to be fair neutrality is the true edge lord position

1426
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:52,470
Oh my god, we were so close.

1427
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:55,050
My poor gun.

1428
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:57,710
Oh my god, how?

1429
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:03,130
I almost did it.

1430
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:04,550
We were so close.

1431
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:08,490
I should have called for Maria for help.

1432
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,160
I'm so sad.

1433
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:18,860
We were so close.

1434
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:21,240
Just...

1435
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,060
I found the emerald!

1436
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:29,300
Minecraft is all I need to know, but what kind of bird you
are.

1437
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:32,300
Sonic Man, thank you, Super Chat, thank you, thank you,
Evil?

1438
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,220
Yes, patient?

1439
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:34,320
Apparently not.

1440
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,160
Yeah, but you, Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

1441
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,860
I have to leave it.

1442
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,040
I'm just...

1443
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,760
Just neutral.

1444
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,740
Oh, hey, I got all the Chaos Emeralds, though.

1445
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,120
This makes five Chaos Emeralds.

1446
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,700
Five Chaos Emeralds.

1447
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,820
Ha, ha, ha.

1448
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:03,140
Shadow, the day of reckoning is near.

1449
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:04,380
Spare the President.

1450
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:08,580
I just wanted to show the President something funny.

1451
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:11,340
I could do a good job.

1452
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:12,640
You saved the President.

1453
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,140
I did it, guys.

1454
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,460
I saved the President.

1455
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,860
I finally know who I am.

1456
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:28,660
shadow we seem to have a problem with rats running loose on
the base return immediately to the black comet and

1457
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:40,060
exterminate them the black comet the black comet no you
don't understand the controls are crazy even with the

1458
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:47,960
quality of life this is so hard to control it's actually i
don't know how people did it.

1459
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,760
I actually don't know.

1460
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:54,440
I'm not controlling shadows.

1461
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:56,300
Shadow controls me.

1462
01:35:59,340 --> 01:35:59,940
It can't be...

1463
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:01,920
No, I thought so, too.

1464
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,640
I was like, can't be that bad.

1465
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:06,380
Oh.

1466
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:08,180
There's no neutral.

1467
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:11,480
We've got to get through to the center of the cover.

1468
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:12,680
Alright, where are the people?

1469
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,260
Okay, wait, let's get off this, so...

1470
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,780
So I can do that.

1471
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:22,980
Oh, shit.

1472
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,180
I was in a sludge.

1473
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,860
But that has to be like...

1474
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,960
That stuff down there definitely looks toxic.

1475
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,360
It's time to kill.

1476
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:40,200
It's cool that Knuckles has seen me do the evil route.

1477
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,040
Knuckles like, you're going to be good, right?

1478
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,180
I'm like, yeah.

1479
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:45,400
Sure.

1480
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:50,380
Oh, shit.

1481
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:52,640
I gotta grab this.

1482
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:53,580
It's okay.

1483
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:55,620
Yeah, sure, Knuckles.

1484
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:57,180
I'm gonna do a good thing there.

1485
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:00,640
What?

1486
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:06,160
Yeah, Knuckles gonna watch me commit crime.

1487
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:11,710
Alright, nice.

1488
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:14,830
Wait, wait.

1489
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:16,250

1490
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:17,690
3 out of 48?

1491
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:19,710
Where are they all living?

1492
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:24,770
Go, show them some of the red liquid.

1493
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:26,930
I spin the dash out.

1494
01:37:30,570 --> 01:37:31,510
No, you don't understand.

1495
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:32,310
Don't understand.

1496
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:33,610
It literally went through him.

1497
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:36,190
I...

1498
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:38,230
Go down.

1499
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:39,610
Why down?

1500
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,080

1501
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,420

01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:40,380
I wish I could see.

1586
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:42,540
I assume I killed them all.

1587
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,180
I missed one.

1588
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:50,980
I can't even hit it.

1589
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:53,040
Unless...

1590
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:53,500
Oh!

1591
01:43:58,340 --> 01:43:59,100
Oh!

1592
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:00,920
Where is this area?

1593
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,540
Oh my God.

1594
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:06,900
Oh my God.

1595
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:07,300
Okay.

1596
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:07,840
Alright.

1597
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:09,080
Buckle up.

1598
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,000
Fuck him up.

1599
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,220
Fuck him too.

1600
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:17,660
I can't believe it.

1601
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:18,700
I'm back here.

1602
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:21,320
I'm back here.

1603
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:23,280
I can't believe it.

1604
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,840
I am only here to suffer.

1605
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:27,360
Why?

1606
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:31,600
Why is being evil so high?

1607
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:37,660
Evil shouldn't be this high!

1608
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:44,570
Okay, I'll grab this ammo.

1609
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:48,250
Alright.

1610
01:44:49,710 --> 01:44:50,030
Okay.

1611
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:52,330
We got this, I believe.

1612
01:44:55,010 --> 01:44:56,730
There you see, look, I didn't shoot.

1613
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:59,970
I didn't shoot in between his legs this time.

1614
01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:07,750
How the fuck do I get on top of this?

1615
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:11,430
Like, is there a jump pad nearby?

1616
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:13,650
to get there?

1617
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:16,830
I have no idea.

1618
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:21,510
I'll kill these guys first.

1619
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:23,270
Jesus Christ.

1620
01:45:23,470 --> 01:45:24,110
Okay, that's cool.

1621
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,820
Oh my god, this is so hard to control.

1622
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,260
Is it the teleport?

1623
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:45,330
There's a jump pad in the middle?

1624
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:46,830
There is?

1625
01:45:47,790 --> 01:45:50,690

01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:24,800
There's zero reasoning for me to stop that.

1683
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,200

01:54:00,370 --> 01:54:00,430
Three!

1735
01:54:02,450 --> 01:54:02,890
Oh, shit.

1736
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:08,050
One!

1737
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:10,230
Yay!

1738
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:16,010
We did it!

1739
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:20,070
Let the humans await their final judgment day.

1740
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:21,230
That's right.

1741
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:28,260
E for evil.

1742
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,800
Well done, Shadow.

1743
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:32,360
We did it.

1744
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,480
E for evil.

1745
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:41,380
Oh, hey, Sonic.

1746
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:42,000
Where were you?

1747
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:43,280
We did it.

1748
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,440
We saved humanity.

1749
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:45,280
I can't let you go.

1750
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:46,460
Not like this.

1751
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:50,940
You, you're the one who destroyed the Ark and killed
everyone.

1752
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:53,900
It's time to settle this once and for all.

1753
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:54,940
I destroyed the Ark?

1754
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:57,340
What happened?

1755
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,980
But they were evil.

1756
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:02,380
I was born to bring order to the humans.

1757
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,420
These humans, they don't value life.

1758
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:06,760
They're going to pay.

1759
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,560
I did it, I saved the Latinas!

1760
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:09,720
What they've done.

1761
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:12,520
Shadow now kills Sonic.

Oh, God.

1809
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:40,670
Oh, God.

1810
01:58:40,930 --> 01:58:41,470
Oh, no.

1811
01:58:44,030 --> 01:58:45,270
Oh, no, what is he doing?

1812
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:48,050
Bro is gapping.

1813
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:51,350
Sonic, your friend's not going to your big friend's not
going to help you forever.

1814
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:56,690
Oh, shit.

1815
01:58:57,810 --> 01:58:57,850
Okay.

1816
01:59:02,810 --> 01:59:04,610
Are you kidding me?

1817
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:07,650
I pulled.

1818
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:12,530
Oh, that's right.

1819
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:19,050
Explose!

1820
01:59:21,010 --> 01:59:21,670
Chaos!

1821
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:22,950
This works.

1822
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:24,610
This works too.

1823
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:28,250
This works too.

1824
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:28,690
This works.

1825
01:59:31,190 --> 01:59:31,570
Alright.

1826
01:59:35,210 --> 01:59:35,970
Okay.

1827
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:36,490
Okay, it's fine.

1828
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:39,770
I just gotta keep doing evil.

1829
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:42,810
Sonic, please.

1830
01:59:43,150 --> 01:59:44,510
Sonic, please!

1831
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:49,970
I know, you and I just hanging out with you and your big
brother.

1832
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:52,470
Your big brother can't save you forever.

1833
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:56,450
Come on.

1834
01:59:56,930 --> 01:59:57,970
Get over here.

1835
01:59:58,070 --> 01:59:58,490
Get over here.

1836
01:59:58,590 --> 01:59:58,930
Sonic?

1837
01:59:59,330 --> 01:59:59,770
Sonic?

1838
02:00:00,210 --> 02:00:00,510
Sonic?

1839
02:00:00,990 --> 02:00:01,910
Sonic, please.

1840
02:00:02,610 --> 02:00:03,990
Sonic, come on.

1841
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:06,710
Sonic, come on.

1842
02:00:07,610 --> 02:00:08,750
Sonic, please.

1843
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:11,550
Please, you gotta work with me here, bro.

1844
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:12,810
You gotta...

1845
02:00:13,150 --> 02:00:15,850
You gotta fucking work with me, bro.

1846
02:00:16,410 --> 02:00:19,110
Like, honest, bro, I'm so mad.

1847
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:23,070
Sonic doesn't even care.

1848
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:26,250
Sonic, please.

1849
02:00:28,090 --> 02:00:28,930
There we go.

1850
02:00:28,990 --> 02:00:29,350
There we go.

1851
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:30,090
There we go.

1852
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:32,830
There we go.

1853
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:33,350
There we go.

1854
02:00:33,590 --> 02:00:35,930
Sonic, you're like my little jump bat.

1855
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:38,350
This is so dumb.

1856
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:39,750
Oh, my God.

1857
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:43,130
I can't believe this game didn't get a sequel, guys.

1858
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:57,670
I wonder why I I wonder why this game never got a sequel I
why didn't we why wasn't this game ever remastered who would

1859
02:00:57,670 --> 02:01:10,470
have thought we'll never know the world's greatest mysteries
truly a mystery in the Sonic fandom

1860
02:01:16,650 --> 02:01:18,170
Jesus Christ.

1861
02:01:18,850 --> 02:01:21,450
This is so dumb.

1862
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:25,510
Hold still, you double.

1863
02:01:29,010 --> 02:01:30,230
Get out of here.

1864
02:01:30,450 --> 02:01:31,410
Fuck you, Sonic!

1865
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:36,290
Hey, I love this game when I was a child.

1866
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:38,310
Hold still, you double.

1867
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:41,210
Oh my god, not again.

1868
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:42,970

Okay, I just gotta hit him one more time to do it.

1874
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:20,770
Hold still, you double.

Sonic!

1881
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:29,070
I thought we had it.

1882
02:02:29,190 --> 02:02:29,790
There we go.

1883
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:32,470
It's time to end this.

1884
02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:33,530
There we go.

1885
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:38,550
There we go.

1886
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:41,190
I just gotta beat up Sonic a couple of times.

1887
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:46,270
Yay!

1888
02:02:47,210 --> 02:02:48,950
We came over.

1889
02:02:51,810 --> 02:02:53,510
We did it.

1890
02:02:53,890 --> 02:02:54,510
Evil!

1891
02:02:57,690 --> 02:03:01,010
Congratulations, Toki, you killed Sonic.

1892
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:02,290
Yay!

1893
02:03:03,210 --> 02:03:03,950
Oh no!

1894
02:03:04,270 --> 02:03:05,330
That's right!

1895
02:03:06,070 --> 02:03:07,790
Should have stood in my path, Sonic!

1896
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:23,380
Finally, I've got all the Chaos Emeralds.

1897
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:24,540
We did it!

1898
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:41,400
how could you shadow thought we were best friends forever

the dark lord black doom satan of these chaos emeralds this

1900
02:03:51,300 --> 02:04:08,020
world will become I am we did it we saved the world what the
fuck was that wait that's how it is bro what the fuck was

1901
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:15,300
the laughing animation we did it guys we saved the world yay

1902
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:24,700
what an ending I mean if he's happy it's technically a good
ending

1903
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:30,740
Bro, what happened?

1904
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,300
Also, who the fuck was Maria then?

1905
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:38,100
Clearly Maria was not that important.

1906
02:04:57,350 --> 02:04:59,530
I need three endings?

1907
02:04:59,870 --> 02:05:00,250
Okay, what?

1908
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:02,470
The three is neutral and good, right?

1909
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:10,280
Oh, it's...

1910
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:15,640
a different story path to see the ending okay we can get two
of the other endings and then that will unlock the true

1911
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:22,520
ending right yeah but reloaded we could just do three to get
the true ending which is a lot better than 10.

1912
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:29,740
i don't know three is a lot less now for the other six
endings

1913
02:05:51,500 --> 02:06:02,320
yeah i feel like i'm missing like 50 actually not even 50 i
feel like i missed 80 of the story i i was like doing evil

1914
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:06,520
task and then i fought sonic and this other guy who i don't
even know

1915
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:11,440
like his big brother.

1916
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:13,680
I was like, what happened to the president?

1917
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:15,540
Like, what happened?

1918
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:17,300
I'm so confused.

1919
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:22,980
And I'm like, what happened to Igman?

1920
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:26,340
He just left.

1921
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:36,760
But no, no, no, no.

1922
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:38,280

02:06:43,350 --> 02:06:43,430
no.

1924
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:47,530
But no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1925
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:58,370
A lot of it happened in Sonic Adventure 2 or just wasn't
explained.

1926
02:06:58,710 --> 02:07:03,730
Black Doom is Shadow's genetic dad and wants his son to help
him destroy Earth because he's evil.

1927
02:07:04,030 --> 02:07:05,750
Wait, my dad's a human?

1928
02:07:06,330 --> 02:07:07,850
He fucked a hedgehog?

1929
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:09,190

1933
02:07:12,350 --> 02:07:16,250
Like, wait, is Black Doom a hedgehog or a human?

1934
02:07:19,790 --> 02:07:20,270
Yeah?

1935
02:07:21,010 --> 02:07:21,010

2035
02:16:12,470 --> 02:16:13,830
I don't want to.

2036
02:16:15,550 --> 02:16:17,270
I don't want to.

2037
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:20,430
Touch the drawer.

2038
02:16:24,430 --> 02:16:26,710
I don't want to touch it.

2039
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:28,350
It's bad.

2040
02:16:29,210 --> 02:16:30,610
It's a bad drawer.

2041
02:16:32,430 --> 02:16:32,990
Woo!

2042
02:16:33,090 --> 02:16:34,740
You must touch it.

2043
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:44,960
Ignoring your father is a neutral way to do it.

2044
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:46,960
Touch the jewel.

2045
02:16:47,480 --> 02:16:48,660
Alright, there we go.

2046
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:50,740

2047
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:51,600
Yay!

2048
02:16:57,800 --> 02:16:59,420
We did it!

2049
02:16:59,660 --> 02:16:59,880
I don't take orders from anyone.

2050
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:01,700
I do as I decide.

2051
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:04,200
That's right.

2052
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:06,400
I don't take orders from anyone.

2053
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:11,060
That's why I don't have the jewel's consent.

2054
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:11,780
No, I don't...

2055
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:13,860
What if the jewel didn't want me to touch it?

2056
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:16,480
I didn't know that.

2057
02:17:19,140 --> 02:17:21,060
Excellent neutral victory.

2058
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:26,000
It's like that Futurama video where you're like, well, how
do you feel?

2059
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,300
I don't feel neither...

2060
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:29,840
Like, what do you say?

2061
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:31,740
The Futurama neutral people?

2062
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:39,360
I feel neither joy or sadness for this decision.

2063
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:44,470
Tell my wife.

2064
02:17:45,550 --> 02:17:47,990
I wonder if there are any chaos emeralds around here.

2065
02:17:49,710 --> 02:17:52,050
I know this place.

2066
02:17:52,250 --> 02:17:53,530
Gotta get grand.

2067
02:17:55,650 --> 02:17:56,190
Oh yeah.

2068
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:57,590
If I do more good.

2069
02:17:58,210 --> 02:17:59,730
I'll skip the stuff for me.

2070
02:18:02,850 --> 02:18:03,970
Oh please.

2071
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:06,870
Please.

2072
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:08,530
I gotta do the good stuff.

2073
02:18:13,210 --> 02:18:14,270
Ah fuck.

2074
02:18:15,710 --> 02:18:16,790
Charmy, please!

2075
02:18:18,210 --> 02:18:18,390
Okay.

2076
02:18:20,930 --> 02:18:23,790
Oh my god, there is no way I was gonna get all this get

2077
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:25,130

02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:29,790
Charmy, I need to go fucking get another crystal.

2080
02:18:31,190 --> 02:18:33,530
I gotta be neutral again, Charmy.

2081
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:34,510
Whee!

2082
02:18:38,170 --> 02:18:42,410
That's crazy that there's no hero select.

2083
02:18:42,830 --> 02:18:45,070
That's actually the crazy thing.

2084
02:18:45,090 --> 02:18:57,230
is like not here there's no level select for the endings as
i'm i'm actually so amazed by that that that was the concept

2085
02:18:57,230 --> 02:18:59,120
that they decided not to add

2086
02:19:04,510 --> 02:19:18,930
but that's the best part toky yeah yeah yeah yeah what do i

Okay, it's not that far.

2102
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:16,170
Back down, I go.

2103
02:20:17,210 --> 02:20:26,350
The thing is, I followed the path, but it went so fast that
I fucking it's like, you know, it's like my fear on water

2104
02:20:26,350 --> 02:20:29,010
slides Like you're going so fast that you slip off the
slide.

2105
02:20:29,610 --> 02:20:36,310
That's literally my greatest fear I never do water slides
because of that if it's not I don't understand people who

2106
02:20:36,310 --> 02:20:46,150
can do water slides where it's not fully enclosed That's the
point That's the thrill of it, Toki I

2107
02:20:49,350 --> 02:20:50,470
All right, here we go.

2108
02:20:52,650 --> 02:20:53,890
Yes, we got a checkpoint.

2109
02:20:58,490 --> 02:20:59,450
It's okay.

2110
02:21:00,510 --> 02:21:01,050
Wee!

2111
02:21:01,050 --> 02:21:01,590

2112
02:21:03,210 --> 02:21:03,750
Neutra!

2113
02:21:07,070 --> 02:21:08,150
It was...

2114
02:21:08,150 --> 02:21:10,090
My sister and I almost slipped off.

2115
02:21:10,290 --> 02:21:11,550
It was pretty fun.

2116
02:21:12,150 --> 02:21:13,730
But that was so terrifying.

2117
02:21:19,420 --> 02:21:20,180
All right, here we go.

2118
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:20,620

2119
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:21,340
Neutra!

2120
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:25,640
No, this is a new cutscene, because I also did neutral on
this, too.

2121
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,560
We did neutral on this one.

2122
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:33,000
See, because we were like, why the fuck is Dr. Eggman here?

2123

02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:45,840
All right.

2129
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:50,320

Have you tried...

2197
02:26:05,960 --> 02:26:07,340
In a Sonic game?

2198
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,640

2199
02:26:10,860 --> 02:26:12,220
Kratos with a gun.

2200
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:15,660

2201
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:19,480
Alright.

2202
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:21,220

02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:27,640
Alright, here I go.

02:26:39,980 --> 02:26:43,180
You might be at the support of him to your dad, but I'm
still here.

There we go.

2212
02:26:56,850 --> 02:26:57,470

Despise.

2238
02:28:41,310 --> 02:28:42,390

2285
02:32:41,780 --> 02:32:42,840

I can't tell.

2296
02:33:13,060 --> 02:33:14,180
Am I shooting him?

Oh my god, I hate the shadow bots.

2374
02:37:47,080 --> 02:37:50,020
I hate it because all I have are fucking bazookas.

2375
02:37:50,340 --> 02:37:52,760
The bazookas are so hard to aim!

2376
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:55,800
That's it.

2377
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:58,300

Alright, we did it.

There we go, we did it.

I truly am the ultimate lifeblood.

2385
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:20,560
Yay!

2386
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:24,600

2445
02:41:44,250 --> 02:41:45,630

And he died.

2451
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:06,180
Oh.

2452
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:09,240
I must be the android Dr. Eggman created.

2453
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:14,360
Then it's clear what needs to be done.

2454
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:20,060
You're going straight to the place you created me from.

2455
02:42:20,600 --> 02:42:20,900
What?

2456
02:42:21,340 --> 02:42:21,940

2457
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:22,800
Where are we going?

2458
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:25,720
Shadow is dead?

I am so fucking confused.

2461
02:42:37,460 --> 02:42:39,000
It's okay, I'm shredding it though.

2462
02:42:39,100 --> 02:42:39,880
I look so cool.

2463
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:48,090
I might be confused, but I oh shit I didn't realize I didn't
realize like I thought this was just this

2464
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:58,040
Alright, what is the what does he want?

2465
02:42:58,800 --> 02:43:03,240
Activate the volcanic defense system Head to the center.

2466
02:43:03,560 --> 02:43:07,120
Okay head to the center that's wait, but there's no neutral.

2467
02:43:07,580 --> 02:43:10,060
Wait, how do I be neutral then?

2468
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:17,240
Terrain indicates triangle jump is the most suitable way to
proceed.

2469
02:43:18,460 --> 02:43:19,520
Triangle jump.

2470
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:23,200
Wee.

2471
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:25,380
Okay.

2472
02:43:27,340 --> 02:43:28,300
Wee.

2473
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,580
Wee.

2474
02:43:30,620 --> 02:43:32,660
Oh, both are neutral.

2475
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:33,120
Okay.

2476
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:41,240
I was confused because I was like, how neutral is If both
were good, bad.

2477
02:43:42,520 --> 02:43:43,580
Wait, what's the non-neut?

2478
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:46,340
All right, do we help Omega?

2479
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:46,920
Do we help?

2480
02:43:47,020 --> 02:43:48,060
Wait, they're both neutral?

2481
02:43:48,620 --> 02:43:49,600
So it doesn't matter?

2482
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:56,960
Wait, why is like Dr. Igman helping me?

2483
02:43:59,060 --> 02:43:59,880
Help Omega?

2484
02:44:00,140 --> 02:44:00,300
Okay.

2485
02:44:00,960 --> 02:44:01,700
We'll help Omega.

2486
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:03,260
We gotta find the center.

2487
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:04,780
Wherever that is.

2488
02:44:08,140 --> 02:44:10,940
Now, I'm helping Omega.

2489
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:14,160
Omega's a homie.

2490
02:44:14,840 --> 02:44:15,420
That's right.

2491
02:44:17,980 --> 02:44:20,120
I think I'm helping him.

2492
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:26,200
At least the music is sick as hell.

2493
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:33,060
I don't know where I'm going, but I think I'm going the
right way.

2494
02:44:39,590 --> 02:44:39,950
Why?

2495
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:43,550
Where am I?

2496
02:44:44,010 --> 02:44:44,610
Oh, where?

2497
02:44:45,170 --> 02:44:47,490
I don't know where I'm going.

2498
02:44:47,870 --> 02:44:48,810
I don't know.

2499
02:44:49,150 --> 02:44:51,150
There's so many things in this level.

2500
02:44:59,120 --> 02:44:59,460
No!

2501
02:45:04,650 --> 02:45:05,870
I refuse!

2502
02:45:08,970 --> 02:45:10,470
I must head to the center.

2503
02:45:10,590 --> 02:45:11,690
You can't stop me.

2504
02:45:12,070 --> 02:45:13,350
You're not my real dad.

2505
02:45:14,990 --> 02:45:16,250
My real dad's Satan.

2506
02:45:16,810 --> 02:45:21,360
Shadow Android's shattered armament includes some very
relentless lock-on missiles.

2507
02:45:22,570 --> 02:45:23,090
Alright.

2508
02:45:24,430 --> 02:45:26,190
There you go.

2509
02:45:28,130 --> 02:45:28,830
Now!

2510
02:45:32,410 --> 02:45:33,190
Dad.

2511
02:45:34,870 --> 02:45:38,090
Shadow, how come Sega lets you have two dads?

2512
02:45:40,370 --> 02:45:41,610
Briding it?

2513
02:45:44,310 --> 02:45:45,750
Alright, nice.

2514
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:46,790
I'm treading.

2515
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:47,490
I'm shredding.

2516
02:45:48,910 --> 02:45:50,590
I'm looking sick as hell right now.

2517
02:45:53,110 --> 02:45:55,350
Oh, Tony Hawk is quiet now.

2518
02:45:56,430 --> 02:45:57,130
Let me go.

2519
02:45:59,730 --> 02:45:59,810
Whoops.

2520
02:46:02,230 --> 02:46:05,430
Okay, maybe don't fucking put bombs there.

2521
02:46:07,110 --> 02:46:08,170
So cool.

2522
02:46:08,590 --> 02:46:09,830
You're still ahead of your time.

2523
02:46:10,710 --> 02:46:11,210
Let me go.

2524
02:46:12,830 --> 02:46:14,210
I'm so fucking fast.

2525
02:46:16,350 --> 02:46:16,610
Wham!

2526
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:19,350
Oh my god, gotta go fast.

2527
02:46:19,850 --> 02:46:20,490
Gotta go fast!

2528
02:46:21,650 --> 02:46:22,770
Gotta go so fast!

2529
02:46:24,330 --> 02:46:26,210
Damn, not here.

2530
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:33,020
Oh, I got it.

2531
02:46:35,800 --> 02:46:38,100
It went too fast.

2532
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:41,300
No, it works.

2533
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:42,000
It works.

2534
02:46:42,300 --> 02:46:44,020
At the last, I'll hear the truth from you.

2535
02:46:45,660 --> 02:46:48,940
Guys, apparently there's a thing called too fast.

2536
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:50,960
They took pity on you.

2537
02:46:50,980 --> 02:46:57,700
Yeah, I think the reason I put a checkpoint there that
people might have went too fast too many times

2538
02:47:01,900 --> 02:47:11,180
All right Nice to see you shadow android and you too omega
it certainly looks as if you've well done quite a bit of

2539
02:47:11,180 --> 02:47:16,340
damage down there But did you really think that you could
challenge me?

2540
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:23,780
Damn, right I will destroy you and reign supreme Yes,
doctor.

2541
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:26,260
You will regret ever having created me.

2542
02:47:26,620 --> 02:47:28,280
You're going straight to hell.

2543
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:29,260
Whoa!

2544
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,940
Can't say that.

2545
02:47:33,700 --> 02:47:33,840
Whoa!

2546
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:35,420
Shadow!

2547
02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:38,800
Hell exists in the Sonic universe?

2548
02:47:40,060 --> 02:47:44,840
I'll turn both of you into Scrap with my greatest and
greatest invention.

2549
02:47:45,980 --> 02:47:48,680
Yeah, Shadow wants to commit murder!

What in other words, by stopping the third reel yourself you
can deal an attack against Edmund.

2554
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:40,570
Oh no, I hit myself

2555
02:48:45,950 --> 02:48:47,030

02:48:47,730 --> 02:48:48,910

That's fine.

2560
02:49:02,090 --> 02:49:02,830
That's fine.

2561
02:49:04,710 --> 02:49:05,590

2567
02:49:32,330 --> 02:49:32,390
We got it.

2568
02:49:32,390 --> 02:49:33,390
We got it.

2569
02:49:33,390 --> 02:49:51,370

02:50:09,050 --> 02:50:09,350
That's fine.

2574
02:50:10,250 --> 02:50:10,890
Okay, I got one.

2575
02:50:11,090 --> 02:50:11,490
That's fine.

2576
02:50:11,790 --> 02:50:12,770
That's fine.

2577
02:50:13,850 --> 02:50:15,830
Get this out of my hand.

2578
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:18,570
The least annoying punch.

2579
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:20,870
Is this hurt him?

2580
02:50:25,750 --> 02:50:26,250
Okay.

2581
02:50:26,750 --> 02:50:27,730
That's fine, that's fine.

2582
02:50:29,750 --> 02:50:31,430
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

2583
02:50:31,830 --> 02:50:32,090
It's okay, it's okay.

2584
02:50:33,950 --> 02:50:35,470
It really is.

2585
02:50:35,990 --> 02:50:38,050
Not boss, fight of the century.

2586
02:50:38,650 --> 02:50:40,150
Oh my god, let me...

2587
02:50:43,490 --> 02:50:44,610
Are you...

2588
02:50:45,650 --> 02:50:46,550
It's okay.

2589
02:50:48,230 --> 02:50:49,410
What did he do?

2590
02:50:50,310 --> 02:50:51,190
What happened?

2591
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:56,370
Let's go.

2592
02:50:57,330 --> 02:50:58,370
Does it hurt me?

2593
02:51:00,010 --> 02:51:01,370
Wait, what's shadow fever?

2594
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:02,790
Oh, that's right!

2595
02:51:04,390 --> 02:51:05,250
That's right!

2596
02:51:05,370 --> 02:51:05,950
Get over here!

2597
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:06,850
Get over here!

2598
02:51:06,870 --> 02:51:09,070
Get over here, get over here, get over here, get over here.

2599
02:51:09,070 --> 02:51:09,950
Oh, I got shot.

2600
02:51:10,090 --> 02:51:10,550
No!

2601
02:51:10,790 --> 02:51:11,510
I'm not here.

2602
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:16,370
I'll turn both of you into scrap with the greatest and
greatest invention.

2603
02:51:16,870 --> 02:51:18,490
Final targets confirmed.

2604
02:51:19,190 --> 02:51:20,290
Commencing combat.

2605
02:51:26,540 --> 02:51:27,120
No!

2606
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:29,380
No!

2607
02:51:30,900 --> 02:51:33,980
No, he can't do this to me.

2608
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:38,640
My green.

2609
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:42,220
Oh, my greed!

2610
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:46,460
Oh, no!

2611
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:50,240
Why am I so greedy?

2612
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:51,960
Why?

2613
02:51:54,520 --> 02:51:55,400
Why?

2614
02:52:00,400 --> 02:52:03,260
Why am I so greedy?

2615
02:52:04,200 --> 02:52:08,800
In other words, by stopping the third real user, you can
deal with it.

2616
02:52:09,940 --> 02:52:11,140
I hate him.

2617
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:12,820
I hate him so much.

2618
02:52:15,860 --> 02:52:16,460
Damn.

2619
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:17,480
Not here.

2620
02:52:18,080 --> 02:52:19,980
I'll turn both of you into scratch.

2621
02:52:20,380 --> 02:52:20,920
Oh my god.

2622
02:52:21,240 --> 02:52:23,260
I have to watch this intro.

2623
02:52:23,660 --> 02:52:26,760
I have to watch this intro every time.

2624
02:52:29,300 --> 02:52:31,480
Why is it one hit, one kill?

2625
02:52:38,770 --> 02:52:39,370
Why?

2626
02:52:48,890 --> 02:53:00,390
okay that's fine I thought I thought I don't know for some
reason in my head I thought I'd be okay I just I don't know

2627
02:53:00,390 --> 02:53:06,590
why I don't know why I thought I'd be okay there I hate him
I hate him so much

2628
02:53:14,310 --> 02:53:16,790
You can deal an attack against Eggman.

2629
02:53:17,090 --> 02:53:17,790
Come on.

2630
02:53:19,050 --> 02:53:20,190
Are you fucking kidding me?

2631
02:53:20,530 --> 02:53:21,810
Sonic legs touch me!

2632
02:53:26,060 --> 02:53:27,100
Oh my god.

2633
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:31,460
Oh my god.

2634
02:53:31,620 --> 02:53:33,000
We almost got Shadowfest.

2635
02:53:33,180 --> 02:53:37,120
You need a short kind of weapon to strike an Eggman's
cockpit.

2636
02:53:37,940 --> 02:53:38,600
There you go.

2637
02:53:39,980 --> 02:53:41,620
My beautiful range!

2638
02:53:42,060 --> 02:53:42,360
Oh!

2639
02:53:43,160 --> 02:53:45,880

Get over here.

2650
02:54:08,220 --> 02:54:09,060
Shadow Fever!

2651
02:54:09,320 --> 02:54:10,080
It's Shadow Fever!

2652
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:15,080
Oh my god, you fucker!

2653
02:54:15,360 --> 02:54:16,140

02:54:36,960 --> 02:54:49,800
he is the egg man he's got the master plan I tried to take
you but this is the end for you so we did it neutrally we

2657
02:54:49,800 --> 02:54:54,420
did it e for e neutral we're equal

2658
02:55:03,170 --> 02:55:05,410
that's right look what I got.

2659
02:55:07,770 --> 02:55:08,970
Got you, Jim.

02:55:15,070 --> 02:55:16,710
He for Igman.

2662
02:55:17,370 --> 02:55:19,890
Finally, I've got all the chaos emeralds.

2663
02:55:21,530 --> 02:55:22,670
I made you.

2664
02:55:23,310 --> 02:55:25,730
And this is how you repay me.

2665
02:55:25,810 --> 02:55:27,530
I mean, you try to kill me first.

2666
02:55:28,570 --> 02:55:28,590
Shadow Ash.

2667
02:55:29,710 --> 02:55:30,430
The ultimate battle life form.

2668
02:55:30,830 --> 02:55:32,790
The ultimate battle life form.

2669
02:55:32,990 --> 02:55:34,550
What the fuck is this game?

2670
02:55:34,710 --> 02:55:40,270
But I will now leave this empire and androids will rule this
is who I am

2671
02:55:43,370 --> 02:55:46,550
It's surprising this isn't one game of the year.

2672
02:55:46,970 --> 02:55:55,430
He's so cool goodbye doctor Wait, I killed Why

2673
02:56:02,690 --> 02:56:15,510
Oh my god, did I just kill dr Because if only this was the
true ending guys rip fatality honestly this should have

2674
02:56:15,510 --> 02:56:23,510
imagine if like this in this game we just kill off Eggman
and he just never shows up again yeah he killed yeah he

2675
02:56:23,510 --> 02:56:37,690
killed his dad that's next maximum edgy this bro Eggman's
fucking dead he just killed Jim Carrey you skip the song

2676
02:56:37,690 --> 02:56:41,270
wait would have been a new song or is it the same song.

2677
02:56:42,570 --> 02:56:44,030
Oh, what the?

2678
02:56:44,450 --> 02:56:46,860
I thought!

2679
02:56:47,820 --> 02:56:52,400
Oh, I thought it was the same song, so I skipped it.

2680
02:56:54,660 --> 02:56:55,700
Are you serious?

2681
02:56:55,900 --> 02:56:58,820
Each ending has a new... Okay, well, just... It's okay.

2682
02:56:59,000 --> 02:56:59,280
It's okay.

2683
02:56:59,320 --> 02:57:00,460
I got an idea, guys.

2684
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:01,660
I got an idea.

2685
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:02,460
Don't worry.

2686
02:57:03,100 --> 02:57:03,700
Don't worry.

2687
02:57:03,780 --> 02:57:04,980
It's like I never skipped it.

2688
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:06,140
I didn't know!

2689
02:57:06,460 --> 02:57:08,640
I thought each song was the same.

2690
02:57:09,320 --> 02:57:11,580
Oh, I could... Wait, I can listen to it in the settings?

2691
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:14,020
Okay, wait, let me check.

2692
02:57:14,740 --> 02:57:17,820
Also, also, guys, tickets are out now.

2693
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:24,820
Tickets for Made Cafe out now.

2694
02:57:25,380 --> 02:57:27,960
For those who want to still grab the live tickets.

2695
02:57:28,860 --> 02:57:30,280
Wait, can I still listen to it?

2696
02:57:30,880 --> 02:57:31,620
Wait, let me try.

2697
02:57:33,420 --> 02:57:34,360
Let me see.

2698
02:57:35,280 --> 02:57:37,180
I must be able to listen to it, right?

2699
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:38,240
In the...

2700
02:57:38,240 --> 02:57:39,020
I...

2701
02:57:39,020 --> 02:57:39,800
I...

2702
02:57:39,800 --> 02:57:40,700
I...

2703
02:57:41,660 --> 02:57:42,180
I...

2704
02:57:42,340 --> 02:57:44,340
Wait, uh...

2705
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:46,480
Wait, am I re-watching this?

2706
02:57:46,540 --> 02:57:47,800
Oh, wait, that's not what I want it.

2707
02:57:48,560 --> 02:57:49,820
Is it in the library?

2708
02:57:50,140 --> 02:57:50,940
Wait, is it?

2709
02:57:52,180 --> 02:57:52,900
Wait, no?

2710
02:57:54,620 --> 02:57:58,860
I think this just shows all the cutscenes for that area.

2711
02:57:59,440 --> 02:57:59,680
Right?

2712
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:01,120
Yeah, it does.

2713
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:01,780
It shows...

2714
02:58:01,780 --> 02:58:02,300
Oh, my God.

2715
02:58:02,400 --> 02:58:03,260
Take me out of here.

2716
02:58:03,560 --> 02:58:05,900
Take me out of here.

2717
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:09,120
Alright, let's see if I can listen to it in.

2718
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:10,900
Oh, my God.

2719
02:58:10,960 --> 02:58:11,780
There's select...

2720
02:58:11,780 --> 02:58:12,320
Oh, my God.

2721
02:58:12,340 --> 02:58:12,760
Oh my god.

2722
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:14,020
Wait, okay.

2723
02:58:15,280 --> 02:58:16,420
Which one is it?

2724
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:20,700
Guys, which one is it?

2725
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:22,780
Or the song name?

2726
02:58:26,140 --> 02:58:28,000
There's event, is it event three?

2727
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:30,700
Waking up?

2728
02:58:32,660 --> 02:58:33,560
Oh, is this?

2729
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:38,600
Oh, I don't know.

2730
02:58:40,380 --> 02:58:40,700
Oh.

2731
02:58:58,340 --> 02:58:58,900
Oh.

2732
02:58:59,120 --> 02:58:59,160
Oh.

2733
02:58:59,300 --> 02:58:59,340
Oh.

2734
02:58:59,340 --> 02:58:59,460
Oh.

2735
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:07,740
That's the one thing we can always count on for Sonic games.

2736
02:59:08,700 --> 02:59:10,700
The songs are just fucking sick as hell.

2737
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:25,180
That's one thing they get right every time.

2738
02:59:25,820 --> 02:59:29,620
You know what other Sonic game I've been wanting to play for
the longest time?

2739
02:59:36,660 --> 02:59:48,160
It's a Sonic Boom But I researched it And it's almost
impossible to get to play It's almost impossible to make it

2740
02:59:48,160 --> 02:59:49,680
work on modern PCs

2741
02:59:54,580 --> 03:00:00,820
It's the one game I've wanted to play for the longest time
Yeah, it's the most broken Sonic game

2742
03:00:07,180 --> 03:00:16,620
it's that yeah apparently like there's no way to like mod it
in a way where you can actually make it run on pc like

2743
03:00:16,620 --> 03:00:24,080
modders gave up they were like we can't do it alien like i'm
sorry we can't do it

2744
03:00:36,880 --> 03:00:43,240
i don't know

2745
03:01:01,770 --> 03:01:02,970
Cannon Castle Runner?

2746
03:01:03,070 --> 03:01:03,530
Yeah, the Wii.

2747
03:01:03,810 --> 03:01:04,550
It was originally made.

2748
03:01:04,710 --> 03:01:06,130
Wasn't it originally made for the Wii?

2749
03:01:08,570 --> 03:01:13,290
But even then, like, modders have made it work on, like,
other...

2750
03:01:15,190 --> 03:01:16,650
Was it originally on the Wii U?

2751
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:17,210
Yeah.

2752
03:01:17,670 --> 03:01:23,470
The modders have made Wii U games work on PC, but everyone
gave up on Sonic Boom.

2753
03:01:24,890 --> 03:01:28,910
Not even the most dedicated Sonic fan can make it work.

2754
03:01:29,070 --> 03:01:34,930
is saying a lot because Sonic has a lot of dedicated fans.

2755
03:01:37,210 --> 03:01:45,450
Literally a fan, literally a fan made the reloaded, like
literally made this much so that Sonic, the Shadow the

2756
03:01:45,450 --> 03:01:48,630
Hedgehog would be a playable game on PC.

2757
03:01:54,480 --> 03:01:54,620
Yay.

2758
03:01:59,180 --> 03:02:02,880
All right, let's go, or it's good, it's time to be good now.

2759
03:02:10,680 --> 03:02:22,360

2761
03:02:36,160 --> 03:02:37,580
Okay, it's just one map.

2762
03:02:37,900 --> 03:02:38,920
Okay, here we go again.

2763
03:02:39,780 --> 03:02:40,420
Here we go.

2764
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:41,720
Here we go again.

2765
03:02:41,980 --> 03:02:42,660
It's okay, guys.

2766
03:02:42,760 --> 03:02:43,540
We can do this.

2767
03:02:43,780 --> 03:02:45,160
I believe in us.

2768
03:02:45,960 --> 03:02:47,540
Here we go again.

2769
03:02:47,660 --> 03:02:49,240
All right, we aim for good.

2770
03:02:49,440 --> 03:02:50,600
Right off the bat.

2771
03:02:51,060 --> 03:02:53,200
Here we go again.

2772
03:02:55,840 --> 03:02:58,000
We gotta finish the story.

2773
03:02:59,660 --> 03:02:59,880
All right.

2774
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:03,480
All right, we gotta kill 40.

2775
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:05,100
Oh, shit.

2776
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:06,520
we go again.

2777
03:03:12,300 --> 03:03:16,560
We got this, and then we can unlock the true ending
afterwards.

2778
03:03:18,680 --> 03:03:19,360
Don't worry, Sonic.

2779
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:21,760
I'm here for good now.

2780
03:03:23,180 --> 03:03:23,920
There we go.

2781
03:03:24,720 --> 03:03:24,980
Alright.

2782
03:03:25,140 --> 03:03:26,920
I'm here for good, but I need your gun.

2783
03:03:27,020 --> 03:03:27,680
Give me a sec.

2784
03:03:28,420 --> 03:03:31,140
I swear to God, it's for very good reasons.

2785
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:36,100
He'll understand.

2786
03:03:36,320 --> 03:03:37,540
He's dying for his country.

2787
03:03:39,980 --> 03:03:43,330
Okay, like if I'm a good person, you shouldn't be hurting me

2788
03:03:47,140 --> 03:03:58,600
All right, we gotta go slow because I gotta know which ones

Oh, shit.

2793
03:04:11,120 --> 03:04:11,860
You're not dead yet.

2794
03:04:12,080 --> 03:04:12,200
Bupu.

2795

03:16:26,600 --> 03:16:27,640
Especially from you.

2994
03:16:28,300 --> 03:16:29,820
But I'm not here to fight you either.

2995
03:16:30,760 --> 03:16:33,200
I'm collecting the emeralds to find my own answers.

2996
03:16:33,560 --> 03:16:35,060
So why don't you just back off?

2997
03:16:36,660 --> 03:16:39,940
See, the moment I started being good, Sonic started
following me.

2998
03:16:40,360 --> 03:16:42,060
Because he's like, being good is cool.

2999
03:16:49,960 --> 03:16:51,720
What the fuck?

3000
03:16:52,120 --> 03:16:55,140

3001
03:16:57,200 --> 03:16:59,800
Um, Sonic, we're about to fucking die.

3002
03:17:00,160 --> 03:17:01,700
Black Bull.

3003
03:17:06,060 --> 03:17:06,920
That is wild.

3004
03:17:09,680 --> 03:17:10,640
What am I supposed to do?

3005
03:17:13,120 --> 03:17:15,080
Sonic, Sonic, you wanted this fight.

3006
03:17:21,530 --> 03:17:23,430
What the fuck is his weak spot?

3007
03:17:23,670 --> 03:17:25,270
I don't fucking know Sonic.

3008
03:17:30,160 --> 03:17:32,840
Sonic, what is his weak spot?

3009
03:17:33,180 --> 03:17:33,360
Hit it?

3010
03:17:33,480 --> 03:17:34,480
Do I just hit it?

3011
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:38,480
Oh, I'm so fucking fast.

3012
03:17:41,460 --> 03:17:42,740
I can't touch him.

3013
03:17:43,400 --> 03:17:44,900
I legitimately just can't touch him.

3014
03:17:46,100 --> 03:17:46,540
I guess what?

3015
03:17:46,700 --> 03:17:47,680

3016
03:17:50,100 --> 03:17:51,500

3168
03:28:46,730 --> 03:28:51,130
No, I don't!

3169
03:28:53,870 --> 03:28:57,550
Oh my gosh, I got it.

3170
03:29:02,640 --> 03:29:02,880
Okay.

3171
03:29:05,540 --> 03:29:06,420
It's fine.

3172
03:29:06,560 --> 03:29:06,980
We're helping.

3173
03:29:12,140 --> 03:29:12,600
We're helping.

3174
03:29:14,540 --> 03:29:16,720
Okay, okay, we got this.

3175
03:29:21,900 --> 03:29:22,320
What?

3176
03:29:23,320 --> 03:29:23,320
What?

3177
03:29:25,100 --> 03:29:25,580
Oh!

3178
03:29:26,580 --> 03:29:27,200
Oh!

3179
03:29:28,220 --> 03:29:29,980
Oh my!

3180
03:29:30,480 --> 03:29:31,000
Oh!

3181
03:29:31,440 --> 03:29:33,260
Oh my god!

3182
03:29:34,260 --> 03:29:34,600
Oh!

3183
03:29:36,080 --> 03:29:38,040
Oh my god!

3184
03:29:44,040 --> 03:29:45,520
Oh no.

3185
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:47,260
Oh no.

3186
03:29:47,780 --> 03:29:49,840
You can jump through that coop of fire.

3187
03:29:50,220 --> 03:29:51,360
You'll learn some rings.

3188
03:29:51,700 --> 03:29:52,600
Thank you, Tails.

3189
03:29:53,360 --> 03:29:54,040
Shadow!

3190
03:29:54,400 --> 03:30:01,960
Do you think can grind along this road thank you okay we got
back about half of them i think you can get the rest

3191
03:30:06,620 --> 03:30:09,420

3192
03:30:12,580 --> 03:30:23,160

3193
03:30:23,160 --> 03:30:25,760
can get the rest of them?

3194
03:30:29,900 --> 03:30:33,080
Oh my god, this is so cruel, Tails.

3195
03:30:33,640 --> 03:30:34,760
This is so cruel.

3196
03:30:35,260 --> 03:30:37,660
Why would you do this to me?

3197
03:30:39,320 --> 03:30:42,860
Tails, this is why no one wants to be good.

3198
03:30:43,240 --> 03:30:43,840
Oh,

3199
03:30:49,140 --> 03:30:49,900
I fucked up.

3200
03:30:52,300 --> 03:30:53,580
It's okay.

3201
03:31:04,290 --> 03:31:05,570
There we go.

3202
03:31:06,090 --> 03:31:07,370
We saved it.

3203
03:31:08,190 --> 03:31:08,890
We saved it.

3204
03:31:09,190 --> 03:31:10,330
We saved it.

3205
03:31:10,350 --> 03:31:11,950
We saved it.

3206
03:31:12,450 --> 03:31:13,210
We saved it.

3207
03:31:14,810 --> 03:31:16,410
Everything is fine.

3208
03:31:17,290 --> 03:31:18,530
Everything is fine.

3209
03:31:21,230 --> 03:31:26,650
If you hit the middle of that device dead center with enough
force, you'll get maximum height.

3210
03:31:27,070 --> 03:31:30,310
If you can ring the gong at the top, you'll get a bunch of
rings.

3211
03:31:33,220 --> 03:31:33,820
Yay!

3212
03:31:39,880 --> 03:31:40,780
Oh my god.

3213
03:31:41,640 --> 03:31:43,160
Are you kidding me?

3214
03:31:44,060 --> 03:31:45,520
Are you?

3215
03:31:51,610 --> 03:31:52,510
I leave.

3216
03:31:54,490 --> 03:31:54,890
I leave.

3217
03:32:00,900 --> 03:32:01,660
We suck.

3218
03:32:02,200 --> 03:32:03,280
We suck here.

3219
03:32:05,840 --> 03:32:06,720
And then we leave.

3220
03:32:07,240 --> 03:32:07,500
We leave.

3221
03:32:07,600 --> 03:32:08,640
It's not worth it.

3222
03:32:09,840 --> 03:32:10,680
It's not worth it.

3223
03:32:10,900 --> 03:32:12,300
Make sure to hold on to your weight.

3224
03:32:33,420 --> 03:32:34,660
You say?

3225
03:32:43,260 --> 03:32:44,640
Okay, it's fine.

3226
03:32:45,100 --> 03:32:45,640
It's fine.

3227
03:32:48,740 --> 03:32:49,360
It's fine.

3228
03:32:49,840 --> 03:32:50,460
It's fine.

3229
03:32:54,680 --> 03:32:55,560
It's fine.

3230
03:32:56,000 --> 03:32:56,400
It's fine.

3231
03:32:57,420 --> 03:32:58,320
It's fine.

3232
03:32:58,940 --> 03:32:59,680
It's fine.

3233
03:32:59,700 --> 03:33:00,460
It's fine.

3234
03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:02,100
It's fine.

3235
03:33:02,280 --> 03:33:02,300
It's fine.

3236
03:33:02,300 --> 03:33:02,360
It's fine.

3237
03:33:02,360 --> 03:33:02,580
It's fine.

3238
03:33:02,620 --> 03:33:02,680
It's fine.

3239
03:33:02,700 --> 03:33:03,400
It's fine.

3240
03:33:04,120 --> 03:33:04,640
It's...

3241
03:33:05,760 --> 03:33:07,980
Oh, it is so funny.

3242
03:33:11,320 --> 03:33:16,060
For this shooting game, yellow balloons are worth twice as
much as the red one.

3243
03:33:16,600 --> 03:33:21,260
But shooting the ones with eggnog on them will take away
points, so don't hit those final shots.

3244
03:33:21,680 --> 03:33:23,140
Okay, that's fine.

3245
03:33:23,300 --> 03:33:25,020
There's another shooting gallery board.

3246
03:33:27,400 --> 03:33:28,200
It's okay.

3247
03:33:29,160 --> 03:33:29,740
It's okay.

3248
03:33:30,060 --> 03:33:30,360
It's okay.

3249
03:33:30,620 --> 03:33:31,100
It's okay.

3250
03:33:31,380 --> 03:33:31,760
It's okay.

3251
03:33:32,700 --> 03:33:33,800
Guys, it's okay.

3252
03:33:33,900 --> 03:33:34,300
It's okay.

3253
03:33:34,360 --> 03:33:34,800
It's okay.

3254
03:33:34,900 --> 03:33:35,400
It's okay.

3255
03:33:46,280 --> 03:33:48,340
Where are the balloons?

3256
03:33:55,700 --> 03:34:00,580
I didn't know the balloons was through the...

3257
03:34:00,580 --> 03:34:02,640
I didn't know.

3258
03:34:03,380 --> 03:34:04,200
I...

3259
03:34:04,200 --> 03:34:06,860
I didn't know.

3260
03:34:07,720 --> 03:34:08,100
Oh.

3261
03:34:09,980 --> 03:34:11,100
Oh.

3262
03:34:11,100 --> 03:34:11,720
Oh.

3263
03:34:12,160 --> 03:34:12,860
Oh.

3264
03:34:42,960 --> 03:34:44,360
My god.

3265
03:34:44,360 --> 03:34:46,540
that turret is so cool

3266
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:55,220

3268
03:35:20,680 --> 03:35:33,300
terrible death to all who oppose me when you stick to the
wall angle jump you can run forward a little we've only got

3269
03:35:33,300 --> 03:35:49,480
about two seconds before you fall though so be extra careful

3273
03:36:41,590 --> 03:36:45,010
Oh Oh, okay.

3274
03:36:47,830 --> 03:36:48,950
Oh, my God.

3275
03:36:50,030 --> 03:36:51,930
Oh, my God.

3276
03:36:54,250 --> 03:36:56,090
Oh, I hate that you're...

3277
03:36:56,090 --> 03:36:59,560
Oh, thank you.

3278
03:37:01,560 --> 03:37:02,720
Sorry, Doctor.

3279
03:37:03,060 --> 03:37:04,620
I got no time for games.

3280
03:37:05,080 --> 03:37:06,140
Oh, my God.

3281
03:37:07,320 --> 03:37:08,860
Oh, my God.

3282
03:37:12,120 --> 03:37:14,460
Thank God I'm so scared.

3283
03:37:14,520 --> 03:37:20,440
I got, I thought I was going to get five and then I would
leave one more ring and it was over.

3284
03:37:23,660 --> 03:37:25,220
Oh, thank God.

3285
03:37:25,580 --> 03:37:27,340
That was the hardest one.

3286
03:37:27,960 --> 03:37:30,200
That was the hardest level for me.

3287
03:37:32,040 --> 03:37:33,260
If we're easy.

3288
03:37:33,880 --> 03:37:38,720
Our sector B3 are reporting to the black aliens have
successfully been driven out of Westophilus.

3289
03:37:39,280 --> 03:37:40,280
Why black?

3290
03:37:42,100 --> 03:37:44,260
Who wrote this game?

3291
03:37:44,520 --> 03:37:45,260
Well done, Kevin.

3292
03:37:45,640 --> 03:37:47,080
Oh, crap, this game!

3293
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:50,900
Sir, we think Shadow escaped into the forest with the black
aliens.

3294
03:37:51,440 --> 03:37:58,280
Why are they so insid- like- I'm authorizing full use of all
tactical weapons.

3295
03:37:58,780 --> 03:38:02,960
I want both black aliens and Shadow stopped and buried.

3296
03:38:03,360 --> 03:38:05,340
Failure is not an option.

3297
03:38:05,800 --> 03:38:06,100
Yes, sir.

3298
03:38:09,680 --> 03:38:11,080
It's over, Shadow.

3299
03:38:11,620 --> 03:38:13,500
You'll finally be exposed to humanity.

3300
03:38:15,940 --> 03:38:30,460

3342
03:42:40,650 --> 03:42:43,290
Hang on to the bar and take out the aliens as you find them.

3343
03:42:45,350 --> 03:42:45,890
There you are.

3344
03:42:48,970 --> 03:42:49,970
Are these aliens?

3345
03:42:50,230 --> 03:42:52,830
Okay, we gotta get rid of them just for the fun of it.

3346
03:42:54,110 --> 03:42:54,790
Is it the checkpoint?

3347
03:42:55,070 --> 03:42:55,470

3348
03:42:56,410 --> 03:42:56,850

3358
03:43:40,770 --> 03:43:42,710
Guys, where's the checkpoint?

3359
03:43:43,310 --> 03:43:46,910
I still have yet to find guys, but why have I not found a
single checkpoint?

3360
03:43:49,450 --> 03:43:50,570
That's actually...

3361
03:43:50,570 --> 03:43:53,150
That's actually so crazy that I managed to miss.

3362
03:43:53,570 --> 03:43:55,710

3363
03:43:56,090 --> 03:43:57,210

03:44:07,330 --> 03:44:09,170
Oh my god, I missed a checkpoint here too.

3371
03:44:10,050 --> 03:44:12,050
Alright, surely, surely we got it.

3372
03:44:13,930 --> 03:44:15,130
That's an alien, right?

3373
03:44:15,370 --> 03:44:15,650
Nice.

3374
03:44:16,430 --> 03:44:18,070
Oh, the checkpoint was right behind us!

3375
03:44:18,130 --> 03:44:19,750
Let's go!

3376
03:44:21,810 --> 03:44:22,210
Okay.

3377
03:44:24,310 --> 03:44:25,510
We need five.

3378
03:44:26,370 --> 03:44:27,150
Just five.

3379
03:44:31,050 --> 03:44:31,970
Surely... Oh, nice.

3380
03:44:32,390 --> 03:44:33,170
You five!

3381
03:44:33,470 --> 03:44:34,010
One more!

3382
03:44:34,190 --> 03:44:34,610
Behold!

Take this!

3386
03:44:41,230 --> 03:44:42,710
Okay, you get out of here.

3387
03:44:42,850 --> 03:44:43,250
I need a fight.

3388
03:44:43,370 --> 03:44:43,790
There you go.

3389
03:44:44,510 --> 03:44:45,670
Oh, we did it.

3390
03:44:47,830 --> 03:44:48,770
We did it.

3391
03:44:49,610 --> 03:44:50,070
We did it.

3392
03:44:50,070 --> 03:44:50,530
We did it.

3393
03:44:52,010 --> 03:44:53,550
We won't let you get away.

3394
03:44:53,790 --> 03:44:55,350
I won't let you get away with trying to invade this planet.

3395
03:44:57,810 --> 03:45:00,570
For your Sandy, do the evil mission for this level.

3396
03:45:00,650 --> 03:45:02,270
Unless you want to play one of the worst...

3397
03:45:02,390 --> 03:45:04,570
Oh, wait, what do you mean?

3398
03:45:04,930 --> 03:45:05,770
Wait, no.

3399
03:45:07,150 --> 03:45:09,070

03:45:09,610 --> 03:45:10,470
Oh, no.

3401
03:45:12,010 --> 03:45:12,670
Oh, no.

3402
03:45:13,290 --> 03:45:16,310
Why didn't I read it before I completed it?

3403
03:45:18,710 --> 03:45:20,950
I can't think of this super chat thing.

3404
03:45:21,470 --> 03:45:21,730
Thank you.

3408
03:45:27,730 --> 03:45:28,470
What'd you say?

3409
03:45:28,910 --> 03:45:31,310

03:46:11,170 --> 03:46:12,810

I swear to God, I'm so confused.

3424
03:46:34,590 --> 03:46:35,890
I'm so confused.

3425
03:46:36,070 --> 03:46:37,470
I don't know why I won't hit it.

3426
03:46:37,810 --> 03:46:38,190
There you go.

3427
03:46:39,170 --> 03:46:40,230
How did I kill him?

3428
03:46:41,390 --> 03:46:43,710

I don't understand.

03:47:22,320 --> 03:47:23,080
I don't.

3436
03:47:23,420 --> 03:47:24,440
I don't understand.

3437
03:47:26,620 --> 03:47:27,640
Oh my god.

3438
03:47:27,920 --> 03:47:28,300
I...

3439
03:47:32,820 --> 03:47:34,480
I'm so confused.

3440
03:47:34,760 --> 03:47:36,460
I'm so confused, guys.

3441
03:47:40,410 --> 03:47:42,730

03:47:49,550 --> 03:47:52,750
I swear to God, I'm trying so hard.

3445
03:47:53,410 --> 03:47:55,050
When I jump, it doesn't do it.

3446
03:47:55,190 --> 03:47:56,910
It doesn't even hit it naturally.

3447
03:48:07,080 --> 03:48:08,300
Oh, my God, I hate this.

3448
03:48:09,040 --> 03:48:10,100
I hate this.

3449
03:48:10,880 --> 03:48:11,180
I...

3450
03:48:20,720 --> 03:48:22,360
Give me your gun.

3451
03:48:27,100 --> 03:48:27,880
Jump and don't move.

3452
03:48:29,380 --> 03:48:29,820
Okay.

3453
03:48:31,120 --> 03:48:31,560
Okay.

3454
03:48:39,050 --> 03:48:39,730
Oh my god.

3455
03:48:40,390 --> 03:48:40,790
Oh my god.

3456
03:48:40,790 --> 03:48:41,370
Oh my, give me your gun.

3457
03:48:41,930 --> 03:48:42,590
Give me your gun.

3458
03:48:42,910 --> 03:48:45,190
This, this is the worst boss fight I've ever seen.

3459
03:48:46,690 --> 03:48:47,950
This is the worst one.

3460
03:48:48,830 --> 03:48:50,430
This is, I, I found it.

3461
03:48:50,730 --> 03:48:52,090
I would, I, I found it.

3462
03:48:52,510 --> 03:48:54,030
I'm like doing nothing too.

3463
03:48:57,070 --> 03:48:59,310
Oh my god, I, oh.

3464
03:49:12,250 --> 03:49:13,370
Where are you in?

3465
03:49:13,510 --> 03:49:14,770
Okay, oh my god, I found it.

3466
03:49:15,090 --> 03:49:16,070
Oh my god, I found it.

3467
03:49:18,970 --> 03:49:21,270
I found it.

3468
03:49:21,450 --> 03:49:22,810
I found it.

3469
03:49:23,290 --> 03:49:24,610
I'm so sad.

3470
03:49:25,690 --> 03:49:26,650
I'm so sad.

3471
03:49:29,710 --> 03:49:30,030
There we go.

3472
03:49:30,490 --> 03:49:31,690
Oh my god, there we go.

3473
03:49:31,930 --> 03:49:32,430
Never mind.

3474
03:49:32,530 --> 03:49:33,470
This is not the worst part.

3475
03:49:33,610 --> 03:49:34,670
This is not the worst boss.

3476
03:49:35,130 --> 03:49:36,170
It is not the worst boss.

3477
03:49:37,730 --> 03:49:40,050
I didn't realize you just jump and shoot.

3478
03:49:40,410 --> 03:49:41,110
There's no way.

3479
03:49:41,130 --> 03:49:42,630
There we go.

3480
03:49:43,270 --> 03:49:45,050
A moment someone's like, just jump and shoot.

3481
03:49:45,490 --> 03:49:46,590
Everything clicked together.

3482
03:49:47,390 --> 03:49:48,190
Everything clicked.

3483
03:49:53,540 --> 03:49:54,280
Oh, all right.

3484
03:49:54,400 --> 03:49:59,020
Time for the quote-unquote worst mission of all time,
apparently.

3485
03:50:01,280 --> 03:50:03,160
Now the worst part is here.

3486
03:50:08,740 --> 03:50:10,620
Why is it so hard to be good?

3487
03:50:11,780 --> 03:50:14,560
Why does being good cause so much pain?

3488
03:50:16,260 --> 03:50:16,900
Hey, Sonic.

3489
03:50:16,960 --> 03:50:17,280

03:53:36,010 --> 03:53:36,950
That's good to know now.

3517
03:53:37,150 --> 03:53:37,430
That's good.

3518
03:53:37,910 --> 03:53:38,590
That's good to know.

3519
03:53:39,370 --> 03:53:40,290
That's a pit.

3520
03:53:43,230 --> 03:53:44,070
Underneath that.

3521
03:53:44,250 --> 03:53:44,830
It's good.

3522
03:53:44,890 --> 03:53:45,810
It's good information.

3523
03:53:46,930 --> 03:53:49,030
I'm glad that you told me right on time.

3524
03:53:49,550 --> 03:53:50,870
I'm so happy.

3525
03:53:51,210 --> 03:53:51,890
There it is.

3526
03:53:52,250 --> 03:53:54,710
The artificial chaos is out of its own.

3527
03:53:57,760 --> 03:53:59,120
Am I shooting it?

3528
03:53:59,180 --> 03:53:59,800
Yeah, I am.

3529
03:54:01,380 --> 03:54:01,940
They're multiple.

3530
03:54:02,120 --> 03:54:04,060
Do you think we should see this place?

3531
03:54:04,260 --> 03:54:06,440
No, I want their guns.

3532
03:54:07,960 --> 03:54:09,620
No, I need their guns.

3533
03:54:09,860 --> 03:54:10,860
I need a reload.

3534
03:54:12,360 --> 03:54:13,700
What's gun is this?

3535
03:54:14,900 --> 03:54:16,020
Oh, yeah, no, I'll take this.

3536
03:54:19,440 --> 03:54:20,380
I'll keep the pistol.

3537
03:54:28,740 --> 03:54:29,600
Are you serious?

3538
03:54:29,960 --> 03:54:30,880
Who are you shooting?

3539
03:54:31,280 --> 03:54:31,860
Who are you?

3540
03:54:31,940 --> 03:54:32,120
There.

3541
03:54:32,240 --> 03:54:32,500
There.

3542
03:54:33,500 --> 03:54:34,580
You deserve that.

3543
03:54:37,560 --> 03:54:38,320
Oh, my God.

3544
03:54:38,420 --> 03:54:39,060
Do I have?

3545
03:54:39,160 --> 03:54:39,860
Okay, there's a checkpoint.

3546
03:54:40,120 --> 03:54:40,740
Oh, my God.

3547
03:54:40,800 --> 03:54:42,180
There was a checkpoint right there.

3548
03:54:42,320 --> 03:54:43,080
I'm so sad.

3549
03:54:44,900 --> 03:54:47,980
No, we don't need this.

3550
03:54:48,140 --> 03:54:49,030
We just need more gun

3551
03:54:56,340 --> 03:55:02,180
I'm being very careful right now Maria Very very careful

3552
03:55:08,460 --> 03:55:10,000
Oh, what do you mean?

3553
03:55:10,240 --> 03:55:15,560
Thank merciful modern You mean it could have been much much
more worse How?

3554
03:55:15,980 --> 03:55:17,560
Oh my oh my

3555
03:55:25,320 --> 03:55:30,240
Thank God Thank God they give me mercy

3556
03:55:39,660 --> 03:55:45,880
There you go Thank God there is mercy in this world

3557
03:55:55,230 --> 03:56:01,050
Alright Are there Where am I?

3558
03:56:01,610 --> 03:56:01,830
Where the?

3559
03:56:02,790 --> 03:56:03,570
Where am I?

3560
03:56:03,790 --> 03:56:08,350
You call yourself gun soldiers Like where are they?

3561
03:56:08,350 --> 03:56:12,140
Oh there it is All right, there they are.

3562
03:56:13,090 --> 03:56:14,770
Oh my god, I have to find all three.

3563
03:56:15,110 --> 03:56:17,230
Oh my god, get out, get out, get out.

3564
03:56:18,250 --> 03:56:18,570
There you go.

3565
03:56:18,770 --> 03:56:19,310
Give me your gun.

3566
03:56:19,950 --> 03:56:24,330
There you go.

3567
03:56:25,730 --> 03:56:26,830
Instead of 35.

3568
03:56:27,550 --> 03:56:31,590
I like how the five is like, makes such a big difference.

3569
03:56:31,750 --> 03:56:34,350
You guys are like, thank God it's not 35.

3570
03:56:35,170 --> 03:56:36,710
And that worries me.

3571
03:56:37,350 --> 03:56:38,950
That makes me scared.

3572
03:56:39,430 --> 03:56:41,090
The experiments are fusing together.

3573
03:56:41,730 --> 03:56:42,270
What?

3574
03:56:44,910 --> 03:56:46,110
Is there anything up here?

3575
03:56:48,090 --> 03:56:49,090
That scares me.

3576
03:56:49,250 --> 03:56:50,870
That five makes a huge difference.

3577
03:56:53,070 --> 03:56:55,230
That actually scares me a lot.

3578
03:56:59,780 --> 03:57:00,920
So you guys don't worry, it's five.

3579
03:57:06,800 --> 03:57:08,220
Oh my god, where?

3580
03:57:09,780 --> 03:57:11,440
Oh, I'm supposed to go up.

3581
03:57:17,770 --> 03:57:18,290
All right.

3582
03:57:24,810 --> 03:57:25,490
Here we go.

3583
03:57:26,030 --> 03:57:27,090
Wait, it's not here?

3584
03:57:27,730 --> 03:57:30,450
Where the fuck am I supposed to- Oh my god, I'm already
lost.

3585
03:57:30,850 --> 03:57:33,130
I'm already lost in this fucked up world.

3586
03:57:36,470 --> 03:57:37,930
Oh my god, I don't know.

3587
03:57:39,710 --> 03:57:41,790
I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

3588
03:57:48,380 --> 03:57:49,640
I don't know what they're talking about, guys.

3589
03:57:49,720 --> 03:57:51,300
This was like level with a cakewalk.

3590
03:57:51,640 --> 03:57:52,640
Then where do I go?

3591
03:57:54,300 --> 03:57:55,860
Where the fuck do I go?

3592
03:57:59,020 --> 03:58:01,600
Like, is there, like, Is there a secret hole here?

3593
03:58:02,180 --> 03:58:03,000
Where is it?

3594
03:58:09,150 --> 03:58:10,790
Like, where am I?

3595
03:58:10,930 --> 03:58:11,470
Okay, okay.

3596
03:58:11,830 --> 03:58:13,090
Calm down, Doki.

3597
03:58:14,230 --> 03:58:15,490
There's a pull here.

3598
03:58:15,750 --> 03:58:17,410
We're suffering severe casualties.

3599
03:58:17,710 --> 03:58:18,850
Maybe I climb up the pull?

3600
03:58:19,530 --> 03:58:20,570
That's right, Shadow.

3601
03:58:20,830 --> 03:58:21,370
Work it.

3602
03:58:21,490 --> 03:58:23,210
Work that pull, Shadow.

3603
03:58:23,970 --> 03:58:25,090
You go, girl.

3604
03:58:25,990 --> 03:58:26,970
It was not the pull.

3605
03:58:28,470 --> 03:58:29,610
It was not the pull.

3606
03:58:29,730 --> 03:58:31,570
We got to slide down like a fireman now.

3607
03:58:32,270 --> 03:58:32,790
Whoa.

3608
03:58:34,050 --> 03:58:35,110
That's right.

3609
03:58:35,470 --> 03:58:36,690
Whoa, Shadow.

3610
03:58:37,390 --> 03:58:37,710
Whoa.

3611
03:58:38,590 --> 03:58:39,650
Work that pull.

3612
03:58:41,370 --> 03:58:45,350
Can we hit the mutated experiments with a gunlift?

3613
03:58:46,270 --> 03:58:47,550
Damn, Shadow.

3614
03:58:49,010 --> 03:58:50,790
You know how to work that pull, bro?

3615
03:58:52,090 --> 03:58:54,690
Gotta pay that college tuition somehow.

3616
03:58:57,350 --> 03:58:59,890
I'm just gonna slowly walk down.

3617
03:59:01,010 --> 03:59:03,010
I don't trust myself at all.

3618
03:59:04,050 --> 03:59:06,010
Where else am I supposed to go?

3619
03:59:11,560 --> 03:59:12,200
What?

3620
03:59:21,160 --> 03:59:21,300
What?

3621
03:59:25,920 --> 03:59:26,560
Okay.

3622
03:59:29,340 --> 03:59:29,840
Okay.

3623
03:59:32,300 --> 03:59:32,640
Okay.

3624
03:59:36,120 --> 03:59:38,440
At least I figured it out.

3625
03:59:40,400 --> 03:59:40,880
All right.

3626
03:59:41,180 --> 03:59:41,520
Wait, wait.

3627
03:59:41,680 --> 03:59:42,260
Was that experiment?

3628
03:59:42,660 --> 03:59:43,840
No, that was just a regular guy.

3629
03:59:44,720 --> 03:59:45,040
Okay.

3630
03:59:49,490 --> 03:59:50,830
Okay, we got another one.

3631
03:59:54,070 --> 03:59:55,830
Let's get him out of here.

3632
04:00:00,470 --> 04:00:04,110
I mean, they're all sort of dead already, so we should be
good.

3633
04:00:05,410 --> 04:00:06,350
Is there any extra here?

3634
04:00:07,370 --> 04:00:08,050
Oh, no.

3635
04:00:08,790 --> 04:00:10,850
Not just for the sake of it.

3636
04:00:11,370 --> 04:00:11,930
Snackies!

3637
04:00:13,570 --> 04:00:15,830
Maybe I accidentally shot somebody.

3638
04:00:18,830 --> 04:00:21,130
Buy products based on a god

3639
04:00:27,320 --> 04:00:29,220
Is there anything missing here?

3640
04:00:29,780 --> 04:00:30,340
I'm scared.

3641
04:00:30,540 --> 04:00:34,700
I'm so paranoid right now I know I'm like checking
everything.

3642
04:00:34,840 --> 04:00:38,080
I'm so fucking paranoid, but where did I come I came from
this way.

3643
04:00:38,600 --> 04:00:45,140
Okay Thank you Maria All right, we're good.

3644
04:00:45,280 --> 04:00:45,440
We're good.

3645
04:00:45,540 --> 04:00:45,880
We're good.

3646
04:00:46,240 --> 04:00:46,240
We're good.

3647
04:00:46,500 --> 04:00:46,740
Go in

3648
04:00:54,440 --> 04:01:00,080
Okay We got an experiment Jesus Christ.

3649
04:01:00,320 --> 04:01:03,360
It is like actually like hide-and-seek right now.

3650
04:01:05,100 --> 04:01:06,820
Oh, are they hiding anywhere?

3651
04:01:07,380 --> 04:01:08,480
Oh, where are you?

3652
04:01:09,020 --> 04:01:10,200
There's no... Okay, there it is.

3653
04:01:10,280 --> 04:01:12,840
I was gonna say there's no way there's just one of them
here.

3654
04:01:13,660 --> 04:01:15,820
I'm literally playing hide-and-seek with these guys.

3655
04:01:19,000 --> 04:01:19,960
Alright, nice.

3656
04:01:20,620 --> 04:01:22,020
We're not even halfway.

3657
04:01:22,540 --> 04:01:23,680
That's... That's okay.

3658
04:01:24,160 --> 04:01:24,700
That's okay.

3659
04:01:25,280 --> 04:01:29,040
It's fine that we're not Okay.

3660
04:01:31,660 --> 04:01:32,020
Alright.

3661
04:01:35,240 --> 04:01:36,440
Okay, we got another checkpoint.

3662
04:01:36,660 --> 04:01:37,060
Thank God.

3663
04:01:39,500 --> 04:01:40,220
Elevators here.

3664
04:01:41,800 --> 04:01:42,080
Phew.

3665
04:01:46,660 --> 04:01:47,060
Oh, God.

3666
04:01:47,360 --> 04:01:47,620
Oh, God.

3667
04:01:47,720 --> 04:01:48,380
Okay, I almost got crushed.

3668
04:01:48,480 --> 04:01:48,780
That's fine.

3669
04:01:48,860 --> 04:01:49,140
That's fine.

3670
04:01:49,220 --> 04:01:49,760
We didn't get crushed.

3671
04:01:49,840 --> 04:01:50,860
We didn't get crushed, guys.

3672
04:01:53,520 --> 04:01:53,880
Alright.

3673
04:01:54,500 --> 04:01:55,540
Up we go.

3674
04:01:57,960 --> 04:01:58,320
Uh.

3675
04:02:01,000 --> 04:02:02,060
Where could he be?

3676
04:02:02,080 --> 04:02:08,200
If I was a fucked-up experiment, where would I be?

3677
04:02:09,460 --> 04:02:09,980
Oh, okay.

3678
04:02:11,440 --> 04:02:13,480
It's time to work that pull again, Shadow.

3679
04:02:13,720 --> 04:02:14,620
Let's go!

3680
04:02:15,040 --> 04:02:15,280
Woo!

3681
04:02:16,100 --> 04:02:17,400
Oh, shit, you're over here.

3682
04:02:17,720 --> 04:02:18,100
Give me a sec.

3683
04:02:21,040 --> 04:02:22,160
There you go, we got it.

3684
04:02:25,080 --> 04:02:25,920
That's right.

3685
04:02:26,080 --> 04:02:26,980
Work it.

3686
04:02:27,140 --> 04:02:28,980
Wow, chicko-wow-wow.

3687
04:02:30,100 --> 04:02:31,160
Is there anything else up here?

3688
04:02:32,400 --> 04:02:33,440
They were good.

3689
04:02:35,500 --> 04:02:35,920
Right?

3690
04:02:37,280 --> 04:02:38,340
Oh, there's more.

3691
04:02:38,960 --> 04:02:39,560
Hello, guys.

3692
04:02:40,600 --> 04:02:42,040
You guys call for...

3693
04:02:42,040 --> 04:02:43,160
Is it somebody's birthday?

3694
04:02:43,980 --> 04:02:46,080
I heard it's somebody's birthday.

3695
04:02:46,720 --> 04:02:47,360
Oh, not you.

3696
04:02:49,620 --> 04:02:51,400
Am I shooting it?

3697
04:02:52,020 --> 04:02:52,640
I think so.

3698
04:02:54,040 --> 04:02:54,920
Oh, my God.

3699
04:02:55,000 --> 04:02:56,000
You guys are so annoying.

3700
04:02:57,820 --> 04:02:58,780
Oh, shit!

3701
04:03:00,920 --> 04:03:01,680
It's fine.

3702
04:03:01,840 --> 04:03:02,060
I'm going to shoot.

3703
04:03:02,080 --> 04:03:02,580
You guys do.

3704
04:03:03,280 --> 04:03:04,200
You guys mess with me.

3705
04:03:05,060 --> 04:03:06,580
You guys mess with the Groove!

3706
04:03:09,800 --> 04:03:10,380
That's right.

3707
04:03:10,460 --> 04:03:12,840
I am willing to waste my ammo.

3708
04:03:16,300 --> 04:03:17,220
Oh, hey guys.

3709
04:03:20,400 --> 04:03:21,140
What the fuck?

3710
04:03:21,240 --> 04:03:22,100
There's nothing here.

3711
04:03:25,200 --> 04:03:26,200
But there's nothing here.

3712
04:03:26,940 --> 04:03:27,880
Why is there a room?

3713
04:03:28,000 --> 04:03:29,480
It was Keith's birthday.

3714
04:03:29,920 --> 04:03:32,060
Happy birthday to you.

Oh, here.

Which way do we go?

3720
04:04:10,510 --> 04:04:11,690
Oh, my God, Maria, please.

3721
04:04:12,050 --> 04:04:13,250
Don't you live here?

3722
04:04:14,290 --> 04:04:15,870
Should you know where to go, Maria?

3723
04:04:16,450 --> 04:04:17,950
You literally live here.

3724
04:04:19,490 --> 04:04:22,070
Your dad is the CEO of this fucking lab.

3725
04:04:27,520 --> 04:04:28,800
I'm just gonna shoot it.

3726
04:04:29,140 --> 04:04:29,340
Oh.

3727
04:04:35,380 --> 04:04:36,980
You think I can bounce off of it?

04:05:48,940 --> 04:05:50,520

04:05:51,120 --> 04:05:51,720

3735
04:05:57,720 --> 04:05:58,540
All right.

3736
04:05:58,980 --> 04:05:59,740
One down.

3737
04:06:02,260 --> 04:06:03,770
Just gotta slowly climb up.

3738
04:06:05,380 --> 04:06:06,260
It's okay.

3739
04:06:07,920 --> 04:06:10,600
I heard it's someone's birthday again.

3740
04:06:12,620 --> 04:06:13,920
I heard it.

3741
04:06:14,060 --> 04:06:15,880
Who's the lucky guy?

3742
04:06:19,300 --> 04:06:20,260
Oh, no.

3743
04:06:20,440 --> 04:06:21,460
Okay, I got...

3744
04:06:21,460 --> 04:06:22,760
I need you to give me your gun.

3745
04:06:25,080 --> 04:06:25,820
Bro.

3746
04:06:25,840 --> 04:06:27,080
I need you to give me your gun.

3747
04:06:27,420 --> 04:06:27,760
There you go.

3748
04:06:29,300 --> 04:06:30,380
Okay, that's awkward.

3749
04:06:33,140 --> 04:06:34,440
Give me a sec.

3750
04:06:35,580 --> 04:06:36,580
You don't understand.

3751
04:06:37,240 --> 04:06:40,580
It's actually very hard to aim with this.

3752
04:06:43,540 --> 04:06:44,560
Guys, you don't understand.

3753
04:06:44,900 --> 04:06:47,860
It's very hard to aim with it.

3754
04:06:47,920 --> 04:06:49,520
No, you don't understand, guys.

3755
04:06:49,600 --> 04:06:51,680
It was so hard to aim with it.

3756
04:06:56,940 --> 04:06:58,640
I swear to God.

3757
04:07:02,140 --> 04:07:02,820
Okay, there you go.

3758
04:07:02,960 --> 04:07:03,140
It's fine.

3759
04:07:03,300 --> 04:07:03,520
It's fine.

3760
04:07:03,720 --> 04:07:03,920
It's fine.

3761
04:07:04,060 --> 04:07:04,400
It's fine.

3762
04:07:05,280 --> 04:07:06,480
I got another...

3763
04:07:08,020 --> 04:07:08,560
It's fine.

3764
04:07:08,640 --> 04:07:09,480
I'm gonna kill him.

3765
04:07:11,860 --> 04:07:13,560
All right, we can try this again.

3766
04:07:16,420 --> 04:07:16,700
There, see?

3767
04:07:16,780 --> 04:07:17,380
I did it.

3768
04:07:18,840 --> 04:07:20,360
And that's still your gun, too.

3769
04:07:20,980 --> 04:07:21,820
See, told you guys.

3770
04:07:21,920 --> 04:07:22,780
See, I did it.

3771
04:07:22,800 --> 04:07:23,140
I did it.

3772
04:07:23,160 --> 04:07:23,880
It wasn't that high.

3773
04:07:32,900 --> 04:07:33,500
this again.

3774
04:07:34,960 --> 04:07:35,020
It's not.

3775
04:07:35,140 --> 04:07:35,620
It's okay.

3776
04:07:35,760 --> 04:07:36,600
We got this.

3777
04:07:37,120 --> 04:07:41,220
So now that I have this, I can just kill him.

3778
04:07:42,040 --> 04:07:47,680
You can use that experiment to bounce off it using your
homing attacks, but it's very dangerous.

3779
04:07:51,540 --> 04:07:51,960
There we go.

3780
04:07:52,020 --> 04:07:53,020
We don't have to go back there.

3781
04:07:53,440 --> 04:07:54,160
That was a trap.

3782
04:07:54,580 --> 04:07:56,100
That area was a fucking trap.

3783
04:07:57,440 --> 04:07:59,220
We can't go back there.

3784
04:08:03,540 --> 04:08:04,260
I hit it?

3785
04:08:05,820 --> 04:08:08,240
That Oh god.

3786
04:08:09,080 --> 04:08:09,940
Did I hit it?

3787
04:08:10,960 --> 04:08:11,460
Okay, I hit.

3788
04:08:11,800 --> 04:08:12,340
Okay, I got it.

3789
04:08:12,400 --> 04:08:12,760
I got it.

3790
04:08:12,760 --> 04:08:13,360
I got it.

3791
04:08:14,360 --> 04:08:15,120
There, see, I did.

3792
04:08:15,260 --> 04:08:15,900
Oh, shit!

3793
04:08:16,980 --> 04:08:17,840
I need another gun.

3794
04:08:18,340 --> 04:08:19,000
Give me your gun.

3795
04:08:22,060 --> 04:08:22,940
This is easier.

3796
04:08:23,940 --> 04:08:25,020
Oh my god, are you serious?

3797
04:08:25,720 --> 04:08:26,460
Give me your gun.

3798
04:08:31,460 --> 04:08:32,140
There we go.

3799
04:08:32,860 --> 04:08:33,720
I figured it out.

3800
04:08:35,600 --> 04:08:36,560
Oh my god, where am I?

3801
04:08:41,350 --> 04:08:41,890
is this?

3802
04:08:43,710 --> 04:08:44,630
I get that.

3803
04:08:46,510 --> 04:08:48,250
What the fuck is that sound?

3804
04:08:50,310 --> 04:08:52,670
You could have just passed, Loki.

3805
04:08:54,390 --> 04:08:56,390
Look, I'm too scared of confrontation.

3806
04:09:02,220 --> 04:09:04,280
If I kill them, I never have to ask.

3807
04:09:08,460 --> 04:09:09,000
Whoops.

3808
04:09:13,240 --> 04:09:16,380
Well, they're die regardless, unfortunately.

3809
04:09:17,820 --> 04:09:22,720
I mean, it's like, those people are gonna die, Sonic, if you
don't save them.

3810
04:09:22,820 --> 04:09:30,760
I'm like, um, yeah, um, unfortunately they may or may not be
dead but it's not because of me.

3811
04:09:33,820 --> 04:09:40,000
This part, but, I went the other way because I thought
they're, I thought it was a dead end.

3812
04:09:41,100 --> 04:09:44,520
The gun soldiers have been taken down by the research and
spear

3813
04:09:49,030 --> 04:09:49,710
Oh, hey.

3814
04:09:50,090 --> 04:09:51,010
Oh, they're all down.

3815
04:09:51,430 --> 04:09:52,550
Don't worry, I got you, guys.

3816
04:09:58,370 --> 04:09:59,030
Oh, whoops.

3817
04:10:00,350 --> 04:10:00,930
It's okay.

3818
04:10:00,990 --> 04:10:01,630
I know what to do.

3819
04:10:02,070 --> 04:10:03,370
Watch this, guys.

3820
04:10:09,090 --> 04:10:09,330
Yay.

3821
04:10:10,570 --> 04:10:11,490
Oh, nice checkpoint.

3822
04:10:11,790 --> 04:10:13,050
Okay, I'm going to go back upstairs.

3823
04:10:15,990 --> 04:10:17,710
There must be another path for this, right?

3824
04:10:20,010 --> 04:10:21,170
Wait, where's the...

3825
04:10:24,980 --> 04:10:26,560
I don't know why I'm max evil.

3826
04:10:26,700 --> 04:10:27,180
I'm hoping.

3827
04:10:28,380 --> 04:10:30,580
What did I do wrong?

3828
04:10:33,860 --> 04:10:34,900
Oh, shit.

3829
04:10:35,140 --> 04:10:35,800
Where am I?

3830
04:10:36,160 --> 04:10:36,860
Oh, my God.

3831
04:10:37,040 --> 04:10:37,780
Okay, it's fine.

3832
04:10:38,900 --> 04:10:41,940
I don't know what's causing me to...

3833
04:10:42,540 --> 04:10:43,480
I don't know.

3834
04:10:43,940 --> 04:10:46,880
I'm just as equally as confused as you guys.

3835
04:10:50,980 --> 04:10:52,220
I'm so sad.

3836
04:10:53,600 --> 04:11:06,460
I'm so sad I'm where how where am I like actually where am I
oh my god I'm back here oh okay uh guys I don't remember how

3837
04:11:06,460 --> 04:11:16,500
to okay it's this way it's this way all right we go this way
and then we go this way and then we TP

3838
04:11:21,720 --> 04:11:27,400
no Okay, and then we hit him again and hit him again.

3839
04:11:27,560 --> 04:11:28,740
There you go.

3840
04:11:29,000 --> 04:11:30,360
Snow and steady, guys.

3841
04:11:30,980 --> 04:11:32,340
As in all Sonic games.

3842
04:11:35,080 --> 04:11:35,340
Okay.

3843
04:11:36,460 --> 04:11:36,840
Okay.

3844
04:11:38,180 --> 04:11:40,000
We go this way.

3845
04:11:40,380 --> 04:11:42,540
And then we go this way.

3846
04:11:43,560 --> 04:11:45,620
And then it's this way.

3847
04:11:48,580 --> 04:11:51,260
And it would be very helpful if I had a gun right now.

3848
04:11:53,420 --> 04:11:54,640
You know what?

3849
04:11:54,900 --> 04:11:56,460
I wish I didn't remember Maria.

3850
04:11:58,580 --> 04:11:59,380
No!

3851
04:12:04,330 --> 04:12:06,070
Don't say it, guys.

3852
04:12:07,030 --> 04:12:08,470
Don't say it.

3853
04:12:13,530 --> 04:12:15,450
Okay, that was on.

3854
04:12:16,530 --> 04:12:19,410
This is why Shadow forgot Maria.

3855
04:12:19,850 --> 04:12:21,290
I wish I suppressed my...

3856
04:12:21,290 --> 04:12:24,010
No wonder he suppressed his memory of Maria.

3857
04:12:26,710 --> 04:12:27,510
Okay.

3858
04:12:28,070 --> 04:12:29,210
If I drop from...

3859
04:12:29,230 --> 04:12:29,790
Here.

3860
04:12:30,490 --> 04:12:31,790
It should be fine.

3861
04:12:35,860 --> 04:12:36,780
There you go.

3862
04:12:37,460 --> 04:12:39,740
Oh my god, I saw a missed accident.

3863
04:12:41,400 --> 04:12:42,540
Don't fuck this.

3864
04:12:43,360 --> 04:12:44,120
Get out of here!

3865
04:12:44,500 --> 04:12:45,040
Boom!

3866
04:12:46,760 --> 04:12:47,770
Alright, I did it.

3867
04:12:49,360 --> 04:12:50,780
Third time's the try.

3868
04:12:51,340 --> 04:12:51,880
How do I...

3869
04:12:51,880 --> 04:12:53,840
Oh my god, and it gave me a gun.

3870
04:12:54,540 --> 04:12:57,700
And of course, it gave me a gun when I never needed it.

3871
04:13:00,800 --> 04:13:01,340
Alright.

3872
04:13:01,360 --> 04:13:04,200
Just for that one guy, it was worth it.

3873
04:13:04,300 --> 04:13:05,480
It was so worth it.

3874
04:13:06,000 --> 04:13:07,320
Oh my god, there's still eight more.

3875
04:13:07,680 --> 04:13:09,180
There's still eight more of this hellhole.

3876
04:13:09,580 --> 04:13:12,520
The thing is, I can't die or I have to do that again.

3877
04:13:14,460 --> 04:13:15,940
Oh, this is the worst part.

3878
04:13:16,340 --> 04:13:17,840
The worst part is I can't die.

3879
04:13:18,060 --> 04:13:20,240
Because I don't know where the next checkpoint is.

3880
04:13:22,800 --> 04:13:23,640
Where is he?

3881
04:13:24,100 --> 04:13:24,460
No.

3882
04:13:30,940 --> 04:13:33,140
Oh my god, please tell me it's shooting him.

3883
04:13:40,340 --> 04:13:42,300
Oh my god, it's all the way back there.

3884
04:13:46,540 --> 04:13:47,780
Oh my god, please.

3885
04:13:48,260 --> 04:13:49,420
Please, but I love God.

3886
04:13:50,700 --> 04:13:50,940
No!

3887
04:13:55,340 --> 04:13:56,180
Oh, I can go back.

3888
04:13:56,620 --> 04:13:57,480
Oh, I can go back.

3889
04:13:57,780 --> 04:13:58,440

04:15:06,280 --> 04:15:09,140
It's okay, it's still, it's still made it.

3900
04:15:09,520 --> 04:15:10,900
We're almost there.

3901
04:15:15,300 --> 04:15:16,300
Alright, nice, okay.

3902
04:15:17,760 --> 04:15:20,220
Four more, four more, four more, four more.

3903
04:15:22,480 --> 04:15:24,320
Well, there you go.

3904
04:15:25,980 --> 04:15:27,980
Okay, more and more to go.

3905
04:15:28,780 --> 04:15:29,980
More and more to go, guys.

3906
04:15:30,380 --> 04:15:31,780
I can smell freedom.

3907
04:15:37,320 --> 04:15:41,060
Oh my god, now I have to worry about meteors.

3908
04:15:41,900 --> 04:15:44,480
What the fuck is wrong with your dad?

3909
04:15:46,180 --> 04:15:47,580
Why are there...

3910
04:15:47,580 --> 04:15:51,500
Why are there no defense mechanisms for these fucking
meteors?

3911
04:15:51,960 --> 04:15:54,800
They're not supposed to be this close to the ship.

3912
04:16:01,540 --> 04:16:02,960
This is not safe.

3913
04:16:03,540 --> 04:16:05,680
This is not a safe place for children

3914
04:16:10,270 --> 04:16:17,270
I didn't even see a single fucking experiment here I'm
fucking leaving Fuck this, there was no experiment here I

3915
04:16:17,270 --> 04:16:26,650
was lied to I went out here for nothing Oh my god Okay,
okay, okay Alright, that's fine, that's okay

3916
04:16:29,830 --> 04:16:37,970
Alright, okay Nope, there was, never mind, JK JK Guys, guys,
guys, he ran into me.

3917
04:16:38,070 --> 04:16:38,970
It's like a deer, okay?

3918
04:16:39,430 --> 04:16:42,110
I did not commit a hit or run.

3919
04:16:42,530 --> 04:16:44,010
He ran into me.

3920
04:16:47,470 --> 04:16:49,250
We all saw it, guys.

3921
04:16:49,490 --> 04:16:53,070
We all saw the experiment running into my car like a deer.

3922
04:17:00,570 --> 04:17:02,470
Maria, they're trying to kill me.

3923
04:17:07,890 --> 04:17:08,850
What the fuck?

3924
04:17:09,810 --> 04:17:11,690
They're multiplying at an extreme rate.

3925
04:17:12,310 --> 04:17:14,230
I haven't even seen one of them yet.

3926
04:17:14,450 --> 04:17:15,390
Where are they multiplying?

3927
04:17:18,810 --> 04:17:20,010
Holy shit.

3928
04:17:20,210 --> 04:17:20,750
Oh, whoops.

3929
04:17:20,850 --> 04:17:22,230
That was whoops.

3930
04:17:22,950 --> 04:17:24,010
That's awkward.

3931
04:17:24,670 --> 04:17:25,270
Oh,

3932
04:17:30,470 --> 04:17:31,890
there you go.

3933
04:17:32,410 --> 04:17:32,410
28.

3934
04:17:32,730 --> 04:17:33,030
Nice.

3935
04:17:37,870 --> 04:17:39,550
All right, down I go.

3936
04:17:39,950 --> 04:17:40,290
Free gun.

3937
04:17:40,450 --> 04:17:40,750
Wow.

3938
04:17:41,270 --> 04:17:41,850
Look at that.

3939
04:17:42,310 --> 04:17:44,890
It's funny that someone left a gun there.

3940
04:17:45,450 --> 04:17:46,050
Oh, it's so silly

3941
04:17:50,150 --> 04:17:52,170
So silly guys

3942
04:17:57,640 --> 04:18:01,780
Can't believe they would leave like a properly working gun
just sitting there in the open

3943
04:18:05,300 --> 04:18:13,830
Yeah, so this way Oh my god, I'm trying my best Maria.

3944
04:18:14,490 --> 04:18:15,450
I swear to God

3945
04:18:19,580 --> 04:18:20,100
Okay.

3946
04:18:21,340 --> 04:18:21,720
Wait, wait.

3947
04:18:22,180 --> 04:18:25,240
There might be the 20th, 30th right here, somewhere.

3948
04:18:26,500 --> 04:18:28,960
The 30th is here lurking around.

3949
04:18:29,700 --> 04:18:30,360
Right here.

3950
04:18:30,520 --> 04:18:30,660
Okay.

3951
04:18:30,820 --> 04:18:31,360
Oh, thank God.

3952
04:18:31,480 --> 04:18:32,280
Alright, last guy.

3953
04:18:32,960 --> 04:18:35,360
I mean, there's still five more, but we don't...

3954
04:18:35,360 --> 04:18:37,020
We'll let the soldiers worry about that.

3955
04:18:37,680 --> 04:18:38,060
Yay!

3956
04:18:39,560 --> 04:18:42,500
Yeah, I almost ran into the ring there.

3957
04:18:44,460 --> 04:18:46,320
Thank God I had self-control.

3958
04:18:46,560 --> 04:18:48,700
I will protect the professor and the ark.

3959
04:18:51,660 --> 04:18:59,600
yeah oh my god that that level alone took me 26 minutes of
fucking hide and seek

3960

04:19:43,580 --> 04:19:52,240
once every 50 years that black comet passes by this planet
oh do you think those black creatures are somehow just

3965
04:19:52,240 --> 04:20:01,620
because the comet is black doesn't mean everyone comes from
it sonic I think you're right I feel it.

3966
04:20:02,120 --> 04:20:02,780
They're up there.

3967
04:20:03,560 --> 04:20:05,100
That's where the answers are.

3968
04:20:05,220 --> 04:20:06,140
I've got to get to that.

3969
04:20:06,140 --> 04:20:06,300
Oh my god.

Last level.

3975
04:20:15,460 --> 04:20:17,840

04:20:18,700 --> 04:20:21,060

them.

3992
04:21:21,910 --> 04:21:23,750
That would have been nice to know, Sonic.

3993
04:21:26,670 --> 04:21:27,070
Yahoo!

04:22:33,760 --> 04:22:34,280

4012
04:22:39,200 --> 04:22:40,580
I don't have to think for myself.

4013
04:22:41,120 --> 04:22:42,260
It's the black creature.

4014
04:22:44,700 --> 04:22:47,900
There's some of that red alien slime stuff on the wall.

4015
04:22:50,260 --> 04:22:50,500
Damn.

4016
04:22:51,000 --> 04:22:51,540
Not here.

4017
04:22:54,260 --> 04:22:56,360
Did I get a checkpoint?

4018
04:22:57,220 --> 04:22:58,440
No, I did not.

4019
04:22:58,600 --> 04:22:59,020
Alright.

4020
04:22:59,300 --> 04:23:00,640

04:23:01,160 --> 04:23:02,120
Here we go.

4022
04:23:02,600 --> 04:23:03,640
And I did not.

4023
04:23:03,820 --> 04:23:06,540
I did not unlock a checkpoint.

4024
04:23:07,440 --> 04:23:09,180
I hit the wolf because of course.

4025
04:23:09,200 --> 04:23:10,920
I did it.

4026
04:23:11,580 --> 04:23:12,540
Let's go.

4027
04:23:14,940 --> 04:23:16,840
Oh god, it's like an egg sack.

4028
04:23:17,080 --> 04:23:17,980
What the fuck?

4029
04:23:18,900 --> 04:23:21,340
It's like I'm holding a fucking egg sack.

4030
04:23:25,380 --> 04:23:26,360
It's okay.

4031
04:23:27,680 --> 04:23:28,860
Everything is fine.

4032
04:23:33,010 --> 04:23:33,830
I hear you.

4033
04:23:35,610 --> 04:23:39,150
I assume that I just gotta kill him, right?

4034
04:23:39,930 --> 04:23:40,990
Now Now what?

4035
04:23:42,070 --> 04:23:43,730
Now where the fuck do I go?

4036
04:23:45,410 --> 04:23:45,490

4037
04:23:49,230 --> 04:23:50,770

Alright, it's suck time.

4046
04:24:22,060 --> 04:24:22,200
Oh!

4047
04:24:23,700 --> 04:24:25,860
Okay, I figured it out, guys.

4048
04:24:28,800 --> 04:24:30,040

04:24:30,740 --> 04:24:31,880

4050
04:24:36,510 --> 04:24:37,870
Oh, that's cool.

4051
04:24:38,250 --> 04:24:40,110
Okay, that is actually a neat concept.

4052
04:24:41,350 --> 04:24:43,030
They finally introduced something new.

4053
04:24:43,770 --> 04:24:45,690
Wait, I want more of the fast travel.

4054
04:24:46,790 --> 04:24:47,750
me that fast travel.

4055
04:24:51,330 --> 04:24:57,550
I would say that is a unique, a neat utility, a neat ability
that they introduce.

4056
04:25:02,210 --> 04:25:04,690
God, that is so, I just don't like the sound effect for
that.

4057
04:25:06,950 --> 04:25:07,690
Oh, is that it?

4058
04:25:09,990 --> 04:25:10,450
Here?

4059
04:25:14,110 --> 04:25:14,690
In here?

4060
04:25:15,310 --> 04:25:16,350
Sonic, what the fuck?

4061
04:25:17,790 --> 04:25:19,630
You want me to go this way?

4062
04:25:20,610 --> 04:25:21,790
Oh, here!

4063
04:25:25,090 --> 04:25:26,750
Is that black doom?

4064
04:25:27,470 --> 04:25:27,930
Oh.

4065
04:25:29,830 --> 04:25:30,170
Oh.

4066
04:25:31,530 --> 04:25:33,490
Yeah, no shit is a fate.

4067
04:25:36,110 --> 04:25:36,830
There we go.

4068
04:25:37,590 --> 04:25:38,010
Nice.

4069
04:25:38,390 --> 04:25:39,670
The ultimate power.

4070
04:25:40,310 --> 04:25:41,690
The ultimate power!

4071
04:25:42,630 --> 04:25:45,210
Oh, okay, I'm here now.

4072
04:25:46,070 --> 04:25:46,510
Okay.

4073
04:25:47,970 --> 04:25:49,470
Where's the other one?

4074
04:25:53,190 --> 04:25:54,350
Green for a gamer.

4075
04:25:55,750 --> 04:25:56,930
Thank God for fast travel.

4076
04:25:57,430 --> 04:25:58,610
Oh, and thank God for checkpoint.

4077
04:25:58,830 --> 04:25:59,490
I was so scared.

4078
04:26:05,040 --> 04:26:05,560
It's okay.

4079
04:26:05,740 --> 04:26:08,320
They're like, come forth giants and stop him.

4080
04:26:08,420 --> 04:26:10,180
And then I just walk past him.

4081
04:26:11,660 --> 04:26:12,880
Like, what giant?

4082
04:26:14,160 --> 04:26:16,820
I just casually walk past all the fucking giants.

4083
04:26:17,400 --> 04:26:17,800
Yay.

4084
04:26:24,560 --> 04:26:27,140
Okay, it's fine.

4085
04:26:27,300 --> 04:26:27,580
It's fine.

4086
04:26:27,680 --> 04:26:28,380
We got the checkpoint.

4087
04:26:28,980 --> 04:26:29,500
It's okay.

4088
04:26:29,920 --> 04:26:30,980
We got the checkpoint.

4089
04:26:31,260 --> 04:26:32,520
Nothing to worry about.

4090
04:26:33,780 --> 04:26:35,120
It's not too much.

4091
04:26:35,220 --> 04:26:35,980
We're not too far.

4092
04:26:39,500 --> 04:26:41,940
We're not too far from progress.

4093
04:26:44,180 --> 04:26:47,040
Maybe I can casually just... Ah, fuck it.

4094
04:26:47,080 --> 04:26:47,800
I'm too lazy.

4095
04:26:49,120 --> 04:26:50,660
We do not just throw right at.

4096
04:26:53,580 --> 04:26:55,840
Why did you not jump on the other?

4097
04:26:55,940 --> 04:26:56,500
Okay, it's okay.

4098
04:26:56,640 --> 04:26:56,740
It's okay.

4099
04:26:56,960 --> 04:26:57,300
It's okay.

4100
04:26:57,720 --> 04:26:57,940
It's okay.

4101
04:26:58,040 --> 04:26:58,140
It's okay.

4102
04:26:58,140 --> 04:26:58,180
It's okay.

4103
04:26:58,180 --> 04:26:58,920
People make mistakes.

4104
04:26:59,160 --> 04:26:59,820
It's okay.

4105
04:27:00,960 --> 04:27:01,560
It's okay.

4106
04:27:02,120 --> 04:27:03,080
It's okay.

4107
04:27:03,440 --> 04:27:04,940
It's okay.

4108
04:27:10,080 --> 04:27:11,480
We can do this again.

4109
04:27:12,680 --> 04:27:13,980
We can do this again.

4110
04:27:14,240 --> 04:27:14,280
We can do this again.

4111
04:27:17,640 --> 04:27:21,250
We can do this again.

4112
04:27:22,010 --> 04:27:22,850
There we go.

4113
04:27:23,250 --> 04:27:23,770
There we go.

4114
04:27:23,930 --> 04:27:24,250
There we go.

4115
04:27:24,470 --> 04:27:24,470
See?

4116
04:27:24,830 --> 04:27:24,830
See?

4117
04:27:25,270 --> 04:27:25,970
It's okay.

4118
04:27:26,130 --> 04:27:26,470
It's okay.

4119
04:27:26,870 --> 04:27:27,570
Oh my god.

4120
04:27:27,790 --> 04:27:29,310
I swear to god if I didn't grab that check foot.

4121
04:27:30,570 --> 04:27:32,150
You know, everyone makes mistakes.

4122
04:27:38,960 --> 04:27:40,260
What the fuck?

4123
04:27:42,060 --> 04:27:43,600
Who's that guy in there?

4124
04:27:44,540 --> 04:27:45,300
Who is he?

4125
04:27:45,840 --> 04:27:46,480
It doesn't matter.

4126
04:27:46,500 --> 04:27:47,640
He must not be that important.

4127
04:27:49,060 --> 04:27:50,940
Yeah, he's not that important, right?

4128
04:27:56,450 --> 04:27:57,230
Come on.

4129
04:28:02,280 --> 04:28:02,880
It's okay.

4130
04:28:06,400 --> 04:28:06,800
Okay, nice.

4131
04:28:08,120 --> 04:28:08,800
I got it.

4132
04:28:12,340 --> 04:28:13,540
Oh, shit.

4133
04:28:14,160 --> 04:28:14,980
What's that?

4134
04:28:19,200 --> 04:28:20,140
All right, nice.

4135
04:28:21,600 --> 04:28:22,300
Got more ammo?

4136
04:28:23,020 --> 04:28:23,420
Oh, hey.

4137
04:28:24,400 --> 04:28:25,220
I got the suck.

4138
04:28:26,320 --> 04:28:27,340
The suck gun.

4139
04:28:28,820 --> 04:28:30,300
Where do I go now?

4140
04:28:30,540 --> 04:28:31,100
Oh, this is.

4141
04:28:31,120 --> 04:28:33,200
Oh, not like this.

4142
04:28:33,780 --> 04:28:34,100
Who do I?

4143
04:28:34,540 --> 04:28:35,420
Oh, shit.

4144
04:28:35,540 --> 04:28:36,600
Oh, that's what I suck.

4145
04:28:36,720 --> 04:28:36,960
Okay.

4146
04:28:40,500 --> 04:28:41,080
All right.

4147
04:28:41,520 --> 04:28:41,920
Oh, hey.

4148
04:28:42,140 --> 04:28:43,180
I'll grab this suck gun.

4149
04:28:44,960 --> 04:28:46,100
This is a better suck.

4150
04:28:50,700 --> 04:28:51,440
Oh, my God.

4151
04:28:51,620 --> 04:28:52,440
Where am I?

4152
04:28:54,980 --> 04:28:55,460
Here?

4153
04:28:58,300 --> 04:28:58,780
Yay!

4154
04:29:01,420 --> 04:29:02,780
Am I doing it?

4155
04:29:03,140 --> 04:29:03,620
Okay.

4156
04:29:04,780 --> 04:29:05,840
Okay, this way.

4157
04:29:11,440 --> 04:29:12,520
And then...

4158
04:29:15,620 --> 04:29:18,860
Thanks, Dad, for teaching me how to kill you.

4159
04:29:20,020 --> 04:29:21,820
I really appreciate it.

4160
04:29:23,020 --> 04:29:25,160
Thanks for teaching me how to kill you, Dad.

4161
04:29:27,920 --> 04:29:29,640
Oh, yeah, I'm waiting for you, too.

4162
04:29:31,020 --> 04:29:31,520
Suck.

4163
04:29:33,280 --> 04:29:34,400
Alright, this way.

4164
04:29:40,350 --> 04:29:40,710
Okay.

4165
04:29:42,050 --> 04:29:43,530
All right, this is where I...

4166
04:29:43,530 --> 04:29:44,950
This is where I kill my dad.

4167
04:29:46,630 --> 04:29:46,770
Ow!

4168
04:29:49,570 --> 04:29:51,510
Yeah, I don't think this is a human weapon.

4169
04:29:52,150 --> 04:29:54,790
This definitely does not look like a human weapon.

4170
04:29:54,910 --> 04:29:55,350
Oh, shit!

4171
04:29:55,430 --> 04:29:56,050
Okay, never mind.

4172
04:29:58,290 --> 04:29:59,390
Wait, how do I...

4173
04:30:01,010 --> 04:30:02,010
Where do I go?

4174
04:30:02,090 --> 04:30:02,930
Oh, it's over here.

4175
04:30:06,470 --> 04:30:07,350
And then...

4176
04:30:07,350 --> 04:30:07,930
This way?

4177
04:30:09,870 --> 04:30:11,370

04:30:11,390 --> 04:30:14,490

That's it.

4185
04:31:22,440 --> 04:31:25,040
There you go.

4186
04:31:26,120 --> 04:31:26,520

Oh, thank God.

4189
04:31:31,800 --> 04:31:33,140
I skipped everything here.

4190
04:31:33,620 --> 04:31:38,140
Oh, this level is so long.

4191
04:31:38,880 --> 04:31:40,340
Oh, my God.

4192
04:31:41,100 --> 04:31:41,500
All right.

4193
04:31:41,540 --> 04:31:42,600
How many checkpoints?

4194
04:31:42,880 --> 04:31:43,580
How many checkpoints?

4195
04:31:43,680 --> 04:31:44,180
Oh, my God.

4196
04:31:44,240 --> 04:31:45,260
There's still two more checkpoints.

4197
04:31:45,860 --> 04:31:59,900
Oh, my I was not expecting how the fact that this is
considered a massive I'm gonna try I need more fast travel I

It's okay.

4202
04:32:24,940 --> 04:32:25,200
It's okay.

4203
04:32:25,280 --> 04:32:26,000
I'm still fine.

4204
04:32:26,480 --> 04:32:27,940
He didn't actually hit me, apparently.

4205
04:32:31,360 --> 04:32:32,760
Uh, is that everybody?

4206
04:32:33,320 --> 04:32:34,340
Oh, don't!

4207
04:32:34,440 --> 04:32:35,140
I'm alive.

4208
04:32:35,480 --> 04:32:36,080
I'm alive.

4209
04:32:37,260 --> 04:32:37,940
I'm alive.

4210
04:32:38,140 --> 04:32:38,460
I don't know.

4211
04:32:38,540 --> 04:32:39,340
Oh, it's him.

4212
04:32:39,540 --> 04:32:40,460
He hit me.

4213
04:32:40,820 --> 04:32:42,140
It's okay, everybody.

4214
04:32:42,880 --> 04:32:43,680
I'm fine.

4215
04:32:45,780 --> 04:32:46,540
There I go.

4216
04:32:46,860 --> 04:32:47,740
Maybe it's up this way.

4217
04:32:48,820 --> 04:32:49,420
Oh, my God.

4218
04:32:49,680 --> 04:32:51,520
Oh, I almost had it.

4219
04:32:51,940 --> 04:32:53,000
Oh, okay.

4220
04:32:53,260 --> 04:32:54,180
Oh, That was close.

4221
04:32:54,520 --> 04:32:55,760
That was very close.

4222
04:32:57,100 --> 04:32:57,920
Oh, there he is.

4223
04:32:58,980 --> 04:32:59,780
Wait, is that him?

4224
04:33:01,560 --> 04:33:02,320
There he is.

4225
04:33:03,280 --> 04:33:04,240
Sonic, we did it!

4226
04:33:04,340 --> 04:33:05,000
We made it!

4227
04:33:07,160 --> 04:33:08,000
Don't fall.

4228
04:33:08,200 --> 04:33:09,120
That was so close.

4229
04:33:09,200 --> 04:33:09,860
I almost fell.

4230
04:33:10,140 --> 04:33:11,080
I actually almost fell.

4231
04:33:11,740 --> 04:33:13,560
So, we meet at last, Black Doom.

4232
04:33:14,200 --> 04:33:16,620
You're the one responsible for all this villain.

4233
04:33:16,740 --> 04:33:17,300
That's me.

4234

Bro, you're back on high ground, bro.

4256
04:35:55,280 --> 04:35:55,820
This ain't a fight.

4257
04:35:55,960 --> 04:35:57,300
This ain't a challenge anymore.

4258
04:35:58,780 --> 04:36:00,220
This is just sad.

4259
04:36:01,300 --> 04:36:04,480
You can dodge that light blade boomerang thing by jumping
over it.

4260
04:36:05,480 --> 04:36:06,080
Alright, nice.

4261
04:36:06,180 --> 04:36:08,320
At least he started going on high ground.

4262
04:36:08,980 --> 04:36:11,180
I got a little sad about it.

4263
04:36:11,760 --> 04:36:13,480
Hey, can I...

4264
04:36:13,480 --> 04:36:14,160
Okay, nice.

4265
04:36:20,350 --> 04:36:21,510
There's a red box.

4266
04:36:21,550 --> 04:36:22,030
Yeah, what is this?

4267
04:36:22,050 --> 04:36:23,310
this red box, actually.

4268
04:36:24,450 --> 04:36:25,270
Is this a gun?

4269
04:36:25,750 --> 04:36:28,450
Oh, I could have used a gun this entire time?

4270
04:36:28,690 --> 04:36:29,430
Alright, that's it.

4271
04:36:29,550 --> 04:36:29,730
It's over.

4272
04:36:33,410 --> 04:36:34,610
It's over.

4273
04:36:35,490 --> 04:36:37,450
It's over now that I know.

4274
04:36:39,930 --> 04:36:40,230
Wait.

4275
04:36:40,570 --> 04:36:41,090
Wait.

4276
04:36:41,430 --> 04:36:43,970
Why did none of my bullets hit him?

4277
04:36:44,550 --> 04:36:45,970
Wait a minute.

4278
04:36:46,890 --> 04:36:48,010
Wait a minute.

4279
04:36:48,010 --> 04:36:48,650
Wait a minute.

4280
04:36:54,090 --> 04:36:55,930
Got another gun.

4281
04:36:56,670 --> 04:36:57,710
Where is he?

4282
04:37:00,730 --> 04:37:01,370
What?

4283
04:37:07,050 --> 04:37:08,130
That's it.

4284
04:37:09,630 --> 04:37:10,230
Where is he?

4285
04:37:11,670 --> 04:37:12,270
Okay.

4286
04:37:13,350 --> 04:37:13,970
Okay.

4287
04:37:14,370 --> 04:37:15,930
This is like the worst one.

4288
04:37:17,670 --> 04:37:19,030
Wait, where did he go?

4289
04:37:21,370 --> 04:37:37,890

you're frozen how do you teleport away when you're frozen

4290
04:37:39,130 --> 04:37:41,970

4291
04:37:48,960 --> 04:37:51,760

Where's the last box?

4297
04:38:33,120 --> 04:38:33,220
Wait.

4298
04:38:34,020 --> 04:38:35,060

04:38:35,180 --> 04:38:36,040

Oh no, not this gun.

4302
04:38:46,900 --> 04:38:48,080

4303
04:38:49,020 --> 04:38:49,500
I...

4304
04:38:49,500 --> 04:38:50,980
Did she even hit him?

4305
04:38:54,640 --> 04:38:58,420

We did it, guys.

4310
04:39:36,360 --> 04:39:37,260
Sonic was there.

4311
04:39:38,260 --> 04:39:39,020
We did it!

4312
04:39:39,100 --> 04:39:40,080
And he was there.

4313
04:39:48,140 --> 04:39:49,160
Boom, thank you to Super Chat.

4314
04:39:49,280 --> 04:39:49,420
Thank you.

4315
04:39:49,800 --> 04:39:50,140
Thank you.

4316
04:39:50,300 --> 04:39:53,180
The Suckum is a reference to Billy Hatchin, a giant egg.

4317
04:39:53,300 --> 04:39:54,560
Oh, I love that game.

4318
04:39:54,960 --> 04:39:56,900
I had that game growing up.

4319
04:39:57,820 --> 04:39:58,600
It's fun.

4320
04:39:58,860 --> 04:40:00,760
I don't really remember much about it.

4321
04:40:00,880 --> 04:40:01,920
I just like rolling the egg.

4322
04:40:02,240 --> 04:40:03,080
I got all the chaos emeralds.

4323
04:40:04,440 --> 04:40:06,600
Sonic was like, I got off.

4324
04:40:06,660 --> 04:40:07,140
I.

4325
04:40:07,240 --> 04:40:12,660
The city don't bring us to be weak.

4326
04:40:18,280 --> 04:40:19,780
Let's do this.

4327
04:40:21,000 --> 04:40:22,500
I'm Shadow the Hedgehog.

4328
04:40:23,100 --> 04:40:25,940
And I made a promise that I intend to keep.

4329
04:40:26,700 --> 04:40:30,940
With the power of these emeralds, Black Doom and his army
are finished.

4330
04:40:31,400 --> 04:40:32,980
This is who I am.

4331
04:40:33,320 --> 04:40:33,800
Yay!

4332
04:40:40,040 --> 04:40:40,540

Oh no!

4339
04:41:03,250 --> 04:41:05,930
That's crazy that they made like a song for each ending.

4340
04:41:08,010 --> 04:41:09,610
And you're all like pretty good too.

4341
04:41:11,090 --> 04:41:11,870

Oh, no.

4351
04:42:37,020 --> 04:42:41,000
found a meeting that you searched for so long.

4352
04:42:45,600 --> 04:42:46,860
Oh, hell's shadows.

4353
04:42:48,980 --> 04:42:50,920
Oh, no, bum, bum.

4354
04:42:53,800 --> 04:42:55,460
No, bum, bum,

4355
04:43:09,040 --> 04:43:10,900
God, is this so edgy?

4356
04:43:21,630 --> 04:43:24,290
Oh my god, Shreddy Guitar Man!

4357
04:43:24,490 --> 04:43:26,730
You go, Guitar Man!

4358
04:43:33,360 --> 04:43:34,000
Shadow!

4359
04:43:57,120 --> 04:43:57,240
Woo!

4360
04:44:00,140 --> 04:44:01,920
The anthem of...

4361
04:44:01,920 --> 04:44:03,580
It gets me every time.

4362
04:44:04,220 --> 04:44:06,100
It just... I don't know.

4363
04:44:06,800 --> 04:44:08,540
It just gets me every time.

4364
04:44:09,400 --> 04:44:11,140
Last story on the...

4365
04:44:11,140 --> 04:44:12,560
I see the light.

4366
04:44:13,180 --> 04:44:14,900
Oh my god, I see the light.

4367
04:44:17,340 --> 04:44:18,600
It's there.

4368
04:44:18,920 --> 04:44:20,580
It's actually there.

4369
04:44:23,840 --> 04:44:29,080
There's actually a light in this whole 50-year return of the
black comet.

4370
04:44:34,560 --> 04:44:37,640
At last I see the light.

4371
04:44:38,820 --> 04:44:43,220
Finally, I've got all the chaos emeralds.

4372
04:44:44,020 --> 04:44:47,560
Now, I can uncover the truth about my past.

4373
04:44:47,580 --> 04:44:49,620
Oh my god.

4374
04:44:50,600 --> 04:44:51,300
Wait, what?

4375
04:44:51,660 --> 04:44:52,840
Didn't I kill you?

4376
04:44:54,560 --> 04:44:55,140
Wait, what?

4377
04:44:56,660 --> 04:44:59,740
Give me the chaos emeralds.

4378
04:45:03,280 --> 04:45:06,200
Wait, I never, Amy never showed up in my playthrough.

4379
04:45:07,620 --> 04:45:10,520
Do not give the emeralds to black doom, Shadow.

4380
04:45:10,660 --> 04:45:12,360
I was like, where did Amy come from?

4381
04:45:15,860 --> 04:45:17,100
Ignorant fools.

4382
04:45:17,580 --> 04:45:22,040
We're here to save the humans from their own demise.

4383
04:45:22,240 --> 04:45:24,580
We offer salvation.

4384
04:45:25,020 --> 04:45:25,740
I told you.

4385
04:45:25,800 --> 04:45:27,520
See, the aliens are the good guys.

4386
04:45:29,140 --> 04:45:31,620
We were trying to help the humans.

4387
04:45:31,740 --> 04:45:35,100
This ring has them on a path of self-destruction.

4388
04:45:35,860 --> 04:45:38,060
Wait, cream the rabbits in this game too?

4389
04:45:38,240 --> 04:45:39,800
The extinction of their species.

4390
04:45:40,660 --> 04:45:43,060
We're here to save them from themselves.

4391
04:45:43,480 --> 04:45:46,400
I guess she wasn't invited to the chaos meeting.

4392
04:45:49,100 --> 04:45:51,640
He sounds like such a good person.

4393
04:45:54,620 --> 04:45:57,140
Oh, so it's like a zoo.

4394
04:45:59,800 --> 04:46:02,040
Well, he did specify humans.

4395
04:46:02,440 --> 04:46:03,920
So like the hedgehogs are safe.

4396
04:46:04,080 --> 04:46:05,580
The animals are safe.

4397
04:46:07,560 --> 04:46:11,820
Wait, how did Shadow just let him take the chaos just like
that?

4398
04:46:17,400 --> 04:46:19,400
I like how he just let it happen.

4399
04:46:31,140 --> 04:46:31,820
Oh?

4400
04:46:36,360 --> 04:46:37,640
Is the president okay?

4401
04:46:37,940 --> 04:46:38,600
What just happened?

4402
04:46:39,580 --> 04:46:43,680
Those black creatures just warped the comet down to the
surface using chaos control.

4403
04:46:44,420 --> 04:46:44,460
Ah!

4404
04:46:45,020 --> 04:46:46,740
No, that's impossible.

4405
04:46:46,980 --> 04:46:49,000
The comet wasn't black either, it was red.

4406
04:46:49,460 --> 04:46:51,400
Chaos Emeralds.

4407
04:46:55,820 --> 04:46:56,500
Precisely.

4408
04:46:57,400 --> 04:47:03,280
The comet's velocity isn't powerful enough to pass through
another planet.

That can't be.

4418
04:48:07,800 --> 04:48:10,280
He betrayed his own people for research.

4419
04:48:10,640 --> 04:48:11,180
For black...

4420
04:48:11,180 --> 04:48:12,660

04:48:20,380 --> 04:48:22,080
A bit of a hypocrite there.

04:48:38,600 --> 04:48:44,900

4438
04:49:15,120 --> 04:49:15,880
Did I...

4439
04:49:15,880 --> 04:49:16,320
Did I?

4440
04:49:16,900 --> 04:49:17,120
What?

4441
04:49:17,920 --> 04:49:20,160

I have shadow of Hedgehog.

4447
04:49:41,520 --> 04:49:43,280
I've left the past behind me.

4448
04:49:43,380 --> 04:49:45,620
The power of edginess and Maria.

4449
04:49:46,760 --> 04:49:48,740
I will destroy you, Black Doom.

4450
04:49:49,760 --> 04:49:50,220
Black.

4451
04:49:50,380 --> 04:49:51,340
I gave you your life.

4452
04:49:51,840 --> 04:49:54,080
And this is how you repay me.

4453
04:49:56,580 --> 04:49:58,220
Just say no.

4454
04:49:59,000 --> 04:50:00,020

05:11:45,520 --> 05:12:00,960
I just say no I now understand why I am here I made a
promise and I'm here to keep it today just say no it's just

4760
05:12:00,980 --> 05:12:01,760
that easy.

4761
05:12:05,160 --> 05:12:07,220
The power of free will.

4762
05:12:07,620 --> 05:12:08,260
So be it.

4763
05:12:08,800 --> 05:12:11,000
Be prepared to meet your maker.

4764
05:12:11,860 --> 05:12:15,620
Your past, present, and future ends here.

4765
05:12:16,080 --> 05:12:16,460
Today.

4766
05:12:17,160 --> 05:12:21,880
I was like, if he kills the planet, all the Latinas would
die.

4767
05:12:22,480 --> 05:12:23,900
Can't let that happen.

4768
05:12:27,560 --> 05:12:30,100
Oh my god, I'm going super saiyan.

4769
05:12:30,980 --> 05:12:38,000
works because like he's he's the voice actor of Goku too
well not him but like the evil guy that's actually crazy

4770
05:12:38,000 --> 05:12:49,860
that's actually funny but they had the super saiyan concept
and then the main villain is voiced by Goku all hell shadow

4771
05:12:49,860 --> 05:12:57,220
what the fuck how do I kill Oh, this guy.

4772
05:13:00,480 --> 05:13:01,120
What the?

4773
05:13:02,900 --> 05:13:03,300
What?

4774
05:13:04,800 --> 05:13:05,880
What do I do?

4775
05:13:14,380 --> 05:13:15,900
Wait, open your eyes!

4776
05:13:23,240 --> 05:13:24,220
You can get more...

4777
05:13:24,220 --> 05:13:25,180
Oh, there he is!

4778
05:13:26,420 --> 05:13:27,700
Or how do I get more rings?

4779
05:13:34,060 --> 05:13:34,500

4780
05:13:34,660 --> 05:13:35,260
Oh, shit!

4781
05:13:38,560 --> 05:13:40,340
Do these give me rings?

4782
05:13:41,960 --> 05:13:42,840
Oh, they do.

4783
05:13:44,200 --> 05:13:45,380
Okay, that's his butt.

4784
05:13:46,420 --> 05:13:47,260
We gotta go to the front.

4785
05:13:49,120 --> 05:13:51,020
I assume that that is butt.

4786
05:13:55,140 --> 05:13:56,760
Okay, that's his ass.

4787
05:13:57,820 --> 05:13:58,780

05:14:57,470 --> 05:14:58,870
I thought the other one was that

4794
05:15:02,650 --> 05:15:17,510
I think like spamming it is like stronger Only because I do
more damage with spam Look, just because I spam it a lot.

4795
05:15:28,040 --> 05:15:35,520
I was going to say, if he has two heads, then like, how does
he, you know, like, use the bathroom, you know?

4796
05:15:36,180 --> 05:15:38,480
Ask him the important questions here.

05:15:42,120 --> 05:15:43,080
Chaos Control!

4798
05:15:45,260 --> 05:15:45,660

Let us pay homage to Professor Gerald.

future.

Goodbye forever.

4843
05:19:48,440 --> 05:19:49,700
Shadow the Hedgehog.

4844
05:19:54,260 --> 05:19:54,560
Oh.

4845
05:19:58,740 --> 05:20:02,000
Wait, if he's not Shadow the Hedgehog, who would he be?

4846
05:20:03,240 --> 05:20:05,220
That's all you are.

4847
05:20:05,660 --> 05:20:06,900
That's all you have.

4848
05:20:10,680 --> 05:20:11,740
Sayonara's shadow.

4849
05:20:13,100 --> 05:20:16,120
And then it took like how many years till the next...

4850
05:20:16,120 --> 05:20:16,700
It took like what?

4851
05:20:16,820 --> 05:20:20,200
20 plus years till we got another shadow game.

4852
05:20:25,520 --> 05:20:26,120
Goodbye.

4853
05:20:26,880 --> 05:20:27,700
It's crazy.

4854
05:20:28,300 --> 05:20:30,500
It's crazy that this game did not do that well.

Meep, they gave him the 10 gift the ships, thank you.

4856
05:20:36,140 --> 05:20:45,040

understand why this game did not do so well.

4857
05:20:48,440 --> 05:20:50,640
I wonder why.

4858
05:20:51,200 --> 05:20:54,800

endings.

Shadow was controlling me I don't understand you never

4874
05:23:18,340 --> 05:23:20,600
warfare with the controls

4875
05:23:24,700 --> 05:23:31,840
and that just shows how good the game is you know you would
think that you are in control but in the end the game is in

4876
05:23:31,840 --> 05:23:35,280
control of you and that's what makes it even better

4877
05:23:39,410 --> 05:23:49,970
you have exactly it builds characters you know you have to
be strong to be shadow if you can't conquer the controls you

Alright guys that was an adventure It truly was an adventure

4894
05:25:29,200 --> 05:25:30,900
playing Shadow the Hedgehog.

4895
05:25:30,940 --> 05:25:36,440
This was the one Sonic game that I've always wanted to play
a Cowling.

4896
05:25:36,800 --> 05:25:39,080
Yes, we got the true ending.

4897
05:25:39,680 --> 05:25:47,780
Like I said, guys, if I have, if I have too much love for
this game, then like, then it's not good.

4898
05:25:47,880 --> 05:25:49,900
Like, too much is a bad thing, you know?

4899
05:25:50,200 --> 05:25:52,260
I want to keep, you know, I want, I won't.

4900
05:25:53,720 --> 05:25:57,020
You can't have too much of a good thing, guys.

4901
05:25:57,060 --> 05:26:01,800
Then you would get Then you'll get overloaded with too much
love.

4902
05:26:05,920 --> 05:26:08,280
Yeah, too much edge and you'll get cut.

4903
05:26:08,460 --> 05:26:10,080
Exactly, exactly.

4904
05:26:11,000 --> 05:26:20,080
All right, I had a fun time going through Shadow the
Hedgehog and seeing where all the memes come from,

4905
05:26:20,400 --> 05:26:20,660
basically.

4906
05:26:21,200 --> 05:26:23,960
Yeah, we can't be too parasocial with Shadow, guys.

4907
05:26:24,000 --> 05:26:28,020
We gotta distance, gotta give ourselves some space.

4908
05:26:28,040 --> 05:26:41,480
you know so our love can still keep going um anyway like I
said this was the one game I've always wanted to play and um

4909
05:26:41,480 --> 05:26:50,300
and I'm glad to experience shadow the hedgehog with all of
you guys I've never played this game before but I have heard

4910
05:26:50,300 --> 05:27:00,620
all the stories all the stories about shadow the hedgehog so
it's great experience it for the first time, blind with all

4911
05:27:00,620 --> 05:27:05,100
of you guys, and see all the memes and everything that came
with it.

4912
05:27:05,580 --> 05:27:10,780
Um, um, honestly, don't know how I just never got a sequel
or remastered.

4913
05:27:10,940 --> 05:27:12,880
I mean, it's, it was already perfect.

4914
05:27:13,280 --> 05:27:17,700
Uh, don't know why.

4915
05:27:18,180 --> 05:27:21,280
Um, anyway, I'm gonna head off now.

4916
05:27:21,500 --> 05:27:26,020
I will be gone for three days because I need to reset
myself.

4917
05:27:26,860 --> 05:27:34,620
I've been extremely like social battery very low lately the
